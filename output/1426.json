Last\nyear, felix reported that the funding\nwas eventually found for Phase Two\nafter the College agreed to give \u00a31.93\nmillion towards the fund [Issue 1391\n\u2013 11.01.08].\nEven though the story was reported\nover a year ago, students are still confused as to why parts of the Union\nBuilding have been blocked off and\neven more worrying, they didn\u2019t seem\nto know how the Union was going to\nchange once the construction was\nfinished.\nAt the moment, most of the work that\nis going on in the Union is for the creation of a mezzanine level on the second\nfloor where the new Student Activity\nCentre [SAC] will be stationed, which\nsi why parts of Db\u2019s and DaVinci\u2019s have\nbeen blocked to allow room for risers.\nBelow the SAC the main cluster of offices will be located, where all the Sabbaticals and Union staff will be work-ing. They layout for the Union offices\nis still unsure, however the latest plans\nshow that they will be open plan apart\nfrom the Union President and the\nGeneral Manager who will have their\noffice.\nThe work for Phase Two was supposed to be finished by January 2009\naccording to last years article, but as\ncan plainly be seen, the contractors are\nstill in the Union working away. Peter\nHaldane, General Manager for Imperial College Union, told felix that \u201cYou\namaze me, I\u2019d like to see what it is you\nbase that on.\u201d\nHe then went on to explain that\n\u201cWhen work for Phase 2 was put in\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk News\nBill Gates gives \u00a35 million\nto Imperial College\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundations\nhas given Imperial College London a\n\u00a35 million grant. The money will support an initiative that is manufacturing\ninexpensive home tests for HIV in developing countries.\nThe CD4 initiative was launched\nwith the aim of devising an easy to use\npoint-of-care test with a cost of around\n$2. Currently three prototypes have\nbeen developed, one of which will be\nmass produced in 2010.\nThis is not the first time that the Bill\n& Melinda Gates Foundations have\nsupported the CD4 initiative. A 2005\ngrant of almost \u00a36 million supported\nthe first three years of the initiative.\nThe latest grant will go towards trials\nof the device in developed and developing countries as well as funding initial production runs.\nMeasuring a patients CD4+ T-cells\nis a critical part of the HIV treatment\nprocess. Healthcare workers rely on a\nCD4 count to make decisions about\nantiretroviral therapy. Many patients\nin developing countries do not have\naccess to CD4 testing because of cost\nand the fact that specially trained operators are needed. The new test will\nnot involve electronis or mechanical\nparts, it will tell patients within minutes if antiretroviral treatment should\nbe started.\n\u201cThere has been a lot of progress\nincreasing access to life-saving HIV\ndrugs in the developing world, but the\nlack of access to essential diagnostic\ntests like a CD4 test is a major barrier\nto providing the best possible care,\u201d\nsaid Dr Hans-Georg Batz, Director of\nthe CD4 Initiative from the Division of\nMedicine at Imperial College London.\n\u201cThe majority of patients start antiretroviral therapy based on symptoms\nalone. Research shows that if you wait\nuntil you\u2019re sick to start treatment, you\nhave a much poorer outcome than if\nyou start based on CD4 count. Our\nnew test will have a huge positive impact for people living with HIV across\nthe world.\u201d\nDr Steven Reid, the project manager\nfor the CD4 Initiative at Imperial College London, added that the reduced\ntime waiting for a result was a great\nstep forward: \u201cIn resource-poor rural\nareas, patients sometimes have to walk\nmiles to get to a clinic. Even if a traditional CD4 count is offered, the patients have to come back in a couple of\nweeks for the result. By then, some are\ntoo sick or cannot afford to return. For\nOne of the richest men in the world, Bill Gates, has donated money to\nImperial on a number of occasions\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nAPOLOGY TO THE RECTOR\nIn part two of the interview with the Rector Sir Roy Anderson,\nwhich came out in Issue 1425 (20.02.09), an error was made. felix\nquoted the Rector as saying \u201cI have no trouble with high quality\nresearchers saying that they don\u2019t have time for teaching\u201d whereas\nin fact he actually said \u201cI have no truck with high quality researchers saying that they don\u2019t have time for teaching.\u201d\nfelix apologises for the mistake made\nand any problems that this misquote\ncould have caused.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nothers, it may already be too late.\u201d\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has also made contributions to\nImperial in other areas. In 2005 a\ngrant of \u00a315 million was given to Imperial from the Grand Challenges in\nGlobal Health Initiative programme\nof research sponsored by the Bill and\nMelinda Gates Foundation. The money\nwas divided between the development\nof drugs for the treatment of latent TB\nand the development of genetic strategies to block the spread of malaria by\nmosquitoes.\nBill Gates holds an honorary Doctorate of Science (Medicine) from Imperial College London.\nhand the programme indicated completion in mid June 2009. That was\ndelayed by 6 weeks as electrical issues\ncame to light; identifying, tracing and\nterminating old circuits. However, the\nprogramme has now been extended to\ninclude the extra work, fitting out the\n2nd floor West as new Union offices,\nwhich was not included in the original Phase 2 programme but has been\nmade possible by Phase 2 coming in\nunder budget. The contractor expects\nto have all aspects of Phase 2 completed by mid September 2009.\u201d\nThe final work to be carried out in\nthe Union will focus on the remodelling of the ground floor, which will\ninclude the expansion of Da Vinci\u2019s\nkitchen to connect with DB\u2019s servery,\nwhich will mean that hot food can be\nserved on both sides. Other work will\ninclude refurbishment Da Vinci\u2019s and\nUnion Bar, including cellar modifica-tion, as well as a redesign of Db\u2019s. As\nfar as felix is aware, the redesign will\nsee the stage moved to the back of the\nroom, creating a bigger open space\nand a better, concentrated focus on the\nstage for different acts.\nHopefully the new and improved\nUnion will be ready just after the new\nyear for students to enjoy.\nVisa fee hike will deter\nvaluable overseas students,\nfear Vice-chancellors\nThe Government\u2019s plans to reorganise the entry of overseas students is\nputting higher education into jeopardy,\nvice-chancellors fear. Rising visa application costs are the latest development\nin a line of measures the Government\nhave implemented to administrate the\nconsiderable proportions of foreign\nstudents at British Universities.\nThe Home Office\u2019s fee for a student\nvisa application has already increased\nfrom \u00a399 to \u00a3145. Further mandatory\ncosts that potential students must pay\nto even apply at British universities are\nset to increase. Students applying for\nVisas extensions by post in 2009-2010\nwill now cost each individual \u00a3357, \u00a363\nmore than the current fee. In-person\napplications will incur a \u00a365 increase\nto \u00a3565.\nVice-chancellors are worried whilst\nthe fee increases are not massive, they\nwill be combined with several new\nmeasures to ensure the governance\nof overseas students. This in turn will\ndeter the most talented students from\nenrolling at UK universities, many who\nare also courted by American, Australian and European universities.\nDiana Warwick, chief executive of\nUniversities UK, an umbrella group\nfor UK vice-chancellors said: \u201cThe increase in fees will come at the same\ntime as a number of other changes in\nthe UK\u2019s immigration system and the\nUK government is in serious danger of\nsending out a message that it does not\nwelcome international students.\u201d\nLast August saw the announcement\nthat Universities and colleges will be\nrequired to \u201csponsor\u201d students that are\napplying. These institutions first must\nbe licensed by the UKBA. Effectively,\nit will make the visa application for\ninternational candidates much more\ndifficult. Felix further reported last\nyear the introduction of compulsory\nID cards being issued for international\nstudents renewing their VISA.\nMore than 100,000 students from\nDan Wan\nNews Editor\nabroad commenced an UK degree\nprogramme for the 2008 intake. These\nnumbers include undergraduate and\npostgraduate courses. Warwick argues\nthese \u201cinternational students contribute far more to the UK academically,\nculturally and financially than they use\nin terms of public resources.\u201d\nImperial College would be severely\naffected if the detriments of these\nmeasures started to become evident,\nwith 34.9% of its student body international students. Imperial, a university that prides itself on its diversity\namongst its student body, will not only\nbe harmed academically and socially,\nbut also financially. Each international\nstudent can pay up to \u00a335,500 per academic year for their education at Imperial College.\nA similar impact is expected to be\nseen on other Russell Group univer-sities. However, the 1994 Group is\nunderstandably concerned also. Paul\nMarshall, executive director, said:\n\u201cInternational student recruitment is\nso delicate that something as small as\nchanging the price of the visa application fee can have a large effect on applications if students are choosing between countries and we\u2019re charging a\nlot of money up front for a visa.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that potentially\nputs people off coming here \u2013 it gives\nthe wrong message.\u201d\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nDiana Warwick, chief executive of\nUniversities UK\nMedics win yet another nail\nbiting JPR Williams Cup\nWednesday\u2019s JPR Williams Cup was yet another nail biting and\nclose encounter between the Imperial Medicals and Imperial\nCollege. With both teams in the South Premiership B and both\nteams struggling in that league, the stage was set for a hard\nfought battle. The crowd were certainly not disappointed. Imperial\nCollege were dominant for most of the game, but their inability\nto convert penalties to points cost them the match with the\ngame finishing at 7-7 at the end of regular time. In extra time,\nthe Medicals stepped up to the challenge and eventually won\nthe game 15-7. On the plus side, Imperial were named the overall\nwinners of the event and a full round-up will be found in the The\nRival, which will be out on the 20th March.\nphoto\nby\nJoe\nMuddiman\nThe mezzanine floor that will house the new and improved Student\nActivity Centre, with the Union Offices just below\nUnion Dining Hall: Unchanged\nDb\u2019s: Stage moving to the far end\nof the room\nStudent Activity Centre: On a new\nmezzanine level\nNew Union Offices: Open plan office\nfor Sabbs and full time Union staff\nDance Area: New facility for dance\nclasses\nThey say a picture can say a thousand words, hopefully this very crude image will enlighten you as to what\nis going on.

Oscar season has come and gone,\nand I am pretty sure everyone knows who the big\nwinners and sore losers\nwere at the Academy Awards ceremony this year, held in the Kodak Theatre\nin Los Angeles. Just in case you didn\u2019t,\nI have provided a list of the winners\nof the Big Six gongs of the night \u2013 the\nawards that everyone waits nervously\n(and sometimes impatiently) for.\nYou might be surprised and shocked\nto hear that this movie maniac actually stayed up way past his bedtime in\norder to watch the Oscars live, as they\nunfolded halfway across the globe.\nWhy you might ask? Well yes, it is a little bit sad, but every respectable film\ncritic has to do it at least once in their\nlife! But because I was sucked into it,\nI felt like I was experiencing the dizzying heights and embarrassing lows\nof the evening along with the cr\u00e8me\nde la cr\u00e8me of A-list celebrities and\nHugh Jackman shows off his excellent Broadway entertainment skills\nIt\u2019s funny, really. I haven\u2019t grown to appreciate Clint Eastwood\u2019s recent films\nof \u201cgreat emotional power\u201d (Mystic\nRiver) or those where \u201cnew emotional\nheights\u201d were reached (Million Dollar\nBaby). Both were by-the-book dramas,\ndespite being well executed and left me\nso empty that I simply could not understand what all the fuss was about \u2013 and\nif you\u2019ve read any of my other articles,\nyou know I don\u2019t shy away from sad\ntales of redemption. But sometimes\neven good films fall flat because they\u2019re\ntoo focused on the dramatic spectacle\nthat\u2019s unfolding and not so much on\nthe drama itself. Surely, it\u2019s a matter of\npersonal taste and interpretation, because otherwise I\u2019d have to stop believing in my sense of value.\nGran Torino is an effort that feels\nmuch more down to earth. It does not\ntake itself too seriously and yet manages to strike a good balance between\nwhat works and what doesn\u2019t. Sure,\nthe central character, Walt Kowalski,\nis shaped from the same mould as\n\u201cDirty\u201d Harry Callahan with a pinch of\nself-irony, and the story is not particularly imaginative, but Eastwood uses\nboth to create a romantically nostalgic\ncharacter that keeps the film together.\nWalt is a sour old war veteran, the\ntypical image of the strict and ultraconservative tough guy and the movie\nbegins with his wife\u2019s funeral. Nowadays, the old man is finding it difficult\nto come to terms with the idea that his\nneighbourhood has become ethnically\nThe most eagerly awaited night of the year for anyone in the movie industry may have been and gone, but\nJonathan Dakin denied himself sleep to bring us the night\u2019s recap.\nhigh powered movers and shakers of\none of the world\u2019s most powerful and\nsuccessful industries. I jumped on the\nOscar train and was dragged along\nfor the ride, so I thought it would be\nrelevant that I write an article chronicling the whole event.\nFor me and for the rest of the coun-try, the Oscars began at 11pm, and I\nswitched over to Sky 1 to see Fearne\nCotton standing on the red carpet,\ntrying her hardest to grab and interview celebrities as they arrived at\nbiggest night of the year for movies.\nShe was fairly unsuccessful, mainly\nbecause she was not pushy enough especially as she was standing next to E!\nEntertainment\u2019s Ryan Seacrest (who\npresents American Idol), so he was\ngetting all the big name stars before\nher, and once they had been interviewed by him they left the area and\nmoved to another. Poor Fearne. She\ntried her hardest and did do a good\njob, but spent most of the time talking about the glamorous dresses the\nstars were wearing, and occasionally\nsspeaking to Seacrest himself, when\nhe was taking a rest for a commercial\nbreak.\nAt 1am, we were promised the OsFinally, at 1.30am, presenter Hugh\nJackman, recently voted \u2018Sexiest\nMan in the World\u2019, began by singing\na moderately funny song that insulted all of the films nominated. Anne\nHathaway was pulled out of the audience and joined him, singing and\ndancing together under the dazzling\nProscenium Arch of the stage. Everyone smiled and laughed. Then a new\nlayout was introduced: five previous\nwinners came out together and talked\nabout each of the five nominees and\ntheir roles for the category. I really\nliked this approach \u2013 it felt fresh and\nexciting and was far more dynamic\nthen just watching clips from the\nfilms.\nFirst up was Best Supporting Actress, and out came the five previous\nwinners \u2013 one of them was comedy\nicon and my favourite actress of all\ntime, Whoopi Goldberg. She was on\ntop form as usual, making hilarious\njokes and stealing the moment from\nthe other four women. And the winner of Best Supporting Actress was\u2026\nPenelope Cruz \u2013 I was very happy\nabout this, as I felt it was about time\nthat she was recognised for her acting\ntalent!\nAfter this, time began to blur into\na hazy fog as tiredness began to set\nin. Man On Wire won for Best Documentary \u2013 and the trapeze artist the\nfilm is about was so happy about it\nhe balanced the Oscar on his chin.\nThen Seth Rogan (from Knocked\nUp) and James Franco (from Spiderman) tried their hardest at being\nfunny and failed miserably. They also\ncame across as spectacularly rude by\nmispronouncing a German winner\u2019s\nname and then laughing about it \u2013 I\nguess it shows how knowledgeable\nthey are about other cultures. I\u2019m\nsure it wouldn\u2019t have been hard to\nask someone beforehand how to pronounce the names\u2026\nThe lowest point of the evening\ncame when a painfully wooden Daniel Craig and a clearly uncomfortable\nSarah-Jessica Parker attempted to\nread an autocue whilst pretending to\nhave some sort of chemistry. As much\nas I like the new Bond, he doesn\u2019t really seem to have any personality at\nall and was just terrible at feigning\nan interest in talking about the nomi-nees. Oh dear.\nBut on the plus side, this horrible\nevent was followed by the most thrilling and amazing highlight of the\nevening \u2013 a show-stopping performance by R&B beauty Beyonce. Along\nwith Jackman and some of the stars of\nHigh School Musical and Mamma Mia, she sang a compilation\nof songs from famous musi-cals. Of course she stole the\nshow and out sang everyone,\nas the kids from High School\nand Mamma Mia were completely washed out, but what\ndid honestly you expect?\nJackman managed\nto hold his own\nzat least as he\nsung with her,\nimpressing everyone including\nmyself. Once\nBeyonce had\nfinished I\nleapt off of\nmy sofa for a\nstanding ovation. Maybe\nI was getting too carried\naway\u2026\nSteve Martin did some\npresenting and was very\nfunny, as was Cuba Gooding Jr. Heath Ledger was\npredictably announced\nBest Supporting Actor and\nthere was not a dry eye in\nthe house. Crocodile tears\nflooded the theatre (par-ticularly from actor Adrian\nBrody) and it seemed like\neveryone was deeply moved\n(or were they \u2013 they are after\nall, actors). Call me cynical,\nbut was Heath really the best\nsupporting actor of the year\nor did he just win because he\ndied? I am not doubting the\nfact that he gave a very good\nperformance- I just question\nwhether it was Oscar-worthy?!\nBut regardless of what this\ncynic thinks \u2013 congratulations to him!\nAfter several more painful auto-cued presenta-tions, a ray of sunlight in\nthe form of Will Smith\npopped out and showed everyone\nhow to do it, mainly because he actually seemed happy to be there!\nIt was 3.55am now, and no other big\nawards had been announced. I was\nless than impressed, especially because the people winning the awards\nfor things like Best Make-up did not\nseem particularly happy to win.\nOf course it is good to stay\ncomposed \u2013 but at least crack\na smile!\nFinally John Legend broke\nup some of the tedium by\nsinging, although he was accompanied by some horrible,\nscreeching, Bangra mu-sic. I am not a fan of\nBangra music; although the man\nwho composed\nthis song went\non to win an\nOscar for\nit. As I unplugged my\nfingers from\nmy ears, I\nseriously questioned this decision.\nAt 4.10am a Japanese\nman won an award and\nevery Japanese person\nin the audience followed\nhim on stage. I was beginning to feel restless\nand tired. Why had none\nof the good awards been\ngiven out yet? Why was\nKate not holding an Oscar?\nWhy was I still compelled\nto watch? Why?? Then the\nawards got even more depressing when the great\nQueen Latifah sang a song\nabout everyone who had\ndied in the past year. Not\nthe kind of thing you want\nto watch at 4.15am in the\nmorning when you are extremely tired and irritable.\nFinally at 4.20am, they\nannounced Best Director.\nAnd I was shocked. I never\nthought they would give\nit to an Englishman \u2013\nbut good on him!\nThen at 4.30am all\nof my waiting finally\npaid off when they announced what\nI had been waiting to hear all night:\nKATE WINSLET WINS!! I am not\ngoing to lie: just before the announcement I was clutching the sofa in nervous anticipation. I thought Meryl\nmight add another trophy to her cabi-net, but Kate deservedly won. Well\ndone Kate! I had my English flag out a\nwaved it jubilantly as I jumped up and\ndown, screaming in delight!\n4.40am (you can tell I was really getting impatient now as I was intensely\nwatching the clock): Sean Penn wins\nBest Actor \u2013 another shocking win.\nPoor Mickey Rourke! I couldn\u2019t help\nbut feel really sorry for him as he was,\nafter all, tipped to win it! Instead,\nPenn smugly took to the stage.\n4.50am: Slumdog Millionaire wins\nBest Picture, and half of India goes to\nthe podium along with the cast and\ncrew. People smile at the little kids\nwho were shipped over from Mumbai\nto show that they weren\u2019t paid peanuts for acting in the film. Everyone\nis happy. Everyone has realised finally\nthat the English film industry can\nmake good films! Hurrah!\nHugh Jackman walks out and says\n\u201cThank you\u201d, credits roll: the end.\nThe End?? Yes, the end. It was very\nabrupt! I felt like I wanted more time\nto see the winners but I was happy it\nwas finally over \u2013 I needed SLEEP!\nAs I dragged myself off of my sofa\nto bed at 5am, I was left with a few\nthoughts to ponder over about the\nmovie industry;\n1) It is very political. When the\nwriter of Milk won Best Screenplay,\nhe took his opportunity to promote\ngay rights \u2013 as did Sean Penn. I have a\nfeeling this has something to do with\nthe recent repeal of gay marriage in\nCalifornia\u2026\n2) Did Slumdog Millionaire really\ndeserve eight awards? Did it really??\nI am proud that an English film and\nEnglish director has been very suc-cessful, as well as the fact that Americans didn\u2019t just vote for an American\nfilm \u2013 but was it really the best film of\nthe year? See my next point for more\nelaboration\u2026\n3) Why wasn\u2019t Dark Knight nominated for Best Picture or Best Director? It was both critically and commercially successful, making over $1\nbillion worldwide. Surely that was the\nbest film of the year???\n4) Watching the show in its entirety makes you see that the whole\nAcademy Awards is an old boys\u2019 club.\nThey all know each other, they are all\nfriends. It was almost as if they were\nindoctrinating the cast and crew of\nSlumdog Millionaire into their gang\nas they won. No wonder it is hard to\nget into showbiz! I\u2019m sure the camaraderie is good once you are in \u2013 but\nhow can you break into such a hardened clique in the first place?\nSo in conclusion: Well done to England: winning Best Film, Best Documentary, Best Director and Best Actress is pretty impressive. Finally we\nare getting recognised for our talent!\nMy final thoughts are to give you\nsome advice. Next year when the\nAcademy Awards are on: go to sleep,\nwake up in the morning and read the\nlist of Oscar winners. There is no\npoint staying up and watching the\nceremony. It was way too long and, at\ntimes, boring, tedious and embarrass-ing. Yes there were some incredible\nhighlights like Beyonce shaking her\nstuff and Whoopi Goldberg making a\nbrief appearance but if you feel compelled to, watch the highlights on You\nTube: it is easier and quicker. That\nsaid, I can\u2019t help but feel a sense of\npride in myself for managing to watch\nit all\u2026 I did get really engrossed in it,\nbut mainly because I was anxiously\nwaiting for over 2 and a half hours for\nthem to announce whether Kate had\nwon or not!! If it is this bad for a random member of the public, can you\nimagine waiting that long if you were\nnominated??\nWill I stay up to watch the Oscars\nnext year? Only if I am invited to the\nceremony itself. And who knows: it\ncould happen! And the winner is\u2026\nme! Wow, I guess staying up that late\nreally does make you delusional!\nSixth time was the charm for Kate\nDanny Boyle deserves an Oscar just for being such a great person\nA.R. Rahman went home with\ntwo golden guys. Some night, eh?\nUnsurprisingly Ledger won Best Supporting Actor posthumously. Just\na pity the Dark Knight was largely ignored on the night.\nPenn used his on-air time to\nadvocate gay rights\ncars would begin, so I switched to Sky\nMovies Premiere and was greeted by\nClaudia Winkleman and other fairly\nwell-known guests (one of them was\nthe hilarious Danny Wallace). They\nchatted for a good half an hour and I\nwas less then impressed. I kept checking the clock. Why had the Oscars not\nbegun? Why were they dragging this\nout for as long as possible? Why was\nI not in bed instead?? I just wanted to\nsee Kate Winslet finally win for Best\nActress!!\ndiverse and any concept of socialisa-tion seems foreign to him. Moreover,\nhe has a very strained relationship with\nhis sons, which basically means that\nhe spends his days pretty much alone.\nEverything changes, however, once\nWalt defends the son of his neighbours\nfrom a street gang and a process of \u201crehumanisation\u201d seems to occur.\nThe reason why Eastwood\u2019s character\nis so likable, despite his diminished social skills, is that he is an embodiment\nof all the things we so dearly yearn to\nsee in recluse heroes: he seems obnoxious but actually isn\u2019t, he catches on\nfast, he always knows what the right\nthing to do is and he is able to come\nout on top \u2013 in a manner of speak-ing. There\u2019s something special about\nbeing blunt and always being correct\nabout things \u2013 because that\u2019s the only\ncircumstances which excuse such antisocial behaviour.\nWhat ruins part of the experience in\nGran Torino is the generally mediocre\nacting around Eastwood and particularly that of Bee Vang , who portrays\nThao, the boy being bullied. Several relevant scenes get torn to shreds by the\nunconvincing performance Vang delivers but luckily one can bear these with\na little courage and determination.\nIn the end, Gran Torino looks like a\nfairy-tale of a story: a nice, old fashioned feel-good movie, filled with\nhealthy laughs and divine justice. However it is fairly simplistic and it lacks\nthe depth of other Eastwood movies,\nwhich means that unless you grow to\nlike Walt Kowalski, this viewing experience will turn out to be less than\nrewarding.\nIt seems like Eastwood can\u2019t leave drama alone\nGran Torino HHHKK\nDirector:Clint Eastwood\nWriter: Nick Schenk & Dave\nJohannson\nCast: Clint Eastwood\nBee vang\nStefan Carpanu\nIn his latest feature \u2013 Gran Torino \u2013 the famous cowboy boldly takes on the issue of racism.\nClint Eastwood without a gun \u2013 now that would be a sight, but this is nothing we haven\u2019t seen before.\nThis week we have three DVD copies of Asylum to give away.\nAsylum is a terrifying tale of a\ngroup of undergraduate university\nstudents discovering that their dormitory was formerly an experimental mental health institution, which\nsoon reawakens their own buried\npersonal traumas.\nThis disturbing horror film will\nbe just the thing to watch from behind the sofa while ignoring Trick\nor Treaters on Halloween night.\nIf you would like to win Asylum\njust in time for Halloween, then all\nyou have to do is answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the serial killer in the Halloween\nmovies?\nCompetition\nBest Motion Picture\nof the year\nThe Six Prime Winners\nBest Performance by\nan Actor in a Leading\nrole\nBest Performance by\nan Actress in a Leading\nrole\nBest Performance by\nan Actress in a Supporting role\nBest Achievement in\nDirecting\nBest Performance by\nan Actor in a Supporting role\nChristian Colson for\nSlumdog Millionaire\nSean Penn for\nMilk\nKate Winslet for\nThe Reader\nPenelope Cruz for\nVicky, Cristina,\nBarcelona\nHeath Ledger for\nThe Dark Knight\nDanny Boyle for\nSlumdog Millionaire\n\n"

WTF?!? corner!!1!\nYes, this was a real piece of course work from Imperial College mechanical engineering department... clap clap\n33\nfelix\nFriday 27 February 2009\nOh RSM, is wonderful...\nFrom the off it was apparent that\nCamborne were going to be extremely\ndominant in the pack, with a no8 who\nwas definitely over 35 and balding (due\nto his age, not because he was fucking\nhis mum as someone yelled over the\nmegaphone). Whilst their team had\nregularly played against other malformed Cornish teams who had taken\ntoo many steroids in their spare time\nat school. As a result Camborne were\ncausing havoc in the scrums and were\ngenerally being disruptive enough to\nstop the RSM back line from making\nany real gains, however this did not\nstop the Adam Foley and Alex Johnstone from capitalising from any of\ntheir mistakes but they were sadly not\nable to convert any of these attempts\ninto points. As the game went on the\nRoyal Miners decided that it would be\nextremely unfair to hold onto the ball\nall the time and saw fit to give away\nmultiple penalties to Camborne, which\nresulted in them going deep in to\nRSM\u2019s territory and finally culminated\nin an unimaginative converted penalty\ntaking the Mohawk wearing (seriously,\nMohawks were never in fashion. Why\nbring them back for a match that you\nare unlikely to win?) Camborne miners\ninto the lead 3-0.\nEven after CSM took the first points\nof the match the Royal Miners were\nstill in neutral mode, not really playing their game plan and just putting\nin some brutal tackles to make sure\nno more points were scored. With the\ngame still being played in the middle of\nthe pitch and with no side really taking control, Tim Chalke decided to\nhave a spirited run at their winger to\nshow how much of a man he was. He\nsubsequently proved his manliness by\nhaving his cheekbone fracture in multiple places as he was brought down\nbut this did not stop him from making\nit to the union later in the evening! Half\ntime arrived quickly after a dirty CSM\nplayer was yellow carded for dangerous play. Stern words were had during\nthe team talk about playing to our po-tential. Bobby Goulding was particularly irate at the lack of action he had\nin the match and was clearly baying for\nthe blood of a Camborne miner. First\nblood against CSM was to be drawn\npretty soon\u2026\nIt was almost as if a new invigorated\nRSM team stepped foot on the pitch\nin the second half, with every player\nwanting victory and wanting to score\nduring the initial 8 minutes when CSM\nhad 14 players due to their scrum half\nbeing sin binned at the end of the 1st\nhalf. The forwards were finally securing ball and recycling it, providing a\nplatform for the backs to work from,\nwhich Lluis Guasch and Adam Foley well and truly used with some well\ntimed switches and interplay causing\nthe Camborne backline to breakdown\nand exposing a huge overlap on the\nblindside. At an instant the entire team\nhad realised this and the ball was rapidly passed through the hands to Max\nJoachim who smashed over the line in\nthe corner for the first try of the match\nto the delight of the RSM crowd and\nwas then majestically converted by\nAlex Johnstone.\nRSM continued their domination\nover Camborne by staying well and\nfirmly camped in their half and it wasn\u2019t\nlong until the backs broke through the\nContinued from back page\nCSM defence again with Adam Foley\nfinding a sweet and sexy gap that he\nthought he should slip into. This once\nagain started another round of megaphone chants from the Royal Miner\u2019s\ncrowd and a brief pitch invasion.\nTime was running out for Camborne; their lack of physical fitness was\nreally starting to show and they were\nlooking exhausted, unimaginative and\nclearly dejected after watching some\nprofessional champagne rugby from\nRSM. Their players started going down\nlike flies, all with cries of the RSM team\nwere being overly aggressive (clearly\nthey had never played in a Bottle Match\nbefore). However to their credit after\na complete lapse in the Royal Miner\u2019s\ndefence, Camborne capitalised on a 5\nperson blindside overlap by making a\nrapid break and scored a dubious try\nin the corner even though the majority\nof supporters saw the winger drop the\nball as he went over the try line.\nAfter this brief example of skill, it\nseemed that CSM had nothing left to\nshow and were back in their half fending off the continuous RSM onslaught,\nwhich was sadly ended by the referees\nwhistle to finish the game. Upon the final whistle the Royal School of Mines\ncrowd burst into pure pandemonium,\ninvading the pitch and celebrating with\nevery player that had put their body on\nthe line to defend the glorious bottle\nfor another year!\nThe winning team celebrating with The Bottle after the match\nCentre Adam Foley breaking a tackle against Cambourne\nphoto\nby\nJovan\nnedic\nphoto by Jovan nedic\nFootball men\u2019s\nfirsts gain revenge\nover Roehampton\nin BUCS\nThe previous fixture in BUCS 3A between these two resulted in a 3-1 win\nfor Roehampton and with the sides\nplaced lowly in the league, a win was\nimperative for both.\nThe game took on a similar characteristic to the previous encounter, with\nboth sides testing each other on the\nbreak, but Imperial started the brighter of the two and the reward came after\nthe fifteen minute mark as they took\ncontrol of a set piece. Cameron Smith\ndelivered the ball and captain Michael\nDonovan headed home convincingly\nto put the home side up.\nRoehampton responded immediately with glimpses of good football, but it\nwas evident they weren\u2019t in full stride\nas Imperial punished slack defending down the left channel. Will Swain\nMichael Donovan\ntouched the ball past the Roehampton\nfull back, reached the by-line and cut\nback for Dion Benincasa to slot home\ncalmly from 6 yards. The half finished\nwith Imperial 2-0 up, but Roes in the\nascendency. The best chance coming from a free kick, that emphatically\nstruck the cross bar only for the Imperial keeper to snatch the rebound.\nThe second half continued in a similar vein to the first, with Roes pressing,\nbut Imperial comfortable in defence.\nHowever, calamitous defending on\na massive scale was to blame as Roes\nwere gifted a route back into the game\nwith half an hour left.\nImperial failed to clear on numerous\noccasions and the centre midfielder\ntook his chance to drive the ball home\nfrom the edge of the box. 2-1 became\n3-1 with a strike, from Imperial midfielder Cameron Smith, which the\nkeeper will be disappointed with.\nDrama arrived late on with an error\nfrom the Imperial keeper that gifted a\ngoal to Roehampton but the game petered out leaving Imperial looking up,\nand Roes rooted to the bottom of the\nleague.\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 3\nRoehampton Men\u2019s 1sts 2\nICSM women dominate UH Head\nA few weeks ago ICSM Boat Club added three gold medals to their collection\nat the UH Winter Sprints in January,\nand then, on the beautiful afternoon of\nSaturday 21st February, once again the\nclub did not fail to impress as the ladies\nwon every women\u2019s division, bringing\nhome a total of three victories.\nFollowing a bitter sweet result at the\nUH Sprints, where the women\u2019s 1st\nVIII sprinted their way into the final\nbut sadly narrowly lost to RUMS BC,\nthe women turned up to the UL Boathouse in Chiswick with the single aim\nof regaining headship. The race was a\ngruelling experience our cox screaming\nmotivational words of encouragement,\nreminding us to breathe in a futile attempt to ease the pain as we sprinted\nour way from Richmond to the finish\nat the UL Boathouse. Despite pulling\naway from GKT, nearly overtaking St.\nGeorge\u2019s and knowing that none of us\ncould have given any more, how we did\nin relation to RUMS was far too close\nto call.\nThe women\u2019s 2nd VIII, having won\nmedals at the UH Winter Sprints, were\nalso down with a point to prove, though\nthey too knew it would not be without\na fight. Injuries, academic commitments and countless last minute problems plagued the 2nd VIII, meaning\nthat once again they had to rely on a\nnovice rower to complete their crew,\nwhich was put together at the last\nminute. The race was a challenge for\nall, but nine smiling, albeit tired, faces\ntold us that whatever the final result, it\nwas a good race.\nPerhaps the biggest pressure, how-ever, was felt by the Novice Girls, who\nhad yet to experience how it feels to\nlose a race. Having only started rowing\nin October, and already two UH medals under their belts after their amazing\nperformance at the Novice Sprints in\nNovember and the UH Winter Sprints,\nthis race would be unlike any other\nthey\u2019d ever done. After weeks of training and a level of commitment to rival\nthe seniors\u2019, the race plan discussed at\nthe carbo-loading session the night be-fore, over limitless bowls of pasta, was\nput into practice. Having overtaken the\ncrew they started behind within the\nfirst two minutes, they raced their way\nto UL, spurred on by the thought of\nmore \u201cshiny, shiny medals\u201d, and came\noff the water looking exhausted but\nsatisfied.\nThe men\u2019s division followed later in\nthe afternoon, where all crews were\nfaced with stiff competition from the\nhigh number of entries, and invitational crews in all categories including\nUCL and LSE. The Men\u2019s 1st VIII, who\nstarted at the head position, were desperate to keep up the momentum after\ntheir excellent win at the UH Winter\nSprints, and looked strong and determined as they rowed under Kew Road\nbridge, encouraged by chants from the\nICSM supporters. The Men\u2019s 2nd VIII\nwere also an example of force as they\nintimidated the surrounding crews.\nAfter their performance at the UH\nSprints, where despite having been\nplaced best UH crew, they lost to UCL\nNovices after a tough fight in the final,\nthe Novice Boys were determined to\nclaim back the gold medal they won\nat the UH Novice Sprints, where they\ntook the rest of the UH clubs by storm.\nBoth Novice Boys crews flew strongly\nunder Kew Road Bridge, much to the\npleasure of their Captain, Vin Nadesaligam, who cheered from the bridge,\nalong with the rest of the ICSM sup-port, which consisted not only of boat\nclub members but also other friends,\nparents, brothers, sisters, making us\nby far the best supported club on the\nbridge!\nThe results were announced at the\nannual UH Dinner, once again held\nat Tiger Tiger. A good evening turned\ninto a great one as it was announced\nthat the women of ICSM had won the\nNovice, Intermediate and Senior cate-gory, entirely dominating the women\u2019s\nraces. Looks of surprise, exhilaration\nand disbelief spread across everyone\u2019s\nfaces \u2013 rowers, coxes and coaches utterly overjoyed at all their efforts finally paying off in what felt like one of the\nproudest moments the ICSM Women\u2019s\nSquad had ever had the privilege of\nexperiencing. It got even better as the\nmen did us proud, coming second in\nthe Intermediate and Novice categories despite fierce competition from\nthe numerous other clubs entered.\nThe real partying had only just begun\nas everyone drank and danced into the\nnight, forgetting for a while that despite our victories, we will inevitably be\nback in our boats, training hard to stay\nahead of the UH clubs, sooner than\nyou can say \u201cTHREE MORE GOLD\nMEDALS!\u201d\nOla Markiewicz\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\n\n"

Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nLearning about the opposite sex\nAfter their very successful survey on what the opposite sex really wants, Every Nation Christian present the\ndebate that complemented it. As before, Tosin Ajayi tells us all\n29\nFriday 27 February 2009 felix\nA\ncouple of weeks ago, the\nobservant amongst you\nwould have noticed this\nposter all over campus,\nthe fortunate would have\nanswered a survey about the opposite\nsex relating to the poster, and the really\nswitched on would have seen the results of the 2009 Opposite Sex survey\nin felix two issues ago.\nBut the truly, divinely, blessed attended the event it all centred about.\nUnderstanding The Opposite Sex 2009\nin the Elec Eng foyer. With the Elec\nEng Caf\u00e9 transformed (well, this time\nthe food was free), the evening kicked\noff with the results of the survey presented in a Family Fortunes (check\nYouTube if that makes no sense) style.\nIn an attempt to \u2018decide once and for\nall\u2019 which sex understands more about\nthe other, a team of four girls took\nturns guessing what were the top five\nanswers which guys gave to the survey\nquestions.\nTheir opponents were a group of four\nguys guessing answers to the reverse\nquestions, with 10 points awarded for\nthe top answer, 8 for the next, and so\non.\nThe girls\u2019 team captain Lakshmi\nSreenivasan had assembled a crack\nsquad that promptly proceeded to\nromp through the first question \u201cWhat\ndo men look for in women?\u201d\u2013 getting\nfour out of five questions right.\nThe men were an altogether less\ncohesive unit; only guessing the top\none and the bottom two answers right\nwhen asked \u201cWhat do women look for\nin men?\u201d Team captain James Greenhalgh also took to arguing with other\nteam members and openly berated\none, proclaiming \u201cThey don\u2019t want\nthat!?\u201d when a team member suggested\n\u2018Commitment\u2019 as an answer.\nThis was a trend that repeated itself throughout the questions with\nthe men rapidly falling behind. Due to\nsome technical glitches, during which\nthe word \u2018Boobs\u2019 randomly popped\nup on the screen as an answer to the\nquestion \u201cWhat do women think men\nlook for?\u201d Some answers were revealed\nbefore the women had time to guess\nand although this wasn\u2019t their fault,\nthe ladies lost a couple of guesses, giving the men an ever-so-slim chance\nof catching up. One which the men\ndidn\u2019t really grab until the final ques-tions; \u201cWhat is the most important element to a successful relationship?\u201d and\n\u201cWhich one thing can most jeopardise\na relationship?\u201d when they hit on the\nnot immediately obvious yet ingenious\nploy of giving the exact same answers\nas the women did, who had answered\nbefore them.\n50 points were up for grabs in each\ncategory for the most random answer\ngiven for each question, but with answers such as \u201cSomeone with handcuffs\u201d, \u201cSomeone just as messed up as\nthey are\u201d and \u201cWhen you tell lies, make\nthem believable\u201d. It\u2019s perhaps no surprise that both teams failed to get even\none of these bonus answers.\nIn the end, the ladies ran out comfortable 80 \u2013 72 winners. A win that\nwould have been a lot more emphatic\nwithout the aforementioned points-robbing technical glitches.\nThe floor was then handed to Wolfgang (Wolfi) Eckleben, a Pastor of\nEvery Nation Church London, a man\nwho spent 5 years at university (a\n5-year course he assures us), and has\nbeen successfully married for 18 years.\nHe started off by asking the audience\nto guess whether certain objects were\nmale or female before revealing what\nthe answer was and why (e.g. Computer \u2013 male: in order to get their atten-tion, you have to turn them on).\nThis being a Christian run event, the\nbible was whipped out, with one of his\nopening gambits being Matthew 19:\n4-6 focussing on the phrase \u201c\u2026 at the\nbeginning God made them male and\nfemale\u2026\u201d\nHis main point here was that as men\nand women, we are obviously different\nand not only that but also God created\nus that way. After warning everybody\nthat what he was about to talk about\nwere generalisations, he went on to\noutline some of the ways in which we\nare different and some of the problems\nthat come from that, this included interviewing a married couple, Greg and\nSuzanne Albrecht, who had been married a year, after only knowing each\nother a year, cue surprised gasp from\naudience.\nMost of what they said seemed to\nback up Wolfi\u2019s earlier quote \u2013 \u201cThere\nare two times in life men and women\ndon\u2019t understand each other: before\nmarriage and after marriage\u201d. However,\nwhen asked what they\u2019d learnt about\nthe opposite sex that they\u2019d share with\nothers, Greg said: \u201cSometimes, the issue is less important than the relation-ship. If you have to, pick your time to\naddress it carefully. No use spoiling a\ngood evening over nothing\u201d while Suzanne said: \u201cRespect. Men need women to show them respect\u201d.\nWolfi took over again and proceeded\nto let women in on the ways men are\ndifferent, and from his experience,\nvice versa. He started by talking about\nthe way we think. Whilst it would be\nhard to dispute his assertion that men\nare compartmentalised creatures who\ndeal with one thing at a time, prefer\nto bottle emotions up until they make\nsense or subside and can easily divorce\nwork-life from home-life while women\nare global creatures who can superhu-manly deal with many things at a time,\nbring emotions into the marketplace\nand for whom if something is wrong,\nEVERYTHING is wrong; his tongue in\ncheek (surely!) suggestion that this was\ndue to testosterone disconnecting the\ntwo halves of the male brain drew the\nloudest heckles of the night, with cries\nlike \u201cReferences!\u201d ringing out. Mainly\nfrom the men though.\nOf particular delight was his plea to\neach sex to realise how the other sex\ngets sexually turned on. Men by sight,\nwomen by atmosphere. \u201cGuys\u201d, he said,\n\u201cif you need a girl\u2019s help with some calculus problem, and you ask her to meet\nyou at some low-lit Italian restaurant\nwith a guy playing the violin, you are\nsending a message.\u201d\n\u201cGirls, if you invite a guy for a platonic meal at McDonald\u2019s and show up\nin a miniskirt with a slit all the way up\nthe thigh and a plunging neckline, you\nmight just be there for a chat, but he\u2019s\nhearing something different\u201d.\n\u201cBe aware of this, and try to only\nsend a message you want to. A lot of\nhurt will be avoided that way.\u201d\nFurther comparisons made were the\ndifferences in shopping styles, communication (Men: headlines, Women:\ndetails) and crisis management.\nOn crisis management, he stated that\nmen like to take a problem away, hide\nand conquer it.

For\nmost people under\nthirty, we are reminded of a fluffy period where you\ncould hear about the Domino theory,\nthe Vietnam War, communes and hungry peasants... In short, some of the\nremains of a disaster. But Communism\nin Russia spurred much more than just\ndisaster. In fact, the socio-political\nsetting of Bolshevik Revolution triggered massive artistic movements in\nthe late 1910s, which were dominated\nby Constructivism. Of this movement,\ntwo artists have been glorified for their\ninventive works: Liubov Popova and\nAleksandr Rodchenko. Both artists are\nnow being honoured at the Tate Modern until the 25th of May.\nA concept coined in 1919, Constructivism represents a rejection of the \u201cart\nfor art\u2019s sake\u201d philosophy and thrives\nto create art that would be meaningful\nand multidimensional, questioning its\nfundamental properties and its place\nin society. In other words, art should\nbe like a social construction; purposeful and made for the masses. Artistically, it translates into an interesting\nprogression, like responding arguments in a discussion. The first phase\nof the movement was dominated by\npainting. Displaying sometimes mini-malist, sometimes intricate, works of\ngeometrical shapes and rays, the artists played mostly with colors and tex-tures, developing graphic abstraction.\nTo the unused eye, the pieces could all\nfeel alike at first sight\u2026 However, after\ntwo or three rooms, the differences in\nstyle between Popova and Rodchenko\ncan readily be observed, and one can\nappreciate the ongoing evolution in\ntechniques that are used. It has to be\nsaid that Constructivism was not only\na form of artistic expression; it was the\nembodiment of a whole societal phi-losophy, taking the form of a debate,\na discussion, an introspection. An utterly adequate reflection of the sociopolitical context in which Russia was;\nwhere one searched for the meaning of\nart, the other explored the meaning of\nsocieties. In itself, the diagnostic was\nunanimous: both should be produc-tive, organised and planned. This is\nreflected in the perfect lines and circles pictured in paintings and sculp-tures, defined in precision by ruler and\ncompass.\nIn the 1920s, Rodchenko and Popova\nstarted exploring sculpture, moving\naway from plane and platonic painting and forward to representations in\n\u201creal space\u201d. Another parallel to Communism, Constructivists believed art\nwas to be made collectively and for the\ncollectivities; it therefore regrouped\nmany artists working in collaboration\nfor most of the movement\u2019s preponderance in Russian arts.\nAlong these lines, the exhibition\npresents Popova, Rodchenko and their\nfriends\u2019 respective works as painters\nand sculptors, as they develop following the progression of Communism.\nWith Lenin\u2019s New Economic Policy in\nthe 1920s, which allowed private enterprise to operate on a limited scale,\nRodchenko, Popova and their entire\ncircle turned to be productive for society by adapting their art to be more\nuseful to everyday life. They therefore became architects, furniture and\nfashion designers, advertisers, theatre\ndirectors and more. Part of their time\nwas occupied by orders from the Soviet government for propaganda posters and political education campaigns.\nWhile their pieces from the period\ndemonstrate more flexibility, and allowed characters and figures to be\nrepresented, it still depicted the same\npurely mechanic and engineered style.\nOne can however appreciate much of\nthe new uses they found for their art.\nIn a very interesting outcome, Popova\u2019s\nnumerous creations for the State Cotton-Printing Factory in Moscow influenced directly the daily lives of women\nin Russia, as they bought the fabric to\nmake their dresses and started an entirely new fashion. Constructivism is\nalso noticeable in that it was one of the\nfirst periods when women were equally\nvalued and respected in arts than men,\nthanks to Communists\u2019 notion of the\nequality of sexes.\nConstructivism was ephemeral but\nintense. As Stalin took power in late\n1920s, Constructivism had lost ground\nby the 1930s to Socialist, or Heroic\nRealism, which glorified workers and\npeasants in illusionary paintings and\ngrandiose sculptures. However, Constructivism inspired numerous others than just our Bolshevik brothers\nin their beginnings; it was the basis of\nthe eponymous movement that later\nspread through Europe and America in\nthe \u201830s and \u201840s, and is still an important figure in everyday designs.\nSeemingly a forgotten ancestor of today\u2019s abstract and contemporary styles,\nConstructivism has proven through\nthe Tate\u2019s exhibition to be more than\ninteresting, it is enquiring. The dreary\nselection of paintings showed at first\nsomehow explodes in an exponential\nnumber of techniques and variations,\nthat makes this exhibition a fast-paced\nand continuous discovery. Great work\nTate, it is always admirable to see what\ngeniuses can do out of a bunch of\nsquares and circles!\nShowing at the Tate Modern until\n17th May\nLyubov Popova, Construction 1920, Oil on canvas\nVarvara Stepanova, Dancing Forms on a white background, 1920.

A Maori sym-bol, the indigenous people of NZ believed that it guarantees its bearer safe\njourneys over land and water.\nSurely, something like folklore and\nsuperstition are way too irrational for\nan Imperial mind, like mine, to believe\nand rely upon?\nThat certainly was my mentality when, the evening before my flight\nback, the gore of a post- plane crash\nhospital scene flashed upon the family\nTV. My clutch on the pendant couldn\u2019t\nbe firmer throughout the night and\nduring the flight.\nAs you might have gathered, I made\nit back in one piece.\nAviation accidents have frequently\nmade it to our headlines, more so in\nrecent months than ever. Fresh out of\nthe news is the Amsterdam Schiphol\nCrash today (Weds 25 Feb), closely followed by the Buffalo crash two weeks\nago, a crash in Brazil and the Hudson\nRiver Incident in January. Which puts\nthe grand total of commercial accidents since the dawn of 2009 at four.\nI don\u2019t have a phobia for flying, in\nfact quite the contrary; yet these figures (and those I go through during my\nresearch) are enough to make my heart\nrace. I can\u2019t help but worry.\nFor the love of god, I don\u2019t want to die.\nNot yet.\nRight after Hudson River, an American friend made it clear on Facebook\nthat she is to never travel on a plane\never again. After being accused \u2013 by\nme \u2013 for scaremongering she proceeded to exclaim that \u201ca plane and some\ngeese got into a fight, and the geese\nwon\u201d. However childish this might\nsound (she is a research assistant at the\nUniversity of Auckland, in fact), the\nstatement has a certain degree of logic\nin it. It carries the grandiose sentiment\none gets from staring into the face of\ndeath. This is the harsh, but remote,\nreality. The geese did get into a \u2018fight\u2019\nwith the aircraft, and they did bring it\ndown. Easy as.\nBut please, don\u2019t let this put you off\nflying. The last thing I want (as travel\neditor) is to see my readers rot on this\nisland. Here are reasons why there is\nabsolutely nothing to fear about.\nWhacking out the clich\u00e9, here is a statistical fact: you are more likely to die\nin a car accident than in a plane crash.\nMore the apparent when you compare\nthe probability of fatality due to an aviation accident (one in 11 million) to that\ndue to an automobile accident (one in\n5000). The Times magazine had kindly\npointed out, in 2006, that \u201cmore than\n500 times as many people die on U.S.\nroads as in airline accidents\u201d.\nFlying is becoming progressively\nsafer. Other than the events of 9/11,\naviation technology of the 21st century\nhas reduced accidents and casualties to\nthe bare minimum. The high standards\nof training for pilots meant tragedies\ndeveloped into tales of survival and\nheroism \u2013 look no further than Hudson River and the stray landing of BA\nFlight 38 (Jan 2008). Out of the four\naccidents of 2009, two had all or most\nof the passengers walking out of the\naircraft after a crash landing, thanks to\nthe composure and dexterity of the pi-lots. Stick to the news and you will find\nproof to my claims.\nSpeaking about media coverage, it\nmust be blamed for causing our fear\nof flight. The media is responsible for\noverdramatising airplane disasters as a\nway to increase their financial gains \u2013\nhow else could they get our attention?\nIn fact, it is this fear they had created\nthat they are now exploiting to manipulate their readership.\nWe take risks in everyday situations.\nJust as choking on food, keeping a pet\ndog, taking a bath, even getting out of\nbed \u2013 all of which, by the way, have a\nhigher death rate than flying \u2013 present a death threat, travelling by flight\ndoes involve some level of risk. So have\nfaith in modern aeronautics, and especially in our pilots. Have a pleasant\nflight. Forget about the engine failures,\nthe fuel starvations. And I am sure the\ngeese can\u2019t win every day.\nMinced goose for dinner anyone?\nWieliczka Salt Mine\nDylan Lowe went underground and licked the wall - it\u2019s salty\nI\nknew someone who had refused\nto visit Poland because of his hatred for Polish immigrants. How\npathetic. Not only is this racist\nattitude totally unacceptable, he\nis also missing out big time.\nTo forsake a country as culturally\nand architecturally enriched as Poland\nis utter idiocy. Which brings me to\nmy very own Polish experience. With\na tight schedule, Warsaw, a city still\nstaggering away from the obliteration\nof WWII and subsequent Soviet rule,\nwas left out of the itinerary. Instead we\nheaded towards Krakow, the Medieval\nPolish capital and home to Poland\u2019s\nfinest of architecture.\nCity aside, the greatest testimony of\nthe Polish\u2019s constructional genius lies\nin Wieliczka, ten kilometres southeast\nof Krakow Central, in the form of a salt\nmine.\nA salt mine? Care to say that again?\nActive until 1996, the Wieliczka salt\nmine had been operating for over nine\ncenturies. It is hard to imagine how a\ndirt-cheap produce that is salt was the\nmedieval equivalent of oil; harder still\nis that the mine is now a World Heritage site and major tourist attraction.\nLoitering on the surface, somewhere\nwithin the township of Wieliczka, I had\nmy doubts. I could almost smell a tourist trap underneath my feet.\nUpon entry, through a museum-like complex, the flight of stairs was\nwhat separated me from the moment\nof truth. That was all four hundred of\nthose cursed steps, though it was more\nlike a thousand.\nAccuse me of touristic ignorance\nhere, but I couldn\u2019t honestly see the\nmerits of a narrow tunnel littered\nwith archaic mining gear. But then our\nguide wasn\u2019t even in the slightest undermined by our lack of interest. He\nwas better aware that the boredom was\na mere prelude to what is to come.\nSo when the winches and lumber\nvanished, and their replacements ap-peared, the Pole had won back our\ngusto. There were caverns. And pil-lars. And pavements. And sculptures.\nAnd statues. All cleaved out of rock\nsalt. The vaults were so hectic with\nthe spectacles that, two years on, the\nmemory of my visit has gone fuzzy. But\nI can still remember recognising the\nfaces preserved in the halite, the joy of\nfinding and naming replicates of artwork found, perhaps, in the Louvre. Oh\nyeah, and not resisting the invitation to\nlick the walls \u2013 I spent the reminder of\nthe tour craving for water.\nYou would think the dextrous pairs of\nhands that carved out the masterpieces\n\u2013 which includes, by the way, a relief of\nDa Vinci\u2019s The Last Supper \u2013 belonged\nto true maestros of art. You would be\nwrong. All it took were generations of\nordinary, unnamed salt miners, and\ntheir endeavour to transform their\nworkplace and, indeed, homes, into a\nsanctuary of craftsmanship.\nTake the leap\n\u201cBungee jumping originated from\nthe Vanuatuan coming-of-age ritual.\nTribesmen, tied to their ankles with\nvines, would jump off wooden platforms to prove their courage. This\nritual, called Gkol, is performed in the\nPentecost Island of Vanuatu.\nInspired by the footage of the Gkol,\nmembers of the Oxford University\nDangerous Sport Club, attempted the\nfirst modern bungee jump in Bristol.\nThe man responsible for commer-cialising bungee jumping is A J Hackett, a New Zealander, who opened\nthe first commercial jump site on the\nKawarau Bridge in Queenstown, New\nZealand in 1988. The man himself per-And just as I thought I had had\nenough flattery for one day, we ambled\ninto the Chapel of St Kinga.\nThe chapel itself is nothing more\nthan a subterranean church garnished\nlavishly by religious sculptures and\nbas-relief. The chandeliers, which\nwere made almost entirely of purified salt, draped the chamber with a\nhumble glimmer. But the essence of\nthe location, the sheer scale of labour\nand history required to assemble such\nglamour \u2013 it has rendered me speechless even now.\nMaybe it was better expressed in\nsongs, since performing in this cavernous concert hall (as a chorister in\na school choir tour) had produced the\nmost beautiful acoustics I have ever\nheard in my fleeting career as a singer.\nThe Wieliczka salt mine represents\nwhat I love the most about travelling:\nto venture into a site with zero expec-tations, and to come out completely\nblown away. It is the discovery of\nthese hidden gems that makes the trip\nworthwhile.\nEven more fascinated still, I learnt\nthis: despite treading for three hours,\n90m below ground, I had seen less than\na meagre 1% of the entire salt mine,\nwhich consists of a 200km-long passage and 2040 caverns (of which I have\nvisited 20). And thanks to memories\nlike these, I am dying to go travelling\nagain. Still a month to go till Easter?\nDamn.\nThe Chapel of Saint Kinga\nformed many bungee stunts, which\ninclude jumping from Eiffel Tower in\n1987, from a helicopter at 380m, and\nfrom the Royal Gorge Bridge, the highest suspension bridge in the world.\nThe highest-recorded bungee jump\nwas performed by Andrew Salisbury in\n1991 (926m). The world\u2019s highest commercial bungee can be found in South\nAfrica, at a height of 216m.\u201d\n-Well done to Jumper for sending in a\nbrilliant account of bungy jumping.\nWant to tell us about your last holi-day?

Some biologists propose that\nsimilar forces play a role in animal be-haviour, especially in the distribution of\npayoff s between trading animals. Animal interactions such as sexual selec-tion, within-species cooperation and\nbetween species mutualism can all be\nseen as a trade between two classes of\ntraders. For example, males may offer\nfemales nuptial gifts in exchange for\ncopulations; territorial animals may\nallow subordinates to share their territory in exchange for help in raising\nthe territorial animal\u2019s off spring; and\naphids exchange sugary substance for\nprotection by ants. The exchange rate\nfor traded goods isn\u2019t fixed in these\nexamples: for example, aphids may\nsecrete more sugary substance when\nthe number of ants tending them is\nsmaller, so the exchange rates correlate\nto the availability of certain commodi-ties. The fewer ants there are the more\nthey get paid for their services. Another\nstriking example of a biological market\nis a marine cleaning station \u2013 a place\non the coral reef where fish or shrimp,\nknown as cleaners, live by eating parasites off their \u2018clients\u2019. Cleaning stations\nmanifest many of the features of a mar-ketplace: goods on off er are advertised;\nUS Cosmetology bans\ncleaner fish\nclients are chosen in order to maximise\nprofits; there is competition over the\nmembers of the rare class by the common class members; and supply and\ndemand of commodities determine\ntheir relative value.\nCleaners advertise their availability\nto clients by positioning themselves on\na visible place at the station (usually a\ncoral head). Good advertising is essential for attracting customers and cleaners advertise brilliantly: one can easily\nlocate a cleaner at long distances when\nsnorkelling/diving. Their bright colours contrast with the pale background\nof the cleaning station (for example,\nyellow brain corals) and they usually\nhave a horizontal stripe that also attracts clients. In a business interaction\ncommunication is an essential tool for\nsuccessful transactions. The communication between cleaners and clients has\nbeen evolving for a long time and consists of various components. I already\nmentioned colour signals that inform\nclients of cleaner\u2019s location and avail-ability. Behavioural communication\nis another component of the graceful\nchoreography of cleaning interactions.\nClients that visit the stations signal\ntheir willingness to indulge in cleaning\nby assuming trance-like states. They\nhover on their head or tail until the\ncleaner inspects them. These inspection bouts last from several seconds\nto a few minutes, during which the\ncleaner may remove ectoparasites from\nthe client\u2019s body surface, sometimes accompanied by the client giving a sudden jolt. These may indicate instances\nof the cleaner biting the client\u2019s tissues\nrather than removing the ectoparasites.\nSimilar body jerks by clients signal to\nthe cleaner that they are about to leave\nthe station, so if a cleaner is inside their\nmouth it has time to safely exit before\nthe client swims off. Clients have no intention of eating a good cleaner. Cleaners, for their part, communicate their\nbeneficial intention by dancing movements prior to and during the inspec-tion, and they may also provide tactile\nstimulation of the client with their fins.\nCleaning symbioses have been\nviewed as mutualistic selfless cooperation (a good one for Creationists), as\nan example of reciprocal altruism (I\u2019ll\nscratch your back if you scratch mine)\nand more recently as behavioural parasitism (this supposes that cleaners are\nparasites who exploit clients by eating their body surfaces whilst keeping them under tactile hypnosis). Th\ne most recent theoretical background\nto understanding cleaning symbioses\nhas been the biological market theory,\nwhere goods are seen as being exchanged between the cleaner and the\nclient. In light of this theory cleaning\ninter- actions provide an opportunity\nfor both cleaners and clients to cheat.\nCleaners can cheat by ingesting mucus\nand taking bites out of the client, which\nis damaging to the client\u2019s health and\nfitness; while the client can cheat, if\nit is a piscivore, by eating the cleaner.\nClients can also punish cleaners for not\ncooperating by chasing them, which\ncan be energetically costly for both\nparties. Imagine having to chase your\nhairdresser after they cut your ear: it is\nbeneficial for both you and them not to\nhave to resort to that kind of scenario.\nSimilarly, cleaners generally don\u2019t make\ntheir clients angry. Cleaners may even\napply pre-conflict management strategies to avoid being eaten.\nAlthough the piscivorous clients may\neat the cleaners they generally do not\ndo so. This fact has been exploited by\nsome other fish species that can mimic\ncleaner fish species in order to avoid\nbeing eaten by piscivores, while exploiting them as a food source (eating\ntheir mucus and fins). Using a similar\nstrategy, some human companies exploit designer labels or brands by making fake products and labels to fool the\nunwary customer into purchasing these\ninstead of the \u2018real thing\u2019. This imitation\ndevalues the original product, just as\nthe cleaner\u2019s \u2018reputation\u2019 is damaged\nin the eyes of the fooled client, who\ngets a bite instead of a cleaning and\ntouching session. An interesting possibility is that cleaner species that are\nmimicked by other fish species may\nbe eaten more often than cleaner species that are mimic-free. There is more\nselection pressure on clients not to eat\nmimic-free cleaners than there is to eat\nthe mimicked species since in the latter\ncase sometime they will eat the actual\nmimic and that would increase the client\u2019s fitness, rather than decrease it.\nSince clients are more numerous\nthan cleaners there are often queues in\nfront of the cleaning station. Larger and\nstronger fish attempt to chase the others away, but the cleaner has the final\nsay in who gets inspected, and when.\nAn interesting question that is still unanswered is what determines how attractive the client is to the cleaner. One\nreason might be that cleaners recognize\nclients\u2019 parasite load and choose those\nthat are most infected. But if cleaners\ncheat on clients by eating their mucus then they may well prefer to clean\nthose whose mucus is most nutritious.\nIn a sense such clients get ripped off as\nthey have to \u2018pay extra\u2019 to get cleaned if\nthe cleaners are also stripping them of\ntheir mucus. Although mucus has been\nfound in cleaners\u2019 stomachs it may well\nbe that it was ingested accidentally\nalong with the parasites that were the\nprimary target for the cleaners.\nCleaners have been shown to be able\nto recognize familiar clients; more spe-cifically, they can distinguish clients\nthat have access to only one cleaning\nstation from those that have access to\nseveral. Cleaner fish will inspect and\nclean those clients that have the option\nof visiting several cleaning stations (the\n\u2018floaters\u2019) rather than clients that only\nhave access to one (the \u2018residents\u2019).\nThe rationale be- hind this is obvious:\nclients that can visit other cleaning stations will do so if they are not satisfied\nwith the service provided at the current\nstation, whilst those that can- not visit\nother stations are restricted to their habitual station regardless of the quality of\nthe service. The cleaners actually spend\nmore time with the \u2018choosy\u2019 clients and\nperhaps even cheat them less; in any\ncase, choosy clients wait less time to be\ninspected by the cleaner when there is\na queue for the cleaner\u2019s services \u2013 it is\nalmost as if they have a VIP pass to the\ncleaning stations. Interestingly, clients\nhave been shown to remember which\ncleaning stations have provided them\nwith a quick and effective service and\nto return preferentially to them, while\nthey avoid the stations where they\nhad to wait for a long time, were not\ngiven enough attention, or where they\nhad been cheated previously. In effect,\nthere is pressure on cleaners to provide\nbetter service to choosy clients so that\nthey return to their station \u2013 a good\nbusiness with lots of clients is a matter\nof life or death for cleaner fish.\nFurthermore, cleaners seem to be\nable to recognize piscivorous clients\nas well as their satiation level. When\ncleaner fish approach their client they\nexhibit a dancing motion, and also\nsometimes touch them. The dance\ninforms the client that the cleaner is\nabout to inspect it. (This dancing swim\nresembles the flying motion of some\nbirds performing to attract males: it is\ninteresting to see how a similar behavioural signal evolved in the sea and in\nthe air for two different purposes.) The\nhungry piscivorous clients are touched\nmore often than the herbivores. The\nexplanation for this may be that cleaners are using a \u2018risk management strategy\u2019 whereby they remind the hungry\nclients that they are cleaning them\n\u201cThe dance\ninforms the\nclient that the\ncleaner is about\nto inspect it.\u201d\nMi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107\nScience Editor\nSimple designs that re-use sink, shower and bath water to flush the toilet could save gallons of water and\ncut down our water bills.\nNo more \u201cIf it\u2019s yellow, let it mellow\u201d! Meet the\nGrey Water Toilet System design\nFinally designers and engineers are\nasking the same question I was asking\nwhen I was 10 or so. Why on Earth do\nwe use fresh, drinking water to flush\nour toilets at a time when water shortages and pollution are on a constant\nrise?\nAlison Norcott, a student designer\nfrom Swinburne University of Technology, entered her \u201cThe Grey Water\nToilet System\u201d design into this year\u2019s\nAustralian Design Award competi-tion, and many eco blogs picked up on\nit, mainly commending such a system.\nShe explains how the system works:\n\u201cThe Grey Water Toilet System, designed specifically for apartment\nbuildings, helps conserve water by using shower water for flushing. The water is collected from the shower drain\nand pumped into an in-wall tank. To\navoid bacteria growth, the tank is discharged on a cyclic basis so that water isn\u2019t stored for over twenty four\nhours.\u201d\nShe goes on to explain, \u201cThe system has been specifically designed to\nfit within the wall cavity of an apartment building. There are currently no\nreal solutions for apartments regarding grey water systems, all cater to the\nhousehold market. Efficiency of the\nsystem and space minimisation have\nbeen key considerations during the\ndesign process.\u201d\nAnd the benefits of such a novel\ndesign are that \u201cThis system will save\nhundreds of litres of fresh drinking\nwater per person per week. There is\nno need to waste such a precious resource on an application like toilet\nflushing.\u201d Now if only we could get\nImperial to install this in all the student accommodation...\nUnfortunately, this design didn\u2019t\nmake it to the shortlist for 2009\nAwards. Nevertheless, similar commercial systems already exist and\nperhaps this design will raise people\u2019s\nawareness of such an easy way to cut\ndown on water wastage. One such\nsystem is the US based Aqus, \u201ca small\nscale greywater recycling system that\nuses treated water that is captured\nfrom the bathroom sink to flush the\ntoilet \u2013 and accomplish greywater recycling in the process.\u201d They estimate\nsavings of up to 6000 gallons of water\nand $30 a year per household.\nAnother such system is Canadian\nBrac\u2019s Greywatre Recycling System.\nThey say \u201cBrac systems can help you\nsave 35% to 40% on your annual water\nbill, and while saving money, you will\nalso help save the environment and\nprovide a better future for our children\nand their children to come. With this\namount of savings, your Brac Greywater Recycling System pays itself.\u201d So\nthere are no more excuses for flushing\ntoilets with drinking water.\nand that it is not worth eating them. It\nlooks as if cleaners provide dangerous\nclients with an especially good service,\nincluding more pleasure \u2013 imagine getting a massage with your car-wash just\nbecause you have a gun. The pleasure\nthat fish get out of tactile stimulation\nduring an inspection by the cleaner has\nbeen offered as an explanation as to\nwhy clients come to cleaning stations\nin the first place. This is supported by\nobservations of some clients posing\nin sea plumes, types of feathery soft\ncoral, even when there are no cleaning\nstations around \u2013 these fish seem to\nbe motivated by the enjoyment of the\nsensation itself rather than the cleaning\nbenefits of having their parasites re-moved. However, there is also evidence\nthat suggests that clients carrying more\nparasites seek cleaners sooner; this\nwould imply that they visit cleaning\nstations primarily due to the irritation\nthey receive from increased parasite\nloads.\nThe exact importance of cleaning stations to the ecological systems in which\nthey are found is still unknown. Some\nCosmetology boards in several US\nstates, including Florida, have banned\nuse of fish in spas and cosmetic salons.\nThe tiny fish, originally found in Turkey, are popular in Asia. The fish nibble on dead skin and provide customers with hydromassage that is thought\nto be beneficial for psychological disorders and various skin diseases, most\nnotably psoriasis.\nThe ban comes before the fish treatment is even available in these states.\nBoards have highlighted the fact that it\nis difficult to disinfect pools with live\nCan fish teach us economics?\nexperiments that have removed cleaning stations from a reef have reported\nemigration of other fish species and\nhigher infection rates of the few species that have stayed, but others have\nreported no change in fish biodiversity\nor health. So the effects of cleaning stations on fish biodiversity are still not\nfully understood, but there is a possibility that they play an important role in\nkeeping reef fish populations healthy.\nThe fact that cleaning symbioses have\nevolved convergently several times suggests their importance to the ecosys-tems. Convergent evolution is when the\nsame adaptations to similar habitats or\nsituations have evolved independently\nin more than one type of organism. A\ncommon example of this is the similar\naerodynamic shape of the shark (a fish),\ndolphin (a mammal) and penguin (a\nbird), which is thought to have evolved\nin response to their shared marine life-style. In any case, although we do not\nknow the exact importance of marine\ncleaning stations to the fish biodiversity\nand health of coral reef communities,\nthe benefits of cleaners to farmed fish\nhave been demonstrated and so an understanding of cleaner-client interactions have both theoretical and practical (economical/aqua-cultural) value.\nSo next time you go to the market\nplace, perhaps the farmer\u2019s market on\nBute Street or Borough Market and\nyou attempt to get the best price for the\ngoods you purchase, think about the\nfascinating power of evolution that has\nresulted in biological markets where\nthe service-providers and clients exchange goods by the same rules we do,\nexcept that they implement these rules\nwithout the need for rational thought.\nOur free economy has reached similar\nsolutions to those reached by natural selection. This further illustrates\nwhy Darwin was influenced by Adam\nSmith\u2019s laissez-faire approach to econ-omy. This raises some interesting ques-tions: how many features of human\nsociety are shaped by natural selection\nand our basic animal nature? And how\nmany problematic aspects of our society could be solved by examining the\nway natural selection has solved similar\nproblems in nature?\n\u201cThey have\na VIP pass to\nthe cleaning\nstations.\u201d\nMi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107\nScience Editor\nMi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107\nScience Editor\nfish in them. Use of pets and animals\nfor cosmetic purposes is also not allowed in the US.\nOther mention ethical issues: these\nfish do not naturally feed on human\nskin, they have to be starved to develop liking for humans as a food\nsource.\nThese \u2018doctor fish\u2019 or \u2018little dermatologists\u2019 come from two species Garra\nrufa and Cyprinion macrostomus. They\nare both used in spas in many coun-tries, including some of the US states.\n\u201cThis is a good treatment for everyone\nwho likes to have nice feet,\u201d John Ho.\nan owner of one such salon told CBC\nNews last year.\nIt is interesting that humans visit\nthese fish \u2018cleaning stations\u2019 for the\nsame reasons as wild fish: for both\npleasure and hygiene.\nMarine cleaning stations exist in\nmost oceans around the world where\nvarious species of cleaner fish and\nshrimp advertise their services and\nclean a variety of fish and even sea\nturtles.\nMany of the biological features of\nthese cleaning stations resemble human economic exchanges, the sort\nthat take place at trading places such\nas car wash stations and markets.\nOccasionally, there is even a credit\ncrunch...\nIC Radio\u2019s weekly science\nshow Ear on Science is looking\nfor scientists and PhD\nstudents to talk about their\nresearch.

I am not making a sarcastic\nslight on the terminally ill, I am being\nentirely genuine.\nShe is best known for being unre-markable. From one reality game show\nto the next, from big mouthed to bigot,\nshe has apparently done nothing of\nnote for her entire life. Yet she had at\none stage amassed a fortune of over\na million pounds- and for someone\nwithout a career or a company that\nis no mean feat. She has manipulated\nour collective consciousness in a way\nincomparable to anything save for perhaps the \u201cTriumph of the Will.\u201d From\nbeing universally hatred- so much so\nthat the Indian Government didn\u2019t\nwant her apologies- to universally pitied so much so that the Prime Minister\nhimself sends his condolences is un-precedented. I can\u2019t fathom why this\nis, aside from having the world\u2019s best\npublicist, but it seems I am being swept\nup in the consensus.\nFor most, death is a time you need\nalone. The stages of accepting death are\nfive, and none are particularly pleas-ant, and Goody will go through them\nlike every other person on this Earth.\nHowever when walking through the\nlobby of Charing Cross Hospital, in\nwhat was a surreal moment given the\nnumber of \u201cordinary\u201d people on the\nfloors above quietly suffering the same\nplight, her face was on every paper in\nthe shop. I was genuinely surprised to\nfind the billboard on Fulham Palace\nRoad wasn\u2019t featuring her. Instead of\ntime alone to grieve, she has sold her\nstory to the News of the World and\nbeen interviewed by, in my opinion, the\nmost sickening, bile-spouting excuse\nfor a journalist the world has ever seen:\nCarole Malone. You may remember her\nas the one who recently labelled Imperial College as \u201cbigoted half-wits\u201d in an\nargument a blind, toothless raccoon\ncould have ripped apart. She has sold\nthe rights to her wedding for over \u00a3700\n000, and the television rights for another \u00a3100 000 in a macabre spectacle that\nfollows a dying woman to the grave.\nOf course no-one really cares about\nthe atrocities going on around the\nworld, and the only reason people give\nmoney at comic relief is a mixture of\nguilt and wanting to see Noel Edmonds\ngunged. As Goody will know a million\ndeaths is but a mere statistic and she\ncan use this to make the readers of the\ntabloids her disciples in what may end\nup being a cult movement. She is getting the last laugh by cashing in on her\nown despair, but we should not put it\ndown to greed. She knows that she has\nlived by the sword, but as death faces\nher already she no longer has to fear\ndying by it, and is controlling her own\ndestiny.\nBut despite all of sheer revulsion this\nbehaviour could cause, I cannot fault\nher, for a number of reasons. Arguably\nshe brought this on herself by ignoring\na letter telling her to have abnormal\ncervical cells removed, and I suppose\n(even if subliminally) she is looking for\nsome cathartic remedy against society by milking it for everything it has\nto offer; we can\u2019t deny her a natural\npsychological response. And I\u2019m sure\nshe never had in mind the fact that\nher plight would cause participation in\nlifesaving cervical cancer screening to\nincrease by up to 21% in some areas-something that no amount of letters\nand television campaigns could ever\nachieve. Above all it is said that all of\nthe money she earns by prostituting\nherself to the media will support her\nsoon to be motherless children, perhaps maternal instinct at its best.\nThough none of these are really the\nreasons why I will quite happily abide\nby this abhorrent exploitation of terminal illness. I don\u2019t believe she is particularly brave or amazing- no more than\nthe million other cancer sufferers that\nare being treated. It is mainly because\nJade Goody may have realised, perhaps\nas we all will one day, that whatever\nlies in store after death is irrelevant.\nSo don\u2019t get caught up in the posters\naround College or on bendy buses arguing whether or not God exists and\nwhether to be happy- just be happy\nanyway. Because when it comes down\nto the final crunch, all you can do is to\nabide by the universal religion of Her\nMajesty\u2019s head and try and make a bit\nof cash.\nJaimie Henry takes inspiration from Jade Goody\nKawai Wong loves skinny walking mannequins\n\u201cAny muffin\ntop on the side\nwill distort the\nsilhouette of a\ndress which is\ntightly fitted at the\nwaist\u201d\nN\natural History Museum.\nLondon Fashion Week\nentrance. 20 women.\nSkinny, oriental, pretty,\nblack, white, tall, ugly,\nfat.

For these women\nwho actually looked like they have\nsome brain juice to think that Galliano\nmust have some unfound rage for fat\npeople. I offer far more sympathy for\nthem than to a dying Jade Goody.\nCatwalk dresses have complicated\nembroidery and intricate folds that just\nhave to be done by hand. These samples are not mass produced by lighting\nneedles in a factory. For a collection\nthat shows twice in a year, seamstresses have around 4 months to finish the\ntypical 40 pieces in a showcase. With\na piece which may cost up to 200 man\nhours to make, where do they find the\ntime to gather models A-Z to make\nspecific measurements?\nEven if dresses are specifically made\nfor models of varying sizes, what if\nthey drop out? A replacement who has\nthe same \u201cvaried height and shape\u201d\nis not easy to find. Does it mean the\ndress would have to be remade, or\nworse, discarded? Never forget a fashion show is to demonstrate a designer\u2019s\nvision on dresses. It is not a personal\ntailor show.\nAt the time of sewing, the dresses\nwere made using a standard set of\nmeasurementswithoutknowingwhose\nbody they may eventually fall onto. If a\ncasting manager books models from\nsize 6-16. He is putting his head on the\nchopping board. In fact, only 2 weeks\nprior to the show the seamstresses\nstart to minor tweak the fittings for\nspecific models.\nDesigners ideally want walking dummies on catwalks. Someone who looks\nbland and faceless enough to not distract the audience from his creation.\nAny muffin top on the side will distort\nthe silhouette of a dress which is tightly\nfitted at the waist. Anyone larger than a\nsize 6 in layers of tulle, folds and bulges will look like a cake. An elephant\npouncing on the spongy catwalk flooring wearing heavy fabric and toppling\naccessories in a pair of 4-inch stiletto\nwill inevitably sink through the stage.\nA crowded backstage interview on\nFashion TV is not a pretence filmed\nin a studio. Photographers, broadcast-ers, PRs, sponsors, make-up artists,\nhair dressers, models, seamstresses,\nassistants... If you have seen the real\nbackstage, you will stroke the sardine\u2019s\nhead and offer condolences next time\nyou open a tin. Until architects come\nup with elastic walls, people need to\nbe flexible enough to navigate through\nthe non-existent space.\nWhether or not one views models as\n\u201cthe perfect women\u201d is really a matter\nof personal taste. I once wondered why\nBurberry employed a horse for their ad\ncampaign. It turned out to be Agyness\nDeyn. Kate Moss has eyes that permanently stare sideways. Karl Lagerfeld\nsaid \u201cHeidi Klum always has a stupid\nsmile on her face\u201d, and her boobs are\n\u201ctoo big for catwalks\u201d. But Agyness has\nthat quirkiness that can sustain the\nchaotic styles that are currently dominating the catwalks. Kate has the impeccable versatility to carry any dress\nand murder any camera. Heidi has the\nbest bum. Ever.\nThere are always criteria people have\nto conform to for certain professions.\nI have never seen anyone to appeal for\nvarying levels of stupidity in doctors. I\nhonestly can\u2019t see a drooling and dazed\nkid cutting open someone\u2019s gut. Catwalk models are required to be shapeless and slender, just like doctors are\nrequired to be smart.\nFailing to acknowledge the reasons why catwalk models need to be\nthin, the campaigners are articulate\nenough to appreciate the truthfulness\nof a Dove advert. \u201cWomen, be happy of\nwhat you\u2019ve got\u201d! So why does skinny\nand tall people \u2013 who cannot control\ntheir metabolic rates - are worth their\ntrouble to empty a slot on their busy\ndiaries to dance on the street then?\nAre you genuinely happy or genuinely\novershadowed by the skinnies?

He is supporting\na company that discriminates against\nthe very thing he is!\nBut is it all alright, because selling\nyourself like this is simply letting others profit from you without you having\nto do anything other than be yourself?\nMaybe the \u201cthey sold out!\u201d reaction is\nsimply projecting your own hippy ethics onto other people.\nMaybe it\u2019s cool to sell your personal\nbrand because at the end of the day you\nare the one who gets the biggest slice of\nthe pie. And who cares what everyone\nelse thinks, after all, not caring about\nwhat other people think of you is the\nmost punk ethic there is.\nIf it were up to me, ads would be\nnarrated by David Mitchell as a talking dog. All ads in the future should be\nnarrated by David Mitchell as a dog.\nEven the consequences of drug use are\nmuch less patronising to listen to when\nit\u2019s the voice of the guy who once pissed in his work colleague\u2019s desk drawer\nand drew a swastika love heart on a\nPost-it.\nEmmy the Gritty\nBadly drawn\nalbums\nFiona Watt\n\u201cFalling in love\nfor the first\ntime, against\nthe backdrop of\nan old cassette\nplayer spitting\nout \u201cbroken\nHallelujah\u2019s\u201d\nHaving been tipped as the next big\nthing as long ago as 2007, Emmy the\nGreat\u2019s self-produced debut album\nFirst Love has been long awaited in\nanticipation.\nVocalist Emma Lee Moss has been\nlabelled as another indie kid huddling\nunder the \u2018anti-folk\u2019 umbrella with\nNoah and the Whale and Laura Marling. While she denies that this was\nher intention, she doesn\u2019t seem overly\nbothered by the classification. Refreshingly, she lacks the strive-to-be-different-at-all-costs mentality which\nafflicts so many of today\u2019s generic pop\nbands. She doesn\u2019t arrogantly claim to\nhave created her own genre or broken\nany boundaries: she\u2019s just made a really\ngood album.\nHer voice is youthfully girlish and although na\u00efve throughout, the album is\nupfront and often quite brutally hon-est. Putting it on for the first time and\nlistening to it in the background, you\u2019ll\nprobably think it a lively and sweet first\nalbum whilst happily humming along\nover your coffee \u2013 but giving the words\na proper listen gives the release a quite\nalarming new dimension and before\nyou know it your coffee\u2019s gone tepid\nand you\u2019re feeling pretty glum.\nIt all starts with \u2018Absentee\u2019. It\u2019s a melancholy tune about bereavement but\nthe vocals are fresh and the lyrics are\nruthlessly truthful. This is followed by\none which you may have heard already\n\u2013 the track \u2018We Almost Had a Baby\u2019,\nwhich was released as a single in November last year. The cringe-worthy\nlyrics (which begin \u201cYou didn\u2019t stop\nwhen I told you to stop\u201d and continue\nto describe her hopes of pregnancy\nto gain control over an ex-boyfriend)\nphysically make me squirm. It\u2019s sung\nin such a way that even though at first\nyou, of course, assume it\u2019s a bit of joke,\nby the end the serious tone has you\nworrying about Emma\u2019s mental health.\nBut it\u2019s simple and strangely likeable\nand when you stop wincing, you just\nmight really enjoy it.\nHer lyrics continue to be the most\ncharmingqualityofthealbumthrough-out. The songs are clever and unique\nand all quite sad. She confesses herself\nthat she was no musical prodigy, and\nyou can tell that her attitude towards\nwriting isn\u2019t to tick any boxes: there are\nno anthemic choruses and she certainly doesn\u2019t try to water down her songs\ninto some vague sentiments that everyone can relate to. She just says what\nshe thinks.\nThe title track is definitely one which\nstands out on the album. It is laced\nthrough with the tune of Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 and is written about\n\u2013 guess what? Falling in love for the\nfirst time, against the backdrop of an\nold cassette player spitting out \u201cbroken\nHallelujah\u2019s\u201d. It\u2019s just lovely. The last\ntrack, \u2018City Song\u2019, definitely deserves a\nmention too. It\u2019s another love song, or\nmore accurately a ballad of lost love. It\u2019s\nAfter five years of recording singles, Emmy the Great finally\nreleases her debut album of heartbroken love songs.\nreally nice: the guitar strums faintly in\nthe background whilst her stark voice\nand elegant lyrics take the limelight\nfor the last time. There\u2019s even a chance\nthat a few tears might drop into that\ncold coffee of misery by this point.\nIn short, I think this is an artist who\nis in danger of getting a lot more criticism than she deserves from cynics\nwho haven\u2019t really gotten the point. It\ntakes a good listen and it\u2019s definitely a\ngrower. Even though the lyrics are a bit\ndepressing, it somehow has a youthful\nand carefree sound about it. You can\ntell that she doesn\u2019t take herself too\nseriously, and behind the pessimistic\nand mildly aggressive words hide self-depreciating lyrics and a very genuine\nmodesty. The result is a really intimate\nalbum which seems to say \u201ceverything\u2019s\npretty terrible. Let\u2019s just get over it.\u201d\nHopefully, there will be much more to\ncome.\nThanks to those of you who did my\nalbum quiz and emailed in with your\nquiz results, I never expected you all to\nget so many, it makes me feel warm and\nfuzzy to know there are lots of people\nlurking around Imperial who are quite\ninto music and who also read felix.

It was the first\ntime the mothers of Britain and their\nsons were listening to the same band at\nthe same time, and was the catalyst that\nstarted the gradual merging of Radio 1\nand Radio 2 that continues to this day.\nLooking back over the track list today,\nthere isn\u2019t one song that I don\u2019t think\nwasn\u2019t a single, or at least it seems that\nway to me. Is that because the songs\nwere all so catchy, or just because they\nall sounded the same?\nWhilst an interesting question, this is\nbeside the point because it was a good\nrecord all the same and won the 2004\nMercury Prize for its quality. The follow up, You Could Have It So Much\nBetter, was less same-y but (some\nmight argue, consequently) less popu-lar. Musically it was still credible and\nenjoyable to more die-hard music fans\nbut The Franzes had strayed from their\nwinning formula and the album faded\nquickly into indifference compared to\nthe kingly reverence its predecessor\nhad enjoyed amongst the Jonothanrossian masses. After this, Franz Ferdinand disappeared for some time. Now\nthough, they are back, with a third al-bum, Tonight.\nTonight is like a Wikipedia tour of\npopular music compared to their de-but, which was more like a massive\nfuck-off book all about one topic (\u2018Syncopation for Dummies\u2019). Each track is\na sortie into a new genre, but all with\na distinct Franz Ferdinand twist. It\u2019s\ngot disco beats with funky bass-lines.\nIt\u2019s got folky finger-twiddling on\nacoustic guitar. It\u2019s got crunchy\nelectro riffery. It\u2019s even got\nwhat could pass as a guitar\nsolo. It would be something\nof a stretch to say this album\nhad something for everyone\n\u2013 Jay-Z fails to make an appearance and there are no\nviolin concertos, but the\naverage guitar pop aficionado should be easily satisfied.\nListening to this album is something of\na challenge. It is lightly\nspattered with medioc-rity, evenly distributed\nthroughout so that\nyou are repeatedly allowed to just begin to\nenjoy yourself when\nthe next bit comes and ruins every-thing. After about half an hour of\nthis torment you will find your tolerance waning and your finger edging\ntowards the skip button with steadily\nincreasing fre- quency. If you make\nit all the way through\n\u2018Lucid Dreams\u2019, you\u2019re made of sterner\nstuff than I.\nTonight represents the next stage in\nFranz Ferdinand\u2019s attempt to distance\nthemselves from their debut and rede-finethemselves.LikewhenChristopher\nEcclestone left Dr. Who after just two\nseries, the band gave up on a\nFranz Ferdinand\nTonight\nDomino\nHHIII\n23\nFriday 27 February 2009 felix\nMusic\nAlistair Garner\ngood thing far too early and have still\nbeen unable to replace it. Whilst there\nare some tolerable foot-tappers on here\nand a couple of genuinely good songs,\nthere are also moments when you can\nactually feel the drudgery weighing\ndown your shoulders as you\nlisten.

We seldom\nmake eye contact\nand I wouldn\u2019t dream\nof taking her out with me (her name is\nVesper[3] by the way). We haven\u2019t been\nspeaking for almost a month now and I\ndon\u2019t think that our relationship is going to be repaired any time soon[4].\nI feel pretty sad about the whole\nsituation; everything was rosy until the incident. I felt pretty stylish\nwhenever Vesper and I hit the streets\nof Fulham[5]. I felt like I had truly \u2018arrived\u2019. I thought that people would see\nme ride past on my orange 49cc (not\n50cc, round numbers are definitely not\ncool) Italian goddess and think \u201chey\nthat guy knows a thing or two about\nhow to treat a lady\u201d.\nBut it became painfully clear that I\ndidn\u2019t know how to treat this lady. It\u2019s\ntrue what they say about women, that\nthey don\u2019t tell you what\u2019s wrong until\nthe volcano is ready to blow. I\u2019m still\nnot sure what I did to sleight Vesper,\nmaybe she hated my faux-chic helmet\nthat was labelled \u201cFashion Helmet\u201d\n(and she\u2019d be right to hate it), but she\nwas never understated, not in her looks\nand not in her demeanour; she never\ndid anything by halves.\nThat Sunday morning began like\nmost. My body awoke in bed and my\nmind awoke in the shower. I threw\non my Union Bar shirt[6] and a fine\nday behind the bar lay ahead of me. I\nwent downstairs, behind my block of\napartments and said good morning to\nVesper. I gave her ten minutes to get\nready (she doesn\u2019t like to be rushed)\nand began my journey up Fulham\nRoad.\nThen the argument began, she started shouting. Louder and louder. The\nengine began to roar uncontrollably\nand we sped inexorably towards 90\u2026\n(kph, let\u2019s not get carried away, she\u2019s\na 49cc scooter). I reached for the keys\nto shut off the engine but in a final act\nof malice she gave the front wheel a\ntwitch, a twist and we both became\nintimately acquainted with the hard\ntarmac road.\nI did the thing that most people do\nafter an argument; I called my friend.\nMy housemate Rob[7] left work to\ncome help me back on my feet (not lit-erally, again let\u2019s not get carried away,\nshe\u2019s only a 49cc scooter). Work at the\nUnion Bar still called and like with all\narguments in public places, Vesper\nand I held our emotions in check until\nwe were both safely home (but much\nworse for wear) late that evening. She\nhad tried to re-ignite the argument on\nthe way home but I was much quicker\nto defuse the situation than the first\ntime and after a few minutes of deep\nbreathing at the roadside, crisis was\naverted. Of course there were still\nthose snide comments, every now and\nagain the engine would cut out while I\nwas waiting at the lights.\nI\u2019m still not entirely sure why Vesper\nis angry with me. The couples counsellor told me that we lack the self-control to build a fruitful relationship;\nthat in short, the carburettor was\nbroken[8]. But I worked on it; I fixed\nthis problem (I should know, I\u2019ve got\nthe receipt). Still, however, our relationship refuses to bear fruit. Because\nwhile she tells me that everything is\nfine, I still see the malicious glint in\nher eye. She gives me clues, like the\nleft indicator not working, and she\nteases me, she gives the front wheel a\nshake, laughing mirthlessly as I cling\non for dear life; after ten minutes with\nVesper, I am a shell of my former self,\na jittery bag of nerves.\nSo we don\u2019t speak any longer, we seldom make eye contact and I wouldn\u2019t\ndream of taking Vesper out with me[9].\nMy patience is wearing away fast and so\ntoo does my love for her. Now I spend\nmost of my time on the bus; he\u2019s a good\nfriend, stoic and reliable, if not slightly\nirritating at times (oh hell, in truth\nI hate the bus but at least I don\u2019t fear\nfor my life every time I get on it). And\nalthough I tell myself that I don\u2019t need\na woman in my life, that they are just\ntrouble, my heart disagrees. I recently\nmet a new girl from Brick Lane. She\u2019s\nquite thin and although some people\nthink she\u2019s just a hipster, I think she\u2019s\npretty cute. Her name is Pixie; she\u2019s a\n\u2018fixie\u2019[10].\nRob tells me that I\u2019m making the\nsame mistakes again. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have\nbrakes!\u201d[11] he implores. And I haven\u2019t\ntold him but she says she\u2019s not going\nanywhere with me if I\u2019ve got a helmet\non, apparently it\u2019s not \u2018cool\u2019. But hon-estly? I\u2019m just looking for another rush,\nthe bus will never satisfy any man after\na moment with Vesper.[12]\nKadhim Shubber and his Vespa are not speaking\n\u201cIt\u2019s true what\nthey say about\nwomen, that they\ndon\u2019t tell you\nwhat\u2019s wrong until\nthe volcano is\nready to blow\u201d\nGilead Amit discloses an all-consuming addiction\n\u201cMost of us\nhave our first\npassionate affair\nwith a book, and\nthe experience has\nus hooked for life.\u201d\nM\ny desk, which offers\nthe largest horizontal working surface\nin my quaintly miniature room, is currently hors combat. The workspace is\nthreatened by a highly unstable pile\nof books, which casts its shadow over\nmost of the space available in my little cubbyhole. I have taken to working\nwhile lying down on my bed, surrounded by absorbant cushions to protect me\nin the event of a structural collapse.\nThe reasoning behind this new topographical element in the landscape of my\ncubiculum is simple. I love books. I buy\nbooks. My shelf space is exhausted. Ergo\nbooks pile up on the table. Hardly the\nsort of syllogism that would have kept\nSocrates up nights. No; he was far too\nbusy coming to grips with his own mortality\u2013ordrinkingwedlock\u2013orengaged\nin some other such Attic nonsense.\nThe space in my private boudoir\nmay be limited, but what there is has\nbeen used wisely. Two large bookcases\ndominate the South-facing wall \u2013 one\nstuck in a convenient nook, the other\nmountedontopofmydesk.Therebylim-iting my workspace from the word Go.\nThese two brave plywood constructions have given as good as they have\ngot over the past sixmonth, calmly accepting whatever load was placed on\ntheir weary bolts and tired joints. The\nBritish soil on which they were mass-produced from trees grown abroad has\ndoubtless had its effect in producing a\npair of uniquely stoic storage units.\nTheir resilience has been truly re-markable, but this last straw has finally\nbroken their camel-coloured backs.\nSpace has run out on their ample\nshelves, with books piled horizontally\non top of others and all available gaps\ncrammed with deserving volumes. As a\nresult, the eleven striking tomes which\nare the latest additions to my collection can fit nowhere other than on the\ndesk previously described.\nThis latest mass immigration has\nbeen sparked off by a week spent\nscouring the second hand bookstores\nof central London. The families of battered editions clamouring for a better\nplace to live are hard to turn away.\nIn truth, I don\u2019t mind. Not only because at the moment I\u2019m hammering\nthis out in my departmental common\nroom, where the lack of desk space is\nless evident, but because I couldn\u2019t have\nfound more charming roommates.\nSomething about the way second-hand\nbooks are brought up makes them ideal bedside companions. It must be all\nthat time spent in musty, dingy, dusty\nand mingy bookstores, watched over\nby ardent bibliophiles in sweaters several sizes too big and crooked glasses\nprotecting their light-sensitive retinas.\nThese stores are my spiritual home.\nPlaces of pilgrimage, of worship and\nof relaxation \u2013 the additional stop I\nam always willing to make no matter how long the day has been or how\nmany puddles I have been pushed into.\nThere is nothing quite so peaceful as to\nbe surrounded by bookshelves full to\nthe point of bursting, and to gently run\none\u2019s finger along the spines of a set of\nentirely heterogeneous volumes in the\nhope of striking gold.\nPerhaps not a first edition Gutenberg or, rarer still, a second edition\nJeffrey Archer, but simpler, more\nmeaningful treasures. The chance to\nbroaden one\u2019s horizons is rarely as\ngreat or as unrestrained, and the sight\nof two books lying side-by-side that\nshare neither author, nor topic, nor\nlanguage, nor century of publication\nleads to wonderful and unexpected\nmental associations.\nTo think that the books packed into\nthose overpopulated shelves have delighted a thousand owners, known a\nthousand cities and been read a thousand times builds a powerful connection with the rest of humanity. To read\nthe soft dedications to parents and lovers copperplated onto copyright pages;\nto notice the underlining of key passages or the scrawlings of distracted\nstudents from past decades pulls one\ninto the maelstrom of the human\nreading experience.\nForgive me. To paraphrase Gladstone, I have been carried away by the\nexuberance of my own pomposity. But\nwhere the written word is concerned,\nwho can blame me? A book is an object of the most intense passion we\ncan bestow upon inanimate objects.\nOur need for knowledge and adven-ture, our erotic attraction towards the\nunknown, and even our love of other\nhuman beings is nowhere else so compactly and attractively packaged.\nAnd while I can sympathize with an\namateur librarian who likes to keep a\ncollection in pristine condition, the\nsight of bent spines and dog-eared\npages sends a shiver of glee down my\nown warped backbone as an indication\nof a genuine physical relationship with\nliterature that is in no need of false\nmodesty or imposed purity.\nMost of us have our first affair with\na book, whether in the form of a one-night stand or a lengthy romance, and\nthe experience has us hooked for life.\nWords, to borrow one of Kipling\u2019s\nmost powerful lines, are the strongest drugs that mankind has ever used.\nThey are simultaneously more addictive and capable of arousing stronger\nemotions; they can be as dangerous\nand as soothing; and the variety available on the streets is certainly as likely\nto contain lethal impurities.\nBooks are the easiest way many of us\nare able to get our fix. All we have to\ndo is find an isolated corner, roll some\npaper and let ourselves be transported\nto either heaven or hell on the wings\nof language, propelled by the engine\nof syntax and guided by the rudder of\npunctuation. The winds of overblown\nmetaphor are powerless to hold us\ndown.\nI will continue to satiate my appetite\nfor words to my heart\u2019s content \u2013 and\nif this cheap toke fails to satisfy your\ncravings, be gentle: I plead guilty of\nwriting while under the influence.\nReferences\n[1] - J.D.

An\nundoubtedly talented man is speaking of the failings of pyrosequencing\nin today\u2019s industry, but you\u2019re simply\nimpermeable to all his wisdom he is\ngiving away for free (well, part of the\n\u00a33000 you\u2019re paying..). The knowledge\nhe exudes just waits amongst the dusty\nair, swirling around, enticing an opportune moment for your brain to switch\nback on and soak it up.\nYour mind switches to what you\u2019re\ngoing to do once you step free of this\ndusty but apparently beneficial experi-ence. Since I\u2019m far too lazy to make my\nown sandwiches at home, or even to\nhave breakfast before I leave the house\n(which to be honest, is disgraceful), my\nmind seems only to wander onto the\nDan Wan picks a bone with Captain Questions\n\u201cSometimes, I\nenjoy the odd\nquestion, I see it as\nchance to do a bit\nof \u2018extra reading\u2019\nwithout having to\nopen my eyes\u201d\nglorious want of food. Clearly I\u2019m not\nthe only one either, because College\nChicken and Bacon baguettes are always in rare supply even minutes after\nan 11am lecture finishes.\nAs your stomach moans at you\nfor sacrificing breakfast for an extra\n10 minutes sleep that morning, you\nwonder how quickly this lecture will\nbe over. However, there\u2019s always one\nperson standing between you and the\nwonderful taste of chicken, mayonnaise and bacon between an oddly half-baked baguette; Captain Questions.\nCaptain Questions, as you may have\nalready guessed, loves to ask questions.\nHe, or she, must ask at least one question per slide despite the collective tut-ting that occurs every time their piggy\nlittle voice sounds. Of course, most\nlecturers are delighted to be asked\nquestions. They spew out the same set\nof lectures almost mechanically each\nyear and welcome the insight Captain\nQuestions brings to their day. You can\u2019t\nblame them for spending five minutes talking avidly about the research\nthey\u2019re involved in to answer Captain\u2019s\nquestions. If someone asked me about\nwriting for Felix, I\u2019d probably do just\nabout the same. I can\u2019t speak for them,\nbut I assume they also feel obliged\nto answer Captain comprehensively.\nHowever, these five minutes are still\nfive minutes further towards my stomach shrivelling into a useless but very\npainful ball of organ.\nYou probably think I\u2019m one of those\nwaste students that sit at the back of the\nlecture theatre and just sleep or play\nmental charades with my other per-sonality. I\u2019m not. I ask questions too;\nmainly because my brain doesn\u2019t function brilliantly without these chicken\nand bacon baguettes and hence don\u2019t\nunderstand most concepts laid down\nin front of me. I even enjoy the odd\ninsightful question, I sometimes see it\nas chance to do a bit of \u2018extra reading\u2019\nwithout having to open my eyes.\nThe reason I have such a disdain for\nall those Captain Questions out there,\nis that each of your questions are carefully constructed to contain 1) the fact\nyou already know a lot more about the\ntopic than is being currently discussed\nand 2) an \u2018insightful\u2019 question that you\nprobably won\u2019t listen to because you\u2019re\ntoo pleased with yourself that you\u2019re\nable to do 1).\nAnother graph pops up on the pro-jector. The lecturer has just about\npointed out the axes, when trusty ol\u2019\nCaptain speaks up again. Another five\nminutes of self-gratifying attention\nfrom the lecturer, and we finally move\nonto the next slide.\nIt eventually gets to the point where\nyou\u2019re preparing your own noose from\na collection of scrap paper and shoe\nstring. You\u2019re just looking towards the\nceiling to see if you can spot any solid\nhooks to tie to, and just in time, you\u2019re\nsaved by the mass shuffling of paper\ninto bags as the lecturer duly apologies for not covering all the slides and\nrunning over the allocated 50 min-utes. As I unravel the makeshift noose\nin order to put my shoes back on, I\u2019m\nin two minds. One induces a sense of\ninjustice; why should the lecturer be\napologising for overrunning and not\ncovering all relevant material? We\u2019re\nthe ones that will suffer when we don\u2019t\nhave any notes for the last 20 slides\nwhen it comes to revision. It\u2019s all due\nto the minutes of pointless off-topic\nquestioning. The other thing on my\nmind is that of potential creamy, salty\nand meaty semi-delights.\nSadly enough, guess which mindset I\nact upon?\nI\nam a true believer that while\nlearning is an interesting experiment in itself, it really is mostly\nabout realising what it is that\nyou do not know, and hence deriving the utmost pleasure from arriving at the concept that no matter how\nmuch one does, there is always something new to learn. I find it absolutely\nfascinating that as human beings, we\nwill never be able to capture and absorb the essence of what it is to belong\nto our species for that would entail a\ncomprehensive knowledge, and most\nimportantly understanding, of well...\npretty much everything.\nWhile learning about a given subject adds beauty and objectivity to any\nargument, it is even more beautiful\nknowing that, most likely, someone\nwill know more about it than you. Instead of seeing this as a threatening\ncharacteristic in any one person, it\nseems to be much more enthralling\nto learn from this person. Even if you\ndon\u2019t necessarily agree with whatever\nis being said, there is always scope to\nlearn something, even if it is learning\nthat you have learnt very little at all.\nConstant questioning for the sake\nof questioning might seem, and oftentimes is, pedantic. When done right\nand for the right reasons however, it\nshould almost inevitably lead to a little\nbit of self-evolution and increased self-knowledge. It is certainly a strange idea\nto think that we can evolve within our\nlife times. The fact that we are seemingly stuck in a physically unevolving\nspecies is an almost universally accepted idea. It isn\u2019t that we are literally not\nevolving as human beings, but discerning any real changes caused by evolution in our short life spans is close to\nimpossible as we are certainly not mutating rapidly enough. Bar convoluted,\ncomplicated and potentially dangerous genetic enhancements (or merely\nchanges), there is very little we can\nactually do on this Earth to feel even\nthe thinnest and most modest sliver of\nevolution within ourselves.\nA way we can taste a little bit of the\nnectar is to think about evolution in\nsuch a way that from now on it includes\nthe evolution of personal and collected\nknowledge as an integral constituent of\nthis abstract concept. If we think about\nevolution in such a manner, every\ntime any event, conversation or situation leads to thinking differently about\nsomething, we have somehow evolved.\nInteresting conversations usually have\ntwo possible outcomes. The first is that\nnothing really changes within you and\nthis is by far and large the most common scenario. Even though the conversation might have been interesting\nit need not have been enriching in any\nway shape or form.\nSometimes though, there is one of\nthose perfect moments where everything you hear makes sense, but goes\nagainst something you supposedly\nunequivocally believed in. You begin\nto question life-long conventional wis-doms and begin considering not thinking of them as benchmark ideas or\npersonal thoughts. Something strange\nhas happened. Something quite magic\nand potentially life-altering. You have\nchanged your mind. This is the ultimate form of any sort of evolution we\ncan almost literally feel.\nMy mind is neither weak nor feeble\nnor prone to indoctrinations of most\nsorts. I also don\u2019t change my mind as\noften as might potentially be inferred\nfrom this comment piece, but truth be\ntold, I find very few things in life that\nare satisfying as changing my mind\nfollowing a long, conversation with a\nfriend whom I respect. It\u2019s not necessarily that I like being proved wrong or\nhave some sort of self-confidence issue that prompts me to take the view\nof whoever I am talking to. It is merely\nthat I love the fact that I can, and if\nthere is a compelling enough reason for\nme to do so, I will change my mind.\nAnagnorisis is more a process of self-improvement through time rather than\none of instant gratification and it genuinely makes me happy that as human\nbeings we are capable of feeling it.\n\u201cAnagnorisis\nisn\u2019t sudden; it\u2019s\na process of self-improvement\nthrough time\u201d\n\n"

During a flute\nsolo, a friend exclaimed \u201cI just can\u2019t get\nthe mental picture of Ron Burgandy\n(From \u201cAnchorman\u201d) out of my head\u201d.\nLet\u2019s Tea Party have been heavily\ntipped for the big time world of indie-pop stardom this year, by the likes of\nNME, XFM and BBC Introducing.\nBased on that performance I would say\nthey were a funny, charming, pop version of The Young Knives, and worth\nmaking the effort to see again.\nNext up, Favours for Sailors, an alt\nrock foursome. Although an enjoyable\nband to watch, I felt guitar acts were\nat a disadvantage. In comparison to\nthe imaginative electro acts on rest of\nthe bill, they sounded flat and generic .\nFavours for Sailors were at times Reminiscent of Razorlight, The Cribs and\nKing\u2019s of Leon. Perhaps in a different\ncontext, their guitar rock could shine.\nFinally on the bill, the impressive\nPortasound. Whistling solos, nob\ntwiddling solos, dancable electro pop-made with analogue and digital instru-ments. My highlight was the infectious,\nuplifting single \u201cThe Wrong Parade\u201d. I\nwant to dance just talking about it. I\nthought the keyboard solo was just so\n\u201csquiggly\u201d for want of a better term. As\na frame of reference, I consider I think\nthey are a more electro Late of the Pier.\nIn fact they recently remixed Late of\nthe Pier\u2019s \u201cBroken\u201d. On tour they have\nsupported Metronomy, Friendly Fires,\nShitdisco, and they firmly fit in that\ngenre of band.\nFinally the Rockfeedback DJs kept\nthe dancefloor going until the early\nhours with a surprising mix of the\nrevered classics (Rock the Kazbah,\nBeastie Boys, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) mixed\nwith the new.\nThe frivolity continued as E.T, yes\nE.T, made an appearance on the dance-floor. And he has \u201cthe moves\u201d ! Using\nhis unusually flat head, he executed\nsome break dancing moves which\nwere out of this world! At 3 am after a\nhard slog on the dancefloor, with some\nstrange characters, we all went home,\nE.T. included.\nVideopia returns on March 10th with\nremakes of \u201cWilly Wonka\u201d and on May\n12th with \u201cGhost Busters\u201d.

Seriously,\nafter a hectic party week-end, the recovery process\nis a very long experience.\nThe problem is I can\u2019t seem to fall\nasleep until 6 o\u2019clock in the morning.\nWith lectures at 9, it is most definitely\na hard push to get things done. This\nreminds me a lot like what happened\nduring New Years, when I spent 3 days\nin a row awake. The difference here\nis that this time I just don\u2019t have the\nholiday time to catch up on sleep. Well\nthat is enough bitching, let me tell you\nabout a funny story.\nIt happened this Wednesday to be\nprecise. A friend and I were coming\nback to the union, after the very entertaining rugby match during varsity. To\nsay we\u2019ve had a couple of drinks is an\nunderstatement. A severe one.\nSo, we were walking along Prince\nConsort Road and were stopped in\nfront of the archway at Beit to talk to\nanother friend. Conversation com-mences, and in order to look \u201ccool\u201d I\nsay a complicated word.\nNow I won\u2019t repeat this word, and\nyou will most likely never find out,\nhowever let me assure you it sounded\nvery sophisticated. The mistake here\nRavi Pall\nCoffee Break Editor\nis that this word does not actually ex-ist. Both of my friends here asked me\nwhat it meant, I had no clue whatso-ever. Man I looked like an idiot. When\nI explained the reason why I used this\nword, and after much deliberation, it\nwas apparent to my peers that this was\nmost definitely not a word in the Oxford English dictionary.\nThis brought me to think that I\nmust actually make up a lot of words.\nIt\u2019s true, if I don\u2019t have an appropriate\nword I\u2019ll just make one up.\nThe problem with this is no one corrects me by saying that it isn\u2019t a real\nword, so I carry on using them. My\nquestion to you guys, the readers of fe-lix, is do you make up words too?\nIf you, like me, make up random\nwords to fit the situation, email us at\ncoffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk. In other\nnews, an apology from Kadhim Shubber, who totally messed up the coffee\nbreak page last week, by dropping the\nlines of the bottom of the text boxes.\nEPIC FAIL comes to mind. Seriously\nwhat a mug. If your going to help me\nout on the twitter competition, do me\na favour and post how much you hate\nhim. He deserves it.\nwww.twitter.com/D00SKI\nDo you make\nup words too?\nTop Trumps\nCut them out!\nHighest score\nwins\nCollect them all!\nWatch this\nspace for\nadditional cards\nBattle of the Smiths\nKnown from:\nThe Matrix\nMost kick ass scene:\nFight with Neo in subway station .\nNumber of female fans:\n3 (some people are weird)\nFavourite weapon in a fight:\nDesert Eagle\nFactoid:\n\u201cIS 5416\u201d on the license plate of Smith\u2019s\ncar refers to Isaiah 54:16 in the Old\nTestament:\n\u201cBehold, I have created the smith that\nbloweth the coals in the fire, and that\nbringeth forth an instrument for his\nwork; and I have created the waster to\ndestroy.\u201d\nKnown from:\nMultiple\nMost kick ass scene:\nRolling out thundering punches in the\nring as Ali.\nNumber of female fans:\napx 1 Milion\nFavourite weapon in a fight:\nFists of fury\nFactoid:\nWill Smith donated $4,600 to the presidential campaign of Democrat Barack\nObama.\nBarack Obama later went on the win\nthe presidential election, in case you\nwere wondering.\nKnown from:\nGuilds President\nMost kick ass scene:\nBeing tied up as the ICU RAG squad\nstole the mascots Spanner & Bolt.\nNumber of female fans:\n0\nFavourite weapon in a fight:\nFree biro from Barclays\nFactoid:\nMark is an avid member of the extreme\nironing association of Britain.

Editor Kadhim\nShubber and I have just started using twitter. Join in and add us as\nfriends. By the end of the term, the person with the least number of\nfollowers will have to drink a pint through a shoe, in front of everyone\nwho wants to see. So start adding us now, for fun and entertaining\nstatus updates I\u2019m going to go straight off the bat, and give myself an\nadvantage.

We didn\u2019t make it easy for ourselves though\u2026 Down for the entire\ngame, after the third quarter Colette\npromised the girls a match report\n(with special bonus details on twat of\nthe match Rachel Dilley, hehe) if they\npulled their socks up and won it. So\nhere it is.\nThe night before the game the girls\nwere struggling, due to numerous\nmembers of the squad being injured,\nto get a team together at all. Luckily PhD student Alex Godlee gallantly\nstepped in at the last minute (1130pm,\nI was having a minor heart attack) and\nthe girls headed off to the surprisingly\nsmelly Berrylands via Wimbledon and\nfree curry.\nPerhaps it was the snacks weighing\nthem down, perhaps the fact that they\nhadn\u2019t had their traditional Powerade\nboost (other sports energy drinks are\navailable) or maybe it was the fact that\nthey arrived at 6.15 when the game was\nsupposed to start at 6pm so had to get\nstraight on with no warm-up but IC\n1s were half asleep in the first quarter.\nLSE clearly weren\u2019t fully on it either\nthough, except for their uber lively\ncentre, and didn\u2019t take full advantage\nso at quarter time they were only 5-3\nup. The low goal count was due to having to play short quarters to make up\nfor our lateness.\nIC knew they weren\u2019t playing half as\nwell as they could and team captain\nRachel told us so. Play in the defensive D was solid as ever thanks to the\nwell-rehearsed duo of GK Kate Chapman and GD Rachel Dilley. Defence\nwere working hard and making great\ninterceptions but needed to bring it\ndown the court further. Nina Davies at\nNetball\nImperial 1st 17\nLSE 1st\t\t 16\nColette Gregory\nWA, eventual player of the match, was\nworking too hard and having to get on\nthe end of every ball. At half time it was\n6-5 to LSE and Imperial were bringing\nit back. We just needed to slow it down\nand play our game as we wanted to.\nBiased umpiring led to WD Alex constantly being pulled up for contact and\ndistance. GS Sam Westrop was getting\nvery frustrated as the umpires were\nsomehow managing to foresee the future and repetitively blew up for an\nLSE back line before the ball had even\ntouched the ground off court. One person who did deserve to be pulled up for\ncontact though was GA Colette Gregory who was utilising her new found ag-gression. This was much to the delight\nof Kate who enjoys watching a good\nscuffle from a safe distance down at the\nother end of the court.\nAt one point in the final quarter IC\nfell 4 goals behind as LSE led 15-11\nbut if it\u2019s one lesson we\u2019ve learnt this\nseason it\u2019s to keep our heads up! Determined to go into Varsity on a high\nthe girls dug deep and banged in shot\nafter shot. Carolyn and Nina provided\ngreat support working it round the attacking circle to give Colette and Sam\nsome closer attempts at goal.\nAt the final whistle the court went si-lent. No one on either side seemed fully certain what the score was; the game\nhad become so intense everyone was\nconcentrating too hard on their play to\nthink about anything else. Sam turned\nto dumbfounded Colette and said \u201cWe\njust won\u2026\u201d as if half trying to convince\nherself. Nobody dared react though\nas they didn\u2019t want to pre-empt the\nwin and look like prize numpties. The\numpires announced the score: IC 17 \u2013\nLSE 16. Whoops of joy and girly little\njumps echoed down the court, mainly\nled by Carolyn. A group hug followed\nalong with a nice team talk from our\ncaptain Rachel who was \u201cvery proud\u201d\nof our performance. Meanwhile the\nLSE GK clenched her fists and wailed\n\u201cNooooo!!\u201d Slightly o.t.t. in this netballer\u2019s opinion but then again they\nhad just been beaten by a team that\nhas lost to everyone else this season\nincluding several teams that they had\nalready beaten by a significant margin\n\u2013 gutted!!\nAfter our win we were in a boisterous\nmood and ladette conversion swayed\nonto discussing the finer points of\nthe merkin (that\u2019s a lady garden wig\nfor those who aren\u2019t familiar with the\nterm) whilst in the changing rooms\nand on the journey home. Our team\ncaptain and twat of the match seemed\noddly informed in the department of\nrasta fashioned muff toup\u00e9s\u2026 I\u2019ll leave\nit at that shall I Rachel? ;)\nNetball may be a non-contact sport, but taking balls to the face happens\nIC Football 2nds\non a hot streak\nICUAFC 2nd XI rolled into this week\u2019s\nvarsity clash on a hot streak. After\nstruggling for form before Christmas,\nthe 2s have put in a series of impressive\ndisplays in both the ULU and BUCS\ncompetitions to stave off relegation in\nthe former and push for promotion in\nthe latter competition. An unfortunate\ninjury to Captain and Bola-Bola favourite Mitchell Fern has allowed him\nto mastermind two victories and a hard\nfought draw from the sidelines. Despite\nan ever changing line-up composed of\nmore than 20 players over the previous\nthree fixtures, Mitch\u2019s tactical nous\nproved too much for the opposition.\nThe 2s first fixture post-snow saw\nthem face a brutish Hertfordshire side\nwho came to Harlington expecting a\nstroll but were shocked early on when\na beautifully curled through ball from\nMatty Smith put Damian in behind the\ndefence and he caught the keeper cold\nwith a first time hit from an acute angle which flashed in at the far post. The\n2s rampaging opening 20 minutes was\nthen further rewarded when Max rose\nhighest, glasses on, to meet Grego\u2019s\npinpoint corner and nod it in for a 2-0\nlead. At this point the home side proceeded to fall asleep and an audacious\ncross-come-shot looped over Paul in\nthe 2s goal to leave the score 2-1 at\nhalf-time.\nDespite a rousing team-talk from\nMitch, Hertfordshire continued to\npound away at the Imperial backline\nand a quickfire double, with a tap in\nfrom a neat free-kick and another\nlobbed goal, allowed the away team to\ntake the lead for the first time in the\ngame. The 2s needed something to lift\nthe spirits and the Hertfordshire centre forward obliged receiving a second\nbooking for a lunging challenge on\nMax. This, coupled with the introduction of the fastest man alive in Sim,\ngave Imperial the impetus they needed\nto press on. The equalising goal came\nscrappily after a sustained bout of pressure when the ball was lumped hopefully into the box landing at the feet\nof Matty Smith who looped it cleverly\nover the keeper\u2019s head. With 10 minutes to go Mamzi was introduced on\nthe wing to provide the guile necessary\nto carve open the Hertfordshire back\n4 but unfortunately Sim was unable\nto finish after his clever through ball.\nHowever with five minutes remaining Ron, who had battled terrifically\nthroughout in midfield, provided another scintillating ball which sent Sim\nthrough 1-on-1 to finish exquisitely\nand win the match.\nThe 2nds looked to continue their\ngood form 3 days later when they met\nLSE 2s in a relegation scrap. With only\n11 players travelling to Berrylands it\nwas going to be a tough ask but the 2s\nanswered the call. The game started at a\nfrenetic pace with both teams creating\nseveral half-chances with Sim looking\nespecially dangerous up front, cracking the cross bar with a sumptuous\neffort after breaking in behind from a\nlong ball played by Paul Reynolds.\nHowever it was to be LSE who took\nthe lead when their striker used his\nexceptional pace to speed away from\nthe Imperial defence and finish with\naplomb. The lead was to be short-lived\nthough, a foul on the half way line\nwould usually spell little danger but\nnot with a certain roving midfielder\nprowling on the edge of the area. Jonny Hill swung in a dangerous ball and\nRomain lifted himself, like the proverbial salmon, through the air to plant a\nheader into the top corner. This boosted Imperial who pushed for a second,\ncoming closest when Grego lifted a ball\nthrough for Jeremy, only for his shot to\ncrack the outside of the post. Half time\ncame with this epic tussle poised delicately at 1-1.\nThe 2nd half was a back and forth\naffair with both teams enjoying spells\nof pressure but neither really creating\nany clear-cut openings. With the game\ncreeping towards the final few minutes\nLSE managed to scramble an opening\nwith a penetrating cross from the left,\nthe ball falling to their centre forward\nonly for Fitz to throw himself in front\nof his strike, taking one for the team\nand preventing it from crossing the\nline. This was followed by a mesmer-ising challenge from Jon Card to take\nthe rebound off the foot of another\nLSE player and scoop it over the crossbar from no more than 2 yards out.\nThese two season saving interventions\ninspired a final flurry at the other end\nwith Damian picking the ball up deep\nbefore turning his man and delivering\na pinpoint pass to Sim in the LSE area.\nSim skillfully evaded the challenge\nof one defender before being hacked\ndown by a second, and hearing a swift\nwhistle from the referee who pointed\nto the penalty spot. His strike partner\nDamian, stepped up to coolly side foot\nthe ball into the bottom corner sending the keeper the wrong way. Imperial\nwithstood a final LSE barrage to claim\na hard-fought victory.\nImperial 2s then faced a testing trip\nto Cobham to face a UCL 2s team\nsweeping all before them in BUCs.\nOnce again though, with a changed\nline-up, IC 2s pulled of an impressive\nresult. In a tight opening few minutes,\nthe away side took an early lead when a\nGrego corner struck a UCL leg diverting it past the keeper into the corner.\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nds 4\nHertfordshire Men\u2019s 3rds 3\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nds 2\nLSE Men\u2019s 2nds 1\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nds 1\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nds 1\nDamian Phelan\nImperial pressed for more with neat\ninterplay between Viktor, Damian and\nGrego creating opportunities which\ndidn\u2019t quite find the target. However it\nwas UCL who would strike next right\non the stroke of half time, when an in-swinging free-kick was met by a glancing header which deceived James Skeen\nin the Imperial goal, this the only blot\non an otherwise excellent performance\nfrom the Club Captain saving several\ntimes at point blank range. The 2nd\nhalf exhibited the growing potential\nin the IC 2s team, with a resolute performance at the back from Fitz, Mark,\nJon Card and Jonny Hill restricting\nUCL\u2019s potent attack, allied with some\nneat attacking play just failing to yield\na winning goal. Notable mention must\ngo to Viktor for a couple of audacious\nbicycle kick through balls which bamboozled the UCL defence as well as the\nIC attack.\nImperial footballer showing concentration from the pressuring opposition player\nWell done to Mochten Sie Mein Manschaft for winning last week\u2019s cross-word.

But any aid would first have to be approved by Congress. It is estimated that the 22-day war between Israel and\nHamas has caused about $2bn worth of damage in the Gaza strip.\nIn the run-up to the donor conference, anonymous sources have also reported that Hillary Clinton has been pressing Israel to stop blocking aid to\nthe besieged Gaza strip. Currently all borders remain closed, with only intermittent opening for supplies classified by Israel as being \u2018humanitarian aid.\u2019\nThe day after the conference Hillary Clinton will visit Israel and the West\nBank, where senior advisors say aid will be a central issue of discussion.\nUSA\nBackin2007,whenVenezuelansfirstdeniedtheirPresidentHugoChavez\nthe chance to run for more presidential terms after his term expires in\n2013, he described the result as \u2018shit\u2019\n, and promised to reverse it.\nMr Chavez, launched a new campaign, blatantly using state resources for\npersonal ends. He turned the second referendum into a vote on himself and\nwon, but only by a slim majority. Similar referendums on the extension of\nPresidential powers have taken place in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru in recent\nyears.\nIn a country where oil revenues account for half of the government\u2019s source\nof income, when the price falls, the government has reason to be worried.\nOil revenues have plummeted (from $92 billion last year to just $26 billion\nthis year), and Mr. Chavez\u2019s\nsupport may slip along\nwith it. His socialist movement gains its support from\nVenezuela\u2019s poor, but the\nPresident assures them they\nwould not suffer from the\ncrisis. If his support base\ncontinues to slide, he will\nbe handing over an indefinite stay in power to the encroaching opposition, come\nthe next elections.\nVenezuela\nBangladesh\nChaos erupted in the streets of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, after the\nmutiny of a group of boarder security forces resulted in one death and\nleft many wounded.\nThe dispute was allegedly over pay, working conditions, discrimination and\ncareer advancement and the newly elected government has already stepped\nin and offered amnesty to the mutineers who have now returned to their\nbarracks.\nThe event revealed just how fragile the democracy is in Bangladesh. It has\nonly recently emerged from several years of military rule. Much of the military\u2019s revenue now comes\nfrom the UN, as Bangladesh\nis one of the largest contributors to UN Peacekeeping Forces. The large bounty\nfrom the UN, which also\ncompensates the govern-ment, does not benefit the\nborder security forces, and\nthis large discrepancy in\nsalary may well have flared\nWednesday\u2019s violence.\nBumper year for ICU RAG\nRAG week: crazy kids doing crazy things in the name of charity\nLast week\u2019s Imperial College Union\nRAG Week was a resounding success;\nfeaturing the RCSU Ball, CGCU slave\nauction and many other events. Students thoroughly enjoyed themselves\n(see picture right, for evidence of smiley faces) and raised money for this\nyear\u2019s charities, Barnardos, Shelter and\nThe Rainbow Trust.\nLast Wednesday proved to be the\nbusiest day; In the afternoon RAG\nRAID was set off with students in\nfancy dress and RAG t-shirts journeying across London to complete a list\nof tasks and collect money. The RAID\nwas an astounding success, with one\nlucky lady - Lu Lu Meng, amassing\nover \u00a3200 in her bucket and winning\nthe best individual collector prize! A\nbox of Krispy Kreme doughnuts will be\non its way to you shortly.\nEvery lunch time, with help from\nthe football club, the Queen\u2019s Tower\nwas opened for tours which proved to\nbe very popular; despite having been\non all week the majority of visitors\nturned up of Friday, with large queues\nand, due to group-size limitations, we\neven had to turn people away! Tom\nPost wowed visitors with his wealth of\nknowledge. Coming up with such classic facts as: \u201cThe top of the Albert Hall,\nThe Queen\u2019s Tour and the centre of\nthe Natural History Museum are in a\nperfect line North-South.\u201d Who knew?\nWith this and the great views (see picture below) it was well worth the \u00a33\nto climb the tower. From the top you\ncan see across Hyde Park, and on a\nclear day you\u2019ll see the London eye and\neven read the time from Big Ben! If you\nhaven\u2019t climbed the 324 steps to the\ntop ICU RAG may put on some more\ntours next term- so keep a look out!\nOther lunch time events included a\nJCR stall with the society Students In\nFree Enterprise (SIFE), who were selling Tanzanian paintings on behalf of\na school in Tanzania. If you liked the\npaintings but was too busy to buy at\nthe time, contact SIFE at Imperial.\nKatya-yani Vyas, from the RCSU\ncommittee, helped to organise the\nfirst major RAG event of the week; the\nRCSU RAG Ball at Maya in Soho. She\ntold felix: \u201cFollowing the success of last\nyear\u2019s ball we wanted to make sure this\nyear was just as sensational. With tickets selling out a day in advance, there\nwas much disappointment amongst\nthose who had not yet secured their\nticket, and I was inundated with phone\ncalls, text messages and emails from\nstudents wishing to acquire a ticket on\nthe day of the event. I apologise if you\nwere not able to come, but I will shift\nthe blame onto the ruthless facebook\npublicity campaign.\n\u201cThe event proved to be hugely suc-cessful, but lets be honest, with 5000\npounds behind the bar, how could it\nhave gone wrong?\n\u201cMaya won \u2018Best New Club 2008\u2019\nand it was easy to see why; the classy\ninterior, comfortable seating areas and\nintimate atmosphere factored in making the ball one to remember. Surveying the dance floor, it was clear that the\nsea of sharply dressed young men and\nelegantly attired young ladies were enjoying themselves immensely. The eclectic mixture of chilled out indie/elec-tro, drum and bass and mainstream\ndance music proved to be popular as\nwe showcased dJ-ing talent from our\nvery own students, Fabric and Kiss\n100.\n\u201cMost importantly, a substantial\namount of money was raised for RAG\nwhich was hopefully a good omen for\nfund raising throughout the week.\u201d\nWednesday was a manic montage\nof fund raising, with RAG RAID, the\nCGCU slave auction, and pub crawl.\nwithin 12 hours. RAG-RAIDER Afonso Campos told felix: \u201cRAG raid was a\ngreat success, the team I belonged to\nraised almost \u00a31000. We did a human\npyramid in front of St. Pauls, \u2018borrowed\u2019 lots of things from LSE, raised\nmoney in tube stations- it was great\nfun!\u201d\nIn the evening, Alice Rowlands and\nTom Post auctioned several nervous-looking slaves with around \u00a31500\nraised in total. One of the more valuable lots was Mech Eng Senior Tutor,\nDr Crofton, who went for \u00a3300 to attend a peace rally at the G20 summit.\nTwo titans of the student media world,\nLive! Editor Kirsty Patterson and felix\neditor-in-chief Jovan Nedic, entered\na bidding war that could have ended\nwith felix being re-branded as Live! for\na week and Live! as felix for the rest\nof term. Muttering that the re-brand\nwould suit felix as it would look like a\ncheap tabloid to match the standard of\nwriting are probably just disgruntled\nbusiness school members throwing\ntheir toys out.\nAt the same time, running battles\nwith laser guns were being marshalled\nin the Union quad and members of the\nrugby, hockey and netball clubs toured\nthe pubs of South Kensington in spiff-ing golfing attire.\nWith money still being counted as\nfelix goes to press, RAG has raised at\nleast \u00a38000 this year, which is a stirling effort from chair, Jon Downing,\nwho has a final message of thanks for\nall those who helped make RAG week\na success: \u201cI\u2019d like to thank everyone\nwho gave their time to organise RAG\nthis year. The committee has been\ngreat!\u201d\nLook closely and you\u2019ll see I should have been in lectures when I was at the top of the Queen\u2019s tower!\nJon Downing\n& Alice Rowlands\nRAG RAID: Woah! Yeah we\u2019re on TV - yeah! We look cool man! Duude!\n\n"

Miso\nBlake, orphaned at\nthe age of seven,\npenniless, abandoned her four year-old\nbrother Han and left Korea. She grew\nup in England, became middle-class;\nwhilst Han struggled to survive and fell\ninto destitution. When Miso goes back\nto find him, her guilt, his hatred, and\ntheir mutual disgust at their own lives\nare played out in unforgiving fashion.\nUbiquitous here are extremes and\nintensity of emotion. The two fall in\nlove. The incestuous nature of this is\nperhaps meant to play a key role (\u201cI am\nyou. You\u2019re the marrow in my bones,\nyou\u2019re in my genes, in my body.\u201d) but\nfar more prominent is the pain and\nguilt of separation destroying the two.\nLives full of destruction are difficult\nto repair. The scenes between Jennifer\nLim (Miso) and Mo Zainal (Han) overwhelm us with sexuality and longing,\nand it is powerful when they fall asleep\nin each other\u2019s arms. How disturbing\nyou find this may depend on your sibling count. For me, it was a beautiful\nand simple moment, which typifies the\nplaces of clarity, which the piece is often able to draw from its frantic bulk.\nBythisImeanthefactthatsex,money\nand violence are in every scene. Unable\nto cope with her emotions for Han, and\nneeding money for him, Miso attempts\nto destroy herself. She sells her body\nto Jack Cash, a wealthy English hotel-ier. While sleazy, and morally dubious\n(with a wife and children at home), he\nis refreshingly honest about his desires\nfor her. In portraying this in the context of the brother-sister relationship,\nthe writer (In-Sook Chappell) is perhaps inviting us to evaluate our views\non the morality of sexuality and mon-ey. But the piece often comes across as\nunnecessarily nihilistic, in the face of\na basically happy situation. In the end,\nmany of Miso\u2019s actions must be down\nto some tragic flaw, rather than due to\ncircumstance if we are to make sense\nof the play as a whole, and actually to\nprevent the play descending into the\nridiculous. Because I think this play,\nlooked at from different angles, possibly even viewed on different nights,\nis both tragedy and farce. It is difficult\nto get a grip on, which all rests on how\nwell integrated and relevant one finds\nthe subsidiary themes of modern money and sex \u2013 so brashly are they pre-sented, they begin to feel superfluous\nby the end.\nThe dialogue is good, and in the\nMiso/Han scenes has a poetic quality \u2013 ideal for expressing the themes of\nlonging and memory. Other scenes, especially those with Cash, contain well-written humour and are entertaining.\nThe actors make the most of this, and\nseveral times I was impressed with the\nquality of delivery. Cash\u2019s Essex accent\nwas wonderfully to-the-point. Miso\u2019s\nmiddle-class English tones sounded\na bit too authentic for someone who\nleft Korea at seven, but made her estrangement with her native land is obvious throughout. The staging, while\nsimple, was nice, and the Soho studio\ntheatre space was used to good effect\n\u2013 the modernist design of the building\nseeming to echo the present-day urban\nKorean landscape in which the play is\nset.\nSo, we are provided with a nicely\nround aesthetic experience. At the centre are authentic themes of love transcending time. Go see it, if you think\ncan work out what it all means. And\nthen tell me.\nShowing at the Soho Theatre\nuntil 7th March\nOoh Baby Baby.... Jennifer Lim as Miso and the Essex Boy Jack Cash. Courtesy of Simon Kane\nF\new Shakespeare plays kick\noff with Calvin Harris\u2019 dance\ntune, \u2018Girls\u2019, with the supposed streets of sixteenth\ncentury Padua resembling\nany given town in Britain on a Saturday night \u2013 drunken antics in shopping trolleys and blow-up naked dolls\nincluded.\nThis is how Conall Morrison\u2019s production of The Taming of the Shrew\nfor the Royal Shakespeare Company\ncaptures the attention of the teenaged,\nhalf-term audience, before the fear of\nsitting through three hours of Shakespeare kicks in.\nBelieved to be one of his first plays,\nThe Taming of the Shrew is a comedy set\nin Padua, home to the travelling Italian\ntheatre group the Commedia dell\u2019Arte.\nThe group toured England at the time\nwhen Shakespeare was a boy and are\nthought to have influenced him, exploring the oldest and most pervasive\nform of discrimination: misogyny. The\nwealthy Baptista has two daughters;\nthe younger, fair Bianca with suitors\na-plenty and the wild, acid-tongued\nKatherina, to whom no man dares go.\nBianca\u2019s suitors, frustrated with her\nfather\u2019s refusal to let Bianca wed before her older sister, find a man mad\nenough to marry Katherina (for her\nlarge dowry). Enter Petruchio, who is\nmore than a match for the Shrew and\neventually succeeds in bending her\nto his will, taming her in the process.\nMuch comedy and confusion ensue\nafter master and servant, Lucentio and\nTranio, swap roles so that Lucentio\nmay woo Bianca under the guise of being her tutor.\nConall Morisson has managed to\nmake Shakespeare\u2019s dialogue and wit\nnot only decipherable but also hilari-ous, whilst at the same time breaking\napart any preconceived notions of the\nplaywright being cumbersome and\nstiff.\nThe script is tied to the energetic,\nhighly slapstick \u2018choreography\u2019, seam-lessly making the play flow but also\nmaking us feel as if we are watching\na Ben Stiller comedy. And it is in this\nwhere the play fails.\nThe first twenty minutes of the production feel more like a pantomime,\nwith much overacting and a totally\nsuperfluous song-and-dance routine.\nThe play resumes some slight seriousness when the modern attire is\nrelinquished for period costume and\nStephen Boxer drops his Brummie\naccent for the standard RP, one more\nfitting for a Shakespearean lead, as he\ntakes on the role of Petruchio after\nplaying the drunk Christopher Sly in\nthe induction.\nThe next two and a half hours waver\nbetween the script\u2019s excellence shining through and being swamped under\nbawdy gestures which make you slightly embarrassed, especially on behalf of\nany of the exceptionally young or exceptionally old in the audience.\nSpecial mention should go to Keir\nCharles, who receives many laughs as\nCelebrating 400 years of misogyny\nShakespeare\u2019s first play has a bawdy make-over in this RSC production, Caz Knight reports back.\nTranio with barely any obscene ges-tures. Michelle Gomez is superbly\ncast as the Shrew, but we are left with\nthe feeling that she is a bit of a one-trick pony after seeing her rehash her,\nadmittedly highly entertaining and\nunique, role as Sue White in Green\nWing. However, she pulls off Katherina\u2019s closing monologue with the\ngravitas it requires.\nThe Guardian criticised this production for glorifying domestic violence,\nas Petruchio goads and berates Katherina until she finally gives into obedi-ence. It is easy to see how the issues\ncontained within the play could make\npeople uncomfortable given today\u2019s\nvehement struggle for sexual equality:\nthe man gets what he wants and the\nwoman learns to want what she gets.\nAnd yet, the play continues to run a\ngood four hundred and twenty years\nafter conception: perhaps a bit of discomfort is worth the price of making\nsure these great works live on.\nF\nor once, I thought that when\nI saw the words \u201cCatholic\nPriest\u201d on the blurb of this\nnew play, maybe paedophilia\nwould be taking a night off.\nHowever, when you see the words\n\u201cCatholic\u201d, \u201cpriest\u201d and \u201cbefriend\u201d all\nin one sentence, you know it isn\u2019t to be\nthe case. I entered the auditorium of\nthe Donmar Warehouse full of suspicion and distrust. I had never seen this\ntopic treated sensitively, but I was to be\nsurprised. Be Near Me is the stage adaptation of the Booker-prize nominated novel of the same name by Andrew\nO\u2019Hagan, which sees an Oxford-educated Catholic priest enter a parish in a\npitiable town in Ayrshire, Scotland.\nLoneliness ensues, but he is rejuvenated by the striking up an odd friendship\nwith two chavs. Father Anderton is\nplayed by the awesome Ian McDiarmid\n\u2013 you may know him as The Emperor\nin the Star Wars films. After being starstruck for at least half of the first act,\nwe get to know Father Anderton as a\nkind, thoughtful pastor but with no real\npassion for the community he has been\nplaced in. He is far more interested in\nhis vintage wine, classical music and\nreciting poetry with his determined\nhousekeeper Mrs Poole, who is portrayed magnificently by Blythe Duff.\nThe play opens with some beautiful prose recited by Father Anderton,\nwhich will reappear hauntingly at the\nend of the play. The unusual soundtrack for the play involves members\nof the cast singing patriotic Scottish\nsongs and hymns which is rather lost\non the central London audience but I\nam promised that when the play first\nopened in Glasgow, the songs were\nmet with strong, positive feelings.\nNot only do the cast sing a number\nof these \u2018fillers\u2019 between scenes, but the\ncast mostly stays on stage during the\nentire first act as a symbol of the community in this small Scottish town.\nThe priest\u2019s community falls apart as\nthe cast diminish during the second\nact, when the priest looses allies and\nfriends after the unpreventable turning point in the play. The adaptation to\nstage (written by Ian \u201cDark Side\u201d McDiarmid himself) is true to the book and\nonly leaves out some scenes concerning Father Anderton\u2019s past, which can\nbe hinted at quite easily on stage using\nprops and longing facial expressions.\nThe Donmar Warehouse is the perfect\nsetting for a play like this, as the audience comes right up to the stage so the\nactor can see each face in the stalls, like\nhe is standing trial and the audience is\nhis jury. Be Near Me will mix up your\nemotions and leave you feeling sad and\nreflective, which I measure as a good\nthing on a theatre scale.\nThere are some laughs, like \u201cSometimes, I like my drink more than I like\nmy children\u201d or the inevitable chav/un-employed/ \u201cAt least he\u2019s got Sky\u201d digs,\nbut these jokes get more and more\nscarce as the play reaches it\u2019s quiet cli-max. Be Near Me is one for a fulfilling\nnight out, where your beliefs are challenged and eyes opened \u2013 see it and\nyou won\u2019t regret it.\nBe Near Me is showing at the\nDonmar Warehouse, Covent Gardren until 12th March\nStar Wars Emperor in role of priest\nRosie Grayburn is star-struck with a performance from Star War\u2019s Emperor, Ian Mcdiarmid.\nIan Mcdiarmid as Oxford-educated Father Anderton\nSex, money and violence: everything you need for the non-conformist Valentine\u2019s day\nIan Mcdiarmid as Oxford-educated Father Anderton\n\n"

I will assign part of\nthe blame for this to a sheer lack of\ntime but also in a small amount to the\nanticipation of seeing who my fellow\neditor, Mr Goldsack, wished to aggravate each week.\nIn any case, I have shaken off the\ndust and will now attempt to reassume\nsome kind of column-like rambling. So\nthis week has been a turbulent one in\nterms of politics. We have found ourselves questioning the conduct of some\npoliticians and offering heartfelt condolences to others.\nA week in which Labour peer Lord\nAhmed was sentenced to 12 weeks in\nprison after texting whilst driving on\nthe M1 led to a collision that proved to\nbe fatal for some of those involved.\nA week when UK opposition leader\nDavid Cameron\u2019s son died in hospital aged six having suffered his entire,\nextremely-short life from cerebral\npalsy and epilepsy. Now, I am no Conservative but no parent should have to\nendure the loss of their child, so I will\nplace to the side any hostility I have\ntowards Cameron and wish him the\nutmost sympathies during this difficult\ntime.\nAsforLordAhmed,perhaps12weeks\nin prison will allow him time to gain\nsome perspective and, I would hope,\nteach him a damned good lesson.\nSri Lanka; a beautiful island off the\nsouth coast of India, home to white\nsandy beaches, amazing wildlife and a\nrich heritage. But over the past twenty-five years, this serene landscape has\nbeen tarnished by a bloody war.\nBefore colonisation, the island\u2019s different communities co-existed peace-fully, living in separate Kingdoms,\nenjoying parity of status albeit under different rulers. However, during 1517-1948 (The Colonial Era) the\ncountry was invaded on separate occasions by the Portuguese, Dutch and\nfinally the British, who unified the\nKingdoms for ease of administration.\nOn the 4th February 1948, Sri Lanka\n(then Ceylon) gained independence\nfrom the British who left the country\nwith a unitary constitution which was\nsubsequently amended by the Sinhala\nmajority \u2013 this was to be the start of\nover half a century of political tension.\nThe political shift from a mixed\nTamil and Sinhala government to solely Sinhala produced the general feeling of unbridled-dominance amongst\nthe minority Tamils. The introduction\nof various laws such as the \u2018District\nQuota System 1972\u2019, \u2018Policy of Standardisation 1973\u2019 and the \u2018Sinhala Only\nAct\u2019 saw the Tamils having to achieve\nsignificantly higher points in order to\nenter university in comparison to their\nSinhala counterparts and being refused\ngovernment jobs if they lacked fluency\nof the Sinhala dialect; reaffirming their\nfeelings of oppression.\nThis saw the formation of the Tamil\nUnited Liberation Front (TULF) who,\nwith the support of the National Tamil\nminority and the International Diaspora, contested the Parliamentary elections of 1977 with a clear manifesto for\nTamil Nationhood, winning vital seats\nin the North and East of Sri Lanka.\nIn 1981 the Jaffna Public Library,\nwhich housed over ninety-seven thousand volumes of Tamil literature, including irreplaceable ancient palm\nleaf manuscripts, was set ablaze by the\nSri Lankan police destroying all the\noriginal evidence of Tamil heritage in\nthe Island. Many Tamils felt this was\na consequence of their political successes in the North-East and this essentially fuelled growing hostility.\nA series of protests and riots broke\nout articulating the feelings of oppression and discrimination against the\nminority population. The vision of\n\u2018Tamil Eelam\u2019 was born: the dream of\nthe Tamil Nationals and Diaspora to\nhave a self-run state on the Island \u2013 ul-timately, the hope of autonomy.\nOver the past thirty-five years various organisations emerged to voice\nthe general opinion of oppression and\nconflicts broke out over the welfare of\nthe Tamil people. Some took passive\npolitical stances, whilst others took\nup an armed struggle having felt that\ntheir initial efforts were in vain. The\nmost prominent conflict to start was\nthe war waged between one of these\norganisations, now known as the LTTE\n(Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) and\nthe government.\nSince the start of the war, seventy-five thousand people have been killed\nby indiscriminate shelling. Both sides\nhave been accused of severe human\nrights violations by independent parties and the International Red Cross.\nHowever, the total ban on external media sources and International peacekeeping processes by the government\nhas meant that there are no details of\nthe humanitarian atrocities. Further to\nthis, wide scale demonstrations across\nthe globe, such as the one-hundred-thousand strong march that occurred\nin London Westminister on 31st January 2009 outlining the carnage in Sri\nLanka, have received significant media\ncontainment due to political pressures:\nthe voice of the Tamil people has \u2018inadvertently\u2019 been silenced.\nSri Lankan forces stand guard in the recaptured town of Mullaittivu\nKatya-yani Vyas\nPolitics Editor\nRighto, now that I have dedicated half\nof this column to a sort of pseudo-rant,\nI will proceed to deal with the \u2018Most\nPopular Man in the World\u2019 and his unfortunate counterpart on this side of\nthe Pond. Of course I am referring to\nBarack Obama and Gordon Brown.\nBrown would do well to take some\ninspiration from Obama\u2019s popularity,\nand possibly attempt to re-create it in\nthis country, a steep hill to climb indeed but possibly not an insurmountable one.\nTony Blair\u2019s reign was tarnished by\nhis relationship with a certain American President, an indication that diplomacy with the US is a major factor in\ndetermining the mood of the British\npublic. So, perhaps Brown could allow\nthe same rule to give a vitality boost to\nhis tenure.\nA \u2018special partnership\u2019 between Britain and America could see an end to\nthe anomaly of global financial institutions being regulated locally, or the\nintroduction of the Tobin tax which\nwould set aside a small percentage of\nevery foreign transaction, helping to\nachieve Brown\u2019s long-standing dream\nof providing education for every child.\nBrown must be wary though. The\nBlair-Bush bridge broke spectacularly\nunder the strain of public opinion. He\nmust ensure cooperation from the rest\nof Europe to strengthen the links this\ntime.\nNo one will remember Brown\u2019s days\nas the Iron Chancellor, he will forever\nbe our Paper Prime Minister.\nIt has been a\nwhile...\nSri Lankan struggle\nOver the past few weeks the war has\nescalated severely, and whilst the government claim to be achieving success\nover the LTTE, over one-thousand\nTamil civilians have been killed within\nthe space of three weeks by indiscriminate shelling of schools, hospitals and\nvarious other institutions in a government allocated \u2018safe zone\u2019 in NorthEast Sri Lanka. Meanwhile a further\ntwo-hundred-and-fifty thousand civilians are trapped in areas of conflict\nwithin arms reach of artillery fire, with\nminimal humanitarian aid and little\nhope of escaping safely.\nThe case of the government and the\nLTTE is the centre of much contro-versy; and it seems that today\u2019s society\nis comfortable using this as an excuse\nto turn a blind eye to the tragedies of\nthis humanitarian crisis. It would seem\nethically fundamental that it is a common agenda to every individual to see\nthat all human beings have the right to\nlive with dignity, autonomy and freedom from the fear of death.\nAs students we are a force; we have a\nsocietal stand and the power to make\na difference. Please help us do so by\nshowing your support.\n\u201cPeace can only last where human\nrights are respected, where the people\nare fed, and where individuals and nations are free.\u201d The Dalai Lama.\nCabinet cover-up?\nJustice Secretary Jack Straw announced\nthat he would use a clause in the Freedom of Information Act to block the\npublication of minutes of key Cabinet\nmeetings held in the run-up to the Iraq\nwar in 2003, those in which the war\u2019s\nlegality was discussed.\nReleasing the papers would do \u201cserious damage\u201d to Cabinet government according to Straw and this\noutweighed the public interest issues.\nThis disregards the ruling by the Information Tribunal last month that they\nshould be published.\nThey had rejected a government\nappeal against the Information Commissioner\u2019s ruling that the papers\nbe published because the decisions\ntaken regarding the invasion of Iraq\nwere \u201cmomentous\u201d and controversial.\nThe government could have appealed\nagainst this decision in the High Court\nbut has decided instead to use the ministerial veto for the first time. Proponents of the Freedom of Information\nAct see this as evidence that the government has no legal basis for stopping\npublication.\n\u201cThere is a balance to be struck between openness and maintaining aspects of our structure of democratic\ngovernment,\u201d Jack Straw said. \u201cThe\ndamage that disclosure of the minutes\nin this instance would do, far outweighs\nany corresponding public interest in\ntheir disclosure.\u201d\nThe Conservatives backed this de-cision, since the release of minutes\nwould make ministers more reluctant\nto discuss controversial subjects in\nfuture, impeding good governance.\nHowever, Shadow Justice Secretary\nDominic Grieve said that the way the\ngovernment has handled the issue\nshowed contempt for the Freedom of\nInformation Legislation.\nThe Liberal Democrat justice spokes-man, David Howarth, said the decision\nwas \u201cmore to do with preventing embarrassment than protecting the system of government\u201d. He said it was in\nthe public\u2019s interest to know that the\nCabinet, as a decision-making body,\nhad \u201ccollapsed\u201d in the run-up to war\nand been manipulated and replaced by\na select number of individuals around\nthe then-Prime Minister, Tony Blair.\nThe release of the Cabinet minutes\nwould reopen controversy over then-Attorney General Lord Goldsmith\u2019s\nadvice on the war. His advice to Tony\nBlair given on 7th March raised questions about the legality of military action without a second UN resolution\nand was not shown to the Cabinet.\nRichard Thomas, who backed publication on interest grounds, said the\nexercise of a veto over standard FOI\nprocedures must be \u201cexceptional\u201d. Sri Lankan police investigate the explosion site of a suspected Tamil suicide bomber in Vavuniya\nNishanth Sivarasan\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\nEdward Townes\nFor the good of humanity, drugs must be legal\nThe War on Drugs, and the illegality of\ndrugs in general, is arguably the cause\nof the most senseless waste of human\nlife and resources in the history of\nmankind. In the United States alone,\n$50 billion dollars is spent each year\non attempting to disrupt the drug mar-ket, equal to the combined budgets for\nthe country\u2019s agriculture, energy, and\nveteran\u2019s programs. This does not take\ninto account billions more in damages to private citizens and millions of\nlives around the world destroyed every\nyear.\nAmerica\u2019s prison population of 2.3\nmillion, where one third are drug-re-lated convictions, costs a further $60\nbillion per year and has earned the\n\u201cleader of the free world\u201d the dubious\nhonour of holding more inmates than\nthe rest of the world combined, along\nwith the greatest incarceration rate of\nany major country, ever.\nDespite this tremendous cost, drug\nconsumption in the US has reliably\nincreased throughout the prohibition.\nThe War on Drugs is a catastrophic\nfailure from any perspective, but I wish\nto argue that even an effective war is\nunjustified and evil, even harming\nthose most in need of help.\nThe central problem with calling\nthe production, distribution, and consumption of a substance a crime is\nthat there are no involuntary parties to\nthese activities. When someone grows\npot on their land, they are not harming anyone else; no victims have come\nforward as plaintiffs.\nWhen drug dealer and user make a\nvoluntary exchange between them-selves, they are not harming anyone\nelse. This means that the government\nhas created a new category of victimless (i.e, political) crime. Laws that\ndefine victimless deeds as criminal\nshould not exist. Period.\nEvery law that does is a transgression\nagainst liberty. Nothing damages the\nrespect the public has for their government than the creation of laws that it\ncannot possibly enforce effectively.\nIn addition, there are important\nconsequences from making drugs illegal that affect both crime and public\nhealth.\nA frequent justification for making drugs illegal is that it is better for\npublic health. The reality is the exact\nopposite. First of all, there is no empirical evidence that making drugs illegal\nleads to any decrease in consumption.\nIn fact, there is evidence to the con-trary. In countries with more liberal\ndrug laws, the consumption of drugs\nis generally lower, by a large margin,\nthan countries with more authoritarian drug laws.\nSimilarly, there is no data to support\nthe claim that consumption of softer\ndrugs necessarily leads to harder drugs.\nDubai has received criticism from its people and from international organisations for the Atlantis hotel, the\nlatest in a string of lavish projects\nIndeed scientists have proven with rats\nthat this relationship simply does not\nexist on a chemical level.\nSecondly, making substances illegal\nharms quality accountability in the\nmarket. This means that a large portion of the drugs consumed have been\ncut with other substances that are\nconsiderably worse for the health of\nthe consumer than the drug itself, and\ncreate uncertainty in the potency of a\ngiven dosage, leading to overdoses.\nFinally, using the health of the consumers as a justification for prohibiting their voluntary activity amounts to\nthe government assuming it has a role\nin protecting us from ourselves. This\nlogic, when taken to its full implica-tions, is clearly tyrannical.\nMost people already understand that\nwhen you make a market illegal, many\nare newly defined as criminals who\notherwise do not break the law. They\ncan also understand that the majority of the revenues of the drug market\nmake it into the hands of murderous\ndrug lords.\nWhat most people do not appreciate is the vast amount of derivative\ncrime created when you make a market black. When you declare a market\nillegal you deny all the actors in that\nmarket redress of grievances through\nthe court and justice system. This leads\nthe participants in the illegal market\nto find other means to sort out their\ndifferences, which invariably leads to\nviolence.\nFor example, if I agree to buy a kilogram of cocaine from a business as-sociate, and then decide to screw him\nover and not pay up on delivery, can he\ngo to the police and have me arrested\nfor theft/fraud? No. His only option\nis to attempt to recover his damages\nhimself by force. How many gang wars\nhave you heard about over who gets\ncontrol of streets to distribute alcohol?\nLast time that happened, surprise sur-prise, was the alcohol prohibition in\nthe 1920\u2019s.\nAlcohol is, in fact, an excellent case\nstudy in understanding the consequences of prohibiting drugs, and\nany time that you want to see how\nthe drug market would manifest if it\nwas not illegal, the alcohol market is a\ngood place to look. Do we have militias guarding fields of barley? No. Do\nwe have frictional relationships with\ncountries that export alcohol? No.\nDo we have governments around the\nworld secretly profiting from the alcohol market to the detriment of their\npeople? No. Do we have kids travelling\naround the world with vials of alcohol\nin their rectums? No. Do thousands\nand thousands of people die every year\nattempting to transport and distribute\nalcohol? No. Do alcohol addicts looking for their next drink commit most\nof the burglaries? No. The list goes on\nand on.\nThe fact of the matter is, making\ndrugs illegal is not only a complete and\nutter failure that creates massive harm\nfor humanity, but the justifications\nfor even attempting it are flawed and\ntotalitarian.\nThe world would be a vastly better\nplace if governments left people who\nwant to consume a substance of their\nown choice in peace.\n\u201cA frequent\njustification for\nmaking drugs\nillegal is that\nit is better for\npublic health.\nThe reality is the\nexact opposite\u201d\n\u201cMaking drugs\nillegal is a\ncomplete failure\u201d\n\n"
