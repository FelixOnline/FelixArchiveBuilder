    "content": "Edited by: Eva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n22\nThe Tragedy of Macbeth: Distilled to its core\nFilm review\nDeniz Akansoy Film Writer\nAdapting any theatrical play to the silver screen is\na difficult task. It poses various challenges, such\nas maintaining the intended tone set by the playwright while introducing a new sense of realism that is\nbrought by the film format. When the play in question\nis arguably the most famous Shakespearean Tragedy\nto have ever been written, the stakes are unequivocally higher. Ever since the dawn of cinema, there have\nbeen many adaptations of Macbeth, some considerably\nbetter than others. We\u2019ve seen it all; from samurai-era\nJapan (Throne of Blood, dir. Akira Kurosawa, 1957) to\na small-town diner in Pennsylvania (Scotland, PA, dir.\nBilly Morrissette, 2001), the story has been adapted\ncountless times, yet the themes explored in the story\nremain as current as they were 415 years ago.\nThe Tragedy, as director Joel Coen refers to it, is a\nmasterclass in filmmaking. It brilliantly achieves to\nconvey the personal intimacy one would normally expect from watching a play in real life, through the constraints posed by the big screen. In fact, Coen mentions\nthat he did not want to \u201cdeny that the text was created\nas a play and theatrical construct,\u201d further adding that\nhe\u201chadnointentionofmakingitanaturalistfilm,such\nas the route taken by many others including Polanski.\u201d\nOnewayinwhichthemovieachievesthis,isthrough\nvery intentional use of set-design and very stylistic cin-ematography. \u201cEvery frame a painting\u201d is usually a saying associated with Stanley Kubrick, however I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s farfetched to argue that it equally fits the visuals of this movie. By shooting the entire movie on a\nsoundstage and having complete creative control over\nthe environment, Coen gets the best of both worlds\n- he makes sure that the world-class cast of actors can\nmake the roles their own with creative choices, and the\nmovie stays as true to the source material as possible.\nThe cinematography is nothing short of magical.\nIn fact, stylistic choices made by Coen in conjunction\nwith cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel - whose previous works span the likes of Amelie, Darkest Hour and\nThe French Dispatch \u2013 makes the movie resemble a surrealist painting at times, without completely detaching\nthe audience from reality. At the end you feel like the\nmovie was more like a dream than a movie you actively\nwatched on screen.\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio brings a sense of suffocation and\nclaustrophobia, which becomes increasingly apparent\nas tensions rise; the characters cannot escape their des-tinies, their fates are sealed. Furthermore, symmetry\nis both used and then intentionally broken to create a\nsense of uneasiness. This especially becomes apparent\nas the movie progresses, creating a sense of sickliness\nand nausea which reflects Macbeth losing his sanity.\nThe set design beautifully complements the cine-matography. From the get-go, the hostility of the land\nis reflected to the audience with the presentation of\nScotland as a barren land with no love or joy, a land of\nfake smiles and hidden daggers. The harsh lighting, the\nuse of heavy contrast, and the overall choice of black\nand white all contribute to this sickly atmosphere, devoid of happiness and hope. The interior d\u00e9cor of the\ncastle, or lack thereof, with the very minimalist choice\nof design, creates a sense of emptiness that sticks out,\nlike a form of deafening silence.\nBlazing through his soliloquys with style, Denzel\nWashington brings a sense of charisma to the role of\nthe tyrant, as he portrays a much more muted and\nfatigued Macbeth. This is an older Macbeth, a weary\none in his 60s, and as such, the theme of youthful ambition is much less emphasized. Washington acts with\nsubtlety, \u201cunderplaying\u201d the part until the last act in\nwhich Macbeth fully loses all sanity. Frances McDormand plays the role of the instigator, as Lady Macbeth,\nbeautifully. Her choice in acting almost humanises the\n\u201cpower couple\u201d in certain situations, yet this allows\nother certain scenes to be even more jarring and shows\nthem as the brutal and heartless people they really are.\nThe real show stealer, however, is esteemed theatre actor Kathryn Hunter, playing the role of all three witch-es. The witches lie at the very heart of the movie, setting everything in motion, and manipulating Macbeth\nas the story unfolds. Even though most of the movie is\nvery much realistic, the movie embraces the theme of\nthe supernatural, as Hunter brings a real sense of eeriness to the role.\nTo conclude, The Tragedy of Macbeth is excellent\non a technical level, and I would recommend it to any\ncinema lover. Be warned that your level of enjoyment\ncould be limited to your previous knowledge of the\nsource material, and the experience could be jarring at\ntimes due to the use of Shakespearean English. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t go into the\ncinema (or stream it) with an open mind.\nDirectedby: Joel Coen\nStarring: Denzel Washington, Frances McDormand, Bertie Carvel, Alex Hassell\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nWhat\u2019s on?\nOscar nominations are out\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Let us know what you think about the nominees!\nWhat could be considered the most famous film prize-giving ceremony will take place late March, but the nominations have just been announced early this week.\nCategories include best picture, costume design, cinematography, makeup and hairstyling, best original song and original screenplay.

The\npolice have previously\nsaid that even in times\nof diminished Covid\nregulations they still\nenforce the rules \u201cwhere\nthere are clear breaches of the\nrules\u201d, and these breaches could\nhardly be more clear. There were\n118,438 Covid Fixed Penalty Notices\nprocessed up to October 2021, and\nit would be woeful for the police to\nturn a blind eye to the government\njust because of their position.\nThat being said, in practical terms\nit is quite disruptive. Boris needs to\ngo, and countless Tory backbenchers\nand donors have said so over the past\nweeks. His approval ratings are lower\nthan Theresa May\u2019s were at her worst,\nyet still he clings on. What seems to\nbe causing this is a fine balance of\nconsistent lying and exceptionalism\nversusapparentmisguidedloyaltyand\nthelackofanobvioussuccessorasPM.\nSomewhere in this careful balance\nlies the threshold where enough\nMPs are sufficiently annoyed that\nthey write a letter calling for a vote\nof no confidence to the chairman of\nthe 1922 committee. It\u2019s extremely\nunlikely that a Cabinet member\nwould do this, leaving it up to the\nTory backbenchers to pen a total of\n54 letters. Once this happens, a secret\nballot among Tory MPs would take\nplace, and if a majority vote against\nhim, Boris is out. The flip side of this\nis that if Boris survives a VoNC, then\nanother one cannot be held for at\nleast a year, cementing him\nin the position for\na while longer.\nQuite the digression,\nand I apologise, but\nnow back to the Met\ninvestigation. A \u2018furious\u2019\nSue Gray released her\nsubstantially redacted\nreport into the goings on\nin Number 10 over the lockdown\nperiod at the end of January. Whilst\ncertainly not good news for Johnson,\nso many details and key aspects of\nthe particularly heinous events were\nnot included, by order of the Met\nso that they did not prejudice its\ninvestigation. Because after literally\nmonths of dithering and declining\nto investigate the Number 10 parties\non some of the shakiest ground I\u2019ve\never heard, it swoops in whilst Gray\nis mid-report and demands most\nof the heat be redacted. And now\nwe wait God knows how long for a\nglacial Met investigation to play out,\nno all-encompassing, crushing blow\nis dealt to the PM in one go, and\nhe limps on towards the imminent\nparliamentary recess which will\nessentially confirm he has survived\nthis round.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n24\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBlack Country, New Road release a future cult classic\nWritten by Rosie Millns Music Writer\nBlack Country, New Road have had perhaps an\nunorthodox journey as a band. In 2018, they\nformed in Cambridge from the ashes of a former pro-ject. The band quickly began on a dizzying journey\nto the front of the South London underground post-punk scene, eventually being signed by Ninja Tune and\nreleasing their debut album For The First Time just last\nyear in February 2021. By the time they were the face\nof the scene, BC,NR had moved on, leaving their post-punk origins behind them. Not slowing down for a sec-ond, the band released their second album, Ants from\nUp There, exactly 364 days later.\nReleasing two albums in a year is an incredible\nachievement, let alone for both albums to be critically\nacclaimed \u2013 FTFT was nominated for a Mercury\nPrize, and AFUT has been universally hailed and is an\ninstant contender for album of the year. However, the\ndeparture of lead vocalist Isaac Wood just four days\nbefore the album\u2019s release has left a more sombre tone\nover the album \u2013 it is a huge achievement, but it is also\na goodbye.\nAFUT was supposed to be a turning point for the\nband \u2013 a departure from the post-punk roots from\nwhich they grew to fame. It was not realised, perhaps,\njust how significant of a turning point this would be\nuntil the announcement of Wood\u2019s leaving. The six-remaining members have stated they are not going\nto play any songs from the first two albums out of\nrespect for Wood, meaning the BC,NR as we knew it is\ngone. This is maybe not unexpected from a band who\nhave always done everything in reverse, inverting the\nconvention of releasing an album and then touring it.\nMany of the singles from FTFT were toured for years\nbefore studio release and were dropped from live sets\nas soon as the band began touring again after FTFT,\nbeing replaced by new and ever-evolving tracks that\nwould eventually form AFUT. In fact, the band do\nnot even consider FTFT their debut album, but rather\na collection of songs from their early days, indicating\nhow far detached they are from it now. With Wood\u2019s\ndeparture, it is likely that all the songs on AFUT will\nalso never be toured again.\nWithin seconds of AFUT it is clear how separated\nBC,NR have become from their early days. \u2018Intro\u2019 is\nnotably different from the \u2018Instrumental\u2019 of FTFT,\nbeing a joyous 54-second-long track that explodes into\nthe anthemic \u2018Chaos Space Marine\u2019, in contrast to the\n5-minute long angsty introductory track for FTFT.\nImmediately, you can hear the joy from the band that\nthey are playing and releasing music in a genre that they\nwant to be, and are more proud of.\n\u2018Chaos Space Marine\u2019 is the most whimsical and\nupbeat song on the album, sounding almost like a\nfunfair theme. I was hesitant when I first listened\nto the track, which was the first single released from\nthe album. The short track was a bold change from\nthe BC,NR I loved, but in the context of the album I\nunderstand why the band describe it as the \u201cbest song\n[they have] ever written\u201d. In three minutes, the band are\nable to establish their new style. A more euphoric and\njoyous BC,NR are introduced, with the sound taking\ninspiration from klezmer and virtuosic free-jazz. The\nwhirlwind jazz of FTFT is gone, replaced with a sound\nthat is more cohesive, despite the fact it shouldn\u2019t be\non paper. The instrumentation is more varied, the\nunconventional song structures remain, the rhythms\nand time signatures are chaotic, but unlike FTFT\nwhere these features could leave you whiplashed and\nleft behind, AFUT manages to fuse ideas together in a\nway that carries the listener alongside them.\nThe pop culture references in Wood\u2019s lyrics remain,\ncleverly used as a guise for more complex issues.\n\u2018Chaos Space Marine\u2019 is a Warhammer reference after\nall, with the song describing a narrator who obsesses\nover the game as a distraction from their failing\nrelationship. At its core, that is what AFUT is about: a\nco-dependent relationship that the narrator is in denial\nof, and their deep emotional turmoil. Throughout\nthe album it becomes more difficult to decipher how\nthe relationship is being described \u2013 whether it is a\nromantic one, or whether it is the relationship between\nartist and audience.\n\u2018Concorde\u2019 begins as a gentler, waltz-like piece, that\ngrows into an eruptive anthem as the cohesion at the\nstart of the track disintegrates into chaos, whilst the\nlyrics move from metaphorical imagery to plainer\nlanguage tainted with despair (\u201cI was made to love you\n/ Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d). It also introduces the motif of the\nConcorde supersonic jet, a project by the British and\nFrench governments that was a failure and far exceeded\nbudget but was not abandoned due to the amount of\nmoney already funnelled in and lost to the project. The\nother person in the narrator\u2019s relationship is described\nas the \u201cConcorde\u201d, which is used as a metaphor for a\nromantic sunken-cost fallacy in a failing relationship.\nThe motif of the Concorde jet reoccurs throughout the\nalbum as a representation for the failing relationship.\n\u2018Bread Song\u2019 is a quiet and contemplative moment\non the album, taking inspiration from Steve Reich, that\nexploresone-sidednessinarelationship,andintroduces\nthe feeling of melancholy that later pervades the album.\nThe idea of dependency in a relationship is continued\non the next track, \u2018Good Will Hunting\u2019, which is the\nmost conventional and accessible song on the album,\nbeginning as a conventional pop-rock tune that soon\ndescends into dissonance and unconventional song\nstructures.\nIt is at this point, halfway through the album that the\ntone shifts into a mood that is much more emotive and\npainful. The hopefulness and triumph from the start of\nthe album is gone, and the songs become heavier and\nmore heart-breaking. The second half of the album is\none I find difficult to listen to, despite how much I love\nit - \u2018Haldern\u2019 is a track that is almost too agonising.\nIt gives a feeling of heaviness at the bottom of your\nstomach, and the weight on your chest that makes it\nhard to get out of bed in the morning. The feeling of\nsadness it imparts is so all-encompassing that it is hard\nto encapsulate with words.\n\u2018Mark\u2019s Theme\u2019 is a quiet change of pace, a loving\ninstrumental dedication to saxophonist Lewis Evan\u2019s\nuncle who was a big supporter of the band. It begins\nwith a heartfelt unaccompanied heartfelt tenor\nsaxophone solo, that is later joined by quiet piano and\nviolin, before going into audio of Mark singing. It is a\nhauntingly beautiful dedication to the influence that\nMark had on Evans, and how that outstretched to the\nrest of the band.\n\u2018The Place Where He Inserted The Blade\u2019 is my\nBlack Country, New Road\u2019s sophomore album, Ants from Up There, confirms their place as one of the best bands around in a long time\nSingle cover: \u201cSnow Globe\u201d Single cover: \u201cConcorde\u201d Single cover: \u201cBread Song\u201d\n\n"

Whether you enjoy a\ngood story and haven\u2019t got enough time on your hands\nfor a novel (perks of being an Imperial student!) or\naren\u2019t into books but want to take a productive break\nfrom the tedium of your MS Teams meetings, Imperial alumnus Adam Kay\u2019s accessible writing caters to\neveryone\u2019s literary needs. The fragmented nature of\nthe diary liberates readers from commitment, and as a\nbonus, a TV adaptation starring Ben Wishaw has just\naired its first episode on BBC One this week (on Tuesday 8th February), perfect for those of us who can\u2019t\nquite find the time or focus to read an entire book.\nContaining a carefully curated plethora of anecdotes plucked straight from the diary of a junior\ndoctor, \u2018This is Going to Hurt\u2019 is a poignant and\nintrospective insight into the daily life of an NHS\nmedic. Adam Kay details his journey post-med school,\nnavigating the ins and outs of numerous hospitals\nwhile climbing the ranks from \u2018House Officer\u2019 to\n\u2018Senior Registrar\u2019. His tales of medical maladies range\nfrom hilarious to heartbreaking, and each is told with\na sense of pride and just a little sarcasm.\nAs it describes the medical world and everyday\nexperiences of a doctor, this may seem like a heavy\nread, but each journal entry details Kay\u2019s cases with\nwelcome simplicity and a hint of humorous absurdity.\nAlthough he is no longer a practicing doctor, his\npassion for the career and belief in its nobility is\ninspirational even for those of us who would never\neven consider pursuing medicine. He relates to the\nreader an occasion on which he was asked to return\nto his old school for a careers event. To the few students who showed interest in medicine, he decided\nto reveal the grittier aspects of the profession, rather\nthan simply advertising the glamorous, idealistic\nversion.\nIf stories from the Covid pandemic haven\u2019t yet\nmanaged to convince you that the life of an NHS\nemployee is tough and grueling, Kay\u2019s recounts of\nworking 100+ hour weeks and being underpaid in\nhospitals that are severely understaffed definitely\nwill. His slightly graphic albeit technical descriptions of pregnancy, labour, and delivery could also\nput any sane woman off having a child of her own.\nDespite all that, he encourages us that he wouldn\u2019t\nhave had it any other way.\nAs incredible and funny as Kay\u2019s stories are, they\nalso bestow the reader with a greater empathy for\ndoctors and other health professionals, not just in the\nUK\u2019s NHS but all over the world. It provides ample\njustification for the sometimes-restrained and unsympathetic nature of medics, and garners appreciation\nfor those that do show their patience and compassion\nto patients. Put in their position, how many of us\nwould have the strength of character to return to such\na taxing occupation, and how soon would we reach\nour own personal breaking point?\nAdam Kay\u2019s brilliant narration paired with the gravity of his subject matter will ensure you stay hooked\nwith every turn of a page. If you only read one book\nthis week or month or even this year, make it this one.\nI promise you won\u2019t regret it.\nThis Is Going To Hurt\nBook Reviews\nZanna Buckland Books Editor\nFRIDAY 11TH FEBRUARY 2022\nTwas The Nightshift Before Christmas\nThis review is slightly\noverdue given that\nover a month has passed\nsince Christmas and\nNew Year\u2019s. Kay\u2019s second\nbook follows much the\nsame format as the first\nbut focusing on the six\nChristmases and New\nYears\u2019 in a row that he\nspent traipsing up and\ndown hospital wards.\nHe speculates that this\nsomewhat unfortunate\narrangement arose due to spending each year training\nin a different hospital, and to his being Jewish.\nIt\u2019s a compelling read whether or not you\u2019re still\nfeeling festive, delving into the ridiculous antics\ninduced by Yuletide fever and the emotional burdens\nof having to spend the winter holidays as an inpatient\nor a medic. Being shorter and more subject-specific, it\nis arguably more lighthearted than the previous title,\nthough not without its own touching moments.\nInterspersed between perplexing stories of festive\nitems being stuck in places they definitely shouldn\u2019t\nbe are forlorn anecdotes about telling his significant\nother and family members he won\u2019t be available for\nyet another holiday gathering and bringing Christmas\nlunch to work in Tupperware boxes.\nThis particular title also makes a good gift for a\nfriend or family member, and - if you manage to remember it until Christmas comes round again - a great\nstocking filler due to its compactness. It\u2019s small enough\nthat even the hardback version can fit neatly into a\nbag or large pocket. If you enjoyed reading the first\nbook, give this one a go too. The holiday season seems\nto start earlier each year anyway, so why not add some\nChristmas spirit to your spring reading list?\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 11TH FEBRURY 2022\n31\nSport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nThis past fortnight has been an incredible show of athleticism. The\nAustralian Open tennis tournament was\nheld in Melbourne, marking its 50th an-niversary. Every game watched was a feat\nof athleticism that some of us can only\ndream of. There were many, many games\nplayed over the course\nof the two weeks, how-ever, the ones I want to\ntalk about, of course,\nare the finals. Specifically, four of the finals.\nNow, I may be a little\nbiased when writing\nthis article because\nthere is no coincidence\nthat three of these four\nfinals had Australian\ntennis players, and being a proud Aussie, I\njust had to talk about\nthem. But I can say,\nwithout bias, that these were also incredible games.\nThe first of these finals, and one of\nthe most touching finals that I have ever\nwatched, was the men\u2019s wheelchair quad\nsingles. The final was between Australian legend Dylan Alcott, winner of 15\nGrand Slams, and Sam Schroder, a very\nyoung but already successful Dutch tennis player. Alcott had recently defeated\nSchroderinthefinaloftheTokyoOlympics. In a very tough final, Sam Schroder\ncame out on top, with a 7-5, 6-0 victo-ry. It was such an impactful game, with\nhuge viewing numbers, that the channel\nshowcasing the game held all news off\nfor the entirety of the game.\nThis was Dylan Alcott\u2019s final Australian open appearance. All of Australia has\nloved to watch him play tennis and be\nan advocate for people with disabilities\naround the world. A couple of days prior to the final event, on Australia Day,\nAlcott was named \u201cAustralian of the\nYear\u201d, the first Australian with a disability to win this award, demonstrating\nthe impact he has had on Australia and\nthe wider community. \u201cThis was my purpose,\u201d Alcott told Tennis Australia, \u201cTo\nchange perceptions so that people with\ndisabilities could live the lives they deserve to live, and I really wanted to get\ngreater representation for athletes with\ndisabilities.\u201d I think I speak for everyone when I say both of these men have\ndefinitely fulfilled this purpose. If you\ndo get a chance, out of all\nthese finals, please watch\nthis one. Just as Alcott\nsays, para-sports don\u2019t get\nthe recognition they de-serve, so watch this final,\nand see the high level of\nperformance displayed in\nthis sport.\nThe second final I\nwant to talk about is the\nWomen\u2019s Singles Final.\nAshleigh Barty (or as we\nall call her, Ash) played\nAmerican tennis player\nDaniella Collins in the final. Collins\nplayed fantastically, with incredible\npower and agility throughout the game,\nhowever, Ash Barty won the game, 6-3,\n7-6. I have never seen anyone play like\nAsh. She was so calm and composed\nthroughout the whole game! We almost\nnever see any emotion at all, no disappointment or pride, she is so completely focused. This probably makes it even\nmore special when she won the final and\ncheered and showed so much emotion;\nwe all couldn\u2019t help but smile! She is the\nfirst Australian to win the Australian\nOpen since 1987. She is a proud Aboriginal (Kooyong) woman, so it was even\nmore special to have the trophy awarded to her by Evonne Goolagong Cawley,\ntheAustralianformerworldNo.1player\nand Australian of the Year in 1971, and\nthe first aboriginal woman to win the\nAustralian open. Ash has made all of\nAustralia proud and we all can\u2019t wait to\nwatch her continued successes.\nAfter Ash Barty\u2019s beautiful win, the\nmen\u2019s doubles final was on, with a guaranteed Australian win with both teams\nbeing fully Aussie: The M\u2019s (Matthew\nEbden and Max Purcell) versus the Special K\u2019s (Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick\nKyrgios). I sadly didn\u2019t get to watch\nmany of the previous games the M\u2019s\nplayed in, but based on the final, they\ndeserved every win! They had fantastic\nchemistry together and read each other\nsowell,withsomebeautifulvolleysatthe\nnet. The Special K\u2019s on the other hand, I\nhad watched quite a few of their games.\nThey have some of the best personalities\nI have ever seen. They played each game\nwith so much happiness and excitement\nand passion, and the entire crowd was always rooting for them (of course, them\nbeingAustralianmighthavehelpedwith\nthat, but their personality definitely\nwent a long way). The crowd loves them,\nand they play up to it! In the end, the\nSpecial K\u2019s did win, 7-5, 6-4, with each\nside struggling to break the other\u2019s serve.\nMax Purcell has won previous tourna-ments, we know his career isn\u2019t over yet,\nand Matthew Ebden, at only the age of\n23, has a very bright future ahead of him\nin the world of tennis. In addition, we\nhope to see more of the Special K\u2019s special chemistry in future\ntournaments: our fingers are crossed.\nThe final game I\nwant to talk about is\nthe men\u2019s single. Even\nif you didn\u2019t watch the\nAustralian Open, I am\nsure you heard about\nthis game. The final\nwas between 25 year-old Daniil Medvedev and 36 year-old Rafael Nadal,\ntwo incredibly talented and matched\nplayers. Medvedev had a fantastic start\nto the game, absolutely dominating the\nfirst two sets. We all thought that would\nbe the end of the game, with Medvedev having a predicted 94% chance of\nwinning after the second set. However,\nNadal managed to break his serve in\nthe third set, winning it 6-4. There still\nwasn\u2019t a lot of hope for Nadal to win, but\nit was definitely more than at the end of\nthe second set. And somehow, yet again,\nNadal managed to win the fourth set 6-4\nas well. This is after 4 hours of playing in\ntheAustralianSummerheat;Icanbarely\nwalk from the garage to the house without sweat pouring off me and struggling\ntobreathe,soIcannotevenimaginehow\nexhausted they must have been. Finally,\nthe fifth set came, and we were all holding our breath. Most of the stadium was\nrooting for Nadal; if he won this tourna-ment,hewouldmakehistorybywinning\n21 Grand Slams, surpassing Federer and\nDjokovic. When the set tied 5-5, five\nand a half hours in, firstly, we couldn\u2019t\nbelieve the incredible game we all had\nalready witnessed, and secondly, we\nhad no idea where the game would go.\nSomehow, through all the exhaustion,\nNadal won the next two games, winning\nhis second Australian Open and making\nhistory. The game was nothing short of\nincredible, with some of the most athletic abilities I have ever seen: 205km/h\nserves consistently throughout the five\nand a half hours, forty shot rallies, constant back and forwards sprinting as if\nthey hadn\u2019t been running more than I\never have in my life\u2026 the list goes on and\non. Medvedev will become an incredibly well known player\nand might become one\nof the greats. But Nadal\nwill always be remembered in history, not\njust as one of the greats,\nbut possibly the greatest tennis player to have\never been.\nEvery tennis Grand\nSlam event is absolutely brilliant, but as\nanAussie,theAustralianOpenhasaspe-cial place in my heart, so it was lovely to\nbe able to watch the success in this tour-nament. I have the utmost admiration\nfor every single one of the tennis players during the tournament, their dedication and love for the sport was seen\nthroughout, and their mental strength is\nsomething special. I am looking forward\nto the Winter Olympics starting in the\nnext few days to see even more incredible feats of sport!\nAmanda Barden Sport Editor\nThe Austalian Open\nEVERY GAME\nWATCHED\nWAS A FEAT OF\nATHLETICISM\nTHAT SOME OF\nUS CAN ONLY\nDREAM OF\n\u201c\nTHE CROWD\nLOVES THEM,\nAND THEY\nPLAY UP TO\nIT!\n\u201c\nIf you didn\u2019t catch it, here are some of the highlights!\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n26\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nUnpacking the Spotify Mutiny: What on Earth is Going\nOn With Neil Young and Joe Rogan?\nWritten by Tara Pal Chaudhuri Music Editor\nNeil Young released a statement in January criticising Spotify for \u201cunfactual, misleading and\nfalse COVID information\u201d that the platform has hosted unchecked, particularly pointing at content produced by podcaster and comedian,\nJoe Rogan. Rogan interviews a variety of people on his show with the\nintention of learning more about the\nworld around him \u2013 a stance he has\nmade very clear. That means that in\nconversation with \u201cspecialists\u201d (who\nhave been criticised by the scientific\ncommunity), he was able to comfortably make statements about the\nnature of the COVID-19 vaccine.\nNot only has he stated that young,\nhealthy people should avoid getting\njabbed, but that the vaccine is actually \u201cgene therapy\u201d. \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d reels\nin 12 million views a month and is tied to Spotify\nwith an exclusive $100 million licensing deal. Despite\nRogan\u2019s obvious monetary leverage, Young posed an\nultimatum to Spotify, \u201cthey can have either Rogan or\nYoung. Not both.\u201d This rebellion has since snowballed\nfor a variety of reasons, supported by both musicians,\nlike Joni Mitchell, Nils Lofgren, and Mary Trump, and\ncontent-producers. However, it raises a few questions\nabout censorship, creative rights, and the nature of the\nstreaming era.\nOf all that remains on Spotify of the late 60s folk\nrock bands, CSN (Crosby, Stills & Nash) and CSNY\n(Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young), are a few live albums\nthat I doubt anyone pays much attention to. However,\nDavid Crosby has specifically received\nbacklash for supporting Young because he sold\nhis entire catalogue to Iconic Artists\u2019 Group\nover a year ago, limiting the actual agency he\nhas over his music. As a result, he and his ex-bandmates have been criticised for their 60s\u2019\npseudo-revolutionary \u201chippy\u201d outlook that\nsays much more than it does. While the impact\nof late 60s rock on protesting the Vietnam\nWar is hard to quantify, who better to start\na revolt against Spotify than Neil Young and\nhis grumpy flower power companions? They\nhit the peak of their success decades earlier\nand their biggest fans tend to have their music\non vinyl or CD, making them, arguably, the\nperfect musicians to start and support a cause\nagainst a music streaming service. And while\nthey are definitely not the designated voices\nof science in our society, it\u2019s painfully obvious\nthat the 270 American doctors and science\nprofessionals who wrote an open letter to\nSpotify criticising misinformation in Rogan\u2019s podcast\ndidn\u2019t gain half the traction Neil Young did.\nBut that brings us to the next question: is Spotify\njust a music-streaming service anymore? Many argue\nthat the first step towards it\ntaking responsibility for the\ncontent on the platform is\nsimply recognising the fact it is\nan exclusive content platform \u2013\nexemplified by \u201cThe Joe Rogan\nExperience\u201d. This changes the\nrole Spotify plays in the content\nthat is available on the website.\nDespite the fact that Spotify\u2019s\nCEO, Daniel Ek, has made it\nincredibly clear that he finds\n\u201csome of Joe Rogan\u2019s comments\nincredibly hurtful\u201d, he still\nwanted to clarify that \u201cthey do not represent the values\nof this company\u201d. This was, of course, still followed by\nthe removal of 113 episodes of the podcast after a video\ncompilation of Rogan using racial slurs went viral.\nHowever, this rebellion against Spotify has its own\nconsequences: we\u2019re one step closer to validating cancel\nculture. Artists like India.arie have decided to remove\ntheir content from Spotify not only to counter vaccine\nmisinformation, but because they have a very particular\nbone to pick with Joe Rogan \u2013 his racial insensitivity.\nA mind-numbing conversation resurfaced between\nJoe Rogan and an interviewee about why Black people\nare called \u201cblack\u201d despite not actually being \u201cblack\u201d,\nadding fuel to the fire. But despite how despicable it\nis, is it really wise for criticism to accumulate and then\nfall on an entertainer all at once, or perhaps steadily\nmake itself known to the entertainer? Daniel Ek also\nagrees that there isn\u2019t much use \u201csilencing\u201d Joe Rogan\nand that \u201ccancelling voices is a slippery slope\u201d, instead\nemphasising the need to have \u201cclear lines around\ncontent\u201d. Spotify has since added a content advisory to\npodcast episodes that discuss COVID-19 so that users\ncan be redirected to a verified resource. Of course, this\nmakes sense if users actively decide to click on it and\nignore the statements of a podcaster they listen to so\nfervently.\nWhile Joe Rogan was the reason behind the\ncontroversy, the recent musical exodus from Spotify\nwas helped in large part by Spotify itself. Artists like\nFailure have taken the opportunity to call Spotify out\non their \u201cdraconian royalty calculation which gives\nartists a microscopic fraction of money being generated\non their platform\u201d. A lot of this money, in fact, probably\nwentintothatenviable$100millionlicensingdealwith\nRogan. In case you might be wondering \u201cif not Spotify,\nthen what?\u201d, then you\u2019re asking a difficult question\nin the wrong era. Music streaming platforms have\nmade music accessible and cheap, which also means\nthat some artists can barely buy a cup of coffee from\ntheir earnings. The ethically-sound solution would be\nto purchase high-quality downloadable music from\nplatforms like Bandcamp, but realistically, very few\npeople would be willing to do that.\nWhile this rekindles the peripheral debate on\ncensorship, one has to give a thought to the measures\nthat need to be taken to separate opinion and scientific\nfact. Influencers often feel the need to hold an opinion\nabout everything under the sun, even if it\u2019s half-informed, or in this case, completely unqualified.\nRegardless, we must reorient our approach to these\ncommentators and perhaps shift our focus to the\nplatforms or algorithms that are purveyors of this kind\nof entertainment.\n\u201c\nTHE RECENT\nMUSICAL EXODUS\nFROM SPOTIFY\nWAS HELPED IN\nLARGE PART BY\nSPOTIFY ITSELF.\nWhen Neil Young removed his music from Spotify due to allegations that Joe Rogan was spreading vaccine disinformation on his widely viewed podcast, did\nhe launch a losing battle against the music-streaming platform?\n\n"

This reorganisation\u2013much like the renovation of The Julia and\nHans Rausing Room (room 32) the year before\u2013has\ngiven the central foyer area a breath of fresh exuberance and grandeur as you head into the gallery.\nNow, Gainsborough\u2019s The Blue Boy, the lost \u2018National Treasure\u2019 that made its way to the New World\n(sold to Huntington Gallery) a hundred years back\nto the date, sits adjacent in the temporary exhibition\nroom (Room 1). Masked by 4 paintings (two on each\nside) of his fellow compatriot Joshua Reynolds and inspiration Van Dyck, the exhibition is rooting to pull all\nfocus on Gainsborough\u2019s boy.

In a sense,\ndespite the lack of a traditional exhibition narrative in\nthis small \u2018single painting\u2019 exhibition, the layout lends\nitself perfectly well to elevate the exhibition to feel like\nit is telling a story of more than one room, more than\none artist, and more than one milieu!\nGainsborough adored Van Dyck. Painstakingly reproducing over 40 of Van Dyck\u2019s work in a search to\nemulate the great Dutch portraiture master and find\nsimilar patronage in England. Much like Turner\u2019s obsession with Claude, this was one of reverence and a\nlot of catch-up in the beginning! Van Dyck, a pupil of\nRembrandts\u2019 school, revolutionised portraiture and\nenjoyed unparalleled appeal in Britain.\nIt is thus no surprise that elements of this painting,\ntouted as Gainsborough\u2019s most popular work, are borrowed heavily from Van Dyck. Much has been made\nof the blue colour of the garment and the strong red\nbackground. Running against the grain of contemporary portraiture techniques, these elements are incorporated masterfully with both a touch of reverence to\nVan Dyck (who adored the garment and the colour, repeatedly using it in his own work) and as statement of\nconfidencetotheacademy!Thispainting,inthatsense,\nwas much more a statement than it was a piece of art.\nYears of perfecting the Old Master \u2014 and finally delivering his chef d\u2019oeuvre.\nThe frame is as elaborate and eye catchy as the paint-ing.

The\nrecipient Jim Parsons, 57, had been\ndeclared officially dead following a\nsevere head injury during a motorcycle\nrace. With his family\u2019s blessing,\nJim was kept alive on a ventilator so\nthat researchers could perform the\nexperiment just four days later. With\nhis blood still circulating, his own\nkidneys were removed, and replaced\nwith the genetically engineered pig\nkidneys.\nWhy can we not use\nordinary animal organs?\nOn average, 20 people die every day\non the transplant waiting list. However,\nunder normal conditions, pig organs\ncannot be transplanted directly into\nhumans. There are three main obstacles\npreventing pig-to-human transplants\n(xenotransplantation):\n(1) Risk of rejection by the immune\nsystem\n(2) Potential transmission of cross-species infections\n(3) Ethical concerns.\nThis is why the historic experiment\non Jim Parsons is \u201ca major milestone in\nthe field of xenotransplantation, which\nis arguably the best solution to the\norgan shortage crisis,\u201d according to lead\nsurgeon Dr Jayme Locke, director of the\nComprehensive Transplant Institute\nat the UAB. \u201cWe have bridged critical\nknowledge gaps and obtained the safety\nand feasibility data necessary to begin a\nclinical trial in living humans with end-stage kidney failure disease.\u201d\nWhat makes this\nexperiment different?\nLocke\u2019steamisthefirsttotesttherapies\nin brain dead people. The experiment\nrelating to Jim Parsons, now termed the\nParsons model, was developed to test\nthe safety and feasibility of using pig\norgans in preparation for clinical trials.\nThiscouldbeanalternativewhentesting\non animals is insufficient. Normally,\npig organs are too different to human\norgans, so they cannot be transplanted\nas they are rejected by the human\nimmune system even if people are\ntaking drugs to suppress their immune\nsystem. However, new pigs have been\ngenetically modified by the US firm\nRevivicor and designed to prevent\nrejection, using CRISPR, a gene-editing\ntechnique (see information panel).\nThepigkidneysprovidedbyRevivicor\ncame from a 13-month-old male pig and\nhadundergone10geneeditsbyCRISPR,\nwhich switched off four genes, including\ngenesinvolvedinrejectionbythehuman\nimmune system. Additionally, the\npig\u2019s genes had six human genes added.\nBefore transplant, the cross-matching\nprocess took place. This was where the\nbloodfromthedonorpigandMrParsons\nwere mixed together to ensure that,\nwhen transplanted, his immune cells\nwould not attack the pig\u2019s cells. The new\npig kidneys were then transplanted into\nMr Parsons, using the same connections\nas his original kidneys. During the 77-hour experiment, the pig kidneys were\nnot rejected, and within 23 minutes the\nfirst kidney to be transplanted began\nto produce urine. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable\nachievement. We had a beautiful pink\nkidney, not one that turned black from\nhyperacute rejection,\u201d said Dr Locke.\nThe experiment was stopped once Mr\nParsons could not be maintained on\nmechanical support any longer.\nLorena Mejias Martinez Science Writer\nCould this be the answer to organ shortages?\nEdited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nGenetically modified pig kidneys\ntransplanted into brain-dead patient\nCRISPR (pronounced \u201ccrisper\u201d) is a powerful tool which allows scientists to\nedit genes. The process is very simple: once you find a specific region of DNA,\nthe CRISPR-Cas system will then alter the piece of DNA. Cas are \u2018CRISPRassociated proteins\u2019, which are proteins found in bacteria that are used to\ndestroy viral DNA. The most important is Cas9, an enzyme which can be given\na piece of RNA (a simpler, single stranded form of DNA, which carries genetic\ninformation), which acts as a guide and takes Cas9 to find its target sequence in\nthe DNA of a target cell. Cas9 then acts as a pair of molecular scissors, where it\ncutsthetargetsequenceout.Now,whenthemissingpieceofDNAgetsrepaired,\nit usually inserts a mutation which disables the gene. Although this is the most\ncommon use for CRISPR, it can also be used for true genome editing. That is,\nmaking exact changes in the DNA sequence, but this is much more difficult.\nCRISPR has revolutionized science since its invention in 2012, allowing\nfor the treatment of many different\ndiseases. However, the power to edit\ngeneshasraisedsomeethicalissues.The\npotentialtoeditthegenomeofchildren\nusing CRIPSR exists and in 2018, this\nwas attempted by biophysicist He\nJianku in China, who was sentenced\nto three years in prison for \u201cillegal\nmedicine practice\u201d. Although this has\nbeen deemed unethical, some people\nbelieve gene-editing using CRISPR\ncould be used to prevent diseases\nin children before they are born.\nEXPLAINER\nWHAT IS CRISPR?\nConclusions\nOverall, the surgeons concluded\nthat the experiment was a success and\nit shows potential for progression into\nclinical trials. \u201cThe goal is not to only\nhelp one person, but to help everybody,\u201d\nsaid Dr Locke.\nDespite these positive results, getting\ngenetically modified pig organs is still\nextremely difficult. Some scientists\nbelieve experiments should focus on\nclinical trials, as opposed to experiments\non brain-dead patients. \u201cWhat we\nreally want to know is will the pig\nkidneys function for a year,\u201d said Dr\nCooper, from Massachusetts General.\nHe believes the only way to truly see\nif using animal organs is a potential\nsolution is to transplant organs into\nliving patients. However, the Parsons\nexperiment may allow for FDA approval\nfor clinical trials and is a historic step\nforward in the field of transplantation.\n\u201cA radical solution is needed for\nthe organ supply crisis\u201d, said Dr Locke.\nCredits: Karolina Wilgus\n\n"

    "content": "It has been just over 50 years since\nMilton Friedman famously coined\nthe phrase, \u201cThe business of business\nis business\u201d. Today, this statement no\nlonger holds true. In a world where the\ndevastating effects of climate change, social inequality, ecological degradation,\nand socio-political instability ensue,\nperhaps more than ever before, businesses hold immense power to determine\nthe direction in which our society is\npropelled: to destruction or salvation.\nThere have been rapid developments\ninjustthelastfewdecadeswhenitcomes\ntobusinessestacklinghumanity\u2019sbiggest\nproblems. What initially began as acts of\nCSR (corporate social responsibility),\nsuch as philanthropy, has now led to the\nrise of companies that live and breathe\npositive social and environmental\nimpact, like Patagonia, for example.\nToday, there\u2019s a growing movement of\nbusinesses proactively taking a stand on\ncontemporary issues, whether driven\nby consumers, investors or NGOs.\nOne company at the forefront of this\nmovement is Unilever. Led by then-CEO Paul Polman, the multinational\nconglomerate that sells anything from\nBen & Jerry\u2019s to Dove soap bars has set\nitself apart since 2009 by ambitiously\nwalkingthewalkofputtingpurposeatthe\ncore of its business. Major undertakings\nsuch as the Unilever Sustainable Living\nPlan are just the tip of the iceberg when\nit comes to the numerous environmental\nand social commitments made by the\ncompany. But as with most things that\ngo against the status quo, this approach\nto business is not without its critics.\nTheriseofinitiativesliketheTaskforce\non Climate-change related Financial\nDisclosures (in which businesses\nquantify the financial risks they face\nfrom climate-change-related risks),\nor ESG (Environmental, Social, and\nGovernance), has spread like wildfire\nin the last few years, giving reasons for\noptimism. Yet the water is still murky\nwhen it comes to answering whether\nputting environmental and social\npurpose at the centre of a business comes\nat the cost of business performance.\nNothing highlighted this as clearly\nas the recent news of Terry Smith,\none of Unilever\u2019s top shareholders,\nopenly criticizing the business.\nTriggered by the rejection of\nUnilever\u2019s bids for the consumer health\ndivision of pharmaceutical company\nGSK, Smith took a stab to highlight\nthe company\u2019s underperforming share\nprices, blaming it on their focus on\npurpose. He sarcastically stated in his\nannual letter to CEOs, \u201cA company\nwhich feels it has to define the purpose\nof Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise has in\nour view clearly lost the plot. The\nHellmann\u2019s brand has existed since\n1913, so we would guess that by now\nconsumers have figured out its purpose\n(spoiler alert \u2014 salads and sandwiches).\u201d\nMoreover, he stated that \u201cUnilever\nseems to be labouring under the weight\nof a management which is obsessed\nwith publicly displaying sustainability\ncredentials at the expense of focusing\non the fundamentals of the business.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s interpretation of Unilever as a\nbusiness that has gotten stuck in its own\nhead of a utopian business ecosystem\nmay not be his alone. Public statements\nlike this that have captured the attention\nof various news outlets, including\nthe Financial Times, may ripple\ngreater scepticism over environmental\nor social-driven businesses\namongst the investor community.\nBut that same week, another\nLetter to CEOs echoed the complete\nopposite. Written by Larry Fink, CEO\nof BlackRock, this letter was widely\npicked up by media outlets\u2014perhaps\nmost notably for the fact that it used\nthe word \u2018purpose\u2019 as many times as it\nreferred to \u2018profit\u2019. Fink stated \u2018In this\npolarized world, CEOs will invariably\nhave one set of stakeholders demanding\nthat we do one thing, while another\nset of stakeholders demand that we\ndo just the opposite. That is why it is\nmore important than ever that your\ncompany and its management be guided\nby its purpose. If you stay true to your\ncompany\u2019s purpose and focus on the\nlong-term, while adapting to this new\nworldaroundus,youwilldeliverdurable\nreturns for shareholders and help realize\nthe power of capitalism for all.\u201d In this\nview, companies like Unilever would\nmake a stellar example of a business with\npurpose. Indeed, Fink went further on\nto state that \u201cWe focus on sustainability\nnot because we\u2019re environmentalists, but\nbecause we are capitalists and fiduciaries\nto our clients.\u201d\u2014highlighting that\nconcern for the environment is not just\na nice-to-have element of a business\nbut that it is a necessary component\nof long-term economic return.\nThepolarisedviewsdisplayedbysome\nof the leaders in business highlight just\nhow complex, frustrating, and exciting\nthe role of a business has become. Must a\ncompany be driven solely by purpose to\ngenerate profit? Or does a firm focusing\nonpurposedomoreharmthangoodifits\ninvestorsarenolongerwillingtosupport\ntheir operations?

    "content": "Meta:A Record-Breaking Single-Day Loss\nA bad week for Zuckerberg indeed....\nThe concept of Metaverse refers to a persistent and shared three-dimensional virtual reality space where users can interact with each other in a computer-generated environment, offering a hyper-real alternative world. Rudimentary forms of the Metaverse already exists in games such as Minecraft, Roblox and Fortnite,\nbut Meta\u2019s Metaverse is likely to be released in 10-15 years\u2019 time.\nTHE \u2018METAVERSE\u2019... WHAT IS THAT?\nAnna Fu\nWriter // Senior Analyst, Energy & Utilities\nWhy is Meta facing serious issues at the moment? Our\nwriter, Anna Fu discusses a list of possible reasons.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n28 Investment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Ahmad Danesh\nInvestment Investment Society\nImperial College London\nOn the 3rd of February, Meta\n(previously known as Facebook),\nsaw a whopping 26.4% decrease in its\nstock price, dropping from $323.00 to $244.98. This\nrepresents more than $250 billion being wiped off the\nmarket capitalisation of Meta. The sudden plummet\nhas also set a record for the largest single-day trading\nloss ever occurred on a US stock exchange.\nWhat was the reason behind the record-breaking stock\nmarket loss? The crash could be attributed to Meta\nmissing Q1 forecasts of $30 billion by merely reaching\nthe range of $27 to $29 billion. Meta\u2019s revenue\nis mainly driven by advertisements on Facebook,\nInstagram, and the Meta Family of Apps; these\nadvertisements account for 97% of Meta\u2019s revenue. The\nremaining 3% of revenue originates from the Reality\nLabs division \u2013 the creators behind Metaverse. Since\nthe Reality Labs division only accounts for a small\nfraction of Meta\u2019s revenue, issues such as declining\ndaily users, privacy issues, and shifting focus onto the\nMetaverse all contribute to the dip in revenue.\nDaily Users falling\nThe number of Daily Active Users (DAU) fell from\n1.930 billion in Q3 to 1.929 billion users in Q4. This\nis the first time in history that the number of daily\nusers was not growing but declining. This could be\nattributed to users\u2019 changing engagement \u2013 instead of\nconsuming content in the form of posts and pictures,\nusers are consuming more short videos. This is\nproblematic to Meta in two ways: firstly, short videos\ngenerate less revenue from advertisements compared to\nthe traditional format that Meta follows and secondly,\nTikTok, which provides short video content only,\npresents intense competition for user\u2019s time. Moreover,\nthe different demographics for TikTok and the Meta\nFamily of Apps underpin the dwindling number of\nusers. The Forrester survey conducted in 2021 showed\nthat TikTok usage surpassed Instagram amongst those\naged 12 to 17, suggesting that the Meta Family of Apps\nis no longer the go-to social media for the younger\ngeneration.\nCompetitors\nHow is TikTok more addictive compared to Meta?\nTikTok has a more effective AI engagement algorithm\n\u2013 the algorithm aims to maximise the amount of time\nusers spend on the app. It uses user interactions, such\nas videos you have added to your favourites, videos that\nyou have watched all the way to the end and account\nsettings, such as your country settings, language\npreferences, to generate a unique \u201cfor you\u201d page that\nis separate from the user\u2019s interests. This provides\ndiversity in its content recommendation and is in stark\ncontrast with the algorithms used by the Meta Family\nof Apps which recommend content similar to what the\nusers have previously expressed interest in. The lack of\ndiversity and neverending content recommendations\nkeeps users in their echo chambers, and underlies why\nusers are increasingly shifting away from the Meta\nFamily of Apps. The drop in DAU then translates to a\ndrop in revenue.\nPrivacy Issues\nThe second reason behind the drop in earnings\ncould be traced back to software privacy changes.\nIn April 2021, Apple introduced the App Tracking\nTransparency policy which mandates apps, such as\nMeta, to ask for the user\u2019s permission before tracking\nactivity across apps and websites, which made it more\ndifficult to use personal data to target advertisements.\nThis has had a substantial impact on Meta, as its\nbusiness model relies heavily on collecting users\u2019\ninformation and selling them to advertisers. Therefore,\nthe change in software privacy contributed to the drop\nin revenue.\nAnother privacy issue Meta faces is the invalidation\nof the \u2018Privacy Shield\u2019 arrangement between Europe\nand the United States; the arrangement has previously\nenabled companies to transfer personal data from the\nEuropean Union and Switzerland to the United States.\nHowever, since the arrangement is no longer in place,\ncurrent EU regulations prevent Meta from transferring\ndata, which is a crucial part of generating revenue. If\nMeta withdraws from the European market, Meta will\nmiss out on $6.8 billion of advertising revenue a year,\nfurther exacerbating the drop in revenue.\nFocus on the Metaverse\nThe trend of declining advertisement revenue and the\nmaturation of Meta\u2019s business has driven it to pivot\nto the Reality Labs division; this shift in concept is\nreflected in Facebook\u2019s rebranding into Meta. Meta\nhas been investing heavily in the Reality Labs division,\nspending about $2.5 billion in Q2 and Q3 and $3.3\nbillion in Q4 to develop the Quest VR headset, VR\nsoftware and AR glasses, all of which reduce the\nmargins and ultimately leads to lower EPS growth.\nMoreover, recently, issues with the Metaverse have\nsurfaced, such as privacy concerns and users reporting\nharassment in the Metaverse, which puts the ethics\nand practicability of the Metaverse under scrutiny.\nSince the release of Metaverse is 10 to 15 years away,\nMeta will not be able to profit in the short run.\nOverall, Meta is facing a dwindling number of\nDAU due to intense competition; privacy issues\nbrought on by Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency\npolicy and the invalidation of the \u2018Privacy Shield\u2019\nall gnawed on revenue and led to Meta missing Q1\nforecasts. Cashflows from the Metaverse can only start\nbenefiting Meta in the distant future. Together, these\nfactors contributed to Meta\u2019s record-breaking single-day loss.\nAnna is one of the Senior Analysts at the Investment Society\u2019s\nCapital Fund, QT Capital whilst studying MSc Finance\nand Accounting at Imperial College Business School.\nMeta\u2019s problems are only getting bigger, and last week\u2019s share price tumble is fuelling the pressure.\nCredits: Dima Solomin // Unsplash\n\n"

Syrian and Afghani refugees enticed to Belarus with the prospect\nof easy visas and a free passage to Europe came in their droves to the eastern\nfrontier of the EU. Reports of Belarusian border guards cutting holes\nin the fence and encouraging refugees through were common, as were\nthose of violent pushbacks by Polish border guards. This has resulted in\nhundreds of refugees stranded in a no-man\u2019s land where they are exposed\nto sub-zero temperatures with next to no aid. At least 19 people have died.\nProtests against vaccine mandates reach new heights\nProtests against the mandate for Canadian truckers to be vaccinated\nagainst Covid-19 have now been ongoing for almost two weeks.

The coastguard vessel was attempting\nto intercept a boat containing suspected migrants when they say it\ntried to ram them. According to the coastguard, the crew \u201cfear[ed]\nfor their lives\u201d and opened fire on the ship, apparently trying to hit its\nengines. Upon boarding the vessel, they found the mother bleeding and\nbaby unresponsive. It is unclear how the use of deadly force on a boat\nsuspected of containing migrants would be justified in any situation.\nRefugees drown in attempt to escape Zimbabwe\nEconomic turmoil and a void of government support are leading to\nhundreds of Zimbabweans to attempt to leave their home country\nfor South Africa.

Wood\u2019s lyrics and\nvocals express distress \u2013 the lyrics are, taken literally,\nabout having a breakdown whilst following a cooking\ntutorial, and relying on a partner to calm you down\n\u2013 which is perfectly contrasted by the joyful backing\nvocals and warm accompaniment. It is a cathartic, if\nnot painful listen. I haven\u2019t had such visceral feelings\nlisteningtoasongsinceIfirstheardCarSeatHeadrest\u2019s\nTwin Fantasy. The way the lyrics broach mental health\nthrough storytelling that hints at a deeper underlying\nmeaning, and the words that phrase feelings you\ncouldn\u2019t express yourself, make the song (as well as the\nalbum as a whole) perhaps the most provocative one I\nhave heard in years.\nItisalmostimpossibletobelievethatthelyricsforthe\nalbum were written separately to the instrumentation.\nThe relationship between the two, in how each\nenhances the other, is breath-taking. The timbre and\ndynamics, and the articulation and song structure,\nconvey the emotion in Wood\u2019s lyrics with genius.\n\u2018Snow Globes\u2019 is different to anything the band have\never done before. The instrumentation is simple, the\nsong structure is simple, the rhythms are simple. This\nsimplicityiswonderfullycontrastedbyCharlieWayne\u2019s\ndrumming, which builds up from a slow rumble to an\nexpressive chaotic sound. The drums are so detached\nfrom the song that they almost occupy a completely\ndifferent soundscape, but somehow the track still feels\ncoherent and cohesive. The juxtaposition of the calm\ntrack with the chaotic drumming creates the idea of\nanguish below a calm exterior, which bubbles to the\nsurface as Wood\u2019s vocals become frantic and shouted as\nthe track explodes into enormity.\nThe final track on the album, \u2018Basketball Shoes\u2019, has\nbeen a highlight of a BC,NR set since before their\ndebut album was released. The 12-minute song is\nalmost operatic, with multiple sections that eventually\nreach the climax of the entire album. The band describe\n\u2018Basketball Shoes\u2019 as the track that AFUT was built\naround, with musical motifs from the song appearing\nin other tracks throughout the album. Originally about\na parasocial relationship with Charli XCX, \u2018Basketball\nShoes\u2019 has undergone many evolutions, with the current\nversion omitting all mention of her entirely. The song\ndescribes recovery from a codependent relationship,\nlearning to prioritise your own needs again (\u201cnow I\u2019m\nfeeling kinda normal with a packed lunch / train rides\ndon\u2019t hurt so much these days\u201d) and how difficult that\ncan be (\u201cif you see me looking strange with a fresh style\n/ I\u2019m still not feeling that great\u201d). The anthemic track\nexplodes into a triumphant finale with the band all\nsinging together as Wood shouts over it. It is the perfect\nclimactic ending for the album, and one Wood should\nbe proud to end his time as frontman of the band on.\nIt is a shame that AFUT will not get a live\nperformance. I did not appreciate the songs when they\nwerenewtomeintheirlivesets,andIwouldhaveloved\nto experience them live with the love for them I now\nhave,butIhavedeeprespectforanyartistthatprioritises\ntheir own needs\nand wish Wood\nall the best in his\nrecovery.Hehas\ntruly achieved\ns o m e t h i n g\nmagnificent in\nhis four years\nwith BC,NRand even if the\nBC,NR we knew are gone, the group are continuing as\na six-piece, and have proven with AFUT that they can\ntakeeachreinventionintheirstridetocreatesomething\nincredible, including the emotivity of mourning pass.\nAnd as a sensitive motherfucker, this album makes me\nwant to catapult myself into the sun. If you haven\u2019t\nheard it yet, go on, let blondie maim you, all too well.\n5 AP Dhillon Songs That Need To Be On Every Brown\nMunde\u2019s Playlist\nSince his debut in 2019, singer, lyricist, and music producer AP Dhillon has sung his way into\nthe hearts of millions of Punjabi music fans across the\nglobe. From his song \u2018Saada Pyaar,\u2019 which softly tugs\non listener\u2019s heartstrings, to his iconic Brown boy anthem \u2018Brown Munde,\u2019 each track has helped put Dhillon in a prime spot in the music game, with a large fan\nbase that only continues to grow. All of us might not\nunderstand Punjabi music but we can\u2019t party without\nit,andwecertainlycan\u2019tignoreit.Punjabisongsarethe\nlife of every party and even if you\u2019re not Punjabi, you\u2019d\nagree that grooving to\nPunjabi music is the best\n- and when we are talking about Punjabi music,\nAP Dhillon songs are on\neveryone\u2019s playlist these\ndays. From long drives to\na house party, we all listen to his music. So, here\nare five AP Dhillon songs\nthat need to be on every \u2018Brown Munde\u2019 playlist \u2013\n\u2018Excuses\u2019: There is a new heartbreak song in town,\nand we can\u2019t stop humming it. \u2018Excuses\u2019 by AP Dhillon\nand Gurinder Gill - with music by Intense - is all we are\nlistening to on Instagram. \u201cDil tera Jado tutuga tan pata\nlaguga,\u201d speaks to your soul and we know you think of\nthat one toxic ex every time this line comes on.\n\u2018Fate\u2019: \u2018Fate\u2019 talks about heartbreak and AP Dhillon\nand Gurrinder Gill have mastered the art of singing\nabout a broken heart. Shinda Kahlon, the featured\nartist on this cut, gives out a hard-hitting verse too. The\nproduction by Money Musik follows the trap formula,\nhard 808\u2019s and booming bass. This is the perfect\namalgamation of traditional and modern music styles\ncoming together.\n\u2018Takeover\u2019: \u2018Takeover\u2019 is a track that\u2019s bragging and\nboasting about the lavish lifestyle that these guys live.\nThe production features sinister bells that fit perfectly\nwith the lyrics of this cut. AP Dhillon and Gurrinder\nGill give each other space to shine individually which\nmakes their alliance even better. The featured artist,\nAR Paisley, packs a punch with his contribution to this\nsong.\n\u2018Chances\u2019: The most chill track on its EP, \u2018Chances\u2019\nflows smoothly throughout its runtime. The bass drops\nat the perfect time while the snares are just hypnotic on\nthat loopy flute in the background. In this production,\nAP Dhillon and Gurrinder Gill glide, taking turns at\nkilling their verses. They are two heartbroken boys\nwho\u2019ve found melody in their respective sorrows.\n\u2018Saada Pyaar\u2019: This song has AP Dhillon going\nsolo and the chemistry that he and Money Musik share\nis incredible. The song starts off with AP singing to a\nguitar strumming in the background which follows\nthe bass and the hi-hats. One of the deepest cuts on\nthis record, \u2018Saada Pyaar\u2019 is another heartbreaking tale\nabout unrequited love.\nLata Mangeshkar (1929-2022)\nThe Nightingale of India has fallen\nsilent. Lata Mangeshkar\u2019s extensive\noeuvre spanned 70 years \u2013 incomparable\nto any other Indian artist in the century.\nFelix Recommends\n\n"

    "content": "This week in Science...\nSticky situation! The search for magnetic monopoles\nPssssss... ploink! Dog urine and faeces could harm plant\nbiodiversity in nature reserves\nInflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) is the long-term inflammation of\nthe gut. Immunosuppressant drugs are often prescribed as treatment to\nreduce inflammation, but they can increase the risk of infections. Little\nis known about how patients with IBD treatment respond to vaccines.\nTwo particularly immunosuppressant drugs - infliximab and tofacitinib -significantly decrease the ability to induce protective antibody responses.\nThis was observed in 10% of patients on infliximab.\nNew experiments, envisaged by Imperial scientists, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN are bringing scientists closer to magnetic\nmonopoles, which have only a North or Southmagnetic pole. The LHC\nusually smashes single protons together at very high energies. In 2018 it\nsmashes heavy ions together, at lower energies. If the nuclei of two lead\nions pass very close to each other, it creates the strongest magnetic field in\ntheuniverse.Thismethodcouldproducemonopoles,butsofartheexper-iments have not crashed heavy ions together with enough energy. However, they have given scientists a food idea of the weight of monopoles, and\nthe kinds of higher energy that could be used in future to create them.\nA group of scientists at Ghent University in Belgium have found that\ndog waste could be harming the biodiversity of plants in suburban nature reserves. Urine and faeces contain large amounts of nitrogen and\nphosophorus, which act as fertilisers, encouraging the growth of certain\nplants, and resulting in habitat degradation. Prior to this study, little research had been conducted into the impact of dog waste on wildlife, with\nthe focus on disease transmission and disturbance of fauna. The researchers monitored the number of dogs at four nature reserves in Belgium and\nestimated the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus they brought in, using\nexisting data on nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in dog faeces\nand urine. The study assumed that dog owners don\u2019t take any of the waste\naway with them. \u201cDog owners should be aware that their dog is behaving\nas a fertiliser, and if this is not yet the case, pick up their faeces more\u201d, said\nProfessor Pieter De Frenne, speaking to New Scientist. The researchers\nfound that dog owners picking up all their dogs\u2019 faeces would reduce ni-trogenandphosphorusinput57%and97%respectively,comparedtothe\ncase where none of it was picked up.\nFROM IMPERIAL...\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nKa-chow! Two 2020 lightning flashes were longest on record\nThe World Meteorological Organisation has concluded that two lightning flashes which occurred in 2020 were the longest ever recorded. The\nfirst flash occurred in southern USA in April 2020, and spanned 768km\n\u2013 longer than the distance from London to Inverness, and 60km longer\nthan the previous record. The second flash occurred in South America,\nalong the Uruguayan-Argentinian border, lasting for 17 seconds, making it the longest single flash ever detected. Speaking to New Scientist,\nRandall Cerveny, Professor of Geographical Sciences at Arizona State\nUniversity, said, \u201cThis is important to scientists because it improves our\nunderstanding of the dynamics of lightning: how, where and, important-ly, why lightning occurs the way it does.\u201d\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n10\nSCIENCE\nARTICLES\nWANTED\nPhoto credits: Nicolas Geiseler Toran\nCOVID-19 vaccine may not be as effective in patients with\nIBD treatment\nPASSIONATE about something in science and want to get the word out?

The report\npublished by NASA comes one week\nafter US President Joe Biden and his\nadministration confirmed the extension\nof the space station\u2019s activities to 2030.\nA planned descent into the oceanic pole\nof inaccessibility, also known as \u201cPoint\nNemo\u201d, will lay the ISS at rest alongside\nmany old satellites and space debris that\nhave crashed there, most notably the\nformer Russian space station Mir, which\nhas been there since 2001.\nThe ISS has provided a unique\nplatform to conduct scientific research\nacross a wide range of disciplines \u2013\nincluding astronomy, materials science,\nmeteorology, human research, and space\nmedicine-withpower,data,cooling,and\ncrew available to support experiments.\nThe ISS has a unique microgravity\nenvironment that has allowed for\nexperimentstobeconductedthatsimply\nwould not have been possible in an\nEarth-based laboratory. Gravity at the\naltitude of the ISS (250 miles in space) is\napproximately90%asstrongasatEarth\u2019s\nsurface, but objects on the ISS are in a\ncontinuous state of free fall \u2013 resulting\nin an apparent state of weightlessness.\nA large array of some 3000\nmultidisciplinary experiments have\nutilised the space station\u2019s unique\nmicrogravity environment to date.\nIn 2018, an experiment instrument\nnamed the Cold Atom Laboratory\nwas initialised, which produced BoseEinstein Condensates (commonly\nreferred to as the \u201cfifth state of matter\u201d)\nforthefirsttimeinlow-earthorbit.Since\nthisdiscovery,theColdAtomLaboratory\nhas allowed us to study the behaviour of\natoms on a macroscopic scale, which has\nsupportedtheresearchanddevelopment\nof quantum technologies such as ultra-precise timekeeping, and sensing; thus\ntransforming the field of atomic physics.\nInadditiontothis,thereisNASA\u2019sTwins\nStudy, one of the most comprehensive\nand integrated studies conducted on\nthe ISS. It assessed the physiological,\nmolecular, and cognitive effects of long-term space flight on humans. Lasting 25\nmonths, astronaut Scott Kelly stayed\nin the ISS for 340 days, whilst his twin\nbrother Mark Kelly stayed on Earth.\nTen research teams collectively observed\nand compared the molecular profiles of\nthe twins. The results are not only being\nused to make future space missions safer\nfor astronauts but have developed our\nunderstanding of diseases induced by\nenvironmental stressors on Earth.\nPerhapsmyfavouriteaccomplishment\nof the ISS concerns the space station\u2019s\nservicing missions of the Hubble Space\nTelescope. Shortly after the telescope\nwas deployed in 1990, it was discovered\nthat the primary mirror of the telescope\nhad an aberration that affected the\nclarity and focus of the images it\nproduced. Fortunately, Hubble was\ndesigned in such a way that allowed\nastronauts to perform repairs, replace\nparts and update its technology with\nnew instruments. Astronauts on the\nISS first visited Hubble in December\n1993 \u2013 a further four service missions\nhave prolonged Hubble\u2019s life further\nand returned new insights including:\nthe discovery of two Plutonian moons,\nNix and Hydra; galaxy rotation curves;\na development to our understanding\nof dark energy. The speed and efficacy\nof these missions could not have been\nachieved without the ISS.\nLike all good things, the ISS cannot\nlast forever. We still have nearly a\ndecade for the space station to return\nnew insights into the way we view and\ninteract with our universe. During this\ntime, I will still be watching the ISS\nunblinkingly traverse our night sky with\nawe.\nLooking ahead to 2031, NASA aims\nto \u201cbroaden the audience reached by\nthe ISS to create more awareness of the\nbenefits of microgravity research and\ndevelopment and orbital activities to\nhumanity\u201d, whilst \u201ccontinuing to engage\nthe public through different platforms\nto communicate the values that the ISS\nbrings to the Nation and to the world\u201d.\nIn the meantime, NASA will continue\nto collaborate with national and\ncommercial partners from the European\nSpace Agency, Canada, Japan, and the\nRussian Federation to maintain the\ngeneral systems and functioning of the\nISS.\nFRIDAY 11TH FEBRUARY 2022\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nISS set to be retired in 2031, NASA\nreport confirms\nTaylor Pomfret Science Writer\nCredits: NASA, public domain\nThe International Space Station taken from Space Shuttle Discovery leaving the Space Station in March 2009\n\n"

    "content": "The first domesticated plants,\nprobably cereals, were cultivated\nin the Fertile Crescent around 10,000\nyears ago. The Fertile Crescent is an area\nlocated in the Middle East, particularly\nfavourable to the development of\nagriculture thanks to its sunny climate\nand the rivers that pass across it. Just\nlike the discovery of fire, the apparition\nof agriculture was a milestone in\nhuman history because it led to the\nestablishment of permanent residential\nzones. Having a stable residence also\nallowed people to possess more goods.\nAs in the forager lifestyle, only the most\nessentialitemscouldbecarried-tospeed\nup the pace. That is to say, the transition\nfrom nomadism to sedentarism caused\nthe emergence of private property. This\nwas key for the definitive establishment\nof hierarchical societies dominated\nby the wealth of material goods.\nThe domestication of plants was not\nlimited to the Fertile Crescent. Around\nthe same time, some civilisations were\ndiscovering the plants that could be\ncultivated, while others were already\ndeveloping canal systems to control the\nwater distribution to crops. Although\nthe oldest evidence of agriculture comes\nfrom the Fertile Crescent, the first\nsteps of the domestication of crops are\nmore likely to have happened in harsh\nenvironments. At the beginning of\nthe 20th century, the Russian botanist\nVavilov proved that domesticated plants\ncome from mountains and not valleys,\nas was previously thought. Mountainous\nregions are usually associated with\nharsh environmental conditions that\nincrease the rate of natural selection.\nMountain plants have more genetic\nvariability, which means there are more\ntrait differences among the individuals\nof the same population, which boosts\nthe biological fitness of the population.\nThe increasing genetic variability allows\nhumans to find plants with the \u2018ideal set\nof desirable traits\u2019 for cultivating. For\nexample, potatoes are originally from\nthe Andes, South America, and were\nbrought to Europe by Spanish sailors.\nPotatoes shaped human history by\ncontributing to the creation of the most\npowerful nation currently, the United\nStates of America. It all started in 1845,\ninIreland,whereamysteriousdiseasewas\nannihilating potatoes. These were a vital\nsource of food for the Irish population,\nespecially amongst the poorest people.\nThe destruction of potato crops caused\nthe deaths of around 1,000,000 Irish,\nand the migration of another 1,500,000\nto America. The arrival of such a huge\nnumber of immigrants boosted the\neconomy and demography of the US.\nNowadays, we know that the culprit of\nthe potato famine was a plant pathogen\ncalled Phytophtora infestants, which\ncontinuestobeamenaceforcropsecurity.\nHowever, the most important group\nof plants is undoubtedly the grasses.\nThe golden trio of cereals (wheat, corn,\nand rice) provides most of the calories\ningested by humans. Wheat alone\naccounts for around 20% of the total\ncarbohydrates and proteins of the global\npopulation. Sugarcane produces 80% of\nthe global sugar that you put in your tea.\nThe challenges of cereal cultivation\nalso created great innovation and\ndevelopment to society. It is therefore\nunderstandable why early civilisations\nplaced such a great value on these crops.\nFor example, folkloric dances and rituals\nwere carried out in Central Europe to\nattract or to celebrate the good harvest.\nIn the case of rice, its influence in Asia\nwas huge, as it has been a staple food\nfor millennia. It is a crop that requires a\ngreatdealofcareandwork.Infact,inthe\npast, farmers needed to plant rice one by\none with their bare hands. Furthermore,\nrice fields are sensitive to water levels;\nnot enough will dry the plants, but\ntoo much will cause them to rot. In\nresponse, people developed a system of\ncanalisation that can control the water\nlevels of the rice fields, which required\nworking in teams of hundreds or even\nthousands of people. The cultivation\nof crops required a great deal of\norganisation and involved many people,\nwhich is evident today in a world where\nthe process is industrialised and global.\nWith these few examples, it is clear\nthat\u201chumanhistoryistintedwithgreen\u201d.\nHowever, the domestication of plants\nwas only the beginning. Now, we are\nmodifying them genetically to enhance\ntheir properties in order to make them\nmore nutritious and robust.

    "content": "Bone metastasis is a complication of\ncancer which causes weak bones\nand fractures. A team of researchers\nfrom Imperial College London, University College London, and the University\nof Leeds are developing imaging techniques to ascertain the point at which\nbones in the spine will fracture. To prevent such fractures, they are exploring\nthe use of implants made from metama-terials to support the weakened bone.\nCancer cells can move throughout\nthe body via the bloodstream. This often results in further complications\naway from the primary site of cancer.\nWhen these cancer cells spread to a\ndifferent part of the body, the cancer is\nsaid to have metastasised. Breast cancer is commonly known to metastasise,\nwith 20-30% of patients suffering from\nthis condition. Bone metastasis occurs\nwhen cancer spreads from the originally afflicted site to the bone, forming a\nsecondary tumour. Consequently, the\npatient\u2019s bones are weakened and are\nat risk of breaking. Fractures can eventually be induced by physical trauma,\nor fractures can naturally occur as patients go about their routine activities.\nThe team\u2019s research focuses on bone\nmetastasis in the spine. The spine com-prises33stackedvertebrae.Theresearch-ers will be using advanced computational modelling to calculate the strength of\nvertebrae at various targeted locations.\nThese predicted values are compared\nto the actual forces on the spine, to determine the likelihood of fracture. \u201cThe\nproblemdoctorsfaceisthattheyhaveno\nway of knowing which of the spinal vertebrae is going to collapse. If, or when,\nthat happens, patients may require major surgery which involves a lengthy\nperiod of rehabilitation,\u201d said Professor\nRichard Hall, the lead researcher and\nProfessor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Leeds. This\nknowledge gap highlights the urgent\nneed for methods to accurately identify the vertebrae at risk of fracturing.\nAnother objective of the investigation\nis to design implants made from meta-materials to prevent the patients\u2019 bones\nfrom fracturing. A metamaterial is a\nmaterial that has been modified to have\nproperties that are not naturally found\nin the material. For example, the meta-materialcouldhardenwhensubjectedto\nstress. This property would enhance the\nimplant\u2019s capacity to strengthen weak\nbones. The researchers are investigating\nthe medical applications\nof structural metamateri-als which are commonly\nused in the aerospace in-dustry. A historical example of this is in the titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V.\nTi-6Al-4V was discovered\nto be suitable to make im-plants, as its elastic modulus is comparable to that\nof cortical bones \u2013 the\ntype of bone that makes\nup 80% of the skeleton. In\ntheaerospaceindustry,Ti-6AL-4V is used in compressor blades and casings\nbecause of its resistance\nto fatigue. Alongside the\ninvestigations into structural metamaterials, the\nAdvanced Manufacturing Group at Imperial\u2019s\nDyson School of Design\nEngineering is designing a 3D printer that can\naccurately print unique\nimplants for each patient.\nRecovery from spinal\nfracture typically takes\nweeks or months, because invasive surgery is\nrequired. However, the\nresearchers aim to reduce\nthe recuperation period\nwhen an implant is inserted to support the weakened bone. A key-hole\nsurgery will need to be\ncarried out to introduce\nthe implant at the identified site. This procedure is minimally\ninvasive as only small cuts of about half\nan inch will have to be made, instead of\na larger incision. Such an approach is ad-vantageous, as the patients are predicted\nto recover from the surgery within days.\nBone fracture due to metastasis can\nhave devastating impacts on cancer pa-tients. A fracture in the spine can cause\nspinal cord injury which may then result in paralysis. Patients often experience pain that becomes exacerbated\nwith bed rest. The grim reality is that\ncancer becomes increasingly difficult\nto cure once it has metastasised. Hopefully, more cancer patients will at least\nbe able to live more comfortable lives,\nwith reduced risk of bone fracture,\nwhen this innovative technology is accepted and rolled out on a large scale.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nRachel Rajan George Science Writer\nCancer cells can travel through the blood stream to form secondary tumors elsewhere in the body\nResearchers aim to use spinal implants to protect agaisnt cancer induced spinal fractures\nApplications of medical engineering to\ndiagnose and treat metastatic cancers\nPhoto credits: National Cancer Institute (USA), Jane Hurd\n\n"

    "content": "The Emotional Context\nIf I am being honest with myself,\nI became anti-relationship after a series\nof failed relationships and situationships\n- as do most people after having gone\nthrough a breakup. In the spirit of a\ntrue Imperial student, I turned to books\nabout relationships (I should note mainly books written by feminists), wanting\nthem to convince me further that relationships would not benefit me, and\neven go as far as to hinder me. It worked.\nSo now I am not only anti-relationship\ndue to heartbreak, but I also have real\nammunition behind my personal belief\nwhich I have attempted to articulate in\nthis article.\nThe Nuclear Family and\nHaving a Career\nAfter reading \u2018Why I\u2019m not a Feminist\u2019 by Jessa Crispin, I felt so enraged\nthat women were almost condemned to\nthis life of being born, educated, told to\ngetajob,thenexpectedtogiveallthatup\nto dedicate their lives to raising a family.\nJust because we have ovaries. I refused to\nbelieve that this would be the series of\nevents that describe my life because, as a\nwoman, I am \u2018innately more maternal\u2019. I\nwould like to quickly mention that I do\nnot see the issue with wanting that life\nfor yourself as a wom-an. It goes without\nsaying that being a\nmother is commend-able. But what I did\nnot like was the fact\nthat this was a \u2018given\u2019\nin society. It is the expectation of whatever\nman that I may one\nday meet that he will\nnot give up his career\nto raise my children.\nBecause why would\nhe? He is told that it\nis in his biology to be\nthe strong, responsible provider in our\nnuclear family.\nI like the idea of\nthe house-husband.\nWomen can be the\nproviders, particularly as technology\nhas developed i.e.,\nthe contraceptive pill\nallowing women to\npostpone having children in order to pri-oritise their careers.\nBut should the liberation of the working\nwoman be at the expense of her husband\nwho has worked equally hard to get his\ndream career? Not if he doesn\u2019t want\nto. I cannot understand why anyone, regardless of gender, would willingly sacrifice all they had worked for to have a\nfamily. Why must anyone compromise?\nThe formation of nuclear families, based\non the argument of human biology, has\nhistorically benefitted men, but even\nwith these developments it is still oppressive to the parent who must undergo\nthe sacrifice.\nThe next argument is that you can\nhave both. This is the solution concocted to prevent the dissolution of\nthe nuclear family which is the basis for\nthe whole of society. Too much change\nwould be scary so we need to tell the\ngirls something that\nwill stop them from\nthinking too hard\nabout it. That\u2019s it. We\nwill tell them they\ncan be a CEO and\nthen go home to their\nmansions to their\ngorgeous, rich husband and kiss their\nstraight A* children\ngoodnight. Maybe\nthis is possible. With\nmoney and with help\ni.e., a nanny for your\nbaby or a private tutor to help your child\nwith their home-work. Can the average working woman\nafford this level of\nextra care needed\nfor her to have both?\nIn 2021 the average\nsalary for a woman\nwas \u00a328,305 in the\nUK, according to the\nOffice for National\nStatistics. So, let us\nsay that the average\nsuccessful woman is on a salary of about\n20% more than that, so \u00a333,600. Full\ntime nursery care in the UK averages at\nabout \u00a314,000 which is 41.7% of her sal-ary. This is not taking into account the\nquality of the care. Would this be providing the best quality of life for your\nchild? Even if it was, what about emotional care? Is it ethical to have someone\nelse raise your child?\nFinally, what about having children in\nlater life? Maybe you are lucky enough\nto see an early retirement on the hori-zon. Or you have an established career,\nand you feel like now is the time to step\nback. My argument here is that delaying reproduction is detrimental to the\noffspring. The best-known example to\nsupport this argument is the prevalence\nof Down\u2019s Syndrome. At 25, the rate of\nan embryo having Down syndrome at\nweek 10 of pregnancy is 0.09%. At 35,\nthis rises to 0.42% and by 45, the Down\nsyndrome rate increases to 5.3%. It begs\nthe question: commitment to success or\ncommitment to survival? It is my belief\nthat you cannot have both and do both\nwell.\nChildren and the\nEnvironment\nIt is almost trendy now to care about\nthe environment. Buying from charity\nshops is \u2018cool\u2019 and God forbid you buy\nfrom Pretty Little Thing. Look how fast\nMolly Mae gets attacked after benefitting from the capitalist structure which\nis slowly murdering the planet.

    "content": "Behold, the day has come. We\u2019ve been blessed with\nsome stellar new music from Hippo Campus,\nBlack Country, New Road, Mitski, and more today.\nLet\u2019s get down to business and talk about the new\nHippo Campus album, LP3.\nI\u2019m sorry but we have to start on a sad note. The\npandemic rages on and another tour is taken from the\nears of today. Hippo Campus have delayed their UK\ntour until May this year so my pleas were obviously\nnot heard; now they\u2019ll be gracing The Garage on May\n9th. Worryingly, this is the night before my Quantum\nPhysics exam so if you are my quantum lecturer and\nyou\u2019re reading this \u2013 of course I won\u2019t go see one of\nmy favourite bands who only come to the UK once\nevery few years the night\nbefore your exam. This\nwas going to be a joint\nalbum and gig review, but\nthe band must\u2019ve read the\ntwo single reviews of their\ntracks and wanted more of\nmy words, so it\u2019ll just be\nthe album review for now.\nWait patiently for the gig\nin May, people.\nLP3 is the culmination\nof nine years of Hippo\nCampus: it is the journey\nto where they are today,\nand the fans that they\u2019ve\nbroughtalongwiththem.I\nfirst listened to the band in 2017 when their breakout\nhit \u2018South\u2019 was recommended to me on the YouTube\nsidebar. I was drawn in by lead singer Jake Luppen\u2019s\nversatile vocals, guitarist Nathan Stocker\u2019s twinkling\nriffs, bassist Zach Sutton\u2019s driving basslines, and\ndrummer Whistler Allen\u2019s hypnotic drums. These\naspects that made me love the band are still here in\nLP3 but joined by qualities gained in other works,\nlike the synthesised sounds of second album Bambi\nandthedeep-diveelectronicsoundscapesofrecentEP\nGood Dog, Bad Dream. This is the basis of the album:\ngrowth and maturation while staying true to yourself.\nKicking off with a public safety announcement\nagainst faux-adolescent confidence, opening track \u20182\nYoung 2 Die\u2019 builds from a lone horn from trumpet\nplayer DeCarlo Jackson up into one of my favourite\nchoruses of the album featuring ethereal vocals, uber-compressed drums and synths that rival tracks from\nBambi. Jackson and Stocker shine on this album.\nTrumpet and guitar riffs no longer give each other\nspace as was the case on previous records, now they\ninterplay beautifully; twirling and lacing in and out\nof sync with the perfection of prima ballerinas, most\nimpressively heard in \u2018Scorpio\u2019.\nI\u2019dliketostopandtaketimetogiveaspecialmention\nto one of my top tracks of the album, \u2018Bang Bang\u2019. It\nuses stop time accents and polyrhythmic vocals, two\nof my top 5 musical techniques that I\u2019m a complete\nsucker for. I\u2019m excited to see the band live in May to\nsee who sings the other of the two interlocking vocal\nlinesinthelastchoruswithLuppenafterIsurprisingly\nlearnt Allen and Stocker sing when I saw the band in\nNewcastle back in 2019. On the stops, they work\nflawlessly to enhance the\ndrop into the chorus. For the\nentire album, the band have\nmasterfully utilised volume\nchanges to transform\nincredibly sparse sections\ninto massive stadium filling\nsoundscapes.\nClosing the album is my\nfavouritetrack,\u2018Understand\u2019.\nReminiscent of \u2018Buttercup\u2019\nwhich ended first album\nLandmark, \u2018Understand\u2019\nmelds old and new sounds,\ncompleting the journey that\nthe album embarked on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what we are,\nit just has to work / Where we end is something far\n/ Something hard to understand\u201d says Luppen in\nthe chorus, reaching an acceptance of powerlessness\nagainst the future but promising to live happily in\nthe moment. The best sound on the record is what\nseems like something falling off the drum kit at the\nstart of the guitar solo, it could be skilful drumming\nfrom Allen or a lucky sample of a tumble in the studio.\nWhatever it is, it\u2019s so satisfying to listen to \u2013 trust the\nprocess. Listening to that sound so much also lets\nme listen to Stocker\u2019s guitar solo, a soft, shimmering\nmasterpiece. This is Hippo Campus at their best.\n23\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Tara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nDon\u2019t miss the gig - One\nNight at the Pembroke\n@ 19:00 17th Feb\nHeadlined by Quadronaut,\nBakburner, and Monkeys in Living\nForm Society,\nLive Music\nSociety is taking\ntheir show\noutside the\nhallowed halls\nof the Union.\nCatch them at\nthe Pembroke for a night of live\nmusic and (discounted) drinks.\nLucy Dacus is back just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day\nwith \u2018Kissing Lessons\u2019.

We do not consider how our relationships may be impacting the environment when we shame someone for not\nrecycling.\nThe Biology of Monogamy\nJessa Crispin had convinced me that\nI do not want to sacrifice a career for a\nfamily. The next logical step for me was\nto challenge my perception of romantic relationships. So, I read \u2018Untrue\u2019 by\nWednesday Martin for an insight into\nthe alternatives to monogamy.\nAll of my family are monogamous. I\nhad grown up thinking this is what happens because it works in the best way.\nHowever, Martin hinted to me that this\nmight not be the case.\nGenerally, it is accepted that women\nare the more monogamous gender. Men\ncan \u2018spread their seed\u2019 and impregnate\nmultiple women at one time whereas\nwomen can only fall pregnant by one\nman at a time. By natural selection, we\nwant the best offspring and so women\nshould be more judicious in their choice\nof men to better their chances here. Stephen Fry even went as far as to claim\nthat women do not even enjoy sex. He\nbelieves they see it as \u2018the price to pay for\na relationship\u2019.\n\u2018Untrue\u2019 unveils the truth that this\nassumption is a lie. Between 2018 and\n2019, women were found to cheat 40%\nmore in monogamous relationships\nthan in previous years. A study by Meana concluded that familiarity of spouse\ndecreases the female libido as opposed\nto males who were likely to report sexual satisfaction from sex with a long-term\npartner.\nI encourage you to pick up the book\nfor more extensive statistics, but I had\nconcluded that women are not necessarily the monogamous beings that I had\ngrown up thinking. Women cheat just as\nmuch as men. Women like sex as much\nas men. But why are we so committed to\nthe idea of a happy ending in a monogamous relationship, if we are going to be\ndisloyal? As a 20-year-old, it is impossible for me to imagine how it feels to be\ntethered to one other human being for\n60 years. I have known my parents for\n20 years and that is my longest standing relationship to a human. One can\nimagine that after 60 years, you may get\nbored or look outside of your romantic\nrelationship for stimulation, may that be\nintellectual or sexual. This is where poly-amory offers a solution. We have infinite\nlove for multiple friends, parents have\ninfinite love for multiple children. Why\ndo we limit ourselves to just one romantic partner? Polyamory offers a logical\nsolution, yet it is not quite accepted as\n\u2018normal\u2019 by society.\nLove is Not the Problem\nI am not anti-love. Love is amazing\nand I love many people in my life. The\nproblem is the weighting that romantic\nlove has in the decision-making process\nthat young women undertake when\ncrafting the paths that will be their fu-ture.\nYou just have to open TikTok or Instagram to see pictures of happy couples\nwith millions of likes. Society values\nmonogamy, not love. It seems that if you\nare in a relationship, then you must be\ndesirable and therefore you are higher\nup the food chain. We envy people in\nhappy relationships, but we do not envy\nourselves despite having other forms of\nlove in our lives.\nOntheothersideofthecoin,thereare\nthe female influencers living their \u2018hotgirl summer\u2019. We love to see empowered,\nsingle women and we celebrate them as\nfeminists. But do we seek personal improvement in order to make ourselves\nmore attractive on the romantic market?\nIt is a pessimistic view, but a valid one.\nI worry that we place so much emphasis on the importance of romantic\nrelationships that we lose sight of things\nthat matter more.\nThis is my opinion, but I hope it made\nyou uncomfortable. I hope somewhere,\nyou felt angry that you slightly agreed\nwith me. We are convinced from a young\nage that this is what we need to do. Enter\na monogamous relationship and have a\nfamily. Do not think about it too much\nbecause you will be unhappy. Well, I am\nthinking, and I am unhappy. Thinking\nabout it and challenging the expected\nallows me to make decisions now, while\nI am in my 20s, that I hope will result in\nme living a happier and more fulfilled\nlife. If you disagree, please convince me I\nam wrong. Because that would definitely\nbe an easier fate to accept. It is the default after all.\nPRIVATE SCHOOLS & STATE\nEDUCATION SURVEY\nComment is working on an article on private schooling in the\nUK and the future of the state education system, so we are looking for students to complete a brief survey on their education\nexperiences, and thoughts on private vs state schooling.

    "content": "Adam McKay\u2019s 2022 opening\nblockbuster Don\u2019t Look Up casts a\nstar-studded Leonardo DiCaprio (Dr.\nRandall Mindy), Jennifer Lawrence\n(PhD candidate Kate Dibiasky), and\nMeryl Streep (President Jane Orlean)\namong others in a disaster satire. The\nfilm is directed at the juxtaposition of\na civilization that can\u2019t decide on the\nmost fundamental quant of existence\u2014\nthe truth. The title accurately forebodes a society that is split on whether\nthey want to look up at their impending doom or to not; instead, denying\nthe existence of an inconvenient fact.\nThe knowledge of a meteor headed\nfor a direct collision with earth hits the\nsearching astrophysicists (Mindy and\nDibiasky) as hard as the 20km wide\nmeteor would eventually hit the Earth.\nAwareoftheconsequenceofsuchacollision, the two scientists sound (off) every\nalarm that they are aware of\u2014only to be\nfaced by a mocking and distracted group\nof politicians, media presenters, and\npublicat-large.Unsureonpathsforward,\nthe meme of conspiratorial scientists is\nupgraded to a dynamic duo as political\ntides turn. Unsure on the motivation,\nthe two proceed with government plans\nto fly missiles into the now eponymous\ncomet: Dibiasky\u2019s comet; allowing the\nmeteor to be stopped and bring national dogma for a perfect hero story.\nThe moment of success is diverted as\ntech mogul Peter Isherwell (played by\nMark Rylance) senses an opportunity\nfor a market solution to a naturalistic\nscenario. Isherwell suggests a solution\nto vicariously absorb the impact of\nthe meteor by extracting minerals and\nresources to bring a new era to Earth.\nThe science, however, does not add up.\nIsherwell and his band of racketeers\ndon\u2019t need science, they only need\nPresident Orlean to issue the order.\nThe extraction scenario becomes the\nonly scenario. Eventually, placated and\nconfounded, Mindy and Dibiasky are\nleft to plea with the citizens of Earth\nto look up and consider the severity\nand disarray in which humanity stands.\nAlas, their cries fall on deaf ears, their\neyes stare into faces that don\u2019t care, and\ntheir words are left unread. The movie\nbuilds up to its final minutes as the\nclimax shows a meteor within meters\nof collision. For a moment, the world\nhopes that Isherwell\u2019s pseudoscientific\nplot would come to be the victor; this\nof course was not the case. Eventually,\nthe meteor causes utter destruction\nand decimation of all humanity\u2014akin\nto the meteors that allegedly killed\nthe dinosaurs. The movie finishes with\nmetaphors, allegories, and microcosms\ngalore\u2014a buildup of soft signaling that\nthis movie wasn\u2019t just about a comet.\nIn the moment of death and complete\ndestruction, the lens of the camera\nshows that the world does recover\nand come back to a form that we are\nfamiliar with. Just that it does not have\nany humans to lay their eyes upon it.\nA viewer in social and scientific\nisolation may immediately shrug\nthis movie of as some jejune work of\napocalyptic fantasy by McKay. That\nviewer might not be wrong. The movie\ndwellsonasubjectthathasbeenexplored\ntimeandagainbyfilmswhichhyperbolize\nhuman interaction\u2014bringing out the\nflight and fight to its epitome. It\u2019s worth\nnoting that the movie does have some\nlogical inconsistencies\u2014where were the\nintelligenceorganizationsinallofthis?A\nfair question when the movie is analysed\nin isolation. However, the viewer of the\n21st century, alive in the consequence\nand pressure of humanity, would\nimmediatelyseetheunmissableparallels.\nDon\u2019t Look Up surrounds a meteor\nof dire consequences with the rationale\nof science, the confluence of economic\nand social stances, and raw emotion.\nSound familiar? McKay and the writers\nhave carefully built the context of this\nfilm by mirroring one that exists today.\nAll it takes to make a levelized context\nis to replace Mindy and Dibiasky with\n97% of the scientific community;\nreplace meteor deniers with science/\nestablishment deniers; replace\nIsherwell with the Tech moguls we\nare so familiar with; replace President\nOrlean with, well you know who.\nThe majesty of Don\u2019t Look Up is that\nit is an architype of a world which is\nstuck; unsure on how to address climate\nchange and unsure on how to reduce the\nliability of those who deny it and negate\nits externalities on the most vulnerable.\nIt speaks about the problem that is faced\nwhen devious market solutions are used\nto build an ersatz appearance of climate-progressiveness. It speaks of how as a\nworld, the lack of an aegis, a common\nbase is quite literally catastrophic.\nPerhaps climate change is not a meteor\nstrike that\u2019s going to cause destruction\nephemerally, but it certainly is a meteor\nstrike.So,usethismovietocommunicate\nwith politicians, corporations, and\npeople to collectively take a step\nback and look up; there\u2019s a meteor\nheaded this way and we\u2019re not ready.\nA meteor is coming this\nway- Don\u2019t Look Up! spoilers ahead\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFRIDAY 11TH FEBRUARY 2022\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMonika Yordanova\nMarie Mori\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment View online here!\nPranjul Mathur Environment Writer\n13\nCredit: Wikimedia commons\n\n"
