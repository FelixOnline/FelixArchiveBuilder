Instead, Hyde\nPark became the venue, but this did not\ndetract from the standard of play. Our\ncoach, Pete Joyce, was not fazed by the\nchange and quickly got to work in getting things together and going through\nsome simple drills. Trial games then\nbegan, with an .array of skills being\nshown by both fresher s and some of the\nmore senior players. The attitude of all\nconcerned was commendable, and\nsome of the older lads who did not turn\nout could maybe learn a thing or two\nfrom today.

    "content": "12 October 1998 Film 21\nRound-up\nLethal\nWeapon 4\nCall me pathetic or lad dish if you like, but as far as I'm concerned, LW4 was simply\nthe most enjoyable film of the summer. All the old cast - Gibson, Glover, Pesci and\nRusso - return, plus new boy Chris Rock (think eighties Eddie Murphy) and an estimated $140 million budget. With twelve years and three movies already under their\nbelt, producer-director partnership Joel Silver and Richard Donncr recognise the\nimportance of the right mix between action, comedy and those classic clich es. However, this time around there Is a far stronger sense of irony thrown into the mix,\nwith the script happily sending itself up, and at the same time pushing the action\nto ever greater extremes. Hardly a classic, but perfect cinema nonetheless.\nThere's Something About Mary is drop dead funny. No'more need be said. Think\nwhat you may of their sense of humour, but the farrelly brothers arc the finest purveyors of all out comedy currently in Hollywood. Whilst Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin were filled with toilet gags, Mary is far more reliant on visual jokes, which had\nthe entire audience in hysterics from start to finish when I saw the film. Whilst you\nmay well have already seen some of the more infamous scenes in trailers, many\nof the funniest moments come from the (comparatively) subtle gags - witness Matt\nDillon's dire attempts at lying about his experience with retarded children, and fee\nEvan'sap paling American accent. Very American, but very funny.\nThere's Something\nAbout Mary\nSaving\nPrivate Ryan\nSaving Private Ryan has received massive Critical acclaim for its painfully vivid portrayal of the realities of life in World War Two, and its hard lo fault as an amazing\npiece of film-making, for which Steven Spielberg could deservedly pick-up another\nOscar. However, so perfectly does it portray the troops as a group of ordinary guys,\nthat It becomes hard to connect with any of them. This has little to do with the performances - which are first rate - and more to do with a script which steadfastly\nrefuses to focus on the Gl's own stories. Instead, every inch of celluloid is devoted\nto persuading you of the horrors of war, and as a result you are left feeling unsatisfied, hardly caring whether the principal characters live or die.\nThe big British hit of the Summer, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels has gained\nnotoriety largely for its eclectic casting, which includes footballer Vinnie Jones, Sting,\nand former Press-Gang star Dexter Fletcher. However, it's the intricate plotting and\ntiming that are the real stars of the film, and despite sub-Neighbours acting, with\nVinnie Jones looking like a fully fledged character actor by comparison, the script\nis genuine edge-of-your-the material, tying both audience and characters up in knots.\nAlthough so far removed from reality it's borders on fantasy - Fast End gangsters\nonly behaved like this in forties movies, - it remains fresh and original enough to\nremind you of everything thats good about the British Film industry.\nLock, Stock &\nTwo Smoking\nBarrels\nX Files :\nFight the\nFuture\nThink double-episode of a recent series, add slightly more will-they, won't they tension and a$60 million price tag and you've got this one sorted. With over a hundred episodes already under their belts, it's a formula that can't really fail. The only\nproblem the makers seemed to face was how to keep everyone happy - give the\ncharacter introduction new viewers require without boring the hard-core fans. What\nresults is a convoluted opening, in which Mulder and Scully give a crash course in\nfive series worth of back story in the space of five minutes. After that, however,\nthings start to settle down, and all the standard elements drop into place. It simply\ncomes down to this : if you like the series, you'll like the film. End of story.\nFilm making for the Beavis & Butthead generation has never before come in such\na perfectly condensed form. Stuff blows up....really corny dialogue....idiotic chases\naround....cheesy one-liners....And so it continues, with very little plot to speak of and\ndialogue with absolutely no pretensions of literary merit. Instead, producer Jerry Bruckheimer - Hollywood's king of the big budget blockbuster - mixes up stereotyped\ncharacters, huge effects, a touch of romance (Llv Tyler and Ben Affleck) and a big\nstar name (Bruce Willis). Whilst it's hardly Casablanca, or even Die Hard, it's a case\nstudy of the modern Hollywood studio system. Corny, idiotic and implausible as it\nmay be, but it's entertaining enough to brighten-up any rainy afternoon.\nArmageddon\nGodzilla\nShite. Really. The worst film I 've seen in quite a while (and I saw Cannibal Amazon\nWomen in the A vaca do Jungle of Death last week). Do not, under any circumstances\nor by any provocation - even offers of sex from the man/woman of your dreams -see this film. Bad effects (grey skies and continual rain attempt to hide the obvious edges to the CGI), damn poor acting, scenes clearly hijacked from Aliens and\nJurrassic Park, and some hilarious product placements combine to produce what\ncan only be described as a shockingly awful waste of celluloid. With every penny\nof the $70 million plus budget wasted, this is by far this Summer's worst offering.\nLet me make this clear - DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.\n\n"

    "content": "12 October 1998 Columns 11\nRight Angles to Reality Matt Salter\nEskimos have over 200 different words\nfor snow. Or at least that is what I was\ntold by a good friend of mine who was\ntrying to learn Eskimo (according to him,\nalthough it appears at first glance to be\na fearsome ly difficult language to learn,\nit is really quite straightforward once you\nget inuit). I suppose this makes sense.\nBeing surrounded by the stuff for 12\nmonths of the year, it's only reasonable\nto expect that they'd be the world leaders in classifying the stuff into different\nsub-groups - to break up the monotony\nof the frozen north if nothing else. It\nmust fill in those idle moments between\nrunning away from polar bears and cleaning up husk ie shit.\nMy friend's titbit of \"this-might-just-get-me-the-Science-and-Nature-cheese-when-l next-play-Trivial-Pursuit\" malarkey\nset me thinking - which is in Itself a perilous venture. The Eskimos go to nit-pick-ing, almost trains potter esque lengths in\ntheir attempts to establish minute differences between to what you and I simply regard as just another way of getting cold and wet, precisely because\nsnow is at the very centre of their lives,\nIt being quite literally everywhere (and\nlets face it, there are only so many times\nyou can write your own name before the\nnovelty wears off, or in some cases, falls\noff). Taken to a logical conclusion, one\nmight expect a similar plethora of adjectival nouns wherever there exists a large\nrange of similar but very slightly different\nvariations on a theme. And indeed, this\nis the case.\nThose of you who have lived in London as long as I have, and who have paid\nannually a sum far in excess of the\nNicaraguan defence budget to London\nRegional Transport (motto: \"Solving Yesterday's Problems Tomorrow\"), will have\nno doubt noticed the \"Eskimo Snow Phenomenon\" insofar as it relates to the\n\"service\" that they provide (LRT not the\nEskimos). In order to see what I mean, try\nkeeping a record for, oh let's say a month, of all the different ways that the\nlads at LRT have of telling you, the paying customer, that you ain't getting home\nin time for t as tenders tonight. Go on, I challenge you. All your favourites are\nhere: from the classic \"due to earlier signalling problems (c.1952) at Edgware\nRoad/Earl's Court/Ravenscourt Park/King's Cross/Mars*,- delays are occurring to all\ndestinations on the Circle/District/Piccadilly/Northern Line\" (\"delete as app li c able); through \"due to a train being taken\nout of service (and being humanely put\ndown ?) the next train along will be so full\nthat when the doors open crushed bodies will spew out onto the platform causing even worse delays\"; right up to the\ntruly desperate \"because of earlier (insert\nimplausible excuse here) at (name of\njust about any LRT station on the map),\nyou may find that your journey takes a little <wince> longer than usual\" Whilst\nyou're compiling you list, bear in mind\nthat these are the jokers who brought\nyou \"you might find that you need to\nallow extra time for your journey\" (it's a bit f*!%@$g late for that now y 'bastard);\n\"mind the gap\" (once mis heard by a Japanese friend of mine, to his great\nconsternation) and my own personal\nfavourite: \"use all available doors\".\nBut no matter how hard they try, LRT\nwill always be playing second fiddle to\nthat cherished band of heroes who have\ndone more to advance the cause of the\n\"same but different\" lobby since Status\nQuo learned to play the 12-bar blues. I speak of course of none other than toi-i let paper manufacturers - or more specifically of the product which they supply.\nFrom the humblest to the highest, from\nthe 1st year mechanical engineer up to\nMrs Windsor herself, the prodi gen y of\nMessers Andrex and Dixell touches us all\n(or at least a certain part of us all). But for\na commodity which must surely represent the ultimate in \"use once then throw\naway\", it comes in a simply staggering\nrange of prices, hues and textures. You\nmay have stood, as did I on a recent\nshopping trip; pulse racing, senses\ninflamed, gazing enraptured in wide-eyed disbelief at the kaleidoscopic Pavilion of Paper, the Temple of Tissue, the\nCathedral of Consumerism that is the\nbog roll aisle. Why it is always adjacent\nto the frozen vegetable cabinets is\nbeyond me when sure iy it would make\nmore sense to put it next to the ready-to-eat curries. Inappropriate locations\nnotwithstanding, this does not distract\nfrom sheer number of different varieties\navailable, all promising us a bum-cleans-ing experience of un par all ed comfort\nand convenience, everyone an inter gral part of a meticulously planned Image. We\nall knew and feared the Andrex puppy (as\na child I lived in such fear of a Labrador\ndancing under the toilet door that I could\nbarely uncle nch my buttocks long\nenough to get the job done) but like it\nor not we remember what he came to\nsell to us. It's daft, it's incredible, it's the\nvisible tip of a multi-million pound ice-berg.\nThe names of the products are\nundoubtedly the bastard brainchildren of\nyoung, overpaid, ad-execs. Go and look\nif you don't believe me. \"Revive\" may\nsound like a brand of patent smelling\nsalts and Quilted Velvet like a film starring\nthe young Elizabeth Taylor, but the prize\nfor \"Mindlessly Stupid Name For A Personal I ly gie ne Product in 1998\" goes to\nDixell's \"Kittensoft\". I mean, what's that all\nabout? My first reaction was that this\nhad to be a ghastly misreading of the\npublic mood, the product of a diseased\nimagination. If it were merely an accident\nof the most humour less kind, it would be\nalmost understandable, but in an age\nwhere everything is researched, dissected and rudely probed for hints of hidden meaning it is inconceivable that this\nname was merely chosen at random.\nOh no. Quite obviously we are being\ninvited to believe that using this toilet\npaper faithfully recreates the sensation of\nwiping one's arse on a baby cat. As I have\nnever even contemplated performing\nthis most basic of hygiene activities using\na member of the feline genus, juvenile\nor otherwise, I cannot vouch for the\naccuracy of this claim. All I know is that\nI have not yet reached the \"Kittensoft\"\nstage in life.\nI have long maintained that one can\nchart one's progress up the ladder of life\nby the toilet roll that one uses. I have\npassed through the school issue \"grease-proof\" stage where one was forced to\nmake use of stuff that was little more\nthan tracing paper. Then I left home and\nprogressed onto the \"made from 100%\nrecycled\" loo paper, only to switch allegiances yet again when my priorities\nchanged from saving the planet to saving my ring piece. For ages I bought toilet paper, but in recent years I find that\nI 've graduated to toilet tissue - a trivial\ndistinction to some, but one to be held\nonto when it is the only tangible manifestation of personal advancement. I kid\nmyself that I'm on the way to wealth and\nsuccess by buying big fat rose-coloured\nrolls of Supersoft 3-ply and wiping my\nway into a better lifestyle. As yet, how-ever, I have not quite made it into the\n\"Kittensoft\" club, where people glide\nthrough life effortlessly and securely,\nmaking daring and witty conversation,\nspending their summers in the Maldives\nand their winters in Gstaad. I'm yet to join\nthe select few who have almost impossibly tanned and taut bodies and buttocks which they caress clean with\nsquares of raw silk.\nAnyway, I'd better be off. It's just\nstarted snowing and I'm dying for a crap.\n\n"

    "content": "ASH\nNu-Clear Sounds\nMusic 12 October 1998\nCongratulations. It's a girl!\nSummer's over, the reality of having to actually\nstart doing stuff with your life again is kicking in\nand you're getting fed up with your album\nacquisitions from the vacation. It's time for something\nfresh and new; a different perspective, perhaps. Well,\nNu-Clear Sounds might not be the perfect prescription\nbut it should tie you over before your next fix.\nAs you may or may not know the new blood in Ash's veins comes from one Charlotte Ila the rly, recruited as\nan extra guitarist and vocalist. Most of the song writ ng is still handled by the capable Tim Wheeler although\nIla the rly is credited on the opening track. Projects,\nwhich is a guitar layered slog with a slightly pessimistic\nfeel that is a far cry from some of their earlier pop\nrushes: 'It's dark in heaven baby, that's for sure.' isn't quite in the same category as 'I still love you, the girl\nfrom Mars,' galactic references aside.\nIt's not that they've lost their ability to churn out decent\npop singles that keep the punters happy. Current sin-g le, Jesus Says, proves that they can still rock out with\nthe best of them and provides the music marketplace\nwith another injection of pre-millenium tension. All\nthis musical anxiety can only be a good thing.\nDeath Trip 21 is the standout track. A sample that\nsounds similar to the screeching noise at the opening\nof Firestarter, general guitar thrashing and a midway\nfunky bassline to provide the calm before the storm all\ncome together with Wheeler's frenetic vocal delivery to\nprovide a satisfying ly climactic ending. Overall, it's an\nalbum of ebb and flow. There are nice quiet numbers\nwedged in between some more dark and introspective\nnumbers while there are still remains of what people\nsee as classic Ash. It's a good result. Well done boys!\nOh, and Charlotte, d Dennis\nSuperior - Faster Than You\nExcellent single from this female fronted group. Relax,\nturn up the volume and enjoy this breathlessly sexy, dark\nnumber which rises and increases to a satisfying end.\nUltrasound - /'// Show You Mine\nThe usual stuff: dreamy, majestic, ethereal, soaring\nand beautiful. There's an interesting sleeve note from\na clearly obsessed fan, \"Our love will strike at night dragging you naked and terrified to a romantic and glorious death.\" There used to be a time when fans were\necstatic to get spat on but now they're not content until\nthey've slaughtered and humiliated you!\nU2 - Sweetest Thing\nI Imm, how to advertise the Best of U2? Well, we could\nleak a report about a multi-gazillion dollar deal or we\ncould dredge up some rubbish from the archives. This\nwas originally intended for Joshua Tree but was probably incorrectly dismissed as shite. Optimistic and vulnerable, it's a step up from the more recent singles.\nRialto - Summers Over\n'Kamikaze seagull planes fighting over chip shop take-away remains.' Summer's Over deals with small seaside towns during said period of time. Would fit quite\nnicely on second half of Parklife. That's a good thing,\nby the way.\nFun Lovln' Criminals - Big Night Out\nAny band that can handle the chorus line, T got supermodels on my D,' without com busting with hilarity is\nfreezer cocktail cool. It's the usual 'Criminals style with\na mock 'hands together and sing along' ending.\nLodger - Small Change\nThe actual single here sucks like a White House\nemployee on speed. Track 2, Drunk, is fantastic and Eric\nis quirk i ly brilliant. Looks like the blok e in charge of track\norder decided he'd piss off for a pint instead.\nMansun - Negative\nWho actually buys this stuff? Answers on a postcard to\nFelix.\nNatalie Imbruglla - Smoke\nCutie Beauty Nat releases another one from Left of the\nMiddle. It's very good. Much more intense than previous singles and consequently more appealing. Not\nbad going for a bird off some Australian soap.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Placebo-You Don't Care About Us\nWell scrape me off the stick, cover me in chilli sauce and\nsalad and wrap me up in pitta bread because I'm ready\nto go! Sometimes a record is in your face and it's all\nabout right here ana right now. Frighteningly ex hil a rating. Pass me that black eyeliner! El\nDennis\nIdlewlld -I Am a Message\nIdlewild have been much touted as the best thing to\ncome out of Glasgow since Teenage Fanclub. I'm afraid\nthey don't live up to this reputation with / am a Message which features trademark distorted guitars (sound-ing pretty weak it has to be said) and fairly weak lyrics\nalongside.\nAudioweb - Gef Out of Here\nCarrying on with the cop theme, started first with\n'Policeman Skank', Audioweb use sampled sirens on this\nbrilliant new track with lead singer Martin doing his usual\nmix of rag ga and his smooth, less than deep vocals.\nMonkey Mafia - Work Ml Body\nThis was originally released a few years back but does-n't sound at all dated. Tracks like this need to be re-released to remind us that 'Big Beat' still sounds pretty\nfresh, even though many people are in a hurry to disown it.\nSnowpony- John Brown\nIt contains a sample from the 'I lustier' and its funked\nout groove is forced along by a marching drum beat. The singer's voice is an acquired taste and her vocal\nmelody tends to ruin the tune.\nSwervedrlver - Wrong Treats\nThis track was recorded a longtime ago, back in December '96 but it's only seeing the light of day nearly two\nyears later. It's pretty typical of Swervedriver with their\nusual use of distorted guitars but doesn't live up to their\nprevious release 99th Dream.\nThe Dub Pistols - Cyclone\nThis is a tune to get you jumping up to, and probably\ncould be classed in the same league as Lionrock but\nladen with more energy, the verse s oud s reminiscent\nof De La Soul but the chorus dispels any lack of originality. BJork- Hunter\nThis is the opening track from Bjork's third album\n/ lom o geni c. It sounds a little too similar to one of Portishead's songs from Dummy and is a pretty clear picture of / lom o geni c as a whole: dark and oppressive.\nGel - Catching Ants\nThis is pop and at the same time thrashed out indie,\nplayed by a four piece from reading with an age range\nsimilar to Ash when they first started off. The title is\npretty lame and the same can be said about the song\ntoo. E3\nJason\n\n"

Good work f el las!\nAfter close examination of this\nesteemed publication I noticed that\nsome of the Union's Clubs & Societies\nhad not submitted articles, but had still\nmanaged to gain a mention in the Handbook under a section named \"Missing\nClubs\" on page 70 of section 3. I wish\nto draw the Handbook editors' attention\nto the remaining Union Clubs & Societies that have been omitted - this list\nincludes all of Medical School Students'\nUnion Clubs, the Departmental Societies,\nthe Motor Clubs and other Societies run\nby the Union such as the Astronomical\nSociety.\nIf I were a naive random I would be\nnone the wiser - as far as I would be con-cern ed, these Clubs & Societies were\nnon-existent. I low ever, I am not. They\ndo exist and any member of Imperial College Union can join them. So why did\nthey not have their written articles published in the ICU Il and book? Why don't they even have their names printed in\nthe section concerned? I know that\nmany of these Clubs & Societies did submit articles to the Felix Office well in\nadvance of the copy deadline.\nAs far as I am aware, 'Editorial Freedom' only applies to newsletters and\npapers and not to handbooks and the\nlike -1 would never have second thoughts\nabout barring any articles from a hand-book, even if I did have reservations\nabout the person who ran the Club or the\nClub itself ICU likes to pride itself over\nthe number of Clubs that it runs, but yet\nwhen it comes to the crunch obviously\ncannot be bothered to publicise some of\nthem - considering how much time and\neffort that these people put into their\nClubs & Societies, I think that future handbook editors should rethink this unfair\npolicy.\nOn a lighter note, I wish every success to all parts of the Union for the\ncoming year.\nYours faithfully,\nRob Park\nImmediate Past ICU RAG Chair\nI 've had a few letters like this (and posters\nin the case of TC Ultimate Frisbee Club'),\nso...\nAs far as I am concerned, there Is no\n'policy regarding barring clubs' articles\nfrom the handbook. I cannot speak for\nmy predecessor and he can't comment,\nas he's currently up a mountain in Nepal.\nI am quite happy to have all clubs In next\nyear's handbook, although such a comprehensive section will reduce the space\navailable for each club.\nAs for the 'missing clubs' section, all\nI can say Is that the list of ICU clubs Is vast\nand constantly changing, and it Is possible that the one Jeremy was working\nfrom was not up to date.\nFinally, AstroSoc have contacted me\nand are being mentioned now, as has\nthe C& GU Motor Club. I have yet to\nhere a complaint from the ICSM President Wade Gayed... - Ed\nAttention all BIDS Users!\nBIDS to ATHENS Username change\nYour BIDS username and password expired on the 31st of August.\nI low ever, you should have received your ATHENS username and password by\nemail, with the following subject heading:\nATHENS Personal Account created\nI his may be used to access all BIDS and NISS services\nYour ATI IENS username will normally be a variant of your Imperial College\nemail login name.\nEg: icl jbl ogg s However, your password will NOT automatically be your email password.\nFor security reasons you are advised to change your ATI IENS password as soon\nas possible after receiving it by email.\nWe recommend that you do not change it to your College email password.\nTo change your password, go to http://adm ln. athens.ac.uk/personal.at html Please contact your Department/Campus Librarian if you need further assistance\nAndy, We Love You!\nDear Editor\nHaving read your first edition, and Simon\nBaker's column in the last issue of Felix,\nI felt I had to write in about our dearly\ndeparted President Andy Heeps.\nWhen Andy was elected in November last year (on the fourth occasion,\nremember), I was one of the first people\nto groan \"oh my god, a medic\". As far as\nI was concerned (and your predecessor)\nthe medics had finally called our bluff,\nand placed a yes-man in to do their evil\nways.\nI low ever, the truth panned out very\ndifferently. Mr Ile eps proved himself to\nbe an able, sincere President (the first for\na long time), one who looked out for his\nmembers above himself and fought our\nbattles brilliantly.\nIn his eight short months at the\nhelm, I found the Union to be suddenly\ngripped by a realisation that it was our\nrepresentatives who ran the place, not\njust the permanent staff. I observed four\nsessions of Council during Andy's term,\nand saw a strong leader who believed\nabove all in accountability back to us; the\npeople who paid his wage.\nLast week, you revealed how Andy\nsecured a Welfare sabbatical for ICU.\nThat particular battle has been fought by\nevery President since 1990, with even the\nmighty Eric Allsop failing to achieve success. Yet our man the medic took it in his\nstride, winning people over, doing whatever negotiation was necessary to\nachieve his goal. For those of you who\nenjoy the new dB's, give a thought to\nAndy who had to jump through hoops at\nthe College's highest committees to get\nDeadline for letters is\n12noon Wednesday.\nLetters may be edited\nfor length, but will not\nbe altered in any other\nway.

The football team also showed gratitude, and I know that if it weren't for Andy's persistence, the fantastic IC Summer Ball would\nnever have come about.\nMembers of staff have told me that\nthe Rector and other denizens of suite 5\ndisliked Heeps, and I can see why. It is\neasy to ignore a student who whines and\nmoans about conditions in College, it is\nless easy to ignore valid argument and\ndebate.\nAndy had his bad points; the BUSA\ndual entry debate showed his weak-ness es, but to his credit he acknowledged the will of ICU Council, and\nworked to compromise with them. The\nresult is the best possible for Imperial College and the rest of the country.\nI think we all owe to Andy to say\n\"sorry for doubting you, thank you for all\nyou have done\". I le is in the unenviable\nposition of being an undergraduate for\nanother 3 years,- he has to see others\ndoing his job.\nGood luck Andy; Dave Hellard has an\nimpossible act to follow.\nYours faithfully\nD Robinson\nPhysics PostGrad\nKttP THE CAT IRQ MR LST. 1949\nThe Week Ahead\nMonday\nFilm Meeting 1.30 pm\nFor all film reviewers wanting preview\ntickets...\nDeadline for advertising for Issue 1172\nTuesday\nNews Meeting 1.30 pm\nFor all news writers and researchers\nWednesday\nDeadline for letters for Issue 112212pm Layout and Finishing 6pm to ???am\nNot recommended for the uninitiated.\nThursday\nNews Meeting 1.30 pm\nFoi all news writers, researchers and\nphotographers\n\n"

    "content": "20 Film 12 October 1998\nReviews\nThe Truman Show * * * \u2022 \u2022\nStarring : Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, Laura Linney\nDirector: Peter Weir\nM any reviewers have focused on\nThe Truman Show as a dramatic turn around in Jim Carrey's career - proof that he really can cut It as\na serious actor. This creates the impression that this is a masterpiece of modern film-making, a serious moral drama\ninvestigating the power of TV. Yet this\nsimply isn't true - The Truman Show is a brilliant example of near perfect film\nmaking, but for different reasons.\nFirst of all, forget any film made in\nthe last twenty years. Truman has far\nmore In common with the Hollywood of\nthe thirties and forties than the mega-bucks methods of today. Think back to\nthe days of Cary Grant and James Stewart and classic feelgood movies like It's A Wonderful Life, and you're in the right\nkind of territory. Truman's model home,\nthe idyllic town of Seahaven, his perfect\nlife and perfect wife combine to produce a stunning tech nicol our rendition\nof a fifties dream world. There's no crime,\nno swearing, no violence - it's the\nUtopian world of public information\nbroadcasts.\nOf course, it's all too good to be true.\nSince the sixties, The Truman Show has\nbeen the highest rated show on US tele-vision. It's a twenty-four hour, non stop\nsoap opera, that's run for over thirty\nyears without a single break. In that time,\nthe world has seen Its eponymous star\ntake his first step, say his first word, journey through school and college and\neventually marry. The catch? The programme exists unbeknownst to Truman.\nThe entire town in which he lives is a set.\nEvery person he knows, everyone he\nhas ever met is an actor.\nTo stop Truman from escaping, a series of obstacles have been contrived\n- his fear of crossing water, leaks at the\nnuclear power plant, forest fires and so\nforth - which constrain him to his fictional\nhome. To all intents and purposes he is\na prisoner in paradise. But he's happy -in director Weir's own words, \"We all\naccept the reality with which we're pre-sent ed\" until a series of bizarre in ci dents, coupled with the strange loss of\na lost love cat a lys esa rebellion within our\nhero....\nA nice enough Idea in principle, the\nbeauty is in its execution. Although in\nhindsight it's probably a very cheesy,\nultimately predictable movie, Peter Weir\ncreates a character who you can't help\nbut route for. Like Carrey, the Australian\ndirector has also undergone a dramatic\ncareer reversal thanks to The Truman\nShow. Although no stranger to star veh i cles, his previous work has generally covered far more \"adult\" themes - Witness,\nOallipolli, Dead Poets Society and The\nMosquito Coast stand as cases in point.\nAbove all, it's Carrey's showcase performance that drives the film towards\nclassic status. Amidst his utterly unreal\nsurroundings, he manages to remain\ntotally believable, an average, everyday\nguy, struggling to discover the truth of\nwhat's going on around him, never daring to believe the full nature of the corporate universe that surrounds him. Not\nonly every scene he appears in, but the\nentire movie revolves around his performance and ultimately relies on him for\nits success.\nThe key point, however, is that it\nisn'ta deliberately startling performance.\nIt isn't in Carrey's nature to exude the\npresence of de Niro or Pacino, so instead\nhis past roles have seen him resort to big-laugh physical comedy (The Mask, Liar,\nLiar, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and the like). However, as Truman, Carrey manages to own every scene he appears in,\nwithout any of the usual tricks. Whilst the\ncomedy remains - don't let any of the\npublicity fool you into thinking this a laugh-free zone - Carrey executes it with\nmuch lighter strokes, letting the writer\nand director do the work for him. As a result, he never seems to be forcing the\nlaughs, never struggles to find the\nhumour in an obviously mundane situ a tion. Sure he has his clich es and catch-phrases, but then don't we all. The\nimportant point is that he never drives\nthem into your head like a game-show\nhost. It's the massive fictional audience,\nnot Truman, who raise his favourite sayings to cult status. At the end of the day,\nTruman isn'ta star. He doesn't know -and Carrey must make us believe he\ndoesn't know - that anyone is watching\nhim, or even taking an interest in him.\nPut together, The Truman Show is a timeless piece of cinema. Whilst Ed Harris (Apollo 13, The Rock) - cast perfectly\nagainst type as the camp, beret-wearing\ncreator of the show - explains the Captain Scarlett style technology used to\nkeep Truman under constant sur veil lance, in an attempt to give the film\nsome nineties feel, the story itself could\nsit happily at any point in the last half-century. Although on the surface there arc\nsome moral questions raised over the\ngrowing power of the mass media to\ncontrol our lives, that is by no means the\ntrue thrust of the film. It's simply a classic tale of the strength of human will\nwhen faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle.\nThe relative successes of The Truman\nShow and some of this Summer's all-action outings should finally send the\nmessage to Hollywood that well thought\nout, well written movies can be successful. OK, so this time next year we'll\nprobably have to put up with an endless\nstream of Truman rip-offs, but maybe -just maybe - the unlikely combination of\nWeir and Carrey could herald the return\nof old-style values to movie-making.\nQuite simply, that's how good this movie\nis. Cllched as it may be, I feel compelled\nto say it: If you only see one movie this\nyear, then make sure it's The Truman\nShow. D Dave\n\n"

Eddie is flashing his new logo and layout designs\naround on trial pages featuring nonsense Underworld lyrics, and strange\nphilosophical theories based around\nteapots. The pages look rather fetching.\nWe've got until tomorrow lunchtime to\nfinish the middle four sheets. I agree to\nstay and do a bit of layout.\nFelix 1-0 Fate\nearly evening\nIt's taken a good couple of hours of\nmessing about to get a one-page fresh-ers' feature printed. The computers are\nbeing insubordinate again. The kettle\ngoes on. We smile for a short period. I notice the time. We abort the cup of tea\nand start on the columns. I couldn't possibly leave yet. There's too much to do.\nFelix 1\n-1 Fate\nnight\nThought for the Day and Voice of Reason\nare on the paste-up sheets. There's two\npages of maps and codes for the fresh-ers' fair left to do, plus some adverts, and\na cover page. Myself, Eddie and ex-edi-tor Jeremy head back to Ed's house to fix\nthe dod gy maps Neil O 'Shaughnessy has\ngiven us.\nFelix 1-2 Fate\nMonday 28 September\nsmall hours\nNo sleep yet. Eddie finds that one of the\ndisks with a map on is corrupted. I take\nthe disk out and scientifically hit it a few\ntimes against the desk. The disk works.\nVital time is recovered. A large sigh of\nrelief contributes to global warming.\nFelix 2-2 Fate\n8 a.m. Both of us are, as Wilfred Owen put it,\n\"...drunk with fatigue.\" The laborious creation of several hundred text boxes to\nmake the maps readable is complete.\nThe fresher s' fair guide is on the paste-up sheets. Eddie fiddles with the careers\nfeature and the adverts. I'm very tired,\nbut we're definitely getting there.\nFelix 3-2 Fate\n10 a.m. Two plates are supposed to be at the\nprinters'. We prat about, writing on random objects and arranging them in the\nscanner to make a tasteful cover for the\nfresher s' guide. Precious seconds tick\naway. Finally the cover page is finished\nand pasted up. It was done in half an\nhour, and sadly shows it. Eddie disappears to the printer. I go home and go\nto bed.\nFelix 3-3 Fate\nTuesday 29 September\nlunchtime\nI drag myself out of bed and back into\nthe office. We've had some sleep, but\nnow have an even bigger task ahead -the remaining twenty-four pages. I get on\nthe 'phone to Matt Hyde, ULU President,\nand begin writing the front-page story\nabout the new LT Students' card. I ask\nhim why ULU is so useless. It's fun. I like\nthis job.\nlate afternoon\nThe front-page is half full. We're satisfied\nwith the story.

The end is in\nsight.\nFelix 4-4 Fate\nten to midnight\nMusic and Games are finished. I 've done\nthe back page. Eddie is pasting up\nadverts. Just news to go, with a few\nhours until the print deadline. We're shattered and hallucinating, but we're gonna\nmake it.\nFelix 54 Fate\nmidnight\nSecurity arrive and announce a four-hour\npower cut, effective immediately. Eddie\nfaints. We begin dismantling the server\nto take the hard disk home, but are scuppered by the incompatibility of NTFS. We\ngive up, go back to Ed's, and write news\nfor four hours, while muttering darkly\nunder our breath.\nFelix 5\n-5 Fate\nWednesday 30 September\n6 a.m. Ed is struggling through his first editorial.\nI am laying out news and sport; scanning\nadverts; touching up the music and arts\nsections,- writing bylines; tweaking pictures and proofing articles. We're not\ngoing to finish. It's going to be late. The\nprinter jams.\nFelix 5-6 Fate\nEddie has taken five plates to the print-ers'. We've missed the print deadline on\nour first issue. I go to bed and sleep for\nmany days.\nFriday 2 October\nmorning\nFelix hits the streets. It's all over, and out\non time. We've beaten Fate. The process\nof rebuilding our tattered lives begins...\nFelix 4500-6 Fate\nAll Campbell\nA long long time ago, In a hospital far far away ....\nWelcome back to the new and improved\nImperial College of Medicine and other\nvaguely related subjects. Yes I 've temporarily been promoted from writing\ninsulting letters to writing insulting art i cles. To some of you who have been kind\nenough to say that you were amused by\nmy previous offerings this may be a good\nthing and for those of you who were not\namused, tough, but do keep up the\nthreatening letters.\nA special welcome to all of you out\ntheir who have struggled through the\nemotional minefield of UCAS and have\nfinally won the right to be little fish in a big pond again by becoming fresher s. We have all been there before and from\nthe fragments that I remember and the\nlibellous stories that have been spread\nabout me I had a great time.\nThere is, of course, a particularly special group of fresher s, those deemed\nworthy of a place reading medicine. Provided that you don't do too much reading you'll enjoy yourselves. Imperial\ndoesn't really know what you are like just\nyet and if you don't tell them then I promise that I won't either. As far as the\nbringing together (I have gone off the\nword merger) of the two most Illustrious\nof the London medical schools' goes, its\ngone, and quite successfully. Over the\nlast week CX went to SMI I and vice versa\nand since no one can remember details\nof what happened on any of these mixed\noccasions I have to assume that everything went very well.\nMoving on to other matters the new\nimproved ICSTM boasts a working\n(almost) Alexander Fleming building. Do\nnot worry that you won't all be able to fit\nin the lecture theatre because once you\nare in the sound is a bit dod gy, so you\nprobably won't hear anything anyway\nand unless you sit at the back you cannot see anything. An addition to the outrageously technology heavy theatre is the\nseats. After a few false starts working out\nhow to sit on them you'll find that comfortable though they certainly are if you\ntry to rest on the desk in front to have\nforty winks to try and overcome the previous night's excess, you can't. Cunning\ndesign or Irritating design flaw, I will\nleave you to decide after you have taken\nthem for a test drive.\nFinally, to prove that I have not totally\nmellowed over the summer, I will say a few words on my favourite subject. In the\nbest traditions of Imperial College, after\nexhaustive efforts to find a competent\nunion team they have promptly thrown\nthem all out. I have sympathy for those\nwho have had to alter their career plans\nand wish them well in wherever they\nhave headed off to. Their departure does\nmean that there will be elections this\nterm and because certain members of\nthe IC team are gluttons for punishment\nthey have brought up the sticky subject\nof block voting. I never truly understood\nwhat the fuss was when non-medics out\nnumbered the medics by about ten to\none. Possibly the embarrassing humiliation of being wound around the little fingers of St Mary's quite so easily upset\none or two of the more vocal members\nof the College. Who knows? The point is\nthat elections are coming up and to the\nnew year I can only say join in rather than\nsit on the side lines and complain\nbecause frankly that just gets boring after\na while.\nMICK NEWTOH\n\n"

Jimmy's Mummy,\nwho was called Mummy, was worried\nabout Jimmy and often sent him to the\ndoctor. Jimmy didn't mind because he\nknew he was all right. Even though people sometimes looked at him oddly when\nhe and Jimmy would rush around and\nJimmy (not the cheese) would yell:\n/ am the boy with the piece of cheese,\nMy friend is as yellow as you please,\nIf I wear black,\nwe look like a bumble be ez. He would shout this until his\nMummy would say she thought it would\nbe better if he was quiet. And belt him\nwith her broomstick. This made Jimmy\nsad but his friend, the cheese, would\nsoon cheer him up by being so bright\nand yellow.\nOne day Jimmy had a good chance to\nshow his Mummy and the doctor that it\nwasn't silly to be best friends with a lump\nof Cheddar. In fact, he could probably\nhave shown that being friends with a dairy product was more useful than having more conventional human friends.\nOn this day, Jimmy was walking along\nwith his pal humming a little tune:\nToasted truffles and strawberry Jam,\nAre nice.\nNicer than spam\nAnd nicer than rice.\nI would eat all I can\nBut I have to give them to the mice.\nWho otherwise would eat my cheese.\nHis Mummy didn't like him humming this much either but she wasn't around. Jimmy was walking to the zoo.\nHe was pretending that this was a big\nadventure, but he had been before. So\nit wasn't really. He thought the zoo was\nlike a big hotel for all the animals who\ncould come and stay to look at the people and see what they got up to. Most of\nall he liked the Hippos and the Stick\ninsects. He liked the Hippos because\nthey didn't have any sharp corners, so\nyou couldn't cut yourself on them. He\nliked the stick insects because they\nlooked like sticks.\nEven though he liked the Hippos so\nmuch, first of all he went to see the\nlions. To save the best till last. Some\nother children were looking at the Hons\ntoo. The lions all lived in a big pit. Jimmy\nthough that maybe lions weren't as rich\nas the other animals as their place was-n't as good as the others. Only by looking up could they see all the people thay\nwere meant to be looking at. And Hons\ndon't seem to like looking up very much.\nThen Jimmy thought that perhaps lions\nwere as rich as all the other animals, it\nwas just that they were a bit mean. For\nsome reason, (Jimmy knew there was\nalways a reason for things. But his cheese\nprobably didn't), there was only one lion\nin the lion pit. It was very big and yellow.\nIt didn't look very big as it was such a long way down below our hero, it looked\nabout the size of a bar of soap. I low ever it did look very angry. It kept going 'growl'\nand swishing its tail.\nThere was a zookeeper standing\nnear Jimmy, looking at the Hon. He was\nwearing a blue hat, (the zookeeper that\nis, not the lion or Jimmy). Jimmy thought\nthat zookeepers were like policemen.\nJimmy asked him what was wrong with\nthe lion. The man said that the Hon was\nin a bad mood and it wasn't helping\nthat the children were dropping peanuts\non it. Jimmy asked the zookeeper if he\ncould sing a song to the Hon to cheer it\nup. The zookeeper said he thought that\nwas a good idea and went off to tell the\nchildren not to throw peanuts. Jimmy\nsang to the lion:\nLions live in Africa,\nExcept for you\nYou live in Chipping-causes.\nSo do I But my house is nicer than yours is.\nThe lion didn't seem to hear this. He\ndidn't look any happier either. Jimmy\nsaw that the lion didn't listen much to\nwhat went on above his house. SoJimmy\ndevised a brilliant pian to talk to the Hon\na bit better. He climbed over the railing\nand jumped down into the lion's pit.\nThis was a very big drop and Jimmy could\nhave been hurt very badly. Luckily he\nlanded on the lion. The zookeeper\nstarted shouting and the Hon didn't look\npleased either. In fact the lion jumped up\nand took a huge bite out of Jimmy. He\nrolled him around on the floor and then\nate him all up.\nJimmy was surprised. He didn't know\nlions liked cheese. The zookeeper rushed\ninto the pit. I le looked very white and\nwas holding a long stick. He grabbed\nJimmy by the shoulder and told him he\nwas lucky to still be in one piece. He said\nlions were quite vicious and didn't like\nbeen landed on. The zookeeper started\nto drag Jimmy through the door, out of\nthe pit. But Jimmy wasn't very happy, he\nsaid he didn't much like his best friends\nbeen eaten.\nHe struggled free from the\nzookeeper. I le took a big run up and\nsummoning up surprising speed and\nstrength, booted the Hon on the nose.\n\n"

In\nthe end it was finished barely hours\nbefore the official handover ceremony\nbut, on Friday 2 October, those involved\nIn the project assembled in the new\nlounge, and 'there was no sign of wet\npaint. The evening started badly, how-ever, as a college Finance Leaving Party\nhijacked the bar, apparently mistaking it\nfor their venue. They even drank the free\nwine on offer for those involved with the\nproject. Once they were removed, and\na few minor technical problems sorted\nout, proceedings could begin, lan Caldwell, Director of Estates, thanked the\nbuilders, designers and constructors\ninvolved with the.project, before talking\nmore generally about Union-College collaboration on building projects: \"We are\ntrying to get the best for students\" he\ncommented. Going on to discuss other\nbuilding projects around college Mr Caldwell said that \"hopefully the BMS will be\nfinished... soon\". Exactly how soon he\nhoped it would be finished was not spec-if i ed. Dave Hellard, ICU President, also\npraised those involved with the project,\ncommenting \"we couldn't have done\nthis project without the [college] design\noffice\", but emphasised the work put in\nby Union staff to get the new venue up\nand running for Freshers' Week. In a show of confidence he declared \"we\nare the best university in the country...\nDazed on Monday night at the Freshers' Ball\nSaying it with Flowers\nby Tony Ofori\nThe introduction of shrubbery outside\nthe BMS building and adjacent to the\nbookshop is likely to cost in excess of\n\u00a3110,000. According to lan Caldwell,\nDirector of Estates, the intention is that\nthis will enhance the aesthetic attraction\nof the College.\nThree trees will be put up in front of\nBMS and a flower bed (approx. 3 m by\n60m) is to be planted next to the Waterstone's bookshop. This alone will cost an\nestimated \u00a360,000 (this figure covers the\ntotal cost of the planting, from paving to\nflowers): The flowerbed will mean that\napproximately 10 parking spaces will be\nlost. Potentially, this could cost the College an estimated \u00a350,000 per year\nthrough lost revenue. This comes in the\nwake of the discovery that an extra \u00a35m for unexpected costs has been pumped\ninto the \u00a360m BMS building. All of this\nThe sort of quality plant\nEstates must be paying for\nmoney is taken from central College\nfunds, meaning that less is available for\nother activities.\nImperial College is not exactly alive\nwith exotic flowers and flamboyant trees.\nIn fact there is a distinct grey ness about\nthe place. However, it is debatable\nwhether incorporating flowers and trees\nover such a small localised area will\nenhance the appearance of the College.\nMr. Caldwell claims that the increased\ngreenery will \"attract more investors and\nstudents to the College\". I le also adds\nthat they are in line with stringent landscape regulations.\nIt is rumoured that one reason for\nthe setup is the arrival of the Queen to\nofficially open the BMS building in two\nweeks time, but it is doubtful whether\nthe new trees and shrubs will be planted\nin time.\nThe more cynical economists will\ninsist that there is no point in such a horticultural venture that costs so much but\ncovers so little; however many claim that\nthis floral addition is a necessary step\ntowards improving the campus' environment. socially, as well\".\nTickets for Freshers' Events were sold\nin record times. Over 450 Ents Cards\nwere bought, compared to around 200\nin previous years, which could have led\nto licencing problems on the Comedy\nNight if every Ents card holder had turned\nup. Fortunately many of them didn't make it as far as the Union that night.\nThe carnival sold out a full day and a half\nearlier than usual. Meanwhile there\nwere problems with medics' ents cards,\napparently caused by a lack of organisation on the part of their Union. On the\napplication form sent out to all new medical fresher s there was no return address,\nnor was a pick up point for the ents card\nspecified. The result was that many of\nthe forms were returned to ICU's office\ninstead Of the medics' Union, and many\nfresher s did not have the cards by the Ball\ncame on Monday night.

    "content": "16 Arts Feature 12 October 1998\nTheatre on the cheap Cheap theatre?\nYou must\nRemember the days when you could leave\nhome with ate nner, go to the theatre, buy\na slap up meal and still have change for\nthe bus fare home? As far as Matt Williams\nis concerned, they still exist\nSo, Freshers week has finished, you've spent\nyour food money for the term, put serious\ndents in your grant cheque, can't wait for\nyour student loan to get approved and you're trying to find something interesting to do in London\nthat won't mean you've got to be at the bank the following morning filling In the free overdraft\napplication form. Or am I being a bit optimistic?\nWell, if you've spent the last week or so being\nseriously abused by loud music, sampling copious amounts of ale and living on a diet of pro-plus and coffee, and now fancy something a bit\ndifferent; something artistically (and dare I say\nintellectually) challenging, then maybe it's about\ntime you discovered what the vast number of\ntheatres and venues in London has to offer.\nDespite what you might think going out to the\ntheatre in London does not have to be expensive\nprovided you are willing to do a bit of preparation\nor to just take your chances. Neither does it have\nto be solely for middle class 'lu wie s' who did so\n\"revel in Berkoff's second act which marvelled\namidst...\" etc. Many of the top theatres in London\ndo student standbys (don't be afraid to flog those\nUnion cards for all the money they're worth) or\nsmaller fringe venues might do mid-week offers.\nWhatever your tastes, I'm sure it is possible to find\nsomething out there to suit everyone whatever\nyour budget or occasion so .... read on.\nT he first things to consider are the big West\nEnd shows. If you haven't yet been to see\none then I'm sure that sometime in your\nfew years here you'll at least be tempted to go\nand sit amidst the throng of gathered tourists in\nthe heart of the West-End. As far as getting relatively cheap tickets goes, you've got a number of\noptions available depending on the time you've\ngot spare and finances. One of the best places to\nget tickets is the 'Half Price Ticket' booth at the\nbottom of Leicester Square In the little clock\ntower type-of-thing. Here they sell tickets at half\ntheir marked price (who'd have guessed that?)\nfor performances that day. There Is nothing\ndod gy or fake about the tickets on sale here - it\nis all perfectly legal and above board. They take\ncash only and are open from 12pm to 6.30pm(3 pm on Sundays) and tickets are limited to 2\npairs per person. The problem is that they can't guarantee what tickets will be available and\ndon't get tickets for all of the shows running in\nthe West End (Phantom and Les Mis are two who\ndon't currently subscribe). It can also be prone\nto large queues during the summer months\nwhen it's prime tourist time. However, if you're\nflexible about what you want, have some spare\ntime in the afternoon and want to see some of\nthe bigger shows In London, then this could be\nideal.\nAnother possibility is to try going to the theatres themselves. It is quite usual for a number of\nreturn tickets to be available for each performance at lower prices provided your willing to take\nyour chances queuing to get them. Each theatre\nwill have its own policy on how they run this so\nit's best to check with them about prices, best\ntimes to start queuing, and usual numbers of\ntickets available. If there's a show that you really\nwant to go and see and is near the end of it's run\nthen this is certainly a possibility, but is probably\nfor the more 'hardcore' amongst you. Instead you\ncould try getting balcony tickets which, although\nsometimes a long way from the stage, still provide\nadequate sight and sound if you've still got all your\nfaculties about you. Some of the seats might not\nbe the most comfortable or suitable for those suffering from vertigo but in my opinion these provide a better alternative to restricted view tickets\nwhere vo u walk out with a bent neck and sore\nback having missed all the visual gags on one half\nof the stage due to the large pillar in front of you.\nTickets range from about the \u00a37 mark for both balcony and restricted view seats but this can vary\ngreatly between shows.\nFlashing lots of student ID can also work in\nplaces like this, but it tends to depend on theatres,\ndays of the week, and times of the day. One place\nthat I highly recommend is the National Theatre.\nThis often has great shows with big name actors\nand they offer Student Standbys at \u00a37.50 45 minutes before the start of each performance. There's12 October 1998 Arts Feature 17\nTheatre on the cheap In the West End?\nbe joking.\nno guarantee of availability of tickets, but you can\nend up with the best seats in the house at a bargain price. They normally have a number of shows\non in a variety of theatres at one time, so if you\nmake the trip over there you're fairly safe in finding something left - unless you choose a weekend or the start/end of a run.\nN ext in line you've got the 'Off-West End'\ntheatres, in my experience this classification has got a lot less to do with location\nthan the title might suggest (they might be in the\nheart of town or out by the river), but more to do\nwith programming, prices and size. These theatres are usually smaller, and can often be very\ninteresting, sometimes giving the first showings\nto plays that then go on to be hugely successful.\nIt can be a great place to sample new writing,\nwitness adventurous directing or just see something that sounds amazing. Boundaries for theatres that fall into this category are often blurred,\nbut places such as the Donmar Warehouse, Royal\nCourt, and Riverside Studios are probably some of\nthe better-known venues amongst them. Shows\nhere can be really good - the Donmar Warehouse\ncurrently has Nicole Kidman there (don't bother\ntrying to get tickets - I read one article saying\nthey were worth \u00a31000 a pair and returns are\nextremely rare) and the Royal Court had the first\nshowing of Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and\nFucking (With optional asterisks for the more con-serva ti ve). Offers for students here are plentiful and\ngood, with concession prices rarely going above\n\u00a36 and sometimes as low as 10p. The Royal Court\ndoes a limited number of 'Standing' tickets at 10p each night, which go on offer 1 hour before each\nperformance, and in my experience they'll only\nforce you to stand if there are absolutely no seats\nleft (sometimes there's a bench available). Certainly\nworth considering if you're out at the theatre frequently. They also do special offers on Mondays\nand matinee s. Also watch out for venues that run 'Pay-what-you-can' nights. Battersea Arts Centre, just across\nthe river, operates this policy on Tuesday nights for\nsome shows (check the listings) and although\nthey're perfectly happy to take 20p off you for the\nticket, a few quid might ease your conscience a lit-tle, as well as helping them to sustain such a great\nopportunity to let people experience the theatre.\nKeeping an eye open, reading 'Time Out' and\nbeing impulsive is probably the best way to get\naround this market place, but the rewards can be\nrich.\nFinally there's the Fringe. If the West End is\nthe heart of theatre in London then the\nFringe is certainly the soul. The word 'Fringe'\nis used to categorise so many different types of\nevents and theatres that it is impossible to go\nthrough all of them here. Venues live on the top\nof pubs, in warehouses, or under churches - and\nthe levels of performances vary almost as much.\nI 've seen here probably the best and most inspiring productions that I 've ever seen, and at the\nsame time some of the weakest and worst. That's what the Fringe is, and that's what it lives on..\nThere is no hard guide as to what you must see,\nwhere you must go, and there is no guarantee at\nall to what you'll get - but by taking a degree of\nadvice and a bit of trial and error you'll soon work\nout what it is you like.\nCertainly one of the best places to get information is 'Time Out'. Every week it is packed with\nlistings of what is going on at the fringe venues,\nas well as prices, time, and a fairly good guide to\nwhat is (or isn't) worth seeing. Prices tend to exist\naround the \u00a35 mark for concessions and sometimes there might be offers available on certain\nnights of the week. There are venues within walking distance from College and halls (Kings Road,\nChelsea, and Notting Hill) so if you see something you might like, or fancy something different\nthen it could be worth a go. Fringe theatre does-n't appeal to everyone, but that doesn't mean\nyou won't like it, and neither does it mean that it's only meant for theatre going types. Normally it's the unusual, challenging and different stuff that\nfinds it way onto the fringe and this can mean it\nnot only achieves a lot more, but can also attract\nmany more different types.\nSo I guess that's about all I can suggest off\nhand. This is by no way a definitive guide to what\nis available, but it really is only meant to show you\nwhat is possible - the rest is up to you. There is\nsuch a wide variety on offer in so many different\nareas that it is impossible to tell you everything ...\nI haven't even touched on the fact that the English National Opera do tickets for \u00a32.50, and then\nthere's dance and music and .... etc etc. Ifyou want\nto just try it once or maybe be a frequent visitor to\nthe theatres, then London certainly has it all to\noffer. There is, of course, one way of going to see\nshows regularly for absolutely no money at all, and\nthat's to join the arts section of Felix. In return for\na short review, preview or press tickets that we can\nmanage to get could be yours. Plus you get to see\nyour name in print - what more could you possibly want? Just drop into the office anytime. Good\nluck, and happy hunting.\n\n"

Well this 'game'\nisn't for you. If instead you have a horrendous craving to look after something\nthat has some of the irritations of a pet\nbut can't get you arrested for continuous\ncruel torturing then read on. Right having got rid of most of you I 'll continue.\nEssentially this is a bigger version of\ncreatures, the virtual pet program. You\nstill have to hatch out the eggs into little\nfurry little bundles of fun, teach them to\nspeak, eat and be inquisitive. Then when\nyou've got enough you can watch them\nbreed (well not in any detail) and develop\na new generation of hopefully slightly\nmore interesting and intelligent fur balls.\nIla ving no paternal instincts at all I left my charges to eat and wander about\nthe world as they pleased and this probably explains why none of them survived\ninto adulthood. Fred and Alice died of\nstarvation on a little island. Bob drowned\nand poor Vic just wandered off and by\nthe time I got back from a toilet break\nwas found face down pushing up the\ndaises. But should you want to care for\nthem you can teach them using a simple computer, you can then force them\nto go and eat the food generated by the\nlittle ecosystem. You can also open up\nyour medical bag and treat them for various diseases, check their health and\nmess about with their fertility. All good\nfun for those potential parents and Nazi\ndoctors keen on starting your own master race of furry creatures.\nIf you have an internet connection\nyou can even force others to see the\nfamily photos of your little friends and\nswap eggs to prevent your creatures\nfrom becoming the furry equivalent of\ninbred hillbillies. All good clean fun but\nonly slightly more interesting than watching grass grow, and that's the problem.\nYou have the choice of stopping and\nwatching every character, which\nbecomes tedious in the extreme, or you\nwalk away and come back to find them\ndead. So in summary it's one for those\nwho like interactive screen savers, have\nheart conditions and can not allow themselves to get too excited, or those who\nlike torturing small creatures but the\nRSPCA prevent them from keeping anything that breathes.

    "content": "12 October 1998 Music 19\nilia Bomb!\nWHATS UPll Ya regular dose of hip hop and R&B is back\nwith the news and reviews!\nWhat's Up! After a wicked summer (way too short) college is back and The Bomb has returned to bring you\nthe low down on the R&B and hip-hop world.\nThe biggest news of the summer was the\nannouncement that Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey\nare going to hook up to record a gospel flavoured duet\nWhen You Believe as the theme for the animated film\n'The Prince Of Egypt'. The song will be produced by\nBabyface and if I was him my major concern would be\nfinding a studio big enough for these two massive egos.\nJust before the end of term last year Brandy and\nMonica collaborated to produce the stunning The Boy\nis Mine, and most people thought this meant they had\ngot over their problems; no way, the young divas still\nhate each other. Everyone knows about the problems\nat the MTV Music Awards - bitch fight. When Brandy\ncame over to publicise her new album Never Say\nNever, she was quoted as saying there wasn't any\nproblem -1 was told her mouth was saying no problem,\nbut her body language was screaming bitch. In terms\nof sales Brandy is ahead, her album is better; except for\nthe cover of Bryan Adam's Everything I Do - why the hell\nis that there. Monica's album is good, her vocals are\ntight, but she just doesn't have the cross over potential of Brandy - the only way to settle it is to get Don King\nin and fight it out, you know you want to see that.\nAnother load of girl bands appeared from the darkness over the summer and the pick of the bunch is I lon-ey z.I say this based on their debut single Finally Found,\nbut I haven't heard anything else so if they go shit don't blame me. The three young ladies in the group come\nfrom all over Europe, Celenafrom London, Naimafrom\nFrance and I leaven lii from Germany - may do well in\nthe Eurovision Song Contest then.\nThe summer also saw the release of Snoop's new\nalbum Da Came Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told, it shifted\nfast and went straight to number one in the States,\nbecoming the second biggest debut of the year after\nthe Beastie Boys' recent album Hello Nasty. I'm still waiting to see what happens to Snoop when Suge Knight\n(CEO of Death Row Records) gets out jail, remember\nSuge got Dr Dre out of his contract using a baseball bat,\nand you now Snoop's head is around.\nTalking about albums, the final album ever from A Tribe Called Quest was released in the summer, titled\nThe Love Moment. It ain't the greatest stuff they've\ndone, but its not bad, it's packed with chilled out\ngrooves. The first single to be lifted from it is Find A Way.\nThe members of the Tribe say they're all going to start\nout on solo projects with Qt lp already getting into the\nstudio.\nSingle of the week is the dope / low Deep Is Your\nLove from Dru Il ill, these talented boys have come up\nwith an absolute killer, this is a must. Dru Il ill will be\ndrop pin' their second set Enter Fhe Dru by the end of\nOctober. After a whole summer of hearing it. Top oFThe\nWorld by Brandy & featuring Mase, is at last getting a British release. This is the best piece of street soul out\nthere at the minute (watch out for the remix with Big\nPun on rap). R. Kelly has returned with, guess what? a love song, but nevertheless Half On A Babuls very classy\nand definitely worth checking out. The latest single from\nQueen Pen is out, but stay well away from it. It's Frue\nis a cover of the Spandau Ballet hit True, and quite simply it's a disaster. Remember Ashley from the Fresh\nPrince of Bel-Air (real name Tatyana Ali), well she's turned her hand to singing now and brings us Daydreaming it's solid enough, nothing spectacular, but\nsomehow I always find myself singing along. J. D.'s new single is Sweetheart with Mariah Carey on vocals\nas guest, fortunately it's mostly Mariah already causing\nhuge damage on the dance floors.\nSee ya round. E] Milen\nPhat Selection\nHorse & Carriage - Cam'ron & Mase\nThis tune is getting heavy rotation on radio, head nodding delight.\nThe Mlseducatlon OfLauryn Hill (LP) - Lauryn Hill\nThe front-woman for the fugees has stormed the world with her first solo\neffort - written, produced and arranged by her!\nHow Deep Is Your Love - Dru Hill feat. Redman\nTaken from the Rush Hour soundtrack this is a must have.\nThey Don't Know' - Jon B Simply stunning, faultless vocals.\nTwo Way Street'- Miss Jones feat Big Pun\nHOT, out on promo only, this is burning up.\nTop Of The World- Brandy feat. Mase\nFine street soul with Mase on rap\nProdigal Slsta (LP) - Beverly Knight\nBev really is kick in' it, includes Made it Back and Rewind, this really does live\nup to the hype.\n\n"

    "content": "s FOCUS\n12 October 1998\nAn Introduction to the Haldane Collection\nfrom Janet Smith, Haldane Librarian\nNew members of College will be pleasantly surprised to find that Imperial offers\na Humanities and recreational library.\nThis brief introduction - which I hope will\nserve as a reminder to existing students\ntoo - is to encourage you to make the\nmost of the opportunities it offers you.\nThe Haldane is easy to locate - its comfortable reading area is visible from the\nQueen's Lawn - and admission and\nopening hours are the same as for the\nCentral Library as a whole. Its extensive\nstock of 40,000 books and 7,000 sound\nrecordings provides for leisure and extracurricular reading, as well as supporting\nthe teaching and cultural activities of the\nHumanities Programme. Almost everything other than reference works may be\nborrowed. There is a charge of 50p per\nCD issue, which compares very\nfavourably with most public libraries!\nWhat do you want?\nIn a survey of library users conducted last\nyear, the majority who commented on\nthe I lal dane said that they would like to\nsee more fiction and more popular CDs.\nWell, the good news is that you can have\nthem! These areas are the responsibility of ICU, which provides the budgets for\nthem. Student buyers are usually elected\nat the beginning of the academic year,\nbut your suggestions for purchases are\nvery welcome. The best way to make\nthem known is to complete a recommendation form, which can either be\npicked up in paper format in the library\nor which you can send electronically via\nthe library homepage\n(http://www.lib.ic.ac.uk). The I lal dane staff will then forward them to the student buyer. The quality of these collections depends on you!\nWhat can the Haldane offer?\nBesides the extensive collection of classic and current fiction, the I lal dane book\nstock offers a wide choice of recreational\nand cultural reading. I here is other English and foreign literature, history, politics,\nphilosophy, art, biography, cookery,\nhumour, popular medicine, music books,\nsport and a good travel section. There\nis much more that cannot be so easily\ncategorised. The reference section\nincludes encyclopedias on individual\nHumanities subjects, quotation collections and English usage guides, for exam-ple. Your suggestions for additions to the\nlibrary are welcome.\nNewspapers and periodicals\nThe I lal dane subscribes to approximately\n60 periodicals of general interest. These\ninclude such titles as Amateur Photographer, Autocar, Country Life, Film\nReview, Great Outdoors, London Review\nof Books, Private Eye, Radio Fimes, Time\nand Time Out. Some are taken in the\ninterest of students on language courses\n- L 'Express, IIMondo and Sfemfor exam-ple. Others are taken in support of other\nHumanities Programme courses - Contemporary British Flistory and Written\nCommunication, to name just two. Daily\nnewspapers [Daily Telegraph, Financial\nTimes, Guardian, Independent, Times)\nare kept for one week. Library staff will\nbe glad to advise on other means of\nconsulting issues not held in paper form\n- through the internet or on CD-ROM.\nThis of course goes for many newspapers\n(including overseas papers) and periodicals not held by the library, which may\nbe consulted electronically from IC or in\nhard copy in other libraries.\nClassical music for listeners\nA very wide range of \"classical\" music is\nheld on CD and to a lesser extent on cas-set te. There is a broad spectrum of composers (Binchois, Biber, Bach, Beethoven,\nBrahms, Berg, Boulez ...) as well as\nrecitals, including the Three Tenors.\nFor those who read music and like to\nfollow the score, a good selection of\nminiature scores of instrumental music\nand vocal scores of opera and choral\nworks is also held.\nClassical music for instrumentalists and singers\nIn addition to the scores mentioned\nabove, singers will find a selection of solo\nvocal music For instrumentalists there is\na good selection of solo music and\nchamber music parts.\nMaps\nThe Ordnance Survey 1:50 000 series and\na selection of British and overseas city\nmaps may be borrowed. Aliases are for\nreference in the library.\nLanguage courses\n\"there is a good selection of language\nbooks and courses on cassette.\nHumanities Programme\ncourse material\nMost books for I lu mani ties Programme\nundergraduate courses are to be found\nin the I lal dane. Courses for 1997/98\ninclude Art and Nature, Modern Literature and Drama, Music and Ideas in the\n19th Century, Philosophy, Politics, and\nEuropean History 1870-1989 - in the last\ncase besides books there are related\nvideos and CD-ROMs. In the case of\ncourses in history, philosophy and public understanding of science, including\nMSc courses, the I lal dane provides general materials relating to the courses,\nwhile specialised scientific and sociological material is held in the Science and\nTechnology Studies and Management\nCollections respectively.\nAudiovisual collection\nThe Audiovisual collection is not a recreational collection but consists predominantly of videos on curricular subjects,\nwhich you may find usefully supplement\nsome of your courses. Subjects covered\nin this small but growing collection\ninclude Computing, Engineering, Environmental and Life Sciences, History\n(20th century), and Physics. Some videos\nmay be borrowed on restricted loan;\nothers may be viewed in the Audiovisual\nroom in the I lal dane Collection. Also\navailable in the Audiovisual room is the\nPatent Office Training Package, an interactive video laser disc, on the purpose of\npatents and how to apply for them.\nEvents\nThe I lal dane not only provides the mate-rials, but gives you the chance to hear and\nmeet the authors and other speakers on\ntopical matters. Past talks or readings\nhave been given by Alan Sillitoe, Roderick Swanston and Michael Foot, among\nmany others.

    "content": "12 October 1998 7\nLet us forget!\nDo you remember where you were\nwhen Diana died? Do you remember\nwhere you were on the anniversary, just\nover a month ago? No? The complete\nlack of enthusiasm for the anniversary,\nnot least here in fond on, suggests that\nDiana fatigue has set in. It comes not a moment too soon - in the last year poker\ngames across the country have been\nruined by every pack missing a card,\nwhile vast stretches of Holland are now\nbare, harvested to replenish Britain's florists.\nSo why mention the 'D' word?\nBecause, my friends, we work and in\nmany cases live next door to Kensington\nGardens. In these gardens, near the\npalace, certain powers that be want to\nbuild a Diana Memorial Garden. It will\nhave fountains. It will have statues. It will\nhave huge blocks of public conveniences, children's' areas, cafes, souvenir shops... you see where I'm going.\nIt has been hoped (or feared) that the\nproposed gardens will attract thousands,\neven millions, of tourists (sorry, respectful mourners) every year. Almost all\nKensington residents are opposed to it.\nAll of the traders on Kensington High\nStreet are opposed to it. It will increase\ncongestion (and thus pollution), push\nup prices in an already expensive area,\nand generally lead to SW7 becoming\nmore of a tourist trap than it already is.\nYou know the Sandwich Shop on\nGloucester Road? Do you really think\nthey'll still do those half-price sandwiches\nwhen there's fifty tourists on the street\nthinking a hot dog for \u00a33 is pretty good\nvalue?\nOkay, so I don't like the entire 'Diana\nQueen of Hearts' thing. As far as I'm concerned, most of the media-fuelled\nhype has been tasteless and insulting to\nher memory, family, and most importantly, her sons. That's just my opinion.\nThe proposed Memorial Garden, how-ever, will affect all of us at IC. Maybe it's time we joined Kensington residents to\nfight a common cause? fetters, please,\nand no flowers.\nAdding Flora to IC\nWhile we are on the subject of flowers\n(watch this link...), I want to get the college gardening plans out in the open.\nNow I like flowers and, quite frankly, we\ncould do with more colour around the\nSouth Ken campus. Putting a flowerbed\nin the place of lucrative (as in \u00a360,000 per\nannum) car parking spaces seems less\nthan shrewd, but it appears to be happening outside the library. I 've heard of\nProfessors who can no longer park their\ncars on campus. Surely re-developing the\nflowerbeds around the Queen's fawn,\nand maybe extending them down more\nthan two sides, would be a less costly\nalternative?\nWhich brings me to the BMS Building. The plants (flowers, trees, golden\nboughs - I'm not sure) that are going in\nfront of the main entrance are (apparently) going to cost over \u00a325,000. That's25 students' tuition fees. On plants.\nFinally, the reason for all those qualifying adverbs is that no-one seems to\nwant to confirm the details. Felix will find\nout, if we get any news staff. Still, give\nme a call and I 'll put daffodils in for you\n- I 'll do it for a mere \u00a310,000.\nWill you stand?\nI am referring, of course, to the various\nnomination papers that went up today.\nSeveral council positions are available\n(not least RAG chair), and it would be\nnice if they could all be filled this time\nround. It seems to me that quite a few\nstudents are initially interested in standing for these positions, but mysteriously\nnever seem to make it to the Union\narmed with a pen.\nOf course, the major position is\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies). I barely set foot in the Union Office during Freshers' Week, preferring the quiet\nsurrounds of the Felix Office, but I can\nguarantee Messrs Il ellard and Ince, along\nwith the permanent Union staff, have\nhad a pretty tough time without a DP(C&S). But if altruism isn't going to be\na good enough motive for you, think of\nall those CV points, the experience you'll\ngain and the contacts you'll make. Oh,\nand if you do forget that pen on your way\nto the Union, drop by the Felix Office and\nI 'll lend you one.\nHello, Freshers?\nOnce again it is 6am on a cold and damp\nmorning, I'm tired and I smell. The reason this time is that I took a couple of\nhours off last night (Wednesday) to have\na few pints in the Union. A very quiet\nfew pints, as it turned out. Where are\nyou all? I went around on Monday\nevening looking for people passed out\non the stairs and sexual exploits in public places (both reasonably common in\nmy Freshers' Week, though not involving\nme), and found none. Are you working?\nThat in itself doesn't bother me.\nWhat does, however, is the tendency\nfor University to be seen as 'another\nrung in the ladder' (insert your favourite\nclich e as appropriate). It isn't just another\nqualification, it isn'ta passport with which\nto start your life. It is life. Live it.\nYours patronising ly, Ed\nTHE SUICIDE HANDBOOK.
