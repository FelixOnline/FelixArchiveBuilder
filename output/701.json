    "content": "FELIXD\nWritten, formal examinations\nhave a hallowed place in\nacademic life, and while, from\ntime to time, education a lists have espoused alternative\nmethods, they are widely\naccepted as the fairest and\nmost efficient means of\nassessing students' knowledge and understanding.\nThe written examination is not\nhowever by any means a precise\ninstrument. It is certainly\npossible, for example, on\nindividual papers, to come up\nwith a 'fluke' result, that is a result markedly better than the\nstudent's actual ability would\nhave led one to expect. It is also\nunquestionably possible to come\nup with results that are worse\nthan either the student or his\nteachers anticipated, and which\ndo not fairly reflect the student's ability.\nThe risk of systematically\nunder performing in a set of\nexaminations is linked to two\nseparate, but closely related,\nfactors: (a) an inadequate\ntechnique for playing the\nexamination game, and (b) an\ninadequate recognition that a formal examination, like any\nother testing situation, can\ngenerate levels of anxiety which\nin themselves may have an\nadverse effect on intellectual\nfunctioning.\nPlaying the examination\ngame\nExaminations are to some\nextent an abstraction from\nreality, an artificial construct.\nThey are a sort of game in which\nthe participants are invited to\ndemonstrate what they know, in\nwriting, on a blank piece of\npaper, in a set time. An\nimportant component of the\ngame is that the examiner is\nforbidden to give credit on any\nother evidence than that\npresented in the script. It is\nastonishing fact that despite this\nelementary point, some students\ninsist on abandoning common\nsense to the extent, apparently\nof playing another game\naltogether. A common\nmanifestation of this is the\nstudent who spends an hour and\nthree quarters (out of three\nhours) writing, re-writing,\npolishing and perfecting one\nanswer or five required.\nAnother common departure\nfrom the rules consist in writing\nout the answers without properly\nreading the questions. There are\ntwo, equally devastating variants\nto this: (a) not 'selecting the\nquestions which opt i mise the\ncandidate's chances of scoring\nhigh over-all, and (b) misreading\nindividual questions and\nsubsequently writing an answer\nto a question which in effect is\nnot there.\nSome basic and well\nrecognised components of a good examination technique are\nas follows:\n1. Read the question paper\ncarefully, preferably twice.\nErrors of perception are highly\ncorrelated with heightened\nanxiety.\n2. Select the questions you are\ngoing to answer, put them in\norder, and write out a simple\ntimetable, allowing the same time\nto all questions (assuming the\nsame maximum marks for each).\nfocussed on something else.\n4. Answer the easiest question\nfirst, so that you can proceed to\nthe others on a psychological\n'high'.\n5. Don't be afraid to make\nrough notes in your answer\nbook. When you are answering\none question, ideas relating to\nother questions you are going to\nanswer may come into your\nhead\u2014jot them down. Similarly\non entering the examination\nroom, and possibly before\nreading the paper at all, you may\nwish to write down very quickly\nsalient points which you have\nmemorised in your final\npreparation.\nIt is, of course, essential to rule\nout rough work very clearly, so\nthat the examiner knows that it\nExams, anxiety\nby\nDon\nAdlington\nand\ncommon\nsense\nAllow fifteen minutes for the\nplanning and five minutes at the\nend for finishing off. Some people\nfind that it helps to make quick\nnotes on each question at this\nstage.\n3. Be disciplined in adhering to\nthe timetable. Recognise that the\nfirst few marks accruing to a question can be obtained far\nmore easily than the last\nfew\u2014and it is the total mark\nwhich counts. If you get stuck in\nthe middle of a question leave it\nand deal with the next one. You\ncan always return to the\nunfinished answer later, and\nindeed the very act of\ndisengaging from the difficulty\nmay allow a resolution to surface\nwhile you mind is actually\ndoes not form part of your\nanswer.\n6. If you run out of time, tell the\nexaminer so, and say which point\nyou would have gone on to\ndiscuss if you had more time.\nDealing with anxiety\nA degree of anxiety,\naccompanied by recognised\nphysiological symptoms, is a normal reaction to testing and\nstressful situations. Everyone is\naffected to some extent and\nshould be aware of it. You tell\nyourself that you are anxious,\nthat it is natural, and that you can\nhandle it. In doing that, you\nminimise the risk that the anxiety\nmay escalate to a point where it\nbecomes disabling. Again there\nseems to be some common\nsense ways of handling this\nproblem.\nArrive early\u2014far better to be\nbiting your nails outside the\nexamination room, than sitting in\na traffic jam at Earl's Court.\nOnce you are in the examination\nroom, sit down and relax a minute or two before doing\nanything.\nTo a certain extent anxiety is\ncontagious. If you feel that this is\na hazard for you, then 'keep\nyourself to yourself before\nadmission to the examination\nroom. It may also be worthwhile\nresisting the impulse to compare\nnotes with all your friends\nimmediately after an exam.\nIt is also a good idea in the\nexamination itself, not to let\nyourself be thrown if your\nneighbours appear to be writing\nwith more facility than you are.\nFhey may, for all you know, be\nwriting rubbish, and in any case,\ninordinately long answers do not\nnecessarily bring the best\nresults.\nThe most common symptom\nof anxiety getting out of hand, is\nan overwhelming sense of panic,\na temporary breakdown of our\nrational and ordered response to\na demanding situation. In an\nexamination this may, for\nexample, take the form of\n'blanking out'\u2014completely\nforgetting everything. The\nremedy for this is to switch off,\nclose your eyes, and do nothing\nfor a while.\nThis is far better than yielding\ntoo easily to the powerful\nimpulse to resolve the tension by\ngiving up altogether. When you\nfeel that the anxiety attack has\nabated, try getting your mind\nworking again by using a 'scribble technique'. Just write\ndown words\u2014any words\u2014\nwhich lead to other words, until\nyou feel that your faculty of recall\nis available to you again.\nA final point. If you have a history of becoming particularly\nanxious at exam times, or if for\ncontingent reasons you think\nthat you may do so this time, it\nwould be sensible to talk to\nsomeone about it well\nbeforehand. Tell your personal\ntutor or your ser li or tutor, talk to\na doctor or nurse at the Health\nCentre, or come to see me. Just\na small amount of practical help\nmay make a substantial\ndifference in the event.\nSome material in this article is\nderived from a lecture given by\nDr Robert Sharp of the Institute\nof Behavioural Therapy.\nFEUX Friday 26 April 1985 11\n\n"

    "content": "LOOTERS\nOUR Stolen\nPot\nDear Sir,\nOn the evening of Tuesday the 12/3/85,\nthe night of the election result celebrations,\nthe theft of a Union Pot occurred, in the\nUnion Bar at 9.30pm. The Pot, RCS UNo12, the Motor Club Chairman's Pot, is valued at\nabout \u00a3120. It has an RCS crest, a line\ndrawing of Jezebel as well as 30 years of\nnames engraved upon it. It looks slightly\ndented and mishap en and has the unusual\nfeature that it has no lip at the rim.\nExtensive inquires have been made, the bar\nand Union building have been searched\nextensively but to no avail. It has therefore\nbeen decided to offer a substantial reward for\nthe return of the pot, unless the re turner was\nfound to have stolen it. Any information\nshould be given to either myself, 471C Mech\nEng Dept, int 6289, or Pascal Carr, Physics 2,\nor to Dave Parry, IC Union. Pascal Carr, the\ncurrent holder of the post has said that he\nwould give anything for the return of the pot.\nYours,\nGareth Fish\n'Down\nwith\nIsrael'\nDear Sir,\nI was reading your last issue of FELIX(20 March) on my trip back from IC from an\ninterview when I came across two letters\ndirectly insulting to the intelligence of the\nordinary man!\nBoth had criticised the large slogan 'Down\nwith Israel' sprayed in red on College walls as\nchildish and crude. Although I am no\nsupporter of vile tactics myself, I believe that\nsometimes the most genuine and deeply felt\npains find no other way of expression. What\nelse can one do when even the UN resolution\ncondemning the occupation of Israeli forces\nin Lebanon is vetoed? If Jewish Soc sincerely\nseeks some other means of communication,\nlet them watch the news on TV concerning\nIsrael's daily crimes in South Lebanon. More\n. over they should not be offended by the 'red'\ncolour letters of the slogan, since their\nbrothers in the Israeli army don't mind\nshedding the red blood of defenseless\ncivilians every day. In fact everything in that\nslogan is a reminder for those who reflect.\nI hope that the Jews all over the world\nwould return to the true teachings of Moses\nrather than cling blindly to the state of Israel,\nafter all the shameless and unique atrocities\nshe has committed in Lebanon.\nA prospective IC student\nT Mohammad\nTHE\nKWALITY\nTAND00RI RESTAURANT\nThe home of authentic Indian cooking\nFully Licensed \u2014 Newly opened\nNearest Tube, South Kensington\nOpen Mon-Sun 12 noon to 3 p.m.,6 p.m. to 12 midnight. Incl. Bank Holidays\n38 THURLOE PLACE, LONDON, SW7\nTel. 589 3663\nFELIX\nThe Jarratt report must be the cause of a few\nsmug faces in Sherfield (see news pages).\nMany of its recommendations have already\nbeen put into operation at Imperial,\nparticularly the establishment of a 'rolling\nacademic and institutional plan'.\nBut there are still important lessons to be\nlearnt from Jarratt. Among the 'performance\nindicators' that universities should look at\nare teaching quality and success rate of higher degrees. The UGC weren't very\ncomplimentary about either, when they\nvisited College recently. But more important\nthan a low indication of performance is a falling one. And there is no doubt that in\nsome subjects, IC's market share of\nundergraduates applications is falling. The\nchief reason for this is not difficult to see. As\nlong as Imperial fails to provide sufficient onsite accommodation it will fail to attract the\nbest quality students. Thus begins the vicious\ncircle of decline.\nThe Jarratt report should be compulsory\nreading for all Union Officers. Student\nUnions must be among the most inefficiently\nrun bodies. At IC, anyway, there is no 'rolling\nplan', indeed no forward or strategic\nplanning at all. This can partly be explained\nby the fact that the officers change every year.\nBut this increases the importance of forward\nplanning. Any sabbatical will tell you that it\nis difficult to achieve anything of great\nconsequence in the Union in the space of one\nyear. How much more could be achieved if a succession,, of Presidents had even the\nopportunity to work towards a long-term\nobjective. As it stands at the moment,\nthough, the President of one year rarely\nfollows through the initiatives of the previous\nyear. Perhaps the establishment of a small\ncommittee to monitor and record long-term\nplans would be a step in the right direction.\nFinally, FELIX wishes good luck to the\nUniversity Challenge team next Tuesday,\nwhen they compete against Jesus, Oxford in\nthe final.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Richard,\nGrenville, Hugh, Martin, Jon, Debbie,\nMichael, Tinker, Don Adlington, Pete, John,\nRosemary, Tony and all the colla tors.

Auditions for the three\nplays will take place on Friday 26 April at\n7.30pm in the Union Dining Hall (1st floor,\nUnion Building). If you have ever thought of\nacting, the details of the Tour are detailed\nbelow.\nThe three plays are Funeral Games a black comedy by Joe Orton (four male, one\nfemale), Unify by Jane Anning (two female,\none male) and You're A Good Man Charlie\nBrown (three males, two females). Anyone is\nwelcome to audition.\nRehearsals for the plays begin in the\nmiddle of June after the exams have finished.\nThey take place during the evenings,\nenabling people to take full time jobs. All\nmembers of the casts are required in London\nfor these rehearsals. The festival begins, with\nthe theatre venue being converted from\nSaturday 3 August, at which point the\nrehearsals cease and equipment is taken to\nEdinburgh. The first performances begin on\nThursday 8 Auguest, with press previews\nand continue during the subsequent three\nweeks. The plays by Orton and Anning are\nperformed on alternate nights from August 8\nto August 24. You're A Good Man... is\nperformed each lunchtime from August 25 to\nAugust 31, when the festival finishes.\nAccommodation in Edinburgh is usually in\nflats, with rent being about \u00a330 per week.\nOther costs are transport to Edinburgh and\nobviously food and drink. So if you have no\nother plans for the Summer and are\ninterested in acting, come along to the\nauditions. If you have any questions or\ndoubts either drop me a note (Nick\nShackley, Chem Eng 3) or come along on\nFriday. For anyone interested in acting, this\nis an opportunity not to be missed.\nA scene from one of last year's successful\nproductions\nQTSOC\nSilly Season\nDue to pressure of work, the weakness of the\nDollar and the fall of Stoke City, QT will be\nhaving a moderately quiet term. Summer\nhowever is the silly season and events will be\narranged in the open air, usually in Hyde\nPark. These will include raving at Speakers\nCorner and Donald's walk about by the\nRound pond. Any other ideas aimed at\nannoying tourists will be gratefully received.\nMeetings will be held as usual on\nTuesdays, 1pm, Southside Upper Lounge\nfor the next few weeks.\nPS Sorry no jokes this week.\nPPS If anybody knows where the pil locks from PPSoc are, then we are still waiting for\nour pillow fight.\nICCND\nAGM\nICCND has no events organised for this\nterm except the Annual General Meeting\nwhere members can receive their late\nmembership cards and stand for various\ncommittee posts.

Due I am sure, to a small\nnumber of people who 'borrow' books from\nthe Bookshop we have had to install a complete closed circuit television system in\nthe shop.

    "content": "IN THIS\nALIEN ENVIRONMENT,\nSPACE TECHNOLOGY\nIS OUT OF ITS DEPTH\nInspecting underground gas pipelines for faults may not sound like the\nultimate high-tech challenge. But, in\nfact, the task proved to be beyond the\n'state-of-the-art' technologies previously\navailable \u2014 even in military and aerospace applications.\nPROBLEM:\nDesign a vehicle which can travel\ninside the pipe, carrying equipment\ncapable of identifying any significant\ndefect, and pinpointing its position to\nwithin a metre in a run of up to a hundred\nkilometres or more.\nSOLUTION:\nTHE INTELLIGENT PIG\nThe Intelligent Pig, developed by\nthe gas people, is a vehicle carrying\nhighly advanced sensing, data processing and recording equipment. Driven\nthrough the pipe by the gas pressure\nwithin it, the Pig can be used without\ntaking the pipe out of service.\nWhat is more, it can not only pinpoint any defect on the inside or outside\nof a steel pipe, but even describe its nature.\nHOW?\nUsing strong magnetic fields or\nelastic waves propagated at ultrasonic\nfrequencies, different types of sensors\ncan detect corrosion, cracks, impact\ndamage or distortion of the pipe. But\nthe real challenge lay in processing the\nhundreds of millions of signals produced\nby the sensors in an average run.\nTHERE WASN'TA COMPUTER\nSMALL ENOUGH AND TOUGH\nENOUGH\nMany of the pipes to be inspected\nare less than 305mm in diameter. To fit\nsufficiently powerful data processing\nequipment into the tiny space available,\nhybrid micro circuits incorporating\ncustom-designed silicon chips had to be\ndeveloped. And since the space restrictions also limit battery size and therefore\npower, many of these highly advanced\nelectronic components have to operate\nat the very limits of their specifications.\nWhat's more.the environment inside\nthe pipe isn't exactly friendly. All the\nhighly sophisticated equipment carried\nby the Pig has had to be designed to\ntolerate or be protected from extreme\nvibration, mechanical shock, dirt, and\ngas pressure of up to 70 atmospheres.\nA 'TOMORROW'S WORLD'TAPE\nRECORDER\nThe sheer volume of data to be stored\ninspired the development of what is\nprobably the most advanced ultra-mini at uri sed tape recorder currently in\nexistence. Making extensive use of sub-miniature hybrid microelectronics, new\ntypes of recording heads and ultra-precision mechanical engineering, this\nlittle marvel can store up to 500 million\nreadings on a single reel of standard\none-inch tape,with an accuracy of better\nthan one-thousandth of one percent!\nFROM REEL TO REELS\nOnce the Pig has finished its run, the\nnext job is to prepare the data for analysis by powerful, advanced computers\nsuch as the VAX 1 l/780. There's so much\ninformation in the Pig's tiny recorder\nthat many reels ol computer tape are\nneeded to receive it,and many hours of\ncomputer time to analyse it.\nTHE RESULT\nBritain's underground gas transmission network is a multi-billion pound\nasset. And the technical pyrotechnics\nwe've just described have a thoroughly\ndown-to-earth end result-they help the\ngas people to maintain this asset more\nefficiently and cost effectively.\nWHY THE GAS PEOPLE LIVE IN\nTHE FUTURE\nThe fact that gas is Britain's most\npopular domestic fuel-and a powerful\nand growing force in industry, too-is the\nresult of many years'foresight, planning\nand massive investment by British Gas\nscientists and engineers. And they're still\nworking for the future-to meet Britain's energy needs in the next century.\nTHE GAS PEOPLEWORKING FORTOMORROW'S WORLD TODAY\n\n"

With titles like The Flowers of Spring it's hardly\nsurprising. Now, it seems, they have brushed off their\nmemorable\u2014but historical\u2014psychedelic jazz image, shaken\nthe last few hippies from their coat tails and waxed\nsaxo phonic al. The band is headed as ever by the incredibly\nversatile John McLaughlin, trading acoustic guitar for clarinet\nand synthesised guitar, and Billy Cobham, reputed by some, to\nbe the worlds greatest (although perhaps not the fastest)\ndrummer. But, for sheer heat and rhythm, saxophonist Bill\nEvans, already an established mainstream jazz musician, has\nlaid down a remarkable selection of up-beat and ballad riffs for\nthe set, each one dripping in vitality.\nNo, that's not entirely true, old habits die hard, and some\ntracks {The Unbeliever sounding suspiciously like some like\nsome live-music Miles Davis wrote some ten years ago, and\nWhen Blue Turns to Gold still retains their subdued nature; but\nnone of the eight tracks meander. They are well structured,\ncompact, tight as a drum.\nThe new Mahavishnu is hardly a British venture. In addition to\nCobham and Evans, McLaughlin uses two lesser known\nScandinavian musicians for keyboard and bass work. Everything I said about Scandinavia being the home of jazz diehards and hippies I take back a hundred fold, oh, I don't know\nthough. They've got to live somewhere. Maybe that's how this\nnew Mahavishnu thing all started....\nSINGLES m^4$t Pm Howard Jones: Look Mama\nDespite repeated claims by\nhis army of fans that Howard\nJones's songwriting talents\nare many and varied, I have to\nadmit to being bored to tears\nwith the tedious What is love\nsound that permeates virtually\nevery track on the Dream Into\nAction album. It was great the\nfirst time, even ok on the\nsecond, but unfortunately\nLook Mama has little to\nrecommend it for repeated\nlistening.\nFree ez: That Beats My\nPatience\nFreeez MK 111 seem to have\nreformed in name only: the\nstyle and depth of this new\nsingle fortunately has none of\nthe electro 'bob pop' of A E lOU and Pop Goes Your Love but\ninstead a light funky feel and\nan attractively soft lead vocal.\nA bit bland admittedly, but\ngood dance music for us non-soul freaks.\nI Start Counting: Still Smiling\nThe second release from\nMute's new Depeche Mode\nsound alikes, this does show a remarkable (and surprising)\noriginality. It's almost Yazooish in interpretation,\nand with excellent mix down\nby Femi J.I like it!\nWooden Tops: Move Me\nBefore you move on to a review of a known band, do\ngive this a chance.I think\nWoodentops could be the new\nAztec Camera of 1 9 8 5 .\nAlready supporting bands like\nEverything but The Girl and\nOrange Juice, this is their\nsecond single, and the first on\nRough Trade. It probably\nwon't be successful yet, but\njust watch this band...\nIt's that time of year. When a young man's fancy turns to\nlove and he does more with\nhis nights than argue about\nwho's got all the duvet. Search\nout the sunglasses from\nbehind the dusty Christmas\ndecorations. The old, sticky\nbottle of Pimm's from the back\nof the larder. Ice in the fridge\ninstead of coins in the meter.\nAnd^the living will be easy...\nOnce these last few weeks\nof academic angst have gone,\nwhat then? Cleaner in\nSouthside? Oh, be serious.\nIndustrial training? Writing\nprograms (sic) for a fifth-generation teas maid. Not\nagain. What you need is a holiday. And because we at\nFELIX like to be of service, we\nwill show you some books to\nsend you on your way and a few to read when you get\nthere.\nYes, I wish they all could be\nCaledonian girls. I would\ngladly Fly the Flag, and let\nthem give me a flight so good I won't want to get off. The only\nsnag is that I'm skin t. My\nAmerican Express card has\nmelted, and the Service Till\nprints 'Fuck Off You Little\nCreep' every time I put my\nnumbers in. 'C 'est la vie' as\nthey say in France. 'Versprung\nDurch Technic' as they say at\nNat West. The only way for us\npaupers is via the Hitchhiker's guide to Europe by\nKen Welsh, now in its tenth\nedition. If you already have\nthe old model, it isn't worth\ngetting, because the more\nobvious alterations \u2014 the exchange rates\u2014are well up\nthe creek by now. Otherwise\nthis book is a must, even if\nyour Mum won't let you hang\naround with lorry-drivers.\nEssentially, it tells you how to\nexport the student life-style,\nbut don't let that put you off.\nOver the years, Ken Welsh has\nbuilt up a fascinating collection of scams, dodges\nand downright skulduggery\nwhich will help you get by on\nvery little besides your own\nnerve. For the faint-hearted,\nthere are also lists of place to\neat, sleep and act like a tourist. If you are going by car, you\nmay have been tempted by\nArthur E peron' s books \u2014Traveller's France, Traveller's Italy, and so forth. My\nadvice is 'don't bother'. Their\npremise is obvious: stay off\nthe Motorways. Beyond that,\nthe books list a few routes\nthrought the relevant country,\nwith recommended restaurants and hotels along the way.\nOf less use, but very freaky\nis No Need to Die by Eddie\nMcGee. If you are hassled by\nthe Pigs in Amsterdam, The\nHitch-Hiker's Guide to Europe\nwill suffice. If you are hassled\nby the Pygmies in the Andes,\nyou need McGee's book. That\nand as e rvi cable shotgun. The\ndrawbacks are irritating \u2014 poor diagrams, semi literate commentary, much\ntoo big and heavy for a practical survival guide. The\nideas, though, are fantastic.\nAn insight into a completely\ndifferent way of life, living off\nthe land. Tracking animals.\nTracking people. Odd stuff,\nbut strangely compelling. Any\nman who has trapped snakes\nfor food deserves the royalties\nfrom his books, and I certainly\nwouldn't want him turning up\nat our office to complain\nabout a nasty review. There\nare no rec i pies for quiche in\nthis book.\nSo what do you take to read\nfor the boring bits\u2014night flights and so on? Well, I will\ntry to read Joyce's Ulysses for\nthe third summer in a row. Bet\nI fall asleep by page 50. For\ninsomniacs, the choice usually includes at least one\nor two 'thrillers'\u2014the thrills\nusually deflated by the six-inch nails which hold the plot\ntogether. However, there is a sub-genre which is reliably\nbetter than the average; the\njournalistic spy story. Why it is\nso popular is a bit of a mystery\nin itself. I suspect that the best\nexamples succeed by providing a plausible framework for headline events\nwhich may be difficult to\nunderstand in isolation. Spymasters playing huge games\nof logic have the same,\nsimplifying appeal as mathematics, Santa Claus, or\nextremist politics. It often\nseem that people find plurality\ndiscomforting; the friendly,\nauthoritative voice of a journalist or politician spinning a yearn without\nloose ends can seem more\nreal than reality itself. It is\noften amusing to read passages on an author's political enemies. In the\ncontext of fiction, a more\nevenhanded approach applies than that found in\ndirectly disc our sive pieces. If\nfaced with an airport books tall, have a look at the\nnon sence churned-out by\nHurd and Osmond, or perhaps\nGerald Seymour (who wrote\nHarry's Game).\nFELIX Friday 26 April 1985 13\n\n"

    "content": "[NEWS FEATURE\nfake a Walk Dowq\nAnother museum bites the dust as this week FELIX takes a walk down\nExhibition Road to investigate the Victoria and Albert Museum. In\nparticular we look at the Boilerhouse Project, a good idea which seems to\nhave become temporarily submerged in sociology. All you budding\nindustrial designers out there don't miss this one.\nEXHIBITION\nROAD SW7\nCITY OF WESTMINSTER\nNATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS IN\nDESIGN\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum\nexudes conventionality from\nevery pore. Looking at it, with the\nhigh roof, marble steps and a little\nsign telling you where the gift\nshop is is enough to turn the\nstomach of many. If you go\ninside, and pass the gift shop, a short wander will take you to\nPrimary Victorian Gallery\nNumber One, which appears to be\nfull of bits of stone and pieces of\ncloth. So does Primary Victorian\nGallery Number Two, and a few\nminutes is enough to convince\nyou that the V&A is a place for\nstoring bits of stone and pieces of\ncloth, which in fact it is. Ignore\nthe fact that most of the stuff here\nhas been chiselled off the walls of\ncapital cities on the other side of\nthe world against the occupant's wishes. Here we are, right in the\nmiddle of Britain's Cultural\nHeritage, and it all seems so, well,\nhistorical. Is there nothing in this\ngreat temple of fine art to interest\nthe sort of hip student we all like\nto think we are?\nWell, the answer is 'Yes'. There\nis the Boilerhouse Project, which\nis aiming to show how industrial\ndesign can be examined and\nstudied in a similar way to the rest\nof the objects in the V&A. It is linked with Habitat, the\nHigh Street temple of smooth\ndesign which has young trendies\nall over the UK filling their flats\nwith pine and plastic. As you\nwould expect the Boilerhouse\nitself is a rather small hot room,\nand it is heralded by a nice neon\nsign outside. This sign is neatly\nhidden round a corner in a corr i door, so as not to upset the\nvarious stone gods and goddesses\nin the next gallery along. The\nBoilerhouse changes it's displays\nquite regularly, and in the short\ntime since it opened has achieved\nsome startling success.\nThe current exhibition is\nNational Characteristics in Design\nTypically American Space Shuttle...\nYou can learn so much about the USA by just looking at it can't you.. and it attempts to show how\nindustrial design, particularly of\nmass market consumer goods,\nshows national characteristics\nwhich reflect and are reflected by\ndeep rooted traits in a particular\nnation's collective con sio us ness. Unfortunately this interpretation ends up looking like pure\ntwaddle. This may seem a sweeping generalisation but if you\nthink that's bad then just listen to\nthese two gems, taken more or\nless at random from the catalogue\nLike Germany, the USA is a middle class country.\nSweden is a democratic yet\npaternalistic country.\nEither of these two beauties\nwould form the basis for a PhD in\nsociology, yet here they are.\npopping up as facts that barely\nneed to be stated, yet alone\njustified.\nThe exhibition takes a selection\nof eight developed countries and a representative collection of things\nthat are 'designed'. We get,\ntherefore, a table full of American\nfood, another with Italian,\nEnglish, French etc., with the\nwhole thing being repeated with\nmotorcycles,clothes, and even\ntoiletries. After looking at a powerful vacuum action Swedish\nlavatory basin we learn that this\nshows 'the evidence., of a worthiness of intent discussed\nelsewhere in the world but unlike\nin Sweden never carried out'.\nAlthough the derivation of real\ntruths about the French from a disposable lighter may seem\nfunny enough, we must wait until\nwe learn of the relationship\nbetween a Sony Walkman and a Bonsai tree, as well as what can be\nread into a packet of French\nprotections feminines before\nfinally concluding that what once\nseemed a good idea has been\nturned into Pseud City. The\nchoice of exhibits has been done\nto confirm trivial s tre reo typing. It is a real pity that the idea just does not work. The designs\nthemselves show many fascinating trends, but nationalism does\nnot appear to be one of them. The\nObviously French disposable\nlighter...\nRobots exhibition a few months\nago recieved praise from all\nquarters, and surely design really\nis interesting. Within the environs\nof the V&A the contrast with the\nbits of stone and pieces of cloth\nshows how a facelift for a museum can mean a lot more\nthan a new roof and cleaning the\nstonework outside.\nThe Boilerhouse is planning a move to the Docklands soon,\nwhich is a shame from the point of\nview of students at IC. Even when\nit is no longer a short walk down\nExhibition Road, and becomes a long ride down the District Line,\nit will be worth a visit.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE qualified for the finals of University\nChallenge on Monday by beating Birmingham in the quarter\nfinals and Edinburgh in the semi-finals. This followed their\nvictories over Somerville College, Oxford and Queens, Belfast,\nbefore Easter. The team, comprising Dick Langstaff (captain),\nTim Williams, Simon Errington and Duncan Swan, have been\naccompanied by enthusiastic supporters from College on each of\nthe three nights that they have competed at the Granada TV\nStudios in Manchester. The final will be played on Tuesday 30\nApril.\nThere were some nail-biting\nmoments for IC, but all the team\nmembers contributed equally,\nwith very few wrong answers.\nRegular watchers of University\nChallenge have observed less of a bias towards the arts this year, in\nthe questions. In previous years,\nscience questions have tended to\nbe trivial, whereas a detailed\nknowledge of the arts has been\nrequired\nQuestion master Bamber\nGascoigne seemed surprised by\nIC's micrometer 'Mike' which he\ndescribed as 'much the heaviest\nmascot to appear on the\nprogramme'.\nHow they reached the finals\nIn the first round IC beat\nSommerville College, Oxford by\n485 to 225, then Queens, Belfast\nby 280 to 240. In the quarter-final\nthey beat Birmingham 260 to 200\nand in the semi-final beat\nEdinburgh 365 to 210. Jesus\nCollege beat Cains 545 to 440,\nfollowed by Birmingham 310 to\n255. They beat Cardiff in the\nsemi-final 285 to 250.\nThis is only the third time that\na London College has reached\nthe final, and if Imperial win, it\nwill be a first for the University.\nFifty supporters will attend the\nfinal\u2014Jen has a list.\nNUS take\ncontrol\nIC BAR PRICES may rise\nsubstantially after a National\nStudent Services Organisation\nwas founded during the second\nStudent Services Conference at\nBirmingham University during the\nEaster Vacation.\nThe new NUS organised body\nwill take over negotiation with\nnational suppliers of, for\nexample, beer, to obtain\nsubstantial discounts for the\nstudent unions involved. This\nreplaces the Bars Working Party\nthrough whom Imperial obtains\ndiscounts on beer, spirits, wine\nand soft drinks, as well as other\nconsortia involving paper\nsupplies, stationary, food, and so\non. The new body will exclude\nunions not in NUS from\nbenefiting from these discounts\nas from 1 Janaury 1987.\nRight from the start of the\nconference it was clear that petty\nstudent politics were more\nimportant to the majority of the\ndelegates than commer ical sense\nand benefits. Despite dogged\nattempts by the ULU, QMC,\nChelsea UCL and IC delegates,\nthe conference moved the\nexclusion amendment. This was\npassed by 33 votes to 32 (after\ntwo recounts).\nFree!

    "content": "SAILING\nIC Victory\nA team from the Sailing Club\ntravelled to Holland to compete\nin the Tilburg International team\nracing competition, over Easter.\nWith a total of three English\nteams entering, and the usual\nstrong entry from the Dutch\nUniversities it was obviously\ngoing to be difficult to match our\nconvincing victory last year.\nThe sailing, held on a lake in\nthe middle of a safari park,\nsurpassed all expectations. The\nfirst race against Leiden saw\nJones execute a masterful port\ntack start and cross the entire\nfleet, only to be recalled on a technicality. Leiden sailed a different course to most of the\nImperial team but Bevans\nappraisal of the situation meant\nImperial held a narrow lead\nthrough-out.\nSheffield A, the current\nNational Polytechnic Champions, faced Imperial next.\nSeconds before the start,\ncontrary to all predictions, the\nwind picked up to a healthy force\n6, and seconds after the start\nBrimlow and Leon wiped out.\nConditions continued to\ndeteriorate, and racing was\nabandoned.\nThe following day dawned with\na more moderate wind but heavy\nsnow. Bevan, sailing the aptly\nnamed 'Un pe u bleu' led the team\nto victory after victory. Sheffield\nB, Nautikos and Utretch all fell\nvictim to an Imperial team fueled\nwith chip but ties. Bevan's a gres sive tactics of sinking the\nopposition, combined with\nJones's ability to bribe the\norganisation, paid dividends as\nthe Imperial team reached the\nfinals.\nOvernight conditions had\nchanged drastically; 'Twister'\nLeon was undisputed 'Pinball\nKing' and Rudge and Burrows\nwere unbeaten at table football.\nBrimlow was still searching in\nvain for some Yorkshire\nPudding. It was a very, very\nconfident Imperial team which\nmet Sheffield A the following day\nin the decisive race. Approaching the first mark Imperial held 2,\n3, 4 but Brimlow stopped to\nrelocate the buoy. With Imperial\nnow in a losing 2, 3, 6 position\nBevan and Jones set off after the\nleading Sheffield boat. At the\nfinal mark some totally unsubtle\npumping by Jones enabled him\nto obtain an overlap, and soon\nImperial gained a victorious 1, 2,\n6 combination. This was a superb result against a team that\nhad lost only one race in the last\nyear.\nThe tournament was as\nenjoyable as ever, and all who\nwent look forward to competing\nagain next year.\nRIFLE\nYoung guns\ngo for it\nFull-bore, if you didn't know,\nmeans real, grown-up bullets. Big\nones. We can't use them in the\nsports centre without sending\nthem through the wall, into the\nbasement of Student Services.\nHands up, Michael Arthur, we\nwant your money.\nThis is a challenging event in\nseveral ways. The competition is\nheld over 300 and 600 yards. The\nequipment is unfamiliar. The\nshooter's ability counts for\neverything\u2014no advantage can\nbe gained by using a favourite,\nsouped-up gun. And the climate\nis weird. In the one day, we had\nwind, rain, sun, mist and snow.\nRemember that telescopic sights\nare a no-no, which makes poor\nlight a serious blow.\nScoring was by aggregate of\nthe best four members in each\nteam, resulting in a victory for\nRCS with 332 points, followed by\nGuilds with 297, and RSM with\n285. In fairness, it has to be said\nthat there were only the\nminimum four members in the\nMines team, but then how many\nMiners would you trust with a firearm?\nThere was a trophy for the\nbest marksman of the day. So\nhow to go about getting it? There\nare differing approaches to\nshooting. The most basic\ninvolves making oneself comfy,\nthen just pulling the trigger. This\nis at best only fairly successful.\nThe next stage of sophistication\nis practised by most shooters.\nPut your elbows in such-and-such a place, hold your breath,\nuse an eye patch, don't hang on\ntarget for more than six seconds,\nconcentrate on the trigger, and\nso on. The big snag is that all this\ntechnical stuff induces stress in\nthe sportsman. Think it\nover\u2014the barrel must not shake\nin the slightest, or the shot will\nstray. Nervous fingers just aren't steady enough for the best\nresult. The Zen approach is the\nonly way for the expert. The\nwhole being of the shooter\nfocussed in the tip of his fingers.\nAn undergraduate from\nAeronautics department got it\njust right\u2014the only sign of life\nwhilst he was sighting, being the\ngleam of his eyes in the gathering\ndark. The snow which fell on\nPaul Claydon was last to melt\nwhen the sun came out. He\naccepted the award with middle-distance gaze and twitch y smile\nof a man who is, frankly, more\ncontent behind a gun than\nanywhere else. He slept\nthought out the return journey,\neyes switching open only at the\nsound of breech-blocks being\nput into store.\nTRACK & FIELD\nAthletics squad\nproposed\nJohn Pope, track and field\nsecretary for the Cross-Country\nClub, has been appointed to\nencourage wider support for\ntrack and field athletics within\nCollege.\nSupport at present is\ndisappointing considering the\npart the activity plays in the\n'professional' sporting calender.\nFurthermore, there is talent and\ninterest which could be\ncombined to produce a strong\nCollege team.\nThe one major event for\nCollege athletics this season is\non 30 April/1 May and so we\nneed as much support as\npossible very soon. Two\nevenings of competition are all\nthat is asked, be you world\nsuperstar or competent jogger.\nThe latter may well be more\nimportant as Goldsmith's won\nlast year purely by fielding a complete squad. John Pope is\nnot alone in thinking that\nImperial can field a better squad\nand hope it will. If people are\nprepared to turn up for this event\nplease contact John or CrossCountry Club via the Union\nOffice.\nThe long term intention is to\nform a track and field athletic\nsquad, but this is the ideal time to\nassess support and for\nintroductions to be made. People\ncan be entered for their fixtures if\nthey wish as well.\nWill two evenings of revision\nmake that much difference to\nexam results?\n14 Friday 26 April 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022Designing new plants, making cheese\nmature more quickly, and cleaving DNA. All\nthis and much more has been achieved in the\nfascinating field of BIOTECHNOLOGY.\n\u2022Our Science Correspondent reports on this\nfast-developing subject which has already\nbrought together researchers from\ndisciplines as far apart as Chemistry and\nElectrical Engineering.\nOnly in recent years has biotechnology received a great deal of\nattention\u2014but people have been successfully using the\nprinciples involved for thousands of years for the preparation of\nsuch things as bread, wine and cheese. However for\nbiotechnology to reach its full potential in the future close\ncollaboration is needed between scientists with many different\nareas of expertise, such as biologists, chemists, physicists and\nengineers. It was with this in mind that Professor Brian Hartley\ninitiated the setting up of the Centre for Biotechnology at\nImperial College. The Centre was established in 1982 in parts of\nexisting College buildings which were refurbished. In late 1984\nthe new seven floor building was completed and is attached to\nthe Chemistry and Biochemistry Departments and adjacent to\nthe Fermentation and Extraction Pilot Plant of Imperial\nBiotechnology Ltd.\nFriday 26 April 1985\nPilot Plant\nThe Pilot Plant was built in 1965 and is\nunique in that there is no other plant like it\nattached to an academic institution in this\ncountry. In 1982 Imperial Biotechnology Ltd\ncame into existence, and has an exclusive\nten year lease on the Pilot Plant, with the\nCentre still having access to its facilities. The\ncompany undertakes contracts from\nindustry, and academic and government\ninstitutions from all over the world, and is\nalso hoping to market its own products\nwhich will mainly be enzymes. For example,\nin the production of cheeses such as\ncheddar, the ripening process takes six to\nnine months, and an enzyme is being\ndeveloped which will reduce this period to\ntwo to three months, without affecting the\nquality of the cheese.\nMr G Banks is the Director of Operations\nat the Pilot Plant and also a lecturer at the\nCentre. He has been involved in the\ndev elopement of a wide range of new\nfermentation processes both for the Centre\nand for outside contracts. Collaboration\nbetween Biogen and the Pilot Plant led to the\nfirst large scale (3,000 litre) production of an\nin te fer on by a genetically engineered\norganism. The material produced has been\nused for clinical trials, and the process\ndeveloped at the Pilot Plant was used on\nproduction scale in Austria.\nThe Centre has an academic core staff of\nsix and there are many staff throughout the\nCollege involved in work relevant to\nbio ch no logy. Research at the Centre\nincludes work on genetic and protein\nengineering, bio sensors, microbial\nmetabolism and fermentation technology.\nComputers Smell\nComputers that can taste and smell are\nreminiscent of science fiction, but the work\nof Dr Case with bio sensors shows it could be\na real possibility. The bio sensors that he is\nworking on combine the high specificity and\ncatalytic activity of enzymes with\nsophisticated modern electronics to produce\nsensitive and specific analyse rs.A paracetamol sensor which could be used by\nhospital staff to rapidly assess the extent of\nan overdose is being worked on, along with a pesticide sensor to measure the extent of\nwater pollution.\nBiosensors with the potential to do rapid\nquantitative analysis, can be manufactured\ncheaply and can be used by untrained staff.\nClinically the fact that they can be used for an\nanalyses on liv ng systems is a major step\nforward.' They provide an economically\nviable alternative to existing analytical\nmethods which may involve lengthy\nlaboratory analysis. The work is a good\nexample of how interdepartmental\ncollaboration can work, with Biotechnology\nCentre working closely with members of the\nDepartments of Chemistry and Electrical\nEngineering on the dev elopement of the\nbio sensors. \u2022 ;\nNew Plants\nThe work of Dr C Lichtenstem with plant\ngenetic engineering is aimed at producing\nnew plant varieties. Plants could be given\nresistance to herbicides, making weed\ncontrol much easier, or resistance to viruses.\nIf the protein quality of plants can be\nimproved they will be more nutritious\nproviding an alternative food source to meat.\nThe production costs for plants would be\nconsiderably less than those for meat. The\nwork is based on the fact that some bacterial\ncan induce tumour growth in plants, with the\ntumour resulting from the transfer of DNA\nfrom the bacteria to the plant leading to\nexpression of the foreign genes in the plant.\nEnzymes are used to cleave the DNA so\nthat the genes responsible for the tumour\nformation can be replaced with the desired\ngenes. The major advantage over classical\nplant breeding methods is that the plants can\ngiven exactly the required properties and no\nothers.\nStereospecific\nMicro-organisms can carry out an\nenormous range of chemical transformations and by understanding the pathways\ninvolved it may be possibly to steer the\nmetabolism to new and desired products.\nProfessor D Ribbons and Dr D Leak are\nlooking at microbial metabolism and\nphysiology, which has a number of\napplications for work in the Centre and in\nother departments. There are some microorganism able to carry out chemical\ntransformations product ing intermediates of\nknown stereochemistry which would\notherwise be difficult to produce. Joint\nresearch with the Chemistry Department is\nusing this ability in the chemical synthesis of\nanalogues of naturally occurring pesticides.\nThey are also looking at the possibility of\nusing micro-organisms to carry out other\nchemical transformations which involve\nproblems such as low yields and mixtures of\nproducts when standard syn then tic methods\nare used. Another collaboration involving\nmembers of the Metallurgy, and the Mineral\nResources Department and the\nBiotechnology Centre is using a microorganism to leach ores out of later it e minerals such as bauxite, and to concentrate\nthem. Some micro-organisms are able to\naccumulate up to four times their weight of\nthe metal. There is also joint work within the\nCentre using13 C,'H,2 H,31P, and19 F nuclear\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy to obtain\nmeasurements on living micro-organisms. In\nthis way information can be obtained about\nthe regulation and times scales of microbial\nmetabolic pathways.\nAlthough the Centre has only been in\nexistence for a short while it has already\nforged substantial research links with the\nrest of the College and hopes to increase\nthese in the future. The fact that Imperial\nCollege has a great strength of research in\nmost areas is a great advantage for\ninterdisciplinary work. The Centre also has\nlinks with government institutions and links\nwith industry which include funding. There is\nan MSc course available at the Centre for up\nto twelve students, with a BSc in\nbiotech no l gy available via the life sciences\ncourse. It seems that the Centre is now able\nto meet the needs for interdisciplinary\nteaching and research that initiated its\ndevelopment.\n9\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSJ\nANOTHER\nSHOCK HORROR PROBE\n\"Arthur was SS Officer\"\nIT WAS ALLEGED this week that Michael Arthur was a senior officer\nin the notorious imperial SS'. Indeed some extreme sources suggest\nthat he still holds office in the SS.\n'Prince' Michael was quick to refute these allegations, citing his\nextreme youthful appearance as evidence that he could not possibly\nhave held more than 'honorary rank' during the last war.\nThe following press release was issued from Imperial SS\nheadquarters in 'Princes' Gardens.\nSUMMER VACATION WORK Introduction\nDuring the Summer vacation, many of the\nCollege's residences are let to visitors from\noutside the College. The income from these\nschemes is essential if reasonable rents in the\nresidences are to be maintained. The various\nSummer Letting Schemes offer a number of\njobs for the vacation period. These vary from\nchallenging full-time managerial posts to\npart-time cleaning work. In general the work\nis well paid and interesting and free\naccommodation is provided.\nThe schemes fall into two distinct\ncategories. The SAC scheme operates in\nLinstead Hall and part of Southside and\nprovides a standard hotel bed and breakfast\nservice catering for conferences and other\nshort stay visitors. This is run under the\nauspices of the Conference Office. The other\ncategory includes Evelyn Gardens, Hamlet\nGardens and Beit Hall and provides a more\nbasic and less expensive form of\naccommodation where the clients tends to\nbe students from other colleges staying for\nfairly long periods. These schemes are run by\nStudent Services. For all the schemes,\nmarketing is carried out centrally but during\nthe actual period most of the work of running\nand maintaining the schemes is carried out\nby students.\nThe Schemes\nSAC\nThis is the most prestigious of the four\nschemes and requires a large work force\nnecessary to maintain high standards. The\noffice and reception desk is based in the\nfoyer of Linstead Hall and is run by a member\nof the Conference Office staff together with\nAssistant Managers, Night Managers,\nCashiers and Receptionists. The reception\ndesk is manned day and night throughout the\nSummer vacation. Guests are welcomed\nregistered and billed on arrival by the\nreception team and shown to their rooms by\na porter.\nBehind the scenes, the cleaners prepare\nup to 400 rooms which involves changing and\nmaking beds, cleaning wash basins and\nbathrooms and vacuuming carpets. All this\nhas to be done in the morning in four hours.\nCleaners work in pairs, under the\nsupervision of the Housekeeper and a co-or d in at or, servicing 24 rooms and three sets\nof bathroom facilities on a staircase.\nEvelyn Gardens\nThis is the largest of the three schemes\noperated by Student Services, with up to 400\nguests at any one time. All three schemes are\nrun by assistant managers under the\nsupervision of a co-or d in at or. The Evelyn\nGardens scheme is staffed by four assistant\nmanagers and eight cleaners. The assistant\nmanagers run an office, act as receptionists,\nmaintain booking charts, collect rent,\noperate the accounting system and\nsupervise the cleaners. The cleaners clean\nrooms, change sheets and act as porters.\nHamlet Gardens\nAt Hamlet Gardens, three assistant\nmanagers run 39 flats which provide\naccommodation for around 250 guests.\nTraditionally, the three managers have done\nthe cleaning themselves in order to increase\ntheir earnings. Whether or not we have\ncleaners this year will be decided in\nconsultation with the new managers. The\nmanagers duties are similar to those of the\nEvelyn Gardens managers. Many of the flats\nare organised so as to provide fairly basic\naccommodation but a number of the best\nflats are let fully equip ed to families at a higher rent.\nBeit Hall\nBeit Hall is son je what different from the\nother schemes in a number of ways. In the\nfirst place it is much smaller with only 110\nrooms. Also, the housekeeper of Beit Hall is\nheavily involved with the Vacation Lettings\nand the SAC office provides the reception\nfacilities for the Beit Scheme. As a result of\nthese factors we only need one assistant\nmanager and two cleaners for Beit. The\nassistant manager is responsible for raising\nall invoices, making sure that guests pay on\ntime and also acts as an assistant to the\nhousekeeper.\nAll students who work in the Summer\nletting schemes are offered free\naccommodation and a competitive wage.\nThose who work for the whole Summer, are\neligible for a bonus. Wages, hours and bonus\nrates are as follows:-Position Hours/week Wages\nAssistant Managers 39 \u00a385pw \u00a3100-\u00a3300\nNight Managers 33 (average) \u00a370pw \u00a3t00 \u00a3300\nReceptionists\nm \u00a370-\u00a3200\nCashiers \u00a352pw \u00a350-\u00a3150\nCleaners and\nCo-or dina tors \u202211 \u2022HI \u2022 \u00a3L80/hr \u00a330-\u00a3100\nPorters 1I \u2022 1\n1 \u2022 I1 \u00a31.80/hr \u00a330-\u00a3100\nCo-or dina tors receive a \u00a310 per week\nresponsibility payment in addition to the\nabove rate. The hours given for co-or dina tors, cleaners and porters represent a guaranteed minimum it is anticipated that\nadditional hours will be available for those\nwho require them.
