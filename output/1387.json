    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Alex Casey\n23\nFriday 16 November 2007 felix\nSpot the odd one out...\nAnime-niacs resurrect the world\nF\nilms can have a significant\nimpact on the audience; between the everyday fillers\nof Hollywood no-brainer\nblockbusters a bright spark\nappears every blue moon, signifying\nthe culmination of some truly talented directors, actors, composers,\ncinematographers and scriptwriters.\nSuch films are highly emotive and in-telligent, and present the viewer with a\nunique experience.\nUsually animated films or series are\nnot coupled with such a positive de-scription, but there is one I am particularly passionate about and urge\neveryone with the slightest inkling of\ncuriosity to go and see; you will not\nonly be surprised, but transfixed on the\ntruly spectacular imaginative method\nof storytelling and its uncanny ability\nto force the viewer to question his or\nher own role in the grand scheme of\nlife. Neon Genesis Evangelion is nothing short of breathtaking.\nAt the dawn of the new millennium,\nthe planet was ravaged by a devastating\nshockwave emanating from Antarctica. The icy continent instantly melted,\nand sea levels rose at exponential rates.\nCities were flooded and entire civilisations were submerged. During the\npost-apocalyptic wars, over half of the\nworld\u2019s population perished.\nOfficially, a small meteorite, traveling\nclose to the speed of light, crashed into\nthe South Pole, causing the catastro-phe. However, the lone survivor of\nthe scientific expedition based there,\nMisato Katsuragi, witnessed a beam of\nlight emerge from the ruins of Antarctica shortly before the event \u2013 know as\nSecond Impact \u2013 occurred. Its wings\nearned it the designation of an Angel.\nFifteen year later, a young boy named\nShinji Ikari is summoned to Tokyo-3\nby his father, the commander of Nerv.\nUpon arriving, the city is attacked by\nan enormous, humanoid being, one\nwhich the military appears powerless\nto stop. After fifteen years, the Angels\nhave returned. He is taken deep underground by the now adult Katsuragi,\nwho introduces him to mankind\u2019s last\nhope \u2013 the Evangelions. Humanoid in\nappearance, covered in thick armour,\nhighly maneuverable and armed with\nnothing but close-quarter blades,\nShinji is ordered to take it out into the\nstreets and defend the city against the\nmysterious Angel. With a severely-injured pilot, Rei Ayanami, lying in his\narms, he vows to himself that he will\nnot run away from his fears and makes\nthat fateful decision to pilot Evangelion\nUnit One.\nAnd so begins the greatest piece of\nanimation ever made. Shinji Ikari, the\ncentral figure of NGE, is not your typical hero, and nor is NGE your typical\nmecha robot science fiction serial. The\n14-year old pilot was abandoned by his\nfather after his mother died when he\nwas very young; he has little self-con-fidence, shies away from anything he is\nafraid of, and holds no respect whatsoever for his father, who is an uncom-promising, brutal, and enigmatic man.\nIn fact, you could say that Shinji is the\ncomplete opposite of a hero, which is\nwhy NGE is initially so interesting to\nwatch \u2013 commonly, the central character in anime is brave, bold and will\nprotect everyone around him no matter what. Observing Shinji as he battles\nagainst the Angels \u2013 and his inner demons \u2013 is a refreshing experience.\nNGE itself is, as aforementioned, incredibly atypical of animation in gen-eral. Whereas the typical anime traits\nare present, the series has three primary hooks that most modern films lack.\nFirstly, it constantly upholds a sense of\nmystery, intentionally omitting information and showing you events that\nleave you puzzled and, most impor-tantly, intrigued. For example, what are\nthe Angels? Why is it only those born\nafter the Second Impact can pilot the\nEvangelions? What are the true motives of the characters?\nOne of the earliest mysteries arises\nafter Shinji\u2019s Evangelion Unit One defeats the Third Angel \u2013 its armour re-moved, the viewer can clearly see mus-cles, organic eyes, and blood covering\nthe unit. Perhaps the Evangelions are\nnot so robotic after all. With twists and\nturns in every episode, one eventually\nbegins to doubt their perceptions of\neach individual character, including\nthe pilots themselves.\nNothing in NGE is what it seems,\nand the story is one of the most imaginative ever conceived. Using ancient\nphilosophy and Christian and Biblical\nApocrypha, the symbolism used in the\nseries is awe-inspiring and has a long-lasting impact on the viewer.\nNGE\u2019s second hook is the characters\nthemselves, and the personal journeys\nthey take right up until they final, icon-Robin George Andrews explores beyond the apocalypse with the Anime flick, Neon Genesis Evangelion\nic scene. Shinji Ikari is, as described\nabove, not your typical hero. Rei Ayanami, the young pilot of Evangelion\nUnit Zero, is introverted, quiet, and\nas enigmatic as Shinji\u2019s father, Gendo\nIkari. She appears willing to follow any\norder, even if it means it will lead to her\ndeath. Almost completely emotionless\napart from a few key moments, she is\nperhaps the biggest mystery of NGE,\none that will keep you guessing even\nafter the credits begin roll.\nMisato Katsuragi is a rising officer in\nNerv, and one that also acts as Shinji\u2019s\nguardian. The only one to see Second\nImpact first hand, she knows the devastation that the Angels and humankind\ncan cause, and is willing to do anything\nto prevent a Third Impact occurring.\nHowever, many secrets and answers to\nlong-held questions are kept even from\nher by the head of the scientific divi-sion, Ritsuko Akagi. A cold and efficient woman, she prioritises the future\nof mankind and the progress of the\nEvangelions over the lives of the pilots;\nfurthermore, she knows far more than\nshe ever lets on, keeping most of the\norganisation in the dark about both the\npast and the present.\nPersonally, the pilot of Evangelion\nUnit Two is my favourite character\nfrom not only this anime, but from fiction as a whole. Asuka Langley Soryu is\nan incredibly endearing character, and\nis often the antithesis of Rei Ayanami\n\u2013 brash, open, highly extroverted and\nthe only pilot who enjoys defending\nTokyo-3 from the Angels. Showing incredible skill in piloting the Evangelions, she is highly competitive, particularly with Shinji, who she likes to tease\nand poke fun at.\nAsuka, despite being highly volatile\nand excitable, also has her own dark\npast which is slowly revealed throughout the series, and during the final\nepisodes her past comes back to haunt\nher and her life begins to fall apart. To\nsee such a lovable character descend\ninto her own spiral of devastation and\nloss is painful, and you cannot help but\nfeel strongly empathetic towards her.\nAsuka is as amusing and charming as\nshe is tragic and emotive, and as such\nis the arguably the best character in the\nseries.\nNGE\u2019s final hook is its presentation\nand pacing. The first half of the series\nbuilds on all the characters\u2019 personalities and develops the story without\nleaving too many mysteries unsolved;\nhowever, during the second half,\nmany of the events that occur can be\ninterpreted in many different ways,\nthe character\u2019s motives change more\nexplicitly, and as the war against the\nAngels hits closer and closer to home,\nthe viewer is subject to a high degree of\ncharacter introspection.\nThe viewer joins the three pilots and\nthe supporting cast as they reminisce\nabout their past, rethink their objec-tives, and reveal dark mysteries, the\nmajority of which answer some questions whilst raising many more. With\ninnovative animation techniques, excellent scripting, and a truly immerse\nplot, one cannot help but get totally\nabsorbed in the lives of all the characters involved.\nThe motion picture that followed the\nseries, End of Evangelion, chronicles\nthe three pilots\u2019 journeys to the end of\nthe world, with startling imagery and\nintense action and drama sequences,\nmatchingifnotexceedingthatofthese-ries. There is so much about the series\nI wish I could talk about, but I cannot,\nor it will spoil the story for you \u2013 safe\nto say, you will think about the ending\nfor a long time after it concludes.\nIn this contemporary setting, an excellent plot, incredible characters, a\nstunning score, blistering action, drama and science-fiction, and of course\nsuperb animation, come together to\nform something very special, but not\nnecessarily unique. However, this se-ries, consisting of twenty-six episodes,\nhas such depth, such emotion, such a\nstrong bond to the viewer that it refuses to let go of all its graces with its pres-ence. Recently voted the best anime of\nall time by several publications in both\nthe US and Japan, and credited with\npushing anime into the mainstream,\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a legendary\npiece of animation, one that deserves\nto be seen by everyone. See the world\nthrough the eyes of Shinji, Rei, and Asuka, and you will be forever hooked.\nThis is the eternal answer to the\nWestern stereotype that animation is\nexclusively designed for children. Not\nonly will this change how you think,\nbut it will change you as a person.\nThat, I guarantee.\nLeft: The NGE family. Right: A clever costume choice can detract from an unfortunate lack of facial features\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 felix Friday 16 November 2007\nScience\nScience Editor \u2013 Ed Henley\nHere is a picture with somebody pictured in it\nThe LHC: Microscope or telescope?\nThe Large Hadron Collider, or LHC,\ndue to start operations at CERN next\nMay has received enough coverage for\nmany of you to be aware of its principle\naim: the search for the Higgs boson.\nDoubtless you\u2019ll also know that it is\nthis particle which is thought to be responsible for providing mass to all the\nother particles found in the zoo of the\nstandard model.\nHowever, what may not be so familiar is that though the LHC is probing\nthe very smallest scales of the universe,\nit will also be providing a wealth of information relevant to cosmologists examining the very largest, telling them\nabout the structure and history of the\nuniverse as a whole.\nJohn Ellis nimbly straddled the gulf\nbetween these two extremes at his\nlecture in the Great Hall on Tuesday,\nexplaining what he thought the fundamental questions were at both scales,\nand outlining how this new accelerator,\nas much a telescope as a microscope,\nmight be able to resolve many of them.\nTackling the small side first, he introduced the Higgs boson using David\nMiller\u2019s well-known analogy of a celebrity (say Einstein) moving through\na cocktail party \u2013 the party apparently\nbeing a decent representation of the\nhubbub of particles present in seemingly empty space. Much as people\nclustering round the celebrity impede\nhis motion and provide him with an\neffectively heavier \u2018mass\u2019, a standard-model particle moving through the\nHiggs field (which permeates all space,\nand is linked to the Higgs boson) is also\nslowed from light-speed by its interaction with this field, gaining mass in the\nprocess. There were tantalising clues in\nthe last days of the LEP experiment that\nthe Higgs boson may have been seen,\nbut only a more careful search with the\nLHC is likely to find the Higgs directly,\nor to place stronger limits on its energy\nthan the official LEP results.\nCareful is an understatement when\nit comes to looking for evidence of\nphysics relevant at the other end of the\nscale. The concordance model of the\nuniverse settled on by astrophysicists\nand cosmologists ascribes only 4% of\nthe universe to matter as we know it \u2013\nthe rest is in the form of cold dark matter (29%) or the even more mysterious\ndark energy (67%). Trying to explain\nthe universe without an understanding of these last two is hopeless; fortunately Ellis believes that sifting through\nthe torrents of data flowing from the\nLHC (coining a new unit, equivalent\nto finding a needle in a haystack, he\nquoted the task as being on the order\nof 100,000 haystacks) might provide\njust this.\nSome of the contenders for explain-John Ellis thinks it might be both. Not only will it tell us about the Higgs Boson, but by investigating supersymmetry it may shed light on the dark matter thought to influence the largest structures of our universe\ning dark matter are the massive equivalents to the standard model particles,\npredicted by the theory of super-sym-metry, or SUSY. Though these \u2018sparticles\u2019 have not yet been incontrovertibly\nseen in any colliders, he thinks they\nstand a chance of being indirectly observed by LHC \u2013 an departure from\nenergy being carried out by normal\nparticles equally in all directions might\nsuggest energy has been carried out by\nan unobservable dark-energy particle\nin such a way as to have preserved the\nisotropic distribution.\nFor more on the LHC book to see\nJim Virdee\u2019s lecture on the 21st \u2013\ngo to IC\u2019s Events page for details.\nEdmund Henley\nScience Editor\nOur Island Story, or How the Island Rule to come to an End (best beloved)\nWomen like pink because their eyes\nhad to get used to finding similarly coloured berries when we were all hunter-gatherers. Kids don\u2019t like eating their\ngreens because they\u2019ve evolved to be\nwary of potentially toxic plants. Blood\nis red because it signals danger when\nspilled!\n\u2018Just-so\u2019 stories seem to be everywhere in evolutionary theory some-times; it\u2019s one of the main criticisms of\nnatural selection from the Intelligent\nDesign camp. The trouble is that these\nstories are popular because often they\ndo seem to make sense, and it\u2019s difficult to prove them wrong.\nOne of the less absurd ones is The\nIsland Rule. Remember the Hobbit?\nBack in 2003 a bunch of anthropologists discovered some fossils of mini-people, which were eventually nicknamed \u2018hobbits\u2019 and given their own\nspecies in 2005; Homo floresiensis, or\n\u2018Man of Flores\u2019.\nFlores is a small island in the Indonesian archipelago, and its fossilised hobbits are meant to be a prime example\nof the Island Rule. Others include tiny\nelephants weighing in at just 100 kilos,\nand enormous rats. The idea is that on\nsufficiently small islands, small mammals have fewer predators, so evolve to\ngrow larger, whereas big animals don\u2019t\nhave enough food, so become smaller\nover successive generations.\nKind of makes sense, but a new study\nled by Dr Shai Meiri has produced\nfindings which suggest that this particular \u2018just-so\u2019 story might also be less\nthan accurate.\nPrevious studies which backed up the\nIsland Rule ended up being criticised\nfor numerous reasons. Some used unreliable indicators of size, looked at islands that were too big, or compared\ngiant or dwarf animals with related animals on the mainland that turned out\nto be not particularly related at all.\nSo Dr Meiri and her team rounded up\nrecords of numerous different papers\non island mammal sizes and filtered\nthem for studies that met their strict\ncriteria, before doing a meta-analysis\non the whole lot. They found that there\nwas indeed some significant evidence\nof size change on islands, but it didn\u2019t\nseem to be related to the original size\nof the particular creature.\nCarnivores did seem to get smaller,\nwhile rodents and artiodactyls \u2013 that\u2019s\nungulates like cattle, pigs and camels,\nnot flying dinosaurs \u2013 got bigger, but\nthere was no overall trend for small\nanimals to become giants or big ones\nto shrink. In the paper \u201cThe island\nrule: made to be broken?\u201d published in\nProc. Royal Soc. B last week, the team\npoint out that the hobbit-men of Flores\nshared the island with full-sized Stegodon, not miniature ones.\nIt\u2019s always worth speculating on our\nhistory, but as these findings have\nshown, there\u2019s bound to be dangers in\nover-simplifying things. Like anything\nwe learn about biology, a mammal\u2019s\nsize is due to a complex interplay of\nthousands of factors \u2013 whether it\u2019s on\nan island or not.\nImran Khan\nAs many versions of SUSY lead quite\nnaturally to dark matter, they may well\nexplain why the matter in galaxies appears to be distributed utterly unlike\nthe motion of those galaxies would\nsuggest \u2013 dark matter is required to\nexplain this motion. Further causes for\nthe present size and structure of the\nuniverse may come from ripples in an\nanalogue to the Higgs field, the \u2018inflaton\u2019 field. \u2018Valleys\u2019 in this rippled field\nwould have attracted matter, leading\nto the denser regions observed in the\nearly universe by the WMAP cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation, and\nalso seen in the universe today.\nBetter understanding of this latter\ntopic should be forthcoming, with the\nimminent launch of the Planck satellite,\nbut Prof. Ellis\u2019 message \u2013 that the LHC\ncontribution is not restricted to the\nvery small \u2013 means much understanding of the universe will in fact be gained\nby looking inwards instead of out.\nIsland. The Rule would predict\nsome pretty big animals - wrong?\nThe search for the \u2018God Particle\u2019 at the LHC goes on in tunnels like the one above, which lead to chambers so vast they can only be described as\ncathedrals to science. There\u2019s a long waiting list, but it\u2019s well worth booking up ahead to see this marvel if you\u2019re passing through Geneva\n\n"

A group of students working outside in the freezing\ncold painting and cutting wood can\nonly mean one thing, its time for the\nLord Mayor\u2019s Show (LMS).\nThe City and Guilds College Union\nwas honoured to represent Imperial in\nthe annual parade to celebrate the Lord\nMayor of the City of London. This year,\nas is generally the case, the story of the\nCGCU float began less then a week before the show with a \u201cdesign\u201d that was\nscrawled on the back of a set of lecture\nnotes. Here is the story:\nT-minus 119 hours: (to the start\nof the parade)\nThe \u201cActing\u201d LMS Coordinator suddenly realised how little he has been\nacting and with five days to go starts\nfrantically calling lorry companies to\nget one arranged. The hours tick by\nand an angel in the form of Gunns\nTransport appears.\nT-minus 115 hours:\nAfter rejoicing in the success of getting a lorry the CGCU office is thrown\ninto disarray by a very distressed phone\ncall from the LMS office. Apparently\nthey had not received payment and\nwere considering pulling the CGCU\nfloat from the parade. A quick check\nof the accounts showed the money\nfrom the BP sponsorship hadn\u2019t come\nthrough yet. A call to BP solved this\nand a cheque was written and posted\n(thank god for the phrase \u201cThe cheque\nis in the post\u201d).\nT-minus 95 hours:\nArmed with the knowledge that having a lorry is no good if you have nothing to put on it and the fact that there is\na distinct lack of building suppliers in\nthe South Kensington area we quickly\narranged for a delivery of the estimated\namount, aka a complete guess, of wood\nand nails. An attempt was made at improving the design but it was scrapped\nas it looked worse than the initial concept drawing.\nT-minus 71 hours:\nA very \u201chelpful\u201d delivery man, who\nasked no questions, dumped our supplies in college so construction could\ncommence. We must congratulate Imperial students for their principles in\nthat nothing was stolen from the pile\nthat lay at the side of the road for two\ndays.\nT-minus 66 hours:\nConstruction began, still with no official design. First blood was drawn.\nAfter abandoning any hope of proper\nconstruction, chicken wire became our\nmedium of choice. A whopping 22.5m\nof mesh tubing was born.\nT-minus 44 hours:\nThe faculty car park was besieged.\nHaving the \u201cbest\u201d location in college\nfor construction, despite it being only\nEdward Judge\nCGCU Honorary Secretary\nThe CGCU float (left) and CGCU motorised mascot Bo\u2019 (right) being towed by a massive truck\nhalf as high as the float, we set about\nreal construction. This was halted\nquickly once the lack of tools became\napparent.\nT-minus 43 hours:\nThe CGCU offices were raided and\nfour \u201csaws\u201d were obtained. However,\nthe first three good ones we tried\nproved incapable of cutting wood. The\noldest saw in the world was our only\nhope. Covered in rust, the name Warrior was bestowed upon it.\nT-minus 40 hours:\nWe were tired. Construction ceased.\nT-minus 21 hours:\nThe actual amount of work remaining dawned upon us. Panic ensued. A\ntrip to Argos solved further supply issues and the construction resumed.\nT-minus 17 hours:\nThe teams were spilt and while one\npainted, the other attended a security\nbriefing that was \u201cto die for\u201d. After being told there was a serious risk of terrorism during the day the commanding\nofficer changed direction and said \u201cnot\nto worry you are much more likely to\nbe bombed next month while Christmas shopping\u201d.\nT-minus 11 hours:\nAfter removing the main parts of\ntheir float from their temporary home\nof the faculty car park we decided to\nget some warmth and devoured a midnight snack of bolognaise prepared in\nthe warmth of Jez\u2019s garage.\nT-minus 9 hours:\nWith the construction going well we\ndecided to start to pretty up the float\nwith another layer of paint. Given the\ncold weather and it being the dead of\nnight we didn\u2019t hold much hope of it\ndrying.\nT-minus 7 hours:\nDisaster struck. Our fancy mechanism for moving the ball around failed.\nThe magic of duck tape was put to\nthe test. After a quick fix we tried and\nfailed again. Things weren\u2019t looking\ngood. Finally after borrowing some extra supports everything was fine.\nT-minus 4 hours:\nAfter a sleepless night putting final\ntouches to it the lorry arrives. Everyone, wrecked and bruised, struggled\nto lift the 3m tall structure onto it and\nfinally all was done. In record time it\nwas strapped down and sent on its way\nwith Jez following inder her own steam.\nThe float was joined on the lorry by Bo\nwho was helped along Exhibition Road\nunder the careful watch of a number of\npolice.\nT-minus 3 hours:\nWith the lorry gone we grabbed everything we needed, collected 120 helium balloons and set off on the tube.\nT-minus 2.5 hours:\nWhile taking up half a tube with balloons the shit hit the fan. The overly\ntired coordinator had left our all important documentation in the office.\nWith a quick fix of someone running\nback in place we continued on hoping\nto meet up with everyone.\nT-minus 1 hour:\nAll aboard. We all piled on the lorry\ntied down the balloons and headed off.\nFinally the hard work was done.\nWith the show completed and having\npassed without incident we dumped\nthe float [Editor \u2013 which remained outside the Skempton building for the next\nfour days, much to the irritation of the\nUnion which was threatened with a fine\nfrom College as a result!] and collapsed\nin the Union for a few well deserved\ndrinks. Plans for further drinking were\nsoon scrapped and a nice meal in the\nQueens Arms sufficed.\nThanks go to everyone who helped\nwith the construction and on the day.\nWe would like to especially thank BP\nfor their generous sponsorship.\nASHLEY\nBROWN\nAND\nNICK\nSIMPSON\n\n"

This week, our trip to find\nthe epic machines hidden from view in\nImperial labs takes us to the Kennedy\nInstitute on the Charing Cross cam-pus, where they are ripping apart the\nvery threads of life itself.\nLike so much of the world\u2019s coolest\nscientific equipment, the Q-TOF mass\nspectrometer is found deep in the\nbowels of the Institute\u2019s basement. But\nthat isn\u2019t always the best place to keep a\n\u00a3300,000 machine. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most\nexpensive bits of kit that we have here,\u201d\nsays Matthew Peirce, a Research Associate at the Institute, \u201cbut every once\nin a while we have sewage coming up\nthrough the floor down here.\u201d\nPeirce and his team are investigating\ncell signalling, which means that they\nare trying to figure out what exactly\nhappens when cells respond to a signal,\nsuch as a bacterial toxin. They want to\nknow what\u2019s going on at the molecular level, and which proteins are being\nproduced inside the cell.\nThe best way to find out what\u2019s inside something, as any five-year-old\nor particle physicist will tell you, is to\nsmash it into pieces. So the research\nteam makes a vat of mouse cell pep-tides, and then pops them into the\nQ-TOF spectrometer, where they are\nsprayed out as an ionized gas. Accelerate the ions through an electric cur-rent, smash them into gas molecules,\nand they conveniently break apart at\nthe amino acid bonds.\nEach fragment has a charge and each\nkind of amino acid molecule has a different mass, and so the Q-TOF spectrometer can use an electric field to\nshoot the fragments at a detector: the\nlighter they are, the faster they\u2019ll go.\nThis is the TOF in Q-TOF; it stands\nfor \u201ctime-of-flight.\u201d The detector spits\nout the results to a PC where Robin\nWait, a Senior Lecturer who operates\nthe machine, can recognise the mass\npeaks that indicate the composition of\nthe peptides.\nThe team has to make large volumes\nof cells because the Q-TOF spectrometer isn\u2019t that efficient. This requirement\nfor large samples means that they can\u2019t\nuse human tissue \u2013 for example, a patient\u2019s cells \u2013 for the analysis. Instead,\nthey use mouse cells, as these can be\ngrown in quantity. In fact, they will\nkeep growing, even in a dish, as long\nas you feed them, and someone has\nto come in on weekends to keep them\nfed and separate their overcrowded\ncolonies.\nEven with this prodigious volume\nof cells, the samples analysed by the\nQ-TOF spectrometer are of low con-centration, and there is a high risk of\ncontamination with keratin \u2013 human\nskin or hair cells from the researchers\nin the lab, or even animal cells. \u201cNo\nwoollen clothing is allowed,\u201d says Wait.\n\u201cYou have to make sure that background levels are below what you are\ninterested in.\u201d\nPeirce laughs, \u201cRobin spends most\nof his time analysing my dandruff.\u201d A\nhair-raising prospect indeed.\nFlora Graham\nMy favourite fn machine: fragging peptides at the Kennedy Institute\nThe Q-TOF mass spectrometer is ideal for those with a penchant for shiny bits of kit. \u00a3300,000 ono\nBit of a head-scratcher \u2013 if you\u2019re not stringent about contamination,\nyou could end up analysing dandruff rather than mouse cell peptides\n\n"

Wonderful Wizards not included\nT\nully, Tully Makker. One\ncannot but love her for\nwho she is. Tough, passionate and ready to face\nlife in every way. She is\nan amazing character who has you\nrooting for her till the end, you would\nalways be there at her beck and call.\nThis stunning read is certainly a rollercoaster ride, you\u2019ll have your heart\nwrung many times over, but there is\ndefinitely hope at the end of the tun-nel, as they say. Love, friendship and\nloss are inherently entangled in this\nmaelstrom of a book. An absolute\nsensation. There are moments where\none finds oneself totally immersed in\nthe tragedy involving Jennifer that one\nwonders whether there is any future\nat all for Tully. Prepare to have your\nheart ripped to pieces and flung to all\ncorners of the earth with Tully\u2019s emotional odyssey. Frankly, this is one for\nthe girls, thrilling blockbuster stuff.\nThere are so many twists and turns in\nthe novel that will keep you ploughing\nto the denouement.\nSimply, this whirlwind novel is set\nin Kansas City, America. It is centrally\nbased on Tully Makker, a real tough\ncookie, who seemingly conquers all\nthe skeletons and demons in her clos-ets. She stands tall admist the trauma\nand chaos that harsh life has thrown at\nher. Simons truly brings Tully to life.\nThe way Simons portrays the main\nprotagonist\u2019s growth into womanhood\nfrom profoundly pained childhood and\nthe perennial struggles to overcome a\nlegacy of physical and emotional abuse\nat the hands of her mother is no easy\nfeat. The book is spiced up with many\nclose-calls. Simons further delves into\nconsiderably complex issues like self-harm, suicide, abortion, and autism\nwhich provides further scope to the\nplot. There are certainly a compelling\narray of male protagonists in this mas-terpiece, with Robin DeMarco and Jack\nPendel being the main leads who serve\nas prominent love interests in her life.\nConsidering that \u2018Tully\u2019 was Simons\u2019\ndebut novel, one cannot but be impressed with such eloquence and beautiful characterization and narrative.\nAlthough this novel emerges with\nTully aged only seventeen, the full horror of her tormented, harrowing childhood is revealed intermittently as we\nhave to piece together glimpses of the\ndarkness hidden within her past. It is\nnot till the denouement in which the\nfinal picture surfaces, when we fully\nunderstand the character as a whole\nfor who she really is.\nTully is very much a multidimensional character, difficult to decipher as she\nostensibly tries to proetct her innerself\nas a means of survival; an unwavering\ncoping mechanism. Abandoned by her\nfather,neglected,unlovedfrombirthby\nher mother, she is raised up in troubled\nhousehold, where she is both physically and mentally abused. However,\nby her teenage years, Tully manages to\nform strong bonds of friendship with\ntwo school friends whose backgrounds\nare totally different from her own. In\ngreat contrast, Jennifer and Julie come\nfrom loving families that provide so\nmuch warmth and joy that one cannot\nbut feel deeply ache for Tully and her\ndeplorable maltreatment.\nImmediately, we as the reader discover that Tully has been raised in an\natmosphere of indifference and neglect\ncompounded by the physical violence\ninflicted by her mother, Hedda, who\nwas herself the product of an unloving\nfamily.\n\u2018From the time Tully was two, she\nlearned fear, and with fear she learned\nhate, and with hate she learned silence.\u2019\nSimons writes with sheer poignancy\nand builds characters so effortlessly\nusing beautiful usage of language. Incredibly, Simons paints such a convincing and believable character; one\nwho manifests foibles just like the rest\nof us. A significant confirmation of her\nliterary talents. A true testament to the\nbook\u2019s credible realism.\nClandestine, promiscuous, highly\ncomplex and cantankerous Tully may\nbe, however, she also displays intense\nloyalty towards her friends, has an\ninherent sense of morality and an\noverwhelming capacity to love. Her\ntoughness is entirely superficial and\nis assumed as a protection against being irrevocably hurt again. Evading any\nsort of commitment and pity endowed,\nTully often masquerades her true\nemotions, and generally holds herself\nat arms length from boyfriends as a\nmeans of maintaining some illusion of\nanonymity. She drifts into relationships\nunable to fully commit to anyone, but\nis loved by all the men in her life. \u201cAll\nthey want to do is get serious, and all I\nwant to do is get the hell out of here.\u201d\nTo take control over the reigns of her\ndemons, Tully simply cages them in-side, leaving what she believes as to be\nan empty shell with nothing but a black\nhole within. Such observations are the\nclosest Tully ever gets to evident manifestations of self-pity. She is strong in\nspite of all the trials and tribulations,\nwe cannot admire her enough for the\ncourage and resilience she demonstrates in times of intense crisis. Without a doubt, we can surely understand\nher flaws as the inevitable conditioning\nof her unhappy, broken childhood. In\nfact, her remarkable resilience does\nshines through when on several different occasions, we find Tully joking\ncasaully about her dire situation. What\nis more, the apt touches of humour\nwhich Tully seems to evoke are unas-sailably the recognisable consequences\nof her inner strength, not succumbing\nto defeat, nor buckling under the sheer\nweight of her problems.\nThere is an underlying sinister and\ndark side to the whole story. The ongoing emotional and physical abuse\nderived from her mother, combined\nwith traumatic memories from her\nchildhood has meant that Tully continually suffers recurring nightmares\nin which she \u2018beats back death\u2019 every\nnight. These nightmares are something\nwhich torments Tully, day on day. This\nis until she finds salvation and becomes\n\u2018dreamfree.\u2019\nTully has never left Kansas her birth\nplace, never glimpsed the ocean but\nshe dreams of escaping her inauspicious gruelling life by going to university in California with her bestfriend\nJennifer, but her world is turned inside\nout. Life has other plans in store for\nher. Tully yet again has to endure cruel\nloss but against all odds, emerges into\nadulthood and seemingly reach a point\nof apparent calmness and contented-ness. Her life seems to evolve through\nchance rather than choice, until fate\ntakes another startling turn and unwelcome decisions are enthrusted upon\nher. Falling head and heels in love for\nthe first time whilst having finally settled with the man who has guided her\nthrough thick and thin, Tully reaches\nepiphany and has to make the toughest\ndecision of all\u2026\nOne should not feel ashamed of\nclinging onto one\u2019s Kleenexes whilst\nreading this heart wrenching, devas-tatingly absorbing novel. Indeed, if you\nread the entire book without any signs\nof a clenched throat or brimming eyes,\nI\u2019d be very surprised, you would definitely have to be a total dispassionate,\nemotional fuckwit.\nThe magic with this novel is that\nwhen you read it, you BECOME Tully.\nHer life is your life, her pain and happiness is yours to keep forever. I defy\nyou to read it and not be profoundly\naffected. You will certainly be gripped\nas you simply cannot put it down.

For in-stance, acrylic Adidas shellsuits evoke\npram-face, Eastenders, and Benson &\nHedges cigarettes. Judgemental and\nsuperficial? Probably, but still true.\nFashion synesthesia affects more\nthan just clothing. It\u2019s more easily observed by the way children\u2019s names fall\nin and out of style. Would you call your\nkid Chantelle? Generally the trends\nstart with ABC1s and fall to C2DEs.\nNames are inspirational, and parents\nchoose names that convey positive\nqualities. Of course you could opt out\nof this \u2018names-arms\u2019 race and choose\nsomething like Ethel.\nThis used to be more clear-cut with\nclothing in days gone by. Fashion was\nabout the latest couture from Paris.\nThe latest Parisian designs were worn\nby high society. People then had their\ntailors copy these Parisian designs.\nThen fashion became cheaper and\nmore accessible but was still dictated\nby the catwalk.\nNowadays we see that the trend is\nreversed, people on the streets set the\ntrends that are copied by designers.\nInspiration comes from all over the\nglobe, and style is less easily bought.\nMoney doesn\u2019t guarantee style, in fact\nsometimes it guarantees the exact op-posite. Who wants to wear clothes designed by an octogenarian who\u2019s dressing 14-year old models?\nFashion is created on the streets by\npeople who have an odd, uncompromising sense of style. Truly creative\npeople, not \u201ccrazy\u201d fashion students\nwho are engaged in a mass competition to out-crazy each other. Puh-lease.\nMassive glasses, a cape, and tissue\nboxes for shoes? Inspiring, although\nmissing leggings, with one leg a different colour than the other of course, so\nas not to be part of the masses. I don\u2019t\nmean a contrived type of insanity. I\nmean those curious animals on the\nedges of culture who possess a unique\ncreativity.\nNext along the chain are those who\nsee the potential in the fashion craziness and edit it for mass consumption.\nThey take the massive, googly geek\nglasses, which by the way look awe-some, and go for the tamer look of\nthick black frames.\nThen the look filters down to the\nmainstream- available in shops and\nmarket stalls near you.\nOf course trends aren\u2019t just made; like\neverything, they must die too. Remember guys, the spectre of death is always\non the horizon and one day you won\u2019t\nbe able to outrun it. Once something\nis linked to something undesirable\n(not in a Mengele way) certain items\njust loose their shine. Did you like Ugg\nboots? How about after Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton were \u2018papped\u2019\nwearing them? A fan of Gucci? A fan of\nGucci after Victoria Beckham declared\nher allegiance to them?\nThings can also lose their attraction just by being replaced by the next\ngeneration. Stone-washed boot-legged\njeans = Middle-aged woman in stilettos who wears leopard-print tops without irony.\nHaving no fashion sense (not voluntarily choosing not to participate in the\nwhole business because it\u2019s superficial\nand meaningless, I mean actually not\nhaving \u2018fashion-eyes\u2019) is an inability to\nsee these sort of fashion connections\nand associations. Yes, it\u2019s an awful dis-ease. Not up there with AIDs, but still\npretty bad. It causes untold damage,\nscarring the visual landscape. Have\nyou ever seen someone\u2019s outfit and\nthought to yourself, does this person\nhave eyes? But you have to remember\nthat however much it hurts your retinas to look directly at them, fashion illiteracy is not something they brought\nupon themselves. They don\u2019t get the\npleasure of appreciating well crafted\npersonal style, they have no fashion-gasms. This morning I saw a girl crossing the road wearing a mostly neutral\noutfit but with red bright tights and\nshoes; the visual effect was so stun-ning. I had to tell myself to stop staring because sometimes if you stare at\na girl\u2019s legs they get the wrong impression and think you\u2019re a lesbian.\nAlthough maybe fashion illiterates\nare actually the lucky ones. They don\u2019t\nget the downside of fashion; feeling\ncompelled to change your wardrobe\nwhen struck by a new look. Was it\nwrong to eat my sister\u2019s food because I\nblew my clothes budget? I joke. I don\u2019t\nhave a clothes budget. But it does strike\nany sane person as ridiculous to stop\nwearing a perfectly good pair of jeans\nor sweater because it doesn\u2019t take your\nfancy anymore. It\u2019s probably really aw-ful, capitalist and superficial. But if you\ngive them to charity it\u2019s a fact that all of\nthat bad stuff is cancelled out!\nFashion will inevitably become obso-lete, dragged down by time, d-list celebrities or the regular chav. But if you\nshop at charity shops in the right areas\nyour fashion obsession can be fuelled\nby fellow fashion addicts who have\nmore money and clothes to donate! All\nwhilst giving to charity! Win-win.\nCOOL\nFashion is a fickle business, what\u2019s in one day is tainted by Victoria Beckham the next\nLAME\nPearlised Rainbow pump (Chanel), Neoprene and Napa leather tote bag (Pierre Hardy), knotted pearl choker with jewel detail (John Galliano)\nObjects of desire\nSarah Skeete\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 16 November 2007 felix\nPolitics\nSegregation often starts in Britain\u2019s schools\nI\nt\u2019s fair to say that the politics\nsection has been pretty much\ndevoid of national stories. We\u2019ve\nhad a look at the situation in\nIran, Pakistan and Russia and\nfound that things aren\u2019t fantastic. But\nwhat\u2019s been going on in the UK this last\nmonth? Now that we\u2019re back I think it\u2019s\ntime to cast an eye over, what I believe\nto be, the most important topic in 21st\ncentury Britain. I\u2019m talking about mul-ticulturalism, what does it mean, is it\ngood or bad and what\u2019s the future of\nmulticulturalism as we move further\ninto this new century?\nBefore we investigate the issue of\nmulticulturalism, we must first be sure\nabout what we\u2019re talking about. The\nbest way of defining this word is to use\nit as an adjective; a multicultural state\nis one in which people from different\ncultural backgrounds live together\nand maintain a healthy dialogue which\naverts tension. It is a state where people do not live in isolated communities\nand they share common ground for\ninstance language. I should perhaps be\nmore precise; I have defined here what\nmulticulturalism is when it works,\nwhen it plays a positive role in soci-ety. On the other hand I might look at\nmulticulturalism when it is damaging.\nHere we have a society where people\nfrom different cultural backgrounds\nlive in isolated communities. There\nis mistrust that is fuelled by racism\nand suspicions of racism, a perceived\ntheft of national identity and language\nbarriers.\nNow that we\u2019ve identified what we\nare talking about, suddenly the question of whether multiculturalism is\ngood or bad is less relevant. It is obvious that it can be good or bad and a\nmore important question is what kind\nof multiculturalism do we have today\nin Britain? If we restrict our vision and\nregard Imperial as a sort of multicultural society then it is clear that it is\ngood multiculturalism. People from\ndifferent cultural backgrounds mix, associate and certainly do live together.\nWe benefit from meeting people from\ndifferent cultural backgrounds and\nlearning from them.\nNow if we expand our vision, we do\nnot find the same to be the case when\nlooking at the UK in general. All over\nthe country communities are increasingly divided by race and religion. But\nthis point isn\u2019t exactly a revelation and\nneither is it necessarily harmful to\nsociety in general. In London 25% of\nresidents live in religiously segregated\nareas according to a study by the University of East London.\n\u201cWe found that a level of segregation actually seems to improve the lot\nof people living in areas that are segregated along religious self-identity\nlines,\u201d said the author, Professor Allan\nBrimicombe.\nIn the short term then some groups\ndo in fact benefit from this segregation;\nhowever the findings indicated Muslims were more likely to be \u201ctrapped\u201d\nin deprived areas and less likely to\nforge links with other groups living\naround them.\nDespite this report, in the long-term,\nsegregation contributes to the ill health\nof society and as a result multiculturalism becomes a destructive force rather than what it should be; a positive\nforce. Evidence of this segregation is all\naround us; education and housing has\nbecome intensely divided.\nFor example, In Blackburn, there are\nmany overwhelmingly white schools -St Bede\u2019s Roman Catholic High (96.3\nper cent white). The segregation is\nmatched on the other side of the racial divide. At Beardwood High, 94.5\nper cent of pupils are Asian. Only one\nschool in the borough reflects the ethnic breakdown of a community whose\npopulation is 70.5 per cent white and\n26.5 percent Asian. This lack of contact between communities from the\nbeginning of a person\u2019s life means\nthat division and discrimination is\nthe norm from an early age. Separate\ncommunities are growing up alongside each other with little or any common point of reference. This is only\none example of segregation, there are\nmany more particularly in housing\nbut what is important is that it is this\nkind of de facto segregation \u2013 which\nwas and still is present in the U.S. with\nregards to black people \u2013 that dooms\nmulticulturalism.\nPeople of British origin fall into the\ntrap of xenophobia as a result of this\nsegregation, Parts of towns which 20\nyears ago had white residents now are\ninhabited by persons with different\nskin colour and culture, and this causes\nresentment. There is a sense that their\nnational identity is under attack by foreigners who are not willing to embrace\nEnglish-speaking culture. Add to this\nmixture the unique occurrence of international terrorism in the 21st century then it hard to see the positives of\nmulticulturalism.\nIf we turn this around then we find\npretty much the same situation. Immigrants feel that they are coming into a\nsociety that is hostile to them. Therefore they are pushed and pulled into\nsegregated communities, which acts\nonlytoincreasesuspicionandmistrust.\nThrough segregated schooling this\nmindset is reinforced. In particular the\nMuslim community experiences this\nas a result of the foreign policy of the\nUK, the radicalization of disaffected\nyouths and the politicization of Islam.\nHostility towards the police and other\nofficial institutions is always a signal\nof societal ill-health and certainly this\nis true of certain parts of the Muslim\ncommunity living in Britain today.\nThe question that inevitably leads\nfrom this conclusion of the state of\nmulticulturalism in Britain today is\nwhose fault is it? How have we found\nourselves in this regretful situation?\nThere are two paths that lead to a divided society, one is discrimination by\nthe dominant group within society and\nthe other is the lack of a unifying thread\nconnecting all those within society. By\ndiscrimination I mean in this case, racism against ethnic minorities and a\nlack of tolerance towards other faiths.\nCertainly this exists in Britain today.\nIslamophobia is disguised as concern\nfor national security and the battle\nagainst \u2018political correctness\u2019 often descends into Daily Mail style intolerance\nin the name of \u2018common sense\u2019.\nHowever this is not the reason why\nBritish society is increasingly divided.\nIt is only a reaction to it. The absence\nof a unifying thread running through\nsociety is in fact the real reason why we\nare so separated. I should be clear what\nI mean when I say a \u2018unifying thread\u2019.\nI mean something that connects all of\nus, something substantial. Language\nis an obvious thread that connects us\nbut it is not strong enough to hold together a divided society that increasingly speaks many different languages.\nA strong British identity is notoriously\nabsent today; ask a person what it\nmeans to be British they will most likely reply with an apathetic grunt.\nKadhim Shubber comments on multicultural Britain; a cohesive society or just segregation?\nImmigration and multiculturalism\nImmigrants to this country often come from proud cultural back-grounds, how can we ask them to engage and integrate into a culture whose\ngreatest achievements are Harry Potter\nand chips? There\u2019s a reason why many\nimmigrants consider being British as a\nsecondary identity and it\u2019s because of\nthis one question, what am I linking\nmyself with when I say I\u2019m British? Is\nit a nation that is proud of its history\nor one that regularly puts the sensibilities of other cultures in front of it\u2019s\nlong-standing traditions, am I part of\na prestigious club or a country where\nthe question \u201cWhat do you do if you\nspill someone\u2019s pint in a pub\u201d appears\non the citizenship test; unfortunately\nthe answer to both these questions are\nthe latter.\nWe have over-accommodated other\ncultures at the expense of our own\nand the result has not been a society\nwhere lots of different peoples live in\nharmony. Instead we live in a divided\ncountry, where different cultures live\nin isolation. This isolation will only\ngrow worse generation by genera-tion. We must act now and encourage\ndialogue between communities. We\nmust act to desegregate schooling and\nfight discrimination within national\ninstitutions.\nWe must fight the poverty that traps\ncertain ethnic and religious groups at\nthe bottom of society and most importantly we must lead by example\nand show other cultures that we are\nproud of our heritage, our history and\nour traditions. Only then will we work\ntowards a unified society where people\nof all cultures and ethnic backgrounds\nwill say with pride \u2018I am British\u2019.\nThe Nottinghill Carnival celebrates the diversity of culture in the UK\nThe Union Jack has long been the symbol of Britishness\n\u201cAt Beardwood\nHigh, 94.5\npercent of pupils\nare Asian\u201d\n\n"

At\ncounty level, I have had 2 caps for\nCornwall, whilst at a national level,\nI have represented Scotland at U16\nand U18, captaining the side three\ntimes. I have also taken part in the\nU17 and U20 World Championships\nand have also competed in the Commonwealth Games.\nAchievements:\nAt county level I became Cornwall\nSabre Champion in 2006, whilst at\na national level I have been ranked\n1st in Great Britain at U17 and U20\nlevels in 2001/02. At the Commonwealth Games, we won the Team\nSilver Medal and in 2006 I became\nBUSA Women\u2019s Foil Champion and\nIDEA League Winner for the team\nevent.\nAspirations:\nTo win a Commonwealth gold med-al, consistently win the big British\ncompetitions and to win the BUSA\nPremier League with Imperial\nBUSA:\nBeing a part of the Imperial team\nthat got promoted to the Premier\nLeague last year was absolutely bril-liant. We were undefeated in the SE\nConference and lost out narrowly to\nCambridge in the Cup competition.\nThis year we have ambitions to make\na mark in our new league and ensure\nthat we remain there for next year.\nTo round off a successful season, we\njoined forces with the men\u2019s team to\ntake on universities in Europe in the\nIDEA league and were the winners\nof the tournament.\nSportsman Spotlight\nHannah Bryars \u2013 Fencing\nNews in brief\nTennis Men\u2019s 2nd\nBest loss ever for Men\u2019s 1st!\nI\u2019d like to start by saying that this was\nprobably the most satisfactory defeat\nwe\u2019ll have, if such a thing exists. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong, we\u2019re disappointed to\nhave lost but sometimes you just have\nto admit that the other team was better\n(or half of their team was better, in this\ncase). UCL, a team who we narrowly\nlost to, were \u2018spanked\u2019 15-2 by London\nMet in the opening week, so we knew\nwe were going to have a tough night.\nDaniel Andersson was drafted in to an\nalready strong Imperial team consisting of Wei Lun, Kevin and Gaetan. Our\nopponents boasted a Number 1 and\n2 pairing of Zhi Tao Jiang and Hong\nMing Zhang. The former plays for the\ntop team in the British Premier League,\nand according to the IC players who\nplayed, the latter is better than him. So\nyeah, they\u2019re good.\nIncidentally I was umpiring some of\nthe Girls\u2019 matches against Middlesex\nat the time, which is something you\nnaturally look forward to. Indeed, I noticed fellow IC Table Tennis member/\nspectator, Jerry, rush over at the first\nopportunity to umpire Anusha\u2019s match\nwith Egle Adomelyte of Middlesex\u2026\neven though they were already 3 sets\nin. But I found myself getting more distracted by the play from London Met\u2019s\nChinese duo on the other tables \u2013 and\nthat\u2019s saying a lot. They came, played 9\ngames between them (including a dou-bles) without dropping a set, and left.\nThey\u2019re completely out of our league\n(we\u2019ll leave England\u2019s top players to\nhandle them in the future, although\nTable Tennis\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 6\nLondon Met. Men\u2019s 1st 11\nMichael Sathyendran\neven they would probably struggle) and\nthey single-handedly won the game for\ntheir team.\nHowever, when they were gone, the\n\u201ccompetitive\u201d match got going. Gaetan\nwon Imperial\u2019s first sets of the day (!)\nbut it was not enough, as he lost an absorbing encounter with Sampson Reid,\ngoing down 11-8 in the final set. Wei\nLun also lost out to Sampson (3-1), but\nat one stage looked to be taking the\ngame into a decider, only to fall 11-9\nin the 4th. Kevin had fewer problems\nwith him though, to record a 3-1 vic-tory. Mert Kirteler proved a much\neasier assignment for the IC players\nas all beat him comfortably in straight\nsets. The last match of the night was\nbetween Daniel and Sampson. Daniel\ngot off to a flying start taking the first\ntwo sets with much ease but possibly\ndue to a lack of concentration, was\npegged back to 2-2. It is important to\nregain your composure in these situa-tions, especially when your opponent\nis growing in confidence and picking\nup a head of steam. In fact, I think\nSampson was even growling between\nwinning points! Yes, that\u2019s right, making audible growling sounds, much to\nthe amusement (and bemusement) of\nthose watching. He seems very tame\noff the court, though, I can assure you.\nDaniel took little notice of this and\nwent back to the kind of play that gave\nhim the lead, dominating rallies close\nto the table and again taking the set\ncomfortably to win 3-2.\nIt was a nice end to a difficult match.\nIt would have been easy to get disheartened when staring down a 9-0\ndeficit with the match already lost, but\nwe showed great determination to take\n6 of the next 8 rubbers. As long as they\nkeep the same team, no one will get\nclose to London Met this season, and\nfew will manage to take 6 games off\nthem. We can take many positives out\nof this match and look forward to what\nwill hopefully be a successful season!\nSmash\nThe MCC have set Imperial College\nscientists the task of making new\ncricket balls pink over the coming\nwinter. The reasoning behind this\nis that pink is better to spot than\nthe traditional red ball during day\nmatches, as well as easier to see than\nthe white balls for night games. It\nis suggested that the pink balls will\ngive the batsman an extra fraction\nof a second to spot the ball, however\nbowlers will probably be thinking\nthat this takes the edge away from\ntheir bowling.\nApparently, the challenge with the\nNew pink cricket balls\ncricket balls is for them to retain\ntheir colour after being whacked several times. It is this that the scientists\nwill be working on, more specifically\nfiguring out a way to impregnate the\nball with the colour and then stopping the grass discolouring it.\nTo begin with, the ball will be used\nat university level and second XI\nmatches at the start of next season.\nThe eventual aim is for the balls to\nbe used in Twenty-20 matches and\nthen one-day internationals.\nPreviously, orange balls were considered but they were hard to see on\ntelevision. Hopefully the pink one\nwill be better for both the teams and\nthe television.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nJon Downing\nMiner socs go paintballing\nIn it\u2019s second year, the annual paint-balling competition between Materials and Geology is quickly becoming a\ntradition. Four geologists and a token\nphysicist joined 25 material scientists\nat 7.30am in the union. A disappointing turn out amongst Geology was\nmainly driven by a mass field trip the\nfollowing weekend. This prompted\nSteph, the De La Beche President, to\nproclaim that they would have lost the\nmatch anyway.\nWith the teams being pre-decided by\nPost, who listed everyone he wanted to\nshoot in one column and everyone he\ndidn\u2019t mind hitting in crossfire in the\nother column, we boarded our coach to\nCroydon. Upon arrival we donned our\ncamo gear, face masks and helmets and\nproceeded to wage war. In one corner,\nthe white team crowded behind green\nmeshing, in the other the blue team\nhauled up on the ramparts of a wooden castle. Blows were exchanged; I was\nshot in the face. A subsequent sound\non the whistle stopped the game showing a triumphant white player, flag in\nhand. Defend and then attack- our\nturn. I quickly realised how little accuracy paintball guns have. It\u2019s a matter-of-the-numbers game \u2013 get close and\nhope one shot finds its target. Having\nbeen shot out before time again, our\nteam knew we were up against an experienced foe, especially Kevin who\ndeemed himself good enough to paintball in a T-shirt.\nThe next round was speedball, a\nsmall, manic area \u2013 where we again\ngot trashed. The third stage inventively\ncalled barrels, allowed some more tactical play by the blues, who eventually got some FIT points! That\u2019s FlagIn-Transit, not Fitty-In-Team as one\nmight expect.\nLunch was provided by Pizza Hut\nwho, it seems, make the best margherita pizzas ever. The hungry students\nquickly finished off 15 or so in order to\nmake it out for the last two stages of\nthe day, village and bunker. The white\nteam performed well in the village and\nmanaged to increase their point mar-gin. Good use of smoke grenades in\nthe bunker stage gave sufficient cover\nfor both teams to grab the flag in their\nattempts.\nA grand-prix-esque celebration featuring a magnum of champagne was\nthrown for the winning team. This\nconfused pseudo-fresher Borja, thinking that the alcohol was for consum-ing, he tried to neck it before being\nreminded that it was for spraying. The\nbest bruise went to Chumley but on\nlater inspection, probably should have\nbeen awarded to Hanyan for the huge\none on her arm. An awesome trip,\nthanks to everyone for coming.\nOverall a win for Materials! Better\nluck next time Geology!\nSplat! (I couldn\u2019t fill the whole page so I had to use a random picture!)\n\n"

While\nthe exceptional performance was a\nrenewed source of pride for Imperial,\ndoubts have been cast by students as\nwell as faculty across the board on the\naccuracy of the league table produced,\nwith obvious misalignments such as\nthe University of Hong Kong being\nrated higher than Stanford University\nand University College London placed\nthirteen spots above research giant\nUniversity of California at Berkeley.\nThe THES ranking, started since\n2004 by education and careers company Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), ranks\nuniversities in the globe by criteria\nsuch as the opinions of academics and\nemployers, citation count of its faculty,\nthe make up of international students\nand staff as well as the ratio of staff to\nstudents, which is used as a rough metric to measure the quality of teaching\nin universities. This year witnessed a\nmajor reshuffling in THES due to the\nimplementation of Z-scores \u2013 measuring the amount of deviation from\nthe average instead of using absolute\nscores as were for previous years \u2013 and\nthis had the effect of preventing singular exceptionally good performers\nfrom depressing scores of all other institutions in that measure, such as LSE\nfor \u201cinternational students\u201d.\nA huge distinguishing factor of THES\nfrom another frequently cited ranking,\nthe Academic Ranking of World University produced by the Shanghai Jiaotong University in China, is the number\nof non-American schools making to\nthe top echelons of the table. While the\nShanghai Jiaotong, which was cited by\nEconomist, focuses on solid indicators\nsuch as citation count and Nobel priz-es, the peer-review system remained\ncentral to the methodology of THES.\nOf questionable validity is the way\n\u201cpeer review\u201d was conducted. Of the\n190,000 academics that were emailed\na request to complete their online survey last year, only 1,600 responded,\nwhich represented a response rate of\nan astonishingly low 0.8%.\nTo add to the woes for peer review, a\ndetailed inspection of the overall ranking saw 7th ranked Caltech and 19th\nranked Stanford University as the only\ntwo universities in the table of top 200\nto be assigned a perfect citation per\nfaculty score of 100, while Imperial,\nwhich came in 5th, scored an unenviable 81.\nSimilarly, the tables for individual\ndisciplines, such as Natural Sciences,\nBiomedicine, Technology, Social Science and Arts and Humanities, also\nsaw huge discrepancies between peer\nreview scores and citation count. In\ngeneral, American universities are\ngraded far more harshly by peer-reviewers than their citations might\nsuggest. For example, in the table for\nBiomedicine, while the National University of Singapore is placed at the\n12th spot above California Institute\nof Technology at 23rd place, its citation count is a mere 4.4, a far-cry from\nCaltech\u2019s 10.4, which incidentally, is\nonly second to MIT\u2019s 11.3 (9th place).\nSuch glaring gulf between peer review\nscores and the actual citation measured\ncast huge doubt to the validity of the\nwhole peer review system, which is the\nbackbone of THES. One cannot help\nthinking why international academics\nwould like to cite American researchers so profusely while at the same time\nrefuse to vote for them with zeal.\nThe standard of checking data and\ninformation is also dubious. Last year,\nCNNMoney/Fortune published a top\nMBA ranking by QS, only to withdraw\nit hastily and embarrassingly after revelations that the ranking did not distinguish between North Carolina State\nUniversity and the more esteemed\nKenan-Flagler Business School of the\nUniversity of North Carolina. In addi-tion, until recently, the THES famously\nmisspelled University of Peking as\nUniversity of Beijing for three years in\na row.\nAmongst other controversial measures used by THES is how the percentage of international students in a university has to do with its actual quality.\nWhile the THES believes that the ability to attract foreign students reflects\na university\u2019s quality, it is known that\nsome uncompetitive universities in\nAustralia, for example, have an open\ndoor admission policy to foreign students which accept basically school-dropouts and come packaged with a\nfoundation course in addition to the\ndegree programme. In such case, foreign students are only viewed as cash\ncows, not a hallmark of academic ex-cellence. In addition, elite private universities in the United States are known\nto cap their international admission to\nroughly 7% and public ones at 2%. The\ncriteria of measuring the presence of\ninternational students look biased if\nthese policies are implemented.\nSupporters of THES are likely to\nhighlight that weighing universities\nmerely by means of citation and Nobel Prizes alone are likely to be inac-curate. For one, there is the likelihood\nof American researchers citing each\nother, and with the number of US uni-versities, the American schools are\nlikely to enjoy an unfair advantage\nover their competitors. However, well\nendowed schools are likely to attract\nthe best academics and fund meaningful research, and with American giants\nlike Princeton owning an endowment\nWORLD\nUNIVERSITY\nRANKINGS\nNOVEMBER 9 2007\nCollege has lapped up news of its jump to fifth. The Rector (or one of\nhis minions) even sent out a congratulatory email to everyone\nThe cover of the guide that places Imperial five spots higher than MIT\nTHES\nProduced by Shanghai\n\u2022\nJiaotong University in China\nHas a noted science bias\n\u2022\nCited by the Economist\n\u2022\nmagazine\nCitation index and Nobel\n\u2022\nPrize central to ranking\nRanks Cambridge 4\n\u2022 th\nand\nPeking outside of the top\n200\nAmerican universities\n\u2022\noccupy 17 out of the top 20\nplaces\n07 06 University\n1 1 Harvard University\n2 2 University of Cambridge\n= 3 University of Oxford\n= 4= Yale University\n5 9 Imperial College, London\n6 10 Princeton University\n7 7 California Institute of Technology\n= 11 Univeristy of Chicago\n9 25 University College, London\n10 4= Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nTHES University World Rankings\nThe THES vx.

Oxbridge and\nLondon colleges have been edging up\nthe table year on year in THES. While\nthere may be real improvement in actual quality, moving up nine places\n(Imperial) in the window of 3 years is\nhighly dubious and represents more\nof a change in ranking methodologies\nthan anything else. In the employer\nreview section, the University of Manchester is ranked higher by employers\nthan Stanford, Princeton and MIT,\nwhich leads to the obvious suggestion\nof a steep British bias. Although the\nTHES enjoyed extensive reporting by\nBritish as well as newspapers in Commonwealth countries like Singapore,\nMalaysia and India, it was hardly\nnoticed by newspapers across the\nAtlantic.\nWhile the efforts taken to compile a\ntrue and fair table for students should\nbe applauded, it is unlikely that the\nessence of any university can be encapsulated merely by statistics on a ta-ble. Nevertheless, we can only expect\nleague tables to continue to be part of\nthe educational reality.\nYou can see the complete THES\nWorld Ranking 2007 online at\nwww.thes.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 16 November 2007 felix\nGames\nHalo\u2013 its mix of varied, excellent weap-ons, the range of devastating and agile\nvehicles you can use and hijack, the\nwell-structured maps, the intra-team\ncompetition, and most of all, those revered headshots \u2013 is unprecedented.\nAs Bungie once mentioned in an in-terview, \u201canything can happen in the\nmultiplayer.\u201d It certainly seems so, and\nwith the movie and screenshot functions implemented into the game, you\ncan keep reminding your mates just\nhow badly you beat them. One picture\nspeaks a thousand ownages. So your\nmate really insists that bullet never hit\nhim, and that somehow the game is\ncheating him? Find the movie of that\nmatch, follow the path of the bullet and\nwatch in super-slow-motion as it cuts\nthrough his helmet. Then take a picture and send it to him.\nRising through the ranks rapidly\nsince September, I\u2019ve taken as many\nscreenshots (read: photographs) as I\ntake in real life \u2013 in other words, a vast\namount \u2013 and you can always show\nthem to your mates afterwards and\nremember just how lucky you were to\nmiss that Spartan Laser, or just how\nunlucky they were to get stuck by a\nplasma grenade. You could have been\nthe gunner on a warthog involved in\npicked up my sniper rifle and gave his\ncranium some extra ventilation. By the\nend of the match, he was huffing and\npuffing, attempting to blow my house\ndown but to no avail. He decided a few\nmore snide comments would suffice,\nbefore leaving mid-insult.\nI gradually but steadily gained my\nexperience points, and it wasn\u2019t long\nbefore another aspect of this multiplayer\u2019s addictiveness came hurtling\nback at me. As in Halo 2, you can earn\nmedals for doing certain skilful things\nin online matches, and of course the\nfinal instalment in the trilogy is no ex-ception. The thing is, there are now far\nmore medals to get, and some at first\njust seem impossible. Nevertheless, I\nkept trying, as does everyone else, to\nget those sought-after virtual honours.\nMy first Sniper Spree was my online\navatar\u2019s equivalent of a baby learning\nhow to walk. I was so proud.\nEventually you will encounter someone online who outranks you beyond\nbelief. For example, when I was eventually promoted to a Lieutenant \u2013 thereby making you a \u201cveteran\u201d, according\nto the game \u2013 the first match I entered\ninto afterwards happened to contain a\nBrigadier, which is the second highest\nrank possible. People actually sounded\na bit nervous upon inspecting his stats,\nand for good reason. Without going\ninto details, this guy single-handedly\nquadrupled my team\u2019s total score. A\none-man extermination; a massacre.\nSoon afterwards, another Brigadier\ncame up in a Big Team Slayer match.\nI was still a Lieutenant, and he was\nonce again on the other team. This, in\nmy opinion, was to be my poetic justice seen through. From the off, I had\nmy sights focused almost solely on this\npersonification of pure evil.\nThis particular match \u2013 VIP \u2013 was\na new type not seen in the prequel,\nwith the objective being to terminate\nthe opposing team\u2019s randomly selected\nleader. During the match, I happened\nto be driving a Warthog with two other\nSpartans in tow. Skidding around the\nsand, slipping just past those rockets\nand evading the rifle fire, we made it\nacross to a hill where several hostiles\nhad congregated around their VIP. Several of them leapt into a Mongoose \u2013 a\nvery agile, small transport \u2013 and their\nVIP leapt onto the back of another. We\ngave chase, our turret man took out all\nbut the VIP, and just as he was getting\naway, he was hit in the back of the head\nby my very own sniper rifle. He also\nhappened to be the Brigadier.\nSound exciting, no? Big surprise.\nHalo 3 has ranks, stats, and awards, but\nreally, at its very core, it is all about the\npure adrenaline rush you get whenever\nyou play a match of any kind. The kind\nof experience you get upon playing\nthe Great Flag Run of Valhalla, or the\nsniper who provided vital cover fire on\nLast Resort. Maybe you were the one\nwho was at the front of the charge that\ntook that last Territory on Sandtrap.\nPerhaps you were the guy who happened to Spartan Laser that convoy of\nvehicles heading right towards you. Or\nyou could just have been the person\nwho got that shotgun spree on High\nGround.\nYou might even be involved in a mu-tiny. One particular match placed me\nalongside a horrifyingly annoying pair\nof gamers: the first was a whiney American twelve year old, who screeched\nfor help every time a bullet whizzed\npassed his head; the second was a\nmuch older, immature imbecile who,\ndespite only have one kill throughout\nthe entire match, continued to remind\neveryone else how rubbish the rest\nof the team apparently was. So we all\nsurrounded him and waited for him\nto lash out physically, thus giving us\nthe perfect excuse to gun him down.\nWe lost the match, but we all gained a\nmoral victory.\nMy point is that everything you do\non Halo 3\u2019s multiplayer is different,\nvaried and is a new, thrilling experience every time. Not only is it addic-tive, but it is incredibly enjoyable. It is\nessentially the same formula as in Halo\n2, but with some new gameplay addi-tions, new weapons, and some awesome new features. The small scale\nbattles are intense; the big team battles\nare epic- even more so than in 2.\nThere are some gameplay differences\nto note: people\u2019s weapons are now visible even if they aren\u2019t wielding them, so\nthat bastard hiding around the corner\nmay look like he just has a submachine\ngun, but he\u2019s concealing a shotgun too\n\u2013 it is attached to the holster on his\nback. You are also armed with Equipment now \u2013 anti-tank mines, health\nregenerator clouds, power drains, and\nbest of all, bubble shields: you can step\nin and out of them, but even if a tank\nis firing shells at you, nothing will ever\nget through the impenetrable sphere\nthis device creates.\nThere are more game types, including VIP, Shotty Snipers, and the fan-created-turned-officialInfectionmode,\nwheresword-wielding\u201czombies\u201dattack\nthe dwindling team of humans on large\nmaps. On some settings, the zombies\ncan run as fast as the Mongoose can\ndrive at top speeds, which is genuinely\nscary if you happen to be the last human remaining. As aforementioned,\nyou can get so many awards now it\u2019s\nridiculous. I have several Steaktacular\nAwards, a few Bulltrues, and a Hail to\nthe King. I\u2019ll leave you to discover what\nthese mean\u2026if you get them, that is.\nIt isn\u2019t often you can say a tank\nlanded on your head. With the game\u2019s\nForge mode, wherein you are able to\nedit everything on a map except the\ngeometry, it is fairly common mid-game to see explosive barrels raining\ndown from the sky, almost complete-ly-invisible sword-wielding Spartans\nleaping across the map, and even flying\nElephants.\nFor me, it is all about getting those\nnear-impossible kills. I\u2019m sure all you\nHalo fans out there will appreciate\nmid-air headshots, \u201cno-scopes\u201d (kill-ing someone with a sniper without\nzooming in), sticking a Banshee with a\nplasma grenade, and so forth. Plus, all\nthis has to be a great way to relieve aggression \u2013 you can blast those whiney\nbrats, mow down those foul-mouthed\nlosers, and beat down those that can\u2019t\nplay to save their lives. And hey, even if\nyou can\u2019t beat them, at least the game\nlets you quickly mute them!\nAnd so here I am today \u2013 a Commander, with over 7,000 recorded kills,\nwith 1/7th of those using a sniper ri-fle. There are people out there who are\nhigher ranked than I am, and others\nthat I could never hope to beat, but of\ncourse this will not stop me trying. In\nessence, Halo 3\u2019s multiplayer is about\ntwo things. Firstly, it is trying to better yourself \u2013 you will do anything,\nno matter what it takes, to be the very\nbest, and to gain that next promotion\nthat will lead people to actually show\nyou some respect for once. Secondly,\nit is, of course, about having a bloody\ngood time, and no game has ever come\nclose to providing his much entertain-ment. If you haven\u2019t already tried, get\nsome mates over, turn on your wireless\ncontrollers, and step into this amazing\nonline world.\nOh, and one last note. If you haven\u2019t\nfired a charged Plasma Pistol at a fleeing vehicle,\nyou haven\u2019t lived. That is\nall. See you online \u2013\nthat is, if I haven\u2019t\nscoped you first.\nErm guys... the match is over... you can stop trying to look cool now, okay?\nOn Live, the party never ends!\nAnd now a friendly message from the Master Chief: Remember kids, only you can prevent noobs from playing on Live. Embarrass them so badly that they don\u2019t log in. Ever again\n\u201cMy first Sniper\nSpree was my\nonline avatar\u2019s\nequivalent of a\nbaby learning\nhow to walk\u201d\n\u201cOne picture\nspeaks a\nthousand\nownages\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "As I have mentioned in previous weeks\nImperial College Union is supporting\nthe proposed changes to the NUS\nConstitution so that the organisation\ncan organise itself in a manner that is\nrelevant to coherent, more representative\npolicy making and sound financial\nmanagement. In order for these changes\nto pass this academic year almost 40\nUnions, including ours, have voted to\nrequest an Extraordinary Conference\nwhich is to be held on Tuesday 4\nDecember in Leicester.\nAt this point I would like to appeal to\nall of those students who voted for us\nto affiliate last year. As a result of your\ndecision the Union is now committed\nto paying NUS \u00a344,000 per annum in\naffiliation fees. In my view there is little\npoint in us paying this money if we\nare not going to have the opportunity\nto voice our opinion. This is why it is\nvital that we send a full delegation of\n9 people along to this conference so\nthat the Union is obtaining maximum\nvalue for money out of this ridiculous,\nclunking, socialist vehicle that we are\nnow working very hard to try and change\nby supporting the Governance Review.\nTravel and reasonable food expenses\nwill be provided by the Union. The\nExtraordinary Conference is a one day\nevent. Our delegation will leave (not\ntoo) early in the\nmorning and you\nwill be back in\nLondon by early\nevening. If you\nhave an interest in\nexactly how silly\nsome of the more\n\u201crevolutionary\u201d\ngroupings\ncurrently active\nwithin NUS are\nthen please drop\nme an email and I will add you to our\ndelegation. National student politics has\nalways been a pantomime and if you\nare interested in a day of what will be\nsome very heated debates regarding the\nGovernance Review please let me know\nby Wednesday lunchtime at the very\nlatest. You never know, you could end up\nspeaking at this event.\nModerate Unions will duly engage in an\nentire day of Trot bashing as the hard\nleft are insisting that this process is part\nof some secret right-wing conspiracy\nto hijack student democracy so I urge\nyou to come along so that we are in the\nbest position from which to articulate\nthe Union\u2019s point of view. I appreciate\nthat the prospect of a free trip to the\nMidlands is not the best offer you will\nreceive during your time at Imperial but it\nshould be an entertaining day.\nunionpage\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8060\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nNUS Extraordinary Conference\nSupport the Governance Review and get a free trip to Leicester!\nStephen Brown\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nHow did you do in your last set of exams?\nHas anyone given you a breakdown of how\nyou managed in each individual section?\nPresuming you didn\u2019t get 100% has anyone\ntold you where you went wrong?

It is disappointing\nthe newspaper of such a diverse student body failed to expressly criticise\nWatson\u2019s views or Watson himself. His\ncomments were only called controversial and unsupported by scientific\nevidence; I bet that he\u2019s cowering after\nthat verbal lashing.\nIn fact his comments are not con-troversial, well not among reasonable\nminded people. A controversy only\noccurs when people disagree about\nan issue, Jack Straw\u2019s comments about\nheadscarves were controversial because people disagreed about the is-sue. There has not been a debate about\nhis comments because there is no\nroom for one, he is both scientifically\nand ethically wrong. James Watson\nhas been widely and consistently criti-cised, apart from our own publication.\nHis history as an important scientist\nFelix failed\nto condemn\nDr Watson\u2019s\ncomments\nGilead Amit\nL\netters are powerful tools. In\nthe right hands, these insignificant little squiggles can\nconvey romance, suspense,\npassion, terror, and ridiculously over-employed clich\u00e9s. Yet there\nare times, when the power is handed\nover to those unable to wield it prop-erly, that they can generate confusion,\nrage and despair.\nI know that scientists are anti-hu-manists. I knew that before I came\nhere, but I never really came to grips\nwith the depth of the contrast. Let me\nmake my meaning plainer. I am writing this while recovering from several\nhours of staring at page upon page\nfilled with incomprehensible mark-ings. At least, they had some sort of\nsignificance when I first sat down, but\nthat disappeared very quickly. Those\nsame intrinsically worthless pen-marks that can produce emotions of\nthe purest kind when wielded by poets\nor authors, should never, ever, be used\nby physicists.\nYou would think that the letter \u2018g\u2019,\ninnocent as it is, had little chance of\nmaking my life a hell. When ensconced\nsafely in the word \u2018syzygy\u2019, or hiding\ncoyly in the word \u2018vestige\u2019 (both chosen\nby a large number of English speakers\nas among the most beautiful in our lan-guage), granted, it poses little threat.\nIt even has a special significance for\nme personally \u2013 an old acquaintance,\nif you will, as for obvious reasons it\nwas the first letter I ever had to learn\nto capitalize. And yet, despite its endearing characteristics, I now hate it.\nI loathe it. I detest and despise it with\nvehemence worthy of A. Geek. For it\nhas now come to symbolize gravitational acceleration, and that drives me\nquite simply berserk.\nThings aren\u2019t that bad, I hear you\nsay; look at all the other lovely letters\nour language has to offer. Not so \u2013 ac-celeration, speed of light, distance, ec-centricity, Planck\u2019s constant, impulse,\nmomentum, time and weight are all\nlurking in the shadows. Our alphabet\nreads like a wanted list of dangerous\nconvicts, escaped from their protective\nasylums and unleashed onto the world\nat large. Mainly, of course, to annoy\nme.\nWords have started to lose all sense;\ngarden looks eerily similar to g \u03b1 ren\n, vat\nbecomes v = u + at, while tag involves\nthe exact three variables (or symbols,\nfor those actually following) that have\nbeen chasing each other over my notes\nfor the last three hours, come to think\nof it, a game of tag. Trust me, that particular bad joke was unintentional.\nTo tell the truth, I feel my spirits lifting already. That\u2019s a relief \u2013 I can now\ngo back over this thing and proofread it\nwithout getting post-traumatic-stress-induced flashbacks. Of course, I know\nthat this is only a temporary respite.\nBecause, masochist that I am, I am going to return to that bugger \u2018g\u2019, and induce him to play nicely with his friends\n\u2018a\u2019, \u2018t\u2019, and \u2018v\u2019. Why? I\u2019m ashamed to admit it, but because I just can\u2019t leave it\nalone. What do you want from me, for\nGod\u2019s sake, I\u2019m a physicist. We\u2019re not\nmeant to be normal.\nLetters and physicists just don\u2019t mix\nshould not shield him, he is undeniably\na racist and it\u2019s only a matter of time\nbefore he declares, \u201cthe south will rise\nagain\u201d. To place him on the front cover\nwith a headline that gave the impression that he might have a point is misleading and an embarrassment to the\nuniversity.\nWhile I am not suggesting that Felix\nsupports the views of James Watson, I\nfeel that the correct criticism of an individual with a deplorable worldview\nhas been pushed aside in favour of\nover-objective reporting by the news\nsection.\nYours Faithfully,\nKadhim Shubber\nThe Editor Tom Roberts responds on\nbehalf of the authors of the article:\nThe article published last week was\nnot intended to be another damning\narticle about Dr Watson. We weighed\nup the available evidence \u2013 including\nDr Watson\u2019s claim that he has been\nmisquoted \u2013 and provided a balanced\narticle whilst exploring the relationship\nbetween the media and casual comments made by scientists.\nEven if it is apparent that the man is\na racist, the national media has had a\nfield day with this story and we didn\u2019t\nfeel the need to put boot in yet again.\nDavid Stewart\nM\ny first taste of S&M\noccured about a year\nago - shortly after a\nseriously heavy night\nof drinking left my\nmouth studded with ulcers. It was so\nstuffed with sores, it felt like my flat-mate had sneaked into my room while\nI was asleep and stuffed the Andes into\nmy mouth.\nUnusually many of these ulcers were\nright under my lip, rather than the\nusual tucked away places somewhere\nunder a cheekbone. While my train\nwas passing through West Kensington station, I dutifully whipped out the\nBonjela I\u2019d bought from Waitrose and\nfound that in this case, I didn\u2019t need\nto perform the usual demoralising\nritual of squeezing half a tube onto my\ntongue and trying to internally french\nkiss myself with the usual face contortions necessary to accomplish such an\nunnatural feat. Indeed, in this case, a\ndirect application onto the bastards\nwas possible. Naturally I screamed\n(which on the district line is perfectly\nnormal when people forget to change\nat Earl\u2019s Court) but managed to get\nmyself under control save for the fact\nthat my eyes were pouring more water\nthan the Diana memorial.\nThe point one realises about Bonjela\nis that it\u2019s not really a medicine in the\nusual sense - it\u2019s main purpose seems\nto be to make the pain so unbelievably bad for ten seconds that the minor\naffliction you started with becomes\nwelcome relief. But it\u2019s so goddamn\naddictive. No sooner had one wave of\nunbearable agony passed than I found\nmyself squeezing more of the poison\nbetween my gums and gritting my\nteeth to suffer the next bout.\nEventually, the ulcers went but I\nfound out that one could obtain similar\neffects from applying Bonjela to cooking burns; not as delicate and fleshy as\nthe inside of a mouth but still intolerably painful. I thought it would be too\nuncouth to start deliberately inflicting\ndamage on myself so that I could douse\nthe injury with Bonjela, so I found\npeople on the internet to help me. It\nis possible, using the correct lashing\ntechnique - Maria, incidentally could\ndo this perfectly, Stephanie tended to\ngo too far - to just break the skin in a\nsingle place.\nAfter an interlude which either involved a G\u00fc chocolate souffl\u00e9 or sex in\nthe missionary position, the initial pain\nhad died down and I would lie prostrate as the Bonjela was rubbed into\nthe afflicted areas while I screamed\nlike Christ on the cross. Eventually, my\nfamily found out and staged an inter-vention, so I had to start hiding tubes\nof Bonjela in toilet cisterns. I became\nso obsessed with it I was sneaking off\nin my lunch hour to grab a hunk of pain\nand a pickled egg in the function room\nat the King\u2019s Head, where Olga the Female German bodybuilding champion\nwould administer to me.\nIn a few months I\u2019d maxed out my\ncards on Bonjela but I almost certainly\nwould have turned to crime to finance\nmy addiction had it not been for the\nfact that I started running out of skin.\nConfessions of a Bonjela addict\nDear Felix,\nI've just got back from the ordeal of\nyet another fire alarm in the Huxley\nand Blackett buildings. I watched the\nhundreds of academics, staff and students standing around in the cold and I\nthought I'd send a letter to Felix about\nhow ridiculous it all is.\nI can only speak for the Huxley and\nBlackett buildings but there seems to\nbe far more fire alarms or fire drills\nthan necessary. As a second year PhD\nstudent I've been turned out of the\nbuilding by fire alarms probably about\n10 or 15 times during my PhD so far\n(no exaggeration). Each time there's a\nrepeating cycle of the shrill alarm followed by a calm voice saying \"In the\ninterests of safety, please evacuate the\nbuilding\", followed by another shrill\nblast etc, etc.\nWhen picking our way through the\nloudly blaring, crowded, dirty, dimly-lit basement corridors following signs\nto the fire exit, my friend shouted to\nme \"It's like Hell!\" and I gave wholehearted agreement.\nEach time I get outside into the\ncrowd of people milling around I ask\nmyself and others if it's a fire drill or\nan actual fire. No one ever knows. It\nturns out that sometimes it's a fire drill,\nother times its a workman's tools making too much smoke, but there's never\nbeen a fire while I've been here. With\nthat in mind I wonder why the entire\npopulation of the two buildings should\nbe turned outside \u2013 a considerable dis-ruption, annoyance and inconvenience\n\u2013 for no good reason.\nIf the answer is that the alarms are\ntesting readiness for evacuation in\nFire alarm after\nfire alarm in\nBlackett and\nHuxley\ncase of fire then I know of some experienced academics who just shut their\ndoor and stay inside during the alarms.\nSo frequent alarms are the alarms that\nthey lead to a \"boy who cried wolf\"\nsituation. If having a hair-trigger fire\nalarm system means it's activated unnecessarily often then it becomes\ncounter-productive.\nSurely a better system would be to\nhave localised fire alarms which evacuate the area near the \"fire\" but not the\nwhole two buildings. Having fewer fire\ndrills would also be a start.\n2nd year PhD student\nSomewhere in Blackett or Huxley\nKeep the swearing to a minimum. Smoke detectors are very sensitive\n\n"

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nW\nelcome to my second instalment\nhere as Arts Editor,\nno doubt you will\nhave missed me as\nmuch as I have missed providing with\nyou with some creative respite. My colleagues have been doing a fabulous job\nin the last few weeks- Arts Felix is a\ndelight to behold each week! Before I\nregale you with some of what is going\non in the Arts world beyond the confines of South Kensington, let me first\ninform you of some great art-sy happenings at IC.\nOne of the finest university orchestras in the country, the IC Symphony\nOrchestra is having its Christmas Term\nconcert next Friday, 23rd November at\n8pm in the Great Hall, Sherfield Building. Its 90 players, including violin\nsoloist Lukas Medlam and conductor\nRichard Dickins, will provide soothing\nrelief from any stress you may be experiencing on account of work, exams\nor the ever-shortening days. For those\nstress-free, it will only add to your\ngood spirits. Works of Gershwin, Barber (composer of the famous Adagio\nfor Strings), Britten and Rachmaniov.\nArt, sex and science. Three intrinsically linked themes rife in this week\u2019s\nArts section. While it is hard to talk\nabout science as if it is one subject (it\nis in fact about a thousand subjects\nput under one umbrella term), sex is\npretty important to science- well to biology anyway. It is the basis of life and\nwithout it, none of us would be here.\nNow that I have stated the obvious let\nus move on. Sex, this critical part of\nscience, has been and will ever be one\nof the most potent inspirational points\nfor Art. This is explored only too well\nin the Barbican\u2019s current set of events\nin which Seduced: Art and sex from\nAntiquity to Now is a part. Now how\nare art and science linked? The exhibi-tion, reviewed in this section, features\nthe photographs of the Kingsley Institute which were used to study sexual\nhabits and behaviour over the course\nof several decades. A seemingly scientific research is present in an artistic context. Fleur Adcock\u2019s poem The\nLast Queen Among the Astronomers\nencompasses science, sex and art as it\ntells of a woman vain in her attempts\nto sequester the attention of die-hard\nastronomers. One of the events laid on\nby the Barbican is Sexual Liberation\nand the Impact of the Pill which takes\nplace on Thursday 29th November.\nThe is hosted by the co-curator of the\nexhibition and also the co-creator of\nthe Pill, Prof. Carl Djerassi of Stanford\nUniversity and sounds highly interesting from an artistic and highly scientific\npoint of view. At only three pounds for\ntickets, it seems a shame to miss out.\nThe Shell Wildlife exhibition bridges\nthe gap between art and science and is\nreviewed here by our other arts editor,\nRosie Grayburn. Poem of the week is\nLeda by Carol Ann Duffy, inspired by\nSeduced. We also get a glimpse into the\ngoings on of the IC Musical Theatre\u2018s\nupcoming production.\nOne grrr-eat photograph\nexhibition... really moo-ving\nRosie Grayburn reports on animal art \u2013 apologies for the title... it was all too easy\nN\never, ever go near the\nSouthKensingtonmuseums at half term. Unless\nyou have an armoured\nbuggy or a cavalry of\ntoddlers or small children preceding,\nyou will have little chance of survival.\nTried and tested child-avoidance tactics include steering clear of giant dinosaur skeletons at all costs. Or, you\ncould hide in the Shell Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition. That\u2019s\nwhat I did, and I lived to tell the tale.\nNow in its 43rd year, the Shell Wildlife Photographer of the Year Competition is going from strength to strength.\nIt is now undoubtedly the single most\nsuccessful wildlife photography contest in the world and photographers\nfrom every country imaginable, amateur and professional, take their [rather\nexpensive] cameras across the globe,\ncapturing wildlife at its most beautiful\nand unusual.\nThe UK population is divided into\ntwo herds, in my opinion: those who\nenjoy watching wildlife programmes\nand those who would rather, quite\nfrankly, have their balls removed with\na blunt blade than endure watching a\nhairier version of themselves swing\nabout in some trees and mate. If you\nare in the latter group, I recommend\nyou try out this exhibition. Give it a go\nand you will be pleasantly surprised. It\nreally is for everyone. Even you there.\nYou enter the gallery with a rather\nominous looking queue of people circulating round the photographs and\nyou think, \u201cUg, what a boring lot of\nlosers looking at each photo for AGES\u201d.\nThen you reach the first photograph\nand get lost in its character and general wow-factor. Each individual shot has\nbeen crafted beautifully, whether it was\na moment apprehended for months or\na spontaneous movement.\nWhat really strikes you as you move\nat a snail\u2019s pace around the portraits\nand landscape, is the energy and patience that has gone into each one.\nThere are small vignettes from each\nphotographer\u2019s experience under every picture. Here is a flavour of what to\nexpect: \u201cThis phenomenon only happens every other millennia. I waited\nin this bush for 12 years, eating only\nsmall grubs and with my camera lenses\nas my only friends until this moment\noccurred.\u201d And my God is it worth it.\nSome pieces make you laugh out\nloud. The picture of a bear rising out of\nthe water made me giggle. It had such\na Russian face and with so much char-acter, too. His face made me think of\nsomeone called Vladimir perhaps, who\nis really pissed off because he can\u2019t find\nhis breakfast vodka. Another comic\nwas the frog in \u2018A Meal of a Worm\u2019 who\nwas chomping away at the worm the\nsame size as his head. He was clearly\nnonplussed at this fact and just kept on\nchewing at that massive, juicy, squirming worm. Yum.\nObviously to keep with current\ntrends, there is a new category to this\nyear\u2019s competition \u2013 The One Earth\naward. Pictures entered into this category had to highlight in a thought-provoking and memorable way, man\u2019s\ninteraction with the natural world and\nour dependence on it. The winner of\nBen Osbourne\u2019s Elephantine Encounter\nBear Necessities: A Teddy Bear\u2019s picnic is the last thing on Sergey Gorshkov\u2019s mind\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nthis category was an extremely powerful image of a shadow of a jet-plane\nfuming across a full moon - a hauntingly beautiful reminder of our all-powerful presence over this planet.\nI really found solace in this exhibition and I was quite moved when I\nrealised that these very talented and\npatient photographers were trying to\nremind us who we shared our planet\nwith. Wildlife is a beautiful treasure we\nshouldn\u2019t let perish. City life can make\nus forget there is more to life than\nbricks and mortar, so I urge you to take\ntime out of your busy urban lives and\nvisit this spectacular exhibition.\n\n"

    "content": "29\nFriday 16 November 2007 felix\nreports on its recent trip to the world\u2019s largest indoor kart track in King\u2019s Cross\nassed by Ballerina, who was plagued\nwith a full-throttle problem on the\nbanked corners during qualifying.\nOut front, The Boss was now in\ncruise and collect mode having made\na good ten to fifteen second advantage\nout of the rest of the field scrapping\nbehind him. Lube Boy and Bob the\nBuilder were furiously scrapping over\n4th and 5th places when they slid into\nthe side of each other coming out of\nturn three, which resulted in the both\nof them scrubbing off a good 10mph\nand allowing FatSlow to sneak back\ninto 4th place!\nNearing the end of the race now,\nDr. Jones and Captain FatSlow have\npulled out a comfortable gap to 5th\nplace and were in the middle of what\nwould go down as a legendary battle,\nwith the two karts swapping positions\nup to three times a lap! Time and lady\nluck ran out on FatSlow, however, as\nDr. Jones got away just after passing\nFrench Fry on the penultimate lap \u2013\nand Ballerina pulls off a sweet move on\nHenry to re-claim his pride by joining\nthe committee pack as the chequered\nflag fell \u2013 the order for the first race\nand thus the starting order for the second race, was The Boss, followed by\nDr. Jones, French Fry, Captain FatSlow,\nLube Boy, Bob the Builder, 2% Lager,\nHenry, Ballerina, and Arsen.\nAfter a very quick five minute break,\nthe karts were out on the grid once\nagain, unfortunately minus one fresher\nwho fell ill in the previous race after\nthe intense session (a lot of us were\nclose to feeling that way too!). Now,\nhowever, the Boss was hoping to cement his domination of the event so\nfar, while Dr. Jones was finally in a\nposition to properly challenge for the\ncrown. French Fry was strategising\nabout holding off FatSlow, who had\nsomething to prove after being wrongly blue flagged (or just because he\u2019s fat)\nin the first race. Henry was looking to\nput his authority on fastest newcomer\nbut would be heavily hounded by Arsen, David and C.J.\nAfter a strong start, on lap six, insult was added to the injury (what a\npacked evening!) of Captain FatSlow\nwho started waving his arms about in\nthe air as his kart ground to a halt \u2013 as\nthere was no more fuel left to carry his\nbulk around the track! He was stranded\nfor three laps before being given a new\nkart that, which was lovingly described\nby FatSlow later: \u201cI had to double my\nbraking distances because there were\nno brakes, and every time I was tailing someone I was almost bound to\nhit them under braking. I also couldn\u2019t\nturn left and the tyres squealed even\non the flat out banked corners, which\nwas rather scary\u2026but DAMN it had a\ngood engine!\u201d.\nHe was put back into position in the\nrace so that he was not three laps behind everyone else, and proceeded to\nunleash a can of whoop-ass as his anger\nblazed the track, setting the fastest lap\nof everybody on the night in the process\u2026andthenhecameacrossBallerina.\nThe instantly recognisable bright red\nsuit was the victim of red mist, as going\ninto the long right hander of turn four,\nFatSlow dived on the inside as Ballerina\nwas nursing his racing line, unaware of\nthe kart nearly pulling alongside. The\nresulting collision caused Ballerina to\nspin, and earned the Captain a onemore-time-and-you\u2019re-out look from\nthe marshals as he cursed himself for\nmaking the error.\nElsewhere, The Boss\u2019 advantage\nfrom the first race looked to be in tatters as he was hounded for several laps\nby both Dr. Jones and French Fry, the\nformer passing him by daring to out-brake into turn five and having French\nFry cheekily follow suit. The following\nlap, however, French Fry took the fight\nto Dr. Jones through the hairpins onto\nthe second banked corner, hugging the\ninside line and drawing alongside. The\nresult was both karts side by side for\nfifteen seconds all the way into\nthe first corner, where French\nFry held his nerve and went\non to take position, barely\nbefore the chequered flag\ncame out!\nAt the end of the race,\ntherefore, French Fry\nstood victorious from\nDr. Jones and The\nBoss, with Lube Boy,\nCaptain FatSlow, 2%\nLager and Ballerina\njust ahead of Henry\nwho was once again\n8th, pride of the new-comers. Post-race, however,\nit was revealed that the entire committee and The Boss were all disqualified\nfor driving too fast, having too much\nexperience, and generally annoying the\nmarshals with repeated requests for\nblue flags, so the prizes were left to the\nfirst time karters.\nClimbing onto the bottom step of\nthe podium was David, finishing 11th\noverall, who received a wonderfully\ncrisp copy of WOMEN\u2019S WEEKLY\nwith his four pack of Carling and tro-phy. Finishing 10th overall just in front\nof him was C.J., receiving the latest issue of FHM and a four pack of Fosters,\nwhile the winner, finishing 8th overall in front of some of the committee\n(!!), was Henry, proudly taking home a\ncopy of NUTS magazine to accompany\nhis four pack of Stella. Unfortunately\nfor Henry, his girlfriend accompanied\nhim on the trip, and was seen with the\nmagazine, presumably for \u2018safe-keeping\u2019, on the walk back to the station.\nFun was most definitely had by all,\nand unfortunately there was no party\nafterwards as everybody was so tired!\nThe kart club\u2019s first trip to the infamous Tilbury track (where we take our\nown fleet of ridiculously fast go-karts!)\nwas next Saturday, however, and much\nneeded to be fixed on the Wednesday\nafternoon preceeding.\nIf you are interested in joining the\nmotor club, learning how to fix\nkarts, playing with our own rebuilt racing mini, driving (safely)\nfast, and participating in the British Universities Karting Championship, please don\u2019t hesitate to\npop down to the motor club ga-rage, on Unwin Road in between\nthe Civil and Mechanical engineering buildings, at 1pm every\nWednesday. You can contact us\nfor a map or with any questions\nyou may have at motor@imperial.\nac.uk.\n\u201cPost-race it was\nrevealed that the\nentire committee\nwas disqualified\nfor being too fast\u201d\nThe three fastest newcomers to the motor\nclub receive their breast oriented prizes\nMost of the fugly mugs of the motor club prior to thrashing things around for a few hours\n\n"

I have played\nagainst many of the top players in this\nleague before, as I represented an England junior team and have experience\nat a national level. Nan Luan won the\nWomen\u2019s Plate at the BUSA championships this February and we teamed up\nto win the Women\u2019s Doubles bronze\nmedal, giving us great confidence for\nthis season.\nOur first match was against Essex,\nwho were without one of their key\nplayers, Abigail Embling- the 2007\nBUSA Singles Champion (who is taking time out to represent England) and\nwe seemed to have them scared (Nan\nnearly beat Abigail at the BUSA cham-pionships!). They failed to turn up and\nwe benefited from a walkover.\nThe following week we visited King\u2019s\nCollege who had Emma Weil \u2013a former\nEngland Top 10 Junior. Nan and I both\nbeat her team-mate Alexandra com-fortably. Nan gave a good effort but\nlost to Emma 3-0. As I won the 1st\nset comfortably against Emma, things\nlooked encouraging but Emma used\nher heavy sidespin serves and prevailed\n3-1. In the doubles, which ultimately\ndecided the rubber, we won the first\ntwo sets comfortably. The King\u2019s duo\nbattled back to take the third set but\nwe held our nerve and won the match\n3-1 to claim the win and send us to the\ntop of the table.\nLast week we played Middlesex who\nare one of the strongest teams in the\ncountry. They have Egle Adomelyte;\nEngland No.6 and Runner-up at this\nyear\u2019s BUSA championships (she beat\nme en-route) and Sarah Brown; another former England Top 10 Junior.\nNan started promisingly against Egle\ntaking the first set but Egle showed her\ngreater experience, to come through\n3-11, 11-6, 11-3, 12-10. I kept it tight\nagainst Sarah and created chances but\nplayed the wrong shots at the wrong\ntime, losing 11-6, 11-7, 11-7. Nan put\nup a good fight against Sarah but lost\n11-7, 9-11, 11-4, 11-6. Finally I played\nEgle who stamped her authority in\nthe first two sets. I played aggressively\nTable Tennis\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 5\nEssex Women\u2019s 1st 0\nTable Tennis\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nKing\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st 2\nTable Tennis\nMiddlesex Women\u2019s 1st 4\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 1\nhitting winners to claim the third set.\nWith the rhythm flowing, I built up\nan 8-4 lead in the fourth set but failed\nto take my chances and Egle used her\ngreater power and experience to win\nthe match 11-5, 11-9, 7-11, 11-9 and\nseal victory for Middlesex.\nIt\u2019s been a good effort in our first\nyear and we are optimistic about this\nseason. Next up is LSE but after that\nis London Metropolitan, who have\nformer Olympic bronze medallist Fei\nMing Tong!! We might need protective\ngear for that one!\nNan Luan and Anusha Senevirante\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nOK, so I made a few mistakes last week.\nWith the overwhelming response I\u2019ve\nbeen getting from all the clubs and societies out there, it was bound to happen at sometime. That\u2019s not me saying\ndon\u2019t bother sending stuff in, that\u2019s just\nme saying that I\u2019m glad you lot are, just\nbe patient with me if I make a mistake.\nAnyway, so last week I managed to\nput the wrong name in for some of the\narticles. Last week\u2019s Ladies Seconds article was actually written by Arabella\nWalker, not Amanda Cheung, so sorry\nBella! And secondly the mountaineering feature, whose pictures I must say\nwere really awesome, was written by\nSebastian Nordgren and not Alex\nBorresen.\nThe last few weeks have been amazing though guys, with there being consistently five or more pages of sport in\nFelix. All I can say is, keep it coming.\nThere are still so many fantastic results\nout there that haven\u2019t been reported on,\nfor example the Men\u2019s 1st Squash team\nwho have been absolutely demolishing\nall their opponents with 5 - 0 wins; let\u2019s\nhear about some of them, guys.\nFinally, plans are under way to produce a special Varsity Sports Pullout.\nMy aim is to include every single varsity match that takes place, hopefully\nwith photos. Varsity Day is on the 27th\nFebruary 2008, so keep the day free in\nyour diaries.\n\n"

At Imperial we\nhave a very wide range of sports people playing in teams from badminton\nto football and rugby to volleyball- do\nyou know what they all have in com-mon? Well they all, in their own unique\nway, place great demands on the body\nand in order to improve your sports\nperformance it\u2019s crucial to recover.\nGetting the right amount of food is essential to this recovery process.\nSo what are these demands? Well for\nexample, the impact of nine times your\nbody weight is taken by your legs when\nyou run at high speeds; or during a golf\nswing, up to 90% of the shear force it\ncan take to cause serious injury in the\nspinal column, can occur. These demands aren\u2019t just limited to high performing athletes. Whether you work\nout at the gym, like to run around\nHyde Park or do nothing at all, your\nbody needs the correct amount and ratio of macronutrients (carbohydrates,\nfat and protein) just to stay alive!\nThis week\u2019s lesson is on protein.\nWhen this word comes up, people\u2019s\nminds often conjure up images of a\nmuscle-bound bodybuilder shovelling\nheaps of a suspicious looking powder\ninto a container after a workout in the\ngym. Let\u2019s get away from this miscon-ception. As I mentioned above, no matter what your sport is, or even if you\ndon\u2019t play any sport, getting the right\namount of protein is very important.\nProtein translated from Latin means\n\u2018first\u2019 or \u2018primary importance\u2019 and\nwhen it is digested it is broken down\ninto amino acids. These acids have a\nnumber of functions in the body but\nwhat we\u2019ll concentrate on in this article is their role in muscle tissue repair.\nSources of protein are all around us.\nBelow is a list of common foods containing protein and whilst it is not a full\nlist, it gives you a general idea;\nBeef, turkey, chicken, ham, fish,\nspinach, tuna, nuts, eggs, dairy products (milk, cheese) as well as protein\nsupplements (more about these in a\nmoment).\nOther foods will have a certain degree of protein in them as well. For ex-ample, wholemeal bread contains 5-6\ngrams per slice so getting your quota\nof protein isn\u2019t all about gorging on\nmounds of meat - variety is best when\npicking your sources of protein.\nSo on to the subject of supplements,\na much discussed topic \u2013 what to take,\nhow much, when to take it and how often - these will be explored in a future\narticle. For now, let\u2019s take a step back \u2013\nis the food we are eating good enough\nto start with? Remember, supplements\nare just as the name suggests - supplementing what we eat already. So let\u2019s\nsort the basics out first, and then we\ncan think about supplements.\nA good guide to eating the right\namount of protein is to aim for around\n0.8-1.5 grams of protein per kg of\nbodyweight per day. So, a 60kg female\nfootballer would need around the 60g\nmark of protein per day, spread evenly\nEmma Brett\nWith three last-minute drop-outs for\nthe BUSA match against RUMS, IC\nWomen\u2019s Football were \u201creliving the\nglory days\u201d (as one of the more senior\nmembers put it), by only managing to\nfield a team of 8 girls. Typically, RUMS\nhad a full team with two substitutes.\nThe formation for the day was 3-4 and\nthe general tactic was to defend, defend\nand defend in hopes of a draw.\nThe first half began with winds of\nthe \u201cballs-kicked-into-the-air-aren\u2019tgoing-to-go-very-far\u201d type against IC.\nAll eight players in the IC half tried to\nlook as big as possible to the advancing\nRUMS, who were all for exploiting IC\u2019s\nsetback.\nRUMS began by attacking heavily,\nwith clever touches from one or two\nof their players to get the hearts of the\nIC players racing. Often the RUMS half\nwas left undefended and counter attacks led by the infamous Pavidra were\nfairly successful, resulting in a number\nof corners. At the time, corners seemed\nlike the only way IC might actually be\nable to score. Unfortunately there was\nonly so much four or five players can\ndo against eleven defending and the\ncorners surmounted to nothing for\nmost of the time.\nThe IC backline played the offside\ntrap well, causing the overzealous referee to have a field day with his whistle\ncalling, frequently calling RUMS off-side. With about fifteen minutes left\nto the first half, Ms. Larice had proven\nthat if you are, in fact that good, you\nonly need one player to be the backline.\nThis gave IC the chance to push up and\nmount more serious attacks that were\nactually worth immortalising in type.\nWith Kate and Emma providing even\nmore support for the midfield/for-wards on the wings, RUMS were being\nstretched at the back and plays were\nmade but most ended with anti-cli-matic shots off target. RUMS keeper\u2019s\nfirst real challenge was presented when\nYoke produced a beautiful, orgasmic\ncross into the box, which landed perfectly at Cheryl\u2019s feet. Unfortunately,\nshe made a mess of it and hit it straight\ninto the keeper, which was a waste.\nThe highlight of the first half, and\nwhat was to be \u201cThe Highlight\u201d of the\nwhole game, was IC keeper Emily\u2019s\nsave (worthy of \u2018Match of The Day\u2019).\nRUMS had taken a powerful shot from\njust outside the box and it was heading\nfor the top left hand corner of the goal,\nleaving the IC team unable to do much\nelse but watch. However, Emily made a\nspectacular dive and just managed to\nget a touch on the ball with her fingertips to send it out for a corner. Because\nof her, IC quite happily ended the first\nhalf with a 0-0 score line and a fighting\nchance.\nWhen the second half started, IC\nwere in the driving seat (even with the\ntwo RUMS substitutes being brought\non) and were beginning to look more\nlike the team who were undefeated last\nseason. Within seconds, IC was already\ndown in the RUMS\u2019 penalty box giving\ntheir backline a run for their money.\nWith the captain screaming encouragement and a couple of threats to her\nteam, RUMS finally made a push and\nbore down on the IC goal. A couple of\nawkward bounces from the ball and\nmiscommunication in the IC defence,\ncaused one of the defenders to collide\nwith the goalkeeper, leaving the goal\nwide open for a scary second. Fortunately, Kate charged in to take care of\neverything, kicking the ball out for a\nthrow-in.\nFrustration began to set in for RUMS\nas the clock wore on. IC\u2019s Lily took\nquite a few pushes which aggravated a\nsustained injury, but she still soldiered\non, as did Emma, despite having being\nviciously stomped on. With exhaustion\nsetting in and tensions running high, it\nlooked as though this match was well\nFootball\nRUMS Women\u2019s 1st 0\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 1\nIC Women\u2019s mighty 8 seal first win of season\nThe ladies football team posing after their win against RUMS\non its way to ending in a draw. But, as\nfate would have it, there was still a goal\nto be scored.\nWith fifteen minutes left until full\ntime, Cheryl netted her first goal for\nIC. In an attempt to keep the ball\nfrom going out for a goal kick, Cheryl\nmanaged to get around a RUMS de-fender, who was chasing the ball out,\nand she stretched out with her right\nleg to smack the ball back towards the\ngoal, just as it was inches away from\nthe backline. The RUMS keeper was\nleft rooted and the ball flew along the\nground, past the defence before hitting\nthe far post and crossing the line. And\nin true Cheryl fashion, she had lost her\nbalance and had watched the events\nunfold whilst lying flat on her back in\nthe grass. 1-0 to IC!\nHeavy defending followed to protect\nthe precious lead but still, it did not\nstop Pavidra from leading charges into\nthe RUMS\u2019 half with her lightning feet.\nFinally, the whistle blew and a very\ntired IC side celebrated their unlikely,\nbut definitely well-earned victory.\nBring on the next match.\nAfter the setback of the first match,\nlast week was crunch time for the\nMen\u2019s 1st Fencing team as they needed\nnothing less than a win to keep their\nchances of being promoted alive (and\nto stop the gloating from the men\u2019s 2nd\nteam). This chance came in the form\nof a home match against Southampton\nmen\u2019s 1st.\nLike the previous match, foil was the\nfirst weapon to be contested and following the slightly under par performance the week before, there was a large\namount of pressure on them to step it\nup a gear. With this in mind, the captain\ndecided that a change was required in\nthe anchor position (the most important position in the team). However,\ncontrary to all advice given to him,\ninstead of putting himself as anchor\nhe chose Nathan (much to Nathan\u2019s\ndisappointment). Unfortunately this\nchange did not have the desired affect\nand foil ended with a deficit of 11 hits\nin favour of Southampton.\nNext up was epee to salvage the mess\nthe foil team had created, and after a\nrocky start (mentioning no names-Ed!) Imperial started to make up the\ndeficit. In particular, Sjoerd\u2019s stunning\nindividual performance, handing out\n7 unanswered hits, to gain the \u2018Man\nof the Match\u2019 award. Consequently,\nby the time the epee team had worked\ntheir magic the scores were level, at 79\nhits a piece.\nThe last weapon of the contest was\nsabre, bearing the hopes of the team\n(especially the under-performing foil-ists). Once again, they did not get the\nperfect start everyone wanted however with an excellent comeback, Alex\nsteered the team into the lead so that\ngoing into the final bout Imperial led\nin sabre (and overall) by 2 hits.\nThus after 26 bouts of fencing, the\nwhole match came down to the 27th\nand final bout. Things were not meant\nto be and we lost by a narrow margin of\n5 hits. Yet again leaving only the trip to\nthe bar as consolation.\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st Fencers lose out to\nSouthampton 1st in a tight battle\nFencing\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 119\nSouthampton Men\u2019s 1st 124\nChris Gilliam\nClose but no cigar\nfor IC fencing throughthemealsoftheday.Thisisjust\nan example and will change depending\non your activity level and other factors.\nConsult a member of the Energia team\nabout this if you are unsure.\nPlaying sport puts various intense\ndemands on your body- sprinting,\npassing, catching, shooting and tackling etc. Getting the right amount of\nprotein is essential if you want to perform at your best.\nNatural vs. Manufactured- are\nyou using them the right way?\n\n"

From making boxes to the drainage system, to that poor sod Paul\nChris Chivers\nSo, I\u2019ve been in the beautiful city of\nVancouver for just over a week now.\nI\u2019m worried I\u2019ll fall in to the trap of saying everything\u2019s amazing in an attempt\nto convince myself that I\u2019m having the\nbest time ever and rub it in the faces\nof everyone back home. But I\u2019ll try and\nveer away from that type of stuff. By\nthe way, it\u2019s ok for me to call Vancouver\nbeautiful; all the vehicle license plates\nhave \u201cBeautiful British Columbia\u201d\nproudly engraved onto them. However,\nit did take me a good few days to realise\nwhat these cars were going on about...\nWhen the plane landed at the airport\nlast Wednesday, it marked the beginning of 5 days of constant rain. According to the locals, rain is very common\nthis time of year \u2013 this time of year\nbeing until bloody May. Oddly, for a\ncity that apparently has so much rain,\nthe drainage system seems pretty poor.\nThe streets are commonly lined with a\ngood inch or two of water meaning a\nsoggy foot is all but inevitable. Sorry,\nthis is hopelessly veering off track, I\u2019m\nsure there are more interesting things\nto talk about other than the drainage\nsystem.\nOn Monday, the rain stopped, the\nclouds lifted and the sun came out\npractically wearing a hat upon his incandescent head. I had landed a job,\nwhich was described to me by the\ndisinterested woman on the phone as\n\u201c...just moving some tables about really\u201d. So, I made the most of the sunny\nweather by going for a stroll around\nStanley Park and was just staggered by\nthe beauty of the city. The combination of snow capped mountains, skyscrapers and luscious blue waters was\nenough to make me stop in my tracks.\n(well I didn\u2019t actually stop. I was running a bit behind and needed to get to\nwork. Those tables weren\u2019t going to\nmove themselves)\nSince being in Vancouver, I have had\na total of 4 different job placements\nacquired through a temping agency.\nThese have ranged from the ridiculous\nto the downright dull. Most recently I\nhave been making boxes in a clothing\nwarehouse... um, and I honestly can\u2019t\nelaborate any more on that. Making\nboxes \u2013 those two words completely\nsum up the job description, the job\nresponsibilities, the job requirements,\nthe skills acquired, the high points and\nthe low points of the job. Oh Christ,\nit was terrible \u2013 I spent a total of 17\nhours making boxes. Every so often\nthe supervisor would walk past and offer such encouraging words as \u201cKeep\nmaking boxes!\u201d I can\u2019t for the life of\nme think why he felt the need to keep\nsaying that \u2013 well, to be honest, it may\nhave been encouragement to prevent\none from becoming suicidal.\nAs beautiful as the license plates claim\nTravels without my Aunt \u2013 Part Two\nTheo Georgeiou Delisle small children who gather in wetsuits\naround your car, you may exit your ve-hicle. Not there sir, sorry, that is quick-sand. It should be noted at this point\nthat the parking area in Polzeath also\ndoubles as the beach, which distressingly enough is covered with water in\nan almost rhythmic pattern every day.\nFor this reason it is a good job that\nyour car is on its last legs, but who buys\na car in sunset mauve anyway? Loser.\nNow it is time to hit the sea, get out\nthere you maniac! For the convenience\nof visitors Polzeath is manned by fully\ntrained beach bums, who don\u2019t mind\npretending to be life guards in their\nspare time.

Once you\nhave acclimatised to the water, it will\ninvariably have got dark so it is time to\nreturn; but do not worry intrepid trav-eller, the luminous condoms floating\nflirtatiously in the water around you\nwill guide you safely back to the beach.\nOnce back on the beach you are presented with a number of options. For\nmany, the simple pleasure of whacking\nstranded, innocent jellyfish on the head\nwith a cheap plastic spade is entertainment enough, but I understand that\nthe Imperial College student deserves\nmore. It is for this reason that Polzeath\nis happy to accommodate the world\nrenowned Daymer Bay West sewage\noutlet 36b. Feel free, as many tourists\ndo, to splash and frolic in the frothy\nstream which runs out to sea, safe in\nthe knowledge that dysentery can actually make a rather good topic across\nthe dinner table.\nAfter wiping the sand off your laptop you are ready to leave the dunes\n(although there are none) and hit the\ntown for a taste of the local nightlife.\nThe town is unfortunately not ready\nto hit you back, save from the late\nnight second-hand bookstore which\nstocks all of your seventeenth favourite\nbooks, so you must drive home immediately before the tide claims your car.\nBack in London you are free to watch\nAlvin, Simon and Theodore to your\nheart\u2019s content. I don\u2019t undestand it either\n\u201cPhew, it\u2019s a scorcher out there!\u201d and\n\u201cIt\u2019s bikini o\u2019clock\u201d are just two of the\nphrases that you will not hear if you\ndecide to visit Polzeath in Cornwall,\nor indeed if you visit any other place\nin Cornwall. For many young upstarts\nhowever, a trip to Polzeath is the inevitable answer to the question, \u201cwhere\ncan we go right now, seeing as we have\nno money and even less imagination?\u201d\nRegrettably it is not the answer to the\nquestion \u201cWho were the three chipmunks in that show, about the chip-munks, you know the one\u2026?\u201d\nPolzeath is located at a jaunty angle\nalong the Cornish coastline, strutting\nout almost defiantly opposite the town\nof Padstow which Rick Stein, the fish\ncook, made famous by cooking fish in.\nIt can be reached by a pleasant costal\npath which winds its way haphazardly\naround the dangerous cliff edges, or by\na less pleasant road which will test your\n14 year old break pads to well beyond\ntheir limits.\nOnce you have avoided the hoards of\nminder that success is fickle and failure is never far away. While temping, I\nfound myself crossing paths with a guy\n(Canadian for \u2018man\u2019) called Paul on a\ncouple of occasions. Paul, 50-ish, is\nalso employed by the temping agency\nand occasionally we are assigned to the\nsame job. Paul is sad and has no life.\nThat is not a cheap, derogatory swipe,\nbut the actual truth. He isn\u2019t happy because he left his previous job (as a finance manager) to travel the world and\nafter spending all of his money found\nhimself unable to get back into a stable work position. As a result he lives,\nunmarried, in a small room in a tower\nblock on the rough side of town and\ngets about one day of work a week out\nof the employment agency.\nPaul confessed that the reason he\nBut there was a glimmer of hope.\nOn the first day, after about 4 hours\nof box making, the supervisor asks me\nif I fancied a change and leads me to\nthe other side of the warehouse \u201cOK,\nthese boxes are a little smaller, but you\nassemble them in just the same way\u201d.\nAnd just in case I didn\u2019t understand\nor needed reminding he added \u201cKeep\nmaking boxes!\u201d Anyway, that job has\nfinished now and I promised myself I\nwould never sink that low again.\nHmm, I feel like I should talk about\nthe people I have met, but I don\u2019t want\nsay things like \u201ceveryone is lovely\u201d or \u201cI\nhave made hundreds of friends\u201d. After\nall, all the lovely people could turn out\nto be cheeky thieving bastards.\nThere is one guy, however, who has\nstuck in my mind and is a living redoesn\u2019t get any work is because he is\nnot very good with computers and is\nbetter with his hands. He shared the\nhilarious anecdote of how he was given a job position in an office and was\nthere for 10 minutes, staring blankly\nat Excel, before being asked to leave!\nActually, I don\u2019t think he found it particularly hilarious. And come to think\nof it neither did I. And yesterday, after\nbeing confronted by a roll of sellotape,\nhe gave in and admitted that he wasn\u2019t\nvery good with his hands either, which\nbegs the question; does this man have\nany skills at all? This question was in\nthe back of my mind on the way home\nand I came to the conclusion that yes,\nhe does have a skill, the skill to keep\nsmiling and not kill himself. Poor guy.\nUm, oh dear, this has gone wildly off\ntrack. I\u2019m not sure whether I should\ndelete the last couple of paragraphs as\nit seems inappropriate, lacks any kind\nof relevance and isn\u2019t even that inter-esting. But I won\u2019t.\nSo getting back on track about the\ncity itself: Like London (and probably\nevery other city in the world), Vancouver contains a number of sub-districts\nwhich can usually be summed up in\none word; posh, gay, cheap, dirty, boring etc. They all seem to be pretty safe\napart from the East Side which is full of\nmental tramps. The tall lady (Hmm, is\n\u2018tall\u2019 really the extent of my vocabulary\nthese days? I\u2019m sure there are more descriptive and linguistically interesting\nthings to say about her. But she was\nquite tall. Long arms...) at the orientation talk said this was because Vancouver used to have a mental hospital but\nit was closed down and the patients\nwere left to wander the street. She then\nadded \u201cit\u2019s not funny guys\u201d.\nSo in my first week, I have been\nproved that the license plates are indeed correct; Vancouver is an extremely beautiful city. At the moment, I am\nvery happy with everything, although\nthat\u2019s probably down to the cocaine!\n(only joking\u2026)\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel\nTravel Editors \u2013 Ahran Arnold and Nadine Richards\n25\nFriday 16 November 2007 felix\n\n"

Caz Knight seeks to answer this valuable question and receives\na different kind of Sex Education at the Barbican\u2019s latest offering. Prudes be warned \u2013 skip these pages\nS\neduced- Art and Sex from Antiquity to Now- it\u2019s all in the\nname. The Barbican gives us\nsex through the medium of\nart in all its guises, from long\nbefore Christ was born right up to the\npresent. It invites us \u201cto become a participant in the history of the display of\nsexually explicit art\u201d while considering\nthe relationship between pornography and art. The dictionary definition\ntells us that porn is media designed to\nstimulate sexual excitement. (From the\nGreekword\u2018pornographos\u2019-thewriting\nof harlots). If this is true, ANYTHING\ncan be potentially pornographic- there\nare no bounds to what people find or\nwill find arousing, however sexual\nor non-sexual those things might be.\nOne reviewer for The Guardian asks\nthe question- has art ever been about\nanything else? And it is a very good\none indeed. From the moment sexually\nreproducing beings came to exist, the\nact of sex has been pivotal to our exist-ence, pleasure and sanity.\nNo one knew this better than Classical Civilisation, bedrock of Western\nsociety. \u2018Sex and Cold Marble\u2019 kicks off\nthe show with some stunning marble\nsculptures dating back to the second\ncentury. The image of (half) naked Roman statues is a common one (none\nmore famous than Michaelangelo\u2019s\n\u2018David\u2019). This section sees sensuous\nnymphs, eager satyrs and hermaphrodites sculpted of marble, which were\nall inspiration for artists such as Picasso and Rodin.\nA few steps down the corridor and\nwe are reminded of just how much\nsexually explicit objects were looked\ndown upon and regarded as a danger\nto society. In 1857 came the \u2018Extreme\nPublications Act\u2019 designed to protect\nthose in society who were most at risk\nof corruption- women, children and\nthose lacking either education or social\nstanding. As a result many works of art\nand historic relics portraying inappropriate scenes were kept away from the\npublic eye and kept in a private collection for a few select people to behold.\nOn one hand, we are a hundred times\nmore sexually liberated one hundred\nand fifty years on but one can not help\nthinking that in some ways sex is still\nregarded as terribly risqu\u00e9. More often\nthat not in the news and other forms\nof media, sex is always associated with\nseediness or in a terrible context (child\nmolestation, rape). Never do we sing\nits praises and examine the beautiful\nside of it. Almost never. Seduced makes\nexception in many cases. One example came in the \u2018Between the Covers\u2019\nsection, featuring exquisite paintings\nfrom 17th century India. The attention to detail in these tiny works of art\nwith amazing colours and brush-work,\nmade for some beautiful viewing. One\nof the works- \u2018The Private Pleasure of\nDanyas Son of Emperor Akbar\u2019 \u2013 depicted a couple twisting themselves\ninto very difficult-looking kama sutra\npositions, under starry, moonlit skies\nand gold-roofed temples.\nAnother highlight was the glowing\ncolours of \u2018Leda and the Swan\u2019; a copy\nof the original painting by Leonardo\nda Vinci, which was lost. The legend\nof Leda and the swan is that the Greek\ngod Zeus came to earth as a swan,\nthereby seducing Leda mere hours after she had conceived her two children\nby her husband King Tyndareus.\nThe exhibition shed some light on\nthe sexual practices of old and those\nfrom different cultures. Crotchless\npanties were a thing of the past it\nseems, as was pornography showing all\nsorts of naughty things. 19th century\nexposures- delicate and smooth tex-tured- were made all the more interesting for the Amy Winehouse-esque\nbeehive sported by one of the subjects.\nSeeing gentlemen and ladies inflicting\npain (and pleasure) on each other and\nbeing tied up with bondage rope, all\nthe while in their Victorian finery- tail\ncoats and voluminous skirts plumped\nup with petticoats!\nMy attention faltered ever so slightly\nwhen faced with cabinets of manu-scripts, books and relics such as the\nGrecian ceramics (depicting a few\nquestionable acts involving livestock)\nand amber phalluses. Interesting as\nthey were, one starts to feel a little\nmore like one is in an educational sort\nof museum rather than an art gallery.\nAny interest that might have waned is\nbrought back instantly on the second\nfloor by the surrealist works of twisted,\npsychedelic sketches and photographs\nfrom what appeared to be an acid-fuelled sex party circa 1966 (actually\n120 minutes dedicated to the Divine\nMarquis) involving cream being licked\noff various body parts, public urination\nand spanking. The books of said Marquis of Sade, father of BDSM (bond-age-discipline sado-masochism), lie in\nan adjacent room.\nSeveral large and vibrantly colourful\nJeff Koons paintings are on display- reinstating some of the tackiness I was\nratherhopingforinanexhibitioncalled\n\u2018Art and Sex\u2019. Photography is combined\nWhat on earth could they be doing?? Thomas Ruff\u2019s \u2018Nudes\u2019, one of many provocative works of art\nMichaelangelo\u2019s David decided against underwear despite the cold\nwith oil inks on canvas in \u2018Ilona on\nTop\u2019 and creates a glorious fantasy-like\neffect, this time highly reminiscent of\nthe porn industry. Thomas Ruff\u2019s low\n-resolution images are attractive and\nalso very original.\nInspired by underground film, Andy\nWarhol\u2019s \u2018Blowjob\u2019 is a 41-minute black\nand white film fixed on the face of a\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nman while he is fellated (41 minutes\nseems rather long, however, apparently 5 \u2018givers\u2019 were used during the\nfilm). Somehow when one sees these\nthings in black and white it makes the\nwhole experience feel more classy. I\ndid not stay for the duration, only to\nappreciate the rather handsome chap-DeVeren Bookwalter- who would later\nappear in a Clint Eastwood film, The\nEnforcer. Charles Rydell was Warhol\u2019s\nfirst choice but Rydell \u2018chickened\u2019\nout, and so Bookwalter was chosen\nas he happened to be hanging around\nWarhol\u2019s studio-cum-hangout, The\nFactory. K.R. Buxey\u2019s female answer to\n\u2018Blowjob\u2019 is \u2018Requiem\u2019, this time a colour film that features her receiving oral\npleasure. Again, the camera is fixed on\nher face as the act progresses.\nProbably one of the most mersmeris-ing and beautiful pieces I have seen in\nany exhibition is \u2018Heartbeat\u2019 by American documentary photographer Nan\nGoldin. Goldin has explored the post-punk new-wave music and gay scenes\nand hard-drug subculture, but here she\nfollows five couples as they go about\ntheir day- sex is a definite feature but\nis set against other activities such as a\nnight out or day in the park. The photographs are presented in a slide show,\naccompanied by the angelic voice of\nBjork, singing \u2018Prayer For the Heart\u2019\nwith classical music by John Tavener.\nThe effect is spell-binding and very\nmoving. Although the images depict\nlove, happiness, tenderness and pas-sion, the music creates a slight pathos.\nSeduced: Art and Sex from Antiquity\nto Now does exactly what it promised-it shows us art in all lights: scientific,\nsexual and even morbid. It is definitely\nnot pornographic- there is no seediness here, as is often associated with\npornography-some pieces one would\nnot consider inherently sexual. I was\nalso struck by how most viewers were\nnot fazed by what was on show- if only\nsociety as a whole could be this way.\nBe seduced: but by Art or by Porn?\n\n"

(Weeks hall\u2019s golden jubilee will follow in just a couple of years,\nso we will talk about it later). We have\nbeen celebrating in style!\nEveryone knows Garden Hall: a row\nof Victorian houses on the North Side\nof Prince\u2019s Gardens, between Sports\nCentre and Weeks hall. Some people\nmay even know that both Garden &\nWeeks halls are grade II listed build-ings. (I know this can be hard to believe but Weeks is an architectural\ngem of the 50s!) What no one knows\nis the fascinating history behind G&W\nhalls, which dates back to the Great\nExhibition in 1851 and involves illustrious residents as Sir Henry Singer\nKeating, Solicitor-General in two of\nPalmerston\u2019s administrations and first\ntenant of house 11, Lord Blackburn\n(1861-1887), Sir William Earle and Sir\nWilliam Drake (until 1891), or Rt. Hon.\nLord Walter Gordon-Lennox, PC (un-til 1921).\nGarden Hall\u2019s Victorian houses\nwere completed in 1860, adjacent to\nthe Great Exhibition site. The developer was Sir Charles Freake and John\nJohnson was the probable architect\n(apparently he is well-known for mid-Victorian buildings in London). At the\ntime, these houses were an \u201caffordable\u201d\noption to Belgravia or Mayfair, for professionals and minor noble families.\nYes \u201caffordable\u201d, but they still needed\naccommodation for several family\nmembers, a few guest bedrooms and\ntwo or three elegant rooms for entertaining guests; and of course rooms\nfor a dozen or so servants, usually on\nthe top floor; and finally a service area\nwith kitchen, wine cellar, coal cellar,\nlaundry, servants\u2019 eating room etc, in\nthe basement!\nIn more recent times, during the\nsecond World War, the houses were\nrequisitioned by the government and\nused by the Admiralty and, by the late\n1940s, passed to the hands of the London Hostels Association. It seems that\nhouses 8-15 Prince\u2019s Gardens were\noffered to the College for student accommodation as part of a bid (led by\nSir John Betjeman, poet and founder\nof Victorian Society) to keep Colcutt\nTower \u2013 now Queen\u2019s Tower! \u2013 in the\nearly 50s. Imperial and the hall soon\nplayed a role during the Hungarian\nUprising in 1956 by welcoming exiled\nstudents in house 12.\nGarden hall was formally inaugurated in 1957 and, that year, the college\nGoverning Body minutes would justify\n\u201cThere is (\u2026) a general agreement that\nthe full University training is not obtainable unless the student spends at\nleast a part of his career in residence.\n(\u2026) the need for increased residential\naccommodation was \u2018reinforced by\nthe presence in the Universities of increased numbers of students who come\nfrom homes with little or no tradition\nof culture and whose undergraduate\nlives would be greatly enriched by a\nperiod of residence in Hall.\u2019\u201d!\nEvery year, Garden hall becomes the\nhome of 82 Imperial freshers in single,\ndouble and triple rooms, who enjoy its\nimpeccable common room, previously\nthe oak-panelled study of Sir Henry\nKeating looking onto the garden.\nThe senior re-app (hall senior) has\nthe honour of occupying the Gothic\nguest room, set up for Lady Elizabeth\nVernon in the \u201830s, but all bedrooms\nare unique: room 5, for example,\nwas the drawing room of Sir William\nDrake!\nYou may wonder: \u201cwhat are students\ndoing in Victorian houses in South\nKensington?\u201c I would argue that was\nthe very purpose of Prince Albert! You\nsee, Prince Albert, as president of the\nRoyal Commission for the Great Exhibition (and using the \u00a3186k profit\nof the exhibition!) decided to establish\nthe site as an \u201ceducational and cultural\ncentre\u201d for London. I just hope we live\nup to the expectations\u2026\nPut this in your title and smoke it\nI\n\u2019m getting a bit bored of smok-ers. After all the bans and temporary surges in \u201cquit now\u201d ad-vertisements, it\u2019s true that I see\na lot less lighting up than I used\nto. Obviously, some are pushing their\nluck in enforcing the law \u2013 drawing a\nline around a building is probably a little too far \u2013 yet it seems that there\u2019s a\ntactic agreement now that smoking is\nbad for everyone\u2019s health, not just the\nsmoker. And despite this, we still don\u2019t\nseem to have the courage to put heel to\nbutt and stamp the last embers out.\nI used to be of the opinion that if you\nwantedtodieslowlyandpainfullywhile\nyour family watches on and blames\nthe health service, then that was your\nchoice. But lately I find myself refram-ing the smoking issue to represent the\nworst of what disappoints me in the\nhuman race right now.\nFirst, the eternal joy of discussing the\nethics of smoking with a smoker. My\nfavourite kind is the one that maintains\nthey know what it\u2019s doing to them, but\nare okay with it. A message to those of\nyou reading this that are this kind of\nsmoker \u2013 you are not, and will never\nbe, Kurt Russell. You\u2019re just a tit who\u2019s\nbeen smoking for so long that you\u2019re\nactually embarrassed about how dependent you\u2019ve become on it.\nSecond, the absolutely ludicrous human rights grounds on which some\nsmoking groups opposed the bans\nfrom. Yes, self-harm is legally okay. Yes,\nI should be allowed to do bad things\nto myself if I want to. But if I started\ncarrying around weapons-grade plutonium in my coat pocket, I think the\npeople around me would view it as a\nlittle antisocial.\nFor me, it\u2019s representative of how\nunwilling we are to give up things that\nmake us feel good \u2013 fuel inefficient\ncars. Really loud music at 1am. Ant\nand Dec. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I don\u2019t\nlike the idea of giving up my Taste The\nDifference cookies so that I can donate more to charity and even up the\nworld\u2019s karma. You don\u2019t miss the difference until you\u2019ve tasted it, let me\ntell you. But the fact that people want\nto cling onto a damaging, expensive\nand disgusting habit just because it\u2019s\nmore comfortable to light up with an\nevening coffee than not, well\u2026 it\u2019s a little saddening.\nI know not all smoking is bad \u2013 an\nacquaintance of mine has to smoke a\npipe as part of a medical condition he\nhas. Obviously, the stuff he smokes is\nmedicated, rather than the pipe itself.\nPlus, there\u2019s the slightly weaker claim\nthat smoking keeps people off other\ndrugs, or at least slows their abuse of\nthem. But if that\u2019s the only defence you\ncan muster for a habit that kills thousands ever year, I think you need to\ncheck what it is that you\u2019re smoking.\nHah. Great jokes to be had here,\nhonestly.\nMaybe I just don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d drug abuse\nvery well \u2013 like Cyndi Lauper, or burping on demand. Maybe everyone likes\nsmelling like they\u2019ve rolled around in\nsmouldering horse poo, and kissing\npeople that taste of wet smouldering\nhorse poo. And maybe it\u2019s not as representative of human kind if you assess\nit in any reasonable terms.\nBut seeing as we\u2019re still discriminating against everyone we can get our\nhands on \u2013 ISLAMISTS LOL \u2013 the ice\ncaps are still melting, and the Middle\nEast is still being crept up on from all\nsides by the encroaching legions of idiots with cruise missiles, I think that if\nwe can\u2019t analyse ourselves far enough\nto quit inhaling carcinogens ten times\na day, I\u2019m going to need to emigrate\nfurther than Canada after all.\nGarden & Weeks Hall celebrates its 50th\nJo\u00e3o T.

    "content": "35\nfelix\nFriday 16 November 2007\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nStrapping up the thumb\nHannah Barr\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nA thumb sprain is a partial tearing of\nthe ulnar collateral ligament and is\ncommonly associated with contact\nsports such as rugby, as well as football goalkeepers, volleyball, skiing and\ngymnastics. Today I\u2019ll focus on rugby.\nThis injury is particularly common\nwithin rugby due to the aggressive attacking nature of the game. It can occur when sufficient force is applied to\nthe thumb in a direction away from\nthe hand. This could be as a result of\ncatching the ball, where the ball hits\nthe top of the thumb forcibly bending\nit, when tackling or when being tack-led, and also during a maul when the\nopponent will try to prise thumb and\nfingers away from the ball to effectively\n(albeit painfully) loosen grip.\nDue to this particularly rough sport,\noften players choose to protect the\nthumbs with a support bandage during training and matches. However\nthis may prove to be uncomfortable\nand make gripping and catching more\nchallenging due to reduced hand and\nthumb mobility.\nSigns and symptoms of a thumb\nsprain will be pain and tenderness\nover the ulnar collateral ligament of\nthe thumb. This ligament is located at\nthe \u2018web space\u2019 between the base of the\nthumb and the base of the index fin-ger. This ligament supports pinch and\ngrasp activities, and helps the hand\nfunction properly.\nDue to the often traumatic and/or\n\u2018accidental\u2019 nature of this injury there\nare usually no signs and symptoms.\nHowever following injury you may\nnotice some or all of these symptoms:\nthumb pain, thumb swelling and bruis-ing, loss of range of motion and functional ability, poor grip.\nIf you are uncertain about what damage has actually taken place, it is advisable to consult a sports injury expert/\nGP in order to treat it effectively.\nIce packs and compressions are the\nbest treatments immediately following injury, alongside rest and elevation\nwhere possible. Sprains are usually resolved in around 4-6 weeks and can be\naided by physiotherapy and/or sports\nremedial massage treatment. For additional pain relief, use anti-inflammato-ry gels and/or NSAID\u2019s.\nStrapping up the thumb is relatively\nsimple, and these guidelines should\nhelp. An underwrap is used to protect\nskin from abrasion during play, and\nparticularly when pulling taping off.\nElastic adhesive bandage (EAB) is a\nflexible tape that provides support, but\nallows some movement and stretch.\nThis protective layer will help prevent\nfurther damage during play. Obviously\ndue to the aggressive nature of rugby,\nthe player will still need to attack or\ndefend in the same way as usual, so\nthe support is simply there to act as a\nbarrier to tissue damage. It does not\nmean the injured part will not be damaged further. In an ideal, and perhaps\nsensible world, participation would be\nhalted until the injury had recovered\nfully, but usually injuries such as this\nthat are often deemed as \u2018small\u2019 and\n\u2018insignificant\u2019 knocks will not bring an\nend to play, but this depends largely on\nan individuals pain threshold!\nYou could use the EAB support method once injury has actually occurred\nbecause it will provide greater stability and protection. Then, if preferred,\nuse a more flexible support when applying as a preventative measure, such\nas a tubi-grip/modified wrist splint, so\nmore movement is possible whilst also\ngiving some support.\nIt is recommended that remedial\nexercise should focus on regaining\ndexterity, mobility and strength of the\nthumb, fingers and hand as a whole.\nRegaining dexterity can be done with\ntherapeutic putty, hand therapy balls\nwill relieve thumb stiffness whilst resistance exercises that tax grip ability\nwill restore normal hand and thumb\nstrength.\nIn order to avoid this in the future, it\ncomes back to the preventative measure of taping-up during play, or simply\nbeing prepared with the correct first\naid provisions to deal with the acute\nphase, i.e. RICE (refer to previous is-sue) if it occurs.\nWeek 7 and a lot more results are in.\nThe ranking of the teams is based on\nthe Felix Index (FI), which is calculated\nas follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) \u2013 (L*4).\nOnly teams with 5 games or more will\nbe considered in the overall championship at the end of year.\nWith this week\u2019s results in, Netball 1st, Squash Men\u2019s 1st and Tennis\nMen\u2019s 2nd (this week\u2019s Team of the\nWeek) continue their unbeaten streak\nand are top of the table with 25 points\neach. With the Hockey Men\u2019s 1st losing their fixture on Wednesday, they\nslip 5 places to 9th and are replaced by\nRugby Men\u2019s 1st in 4th place.\nA mid table scrap is beginning to\nemerge between the men\u2019s Badminton\n2s and Rugby 3s, as well as the ladies\nFootball, Lacrosse and Squash\nAt the bottom of the table, the poor\nstart to the season by Hockey Men\u2019s\n4th and Football Men\u2019s 2nd, leave them\nboth rooted to the bottom of the table.\nTeam P W D L F A Diff % FI\n1 Netball 1st 5 5 0 0 287 125 162 100 25\n2 Squash Men's 1st 5 5 0 0 25 0 25 100 25\n3 Tennis Men's 2nd 5 5 0 0 41 9 32 100 25\n4 Rugby Union Men's 1st 6 5 0 1 125 49 76 83.3 21\n5 Fencing Men's 2nd 4 4 0 0 525 423 102 100 20\n6 Tennis Women's 1st 4 3 1 0 30 10 20 75 17\n7 Squash Men's 2nd 5 4 0 1 17 8 9 80 16\n8 Football Men's 1st 4 2 2 0 8 3 5 50 14\n9 Hockey Men's 1st 5 3 1 1 15 9 6 60 13\n10 Rugby Union Men's 2nd 5 3 1 1 113 77 36 60 13\n11 Hockey Women's 1st 5 2 2 1 17 13 4 40 10\n12 Volleyball Women's 1st 2 2 0 0 6 1 5 100 10\n13 Cricket Men's 1st 5 3 0 2 926 678 248 60 7\n14 Table Tennis Women's 1st 3 2 0 1 9 6 3 66.7 6\n15 Football Women's 1st 4 1 2 1 3 3 0 25 5\n16 Basketball Men's 1st 1 1 0 0 70 42 28 100 5\n17 Rugby Union Women's 1st 1 1 0 0 50 5 45 100 5\n18 Rugby Union Men's 3rd 6 3 0 3 128 92 36 50 3\n19 Lacrosse Women's 1st 4 2 0 2 31 31 0 50 2\n20 Squash Women's 1st 4 2 0 2 10 7 3 50 2\n21 Badminton Men's 2nd 4 2 0 2 15 17 -2 50 2\n22 Cricket Men's 2nd 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n23 Equestrian 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n24 Equestrian 2nd 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n25 Fencing Women's 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n26 Golf 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n27 Volleyball Men's 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n28 Water Polo Men's 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n29 Hockey Men's 2nd 5 2 0 3 23 12 11 40 -2\n30 Hockey Women's 2nd 5 2 0 3 7 21 -14 40 -2\n31 Fencing Men's 1st 3 1 0 2 347 344 3 33.3 -3\n32 Table Tennis Men's 1st 3 1 0 2 30 21 9 33.3 -3\n33 Netball 2nd 3 1 0 2 87 87 0 33.3 -3\n34 Squash Men's 3rd 1 0 0 1 1 2 -1 0 -4\n35 Hockey Men's 3rd 5 1 1 3 6 9 -3 20 -5\n36 Tennis Men's 1st 5 1 1 3 16 34 -18 20 -5\n37 Badminton Women's 1st 3 0 1 3 10 22 -12 0 -10\n38 Badminton Men's 1st 5 1 0 4 18 22 -4 20 -11\n39 Football Men's 3rd 5 0 1 4 4 16 -12 0 -14\n40 Football Men's 2nd 4 0 0 4 2 13 -11 0 -16\n41 Hockey Men's 4th 4 0 0 4 3 14 -11 0 -16\nNB: Treatment for a complete\nligament tear would be different\nto the advice given.\nEAB strapping over underwrap\nUnderwrap strapping\nACROSS\n1 Brilliant, in what sounds like a great\nmind (9)\n5 Obliterate the very best of facial\nproducts (5)\n8 Craving for exotic currency (3)\n9 Abstain from the chorus (7)\n11 Paddle into a rough storm (3)\n12 Break my heart, O Gaia (5)\n14 Ride around Ontario during a\nwindstorm (7)\n16 Public demand for Charles to become\nGeorge, thus having beauty and\ncharm (7)\n18 Unvarying outfit (7)\n20 Examine bug having swallowed page\n(7)\n22 Suggest that the elf is a little loopy (5)\n24 A short article (3)\n25 Ointment applied to wounded cat in\norganization (7)\n27 The seven dwarves provide a\nconclusion (3)\n28 Nuclear warhead explodes my male\nrelative (5)\n30 Words put in emphasis to indicate\nhow socialists\u2019 hearts are not in the\nright place (7)\n32 Nothing in the goblet to divide up\nand sell illiegally (7)\n33 Sounds like I whip facial hair (7)\nThe winner of last week\u2019s crossword\nwas Alex Crosse.

Second row Tom Zeal\ncharged down a kick from the Middlesex fly-half and then managed to scoop\nthe ball up and score the opening try.\nIt seemed that this was going to be an\neasy day, and this thought was definitely embedded in everyone\u2019s mind when\nthe ball was gracefully passed along the\nline to the other second row Bo Sasegbon who scored the second try 5 minutes later.\nIt was at this point that the side began to get complacent, especially in the\nforwards. Players were waiting in the\nattacking line, ready for their chance\nof glory and to seal a dramatic victory.\nHowever this was not going to be as\nMiddlesex realised what Imperial were\nus to and decided to show them what\nthey could do. And this was achieved\nwith a converted try right before the\nend of the first half.\nImperial had something to prove,\nthey were not showing signs of a team\nwho were top of the table, and after\nsome stern words from the coach, captain and vice-captain, Imperial had to\nget out of their complacent groove.\nChanges were made with flanker Nick\nJohnstone being brought on, only to\ndo a massive tackle, then throw up and\nhave to be taken off after only 5 min-utes, hence earning himself the title of\nTwat of the Match.\nBut the side was slowly beginning to\nget back into their style of play, with\nprop Terry Addo (the other Twat of\nthe Match) putting in some big American football style hits. Centre James\nFletcher, showing his strength and skill,\nmanaged to put a huge hit on the Middlesex winger from a high ball, only for\nthe referee to give a penalty for a \u2018high\u2019\ntackle. Tom Carroll seemed to be the\nonly consistent player on the pitch, always running with intensity and tackling with aggression, thus rightly earning himself the Man of the Match title.\nEventually Imperial got back to the\nlevel they had at the start of the game\nand flanker James Pettit scored the final try to leave the score at 25 \u2013 7 at the\nfull time whistle.\nNathan and his kamikaze style of fencing\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd Fencing team extended their unbeaten start to the season to three matches by demolishing\nan under-strength Royal Holloway 1st\nside.\nThings immediately looked promising when Royal Holloway arrived with\nonly three fencers. As has become tradition this season, sabre was fenced\nfirst, with Luka Lukic given the all important anchor position after his stunning performance last week. He didn\u2019t\ndisappoint, romping to a 5 \u2013 2 victory\nover his first opponent and setting the\ntone for the rest of the match. Team\ncaptain Maurice Berk struggled against\nthe opposing captain in his first con-test, going down to a 5 \u2013 6 defeat but\nstill leaving Imperial in the lead. Will\nHoy found himself on the right side of\nanother close score-line, winning his\nfirst match 5 \u2013 4. Maurice continued to\nstruggle, surrendering Imperial\u2019s lead\nas he suffered a heavy 4 \u2013 8 defeat at\nthe hands of his second opponent, but\nLuka quickly recovered it with a 6 \u2013 0\nvictory. Will had a second close match,\nagain winning 5 \u2013 4 before Maurice\nredeemed himself with a 5 \u2013 1 victory\nover his final opponent. With Will and\nLuka winning their final matches 5 \u2013 2\nand 5 \u2013 0 respectively, sabre finished\nwith Imperial enjoying a commanding\nlead at 45 \u2013 27.\nFoil was up next and Nathan Blundell\ngot things off to a great start with a 5 \u2013\n0 victory in his first match. New man\nAlex Bishop, in for the absent Ez Hassan, continued Imperial\u2019s winning ways\nby brushing aside his opponent 5 \u2013 3.\nNoris Lo made it three from three with\nanother excellent 5 \u2013 2 win. The rest\nof the weapon continued in this vein,\nwith the second round of matches being won 5 \u2013 0, 5 \u2013 1 and 5 \u2013 2 by Alex,\nFencing\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 135\nRoyal Holloway Men\u2019s 1st 68\nMaurice Berk\nFencing 2nds still unbeaten\nNathan and Norris respectively. Royal\nHolloway were simply outclassed as\nAlex won his final match 5 \u2013 2, Norris\nromped to a 5 \u2013 0 victory and Nathan\nsaw off his opponent 5 \u2013 2. With the\nscores at 90 \u2013 41 before going into\n\u00e9pe\u00e9, Imperial had already won, with\npride the only thing left to play for.\nLuka kicked \u00e9pe\u00e9 off with another\nassured 5 \u2013 4 victory against his first\nopponent. Maurice struggled to a 2 \u2013 5\ndefeat while Alex won his first match\n7 \u2013 5, leaving Imperial a point behind\nin that weapon. Maurice did better\nagainst his second opponent, winning 6 \u2013 4, while Luka won his second\nmatch 5 \u2013 2 and Alex drew his 5 \u2013 5.\nMaurice then elected to sub himself off\nfor Nathan who was keen to give \u00e9pe\u00e9\na go. He proved to be a roaring success,\nquickly developing a unique kamikaze\nstyle of fencing whereby he dramatically launched himself at his opponent\nwith deadly accuracy. His opponent,\nfaced with such a vicious onslaught,\nslumped to a 5 \u2013 1 defeat. Similarly,\nAlex and Luka both won their final\nmatches 5 \u2013 1 to wrap up yet another\nImperial victory. \u2018Man of the Match\u2019\ngoes to Alex for his excellent debut.\nImperial travel to rock-bottom Portsmouth next week, as they aim to take\nanother giant step towards winning\nthe league.\nImperial\u2019s backs attempting another attack on the Middlesex line\n\n"

We\nwow you not once, not twice but thrice!\nYes thrice, it\u2019s a word you should use\nmore often, perhaps more than thrice.\nRehearsals are already steaming ahead\nfor our first spectacular performances\nof the winter term. MTSoc doesn\u2019t go\nand watch the shows. No, no. We create and perform them. Filling up our\nlittle lungs and unleashing full blown\nentertainment upon those of you who\ncome to see us.\nThe Revue, which goes out on the\n2nd and 3rd of December, is an ensemble of our favourite songs from some\nvery different musicals, indeed. It\u2019s\ncalled The Rise & Fall of David Sullivan. We\u2019ll be performing classics from\nthe likes of Fame, Chicago and Rent to\nthe more outrageous Avenue Q and\nWicked. Having a soft spot for all things\ncheesy, there\u2019s a place for Grease and\nHigh School Musical too. The story revolves around our titular techie, David\nSullivan. For those of you wondering\nwhat techies are, they\u2019re the backstage\nhandy-folk who rig sets, sort out lighting and are a pretty essential bunch of\nany production team. That said, they\nare seldom seen, seldom heard and\nvery nearly never clapped for.\nIn the story, Dave messes up a show\nfinale and he messes up big time.\nMusical Theatre Society is brilliant\nThe Director of this winter\u2019s MTSoc Revue Ali Salehi-Reyhani tells us a little bit about sex. Haha got you\nlooking! You filthy sleaze. The Revue, The Rise and Fall of Dave Sullivan is reviewed henceforth...\nThere\u2019s a revolt amongst the cast, angered at their embarrassment, erupting into a rather horrid lambasting of\nDave and his fellow techies. Within\nDave though, something is sparked, an\nalmost maniacal desire to conquer the\nfrontstage. There, he will be revered\nand he will know fame. This fuels the\nrise and, quite literal, fall of Mr Sullivan and all his friends. They include\na closet lesbian who just can\u2019t live a lie\nanymore after her lifelong boyfriend\nBob reveals his inner desires to be a\ntransvestite- no musical production\nwould be complete without a man in\nwomen\u2019s panties now would it? Love,\nheartbreak and even death are no\nstrangers in this tale. We\u2019ve woven\nsome morals into the narrative and we\neven have a message of tolerance and\none towards forward-thinking. That\nsaid, if you\u2019re going to get your morals\nfrom a 90 minute-long musical which\nis ripe with gay jokes, then you really\ndo need to shoot yourself.\nSo come and witness our most ambitious Revue yet at the Union Concert\nHall (Beit Quad) at 7:30pm on the 2nd\n& 3rd December. It\u2019s free and all funds\nraised will be donated to the Children\nwith Aids charity.\nGo and see the Revue on the 2nd\nand 3rd of December. It is a great\nshow and if all goes to plan, you\nwill not be able to breathe with\nlaughter\nMTSoc peoples doing their morning stretches with jazz hands to the left and right. Meanwhile the director can be seen jumping up and down like a madman at the back\nDramatic\n\n"

Michael Cook tests it out on some unsuspecting readers\nThe Pro: James Warren The Rookie: Flora Wilson\nThe Pro: Flora Wilson The Rookie: Michael Cook\nS\nometimes, I like to discover\nthings, you know? Not all\nkinds of things, not by any\nstretch of the imagination.\nThere are literally thousands\nof things that I don\u2019t want to know anything about, and they could fill several\ntelevision schedules. In fact, if you have\nChannel Five and Hallmark, they do fill\nthem on most weekdays.\nBut some things I definitely want to\nlearnthingsabout.Whyeveryonehates\nAmerica, why I feel the need to insert\na bar joke into every issue of Felix, why\nanyone thinks Statistics is something\nI\u2019d like to learn. These questions don\u2019t\nreally have answers, no matter what my\nFriday morning lecturer says, but some\nother questions do. Sensible ones.\nThe thing with sensible questions is\nthat they usually have very, very long\nanswers, or answers that are wrapped\nin a documentary presented by a boob\njob on legs for Channel 5. I don\u2019t want\nto read a three-inch thick exposition of\nfeminism, but I also don\u2019t want Kirsty\nGallacher jiggling around universities\nin Slough asking seventeen year-olds\nwhether they feel oppressed or not.\nSo where\u2019s the happy medium? Enter the Very Short Introduction series,\nwhich you may well have come across\nbefore. The Oxford University Press\u2019\nline of brief overviews cover an ever-expanding range of topics, and claim to\ndo exactly what it says on the cover \u2013 be\nshort, be precise, and be informative.\nBetter still, they\u2019re concise despite\nbeing written by experts in the field,\nand the high quality of editing means\nthat you get a nice flow to the proceedings while sitting safe in the knowledge\nthat you\u2019re being told the truth.\nBut can you judge a book just by its\ntitle? At Felix, we wouldn\u2019t dream of\ndoing such things. And so, to uphold\nour three-week tradition of sky-high\njournalism standards, we\u2019ve employed\npeople we vaguely know to do our job\nfor us. Are the books accessible enough\nif you\u2019ve got no grounding in their subject whatsoever? And if you\u2019re already\nstudying in the field, does the book\nhave anything to offer you at all?\nThanks to the Oxford University\nPress, we\u2019ve been able to test exactly\nthat, by taking some readers and offering them topics they\u2019re both familiar\nand unfamiliar with. James Warren,\nour resident Physicist, goes toe-to-toe\nwith Flora Wilson of Mathematics and\nmyself; I moonlight as a Computer Scientist when I\u2019m not on Felix.\nDid the books stand up to our three\ndemanding critics? Is reviewing a book\nabout journalism a strange fourth-wall\nthing? Does anyone actually want to\nhear my joke about the magician who\ngoes into an alley and turns into a bar?\nRead on.\nN\newton is easily one of\nthe biggest names in\nthe history of scientific\nmethod, one of the familiar faces of English\nscience that gets dragged out again and\nagain, and yet many of us know little\nabout him.\nThis introduction covers all of the\nmost popular aspects of the man, as\nwell as many that may usually be left\nout; such as his unusual opinions on\nreligion and lesser-known occupations\nsuch as Warden of the Mint.\nAs far as Biographies go, Newton\ndoes a lot. There\u2019s nothing that feels\nunmentioned, and the tricky balance\nbetween anecdotal \u2018evidence\u2019 and actual records is hit quite well.\nThe Pro: Michael Cook The Rookie: James Warren\nThe only problem lies in Rob Iliffe\u2019s style \u2013 a little to curt and a little\ntoo professional, without the zest you\nmight have come to expect from the\nseries.\nIt\u2019s still good, and functions reasonably well as a reference book, too, but\nif you\u2019re familiar with Newton\u2019s work\nalready, his life may be of less interest\nto you \u2013 particularly when presented\nin such a dry manner.\nO\nther than the apple\nthing with the tree, I\ndon\u2019t know an awful lot\nabout Newton, which\nis a bit shameful given\nhis impact on... most things in the 17th\nCentury.\nIn fact, Newton surprised me in\nmany places with the extent of Sir\nIsaac\u2019s influence on things such as the\nRoyal Academy and his research that\nfurthered the field of Optics.\nIt also chronicles his brief but historically enduring battle with Leibniz over\nthe inception and application of calcu-lus, and the illustrations in the book\noffer great insight into the first outings\nof some of modern science\u2019s greatest\nmethods and theories, not least the apple thing with the tree.\nThere\u2019s also a lot of richness in Newton\u2019s life that keeps the book from being one long textbook \u2013 he held many\nstrong and lasting friendships with a\nwide variety of people, and his life covered a lot of fields of interest. Even his\ndeath, with which the book begins, is\nan interesting tale.\nThe writing doesn\u2019t always electrify,\nbut its content does, and as a whistle-stop tour of Newton\u2019s achievements,\nthis book really works.\nB\neing a bit of a tricky subject to work around, even\nfor those that actually do it\nfor a living, Chaos is one of\nthe more abstract flavours\nof Very Short Introduction, explaining\nmuch of its material in its own terms\nand analogies, meaning it may not sit\nperfectly if you\u2019ve studied the subject\nbefore.\nNevertheless, Smith\u2019s style is very\nreadable \u2013 he makes excellent connections between theory and real-ity, something vital for this topic, and\nworks hard to cover varied theories in\na very compact book.\nIt doesn\u2019t go very deep, as one might\nexpect given the series title, but the\nreal let-down to those with some background in Chaos is the lack of any\nmathematics whatsoever. The text is\nlively enough to guarantee that you\u2019ll\nbe shown something new, but fans of\nmeaty technical info should return to\ntheir textbooks.\nEven without an equation in sight,\nChaos is a worth addition to the book-shelf. It\u2019s well-edited, it knows how to\nseparate the interesting from the dull,\nand it doesn\u2019t miss out what\u2019s vital.\nP\nerhaps \u2018Pro\u2019 is a bit of a\nstrong word, given I spend\nmost of my time thinking up\ncaptions and fighting with\nMacs in the Felix offices\nrather than uncovering the truth and\npushing up literaryt standards across\nthe board. Nevertheless, Journalism is\ndefinitely an interesting title for me.\nUnlike the \u2018applied\u2019 VSI books, Journalism is more of a tour-de-force of\nJournalistic concepts, trends in history,\nand the great and noble art of writing\nabout things that are happening.\nEven though it reads itself like a tabloid at times, Journalism is written in\nan engaging way and throws a lot of\nquestions at the reader at the same\ntime as showing some lesser-known\nstories behind the big media events of\nthe last century or so.\nFor anyone considering writing in\ntheir future, Journalism gives a lot of\nfood for thought. Whether it\u2019s an intellectual discourse is debateable, but it\ntries its utmost to cover the ethics both\nof yesteryear and the next generation\nof writers, and generally does it with a\nlot of sensitivity, describing finally the\nnext age of journalism.\nT\nhe idea of mathematical\nmodelling fills me with\nenough dread on its own;\nthe news that most models are actually inherently\n\u201cunpredictable\u201d in some sense of the\nword, was obviously a bit of a kicker\nfor me.\nThankfully, Chaos is devoid from\nmuch numeral-based confusion, save a\nfew wibbly graphs and some fairly peculiar poetry choices.\nSmith fits the bill of a VSI author perfectly \u2013 sharp, observant and down-to-earth, his examples and wordings\nhighlight difficult-to-grasp areas and\nquickly break them down, introducing\nthe concept of Chaos \u2013 a phenomena\naffecting systems such as Climate and\nmyriad others \u2013 gradually.\nWeather forecasting is either very\nimportant or very obvious in the realm\nof Chaos, because Smith relates most\nof his examples to it, and even though I\nwas in the mood for a little variation by\nChapter 10, the subject as a whole remains gripping \u2013 the force affects the\nworld to a mystifying degree, which\nChaos only scratches.\nEasy to grasp and genuinely important for any applied scientist, Chaos is\ndefinitely worth picking up.\nM\nost of us read a newspaper in some form\nor another \u2013 whether\nit\u2019s a London Lite\nyou\u2019ve had thrown at\nyou by a vendor, or a Financial Times\nyou\u2019ve picked up so that people think\nyou\u2019re clever.\nJournalism does its best to get under the bonnet of modern journalism,\ncharting its progress up to the modern day and offering some insight into\nwhere it may be headed. It\u2019s a good\ncompilation of statistics, excerpts, stories and serious opinion, put together\nand tied up in a subject that\u2019s none too\nboring.\nFor some reason, it doesn\u2019t really\nclick with me. It may be that you need\na more journalistic base to really \u2018get\u2019\nJournalism; it may just be that Hargreaves\u2019 writing style \u2013 which has all\nthe characteristics of a lifelong journalist \u2013 doesn\u2019t appeal. Whatever it is,\nI found the book flagging a little after a\nfew chapters.\nStill, if you\u2019ve got your heart set on\nlearning more about a key occupation\nof the next century, you could do a lot\nworse than read this. It\u2019s concise and\ngenerally unbiased \u2013 which makes it\ngood journalism in itself.\nThe Professional\u2019s Opinion\nOne apple short of a tree.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nThe Rookie\u2019s Opinon\nScience isn\u2019t always fascinating,\nbut Newton\u2019s life certainly was.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nThe Rookie\u2019s Opinion\nIt needs a little time, but Chaos is\na great read.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nThe Professional\u2019s Opinion\nA fantastic summary of a really\ninteresting subject\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nThe Professional\u2019s Opinion\nJournalism offers a good look at\nsomething we take for granted.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nThe Rookie\u2019s Opinion\nMaybe I read the Guardian too\nmuch.\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\n\n"

The statement comes in response\nto a student who contacted Felix airing his frustrations at the multitude of\ntimes he has had to be evacuated. Concerns have also been raised about the\ndifficulty people have had when exiting\ntheir departments during an alarm due\nto newly installed revolving doors restricting mobility.\nA second year PhD student, who\nwishes to remain anonymous, wrote to\nFelix expressing his annoyance at having to go through yet another evacuation \u201cordeal\u201d. The postgraduate said\nthat since he had been at Imperial, he\nhad experienced between ten and fifteen evacuations and that nobody ever\nhad an idea whether it was a drill or an\nactual fire.\nFelix contacted Ian Gillett, College\u2019s\nSafety Director, who said that he was\n\u201cconcerned by the number of fire\nalarms\u201d that were going off around\ncampus. There are only supposed to\nbe two fire drills per year, with one per\nterm whilst students in halls can expect to experience one more on top of\ntheir departments\u2019 drills.\nUnless College has been swiftly extinguishing blazes without anybody\nnoticing, there have been seemingly\nno fires around campus in the past two\nyears, which begs the question: why\nare students within Huxley and Blackett being turned out of their buildings\nup to eight times a year?\nMr Gillett continued by saying that\nthere are a number of possibilities:\ncontractors are often to blame when\nusing power tools that kick up a lot\nof dust, or students who \u201cspray a bit\ntoo much Lynx\u201d can trigger an alarm.\nMeasures are in place to cut down the\nfrequency of fire alarms; \u201cpre-alarms\u201d\nare designed to monitor changes in\nthe air around them. For example, if a\ndevice detects a slight increase in the\namount of smoke within a room, a\nmessage can be sent to the fire officers in College who can quickly get to\nthe location before a problem erupts.\nHowever, inevitably there are going to\nbe incidents that are too severe for the\npre-alarms and the evacuation alarm\nwill be raised instantly.\nTalk of cutting down on recurrent\nalarms is all well and good, but a worrying amount of people choose to remain in their offices or labs ignoring\nthe noise blaring out around them.\nThe PhD student suggested frequent\nfire alarms \u201clead to a \u2018boy who cried\nwolf\u2019 situation\u201d citing some academics\nhe knows that just \u201cshut their door and\nstay inside during the alarms\u201d.\nMr Gillett acknowledged this was a\n\u201cbit of a problem\u201d that stems both from\npeople not being educated enough by\nthe fire drills and also because people\nare not informed why they have been\nevacuated when there has been a genuine problem. If people are not told\nwhy they are being ejected from their\ndepartments, then next time they will\nsimply become frustrated and assume\nsomething minor has happened that\nwon\u2019t affect them if they remain where\nthey are.\nHowever, the Safety Director admitted he didn\u2019t know the solution to\nthis problem. He suggested that people could be disciplined when they\u2019re\ncaught sitting in their offices, but again\nthis would have a \u201cnegative influence\u201d\non people.\nEvacuating only those people near\nwhere to an alarm is triggered is also\nunfeasible as the procedure is too\n\u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cpeople become\nconfused\u201d when only certain people\nare made to leave a building.\nThe problems with the College\u2019s fire\nprecautions go beyond just the alarms\nthough; the new revolving doors that\nhave been installed in Blackett and\nHuxley are also a cause for concern.\nSome students have reported to Felix\nthat they have been a part of queues of\npeople saying to each other: \u201cYou go\nfirst,\u201d which is then followed by, \u201cNo,\nafter you, I insist.\u201d In this situation,\nstudents are advised to seek alternative exits if they can foresee difficulties leaving through any of the main\nentrances.\nWhen questioned, Mr Gillett told\nFelix that he had been \u201cassured\u201d by\nhis colleagues that the new revolving\ndoors provided just as much space for\npeople to exit through as the old doors\ndid in Blackett and Huxley.\nFelix measured the distance across\nthe revolving door in Blackett, comparing it to the remaining old door\nwhich stands next to it. The result: the\nopening in the revolving door measured 1.2m whilst the old door measured 2m wide. The number of people\nthat can safely be in the building remains the same since the Ring of Steel\nwas introduced.\nUltimately, College\u2019s fire precautions\nare designed to stop people from becoming charred husks of their former\nselves, but with the sensitive nature of\nsmoke detectors and Imperial\u2019s current\nstatus as a giant building site the future\ndoesn\u2019t bode well for those people who\nlose their sanity at the shrill of a fire\nalarm.\nThe PhD student\u2019s letter can be\nfound in full in the Comments\nsection on page 5\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nTommorow marks one year to the day\nfrom when Imperial College students\nvoted \u201cyes\u201d to joining the NUS (Na-tional Union of Students). However,\nsince the Union\u2019s re-affiliation, have\nstudents at Imperial actually noticed\nany differences?\nLast November, after three days of\ndedicated campaigning by pro- and\nanti-NUS teams in which the student body was collared, persuaded\nand bribed to vote either way, more\nthan 4,000 votes were cast to decide\nwhether Imperial College Union (ICU)\nwould rejoin the NUS. In one of the\nUnion\u2019s most successful elections in\nliving memory, the majority of 53%\nvoted \u201cyes\u201d in favour of the NUS.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time ICU had\nre-affiliated with the NUS. The Union\nhas had an on-off history with the NUS\nand since 1922 there has been a motion\nin every decade to rejoin, culminating\nin four successful attempts including\nlast year\u2019s.\nAffiliation doesn\u2019t come cheaply: the\ncurrent cost per annum is \u00a344,000. So\nwhat are we supposed to get in return\nfor this vast sum of money, and more\nimportantly, what have we got so far?\nThe NUS is a one of the world\u2019s\nlargest student organisations, giving\nunions throughout the UK and Northern Ireland political clout which they\nwould lack on their own. Not only does\nit provide representation and advice\nfor Unions, it fights \u201cbarriers to education\u201d and \u201cempowers students to shape\nboth a quality learning experience and\nthe world around them\u201d according to\nthe NUS website.\nThis is all very well, but having talked\nto a number of Imperial students this\nweek, it seems the \u2018benefits\u2019 are having minimal impact. Felix spoke to a\nnumber of students, one of whom \u2013 an\nAeronautical Engineering student \u2013\nconcisely summed up the most common feeling by saying she \u201chasn\u2019t felt\nthe effects of joining the NUS.\u201d\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nThe most immediate benefit to the\nstudent body is in the form of a discount card: the NUS Extra Card, pictured on the front page being held by\nfirst year Bioengineering student Fernando Pacheco. Mr Pacheco told Felix\nthat having bought his NUS Extra Card\nat the start of term, he \u201chasn\u2019t used it\nyet\u201d.\nThe card costs \u00a310 and is supposed\nto bring students discounts at many\nnational stores, websites and restaurants such as amazon.co.uk, JJB and\nMcDonalds. However, it seems some\nof the companies associated with the\nNUS Extra Card don\u2019t even recognise\nit when presented with one. Ricardo\nSmith, a first year Civil Engineer told\nFelix he went to \u201cSubway and tried to\nuse [his] card, but they rejected it and\nwouldn\u2019t let me get my 10% off\u201d before adding: \u201cI haven\u2019t really got a clue\nwhy I spent the money on it in the first\nplace.\u201d\nStrangely enough, some students\nthat Felix spoke to said they have had\nbetter luck using their NUS Extra Card\nin other countries since it also acts as\nan ISIC (International Student Identity\nCard); the logo can be seen on the top\nleft of the card. This entitles the holder\nto discounts abroad.\nSince Imperial rejoined the NUS,\n579 Extra Cards have been purchased;\naround 5% of the student body. This\nequates to 27% of the 2134 students\nthat said \u2018yes\u2019 to the NUS last year.\nHave the other 1500 or so students that\nvoted yes all graduated (meaning they\ncan\u2019t buy a card now), simply forgotten to buy a card, don\u2019t care or did they\nvote the NUS in because of its political\nweight and not to save money?\nPerhaps the Union is to blame: many\nstudents complained to Felix that they\nhadn\u2019t seen any posters or other forms\nof advertising for the card. It\u2019s not\nsurprising awareness is low when the\nUnion President (one of last year\u2019s vocal anti-NUS campaigners) is seen on\nstoic television slating the NUS calling\nit a \u201ccomedy sideshow\u201d.\nStephen Brown, the Union President,\nhas expressed his disappointment with\nthe re-affiliation so far, telling Felix\nthat \u201cto date we have not got our money\u2019s worth.\u201d Mr Brown believes that if\nthe \u201cgovernance [ie: the structure] of\nthe NUS is sorted out, then we might\nbegin to see the benefits.\u201d Its setup is\nundergoing dramatic change at the\nmoment and there is an Extraordinary\nConference next month in Leicester\nthat is going to discuss and decide how\nthe NUS will function structurally.\nSupporters and critics seem to agree\nthat changes in both the Union\u2019s and\nthe NUS\u2019 governance will benefit the\nstudent body as a whole. One of last\nyear\u2019s pro-NUS campaigners, Alex\nGuite, commented to Felix that \u201calthough governance is not the sexiest\ntopic, reviewing it with the help of the\nNUS has been very helpful for our union and in turn we are helping the NUS\nreform itself.\u201d\nMr Guite is also keen to point out\nthat the NUS has provided ICU with\nnumerous networking opportunities,\nwhich have yielded otherwise unobtainable advice. Furthermore, with the\nNUS\u2019 support, ICU has developed a\ntrade union for its own student staff,\nsomething that Mr Guite says will\nbenefit \u201call students who work for the\nUnion.\u201d He is also quick to point out\nthat the President himself has received\nexcellent training from the NUS.\nIn reality though, are students going\nto feel the effects of the governance reformation that both Mr Guite and Mr\nBrown highlight as positives changes?\nAsk any student about ICU\u2019s very own\nnewly-formed Trustee Board and how\nthe Union\u2019s dynamics have been affected as a result, and you will most likely\nbe met with a blank stare. The NUS is\neven more far removed than this.\nAdvocates of the NUS also point out\nthat without the affiliation, ICU would\nbe an insular and segregated body\nwithout a voice on the national scale,\nespecially since we left the University\nof London Union (ULU) last year. By\nhopping from the ULU bandwagon\nand onto the NUS one, supporters\nhave argued that we are saving over\n\u00a330,000 due to the difference in the\naffiliation fees. However, the point is\nirrelevant in many students\u2019 eyes, as\nthey believe that Imperial College Union is an influential enough institution\nthat doesn\u2019t need support from either\nof the bodies \u2013 it can stand on its own\ntwo feet.\nIf this were the case the Union would\nbe saving itself at least \u00a344,000 per year;\na vast amount that could be put towards the Union redevelopment, currently in hiatus, or into the clubs and\nsocieties. Mr Pacheco said he would\n\u201cmuch rather see the money spent on\nthe Basketball society.\u201d\nA year on from ICU\u2019s re-affiliation\nreferendum, it seems the student body\nhas scarcely felt any effect of the NUS.\nAlthough not entirely clear how, the\npromise of governance revisions may\nbring noticeable benefits to students.\nHowever only time will tell whether\nthis is just another flirtatious bout between the unions or if the two are destined to be bedfellows this time round.\nThe Union is looking for students\nto attend the NUS Extraordinary\nConference on Tuesday 4th\nDecember. If you want a free\ntrip to Leicester to represent\nyour Union on a national scale,\nand to help influence the NUS\u2019\ngovernance, email: felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\nMoney, money, money in the NUS\u2019 hand\n\n"

Expectations were\nhigh for the night race which was due\nto start at half past ten, with all 20 karts\non track at once for qualifying and two\n25 minute races.\nNaturally, thinking that several\nfreshers may be late, a rather embarrassed Captain FatSlow was the last to\narrive with Lawnmower, but the party\nwas soon moving. After a brief period\nof confusion which saw the group get\nsplit into two on the way to South Kensington station, confidence that we\nwould still have 20 by the time we got\nto King\u2019s Cross diminished slightly\u2026\nbut somehow we all managed to get on\nthe tube with everybody still intact.\nThe walk from King\u2019s Cross was\nuneventful with the exception of the\nworld cup match between England and\nFrance ending while we were on the\ntube\u2026and French Fry\u2019s canned rampage cranked up a notch as England\nkick their way into another world cup\nsave. There was generally poor lighting\nto the venue, which looked very much\nlike an abandoned warehouse until\nwe all walked around the back which\nrevealed a rather lavish looking hospitality entrance to The Raceway, decorated with pictures of various famous\nracing drivers that have floored throttle pedals in anger, including Nigel\nMansell, Jenson Button, and Michael\nSchumacher.\nOnce signed in our suits were issued,\nand we walked into the rather large\nchanging rooms, thinking that something about this place was going to\nbe a bit grander than expected. Walking into the race hangar (really, there\u2019s\nno better word for it), we stood wide\neyed at a spectacle of twists, turns,\nlong straights, floodlit barriers, and\nbanked corners (yes, banked corners\nin go-karts!!) that was Europe\u2019s longest\nindoor kart track. After a cheeky chat\nwith the race director, which resulted\nin some of the names on the timing\nscreen being replaced with our motor\nclub nicknames, we all got out safely on\ntrack for our ten minute practice and\nqualifying session, where our fastest\nlap would determine our grid position.\nThe karts were surprisingly good,\nfast, precise, and most importantly\nvery close to each other in terms of\nspeed. While the freshers got used\nto the karts, the motor club committee wasted no time setting the track\nablaze, and the end of the session saw\nThe Boss on top, followed by Captain\nFatSlow, Lube Boy, Dr. Jones, French\nFry, Bob the Builder, 2% Lager and Ballerina. After what seemed like an eternity on the forming up lap, the safety\nkart pulled in for the rolling start and\nthe first race was go!\nThe Boss got off to a flying start\nwith FatSlow sniffing his exhaust, but\nunable to pass. Meanwhile, a massive\nscrap for third through sixth ensued\nwhile freshers spun all over the place\nbehind the committete, resulting in\nyellow flags and bunching the pack up\nagain on just lap three, with the front\ntwo kart\u2019s small lead destroyed. When\nracing resumed, Captain FatSlow mysteriously got a blue flag to let the kart\nbehind pass despite being on the lead\nlap! Ignoring it three times before deciding they were signalling for him,\nhe reluctantly got out of the way to\nlet what turned out to be French Fry\npast\u2026and the three karts behind him\nas well, cunningly stealing the space\nFatSlow had left.\nThis error on the marshals\u2019 part\nmade for an interesting race now \u2013 despite The Boss driving away out front,\nFatSlow was now demoted to 6th and\nhad to play catch up. Meahwile, French\nFry was given a stern looking at as he\nkept taking his hands off the wheel to\nsignal angrily at the backmarkers.\nMeanwhile, Henry, the highest qualifying newcomer in 8th place, had a disastrous start and was in 12th place by\nlap two, being forced likewise to play\ncatch-up. CJ, starting in 10th, was involved in an interesting coming together and was also demoted to 19th off the\nstart line, which left Arsen, starting in\n9th, no time to waste as he took 8th\nplace and held a considerable gap to\nthe crowd behind. Henry was immediately back on the ball, however, as he\nregained two places by lap three and\npassed David by the end of lap five to\nput himself, incredibly, only one place\nbehind where he started the race!

The last time\naction like this occurred was in 1988\nand with terrible results; over 3,000\npeople were killed. Well since the\nspotlight is on, let\u2019s examine this nation with a confused name, dictatorial\nmilitary rulers and a people mired in\npoverty.\nI guess we should start with the pro-tests. At the height of the unrest, between 50,000 and 100,000 people were\nmarching in the streets of Rangoon \u2013\nthe capital of Burma. A quick look at\nthe numbers should highlight an important fact. While 1 million protested\nin the UK against the Iraq war, only a\ntenth protested in Burma for freedom.\nThe reason is that as a poor, rural society it is difficult to mobilise large\ngroups of people but more importantly\nmany people fear a response similar to\nthe bloody crackdown in 1988. What\nstarted these protests as in 1988 was\nnot discontent at dictatorial rule \u2013 of\ncourse this helps \u2013 but primarily economic hardship. The government increased the price of fuels, resulting\nin a knock on increase in the price of\nother goods such as food and public\ntransport. The people drew confidence\nfrom the participation of monks, who\nhold a revered position within Burmese society. Fortunately the government response was not as bloody as in\n1988 but there have been thousands of\narrests and although there are no exact\nfigures the death toll is thought to be\nmuch higher than the military\u2019s figure\nof 9.\nThe Western international community was quick to condemn the Burmese government and call for democracy in Burma however there is little\nevidence that they have any effect in\nthis isolated state. Burma has chosen\nto expel the UN\u2019s top diplomat and\nwestern sanctions continue to have no\neffect on a country who has trade links\nprimarily with Russia, China, India\nand Thailand. Burma is a country rich\nin natural resources such as timber and\ngas, and the growing economies of East\nAsia are more interested in strong economic ties than the spread of democ-racy. Russia in fact plans to sell a nuclear reactor to Burma. U.S. sanctions\ncontinue to be ineffective because of\nthe trade with Asian countries and\nhave simply resulted in a lack of leverage over Burma. The only hope for international pressure is through China,\nMyanmar is \u201cessentially a client state\nof China,\u201d says Mathea Falco, chair of\nthe 2003 CFR Independent Task Force\non Myanmar. But with President Hu of\nChina recently stating that economic\ndevelopment is the primary aim of the\nChinese government, it is unlikely that\ninternational pressure on the military\njunta will have any effect.\nAfter gaining independence from the\nBritish Empire in 1948 Burma was a\nparliamentary democracy. There was\nethnic strife from the start; Burma has\naround 136 different ethnic groups.\nDemocracy survived until 1962 when\nGeneral Ne Win held power until\n1988. Throughout this period, there\nwere no free elections, and freedom\nof expression and association were\nalmost entirely denied. With the 1988\nprotests General Ne Win resigned and\nthe military junta took over proper.\nWithout being too vague, things have\ncontinued much the same as they have\nfrom 1962 to this day. During the 1988\nprotests, Aung San Suu Kyi rose to\nprominence as the leader of the main\nopposition party, the National League\nfor Democracy (NLD). When the military junta held elections in 1990 she\ngained 82 percent of the vote. However\nthe military ignored the results of the\nelections and tightened their grip on\npower. It was the military junta that\nchanged the name from Burma to Myanmar \u2013 something that the U.S. and\nU.K. do not recognize.\n90 percent of the Burmese popula-tiom are actively practicing Buddhists.\nAs I mentioned early the most likely\ncause of the protests is economic. The\nBurmese people are frustrated that the\nmilitary junta has failed to provide basic services. While it spends 40 percent\nof it\u2019s budget on the military less than\n0.5 percent of GDP goes into education and, and despite being one of the\nmost HIV-infected Asian countries, it\nspends only 0.17 percent of GDP on\nhealthcare. Human rights abuses are\nwidespread and include the following\nForced labour. The Red Cross says\nthat there are about 90 prison and labour camps in the country.\nSexual violence. The military\u2019s use of\nsexual violence has increased dramati-cally. Refugees International says that\nrape is systemically used against ethnic\ncommunities.\nChild Soldiers. Burma has the largest\nnumber of child soldiers (under the age\nof 18). Human Rights Watch said that\nthere were about 70,000 child soldiers\nin 2002, most of them forcibly recruit-ed.\nMonks have taken to the streets in protest of the Military junta which has run the country into economic ruin\nKadhim Shubber\nKadhim Shubber\nIn Myanmar, there is a monastery in\nevery village and even those who are\nnot career monks have probably spent\na short time in their lives in a Monastery. There are around 500,000 monks\nin Burma and they are completely reliant on the handouts of the people.\nDonating to a monk earns you spiritual\ncredit and so the refusal of a monk to\naccept a handout is essentially denying\nyou spiritual advancement. Therefore\nthe decision of the monks to refuse\nall handouts from the military was\nextremely powerful \u2013 remember the\nmilitary is also devoutly Buddhist. The\nmonks have a history of political activism stretching back to the 19th century\nmonarchy of Burma. They then acted\nas intermediaries between monarchy\nand public and in the last 100 years\nthey have been at the forefront of protest against unpopular authorities such\nas the British and the military junta.\nHowever, it is always good to remember that no dictatorship survives\nwithout the consent of a significant\nproportion of the population.\nThe political week summarised very quickly\ntry\u2019s transport system on the day that\nEurostar trains began running from\nLondon\u2019s refurbished St Pancras Station. The substantial engineering\nproject will shave 20 minutes off the\naverage London to Paris journey time.\nCombating terrorism in the UK\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown announced new security measures for\nBritain\u2019s potential key infrastructure\ntargets including airports, railway stations and hospitals against physical\nterrorist attack. It comes months after\na Jeep ploughed into Glasgow Airport,\ncausing a large fireball.

And why\nnot? Halo 2 kept gamers enthralled for\na few years after its release and it\u2019s a\ngiven that the third son will carry on\nthe proud tradition, perhaps with the\nbanner held higher.\nI\u2019ve only been playing the multiplayer for a couple of weeks now but\nI concur with Robin Andrews about\nthe experience. It\u2019s simply delicious\ndespite Live being largely populated\nby whining prepubescent little snots.\nThen there are the Pop Idol wannabes;\nto put it simply they should be drug\nout into the street and shot. Many,\nmany times. It\u2019s a godsend that Halo 3\noffers the all-important mute function:\nsimply choose the boisterous buffoon\nfrom the scoreboard and then hit X to\nmute him forever. So what if he\u2019s formulating the winning strategy or if he\nneeds backup... even in defeat you can\nbe happy.\nHowever, bar these myriad offenders,\nsometimes magic just happens. Moving tightly as a group of four, you rush\nthe enemy head-on. You know they\u2019re\nblatantly going to grenade you as they\nscramble against your assault. However they realise something important:\nthe team count is usually five. As two\nfall dead where they stand and a telltale\nreport rings throughout the causeway,\nthe objective of your rush becomes\napparent. The stragglers make a mad\ndash to safety as they\u2019re gunned down.\nThe exciting thing is, you can be on the\nreceiving end just as easily.\nNow with the Halo fever it\u2019s often\neasy to forget that there are actually\nother games out there. This past week\nsaw the release of games like Assassin\u2019s\nCreed and Call of Duty 4; both seem to\nbe very enticing games so expect some\nfeature articles at a Felix near you. Old\nschool adventuring gets a kick up it\u2019s\nmorbidly decaying backside with the\nrelease of Uncharted: Drake\u2019s Fortune.\nI\u2019m quite a fan of Naughty Dog - with\nthe Jak trilogy constituting some of my\nall-time favourite games. However, as\nmany of you are aware... all this will\npale in comparison to what will be\nhappening today.\nYes, the 16th of November marks\nthe day that a proper Mario game becomes unleashed on a hapless popula-tion. Children will scream. Parents will\ntear their hair out. And the sound of a\nthousand Wiimotes crying out in joy\nwill ring throughout the globe. Or you\nknow, lots of people will buy it and play\nhappily, yay.\nNow while I\u2019m really interested in\ngetting Super Mario Galaxy, I\u2019m sort of\ntorn between a Wii and an Xbox 360.\nMy birthday just whizzed by a day ago\nand I\u2019m still pondering which one to\nget... Mario or Masterchief.\nBah. One PS3 and a copy of Metal\nGear Solid 4 and I\u2019ll be content. It\u2019s too\nbad that that\u2019s ages away...\nThis\nWeek\nOne Spartan, twice shot\nOh, hai! I can pwnz you now?\nA sniper\u2019s best friend\nBOOM, headshot! Say what about insecurity?\nRobin Andrews whips out his sniper rifle and people die. Screaming. The noobs\nI\u2019m part of an ongoing war. A highly-charged, horrifically violent conflict\nthat has left many people scarred for\nlife. Some of us have risen through the\nranks to stand above the metaphorical\nbase layer below, watching as humanity fights itself in a spiral of destruction\n\u2013 silently observing man\u2019s inhumanity\nto man.\nAnd, like any global conflict, this one\nis always highly political.\n\u2018Red team rules. Blue team is going\ndown!\u2019 blares one, his virtual finger\npointing aggressively across the map.\nHis comrades in arms line up against\nthe grey, Forerunner structure, already\nplanning which weapon or vehicle they\nare going to pinch first. Suddenly, a\ntransmission is received from the other\nside of the grassy, hilly landscape.\n\u2018Red team can suck it,\u2019 a disembodied\nvoice replies. The red team shout multiple expletives back, most of them with\nstrong American accents. Yet someone\nremains quiet \u2013 the Commander, who\ngrabs his sniper rifle and walks calmly\ndown the left ramp. \u2018Would everyone\njust be quiet and get on with it?\u2019 He\nis heard sighing, before he continues\nhis journey out into the wilderness of\nValhalla. Some of his allies are clearly\nsurprised by his distinctly different\naccent.\n\u2018Hey guys, he\u2019s British!\u2019 exclaims one.\nAnother reads out his gamertag \u2013 several times, in fact \u2013 before falling silent\nagain. Someone from the opposing side\npoints out that this particular gamer\nshould go back to England and drink\nsome more tea, to which he calmly explains he is already living there. And\nthat tea isn\u2019t really his thing. After this\nhighly intellectual political debate,\nwhich included reasons why certain\npeople should \u2018turn down the retardation\u2019, a few vehicles begin to move,\nseveral bullets are fired, and soon\nenough the war of stupidity breaks out\ninto a war of bul-lets, explosions,\nand warthogs.\nWelcome to the\nworld of Halo 3\u2019s\nmultiplayer.\nHalo 2\u2019s multiplayer was by all\naccounts a huge\nsuccess, one which\nhas strongly influenced many other\ngames in its genre.\nIts fan base was\nenormous, and\nall were looking\nforward to Halo\n3, nervously wondering whether or\nnot its multiplayer\nwould exceed the\nhighest of their ex-pectations. I was\none of them. After\ncompleting the\ncampaign mode\nseveral times over \u2013 seriously people,\nit really is that stunning \u2013 I leapt into\nthe multiplayer.\nTo be honest with you \u2013 and to show\noff a bit \u2013 I was pretty good at Halo 2.\nI was a dedicated online gamer then,\nand I am even more so today. After finishing the fight with the Master Chief,\nI took my online avatar \u2013 Shadowblade9876 (yes, that was originally from\nan MMORPG and no there aren\u2019t 9,876\nof us) \u2013 once again to the forefront of\nthe world\u2019s largest online conflict.\nThe game starts you off with an obligatory training session, to make sure\nyou know how to aim a gun at someone who is trying to do precisely the\nsame thing. It was hilarious \u2013 everyone\nelse could barely reload before getting\nm\u00eal\u00e9ed in the back of the head. Another hapless soul picked up a beam rifle\n\u2013 the Covenant version of the sniper\nrifle \u2013 and attempted to use it to embarrassing effect. Being a sniper my-self, I felt his ignorance with a\nscoped weapon\nhad to be pun-ished. A Ghost,\na small Covenant vehicle,\nploughed into\nhim soon after-wards. The game\nkindly reminded\nme I was awarded the \u201cSplatter\u201d\nmedal just as his\nlistless body impacted the snow,\ncausing a small\nplume to form.\nAfter the\nmatch ended, the\ngame decided to\npromote me to\nan Apprentice,\nthe lowest rank\npossible in the\ngame. A new addition to the multiplayer, people can\nnow advance in virtual military rank\nby gaining experience points for doing particularly well in certain engage-ments. Not only this, but you are also\ngiven Skill Points in Ranked Matches,\nwhich shows people your relative skill\nlevel in relation to everyone else play-ing. If you succeed in raising both of\nthese stats, you can ascend through\nthe ranks.\nThis little addition happened to make\nHalo 3 more addictive than initially\nthought. Upon entering my first Social\nSlayer match \u2013 basically a team deathmatch \u2013 I was laughed at by a Lieutenant, someone who had been playing\nthe multiplayer much more than I had\nby that point. He kindly informed me\nthat I was a n00b, and stood very little chance of winning. Of course this\nwas not actually what he said \u2013 most\nof it was far too vulgar to print in this\nhigh-brow publication. Nevertheless, I\nYour two best friends: left hand... ...and right hand\nWar is hell... and utterly brown as the next generation of consoles will have you believe. Reality is over-rated, isn\u2019t it?\n\n"

This week Felix has advice on how to make sure you get it back\nNigel Cooke\nStudent Advisor\nAt the advice centre, one of the most\nfrequent enquiries we receive is to do\nwith housing rights. Within this broad\ntopic, by far the most popular enquiry\nis to do with landlords keeping a student\u2019s deposit unfairly. So, how can you\nget it back? The IAC helps you build\nup an argument and in some cases this\nmay go to the small claims court.\nThe Tenancy Deposit Scheme has\nnow been up and running since April\n2007 so anyone who has moved into\na property after this date, with an assured shorthold tenancy, their landlord should be protecting their deposit through a government approved\nscheme.\nIf a landlord chooses not to do this\nand is reported then it is possible that\nthe tenant could be awarded 3 times\nthe amount of deposit they have paid.\nSo what does all this mean for the average private student tenant? Well, hope-fully, this article will answer some of\nyour questions.\nLandlords\u2019 are able to choose from\ntwo types of scheme, one is a single-custodial scheme. This is where the\nlandlord pays the full amount of the\ndeposit into the scheme. At the end\nof the tenancy, and if both parties\nagree to the amount of money being\npaid back, the scheme will refund the\nagreed amount to the tenant. If there is\na disagreement, then a dispute resolution service will step in at no extra cost\nto solve the disagreement.\nThe second type of scheme is an\ninsurance-based scheme, where the\ntenant pays a security deposit to the\nlandlord but in this case the landlord\nretains the deposit and pays a premium\nto the scheme. If there is a dispute, the\nlandlord will legally have to hand over\nthe full deposit to the scheme until the\nsituation is resolved. If the landlord\ndoesn\u2019t comply and a decision is made\nin favour of the tenant, then the insurance payments will cover this.\nThese schemes are all run by private\ncompanies but the key difference from\nthe way deposits were held in the past\nis that there is now an independent\ndispute resolution service. In the past,\nit could take weeks of arguing with a\nlandlord before a court case was taken\nto a small claims court. This could often be costly and intimidating for a student to initiate. The great thing about\nthe schemes nowadays is that there is\nno need to take disputes to the small\nclaims court.\nThose of you who have moved into\nprivate properties need to ask your\nlandlord if they have put your deposit\ninto a scheme and request proof of this.\nThe Information and Advice Centre\nhas kindly drawn up some important\npoints for you to keep in mind when\nsigning an assured shorthold tenancy\nafter 6th April 2007:\n1. Insist on your landlord drawing up\nan inventory. This is a piece of paper\nwhich will have the condition of everything in the property on the date you\nmove in. It will make it easier to decide\nthe condition of furniture and the like\nwhen you move out.\n2. Ensure that your landlord is part of\nthe scheme and don\u2019t take any excuse\nor explanation as to why they are not.\nIf you have questions or are not sure\nwhether your landlord should be part\nof the scheme please contact The Information and Advice Centre.\n3. In the scheme, when the landlord\nand tenant are agreed on the amount\nto be paid to the tenant, this must be\npaid back within 10 days. This is the\nsame if there is a dispute and a decision has been made. If a landlord fails\nto comply with this rule then further\naction can be taken.\n4. For any assured shorthold tenancy\nthat is signed before April 6th 2007, the\ntenancy deposit scheme will not apply.\nIt is only those assured shorthold tenancies that are signed after this date\nthat will be part of the scheme.\nThis scheme is a massive change to\nthe way that landlords used to conduct\ntheir business in the past. The scheme\nmay be able to have a massive impact\non students as tenants, however this\nwill mean nothing if students are not\naware of the scheme so I would ask anyone reading this to pass the word on\nor show people this article if you feel\nyour landlord is not protecting your\ndeposit.\nPlease contact the IAC for further\nadvice by emailing Nigel Cooke\non advice@imperial.ac.uk\nTaking your landlord to court can be quite daunting\nAn inventory can stop your landlord from screwing you over\nChallenge the Sabbs\nChallenge the Sabbs\nRound 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2\nRound 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2\nRound 2 is coming: Jousting on bicycles.\nSabbs vs. RAG.
