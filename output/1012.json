    "content": "News\nComputing's24 Hour Crusader\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAMA student is challenging his\ndepartment in an attempt to\nobtain round the clock computing access. Manor Askenazi, a fourth year computing student is\ncirculating a petition in favour of\n24-hour terminal access for 3rd and 4th year undergraduates. Mr\nAskenazi has already collected a hundred signatories for his\npetition and has received the\nsupport of Departmental Representative Caroline Demian.\nHowever, Professor Tom\nMaibaum, Head of the\nDepartment of Computing, has\nobjected to Askenazi's suggestion\non security grounds.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Professor Maibaum described the\nproposed unsupervised access to\ncomputing labs as a 'very serious\nsecurity risk'.\nHe also questioned the\nwisdom of allowing students to\nwork all hours of the day and\nnight in front of a terminal. \"It is\nnot a good form in which to\nstudy, nor is it good for their\nhealth.\"\nIn reply, Mr Askenazi\nretorted, \"If we have not learned\nto avoid self-destructive behaviour by now, College will not be\nthe one to teach us.\"\nAddressing the security\nissue, Mr Askenazi pointed out\nthat two sets of swipe-card doors\nrestricted access to the\ncomputing facilities, in addition\nto the steel cabling which\nim mobil is es all of the computing\nequipment.\nCurrently, 24-hour access to\ncomputing terminals is not\navailable to any Imperial\nundergraduate. However, in\nmany more 'enlightened'\nuniversities some form of round\nthe clock access have been\nestablished for some time.\nCertain students have been\ngranted 'out of hours' access to\ncomplete project work or in\nother unusual circumstances, but\nMr Askenazi complains that\nsuch exceptions to the rules are\n'inconsistent and unreliable'.\nSecurity Walk Gives Cause For Hope\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nImperial College Security Staff\nhave been raising money for a charity walk.\nThe 'Cause For Hope'\nAppeal is raising funds to set up\na centre for lung cancer research\nin Liverpool. It is to be a memorial to the popular TV entertainer Roy Castle, who died\nin September after a long battle\nagainst lung cancer.\nThe four-week 'Walk of\nHope' by two security officers, at\nthe University of Liverpool,\nwhich started in Edinburgh is\ndue to arrive at College today.\nThe officers, Ray Pullen and\nJohn Collins, requested the\nsupport of their colleagues in 22\nother universities to achieve\ntheir target of \u00a312,000.\nGraham Inniss, Imperial's security coordinator, said: \"This\nis a cause we hope people will dig\ninto their pockets and support...\nour target was \u00a3500 but we hope\nto raise nearer \u00a31000. We're very\nmuch indebted to the RAG office\n[for their help], and we're proud\nof our staff for their work.\"\nSpeaking to FELIX, Ian\nRobertson, Rag Chair, said that\nthere would be collection\nbuckets around College, at the\nRag bash in the evening, and also\nat the Pub Crawl.\nThe walkers will be going to\nCollege via Knightsbridge,\naccompanied by Rag collectors,\nand presentation of the proceeds\nis to take place in the Solar\nRoom at 170 Queen's Gate on\nMonday morning.\nLiz Carr of the Press Office,\nwho has been public ising the\nevent, said: \"Security have been\nwonderful, and Rag have been\nvery good as well... it's something that's touched a lot of\npeople, and has become a popular cause to support.\"\nThe walkers are due to leave\nImperial College on Monday for\nthe London School of Economics. They will complete their\n600-mile trek at City University\non Tuesday.\nChemistry To Lose Lecture Theatres\nBY ANDREW SMITH\nImperial College's Department\nof Chemistry, arguably the\ncountry's leading chemistry\ndepartment, will be without\ndedicated lecture theatres if the\nnew Basic Medical Sciences\n(BMS) building goes ahead.\nFELIX has learnt that their\npresent facilities are due to be\ndemolished in July of next year,\nwith no funding available for\nreplacements.\nDr Brian Levitt, Chemistry's Director of Undergraduate\nStudies, has told FELIX that he\nhas 'no idea what the solution\nwould be' to the lack of lecture\ntheatres. He confirmed that\nalthough original plans had\nfor seen three new lecture\ntheatres over the present Lyon\nPlayfair Library, funding\npressures has forced the shelving\nof two of these.\nDr Levitt stressed the\ndifficult situation that Chemistry\nis in, having already publicised a new four year course, it is now\nfinding itself without theatres.\nQuestions have been raised as to\nwhether this will put off future\nstudents from applying for the\ncourse.\nMr Ian Caldwell, Director of\nEstates, has confirmed that the\nHigher Education Funding\nCouncil of England (HEFCE),\nwill not fund the building of new\ntheatres at Imperial when others\nremain empty for significant\nperiods of time. Mr Caldwell\nattempted to calm fears, saying\nthat studies were in progress as\nto the usage of all the College's lecture theatres.\nHe confirmed that central\ncoordination of theatres is being\nconsidered, with Chemistry and\nBiochemistry students possibly\nhaving to be lectured in other\ndepartments.\nOne option under consideration is the insertion of raked\nseats into the Union Concert\nHall to be available both for\nlectures during the day and the\ncinema in the evening.\nDr Levitt has said that his\ndepartment is 'making representations at all levels' to resolve\nthe situation. He sarcastically\ncommented that, \"all this is a brilliant example of planning\".\nWith the proposed move of\nalmost a thousand students to\nthe BMS building, the extent of\nprovision for their accommodation and recreational\nfacilities is not known. Mr\nCaldwell has said that he hopes\nthe development of additional\naccommodation will pro cede in\nparallel to the development of\nteaching facilities.\nOptions being discussed are\nthe building of residences over\nboth the Sports Centre and the\ntennis courts beside Linstead.\nAlso on the cards is the renovation of the parts of Beit Quad\nwhich will be vacated by the\nBiology Department.\nEH FELIX I8I10 U94 "

    "content": "Standby\nin the rye ^ a well connected revolution\nIt looks like the Tate Gallery are\nexpecting their exhibition of\npictures by the 19th century\nAmerican artist James McNeill\nWhistler to be the big artistic\nattraction of the next few months.\nThe ticket booth arrangements\noutside on the lawn are certainly\nset up with large crowds in mind.\nThe exhibition itself features over\n200 of the artist's works and has\nbeen elaborately prepared.\nWhistler was very fussy about the\npresentation of his paintings and\nat the Tate entire rooms have\nbeen decorated in gold and\nPrussian blue.\nThe range of pictures covers\nWhistler's whole career. He began\nto make his name in the 1 850s with a series of detailed etchings\ndepicting working-class life on the\nbanks of the Thames. Over the\nnext decade realism became less\nimportant to him as he explored\ncomposition and mood. It's with\nthe culmination of this trend, the\ngorgeous and atmospheric\nNocturnes of the 1870s, that the\nexhibition really takes off.\nIn 1 877 the famous\n'Nocturne in Black and Gold: The\nFalling Rocket' became the subject\nof a notorious libel trial: Whistler\nsued the influential art critic John\nRuskin, who had accused him of\n\"flinging a pot of paint in the\npublic's face\". When the judge\nwanted to know if Whistler really\nasked to be paid 200 guineas for\ntwo days' labour, Whistler replied,\n\"No. I ask it for the knowledge I have gained in the work of a lifetime.\" He won his case, and\nwas awarded damages of a farthing.\nMost of the Nocturnes are\nLondon scenes, but one of the best\nis of St Mark's in Venice. It's a haunting depiction of a building\nthat can all too often turn out\nlooking like a Baroque jelly mould\nor heap of profit e roles. These\nremarkable paintings don't reproduce well, and really need to\nbe seen in the original.\nAfter the Nocturnes, much of\nwhat follows is an anticlimax. But\nthere are a couple of beautiful\nportraits in later rooms. An\n'Arrangement in Grey and\nMother-of-Pearl' is a silvery\ndepiction of the artist's sister-in-law. There's also one of Lady\nArchibald Campbell, which her\nrelatives objected to on the\ngrounds that it made her look like\n\"a street walker\". There was too\nmuch ankle! 0\nWW\nA film's value is not defined by its\ndirector, stars, philosophy or\nhistorical foundation but by whether\nits audience enjoys it. For all of the\nthought in Trois Couleurs Rouge\nby the end you get the feeling that\nit has become driven by cleverness\nand not by emotion.\nSet in Switzerland, the film\nshows us the image of modern\nEurope. Naturally beautiful, well\nconnected, rich, secular and aryan,\nthe country is just like the heroine.\nValentine (Irene Jacob) is a model,\nwhose face sells chewing gum from\na giant hoarding. Her boyfriend is\naway in England and they can only\ntalk on the phone.\nAs a concept which encourages\nthe mental divorce and dependence\nat the same time, the telephone is a totem which runs throughout the\nfilm. We rush upstairs for it and it\ncuts out before we get there. It\nprovides anonymity for anger, erotic\nfr is son for those who manage to\nbreak into its privacy and ultimately\na wall to hide behind when face to\nface becomes snarl to bite. In a film\nsupposedly about brotherhood, the\nphone is the biggest actor.\nWhen she runs over a dog,\nValentine takes it back to its owner.\nSo while her boyfriend can only get\nthe answerphone, she is living a real life, meeting someone strange.\nThe dog's owner is a retired and\nnameless judge (Jean-Louis\nTrintignant). A bitter old man, he\ngets his kicks listening into the\nneighbours' phone calls, knowing\nevery airborne secret and predicting\nwhat will become. Just as\nValentine's disgust is turned to\nhelplessness so their relationship\ngrows into something uneasily like\nlove. And this is where 'Three\nColours Red' begins its over thought spiral downwards. Age is the only\nbarrier between them but in the\nmodern brotherhood that is\nenough. Valentine is the Judge's salvation and he is sacrificed to\ncinematic philosophy. In a film so\nfull of forced parallels it could pass\nfor an aerial photograph of\nClapham Junction, Auguste, a young trainee magistrate, takes up\nthe older man's role and love. Yet\nit's a poor deal for Valentine, not\nleast because Auguste is dull as\nwell as being a lawyer.\nAt the end 'Three Colours Red'\ndegenerates as the pressure of\nloose ends from three films is left\nunsolved and hurriedly knotted\ntogether in a skein of threads. Just\nas in the last scene Valentine the\nchewing gum icon mirrors and\ncheapens Valentine the survivor, so\n'Three Colours Red' becomes a pale\nreflection of what made it\nwatch able. At heart love does not\nrecognise age and audiences will\nfeel cheated when their emotional\nbonds are transplanted from real\nheroes to flat lining doppelg d ngers. In Final Combination Michael\nMadsen (the psychopathic Mr\nBlonde from Reservoir Dogs) plays\nLA cop Matt Dickson. He's hunting\nRichard Welton, a killer boxer\nplayed by Gary Stretch. Dickson is\nasthmatic and not exactly sylph-like.\nNevertheless two bone-crunching\nencounters with Welton leave him\neach time with nothing more than a sticking-plaster above his right\neyebrow.\nThis is a run-of-the-mill thriller,\nwith three or four suspenseful\nmoments. Welton's kinky obsession\nwith sex phone lines looks promising\nbut remains disappointingly\nundeveloped. The love interest is\nLisa Sonet, aka Denise Huxtable\nfrom the Cosby show, ex-Mrs Lenny\nKravitz etc. There's lots of slugging\n('man to man' of course), some\nshooting, a car chase, and ... er,\nthat's it.\nActing is all that Jamie (Jennifer\nRubin) wants to do in the\nPlaymaker. Her current soap\nopera job is at a standstill, she has\na drink problem, low self\nconfidence and a useless agent; she\nis desperate for a big leading role.\nWhen she finally gets an audition\nfor the role for a new film she turns\nto acting coach, Ross Talbert (Colin\nFirth) for some pre-audition\ntraining. However Talbert's teaching\nmethods are totally unconventional.\nHe plays psychological games with\nthe intention of bringing out Jamie's true potential. Then, in a turnaround,\nthe roles are reversed and Jamie\nbecomes the initiator, commanding\neach action. The acting lessons\nhave obviously been very effective.\nUp to this point in the story I was quite enthralled with the\npsychological games, though\nsometimes being on the slightly\nsadistic side, but from then on the\nplot became really quite silly. It\nended up a bit of a farce. 0\nWM FELIX I8I)0 U94 "

Yes, at last, a summer late,\nsomeone has lit a barbeque and the veggie burgers are\ngrilling nicely. In the meantime Phoenix, the Arts\nMagazine of Imperial College, has come out too...\nThis Monday the college will be 'swamped' by 1000 fiery Phoenices. That\nour arts magazine is limited to one copy per seven students may seem\nunfair but quantity is rarely a constituent of Quality. The few artistic\nsouls who have added to this years issue have all produced decent work -occasionally remarkably so - and the randomly selected snippets here\nonly hint at what's on offer. Check out a copy for the big picture.\nWe, as editors, tried to bring the word 'Art' back to the fore and to a degree I think we've succeeded. Our theme (that of the mythical birds\nlife-cycle) revealed some interesting angles to submitted work and in the\nmain I think our textual experiments were worthwhile. Having gone on to\nedit a weekly publication not a FELIX throw away from here, I can verify\nthat the annual sister experience is a much mellower one. And somehow\nmore satisfying, in that one can always delude oneself into believing that\nmaybe a few people will keep a copy of Phoenix around with them, that it\nisn't completely disposable. For this reason, Phoenix is available (to\nthose darlings desperate to ensure they own one of those 1000 issues) from\nthe FELIX office today, Friday. General release is Monday morning.\n\"They're below the average size, she said.\n\"You're beautiful.\" she said.\n\"Not so bad yourself\" she said,\nbut looked at the floor.

    "content": "Feature\nThe Imperial College Twilight Zone\nThere are paranormal forces at work in\nImperial College! No, I'm not talking about\nthe staff. I mean The Unexplained (my\nlecture notes?).\nLet's start with my door. Strange forces\nare at work. If I wrench my door open and put\na large heavy bin in the way, do you think it\nstays open? Remember, this is a Hall door.\nOkay, logical progression - what do y 'think\nhappens if I need to close my door? If I 've\nsomehow managed to pick a sexy young male\n(what, at IC?) and want a bit of privacy, does\nthe door stay shut? That's asking TOO MUCH, isn't it? These forces extend to the\nkitchen, where the Laws of Hall-Physics state\nthat an oven (or fridge) door is always open\nwhen you want it to be closed, and vice versa.\nOvens also have the alarming habit of turning\nthemselves off. You walk in starving after a particularly nasty lecture, switch on the oven\n- with a note on it saying \"please do not turn\nthis oven off and what happens? After\nfinally managing to persuade the fridge door\nto open and staggering back with some food,\nyou find the oven you were trying to preheat\nis stone cold. No-one turned it off - it just\nhappened.\nA new life force has evolved in our\nkitchen sink. The biologists have concluded\nthat it is a new sentient rapidly breeding form\nunion MI on\nof rice. Leave just one grain of this in the sink\novernight, and by the next morning the\nplug hole will be blocked. Something as\nsimple as washing-up water? No - every\nsingle person in hall who has ever cooked rice\nclaims that they tip their left-over rice into\nthe bin before commencing the washing-up.\nSo where is it coming from?\n\"Chaos theory says the flap of a butterfly's wing in Miami could\ncause a whirlwind over Japan.\nWell, if this is true, God alone\nknows what the whirlpool in our\nbath could do...\"\nConsider now some thermodynamics -the central heating. If you are going out for\nthe day, never ever leave your room without\nopening the window first. Otherwise you will\nreturn from a hard day's shopping/night's drinking only to find that you have crossed\nover into another dimension and have become\nentrapped in the Sahara desert.\nYou have to be careful just stepping\ninto the bathroom. Chaos theory says the flap\nof a butterfly's wing in Miami could cause a whirlwind over Japan. Well, if this is true,\nGod alone knows what the whirlpool in our\nbath could do. World, beware!\nAnd there's more. Hall is haunted - it\nmust be. Why else would you step into a descending lift, only to go up to a level where\nno-one is waiting, then back to the start\nwhere the lift doors jam open as the lift fills\nwith a sudden chill? The only rational\nexplanation is that the lift stopped to collect\nthe ghosts of some students from the top\nfloor. Even more worrying is the number of\ntimes someone has run to answer a ringing\nphone, only to discover that THERE IS NOONE ON THE OTHER END! Must be a warning from the spirit world...\nScariest of all, though, has to be the fact\nthat anything brought into the hall from\noutside suddenly picks up the habits of the\nthings already here. Sainsbury's appears to be\na fairly normal place. Food from Sainsbury's appears to be safe - yet, bring it back to hall,\nput it in the fridge, and it develops Hall\nHabits. Food spontaneously moves around\nand has even been known to vanish\ncompletely, reappearing a few days later. The\nmind boggles.\nIf you have observed any similar,\nshocking occurrences, send them to Astro,\ncare of FELIX. WE DEMAND TO KNOW\nTHE TRUTH!\nHieet:ing\ning\nto be held Today, 1:00pm. Venue: Union Lounge, Union Building, Beit Quad.\nThis will include the second reading of the new constitution, disCUSS\nFriday night entrance fees to the Union and any motions\ngiven to the president beforehand.\nall welcome\nI8I10 U94 FELIX MM\n\n"

Fine, I reply. Just give me the address of a needy Rwandan and I 'll send off this inedible\nmound in the morning. Better still, I 'll post it to\nthe person responsible for proverbs and\nadages. And I hope he or she chokes on it.\n\"Give me the\naddress of a needy\nRwandan...\"\nLet's face it, why do we bother? Have you\never had a conversation where the timely\ninsertion of make hay while the sun shines has\nadded some much-needed colour? Maybe on\nfirst hearing it did, but certainly not now. In\nfact, only slightly less tedious than the grass-court version, is Proverb Tennis. Beware of the\nelderly when you indulge in Proverb Tennis\nbecause they are the Monica Seles' of this\nparticular verbal joust. As I climbed up to\nchange Mrs Miggins' bulb, I ask her to hold the\nladder steady.\n\"Many hands make light work\" I say with\nsome considerable inspiration. Not wanting to\nbudge from the comfy chair, she looks up.\n\"Too many cooks spoil the broth\" she\nlashes down the line. I grit my teeth. Where are\nthe deranged Steffi Graf fans when you need\nthem?\nThe only way to win in Proverb Tennis is\nto stop playing the game. As Mrs Miggins\nserves \"A stitch in time...\", return to her feet,\n\"... except at the Barts A& E.\" And when she lobs\nwith \"Love will conquer all...\", soar to the\nheights of \"... except in tennis.\"\n\"It only takes a second to score...\"\nThe new attempts at proverbs are just as\nbad. When Lenny Henry described something\nas \"a bit British Telecom\", did he mean out of\norder, or a shining Tory example of\nprivatisation as the source of increased\nconsumer satisfaction? And what was Brian\nClough talking about when he said 'It only\ntakes a second to score'? More like an evening\nof six pints, getting your mate to ask her mate\nand countless embarrassed grins.\nGod help the misguided fool who tries to\nstrike up conversation with \"Does this glass\nlook half empty or half full to you?\"\n\"Definitely empty\" I will say as I pour it\nover his unoriginal little head.\nRahul\nIt's sad, but the structure of the world is such\nthat to get your voice heard by anyone in power\nin this great democracy, drastic measures are\nrequired. At one time peaceful protests may\nhave been enough to achieve something; but I remember the miners' strike of 1 985. That was\npeaceful ish, that achieved nothing. The last\nanti-criminal justice bill demonstration will not\ndo anything to prevent the criminal justice bill.\nDo these people honestly think their opinion\ncounts for anything with Mr Major? If he wants\nto stop hunt saboteurs and travellers from their\npierced nipple d excesses, and r avers from their\ndrug crazed abandon, it is not an issue of\nwhether this is an infringement of human rights.\nIt is all about the appeasement of the land\nowning gentry, and the easily disgusted anal\nenglish, with their satellite dishes and golf club\naspirations. This is a tory Prime Minister - do the\nprotesters think he gives an anal wart about\ndemocracy? They must be mad.\nThe only way to change people's lives, the\nonly way to get your voice heard in the world is\nto kill. To kill and bomb and shoot and maim.\nFrom taking the beatings of the B specials on\nthe streets of Belfast in the civil rights marches\nof 1969, to the Downing Street negotiating\ntable in 1994. A long hard struggle, but a victory. One made possible through atrocities\nlike Warrenpoinf, and Enniskillen, the Guildford\npub bombings, cross border shootings of soldiers\non checkpoints, and dead children on the streets\nof English cities. These are the lengths it is\nnecessary to go to change your world. The piles\nof severed arms from the Vietnamese children\nwho had been vaccinated by the american army\nlying in the middle of the village as a reminder\nfrom the Viet Cong to anyone in doubt of their\nmotivation. That is commitment. That is drive. If you want to change the world, buy a gun. If you\nwant to show everyone what a caring and\ncompassionate civil libertarian you are, stay in\nbed. The criminal justice bill will be there long\nafter you, and deservedly so. I for one don't give\na damn about travellers or hunt saboteurs.

    "content": "Standby\n^ nb trips\nWhen was the last time you\nstopped to look at the city's face?\nReally looked, I mean, not just a hurried, nervous glance around as\nyou rush for the tube or bus.\nLondon is a concrete menagerie\nthat invites you to gasp at its\ngaudy and glorious inhabitants\nand wallow in its huge and\nteeming vibrancy. The streets may\ntaste of tail backs and tedium but\nthrills could be around the very\nnext corner, and there's always\nsomething more to do,\nsomewhere else to be...\nMost of the time though\nthings happen too fast. It's only\nlate at night, when the city's fevered breath steadies and slows\n- a giant on the edge of fretful\nsleep - that we have time to see\nthings clearly. Everyday objects\nassume a moon-drenched grace\nand beauty, a density impossible\nin the grey light of day.\nTake the humble London bus:\neven during the day, it's by far the\nmost interesting way to travel. The\npeople seem less tense than on\nthe tube, more inclined to talk\ninstead of bury their heads in the\npaper, and of course you get a much better view. But at night the\nbuses come into their own,\ntransformed by midnight magic\ninto mobile mad-houses: fertile\nbreeding grounds for the bad, the\nsad and the merely dangerous to\nsit next to. And in the lees of the\nnight, all roads lead to Trafalgar.\nBands of bliss ed out c lubbers and bored tourists up way past\ntheir bed-time roam the Square,\nall trying with increasing\ndesperation to find the right stop\nfor their night-bus, all of them\nseemingly intent on getting in your\nway. When you finally fight past\nthem it's usually just in time to see\nyour bus receding into the\ndistance. Never mind, there'll be\nanother one along in an hour...\nBesides, there's so much to\ndo while you wait: you can talk to\nthe drunks and ignore the\nbeggars; imagine striking up a conversation with the beautiful\nwoman standing next to you (is\nshe waiting for the same bus as\nyou?); or just breath in the night\nair under the watchful stare of old\nNelson, your thoughts coiling in\nupon themselves. Then, some time\nlater (minutes? hours? It's difficult\nto tell) the bus - your bus - pulls\nmajestically into the square, and\nno chariot of the gods could be\nmore welcome. You pay the fare,\nfind a seat, and make yourself\ncomfortable. Ready to begin your\nlong day's journey into night. Q another last waltz; posthumous and live\nI didn't want to eu log is e. But, after\nlistening to the posthumous album\nfrom Nirvana, Unplugged in new\nyork, I'm afraid that it's impossible\nnot to. This is Nirvana as you've\nnever heard them before (and sadly\nwill never hear them again) - their\nrawness, their passion and most\ntellingly of all, the sheer beauty of\nKurt Cobain's songs all augmented\nby the acoustic format.\n'About a girl', 'Come as you\nare', 'All apologies', 'Dumb', 'Polly',\nall are gentle yet probing, soft yet\nincisive. We are treated to an\nimpromptu solo rendition of\n'Pennyroyal tea' from Cobain and I defy it not to send shivers up your\nspine.\nBut this album serves also to\nir re futa bly prove the magnificence\nof Nirvana as performers. Witness\nthe cover versions; the Vaselines'\n'Jesus don't want me for a sunbeam' (complete with Krist\nNovoselic on accordion), Bowie's 'The man who sold the world', a trio of 1983 Meat Puppet jewels,\nand ending with Leadbelly's 'Where\ndid you sleep last night?'. Listen to\nthem, close your eyes, and let their\nhaunting qualities help you to\nrealise what that old clich e 'making\na song your own' really means.\nIt's ironic that eMpty TV, the\ncorporate behemoth that controls\nthe musical tastes of America,\nshould serve us with Nirvana's farewell, especially when the song\nthat broke them, 'Smells like teen\nspirit', was directed straight at the\neMpty TV generation. But then it\nprobably says more about Kurt\nCobain's punk ethics that he should\nchoose to use such an establishment to show the public what his\nsongs were really worth and to hint\nat the direction he was heading for,\nif only the inevitable had not\nhappened. Yes, a corporate whore\nwho had the last laugh...(9)\nThe Black Crowes may have\nresorted to cheap and tacky\npromotional stunts with the sleeve\nfor their new album, Amorica, but\nthankfully there's no sign of any\ndeterioration on the musical front.\nYes, the Crowes are still inhabiting\nsome drug-inhabited world circa\nlate '60s, early '70s but they've\nspread their creative wings to pull in\nthe Grateful Dead, War and the\nFlying Burrito Brothers alongside\nthe standard Stones and Faces\nsignposts.\nAnd what does that mean?\nWell, one word that sums the whole\naffair up is groove! Percussion is the\nname of the game from the ultra-rhythmic opener 'Gone' right\nthrough to the use of congas,\nHammond organ and a Spanish\ngui ro on 'High head blues'.\nElsewhere, there's the wonderfully\nfunky 'P.25 London' and moody,\ncountry-flavoured, deceptively\naddictive melodies like 'Wiser time'.\nOkay, so you don't get any\njump-out hit singles like 'Remedy'\nbut if you take the time to listen to it\nas a whole you get a flowing album\nfull of great songs. Sounds like a fair deal to me. Maybe Amorica\nisn't such a bad place to live after\nall (8).\nBeing a dedicated hack, the\nnew Ned's Atomic Dustbin album,\n522, was blasting out of my stereo\nwhen a friend walked in. \"Why are\nyou playing student music?\" he\ninquired. Ned's Atomic Dustbin fit\nright into this stereotype, despite\nthe originality of their rhythm\nsection. This album is however\npretty varied with the majority of\nthe 22 tracks being old school indie\nas favoured by the Wonder Stuff\nand Mega City Four. Five are more\nexperimental, like 'NAD v. NDX =\nIntact', and more in the lines of\nearly Jesus Jones or even industrial.\nBut then you'd expect a bit of\nvariation from an album released\nas a'b sides,odds and sods\ncompilation' and called 522 because\nthe tour dates are from 5th to 22nd November! It is only available on\ncd, but retails at a low price, you've\nguessed it, \u00a35.22. Would I recommend you to buy it? Can you be a student without it? (8)\nAny album with \"The best of...\"\nin the title normally worries me, but\nFields of gold: the best of Sting is an\nexception to the rule. 'It's probably\nme', with Eric Clapton, is far better\nthan the version on \"Ten\nsummoner's tales\" and it's apparently from Lethal Weapon 3,\nalthough I failed to spot it when I saw the film. Another film song,\n'Demolition man - soul power edit',\nis irritating at first, but after hearing\nit a few times you grow to like it.\nFor me the combination of the\nclassic songs, film songs, new songs\nand alternate versions of 'Nothing\nbout me' and 'We'll be together'\nmake this album very different from\nthe usual best of efforts. It's also\nvery long, at 1 7 tracks and 76\nminutes, so if you like Sting in\nsmaller doses, it'll take you a while\nto get through it all. However, this\ndoes mean it's good value for\nmoney, so for this and the yellow\ncd, it gets a(9). \u00a9\nFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Incoming\nThe facts are laid bare... Edited this week by Marcus Alexander C JB Under\nPressure\nDear Felix,\nI thought what an excellent\neditorial you wrote on police\nbashing two weeks ago. It\naddressed the demonstration from\nthe viewpoint of the ordinary citizen\nrather than from the usual trendy\nstudent direction. However I noted\nwith disappointment that you\nlapsed back into the usual pattern\nafter pressure from the 'right on\ngang'. I also fail to see the\nconnection between the Criminal\nJustice Bill & Special branch. In\nfact you say \"Although not directly\nrelated\" so why bother to mention\nit? Perhaps it was merely a vehicle\nto slip in a joke about the\n'criminally unjustifiable bill'. Boom!\nBoom!\nYou fail to realise the purpose of\nSpecial Branch's surveillance\nactivities - they are not there to\ninfringe civil rights as you imply,\nbut to uphold and protect our\ndemocratic system. Some, but by\nno means all of these activists seek\nto overthrow or undermine our\nparliamentary democracy by many\nmethods. No-one can deny that.\nTo seek to stop these surveillance\nactivities would be madness and in\na roundabout fashion would cause\nthe whole nations civil rights to be\ninfringed.\nYour comments about a police\nstate are absolute stuff and\nnonsense. I feel that if you lived in\na police state you would certainly\nknow about it and probably have\nhad your editorial blacked out by\nnow. If we were living in the Soviet\nUnion under the KGB and GRU\nyour comments might have been\nacceptable and I am sorry but\nfrankly the suggestion that the\nUnited Kingdom in a police state\noffends me. Perhaps you should\nmove to certain countries in South\nAmerica or South East Asia and you\ncould find out what a police state is\nactually like.\nYours sincerely\nRichard M. Phillips\nGeology III\nToo darn right. It's about time\npeople stopped jumping onto these\nbandwagons and started to question\nthings for themselves. The CJB may\nnot be so bad. Does it really matter\nif demonstrations are criminal is ed? When was the last time a demonstration had any effect on\npolitics? After all, politicians have\nnot got where they are today by\ngoing against the system - they are\nin it, they love it. Do you honestly\nthink they have any respect for a mob of scruffy, long haired youths\nwho are just looking for the first\nexcuse to smash a brick over a policeman's head? Get real. If you\nwant to change the system then\nwork with it. Buy a suit.\nAs for the Special Branch, of\ncourse they are needed. A system\ncannot work without somebody to\ngovern it, especially if a proportion\nof the population is out to destroy\nthe system wherever they can. So\ngive the Special Branch a round of\napplause!\nButt Out!!\nDear All,\nAs you are no doubt well aware, it\nis near the end of Rag Week with\nonly a few events left, a few events\nthat are often under-subscribed to.\nAlso, this lunchtime there is a UGM\nin the Ents Lounge of the Union\nBuilding. In order that these last\nfew events are better attended, and\nto liven up the proceedings, a motion has been proposed to this\nmeeting encouraging the\nparticipation of the Sabbaticals in\nthe Sponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump. However if this\nmeeting is also poorly attended, it\nis possible that their own\nreluctance to get involved in Rag\nwill prevent the motion from being\npassed.\nTherefore we call for all those of\na mind to encourage the Sabbs to\n'get their kit off for charity' should\nturn up with their Union cards on\nFriday lunchtime at 1:00 pm and\nvote en masse for this motion. It\nshould be noted that at least 100\nstudents are needed to make this\nmeeting quo rate, so bring your\nfriends, family and pets along too.\nFor those of you worried for the\nsafety of the Sabbs, you need n't be, the most damage they will\nreceive is sunburn from each\nothers' embarrassment, I know\nbecause I have done 'the jump'\nmyself.\nIf you cannot make it on Friday,\nsponsor somebody or come along\non Saturday to cheer at this\nlighthearted piece of fun. If the\nmotion mysteriously does not make\nit to the UGM, it was last seen on\nIan Parish's desk on Monday, and\nthat will have a lot to say about the\nbureaucracy in the Union.\nAlex Feakes\nSimon Cooper\nPhysics II\nWell, if there are still a few people\nwho find sponsored indecency\namusing, then they are quite\nwelcome to it. However, the fact\nthat this 'hilarious' event is so poorly\nattended speaks for itself. Is this act\nof gross illegality so funny? I think\nnot. Attempting to make the Sabbs\ndo the same is rather pathetic. As\nfor the idea that you may actually\nbe able to make Quorum, that\nseems about as probable as myself\nwinning the National Lottery,\nwithout a ticket. But if you do\nmanage to get people to go to a UGM, then I shall eat my words, as I too know how popular they are.\nLight of Truth.\nDear Felix,\nI am one of the rare breed of\nintrospective individuals of whom\ndear Frater would so passionately\napprove. In responding to some\npoints raised by him last week my\nintention is not to flout my own\nopinions but hopefully to simply\nfoment a more vibrant debate.\nPerhaps we must start by asking\nthe most fundamental question,\nWhat is truth (enlightenment)?\nIs it an achievement or a goal or an\nabstract concept to be eu logi sed and coveted? Can truth be\ndefined within the parameters of\nhuman value? In asking these\nquestions I am not seeking to form\na conclusion, for a conclusive mind\nis surely a closed mind. Can a mind shackled and restricted by the\never pervading myriad conditioning\ninfluences ever act but within a 'narrow diffused sphere'? Can\nsuch a mind so conditioned by\nambition, fear and greed ever\nknow that which is limitless,\nun quantifiable, absolute? Note, I am making no claims, I am\ndrawing no conclusions, but merely\nasking, exploring this question of\ntruth.\nIf truth is an absolute entity can\nthere by paths leading to it? Is not\ntruth its own reference? Think\nabout it, don't jump to instant and\nunconsidered reactions. Consider\nthe sages, seers and mystics\nwalking this path - is not walking a path with hope of reward in itself\ninherently ambitious? Is what they\nachieve truth or is it merely a mental projection of their own\ncreated virtue? Is not forsaking all\nworldly possessions and embarking\non a life of penance and sanctity\nworthless if the initiator and\ncatalyst is ambition? The\ndifference between worldly and\nspiritual ambition is only in degree\nnot in kind. If you search with\nexpectation then how can you find\nanything but that which satiates\nyour own desires? Must not all\nexplorations therefore be totally,\nunequivocally and unconditionally\nfree from from all conditioning\ninfluences? Truth is surely of the\npresent, it is with us every moment\nof our lives. In the words of\nEmerson, \"Each moment has its\nown beauty. One never seen\nbefore and never to be seen\nagain\". So it is with truth.\nYours sincerely\nKedar Pandya\nMech. Eng. 3\nHmmm. Such an interesting letter\ndeserves a considered response. I think that one must first ask ,\"ls\ntruth enlightenment?\". I feel they\ndiffer. Enlightenment can most\nusefully be classed as a path\ntowards losing one's shackles and\nconditioning influences and gaining\na clear understanding. Note that it\nis a path, and not a goal; as Kedar\nstates, aiming for a goal implies\nambition, and ambition is contrary\nto enlightenment.\nTruth, however, differs. It is 'of\nthe moment' and has no clear\nunderlying meaning. If any truth is\nreached through the path of light, it\nis the Meta Truth behind that of\nnormal existence. One must\nremember that with each skin shed,\nanother lies beneath. Upon\nconsulting my acquaintance, your\ngood Frater, he simply replied by\nquoting, \"Aha!\".\nI JT FELIX I8I10 U91 "

Reported thefts in the past week have included two\nc asset e radios from cars in the Royal School of Mines car park and four\nwallets. Linstead and Weeks halls of residence have had games machines and\na pool table broken into, and damage was done to the chocolate machine in the\nUnion building, pictured above.\nQ news one&two&three \u2022 editorial& credits three \u2022 incoming four&five \u2022 the s files seven\n\u2022 American Culture eight \u2022 CluedUp nine \u2022\nfeature: The Phoenix Arises eleven \u2022 feature:\nPink Floyd twelve \u2022 feature: Pierced and Painted thirteen \u2022 Twilight Tales fifteen \u2022 xtra\ncurricular sixteen&seventeen \u2022 standby eighteen&nineteen&twenty \u2022 seven day guide twenty two& twenty three \u2022 sport twenty four H Rag Mag Slagged\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nA frenzy has broken out after the\npublication of this year's Rag\nMag. The magazine, whose\nproceeds will be donated to Rag's charities, features pictures of\nmutilated and pierced male\ngenitals. Titled 'Doing it for the\nkids', the front cover shows a picture of the Moor's Murderers\ncollecting for the Royal Society\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to\nChildren. Commenting on the\nmagazine, Ian Robertson, Rag\nChair, said: \"Personally, I feel\nvery offended by it.\"\nIt is rumoured that a motion\nto ban the magazine will be\nraised at today's Union General\nMeeting (UGM). However, as\nFELIX went to press, no motion\nhad been presented to the UGM\nChair. If presented, the motion\nwould be too late to be added\nautomatically to the agenda. But\nLucy Chothia, acting U GM Chair in the absence of Karl\nDrage, said it would be up to the\nU GM to decide if it could be\npresented. Ms Chothia said that\nshe would not let a technicality\nbar any motion.\nFriday night entrance fees\nwill also be reviewed at the\nUGM. Currently, access to the\nUnion building on Friday nights\ncosts \u00a31, even if only for the use\nof the bar. Whilst acknowledging\nthat students should pay\nentrance fees to attend specially\norganised events, the motion\ndemands that access to the\nquadrangle and bars be free.\nDan Look, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services),\nsaid that he could understand\nstudents' misgivings about the\ncurrent policy, but felt that the\nalternatives were largely\nimpractical. He suggested that\nstudents could avoid the\nentrance charge by arriving\nbefore 9pm, when admission to\nthe Union is free.\nIn previous years, there has\nbeen no charge for access to the\nsmaller Union bar, but stewards\nhave said that keeping the two\nareas separate has caused great\ndifficulties. In addition, if the\ncharge was simply for access to\nthe Ents Lounge, then the Bar\nwould have to close at 11pm. It\ncould not support a bar\nextension.\nResponding to the motion,\nSam Michel, Imperial College\nUnion Events manager,\nconsidered the practical\ndifficulties of trying to charge\nstudents at the entrance to the\nevents lounge: \"This would\ndefinitely create a substantial\nbottleneck.\" He added that it\nwould, \"pose security problems\nboth in terms of money being\ncollected and for the stewarding\nof doors.\" Mr Michel felt that the\nresulting financial losses would\nhave to be paid for indirectly by\nstudents. He also noted that the\ncapacity of the Union building\non a typical Friday night is 550\npeople, including those in the\nwhole quad. A paying event\nwould provide a far easier means\nof restricting access.\nIn a separate UGM motion,\nICU sabbaticals may be\nmandated to participate in Rag's Sponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump. The event\ninvolves jumping from a minibus\noutside Harrods wearing only a bow tie and then getting back to\nCollege. The response has been\nhostile. If the motion is passed,\nLucy Chothia, ICU President,\nhas already stated that she will\nignore the decision. She stressed\nthat being naked in public was\nillegal and that a UGM's decision does not take\nprecedence over civil law. When\nasked why she had done nothing\nto stop the 'illegal' event, Ms\nChothia refused to comment.\n\n"

Unless, of course, you are Andy in\nwhich case picking other people's noses is a regular part of the working day. And judging\nby the queues outside his door it's a pretty\nlucrative business.\nDown in the basement of Kensington\nMarket, a whine reminiscent of a dentist's drill greets the innocent punter. But here\nthe group of anxiety ridden clients seem\nto be restricted to the young and\nbeautiful... the day may be long but it\nis certainly never dull.\nApparently imagination is\nalways worse than reality (going by\nthat eerie whine it would have to\nbe) and the first five minutes are\nthe worst. The pain and the ritual\nare part of the culture of the\nthing. \"Anyone can buy aT shirt,\nyou've got to be brave to have a tattoo\". As the vibrant image of a cobra wound itself around a client's left breast she could only\nagree.\nFrom 10am until 6pm Andy and John realise the\ndesigns dreamed up by endless\ncustomers. As they say, the only\nlimits are the size of your wallet\nand the depth of your\nimagination. This is for life, and\nit's definitely a cult thing. Like\ndoctors, they see parts of bodies\nevery day, and work is work. On\nthe other hand, women are urged\nto ask for Andy Dicksonsomething to do with size and age\n(his, as compared with John's). Our Andy supplies tattoos,\nstuds, rings and barbs. And some\ngreat statistics. At a going rate of \u00a360 a time, the pair pierce two or three\npenises each week, and (at just \u00a330) ten\nclitorises. Price differences are, of course,\naffected only by level of difficulty and have\nnothing whatsoever to do with personal\npreferences. Navels and noses (for a quality\nbody piercing ring) set you back only \u00a325. A simple stud in the nose costs a fiver. Ex-client\n(regular) now girlfriend, Jeannette, wears a ring through her nipple during the day and a barb for evenings of fun. She assures us it\ndoesn't hurt.\nTattoo prices range (rapidly) upwards\nfrom \u00a320. Arm bands for example are a minimum \u00a3100, and take anything from two\nto five hours. My temptation, a flores cent tattoo, will remain in my imagination as only\none out of the 2000 tattooists in Great Britain\nis prepared to do one. Florescents have a nasty carcinogenic habit.\nWhiter based skin results in brighter\ncolours, black is more effective on black\nskin. Bottoms are tougher (because the skin\nhas to bend here) whereas arm skin is\nsuppler and thus less costly to adorn.\nAnything under the trouser line is \u00a35\nmore. Whether this too is gender\nspecific is yours to discover. The best\njobs are done in one sitting, so deep\nimaginations and wallets may also\nrequire far reaching depths of\npatience.\nOn the other hand, many a daring client may find there is\nrather more pleasure in this thing\nthan may have been expected...\nFrom the client who\nhandcuffed herself to the chair and\nrefused to leave 'unsatisfied' to the\nwoman who howled with pleasure\nlike a dog, these men are not short\nof offers. Andy tells, smiling, the\nstory of a client with a bird\ntattooed Tow on her groin', who\nreturned an hour later to declare\n\"that was the most wonderful\nsexual experience 1 have ever had in\nmy life, I had to go home and\nchange my knickers.\" Similarly\nthere are those that simply jump up\nand strip off all remaining apparel.\nAmong the most memorable is\nthe 50 year old banker from a highly\ninfluential bank, whose name I cannot\nreveal, who now bears a grotesque\nwomen in bondage gear emblazoned on\nhis stomach.\nBoth guys are adamant, \"Nothing\nphases us anymore, we've seen it all\".\nPerhaps this will serve as some defence\nagainst the tattoo groupies that travel the\nworld to visit and bed famous tattooists, or\nthe rather unusual parties they get invited to\nas a result of certain piercings.\n1 feel it is time to disconnect the images\nof fat and bearded bikers from that of the\nlocal tattooist.\nIC men - this is your summer job.\n\n"

The weather forecast for\nthose days was wet but windy, so we managed\nto persuade 15 people to come along.\nOn Friday afternoon we packed the van\nwith boards, sails, masts, other equipment\nand of course our own belongings (beer). We\nthen left for Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, with high\nhopes, especially regarding the Essex\nUniversity boat house where we were going\nto sleep (or rather - spend the night) during\nthe weekend, thanks to their hospitality.\nDinner consisted mainly of beer, fish and\nSurfing: IC Surfers go to Essex to explore their talents with Boardsailing and women\nchips, and at this point we were prepared for\nwhat would be a major event in the weekend.\nAs we expected, there were quite a lot more\ngirls at Essex Union than at IC, although\nsome people were disappointed by their\nlooks. We all danced until the disco was over\nand some like Jim, Will or Alaric gained what\nI should call 'close friends'.\nSaturday was entirely dedicated to sail-ing. The temperature was low, but around\nmid-day we had some decent wind. It was a good chance to try our new boards and sails.\nThat night we had chilli for dinner, after\nwhich some left for the pub, some for a nightclub and some simply stayed in.\nWe all woke up late and tired on Sunday\nmorning, but didn't prevent us from sailing.\nWe had the strongest wind of the whole\nweekend, and it even felt a little warmer! The\nbeginners had a good opportunity to improve\ntheir skills, whereas the more experienced\nones were just speeding along. When it got\ndark, we packed the van and returned home\nwith a big smile in our faces. It had been a great sailing weekend.\nIf you feel interested and want to try\nwindsurfing, just come to our weekly meeting\nat Southside upper lounge, on Tuesday's at\n1.00pm. who: Overseas\nWhat: 6-a Side Football\nKeys: Hyde, Islamic, French\nRecently, the Pakistani Society furthered its\nreputation as a cosmopolitan society by\norganising a football tournament between\nother social groups. In particular, Faraz\nKhan, our sports representative coordinated\nwith other sports officers to such an extent\nthat a total of 6 teams took part, and that\nincluded two from the Pakistan Society itself.\nThe other four were the French, Sri Lankan,\nIndian and Islamic societies.\nThe first round occurred on Wednesday\n26th October. The six teams were split into\ntwo pools with each society playing the other\ntwo societies in their respective pools once.\nThe top two teams from each pool qualified\nfor the semi-finals. From pool A the Islamic\nand French societies qualified. The French\nsociety more than proved their worth by\nthrashing the Pakistan B team 8-0! From\npool B the Indian and Pakistan A team were\nsuccessful. These four contenders were given\na week's respite after which they reconvened\nin Hyde Park for a final showdown.\nA tough battle ensued between the\nFrench and Pakistan teams. At the end of full\ntime the score was two all with a late equal is er coming from the French. This forced the\ngames into extra-time in which the French\nblasted through our defence to end the game\n5-3.\nIn the other semi-final, the Indian team\nwas caught napping in the first half and paid\ndearly for it with the Islamic Society team\nhammering in three goals. A controversial\nsecond half followed in which the Indian\nteam failed to match the might of the Islamic\nteam but nevertheless scored two exciting\ngoals. This left the finalists to be the powerful\nIslamic Society team and the determined\nFrench players.\nThe final was fast-paced with much\ninnovative play and action. The defence of\nboth teams in the first half was impenetrable\nbut early in the second half the Islamic boys\nbroke the dead-lock. This must have disheartened the French greatly as they came\nback like a team on fire. Their war-like cries\nMM FELIX mum\n\n"

    "content": "News and Editorial\nThai Tech Transfer\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nImperial College is to receive a new electronics lab with the help\nof a Thai institution.\nMahanakorn University, based\nin suburban Bangkok and described as 'the biggest and fastest\ngrowing technology institution\nin Thailand', is to fund a new\nintegrated circuit design lab-oratory.\nThe laboratory, to be located\non the 9th floor of the Electrical\nand Electronic Engineering\nbuilding, will provide Mahanakorn University with Imperial\nCollege technology and allow\n'the highest quality' Thai\nstudents to train at Imperial.\nA similar laboratory will be\nset up in Thailand. Its aim will\nbe to duplicate work done at\nImperial with research feedback\npassing in both directions. The\nThai laboratory may enable IC\nstaff to run courses and provide\nconsultancy services. It will also\nallow British educated students\nto continue their work in\nThailand.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Dr\nChris Toumazou of the\nDepartment of Electrical and\nElectronic Engineering, said:\n\"It's a shame, these guys are so\nbright, but they don't have the\nfacilities [in Thailand].\" The\nnew scheme will attempt to\nresolve the situation, the Thai\nstudents being what he describes\nas, \"vehicles for technology\ntransfer to the Far East\".\nThe agreement should allow\nThailand the opportunity to\ncollaborate internationally in the\nfield of electronics which has\napplications in areas such as\nmedicine and mobile communications. Work in these fields\nis also to be conducted in the\nnew lab at Imperial which will be\navailable to postgraduates and\nundergraduates of the\ndepartment.\nThe new laboratory will\nmark a new phase of cooperation\nbetween Imperial and Mahanakorn, which has funded a readership and has been sending\nPhD students to IC for the last\ncouple of years. In all, the\ndepartment has been endowed\nwith over \u00a3600k from Mahanakorn. The Rector, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, said, \"Imperial is\npleased to share its expertise\nwith Mahanakorn both by\nper suing joint research projects\nand training its academic staff.\"\nThough the scheme is\nseparate from the one under\nconsultation in College (FELIX\n1010) Dr Toumazou said that the\nnew project would complement\nthe previous one 'as part of IC's continuing programme of links\nwith the Far East'.\nForgery\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nImperial has been bombarded\nwith a spate of forged bank notes\nin the past week.\nSeveral false \u00a320 notes have\nbeen cashed at Southside and in\nthe Union bar. Hari Nair,\nmanager of the Imperial Branch\nof the National Westminster\nBank, said that a number of the\nforgeries had also been found at\nthe bank.\nHowever, Terry Briley,\nDeputy Head of Security, said\nthat the problem was essential ya matter for the police to deal with.\n\"It's very difficult to trace the\nculprits of this kind of crime,\"\nhe said. Bar staff have been\nissued with guidelines to help\nthem identify the notes, and\nhave been asked to try and\nidentify those who are passing\nthem.\n(ii for i aL It is 4:30am; the second time this\nweek I 've noted the existence of\nthis hour. The first was in worse\nsurroundings than chilly FELIX\nTOWERS it was the casualty\ndepartment of the Chelsea and\nWestminster Hospital.\nHow can I write? Do I drip\nwith blood or sway woozy with\nanother swig of gas? Luckily my\ncasualty trip proved a false alarm.\nThe journey began on Sunday\nwhen I hit my head on a wooden\nchair. Jerking upwards I found\nthe walls, table and piles of\nclothes shiny and indistinct. I found it unlikely that my two-week old laundry pile had been\nimbued with any mystical aura\nand besides, the brightness was\ngiving way to misty ness. \"My left\neye is going blind\", I said to a friend who peered in. \"Lie\ndown,\" she said, and I did. If I closed the (good) right eye my\nvision was reduced to a receding\npool of clarity within a expanding circle of frosted glass.\nWithin a minute it glazed over.\nI would like to say at this\npoint I became hysterical but I'm too staid for that. Instead I remembered a similar incident\nten years ago, when my vision\nwent red in a school assembly\nand I thought I was being dealt\nwith harshly by an unknown\nforce (for only mouthing the\nwords to an uninspiring hymn).\nIsabel turned off the lights,\npresumably so there was nothing\nto see and thus my blindness\nwould be cured. But I could see\nblurry fish like lights. It was\nalmost like an optical 'stitch',\nwhere you kneel down and hope\nthat when you stand the pain will\nbe gone but you never know...\nThe stupid thing was that\nwhen my vision did return I forgot to be scared and carried on\nwith the day. On Monday I asked\neveryone I saw about it, even the\npsycho martial artists and the\nMary's medics. It was, of course,\nWaterstones who clinched it. I simply should buy my own\nFamily Health Diagnostic Guide. It\nwould have worked out great\nvalue by now considering the\nnumber of diseases it has\ndiagnosed for me (okay, so not all\nof those have fully bloomed yet\nbut a problem forewarned is a disaster halved...) Anyway:\nVision>Temporary Blindness\n> Emergency> Doctor.\nNow I panic. Having delayed\nmy emergency session by 30\nhours I delay a little longer to\nread that I may have a blood clot,\na brain tumour or worse.\nPanicking, I run around the\noffice for an hour telling\neveryone how bad it is. 'Go to\nCasualty!' they chorus. 'After\ncollating Guildsheet!' I reply and\nmake Guildsheet assistant editor\nAndy Sinharay's night awful by\ninsisting graphically how bad my\ndelayed medical attention is.\nAt 9:30pm I leave FELIX and walk to the Hospital. It\nseems ridiculous to stroll down to\nthe Accident and Emergency\ndepartment. Where is the\n'Paranoid and Unorganised'\nWing? I look through the\ngoldfish glass at scores of waiting\npeople. \"Hmmmm...\" mutters\nTim, who had wandered out from\nHarts. \"You'll need a good\nshotgun wound to jump that\nqueue...\" Foolishly I ignore him\nand wait five hours for the\nDoctor to tell me I was probably\nokay. In the meantime I had\nspent yet another chunk of my\nlife in a medical institution\ngrowing humble at scenes of\nmadness, patience, a naked old\nwomen clutching her purse as\nshe's wheeled by, a RCM student\nscared she'd lost a finger, a blok e in a tux ring 'Vinnie' to say the\n\"money is okay\", a conversation\nbetween a male doctor and a stout patient who said to his\nfriend \"You could have stuck\nyour finger up there at home\"\nand an argument over whether a seventeen year old girl should be\nforced to take a taxi home.\nCasualty, better than Casualty \\\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Helen Randall\nEditorial Team\nArt & Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kate Cox\nLayout and Design Dias & McFadden\nMusic Vik Bansal\nNews Andrew Tseng & Rachel Walters\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nRag Week Special Piers Daniell\nS Flles Tim Parsons\nSeven Day Guide Liz Caddy\nSport Juliette Decock and Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nTheatre Joseph Mohomed\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week Tim St. Clare,\nPaul Dias, Jon Jordan\nTyping Steven Se\nHelpfulness Rahul Joshi\n!\n8\nnOU94 FELIX MM\n\n"

Culture guides the\nbeliefs and free-time activities of people.\nIf you were watching the excellent film\nSilence of the Lambs on television a while\nback, one aspect of their culture was evident.\nCompare if you will Hannibal Lecter with\nITV's favourite hero, James Bond. We all\nknow James: he is intelligent, strong and\nresourceful, with a quick mind, an ability to\nadapt to new situations and fluency with\nthe Lambs Lectcr sits in the villain's chair.\nThe thinking man is cruel, vicious,\n' a devil and a This suggests that in America,\nintelligence is associated with evil. It's a me in films over the past 20\nyears. Another example is in the lil in I);,I' m stupid?\", \"If you think about it...\" and\n\"Imagine if...\". Apparently inconsequential,\nthe difference is a psychological permission\nto think or not to think.\nWhen the differences between people's ability to think become small, there's little\nway to differentiate between them except by\nappearance. Looks are the only part of a person's character not needing verbal\nsubstantiation. The image is very important\nto American youth. In this country we wear a school uniform.

In an instant he is a snivelling office clerk. The villain is thus\nagain shown to be quick-thinking.\nThe theme of evil associated with\nintelligence is seen as a justification for not\nbeing intelligent. If you were a kid looking\nfor a role model, would you choose someone\nevil? I don't think so. American films use\nphrases like \"No-one likes a smart arse\" and\n\"I don't pay you to think!\". English films\nhave included phrases such as \"Do you think\nemphasis in\nli ffe rent i a ting between\npeople at school has to be\nthe way they act; maybe even the way they\nthink.

When thinking is (sub)consciously\nseen to be bad, does it not make for an\nignorant and unquestioning race of people?\nThe British have cultural permission to\nthink, Americans do not.

We focus on one scientist [Robert d lay] who has successfully broken the mould and helped\nfound a new science.\nIn the past, science has been deterministic. It was thought that a set of linear rules would eventually lead us to understand the world [a \u00b0b \u00bbeure ha]. Science was\nstraightforward, rigidly divided into disparate disciplines. Now, science trail blazers\ncross interdisciplinary boundaries and investigate non-linearity in subjects from\neconomics to epidemiology. New disciplines in science are erupting [chaos, complexity\nand artificial life] on the strength of these changes, and their practitioners have a diverse\nset of backgrounds. Chaos is one such discipline.\nRobert (\nT lay FRS, Trustee of\nNatural History\nMuseum & Kew\nGardens, Editor\nof the journal\n'Nature'.\nCrossing one r?\"I started as a Chemical Engineer at Sydney University and\nbecame a professor in the Physics depart-ment. I gave a seminar at Imperial College\n[Silujood Park], and met lots of biologists\nthere. They had formulated lots of interesting ecological questions...what's the relation\nbetween diversity and stability, what's the\nlimits to niche-overlap and competitive simi-lari ty? Many of these questions were formulated in analytical hard\u00b0SCience terms but\nthey lacked people with the background to\nsolve them. So by accident I blundered into\nEcology. Pure accident, no design, at a time\nwhen it was ripe for someone like myself.\"\nHard us soft science?\nI'm in an unusually good position to talk\nabout hard\u00b0soft science, having\nhad a complete career in\nboth.\nI think these dichotomies are\nby and large nonsense. They are artifacts in\nthe minds of people who usually don't know\nwhat they're talking about. Training in\nPhysics teaches you to see the world as a complicated place but with underlying sim-pli cities. You try and identify the complicated situation and ask \"What are the things I think are really important?\". You express\nthat with precision, which usually means a mathematical model, then you test it against\nthe world to see if your original assumptions\nwere right. There's a great deal of soft science\nin Physics, a great deal of hard science in\nBiology. What I 've done in Ecology is no different from what I did in Physics: making\nmathematical metaphors to see where they\nlead me\"\nhype ref03 James Gleick: science writer &\neditor, wrote Pulitzer Prize nominee\n'Chaos: Making a New Science'.\n\\>) S Files Winners (-:/\nCongratulations Paul de Cort. your plug and play potato wins this week's competition.

Small perturbations in a non-linear system such as the\natmosphere can multiply to have a huge overall\neffect; so a butterfly flying in Asia could cause a storm over\nChicago. The implications of this effect weren't realised until a crucial paper was discovered by James Vorke, who coined the\nterm ChaOS.\nMeanwhile, Robert ITIay was working on simple population models. An infamous story (recounted in Gleich S book\n\u00a30) is that, intrigued by the effects of a growth parameter\n(lambda) on his model, he wrote the problem on a corridor\nblackboard for graduate students. \"What the Christ happens ui hen lambda gets bigger than the point of accumulation?\", when the nonlinear parameter (lambda) was low, his model settled to e qui lib rium, while increasing lambda made the model oscillate\nbetween two values. These 'bifurcation sequences' continued to\ndouble as lambda increased, until a critical point - the point of\naccumulation - when the final system was maddeningly unpredictable. May was stumped. He offered $10 to anyone who\ncould figure it out.\n\"Nobody ever got the ten dollars. In 1973 I went to Maryland\nto give a seminar about population dynamics. I said 'I understand this (the bifurcations) but I don't understand what happens\nafter the point of accumulation...'. James Vorke was in the audience\nand he had not understood the bifurcation sequences but he said \"I know what happens next\". Between us, we had the complete picture\nand we began to realise how extraordinarily important its implications\nwere. Gradually we became aware of S or 6 other people who had\nknown of the mathematical phenomenon, none of them with the\nslightest sense of what it all meant. As Jim Yorke was fond of saying, 'we weren't the first to discover chaos, we were the last\" May's most important contribution was his 'messi an ic' Nature paper, in which he urged that chaos should be\ntaught as part of standard scientific education. Try as we might,\nwe can't boil the world down to a set of linear equations.\n\"The world mould be a better place if all\nstudents mere given a pocket calculator and\nencouraged to play with nonlinear equations\"\n1\n8\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n9\n1 FELIX HI\n\n"
