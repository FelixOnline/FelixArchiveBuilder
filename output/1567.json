The first being that Behemoth are\na huge metal band. Behemoth are a household\nname in their native Poland (Behemoths lead\nguitarist, vocalist and lyricist, Nergal was a\njudge on the Polish version of The Voice) and\nhave earned a large international following due to their fierce metal sound. The\nsecond reason being that in 2010 Nergal was diagnosed with Leukaemia.\nOriginally told that his Leukaemia could not be treated due to its advanced\nstate, a diagnosis that subsequently was proved false as Nergal subsequently\nrecoveredafterabonemarrowtransplant,thebrushwithmortalityhasresulted\nin the band writing their most focused, daring and atmospheric album to date.\nMoving away from the heathen lyrical content, The Satanist shows Behemoth\nembracing (unsurprisingly) more satanic imagery. The Recruitment of occultist\npainter Denis Forkas Kostromitin to paint the artwork for the album (artwork\nwhichusedNergalsbloodmixedinthepaintnoless)istestamenttothischange\nin thematic direction.\nThe album begins with the surprisingly tense and atmospheric \u201cBlow Your\nTrumpets Gabriel\u201d\n. Combining Nergal\u2019s harsh, dangerous, vocals with doomy\nguitarriffsandhauntingtrumpetstheopenerebbsandflowsfromdoomyguitar\nand trumpet to brutal blast beat sections. Where \u201c\u2026Gabriel\u201d is atmospheric the\nnext six songs show that Behemoth have no fears about playing fast. Songs such\nas \u201cFuror Divinus\u201d with its melodic guitar lines and furious drumming, to the\nwonderful \u201cOra Pro Nobis Lucifer\u201d with it\u2019s catchy (for Death Metal) hooks to\nthe black metal themed Amen all showcase Behemoths intricate understanding\nof the sound they wish to achieve.\nThe album then returns to more atmospheric pastures with \u201cIn Absence\nOf Light\u201d featuring spoken word sections over acoustic guitars. The closer is\npossibly the best track on the album displaying Behemoth\u2019s ability to balance\nthe heavier and more sections of their sound with the anthemic choir and\norchestra sections, without sounding cheesy or losing their vicious edge.\nMusically \u201cThe Satanist\u201d is not the weirdest or heaviest of Behemoths releases\n(In my opinion Demigod deserves the title of heaviest) this album features a\nrevitalised Behemoth unleashing a focussed and united piece of work.\nBehemoth \u2013 The Satanist\nalbum, for the sake of comparison if\nnothing else.\nThe name Sunn O))), as well as\nbeing a reference to the Fender Amp\nmodel, was a reference to drone metal\npioneers Earth, with the idea of Sunn\nrevolving around Earth in mind.\nDylan Carlson, the founder of Earth,\nis also the subject of a track on The\nGrimmrobe Demos (1999).\nTheir most recent studio effort,\nMonoliths and Dimensions (which\ninterestingly features Carlson himself)\nsaw the band experimenting with\nmore orchestral textures.\nUlver, who have seemingly reached\na similar point of experimentation, are\na Norwegian band who started out\nas a Black Metal group, but before\nthe end of an early set of albums\ncalled Black Metal Trilogie they had,\nironically, moved away from anything\nthat would traiditionally called black\nmetal. They then released Themes from\nWilliam Blake\u2019s The Marriage of\nHeaven and Hell, an album considered\na masterpiece through its blending\nof black metal with a wider range of\ngenres including industrial, ambient\nand some electronic sounds.\nThe folklore inspired band has\nincorporated an impressive selection of\ngenresovertheircareerandinmanyways\nit seems like a confluence of directions,\nwith both bands working towards\nmore acoustic, or even symphonic,\ninstrumentation. It seems only apt that\nthe two bands should release together\nand the announcement of this album\ncertainly created a stir.\nThe result is expectedly unexpected,\nin other words, seems to follow both\nband\u2019s trajectory, but certainly is very\ndifferent from what each band\u2019s genre\nmay be on paper.\nTerrestrials was certainly a long\ntime in the making. It was originally\nmade in Ulver\u2019s Crystal Canyon\nstudio in Oslo in 2008, recorded \u2018live\nin improvisation\u2019 over the course of a\nsingle night. Since that fateful night,\nadditional violins, violas and trumpets\nwere added to the album, which\ncertainly give a much thicker timbre\nand perhaps add a little to the sense\nof epic grandeur in a surpremely great\nmusical journey, but admittedly this\nmay be largely due to the atmosphere\nof the recording;\n\u201cYou know that opening sequence\nof Koyaanisqatsi, where the desolate\ndesert landscapes, waves and cloud\nformations roll over the screen\naccompanied by deep male chanting\nand organ ostinatos. That\u2019s where we\nwere.\u201d \u2013 Daniel O\u2019Sullivan\nKoyaanisqatsi was an abstract film\nfeaturing pictures of beautiful scenery\nand marvels of nature juxtaposed with\nchaotic images of urban life. It also,\nrather endearingly, is backed up by an\namazing soundtrack, scored by Philip\nGlass. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s words underline an\nalmost cinematic or theatrical feel to\nthe album, as well as almost bypassing\ndrone and modernising the art of\nminimalist composition.\nSunn O)))\u2019s Stephen O\u2019Malley,\na noted purveyor of sonic doom,\nadditionally described the album\nas \u2018more raga than rock,\u2019 and this is\ncertainly an important aspect, but far\nfrom refuting my minimalism point,\nit merely reinforces it, as pretty much\nall of the early Minimalist composers,\nincluding Glass, Terry Riley, and La\nMonte Young, dabbled in non-western\nmusic, and particularly Indian music\nas a source of inspiration for their\nwork, and a great example of this can\nbe found in Young\u2019s releases with his\nproject Theatre of Eternal Music.\nThe opener \u2018Let there be light\u2019\nis certainly reminiscient to me of\nKoyaanisqatsi, especially in the use\nof some rather minimalist repetitive\npulsing, which is most noticably\naugmented by a very eastern sounding\ntrumpet, which gives it a very\ntheatrical, ethereal ambience.\n\u2018Western Horn,\u2019 the second track\nis perhaps closer to Sunn O)))\u2019s roots,\nif only by virtue of posessing some\nlow drones, and I guess if I were really\ntrying to push the minimalist thing\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s more Young than Glass.\nIt slowly develops, with variations\nin the background and in so doing\nmoves through a variety of moods,\nmost notably a style which, tonally at\nleast, almost recalls doom metal but\nadmittedly it lacks pounding drums,\nor any drums at all. Comforting\nambient sounds, feedback and piano\ntones occasionally protrude through\nthe harsh sonic surface and these\nmoments of contrast are highly\nsatisfying.\nThe album seemlessly meanders\nintothealbumcloser- \u2018EternalReturn.\u2019\nThis is possibly the most interesting\ntrack on the album, and listening\nto the opening couple of minutes,\nwhere we hear a sort of bassy drone\nmetal-ish sound with strings over it,\nI am very much reminded of Earth\u2019s\nrecent work, which I would describe\nas Drone-Country. The most notable\nchange to follow is the lyricism,\npreceeded by synth line over which I\ncan almost hear the persistent chant\nof \u2018Koyaanisqatsi.\u2019 I have to admit that\nvocals in experimental music rarely do\nit for me, and I\u2019ve often felt that overt\nhuman intervention in ethereal music\nshatters the ambience, but I must\nadmit that on repeated listens the\nvocals are rather evocative and seem\nto form the climax of the album.\nThis is followed by bleak droning\nand a return to the initial Earth-ish\nmotif, which is developed by the\ngradual addition of elements to create\na very emotional and cathartic end.\nI\u2019ve often wanted to see modern\nambient or experimental musicians\ndistilling, in a less subtle manner\nthan they already do, the ideas of\nminimalist composition into a modern\npiece, and aside from perhaps the\nwork of Svarte Greiner (the closest\nthing I\u2019ve found), it seems I\u2019ve finally\nmanaged to find something like that in\nTerrestrials.\nMy summation of the album is\nthat it\u2019s the result of two bands coming\ntogether at the perfect time, making\nsomething grandiose and powerful,\nwhich at times feels more like a\ncomposition than an improvised work\nfrom 2 (formally) metal bands.\nIt\u2019s truly a musical journey, as it\nmoves through a rich variety of genres\nand moods, and it\u2019s a journey in which\nI was thoroughly immersed. This is\ncertainly an early album of the year\ncontender, now someone just needs to\nproduce an appropriately ethereal film\nto accompany it....\nRiaz Agahi examines a collaboration that\u2019s more minimal than metal\nRob Garside\n\n"

However, the way\nRussia has been behaving domestically\nhas been questionable to say the least.\nHuman rights issues and a lack of\nfree speech allows Russia to be open\nto major scrutiny. If Russia wishes\nto make the unnecessarily expensive\nOlympic games successful, it has to\nchange the way it has been behaving\nboth domestically and internationally.\nKartikeya Rana looks at the Ukraine protests and its link with Russia\nRussia and the situation in Ukraine\nKartikeya Rana\nPolitics Editor\nU\nkraine has been\ncurrently going through\na very tumultuous\nperiod with protests\nand rioting in various\nparts of the country. The interest of\nthe Russian government in Ukraine\nmay have a grave impact on the Sochi\nWinter Olympics and lead to further\nscrutiny of the Putin government\nby western powers and the world\nmedia. Thus, Putin has to be very\ncareful about what steps he takes\ninternationally, more so now than\never before.\nUkraine has been going through\nintense ever since President\nYanukovich suspended trade talks\nwith the EU (Ed: sic). These trade\nagreements would have eased off some\ntravel restrictions that the country\nhad been facing in mainland Europe.\nThe free trade agreement would have\nallowed the movement of machinery\nand transport equipment as well as\nother goods to the country, which\nwould have boosted its manufacturing\nindustry tremendously. Furthermore,\nUkraine would have been able to\nfurther its export of iron, steel, mining\nas well as agricultural products to\nthe EU bringing in much needed\nforeign currency. The general public\nsupported the trade agreement and\nas a result, the suspension has led\nto bitter resentment amongst the\nUkrainian people. So why did Kiev\nsuspend this trade agreement even\nthough they knew stalling such a move\ncould have been a political disaster?\nVladmir Putin has been bitterly\nopposed to this trade agreement from\nthe outset. Thus, there was a threat\nof a loss of trade with Russia if the\nUkranian government becomes more\ninvolved with the EU. The official\nstatement from President Yanukovich,\naccording to the BBC, is that Ukraine\ncould not afford to sacrifice trade with\nRussia. This may have been true to an\nextent due to the links that Ukraine\nhas had with Russia in the past. The\nrelationships between Russia and\nUkraine have been well established\nfrom the time of the Soviet Union\nand although the Union has been\ndismantled, a large proportion of the\nlinks still remain. The statement by\nthe President may have played against\npeople\u2019s emotions due to the atrocities\nand prejudices faced by them under\nSoviet rule in the past. The idea of\nhaving their independent government\nbow down to Russian pressure may\nbring back some bitter resentment.\nHowever, there is evidence to\nbelieve there is more to this situation.\nUkraine is said to be \u201cthe most\ncorrupt nation in Europe\u201d according\nto Transparency International. People\nare seen to be dissatisfied with the\ncurrent establishment and would\nalso like systematic change. The\nidea that Ukraine is falling under\nRussian pressure may be blamed on\nthe fact that it currently has a weak\nand corrupt establishment. Since the\ngovernment has too strong a desire to\nremain in power, it would rather bow\ndown to Russian economic pressure\nand sanctions than follow what is good\nfor the nation as a whole. This has\nadded further fuel to the protests and\nthe opposition has been supporting\nthe protestors for trying to tackle\nthe current establishment. However,\nthe government has not been willing\nto listen and has been threatening\nstringent actions if the protestors do\nnot leave the government buildings.\nThe police has already been very\nbrutal in its way of tackling the\nprotestors and may not listen to the\npeople\u2019s demands anytime soon.\nThe Russian establishment has\nshown bitter resentment against the\nEU trade agreements for a number of\nreasons. The official statement claims\nthat the free trade agreement could\nbe a \u2018big threat\u2019 to Moscow. This is\nbecause; the goods from Europe could\nbe flooded into Moscow virtually\nwithout tariffs due to the free trade\nagreement between Moscow and Kiev.\nThis, according to Putin, would cause\nRussia\u2019s car, agriculture and aviation\nindustries to suffer. The damage\nto the Russian industry, however,\nwill not be as large as it would be\ntowards his ego. A lot of rules and\nregulations can be put in place to\nmaintain Russian industry, which the\nRussian authorities can be able to\nmaintain. There are also reasons to\nbelieve that Putin may be against the\ntrade agreements for personal gains.\nPutin has a desire for Ukraine to join\nthe customs union, which includes\nRussia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. By\nenhancing the union, Putin wishes\nto expand Russia\u2019s influence in the\nregion.\nThe politics of pressure and\nsanctions, however, is not one, which\na modern nation should follow to\nexpand its field of influence. The\nidea that Russia wishes to divide the\nnations in an archaic, post First World\nWar fashion\nseems to be\ndisconnected\nfrom the\nmodern form\nof diplomacy.\nFurthermore,\nVladmir Putin\nhas to be careful\nabout the steps\nhe takes due to\nthe upcoming\nSochi Winter\nOlympics.\nC l e a r l y ,\nRussia wishes\nto establish\nitself as a very\ni n f l u e n t i a l\npower and\nhas been\nm o d e r a t e l y\nsuccessful in\ndoing so. As\na supporter\nof the Assad\nregime and\nhaving signed\noil agreements\nwith Iran,\nRussia has\nbeen expanding\nits sphere of\ninfluence in the\nArab world.\nFurthermore,\nby signing\nfree trade\na g r e e m e n t s\nwith China,\nRussia has been\nable to make\nitself an active\nmember in\nworld affairs.\nTo further show\nits strength, Russia has decided to\nhold the Winter Olympics in Sochi, a\nfond holiday resort of Vladmir Putin.\nThese Olympics have already been\nmarked with serious controversy\nwith local wildlife and population\nbeing dispersed. People have been\nforcibly evicted from their homes for\ndevelopment purposes. Furthermore,\nthe whole project has been seen to\nbe rampant with corruption with a\nlarge proportion of spending being\ndiverted elsewhere. The games have\nbeen proclaimed to be even more\nexpensive than the Beijing Olympics\nbut how much of these expenses have\nbeen efficiently spent is questionable.\nLocals have not been satisfied with\nthe construction process and have\nblamed the authorities for disrupting\ntheir lifestyle and putting their futures\nin jeopardy for the sake of ensuring a\nsuccessful Olympic event.\nRussia has been trying to clean\nits image by allowing certain\npolitical prisoners, such as Mikhail\nKhodorkovsky, to be released and\nCNN NEWS\nLet\u2019s have more than\ntwo people sharing\ntheir views on\nPolitics.\nSend your articles\nto:\nKartikeya Rana\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nDr Silvia Bello\nPalaeoanthropologist\n\u2018They say everyone has\nskeletons in their closet,\nI actually do.\u2019\n\n"

You would\ngive someone due respect\nif they were reasonable\nand polite to you, as anyone should\nbe, or you would give them special\nconsideration, such as offering your\nseat on the bus, if they were physically\ninfirm, not just because they were\nold. It is not the case that I resent\nold people; I\u2019m just very suspicious\nof anyone who demands special\ntreatment for being in a position\nthat is passively attained, like being\nprivately educated, provided that it\nis not an affliction, though many may\nview old age as one.\nBack in the good old days, as many\na pensioner would wistfully sigh, once\nyou were claiming your free bus pass\nyou were a has-been. Still dignified,\nyet of reduced means compared to\nyour prime. Not quite a second class\ncitizen, but no chance of being as\ninfluential as you once were. This\nwould be a typical experience, though\nthings are changing.\nWhen I was in the local record shop\nlast week I noticed something very\nstrange in the new releases section.\nAbout half the LPs were in fact\nrepackaged and re-released Beatles\nalbums and compilations. Others in\nthe section included the new Mogwai\nalbum and a Herbie Hancock re-release. The aforementioned are all\ngreat artists, however, it had never\nstruck me so hard how difficult it must\nbe to break into the music business as\na youngster when you are contending\nwith people such as this. Baby boomer\nWill Self recently reflected on the\nsame issue of how, whilst minding his\nchildren at Reading Festival, all the\nteenagers were flocking to see bands\nin their forties and fifties, whereas\nhe thought Bob Dylan, then aged 38,\nwas a relic of a bygone era when he\nsaw him in his youth. Technology, be\nit in media or medicine, is helping to\npreserve the aged, and this is fuelling\nour era\u2019s lust for nostalgia. And yes, I\ndo realise the irony of a record shop\nbeing the setting of this.\nThe apparent cessation of the\nageing process is one of the biggest\nreasons that is making it increasingly\ndifficult for young people to \u2018make\nit\u2019 in Britain today. The increase of\ntuition fees would help subsidise\nold age pensions which is by far the\nbiggest expenditure in the benefits\nbudget. I wasn\u2019t completely opposed\nin principle to \u00a39000 fees when they\ncame in, however now that they are\nthe status quo it seems that they\nwere an effective way to engineer the\nsocial makeup of universities; many\npeople are tragically ignorant of how\nto finance their higher education and\nstruggle to view it as an investment.\nMeanwhile, amongst the most savage\nspending cuts, politicians debate\nwhether or not to stop giving free TV\nlicences to the richest pensioners.\nThe youth is also despised by our\nelders; statistics suggest the general\npublic believe 15% of girls under 16\nare pregnant every year (in truth only\n0.6% are) whereas the majority of news\nstories about young people in the\nhouse wife and suburban orientated\nmedia focus on stabbings or how\nsomeone on legal highs mutilated\nthemselves or their loved ones.\nSome councils even install mosquito\nemulating buzz tones in public spaces\nto prevent yoofs from congregating, a\npolicy that is unlikely to improve the\nself-esteem of those that it targets.\nThe days of 16-24 being the best years\nof your life have sadly long gone.\nThe government consistently\nfavouring old over young people\nis understandable; old people\nvote whereas young people don\u2019t.\nWhenever I hear Russell Brand telling\nus not to vote, I cry deep down inside\nbecause the people to whom this\nadvice will be of most detriment to are\nthe ones most likely to take it. Inaction\nis not going to solve any issues; a\ngovernment under the current system\nwill still form if some people abstain\nfrom voting. If you want to improve\nthe prospects of your generation as\nwell as for yourself, then vote for\nthose who you believe will stand for\nthat. Alternatively organise an armed\nrevolution. When I was very young,\nmy mother once bemoaned about\nbeing past it once you were forty.\nIt seems more lamentable that the\nopposite is now the case.\nOur Man in Dam\nAnonymous\nI\nmperial College London has a\n\u00a33.9 million stake in the arms\nindustry, according to a report\nin the London Student. The\nreport, published on Monday\n27th January, details the shares that\nLondon universities have invested\nin various arms companies. Imperial\nhas by far the largest stake with \u00a33.9\nmillion out of a total of \u00a37.4 million.\nMore specifically: Imperial has \u00a31.75\nmillion invested in General Electric,\n\u00a3922 thousand in Inmarsat, \u00a3489\nthousand in Texas Instruments and\n\u00a3753 thousand in Rolls Royce. The\nreport says Imperial College refused\nto comment on its holdings. To my\nknowledge, it has yet to change this\ndecision.\nTo give a brief and perhaps\nselective account of the companies:\nInmarsat \u2018provides mobile satellite\ncommunications services\u2019. Two of its\nfour dedicated \u2018market-facing business\nunits\u2019 are focussed on \u2018government\nopportunities, both military and civil\u2019.\nOne of them boasts that Inmarsat\nis \u2018the frontline of mission-critical\ncommunications for US government.\u2019\nThe board of directors contains one\nAdmiral James Ellis who apparently\nserved in Vietnam, the Gulf War and\nis now serving as a Director of arms\nindustry giant Lockheed Martin.\nSome Imperial students may recognise\nCEO Rupert Pearce; he has lectured as\na visiting fellow on Imperial College\nBusiness School\u2019s Entrepreneurship\nprogram.\nGeneral Electric, meanwhile, has\nplayed a key role in the development\nof Obama\u2019s Drone war. As they say\nin an advertising brochure: \u2018the\nconcept of unmanned aerial systems\n\u2026 is revolutionising the way military\ninformation is gathered and even how\nadversaries are engaged. GE Intelligent\nPlatforms has been there every step\nof the way.\u2019 I assume this means that\nthey accept legal responsibility for any\ndrone attacks that do occur? Still, legal\nculpability seems unlikely since British\njudges threw out Noor Khan\u2019s appeal\nfor justice against the GCHQ, which\naccording to legal charity Reprieve\npassed on locational information to\nthe CIA \u2013 resulting in the death of\nKhan\u2019s father. Apparently, this case\nwas not \u2018exceptional\u2019 enough for to\n\u2018sit in judgement\u2019 of a foreign power.\nThis may well be true: at least 4700\npeople have been executed without\ntrial (\u2018murdered\u2019?) by drone attacks.\nWhat\u2019s one more in 4700?\nGeneral Electric have a slew of\nother dubious claims to fame, be\nit corruption during the sale of\nfighter jets to Israel or one of the\nworst environmental and nuclear\nsafety records in the world. As for\nTexas Instruments, allow me to just\nquote its \u2018High Reliability\u2019 (HiRel)\nsub-group: \u2018it is HiRel's vision to be\nthe world's number one supplier of\nsemiconductor-based products and\nservices to the defense and aerospace\nmarkets\u2019.\nFinally, Rolls-Royce is one of those\nquintessentially British institutions,\nand its fortunes were made by some\nquintessentially British characters.\nFollowing the colossal military failure\ninKutal-Amara,themassiveoperation\nrequired to take Mesopotamia (Iraq),\nand the incredible unpopularity of\nthe new liberators (sound familiar?)\nwhich culminated in armed revolt in\n1920, Secretary of State for War and\nAir Winston Churchill was working\nout the best way to reduce military\ncosts in Baghdad. Much of the cabinet\nwas surprised when PM Lloyd George\nhad cavalierly told Secretary of State\nfor War Winston Churchill that he\nwas to \u2018take air with him\u2019 also. As an\nRAF book puts it \u2018Lloyd George knew\nthat Churchill was more air-minded\nthan most of his political colleagues\u2019.\nThus Churchill was acting in character\nwhen he asked father of the RAF, Hugh\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nTrenchard, if he would be willing\nto take on Iraq. This proved to be a\njudicious decision; the subsequent\nmilitary and economic success of the\nRAF in Iraq had proven the tactical\nadvantages that airpower could afford.\nAircraft also had their uses in purely\nadministrative matters. It seems that\nwhen Churchill learnt that aerial\naction had been taken to aid in tax\ncollection \u2013 that is, villages bombed\nfor not paying taxes \u2013 even the British\nbulldog balked. However he soon got\nover his finer scruples: when asked by\nTrenchard if he wanted to \u2018stifle the\ngrowing infant\u2019 Churchill replied he\nwas behind airpower \u2018in every way.\u2019\nThis should come as no surprise; this\nis the man who couldn\u2019t understand\n\u2018this squeamishness about the use of\ngas\u2019 against \u2018uncivilised tribes\u2019 and\n\u2018recalcitrant Arabs.\u2019\nOf the planes deployed in Iraq at the\ntime the Bristol Fighter was designed\naround a Rolls-Royce engine.\nHowever the true impact on RollsRoyce was due to the RAF\u2019s expansion\nfollowing operations in Iraq, such that\nby the late-20s aeroplane engines were\nthe mainstay of Rolls-Royce Ltd. By\nthe time Henry Royce died in 1933, he\nhad designed the Merlin aero-engine\nwhich was to be used in the most\nfamous British aircraft of WWII, the\nSpitfire. Thus, in 1934 it is touching\nto see Lloyd George keen to keep this\nlegacy alive.\nOur stake in the arms industry\nrolls-royce.com\nIronic revelations in a record shop? How hipster...\n\n"

RAG President, Callum Kirk\nwas left stunned by the band Titch Bits\nsaying he was \u201cdistracted\u201d by the shiny\npurple hat and tie, and the Deputy\nPresident of the Union, Nat Kempston,\nwas simply speechless after William\u2019s\nartistic dance performance. There was\neven a surprise Michael Jackson dance\ndone by a man in a white suit, known\nonly as Fabio. No one knows where\nhe came from or how he managed to\nfit himself into the program but all\nwe know is he can dance! The casting\nof the votes was preceded by the\nmuch-awaited raffle draw which had\nsome amazing prizes such as a flight\nsimulation and bottles of wine. The\naudience was able to vote with 40% of\nthe votes counted for by the audience\nand 60% from the judges, which led\nto very close positions. Third place\nwent to The Techtonics, who treated\nthe audience to a variety of songs\nfrom \u2018Let Her Go\u2019 by Passenger to\n\u2018Earthquake\u2019 By Labrinth, whilst\nsecond place went to the Salsa dance\nby Alice & Oz. Finally, the winner of\nImperial\u2019s Got Talent 2014 was the\nCGCU President Lejon and his band,\nreclaiming the title they won in 2010!\nThe after-party was kicked off by the\nheadline act ZAR who sang some\nfavourites such as \u2018Life Ain\u2019t Easy\u2019.\nA huge congratulation to all the\nperformers, committee and thank you\nto everyone that helped support ICU\nRAG Save the Children. See you next\nyear!\nThe Case of the Man who\nDefeated Death\nAnisa Nomaan on Imperial\u2019s recent talent competiton\nT\nhe crime scene was everything short of spectacular. The crowd\ngathered on top of the hillside to experience the rudimental\nproceeding. Some with tears in their eyes, a helpless sorrow for\nthe convicted, some with ridicule on their tongues and pride\nin their hearts. Others simply indifferent. Three people put on\ndisplay: beaten, mocked and hung out to die, their clothes cast for keeps.\nAnd they did die. Their limp, lifeless bodies dragged down from the nails on\nwhich they hung to be buried with the earth from whence they came.\nAs I stated before, the crime scene was unimpressive as was the crime, for\nmany have been killed for crimes they did not commit. What came after,\nhowever, was a marvel that would leave even Sherlock Holmes bewildered.\nFor though three died that same day, only one rose on the third day, his being\nas intact as it was before he entered the tomb. No pulse ball was inserted\nbetween his arm and body or face copy placed on his dead arch nemesis.\nHe literally defeated death. But how did he do the undoable? How could he\ndefeat death without a landing cushion to break his fall?\nThe clues were there from the beginning. Before his immaculate conception,\nprophecies proclaimed that one would come, like a lamb to the slaughter,\nto die for all and in doing so conquer death. His sinless life alongside the\nmiracles he did were clues that this despised man was the Messiah told of\nfrom the beginning. He was the Saviour that came to redeem his people\nfrom destruction. But why did He do it? And how does something that\noccurred over 2000 years ago affect us today? Perhaps the larger mystery is\nnot that he was resurrected, but that he defeated death so that those that had\nrejected, and would continue to reject, him could have eternal life.\nTo investigate this theory, Imperial College Christian Union is hosting a\nseries of lunch talks from February 10th to the 14th as well as two evening\nevents on the Tuesday and Thursday entitled \u201cJesus: Case Closed?\u201d The talks\nwill be 20 minutes long at 12:00 and again at 1:00 with free lunch provided\nand a Q&A afterword. For more information visit: iccu.co.uk/case_closed.\nphp. Whether you\u2019re fervently interested or simply want a free meal, come\nalong as various speakers discuss religion, God, the Bible and the case of\nJesus, because although this case may seem unimportant to some, it is, my\ndear reader, far from elementary.\nIC Christian Union\n\n"

I\u2019m a huge fan of that\nsound, and this is one of the better\nexamples of it. There was one slower\nsong, The Fifties, was a really tender\nand beautiful track that I became fairly\nobsessed with, but more importantly,\ngave me hope for the follow up. They\nwere clearly a band with more to\noffer, so I promised myself to listen\nto their next effort immediately. Keep\nDoing What You\u2019re Doing came out in\nJanuary, and I\u2019m glad I was so prompt\nlistening to it.\nYou Blew It! Don\u2019t Blow It\nThe opening track is the absolutely\nexcellent Match & Tinder. It\u2019s an\nupbeat pop-punk-esque emo track,\nwith a pounding drumbeat and a\nreally catchy chorus. It sounds like a\ncheerful Snowing or a gruff Dowsing\n(emo bands really love the present\nparticiple). The song isn\u2019t explicity\nabout Tinder, but the lyrics are still\nreally great. I have a feeling my\nhousemates are going to get pretty\npissed off at me singing this chorus\nover and over again during the next\nfew weeks.\nAward of the Year Award comes in\nlike an Into It. Over It. (emo bands\nalso really love punctuation) track and\npretty much sticks with that theme,\nalthough the much more gravelly\nvocals are a nice change. Strong Island\nis the first track that sounds like\nmore typical midwest emo. A pulsing\nbassline, whiney vocals and twinkly\nStuart Masson reviews the Florida band\u2019s sophomore effort\nEmiel\u2019s Guide to\nWelcome back to my history of\nwestern music. Just before the\nChristmas break we discussed\na composer named Guillaume\nde Machaut and the fascinating\ndevelopments that set literate music\noff on its own course. Notated music\nspread like wildfire throughout\nEurope and the proportion of\ncomposers who would still be\nremembered today skyrocketed.\nThe course of music from here on\nbecomes more and more complex,\nand I can no longer attempt to\npresent as straightforward a\nnarrative as I have done. Instead, I\nwill continue by discussing with you\nthe major composers and styles so as\nto remain relevant to the listening\nof a modern audience. On the other\nhand, during the 14th Century,\ntechniques were shared throughout\nthe continent \u2013 music became\ninternationalised, and perhaps we\ncould argue that in the very long-term, it also became homogenised as\ndiverse European musical cultures\ninteracted and mixed.\nA few regional styles still remained\nprominent throughout the 14th\nCentury. The Ars Subtilior of\nsouthern France had an obsession\nwith complexity and further\nsubtleties; composers often invented\nnew forms of notation in order to\ncommunicate these. In Italy the\nTrecento style became dominant,\nwith Francesco Landini, a blind\norganist, setting the tone. Landini\nworked in the republic of Florence\nand wrote music for the urbane\nand sophisticated mercantile elites.\nThe British Isles too had been\nsomewhat isolated and composers\nhad developed many peculiar and\nunique styles, such as the descant\nEpisode 5 - The Renaissance\n\u2013 a particular set of intervals used\nbetween 3 voices moving in parallel.\nHowever, now the great musical\nunification of Europe was beginning\n- the so-called \u2018Renaissance\u2019 and\ncomposers could draw on many\nof these styles in their own music.\nGuillaume Dufay (1397-1474), a\nNetherlandish composer, was the first\nto gain fame across the continent. He\nhimself travelled extensively between\nFrance and Italy and even worked for\nthe Pope. Despite being the last major\ncomposer to use medieval rhythmic\nstructures, Dufay\u2019s music is celebrated\nfor its fluid rhythms and memorable\nmelodies, but his most interesting\ncontributions are harmonic. Hopefully\nyou recall Pythagoras\u2019 discovery that\nmore consonant intervals are the\nresult of simpler frequency ratios, and\nremember that until this point most\ncomposers had been concerned with\nonly the most consonant of these \u2013\nthe 5th and the 4th. More dissonant\nintervals were treated as \u2018steppingstones\u2019 in moving polyphonically (i.e.\nmultiple voices) from one consonance\nto another. Now, Dufay borrowed\nfrom the English the extensive use\nof 3rds and 6ths, giving his music\nan unprecedented richness and\nsweetness of sound. Importantly, these\nharmonies were still considered too\ndissonant to finish on, but were used\npurely for the character of their sound.\nThis represents an important change\nin the way music was considered:\nnow free from loftier religious\naims and appreciated purely as an\nauditory art and for composer\u2019s skilful\ncraftsmanship.\nThanks in part to the contributions\nof Dufay, the \u2018Franco-Netherlandish\u2019\nstyle of polyphony would come to\ndominate European music throughout\nthe Renaissance. The next major\nfigure was Johannes Ockeghem\n(1410-1497), also born in present-day\nBelgium. Ockeghem worked at the\nroyal courts for most of his life, but\nbecame a canon at the now familiar\nNotre Dame Cathedral. He made a\ngreat fortune throughout his long life,\nand was famed for his robust build and\ndeep voice. Ockeghem, like Machaut or\nPerotin, continued the development\nof polyphonic complexity but at an\nunprecedented scale. Indeed, much\nof his music is organised according to\nan incredibly complex \u2018superstructure\u2019,\noften so subtle that its existence was\nnot discovered until much later. For\nexample, the Missa Prolationum\nis made of multiple movements,\neach containing two separate yet\nsimultaneous \u2018canons\u2019 (complicated\ntypes of \u2018rounds\u2019) with each part\nmoving at different pace. These\ningenious structures work to underlie\na \u201ctimeless flow\u201d of polyphony.\nOckeghem extended the range of all\nthe voices - overlapping them so that\neach gained a new independence and\nimportance, and he avoided cadences\n(resolutions) except at key moments,\ngiving these a structural purpose and\ncreating a sort of floating sensation.\nWe have now reached a point where\nmusic has become a truly creative art,\nand the composers we discuss could\nfairly be labelled as \u2018geniuses\u2019. We are\nentering a time of new richness and\ndiversity and of great innovations\nwhich will eventually lead develop into\nthe musical system familiar to us all.\nMy descriptions of this wealth will be\nnecessarily poor in comparison to the\nmusic itself, so as always please check\nthe Felix websites for musical excerpts,\nand I look forward to introducing\nyou next week to perhaps the greatest\nmusical genius yet; Josquin des Prez.\nClassical Music\nEmiel de Lange\nguitars work together to form another\npretty decent track.\nRegional Dialect opens with a similar\ntraditional emo sound, but then opens\nup into a heavier sound. Lyrically it\u2019s\nabsolutely superb. It\u2019s a track about\na friend who\u2019s overindulging in\nnarcotics and some of the lines here\nare just incredible. I wouldn\u2019t normally\nquote lyrics in a review but when\nthey\u2019re as good as \u201cyou won\u2019t find a\ndrug you can take to forget this\u201d then I\nfeel like I need to indulge myself. The\nhighlight is the final crushing couplet:\n\u201cfor every good thing I could say about\nyou, there\u2019s a great reason why I refuse\nto\u201d. It\u2019s solid gold from start to finish.\nUp next comes a couple of tracks I\ndon\u2019t care for as much. House Address\nstarts slow and builds up to a nice\ncrescendo, but that\u2019s only at the one\nminute mark and the song is nearly\nfive minutes long. There\u2019s lots of good\nideas here, but it\u2019s a bit overblown and\ndefinitely too drawn out. A Different\nKind of Kindling opens with bare\nvocals. It\u2019s a brave decision and one\nthat I think backfires pretty badly.\nUpon every listen I\u2019m expecting a\nwhole track to kick in halfway through\nthe first line, but then it doesn\u2019t and\nit\u2019s just awkward. Emo singers are not\nknown for being in key, and this is no\nexception. It\u2019s a shame, because if the\nwhole track had kicked in half way\nthrough the first line it would have\nbeen a really good track.\nLuckily, You Blew It! really pick it\nup with the rest of the album. Rock\nSprings does the slowed down punky\nemo thing really well. It\u2019s what Dads\ntried to do with their latest EP, except,\nyou know, it\u2019s really good. The ending,\nwith its superb instrumental section\nfollowed by one last furiously shouted\nchorus, is just sublime. You & Me &\nMe goes back to the more delicate\napproach, but it\u2019s no less good. The\nlyrics are great, the vocals are great,\nhell, the whole damn track is great.\nAgain, it\u2019s fairly comparable to Into\nIt. Over It., but it\u2019s also better than\nanything on Intersections [most recent\nII.OI. album].\nGray Matter is punky, twinkly and\nbrilliant. It\u2019s a great example of why\nemo is such an exciting genre at the\nmoment. There\u2019s fury, but it\u2019s so well\nchannelled. This is anger at its most\nintelligent. The riffs hit hard in sound,\nthe lyrics hit hard in content and the\nwhole thing is just brought together\nso well.\nThe final track, Better to Best,\ncertainly isn\u2019t the highlight of the\nalbum, but it is a great ending. A\nsparse intro leads into an almost\neuphoric crescendo with wall of sound\nguitars and wordless chants. This wall\nof sound is interspersed with sections\nof sparser guitars and lyrics, before\nthe two are combined for a euphoric\nending of almost hilariously emo\nproportions. The repeated refrain of\n\u201cmaybe things aren\u2019t quite as bad as\nI let myself believe\u201d really shouldn\u2019t\nwork, but it does. It really does. It\u2019s\nsuch a good way to end the album.\nThis is everything I wanted it to be.\nThe vast majority of the tracks are\ngreat. In fact, it\u2019s a much better record\nthan the debut. They\u2019ve definitely\ngrown up, dude (sorry). This is\nmore cohesive, more varied and the\ntracks are better. The heavier tracks\nare fantastic from a songwriting\nperspective. The softer tracks are\nbeautiful from a lyrical perspective.\nThere\u2019s several which are fantastic\nat both. It\u2019s refreshing to see a band\nattempt some progression, and it\u2019s\ngreat that it worked so well. Hopefully\nthey\u2019ll keep doing what they\u2019re doing\n(really sorry) and just keep getting\nbetter. Until then, listen to this.\n\n"

A\nrecent publication created over 18,000\nhuman cell lines, each with a different\ngene removed, while the time taken to\nproduce a mouse with a gene knocked\nout has been slashed from months to a\nmatter of weeks.\nMice are commonly used for\ninvestigating human disease, but in\nmany cases the biological systems are\ntoo different to act as a meaningful\nmodel. This is particularly true\nin neuroscience, where research\ninto disorders such as autism and\nschizophrenia relies on behavioural\nanalysis, which can be difficult in\nmice.\nThese latest results, published in\nCell, show for the first time that this\nmechanism works in whole primates,\nnot just in cell lines. This development\nbringsaboutthepotentialforknocking\nout specific genes in primates, giving\nmore realistic models of human\ndisease. By targeting genes involved in\ndiseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease,\nour understanding of how this disease\ndevelops and how it may be treated\ncould be greatly increased.\nHowever, using primates brings with\nit many problems. Keeping a primate\nis much more expensive and time-consuming than housing mice, and\nresearchers working on non-human\nprimates have regularly been the\ntarget of anti-vivisection protestors.\nWhile it is possible for a single\ninstitution to contain mouse models\nfor many diseases, each with a\ndifferent gene removed, it is hard to\nimagine many universities having the\nspace or budget to house many nonhuman primate models.\nIt remains to be seen just how\nthe new technology affects the use\nof primates in research. Currently\navailable methods for knocking out\ngenes in primates rely on infection\nwith a virus, giving unpredictable\nand inefficient results. This new\ntechnology give a more accurate,\ncheaper and faster way of removing\ngenes, which could make primate\nresearch much more efficient.\nAn alternative to using primate\nmodels is to grow human cells or\ntissues in the lab and target these.\nWhilst these will not fully recapitulate\nthe disease as seen in the whole\nbody, the fact that they are made up\nof human cells is a huge advantage,\nhelping to avoid many of the ethical\nproblems posed by animal models\nand potentially giving a more realistic\nmodel of the disease.\nDOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.027\nThese twin cynomolgus monkeys, Ningning and Mingming, truly are special snowflakes\nWaterjet printer set to make a splash\nAnand Jagatia\nScience Writer\nNature Communications, Sean Xiao-An Zhang et al\nCell, Niu et al\n\u2018D\ni s a p p e a r i n g\nink\u2019 generally\nconjures up\nimages of spies\nand secret\nmessages. Until now, attempts to\ncreate a disappearing ink have been\nexpensive (and sometimes toxic), with\nthe results appearing rather faint on\nthe page. But researchers from China\nhave come up with a solution that uses\nnothing but plain old water.\nThe secret, though, lies in the paper.\nThe team came up with a special\nkind of coating which changes colour\nwhen it reacts with water. Over time\nthe water evaporates and the dye\nbecomes invisible again, meaning the\npaper is completely reusable. At room\ntemperature, the paper would dry out\nin just under a day. At 70C, the ink\ndisappears in just 30 seconds.\nImportantly, the technology can\nbe used with existing inkjet printers\n- the team simply replaced the ink in\na printer cartridge with water using\na syringe. A single sheet of paper can\nbe re-used up to 50 times, and based\non this sort of usage the technology\nwould be a mere 1% of the cost of\nstandard inkjet printing.\nThe process used to treat the paper\ndoes make it slightly more expensive,\nbut only around 5% more so than\nnormal paper, meaning overall the\ntechnology is very cost-effective.\nAs well as being cheap, using a\ntechnology like this in offices and\nschools would have significant\nbenefits for the environment.\nAccording to some studies, up to 40%\nof office prints are thrown away after\njust one reading, so water-jet printing\nwould also save reams of paper and\nthousands of trees.\nAt the moment, the printers can\nonly produce one colour at a time,\nfrom a selection of blue, magenta,\ngold and purple. From pictures of the\ngroup\u2019s first attempts, writing looks\nclear and accurate - certainly good\nenough for general use. The next step\nwill be to improve the resolution, and\nto enable the printing multiple colours\nfor images.\nDOI: 10.1038/ncomms4044\n\n"

    "content": "35\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 07 FEB\nGAMES\nQuizUp: Upping the game\nMedic Training Simulator\nThere are a ton of simulator games\nout there. For people who want to try\ntheir hand at Farming, driving a bus,\nor mining a stone quarry there are\nsimulator games out there for you!\nThese games portray all the elements\nyou need to master to be successful in\nthese games, often sacrificing fun in\ntheir quest to be 100% accurate. This\nweek, Felix games tried out a simulator\ngame that defies the convention\nand does the exact opposite of this.\nSurgeon simulator definitely includes\nmore fun than accuracy and is one\nof the most hilarious games I\u2019ve ever\nplayed.\nSurgeon simulator, unlike every\nother simulator game, has very simple\ncontrols. You can orient and move\none hand in space with the mouse\nand move each finger in and out with\na different button. The first challenge\nof the game is to select a mission. You\nstart off in a surgery office and must\nimmediately move your hand around\nto select a surgery from the clip pad.\nEverything in the game is interactive\nand this provides added fun through\nthe often funnily named achievements\nthat pop up. For example you get an\nachievement for making the rock\nhorns with your hands, or creating a\ntime lord by inserting two hearts into\nyour patient.\nThe surgeries (transplants) normally\ntake the same steps to complete. First\nyou must remove as much as you\npossibly can, including the required\norgan that you are transplanting.\nSometimes this is easy; remove the\nribs with a hammer, the intestines\na hacksaw, etc. Often times it is not\nas easy as it sounds as you have to\ncarefully cut certain connecting\narteries before you are able to rip\nout the organs and this coupled with\nthe awkward controls makes the\ngame hard. This is where the humour\nsaves the game. Sometimes you are\nfrustrated after \u201caccidently\u201d killing the\npatient but you are laughing too much\nto care. The game teaches you that\nso much can go wrong with surgery,\nyou can drug yourself, electrocute\nyourself, have a precision cutting laser\nfly around the room as you forget to\nput it back in its container but the\nsatisfaction of removing parts of a\npatient and successfully performing a\ntransplant makes up for this.\nSurgeon simulator gives you a rating\nat the end of each mission which\nprovides replay value and has different\nmodes of surgery. Once you\u2019ve\ncompleted the 3 basic surgeries (heart,\nkidney and brain transplants) you can\nrepeat them again from the back of an\nambulance. Ambulance mode is much\nharder as the driver seems to go very\nfast over every speed bump they can\nfind sending tools and parts of the\npatient flying (to be fair this is how I\nwould drive in an ambulance driver\nsimulator game). You can even loose\nparts out the back of the ambulance\nwhich makes you creative as you try\nto perform the surgery having lost\nthe \u201ccorrect\u201d tools. Another special\nmode worth mentioning is the uber\nheart transplant surgery which sees\nyou as a medic from Team Fortress 2\nperforming a heart transplant on one\nof your fallen team mates. This mode\nhowever gives you team fortress 2\nitems such as the engineers wrench to\nperform the surgery which makes for\na very messy time. My patient died in\nthis mode because they were slowly\nbleeding out after I\u2019d removed the\nheart and I failed to find the new one.\nOverall Surgeon Simulator is an\nentertaining game that does not take\nitself too seriously. It looks good\nvisually, provides a unique game\nexperience and offers much for its\nprice of \u00a36.99. It\u2019s a game that can be\nenjoyed by all. Completionists can\nlook forward to finding all the games\nsecrets and unlocking the games\nachievements, the hardcore among\nyou can speed run the game or you\ncan just enjoy doing the occasional\nsurgery now and then. Personally I\nlike to play this game with a cup of tea\nwhile in my pyjamas which is maybe\nwhy I\u2019m not very good at it. This\ngame won\u2019t teach you to be a surgeon\nbut it will provide you with hours of\nentertainment and is definitely worth\npicking up.\nI woke up to find myself cold and\nthirsty on beach in Chernarus. All\nI had on me was the clothes I was\nwearing and a flashlight. Time to\nsurvive the Zombie apocalypse. I\nhad no clue at all where I was, all\nI knew was that my stomach was\ngrumbling, my throat was parched\nandwithoutanysortofnourishment\nI would not survive till the next day.\nI pushed myself up from the grass\nI was sitting on, and gazed at my\nsurroundings. In the distance I saw\nan industrial complex, and although\nI had not much hope that I would\nfind anything of use there, I made\nmy way over there.\nHowever as I approached, I saw an\naxe-wielding man trying to kill an\nempty handed guy facing off. Since\nI was weak I decide to sit this one\nout. This was a prudent choice, as\nit seemed that the axe-wielder was\nnot very friendly and consequently\nbashed the other guys face. As I\nwaited for axe-man to loot the\nbody and clear out, I hoped that\nthere would still be something for\nme to find once the body had been\nstripped clean. I waited about for\nabout 20 minutes, my stomach\noccasionally growling. It felt like\nthe longest wait of my life Then\nwhen I felt like it was safe time to\ncome out, I did. At this point I was\naware, that if I didn\u2019t find anything\nto eat or drink, I would die. I was\nfeeling weak, and falling in and out\nof consciousness. I crawled towards\nthe body, praying for mercy. As I\nopened up his backpack my eyes fell\nupon the two most beautiful things\nI had ever seen. A bag of rice and a\nhalf-full water bottle nestled sweetly\ninside. I ate half the bag, and drank\nthe entire bottle of water. The world\naround me looked so much brighter.\nNow I had a chance at surviving.\nTime to go, I strapped the dead\nman\u2019s backpack on and strode in to\nthe sunset.\nDayZ Stories\nThe DayZ standalone has been\nreleased, and given the amazing\nstories that occur in that game, I\ndecided to make a kind of series\nout it! So here it goes:\nEpisode 2:\nAnna\u2019s Hunger\nCalum Skene\nGames Editor\nTransplanting the fun back into simulator games\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor T\nhis is not the kind game that\nour section would usually\nreview. In fact, when I told\nmy fellow games editor\nCalum what I was planning\nto write about, he retorted in disgust\n\u201cthat\u2019s not a proper game!\u201d However,\nI believe that mobile gaming is here\nto stay, which means that we should\nstart considering them. Also, the\naddictiveness of QuizUp could not be\ndiscounted.\nSo for all of those of you who do\nnot know what this game is, let me\nquickly give you the low down on this\nsuper app. It\u2019s a free game created by\nPlan Vanilla Corp which is currently\nonly on iOS. Basically a trivia quiz, it\nencompasses more than 350 topics for\nyou to show off your knowledge. You\nsubject you level up in.\nConsidering that each game lasts\nmaximum a minute, and you almost\nimmediately know if you are going\nto win it is a great way to kill a few\nminutes if you are waiting.\nSo why do I think that you should get\nthis app? Well its free (you can pay for\nexperience boosts if you really want\nto), it\u2019s a great way to learn random\nfacts that you may never encounter at\nImperial (like the only beer that Ernest\nHemmingway endorsed in his life),\nand it\u2019s a great ice-breaker (I mean, if\nyou are too awkward to actually ask\nsomeone out, you could always ask\nthem on a subject that implies what\nyou want). Come all you quizmasters\nout there, time to answer ALL the\nquestions!\nanswer 7 multiple choice questions in\na game, attempting to answer as fast\nas possible.\nThe longer it takes for you to answer\nthe less points you get for the answer.\nHowever the twist is that you play can\nreal-timeversusothersontheInternet,\nchallenging for title of greatest know-it-all across the globe. Furthermore if\nyou link your Facebook account to the\ngame you can play your friends! This\ncompetitive element does add a lot to\nme wanting to play.\nAnother element that adds to the\ncompulsive nature of the game is\nthe levelling and experience that\naccompany each result after a round\nof the quiz. Not only can you show off\nyour supremeness of your brain, but\nyou can also gain titles related to the\nMax Eggl on the sensation storming the nation\n\n"

He was previously\nstudying at UPenn and saw the idea\nwas successful in the States; we tried\nto do something similar in London,\nunfortunately it didn\u2019t work as well\nas we had liked. I am working on\nTavistock full time with my business\npartner Luke; it has grown very\nquickly in countries and areas that we\nwouldn\u2019t have expected any business\nfrom.\nNM: How did you start up Tavistock\nTutors?\nME: It was set up when I was in\nschool at 17 with Luke, we grew up in\nsame area so knew each other since\nwe were kids. I had used tutors from\nother agencies and had found some\nwere charging 45-50% commission.\nSo I set up my own agency with Luke.\nI left school to focus on it full time and\nwaited for Luke to finish his A-levels\nbefore I started University at Regents\nBusiness School.\nNM: Are you looking at starting\nother businesses or are you solely\nhoping to focus on Tavistock?\nME: I am looking into things, but\nit is hard to say what might happen.\nSteve Jobs talks about connecting\nthe dots; you can connect the dots\nlooking back but you can\u2019t connect\nthem looking forward. At the moment\nTavistock Tutors is my business\nand my priority. As I am generally\ninterested in business there are things\nI have come across and looked into\nand read about, whether or not I make\nit a priority to dedicate a significant\ntime towards something other than\nTavistock Tutors is something I am\nnot a hundred percent sure about. I\nam interested in wells out there and it\nis difficult to say what might happen\nten years down the line and what else\nI might want to do then.\nNM: How did you set up Tavistock\nTutors and how are you different to\nother similar businesses?\nME: When I started online at\nwww.tavistocktutors.com, we were\nnot able to get certain tutors other\nagencies had. Some agencies only\nrecruited from Oxbridge and Ivy\nLeague universities from the states,\njust generally the best universities\nin the world. I was 17 years old and\ndidn\u2019t have any money to start out, so\nI was out and about trying to recruit\nwherever I could. I called up heads\nof departments of universities to get\nthem to refer students and postgrads.\nAt the beginning our rates were far\ncheaper than our general competitors.\nAt that time rates were cheaper than\nothers. Most competitors are charging\n\u00a355-60 an hour at the moment, we\nare significantly cheaper than them\noften offering the same tutor at at\n\u00a340 an hour. The tutors were still\ngetting paid about the same whether\nthey were working with us or them as\nwe take a smaller commission than\nour competitors. At the beginning\nwe had lower overheads than other\ncompanies so we could afford to do\nthat, even now we are still able to do\nthat. I am amazed by the fact some\nagencies take 50% commission for\nlessons on an ongoing basis.\nNM: How did you put together\nlogistics and figure everything out?\nWas it trial and error or did you have\nsomeone helping you?\nME: We didn\u2019t have anyone helping\nout, it was mainly Luke and I trying\nto organise things and a big part was\ntrial and error. We spoke to other\nagencies to find out how much they\nwere charging and spoke to tutors to\nfind out how much they were getting\npaid, so we basically tried to find\nas many faults as possible with the\nsystem. Other agencies were not very\ntransparent and tutors weren\u2019t aware\nof what was happening. We are the\ncheapest in comparison to our direct\ncompetitors and feel it\u2019s good to be\ntransparent with our rates.\nNM: What things have been the\nbiggest obstacles in the businesses\nyou have been with?\nME: Obstacles are ongoing. With\nTavistock it was difficult starting with\nno money, we needed to get our name\nout there. It is easy to go to printing\nshops and have them hand out leaflets\non the street, but so many leaflets get\nthrown in the bin, so we wanted to do\nsomething different. I saw a bicycle\nin the skip one day, I picked it up and\npainted it bright orange; it was parked\noutside different schools and worked\nas a great piece of advertisement that\nwas very cheap to do. It\u2019s hard to set\nup a business when you don\u2019t have\nmuch money and it\u2019s hard working\nlong hours and not getting paid.\nMy parents wanted me to finish my\nstudies, it was also hard to be taken\nseriously at a young age. The timing\nwas helpful in a sense as I was living\nat home; I didn\u2019t have expenses and\ndidn\u2019t need to make any money.\nWhen you are starting a business,\nit is likely that you would be\nrunning everything yourself, from\nthe accounting, HR, running the\nmarketing and managing the overall\nbusiness; it can get difficult to juggle\neverything.\nNM: What are the key skills needed\nfor a business?\nME: I believe anyone can go and set\nsomething up, it is really important to\nbe proactive and enthusiastic about\nwhat you are doing, you have to be\nprepared to work long hours. It is\nfantastic to see young people setting\nup business. 4 years after setting up\nTavistock Tutors we are working crazy\nhours, 7 days a week and 13 hour\ndays, but both Luke and I enjoy it. It\nis important to enjoy what you are\ndoing. There are lots of opportunities\ndespite the poor economy.\nNM: Any other tips?\nME: Some things work for some\npeople and they don\u2019t necessarily\nwork for others. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a\nrule book for setting up a business, but\nit\u2019s important to be different. You just\nneed to enjoy what you do. Nobody\nshould expect to make a fortune at the\nstart.\nT\navistock Tutors was set up by Marcus Ereira and Luke Shelley when\nthey were just 17 years old. A few years on, the business has grown\ntremendously and they have over 300 tutors on their books. They\nprovide private tutors for GCSE and A-levels as well as extra-curricular\nactivities. Tavistock Tutors started of advertising the company with a\nbrightly coloured orange bicycle, and now have their own G Wizz driving around\nLondon. They have clients ranging from the Far East to America and they plan to\nbe the best agency in the world. I caught up with Marcus to find out more about\nthe enthralling duo.\nNews Editor\n\n"

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 07 FEB\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHow to save a life\nDallas Buyers Club\nDirector: Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\nWriters: Craig Borten, Melisa\nWallack\nStarring: Matthew McConaughey,\nJared Leto, Jennifer Garner\nRuntime: 117 minutes\nCertification: 15\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nOnce you contract HIV, you\u2019re forever\n\u201cmarried\u201d to the condition, as Ron\nWoodroof (Matthew McConaughey)\ncorrectly points out. In Dallas Buyers\nClub, set in the 1980s when HIV and\nAIDS were relatively unknown and\ndiscrimination against the condition\nwas high, Woodroof finds himself increasingly isolated and without help.\nDespite the promise of impending\ntreatment, for those who have very\nlittle time left to live, waiting is not a\nluxury they can comfortably afford.\nWhen America\u2019s healthcare fails to\nprovide for him, he takes matters into\nhis own hands, finding options else-where, something the Food and Drugs\nAdministration (FDA) does not look\nupon kindly.\nNews of actor Rock Hudson\u2019s AIDS\ndiagnosis is enough for Woodroof to\nfire off a series of homophobic slurs.\nHe\u2019s a bull-riding, whiskey-drinking,\nwomen-loving, drug-taking, gam-bling, hellraising 100% American male\ncowboy who hates everything about\nhomosexuals with the q-word and f-word being flung around as abusive\nbanter between his similar-minded\nfriends. So Ron isn\u2019t the most likeable protagonist to say the least, and\nyou begin to wonder whether he will\never become a redeemable figure. But\nas it stands for the first half or so, Ron\nis a closed-minded, selfish SOB who\nmakes no apologies for the way he is.\nWhich is why it makes the diagnosis\neven more difficult for him to accept.\nInitially not thinking that dirty needles or unprotected sexual intercourse\ncan be causes of contracting HIV, he\nimmediately rejects the condition as a\ngay thing, and upon being told that he\nhas no more than thirty days to live,\nhe walks out not quite understanding\nthe gravity of the situation. But he isn\u2019t\nsilly enough to ignore the doctors en-tirely. The fact is he has been feeling\nvery sick lately, and given Matthew\nMcConaughey\u2019s astonishing weight\nloss it would appear Ron has lost considerable mass.\nAnd McConaughey, a long way away\nfrom the days he played sleazy, cheesy\nrom-com male leads, transforms brilliantly to an actor of such strong, solid\nversatility that the changes his portrayed character goes through in the\nrunning time of the film is an utmost\nprivilege to witness. It\u2019s not just his un-recognisable physical appearance that\nis worth commending, but his transition from a detestable abuser to helpless victim is a smooth one. His AIDS\ndiagnosis spreads fear, judgement and\nprejudice amongst people he counted\non as friends, and it\u2019s not long before\nhe\u2019s left alone and abandoned to fend\nfor himself. McConaughey is fearless,\nfaultless and supremely confident\nwith his trademark Southern swagger\nin place, which makes the line \u201cthere\nain\u2019t nothing out there can kill fucking\nRon Woodroof in 30 days\u201d sound utterly convincing.\nHis \u201cdrug-smuggling\u201d operation\nstarts from a doctor in Mexico who\nwas stripped of his license for unknown reasons. But he seems to know\nwhat he\u2019s talking about. With a clever\nscheme of setting up a \u201cBuyers Club\u201d\nin which the membership-paying individuals are given non-FDA-approved\ndrugs, (the legal loophole here being\nthat people are buying legal member-ships, not unapproved drugs) Ron\ncharges a handsome amount for each\nmember. But what originally starts out\nas a profit-making system turns into\nsomething more meaningful. So even\nnow Woodroof has his selfish qualities\nintact, he\u2019s really in it for the profits\nFinding himself a business partner of sorts, Rayon (Jared Leto) is a\ncross-dressing HIV-positive transsexual whose sass and ability to bring in\nplenty of customers help Ron\u2019s Dallas\nBuyers Club grow. Leto and McConaughey are almost certainly going to\nbe winning their Oscars this year, for\nBest Supporting Actor and Best Lead\nActor respectively, and very much de-Don Jon & Anchorman 2\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the\ntitular character in his directional\ndebut Don Jon. Clearly modelled\non the perma-tanned buffoons of\ntv shows like Jersey Shore, Don Jon\naka Jon Martello lives a methodical\nexistence consisting of pumping\nweights at the gym, preying on\ndrunk girls in clubs and above else,\nwatching copious amounts of porn.\nInstead of just being a #MEGALAD\nJon\u2019s addiction to porn starts to cause\nmore serious problems when he\nbegins seeing the beautiful Barbara\nSugarman (Scarlett Johansson);\nreal intimacy with her just does not\ncompare to cyber sex and Jon needs\nto reevaluate his life if he wants this\nto change.\nEveryone\u2019s favourite mustachioed,\nmisogynist news anchor Ron\nBurgundy is back in Anchorman 2.\nDue to his own shoddy performance\non air, Ron loses his job to his wife\nVeronica Corningstone and they\nseparate. Ron joins global news\nnetwork (GNN) in a late-night slot\nand decides that journalistic integrity\nis not for him, sensationalism ftw! His\nnew approach to reporting is a huge\nhit and earns him fame and glory but\nwill he be able to get his relationship\nwith Veronica back on track? As\nendlessly quotable as its predecessor,\nAnchorman 2 is filled with hilarious,\nnonsensical charm. Come along for a\nguaranteed good time!\nDon Jon: Tuesday February 11th\n18:30 and Thursday February 13th\n21:00\nAnchorman 2: Tuesday February\n11th 20:30 and Thursday February\n13th 18:30\nEach film is \u00a33 for Members/\u00a34 for\nNon-members\nBuy membership here: www.\nimperialcinema.co.uk\nNext week: Oldboy\nImperial Cinema\nservedly so. Together they make one\nhell of a team: they don\u2019t particularly\nlike each other, the main reason being\nRon\u2019s inability to have an open mind\n(\u201cyou know what, you don\u2019t deserve\nmy money, you homophobic asshole\u201d\nsays Rayon in one of their earlier en-counters), but it turns out the two are\nan unlikely match made in heaven.\nTogether they share snarky banter\n(\u201cwould you stop staring at her tits\nRayon, you\u2019re starting to look normal\u201d,\n\u201cGod sure was dressing the wrong\ndoll when he blessed you with a set of\nballs\u201d to list some examples), and yes,\nbelieve it or not they become friends,\nand the Buyers Club? Turns into\nsomething that\u2019s more than just about\nturning a profit.\nBut none of these come without a\nprice. With no cure, the AIDS starts\ntaking its victims one by one, and it\ndoesn\u2019t take much guessing to predict\nthat perhaps not everyone will make\nit to the end. It\u2019s incredibly heart-wrenching, given the amount of quality time that was spent with the numerous characters.\nAdding another sympathetic pair of\neyes into the picture is Jennifer Garner\u2019s role as Dr Eve Saks, a physician\nheavily involved in the care of HIV\npatients. Her close friendship with\nRayon as well as another shared with\nRon adds more perspective into the\nfilm\u2019s narrative which works to add\neven more touching drama to the plot.\nDallas Buyers Club is a film that\nknows when to play around with the\nmaterial at hand but more importantly\nwhen to let the inevitable dark reality\nto sink in. There are elements of both\nfeel-good and feel-bad films here, with\na delicate balance struck between the\ntwo. The film never extends its focus\nbeyond the Dallas area, keeping its\nstory personal and intimate, which\nworks thanks to McConaughey.\n\n"

We may be\nresponsible for choosing how ethics\ninfluence the actions of corporations\nand governments. This could mean\ncombatting the conventional wisdom\nthat profits and carbon reductions\nare conflicting interests, as have done\nmany key players such as Ikea, Phillips\nand Unilever, all of whom presented\nthe economic benefits of tackling\nclimate change at last November\u2019s\nclimate summit in Poland.\nBut first let\u2019s reflect on what\nhappens if we stick to \u201cbusiness as\nusual\u201d. Already we are seeing rising\ntemperatures, shifting rain patterns,\nunprecedented glacial melting, rising\nsea levels and increasingly common\nextreme weather leading to floods and\ndroughts. Experts across the world,\nincluding the Grantham Institute for\nClimate Change here at Imperial, are\npredicting that things will get worse\nand pose a serious threat to human\nlives, economic development and\nthe natural world. Faced with mass\ndestruction of ecosystems, increased\nspread of infectious diseases, water\nscarcity and decline in agricultural\nproduction, that future doesn\u2019t look\nbright. And of course the poorest\ncountries will suffer the most, with\nfragile economies bearing the costs of\ninfrastructure destruction.\nSo to help people, possibly like you,\nfeeling helpless up against climate\nchange, we welcome you to Go Green\nWeek. By highlighting the positives of\nwhat our university is already doing\nand introducing some great practical\nstarting points for you to become\nmore sustainable in your own life, we\nhope that you\u2019ll get engaged with \u2018the\nproblem of our generation\u2019. Tackling\nclimate change happens on many\nlevels, and as a community of 17,000\nwe really can demand that Imperial\nbehaves sustainably, whether through\ntaking investment out of fossil fuel\ncompanies or reducing energy and\nfood waste (look out for coffee cups!)\nClimate change doesn\u2019t have to be\nall doom and gloom, and there are\nlots of people and organisations doing\nproactive things all over the world with\namazing positive consequences. The\nage old myth that being sustainable\nmeans reducing your quality of life\nis simply not true! Many aspects of\n\u2018being green\u2019 will save you money,\nkeep you fit and open you up to new\nexperiences.\nFor example, we have heard in the\nnews that energy prices are at their\nhighest in this decade. Domestic\nelectricity prices, including VAT, rose\nby 7.8% in current terms between Q4\n2012 and Q4 2013. Although most\npower companies have decided to\nfreeze their bills this year, TfL didn\u2019t.\nBy walking or cycling into College,\nyou save on travelcards, and that\u2019s\nat least \u00a3800 to spend on something\nelse. Bringing your own bag for\nyour supermarket shop may also\nearn you \u201cgreen\u201d points in certain\nsupermarkets; as they say, every little\nhelps.\nWhat the College already does\nDespite scoring a third class degree in\nthe People and Planet Green League,\nthe College actually does a lot in terms\nof cutting down our emissions. All\nnew buildings are fitted with more\nenvironmentally friendly LED lighting\nand air filtering systems, while others\nare being refurbished to the same high\nstandard. Only 13% of all college waste\nwas sent to landfill in 2011-12, with\nthe rest reused, recycled, recovered\nand incinerated.\nThe on-site composter contributes\nto this figure by processing around 2\ntonnes of food waste collected from\nTasteImperial outlets each week. The\ncombined heat and power plant (CHP)\nlocated at the basement of Electrical\nand Electronic Engineering produced\n28,000MW of electricity and 25% of\nheating at South Kensington during\n2011/12, and energy produced in this\nway has an efficiency of up to 90%,\ncompared to 40% from conventional\npower plants.\nDespite this, the carbon emissions\nat College remain at a high level and\nthe related taxes stood at around\n\u00a3900,000 in 2011/12. This sizeable\namount could be put to better use if\nour emissions weren\u2019t so high.\nEasy ways to be more green\nThere are many ways to help Imperial\nto be environmentally friendly and\nmany of these are habits that don\u2019t\ntake much to change. As a starter,\nbring a reusable mug for your next\ncup of coffee and fill your reusable\nwater bottles with tap water. Bottled\nwater is costly for both your wallet\nand the environment; just think\nabout the amount of transportation\nand packaging involved! Also, BYOB.\nBy which we mean bags. Don\u2019t take\nplastic bags from supermarkets, the\nunion shop, JCR, or anywhere else. If\nyou are planning on a big shop, invest\nin a pretty reusable bag and bring it\nwith you all the time!\nWhile at uni, report any defects\nto Facilities Management. Just\ndrop an email to fm.csc@imperial.\nac.uk if you spot a leaking tap or\nyour lecture theatre is getting too\nwarm. The likelihood is nobody has\nreported a defect or problem yet\nand it\u2019s something that can easily be\nfixed. If you are leaving experiments\nto run, don\u2019t forget to close the fume\ncupboard sashes. There are over 700\nof them on campus and studies show\nthat each fume cupboard produces\nup to 9 tonnes of CO2\na year because\nair is constantly extracted from them.\nBy using them properly (i.e. not as\nstorage boxes) and closing the sashes,\nyou could save at least 10% of those\nemissions.\nWe easily forget the amount of water\nand energy that goes into making the\nmeat we consume. Why not try eating\nmeat for one day less a week? Not\nonly is a less meat-intensive diet often\ncheaper and more sustainable, but\nyou\u2019ll be less at risk to some cancers\nand heart disease. Additionally,\nwhenever you\u2019re about to enjoy a cup\nof tea or coffee (or both!), remember\nto only boil the amount of water you\nneed. Not only it would take less time\nto make your cuppa, you can also save\nenergy by only boiling the water you\nwill use.\nWhy Green Week?\nThis year is the first Green Week at\nImperial since 2011. Although some\npeople doubt the effectiveness of a\nGreen Week, we feel like it is a good\nopportunity to keep sustainability on\neveryone\u2019s radar, especially as a way\nof learning more about our actions\nwithout the hard selling, like we have\nbeen before. Hence, Imperial Hub has\ndecided to join another 80 education\ninstitutions in the UK for the \u201cGo\nGreen Week\u201d, a national initiative to\nencourage students to contribute to\nthis issue.\nIt will be a chance for you to learn\nmore about different campaigns that\nare going on and eco-friendly facilities\naround College, but also voice your\nopinions about what should be done\nto help College, and us, to be as\n\u201cgreen\u201d as possible.\nSo what\u2019s happening?\nTuesday 11th, lunchtime: Bike\nWorkshop with Bike Users Group at\nFaculty Building Bike Store. Learn\nmore about your bike and how to\nmaintain it!\nWednesday 12th, 17:30: Beekeeping\nlecture with Environmental Society at\nUnion Meeting Room 1.

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 07 FEB\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nPhilsophical Investigations\nB\neneath the differences\nbetween Wittgenstein\u2019s\nT r a c t a t u s - L o g i c o\nPhilosophicus and\nhis Philosophical\nInvestigations there is a more\nfundamental continuity between the\ntexts. This article relies heavily on two\nbooks, Alain Badiou\u2019s Wittgenstein\u2019s\nAnti-Philosophy and Saul Kripke\u2019s On\nRules and Private Languages.\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus\nSaul Kripke sums up the argument\nin Tractatus briefly: \u2018To each sentence\nthere corresponds a (possible) fact.\nIf such a fact obtains the sentence is\ntrue, if not false. For atomic sentences\nthe relation between the sentence\nand the fact it alleges is one of simple\ncorrespondence or isomorphism. \u2026\nAn atomic sentence is itself a fact,\nputting the names in a certain relation;\nand it says that \u2026 the corresponding\nobjects are in the same relation. Other\nsentences are \u2026 truth-functions of\nthese.\u2019\nKripkeadmitsthatthough\u2018therough\noutlines are well known\u2019, \u2018in the detail\nthe Tractatus is amongst the most\ndifficult of philosophical works.\u2019 If we\nlook carefully, it is not just the detail\nthat Kripke has neglected to include\nin his description of the Tractatus.\nWe see that his account is roughly\nexpressed by the following: \u2018What is\nthe case \u2013 a fact \u2013 is the existence of\na state of affairs.\u2019 (2). \u2018In a proposition\na thought finds an expression that\ncan be perceived by the senses\u2019 (3.1).\n\u2018A proposition is a picture of reality\u2019\n(4.01). \u2018A proposition represents\nthe existence and non-existence of\nstates of affairs\u2019 (4.1). \u2018A proposition\nis a truth-function of elementary\npropositions.\u2019 (5).\nNow the devil is in the detail, but\nKripke\u2019saccountinnowaynecessitates\nthree of the seven fundamental logical\npropositions \u2018The world is all that is\nthe case\u2019 (1). \u2018Bear in mind the general\nform of a truth-function.(6). \u2018What\nwe cannot speak about we must pass\nover in silence\u2019 (7). Although there is\na valid complaint that, though (6) is\nnot necessitated by Kripke\u2019s account it\nis suggested by it. Some of the \u2018detail\u2019\nwithin (6) suggest quite different\nconclusions to Kripke\u2019s own. It has\nbeen included amongst the \u2018nays\u2019\nbecause of that.\nIndeed, Kripke\u2019s account only\naccounts for the first half of\nWittgenstein\u2019s explanation in the\npreface \u2018What can be said at all can\nbe said clearly, and what we cannot\ntalk about we must pass over in\nsilence.\u2019 Much of Wittgenstein\u2019s book\nis passed over in silence because\nanalytical philosophy simply cannot\ndiscuss it without some considerable\nembarrassment. The embarrassment\nis, of course, Wittgenstein\u2019s mysticism,\nthe irrational and pessimist\nWittgenstein that appreciates\nSchopenhauer and the millenarian\nSpengler. Wittgenstein explicitly\nmakes room for his mysticism: \u2018The\nlimits of my language are the limits\nof my world.\u2019 (5.6); \u2018The sense of the\nworld must lie outside the world\u2019\n(6.41); \u2018Propositions can express\nnothing which is higher\u2019 (6.42); \u2018God\ndoes not reveal himself in the world\u2019\n(6.432); \u2018There are indeed things\nwhich cannot be put into words. They\nmake themselves manifest. They are\nwhat is mystical.\u2019 (6.522).\nIn light of the above we can\nunderstand the enigmatic final line\nof the Tractatus (\u2018Whereof we cannot\nspeak\u2026\u2019). This is not so much an\nattempt to dismiss the irrational and\nthe mystical but an explicit attempt\nto protect it. Russell reproaches\nWittgenstein for this irrational \u2018excess\u2019,\n\u2018the totalities concerning which Mr\nWittgenstein holds that it is impossible\nto speak logically are nevertheless\nthought by him to exist, and are the\nsubject-matter of his mysticism.\u2019 The\nanalyst in Russell comes through\n\u2018[abolishing the mystical] would\nleave untouched a very large part of\nMr Wittgenstein\u2019s theory, though\npossibly not the part upon which he\nhimself would wish to lay most stress.\u2019\nThis, however, moves too fast for, as\nWittgenstein was no doubt aware, if\nyou remove the mystical and its ability\nto \u2018make itself manifest\u2019, you lose the\nkey part of Wittgenstein\u2019s theory.\nThus: \u2018A picture cannot, however,\ndepict its pictorial for; it displays\nit.\u2019 (2.172); \u2018A thought can never be\nanythingillogical;ifitwerewe\u2019dhaveto\nthink illogically.\u2019 (3.03); \u2018A proposition\nshows its sense. A proposition shows\nhow things stand if it is true. And it\nsays that they do so stand.\u2019 (4.022);\n\u2018The general propositional form is\nthe essence of a proposition\u2019 (5.471).\nFinally, \u2018The propositions of logic\ndescribe the scaffolding of the world,\nor rather they represent it \u2026 It is\nclear that something about the world\nmust be indicated by the fact that\ncertain combinations of symbols &\ntautologies. This contains the decisive\npoint. Logic is not a field wherewe\nexpress our wishes with the help of\nsigns but rather, one where the nature\nof the absolutely necessary signs speak\nfor itself.\u2019 Every significant \u2018atom\u2019 of\nlanguage in the Tractatus relies on the\nself-evident manifestation of its own\nmeaning, its ability to show or display\nits logical form, and if you remove the\nability for the mystical to make itself\nmanifest then this too must apply to\nmeaning itself. This leads us to the\nInvestigations.\nPhilosophical Investigations\nDespite the description of Tractatus\nthat Kripke gives he has, undoubtedly,\na \u2018powerful philosophical intelligence\u2019\nand he very persuasively argues that\nthe \u2018sceptics paradox\u2019 described in\n(201) of the Investigations is the\ncentral problem of the Investigations.\n\u2018This was our paradox: no course of\naction could be determined by a rule,\nbecause every course of action can be\nmade out to accord with the rule.\u2019 This\nbecomes clear if we follow Kripke\u2019s\nexplicit example.\nIt is clear that I have performed a\nfinite number of computations in the\npast. Suppose that 68 plus 57 is not a\ncomputation I have ever performed\nand both 68 and 57 are greater than\nany integers I have previously used\nin an additional computation. What\nif a sceptic asserts that the correct\nanswer to the computation is, say, 5\ninstead of 125? They point out that in\nour past experience, what we called\nplus is fully consistent with a different\noperator, say quus with symbol ++,\nthat follows the rules x++y=x+y\nif x,y <57, otherwise x++y=5. The\nsceptic\u2019s point is that there is nothing\nto justify that when I said plus in the\npast I meant the operator + and not\n++, and even if I specifically thought\nof, say, the mathematical definition\nof + each time I said \u2018x plus y,\u2019 there\nis nothing to justify my use of plus to\nmean + instead of ++ this time. Both\noperations are consistent with past\nexperience and the use of one or the\nother is logically unjustifiable.\nI consider Kripke\u2019s discussion\ninformative and recommend anyone\ninterested in the Investigation to read\nit. The key point, however, is that while\nthe Investigations no longer maintain\nas the Tractatus does that \u2018whatever\ncan be said can be said clearly\u2019 (for\ninstance family resemblances instead\nof the simple correspondence between\nobject and fact), it has very little to\nsay about the \u2018whereof we cannot\nspeak\u2019. The Investigations have clearly\nquestioned the principle of the self-evident manifestation of meaning; one\nof the largely correct commonplaces\nabout the Investigations suggests that\nWittgenstein no longer maintains\nthe link between logical form and\nlanguage or the logic of meaning. Has\nWittgenstein undergone a crisis of\nfaith? This may be the philosophical\ncorollary to his growing pessimism,\nnot helped by WWII and the death\nof Frank Ramsey. Wittgenstein\nspeaks: Could we not see that as the\nreintroduction of faith into the very\nact of speaking itself?\nThis explains both the pessimism\nand the enduring preoccupation with\nsolipsism.Hispositionthattheveryact\nof speaking is to act as Kierkegaard\u2019s\nsoldier of faith is no easy burden to\nbear.Itisperhapsnosurprisethatforall\nWittgenstein\u2019s alleged \u2018behaviourism\u2019\nhe is as deeply introspective as that\nChristian existentialist. This explains\nWittgenstein\u2019s enduring desire for the\none reader who truly understands his\nproject.TheTractatusisWittgenstein\u2019s\nfirst expression of a mystical faith:\nThe fact that Wittgenstein made the\nInvestigations ready for publication\nsuggests that despite a very real\npersonal crisis, there was a more\nmature expression of the same in the\nPhilosophical Investigations.\nAll references to the Tractatus are taken from the Routledge Classics\n(2001) edition which uses the 1961 Pears and McGuinness translation\nand includes an introduction by Bertrand Russell also quoted in the text.\nReferences to the Investigation are from Blackwell\u2019s third edition of the\ntext, translated by GEM Anscombe.\n\n"

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 07 FEB\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDirector mastercla\nPeter Brook\nTreasured Writer\nLove and Death (1975)\nAllen had charmed audiences though Broadway-style comedy with heavy use of\nslapstick and gags up until this early point in his career. Love and Death follows\nin that vein and it genuinely made me laugh so loud and for such a sustained\namount of time that the residents of the flat next door complained (maybe more\na reflection on my oddly loud laugh than anything, but I hope you get the point).\nLove and Death is a period Russian satire about the cowardly, pacifist, scholar\nBoris being forced to go to war. When his brothers packed swords, he packed\na butterfly net. This film also contains many jokes for those who are interested\nin Russian literature and film, specifically Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy and Eisenstein.\nIt\u2019s watching films like this that make me realise what a dearth of comedy the\nfilm industry is undergoing at the moment.\nAnnie Hall (1977)\nThe opening monologue from Annie Hall is possibly one of the greatest openings to a film in the 120 years of cinema. It is just Allen playing Alfie Singer\ntalking against a light brown background about his philosophy on life and which\nis both terrible sad and brilliantly funny. He is both animated and a master of\ncomic timing. He then starts talking about a break-up with Annie Hall and how\nhe can\u2019t get his head around it and the movie starts and we follow Allen, I mean\nAlvy (it doesn\u2019t matter as they are basically the same person in this film) through\nthe ins and outs of his relationship.\nThough maintaining the comic sentiments of his previous films he is trying to\ndo something more now than simply make an audience laugh: he says he \u201chad\nthe courage to abandon ... just clowning around and the safety of complete broad\ncomedy. I said to myself, \u2018I think I will try and make some deeper film and not be\nas funny in the same way. And maybe there will be other values that will emerge,\nthat will be interesting or nourishing for the audience.\u2019\u201d\nFinally it is important to mention the role Diane Keaton played in this film\n(for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress); she plays Annie and\nis possibly the most believable girlfriend ever played on screen: human, affable\nand just charming.\nMidnight in Paris (2011)\nRecently Allen has stopped appearing in his own films and in Midnight\nin Paris Owen Wilson plays Woody\nAllen playing a writer. The film shows\na shaky relationship between Wilson\nand his fianc\u00e9 and her very wealthy\nand snooty parents on a trip to Paris.\nWilson wanders off and finds himself\ntransported back in time to the 1920s\nwhere he meets all of his favourite\nauthors including Hemingway and\nFitzgerald and some other famous poets and artists of the time (including a\nwonderful cameo of Adrian Brody as\nDal\u00ed). The story is really of a romance\nbetween Paris and a man, and you really feel the excitement of his attempts\nto go back in time. In some ways you\ncan see parts of the ignored craziness\nthat may come from The Discreet\nCharm of the Bourgeoisie.\nBlue Jasmine (2013)\nBlue Jasmine is Allen\u2019s film from 2013\nand can only be defined as character\nfilm. Proof that he can let is own voice\nsubside and allow another performer\nto really become the heart of the film.\nIn this case that is Cate Blanchett\nas the obnoxiously wealthy woman\nwho lost it all after her husband who\ncheated on her got caught for financial\ncrimes. Running out of money and reliant on alcohol and pills, she is forced\nto move into her sister\u2019s apartment\n(wonderfully played by Sally Hawkins) which is small and dowdy. We see\na woman who is on one hand an awfully entitled bitch, but on the other,\nsomeone who is coming apart at the\nseams and really needs help. Though\nat first it seems bold for Allen to make\na film in someone else\u2019s voice, there\nhave been rumours that this is actually a caustic attack on Mia Farrow, his\nex-partner after their strange and very\npublic relationship breakdown which\nincluded accusations of Allen\u2019s sexual\nmolestation of her children. This film\nsuddenly doesn\u2019t feel like a virtuous\nchoice to step back to allow a new\nvoice in his films.\nWoody Allen has managed to create a set of films that are defined by\nexclusively his voice. His constant\nneuroticism, his jokes and his tragic\nhunt for love. In this article I thought\nit would be interesting to see where\nhis style came from, so I have made a\nlist to compare 5 films from his Top\n10 Films (originally published in Sight\nand Sound) with some of my favourite Allen films. He made the rounds\non the stand up comedy set and I feel\nthis is where some of his immediacy\ncomes from. However his knowledge\nand clear love of cinema makes him\none of the most interesting directors\naround today and the fact that he has\nbeen making at least a movie a year\nsince 1982 makes him one of the most\nprolific too.\nA brief preamble about this article: Allen was accused of child molestation\nback in 1992, was found not guilty,\nand refused visitation rights to his\nadopted children. This has come back\ninto the public conciseness after the\nGolden Globes when Dylan Farrow,\nthe alleged victim of the abuse, released a letter to bring her accusation\nback to the public domain. The day I\nam writing this, Sunday 2nd Feburary\n2014, Dylan Farrow has published an\naccount of the alleged abuse. I finished writing this article 4 days ago,\nand hope that no one sees this as an\nattempt to \u2018cash in\u2019 on the publicity.\nWhether the accusations are true or\nnot (we rely on the reasonable doubt\nof the American Justice system) I think\nno one would argue that Allen has had\na profound influence on cinema over\nthe last 40 years and has created some\njoyous movies. That is what I wanted\nto write about when I wrote this piece.\n\n"

The\nGunners show no signs of relinquishing their clutch on top spot, although\nthey have a horrible spell of fixtures\nto contend with now and you wonder\nif Arsene Wenger has the strength in\ndepth to cope. The pressure will be\nwell and truly on both sides to win this\nand because of that I expect a cagey\ngame. However, Arsenal tend to fall\nshort against direct rivals and, since\nthe Reds were stunning versus Everton last time out at Anfield, I will tip\nthem to edge it\n1-0\nTottenham v Everton\n(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 1:30pm)\nTim Sherwood\u2019s honeymoon period\nseems to be over at White Hart Lane.\nThat spark his players had in his first 5\nmatches was missing against Man City\nand Hull, and this game will be a real\ntest of his man management skills,\nespecially with hopes hinging largely\non the exploits of the notoriously erratic Emmanuel Adebayor. Similarly,\nRoberto Martinez was given a reality\ncheck about the Toffees\u2019 top four credentials in the recent Merseyside der-by. Even though they are above Spurs\nin the table, Everton would surely take\na point at kick off and I think that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll get.\n1-1\nSwansea v Cardiff\n(Sky Sports 1, Saturday 5:30pm)\nThis will be a Welsh derby with a difference \u2013 neither the Bluebirds nor\nthe Swans can be at all sure of Premier League survival this season and\nMichael Laudrup\u2019s men will be hungry for revenge after an embarrassing\ndefeat at Cardiff in the reverse fixture.\nThey have been playing better than results suggest and finally won at home\nto Fulham last Wednesday, but then\nflattered to deceive as they slumped\nto defeat at West Ham. Ole Gunnar\nSolskjaer will be buoyed by claiming\nhis first home win against Norwich,\nbut Cardiff\u2019s away record is poor and\nSwansea\u2019s class should ultimately pre-vail.\n2-0\nMan United v Fulham\n(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 4pm)\nTeams are coming to Old Trafford\nwith belief, and coupled with recent\ninjuries I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why we are seeing United struggle. But this is a real\ngimme for David Moyes \u2013 the hapless\nCottagers will be easy pickings for van\nPersie and Rooney.\n3-0\nAston Villa v West Ham\nLast weekend\u2019s victory over Swansea\nwas bittersweet for Sam Allardyce;\nstar striker Andy Carroll\u2019s red card\nagain leaves the Hammers short up\nfront. Villa halted their home hoodoo\nversus West Brom and with Christian\nBenteke back on song they ought to\nhave enough.\n2-1\nChelsea v Newcastle\nJose Mourinho again demonstrated\nhis managerial prowess at Manchester City on Monday and the Blues\ncertainly look to have the bit between\ntheir teeth now. As last weekend\u2019s\nTyne-Wear derby showed, the Magpies have precious little to play for.\n2-0\nCrystal Palace v West Brom\nTony Pulis has an outstanding record since joining the Eagles and here\ncomes another distinctly winnable\ngame at Selhurst Park. Pepe Mel became one of few managers to taste\ndefeat at Villa Park this season and\nPalace have the incentive of rising as\nhigh as 11th.\n1-0\nNorwich v Man City\nI worry for Man City. For all their attacking nous, they remain far too vulnerable at the back. Fortunately, the\nCanaries\u2019 frontline is unlikely to cause\ntoo many problems for them; this is\na nice game for them to regain some\nconfidence after Monday\u2019s home de-feat.\n1-4\nSouthampton v Stoke\nMauricio Pochettino\u2019s Saints seem to\nhave got over their December blip,\nwith Adam Lallana in particular firing on all cylinders. Stoke caused Man\nUnited major problems last weekend\nbut their buccaneering play seldom\npays off on the road.\n2-0\nSunderland v Hull\nAt last the Black Cats are getting the\nresults they deserve \u2013 intriguingly,\nthey have great form away and for\nthat reason I cannot see them being\nrelegated. But the Tigers halted their\nrun of defeats last weekend and Steve\nBruce will be up for this on his return\nto Wearside.\n1-1\nJames White gives his midweek predictions\nS\naturday 25th January:\nthe magic of the FA Cup\nfilled the air, anticipation\nof a big upset was on the\ncards at the Etihad but\nmost importantly 14 of IC\u2019s most\ncoveted Airborne Rangers did battle\nwith St Georges 1s. Many of you are\nprobably wondering what the hell\nwent down that fateful day - Imperial\n1s vs St Georges 1s in LUSL, an 11-goal thriller and the most orgasmic of\nshowers to follow.\nArriving early and keen, IC were\nout basking in the glorious sun with\ntheir pre match routine that Captain\nRobinson seems to keep making\nlonger and longer (it\u2019s not the only\nthing he can make longer, ladies).\nThe blood was pumping to all the\nright places, and our opposition were\nbarely able to put their kit on. Their\npreparation had been diabolical and it\nwas about to show.\nFour and a half minutes of foreplay\nbefore we conducted the all-important\npenetration; Captain Robinson played\nan exquisitely lofted ball across the\nfield to Dale who took it down and\nfired his load at goal, it hit the bar but\nhe followed through and took it on\nhis forehead. The party was only just\ngetting started as Gregory played a\nthrough ball to Murphy who held off\nhis defender, despite calls of \u201cyour\nmuscles are embarrassingly small\u201d\nfrom the direction of Teddington, and\nthen skilfully dinked the ball over the\nkeeper. We took a blow in the back\ndoor, which was unusually painful as\nwe are not normally on the receiving\nend of such actions. We knew that\nevery attack had the possibility of a\ngoal, and from the restart we made\nsure we got straight to work; it paid off\nwhen their keeper was stranded in no-mans land outside of his box, allowing\nGregory to chip the ball over him. 3-1\nup and the flood gates were well and\ntruly open, Dale went on a mazing\nrun penetrating deeper and deeper\nin to the opposition half until he shot\na thunderous effort at the crossbar\nwhich cannoned down on to the goal\nline. Calls for Hawkeye technology\nto be implemented at Harlington\ndominated the post-match conference\nbut LUSL were not on hand to give a\ndefinitive statement.\nWe weren\u2019t done in the first half\nand we had plenty left in the sack,\nCaptain Robinson broke in to the box\nand pondered on the ball for a little\ntoo long. Vicious rumours circulating\nWest London suggest he had been\nconducting numerous tours the night\nbefore, leaving him a little jaded. His\ninstinct and close control allowed him\nto draw in a foul for which we were\nawarded a penalty; it was dispatched in\nto the bottom corner of the goal, well\nout of the reach of the goalkeeper. The\nnext goal went to St George\u2019s, a huge\nclearance from the half way line that\nbounced and the wind carried it over\nCasas. Did he mean it? Certainly not;\nhe does not possess the mathematical\nability to judge the trajectory, let\nalone the wind effects. Casas was\nhopelessly flailing at it; perhaps his\nfine L\u2019Oreal mop of hair got into his\neyes. No worries though, he had no\nsuch problem with those Spanish girls\nat the union. Again we rebounded\nquicker than Captain Robinson after\nrealising he had a gap in the market,\nwith Gregory slotting home from the\nleft. 5-2 at half time and we were in\nthe driving seat.\nThe second half got off in a similar\nfashion to the first, minimal foreplay\nand a whole lot of action in all the\nright areas; Dale opened the scoring\nwith a brilliant strike from the right.\nAfter being as useless as a virgin\nin bed, St Georges changed their\nhopeless striker to their BBU who\nwore a Vassell shirt; he was going to\nhave to add this day to his ongoing\nlist of miserable defeats. Despite his\nsize the BBU went down quicker than\na horny lesbian; his dive was poorly\nexecuted, with a lack of imagination\nand disgracefully poor entry in to the\npool scored him an abysmal 3.5. IC\n1s\u2019 thoughts were clearly elsewhere, as\npoor man-marking off a free kick led\nto a third St George\u2019s goal. That was as\nmuch they were going to get though;\nthe biggest money shots were about to\ncome.\nThe first came from a Nugent tackle\non the edge of the box, storming up\nthe pitch quicker than a dog on heat\nchasing a mate, slipping Gregory in\nwho finished only needing a single\ntouch. The fitness of IC was starting\nto show. Prestinoni won the ball in\nour third releasing Murphy who sped\nup the pitch along the right with\nPrestinoni and Nugent ready for the\nTesco Value goal. He almost ruined it\nbut his quick feet allowed him to round\none more player before squaring it to\nPrestinoni, who finished neatly in the\nbottom left hand corner. That rounded\noff all 8 money shots, a drenched St\nGeorges team sulked off the pitch\ncovered in shame. Job complete, an\nAirborne Ranger never leaves anyone\nfeeling dissatisfied.\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\nPeter Nugent\nIC Football\nImperial 1st XI ruthlessly slay\nSt Georges 1st XI 8-3\nIC FOOTBALL\n\n"

    "content": "31\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 07 FEB\nFILM\nass: Woody Allen\n5 of Woody Allen\u2019s Top 10 Films\nThe Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (Luis Bu\u00f1uel, 1972)\nThis is a surrealist caper by Luis Bu\u00f1el. It is a film in French which follows\nthe lives of a middle-class group who\ntry to have a dinner together. However, they are repeatedly interrupted\nor hampered from having their party\ndue to misunderstandings, invading\narmies or dead restaurant managers.\nThe film also takes place in the\ndreams of the main characters which\nreveal their biggest fears from humiliation to violent death. The dreams are\noften played as tricks on the audience\nand it often takes a while to tell whether the absurdity of the situation is in\nfact a dream or a strange situation.\nThe oddity of this film really comes\nfrom the fact that when inexplicable\nthings happen, the characters react\nas if it is the most normal thing in the\nworld and I found perverse humour in\nthat. Of all the films that Allen quoted\nin his list it\u2019s funny that one in French\nwould have a voice so similar to his\nown.\n8\u00bd (Federico Fellini, 1963)\nThis film is a dreamy masterwork\nabout making movies. It follows a famous director though the production\nof his newest film, only there is a prob-lem. He doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s about\nyet. Despite this, his producer begins\nbuilding massive sets which panics\nGuido the director and makes it harder for his creativity to flow. It is a study\nof how creativity is not something that\ncan be conjured out of nowhere.\nMuch like the surrealist Bu\u00f1el\npiece, this combines dreams and reality in a way so as to confuse the two.\nI believe that cinema is the perfect\nmedium to demonstrate the power of\ndreaming and the subliminal effects\nand tricks that it plays with your mind\ncan often leave finishing watching\na film to be akin to wake up after an\nintense dream, with the residual emotions left with as you begin to go back\nabout your day.\nOne thing I have to admit I found\nabout 8\u00bd is that the middle act feels\nquite long, but the payoff was one of\nsheer magnificence. It\u2019s the final two\nmonologues by Guido and his writer\nthat are almost spoken straight to the\naudience before a final dance and musical number that says, \u201cHell, this is\njust a movie!\u201d\nThe 400 Blows (Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut,\n1959)\nThe name comes from \u201cfaire les\nquatre cents coups\u201d, a French idiom\nmeaning to raise hell. It\u2019s the French\nNew Waves\u2019 Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off.\nThough the film starts with a sort\nlackadaisical nature the severity of\nthe story starts to spiral. The boy who\nbunks off school is reprimanded for\nlying to his parents and teachers, but\nsees his mother having an affair, he\nchooses not to repeat this as he doesn\u2019t\nbelieve anyone will believe him.\nDespite the \u2018heavy\u2019 direction of the\nfilm it is particularly light on its feet\nup until the last act and the final scene\nis both exciting and kind of sad. It\nsort of sums up everything the French\nNew Wave stood for and it breathes\nand sighes beauty. Truffaut went on\nto create a couple of sequels following\nthis boys life. However I enjoyed the\nescapist ending as it was.\nRashomon (Akira Kurosawa, 1950)\nA story of the rape and murder of a\nSamurai and his wife told from four\ndifferent perspectives, the boasting\ncriminal, the shamed wife, the ghost\nof the murdered Samurai (though a\nmedium of course) and an unbiased\nonlooker. Kurosawa, also famous for\nSeven Samurai among many others\ncreates each vivid story in such a believable and compelling way that each\nversion of events could be a movie in\nits own right.\nIt manages to dissect tabloid culture\nbefore it ever came to be in such an\ninsightful way that the \u2018Rashomon Effect\u2019 is now a term used by scholars\nand critics to describe an event told\nfrom with multiple points of view.\nThe pervading concept can also be\nfound in everything from a Spongebob\nSquarepants episode to the film Crash\n(2004).\nI won\u2019t give the ending away, and\nthough the film has a lot to offer it\nwasn\u2019t until the final sequence that I\nunderstood how this film could rate so\nhighly on Allen\u2019s list. Within the final\nsequence we see absurdity, beautiful\ncamera moves and riveting tension.\nCitizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941)\nThe bedrock of modern cinema and\nalways in the top 10 films of all time\nlists. I think that this makes it a little hard to watch, knowing that you\nshould enjoy this film above all others,\nand it obviously has merit. The section I enjoyed most however (bearing\nin mind I did actually enjoy this film)\nwas the song in the middle which reminded me of The Simpsons episode\nthat parodied the song \u201cThere is a\nman, a certain whose face and certain\ngrace is known across this land\u2026. His\nname is Burns!\u201d But again the phrase\n\u201cYou buy a bag of peanuts in this town\nand you get a song written about you!\u201d\nalso gave me a chuckle.\nMuch like Rashomon it uses the\nidea of searching for the truth behind\na story as the central tenant and this\nmay be something that Woody Allen\nis looking for when he is deciding his\nfavourite films.\n\n"

    "content": "34 FRIDAY 07 FEB\nTECHNOLOGY\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Yong Wen\nChua, Osama Awara\ntechnology.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\nReturn to paper?\nI hate wires. Every time I look at\nthe back of my PC and I see the\nbunch of wires, my OCD kicks in.\nLuckily, I can usually sit at my desk\nand pretend the wires are not there.\nNot for the mobile phone. When\nyou need to charge it, transfer data,\nor listen to music, you have to\npluck some bloody cables into it. At\nleast, you used to. I have managed\nto transition to using my mobile\nphone without needing any wires\nat all, and here\u2019s how you could do\nthe same. (Caveat: doesn\u2019t work on\nall phones; I am using a Nexus 5.)\nPower is essential to the phone.\nWithout juice, your phone might as\nwell be a formidable piece of brick\ndesigned to kill someone and then\ncommit seppuku afterwards by\nshattering into a million pieces of\nglass. The power cable gets the cut\nfirst via wireless charging. With a\nwireless charging device, you will\nno longer have to plug your phone\nto charge it. It\u2019s as convenient as\nplacing your phone on the charging\ndevice, usually in the form of a mat.\nThere are two main standards for\nwireless charging: Qi (pronounced\nchee) and Powermat. Many high\nend phones such as the Nexus 5\nand some Nokia Lumia phones\nsupport wireless charging directly.\nOthers require some kind of an addon to allow for wireless charging.\nUnless you are one of those\nannoying people who likes to\nbroadcast your music taste for the\nscrutiny of the others on public\ntransport, you would probably be\nusingsomeearphonesorheadphones\nto listen to music on the go. Your\nwireless solution to this would be\nbluetooth headsets. The price range\nis vast, and essentially, you get what\nyou pay for. If you are an audiophile,\nthe Logitech UE 9000 is probably the\nbest you can get at a hefty \u00a3300. If\nyou are willing to take the plunge, I\nstrongly recommend it. Otherwise,\nif you are unwilling to spend,\nbut still want your audio quality,\nstick to your current earphones.\nOne of the least used feature,\nalbeit equally important, is the\nability to transfer data to and from\nyour phone. These can include files,\nor even stuff like contacts. Android\nphones fare the best in this category,\narguably. Once you connect your\nphone to the mobile data network,\nor a WiFi network and sign in to your\nGoogle account, your contact details\nwill automatically get synchronised\nto your phone. iOS users have iCloud\nand Windows Phone users will have\nMicrosoft\u2019s services. To transfer files,\nyou can use cloud storage services\nlike Dropbox, OneDrive (formely\nknown as SkyDrive) or Google\nDrive. Android users have the\noption of using apps like AirDroid\nto transfer files on an ad-hoc basis.\nThere are, however, some things\nthat still need wires. They are\nhowever, arguably specialised.\nFor example, if you want to use\nyour phone as a remote control\nfor your DSLR camera, you still\nneed the USB on the go (OTG)\ncable. If you want to connect your\nphone to the TV, you still need\nMaximilian Eggl\u2019s first thoughts on Facebook\u2019s new app\nY\nes, Facebook, has\nturned 10. Ten years\nthis giant has been\nsucking out our souls,\nkilling our times and\ngenerally trying to inject itself into\nevery aspect of our lives. Now they\nhave introduced their next strategy\nin their multi-pronged attack to make\nthemselves virtually indispensible,\na reader app named paper. Almost\nidentical to Flipboard, it aims to\ndeliver a new experience to browsing\nFacebook, and general news around\nthe Internet.\nThe quote I first read when I\nread about Paper was \u201cThis would\nbe Facebook if it had been first\ncreated in 2014\u201d. I cannot agree\nmore. Doing away with the blue and\nsomewhat out-dated style of the\nwebsite and application, it replaces\neverything with individuals little\nstories on the bottom with one\nrandomly selected story filling up\nthe background. Furthermore this\nformat is replicated throughout\nthe entire app, e.g. Headlines,\nNews etc. All in all everything\nlooks really futuristic and smooth.\nIn terms of actual Facebook use,\nit tends to everything quite well.\nMessages and notifications are\nalmost the same (although the\ndouble notification of both the\nnormal Facebook app and then paper\ndid annoy me to the point that I did\nhave to turn it off). You can post\nstatuses, like and comment things\netc. Furthermore the Facebook\nprofiles just look really great.\nThis app was billed as the death of\nthe old Facebook app and looking at it\nI can understand why the bloggers of\nthe Internet predict this. However for\nnow I just believe it is too different,\nfeels like it is lacking to many features\nto be a real killer. It does show that\nFacebook is ready to change things\nup and stay current, also it is a good\nalternative when you are too tired\nof seeing blue all the time though.\nThe News Bubble\nMaximilian Eggl\nYong Wen Chua\nOsama Awara\nTechnology Editors\nFacebook has turned 10. However instead of celebrating any sort of\nachievemnt, the internet is awash with studies and blogs that seem\nto purport the end of the mighty social media site. However the tech\nteam at Felix do believe that, while facebook has lost a lot of its \u201ccool\u201d\nfactor, the end of FB is still a long way off. By the way, if you want to\nsee something quite nifty, have a look at Facebook.com/lookback.\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date\nwith the newest, wierdest and most futuristic things around\nFacebook turns 10\nAfter a month of speculation the new CEO of one of the biggest tech\ncompanies at the moment has been revealed. Satya Nadella, who\nwas previously in charge of the cloud computing division of MS, will\nnow take the helm, at what is seen as a crucial time for the company.\nFurthermore Bill Gates, the founder of MS, has stepped down as\nchairman instead taking the role of \u201ctechnival advisor\u201d, perhaps\nsignifying a more hands-on approach to steering his company.\nthe HDMI. Wireless bandwidth\nis just not fast enough for this yet.\nI can pretty much live without\nconnecting my phone to any wire\nmost of the time. As I mentioned,\nyou still need wires for some\nthings, but the list is diminishing\nas wireless bandwidth improves.\nTired of all those Wires?\nYong Wen Chua gives you some tips to avoid those pesky things\nNew Microsoft CEO\n\n"

Gide, in light of this, uses\nMichel\u2019s resurgent passions, desires and\nwhims as a central motif to convey subtle\n(but firmly present) Nietzschean postula-tions. Michel reneges on his obligations\nto his wife, to his profession and to social\nstanding, searching for more base pas-sion, for an affinity with nature free from\nthe shackles of culture. As identified by\nAlan Sheridan of Cambridge University,\n\u201cMichel...has adopted Nietzsche\u2019s view\nthat morality is a weapon of the weak, a\nslave mentality.\u201d\nIn the words of the protagonist , \u201cCulture, which is born of life, ends up killing\nit.\u201d This theme is embellished by Gide\u2019s\nimplementation of the first person nar-rative.

Imperial\nCollege's \u00a379.1m million endowment fund is the UK's 10th largest, and \u00a34,356,285 of this is\ndirectly being invested in oil, coal and gas. Imperial has no ethical investment policy.\nWe call on Imperial to:\n1) Immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies.\n2) Divest from current directly owned shares and any co-mingled funds that invest in fossil\nfuel companies within 5 years.\nImperial College is currently ranked 113th in People & Planet's Green League, reflecting\na lack of commitment to environmental issues. Imperial is a world-leading institution in\nenvironmental and climate change research, and we feel the college fund should reflect this\nand not be investing in resources that are the root cause of climate change.\nWhy is this important?\nClimate change has been described as the most serious challenge of our generation. Under\nthe United Nations Copenhagen Accord, countries have agreed to limit warming to 2 degrees\nto prevent dangerous climate change.\nClimate change has been described as the most serious challenge of our generation. Under\nthe United Nations Copenhagen Accord, countries have agreed to limit warming to 2 degrees\nto prevent dangerous climate change. Moreover, investing in fossil fuels poses a serious\nfinancial risk. According to recent research led by Professor Lord Stern at LSE, two-thirds\nof current fossil fuels reserves are unburnable if climate change is to be kept to the globally-agreed limit of 2 degrees of warming.\nIn this regard, we call upon the new president of Imperial College London to set a new\nprecedent by working with the Endowment Fund Board to issue explicit guidance to ensure\nfunds are divested away from fossil fuels.\nSigned by 126 signatories made up of staff, students, and university alumni.

In living memory, people would\nturn up to work to find a pile of rubble where their shop once stood. Defiantly, they grabbed a broom and\ngot sweeping.\nWe didn\u2019t let the National Socialists get to us. We shouldn\u2019t let millionaire socialist Bob Crow either.\n\u201d\n- Discussion about the tube strikes, Felix Facebook\nOf Cleaning (again), cat\nallergies and weather\nFelix\nS\noooo, Imperial\u2019s reseach\non cat immunotherapy\nlead to the creation\nof a startup and more\nrecently an IPO worth\n\u00a3175m during an upcoming stock\nmarket float (see page 3)?\nKeep the Cat Free!\nAfter the state of this week\u2019s\nweather, aside from investing in\na conspicuously branding free\numbrella at the Union shop, we\nfeel that and cat related sicknesses\nor allergies are of a high priority!\nAfter successive articles about the\nCampus Services\u2019 poor handling\nof the cleaning provisions this year,\nFelix is fairly impressed to see that\nnew information has been provided\nto students. While there is some\nargument that the new cleaning\nbooklet and detailed cleaning rota\nshould have always been in place,\nlet alone at the start of term, it is\nrefreshing to see some meaningful\naction from the department, even\nif it took over four months to get to\nthe stage of releasing a booklet (for\nmore see pg. 4).\nIgnoring the fairly woeful volume\nof vacuum cleaners distributed\namongst the student population\nin halls, at least they can now buy\ncleaning bundles from Essentials.\nFinally, Monday see\u2019s the opening\nof nominations for next year\u2019s\nSabbatical Team, along with many\nother important positions such\nas Departmental Representatives\n(the people who can get your\ndepartment to improve your\ncourse), student trustees (students\nwho are voted to sit on the Union\u2019s\nhighest democratic board, and\nmuch, much more.\nYou\u2019d better start running!\n\n"

    "content": "32 FRIDAY 07 FEB\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJohn Park Television Editor\nThe horror...the horro\nAmerican Horror Story is an anthology series that is without doubt the\nbest thing that has come out of Ryan\nMurphy\u2019s head. Eat Pray Love? An\nannoyingly self-centred, deluded travelogue starring Julia Roberts that induces vomit, but not in the amount of\ngigantic volumes that Glee induces instead with their weekly nauseating ep-isodes. Nip/Tuck was all right though,\nand even the recently cancelled The\nNew Normal had some comedy po-tential. But right at this moment it\u2019s all\nabout American Horror Story, that\u2019s\nalready given us three seasons, with\na fourth one commissioned and Murphy hinting that he\u2019s got an amazing\nidea for season 5. Each season being\na self-contained one helps bring out\nthe originality of every \u201creboot\u201d series,\nalthough AHS also prides itself in recycling a large portion of its talented\ncast members in different roles showing off their award-worthy versatility.\nAmerican Horror\nStory: Murder\nHouse\nIt all begins with Murder House, in\nwhich a family on the rocks moves\ninto a mansion that is bought at a ridiculously cheap price, which therefore means it\u2019s very haunted. Psychiatrist Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott)\nwas caught cheating on his wife Vivien\n(Connie Britton) and this new house\nmarks a fresh start, not that the married couple and their daughter Violet\n(Taissa \u201csister of Vera\u201d Farmiga) are\nin for any of that; turns out the house\nwas a home for many twisted individuals and a fair share of serial killers\nback in the day, with their evil spirits\nwandering the corridors and stair-cases. Their housekeeper Moira (in a\ncreepy double-act of Frances Conroy\nand Alexandra Breckenridge), who the\nfamily didn\u2019t want in the first place but\nwas reluctantly accepted in as a part of\na package deal, seems to know more\nthan she\u2019s letting on, and she also has\nsome deep-buried history with the\nneighbour, Constance (Jessica Lange).\nNow this Constance is quite a character and is played so superbly and deliciously mysteriously by the Golden\nGlobe, SAG, Emmy-winning Lange.\nShe wanders in and out of the Harmon\u2019s as though she owns the place,\nlights a cigarette, says twisted things\nlike \u201cdon\u2019t make me kill you again\u201d to\npoor old Moira and talks about how\nher womb is cursed, plus she seems\nto know and be connected to a lot of\nthe things that\u2019s wrong with the house\nin question. Her daughter Addie\n(Jamie Brewer) who has Down\u2019s Syndrome is also in contact with the spirit\nworld which adds more intrigue and\nsuspense with countless WTF moments involving this mother-daughter\npairing.\nThe rich, blood-soaked history\nwhich the house is drenched in is revealed with every episode. We have\nan illegal abortion practitioner in the\n1920s (Charles Montgomery) who\ngoes crazy and starts placing organs in\njars after his pushy wife (Lily Rabe, ex-cellent) basically drives him nuts with\nher endless complaining and emascu-lation, the Black Dahlia killing of 1947\n(Joshua Malina, killing Mena Suvari)\nalso happens here, nursing students\nare murdered in 1968, a kinky gay\ncouple, the previous owners before\nthe Harmons, (Zachary Quinto and\nTeddy Sears) with fidelity issues meet\na horrendously gruesome end, and so\non. The decades of history call for a lot\nof flashback sequences that are tightly\nstructured and wonderfully designed.\nEach fascinating guest spot is filled\nwith talented actors who make their\nrelatively shorter contributions count.\nBut what of the central characters?\nThey are all played to the highest of\nstandards, with Britton standing out\nas a woman trying to hold it together\nalthough she\u2019s really starting to lose it,\nand Farmiga emerging as a breakout\nstar, along with Evan Peters. Peters is\nTate, one of Ben\u2019s patients, who starts\nshowing some interest in Violet, much\nto Dr Ben\u2019s worry. And what\u2019s with\nthe horribly disfigured Larry Harvey\n(Denis O\u2019Hare) stalking Dr Ben? He\nwants to warn Ben about the house,\nalthough his intentions, like most individuals mentioned here so far, aren\u2019t\nthe clearest.\nAs can be expected, there is plenty\nof violence, sex and shock factor; Britton enjoying a nice plate of freshly prepared pig brain is no doubt one of the\nseason\u2019s most unforgettable moments.\nThe reason that AHS: Murder House\nworks so well is not solely dependent\non how many creepy ideas that can\ncome out of the writers in each epi-sode, but in how they actually impact\nthese complicated characters\u2019 stories.\nBelieve it or not, there is even a\nsurprising number of heart-tugging\nscenes that mark the season\u2019s best high\npoints. The relationship that eventually blossoms between the trouble Violet and Tate, who is equally disturbed,\nfeels like a sweet, genuine romance,\nConstance and Addie have their share\nof touching moments, and the family dynamic of the Harmons, mostly\nstemming from Ben and Vivien, is\nthe glue that keeps the show together.\nWith pitch-perfect performances all-round, a fine balance between shock-horror and well-paced storytelling,\nthe first season not only shows promise for the future, but also wraps up to\nbecome an easily rewatchable, highly\nentertaining stand-alone season.\nAmerican Horror\nStory: Asylum\nThings get even more violent and uncomfortable with the second season\nAsylum. As its name suggests, the\ncharacters here revolve around a hos-pital/prison for the criminally insane\nwhere madness and chaos reign. Starting with a sequence in which guest\nstar Adam Levine\u2019s arm gets ripped\noff, Asylum is poised to become the\nbest of the bunch and indeed it does.\nRuled by the sadistic Sister Jude\nMartin (Jessica Lange, perfect as ever,\nhere sporting a thick harsh Boston ac-cent) who is a firm believer in punishment in the form of electroconvulsive\ntherapy (ECT) as well as some good\nold-fashioned caning, the Briarcliff\nMental Institution looks like the last\nplace any sane person would like to\nend up in. Which is why when reporter Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson), hoping to expose the institution\u2019s cruelty\nand mistreatment towards its inmates,\nenters and becomes trapped, we start\nworrying.\nJudged and hissed at by Jude for being a lesbian, Lana is desperate not\nonly for a story now, but now for her\nfreedom too. Here she befriends Kit\nWalker (Evan Peters), another patient who seems to have been wrongly\nlocked up. The staff here consists of\nMonsignor Timothy Howard (Joseph\nFiennes), a well-meaning priest who\nnonetheless walks into the dark side,\nSister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe), a na\u00efve junior nun who has a bigger role\nto play as the season progresses, Dr\nOliver Thredson (Zachary Quinto), a\npsychiatrist tasked with treating the\n\n"

The\nnew course was created due to high\ndemand from around the world.\nAn online learning platform called\nThe Hub has been created by the\nBusiness school to host the new\nprogramme. Students can use The\nHub to interact with each other and\ntheir tutors during lectures and via\nforums.\nThe Dean of Imperial Business\nschool, Professor Anandalingham\nsaid:\n\u201cOnline learning has experienced a\nreal surge in popularity over the last\nfew years. This is because significant\nadvancements in technology have\nallowed people to effectively learn\nand study without having to set foot\nin the lecture theatre.

However, the\nbuilding was tested overnight by EDF\nwho determined that the scare was a\nfalse alarm.\nA spokesperson for Imperial College\nLondon said: \u201c\u201dImperial received\nreports of a drop in pressure in the\nnatural gas lines accompanied by a\nsmell of gas in the Chemistry Building\nat approximately 18.00 yesterday.\nAs a precaution, the building was\nevacuated and the gas supply shut\noff.

The engineers found no\ntrace of gas escaping from anywhere\nin the building.\nHaving established its safety, the\nbuilding reopened as normal this\nmorning.\u201d\nChemistry students were warned\n\u201cto be extra careful when using\nmercaptans or thiols, which can often\nlead to the gassy smells.\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNews Editor\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNews Editor\nGraduating\nstudents leave\nthousands of\npounds on\nprint service\nA\nfreedom of information\nrequest to Imperial\nCollege has revealed\nthat undergraduate and\ntaught postgraduate\nstudents graduating from Imperial\nCollege left over \u00a313,465.09 of unused\nprinter credit on the College\u2019s system\nat the end of the 2012/2013 academic\nyear.

I\u2019ve been sleeping with my friend,\nand it\u2019s been working as an excellent\nmethod of stress release for months. But\nwith all the pre-Valentine\u2019s excitement\ngoing around at the moment, I\u2019ve\nstarted to think about him differently, I\nthink I want more. How can I convince\nhim to give it a go?\nNervous in Knightsbridge\nWhen friends end up sleeping together\non the reg, the heady combination of\nfriendship and oxytocin is quite likely\nto make often-unwanted feelings\nform. When developed in this way,\nthis affects different people at different\nrates, which makes it unlikely that\nthese feelings will be reciprocated.\nAlthough you\u2019ll lose your convenient\nstress release, you shouldn\u2019t sleep\nwith him if you\u2019re not sure that you\u2019re\non the same page, as it\u2019ll just end up\nmessy for everyone.\nHelp! I went out with a guy, and we had\na great time (ifyouknowhatimean).\nNow he\u2019s asked me out again, but he\u2019s\nmore keen than I am, and I don\u2019t know\nwhether I\u2019d be leading him on if I go out\nwith him again, what should I do?\nLeading on in Leicester Square\nIf you enjoyed seeing him last time,\nand you obviously did, you\u2019ll probably\nhave fun again. Yes, he might be\nmore keen than you, but it is only a\nsecond date, you\u2019re not committing to\nanything. You should give it another\ngo, and if you\u2019re still not sure if you\nlike him enough afterwards, you can\nalways let him down gently afterwards.\nHelp! I\u2019m addicted to Tinder! I can\u2019t\nstop mentally swiping left and right to\neveryone that I pass on the street, I\u2019ve\nused up all my mobile data, and my\nphone battery is always critically low.\nI want to break this habit but I don\u2019t\nknow how, what do I do?\nJudgemental on the Jubilee Line\nIf you have Tinder, you\u2019ll have\nnoticed that everyone is on Tinder.\nThe mental judgement of people is\ntherefore validated, but the personal\ninconvenience is problematic. Try and\nwean yourself off constant use, limit\nyourself to only checking at certain\ntimes of the day. If you\u2019re particularly\nworried about what will happen if\nyou don\u2019t immediately respond to\nyour messages, you\u2019ve got far bigger\nproblems than an app addiction.\nHelp! My housemate has just confessed\nto having feelings for me, and now it\u2019s\nreally awkward. Should I give it a go,\nor is a housemate too risky?\nApprehensive in Angel\nGetting together with a housemate\nis very risky. If it works out and you\nend up together, you\u2019re immediately\nthrown into the very serious situation\nof living together straight away, which\nis very intense. If it doesn\u2019t work out,\nyou\u2019ll end up being jealous every time\nthey mention a romantic interest, or\nyou\u2019ll never quite bounce back from\nthe awkwardness. If it\u2019s meant to be,\nit\u2019ll happen once you no longer live\ntogether, so I\u2019d leave it alone for now.\nHelp! I recently broke up with my\nboyfriend of five years, and we\u2019ve been\ntrying to stay friends, but he keeps\ntelling me about other girls that he\u2019s\nseeing now. I don\u2019t want to know, but\nI don\u2019t know how to make him stop\nwithout making it look like I\u2019m jealous.\nAny advice?\nHeartbroken in Hampstead\nHe sounds like he\u2019s over exaggerating\nhis romantic and sexual conquests to\nyou in order to gain a reaction. This\ncould be because he\u2019s desperate to\nmake you think that he\u2019s over it, either\nbecause he hasn\u2019t moved on yet, or\nbecause he thinks that you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s\nokay to not want to know, he\u2019s been a\nhuge part of your life, and it\u2019s natural\nthat your feelings would still be raw.\nJust explain to him that while you are\nfriends now, you still have to have\nboundaries in what you can discuss\nwhile you adapt to life without each\nother.\n1. It will come back to bite you\nThere are many consequences to getting a bit inappropriate\nwith someone in your tutorial group, seminar, or kitchen in\nhalls. These consequences range from the sweet (you may\nend up with an overly-clingy admirer that you just can\u2019t\nshake) to the sinister (that person who you decided was no\nlonger worth being with might channel their jealousy into\nmaking your life a misery). Of course, these are things that\ncan happen in any situation, but the intensity of emotion is\namplified by the frequency of the interaction.\n2. Everyone will know\nWhen you become involved with someone you work with,\nor spend a lot of time with, you sacrifice the intimacy\nand confidentiality usually encoded in a relationship, be\nit sexual or romantic. Details of your relationship will be\nopen for public discussion, and you have to be prepared to\nbear this consequence.\n3. It changes things\nAssume that it works out well (at least for a while). You\nwill be sorely mistaken if you think that this isn\u2019t going\nto change the way that you do things together, and not\nnecessarily for the better. If you work together, you might\nmake biased decisions towards each other\u2019s idea. If you live\ntogether, you might be more inclined to gang up on others\nyou live with, even if it\u2019s just over doing the washing up.\nThis isn\u2019t fair on the other people involved, and might be\nsomething you live to regret in the long run.\n4. It never ends well\nThere\u2019s no scenario in which it\u2019s going to be easy to end\na relationship with someone you will continue to see\nregularly. Whether you end on good terms or you fall\nout horribly, the situation will be tense and unpleasant at\nfirst, and not just for you, for everyone around you as well.\nEveryone you both interact with is inevitably a part of your\nrelationship, and will pick up on the vibe that the two of\nyou are emitting, and that\u2019s never fun.\nAnnie\u2019s advice that\nImperial sorely needs\nWhy you shouldn\u2019t shit where\nyou eat (Just leave it, yeah?)\nSend Annie your problems and suggestions at catnip.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA\ngony Aunt Annie\nWhiteley is the\nwoman who\nfought for women\u2019s\ncloakroom facilities\nat Imperial, and thus is qualified\nto solve all your problems.\nWhat\nimportant\nadvice\nshould\nAnnie\ndish out\nnext\nweek?\nEmail\nany ideas\nto the\naddress\nbelow!\nF\nelix fanatic looking for\nlike-minded lover to spend\nWednesday afternoons in\nthe west basement together.\nWLTM writer with GSOH,\npreferably who edits Hangman but\ncould edit science, news or sport\n(just not fashion or travel).

    "content": "33\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 07 FEB\nTELEVISION\nor...horror has a face\npatients at Briarcliff, and mad scientist\nDr Arthur Arden (James Cromwell)\nwho is up to no good whatsoever.\nOnce again, the performances here\nare first-class. We welcome back many\nfamiliar faces, and those with expanded roles compared to what they had in\nMurder House in particular shine. Lily\nRabe further proves her worth in the\nanthology as she goes through some\npretty drastic changes and embodies\nthem brilliantly and Zachary Quinto\ntakes charge of his sinister subplot\nwith effective stares and a suitably\ncreepy tone of voice. But it\u2019s Sarah\nPaulson, who only appeared in a frus-tratingly limited capacity the year be-fore, takes centre stage and becomes\nthe feminist heroine to root for. The\nstrength she displays throughout the\nseason is extraordinary and boy is she\ngiven a lot to deal with. But with all\nthe difficulties she faces, she becomes\nmore resourceful, independent and\nstronger than ever.\nSo what themes are waiting for its\naudience in Asylum? Given that the\nplace is run by strict Catholic beliefs,\nideas of God and Satan are keenly ex-plored, everyone has dark demons to\nbattle, especially Jude, with a juicy past\nto address herself, the aftermath of the\nSecond World War is featured, we get\nzombies, aliens (oh yes), dodgy scientific experiments, a musical scene (re-ally), and a gramophone with the song\n\u2018Dominique\u2019, a popular French song\nrecorded by Jeanine Decker aka \u201cThe\nSinging Nun\u201d, on endless repeat. That\nsong alone will drive you insane. All\nin all it\u2019s a jam-packed season of mad\ngoods.\nLet\u2019s not forget about the central\nlove story that also takes place. Kit\nWalker, in his attempts to break free,\ncatches the attention of another pa-tient, Grace Bertrand (Lizzie Brocher\u00e9), and together they attempt to\nsurvive the wrath of Sister Jude, the\nconniving, twisted mind of Dr Arden\nas they look for ways to get the hell\nout of Briarcliff. What Peters and Brocher\u00e9 share here is different to Peters\nand Farmiga portray in Murder House;\nthis time the characters are older, the\nstakes are higher, and the possibility of\nfailure more evident.\nThe design of the institution itself\ncouldn\u2019t be more depressing. It\u2019s a\ndamp, dark, metal-barred collection of\nholding cells, with dimly lit corridors\nlooked at from weird camera angles\n(the anthology loves doing these, upside down shots, side angles, blurred\nshots etc). It\u2019s an unpleasant place of\nresidence to say the least, but with\nevery episode, it succeeds in drawing\nyou in with its forever-evolving dark\nsubplots. Because when else do you\nsee the excellent Ian McShane play a\npsychopathic serial killer dressed as\nSanta Claus?\nAfter a 13-episode stint you may\nwell need some therapy of your own,\ntrying to get all the horrific images out\nof your head \u2013 which is what makes\nthis season such a unique rollercoaster ride of head-spinning ideas, full-on\nshock factor developments and most\nof all, powerful performances.\nAmerican Horror\nStory: Coven\nNow the third season marks the biggest step down and disappointment\nin the anthology. The set-up was bril-liant; the cast assembled? Perfection.\nAnd this season had the best promotional clips of the series thus far. A live\nsnake being passed from one mouth\nto another? Yes please. A human stuck\nwith dozens of voodoo needles? Score!\nFloating witches? Come at me. But the\n13-episode arc felt over-stuffed in the\nend, as Coven lacked consistency, fun\nand well-drawn characters.\nIt starts off promisingly enough. Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange, all dressed\nup in black) is a powerful witch, the\nreigning Supreme of witches who is\nrapidly nearing death thanks to her\ncancer diagnosis. And so begins the\nseason-long search for the next Supreme. Is it Zoe (welcomes back Taissa Farmiga) who has the unfortunate\npower to kill with sexual intercourse?\nIs it Madison (Emma \u201cniece of Julia\u201d\nRoberts), the bitchy Hollywood ac-tress? Is it Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe)\nthe human voodoo doll who can inflict\npain on others through self-harm? Is\nit Nan (welcome back Jamie Brewer)\nwho has the speical gift of telepathy?\nHow about Misty (Lily Rabe, her\nthird appearance in the anthology),\nthe swamp witch who can resurrect\nthe dead, be it humans or animals?\nIs Myrtle (woohoo Frances Conroy is\nalso back!), Fiona\u2019s nemesis also in the\nrunning or is she too old for this? We\nalso can\u2019t ignore Cordelia (Sarah Paulson \u2013 YES!), Fiona\u2019s daughter, either,\nas she acts as a carer for all the young\nwitches looking for a home and protection at Miss Robichaux\u2019s Academy\nfor Exceptional Young Ladies.\nBesides the plot of everyone trying\nto figure out who the next Supreme\nis and Fiona trying to kill her in order\nto gain her fading powers back, the\nwitches\u2019 coven also has other things\nto worry about. The unsteady alliance\nbetween witches and voodoo practitioners led by Marie Laveau (Angela\nBassett) is starting to show its cracks,\nand we\u2019re also introduced to witch\nhunters who, as their name suggests,\nhunt down witches for a living with\ntheir silver bullets.\nAll this begs for some slick sequences of action. \u201cThe only thing you have\nto be afraid of is me\u201d says Fiona after\nshe throws the misbehaving young\nwitches against the wall with her telekinetic powers. But what ensues is\ndisappointingly tame and the powerful witches with supposed powers are\nnever given the chance to properly\nshow them off. If you\u2019re looking for a\nmassive showdown between a group\nof witches and everyone else out to get\nthem, you\u2019re in the wrong place. Internal politics and bickering between\nwitches take over and soon these powerful women are in the midst of a dull,\nnever-ending catfight.\nSure Marie Laveau raises some\nzombies from the dead and attack the\ncoven, but that\u2019s just over one episode.\nThe aforementioned witch hunters?\nThey are dispatched by a character\nwho is not even a witch which adds to\nthe long list of how badly a lot of the\nplot points are handled and quickly\nwritten off throughout the season.\nAlso problematic is the character\nof Madame Marie Delphine LaLurie\n(Kathy Bates), a much-anticipated\nsupporting player who Murphy promised would be five times worse than\nBates\u2019 character in Misery. Based on\nthe real-life socialite, LaLurie imprisoned and tortured her black slaves in\nthe early 1830s, something that is given some screen time here, contributing to the \u201chorror\u201d aspect of the show.\nSure Bates is a racist, sadist who literally puts blood on her hands to smear\nall over her face but once you get past\nthe horrendous nature of this charac-ter, you begin to wonder just how she\nfits in to the overall story. In the end,\nshe doesn\u2019t and she too, is tossed aside\nlike something that never happened.\nAnd why was Patti LuPone even\ngiven the guest-starring spot on the\nshow? She and newcomer Alexander\nDreymon play mother and son who\nmove in next door to the coven. After\na brief hint of potential romance between the boy and one of the witches,\nthey too, are dispatched elsewhere,\nserving merely as an unwelcome distraction from the main plot that really\nmatters.\nThings start to pick up eventually in\nthe penultimate episode (there are 13\nhere \u2013 the middle part is the major let-down), when the action gets going and\nthe plot starts moving forward instead\nof meandering in pointless, inconsequential subjects no one ends up caring about.\nThe wonderful performances are\nstill there, even the newcomers to the\nanthology Bassett and Bates, who will\nreportedly be sticking around for future seasons, are a welcome addition\nto the cast, with Lange prepared to\nleave after season 4. But please, let\u2019s\nmark Coven as just a one-off mishap\nthat will never ever happen again.\n\n"

I\nhave been there. I have experienced\nthe peaks and troughs (or more\nlikely deep underwater trenches) of\nundergrad life.\nWith the MScs, however, it is\ndifferent. They make more exotic and\nhard to find GTA work than 3rd year\nundergrads. Their courses are an awful\nlot smaller (lowering their sighting\nchances) and they are only taught by\ncertain departments (lowering the\nhabitats).\nDue to their rarity they also hang\naround in one big group and when\nthreatened by countless undergrads\ngenerally stake out some sort of\nback room not many people know\nabout and claim it as theirs. As my\nsupervisor is not really involved with\nthem, I had assumed that was that for\nme, but somehow early this term I\ntalked my way into one.\nI was not really sure what to expect,\nbut prepped the notes as usual, on the,\num\u2026 night before. When I walked\ninto the room something immediately\nhit me: lack of smell. To be fair to the\nundergrads some of the ventilation in\nthe lecture halls is really terrible, but\nto be honest after they have been in a\nconfined space for an hour or two, it\nis not always the nicest place to enter.\nAlso the MSc faces looking back at\nme were kind of old. Not gnarly or\nanything, but older definitely than me\nwhich was off putting especially know\nI was trying to help people who had\nmuch, much more experience than\nme.\nBefore long I had my first question,\nwhere a pair of students (who had\nchecked with each other first, which\nwas weird) did not understand the\nquestion.

    "content": "16 FRIDAY 07 FEB\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSOUND IT OUT \u00a9 V&A\nEamonn Postlethwaite\nWriter\nT\nhe Friday Lates are, much as\nthe name suggests, a series\nof exhibitions that take place\non a Friday night, specifically\nthe last Friday of each\nmonth. The content is purposefully\nchosen to be very different from what\none might expect to be displayed in\nthe V&A \u2013 this most recent Friday\nLate, on the 31st of January, was\ncurated by Boiler Room, a somewhat\nhard to describe entity.\nBoiler Room, the brainchild of\nBlaise Bellville, started life as a\nguest-list only club night in Dalston\nthat showcased the best of London\u2019s\nunderground electronic music scene\nby streaming a live TV feed online\nfor every performance. It grew\nin importance and repute until it\nbecame the big name in the scene,\nand now has offices in New York,\nBerlin and Los Angeles. Importantly,\nit has branched out from streaming\nperformances, and now takes part\nin all kinds of cultural music based\nforums, including Friday Late.\nThefirstthingInoticeduponwalking\ninto the V&A from the Exhibition\nRoad entrance was how surreal it was\nto be surrounded by beautiful marble\nsculptures of nymphs and classical\nera gods and goddesses, while having\nmy ears bombarded with sounds\nvery much on the experimental edge\nof London\u2019s electronic music scene.\nThe theme of the evening can very\nloosely be summed up as \u201cexploring\nthe relationships between spaces,\ntechnology and sound\u201d, and the\nfirst exhibit I saw was the Bristol\ncollective Emptyset\u2019s piece, Medium.\nSet outside in the John Madejski\nGarden, and displayed on a large\nLED screen with several speakers,\nthe piece used semi-static images of\nthe gothic Woodchester Mansion and\nharsh static to change the area into a\ngrim and foreboding place, in sharp\ncontrast to the brightly lit, opulent\nand warm museum interior.\nNext I came to the grand entrance\nwhere the boiler room set itself was\nunderway, and after a short dance,\n(making sure to get myself in the\nway of the cameras filming for the\nonline stream) I made my way to the\nnearby Medieval and Renaissance\nRoom where electronic musicians\nBill Kouligas and Mat Dryhurst,\njoined in their conviction that live\nstreaming will become its own\nexpressive medium, were performing\nlive manipulation of the boiler room\naudio. Most interesting about this\nexhibit was how organic it was; the\ndistance from the boiler room was\nsmall enough such that you could\nstill just about hear the original,\nwhile listening to the abstract mix\nproduced unrehearsed by the two\nmusicians. They were chatting to each\nother, dancing to their own modified\nbeats and talking to and encouraging\nmembers of the audience to \u201cget\ntheir funk on\u201d. It was unpretentious\nfun, created by two people with real\ninterest in what they were doing.\nJourneying now to the highest\nlevel of the V&A, and into the very\ncomfortableLydiaandManfredGorvy\nlecture theatre, my favourite exhibit\nof the night, called London Modular,\nwere creating the kind of noises\nthat make you make that face. Four\nenormous modular synths were being\nprogrammed live to create some truly\nbeautiful music, while informative\nslides were on loop via projector.\nThe best part came when they used\nanalogue synthesis to produce\nchaotic noise via a series of non-linear\ndynamical equations, and then used\ndigital logic gates to decide which\nnoise to filter. They dealt with the\ninfinitesimal point at which a system\nchanges from deterministic to truly\nchaotic, which, as a mathematician,\nI found particularly interesting. After\nthe performance we were encouraged\nto go and poke around with the synths\nand ask any questions we may have,\nand the enthusiasm of all involved\nwas truly heart-warming.\nThere was so many exhibits I didn\u2019t\nhave chance to see on the night, but\nthe sheer inventiveness and variety\nof those that I did, along with the \u00a30\nentry fee, means I would recommend\nnext month\u2019s Friday Late to anyone,\nregardless of its subject matter.\nV&A\u2019s Boiler Room\nUnder The Vaults\nFred Fyles goes underground as part of\nthe Waterloo Vaults Festival\nW\nhen I take my\nseat in the\nslightly cramped,\nu n d e r g r o u n d\ntheatre that\nmakes up one of the venues of the\nVault Festival, I am not just sitting\nin a room 10 metres below Waterloo\nStation; I am instead inhabiting the\nspace between \u2018sanity and death\u2019.\nAt least, this is what we are told by\nMichelle Roche, whose monologue\n\u2018I Grew Up In An Old Person\u2019s Home\u2019\ndetails what her life was like as a young\nperson whose parents converted\ntheir house into a care home for the\nelderly. Over the course of 45 minutes\nwe find out all about the adventures,\nincidents, and personal tragedies that\nwent on under that roof.\nRoche, who appears alone on\nthe stage, bar the company of\nfour precariously strung teacups,\ncuts an instantly likeable figure.\nJoyful and expressive, she bounces\nacross the stage, acting out various\ncharacters from her childhood; we\nare introduced to the elderly Scottish\ngentleman who bellows folk songs\nat the top of his lungs, and Tiger,\nthe former mountain climber who is\nnow confined to her bed, fed a series\nof mashed up meals. Roche looks\nback at the world with rose-tinted\nspectacles, reminiscing that she\nnever experienced any tragedy, never\nnoticed when one of the residents\nhad died; and yet, the production\nis tinged with a current of regret\nand pathos that runs to its core.\nNearly all the residents of the home\nhad Alzheimer\u2019s, that most horrific\nof disorders that robs a person of\ntheir memories and reasoning, and\nin one of the play\u2019s most startling\nscenes Roche acts out a conversation\nbetween an elderly woman and her\nvisiting son, whom she no longer\nrecognises. Flitting from character to\ncharacter, Roche transitions between\nstates of excitement, hope, and\ndepression at the drop of a hat.\nHowever, while the acting may be\ngreat, the play somewhat falters on\nits scripting, which has a tendency to\nlack pace, giving the play a somewhat\nsluggish feel. Emphasising the warped\nexperiences of dementia patients,\nwho have lost the ability to perceive\nreality, and the repetitious nature\nof caring for them, Roche repeats\ncertain scenes and conversations\nmultiple times. Sometimes they are\nat different speeds, but mostly they\nare delivered with exactly the same\ntone and intonation. While this\nmight have not been a problem in\na production with multiple actors,\nor in a longer piece, in the context\nof this performance they somewhat\ngrate, creating a jarring experience.\nBut then again, this could have\nbeen the intention of Roche all along;\nnevertheless, the most impressive\nparts of the monologue come when\nRoche is whipped up into a childlike\nfrenzy, describing her life with\naplomb.\nIt can be difficult to convincingly\ndescribe what life is like for the\nelderly in our society, who are often\ndenied a voice, or \u2013 in the case of\nAlzheimer\u2019s \u2013 not really able to speak\nfor themselves. Roche\u2019s expressive\nphrases seem to capture all the joy\nand despair that come with living in\nan old people\u2019s home; she talks about\nthe fun she used to have with the\nresidents, and in the next line delivers\ncutting remarks about their \u2018paperthin skin\u2019, that can only make you feel\na profound sense of pity.\nFor me, the most arresting moment\ncame when Roche describes what\nhappened when a childhood friend\ncame over to the house; she describes\nall that happened in a blur of words,\nbecoming more and more excited,\nand then, when she repeats the story\nmore slowly, it seems to dawn on her\nhow terrifying her friend would have\nfound the experience. This change\nfrom wonder to horror is a subtle\none that Roche manages to pull off\nwithout a hitch.\nAt the beginning of the production,\nwe are told that the wall behind us is\nthe \u2018sane world\u2019, where we have all of\nour memories, and we know what\u2019s\nwhat, while the back of the stage\nrepresents \u2018death\u2019. Roche invites us\ninto the twilight zone, between these\ntwo worlds, giving us a glimpse \u2013\nalbeit short \u2013 into life as an elderly\nperson; it is a difficult piece to pull\noff, but Roche manages to show us the\nworld of her childhood, one of cups\nof tea, snowstorms, and nostalgia.\nThe Vault Festival is a 6 week arts\nand entertainment festival with over\n60 events. It is running 28th January\n\u2013 8th March, under the tunnels at\nWaterloo station. Admission to the\nfestival is free but events are ticketed\nseperately, prices start at \u00a37.50.\nI Grew Up In An Old People\u2019s Home, a monologue by Michelle Roche\nMICHELLE ROCHE, VAULT FESTIVAL\n\n"

But, despite the inherent misgivings there, it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s actually\nkind of\u2026 fresh. So points for not being\npredictable, I guess.\nUnfortunately, That Awkward Moment can\u2019t help but squander those\npoints fairly quickly, as it turns out\nthat despite taking a new approach\nto rom-coms it still recycles the same\nold tropes, just from a different point\nof view. It\u2019s still the same old \u2018blah\nblah blah meant to be together oh no\nI messed it up let\u2019s try again anyway\nafter I win you back in nauseatingly\ncute fashion\u2019 and so on and so forth,\nbut with added dick jokes. Too many\ndick jokes, really, even if they are some\nof the funnier moments, a fact which\nprobably speaks volumes about either\nthe quality of the other jokes, or about\nmy tastes in comedy \u2013 I\u2019m going to\ngo with the former, mostly thanks to\nthe jokes being (on the whole) slightly\nweak (and partially because I\u2019m not\nadmitting faults here, I\u2019m not reviewing myself, am I. Am I?). This is very\nmuch a script that tries really hard to\nput a smile on your face and ham up\nthe \u2018comedy\u2019 aspect of \u2018rom-coms\u2019, but\non the whole it only really succeeds in\nputting a mild smirk.\nDespite this try-hard aspect, though,\nthere are certainly moments where a\nsmile is irresistible, and it\u2019s definitely\ncute enough without being schmaltzy,\nwhich is nice, and the banter between\nthe three main characters (Efron,\nTeller and Jordan \u2013 who all have great\ncharisma and chemistry with each\nother, if nothing else) is genuinely funny at times, including one stand-out\nscene towards the end. You can\u2019t help\nbut like the main characters \u2013 even if\nat least one of them (Efron) is roughly\n90% jerk \u2013 and the supporting cast\ngive their roles the best shot they can.\nThe main problem comes from the\nstoryline itself \u2013 Jordan\u2019s character is\ngoing through a divorce, so all three\nguys make a pact to stay single for as\nlong as they can, which is obviously\nless than 90 minutes seeing how this\nis a rom-com, but whatever \u2013 it\u2019s so\nby-the-numbers it\u2019s painful (and also\nworthy of some \u201ccolour-by-numbers\u201d\njoke but I have a suspicious feeling I\u2019ve\nused that one before), and when it\u2019s\nnot horribly contrived it\u2019s just downright dumb. And it commits the cardinal sin of using a voice-over at the\nstart and then completely ignoring\nit for basically the entire film. Minus\npoints for that one.\nOverall then, That Awkward Moment shares a trait with Last Vegas\nin that it has a semi-decent premise\nwith a completely useless storyline\nwhich ultimately proves to be shored\nup almost entirely by the charisma of\nits main actors. The direction is never\nless than acceptable, but never more\nthan mediocre, and the soundtrack\ntries too hard to force your hands\nemotionally, leaving a film that\u2019s un-derwhelmingly middle-of-the-road.\nHaving said that, of course \u2013 chuck an\nextra couple of points on if you\u2019re seeing it as a date movie. It\u2019s better with\nsomeone else.\nThe idea of the \u2018Teenager\u2019 \u2013 that\nglorious creature trapped between\nchildhood and adult life \u2013 is such an\nimmemorial concept in our cultural\nlandscape, it is difficult to imagine a\ntime when they did not exist. But that\nwas not always the case. It used to be\nthat the line between \u2018child\u2019 and \u2018adult\u2019\nwas set in stone: you stayed at home\nuntil you were old enough to work in\nthe factories, or be sent down a mine,\nand you then entered the adult world.\nTeenage, a patchwork of film, pic-tures, and mock Super-8 material by\nfilmmaker Matt Wolf, explores how\nthis phase of social and psychological\ndevelopment came about, forming an\nengaging and enlightening companion piece to writer Jon Savage\u2019s tome\n\u2018Teenage: The Creation of Youth\u2019.\nTaking the introduction of child labour laws as his starting point, Wolf\ncharts the journey of the adolescent\nover the first four decades of the 20th\nCentury, ending with Elliot E. Cohen\u2019s publication of \u2018A Teenage Bill of\nRights\u2019 in the New York Times in 1945.\nAlong the way we are introduced to\nthe landmarks of youth culture: the\nBright Young Things, the Jitterbugs,\neven the Hitler Youth. Wolf also looks\nat how the teenage demographic have\nbeen continuously exploited during\nthe last century. First they were mili-tarised, joining the Boy Scouts and\nbeing pushed into the trenches of the\nFirst World War; then they were de-monised by the press, with the actions\nof the Bright Young Things causing a\nscandal in 1920s London; and finally\nthey were recognised as a market\npower, and aggressively targeted by\nthe giants of consumerism \u2013 a trend\nthat continues to this day.\nThat is not to suggest that the film is\nall doom and gloom. On the whole it is\nuplifting, with Wolf repeatedly referring to the idea that youth culture was\n\u2018for the young, and led by the young\u2019,\nand the archive material we are presented is a real treat. Eschewing the\ntraditional single narrator favoured\nby documentary makers, Wolf instead\ngoes for a quartet of \u2018teenage\u2019 narrators \u2013 one of whom is played by Ben\nWhishaw \u2013 who describe what their\nlives were like growing up in the UK,\nUSA, and Germany during the early\n20th Century. This difference, along\nwith clever editing from the production team, gives the whole film a\nwoozy, almost dream-like feel, which\nis accentuated by the use of mock-ar-chival footage.\nWhile this faux-Super 8 footage\ngives the film a surreal quality, it\nmakes it difficult to tell which parts of\nthe film are actually real, undermining\nthe narrative structure. It also marks\nthe short end of the wedge of retro-fetishisation, which began with the ascent of \u2018kooky\u2019 Instagram filters, and\nnow represents a worryingly growing trend in the filmmaking industry.\nOne only has to look at last year\u2019s This\nAin\u2019t California to see how insidious\nthis spread has become; a so-called\ndocumentary about the East German\nskating scene of the 1980s, following\nits release it was revealed to be comprised mostly of staged footage, using\nactors. While Teenage doesn\u2019t quite go\nthis far, it treads a dangerous line between fantasy and reality that doesn\u2019t\ndo it any favours.\nTeenage is a light, somewhat frothy\npiece, that forms an excellent counterpoint to Savage\u2019s book, which offers a much more tangible insight into\nthe world of youth culture. The way\nthe film is assembled resembles the\nincredible work of British filmmaker\nAdam Curtis, but Wolf has given it his\nown unique twist, injecting a shot of\ndreamy haziness into the experimental documentary genre. Adolescence\nis supposed to be a wonderful, exciting time, and while you could accuse Wolf of romanticising the idea\nof youth (personally, my adolescence\nwas spent in a suburban boredom far\nremoved from the exploits of Evelyn\nWaugh\u2019s peers), he is certainly not the\nfirst to do so. Both informative and\nimaginative, Teenage is a thoroughly\nentertaining film, that draws interesting parallels between the past, the fu-ture, and \u2013 towards the end of the film\n\u2013 the present.\n\n"

The\nproposed nano-porous silver catalyst\nencourages the conversion of carbon\ndioxide into carbon monoxide.\nWhile initially this may not sound\nlike a victory, it is simply the first step;\nthe carbon monoxide produces can\nbe fed as a reactant in the FischerTropsch process, which is used to\ncreate synthetic fuels.\nCarbon dioxide is one of the most\nabundant greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere, but the concentration of\nthegasisontheincrease.Animportant\narea of research at the moment is\ncapturing surplus carbon dioxide in\nthe atmosphere and converting it into\nless harmful products. Doing this in an\nefficient way is still a major challenge\nfor sustainable energy research.\nCommonly, a silver catalyst is the\nchoice material when reacting carbon\ndioxide due to the high selectivity\nand relatively low cost. Additionally,\nthe inorganic nature of silver means\nit remains stable under high reaction\nconditions. Previous research studied\nthe effects of using low potentials on\nsilver particles in ionic electrolytes.\nHowever, the cost of liquid\nelectrolytes, as well as their sensitivity\nmoisture means that there is room for\nimprovement.\nThe researchers found that with\nswitching from a commonly used\npolycrystalline to their novel nano-porous silver electro catalyst structure\nefficiency achieved rose to 92%, an\nimportant success for the project.\nFeng Jiao, an assistant professor\nof chemical and biochemical\nengineering, led the project, which\ndeliveredpromisingresults.Jiao\u2019steam\ncreated the catalyst structure with\nan extremely large surface\narea (150 times greater\nthan its polycrystalline\ncounterpart) and the\ncurved surface means there\nare a high number of active\nsites (at least 20 times\nmore than polycrystalline).\nThis resulted in a reaction\nactivity three orders of\nmagnitude higher, and with\nonly a moderate potential\nof less than 500 mV.\n\u201c[The] selective\nconversion of carbon\ndioxide to carbon\nmonoxide is a promising\nroute for clean energy but\nit is a technically difficult\nprocess to accomplish,\u201d\nJiao said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful\nthat the catalyst we have\ndeveloped can pave the way\ntoward future advances in\nthis area.\u201d\nDOI:\n10.1038/ncomms4242 The nano-polycrystalline structure converts the carbon dioxide molecules to carbon monoxide\nT\nhere are few scientific\ntechniques that have had\nsuch an enormous influence\nacross so many disciplines\nas crystallography.\nIn the past 100 years, it has led to\nno fewer than 28 Nobel Prizes for\ndiscoveries from right across the\nnatural sciences, and remains one\nthe best ways we have of determining\nthe nanoscale structure of everything\nfrom proteins to microprocessors.\nIn an effort to raise awareness\nof the technique\u2019s extraordinary\nachievements, the UN has named\n2014 the International Year of\nCrystallography. The year was\nselected to commemorate the 100th\nanniversary of the award of the Nobel\nPrize in physics to Max von Laue, who\nfirst discovered that X-rays could be\ndiffracted by crystals.\nJust a year later, the prize went to\nWilliam Henry Bragg and his son\nWilliam Lawrence for developing\nthis technique to discover crystal\nstructures. By firing X-rays directly\nat a crystal and observing the pattern\nthey make as they pass through, they\ncould determine the spacing between\nthe layers of the crystal lattice, and its\noverall structure.\nThe crystal acts a bit like a diffraction\ngrating, with the waves being spread\nout by the spaces between atoms. For\nthe waves to be diffracted, they need to\nhave a wavelength as close as possible\nto the atomic spacing (a few hundred\npicometres), which is why X-rays\nare ideal. However, other particles,\nincluding neutrons and electrons, are\nalso sometimes used.\nX-ray diffraction crystallography\nhas given us a detailed understanding\nof much more complex molecules\nthan the simple lattices the Braggs first\nlooked at. Its most famous discovery\ncame in 1953, at King\u2019s College\nLondon, as a team led by Rosalind\nFranklin and Maurice Wilkins were\ntrying to analyse DNA using X-rays.\nOne of the biggest problems faced\nby Franklin and Wilkins was trying\nto create perfect crystals from DNA\nsamples. Large molecules, like DNA\nor proteins, have to be extremely pure\nbefore they will crystallise, and it often\ntakes weeks or months to get a good\nenough crystal to form.\nEventually, they managed to produce\nan image of the molecule that allowed\nFrancis Crick and James Watson,\nworking under Lawrence Bragg in\nCambridge, to establish the shape of\nthe DNA double helix.\nSince then, crystallography has been\nwidely used to\ndetermine the\nstructures of\na huge variety\nof biological\nmolecules. In the\n1950s and 60s,\nDorothy Hodgkin\nbecame the first\nto determine\nthe structure\nof vitamin B12\nand penicillin,\nwinning the 1963\nNobel Prize in\nchemistry for her\ndiscoveries.\nEven today, it\u2019s\nstill one of the\nbest techniques\nwe have of\ndetermining the\nstructure of large\nmolecules; one of\nthe main uses of\nthe \u00a3300 million\nDiamond Light Source in Oxfordshire,\nthe UK\u2019s national synchrotron facility,\nis to generate extremely intense X-rays\nfor use in crystallography.\nIn structural biology, major\ndiscoveries can be made about the\nbehaviour of, say, a protein or virus, by\ngetting a very detailed understanding\nof its shape. Just a few years ago, in\n2009, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\nwas awarded for the discovery of\nthe structure of the ribosome, the\napparatus in cells that makes proteins,\nusing the technique.\nBut despite this list of achievements,\ncrystallography remains relatively\nunknown outside scientific circles.\nPerhaps the International Year\nof Crystallography will help it be\nrightfully seen as one of the most\nimportant techniques in science.\nUniversity of Delaware finds a new non-porous silver catalyst\n\n"

Fry them in oil\ntill cooked through. Prep whichever\nvegetables you like (I used onions,\ngarlic, carrots and mushrooms) and\nfry them together in a pan. When\nthey\u2019re done, add the cooked pork\nthen 200ml of double cream and a few\nsplashes of milk.\nRoll out the pastry you made earlier.\nIf you lack a rolling pin \u2013 an empty\nwine or spirit bottle will do. Take a\ncasserole dish, add the veg/meat mix,\nthen lie the pastry on top and cut the\nexcess around the edges. I took the\ncut-off excess and cut them into a \u2018P\u2019\nto put on top of the pie. I suggest you\nadd the remainder to a separate tray\nto cook \u2013 everyone likes extra pastry!\nCut a hole in the top of the pastry and\nglaze with a bit of milk. If you don\u2019t\nhave a brush, splash some milk over\nwith your fingers and use the back of\na spoon to spread it.\nStick it in the oven at 180C, check it\nafter 25 minutes \u2013 should take around\n30 minutes depending on how thick\nyour pastry is.\nHeat up a frying pan with some oil\nand take the strip of fatty skin from\nearlier. Season the side then place skin\nside down in the pan. Use a heavy dish\non top to hold it flat and fry till it\u2019s\ncooked and all lovely and crispy.\nI did some mash on the side \u2013 boil\nsome potatoes then add milk and\nbutter before mashing. If you\u2019re\nfeeling posh, try using sweet potatoes\nor butternut squash instead.\nskelwithsuppers.wordpress.com\nDo you write a\nfood blog or just\nlove cooking?\nShare it with fellow Imperialites on\nFelix Food!\nEmail food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Shiori\n45 Moscow Rd, W2 4AH\ntheshiori.com // 02072219790\nOpen Tue-Sat. Lunch slots 1230/1300,\nDinner slots 1830/1900 and 2000/2030\nNewsflash: Upmarket Japanese cuisine\nis more than just sushi \u2013 there\u2019s a\nwhole other world of stuff out there.\nUnfortunately here in London,\nupmarket Japanese usually means sushi\nor fusion restaurants like Nobu. This\nmeans that when there\u2019s a restaurant\nabout that serves something unique in\nthe sea of sushi-teis, I\u2019m all over it like\na rash.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re a student!\u201d you cry. Well\nas London\u2019s riddled with lovely eating\nestablishments begging to be explored;\nI\u2019m willing to let my foodie side win and\nmake a once-in-a-blue-moon exception\nfor special occasions. A going-away\nmeal for the equally-foodie boyfriend\ncertainly warranted it.\nLocated in a tranquil side street in\nChinese-roast-duck-laden-Bayswater,\nThe Shiori specializes in Kyoto\u2019s multi-course kaiseki-ryori. It\u2019s like a mini-banquet of all the authentic grub Japan\nhas to offer \u2013 you could say that the\nconcept of modern-day western tasting\nmenus stemmed from it (just that\nthe Japanese have been at it for WAY\nlonger.)\nThe small size of the restaurant (12-16\nseats!) lends to its lovely intimate feel.\nChef Takashi Takagi, who used to run\nSushi of Shiori on Drummond Street\nand cooked at Mayfair\u2019s Umu, is the sole\nchef. Hitomi, his wife, hosts and serves\npatrons with the help of one other\nassistant. Course after course came\nout, each looking and tasting exquisite,\nand each being preceded with a small\nexplanation by the congenial and funny\nHitomi (ingredients, how best to eat it,\netc.) She\u2019ll most certainly sort you out\nfor sake pairings too \u2013 novices, relax!\nThe menu itself (no a la carte by the\nway) is seasonal, making the best of\nboth local and Japanese produce \u2013\nwhich does mean prices can rise or drop\nslightly with the season. We recommend\nthe full tasting menu with 11 courses;\nhowever there are more affordable\npared-down options available.\nPrice-wise, it\u2019s no Wasabi; but that\u2019s\nEat-out Pick of the Week\nmost Japanese in general. You *are*\nhowever paying for all the detail and\neffort that goes into each dish, plus the\nquality of ingredients is bar none. We\ndo advise that you take your time and\nenjoy your grub; this is not the place to\ncome for a \u201cquick\u201d all you can eat! As for\nhow filling it is \u2013 both my boyfriend and\nI have huge appetites, and we found our\nmeal was deceptively sufficient despite\nthe small-ish size of each course. They\nusually offer seconds (\u201cokawari\u201d) of the\nrice course should you want it.\nAll in all, while The Shiori is one of\nthose places you\u2019d assigned the cliched\n\u201chidden gem\u201d term to, the premise is\nanything but cliche. The food speaks for\nitself; personable Japanese hospitality\ntakes it above and beyond.\nCouples, if you can get a reservation\nthis Valentine\u2019s Day (or maybe later on)\n\u2013 you will most certainly be spoilt, so\nyou\u2019re in for a treat! Just go easy on the\nPDA, as Hitomi herself quipped (with\na cute Japanese shudder) \u2013 \u201chow do\npeople engage in full-on kissing while\neating sashimi? You\u2019re here for the food,\nsurely!\u201d -- Carol Ann Cheah, Food Editor\nwow, much eats - very beauty. here are all 11 courses we had - bet you can\u2019t identify more than the rice/soups/sashimi!\n\n"
