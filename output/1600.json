Photo: Wikimedia Commons\nUtsav Radia on Imperial research that could lead to the first vaccine\n\"This new\nclass of\nantibodies\npoints\nthe way\nfor a new\napproach\nto a dengue\nvaccine.\"\nResearchers from the\nDepartment of Medicine at\nImperial have identified a new\nclass of antibodies that is effective\nagainst the virus that causes dengue\nfever.\nDengue is a mosquito-borne\nviral infection found primarily in\ntropical and sub-tropical regions\naround the world. However, in\nrecent years, transmission has\nincreased predominantly in urban\nand semi-urban areas leading it to\nbecome a major international public\nhealth concern with an estimated\n400 million infections occurring\nannually.\nOver 2.5 billion people (over 40% of\nthe world\u2019s population) are now at risk\nfrom dengue and the World health\nOrganisation (WHO) estimates there\nmay be 50-100 million infections\nworldwide every year.\nThe primary vector of dengue is\nthe Aedes aegypti mosquito, which\nlives in urban habitats and breeds\nmostly in man-made containers.\nUnlike other mosquitoes, Ae. aegypti\nis a daytime feeder, with the females\nbiting multiple people during each\nfeeding period. Initially, the virus is\ntransmitted from infected humans\nto uninfected mosquitoes, the virus\nsubsequently incubates for 4-10\ndays in the mosquito, after which\nthe infected mosquito is capable of\ntransmitting the virus for the rest of\nits life.\nPatients who are already infected\nwith the dengue virus can transmit\nthe infection for usually 4-5 days\n(max. 12) via Aedes mosquitoes after\nthe onset of symptoms; the virus\ncannot be transmitted from person to\nperson.\nDengue fever is a severe, flu-like\nillness that can affect people of all\nages, but seldom causes death. It is\nsuspected when patients have a high\nfever accompanied by two of the\nfollowing symptoms: severe headache,\npain behind the eyes, muscle and\njoint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen\nglands or rash. Symptoms usually\npersist for around one to two weeks.\nOccasionally, dengue fever can\ndevelop into a more aggressive form\ncalled severe dengue (also known as\ndengue haemorrhagic fever) which\nis a fatal complication as it can lead\nto shock (a sudden drop in blood\npressure), bleeding and organ failure.\nAs there is no vaccine as yet for the\ndengue virus, the best way to prevent\ninfection is using common sense\nprecautions \u2013 such as hand washing,\nwearing protective clothing and using\nmosquito repellent \u2013 whilst travelling\nto high-risk areas.\nThe dengue virus has four differnt\nstrains, called serotypes, which are\ndistinguished from each other by\ntheir surface antigens. Recovering\nfrom infection by one provides\nlifelong immunity against that\nparticular serotype; however, if an\nindividual were to be infected by\nanother serotype, cross-recognition\nby the immune system of the\nother one may only be partial and\ntemporary, increasing the risk of\ndeveloping severe dengue.\nFortunately, researchers from\nthe Department of Medicine at\nImperial, in collaboration with\nscientists from the Institut Pasteur\nin Paris, have identified a new class\nof antibodies that is effective against\nall four serotypes of the dengue virus.\nAntibodies are proteins produced by\nimmune cells (B-lymphocytes) that\ncan recognise and selectively bind\nto specific parts (called epitopes) of\nforeign objects called antigens.\nThe binding of the antibodies to\nantigens on microorganisms such as\nbacteria and viruses are what help\nour immune system recognise them\nas being foreign, so it can attack them\nand neutralise their harmful effects\non our body.\nIn the study, published in the\njournal Nature Immunology, the\nscientists analysed blood samples of\ninfected patients in Southeast Asia to\nexamine the antibodies produced by\ntheir immune systems. In the process,\nthe scientists identified a previously\nunknown epitope, referred to as\nthe \u201cenvelope dimer epitope\u201d (EDE)\nwhich \u2018bridges\u2019 protein subunits on\nmature virions (the infective form\nof the virus, as inside the body)\nand is common to all four strains.\nMonoclonal antibodies, characterized\nin the study, to the EDE showed a\nstrong response across all four strains\nof the dengue virus.\nThese antibodies could potentially\nbe used either directly in the\nprevention and treatment of dengue\ninfections or in the development of\nsubunit vaccines that could be used\nto stimulate the immune system to\nproduce antibodies to the EDE.\n\"Over 2.5\nbillion\npeople are\nnow at\nrisk from\ndengue.\"\nIn a second paper, published in\nNature, the researchers analysed the\nstructure of the antibodies, which\nforms the basis of developing a\nvaccine.\nProfessor Screaton, lead of the\nstudy, expressed that \u201ccurrent vaccine\ntrials [for dengue] have shown some\npromise but do not fully protect from\ninfection\u2026this new class of antibodies\npoints the way for a new approach to\na dengue vaccine design which we are\npursuing\u201d.\nUp till now, there was no\nspecifically directed treatment for\ndengue apart from paracetamol,\nreplenished fluid intake and resting;\nthis new antibody approach has\nopened many further treatment\navenues for exploration. So it seems\nlike we may not be far off from being\nable to greatly enhance our armoury\nin tackling the rising incidences\nof dengue virus infections and\ncomplications in the near future.\nDOI: 10.1038/ni.3058;\n10.1038/nature14130\n\n"

These technocratic\nbodies would be comprised of\nrespected scientists, selected from\na wide range of disciplines and\nuniversities around the country.\nIndividuals on this body would\nhave to be knowledgeable about\nthe political system and would face\nperiodic review. They would be\nallowed to veto policy and legislation,\nas well as proposing their own\nalternatives.\nComing from a wide range of\nlegitimate research, these bodies are\nable to make decisions which are\ngrounded in research and evidence-based methods. They can, therefore,\nchoose cost \u2013 and energy \u2013 efficient\nstrategies.\nFurthermore, they are more able to\nlook into the nooks and crannies of\npolicy, while prioritising their areas\nof research, instead of pandering to\nsolely political agendas.\nThis is especially effective for those\npolicies which get very little public\ndiscussion.\nIn as much as each of these\nscientists has an incentive to\nmaintain their own credibility, they\nare self-regulating, and best placed to\nunderstand highly technical policy\ndecisions.\nScience is above politics. That\nis not to say that the results\nof science don\u2019t have political\nramifications, but the results\nthemselves are true or false, whether\nor not they affect the world.\nFor each of the issues we are\ndiscuss \u2013 climate change, drug\npolicy or reproductive medicine \u2013\nit is important that the science is\ndeliberated in a setting with as little\ninterference as possible.\nBy giving an unelected body\nof scientists power over people\u2019s\nlives, we irrevocably destroy the\nimpartiality of science. This takes\naway the little influence that science\nhas in policy, by politicising scientific\nfact.\nUnder the status quo, scientists act\nas advisors, and can affect policy by\ntelling the government the correct\ncourse of action. The government\ncan, of course, ignore this advice,\nbut the scientific community can\nthen publicly campaign against the\ngovernment. Voters can therefore\ntrust that scientists are not changing\nthe facts for political gain, and so\nare unlikely to support politicians\nwho actively oppose the scientific\nmainstream.\nThis balance of power is not true in\nthe US for many potential reasons,\nbut the effect is that science becomes\na topic for political debate. Politicians\nhave confidence to argue the scientific\ncase rather than the political. When\nunelected scientists in the UK become\npart of the political decision making\nprocess, British politicians are forced\nto engage on these kind of terms.\nThe public will now no longer see\nthe difference between the politics\nand the science. When people\nunderstand the political incentives\nthat could be affecting the decisions\nof these technocrats, they no longer\ntrust in the scientific opinion.\nPeople will not trust these scientists\non the science, whether or not they\nhave been politicised. Any doubt at all\nwill diminish support for things like\nclimate change from the ground up.\nSo overall we get a collapse of\nsupport, and no political capital\nwithin Parliament to engage with\nimpending threats like climate\nchange. But what about trust in\nscience?The day that people can no\nlonger support scientific endeavour\nwithout doubt will precede the day\nwhen science itself can no longer\nprogress. The backlash; funding cuts\nand fear of political bias will continue\nto destroy the scientific community\nfor as long as this technocratic body is\nallowed to exist.\nBy doing this we would lose both\ngood policy and good science.\n\"they are\nmore able\nto look\ninto the\nnooks and\ncrannies\nof policy...\ninstead of\npandering\nto soley\npolitical\nagendas.\"\n\"funding\ncuts and\nfear of\npolitical\nbias will\ncontinue to\ndestroy the\nscientific\ncommunity\"\nPROPOSITION\nANITA CHANDRAN NIALL JEFFREY\nOPPOSITION\nWho wins these head-to-heads from Im\nDo you agree or disagree? Tell us which argument you think is most convi\nBut will change be for the better? Photo: John Ditchburn\n\n"

Set in a slum\noutside the Mumbai airport, the\nplay begins with a stage littered with\nrefuse, waiting to be collected, along\nwith a backdrop of crude temporary\nbuildings. Shane Zaz\u2019s character\nof Abdul Husain is anchored at\ncentre stage sorting rubbish, whilst\nother young characters run around\ncollecting what they can, thus clearing\nthe stage. This scene foreshadowed\nthe tone of the first half of the play,\nnot only in that it shows the frenzied\nnature of the characters\u2019 lives, but\nalso the insincerity of the production,\nwhich extends to the whole play.\nBooming electronic Indian music\nattempts to corroborate and\njustify the pace of this scene, as the\ncharacters frantically run to and fro\nacross the stage. However, the balance\nof the music forcefully reminds the\naudience that they are in a theatre,\nand that the characters moving\naround on stage are performing for\nthem, undermining any possible\nimmersion into the world in which\nthis play is set.\nAt points I doubted the legitimacy\nof the characters; this was not due to\nthe actors ability, but instead because\nof a confused subtext. The characters\u2019\nbehaviour was not validated by\nwhat they were saying, and instead\nI felt like there was a collection\nof ideas and context that filtered\ndown from the original book, via\nthe playwright and director \u2013 some\nof them were coherent, some were\nnow confused, and others weren\u2019t\npresent at all. If you are going to\nadapt a book, and cannot recreate it\nwithout losing some of the content,\nwe need to consider whether the play\ncan stand alone apart from the text.\nIt is important that references and\nbehaviours which become spurious\nin the script and production are\nremoved, otherwise the play loses it\u2019s\nintegrity and becomes confused, as\nthis play did \u2013 allusions were made to\ninternationalisation and the effect it\nhas on local communities, tolerance\nof different religions, and disabilities\nin India, but they were trivialised\nby the illegitimacy of what else was\ngoing on stage.\nThis is a major shame, as such issues\nare current and highlight why the\nbook was successful. The comedy\nwithin the play was inelegant and\nchildish, and thus distracted further\nfrom any serious political discussions\nthat occurred on stage. If this was an\nemployment of Brechtian practices -something I doubt - it only served to\nmake the experience less enjoyable,\nand it was done in vain. Not only was\nthere no distinctive discussion, but\nthe audience were again overly aware\nof being in a theatre.\nThe staging was ambitious: early\non in the play, masses of rubbish\nfall from above the stage, to cover it\nyet again, as it was in the first scene;\nin the closing scene a character\nperforms a jump from scaffolding, to\nhighlight the risks that the characters\nmade to earn money; and the\nmost exceptional part of the whole\nproduction was when lights and\nsound flew a plane over the audiences\nheads. Although the latter device was\nexciting and by no means mediocre,\nit only served as a counterpoint to\nthe rest of the play, and each event\njust seemed like an attempt to wow\nthe audience. Although they were fun\nto watch, it felt disjointed from the\nbulk of the play. Further to the plane\nflying over the audience, the lighting\nwas particularly clever, and effective\nat creating different spaces on a large\nopen stage.\nThe set, which at points was\ndeconstructed and reconstructed, was\nmostly based on a large turntable,\nmeaning the characters could walk\nfrom one scene to the next without\nleaving the audience\u2019s sight. Aside\nfrom the turntable, it felt gimmicky\nand - like the majority of things\nin the play - still couldn\u2019t distract\nfrom the flimsy script. I feel that\nRufus Norris\u2019 direction and David\nHare\u2019s adaptation failed the book,\nthe cast, and the audience, resulting\nin a staging that could do little\nbut distract the audience from the\naforementioned failures \u2013 this play\nis an excellent example of artistry\nnot correlating with size of budget. I\ndon\u2019t, however, doubt the brilliance\nof the book, and I would love to see\nanother adaptation of it, as I am\nsure the stage could be an effective\nmedium through which to discuss the\ntopics involved and for telling such a\nstory. Rufus Norris is the incoming\nDirector of the National Theatre; I\nhope this is an anomaly in his work,\nand the bathos pervading this play\ndoes not extend to his further work at\nthe theatre.\nBehind The Beautiful Forevers is on at\nthe National Theatre\u2019s Olivier Theatre,\nuntil May 5th.\nTickets from \u00a315.\nA scene from the National Theatre\u2019s Behind The Beautiful Forevers Credit: Richard Hubert Smith\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

Fred is a medical\nstudent, and has managed to balance\nhospital rotations with planning\nand putting together forty beautiful\npages; something he\u2019s managed to do\nin a week, but something that took\nme weeks to do when laying out the\nFresher\u2019s issue.\nI am actually slightly concerned\nnow my editorial team have began to\nsurpass me in skill and dedication; it\nis only a matter of time before they\nrealise I\u2019m really now just an office\naccessory, overthrow me and take\nover Felix completely.\nBig shout out to Ben Howitt, who\nhas managed to work some sort of\nInDesign magic into our templates,\nwhilst copy editing like a machine,\nstill finding time to campaign, do his\ndegree and even find some spare time\nto run all his clubs and societies.\nI would also like to praise my\ndedicated and talented Comment\nEditor Tessa, who has managed to\ncommand eight whole pages this week\nit\u2019s not the Sabbatical roles that\nshould be commanding all the\nattention \u2013 the roles that are done\npurely by volunteers can be infinitely\nmore challenging and carry more\nof a direct impact than some of the\nstudent sabbatical roles.\nIt was a group of volunteers that\nbrought together the Meet the\nCandidates program on Wednesday;\nit was a complete group of volunteers\nthat ran ICSM RAG week that\nmanaged to raise so much money,\nand it is volunteers that day on day\nkeep our Union ticking.\nSo if you do decide to vote\ntomorrow or next week, make sure\nyou spend some time thinking about\nwhat people you think would be\nthe best to fill the volunteer roles\nof next year; choose people who are\ndedicated, hardworking, but also\npassionate.\nJoke candidates are great for a bit\nof light relief, but remember that for\nevery joke candidate elected, that is\none role that cannot contribute to the\nwider club, society or project they are\na part of.\nVolunteers make the Union\ntick; they run your clubs, your\nrepresentation network, your sports\nteams and ultimately your student\nvoice.Vote for someone who you\nknow can do the job, do it well but\nalso loves what they do; they may be\nrallying for your vote this week, but\nin the end you\u2019ll be thanking them\nfor making your student experience\nso much more than it would be\nwithout them.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nWe got nothing wrong last\nweek, apparently.\nThis is probably a mistake\nin itself.

    "content": "20 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nScience Editor James Bezer & Lauren Ratcliffe\nScience\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNefeli Maria Skoufou Papoutsaki asks whether the virus could be eradicated\nHope on the horizon for HIV\nHIV (the Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus)\nis one of the most lethal\nviruses. Since the first case in 1959,\n39 million people have died from\nHIV related diseases (including AIDS,\nthe disease caused by the virus, and\nother co-infections such as Hepatitis\nC). However, much progress has\nbeen made in both the detection of\nthe disease and in developing some\npotential treatments or vaccines.\nThere are also reasons to believe that\nthe virus will become less lethal in the\ncoming years.\nThe HIV virus targets the cells of\nthe immune system. More specifically\nit targets the T cells, white blood cells\nthat have as a primary role to kill\ninfected cells and develop memory\ncells that can be quickly formed if\nthe same virus/bacterium infects\nthe body again. The virus is sexually\ntransmitted and causes the widely\nknown disease AIDS. The final stage\nof AIDS is the loss of immunity, so\npatients can die even from a common\nflu, this is why the HIV virus is\nrelated with other co-infections.\nFortunately, leading researchers\nare working on the HIV and AIDS\nproblem. One of the most important\ndiscoveries was the understanding of\nhow HIV replicates. David Baltimore,\nan American biologist, along with his\ncolleagues, discovered the enzyme\nreverse transcriptase that can make\nDNA from RNA, for which they won\nthe Nobel Prize for Physiology or\nMedicine in 1975.\nThis is the enzyme that\nretroviruses, such as HIV, use. They\ndo so because after entering a host\ncell, they need to add their genetic\nmaterial into that of the host cell,\nwhich is in the form of DNA. Many\nantiretroviral therapies (ARTs) can\ninhibit the replication of the virus,\nnow that the mechanism is known.\nAt the Conference on Retroviruses\nand Opportunistic Infections (CROI),\nwhich took place this February in\nSeattle, many important research\nfindings were announced including\nimprovements on current treatments\nas well as scientific breakthroughs.\nFocus was given on the\nimprovements in care of both\nAIDS and Hepatitis C, an infectious\ndisease affecting the liver. HIVpositive people are also susceptible\nto Hepatitis C due to common routes\nof transmission, such as sexual\nintercourse.\nThe relationship between the Ebola\noutbreak and the effects on the HIV\ntreatment were also discussed. It\nhas been observed that in certain\nhospitals in Africa, there is a 50%\ndrop in HIV testing, treatment and\nentry into care, since doctors focus\nmore on the Ebola infection. This\nmay create the need, now more than\never, for a simple and quick diagnosis\nthat people can even conduct on their\nown.\nGenerally, when people are\ndiagnosed and under medical care\nthey are 94% less likely to transmit\nthe virus: something that underlines\nthe importance of an early diagnosis.\nA group of researchers at Columbia\nUniversity have developed a low cost\nsmartphone accessory that can detect\nin 15 minutes from a blood sample\nwhether the patient is HIV-positive or\nwhether he has syphilis. The next step\nis to bring the accessory to developing\ncountries, after modifying it, since\nmost people there do not possess a\nsmartphone.\nConcerning the treatment of HIV,\nthere is a substantial problem that\nmay have been overcome recently\nby a group of researchers in the\nUniversity of California Technology:\nwhy natural antibodies don\u2019t work in\nthe treatment of HIV.\nAntibodies are Y-shaped proteins\nthat attach to the surface of viruses in\nthe receptors or spikes they have in\norder to destroy the viral cells. This\nprocess is more effective when both\n\u201carms\u201d bind the spikes. In HIV cells\nthese spikes are fewer and in much\nlarger distance so the \u201carms\u201d of the\nantibodies cannot reach two spikes\nat once.\nWhat this group did was to develop\nantibody based molecules that can\nbind both their arms at a single spine.\nThe successful molecules managed\nto neutralize the HIV 10-1,000 times\nmore effectively than the naturally\noccurring antibodies.\nRecently a drug candidate has been\nobserved that could be potentially\nused as a vaccine for HIV, since it is\nthe most effective inhibitor found so\nfar. It can block every strain of HIV-1\nand HIV-2 that has been isolated\nfrom humans.\nAnother point of the HIV cycle\nthat is usually targeted by drugs is\nto prevent the entry in the host cell.\nThis drug can bind to two points of\nthe HIV simultaneously to more\neffectively prevent this entry. Also,\nif an adeno-associated virus that can\neasily be weakened is injected, it can\nturn cells into factories that produce\nthis drug candidate that can last for\nyears; even decades.\nAs well as its effects on the immune\nsystem, HIV can also have effects\non the brain. There are many HIV\nassociated neurocognitive disorders\n(HANDs), usually found in patients\nover 50 years old.\nThe virus prevents the cell from\nclearing its damaged proteins, in\na process known as autophagy.\nDisrupting autophagy can cause\nthe death of the cell when all these\ndamaged molecules accumulate in\nhigh concentrations. The cancer drug\nrapamycin that enhances autophagy\nhas been tested in HIV patients and\nindeed reduced damage of neurons\nwas observed.\nHope is also seen on the horizon for\nthe HIV pandemic since the virus has\nbeen found to evolve in less aggressive\nforms in Africa. One reason for that\nmay be because of the wide use of the\nHIV drugs which can decrease the\npossibility of transmission.\nAnother reason for that may be that\nthe virus is evolving in a form that\nwould result in a slower infection so\nthat the hosts can survive for longer\nand thus make it more likely for the\nvirus to be transmitted to others.\nAlthough this is may not be the\ncase of the evolution of virus in the\nEurope and the US, at least patients\nthere can benefit from all the other\nadvances in treatment and diagnosis\nmentioned before, if all these actually\nwork in vivo.\nHIV under the microscope: New treatments in the past 20 years have significantly reduced the number of people dying of AIDS.\nPhoto: imgkid.com\n\"When\npeople\nhave been\ndiagnosed,\nthey are 94%\nless likely to\ntransmit the\nvirus.\"\n\"HIV can also\nhave effects\non the brain.\"\n\n"

I think the\nacademic benefits of attending\nImperial College London are not\ndisputed, so I will instead focus on\nwhy I think the College is good for us,\nand how the problems are just as bad\nat other Universities. If we were not\nat Imperial we would be at another\nRussell Group University doing the\nsame hard degrees.\nIf we went anywhere else we would\nbe working just as hard, however\nunlike at Imperial, most people\nwouldn\u2019t be. If half of your flat is\ngoing out three nights a week while\nyou have to stay in doing work, that is\nworse for you than if they\u2019re all stuck\ninside doing problem sheets, because\nyou don\u2019t feel anti-social or lonely. In\nfact, working at Imperial becomes a\nsocial experience. No friend is better\nthan the one you make at 03:00 in the\nlibrary, because you have something\nto bond over.\nThe other complaint I often hear is\nhow the College does not care about\nits students.\nEvery University has this problem.\nI have heard about things happening\nat other Universities that I can\u2019t\nimagine happening at Imperial:\nlecturers forbidding students from\nasking questions, ridiculous rules on\ntransferring between courses. The\nCollege may be ineffective but at least\nit seems like it\u2019s trying, and that\u2019s a\ndamn sight better than most places.\nImperial actually stacks up quite\nwell against other Universities.\nIt is no more anti-student than\nthe likes of Manchester, and it\u2019s in\na beautiful part of one of the most\namazing cities on Earth. The facilities\nare excellent, and it\u2019s full of brilliant\npeople doing amazing science. The\nlecturers are as variable as anywhere\nelse, but at least here they know their\nstuff, even if they\u2019re not great at\nexplaining it.\nI have met some of the most\ninteresting and enthusiastic people I\nhave ever met here. There is a genuine\nsense of community here because we\nall have so much in common: we\u2019re\nall nerds, we all love science. Imperial\nallows us to occupy our weird niche\ntogether and we will never get that\nanywhere else.\nLooking back it\u2019s clear that the\n17 year old me got four out my five\nUCAS options completely wrong.\nThe one I definitely got right was\nImperial.\nForget \u2018Education\u2019 \u2013 what\nmatters is your ability to\nget a job, be well paid for it,\nand what you go through to get it.\nWe\u2019re told that Imperial is great\nfor this. That\u2019s overstated. What\u2019s\nunderstated is the unnecessarily\nlaissez-faire process to get there.\n87.8% employability? That\u2019s inflated\nby the huge Medic population, which,\nthanks to the NHS, are gifted with\n100% employability, both here and\nat twenty of the other thirty medical\nschools in the country. In other\nwords, if you\u2019re not a Medic the figure\nis lower, and if you are, you gained\nnothing by coming here.\n\u201cImperial grads get the highest\nsalary\u201d. One word: banking. If you\ncame here with a genuine interest\nin your subject, you can forget that\nsalary. Sorry. What do I say to those\nwho are looking to shuffle code\n12 hours a day for Barclays? You\nneed free time to spend money, so\nmy advice is to find a contract that\nincludes some.\nSo the idea that \u2018Imperial degrees\nare harder to get but it\u2019s worth it in\nthe end,\u2019 quite frankly, dies a death.\nGiven that you don\u2019t get anything\nfrom your degree unless you pass,\nit therefore seems futile to choose\nsomewhere that seems so willing to\ndrop you if you can\u2019t keep up.\nWhat about societies? Perhaps we\ncan have a great time along the way?\nIt\u2019s great that there\u2019s loads of variety,\nbut that doesn\u2019t make a difference if\nyou only have time for one. But it\u2019s\nnice that you can aspire to the top\nsporting societies who are welcoming\nto Freshers, avoid blatant sexism, and\nreject the \u201clad culture\u201d. Oh wait...\nAnd what do we pay for this?\nTuition may be capped, but rents sure\naren\u2019t. Bear in mind that Queen Mary\nstudents commuting from Stratford\npay on average 40% less rent that\nyou do commuting the same distance\nfrom Hammersmith, and that\u2019s\nwithout leaving Central London.\nSo you pay loads, work hard, and\nget a degree that is little better than\nanywhere else. So if we could go back\nto when we got our offr? This house\nwould not accept.\n\"Imperial\nallows us to\noccupy our\nweird niche\ntogether\nand we\nwill never\nget that\nanywhere\nelse.\"\n\"you pay\nloads, work\nhard, and\nget a degree\nthat is little\nbetter than\nanywhere\nelse.\"\nBRUCE WEAVER KRISTIAN LENDING\nPROPOSITION OPPOSITION\nmperial College Union Debating Society?\nIf you like these head-to-heads,or\nif you think you could do better,\njoin ICU Debating Society.They\nmeet every Tuesday at 6.30pm in\nSAF,and anyone is welcome to go\nalong.Alternatively,email debate@\nimperial.ac.uk\nincing online, or by using the QR codes below!\nQueen\u2019s Tower is definitely a plus point.

Most deniers said that there\nwas either no evidence for global\nwarming, or that the recent warming\nof the Earth was due to natural\nclimate variability. In contrast, 87%\nof scientists from the American\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nScience (AAAS) surveyed believed\nthat the burning of fossil fuels\nhas caused climate change. The\nAmerican public\u2019s ignorance and the\ngap between scientists and general\nsociety\u2019s opinion highlight the need to\npromote a greater understanding and\npublic engagement in climate change.\nSmall but mighty\nFirst appearances can be deceptive.\nSo you\u2019ll hear a lot of statistics being\nflown about, such as atmospheric\ntemperatures have increased by 0.74\ndegrees over the last decade. Perhaps\nyou\u2019ll think \u201cso what?\u201d. However,\nthese seemingly insignificant changes\nenvironmental conditions can have\nmuch greater consequences for the\nEarth and humanity than you may\ninitially think.\nIncreased emissions of strongly\nionising chemicals (nitrous oxides and\nsulphates) cause ocean and freshwater\nacidification, which directly impacts\nbiodiversity, destroying coral reefs\nand any calcified organisms around. A\nprojected decrease of 0.4 units on the\npH scale in the forthcoming decade\nmay not seem much but considering\nthat the scale is logarithmic, this\ntranslates to a 100-150% increase in\nacidity which is more than we have\nseen over the last 50 million years.\nThe two major ice sheets that are\nmelting at an accelerating rate are\nGreenland and West Antarctic,\ncontributing an 8 and 6 mm/year\nrise in sea surface levels respectively.\nOverall the sea level has increased\n1.5m in the last decade and is\npredicted to further rise 0.75-2m\nduring our lifetimes. This may also\nseem pretty puny but will have\nhuge consequences for regions such\nas New Orleans and Miami. None\nof the Maldives is more than 1.8m\nabove sea level, and according to\nIPCC predictions the island will be\nrendered uninhabitable by 2100.\nSo, what's being done?\nClimate change is now taking more\nof the limelight within international\npolitical agendas. Obama wisely said\n\u201cthis isn\u2019t something in the distant\nfuture, climate change is already\naffecting us now.\u201d Compare that to\n2002 when former president George\ned dish. Don\u2019t believe me?\nhas happened in the past and it is\na natural part of Earth\u2019s history.\nHowever, the difference this time is\nthat it is us that have caused these\nchanges.\nNot all scientists agree\nNope, they do. Well, the majority of\nthem anyway. In 2013 a survey of\nthousands of scientific papers taking\na position on climate change found\n97.1% of the scientific community\nbelieved that humans were causing\nclimate change. In addition, the\nlatest assessment report from the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC) stated \u201cmost of\nthe observed increase in globally\naveraged temperatures since the mid-20th\ncentury is very likely due to the\nobserved increase in anthropogenic\ngreenhouse gas concentrations\u201d.\nOf course there are always sceptics\nout there. Just this week Senator\nJames Inhofe, a Republican from\nOklahoma and long-standing climate\ndenier, threw a snowball in congress\nto prove that global warming was\na myth. His facile argument was\nthat if it\u2019s cold enough to snow\nin Washington, D.C., then global\nwarming must be a hoax. This is not\njust some nut off the street, he could\npotentially be a leading controller of\nenvironmental legislation, which is\npretty terrifying. This also touches\non another myth that should really\nbe squashed flat. Temperatures can\ngo up and down month-to-month,\nyear-to-year, but the overall trend\nis upwards. It\u2019s true, this February\nhas been the capital\u2019s coldest in 36\nyears but that holds no ground as\nevidence to undermine the argument\nthat greenhouse-gas emissions are\nwarming the planet over the course of\ndecades.\nAt the end of this January a major\nsurvey of around 4,000 US citizens\u2019\nopinions on global warming revealed\nthat only half the population agreed\nwith the IPCC that climate change\nwas mostly driven by human\nBush rejected participation in the\nKyoto protocol and you can see\nwe\u2019re going in the right direction.\nObama here also hits on something\nthat is very important. Historically\nhumanity cannot be trusted with\nthe future tense, trading short-term gain for long-term pain. So\ninternational agreements are needed\nthat emphasise the effect of climate\nchange to us now, rather than in some\ndistant future.\nOne of the most important\ninternational actions against climate\nchange in recent times has been the\nKyoto Protocol, which binds member\nstates to reducing GHG emissions.\nThis international agreement\nrecently evolved during the Lima\nclimate change conference back in\nDecember last year. Ever since the\nUN Framework Convention on\nClimate Change was signed in 1992,\ncountries\u2019 obligations have been\ndefined according to their level of\ndevelopment in that year. The rich\nso-called \u2018Annex 1\u2019 countries have\nhad compulsory obligations, while\npoorer \u2018non-Annex 1\u2019 were required\nto attempt voluntary efforts.\nHowever, this division has grown\never more obsolete as developing\ncountries such as Brazil, Russia,\nIndia and China are getting more\nindustrialised and becoming major\nemitters of GHGs, so they are all\nnow being committed to compulsory\nobligations. In addition, the\nubiquitous limit to global warming\nof 2 degrees above pre-industrial\nlevel has been agreed on. It\u2019s worth\nknowing that this threshold has not\nactually been agreed by scientific\nadvisers but by politicians.\nWe\u2019ve also seen the disinvestment\nmovement grow from strength to\nstrength in the last few months\nas environmental policy changes\nthreaten to render fossil fuel\ninvestments worthless in the\nforthcoming years. One to watch out\nfor this winter is the next United\nNations Climate Change Conference;\nit will be interesting to see how\ndifferent nations will agree to limit\ntheir greenhouse gas emissions. So\nwatch this space.\nClimate change is like an unwashed\ndish, left in your bedroom, pushed\nunder a bed and forgotten about.\nTackle it straight away and you\u2019ll\nsave yourself a lot of trouble in the\nlong-term. Leave it and surrender\nto blissful ignorance and you\u2019ll find\nyourself with the marigolds on,\ndisinfectant in hand, scraping away\nfungal growth or throwing out the\ndish altogether.\nyths surrounding this global conundrum\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 69\nFELIX 06.03.2015\nKamil McClelland reviews Peter Sellars\u2019 contemporary take on a classic\nThe Indian Queen \u2014 Purcell\u2019s Final Flourish\nTo call this production of The\nIndian Queen at the ENO\nPurcell\u2019s opera might be seen\nas unfaithful to the extent to which\nPeter Sellars has reinvented the work.\nFirst performed in 1695 only a short\nwalk away at Theatre Royal in Drury\nLane, The Indian Queen was Henry\nPurcell\u2019s final work, for he was to pass\naway tragically prematurely later that\nyear. Based on a libretto of the same\nname written thirty years previously\nby John Dryden, Purcell was unable\nto finish the work, and hence it has\nbeen largely left abandoned from\nthe contemporary repertoires of\nthe world\u2019s great opera houses. Yet,\nas brilliantly illustrated in this\ninterpretation of the piece, Purcell\u2019s\nmusic still carries all of the weight\nand majesty of his original vision,\nproving to any listeners that he was a\ntrue master of Baroque opera.\nBut why do I act as if Sellars\u2019 version\nof the work, originally performed in\n2013, is almost an entirely new work,\nor at least one that would be largely\nunrecognisable to the great Purcell\nhimself? Well, in typical Sellars\nfashion he has turned his nose up at\northodoxy, creating a work as unique\nas his colourful dress sense or spiked\nup hair. From the colourful stage\ndesign by Angeleno graffiti artist\nGronk, to the accompanying text by\nNicaraguan writer Rosario Aguilar,\noverflowing with emotion, this is a\ncollaboration of the arts in the truest\nsense, full of intrigue and excitement,\nonce again showing why Sellars is one\nof the most highly acclaimed opera\ndirectors of our time.\nThis production forms part of\nSellars\u2019 six month residency at\nthe ENO, one that he described\nas \u201cvery exciting\u201d due to their\n\u201cconsistent artistic excellence\u201d and\n\u201clack of orthodoxy\u201d. As well as this\nproduction, he took on Adams\u2019 The\nGospel According To The Other Mary,\nwhich ran during last November\nand December, to great success. I was\nexcited to see what The Indian Queen\nheld for me. I couldn\u2019t honestly\nsay that I knew the work well at all\nbeforehand, but I knew that whenever\nSellars gets his hands on something it\nis going to be interesting.\nWhilst Dryden\u2019s original text tells\nthe story of Latin America before\nthe Spanish Conquest, Sellars has\ncompletely rewritten it, describing\nit as \u201cunrevivable\u201d due to its highly\nstylised take on the theme, as if\nit were some kind of French love\nstory. Instead, he has transported\nthe story forward a generation, to\nthe horror and barbarism of the\nconquistadors, raping and pillaging as\nthey went. And not only that, but he\nhas reformulated it using text from\nThe Lost Chronicles of Terra Firma, a\nMaritxell Carrero and Julia Bullock in The Indian Queen. Photo: ENO /\nRichard Hubert Smith\nnovel by Rosario Aguilar telling the\nstory of Mayan colonisation from a\nfemale standpoint. It is the tale of an\nIndian Queen, performed incredibly\nsensitively by Julia Bullock, married\noff to a sadistic Spanish general,\nwhom she then falls helplessly in love\nwith as he continues to destroy the\nculture and heritage of her people\naround her. It is an agonising insight\ninto a story lost in the annals of\nhistory.\nThe opera opens with a series\nof Mayan creation scenes,\ncontextualising the rich spiritual\nheritage that existed when Spanish\nforces, emotionless with their camo\ngear and assault rifles, arrived.\nIn turn, panels painted by Gronk\ndescend from above like a deity, a\nmonolith akin to Kubrick\u2019s creation\nmyths in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Ballet\ndancers act out these tales, elegantly\nchoreographed by Christopher\nWilliams, occupying the stage with\nall the majesty of the gods they\nrepresent.\nAnd how does 17th\nCentury\nbaroque music from Western Europe\npossibly accompany a story like\nthis, dark and full of pain? Well, to\nmy utter disbelief, perfectly! I think\nSellars describes it perfectly when\nhe says Purcell\u2019s score is \u201cthe most\nemotionally overwhelming music I\nhave ever put on stage\u201d. Incorporating\nboth the original music as well some\nof Purcell\u2019s other religious works, a\nsoundscape is created that is at one\nmoment ethereal and in the next,\nheartbreaking \u2013 truly breathtaking.\nI cannot leave this review without\ngoing into more depth about graffiti\nartist Gronk\u2019s unbelievable stage\ndesign. Each panel that descends\nfrom above, as if from heaven, is an\nartwork in itself, not merely some\nprop to aid understanding of the\nstory; it is the story, as integral to\nit as any other part. He manages to\nembody the rich artistic heritage of\nLatin America, from the dazzling\ncolours to the naturalistic designs to\nthe anthropomorphic animal-god\nfigures boldly defined on canvas,\nsimultaneously bursting with energy\nand static, like a relief on the side\nof a Mayan pyramid at Chichen\nItza. They impose themselves upon\nthe stage with all the epicness of\npre-Columbian temples, as if the\nwhole opera is being performed in a\nvast religious space, with dramatic\nshadows projected onto them from\nthe clever front-lighting. It is a\nwonder to behold, well worth the\nvisit, let alone the accompanying\ngenius of Purcell\u2019s music. I really\ndo hope for further collaborations\nbetween graffiti artists and opera\nhouses, whether Gronk or someone\nelse. No other group of artists have\nsuch a command and understanding\nof decorating space, whether it be our\ndaily architectural surroundings or a\nWest End stage \u2013 they are masters of\nthe mural.\nIn the past, Sellars has been\ncriticised a number of times for\nstraying too far from the creators\noriginal vision, reinventing the opera\nas his own as opposed to simply\nenhancing themes that already\nexist in the work. However, I don\u2019t\nmind too much and I don\u2019t think\nPurcell would either. In this work,\nSellars has created something truly\nunique, not only a gesamtkunstwerk\nthat incorporates music, singing,\nart, spoken word and ballet, but also,\nunusually, an opera from a female\nperspective, thanks to Aguilar\u2019s\nbeautiful text. I had not realised\nhow alien this idea was, an opera\nabout women, until I actually saw\nthis work; I suddenly realised that\nevery single opera that I had ever\nseen was from the male perspective\nof an event, with female characters\nmerely adding colour to the script. It\nwas shocking, and highlighted to me\nthe underlying sexism that pervades\nmuch of Western art \u2013 thank\ngoodness for Sellars! He has created\na work that is refreshing in every\nsense and is yet another example of\nhis innovation in the field. And we\nmustn\u2019t also forget to acknowledge\nthe ENO in all of this: their tireless\nsupport of operas that break away\nfrom the conventional, even as they\nstruggle for their existence due to\nthe Draconian limitations imposed\non them by Arts Council England,\ndeserves to be celebrated. Lets hope it\nsurvives long enough to put on many\nmore of Sellars works.\nThe Indian Queen is running at the\nEnglish National Opera until 14th\nMarch.\nTickets from \u00a312.\n\"Once\nagain\nshowing\nwhy Sellars\nis one of\nthe most\nhighly\nacclaimed\ndirectors of\nour time\"\n\"They\nimpose\nthemselves\non the\nstage with\nall the\nepicness\nof pre-Columbian\ntemples\"\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

I\u2019m also an ardent\nfeminist, and I\u2019m constantly\nmoaning to anyone who\u2019ll listen\nabout the lack of interesting female\ncharacters in modern literature.\nSo I was more than ready to love\nHarajuku Girls, a new play about three\nwomen growing up in modern day\nTokyo, treading the line between\nempowerment and victimhood\nas they take up work in Tokyo\u2019s\nnotorious red light district. Heck,\nthey even gave me a free pint with\nmy press ticket. When I settled in to\nmy excellent seat at the Finborough\nTheatre, a tiny venue above a pub, I\nwas already glowing with admiration\nfor the whole thing.\nAlas, it was short-lived. It turns\nout that no amount of intelligent\ndirection, clever staging, and\nexcellent scriptwriting can\ncompensate for plain old bad acting.\nAnd I mean painfully bad acting.\nThe opening scene was probably the\nworst. After an incredibly awkward\npause where one actress clearly just\nforgot her lines, the rest of the cast\nseemed to take the entire scene to\nrecover, so I was too busy cringing\nto really gather what was going on.\nI later had a quick flick through the\nscript (another press ticket perk) and\nsure enough, one of the actors had\naccidentally jumped ahead a good\npage and a half of dialogue.\nOnce the cast regained their\nconfidence the quality picked up,\nbut never so much as to be really\nconvincing. Like I said, I\u2019m a\ncommitted feminist, so I don\u2019t say the\nfollowing lightly, but of the five main\ncast members, the three women were\ndefinitely less believable than the two\nmen. Perhaps this was simply because\nthe women had more complex,\ndemanding roles than the two men\ndid - and for that I give immense\ncredit to the scriptwriter, Francis\nTurnly, for writing such interesting\ncharacters - but often the female\nactors seemed somewhat panicked by\nthe immensity of the opportunity,\nand ended up overcompensating,\nrushing through dialogue, or stepping\non each other\u2019s lines.\nThis was particularly true of\nthe main character, Mari, played\nby Haruka Abe, who incidentally\nfeatures as the main role in Clean\nBandit\u2019s \u2018Rather Be\u2019 music video.\nFor the simplest of lines, like\n\u201cyou\u2019re going to be late for work\u201d,\nher emphasis was all wrong in a\nschool-play sort of way, and it only\ngot worse as the script became more\ndemanding. The moment when Mari\ntells her father \u201cI love you but I don\u2019t\neven know you\u201d was over-egged to the\nextent that it simply just highlighted\nthe clich\u00e9 of the sentiment, rather\nthan the subtlety. Meanwhile the\ncharacter Yumi, played by Kunjue Li,\nwas meant to be both innocent and\nsimultaneously painfully self-aware\nof her own low prospects, telling her\nfriends \u201cit\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m stupid\u201d\nand aspiring to work as a lift operator.\nBut she was played with such naivet\u00e9\nthat her complexity of character was\nlost almost completely. (It didn\u2019t help\nthat at one point the director literally\ndressed her in a spotty onesie.)\nIn fact, there were moments\nthroughout the play where I felt that\nthe excellent script was somewhat\nlet down by the nervous actors,\nsince Francis Tunly has managed to\ncreate truly exciting, interesting, and\nbelievable characters with this work.\nAs the three childhood friends grow\nup, their developing relationships\nare portrayed with such an authentic\ncombination of support and jealousy\nthat I was genuinely surprised to find\nout that the scriptwriter was a man.\nThe gradual transition Mari makes\nfrom schoolgirl to sex worker, as\nshe slowly compromises more and\nmore of herself in order to achieve\nher dreams, was written perfectly\nconvincingly; the only slight irony is\nthat Mari\u2019s dream is to go to acting\nschool.\nEven the seedy male characters of\nthe play are well rounded; through\nthe use of increasingly sparing\ndialogue, Tunly convinces you to\nalmost forgive them their creepiness,\nrevealing their humanity. This\nwas especially effective due to the\nimmense talent of Nomo Gakuji,\nwho managed to play both Mari\u2019s\nfather and her client at different\npoints in the performance with such\nconfidence and skill that it didn\u2019t\nquite make me queasy watching it.\nThe staging of the play was also\nnothing short of spectacular,\nespecially given how little space the\ntheatre provides, a testament to what\ncan be achieved when the cast are\nwilling to do some heavy lifting. In a\nbold and incredibly effective decision\nby the director, Jude Christian, the\nmain cast members often switched\ncostume on stage during a scene\nchange, still in character. The\nmoments where Mari was helped\ninto her clothes by her best friend,\nbefore checking her make-up in the\n\u2018mirror\u2019 that was the audience, were\nsome of the most poignant of the\nwhole performance, despite the fact\nthat the walls were moving around\nher and it didn\u2019t quite make sense\nwith the storyline. There\u2019s inevitably\nsomething incredibly character\nrevealing about the way a woman\ntakes her dress off. And the designers\nmanaged to perfectly recreate an\nauthentic Tokyo atmosphere with\ntheir choice of music and props,\nwithout ever over-doing the kawaii\nHello Kitty clich\u00e9.\nBut all this cannot save a play\nwhen the main characters just aren\u2019t\nplayed well enough to convince. It\u2019s\nnot as though I didn\u2019t enjoy myself;\nin fact there was one particularly\ndark scene where I was briefly\ngenuinely terrified \u2013 although come\nto think of it, the moment broke as\nsoon as someone spoke. It was just\nso frustrating to watch a wonderful\nscript with such exciting potential\nbeing wasted by uncomfortable actors\ntalking over each other and overusing\ntheir eyebrows. Perhaps a few nights\nlater in the run, the cast will get over\ntheir nerves and finally deliver. If\nthey do, then perhaps this team will\nfinally have a true gem of a play on\ntheir hands.\nHarajuku Girls is on at the Finborough\nTheatre until 21st\nMarch.

    "content": "68 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nRarely has there been a painter\nwho represents the darkest\nrecesses of humanity more\nskillfully than Spanish artist\nFrancisco Goya. Making his living\nas a court painter for the latter half\nof the 18th\nCentury, it wasn\u2019t until\n1793, whilst recuperating from\na disease that would leave him\npermanently deaf, that he began to\npaint the violently disturbing scenes\nfor which he is best known today.\nSaturn Devouring His Son; The Sleep of\nReason Produces Monsters; the entire\nThe Disasters of War series; all of these\nare deeply unsettling visions of the\nblackness fundamental to human\nnature, and it is for these, more than\nfor his masterful court scenes, that he\nis most celebrated today.\nAs part of his convalescence, he\nbegan painting a series of private\nalbums; these works contained\nneither preparatory sketches nor\na diary of what he saw, but instead\nacted as a record of thoughts,\ndreams, and fantasies \u2013 they were,\nin other words, fundamentally\nprivate. However, whatever qualms\none may have about prying into\nanother\u2019s personal work is swiftly\nquashed by the sheer magnificence\nof The Courtauld Gallery\u2019s latest\nexhibition. In an astonishing feat of\ncuratorial adventuring, Juliet WilsonBareau, one of the world\u2019s leading\nGoya experts, has brought together all\nthe extant drawings from a single one\nof Goya\u2019s albums, presenting it - for\nthe first time - as a complete whole.\nThe result is nothing short of\nmagnificent. The Witches and Old\nWoman Album - not a name chosen\nby Goya, but rather by art historians,\nthanks to its themes and subject\nmatter - is a collection of 22 works of\nwatercolour and ink, whose small size\nbelies the emotional power they hold.\nSome are grotesque, such as Unholy\nunion, in which a grinning figure, clad\nin a flamenco-style dress, carries away\na snake-bound man; others are pitiful,\nlike Can\u2019t go on any longer at the age\nof 98, whose central, ancient figure\nshuffles forward, back bent double,\nsupported by two worn sticks. While\nGoya may not have been particularly\nfavourable in his portrayal of the\nelderly, with a penchant for wizened\ncrones and toothless hags, his work is\nunmistakably humanistic, conveying\nall the joy and misery of life.\nThis duality is reflected in his rising\nand falling figures, a popular feature\nof his work \u2013 in Regozijo (Mirth), two\nfigures are shown suspended on an\nexpanse of white paper, seemingly\nfloating. One figure, who appears\nto be a man, although nothing is\ncertain in these works, stretches his\nGoya\u2019s Grotesques: The Image and the Fury\nFred Fyles is horrified and awed by this display of Goya\u2019s lost album\nRegozijo (Mirth), red chalk and scraping. 237 x 148mm. Francisco Goya\n(1746-1828) Image: Courtauld Gallery\nCantar y Bailar (Singing and dancing), brush and black and grey ink with\nscraping. Francisco Goya (1746-1828) Image: Courtauld Gallery\narms out to his sides, while the other\ngazes up, her legs akimbo and her\nmouth twisted into an exaggerated\nunderbite. They follow the themes\nexplored in his earlier set of prints\nLos Caprichos, a selection of which\nare presented in an anteroom in an\neffort to give historical context which\nis interesting, albeit unnecessary:\nthe Witches and Old Women album is\nstrong enough to stand up on its own.\nGoya\u2019s work in this album\nrepeatedly returns to a number of\nkey themes. Chief among these is\nnightmares: Goya draws a direct link\nbetween dreaming and the grotesque,\nbringing to mind Freud\u2019s saying that\n\u2018dreams are the royal roads to the\nunconscious\u2019. Some, like He wakes up\nkicking and I can hear snoring, directly\nallude to the process of sleeping and\nwaking, while in others the contents\nare so horrific that we have little\nchoice but to conclude - or perhaps\nhope - that they must be the products\nof bad dreams.\nOne such example is Wicked woman,\nwhich truly is the most unsettling\nimage in the whole gallery \u2013 a witch,\nwhose face resembles nothing more\nthan a skull, over which skin seems\nto be merely draped, grasps at a\nbaby, its spine twisted, intent on\nfeasting. These are all nightmares.\nIt is as if Goya were gripped by a\nmalarial fever dream, ink pot in hand,\nconsumed by the desire to record\nhis unholy visions. The blank space\nthat surrounds most of the figures,\nwhich are isolated in the centre of the\npage, only reinforces this off-kilter,\nnightmarish quality, conveying a\nsense of supreme loneliness.\nWhile the paintings themselves are\nmagnificent, what is truly inspiring is\nthe skill with which the curators have\nassembled the pages of the album,\nwhich have been scattered across the\nglobe. Furthermore, expert analysis\nhas allowed the original order to be\ndeciphered, knowledge which had\npreviously been lost thanks to heavy-handed cropping of the images, which\nled to the numbers denoting the\nprogression being removed.\nBerlin, New York, Paris; these\npictures have travelled a long way to\nbe here, and to have them assembled\nin a single room is breathtaking,\nallowing us to take in the full breadth\nof skill on display in Goya\u2019s work.\nWith a deft use of little more than\nblack ink, washes of watercolour, and\na razor, Goya has conjured up some\nof the more profoundly affecting\ndrawings I have had the privilege\nof laying eyes on. A combination\nof the figurative and the abstract,\nthese pictures, which range from\nthe supremely delicate to the\nunapologetically bold, simply cement\nGoya\u2019s already-solid reputation as\na fundamental bridge between the\nromantic and the modern. I am\nthankful to the Courtauld Gallery,\nand particularly to the efforts of\nWilson-Bareau, for assembling the\nWitches and Old Women album, and\nallowing us to experience the full,\nmagnificent, terrifying glory of\nGoya\u2019s darkest visions.\nGoya: The Witches and Old Women\nAlbum is on at The Courtauld Gallery\nuntil 25th\nMay.

I am\ncurrently Computing department\nfirst year student representative. As\na member of union, I want to devote\nmyself to improve the union. So I\nwant to stand for Student Trustee. I\nfully understand the role of Student\nTrustee is to ensure that the Union\nis meeting its aims and objectives,\nsets the long term strategy, ensures\nthat the Union is using its financial\nStudent Trustee\nresources correctly and is financially\nviable and ultimately is acting within\nthe law.\nI belive I would be a good Student\nTrustee, vote for me please!\nps: I am also running for DocSoc\nTreasurer & CGCU Welfare Officer,\nplease have a look and vote for me :)\nYuhang Huang\nI\u2019m sorry.\nI\u2019m not here to make false promises.\nI don\u2019t want to brag about all the\nexperience I have.

Were\nyou consulted regarding the closure\nStudent Trustee\nof Weeks Hall? What about the\nmove of ICSM sports facilities from\nTeddington to Heston? You might\nbe thinking, so what? who cares? You\nshould, my friend!! There\u2019s an absence\nof communication, transparency &\naccountability between our union,\nthe College, and its students - this is a\ncause for concern.\nNow, lets be frank, I\u2019m not\nplaying the blame game here. I\u2019m\nhighlighting the problem - We as\nstudents, have a right to be involved\nin College matters through a Union\nwhich represents our interests. The\nfact of the matter is, we haven\u2019t.\nWhilst this may hindered by those\nindividuals who claim to have no\ninterest in Union proceedings, here\u2019s\nthe solution - Vote for somebody who\ndoes.\nStudent Trustees represent YOU,\nwhen you can\u2019t be there. We fight\nfor your needs, voice your concerns\nZain Rizvi\nand keep your interests at heart.\nVery cheesy, very clich\u00e9 and I\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ve heard it all before, but I\u2019m\nconfident that now is the time we\ntake action, rally together and make a\ndifference.\nVote for Zain, because as you may\nhave heard before:\n#NoZainNoGain\n\n"

I didn\u2019t\neven do A-level English!). And then in\ncome the big dogs \u2013 Times, Guardian,\nTime Out \u2013 effortlessly at ease as if\nthey own the place. Elbow patches,\ngreying hair, weary eyes \u2013 a lifetime\nof experience. How could I possibly\nadd something to this conversation?\nHowever, behind this respectable\nveneer of critical journalism \u2013 the\nglossy fa\u00e7ade \u2013 a less nuanced figure\nemerges. It is not what one would\nexpect. Yes, perhaps pretension still\ninfiltrates their manner, but surely\namongst the top culture critics in\nthe land one would envisage finding\nmore refined conversation than\nwhat I was overhearing; no Kant and\nNietzsche, more Kathy and Nigel.\nIt was fascinating. I had never heard\nanything quite like it \u2013 just wall to\nwall gossiping! It seems only quite\na small clique of reviewers visit all\nof London\u2019s latest shows, whatever\nnewspaper, website or blog they\nmight write for. On the Monday,\nthey\u2019re at the National Theatre for\nthe latest production, the next day\nthe Barbican and the day after that,\nthe Royal Court! I guess they must\nget to know one another pretty well.\nIt is also the perfect networking\nopportunity, surrounded by your\ncounterparts at the rival newspapers,\neach person vying like vultures for\nthe next job opening more senior that\ntheir current one. To get into this\ninner circle where everyone knows\neveryone, and every single part of\ntheir lives, you need to be able to talk\nthe talk and walk the walk.\nThen you have the freelancers, the\nmavericks of the group working only\na few nights a week and charging\ndouble for their reviews. These\nguys are sharply dressed, cocky, and\nusually look at you with an even more\nupturned nose than usual. This is an\nindustry where to survive, you must\neither know the right people or back\nyourself so much that you\u2019re able to\nfake it to make it.\nIt\u2019s the interval, twenty minutes of\nrespite and time for me to reflect on\nwhat happened in the first act over\na acrid glass of the complementary\nchianti. I didn\u2019t particularly like the\nmain actress, she didn\u2019t have the stage\npresence needed for her role. But the\nstage design was br...\n\u201cOh, did you hear about Rachel? I\nheard her and John broke up.\u201d\n\u201cBut they\u2019ve been together for\nyears! Well, I always thought she was\ntoo good for him anyways.\u201d\nIt is one of those freelancers again;\nas I carry on listening, the plot\nthickens even further. It transpires\nthat the freelancer, a very slick, well\nturned out man, has also recently\nbeen made a bachelor of sorts (\u201cIt\u2019s\njust that I\u2019m always too busy flying\nbetween London and New York, it\nwasn\u2019t a sustainable relationship\u201d). As\nsoon as the other man finds out, ever\nso subtly, he starts hitting on him,\ndropping compliments about his new\nhaircut or shoes or making sexual\njokes. It was quite extraordinary. I\nbacked away from the conversation; it\nwas getting too awkward even for me.\nAlongside them, you had the classic\nStatler and Waldorf type art critics,\nhardly able to keep their eyes open,\ncompletely dulled by half a century\nof service. Yes, they may have the\nexperience but how could people like\nthese possible make commentary\nrelevant to today\u2019s world? They could\nhardly see beyond their drooping\neyelids and cataracts. You can\nunderstand why I felt utterly out of\nplace in this whole environment.\nWe may be quite a humble\nproduction, little old Felix tucked\naway in the basement of Beit Quad,\nhowever I am going to argue that we\ndo actually hold quite an important\nrole in the world of art reviews. For\nnot only do we have access to a very\nimportant cohort, the capital\u2019s future\nart consumers, but we also provide\na rare perspectival counterpoint\nto the homogenous and formulaic\npieces much of the country\u2019s press\nis coming out with. Yes, I may not\nbe able to contextualise this piece of\nmeta-theatre in the history of Eastern\nEuropean interpretive dance, but\nthe utility of a fresh set of eyes on a\nproduction cannot be underplayed.\nWe have not been tainted and\ninfluenced to as great an extent by a\nstatus quo, and can provide a much\nmore instinctual review based on our\nviewer experience.\nThat is why it is disappointing\nthat we are either shunned away\nto the worst seats in the house,\nbarely able to even see the stage, or\nsometimes even flat-out refused\npress tickets as a matter of course by\ncertain institutions (*cough* Royal\nOpera House *cough*). Not only\ndoes it harbour poor relations with\nstudents, but it also decreases the art\nhouse\u2019s exposure amongst their most\nimportant demographic, the future.\nSo whilst only the snooty reporters\nwho are becoming part of the\nfurniture, at one with the brocade, are\nbeing invited to press shows, we will\nstill only get one aspect of the artistic\npicture; a picture that is purely\naimed at rich elderly white men, who\nfunnily enough make up the large\nproportion of the critics. And until\nthings change, I shall still be the\nminority, shoved off into the corner,\njust me and my complimentary white\nwine.\nWe are always looking for new\nreviewers.

In 2010, voter\nturnout was at 65%. The over-65\u2019s\ndemographic had an overall turnout\nof 76%. Amongst 18-24 year olds,\nhowever, turnout was only 44% and\nrecent polls indicate that number will\nbe even lower on 7th\nMay.\nThis is a big problem in UK politics,\nand a relatively recent phenomenon,\nwith only a 4% difference in turnout\nbetween the young and old in 1987.\nIn our democracy politicians have to\nfocus their efforts to maximise votes,\nso they will inevitably dangle more\nvoting incentives to the segments of\nthe electorate that are more likely to\nget out and vote.\nWhen you look at the disparity\nin voter turnout between the young\nand the old, it\u2019s no surprise that in\nthis government University tuition\nfees have increased when the welfare\nentitlements of pensioners have\nbeen steadfastly protected. Young\npeople are being disproportionately\nneglected because there aren\u2019t enough\nvotes to persuade those in power to\nshift their focus towards them. The\nsilver vote gets courted while the\nyouth of today get hit hardest. And\nit is a worrying reality that this only\nmakes young people even less likely\nto cast their vote on 7th\nMay.\nThe Shadow Secretary of State for\nJustice, Sadiq Khan, recently summed\nup the situation: \u201cIf you have got a\ncandidate with an hour spare and\na choice to go to an old people\u2019s\nhome or a sixth form college, 99% of\ncampaign managers will say you\u2019ve\ngot to go to an old people\u2019s home.\u201d\nThere is an asymmetry of voting\ninfluence on our representatives and\nit\u2019s only getting worse, with an aging\npopulation and fewer young people\nvoting.\nPolitics is where principle clashes\nwith pragmatism, and young people\nare the victims. And this is simply\ndue to politicians responding to\nincentives. There\u2019s no conspiracy\nhere. No evil plotters behind the\nscenes. But that almost makes the\nsituation even more depressing.\nSo why don\u2019t more 18-24 year\nolds vote? Many reasons have been\nput forward. Some believe that\nyoung people are simply too lazy to\nparticipate in politics. They think\nthat we are too busy texting, taking\npictures of our food and ogling Kim\nKardashian\u2019s arse to look up and\nthink about who runs our country.\nBut this explanation is a lazy\nstereotype and completely untrue.\nIt is abundantly clear that across the\ncountry there are young people who\nare fiercely passionate about social\naction.\nIt could be argued that young\npeople don\u2019t vote because they don\u2019t\nyet feel as though they have a stake\nin wider society, and that it is only\nas a person begins to settle down and\nhave children that they sense that\nthey have a direct interest in issues\nsuch as affordable housing, taxation,\nhealthcare, education, the job market,\ntransport and childcare \u2013 the bread\nand butter subjects of politics.\nOne reason why lots of young\npeople don\u2019t vote is that many of\nthem are not exposed to political\ndiscussion. There is very little, if any,\nformal political education in schools.\nThis means that if a child\u2019s family\ndoes not discuss politics at the dinner\ntable then there is no initial stimulus\nfor that child to even think about it.\nAnd there\u2019s evidence to suggest that\nif people don\u2019t engage in politics early\non, they never will. If this continues\nthen a few decades down the line we\nmight live in a society with a passive\nmajority who don\u2019t vote or even voice\ntheir opinions about the issues that\naffect all of our lives.\nRussell Brand has tapped\ninto the public\u2019s widespread\ndisenfranchisement and frustration\nwith Westminster and the \u2018political\nclass\u2019, and has done a good job of\ndrawing people\u2019s attention to causes\nthat would otherwise be overlooked\nby the mainstream media. But for\nall his well-meaning intentions,\nRussell \u2018fuck-the-system\u2019 Brand\nis not helping the situation when\nhe encourages people not to vote.\nHe talks about bringing down our\ncurrent democracy without offering\na viable alternative and argues that\npeople shouldn\u2019t bother voting until\nhe gets his revolution.\nWhat\u2019s so alarming here is that\nthe people who agree with Russell\nabout not voting are not doing it out\nof apathy, but out of anger. Russell\nundoubtedly has some good points\nto make but in the time between the\nupcoming general election and his\ndesired parliamentary revolt he must\nLeft: Comedian and political activist Russell Brand has been encouraging young people not to vote and has written a book on modern politics titled Revolution.

After all, the\nfirst step in solving a problem is\nrecognising there is one.\nPoliticians could certainly do more\nto bridge the gap between themselves\nand young people, but we can only\nplace so much blame on the media\nand public officials. Now we have to\ndeal with the problem ourselves and\nget young people engaged in political\ndiscourse, because the problem of\nvoter turnout amongst the millennial\ngeneration is self-perpetuating. The\nless young people vote, the more\npoliticians will be able to ignore their\nconcerns without being punished at\nthe ballot box. The less politics has to\noffer young people the less likely they\nare to turn up to polling stations the\nnext time round. It\u2019s a circle, and it\u2019s\nvicious. Which is why they call it that.\nThis May millions of young people\nwill have their first opportunity to\nvote in a general election. There are\n5.6 million 18-24 year olds in the\nUK; that\u2019s 11.3% of the population.\nIf the opportunity is seized, the\nmillennial generation could make a\ndecisive difference in what is a very\ntight race. 18-24 year olds represent\na huge amount of latent political\nleverage that could tip the balance\nstrongly in their favour. Politicians\nwould have no choice but to respond\nby catering better to the needs of this\ndemographic and real change would\nbe made.\nMost young people are not\napathetic. They are angry and\nalienated. We are disproportionately\nignored by the powers that be and\nthose that do vote feel demoralised\nunder this administration, but the\nonly way to change that is for young\npeople to start flocking to polling\nstations en masse.\nTo those people who have problems\nwith the status quo in this country\nbut don\u2019t vote or get organised: you\nhave limited scope to complain.\nBecause, and there\u2019s no easy to way to\nsay this, you are part of the problem.\nDespite what some people say, it\nmatters who is in power. We have\nthe collective ability to decide who\ndetermines the future of the United\nKingdom but if people do not get out\nand vote the government will never\nreceive a proper mandate from the\npeople. The millennial generation\nneeds to vote, for all our sakes.\nYou can register to vote in the\nconstituency of either your home or\nterm-time address. Make sure you\u2019re on\nthe electoral register before the April\n20th\ndeadline.\n\n"

    "content": "64 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nKamil McClelland takes in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse\u2019s atmosphere\nMark Rylance - Long Live The King\nIt is easy to forget how magical\nLondon is at night but as I crossed\nMillenium Bridge to reach the\nGlobe Theatre, perfectly perched\non the riverside, this feeling rushed\nback to me. With St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral\nilluminated behind, I was suspended\nin a state of wonderment as I entered\nthe Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,\nthe Globe\u2019s new indoor theatre space.\nCreated to extend the working life of\nthe open air theatre beyond sunny\nsummer days, the Sam Wanamaker\nPlayhouse is a truly mesmerising\nindoor theatre space, built entirely\nof wood in a late Elizabethan style:\nintimate, hand painted and lit solely\nby candlelight; I have never been\nto a theatre quite like it. However,\nthis did come with a few downsides.\nIt seems there weren\u2019t many people\nwho were 6\u2019 4\u201d in the 17th\ncentury,\nwhich made fitting my knees into\nthe cramped rows a bit of a mission.\nThat, combined with uncomfortable\nbenches, reports of dripping candle\nwax, and poorly positioned columns\nmeant that, although certainly\nauthentic, it wouldn\u2019t be for everyone.\nHaving said that, it was the perfect\nvenue for Claire van Kampen\u2019s\nproduction of Farinelli and the King,\na story about fame and the curative\npower of music. It recounts the tale of\nFarinelli (Sam Crane), an 18th\ncentury\ncastrato, and his relationship with\nthe King Philippe V of Spain (Mark\nRylance). Philippe, disabled by his\ndepression and unwillingness to rule,\nis on the cusp of being kicked out of\noffice by his advisor De la Cuadra\n(Edward Peel). In desperation, the\nqueen Isabella Farnese (Melody\nGrove) travels abroad in search of\nthe famed Farinelli, the best singer\nof the era. Once found, through his\nvoice, Farinelli is able to enliven the\nking from his depressive slumber,\nand each of them learns to rely on the\nother for emotional fulfillment. It is a\ntale of fame, duty and the therapeutic\npower of music.\nIt was my first visit to the\nPlayhouse and it reminded me how\nmuch of the artistic experience\nis lost in large venues, where the\npersonal nature of the art is lost\ndue to your acute awareness of your\nsurroundings: the man coughing\ntwo rows back; the lady flapping her\nprogramme to the left of you. And\nto walk in to live harpsichord music,\nthere is truly nothing that compares!\nThis is true of the music interludes\nthat stud the whole play, disguising\nthe scene changes expertly.\nThis is in fact van Kampen\u2019s debut\nas a playwright, although it seems a\nnatural progression of her previous\nwork as a composer and musical\ndirector. However, this is no ordinary\nplay, as it\u2019s musical components play\nan almost equal role to the spoken\nword, both adding integrally to the\nprogression of the plot. It also just so\nhappens that Rylance, in the title role\nof King Philippe, is van Kampen\u2019s\nhusband. Although some may argue\nthat this seems a bit iffy, all I can\nsay is that the resulting partnership\nbetween them is sublime. Rylance\nfills van Kampen\u2019s characterisation of\nthe King perfectly: charming, hard-headed, and witty, it may in fact be\nthat their close relationship helped\ndevelop the character even more\nfully.\nOne simply cannot fault the acting\nperformances in this production.\nRylance, behind languid eyes and a\ndeep sadness, is delicate and sensitive\nin his humour, and you cannot\nhelp but empathise with him \u2013 an\nunwilling king shunted into a role he\nnever wished to fill. Crane as Farinelli\nis equally witty and charming in his\nsadness, yet has a hardened exterior\nthat comes from the humiliation\nof his castration and his hollow\nfame in the limelight. Best of all is\nthe simply phenomenal countertenor Iestyn Davies, performing the\nsinging roles of the duality of the\nFarinelli character. His performances\nof Handel\u2019s arias, such as the final\n\u2018Lascia ch\u2019io pianga\u2019, are breathtaking.\nNever have I before looked across\nat other audience members, grown\nmen amongst them, mouth agape\nin complete wonderment or eyes\nglazed over by the haunting beauty\nof his notes that float through this\nwooden hall so perfectly. It was a holy\nexperience.\nHowever, this was not simply a case\nof highly talented actors and singers\ncarrying a poor libretto on their\nshoulders; van Kampen has created\na story full of rich philosophical\ndiscussion and oppositions. Through\nthe king, Farinelli is able to largely set\naside his stage persona, a self-division\nvisually portrayed by the dual casting\nof Crane and Davies as Farinelli, both\ndressed identically but each playing\nan opposite aspect of his personality.\nAs well as discussing issues such\nas fame, this play also raises the\nimportance of music in the treatment\nand alleviation of all kinds of\nmental illness, from schizophrenia\nto depression. And just as Farinelli\nis able to dissolve these feelings\nof deep-seated misery in the king,\nmaking him realise once again the\ntranscendent beauty of art and\nnature, he is able to do the same in us\nas his ethereal notes sooth us to our\ncore. And just as Farinelli\u2019s talent, the\nproduct of a lifetime of pain, is able to\nease the King\u2019s ailments, reciprocally\nthe King provides Farinelli with a\nworthy audience, not obsessed with\nsocietal games, completely divorced\nfrom the realities (ironically) of\nupper class life. The King provides\nFarinelli with perspective, showing\nhim that his depression and duality\nis not a unique case, but rather a\ncommonality amongst all people\nin his position, raised to fame and\nfortune by factors beyond their\ncontrol.\nAnd as the chandeliers once again\nrose up, dimming the candlelit\nstage in a subtle changing of mood,\nI was left with the same restorative\nfeeling the King himself experienced,\nthrough the music, singing,\nacting and venue. It was overall\nan extremely worthwhile theatre\nexperience that I would recommend\nto anyone else.\nWell, as long as they are not as tall\nas I am!\nFarinelli and the King is on at the Sam\nWanamaker Playhouse until 7th\nMarch.\nTickets start from \u00a310.\nMark Rylance as King Philippe in Farinelli and the King.

Photo: Laura Hynd\nJack Steadman champions Tom Stoppard\u2019s right to the title\n\"Quarks,\nquasars,\nbig bangs,\nblack holes\n- who gives\na shit?\"\n\"No-one\nout there\nmanages\nquite the\nsame trick.\"\nTo call anyone \u201cBritain\u2019s greatest\nliving playwright\u201d is a bold\nclaim. Competition for the title\nis fierce, and ever-growing \u2013 a simple\nglance at the work coming out of the\nlikes of the Royal Court shows the\nstrength of new talent.\nBut one name has been at the\nforefront of British drama since his\ndebut play, first staged at the 1966\nFringe and promptly picked up and\nproduced at the Old Vic Theatre\n(in its National Theatre days) in\nLondon.\nAfter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\nare Dead!, a re-telling of the events of\nHamlet from the perspective of the\ntitular courtiers, mere bit-parts in the\noriginal, was a storming success, Tom\nStoppard\u2019s name was made virtually\novernight.\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern was \u2013\nis \u2013 an intoxicating blend of dry wit,\nsly re-purposing of existing plotlines,\nand deep metaphysical conversations.\nWith such extensive discussions\ndominating the play\u2019s runtime, it\nruns the risk of being too scientific\n(if such a thing exists), of coming off\ncold and inhuman, but somehow\nmanages to sidestep it all. There\u2019s\na heart pulsing beneath the play,\nand it occasionally rears its head in\nbeautifully eloquent fashion.\nJust take Guildenstern\u2019s final\nspeech:\n\u201cNo\u2026no\u2026not for us, not like that.\nDying is not romantic, and death is\nnot a game which will soon be over.\nDeath is not anything\u2026 death is not.\nIt\u2019s the absence of presence, nothing\nmore. The endless time of never\ncoming back. A gap you can\u2019t see, and\nwhen the wind blows through it, it\nmakes no sound\u2026\u201d\nThat blend of eloquence and\nemotion, warmth and wit is a\ncontinuing trend throughout\nStoppard\u2019s works.\nThe balance varies from play to\nplay \u2013 early play Jumpers (another Old\nVic production in 1972) is designed\nas a farce, and bears the comedy to\nmatch, but also wields philosophical\ndiscussions over morality (\u201cwhat\u2019s so\ngood about Good?\u201d).\nTravesties, which followed two years\nlater courtesy of the RSC, tells the\ntale of a production of The Importance\nof Being Earnest in Zurich during\nthe First World War, featuring\nan eclectic cast of characters that\nincludes James Joyce, Lenin and Dada\nfounder Tristan Tzara. With roots\nin realities, Travesties ends up being\nan examination of art and war, albeit\none riddled with puns and ingenious\nnods to the events of Earnest.\nStoppard\u2019s trend of producing a\nplay every year or two continued\nfrom 1966 through to Hapgood in\n1988, the first play that really felt like\nit failed to strike that balance between\nscience and emotion. Ostensibly a\npiece of spy fiction, Hapgood deals\nin quantum mechanics (not least\nthe uncertainty principle), and\ndoesn\u2019t quite succeed in striking the\nclassical Stoppard notes. Critics (and\naudiences) reacted negatively, and the\nplay never really took off.\nA five-year theatrical silence\nfollowed. Then along came Arcadia.\nSet in an English country house,\nArcadia follows events in 1809\nand 1993 in parallel, using the\ninteractions between its characters\nto explore the very concept of the\npast and how we perceive it, as well\nas the likes of the second law of\nthermodynamics, iterated algorithms\nand the shift in gardening techniques\nacross the centuries.\nIt\u2019s an impossibly complex\nmaelstrom of competing ideas,\nplotted to the nth\ndegree, to the point\nwhere throwaway lines are key plot\npoints. Yet, somehow, it never works\nto the detriment of the play.\nThe sheer chaos of the play\u2019s plot\nsimply serves to demonstrate its\nlarger themes, which the characters\nthemselves are more than happy to\nvocalise. The conflict between science\nand the humanities comes to the fore\nmore than once, with one character\nspurning scientific progress with\nthe gem of a line \u201cquarks, quasars,\nbig bangs, black holes \u2013 who gives a\nshit?\u201d before going on to remark that\n\u201cI\u2019d push the lot of you [scientists]\nover a cliff myself. Except the one in\na wheelchair, I\u2019d lose the sympathy\nvote before people had time to think\nit through.\u201d A serious conversation,\nveiled in comedic insults. Stoppard\nwas back on form.\nArcadia still stands as what is, most\nlikely, Stoppard\u2019s greatest work,\nbut that\u2019s not for lack of trying in\nthe years since. 1997\u2019s The Invention\nof Love, based on the life of A. E.\nHousman (the poet), was equally\nwell acclaimed, while Stoppard\u2019s\nreputation outside the theatre was\ncemented for eternity when he won\nan Academy Award for his screenplay\nwith Marc Norman for Shakespeare\nin Love.\n2002 saw a trilogy of plays, The\nCoast of Utopia, split into Voyage,\nShipwreck, and Salvage, and dealing\nwith events in late 19th\ncentury Russia.\nRunning nine hours in total, the three\nplays opened in quick succession in\nthe National Theatre, winning a Tony\nAward after their Broadway debut\nfour years later.\nAt the same time as The Coast\nof Utopia was earning its Tony,\nStoppard\u2019s next play was opening at\nthe Royal Court. Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll was one\nof Stoppard\u2019s more political plays,\ndealing with the socialist movement\nin Czechoslovakia under the Soviet\nUnion, and rock and roll\u2019s part in that\nmovement.\nThe idea of dissidence through art,\nspecifically against the Communist\nParty of Czechoslovakia, was one\nStoppard dipped into from time\nto time, although Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll is\narguably his largest work to tackle it.\nIt\u2019s here worth noting that Stoppard\nis Czech by birth, although his\nparents fled the country when he was\ntwo during the Nazi invasion.\nAfter Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll, the plays\nstopped.\nThe non-theatrical work\ncontinues to pour out, however,\nwith screenplays for the television\nadaptation of Ford Madox Ford\u2019s\nParade\u2019s End and the film version of\nTolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina, as well as the\nradio play Darkside (another entry in\na long list of Stoppard\u2019s radio plays).\nThen came the announcement of\na new Stoppard for 2015 \u2013 The Hard\nProblem \u2013 which promised to wander\ninto the realms of consciousness. In\ninterviews, Stoppard revealed that the\nsubject had been a long time coming\n\u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t use a computer, so I take\nlots of [newspaper] clippings. Some of\nthe oldest ones date back to the 80s.\u201d\nHe also, being Stoppard, couldn\u2019t\navoid some typical wit. When asked\nwhy he waited so long to publish the\nplay, he remarked \u201cI didn\u2019t wait, I\nprocrastinated.\u201d\nThe Hard Problem shares many\ntraits with Stoppard\u2019s earlier works,\nnot least its delightful blending of\nhighly technical discussions with\ndeft humour and emotion, but\nalso marks a slight shift away. The\nscenes are shorter, and the play runs\nthrough with no interval. It\u2019s all got\nfaster, more reminiscent of a film \u2013\nmaybe Stoppard\u2019s screenplay work\nhas finally started to seep into his\ntheatrical ventures.\nThat\u2019s not a criticism. Far from\nit. Change is always exciting, and\nStoppard pulls off The Hard Problem\nwith aplomb. It\u2019s another successful,\nbrilliant work in a list stretching back\ndecades.\nStoppard\u2019s influence is undeniable\n\u2013 a brief glance at plays such as The\nNether (currently in the West End)\nproves that much \u2013 but there\u2019s still\nno-one out there who matches up.\nNo-one out there manages quick the\nsame trick. Maybe no-one ever will.\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 59\nFELIX 06.03.2015\nFred Fyles on populism, cultural criticism, and Kim Kardashian\nBan Bland: In Defence of Popularity\nPopularity. If the innumerable\nAmerican coming-of-age films\nhave taught us anything, it\u2019s\nthat popularity is a double-edged\nsword; to be popular is to be both\nloved and loathed in equal measure.\nNowhere is this more true than\nin the world of music and film,\nwhere popularity often leads to an\nimmediate critical reaction that\nis completely divorced from the\ncontent itself. The phrase \u201cI liked it\nbefore it was popular\u201d has become\nso ubiquitous as to enter into\ncliche, forming \u2013 alongside listicle,\nhipster, and cereal cafe \u2013 part of our\npost-postmodern cultural lexicon.\nWith the internet ushering in an\nunprecedented era of hype, whereby\nacts can boom and bust in the time\nit takes to get through an episode of\nGirls, as well as a collective hive-mind insatiable in its appetite for\nthink-pieces, our relationship with\npopularity is only going to become\nmore and more complex.\nI am writing in defence of\npopularity. In defence of the idea\nthat something being popular and\nsomething being high quality are\nnot mutually exclusive. Just because\nsomething is liked by many people\nall over the world, it doesn\u2019t make it\nbad \u2013 to me this seems like a simple\nfact, but I have lost count of the\nnumber of times that people willingly\nreject certain aspects of our culture\nbased on how present they are in\nour landscape. Furthermore, their\nattacks never form part of a critical\ndiscourse, but instead act generally\nas proud declarations of ignorance:\n\u2018Beyonce\u2019s new album? Of course I\nhaven\u2019t listened to it. Kanye West\u2019s\nlatest antics? Why should I care?\u2019. The\nphrase \u2018the wise man knows that he\nknows nothing\u2019 may sound good, but\nI fear certain individuals have taken\nit to heart, feeling that their refusal\nto engage in popular culture is an\nadmirable personal trait.\nNow, I am not saying that spending\nall day on TMZ is a better use of\nsomeone\u2019s time than reading Virginia\nWoolf, but both activities are in some\nway educational; your judgement just\ndepends on how you value culture.\nIn an ideal world I would know all\nabout Sartre\u2019s philosophy, the work\nof Marie Curie, and what happened\nbetween Solange and Jay-Z in that\nelevator, but this is impossible; we\nsimply don\u2019t have enough time,\nand knowing everything is an\nimpossibility. However, it is one\nthing to recognise this fact, and\nquite another to actively enjoy not\nknowing something, willingly refuse\nto be clued-in. They are people who\nbelieve that it\u2019s impossible to love\nboth Martin Heidegger and Made In\nChelsea, Taylor Swift and Thelonious\nMonk; in our post-internet age, where\na wealth of culture is available at our\nfingertips, such an attitude is simply\noutdated.\nThat said, I understand such an\nattitude, and sympathise; it is easy\nto convince yourself that refusing\nto engage with the popular is not a\ncharacter defect, but instead makes\nyou a special snowflake. If you\u2019re\nthe kind of person who would rather\nread real books than magazines, who\nwould prefer to be in bed watching\na movie than out at the club, who\nshares be-bop interpretations of\nMeghan Trainor on Facebook with\nthe caption \u201cthis is REAL MUSIC,\ntake me back to the \u201850s!\u201d, then, well,\nunfortunately you\u2019re part of the\nproblem. Looking at the past with\nrose-tinted spectacles, it is easy to feel\nthat back then what was popular was\nalso authentic: Kubrick\u2019s films, the\nGreat American Novel, The Beatles\n\u2013 these were what everyone enjoyed\nback then, right? Well, The Shining\nwas accused of destroying all that\nwas suspenseful in the original novel,\nJames Agee only received acclaim\nfor A Death in the Family following\nhis death in 1955, and the highest\nselling single 1967, the same year\nSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club was\nreleased? \u2018Release Me\u2019 by Engelbert\nHumperdinck. It seems that things\nare no worse today than they ever\nwere.\nI feel that, having come this far, I\nshould include an addendum: I am a\nmassive snob. I am a cultural critic,\nso this is to be expected, and I am\ncompletely proud of my aversion to\ncertain elements of modern life, a\nnumber of which correspond with\nwhat is popular. However, there\nis a key difference: I don\u2019t hate\nthings because they\u2019re popular; I\nhate them because they\u2019re populist.\nThe difference may be subtle, but\nit\u2019s there. While a piece of music,\ntheatre, or prose achieves the title of\npopular simply by being enjoyed by\na large number of people, something\nis populist if it has been specifically\nengineered to appeal to the widest\npossible number of consumers. To\nbe populist is to devalue what art\nmeans, reducing it cynically to a\nmere product \u2013 a sweet pap made\nto appease a broad swath of the\npopulation.\nYes, it is true that there is a\ncrossover between what is populist\nand what is popular; just look as\nSam Smith, who recently won four\nGrammy Awards for his soul-without-Soul \u2013 blandishments for\nthe bland. However, there is a key\ndifference, which we must recognise\nand appreciate. Kim Kardashian, for\nexample, who is perhaps the closest\nwe have to a deity of the digital\nage, is popular, but certainly not\npopulist \u2013 her image may be carefully\ncurated to generate online clicks,\nbut it is certainly not designed to be\nappeasing. Her recent cover of Paper\nMagazine, which \u2018broke the internet\u2019\nthanks to Jean-Paul Goude\u2019s decision\nto cover her derriere in baby oil,\nwas not intended to be inoffensive,\nbut instead to generate controversy,\nsomething it surely achieved. In\ncontrast, Kate Middleton couldn\u2019t\nbe further from Kim K; Middleton\u2019s\npersonal style, which generally\nconsists of various outfits from\nWhistles and Riess, was part of what\nled acclaimed author Hilary Mantel\nto describe her as \u201cdesigned by a\ncommittee and built by craftsmen,\nwith a perfect plastic smile\u201d. In\nthis way, Middleton perfectly\nencapsulates the word populist:\ninoffensive, safe, and boring. It is this\nthat we must fight against \u2013 if I am\ngoing to be a snob, then by God, I\u2019m\ngoing to be the right kind. The only\nother option is boredom.\nKate Middleton\u2019s first official portrait, by Paul Emsely, which was\ndescribed as \u2018pretty ordinary\u2019 Photo: National Portrait Gallery\n\"Popularity\nand high\nquality\nare not\nmutually\nexclusive\nqualities\"\n\"I don\u2019t\nhate things\nbecause\nthey\u2019re\npopular.

Once it shatters, we\ncall their Union straight away, and\ndemand as much money as we\nreckon they have.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes, we even contact\ntheir student newspapers too, to\nreally drive up the student-hating\nhype.

Luckily\nthey enjoy a tad of watersports.\nThis week you decide to run\na paper that is 100 pages\nlong, but forget that you are\nscheduled to have bronchitis\nthat week too.

They\npointed us to their extensive\nexperience as the social secretary\nfor a popular sports team, citing\ntheir many emails to the club\u2019s\nmailing list as proof of their\nladdish credentials.\n\u201cI even got my emails published\nin that rag the college publish, so\nI\u2019m totally internet famous now,\u201d\nthey claimed.\nWhen asked to specify which\nclub they were referring to, the\ncandidate laughed and muttered\nsomething about \u201cballs\u201d before\nrefusing to answer any further\nquestions.\nAfter much coaxing (and a few\npints), they were convinced to\ncontinue. As the conversation\nturned to their opinion on the Big\nElections, the candidate rapidly\nbecame more animated.\u201cIt\u2019s well\neasy to get elected,\u201d they roared.\n\u201cAll you have to do is promise to\nmake eActivities faster and put\nsome waffle about transparency\nand accountability.

The first is\nquite simply to \u201cbring back Lad\nculture\u201d.\nWe ventured a suggestion\nthat this probably wasn\u2019t a valid\nmanifesto point, so the candidate\npromptly emptied their pint over\nour head.\nLured back by the promise of yet\nmore pints and a free Tube ride\n(clothing optional), the candidate\nallowed Hangman to query why\nno-one else ran for the position.\nAt this, the candidate just\nchuckled and beckoned us closer.\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally my fault, actually,\u201d\nthey revealed.\u201cI just started a\nrumour that Kris Kraye was going\nto run for it, and everyone else\nwas too scared to challenge him.

After\na hearty Chinese takeaway dinner,\nsomething of a team tradition, they\nset off for Sheffield ready for the\nupcoming two days of individual\nand team shooting.\nSmallbore is a rifle shooting\ndiscipline that involves a small\ncalibre round (5mm wide by 20mm\nlong) fired over short distances\nbetween 20-100 yards. Indoors it\nis shot over 25 yards. Smallbore\nshooting encapsulates the pure\nmarksmanship aspect of rifle\nshooting, disregarding external\nfactors such as wind, weather and\nlighting conditions, as well as the\nuse of a more controllable firearm\ndue to its reduced power. It is\nthe most popular rifle shooting\ndiscipline owing to its simplicity\nand accessibility, forgoing the need\nof large outdoor ranges. For this\nvery reason, many fullbore rifle\nshooters, those who shoot long\ndistances outdoors, frequently train\nwith smallbore shooting, especially\nduring winter.\nAfter a few hiccups and delays\nwith some of the other teams\n(*cough* ULU *cough*), shooting\ngot underway. The Imperial A team\nled by Laura Stokes, emerged with\nsilver medals on their necks and\nrelief after such stiff competition.\nThis is the highest Imperial has\nplaced in our known competition\nhistory, having come fifth the\nprevious year and fourth the\nyear before. A notable mention\nwas our illustrious club captain,\nJames Badman, who shot both the\nbest and worst score of the team,\n88/100 and 99/100, over consecutive\nrounds, showing that shooting is\njust as much about mental stamina\nas the physical stamina. There\nwere a few competitors from other\nteams who felt the need to show off\ntheir impressive rifles with extra\nlong barrel extensions, perhaps\nto compensate for their lack of\nskill. However that wasn\u2019t the case\nand the competition was tightly\nmatched. The point margin between\n2nd place and 6th place was ten\npoints out of a maximum of 2400.\nThe team won second place by 1\npoint. To put that in perspective, if\none shot out of the forty by any of\nour shooters was off the mark by an\nextra half-millimetre, it would\u2019ve\nknocked the team down to bronze.\nGold ultimately went to\nSouthampton University, winners\nof the title eight times out of\nthe past ten years, also the alma\nmater of one of our best shooters,\npostgraduate medic Lawrie\nGreenfield, owner of the infamous\nall-black \u201cDarth Vader\u201d rifle.\nBUCS competitions are shot as\na league throughout the winter,\nwith the top teams and individual\nshooters progress onto the finals.\nAlso worth mentioning is the fact\nthat the Imperial B team, led by\nGoronwy Tawy, won first place in\nthe BUCS smallbore division 3\nleague bringing back gold medals\nand further motivation to our\nmostly fresher B team.\nImperial College Rifle and Pistol\nClub is one of the oldest societies\nat Imperial College, dating back\nto before the merging of the\nconstituent colleges. As a club, we\noffer every discipline of shooting\nthat is available in this country,\nsmallbore rifle, fullbore rifle, air\npistol and clay pigeon shooting,\nmost of which have corresponding\nOlympic events. We cater to\nICRPC Smallbore A Team Photo: Rifle and Pistol\nshooters of all levels, from those\nwho have never held a firearm\nbefore to national level athletes. In\nfact, our very own A team member,\nAlex Taylor, is on the GB U19\nfullbore rifle team competing in\nSouth Africa this Easter. Our state\nof the art facilities and helpful\ncommunity of shooters mean we\u2019ve\nconsistently had over 150 members,\nmany of which start their lifelong\nshooting passion with us. So if\nyou want to try something new,\nsomething a bit different, why not\ngive it a shot?\nWe can be found by our Facebook\n(rifleandpistol), twitter (ICrifle) and\non the Union website.\nClay Pigeon shooting against LSE Photo: Joe Wilson\n\n"

Yates is an interesting\naddition to the ensemble of conniving\npoliticians and his interactions with\nthe presidential couple give the series\nsome extra momentum and intrigue.\nOne of the greatest issues with House\nof Cards is that the series does not\nattempt to reveal anything about why\nthe Underwoods are so hell bent on\nthe acquisition of power, but Yates\nbegins to ask the questions that the\naudience want to know about.\nThe latest episodes do a better job\nthan the second series of making\neach plot strand equally attention\ngrabbing. Doug\u2019s storyline is more\nstimulating this time round and you\neven take an interest in the guinea\npig wielding cyberterrorist. Despite\nthis, his departure from the show\nwould still be welcome, as to allow\nthe writers can distil House of Cards\ndown to the essence of what we\nreally care about: Frank, Claire, their\nrelationship and the presidency. In\nthat order.\nSpeaking of the relationship\nbetween Frank and Claire, this is the\ncentral theme that this series will\nbe remembered for. The cracks are\nappearing as the pressure of high\noffice takes its toll on the couple and\nthe final episode leaves their delicate\nrelationship on a cliffhanger. There\nis no doubt that this series puts to\nbed one of the biggest issues with the\nprevious two series, which was that\n\"House\nof Cards\nnever\nreveals why\nUnderwood\nis so hell\nbent on\nacquiring\npower\" Francis (Kevin Spacey) and Claire (Robin Wright), in House of Cards. They're probably\nplotting something Photo: AP/Netflix\nFrank seemed to be able to glide over\nall problems with unrealistic ease.\nNow he is noticeably more troubled\nand has met worthy adversaries and\ntruly challenging obstacles. The\nsituation seems much more critical\nthan it did in the first 26 episodes, as\nwe are exposed to the ugly reality of\nthe American Presidency.\nAs with the previous series, there\nis no shortage of \u2018what the fuck?\u2019\nsuperficial shock factor moments that\nHouse of Cards so regularly employed\nduring Frank\u2019s rise to power. These\nshort scenes once again do nothing\nfor the overall storyline and come\nacross as a lazy attempt at character\ndevelopment. Despite this, House of\ncards is nothing if not confident in its\nexecution; the performances are first\nrate and Spacey continues to own his\ncharacter with exacting standards,\nwhile also subtly indicating the\nmonumental strain of high political\noffice.\nThis series marked a change\nin the dynamic, and felt like a\nmore realistic representation of\nWashington politics \u2013 a darker\nWest Wing. Frank\u2019s formidable and\nprincipled democratic opponents\nalso demonstrated an attempt to stop\npainting all politicians with the same\nbrush. Sure, Frank\u2019s evil. Sure, Claire\u2019s\nevil. But not all politicians are that\nmorally bankrupt.\nSeries three is slightly less addictive\nto watch than the first two seasons,\nprobably because the chase is up and\nnow it is about staying in control.\nThere is still plenty of scheming, but\nit is more reactive than proactive.\nNevertheless, series three is another\neleven hours of delicious drama that\ndoesn\u2019t disappoint. It\u2019s a bit of a slow\nburner at first but becomes more nail\nbiting than ever as it crescendos to\nthe peak, with more than a whiff of\nShakespearean tragedy to it.\nThe two previous series set a high\nbar and season three is doing a\nremarkable job when you consider\nthe audacity of the project. After all,\nwhat greater stage is there than the\nOval office?\nHouse of Cards Season 3 is now available\non Netflix\nArch-manipulator Claire Underwood, played by Robin Wright, in Netflix's House of Cards\nPhoto: Netflix\n\"Season\nthree is\nanother\neleven\nhours of\ndelicious\ndrama that\ndoesn't\ndisappoint\"\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 55\nFELIX 06.03.2015\nClara Clark Nevola takes us through the life of Giordano Bruno\n1600: A Year To Go Down in History\nAtenuous numerical link is\nenough to lead us from the\nsignificance of the grand\nhistory of Felix, now its 1600th\nissue,\nto 1600 AD, a year in the life of\nEarly Modern Europe. In dear old\nBlighty, Elizabeth I is on the throne,\nbusily destroying the Armada and\nmaintaining her virginity. Martin\nLuther has aired his doubts on the\nbig guy in the Vatican, and protestant\nreformers are giving Europe a good\nshake-up. The Church\u2019s astronomical\ndogma, already feeling touchy after\nCopernicus going public on the\nwhole sun-centric thing, is further\nchallenged by Tycho Brahe pointing\nout that a new star (the supernova\nSN 1572) had appeared, and that the\ncelestial sphere isn\u2019t so immutable\nafter all. Amidst all this, on the 17th\nof\nFebruary 1600, a man was burned at\nthe stake in a small square in Rome.\nThink of this as an obituary, almost\nhalf a millennium out of date. The\nobituary of a man on the border\nbetween science and religion, a man\nboth heretic and martyr. This is the\nstory of Giordano Bruno.\nThe story starts in 1548, in the town\nof Nola \u2013 then part of the Kingdom\nof Naples \u2013 where Bruno was born.\nHe became a Dominican monk at 17\nin a monastery in Naples, where he\nwas a bit of a performing monkey\nthanks to his outstanding ability to\nmemorise stuff (think Sherlock\u2019s\nmind palace, but better). But he\nwasn\u2019t the top of the class for long.\nForbidden literature was found in his\nloo (a self-annotated copy of Erasmus\u2019\nwriting, not a 16th\ncentury copy of\nNuts magazine) and he developed a\nreputation for supporting free speech\n\u2013 the horror! \u2013 as well as spreading\ncertain non-Catholic views.\nThe Kingdom of Naples wasn\u2019t\na particularly liberal place at the\ntime so Giordano deemed it best\nto leave the monastery and start\ntravelling towards the more liberal\nVenice. From here he wandered\naround for more than a decade,\ncrossing into France, Britain and\nGermany. He taught in Universities;\nvisited monarchs, diplomats, and\nintellectuals; and published a\ngood deal of critical pamphlets on\nphilosophy, religion and astronomy\nthat didn\u2019t make his too popular with\nmany of his contemporaries and\ncolleagues.\nHe eventually returned to Italy\nafter he heard news of a job offer as\nProfessor of Maths at the University\nof Padua. He didn\u2019t get it; Galileo was\nhired instead. I\u2019m sure he got that\nstandard email about how the quality\nof applicants had been very high that\nyear. But career disappointments\nweren\u2019t the only thing coming for\nhim: the Inquisition got wind of his\nviews and decided to crack down.\nA seven year trial, dotted with\nimprisonments, culminated in a\ndeath sentence. He was publically\nburned at the stake in Rome, in\nCampo de\u2019 Fiori, his mouth filled\nwith a wooden block to stop the\npublic hearing his dangerous\nopinions. So that was that.\nEnd of life, end of story. Another\nheretic got rid of. And yet, in many\nways, the story of Giordano Bruno\nstarted in 1600 with his death. The\nInquisition tortured and murdered\npeople for beliefs that we today\nuphold as scientific and liberal.\nThe heretics of yesteryear are the\nsaints of today \u2013 Galileo is a prime\nexample in case. With Giordano\nBruno, the case is not so clear. Both\nhis life choices and his writings put\nhim on an ambiguous boundary\nbetween science and religion: there\nis a lunar crater named after him,\nyet his commemorative statue in\nCampo de\u2019 Fiori shows him in his\nDominican robes. He upheld the\nCopernican view of the universe\nat a time when very few did, and\nwent beyond that to suggest that all\nstarts were suns, each with their own\nplanets around them; he stated that\nthe universe was infinite, without\na centre and containing multiple\nworlds. Is he the forbearer of modern\ncosmological theory and a martyr of\nthe multiverse hypothesis? Should we,\nyoung disciples of a science-centric\natheism, herald him as our patron\nsaint? If you\u2019re nodding vigorously\nand preparing a little shrine for him\nin your room, know that you are not\nalone in your new-found realisation.\nAnd yet, before you buy flights to\nRome to go on a pilgrimage to his\ndeath-site, think on this: Giordano\nBruno probably never carried out an\nastronomical observation in his life.\nYes, he was a proponent of\nCopernicus\u2019 heliocentric theory.\nYes, he wrote a book called On the\nInfinite Universe and Worlds. But\nhis many worlds theory was, above\nall, a pantheistic interpretation of\nthe universe. The scientific theory\nis a metaphor for a philosophical,\nspiritual approach to existence. Had\nhe been a brilliant mathematician\nwho used thorough astronomical\nobservations to formulate a theory\non the existence of other solar\nsystems, chances are that he would\nhave been burned as a heretic none\nthe less, as the Pope was none too\nopen to new ideas concerning the\nuniverse. But Giordano Bruno wasn\u2019t\na scientist by any standard. Is he\na saint for Cosmology? No. Did he\nuphold ideas that questioned the\nrestricted, hemmed in doctrine of\nhis time? Yes. Did he have a lasting\neffect in promoting a philosophy that\nemphasised the centrality of human\nintellect? Also yes. So if you\u2019re buying\nyour tickets for Rome, go ahead\nand count me in, because I\u2019m a fan\ngirl. But let\u2019s remember Giordano\nBruno for who he was and what he\npromoted: the importance of free\nspeech, and the tolerance of views\nbased both on spirituality and insight\nalongside those based on observation\nand measurement. Both have their\nplace in our world.\nThe Statue of Giordano Bruno, Campo dei Fiori, Rome Photo: Creative\nCommons/Remi Jouan\n\"Think of\nthis as an\nobituary,\nalmost\nhalf a\nmillennium\nout of date\"\n\"He upheld\nideas that\nquestioned\nthe\nrestricted\ndoctrine of\nhis time\"\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 9\nFELIX 06.03.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\u2019ve now spent four years studying\nas an undergraduate at Imperial.\nThat feels like a long time \u2013 I\ndon\u2019t really remember the anxious\nteenager who arrived here in 2011,\nwho was unsure of how to organise\na weekly shop and do the laundry.\nI seem to have regressed in my\norganisation of chores, as my life\nhas filled up with report writing,\nproject work and the whole \u2018clubs and\nsocieties\u2019 thing on which I sometimes\nspend more time than my degree.\nI\u2019ve had a great time at Imperial.\nIt\u2019s worked me hard, and caused me\nstress near exams or when coursework\nseems to just pile up on top of me.\nIt\u2019s marked me down for the most\ninauspicious of reasons, and some of\nthe lecturers need to be put back in\nthe 1980s from whence they came \u2013\nbut after all that it\u2019s served me well.\nI think back to the worries I had\nwhen I arrived, the horrors I\u2019d heard\nfrom people back home about coming\nto London. It\u2019ll be too expensive,\nthey\u2019ll make you work too hard,\nthere won\u2019t be any women, it will\nbe full of international students,\nthey\u2019re all Oxbridge rejects \u2013 none of\nthose things have actually come to\nfruition, certainly not as a problem.\nPeople who go on about \u2018the ratio\u2019 are\nprobably boring so it\u2019s an easy way to\nfind out if you\u2019d want to keep talking\nto them. It is expensive, but worth\nit - Imperial\u2019s bursary scheme does a\ngood job of helping those who need\nit, and I\u2019ve loved being able to make\nfriends with people who come from\ncompletely different backgrounds to\nme, all over the globe.\nIt\u2019s bizarre to think how different\nmy life would be now if I had gone\nto a different University. I could\nso easily have not made the grades\nand ended up at Southampton, or\nhad an offer from Cambridge and\nbeen pressured into going there. The\npeople I know now would be carrying\non without me and I\u2019d (hopefully) be\nwith a completely different group of\nfriends, who are now just strangers\nto me.\nBut the biggest thing University\nhas taught me is that it\u2019s about\nthe experience, not just the grade.\nThe difference between a physical\nUniversity and an online course is\nthe people. The academics and staff\nwho help me with my projects, the\nmembers of the clubs I\u2019ve been in\nover the past four years, the lifelong\nconnections.\nThese are the things that are unique\nto University and that Imperial\nsomehow manages to get so very\nright. I learn so much more from\nworking with other people on a\nproject, whether on my course or as\npart of a society, than I do from any\namount of time reading a textbook.\nImperial is always going to be a place of hard work. Photo: Imperial College\nGEORGE BUTCHER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nAs we build up Imperial West,\nmove students to live in North Acton\nand become more ruthless with what\nwe fund and how, we shouldn\u2019t forget\nthis. We somehow need to get clubs\nand societies available to North Acton\nand Imperial West students. We need\nto keep people working together, and\nnot create a two-tier Imperial. The\nUnion needs to play its role in that,\nbut also College needs to recognise\nthe importance of it and help it to\nhappen, or the students there will not\nhave the experience that they deserve.\nYou may or may not have seen\nthat Imperial Hub recently\nran a social action #Resolution\ncampaign. Well, a couple of weeks ago\nwe were all over campus asking people\nto come up with a resolution for how\nthey will contribute to making the\nworld a better place in 2015. On the\nMonday I was running a stall where,\nin exchange for making a resolution,\nwe gave people a free cup of tea or\ncoffee.\nOne guy asked for some examples\nof resolutions that he could make.\nSo I said: \u201cWell it could be about\ncutting your food waste, starting to do\nsome regular volunteering, learning\nabout inequality in Kensington\nand Chelsea...,\u201d which is where he\ninterrupted with a laugh. \u201cWhat do\nyou mean inequality? Between the\nmillionaires and the billionaires?\u201d\nNow you might be thinking, he\u2019s\nright though, isn\u2019t he? Doesn\u2019t every\nother car driving around this place\nseem to be a Lamborghini? About a\nyear ago, before I got involved with\nImperial Hub, I probably would have\nbeen nodding along with you.\nStudying at Imperial, it is easy to\nenter a bubble and not leave until\nyou graduate three years later, when\nyou will probably join a high-paid\ngraduate scheme in the City and enter\nan even bigger bubble. However, once\nyou pop the Imperial bubble you\u2019ll\nquickly realise that your university is\nsituated in a Borough facing some of\nthe most serious challenges and social\ninequalities in London.\nOn one hand you have 45% of\nchildren living in poverty in the four\nmost Northern wards of the Borough,\non the other you have rows of empty\nproperties owned by millionaires.\nThe average income can go from\n\u00a313,500pa to \u00a3100,000pa as you\ncross a road. There is a discrepancy of\neleven years in the life expectancy of\nresidents in the North and South of\nthe Borough. Enough facts? I could\nkeep listing them for quite a while.\nI hope by now I\u2019ve convinced you\nthat there is a problem that needs\nto be addressed; if not, just google,\n\u2018inequality in Kensington and\nChelsea\u2019 for some further reading\nmaterial.\nThe fact is that as a University,\nwe\u2019ve been given a home in a place\nthat we just aren\u2019t giving enough back\nto, a home that frankly deserves a\nwhole lot better than us.\nHow is it that so many young\npeople from all around the world,\nwith amazing skills and experiences,\nFATIMA IFTIKHAR\nIMPERIAL HUB PRESIDENT\nhave come, lived in, and left\nKensington and Chelsea, without even\nknowing about the serious problems\nthat it faces? Students around the\nworld have proved over and over\nagain that they have such amazing\npotential to make a difference in their\nlocal communities, and I know that\nImperial isn\u2019t any different, so why\nisn\u2019t it happening here?\nIs it that students are not curious\nenough about where they live?\nDo they feel they have too high a\nworkload to lift their heads from?\nIs the College not doing enough to\nget students informed and involved;\nthere doesn\u2019t seem to be much on the\nwebsite other than a rather outdated\npage about volunteering? Or do\nstudents just not know where to even\nbegin and get involved?\nWhatever the reason, I think it\u2019s\ntime for each and every one of us to\nstand up, as individuals, and take\nsome responsibility. We all need to\ntake some time to think about how\nwe can use our time at University\nto make a difference to our local\ncommunity. People say University\nwill be some of the best years of your\nlife, and this is your chance to make\nthem some of the most meaningful as\nwell, so don\u2019t let it pass you by.\nGoodbye Imperial, and thanks for having me\nThe Union and College need to keep working together for the future\nIs there inequality in Kensington and Chelsea?\nFatima Iftikhar thinks it\u2019s time that we get involved with our area\n\"What do\nyou mean\ninequality?\nBetween the\nmillionaires\nand the\nbillionaires?\"\n\"Students\naround the\nworld have\nproved over\nand over\nagain that\nthey have\nsuch an\namazing\npotential\nto make a\ndifference\"\n\n"

In short: less sex, more politics\nHouse Of Cards Series 3:\nWorth the wait, worth your\nweekend\nWarning: this review contains spoilers\nAfter a year of waiting, the\nmuch anticipated third series\nof House of Cards has finally\nreared its head. The 13-episode\nseason was uploaded to Netflix at\n08:00 last Friday, and no doubt\nmillions of people decided to spend\ntheir weekends binging on the web\ntelevision.\nThis new series was always going\nto be rather different to the previous\ntwo, because Frank\u2019s position has\nfundamentally changed. Before\nthe end of the last series he was\nconstantly on the offensive, fighting\ntooth and nail to take down Walker\nand snatch the top spot for himself.\nBut now that Frank and Claire have\nachieved what they set out to do, it is\nnow a case of maintaining the power\nand winning popular support with a\nview to the upcoming 2016 election.\nThis new season picks up three\nmonths after Frank\u2019s swearing-in as\npresident, with less than two years\nbefore the next election; since Frank\nwas never voted in by the public it\nwill be an uphill struggle to make\nhis short time in office count so that\nhe has something to present to the\nAmerican electorate come poll time.\nFrank\u2019s big policy is the \u2018America\nWorks\u2019 job programme that will\nspend $500 billion to find jobs for\nevery single able-bodied person in\nthe country.

The politics extends beyond\ndomestic policy and reaches as far as\nRussia and the Middle East. President\nPetrov (Lars Mikkelsen), effectively\na carbon copy of Vladimir Putin,\nmirrors the situation we see today;\nthey discuss actual events such as\nrising Middle East tensions and the\nPussy Riot protests, while creating\na fictional gay rights activist whom\nCarrie is trying to get released in\nRussia.

This might seem like\na small detail, but it makes a real\nimpact in the dialogue. Most of the\nswearing is delivered within a threat\nor in one of Frank\u2019s angrier fourth\nwall breaking monologues.\nIn one tense discussion with\nanother democratic presidential\ncandidate, Frank ends a phone call\nwith this splendid bit of prose: \u201cI\nhave only one thing to say: go fuck\nyourself.\u201d He then turns to the\ncamera and explains \u201cChrist that felt\ngood\u201d.

We\u2019re students; I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019ve heard horror stories of\nflats that have become warzones.\nNow add cultural differences to\nthe mix. Wacky food smells, strange\ncondiments lurking around the\nkitchen, language barriers, they add\nwhole new dimension of things you\u2019ll\nhave to cope with. Worse, racial\nstereotypes aren\u2019t going to help with\nunderstanding each other either.\nOnce you begin labelling another\nperson as \u2018that typical anti-social\nAsian\u2019 or \u2018that noisy Westerner\u2019,\nchances are they\u2019ll stay that way for\nthe rest of your time together. You\nmight have just misunderstood then,\nbut more on that later.\nHere are some of the ways to\nsmooth out the ride with your\ninternational flat mates:\nAddress different\nexpectations\nThis is the easiest way to get to the\nroot of the problem. You\u2019ll have to\nremember that being from different\ncultures means that you have\ndifferent assumptions about how\nthings are done. So sometimes, the\nannoying neatness or messiness of\npeople can be a matter of culture.\nFor example, in Asian countries,\nusually under the guidance of\ndemanding parents, dishes have to\nbe cleaned immediately and the table\ncan\u2019t be messy when you\u2019re done\nusing it. After being enforced enough\ntimes to do that, it often becomes an\nunspoken way of doing things. That\u2019s\nthe origin story for the super-neat\nAsian stereotype.\nMeanwhile, the Western parenting\nmethod is usually more laid back,\nwhere cleaning up can be left\nfor tomorrow morning or later,\ndepending on the home. You can see\nhow the habit would clash against\nhow an international student has\nbeen brought up.\nBeing brought up in Thailand\nmyself, I\u2019ve been through some\nadjusting. I used to live in a flat with\nthree other British students and I\nremember how my flat mates would\nsoak dishes in soapy water for a\nnight before cleaning it up the next\nday. Believe it or not, that\u2019s the first\ntime I\u2019ve seen someone soaking their\ndishes. I thought they were just being\nlazy; I didn\u2019t even know that it was\nthe norm here until I asked them.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt to ask how things\nare normally done where your flat\nmate was originally from. Even if\nthey don\u2019t change their behavior,\nyou can at least understand where\nthey\u2019re coming from which would\nmake it more tolerable or even\nchange your thoughts. Without the\nunderstanding, you\u2019d probably think\nthat they\u2019re doing it to piss you off,\neasily making it a personal thing\nrather than cultural.\nThere is no harm in asking!\nAs students from another culture are\nprobably used to their way of living,\nthey\u2019d probably not notice that their\nlifestyle is bothering anyone else.\nIn this case, a nudge and a friendly\nreminder is usually enough to change\nsomeone\u2019s way of doing things. Much\nbetter than muttering under your\nbreath and gossiping about \u2018that\ngoddamn flat mate\u2019, huh?\nFor example, I used to have some\nsweet-smelling (opinions may vary)\ngreen curry paste in the fridge. Of\ncourse I didn\u2019t notice it since no one\never minded back at home. One day,\nmy flat mates told me that they\u2019ve\nbeen discussing among themselves\nand decided to tell me that the curry\nis stinking out the fridge. I was\nmortified, apologized and quickly\nbought some cling film to cover it up.\nThe curry\u2019s sweet smell is now kept\nall to myself. The problem is solved\npainlessly.\nNo racial stereotyping\nI\u2019ve mentioned this briefly earlier in\nthe article. Why not? That\u2019s because\nit would leave the flat chilly for the\nrest of your time there, widening\nthe chasm between you and the\ninternational students you\u2019ve\nbranded. There would be no chance\nIf you see this in your kitchen, you know there\u2019s an international student (most likely Asian) living with you.\nPhoto: Creative Commons\nChanon Wongsatayanont offers advice on peaceful coexistence\nIf you are concerned about your\nown mental health,or that of a\nloved one,there are people out\nthere you can talk to who can\ngive you advice,or will be there\nto listen.\nHelplines\nIf you are distressed and need\nsomeone to talk to :\nSamaritans (24 hr helpline):\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nWebsite: www.samaritans.org.\nuk\nAnxiety Help :\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 9:30-17:30)\nWebsite: www.anxietyuk.org.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10am-10pm)\nWebsite: www.nopanic.org.uk\nEating Disorders:\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,1.30pm-4:30pm)\nAddiction:\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nWebsite: www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nWebsite: www.ukna.org\nCollege Resources\nStudent Counselling Service\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.uk\nImperial College Health Centre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail: healthcentre@ic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your\nacademic or personal tutor\nregarding pastoral issues,\nespecially if you think your\nmental health might be\naffecting your academic\nperformance.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\nto come to a better understanding\nand your flat mate will remain that\ncaricature for the rest of your time\nthere.\nIt\u2019s kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy.\nFor example, if you think that your\nflat mate is so anti-social that she\nonly hangs out with her international\nfriends, you\u2019re probably going to ignore\nher every time you see her around\nthe flat. Now to her perspective. If she\nthinks that you\u2019re giving her a cold\nshoulder, she\u2019d think that there\u2019s no\none else she can hang out with apart\nfrom her friends from home.

It can also be more rewarding\nthan you thought. You can hear stories\nfrom their hometown that you\u2019d get to\nhear nowhere else.

First,\neach team was tasked with designing\nand building a security device to\nprotect a precious idol on display in a\nmuseum. Sadly, the British Museum\nwere unable to lend us any suitably\nvaluable items from their collection,\nso we went with 3D printed Yoda\nheads instead. At the end of the week\n(with a strict time limit of 3 minutes)\neach team had the chance to steal\nfrom a rival team\u2019s device undetected.\nThe emphasis of the brief was on\ndetection rather than prevention.\nWe wanted there to be no physical\nbarriers to hacking; teams won points\nfor the openness of their design.\nThe more the inner workings of the\ndevices were accessible, the better.\nThe onus was on the participants to\nuse clever electronics as the defence\nmechanism.\nThe event kicked off on Friday\n20th\nFebruary with an open evening\nin the EEE building. Josh Elsdon,\nmulti-talented ICRS Lab Manager\ndetailed the rules to the assembled\nhackers. We then brought out a box\nof pre-purchased parts to get the ideas\nflowing: everything from lasers and\npressure sensors to mirrored acrylic\nand development boards. Next the\ndrinks came out, plus enough pizza to\nwallpaper the entirety of the Business\nSchool. The teams started to take\nshape and the last participants headed\nhome around 21:30, full of new ideas.\nOver the course of the week we\nsourced components for all the teams\u2019\ndevices, including a smoke machine\n(seemed legit). We also ran a midweek\nhack in the ICRS lab for the teams to\nget some help from Josh and Aksat.\nThe Mission Improbable\nFinals!\nSaturday 28th\nFebruary began bright\nand early as the early risers ambled\ninto the ICRS Lab at around 09.30. By\naround 11:00 there was at least one\nmember from each team beavering\naway on their hacks. The last four\nhours were an increasingly frantic\nblur of hurried chatter, laser cutting\nand soldering; with a bacon buttie\nbreakfast break in between.\nJust before the 14:00 deadline our\npanel of judges started to arrive. We\nhad Keith from Aviva with his son\nJames, Shaun from Resin.io, Munir\nfrom Imagination and Imperial\u2019s very\nown Mark Witkowski. With everyone\nassembled, we pried the last of the\nteams from their desks in the ICRS\nlab and headed over to the Skempton\nlecture theatre where the showdown\nwas to take place.\nAmazingly, all 7 teams had\nmanaged to complete their devices.\nThe first half of the afternoon saw\neach team explain the ins and outs\nof their devices and field questions\nboth technical and comical (\u201cIs it\nwaterproof?\u201d). no stone was left\nunturned.\nIt was great to see such a variety\nof systems used in the Hackathon.\n\u2018Team Aether\u2019 went with an elegant\ndesign which fitted the brief perfectly.\nWith fully open electronics, they used\ntheramins to sound the alarm if an\nintruder came too close. Team Force\ncreated a beautifully laser cut triangle\nplinth with strips of mirrored acrylic\nto bounce lasers all around.\n\u2018Team Furry Shoe\u2019 went for a novel\napproach- building their plinth out\nof lego they enclosed their electronics\nin a motorised spinner, thus making\nhacking a difficult prospect! All seven\nteams had interesting and exciting\ndesigns, most of which included\nmultiple layers to the security.\nDrawing from a hat, each team was\nassigned their target device. Over\nlunch the teams grilled one another\nabout the specifics of their devices;\nthe competition rules mandated full\ndisclosure! Some headed to the Pink\nRoom to make widgets to help them\nhack. By 16:30 everyone was ushered\nback into the lecture theatre to begin\nthe hacking phase.\nFor each device we ran through a\nsystem of simple disturbances \u2013 to\nLasers really do make literally everything cooler.

The test\nwas threefold and involved testing\nfor minor vibrations, gusts of air and\ntorch light directed onto the idol.\nAfter a short description of the\nplan of attack, the hack teams had\n3 minutes to steal the Yoda bust\nundetected. The excited crowd\nalternated between raucous noise and\npin drop silence; is there anything\nmore tense than absolute silence\nfollowed by the solitary sound of\nwires being cut?\nOnce all the hacks had been\ncompleted, the judges adjourned to\nmake their decisions. While each\nteam produced a strong entry, the\nwinner chosen was \u2018Team Force\u2019 for\ntheir beautifully realised laser plinth\nplus their successful hack. In second\nplace was \u2018Team Invulnerable\u2019 and in\nthird came \u2018Team MD\u2019. \u2018Team Furry\nShoe\u2019 took the Haribo prize.\nA big thank you to Aviva, Resin.io\nand Imagination for their generous\nsponsorship of the prizes, plus special\nthanks goes to Josh and Aksat from\nICRS for all their hard work in the lab\nand Eifion for his fantastic videos!\nLeft: Competitors assemble to discuss their plans for protecting Master Yoda.

Photo: essentialparent.com\ntreatment, and don\u2019t forget that when\nwe did IVF for the first time, we were\nactually standing on the edge of a\nprecipice: we had no idea for certain\nthat we were going to have a normal\nbaby, although all the experiments\nthat had been done would suggest\nthat.\n\u201cOur lab at Imperial did the first\npre-implantation diagnosis, actually\nbiopsying a cell, taking cells away for\ngenetic analysis. That had never been\ndone before, so, even though we had\ntested it in various animals, again, it\u2019s\na leap in the dark, but you know you\nhad done the best you could.\u201d\nThe decision has generated a huge\namount of media coverage, much\nof which has been focused on the\nethical criticisms levelled by many\nopponents and religious groups.\n\u201cI think the media coverage has\nbeen pretty gentle really,\u201d said\nWinston. \u201cThe \u2018three-parent family\u2019\nlevel was inevitable, and it\u2019s a silly\nlabel, but it\u2019s a convenient piece of\nshorthand. But actually, very few\njournalists produced shock horror,\nand I think journalists talked it up\nbecause they thought it was going to\nbe very big.\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, I think the\nmedia coverage for a huge number\nof scientific things has improved\nmassively in Britain over the last 5-7\nyears. You see it even in the biggest\ncomic of all, the Daily Mail, which\nis classically the one newspaper\nyou would not regard as scientific\njournal: don\u2019t forget that when the\nJapanese nuclear accident happened,\nMike Hanlan, the chief scientific\n\"I think\nthe media\ncoverage\nhas been\npretty\ngentle\"\ncorrespondent of the Mail was very\nmeasured in what he said about\nFukushima. He said this was not a\ncause for abandoning nuclear fission,\nthis was an aberrant response to an\naberrant piece of building, and even\nbeforehand we could have realised\nwe were doing something that was\nprobably not wise.\n\u201cI think actually, Mike Hanlan\u2019s\nresponse in a tabloid newspaper was\nhighly refreshing, and is somewhere\nI think even 10 years ago, we would\nhave had a much more aggressive,\nmuch less measured view. I think\nBritish scientific journalism has\nimproved immeasurably and I think,\nactually, to some extent, that\u2019s had\na knock on effect right through to\nthe sort of journalism that you do in\nFelix.\u201d\n\"I don\u2019t see\nanything\nwrong with\nplaying\nGod.\"\nThe media coverage of the decision\nhas highlighted the important\nrelationshiop between science and\npolitics, and raised questions about\nwhere genetic treatments could lead.\nIn the future, germ-line gene\ntherapy could treat diseases such as\ncystic fibrosis, by replacing faulty\nsegments of nuclear DNA in the\ngenome of a fertilised egg. The\nresearch is at a very early stage at the\nmoment, and concerns over safety\nand ethics are much more profound\nthan for mitochondrial transplants.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be happy with germline gene therapy, because I think\nthe problem with that is that you\nare very likely to have an effect on\nother loci in the genome, which may\nstart to perform differently from\nwhat you expected, because, as we\nknow, upstream and downstream\nof any mutation, there will be other\nsignalling areas of the genome,\nmicro RNAs for example, which may\nactually end up producing something\nwhich is completely unexpected. The\nlikelihood with mitochondria is that,\nbecause their role is so specialised\n(they\u2019re really just concerned with\nenergy metabolism) that it\u2019s a\nreasonable gamble, if you like.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with\nplaying God. To my mind, if you are\nreligious, playing God is what you\nshould do, because actually what I\nbelieve is that if you are playing God\nyou are actually imitating God, using\nyour God-given intelligence to try\nand better the world.\n\u201cThe issue then is not playing God,\nbut trying to supplant God, which\nbecomes much more an issue of how\nyou use wisdom and judgement to\nmake a good choice rather than a bad\nchoice, and I think that\u2019s what we all\ndo as scientists all the time, which\nis a universal concern for all of us at\nImperial College.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing physics, for\ninstance, there\u2019s all sorts of\nimplications, medical physics is a\ngood example, nuclear physics would\nbe another one. There are times when\nphysicists have stood back and said,\nwell actually this may be going in\nthe wrong direction, because we\u2019re\ndoing something which we feel very\nuncomfortable with.\n\u201cSo I think making a wise choice\nis right. Now of course with\nhindsight you could say that perhaps\nOppenheimer, say, made the wrong\nchoice in making the atomic bomb,\nbut of course that was at a time\nof conflict when there were very\ndifferent issues going on.\n\u201cIn peacetime, during the normal\nworkings of a democratic society,\nthat wisdom of how to make the best\nchoice is part of what we have to do\nas scientists: that\u2019s why I think we\nneed to be very much more aware\nof a breadth of knowledge, not just\nknowledge of a narrow area of our\nown discipline, and to my mind,\none of the things we have to do as\nscientists is to keep aware of the broad\nimplications of the work we do.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 45\nFELIX 06.03.2015\ngyrate, in the Nabil-directed video for\n\u2018Two Weeks\u2019.\nIn her most recent video for\n\u2018Pendulum\u2019, possibly the best track\noff her stellar debut record LP1, twigs\nis hung, nearly nude, from a set of\nropes braided from her own hair; a\nworld away from Fifty Shades of Grey,\nthe video is erotic, and sensual, and\njust heartbreakingly beautiful. As she\nslowly unties herself from the bonds\nshe has created, the camera glides\nover her skin, taking in the grooves\nand imprints caused by the tight\nknots, until she is completely free, her\nwaist-length hair flying like a tribute\nto liberation.\nWhat sets twigs\u2019 expression\nof female sexuality apart from\nher contemporaries is the fact\nthat her videos lack a sense of\naspirationalism; they stand on\ntheir own, and are contextualised\nby mental as opposed to material\ndesire. To make a comparison: in\nBeyonce\u2019s video for \u2018Partition\u2019, the\nmost overtly sexual piece from her\nfifth album, and perhaps from her\nentire oeuvre, we are shown a world\nof consumerism and wealth. Sure,\nBeyonce is expressing her sexuality,\nallowing herself to be transformed\ninto an object of desire, but we are\nalso meant to covet other features\nof the video: the manor house with\nextensive grounds, through which a\nlimousine slowly prowls; the bowls\nof fresh fruit at the breakfast table,\npresumably arranged by the high-fashion maid; the wide array of\nluxurious lingerie, most of which is\nencrusted with jewels. In \u2018Partition\u2019,\nBeyonce explicitly presents us with an\narray of objects that scream \u2018wealth\u2019,\nand thereby implicitly makes a\ndirect connection between capitalist\nand sexual desire. In contrast, twigs\u2019\nvideos seem divorced from time and\nspace, instead presenting themselves\nas mere fragments of her overactive\nimagination; for her, the context for\nthe videos is her own mental space,\nas opposed to anything that exists in\nthe physical realm. twigs allows us\nthe opportunity to look inside her\nfantasy world, but not to inhabit it.\nThere is also a key difference in how\nSia and twigs place themselves within\ntheir own songs: twigs takes herself\nas the starting point, creating music\nthat seems as personal and specific as\nsomeone\u2019s diary, whereas Sia tends to\n\"Both\nartists have\ncomplete\ncreative\ncontrol over\nhow they\npresent\nthemselves\" FKA twigs' erotic video for Papi Pacify, from 2013's EP2, which saw her being strangled by a\nmale dancer Photo: YouTube\n\u2013 as her choice of presentation would\nsuggest \u2013 lose herself with a crowd. In\n\u2018Big Girls Cry\u2019, for instance, Sia speaks\nabout her experiences of loneliness\n\u2013 \u201cI come home/on my own...I may\ncry ruining my make up...and I don\u2019t\ncare if I don\u2019t look pretty\u201d \u2013 before\nshe bursts into the chorus, exclaiming\nover crashing drums and icy synths\nhow \u201cbig girls cry when their hearts\nare breaking\u201d. She explicitly aligns\nherself with a general group of people\nwho have gone through similar pain,\nthereby allowing her song to strike\na chord with individuals whilst\nmaintaining a sense of generality.\ntwigs takes a different approach,\nsticking \u2013 almost aggressively \u2013 to\nthe deeply personal. The nature of\nher lyrics make it little surprise that\nthe most commonly used adjective to\ndescribe her music is \u201cintimate\u201d. In\n\u2018Pendulum\u2019, for example, the lyrical\ncloseness is offset by the cavernous\nspaces between beats, which allow\ntwigs to open up to herself, as she\nconfesses the extent to which she\nyearns for another: \u201cI\u2019ve got time\nbut you\u2019re tired of waiting/you only\nwant me in open spaces/come fill\nyour gaps with people/I know no-one\u201d\nshe sighs, in a heartbreaking paean\nto unfulfilled desire. Similarly, in\n\u2018Lights On\u2019, she achingly sings of her\nfear of connections: \u201cI shy away in\nmy mind/in hopes that I could share\nthis place with you...when I trust you\nwe can do it with the lights on\u201d. Is\nshe exploring bodily insecurities she\nexperiences when becoming intimate?\nOr is she despairing at her issues\nwith trust, her inability to reveal her\nsecrets to a confidant? Either way, she\nis treating her music as a confessional,\nbravely whispering her innermost\nfeelings into a microphone. Like Sia,\nshe manages to produce music that\nconnects with many, but looks inward\nas a starting point.\nWhile the two musicians may have\ndiametrically different approaches\nto how they choose to present\nthemselves, what they have in\ncommon is an unbending refusal to\nallow themselves to become a pawn\nin another\u2019s game. They both have\ncomplete creative control over how\nthey present themselves, something\nthat is rare for any woman, let\nalone those in an industry that is as\nobviously sexualised as the music\nbusiness. Speaking in 1982 about how\nher record company had presented\nher in the promotion of her debut LP\nThe Kick Inside, Kate Bush said: \u201cThe\nmedia just promoted me as a female\nbody. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve had to prove that\nI\u2019m an artist in a female body\u201d.\nSadly, it seems that little has\nchanged; women are still presumed\nto be unable to create great music\nwithout having a man behind\nthem, a fact lamented by musician-extraordinaire Bjork in a recent\ninterview with Pitchfork.\nIt is therefore up to trailblazers\nlike Sia and twigs to try and change\nthings. Their approaches towards\nwhat they do with their bodies and\ntheir images are completely different,\nbut that\u2019s ok; in a complex world that\nis getting more and more convoluted\nevery day, it is not my place to say\nwhich approach is better, or even to\ntry and suggest that there is a \u2018better\u2019\napproach. All I can do is be thankful\nthat we have such artists, who will\ngo to any lengths maintain an\nautonomous control over their image,\nthereby protecting their creative\nvisions; it is these visions, these\nvital, meaningful, unapologetically\nconfident visions, that we need most\nright now.\nMaddie Siegler and Sia Furler at the 57th Grammy Awards, held earlier this year Photo:\nKevin Mazuria/Getty Images\n\"It is up to\ntrailblazers\nlike Sia and\ntwigs to try\nand change\nthings in\nthe music\nindustry\"\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

I was\nready to\nreally\nexperience\nthis work\nof art.\"\n\"No detail\nof the\ndense\nmusical\ntexture\nescaped my\nattention\nand its\nrelevance\nwas\nobvious.\"\nHave I just made the stupidest\nmistake of my life?\u201d I\nwondered as the white square\ndissolved in my mouth and passed\ndown my throat. I reassured myself,\nthe whole thing was thought through\nand the plan was bullet proof. I\nstepped out of the bathroom and an\nusher passed a few angry words in\nmy direction. I didn\u2019t hear what she\nsaid, but surely it wasn\u2019t possible that\nshe knew? \u201cThe men\u2019s toilets are over\nthere\u201d she pointed.\nDrugs are a taboo issue so I\u2019ll\nexplain myself. Psychedelic drugs\nalter perception and thought and\nthey\u2019ve been used in spiritual and\nreligious settings for millennia. Some\nof the oldest known cave paintings\ndepict, for example, the connection\nbetween man and mushroom. A study\nat John Hopkins reported that almost\neveryone given psilocybin recounted\nit as one of the most significant\nexperiences of their lives. These\ncompounds are also of great scientific\ninterest and are investigated for their\npotential to break addictions and cure\ndepression, amongst other things.\nHowever, outside of the therapeutic\nsetting, \u2018recreational\u2019 users are\ninterested in their power to enhance\nemotion and facilitate connections in\nthought.\nPsychedelics are tools, and should\nbe used as such \u2013 I believe that before\nusing them, an experience should be\ncurated with a known trajectory and\npredictable effects. For me, one of\nthe most powerful and intellectually\nsatisfying things I can do is to see an\nopera, live. It seemed like a perfect\nexperiment: this opera, one I already\nknow and love and almost 6 hours\nlong, the same duration that the drug\nhas an effect. I felt I could make a\npotent experience even more so, and\nthought that I might be able to read\nbetween the lines. I had read so much\nabout this work, I had played it on\nthe piano, analysed the score. But\nnow I was ready to really experience\nthis work of art. I made my way to\nmy seat, my bag was full of food and\ndrink for the long intervals. All that\nwas left for me to do was sit back and\nenjoy.\nJust as the overture crashed into\nbeing, the drug started to take effect;\nit was pure euphoria, and I was utterly\ncaptivated as the orchestra segued\ninto the first scene. The people on\neither side were forgotten, melting\naway to leave only the action in front\nof me. Everything that happened I\nnoticed, every glance and gesture\nof the singers seemed momentous\nand full of meaning. No detail of\nthe dense musical texture escaped\nmy attention and its relevance to\nthe stage action was obvious. At the\nmoments of greatest power, my knees\ntrembled and became weak. Before\nI knew it, the first act was over but I\nwas still revelling in it.\nAs everyone made their way out to\nthe bar, I stood to let them pass. Was\nI being awkward? It became hard to\ntell, but I glanced at the note I had left\nmyself on my hand \u2014 \u2018nobody knows\nor cares\u2019. It was helpful to remember\nthat no one pays attention to anyone\nelse, and as I looked out into the stalls\nI was amused by the behaviour of\nsome people \u2013 \u201cif that guy can get\naway with doing that then I can get\naway with a lot more\u201d. I sat patiently\ncuttings of conversation falling\nonto my ears. I was overwhelmingly\ncurious but I stayed put. \u201cShit\u201d \u2013 over\nthere, \u201cdo I know that person? Is he\nlooking my way?\u201d I tried to look busy\nand wrote some notes to myself about\nthe opera.\nPeople filtered back into the\nauditorium and the second act began.\nOn stage were two houses; a village\nscene. Beautiful floral patterns\nseemed to me projected onto the\nroofs, swirling and dancing, but\nactually painted, motionless. \u201cRelax\u201d,\nI thought, \u201cEnjoy what you\u2019re seeing\u201d.\nThe plot wound its way onwards,\ntwisting through its tensions\n\u2013 people all wanting the same\nthing, or wanting different things\nand opposing one another. \u201cThe\nHegelian dialectic manifests itself\nin everything!!!\u201d, I scribbled in the\nnext interval. For the first time\nsince learning about the dialectic in\nphilosophy I understood it; it actually\nmade sense to me.\nThe opera was funny as well and\nlaughter was a great feeling, of almost\nabsolute freedom and joy. With the\nchuckle of the man next to me, I felt\nas if we were sharing something great.\nThe act was over too soon and the\nnext interval, 40 minutes long, was\nrife with potential dangers.\nI waited until everyone had left and\nfinished my maddened philosophical\nanalyses. I looked around me. I was\ntripping now, hard, and the shapeless\ninterval stretched out before me as\nan abyss.\nI walked to the bar but there was\nnowhere to sit so I stood, painfully\nawkward. I returned to my seat to\ntuck into the chocolates and drinks\nI had brought. I didn\u2019t feel hungry \u2013\nbut surely my body would be? \u2013 it was\ndifficult to tell, but the timing seemed\nright, and besides, the chocolate\ntasted good.\nA man sat down beside me, I tried\nto continue looking around, but the\ninevitable happened and he spoke\u2026.\nIt surprised me how freely I took part\nin his conversation. As I watched him\nprattle on I felt detached but the right\nresponses simply flowed from my\nmouth. I even fancied myself to be\nwitty at times.\nAs the third act started the man and\nI wished each other a pleasant time.\nI felt that the effect of the drug was\nwearing off, although I wasn\u2019t sure\nat first. I didn\u2019t mind. In fact, I was a\nlittle relieved \u2013 the purgatory of the\ninterval was difficult enough so what\nwould I do when the opera finished?\nStill, I was a small bit disappointed\nthat I might not feel the ecstasy of\nthe finale as I had the overture. As a\nway was found to a happy conclusion,\nI simply enjoyed it as I usually do.\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel that there\nwere some secrets, previously in\nreach, that were now being kept from\nme. It was frustrating \u2013 so much of\nthe experience was wasted on those\ninterminable stretches of interval,\nbut every other moment was pure\nmagic.\nI reminded myself \u2013 it was an\nexperiment after all.\nAbout Yellow, Bridget Riley, 2013-2014, Oil on linen Photo: Bridget Riley\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "28 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nMy Favourite...\nThe Felix Culture Editors tell us about the culture that inspired them\n...Album \u2014 The Shape of Jazz to Come\nKAMIL McCLELLAND\nARTS EDITOR\n1959, probably the most\nimportant year in the history\nof jazz, a turning point away\nfrom bebop and its roots in blues and\ndixieland, towards a new path for\njazz: free jazz. In the same year Miles\nDavis released Kind of Blue and Dave\nBrubeck came out with Time Out, a\nlesser known artist called Ornette\nColeman came out of the shadows to\nrelease his album The Shape of Jazz to\nCome. The implications of this album\ncannot be underplayed; it heralded\nthe advent of free jazz: more a way of\nthinking than a genre in itself, that\nwould revolutionise music for the rest\nof the 20th\nCentury.\nJazz is often seen as either lounge\nmusic or so abrasively complex as to\nmake it effectively unlistenable. The\nShape of Jazz to Come was my gateway\ndrug that took me beyond this\nmisrepresentation. It contains just\nenough of the old school of jazz and\nconventional harmonic structures to\nmake it enjoyable and not completely\nbaffling, whilst simultaneously\nintroducing new musical concepts\nthat completely blow the artform\nwide open. Retrospectively, this\nalbum is by no means free jazz, not\nat all free of the musical shackles\ndefined by jazz and blues standards.\nIn fact, you can certainly hear the\ninfluences from Thelonious Monk\nand Charles Mingus in the album.\nHowever, you cannot doubt how\navant-garde it was at the time, with\nMiles Davis describing Coleman after\nits release as \u201call screwed up inside\u201d.\nYet he was simultaneously described\nas a genius by Leonard Bernstein,\nsuch was the controversy of the\nalbum\u2019s release.\nHow bold a statement to call an\nalbum \u2018The Shape of Jazz to Come\u2019!\nColeman originally wanted to entitle\nit \u2018Focus on Sanity\u2019 but fortunately\njust in time, his producer suggested\nthe name, recognising the album\u2019s\npotential for revolution. It was also\njust in time for Coleman in another\nway. For before this producer,\nNesuhi Ertegun, picked him up, he\nwas considering abandoning music\naltogether and becoming a pastor.\nColeman had always been an\ninnovator as a saxophonist, much\nmore interested in the timbre of the\ninstrument as opposed to playing\nthe \u2018correct\u2019 notes. In fact in 1954 he\nstarted playing a plastic saxophone,\nunable to afford a metal one, giving\nhis playing an extremely unique\nsound that is a lot drier and more\npiercing than other saxophonists.\nHowever, whilst his work can\nsometimes be quite affronting, it is\nalso some of the most emotionally\nrich and complex that I have ever\ncome across. From a hyena-like\ncackle to a lamenting weep, he\ntruly encompasses the beauty of\ndissonance. Harmony is unimportant\nto him, emotion through melody and\ntimbre are what counts, embracing\na raw energy rarely seen in any jazz\nartists before him. He also did not\nview pitch in the same way as his\nartistic counterparts. He appreciated\nit was a spectrum and made use of\nmicrotones like no other, insisting\nthe same pitch should sound different\nat each performance depending on\nthe context and mood. It was truly\nrevolutionary thinking!\nAnd this is why I love this album\nso much, the work of a maverick\ninnovator miles ahead of the curve \u2013\ntruly the shape of jazz to come.\n...Author \u2014 Margaret Atwood\nFRED FYLES\nARTS EDITOR\nThe first book that I can\nremember being upset at\nfinishing, not just sad, but\nactually physically hurt, was Margaret\nAtwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. A\nstory of a future in which radical\nChristians have transformed America\ninto a theocracy, and the declining\nfertility rate has led to the remaining\nfecund women being enslaved as\n\u2018handmaids\u2019, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\nkick-started in this prepubescent boy\na love of dystopian fiction; 1984, Brave\nNew World, We, these all followed\nin rapid succession, but none could\nmatch the joy I felt when reading\nAtwood\u2019s carefully crafted prose.\nLuckily, I found a fellow confidante\nin my mother: a big fan of Atwood,\nher collection stood proud on our\nbookshelves, their green spines and\nbitten apple logo indicating that they\nwere printed by feminist publishers\nVirago Press. And so I gorged. Gorged\nmyself on cannibalistic rituals\ninvolving women made of cake; on\nthemes of Canadian nationalism\nand a return to nature; on the inner\nthought of artists, and writers, and\npaleontologists, and students, all\nbrought to life thanks to Atwood\u2019s\ndeft wit. Reading Atwood\u2019s novels,\nso many of them are concerned\nwith rural Canada, a dichotomous\nenvironment of majesty and fury,\nbeauty and pain. They made me yearn\nfor a country I have never visited yet\ncould clearly picture, for a place that\ncould not be more different from my\nNorth London living room but which\nstill seemed familiar.\nHer body of work is enormous,\nnot only in scope but volume too:\nfourteen novels; fifteen books of\npoetry; nine short story collections;\nthree libretti; the list goes on. Her\nnovels wilfully defy categorisation.\nWhen people started saying that she\nwas a feminist writer, she politely\ncorrected them: \u201cThe Edible Woman,\n[Atwood\u2019s first novel] is protofeminist\nrather than feminist: there was no\nwomen\u2019s movement in sight when\nI was composing the book in 1965...\nthough like many at the time I\u2019d\nread Betty Friedan and Simone\nde Beauvoir behind closed doors\u201d.\nInstead of giving her Oryx and Crake\ntrilogy the moniker of science-fiction,\nshe instead calls them speculative\nfiction, telling us in no uncertain\nterms that there are \u201cno martians\u201d.\nThis slipperiness, this struggle against\nconformity, which has continued\nthroughout a career that has entered\nits fifth decade, is what sets her work\napart, lifting her higher than any\nwriter currently working\nSometimes, if I am feeling down,\nI get up a picture of her on my\ncomputer screen; she\u2019s the only\nperson I know in whose physical\nfeatures genius is manifestly evident.\nIt\u2019s there, in her eyes. A glimmer. A\ngleam. And in her mouth too, the way\nher lips curl slightly upwards at the\nends, as if constantly laughing at her\nown private joke.\nThey give an indication, a\nsuggestion, of a mind at work; a\nmind that\u2019s constantly ticking over,\nscheming, laying out plans, keeping\nitself busy. A mind for which we\nshould be thankful. A mind that\nmakes the world so much bigger than\nI can possibly imagine.\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "44 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nFred Fyles compares the different approaches FKA twigs and Sia take\nwhen it comes to their controlling their public image in music videos\nFKA twigs, Feminism, and\nFemale Sexuality on Video\nLast month, in her debut at\nLondon\u2019s Roundhouse, British\nauteur FKA twigs brought her\nunique vision to a crowd of 3,000.\nEntitled Congregata, a latin word for\n\u2018gathering\u2019, the two hour spectacle\nsaw twigs put her indomitable singing\nand dancing talents to good use; she\nvogued alongside a dancer in fishnet\nstockings, was tossed up in the air\nby burly men with topknots, and\nchanged outfits whilst contortionists\nkept the crowd entertained. It\u2019s a far\ncry from her London debut, which\ntook place at Hoxton\u2019s Courtyard\nTheatre, a little less than a year ago,\nin front of an audience of just over\n100. While at the Roundhouse she\nwas front and centre, at the Courtyard\nshe was kept shielded from the\naudience by a swirling mist, through\nwhich you could make out the petite\nfigure who has become one of the\nmost important voices in the British\nmusic industry. What was kept\nconstant between the gigs, however,\nwas her sheer gratitude at being able\nto perform; at the end of Congregata,\ntwigs breaks character, telling the\naudience in a breathy voice that can\nbarely contain its excitement how\nhappy she is to be there. As if any\nother outcome were possible.\nAs twigs has become more and\nmore popular, her presence in our\nvisual landscape has become nearly\ninescapable; if you don\u2019t spot her\nstaring you down on the Summer\n2014 issue of Dazed Magazine,\nher backcombed hair making her\nlook like she\u2019s been plugged into\nan electrical socket, you\u2019ll see\nher looking out at you on a tube\nadvert, a crimson mark covering,\nlike some form of stigmata, a face\nphotoshopped to look like porcelain.\nOf course, with her relationship\nwith Robert Pattinson nearing the\n6-month mark, you are even sure\nto find her gracing the Daily Mail\u2019s\n\u2018Sidebar of Shame\u2019 every now and\nthen.\nWhile such visibility seems\nnear-inevitable in our social media,\ninstagram-as-verb, post-panoptic\nworld, Australian singer Sia has\nmanaged to take a different approach;\nwhile acknowledging that promoting\nher sixth album 1000 Forms of Fear\nnecessitates the required media\ncircuit of performances, photoshoots,\nand interviews, she has remained\nwilfully \u2013 and delightfully \u2013 obtuse in\nhow she chooses to present herself. In\nwhat could be described as a publicity\nstunt, but really deserves the title\nof performance art, Sia has refused\nto show her face whilst performing\nfor the last year. Instead, she has\nput the spotlight on Maddie Siegler,\na 12-year-old dance prodigy from\nthe TV series Dance Moms; Siegler\ntakes centre stage alongside a range\nof celebrity cameos, from Lena\nDunham to Kristen Wiig, while Sia\nturns away from the audience, her\nshoulderblades shuddering as she\nexercises her fearsome vocals. Like\nanything on the internet, if you want\nto see her face that much you can\ngoogle it, but Sia\u2019s damn sure not\ngoing to present herself up to you\nwillingly.\nSiegler has become some sort of\nan avatar for Sia, the precocious\npreteen presented as a public face\nfor Sia\u2019s music. In the video for\n\u2018Chandelier\u2019, Siegler flings herself\naround a dilapidated apartment,\ntwisting and contorting her face into\n\"While such\nvisibility\nseems near-inevitable,\nsinger\nSia has\nmanaged a\ndifferent\napproach\"\nFKA twigs looking bug-eyed in her video for Water Me, from 2013's EP2 Photo: YouTube\nThe steamy, sensual video for FKA twigs' Two Weeks, from 2014's LP1 Photo: YouTube\ngruesome configurations, while in\n\u2018Elastic Heart\u2019 she dance-fights with\nShia LaBeouf in a giant cage. Instead\nof presenting herself as a visual\nobject, Sia subverts the audience\u2019s\nexpectation, delivering instead a\npiece of carefully choreographed\nperformance art. What makes her\ndecision \u2013 prompted, she says, by a\ndesire \u201cto not be famous\u201d \u2013 all the\nmore interesting is the fact that for all\nprevious albums she has done she has\nshown her face quite willingly. You\nonly have to go about halfway down\nthe first page of YouTube results that\npop up when you search \u2018Sia\u2019 to find\nher face: a video of a 2007 SXSW\nperformance in which she addresses\nthe audience head on, telling them\nin an excited voice that they were\n\u201cradical\u201d. So what changed? Perhaps\nthe songwriting interval between her\nfifth and sixth albums, during which\ntime she penned \u2018Pretty Hurts\u2019 for\nBeyonce and \u2018Diamonds\u2019 for Rihanna,\ngave her the opportunity to get used\nto eschewing the limelight.\nIn terms of music videos, twigs\nseems to stand in direct contradiction\nto Sia; while Sia\u2019s rise to fame has\nled to her shielding herself from\nthe public, as twigs has become\nincreasingly popular, she has chosen\nto reveal herself more and more. In\n\u2018Hide\u2019, for example, one of the first\nsingles from her excellent debut EP1,\nshe is only visible from shoulders to\nknees; wiggling around to the beat\nof the song, she tenderly caresses\nan anthurium, clasped between her\nthighs, whose phallic spadix thrusts\nupwards. Even when she first decided\nto reveal herself to the world, she\nused technical trickery to add an\nuncanny valley element to her image;\non the cover of EP2, her neck is\nsubtly lengthened, and in the video\nfor \u2018Water Me\u2019, the lead single from\nthat release, twigs\u2019 already wide eyes\nare enlarged, until she resembles\nsomething not-quite human.\nAs time has gone on, it seems that\ntwigs has become more comfortable\nwith revealing herself: covered\nin glitter, she is simultaneously\nstrangled and caressed in her video\nfor \u2018Papi Pacify\u2019; sitting upon a\nthrone like an ancient Egyptian\ngoddess, she is surrounded by an\narmy of mini-twigs who krump and\n\"FKA twigs'\nvideo for\nPendulum\nis erotic,\nsensual, and\nachingly\nbeautiful\"\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "38 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nJoshua Renken offers a\nfinal retrospective on this\nlong-running medical\ndrama\nHouse:\nA PostMortem\nIf you have never watched House,\nI envy you. It is one of the most\nnuanced and intelligent shows\never created, and there are 177\nepisodes for you to enjoy for the first\ntime. In the eight years that House\nran (2004-2012) it was distributed to\nover 60 countries and at one point\nhad the highest worldwide viewing\nfigures of any television series. While\nthe idea of a new medical show\nfor Fox network originated with\nPaul Attanasio, it was David Shore,\ncredited as creator, who conceived the\ntitular character that made the series\nso captivating.\nThe series centres on the life of\nDr. Gregory House: a misanthrope if\never there were one. House is a drug\naddict who depends on Vicodin pills\nto manage the pain caused by an\ninfarction in his quadriceps muscle\nfive years prior. His reputation as\nsomething of a medical genius carries\nweight at Princeton Plainsboro\nTeaching Hospital, an institution\nheaded by Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa\nEdelstein). Leading a team of elite\ndiagnosticians at PPTH, House takes\non the cases that other doctors have\nnot been able to solve, in an attempt\nto \u201cdiagnose the undiagnosable.\u201d\nAt the beginning of the show his\nteam consists of Dr. Chase (Jesse\nSpencer), Dr. Foreman (Omar Epps)\nand Dr. Cameron (Jennifer Morrison),\nbut the composition of his diagnostic\nteam undergoes several changes. This\nchopping and changing of characters\nkept the series fresh in the fifth and\nsixth series, a point at which many\nshows begin to think about finales.\nBut really this show is all about\nHouse. The team primarily serve to\ncreate talking points for our troubled\nprotagonist, who regularly probes\ninto their personal lives in an attempt\nto understand his employees better;\nvery attentive when it comes to the\nbehaviour of his team, there is rarely\nsomething he misses. House expends\na huge amount of energy avoiding his\nresponsibilities as a doctor, so he has\ntime spare to mull over the patient\u2019s\ncondition (they work case-by-case),\ngossip with Wilson about Cuddy and\ninvestigate into the private lives of\nhis team. A stubborn and principled\nman who thrives on conflict, he\nbelieves that his employees will\nwork best in a chaotic environment\nwhere they are constantly trying to\noutdo one another. With each batch\nof employees he quickly creates a\ncompetitive environment and under\nHouse\u2019s tutelage his fellow physicians\nlearn to distrust what their patients\nsay. He encourages them to stand up\nfor what they believe and fight for\ntheir ideas. The team bend the rules\nif they feel that it is not in the best\ninterests of the patient and often\nbreak into the patient\u2019s home without\npermission. Perhaps unsurprisingly,\nHouse\u2019s favourite mantra is\n\u201ceverybody lies\u201d.\nEach week there is a new case, which\nHouse typically solves after a few\nerroneous diagnoses, but the team\nscrew up regularly enough to keep\nyou guessing. It is explained in the\npilot episode that House is one of the\nbest in the country at finding medical\n\u2018zebras\u2019 when other doctors are\nlooking for \u2018horses\u2019. He has a knack\nfor solving obscure medical puzzles\nthat most other doctors could not.\nHouse is a series that regularly deals\nwith contentious issues including\nrape, abortion, religion, faith, and\nadultery. The momentum of the show\nstems from the intriguing cases which\nprovide a bottomless source of ethical\ndilemmas and thought provoking\ntopics for the characters to debate.\nDr. House frequently reaches\nan epiphany when in entertaining\nconversation with his confidant\nand only friend Dr. James Wilson\n(Robert Sean Leonard). Wilson is the\nHead of Oncology at the hospital,\nand acts as a sounding board for\nHouse to bounce ideas off; in many\nways he is House\u2019s conscience. House\nrelentlessly mocks Wilson for caring\nso much about the people he treats,\nin one episode knocking on Wilson\u2019s\ndoor and declaring, \u201cI know you\u2019re\nin there. I can hear you caring.\u201d It is\nmentioned that Wilson has a Messiah\ncomplex; if true, then in contrast\nHouse has the Rubik\u2019s complex. He\njust wants to solve the puzzle. Highly\nmanipulative in his relationships,\nHouse often tests those around him\nto find their breaking points. He loves\nto play mind games with Wilson, and\nthe duo often prank one another,\noften escalating until Cuddy has to\nintervene.\nHouse is a deeply depressed\ncharacter with a very cynical outlook\non life; for all his existence he has\nbeen an antisocial maverick genius\nwho struggles to connect with people.\nWith a penchant for medical puzzles,\nplaying the piano, Vicodin, alcohol,\nand hookers, House is simultaneously\nimmature yet perceptive in his\nconclusions about life. He reacts\non impulses and is only selectively\nrational. He strongly believes that\npeople are purely self-interested,\nthat everybody lies, that religion is a\njoke and that thoughts don\u2019t matter.\nOnly actions. He thinks there is no\nobjective purpose to life and dismisses\nthe lives he saves. It is through his\nsolving of medical puzzles that he\nattempts to find deeper meaning, but\nhe describes the lives he saves as \u201cjust\ncollateral damage.\u201d\nThis series gets darker as House\u2019s\nbehaviour becomes more extreme.\nHe is always unstable and the people\nclosest to him, Wilson and Cuddy,\nare in constant fear that he will go\noff the rails. They try to provide an\natmosphere where House is given\nenough freedom to do his best work as\na doctor, but not so much that he kills\n\"House was\none of the\nfirst series\nto put an\nanti-hero\nas the main\nprotagonist\"\nThe cast of Season 4 of House Photo: FOX\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\nHugh Laurie, who stars as the title star in the long-running serie\nPhoto: FOX\n\n"

I am a running for\ncouncil chair because I have a passion\nto help others and aspire to make a\ndifference to university life.\nI have an excellent track record\nof success, achievement and\ndetermination to be the best.\nI have demonstrated these traits\nboth academically and outside of my\nstudies: I am currently ESE 3rd\nyear\nrepresentative, as well as being the\nformer assistant station manager\nof ICV and secretary of the Media\ngroup. Other past experiences include\nbeing a vital member of a disability\ncouncillor team at an American\nsummer camp, and 15 years as master\nof ceremonies at my local parish.\nThese all emphasise my confident\nleadership, commitment, flexibility,\nresponsibility, ability to be a crucial\nteam player, and ability to thrive in\nnew situations.\nI am confident I can make an\ninstant impact in this role and will\nensure that each policy brought\nforward are considered in depth and\nevery voice listened to. I will ensure\nthat the executive branch are held\naccountable at all times and that they\nfulfil their election promises.\nI accept the challenges that this\nrole will require me to face, and will\nact accordingly and to the best of my\nability for the best of the union.\nAs an RSM member I know what\nchange and progress looks like. I\nbelieve this gives me an edge to lead\nthis council successfully into the\nfuture.\nCouncil Chair Jasper Menkus\nSince the beginning of this\nacademic year, I have served on\nCouncil as an Ordinary Member.\nYou may not know much about\nCouncil, but its proceedings affect\nall of you who are reading this. So\nfar this year, we have set the rent\nratio between Acton and South Ken\nhalls, reduced the price of feminine\nhygiene supplies in the Union shop,\nkept the sabbatical officers in line,\nand changed our own voting rules to\nmake Council more transparent.\nWe have also formulated \u2018official\u2019\nUnion positions on issues as diverse\nas tuition fees, the Counterterrorism\nand Security Bill, fossil fuel\ndivestment and ethical investment,\npostgraduate experience, and bursary\nfunding. Many of these proposals\nwere brought to Council not by Sabbs\nor Council members, but by ordinary\nstudents.\nAt the heart of an effective Council\nis an efficient and impartial Chair:\nsomeone who is familiar with the\nUnion ecosystem, someone who\nwants to ensure that everybody has\ntheir voice heard. I believe that I am\nthat person. From two years serving\non various committees (and two\nterms on Council) I have the skills\nand experience necessary to navigate\nthe turbid bureaucratic waters of\nthe Union, and the commitment to\nensure that Council reaches its full\npotential next year.\nIf elected, I will encourage a\ngreater variety of students to\nsubmit papers to Council. I will also\nstrive to improve communication\nbetween Council members and the\ncommunities that they represent,\nwhich has been lacking of late.\nVote experience. Vote dedication.\nVote Menkus.\nCouncil Chair Richard Cameron\nI have been involved with the\nUnion for 4 years now (first as an\nundergrad, and now doing my PhD in\nthe Physics department). I currently\nsit on the Union Council and chair\nthe Recreational Clubs Committee, a\ngroup of around 45 clubs & societies\nin the Union with over 2,600\nmembers.\nThis requires me to help with the\nrunning of RCC clubs and to liaise\nbetween them and the Union, as well\nas chairing regular meetings of the\nRCC to keep the clubs up to date with\nhappenings in the Union.\nIn addition, this role has required\nme to sit on both the Union Council\nand the Clubs, Societies, & Projects\nBoard \u2013 the panel governing all clubs\nat Imperial \u2013 as well as a variety of\nother Union and College committees.\nWhile Council is quite removed\nfrom the student-facing side of the\nUnion, it makes many of the most\nimportant decisions for the student\nbody, from overseeing the sabbatical\nofficers to even setting rents in halls\nnext year. As the Council Chair also\nsits on the Union\u2019s Board of Trustees,\ntaking on this position is a huge\nresponsibility.\nHaving experience of chairing a\nlarge group within the Union, as\nwell as experience on Council itself, I\nbelieve I would perform this role well.\nIf elected, I would simply promise\nto chair Council meetings impartially\nand responsibly, for the benefit of\nstudents, and to welcome input from\nacross the student body in my role as\na Trustee for the Union.\nWe\u2019ve interviewed many\nof the candidates too!

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 35\nFELIX 06.03.2015\nfty years of projection, film, and sound in the cinema industry\nThe History of Projection\nneed to be reloaded. This was quickly\ntaken up by the public, and remains\na very popular medium for amateur\nfilmmakers. It is usually converted\nfrom film to video to be more easily\nworked with, a process known as\ntelecine.\nThe soundtrack was still mostly\nsound-on-disk at this time,\nbeing played on separately on a\nphonograph at the same time at the\nfilm played.The first method to put\nthe soundtrack directly on the film\nwas phonofilm, which was patented\nin 1919. This recorded sound directly\nonto the film from a microphone as\na series of parallel lines. This would\nthen be turned back into sound at\nthe other end this. It was mostly used\nto film musical numbers, especially\nopera singers, and political speeches.\nThough the sound quality improved\nover the years, it could never match\nthe quality of the sound-on-disk\nsystems and was no longer used by\n1929.\nDisney, in association with RCA\nRecords, also attempted to create\na sound-on-film system for called\nFantasound for the original release\nof Fantasia in 1940, which had a\nmulti-channel soundtrack recorded\non a separate strip of film. This never\nreally took off as many cinemas did\nnot pay the expense to update their\nequipment. This meant that not\nmany cinemas could play Fantasia as\noriginally intended, and is thought\nto be a large contributing factor in\nFantasia\u2019s poor original run.\nThe earliest films were all in\nblack-and-white, but in 1906 the first\ncolour process was developed. Known\nas Kinemacolor, it used commercially\nfrom 1908-14 and worked by\nphotographing and projecting\na black-and-white film behind\nalternating red and green filters. The\nsecond commercially process was\nthe very widely used Technicolor,\nwhich was used to develop films in\nHollywood until 1952. It\u2019s distinctive\nsaturated colouring was found in\nsuch classics as the Wizard of Oz and\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarves.\nA large problem with many film\nprints throughout the twentieth\ncentury is what is commonly known\nas \u201cvinegaring\u201d. When films are\nstored in humid conditions the\nacetate turns into acetic acid causing\nit to turn brown and become brittle;\nnot only does this mean the film can\nno longer be played, it also degrades\nthe image quality mean the film can\nno longer be copied either. This has\ncaused the loss of many film prints as\nit an irreversible process, and led to\nthe development of cellulose nitrate\nand other film types throughout the\nlate twentieth and early twenty first\ncenturies.\nSound-on-film, based on the\nAcademy optical system, worked\nby having an audio signal as two\nlines running parallel with the film.\nThe lines grow thinner or wider\ndepending on the magnitude of the\nsignal. A light shined from a lamp\ncalled an exciter is passed through\nthe film, and the intensity is detected\nby a photosensitive element which\nis then turned into sound. This\nwas originally black-and-white,\nbut due to the pigments being\nenvironmentally unfriendly this was\nswitched to a cyan dye in the early\ntwenty first century. As cyan dyes do\nnot let infra-red light through, the\nexciter was switched to a red coloured\nLED or laser, which are backwards\ncompatible with earlier prints. The\nAcademy optical system suffered\nfrom somewhat poor audio fidelity.\nThis problem was solved in 1975 with\nthe introduction of Dolby Stereo, a\nsystem that was widely adopted by\ncinemas world-wide and used with\nStar Wars and Close Encounters of the\nThird Kind in 1977. Dolby Stereo was\nsupplanted by the Dolby Digital AC-3\nformat and the first film to use the\nsystem was Batman Returns in 1992.\nIn 2002, newly produced digital\nprojectors were tried out in cinemas.\nThese had issues with pixelisation in\nsome scenes. By 2006, this had been\nsolved, and the projectors themselves\nbecame much smaller. Only a couple\nof years later cinemas began to make\nthe switch to digital, and the film\ndistributors followed suit, with fewer\nand fewer films being printed on\n35mm. In 2013 it was estimated at\nthat 92% of US cinemas had switched,\nand the last of the large UK cinemas,\nVue, had converted. By January 2014\nmost major UK distributors began\ndistributing films only in digital\nformats, with Disney and Warner,\nthe last two companies stopping\nsoon after. Now only directors with\nenough clout in the film world can\nget their films printed on 35mm, and\nit is thought that Christopher Nolan\u2019s\nInterstellar could be the last film in\nthe UK to be printed in the format.\nIt is possible that soon in the\nfuture these digital projectors could\nthemselves become obsolete, with\nlarge amounts of money going into\nresearch into laser projection. This\nwould mean that the films would\nbe projected much brighter, with a\ngreater range of colours.\nThe current main issue with this is\nthat a vast cooling system is needed\nto keep the projector at a constant\ntemperature as this leads to a colour\nchange, obviously a large problem\nwith film projection. However lasers\nare being developed that are based\non different technologies that are\nmuch easier to keep cool meaning\nthe challenges of keeping the laser\nat a constant temperature would be\nfewer. Until then, the screen belongs\nto digital.\nAn example of vinegared acetate film Photo: Wikimedia\nCommons\nA scene from Wizard of Oz, filmed using Technicolor.\nPhoto: Victor Fleming/MGM\nLasers that have been used in a laser projection demo.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 29\nFELIX 06.03.2015\n...Musical \u2014 Next To Normal\nBEN HOWITT\nC&S EDITOR\n...Play \u2014 The Importance of Being Earnest\nJACK STEADMAN\nFILM EDITOR\nIhave such an obvious fondness\nfor Arcadia \u2013 and for Stoppard\u2019s\nwork in general \u2013 that my picking\nit as my favourite play seems like a\nforegone conclusion. So let\u2019s side step\nthat conversation by turning straight\nto my second-favourite play. Now\ncomes the requirement to actually\nthink about the answer to this.\nThere are quite a few candidates\n\u2013 Jez Butterworth\u2019s Jerusalem and\nMojo spring up as early contenders,\nalongside the brilliantly funny One\nMan, Two Guv\u2019nors by Richard Bean.\nBut the winner is probably Oscar\nWilde\u2019s last \u2013 greatest \u2013 play, The\nImportance of Being Earnest.\nThere\u2019s a lot of history surrounding\nEarnest, not least the part it played\nin Wilde\u2019s eventual trial and\nimprisonment for \u201cgross indecency\u201d.\nIt was at the opening night that the\nMarquess of Queensbury, father\nof Wilde\u2019s lover (and somewhat\ndispleased at this arrangement),\nattempted to present Wilde with\na bouquet of rotten vegetables (he\nfailed), and it was during the show\u2019s\nrun that Wilde and Queensbury\u2019s\nfeud made its way to the courts.\nEarnest marked the pinnacle of\nWilde\u2019s career, with the downfall\nthat must follow such a claim coming\nbrutally swiftly. 86 performances\nlater, Earnest closed. Public opinion\nwas no longer on Wilde\u2019s side.\nDespite that, Earnest endures.\nDespite all the controversy\nsurrounding it, despite the\ndepressingly short original run, it\ncontinues to find itself being revived\non a near-constant basis, regularly\nappearing in some new form in the\nWest End.\nThe reason for that can be found\nin the sheer joy of seeing Earnest\nperformed. Described in its full\ntitle as \u201ca trivial comedy for serious\npeople\u201d, this is a play that takes\nneither itself, the audience, nor its\napparent targets seriously. It\u2019s as\nmuch a farce as anything, dealing as it\ndoes with multiple cases of mistaken\nidentity \u2013 each of them equally\nimprobable \u2013 as well as ridiculous\nfascinations with names as a reason\nfor marriage.\nTaking the text itself and\nexamining it, there\u2019s not always\nmuch to recommend Earnest. The\nplot \u2013 as mentioned \u2013 is absurd.\nThe characterisations are often\nflimsy. The satire is, these days,\nborderline toothless, and the capacity\nto introduce new relevance \u2013 as in\nShakespeare \u2013 is limited.\nAnd yet, when put in the hands\nof a skilled cast, it springs to life;\njokes that seem dated on the page are\nsuddenly hilarious; there\u2019s enormous\nspace for physical comedy; the\ninterplay between the characters is a\njoy to behold when the lines are being\nthrown, rapid-fire, between skilled\nactors.\nEarnest is the ultimate example of\na \u2018fun play\u2019. It\u2019s hugely entertaining\nwith a good cast, and from the other\nside it\u2019s a treat to perform. It\u2019s a far,\nfar smarter play than its surfaces\nsuggest \u2013 I stand by all my claims of\ntoothless satire and limited relevance\n\u2013 because its apparent lack of any real\nsubject is the whole point.\nEarnest is as much Wilde\u2019s two-fingered salute to the literary\nestablishment of the day, and it\u2019s\na salute that holds true now. As an\nartistic point alone, it\u2019s fantastic. The\nfact it\u2019s fun to perform and watch is\nsimply a bonus.\nPortrait of Oscar Wilde, Napol\u00e9on Sarony, 1882 Credit: Creative\nCommons\nNext to Normal, with book and\nlyrics by Brian Yorkey and\nmusic by Tom Kitt, follows\nDiana, a bipolar depressive with a\ndead son, a rock star psychiatrist, a\ndaughter she describes as \u201ca freak\u201d\n(and her stoner boyfriend)... and Dan,\nher husband.\nWhen it was on Broadway\nduring 2009-11, the production\ncontroversially won the Pulitzer\nPrize, and also gained a cult following\non YouTube and Twitter, before\nclosing in January 2011.\nBipolar depression is not an\neasy topic to write a musical about\n\u2013 and the pain felt by many of\nthe characters is scarily real. The\nvarious attempts made to manage\nDiana\u2019s condition correspond to real\nlife treatments for bipolar II, and\nwatching each of them try, and fail, to\nheal \u201cthe cut, the break... in your soul\u201d\nis terrifying to watch.\nThe addition of Diana\u2019s son Gabe\ninto the mix lends something of a\nsinister, seductive aspect to the show.\nTheir scenes, culminating in Diana\nbeing led to attempt suicide, are made\nmore worrying by the fact that it\nisn\u2019t until the middle of the first act\nthat we even find out he\u2019s died, and\nit becomes clear just how far Diana\u2019s\npsychosis has progressed.\nThis is not to say that the musical\nis altogether depressing. Diana\u2019s\ndaughter Natalie and her boyfriend,\nHenry, have some incredibly sweet\nmoments as he tries to pull her out\nof her own spiral towards substance\nabuse and depression. Their arc,\nending as it began, with the word \u201cI\ncould be perfect for you\u201d, is tinged\nwith a bittersweet acceptance of the\nother.\nEven Dan and Gabe find a\nresolution of sorts. Natalie and her\nmother reconcile, and we are left with\na more balanced, if disparate, family,\nsearching for \u201cthe light in the dark\u201d.\nIs Next to Normal misogynistic?\nMaybe. It\u2019s certainly true that Dan\nis presented as a sympathetic figure\nand Diana as something of a home\nwrecker. Natalie is similarly seen to\nbe unable to handle things without\nthe strong hand of Henry. Even the\nend of Dan\u2019s arc relegates her to the\nstatus of a caregiver. And it fails the\nBechdel Test. Which, given how much\nelse Natalie and her mother might\nhave to talk about, is quite upsetting.\nThe music, though, is wonderful.\nIt doesn\u2019t have the richness of\nBernstein, nor does it require the\nvocal gymnastics required for works\nby Jason Robert Brown. Despite this,\nit stands up as one of the strongest\nexamples of a rock musical score\nI have heard to date, making it a\nworthy winner of the 2009 Tony for\nBest Original Score.\nThe show taps elements of the\nhuman experience that we don\u2019t get\nto see all that often, filling a void\nleft unattended since Jekyll and Hyde\nwas released in 1997. It\u2019s not perfect\n\u2013 it\u2019s not normal \u2013 but it opens out\nthe scope of musicals beyond what\u2019s\nbeen done before and since. Yorkey\nand Kitt have done well with Bring\nit On, the musical based on the little\ncheerleading squad that could, and\nIf/Then, which starred Wicked and\nFrozen\u2019s Idina Menzel. Maybe they\ncould use some of this success to\nlaunch a full British production?\nOnly time will tell.

The reason\nI say it is arguably misleading is\nthat there are very few games, both\ntabletop and otherwise, in which the\nplayer does not take on a role. Yet the\nterm roleplaying game nevertheless\nhas a very precise definition. An RPG\nis, specifically, a game in which the\nplayer takes on the role of a specific\ncharacter and controls that character\nthrough various encounters. Often,\nthe character is represented by various\nnumbers and statistics, but the key\npart is that RPGs are about each player\ncontrolling a single character.\nBroadly, I split RPGs up into\nthree groups: cRPGs, MMOs, and\ntabletop RPGs. cRPG is a term used\nto mean computer RPG \u2013 that is, any\nroleplaying game that is a video game.\nIn these, stats are very important\nand you have a fixed goal to achieve.\nExamples of cRPGs are Neverwinter\nNights, the Elder Scrolls series (of\nwhich Skyrim is the latest), and the\nFinal Fantasy series. MMO stands for\nMassively Multiplayer Online, and\nMMORPGs are very similar to cRPGs\n(technically being a subcategory of\nthem). But the difference is that where\nthe former are normally one player\nand have a single storyline, the latter\nfocus on player interaction and often\nhave ever-changing storylines where\neach player can have an impact on the\ngame world.\nTabletop RPGs are a completely\ndifferent beast. In a tabletop RPG, one\nplayer takes on the role of the \u201cGames\nMaster\u201d, or GM, which is effectively\ntaking on the role of the computer\nin the other types of RPGs. The GM\ncontrols any characters not controlled\nby the players, the world around them,\nand sets the difficulty of tasks \u2013 it\u2019s\nnot an easy job to do! Often, these\ntasks have a randomisation element to\ndetermine whether or not the player\nsucceeds. The simplest version is to\nroll a die, add a number representing\nthe character\u2019s ability, and compare\nthis to a number set by the GM\nrepresenting the difficulty of the task.\nThere are a few things you need\nto do if you want to get started with\nRPGs. You should be aware of the\nrole of the GM, and decide whether\nor not you\u2019d be willing to take that\nrole on (remember that a GM is an\narbitrator, not an opponent!), you\nneed to find people to play with, and\nyou\u2019ve got to have an idea of what sort\nof game you want to play. RPGs can\nbe split into three categories (as well as\ncombinations of them), and this can\nreally help narrow down what players\nlike in a game.\nThe first of the three categories\nis \u2018gamism\u2019. In essence, these are\nthe RPGs where there is a strategic\nchoice to make in what you do \u2013 most\ncommonly in combat. Gamist RPGs\noften have combat \u2018minigames\u2019,\nwhich make up a decent chunk\nof any given session. Rather than\nencouraging a player to play true to\na character, games in this category\noften encourage players to create\ncharacters in an \u201coptimal\u201d way, which\ndon\u2019t necessarily line up with choices\nthat make narrative sense, but instead\nallow the character to perform better.\nIf you like to be able to \u2018win\u2019 an RPG,\ngamism is for you.\nSimulationist RPGs focus on\nwhat would be realistic (within their\nuniverse) in any given situation.\nThese are the games where you can\nargue with your GM about the physics\ninvolved in the scene and where they\nmight actually change their plans\nbased on what you say. Simulationist\ngames often have very large rulebooks,\nas they have to account for a large\nnumber of possible situations even\nif they take place in very specific\nsettings. Don\u2019t be put off by this \u2013 you\ndon\u2019t need to read these books cover\nto cover! If you want your RPG to be\nrealistic, simulationism is for you.\nThe final category is narrativism.\nWith narrativist RPGs, the plot is the\nmost important thing. Where gamist\ncharacters often have optimal setups,\nnarrativist ones don\u2019t \u2013 and people\nwho play narrative RPGs a lot might\neven choose to create characters that\ngive them disadvantages relative to\neveryone else (not in terms of stats,\nbut in terms of plot) because they find\nit more fun to play games where their\n\"Broadly,\nI split\nRPGs up\ninto three\ngroups:\ncRPGs,\nMMOs, and\ntabletop\nRPGs.\"\n\u201cGamist\nRPGs are\nwhere\nthere is a\nstrategic\nchoice to\nmake in\nwhat you\ndo.\u201d\nRPGers Heaven: Orcs Nest\nPhoto: Sanchit Sharma\nPhoto, clockwise left to right: gamebooks, nerdist, wikipedia, psiplayhouse, essencer\n\n"

Die by the fringe.\nLong before Kate Moss brought the fringe back into the mainstream in 2007, these indie babes were rocking some seriously vision-impairing styles. Forget Cara Delevingne; where we\u2019re going there are no eyebrows. It\u2019s not about seeing the audience anyway, as long as\nthey can see your fringe and you can see your guitar, and the rain doesn\u2019t hit it, you\u2019re away.\n1Arguably leading to a whole era of indie chicks running down to Headmasters clutching a copy\nof the NME, Lily Allen circa 2007 starts the billing with her heavy set, statement bangs. They\nstart high, making them a real commitment; when it starts sticking to your forehead two days\ninto Glastonbury, all the Kirby grips in the world aren\u2019t going to stop this mother from flowing\nfree. Add hoop earrings and sing in a mockney accent to disguise the fact that you actually went to\nBedales.\n2It\u2019s well known that the more dominant sister in First Aid Kit commands attention through\nfringe presence alone. This eyelid skimming look is teamed with mermaid length in the rest\nof the hair, which can only be achieved by constant attention. It might not look like it, but this\nwoman is braver than all of us; she is a genuine hair\u2019s breadth away from total blindness. A small\nprice to pay to sell out the Royal Albert Hall.\n3What was the boldest thing about Natasha Khan\u2019s (AKA Bat for Lashes) cover for of The\nHaunted Man in 2012? Was it the naked man she had in a fireman\u2019s lift, whose skinny limbs\nwere only just covering her modesty? The shift in her musical style from sweet, feather-and-unicorn-inspired folk to a darker, much more grown-up chamber pop? No, it was that blunt fringe\nand bob combo that really filled column inches.\n4Back in the days (and fringes) of Myspace, relationships could be made or broken by the order\nyour mate decided to put you on their friends list. So too, could careers, and when veteran\nfringe Lily Allen put Kate Nash at number eight on her list, she was instantly catapulted to\nstardom. The twee-as-can-be debut House of Bricks aided this endeavour, as did her fringe. Nash has\nhad quite a style change of late; her last record saw her favouring a \u201840s quiff or perfectly rollered\nfringe; but back then she was the indie archetype: naturally ginger with a scruffy side-swept fringe \u2013\nthe ultimate in low-maintenance.\n5When it comes to the evolution of fringes, few women have achieved what VV Brown has.\nMuch like the total overhaul of her 2009 debut sound, her image (read: fringe) has changed\ndramatically. Her 1950s pin-up fringe was epic and perfectly suited to the sickly sweet \u2018Shark\nin the Water\u2019. Not just a structural achievement, but with flicks and attitude, it was a fringe of the\nmoment. Then in 2013 she emerged with a new album and look. It had higher aspirations than the\nfirst; the retro bangs had been replaced with a staple choppy style and with cheekbones that high,\nshe simply couldn\u2019t go wrong.\nLily Allen\nBat For Lashes\nVV Brown\nKlara S\u00f6derberg\nKate Nash\nLily Allen at the 2007 BRIT Awards.

It is the liquid of the\nGods and the chosen tipple of this\ngreat nation. Make no mistake; to sip\na piping hot mug of English breakfast\ntea after a parched stretch is to know\ntrue pleasure. In the last few years I\nhave picked up a few tips on how to\nbest prepare ones cuppa, regardless of\nwhich type of breakfast tea you drink.\nSo, laid out before you is a handy cut\nout \u2018n\u2019 keep guide to optimising your\nbrew, if you are interested.\nFirstly, try your private best not to\nadd sugar. With sugar, tea is reduced\nto a sweet solution not fit for man or\nbeast. To those of you who add sugar:\nI used to be like you. But one fateful\nday my mother helped me see the\nmatter in its proper light. She told\nme \u201cTry your tea without sugar for\na week and then make up your own\nmind.\u201d This maternal counsel wasn\u2019t\njust diplomatic; it was downright\nwisdom. After only a few short days,\nvirtue had triumphed. I implore you\nto try this for yourself.\nSecondly, pour the boiling water\ninto the cup before the milk. Here I\nam assuming that everyone puts the\ntea bag in before anything else. Some\nfind that the addition of milk detracts\nfrom the taste of their tea, but most\npeople are inclined to reduce the\nstrength and bitterness of their cuppa\nwith a modest splash of milk. When\nit comes to adding milk, always do\nso after you have poured the boiling\nwater, with the tea bag already in.\nI cannot stress this point enough.\nTea, you see, is a dried herb. And in\norder for tea to release its intrinsic\nqualities, it requires to be infused.\nThis infusion will only occur if the\nwater is boiling when it hits the tea.\nSo if you put the milk in the cup first\nyou have removed all possibility of\ngenuine infusion, not to mention\nthat you will almost certainly pour\ntoo much. It\u2019s difficult to gauge these\nthings. As an aside, I would also\nrecommend using the least creamy\ntype of milk available in order to\nprevent the tea from acquiring too\nmuch of a sickly taste.\nBut for heaven\u2019s sake pour the\nboiling water in before the milk and\ndon\u2019t add any sugar. Grasp only this,\nand the time I\u2019ve earnestly frittered\naway on this article will have been\nworthwhile.\nSo there you go, the perfect cup of\ntea. Apart from everything else, what\ncould possibly be more important\nthan that? Don\u2019t let anyone tell you\nwe don\u2019t cover the big issues here at\nFelix.\nWhat goes in first, the tea or the milk? Photo: silversurfers.com\nGentle reader, I\u2019m certain that\nI am only the latest in a long\nline of commentators to\ncompare two of the greatest influences\nin our British lives: tea and sex. While\nthese might initially appear to have\nas much in common as, say, fashion\nsense and Islamic State, there\u2019s a\ngreat deal of common ground. Like\ntea, sex can be enjoyed alone but is\nbest enjoyed in company. Sex can be\ndelightful when black, white or even\nChinese (do try them all!). Like tea,\nthings are surprisingly nice when they\nget fruity (or even herbal...).\nNow, gentle reader, you may\nwonder why I am bringing this to\nyour attention. While, as scientists,\nwe know that symmetry suggests\ncommon physical laws, in fact I wish\nto use this to illustrate a problem\nwith a common habit in the tea-drinking community. Readers, your\ncommenter is a purist. I enjoy my tea\nwith nothing added and I enjoy my\nHow do you like your tea?\nJoshua Renken is really pedantic about making tea\nThis purist likes their tea and biscuits kept separate\n\"Like tea,\nsex can be\nenjoyed\nalone but\nis best\nenjoyed in\ncompany.\"\n\"sticky\nand an\ninevitable\nsource\nof brown\nmess.\"\nsex similarly naked.\nWhen someone proposes dunking\nbiscuits into my tea, I am aghast!\nAt first thought, to be sure, it\nseems a happy convergence: are\ntwo enjoyable things not more\nenjoyable together? There are, alas,\nless happy ramifications: chocolate\nand the sweat inevitable to bedroom\nactivities are not happy bedfellows.\nWhile it encourages licking, it diverts\nattention and diminishes sensitivity.\nIn short, a chocolate digestive in my\ntea is like chocolate body paint in my\nbedroom - surprisingly sticky and an\ninevitable source of brown mess.\nI won\u2019t pretend that I don\u2019t like tea\nand biscuits together, nor that I\u2019d\nkick someone out of bed for bringing\nchocolate, but I think we can all agree\nit\u2019s better for everyone if the twain\nnever quite meet.

I only started frequenting\nSoho\u2019s GOSH! Comics for the\nsexy men and proximity to good\nrecord stores. Before I started lurking\nin the graphic novel section of\nWaterstones, I thought comics simply\nprovided fuel for Marvel Studios\nto re-hash into a new blockbuster\nevery summer. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\nI know my Aquaman from my Iron\nMan, but beyond the necessary\ngeneral knowledge to get me through\na rogue DC/Marvel question during\nMastermind, I just wasn\u2019t interested.\nAnd I\u2019m still not interested in the\nworld of superhero comics, despite\nrecent expansion from the cis\nwhite male template that the genre\ntraditionally serves so well. The latest\nincarnation of Ms Marvel, written by\na female Muslim convert, is a teenage\nPakistani living in New York. Her\nparents are terrified she\u2019ll have sex or\nnot become a doctor.\nDespite these totally identifiable\nthemes, the stories themselves do\nlittle for me. I like sci-fi, but I also\nlike comedy and beautiful pictures.\nI want mature stories, an exciting\npremise that can be snappily summed\nup in a sentence and a little bit of\nsmut. Behold Sex Criminals. Forget\nstolen kisses between Superman\nand the odd mermaid, Sex Criminals\nprovides it hard, fast and from page\n1. With drawings by Chip Zdarsky\nwho\u2019s just been given the reigns by\nMarvel to reinvent Howard the Duck,\nand words from Matt Fraction of\nHawkeye fame, it\u2019s a fantasy comic\nby people who admit they don\u2019t have\na lot of loyalty towards the genre.\nAnd I think this shows, for the most\npart, making it a nice introduction\nfor the comic novice. There are no\nbackstories to get bogged down in, no\narguing in the forums over nuances\nimplied way back in \u201987 and it passes\nthe Bechdel test. The first volume,\n\u2018One Weird Trick\u2019, introduces our\nmain characters, Suzie and Jon, who\nfeel like the world stops when they get\ndown on it. Except it literally does, so\nthey decide to rob banks during their\npost-coital bliss.\nThis premise alone sold it to me,\nand as well as straight up sex jokes\nthroughout, the subtle background\npuns make it a re-readable buy.\nZdarsky\u2019s futuristic and downright\nsexy layouts are the perfect\ncomplement to the cheeky content.\nAt one point, Apple deemed it too\nrude to read on their devices, and\nprevented its download on iOS via\niTunes or the huge comic viewing\nplatform comiXology. This was a\nmultifaceted error on their part;\npeople weren\u2019t stopped from viewing\nthe first issue after Apple realised\nthey didn\u2019t want to publish the\nsecond and this arguably fuelled\npeople\u2019s intrigue.\nLike anything forbidden, it\nbecame far more interesting. Plus,\nquite embarrassing for a forward\nthinking company that prides itself\non empowering creative types to\nhave banned Time magazine\u2019s Comic\nof the Year. Most importantly,\nthe decision was ill-informed. Sex\nCriminals is not for getting off on.\nZdarsky uses his mates as models for\nSusie and Jon, which he says limits\nthe amount of gratuitous sexiness\nsince he has to direct his friends into\nsimulating said acts (Love Actuallystyle). It\u2019s certainly not all smut, and\nthe second volume that came out\nlast week sees Jon and Suzie move\nbeyond the honeymoon phase. The\nbank robbing has lost its shine and\nthe young couple are suffering under\nall the strains that being able to stop\ntime when you climax brings. There\nwas more depth and humour than I\nwas expecting in my first dalliance\nwith comics, even if it\u2019s too rude to\nread on the tube.\nSex Criminals: Volume 2 is out now on\nImage Comics\nSex Criminals: Volume 1, our Music Editor\u2019s comic of choice Credit:\nImage Comics\n...Musician \u2014 Taylor Swift\nTESSA DAVEY\nCOMMENT EDITOR\nAnyone who knows me will\nknow that I have a particular\npenchant for Taylor Swift.\nWhether I\u2019m posting new Swifty\n(while I realise that Swiftie is the\ntumblr-accepted spelling, I prefer it\nwith a y, okay?) videos on people\u2019s\nwalls on Facebook with overexcited\ncaptions, OMG!!!1!

    "content": "34 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nThe field of optics was\nfounded during the scientific\nrevolution, leading to\nlarge improvements in lenses.\nPhotographic paper was first\ndeveloped in the 19th\ncentury,\naround the same time that the first\nphonographic sound recordings were\nhappening. Once these three existed,\nit was only a matter of time until\nthey were combined to make the first\nmoving pictures.\nThe very simplest form of moving\nimage is one that has been made by\nevery primary school child for the\npast century, the zoetrope. A cylinder\nwith vertical slits along the side,\nwith series of images pasted onto the\ninside, zoetropes would then be spun\nto create the illusion of movement.\nThese were very popular with\nVictorian children and adults alike,\nand are still a popular gift.\nThe first true projector was the\nzoopraxiscope, invented by Eadweard\nMuybridge in 1879. It is based on\na similar concept to the zoescope,\nprojecting images from a set of\nrapidly rotating glass disks. It was\nthe zoopraxiscope that created the\nfirst moving picture of something\nin real time, rather that using staged\nphotographs. The first example was\nof a galloping horse, and was actually\ndeveloped to see if a horse had all\nfour feet on the ground at the same\ntime whilst galloping. Early models\nhad the images painted onto the\nglass, while later ones would print the\noutlines and then do the colouring\nby hand.\nIt is thought that this device is\none of the main inspirations for the\nkinetoscope, the first commercial\nfilm exhibition system, where the\nmoving pictures would be viewed\nby by looking through a spyhole.\nThough the original concept was\nsuggested by Thomas Edison, it was\nactually mostly developed by one\nof the employees in the Edison labs,\nWilliam Dickson. They also created\nthe kinetograph, one of the earliest\nfilm cameras that could be used to\ncreate films for the kinetoscope,\nand a few years later released\nthe kinetophone, combining the\nkinetoscope with a phonograph, the\nfirst film-sound system.\nCelluloid was first invented as\nParkesine in 1856, and was made into\nphotographic film by thinly slicing\nblocks of celluloid then using heated\npressure plates to remove the slice\nmarks. These were then coated with\na photosensitive gelatin emulsion.\nThis process was perfected in 1888.\nIt was a 380mm wide strip made\nby this process that was used in the\nkinetograph. However this was too\nstiff to meet the needs of motion\npicture photography, so more flexible\ncelluloids were developed to be used\nby 1889.\nIt was the Blair Camera Company\nthat supplied the Edison labs with\nfilm stock. Originally they only\nsupplied film that was 40mm\nwide, which would then be cut and\nperforated to 35mm wide with four\nperforations that allowed the film\nto be moved through the camera.\nEventually Blair began supplying\nfilm that was already cut to size. The\nsize and perforations were patented\nby Edison, forcing the other film\nproducers in the US to create 68mm\nfilm and a friction feed method\nto move it through the camera. In\n1902 a court decision invalidated\nthe patent claim, allowing anyone to\nuse the Edison format, as has been\nhappening in Europe where no patent\nhad be filed originally.\nAt this time there were many\nprojectors based on similar concepts,\nmoving the film past a lens which\nwould focus light onto the film,\nwhich would then be projected onto a\nscreen. However different companies\nwould build them slightly differently,\nso the film would have to perforated\nslightly differently depending on\nwhat equipment a cinema would\nhave. The Edison format was the\ndominant version, and this was\nchosen by the Motion Picture\nPatents Company in 1909 as the\nofficial standard, along with a 1.33\naspect ratio. This standardisation\nhad an enormous impact on the\nfilm industry, as this meant that all\nprojectors were built to the same\nspecification, so for example a film\nrecorded in the US could then be\nplayed anywhere in the world.\nIt was around this time that\ncelluloid began to be replaced, due to\nthe fact that it had the unfortunate\nproblem of spontaneously\ncombusting above 150\u00b0C, a\ntemperature that could easily be\nreached in a projector. It had the\nadded problem of creating its own\noxygen supply as it burnt, meaning\nthat even if placed underwater\nthe film would continue to burn.\nAcetate cellulose film was developed\nto combat this issue, first being\nproduced in 1909, with several\nrevisions over the next few decades.\nThe safety of acetate film meant\nthat there was a large boom in the\nhome cinema industry. In 1923\nKodak released 16mm wide film, as\na cheaper alternative to 35mm. This\nwas followed up by a standard double\n8mm wide film in 1932 as an even\ncheaper alternative. This worked by\nfirst filming on one side of the film,\nthen flipping the film in the camera\nand filming onto the other side of\nthe film. These would then be cut in\nhalf and spliced together to form a\ncontinuous 8mm film to be projected.\nIn 1965 an improved version known\nas Super 8 was released, which had\nfar better visual quality and did not\nEllen Mathieson takes you through the last one hundred and fif\nA modern zoetrope, to be veiwed by looking through the slits\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\nA kinetoscope, the first commercial exhibition system\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\nA single frame of 35mm film, with the soundtrack at the top\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\n\"Once\nthese three\nexisted, it\nwas only a\nmatter of\ntime until\nthey were\ncombined\nto make the\nfirst moving\npictures.\"\n\"Even if\nplaced\nunderwater\nthe film\nwould\ncontinue to\nburn\"\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\nOnce more into the lens: T\n\n"

    "content": "54 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nKamil McClelland reviews the Symphony Orchestra\u2019s Spring Concert\nHitting The Right Notes: ICSO at Cadogan Hall\nTonight was a first in two\nrespects; not only was it my\nfirst time attending a concert\nin the gorgeous Cadogan Hall but\nit was also in fact the first ever time\nI had seen the Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra (ICSO) perform.\nAnd so, as you can imagine I was\nsuitably excited.\nThis was their Spring Concert,\na celebration of a term of hard\nwork and careful planning. For our\nenjoyment they were performing\nGershwin\u2019s \u2018An American in Paris\u2019;\nMozart\u2019s \u2018Piano Concerto in D\nMinor\u2019; \u2018In the Steppes of Central\nAsia\u2019 by Borodin; and finally the\nincendiary \u2018Firebird Suite\u2019 by\nStravinsky. It was a crammed and\nvery varied schedule, designed to\nillustrate the broad range of the\norchestra\u2019s repertoire. I was also\neager to see Martin James Bartlett, an\n18-year-old pianist and winner of the\nBBC \u2018Young Musician\u2019 Award in 2014,\nabout whom I had heard great things,\nperform alongside the orchestra on\nthe Mozart concerto.\nExpectations were running high as\nthe orchestra took their place on the\nstage in front of me.\nAnd so, we dived straight into\nGershwin\u2019s classic, a symphonic\npoem laced with generous helpings\nof jazz melody. He described it as\n\u201cthe impression of an American\nvisitor in Paris\u201d, simultaneously\nabsorbing the atmosphere of the\nFrench capital in the 1920s and a\n\u201cspasm of homesickness\u201d in the\nform of syncopated rhythms based\naround the twelve-bar blues format.\nIt truly is a beautiful tune, full of\nthe excitement and dynamism of\nthe Roaring \u201820s, done justice by this\nimpassioned orchestra. How lucky we\nare to have such a talented group of\nmusicians on our doorstep!\nTo criticise them, I have to hold\nthem to the highest of standards \u2014\nperhaps they did not flow as well as\na truly integrated orchestra might,\nunable to fully embody the dreamy\nstate of the piece, the vivid whirlwind\nof sights and sounds every person\nexperiences when they visit such an\nexciting city. I wasn\u2019t completely\ntransported away to this foreign\nland though not for a lack of effort;\nthe singing strings did a particularly\nexcellent job manipulating my\nemotions every which way. The\nproblems lay mainly in a lack of time\nand dynamic manipulation, but then\nI am picking at the smallest of holes.\nHowever, as Gershwin himself\nadmits, \u201cit\u2019s not a Beethoven\nSymphony, you know\u201d but instead a\n\u201clight, jolly piece\u201d. Can this piece ever\nbe more than that, merely a pleasant\ncollection of notes, a musical in the\nworld of operas? Thus, as we went\nnext to Mozart\u2019s piano concerto,\nan incongruous pairing for certain,\nI wondered how this selection of\npieces, a complete mess of genres and\nemotions with no clear overarching\ntheme, was chosen. You do not\nexperience music as a singularity, it is\nall about context. Hence, by placing\nall of these pieces together, I felt I was\nnot able to truly witness their depth\nof emotion \u2013 a real shame.\nNext we were transported back to\n18th\nCentury Vienna, and Mozart\u2019s\n\u2018Piano Concerto in D Minor\u2019, a\nconsiderably darker piece than\nGershwin\u2019s jolly little number. The\nfearsome strings build up to a forte\nalong with the rest of the orchestra,\npowerful in their presence on stage.\nThen the young virtuoso Bartlett\ntakes the lead, with the orchestra\nin accompaniment \u2013 a tremendous\npianist with a deft touch on the keys\neffortlessly glinting beneath his\nfingers. He certainly doesn\u2019t lack\ncharisma; you can read the emotion\nin his face and body language as\nwell as in his music. This showman\nstyle of solo piano playing is not\none I particularly like \u2013 perhaps his\nmasterclass with Lang Lang rubbed\noff a bit too much \u2013 however, you\ncannot deny his skill.\nThe piece is incredibly lyrical,\ntaking us on a journey from the\nsombre to the joyous, with ascending\narpeggios vaulting up from the\ninstruments into the music hall.\nHaving said that, it is not my\nfavourite piece; sometimes boring,\noften repetitive, at least it was\nperformed well.\nThe interval came and went in no\ntime at all, and as I made my way\nback to my seat I readied myself for a\nshort but sweet trip across the serene\ngrasslands of Central Asia. Borodin\u2019s\nsymphonic poem tells a simple\nbut elegant story: that of a trading\ncaravan of horses and camels crossing\nthe vast emptiness accompanied by\nRussian soldiers. This manifests itself\nas a complex blend of Western and\nEastern melodies, an amalgam of a\ngentle Russian tune with \u201cbizarre\nand melancholy notes of an oriental\nmelody\u201d. And through this all is the\ncontinuity of the desert winds and the\ntrudging of pack animals. It is a truly\nbeautiful story, requiring respectful\nand vivid playing.\nThis was generally well done, with\nbeautifully flowing strings and flute,\nserene and peaceful. However, in\nparts it did not feel suitably delicate,\nas if the players did not have in their\nminds the specific vision of the piece,\nresulting in parts being too coarse or\nloud.\nAnd finally, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance:\n\u2018The Firebird\u2019 Suite by Stravinsky.\nThis is the score that catapulted\nStravinsky into the limelight and\nrepresented the start of his very\nfruitful partnership with ballet\npatron Sergei Diaghilev which led\nto the production of \u2018Petrushka\u2019 and\n\u2018The Rite of Spring\u2019. Thus the piece\u2019s\nsignificance cannot be underplayed,\nwith Diaghilev even saying of the\nyoung composer that he was \u201ca man\non the eve of celebrity\u201d. And you can\nfully understand why this was said of\nhim on the debut of its performance\nin 1910 for the Ballets Russes\ncompany in Paris. It is absolute\ngenius.\nIt was by far the most interesting\npiece of the night. Emerging out\nof the rich murkiness of the cellos\nand double basses like a primordial\nsludge, you are enraptured by\nStravinsky\u2019s imagination, truly the\npinnacle of early 20th\nCentury art. It\nwas also the best played of the night;\nthe brute force of the percussion\nand brass gave it real punch when it\nwas most required, simultaneously\nas the harps rushed back and forth\nacross the soundscape, a marvellous\nexperience to behold.\nWhat a way to end it! Does\nanything compare to modern\nworks like this? Why ICSO insists\non including the likes of Mozart in\ntheir lineup when they could have a\nwhole night of 20th\nCentury works I\ndo not know. But it was a wonderful\nnight overall and I would thoroughly\nrecommend anyone to attend ICSO\u2019s\nfuture performances, provided they\ncan create better cohesion with their\nchoice of repertoire.\nImperial College Symphony Orchestra at Cadogan Hall for their Spring Concert Photo: Ian Gillet\n\"How lucky\nwe are to\nhave such\na talented\ngroup of\nmusicians\non our\ndoorstep!\"\n\"The brute\nforce of the\npercussion\nand brass\ngave it\nreal punch\nwhen it\nwas most\nrequired.\"\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

A Council Chair candidate\nwas struck down by a 9 oz steak after\nadmitting that he had never actually\nbeen to a Union Council meeting. He\nwas left feeling raw and disillusioned,\nand was unable to recover in time\nbefore suffering a hailstorm of\nchicken nuggets after also admitting\nthat he thought the Union Council\nhad the power to decrease pint\nprices.\nThe student running for Deputy\nPresident (Education) suffered from\nseveral blows from a wrack of BBQ\nribs after stating they would reduce\nthe ratio of students to staff in\ntutorials; many of the BBQ ribs were\nactually thrown by overstretched\nacademics who don\u2019t have the spare\ntime to teach more.\nA student running for Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services) took\na flurry of chicken wings to the body\nrepeatedly after wanting to increase\nmoney for clubs and societies,\nbut not knowing where this extra\nmoney will come from. Someone\nalso threw part of a shepherd\u2019s pie at\nanother DPFS candidate\u2019s face, after\nsuggesting the Union could still do\naway with entry fees.\nDeputy President (Welfare) fared\nconsiderably worse; after promising\nto reform the personal tutor system,\nsomeone threw a whole salmon at\nher face, knocking her off a chair and\nleaving a fishy grease stain down\nher top. Said the student who threw\nthe fish: \u201cYou can\u2019t teach academics\nempathy\u201d.\nPresidential candidates suffered\nworst; one took a heavy blow from\na whole turkey after stating that\nthey would ensure College wouldn\u2019t\nclose Weeks hall. Their opponent\nreceived the most painful attack of\nthe night, when they stated that they\nwould introduce a new consultation\nframework, despite the current\none left untouched and unused for\nmonths now.\nIt took two people to throw the hog\nroast at the poor girl, and she was\nknocked out cold before a stretcher\ncame to carry her away.\nDespite many of the candidates\nleaving feeling bruised, those who\ncame to throw the meat said they\nwere a lot happier with the elections\nseason, and also felt they had truly\nengaged for the first time in years.\nSaid one final year student: \u201cI\u2019ve\nnever voted in the four years I\u2019ve been\nat Imperial, but for the first time ever\nI feel I\u2019ve been able to constructively\ncommunicate my views to the Union\nover the issues that matter to me.\nNothing says \u201cstudent dissatisfaction\nwith student coursework deadlines\u201d\nlike throwing a whole fish at a\nsabbatical candidate.\u201d\n\u201cMeat the Candidates\u201d claims several casualties\n\n"

While the film has\nreceived numerous comparisons to\nGirls, no doubt helped by the fact that\nAkhavan has a recurring role in this\nseason of Lena Dunham\u2019s brainchild,\nit is clear from the beginning that\nAkhavan\u2019s vein of humour is more\nbrash, nuanced, and utterly unique.\nThe indie comedy equivalent of\na triple threat, Akhavan has both\nwritten and directed the film, and\nappears as the main character Shirin,\nwho we first meet as she collects her\nstuff in preparation for moving out\nof her girlfriend Maxine\u2019s (Rebecca\nHenderson) apartment; throwing\nthe whole lot in the bin, she then\nreconsiders, pausing to retrieve a\nstrap-on, which she half-heartedly\ncarries along the streets of a summertime Brooklyn. Told through a\nseries of flashbacks, a move that is\nobviously indebted to Annie Hall\n\u2013 Akhavan has herself admitted as\nsuch \u2013 we follow Shirin as she tries\nto forget that she was once loved\nby making a series of increasingly\nunwise, and hilarious, life decisions.\nAs a second generation immigrant,\nShirin is walking precariously along\na tightrope, one day attending a\nPersian new year\u2019s party, the next\nheading to an art show to see a\nfriend \u201cdress up like a farm animal\nand touch herself\u201d. It is this strain,\nmagnified by the fact that Shirin\nhas a \u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u2019 policy\nwith her parents when it comes to\nher sexuality, even when they are\nconfused as to why their daughter\nis living with another woman in a\none-bed apartment, that leads to\nthe break-up of the relationship. As\npart of the healing process, Shirin\ndecides to get a new job, taking up\nthe offer of the friend of a friend\nto teach filmmaking to a group of\n\u201creally talented, clever Brooklyn\nchildren\u201d, who turn out to be a group\nof 5-year-old boys. With her grief and\nlibido increasing, she soon begins to\nregress to her students\u2019 level, pulling\never more immature stunts to try and\nmake Maxine jealous.\nWhile Akhavan is the obvious\nstar here, the supporting cast are\nequally strong. The ex-girlfriend\nis a particularly difficult role, but\nHenderson shines in it, managing\nto make Maxine somewhat brittle\nnature seem utterly sympathetic.\nWithin cinema, there seems to be\na trope that true love cannot exist\nwithin a relationship that has gone\nsour; that if their love were \u2018real\u2019, if\nneither of them were \u2018bad people\u2019,\nthen why would they ever break up?\nAkhavan and Henderson use their\nperformances to make it clear that,\nsometimes, shit just happens like that,\nand their relationship isn\u2019t any the\nless for it.\nThe film has an episodic structure,\nwhich is clearly due to Akhavan\u2019s\nexperience producing her online\nweb series The Slope; made with her\nthen-girlfriend Ingrid Jungermann,\nThe Slope revolved around the\nlives of a couple of \u201csuperficial,\nhomophobic lesbians\u201d living in\nPark Slope, Brooklyn. Brilliantly\naccurate, the pair received a great deal\nof media attention thanks to their\nopen willingness to be hypocritical,\nconfusing, and messy individuals.\nIt was this attention that helped\nlead to the generation of Appropriate\nBehaviour, something for which we\nshould all be thankful (so remember,\nwhen you\u2019re \u201cconstantly wasting\nyour life\u201d watching YouTube, you\u2019re\nactually helping the independent\ncinema industry. Take that mum!).\nOne thing that Akhavan does\nbrilliantly is draw attention to\nthe navel-gazing, self-indulgent\ntendencies of millennials, within\nboth the queer community, and the\ngeneral population. Alongside the\ngags about pretentious art shows and\ntaxidermist roommates, there is a\nsubtle commentary on how perhaps\nAkhavan\u2019s generation is horrifically\nself-involved. In one scene, for\nexample, Shirin attends a workshop\non queer justice, which she knows\nMaxine will also be attending; as one\nman tells the group how the \u2018Crime\nAgainst Nature\u2019 laws resulted in him\nbeing branded a sexual predator,\nMaxine and Shirin ignore him\nand argue in the corner about the\nplans they have made, until Shirin\neventually puts her hand up and asks\nthe facilitator \u2013 a law professor at\nNYU \u2013 out for a drink. In another\nscene, Akhavan reveals the two-facedness of Maxine, showing her to\nbe a woman who makes her girlfriend\nread a copy of Stone Butch Blues for\nself-improvement, but will also call\nShirin\u2019s bisexuality \u201cjust a phase\u201d in\none of the most chilling scenes of the\nfilm. Akhavan shows this all quite\nbluntly, but never aims to be mean;\ninstead it is just a gentle reminder\nthat a narcissistic streak is inevitable,\nnot just for Generation Y, but for all\nyoung people.\nWhile the break-up comedy\ngenre will inevitably be bittersweet,\nAkhavan manages to keep things\nfrom becoming cloying thanks to an\nacerbic wit that is both oddball and\ncynical, a fact that sets Appropriate\nBehaviour apart from other, similar\nfilms. As mentioned earlier, Girls is\nan easy reference point, as is Noah\nBaumbach\u2019s Frances Ha; after all,\nthey all feature slightly off-beat\n20-something year old women\ntrying to make their way through\nlife in Brooklyn. But while it is easy\nto see such films as merely more\ncontent in an genre that probably\nreached its peak when people gave\nup $3 million to ensure Zach Braff\ncan make another film ($3 million!),\nAkhavan has created a piece that is\nnot only welcome, but downright\nvital. With her background as a self-identifying bisexual Persian woman,\nAkhavan is the very definition of\nintersectionality, and it is up to\npeople like her to commit their\nexperiences to film.\nAppropriate Behaviour is out now on\nPeccadillo Pictures.\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

With the amount\nof pressure we\u2019re all under on a daily\nbasis, it\u2019s essential to have the support\nof the union behind us.\nAs you might know, I started\nrunning a regular Welfare section in\nFelix this year because I believed we\nneeded to reach more students and\nhelp raise awareness while letting\npeople know what welfare resources\nare available. I\u2019m also familiar with\nhow the union operates due to my\ncurrent roles as both an academic\nrepresentative and a club secretary,\nwhich have given me the necessary\nexpertise for the position.\nMost importantly, through my\nown experiences, I have come to\nknow exactly where the system fails\nto provide students with the support\nthat they need.\nSo what do I plan to do about it? I\nwant to work on two key areas:\nMental Health- Set aside my lunchtimes to talk to\nstudents regarding the mental health\nresources available, and help them\nfind the best options\n- Deal with the abysmal NHS\nwaiting times by running more\ntherapy-based group sessions\n- Work with and/or lobby college\nto expand the counselling services\noffered\nAccessibility \u2013\n- Hold welfare events at other\ncampuses so that medics and other\nstudents not based primarily at South\nKensington can benefit from them\n- Have better personal tutor\ntraining to help support students\nwith welfare issues\n- Provide more training for the\nWelfare and the liberation officers\n- Create resources to address more\nminority specific issues\nDeputy President (Welfare) Diba Esbati\nMy name is Chun-Yin and I am\nthe current ICSMSU Academic\nOfficer (Science Years).

It\u2019s a\ngrowing concern that we and future\ngenerations are facing. Earth\u2019s\nblood, so to speak, is on humanity\u2019s\nhands and it is our responsibility to\nacknowledge, understand and find\nsolutions to this challenge. I talk\nabout \u2018humanity\u2019, but in reality it is\nthe actions of every individual, both\nyou and me, which shape the course\nof our amalgam.\nIn the last 3.5 billion years, Earth\nhas harboured the lives of 4 billion\nspecies in all their myriad forms. 99%\nof these species have gone extinct\nand one day, Homo sapiens\u2019 time\nwill come. What remains in question\nthough is how will we compare to\nall those by-gone species. Will we\nfight to survive? Or will we bury our\nheads in the ground as we juggle our\nindividual lives around and hope that\nsomeone else deals with it?\nPopular amongst scientists and\npoliticians, you might hear about a\n\u2018safe operating space for humanity\u2019.\nThese are nine arbitrarily defined\nbiophysical boundaries that\nshould not be crossed in order to\nensure Earth is able to sustain and\nprovide for our persistence and\nwellbeing. Ones that have already\nbeen surpassed are biodiversity\nloss, climate change and acquisition\nand alteration of nitrogen and\nphosphorous cycles, and increasingly\nwe are creeping up and stepping over\nthe limit for habitat destruction and\nland-use change.\nClimate change is undisputed\nbut the world isn\u2019t going to freeze\novernight or be plagued with some\nterrifying disease, that can all be left\nfor a Friday night in front of the TV\nwith a bag of popcorn. What I\u2019d like\nto do right now is to bust some myths\nand give you a low-down on some\nmajor impacts of global warming\nand what\u2019s going on in the world of\npolitics to stop it.\nClimate change 101\nJust so we\u2019re on the same page.\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) come in\na variety of forms, creating a pretty\ndamaging chemical cocktail. This\nlethal recipe includes infamous\ncarbon dioxide, methane and nitrous\noxide as well as some harder-to-pronounce chemicals: sulphur\nhexafluoride, hydrofluorcarbons and\nperflurocarbons. Their emission into\nthe atmosphere is primarily through\nindustrial outsources, car emissions,\nshipping vessels, domestic appliances\nand deforestation.\nSo how do they cause climate\nchange? Well, about \u00bc of all\nanthropogenic carbon dioxide\nhas gone into the oceans where it\nreacts with water to form carbonic\nacid, which readily dissociates\nto create ionising hydrogen ions\nand bicarbonate which causes\nocean acidification. On top of this,\nincreased GHGs in the atmosphere\ncontribute to a thickening of the\ngreenhouse gas layer, which increases\nre-radiation of heat back to Earth\u2019s\nsurface and the lower atmosphere,\nincreasing ocean warming and\natmospheric warming. Voila.\nClimate change is natural\nand normal. It's happened\nbefore\u2026 right?\nYep. Climate change has happened\nin the past, but it\u2019s not been pretty.\nAlso, crucially, it is the undisputed\ncausal link between increased GHG\nemissions and changes in Earth\u2019s\nclimate as well the relative change\nand magnitude of change that are the\nissue here.\nAround 11.5-13 thousand years ago,\nas the planet warmed after the last ice\nage, melt from polar ice caps caused\na great ocean circulation current, the\nGulf Stream, to shutdown, making\nEuropean temperatures plummet 6\ndegrees into another ice age. The Gulf\nStream is what\u2019s responsible for west\nEurope\u2019s mild climate and recently\nscientists have found evidence to\nsupport the theory that the melting\nof major ice sheets such as Greenland\nand West Antarctic due to global\nwarming could make the Gulf Stream\nshutdown again and ironically cause\nanother glaciation period.\nAlso, what\u2019s interesting is not\nwhat\u2019s changing but what\u2019s staying\nthe same. The North Atlantic\nOscillation Index (NAO), a two-way\npressure system that partly controls\nEurope\u2019s climate, has two phases \u2013\npositive and negative. The strength\nand position of these pressure\nsystems usually changes from year\nto year. However, since 1970s, as a\nresult of increased GHG emissions,\nthe NAO has remained in the positive\nphase meaning that both the low\nand high-pressure systems have\nintensified.\nThis causes the sea level to rise and\nincreases ocean warming, resulting\nin reduced nutrient upwelling as\nwell as other things, depriving fish\nof essential food resources. These\nfish include species that we expect\nto see on supermarket shelves and\nin fishmonger markets. In addition,\nthe NAO controls seasonal variation\nand its persistent positive phase\nhas caused a shift towards earlier\nSprings and later Autumns creating\nphonological mismatches.\nIt\u2019s also important to consider\nthe magnitude of change. Change\ncould have happened in the past but\nthe rate and amplitude varies. The\nSouthern Oscillation is another,\narguably greater contributor to global\nclimate patterns and is responsible\nfor the periodic El Nino/La Nina\nclimate fluctuations in the East\nPacific that are characterised by a 0.5\ndegree increase or decrease in ocean\ntemperature, respectively. Since the\nindustrial revolution and increased\natmospheric warming, the amplitude\nand frequency of El Nino cycles\nhave increased and if we look back to\nthe 1997/8 El Nino, which wreaked\nhavoc for Peruvian anchovy fisheries,\ndecimated the native wildlife on the\nGal\u00e1pagos Islands and cost the US $20\nbillion dollars in damage, this is no\nlight matter.\nSo it is true that climate change\nObligatory photo of a sad looking polar bear.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 21\n06.03.2015\nFELIX\nScience Editor James Bezer & Lauren Ratcliffe\nScience\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis article comes with a health\nwarning. We will be discussing\nEU legislation and, as with all\nthings EU, there will be a wealth of\nunhelpful acronyms and terminology\nfired at you, none more so than\nthose forming the Commission\u2019s\nnew \u2018Energy Union Strategic\nFramework\u2019, officially revealed last\nWednesday. Briefly speaking, this\nhugely ambitious plan intends to\nunite gas and electricity markets in\nthe different regions of Europe and,\neventually, Europe as a whole whilst\nfacilitating the growth of renewables\nat the same time.\nIt must be said that the process\nof integration is complex, from\nphysically connecting all countries\ntogether with big cables, to wading\nthrough the minutiae of new trading\nrules and regulations that will have\nto be implemented. But this process,\na once in a generation infrastructure\nupgrade, is also fascinating. I will\nspare you every tiny detail; I don\u2019t\nknow half them myself. But I will\npick up on one particular morsel\nof policy: that of the obscure, but\nrather wonderful Flow-Based Market\nCoupling (FBMC \u2013 acronym number\n1).\nCoupling Countries\nFirst, let\u2019s put this all into context,\none of the cornerstones of the\nCommission\u2019s Energy Union is\nthe idea of \u2018price convergence\u2019 via\nmarket \u2018coupling\u2019 between countries\n\u2013 essentially making sure electricity\nprices being traded across borders\nare the same or very similar. To\nachieve this you can do two things:\nbuild more interconnecting cables\nand manage those interconnections\nbetter. The first option is, for the\npurposes of this article, relatively\nstraightforward. Build more cables\nbetween countries and you can\ntrade more electricity back and\nforth, meaning you get closer to an\nequilibrium price in both countries.\nIn Germany and France for example,\nwholesale electricity prices were the\nsame 67% of the time in 2011.\nBut how do you pursue option\ntwo and go about managing\ninterconnections better? More\nimportantly, what is so problematic\nthat it requires management to be\nbetter in the first place? When you\nwant electricity, doesn\u2019t it just flow\nthrough the cables without a hitch?\nWell not exactly.\nLoop Flow\nIt is true that electricity will always\nflow along a cable. But if you have a\nlot of those cables in your network,\nit may not flow exactly where you\nwant it to go, choosing the path of\nleast resistance over a \u2018busy\u2019 line.\nThis phenomenon in the networks is\nreferred to as a \u2018loop flow\u2019.\nSomewhat unhelpfully, loop flows\nare sensitive to the variability of solar\nand wind generation, where the more\nrenewables that come onto the grid\nthe more likely it is these loop flows\nwill occur. This is because if a grid\noperator is forecasting anticipated\ndemand for the day ahead, the realtime situation on that actual day may\nbe quite different if, say, the wind\nblows more than expected.\nIf the day-ahead prediction\nis indeed inaccurate, the extra\nelectricity generated can \u2018flood\u2019\ntransmission lines in neighbouring\ncountries that might be less\ncongested. Since the bulk of market\ntrading occurs within national\nborders or cross-border markets\nthat do not correspond with the\ntransmission lines through which\nthis electricity may travel, these\nforecasting errors can create price\nimbalances within and between\ncountries.\nFrom an EU perspective, this is\npotentially disastrous as it drives a\nwedge between the Commission\u2019s\nwork on market integration and\ntheir push for renewable growth,\ntwo things which the Energy Union\nStrategy would dearly like to see as\ncompatible. Yet it does not matter\nhow well designed your market\nsystem is, you cannot tell electrons\nto follow price signals if they have a\nperfectly free transmission line to go\ndown.\nGoing in the Wrong\nDirection\nTo highlight the problem, between\n2011-2012, according to Thema\nConsulting, out of all of the\nelectricity flowing between Germany\nand the Netherlands, some of it was\nphysically flowing in the opposite\ndirection to its destination 74% of\nthe time. Between Switzerland and\nFrance, this happened 95.5% of the\ntime. Whilst the quantity of energy\nwasted in these cases varies, with\nrenewable growth being promoted\nby financial support in different\nGo With the Flow: new EU policy supports\nrenewable energy\nJoshua Emden discusses the impact of flow-based market coupling\ncountries (e.g. Feed-in Tariffs in\nGermany) the situation is only likely\nto get worse.\nIt is in this light that FBMC\nbecomes so critical. In very brief\nterms, FBMC replaces the old notion\nthat Available Transfer Capacity\n(ATC) should be calculated separately\nto the price at which electricity is\ntraded. In this way there is a much\ncloser alignment between the\ndirection of prices in the market and\nthe direction of the electricity across\nthe cable itself. As such, through\nclever algorithms that I will not even\nbegin to unveil (or understand) in\nthis article, FBMC is even able to\nmanipulate the flow of electricity to\nsuit those market prices.\nThrough such a method, the IEA\npredicts that price convergence\nwithin the Central Western European\n(CWE) region could increase from\n58% to 90%. Researchers have even\ngone further, to suggest that if by\n2050 FBMC is not fully implemented,\nthe EU could end up paying \u20ac590\nbillion more than it would need to.\nPlain or Intuitive?\nFBMC is not without its demons. In\nsome circumstances, the algorithm\non which FBMC is based can end up\nsending electricity from a high price\narea to a low price area in order to\nmaximise overall welfare across a\nregion. As a response to this, there is\ncurrently a great deal of discussion\nwithin the CWE region regarding\nwhether or not FBMC should be\n\u2018plain\u2019 or \u2018intuitive\u2019.\nIn the latter instance, rules would be\nset such that prices would always flow\nfrom low to high across borders, but\nrecognising that there may be a loss\nin overall welfare. Ultimately, FBMC\nis problematic if only because of just\nhow complicated it is. Having first\nbeen proposed and agreed by grid\noperators in 2007, it is only now being\napproved as we speak. Assuming no\nfurther delay, FBMC is expected to\nbe implemented in CWE in \u2018early\n2015\u2019. The computational ICT needs,\ndepending on the scale of future\nimplementation, are astronomical.\nSmart Grids\nWhen people talk about \u2018smart grids\u2019,\nI often find myself struggling to\ndescribe exactly what one might look\nlike, let alone what the technologies\ninvolved might be. With FBMC\nthough, the notion that electricity\ncan be controlled by a computer,\nsent in different directions all across\ndifferent borders, and produce lower\nprices as a result certainly seems very\nsmart.\nEven better from the Commission\u2019s\nperspective, FBMC is exactly the sort\nof methodology that could adapt to\nthe variability of renewables as their\nproportion of generation throughout\nthe EU increases and the movement\naway from fossil fuels combustion for\nenergy production commences. Of\ncourse, as with most EU \u2018packages\u2019,\nFBMC will be just one of a number\nof complicated reforms in the grand\nEnergy Union plan.\nBut when we paint a picture of the\nfuture of Europe\u2019s grids, it just might\nbe the smartest.\nUniting gas and electricity markets, a new challenge for the Energy Union Strategic Framework.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 61\nFELIX 06.03.2015\nEt in Arcadia Ego, Unfortunately\nDakota Blue Richards (Thomasina Coverly) in Arcadia by English Touring Theatre Photo:\nMark Douet\nJack Steadman is less than entranced by Stoppard\u2019s classic drama\n\"Much of\nthe comedy\nis lost,\nleaving the\nscript to\nfight for\nitself\"\nAdisclaimer, before this\nreview goes any further. I\nhave extraordinarily strong\nfeelings and opinions about Arcadia.\nI studied the text for A-Level, and\ndirected the show for DramSoc\nin the summer of my first year of\nuniversity. It\u2019s been a huge part of\nmy life for the past few years, and\nit\u2019s only fair to the English Touring\nTheatre production that I make that\nplain before passing comment on\ntheir show.\nOriginally appearing in 1993,\nArcadia is easily Tom Stoppard\u2019s\nmost popular play, if not one of\nEnglish literature\u2019s most popular\nplays \u2013 a claim acknowledged in\nthe programme notes for this latest\nlarge-scale production, where it is\nrevealed that it came near the top\nof their audience poll of future play\nideas. It\u2019s an exquisitely composed\nwork set entirely in the large drawing\nroom of a country house, with scenes\ntransitioning between 1809 and 1993.\nThis single-set approach is usually\na cue for the set designer to go\noverboard with extravagant designs\nfor the room and all its furniture,\nand on first glance this production\nappears to be no exception. A vast\nwall occupies the upper third of\nthe stage, with enormous windows\nlooking out onto the gardens of\nSidley Park, home to the aristocratic\nCoverly family. The room is large,\nand the expansive table squatting\nin the centre of the room does little\nto cover the swathes of empty space\nsurrounding it \u2013 but that\u2019s fine. The\nroom\u2019s emptiness is explained away\nby the script at one stage, and as the\nplay progresses the table (and by\nextension the room) rapidly becomes\nmore cluttered and disorganised,\nechoing one of the key themes of\nthe play. Unfortunately, no excuse\nis given for what lies on the other\nside of the aforementioned large\nwindows. The gardens are revealed\nto simply be the rear wall of the\nstage, in all its undisguised glory. No\npainted backdrop, not even a black\ntab. A grey wall, replete with cabling\nand sockets. Whatever the reason\nfor this particular set choice, it\u2019s not\nexactly the most auspicious start to\nproceedings, considering that the\nhouse opens with the set (and the wall\nbeyond it) clearly visible to the entire\naudience.\nSo far, so unimpressive. But having\nheard the director Blanche McIntyre\nspeak about the play, expressing her\nlove for its complexity and how she\nand the cast spent hours unpacking\nall of the science behind it to ensure\nthey could fully convey the themes to\nthe audience, I\u2019ve got a lot of goodwill\nsitting in the tank, so I\u2019ll let it slide.\nSadly, the first two scenes rather\nquickly threaten to squander every\nlast drop of that goodwill. There are\nsome positive moments \u2013 the scene\nchange is nicely handled, with the\ncharacters from past and present\ncrossing paths with each other on\nstage, drawing attention to the\nsimilarities between the two eras.\nSome of the cast members are simply\nstellar in their performances. Others,\nless so.\nFlora Montgomery deserves\nparticular praise as Hannah Jarvis.\nIn a role created by (and written for)\nFelicity Kendal, she makes it her\nown, perfectly capturing Hannah\u2019s\nblend of external Classicism and\ninternal Romanticism. In the past\nscenes, Kirsty Besterman makes an\nimpact as Lady Croom. The role is\na treat for any actress, providing\nample opportunity to dominate the\nstage, and Besterman runs riot with\nit, taking full advantage of Croom\u2019s\nunwavering control of the scene. It\u2019s\njust a pity that neither actress really\ngets decent sparring competition \u2013 at\nleast not to begin with.\nThere\u2019s a weird sense of lethargy\npermeating the opening scenes,\nstarting with an oddly subdued\nDakota Blue Richards as Thomasina,\nthe prodigal daughter of the house,\nand spreading from there. At times,\nit\u2019s only the sheer joy of the script\nthat saves proceedings, with the jokes\nthemselves, if not their delivery,\nprompting occasional outbursts of\nlaughter. There is some defence for\nthis, in that while the later scenes do a\nlot of the heavy lifting for explaining\n(relatively) complicated scientific\nor mathematical principles, the\nearly scenes have to do a lot of the\ngroundwork for making those ideas\nmake sense in the context of the play\nas well as \u2013 obviously \u2013 introducing\nall the key players.\nBut that defence doesn\u2019t\nreally stand up when an early\nconfrontation, traditionally the part\nwhere the play springs to life after a\nlengthy dialogue between Thomasina\nand her tutor Septimus, fails to ignite.\nMuch of the comedy is lost, leaving\nthe script to fight for itself. To its\neternal credit, it succeeds, proving the\ntheory that it\u2019s impossible to make\na bad show out of Arcadia. It\u2019s just\npossible to do Arcadia badly.\nAnother scene change later, and\nI\u2019m starting to have second thoughts\nabout this production. Is it just my\npersonal bias, the intrinsic \u201cthis\nis how Arcadia should be done\u201d\nthat comes from directing it, or\nis something genuinely off with\nthis show? One glorious moment\nof physical comedy a second later,\nhowever, and suddenly I\u2019m sold.\nEveryone seems to wake up, and\neverything speeds up enough to\nrevive the play\u2019s flagging momentum.\nNakay Kpaka\u2019s Ezra Chater, the\nwould-be poet, finally becomes\nthe incompetent, flouncing comic\nrelief he\u2019s supposed to be. Faced\nwith a livelier companion than the\nsubdued Thomasina, Wilf Scolding\u2019s\nSeptimus comes alive, revelling in\nthe Byronesque wit of his character.\nEven the 1993 scene that follows\nfeels livelier, with Ria Zmitrowicz\u2019s\neffervescent Chloe Coverly standing\nin stark contrast to her counterpart\nfrom the past.\nThis recovery continues unimpeded\nby the interval, making for a far more\ncompetent second act, and meaning\nthe play feels like a much stronger\nproduction overall than the early\nmoments would suggest. When the\ncast settles, the majority find their\nroles and hit the notes just right,\nalthough there are enough miscast\nroles to unbalance the show and\nleave a distinctly wonky feeling. But\ntouring a show is always hard on any\ncast, and hopefully with a few more\nperformances (in front of some very\ndifferent audiences) the whole cast\nwill find their feet and be able to hit\nthe ground running every night.\nThis production of Arcadia, then,\nis very much a mixed bag. Gorgeous\nyet un-intrusive lighting design,\nminimalist (arguably to the point of\ndetriment) set design and adequate\nsound design combine with a\nmasterful script and various calibres\nof performance to produce something\nultimately watchable, and enjoyable,\nalbeit with some almost unbearable\nlow points. It\u2019s the embodiment\nof \u2018hit and miss\u2019, and at no point is\nthis more obvious than in the very\nlast moments. The play\u2019s soaring\nemotional crescendo, as Thomasina\nand Septimus waltz in the past to\nthe strains of modern-day music, is\nplayed perfectly and strikes exactly\nthe right tone \u2013 only to be undone by\nthe appearance of the other characters\nin the background, looking on. It\u2019s\nan artistic decision that feels slightly\noff, and undermines such an intimate\nmoment that was done so well. It\u2019s a\nhuge shame, as the bum note of the\nfinal moments can\u2019t help but taint the\ngood work that came before. This isn\u2019t\na bad production of Arcadia. It\u2019s just\nnot a very exciting one.\n\"When the\ncase settles,\nthe majority\nhit the notes\njust right,\nalthough\na wonky\nfeeling\nremains\"\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "18 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nScience Editor James Bezer & Lauren Ratcliffe\nScience\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nProfessor Robert Winston talks to James Bezer\nabout the vote to allow \u2018three-parent babies\u2019\n\u201cThis does not threaten\nthe fabric of our society\u201d\n\u201cThis does not threaten the\nfabric of our society in\nany way whatsoever: it\u2019s\nan individual choice for someone\nwho\u2019s watched a child die of a horrible\ndisease\u201d.\nFor Robert Winston, a pioneer of\nIVF and one of the country\u2019s most\nfamous doctors, the recent decision\nby the House of Lords to approve\nthe creation of babies using donated\nmitochondria was an emotive one.\n\u201cMost children with Leigh\u2019s\nsyndrome, for example, go floppy,\ngo blind, have fits, have steady brain\ndeterioration and die by the age of 2.\nThe few that survive will have muscle\nweakness and muscular dystrophy\nand blindness.\n\u201cThe one thing worse than losing\nyour own child is losing your own\nchild after a hideous disease.\u201d\nMitochondria are structures in\nevery cell that produce ATP, the\nmolecule that powers chemical\nreactions within the body. Genetic\nmutations, however, can cause\nmitochondria to work ineffectively,\ncausing these severe illnesses.\nIn the new technique approved by\nparliament, the nucleus of a fertilised\negg is removed and implanted in\nthe cytoplasm of a donor egg from a\nhealthy woman.\nIt\u2019s been described in the media as\ncreating \u201cthree-parent babies\u201d, but it\u2019s\nnot a term Winston especially likes.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve had a blood transfusion,\nI got far more foreign DNA in\nmy body than any \u2018three-parent\nbaby\u2019 would have, so the name is\nnonsense, obviously. Admittedly, it\u2019s\npermanent, but it\u2019s a permanent cure,\nunlike my blood transfusion, which\nwill only cure my anaemia for a few\nweeks\u201d.\nThe vote enjoyed broad support in\nthe Lords, passing with a majority of\n232. The decision has been severely\ncriticised by the Catholic church,\nhowever, and in the preceding\ndebate, several members criticised\nthe treatment for ethical and safety\nreasons, as well as for the speed with\nwhich the decision was being made.\nLord Winston was one of the most\nvocal supporters of the treatment\nin the debate, and was particularly\ncritical of those opposed on religious\ngrounds, and was keen to emphasise\nthe ethical principles that had\ninfluenced his decision.\n\u201cI think that in a pluralistic,\ndemocratic society, responsible\nindividuals should have their\nautonomy respected, and I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s any business of parliament\nto say: \u201cyes, you should have this\ntreatment\u201d or \u201cno, you can\u2019t have this\ntreatment\u201d.\n\u201cMy impression of the women\nwho want this treatment was that\nthey were requesting it because they\ndid not want to have a termination\nof pregnancy, because they thought\nthis was morally wrong, so it seems\nto me to be utterly wrong for a\nparliamentarian who\u2019s opposed to\nabortion, for example, to get up and\nimpose their view about somebody,\nwho doesn\u2019t want abortion either, but\nactually wants something which is a\nlesser injury, which is to get rid of the\ndamaged egg.\n\u201cThe mitochondrial diseases that\naffect child-bearing families are\nactually pretty rare, so this regulation\nwould only apply to a few families.\n\u201cEssentially, I think there are\nfour principles we must consider\nethically: one is the respect for the\nautonomy of the individual, who\u2019s\nrequesting something, and that\nmeans informed consent, so you\nlisten to their problems and you\nexplain the difficulties and the\ndangers to them, and that you respect\ntheir confidentially, which is quite\nimportant, and you respect their\nopinion. Now occasionally, of course,\nit might be that, for example if I was a\nreligious Catholic, I might disagree, in\nwhich case, the correct thing for me to\ndo would be to send them to another\ndoctor.\n\u201cThis is not a diatribe against\nCatholics. I deeply respect\nCatholicism, but I think nonetheless,\nit\u2019s important that we don\u2019t try and\nimpose our minority view. I\u2019m a Jew,\nand I wouldn\u2019t dream of imposing\na Jewish view on someone with\nmitochondrial disease. Actually\nthe Jewish view would be to treat\nthem, although I don\u2019t think many\nrabbi\u2019s have really spoken about it\nparticularly.\n\u201cSo the first thing is the autonomy,\nthe second thing is that it is\nencumbered upon us to be beneficent,\nto try to do good, and to my mind,\nif you can prevent a child dying\nhorribly, and having a healthy life\nin consequence, that\u2019s beneficent.\nThe main thing is not to do harm, so\nyou\u2019ve got to look at the side effects,\nand after the extensive research done\nin Newcastle, I\u2019m fairly happy that\nthe chances of serious side effects are\nmuch less than the benefits.\n\u201cLastly is the issue of justice: what\u2019s\nthe just solution for these people?\nThe just solution for them is to have\nthe treatment they think they need\u201d.\nDespite the vote, Winston says the\nfirst baby born in the UK through\nthis method is still a long way off.\n\u201cWhat will now happen is that\nany person who thinks that they\nmay have mitochondrial disease\nand doesn\u2019t want to watch their\nbaby die can apply to a unit that\u2019s\nprepared to do this treatment, and\nthis unit can then apply for a license\nto the regulatory authority, the\nHFEA (Human Fertilisation and\nEmbryology Authority).\n\u201cThat authority will take into\naccount a whole range of things\nincluding their expertise, the kind\nof research they\u2019ve done, the kind\nof precautions they\u2019ve taken and\nthey may or may not grant a license,\nbut it will probably be done on an\nindividual case by case basis.\u201d\nIn the late 90s, Jacques Cohen and\nhis team in New Jersey developed a\nsimilar technique to implant healthy\nmitochondria into embryos. They\nwere trying to allow older mothers\nwho had struggled to conceive a\nway to have healthy children. 17\nbabies were born, and while two had\nchromosomal defects, this may have\nbeen due to the age of the mother,\nrather than the treatment.\nDespite the early promising results,\nmitochondrial replacement has been\nbanned outright by the US Food\nand Drug Administration since\n2002 because of safety and ethical\nconcerns.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was the\nright decision,\u201d says Winston. \u201cI\nthink since then there\u2019s been a lot\nmore research into trying to do\nnuclear replacement and spindle\nreplacement in human embryos. The\nproblem, of course, is that there isn\u2019t\nan animal model for mitochondrial\ndisease, so you can\u2019t test this in a cow,\nfor example, and see whether it will\nhave an effect.\n\u201cOne of the issues I think about\nmitochondrial disease is that there\nmay be a nuclear DNA component,\nso these people with mitochondrial\ndisease might not only have\nmitochondrial mutations, but also\nmutations in the DNA of the nucleus,\nwhich you\u2019re not treating. So it could\nbe that they may be still affected by\nthe disease, but less so.\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s a risk of\nsomething going wrong with any\n\"The one\nthing\nworse than\nlosing your\nown child\nis losing\nthem after\na hideous\ndisease\"\n\"The name\n\u2018threeparent\nbaby\u2019 is\nnonsense.\"\nOne of the pioneers of fertility treatments, R\n\n"

Thankfully, the\nweather held for their first game\nagainst the Loughborough Thunder\nand the Falcons got off to a decent\nstart, opening the scoring with a run\ncoming in off a passed ball as lead-off\nhitter Ashley came round to score\nafter drawing a walk and stealing\ntwo bases. Centre fielder Chris and\nshortstop Edoardo also managed\nto get on base but were unlucky\nto get tagged out at home in two\nconsecutive plays before the inning\nended with left fielder Stephane\ngrounding out to shortstop. The\nlead was short-lived however as the\nThunder\u2019s return salvo at the bottom\nof the inning yielded four runs and\ngave them a commanding three run\nlead.\nThe Falcons failed to score in the\nsecond, despite right fielders Min and\nChris both drawing walks, as rookie\ndebutants Hriday and Zayd grounded\nout before Edoardo popped out to\nthe Thunder\u2019s catcher. The Falcons\nmade up for the abysmal hitting\nhowever with a strong defensive\ninning to hold the Thunder to single\nrun in the bottom of the second. The\nthird inning started off slowly with\npitcher Ben Hollis grounding out to\nshort. Rhys and Stephane however,\nmanaged to draw walks to get on base\nbefore stealing to third and second\nrespectively. With runners in scoring\nposition, the Falcons\u2019 rookies came\nout in a big way with two consecutive\nRBI hits to bring in 2 runs for the\nFalcons and make it a two-run ball\ngame.\nDespite the mounting pressure\nas the Falcons closed the lead, the\nThunder came out strongly in the\nbottom of the inning to score two\nruns of their own and re-establish\nthe four run lead. As the clock ran\ndown, the umpire announced that no\nmore new innings would be played.\nThis left the Falcons needing to\nscore four runs to stay in the game\nand Loughborough finally brought\non one of their more experienced\npitchers to close out the game.\nDespite the stronger pitching, the\nFalcons came out strongly as catcher\nAshley got on base off a walk and\neventually came round to score on\na passed ball after having stolen to\nthird. Chris then gave up the first out\nas he struck out swinging on a 1-2\ncount. Edoardo then drew a walk and\nstole second before taking third as\nBen got on base off a K-E2 (dropped\nstrike out ball). With one down, the\ntying run, Rhys \u201cThe Beast\u201d Jones\nstepped up to the plate and hit a\nline-drive between first and second\nto score Edoardo. Ben however was\ntagged out at home trying to close\nthe lead as Rhys made an ill-advised\nattempt to lengthen his single into\na double that resulted in an easy\ndouble play for the Thunder to close\nout the game and shutdown the\nFalcons\u2019 hopes of turning the game\naround.\nWith the score now at 7-5 to the\nThunder, the bottom of the inning\nwas played out due to the tiebreak\nrule, with Loughborough hoping\nto lengthen their lead and increase\ntheir run differential. This was\nnot to be however, as the Falcons\nfinally found their groove and shut\ndown the Thunder offense, holding\nthem to zero runs with two strike\nouts delivered by reliever Vincent\n\u201cDemon Pitcher\u201d Li.\nAs the Falcons took a 20 minute\nbreather before their next game\nagainst Nottingham, the first drops\nof the previously forecasted rain\nstarted to fall. As the game started,\nthe weather grew more menacing\nwith ever darker clouds closing in\non the skies above the field. Despite\nthe weather, the Falcons started\nstrongly off some strong pitching\nfrom their ace, Edoardo Lisi. They\nheld Nottingham to only one run\nbefore hitting a mercy rule inning\nto take a commanding 5-1 lead off\nconsecutive over-the-fence ground\nrule doubles from first baseman Ben\nand second baseman Rhys.\nAs the second inning came round,\nthe weather grew progressively\nworse and the Falcons slowly started\nto freeze. This was reflected in\ntheir fielding as the Falcons gave\nup three runs to allow the Thieves\nback into the game at a score of 5-4.\nFortunately, the lead wasn\u2019t the only\nthing to disappear in the inclement\nweather as the score sheet dissolved\nin the rain, taking away all record\nof the abysmal inning. The Falcons\noffense then failed to replicate their\nfirst inning success, scoring only\none run while giving up three easy\nouts to the Thieves. With the rain\nnow in full force, the Falcons offered\nto end the match then. However,\nthe northern-bred Thieves would\nnot give up, and banking on their\ncold-resistant northern blood,\nthey proceeded to hit in a mercy\nrule inning of their own to take a\ncommanding three run lead.\nThings were now looking dismal\nAshley Ng carries on from last week, reporting on the second day of the tournament\nfor the Falcons as they needed to\nscore three runs in the bottom\nhalf of the inning to tie the game.\nThe inning started off with Rhys\ngetting on base off a walk before\nVincent popped out to second.\nHe subsequently stole to third as\nStephane drew a walk to get on first.\nRhys then came home on a passed\nball to bring the Falcons within two\nruns as Stephane stole to third. The\nFalcons hope were dealt a huge blow\nhowever as rookie third baseman\nZayd was put out to bring the Thieves\nwithin one out of sealing the game.\nWith two outs, debutant right fielder\nHriday stepped up to the plate and\ndrew the walk to load the tying run\non first and bring the Falcons back to\nthe top of the line-up. With the tying\nrun at the plate, the tension was\npalpable as Hriday stole second to\nput the tying run in scoring position.\nThe Falcons\u2019 shortstop then hit a\nblistering line-drive that careened\noff the left field fence and scored\nStephane to bring the Falcons within\none run of tying the game.\nWith Hriday on third, centre\nfielder Chris took the strike to let\nAshley steal second and get the\nwinning run in scoring position. A\nmissed swing later, the Thieves were\nnow one strike away from ending the\ngame and the intensity could be felt\nthroughout the pitch. As the fateful\npitch left the pitcher\u2019s fingers all\neyes were on Chris as he turned and\nbrought the bat to bear. The next few\nmoments would come to highlight\nthe Falcons\u2019 M1ST experience as the\nhard-hit line-drive sailed over the\nThieves short stop and dropped for\na single. With Hriday safely home\nand the game tied, Ashley rounded\nthird without breaking pace and\nwent full speed into home plate to\nscore the fourth run and take the\ngame for the Falcons. With the game,\nand third place safely in the bag, the\nFalcons then rushed to pack their\nequipment before making a beeline\nfor the warmth and dryness of the\nLoughborough University Fitness\nCentre to celebrate their emphatic\nvictory in what was effectively a\nthird place playoff.\nDespite losing out on a spot in the\nfinal by only two runs, the Falcons\nwill take a lot of positives from\nthis competition with the strong\nperformances of debutants Hriday\nand Zayd as well as greatly improved\nhitting from the team in general.\nWith these encouraging signs,\nthe Falcons will train even harder\nover the next month and return\nto the Spring Cup with the aim of\nfinally bringing home that coveted\nchampionship trophy.\nPhoto: Baseball Softball UK\nPhoto: IC Baseball\n\n"

    "content": "56 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nJingjie Cheng explores the interaction between art and science\nAn Ode to Medicine, Mortality, and Art\nIn his poem Larynx, Pablo Neruda\nimplored of Death:\nWhy are you following me?\nWhat do you want with my skeleton?...\nWhy do you have to take me?\nWhat business have I with Heaven?\nHell doesn\u2019t suit me \u2013\nI feel fine on the earth.\u201d\nThe anxiety of the speaker upon\nlearning of a possible laryngeal\ntumour \u2013 \u201ca small seed of death\u201d \u2013\nspeaks for any patient who discovers\nhe has a serious illness. The fear,\ndenial, rage, the stubborn will to live\n(\u201cI wanted to be a cyclist | to pedal\nout of death\u2019s range\u201d) reflects more\nabout human nature than it does\nof the science of medicine itself: it\nis the human nature which is about\nstanding up against trying times that\nart so often attempts to capture.\nNeruda, who is far better known\nfor his passionate love poetry than\nruminations on mortality, is only one\nof thousands of artists and writers\nwho have based their creative works\non medicine and the art of healing.\nLove and death, medicine and art,\nare not greatly different after all \u2013\nhistory is replete with examples of\nmarriages between art and medicine,\nfrom Da Vinci\u2019s Vitruvian Man to\nRembrandt\u2019s famous painting of\nThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicholaes\nTulp, now almost an icon of medical\neducation. Illness, struggle, healing,\nand death make profound and\npersonal subject matter for creativity,\nbut there is also the simple aesthetic\nappreciation of the human body\nboth in health and in illness \u2013 an\nexternalised observation of our\ninherent vulnerability.\nThere is a Mandarin saying that\nsums up life as \u201cbirth, age, illness,\nand death\u201d, painting a picture of life\nas basically a gradual submission to\nthe forces of age and disease. Perhaps\nit is this universality of sickness and\nhealing that makes medicine such a\npopular inspiration for artists, more\nso than any other profession. We all\nunderstand it; we see it in our own\nbodies, in the struggles of loved ones,\nand in the work of doctors.\nI picked up a book recently titled\nThe Sick Rose: Disease and the Art\nof Medical Illustration, a display\nof exquisite, unsettling drawings\nof sickness from the Wellcome\nCollection. Created in the time\nbefore colour photography, most\nof the drawings were done with the\npurpose of educating physicians\nof the past, rather than as creative\nworks. But any viewer would be able\nto appreciate the skill that went into\nthem. To me, the crystallization of a\ndisease, something so dynamic, into\na particular representative drawing,\nis creative interpretation in and\nof itself. Call it perhaps a morbid\nfascination, but I think the appeal of\nthese medical illustrations lie in an\ninnate drive to understand ourselves.\nLooking at all the hair-raising\ndiseases staring almost too placidly\nfrom the pages reminds me of how\nimpermanent health and youth is,\nand how powerless our bodies are in\nthe face of such ravages.\nThus, in appreciating the aesthetics\nof health, I find that there is beauty\nin how basic chemical molecules\ncome together to form a sentient\nbeing. Where there is beauty, there is\nart. The New Objectivity movement\nin photography, for example, focused\non capturing nature for its objective\nbeauty divorced from any sentiment.\nPerhaps the aesthetics of the human\nbody holds similar sway.\nYet, despite its objective fascinating\nqualities, in the past disease and the\nhuman body make such attractive\nartistic inspiration perhaps also\nbecause of its unknowability. Disease\nmight have been represented as bad\nspirits swirling around patients, or\ndemons trying to break free. Our\nknowledge of disease increases by\nthe day and such representations,\nfar from dying out, simply become\nmetaphors. We can understand\nperfectly that infections, poor diet,\nor wayward cells cause disease, but\nthat doesn\u2019t stop us from seeing\nour ageing and weakening bodies\nas an affliction on ourselves as a\nwhole rather than in the scientific\nmechanisms of disease.\nIn a scathing criticism of the\nmedical profession\u2019s obsession with\ncutting things up and in the process\ndehumanizing medicine, Dannie\nAbse, a British physician-poet-playwright himself, writes in his\npoem X-ray :\nSome prowl sea-beds, some hurtle to a\nstar\nand, mother, some obsessed turn over\nevery stone\nor open graves to let that starlight in.\nThere are men who would open anything.\nHarvey, the circulation of the blood,\nand Freud, the circulation of our dreams,\npried honourably and honoured are\nlike all explorers. Men who\u2019d open men.\nThere is somehow a sanctity of the\nhuman body that makes one averse\nto breaking it all down, and it is this\nwholeness that art captures. The nuts\nand bolts of disease may very well be\nleft to science, but afflictions of the\nbody is more than that; it affects the\nperson, and that is the void that art\nfills.\nMedicine is so crucial to society;\nit is also an institution, especially\nin modern times. Thus, more than\njust inspiring art on a personal level,\nmedicine and healthcare institutions\nhave also inspired social and political\ncommentary in art. What is disease?\nWhat is madness? What is sanity? In\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, Ken\nKesey questions what madness is,\ncriticising the medical profession\u2019s\nmonopoly over its definition. Art\nallows us to stand in the shoes of\nothers, and good art allows us to\nunderstand different points of view\nvividly \u2013 crucial in attacking the\nstatus quo.\nLast month, I caught Nina Raine\u2019s\nrevival of her 2011 play Tiger Country\n\u2013 a snapshot of life in the NHS\nwith everything that was wrong\nthrown in. \u201cTiger country\u201d refers\nto dangerous situations in surgery\nwhere the surgeon knows that a\nslip would cause death. In the play,\nthe whole hospital is tiger country\nfor those trying to navigate it. As\na medical student, watching it was\nutterly depressing, but I must admit\nthat it was a fantastic and timely\npoking-of-holes in the NHS. Clearly,\ntheatre was a very immediate way of\nprovoking discussion on our over-stretched healthcare system and the\nworking environment our healthcare\nworkers have to deal with.\nI have never been able to decide\nwhether I am more of a \u201cscience\nperson\u201d or an \u201carts person\u201d \u2013 a\nline people often like to draw \u2013 but\nI think being able to appreciate\nthe relationship between the two\nmakes life a lot richer. Perhaps\nmedicine and disease make ripe\ncreative material precisely because it\nstraddles the middle ground between\nthe two worlds, a space of multiple\npossibilities and fresh ideas. More\nthan that, I also think that it is our\nundying obsession with our own\nmortality that elicits such varied and\nfascinating artistic exploration. I am\nof the opinion that art actually has\nsomething to contribute to our larger\nunderstanding of medicine as a whole\nas much as medicine provides for\nartistic inspiration. After all, as the\nancient Greek physician Hippocrates\nwrote, \u201cLife is short, and art long\u201d\n\u2013 we will always be transient beings\ndespite the medical profession\u2019s best\nefforts, but art immortalizes this\nvery human struggle.\nThe Scalpel 2, Barbara Hepworth, 1949 Photo: Tate\n\u201cThere is\nsomehow a\nsanctity of\nthe human\nbody that\nmakes one\naverse to\nbreaking it\ndown\u201d\n\"Art allows\nus to stand\nin the\nshoes of\nothers \u2013\ncrucial in\nattacking\nthe status\nquo\"\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "62 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nTom Stoppard: Not so Hard After All\nTom Stoppard\u2019s latest play has\nbeen a long time coming. His\nlast work to grace the stage\nwas 2006\u2019s Rock and Roll at The\nRoyal Court \u2013 and his last work at\nthe National Theatre was four years\nbefore that, with The Coast of Utopia\nin 2002. Nine years since his last play.\nTo call expectations high might just\nbe an understatement.\nEarly signs are promising. The play\nis shaping up to be quintessentially\nStoppard, blending meaningful\ndiscussions of complex scientific\nideas with eloquence and wit. Where\nArcadia tackled the second law of\nthermodynamics, and Rosencrantz\nand Guildenstern are Dead dealt with\nexistentialism and free will, The\nHard Problem turns to the notion of\nconsciousness.\nThe titular Hard Problem (capitals\nwholly necessary \u2013 as one character\nexplains, \u201cwe do brain science.\nThere is only one Hard Problem.\u201d)\nis one of explaining consciousness,\nexplaining our first person, subjective\nexperiences, phenomena such as\ncolour or taste. In the programme\nnotes, Stoppard credits the Australian\nphilosopher David Chalmers for\nthe phrase \u2013 as would most of the\ninternet \u2013 although he acknowledged\nin a later interview that he \u201cmight\nas well have credited Leibnitz\u201d for\ncoining the term.\nThere\u2019s an added incentive to be\nhopeful in the form of the location\nfor Stoppard\u2019s return to the stage: the\nDorfman Theatre at the National. A\nredevelopment of the old Cottesloe\nTheatre, it\u2019s a wonderfully versatile\nspace, offering multiple possibilities\nfor staging.\nAdd in the fact it\u2019s directed by\nNicholas Hytner, in his last show\nat the National before departing as\nits Director, and the anticipation is\nalmost unbearable.\nAt first glance, the set design\ndoes little to reward or spurn that\nanticipation. A collection of vertical\nbars, entangled in a mess of wires,\nloom over an empty stage. The first\nscene rapidly reveals how this is going\nto play out from a visual perspective,\nas a minimalist approach to set\ndesign evokes the settings rather than\noutright stating them.\nA bed and a desk comprise a\nbedroom, some chairs and a coffee\ntable indicate a waiting room, and\nso on. Bar the occasional use of a\nbackdrop, it\u2019s left to a few items of\nfurniture and the work of the actors\nParth Thakerar as Amal, the arrogant\ndriven rival to Hilary for a job at the\nKrole Institute for Brain Science.\nThe character\u2019s interactions provide\nthe show with momentum that isn\u2019t\nnecessarily provided by the plot itself.\nIt\u2019s a surprisingly straightforward\naffair \u2013 still well put-together,\ncertainly, but nowhere near as\nmeticulously composed as the likes of\nArcadia.\nStoppard admitted in interviews\nthat he adopted a tactic akin to\n\u201cwrite and see where it goes\u201d for (at\nleast parts of) The Hard Problem, in\ncontrast to the extensive mapping-out of previous plays. It makes\nfor an interesting experience,\nas the play runs for a hundred\nuninterrupted minutes, providing a\nmore streamlined and brisk Stoppard\nexperience. The content and general\nstyle may not have changed, but\nthe overall form has, and it\u2019s no bad\nthing.\nDoes The Hard Problem match up to\nthe expectations piled upon it by its\nvery nature? Easily. There were a few\ndesign choices that felt slightly off \u2013\nthe scene change music in particular\nhad a nasty habit of either starting\nlate or running on for too long \u2013 but\nnothing that actually harmed the\nshow.\nStoppard\u2019s latest play is another\ngem, quite possibly his best since\nArcadia (it always comes back to that,\ndoesn\u2019t it?), and the director and cast\nthat have been enlisted to bring it to\nlife do an impeccable job. As Stoppard\nhimself put it, \u201cI think the play\u2019s been\ndone really, really well.\u201d\nThe Hard Problem is on at the\nNational Theatre\u2019s Dorfman Theatre\nuntil 27th\nMay. Tickets from \u00a315.\nOlvia Vinall (Hilary) and Anthony Calf (Jerry) in Tom Stoppard\u2019s The Hard Problem Photo: Johan Persson\nJack Steadman wraps his head around the playwright\u2019s latest\n\"I think the\nplay\u2019s been\ndone really,\nreally well.\"\n\"We do\nbrain\nscience.\nThere\nis only\none Hard\nProblem.\"\nto suggest the setting \u2013 and it\u2019s to the\ncredit of all involved that it works\nwonderfully. The design allows\nfor the play to focus on Stoppard\u2019s\ntypically glorious dialogue, forcing\nthe attention onto his words and the\nactors delivering them, rather than\ntheir surroundings.\nThe bars and wires hanging over\nthe stage turn out to be a touch\nmore exciting than just a mysterious\nsculpture, coming to life in the scene\nchanges. As classical music plays over\nthe darkness, the bars and wires pulse,\nflickering with the music. It\u2019s clearly\nintended to evoke images of brain\nactivity, but mostly it just comes\nacross as a pretty light show.\nThe rest of the play\u2019s dealings\nwith brain activity are somewhat\nmore effective. The opening gambit\nis classic misdirection, as tutor\nSpike (Damien Molony) tells Hilary\n(Olivia Vinall) \u201cyou\u2019re looking at two\nyears. The jewellery was under the\nfloorboards. The police have nothing\nto connect you to the scene of the\nrobbery.\u201d\nAs the discussion unfolds, it\u2019s\nrevealed they\u2019re talking about the\n\u2018Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma\u2019, a psychology\nscenario that Hilary attempts to\ndeconstruct. It\u2019s immediately,\nclassically Stoppard, discussing\nhigh concepts in an engaging \u2013 and\nsupremely enjoyable \u2013 manner.\nThe cast are having a ball playing\nwith Stoppard\u2019s dialogue to boot,\nand it\u2019s that which really helps the\nshow succeed. Vinall thrives as\nHilary, graduating from leading\nroles in Shakespeare (Cordelia and\nDesdemona in King Lear and Othello,\nrespectively) to what could arguably\nbe called the modern-day equivalent.\nOther standouts are Damien\nMolony as the charming Spike, and\nOlivia Vinall (Hilary) and Damien Molony (Spike).

Luckily,these\nbody positivity movements have\nhad an overwhelming response,and\nmillions of women all over the world\nare starting to embrace their bodies\nand show them off,instead of hiding\nthem away.\nOver the last few years,the high\nstreet has started to catch on to the\nvast demand for more interesting\nitems,and many brands such as\nAsos,New Look,and Forever 21\nhave launched ranges that allow\nwomen to find the pieces that they\nwant to wear,and let them have the\nfreedom of choice of what to put on\ntheir body.While the choice doesn\u2019t\ncome close to that of\u201cstraight\nfashion\u201d(regular sizes),it\u2019s getting\nbetter every day,and there is much\nless shame associated with buying\nclothes in larger sizes.\nBut the world of high-end fashion\nis lagging behind.There is still\ndiscrimination among high-end\ndesigners and retailers,and while\nsome are starting to welcome\nplus-size women as customers\nand models,the world of high-end fashion largely remains an\nunfriendly and inaccessible place for\nTess Munster, also known as Tess\nHolliday, has recently become\nthe largest model ever to be\nsigned to a major modelling agency,\nMiLK Model Management.

Now she is one of the\nmost famous plus-size models in\nthe world, with a huge following on\nInstagram. However, she experiences\na vicious backlash on social media in\nresponse to each post, which accuses\nher of promoting an unhealthy\nlifestyle. Throughout this, Tess is an\nunfailingly positive presence on the\ninternet.\nShe regularly hosts events all\nover the world to help women with\ntheir personal body acceptance.

Published by the music\nblog Crack In The Road, it makes for\na grim indication of the modern\nmusic industry; a wealth of band\nnames has instead become a sea of\nvibrant yellow, like an garish alarm\nwarning us, \u201cthere is a problem\u201d. This\nyear, 89.6% of the festival\u2019s lineup\nconsists of solo men, or all-male\nbands; remarkably, this isn\u2019t actually\nthat bad \u2013 feminist organisation\nfemale:pressure, a collective of\nmusicians and artists pushing for\nequality, have stated that \u201cnowadays,\na 10% proportion of female artists\ncan be considered above average\u201d.\nAlthough we are now 15 years into\nthe new millennium, it seems that\nfestival organisers, music promoters,\nand \u2013 indeed \u2013 many arts journalists\nare still stuck in the last century.\nHowever, this isn\u2019t seen as a\nproblem by Melvin Benn. Current\nmanaging director of Festival\nRepublic, the UK music promoter\nwho organises Reading and Leeds\nfestivals, Benn has denied the idea\nthat music festivals have a problem\nwith women artists. \u201cThe idea that\nfemale bands are sidelined is just not\nthere,\u201d he said to Gigwise earlier this\nyear. \u201cGone are the days where a band\nwas four guys. It\u2019s genuinely gone.\u201d\nAnd so why does his festival only\nfeature 3 women-only acts, out of a\nlineup of nearly one hundred?\nMany defenders of such practices\nhave argued that there is an inherent\nproblem with the genre of \u2018rock\u2019\nas a whole, and festival promoters\ncan\u2019t feature woman-lead guitar\nmusic if there simply isn\u2019t any.\nAside from the fact that there are\ninnumerable incredible women\nguitarists working currently (Annie\nClark, anyone? Anna Calvi?), such\nan argument just reminds me of\ndefences of Rockism, that mating call\nof the NME journalist that strives\nfor \u2018authenticity\u2019, only insofar as\nthat translates to \u2018white, straight\nmen with guitars\u2019. In his seminal\ncritique of this industry bias, The Rap\nAgainst Rockism, journalist Kelefa\nSanneh argued that Rockism actually\namounts to little more than an excuse\nfor sexism, racism, and homophobia.\n\u201c[Rockism] reduces Rock and Roll to\na caricature, then uses that caricature\nas a weapon... could it really be a\ncoincidence that rockist complaints\noften pit straight white men against\nthe rest of the world?\u201d\nWhen it comes to how the music\nindustry, I feel that Benn would\ndo well to listen to actual female\nmusicians, such as Icelandic artist\nBjork; in an interview with Pitchfork\nearlier this year, the creative auteur\nlamented the bias against women\nwithin the industry, mentioning\nmultiple instances where her work\nshe had done was credited to male\nproducers. \u201cI want to support young\ngirls who are in their 20s now. You\u2019re\nnot just imagining things,\u201d she said,\n\u201cEverything that a guy says once, you\nhave to say five times.\u201d\nBjork, whose achievements are too\nmany to list but include 14 Grammy\nAward nominations, a Cannes Film\nFestival prize for Best Actress, and an\nupcoming Museum of Modern Art\nretrospective of her 30-year career,\nhas carved out a space for herself in a\ngenre that is, perhaps, most open to\ngifted women wanting to make music\non their own terms: experimental\nelectronica. Although the genre\u2019s\nopenness towards women may be\nexplained by the fact that anyone\nwith a laptop can produce music now,\nthe relationship between women and\nelectronica actually runs far deeper,\nall the way back to the 19th\nCentury,\nand Ada Lovelace.\nLovelace, often described as the\nworld\u2019s first computer programmer,\nworked on Charles Babbage\u2019s\nAnalytical Engine; her notes describe\nwhat is now known as the first\nalgorithm designed to be carried out\nby a machine, and pointed out a flaw\nin Babbage\u2019s equations, making her\nthe world\u2019s first debugger. Described\nby Babbage as the \u201cEnchantress of\nNumbers\u201d, she saw the potential\nfor computers to be used as a social,\ncollaborative tool, as opposed to\nmerely a means of calculation.\nIn her notes, she speculated that\ncomputers may \u201ccompose elaborate\n\"The\nrelationship\nbetween\nwomen and\nelectronica\nruns back\nto the 19th\nCentury\"\nPortrait of British computing mastermind Ada Loveleace.

In fact, Kubrick had a strong\nrelationship with the electronic\nmusic scene, enlisting composer\nWendy Carlos to perform the scores\nfor two of his most popular films: A\nClockwork Orange and The Shining.\nCarlos became well known for her\nalbum Switched-On Bach; first released\nin 1968, the album consisted of JS\nBach pieces performed on the then-novel Moog synthesizer, and helped\ncontribute to a significant interest\nin electronic music. It evidently\ncaptured the public\u2019s imagination,\nbecoming one of the first classical\nmusic albums to sell over 500,000\ncopies and picking up three Grammy\nAwards along the way.\nThe 1970s saw an explosion of\ninterest in electronic composition.\nIt was during this time that Laurie\nSpiegel gained invaluable experience\nin electronics, working for audio\nsynthesiser laboratories. Spiegel\u2019s\nwork is beautifully intricate,\ngenerated using complex algorithms,\nand in 1977 her interpretation of\nJohannes Kepler\u2019s Harmonices Mundi\nbecame the opening track of the\ngolden record sent off in the Voyager\nspacecraft. In August 2012 Voyager I\npassed into interstellar space, making\nSpiegel one of the furthest reaching\ncomposers in human history.\nWhat all these women had in\ncommon was a strong academic\nbackground, something that is\nunderstandable considering the\nprohibitive cost of early synthesizers,\nwhich meant that only large\ninstitutions were able to afford them.\nThe fact that educational equality\ndid not enter into US public law until\nthe Women\u2019s Educational Equity Act\nwas passed in 1974 only makes the\nachievements of these composers all\nthe more impressive.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t only in America that\nthe relationship between women and\nelectronics was fruitful; in 1958, at the\nrequest of composer Daphne Oram,\nthe BBC Radiophonic Workshop was\nfounded to provide compositions\nand sound effects. Oram set up\non her own after less than a year,\nestablishing her own studio where she\nperfected the \u2018Oramics\u2019 technique, in\nwhich drawings on cellophane film\nare translated into abstract electronic\ncompositions. Oram\u2019s mantle would\nbe taken on by Delia Derbyshire,\nwho transferred to the Radiophonic\nWorkshop in 1962 and a year later\nproduced the iconic theme tune for\n\"What these\nwomen\ncomposers\nhad in\ncommon\nwas a strong\nacademic\nbackground\"\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "46 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nKunal Bhanot explores what the term \u2018jazz\u2019 really means to us today\nJazz: A Revolutionary Chapter In Music\nLook up the word \u2018jazz\u2019 in the\ndictionary and you come to\nfind a whole host of definitions\nranging from \u201ca type of American\nmusic with lively rhythms\u201d to\n\u201cmeaningless or foolish talk\u201d or\nindeed anything in between. If we\nstick with the former definition, jazz\ncould be assumed to have its roots\nin ragtime music, whereas with the\nlatter we are left to question whether\njazz should be confined to a sole\ngenre within the realms of music.\nSome of us, for instance, imply that\n\u2018jazzing\u2019 something up is the process\nof making it more interesting. Be\nit in a musical sense or not, jazz\nfundamentally reflects the art of\nspontaneity, an art that gained\npopularity at the beginning of the\n20th\ncentury.\nThis is not to say that master\nimprovisers did not exist in the 1800s:\nquite the opposite in fact. The likes\nof JS Bach were known to perform\nencores lasting for hours with no\nwritten music in sight. Come forward\n100 years from this and you\u2019d\nstill find the likes of Liszt altering\nChopin\u2019s themes to his own liking,\nalbeit angering him in the process.\nBased on our earlier definitions\nwe could therefore argue that jazz\nhas its roots in classical music even\nthough the improvisational art form\nwas hindered by the dominance of\ncompositional music at the time.\nWhat is it then that has led us to\nbelieve that jazz was born in the 20th\ncentury with ragtime? For me, it\nlies with the fact that ragtime was\na form that allowed musicians to\ncongregate and perform with fewer\nrestrictions that written music may\nhave unintentionally placed on\nthem. It comes as no surprise that\nmusicians who were unversed in\nreading music formed the foundation\nof this \u2018birth\u2019. Their musical ideas\nwere largely developed through\nthe process of combining western\nharmonic ideas with traditional\nAfrican rhythms. A main theme may\nhave been evident, such as that in\nJoplin\u2019s \u2018The Entertainer\u2019, but this\ncould be altered in numerous ways,\nakin to traditional call-and-response\ndrumming rhythms found in early\nAfrican music. The regular use of\nsyncopation in ragtime gave a taste of\nwhat was to come \u2013 greater freedom\nin expression, be it rhythmically,\nmelodically, or harmonically.\nThere is a reason, however, that\nwritten music had prevailed for so\nlong. After all, the sense of familiarity\nin a melody or harmonic structure\ngives music its appeal, one could\nargue. This is certainly true to some\nextent; a melody that is memorable\ngives a piece of music a sense of\nidentity, but repeat an idea for too\nlong and you\u2019ll soon find the listener\nin a state of boredom. On the other\nhand, if you\u2019re presented with a\nparticular melody but don\u2019t return\nto it, you leave finding yourself\nuninterested, no matter how brilliant\nthe compositional or improvisational\ntechniques used. Jazz has lessened\nthe degree of predictability in music\nand has given way to innovations in\nmusic that leaves the listener wanting\nmore. Where a Beethoven symphony\nmay be satisfying to listen to multiple\ntimes, we subconsciously learn that\nthe motifs within the piece will not\nchange whether it is played today or\ntomorrow.\nThe only varying factor in the\nperformance is the technical ability\nof the performer and his or her\nemotional interpretation of the piece.\nThis is one aspect of classical music\nthat has remained unchanged for\nmany years, and perhaps \u2018jazzing\u2019 it\nup from time to time wouldn\u2019t do it\nany harm. As talented as they are,\nmany classical musicians of today\nare so intent on achieving technical\nperfection that they lose the essence\nof creativity \u2013 something that Chopin\nand his contemporaries seemed to\nhave in abundance.\nThe pursuit of technical excellence\nis a noble one however \u2013 a lack\nof proficiency on your chosen\ninstrument could quite easily\nlead to a lack of expression. Great\njazz pianists such as Bill Evans\nwere classically trained from the\nbeginning, which gave them a\ntechnical foundation that comes\nthrough so beautifully in their Jazz\nplaying. This leads me to talk about\nOscar Peterson \u2013 perhaps the most\ntechnically gifted jazz pianist ever\nto have lived. It is a well-known fact\nthat Peterson would sit at the piano\nfrom 4 to 6 hours a day, with a large\nproportion of this time devoted to\ntechnical advancement through\nmeticulous attention to scales and\narpeggios.\nWhat he did so well though,\ncontrary to many accomplished\nclassical pianists of today, was\nchallenge himself musically with\nthese technical exercises. The result\nof this was a breath-taking display of\nvirtuosity and creativity that wowed\naudiences across the world. From\nhis freakishly fast runs down the\npiano, to his subtle reharmonisations\nof popular standards, Peterson was\na fine example of how jazz gave\nmusicians an extra dimension to their\nplaying. The art of improvisation\nwould give great jazz musicians such\nas Peterson the ability to let their\nemotions fuse with the music, which\nin turn gave every performance its\nown unique touch. For Peterson, this\nstayed true throughout his life, as an\nunfortunate stroke in his later years\ndid not prevent him from performing\nsolely with his right hand. In fact,\nmany (including myself) would\nstill argue that a one handed Oscar\nwas better than his two handed\ncontemporaries!\nSo the 20th\ncentury certainly saw\njazz\u2019s rise in popularity. Whether\nit was the two-step genius of Scott\nJoplin or the unparalleled virtuosity\nof Oscar Peterson, jazz gave rise\nto a greater degree of spontaneity\nin music. Where is jazz in 2015\nthen? In a good place, it seems. I\nwas fortunate enough to see Cuban\ntrumpeter Arturo Sandeval at Ronnie\nScott\u2019s recently, only to be stunned\nby his wonderful command of his\ninstrument across a wide array of\nstyles, ranging from modern funk\nto traditional Cuban folk. Based on\nthis, jazz could almost be considered\nto be too broad to be a \u2018genre\u2019 as such.\nInstead, we should look at it as a\nlicence to express oneself, even if it is\nin the context of Bach\u2019s counterpoint\nmelodies written many hundred\nyears ago.\nNo matter what your trade as a\nmusician, keeping things jazzy can\nonly be a good thing.\n\"Many\nclassical\nmusicians\nof today\nhave\nlost the\nessence of\ncreativity.\"\n\"Peterson\nwas a fine\nexample\nof how\njazz gave\nmusicians\nan extra\ndimension\nto their\nplaying.\"\nCredit: Pablo Records\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

Forever popping Vicodin\npills in his mouth as though they\nwere tic-tacs, in later series House\nbegins to blur the boundary between\nphysical and emotional pain, at one\npoint justifying his substance abuse\nto Wilson by saying, \u201cthe pain doesn\u2019t\ndiscriminate and neither do the pills.\u201d\nHis actions become more radical and\nlead to stints in both a psychiatric\nhospital and a prison. It would be\nfair to say that House is more of\na meditation on misery or a deep\ncharacter study of a compromised\ngenius than it is a medical procedural\ndrama.\nHouse himself is an enigma. His\nbrain means everything to him\nand he has recognised that solving\nobscure medical cases somehow\nlessens the chronic pain in his leg \u2013\nas though he were too busy with the\npuzzle to think about his physical\nvulnerabilities. While House portrays\nhimself as very lazy, he often goes\nout of his way to prove a point or be\nin control; he rarely takes the path\nof least resistance and is always his\nown worst enemy. House is reluctant\nto form relationships because\nit makes him vulnerable and is\nconstantly evading and deflecting in\nconversations. He tends to make light\nof morbid situations and never fully\nopens up to communicate honestly\nwith those around him. This means\nthat despite his inner demons, House\nis often very funny.\nForever trying to escape his clinic\nhours \u2013 where he actually has to\nmeet patients face to face \u2013 House\nalso generally avoids visiting his\nnon-clinic patients, since he believes\nthat removing emotional biases\nand keeping objectivity makes him\na better doctor, an opinion not\ndisproved on the show. The short\nclinic scenes, however, provide light\nrelief and make great use of Hugh\nLaurie\u2019s comedic sensibilities \u2013 the\nseries will make you laugh more\nthank you might think, largely due\nto the hugely satisfying \u2018Houseisms\u2019\nthat grace the series. In one episode\nan inspector remarks, \u201cDr. House, I\u2019ve\nheard your name.\u201d to which he replies\n\u201cMost people have, it\u2019s also a noun.\u201d\nIn one confrontation over a colleague,\nHouse tells Cuddy \u201cI don\u2019t want to say\nanything bad about another doctor...\nespecially a useless drunk.\u201d\nHouse has an uncanny ability to\n\u2018read\u2019 people and diagnose their\nailments simply by looking at them;\nthis talent is just one of the many\nsimilarities between House and the\nfictional detective Sherlock Holmes.\nHouse\u2019s intelligence, deductive\nreasoning skills, social awkwardness\nand powers of observation are near\nidentical to Sherlock\u2019s. Furthermore,\nboth House and Sherlock play\ninstruments, take drugs and have one\ntrue friend (Wilson/Watson). House\neven lives in flat 221B, essentially\nmaking the series a modern day\nSherlock, albeit with a medical degree.\nIt is often the case that actors do\na great job in their roles, and it is\neasy for the compliments made\nabout their achievements to lose\ntheir punch, but it has to be noted\nthat Hugh Laurie puts in a truly\nmesmerising performance as House.\nAs discussed above, the titular\ncharacter is one of the most nuanced\nand demanding parts that has ever\nbeen played on the small screen, and\nLaurie delivers in full.\nHugh Laurie has said that when he\nfirst read an early sample of the script\nhe instantly felt that he understood\nthis cranky doctor. Assuming that,\ndue to House\u2019s personality and\nconversational style that, he was\nplanned to be a \u201cquirky\u201d side member\nof the cast, it came as a surprise to\nLaurie that House\u2019s life, work, and\nopinions were in fact the whole\nfoundation of the show.\nDavid Shore explained that when\nhe and others got hold of Laurie\u2019s\nfive minute audition tape, one of the\nexecutive producers said, \u201cSee, this is\nwhat I want; an American guy.\u201d This\nis impressive in itself, but even more\nso when you consider that Hugh is in\nfact about as quintessentially British\nas it is possible to be.\nThe rest of the cast put in a\nuniversally top rate performance\nand the quality of the writing never\ndropped. The scripts remained as\nwitty and thought provoking as they\nwere at the beginning, an incredible\nachievement when you consider the\nsheer number of episodes.\nThis series was nothing if not\nbold, being one of the first television\nseries to put an anti-hero as the main\nprotagonist. Before the turn of the\ncentury the vast majority of leading\nmen and women were depicted\nas moral supermen. House wasn\u2019t\nthe first, but it was certainly one\nof the very best shows to embrace\nthe idea of having a leading role\nthat on paper the audience should\ndislike, if not actively hate. House\u2019s\ncharacter was a controversial figure,\nsteadfastly holding views that were\nnot all that popular and often taboo.\nBut the show\u2019s success has led to the\nmainstream adoption of this new\ndirection for television; we have seen\na huge influx of more conflicted,\ndamaged and all round realistic\ncentral performances ever since\nHouse\u2019s premiere way back in 2004.\nThe quality of television has never\nbeen higher than it is now and House\nis one of the shows that forged the\npath towards this exciting new era.\nWhen the producers announced\nthat the eighth series was going to be\nthe last, fans were not demanding for\nthe show to continue \u2013 instead, many\nof them were appreciative. Despite\nadoring the characters and the\nconcept, the audience recognised that\nit was time for people to move onto\nnew projects. Millions of people were\nheavily invested in House and wanted\nclosure. Some went as far to say that\nHouse should not have continued\npast the sixth series, as it had lost\nits freshness and sense of humour.\nRegardless, the show\u2019s commitment\nto character development gave House\na limited shelf life.\nThe pilot episode was titled\n\u2018Everybody Lies\u2019, a phrase that is\nuttered countless times throughout\nthe eight seasons that make up this\nnuanced medical procedural drama;\nthe final episode was appropriately\ntitled \u2018Everybody Dies\u2019.\nA hospital whodunit with a twist,\nHouse\u2019s enlightened cynicism and\naddictive tendencies made him\nan endearing character that you\nempathise with. This series was\namongst the most thought provoking\nand intelligent pieces of television\nin recent history and there is over\n125 hours of it to experience. All\ntold, House was a hugely successful\nand influential medical drama that\ndeserves to be watched. Even if\nits ideas are never executed to the\nsame exceptional standard, House\u2019s\ntelevision legacy will be felt for a long\ntime to come.\nAll eight series of House are now\navailable on Netflix.\n\"House is\none of the\nshows that\nforged\nthe path\ntowards this\nnew era of\nTV\"\nThe cast of House (L-R): Jesse Spencer, Olivia Wilde, Hugh Laurie, Robert Sean Leonard, Lisa\nEdelstein, and Omar Epps Photo: FOX\nCulture\nCelebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

Its aim is\nto put into space a camera with the\nhighest resolution of any CubeSat to\ndate, at 1.5m of the Earth\u2019s surface\nper pixel.\nIts ultimate goal is to be able to\naid search and rescue missions\nby detecting and locating distress\nsignals. There is currently a network\nof satellites to designed for this\npurpose, but these were developed\nin the seventies and haven\u2019t been\nupdated since. This project aims to\nshow how the existing system can be\nimproved with minimal investment,\nthough it also hopes to test several\nother engineering ideas, for example\nan origami-based deployable solar\npanel, never before tested in small\nsatellites.\n\u201cThis project is a first-of-its kind in\nImperial,\u201d said Javier Maurino, the\nproject manager. \u201cDeveloping a nano-satellite is a unique way to promote\nspace exploration and science, but it is\nalso very challenging. However, when\nyou have scientists and engineers\nfrom very different backgrounds\nworking together towards the\nsame goal, the results are simply\nincredible.\u201d\nThis project has brought together\nalmost a hundred Imperial students\nfrom many departments, all with\nthe hope of putting this satellite into\nspace. Money has been secured from\nthe university to design and create\na prototype, but the total budget\nfor the project is \u00a343,000. Once the\nprototype and design have been\ncompleted and tested, this summer\nthe project will be pitched to space\nagencies to gather the remaining\nfunds it needs for completion and\nlaunch.\nEven at this early stage of the\nproject, it has already taught the\nstudents involved much about the\nprocesses involved in the real-world\nspace industry.\n\u2018This project is fascinating because\nit enhances the understanding of a\nreal industrial process, and being\nled completely by students also\nteaches the importance of internal\norganisation and teamwork,\u2019 said\nAndrea Vivaldi, head of logistics and\nfinance.\nDavid Cava, systems team leader,\nsaid: \u2018Having something flying\naround the Earth developed by a\ngroup of students sounds to me\nmore as science fiction than real life.\nDetermination and lack of fear are\nrequired for this project and that is\nwhat I like the most about it.\u2019\nSo far however, the satellite is\nEMMA WILLS\nNEWS REPORTER\nunnamed.

    "content": "8 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.03.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s time for football fans to reap the benefits\nAfortnight ago, the Premier\nLeague unveiled their latest\ndeal for broadcast rights in\nthe United Kingdom. In an increase\nof a massive (and unexpected) 70%,\nthe deal for 2016-2019 is valued at\n\u00a35.1 billion. This keeps the Premier\nLeague comfortably at the top of the\nrevenue charts of football leagues\naround the world. In fact, its two\nnearest rivals for that title \u2013 the\nBundesliga in Germany and La Liga\nin Spain \u2013 will only receive \u00a31.8\nbillion and \u00a31.7 billion respectively.\nSky, who have again bought the\nmajority of the rights, have agreed to\npay more than \u00a311 million per game,\nwhile secondary broadcaster BT will\nfork out \u00a37.76 million, and this deal\nsells only the rights in the United\nKingdom.\nThe Premier League prides itself\non being one of the world\u2019s most\nmarketable sports leagues. In fact,\nit\u2019s third in the list of most valuable\nleagues in the world, behind the\nNational Football League and\nMajor League Baseball in America.\nHowever, once the international\nrights are sold, the figure for the\nPremier League is expected to rise to\na humongous \u00a38.8 billion.\nWhen I first heard about the size\nof the new television rights deal I\nhad two thoughts. The first was that\nwe should be ecstatic that we have a\nfootball league that is truly global.\nIt\u2019s a league that the whole world is\nwatching. Most footballers speak of\ntheir dream to come and ply their\ntrade in English football \u2013 and one\nwould suspect that that\u2019s not just\nabout the money.\nThe other thought is the ticket\nprices.\nThe BBC run a survey every year \u2013\nThe Price of Football \u2013 in which they\nask every club in the professional\nleagues of English football questions\nabout their ticket prices, and the\nprices at their concession stands. It\nfound that the average price of the\ncheapest adult ticket at a Premier\nLeague game was \u00a328.80. The most\nexpensive ticket was at Arsenal at a\nprice of \u00a397.\nIf we were to compare this to prices\nin Germany, there is a shocking\ndifference. The BBC surveyed the\ntop four German clubs from the last\nseason, and the results put English\nfootball to shame. The average\ncheapest ticket price of those four\nclubs is as low as \u00a312.12, with the\nmost expensive ticket priced at\n\u00a354.82 at Bayern Munich. The prices\nin France are even cheaper \u2013 the\naverage cheapest ticket from the top\nfour clubs is just \u00a39.79.\nHow does this relate to the latest TV\nrights deal? It was announced as part\nof the BBC survey that ticket prices\nin the Premier League had increased\nby 13% on average since 2011. That\u2019s\nalmost double the rate that the living\nwage has increased (6.8% over the\nsame time period). As a Manchester\nUnited season ticket holder, I have\nbeen pleased that my ticket to the\nTheatre of Dreams has been at the\nsame price for the last three years,\nand has not increased in price like at\nother clubs. But I feel it is now time\nfor clubs to make a gesture. A gesture\nto fans that have been there for their\nteam through thick and thin. A\ngesture to fans that want to be there\nfor their team, but simply can\u2019t afford\nit. A gesture for those who care.\nLast season\u2019s bottom club, Cardiff\nCity, was awarded more than \u00a362\nmillion from TV rights and prize\nmoney. That\u2019s more than the previous\nseason\u2019s champions, Manchester\nUnited, were awarded for their title-winning efforts. Given the numbers\ninvolved with TV rights and prize\nmoney, it is inconceivable to think\nthat ticket prices have to be increased\nfor clubs to survive.\nThe Premier League rights deal\nis split into three parts. 50% is\ndivided equally between clubs,\n25% is awarded based on a club\u2019s\nfinal position in the table, and the\nKunal Wagle thinks that a gesture is due to those of us who care\nremaining 25% is distributed as a\n\u2018facilities fee\u2019 \u2013 effectively a fee per\nmatch televised per club. Under the\ndeal, the team finishing last each\nseason will earn at least \u00a399 million,\nwhilst the champions will get \u00a3156\nmillion as a minimum.\nThose numbers make remarkable\nreading when put in the same context\nas ticket prices. It is estimated that\nthe windfall from the new television\nrights deal could pay for a reduction\nin each and every Premier League\nticket by \u00a340 without decreasing\ntheir revenues, when compared to\nthis season. Speaking about this exact\nscenario, Conservative MEP Dan\nDalton summed up my thoughts\nperfectly. He said: \u201cThis may be\nimplausible, but substantial cuts\nfor tickets should be a priority. Put\nsimply, clubs can afford to help their\nfans and communities at this time.\u201d\nIt\u2019s obvious that Premier League\nclubs can\u2019t decrease their ticket prices\nby such an amount \u2013 they have to\nuse some of the money to create an\nadvantage for themselves against\nEurope\u2019s top clubs (otherwise what\u2019s\nthe point?). By this day two years\nfrom now, all twenty Premier League\nclubs will be amongst the world\u2019s\ntop 30 richest clubs. They will all\nbe members of an elite set of clubs\nat football\u2019s richest table. But all\nthe other clubs in those top 30 have\nKUNAL WAGLE\nSPORTS EDITOR\nsignificantly cheaper tickets and\naren\u2019t suffering one bit.\nThe Premier League will point to\nattendances (and quite rightly too)\nto show that the system is working.\nPremier League attendances are at an\nall-time high. Despite this, the seeds\nof discontent are beginning to show\nthrough. Manchester United have\nlost numerous season ticket holders\nto nearby rebel club, FC United of\nManchester, while fans from Arsenal\nhave staged protests against the\nextortionate prices to see football\nat the Emirates. Crystal Palace fans\nunveiled a large banner at Selhurst\nPark two weeks ago, captioned \u201c\u00a35\nbillion in the trough yet supporters\nstill exploited. Share the wealth,\npigs.\u201d And in June 2013, fans from\nTottenham, Liverpool, Arsenal and\nManchester United descended on\nthe Premier League headquarters\nin London, shouting, \u201cYou greedy\nbastards, enough is enough.\u201d Clubs\nin the Premier League need to decide\nwhether they\u2019d be comfortable\nlooking into the eyes of their fans as\nthey try to justify increasing prices\nagain in the face of this new deal.\nWe are at an exciting crossroads\nin the Premier League.

I got invited to\nabout 100 events for stupid elections of students who\nare just doing it because they don\u2019t want a normal\njob, or their CV is shit. The less idiots clogging up my\nnews feed the better I say\n-ThirdYearApathy\nI know rite they shud get an internship or smth\ninstead lyk normal students have to\n- GoldmanSacsMan\nI\u2019m not even gonna vote, fucking CGCU never does\nanything decent like RCSU balls\n-A_Screw_Loose\nThat\u2019s coz there are no girls in CGCU so why would\nyou even bother going lol\n-Touch_my_balls_PLEASE\nI personally think it is appalling. Sabbaticals are paid\nan extortionate amount to represent the student body,\nand it is decisions like Acton and Teddington that are\nmade without student consultation, because in reality\nthe sabbs elected are too spineless to do anything\nabout it. Makes me sick\n- Extra_OrdinaryCouncilMember\nBut this is the first time we could have a female\nPresident in years thank fuck the patriarchy has been\npulled down a peg or two\n-Feminist_and_shouting_about_it\nActually, I think you will find that a record number\nof students have stood in these elections, more\nthan any other year. If you are trying to say student\nengagement is low, then I have the figures that say\notherwise. You are wrong.\n- Diego_UnionOverlord\nHave elections even started?\n-Wolfson_Suite_For_Lyf\nLol I guess it means I don\u2019t have to actually\ncampaign. BELLO\n-Do_you_fancy_a_bit_of_D(PW)\nGreat stuff guys! - Felix Editor\nExclusive: We interview this year\u2019s\nDP ENIS candidate\nOne of the more unlikely\ncandidates in the election this\nyear,Don Ma,is running for\nthe newly created position of Deputy\nPresident (Engagement of Naturally\nIntroverted Students),or DP ENIS.\nThe position was introduced last\nyear as a way to address the 43% of\nthe student body that fail to interact\nwith the Union but instead live in the\nlibrary.\nThe role of the DP ENIS is partially\nto research and address why these\nfew nomadic dwellers never interact\nwith students outside of the library,\nbut also to actually go and visit these\nstudents now and again,to make\nsure they are washing and eating\ncorrectly.\nDon Ma has pledged to donate a\nthird of his salary to pay for washlets,\nred bull and desk fans for these\nneglected students,and his long-term goal is to finally install air\nconditioning across all study areas.\nWe spoke to Don Ma,to hear what\nhe thinks he can bring to the role.\nHangman: Hi Don,nice to meet\nyou! What made you excited over\nDP ENIS?\nDM: Well,as a previous library\ndweller myself,I know what it can\nbe like to basically live within the\nconfines of the fifth floor of the\nlibrary.I know how distant everyone\nelse can seem when you trudge up\nthere at 9am,sit there for 14 hours\nstraight,and only leave your desk\nto go and get some coffee from the\nlibrary caf\u00e9.\nNow that hot drinks are allowed\nin the library,you don\u2019t even have\nan excuse to sit outside on the\nlawn for ten minutes or so; the only\nreason we don\u2019t have showers in the\nlibrary right now is because College\nare scared students may move in\npermanently.\nH: But isn\u2019t one of your manifesto\npromises to actually put bunk beds\ninto the library,especially now they\nare closing Weeks hall?\nDM: That is very true.I think we\nneed to accept that Weeks is going\nto close,but look for the best\nalternatives,and for those students\nwho already spend most of their\ntime in the library,they might as well\nbe encouraged to move in full time.\nThen those who live further out but\nprefer studying in departments or\nat home can move into the rooms\nthat those that now live in the library\nused to occupy.It\u2019s win-win.\nH: If people are going to live in the\nlibrary,won\u2019t that make it harder to\nencourage the students to interact\nwith the Union?\nDM: I think we need to accept the\ninevitable,and think about moving\nUnion outlets to the library instead.\nI remember a few years ago,\nthere was a competition to name\nMetric,and most people wanted to\nactually call it the Library,so there\nis a demand there for a night club\nthat embodies the elements of the\nlibrary that students have become\naccustomed to.\nSome people say they tried to\nname the nightclub after the Library\nas a joke,but I feel that in reality\nthere is a deeper rooted attraction\nto the building that we now need to\nembrace,not fight.\nAlthough saying that,one of my\npoints is to literally pay people to\ngo to Metric; people often do stuff if\nthey get money in return I\u2019ve heard,\nso it might be worth exploring that.\nH: Do you think College need to\nlisten more attentively to students\nabout the library?\nDM: I really do,and I feel that they\nare too busy dilly dallying around\nrent prices and hall demolitions to\nrealise that the main centre of all\nstudent life is in fact the library,and\nit should be treated as such.Why do\nwe only have one library caf\u00e9? Why\ndo we have 18 printers,24 scanners,\nthree lifts but no toilets?\nThese are the issues that these\nneglected students face day in and\nday out,yet all the other sabbs just\nworry about storage space for clubs,\nthe price of pints and consultation\nplatforms or frameworks or\nwhatever.That is why this role is key;\nit actually seems to care about the\nissues that matter to students.\nH: Naturally introverted students\nare hard to engage with; they\ncan be quite shy.Do you have any\nexperience you can draw on to\nensure that this large demographic\ngets the attention it deserves?\nDM: I\u2019ve learnt a lot about\nintroverted students during my\ninternship as a park ranger; they are\nvery similar to hedgehogs\u2013they\nlike to hide away or curl up in a ball.\nThey are quite prickly too,and must\nbe handled carefully.I will approach\nthese students the same way I\nhandled the hedgehogs; wearing\ngloves,offering up saucers of milk\nand talking in hushed tones.I think\nthat way they will then be brave\nenough to let me pet them\u2013I mean,\ntalk to them\u2013and I can ensure they\nare all happy and healthy.\nThanks Don Ma,and good luck in\nyour campaign!\n\n"

Additionally,\npure narrative games are sometimes\nGMless (or GMful) \u2013 where the role\nof GM is either not needed, is shared\nby all players, or done by the game\nitself using some sort of simple\nalgorithm. If you enjoy realising that\nyour character is not about to die,\nbut rather that events have conspired\nto create a situation so horrific that\ndeath would be greatly preferred (or\n\"If you like\nmaking\nstories),\nnarrativism\nis for you.\"\n\"Welcome\nto the\nwonderful\nworld of\ntabletop\nRPGs!\"\nin general if you like making stories),\nnarrativism is for you.\nHere are some examples of each of\nthe combinations of style, with a bit of\ninfo on each one. Each RPG I mention\nhere is either widely available, or I\nhave access to it personally (if the\nlatter, feel free to contact me to\nborrow my copy).\nPure Gamist: This is a difficult one\nto place, because most RPGs that\nare pure gamist are closer to board\ngames than RPGs. But the one that\nI know of which fits this criteria is\nWarhammer Quest \u2013 it is essentially\nstandard Dungeons and Dragons in\nthe Warhammer universe, but with\nthe focus on going into dungeons\nand beating up monsters. It is also,\napparently, incredibly difficult to\nprogress. Sadly, Warhammer Quest is\nnow out of print, but the Dungeons and\nDragons (see below) board games often\ngive a similar feel, if you want to try\nthese out.\nPure Simulationist: The best\nexample of this is probably the\nBattletech/Mechwarrior series of\nRPGs, in which players take on\nthe role of mech pilots in the 31st\ncentury. Another (arguable) example\nis GURPS, the General Unified\nRole Playing System, which makes\ndifferent abilities more or less\ndifficult to gain and thus involves\na lot of looking things up. The best\nthing about GURPS is that the books\ngive such detailed setting-creation\ninformation that it can be adapted to\nany system.\nPure Narrative: This is my thing, so\nI\u2019ve got a few examples for you. Itras\nBy is my personal favourite, which is a\n1920s surrealist game, but the system\nis so neat and concise that it can be\nadapted to any setting with very little\ndifficulty. Mystic Empyrean is your\nstandard sword and sorcery setting,\nbut the system prevents character\noptimisation by giving other players\ncontrol over how your character\nimproves. The idea is for it to be based\non how you play. Finally, Fiasco is\na GMless game designed for single\nsessions in which every character sets\nup an elaborate plan to get their way,\nand it all ends up in (you guessed it!)\na fiasco.\nGamist-Simulationist: The most\ncommon is Dungeons and Dragons,\nwidely considered the first ever RPG.\nIt\u2019s a standard swords and sorcery type\ngame. It is worth noting that the latest\niteration of this game is an attempt\nto switch it to a Narrative-Gamist\nRPG, which is an interesting change.\nHowever, another popular game in\nthis category is the Warhammer 40k\nseries of RPGs (starting with Rogue\nTrader), which take advantage of the\nrich backstory of the Warhammer\nuniverse to create a sci-fi compelling\nuniverse for the players to explore.\nSimulationist-Narrative: This is\na difficult combination to pull off.\nEoris is an example of this kind of\ngame, but it isn\u2019t well executed. Whilst\nit provides a rich and compelling\nuniverse in which magic is consistent\nwith modern science, the rules are\nmessy and incomplete. There are\na lot of criticisms of the game and\nmost are valid \u2013 but it is nevertheless\na salvageable system. However, this\ncombination hasn\u2019t yet been done well\nas far as I am aware, and so I would\npersonally recommend that if you\nlike both simulationist and narrative\nstyles, pick one or the other (or play\nsingle session games and switch\nbetween the two).\nNarrative-Gamist: A big example\nis the FATE system, which combines\naction-RPG combat with a heavy focus\non character development and plot.\nIt\u2019s a very fluid system, but puts a lot\nof stress on the GM relative to other\ngames. There is no fixed setting.\nNow that you have an idea of what\nkind of game you want to play, you\nneed to find people to play it with!\nThere are three major RPG groups\nin Central London \u2013 Darksphere,\nthe London Indie RPG meetup, and\n(of course), the Imperial Tabletop\nGaming society. Darksphere is a store\nthat takes about 20 minutes to get\nto by tube. The focus in the store is\nMagic: The Gathering, but they run\nDungeons and Dragons games every\nwednesday evening. The Indie RPG\ngroup meet up a few times a month\nnear London Bridge, and focus on\nsingle session, narrative games.\nThey\u2019re a great place to go if you enjoy\nnarrative games!\nFinally, if you\u2019re interested in\nplaying RPGs at Imperial, we run\nsingle sessions on alternating Fridays\nand Sundays.

With \u2018modern\u2019\nart confined to a temporality at the\nbeginning of the 20th\ncentury, and\nthe use of both \u2018postmodern\u2019 and\n\u2018contemporary\u2019 rapidly falling out\nof favour, a new word is being called\nfor. The author drew attention to the\nincreased use of the term \u2018now\u2019, which\nhas seemingly been employed to\nresolve this problem. At first glance,\nthe organisers of View Art Festival\nat the Institut Fran\u00e7ais, were not\nfaced with confronting this dilemma.\nAfter all, their ambitious programme,\nwhich took place over the weekend\nlinking February and March, was\nconcerned with discussions around\nthe topic of art history.\nThe variety of events on offer\nensured that there would be\nsomething to suit anyone with a\nmild interest in the arts, even if that\nsomething was merely fulfilling\na desire to rub shoulders with the\ncontinental art crowd. There were\nfree short talks running throughout\nthe day on Saturday, complemented\nby debates of a longer form to lead\non from the challenge posed by the\nFriday night opening discussion\non \u2018Redefining the Artistic Canon\u2019.\nThe billing featured contributions\nfrom many respected curators, art\nhistorians and other representatives\nof the French and British art\nestablishment. My favourite elements\nof the programme related to the\nPreserving and Restoring focus,\nwith questions such as \u2018How do\npreservation and restoration of art\nworks determine the course of art\nhistory?\u2019 under discussion by the best\nminds in the field.\nThe concurrently running series of\nstudent-led \u2018salons\u2019 with intriguing\ntitles along the lines of \u2018The Tales of\nthe Killer Rabbit\u2019, on the other hand,\nensured that a fresh perspective on\nart theory from the next generation\nof critics was also voiced. For a\nWooden aircraft windtunnel model in the Science Museum\u2019s Blythe House. Photo: Creative Commons\ninsight into the Tate\u2019s upcoming\nSonia Delaunay retrospective,\ndelivered by the curators of the\nParisian rendering of the exhibition.\nThe Institut Fran\u00e7ais provided a\nparticularly appropriate setting for\nthis discussion about Delaunay and\nher ideology \u2013 one of her colourful\nabstract tapestries normally hangs\nabove the main staircase of the\nentrance hall.\nConstrained by a short-talk format,\nthe speakers provided a regrettably\nbrief overview of the work and life\nof this doyenne of modern art. A\nkey figure of the European avant-garde, she defied easy categorisation.\nDespite engaging with the numerous\nemergent movements of the first\nhalf of the twentieth century,\nincluding particular intimacy with\nthe Parisian members of Dada, Sonia\nand her husband Robert remained\nat a distance and cultivated their\nown version of what it meant to\nbe an artist in the modern world.\nDelaunay\u2019s understanding of this\ntranscended the boundaries of\naesthetic art and allowed her to\nengage with fashion, interior design,\ntraditional craft, theatre and film as\nmedia for delivering her message.\nShe often modelled her own designs\nat social events, almost suggesting\nan early version of performance art.\nFor Sonia Delaunay a line between\nart and life was unnecessary; all of\nher activities and collaborations bled\ninto and complemented each other,\ncontinually drawing attention to\nher other work. The curators argued\nthat this warm embrace of self-advertising coupled to an interest\nin the industrialisation of design\nprocesses reflected a utopic vision\nwhich had capitalism at its core. In\nthis way, she represented a stark\ncontrast to the similar developments\namongst her Russian contemporaries,\nthe Constructivists and Suprematists,\nwho were motivated by socialist\nideology. The talk was supported by\nimages of the exhibition, which along\nwith the persuasive rhetoric of the\nspeakers helped to generate a genuine\nexcitement for the opening of this\nshow in April. Apart from paintings,\nthe exhibition is set to feature\ntapestries, photographs, costumes,\nfurniture and books \u2013 a feast for the\nsenses drawn from the richness of the\noeuvre of this remarkable artist.\nIn contrast to the talks, the guided\ntour listings seemed to be the more\npopular events of the Festival, with\nall of the options selling out well in\nadvance of the opening night. I was\nlucky enough to reserve a place on a\n\u2018Behind the Scenes\u2019 visit to Blythe\npublic less partial to the topics of\nconservation and collections, the\n\u2018Avant-Gardes and Precursors\u2019\nstrand also had plenty to offer.\nThe star draws were probably the\nSaturday night appearance of the\ninimitable Jeremy Deller, winner of\nthe 2004 Turner Prize and Britain\u2019s\nrepresentative at the 2013 Venice\nBiennale, and a screening of the\nDadaist film Entre\u2019acte on Sunday\nafternoon.\nAnyone who managed to attend the\n\u2018My Night with Philosophers\u2019 event\nhosted by the same organisation two\nyears ago would be able to understand\nmy nervous anticipation of the\nqueues I was likely to encounter,\nespecially in view of the quality of the\nprogramme. However, on entering\nthe main building of the French\ncultural centre early on Saturday\nafternoon I was surprised to find\nthe staff to visitor ratio peculiarly\nbalanced to oppose my expectations,\nand the atmosphere surprisingly\nsubdued.\nI was there to attend a fascinating\n\"Delaunay\ncultivated\nher own\nversion\nof what\nit meant\nto be an\nartist in\nthe modern\nworld.\"\n\"She\nrepresented\na stark\ncontrast\nto the\nRussians\nwho were\nmotivated\nby Socialist\nideology.\"\nCulture Celebrating the 1600th issue of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 7\nFELIX 06.03.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIs Imperial changing for the better?\nI\u2019ve been at Imperial for seven\nyears, which is quite a long\ntime \u2013 longer than most. In that\ntime, I\u2019ve seen a lot of change. Some\nof these changes are ones I never\nimagined happening, like the loss\nof Evelyn Gardens, which was my\nhome as a fresher, but they\u2019re mostly\noverwhelmingly positive.\nImperial can sometimes seem like a\nbit of a depressing place. For the vast\nmajority of your time here, you\u2019re\nstressed and overwrought, and, from\nwhat I\u2019ve seen, it can seem like a\nreally negative place to be a lot of the\ntime. When people ask me why I\u2019ve\nstayed here so long, and done three\ndifferent degrees, I often compare it\nto Stockholm syndrome, and that I\u2019ve\neventually come to love my captors.\nBut I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time at\nImperial. Some years have been better\nthan others, and I\u2019ve hit many pitfalls\nalong the way. I\u2019ve experienced some\ntruly unacceptable things, from\nblatant unapologetic sexism, to\nunfathomable lacks of empathy, but\nI\u2019ve also seen Imperial change and\ngrow and develop into something far\ngreater than it was before.\nWhen I did my undergraduate\ndegree in physics, the vast majority\nof the lecture courses didn\u2019t supply\nnotes, so if you didn\u2019t go to lectures,\nthat was it. We didn\u2019t have printed\nnotes (available online), which is\nusually the case now, and we certainly\ndidn\u2019t have the lectures recorded\nfor later viewing. Our tutorials\nwere practically non-existent, and\ndefinitely didn\u2019t constitute the\nincreased compulsory contact hours\nthat students have now. It gives me a\nwarm happy feeling to see things like\nPanopto go from crazy ideas to being\nfully implemented and used. Tuition\nfees may be higher now, but people\nare definitely fighting to get more for\ntheir money, and it is working.\nUniversities have such rapid\nturnover, and it\u2019s sometimes hard to\nfeel like anything makes a difference\nwhen you come and go so quickly,\nnever seeing anything go from the\nconcept stage to fruition. The people\ncurrently protesting the future\nclosure of Weeks Hall will probably\nhave left by the time it comes to pass,\nin the same way that most people who\nran the #AgainstActon campaign\nwon\u2019t be here to see Woodward open\nin October. But students do make a\ndifference, and if you\u2019ve stuck around\nas long as I have, you can start to\nsee that all these little things do add\nup to a positive, albeit slow, change.\nImperial isn\u2019t perfect, not by a long\nstretch, but it\u2019s full of well-meaning\nstudents who want to make it better,\nand that counts for a lot.\nI used to really dislike Imperial, and\nbeing a part of Felix has definitely\nbeen a huge part of my unalienation.\nIn a way, it\u2019s opened my eyes to some\nof the darker sides of College and the\nUnion, and the injustices that take\nplace, but it\u2019s exposed me to so many\npeople who I would otherwise never\nhave met, with nothing in common\nbut a desire to voluntarily give up\ntime to produce something purely for\nthe entertainment of other Imperial\nstudents.\nI wish I\u2019d been brave enough to get\ninvolved with Felix years before I\ndid, because now I realise that there\nwas nothing to be afraid of. I used\nto think that it was an untouchable\nThis place always has, and always will be my first love.. Photo: Imperial College\nTessa Davey looks back on seven years of Imperial and Felix\npublication, and that I would have\nnothing of value to contribute to it.\nBut now I realise that it\u2019s not. It\u2019s\njust a bunch of students, sitting in an\noffice, using their free time to write\narticles, because they enjoy it.\nAs times change, Felix does too.\nWhen I arrived at Imperial, copies of\nFelix were distributed to the rooms\nof every fresher in halls, and right\nfrom the moment you arrived, you\nstarted reading it. It was an Imperial\ninstitution; in Friday afternoon\nlectures, everyone had a copy open,\nwhich is sadly no longer the case as\nprint newspapers fall out of fashion.\nIf I look at the archived issues\nfrom my undergraduate years, I\nremember so many of the articles in\nthe Comment section starting heated\ndiscussions (often had out in whispers\nduring lectures), and none more than\nthose of Angry Geek (or A. Geek, as he\nwas originally known). I\u2019m constantly\nsurprised every time someone hasn\u2019t\nheard of him these days, but of\ncourse, he hasn\u2019t graced our pages\nwith his impassioned words since\n2012, which means that his legacy is\nbeginning to be forgotten.\nBut Angry Geek meant a lot to\nme. He wrote from 2007-2012,\nwhich covered my entire time as\nan undergraduate. He is probably\nthe reason that I\u2019ve always read the\nComment section so avidly, and why\nI jumped at the chance to edit and\nwrite this section. For the 1600th\nissue, we tried to contact him, on the\noff-chance he was still checking his\nold email account, to see if he wanted\nto write something. What came back\nwas beyond my highest expectations,\nand I\u2019m honoured to be able to print\nit.\nAngry Geek rejuvenated the\nComment section, directly inspiring\narticles that brought it back from\nnon-existent to overflowing. Reading\nback through his old articles in the\narchives, I\u2019m reminded that he wasn\u2019t\njust an angry bastard, but someone\nwho truly cared about expressing\nopinions, and that is a heritage that I\nwant to uphold. I\u2019m so touched that\nhe still reads Felix, and that he\u2019s proud\nof the section as it is today. I\u2019m glad\nhe\u2019s still angry, and using his anger\nfor good things. I hope there are still\npeople who remember him around\nto read; his article has brought me\nto tears every time I\u2019ve read it, and\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one for\nwhom this article will be poignant.\nAngry Geek, I still don\u2019t know who\nyou are, but if you want to get a drink\nand bemoan the rising cost of drinks\nat the Union Bar, I\u2019d love to meet you.\nTESSA DAVEY\nCOMMENT EDITOR\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d\nbeen brave\nenough\nto get\ninvolved\nwith F.elix\nyears\nbefore I\ndid\u201d\n\"When\npeople ask\nme why\nI\u2019ve stayed\nhere so\nlong...,\nI often\ncompare\nit to\nStockholm\nsyndrome.\"\n\n"
