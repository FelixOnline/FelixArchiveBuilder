However, my\nlast experience of musical theatre at\n\u2018Parade\u2019 had near converted me to one\nwho loves spontaneous song and dance\non stage, and so I went in optimistic.\nSuch is the show\u2019s notoriety that anyone having difficulty locating the theatre on exiting Leicester Square tube,\nwill have their way guided by huge yellow signs to the Noel Coward- equally\nyellow and eye catching.\nAt first, I really did wonder at how\nmuch I would enjoy the show when\nthe first actor runs onto the stage with\na large Muppet on his hand and starts\nsinging and moving the puppet accord-ingly- not even bothering with any sort\nof ventriloquism. I knew full well \u2018Avenue Q\u2019 was the Muppet musical, but\nhad never until then given any thought\nas to how they would actualise it. I had\nmy answer. Being sure that this previously unseen style of conceptualisation\nwould grow on me, I didn\u2019t let it taint\nthe rest of the show.\nThe musical follows Princeton, fresh\nout of college, ready for anything the\nworld has to throw at him, as he moves\nto Avenue Q- one of New York\u2019s less\nprestigious areas. There he encounters\na group of quirky, yet lovable friends\nand inevitably falls for Kate Monsterthe single teacher. Princeton\u2019s apparent purpose and priority is to find his\npurpose\u2026 in life. The musical takes\nus through love, puppet sex, absinthe\ncocktails, born again virgins and closet\ngays. A gem of the production is the\n\u201cBad idea bears\u201d, two irresistibly cute-seemingly-innocent bears who come\nalong at the worst time to coax you\ninto making the most irresponsible\ndecision- hence absinthe cocktails and\nrampant Muppet sex.\nThe lewdly and crudely anticipated\nhumour I was expecting kicked off immediately to my delight and the songs\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s a little bit racist\u201d and \u201cThe\nInternet is for Porn\u201d have you laughing\nin no time. Light-hearted and slapstick,\nI found my interest waning at times as\nthe humour overall is a little patchy\nand a bit too obvious (clearly I am used\nto dry, sarcastic British wit), with a lot\nof the jokes relevant to American culture and so possibly wasted on a lot of\nthe audience. Do you know who Gary\nColeman is?!\nMusically, the songs are exactly as I\nexpected from all commercial musi-cals- no reflection on the musicians\nthemselves- so I was left neither disappointed or impressed. Where I was impressed was the stunning voice of Julie\nAtherton who took on the role of Kate\nMonster. Indeed, all the cast were well-endowed vocally.\nFor some reason unknown to me,\nI was expecting a larger cast but the\nsix actors managed to carry out many\nmore characters seamlessly and with\ngreat enthusiasm and energy. The task\nof bringing an inanimate puppet to\nlife could be a recipe for disaster if the\npeople executing it are not proficient\nenough however no such disaster ensued and the choreography that went\ninto co-ordinating the movement of\nTrekkie monster, for example, was out-standing, especially when undertaken\nby two people manipulating one arm\neach.\nA lot of effort went into set design\nand creating a good atmosphere, with\nsome spectacular and highly novel ide-as- I particularly liked the fountain of\nbubbles erupting from the building top\nduring Rod\u2019s dream.\nIf you love musicals and pantomimes,\nthen you are guaranteed a great time.\nBut if musicals rank rather lower in\nyour books, you won\u2019t be missing out\non an experience of a lifetime if you\ndon\u2019t rush off and see it now. Maybe\nI have transformed into a theatrical\nsnob since being promoted to the high\nprofile position of one-of-four arts edi-tors, but nowadays I look for more in a\ndramatic escapade than a slightly vacuous storyline and less than impressionable musical score. Hmmm, I feel I\nhave been too harsh- there is a lot right\nabout \u2018Avenue Q\u2019, and if \u201cdeep theatre\u201d does not captivate you then do go\nalong, shits and giggles are promised! \u201cLook over there, Jimothy! Is it... yes! It\u2019s my career in serious film and theatre, cannoning into the sunset!\u201d\n\n"

It\u2019s been invaded\nby the world\u2019s only superpower, occupied by foreign troops and now while it\nstruggles to ward off all out civil war;\nit could be invaded again. Not by G.I.\nJoes but instead invaders from the\nnorth, the Turkish.\nBut why, I hear you ask. Why on earth\nwould Turkey want to invade Iraq?\nWell here\u2019s the story. There are Kurdish people living in the north of Iraq\nbut also in the south of Turkey. Some\nof the Kurdish people wish to live in\na state consisting of Southern Turkey\nand Northern Iraq, which would be\ncalled Kurdistan or something like that.\nEssentially it\u2019s a case of separatism and\nthe terrorist group which heads the\nKurdish separatist movement is called\nthe PKK or the Kurdish Workers Party.\nSo let\u2019s wrap up the situation; today in\n2007 Turkey accuses the Kurdish people and the Iraqi government of allowing PKK fighters to use Northern Iraq\nas a base for attacks across the border\nin Turkey. Not only this, the Turkish Government has passed a motion\nthrough parliament allowing a military\ninvasion of northern Iraq to attack PKK\nbases and camps. After the attacks last\nweekend, the Turkish government released a statement saying \u201cAlthough\nit respects Iraq\u2019s territorial integrity,\nTurkey will not tolerate that terrorism\nbe aided and abetted and will not be\nafraid to pay whatever cost to protect\nits rights, its indivisible unity and its\ncitizens,\u201d. In other words, if the attacks\ndon\u2019t stop, we\u2019re coming in.\nOf course the President of the Kurdish region in the North of Iraq, Massoud Barzani, has denied that his\ngovernment provides assistance and\nshelter for the PKK and stated that any\nTurkish troops in northern Iraq will be\nfought off.\nPKK fighters have been making\ncross-border raids into Turkey; the\nmost recent attacks last weekend resulted in the deaths of 12 Turkish soldiers and 33 PKK fighters. It should\nbe noted that this is an ongoing con-flict, and that the PKK does in fact use\nnorthern Iraq as a base. There are an\nestimated 3,000 PKK fighters currently\nin northern Iraq, and they do continue\nto wage war against Turkey.\nHowever this alone does not justify\nthe immediate use of military force.\nWhat compels Turkey to use force\nis the lack of action from the US and\nthe Iraqi government. Confusingly the\nU.S., which supported Israel against\nHezbollah in a similar situation, has\nnot attempted to help its Turkish ally\neven though it has military forces in\nthe area (by the end of the year around\n200,000). Turkey has repeatedly asked\nU.S. troops to root out PKK fighters in\nthe north but the US has refused to do\nso because it does not wish to destabilize the relatively peaceful Kurdish\nnorth of Iraq. Double standards are\nsimply screaming out here and the\nthought \u2018you had no problem destabi-lizing Lebanon\u2019 jumps to the forefront\nof my mind.\nThe Iraqi government has similarly\ndone little to prevent attacks into Turkey. Reasons for this range from the\nlack of authority in the Kurdish north\nof Iraq to simply the fact that it lacks\nthe political and military stability to attempt any action against the PKK. To\nput it more frankly, the Iraqi government has more pressing concerns, like\nits own survival.\nThere is another player in this situation and that is the Kurdish semi-au-tonomous government itself. However\nagain they have not moved against the\nPKK. This is firstly because the Turkish government has not asked them\nto; it feels that any direct talks with\nthe Kurdish people signals approval\nof their independence. And secondly\nbecause the Kurdish government is\nmore interested in securing economic\ndevelopment and avoiding conflict in a\nrelatively peaceful area of Iraq, so dealing with an armed group that does not\nthreaten them is not high on their list\nof priorities.\nWhile I have shown that there certainly seems to be little choice for\nTurkey ther than to take matters into\nits own hands, this will certainly not\nbe beneficial to itself, much less the\nKurdish people. The largest nonhuman casualty of conflict would be\neconomic ties between Kurdish people\nand Turkey. The threat of military action has tended to overshadow the fact\nthat economic ties between Turks and\nKurds have been growing at a strong\npace of late. Trade between Turkey and\nIraq (much of it with Kurds in Northern Iraq) reached $3 billion in 2006\nand could top $5 billion at the end of\n2007. An invasion would certainly put\nan end to this lucrative relationship.\nFrom a political perspective, an invasion would be the equivalent of Turkey\nshooting itself in the foot. This whole\nseries of events shows the Iraqi government in Baghdad\u2019s inability to really do anything in the north of Iraq.\nAn invasion would further remove the\nKurdish people from Iraqi government\ncontrol and give the Kurdish people a\nbanner for independence i.e. the Iraqi\ngovernment can\u2019t protect us so we\nneed to protect ourselves. The aim of\nthe invasion is to crackdown on the\nPKK and simultaneously attack Kurdish separatism. However, the real result\nmay in fact be increased independence\nfor the Kurds and an ever more credible independent Kurdish state.\nWe\u2019re getting to the end of my article and maybe some of you are expecting a solution. Unfortunately, it\nisn\u2019t coming. I can tell you why \u2013 the\nfailure of the US, with over 160,000\ntroops to deal with one of the few terrorist organizations actually linked to\nIraq. I can also tell you the effects of\nconflict, which in truth don\u2019t require\na genius to figure out. Unfortunately\nfor the Kurdish people, Turkey is more\ninterested in its border security than\nthe economic stability of Kurdish Iraq.\nAdd to this the growing pressure from\nthe Turkish public to respond strongly\nand the passing of the motion allowing\ninvasion in the Turkish parliament and\nit begins to seem all but inevitable that\nwe will soon see another set of armed\nforces in Iraq.\nLi-Teck Lau\nPolitics Editor\nA map of the region showing Kurdish presence in red\nWarfare from afar; Turkish forces prepare to engage the rising threat of Kurdish independance\nB\necause the world is getting\nsmaller, news in Yemen is\nnews in the UK. But due\nto physical limitations, the\nwhole of last week can only\nbe fitted into a column by means of\nsnappy paragraphs.\nBB returns to elation and death\nthreats\nSince returning to Pakistan after 8\nyears of self imposed exile in the UK,\nBenazir Bhutto, the country\u2019s former\nprime minister, has been under intense\nprotection having received numerous death threats. A bomb last week\naimed at killing Ms Bhutto instead\ntook the lives of 139 civilians and body\nguards. Her return could mark a new\npower sharing relationship with General Musharraf, who took power in a\ncoup in 1999. Musharraf now wishes\nto be democratically elected and plans\nto resign his position of general. However, tensions remain as many of her\nsupporters are suspicious of the current government\u2019s intentions and even\npoint the finger of blame for the devastating explosions on the secret service.\nLatest release\nAl Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden\nreleased a new audio tape on Monday\nwhich was aired on TV network Al\nJazeera. The world\u2019s most wanted man\nurged Muslims in the Middle East to\njointhebattleagainstUSinvaders,even\ndeclaring Holy War on peace keepers\nin the troubled northern regions of the\nSudan. The US has confirmed the authenticity of the recording.\nDouble standards in Central\nAmerica\nEcuador\u2019s President Rafael Correa requested that the US allow an Ecuadorian base in Miami as a condition for\nrenewing a lease for an American air\nbase in the Central American state. \u201cIf\nthere\u2019s no problem having foreign soldiers on a country\u2019s soil, surely they\u2019ll\nlet us have an Ecuadorean base in the\nUnited States\u201d he said. The US embassy insists Washington\u2019s presence in\nEcuador is to combat the fervent narcotics trade.\nMore of the same in China\nHu Jin Tao will remain the head of the\nnine-member Political Bureau Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of\nChina, the country\u2019s central governing\nbody, after Sunday\u2019s ballot of congress.\nJiang Ze Min, who Mr Hu succeeded\nin 2002, and was often seen as a behind\nthe scenes power broker, was absent\nfrom official portraits and photographs in the media, marking the end\nof power held by original revolutionary leaders. Wen Jia Bao also kept his\nposition of Premier, but there are now\nfour new members of the China\u2019s most\npowerful cabinet. The Communist\nParty derives much of its legitimacy\nfrom economic success and the raising\nof living standards.\n\n"

On\n12th October, the report on the Union\u2019s finances for the year ended 31st\nJuly 2007 was released by the Union\nExec (Executive Committee, ie: the big\ndawgs who oversee the running of the\nUnion). The report gave out a bit of a\nmixed message where it indicated that\noverall Union surplus income (dollar\nleft in your wallet after paying your\nbills) was \u00a338,715; up from the previous year (\u00a313,372). However, expenditure was also up with Union trading\n(including the bars, the shop and ents)\nfinishing around \u00a385,000 down.\nIf you are still interested, or even\noutraged at such a loss then I will\ncontinue.\nThe Union trading loss (compared to\nthe previous year\u2019s surplus of \u00a3166,963)\ncould be partially explained by management restructuring and staff costs\nwhich were well up from the previous\nyear. There were also reduced sales\npossibly due to continued building\nwork on the Beit redevelopment. The\nbiggest loss makers last year were the\nbars (due to the aforementioned staff\ncosts) and ents; the latter along with\nthe Union Shop have made a loss in the\nlast year two years. Also some of the\nbigger earners for the Union, such as\nthe room lettings were down last year,\nwhich did not help plug the gap from\nthe trading losses. Another dispiriting kick in the coffers came from an\nincrease in clubs and societies spending (how dare they spend more money\non their so-called \u2018social gatherings\u2019)\nand an increase in irrecoverable VAT\n(since the Union can claim VAT back,\nthis reduces expenditure but if it is ir-recoverable, then say bye to your new\ngold-plated toilet-brush).\nOkay, I can hear you hollering at me,\nwanting me to explain how the Union\nactually made a profit after all this talk\nof loss. Well, Mr. Price-WaterhouseCooper-Smythe Esq. it is partly down\nto an increased subvention from the\nCollege \u2013 this is basically the pocket\nmoney the Union gets from College\nevery year to buy our silence and\nsomething to look pretty in. Along\nwith more money from the College,\nthe Union made a significant amount\nof money elsewhere, such as the Centenary Ball (the Summer Ball all tarted\nup) which made a \u00a312,302 surplus and\nwas an outright success compared\nto the previous year\u2019s loss of \u00a344,697.\nThere have been some mutterings\nthough that the Centenary Ball did not\nmake as much as was hoped (consider-ing you only have one centenary), but\nthis amount was also bolstered by a\nvast increase in van hiring income of\nover \u00a330,000 (after expenditure) following the previous year\u2019s loss. Other\nventures allowing the sabbs to bathe\nin crispy ten-pound notes included a\nsuccessful Careers Fair and returns on\ninvestment.\nIn conclusion, there can be back-slapping all around after a successful\nyear during a period of management\nrestructuring and other difficulties. To\nhighlight this, since the new management has been in effect there has been a\nvery successful Freshers\u2019 Week including the Union being packed out with\nover 800 people for the Rugby World\nCup Final. If one can measure happiness through material wealth then the\nUnion has some cause for a smile but\nif it is found through every utterance\nof \u201cHELLAAAAMASSSSHUP\u201d then\nthere is cause for celebration.\nLeft, Mr Union\u2019s wallet. Right, Mr Trading\u2019s wallet\nToo many qualifications\nspoil the academic broth\nOn Tuesday the government announced a further three Diplomas,\ntaking the planned total to seventeen.\nDiplomas are the government\u2019s latest attempt to shake up the education\nsystem for students aged 14 \u2013 19 years\nold. From September 2008, pupils in\nthe UK in years 10, 12 and above will\nbe given the choice whether to take\nGCSEs, A-Levels, Diplomas or a mixture of two.\nThe drastic reformation is happening due to continuing improvements in\nA-Level and GCSE results, with many\ncritics believing the qualifications are\nbecoming stale and too easy. Similarly,\ncomplaints from universities that distinguishing between school leavers\u2019\ntalents is too difficult has helped put\none of the final nails in the A-Level\u2019s\ncoffin.\nFive of the Diplomas will be available\nfor students to begin studying next\nyear, namely Engineering, Creative\n& Media, Information Technology,\nSociety Health & Development and\nConstruction & The Built Environment. The courses are designed to mix\nclassroom learning with experience in\nthe workplace in a move which will see\nstudents being nurtured for the \u201creal\nworld\u201d even earlier than before.\nEd Balls, the Schools Secretary, who\nannounced on Tuesday that the three\nnew Diplomas would be in sciences,\nhumanities and languages, said that\nDiplomas should become the \u201cqualifications of choice\u201d. The government has\nstated that the Diplomas will be run\nalongside existing qualifications until\n2013, by which time it plans to have\ncomprehensively reviewed the A-Level\nsystem. Potentially, A-Levels could be\nscrapped within six years.\nHowever, with the current multitude\nof GCSEs and A-Levels on offer to\nstudents, many people feel that making further qualifications available to\nstudents is just going to cause confu-sion. Further condemnation comes\nfrom various teachers\u2019 Unions, with\nthe headteachers\u2019 union ASCL saying\nteachers are already \u201cpunch drunk\u201d\nwith other reforms. The ATL teachers\u2019\nunion blasted the government claiming that they are taking half-hearted\nmeasures in response to improving\nA-Level standards, saying that they\u2019ve\n\u201cbottled it again\u201d.\nThe news comes at a time of great\nchange for the UK\u2019s education system.\nThere is a distinct danger that the Diplomas could just be brushed aside in\nthe future, as lesser qualifications than\nA-Levels or GCSEs. Mr Balls seems to\nbe aware of this, as well as the need for\nindustry and university backing stating\nthat, \u201cwe need the business and academic worlds to back these qualifications and help make them a success.\u201d\n\u201cWith their success\u201d he believes, \u201cDiplomas could emerge as the jewel of\nour education system.\u201d\nRelying on the business and university worlds to make the UK\u2019s education\nsystem work will come as a frightening prospect to some. At a time when\nall academic qualifications, from Key\nStage 2 to postgraduate level, are being devalued following criticism of the\nwidespread \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d subjects,\nthere is much anxiety amongst students of all ages as they are confused\nby the increasing choice and spiralling\ncost of our education.\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\n\u201cConstruction & The Built\nEnvironment, here I come!\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Email Nigel on advice@imperial.ac.uk\nEmail Kirsty on dpew@imperial.ac.uk\nWelfare\nWelfare Editors \u2013 Nigel Cooke and Kirsty Patterson\n11\nFriday 26 October 2007 felix\nThe importance of being vaccinated\nAnother article on mumps to inform those of you still afraid of needles and directions to our new location\nTips on how to stay safe on and around the university campus\nThere are several reasons why I have\nto be extremely careful about writing\nabout mumps. For starters, if I nag you\nmore about the need for your vaccina-tions, I\u2019ll get lynched \u2013 by the Editor,\nfor a start. But you really DO need to\nget vaccinated\u2026\nSecondly, I don\u2019t want to incite mass\npanic about symptoms which almost\neveryone will get this term to some\ndegree, but which are not mumps. The\nproblem is that mumps in the early\nstages mimics \u201cFresher\u2019s Flu\u201d, which\nin the vast majority of cases does not\nneed to be seen by a doctor. I would\nsuggest that the NHS direct helpline\non 0845 4647 or their self-help guidance at www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk is a\ngood place to start. The Health Centre\nsupport health (and other!) education\nand are of course happy to see anyone\nwho feels they need to be seen.\nSo the symptoms of mumps, like\nFresher\u2019s Flu, begin with a headache\nand fever for a day or two before the\ndisease is characterised by swelling\nof the parotid gland. The parotid is a\nsalivary gland which lies in the neck\nand cheek just in front of the ear, so\npatients with mumps look a bit like\nhamsters with stuffed pouches. It can\naffect one side or both. If you have flu-like symptoms with cheek swelling like\nthis there is no need to panic, but it is\nbest to book an appointment to see us,\nor come to our emergency clinic 08.30-10.00 Mon-Fri. The time between exposure and symptoms is 2-3 weeks.\nMore often than not, there are no\nother features. As mumps is a self-limiting viral illness treatment is for\nalleviation of symptoms, again rather\nlike Fresher\u2019s Flu. However mumps is\na notifiable disease, which means that\nthe doctors have a legal responsibility\nto report cases to the Health Protection Agency (HPA), who monitor outbreaks of infectious disease in the UK.\nSo if most people get better on their\nown, why bother? Well in a minority\nof cases there can be complications.\nThese include inflammation of the lining of the brain (viral meningitis- NOT\nthe life-threatening form), deafness\n(which usually recovers fully) and or-chitis. Orchitis is inflammation of the\ntesticle(s), which tends to only occur\nin males, of course. It is probably the\nmost famous complication of mumps\ninfection, I expect because of the discomfort it can cause. The equivalent\noophritis (inflammation of the ovary)\nin females is not usually noticed so\neasily. It is widely thought that orchitis\nand oophritis can have an effect on future fertility, but in fact the data on this\nis questionable.\nThe HPA found that mumps was occurring in 3 yearly cycles of epidemics\nin young children. In response to these\nthe government introduced a vaccination for mumps, which was launched\nin 1988 combined with the pre-exist-ing jabs for measles and rubella (at one\ntime only for girls), as the MMR. This\nhalted the epidemics in young children,\nbut resulted in an increase in mumps\nin teenagers, who of course hadn\u2019t received the vaccinations. Indeed, most\npeople born before 1990 i.e. the majority of College intake, will not have routinely received the recommended two\ndoses of MMR.\nSo, take:\n\u2022 One large group of teenagers, born\nbefore 1990, many of whom haven\u2019t\nhad two MMRs;\n\u2022 Add a few people from abroad, say\nfor example a country where there is\nno MMR programme;\n\u2022 Mix in a confined space, say for example College Halls;\n\u2022 Shake well in a Fresher\u2019s Week social with a few glasses of alcohol and\na splash of saliva (in say, an \u201cintimate\nkiss\u201d).\n\u2022 Wait 2 weeks\nand enjoy a fresh Mumps Outbreak.\nIt\u2019s that simple.\nWe do our best to avoid such an\noutbreak in our student population.\nWe need to see those who think they\nhave it to diagnose it properly and\ntake appropriate action. You need to\nhave had two MMR vaccinations, after\nwhich you are extremely unlikely to get\nmumps.\nOnce again, and perhaps not for the\nlast time: MMR (and meningitis C)\nvaccination is free to the under 25s,\nand is available from the Health Centre. See the grey box-out to the left for\ndetails on our new location, where you\ncan get said vaccination.\nIf you hadn\u2019t noticed that the Health Centre is in a temporary build-ing, you wouldn\u2019t be the first. The Porta-cabins in SW7 can hardly\nbe described as \u201chuts\u201d. We\u2019ve been here just over 2 years now and\nalthough we love it, we are looking forward to moving into our fan-tastic, brand new, purpose-built premises at our old location in Southside, under Tizard Hall.\nThe move is over the weekend of 3rd and 4th November. We will be\nproviding EMERGENCY services only on Friday 2nd and Monday 5th\nNovember, and open for business as usual (amongst the removals\nboxes) on Tuesday 6th November.\nOur address and telephone numbers (Reception: 02075846301) will\nremain the same.\nPlease request any repeat prescriptions before Tues 30th Oct and as\nusual allow 2 working days for these to be processed.\nAt this time of year things can start to\nget on top of you, the days and nights\nare colder, work has now started to pile\nup and deadlines need to be met, however also at this time of year the clocks\ngo back.\nThis means that the nights will start\nto get dark at 4pm, therefore many of\nyou will be walking home in the dark\nfrom lectures or from your social activ-ities, making it easier for people wishing to do wrong as people\u2019s awareness\nis often clouded because the darkness.\nYour personal safety is paramount\naround this time and it is important\nthat you are aware of your personal\nsurroundings and of the steps you can\ntake if you find yourself in times of\ndifficulty.\nThe Information and Advice Centre can help if you have any concerns\nregarding personal safety and we also\ngive out free personal attack alarms\nand give free booklets to students\nwhich can give you common sense advice when walking the streets at night.\nBelow are a few quick tips for you to\ntake on board:\n\u2022 If you are going out make sure you\nknow where you are going and you\nhave a planned route, it is sometimes\ngood to tell people where you are going\nif you are travelling on your own.\n\u2022 When walking around look confi-dent, be purposeful and alert to your\nsurroundings. People who look confident are less likely to be attacked.\n\u2022 Try to avoid taking shortcuts\nthrough dark alleys or parks, as this\nwill increase the amount of risk you\nwill be in as it will often be dark and\nhard to see what is around you.\n\u2022 Try not to draw attention to your\nvaluables especially at night. Keep\nthings like mobile phones and iPods\nwell hidden from people.\n\u2022 Avoid walking passed parked cars\nwith their engines running and people\nsitting in them.\n\u2022 If you are travelling by bus try to sit\nnear the driver or if by train, try to sit\nin a busy carriage.\nIt\u2019s also important to be aware that\nwhen you\u2019re travelling home late at\nnight you consider the type of the\ntransport you are getting into. London has quite a big problem with unlicensed mini-cabs\n\u2022 If you\u2019re stranded somewhere and\nneed to take a taxi ensure that you use\na licensed mini-cab or black taxi.\n\u2022 It is always better to book a taxi in\nadvance rather than trying to hail one\nlate at night.\n\u2022 If you can, try to share a cab home\nwith friends.\n\u2022 Confirm the details of the cab driver before entering the car to ensure it\nactually is your cab.\n\u2022 Make sure you sit in the back if you\nare on your own and ensure that you\nleave all doors unlocked.\nIf you do happen to be the victim of\nIC Health Centre is moving\ncrime it is important that you contact\nthe police to report this or if it occurs\non campus then to contact college\nsecurity.\nObviously being a victim of crime\ncan also affect you afterwards in your\ndaily life and can often make you nervous of people and of going about your\ndaily business. If you are feeling quite\nanxious after being a victim of crime\nthere is help out there in the form of\nvictim support, their contact details\nare: 0845 30 30 900\nFor more advice on staying safe\naround campus please call 020\n7594 8067 or you can send an\nemail to us at advice@imperial.\nac.uk\nA very smart lady getting vaccinated\nNigel Cooke\nStudent Adviser\nDavid Hayton\nIC Health Centre Assistant GP\n\n"

Both competitors\nwere strong, easily gobbling down the\nfirst three chillies. The fairness of the\ncontest was momentarily brought into\nquestion by the baying audience as it\nwas discovered that Jov was eating\nchewing gum with his chillies. Nevertheless, the contestants arrived at\nthe final chilli and nothing seemed to\nbe able to stop them. The Chillies Of\nDeath\u2122 were consumed by both contestants and the round was declared a\ndraw with neither person particularly\nkeen on eating more fire.\nThis progress by the Sabbs' would be\nbuilt upon in the next round by Ally\n\"The Firebreather\" Cott. Fearlessly,\nAlly gulped down the first chilli as his\nopponent Umar Patel was still picking\noff the stalk. Ally breezed through the\nfollowing two rounds and by now the\naudience was gob smacked at his chilli\neating prowess. Claims were made that\nhis beard had something to do with\nthis success, but these remain totally\nunfounded. Inevitably, and rather unfortunately for Umar, Ally easily swallowed the final chilli. Umar couldn't\ntake the heat and with tears beginning\nto stream down his face, he gave in.\n1-1.\nIt was going to come right down\nto the wire. Kirsty Patterson was up\nagainst Nicole Ahmed to decide who\nwould win the first round of Challenge\nthe Sabbs. The contestants took their\nseats and slowly began to munch on\nthe first chillies. Strangely enough, the\nfirst chilli was actually hotter than the\nsecond, but both contestants managed\nit. However, during the second round\nNicole set the pace, quickly biting\nthrough chunks of chilli going against\nthe wishes of her watering eyes. Kirsty\nwas clearly not enjoying the jalapenos\nfrom hell. A verbal battering was coming down upon her from her opponent\nand it all became too much. Kirsty conceded defeat and that was it; the Sabbs\nlost. Hands were shaken, Islamic Society was declared victorious winning\n2-1 and much milk was drunk to settle\nthe stomachs and prevent the chillies\nfrom rearing their ugly heads in digested form.\nThe two teams gathered together for\na final photo, but the Sabbs were missing one team member in the form of\nJov. Unfortunately, the Felix Sport Editor had had to dash to the nearest toilet\nto bring up the ice-cream which was\noriginally intended as a cooling agent.\nThe afternoon was punishing on\nstomachs, with many suffering the\nconsequences of their consumption\nway after the event had finished. Yet it\nwas a fantastic opener to the Challenge\nthe Sabbs season. The two teams were\nultra-competitive, but the banter never\nslipped beyond cheeky digs.\nThis writer would like to thank Islamic Society for helping organise a\nfun, action packed event, for providing\nthe chillies and necessary fire quenching ice cream and milk.\nThe next challenge will not result in\nSabb defeat.

Is Blake being metaphoric, figurative\nor is there any truth in the\nwords of this iconic poem?\nChristians amongst you will recognise the words from the much-loved\nhymn \u2018Jerusalem\u2019. According to one\nsource, there is a whole lot of truth in\nBlake\u2019s poem and that Christianity was\nbrought to England, by Christ- Gildas\nthe wise, not Jesus. Not only is there\nno evidence of Nazareth (Jesus\u2019 birth\nplace) in Jewish writings, but the King\nof England gave Joseph and Mary land\nfree of tax when they arrived in England. The assumption is that a supposedly pagan king would not lavish assets\non Mary and Joseph, two refugees,\nfor no good reason.

That\u2019s be-cause, whatever gmail doesn\u2019t pick up\nfor me, I just delete straight off.\nBut one man was made of sterner\nstuff than that. His name was Bob\nServant, and thanks to the incredible\nwork of Neil Forsyth, you can now read\nthe results of his exploits.\nAdmittedly, Bob Servant\u2019s true existence is debated. But the transcripts\ncontained within Forsyth\u2019s Delete This\nAt Your Peril are entirely genuine. Bob\nServant \u2013 or perhaps Forsyth... \u2013 responded to get-rich-quick schemes,\npromises of love, claims of excitement\nin Nigeria, and although no money\never changes hands, the emails are\npriceless.\nThey work on a tried and tested formula \u2013 someone\u2019s trying to con money\nout of Bob Servant. We\u2019ve all read the\nemails, but hopefully not replied. Forsyth outlines the basic scams at the beginning of the book \u2013 all have a similar\nconclusion, that Bob manages to avoid\nin spectacular style.\nThe book alternates between the\ncorrespondents and reads relatively\nquickly, but it\u2019s so well composed that\nyou\u2019re almost envious of the fun that\nwas evidently had in making it. Some\nsections come particularly close to the\nbone \u2013 once you realise that those on\nthe other end of Bob\u2019s emails are lying through their teeth, their stories\nof love, betrayal and wealth become\nquite saddening. But it always delivers laughs, most incredulous, at how\nor perhaps why the discussions were\nallowed to go on for so long. Dozens\nof emails are exchanged in each chap-ter, and all end in the same conclusion\n\u2013 lots of work by the spammer, but no\nmoney won.\nOne particularly brilliant exchange\nactually ends in a partial admission by\nBob that he\u2019s in the process of writing a book and that he\u2019d been stringing the guy along. This moment reads\nbrilliantly, as both sides admit to their\ndeception and the book takes on a new\nside.\nForsyth\u2019s other book, Other People\u2019s\nMoney, strides a similar line between\nhumour and quite a gripping fascination which we have with real crime,\nfollowing as it does one of the most\nnotorious credit card fraudsters of\nrecent times \u2013 Felix will be reviewing\nthis soon too.\nBut Delete This At Your Peril stands\nalone as a genuinely fascinating piece\nof e-entertainment that hits on something we\u2019ve all intimately experienced,\nand answers the question we\u2019ve all\nwondered \u2013 who exactly is on the other end of the line?\nWhether or not you normally go\nfor light humour such as this \u2013 and it\ndoes feel like a stocking filler rather\nthan a real, sit-down-and-absorb kind\nof book\u2013 it\u2019s highly recommended.\nPainfully funny in the same line as\nPhonejacker or The Office and a little\ndisturbing in a similar way, it\u2019s unlike\nanything I\u2019ve ever read before\u2013 which\nis probably a good thing because if this\nbook reminds you of anything, it\u2019s that\nthere\u2019s a good reason why the first thing\nyou do is reach for the delete button.\nWe\u2019ll be \u201cbook-crossing\u201d our copy\nlater this week.\nDelete This At Your Peril is\navailable in shops now.

When I came here 4 years ago\nthe place was not a building site, had\nsome of the best CAMRA bars and we\neven had grass areas where we could\nsit and drink beer or simply enjoy the\nsunshine. We even had a functioning\nlibrary, (Heaven forbid you would ac-The Imperial\nCollege garbage\nbin, luminous\nplastic and a\ngiant ashtray.\ntually want to go in there, especially\nnow).\nNow the students\u2019 perfect university world has been shattered by a guy\ncalled Bob and his jackhammer. Not a\nstone seems to have gone unturned in\nthe latest battle to turn everything at\nImperial into a heavy neon monstros-ity; vile shades of lime green, orange,\npink to name but a few (whoever the\narchitect is should be put up against\nthe wall and shot!). I also feel incredibly sorry for Southside residents\npaying \u00a3155 per week for unfinished\nbathrooms, no curtains and a marquee\ncommon room. That\u2019s more than the\nstudent loan!\nOur lovely Rector has taken our university a step too far; in bringing in the\nmajority of the world\u2019s foreign students\ninto our walls he is using the money to\ndo what exactly?\nDear Felix,\nI am writing to complain about the\nrecent disorganisation of the HumaniHumanities\ntimetable\ndebacle\nties department. This year I elected to\nstudy Spanish during lunchtimes. The\nHumanities website currently states\nunder the information about timetabling of foreign language courses (and\nhas done since the beginning of September at the very least): \u201cStudents\nwho have registered for these courses\nwill be emailed a timetable at the start\nof the autumn term. All courses start\nthe week commencing Monday 8 October 2007\u201d.\nSo I therefore waited for the timetable to arrive. On Friday 5th of October\nI still had not received a timetable, and\nso first thing on Monday I emailed Ms\nCatherine Chapouton, the Language\nSupport Administrator, to ask about\nthe situation, or who to see. I received\nno reply to my email. Having checked\nwith other friends who had enrolled on\nthe same course, I ascertained that no\none had received a timetable. I therefore assumed that the course must begin later in the week.\nOn Tuesday I received a message\nfrom a friend saying that the timetables were being displayed on the wall\nin the humanities department. I went\nup quickly, and found that I had a lecture that day at 12 (which fortunately\nI was able to make) and had missed a\nlecture on the Monday, also at 12.\nI went to the woman who was manning the Humanities information desk\nand complained that I had missed a\nclass because I was waiting for the\ntimetable, as instructed on the inter-net. She did not apologise and in my\nopinion did not even appear to be particularly interested. I expressed my dismay at the departmental administra-tion, but she barely acknowledged me.\nUpon my arrival at the lecture, I\napologised for missing the previous\nclass, only to find that the teacher was\nvery understanding, and that I was\nnot the only one. I then had to try and\ncatch up with the others who had made\nit the previous day, which was tough,\nas I had never studied Spanish before,\nand so the pronunciation which was\nstudied the previous day was difficult\nto go through on my own.\nAfter my lesson, I returned to my department and checked my emails. At\n13:17 I received an email, again from\nMs Catherine Chapouton stating the\nfollowing (quoted):\n\u201cYour first lesson will be at 1200-1300\nin EE 403B on Monday, 8 October\nLesson 1 is at 1200-1300 on Mondays\nin EE 403B\nLesson 2 is at 1200-1300 on Tuesdays\nin EE 403B\nLesson 3 is at 1200-1300 on Thursdays\nin EE 403B\u201d\nThis email was received 25 hours after\nthe course had started, in which case\n2 lectures would have been missed if\nmy friends and I had not visited the\ndepartment directly. This was the case\nfor some of the class who did indeed\nmiss two lectures.\nI am very disappointed that the Humanities Department did not bother to\nemail the timetables out in time for the\nbeginning of term. If this was impos-sible, then the department or perhaps\nMs Catherine Chapouton could have\nsurely have sent a one line email saying to come to the department? I was\nalso very disappointed with the way\nin which I was ignored and did not receive an apology or acknowledgment\nof my dismay at missing a lecture.\nThis is my final year at Imperial, and\nmy courses count a lot towards my final degree. In short, this is very important for me, and to be having to play\ncatch up from the very beginning is\nvery undesirable.\nThe College expects students to be\ncourteous to all staff. It is disappointing\nthat the Humanities Department does\nnot extend this respect to its students.\nSally Longstaff\nAero Year 4\nInterestingly, although many buildings are going up, other things are being removed! For example, outside the\nRSM building there used to be a smokers bin, now this has inexplicably been\nremoved, and replaced with nothing.\nIs this supposed to stop smoking, because it doesn\u2019t and now the entire\nalcove has turned into a giant ashtray\n(and it doesn\u2019t smell good). What do\npeople think the smokers are stubbing\nout on? Yup, Imperial College\u2026 Maybe\nthat\u2019s all it is good for now.\nI was under the impression that Imperial was a \u201cgreen\u201d university; a conscientious one that cares about the\nenvironment and wants to reduce its\ncarbon footprint. Fat chance, perfectly\nordinary light bulbs have been replaced\nwith neon dancing floors, giant bauble\nlights, lights in the walkway, pretty\nmuch everywhere, and they never get\nturned off! Not just this but a startling\nabsence of hand driers (in the new\n\u201cimproved\u201d facilities) is causing paper\ntowels to find a home on the floor.\nAlongside the chronic disappearance\nof ladies\u2019 sanitary bins, this doesn\u2019t\nmake for good reading. All this money\nfrom foreign investment, and it\u2019s being\nwasted on luminous plastic that even\nZebedee would have been proud of!\nSo I pose the question, what the hell\nis going on? Imperial needs to stop\nknocking down buildings, and think\nabout it\u2019s students once more. This is a\nuniversity not a business!\nA pissed off student!\nICGA \u2013 Imperial College Giant Ashtray\nThe Global Health Forum meets\nweekly to discuss issues relating to\nhealth and medicine in the world in\nwhich we live. On Tuesday 30th October, at 6.30 in the SAF building we consider the growing the obesity epidemic\nand discuss some radical solutions to\nit \u2013 \u201cFat tax: should it be \u00a3 for lb?\u201d\nReports published this week confirm\nthat the rise in obesity is truly a global\nphenomenon, and one which the UK is\ntaking an active (or rather sedentary)\npart. Although it may be tempting to\nmock the Americans and how fat they\nare, Britain has chosen to obediently\nfollow in their footsteps. Earlier this\nmonth the government published the\nForesight report; a major study of Britain\u2019s obesity epidemic. Their conclu-sion, being an expletive, can\u2019t be published in these pages, but essentially\nthis is a huge and growing problem in\nproportion to the diameter of its sub-jects. Other data released this month\nclaim that almost one in four adults are\nobese. We truly are the fat man of Europe \u2013 the obesity rate in this country is\nalmost twice that in Germany (12.9 per\ncent) and two and a half times that in\nFrance (9.4 per cent.) Unsurprisingly,\npredictions for the future are dire: half\nthe population will be obese within 25\nyears and by 2050, obesity will cost the\nObesity: Should it be \u00a3 for lb?\ncountry \u00a345bn a year, half the current\nNHS budget.\nThe scale of the problem has led the\nhealth secretary, Alan Johnson to describe obesity as a \u201cpotential crisis on\nthe scale of climate change.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s response to the latest raft of reports has been timid. Alan\nJohnson is believed to be considering\ninforming parents weight measurements of their children at ages 5 and\n10. Monitoring the demise in health of\nthe nation\u2019s children is like timing how\nfast the ship is sinking, and doesn\u2019t\nreally address anything. No, what we\nneed is radical thinking, and fast.\nProfessor Le Grant, chair of Health\nEngland committee, has one such suggestion addressing not just obesity,\nbut unhealthy living in general. Dismissing as nihilistic the conclusions\nof the Foresight report who refer to\nan \u201cobesegenic\u201d culture within society,\nLe Grant feels we should reverse our\nthinking of \u201cchoosing healthy lifestyle\u201d\nand instead make that the default. His\npolicies would include having to apply\nfor a permit to smoke cigarettes, strict\nrestrictions for salt in preprocessed\nfoods, enforcing employers to provide\nfree fruit and time allocated during\nthe day for exercise. Cigarette permits\ncould be issued annually requiring individuals to \u201copt-in\u201d each year to being\na smoker, rather than \u201copting out\u201d by\nchoosing to give up. Defending accusations that this is these are the actions of\nan overbearing state, Le Grant points\nout that if people wished to continue\nto live unhealthily, they were perfectly\nentitled to, but would have to apply to\nsmoke, add their own salt to food, and\nopt out of exercise at work.\nThis is radical thinking, and some\nwould argue, an unworkable proposi-tion. I\u2019m inclined, however, to have\nsympathy with it. But perhaps we\nshould go further \u2013 some have argued\ncharging those who \u201cself inflict\u201d illness\nshould have to pay for their indiscre-tions. True, we all suffer through those\nwho \u201cindulge\u201d in unhealthy practices\nand drain public resources; has the\ntime come for punitive financial meas-ures?\nJoe Ward &\nStephen Mullin\nFat tax: Solution to Britain\u2019s obesity crisis?\n\u201c\nWithin 25\nyears, obesity\nwill cost the\ncountry half of\nthe current NHS\nbudget\n\u201d\n\n"

Books!\nThanks to the rather lovely people\nat Picador publishing, we\u2019ve got\nour hands on copies of the entire\nOtori series, including a hardcover\nversion of the latest book Heaven\u2019s\nNet Is Wide.\nInstead of Bookcrossing these as\nwe might normally find ourselves\ndoing, we\u2019ve decided to go the\nwhole hog and give this rather special prize the competition treat-ment, and in the spirit of all things\noriental, we\u2019d like you to write us\na Haiku.\nHaikus are poems with strict\nrules \u2013 three lines long, five syllables on the first and last lines, seven syllables in the middle.

Michael Cook promises you won\u2019t have seen it all before\nT\nhere\u2019s a particular kind\nof fiction book on shop\nshelves at the moment\nthat\u2019s undergone something of an identity crisis\nover the last decade or so. It\u2019s identifiable by a few telling factors \u2013 firstly,\nthere\u2019s a young protagonist, probably\nhormonally challenged. There\u2019s normally the discovery of some unbelievable skill, which will help overcome\nsome great evil and the whole thing\u2019s\nusually wrapped up in an extended\nmetaphor the size of the author\u2019s ego\n(I\u2019m looking at you, Philip Pullman),\nperhaps lightly dusted with hopes for\na film licence.\nThe identity crisis comes because\nno-one\u2019s sure who\u2019s supposed to read\nthem. It took adult readers a good few\nyears to realise that Harry Potter was\nreadable fun. Booksellers spent ages\nselling the first two books of the Dark\nMaterials trilogy to eleven year-olds,\nonly for the last book to be released and\nread like\nthe bastard offspring\nof Nietzsche\nand Woody Allen. It all whirls together\nto make the \u201cteen fiction\u201d shelf of Waterstones a minefield of generic fantasy\nand high-brow meta-meta-philiosophy\nthat most would rather not touch.\nTales Of The Otori is a book series\nstranded at the centre of this genre.\nBut fortunately, it\u2019s well worth braving\nthe explosions to pluck out.\nThe books are written by Lian Hearn,\na pen name for children\u2019s author Gillian\nRubinstein, who travelled and studied\nJapanese culture extensively during her\nlife, before settling down to write the\nfive-book series that now draws to an\nend with its latest release.\nInterestingly, they\u2019re not actually\nset in Japan, rather taking place in a\nstrangely generic far-eastern penin-sula, in a medieval/feudal-like period.\nFrom Hearn\u2019s point of view, it allows\nfor much-needed flexibility in terms of\nmajor events, and from your point of\nview it\u2019s probably just as well as if your\nknowledge of medieval Japan is anything like mine, you\u2019d be lost.\nThe lack of specification about the\nsetting doesn\u2019t detract from the detail,\nthough; the world is very real, and even\nfeatures a twee is-it-just-me-or-is-this-a-bit-much map at the start of each\nbook. The customs, religions and beliefs are all equatable \u2013\nmany exactly so \u2013 to similar ones in\n\u2018real\u2019 Japan, and as the characters travel\nthrough locations again and again over\nthe series\u2019 many decades, the layers of\nlife are built up very smoothly.\nSo,theauthor\u2019sexperienced,thewriting is rich, where\u2019s the catch and why\ndoes Harry Potter feature in the opening paragraph? Well, here\u2019s a summary\nof the first part of Across The Nightingale Floor, Hearn\u2019s first book:- whilst in\nhiding from persecution, a young boy\nwitnesses his family\u2019s murder at the\nhands of an evil warrior, runs away and\nis saved by a kindly-yet-aging man who\nrecognises his unrivalled special abilities and promptly takes him off to be\ntrained.\nNow, admittedly, it gets a bit more\nvaried after that. Takeo, as the boy is\nknown, grows up to be the successor to\nhis saviour, Lord Shigeru, and we follow the politics, war, romance and philosophy of Takeo\u2019s life as he wrestles\nto unite the clans of the surrounding\nlands. But the problem is that the book\nfeels very bland at first touch. The boy\nhas superpowers. He falls in love with\na princess. You can\u2019t sell that easily to\npeople who would already have turned\nit down just from the shelf it was on.\nIt\u2019s made worse by the length of the\nbooks. The first three \u2013 Across The\nNightingale Floor, Grass For His Pillow\nand Brilliance Of The Moon \u2013 are all\nreasonably sized, charting Takeo\u2019s union of the clans. The Harsh Cry Of The\nHeron, written to close up the story, is\nalmost the same size as the last three\nput together, and this last book, a prequel to all four others, is even larger.\nThough Heaven\u2019s Net Is Wide is a good\npiece of fiction that ties up the series\nwell, it\u2019s a marathon for casual readers-especially those who can\u2019t remember\nthe complex and long lists of family\nmembers, clans and battles.\nSo it\u2019s a bit generic, really long and\noriginally written for people younger\nthan you. Why are you going to bother\nwith it? It\u2019s because Hearn\u2019s writing\nstyle manages something very special,\nand rarely seen in books for her target\nmarket \u2013 Tales Of The Otori is epic.\nYes, Harry Potter was seven books but\nit was too tied down to the school \u2013 so\nmuch was hinted at but never explored.\nYes, his Dark Materials covered, well,\nmultiple universes, God and the entirety of existence but Pullman breezed\nthrough it all so quickly that you saw\nvirtually nothing of it.\nHearn\u2019s world is intricate and beauti-ful. Every journey is a mammoth\nexcursion, every off-hand allusion to\nsomething is followed up by another\ncharacter or chapter. The Otori clan\u2019s\nmany alliances and betrayals, as well\nas Takeo\u2019s battle with the source of his\nextraordinary skills, allows for a wide\nrange of plot arcs, that covers a wide\nrange of storytelling traditions. The\ncast of reluctant warriors, ruthless female rulers, clandestine monks, pious\nheretics, faithful outcasts, loyal warriors \u2013 each deserving of a story of their\nown \u2013 are all given that story here.\nThere are no secondary characters in\nthese books, and it\u2019s this that makes\nthem so strong.\nYou\u2019re not going to walk away from\nthem feeling you\u2019ve read a groundbreaking piece of fiction. But it\u2019s solid,\npowerful, and above all else excit-ing. Hearn\u2019s original trilogy should be\nconsidered a must-read, and the two\nrecent follow-ups are probably worthwhile for the fans too. It\u2019s time to learn\nlessons from a decade of Rowling, and\nstart opening our eyes to the cookie-cutter crime thrillers and predictable\nyuppy romance stories currently on\nthree-for-two; Tales of the Otori is\nrich winter reading, irregardless of\npreconceptions.\nAll of the books in the Tales Of\nThe Otori series are out now,\npublished by Picador. The first\nthree novels can be bought in\na box set for around \u00a39.99 on\nAmazon. Heaven\u2019s Net Is Wide is\nnow in Hardback for \u00a312.99.\n\n"

    "content": "19\nFriday 26 October 2007 felix\nof the brilliant conditions and fantastic\nscenery highlighted by recent European Championships held at Rayskala. In\ntotal, sixteen icGC members went on\ntour, including four assistant instruc-tors, two of which had nothing better\nto do than stay for the whole month!\nHaving arrived in Finland after an\nepic two day drive, we found the club\nvery friendly, welcoming, and well kit-ted out! What first strikes you on takeoff is the awesome beauty of the loca-tion. Lakes shimmer like mirrors, with\nthe glider\u2019s reflection slipping beneath\nthe shining wings, and from horizon to\nhorizon green fields, forests and lakes!\nWithin the first few days we had already started to explore the local area,\nsome pilots doing cross countries up to\n400km, pottering at 90kph, whilst others gained their Silver durations and\nflew dual cross countries in the two-seater. Well done to Rory Condon and\nTom Sibley for their Silver durations,\nand commiserations to Claire Malpas\n\u2013 who needed relief \u2013 and Emma Worley, who ran out of day. Later on, Rory\nmanaged to complete the set with a\n160km Silver distance! Other achievements early on included a first single-seater flight by Christian Morsbach.\nAway from the airfield, we did as the\nFinns do: drank plenty of beer, and enjoyed some sauna and larking about in\nthe lake. Very little sleep was had ini-tially, because in early July it never gets\ndark, and we had no idea what time it\nwas! Night time is just one big sunset\nthat turns into sunrise again, and no\nphotograph can quite do the experience justice: it is truly breathtaking.\nOccasionally we lost a few days to\nrainy weather, it never got as bad as\nthe UK \u2013 no new lakes were formed\n\u2013 but this allowed us to enjoy Finnish culture, by visiting Helsinki, and of\ncourse Moomin World! Another thing\nworthy of note is the \u2018Harmageddon\u2019,\nan extremely spicy pork dish served by\na pub local to the airfield: it has its own\nhealth warning, and Shaun Murdoch\ncan personally confirm that it deserves\nit!\nGetting back to gliding, almost every\nflyable day we found was soarable to\nsome degree. The forests seemed to\nbe an excellent store of energy, while\nthe lakes worked as\nthe trigger. On\ngood days, it was\nsoarable from\nabout 8am to\n8pm, and Rayskala\nwill give launches at\n10pm if you like! Cloud\nbases were anything from\n6000 to 9000 feet, with good\n4-9 knot thermals, which isn\u2019t\ntoo bad really. Only in Finland\nwould you consider going off\ncross-country at 6pm! This gives\na really very long day, which is\ngreat when you have six people to fly\nand three gliders: everyone can have as\nmuch soaring and training as they can\ntake! With multiple instructors, at least\ntwo at all times, there was ample opportunity for everyone to get what they\nwanted out of the expedition.\nOn planning the expedition, the\ncommittee had declared one little extra goal: for the two-seater Grob 103 to\nfly further than it ever had done previ-ously: a 527km triangle task. In the last\nweek, the day to do it finally arrived so\nSage Shah and Shaun Murdoch got to\nit. Before leaving, the tour members\nwere all interviewed by the Helsingin\nSannomat, the most widely circulated\nnewspaper in Scandinavia, who were\nvery interested in why we had travelled\nNorth for the summer. Their photographer took photos of them setting\noff on task, and later commented that\nshe didn\u2019t realise Finland had so many\nlakes! The story was run the next day,\nand icGC officially became an internationally known club!\nBack on task, things went well for\nmost of the run, staying high to remain\nin glide of land-able sites; the pilots\nwere enjoying an awesome view, and\nequally good thermals. They had to\ncross a few areas of poor thermal activ-ity, which slowed them down, but they\ncompleted the first 300km unevent-fully. Then the top cover started coming in, and they tiptoed along, trying\nto edge closer to where the sun was on\nthe ground. Arriving at the second turn\npoint, Oripaa Airfield, at about 6:30pm\n\u201cNight time is\njust one big\nsunset that turns\ninto sunrise\nagain\u201d\n\u201c8 hours of\nflying time...\n422km wasn\u2019t a\nbad effort\u201d\nthey hung on for ages in the blue,\nand eventually picked up a 3knot\nthermal to start on their way home.\nUnfortunately, that second thermal\nthat would have actually got them\nmost of the way back to Rayskala\nnever came, and they landed in a\nfield at around 7:30pm after well\nover 8 hours of flying time! Still,\n422km wasn\u2019t a bad effort! Jamie\nDenton, who had set off on the\nsame task but in an ASW-24, got\nback and completed the task: well\ndone him!\nAll in, this very adventurous expedition \u2013 the furthest icGC has\nbeen in some years, with the most\ngliders \u2013 was very well worth it!\nThe view from the air is spectacular and the sheer level of soaring and cross country that can be\nachieved in such a short space of\ntime is truly phenomenal. The people are friendly, and the lifestyle is\nfun: great for a holiday, even better for a gliding holiday! I am sure\nicGC will return there in the not so\ndistant future.\nIf you want to come and try\ngliding for yourself, come\nalong to one of our meetings\non Fridays at 12:30pm in\nAeronautics Room 254. We try\nto fly every weekend, using\nminibuses or members cars\nto get to Lasham. A trial flight\ncosts \u00a335 and includes a 20\nminute flight. Membership of\nthe club is \u00a340 per year, and\nan average flight costs around\n\u00a310. Email the Captain emma.\nworley@ic.ac.uk for more\ninformation or come to the\nmeetings and ask questions!\n\n"

I\u2019m a 5th year medic (and\nan IC post-grad) and I want your vote\nas one of the Undergraduate Medicine\nCouncillors in the upcoming elections.\nThis is my third year on the medical\nschool Students\u2019 Union, this year culminating in Deputy President.\nIn holding a position on our faculty\nunion I think it shows my existing\ncommitment to dealing with all issues\nconcerning students within ICSM,\nfrom welfare, to education to maintaining our own identity within the\nuniversity. Being in the role of Deputy\nPresident of ICSM this year leaves me\nuniquely experienced to know what is\ngoing on both within our faculty union\nand currently to a certain extent within\nIC union.\nI promise to represent you all to the\nbest of my knowledge and ability so\nplease vote for me as the best candidate to represent ALL students within\nour medical school on ICU Council.\nAbubakar Mohammed and Amir Sepehripour are also running for\nthis position, but failed to submit a manifesto.\nUndergraduate Councillors\nMark Chamberlain\nTiffany Munroe-gray\nJames Dearden\nMonal Patel\nSaras Chauhan\nNimesh Patel Aneesha Verma\nTo sit on Union Council in a role to represent the views of medics would be a\ngreat privilege, one I feel uniquely well\nplaced to undertake. Over my last 3\nyears at Imperial, I have been involved\nin many ways with the Medics\u2019 Union,\nand so a move to somewhere where I\ncan express the views of our students\nin a constructive way would allow me\nto contribute fully to the Students\u2019 Union, and especially the students whom\nI would be delegate for.\nHaving spent last year as Faculty Union Treasurer, I feel I am placed ideally with the knowledge of workings of\nboth ICU and the medical school, and\nwith a wealth of skills and abilities to\nengage students and the insight to help\npress on important issues. If elected\n\u2013 I would work hard with the other\nmembers of Council, and especially\nthose from my faculty, to ensure our\nstudents\u2019 interests are best voiced and\ndemonstrated.\nThe medics \u2013 who are they? Where do\nthey disappear to? What do they really\ndo?\nBelieve it or not, the medics and the\nnon medics are all part of Imperial\nCollege. That\u2019s where I\u2019d be involved\n\u2013 helping represent ICSM on the IC\nCouncil.\nWe are all faced with the similar issues at university whether it be travelling to campus or hospitals using\nthe \u2018cheap\u2019 Oyster, being homeless at\nthe start of term, or making IC social\nevents and sports suitable for all. Academically, we are also need of more\nresources and interactive learning\nto make sure IC Medics become the\ncountry\u2019s best doctors!\nIf you want your opinions heard and\nchanges made, choose Saras \u2013 the approachable and chatty (possibly bar-my) candidate who gets things done!\nShe can be found at all good ICSM/IC\nparties!\nMy name is James Dearden, and at\nthe moment I am a 5th year. Being in\nthe 5th year I have experience of both\nthe clinical and non-clinical aspects of\nour course and the problems that arise\nwithin them. Consequently I feel that\nI can suitably represent the academic\ninterests of the ICSM within the Union\nCouncil.\nI am also well connected to most of\nthe sports clubs and societies within\nthe faculty and am keen to see the Union continue to support and fund them\nwhile maintaining the individuality of\nthe medic clubs.\nSince I was the Reynolds Bar Manager last year, I believe I have both good\norganisation and management skills,\nas well as a strong desire to see the\nReynolds and the social aspect of the\nmedical school remain a central hub of\nmedic activity!\nPlease vote for me! I won\u2019t\ndisappoint!\nCurrently in my 4th year at medical\nschool, I realise that we, the students,\nneed to take control of our university\nand make it work for us. We are fortunate that our Union is autonomous and\nthat College are tightly constrained on\nwhere they can intervene. I believe that\nwe should not be complacent about using this power to ensure that this university is a well rounded, well-funded\ninstitution and a supportive environ-ment, especially for medics, as we are\nhere for the longest in the IC student\nbody.\nI have gained the expertise for this\nrole through being involved in several clubs and societies. As director\nof Light Opera I am familiar with the\nadministrative hurdles involved. I am\nalso currently running for Year Representative to help maintain our academic standards.\nI should be the voice for medics because I am proactive, tenacious and\ncommitted.\nI\u2019m Monal Patel and I would like to\nbe your Undergraduate Medicine\nCouncillor.\nThe Council is the most powerful\ncommittee in ICU and the democratic\nvoice of our student body. It\u2019s vital that\nyou have someone representing you\nwho understands what is important to\nus, the students, and has the conviction to make that heard and happen. I\nbelieve I am that person.\nI\u2019ll ensure the views of undergraduate\nmedics are taken into account when it\ncomes to passing policies and taking\npositions on issues such as top-up fees,\nclubs and societies funding, welfare\nand a host of other issues.\nI am approachable, diplomatic and\nhave a wealth of experience of commit-tees/politics from college to university\nlevel, which I will use to work alongside the other medic representatives\nto do my level best for our med school\nand the union as a whole so please vote\nfor me!\nAs a member of Imperial College Union Council, I would represent undergraduate medicine to the best of my\nability.\nThe Council has a great impact on\npolicy, rules and regulations for the\nCollege and ensures the students are\nserved well. As a council member, I\nwould have impact on these policies,\nwhich affect all students; hence it is a\nvital role.\nIf voted, I would allocate time, ener-gy, enthusiasm and knowledge into my\nduty to help make the changes that will\nbenefit all the students.\nIt is important to make certain that\nstudent voices are heard, and that\nthey are well represented in all decision making, which will be a priority\nof mine.\nAs well as fulfilling a duty, there is\nalways opportunity to develop and utilise new skills in a positive manner.\nSo please, make sure you vote for me,\nthanks!\nI\u2019m Aneesha, a final year medical stu-dent, and I want to get involved in the\nCouncil so that I can voice the ideas,\nconcerns and expectations (!!) of medics when decisions that affect us are\nbeing made. Joking aside, I would\ndedicate myself to this role as it is an\nimportant one, which I will use to ensure that our best interests are served\nby the Union at all times.\nBeing a final year will stand me in\ngood stead, because my 6 (almost!)\nyears at Imperial mean that I can\nidentify with all of you at every stage\nof medical school, so allowing me to\nbetter understand and represent your\ninterests.\nI have worked with the Union (as\ncaptain of IC Women\u2019s 1st tennis team\nlast year), so this experience will serve\nme well in carrying out the role of Union Council Member. So, vote for me!\nDo you know how many decisions ICU\nCouncil make about issues affecting us\nmedical students? They make loads!\nWe need to be there to represent medics at ICU Council otherwise loads of\nthese choices will be made on our behalf without any of our say, especially\nsince medics are an under-represented\npart of the Imperial student body.\nAs a member of ICU Council I would\nmake sure that the ICSM point of view\nis always heard. I would constantly be\nin touch with our students and SU so\nthat I can do what is best for medics at\nICU Council. I\u2019d take time to listen to\ndifferent points of view to ensure that\nI\u2019m representing what people want.\nI am passionate about Imperial and\nhelping us grow stronger. I will aim to\nmaximise the ICSM influence and improve our standing in ICU to get some\ngreat results in the forthcoming year.\nNobody is running for the position of Postgraduate Medicine Councillor! You can get involved by\nattending the 2nd Council Meeting of term on 29th October, in the Union Dining Hall\n\n"

With massive\nincreases of the number of visitors to the site and\nin turn many more Club and Society memberships\nbeing purchased, we thought we would detail\nsome of these achievements whilst looking ahead\nto our new Club & Society focused functionality.\nLast October we began our first full academic year\nof selling our Club and Society memberships online.\nWe were pleasantly surprised by the number of Clubs\nand Societies that embraced this new system and\nactively encouraged their prospective members to\njoin online. Joining online not only made it easier and\nmore convenient for the want to be member, but\nalso saved the Club and Society Officers time and\nthe problem of carrying around large sums of money.\nDuring October 2006 we sold 2123 memberships\nonline and overall last academic year 7234. Sales\nof all products during last October was just over\n\u00a340,000.\nThis year we have seen a huge jump in the number of\ntransactions, products and memberships sold. Only\n24 days into the month, we have already sold 3151\nmemberships online a rise of 67% on this time last\nyear, a figure which we expect to rise to almost 85%.\nThis is great news for all our Clubs & Societies as\nthey continue to increase their levels of involvement\nyear on year.

    "content": "million kids walking about with it plastered across their weedy torsos. The\n\u201cI Hate Nu Rave\u201d print seems rather\nironic too, since half of Topman\u2019s recent stock is based upon the sudden\nand heart-stoppingly annoying influx of this said popular music trend.\nDay-glo pink will never be cool again.\nThe 1990s used it and abused it, and\nit should be left right back there in the\nLSD trip you had at a rave in \u201993.\nIt has got to the point where Topman is no longer following musically\nsourced trends, but are now creating\ntheir own trends for the drones to fol-low. Credit to their business acumen\nthough; they\u2019re now telling susceptible\nIndie kids what to buy, rather than letting them choose what to wear. However, these new \u2018trends\u2019 they put out\nevery couple of months are, down to a\nlevel, identical or just a simple variation\non an otherwise generic bit of clothing.\nThe \u201cwhite shirt\u201d campaign featured\nseveral high-end fashion designers creating a series of white shirts for Topman\u2019s \u201cDesign\u201d range. A white shirt is a\nwhite shirt. Even if you did spend \u00a3200\non one, who\u2019s going to notice?\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Sarah Skeete\nHas fashion lost its flair?\nThere came a point when I just looked\ndown at myself, looked up again, and\nwithin view there was someone wearing at least one, if not more, of the same\nthings as me. I neurotically buttoned\nup my jacket to avoid awkwardness\nand embarrassment, only to realise\nthere was someone next to me wearing\nan identical one too. I would\u2019ve been\nbetter off naked, rather than standing\nthere looking like a couple of rejects\nfrom the Topman modelling agency.\nI\u2019m not just about to slag Topman\nand their styles off, mind. Far from it,\nI think Topman is kitting out the youth\nof today in clothes that make us look\njust about presentable. Affordable,\ngood quality and stylish clothing make\nwhat used to be just another bloke\u2019s\nclothes shop, into an Indie kid\u2019s wet\ndream.\nIt\u2019s not Topman\u2019s fault that everyone\nwants to wear their clothes. I doubt\nthe Head Office cares if we all look like\ngeneric monkeys, not with the amount\nof revenue they rake in everyday. The\nopinion of Topman is so low that\nFashion has always been a major part\nof culture; when you learnt about the\nancient Greeks or Romans, what they\nwore was a crucial part of study. Each\nmajor development in history has a\ncorresponding advance in fashion. The\nmost inspiring example is the women\nof the early twentieth century who\nchanged fashion in order to become\npart of the war effort. Throughout his-tory, fashion has defined culture. However, in recent years, fashion has not so\nmuch \u2018defined\u2019 a generation, as become\na stagnant representation of celebrity.\nOur idea of fashion has been developed over the last few decades with the\ndevelopment of \u2018mass media\u2019. Once just\nfor the elite, runway shows have been\nbrought to the masses through maga-zines, newspapers and television. Our\nobsession with fashion has become so\nintense that we even have an award\nwinning television series about the\ncut-throat world of fashion journal-ism. Modern fashion has broken down\nthe ability to define class purely on the\nclothes we wear. With celebrities such\nas Sienna Miller being spotted shopping in Primark and Kate Moss launching her line at Topshop, it has become\nvirtually impossible to claim that the\nrich are still the reigning fashionistas.\nBut with this increasing accessibility\nto runway fashion trends, has fashion\nlost its credibility and innovation? Even\nin the early twentieth century, every\nera had a defining style; the twenties\nand the flapper dress, the forties and\nbig, glamorous red lips, the fifties and\nthe prom dress. What defines the early\npart of the new millennium, a mere revival of the last century?\nThis autumn/winter we\u2019re being encouraged to wear metallic eye makeup\nas seen on the catwalks at Matthew\nWilliamson and Donna Karen, but I\ncan\u2019t remember the last season metallic eye shadows weren\u2019t in. Big in the\nseventies and eighties, they hadn\u2019t been\nmost designer\u2019s first choice in a long\ntime, until now. For the last few years,\nmetallics have been huge and I can\u2019t\nsee them disappearing for a long while.\nAnother example of the stagnant nature of modern fashion is the revival of\nthe fringe after Kate Moss was spotted\nat Swarovski\u2019s Fashion Rocks sporting\na blunt fringe. The fringe has never\nbeen unpopular, Mischa Barton was\nseen with one throughout her time on\nThe OC, yet if someone else wears it,\nwe take it as a new trend.\nIf we were to define our generation,\nI\u2019d use the term \u201cmodern\u201d. Whenever\nyou hear anyone describe almost anything remotely linked to fashion they\nalways call it \u201cvery modern\u201d. Most runway shows now either exhibit a new\ntake on an old idea or something that\ncould\u2019ve been out of a space age movie.\n\u201cModern\u201d trends include metallics,\npatent accessories, feathers, which if\nyou wore together would look rather\nridiculous.\nHowever, if you walk down the street,\nit\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll see anyone wearing a\nsilver bubble dress with plastic, trans-The new \u2018Clones\u2019 range by Topman\nlucent platforms. The modern fashion-ista seems to prefer comfort over Naomi Campbell platforms. That\u2019s not to\nsay they completely dismiss glamour,\nthey just sometimes appreciate boots\nwith jeans or woolly tight, the kind\npopular with five year old girls coun-trywide. Fashion has become more\npersonal than it once was. Someone\ncan be \u201cfashionable\u201d without changing\ntheir wardrobe every season, which\nwould just be silly anyway as it\u2019ll probably be back next year!\nCelebrities such as Kate Moss and\nSienna Miller are critically acclaimed\nby the fashion media for their easy-to-do style. Both celebrities wear clothes\nthat us normal people can easily incorporate into our current wardrobe. Kate\nMoss\u2019s autumn line, recently launched\nat Topshop, showcased a basic wardrobe of shirts, waistcoats, t-shirts and\njeans. Her undeniable style comes from\nher ability to flit between comfortable\nyet inspired day-to-day clothing, and\nevening glamour.\nIt\u2019s with this rise of comfortable chic\nthat the flair in fashion has started to\nsubside. We no longer want to be told\nhow to dress so that we become clones\nof a designer; on the contrary we want\nto be our own designers every day. We\nwant inspiration to pick out a few key\npieces in shops; perhaps a waistcoat\none year, silver skirts another, but we\nwant to put it together ourselves. We\nwant to be able to wear UGG boots\nwith a vintage dress, it would probably\nbe more comfortable, or heels with\njeans, if it\u2019s cold when you get outside.\nIt\u2019s as though as day-to-day wear becomes more sensible, designers play\nwith old styles more and more, almost\nto the point of absurdity. It\u2019s high street\nshops which take these pieces and produce them for the general public.\nIt\u2019s the combination of the obsession with celebrity and the accessibility of high end fashion which provides\nus with the necessary inspiration, but\nultimately we all dress ourselves, style\ncomes from within.\neven their Marketing Director, David\nShepard announced unhesitently to\nthe world that the only reason anyone\nwould ever buy a Topman suit would\nbe for their \u2018first courtcase\u2019, because\nwe\u2019re all Pete Doherty wannabes at\nheart. Just a quick tip too; if you absolutely have to get embroiled in a law-suit, don\u2019t turn up to court in a trilby.\nI\u2019ll personally come down there and\nmock you myself. In fact, I\u2019ll take the\nstand and give evidence against you.\nJust to spite you further.\nTopman produces clones. It\u2019s undeni-able. There is evidence everywhere you\nlook. Literally. There are people priding themselves on the fact everything\nthey buy and own is from Topman.\nIt\u2019s like the issue of hooligans priding\nthemselves on the fact they have an\nASBO. They think it\u2019s cool, but it just\ndeems them a menace to society.\nT-shirts with oh-so profound messages of the \u201cFrankie Says Relax\u201d style\nhave become horrendously popular\nrecently. The pseudo-political mes-sage, such as \u201cMake Music Not Missiles\u201d has now just become a worthless\nand meaningless phrase, thanks to the\nThin as a statement\nIntroducing the new WoW diet:\nplay so much that you don\u2019t eat,\nlose weight. Don\u2019t kid yourself into\nthinking that a large size t-shirt\nwill make you manly. It will make\nyou look anorexic. Buy clothes\nthat fit you.\nShirts with long sleeved tops\nA.k.a. Seth from the OC. I\u2019m\nthinking of a thin striped or\nchecked shirt, neutral colour with\ndark long sleeved top underneath.\nAny man can pull this off. Some\nwill even look good.\nSocks and sandals\nNo no no no no no no no no no\nno *takes deep breath* no no no\nno no. Despite the fashion world\nand, indeed, anyone with any\nsemblance of taste taking this and\nmaking it into a geek fashion clich\u00e9, there are still people with an\nunwavering belief that it is ok to\nwear this combination of foot-wear. It is not.\nBlack\nBlack clothing, particularly t-shirts, makes anyone without a\nslight tan look like they\u2019ve spent\nthe past year and a half in an underground computing lab. Oh,\nyou have? Let\u2019s try and not make\nthis situation any worse than it already is.\nShort sleeved shirts\nWith a tie? Without a tie? Doesn\u2019t\nmatter; looks awful.\nT-Shirts with formulae on\nthem\nOK, so the SciFi Soc t-shirt proclaims your unwavering allegiance\nto reading dense, often poorly\nwritten works of fiction, and even\nI have to admit at being impressed\nat the use of Greek (psi and phi,\nanyone?) but as a fashion state-ment, it just doesn\u2019t work. Especially not when teamed with unwashed jeans and trainers.\nFrancesca Buckland\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, you can look\npretty sharp if you buy an entire outfit\nfrom Topman; but only if there\u2019s noone else in a 500 metre radius. However, Topshop doesn\u2019t seem to have the\nsame detrimental affect on general civ-ilisation. But I suppose when you have\na 20 ft stick insect such as Kate Moss\nplastered across the shop window, everyone is too busy trying not to gag outside to even enter the stores anymore.\nMy humble advice would be to\nchoose items selectively from Topman. Topman always has and always\nwill stock some more subtler items\namongst the latest fashion craze. At\nthe moment, it\u2019d probably be the variety of plain \u2018baseball\u2019 collared T-shirts;\nsimple basics that adds that stylish\nTopman twist to an otherwise generic\nT-shirt and jeans combo.\nGood and moderately priced \u2018alternative\u2019 clothing is hard to come by in\nthe UK, and as students, its hard to\nresist the temptation of inexpensively\nkeeping up with the trends that Topman sets for us. However, it comes at\nthe cost of individuality. We were all\ncreated uniquely; express it.\nDaniel Wan\nSasha Nicoletti\nGeek chic\n101101001\nKate Moss\u2019s autumn line up is at a Topshop near you now, but has fashion\u2019s credibility declined?\n29\nFriday 26 October 2007 felix\n\n"

Lets\ndiscuss.\nLet me tell you now, forget what\nyou have read about in magazines and\nnewspapers or seen on TV - doing a\nmillion and one abdominal exercises\nwill never get you a flat stomach. Okay\nnow for the good news - everyone has\na flat stomach. Unfortunately most\npeople tend to have a certain amount\nof body fat covering it. This fat, ladies\nand gentlemen, cannot be burnt off by\ndoing stomach after stomach exercise.\nA balanced healthy diet and plenty of\nvaried exercise is the only way to reduce body fat. Fat reduction and the\nbest methods of achieving it will be\ndiscussed in future articles.\nSo if in order to get a flat stomach\nwe need to eat well and exercise more,\nwhy do we do abdominal exercises at\nall? Well, exercising the abdominal\nmuscles will make them bigger just like\nany other muscle as long as you use the\ncorrect number of repetitions and sets\nand are taking in the right nutrition and\nlevels of rest. However the increase in\nsize is unlikely to be noticeable to any\ngreat degree and unless you have a low\nbody fat percentage you are not going\nto see any real definition anyway.\nThe main reason we should train the\nabdominal muscles is to aid the stability and support of our spine and pelvis\nduring the movement of our arms and\nlegs and as a link in the kinetic chain to\ntransfer force from the legs up through\nto the arms. While we are talking about\nstability and support let me clear up a\ncommon misunderstanding - abdominal training is not core training. The\nabdominal muscles are some of the\nmajor contributing muscles of the core\nbut training them does not mean you\nare training your core. The core is an\ninterlinking system of many muscles\ninvolving complex motor programmes.\nTo explain what it is, how it works, and\nhow to train it would be digressing\nfrom the current topic of discussion so\nI suggest you come and speak to one\nof the Energia instructors for more\ninformation.\nHowthen,dowetraintheabdominals\nfor stability and support of the spine\nand pelvis, or in the transfer of force\nthrough the body? Sadly crunches, oblique crunches, leg raises etc aren\u2019t the\nanswer. The rectus abdominis (the \u201c6\npack\u201d) is designed to work as a major\nstabiliser of the spine, predominantly\nin full spinal extension. It is not designed to be crunched, crunched, then\ncrunched some more. In fact the main\nresult of crunching away is to increase\nthe muscle\u2019s resting tone causing a\nshortness of the muscle which leads to\nimbalances in the body which in turn\nwill lead to numerous injuries, aches\nand pains, predominantly of the lower\nback and neck region.\nHave a good look at most footballers\n(sorry to pick on you footballers out\nthere but you tend to do a vast amount\nof crunches in your training!) from the\nside and you will invariably see a depressed rib cage and a forward head\nposture (your ears by the way should\nbe in line with your shoulders not in\nfront of them!). Oblique crunches,\nbicycle crunches and exercises along\nthose lines will also cause the same\nproblems.\nYou\u2019ll have to come and find our\npage again next week to learn how you\nshould train your abdominal muscles.\nWeek 3 and a lot more results are in.\nThe ranking of the teams is based on\nthe Felix Index (FI), which is calculated\nas follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) \u2013 (L*3).\nThe netball girls are the new leaders of\nthe league after a string of amazing re-sults, whilst the Lacrosse team are sadly bottom.

Good early pressure\npaid off with a supremely taken goal by\nJumanji within the first 2mins. RUM\u2019s\nmanaged to fight their way into the\ngame with some gutsy play in a match\nthat was becoming increasingly physi-cal. IC however proved themselves the\nstronger team with some more classic\nmanoeuvres and a touch a good for-tune. By half time the lead had been\nstretched to 4-0.\nThe second half began at the same\nfurious pace as the first had ended.\nExcellent effort and commitment from\nthe midfield trio of Krusty, Princess and\nPaedo all but neutralised RUM\u2019s two\nmost threatening players. Any attacks\nOwen Connick\nwhich did manage to sneak through\nwere cleaned up and thrown out by the\nsolid back four of Mountie, Shipman,\nDate Rape and Foetus, while Plug had\na fairly quiet game in goal. As legs began to tire, IC introduced some fresh\nlegs in the form of Nugget Porn and\nAss Rape who both showed great skill.\nMore good work from the forwards\nsaw Sid grab a couple and Jumanji getting a double hattrick. Stumpy failed to\nmake the score sheet but was central to\nevery attack and made a major contribution to the game.\nIC ended the game tired and showing\nsigns of the fray but proud and pleased\nto register their first win of the season.\nHockey men\u2019s 1st\ncontain Rums\nHockey\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XI 8\nRUMs Men\u2019s 1st XI 1\nMan of the hour Jumanji\nStudents from both Imperial College Union Hockey Club and Imperial\nMedics Hockey Club gathered at their\nbrand new hockey pitch on Friday 5\nOctober as part of its official opening\nby England Hockey International, Jennie Bimson.\nThe event was also attended by\nProfessor Rees Rawlings and his wife,\nAnne. Professor Rawlings, who recently retired from his position as Pro\nRector for Educational Quality, has\nbeen heavily involved in the College\u2019s\nsporting matters for a number of years\nand was delighted to see the new pitch\nin place.\nThe surface is the first of its kind to\nbe installed anywhere in the UK. The\nTiger Turf WETT system is designed\nto offer hockey players the perfect surface to perform their skills. The dense\nfibres, with inbuilt \u2018wet feel\u2019, provides\na durable playing surface, which can\nbe used in wet or dry conditions. This\nsurface, the most advanced in world\nhockey, meets the International Hockey Federation\u2019s highest test standards\nand can also be used for other sports\nincluding football and tennis.\nThe event kicked off at midday with\nJennie Bimson, who has 165 caps for\nEngland under her belt, cutting the\nribbon and officially opening the pitch.\nJennie kindly donated a signed shirt\nfrom the England Women\u2019s Hockey\nSquad and took a 45 minute training session with about 20 Imperial\nstudents.\nThe students were really put through\ntheir paces during the session and\nlearnt a few new tricks from their experienced coach. Even Union President,\nStephen Brown, could not resist taking\npart. Stephen, a footballer for the College whilst studying, was dressed in the\nnecessary attire and put in goal for the\nsession managing to please the crowd\nwith some amazing saves.\nProfessor Rawlings said a few words\nover lunch in the ground\u2019s pavilion,\ncommenting on the \u201csuperb quality\u201d\nof the new pitch and also advising students to make the most of their time\nat university by taking part in as much\nsport as possible.\nNeil Mosley, Head of Sport Imperial, added: \u201cWe are delighted with our\nnew pitch. The quality of the advanced\npitch system demonstrates our commitment to developing our facilities\nfor the benefit of our students and the\nlocal community, as well as strengthening our partnership with QPR FC.\nNow that the academic year has begun,\nwe will be able to see this new pitch being used to its full potential by Imperial\nhockey players.\u201d\nLeena Bharadia\nSport Imperial\nHockey get state of the art pitch\nEngland hockey international and Imperial students launch a\nnew hockey pitch at Harlington Sports Ground\nNetball on a winning streak\nWe got our season off to a start with\na trip to Holland Park on the 17/10/07\nfor our first BUSA game. After discussion between us, Holland Park and IC\ntennis (who still haven\u2019t come to claim\nthe drinks we said we would buy them\nevery Wednesday in the union!), we\nfinally managed to get on the court.\nMissing our GS we dragged in Rachel\nDilley to play (usually a GD) and by the\nend of the first half it was obvious the\ngame was in the bag! With attack, Jess\nMarley and Jen Lang working the ball\naround the goal third and Sara Willis\nand Rachel never missing a shot, it was\n38-12 to us by the end of the first half.\nWe stepped up the game in the second\nhalf with defence Candy Fisher, Alex\nGodlee and Kate Chapman owning\ntheir goal third and only letting them\nscore 7 goals! We ended our first match\n63-19. Man of the Match was Sara Willis, IC player of the match was Jen\nLand and Candy Fisher got Twat of the\nmatch for sitting in bird poo and getting it absolutely everywhere.\nOur second game was a ULU match\nagainst St Georges Medics 2nd team in\nEthos. Again we got off to a good start\nand at the end of the first half it was\n22-4 to IC. Despite us all sweating like\na nun\u2019s minge in a whore house (Ethos\nneeds air con!) and sliding around on\nthe freshly polished floor we had another convincing win 48-7. Man of the\nMatch was Sara Willis, IC player of the\nmatch was Alex Godlee and Twat of\nthe match went to Jess Marley for the\nmost shocking pass in the history of\nNetball\nImperial 1sts 63\nGreenwhich 1st 19\nNetball\nImperial 1sts 48\nSt. George\u2019s 1st 7\nNetball\nRoyal Vets 1st 24\nImperials 1sts 54\nKate Chapman\nAll England Netball.\nThen it was off to the country to play\nRoyal Vets 1st who had been relegated\nfrom the league above. We \u2018thought\u2019\nthey were going to be good going on\nprevious encounters (losing heavily)\nwith this \u2018team of giants\u2019. We fought\nhard and were up at the end of the first\nhalf despite a couple of bloody injuries\n(Candy gauging her knee whilst tying\nher shoe laces). We kept fighting and\nthe end score was 54-24 to us, another\namazing score from the girls in blue!\nMan of the Match once again was\ngiven to Sara Willis, IC player of the\nmatch was Lauren Anderson-Dring for\nher first game in IC colours and once\nagain Twat of the match went to Candy\nFisher for her unfortunate incident and\nbrilliant First Aid skills. I\u2019d like to say\nthanks to all the team for their continued commitment and determination\non court.\nLets keep it up girls!!!\nICU and Medic hockey players pose for a photo with Jennie Bimson Union President Steve Brown with Jennie Bimson (ain\u2019t she small)\nImperial going for the net\n\n"

Another remarkable performance was from the Table Tennis\nteam who destroyed Kings College\n16-1! Mens Football also made a solid\nstart to the season, the 1s starting their\nBUSA campaign with a 2-0 victory\nagainst Westminster last week.\nI\u2019m writing this on Tuesday so have\nno idea what the big results section\nover there looks like, so hopefully we\u2019ll\nhave had plenty of great results on\nWednesday to continue the very good\nstart to the season across the board!\nA quick report to you all now on the\nACC bar night that we held on the\nsecond Wednesday of term; we tried\nsomething different this time, and due\nto a massive turnout, a new record in\nfact, you may have felt like you didn\u2019t\nget enough red beer for your mon-ey?! Well you\u2019re probably right as the\nevening actually turned a profit, against\nour plans to break even, or even make a\nsmall loss. With the profit we did make\nwe\u2019re going to try and ensure that the\nnext bar night to be held near to the\nend of term is another record breaker,\nand that you can get your hands on\nmore drink than you can shake a hockey stick at. Any suggestions about how\nwe can do this should go to your club\ncaptains so they can be discussed at\nthe next ACC meeting.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and thinking\n\u2018what about my club\u2019s excellent result\u2019\nthen you need to write a match report\nto be put into Felix, or let me know\nabout it so I can briefly mention it here.\nRemember, this is your newspaper, and\nthat means you need to contribute,\neither through my little section, or by\nwriting a match report in yourselves.\nFor members of all ACC Clubs, and\nanyone else who isn\u2019t a member yet,\nbut wants to be, my email is lt04@ic.ac.\nuk and you can email me at any time to\nfind out about playing sport here at IC,\nI can put you in contact with the right\npeople for your chosen sport.\nHopefully I\u2019ll have got the hang of\nthis by next week and actually have\nsomething to write about, so for now,\nenjoy your sport, and remember, I can\u2019t\nshout about your achievements unless\nyou tell me about it!\nLuke Taylor\nA.C.C.

The girls\nmanaged to score 63 points in a 60\nminute game, that\u2019s just over a score\na minute (or for the keen eyed ones\nout there 1.05 points per minute).\nWell done girls, let\u2019s hope the current run continues.\nAlissa Ayling\nSports Partnership\nThe Sports Partnership is an alliance\nbetween Sport Imperial and Imperial\nCollege Union to oversee the development of student sport at Imperial.\nThe aims of the Partnership are to\npromote and enhance the performance and participation in student sport\nacross the College in a safe environment through professionalism, relevant administrative support systems\nand advice.\nThis alliance between Sport Imperial and the Union provides the opportunity for students to benefit from\nthe many opportunities that are available to them such as coaching, sports\ndevelopment, sports kit, club sponsorship and facility usage, as well as a\ndedicated student sport administrative\npresence based at the Union through\nthe Sports Partnership Administrator.\nThe Partnership seeks to encourage\nand support students to participate in\norganised sports through leagues and\nladders, i.e. 5-a-side football leagues\nand squash ladders;

Should you eat before you train?\nWell it\u2019s all about getting the balance\nright and finding out what works best\nfor you.\nIt\u2019s not advisable to eat too much prior to exercise as this can make you feel\ntired or, worse still, cause upset stomach and cramping. However, not eating\nat all prior to training can also have a\nnegative effect. Low blood sugar levels\ncan cause us to feel weak, tired or faint.\nIt can also affect our mental ability.\nWhat should we eat then prior to\ntraining?

Or\nnot.\nThe thing is, Hallowe\u2019en issues are\njust way too ubiquitous at this time of\nthe year. The Internet is saturated with\nrecommendations of spooky, creepy\nand otherwise downright scary titles.\nYou know \u2013 the usual suspects. Expect\nstuff like Resident Evil 4, Doom 3, Fatal Frame II (known as Project Zero II\nhere), F.E.A.R., and Silent Hill 3 (I like\nit better than 4). Fresh blood into the\nlist will probably involve the atmospheric BioShock and action-centric\nClive Barker\u2019s Jericho.\nWhen considering such lists you\u2019ll\nnotice that the methods for expressing the horror factor vary about two\nmain points. Western-style titles tend\nto offer palpable atmospheres within new environments and plenty of\nshock moments whereas games from\nthe East offer a false sense of security by placing the player in surroundings that are meant to be familiar and\nsecular but then contort everything\nholy into something grotesque. Such\nhas been the case for quite some time\nnow, but recent titles have broken the\nmould now and then. Resident Evil 4\nhas an interesting formula. It\u2019s not an\nexplicitly scary game, but the way it\u2019s\nbeen designed will make you palpitate\nthroughout your play time. This is because the enemies you face present a\ngenuine threat to your survival due to\nbrilliantly programmed A.I.\nOf course, not all freaky moments\nemanate from games with a horror\nstamp pasted on. One of the creepiest\nmoments I\u2019ve ever experienced comes\nfrom the wonderfully eclectic Katamari Damacy. An early tutorial sees you\nlearning the nuances of rolling the\ntitular katamari. During this exer-cise, you have the opportunity to pan\nthe camera around to scope out your\nsurroundings. If you ever make the\nmistake of looking upwards, you will\nscream out in shock. A humongous,\nmoustached, purple face happens to be\nstaring down at you with his eyes twinkling with a sense of voyeuristic and/\nor paedophilic pleasure. You decide.\nThis stranger happens to be the King\nof All Cosmos whose role in the game,\nbesides setting you missions, is to\nspurt out an incessant barrage of inanities that will either make you laugh... or\nshudder. Creeeeeepy.\nOoh, look at the time... I need to\nwrap up now. This week\u2019s focus lands\non a collection of some of the most enticing Flash-based sports games online\nwhereas on the other end of the spread,\nI discuss the status quo of the sports\ngenre in videogames and consider the\nreasons as to why they\u2019re a breed that\nwill never die out.\nBy the way, if you\u2019re still looking for\nyour Hallowe\u2019en issue, you might want\nto read this section one more time.\nCheeky, I know.\nThis\nWeek\nStick Sports \u2013 take a bough\nStick Cricket Stick Football\nArmchair Athletes Stick Baseball\nAzfarul Islam discovers that being malnourished doesn\u2019t make you a lesser player\nA\nn addicting compilation\nof Flash-based sports\ntitles, Stick Sports is defined by its caricaturised\ngraphics and arcade-like gameplay. There are a surprising\nnumber of options and the communal\naspects are quite brilliant. Once regis-tered, you\u2019re able to log your statistics\nand watch yourself traverse worldwide\ntables. It\u2019s easily one of the true successors to cabinet gaming.\nStick Cricket\nThe problem with cricket games is that\nthey often fail to capture the delicate\nnuances that govern the ebb and flow\nof real matches. In the case of the emaciated edition, it\u2019s a godsend. I mean,\neveryone really just wants to bat in\ncricket; bowling is so tedious. Stripping\naway complex shot intricacies, Stick\nCricket drops you down to the very basics of batting: hitting the ball in whatever direction you fancy. However, it\u2019s\nupto the player to be observant and\npick out the pitch, swing and bounce\nof the ball. Normally, you\u2019ll get away\nwith standard cuts, drives and pull-shots when facing pure pacers. They\nbowl linearly and any tap can send the\nball flying. The next step after that are\nthe swing bowlers; unlike pacers their\npitches will change direction mid-flight, requiring you to make some late\nshots. Pushing this further is the bane\nof all amateur batsmen: the spinners.\nThey require constant attention and\npretty good reflexes to keep up with.\nThere are other permutations of bowling tactics as well, so the game doesn\u2019t\nlack depth. Fortunately, each bowler is\npreceded by a card displaying his name\nand attack style so that you are offered\nsome semblance of preparation.\nThe All Star Slog mode is basically a\nby-the-overs cricket match. T2 Super\n8 is a lot more exciting in that you play\na series of matches in 2-over bursts\nwith the final goal being the coveted\nvictor of the \u2018Stick Cricket World Cup\u2019.\nThe Challenge mode is my personal\nfavourite though. Here, you\u2019ll choose\na club team and then attempt to score\nas many runs as possible from ten de-liveries. Each boundary gives you an\nextra ball so theoretically you can keep\ngoing on. Getting out, however, costs a\nhefty five points. There\u2019s a Head2Head\nstanding table that\u2019s updated to reflect\nthe performance of the virtual teams.\nIt\u2019s probably the only time I\u2019ll ever see\nmy own team (Bangladesh) in the top\nthree. Minnow? Stick Cricket begs to\ndiffer in its own zany way.\nwww.stickcricket.com\nStick Baseball\nAh, baseball. Assumedly created when\noverzealous Americans couldn\u2019t figure\nout the intricacies of cricket. The Stick\nedition of this Yankee pastime does\naway with the rigours and team stratagems in lieu of the \u201cSmack That\u201d tactics\nlaid down by Dr Akon in collaboration\nwith Prof Eminem of Rhythmic Ebonics fame. This game is limited to the\nfour direction keys but don\u2019t let that\nfool you. In true arcade fashion, these\nsimple controls take time to master, requiring vision, timing and occasionally,\na bit of luck. There\u2019s a guiding box that\nplayers will use to gauge the apparent\ndirection of pitched deliveries. Once\nyou\u2019ve decided your swing, tap the\nappropriate key at the right moment.\nInitially, you\u2019ll be fooled easily because\nthe pitches often don\u2019t go where you\nexpect them to, but that\u2019s where the\nchallenge comes into play. With time,\nyou\u2019ll refine your technique, pick out\nthe swing and smack that ball into the\ncrowds.\nThe game offers quite a few modes.\nThere\u2019s the standard training mode\nthat gets you used to the controls in the\nguise of playing the role of rookie looking to get into a real team. The All Star\nSlug is a standard match whereas the\nHome Run Derby is a challenge wherein you attempt you hit the highest\nnumber of home-runs. The number hit\nalongside the longest streak is recorded\nso that you may attempt to break into\nthe Hall of Fame. The most involving\nmode, however, is World Domination.\nIt\u2019s a ladder-style tournament where\nyou start by playing the team at the\nbottom of the rankings and then build\nyour way up to the very top. Passwords\nare offered after every match so that\nyou can continue your blitzkrieg.\nStick Football\nIf you\u2019re going to have a sports compilation it\u2019s a mortal sin to forego the\ngreatest game of them all: football.\nWii Sports\u2019 only failing is Stick Sports\u2019\ntriumph. Channelling the simple\ntwo-button energy of ancient arcade\nfootball, Stick Football is quite a chal-lenging, peppy title. You\u2019re limited to\neight-directional motion, a shoot and a\npass/tackle button but that\u2019s perfectly\nfine, since you really need no more\nthan that to truly enjoy the game (\u2026\nand that was the sound of all the PES\nplayers just exploding right about\nnow). The gameplay in general is fast-paced and frenetic as each team rushes\nto score before the whistle is blown.\nIn an inspired touch that evaded classic football games, you\u2019re able to apply\ncurl or height to your shots by holding the corresponding direction after\nbooting the ball. Stick Football can be a\nbit of a challenge to play if you\u2019re used\nto modern football games, but it\u2019s still\ngood fun. Once you start scoring goals,\nit\u2019s plain awesome.\nThe best aspect of this game is the\npersistent league table that\u2019s updated\nevery match day. When playing in the\nPremier League mode, you can directly\naffect the standings of your sports warriors by winning, losing or drawing. In\nthe ubiquitous All Stars mode, you\ntake on a star-studded team with any\nother group of your choice. Since the\ngame was intended to be run alongside the 2006 FIFA World Cup, there\u2019s\nan eponymous mode where you take\non national teams to win gold. For the\nEU-oriented, there\u2019s the Champions\nLeague. Unfortunately, other national\nleagues are absent.\nwww.stickfootball.com\nwww.stickbaseball.com\n\n"

I realise\nthat the name is a bit mislead-ing, and the fact that the only\npieces I\u2019ve had in Felix thus far\nhave involved generally laying\ninto people, and that in this particular issue of Felix I refer to women as a\nhorde of malevolent bitches. However,\nin general, when I\u2019m just your com-mon-or-garden student taking notes in\nGeneric Module III, I\u2019m cheery.\nI write angry things. I realise this. As I\nmentioned, this week I am angry about\nwomen. But I write angrily about stuff\nall the time. I complained to the BBC\nwhen they allowed John Humphries to\nretire from The Today Programme, so\nany ladies offended by this issue\u2019s column should probably take comments\nwith a pinch of salt, or at least accept\nthat they\u2019re a horrendous gender full of\nspite and hypocrisy. Whichever.\nAnyway, however tongue-in-cheek\nyou believe me to be, I\u2019m fairly sure\nthat I wink at and nudge you more than\nRoy and Mary, the authors of That\nBitch, do in their book.\nSorry, \u2018book\u2019.\nThe Felix Arts team thought I might\nlike to look at this \u2018book\u2019, which they\ninitially described to me as \u201clike your\ncolumn, during a hissy fit\u201d, and tell you\nall whether you should rush out and\nbuy it.\nShort answer for those of you who\naren\u2019t interested in seven hundred\nwords of me tearing into the literary excrement of two retards \u2013 good\nChrist no, you most definitely should\nnot buy this \u2018book\u2019.\nIf you think you might actually like\nto read this pile of tripe, it would probably be better for everyone if you just\ngave me the ridiculous twelve pounds\nninety-five that it costs and just let me\nflash pictures of Hitler and Marilyn\nMonroe at you for five hours, whilst\nasking you to recount every break-up\nwith every girlfriend you\u2019ve ever had\nand spitting at you.\nThe \u2018book\u2019 is about That Bitch which,\napparently, everyone has in their lives,\nand why they\u2019re conspiring against\nyou to steal your genitals and usurp\noil reserves in Canada, or something.\nIf you\u2019re a man, presumably you\u2019re\nsupposed to think of the last girl who\ndumped you, and instead of putting\nit down to you being a complete jerk\nwhen she introduced you to her par-ents, you instead convince yourself that\nshe was really just buttering you up for\na divorce seven years from now.\nBut ladies, don\u2019t feel left out! The\nbook helpfully states that, \u201creasonable\nwomen do not have a problem with\nour book because they know it is NOT\nabout them.\u201d So that means you either\nagree with the suggestions made in this\nbook, or are That Bitch yourself. Interested now? Of course you are.\nAccording to Google Images, this is a photo of some bitches. Just looks like an ugly dude and the cast of a very cheap porno to me, though\nLet\u2019s backtrack a little. The authors,\nRoy Sheppard and Mary Cleary, have\na mixed relavancy to the topic. Roy is\nan ex-journalist for the Beeb and the\nwriter of vague pseudo-business books\nwith titles such as \u201cNetwork To Win\u201d\nand similar-sounding rubbish. Mary\u2019s\na nurse-turned-male-saviour after\nseeing so many examples of domestic\nabuse against men, spurring her to set\nup Amen, a support group.\nA high-flying journalist with a taste\nfor hyperbole and a nurse who\u2019s seen a\nlot of very similar cases, leading her to\nassume that it\u2019s a worldwide epidemic.\nIt\u2019s already shaping up to be a well-rounded and reasonable book, right? It\ngets better.\nFor some reason, they\u2019re absolutely\nfoaming at the mouth about women\nwho appear to manipulate others for\npersonal gain. Fanatically so.\nIt\u2019s quite disturbing at times, as they\nraise dozens of suggestions that would\nfill entire sociology courses at some\nUniversities, positing all manner of\ngems ranging from their list of tell-tale\nsigns you may have been a victim (Did\nyou ever break up with someone and\nthen hate them a bit? They\u2019re probably\nmanipulative. That\u2019s science, folks)\nto suggestions of how to go about divorcing one (\u201cIf she ever asks whether\nyou\u2019re planning a divorce, don\u2019t tell\nher. Never be seen to leave your chil-dren. Don\u2019t keep money at home, she\nmay find it and keep it.\u201d) I only wish I\ncould make up such brilliant stuff for\nthe Comment section.\nAnd it just goes on, really. I thought\nthe Internet was supposed to soak up\nbile like this into weblogs that no-one\nread, but somehow it\u2019s got into paper\nform and even managed to make Loaded magazine \u2013 who bizarrely termed\nRoy Sheppard \u201cthe world\u2019s best agony\nuncle\u201d. There\u2019s a chapter where they\nspeak in funny German accents and\ngrow beards to discuss \u201cthe psychology\u201d of being a bitch, which involves lots\nof good words that no-one really understands but sound good like \u201csociopath\u201d and \u201cmisanthrope\u201d. Then there\u2019s\na chapter about how children are used\nas \u201cWeapons of Male Destruction\u201d, and\nit sort of just goes on and on and eventually they stop writing and just appear\nto copy-paste in chunks of a thirteen\nyear-old\u2019s diary, discussing about how\ntough life is, how girls are mean and\nneed to be defended against, and how\nthey wish everyone could be happy.\nBut the worst part \u2013 and I mean,\naboveandbeyondthebullcrappsychol-ogy and generalisations that would look\nout of place in Patrick Kielty\u2019s stand-up show \u2013 is by far the fact that it toys\nwith the reader to a far greater extent\nthan the bitches it claims to describe.\nThe way it ekes your greatest fears and\nparanoias, plays on them, fuels them\nand eventually perhaps even tricks\nyou into acting upon them, is beyond\ndespicable. There are horrible women\nout there, without a doubt. But there\nare also a lot of fine women, in healthy\nrelationships with insecure or uneasy\nmen. And these men are going to read\na book like this and be very quickly\npushed into doing something utterly\nretarded and totally irreversible.\nWhen I write a column and say nasty\nthings about people, I expect you to\njust swear at the paper, write an angry\nemail or at the very least just turn the\npage and move on. I\u2019m not honestly\nexpecting you to start following my\nbitter, curse-stained trail up the slopes\nof Mount Middle-Age. But this kind of\nbook goes the wrong side of that. It\u2019s\nplaying a tune that rings quite sympathetically in a lot of ears, but it\u2019s leading\nyou up a path you can\u2019t easily backtrack\ndown.\nWhen I first read the press release for\nThat Bitch, I thought it was a fiction\nbook, or one of those joke things you\nbuy for those friends who you like, but\ndon\u2019t know well enough to get them\nanything meaningful at Christmas.\nWhen I received a straight-faced, mid-dle-finger-waving piece of misgynistic\nclaptrap, I realised that the reason I\nwas given this to review wasn\u2019t because\nit would be amusing to see an angry\nperson be angry about a silly book. It\u2019s\nbecause the only way you can defuse\nsomething as dangerous and horrific\nas this is to put it on the ground and\nkick it until it\u2019s dead.\nThat Bitch is appalling. If anyone\u2019s\nunfortunate enough to find it when it\ngets BookCrossed, please just do everyone a favour and throw it away. Men\nclaim to be martyrs enough as it is,\nwithout convincing them that \u201cwomen\nwith no conscience prey on men with\ntoo much.\u201d\nNo shit. I hear Z-list journalists do a\nsimilar thing with people that have too\nmany worries.\nIf you\u2019d still like to get your hands\non a copy, despite The Angry\nGeek\u2019s feelings, find us on www.\nbookcrossing.com under the\nfelixarts username to see when\nwe\u2019ll release our copy, or pop into\nyour local high street bookstore\nor www.thatbitch.com \u2013 That\nBitch is \u00a312.95 and is available\nnow\n\u201cFelix Arts\nthought I might\nlike to look at\nthis book and tell\nyou whether you\nshould buy it.\nShort answer \u2013\ngood Christ no\u201d\n\n"

Like the old death-and-taxes routine goes, every recent\nyear has enjoyed / suffered (take your\npick) a slew of sports titles.\nDespite the creep of increasing ennui and ever diminishing returns, the\nsheer organic, ephemeral nature of the\nsports game just begs for inexplicable\nlevels of popularity and more impor-tantly: playability.\nThe most salient issue involves player congregation and social aspects.\nThese games aren\u2019t usually meant to\nbe played on your lonesome.

It\u2019s\na battle of wits, will and skills really as\nyou use a m\u00e9lange of tactics to outdo\nyour peer(s). You can take him or her\non with pure gameplay or perhaps\nspice things up with a few underhand\ntricks. Changing the channel before a\nkey moment? Pausing to fiddle with\nyour line-up? Or perhaps even an ordinary foul \u2013 be it a shove, push or a\nbouncer straight at the chin. The possibilities are endless. Games that breed\nnatural showboating such as skate- and\nsnow-boarding are great for challenges\nof bravado. It can lead to some spectacular stuff and it\u2019s not hard to involve\neven the non-gamers out there.\nThe ease of controls and general parity is another magnanimous feature\non offer. This allows more than the\noft shallow cesspool of hardcore gamers to get drawn in, and rather deep\nat that. The embarrassing geek factor\nassociated with videogames in general\nis usually exempt on most occasions.\nDespite being a game, this is still based\non an actual sport and with advances,\nhowever little they may seem, the difference between the virtual and the real\nstarts to blur. Even before the advent\nof the Wii, games like Tiger Wood\u2019s\nGolf and Fight Night (boxing) offered\nintuitive control systems that tried offer as organic experiences as possible\nso that you\u2019re in full control of every\nputt, sidestep and haymaker. Playing\na round of football, cricket or basketball and passing around the controllers\noffers a pretty social outlook in that it\ncombines two fervent topics of interests into a tasty package.\nWith time, these little games have\nalso evolved into something a whole\nlot more omnipresent. They are representative of many memetic values\nendemic to our time. From being the\nfocus of cash-incentive tournaments\nto serving as random predictors, these\ngames are so much more; fantasy online leagues included. They\u2019re key\nproponents of merchandising as well,\nparticularly due to the inextricable\nlinkage of largely lucrative franchises.\nEA knew what it was doing when it\nspent millions to attain exclusivity of\nthe NFL banner. Whenever a watershed tournament is underway, you can\nbe sure that a cavalcade of sports titles\nwill follow.\nThis near-seamless integration of\nsport and game has lead to intriguing outcomes. The first and foremost\nwould be the promulgation of the\nsports themselves, and with time, the\nstars of the shows: the players. There\nwere times, quite a few years ago,\nwhen I wondered as to how many of\nmy friends were keeping so up-to-date\nwith football players despite the limited TV showings and lack of Internet prevalence in Bangladesh. Upon\ninvestigation, one answer rose above\nthe others: FIFA, EA\u2019s footballing be-hemoth. If I weren\u2019t mistaken later on,\nnot only were these games telling fans\nabout the players, but they were teaching something far greater. People were\nactually learning about the sports and\nexperimenting. While ubiquitous activities like football have persevered\nfor ages, things like skateboarding have\nyet to break into the casual crowd.\nYet here we have people understanding the fine nuances of a manual trick\nfrom the comfort of their armchair. A\nfew bumps and bruises may follow the\nnext week, but someone will have attempted to break new ground.\nSpeaking of bumps, the Wii melds\nphysicality into the noble art of armchair athleticism. When you get involved in a normal sports game, your\nbody language expresses such. A goal\nin Pro Evo 6 is juxtaposed with a jump\nfor joy whereas smacking a full-on ace\nin Top Spin leads you to swinging your\ncontroller just a bit to appreciate the\nharmony of such motion. Now what\nif that same body language, in sync\nwith adrenaline-charged emotions,\nactually translated into gameplay? If a\nwild swing of your right hand claims\nyou a 40-Love victory\u2026 if a violent jab\nknocks out your relentlessly dodging\nopponent\u2026 that\u2019s entertainment at a\nwhole new level. The gap between the\nplayer and the game grows ever narrower since you realise that you have\nmore control; there\u2019s more of you in\nthe game.\nSo all this excitement begs the ques-tion: SSX 3 or real-life snowboarding?\nI\u2019m more than inclined to try the latter\nany day now... once I\u2019ve mastered the\ngame iteration.\n\n"

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport\nEngland\u2019s Rugby World Cup 2007\nSeptember the 8th started promisingly enough. Dave and I had driven\n2 hours east of Calais to Lens for England\u2019s opening match of their world\ncup campaign against the USA. With\nthe sun blazing overhead England\nkicked off the defence of the William\nWebb Ellis trophy to the enthusiastic roar of Swing Low Sweet Chariot.\nHow quickly the mood changed, after\n80 minutes of rugby England had been\nwritten off, despite that fact that they\nhad won. The match against South Africa only seemed to confirm our deepest fears, England may not even escape\nthe group\u2026..\nFast forward one week and again\nDave and I were in Lens, this time\nfor the South Africa vs Tonga match.\nOnce again the sun was shining, but\nthis time we were in for a real treat.\nThe South Pacific Islanders were magnificent providing big hits and fantastic breaks, it seemed that South Africa\nwere about to be on the receiving end\nof one of rugby\u2019s biggest upsets. The\nbig guns were brought on to steady the\nSpringbok ship, and that they did. But\nit could have been so different if the\nball had bounced the other way in the\nfinal play of the match. We had been\nprivy to one of the matches of the tournament with an atmosphere the like of\nwhich I hadn\u2019t seen before.\nWe rushed quickly to the nearest bar\nto catch the England Samoa match,\nknowing that victory was needed to\nset up the group decider with Tonga.\nDespite some hairy moments England\npulled through, and we set off into\nLens city centre with some South African fans for a night of drinking and\ndebauchery.\nEngland beat Tonga the following\nweek setting up a quarter final with\nAustralia, but I had already abandoned\nhope of seeing them in the final, the\ngeneral consensus being that France or\nNew Zealand would meet South Africa\nin the Stade de France on the 20th of\nOctober.\nThen the impossible happened,\ninspired by the monstrous Andrew\nSheridan the England scrimmaged,\nmauled and rucked the Wallabies into\nthe ground, setting up an unlikely semi\nfinal with France who had come from\nbehind to shock the All Blacks. Would\nwe see the white of England in the fi-nal? Of course we would, I was never in\ndoubt! Another bruising affair saw the\nEnglish chariot roll on after a narrow\nvictory against Les Bleus, thanks in\npart to the magnificent boot of Jonny.\nSo, early on the morning of the 20th\nof October, Dave and I once more\nmade our way to France. This time\nthe destination for us and thousands\nof other English supporters was Paris.\nThe atmosphere in the city was elec-tric, thousands of singing fans, the\nFrench, who had been amazing supporters throughout the whole tourna-ment, joining in. There was a real belief\nwe could do it.\nAnd we nearly did. If only that try\nhad been given, if only those kicks had\ngone over, if only. To be brutally honest the best team throughout the tournament won, and our boys had been\nmagnificent on their comeback from\nthe thrashing they received only one\nmonth earlier.\nAnd so to the after party, Dave and I\nheaded into the city centre to sample\nthe delights Paris had to offer. Surprisingly there was no mood of dejection\namongst the English fans, after all the\nboys had surpassed all expectation.\nAnd the cup was only on loan to the\nBoks, we\u2019ll get it back in four years.\nDaniel Lindsley\nMeanwhile in London...\nOver in the glorious country of France...\nDaniel Lindsley and David Griffiths having a bevvy in Paris\nTadpole realising that he\u2019s running out of beer A picture from Stad\u00e9 de France itself, the Rugby World Cup Final\nA picture from dB\u2019s itself, the Rugby World Cup Final\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nThere was no doubt that when the rugby club decided to host a special World\nCup Final event in dB\u2019s, that England\nwould not be in it, but yet there we all\nwere about to watch them play against\nSouth Africa. Clearly we were not the\nonly ones who couldn\u2019t believe it as\nthe Union decided to put on an extra\nscreen in the quad as well as the ones\nthat will be showing it in Da Vinci\u2019s.\nThe night was an undoubtable suc-cess, with all three venues being\npacked with eager fans cheering on\nthe England side, however the match\nitself didn\u2019t go our way. Footballers,\nhockey players, netballers, rugby fans\nand generally any fans that appreciated\nan English team being in the final of a\nworld cup could be seen throughout\nthe union rooms watching the final.\nCries of disagreement could be heard\nthroughout the country when the referee decided to not award the Cueto\ntry, a try that could have led to an even\nmore nail biting finish.\nHowever the best team of the tournament did win, like Dan mentions in\nhis article, and the English fans should\nbe proud of how their boys managed\nto pull it all together when it really\nmattered.\nSo despite the fact the England didn\u2019t\nwin the final, and on a quick side note\nHamilton also failed to win the F1\nchampionship, people were not dejected and the night carried on, with many\nstaying in the Union until closing. Of\ncourse the South Africans that turned\nup were doing their best to reminded\neveryone who won, but don\u2019t you wor-ry, we\u2019ll get it back!\n35\nfelix\nFriday 26 October 2007\n\n"

If you have ever kept\none as a pet or you are generally of the \u2018meat is murder\u2019 persuasion then read on at your own risk\nAhran Arnold\nTravel Editor\nThe country: Peru. The city: Lima. The\ncritter on the menu: \u2018Cavia Porcellus\u2019\notherwise known as the humble guinea\npig. It was nearing the end of my jaunt\nin South America when it dawned on\nmy fellow traveller, Strachan, that there\nwas one thing missing from our Peruvian experience. We\u2019d tried some of the\npopular dishes such as \u2018Ceviche,\u2019 which\nis essentially raw seafood marinated\nwith chilli and lime served up with\nsome potato and potato-like alterna-tives. There was one dish, though, that\nhad eluded us: \u2018Cuy,\u2019 the Peruvian name\nfor Guinea Pig.\nWe donned our sleuth-ing outfits (remarkably similar to our\nbackpacker outfits) ready to do some\nserious detective work to find out\nwhere we could eat some Cuy, which\nis not actually found abundantly in\ncoastal Lima. It is better represented in\nCuzco and other cities and towns more\ninland. After about an hour of fruitless\nsearch we caved and consulted the Bible (otherwise known as Lonely Planet), which directed us straight towards\na market in the historic centre.\nUnderstandable, really; relying on\nthe traveller\u2019s bible since I speak very\nlittle Spanish so asking people would\nnot have helped massively. In fact, I\u2019ll\ntell you, in Spanish, exactly how much\nSpanish I can speak: \u2018un poquito.\u2019 It\nsupposedly means \u2018a little\u2019 or \u2018very little.\u2019 That\u2019s all well and good, but if you\nask any traveller in Spanish speaking\ncountries (I\u2019m currently trying to coin\nthe term \u2018Spancophone\u2019) if they speak\nSpanish they will, 100% of the time,\nreply \u2018un poquito.\u2019 I heard it from people who had been travelling in South\nAmerica for a year, having studied\nSpanish in school for years and at uni-versity, and I also heard it from people\nwhose Spanish vocabulary consisted of\nthe words \u2018un poquito.\u2019 After a while I\nstopped asking. Rant over.\nWe approached our task with some\nhesitation. The reviews we had heard\nfrom other people who had tried Cuy\nwere not, on the whole, positive. One\nthat sticks out in my mind is \u201cImagine\nreally fatty, raw bacon with tiny, irritating bones.\u201d I can just see that description appearing on a menu at the Ivy.\nWe weren\u2019t deterred, though, as no\ntrip to Peru is complete with out trying Guinea Pig; it\u2019s actually considered\nquite the delicacy.\nStrachan, whose \u2018un poquito\u2019 of\nSpanish was considerably greater than\nmy own, asked around the restaurant\narea if any of the chefs served up Cuy.\nThe answer was a resounding no. The\nfinal \u2018no\u2019 we received was accompanied\nby squeaking and the tiny pitter-patter\nof footsteps. No, it wasn\u2019t bring-your-toddlers-to-work day at the market nor\nhad Strachan fell into one of his \u2018turns.\u2019\nWe had, in fact, stumbled across a vendor of live guinea pigs. Lady Luck truly\nsmiled on us that day. I turned to Strachan and waited, expectantly, for the\nsame idea to appear in his head. This\ntook a few minutes, he can be quite\nslow.\nWhat followed was surreal for a\nnumber of reasons. First of all once the\nsombre woman who sold the guinea\npig to us agreed a reasonable price she\nsnapped open her cage and grabbed a,\nsupposedly, tasty looking guinea pig\nby the scruff of the neck. The podgy\nbrown-and-white creature started\nsquealing its head off almost as if it was\naware of the grizzly fate that awaited it.\nShe then, suddenly, took off towards\na deserted area of the market, underground and beckoned us to follow. Her\nface was just as impassive as before but\nthe spring in her step told us that she\nlived for this moment.\nShe handed the critter over to someone else who had the grim task of killing and de-furring the poor little guy.\nThe actual moment of death was the\nbiggest anti-climax of all. She causally\nstrolled through the kitchen holding\nthe squirming, squealing guinea pig\nby its hind legs and, with a flick of the\nwrist, she unceremoniously banged the\nstruggling animal\u2019s head against a work\nOur friendly guinea pig vendor\nCould you bring yourself to eat this little fella?\nGuinea pig with all the trimmings. Just like momma used to make..\nsurface. Needless to say, the guinea\npig stopped wriggling instantly. So the\ndeed was done and unaffected butcher\nwent on to dunk the dead animal into\nboiling hot water and literally ripped\nout its fur. As a dutiful tourist I captured the whole thing on camera.\nWe then brought the corpse to one\nof the aforementioned chefs who was\nmore than happy to fry up the little fellowandminuteslaterwewere\u2018enjoying\u2019\nCuy with a side salad of lettuce and red\nonion. The meat was extremely fatty;\neven fattier than I had imagined when I\nheard the earlier review. It also almost\nadhered to clich\u00e9 in so much that it at\nleast resembled chicken in texture if\nnot taste. The bones were rather an-noying, and to be honest there was not\na huge amount of meat on the bones.\nThat said, it actually wasn\u2019t too bad.\nNot something I would order again but\nbeyond the taste there was something\ncomplete and organic about having\nwatched our meal transform from a\nliving, breathing, scurrying rodent to\nsomething that resembled a very small\nfried chicken. I was also given pause\nto think about the journey that all my\nother meaty meals underwent to arrive\nat my plate; only a slight pause, though,\nthat was interrupted by the mixed grill\nI had for dinner.\nNext week, Papua New Guinea and\nstepping up the \u2018strange meats\u2019 from\nrodent to human\u2026\n\n"

Write for us\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMichael Cook\nArts Editor\nS\no. Racism, then. I\u2019ve been trying to think of ways to subtly bring up the topic in this\nweek\u2019s editorial, but it turns\nout that shoehorning racism\ninto everyday conversation is a bit like\ntrying to crowbar a cow into another,\nslightly smaller cow. But enough about\nthis year\u2019s Turner Prize.\nHoho! That reminds me, I\u2019ve yet to\nput in this week\u2019s bar joke.\nYes, racism seems to be flavour of\nthe week from where I\u2019m standing. I\nwas saved the embarrassment of being unable to procure tickets to a sold\nout talk at the Science Museum this\nweek by having the speaker in question cancelled after a very public race\nrow. Whilst it means you\u2019ll never get to\nsee our article on James Watson, at the\nvery least you won\u2019t have to see his big-oted, wrinkly face anymore either.\nNaturally, we like free speech. In fact,\nbeing arts-lovers and therefore only a\nberet and a fake moustache away from\nsigning up to the socialist party, we like\nfree speech enough to say that James\nWatson, whilst being bigoted and wrin-kly, was allowed to say what he said.\nBut then there\u2019s Time Out, which\nthis week carries a headline about the\nLondon art scene being dominated by\nwhite people, and we begin to wonder\nwhether \u2018free speech\u2019 inevitably leads\nto broom-sweeping, carpet-lifting and\nlots of bad things collecting somewhere unseen.\nI like to think that creativity means\ncreativity, and that the \u2018arts scene\u2019which is a phrase I hope never to have\nto use again - is exempt from such worries because it has no targets to meet in\nterms of ethnic makeup. If there wasn\u2019t\na white face in the entire of the West\nEnd, or if they were entirely dominated\nby pasty-faced southerners such as\nmystel, it is there to be seen, absorbed\nand considered. You can\u2019t force equality onto something designed for open\nexpression, and nor should you attempt to.\nThat\u2019s easy to say, of course, because\nI\u2019m a pasty-faced southerner. Perhaps\nif the theatres were less white, I\u2019d be\ncomplaining about things that tend\nto make up Daily Mail headlines. But\nI like to think not, because I consider\nmyself part of a generation - and in-deed, part of a segment of a generation\n- that was freed from prejudice and the\nlike by major advances and events in\nthe world.\nThis week, I turn twenty. Next week,\nI start writing this year\u2019s novel as part\nof the National Novel Writing Month.\nCreativity to me is less hard-won than\nit was for those that saw the Cold War,\napartheid or the Second World War.\nBut it still means something to me, and\nit\u2019s still something that should remain\nfree, no matter how worried we may be\nby trends or opinions.\nOh, crap. Run out of space for a sum-mary. Uh... okay, this week - mysogyny\nand songs about racism.\nWait a second...\nHey there! I\u2019m a Philistine!\nJordi Brown finds romance, revenge and twists in this week\u2019s classic\nA\nbook that has had over\n30 screen adaptations\nmay sound like it means\nbusiness. Many of you\nwould have probably\neven watched one of them, or at least\nhave heard of the author, Alexandre\nDumas. So if it has had such an apparent success on the big screen then why\nread it? Well, I\u2019ll tell you...\nFor sure we all love going\ndown to the cinema with our oversized\nand overpriced popcorn and drink, you\nsit down and stare absentmindedly at\nthe seemingly everlasting adverts and\neventually watch the film you came\nto see. More often than not it will be\na mindless action thriller with way too\nmany explosions, guns, over the top\nclich\u00e9s and cheesy lines. Or perhaps\nit\u2019s a cheap chic flick with the same old\nstars playing the same old characters\nin increasingly ridiculous plots. But\nwait, how can I be saying all this, I love\nthose films, they bring laughter and\njoy to millions. I can do so because I\nhave read this book. It exceeds any expectations or generic misconceptions;\nit\u2019s truly a novel for anyone, jammed\npacked with adventure, mystery and\nrevenge for the guys, and glamour, extravagance and romance for the girls. A\nmasterpiece in literature and yet acces-sible, readable and flowing, the reader\ntravels with the hero and watches from\nthe sidelines as if there. It\u2019s hard to not\nget carried away here but so tempting,\nyou can only begin to imagine what it\u2019s\nlike, so gripping and awe-inspiring.\nSo what is it about? Our tale\nstarts with the young and na\u00efve Edmond Dant\u00e8s. He is a sailor arriving\nback in Marseilles and about to marry\nhis fianc\u00e9e, the beautiful Catalan Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. His trip aboard the Pharaon\nhas taken him to the exiled Emperor\nNapol\u00e9on Bonaparte who gives him a\nletter to deliver to France. The ship\u2019s\ncaptain dies on the return journey, and\non arrival Edmond is promoted to this\nposition. This angers his friend Danglars and sparks off a plan to ruin him.\nDanglars, having learned of the letter given to Dant\u00e8s, collaborates with\nFernand Mondego (another \u2018friend\u2019) in\nwriting a letter to the crown prosecu-tor, Villefort, in which it incriminates\nhim as a Bonapartist. Upon Dant\u00e8s\u2019\nwedding day and coincidently on\nVillefort\u2019s betrothal, he is arrested and\nbrought forth to Villefort. The latter\nfinds Bonaparte\u2019s letter but believes\nDant\u00e8s\u2019 plea of innocence. However all\nis lost when he is asked who he was to\ndeliver the letter to, a Noirtier de Villefort, a well known Bonapartist and the\nfather of Villefort. Edmond is hastily\nsentenced to life imprisonment on the\ndreaded island prison of Ch\u00e2teaux d\u2019If.\nIt is here that Edmond spends the next\n14 years of his life, gravitating between\ndevastation and madness. Eventually,\nhe hears digging under the floor of his\ndungeon and begins a tunnel to investigate it. It turns out to be made by an\nold Italian priest, Abb\u00e9 Faria, who in\ntrying to dig for freedom headed in the\nwrong direction. The two are quick to\nbefriend each other and interchange\nbetween their rooms through the use\nof the tunnel. The priest educates the\nsailor in languages, history, econom-ics, philosophy and mathematics. He\nis taught the customs of high society,\nmanners and sophistication. In turn he\ntells the priest the events leading up to\nI don\u2019t care how good the book is, I still want to punch this man\u2019s face\nhis arrest and together they uncover\nthe plot made by his friends against\nhim. Edmond swears to wreak revenge\nupon them; however the priest has\nshows him otherwise, telling him to\nuse his brain as well as his heart to get\nback at them. After years of digging a\nnew tunnel, events turn sour and the\npriest dies. Nonetheless he has time to\ntell Edmond the location of a fantastic\namount of treasure, enough to make\nhim the richest man alive. Not to spoil\none of literatures greatest escapes, we\ngo on to follow Dant\u00e8s in his quest to\nfind the treasure and then on to Paris,\nwhere he finds that his former friends\nhave now all gone on to be successful\nand wealthy. This does not deter him\nand he uses his knowledge of their\nweaknesses to bring them to justice in\nexceptionalfashionandpanache.Along\nthe way he bumps into pirates, villains\nand crooks, acquires a many new images and creates wonders beyond your\nwildest dreams. Many find his tale a\nforerunner of modern celebrity.\nSuch a book doesn\u2019t come so\neasy, notching up some 1000 or so pag-es. Only a fool however, would let this\nput them off as every page is as gripping as the next. The story weaves here\nand there, throwing in new characters\nand plots that converge on a spectacular finale. It is, however, only too easy\nto get lost and somewhat baffled in the\nbeginning with the huge number of\nprimary characters and plot lines. But\nthis just adds to the brilliance of the\nstorytelling and as you quickly become\nfixed upon finding out what happens\nto everyone, the pages rapidly pass in\nexcitement and intrigue.\nDumas, quite cunningly,\ndrops in the characteristic lessons of\nlife along the way, adding depth to the\nnovel. Written over 150 years ago it has\nhardly lost its edge, the style is capti-vating, refreshing even, but most of all\ndaring. Ideals and social conformities\nare swept aside and the doors opened\nto taboo subjects- you could be forgiven thinking that this is a modern novel\nset in a period piece. To the common\neye the book is, quite simply, a story of\nrevenge and does not need to be read\nin detail if the reader doesn\u2019t feel up\nto it. Such is the magic of this author\u2019s\nnarrative.\nDramatic, romantic, adven-turous, deceitful and cunning; its going\nto take a little more than a shrug of the\nshoulders to write this novel off.\nQuotable\n\u201cI maintain my pride in the face of\nmen, but I abandon it before God,\nwho drew me out of nothingness to\nmake me what I am.\u201d\n\n"

It\u2019s also statistically one of the safest ways.\nBut, gliding is not just about launching,\ncircuit and landing; gliding is about flying up to 750km across the UK, from\nYork to Bath to Oxford and back in one\nflight,asquicklyaspossible.Anaverage\nspeed of 100km/hr (60mph) is about\naverage, with high speeds exceeding\n120mph. Racing to finish, gliders can\nregularly exceed 170mph at heights\nbelow 100ft. Gliding is about flying upside down along the airfield and looping and rolling around clouds, almost\nreaching out and touching their soft,\npuffy faces. A young pilot in WW2,\nJohn Gillespie Magee, described it as\nbeing able to \u201cput out my hand and\nThe Imperial College Gliding Club, icGC, introduces the exhilerating sport of gliding and describes their\nsummer tour to Finland. Sally Longstaff reports and recommends a poem that everyone should enjoy\nHigh Flight\nOh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth\nAnd danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;\nSunward I\u2019ve climbed and joined the tumbling mirth\nof sun-split clouds,- and done a hundred things\nYou have not dreamed of- wheeled and soared and swung\nHigh in the sunlit silence. Hov\u2019ring there,\nI\u2019ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung\nMy eager craft through footless falls of air...\nUp, up the long, delirious, burning blue\nI\u2019ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace\nWhere never lark, or ever eagle flew-And, while with silent lifting mind I\u2019ve trod\nThe high, untrespassed sanctity of space,\nPut out my hand and touched the face of God.\nJohn Gillespie Magee\ntouch the face of God\u201d, and when you\nare flying silently you have \u201cslipped the\nsurly bonds of earth\u201d; it really feels like\nan almost spiritual experience.\nA glider flies by basically converting its potential energy in the form of\nheight into kinetic energy in the form\nof speed. It can be thought of as a bicycle freewheeling down a hill. A glider\ncan \u201cdrop\u201d at a very slow rate, and at\na very shallow angle, sometimes in excess of 40:1 (meaning that for every 1ft\nin height, the glider can glide 40ft for-wards). At the top of the average launch\n(about 1500ft) a glider can fly for about\n5-8 minutes. To top up the energy, the\nglider can use rising columns of air, or\nthermals, to gain height, and therefore\nprolong the flight. As you can imagine,\nit is therefore a constant battle flying\ncross country to keep the glider in the\nair.\nI\u2019ve heard people say that gliding isn\u2019t\na sport. Yes, it\u2019s not all that physical, except for rigging the gliders (the wings\nweigh about 80kg each), and then de\nrigging them again in the evening.\nBut it is amazingly competitive and\nflipping hard work. How many other\nsports have races that last for 10 hours,\nwhere you concentrate every second,\nand requires you to map read, spot\nclouds, think tactically, avoid airspace,\nwhilst flying on your own at speeds approaching 120mph in a cockpit which\ncan heat up to 50 degrees of heat? In\nmy opinion, this is enough to make it\nan exciting and incredibly intricate\nsport.\nicGC, which is one of the four\nfounder gliding clubs in the country,\nand one of the oldest Imperial College\nclubs, aims to teach students to fly, and\nprogress through to championship lev-els. In recent years our members have\ncompeted in national and international\nlevels. Great Britain dominates gliding,\nhaving four current World Champions and one European Champion and\nhave been the most successful gliding\nteam in the world for almost a dec-ade. Every year the club goes on three\ntours: the Christmas tour is usually to\na club which uses different skills than\nour usual club, Lasham. This is usually in Scotland or Wales, using hill\nlift; the Easter tour is a training tour,\nwhich usually involves intensive flying to progress members who joined\nin October, hopefully to solo; the\nSummer tour is a month long and in\nthe last years have been to Spain, the\nCzech Republic, Germany, Slovakia,\nand Slovenia.\nThe 2007 tour was to Rayskala in\nsouthern Finland for the month of July.\nArmed with the three club gliders, the\nGrob 103C, a Discus, and an ASW-24,\nand plenty of Red Bull, icGC left the\nUK with the hope of getting a little slice\n\u201cRacing to\nfinish, gliders\ncan regularly\nexceed 170mph\nat heights below\n100ft.\u201d\n\n"

However this did\nnot faze them and five minutes into the\nfirst half, the first try was scored by Samantha Pemberton. Followed closely\nby Roxanne Crossley, Courtney Burtenshaw and Jess Alcena bringing the\ntotal at the end of the first half to 32-0\nwith conversions being scored by Vice\nCaptain Roxanne Crossley.\nThe second half began with the Virgins being pre warned by Coach John\nSykes and Captain Elena Bailey against\ncomplacency, ready to defend against\nthe sheer ferocity of the opposition,\nwho were fueled by frustration from\nthe first half. The Virgins responded\nwith skill, with both the backs and\nthe forwards performing as a cohesive\nunit, recycling the ball and using the\nfull width of the pitch to gain advan-tage. However the game began to slow\ndown, constantly interrupted by injury\non the opposition\u2019s side and mistakes\nbeing made on both sides, including\nnaked frog ploughing into the referee\nand knocking him over in an attempt\nto tackle the opposition. This worked\nin the Virgins favour as the opposition\u2019s\nbelching number two was no match for\nTheresa Wright the hooker (and forward of the match) who stole the ball\ntime and time again and passed to the\nbacks, who dodged, dashed and ran\ncircles around the opposition. Writtle\neventually scored their only try of the\nmatch mostly due to laziness on our\npart, The First Lady herself even quoting that \u2018she wasn\u2019t tired but couldn\u2019t\nbe arsed running any more\u2019. But the\nVirgins responded with more tries\nbringing the final total to 50-5.

Good for you I say, as will others I\u2019m sure. However there is another\nside\u2026\nI was reading through some fan mail\nrecently and I came across some messages which can generally be read as\nfollows:\nDearest Mr Muscle, I have been\nreading your article in recent weeks\nand must say I am very impressed by\nyour desire to help those who may benefit from your gym expertise. I too am\nimpressed by your immortal mass and\nunparalleled definition, which is only\nmatched by your quick turn of word\nand adept use of the English language,\nto provide a thoroughly enjoyable read.\nHowever, as is my inane nature, I find\nit necessary to hate on your success. I\nmust hate on your training techniques.\nGranted these are the very techniques\nthat have helped you attain an Olympian physique, and, had I been bothered\nto research, I would find that they are\nalso based on the workouts of some of\nthe most successful bodybuilders such\nas 8 time Mr Olympia, Ronnie Coleman and furthermore backed up by\nworld renowned exercise institutes.\nHowever you are unqualified as per paper qualifications, and therefore I must\nlook past any evidence of their success\nas it gives me an opportunity to hate on\nyou. I have never stepped into a gym,\npreferring the docile environment behind the computer from which I send\nyou this message, and as such have no\nidea what good training technique in-volves, but seeing your success inspires\nmy hate. True, I wish not get bigger,\nbut as I watch you excel in this field I\nfeel the need to besmirch your name.\nI understand I will be depriving Imperial College this great commodity,\nbut I think only for myself, and to put\nyou down will satisfy me more than\nany women/ man could.\nLove and kisses your number 1 player hater.\nObviously this is just an excerpt but\nyou get the picture. Usually I don\u2019t pay\nattention to this sort of hate mail, but\nI thought it important to warn all my\nbudding gym enthusiasts as to what\nthe future holds. Sure a vast majority\nof people will commend the fruits of\nyour labour in the gym, but a few select haters will not be happy to see you\nthrive. They will try and put you down,\npitying their own lack of definition,\nand hope to knock your confidence. To\nthese haters I give thanks, as your hate\nconfirms the success of others. Without darkness there is no light, and the\nlight at the end of your tunnel of dark\nhate is confirmation of excellence.\nThe best way of responding to hate\nis by doing your thing and being a suc-cess, be like Gandhi and practice non\nviolence. 9 out of 10 haters will never\nsay anything to your face, underlying\nthe weakness in character. I can respect\na person that steps to me as a man and\nchallenges my techniques, with good\narguments. Simply saying that my\ntechniques are rubbish is whack, because I have 8kg of lean muscle over 3\nyears that tells me otherwise. So bring\nyour hate, because I\u2019m still going to do\nmy thing and write to entertain. Readers, you keep doing your thing, revel\nin the hate because hate is the inbred\ncousin of admiration.\nSome things, unlike Victoria Beckham\u2019s bra size, will never change. Haters are going to hate. Just carry on\ngyming and being the person you want\nto be. I believe Energia are offering new\nworkouts, check it out it may be good\nstuff. But I\u2019m still here to entertain and\nmotivate the masses and keep you haters in check.\nBelieve that!\nChiraush Patel\nMr. Muscle\nHater mail for Mr. Muscle\nRugby 1st halt Hertfordshire\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nRugby\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XV 20\nHertforshire Men\u2019s 1st XV 19\nAfter last weeks disappointing performance against Brunel, the 1st XV\nwere ready to make amends. The majority of the changes to the side for this\nweeks fixture were made in the backs,\nwith most of the positions being filled\nby debutantes.\nToday\u2019s match was against Hertfordshire, who have slowly been working their way up the league tables,\na progress which was undoubtedly\nhelped by the Saracens academy. However their progressive climb through\nthe league tables was going to come to\nan end as the 1st team had something\nto prove.\nThe first half was, for lack of a better\nword, sensational; forwards and backs\nwere working in complete harmony\nand our discipline was unparalleled.\nWithin the first 10 minutes, Imperial\nhad managed to secure a penalty, which\nthe hooker Alex Johnstone easily con-verted. The forwards then decided to\nflex their muscles a bit and orchestrated a well trained rolling maul off a lin-eout, which Alex Johnstone scored. It\nwas then the turn of the backs to show\ntheir skills, which they did magnificently off a scrum where Rob Phillipps\nscored the try which was converted.\nHertfordshire were given no chance\nto do anything useful, and as such the\nscore was 15 - 0 at half time.\nAfter the great morale boosting performance of the first half, things went\na little downhill. Hertfordshire began\nto show signs of why they have been\nworking their way up the leagues, and\nthings weren\u2019t helped by Imperial\u2019s\ncaptain Andrew Jasudasen being sin\nbinned for killing the ball. In the brief\n10 minutes that he was off, Hertfordshire managed to score 19 points, leaving Imperial on the back foot.\nHowever, once the captain, and Twat\nof the Match, came back on the pitch,\nthe team rallied together and scored\nanother rolling maul try, this time with\nTom Zeal putting the ball over the try\nline. Hertfordshire again increased the\nintensity, and managed to get a penalty in the last play of the game, which\nluckily for Imperial went wide of the\nposts and gave them a very narrow 20\n- 19 win.\nSpecial mention has to go to Man\nof the Match Alex Johnstone for his\nall round performance, as well as the\ndebutantes Giles Mumford and Max\nJoachim.\nImperial setting up a solid defensive line against Hertfordshire\n\n"

Essex 2nds received the kick-off to find\nthemselves swept away by the IC for-wards, who turned the ball over.

The Forwards dominated in\nwhat proved to be a display of sheer\npower and with their support, the\nbacks just kept running the ball into\nspace. With Essex on the back foot, IC\nfound it relatively comfortable to play\nsome beautiful moves and tries were\nscored by outside centre Tom, wing\nMax \u201ccoolest name on the planet\u201d Steel\nand other wing Josh. Two of these were\nconverted to result in a 31-0 score.\nOverall a triumphant day for the IC\n3rd XV who duly celebrated on the bus\njourney back with a few fresher songs,\nsome baby jokes and the presentation\nof the Man of the Match Trophy (cour-tesy of Pete Lee and Orlando) to Mick.\nIC 3rd XV shut out Essex\nBack again for its fifth year, the infamous wakeboarding beach party\nkicked off the 2007 year.\nFor the uneducated amongst us\nwakeboarding is a combination of\nsnowboarding and waterskiing. It can\nbe done behind a boat, using the wake\nto throw yourself in the air, or for the\npoorer folk it can be done on a large\ncircle cable. More advanced riders can\nuse jumps and rails (kickers and sliders\nin our lingo) to throw some big tricks,\nor land on their head!\nThe beach party is an opportunity for\n50 newbies to come and have a go, enjoy a BBQ and watch some pro riders\nshow them how it\u2019s done. They start off\non kneeboards (large foam tea-trays)\nto get used to the cable and progress\nonto wakeboards. This year we had a\nparticularly lively bunch of newbies.\nThey dealt with the cold with elegance,\nand kept smiling and bouncing all af-ternoon. Although this was the first\ntime for many some guys stood up and\ngot all the way round, and others struggled to get off the dock. As someone\nwho spent 6 weeks trying to get round\nthe first corner I can tell you perseverance is the key..and its well worth it! All\nthe more advanced members are really\nkeen to help everyone progress, and we\nrun termly weekend tours to give you\nsome more intense coaching.\nBig thanks to Relentless for providing us with crates of free drink to keep\nus all pumping, and to all the guys at\nJBs for keeping the tunes pumping and\nthe cable running.\nIf you\u2019re interested in coming wakeboarding with us then email our club\nPresident, John Hawkins on jh806@\nic.ac.uk or go on our club page for\nmore details: www.imperialcollege-union.org.

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nFriday 26 October 2007 felix\nNews\nA mystery to many undergraduates,\nand most frequently viewed as a welcome day-off, Commemoration Day is\na ceremony full of pomp and tradition\nthat brings students back to College in\ntheir thousands, eager to attend with\ntheir families despite the cost.\nWednesday\u2019s Centenary Commemoration Day saw the greatest number of\ngraduating students in the history of\nthe college, and marks a key point in\nthe path of Imperial College: its cente-nary, coinciding with the last generation of 100% University of London degrees before the first Imperial College\ndegrees are awarded to undergraduates\nnext year. The day remains an important date in the College\u2019s calendar for\nstudents and staff alike.\nIn 1945, King George VI and the\nQueen Mother visited Imperial College to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Royal\nCollege of Chemistry, the oldest of the\ninstitutions that were amalgamated\ninto Imperial College in 1907. It was\ndecided that this royal visit would be\ncommemorated annually, and it is this\nceremony, held in the Royal Albert\nHall, at which Imperial undergraduate\nstudents celebrate graduation.\nTo attend this ceremony costs the average student between \u00a3120 and \u00a3150,\ncovering the hire of robes, ceremony\ntickets for themselves and two guests,\nand a professional portrait to record\nthe occasion. This is a price that most\nare willing to pay for their \u201cbig day,\u201d\nalthough many students surveyed by\nFelix voiced concern at the high price\ncharged for simple robe hire, and felt\nthat the \u00a330 charged for a portrait of the\nstudent alone was \u201cfar too expensive\u201d.\n\u201cCollege can charge what they like\nfor graduation, and they know we\u2019ll pay\nit,\u201d said one student, \u201cthe Royal Albert\nHall is worth the price, but everything\nelse is a bit of a rip-off.\u201d\nFelix spoke to graduating students,\nmost of whom were broadly positive\nabout their time here at Imperial. The\nCommemoration Day to remember\nFelix was there to quiz the graduates, listen intently to the Rector\u2019s speech and soak up the atmosphere\nAndrew Somerville\nNews Editor\noft-imparted advice to other students\nwas to \u201cget involved in clubs and socie-ties. Pick one to be involved with for\nthe rest of your university career, and\nwork hard,\u201d and to \u201cuse London, it\u2019s on\nyour doorstep so don\u2019t just talk about\ndoing stuff, actually do it.\u201d\nThe overwhelmingly positive atmosphere was doubtlessly influenced by\nthe combined factors of elation following the culmination of three or more\nyears of hard work, and a genuinely inspirational speech from the Rector, Sir\nRichard Sykes, in his last Commemoration day address before Sir Roy Anderson succeeds him next summer.\nSpeaking about the number of students graduating on the day, he quoted\nWoody Allen in saying that \u201c80% of\nsuccess is just showing up,\u201d leaving\nsome wondering whether it\u2019s been too\nlong since Sir Richard sat an exam. He\nalso discussed his impending departure from College, and followed by\nstating that he is now certain that Imperial\u2019s education is \u201censuring the economic competitiveness and security of\nnations.\u201d He then shrugged off criticisms of College\u2019s alleged lack of care\nfor its students and its businesslike and\ncorporate attitudes, saying: \u201cOur students are the greatest achievement of\nthe College.\u201d\nHowever, the most interesting parts\nLord Browne\nIn a controversial decision, one of\nthe three honorary degrees awarded on Wednesday was a doctorate\ngiven to Lord Browne of Madingly, the ex-CEO of BP whose stellar\ncareer came to an end in May as\nhe resigned in disgrace.\nLord Browne was widely tipped\nwithin College circles to be the\nprime candidate for the position\nof Rector as Sir Richard Sykes\u2019\nsuccessor until he was forced to\nresign from BP earlier this year:\n19 months before his planned retirement date. His rapid departure\nwas caused by the discovery that\nhe had lied in court over press\nallegations surrounding his relationship with Jeff Chevalier, a gay\nescort. Lord Browne was one of\nthe most successful homosexual\nmen in business, but preferring\nto keep his personal life private:\nhe attempted, in January, to block\npress allegations that he met his\nlover through an online escort\nagency, claiming in court that they\nhad met elsewhere. He was subsequently found to have lied, and\npotentially faced a perjury charge.\nSoon after his resignation, it became clear that he would not be\noffered the position as Rector. Instead, Roy Anderson was named\nas the next Rector of Imperial College late this summer. It is thought\nthat Lord Browne\u2019s honorary\ndoctorate could be considered as\na \u201cconsolation prize\u201d after being\nexcluded from the running.\nSingapore\nGraduation\nImperial College is to hold a separate graduation ceremony for students in Asia in late November \u201cto\ncelebrate the College\u2019s relationship with Asia and its Centenary\nyear.\u201d Imperial currently has approximately 2500 students from\ncountries across Asia, and this\ngraduation ceremony is being\nheld in Singapore in an unprecedented change to its celebratory\ntraditions.\nWhen asked for comment, students found this a strange deci-sion, but understandable in gen-eral. One overseas student from\nShanghai said that he \u201cdefinitely\npreferred coming to England [to\ngraduate],\u201d and several home students posed the question: \u201cWhy\ndoesn\u2019t the College do something special over here [for the\nCentenary]?\u201d\nWhilst not ostensibly a sinister decision, worries have been\nvoiced from several quarters that\nin an increasingly divided student\npopulation, some of the overseas\nstudents might become divorced\nfrom the traditions of Imperial\nCollege entirely if the arrangement becomes permanent, excluding them from the one event\nthat is intended to bring all graduates together under one roof for a\nsingle grandiose event.\nof the speech came as he imparted\nsome genuine advice to the new graduates before him.\n\u201cYou will spend most of your life\nworking. Make sure that you do something that you believe in,\u201d he said, before he clarified his position in the education debate, saying, \u201cYou can have\nmany careers. I never dreamt, when I\nentered industry, that in years to come\nthe qualities which I would gain would\nbe the same ones that Imperial would\nbe looking for in a Rector,\u201d encouraging\nthose whose careers will have little in\ncommon with their degree titles, and\nthose whose idealism still has the lead\nover pragmatism.\nSir Richard Sykes makes his last Commemoration Day speech as Rector\nThe Royal Albert Hall was at full capacity with a sea of graduates\nThis portrait only cost the couple \u00a39.99 including postage\nPHOTOGRAPHS\nBY\nVITALI\nLAZURENKO\n\n"

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Alex Casey\nDavid Cronenberg: From body horror to auteur\nDarkness falls across the land...\nFew events leave one as perplexed as\nlistening to David Cronenberg speak.\nAny research done on this man and\nhis body of work over the past thirty\nyears suggests that caution should be\nexercised in dealing with a person who\nrevels in darkness as much as this. A\nman who describes the AIDS virus as\na triumph in disease evolution rather\nthan the scourge of the world, I await\na similar intensity in his demeanour\nas he walks into our conference in the\nbasement of the Soho Hotel.\nThen something happens that seems\nto catch everyone in the room off\nguard. He takes his seat next to a rather nervous Naomi Watts and the more\ncomfortable Vincent Cassel, stars of\nhis latest film Eastern Promises, and\nrolls off some quip about the mountain\nof dictaphones under his microphone.\nNothing too special there to consider,\nbut in an instant the image of this morbid goremonger vanishes and the expectation of the crowd is flattened.\nThis leaves a gulf that is filled with\ninane questions about Naomi\u2019s recent\npregnancy or the motorbike that she\nhas to ride during the film and it seems\nthat Cronenberg\u2019s humour has left him\nsadly human. But as the course runs,\na deeper sense of character emerges,\nunforced and with the fluidity of blood\nemerging from a wound (a metaphor\nhe would no doubt approve of) as the\noft-cited king of \u201cbody horror\u201d blends\ndiscussion of beheadings with babies,\nslavery with cinema and truth with\nterror.\nFor the uninitiated, Cronenberg first\ncame to prominence in the seventies\nwith a number of films that would later\ncome to be known under the genre\numbrella of \u201cbody horror\u201d, a subgenre\nin which the body undergoes some\nsort of transformation or infection,\nwith Cronenberg famously stating that\nhe wanted to show films from the point\nof view of the disease. The idea of a foreign organism crippling the sanctuary\nof the body from within was explored\nin Rabid, in which he cast a porn star\nas a crash victim who undergoes a skin\ngraft that leaves him with anomalies\nresembling an anus and a phallus in\nher armpit, and his more commercially\nsuccessful remake of the old Vincent\nPrice B-movie, The Fly. Chances are\nthere was a time at school when you\nheard of his film Crash as well, where\nautoeroticism derives new meaning as\na group of thrill seekers take to causing car crashes to arouse themselves.\nChances are there were a few red faces\nwhen people went out to rent the latest\nHis works leave little room for laughs, but there\u2019s more to David Cronenberg than his oeuvre may suggest\nPaul Haggis film of the same name and\ndidn\u2019t read the back of the box carefully enough...\nSo is it all just controversy for the\nsake of controversy? Why is there such\na darkness in his works and yet such\njoviality in his personal demeanour?\nHe doesn\u2019t hesitate in his response to\nthis question: \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of a balancing thing. Most artists are interested in\nexploring places that are not normally\nexplored. It\u2019s a matter of curiosity for\none thing and I think there\u2019s always this\nfeeling that you will discover something really significant or profound\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nGreat performances mean that festival opener delivers on its Promises\nEastern Promises is getting a very\nearly release here for a film that only\npremiered at the London Film Festival\nlast week, but given the adulation it received there and it\u2019s recent reception\nat the Toronto, where it won the main\nprize, could it be that it is relying only\non word of mouth to make it a success?\nWell, whilst this is obviously a factor,\nEastern Promises is more than just festival fodder.\nThe story of Eastern Promises begins\nwith nurse Anna (Naomi Watts) trying\nto hunt out a family for a baby born in\nher ward to a mother who died during\nchildbirth. She takes the girl\u2019s diary,\nwritten in Russian, and tries to track\ndown any relative with the help of her\nuncle (who conveniently happens to be\nan old Russian relic of the KGB days),\nbut her search takes her deep into the\nworld of people trafficking, child prostitution and murder, all overseen by a\nRussian mafia family, headed by Armin\nMueller Stahl and with Viggo Mortenson and Vincent Cassel running the\noperations from the street. With intimidation from all sides, how far is\nAnna willing to go to secure a home\nfor the baby?\nRealism and true motivation seem to\ntake a backseat in this journey through\nAlex Casey\nEastern Promises \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: David Cronenberg\nWriter: Steve Knight\nCast: Naomi Watts,\nViggo Mortensen,\nVincent Cassel\na seedy London underworld that most\nof us are happy to bypass. Whilst I\u2019m\nsure Anna is a very nice person, there\nare few people who would take the\nwellbeing of a new born child as reason enough to go messing with the\nmafia when social services would be a\n(slightly) more reliable bet.\nThe dynamics of the family itself provide a more intriguing character study.\nWhilst Mortensen plays a driver to the\nfamily rather than a blood member, his\ninclusion into the inner circle at the\nexpense of the true son, played by Cassel, explores the connections of family\nand loyalty in a manner similar to The\nGodfather.\nBesides plot however, the cinematography of Promises gives a stunning\nevocation of an immigrant community establishing itself in London. The\nrichness of the family\u2019s restaurant base\nfeels as though it activates more senses\nthan simple sight and hearing and Cronenberg\u2019s calm direction gives it all the\nmore time to be savoured.\nThe true gem here however is the\nacting, with Viggo Mortensen putting\nAragorn well and truly behind him.\nHis immersion in the role here is genuinely enchanting and his scenes are the\nbest in the film.\nWatts and Cassel add to the accent\nsoup, with Watts doing her English\nrose best and Cassel navigating English in a Russian accent from his native\n\u201cMortenson\u2019s\nimmersion in\nthe role here\nis genuinely\nenchanting\u201d\nFrench, but neither hit the same highs\nas Viggo.\nWhilstthefilmitselfmaynotreachits\nfull potential, there is definitely something here that is worth the buzz it has\ngenerated. And with the Litvinenko\ncase directly interrupting the filming,\nthis is a topical interpretation of Russian influence in the post-Soviet era.\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you in Lord of the Rings?\u201d\nabout human nature, about yourself,\nabout the human condition, if you go\nto those places as opposed to the more\nmundane everyday places that we all\nknow. I think an artist has a desire to\nuncover things that are hidden and you\ndon\u2019t want things to be hidden. You\nwant to uncover what\u2019s going on and so\nyou dig after what\u2019s really going on and\nthat\u2019s what leads you into dark places\nbecause when there\u2019s no light, things\nhappen that are hidden.\u201d\nCronenberg\u2019s latest two offerings, A\nHistory of Violence and Eastern Promises, are not in quite the same visceral\nvein as many of his previous works,\nyet when viewed as a diptych prove to\nbe a fascinating study of the violence\nthat underpins society in various ways.\nViggo Mortensen leads both pieces\nand acts as a visual link between the\npair but Cronenberg\u2019s directorial style\nleaves no doubt the two are connected\nmore intrinsically. His framing of dramatic scenes is more tailored to observation than involvement or exaggeration as is commonplace with so many\ndirectors.\nThis feature of his films makes marketing tough, especially when the competition try to make trailers as dramatic as possible. The subject matter\nof Cronenberg\u2019s film makes it easy to\nsensationalise them: A family man who\nfoils an armed robbery and is then pursued by an organised crime unit forms\nthe crux of History. But with the focus\non story rather than dramatics, recent\nCronenberg can be a disappointment\nfor those who fancy a fast paced action flick. Italian arthouse master Fellini once proclaimed that his own style\ntold \u201crealistic stories in an unrealistic\nway\u201d. Cronenberg, in this sense, is the\nopposite.\nThe intrigue of his character matches that of his stories, however. Hearing\nhim discuss the intimacy of a knife killing sends chills down your spine and\nhis unapologetic frankness in comparing beheadings and bombings aligns\nhis self-projection with that of his cin-ema. Until he makes another joke and\nwe\u2019re back to square one.\nIt is no surprise that someone so beguiling has been chosen to front the\nopening of London\u2019s prestigious film\nfestival. His eye for detail is truly artistic and when he speaks of his work,\nhe does so with an authenticity that\nwould place him above many of his\ncontemporaries.\nThis isn\u2019t the voice of a beginner trying to justify themselves through discussion of their \u201cprocess\u201d. Instead it is\nthe voice of consummate professional-ism. A voice with more sides to it than\neven his films can achieve.\n28 felix Friday 26 October 2007\n\n"

Actually\nthree brand new halls\nof residence located on\nthe site of the old Southside building,\nwhich some staff and students still remember and tell horror stories about.\nNow many good people, including experienced wardens and long serving\nmembers of the residences staff, had\nwarned me what it would be like to\nshare a room in a new hall but nothing\ncould have prepared me for the highs\nand lows of the first month and the incredible effort on the part of everyone\ninvolved!\nTraditionally, the week before move-in day (a.k.a. Hall Senior week) is a\nvery busy time for Wardens, Hall seniors and Residence staff. On this occa-sion, however, the party was joined by\na few senior members of college staff, a\nlarge number of builders and contrac-tors, and a regiment of students paid to\nget all the little (and not so little) jobs\ndone in time for arrival day.\nAnd then the kick-off. Between\n8:00am and 8:00pm on Saturday September 29th, in Falmouth Keogh alone,\nwe moved in 150 students, and an extra\nfew hundred parents (that we also had\nto move out shortly afterwards). And\nall this adjacent to the poshest building\nsite that South Kensington has to offer,\ndecorated to the highest standard with\nautumnal leaf designs.\nAs with many other halls, we used\na few of the tried and tested Fresher\nwelcome events \u2013 formal dinners, boat\ntrips, welcome BBQs and IC Union\nevents to name but a few. Unlike other\nhalls the trio at Southside (Selkirk Hall,\nTizard Hall, and Falmouth Keogh Hall)\ntook it upon themselves to try a large\nscale joint event in the form of a fancy\ndress Olympics. Yes you heard it, three\nhalls, three fancy dress themes and as\nmany silly competitions as you can fit\nunder one tent on the Queen\u2019s Lawn.\nI won\u2019t go into the details of too\nmany individual event results, mainly\nbecause numbers remain extremely\ncontroversial to this day. It should be\nnoted, however, that the Zombies in\nPyjamas from Falmouth Keogh made\nan excellent start in the limbo com-petition, Tizard\u2019s Animals and Farmers were very strong in the high speed\ncream cracker eating, and Selkirk put\nin an impressive performance on the\nfootball pitch with both their Schoolboys and Schoolgirls clinching key\nvictories.\nIn the final reckoning, once dancing\nability and costumes had been taken\ninto account, most agree that Selkirk\nwere the overall victors on the night. I\nlike to console myslef in the fact that\nit\u2019s never easy being dressed as a penguin or a member of the undead in\nnight time attire.\nI like to think Lord Falmouth and\nSir Alfred Keogh (yes, they were two\npeople) would have been pleased with\nmy efforts in the warden\u2019s Space Hopper race which proved to be one of the\nmost contentious events of the night,\nand one of the most enjoyable for stu-dents. The rumours that three shady\nindividuals have booked Ethos for regular space-hoppering sessions through\nthe next year are, of course, completely\nunfounded.\nWardening the\nAlmighty Organ\nI\nrealise that what I said last week\nmay have caused some alarm,\nand for that I\u2019m very sorry. To\nclear up any confusion that I\ncaused, I\u2019m going to set the\nrecord straight this week \u2013 I\u2019m definitely not left-wing. If any of you were\nworrying that I swung the other way,\nplease put your minds at rest. That\u2019s\nnot to say that I\u2019m voting Conservative, necessarily \u2013 my opinion on Boris\nJohnson is as steadfast as a bet on a\nKen Livingstone landslide \u2013 but it does\nmean that most of my political views\nveer away from the red beret and more\ntowards, yes, that whiny twat you knew\nin the sixth form who ended up reading PPE at Oxford.\nAllow me to elucidate. This week\u2019s\nAngry Geek comes to you from my local Starbucks \u2013 the most convenient\nway to exploit the third world without\nleaving the comfort of the high street\nor going into H&M. I\u2019m sitting here,\npen in hand, breathing in the delightful\nsmell of an Americano, dusted with the\nbroken backs and shattered dreams of\nsouth American coffee growers. And\nI\u2019m okay with it. Because, unfortunate-ly, I enjoy the poor being poor.\nI\u2019m not just saying this to get a knee-jerk here \u2013 there\u2019s no easy way to say\nthat you support the obviously unfair\ntreatment of millions of people. But I\ndo. I think it\u2019s a necessary part of the\nsmooth running of the world, and\nmore importantly I think it\u2019s the lesser\nof two evils.\nYou see, I don\u2019t really want equality.\nAnd it\u2019s not because I\u2019m afraid someone\u2019s going to turn up here one day and\nbe able to solve quadratic equations\nfaster than me. Believe me, I can fac-torise those bad boys faster than you\ncan write a letter complaining about\nthe ever-decreasing standard of Felix\u2019s\ncomments page. It\u2019s because equality of\nlife is stupid if it\u2019s forced upon people.\nTake, for instance, Third World Debt.\nI\u2019m all for cancelling it. I think it\u2019s a\ngreat idea, because the kind of debt that\nmentally rapes even the idea of getting\naccountants in is obviously a lose-lose\nsituation for everyone involved. I don\u2019t\ngo for the usual Right-y line of bleeding\nthe bastards dry because they\u2019re not\nPLU. Cancel the debt \u2013 lovely. Actually\nstart dishing out money and support in\norder to get everyone on a level playing field afterwards? Not really such a\ngood idea.\nCountries go through a delicate\nprocess of modernisation once they\nbegin developing. Agricultural Revolution, Industrial Revolution, Political\nRevolution and Dance Dance Evolution. Whether or not the J-Pop arcade\nclassic was evolutionary rather than\nmerely a rehashing of the genre is one\nbest left for the games journalists, but\nthe preceding three stages, no matter\nwhat order they come in, have to be\ngone through at a sensible pace. Not\nunlike the J-Pop arcade classic itself.\nSimilarly, I don\u2019t think that shoving everyone into a higher education\ndegree is a fantastic idea either \u2013 not\nbecause it means there\u2019s less room for\npeople from public schools, because\ntruth be told I\u2019m about as common\nas they come except that instead of\nwatching ITV in the evenings I\u2026 well,\nI don\u2019t want ITV in the evenings. It\u2019s\nbecause it means there\u2019s less room,\nboth in universities and in the public\npsyche, for students who are genuinely\nup for their courses.\nI think prejudice is as retarded as the\nnext internet meme. This week in the\nBook section, I pick apart bit by bit a\nbook that is so awful, so completely,\nretardedly awful, that I can\u2019t believe\nanyone agreed to publish it, author\ncredentials or no. But that does not\nmean that I skip around all day looking for ways to make the world equal.\nIt\u2019s not. The truth is the world is painfully unequal, and attempts to balance\nthings that are inherently imbalanced\n\u2013 through our influence centuries ago\nor not \u2013 ends in everything spilling\nover and the world going wrong.\nT\nhe Royal College of Science of Union (RCSU) is\nthe constituent faculty\nunion for the scientists at\nImperial and we\u2019re being\nproactive in making sure our students\nare happy! On Monday 29th October\nwe\u2019ve got a Halloween themed bar\nnight in the Union bar with \u00a32 entry for\nthose in fancy dress and \u00a33 for those\nboring people who aren\u2019t! (No extra\ncharge for non scientists.) Drink all of\nour kegs and bottles dry! And expect\nto find mummy rolling competitions,\nyard of ale competitions and spooky\ngiveaways!\nBut it\u2019s not all about rollicking so-cials. Now all of the year reps have\nbeen elected we\u2019ll be finding out what\nyou really think of your academic life\nat Imperial. The National Student Survey highlighted some common themes\nwhich Imperial students are unhappy\nabout so it\u2019s high time we encouraged\ncollege to sort it out! Assessment and\nfeedback seems to be the largest area\nwhere students are unhappy \u2013 how\nmuch feedback do you get about your\nwork and how long does it take for your\nwork to be returned to you? In the early\nstages of investigation I don\u2019t think our\nlecturers and tutors are at fault \u2013 most\nof us seem to be more than satisfied\nwith our teaching and support from\nindividual staff members, but are there\nenough of them and are they under too\nmuch pressure in other areas so that\nthey do not have enough time to give\nus feedback on our work? That\u2019s one\nexample but we also want to find out\nabout your workloads, IT access, lecture notes and printing costs, and are\nyou being crowded out of your lecture\ntheatre \u2013 are there too many people\non your course? We could go on\u2026. It\u2019s\nworth mentioning that Imperial is actually rated very highly in overall satisfaction from students so we also want\nto find out what you\u2019re really happy\nwith and give credit where credit\u2019s due\ntoo!\nObviously it\u2019s not all about academia\n\u2013 that\u2019s only part of university life!\nWhat we have noticed is how many\ncontinuing students are finding it increasingly difficult to get private accommodation sorted out. Rent costs\nare rocketing in the capital! We might\nnot be able to bring down your rent but\nwe can make sure the private accommodation office can provide enough\ninformation and support. Share your\nviews with us.\nSo what happens when we get all this\ninformation? We won\u2019t just sit on it I\npromise! If used to its full potential the\nresources are already in place to turn\nthis information into action. There are\nloads of committees in college and the\nunion where all of these issues can be\nthrown up and acted upon. The only\ntrouble is making the people on those\ncommittees more proactive in what\nthey do. I\u2019ve sat on too many committees where too much time has been\nspent on arguing the correct wording\nand punctuation of section 3.4.1\u2026 but\nwith more training being provided this\nyear lets keep our fingers crossed for a\nturn around!\nIt\u2019s not that nobody cares about student democracy... most people don\u2019t\neven know about it and that\u2019s the\nproblem.\nExploitation: A coffee bean farmer\n\n"

The Artist, who prefers to remain unnamed, is rumoured to have\ncreated this masterpiece whilst in a fit\nof rage after losing a long\n\u2018Battleships\u2019 game to a\ncomputer.\nNeedless to say\nthis picture\ngives me\na head-Student Art in Focus: \u201cVan Gogh was a hack\u201d\nIn our ongoing bid to desecrate all forms of artistic criticism, we turn this week to red squares and lines\nThis week\u2019s piece \u2013 One Day I Shall Win, You Bastard by Anonymous\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nBack to School \u2013 Jane Eyre\nF\nrankly, it is without a doubt,\na work of pure quality. I remember reading it in class\nwayback in Year 7. Such a\nlong time ago. This was the\nfirst time that I had properly started to\ndelve into the classics. From then on,\nJane Eyre has been the epitome of female strength and morality. A heroine\nthat has captured the hearts of many\ngenerations. It\u2019s an epic romance that\nis laced with mystery, suspense and\ndrama. Set in England in the 1800s,\nsurely Bronte paints a sublimely realistic portrayal of the time period and the\nstyle of living back in those\nolden days.\nFrom the narrative point\nof view, I would say that it\nis eminently personal and\neloquent. The first person narrative gives such a\nbreathtakingly wonderful\nway of connecting with the\nreader. You certainly feel\nas though Jane is a living,\nbreathing entity. Bronte\u2019s\nsophistication allows Jane\nto present a shrewd, almost autobiographical, account of her\nlife, from inauspicious terrible beginnings as an unloved orphan living in\ndeplorable state to a compromised climatic resolved ending.\nWe, as the reader, feel distinct pain\nand loneliness as the protagonist\u2019s\nchildhood living with her aunt and\ncousins in Gateshead encompasses\nbeing confined to sheer torture, both\nphysical and mental, and is not nurturing to say the least. I really enjoyed\nhow Bronte seemed to weave everything together in the progression from\nchildhood to adulthood, from Gateshead, Lowood to Thornfield Hall, and\nit is told in exquisitely powerful verse.\nOne seems to gain strength as Jane\nache. The artist is trying to tell us\nso much and ram heaps of symbolism and metaphor into our lowly\nheads that we as common people\ncannot look at it without cringing\nand trying to turn away in anguish.\nSo much so that when the piece\nwas exhibited in its full size (25m x\n52m) in the Tate Modern, the room\nwas rarely populated at all. However I have taken several Ibuprofens\nin preparation and am ready to un-twine his train of thought.\nThe obvious theme of this piece is\npremature ejaculation while more\ndiscreet undercurrents of invasion and illness are present. The\nred rectangular \u2018beasts\u2019 are clearly\nhoming in on the indistinct shape\nin the centre. Vulnerable and alone,\nthe attackers rip and tear at the\nperfect body, distorting its limbs\nand ruining its symmetry. This has\nblatant parallels with the paparazzi\nand Jodie Marsh, but could also be\na satire on the theme of Christmas\nshopping. Crazed shoppers rush\ntowards the displays of organic\nturkeys and rip them apart in des-peration. Fillets may fly.\nBut what of the mystery shape that\nis appearing at the top right of the\npicture? Is it the cure (no, not the\nband, you fuckwit)? Is it a garden\ngnome\u2019s falling from the metaphorical sky? Or is it the next piece\nof revolutionary art by The Artist\nwaiting to outwit this one and its\ncritics? He certainly keeps us hanging onto the edge of our seats and\nI, for one, can\u2019t wait for the next\ninstalment.\nThis week\u2019s criticism was by Dr\nT. Pea\nDr T.

Money can\u2019t buy caps that stylish\nleaps from an insecure, pained young\ngirl to maturity where she develops her\nown sense of inner strength that is palpable when facing times of adversity\nand uncertainty.\nThe repertoire of fascinating characters is indeed compelling, with Edward Rochester (Jane\u2019s love interest)\ndefinitely being on the same scale as\nMr Darcy, as many Austen fans would\nagree; both dark, brooding, handsome\nand difficult to win over. The mystery\nwith Grace Poole is something that\nfurther grips the reader as we work our\nway through the novel, finding out who\nshe really is and getting to the bottom\nof her parlous and devious nature.\nThis intricate love story\nis profoundly overwhelming yet highly complex in\nthe context of the plot.\nClearly, the attraction between Jane and Mr. Rochester is evident from the\nmoment she meets him on\nthe hill at sunset, their love\nsubsequently burgeons into\nan intrinsically passionate\ncanon.\nTo some, the ending is\nunassailably a compromised happy conclusion, whereas others would still consider it being slightly\ntragic. It\u2019s up to you how you interpret the denouement. I shall not give\nit away, but this masterpiece will have\nyou reading until you drop and get to\nthe finishing line.\nThis book is without a question a\ntimeless treasure and a captivating\npage-turner. My feelings then and now\nare still the same. Jane, for me, certainly symbolises the yearning desire for\nhappiness in all of us and the vulnerability and strength that we are prone\nto exhibit most of our lives. I\u2019ll dish\nout 9.9 out of 10, marred only by the\nintense anticipation for the reunion of\nthe predestined soul-mates.\nSusan Yu\n\n"
