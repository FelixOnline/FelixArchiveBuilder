    "content": "Another crypto... or is it?\nCentral Bank Digital Currency...\nAs we\u2019ve seen before, Central Banks conduct monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the money supply (MS) in the economy.\nBut, what do we mean by money supply? If you think about the amount of money you own, you will realise it is split between the notes and coin you have in your\npocket and the money you have deposited in your bank account. Thus, the money supply of an economy corresponds to the aggregate (i.e. the combined) amount\nof cash and deposits that its economic agents own \u2013 that is, you, other consumers, firms and the government.\n\u2018MONETARY POLICY\u2019... I\u2019M A BIT EMBARRASSED TO ASK, BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nAna In\u00eas Lajas Pereira\nWriter // Financial Senior Analyst\nWhat does a Central Bank do? What is Decentralised\nCurrency? Ana In\u00eas Lajas Pereira explains...\nFRIDAY 21ST JANUARY 2022\n21\nInvestment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Ahmad Danesh\nInvestment Investment Society\nImperial College London\nThe first thought that pops into most\npeoples\u2019 minds when they first hear\nabout Central Bank Digital Currency\n(CBDC) is that it is just another cryptocurrency, this\ntime issued by a Central Bank (CB). However, this\nidea couldn\u2019t be more wrong, as it contradicts both\nCBs\u2019s mandate of price stability and the definition of\ncrypto as a privately issued and decentralised digital\ncurrency.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a CBDC and\ncryptocurrency?\nIn most economies, we can distinguish Central\nBank Money (banknotes and reserves) from\ncommercial bank money (deposits). Deposits are\nthe prevalent type of money supply in developed\neconomies: in the UK, 97% of the money supply\ncomprises commercial bank deposits and only 3%\ncorrespond to cash. In most countries, banknotes are\nthe only form of Central Bank money accessible to\nthe general public, which would change was CBDC\nto be issued. Central Bank Digital Currency would\nwork as \u201cdigital cash\u201d, that is, CB money which\nwould be stored on our e-wallets, instead of on our\nphysical ones. This way, CBDC would not be a new\ncurrency, but essentially a digitalization of the already\nexisting banknotes. Therefore, CBDC would be\nhighly different from a cryptocurrency: a privately\nissued and decentralized digital asset. In practice, few\ncryptocurrencies have the properties of traditional\ncurrency (means of exchange, store of value and unit\nof account). They are instead traded as speculative\nassets (stablecoins, whose values are pegged to a\ncurrency such as USD, are exceptions to this), which\nmakes them unsuitable substitutes for cash and bank\ndeposits, while CBDC represents a better option,\nposing as a not flawless but considerable substitute.\nWhat\u2019s the importance of the CB\u2019s control of the\nmonetary system?\nThe critical role of Central Banks is to conduct\nmonetary policy in order to achieve price stability,\nthat is, low and stable inflation (around 2%) and\nto help manage economic fluctuations. Under a\ndeflationary scenario, agents (people who play a\npart in the economy) postpone their consumption\nand investment decisions, as purchasing power\nincreases over time, thus deterring economic growth\nand weakening financial stability. Conversely,\nhyperinflation urges consumers to spend their income\nas fast as possible, thus decreasing marginal propensity\nto save, which hurts long term economic growth.\nThis way, it\u2019s easy to understand the importance of\nlow and stable levels of inflation, which promote\nhealthy levels of consumption and investment. Central\nBanks achieve price stability through adjustments\nof the money supply: in economic booms, CBs\nconduct restrictive monetary policy, i.e., decrease\nthe money supply such that interest rates increase,\nleading consumption and investment to decrease and\ninflationary pressures to cool down. In recessions, CBs\nconduct expansionary monetary policy, promoting\nthe increase of consumption and investment. This way,\nwe see that Central Banks\u2019 ability to control money\nsupply is vital not only to maintain prices stable, but\nalso to help manage economic fluctuations.\nWhat\u2019s the benefits and risks of the introduction of\nCBDCs?\nOne of the main arguments in favour of the\nintroduction of CBDC is the risk private money\ncreation represents for the Central Banks control\nof the monetary system. If tech giants introduced\ndigital currencies capable of competing with CB\nmoney, that would significantly harm the impact of\nmonetary policy on price and economic stability.\nMeta\u2019s Diem project and the recent sizable increase in\nstablecoin supply are examples of such a threat. Other\npossible advantages of the introduction of CBDC\nare the anticipation of the CB necessity to meet the\nfuture payment needs of a digital economy and the\nforeseeable ease of cross-border payments. However,\nintroducing CBDC would raise concerns in terms of\nprivacy, as preventing criminal activity would require\nnon-anonymity in CBDC transactions; financial\ndisintermediation, as it is inevitable that some people\nwould transfer money out of their bank deposits into\nCBDC wallets, meaning that there would be less\ndeposits available for commercial banks to concede as\nloans; and creation of a centralised point of failure that\nwould be a target for hackers.\nWhat\u2019s the UK\u2019s status on CBDCs compared to the\nrest of the world?\nAlthough over 90 central banks are exploring\nCBDCs, most are still in a pure research phase. That\u2019s\nthe case of the Bank of England, which made clear that\n\u201cBritcoin\u201d is still under study and, even if the UK\u2019s CB\ndecides to advance with its creation, it\u2019s unlikely to\narrive until 2025. However, 9 countries have already\nlaunched CBDCs (7 countries in Eastern Caribbean,\nThe Bahamas and Nigeria) and 14 others, including\nChina, South Africa and Saudi Arabia, have pilot\nversions of CBDCs. You can see this with the map\nover on the next page.\nAll in all, although it is not clear whether in 5 years\u2019\ntime we will have Britcoin in our digital wallets, it is\nstill essential to understand what it is and to follow the\ndebate on what could be the next evolutionary stage of\ncentralised money.\nAna is one of the Senior Analysts at the Investment\nSociety\u2019s Capital Fund, QT Capital whilst studying MSc\nFinance at Imperial College Business School.\nWill Central Banks\u2019 Decentralised Currency really have an effect on monetary policy?\nImage credits: Unsplash\n\n"

    "content": "The National Student Survey\n(NSS) has launched at Imperial\nCollege and will run until the end of\nApril 2022 for all final year students.\nLast year\u2019s NSS garnered Imperial\nnation-wide acclaim, with a record-breaking result of 84%. This is 3%\nhigher than the previous year and came\nin a year where the score for almost\nevery other university went down.\nImperial College says that the\nsurvey will ask students about \u201careas\nsuch as academic support, learning\nresources and assessment and feedback\u201d.\nVice Provost (Education and Student\nExperience) Emma McCoy said that\nshe encourages all final year students\nto take the survey, and that \u201cIt is an\nextremely important barometer for the\nCollege of the things that we are getting\nright, but also where we can improve,\nand we take the results very seriously.\nBy taking part in the Survey you are\nshaping the Imperial experience for\nfuture students just as those who came\nbefore you shaped your own experience\u201d.\nShe added \u201cOur plans for the future\nhave adapted to, and in some cases been\nimproved by the pandemic, but they are\nno less ambitious. These improvements\nrange from campus developments,\nincluding new multi-disciplinary\nlaboratories, lecture theatre conversions\nand next-generation AV, to improved\nstudent support such as an expanded\nMental Health Advice service.\u201d\nImperial College increased its\nfunding for mental health services from\n\u00a3932,772 in the 2019/20 academic year,\nto \u00a3959,651 in the 2020/21 academic\nyear. This represents a 2.9% increase.\nThe College have clarified that McCoy\u2019s\ncomments refer to future spending, and\nthat four new roles in the Mental Health\nAdvice service have recently been filled.\nThe total mental health spend in\nthe 2018/19 academic year by the\nUniversity of Bristol, whose student\npopulation is of a similar size to\nImperial\u2019s, was \u00a31,458,544. This is\n69% higher than the amount Imperial\nCollege spent during the same time\nframe. Imperial College\u2019s revenue was\n58% greater than that of the University\nof Bristol in the 2019/20 academic year.\nLast year\u2019s record-breaking NSS\nresults at Imperial were largely put down\nto success in the transition to remote\nlearning. The NSS website specifies that\n\u201cQuestionsaboutstudents\u2019experienceof\nhigher education during the coronavirus\npandemic will not be asked in the 2022\nsurvey\u201d. Given this, it is unclear whether\nImperial\u2019s high score will be maintained.\nThe University of Oxford\u2019s student\nunion (SU) has announced a boycott of\nthe NSS for the third year in a row. They\nsay this is because \u201cthe data gathered\nfrom the NSS is used to rank universities\nagainst each other, which can create a\ncompetitive market of education\u201d and\nthat this \u201cmay encourage universities to\nstream money into quick fixes simply to\ndrive up student satisfaction on paper\u201d.\nOxford SU adds that \u201cquestions\non the NSS reflect a narrow view of\nwhat higher education and student\nexperience should look like, rather\nthan the more holistic and structural\nunderstanding Oxford SU advocates for,\nwhich includes an emphasis on equality\nand welfare as well as academics\u201d.\nThere are no mandatory welfare-based questions in the 2022 NSS.\nThere are optional questions that can\nbe selected from a \u2018question bank\u2019\nby the HE provider. If the provider\ndoes not select these questions then a\nstudent at that institution is not given\nthe option to answer them. Of the 54\nquestions in the question bank, four\nrelate to welfare and student safety.\nOtherSUstoboycotttheNSSinclude\nUniversity of Cambridge, University\nof Bath and Kings College London.\nThe National Union of Students called\nfor a boycott of the NSS in 2016.\nImperial College Union\u2019s Council\nvoted on whether to join the NSS\nboycott in the 2016/17 academic\nyear, but this idea was voted down.\nThe Union\u2019s Deputy President\n(Education), Daniel Lo, said \u201cI am\naware that a number of students\u2019 unions\nhave decided to boycott the National\nStudent\u2019s Survey (NSS). I acknowledge\ntheir concerns, and I agree that the\nNSS questions are not comprehensive\nenough to fully assess student\u2019s academic\nexperiences at the College, or their\nability to access support. However, the\nscoring and comments are valuable for\nbothdepartmentsandICUinevaluating\ntheir teaching success and lobbying\nfor improvements respectively.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n24 Sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nTalking to Melissa Hexter - strongwoman\nEdited and written by: Amanda Barden\nKonrad Hohendorf\nSport\nIn this article we catch up with one of Imperial\u2019s most\nimpressive athletes, Melissa Hexter. This isn\u2019t the\nfirst time we\u2019ve spoken to her \u2013 Melissa\u2019s impressive\nfeats of weightlifting have now graced the pages of Felix several times. Melissa recently competed in Lithuania, however, in her own words she \u201cepically failed\u201d.\nThis was Melissa\u2019s first international competition\nand while cutting for her weigh-in to compete in\nthe 57kg category, she depleted her body of salt so\nbadly that she ended up hyponatraemic and her body\nstopped functioning properly. \u201cI\u2019ve always been able\nto get away with pushing my body to the limits\u2026\nthis is the first time my body has given up on me\u201d.\nFor the first and second lift for the bench press, she\nmissed her opener. Somehow, on the third lift, she got\nit, but collapsed right after into her coach. \u201cOverall, it\nwas just really embarrassing\u2026 the sad part is if I had\ncompeted in the weight class up and lifted my PB,\nwhichIhavedoneatalowerweight,Iwouldhavewon\u201d.\nThereasonwhyMelissaattemptedtocompeteinthe57\nkg class was because she felt that she had a real chance\nof breaking the world record. However, from this\nexperience, Melissa said she learned a lot and prepared\nverydifferentlyforhernextcompetition,andtheresults\nof that competition prove her success in her training.\n\u201cI took what I learned from the competition in\nLithuania and re-evaluated how I was going to prep\nmyself nutritionally for this next competition. I used\na completely different strategy for this competition\nand it worked absolutely beautifully...\u201d. Melissa does\nall her nutritional planning on her own. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot\nof trial and error based on your personal needs\u2026 I\nthink by the European championship in Sweden I\nfound the formula\u2026 I was the strongest I have ever\nbeen in my life on that day. You want that extra 15%\nout of your body from a peak while also cutting\nweight, and I got that, which was really awesome.\u201d\nShe went on to tell us \u201cI could have lifted more\nat this competition\u2026 I left kilos on the platform.\nAnd yet, I won the gold for the total, and that\u2019s\nwhat I went to Sweden to do!\u201d. As her total for the\ncompetition, Melissa lifted an astounding 427.5kg.\nMelissa told us that she\u2019s been competing in the 57\nkg weight class since she started lifting, and during\nthat time has managed to put an impressive 120 kg\nonto her total lift while not gaining weight. However,\nthis year she\u2019s moving up to the 63 kg weight class.\n\u201cMoving up to 63kg will be a lot of work because I\nhave a lot of weight to put on\u2026 but I am really excited\nto have strengths that I never had before. Everyone\nwho I have talked to who has moved up a weight\nclass always says they wish they had done it sooner\u201d.\nMelissa\u2019s big competition for 2022 will be an invite\nonly meet called ABS Pro in Dublin. \u201cI am really\nexcited because it\u2019s different than other types of\nmeets that I usually do. I compete in the International\nPowerlifting federation, where you compete in weight\nclasses. But with the ABS Pro, all weight classes are\ncompeting against each other, but they are scored by\nsomething called the Wilks Formula, which allows you\nto compare lifters of different weights and different\nsexes as well\u2026 I am really excited to see what I can do\nagainst some of the best lifters in the world. I would\ndefinitely want to give it everything I\u2019ve got. There is\nalso a pretty extensive cash prize, and you get a Viking\nhelmet and a nice ring, so that would be kind of cool.\u201d\nMore generally, Melissa took us through her\nfavourite lift, as from our perspective, she is more than\nsuccessful in all of them. \u201cMy bench press is my best lift\nbut it is not my favourite. My favourite lift is probably\nmy deadlift, because I don\u2019t think I am as good at it,\nand because of that I have the most to improve and\nspend time on it. Given that my bench press is 110kg,\nmy deadlift at the same calibre should be 215-220,\nwhereas now it stands at 170.\u201d She went on to tell us\nwhat her goals for the ABS Pro are. \u201cI would really\nlike to squat around 190kg. I think 120kg bench is\ndefinitely attainable. With the deadlift, it depends on\nhow much I can optimize my technique, so I would\nwant to lift 190kg. That would put me at 500kg total\u201d.\nMelissa also told us why she chose powerlifting. \u201cIt\u2019s\nvery black and white, you put the work in and you\nsee outcomes on the bar. As a scientist, I really like it,\nbecause everything you put into it has a measurable\nresponse\u201d. On top of her incredibly busy schedule\nof powerlifting and completing her PhD, Melissa\nhas also taken on the role as a GTA this year. \u201cI get\nto meet and teach these students that are absolutely\nwonderful. I get to learn something new every time.\nIt can be really stressful, particularly when students\nare hard on themselves, which happens a lot of the\ntime, especially at Imperial. Kids tend to be really\nhard on themselves, and they are a lot more prone\nto having mental breakdowns\u2026 to get to a place\nlike Imperial, you have to have the self-motivation\nand the grit, and you have to work really hard.\u201d\nHer advice to Imperial students: \u201cImperial kids, stop\nbeing hard on yourselves. Give yourself more credit.\nIt\u2019ll all be fine\u201d. I think I can speak for all of us when\nI say Melissa schedule appears incredibly busy, and\nshe is very successful in managing it all. She says her\nsupportsystemhelpsherthroughallherbusyschedule,\nmaking it easier for her to perform at the level she is\nat, in all aspects of her life. \u201cI am really lucky I do\nhave a really good support system. I have some really\nlovely friends in my lab, and I have a pretty strong\nfriend group in my departments, and an amazing\nhusband. My husband also powerlifts, and he\u2019s also a\nsoftware engineer, so he also has the scientist mindset\nand he understands. He gets the little things, like my\ncaloric needs. I\u2019m not a normal person, like when I am\ntraining heavily, I eat every three hours. But he gets it.\u201d\nMelissa Hexter is one of the most impressive athletes\nwe have met, as well as being a successful scientist,\nand she will, without a doubt, be an excellent GTA.\nWe are looking forward to publishing more articles\nabout her successes in the powerlifting world. Even\nthough you don\u2019t need it, best of luck in the ABS\nPro this year Melissa! We\u2019ll all be rooting for you!\n\n"

The able hand\nof new-age experimental artist OPN can be heard\nacross the album, most notably\non \u2018Gasoline\u2019, where the exquisite\ninstrumentation sounds like\nsomething straight out of Blade\nRunner. The half-spoken, half-sung sections on this track have\nreceived flak from some critics,\nbut they have grown on me\nwith each listen. They contrast\nstrikingly with the silky-smooth\nsinging elsewhere and fit well\nwith the electronic sound of the\ntrack, and existential motifs of\nthe wider album.\nLyrically, the trademark\nhedonism that has become a\nhallmark of The Weeknd\u2019s work is still very much\nthere. However, the new album follows in the vein of\nAfter Hours in that it features less prominently than\nit did in his earlier work, taking a back seat to the\nbursting, indulgent soundscapes.\nThere are two spoken-word tracks on Dawn FM:\n\u2018A Tale by Quincy\u2019 is a piece by music legend Quincy\nJones, who reflects on his upbringing, and \u2018Phantom\nRegret by Jim\u2019 concludes the album, with Jim Carrey\nmusing on the themes of purgatory and death\npresent throughout. Both are welcome inclusions,\nand in addition to what they bring in terms of lyrical\nsubstance, they serve to pace the\nalbum.\nA mention must be given to\none of the features on Dawn FM.\n\u2018HereWeGo\u2026Again\u2019isoneofthe\nhighlights of the album, and sees\nTesfaye teaming up with Tyler,\nthe Creator. It sounds exactly like\nwhat I\u2019d expect a Weeknd-Tyler\ncollab to sound like \u2013 which is a\ncompliment.Thesoaringdelivery\nof Tesfaye relaxes into the unique\npsychedelia-tinged sweetness\nwhich Tyler has become known\nfor, with sumptuous results.\nWhat this album does so well\nis to combine the myriad strands and influences into\na cohesive package. The eclectic tastes and sounds of\nits producers come together to produce something\ngreater than the sum of its parts. Like its predecessor,\nDawn FM demands listening to from start to finish,\nas an album, rather than a disparate collection of hits.\nIt pushes the boundaries of what a modern-day pop\nalbum can be and cements the Weeknd\u2019s status as one\nof the genre\u2019s greats.\n19\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Rosie Millns\nTara Pal Chaudhuri\nMusic\nDon\u2019t miss the gig -Yard Act @ 100 Club,\n22nd January\nIf you aren\u2019t\nbored of post-punk yet, Leeds\nquartet Yard\nAct are for you.\nFeaturing on\nBBC\u2019s Sound of\n2022 list, these\nare not a group to miss!

    "content": "FRIDAY 21ST JANUARY 2022\n3\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nIn the embryonic development of\nvertebrates, a tiny single cell called a\nzygote, which comes from the fusion of\nan ovule and a sperm cell, starts dividing\nmany times in order to form an embryo.\nThis is faced with the challenge not only\nof forming specialised cells like nerves,\nbut also the obligation to allocate these\nspecialised cells in the correct position\nbecause they will form tissues, and from\ntissues form organs. So you do not want\nthem to be misplaced, or the survival of\nthe organism could be compromised!\nThose responsible for this huge\ncommitment are some transcription\nfactors (TFs) encoded by Hox genes.\nTFs are proteins that bind to\nsequences of DNA that code for\nproteins. Transcription factors can\nactivate or inhibit their activity nd in\nthis way regulate transcription. This\nis a cellular process that uses a specific\nsequence of DNA to synthesize a\nmolecule of messenger RNA (mRNA).\nThe mRNA is a single-strand nucleic\nacid that associates with ribosomes, a\ncell organelle that, using the genetic\ninformation contained in the mRNA,\ncan start joining amino acids together\nto form proteins. This process is termed\ntranslation. Proteins are the building\nblocks of life because they enable\nessential chemical reactions and also\nform part of cell structures such as the\ncytoskeleton or the cell membrane.\nHowever, if transcription factors\nregulate gene expression, what regulates\ntranscription factors? Rather than\ncontrolling TFs directly, what is actually\nregulated are the genes that codify these\nTFs. The switching of TF genes ON/\nOFF ultimately depends on external\nstimuli like a change in the levels of\noxygen. This is to say, TF genes are\noften regulated by other TFs, in a sort\nof cascade. One TF activates another,\nand so on. This phenomenon is called\namplification. But the TF genes at\nthe top of these cascades have the first\nword. This is why they\u2019re called master\nregulators.\nIn the 1950s, scientists conducted\na screening of the homeotic\ntransformations (or developmental\nabnormalities) in Drosophila (fruit\nflies). E.B. Lewis mapped the mutations\nresponsible for these homeotic\ntransformations in 1978. One of his\nfindings was that the mutated genes act\nin a combinational way like a code, the\nHox code. Two groups of Hox genes\nin chromosome 3 of Drosophila were\ndiscovered. Although located physically\nin different locations in chromosome\n3, scientists referred to them as a single\nidentity called the Hox cluster. What\nwas really surprising is that the Hox\ngenes closer to the extreme 3\u2019 of DNA\nact on the most-anterior body parts,\nand those at the 5\u2019 end act on the most-posterior body parts. There is spatial\ncollinearity between the gene location\nand the development of a body part in a\nparticular location.\nHox genes regulate each other. For\nexample, in Drosophila, if the Hox gene\nUbx is ON while the rest of them are\nOFF, halteres (\u2018wings\u2019) are formed in the\nthird thoracic segment (T3). A bithorax\nmutation causes the Ubx to interpret the\nsecond thoracic segment (T2) as T3 too.\nConsequently, the mutated Drosophila\nhas four halteres instead of two.\nW.J. Gehring discovered a\nconserved short DNA sequence: the\nhomeobox. This contains the genetic\ninformation necessary to synthesise\na chain of 60-amino acids called a\nhomeodomain. The homeobox is a\nhighly conserved stretch of genes that\ncontain the Hox genes. It encodes a\ndomain for transcription factors that is\nable to bind to specific DNA equences\nin order to regulate developmental\nprocesses. It is highly conserved in\nvertebrates, meaning you\u2019ll share the\nsame homeobox as the birds, toads, or\nmammals around you.\nSynpolydactyly is a rare genetic\ndisease caused by a mutation of the\nHOX13 gene. It was the first disease\ndiagnosed to be associated with Hox\ngenes. The symptoms of synpolydactyly\nare limb malformations. These can be\nsyndactyly, joint fingers, or polydactyly,\nextra fingers. The treatment is surgery to\nseparate or remove fingers.\nEven small molecules like those\nencoded by Hox genes can determine\nbig changes in the organism. These genes\nare interconnected and highly regulated,\nso the impacts of these molecules do not\ndepend on their quanitity, but where\nthey are expressed along the cascade of\ntranscription factors.\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nSmall things can make big changes, depending on where they are\u2026\nTranscription factors, Hox genes and a six-finger hand\nEdited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nRayan Kamal\nScience\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons (Drgnu23), CC BY-SA 3.0\nHox gene collinearity: the order of the genes in the Hox cluster is the same as their expression\npattern along the anterior-posterior axis of the body\nCredit: Antonio Quesada D\u00edaz, public domain\nThe six-fingered hand of someone with polydactyly\n\n"

This\namounts to a trip from London\nto Newcastle and back, with a few\nkilometres to spare. It\u2019s a massive leap\nfrom current standards\u2014according to\nNewMotion, the average range of a fully\nelectric car as of today is around 291\nkilometres, less than a third of what the\nEQXX boasts.\nThe Vision EQXX\u2019s boundary-defying efficiency is due to the\nengineering of a new lithium-ion\nbattery that uses 95% of its energy\ninto turning the car\u2019s wheels and is\nreportedly 30% lighter than current\nbatteries with similar capacities. It\nwas developed in collaboration with\nspecialists from other institutions, such\nas Formula 1 and Formula E engineers.\nThe design of the EQXX also aims\nto achieve exceptional aerodynamic\nefficiency\u2014it has a drag coefficient\nof 0.17, exceeding previous Mercedes\nEV models. The drag coefficient is\nimportant because it defines how\nmuch energy goes into countering air\nresistance\u2014two-thirds of the electrical\nenergy that cars consume is taken up\nwith this job. EQXX\u2019s roof is also lined\nwith solar panels that the Mercedes\nBenz website says will allow for 25 extra\nkilometres on a day with ideal weather\nconditions.\nThe EQXX also hones in on\nsourcing the automobile\u2019s components\nsustainably\u2014the body of the car makes\nuse of low carbon, flat steel that is\nentirely made up of scrap metal. The\nnoise-insulating material inside the\nEV\u2019s structural legs is provided by\nUBQ Materials, a cleantech company\nthat turns household waste into\nthermoplastics. In this specific instance,\nthe material is made in part from\nused nappies, of which eight million\nare disposed of in landfills each day\nin the UK. The interior is just as eco-conscious, with bamboo carpets, faux\nleather seat covers that use cactus leaf\nfibres, door pulls clothed with manmade silk (which is much more eco-friendly than natural silk), and recycled\nPET plastic panels. Mercedes-Benz\nclaims that this change from animal\nto vegan leather halves its carbon\nfootprint.\nThe electric vehicle industry will see\nrapid growth in the coming decade\u2014a\nnew study from the Platform for\nElectromobility has predicted that\nEV sales in Europe will overtake\ntraditionally fuelled cars in three years.\nAlthough the Vision EQXX is only a\nprototype\u2014it is not a model that will\ngo into production and will most likely\nnever be seen on the streets\u2014Mercedes\nputs itself at the forefront of prioritising\nsustainability, and future models will\ndraw on the design and technology of\nthis concept car.\nFRIDAY 21ST JANUARY 2022\n11\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT\nVision EQXX: a hyper-efficient EV prototype\nMarie Mori Environment Editor\ndrive change. These steps are certainly\nmeaningful in the context of climate\nchange. The issue, however, arises when\nwe take a step back and ask ourselves\nwhy. Most basal information for such\nactivism stems from reaching specific\ngoals within a sensitive period. Activists\nshould stop and think: how do we\nunderstand the science behind these\ngoals? Who makes these goals? What\nkind of knowledge is derived from these\ngoals? What exactly do we know for\nsure?\nNow, there\u2019s already a school of\nphilosophers that focus on just that.\nThey call themselves epistemologists\u2014\npeople who think about why, what, and\nhow we think. Scoping into the climate\nproblem, we can begin to wonder why\nwe think about climate issues the way\nwe do. Personally speaking, this is\nrelatively unexplored territory.\nOur propensity to understand the\nseverity of the problem, however,\nhas been driven primarily by public\ninformation. Most people learn about\nclimate risks through news-like sources\nand word-of-mouth. As a result, the\nillustration of climate change as a\nconcern has been repeatedly controlled\nby non-academic actors. Undoubtedly,\nwe have learned valuable information\nthrough this practice and continue to\nlearn more every day; however, have we\nstopped to think about why we know\nthings the way we do?\nProf. Hulme\u2019s message is incredibly\nlike that of an activist; it just differs in\napproach and methodology. Regardless\nof what you might think about Prof.\nHulme\u2019s opinion on climate activism, he\ndoes relay a message worth considering:\nwhen we invest our passion into\nclimate, how well equipped are we to\nunderstand the incredible sensitivities\nof social impacts within. Knowing\nwhat we know might not be enough.\nThere is a need for an even more\ncritical response to knowledge around\nus. We should not take things at face\nvalue because sometimes they might\nhave influences surrounding them. If\nanything, I hope that you contemplate\nwhat truly knowing about this issue\nmeans because, frankly, I still don\u2019t.\nIllustrations by Karolina Wilgus\n\n"

Written by her friend and colleague Alan Plater\nand running since 1999, Peggy For You powerfully encapsulates a day in Peggy\u2019s life, with all its chaos, com-edy, and absurdity.\nPlacing emphasis on Peggy\u2019s passion for her work,\nthe entire plot unravels in the setting of her office.\nRichard Wilson, director of the play, expertly manages to transport the audience into the quaint world of\nendless stacks of play scripts, clicking typewriters, and\ndeep-thinking dramatists. As the curtains draw apart,\nwe see Peggy lying on a chaise lounge in the middle of\nthe office in the dead of night. She is making a ridiculously early call to her client, criticising their play rudely and without hesitation, calling them \u2018darling\u2019, and\ntelling a story with absolutely no regard for her client\u2019s\ninterest in the tale.\nHer comically outrageous behaviour immediately left me with a smile and admiration for her wit. As\nthe day progresses, she engages in humorous exchanges with her secretary, whose name she can\u2019t seem to\nremember, and three dramatists at different stages of\ntheir careers. She first speaks to a potential golden boy\nSimon (Josh Finan), whose name she can\u2019t remember\neither, wittily discussing the question \u2018What is a play?\u2019;\nthen, to a dramatist at the peak of his success, Philip\n(Jos Vantyler), whom she tries to persuade to call off\nhis marriage that she sees as merely a distraction from\nhis work.\nAs the play draws to a close, she shares a touching\nconversation with an old dramatist Henry (Trevor\nFox) heading towards the end of his career. The exchange exposes a deeper side of her character, beautifully tying together the puzzle pieces of her remarkable\npersonality.\nAlthough I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere\nand humour of the play, I sometimes felt that the plot\nlacked a sense of suspense and drama. For an international student like me, it is worth mentioning that the\nmany references to other British and American plays\ncan sometimes obscure the meaning for those unfamiliar with these works.

Our research\nshows that 43% of people, when they get their food\nwill saying something along the lines of \u2018Thank God,\nI am starving\u2019. This is the next frontier in ensuring\nstudents have the most conducive environment to\nlearn in\u201d. The letter was also based on a 2019 paper by\nDr Invagen, an Imperial researcher studying nutrition\nin undergraduate model organisms. The paper\nreported that \u201cthe average nutritional content of an\nundergraduate meal was 12 calories\u201d or slightly higher\nthan a piece of A3 paper and slightly lower than five\nlicks of the keyboards in the JMC computer labs.\nWhen consulted, Dr Invagen told NegaFelix that he\nstill doesn\u2019t really know how undergraduates survive\nand is currently seeking funding from the Bill and\nMelinda Gates Foundation in order to seek real world\napplications for his findings.\nAn early trial of the scheme produced mixed results\nafter large amounts of waste were produced as a\nresult of students eschewing the free food in favour\nof queuing for Kimiko. Left Forum declared victory,\nhowever, after finding that many academics and post-grads were going through the bins and taking the left\novers home with them.\nWhen queried about what they thought of the\nplan, third year Mech Eng student, Feb Senton said\nthat while he appreciated the idea he would not take\nadvantage of the opportunity. \u201cI have had such a bad\ndiet now for such a long time that I can now only eat\npartially defrosted ready meals.

    "content": "The work of Mamoru Hosoda\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n18\nFilm Review\nWolf Children\nDirectedby: Mamoru Hosoda\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nWolf Children (2012) tells the story of Hana,\nlonely university student in Tokyo who met a\nmysterious man and fell in love with him. After some\ntime, the mysterious man reveals to Hana that he is a\nwerewolf, and instead of running away, Hana accepts\nhis condition and they have two children together\ncalled Yuki and Ame (both werewolves). The father\nsuddenly dies while hunting food for their children,\nwhich leaves Hana to raise two werewolves on her own,\nwith no guide. Not surprisingly, the problems did not\nwait to arrive: Hana could not take them to any public space like a park to play as they were changing to\ntheir werewolf state. Because of this stressful situation,\nshe decided to move with her children to a rural area,\nwhere she learned how to make a living. In parallel,\nYuki and Ame were growing: Ame was initially the\nweakest of the siblings, but he gained more self-con-fidence. On the other hand, when Yuki was a kid, she\nwas impulsive and had a hobby of collecting insects,\nbut she started worrying more about her appearance\nand fitting into a group after going to school. However,\nthe desires and objectives of the children are constantly\nfluctuating and there are unexpected decisions. At the\nend, Yuki and Ame must decide whether they prefer\nliving as humans or as wolfs.\nThe supernatural element of the werewolves is\nsurprising when revealed, but it is after relegated to\na second plane because the film is focused on the\nrelationships between character and their psyche.\nIndeed,thewerewolfchildrenwereanallegoryofthe\ncrisis of identity that everyone undergoes throughout\ntheir lives. Yuki and Ame would find out that many\nactivities they enjoyed as children were not enjoyable\nanymore and vice versa when they became teenagers.\nHana is the model of the resilient mother who\nworked hard and learned from her mistakes to\nguarantee that the needs of her children were satisfied.\nThe scenes of her working while taking care of her\nchildrenareinspiringandincentiviseustoreflectonthe\nunconditionalloveandsupportourmothersgavetous.\nIn the last part of the film, Hana showed an incredible\nwillingness to allow their children to decide their own\ndestiny, whether living as wolves or as humans, with\nthe important sacrifice that she would never see them\nagain. Hana, in short words, is an exaltation to all the\nmother of the world that impulse their children to find\ntheir own path in life, which is the only that can bring\nthem true happiness.\nAnother detail is the tribute to the rural life: when\nHana lived in the city, no one supported her, and she\nwasoneofthemillionsof Tokyocitizenslivinginthose\nliving blocks. The alienation of the character in the city\nwas contrasted with her new life in the countryside.\nNot only did she gain an identity and position in that\nsmall community, but she also renovated an old and\ndirty cottage to a comfortable one, symbolising the\ntransition of the family to a better life with Hana as the\nengine of it.\nThe period of the films starts from the birth of the\nchildren to their complete maturity, we could witness\na complete evolution of the characters physically and\npsychologically, making the characters seem more\nreal and plausible. This organic development of\nthe characters causes the emotional intensity in the\ndrama scenes more heart touching and meaningful.\nThe animation is simple, not detailed in the shadows\nor the contours, in exchange for more fluidity in the\nbody movements and face expressions - wise choice\nconsidering the main theme of Wolf Children: family.\nThe general pace of the film is slow, the music and the\ndialogues are not over exaggerated, focusing on being\nas realistic as possible. However, the naturality of the\nrelationships between character and the development\nof these did not bore the audience at any point.\nOverall, Wolf Children is a nice contrast to all the\nNetflix films saturated of action and death. It is also\na film to remind us to be grateful to our parents, who\ngave us everything we have.\nBelle\nDirectedby: Mamoru Hosoda\nNew Film Release\nBelle is the 6th film by director Mamoru Hosoda\nand is loosely inspired by \u00abThe Beauty and the\nBeast \u00bb. If you feel like you already know the story,\nfear not, it is vastly different from the original fairy\ntale.\nNow what is the premise? The meek Suzu has been\nunable to sing since a tragic event. But when she joined\nthe virtual world of U, she finds her voice back and\nbecomes the most famous singer of the platform, Belle.\nThere, she meets \u00abThe Beast \u00bb.\nThe film tackles the difficult subjects of grief and\nabuse but also teenagers\u2019 awkward first love and\nstanding up for yourself and others. One can argue that\nthe movie is too simple when it comes to solving real-world problems but on the other hand it fits the overall\nsoft and positive atmosphere.\nAnother important theme is the Internet, presented\nthrough the virtual world U. While Mamoru Hosoda\nacknowledges issues such as cyber bullying, the world\nof U is a positive depiction of the Internet. It connects\npeople and encourages them to care for others.\nSimilarly, it is also where Belle first finds the courage to\nbuild her confidence back up.\nVisually, it is a feast for the eyes. The world of U is\nvibrant with colours, the design of Belle and the Beast is\nstunning, and the animation is smooth. It is definitely\nworth seeing on a big screen!\nThe songs included in Belle are absolutely beautiful.\nYoudonotevenneedtoreadthesubtitlestoappreciate\nthem. Belle\u2019s voice actor, Kaho Nakamura, has done an\namazing job and if you want to check one of the movie\nsongs, I invite you to search for \u00ab Gales of sound \u00bb.\nIf you are familiar with Hosoda\u2019s works you might\nfind some similarities especially with Summer Wars.\nFor example, both movies have half of their actions\nhappening in a colourful virtual world while the other\nhalf is more of a family and friends\u2019 drama. However, it\nwould be a mistake to think that if you have seen one\nno need to see the other. Both have their own plot and\nI encourage you to check them out.\nNext time you want to go to the cinema but don\u2019t\nknow what to see, don\u2019t forget about beautiful Belle!\nAur\u00e9lia Bordes Film Writer\nFILM\n\n"

Wireless communication devices equipped with technology such as\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are able to perform with very limited, but\ncontinuous, power. This power could be provided by indoor lighting, but\nthis has so far been limited as solar cells typically capture much brighter\nsunlight at a different emission spectrum. However, organic photovoltaics with a bilayer have been found to be well-matched to indoor light\nconditions and can suppress issues of trap-assisted recombination.

    "content": "action, the relevance of politics in\nclimate, the IPCC, climate goals, and\nmoral coercion. Below, I will attempt\nto summarize his opinions (if not\nclear, I am more than happy to share\na transcript of the conversation with\nanyone interested).\nIn the opinion of Prof. Hulme, the\nrole of the global climate narrative is far\nmore political than it is scientific. He\nbelieves it is \u201cinevitable that political\nactors would begin to influence global\nconversations to forward their own\ngoals\u201d. This, according to Prof. Hulme,\nstems from the preponderance of youth\nwho \u201cover-simplify\u201d the role of climate.\nHe suggests that \u201csetting global targets\nis easy but not productive. They do\nnot account for economic and moral\nsynergies and can often create a culture\nof militantism\u201d. He believes that the\nrecent COP 26 in Glasgow is just an\nevent where leaders morally coerced\na narrative of climate justice using\nmarketable instances such as a leader\nholding a photo of their grandchild to\npush climate justice.\nProf. Hulme highlighted a culture of\n\u201cnudging\u201d in which governments and\ninternational bodies can manipulate\nthe behaviours of the public for a\ncertain objective. He believes that\nglobal temperature or emission goals do\nnot have to be followed to the degree\nor ton respectively. He argues for a\nrationalist approach in which the path\ntaken to emissions is questioned and\nmodified rather than an insistence to\nremain coherent to a specific target.\nThis, according to Prof. Hulme, evokes\na cultural change in climatology rather\nthan a race towards a hyper-specific\nachievement.\nHe highlighted the mechanism in\nwhich the IPCC does not set goals but\nis influenced to derive goals based on\npolitical narratives. He suggested that\ncreating convenient temperature and\ncarbon goals is an oversimplification\nof a much more complicated issue.\n\u201cThe suggestion that climate stability\ncan be fixed by meeting an absolute\ntemperature level is not accurate,\u201d said\nProf. Hulme. He also suggested that\nthere are many engineering solutions\nthat are applicable to contribute\ntowards better climate management;\nhowever, those are not promulgated\nas much because of the same political\ninfluences mentioned above.\nProf. Hulme is one of the few voices\nin climate academia who has boldly\nstood against the current global climate\nnarrative. He has already received\ncriticism for holding opinions that\nare not coherent with the consensus.\nBefore I share my opinion, I would like\nto acknowledge that he should have the\nright to share his perspective; whether it\nis popular or not is secondary. I would\nalso like to reiterate that he is not a\nclimate-sceptic- he is far from it. He has\na disagreement in the framework we\nshould adopt but otherwise is still adept\nwith the science around climatology.\nThat being said, I do have a different\nstance.\nI think his opinion on climate\nextremism and the potential for\nmanipulation is fair. There are instances\nin the past where governments have\npushed for dogmatic conversations\nto pursue financial and/or strategic\nbenefits. This is particularly true during\ntimes of war. Prof. Hulme raises an\ninteresting point on how youth today\nmight not realize the intricacies of\nclimate change but only have a surface\nlevel understanding based on the goals\nthat are pushed by the media. These\ngoals and indicators become the sole\nbasis for their activism and contribute\nto their interpersonal choices. It might\nbe worth considering how exactly these\ngoals are derived and what their true\nmeaning is (more on this later).\nAt the same time, I do feel that Prof.\nHulme\u2019s perspective on climate activists\nassumes a hyper-stratum of activists,\nwho might share more extreme views\nthan the average individual. This leads\nto an Orwellian perception of climate\naction in which governance may appear\nmore tyrannical and totalitarian than\nit is. I think that setting a global target\nis not a wild proposition; in fact,\nProf. Hulme himself commended\nthe Paris agreement when he referred\nto it as having \u201ca positive approach\nfor bottom-up management of key\nclimate variables\u201d. Debate on the\nimplementation of such policies and\nthe realistic demand from different\ncountries is certainly on the table.\nFor youth (like myself), this leads\nto a greater call for self-introspection;\nrampant activism exists with\ntremendous promise for change and\ncan often contribute to a feeling of\naccomplishment. Quite often, attending\na climate protest or being involved\nin a dialogue with authority helps\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n10 Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT Photo credits: Miguel \u00c1.

I could hardly\nbelieve it when I found myself skipping a lecture to see\nthe revival of David McVicar\u2019s production of Mozart\u2019s\nThe Marriage of Figaro at\nthe Royal Opera House.\nAs Fredrich Nietzsche once\nwrote: \u201cLive Dangerously.\u201d\nBut I\u2019m glad I did.\nMcVicar\u2019s Figaro is a musical cocktail, one-part sultry\nSpanish allure, one-part\ncharming wit, shaken with\na healthy dose of heartfelt\npassion for one of Mozart\u2019s\nmost celebrated works.\nWith Sir Anthony Pappano, the Royal Opera House\u2019s\nmusical director, at the helm conducting and playing\nthe fortepiano, Mozart\u2019s swirling score and Da Ponte\u2019s\npoetic libretto are as vibrant and emotive as ever. The\nresult is three hours of gorgeously detailed period cos-tumes, a beautifully ornate set that evokes a lazy midsummer haze, and an international cast that bring a\nwealth of talent to the stage.\nRiccardo Fassi as Figaro effervesces with a boyish buzz whose shrewd scheming is brought to life\nalongside his equally mischievous bride Susanna (Gi-ulia Semenzato). They are perfectly suited to bounce\noff of each other; giving the production a bewitching\nwarmthfromtheoutset.WhilstFassi\u2019svocalsaresometimes lost in the bustle, Semenzato\u2019s strength as a singer shines through. She is also able to shed light on the\nmore melancholic side of the opera through with her\ninteractions with her graceful\nmistress \u2014 Countess Rosina Almaviva, whose philandering husband\u2013Count Almaviva\u2013plans to sleep with\nSusanna. Their rendition\nof \u201cSull\u2019aria...che soave zeffiretto\u201d (\u201cOn the breeze...\nWhat a gentle little Zephyr\u201d)\nwas a particularly poignant\nhighlight.

Alc\u00e1ntara\u2019s devilishly delightful\nCount begs his wife for forgiveness.\nPerhaps the greatest performance is that of Sir Anthony Pappano. The Royal Opera House\u2019s musical director is in his element conducting an orchestra who\ncollectively capture the emotional heart of Mozart\u2019s\nmusic. With his direction, they balance the comic vivacity and the soul stirring sentimentality that comes\nwith the trials and tribulations of love. The Marriage\nof Figaro\u2019s combination of farce and emotional depth\nreally does give it universal appeal; this production in\nparticular, almost 7 years old, is perfect for both experienced opera aficionados and newcomers wanting to\ndip their toes into a new art form. What better place to\nstart than an opera that celebrates love, that most fickle\nand amorphous of human experiences?\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning The Royal Opera House\u2019s\nunder-25 scheme, where anyone under 25 can access\n\u00a325 tickets for performances.

    "content": "Climate action today singularly\nrelies on the principle that present\nactions map onto a burden faced by\nsubsequent generations. This centralizes\na variety of socioeconomic and political\nchanges that we welcome (most of the\ntime).\nWe have supported our best thinkers\nto work relentlessly on deriving\nknowledge that points us towards\nanswers on the cesspool of information\nthat is our environment. Collectively,\nwe have pushed on viably studying\nthe links between nature and our\nactions. There is an irrefutable body of\nevidence to show that climate risks are\ndisproportionately anthropogenic. In\nthe new age of information, our ability\nto examine data has been productive - it\ndrives a mode of apprehension. Within\nneomodern climate action, we have seen\nthe rise of the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC) as the aegis\nof truth.\nMore recently, the IPCC has become\na celebrity of science- releasing seismic\npublications one after the other in\nthe last two decades. The IPCC has\nendorsed, if not been the driver, of\nglobal collective action, which has\nbecome popularized through target-based superlatives such as \u201cnet-zero\u201d,\n\u201c1.5/2C\u201d, \u201cCarbon-neutral\u201d, and\nothers. Eventually, these terms have\nsat well on the tongues of most of the\neducated world, particularly on those\nof politicians, academics, and corporate\nleaders. While the setting of global\nenvironmental targets has historically\nbeen shown to work (The ozone-hole\nresolution in Montreal), we certainly\nhave met a new wave of change- much\nbigger and much stronger. A force\nunlike anything from the past; a new\ndefinition of awareness and drive.\nThis seems to be a positive manifesto\nfor combatting climate change, given\nthat most of the above goals are\ntime-dependent. Unfortunately, this\nwouldn\u2019t be an article if it didn\u2019t present\na different side of things.\nI recently attended a talk by Prof.\nMike Hulme of Cambridge University.\nProf. Hulme is a climate academic who\nhas dedicated his life to examining\nthe evidence surrounding climate\nchange and published journals and\nbooks on the social domain of climate\nscience and engineering solutions for\nclimate (quite literally). The title of this\npresentation was \u201c(Beyond) Scientific\nRationality and the illusion of Climate\nGovernance\u201d. Upon reading the title,\nmy immediate impression was that the\ntalk would highlight a lack of climate\nactivism post COP26 and suggest\nthat the current regime of climate\ncommanders is not doing enough. I was,\nhowever, met with a surprise.\nProf. Hulme presented an\nargument for why the current set of\nintergovernmental goals for driving\nclimate change globally is flawed. He\nsuggested the inclusion of political\nactors as an impedance towards\nunderstanding the nuances of climate\nchange. He also indicated that the\naforementioned global targets were\npolitical tools rather than evidence-based structures. His thoughts also\nsurrounded the idea of radicals using\nmoral coercion to suggest that a carbon\nheavier action is inherently more\ndevious than one of lesser carbon.\nIt is easy to immediately judge Prof.\nHulme\u2019s perspective (as I did myself):\nhe might seem like someone who is\nagainst climate progressiveness and\nhas antiquated views on how to handle\nthis pernicious crisis. This, however,\nis abated if you re-examine what he is\nsaying. His purview on climatology\nsuggests more complexities in this\nproblem than we might think. I want\nto clarify here; I am not endorsing or\ncondemning his view. Instead, I am\ninforming you of the existence of this\ndifferent view on climate action. To\nbetter understand his perspective, I\ndecided to speak to him directly.\nIn my conversation, I attempted\nto clarify the caricature he created\nsurrounding global climate politics.\nWe discussed the implications of social\nFRIDAY 21ST JANUARY 2022\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT\n9\nThe curious case of climate activism\nPranjal Mathur Environment Writer\nPhoto credits: Nothing Ahead from Pexels\nfind, one study suggested that 30%\nof all new investors in 2016 were\nuniversity students, and with the\ninfluence of the pandemic, I think\nthat proportion may have significantly\ngrown over the last couple of years.\nThis means that together as students,\nwe not only have the capacity to make\nsignificant investments in sustainable\nenterprises and technologies but also\nthe power to send strong signals to\nfinancial institutions that may influence\nthem into making more sustainable\ninvestment decisions too.\nThis year, why not explore investing\nin stocks if you haven\u2019t already, or if you\nalready do, take a look at your portfolio\nand consider how you would feel if your\ninvestments were reflected by one of the\nbig investment funds - and whether or\nnot you should make some changes.\n9. Use your power as a citizen to\ninfluence policies with environmental\nimpacts\nStudent turnout rates for elections\nhave varied massively over time, but the\nmost recent estimate suggests that 70%\nof all students would likely vote in an\nimmediate general election in the UK.\nThis reflects how politically engaged we\nare and shows just how important it is\nthat we take the initiative to vote for the\nmost environmentally-friendly policies\nwithout being swayed too much by the\nidea of tactical voting.\nEvery election, the results of the\nso-called \u201cstudent vote\u201d are widely\nreported, suggesting that media outlets\npay great attention to the political\nwill of the younger generation, and\ntherefore political parties are likely to\nfactor it into policy decisions too.\n10. Buy renewable energy\nSimilarly to investment habits, who\nyou choose to purchase your energy\nfrom can help to send a signal to large\nenergy providers that the younger\ngeneration of householders demand\nclean energy, and they demand it sooner\nrather than later. By purchasing your\nenergy from one of a swathe of green\nenergy companies, you will be helping\nthem grow, and so green energy will be\ntaken more and more seriously by the\nindustry giants.\nSo there we go; these are ten\nsuggestions for actions you can take\nthis term to help reduce your personal\ncarbon impact and signal to those with\ninfluence that the next generation\nof leaders demands a tougher stance\non the climate emergency than their\ncurrent offering.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n4\nActivenoisecancelling-anecessity\nor luxury?\nTech Editor Rayan Kamal discusses active noise cancelling\nActive noise cancellation has become\nincreasingly popular in the wireless\naudio market. Technology companies\nhave taken advantage of this shift in the\nmarket by releasing both headphones\nand earbuds with Active Noise Cancelling (ANC). Take Sony, who have\nreleased the WH-1000XM4s head-phones, and also the WF-1000XM4\nwireless earbuds. Both of these cost\nupwards of \u00a3200, almost double what\n\u201cnormal\u201d wireless earbuds and headphones cost. So, are there any advantages of ANC, or are tech companies just\ntaking advantage of the current hype to\ncharge double and increase their profit?\nLet\u2019s begin by understanding what\nANC is and how it actually works.\nANC uses the speakers in a device to\nreduce the amount of background noise\nheard. In doing so, it allows users to experience just the music or podcast that\nthey are listening to, without being interrupted by the drone of everyday life.\nTo get into the nitty-gritty of it, ANC\nuses microphones that constantly listen\nto the surroundings. The ANC system\ninside the headphones record the sound\nwaves that are produced by the listener\u2019s\nbackground. The headphones then create their own sound wave which is in an-tiphase \u2013 i.e., a\nmirror image of\nthe original wave.\nIn doing so, the\nunwanted back-groundnoiseiscan-celled out (destruc-tive interference).\nAll headphones\nalready have a type\nof noise isolation\nthat some may not\nbe aware of \u2013 passive noise cancel-ling. This is just the\nearbuds creating\na seal in your ear\ncanal to physically block out the\nnoise. It is important to note that\nthe quality of the\nmusic outputted\ndoes not improve,\nthough this might\nseem the case.\nRather, the distractions that may have\nbeen present have now been removed.\nSo back to the original question, a\nnecessity or luxury? ANC is incredible\nfor commuting. It excels in this area, due\nto the low frequency sound produced\nduring travel - take the humming of aeroplanes or trains. In fact, ANC works\nwell at blocking out noise even without\nmusic playing \u2013 it\u2019s a great way to get\nsome sleep on a noisy tube journey. Taking this further, it can actually prevent\nhearing loss (hear me out). How many\ntimes have you travelled in the tube and\nnot been able to listen to hear your music over the cacophony of sound? How\nmanytimeshaveyouthenhadtoincrease\nthe volume up to max or close to max?\nThis level of noise can be quite damaging\nto your ears: listening to sounds of 90\ndecibels and above for long periods of\ntime is shown to have adverse effects on\nour ears. This is where active noise cancelling comes into its own, allowing you\nto comfortably listen to music at lower\nvolumes, saving your ears for the future.\nThere are some drawbacks to owning\na device with ANC, the main one being\nsafety. There can be a reduction in situa-tionalawarenessonthestreetsandroads,\ntotheextremewherepeoplehavebeenhit\nby motor vehicles because they couldn\u2019t\nhear. ANC headphones often come with\na \u201ctransparency\u201d mode, which allows\nyou to hear your surroundings better\nby amplifying outside sounds using the\nsame mic used for ANC. However, use\nof this feature is at the user\u2019s discretion.\nSo, ANC \u2013 a necessity or luxury?\nWell in my personal opinion, if you\u2019re\nin the market for a new set of head-phones, and are considering getting a\nwireless one \u2013 which you probably are\ngiven that most new phones today do\nnot have headphone jacks \u2013 then it\u2019s\nworth getting some with ANC, because\nANC is a luxury worth having. Furthermore, as technology matures, prices get\nlower. Nowadays, if you\u2019re not worried\nabout brand hype, then you can get\nsome pretty decent ANC headphones\nfor a reasonable price.

    "content": "10 NEW TERM\u2019S RESOLUTIONS\nFOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE 2022\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMonika Yordanova\nMarie Mori\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment View online here!\nAhhh, the time for resolutions has\ncome around again, and you\u2019ve\ntold yourself that this year, you\u2019re going\nto stick to them properly (or maybe\nyou\u2019re resigned to your fate and have\nalready given up). Regardless of how\nwell you usually do with new YEAR\u2019s\nresolutions, a more realistic goal might\nbe some new TERM\u2019s resolutions.\nIn light of the ongoing climate\nemergency, I personally feel compelled\nto try to live more sustainably in 2022\nand beyond, especially in terms of\nmy carbon impact (I\u2019m not going to\ncall it a \u2018footprint\u2019 here, as the term\nwas originally coined by BP to shift\nenvironmental blame onto individuals),\nso I\u2019m challenging myself to stick to\nsome carbon-conscious resolutions this\nterm.\nI found lots of ideas for resolutions\nand found they fell into three neat\ncategories of reduce, reuse and recycle\n- as well as a bonus category, which\nfocuses more on collective action than\nany impact we can make on our own.\nReduce\n1. Reduce meat intake\nAs we know, food systems make up\na considerable share of our global\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions every\nyear; in fact, the latest figures suggest\nthis share is a staggering 34%! It will\nalso come as no surprise that plants\ncontribute much less to our individual\ncarbon impact than eating meat. This\nis particularly notable in the case of\nbeef, which contributes 8.2 times and\n80 times more CO2 per kcal when\ncompared to vegetables and cereals\nrespectively.\nA common resolution in this space\nis Veganuary, going vegan for the entire\nmonth of January - but as you won\u2019t be\nreading this until mid-Jan at the earliest,\nperhaps try going vegan (or vegetarian)\nfor the next four weeks of term, and see\nhow you get on.\nIf everyone simply limited their beef\nconsumption to the equivalent of 1.5\nburgers per week, it would go halfway\nto meeting global targets on agriculture\nemissions.\n2. Switch up your commute\nNext, we have the commute. Imperial\nstudents are generally very good at\nminimising their carbon impact while\nat university, with most choosing either\nactive forms of transport (walking or\ncycling) or taking advantage of TfL\npublic transport.\nThat being said, there is always room\nfor improvement - so why not try the\nBoris Bike instead of the tube once a\nweek? With every ride, you will further\nincentivise the government to invest in\naccessible, affordable active transport.\n3. Cut down on air travel\nI imagine most people haven\u2019t taken\nmany foreign holidays over the last\ncouple of years, but once normality\nreturns, the \u2018new normal\u2019 we create will\nhave to involve much less air travel.\nComparing GHG emissions for travel\nto numerous European destinations, we\nfind that taking the train rather than the\nplane decreases emissions by an average\nof 83.5%.\nSo this summer, perhaps consider\nthe UK for your next holiday, or if\nyou\u2019re desperate to get abroad, compare\ndifferent modes of transport where you\ncan. This is also a factor to consider\nwhen travelling to conferences abroad.\n4. Say no to \u2018fast fashion\u2019\nThe carbon footprint of the global\nfashion industry is huge, and I mean\nHUGE. Emissions from fashion are the\nthird largest of all supply chains, only\nbehind food and construction. Most of\nthe emissions are a direct result of using\ncrude oil to make synthetic fibres for\ngarments for the fast fashion industry\n- where huge volumes of clothes are\nbought, worn a couple of times, and\nthen forgotten about when the next\ntrend comes along. This incredible\nwastefulness is a product of cheap\nmanufacture, targeted marketing, and\nmarket pressure on the largest clothes\nmanufacturers today.\nTo reduce the volume of clothes\npurchased worldwide, most of the\nchange will have to occur in developed\ncountries (where most clothes are\ncurrently being consumed). We can\nall play a part in this transition by\nconsciously buying clothes of higher\nquality and built to last - this is not only\nan environmentally friendly decision,\nbut it will likely save you money in the\nlong run.\nReuse\n5. Check second-hand first before\nbuying new clothes\nClothes will still have to be\nmanufactured in the future, and once\nthey have incurred the carbon cost of\nproduction, our best shot at reducing\ntheir carbon impact is to REUSE\nthem. Unfortunately, 41% of Britons\nare unaware that there are schemes in\nplace in the UK to facilitate the reuse of\nunwanted clothes, and this is likely why\nso much textile waste ends up in the\nlandfill.\nThis is something I\u2019m particularly\nguilty of myself, and so I am resolved\nto buy more second-hand clothing in\n2022, as well as donating/selling my\nunwanted clothes whenever I can. If you\nwant good quality stuff second-hand,\nthere are some fantastic charity shops in\nSouth Ken that have a great selection.\n6. Bring reusable bags on errands -and ACTUALLY reuse them!\nMost of us have at least one bag-for-life sitting around at home, but how\nmany of those bags actually end up\nbeing \u2018for life\u2019? The more you use your\nbag before replacing it, the more carbon\nemissions you prevent - and studies\nshow that to truly start saving carbon,\nyou should use your bag-for-life at least\nfive times before replacement. This\nstatistic pales in comparison to that of\ncotton tote bags - where the savings\nonly begin after using the bag 181\ntimes!!\nThe statistic for cotton bags alone is\nstaggering, so take a second to decide\nwhether you need another tote bag next\ntime you\u2019re at a careers fair or open day.\nRecycle\n7. Recycle whenever and wherever\nyou can!\nThis one is self-explanatory - but\nalways read the guidance on what\ncan and cannot be recycled and how\nthe material has to be prepared for\nrecycling. (Did you know that all the\nmedical masks we\u2019ve been using in\nthe past two years can be recycled by\nbringing them to shops such as Wilko\nthat do mask recycling schemes?)\nAffect change\n8. Invest well\nAlthough specific data is difficult to\nPhoto credits: cottonbro from Pexels\nTom Cowperthwaite Environment Writer\n8\n\n"

CTSO took action in the country at the\nrequest of the beseiged Kazakhstan government, following severe\nunrest in the city of Almaty, the country\u2019s capital. Protests over the\nprice of oil erupted early in the new year and quickly grew in size\nand calibre of demand. The country\u2019s president Toqaev reversed the\nremoval of an oil price cap and fired his whole cabinet in attempts\nto quell the protesters, however this did not work. 227 have died.\n5G row between airlines and mobile networks\n5G use in the US has led to conflict between airlines and\nmobile providers, who both require the same frequency for\ntheir instruments to work. The proposed frequency is used\nby 5G networks, as well as Boeing aircraft for measuring\naltitude when landing. The controversy led to airlines, most\nnotably Emirates, to cancelling some flights to the US,\nthough service has recently resumed following the all-clear\nfrom the American Federal Aviation Administration.\nPleas for insulin as medical supplies run out in Tigray\nThe conflict that has clutched Ethiopia for 14 months now shows no\nsigns of stopping, as medics in the Tigray region send calls for emergency\ninsulin to prevent the \u201cagonising death\u201d of diabetics. Humanitarian\nsupplies have been cut off by the Ethiopian governmental army, led by\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2016. The\nconflict has persisted between the government and the rebel TPLF, who\nhave previously attempted to retake the capital of Addis Ababa. Both\nsides have been accused of commiting war crimes.\nChina accuses US of \u201cprovocative actions\u201d in the South China Sea\nChina has said it tracked a US ship through the disputed waters of the\nSouth China Sea, between China and Taiwan. This is the latest in a\nstring of tensions that many fear to be the most likely cause of the next\nworld war, were China to invade Taiwan. The Chinese government views\nTaiwan as a break-away state and inherently Chinese, whereas Taiwan\nsees itself as a sovereign state, and is allied to many strong Western\npowers. US hostility to China has been maintained through both\nthe Trump and Biden administrations. Last year Lithuania officially\nrecognised Taiwan as a sovereign state, and China restricted its trade and\ndiplomatic ties with the tiny country as a result.\n... in this issue\u2019s year (1789)\nQuite a lot, considering this is the first time we\u2019ve done this section and the year was essentially selected at random\nFRANCE\nThe French Revolution begins, with the Storming\nof the Bastille.\nSOUTH-EAST ASIA\nVietnamese Emperor Quang Trung defeats Chinese Qing\nforces in one of Vietnam\u2019s greatest military victories.\nTHE UNITED STATES\nGeroge Washington is elected as the first President of the\nUnited States of America.

Hippo Campus\u2019\nhotlyanticipatedthirdstudioalbumdropsonFebruary\n4th2022andthebandhavedroppedanewsinglewhich\nitself was teased with a limited\nedition flexi-disk single at selected\nrecord stores the day before its\nrelease.\nLet me set the scene. I am\nfeeling productive on a Tuesday\nafternoon, so I head to the library\nto try and finish off some lectures\nand problem sheets. Slightly\ndistracted, I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t\npayingfullattentiontothethermo\nlecture and was scrolling through\nInstagram when I see a purple\nmap of the UK with locations highlighted across the\ncountry. It\u2019s a Hippo Campus post from 6 minutes ago.\nReading on I discover they\u2019re releasing a free limited-edition flexi-disk of the new single at selected record\nstores and I\u2019m lucky enough that the London store is\nRough Trade West. Disregarding my degree, I plot a\nroute on CityMapper, close my laptop, and head off on\na search. I did not need to act so hastily. When I get\nto the shop, I ask if they have a Hippo Campus single\nand the lady behind the counter calmy hands me a clear\nfloppy single from a pile of about\ntwenty. My search was complete,\nand it was absolutely worth it:\n\u2018Ride Or Die\u2019 is beautiful.\nThenewsingletakeseverything\nthat catapulted the band to where\nthey are today and honours it.\nJake Luppen, the lead singer, said\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite songs on\nthe record - you can really hear\neveryone in the band doing their\nthing.\u201d Nathan Stocker on guitar\nhas his signature twinkly lead\nriffs which complement Luppen\u2019s vocals throughout\nthe track before ending the song in an ethereal outro,\nand Whistler Allen on drums drives the track with low\ntom rhythms that are reminiscent of the bands early\nhit \u2018South\u2019. By taking their sound back to basics, Hippo\nCampus are embracing their early days while exploring\nthe new ideas of growing up that are prominent on all\nthe singles from LP3.\nWith less than a month until LP3\u2019s release, which is\nthedayafterHippoCampus\u2019Londonshow,excitement\nisbuildinghereinmyflat.Anightlypleathattheywon\u2019t\nhavetocanceltheirshowbecauseofrestrictions(which\nI hope you all join me in) and hopefully the band will\ngrace our shores soon.\n\u201c\nHIPPO CAMPUS\nARE EMBRACING\nTHEIR EARLY DAYS\nWHILE EXPLORING\nNEW IDEAS OF\nGROWING UP\nSingle Reviews\nFKA twigs disorientates and astounds in CAPRISONGS\nWritten by Pallavi Ojha Music Writer\nWith each album release, Tahliah Debrett Barnett,\naka the artist Formerly Known As twigs, unfurls\nlayers of herself. CAPRISONGS gives us a window\ninto FKA twigs\u2019 process, community, and inner\nvoice. This mixtape is no\nstranger to twigs\u2019 distinctive\nsoprano vocals and murky,\nalt-RnB beats. But where\nMAGDALENE and LP1\nhave strong themes and a clear\nstructure, CAPRISONGS\nplayfully switches energy,\nclaiming no theme or genre.\nTwigs sets the mood in the\nfirst track, \u2018run the dragon\u2019:\n\u201cwhenIfeelyou,Ifeelme,and\nwhenIfeelme,itfeelsgood\u201d.In\nearlier releases, twigs adopted\na character and performance,\nbut here she is intentionally\nrevealing, creating a dialogue between artist and\nlistener. These first two songs are marked by a magnetic\npulse. The intoxicating, syncopated rhythms of \u2018honda\u2019\nlean heavily on grime influences, calling back to her\nLondon roots. The atmosphere switches suddenly in\n\u2018meta angel\u2019 to something a little more melancholic,\nsimilartowhatwehavealreadyseeninMAGDALENE.\nBut twigs refuses to fulfil expectations, cutting through\nwith a warm and revealing interlude. As someone who\u2019s\nbeen listening to her since 2015 and seen her rise to\nfame, it\u2019s meaningful to see\nthat she remains entirely\nauthentic. Twigs remarks \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it on my\nown\u201d, a welcome break from\nthe isolation of her previous\nalbum.It\u2019sarecognitionofthe\nnecessity of her community;\nsomething she was stripped\nof during her last relationship\nthat the artist says turned\nabusive.\nBarnett flexes her skills\nas a producer in \u2018papi\nbones\u2019. Shygirl adds a much-needed intensity to\nthis deconstructed club track; her voice acting as\na debauched dark-horse against a backdrop of\npounding afrobeats. This is one I wish I could hear\non a night out.\n\u2018Careless\u2019 returns again to her classic sound, this\ntime with the exceptionally tender vocals of Daniel\nCaesar. I love the quiet confidence and newfound\npower in \u2018which way\u2019, as twigs states: \u201cI\u2019m not the\nrockstar\u2019s girlfriend, I\u2019m the rockstar girlfriend. / I\u2019m\nnot the accessory to the rockstar, I am the rockstar\u201d.\n\u2018Darjeeling\u2019 enshrines her teenage years in London,\ndocumenting her search for identity in her formative\nyears.\nAlright, I know I\u2019m meant to be a pragmatic, logical,\nscientific-method-loving engineer, but the astrological\nreading in \u2018christi interlude\u2019 is excellent. It\u2019s fun and\nsilly, and yet it\u2019s also quite beautiful. Twigs suggests\nastrology can be a way to find meaning and light in\ntrauma or define a path in her creative process.\nMAGDALENE was such a heart-breaking album,\nbut CAPRISONGS takes that misery and searches for\nsomethingjoyouswithinit.Inthelasttrack,\u2018thankyou\nsong\u2019, twigs is finally unafraid to address the darker\nparts of herself and admits to struggling. She also\nrecognises that these difficult truths can ultimately be\nrestorative.\nI think it\u2019s tempting to compare CAPRISONGS\nto previous albums. However, there\u2019s a reason twigs\ndescribes this as a mixtape. It\u2019s experimental, playful,\nand not at all serious. I am excited to see a conceptual\nalbum release in the future, but for now, it is so\nwonderful to see she is healing.\nHippo Campus Drop 3rd Single, \u2018Ride Or Die\u2019, From Upcoming Album LP3\n\u201cSaggi-moon, pisce-vene, capri-sun\u201d - FKA twigs\u2019 new mixtape features astrology, healing, and some truly beautiful songs\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n\n"
