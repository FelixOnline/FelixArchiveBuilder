    "content": "Features Peter Brooke has been\nthe Conservative\nMember of Parliament\nfor the City of\nWestminster and\nWestminster South\nsince 1977. Formerly\nPaymaster General, he\nrecently succeeded\nJeffrey Archer as\nChairman of the\nConservative Party.\n. Earlier this month,\nFELIX Chief Political\nCorrespondent Andrew\nWaller conducted an\ninterview with him in\nthe House of\nCommons.\nDuring his time at Oxford University\nin the 1950s Mr Brooke was Vice\nPresident of the National Union of\nStudents, and one of my initial\nquestions was whether he thought\nImperial College was justified in\nremaining outside of that\norganisation. He replied that he\nalways respected Imperial's decision\nto leave and that it was any\ninstitution's right to do so if it\nbelieved that it would get better value\nfor money by staying independent.\nOn the matter of student loans, he\nsaid he saw the possibility of them\nbeing introduced in the lifetime of this\nParliament (ie before 1992) as the\nreview body to examine student\nsupport, which was set up by the last\nParliament, has continued working\nand is due to report. The body may\nfind in favour of loans, which were\nincluded (but only as a top up\nmeasure) in the Tory manifesto of last\nyear's General Election. When asked\nwhether he thought that student loans\nmay discourage people from certain\nbackgrounds from entering higher\neducation, Mr Brooke remarked tl.at\neven at the present moment about one\nthird of people with the necessary 'A' Level qualifications were deciding not\nto go into higher education. However,\nhe noted that the Department of\nEducation would have to consider\npossible detrimental effects of loans.\nThe Great Education Reform Bill\n(GERBill, which has been described\nin previous issues of FELIX), is going\nthrough Parliament at the moment.\nAmongst other things, if the Bill is\npassed, the University . Grants\nCommitee (UGC) will be replaced\nwith a University Funding Council\n(UFC). For the first time, the\nmajority of members of the\nuniversities' funding body would be\nrepresentatives of commerce and\nindustry. I put it to Mr Brooke that\nthis could be to the detriment of such\nsubjects as Pure Physics and Maths\nwhich do not have short term gains\nfor the country and industry. He\npointed out that many subjects were\nnot represented in the present UGC,\nand said that he felt it was right that\nthe majority of the new body should\nbe composed of people in careers\ninvolved practically with the areas\nmost graduates move into after\nuniversity.\nMr Brooke refused to be drawn on\nwhether he thought Imperial's involvement with SDI was justified\nand remarked that it was up to the\nCollege.\nWith regards his position within the\nConservative Party, Mr Brooke told\nme he does not see that there have\nbeen any major changes since he was\nappointed Chairman. He commented\nthat it takes about six months to\nunderstand how the party works\nbefore seeking any changes.\nMr Brooke explained that there are\nthree things which help him most in\nrunning the Tory Party organisation.\nOne of these is that he runs a business\nwhich is about the same size as the\nTory Party in England and Wales (as\nwith the other main parties, the\nScottish wing is autonomous) which\nemploys about 300 people in its\nLondon Central Office. He also has\nthe experience of having been\nChairman of a Constituency\nAssociation, and a member of\nCamden Borough Council. These\njobs, he feels, enable him to\nemp a this e with voluntary workers and\nhelpers of the party. He has visited\nalmost all of the eleven regions into\nwhich the party is divided in England\nand Wales and describes the party\norganisation as a professional backup to the voluntary organisation. Mr\nBrooke has a part-time deputy;\ntogether they add up to a full-time\nequivalent.\nThe day before the interview, Mr\nBrooke had, with the help of a bulldog, been at the forefront of a major recruitment campaign. The\ncampaign's aim is to recruit more of\nthe record number of people (13.7\nmillion) who voted Conservative in\nthe last general election. Mr Brooke\nsaid he felt that this undertaking was\nnecessary as the Party had last held\na major effort to increase membership\nten years ago; there are currently\nfewer than a million Conservative\nParty members. The disparity\nbetween this figure and the number\nof Tory voters prompted the\ncampaign to be aimed at increasing\nmembership in all constituencies, not\njust those in which the Party has done\nbadly in recent years.\nThe recent controversy surrounding\nthe Prime Minister's speech to the\nAssembly of the Church of Scotland\nhas been widely reported in\nnewspapers, as Opposition parties and\nsome Church of England Bishops\nattack the emphasis of the speech. Mr\nBrooke remarked that it was a brave\nthing of her to have done: once done,\nit would open oneself up to attack\nfrom one's opponents, he said. He did\nnot agree that it was an attempt to\nstorm the moral high ground, rather\nthat Mrs Thatcher had sought to set\nout the Christian underpinning of her\nown views and position as a politician.\nThe fortunes of the Conservative\nParty in Scotland have come under\nclose examination in recent years. At\nthe last general election, for example,\nthe Party won only 10 out of 72 seats.\nWhilst not being directly involved\nwith the party in Scotland, Mr Brooke\nclaimed that the local election results\nlast month showed that there were\nsigns of a recovery (despite being\nout polled by the SNP and controlling\nfewer councils than the SLD) and on\nthe basis of the poll, he suggested that\nsome European Parliamentary seats\ncould be won back.\nThe poll tax has featured in political\ndebate recently and I asked Mr\nBrooke (who, not surprisingly,\nwanted to call it a community charge)\nif he thought it fair that farm hands\nand dukes would pay the same\namount. He replied by asking whether\nVAT was unfair because we all pay\nit regardless of circumstances. He\ndescribed the community charge/poll\ntax as a decision at a local basis as to\nthe level of services a community\nwishes to see rendered in the\ncommunity. In Mr Brooke's view,\nthis could result in a more sensible\nlevel of provision of services, as all\nvoters will have to make financial\ncontributions towards the provision of\nthese services.\nAll the main parties agree that the\npresent system is unfair, said Mr\nBrooke, who conceded that the\nDemocrats had gone some way to\nsuggesting an alternative with their\n64 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

Although quite a dramatic event, forcing the evacuation\nof Linstead Hall, damage was\nfortunately limited to Warren's curtains, and some of his possessions\nwhich were soaked by fire\nextinguishers. The coffee machine is\nsadly no more\u2014an ex-coffee machine\nin fact!\nMore gravely, another 150 place\nin Lexham Gardens are under threat.\nAt the end of May it was announced\nthat a Local Authority inspection had\nfound problems with roofs, drains and\ngutters as well as some breaches in\nfire regulations. It is thought that the\ncost of repairing the faults will make\nit uneconomical for the landlord to\nuse the buildings as student\nresidences. The current lease runs out\nat the end of this month.\nNegotiations with the landlord had\ncarried on for some time before\nFinance Section's Malcolm Aldridge\ndecided it was unlikely that a settlement would be reached.\n'It's so funny that we\ndon't talk anymore'\nadded that he wishes such a sale to\nbe held every year.\nThe College's Governors set a target of 100 more students next year,\nin an attempt to reduce the College's debt. In January, ICU President Ian\nHowgate criticised the decision as\nshort-sighted and claimed that the\nCollege would not be able to honour\nits guarantee of a year in hall to all\nfirst year undergraduates and overseas\npostgraduates. Rayleigh House was to\nbe sold, with a loss of 26 places, in\norder to pay for the furnishing of the\nnew, 200 place Evelyn Gardens block\nnow called Fisher Hall.\nThirty of the Fisher Hall places will\nbe used as Subwardens' rooms and\nhigher priced accommodation, and\ntwenty five other places in Evelyn\nGardens will no longer be available.\nThe next week a notice from the\nEnvironmental Health Officer\ndeclared four single rooms in Lexham\nGardens were too small for\noccupation.\nBy the end of the Spring Term it\nlooked as if only 35 places had been\ngained by taking on the new hall in\nEvelyn Gardens:\nLost\n130 Hamlet Gardens\n30 Earl's Court Square\n26 Rayleigh\n25 Evelyn Gardens\n4 Lexham Gardens\nTotal=215\nGained\n170 Evelyn Gardens\n80 Hamlet Gardens\nTotal=250 =a gain of 35 places\nHowever, there will also be 100 more\nstudents requiring accommodation\nnext year. This leaves 65 places to be\nfound.\nThroughout the year, another\nchange in the organisation of College\naccommodation has been discussed.\nA new postgraduate-only hall was\nproposed in order to improve the\nsocial life and working conditions for\npost grads, as well as making the\nSummer Accommodation Scheme\nmore efficient. Southside residents\nstrongly opposed the exclusion of\nundergraduates from any part of the\nSouthside halls, and they proposed a UGM motion to this affect* which\nwas passed.\nEventually the SRC decided to ask\nVickers' permission to make Weeks\na post grad only hall. Vickers gave\nmoney towards the building of Weeks\non the condition that rooms were\nreserved for their sponsored students,\nbut it was thought that rooms in other\nhalls could be substituted.\nUnfortunately Vickers refused and\nSRC has yet to make another\nsuggestion. The other halls have all\nbeen ruled out for a variety of\nreasons.\nSilwood Park students also had\ncause for complaint over\naccommodation this year. Sandyride\nHouse, bought in 1970 to house\noverseas students, was sold in order\nto build upgraded blocks containing\ntwo-person flats and single rooms\nwith proper kitchen facilities.\nHowever, Silwood Administrator\nKeith Fisher was unwilling to\nguarantee all these places to full-time\nSilwood students. The flats will be\navailable for former Sandyride\nresidents, he said, but the single\nrooms will be used for short-course\nparticipants this summer. It is not\nclear who will use the single rooms\nthis time.\nWilly Munro, the Silwood Union\nChair, has proposed that residents of\nthe William Penney Hall should move\ninto the new blocks as soon as they\nare completed.

The first sign of this came in\nFreshers' Week, with President Ian\nHowgate's criticism of the week's events\u2014and the angry reply of John\nNoble, the Entertainments Officer.\nDespite this, Ents took a large amount\nof money and the events were widely\nthought to be a success.\nThe beginning of the term brought\nsome more good news for the Union\nwhan it was known that the profits\nfrom Harlington Gravel would be\nused for student facilities rather than\nto ease the College's cash flow\nproblems.\nSTOIC, the student television\ngroup, made a long-awaited return to\nscreens around College at the\nbeginning of the year.

    "content": "\u2022 MORE TALES of sexual\nperversion reach my ears. Neil\nMotteram, ICU External Affairs\nOfficer, has admitted to another\nmis demean our. At the FELIX cricket\nmatch a few weeks back, Mr\nMotteram revealed a further incident\nthat took place at his secondary\nschool. Apparently, his underpants\nwere itching him so much that he\ndecided to cut them off. This took\nplace in a fourth year maths lesson,\naided and abetted by a pair of scissors\nbelonging to House Committee ChairElect, Andrew 'Midget' Thompson.\nMr Motteram went on to elaborate\nhow he had disposed of the\nunderpants in the classroom waste\npaper bin. A reliable eye-witness i.e. Mr Thompson maintains that the bin\nwas ten yards away from him at the\ntime and that he had thrown the\noffending article halfway across the\nclassroom. Mr Motteram, however,\nswears blind that he only 'placed' the\nrags in the bin!\n\u2022 A BAR EXTENSION was\narranged last Friday in the Union\nbuilding. It was originally intended\nfor the guests at the President's Dinner\u2014a suitable place to retire to\nafter their meal. It was pointed out\nhowever, that this was ever so slightly\nillegal, as it would constitute a private\nparty, thereby breaking the terms of\nthe license. The solution, therefore,\nwas to open the late bar up to\neveryone attending the Ents gig in the\nUnion building on the same night. As\nit happens, the Lounge Bar and Union\nBar. although technically one bar\nunder the terms of the license, were\nsegregated to the extent that anyone\nwho had not attended the President's Dinner was denied access to the\nUnion Bar. Tut tut tut.\n\u2022 WHILST ON the subject, the\nLounge Bar closed promptly at 1\nO 'Clock\u2014the agreed extension. The\nUnion Bar, however, stayed open\nuntil nearly 2 O 'Clock\u2014breaking the\nlaw. Who was present? Union\nPresident Sydney Harbour-Bridge and\nUnion Hon Sec Chas Jackson, not to\nmention countless other top Union\nnotables. Tut tut tut.\n\u2022 TALKING OF BOOZE, now is\n*he time to reveal a small incident that\noccurred on Sunday May 1st of this\nyear. ICU President Sydney HarbourBridge was still feeling thirsty after\nSouthside Bar had kicked everyone\nout for the night. He and his\nassociates, members of Bean's Club,\ndecided to steal a barrel from\nSouthside. After gaining entry to\nFalmouth-Keogh Hall (by fair means\nor foul\u2014this is unclear), they\nremoved a barrel of Castlemaine\nXXXX lager and wheeled it back in\na shopping trolley to Holbein House.\nHolbein, surprise, surprise, possesses\na beer cooler unit. The offending\nbarrel was drunk and presumably left.\nIt probably still resides behind the\nHolbein bar to this day. Mr HarbourBridge and his com patria tes were\nspotted by three separate witnesses on\ntheir way to the Bean's lair. The boys\nin question didn't even have the good\nsense to remove their Bean's ties\nCollege refectory staff know about\nthis. Sources in Southside Bar know\nabout this. It was even joked about at\nCouncil on Monday. Why has such\na blatant act of theft gone unchecked?\nIf the Union see fit to investigate\nalleged losses in the Union Bar/Snack\nBar which involves the sacking of a permanent member of staff, why do\nthey choose to ignore an illegal act by\nthe President of the Union?\n\u2022 AFTER A QUIET evening's drinking in a local pub with friends,\nICU Deputy President Alan Rose had\nto negotiate a rather busy zebra\ncrossing on the Shepherds Bush Road.\nHaving waited patiently for five\nseconds or so, and being rather the\nworse for alcohol, Mr Rose could\ncontain himself no longer and rushed\nout in front of the traffic. Fortunately\nthe car speeding towards him and his\nfiance stopped in the nick of time.\nUnfortunately the car behind wasn't so lucky and a rather major crash\nechoed around Hammersmith.\nMr Rose's friends hurried on up the\nroad oblivious to the resulting scene.\n\u2022 FELIX SUPREMO Judith\nHackney and a friend went shopping\nlast Saturday to buy some cases of\nchampagne for tonight's FELIX\nbuffet dinner. Knowing that the bill\nwould come to approximately \u00a3180,\nshe wasn't quite sure how to arrange\npayment. Sainsbury's, however,\nreadily agreed to take a cheque for\none hundred pounds accompanied by\ncash. This cleaned Ms Hackney and\nfriend out. Forgetting this, the friend\nwent out in the middle of Cromwell\nRoad de spar at ely trying to hail a taxi.\nThe result was that the dynamic duo\nwere heading down Prince Consort\nRoad in a cab with not two pennies\nto rub between them. Realising their\nmistake, the taxi meter was left\nticking away as Ms Hackney\nfrantically chased around the Union\nBuilding looking for some cash with\nwhich to pay the unfortunate driver.\n\u2022 'ALLEGED' Masonic Lodge\nmember Sydney Harbour-Bridge (1 \u00b0)\nhanded out social colours to some\nmembers of staff at Monday night's Council meeting. Recipients were\nAssistant College Secretary Peter\nMee (3\u00b0), College Registrar James\nChalmers (3\u00b0), Natwest Bank\nManager George Jameson (3\u00b0) and\nComputing lecturer Roy Francis (3\u00b0\nand member of Imperial College\nLodge No. 4536).\nWould such a bunch of old fools\nhave got social colours if they weren't members of the Masonic Lodge?\n\u2022FINALLY, it is with regret that\nFELIX must announce the death of\none of its most devoted and regular\nmembers of staff. Chris Jones is no\nmore. At the tender age of 31 issues,\nChris has died of that age-old\npseudonyms disease, recognition. Mr\nJones was born in the first issue of the\nyear with only one aim on this\nplanet\u2014to prove a point. The idea\nwas to create a character out of thin\nair and attempt to gain him some kind\nof College-wide recognition. The\nultimate aim was to run Chris for ICU\nPresident to show that it doesn't matter what one does at college as\nlong as one is well-known to the\nstudent populace. The idea got off to\na good start, particularly when Chris\nwas writing his own column for\nFELIX. Alas, like most secrets, the\ncat was soon out of the bag, and Chris\nwas demoted to the very depths of the\nLibel column, later joined by his\nfellow nom de plume Delator. It is the\nhope of the current Libel columnist,\ni.e. The real Chris Jones, that one day\nChris will be back in another guise,\nhoodwinking College yet again, but\nthis time with a slightly longer shelf-life and an explosive finale. Who\nknows, one day the name of Chris\nJones may well be inscribed on the\nwooden plaque listing ICU\nPresidents.

    "content": "It hasn't really been a good year for\nstudents in London. Under the third\nterm of the Conservative\nadministration our position has never\nbeen more threatened. The academic\nfreedom of our lecturers is under\nattack. We can not afford the rents in\nLondon, and these promise to\nincrease with the Housing Bill. The\nlevel of financial support we receive\nis effectively eroded and now again\nunder threat from student loans. Our\npolitical representatives are divided\nand spend more bickering about\nleft ish politics than student issues. Is\nthere any hope?\nThe grant for next academic year\nfor London students not living at\nhome will be \u00a32425. This is a total\nincrease of 4.8 per cent. Rents have\nincreased by somewhat more. Last\nyear Kenneth Baker was quoted in\nsaying that students could no longer\nafford to live on the grant. The\naverage overdraft after one year at\nUniversity is around \u00a3450. The\nGovernment has responded by again\nproposing the introduction of student\nloans.\nThe Education Act was passed a few weeks ago. During its passage\nthrough Westminster it was known as\nthe Great Education Reform Bill (or\nGERBill). Small and cute it was not.\nThis monstrous piece of legislation\nchanged the entire structure of British\neducation. It totally altered the\ncurriculum and control in schools\ndespite opposition from parents and\nteachers alike. It set up new colleges\nfunded by industry to produce the\nskilled workforce that they now\nrequire. It abolished the Inner London\nEducation Authority.\nGERBill's effect on students in\nhigher education is more subtle. The\nfunding of Universities and poly s has\nbeen radically altered. Previously the\ngovernment has been told by the\nUniversity Grants Committee what\nthe requirements of each institution\nwere and gave the UGC this money\n(or less) to distribute to the\nUniversities. Polytechnics and other\ncolleges were all funded by local\nauthorities. Each institution\nOPINION:\nTHE GREAT EDUCATION REFORM BILL\nNeil Motteram is this year's Imperial College Union External Affairs Officer.\nHe is currently studying for a degree in the Department of Computing. He has\nhelped to organise the day of action protesting against the new Bill.\npractically had the freedom to\ndistribute funds internally themselves.\nNow the new funding councils will\nmerely advise the Government as to\nhow to distribute a set amount of\nmoney. The Secretary of State will\nactually have the power to allocate\nexactly where money is spent in the\ncolleges and to demand its return if\nnot spent as to instructions. This has\nbeen stretched such that it is implied\nthat he could actually refuse funding\nfor a person's salary ie sacking an\nacademic who speaks out against the\nGovernment.\nGERBill was considerably\nweakened during its passage after\npressure from many opposition\ngroups (including Imperial College\nUnion). Even so. the freedom of the\ncollege to control its own affairs has\nbeen weakened. The cuts in our\nGeology Department extend from a system of bidding for grants on a basis\nof cost effectiveness (called contract\nfunding). Widespread contract\nfunding, which could be introduced\nunder the Act, would probably place\na grave threat over such IC\ndepartments as Physics, Maths and\nMaterials.\nWandering through the Lords' at\nthe present time are two Bill's which\nfurther damage the position of\nstudents in London. The Housing Bill\nwill deregulate the rented property\nsector in which nearly all of us are\nforced to live. Rents have already\nbeen rising in London at a rate\nconsiderably more than our income.\nThe changes in housing benefit in\nApril meant that nearly everyone lost\nbetween two and six pounds per\nweek. This has not been made up in\nthe grant.\nThe Housing Bill is designed to\nmake investing in property and letting\nit out more attractive to both private\nlandlords and institutions. It does this\nby removing many of the rights of\ntenants to security against eviction and\na fair rent. This will expand the\nmarket in rented property supposedly\nlowering rents to 'market levels'. The\nproblem is that the demand for\naccommodation in London is so great\n(with 100,000 homeless) that rents\nwill, in fact, skyrocket. It is estimated\nthat, combined with benefit changes,\nthe average under-25-year-old will be\nup to \u00a311 worse off after the Till.\nLagging slightly behind *he\nHousing Bill is the Local Authorities\n(Financial Support) Bill. This\nabolishes the rates and introduces a Community Charge common to all\nvoting citizens. The Poll Tax. It has\nbeen put into the Bill that the\nminimum that anyone (ie students)\nwill have to pay will be 20 per cent\nof the full charge. In inner London\nthis has been estimated to be up to\n\u00a3600. An extra \u00a360 charge per year\nwhich will not come out of any\nincrease in the grant. It is doubted that\nlandlords will reduce rents just\nbecause they no longer have to pay\nrates (even though local authorities\nestimate 30 per cent of rents to be a rate element).\nOver all the situation for students\nis slowly becoming untenable. The\npolitical influence of the NUS (whose\npolicies we do not even influence) is\nnegligible. Our overworked students\nhave not the time nor interest to\nprotest their survival and it is doubted\nwhether our voice would even be\nheard amongst the cries of support for\nthe Government from the yuppy\nmasses. We are being forced out of\nLondon and into debt by the greed of\nshort-sighted administration. Could it\nbe that Imperial College Union\nactually takes a political stance?\nCould it be time that we no longer\nrec commend that prospective students\ncome to London without independant\nfinancial security? Is the death of\nImperial College for see able? FELIX Wednesday June 22nd198817 "

Tfte Wimbledon All-England Tennis\nChampionships run through until 3rd Julx this year.\nThe College is\nbeginning to drain\nof life as exam\ntime draws to a close. Some of us\n- will spend the\nSummer at our\nindustrial sponsors,\nwhereas others will\nsee a bit more of\nthe world. The\nunlucky few have\nto remain in\nLondon, either to\npursue PhDs or\nclean our halls of\nresidence.\nSport\nThere's still a great deal happening\nin London over the Summer. The\ntennis championships at Wimbledon\ngo on for the next two weeks. If you\nturn up early and queue you can get\nsome really cheap seats but don't forget the strawberries and cream!\nThe favourite for the Men's title is\nIvan Lendl at 11-4. Last year's winner\nPat Cash (who incident ly beat Lendl\nin the final) is 7-2 and Boris Becker,\nthe 1986 winner, is 10-3.\nWimbledon will be well televised\nby the BBC, as will the Olympics\nfrom Korea. IC man Geoff Parsons\nshould be there as Britain's best high\njumper, giving you the opportunity to\npoint at the television and proclaim\nloudly T go to college with that man!'\nIt doesn't look as if British football\nteams will be let back into Europe\nfollowing the violence in West\nGermany last week. It's a great pity,\nespecially for Wimbledon FC who\nwon the FA Cup this year and would\nhave gone to Europe for the first time\nin their history.\nCarnival Theatre\nIf the police give the go-ahead, the\nNotting Hill Carnival will take place\nover the Bank Holiday period right at\nthe end of August. If you don't mind\ncrowds, heat, muggings and knife\nattacks then the Carnival is a really\ngroovy place to go. The excitement\ntakes place from 1 lam till late on both\nthe Sunday and Monday. The floats\nstart off at Ladbrooke Grove and are\npursued through the streets of North\nCentral London to the sounds of the\nCaribbean and the smell of rice and\npeas.\nThere is plenty of good theatre on at\nthe moment. If you fancy watching\nsome good Shakespeare, then you\ncan't do better than go to the Barbican\nand watch the RSC perform Julius\nCaesar. You can pick up a ticket for\njust \u00a36 if you've got your Union card\nat hand.\nThe West End theatres aren't very\nadventurous at the moment. You can\nstill catch Les Miserables or The\nPhantom of the Opera, if you don't mind vying with all those American\ntourists. Alternatively, you can seek\nout the Fringe London theatres such\nas the Almeida in Islington, The Man\nin the Moon on the Kings Road or the\nLyric in Hammersmith, currently\nshowing Facades starring Frances De\nLa Tour.\n66 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Coming to America\nIt looks like Eddie Murphy will have\nanother huge hit with this comedy\nwhich he wrote himself. In it he play s the prince of a mythical African\nkingdom who travels to New York in\nsearch of a bride. The film re-unites\nEddie Murphy with director John\nLandis, after Trading Places, and costars James Earl Jones. Later in the\nyear Murphy makes his dramatic\ndebut in Fences.\n(29th July)\nSwitching Channels\nThe plot sounds familiar\u2014a love\ntriangle develops between three\nplayers in the game of Network TV\nnews. We've seen it before in\nBroadcast News, which was\nexcellent, and so this film is at an\nimmediate disadvantage in that it\nlacks originality of subject matter and\nhas a lot to live up to. I'm sure that\nthis film will be nowhere near as good\nas Broadcast News, but it does boast\nKathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and\nChristopher Reeve.\n(26th August)\nHawks\nTimothy Dalton takes a break from\nhis Bond duties to exercise his\ncomedic and acting skills in this\nBritish film about two terminally ill\npatients^Dalton and Anthony\nEdwards (Top Gun)\u2014who decide that\nif they have to die, they might as well\ndie with smiles on their faces, and so\nthey steal an ambulance and head for\nthe brothels of Amsterdam. Their\nensuing adventures are marked with\na serious message concerning the\nterminally ill.\n(5th August)\nRambo III\nRambo III begins with Rambo living\nin a Buddhist monastery in Thailand,\nwhere he has gone to find inner peace.\nOne wonders whether this is supposed\nto be a comedy. But then it's life back\nto normal with Sylvester Stallone (still\nfighting his personal battle with the\nRuskies) going into Afghanistan to\nsave his captive colonel friend\n(Richard Crenna) from those evil\ncom mies. I wonder how many\nthousands of Russian soldiers he'll\nblow away in the attempt.\n(26th August)\nThe Running Man\nArnold Schwarzenegger is back to\ndelight us with his acting skills in this\naction-packed futuristic thriller, based\non a Stephen King Story. He plays a game-show contestant, but the object\nof the game is to stay alive. It may\nbe silly but it should be great\n(30th September)\nRattle and Hum\nNo release date has been set yet for\nthis long-awaited U2 concert film.\nThe probable time of release is\nSeptember or, appropriately,\nOctober. A live double album will\nfollow.\nBeetlejuice\nAmerican comedian Michael Keaton\nwas badly in need of a hit film, and\nfound it in this screwball comedy\nwhich did very well in the states.\n(19th August)\nGood Morning Vietnam\nNot another Vietnam film, you may\nbe saying, but this one is different.\nIt's a well made comedy based on a true story and stars Robin Williams\nwho was nominated for an oscar for\nhis performance as a DJ on the local\nArmed Forces Radio Network in\nVietnam. The film was an enormous\nhit in the States, and should do well\nhere. At last we have a film that\nmakes full use of Robin William's considerable talent.\n(30th September)\nlew s Frantic\nHarrison Ford doesn't make many\nfilms these days, but what he does is\nalways really good. So it is worth\nlooking forward to this thriller set in\nParis and directed by Roman\nPolanski.\n(5th September)\nStars and Bars\nThis is a tale of two cultures with\nDaniel Day Lewis (Unbearable\nLightness of Being) as a young\nEnglish art expert who is sent to\nGeorgia to convince the owner of a long-lost Renoir to sell it to him. The\nhumourous encounter pits upper-class\nBritish culture with the wiles of the\ndeep South.\n(16th September)\nNo Man's Land\nIn America, a car is stolen every 29\nseconds, mostly by professional car\nthieves. In No Man's Land Charlie\nSheen plays the villa nous head of a large auto theft ring, with DB Sweeney as an undercover cop\nseeking to convict Sheen, but\neventually being seduced by the easy\nmoney, exotic nightlife and seductive\ndanger of the criminal world.\n(23rd September)\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198869 "

    "content": "The Rose Interview\ninterviewed for FELIX by Paul Shanley\nWhat have you gained from this\nyear?\nI 've gained a lot of experience which\ncan only be of value to me in the\nfuture. I suppose. Even the incidents\nwhich I would not have liked to have\ntaken place have had their benefits.\nKnowing all about the bulls h*t is an\nimportant skill.\nYou mention incidents that have\ntaken place. Would you care to\nelaborate on these?\nWell, the most important one is the\nUnion Bar/Snack Bar incident. It's something that always could have\nhappened. I well recall the Union Bar\nManager saying as much when we\ntook the thing over. It showed up all\nthe weaknesses that there were in the\nUnion, partly administratively. There\nare too many people concerned with\ncovering their own backs and not\nconcerned with sorting a problem out\neven if it means them taking an\nelement of responsibility themselves.\nYou have been criticised recently\nfor taking on a second job with a computing firm. Do you feel that\nyour actions have been justifiable?\nSome people will criticise anything if\nthe right strings are pulled. The job\noffer that I took, I'd been actively\nper suing before the decision to take\naway my responsibilities regarding\nthe various retail outlets that were\naffected. My employers wanted me to\n\u2022start early. I could have stayed and\ndone bugger all all year. Alternatively,\nI could have stayed and made the sh*t stuck where it belonged and at the\nsame time attempted to clear my\nname. At the end of the day, I thought\nck you. I'm going to work in a professional environment. At the time\nthere was a feeling regarding how\neveryone was being treated. The easy\nanswer is that not enough people were\nangry enough\u2014they should have\nbeen. I suppose one could blame it on\napathy or pressure of work or people\nbelieving bollocks because it's the\neasiest thing to do.\n\u2022\nHave you any regrets about the past\nyear?\nI probably trusted too many people's good nature too much for too long.\nI naively believed that the people I worked with were working for the\nUnion instead of themselves. I'm very\nbitter about that. Realistically, the\nonly other thing to do would have\nbeen to have resigned early instead of\nmaking a go of it. This would have\nbeen the wrong thing to do. I also\nregret not backing Wimbledon for the\nCup.\nHave you enjoyed any of the past\nyear?\nYeh.\nWhat?\n(Pause)\nIt's difficult to put into words. I 've\nenjoyed it when things have gone well\nand I 've particularly enjoyed chairing\nUFC (Union Finance Committee).\nDo you feel that you've achieved\nanything as Deputy President?\nWell that question is just about as\npredictable as a Stock. Aitken and\nWaterman song, but never mind. I'd like to answer it 'no, bugger all and\nI don't care' but perhaps that wouldn't be true. The things that I 've achieved\nare relatively minor in terms of what\nhas actually been seen to be done.\nHowever, I truthfully believe that has\nalways been the case for any one\nsabbatical. One can't leave the year\nclaiming any achievements which are\nonly insincere promises, pipe dreams and half-baked ideas. I'd like to feel\nthat I 've brought some realism to the\nrole. Perhaps I ought to say that its\nrather like being at the controls of a supertanker for five minutes.\nChanging direction would be nice but\nit's about as unlikely as stopping the\nthing, as my old mate Gren would\nsay.\"\nWhat do you think of your\nsuccessor?\nI try not to think about my successor.\nWhich College official do you\nadmire most and why?\nTerry Neville (College Finance\nOfficer). Because he has been stuck\nwith a situation far and above\nanything Imperial College Union has\nhad to cope with. He still tries, he still\ncares and he bought me a beer once.\n1\nI understand that you've been\ncooking a lot lately. What >\ns your\nfoolproof recipe for quiche?\nWell, if you can't thieve it or buy it,\nthen I usually use three eggs and the\neyes of dead children. Hike to eat it\naccompanied by a dry white wine and\ngood intelligent company. But one\nfinds it so hard to come by these days.\nHow have you got on with your\nfellow sabbaticals this year?\nIt's tended to vary. Occassionally\nwe've worked well together this year,\nbut that has been fairly infrequent.\nI 've often been very worried about\ntheir motives. My attitude now varies\nbetween indifference and amusement.\nI couldn't help managing a wry smile\nwhen my girlfriend told me that she'd nearly, accidently of course, run over\none of them on two separate\noccasions.\nWhat is your attitude to the Union\nreorganisation?\nI don't think it was very well\nconceived. There were lots of good\nideas. However, I think the intention\nwas to change everything overnight.\nThis just can't be done. An analogy\nis the College finance system. Here\nthe changeover was done after large\namounts of useful consultation took\nplace. With the Union reorganisation,\na lot of people who could have been\nconsulted weren't.I'm very worried\nabout the way the word 'professional'\nis bandied about. Okay, the Union\nshould conduct its affairs in a professional way, but it's also\nimportant not to lose track of why\nwe're here and what we're doing. The\nbest throwaway remark from one of\nthe protagonists is that the Union\noffice looks just like 'a student union\noffice'. I find this remark amazing.\nWhat direction will the Union take\nnext year?\nI think it's going to be a crucial year\nnext year. How it will shape up all\ndepends on the people involves. What\nis needed is people with the ability to\ncompromise. This won't happen if an\nidealist course is stuck to, with\nofficers clinging to the ethos of '1 am\nright, so nothing else matters'.\nFELIX Wednesday 22nd June 1988 15\n\n"

See you around College\nnext year and have a great Summer.\nLots of love,\nIt's been a strange year. The student\nUnion has had more than its fair share\nof disasters\u2014the loss of \u00a335,000 from\nthe Snack Bar, the departure of the\nDeputy President, and Sydney\nHarbour Bridge's trendy haircut have\nprovoked frequent cries of \"Oh shit\"\nfrom the Union big-wigs. It seemed\nto have so much potential at the start\nof the year.\nWhat will next year bring ? With\nthe reorganisation of the Union and\nthe appointment of two new\npermanent staff members, and with\nnext year's sabbaticals on speaking\nterms, it could be very exciting\nindeed. But of course, it could be an\nunmitigated disaster.\nAt about this time every year the\nincumbent FELIX Editor is asked to\nproduce a spiel telling the world how\nher (o! hi: , nation will be the best\nthing since (insert your own\nclich e here). It has always seemed to\nme to be very self indulgent.\nNevertheless, here's a summary of\nwhat ' ' lit expect to find in\nFELIX next year and some gentle\nencouragement/b latent recruitment\nfor anyone who might be interested\nin helping out next year.\nphotographs of events appear as they\nhappen. FELIX has its own darkroom\nand processing facilities. If you are\ninterested in becoming involved in the\nphotographic side, we can teach you\nhow to take and develop pictures.\nAre You a Postgraduate?\nSomething that I am very anxious to\nachieve is a greater input from\npostgraduates. FELIX has generally\nHere's to next ve arI am optimistic that we can extend the\nnews coverage to three pages per\nweek. There will be much more\ncoverage of the dealings within the\nCollege and the Departments which\nwill inevitably have a knock-on effect\non students. Similarly our reporters\nwill be probing into the decisions\nmade by the Union and bringing them\nout into the open. There will also be\ncoverage of major clubs events,\nULU, and, I hope a greater input\nfrom postgraduates.\nNext year's News Editor is very\nenthusiastic, but he needs your help.\nIf you know of anything happening\nwithin College, your hall of\nresidence, etc, or if you are planning\nan expedition to a remote part of the\nworld, come and tell us about it.\nThere is always room for reporters in\nFELIX, and, if you fancy trying your\nhand, then drop in for a chat and a coffee. Reporting is one of the most\nchallenging and rewarding aspects of\nwork on FELIX. All you need is\nenthusiasm\u2014we can teach you how\nto write in ' News Style'.\n'Take them out and shoot them.' GripPipe Fin 1954.\nOur Photographic Editor will be\nworking very closely with the News\nTeam to ensure that up to date\nbeen orientated towards\nundergraduates: however, there are a large number of postgraduates at\nImperial. With this in mind Next\nyear's FELIX will have a 'Postgraduate Correspondent',\nYousef Samrout, a mathematics\npost grad has agreed to act as a link\nbetween postgraduates and FELIX.\nYousef is an interesting and\napproachable character with the\ndistinction of having been kidnaped\nin Tripoli amongst his claims to fame.\nHopefully Yousef will keep his ear to\nthe ground for anything which will\naffect postgraduates. If you are a postgraduate, and you would like to\nhave a chat with Yousef, he can be\ncontacted on internal 5767. The\nsuccess of this experiment depends\nlargely on the feedback we recieve\nfrom PGs. If something is happening\nwhich might affect postgraduates then\nwe need to be told, and similarly if\nany PGs have any suggestions for\nfeature articles or other aspects of\nFELIX they should get in touch with\neither myself or Yousef.\nOver the Summer I intend to\nproduce a number of Postgraduate\nIssues. The issue dates have not been\nfinalised, but four page copies of\nFelix should be appearing at roughly\nfortnightly intervals. As always we\nare open to any contributions,\narticles, possible news stories, et\ncetera from post grads and any\nundergrads around over the Summer.\nIn a 'ion to the serious side of\nFELL .xt year's publication will\ncontain a proportion of lighter\narticles. There will be a regular\nhumour page and cartoons courtesy\nof Noel Curry, his flat mate( whose\nname I 've forgotten\u2014sorry) and Dave\nGriffiths. There will also be a regular\nmusic spot, sports reports, and a what's on for those at a loss for\nsomething to do. I would like to see\nsome opinion articles from the\npolitical societies and any students\nwith strong views. There will also be\nsome in depth reports of club\nacv ti vi ties. At a loose End?\nWe are looking for a Music Editor,\na Science Editor and a Sports Editor.\nThe posts involve hassling people to\ncontribute articles, some writing and\nediting and some layout design\n(pasting up). If anyone is interested\nin any of these they should get in\ntouch. In addition we need the usual\nquota of reporters, photographers and\nfeature writers. These posts next year\nwill be fairly flexible and there will\nbe ample scope for trying your hand\nat the other activities in the paper.\nMembership Cards and Club\nPublicity.\nI would be grateful if any clubs and\nsocieties etc requiring membership\ncards or other printing work over the\nSummer would get in touch as soon\nas possible. I will not be able to\nguarantee that printing will be\ncompleted by fresher s week, if clubs\ndo not make contact soon.\nSubscriptions\nAnyone wishing to subscribe to\nFELIX next year can do so for the\nsum of \u00a310. This covers the postage\nfor a year's subscription. Call in the \u2022\nFELIX Office for details.\nHave a good Summer.\nBill Goodwin\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198881 "

He said\nhe was nervous, however, that such\na local income tax could lead to more\npeople being driven out of inner\ncities.\nHe reasoned that there is already \u00ab\nproblem like this in Liverpool (where\nthe Tories have two out of the\nhundred council seats) and in several\nLondon Boroughs, where people with\no over nm ent's job in a democratic\nsystem to secure a majority; otherwise\nit would lose its business. If it had lost\nand the amendment had been carried,\nthe Government whips would have\njeen roundly criticised. Mr Brooke\nremarked that it seemed strange that\nthey were now being criticised for\ndoing their job too well. He drew\nattention to the votes of the cross\n'get up and go' have got up and gone.\nBusinesses have also been forced out\nby high rates and the cycle of inner\ncity deprivation has become worse\nwith even less investment in these\nareas as a consequence.\nI asked Mr Brooke about the Lords'\nvote on an amendment to alter the poll\ntax legislation, which had prompted\nmany peers who hardly ever go to the\nHouse to attend and vote. The\nattendance was, in fact, the second\nhighest ever recorded. The\namendment would have deviated the\npoll tax system from the\nGovernment's original aim, making\nit fairer in the opinion of the\nopposition and rebel Tory peers.\nMr Brooke said he did not feel that\nthe Conservatives had scored an own\ngoal. He commented that it was the\nbench peers who have no party\nall eg ien ces, the majority of whom\nvoted with the Government (perhaps\njust to reduce their personal yearly\nrates bills by several thousand\npounds).\nAs he is a former Borough\nCouncillor, I asked Mr Brooke\nwhether he thought that the role of\nlocal government has changed over\nrecent years. He replied that he felt\nhe couldn't really comment as he was\nno longer closely enough involved.\nHowever, he did say that the job was\n\u2022'do-able' when he was a Borough\nCouncillor, although it was\ndemanding of time to spend in\nmeetings and in general politics. Mr\nBrooke admitted to a suspicion that\nthe workload of councillors in some\nparts of the country has been\nneedlessly increased because meetings\ndrag on due to incompetence. This is\nhaving the net effect of discouraging\nthe more able people from being\ncouncillors, thus reducing the quality\nof people coming into the job.\nBoth of Mr Brooke's parents were\ninvolved in local government, and he\nexpressed his belief that being a councillor was a good training for his\nwork as a Member of Parliament.\nCamden was, in his words, a particularly 'colourful' council.\nOn the question of the decreasing\npowers of local government and\nincreasing centralisation, Mr Brooke\nsuggested that the Parties criticising\nthis policy did not recognise that the\nConservative Party structure was\nmore de centralised than their own.\nThis decentralisation has led to S'^ me\nuncertainty about the Conservat 'e Party membership figures, as the 561,\nconstituency associations are\nsupposedly self-governing and the\nParty Chairman's powers of\nintervention are very limited. This\ncontrasts with the national\norganisations of the Labour Party and\nDemocrats. Mr Brooke made the\nstartling claim that the opposing\nparties do not have the same level of\ndelegation of power to local level that\nthe Tories have.\nDrawing on his experiences as\nParty Chairman and in local politics,\nMr Brooke commented that\nconstituencies can be well lit at times\nand then decline when several good\npeople leave the association. When I asked whether he was concerned that\nmany northern constituencies were\nnot so well lit he attempted to prove\nthat the political map of England and\nWales had changed very little in over\none hundred years.\nAs an example, he referred to the\ntraditional support for the\nConservative Party in the North West\nwhich, he said, stems from the days\nwhen mill workers did not want to\nvote for the same party as the Liberal\nmill owners. According to Mr\nBrooke, the pattern has persisted to\nthis day, and the Tories 'effectively'\ngained as many seats as Labour in the\nNorth West. He asserted that there\nwas an ebb and flow of seats and that\nchanges take far longer than one\nGeneral Election to come through.\nHowever, the Tories have never\nbefore had such a small number of\nScottish MPs and they have few or no\nMPs in major cities like Liverpool\nand Newcastle.\nBritain is out of step with the rest\nof the EEC (and Northern Ireland) in\nnot using Proportional Representation\nto elect its members of the European\nParliament, and there have been\nclaims that this contravenes the Treaty\nof Rome. Mr Brooke said that he has\nconsistently believed that if PR is to\nbe introduced then it would be better\nto try it out at local level first. He told\nme that he felt it unlikely that PR\nwould be introduced 'at this juncture',\nin view of the Euro-elections which\nwill be held next year.\nOn the future of politics, Mr\nBrooke said he expected that the\nConservative Party would be setting\nthe agenda for many years to come.\nHe observed that, on at least five\noccasions since the war, the\nGovernment of the day has moved\ntowards the Oppostion and for esa ken its own ideas, and on each occasion\nthe Government of the day lost the\nnext general election. Mr Brooke said\nthat there was no possibility of the\npresent Conservative Government\nmoving towards the present\nOpposition.\nIn fact, he said, the reverse has\nbeen shown in the Kinnock-Hattersley\ndocument on the future of socialism,\nwhich Mr Brooke claimed uses\nlanguage normally associated with the\nConservative Party. He further added\nthat politicians, on the whole,\nunderestimate the importance of the\nintellectual tide which, he maintained\nwas still flowing in the Government's favour.\nNot surprisingly, the Chairman of\nthe Conservative Party was unwilling\nto comment on the parliamentary\nperformances of Paddy Ashdown and\nAlan Beith, who are leading\ncontenders for leadership of the\nDemocrats. He would go no further\nthan to say that they had different\nstyles and that the House had seen\nmore of Alan Beith, who has been in\nthe House of Commons for ten years\n(compared with Ashdown's five).\nI had been tipped off that Mr\nBrooke is involved with South\nAmerican archaeology, and he\ndescribed how he had become the\nChair of Trustees for a project to\nunearth an Inca settlement. His\ninterest stems from his study of\nAncient History at Balliol College,\nOxford, and from his late wife's connections with South America\n(where she grew up). Mr Brooke told\nme that the project has uncovered a major Inca settlement on the trail\nbetween Guzco and the last stand on\nthe Incas' Machu-Picchu, as well as\nconducting an ecological survey of the\narea.\nAt the end of the interview, when\nsubjected to some student enterprise,\nMr Brooke agreed to purchase a( blue) FELIX sweatshirt (although at\nthe reduced rate of \u00a36.16, which was\nall the change he had with him).\nFELIX would like to thank Mr\nBrooke for agreeing to this interview\nand giving up his valuable time.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198865 "

    "content": "In the nineteen\neighties we have\nbeen bombarded\nwith scare stories\nabout the food and\ndrink we consume.\nThe American\nscientists tell us\nthat sac car in gives\nus cancer while the\nFrench recommend\nthat half the food\nwe eat should be in\nthe form of raw\nfruit and\nvegetables.\nEverything is\ncarcinogenic\nnowadays!\nIt's hard to know\nwhat we can eat.\nThe FELIX science\nteam brings you an\neasy-to-read guide\nto nutrition\nincluding a special\nsection on E numbers.\nIn the very near future all food\nproducers will be required by law to\nlist nutritional information on all\npackaging of processed food. This\nstep has finally been taken following\nintensive lobbying of MPs by\ndieticians, doctors and medical\ncommittees, who believe that\nconsumers should be given more\ninformation about what they are\neating. As well as the pressure from\nthe 'informed' there has also been\npressure from the 'uninformed' who\nhave heard about additives,\ncarcinogen es and fibre and want to\nunderstand more in order to live a healthier life.\nThe new nutritional details on each\npacket will give figures for energy,\nprotein, carbohydrates, fibre and fat\nper lOO g serving (or 100ml in the case\nof fluids). Some may even give the\nadditional information on minerals\nand vitamins that the product\ncontains.\nEnergy alcohol provides 29 kilojoule s and a pint of beer contains approximately\n18g of alcohol.\nThe energy value of each type of\nfood will depend on the relative\nproportions of protein, carbohydrate,\nfat and alcohol.\nA person's requirement for energy\nwill vary depending upon sex, body\nsize, age, climate, activity, type of job\nand metabolic rate. The DHSS\nrecommends that for an 'ideal' body\nweight the average woman should\ntake 8000 kilojoule s a day and the\naverage man about 10,000 kilojoule s a day.\norigin including cereals, fruit,\nvegetables, seeds and pulses. Fibre is\ncontained in the cell walls of plants,\ngiving structural support to the plant.\nThe greatest concentration of fibre\nis found in the skin of a plant, such\nas potato skins and wheat bran.\nFibre values are quite often\ndepleted when the plant is cooked,\nprocessed or refined which is why\napple sauce contains less fibre than a fresh apple and apple juice contains\nno dietary fibre whatsoever.\nFibre is not digested but aids the\nprocess of digestion. Because it\nprovides no vital constituents to the\nbody, fibre was previously\ndisregarded by dieticians, it has\nhowever become the bi word of the\nNineteen Eighties due to research\nwhich has shown that it may play an\nimportant role in the prevention of\n'western diseases' such as bowel\ncancer, diabetes mellitus, varicose\nveins, piles and constipation.\nThere are two categories of fibre:\nsoluble and insoluble. Most plants\ncontain both sorts although\nproportions vary depending on the\ntype of food.\nInsoluble fibre is found in cereals\nand fibrous vegetables. It is this type\nof fibre which assists the passage of\nfoods through the body. It absorbs\nwater and acts as a bulking agent in\nthe stomach. This fibre increases the\nrate at which food passes through the\nintestines and, at the same time, it\nremoves any toxic substances from\nthe body more quickly.\nSoluble fibre is present in most fruit\nand vegetables.\nBeans and lentils are particularly\nrich in this type of fibre. Soluble fibre\ndelays the rate of absorption of\nnutrients from food. It does this by\nforming a gel which makes the food\ntravel more slowly through the body.\nA major benefit of soluble fibre is\nthat it delays the uptake of sugar by\nthe bloodstream which is why\ndiabetics have to stick to a fibre rich\ndiet. It maintains a constant blood\nsugar level which reduces hunger\npains.\nAs every good scientist knows,\nenergy cannot be created nor\ndestroyed. It can instead be converted\nfrom one form to another. The energy\nobtained from our food is used in\nseveral ways: converted to heat to\nkeep the body temperature constant,\nfacilitating breathing and pumping\nbipod, and replacing blood cells and\nbody tissues.\nThe energy value of a food is\nworked out by calculating the energy\nobtained from the protein,\ncarbohydrate and fat contents. Agram me of protein provides 17\nkilojoule s, agram me of carbohydrate\nprovides 16 kilojoule s and agram me of fat provides 37 kilojoule s. Vitamins and minerals usually\nprovide negligible energy. Dietary\nfibre is not absorbed into the body,\nso it also gives no energy. It is\nimportant to remember, if you are\nwatching your weight, that alcohol\nalso provides energy. Agram me of\n/ Totem Protein is the nutrient which we\nrequire in our daily diet for growth\nand repair of tissue and also for the\nmaintenance of normal everyday body\nfunctions.\nCarbohydrates Carbohydrates include both sugars\nand starches and their main function\nis to provide us with a source of\nenergy.\nfibre Dietary fibre, previously named\nroughage, is a form of carbohydrate\nnaturally present in foods of plant\n56 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

I am sure that\nit will continue to be an attractor of\nthe highest talents.\nHow about the impact of the\nprivatisation on our research? Here\nthere is a snag. The Government\nwould like to see industry pick up the\ntabs. Industry is not yet persuaded that\nth\nat is what they sould do. We are\npiggy in the middle. I believe that\nindustry is gradually recognising that\nthey will have to do more for, and\nwith the universities; that the flow of\ntalented graduates\u2014their lifeblood\u2014\nwill falter if they do not support the\nuniversity structure. They will\nsupport research. But here there is a further problem: Will they exert\nundue influence on what we research?\nWill they emphasise the applied, and\nperhaps even the mundane, at the\nexpense of the fundamental and the\nstrategic? The danger is certainly\nthere\u2014and must be countered. I regard the defence of fundamental\nwork as one of the key responsibilities\nwhich I. and my successors in the\nRectorship, must shoulder.\nPerhaps the biggest single problem\nfacing the College is that of student\nhousing. The College has a lot of\nresidential accommodation\u2014but not\nnearly enough. I believe that the\nsolution to this problem is absolutely\nkey to the future viability of the\nCollege. We are working on a number of possibilities, some of a fairly radical nature. The rents in\n'new' accommodation may have to be\neven higher than those charged\ncurrently for existing\naccommodation. That is bad\u2014but not\nas bad as having nothing to offer to\nstudents other than the address of the\nlocal estate agent...\nI have heard the suggestion made\nthat we should not stu gg le too hard\nin finding more accommodation in a part of the country where it is quite\nso difficult. Why not sell the joint,\nand move to a green field site,\nperhaps even going North of\nWatford? There is in fact a minor\npractical snag in this plan\u2014we do not\nown most of the territory on which\nwe sit...But even if we did, 1 believe\nit would be the wrong route for\nImperial College. True, the rents in\nLondon are high (incidentally nothing\nelse is\u2014most other things that we\nneed are cheaper in London than in\nthe rest of the country). But then we\nare also within walking distance of the\ntheatre and music capital of the world.\nLondon is an exciting place to be\u2014\nfor everyone with interests in\nperforming arts, in fine arts. It is also\nclose to Westminster\u2014giving us a measure of visibility which we might\napplaud or deplore\u2014but which\ncertainly makes the College very\ndifferent from what it would be were\nit located elsewhere.\nImperial College is unique. Starting\nin 1988 one would probably not\ndesign it the way it is, but it is where\nit is; having the particular mixture of\ndisciplines that we have. I am glad\nthat we did not start it in 1988.\nEric A Ash.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd1988 "

    "content": "counsel or procure' the suicide of\nanother person.\nThe laws on suicide are of\nparticular concern to life insurance\ncompanies. These are guided by the\nlaw that one cannot benefit from a crime. Thus as long as suicide\nremained a crime no payments were\nmade to beneficiaries. Now unless it\ncan be proved that the policy was\ntaken out with a view to profit,\npayment is made.\nVariations\nDespite the uncertainties about the\nphenomenon, several correlations\nhave been made. Religious\ndevoutness seems to show a close\ncorrelation with a low suicide rate\nwhen figures for different countries\nare compared. Exceptions are Austria\nand Hungary, both staunchly Roman\nCatholic yet both with suicide rates\namong the top five in the world\naccording to a1968 World Health\nOrganisation report. High suicide\nrates also exist in West Berlin and\nSweden, while the UK is in the lower\npart of the range for European\ncountries. Factors which might\ninfluence the figures include the age\ndistribution in the population\u2014the\nsuicide rate seems related to age,\ntending to increase for older people.\nAnother curious pattern is the\nseasonal variation. Suicides are more\nfrequent during Spring\u2014April, May\nand June in the northern hemisphere.\nSocial class is another factor\nappearing to influence the suicide\nrate, with unskilled workers and\nprofessionals, being most at risk, as\ncompared with lower rates among\nskilled and semi-skilled workers.\nStudents and doctors are particularly\nhigh risk groups.\nThe vulnerability of students is\nprobably due to the competitive\nnature of degree courses, and the lack\nof structure in a student's personal\nlife. The high rate of suicide in this\ngroup has led to several studies\ncomparing universities. Oxford and\nCambridge showed by far the highest\nrates among British universities.\nSocial structure is a definite factor.\nIsolation makes people more\nvulnerable; and a study by Cresswell\nand Smith showed a correlation\nbetween the suicide rate and the\nmale/female ratio at a university. The\nhigher the ratio, the more suicides\noccured, especially when the\nimbalance could not be rectified by\nmixing with people outside the\nuniversity itself. The ratio at which\nthe suicide rate should be lowest was\ncalculated at 2.5:1. There have been\nsuicide attempts in IC halls of\nresidence, but the incidence seems to\nbe no higher here than anywhere else.\nThe majority of people committing\nsuicide are male, though the gap\nbetween the figures for men and\nwomen has been decreasing.\nHowever, relatively more women\nseem to attempt suicide. The most\ncommon explanation given is that\nmen tend to use more dangerous\nmethods than women\u2014though\npoisoning (including use of gas,\naspirin or narcotic drugs) was most\ncommon for both sexes, a greater\nproportion of men used hanging or\nother fatally wounding methods. If\nEngland and Wales, 1\n9\n6\n0\n-1\n9\n7\n3\nRates per 1\n0\n0\n,\n0\n0\n0\n1\n5\n1\n0\n0\nAr \u2022\n\\\\\\ su cid ;sr|;1.> \u2022\n-si as jiM \u2022it\nedi\nem:i iw ica s nd\n\u2022\n*\n5j? \u2022 II0 the rss\" HA A ing ng\n\u00bb\u00bb *'\ns Al\\\n\"HA A ing ng %\n>\n\\\nHow people commit suicide\nthis reason is valid, one would expect\nthe total number of suicidal acts, fatal\nand non-fatal, to be the same for both\nsexes. Yet the total number of such\nacts is greater for women. A plausible\nreason seems to be that women may\nuse the 'appeal' value of the act more\nfrequently than men, who have other\nmeans of exerting pressure on the\nenvironment\u2014muscular power for\nexample.\nThis 'appeal' is effective in some\ncases. People's attitudes to the victim\nmay change so that conditions are\nbetter. On the other hand a suicide\nattempt may break up an already\nshaky relationship.\nNow What?\nThere are difficulties with treating\npeople who have attempted suicide.\nHospital treatment may cause\nproblems with the stigma of mental\nillness and difficulty with staff\nattitudes, and many patients are\ndischarged after forty-eight hours.\nThey often return to conditions\nsimilar to those leading to the attempt\nin the first place. The preferred\nmethod of aftercare, psychotherapy,\nis often refused by the patient.\nFollow-up studies, however, seem to\nshow that relatively few people who\nattempt suicide actually kill\nthemselves later, the dangerous\nperiod being the first few years after\nan attempt.\nThe statistical data seems to show\nthat suicide is inevitable. But when\none looks at individual cases, one\nfeels that almost all could have been\nprevented. Though most suicides\ncome as a shock to relatives and\nothers, it is often found that some\nwarning has been given, whether a deliberate threat of self-destruction or\nmerely the expression of a wish to be\ndead. So the belief that those who\nthreaten suicide do not carry it out is\na dangerous misconception. Various\norganisations exist to try to help\npeople before they reach the point of\nattempting suicide: The Samaritans\nare probably best known. Around\nCollege people to talk to include\nNightline, the doctors, and\ndepartmental tutors.\nSuicide is a strange phenomenon.\nWhilst being a very personal act it has\ngreat social causes and consequences.\nThough the rate of suicide among the\nmentally ill is 74 times that of the\ngeneral population, a decision to kill\noneself can be a perfectly rational\none. Is war suicide, for it certainly\ninvolves deliberate acts likely to end\nin death? This whole article seems\nrather morbid and while writing it I quite often got the impression I was\nperhaps doing something I shouldn't, but to ignore suicide would be to turn\nyour back on the utter despair of\npeople in perhaps the worst moments\nanybody could face, and why should\none treat them like that?\nA scene from 'Colonel Redl'\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198833 "

    "content": "UNDER MICRO\nby Steve Black\nSo, what is\nscience, anyway?\nScientists are often sure they know the\nanswer to this question, since, after\nall. science is what they do for a living. However, when they are faced\nwith the problem of actually defining\nwhat science is, or the problem of\ndistinguishing between science and\nnon-science, then they often find\nthemselves at a loss for words. In\nsome ways doing science is a substitute for thinking about it: so,\nwhen it comes to the crunch, many\nscientists find that they have not\nactually given much thought to what\nthey spend their lives doing.\nIt has been argued that the\nphilosophy of science (that is\nquestions about the nature of science)\nis irrelevant to scientists and should\nbe relegated to the arts where it is the\ndone thing to spend endless hours in\nfrenetic debate about subjects of no\nrelevance whatsoever. Most scientists\nseem to be getting on quite well in\ntheir day-to-day work without having\na detailed philosophy of their subject.\nSo why bother?\nThe first, and probably the best,\nreason for thinking about the nature\nof science is that if we knew what we\nwere doing we might be able to do it\nbetter. A good philosophy of science\nwould contain a sort of general\nprocedure for doing , good\nexperiments. By 'good experiment' I mean one that advances knowledge as\nefficiently as possible: a bad\nexperiment wastes time and effort\nwithout really telling us anything\nnew. Another good reason is that a clear philosophy of science may help\nus to avoid the misuse of the results\nof science: without a clear idea of the\nlimits of science we cannot guard\nourselves against cults of pseudoscientific un reason. A good\nphilosophy should help us to\ndistinguish what is scientific from\nwhat is not (though the dividing line\nmay be more or less fuzzy).\nThe naive view\nIt is a common misconception among\nthe public (and even among scientists)\nthat science is a dull subject that\nconcerns itself solely with the pursuit\nof stark-naked facts. Science,\naccording to this theory, has no room\nfor subjective feelings, imagination or\ncreativity. Science is about facts and\nfacts are objective. All we have to do\nis to make the right observations and\nwe will all agree on what they mean\nand on what theory explains them.\nScience is but a glorified form of\nstamp-collecting.\nAnyone, who knows any history\nknows that this view is a load of\ndingo's kidneys. Science has simply\nnever been that boring. Great\nscientists have (more often than not)\ncome up with their theories in\nmoments of inspiration and then spent\nyears trying to find the experimental\nproofs. In other cases the evidence has\nsat around being ignored because if\nanyone had cared to look then their\ntheory would have been seen to be\nwrong. Einstein and Dirac wanted\ntheir theories to be beautiful (in\nmathematical terms); Kekulefirstsaw\nthe structure of benzene in a dream\n(though the evidence had been staring\nhim in the face for years); Millikan\ndeliberately ignored results\nsuggesting fractional charges on the\nelectron. Good theories require\ninspired scientists, they will not\nsimply be forced on us by the facts.\nMany people seem to be greatly\nupset when it is suggested that the\nprocess of scientific discovery is not\ncompletely logical (progressing from\nexperiments to facts to theories to\ntruth). A lot of chemists wrote to\nChemical and Engineering News after\nan article about Kekule's dream to\ncomplain that such a view of scientific\ndiscovery (that is, scientific advance\nrelies on intuition and creativity)\nundermined the public's faith in\nscience. If scientific discovery is not\ncompletely logical, then how can we\ntrust its results?\nIt is possible to argue that science\nis essentially a process involved with\nuncovering true facts about the real\nworld. Indeed, when scientists speak,\nthey are often regarded as semi-religious sources of 'the truth about\nthe world'. However, scientists\nactually spend much of their time\ndisagreeing with each other, and this\nwould not happen in a world where\ntruth was always as obvious as some\npeople want it to be. And there is\nanother problem: some of the\nprevailing scientific views about the\nultimate nature of things actually\nchallenge any simplistic view of the\nconcrete nature of reality. Quantum\nmechanics imposes fundamental\nlimits on knowledge, and insists that\neven what we do know is so weird\nthat we don't really understand it.\nA critical view of\nreality\nThe big problem with naive realist\nviews of reality is that they make all\nobservations equal. Science, if it is to\nsort the wheat from the chaff, needs\nsome way to distinguish between\nrelevant observations and irrelevant\nobservations. Unfortunately, any\nattempt to make such distinctions\nmakes science less realist and makes\nthe truth more distant.\nKarl Popper introduced philosophy\nof science that puts theories ahead of\nobservations. In his system the job of\nthe scientist is first to construct good\ntheories (the theories will suggest\nwhich experiments are necessary) and\nthen to do the critical experiments.\nThe theories can come from anywhere\n(the subconscious, the logical mind,\nan acid trip) and their validity is\nindependent of their source. Good\nscience actually needs a constant input\nof creative ideas from somewhere.\nThe quality of a the pry is measured\nby its falsifiability. Some people find\nthis a completely counter intuitive demand (and many people Completely\nmisunderstood it). What Popper is\ndemanding is that there should be, in\nprinciple, some clear experimental\nway to prove a theory wrong.\nTheories which invoke things that can\nnever be observed. (for example:\npeople can only exhibit -psychic,\npowers in the presence of be fj ever s. and never when s be pt its are pre sen fc or internal combustion engines are\nrun by little green men who disappear\nwhen you open the bonnet) must-be\ntreated with some caution. The best\ntheories are those that are easy to\nrefute, but have not been refuted: they\nhave survived the fire of experimental\ntest.\nHowever, in this view, no theory\nis ever absolutely true. The best a theory can be is not yet refuted.\nScience is no longer the search for\ntruth, but just a search for better\ntheories. A clear distinction is drawn\nbetween theory and reality. All our\ntheories are but mental models which\nmore or less fit the (acts BOW, but\nwhich may well he completely invalid\nin the light of tomorrow's experiments.\nConsider the difference between\nNewton's theory of gravity and\nEinstein's. In certain experiments\nthey predict very similar results but\nin the critical experiments in extreme\nconditions (for example the bending\nof light under gravity) Einstein wins.\nBut the basic assumptions of\nNewton's model of the world are\nWhat it takes to be a good scientist.\n26 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Features\nCollege auditors Deloitte, Hoskins\nand Sells had prepared a report on the\nCollege Finance Section. The report\ndescribed the section as 'working in\nan environment of continual crisis\nwithout adequate computer systems or\nsufficient experienced staff. The\nCollege installed a new accounting\npackage last summer, but subsequent\n'ad hoc' modifications have made it\nimpossible to use the manufacturer's knowledge to solve any problems\nwhich arise in it.\nSome bills have been outstanding\nfor six months and it has been\nreported that suppliers' refusals to\ndeliver has forced Refectories to send\nout runners with manually-drawn\ncheques every day.\nThe auditors' report recommended\nthe installation of a completely new\naccounting package and suggested\nthat 'outside assistance' may be\nneeded to get the accounts ready by\nthe end of the year. It was also\nremarked that the finance section\nappeared to be over staffed.\nAs the FELIX news story put it, 'It\nis unknown...how much the recent\nevents have cost the College.' This\nmoney will have to be found from\nsomewhere\u2014but as the College is\nreputed to be \u00a33 million in debt, it is\nunclear from quite where.\nIn the same issue of FELIX, it was\nrevealed the President (now called\nSydney Harbour-Bridge) had called in\nthe police over a 'large loss' made by\nthe Bar and Snack Bar during the\nprevious year.\nThe following week a FELIX\nflysheet was produced to report on the\nsuspension of the Snack Bar's Manager and Assistant. The gross\nprofit deficit in the previous nine\nmonths of trading was thought to be\n\u00a335,000 from the Snack Bar and\n\u00a36,000 from the Bar. The losses had\nbeen discovered when the new Union\nFinance Officer began to examine the\ntrading outlet's books. In previous\nyears no accounts had been available\nuntil the annual return of the books\nby College, making profit/loss\nanalysis extremely difficult. As this\nreview is being written there have\nbeen no charges brought against\nanyone and nobody has a clue where\nthe money's gone.\n'Wherever I lay my\nhat, that's my\nhome'\nThere has been very little good news\nabout accommodation this year.

In previous years the\ndeadline has not been rigidly enforced\nand the Union organised a crash pad\nfor students caught by surprise.\nTen students' who had been\nallocated College places over the\nsummer were shocked to discover that\ntheir rooms had been double booked.\nSix were sups e que ntl y offered\nalternative accommodation. The\nstudents were told of the problem\nthree days before they were due to\nmove in, and others were given less\nthan a week's notice that their\napplications had been turned down.\nA decision taken by the Student\nResidence Committee prompted the\nUnion to colour-code Union cards\naccording to Hall of Residence. The\ncards were intended to help a security\nguard checking the identity of\neveryone who entered. However, the\nsecurity scheme was postponed for a year, in order to discover whether the\n\u2022 1\nHowgate discovered drinking \u00a36000 worth of Castlemaine XXXX!\ncolour-coded cards were feasible.\nNinety-seven first years were\nallocated places in Hamlet Gardens\nthis year, although there were only\nninety-two places available. It was not\nthought that this overbooking would\nbe a problem, since there are always\nun taken places. However, Subwarden\nChris Griffin said that he felt that the\naccommodation and social life of\nHamlet Gardens was unsuitable for\nfirst years many of whom had just left\nhome.\nSome of these students moved into\nflats which had not yet been\nredecorated after the damage inflicted\nby summer guests. The majority of\nthe trouble had been caused by\nstudents of a university in Eire.\nDespite the repairs, one flat was later\nrudely disturbed by the collapse of a shower ceiling.\nThe academic year also started with\na 'shake up' in the Accommodation\nOffice. The then Assistant College\nSecretary, Michael Arthur, took over\ntemporarily when the\nAccommodation Officer Lesley\nGillingham was moved to the Finance\nSection.\nRag Week brought the\nannouncement that 160 head ten nancy places would be lost next year. The\nlease on the '220' Hamlet Gardens\nblock (which contains about 130\nstudent places) as well as that on thirty\nplaces in 8 Earl's Court Square, will\nnot be renewed. In anticipation of this\nevent, a new block of twenty, four-student flats was taken on in Hamlet\nlast year but this still left a shortfall\nof fifty places.\nIn January, angry students\ninformed FELIX that some valuable\npersonal possessions had been sold in\nthe Linstead Basement Sale on 5th December. Linstead basement is the\nonly area in College where students\ncan leave their belongings over a long\nperiod, but the Hall Committee felt\nit should be cleared of the\naccumulation of unmarked items.\nThree notices were apparently put in\nFELIX, advertising the sale and\nwarning students to remove\nun labelled possessions. The sale\nraised over \u00a31100, which was split\nbetween the Hall's20 th birthday party\nand the RNLI. Clothes found in\nun labelled boxes were given to\nOxfam, other un labelled items which\ncould not be sold were thrown away.\nAfter the sale, however, people\nwho claim to have labelled their\nbelongings discovered that they had\nbeen included in the sale. One woman\nsaid she had lost ski equipment worth\n\u00a33,000; others claim that their records\nand lab books amongst other things\nhave disappeared. The Warden\napologised for the losses but the hall\nconvenor commented that he felt that\npeople who had lost possessions had\nnot taken adequate care of them and\nNEWS REVIEW FELIX Wednesday June 22nd198819 "

    "content": "interviewed for FELIX by Bill Goodwin\nHave you enjoyed your year as\nPresident?\nYes. I'd do it again any day. At the\nstart of the year I didn't know quite\nhow much I could achieve and at the\nend of it I feel I have achieved a satisfactory amount. The last term has\nbeen quite disappointing from that\npoint of view, because we have been\ntrying to hold the Union together\nrather than develop it.\nWhat do you think your most\nsignificant achievement has been?\nProbably the reorganisation of the\nStudent Union. The new structure is\ngoing to mean a lot in the future. The\ninstigation of the Hon Sec (Events)\ncould aid social life at the College and\ndevelop the Union from the students'\npoint of view. It's something we have\nneeded for a long time.\nCould you tell me about the liaison\ncommittee which has been set up\nbet\u00abten the Union and Industry ?\nThis is something we're still looking\ninto. But what I have envisaged, and\nin discussions with the Industrial\nSociety and the Careers Service, we\nhave come up with a formula which\nworks a bit like this; the Industrial\nRelations Sub-Committee goes out\nand organises a number of events\nrelated to industry to bring in some\nincome from them for their support\nof those events and at the same time\nhelp students find jobs through\nadvertising and promotions within\nCollege. We hope to produce a booklet of student activities that we\ncan sen ci out to industry, showing\nthem that we are interested in industry\nand showing them how they can help\nLast year the Union was involved\nJ in a number of student welfare\ncampaigns, for example the\ncampaign on Aids and Human\nRights week. Why do you think the\nUnion has been less active on this\nfront this year?\nI think that's directly my fault. It's a specific part of my job. Christine Oast\nyear's president) concentrated on\nthose things very heavily. I concentrated this year on setting up\na system so that people would be able\nto have enough time free to be able\nto do that to the extent that I could\nnever have achieved it and to a far\nfuller extent than Christine could have\nachieved it. I must admit wholeheartedly that my activity in welfare\nhas not been good this year, which is\nsad for me because I really do believe\nin student welfare.\nHow does the Union plan to invest\nthe three million pounds from\nHarlington Gravel?\nMy God, you hit on something there!\nI doubt that the money will be\ninvested. The plan at the moment is\nto spend the money on a new sports\nhall. The sad thing about the sports\nhall is that it is desperately needed.\nIt could provide a very good facility\nfor the students here on campus, but\nthe amount of income it will bring in\nto support the fund is very limited.\nThere are a number of other projects\nwhich are in the pipeline which are\nmore luxury facilities than necessity\nfacilities, but at the same time they\ncould generate a quantity of income\nto support the system. One of them\nis an astroturf sports pitch which can\nbe used for tennis, football training\nor hockey. There's the possibility of\na bowling alley. That would bring\nmoney in in many different ways.\nFeasibility studies on it show it to be\nprofitable, with a five year pay-off\nperiod and the ability to keep prices\nlow for students. The other major\n7 did it\nmy way\nThe Harbour Bridge\nInterview\nthing that the money from Harlington\ncould be used for is a sports manager;\nsomeone who would coordinate the\nuse of the facilities we have plus\ncoaching for clubs and societies. The\nfurther possibility is a leisure centre\nwith Jacuzzis and saunas and that sort\nof thing. The feasibility study has yet\nto be carried out but it looks\npromising.\nDo you think the Union has done\nenough to fight the forthcoming\nincreases in accommodation\ncharges?\nThe Union has been very active in\nattempting to help the Residence\naccount sustain itself and continue to\nrun. The situation is that there are two\nblocks of College which cannot\noperate on a University Grants\nCommittee funding. All the rest of\nCollege gets money from the UGC.\nThe two blocks are the refectories and\nthe halls of residence. They have to\nbe independently self-financing,\nwhich means that if we purchase\naccommodation, we have to find the money to pay for it. Now,\naccommodation and housing costs in\nLondon are extremely high, and there\nis no way that we can purchase new\naccommodation without increasing\nthe rents across the whole system.\nThis is why I was so opposed to the\npurchase of Fisher Hall at all last\nyear, because-I knew it would cause\na dramatic increase in rents. Christine\nTaig tied our hands to that last year\nand there was very little I could do\nabout it. The only way we can\nactually sort the system out is to make\nthe Conference Office capable of\nbringing in more money from outside\nletting, and that may mean a reorganisation. Unless we can get\nmore money in, the residence system\nis going to continue to find itself in\nmore and more difficult positions.\nWhich of the College\nadministrators do you admire the\nmost, and why?\nJohn Smith, the College Secretary.\nBecause when you go to him and you\nsuggest something to him, he sees you\nat short notice, he listens to what you\nhave to say. If he likes it, he tells you\nhe likes it; if he doesn't like it, he tells\nyou he doesn't like it. You know\nwhere you stand. If he likes it he gives\nyou his support, and you get it done.\nIf he doesn't like it then you know you\nhave to try and find some way to get\nround the bugger. But you know\nwhere you stand with him. He's a clever man.\nYou've recently been elected\nChairman of Publications Board.\nWhat are your plans for next year?\nI'm very keen to start kicking a few\nof the publications into shape, mainly\nthe electronic ones that need a lot of\nencouragement to kick-start them\nonto the way to real expansion. I think\ninput from outside organisations can\nreally help those two specific media\nand I think if those two could actually\nbe expanded and improved we could\nsee a great development in them.\nAs far as the publications such as\nFELIX and the Handbook are\nconcerned, I think I can add a lot\nmore on the side of gaining more\nsponsorship and advertisement in\nsome of those areas. I don't want\nreally to have anything to do with the\nideals of what goes in them and what\ndoesn't go in them. But I would like\nto help them get going and get more\nmoney coming in for them and\nsupporting them better.\nHow do you intend to help the\npublications gain more ?\nI think a more direct link between\nImperial College Union and industry\nthrough such things as the Industrial\n12 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Rev i \u00a3MMJL\nShy People (Cert 15)\nA New York journalist, Diana\nSullivan (Jill Clayburgh) decides to\nbreak away from her hectic lifestyle\nand heads for a simpler environment,\naccompanied by her flighty 15 year-old daughter, Grace. She decides to\nresearch her family genealogy, which\nleads her to the swamps of Louisiana,\nwhere her uncle, Joe Sullivan used to\nlive. They move in with Ruth Sullivan\n(Barbara Hershey), Joe's widowed\nwife and her three sons. These are the\n'Shy People' referred to in the title\nand are so called because they shun\ncivilisation and live in a squalid house\nin the marshes which is accessible\nonly by boat.\nIt is clear from the start that these\nare not the usual simple country folk,\nand that life in the backwoods isn't as idyllic as one would have thought.\nThe mother is a tough, bitter woman,\nruling over her children through fear,\na trait she seems to have inherited\nfrom the dead husband. She lives in\nher own world, with her own laws.\nShe deals out her own idea of justice.\nFor example, she suspects a man of\npoaching and so goes into town and\nshoots him. Of her three sons, one is\nprone to violence, one is mentally\nretarded and the other locked up in\na cage so that he can't run off to the\noutside world.\nThere are two central themes\nrunning through this film. The first\nis a clashing of cultures; city slicks\nmeet country bumpkins. This theme\nis dealt with in the scenes featuring\nthe kids. Grace, the 'hip' city kid,\nattempts to subvert the sons by filling\ntheir heads with the teenage ideals of\nrebellion and individuality, and\nintroduces them to the wonders of the\nwalkman, drugs and sex. Eventually\nit is she who suffers from their loss\nof innocence.\nThe second theme is the effect that\nJoe Sullivan has on the family. The\nman was supposed to have died fifteen\nyears before, but his family refuse to\nacknowledge his death and still live\nin fear of him. It is he who seems to\ncontrol their lives. It is not made clear\nin the film whether Joe is actually\nalive or whether his ghost haunts the\nswamps. From time to time we see\na sinister silhouette figure in the mists\nand for a film like this to take on a supernatural twist seems silly.\nThe film holds our interest for the\nmost part due to the complexity and\ncharacter of the family and mysterious\nlock that the, apparently deceased, Joe\nhas on it. But after a while things just\nget silly and confusing. Any message\nthat this film has is lost in the\nmelodrama. In the end both parties\nsuffer but also learn from the presence\nof the other; the journalist is brought\ncloser to her daughter, and Joe's widow realises that she cannot keep\nher sons as virtual prisoners any\nlonger.\nThe acting in this film is good all\nround, especially Barbara Hershey\n(Hannah and Her Sisters, The Tin\nMen), as the tough Ruth Sullivan. The\nphotography is also commendable.\nOften the narrative is interrupted with\nsome beautiful shots of the\nswampland.\nShy People is a curious, if\nsomewhat muddled film, but I can't recommend it as the type of film to\nfreak out to after the exams.\nSumit Guha.\nMUSIC\nPeople\nHothouse Flowers\nHow ironic it is that such remarkable\ntalent as the new Irish band Hothouse\nFlowers, should have grabbed the\nattention of the British record-buying\npublic via that atrocious annual\ndisplay of bad taste, the Eurovision\nSong Contest. Nevertheless, the sheer\nquality of their hit single Don't Go,\nhas allowed them to easily live that\ntacky episode down. Their much\nawaited debut album is no\ndisappointment either.\nThrough the plaintive vocals of lead\nsinger Liam O 'Maonlai, each and\nevery song grabs the attention. The\nwhole country now knows and loves\nDon't Go, but also listen out for the\ngospel-influenced I'm Sorry and It\nwill be Easier in the Morning. Echoes\nof Spring-teen and Van Morrison run\nthrough this album and there is some\nsuperb piano playing by O 'Maonlai.\nThe list of great songs seems\nendless\u2014buy this album for yourself\nand appreciate one of the best albums\nof the year so far.\nTracy Chapman\nTracy Chapman\nWith her single Fast Car rising\nsteadily up the charts, and a massive\nglobal audience witnessing her talents\nat the recent Mandela concert, Tracy\nChapman may prove to be one of the\nmore surprising successes of 1988.\nBeing a black folk singer will draw\ninevitable comparisons with Joan\nArmatrading, but her songs pack a stronger punch. Her debut album is\nan impressive collection of finely-crafted songs, Chapman's haunting\nvoice and intelligent lyrics being the\ncommon factors. Apart from Fast Car\na moving dream of escape from the\ntedium of life, Behind the Wall a haunting ac cappella track about wife-beating is the strongest track, and\nindeed Chapman is at her best in her\npolitical songs. Though her love\nsongs are also good, they lack the\nlyrical bits of the rest of the album.\nNevertheless, this is a confident debut\nalbum from a talented\nsinger-songwriter.\nLovesexy\nPrince\nDon't be deceived by the sleeve\u2014\ndespite the bold, provocative and\ndownright silly photograph of 'His\nPurpleness', this album falls well\nshort of being Prince's most daring\nwork to date. The exotic kaleidoscope\nof styles that marked Parade and Sign\nO' the Times seems to be non-existent, Prince opting only for the\nfunky grooves of his earlier work.\nThe cont a geo us, delicious funk of\nAlphabet St promised great things for\nthe album, but unfortunately only\nGlam Slam comes near it. Prince\nseems to have concentrated more on\nerotica than the actual music. Prince\nis normally quite capable of\ncombining sheer sexuality with great\nmusic, but somehow it doesn't quite\nhappen on this album.\nIt has to be said, nevertheless, that\nPrince is still well ahead of his rivals.\nBut it is when you consider that\nPrince has been one of the greatest\ninnovators and entertainers in popular\nmusic, that you realise what a disappointment this album is.\nSumit Guha\n72 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "LONDON RECRUITMENT FAIR\nSo, you've finally\ngot that well-earned\ndegree from\nImperial College!\nWhere do you go\nfrom here? Russ\nClark, head of the\nCollege Careers\nService takes a brief look at the\nLondon\nRecruitment Fair\nand how to find a job this Summer.\nIf it's Summer, it must be the London\nRecruitment Fair! There is no doubt\nthat this Fair is now firmly established\nas the most popular means for finding\na job after graduation. More and more\nstudents are waiting until the nail-biting, coffee-drinking and hand-sweating of Finals are over before\nmaking serious efforts to find\nemployment. That was the case for\n10,000 graduates who attended last\nyear and the numbers this year will\nprobably be even higher.\nBut what exactly is it? Well it's not\na lot different from the Industrial\nSociety's Careers Fair which many of\nyou will have attended last Autumn.\nThe third day in fact, will be devo'ed\nsolely to giving information to\npenultimate year students. Tijat may\nat least help you to visualise what it\nmight be like. There are a few\nimportant differences though and the\nfirst of these is size. There will be\nmore than 150 employers at the fair\non each of the three days\u2014which,\nincidentally, are 29th and 30th June,\nand 1st July. It is held at the Business\nDesign Centre in Islington, a huge\nbuilding which was once used to hold\nagricultural shows. It has recently\nbeen totally refurbished to provide\nexhibition facilities on a grand scale.\nThe second difference is the sheer\nvolume of people attending. If you've\nbeen to Petticoat Lane market on a Sunday morning you'll have some\nidea of just how busy it is. In fact,\nthe Fair is very much like a market.\nEmployees set up stalls and attempt\nto sell their tasty jobs to unsuspecting\nshoppers! The trouble is, they don't sell to everyone, only those who are\nwell-presented, well-informed, highly\nmotivated and who possess the range\nof qualities for which they are\nlooking.\nWhat can you do to make yourself\nmore attractive to them? First of all,\nyou should invest in some smart\nclothes, if you haven't already got\nsome. Second, you should do all you\ncan before the Fair to find out who\nwill be there, what sort of jobs they\nmay have on offer and which of these\nyou want to target on the day or days\nyou are there. You should then spend\nas much time as possible researching\nliterature, or at the least, their entry\nin the careers directory. Give some\nthought also to the qualities you think\nthey will be looking for and decide\nwhich of these you have. That will\nhelp you to sound a lot more\npersuasive when you face them at the\nFair. If you can present yourself to\nan employer and say in a few\nsentences that you have a range of\nqualities which you know will interest\nthem, you are clearly halfway there.\nThey will probably ask you for a CV\nor a completed Standard Application\nForm. You should therefore go to the\nFair armed with stocks of these. An\nSAF photocopied and backed onto A3\npaper can look indistinguishable from\nan original. You may, however, like\nto leave the section blank which asks\nyou to state which careers you are\nconsidering. This section requires a more personal touch than do the other\nsections and should be completed\nwhen you know more precisely what\noccupational areas you want to apply\nfor. It is particularly important to vary\nyour answer if you are applying for\ntotally different jobs! By the way, if\nyou think you could do with some\nadvice on how to complete application\nforms and how to interview well,\nthere will be seminars taking place to\nhelp you.\nIt is very important not to be overawed by the scale and busy-ness of\nthe Fair. It is very easy to just stand\nand watch\u2014rather like at a fun fair\nwhere you want to go on the most\nhair-raising ride but haven't got the\nnerve. Just get stuck in\u2014even if that\nmeans that your first few words seem\ntotally garbled. If you are really\nnervous\u2014go up to an employer you\nare not so interested in and break the\nice with them. The more people you\ntalk to, the more indifferent you\nshould become.\nFinally, in preparation for the Fair,\ndo use whatever facilities within the\nCollege Careers Advisory Service\nwhich you think might be helpful.\nYou could, for example, try a computer-assisted careers guidance\nprogramme, watch a video, read\nsome relevant reference literature or\nsimply pick up careers literature. You\ncould have a chat with a Careers\nAdviser; either in your department or\nin the Central Careers Office in\nSherfield if you want to iron out any\nproblems.\nDespite its size and popularity, the\nFair is not the only means of finding\na job. If you find yourself stuck\nafterwards, we will be glad to chat\nthrough the alternatives with you.\nRuss Clark,\nHead of College Careers Service.\n28 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 * ii.^ gT \u2014\nF~ EE l_I As AP Editor for the last academic\nyear (1986/87) I was criticised by\nsome members of the academic staff\nhere at IC. None, as far as I am\naware, were prepared to officially\ncomplain to me or to the Union on the\nsubject, but quite a few were prepared\nto tell me personally just what they\nthought of me and my work. At times\nI found this extremely distressing.\nThe fiasco which has surrounded\nthe production of a supplement to my\nAP has rubbed even more salt into the\nwound. It could be said that those who\ncomplained about the opinions\ncontained in my AP would now see\nmy work as tame in comparison with\nthe inaccurate rubbish written in the\nsupplement. However, whether or not\nthis clears my name it is quite likely\nto mean the death of a publication\nwhich I believe in and which I have\nfought for ever since I came to\nOPINION:\nTHE ALTERNATIVE PROSPECTUS UPDATE\nSunny Bains was last year's Alternative Prospectus Editor. She is studying\nfor a degree in the Physics Department and hopes to enter her third year\nnext year.\ncollege.\nThe AP is not a fun publication. It has\na negligible profile within College and\ngets little support from the Union\nhierarchy. It is almost unique in\nPublications Board in that it is the\nonly publication that is not intended\nto be primarily for consumption by\nIC students.\n' All this has the effect of making the\nAP editor's post an incredibly low\nstatus job, especially when compared\nto the Handbook editor, as well as\nbeing a very difficult one.\nThe Handbook editor has only to\ntell a fresher what delights await them\nin the following three years. The\nfresher has no decision to make. If the\nHandbook editor gets it wrong there\nare unlikely to be any serious\nrepercussions.\nOn the other hand if the AP Editor\ngets it wrong, not only do they risk\nfalsely enticing people to or repelling\npeople from IC, but they also risk\nbeing attacked by College.\nI still stand by my AP. If it was a bit on the negative side then perhaps\nthat is justified on the basis of\nbalancing the sycophantic Official\nProspectus. No one can argue that I did not work incredibly hard on the\nproject with only limited help from\nthe Union (with the notable exception\nof Christine Taig, last year's President and a very few Dep Reps).\nIt is very difficult to try to force Dep\nReps to write articles for you and to\nhave them checked etc without\nappearing to be too pushy.\nAnyway, back to the supplement.\nIf Martyn Peck spent almost no time\ndoing his job, and did the work he\ncompleted badly, then he should be\ncriticised for it. If the Union President\nsaw it before it was printed and\napproved it, then he should also be\ncriticised. But the main thing is that\nbecause of one or two people's incompetence, a good and useful\npublication should not be allowed to\nbe crushed by admissions tutors who\nhave finally found the excuse they\nneeded. If the AP Supplement Editor\nhad been given more advice, help and\nguidance by the Union, the present\ndifficulties'would never have arisen.\nMy feeling is that the Union would\nlike the buck to be passed to Martyn\nPeck and stop there. Were this to\nhappen, then the Alternative\nProspectus will not survive the attacks\nof the Admissions Tutors. 'If Maftyn\nPeck is to blame,' they will say 'then\nImperial College could held to ransom\nby any AP Editor with a grudge'.\nSunny Bains\nPIMLICO( October 19th'88 Feb 8th'89) Like a chance to communicate scientific\nideas and help teachers of Science and\nMaths in local ILEA Primary and Secondary\nschools?\nThen join the scheme and the student\nPimlico Connection Society...\nDetails from the Humanities Dept.\nRoom 313C, Mech Eng\nor\nRoom 501, Elec Eng\nSummer Vacation\nEmployment\nQueens Tower Guides\nThe Queens Tower will be open to the public again\nthis Summer not only to ensure that the College\nstays firmly on the map but hopefully to produce\na small additional income for the College.

Yet over\nhalf the stations you\ncan receive in the\nLondon area are\n'Pirates'-broadcasting without\na licence\u2014and\ntaxpayer's money is\nused to shut them\ndown. Why do we\nhave the radio we\ndo...and what\ndevelopments can we\nexpect in the next\nfew years?\nChris Martin, a National Officer of\nthe Community\nRadio Association\nand ex-Station\nManager of IC Radio\nviews the\ndevelopments.\nRadio was never intended for\n'broadcasting'\u2014the fact that more\nthan one person could receive a radio\ntransmission was considered a nuisance, when, in 1906, Lee De\nForest (pat enter of the Triode\u2014the\nfirst valve amplifier) began to\ntransmit live singing and records from\nhis New York laboratory, and, later,\nfrom the Eiffel Tower in France.\nThings didn't really get going until\nafter the 1914-18 war, when three\ncompletely different pressures\ncombined to set up a radio\nbroadcasting service\u2014the wireless at\nit was known.\nThe first pressure was from the\nmanufacturers of radio components\nduring the war\u2014as is often the case,\nmilitary needs and funding forced\nhuge developments in a short time,\nand during the war the technology in\nradio had developed considerably.\nNow the manufacturers of the new\nradio sets needed a market.\nSecond was the thousands of ex-servicemen who had built and used\nthe new wireless sets during the\nwar\u2014they were aware of the\npossibilities of a system of broadcast\nradio, and had the knowledge and\nexperience to make it work.\nThird, and most importantly, was\nthe pressure on governments to set up\na system of broadcasting that they\ncould control. 1917 had seen the\nBolshevik Revolution in Russia, with\nits aim of 'spreading world revolution\nby every means available', and the\nBritish authorities were terrified of\nanything that would encourage the\nspread of communism through war-ravaged Europe. In 1919 during the\nshort lived revolution in Germany, the\nSoldiers and Workers Council took\nover the military radio network to\nbroadcast 'to all', the state was deeply\nalarmed, and was under great\npressure to set up a system that it\ncontrolled.\nIt is interesting to compare the\ndifferent effects these pressures had\nin the USA and Britain. In the USA\nan attempt to give the state a monopoly over Radio failed, and\ninstead a commercial monopoly was\ngiven to the Radio Corporation of\nAmerica (RCA); a company made up\nfrom General Electric, Westinghouse,\nATT and United Fruit. They were the\nmanufactures of radio sets and it was\nhoped that, by providing programmes\npeople would like, they would buy the\nreceiving sets. The first stations were\nset up in 1920, and soon were\nappearing all over the USA, with the\nfirst radio advert being broadcast in\n1927. selling apartments on Long\nIsland.\nBack in the UK, things were\nmoving a lot slower, from the Spring\nof 1920, the Marconi Company\nbroadcast daily programmes from\nChelmsford\u2014but by the autumn\ncomplaints were coming from the\nmilitary about the 'frivolous' use of\nthe airwaves\u2014there were cases of\naeroplanes crashing when their\nlanding instructions were drowned by\n'musical evenings'.\nAn interesting quote comes from CA Lewis, organiser of programmes\nfor the BBC who wrote in 1924:\n' 'The question may well be asked why\nit was that Wireless Telegraphy did\nnot come into use in the Autumn of\n1920, when things were just\nbeginning to boom in America. The\nanswer lies in the sentence\u2014we are\nBritish. Let others rush at new\ninventions, do the experimenting,\nspend the money, take the hard\nknocks...but we British sit tight and\nlook before we leap. \"\nIn truth, the British Government\nwas far more worried about\n'subversive elements' taking over\nstations, and imposed a two year\nmorita rium on broadcasting\u2014the\npublic could hear concerts from Paris\nand The Hague, but the British\nairwaves were silent.\nPublic pressure was growing\nhowever, and in December 1921 '63\nwireless societies' handed in a petition, and the Marconi Company\nwas allowed to broadcast half an hour\nevery week; but with a break every\ntn ree minutes to listen for official\ntransmissions on that frequency!

Being the first\nfemale FELIX Editor has been no\nmean feat. The first sign of the new\nregime was a shocking reorganisation\nof the FELIX Office to make a cosy\ncoffee area, as well as a disturbing\ntidy ness as far as the eye could see.\nHowever, even one as macho as\n'Judith couldn't withstand the\nun tidying efforts of seasoned hacks\nfor long and by the second term she\nwas as messy as everyone else.\n'Big J' has built up a reputation as\na leader with an iron fist, terror ising those who dared to cross her. It\nwasn't always this way. Initially she\nwas fairly restrained, only growling\nat prospective photocopier users. But\nby the start of the second term,\nHackney's dictatorial tendencies were\nbeginning to emerge. Staff found her\nstanding on tables and chairs to shout\norders. She was soon brought back\ndown to Earth when Business\nManager Chris Martin launched a reel\nof masking tape at her sylph-like\nframe. The staff really noticed the\nchange in Judith around March when\nthe FELIX racing correspondent\nstarted making frequent trips to the\nOffice to ring race line.

Over the holiday, because\nHackney had no paper to bring out,\nshe started hitting the Southern\nComfort in unheard of quantities, not\nto mention the Dairy Milk chocolate.\nThis later proved to be her downfall.\nThe booze had obviously clouded her\nbrain and she hatched some jolly\nwacky ideas. One was to continually\nproduce copies of FELIX larger than\nanything attempted before. To collate\na forty-page special was bad enough,\nbut three weeks before the end of the\nSummer Term, the poor dear finally\nflipped, 'Hey gang, let's produce an\neighty-four-page last issue' she said.\nThis was a nightmare. Staff stayed\novernight in the Office in order to\nmeet deadlines and then spent about\na week collating the wretched thing,\nas Jude's great deal with an outside\nfirm of colla tors fell through.\nTempers frayed, arguments arose\u2014\nHackney was s lagged off day and\nnight.\nShe also had the idea of producing\na summer t shirt, the design of which\nwas to coincide with the front cover\nof the last issue. A design,\nincidentally which carried the faces\nof all her toy boys. This proved to be\na monumental cock-up\u2014the end result\nlooking like a five-year old's random\nexperiment with an airbrush.\nIn general, Judith has been an\nawkward Editor to work for:\ncontrary, moody, sometimes\nmiserable and especially bad-tempered when there are s prog s about. This year has not been\nuneventful.\nJoking aside, the past year has been\ntremendously good fun.

    "content": "Racing Form\nThere are two main types of racing\nform available to the punter. The one\nseen by most is that in the\nnewspapers. There is also more\ndetailed form carried in The Sporting\nLife and The Racing Post. As the\naccess that most students get is to that\nin the national press. I 'll give an\nexplanation here.\nShown is a race held at Sandown\nlast month. The header gives the time,\nname of the race and the distance it\nwill be run over. The final figure is\nthe prize money to the winner.\nThere is a separate line for each\nentry into the race. Four days before\nthe race, a race card number is\nassigned to each horse. This is the\nnumber in the very left hand column.\nIt dictates the order in which the\nhorses have been weighted (more on\nthat later). These numbers have a few\ngaps in them ie in the above example,\nnos 3. 11 and 12 are missing. This\nis because the horses carrying these\nnumbers have been withdrawn after\nthe four-day duration stage.\nThe next item on the race card is the\nhorses form. In the guide above, only\nthe previous six results are shown.\nThis varies from paper to paper. The\nnumber shown is the position the\nhorse finished in that particular\nrace\u2014the most recent being to the\nright. 'O' means that the horse did not\nfinish the first fence. A'' represents\nthe end of the racing season. Any\nentries to the left of '-' are for last\nseason. 7' represents the season\nbefore.\nIn addition, in steeplechase racing,\nother abbreviations are used:\nU \u2014Horse unseated rider\nP \u2014Rider pulled horse up\nF \u2014Horse fell at a fence\nR \u2014Horse refused to jump a fence.\nObviously, for flat racing (as above),\nthese are redundant abbreviations.\nFollowing the horses name, given\nin bold type, is a bracketed name.\nThis is the owner of the horse. This\ncan sometimes be a good pointer to\nany dod gy business going on in the\nrace.

Generally, the\nolder a horse gets, the more suited it\nis to longer trips. A short race, such\nas the Derby is for three-year-olds\nwhereas a long distance race such as\nThe Grand National is suited to nine\nor ten-year-olds.\nThe next two figures are the weight\nthat the horse is carrying in stones and\npounds. As a horse does better in\nsuccessive races, it is given a handicap, which is the figure shown.\nThis fluctuates according to a horse's form. The figure is the minimum\nweight that ther rider, saddle and\nbaggage can add up to. Obviously, a horse is going to run slightly slower\nif it is carrying a stone extra on its\nnext outing. It is this handicapping\nthat plays a key factor in the\npredicting the outcome of horse races.\nThe last name is that of the jockey.\nCertain jockeys are in form at\ndifferent times, but obviously can\nhave an off day. The jockey is an\napprentice and the figure given is the\njockey's allowance, i.e. how many\npounds less the jockey can carry\nbelow the official handicap.\nThe last figure is the draw number.\nWhen the four day declarations are\nmade, the names are put into a hat and\nthe draw is made. The order in which\nthey come out is the order in which\nthey will begin the race along the\nstarting line. This can be\nadvantageous on certain courses. A high draw is favoured on some, a middle or low on others.\nThere are a few other terms in the\nguide which need explaining. These\nare the ones after the mount's name:\nC \u2014Horse has previously\nwon on this course.\nD \u2014Horse has previously won\nover this distance.\nBF\u2014The horse has previously\nbeen beaten whilst\nstarting as a favourite.\n71b ex\u2014Horse has won in the\npast ten days and so has\na71b penalty added to its\nhandicap rating.\nGiven below the main body of form\nis the betting forecast. This is a list\nof the starting prices that the'\nnewspaper has predicted.\nFinally the number of horses that\nwill start the race is given.\nThe form guide shown from this\nparticular paper gives details of the\nlast meeting that each entry has been\nengaged in. For example, Sparky\nLad, carrying 7st71 b won, beating\nColway Rally into second place.\nColway Rally was carrying 9st101 b and was beaten by a neck at Lingfield\non May 21st. The official going was\nfirm to good and it was a seven\nfurlong race.\nOnce you've taken into account all\nthese factors, how do you select a winner?\nWell, ideally, if a horse repeats a race, carrying the same weight, with\nthe same going, same jockey etc., it\nshould complete the race in exactly\nthe same time. In practice, nothing\ncould be further from the truth. As\nwell as the fact that no two days are\nexactly the same, there is also a certain degree of monkey-business\nthat occurs in the racing world.\nVarious methods exist for\nattempting to predict which mount\nwill win a particular race. As a good\nrule of thumb, if a horse has run a particularity stunning race and at its\nnext outing it is carrying only slightly\nmore weight, then it is probably going\nto run another blinder. However,\nthe going might be different. For\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198835 "

    "content": "I was approached\nby a young woman\nwith a clipboard the\nother day. I'd seen\nsimilar young\npeople hovering\naround the subway\nentrance in\nExhibition Road but\nhad always\nmanaged to avoid\nbeing stopped by\nthem. She was very\ninsistent when I said that I didn't have the time to\nstop and talk to\nher. I agreed to\nanswer a few\nquestions. They\nwere all reasonably\nsimple, until the\nfinal set. Did I believe there was a god? Why not?\nWhat is your idea\nof an ideal world?\nDo you think that it\ncan be achieved?\nWould I like to\ncome for a free\nmeal and talk one\nnight this week?\u2014\nEh, no thanks, I'm very busy this\nweek.\nAfter a year at IC, it's a safe bet that\nyou've been approached at least once\nby someone offering you peace,\nfriendship and enlightenment. They\nask you a few questions, invite you\naround to their place for a meal, show\nyou a video and insist that you spend\na weekend with them in a country\nhouse with a few friends.\nFew people set out to join a cult and\nyet there are millions of people all\nover the world who have devoted\nthemselves to these new religions. It's a mistake to believe that it is the\nemotionally or intellectually crippled\nwho are particularly vulnerable.\nEveryone suffers from depression at\nsome time in their life. It is so easy\nto become overwhelmed because of\nstresses created by exam pressures,\nbroken relationships, loneliness and\nsocial group pressures. Cults promise\nsimple solutions to complex\nproblems. Their doctrines deal with\nintellectual doubts and emotional\nuncertainties, offering potential\nrecruits a new security to their lives.\nTactics The most popular method used in\nLondon today are the questionnaires\nor personality tests. One such cult are\nThe Scientologists, whose\nheadquarters are on Tottenham Court\nRoad.\nAlthough outlawed in many\nEuropean countries, the 'free\npersonality test' is still in evidence in\nLondon. Pedestrians in central\nLondon are asked to come off the\nstreet to answer around 200 questions\nto reveal their true personality.\nStrangely enough, almost everybody\nwho takes these tests is found to have\na personality deficiency. They are\ngiven pamphlets to read, offering a variety of expensive courses which\ncan 'enrich' your life.\nAnother popular way of recruiting\nis by backing a 'respectable'\norganisation. Narconon, a drug\nrehabilitation unit, is also run by The\nScientologists and has been much\ncriticised for the way it replaces drug\ndependence with cult dependence.\nThe EST (Erhard Seminar\nTraining) is behind The Hunger\nProject, whose aim is to stop world\nhunger by the year 2000. The\ncharity's links with the cult are not\nwidely known as the EST philosophy\ncontradicts that of THP. EST state:\n'We are How, What, and Where we\nare because that is what we chose.\nThere is no need to aid the sick and\nthe poor because they want to be what\nthey are.' It has been alleged recently\nthat most money has been channelled\nback into creating more publicity.\nSpotting a recruiter The Cult Information Centre have\nrecently published a leaflet called\nCults on Campus. Its emphasis is very\nmuch on avoiding being recruit t in\nthe first place:\ncu \u2022 QUESTION people with easy\nanswers to world problems.\n\u2022 QUESTION people who are\nexcessively friendly, as there are few\ninstant friendships.\n\u2022 QUESTION people with invitations\nto free meals and lectures, where the\nobjectives are not clearly stated-there may be a hidden agenda.\n\u2022 QUESTION people that pressure\nyou because 'everyone else is doing\nit'.\n\u2022QUESTION people that recruit you\nthrough guilt-induced by others, it is\nrarely a productive emotion.\n\u2022 QUESTION invitations to seminars\nor free weekends in the country.\nCIC are very quick to point out that\nrecruiters are not con artists\u2014'they\nare believers, which is what makes\nthem so convincing.'\nHelen's story Helen was a student at Aston\nUniversity. She was intelligent but\nadmits to being idealistic and\nspiritually curious. She was offered\na weekend in the country to help her\nstop smoking. She didn't know what\nto expect of the weekend and saw it\nas a bit of fun with a suitable goal.\nWhen she got to the house she met\na lot of friendly people who were all\nkeen to discuss 'life, the universe, and\neverything'. 'We all went around\nhugging and kissing each other and\ntalking about the ideal world.'\nThe intensive stop-smoking course\nbegan. 'They took our watches away,\ngave us long lectures which came to\nno conclusion, wouldn't let us go to\nsleep, shouted at us and made us feel\nguilty about ourselves. Not just\nbecause we were smokers, but\nbecause we didn't share their beliefs.'\n'After what seemed like days, but\nwas only just over 24 hours, they fed\nus and gave us our possessions back.\nIt was all hugging and kissing again.\nI felt really cleansed.'\nHelen's story is so similar to many\nstudents'. She was approached soon\nafter she had moved away from\nhome. T felt good after the weekend.\nI felt part of something, like I'd really\nachieved so em thing and met a lot of\nlovely people.'\nTS THE CULTS\nThe Church of Scientology The Scientologists was founded in\n1951 by L Ron Hubbard, the science\nfiction writer. They claim to have a worldwide membership of 6 million.\nTheir doctrine is 'dianetics', a type\nof psycho-analysis which offers\nmembers 'total freedom'. It appeals\nto people who are keen to improve\nthemselves and claims that members\nwill lose all their mental burdens.\nThe Scientologist's goal is to make\nthe whole planet 'clear, creating a Utopia full of happy, fulfilled people.'\nThey carry out their recruitment in\nTottenham Court Road, inviting\npassers-by to fill in personality\nquestionnaires. These reveal a need\nfor counselling and people are\npersuaded to attend expensive\ncourses. New members are asked to\ninvest in their courses. When they\ncan't pay, they join the staff to work\noff their debt. Some even sign\ncontracts which commit themselves to\nwork for the cult forever. Every\nmember has to recruit a new member\nand detect his personal problems\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198829 "

    "content": "In 1985, in England, Scotland and Wales,\nsomebody killed themselves every two hours. For\npeople under 25 the number of suicides is\nincreasing and is second only to accidents as the\nmost common cause of death.\nYet suicide, one of the most\npersonal of acts, remains one of the\nmost puzzling. The apparently simple\ntask of keeping statistics is\ncomplicated by various factors: many\ndeaths, for example being recorded\nas of undetermined cause, or facts\nbeing concealed among relatives and\nfriends because of the shame\nassociated with a verdict of suicide.\nEven the definition, apparently,\nsimple, causes problems. 'The act for\ninstance of killing oneself\nintentionally', says the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary. But who can be\nsure of the intentions of the victim?\nThe^ case of the 'gesture' going\ntragically wrong is not unknown. And\neven the victims may be unsure of\ntheir motives. Survivors of suicide\nattempts, when questioned, often\nshow confusion about the reasons for\nthe attempt, and indifference to its\nresults.\nThe que sion of motive, among\nother aspects, was studied by the\nFrenchman, Emile Durkheim. In\n1897 he published what is by now one\nof the most important sociological\nstudies of the subject, Le Suicide. The\nmain principle in this was that social\ninstitutions such as the family and\nreligious groups are forces external\nto the individuals and that suicide,\napparently a personal act, was\nexplicable only by the state of the\nsociety to which the individual\nbelonged. On this basis Durkheim\ndivided suicides into three types. In\nthe first, egoistic al suicide, the\nindividual is inadequately concerned\nfor. and involved with, society. This\ngroup includes suicides of the\ndeprived, bereaved and physically\nand mentally ill. The second type, far\nless common is termed altruistic and\noccurs when people are driven to self-destruction by an excessive sense of\nduty. To this category belong the old\nand sick who feel they should\n'relieve' society of themselves, the\nself-sacrifice of martyrs and the\nJapanese ritual hara-kiri pe formed to\nredeem the reputation of the person's family. In a no mic suicide, the third\ncategory, an individual becomes\nparticularly vulnerable to self-destructive impulses because of\nweaknesses of society, for example\nwhen the strength of religious beliefs,\nor professional or marital codes\ndeclines.\nDurkheim's ideas, while they\naccount for some of the incidences of\nsuicide, are of mainly historical\ninterest: suicide as a function of the\nstate of society is now seen as only\npart of the picture.\nAt the other extreme was Freud's theory of a primary 'death instinct'\naccounting not only for suicide but\nalso for acts of aggression against\nothers. But the psychology of the\nindividual differs from that of the\ngroup and only study of both enables\neither to be understood.\nReligion\nAttitudes of society to suicide have\nvaried as much as theories about its\ncauses. Variations between religions\nare striking. Judaism, for example,\nunconditionally disapproves of\nsuicide; in Islam it is regarded as a crime worse than murder and is\nexplicit ely forbidden in the Koran.\nRoman Catholics also regard it as an\nextreme disgrace for the victims of\ntheir families, though suicide is not\nexpressly prohibited in the Christian\nscriptures. The degree of disapproval\nvaries with the particular\ndenomination. Martyrs, however,\nwere admired particularly in Islam\nand early Christianity\u2014the religious\ndefinition of suicide appears\nsomewhat narrower than that used by\nsome psychologists (Durkheim for\nexample).\nBuddhist monk commits suicide\nBy contrast, Hinduism and\nBuddhism tolerate suicide, or even\nencourage it in some cases. Fanatical\nfollowers of these faiths may seek\nsuicide for self-purification, or use it\nin the cause of their religion. For\nexample in South Vietnam in 1963 a number of Buddhist monks set fire to themselves in protest against religious\npersecution.\nSocial Attitudes\nEven within a single culture,\nattitudes to suicide change with time.\nIn European society the reactions used\nto be of abhor en ce and retaliation\u2014\ncomparatively recently (1823) a suicide was buried at a crossroads in\nChelsea with a stake through his\nbody. This custom dated back to pre-Christian times and was probably\nbased in a fear of evil spirits let loose\nby the act of suicide. Nowadays the\nattitude is more one of sympathy, and\nit is realised that those who commit\nor attempt suicide are in acute\ndistress.\nIn Japan the attitude to suicide has\nmoved in other directions: from a society allowing feudal lords to\ndemand compulsory hara-kiri (a practice outlawed in 1868) to one in\nwhich the high number of suicides\namong the young provokes concern.\nThe media display a keen interest\nin the more dramatic suicides, as for\nexample in the wide reporting of the\ndeaths of Dr Gareth Bennet\u2014the man\nwho criticised the Archbishop of\nCanterbury. This plays an obvious\npart in some attempts at suicide:\nprobably the most influential having\nbeen Gandhi's fasting until his\npolitical aim was achieved. Hunger\nstrikes, leading to death in at least one\ncase, were similarly used by\nimprisoned Irish terrorists though\nwith less success.\nThe Law\nThis history of the laws relating to\nsuicide is complex and cannot be\naccounted for solely by religious\ninfluences. In Rome, for example,\npeople accused of capital crimes could \u2022\nsave their estates for their heirs by\ncommitting suicide before the state\ncould confiscate the property. This\nled to the introduction of legislation\nmaking such a suicide equivalent to.\na confession of the crime, carrying\nwith it confiscation of any property.\nRoman law progressed from here to\nmake suicide alone a crime resulting\nin forfeiture of property.\nUnder the law of England, suicide\nmay have been a crime from as early\nas the tenth century. Religious views\nprobably strongly influenced this. But\nthe law has not always reflected the\nattitude of society and has often been\ninconsistently or unfairly applied. The\ncase of the man sentenced in 1955 to\ntwo years imprisonment for\nattempting suicide while in prison is\na particularly clear illustration of the\nresulting hardships. As there was no\nevidence that the threat of prosecution\nacted as a deterrent, pressure mounted\nto get the laws changed. In 1961\nsuicide finally ceased to be a crime,\nand survivors were no longer liable\nto criminal prosecution for the\nmis demean our of attempted suicide.\nUnder the Suicide Act of that year it'\nremained an offence to 'aid, abet,\n32 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

The preparation of meals and\nsnacks always gets a lot of attention.\nA typical meal in many parts of India\nwill include a 'dal', two to three\ndifferent vegetable dishes, a meat dish\n(if the household are non-vegetarians), plain yogurt or 'ra it a', rice (plain boiled rice or an elaborate\npilau), pickles, salad and 'roti'\n(bread). The display of such a spread\nemphasises the daily importance of\nfood to the Indian heart.\nWhilst you may or may not get the\nchance of being dined in our homes\nI hope this article inspires you to\nmake the most of your gastronomic\nenjoyment of a visit to this\nmagnificent subcontinent.\nNew Delhi & Old Delhi\nMany people fly in to Delhi because\nit is a convenient launching pad for\nmandatory visits to Jaipur and Agra.\nThe eating places that I am going\nto recommend span the cost spectrum.\nOpen air eating joint opposite Kantal\ncinema (near the Ring road in the PK\nPuram area of the city)\nI will only recommend this place to\npeople who have acc lim at is ed to\nIndian conditions. This place will give\nyou a damn good flavour of eating out\nin Delhi on the cheap. You will be\nable to choose from 'bot i' kee bab,' seek h' kee bab and some specials of\nthe day. Have 'roma li roti' with\nwhatever you eat. This eat erie is shut\ndown periodically by the city\nauthorities because it is an illegal\nestablishment, but always resurrects\nitself.\nRoshan's of Karolbagh (This is not\na restaurant)\nOnce you are in Karalbagh ask\nanyone to direct you to 'Roshan ki\nkul fi ki d uk an'( Rosan's kul fi store).\nKulfi is Indian icecream. At one time\nRoshan's was a highly regarded place\nto enjoy kul fi, although its name has\nde mini shed recently. You should ask\nthe other patrons eating there what\nthey recommend that should be tried\napart from the kul fi. The famous 'Jalaybees' of Chandni\nChowk\nChandni Chowk is an area in the old\npart of the city. The streets are narrow\nand thronged with merchants, traders\nand full of the huss lebus s le of the\ncity.\nIn the middle of one of the choked\nstreets is a small shop that has made\ncol los al money making j a lay bees, considered a delicacy in many parts\nof India. Ask to be directed to the man\nwho makes the Chowk's famous pure\nghee j a lay bees. Aja lay bee is a hollow coil of batter\nthat is deep fried in 'ghee' (clarified\nbutter) until it is very crisp and light\nbrown. It is then steeped in warm\nsyrup until the passageways in the coil\nbecome filled. .\nThe combination of the buttery taste\nwith the crisp texture of the j a lay bee and the hearty warmth and richness\nof the syrup makes me doubt that\nmanna is the food of the gods.\nKarrim's restaurant in Nizzamudeen\nYou should be able to get the exact\naddress in the phone directory.\nThe chefs in this establishment are\ndirectly descended from the chefs to\nthe Mughal Emperors. One of their\ngastronomic creations must be\namongst the culinary wonders of the\nworld.\nThe house speciality is the\nmarinated leg (ra an) of goat that is\ncooked in a tando or( clay oven). It is\nmade according to their secret\nmethods which most probably\ninvolves the use of green paw-paw to\ntende rise the goat meat. The enzymes\nwithin this fruit give the cooked meat\na melt-in-the-mouth tenderness. The\nchefs take about an hour to get this\nmasterpiece to the table.\nWell you cannot get a culinary\nwonder without a royal price. It will\ncost you about 500Rps, which is\nbetween one to two week's salary of\na starting engineer in India, although\nin sterling it might not look that\noutrageous.\nOne consolation is that there is\nenough meat on the leg to last three\nhungry men without any side dishes.\nThe Deep South\nTamil Nadu will be a haven foi the\nvegetarian traveller. Tdilli* and\n'dos as' feature strongly. Willi is a steamed ground rice cake which is\neaten accompanied by 'sambar'.\n'Sambar' has a distinct spicy taste\nwhich is produced by patiently\ngrinding coconut, chill is and other\ningredients into a paste before it is\nfried together with some vegetables\nand water to produce its earthy south\nIndian taste.\nThe landmarks in the cuisine of the\nSouth are:\n1) Plain dosa (made from rice and\nchickpea flour) eaten with sambar.\n2) Masala dosa. This is akin to a plain dosa, but is rolled and stuffed\nwith spicy potato filling. It is served\nwith sama bar and a coconut chutney,\nbut its taste is best brought out if it\nis enjoyed with the chutney alone.\n3) 'Rava dosa', a lacey plain dosa\nwhich has onions added to it. It can\nbe eaten accompanied with sama bar and some coconut chutney.\n4) Tdilli' or 'rava i dill i', eaten with\nsambar.\n5) 'Uttapam' (made from rice and\nchickpea flour). It is eaten with spiced\nchickpeas.\nNon-vegetarians are recommended to\ntry the chicken dishes, especially the\nchicken kor ma. The Shri Ram Krishna lunch home\n(Subhas Chandra Bhose Road,\nMadras), has been tipped.\nHyderbad (Andhra Pardesh)\nOne cannot visit the bastions of\nMuslim India and not try a goat\nbi ryan i. This city was legendary for\nits excellent bi ryan is and in my books\nit still is.\nA genuine bi ryan i is difficult to\nmake. The rice must be cooked\ntogether with the spiced meat pieces\nlong enough so that each grain oozes\nout the aroma of saffron and the\ncooked meat. The aroma of a first\nclass bi ryan i should be so\noverwhelming that you should be able\nto smell it as soon as it leaves the\nkitchen.\nI suggest that you ask the city locals\nto recommend a place where a good\nbi ryan i could be sampled. I was\nfortunate to be treated to a lunch at\nthe Ritz Hotel in Hyderabad where\nthe chef had mastered this dish.\nGujrat State\nIn many parts of India most food\nestablishments offer a' th ali' which is\na set meal which included portions of\nthe specials of the day served with\nrice, some 'roti' or 'purr es' and\npickles. The th ali is an economical\nway of eating good food in India.\nGujrati food is famous for its\nsnacks. Get someone to recommend\nyou a place where you can enjoy\n'bha jie as'( deep fried vegetables\ncoated in a chickpea flour batter) and\n'dhok ra'( a grainy cake made from\nground chickpeas and rice and\nspices).\nSpecial Points\nNo visit to this subcontinent is\ncomplete without trying a'pa an'.I will recommend that first timers\ntry a' meet a( sweet) paa n'.Apa an is\nmade by coating apa an leaf with lime\nextract and packing it with beetle\nnuts, fennel seeds, peppermint extract\nand other aromatic substances. The\nrolled leaf is meant to be slowly\nchewed and only the aromatic juices\nproduced are swallowed. After a while you might like to spit out any\nfibrous material that is left. Hardened\n'pa an' addicts eat dozens of these\nthings a day.\nNo fruit has inspired the Indian\nmind more than mangoes. Its taste has\nstirred many people to write poetry\nabout it. There are dozens of different\ntypes of mangoes\u2014chos a, langra s, alfonso s. Each type has a different\ncolour, texture, taste and aroma.\nEnjoy the mangoes if you are there\nin the mango season. Get someone to\ntell you about the different types of\nmangoes and try them all.\nBon Voyage & Bon Apetit\nTake it easy on the stomach for the\nfirst five days of arriving in India.\nWash your fruit before eating it and\ngenerally take care otherwise\nMontesuma's revenge will strike you.\nI would like to thank Rashmi,\nRaghunathan and Hitesh for expert\nadvice. It was not possible to mention\neverything I would have like to\ninclude.\nBye, Yishu.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198871 "

Mr\nFilofax was suing her for saying what he'd done with his pl on ker, and Sidney Spanker (ne Whygate) was suing her because he was\napl on ker. 'Why don't you bring back the Duke of Sluicegate, for the last\nissue?', said Cwis Media.\nThere were two problems here. The first one was that Mr E Baron-Writer wasn't writing the Duke anymore. All he wrote now\nwere letters of complaint to Phallix.\nThe second problem was that, in the last episode. The Duke\nhad been killed off.\n'Hmm', said Largeamounts, 'I 'll have to think about this one'.\nThe opening of the door was accompanied by loud singing.\n'Up above the streets and houses. Rainbow flying high.' It was\nPaul Floozie, the Phallix jester. Floozie had become a regular\nfeature in the Office of late, and had been leading Largeamounts\nastray with wild drinking and gambling sessions.\n'How do I resurrect the Duke of Sluicegate, Floozie?', said\nLargeamounts.\n'That's easy, Fatty', said Floozy. 'All you have to do is go back\nin time, to before the last one was written.'\n'Did I hear someone mention time travel?'. It was Willhebe\nGoodforacolumninch, next year's elected Phallix Editor.\nEveryone had started calling him Doctor Who lately. This was\nbecause of the silly hat and scarf he wore during his election\ncampaign.\n'I'M whisk you back in my Tardis', said the Doctor, 'Then you\ncan get the Duke's review of the year before he dies'.\n'Oh dear', said Largeamounts.\n'Blinding idea', said Floozie.\n'Bwilliant', said Cwis Media.\n'Crumbs', said Pippa Trout.\nOctober saw the new leaders of Cheapskate on show to the citizens\nfor the first time. Everyone got on frightfully well for the first day or\ntwo. Largeamounts, the Phallix Editor, was printing nice things about\nthe Citizens' Leader, Ian Whygate. Alan Ego, the Deputy Leader, was\nonly hitting Whygate every other hour, arid Chas Takeiteasy, the\nHonorary Slave, was\ndoing all the duplicating\njobs that people asked\nhim to do. Even John\nSecretary was going\naround shaking hands\nwith everybody....\nLater on in the month,\nthe annual event, Cloth\nWeek, took place. This\nwas the time for all the\ncitizens to do really\nwacky things like\ndrinking gassy liquid,\nthrowing up and being\nrude to everybody. It's a wonder they didn't call it.\nCloth Year, really. There\nwere lots of really good things happening for this year's Cloth Week.\nThere was the Bore Festival, the Beputtosleepanddosillythings Lecture\nand the Burning Concert. Chas Piano-Player spent two days playing\nwith his organ. Everyone paid lots of money to get him to stop.\nThe Cloth Chairman, Nige D Butcher took everyone to Separations\nBar at Zulu for the annual Strip-a pub-bare Night. All the Cheapskate\ncitizens had brought their screwdrivers and crowbars with them. It\nwas great fun, especially as they had caused \u00a31,175 worth of\ndamage.\nThe head citizen of Zulu wasn't too pleased when he saw the\ndamage that had been done. He phoned up Ian Whygate to complain\nabout it. Whygate immediately called Nige D Butcher into his office\nto give him a good ticking off.\n'It wasn't my fault, Ian', crawled Butcher, 'It was all those\nfundamental laws of nature testers and lumps of metal worshippers that\nwere causing the trouble.'\n'Enough of your w hinge ing,' said Whygate. 'If this carries on, you'll\nendanger your chances of getting elected.'\n'You mean, to Head Citizen, Ian?'\n'No, you fool, to join the Bricklayers.'\nAlso during Cloth\nWeek was an exciting\ngame called 'Murder'.\nThis involves citizens\nsquirting each other with\nwater, laughing, and\nrunning away. Dave\nBraincell hadn't wanted\nto play this game. He was\nwet enough already.\nIn December, Whygate\nwas taken prisoner by the\ncitizens of Sorryland.\nTheir head citizen had\ndemanded one hundred\npounds from Cheapskate\nor else Whygate would\nbe kept. Alan Ego and\nChas Takeiteasy were in\na dod gy position here.\nThey didn't want\nWhygate back, so they went round persuading everyone not to part\nwith their cash. Back in the Citizens Office, Mrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks\nwasn't impressed with this, so she devised a cunning plan to get her\nHead Citizen back.\nLocked tightly away in the Cheapskate safe, was a large brown\nenvelope. It contained lots of money and had the following notice\nwritten on the front:\nAuntie Jolly's Naughty Brown Envelope\n(only to be opened in emergencies)\n1. To buy sherry and quiche.\n2. To buy more sherry and quiche.\n3. To bail Whygate out, where necessary.\n'Ah, this'll do the trick,' said Jolly Hockey-Sticks, as she pulled out\nfive crisp \u00a320 notes. 'I 'll send the money off straight away. Now,\nwhere did I put that glass?'\nJanuary was largely uneventful. Takeiteasy was complaining about\nholidays everyone had been taking. Largeamounts had spent the new\nyear on the p iste in France, Whygate had been living it up courtesy\nof his captors in Sorryland and Ego had headed for Malta. Takeiteasy\nsoon stopped complaining when it was pointed out that he'd been\non holiday for five months already.\n24 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Maybe Baby (Cert 15)\nTwo high school kids are in love.\nSoon, after a few years apart, one at\nCalTech, the other at the University\nof Wisconsin, they plan to get married\nand live happily ever after with none\nof the pitfalls which life scatters\nbefore lesser couples. 'Perhaps it\nwon't work out' says she. 'No, we're\ndifferent' says he. Of course, that's rubbish. Nobody is different.\nThe girl is Darcy Eilliot, played\nwell and with conviction by Molly\nRingwald (The Breakfast Club, Pretty\nin Pink). Her boyfriend is Stan\nBobrucz, newcomer Randall\nBatinkoff. Together they look good.\nMr and Mrs Happy Couple.\nIt takes just six attempts, despite the\npill's statistics, for Darcy to become\npregnant. Not the most ideal state of\naffairs for a student to be in. What can\nthey do? Darcy's mother calls for\nabortion, but she's a divorcee and\nhates to see her daughter follow the\npath of wedded bliss. Stan's father\nshouts adoption, clouded judgement\nthis time comes from his wish to push\nhis son through CalTech. Darcy and\nStan want to keep the child though.\nWith just over nine hundred dollars\nthey elope and begin their\nindependence and expected joy of\neach other. Everything is against\nthem, parents, finances and quite\nsimply the odds, but Darcy and Stan\nhave something special\u2014the kind of\ntrue love most people can't even\nimagine. All the same, they don't have a hope.\nAs soon as the baby arrives the\ntables are turned. Parents, now\ngrandparents, love it, but the happy\ncouple can't cope with the stresses\nand strains of adulthood proper.\nEverything collapses and they\nseparate, with a little help from\nDarcy's bitchy rival.\nDirector John Avildsen employs his\npersonal tactic of character\nsym pathis ation perfectly. Identifying\nwith an adolescent is a simple task for\nanyone, so he needed to m;::.. little\neffort. The film could have been\nbased on a true story. Twenty\nthousand teenage girls become\npregnant in America every week, we\nare told. Most of them probably tackle\nthe problems of maturing quickly at\nleast as poorly as Darcy and Stan.\nWhether true love can conquer all is\nthe real uncertainty.\nMaybe Baby is a strange film in that\nit spends an hour or so showing the\n(potentially adolescent) audience how\ndifficult successful parenthood can be\nwithout suggesting it is unattainable.\nSuddenly there is a change of tack and\nwith a quick slap across the face the\ndirector, writer, producer, etc point\nout the problem with teenagers.\nAdolescents are adolescent. 'You're\nstill a kid, you just forgot for a while.'\nIn making this statement the\napproach of the film becomes an\ninsult. I could almost imagine the\ndirector sniggering at his audience\nfrom behind the camera, saying 'Ha!\nYou thought I was treating you all as\nadults, didn't you?'. Insults hurt most\nwhen they contain an element of truth\nand that perhaps is the real point of\nthe film.\nMaybe Baby is not the most\nentertaining film around, but given\nthe reasoning behind the movie it's one of the most artistically successful.\nMolly Ringwald is particularly good\nand holds the whole story together.\nIf you're fond of tear jerk ers then\nyou'll love it, but otherwise give it a miss. It opened last Friday at Canons\nHaymarket, Oxford Street and\nChelsea.\nAndrew Clarke.\nInnerspace\nAnother of Spielberg's amazingly\nsuccessful and phenomenally\nentertaining movies hits the small\nscreen. Innerspace is a tongue in\ncheek remake of Fantastic Voyage,\nwith more than just an excuse for\nshrinking people.\nDennis Quaid is brilliant as the\nhapless pilot, struggling to survive\ninside Martin Short's body. He\ndoesn't just have to contend with\ndefence systems and bodily fluids\neither. There is another battle in the\noutside world between Quaid's team\nand a rival collection of nas ties, which\nwould ultimately determine his fate.\nThe final race against time is both\nexciting and h ilia riou s, and makes this\nmovie one of the best releases of the\nyear.\nAndrew Clarke.\nWoody Allen has a talent for moving\npeople at the most basic level with the\nsimplest of storylines. In Radio Days\nhe does it again with an unashamedly\nnostalgic trip down memory lane. He\nchronicles the lives of a Jewish family\nin Brooklyn at the start of the war and\nshows how their lives were influenced\nand shaped by the radio stars and\nshows of the day.\nThe joy of the film is in the\nhumour, derived from affection rather\nthan ridicule of such fictional classics\nas Breakfast with Irene and George\nand The Masked Avenger. A host of\nAllen regulars all seem perfectly at\nease with the period and style while\nAllen links the various sketches\neffortlessly into a coherent whole. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.\nSteve Roberts.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198873 "

    "content": "Features Since the racing\ncolumn and its\naccompanying\nselections for the\nweekend's racing\nstarted appearing in\nFELIX, loads of\nrequests have\narrived at the office\nasking us how to\nbet, what different\nbets are available\nand how to read\nracing form. This\nfeature attempts to\nexplain these points\nalong with a brief\nbackground to\nracing.\nBets Available\nWin:\nThis is by far the most common bet.\nThe punter is wagering that his\nselection will win the race outright.\nThe return is the starting price for\nevery pound staked ie \u00a3 2 win at 6-1\ngives a return of:\n\u00a32 x(61)+ stake\n= \u00a3 1 2 + \u00a3 2 = \u00a3 1 4\nEach'Way (E/W): Another very popular bet. This is two\nbets rolled into one\u2014a win bet and a place bet. The win part is as above.\nThe place part is a bet that the\nselection will finish in the first three\npast the post.\nThe return on the bet is usually\ncalculated at Vt the odds ie for \u00a3 5\nE/W at 8-1, the total staked is \u00a3 1 0 .\n\u2022 If the selection finishes 2nd or 3rd, then the return is:\n(W) x(81)x( \u00a35) + stake\n= \u00a3 1 0 + \u00a3 5 = \u00a315.\n\u2022 If the selection wins, then the return\nis:\n(win return) + (place return)\n= \u00a3 4 5 + \u00a3 2 5 = \u00a3 6 0 .\nDouble:\nA double is a bet on two separate\nraces. In order for the bet to win, both\nselections must win. The return is\ncalculated as if the winnings from the\nfirst race are all placed on the second\nie:\n\u00a35 double at 3-1 and 5-1.\nReturn from first race =\n\u00a35 @ 3-1 + stake = \u00a3 2 0 .\nReturn from second race =\n\u00a3 2 0 @ 5-1 + stake = \u00a3 1 2 0 .\nThe net return is therefore \u00a3120.\nTrebles and Above:\nHigher combinations of races are\npermitted and are called\naccumulators. They are calculated in\nmuch the same way as doubles.\nPermutation Bets:\nSeveral bets are permitted which mix\nsingles, doubles and high\naccumulators.\n* Patent\u2014This is a permutation\ncovering three races. It consists of\nfour bets\u2014one treble and three\ndoubles.\n\u2022 Trixie\u2014Similar to a patent but also\ncovering three singles\u2014a total of\nseven bets\nYankee\u2014A total of 11 bets,\ncovering one four-horse\naccumulators, four trebles and six\ndoubles.\n\u2022 Canadian\u201426 bets: One five-fold,\nfive four-folds, 10 trebles and 10\ndoubles.\n\u2022 Heinz\u201457 bets: one six fold, six\nfive-folds, 15 four-folds, 20 trebles\nand 15 doubles.\n(M cot tes villes\"1,672.60,, hard,\n' Scudalyed on\ni4tch d1110)32 V4I, chase,\n11-0), 2\n, lad to\nit fed and\n9 to 1) 3\n151,2J a, \u2022o) nov\nI(710 Charter\n\" (7-10-, head-)10to0 s( a \u00a31,772.10: 1 El Cito (11-10-0). 2 Sea\n.flower (NZ) (6-11-1), 3 Grecian Bust (5-9-'7,7'). 6 PYLEIGH COURT (6-11-1, C Llewellyn), ao headway from three out.

I'm sure that as a good\nBaptist Minister, Andrew's father didn't bring him up to\ntell fibs, and so saying that Neil stood up in an English\nclass and shaved off all his pubic hair is obviously just\na slip of Andrew's memory. Neil, in fact, never did\nanything so exciting in the second year,first year, or even\nat primary school\u2014and I was in the same class to him\nbetween the ages of eight and twelve, so I can purport\nto be a reasonably good authority on the subject.\nKirstie Hollidav.\nEd's note: I think that it's come to the time when I must\nformally apologise on behalf of Delator for the things\nwritten about Neil Motteram in the Blackmail column\nthis year. Mr Thompson tells me that the story we ran\nwas 'based on truth'. However, Mr Motteram has\nrevealed that he removed his underpants in a lesson\nat school using Mr Thompson's scissors because they\nwere 'painful'.

But to donate any other part of the proceeds,\nhowever small, is ludicrous. Especially as, with the help\nof last year's fair, the Nursery purchased an industrial\nwashing machine costing approximately \u00a31,200. This was\nan unnecessary exorbitant expense.

    "content": "mentioned, can be a great advantage.\nBetter contacts with the media in the\noutside world will be a good\nadvantage to us, both for the students\ninvolved in those publications and for\nthe publications themselves, and I think building and establishing those\nlinks could be very good.\nWhat's the worst aspect of being\nPresident?\nSeeing all the work pile up on your\ndesk and having to spend your\nevenings and weekends clearing it at\nthe end of the week.\nThis year has been characterised by\na great many problems within the\nUnion: the loss of \u00a335,000 from the\nsnack bar, the departure of the\nDeputy President, and a good deal\nof personal bickering. In retrospect,\ndo you think that these problems\ncould have been avoided?\nI think one good thing has come out\nof those problems, and that is that\nwe've cleared the ship. When I started, I said I'd give the students a new Union, and that's what they've\ngot next year, a new Union. I do\nbelieve that we could have avoided\nsome of the petty bickering, and\nthere's no doubt: Chris Martin put a very good article in FELIX just\nrecently, saying how you can come\nto compromise. What Chris failed to\ngather was the fact that I have one\nyear in which to achieve something,\nand in that year I can only do so\nmuch. I can sit there and report on\neverything I do, try to spend twice as\nlong getting a concensus on\nsomething that would reach a concensus in the direction it was\ngoing anyhow. Or I can create some\nbad feeling but get done twice or three\ntimes as much. Every letter I write to\nFELIX, in response to something\npetty or pathetic written about me, is\none letter I can't write to something\nimportant, somebody who may need\ntheir financial situation sorting out\nwith College because they have a problem, it's one College committee\nthat I can't reorganise so that the\nstudents get better representation.\nThe Alternative Prospectus\nSupplement this year has been\ncriticised for not researching its\nmaterial properly and for saying\none or two controversial things\nabout the various departments.\nWhat was your reaction to the\nsupplement?\nThe factual information is not very\nfactual and infact it is all totally being\nre-written by myself and next year's Deputy President, Chas Brereton.\nThe departments have expressed\nthanks that we are doing so. As far\nas the editorial was concerned it has\nasked whether the author was\nqualified to make the suggestions he\ndid, on the basis that he was not\nacademically orientated and his\nknowledge of College academia was\ntherefore limited. I feel that his\nopinions are valid and should stand-after all he was elected editor of the\nsupplement. If this College is\napathetic enough that someone gets\ninto the position of editing the AP and\nthat person is a disheartened\nindividual then it is this College's responsibility to make sure that does\nnot happen by improving the welfare\nfacilities and the academic life at this\ncollege. Far too much impression is\nput on the academic side and not\nenough on to how a student ought to\nbe developing in other ways. To say\nthat we in the Student's Union are\nwrong to let a student produce a publication which comes out in this\nform is hypocritical in the extreme.\nIf you had the chance to be\npresident over again would you?\nOver again, yes. If I was a year back\nand I was asked if I wanted to do this\njob, yes I would do it again. Would\nI, as many people have suggested\nstand for presidency again?\nAbsolutely no way! I 've got a lot I want to do in the rest of my life. There\nare some good people already lining\nup for posts in the Students Union.\nIt's something I am pleased about\nbecause I 've not seen it happen\nbefore. And as a result I see\nabsolutely no reason why I should put\nanother year of my life into Imperial\nCollege Union.\nIs there anything else that you\nwould liked to have achieved given\nthe time or the opportunity?\nIf I could have put in more hours\nwork then I would have definitely\nliked to do a lot more on the welfare\nside of things. But I 've really had a great problem in finding time to do\nvery much in those areas. As far as\nlong term planning and achievements\nare concerned, I think I 've achieved\nas much as I could possibly have\ndone, especially considering the\nuproar in the snack bar over the last\nterm. I do still hope to be involved\nin the Union next year. If there is\nanything I would liked to have done\ndifferently, I would have liked to have\nsaid that I had got along with a lot\nmore students. I do not know how I could have achieved it. I went in to\nclear up what I saw was a mess. I did\nnot expect to be popular at the end.\nI am not particularly popular now, but\nI'm glad that I have done it.\nDo you think that you will find it\ndifficult to re-adjust yourself to\nacademic work?\nQuite possibly yes. I can see that I will\nhave a problem adapting\npsychologically to college work\nagain. There is more of a drudgery\nto it, although there is a lot in the\nUnion that is tedious. But I do feel\nthat this year has benefitted me greatly\nin an organisational way. I now know\nhow to use my time fully and I have\nfound that I can use a lot more of my\ntime for work and enjoy it a lot more.\nWhat are your plans for when you\nleave College ?\n\\ s far as my plans when I leave\n;ol leg e are concerned, I 've got a lumber for next year including a very\narge fund raising project to raise\nnone y for lots of charities. I don't quite know where that will leave me\nin the future. My overall objectives\nire to make a million pounds before\n1 am thirty and then give it all away\nand then do it again. Outside of that\nI want to be be working on the\naccommodation problem in London.\nI don't quite know where I'm going\nto find the financial backing yet but\n1 do know I'm going to find it\nsomewhere.\nWhat aspects of the Union are you\ngoing to be involved in next year?\nSpecifically Rag. Because I went and\norganised this major fund raising\nthing and I 've got a lot of satisfaction\nout of doing that this year. Such\nthings as changing my name-something that I am going to stick\nby\u2014running the Bar Birthday Ball,\nbeing kidnapped. But, yeah, I want\nto work in Rag and help to advise in\nareas such as Academic Affairs. It\nwill probably be within the\ndepartment filtering through the\nsystem, but I will hope that some of\nthis year's officers who are coming\nin will ask me if they have any queries\nor my opinion because the amount of\nknowledge you pick up of the system\nover a year of intensive work is\nhumu ngu s. Do you think that being President\nhas increased your popularity with\nmembers of the opposite sex?\nI 've got to say that this year I have\nspent less time in the presence on a personal level of members of the\nopposite sex than I have ever done in\nthe whole of life. I haven't really had\na personal life. This myth that by\nbeing President you find that people\nof the opposite sex flock around you\nmight be true but I just haven't had\nthe time to see it happening.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198813 "

    "content": "FELIX\nIC RADIO NEXT YEAR\nListening to you...\nImperial College Radio next year\nFor almost ten years. Imperial\nCollege Radio has been broadcasting\nto the Southside and Linstead Halls\non 999kHz medium wave. The\nprogrammes that we provide at the\nmoment are mostly music, and can be\nheard in the mornings and evenings.\nAs well as our medium wave service,\nwe can be heard in the JCR at\nlunchtimes as well as in Evelyn\nGardens.\nWell, that's the 'Story so far', but\nwhat's going to happen next year? As\nwe move in to our second decade,\nwe're going to try and tailor our\nservice more closely to what we think\npeople want to listen to. I'm sure that\nthis has been said before, and you\nmay not believe it. If you don't, the\nbest thing to do is to come and join\nus. The membership fee this year was\nfour pounds, which put a lot of people\noff. Next year you can get involved\nfor only one pound, and you'll be\nallowed to do just about what you\nwant to. We're always very keen to\nlet people do specialist music shows,\nalthough there have to be some\nrestrictions on when you can do\nthem\u2014heavy metal clog dancing\ndoesn't go down too well at breakfast\ntime!\nAside from the specialist music\nshows, we're going to try and give\nthe station a much more definite style\nnext year. This doesn't mean that\npeople won't be allowed to choose\nwhat they play, but it does mean that\nthey will be encouraged to play\ncertain sorts of records. Exactly what\nsort is actually going to depend on\nyou, the listeners.\nOne of the little known facts about\nIC Radio is that we have a written\nrecord of almost everything that has\nbeen played on air, and whether or\nnot it was a request. Over the\nsummer, we'll be going through some\nof these lists and seeing what are the\nmost popular records, then basing our\noutput on those. Hopefully this will\nmean that we will be playing much\nmore of the sort of music that you\nlike, and we'll be reviewing the list\nregularly so that it doesn't become\npredictable.\nNo matter how good we sound as\na result of our new music policy, it\nwon't be much use if people can't hear us. Over the summer we'll be\ndoing quite a lot of work, so that in\nOctober our signal will be clearer than\never before. Another of our long term\nprojects is a move to FM in Southside\nand Linstead (we can't reach all hall\nresidents until the law is changed),\nand we'll be doing some test\ntransmissions during the summer. If\nthese go well, you may be able to hear\nsome of our programmes in stereo\nnext year!\nOf course, IC Radio isn't just\nmusic; there's also news about what's happening in College and around\nLondon. This year, we've made a start with two programmes,\n'Streetlife' and 'Viewpoint', and next\nyear we hope to have much more\ninformation for you, including a broadcast at around one o 'clock to the\nJCR to tell you about what's happening that day.\nIf none of what I 've talked about\nso far appeals to you, how about\ngetting involved in the technical side\nof the station? There will be some\ninteresting challenges for the technical\nteam over the next year, with the\npossibility of running a line to St\nMary's, transmitting on FM in stereo\nand trying to get our signal to as many\nplaces as possible.\nIf y t>u want to get involved, then\ncome down to the station some time\nand find out a bit more about us.\nWe're next to the Southside Shop, and\nwe don't bite! Alternatively, drop a note in the internal mail, or call us on\nextension 3440, Garden Hall 555 or\nSouthside 89.\nAll in all then, next year is going\nto see quite a few changes in Imperial\nCollege Radio. To mark all these\nchanges, and the start of our second\ndecade on the air, we'll be trying to\norganise more events than ever\nbefore, and designing a new logo to\ngo with our new style. Over the next\nfew months, we will be working hard\nbehind the scenes so that everything\nwill be ready for the start of next year.\nI'm afraid you won't be able to notice\nmuch change in the station until then,\nbut give us a listen anyway\u2014you may\nbe pleasantly surprised, and if you\nhave any criticism, then please let us\nknow. Next year, we're going to\nlisten to the people listening to us.\nTune in next October, and hear the\ndifference.\nNigel Whitfield,\nStation Manager 1988-89.\nA FELIX Summer T Shirt to everybody who manages to\ncomplete this crossword correctly.\nAcross\nI.

One proposed\nsolution is to build a room underneath\nthe old Holland Club...\nGuilds' year started off well, with\nthe rebuilding of Bo and the election\nof first year Chem Eng student Tanya\nMaule as Vice President, after her\npredecessor failed his exams.\nHowever, they were led by their\nPresident to steal FELIX, a ladder and\nto attempt to steal the RCS mascot,\nTheta. While the last of these may\nhave been a jolly decent effort in the\nname of mascot ry, the others most\ncertainly were not, nor was the\n'Second Lieutenant's' threat to\ndamage STOIC equipment if they\nbroadcast during Guilds Carnival.\nSteve Pierson and Vince Roper\nwere severely embarrassed at the end\nof October. Their 'crime' was to\nrescue a woman from drowning in the\nThames. The two were practising in\na cox less fours boat with two fellow\nmembers of the ICU Boat Club and\nwere subsequently branded 'heroes'\nby Club Captain Rob Gee, who was\nalso present.\nOther Athletics Clubs were seen in\na less favourable light after visiting\nSurrey University in November.\nTheir behaviour incited the Surrey\nPresident to call for Imperial students\nto be 'banned from every college in\nthe country'. His Deputy was less\nvitriolic, and in fact the extent of the\ntrouble Imperial students caused is not\nclear.\nIn a peace-making move, Imperial's President Ian Howgate allowed\nhimself to be kidnapped. His captors\nshaved off half of his famous\nmoustache and gave him a severe hair\ncut. The rest of his hair was\nransomed\u2014the more money IC\ncollected for Surrey Rag, the more of\nhis body would be shaved. Mr\nHowgate was returned looking\nsomewhat streamlined.\nAnother IC student experiencing a 'close shave' was Hang Glider Club\nChair Andrew Hill, who had a near\nmiss with another glider over the\nSouth Downs. The other pilot\nadmitted responsibility and agreed to\npay the repair costs of about \u00a3200.\nAnother display of anti-social\nbehaviour, this time at UL U, caused\ntrouble for IC Union in Rag Week.\nAlthough drinking the UL U bar dry\nensured any profits went back to\nstudents, the stealing of signs worth\nabout \u00a31000 and generally disruptive\nbehaviour did nothing to enhance the\nCollege's reputation. Most of the\nsigns were returned but the Rag\nCommittee later decided that drink-a pub-dry should not be part of Rag\nWeek any longer.\nAlthough not of direct concern to\nmost students, the closure of Central\nStores will result in substantially\nincreased costs for supplies to the\nUnion and other parts of the College,\naccording to the staff unions. Mr\nTerry Neville and College Secretary\nJohn Smith have stated that the\nsavings would be of the order of\n\u00a3 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 by splitting up ordering\nbetween departments, but this figure\nis disputed by the unions who claim\n\u00a3 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year can be saved by the\ncentralisation of purchasing.\nMajor changes to ICU were agreed\nin the Spring Term. Although it is\nunlikely to trouble any world leaders,\ngenerations of Imperial students will\nfeel the effects of the Union\nreorganisation. The full details can be\nobtained from the Union Office, but\nroughly speaking the Union has lost\nan Hon Sec (dogs body) and gained an\nHon Sec (Events). The President and\nDP will in future be expected to\nrepresent students (so what were they\nsupposed to do in the past?) and the\nUnion has gained a Finance Officer\nand Union Manager. The changes\nwere not universally popular, and\nmany people criticised the way they\nwere brought in.\nThe other two changes were the\nmoving of the sabbatical year a month\nback, so that it now runs from the\nbeginning of August each year.\nHowever, more shocking than this,\nwas the announcement that Ian\nHowgate would not be Union\nPresident any more. IC students\nreading The Sun (page 3) were treated\nto an article about 'Wacky Ian', 24,\nwho agreed to change his name if\nsufficient money was raised for\ncharity. More than \u00a3800 was actually\nraised; a Harbour-Bridge was born.\nULU, only just recovering from the\nIC students' rampage, was shaken in\nFebruary by the resignation of its\nRag Chairman and President-elect\nNigel Baker taking time off in\nbetween injunctions.\nVice President (Services), Lachie\nStuart. The unfortunate Mr Stuart was\nforced to resign after a motion of no\nconfidence against him was passed at\nthe union's governing body, General\nUnion Council.\nULU hacks may also have been\nrather shocked when an ICUGM\npassed a motion supporting LSE\nUnion's campaign to force the School\nto d is invest in South Africa. The\nmotion was the first time ICU has had\npolicy on South Africa.\nAnother astounding display of\nstudents 'getting involved' occurred\nat the beginning of March. The\nlecturers' union AUT organised a lobby of Parliament against the Great\nEducation Reform Bill, and a strike\norganised by Sydney Harbour-Bridge\n(name changed in aid of Comic\nRelief) was very well supported. The\nstrike was sympathetic action, which\nalso gave the lecturers time to go to\nthe House of Commons.\nLess-than-charitable goings on\nwere worrying Rag Chair Nigel Baker\nat the time. Having discovered a group called London Rag 88 selling\nits glossy mags, he made enquiries\ninto the organisation and found their\nnamed charity knew very little about\nthem. Mr Baker also rang some of the\nadvertisers in the London Rag Mag\nto point out that it has no connection\nwith IC Rag. The London Rag\norganisers responded to this by\nthreatening to issue an injunction if\nhe did not stop telephoning the\nadvertisers. They claimed that \u00a34,000\nworth of advertising had been lost\nalready. However, no further action\nREVIEW FELIX Wednesday June 22nd198821 "

He is helped out here by Billy Crystal\n(Running Scared)\n(24th June)\nThe setting is the Saigon of 1968. You\nmay think this is another Vietnam\nfilm, but war-torn Vietnam is just\nused as an intriguing backdrop for an\nexciting detective thriller made in the\ngreat tradition of Bullitt and The\nFrench Connection. Daniel Dafoe\n(Platoon) and Gregory Hines\n(Running Scared) star as two\nAmerican military cops investigating\na series of murders involving young\nVietnamese prostitutes.\nThe action comes thick and fast,\nand it all makes for a great thriller.\n(8th July)\nSeptember\nSeptember is the sixteenth film written\nand directed by Woody Allen and\nshows a marked change in style. It is\na deep, dark and quite often\ndepressing study of the relationship\nbetween a mother (Elaine Stritch) and\nher daughter (Mia Farrow). An\nimpressive cast, including Denhoim\nElliott and Sam Waterston, turn in\ngood performances, but one thing is\nmissing from this film and that is\nhumour, and a Woody Allen film\nwithout humour is just vacuous.\n(1st July)\nSign '0' the Times\nThe spectacular Prince concert comes\nto the screen.

    "content": "Feat u The past academic\nyear has seen a stream of dramatic\nevents throughout\nthe Union and\nCollege. Finance\n'blunders' have hit\nSherfield many\ntimes, causing\nunending trouble\nand potentially\ncosting departments\nand students\nthousands of\npounds. Meanwhile\nstudents were faced\nwith soaring rents,\nsubstandard or\novercrowded\naccommodation and\nthe loss of several\nCollege-run\nproperties.\nThe Union also\nwent through its\nups and downs,\nfrom the Harlington\nGravel victory to\nthe loss of a music\nroom, enduring\nnumerous\npersonality clashes\nand even the kidnap\nof its President.\nNEWS R1EV1 EW\nby Pippa Salmon\n'The money's too\ntight to mention'\nThe year started as it was to go on,\nwith an Inland Revenue investigation\nrevealing that College Refectories\nhave not paid tax on the wages of their\ncasual workers. This was to*cost up\nto \u00a3 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 and resulted in the\nworkers hourly wages being raised\nthirty pence to \u00a3 2 . 3 0 , so that the 30p could be paid as tax.\nMeanwhile, the Union made a minor coup by gaining control of the\nCollege's beer supplies. Since\nImperial is not a member of the NUS\nit is unable to benefit from the\nNational Student Services\nOrganisation Scheme, so it was\nthought that the new central ordering\nsystem would result in 'substantial\nsavings'.\nBy the end of the summer, it had\nbeen revealed that the money from\nsales of Harlington Gravel in fact\nshould be used for the 'improvement\nof student facilities in South\nKensington', according to longstanding agreements. The profits from\ngravel extraction could well be as\nmuch as \u00a33 million in total, or about\n\u00a3 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. As the extraction is\ndamaging the sports pitches at\nHarlington and the money is now\ncontrolled by the College Athletics\nCommittee, the proceeds will be used\nto start a trust fund which will pay for\na new sports centre in South\nKensington.\nEnts got off to a similarly good\nstart, taking around \u00a3 1 0 , 0 0 0 in\nentrance fees at their Freshers' Week\nevents. The profits were to be used\nto sub sid is e other Ents events.\nUnfortunately, over \u00a3 1 0 0 in cash,\nseveral jackets, credit cards and a passport were stolen at the Friday Ball\nthat week, which presumably reduced\nthe good time had by all.\nAutumn was also a happy time for\nRag, which raised in a term almost\nas much as was raised during the\nwhole of the previous year. A new,\nrecord Rag Week total of \u00a3 1 0 , 8 4 0\nwas achieved.\nA con man hit Imperial at the end\nof the first term, tricking a student\ninto giving him \u00a31,000. This was not\nthe first time he was seen at the\nCollege but. as far as is known, it was\nthe last time he was successful.\nAt the same time, a new permanent\nmember of staff was appointed in the\nUnion Office. Reggie Blennerhasset\nwas engaged as Finance Officer and\nstarted work after Christmas and\narrived just in time for the discovery\nof the amazing RCSU debt. The new\nRCSU Senior Treasurer, Dr Ken\nBignal found over \u00a3 5 , 0 0 0 of\naccumulated College bills outstanding\nand another \u00a3 5 0 0 lost on Freshers'\nDinners. Dave Williams, the Junior\nTreasurer, attributed the debts to a bad attitude in the Union over\nspending. He added that Union\nactivities would have to stop when the\nyear's allocations run out.\nReturning to College after the\nChristmas holiday, students were\ninformed they could expect a4% increase in grants next year. Parental\ncontributions will rise but the\nthreshold for parental incomes, as\nwell as the points on the'cc n tri but ion scale, will rise an average of 6.5%.\nIt was a pleasant surprise to many that\nthe increase is comparable to the\ninflation rate, but unfortunately the\nrise in house prices (and,\ncorrespondingly in rents) in the South\nEast has been about 20% this year.\nPresident Ian Howgate expressed his\ndissatisfaction with the increase, in\nview of the cuts in Housing Benefit,\nand that the Government is\n'instigating the student loan system\nalready'.\nMore trouble in the College\nFinance Section was revealed at the\nbeginning of January. A series of\ncatastrophic failures of the disc subsystem in the new year made it\nimpossible to process staff expenses\nor to pay suppliers who were starting\nto refuse to deliver until their bills\nwere settled. The Union was also\nbeginning to complain that the\nCollege had not finished the 1986/87\nUnion audit. Although this should\nhave been over by November many\nsections had not been examined.\nIn February, the Education\nSecretary Kenneth Baker denied that\nthe Government would interfere in the\nallocation of funds by the new\nUniversity Funding Council. He\nadded that there would be\namendments to the Great Education\nReform Bill ensuring the Secretary of\nState had no power to specify how\nmoney would be distributed.\nIt was announced that the Union\nwould gain yet another permanent\nmember of staff, bringing the total in\nthe Union Office to one part-time and\nfour full-time employees. The latest\naddition was to be a Union Manager,\nresponsible for the Snack Bar, Bar,\ntransport and possibly the Southside\nShop if it were taken over in the\nfuture. The Manager, Dave Peacock,\nstarted work after Easter after\nworking in UL U looking after its\nshop.\nJust before the Easter holiday, the\nChancellor of the Exchequer\nannounced in his Budget that\ncovenants will be abolished for\nstudents. In compensation, parents of\nstudents entering higher education for\nthe first time next autumn will be\nexpected to pay up to 25% less\ntowards their maintenance. This\nreduction was much higher than had\nbeen expected and the bill will be\npicked up by the student's LEA rather\nthan causing a drop in grants.\nHowever, students already in higher\neducation will not receive any extra\nmoney, even if they do not have a current covenant it was decided.\nBy the time undergraduates\nreturned for the Summer term, the\n18 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

No need to tell you i ust how antisocial too much fibre can\nmake you!\nAdditives Food additives are natural or\nartificially produced substances which\nmay be added to food in small\namounts to perform specific\nfunctions. There are four basic\ncategories of additives.\n\u2022 to maintain freshness and give a longer shelf life.\n\u2022to enhance flavour or appearance of\nprocessed food.\n\u2022 to assist in the processing or\npreparation of food.\n\u2022to improve nutritional value.\nSupermarkets and most consumers\nare keen to keep the additives in our\nfood because there is less spoilage and\nmore profit if food keeps longer and\nlooks better. We couldn't keep our\nfood for as long as we do now if all\nadditives were removed and more\nfood would have to be thrown away.\nIt is also certain that there would be\nmore cases of food poisoning because\na few types of food can become a health risk before they either look or\ntaste off. Ultimately we'd all be\nforced to spend a great deal more on\nfood and be a lot sicker for it. But this\nhasn't stopped scientists trying to find\nalternative additives to those which\nhave been shown to be irritants or\ncar ce no geni c. Some additives are essential for the\ncreation of products in the form in\nwhich they are known and enjoyed.\nIt is additives which enhance the\ncolour^or flavour of food which are\nthe ones that seem to cause the most\nconcern. They do, howeVer, make the\nfood we eat more acceptable to us.\nTrials have shown that the majority\nof the public will not eat brown tinned\nstrawberries or khaki-coloured tinned\npeas.\nNaturally occur ing colours or\npigments are very sensitive to light\nand heat, particularly in acid foods.\nWhen a manufactured produce is\nrequired to go through a heating\nprocess, the processors will add a more resistant synthetic dye to keep\nthe colour.\nSometimes nutrients are added to\nsupplement your daily requirements\nof vitamins and minerals from the\nconsumption of processed food.\nIt is a fallacy that additives are all\nchemical, artificial, unnecessary and\nwhere possible, to be avoided. There\nis, however, an increasing demand for\nfoods without additives, especially\nthose believed to cause allergic,\nintolerant or hyperactive reactions.\nFunctions that the additives\nperform\nFood additives which prevent\nspoilage and maintain freshness:\nANTIOXIDANTS\nAntioxidants prevent or delay the\nrancidity of fats by retarding the\nprocess of oxidation due to oxygen in\nthe air. Many crude fats and oils\ncontain antioxidants naturally.\nHowever, these are removed during\nthe refining process and technologists\nneed to add natural or artificial\nreplacements. Antioxidants also\nprevent enz y mic browning which\ncauses the discoloration of fruit,\nvegetables and fruit juices.\nPRESERVATIVES\nPreservatives kill micro-organisms\n(bacteria, fungi, mould and yeast)\nwhich would otherwise cause food\ndecay and possibly create health\nhazards. They extend the shelf life of\nproud ct s and some preservatives\nprotect the natural colour or flavour\nof certain foods. In the past, sugar and\nsalt were used as preservatives, but\nfor health reasons it is recommended\nthat sugar and salt in our diet should\nbe reduced. High sugar and salt foods\nmust, therefore, be preserved in other\nways.\nAdditives which assist the\nprocessing or preparation\nACIDS\nAcids impart a tart flavour desirable\nin some foods. They also assist in the\nrelease of carbon dioxide when\npresent in raising agents. They have\na preservative effect.\nACID REGULATORS/BUFFERS\nAcid regulators/buffers change or\nmain tian the acidity of alkalinity\nlevels for desired effect. These\ninclude preservation, added or altered\nflavour or tartness, texture\ndevelopment, colour retention and\nassistance in the action of raising\nagents.\nANTI-CAKING AGENTS\nAnti-caking agents pr vent the 'caking'\nor lumping of finely powdered or\ncrystalline substances such as salt,\ndried milk and sugar.\nBLEACHING AGENTS\nBleacing agents bleach or whiten \"tour\nand bread.\nBULKING AGENTS\nBulking agents add bulk to food\nwithout providing energy (ie\nkilocalories) and hence are intended\nprimarily for 'slimming' foods. They\nare not usually digested and,\ntherefore, act as a course of dietary\nfibre, previously termed 'roughage'.\nDILUENTS\nDiluents dilute of dissolve other\nadditives, often colours.\nEMULSIFIERS\nEmulsifiers aid the formation of an\nemulsion between two substances\nwhich would not normally mix, such\nas oil and water. The emulsifier helps\nto disperse tiny droplets of one\nsubstance in a suspension of the other.\nFor example, milk, mayonnaise and\nsalad dressings are all oil in water\nemulsions, butter and margarine are\nwater in oil emulsions. The emulsifier\nimproves consistency and texture.\nAnother function is to reduce the\nquantity of fat required to produce a desired effect in food. They are often\nadded to foods which would\notherwise require high levels of fat for\ntheir production, such as ice cream\nand cakes.\nFIRMING AGENTS\nFirming agents prevent food such as\nfruit and vegetables from softening\nand falling apart in extreme conditions\nsuch as canning or freezing. Hence,\nthey help to maintain the firm or crisp\nnature of the food.\nFLOUR IMPROVERS\nFlour improve rs extend the elastic\nproperties and aid the development of\ndough in bread making. They also\naccelerate the bleaching of white flour\nby bleaching agents.\nFREEZANTS\nFreezants extract heat from food\nwhich is consequently frozen by\ndirect contact.\nGLAZING AGENTS\nGlazing agents produce a sheen on the\nsurface of, for example,\nconfection ary and also provide a protective coating.\nHUMECTANTS\nHumecants retain moisture when\nincorporated into food preventing it\nfrom rapidly becoming dry due to the\nevaporation of the water content.\nThey are often added to\nconfection ary. PROPELLANTS\nPropellants are gasses or volatile\nliquids used to expel foods from\naerosol container, eg cream.\nRAISING AGENTS\nRaising agents promote aeration, thus\nfacilitating a lighter texture and\nincreased volume when used in baked\nproducts.\nRELEASE AGENTS\nRelease agents prevent foods from\nsticking to other surfaces with which\nthey come in contact during\nmanufacture or packaging.\nSTABILISERS\nStabilisers stabilise emulsions,\npreventing the two substances from\nseparating and, as a result, improving\ntexture and consistency. They are\noften present in foods containing\nemulsifiers.\nTHICKENING OR GELLING\nAGENTS\nThickening or gelling agents from\ngels which modify texture and impart\nstability to food. They may be of a starch or gum nature, However, the\nlatter are more expensive and,\ntherefore, less widely used.\nFood additives which\nenhance the flavour or look\nARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS\nArtificial sweeteners are sweetening\nagents other than sugar, which are\nwidely used in low calorie products\nto aid slimming and, at the same time,\nprovide a frequently desired sweet\ntaste.\nCOLOURS\nColours improve product appearance,\ngiving colour to otherwise bland or\npale food, restoring the original\ncolour lost in processing and by\novercoming variations between\ndifferent batches, thus satisfying\nconsumer expectations.\nFLAVOURS/FLAVOUR\nENHANCERS\nFlavours/flavour enhancers improve\nfood acceptability when used in minor\nquantities. They may restore flavours\nlost in processing, supplement bland\nfood, magnify existing flavours or\nenhance the natural flavour.\nConcentrated natural flavours are\nprovided as extracts or essential oils,\nwhereas flavour enhancers or\nmodifiers intensify existing flavours\n13?\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198857 "

See\nyou next year! (Except Dai\nWlliams).\nMalcolm\napologise s and\nexplains tactics\nDear Judith,\nAndrew Haisley suggested I might reply to his letter,\npublished last week.\nAn apology is merited and I make it wholeheartedly.\nAn explanation is a bit harder to come by, since the\ncatalogue of errors he sets out is indefensible. What is\nworse is that he was not the only person to suffer in this\nmanner.\nI have apologised promptly and (I hope) sensitively to\nvery one affected, sending copies also to the Registrar,\nSenior Tutor, Warden etc, lest any stain should unjustly\nremain on their characters.\nI do not think I should take up valuable space in your\nfinal issue with a blow-by-blow account of how the errors\noccurred. In any case, I doubt I could make it half as\namusing as Andrew Haisley's letter. Suffice it to say that\nall practical steps that can be taken to avoid this sort of\nthing rec cur ring are being taken.\nIt may, however, be useful to add a few words about\nthe reasons for letters of the sort I( wrongly) sent to Mr\nHaisley.\nUnpaid bills are a major problem for the Students'\nResidence Account. Debt collecting is always a thankless\ntask, and it is particularly unpleasant when the debts have\nto be collected from students whom one knows full well\nhave difficulties in managing on their grant support. It\nnevertheless has to be done, if the rents for College rooms\nare not to be pushed even higher by the need to cover bad\ndebts.\nSome of this year's problems have arisen from human\nerror, some from the administration's well-known\ncomputer problems which are currently being remedied.\nBut I can understand how some of the problems with\nunpaid bills arise simply from the increasing financial\ndifficulties under which many students labour. Some of\nthem simply cannot afford to pay.\nThe Rector and other senior officers take every\nopportunity to press this point with the Government, but\nas yet their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. The College\nitself can do very little to help, both because it is\ncircumscribed by financial regulations imposed by the\nGovernment, and because it has severe problems balancing\nits own budget.\nBut whether a student can't pay or won't pay, we\nnevertheless owe it to other students who do to use every\nconceivable means to recover debts which are due.\nExperience has shown that, if they are to be effective, debt-chasing letters have to be firm and to the point. Of course,\nthis makes it all-the-more unfortunate when they are\nwrong.\nMy letters dated 18 May have in fact resulted in some\n\u00a3 2 0 , 0 0 0 being received by the Students Residence\nAccounts, some of which would undoubtedly never have\nbeen collected otherwise.\nMr Haisley is right to remark that it is a serious matter\nto threaten to stop someone's degree. It is precisely for\nthis reason that the sanction is so effective. (Incidentally,\ninvoking College Regulation No 2 does not mean that a student is deprived of his degree in perpetuity. It simply\nmeans that the result is not announced, and tb award\nwithheld, until the debt is cleared.)\nIt is arguable that we should have carried out further\nchecks before threatening to invoke the Regulation. One\nthing we shall certainly do in future is to send at least one\nearlier reminder letter to the student's parental or home\naddress, just in case the student is no longer living where\nwe think. (This appears to have been the root cause of\nthe problems in Mr Haisley's case.) And we shall continue\nto try to antic i pte other loopholes in our sy.,tem, difficult\nthough that can be.\nI do not offer administrative error or convenience by\nway of defence or mitigation for the error in sending\nAndrew Haisley such a threatening letter. It was plainly\nindefensible. But I hope this letter may help others to\nappreciate why we appear sometimes to adopt such\naggressive debt collecting tactics.\nYours sincerely,\nMalcolm Aldridge, Assistant Finance Officer.\nMangled story?\nDear Judith,\nMangled Story\nI have great admiration for students who give their time\nand talents to productions such as 'Phoenix', especially\nwhen busy with important projects such as third-year\nprojects. Tight deadlines may limit the time for th oro gh proof-reading, but there is little point in producing such\npublications at all if insufficient care makes them\nincomprehensible to their readers.\nWhen I sent my story, 'Premium Blonde and the second\ncoming', to 'Phoenix', I offered to proof-read it if used:\nthe offer was not taken up. My pleasure at seeing it\npublished, in the issue contained in FELIX of 3rd June,\nquickly vanished when I saw the dreadful errors wrecking\nthe sense of continuity of the story. It would take a very\ndetermined reader to work out that the tale jumps from\nprinted column 3, line 46, to column 4, line 15, to column\n6, lint 1. Surely even one casual read-through by typist\nor Editor, should have spotted such major disruptions in\nthe middle of other sentences? It is not even a case of\nprinting the pages out of order: the mix-up is far more\nthorough!\nTyping errors changing the meanings include: not/no,\nnow/not ('Now if you like' changed to 'not if you like'),\nif/it, her/he, her/his, hum/him, of/or, then/the, it/I, it's/ is,\nloaves/leaves. The handwriting in the manuscript is clear\nat each of these points (what ?\u2014TS). Such stories can take\na long time to write, to set in type, and even to read: a modicum of care by the producers can render all these\nefforts worthwhile; lack of checking can render them\nuseless, making writer and editor appear incompetent.\nIt would also be useful to have the date and year on\nthis 'Phoenix', as on past issues. I hope that this literary\nmagazine, now beyond its centenary, gets the required\nEditor for next year.\nWith best wishes for its future,\nYours sincerely,\nDr Bernard Lamb.\nAs Liz Holford, the Phoenix Editor, has left IC, 1 was\nunable to get a reply from her. We did read the original\ncopy and the whole office is of the opinion that the\nversion we printed was a great deal better.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198877 "

    "content": "Sport A Sports Review of the Year\nby Dominic Strowbridge, FELIX Sports Editor 1988\nSport at Imperial has continued to\nbenefit from the College's affiliation\nto the University Athletic Union\n(UAU) this year.\nTeams from Football, Rugby,\nBadminton, Fencing, Hockey and\nSquash have all reached the knockout stages with the last 16 teams of\ntheir U AU competitions. Football's5 th XI went on to win their cup while\nthe 2nd XI began an impressive\nseason with a170 win over QMC.\nThe Rugby 1st XV dominated their\ncompetition in the Autumn term with\n7 consecutive wins. Badminton won\nthe London College knock-out cup\nconvincingly and the Fencing teams\ndid well despite the drink problems\nof certain members of their team! The\nHockey 1st XI ended their unlucky\nseason when they were knocked out\nof their competition by Bristol. Their\nfortunes were revived by a win in the\nUniversity of London sixes\ntournament. The year finished for the\nfive Squash teams with two moving\nup divisions, one dropping and the\nother two finishing well up.\nKarate Club has shown consistent\nsuccess, doing especially well at the\nBritish Students Karate\nChampionships at Crystal Palace,\nwhere the team finished runners-up.\nJudo have also had a good year:\nhosting the University of London\nIntercollegiate Championships, they\nwere rewarded with a win for the\nladies. Members of this team have\nsince gone on to win medals for the\nUniversity of London in regional\ncompetitions.\nThe Sailing teams remain (almost)\nunbeaten with convincing wins over\nBristol, Kent, Sheffield, Cambridge\nand Southampton, and hold the title\nof best University of London club.\nBoat Club, once again, have\ndominated rowing at University level\nin the country. A win for the cox less four at Henley Royal Regatta in the\nChallenge Cup lead to several\nmembers of the top squad being\nselected for Great Britain crews. The\nfirst two eights won their U AU competitions and have since also had\nnotable successes at Ghent\nInternational Regatta and Nottingham\nover national crews. The novices and\nsenior C crews have also done well\nat their respective levels, with the\nnovices winning the 'Head of the\nRiver' in March. A full range of\ncrews will be entering this year's Henley Regatta in the next couple of\nweeks, ensuring the continuation of\nthe Club's success.\nThe Cross Country Club has had an\nactive year especially with the Hyde\nPark Relays, Europe's largest club\nrunning event, in the Autumn term.\nInterest in Orienteering has also\ngrown considerably with a great\nincrease in the involvement and\nenjoyment of this sport. Despite the\nunfortunate clashes of their seasons\nwith exams the Tennis and Cricket\nClubs have both done well to reach\nthe knock-out stages of their\ncompetitions\nThe Sports Editors would like to\nthank team members for regularly\nsending reports to FELIX. Without\nthese contributions, the rest of\nCollege would probably still think that\neveryone disappears home to do yet\nmore problem sheets on a Wednesday\nafternoon, and teams would be cut off\nfrom a valuable source of support.\nWe hope that next year's team\ncaptains continue to write reports and\nencourage more people to get\ninvolved in their sports, at any level.\nTABLE\nTENNIS\nCalling all\nPing Pong\nPlayers\nThe Table Tennis Club is currently\nlooking for people to play in the\nCentral London League next year.\nThis is open to anyone who will be\nat College next year (including staff\nand St Mary's students), although we\nwould particularly like to hear from\npeople who have had experience of\nplaying in a league.\nAs we have to decide how many\nteams to enter by the end of term, we\nwould like to hear from interested\nplayers as soon as possible. Please\ncontact one of the following if you\nwould like to find out more or arrange\na trial:\nLiz Hoskin (Chem Eng pigeonholes)\nPeter Montgomery (Falmouth\nKeogh Hall, int 9411)\nPeter Stott (Mech Eng PG,\nint 6236)\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198875 "

    "content": "Bed is a pleasurable\nplace or a hellish\nnightmare where\nyou toss and turn,\nbattering your\npillow into new,\nsleep-inducing\nforms as the clock\nticks ever on.\nDreams have\nalways been\nconsidered to be\nthe tools of\nprophecy since\nprehistoric times.\nThe bible tells us\nof Joseph who\ndreamt of the Sun\nT>; re are two popular theories about\ndr\ne ams and why we have them. The\nfirst school believes that they are the\nway that the brain disposes of\nunwanted information which has been\nclogging it up. The second school\noe tie ves that they simply provide\nharmless entertainment for the\ndormant brain. It is generally\naccepted by both schools that dreams\ndo not occur in microseconds as\nnineteenth century textbooks\nspeculated, but take 'normal' time to\nrun their courses.\nResearch has also shown that\nexternal factors can enter into our\ndreams. If a telephone rings in the\nbedroom, the subconscious can build\nit into a telephone call in the dream.\nSome people can even experience\nJucid dreams where the dreamer slips\nin and out of the subconscious and\nsemi consciousness while\nincorporating rational ideas into the\ndream, making the dream take the\ncourse the dreamer wishes it to take.\nMany artists and poets claim that their\ndreams have been their inspiration for\ntheir greatest works.\nFreud was very keen on\ninterpreting other people's dreams as\npart of his psychoanalysis\nprogramme. In his book\n'Interpretation of Dreams' he\nrevealed how many dreams have an\nerotic meaning. Here are a few\ncommon dream themes and Freud's interpretation of them:\nSwimming or drowning\u2014Freud\nclaimed that any dream containing\nwater was very sensual\u2014swimming\nwas in fact the sex act and drowning\nwas a yearning for sex.\nBeing chased or being stuck to one\nspot\u2014both of these images are\nsymbolic of the conflict of desire and\ndanger. They symbolise trying to\nescape from something they secretly\ndesire.\nRiding\u2014sex again!\nGuns and knives\u2014these symbolise\nmasculine sexuality. Freud claimed\nthat they were both phallic symbols.\nThe House\u2014the house symbolises the\nhuman body. If you dream of doing\nhousework it is, in fact, revealing\nyour insecurities about your body \"\nyour relationships. If you dream abo\nthe external appearance of the house,\nit is revealing your insecurities about\nyour looks and the way people\nperceive you. Similarly doors\nrepresent openings in the body and\ncorridors symbolise a desire to return\nto the womb. Locks and keys in locks\nare sex again!\nFlying\u2014it is quite a common dream\nto imagine yourself flying under your\nown arm and leg power, as if\nswimming through thin air. This type\nof dream can be interpreted in two\ndifferent ways depending on your\ncircumstances. The first is a thirst for\npower; the second is a need to escape.\nFalling\u2014expresses insecurity and\nanxiety about the future. It is often\ndreamt by people when their\nrelationship with another person is\ncoming to an end.\nNaked\u2014is interpreted as either\nhaving an inferiority complex or\nhaving a desire to be a different sort\nof person.\nFire\u2014this is a very passionate sort of\ndream and warns of the dangers that\ngo with desire.\nCastle\u2014symbolise strength and\npower and is often dreamt about by\nmen who are continuing relationships\nwith strong women.\nMountains\u2014are interpreted to mean\nthat the dreamer is worried about\nmany problems which have to be\novercome.\nAND SO TO BED! and eleven stars\nand interpreted the\nPharoah's dreams.\nDreams have\nintrigued us ever\nsince. Nobody\nknows what dreams\nmean or why they\noccur. The only\ncertain thing is that\nwe only remember\nthem if we wake up\nduring or directly\nafter having one.\nMany of us have experienced\ninsomnia at some time in our lives.\nThe most common causes of\ntemporary insomnia in students are\nexam worries, excessive drinking or\nexcessive eating. The insomnia\nusually lasts one or two days whilst\nthe brain turns over problems or\nsolutions to problems, tries to get over\nthe alcohol invasion or allows the\nbody to cope with the indigestion.\nHowever, some adults suffer\ncontinued insomnia for months, or\neven years at a time. Initially the\nsleeplessness was caused by simple\nproblems but then the insomnia\nbecame the problem and it fuelled\nitself.\nExperiments on volunteer students\nat Loughborough University by Dr\nJim Home have shown that the\naverage student only needs six and a half hours sleep each night. He\nbelieves that people have been conned\ninto believing that they need the full\neight hours every night. He says that\nmost insomnia is perceived rather\nthan actual.\nThere are conflicting views on\nsleeping pills. 'Vallium's fine if you\ntake it when you need it say once\nevery three days, but if you abuse it,\nyou become dependent, you can't sleep properly without it.'\nThere are several natural methods\nto overcome sleeplessness.\nHomeopaths strongly recommend a camomile tea to help you unwind,\nwhereas acupuncturists can help you\nto learn muscle relaxation techniques.\nSome more radical doctors\nrecommend that you should only ever\nsleep in your bedroom. Everything\nelse should take place in other parts\nof the house. But what if you are a humble student and live in a bed-sit?\nDr Home has spent most of his life\nstudying sleep patterns. He has firm\nideas about sleep and dreams. He\nclaims that it is only the brain which\nneeds sleep and that the rest of the\nbody can be without it if it gets the\nnecessary rest and food.\nThere are several cycles to the sleep\npattern. Every person has their own\nindividual pattern. We can general is e by saying that the first two-thirds of\nsleep period consists of both deep and\nlight sleep and the last third consists\nonly of light sleep. Each cycle ends\nwith a period of Rapid Eye Movement\nwhere most of the dreaming occurs\nand the average student's cycle lasts\nabout 90 minutes.\nDr Home believes that deep sleep\nrestores the brain, and in particular,\nthe upper part of the brain, the rest\nobtained also re vital is es the body.\nThe Prime Minister Mrs Margaret\nThatcher goes with just four hours of\nsleep a night. Dr Home says that this\nisn't turning the PM slowly mad; she\nis just missing out on the light sleep.\nPeople who naturally sleep shorter\nhours have the same amount of deep\nsleep but less light sleep than those\nthat get their full eight hours.\nWhatever can be said about sleep,\nwhen it comes and is uninterrupted\nfor six or so hours, it is one of the\nmost enjoyable experiences on this\nearth!\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198847 "

    "content": "SOLAR in South London aimed to\nprovide a community service, not\nonly broadcasting community\nannouncements, news and traffic, but\nactually getting groups in the\ncommunity to put their own points of\nview. Clearly this was limited by the\nstation being illegal, but they showed\nthat it could be done.\nAt the same time, the campaign for\nlegal community radio began, as a development of the Annan Report\nsuggestion that non-profit making\ntrusts be licenced to provide a community radio service. At first the\ncampaign was led by the Community\nCommunications Group (ComCom)\nand later by the Community Radio\nAssociation (the CRA).\nAgain and again the campaign has\nrun up against the refusal of the State\nto give up on control of the airwaves.\nThis is demonstrated by the DTI\npolicy of 'raiding' pirate stations.\nFirst on the list come stations causing\ninterference to legal stations\u2014this\nrarely happens as it is not in the\npirates' interests to interfere. Next,\nit appears, come politically sensitive\nstations\u2014ethnic stations like London\nGreek Radio are repeatedly raided\nwhile soul stations go for months\nwithout a visit. It seems that it is OK\nto put out alternative music, but not\nalternative views and opinions.\nIn cities, the greatest need for new\nradio services is from the ethnic\ngroups. There is virtually no coverage\nof non-British cultures and languages\non the radio (or TV) and the\nbackgrounds of the members of these\ngroups make it particularly difficult\nto gain access to the traditional media.\nMany see radio as a very important\nway of keeping their own culture and\nof promoting harmony with other\ncultures. There is no doubt that they\nhave a very strong need for new radio\nservices\u2014this has even been\nrecognised by the Government. Many\nof the pirates are 'ethnic': Greek and\nArab pirates have been particularly\nsuccessful despite repeated raids.\nCommunity radio is an umbrella\nterm which covers all radio broadcast\nto a particular community\u2014either a community living in a small area, or\none having the same interest. The\nscale of such radio is much smaller\nthan the local stations of the IBA and\nBBC: a station might cover an area\nlike Kensington, perhaps.\nTrue community radio is run by a committee elected from the\ncommunity itself. It seeks to break\ndown the barriers between the\nbroadcasters and the audience, by\nencouraging the audience to take part\nin running their station (a good\nexample of this is Radio Thamesmead, which broadcasts via cable). So\nthat the station truly serves the\ncommunity, it should not aim to make\na profit\u2014ILR has shown the effect of\ncommercial aims on station output.\nCommunity radio would also offer\nsomething different from pop music\nall day. For example, a community-of-interest music station could\nconcentrate on jazz for example but,\ninstead of DJ patter, its presenters\nwould be genuinely interested and\nknowledgable about the music played.\nThis is what community radio\nmeans to the CRA, as well as to\nAustralia, the USA and other\ncountries throughout the world. In\nBritain, however, the Government\ndoes not recognise the difference\nbetween the no-profit, community-type station and the scaled down ILR\nstations which aim for profit. In the\nUK, the words community radio are\nthus used to cover both types of small\nscale radio.\nThe French and Italian experiences\nhave been enlightening. Their\nairwaves were opened up to anyone\nwho wanted to broadcast and\nthousands of stations were set up.\nAfter four years of competition for\nadvertising only the popular misi c stations were left, most of wh i cn had\nmerged with other stations or been\nbought out. Competition for\naudiences had reached a level where\n'porn radio' could be received in\nsome areas. The warning is clear:\ncompetition does not lead to greater\nchoice in broadcasting. It leads to\nthen followed six months of delay to\nsee who would receive the licences.\nWhen the announcement did come,\nit was that the experiment was going\nto be cancelled because it was felt it\nwould be impossible to regulate the\n21 stations if they were licenced\ndirectly by the Home Office and\ntherefore by the Government. What\nwe have heard since indicates that this\ndecision came from Cabinet level.\nOn cancelling the experiment, the\nGovernment promised a re-think in\nradio and offered a Green Paper (a consultative document) which was\nreleased in Autumn '87. The paper\nsuggested the setting up of small scale\nradio throughout the country, as well\nas three National Channels of\nBroadcasting\u2014similar to Radios 1,2,.\n3 and 4, but to be run commercially.\nHome Secretary Douglas Hurd later\nannounced that a new 'Radio\nAuthority' would be set up. This\nwould be separate from the current\nIBA and have the job of regulating all\nthe non-BBC stations. This change\nshould be presented to Parliament\nsoon in a general Radio Bill. The\nAuthority would cost around \u00a31-1 \u00a5i million (roughly what is spent trying\nto stop the pirates) and would take\nover the regulation of ILR stations,\nas well as licencing the proposed new\nstations.\nThe timetable was to have been as\nfollows: the Bill would be presented\nfit in? In the late 1960s, student\nstations were licenced on strict\ncondition that they could only be\nreceived by students\u2014hence\nremoving regulation worries. This is\nwhy IC Radio only broadcasts to\nSouthside and Linstead. Their signal\n(which like all student stations is on\nMedium Wave) is confined by the\nsteel frame of the building so it cannot\nbe picked up by the mews residents\non the other side of the road. IC Radio\nis the only student station to be\nlicenced in such a built-up area.\nThe only changes since then have\nbeen that advertising (which most\nstations now take) is now allowed\nand, very recently, that a 'Test and\nDevelopment Licence' has been\ngranted to enable IC Radio and Radio\nFalmer in Sussex to broadcast to\nstudents on the FM band.\nThe future of radio is uncertain the\nconflict between the Conservative\npolicy of deregulation and ^he\ndetermination to keep control of the\nmedia may result in some interesting\ncompromises. I'm sure many people\ndon't realise the scale of the effects\nthe changes will bring.\nFinally, I can't claim this is\nunbiased\u2014I am involved in one of the\nmajor pressure groups for change-but I think it gives a background and\nintroduction to many of the issues\nsurrounding radio broadcasting today.\nmany stations going for the same\naffluent audience and no service for\nanyone else. Even the relevant\nParliamentary Subcommittee seems to\naccept this.\nBack in 1986, the then Home\nSecretary Leon Brittan announced a one year experiment in 'community\nradio' (actually small scale radio),\nwith 21 stations to be licenced to try\nout the idea. Given only a few months\nwarning, 277 applications were\nreceived for the 21 licences. There\nto Parliament this Autumn, the Radio\nAuthority would be set up next year,\nand the first licences issued by next\nChristmas. However, in the last\nfortnight we have heard that the\nGovernment (and the Home Office in\nparticular), is very short of\nparliamentary time in the Autumn. It\nlooks increasingly likely that the Bill\nwill not be presented in 1988, so the\nwhole timetable will be pushed back\nyet another year.\nSo, where do stations like IC Radio\nFurther information:\nIBA, Brompton Road, London\nSW7.\nBBC, Broadcasting House, London.\nCommunity Radio Association,\nRoom 119, Southbank House,\nBlack Prince Road, London SE1.\nIC Radio, Southside, Prince's Gardens.\nHome Office, Queen Anne's Gate,\nLondon.\n40 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "wT & #\n3\n1\nXU I \u20acZJ Sr> broadcasts began on February 14th,1922. Other companies soon began\nfighting for licences to transmit and\nmanufacture receivers.\nThe Government, worried about\nthe Bolshevik Revolution close to\nhome, ruled out the commercial\nanarchy of the US-style, de centralised system. They wanted to keep central\ncontrol of broadcasting\u2014but from a distance. This apparent contradiction\nhas been part of British broadcasting\npolicy ever since. They persuaded the\nbroadcasters to form a consortium,\nwhich would be run as a public utility\nlike water, gas or the Post Office.\nThis became The British Broadcasting\nCorporation; its first Directory\nGeneral was John Reith.\nBy supporting the Government line\nduring the General Strike in 1926, the\nBBC managed to avoid being taken\nover by the Home Secretary who,\nincidentally, was Winston Churchill.\nReith later wrote: 'they know they can\ntrust us not to be impartial.' The\nabsence of newspapers during the\n. Strike also gave the young\nCorporation a national audience just\n.v hen it was needed.\n\"The BBC developed into a domestic diplomatic service,\nrepresenting the British to the\nBritish.\" Tom Burns\u2014The BBC\nPublic Institution, Private World\n(1977). When Reith left the BBC in\n1938, he was congratulated by one\nnewspaper for 'making the BBC as\nthoroughly typical and representative\nas the Bank of England'.\nIn the meantime, US-style popular\nradio was coming in from abroad.\nRadios Luxembourg and Normandie\nwere set up in about 1934 with a brief\nto find out the programmes an\naudience was not allowed to listen to,\nthen broadcast them from stations\noutside the country concerned. Both\nwere financed by advertising.\n' During World War Two, with\nLuxembourg and Normandie shut\ndown and the BBC confining itself to\nnews and serious music, British\naudiences were entertained by Lord\nHaw-Haw\u2014a pro pog and is t called\nWilliam Joyce, who worked for the\nNazis. By the end of 1939, 30% of\nthe country listened to him regularly.\nIn concession to popular taste the\nBBC Forces programme was started,\nfeaturing singers such as Vera Lynn.\nThe war gave radio a great boost,\nboth in audiences and in technology.\nBy its end, having heard the American\nForces radio stations throughout the\nworld, thousands had become familiar\nwith US pop music programmes.\nThey then demanded the same from\ntheir own broadcasters.\nIn 1949 the Wireless Telegraphy\nAct was passed, prohibiting\nbroadcasts without a licence; five\nyears later the first transistor radio\nwent on sale in the USA. Aside from\nthis, however, progress was slow, as\nbroadcasters turned their attentions to\nthe new medium of television.\nIn the years around 1960, pirate\nstations began to broadcast from\noutside territorial waters in the North\nSea, to South and East England.\nThings did not start to move though\nuntil 1964, when an Irish businessman\ncalled Ronan O 'Reilly set up Radio\nCaroline. Caroline played records the\nlisteners otherwise could not hear in\nthe UK and gained an audience of\nseven million in its first month. The\n1967 Marine Offences Act, however,\nlimited the pirates, since under she\nAct it is illegal to supply or to\nadvertise on an offshore pirate station.\nAt the same time as the Act was\nintroduced, BBC Radio 1 started and\nseveral DJs from the pirates were\nemployed. Thirty-one BBC local\nstations were also set up and financed\nby the licence fee. Apart from Radio\nCaroline, the offshore pirates\nvanished almost overnight.\nIn 1971, commercial pressures\npersuaded the Government to publish\na Bill putting radio which was\nindependent from the BBC under the\nwing of the IBA. Like the BBC, the\nIBA has a board of trustees appointed\nby the Government, who are\n'safeguarded of the national interest',\nand have strict controls over what\nthey can allow to be broadcast.\nAgain, in the setting up of the IBA\n(originally for television), the State\nshowed that it was not prepared to\nlose control of the broadcasting\nservice. This paranoia means, for\nexample, that if you want to set up\ni newspaper and deliver it to people's homes, nobody will stop you.\nHowever, try and convey the same\nmessage by radio and you run up\nstraight against the law, broadcasting\nregulations, contra in ts and all the rest.\nThe Annan Report of 1977 led to\nan expansion of the BBC and ILR\nlocal services to cover more of the\nUK, but once into the 80s the going\nfor the ILR stations (who provide\nprogrammes on a 'franchise' from the\nIBA) got a lot tougher. A lot of them,\nespecially in the smaller coverage\nareas, found difficulty in finding\nenough advertising income to keep\ngoing. The trend of cutting back on\nthe expensive news and documentary\nservices the ILR stations had\npromised in their applications was\naccelerated. In their place were Top\n40 programmes, to attract the largest\naudience, and cheap phone ins.\nThe IBA has done little to keep the\nILR companies to their promises,\nconsidering that it has a duty to watch\nover its franchise holders as well as\nregulate them. It even has a system\nwhere the rich stations sub sid is e the\npoorer ones. It would argue that a station broadcasting what they can\nafford is better than no station at all.\nThe increasing deregulation of the\nILR stations and lack of advertising\nrevenue has forced stations to go for\nthe largest market for their\nadvertisers\u2014providing a service to\nthe public is only secondary. This\nmarket is for Top 40 music, and this\nis what the majority of the ILR\nstations aim at\u2014it is said that the only\nlocal part of ILR is the traffic reports!\nThere has also been a trend of the\nmore successful ILR stations to take\nover or buy up the less successful\nones: Capital Radio, the most\nsuccessful station, owns Devon Air\nin the South West; Red Rose Radio\nowns Radio Aire in Leeds and Red\nDragon in Cardiff and so on. ILR\nStations in the same area have also got\ntogether to form 'Networks' so that\none station provides a service that is\nput out on all of them. The Yorkshire\nRadio Network consists of Radio\nAire, Hallam in Sheffield and\nHumberside's Viking Radio. This\ncuts costs at the expense of a local\nservice, but if all they broadcast is pop\nmusic this doesn't really matter.\nThe early 80s saw another\nimportant development in radio: the\nland-based pirate station. The\ntechnology to transmit on the FM band is now sufficiently cheap as to\nmake it possible\u2014and even easy\u2014to\nset up your own pirate station, and\nthis began to happen once the\npotential was seen. The Department\nof Trade and Industry (DTI) division\ncharged with controlling the airwaves\nhas been swamped ever since.\nThe first of these pirates were\nblack. They wanted to bring soul and\nreggae to the airwaves and there was\nno outlet on the legal services. Like\nCaroline in the 60s, they set up their\nown stations as it was the only way\nthey had of getting their music played.\nPirates like JBC, Horizon and LWR\nhave been going ever since.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198839 "

    "content": "E LIX So you've nearly got to the end of this\nedition of FELIX. Congratulations! If\nI'm allowed to use a clich e,I hope\nthat you've enjoyed reading the\nnewspaper as much as I 've enjoyed\nediting it over the past year.\nNow is the time to start reminiscing\nabout the past academic year and\nlooking forward to the years ahead.\nI was particularly pleased that both\nthe Rector and Union Manager David\nPeacock could find time to write\narticles for this issue. I must say that\nI find it sad that Professor Ash has\nresigned himself to the fact that\nImperial College will be 60%\nprivatised by the year 1993. Slightly\nmore heartening was the fact that\nDavid managed to devoted a large\npart of his article to the Union's welfare role along with the services\nhe would like to see introduced.\nThere are other articles which I could highlight from this issue but as\nyou should have read it all already,\nit's a bit pointless isn't it?\nWhy did I decide to go for an\neighty-four page issue? Well, it's always been a sort of thing with\nFELIX editors and their last issue.\nSince I 've been at College, each\neditor has always tried to beat the\nrecord number of pages for an\nindividual issue. The record up to last\nyear was forty pages. It would have\nbeen quite enough to go up to forty-four this year. But as my ego is\nprobably greater than even Ian\nHowgate's,I decided that I would try\nto get out an issue that could not be\nbeaten by any of my successors.\nPerhaps in several years time people\nwill read this year's bound edition and\nchuckle at this attempt, having\nwitnessed hundred page Fresher\nFELIX or the like. But I would still\nlike to think that this one will take a lot of beating.\nI couldn't have done it without my\nstaff of course, who took up my\nambitious idea and rallied round to\nproduce what I like to think as one\nof the best student newspapers in this\ncountry. But I'm biased.\nFELIX has come a long way in the\nlast fourteen years since the Editor\nbecame a sabbatical and the Union\ntook on its own print unit. I think we\nhave reached something of a turning\npoint in its life.\nEarlier this year Publications Board\nset up a working party to look at the\nfuture of the Print Unit. The problem\nthis year has been that we have taken\non so much College work as well as\nUnion print work and FELIX has\nbeen so big that the Printer was\nworking up to ten hours a week\novertime. Something had to be done.\nWe had the choice to expand or\ncontract. We couldn't stay as we\nwere.\nThe Working Party debated many\ndifferent options but finally decided\nthat we could not afford to expand.\nThe only direction was contraction.\nHojvever, David Peacock would\nlike to see a Union Print Shop set up.\nHe is keen to point out that this does\nnot necessarily mean taking over our\nPrint Unit. For if it did, I wo'ul d fight\nit for all my job was worth. But even\nif there was a separate Union Print\nUnit to the FELIX Print Unit, it\nwould still have a dramatic effect on\nFELIX as a newspaper. How could\nwe justify keeping the Editor a sabbatical if he had no Print Unit to\nrun for half the week? How could we\nafford to produce twenty-four page\nissues each week if all our profit-making work is removed?\nEven more disturbing is the recent\ntrend within the Union to make the\nFELIX Editor a 'secondary'\nsabbatical. Certain union officers\nwould like to see a Union committee\nedit our newspaper and the fourth\nsabbatical would just produce the\nthing plus all the other random Union\npublicity that they required.\nAs I write this editorial early on\nTuesday morning, I have heard\nrumours that they're 'out to get\nFELIX' at today's Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting. By the meeting, this\nlast issue will have been sent off to\nbe stapled and trimmed. My job as\nFELIX Editor is nearly over. I hope\nthat they are only rumours and that\nthe Union doesn't try to gain more\ninfluence in the content of FELIX. I wouldn't like to have to say in x years\ntime that I was the last editor to be\neditorially free.\nIf FELIX lost its editorial freedom,\nthere would be no point in having a newspaper. But I will have to leave\nthe Cat in the capable hands of Bill\nGoodwin, next year's FELIX Editor,\nwho will have far more trouble trying\nto defend his freedom when the\nPublications Board Chairman doesn't believe in it.\nFELIX this year\nI 've been generally very happy with\nFELIX this year. We have managed\nto get out what I think have been the\nbest possible issues we could have\nproduced given the constraints of\ntime, money, labour, and machinery.\nThe machinery has been the worst\npart to cope with. Not one piece of\nit in this office has been 100% reliable\nall year. My major disappointment\nhas been with our newest equipment.\nThe litho would usually break down\nevery third week\u2014if we were lucky!\nIn fact, as I'm writing this final\neditorial, the damned thing is playing\nup once more and it looks as if we're\nall going to have a very long night.\nDespite the trials and tribulations\nof the Print Unit, FELIX has come\nout to schedule every time. This has\nbeen due to the dedication of the\nFELIX staff. This was one of the\nreasons that I became so irate when\nCouncil referred back the\nPublications Board colours last\nmonth. They said that FELIX had\nawarded too many and so devalued\nthe colours for the rest of the clubs\nand societies. This is utter rot!\nWe have a duty to get an issue of\nFELIX out each Friday. To do this\nwe are given the equipment, the\nEditor, the permanent Printer and the\nTypesetter Operator by the Union. If\nit was left up to just these three\npeople, you would pick up, at most,\nan eight page FELIX every week\u2014\nand that would be pushing it a bit!\nThis year we managed an average\nof about 24 pages every week. The\nother sixteen pages, coming from\nvolunteer student labour. Student staff\nhave been writing the features and the\nnews stories, pasting up, collating and\ndistributing. And at the end of the\nyear, all that I can give them is lousy\nsocial colours and a credit in FELIX.\nThe difference between FELIX and\nHockey Club, say, is that if the team\nall come down with 'flu, then the\nmatch is postponed. If the FELIX\nteam all come down with 'flu, we still\nhave to carry on and get the\nnewspaper out.\nThis is getting to sound incredibly\nsycophantic. It is something that has\nto be said because I appreciate the\nhelp that I have been given by so\nmany people at this College. I would\nlike to take this opportunity to single\nout a few of the people that have\nhelped FELIX and the Print Unit this\nyear:\nChris Martin\u2014has been invaluable\nthis year. His major role has been as\nFELIX Business Manager, but his\ninvolvement hasn't stopped there. He\nhas been my expert folder,\nphotocopier man and chief\ndistributor. He has helped me in every\nway he could this year and if the\nFELIX Editor could award the\nequivalent of the President's Union\nGeneral Award, I would not hesitate\nin giving one to Chris. I wish him\nevery success with his writing up.\nPippa Salmon\u2014has been an\ninvaluable Deputy throughout the\nyear. If I had one regret about relying\non her so much, it would be that as\na result she has decided to leave her\ncourse temporarily. Pippa is the office\nangel. She has a knack of knowing\nexactly when to offer you that much\nneeded cup of tea. She's also a dab\nhand at pasting up, collating and sub\nediting copy. I hope that she enjoys\nher new job next year.\nKamala Sen\u2014has been my expert\nproof-reader and folder. She is\nanother one of those dedicated souls\nthat has spent a bit too much time in\nthe FELIX Office and has also\ndecided to retake her final year next\nsession. I received a letter a few\nweeks ago congratulating FELIX on\nits improved spelling and this has\nbeen almost entirely down to Kamala.\nI also wish her every success for next\nyear.\nOther people who deserve special\nmentions are Al Birch for his\nsignificant collating work; Steve\nBlack for an excellent science page\neach week; William Lumb for\nkeeping us up-to-date with what's been happening at St Mary's; Paul\nShanley for being a constant source\nof amazement; Dominic Strowbridge\nand Henry Sullivan for being\nexcellent Sports Editors; Andrew\nWaller for being a star; Andrew\nClarke, Sumit Guha, Ashley Niblock\nand Charles Robin for maintaining\nsuch a quality reviews section; and\nAdrian Bourne for all the hard work\nhe put in over the year.\nA special mention must go to the\ntwo members of permanent staff:\nDean and Rose. Dean has been so\nflexible and worked so many extra\nhours under such intolerable work\nconditions that I'm continually\namazed as to how he survives! Rose\nhas been quietly efficient and it's also\nher birthday today, so I'd like to take\nthis opportunity to wish her many\nhappy returns and have a happy one!\nThis week's FELIX\nThis week's FELIX would not have\nbeen possible if not for:\nNews Editor: Bill Goodwin\nDeputy Editor: Pippa Salmon\n80 Wednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "completely different to Einstein's, so\ndifferent that they cannot be\nconsidered true in any sense\n(observations based on them are\napproximately true in some\ncircumstances but in the crucial\nexperiments Newton fails).\nEinstein's model too may someday\nfail to achieve a majority in the\nparliament of observations. The same\nis true of all models used by all\nscientists. So we can never be certain\nthat we have reached the ultimate\ntruth.\nMany scientists were eager to\nreceive and practice Popper's methods, but many others were\ndisturbed by the apparent loss of the\nconcept of truth. However, the\ndiscoveries of quantum mechanics\ngave an immense boost to non-realist\ninterpretations of reality. Quantum\nreality is just so observably crazy that\nit is difficult to maintain a naive view\nof reality any more. The fundamental\nentities of QM are no longer\nanalogous to concrete objects in the\nmacroscopic world. Quantum logic\ndoes not have the same set of rules\nas the Newtonian solar system (at\nleast not while you are sober). The\nnearest we can get to quantum reality\nis mathematical models. So we are\nalmost forced to concede the ultimate\nin sc ru tabl it y of reality.\nThe problem with\npeople\nWe do not normally, in our everyday\nlife, encounter quantum objects. In\nfact a realist and Newtonian model is\nfairly sufficient for our everyday\nneeds (but this does not make it true\nin any useful sense). Human intuition,\nbased on the macroscopic well-behaved world is based on a simplistic\nview of reality. So there is a sort of\nbuilt-in resistance to the new ideas.\nThe same goes for the philosophy of\nscience. People tend to cling to the\nidea that they are uncovering truth\nrather than just finding a better model.\nSo when someone questions their idea\nthey defend it with passionate zeal.\nScientific disputes then become like\nthe deadly disputations between\nmedieval theologians. Scientists take\nattacks on their ideas in the same way\nthey take attacks on their integrity:\nafter all they think truth is what is at\nstake.\nSuch resistance to novelty is\napparently part of human nature, but\nit gets in the way of scientific\nadvance. There is a natural human\ntendency to want to be on the right\nside of an argument. When this is\n\u2022p plied in science it leads to scientists\nrefusing to articulate clear ideas for\nfear of being wrong; they prefer to\nobfuscate and hedge their bets so that\nthey never have to face being clearly\nmistaken. Yet science would move\nmore quickly if people were prepared\nto stick their necks out more often.\nBold, clearly expressed theories\nencourage clear-cut experiments, but\nthey therefore run a high risk of being\nproved incorrect.\nAnother problem is that old fogies\nin positions of power cling to the old\nideas with which they are comfortable\nand block the rapid acceptance of new\nideas. Often in many areas of science\nnew ideas fail to be widely accepted\nuntil the people who thought up the\nprevious set of theories have the\ncourtesy to kick the bucket. People\nwho believe they have found the truth\nare very stubborn even in the face of\nstrong evidence to the contrary.\nScience cannot easily afford such\nresistance to change.\nIndeed, the modern world (of\ncomputers and digital watches) would\nnot yet have arrived if scientists had\nheld on to a belief in the truth of the\nclassical world-view that pre cee ded quantum mechanics. The transistor,\nfor example, is completely\ninexplicable in the classical model of\nreality. Not that there was no\nresistance, Boltzmann committed\nsuicide in 1908 because of the\nresistance to his ideas of statistical\nmechanics (and this was three years\nafter the Einstein paper on the subject\nthat ultimately nailed the lid on the\nclassical coffin).\nThomas Kuhn actually built a whole philosophy of science on such\naberrations of human nature. He built\nhis philosophy on what actually\nhappens so he emphasises the human\nresistance to change. What tends to\nhappen, according to his ideas, is that\nobservations at variance with the\naccepted wisdom build up over a period of time. Eventually the sheer\nweight of evidence is against the old\nideas and they suddenly collapse in\na traumatic episode known as a paradigm shift. Kuhn's ideas tell us\na lot about the basic stubbornness of\nhuman nature without telling us how\nto get round the problem. It is often\nbetter to think of Kuhn as a sociologist\nof science rather than as a philosopher.\nDoubt is good\nA Popperian approach makes\nscientific advance easier precisely\nbecause it relinquishes its grasp on\ntruth. The job of science is, now, to\nbuild models. Good models suggest\nnew experiments, the results of the\nexperiments say whether the models\nare going to survive. Models are\nmental constructs, they are simply\nanalogies which can usefully describe\nsome portion of the world. There is\nno point in getting too attached to an\nanalogy. In fact, the best models are\nthe ones that have invited the most\ncriticism.\nA healthy dose of doubt keeps old\nideas on their toes. Constant criticism\nimposes a harsh selective pressure\nthat weeds out inadequate concepts.\nScientists should be open to critical\nideas as those very ideas are the\ndriving force for scientific advance.\nIf a theory fails under criticism, then\nit will be replaced by something\nbetter; if it survives then we have\nmore reason to trust it.\nPopper basically presented us with\nan idealistic view of how science\nshould be done. If we did science the\nway he suggests we might actually do\nit better and with less personal\nbickering. Many very successful\nscientists have been ardent disciples\nof the Popper method and, since some\nof them got Nobel prizes as a result,\nperhaps we should take their ideas\nseriously. One of the things we have\nto do is to get away from the naive\nidea of absolute truth. New science\nwill never appear if we cling on to\nconventional ideas too much, so we\nmust abandon truth and\ninstitutional is e doubt. We have to\nlearn to be critical of all scientific\ntheories. It is the asking of awkward\nquestions that suggests the new\nexperiments that prompt new science.\nThe more questions we are prepared\nto ask, the faster science will advance.\nPopper's ideas have other\nimplications. They provide a fairly\nstrict way to keep nasty ideologies are\ncompletely irrefutable in the face of\nany imaginable evidence and are held\nfor completely irrational reasons. The\ncriterion of falsifiability also\nconveniently relegates astrology and\ntelepathy to the realm of\npseudoscience (believers are\nnotoriously unwilling to do critical\nexperiments and can always find a way out when the experiments fail).\nSo what?\nThe job of the scientists is to make\nmodels of the world that transcend his\nown limitations.\nHave we lost a belief in reality and\ntruth as a result of Popper's ideas?\nNot really. Nothing in his philosophy\nsays that there is not t nith or that there\nis no reality. He is just reminding us\nthat human perception is not a perfect\ntool for appreciating either reality or\ntruth. Yes you can have an objective\nreal world, but you can never build\na perfect model of it. Yes, absolute\ntruth can exist, but people will\ninevitably distort it according to their\nown ends.\nIt is a prevalent and dangerous\nmyth that science offers a better path\nto truth than any other human\ncreation. It does not and it never will.\nScience is a human activity and will\nalways be subject to the problems and\ndistortions of human nature. A good\nscientific philosophy (such as\nPopper's) does its best to counteract\nhuman frailty, but in doing so it\nseverely limits the scope of science\n(we can have no good science without\ncarefully controlled critical\nexperiments). So science is powerless\nwhen faced with the great questions\nof existence (is there a God? Is there\nany point to life? What am I going to\neat for lunch...).\nAnyway, as Richard Feynman said,\n'Science isn't the most important\nthing in the world, Love is.'\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198827 "

    "content": "Does Imperial have a future?\nThe Rector,\nProfessor Eric Ash,\nlooks into his\ncrystal ball and\ntells the future of\nImperial College.\nThe Rector on the fiddle.\nThe Editor has asked me to inform\neveryone as to what the future holds\nfor the College. Of course, I do not\nknow. However having, vicariously,\nenjoyed the hospitality of her columns\nduring the year, I felt that I should not\ndisappoint with quite such an\nuncompromising confession of\nignorance.\nThere are just a few pointers to the\nfuture that can guide us. First of all\nthis College will remain an elite\ninstitution for teaching and research\nin the Sciences and in Engineering as\nwell as. by next session, in Medicine.\nI approve of the concept of 'wider\naccess\", of encouraging a larger\npercentage of the school leave rs to\nparticipate in higher education. But\nwe are restricted by our location from\nhaving greatly expansionist\nambitions. Our role will continue to\nbe the education of exceptionally\ntalented students; the pursuit of world\nclass research.\nThe biggest immediate change is of\ncourse the forthcoming merger with\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School.\nThis will happen first on a formal\nlevel, with much signing of papers\nand speeches by the Great and the\nGood. The real integration lies in the\nhands of real people\u2014the students and\nstaff who will progressively increase\ntheir interaction on all planes. There\nare encouraging signs of this\nhappening already\u2014certainly on the\nresearch scene, but also between the\nstudents' unions. It was notable that\nat the second Summer Fair on\nSunday, the greatest attraction was\nthat provided by the St Mary's students, who were indefatigable in\ntesting cholesterol levels, lung\ncapacity and blood pressure (\n\u2014\nincluding mine; they wanted a record\nboth before and after the merger).\nWe'cannot for long talk about the\nfuture without taking note of the\ncurrent government policy towards\nthe universities. The essential aim is\nto achieve a measure of privatisation.\nImperial College currently derives\nabout half its income from the\nUniversity Grants Committee; the rest\nwe earn\u2014by successfully bidding for\ngrants and contracts, and by student\nfees. It is not unreasonable to suggest\nthat we are about half privatised.\nTwenty years ago we were only a quarter privatised. Looking at the\nslope of this 'privatisation factor'\n(admittedly not necessarily a reliable\nway of foretelling the future) it would\nappear that privatisation is increasing\nat a rate of 2% per annum. I think it\nis highly probably that five years from\nnow we will be 60% privatised. The\nprivatisation may proceed even faster,\nif the government choose to adopt the\nso-called 'voucher' scheme, whereby\nadequately prepared school leave rs will be given a voucher, to cover full\ncost fees, to 'spend' in any university\nof their choice\u2014that is prepared to\naccept them.\nDoes this progressive privatisation\nmatter? I am not concerned with the\nunderlying political convictions\u2014my\npersonal stance is more pragmatic.\nHow will it affect our dual tasks of\nteaching and scholarship? On the\nstudent side\u2014even with vouchers\u2014I do not think it will make too much\ndifference. It will underline the nature\nof the relationship between student\nand university in identifying the\nstudent as the 'customer'\u2014in a financial as well as a functional sense.\nThe College will have to convince\npotential students that Imperial\nCollege is the place where they can\nbest develop their potential. But then\nwe are in that stance already. We\nwant, and will continue to want the\nablest and the most committed. This\nreally is a remarkable place, a remarkable concentration of talent,\nenthusiasm and\u2014eccentricity. I think\nit is worth emphasising, because it is\none thing one can more easily judge\nif, like me, you were a student in the\nWednesday June 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Libel\nFebruary saw the run-up to the rz ens' elections in Cheapskate.\nAnxious to influence the poll in whatever way he could, John\nSecretary threw an impromptu party. He invited Ian Whygate and Nige\nD Butcher for dinner at his house. Whygate was going because he\nwas in the same Bricklayers' Shack as John Secretary. Butcher had\nbeen dying to join so he acc ep+ ed the invitation, too. After the meal,\nNige D Butcher asked John Secretary what he had to do to join.\n'Well,' said John Secretary, 'You have to roll up your trouser leg,\nshow everyone your nipples and chant loads of meaningless words\nover and over again'.\n'Oh, just like a Lumpsofmetalworshippers' bar-night,' said Butcher.\nJust before the\nelections Ian Whygate\ndecided to change his\nname. He was fed up\nwith having a normal\nname like all the other\ncitizens and so he asked\neveryone to start calling\nhim Sidney Spanker\ninstead. Someone put a note up on his office\ndoor:\nIan Whygate was my\nname,\nNow it's Sidney\nSpanker.\nI'm the head of all\nCheapskate,\nBut I am still a xxx xxx The last word was crossed out but everyone had a good idea what\nit should be.\nRob McNorthey, the Cheapskate Head Chef, was in the news that\nmonth as well. He was fed up with the citizens s lagging off his food.\nSo he decided to build another food shop. He already had Bullshit's Pizza Bar, McNorthey's Burger Bar and his school dinner outlets. Now\nhe was opening his latest venture, the Roast-Dog, just above the\ngassy-liquid shop.\nMcNorthey was trying to find someone to look after it for him. He'd seen a very funny man on the television and thought of asking him\nto run it. Unfortunately he got the name muddled and ended up with\nDavros, the head of the Daleks, instead. As a result, Willhebe\nGoodforacolumninch refused to eat in there again.\nThe elections came to Cheapskate. As expected Nige D Butcher\nsigned his name up for Head Citizen. So did Paul Floozie, who thought\nit would be really wacky to stand. He never got as far as the ballot\nbox, though. Like a good Catholic, he pulled out at the last minute.\nBrendan O 'Spud also stood for election but didn't win the vote. A case of the cabbage beating the potato...\nDoctor Who/Willhebe Goodforacolumninch won the election for\nPhallix Editor. All the Phallix staff were very excited by this. They\nnow had an office that was bigger on the inside than it was on the\noutside.\nMay was an eventful month at Cheapskate. Arthur Michael left\nCheapskate for pastures new. Also, the Ghostly Drencher was back\nin town. He (or she) had been going around throwing carrier bags of\nwater over people in locked toilet cubicles. The rumour was that Arthur\nMichael had left before they found out who it really was...\nIn fact a great deal of citizens left Cheapskate that month. The\nCitizen's Head Chef, Normal Nutburger, and his faithful pal Smudge\nWendison had been putting on a lot of weight for the last two years.\nNormal was now so large that he had to be rolled to work every day\nby one of the Foodie slaves. Sidney Spanker was beginning to smell\na rat\u2014which wasn't at all surprising because the rat had been living\nin his moustache for nearly a week already.\nMrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks had also smelt the rat, but she was too\npolite to point it out to her favourite stab-in-the-back-it-all. Finally she\ndecided that the rat had to go because it was putting her off when\nshe took dictation. So she rang up her play pal Dr Bob Groper. Together\nthey devised a cunning plan to remove the rat from the Head Citizen's upper lip and place it in one of Normal's deep freezers. 'This way\nSidney will come out smelling like roses and we can get rid of that\ntroublesome pair in the Foodie Palace,' laughed Mrs Jolly HockeySticks, as she took another sip of sherry. 'We all suspect that Normal\nand Smudge have been eating all our Mars bars up and they've become\nvery fat indeed. I wouldn't be at all surprised if that Judith\nLargeamounts had eaten a Mars bars or two! And Alan Ego has pi^t on at least a stone in the last month. Normal has eaten so much that\nhe cannot do his job properly anymore. When we tell everybody that\na dead rat was found in one of Normal's ratatouille s, there will be\na citizens' revolt and it will give us an excuse to sack Normal. I think\nthat our plan is for the best, my dear.'\nMeanwhile, Sidney was busy explaining to his disciples Neil\nMcCrafty, Atomic Weasel and Neil Moron why he was the best thing\nsince sliced quiche. The disciples were so stupid that they had not\nnoticed that Sidney had a rat living in his moustache. They just thought\nthat the funny smell was because he had eaten Normal's baked beans\nfor lunch.\n'My master plan will make Cheapskate the best place in the land.\nThe only problems are Ego and Largeamounts. They are the only\ncitizens who don't share my vision. Here, have another Mars bar,'\nsaid Sidney.\n'I 've got an idea,' piped \u2022\u2022 Neil Moron. 'Why don't we produce\nan alternative newspaper calle , sol lox which says that Sidney Spanker\nis a really wonderful person and that Largeamounts is a horrible, nasty\nliar.'\n'Brilliant scheme, Moron!' cackled Sidney, rubbing his palms\ntogether in anticipation. 'I'm sure that even Mrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks\ncouldn't have come up with a better plan.'\nSo the new newspaper was brought out by the Sidney Spanker Fan\nClub and it certainly lived up to its name.\nSpanker was finally seeing his dream come true: he knew that he\nwould go down in Cheapskate history as a really great leader. The\nbest one ever, he hoped.\n'Mmm,' said Largeamounts as she studied the news for the last\nissue of Phallix. 'It's all very depressing. Normal and Smudge have\nbeen force ably rolled out of the Citizens' Building for being fat and\nunable to cook ratatouille. Alan Ego is earning pots and pots of money\nin the City. And what am I doing? Scraping around for one decent\nnews story to put in my last issue.'\nLargeamounts was a bit annoyed. The Citizens Media Committee\nhad elected Sidney\nSpanker as Media\nSupremo for the next\nyear and it was the job\nthat Largeamounts felt\nwas rightfully hers.\n'Pissst,' said Paul\nFloozie with a glint in his\neye. 'I 've just made the\nperfect bomb out of an\nold milk bottle, some\nplate fixer and a match. I suggest you stick it up Sidney Spanker's bottom,\nLargeamounts took the bomb from Floozie and left the Phallix\nOffice\n\u2022 Will Largeamounts stick the bomb up Sidney Spanker's bum?\n\u2022 Will Sidney Spanker get his come-up pan ce?0 Will Mr E Baron-Writer pen another letter of complaint?\n\u2022 Why wasn't the Baron of Cheapskate mentioned once throughout\nthe entire episode?\n\u2022 Will he ever return?\n\u2022 All this can only be answered in the next l?) episode of the Baron\nof Cheapskate.\nAll characters contained within the Baron of Cheapskate are\nentirely fictional and bear no resemblance to anyone either living\nor dead.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198825 "

Imperial\nCollege Union's Dramatic Society,\nunder the name Theatre West End, is\nrunning a Fringe venue on Princes\nProms\nAugust and September are Proms\nmonths. You are best advised to get\nan official programme from any good\nnew agent and carefully plan your\nSummer around your favourite\nconcerts. The tickets are dirt cheap\nif you're prepared to squat in the\narena of the Royal Albert Hall and\nqueue for a few hours beforehand.\nIf you go to several concerts in the\nseason you can qualify for a ticket to\nthe Last Night. It's all good fun if you\nlike that jingoistic stuff.\nUS1C\nMusic venues are enjoying something\nof a renaissance at the moment. Bands\ndon't usually play during August and\nSeptember but this year there is some\nreal talent doing the circuit.\nThe Men They Couldn't Hang are\nplaying the Mean Fiddler on July 5th.I 've been told that they're an excellent\nlive band, but if you're going you\nmust wear steel-toe capped shoes!\nAlso at the Mean Fiddler but from\n13th15 th July, Mary Coughlan is\nshowcasing her latest album. You can\nfind out more details about both these\ngigs from the venue on 01-961 5490.\n10,000 Maniacs are visiting the\nTown and Country Club on August\n1st. They're charging \u00a3 6 . 5 0 per\nticket, whereas Ozzy Osbourne, also\nat the T&C Club on July 13th14 th, is asking \u00a3 8 . 5 0 .\nStreet for the whole period. The\nactual Fringe Festival has become so\ncommercialised over the last few\nyears that there have been calls for a 'Fringe-Fringe' Festival.\nTheatre West End usually has some\nreally good (as well as some really\nna ff) plays and revues on over the\nthree weeks of the Fringe. DramSoc\nwill be performing three plays this\nyear. If you can only spare a long\nweekend, the best time is between\nWeeks Two and Three so you can\ntake in all the IC shows.\nEdinburgh gets incredibly crowded\nfor these three weeks, so don't bother\ngoing on the spur of the moment\nbecause you'll never find any\naccommodation once you get up\nthere.\nIf you are chained to Imperial\nduring August, you will probably get\nthe opportunity to see at least one of\nthe three Edinburgh plays performed\nsometime at the beginning of the\nAutumn Term.\nCabaret\nCabaret can be found throughout\nLondon. The best place is the\nComedy Store on the Leicester\nSquare where they're currently\nfeaturing some act called Felix! Local\nvenues include the Duke Of Clarence\nat 203 Holland Park Avenue and the\nKensington Tavern at 54 Russell\nSquare Gardens. Quality cabaret acts\ncan be found most nights.\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd198867 "

At the same time the\nGovernment is attacking the students'\npocket directly, in the form of\nreduced benefits and grants in real\nterms. All of this creates an\nunfavourable environment for the\nachievement of high academic\nstandards and this creates a greater\nneed for welfare support.\n\u2022 These services need to be in place\nas soon as possible.\n\u2022The staff for these services must\nbe remunerated at the prevailing\nrate, rather than any form of 'half\nmeasure' level that does not get the\nbest and most appropriately\nqualified people.\n\u2022 Hopefully, this expertise will be\nbased in the Union as a sanctuary\nfrom some of the possible causes of\nthe stresses mentioned above.\nThis whole issue is one of the\nreasons why the Student Union as an\nemployer and carer must generate\nfunds from trading activities etc.\nHopefully I 've shown you my\njustification for 'On Campus'\ncommerce.

It's not surprising\u2014only\nabout one half of the Union hacks at\nMonday's Union Council knew. The\nPresident. Sydney Harbour Bridge\n(ne Howgate) didn't think it of\nsufficient importance to mention it?\nHe claims to have brought it up at the\nprevious meeting verbally. But I don't remember it. It's not in the minutes.\nWhen it was brought up. Mr\nHarbour Bridge claimed that it was\nonly a 'personal' paper, and didn't represent the views of anyone but\nhimself.\nIt appears that any student can\npresent a paper to the Governing\nBody.\nIt really is the limit to suggest that\nsuch a major change without\ndiscussing it with anybody\u2014how can\nhe expect College to support things\nwhen even the students might be\nagainst it. Of course, if you are\nreaching the end of year in office, you\nhave a particular bee in your bonnet\nand don't want to be bothered with\nwhat democracy exists in the Union\n(and you sit on an important College\ncommittee), you can put a proposal\nin a 'personal' capacity.\nFinally, a suggestion: if you don't agree with having no time at\nlunchtime to hold College-wide club\nmeetings and don't agree that major\n\u2022changes should be put to College\nbefore the students hear about it,\nperhaps you could put a paper to\nGoverning Body too!\nFELIX Wednesday June 22nd19887 "
