Glands centred around our armpits, ears, eyelids, genitals, and lips\nconstantly emit fragrant and alluring chemical messengers known as pheromones.\nBut do we know how to interpret the messages?\nAlthough BO is preferable to many of the Superdrug alternatives, the evidence\nsuggests that we hate our natural smell. Anyone who has ever been left choking by a too-liberal handful of Lynx will know that there never was a greater misnomer than\n\"deodorant\".\nBut natural pheromones are widely used by other species to attract mating partners. Fish,\nspiders, pigs, tortoises and even millipedes make full use of their aromatic firepower - as well as\ntheir numerous other charms - to get their other half in the mood.\nWhy shouldn't we use the same cunning plan? Mysteriously enough, we mimic these lowly\nlifeforms rather more closely than we might have liked to think.\nAfter scrubbing our natural odour s away, we replace them with perfumes and deodorants that\noften contain natural or synthetic animal pheromones. What's more, the favoured pheromones are\nusually those that would have served as nostril tickling ti till at or s to their original owners.\nMusk, for example, has been used in both male and female perfumes for over 3000 years.\nAlthough musk-like chemicals can now be synthesised, musk took its name from the musk deer\nfrom whose intimate glands it was originally extracted.\nAll of which gives me a very original idea for a perfume advertisement...\nM Credits Coe\ned: Ouiam and Hilary Lips: Catfish\nBy the time you're 25, you'll have seen 10,000 murders on screen. This may be\nnothing compared to the number of kisses you've seen, but that probably\ndepends whether the last film you saw was\nFour Weddings and a Funeral or\nReservoir Dogs.\nKissing first hit the\ncinema screen in Queen\nVictoria's reign, when\neven the slightest show\nof physical affection\nprovoked outrage. In\ncomparison, modern\nmedia leave very\nlittle to the\nimagination, but\nthat didn't prevent\nhuge interest when\nRoseanne and\nSandra Bernhardt\ns nog ged on\nprimetime TV. Kissing is a human activity\ncharged with meaning.\nThe lips are richly\nsupplied with nerve\nendings feeding straight\ninto the largest area of the\nsensory cortex, and it is this fact\nthat accounts for kissing's continuing popularity.\nThere's extra good news for slimmer s as well, because according to Focus Magazine, \"a really steamy s noggin g session can burn off up to 150 calories\". This, apparently, is the\nequivalent of doing the front crawl for 15 minutes.\nOr is that a euphemism?\n4\nlil f FELIX I0FEB3S\n\n"

    "content": "News\nKings Caught\nBY ANDREW SMITH Kings College students were\ninvolved in a reckless attack on\nImperial College Union's( ICU)\nTraditional Bar last Saturday.\nSpeculation continues that the\nraid was officially planned by\nmembers of the Kings College\nStudents' Union.\nIn what has been described\nas a 'misguided mascot ry retaliation', fourteen Kings students arrived in a minibus and\nentered the Traditional Bar via\nDa Vinci's, removing bottles of\nalcohol and a number of\ntankards. On finding the exit of\nthe Traditional Bar locked, the\nattackers then broke the old oak\ndoors in an attempt to make their\nescape.\nThe cost of the raid, which\nmay eventually total as much as\n\u00a32000, was incurred largely as a result of damage inflicted on the\nancient doors. Several historical\ncollege tankards also need repair\nor replacement. Off-duty bar\nstewards and former IC students\nmanaged to apprehend four of\nthe King's students; limiting further destruction and\nproviding initial information\nabout the incident.\nWhilst a number of the\nstudents involved in the attack\nwere in their first year at Kings,\nit has been confirmed that the\nchairman of Kings' Student\nRepresentative Council (SRC)\nwas one of the raiders. However,\nthe Kings Students' Union President, Ghassan Karian, is\nnow keen to describe mascot ry as\n'toss' despite displaying an\ninterest in the activity earlier this\nyear.\nGhassan, who following the\nwithdrawal of Lucy Chothia is\nthe leading candidate for\nUniversity of London President,\nblamed IC for the attack.\nSpeaking to FELIX he claimed\nthat it was 'Imperial's fault', but\nlater suggested that it was\nindirectly the fault of the Royal\nCollege of Science Union( RCSU). According to Mr Karian\nthe event has its origin in the\nRCSU's taking of Kings' mascot,\na stone lion called Reggie, last\nyear.\nHe insisted that his Union\nwas not involved, nor had they\nprior knowledge of the event. He\nalso denied allegations that a Kings' minibus was used.\nFollowing the incident, which\nmay damage his image in the\nPresidential race, the Kings' Sabbatical is now distancing\nhimself from mascot ry in general.\nThe ICU Executive Committee, meeting this Monday,\nwill decide whether to press\ncharges immediately, or whether\nto delay a final decision. Lucy\nChothia, ICU President, has\nmade clear her preference that\nthe people who organised the\nattack should take responsibility\nrather than, 'a few naive 1st years'. The possibility of pressing\ncharges is available because a security camera, erected after\nprevious violent incidents, the\nminibus used in the raid and the\noffending students as they\nentered Beit Quad.\nNUS Court Imperial Students\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAM Imperial College Union( ICU)\nmay have moved a step closer to\naffiliation of the National Union\nof Students ( NUS) this week.\nRepresentatives of the NUS spent\nthe week talking to members of\nICU Council in an attempt to\npersuade it of the benefits of\njoining the national union.\nSo far the NUS has offered\nan annual affiliation fee of\n\u00a320,000, reduced from \u00a340,000, to\ntry to attract ICU. They have also\nguaranteed a saving of at least\n\u00a311,000 on beer from the bulk\nbuying group that the NUS operates, whilst further savings\non shop items and spirits have\nyet to be worked out. However, it\nis unclear how this will benefit\nthose students using the Union\nbars as the price of beer served\nwould not change. The \u00a39000\nshortfall from the affiliation fee\nwould also have to be found from\nsomewhere. Union sources\nsuggest that clubs and societies'\nfunding would be hit.\nIn justifying the extra \u00a39000,\nthe NUS have been keen to stress\nthat it offers more than savings\non alcohol. Speaking to FELIX, Steve Hay, NUS Treasurer said:\n\"We offer a wide range of\nservices, not just NUS services\nLtd.[ The company NUS operates with bulk buying\npowers]\". They were also keen to\nstress their political credentials\nand achievements in influencing\ngovernment policy, though the\nNUS would continue to fight for\nstudent rights whether or not\nImperial was a member. Other\nadvantages of membership, say\nthe NUS, would be free legal\nadvice, available to the Union as\nwell as individual NUS members.\nAlthough they would not pay for\nall court cases, \"we support test\ncases that will improve the well\nbeing of students,\" said Sharon\nHunter, Regional Worker for\nLondon.\nIf Imperial were to join the\nNUS it would have about six\nelected delegates to send to the\nNational Conference, the NUS' decision making body. At present\nthere are a total of 900 delegates.\nCritics of any affiliation\nplans see this as proof that\nImperial would not have a particularly loud voice within the\nnational body. There is also a certain amount of suspicion\namongst students concerning the\nNUS' eagerness for Imperial to\njoin. It has been suggested that it\nwould be 'a feather in their cap'\nwere ICU to say yes.\nAt present the process is still\nat a consultation stage but it is\nnow clear that a referendum of IC\nstudents is very likely in the near\nfuture.\nMM FELIX I0FGB95\n\n"

    "content": "Standby\nbeating around the bulge\nFew who read the music press even\noccasionally could have failed to\nnotice the attention given to belly\nand particularly to Tanya Donelly\nabout a year ago. Since then Oasis\nhave become the new darlings of\nthe Indie Scene, but Belly are back\nwith their new album king.\nThere are fewer instantly\ngrasp able 'poppy' tunes then I expected, but this is basically a good thing from the point of view\nof continued listening. The\ntrademark drum emphasising indie\nrhythm has been toned down too.\nHowever, the main thing you notice\nis the change in Ms Donelly's vocal\nstyle. The bite is still there, but she\nstays much closer to the melody,\nand more often or not in key! The\nband also plays more tightly than\nbefore, though this is only to be\nexpected as familiarity grows.\nThese changes make this album\nquite a progression, and while\nsome will dislike them, it makes it\neasier to concentrate on and\nappreciate the very real talent this\nband have.\nMy only real criticism is that\noccasionally you feel that too much\nattention has been paid to detail\nand that some of the edge has\ngone. However listening through to\nthe brilliant final track 'Judas My\nHeart', this little niggle is easily\nforgotten as you realise just how\ngood Belly are at writing quality\nsongs, which owe more to folk than\nindie. (9)\nThe senseless things' fourth\nlong-player, taking care of business,\nshows the Things honing their\nsound to paradoxically incorporate\nmore of their favourite bands whilst\nsounding even more like\nthemselves. The likes of 'Christine\nKeeler' and 'Role Models' are the\nperfect examples, melodic pastiches\nwhich plunder from the treasure-chests of the New York Dolls, Soul\nAsylum and, of course, the\nReplacements, but which rock in a big, bold, and completely non-brassy kind of way.\nElsewhere, 'Dead Sun' shows\nthat they still know how to play\npunk, but then that was always a natural and organic part of their\nsound, not some new-style fad that\nthey picked up on just after the\ngutter music press did. Meanwhile,\n'16-18-21' and 'Page 3 Valentine'\nopen up even more avenues,\nmarrying rhythmic movements to\nscything guitar riffs with Mark Keds'\nfamiliar rasp articulating his\npolemic thoughts on religion, love,\nicons, and all things relevant over\nthe top. No apologies are made for\nusing that well-worn clich e: every\nFELIX track's a winner.\nWith a songwriting prowess\nlike Mark's it's small wonder that\nhe's currently being courted by\nlesser bands who have taken from\nthe Senseless Things in over-liberal\nquantities and had greater success.\nIgnore the NME, ignore your\nprejudices, and hey, ignore my\nsuperlatives, but make sure you buy\nthis album. (9)\nOver the last year victoria\nWilliams has got more attention\nfrom the fact that she's 'got' MS\nthan the fact that she's a musician.\nBut her Dingwall's gig last week\nshowed where sweet relief ended\nand the real woman begins.\nWhereas on record she can\nsometimes come across as some\nlost remnant from a California hippy\nconvent, live it quickly becomes\nclear that she's simply enjoying\nherself. Towards the end, the\nevening developed into a request\nshow. Some artists might have\nthought this demanding but Victoria\njust smiled and said, \"oh yeah\nthat's a good one\" and did it.\nUnsurprisingly she had to come\nback for two encores.\nStill before that point domestic\nbliss was ensured as Victoria's husband, Mark Olsen from the\nJayhawks, turned up - apparently it\nwas the first time they'd seen each\nother in months due to their touring\nschedules. Which is nice way to\nsum the lady up. She wasn't sure\nhe was there so had to ask, \"Mark\nare you here?\". \"Yes\", he said and\nthey sang a couple of songs\ntogether. Anyone else and it would\nhave sickening (and totally false).\nIn light of all the shenanigans\nyour intrepid music reviewer had to\nendure to get into dream theater's gig in Ronnie Scott's, it\nwas a good job it was worth the\neffort. A one-off affair in relaxed\nand intimate surroundings, this was\napparently designed to allow the\nband to play a number of their\nfavourite cover versions with an\neven greater number of special\nguests. And so we were treated to a whole spectrum of influences -from U2's 'Red Hill Mining Town' to\nMarillion's 'Easter' (with Steve\nHogarth and Steve Rothery) right\nthrough to Metallica's 'Damage\nInc.' (with Napalm Death's Barney\non guest vocals). In between there\nwere healthy Rush and Yes\nworkouts and an amazing musical\njam featuring Yes' Steve Howe. All\nin all the band did absolutely no\nharm to their burgeoning\nreputation as the most accomplished group of musicians in the\nworld. 0\nbelly\nfi mci rif Mf ln an s*% ty ao/ UMAA/ OWV Valentine* sf ze ci at, FELIX, br v as&aci aUx m/ with/c$ c>ee U u a x/, bs/ amino/ aw mj/5 pains*\nay b bok/e/ bs/ v& v bh>e/p btn v^ ke/S'( v aw/ S/h/ ank/\ncR& cbe/m/p> b bo/n/,s/ bav vb nu/ Tjww/\ncK< Pu/v/ bn/S/ and/\nc YYlxyiaan ^team an/ \u00a7M/ this/ Sunday m tw n in a(iZ tA^e&j.^%o/ UMAV bh&se/ tic Jie bs/ alt u o wha A ie/ to/do/ bs> UP\noo/tt ve/ bo/ bt ve> FELIX a^/p boe/ today/, up bb tv a ow pa/itn&i/,s hom in u/ scans' opa^ect io j v wiM$v him/, ke/v<yv bb. <\n~^>e/au i&h/ as/ thoA j/ ux it i/ scum du>/ a on c/!

    "content": "Valentine's Day Historical Accident Leaves Legacy of Pain BY JEREMY THOMSON, OUR ROMANCE CORRESPONDENT Here's a problem - you have half a page in a large circulation student newspaper, a theme\nof Valentine's Day and two days. What would\nyou do? How about paying a visit to the new\nInfinite Monkey House at London Zoo with a contract from IBM word processors (got to\nkeep up with the times) and see what you\ncome up with? Or maybe you would stumble\nthrough with the usual disjointed musings\nand 'just be yourself Hollywood morals. Or\npossibly you could opt for the freshly\ntarnished camera tapping deconstruction of\nthe medium angle, as I obviously have.\nAccident\nThe first thing must surely to do a little\nbackground research. The facts must be\nknown before they can be hidden and\ndistorted again. Unfortunately the only fact\navailable on the good St Valentine heralded by\nthe dusty reference section of FELIX TOWERS was that his association with\npassion laden anonymous outpourings was a 'historical accident'. A historical accident?\nDid the mighty scholars of yesteryear falter in\ntheir relentless crusade for the truth? Did some sinner want to plant a proverbial\nskeleton in Valentine's cupboard? Possible St\nValentine was, well, a bit randy and got\ncaught.\nIn Bed Staring\nWhatever the truth may be, he has left a legacy. No other occasion has such a wide\npart ici pan ce in an activity of pure and\nbeautiful motive - simply to finally inform\nthose who have been making your life a complex, inexplicable, delicious misery what\nyou really feel because you were always too\nfrightened. Anonymously. You send them a card or a letter with your most personal,\nvulnerable ranting s to finally resolve the\nproblem, but you don't sign it hoping that\nsomehow they will know. You wish that your\nfeelings could transmit on the sub ether and\nthat when you next spy them and catch their\neyes for that extra few milliseconds before\nturning back to your rugby songs or noisy\ncelibate friend that you will have reached a new landmark in your relationship.\nYet in the back of your mind, as you lie\nin bed staring at the pink sky, you know that\nsome suave confident type has whisked up\nyour special person with no regard for their\nfeelings only to leave them so much poorer\nand about as tall as whale droppings a few\nweeks later. If only you had told them - you\nwould never hurt them, you know how to\nreally look after them. Unless you are that\nsuave confident individual, in which case you\nare probably the cause of more confused\ninternal brooding than, e rrr... metaphors fail\nme. Git.\nWe C rave\nSo why then do we indulge in an almost\npseudo-religious ritual of twanging the heart\nstrings? There is a theory that events like this\nevolve because actual religion is on the\ndecline, but it's not a very interesting one.\nCould it be that it is the very uncertainty and\ndoubt that we crave, the continual internal\nstruggle, would he, wouldn't he, placing the\nvery dearest motives of your life in the hands\nof luck? No, I don't think so. We are simply\nhorridly timid and terrible at controlling the\nreally important things in our lives. However\nbrash, busy, enthusiastic and expert someone\ncan get over football, physics or similar utterly\ntrivial pastimes, when it comes to jobs,\npartners, friends, and to a lesser extent money,\nwe blindly blunder into every obstacle in our\npath, choosing instead to focus our planning\nand thought to things of no real consequence\nwhatsoever.\nMaybe this is why politicians are so\nfrighteningly incompetent...\nlm Wed at %%\ni.

That means we\nare starting the classes at 5.30pm and finishing them at 7.30pm. The venue is still Civil\nEng Building, Room 101 and the classes are\nstill on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.\nThe style of our classes has also changed\n(so no more white bottles!). This term we are\nfollowing a timetable (check notice board no.\n49 on Sherfield Walkway) and for the first\npart of each session, the tutor will cover on or\nmore of the following: shading, perspective,\nfigure drawing, colours, etc. The remainder\nof the lesson can be devoted to either continuing to experiment on that day's topic or\nworking on an individual piece (maybe even\nfor the Staff Student Exhibition in May this\nyear). The purpose of this individual work is\nfor the teachers to help you learn more of the\nvarious techniques as you work on them. The\nteachers are there to help you so please ask\nthem if you have any questions.\nThe cost of the lesson is a mere \u00a32 and\nmaterial is provided but you are welcome to\nbring your own if you like. Membership is \u00a33\nfor students, and \u00a36 for staff. For those of you\nwho received our newsletter, please do return\nour survey.\nFor more information, please email\nleonardo@ic, or leave a note in our pigeonhole in the Union Office (SCAB HZ). Dance Club's Trip to Sheffield\nKeys: Cha-cha-cha, Jive, Win\nBy 8.15am, Saturday 4th February, most of\nthe 46 members if the IC Dance Club Team,\nalong with a few supporters, were gathered in\nBeit Quad. It was the morning of the\nSheffield Social, the first of the 3 annual student dancing competitions, and we had six\nyears of titles to defend. The four hour trip\nup to the octagon centre passed to the overwhelming smell of hairspray, the application\nof obscene quantities of makeup, and last\nminute repairs to costumes. Once we'd arrived and had found our tables, the rituals\nof getting dressed began, whilst Christine\nbegan the task of doing the hair of the modern team. The floor wasn't overly fast (slip-per y) but was very solid, making it hard work\nfor the quickstep and jive couples.\nAt 2.30pm the competitions started with\nthe open section. Here we had a great deal of\nsuccess, winning or reaching the finals of\nnearly all of the student competitions. Next\nwas the team walk on, where we should have\nbeen called the Imperial Army, with nearly\ndouble the number of competitors of any\nother university there. Battle commenced\nwith the team match, followed by rising\nexcitement, and finally the knock-out.\nThe result? We lived up to our reputation and swept the board winning the knock-out, and the A,B and C team competitions,\nmainly by a consistently high performance by\neveryone, especially Ivan and Sarah 2nd with\nJeremy and Lorna 4th( waltz), Satin and\nMansi 3rd with Nick and Barbara 5th( cha-cha-cha), Bryan and Annya 1st with Jo and\nJacqui 5th( quickstep), Peter and Karen 1st, David and Liz4 th and Nevil and Ruth 5th( Jive).\nBy 12.45 we were all back on the coach,\nwhere the celebrations continued for about\n1/2 an hour until everyone fell asleep, or discussed tactics for SUDA in 3 weeks or IV DA in 4.\nCongratulations to all the team, and\nthanks to everyone who helped to get us\nthere, especially Christine for the hair, and\nVicky and Dorothy who coached us up to a winning standard.\nP3QLTD\nFilms This Week\nKeys: Exorcist, Browning, Fiction\nNo, hold on a minute there is absolutely no\nneed to worry. Yes that's right Pulp Fiction\nis still showing at ICU Cinema. Okay, so you\nmay have missed the last two nights but there\nare still three performances of this ultra-brilliant film remaining. The shows tonight are\nat 8pm and 11pm, so it is possible to have a fun evening with your friends and then welcome in the wee small hours. Saturday sees\nour last show of Pulp Fiction at 8pm but the\nnight is not over once the credits for this film\nhave run.\nOh no, don't even think about missing\nthe monster movie, that is the Saturday Late\nShow. While people think they are being\nscared by Interview With A Vampire, we give\nyou the chance to see the film that set the\nstandards of all horror films made since, The\nExorcist. The Browning Version is at 8pm on Sunday, included amongst its cast is Greta\nScacchi who you may have seen in Presumed\nInnocent last Saturday Night. If she's lucky\nthough she may not die in this film, which\nfeatures a teacher at crisis point, must have\nbeen the one of those that used to teach me.\nThat's Entertainment\nKeys: Cupid, Regurgitate, Love\nValentines week and I 've got my sack for\nall the cards I'm going to get (er, did I hear\nthe word 'not'?). To mark the romance in the\nair, ICU Ents have gone a bit hearts, flowers\nand Cupids, so get sexy for the week ahead.\nMonday - Live Football\nNothing very romantic about... Big Screen\nLive Football. Da Vinci's,7pm. Tuesday - Pub Quiz\nDan gets even more sexy than usual (yes, it is\npossible!) with a night of questions with a leaning towards love and sex. \u00a350 cash prize\nfor the winning team, courtesy of ST A Travel.

Wednesday - Club Spanque\nDrinking, dancing and tapping off (a quaint\nnorthern term), at Club Spanque. 9pm lam,\nUnion and free.\nThursday - Lovey-do vey Cocktails\nA special love y do vey cocktail night. Where\nelse can you experience Valentines Kiss and\nSex on the Beach without leaving the Quad.\nIf we get enough response, a very special one-off Blind Date. (We still need 10 gorgeous\npouting students, 5 of each sex, to take part.\nContact the Union Office!). Da Vinci's, free.\nFriday - Comedy, Disco\nA full night of passion, mystery and intrigue!\nStarting early with Bust-a Gut Comedy, featuring Chris and George (an anarchic combination of quick witted banter and blazing\nsilliness), Julian Barrett and Phil Davey.\nThere's free Newcastle Brown Ale to the first\nfifty in the door, and it's just \u00a32.50 (or \u00a31.50 if\nyou've got an Ents Card!).\nThen, get sexy and get funky with\n'Love', a night of unadulterated adult plea-sure s, with romantic things on the door, and\na very special love lounge chill-out zone - and\nit's still \u00a31. So go out and find the one you\nlove!\nAnd don't forget - next Friday, 24th, is\nan evening of explicit bad taste, starting with\nthe regurgitating skills of Stevie Starr, then\ngoing off on a high-tack groove of 70's and\n80's pleasures for the disco. So get in the\nmood, raid those Oxfam shops and get seriously aesthetically challenged.\nArticles for Xtra Curricular\nIf you would like an article to be\nincluded in the Xtra Curricular section,\nplease bring it along to the FELIX Office.\nThe article must be submitted on the\nFriday before the issue is due to come out,\nand preferably on disk.

    "content": "Volleyball E ICvs West Sussex\nA six man squad left Imperial an\nTuesday to play West Sussex\nUniversity in the second round\nplayoffs of the BUSA tournament.\nIt was evident from our\nperformance in the first set that\nwe had been subjected to non-stop\ntalk Radio Shervin Badamchi for\nthe 2 hour journey.\nWest Sussex had to do little to\ntake the set from us. Slowly\ngetting accustomed to the low\nceiling, a hostile crowd of 20 girls\nand the sight of the coach of the\nnext round's opposition sitting in\nthe audience furiously taking\nnotes, we played as if in a daze.\nThe next set was also finished\nin record time, despite judicious\nuse of Time Outs by captain\nRobert Stravens. Again we didn't put up a fight, slipping under easy\nattacks. We entered the third set\n2-0 down, knowing that we were\ncapable of beating this opposition.\nBut we had lost the confidence\nneeded to finish our carefully\nchoreographed at tacks. Still in\nshock from the first 2 sets, we lost\nthe third and the game with it.\nSome good play by Ed Duffus\nonly delayed the end. \"Our 4 best\nplayers couldn't come,\" we\nexplained to them. Thick random\npoly we said to each other on the\nway back when Shervin paused\nfor breath. The other players were\nSebastien fau zan, Piotr Stanczyk\nand Manfred Kracs.\nOrienteering \u00a9\nLast Sunday's event was at\nBurnham Beeches, near Slough.\nWe had very late start, so\neveryone got a lie-in, to such an\nextent that some people missed\nthe bus.\nWilliam and Matt staggered\naround the 13km, M21 long\ncourse in respectable times of\nlOOm in s, only to find it had been\nwon in 65mins. Carol staggered\naround the 9.3 km, W2IL course\nand got a gold standard. Hans\nstormed round the M21 short\ncourse but failed to get a gold\nstandard, while Shao Wei also\nhad a successful run. Henza and\nJenny had fun on the Orange.\nThe day's highlights: muddy\npuddles. The day'slow lights: we\ndidn't finish in time for the pub.\nBadminton IC men II vs Reading0\nThe first pair H.S. Ooi and D. Hart played well winning all\nthree games, despite a slow start.\nJ. Kwok and H. Huay, the second\npair, did their part, winning only\none game because R. Huray\nretired hurt in the last game. The\nexperienced third pair, C. Lim( captain) and A. Saw played in\ntheir usual manner, only losing\nagainst the opposing first pair.\nIC Ladies LsfvsU.E.A.0 An excellent result for the ladies\nteam, taking us to the third round\nof the BUSA tournament. Well\ndone to Wendy, Danielle, Kate,\nClaire, Elaine and Barbara.\nFootball IC Ladies vs K CH0 Having waited an extra half an\nhour at Victoria, we discovered\nwe were one player short.\nLndaunted, we made our way\nthrough the wilderness of southwest London to the K CH ground.\nWith a little extra effort from\neveryone, we were all over the\nopposition. Despite the chances\navailable, nobody could finish\nanything off in the first half.\nStar guests Paula (centre\nback) and Juliette (right forward),\nwho scored the second scorcher,\ndid well-as well as Linda, the\nQPR keeper we borrowed!\nWoman of the match, Paula\nBates, opened our scoring in the\nsecond half with a great shot,\nripping apart KCH's defence.\nOur usual keeper, Thurka,\ndidn't let anyone past her on the\nright, matching Emily's( left\nback) performance. Eleanor in a new position, right mid-field, and\nHelen in left-mid performed\nsuperbly. Ioanna was a great help\nfor Maryam, covering the centre\nof the pitch.\nPaula B. said \"the best chance\nthey [KCH] had was the clearance\nMaryam made\". The a fore mentioned also scared the keeper,\nwho did not know what her teammate was up to when she\nconceded that corner.\nThanks to all those who\nturned up. Well done!

    "content": "Cat's Tale\nAValentine's Day Tale by Samin Ishtiaq\nIt was a couple of days before\nValentine's, and Nils, Paul and I were\nsitting in some god-forsaken pub in\nSouth Wimbledon. I blame Nils\nentirely for ending up here. Fulham is\nfine by me. Its pubs may be yuppy ish( can I say that word in the caring,\nsharing 90s?) but it does have places\nlike the Slug, where women in tight\nwhite jeans make eyes at you.\nAnyway, we were in this pub and\ntalking lads' talk. This usually involves\nfootball, beer, and remember en ces of\ndrunken exploits in faraway places. At\nthis time of the year it also involves\nwomen. But it's depressing to talk\nabout Nils' women: his prospects are\nHe armed himself with gadgets to pick\nlocks, gloves to disguise his fingerprints,\ndark clothes to blend in with the bleak\nacademic surroundings, and an accurate\nunderwater stop watch to time himself.\nalways dark. (To be a Norwegian\nsounds unfortunate; to be an Imperial\ngraduate on top of that begins to\nsound like carelessness.) \"So, are you\ngoing to hire a black limo for Zoe,\nSamin?\" Paul asked, referring to a mutual friend who often had more\nmoney than sense (and he didn't have that much money either). Some\nsniggers and then I countered with\n\"But do you think Ann will get a card\nfrom Akshat this year?\". The incident\nthis referred to caused so much mirth\namongst us that we nearly spilt our\npints. In lads' land this counts as\nsacrilege, so I was promptly dispatched to refill the pork scratching s supply.\nThe Akshat incident happened last\nyear, just around this time. Akshat\nwas a colleague of ours and shared a Management course run by Ann\n(surnames, I think, will have to be\nexcluded from this recollection).\nAkshat wasn'ta friend. In fact, I don't think he could ever be anyone's friend. He was like one of those pet\ndogs you have when you're a kid: the\nmore you kick it the more it comes\nback. In disgust at its lack of self-esteem you would try to ignore it, but\nthe bully in you wouldn't let you do\nthat.\nBesides these characteristics,\nAkshat was also a test-bed for Nils'\nTheory of Bullying. This ran as\nfollows: if someone is weak then you\nshould bully him, as this prepares him\nfor the real world. In the spirit of true\nInductivism, Nils had tried to establish\nhis theory by bullying his younger\nbrother - until he became bigger\nthan Nils. As Akshat had reached the\nstage where he wouldn't grow any\nmore, we all thought\nthat we were safe\nfrom this 'Mr Atlas'\neffect that would\narise in experiments.\nAs soon as\nAnn's management\ncourse started we\nstarted to tease\nAkshat about Ann,\nsaying that he had a thing about her. Of\ncourse, he didn't. In\nfact, it really was\nonly possible to\nfancy Ann after half a dozen pints of\nSanta Claus. Late in January Paul\ncame up with a new tease. He said to\nAkshat that he would send a Valentine's card to Ann signed with\nAkshat's name. It was no surprise that\nAkshat took this threat very seriously,\nas Paul had upset a mutual friend by\nactually performing this action a couple of years back.\nI suppose we could claim a first\nin Nils' Theory. Akshat was pushed,\nand proceeded to take a course of\naction that was devious and\nunderhand. We had created a monster: Akshat was like the\nchartered accountant in Sha//ow\nGrave. Akshat's plan was to break\ninto Ann's office on the eve of\nValentine's Day and steal the card.\nHe armed himself with gadgets to\npick locks, gloves to disguise his\nfingerprints, dark clothes to blend in\nwith the bleak academic surroundings, and an accurate underwater stop watch to time himself.\nPaul didn't actually do anything\nabout the card. (This wasn't the first\ntime: his plans for dieting and\nexercise lie equally incomplete). But\nAkshat, reading more into our\ngestures than was there, undertook\nhis plan. On February the 13th,1994, at precisely 23.15, with a prayer to all the gods that he could\nthink of, Akshat broke into Ann's office. And at precisely 23.17, the\nnew, lean n' mean, privatised security\nservice caught their first intruder of\nthe year. (They had to be sharp, you\nsee, as performance indicators for\nthis year determined their budget\nnext year. Who says Thatcherism\ndoesn't work?)\nEvents took a swift and rather\ncruel turn after that. I don't know the\ndetails, but Akshat apparently dug his\nown grave. He piled in a couple of\nlies that contradicted each other\nwhen led to their logical conclusion.\nFor the sake of decency we three\ntried to intervene, but it was really all\nover by then. In a way Akshat got\naway lightly. He was allowed to stay\non 'till the end of the year and take\nhis exams. But his chances of getting\na good reference were lost.\nAkshat had originally wanted to\ngo to some college in Massachusetts\n- I forget the name. After the incident\nhe kept up the pretence that he was\ndoing GREs and whatever else it is\nthat Americans do to get into\n'graduate school'. He said to\neveryone that there was no problem\ngetting into this college; that all they\nwanted was a2:2. Most of our class\njust went \"yeah, yeah\" and passed\nby. The end of the year came and\nAkshat disappeared. We never did\nexpect to get any e mail from\n'aks hat@ mass.edu', so were not\nsurprised when nothing appeared.\nAnn still teaches the management course. Apparently, she wasn't even aware of the whole story, just\nthat somebody had tried to break into\nher office.\nThere's a moral to this whole tale, but\nI don't know what it is. I originally\nthought the story was the funny side\nto Valentine's Day. But maybe it isn't that funny. (\"Comedy + Time =\nTragedy\" wrote Woody Allen, for\nManhattan I think.) Useful idiots\nabound (Akshat, Richard Gott) and\nit's fun to play tricks on them. But\nwhen it comes to the end...\nI0PCB9B FELIX EM\n\n"

Mr. Hunt was\nwarmly greeted by those present\nand the comments in the questions\nround were all intelligent and\nconstructive. It is certainly true that\nmany of our members are\nconcerned about the future of our\ndemocracy in a federal Europe, but\nI make no apologies for that.\nLabour in contrast are prisoners of\nthe trade unions (that's Clause II,\nMr. Blair) who see the expansion of\nthe European Commission as an\nexpedient albeit undemocratic way\nof achieving the reversal of the\nemployment law reforms of the last\nsixteen years.\nThe Chancellor has himself\nacknowledged the unpopularity of\nthe recent but necessary tax\nincreases so it is misinformed to\nreport David Hunt's echo of that as\na \"veiled attack\" on his colleague.\nNor did he once mention that tax\ncuts might be necessary to win the\nnext election.

In a society whose\nlack of accountable political\ninstitutions allows the political\ntrend of the day to steamroller\nsociety into meekly accepting the\nimplementation of whatever\nideology serves their particular\ninterest group best (the erosion of\nthe fund a ment s of our social\nstructure and the rights of the\nindividual, and the descent of the\neconomy into an investment-starved grapple for short-term\nprofit during the last decade is,\ndepressingly, proof enough).

People often live in a mild\nstate of tension and fear; hoping\nthat for the first time in years they\nwill receive a small token of love\nfrom a secret admirer. If, like me,\nyou have prepared yourself for\nanother barren day, then you may\nbe able to seek some comfort from\nAugust Sfrindberg's play, the\ndance of death, running at the\nAlmeida Theatre.\nThe play, written in 1 900, is a deeply pessimistic insight into\nmarriage at a time when there\nwas generally no 'get out clause'.\nIt centres around an aging couple\nliving on a small island off the\nSwedish coast who are nearing\ntheir silver wedding anniversary.\nJohn Neville (who played the\nBaron in 'the Adventures of Baron\nMunchausen') is the arrogant\nCaptain and Alice [Gemma Jones)\nis his emotionally tortured wife.\nTogether they seem to have\nreached the conclusion that they\nwere destined to bring each other\nmisery.\nA recurrent theme throughout\nthe production is that both Alice\nand the Captain are constantly\nbelittling the other and blaming\nthem for a marital life of suffering.\nWhen Kurt (Anthony O 'Donnell),\nan old friend, arrives on the island\nit appears as though a cease-fire\ncould be reached. However, the\nmanipulative couple only succeed\nin corrupting the arbitrator and\ncreating even more pain.\nSuch is the bitterness of\nStrindberg's characters that one is\nnot sure if the play is a tragedy or\na comedy. Indeed, at times the\nproduction is quietly amusing and\nthe audience is even encouraged\nto laugh. Strindberg was of the\nopinion that men and women are\nbonded by sex, not love, and that\nit was normal to dislike, even\ndespise one's partner.\nThere is, however, a more\nhumane and sensitive side to the\ncharacters. This allows a sympathetic tolerance to prevail\nand it is here that the actors come\ninto their own. John Neville, in\nparticular, gives a brilliantly\ncontrolled performance of a clearly unstable man.\nMaybe, because I'm a romantic or just somewhat naive, I find Strindberg's portrayal of\nmarriage hard to swallow and I disagree that it has to be so\nmiserable. If, however, I fail to\nreceive any valentine's cards this\nyear I may reassess my view. 0\nO How is it that when The Nerd has\nfinally become fashionable, IC still\nmanages to remove 'The' and\nrelegate the ' N' to lower case ?\nFace it, 95 is the chance to make\nthe place famous.

    "content": "Opinion\nuse Private Lee Clegg, member of\nthe Parachute Regiment, was\npart of a patrol which shot and\nkilled the driver and backseat\npassenger of a car which sped\npast them as they patrolled a West Belfast street. He was\nconvicted of the murder of Karen\nReilly, a Belfast teenager, and was\nsentenced to life imprisonment.\nThe public continues to be\nassaulted by press articles\nprotesting at Private Clegg's continued detention in Wakefield prison. The Mail in particular has embarked upon a fairly blatant smear campaign\nagainst Karen Reilly's family.\nThe public's response has been\namazing; the newspaper has\nalready collected one million signatures calling for Clegg's immediate release.\nWhat really happened on\nthat night will never be clear.\nArguments still rage as to\nwhether the group\nof sixteen soldiers\nand a token police\nofficer were ever\ninformed that they were to\noperate against joyriders. The\ntrial was told that the soldiers\nwere explicitly sent out to 'catch'\njoyriders. Clegg's supporters\ninsist that they were never told\nthis, and that the patrol were\neven warned to be extra vigilant\nagainst terrorists that night.\nThe Mail and Telegraph\nhave glossed over the fact that\nthe speeding car did not go\nthrough an official checkpoint,\nthe one they had originally set up\nhaving been disbanded earlier.\nThe group of squad dies and sole\nRUC officer were walking along\nthe road, guns at the ready, in what is known as a moving\ncheckpoint. This is, in effect,\nsimply a term that allows the\npatrol to stop\nBlatant SfTiear passing vehicles.\ncampaign\nThere is no\ndoubt that the\npatrol clearly realised that they\nhad committed an unlawful\nkilling, in that after the shooting\nthey conspired to pervert the\ncourse of justice by claiming that\nthe car had in fact hit one of the\nsoldiers. The members of the\npatrol testified that Private Chris\nA in dow had been hit by the\nAstra, and so attempted to prove\nthat they were in danger, even\nwhen the car was speeding away.\nThis testimony was not\nseriously questioned until the\nRUC officer belatedly, but with\nconsiderable courage, admitted\nthat the car had never struck\nanyone. In an eleven-page\nstatement to the court that\nconvicted Private Clegg, the\nofficer acknowledged that the\npatrol was never in any danger\nand that Private A in dow had\nallowed his leg to be beaten in an\nattempt to justify the killings.\nWhether they knew they\nwere operating against joyriders,\nor whether they really tried to\nstop the car legally does not\nmatter. This act of injuring one\nmember's leg proves that the\nwhole group knew that they\nwould never be able to defend\nwhat they had done as being\noperationally or legally acc ep table.\nAndrew Smith\nMy image of the paras is a product of those hard-nosed BBC2 documentaries that\nshow a punishing regime of\nfrightening peer pressure, and\nquite incredible brutality. I know\nnothing about the logic behind\ntraining, which includes sleep\ndeprivation, laden 20-km runs,\nand the public humiliation and\npunishment of those who can't keep up. But the discipline and\nsingle-mindedness they exemplify seems to be the stuff that\nproduced the fighting we were so\nproud of in the Falklands and\nGulf Wars.\nPrivate Lee Clegg shot an\n18-year-old British girl in the\nback, in a deprived area of one of\nour largest cities. The incongruity of men trained for modern\ncombat dealing with joyriding, a problem so symptomatic of\ninner-city hardship, is quite\noverwhelming. In their barracks,\nthe patrol constructed a celebratory model of the car they\nshot 36 bullets at. A notice read:\n\"Vauxhall Astra. Built by robots.\nDriven by joyriders. Stopped by\n'A' company\".\nBut not only\ndoes this issue raise //\nClegg's dreadful, but non the less unpremeditated, crime is classified in the same terms as the\nhorrors perpetrated by Frederick\nWest. The Court of Appeal and\nthe House of Lords both said that\nthe system would be a much\nfairer if the defendant could be\ncharged with the\nlesser crime of\nBuilt by robots.\nquestions about the . , ' \u201e . manslaughter,\nrole of the army in UHVen 0 / / O/r/O erS. rather than mur-the Province, it\nemphasises the\nvery real need for a change in the law.\nAt present a soldier can be\ncharged with murder, but not\nmanslaughter.\nThe establishment seems to\nbe reluctant to change this for\nfear it would become too easy for\nsoldiers to be charged in the\nfuture. We have a situation where\nStopped by\n'A company\"\nder.\nSoldiers have been res\u2014\npons i ble for 300\nkillings in Ulster, ranging from\narmed members of the IRA to\ncivilians and children. After the\none other successful conviction\nfor murder, Pte Ian Thaine was\nquietly released after serving less\nthan three years. Normally, prisoners given life imprisonment have their cases reviewed\nafter 10 years, and sentences\nserved have usually been in the\nrange of 12-17 years. There was\nan outcry last month when the\nIrish Republic released five IRA\nprisoners, despite the fact that\nthe most serious offence was for\nthe possession of firearms, and\nthat all five had served most of\ntheir sentences.\nOne of the biggest complaints of the nationalists of\nUlster is the lack of accountability of the security services\nwho serve there. They use it as an\nexcuse to perpetuate the bigotry\nand intolerance that inflict the\nprovince. We cannot possibly get\nany further with the peace\nprocess so long as such blatant\ninconsistencies in our system of\njustice remain.\nRachel Walters\nm \u2022 ' \u2022 \u2022Papers come ion I0PGB95 FELIX MM\n\n"

These are names I 've heard from time\nto time and quite often directed to me. \"Just scratch the\nsurface and you're all the same... RACIST!\" yells Sanjay from\nEastEnders after some particularly nasty graffiti is directed at\nhim. Racism exists. It's as impossible to get away from it as it\nis to change the colour of your own skin.\nAnother popular refrain of the racially challenged is \"They're\nall right but would you want your daughter/sister/\nmother/brother/mate to go out with one?\". Mixed-race\nrelationships are a guaranteed way of getting a potential racist\nhot under the collar.\nThere is no better illustration of the 'scratch the surface'\nargument than when a loved one or relative shacks up with\nsomeone of a different complexion. I 've seen perfectly\nreasonable people who have black and Asian friends turn into\nrabid neo fascists at the drop of a hat just because their\ndaughter or son is going out with \"one of them\". And the real\npity is that it is usually the parents who, out of some\nmisplaced protective instinct, get so excited.\nI want to show how you can get involved with whoever\nyou feel like and it can\nwork. It just depends on\nhow important the relationship is to you. I know\nplenty of mixed-race\ncouples who are just ordinary people getting on\nwith their lives. They\ndon't wake up in the\nmornings and say \"I'm in a mixed relationship so let's worry!\", they just live ordinary lives. But for those who expect\nfireworks or just can't understand it, I 'll try to explain this....\nIn order to understand mixed couples, the best thing is to\ntalk to the experienced people, people who have done it or\nare doing it now. First I spoke to Louise, who used to live\nwith a Punjabi Indian guy, Harjinder:\n\"I was kept secret from the parents for quite a while but\nthen Harjinder introduced me to them and it was very weird.\nWhen I'd go to dinner at their house, his mother would ask\n'Do you like the food?' and immediately say in Punjabi 'She\nshould be in the kitchen cooking herself!'. Harjinder would\ntell me what she said afterwards. Maybe it's because I talked\nabout pubs and clubs all the time. I don't think they were\nexpecting that from a nice girl!\"\nHow did people in the street react to them as a couple?\n\"It was really weird because we lived in Cambridge, which is a pretty snobbish place, so people would stare at us. I remember\none time we were in the la und re tte and someone just stuck\ntheir head round the door and shouted ' PAK I!' and ran off.\nHarjinder didn't care but I couldn't believe it; I ran outside\nand the person had just run off.\"\neing subject to racial taunts and abuse is just one of the\nnew things experienced by a white person when they\ngo out' with someone who isn't white. Josie and\nOsmaan have been living together for two years. They first\nstarted seeing each other four years ago but it's still taking\nsome time for the parents to be told the whole story. I asked\nJosie why:\n\"My parents know about Osmaan but they still don't know we live together. Osmaan isn't allowed to answer the\nphone in case it's my parents.\"\nWhat was your parents' reaction when they found out?\n\"My mum became horrified and extremely racist and\nprayed that it was just a phase I was going through. My Dad\nwas just pissed off because he had to deal with my mum but I think he was genuinely concerned that I would get a hard\ntime because of Osmaan.\"\nAnd what about Osmaan and his parents? \"Er, well I haven't actually got round to telling them yet.\" Why not? \"I suppose I'm just running away from the problem. I know they\nwouldn't approve\nbecause they want me\nto marry a nice\nMuslim girl and I can't cope with the\nhassle they would\ngive me.\"\nI asked Josie\nabout how the public\nreacted to them as a couple. \"We don't get any hassle in\nLondon, which isn't surprising as there's loads of n utters to\nworry about. But Osmaan doesn't dare take me to Glasgow,\nwhich is where his family live, because he thinks people will\nstare too much. It is difficult when you notice the way people\nare racist. The first time it happened to me, I almost got us\nbeaten up. The two of us were waiting for a bus late one night\non Tottenham Court Road. I think there'd been a big football\nmatch because a load of fat hooligans passed us completely\npissed. As they went past one of them yelled 'What are you\ndoing with a fucking PAKI?' Osmaan pretended not to hear\nbut I completely lost my temper and screamed 'Fuck off or\nsomething. The whole lot of them turned on us and Osmaan\njust grabbed me and said 'Run!'. Luckily, they were too drunk\nto chase us. I was so shocked that the racism was directed at\nme that I over-reacted. I would never do that again.\"\n\"One of them yelled 'What are you doing with\na fucking Paki?'. I completely lost my temper\nand screamed 'Fuck off!' or something.\nThe whole lot of them turned on us.\"\nT She se hassles exist but they are only anecdotes over a long period of time. Louise and Osmaan are a very\nhappy couple, happier than most same-race couples I know. Let's face it, you can end up being beaten up by a yo b FELIX 10FEB95 "

Hon. Sir Frank Cooper,\nthe present incumbent. A Search\nCommittee, taking its membership from the Governing Body,\nhas been created to form a shortlist of possible candidates for the\nunpaid post.\nThe Rector and two\nacademic staff members,\nProfessors Julia Higgins and\nLester Kerschenbaum, are\namong the seven member panel\ngiven the difficult task. Sir Frank\nhas agreed to stay on as\nChairman, presuming the Privy\nCouncil give their necessary\nassent, until a successor is found.\nHe has however made it quite\nclear that he wishes to retire in\nthe near future having celebrated\nhis 72nd birthday two months\nago.\nWhile a candidate has not\nbeen found for this highly taxing\npost up until now, it is hoped\nthat a recommendation will be\nmade to the Governing Body by\nthe end of this academic year.\nIC Reporter to Report\nWith an initial print run of 5,000\ncopies, the latest attempt to\nproduce a regular Imperial\nCollege staff newspaper hits the\nstands this Tuesday. TC Reporter' as it will be known,\nwill replace the now defunct\nnewspaper 'Network', whose\nincreasingly sporadic output\nfinally ceased last March.\nWith the Press and Public\nRelations Officer, Vicky Browning at the helm as editor,\nand correspondents in every\ndepartment, its four broadsheet\npages is sure to be eagerly\nawaited by all Imperial College\nstaff, who will each be given their\nvery own copy.\nThe Rector of Imperial\nCollege, Professor Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, is known to have been\nconcerned at the lack of a staff\nnewspaper for some time and so\nthe year long wait for this new\npublication is therefore somewhat surprising. The Rector\nwished the college funded paper\nthe 'best of luck' and emphasised\nthat college required such a bulletin to inform staff of college\ndevelopments.\nFELIX readers will be\nhappy to know that Sir Ronald\ndoes not think that TC Reporter'\nwill threaten FELl X's position\nbut rather will 'complement' it\nwith factual articles.\nHalf-Hearted Day\nIan Caldwell, Director of Estates,\ncame in for close questioning\nduring last week's Academic\nAffairs half day.\nDuring a lengthy afternoon\nsession, much discussion centred\non the price of bread. Apparently\nSouthside Shop prices are\npresently of great concern to\nstudents.\nMr Caldwell was also\npressured over the shortage of\ncollege accommodation, particularly considering the influx of\nstudents the medical school\nmerger will bring. He was asked\nto justify the length of time taken\nto replace the fire alarms in Linstead Hall which are still not\nfully operational - over a year\nafter the installation was started.\nThe need for the system was\ndemonstrated last Friday when a small fire started after a student\nleft a candle burning in her\nroom.\nMatthew Szyndel, Academic\nAffairs Officer for the RCSU and\nchief coordinator of the\nproceedings said he was\n'relatively happy' with the\nproceedings. He said that the\nopportunity students had to\nquestion key college staff made\nthe event worthwhile. \"It's the\npeople you've got there listening\nto the response that makes the\ndifference.\"\nMiss Lucy Chothia, ICU President, also agreed saying:\n\"Communication between staff\nand the student body is really\npoor at the moment.\"\nA Poor Start?\nIt's typical.

We only have look at Yugoslavia to\nsee where getting exited about ethnic differences can lead us.\nTo get some words of wisdom about mixed couples, I spoke to\npoet and \"free-thinking intellectual\" Benjamin Zephaniah,\nwho himself has a Pakistani wife:\n\"I don't like talking to journalists about mixed\nrelationships because they always seem to be looking to dig up\ndirt about the subject.\"\nBut what kind of reaction did he get when he got\nmarried?\n\"The reaction was very good and supportive all round.\nAll our friends were very happy and my wife's parents were\nimmediately won over by my charm. I showed some respect of\ntheir culture by learning a bit of Urdu and how to act in front\nof them.\"\nWhat did he think about the argument that I 've often\nheard from my parents: that races cannot intermarry without\ntrouble and that you should not mix your blood?\n\"If you study genetics you see that the difference\nbetween races is genetically very small. The genetic difference\nbetween people coming from different countries is no greater\nthan that between those from the same country. We are all\nfrom the same source in Africa anyway. You also learn that\nmixing of genes is important to produce stronger and smarter\npeople. When you see the problems that inbreeding creates\nyou can see that this is true. This[ not mixing blood]\nargument is wrong because we are all race-mixing all the\ntime.\"\nBut what about cultural identity? \"I'm not saying a person should lose their cultural identity or let themselves be\ncompletely dominated by someone else's; they should be\nproud of what they are. When I was young we were all into\nMalcom X and black identity, but I think it's wrong to say\nany culture is greater than another.\"\nWhat about the reaction he and his wife get on the\nstreet? \"I never get any trouble; in fact, people come up to me,\nbecause my wife is a Pathan and they're a warrior race, and\nsay 'Wow man, how do you do it?'.\" And what kind of advice\nwould he give to younger mixed couples? \"Just take it easy\nand don't worry. I think people should solely judge people on\nwho they are.\"\nT here is a great pressure to conform in any society. We all\nwant to fit in to a certain extent. However, in immigrant\ncommunities the pressure is greatly increased. While\nthis is understandable to the extent that cultural values such\nas language or art should not be eroded, I think it places\nunreasonable demands on the generations to follow,\nparticularly as far as relationships are concerned.\nIn my own family, one of my sisters married a Sikh guy.\nThis produced a more extreme reaction than if she'd married\na white guy. They married happily but were never accepted by\nsome members of the community.\nIt is unreasonable to assume that you can emigrate to a country and not be affected by that country's values. If my\nparents decided that I should live and grow up here, then I can't pretend that I'm still in Pakistan, like many Pakistanis\nin Britain do. I get very irritated by the kind of cultural\nfascism which permeates arguments about mixed\nrelationships. I'm not advocating giving up language and\nculture and becoming completely bland. It's such a great sight\nto walk around London and see so many different cultures\nmixing and living in apparent multiracial harmony; but\nscratch the surface...?

Sss^S^ ff i \u00a9^.if i SB^at}\nWhat you should realise about Union Clubs and Societies\nKeys: Telegraph, Bristol, Snowdonia, 1000ft Nerves: Some of the Union Clubs and Societies' more dangerous sports\nOn Saturday, 28th of January the Daily Telegraph devoted two full pages to an incident that occurred in, what could be consid-ered, familiar circumstances. Colette\nFleetwood was a student at the University of\nthe West of England (Bristol). Colette joined\nthe Universities Fell Walking Club. On her\nvery first Club trip, to Snowdonia, Colette\ndied.\nI do not want to place the blame on any-one, but I will give a brief account of what\nhappened. Colette was inexperienced in fell\nwalking, she attended the trips \"pre-meet-ing\", and then the Club set off for the Welsh\nmountainside. As explained in the Telegraph,\nColette and her friend found the Club atmosphere unapproachable (something common\namongst our Clubs) but decided to go on the\ntrip anyway keeping to each others' company.\nIt was reported that appropriate precautions\nwere not taken considering the weather,\nclothes and equipment. Colette was placed in\na group walk that was much too difficult for\nher ability. She was told that the route consisted of \"some s cree with a bit of scram-bling\". The Telegraph reports \"there was no\n'safe' route to the summit\". Colette lost her\nlife when a gust of wind blew her off a snowfield and she fell 1000ft. The article explains that the university\nvice-chancellor met Colettes parents at the\nmemorial service; \"After expressing his con-do len ces, Morris told them [...] that the university and union were 'completely separate'\nand that the accident was 'a matter for the\nstudents' union'\". The University of West\nEngland (UWE) funds its' Students' Union in\nthe same way as Imperial College. The\nStudents' Union receives a \"block grant\"\nfrom the parent college. I would be extremely\ndisappointed if Imperial College reacted in\nthe same way as UWE. Imperial College\nUnion has a very close relationship with the\nCollege and we believe that this link would\nnot disappear in similar circumstances. At\nthis college the Union works very closely\nwith the Health Centre and Safety Unit. We\nare available to give advice and help anyone.\nSee the numbers at the end of the article.\nSports like mountaineering and fell\nwalking regard themselves as having an ethos\nof \"individual initiative and self reliance\". If\nstudents wish to take part in these activities\nthen they decide so as adults, understanding\nthe risks. Before going on a trip everyone\nmust be made aware of the risks involved. In\nColettes case, she was not aware of these risks,\nand placed her faith in the expedition leaders.\nThe leaders of our Clubs could be considered\nresponsible for their members on expeditions. I am writing this because I am shit scared\nof a member of college being involved in an\naccident. It may not have happened so far,\nbut accidents do happen and the after shocks\ntremble for a long time. Whenever you consider going on any trip or activity, please\nmake sure that you are happy with the\narrangements. Make sure that you feel com-for table. If you are in doubt then stand up\nand shout. Life is too sweet to waste it away\non being scared to ask questions.\nFull copies of the Telegraph's report are\navailable from me, Ian Parish, Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies), in the Union\noffice.\nPhone numbers:\nIan Parish\nOffice: 0171 594 8060, 58063 internal\nHome: 0171 594 8063, 48063 internal\nIan Gillett (Safety Director)\nOffice: 0171 594 9420,49420 internal\nMobile: 0860 333 615, 23 350 internal\nFELIX1 DP EB95 "

Thanks to the cunning of the\nscript writers, the plot revolves\naround the Nexus, a place where\nall your dreams come true, which\nallows both new and old captains\nto meet. And so Captain Kirk, with\nCaptain Picard, returns to the good\nold days saving the universe once\nmore.\nThe prologue to 'Generations'\nstarts with the grand launch of the\nEnterprise-B, this time with\nCaptain Kirk attending as a guest\nand not as captain. As usual the\nscenes have that wry humour\nindicative of the original series as\nKirk desperately wants to get back\ninto that captain's chair again. The\nprologue then ends with the\ndisappearance of Kirk into the\nNexus and the arrival of Dr. Saron\n(//la/com McDowell) onto the\nscene. The film then jumps some\n80 years to the future where the\nNext Generation crew have to deal\nwith Dr Saron's dastardly plan to\nreturn to the Nexus.\nThe original 'Star Trek' was\nmore of a western in outer space,\nand when Next Generation came\nto television it relied on special\neffects, scientific words and\npolitical correctness. 'Star Trek\nGenerations' is pretty much on the\nsame lines as the television\nepisode: 10 minutes being\ndevoted to the minor characters\nand numerous subplots and before\nleading back to the final show\ndown; Malcom McDowell verses\nCaptains Picard and Kirk.\nThe film sets are exactly the\nsame, though the use of moody\ndark shadows and the wide screen\nattempts to hide the fact nothing\nhas changed. Undoubtedly filmed\nstraight after the last of the\ntelevision series, 'Generations' kills\noff the possibility of any more\noriginal 'Star Trek' films and\nbridges the gap to a new series of\nNext Generation films, (with the\nadded bonus of obtaining a couple\nof bob on the merchandising).\n'Generations' feels just like an\nextended television plot but all the\ncharacters have major scenes\ndevoted to them although these\nare mostly unrelated. The most\nnotable acting comes from\nMalcom McDowell as he is in an\nunusual role, though it does show\nthat there are still acting roles\navailable for holding men.\nIf you are a fan of the\ntelevision series you will not be\ndisappointed with 'Generations'.\nJust like the television episodes it\nflows well for the two hours\nduration, the special effects are\nspread thickly throughout the film\nand it keeps you watching. 0\n\n"

    "content": "News\nMerger Thwarted\nBY ANDYS IN HA RAY The creation of one of the largest\nmedical schools in the country\nwas thwarted last week as a bill to\nmerge St Bartholemew's and the\nRoyal London Hospital Medical\nSchools with Queen Mary and\nWestfield College ( Q MW) was\ndefeated in the House of\nCommons.\nThe bill, blocked at the\neleventh hour by Labour MPs lead by Bryan Sedgemoor, the\nMember of Parliament for\nHackney and Shoreditch, could\naffect the already difficult merger\nof Barts with the Royal London\nand means that it is now unlikely\nto take place this year.\nMr Sedgemoor MP was\nconcerned at the possible\nrelocation of the medical schools\nin any merger. However,\nspeaking to FELIX, David Jaynes, Academic Secretary at\nQ MW said that re-siting of the\ncolleges had not yet been\nconsidered. He added that\ncurrent proposals would in fact\nhave developed the Royal\nLondon's Whitechapel site.\nMr Jaynes did not seem\nsurprised at the bill's failure.\n\"We knew it would happen ...\nthere have been doubts over the\nfuture of Barts and this arouses\nstrong passions with an\ninstitution with such history,\" he\nremarked.\nDr Julian Axe, college\nsecretary at Barts, suggested that\nthe issue had more to do with the\nfuture of the NHS in London\nbeing decided 'by MPs who\nbelieve that central ising is not\nthe right option'. He felt that\nthey were benefiting from\nworking within the Tomlinson\nreport of 1992, which_ re com mended the merger of medical\nschools and the closure of\nhospitals in London. \"There's a good synergy between London\nand Barts\", he said. Merging\nwould save money and would\nhelp to meet HM Treasury\nguidelines which recommend\nsavings of 3% each year, over the\nnext 3 years. Certain resources\nwould have to be re-allocated to\ndifferent areas, and in many cases\nstaff positions would be created.\nRepresentatives from the\ncolleges are confident that the\nmerger will go ahead anyway.\nQMW's principal, Prof. Graham\nZellick, said: \"We believe the bill\nwill be passed and receive Royal\nAssent despite the blocking\nmotion... detailed work continues\nand the three colleges remain\nfirmly committed to the merger.\"\nJulian Axe agreed: \"It's just\na question of when it's going to\nhappen, rather than if ... and it\ncould be something rather\nexciting.\"\nAnd they're off!\nBY ANDREW TSENG NEWS EDITOR AT. The first event on the\n&Smb 1994/1995 sabbatical\nM \u00a3 \u00ab election timetable has\n^ \u2022 J^^<? arrived. Papers went\nup on Monday for the\nfour posts: President, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services),\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) and FELIX Editor &\nPrint Unit Manager.\nAs we went to press, five\ncandidates had declared them-selves. The declared candidates\nare: for President: Kevin Ward,\nPhysics; for Deputy President\n( F&S): Matthew Crompton,\nGeology and Annie Matthewman,\nComputing; for Deputy President\n(C&S): Maryam Yahyavi,\nPhysics; for FELIX Editor and\nPrint Unit Manager: Rachel\nWalters, Chemistry.\nWith one week remaining\nuntil papers come down, election\nspeculation is still the focus of\nattention. Last week's academic\naffairs half day saw two Dep\nReps, Sarah White of Geology\nand Miles Ambler of Chemistry,\nmake speeches that some have\nseen as blatant electioneering.\nFELIX understands that Ms White is the reason behind the\nmass resignation of R SMU officials from the elections\ncommittee and she is therefore\nlikely to have strong R SMU support.\nRumours of Miles Ambler's. candidacy have been surrounded\nby controversy. Mr Ambler only\nthis week resigned from the\nelections committee, citing a conflict of interest. When randomly selected to be part of\nthe committee and asked by Lucy\nChothia, ICU President, whether\nhe had a conflict of interest, Mr Ambler had originally denied\nthat he was considering running\nfor President.\nSuggestions that Simon\nGovier, senior ICU steward and\nformer FELIX business\nmanager, intends to stand for\nDeputy President ( F&S) have\nreached FELIX. When asked,\nMr Govier gave a passionate but\ncontradictory response. Paul\nDias, the subject of much\nspeculation, is also still at large.\nThough five candidates have\nbeen declared, as we went to press\nonly two of them, Rachel Walters\nand Maryam Yahyavi had been\nfully seconded. Ms Walters took\nless than a day to reach the\nrequired twenty second ers. Papers come down next\nFriday, after which those\nstanding will have to persuade\nthe Imperial community that\nthey should be given a sabbatical\npost when voting takes place on\n6th and 7th of March.\nOnce again Imperial College Dance Team met with success at the annual 'Shefield Social', writes Michael Ludlam.

I would think that students, both\nundergraduate and research,\nwould largely be in favour of it.\nAnd there are arguments that can\nbe made, as long as one treats\nstudents as grown-up, rational\nbeings, that access should not be\nrestricted to the so-called normal\nworking day.\nManor's campaign should\nonly be seen as a seed, and should\nbe taken up to open access to\nCollege totally. Why should only\nthe Computing labs be open 24\nhours a day? Open all the\nlaboratories, the libraries, the\nshops, the bars, the restaurants.\nLet members of College access and\nuse them when they want.The\nargument for the whole access-ability debate stems from this\nsimple fact: students are adults\n(they pay rents, take out loans,\nhave bank accounts, etc). If they\nwant to ruin their lives by spending\n24 hours drinking then let them. If\nthey want to ruin their health by\nspending 24 hours in front of a terminal, then who is College to\nact as moral nanny? There are\npractical considerations to full\naccess ability, but these do not\ndiscount the basic libertarian\nargument.\nThe whole issue is just an\nexample of College being run by\nwell behaved engineers: \"A normal\nworking day is between the hours\nof 9 and 5, why would anyone\nwant to work at night instead?\"\nUnfortunately, the 24-hour access\ncampaign may fizzle out because\nDepartments are largely populated\nby well behaved engineers: \"It\ndoesn't really effect me, why\nshould I care?\" The idea of doing\nsomething, anything, differently is\nalien. Why do you want to take this\nroute, when everyone else takes\nthat one and has always taken it, is\nthe bewildered question.\nThe irony of the whole thing\nis that science is sold as a liberator;\nsomething which allows one to\nmove ahead with new concepts.\nThe argument of the science\neducators, \"why do you want it like\nthis, when it's always been done\nlike that?\", sounds like Middle\nEngland on Nick Ross. I originally\nstarted off by thinking that\northodoxy was a scheme, a dogma. But it's not: it's just\nescapism. \"Yes, yes, it really will be\nalright once we all get back to\nthose days of aunts cycling down\nthe church lane in the afternoon\nsun.\"\nSamin\nGate crash Guest columnists respond to\nSamin's recent accusations ...\nOrganised Piffle:\nT.H. Huxley described science as\n\"organised common sense\". In the\nsame vein, Bertrand Russell\ndescribed philosophy as \"organised\npiffle\". Doubtless in order to\nexemplify this profound aphorism,\nRussell devised the parable of the\n'induct iv is t turkey'. On the very first\nmorning of the day that it was\nhatched, a young turkey noticed\nthat the farmer brought him and\nhis siblings food at 9:00 am. The\nsame thing happened on the\nsecond day, the third day and so\non, until one day the turkey\ninduced that \"We will always be\nfed at 9:00 am.\". Sadly on that\nvery same day, he had his throat\ncut, for it was Christmas.\nRussell created this parable\nin order to discredit inductive logic.\nFor the same reason this parable\nwas adopted by Popper, and by all\nothers who want to discredit the\ngeneral validity of the scientific\ntruth, objectivity and method. The\nparable was most recently repeated\nby Samin in FELIX (1018). Note that\nall these people failed to see that\nagainst induction they all the time\nargued inductively! But let this pass.\nHowever, how sound is the\n'logic' of the 'induct iv is t turkey'? Is\nit in the same class as the logic\nemployed by Galileo, Newton, and\nHuxley? Is it as valid as the logic\nroutinely used by surgeons\nperforming successful operations,\nor by engineers who build real,\nsuccessful aircraft?\nAnyhow, even the likes of\nRussell and Popper, when it really\nmattered, abided by all inductive\nlaws that needed obeying in order\nto stay alive: they never cut across\nthe path of speeding trucks; they\nnever jumped unprotected from\ngreat heights; and so on. Both\nRussell and Popper lived well into\ntheir nineties.\nIt may even be significant\nthat in the parable, Russell had a turkey to serve as his spokes-person. We suspect that Russell's sub consciousness somehow played\na role here. What it seems is that\nRussell's subconscious mind is\ncrying out to tell us this: \"I, Bertrand Russell, have the brain of\na bird!\".\nWe trust that there are many\npeople in Imperial College who\nhave developed cognitive faculties\non a higher evolutionary plane\nthan those of a bird, and who also\nhave the wit to use them.\nTheocharis Mookherjee Saridakis\nCrossword by Nyami Nyami\nSolution to last week's Crossword:\nAcross: 1.Abides, 9.Wristwatch, 10.Mirror, ll.Capybara, 12.lso pre ne,13.

The zodiac,\na word derived from the Greek zo dia kos, meaning '(a circle) of animals', is\nused to predict your future, depending\nupon which sign you were 'born\nunder'.\nLove them or loathe them, these\npredictions, or horoscopes, are a large\npart of today's culture... and are about\nto undergo a radical change. Recent\ndiscoveries suggest that the star sign\nyou once thought you were is no\nlonger valid. A complete shift in the\nzodiac could mean that your true personality now follows the traits of the\npreceding star sign. For instance, if your birthday is on 30th March, instead of being a fiery, passionate\nAries, you are actually a dreamy\nPisces.\nFor many people this could be\nalarming. You may have been following the wrong advice - a bit of a problem if you have been quitting\njobs, dumping partners and so on,\nhappy in the knowledge that this temporary misery will eventually lead to a fulfilling and exciting future - it\nwon't. So now you're thinking of\nthrowing in the towel... better consult\nyour horoscope... but which one?\nOf course this could be enlightening. If your star sign predicts you to\nbe introverted, hard-working and boring but you find it hard to fit into this\nmodel, it could well be that your new\nstar sign says you are the vivacious,\ndrop-dead gorgeous lu r ve god you\nalways knew you were!\nSo why the change? Well, astronomers claim there is a thirteenth sign, previously omitted from\nthe original zodiac. The zodiac was\ndrawn up by the Egyptians, who used\nit as a time-measuring device rather\nthan a means by which to spot partners and pitfalls. It works by following\nthe path of the sun through, initially,\ntwelve constellations of stars. The\ndays of the year were divided up\nIf m equally into twelve, on the assumption\nthat the sun stays in each constellation\nfor the same length of time. No-one\never questioned this because the stars\ncome out at night, when we cannot see\nthe sun.\nAccording to the Royal\nAstronomical Society, the sun passes\nthrough a previously undetected thirteenth constellation, which leads us to\nthis thirteenth sign of the zodiac -Ophiuchus - named after Aschlepius,\nthe Greek God of healing. This sign is\ninserted between Scorpio and\nSagittarius in the original zodiac, so if\nyou were born between November\n30th and December 17th, you now\nhave a star sign of your own -Ophiuchus. This results in a general\nshift and shortening of the other star\nsigns. However, this isn't the only way\nin which the new zodiac will differ\nfrom the traditional one. The International Astronomical Union suggests that the year should not be\ndivided up equally. Instead, the signs\nshould be assigned different numbers\nof days according to the different sizes\nof the constellations.\nThe result of all this change is\nthat the zodiac is now completely different, and very few people will keep\ntheir original star sign. But how do\nwe, the horoscope-reading public,\nrespond to such changes? The general\nconsensus of people I 've spoken to is,\nwhy change it? Many people feel that\nthe personality predicted by their star\nsign is an accurate description of their\ntrue personality. Or is it that we\nchange to live up to our star sign? And\nwhat about all the mugs, tea towels, Tshirts, books and personalised\nhoroscopes that we've invested\ngood money in?\nIn my opinion, changing\nthe zodiac is useless. Although I enjoy reading about my fate as\nan Aquarius (especially when I found a book that spent an\nentire page telling me how gorgeously attractive I was!), I don't place too much emphasis on\nwhat it tells me.\nWe all know, deep down,\nthat it's just a bit of fun. If horoscopes were true, it would imply\nthat one-twelfth of the population will all have similar events\nhappen to them each day. You have to\nagree that's a ridiculous notion. And horoscopes are so often wrong. I 've\nlost count of the number of times I 've\nspent days waiting for 'the big\nromance of the year' or 'a large windfall of money'. In fact the horoscopes\nare wrong as many times as they are\nright - and this would still be true for\nmy new sign.\nMy mother has an amazing talent for reading things into horoscopes\nthat no-one else can. For example, if\nshe read that 'Today you will suffer\nthe consequences of something you\ndid yesterday that you suspected to be\nwrong', my mum would probably say\n\"Oh dear, I suspected that milk I drank yesterday could have been off...\nI 'll be ill today then... better take the\nday off work.\" Milk? I would have\nexpected it to mean illicit affairs or\nmild criminal action, not mouldy\nmilk!\nBut back to the issue. I really\nfeel astronomers should leave the\nzodiac alone. Of course, this has\nabsolutely nothing to do with me\nreading up about Capricorn (the star\nsign that the new zodiac would make\nme) and deciding that I prefer the\nsound of Aquarius! Horoscopes are\njust a bit of fun, and astronomers\nshould lighten up, get a life and keep\ntheir noses out of astrology.\nIncidentally, my horoscope for\nthis year says my love life will take a turn for the better, my career\nprospects will drastically improve, and\nI will pass my end of year exams - I have to believe this... horoscopes don't fail me now!
