    "content": "The Delator Column\nTelephone exchange\nI won't comment at length on the ambulance dispute\nuntil a settlement has been reached. There is,\nhowever, one recent incident which is worthy of note.\nAmbulance controllers took a decision to stop the\npublic calling depots themselves by dialling the\nnumber of their unlisted direct line (as appeared in last\nweeks Felix). The ambulance chiefs asked British\nTelecom to change the numbers of these lines to stop\nthe public calling in. The decision to do this is appalling\nand morally indefensible. If deaths arise due to this\naction, the blame will lay squarely on the shoulders\nof the controllers, and ultimately the Secretary of\nMoonlighting\nBy Paul Shanley\nState.\nNB The Phone number given in last weeks Felix for\nBattersea Ambulance Station was stated as 01-223\n9918. This should have read 01-223 9198.\nLast Monday's 'World in Action' detailed conflicts of\ninterest that arise when an MP takes on a secondary\njob outside the House of Commons.\nThe problem is an old one. Many members are\nrel unc tant to sever business contacts on election to\nParliament. Others, particularly opposition MPs, take\non extra work to avoid the tedium of the house.\nCurrently, members must not involve themselves\nin activities that would enable them to benefit unfairly\nfrom. This is obviously the case with regard to share\nportfolios that a member may possess.\nThe ITV programme listed many examples of MPs\nusing their parliamentary privilege to make money in\nthe outside world. It also documented instances\nwhere members did not declare an interest before\nspeaking in a debate or putting their name to a motion.\nThe present guidelines governing members' private\nactivities are laid down in Erskine May, the\nParliamentary rule book, and in confidential\nmemoranda issued by the Prime Minister's office. A select committee-the committee of member's interests-requires all MPs to list 'any payments or\nadvantages' that may have a bearing on their political\nconduct in The Register of Member's Interests. They\nmust also record in the register any instances of being\nentertained by a foreign government.\nThis rule is frequently flaunted. Of the 650\nmembers, 385 have commercial interests despite\nbeing paid as full-time MPs. A further 37 run\nconsultancy businesses which frequently clash with\ntheir duties as representatives of the public.\nIn the recent tendering of cleaning and catering\ncontracts in hospitals, twenty MPs spoke on the\ndebate without declaring an interest. All are either\ndirectors or on the board of firms who applied for\nthese contracts.\nThe rules are often broken by Commons staff. The\nmember for Kensington and Chelsea, Peter Brooke,\nemploys a secretary who has, in the past, arranged\ncontacts with various MPs in return for sums of cash.\nIt is arguable whether such an 'introduction fee' is an\nacceptable situation or whether it should be regarded\nas mickey-money.\nAt local government level, councillors are barred\nfrom voting.or taking part in a debate in which they\nhave a vested interest. Why can't the same be true\nat national level?\nThere are two options open if government is to\nperform without bias. Both require that members face\ndisciplinary action if found guilty of not declaring a business interest.\nThe first solution is to disqualify members from\nvoting when the item of debate is listed in the Register\nof Members Interests. This is something that the\nSpeaker would have to administer.\nThe second scheme is to treat all MPs as employed\nin a full-time job. They would be disbarred from taking\non any outside work. At a current rate for the job of\n\u00a326,000 per year plus the same again in working\nexpenses, this may stop many candidates from\nstanding for election. They would probably earn more\noutside the House.\nThe purpose of electing representatives is to ensure\nthat they discuss and vote on policy at its face value.\nIf their judgement is impaired by their own\ninvestments or business interests, then they should\nnot be part of the decision-making process.\n10 Page\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX photographer, Roland Flowerdew, investigates the displays at the Eurotunnel project and finds out 'How you\nwill use the tunnel. '\nEurotunnel exhibition\nAs the official brochure states, the purpose of the\nEurotunnel Exhibition Centre is to allow the general\npublic to follow 'the progress of this exciting\nengineering project'.\nThe Centre entrance is constructed to look like a simplified cross-section of the tunnel itself, complete\nwith train emerging. The way in is through a door in\nthe side of the train. Once inside, you can go straight\ninto the exhibition or up the observation tower. The\nlatter is well worth doing: although it is not particularly\nhigh it overlooks the IV120 and the entire Cheriton\nterminal site. In the distance can be seen the mouth\nof the tunnels.\nThe exhibition itself starts with a section entitled\n'How you will use the tunnel', and explains the\nadvantages of a fixed Channel link: how much time\nit will save, and how convenient it will be. However,\nit does provide solid information rather than a sales\nwaffle of vague promises. There are several detailed\nmodels of cars and trucks being loaded into the shuttle\ntrain wagons.\nThis leads on into a section about the tunnel itself,\nand is dominated by an 'interactive map of Europe'.\nThis is an electronic 'guess the time between UK and\neuropean cities via Eurotunnel' game, and is\ncompletely mono polis ed by small children pressing the\nbuttons. It also emits loud electronic music which is\nrather annoying when heard for the nth time, it can\nbe heard from most of the rest of the exhibition. The\nhistory of the tunnel is catered for by a section,\ncomplete with mining trolleys and wooden beams, on\nprevious attempts at constructing a fixed link, of\nwhich there were quite a number.\nYou then walk through a full size model of the\ncutting face of a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) to find\nout how the tunnels are being bored and constructed.\nThere is a model of a large TBM, and this\ndemonstrates the continuous process going on. The\nspoil is brought back from the cutting face on\nconveyor belts and loaded onto a train, this same train\nhas brought up the pre-cast concrete lining, which is\nfitted in, then rails are extended and the TBM moves\non. The TBM is held in place by giant pressure pads\nthat squeeze against the walls of the tunnel, similar\nto the way a worm moves through the ground.\nVideo systems are abundant, many with selectable\nprogrammes to allow choice of aspects about the\ntunnel that interest you. The main audio-visual\npresentation is given in a spear ate theatre (with very\ncomfortable seats). This again is informative rather\nthan a sales spiel, but it is rather in need of an update\non the latest progress.\nThe big attraction for members of the IC train\nspotting club will be the large N gauge layout\nmodelling the two termini, although their eyes for\ndetail will immediately notice that all non-essential\npoint work is merely rails butted against each other.\nThis, and the fact that the Channel is represented by\na gold fish tank, rather spoil what is otherwise an\nimpressive model. While I was watching it I witnessed\na near collision; two trains were converging onto a single piece of track and catastrophe was only averted\nby an operator bodily lifting one of the trains off the\ntrack. So much for the computer control system!\nThe exhibition concludes with a large souvenir shop\n(buy a mug made with Eurotunnel clay), and a cafe.\nIf you can afford to, sample some of the wares of the\nlatter, it is considerably better than British Rail's standard.\nConclusion: this exhibition is well-presented and\nworth seeing if you are in the area. If travelling straight\nfrom London it wold be best to combine a visit to this\nwith something else as it takes less than two hours\nto see in entirety. The Eurotunnel Exhibition Centre\nis reached by taking junction 12 off the M20 and\nfollowing the signs, or by train from Charing Cross to\nFolkstone. It is open Tuesdays to Sundays inclusive\nbetween 10am and 5pm. Adult admission is currently\n\u00a32.50, U16's \u00a31.50.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "On Monday we wandered through the Passages on\nthe Right Bank. This is the commercial area of Paris\nand consists of small shops in covered alleyways.\nThese sell everything from textiles to shop\nmannequins and are both wholesale and retail. The\neffect is rather like walking through the fashion areas\nof Soho. The atmosphere is of money being scraped\ntogether in seedy little back rooms and large wads of\nfrancs changing hands to avoid the taxman.\nAfter one more chocolat, we stocked up on cheap\nwine and headed back to the airport, exhausted but\nfascinated by the magic of Paris.\nCulinary Delights\nParis is not only a cultural but a culinary experience.\nEven on a limited budget it is possible to eat well\u2014if\nyou know the right places. One of the most amazing,\nand the cheapest is Casa Miguel on the rue St\nGeorges, where you can have a three course meal\nwith wine for 5F( about 50p)l This 'restaurant' is run\nby an eccentric old French lady and whilst the wine\nis watered and the food is simple, it is well-cooked\nand quite filling.\nParis is also full of other surprises. Rue Etex boasts\nthe Port de Pidjiguiti, a restaurant owned by a Village\nin Guinea-Bissau. The villagers take turns in coming\nto Paris to run the restaurant and all profits go back\nto the village. The place is spartan and inelegant, but\nthe food is superb-traditional French African cooking,\nmostly delicately spiced meat stews with rice. It's certainly an unusual place and a great talking point\nwhen you get home.\nFor more traditional French restaurant fare, there are\nmany small restaurants serving fixed price menus,\nwith a choice of starter, main course, dessert and a quarter litre of wine for 40-50F( about 4-5). We tried\nthe Restaurant des Beaux-Arts on Rue Bonaparte,\nwhere the portions are generous, the food pleasant\nand the staff cheerful and friendly as well as used to\ntourists. The restaurant is named after the Ecole des\nBeaux Arts, the School of Fine Art, on the same road.\nFor lunch we bought food from the supermarkets,\nwhich pride themselves in excellent bread\neverywhere, or ate ham baguettes that are sold from\nWSSmstalls on almost all the main streets. For relaxing after\na long walk across the city or for starting the morning\nin a leisurely fashion, nothing could beat sitting\noutside a cafe with a steaming chocolat and a hot\nbuttered baguette or croissant. We were also often\ntempted by the bottles of wine at 7F(70p) a litre\nwhich proved to be passably drinkable if you don't mind your wine a little rough.\nOn Sunday night, as we had gone to Paris for a celebration, we splashed out on our one expensive\nmeal of the stay. This was at the Cafe de la Jatte,\non the He de la Jatte to the northwest of Paris where\nthe Seine curves and flows north. Reached by a psychedelic ally decorated passage, the restaurant is\nin a converted artist's studio overlooking a leafy\ncourtyard. The decor is as odd as the entrance: a full\nscale brontosaurus replica hangs from the ceiling. The\nwalls are hung with contemporary paintings which are\nfor sale; while we were there these were large,\nHH H colourful, primitive paintings of underwater scenes.\nThe waiting staff are definitely of the resting actor\nschool, young, chic and with an air of being above the\nbourgeois customers, whilst providing excellent\nservice. The food is superb. In large green salads at\n70F( \u00a37), crisp lettuce conceals half avocados\nsculpted like shells and filled with crab meat. The main\ndishes include fish specialities, although the steaks are\nalso good and they serve the excellent, rich ice creams\nand sorbets one finds so often on the continent. The\nmeal was not cheap, about 450F( \u00a345) for two with\nwine, and the usual class of clientele can be judged\nfrom the man at the next table who lean t over, asked\nto see the wine we had ordered and told us it was\nfrom his friend's vineyard. But the meal was well\nworth it and it was very pleasant to wander along the\nedge of the river on our way home sav our ing the\ndelights of our Parisian weekend.\nHow to get there and what it costs\nWe flew Air Europe, the cheapest 'normal' flight at\nabout \u00a360 return, booked through Nouvelles Frontiers,\n1 -2 Hanover Street, W1 (01-629 7772). The cheapest\nflights are the student charters to Beauvais, which\ninclude an hour and a quarter coach ride to the centre\nof Paris and which arrive late at night*. This can be\nbooked through USIT, 52 Grosvenor Gardens, London\nSW1 (01-7308111) + . It is also possible to travel by\ncoach/train and hovercraft/ferry. STA Travel at\nImperial on the walkway should be able to help you\nwith this and the above flights.\nTravel around Paris is best done by buying a Carte\nHebdominaire (a weekly Metro/RER pass), or for a short trip, car nets( books) of ten single tickets are\ncheaper than buying single tickets. The same tickets\ncan be used on buses.\nExpect to pay \u00a310-\u00a320 for a double room, but don't expect any frills. It is possible to survive on \u00a320 a day\nper person, but you have to be strong willed about\ndiving into cafes and bars and paying for museums.\n\u00a330 per person should be comfortable.\nFinally, the best book around is 'The Rough Guide\nto Paris' by Kate Baillie and Tim Salmon, published by\nHarrap Columbus at about \u00a35. Updated every couple\nof years, this not only tells you where to stay and eat,\nbut gives you insight into the museums, culture and\nhistory of the Paris streets and is well recommended.\n\"About \u00a330 each way-it depends on exactly when\nyou fly.\n+ Dan Air run a student charter which costs \u00a368.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Psychedelic Furs Competition Two free tickets to be won...\nAfter the release of the Book of Days album and a secret gig in\nNovember last year under the pseudonym 'Book of Days', the\nPsychedelic Furs are playing a full tour of Britain and we have two\ntickets to be won for the last night of the tour at Brixton Academy\non February 6.\nAll frustrated Furs fans need to do is attempt the two simple\nquestions and the tie-break below and get the answers into the FELIX\nOffice before Tuesday January 30.\n1. Which two members of the band are brothers and what do\nthey play?\n2. Who designed the cover of the band's first album?\nTie-break:- How many singles have the Psychedlic Furs released\nsince they formed?\nThe winner will be drawn from the correct or closest entries on\nTuesday 30 and printed in FELIX on Friday 2 February.\nHot hits at winter time\nHo, Ho, Ho, and a bottle of rum and a sackful of CDs.\nYup, despite retailers protests about a slack year,\nprofits being down (or not as 'up' as normal) they're\nstill profits, money in the hand and return on\ninvestments with gold knobs on.\nOne area not complaining were the record\ncompanies 'cos us consumers like to give each other\nnice press ies and what could be nicer than that old\nguitar hero Mr Eric (I'm not God really but so far I 've\nsurvived drink, drugs, Italian actresses and singing\nwith Tina Turner so I'm probably immortal) Clapton.\nHe's come a long way since the Yardbirds but despite\nhis multi platinum status still feels the urge to totter\ninto the studio to spank the plank for our benefit, and\nthat of his bank balance. Journeyman is a medium rare\ncook in' of the blues aided by the talents of Bad Bob\nCray and supplemented with sufficient MOR fodder\nto satisfy Michelle and Dave who only really like the\nsingles but will go to one of his eighteen nights at the\nR.A.H. 'cos its trendy and he's bound to play Layla\n. There is little on this except perhaps Old Love and\nNo Alibis to elevate it to classic status but it is all\npleasant enough if you like that sort of thing and gives\nhim a basis for some spine-tingling guitar\nimprovisation when he plays it all live.\nOne strange marketing ploy was to put out Hue and\nCry's live Bitter Suite with Remote thrown in for\nnothing, especially just before Xmas when no one\ngives anything away. Surely only diehards will be keen\nto hear the Kane bros acoustic versions and they'd all have Remote anyway? Dunno about all that but it's quite good. Reminding themselves of 'exactly what\nH&C are about' they ham it up on Looking for Linda\nand Round Midnight, murder Kate Bush's Man with\nChild in his Eyes and emerge with overall credit from\nTruth, Remote and Costello's Shipbuilding. Patrick's voice lacks a certain piquancy (warmth, depth and\nrange) and so fails to make it as a torch chant eur and\nGreg is too ham fist ed ever to tinkle the ivories at the\nPage 6\nRitz but the whole caboodle is okay fun if you like that\nsort of thing.\nMoving on into really intelligent music,\nWhitesnake's sub t ely titled Slip of the Tongue beats\naround the bush (as it were) with Kitten's Got Claws\nand Cheap An' Nasty, flirts with Aramgedon on\nJudgement Day and really drives the point home (so\nto speak) on Slow Poke Music. Not for the prudish or\nthose with delicate hearing. David Coverdale's howls\nand Steve Vai, Riff-fy nder general s qu eels over\nthunderous and at times monotonous backing to put\nany metal freaks (who like this sort of thing) onto\ncloud ten.\nBut he who releases latest laughs at no 1 longest\nand good old chirp y cockney boy next door, Phil\nCollins has done just that. Two weeks since Xmas and\npeople are still buying it-how come? Well, you\nremake the first three albums almost to the note right\ndown to the melancholy woodblock on That's Just\nthe Way It Is. This time it is suitably serious,\naddressing the issues that really matter: Starvation\n[Colours), Vagrancy {Another Day in Paradise) and the\nweather (/ Wish It Would Rain Down). It is all lovely\nstuff for us but about as fresh as the turkey would\nbe if we ate it four times in eight years and at least\nwe wouldn't find bits in our teeth for months after to\nremind us of it like we will the seven singles that will\nbe released as the PC machine chugs its way round\nthe universe on tour. Still we all like this sort of thing\ndon't we and it is no 1 unlike NOW 16 which is a great\ncollection this time round. Enya and Kate Bush rub\nshoulders with Bobby Brown and Technotronic as well\nas the usual crop of 'previously unreleased and its\nobvious why' make weights to pad the thing out.\nFinally a short word about the Jive Bunny album\nincluding all the singles (well two out of three) and\nsome exciting new mixes....CRAP!! Does anybody like\nthis sort of thing?\nCDL.\n\u2022 Research into Muscular Dystrophy made a significant discovery when a man was found whose\nDNA was lacking half a particular gene.\nThis gene, for dys troph in, is vital for muscle\nfunction and yet the 61 year old man was leading a normal life. It is hoped that this half gene may, in the\nfuture, provide a means of treating severe cases. Gene\ntherapy would be used where it has been suggested\nthat the half gene may be small enough to be inserted\ninto a virus. This could then enter the patient's cells\ntaking the healthy genes into their chromosomes\nreplacing the defective genes which cause this\npara ly sing disease.\n\u2022 A neutrino detector to be built in Canada will be\nthe largest and most sensitive of its kind in the world.\nThe project, costing $61 million, will be funded mainly\nby the Canadian Government ($35 million) with the\nremainder from federal agencies in Canada, US\nDepartment of Energy and, subject to approval, the\nScience and Engineering Research Council in Britain.\nThe detector which is claimed to be more than 50\ntimes more sensitive than its con tempo ries, is based\non an acrylic cylinder containing 1000 tonnes of\nheavy water. This is surrounded by an array of 2000\nphotomultiplier s. One type of neutrino may react with\nthe deuterium molecules with such an event\nproducing a pulse of Cerenkov radiation. The detector\nis encased by very pure water and is situated 2 km\nunderground in order to reduce interference from\nbackground radiation.\n\u2022 The Japanese Government has given the go\nahead for the development of a superconducting\nmagnetically levitated train. A budget of \u00a332 million\nhas been approved for the construction of a43 km\ntest track due to be commissioned in 1994. If\nsuccessful it could become part of a railway network,\nwith trains running at speeds of up to 500 km/h. This type of train would be in competition with the\ncurrent, conventional French TGV (train a grande\nvitesse). This recently achieved a speed of 482.4\nkm/h and is hoped to exceed 500 km/h eventually.\n\u2022 The infrared spectrum of an excited molecule\nof a metal compound has been recorded. Conventional\ntechniques require a stable molecule to produce the\nspectrum. The new method uses a pulsed laser to\nexcite the molecules then measures the absorption of\ninfra-red light of a particular frequency. The process\nis repeated stepping up the infra-red frequency so that\na spectrum can be built up. Excited molecules, such\nas chlorophyll, already exist in nature.\n\u2022 A claimed mass disc re pen cy for a spinning\ng ryo scope has recently been published. Two\nJapanese scientists postulate that a gyroscope\nspinning anti-clockwise as viewed from above has a lower mass than the same one with opposite or zero\nspin.\nThe phenomenon was still said to have occured\nafter steps were taken to cross reference the results.\nAccording to classical theory there is no mass change\nbetween gyroscopes that are stationary or spinning\nin either direction. If such a mass reduction exists a major rethink of present theory would be required.\n\u2022 A Biochemical Society lecture entitled 'T cells and\ntheir products in allergy and asthma' will take place\non Tuesday 23 January.

That truly says it all, but to incite you all (except\nphysicists) to their next gig on February 6 at the Lady\nOwen's Arms at 235 Goswell Road near the Angel\ntube, more needs to be said.\nA truly intimate and excellent gig at a venue similar\nto the average living room. Felo-de-se risked life and\nlimb to get five people onto a struct u ally unsound and\ncarpeted stage; but Nicky (lead singer) still managed\nto dance in his own special way between Stuart\n(guitarist) and Simon (bassist), when one unexpected\ntwist from either would have resulted in GBH. The\nforty five minute set of ten songs concluded with a brilliant cover of Foxy Lady; a slight attitude of cynical\nsarcasm ran throughout which made the band less\nremoved from the crowd than an ordinary gig, though\nat this venue it would be hard to get less less removed.\nIf you don't get lucky in the Psychedelic Furs\ncompetition then go to their next gig on Feb 6, this\nis no Briggin' hype.\nDEL and thanks to J.12\" Tad\nWood Goblins\nTad is big, 'Godzilla in a lumberjack shirt', and his\nsound is massive, but still his material remains elusive\nand Taddettes country wide remain closet ted. He\ncrossed the Atlantic to crash the British hardcore\nscene last year and toured with sub-pop stable mate Nirvana.\nThis record will keep all hardcore fans and Tadettes\nsatisfied until the release of the Salt-Lick mini-LP to\nbe released in Feb '90, from which Wood Goblins is\nextracted.\nFeedbacking and guitar noise fronted by a gnarling\nvoice, impress the image of evil creatures into you and\nthen carve their tale into a mountain of sound.\nThe flip-side tracks Cooking with Gas and Daisy\n'grunge' and clamber further up the sound mountain\nand complete an extremely good well mixed and Albini\nproduced 12\".\nDefinitely a must for mountain climbers\neverywhere.\nDEL.\nLP Boss Hog\nDrinkin', Lechin' & Lyin'\nThis record is the love child of Christina and\nJonathan's[ Pussy Galore) frustrations. Beaten up\nwith the help of Kurt Wolf [Pussy Galore), Jerry Teel\n[Honeymoon Killers) and Charlie Onoras.\nBefore even getting the vinyl to the turntable first\none must extract it (slowly for best effect) from the\ncover. Yes, the cover cannot pass without mention\nbut, you can squint below to make your own opinions.\nWhen finally arriving at the record one finds it\nmatches the cover better than any other could. In its\nentirety the only fair description would be to call it\nhorny, thrash rock, which leaves the final opinion to\nfall onto your interpretation of horny!\nUndeniably good but limited in its outlook.\nDEL.\n12\" Sinead\nO 'Connor\nNothing Compares to You\nComposed by Prince, music by Soul II Soul, and vocals\nby the unbelievably talented Sinead O 'Connor, a weird, yet wonderful, combination. This latest release\nby Sinead is in complete contrast to the catchy tune\nfor her most successful single Mandinka, yet still does\nnot fail to exhibit her own individual style.\nShe manages to maintain her characteristically\nattacking vocals without losing or detracting from the\noverall gentle mood. It is a very sad and meaningful\nsong and Sinead's forever changing soft and harsh\ntones describe it both beautifully and accurately. It is\ndefinitely one of her finest pieces yet, showing her\nincredible and greatly accessible talent. Hopefully this\nwill finally earn her the praise she so rightly deserves.\nJustine.\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "More hamper fun\nAntiN US Dear Dave,\nI must admit that I feel very torn in my loyalties. On\nthe one side you are a personal friend and someone\nwhom I have admired, supported and gained support\nfrom for many years. Conversely you are a heartless\nunfeeling and thoughtless bastard. The kind of person\nwho would let someone believe for almost a week that\nthey have won a Christmas hamper allowing them to\nfind out the truth on a Friday morning when they see\ntheir embarrassment printed on the pages of FELIX.\nI wish I could have advised you not to have performed\nthis hurtful prank let alone print it, but unfortunately\nI was too late. Sometimes we are misguided by our\npeers and group social pressure. For this reason I let\nsleeping dogs lie rather than make life more difficult\nfor you and those already hurt. Nevertheless last\nweek's FELIX shows you to be a heartless, unfeeling,\nthoughtless and vindictive bastard. For last week you\nturned your embarrassed a gres sion upon a hard\nworking, generous and sensitive individual, who may\nfor once have been overcome by group social\npressure, when after buying presents for those hurt\nindividuals, joined with a group in saying 'Up Yours'\nto you.\nI believe that your token gesture was inadequate\nand that Jen Hardy-Smith did you a fine service by\nimproving on it. A big man knows when he has made\na mistake and does his utmost to set things right. You\nhave done anything but apologise in fact you have\ntaken the offensive. You are responsible for FELIX and\nin my opinion you should organise payment for these\nextra gifts.\nAs a result I enclose \u00a35 as my contribution to the\nnew 'FELIX hamper fund' for my hand in FELIX of late,\nwhilst joining many others in saying UP YOURS Dave.\nSee you for collation on Thursday.\nYours,\nSydney Harbour-Bridge, ICU President 1987-88.\nPS. Before you even think of it don't become a stupid bastard next week. Nobody put me up to this,\nthere are no ulterior motives, I just felt I had to write.\nDear Dave,\nOverstepping the mark is a phrase some journalists\npay too little attention to. You have done so in regard\nto the 'Christmas Hamper Scandal'. There is an ethical\nlimit to which a newspaper can sink in order to make\na story.\nFELIX, on the whole has the reputation of being an\ninherently factual and well reported student\nnewspaper admittedly with a healthy anti-Union bias.\nConning prominent College people by pretending they\nhave won a Christmas hamper and reporting their\nreaction is however in particularly bad taste. If this\ncan be classed as a practical joke then surely it has\nbackfired. In such circumstances moderate\nunderstanding people would apologise.\nJen Hardy-Smith has helped to hold the Union\ntogether for fifteen years and is universally respected\nby all those who have worked with her. Her action\nin making some attempt to compensate those people\nwho were deceived by members of FELIX, shows her\npolitical awareness and respect for the reputation of\nour student union. Evidently something which you\nhave ignored in this case!\nI believe you have done a good job in your year as\nEditor and hope you will take the appropriate action\nin this incident.\nYours,\nPaul Skipworth, ACC Vice-Chairman 1988/89\nand Hockey Club Captain.\nAfter the Union Finance Committee meeting on\nTuesday evening, it appears that the FELIX staff\nfund will not be called upon for the cost of the\nhamper and other gifts. I should therefore like to\napologise to Jen Hardy-Smith for suggesting that\nshe had hatched a plot against FELIX. As a gesture of my regret, I have now sent her a \u00a335\n'fizzy' hamper. May I suggest we attempt to gain\na bulk discount next time?\nI am returning your five pound note forthwith-an anonymous benefactor has paid for the gift.\nDear Dave,\nYet again we may have found further proof that\nimperial is the capital of Apathy. Are the students at\nImperial so rich that they can afford to give away\n\u00a325,000 without bothering to find out whose pockets\nit will be lining?\nLast Thursday saw the first of the Anti-NUS Society\nmeetings, meetings which are not just open to\nstudents who have shown an initial interest in this\nnew society, but are also open for discussion on how\nthe NUS operates, and on how we believe student life\nwill be affected by re affiliation to this august body.\nThe only 'services or benefits' that the NUS offer\nImperial's students over and above what our own\nefficient and democratic Union do, are the NUS's own\nmoral and political judgements on issues which have\nvery little relevance to student life-i.e. they play God\nto aga oled congregation. For instance do you believe\nthat abortion should be allowed right up until the\nmoment of birth, such that this termination of life may\nbe carried out by any boyd medically or non-medically\nqualified, including the mother herself-as a member\nof the NUS you would officially believe this.\nDo you realise that \u00a325,000 of your money which\nis presently spent on YOUR societies will be lost, and\nspent on the furthering of similar moral and political\nissues which have very little relevance to student life.\nSurely throwing \u00a325,000 away and not bothering to\nfind out where it has been thrown makes Imperial\nCapital of Apathy.\nJonath D Griffiths,\nChairman Anti-National Union of Students.\nJudo what? Dear Sir,\nIn today's edition of FELIX (12th Jan) you printed\nan article under the heading 'Judo black belts' relating\nto the recent successes of the IC Judo Club, which\nwas accompanied by a photo of the IC Karate Club\ndemonstration at the Freshers' Fair.

    "content": "Boots for the Footless\nFollowing in the tradition of his literary brothers\nBrendan and Dominic, Brian Behan has turned his hand\nto playwriting. This, his debut stage play, was\nspecially commissioned by the Tricycle Theatre in\n1986.\nPadser Sosage sits happily in Dublin with his \u00a35000\nand breakfast in bed. His sister-in-law, Maura, waits\non him in the hope that she will be rewarded by some\nof his inheritance from his mother. This idyllic way of\nlife is interrupted when he flirts with a girl Maura has\ntaken in, who does the cleaning. She threatens to kill\nthem both if he does not marry her so he flees the\ncountry.\nLar and Martin, Maura and Declan's sons are both\nrevolutionaries but in different ways. Lar advocates\npeaceful solidarity while Martin supports the militant\nnationalism of the IRA which eventually gets him into\ntrouble. The play is actually set in 1950-51 but it could\nbe at any time in recent Irish history.\nThe plot may not be the best but in a play like this\nthe plot is merely a device in order that Behan can\nexpress his views through the characters. Behan is\nvery sure of what he is against-militant nationalism,\nthe hypocritical attitude of many Irish people to their\nreligion, etc-but not so sure of what he is actually\nfor. The only clue we get to this is Padser's comment\nthat all he wants is enough to eat and drink and for\neverybody to live in harmony with each other; he\ncannot understand Lar and Martin's high ideals.\nThe language of the Irish characters is after Synges\ntradition of hiberno-English but liberally sprinkled with\nvulgar expletives. The humour mainly consists of one\nliners, although th re re is a little situation comedy and\nmany of the songs are funny. This is not a play you\nThe Pelican\nA daughter returns from her honeymoon early. Her\nfather has recently died, without apparently leaving\na will. The recriminations that ensue force all members\nof the family to reassess their relationships, especially\nwith the mother, and to gradually awaken from the\nsleep in which we all live.\nSo, standard fare for this play by August Strindberg,\ntranslated from the Swedish by Gregory Motton. Mr\nMotton has tried 'to preserve the rhythm, style and\npeculiarities'. Not being fluent in Swedish, I can't vouch for this, but the play's dialogue does have a distinct feel to it.\nThe words themselves are strongly delivered by a good cast. Emma Hewitt, as Gerda, does a particularly\nfine job of portraying a girl who has remained in an\nalmost child-like state, to avoid having to\nacknowledge what is going on around her. The scene\nwhere she and Fredrik (Ian Jeffs) finally awake, with\nthe help of a letter from their father is extremely\nharrowing.\nIn fact, the whole play is very harrowing. Set in one\nroom of a house, the smallness of the theatre suits\nthe claus tra phobic nature of the play beautifully. The\ndetail on the set itself is good, right down to an\nun faded patch of wallpaper left, when a painting is\nremoved.\nThere are one or two nice little 'special effects' too,\nsuch as a rocking chair in 'the wind'.\nOn the negative side though, despite some genuine\nironic humour, there is a fair amount of moments\nwhich are unintentionally funny-including a death!\nPage 4\nwould take the children to, mainly because of the\nlanguage but the humour is a little crude at times as\nwell.\nBehan uses the play to comment on some of the\nparadoxes of Irish life. For instance Martin is very\nenthusiastic about his religion and yet he condones\nviolence to achieve his ideas. Declan sums up the\nRoman Catholic Church's attitude to marriage when\nhe remarks 'All religion ever gave me was all kids and\nno sex when all I wanted was all sex and no kids!'.\nBilly Boyle gives a marvellous performance as\nPadser, a lovable lay about who never does any work\nunless he absolutely has to. Walter McMonagle also\ngives a good performance as Declan although he does\nnot have much scope. He shows his versatility when\nby a change of posture and of accent he is\ntransformed from a working-class Dublin man to an\nupper-class Englishman, the King.\nThe play is marred by a rather weak ending, only\nsaved from totally spoiling the play by the\nperformance of Billy Boyle. Behan never fails to bring\nthe humour out of a situation but he still manages to\ntreat some aspects with compassion and good insight\ninto human life.\nBoots for the Footless never pretends to be totally\nreal life but nevertheless manages to be convincing.\nIt may not be a great literary masterpiece but it is a fine representation of the Irish way of life and is\ndefinitely worth a visit.\nBoots for the Footless is on at the Tricycle Theatre,\n269 Kilburn High Road, NW6. It runs from Mondays\nto Saturdays, tickets cost from \u00a34.50. Box office\n01-328 1000 for information on concessions.\nJay.\nAlso, it tends to degenerate into shouting and\nscreaming towards the end of some of the longer and\nheavier scenes.\nIf emotional drama is up your street, don't miss it-otherwise think twice.\nThe Pelican is playing at the Gate Theatre Club until\nFebruary 17. The theatre can be found above the\nPrince Albert Pub, 11 Pembridge Road, Notting Hill.\nThe nearest tube is Notting Hill Gate and a student\nticket will cost \u00a33, membership cost \u00a31 quarterly or\n\u00a32.50 annually.\nAdam T.A Dry White\nSeason\nRacism and justice are irreconcilable; but when a society declines into overt bigotry how does it\ncontinue its claim to moral righteousness? A Dry\nWhite Season studies this problem through the\nrelationship between a white family and a black one.\nBen du Toit (Donald Sutherland) is a white school\nteacher who lives a comfortable life in the suburbs of\nJohannesburg. He believes in the principles of justice,\nbut having been insulated from reality, he has never\nhad to choose between these and the continuance of\nhis serene existence. In this respect, he differs very\nlittle from his modern European counterpart. Gordon\nNgubene (Winston Ntshona) is Ben's gardener. He is\nalso honest and law-abiding, and has no greater\nambition than to continue his life as before. But\nthrough the beating of his son by the police, and his\neventual murder in detention, he is dragged into the\nconflict which is South Africa. Ben is at first sceptical\nof his claims, but through his respect for Gorden he\nendeavours to discover more.\nThere are two features which make this film special\nfor me. The first is the stunning realism with which\nit shows strength of the black people against terrible\nadversity. In the filming of the demonstration scenes\nin Zimbabwe, two thousand students, many exiles of\nSouth Africa were given three days leave to\nparticipate. The second is its study of the break down\nof the du Toit family under the realisation of the lie\non which they have been living. On one side the\ntriumph of justice and equality, and on the other the\nbearing of naked racism and greed.\nThe acting is of a high standard, but several\nperformances are particularly noteworthy. Janet\nSuzman's role as Ben's wife is beautifully\nunderplayed, and it is this plainness which makes her\npart so believable. Her South African background has\nsurely helped her in this domain, Zakes Mokae, also\nfrom South Africa, gives an excellent performance as\nBen's guide.

    "content": "Careers service axed?\nThe Careers Advisory Service (CAS) at\nImperial College is under attack from\nspending cuts. The college is expected to\nremove the Information Officer, also\nknown as the careers librarian, as of the\nend of this term after the post was\nabolished last Thursday.\nRuss Clark, Head of the college careers\nservice claimed that this would mean that\n'We would seriously consider closing the\nservice - we can't consider running with\none person'. The Rector, Sir Eric Ash\njustified the decision by saying that 'The\nuniversity system has gone through a financial squeeze - Imperial College has\nhad it's spending dramatically squeezed\nbecause it was seen as over funded and\nover-resourced'.\nunderstand, and that the job was not a purely administrative one. 'Most students\nare not as confident as they would appear\nto be', she added. 'They need somebody\nwho's credible'.\nIC's Management Planning Group\n(MPG) on which the Rector, Pro-Rector,\nManaging Director and the four Deans of\nthe constituent college unions sit, hopes\nto staff the careers office with postgraduate\nstudents, as they do in the USA. 'The\nAmerican system hasn'ta patch on ours'\nclaimed the staff. T think that the idea of\na moveable group of students running the\noffice would be hopeless - they could stack\nshelves only and need constant\nsupervision', said Shiona Llewellyn,\n'much time is spent in showing students\nfor Technical Experience (IAESTE) which\ngives students the opportunity to go abroad\nand do technical work. They claimed that\nthis would be particularly important in\n1992 when the European Community\nbecomes closer. With the post frozen,\nappointments must remain part-time with\na possible review.\nThe CAS added that in both jobs,\ncomplex judgements had to be made. If\nthere was no such service, the nearest\navailable one would be the Gordon square\nlibrary, serving the University of London.\nThey claimed that this was too far away\nto be of immediate practical use to IC\nstudents.\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, answered on\nthe question of confidentiality saying that\nThe college careers service has\nundergone a series of cuts in recent years;\nit had it's budget cut by \u00a310,000 two years\nago and has already lost its assistant\ninformation officer. Shiona Llewellyn, the\ncareers advisor and Mr Clark do not spend\nall the working week at IC CAS, and there\nare two other members of staff who are\npaid for by private companies. Frances\nMcEwen, the present Information Officer\nis working on a temporary basis. She said\nthat 'If you remove the post it reduces the\nability of the service to provide the range\nand depth of information that both\nundergraduates and postgraduates\nrequire\u2014it wil reduce our ability to cope\nwith individual enquiries.' No other\nUniversity in the country lacks an\nInformation Officer for its CAS, only the\nsmaller Institutes of Higher Education can\ndo without.\nShiona Llewellyn claimed that the\nInformation officer dealt with 'literally\ntons of literature' including regularly\nupdated videos, brochures and company\nnewsletters. She said that the decision to\nlose the librarian was taken by an\nadministrator about job he didn't how to use information - it is a job\nrequiring motivation and experience ...the\nRector is convinced that all students are\nsought after by all employers, that we\nalmost don't need the careers service. The\nproblem is that they (the students) don't always know what they want'.\nRuss Clark said that they had an ethical\nobligation to keep the office open both for\nstudents and the private companies who\npay IC for the facility. IC makes an ett profit of \u00a313,000 from these companies\neach year. It was claimed that on busy\ndays anywhere between 100 and 200\nstudents would use the library and other\nfacilities in the careers office. With the\npossible closure of the Careers Library the\nCollege may be forced to break these\ncontracts with employers. Mr Clark now\nfears for the confidentiality of students\napplication forms. With PG students\ntaking the place of the Information Officer\nhe feels the position of trust the CAS holds\nmay be lost.\nThe College has now frozen the post of\nthe Vacation Training Co-or d in at or, who\nis responsible for the International\nAssociation for the Exchange of Students\nT have no reason to distrust students'. He\nsaid that IC has lost about 2-3 % of its\nfunding per year, and that cuts must occur\nin all places. 'These cuts are never\ncomfortable - cuts imposed on the CAS\nare not painless. We are not cutting out\nfat, but substance,' he added.\nHe said that there was no problem with\njob finding at IC, 'We don't have a desperate need to find jobs for obscure\ndepartments'. He added that it was not as\nif the CAS was 'the only port of call - there\nare the departmental advisory services.'\nWhen challenged that the CAS may have\nto close at times he said students must 'just\ncome when it is open - like a doctor's surgery'.\nHe asked the staff in the CAS to\n'approach this in an open minded way',\n'It's terribly easy to find all sorts of\nreasons why it can't possibly be done\nwhen it hasn't been tried before.' He\ncriticised the CAS claim that the MPG cut\nthe job because 'it was just an\nadministrative job' as 'a caricature'.\nSir Ash admitted that the service would\nbecome slightly worse.

    "content": "FeliX The Careers Centre\nI first visited the careers centre a year ago. At the time\nI was disappointed. A lot of the information I wanted\ndid not seem to be there and the place seemed to be\na mess.\nThe centre has changed a lot since then. After a \u00a3 15 000 refit and a lot of work on the part of the staff,\nthe careers library is now a useful resource. It may,\nhowever, be forced to close because of a23% cut\nacross the board within the college. This seems\nstrange, since the removal of the Information Officer\nrepresents just about all the centre has left to lose.\nSuddenly a2% cut becomes a100% cut.\nThe whole idea of removing the post of Information\nOfficer is to save money. Why is it, then, that the loss\nof this post will almost certainly mean the loss of\n\u00a313,000 worth of p' of it from contracts with outside\ncompanies? Why does the college want to remove a post which indirectly and directly generates so much\nmoney when the salary involved is only \u00a310,000 per\nannum at present? I had hoped that the Rector would\nbe able to answer these questions. Instead he made\nsome vague mumbling s about being able to trust\nPostgraduate students to do the work. I spent 2 hours\nin the Careers centre on Tuesday and I realised then\nthat the job cannot be filled in this way. The Rector\nshould do likewise and realise his folly.\nWhat worried me most about the attitude of the\nRector was his belief that departmental careers\nservices could fulfil the part of the main college\ncareers advisory service. Anyone who has been at IC\nlong enough will know that there is a great deal of\npressure within departments for graduates to continue\ninto a degree related career. To remove a service\nwhich provides an independent outlook from this is\nto remove freedom of choice.\nIf Sir Ash wishes to send more IC graduates into\ndegree related areas he should examine the cause and\nnot the effect. People at IC leave their subject because\nof a disenchantment which seems to pervade every\ncourse in this college along with a stifling of\nindependent, creative thought. If Sir Ash wishes to\nsmother this major failing by forcing people into\ncareers they are not finally suited to he is doing the\nright thing. The most successful of IC's present\nresearchers are not graduates from IC but graduates\nwho have come here from more free thinking\nestablishments.\nI believe that the cuts on the Careers Advisory\nService are not only wasteful but ill thought-out and\nseriously damaging to IC's future as an establishment\nwith a good deal of scope for improvement. If you use\nor have used the service and agree with me, I would\nurge you to write to the Rector and complain. I don't like the idea of an independent service being stamped\non in this manner. Who will be next?\nPeter Hallworth\nWe have an interesting story to investigate at present.\nIt concerns Montpelier Hall, a lot of water and some\nwork performed by contractors, which has proved to\nbe unsatisfactory. By that, I mean that it has left parts\nof the hall looking like disaster areas.\nWe rang Peter Hallworth, who is responsible for this\narea, for a comment. Mr Hallworth's secretary stalled\nus and then came up with the standard 'He's in a meeting.' Mr Hallworth must have more meetings\nthan I smoke cigarettes in a day. He has finally agreed\nto meet us on January 30th.I am not sure of the year\nyet, but I guess that will depend on a meeting to\ndiscuss when we should have a meeting. The question\nnow is, who is the buck going to be passed to? Amidst\nmuch shouting of the name 'Jo Dynes' (the standard\nscapegoat) Mr Hallworth will probably tell us that the\nmatter is really not that serious.\nMaybe he will be forced to wait until a ceiling\ncollapses before he decides to take action, as he did\nin a previous incident in Montpelier. Until we speak\nto him, I suggest that everybody in Montpelier\npu chases a hard hat and an umbrella. Look on the\nbright side: if you wait long enough you may all have\na shower in your room. Until then I shall be searching\nfor a copy of a nursery rhyme book for Mr Hallworth.\n'There was a crooked man, who had a crooked\nhouse...'\nCredits\nThanks very much to: Steve Meyfroidt for giving me\nand Andy a nightmare; Simon Haslam for the science\npage; DEL, Justine and Chris Leahy for music; Paul\nShanley for del at or; Adam Harrington for news; Liz\nWarren for Paris feature; Chris Stapleton, Jeremy\nBurnell and Roland Flowerdew for p hot graph y; Toby\nJones, Ian Hodge, Adam Tinworth and Jo Wright for\nreviews; Ents, Jackie Scott, Sydney Harbour-Bridge,\nRoy Francis, Ian Hodge, Jim Lucy and Adam\nHarrington for collating; Andy Bannister and Pippa\nSalmon for help and advice; Rose and Andy for making\nthe tea; Jelly for laughs.\nFELIX is published by the editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union\nPublications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit,\nPrince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB( Tel. 01-589 5111 ext 35151.\nEditor: Dave Smedley.

    "content": "Demon Lord of Karandal Gland Motel\nThe people reading this review can be split very neatly\ninto two groups. Firstly there are those that know the\naut hour and his writings, and secondly there are those\nthat have strayed onto this page and are looking for\nsomething to read.\nTo the first group, you can skip the next paragraph,\nwhile the second should read it with care.\nThis is the third book, of the second series by David\nEddings, the first of which, The Belgariad, has\nreceived much critical acclaim and perhaps more\nimportantly, has made the aut hour very popular. The\nstyle of the books is fantasy adventure, set in an alien\nland far removed from normal life. Unlike many books\nof this type they do not depend on the weird and\nfanatical creatures and places for interest as they are\nall very good stories in their own right. The story line\nis fairly simple, the evil powers in the world have\nkidnapped Garion's baby, and he being a normal loving\nfather is a bit put out by this. So setting out, sword\nin hand, with an amazing assortment of friends and\nfamily his only aim in life is to recover his young son.\nThe book is fairly well written, as all the others have\nbeen, and the four hundred pages drift by quite\npainlessly with very little appearing to happen yet still\nmanaging to keep your interest throughout. As this\nis in the third book of the second series there is little,\nif any character development as it is assumed that you\nknow the various characters by this stage quite well.\nIt is possible to ascertain a reasonable idea of their\ncharacters from their actions which allowed me to\nenjoy the book despite the fact that the last one I read\nfrom the series was perhaps six months ago.\nOne small word of warning for those thinking of\nstarting on the series, the names used are sometimes\nweird, many seem like a random selection of letters\nthat are only just pronounceable. Such names as\n'Kakath' and 'Urvon' are not the kind of names you\nwill find in your local 'phone book.\nOverall I can very strongly recommend this, and all\nthe other seven books in the two series as books that\nare well worth the time to read.\nIan Hodge.\nWhen the leader of the Bloolips, Betty Bourne is\napparently killed, vanishing in a cloud of chiffon, not\nlong after they were kicked out of a New York\nboarding house, they don't take it lying down. The\nfour remaining drag artists, with the help of the\nalcoholic Madame Blavutski (who bears an uncanny\nresemblance to Betty) follow her to the astral plane,\nand the Murphers Motel. There, strange things are\ngoing on.\nThis little affair is in no way your run of the mill\nLondon theatre. Along with, by their own admission,\n'ludicrously thin storyline' is a strange mix of dance\nroutines, social satire and more conventional comedy.\nThe targets range from Broadway musicals to Section\n28\u2014appropriately enough.\nThe whole production obstinately refuses to take\nitself seriously. Comments about their own acting, the\nlaughable stage effects (a small puff of dry ice) and\nthe curious familiarity of the piano that is always\nwhere they are.\nThe sets themselves are minimal-apart from the\npiano, and a black projection to indicate when they\nare in the motel, all the props are carried on and off\nthe set by the cast. At the slightest provocation they\nwill rush off stage and change into one of the vast\narray of outrageous frocks that they wear during the\nplay.\nQuite where to place this is a puzzle. It has elements\nof theatre, cabaret and musicals. What it also has is\nan incredibly infectious sense of humour that makes\nit one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time.\nAnything which can turn the ironing into a great\ndramatic moment must be worth a visit.\nGland Motel is at the Drill Hall Arts Centre, 16\nChenies Street, WC1 until February 3. Concessionary\ntickets will leave your pocket \u00a34 lighter. Nearest tube\nis Goodge Street.\nAdam T. Black Rain\n'Hi, what was the film like?'...'Great! Two hours of\nmindless violence!'\nYes, but we expected that. After all, it's got Michael\nDouglas as tough New York City cop Nick Conklin\nwith sidekick Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia).\nIn a quiet Manhattan restaurant they witness a brutal murder during a meeting of the Mafia and the\nYakuza. They act. Now they must transport Sato\n(Yusaku Matsuda), the captured killer, back to Osaka,\nJapan.\nAll goes well until Nick signs Sato over to his own\nmen at the airport! The authorities aren't too pleased,\nso Nick and Charlie are teamed up with Japanese\ndetective Masahiro Matsumoto (Ken Takakura) to\nrecapture him.\nThe trail leads the trio into the city's underworld,\nwhere rival Yakuza crime factions battle for\nsupremacy. As Nick and Charlie try to orientate\nthemselves to this new and dangerous world, they\nfind themselves being sucked into the gang warfare\non the street. When Charlie is murdered in front of\nhim, Nick goes after the big guns.\nThe Japanese police force is portrayed as an\nintegrated whole, where the system is all. It doesn't work well with Nick however, as he plays by his own\nrules. So in true American style, it's the lone\ngunfighter, with the aid of the sacked Masahiro, who\nfinally brings Sato to justice.\nUnderworld Osaka has a distinct feel of Blade\nRunner about it, even though Black Rain is set in\nmodern times. It's not surprising as Black Rain was\ndirected by Ridley Scott [Blade Runner, Alien). Outside\nthe city, however, it's the Japanese landscape that\ndom in tes. Black Rain combines American and Japanese\ntalents to good effect. Ken Takakura (or 'Ken-san' as\nhe is known to his fans) is Japan's leading motion\npicture star, appearing in nearly two hundred films,\nmany with international acting awards. As Masahiro,\nhe gives us an insight into the Japanese view of\nAmericans that is fascinating. Other leading Japanese\nactors in the film include Tomisaburo Wakayama and\nMiyuki Ono.\nMichael Douglas plays a strong character who\nencounters an alien culture and survives. His\nexploration of the disregard for Japanese culture make\ncompulsive viewing.\nOh, by the way, it's not a gory film but there are\nsome violent scenes. This is definitely a mainstream\nthriller not to be missed.\nToby Jones.\n\n"

Spring offers the best balance of cost and reasonable\nweather and, of course, the most romantic atmosphere! Liz Warren reports.\nParis in the\nWe flew from Gatwick to Paris on Friday by Air\nEurope. The flight is so short that no sooner had we\ngained height than we were being brought down\nagain: a thoroughly painful process for the ears. The\nstewardesses rushed to serve breakfast (although it\ncould be lunch or dinner, it's hard to tell from the food)\nand we tucked in as the English coastline dropped\naway beneath us.\nOnce landed and through customs-we wisely took\nonly hand luggage and avoided waiting for baggage\nto be unloaded-we took the RER to the centre of\nParis. The RER is a little like Network South East in\nLondon, while the Metro is more like the Underground.\nWe emerged blinking into Les Halles, a huge shopping\ncentre, on four floors, in the middle of Paris, and\ndecided that if this was what we'd wanted we could\nhave saved the fare and gone to Oxford Street. We\ndodged the furious shoppers and walked down to the\nSeine and over the He de la Cite, getting our first sight\nof the magnificent facade of Notre Dame. Tired by the\njourney, we flopped into chairs in a cafe on the South\nBank and drank the first of many cafes-au-lait and\nchocolat s. Refreshed, we went back to the He de la Cite and\nlooked around the cathedral. The square in front of\nit is always inhabited by small packs of children\nbegging for money, proving that Paris, however\nbeautiful, is like any other big city, with poverty\nexisting in the shadow of its finest monuments. Inside\nNotre Dame the sunlight flooded through the\nmagnificent rose window and the air was thick and\nshadowy, permeated with the smell of the hundreds\nof little candles (2F,5F and 10F according to your\ndegree of devotion) burning at all the side altars.\nWe had booked no accommodation and, realising\nthat it was three o 'clock, we decided to find\nsomewhere. Aided by 'The Rough Guide to Paris', an\ninvaluable guide to anyone trying to exist on a limited\nbudget, we wandered through the left bank.\nUnfortunately the hotels were either full or more\nexpensive than we had bargained for. Realising that\nwe could spend all day wandering in vain, we plucked\nup courage, bought a phone card and were delighted\n(not to say amazed) when my rusty ' 0 ' level French\nsecured us a double room in a hotel in Montmartre for\n100F( about \u00a310) a night.\nThe hotel proved to be one of the best things about\nour stay in Paris. Although we were on the sixth floor\nand the bed seemed to have recently played host to\na couple of elephants, it was scrupulously clean and,\nstepping out onto our private tiny balcony perched\nbetween the slates we had a perfect view of the\nsurreal white domes of Sacre Coeur floating in the blue\nsky above us.\nRefreshed, we set off for Beauborg or, as it is more\ncommonly known in Britain, the Georges Pompidou\ncentre. Housing the national collection of modern art,\nthis is one of the most controversial buildings in Paris,\nwith its 'inside out' architecture and external glass\ntube escalator. One of the architects responsible for\nthis is Richard Rogers, who designed the equally\ncontroversial Lloyds building in London. Inside there\nare excellent occasional exhibitions as well as the\npermanent collections and the postcard and art\nbookshop, which are as good as anything else in Paris.\nAfter dinner, we went up the hill from our hotel to\nthe steps in front of Sacre Coeur. This is torn between\nbeing painfully vulgar by day and startlingly unearthly\nPage 8\nat night. Paris was spread below our feet, its lights\nglowing in a peculiar velvety blackness.\nOn Saturday morning we visited Sacre Coeur again.\nOn the steps outside, exclusively black traders spread\nout their traditional arrays of bangles, beads and\nhandbags. Haggling is the essence of the game and\nan amusing half hour can be had arguing over the price\nof something which you do not really want. Inside the\nbasilica, the incense and smell of candles is even more\noverpowering than in Notre Dame and the\ncomparative blackness after the sun outside makes\nit difficult to make out much beyond the glow of the\ncandles.\nBehind Sacre Coeur lies the Place du Tertre, the\ncentre of Montmartre's tourist industry. Completely\nfake, street artists will sketch your profile, while\noverpriced cafes tout for the custom of fatigued\nAmerican matrons. Between these two extremes of\nvulgarity lies the Church of St Pierre, the elegant\nremains of a Benedictine monastery which\nincorporates four columns from a Roman shrine to\nMercury that once stood on the hill.\nAfter lunch we went down to the Left Bank, trying\nto avoid the overpriced cafes and souvenir shops.\nTraditionally the haunt of the radicals and the artists,\nit is known as the Quartier Latin, from the language\nspoken by the University students and teachers right\nup until the Revolution. Rue de la Huchette has\ndescended to rows of indifferent Greek restaurants,\nbut still boasts the theatre showing lone s co's la Cantatrice Chauve', twenty-five years after it\nopened and created the Theatre of the Absurd. Round\nhere is also the narrowest street in Paris, the Rue du\nChat qui Peche: about two feet wide, this is\nvertiginous ly evocative of what Mediaeval Paris must\nhave been like.\nWandering down the main street, the Boulevard St\nMichel, we passed the charming Hotel de Cluny, a sixteenth century mansion resembling an Oxford\nCollege, built as a Paris base for the rich abbots of\nCluny. Its gardens house the remains of the Roman\nwall to the city and are a shady retreat from the hustle\nof the road in which it incongruously sits. Just behind\nthe main road lie the imposing portals of the Sorbonne\nUniversity which helped create some of the reputation\nof this turbulent and infamous area.\nThe whole of the Quartier Latin is filled with cafes\nand bars which trade on their associations with the\nwriters and artists who used to drink and eat there,\nalthough many of them are now expensive rip-offs for\ntourists seeking the 'authentic' atmosphere. A little\nfurther south are the Luxembourg Gardens which\nprove that the French have little flair for landscape\ngardening. Sorry grass lies between endless gravel\npaths and even the fountains seem to sparkle\nun enthusiastically. On Sunday morning we took breakfast on the\nterrace of a cafe on the Place des Abbesses near our\nhotel. Even on Sunday the streets are busy with\npeople returning from the bakers with their fresh\nbaguettes and croissants. The Metro station at\nAbbesses still has one of the original complete\nGuimard entrances: green paint, a glass porch and the\nbizarre orange glass lamps. The Place is also still\ncobbled and has a relaxed and timeless feel.\nLater we walked down the Champs Elysees to the\nArc de Triomphe, where the eternal flame burns and\nFrance has its tomb to the Unknown Soldier. Crossing\nthe roundabout to the centre is a death defying\nexperience even on a Sunday as the cars swing in and\nout of the twelve roads that meet at this huge\nroundabout. From there we walked through the smart\nbourgeois suburbs to the west, to the Bois de\nBoulogne. The Bois is supposedly modelled on Hyde\nPark, but seems a lot wilder and quieter.\nAfter this we tried to visit the Louvre, but it was\nclosed while the controversial glass pyramid covering\nthe new underground entrance was being\nconstructed. Unfortunately we were going to miss the\nopening by one day. The pyramid itself is very\nbeautiful, but not, I felt, when set in the middle of the\nsweeping lines of the Louvre palace.\n\n"

In reality, this is very far from the truth.\nBetween its launch in July 1988, and its untimely\ndemise,just short of the tiny Martian moon, in the\nfollowing January, the spacecraft managed to\ncomplete a substantial fraction of its intended studies.\nIn fact, much can be learnt about Phobos from the\nlarge number of pictures taken by the spacecraft as\nit manoeuvre d towards this moon.\nBritish scientists became involved in the Phobos\nmission as a result of an agreement drawn up between\nthe British National Space Centre and the Space\nResearch Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences\nand signed by the Prime Minister during her Moscow\nvisit in 1987. Three scientists were appointed to the\nproject science team with interests in solar-planetary\nrelations (Professor David Southwood at IC), planetary\nsurface imaging (Dr John Guest of UCL) and active\nprobing of the Phobos surface (Professor Grenville\nTurner at Manchester). Of the three, only Professor\nTurner has been completely disappointed.\nThe Imperial College interest is centred on the outer\nionized atmosphere of Mars; the Space and\nAtmospheric Physics group is involved in a variety of\npast and upcoming planetary space missions and the\nSoviet invitation to join in their Martian exploration\nfitted well with the group's overall programme of work\nin space plasma physics.\nBefore January 1989 more was known about the\nupper atmosphere of the distant planet Uranus than\nwas known about that of our neighbouring planet\nMars. The Phobos spacecraft has radically changed\nthis by providing the first properly instrumented orbital\nsurveys, and very curious it turns out to be. Not a great deal was known about the ionized atmosphere\nof Mars because of a series of mishaps with both\nSoviet and US missions in the early seventies. The\nsuccessful US Viking orbiter and lander mission in\n1976 carried only very crude instrumentation on the\nentry vehicle and could determine little.\nIt left unanswered such critical questions as\nwhether or not the planet has an internal magnetic\nfield. The Earth's field creates a cavity within the solar\nwind a stream of charged particles which\ncontinuously flows from the Sun. This results in direct\naccess for solar particles to the atmosphere for a limited range of latitudes near the poles. On Earth this\nentry displays itself as the Aurora Borealis 'The\nNorthern Lights'.\nNo magneto meter was carried in orbit or taken to\nthe planet surface by Viking. The presence of an\ninternally generated magnetic field is, of course, a question of fundamental interest to all pi let ary scientists, not just the space plasma physicists.\nControversies over the presence or absence of an\nintrinsic planetary magnetic field have raged\nunchecked by the sobering presence of actual data\nfor two decades.\nThe first three Martian orbits by Phobos were highly\nelliptical, with a closest approach of 850km. It was\nhoped that such a close approach would be sufficient\nto detect the presence of any planetary internal dipole\nfield. Subsequent analysis of gathered data indicated\nthat Mars is unlikely to have such a magnetic field.\nThe most dramatic results from the mission are\nprobably the analyses of out flowing ions on the\nImage of the Martian moon, Phobos, obtained by the Soviet PHOBOS\nspacecraft. The object, which is likely to be originally from the asteroid\nbelt, is irregularly shaped (technically known as potato-like) and cratered.\nPicture courtesy of Space Research Institute of Academy of Sciences of\nUSSR.\nnight side of the planet. During the 26 circular (Phobos\nrendezvous) orbits at an altitude of about 6000km beams of ions which appear to be 0 +\nwere detected\nflowing away from the planet. Similar flow rates are\ninfact found leaving the earth above the aurora l zones\nbut what is remarkable in their discovery at Mars is\nthe potential effect on the much more tenuous\nMartian atmosphere. Over the planet's surface a loss\nrate from the planet of the order of 2kg per second\nhas been estimated, This is sufficient to remove the\natmosphere in 100 million years, a long time, maybe,\nbut short compared to the life of the solar system of\n4.5 billion years.\nThe results have created great interest at Imperial\nwhere, with a substantial amount of luck, work was\nalready well in hand in setting up a computer model\nthat looks capable of explaining the distributions of\nmaterial observed moving away from the planet. The\nmodel had been set up to model the extended\ncometary plasma environment encountered at Comet\nHalley by the Giotto probe and at Giacobini-Zinner by\nthe NASA-ESA International Cometary Explorer\nspacecraft. Ironically, because of the extended nature\nof the environment, turbulence appears far more\nimportant in the comet environment than it is at Mars\nwhere scattering by turbulence does not seem to\ndisrupt the underlying process.\nOrbit calculations and simple kinematic calculations\nshow that the heavier planetary ionized material ends\nup behind the planet (on the night side) moving out\naway from the Sun and the planet just as the Phobos\ninstruments detected. At the time of writing it is still\nearly days; rather complex detailed signatures are\nseen in the data and much comparison of data and\ntheory is needed to see if the system is understood\nbut the preliminary betting at Imperial is that the planet\nis indeed un magnetised. If our first ideas are borne out, no other planet has\nan interaction quite like the Mars solar interaction.\nHowever, as we conclude that Mars, like Venus, has\nno internal magnetic field, it means that of the three\nterrestrial planets, Earth, Mars and Venus, in respect\nof internal magnetism, it is Earth that is the odd one\nout.\nMars and its moons remain the highest priority for\nthe Soviet space programme. An orbiting survey\nmission, Mars 94, will be launched in 1994. The moon\nPhobos remains a scientific target of immense\ninterest; it seems to be a captured asteroid and likely\nto be made of pristine primitive material processed\nlittle since the formation of the solar system. In 1996,\nthe latest plan schedules a probe to be launched to\nrendezvous with Phobos to return samples of Phobos\nsoil to Earth orbit as a prelude to the eventual return\nof Martian material to Earth, early in the next century.\nThe involvement with the Soviet space programme\nhas come at a very exciting time in Soviet history; it\nhas been possible on each trip to Moscow to see the\nchanges resulting from Glasnost. The public\ndiscussion of the inadequacies and management\nfailures that allowed the failure of the Phobos\nspacecraft are part of the relentless questioning of the\nsystem that has been opened up by the new spirit.\n, In fact, Space Science has led the way in opening up\naccess and collaboration with foreign scientists; the\nPhobos mission involves scientists from more than a dozen countries. The Soviet planetary programme is\nto continue with a large foreign involvement and the\nBritish are very welcome to become more deeply\ninvolved in what is very much an international\nendeavour,albeit Soviet-led.\nProfessor David Southwood, Imperial College.\nPage 7\n\n"
