Jean\nPierre Jeunet is probably the most eminent\ndirector in France and so I jumped at\nthe chance to interview him. This opportunity eventually manifested into a\ngroup interview but as I seated myself\nwith around ten other journalists I still\ncould not hide my excitement of finally\nmeeting the great man in person.\nJeunet enters the room with a laid-back attitude and the tension in the\nroom soon dissipates. He quips a joke\nabout Japanese hospitality and my apprehensions about the language barrier disappear. He is dressed casually and leans comfortably into the sofa\nwith an almost mischievous glint in his\neye. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d he\ngently inquires.\nStar Crossed Lovers\nA reporter across quickly asks about\nJeunet\u2019s writing partnership. At the\nstart of his career Marc Caro, whom\nhe met at a film festival, was the other mind behind Delicatessen and The\nCity of Lost Children and recently Guillaume Laurent has been his collaborator on Amelie, A Very Long Engagement and his upcoming film Micmacs.\n\u201cIt is important (to have a co-writer)\nbecause it\u2019s like ping pong. You have to\nfind the right partner\u201d, he explains, \u201cIt\nis exactly like in life, once you find your\nlover it is very important to keep him\nor her. Guillaume is my perfect partner\nand at the end I could not tell if it was\nmy idea or his.\u201d\nJeunet elaborates that the original\nconcept belongs to him as it is his\nfilm. For Micmacs he wanted to mix\nhis feelings about weapon sellers with\nreferences to Snow White and the\nSeven Dwarves and overall theme of\nrevenge to drive the plot. Sergio Leone\u2019s Once Upon a Time in the West is a\nmajor influence on Micmacs. They fill\nan \u2018idea box\u2019 with notes on characters,\nincidents and plot mechanisms and\nonce the box is full they begin to write.\n\u201cI love the concept of Pixar or Disney movies to have one idea per shot.\nWhen we write, we write the dialogue\nscenes and the visual scenes and then\nput the film together.\u201d\nLost in translation?\nIronically Jeunet has to consult his\ntranslator to understand the next\nquestion which is about the loss of\nmeaning when the French script is\ntranslated into foreign subtitles. Laurent likes to play with his own language and when he chooses to shoot\nin French he realises he limits the\naudiences around the world. \u201cIn this\nfilm we play with old French expressions but at Toronto the audience\nwere laughing so the subtitles were\npretty good. We have to find the right\nbalance\u201d\nMonster bash\nThe same reporter asks why there is a\nrecurring theme of an orphan fighting\na monster in Jeunet\u2019s films. He laughs,\nhe must have answered similar questions before. \u201c[This is the] story of all\nmy films, even Life of Pi which I didn\u2019t\ndo because of finances. In Micmacs\n[the monster] is the weapon sellers, the\nbutcher in Delicatessen or the slimy\nmonster in Alien [Ressurection] but I\nhope one day I will change.\u201d The room\nis taken aback by the honesty of his\nanswer\nA dip in the Seine\nJeunet\u2019s biggest collaborator and good\nfriend is Dominique Pinon who has appeared in every single one of his films.\n\u201cI cant make a film without Dominque,\nit\u2019s not a question of superstition , it\u2019s\njust that he surprises me every time\nand he has a beautiful face. Marc Caro\nalways reminded Dominique that he\nhad a beautiful face\u201d. \u201cDo you have a\ncompetition to see how much you can\nput him though?\u201d\n\u201cNo not really, it became a kind of\ngame instead. He had to have protection against rat pee [Pinon is fired\nfrom a cannon into the Seine]. Under\nthe water we had two divers to pull him\nunder so he rises like a bubble.\u201d \u201cHow\ndid he react when you told him?\u201d \u201c Oh\nhe loved it, he had to spend a long time\nin the cannon and sometimes we said\n\u2018OK we\u2019re off to eat now.\u2019\u201d\nCamera shy\nDirectors often like to give themselves\ncameos in their own films, Hitchcock\nwas famous for it but Jeunet has never\nappeared in front of the camera. He\nexplains that he feels most comfortable in the director\u2019s chair and has\nnever felt the need to be immortalised\non celluloid although according to one\njournalist he was a natural showman\non stage at a Bafta event. \u201cBesides\u2019, he\nremarks \u201cI am too good-looking\u201d\nA question of ethics\nAnother reporter is intrigued by Jeunet\u2019s research into arms manufacture\nand inquires how was able to speak to\nBelgian weapon sellers.\n\u201cBy luck, I knew an ex-minister of\ndefence in Belgium and they were\nvery open, they even let us take pic-tures. We met some interesting peo-ple, they have a passion for technol-ogy, the factory is like a chocolate\nfactory but they forget the destination\nof the technology.\nWe stated that this is to kill people but\nthey insist they\u2019re on the right side,\n\u2018We work for the minister of defence\nnot the minister of attack. They protect themselves that way.\u201d\nGreen with envy\nAlthough Dany Boon seems the\nperfect choice for the character of Bazil, Jamel Debbouze was the original\nchoice for the part. \u201cDid the character\nof Bazil change when Dany came on\nboard?\u201d \u201cNo not a lot, Jamel Debbouze\nhas a handicap due to an incident\nwhen he was young. so he was originally meant to have the accident with\nthe mine but this was changed to Bazil\u2019s father. They [Dany and Jamel] are\nvery different in physical aspects, but\nin fact in the minds they are very simi-lar. They both come from the streets,\nthey have imagination, they are very\nclose.\u201d\nJeunet soon corrects a journalist\u2019s\nassumption that Dany Boon was originally a mime artist and at the same\ntime reveals his envy of his star\u2019s suc-cess. \u201cHe\u2019s not a mime but a one man\nshow, he\u2019s a writer, an actor and a di-rector. I\u2019m very jealous, he had twenty\none million admissions for Bienvenue\nchez les Ch\u2019tis [written and directed by\nBoon and the most successful film in\nFrance ever]. No can understand why.\nYes it was a good film and it was fun-ny. But in the world, it is very important for me that Amelie is the biggest\nFrench success. In France what can I\ndo?\u201d The room laughs nervously but\nit is obvious that Jeunet has swallowed\nhis pride to make Micmacs with Dany.\n\u201cDid you think of Dany Boon straight\naway?\u201d \u201cI thought Jamel could have an\naccident which is what happened so\nyes, I had Dany Boon on my mind. I\ndiscovered him seventeen years ago at\none of his one man shows. Everything\nabout him is good.\u201d\nA sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nMicmacs is Jeunet\u2019s sixth film and so\nwhere does it lie in the director\u2019s fil-mography? When Marc Caro was cowriter the films were quite dark in tone\n[Delicatessen, City of Lost Chidren] but\nwith Guillaume Laurent they are much\nlighter as with Amelie. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of\neverything I\u2019ve made, a kind of conclu-sion, now I need to make something\ndifferent. I have had some people approach me and say all you do is make\nthe same film and it\u2019s true because I\nwas supposed to make Life of Pi and\nit would have been very different but\nfor money reasons it didn\u2019t happen. If\nyou like my film its OK but if you don\u2019t,\nthen don\u2019t go to see it.\u201d\nYoung at heart\nOne of the reasons why Jeunet\u2019s films\nhave been so popular is the range of\npeople who can enjoy it. He wants a\nyoung audience to be able to enjoy\nMicmacs, especially children who typically watch Pixar films.\n\u201cEssentially the film is slapstick\u201d\nhe notes. The animated sculptures\ndesigned by \u2018Tiny Tim\u2019 seem to have\nbeen inspired by recent Pixar productions such as Wall-E. \u201cWe found\na man in a gallery in Paris who let us\nborrow his artwork. Nobody on set\nthought we would be able to build\nthem ourselves.\u201d\nOn Hollywood\nJean Pierre Jeunet has made only one\nfilm in Hollywood, Alien Ressurection\nwhich recieved mixed reviews. He was\nalso slated to directed the acclaimed\nnovel \u2018Life of Pi\u2019 which is now stuck\nin producton Hell. Would he go back\nto America though? \u201cWhy not? With\nLife of Pi, I had a great script and I had\nfreedom. Freedom is most important\nto me and in France I have complete\nfreedom. However with Hollywood\nthere are finances involved, Alien [Res-surection] was a fight with the studio\neveryday though I am very proud of\nthe film. I prefer the freedom, I would\nlike to find a compromise because I\nwant to shoot with American actors.\nMy agent in America said an American\nactor wants to meet you, he lives in\nNew York and his name is Al Pacino.\u201d\nIn a excited voice Jeunet adds \u201cand I\u2019m\nlike OK why not?!\u201d\nIdeally, Jeunet explains that he wants\nto shoot a French production [French\ncrew and financers] with an American\ncast like Luc Besson was able to do\nwith Taken.\nFinishing Touches\nAs the interview draws to an end, the\nquestions become more specific curiosities about aspects of Micmacs. One\nreporter is intrigued about a Delicatessen cameo. \u201cI wanted to make Amelie,\nit would have been funnier. I planned\nto see Amelie with kids (he does a\nhilarious impersonation of a crying\nbaby) but Audrey [Tatou] said no because she was shooting for Chanel.\nI can\u2019t resist to ask about a part of\nthe film which puzzled me a lot and\nthe answer probably puzzled me more.\n\u201cWhat was the significance of placing\nbillboards advertising Micmacs in the\nactual film?\u201d \u201cOh yeah, it doesn\u2019t make\nsense. I wanted to shoot so much so I\nthought \u2018I don\u2019t care!\u2019. It was funny for\nme, it will be funny for some people.\nThere are five billboards in the film, if\nyou didn\u2019t see them all then you will\nhave to buy the DVD!\u201d Apparently\nJean-Pierre is a bit of a joker.\nJeunet\u2019s assistant\u2019s pager bleeps and\na reporter gets in one last question\nabout if he finds his ideas from everyday life. \u201cI note everything and Guillaume Laurent does the same. In fact\nwhen you make a film, inspiration\ncomes from books or other films. I put\neverything in my ideas box.\u201d His assistant notes that time is up and Jeunet\nlooks pleased at how the interview has\ngone. He stands up, says a quick thank\nyou, \u201cHave a nice day!\u201d and quickly\nleaves the room. One thing is apparent\nthough, Jean Pierre Jeunet is a genius.\nFilm Editor Ed Knock is given a rare opportunity and plunges into the mind of the legendary French director\n\u201cMicmacs a mix\nof everything I\u2019ve\nmade, a kind of\nconclusion\u201d\n\n"

This behaviour\nis extremely rare amongst all apes,\nonly previously having been reported\namong orang-utans. Bonobos, once\nknown as pygmy chimps, are our closest relative alongside chimps from\nwhich they diverged during the past 1\nmillion years.\nDespite cannibalism being an uncommon behavioural trait, it may not\nbe aberrant, claims the scientist who\nwitnessed it. Researchers have been\nknown to emphasise the differences\nbetween chimpanzees and bonobos,\nwith the latter reported to be less vio-lent, aggressive or hostile to one anoth-er, and living in societies dominated by\nfemales as opposed to alpha males in\nchimp communities.\nIt was thought that bonobos did\nnot commit infanticide, or hunt and\neat other primate species. However,\na study published last year reported\nthat bonobos had been seen killing\nand eating monkeys. Primatologists Dr\nAndrew Fowler and Dr Gottfried Hohmann of the Max Planck Institute for\nEvolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,\nGermany have recorded an example of\na bonobo ape, along with other members of her group, consuming the body\nof her recently deceased 2 and a half\nyear-old infant.\nThe event was observed in a group\nof bonobos in the forest at Lui Kotale\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThe female called Olga was seen carrying her dead infant, Olivia, over her\nshoulder with no signs of injury. The\nnext day, Olga continued to carry Olivia and spent an hour grooming her.\n\u201cAfter an hour, Marta, a dominant female then took the body, retaining it\ndespite initial resistance from Olga.\nShe then began to consume it, joined\nby most of the community including\nthe mother,\u201d said Dr Fowler.\n\u201cConsumption took several hours,\nand possession of the carcass changed\nseveral times. At times Olga and\nOphelia, her remaining daughter, were\nnot involved but remained nearby\nthroughout the period,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen\na single foot and hand only remained\nattached to a long skin fragment, Olga\ntook the remains, placed them over her\nback and walked away.\u201d\nDr Fowler said that despite such\nbehaviour not being usual, it may be\nmore widespread than one, isolated\nincident. He hypothesised that researchers may have witnessed it, but\nnot reported it due to it drawing undue attention to cannibalism among\nour close relatives. On the other hand,\nthere may not have been enough long-term studies of bonobos to previously\nwitness it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that occasionally consuming dead infants, however distasteful it might seem to us, is a sign\nof pathology or aberration per se\u201d\ncommented Dr Fowler. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nit necessarily says anything about \u2018empathy\u2019 or \u2018morality\u2019.\u201d It had previously\nbeen suggested that bonobos might\nfeel more sympathy for victims, leading them to shun the hunting of mon-keys, for example.\nDr Fowler picks out that the \u201cinteresting question is why this female\nbonobo, Olga, allowed her infant to\nbe eaten, because this is not always\nthe case in chimpanzees. The incident\nmight tell us more about relationships\nbetween adults, and particularly adult\nfemales, in the sense that Marta was\nable to take and consume the body of\nanother female.\u201d\nA different\nkind of tourism\nBrigette Atkins\nBrigette Atkins Science Editor\nCannibalism evident amongst\n\u2018peace-loving\u2019 bonobos\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack\nA black Labrador named Treo has been awarded the Dickin\nMedal. This is the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross and\nis the highest accolade a military animal can receive. Treo, a\n9-year-old Labrador formerly based in Rutland, was honoured for his life-saving skills in sniffing out roadside bombs\nin Afghanistan. He joined soldiers patrolling in Afghanistan\nin 2008. Dogs are said to have a sense of smell that is a thousand times more sensitive than that of a human, due to having\nmore than 220 olfactory receptors in their noses. This enables\nthem to be useful in identifying material such as ex-plosives, drugs & forensic material.\nThis news comes following a\nrecent report that the Labrador is, still, the most popular\nbreed of dog in the world. It\nlooks as though they can do\nno wrong.\nScientists have claimed that music lessons could\nhave a direct impact on a child's ability to learn languages by affecting the mind's sensitivity to to all\ntypes of sound. Tests have revealed that exposure\nto music can be beneficial for the brain whilst in its\ndevelopmental stage, and could also aid children\nwith dyslexia and autism. The researchers from\nNorthwestern University in Chicago established\na link between musical ability and the capacity of\nthe nervous system to take in sound patterns. Professor Nina Kraus said \"Playing an instrument may\nhelp youngsters better process speech in noisy classrooms and more accurately interpret the nuances of\nlanguage that are conveyed by subtle changes in the\nhuman voice.\"\nSoundproofing has always been a problem for\npeople who live next door to nocturnal beings\nwith a penchant for loud music. However, rather\nthan building a big wall, Zhiyu Yang from Hong\nKong University of Science and Technology in\nKowloon has developed a soundproof panel\nmade of latex and plastic buttons that does the\njob more effectively. The noise-cancelling panels consist of a latex rubber membrane stretched\nover a 3 mm-thick rigid plastic grid of\n1cm-wide squares, with a small plastic\nbuttoninthecentre.When waveshit\nthe sound panel, the membrane and\nbuttons resonate at different fre-quencies, resulting in waves cancel-lingeachotheroutandalackofsound\npenetrating the wall.\nM\nany of us are all too\nfamiliar with the libel\nwar being fought between Simon Singh\nand the British Chiropractic Association. Tuesday marked\nthe latest stage in this ongoing case\nwhen Singh presented his appeal to senior judges \u2013 see Duncan\u2019s article. Whilst\nthis is the most publicised libel case at\nthe moment, it is by no means isolated.\nDr Peter Wilmhurst is currently being sued by NMT Medical over a claim\nthat data from a trail of one of their\nproducts is flawed. Being sued for libel is not a cheap affair. Wilmhurst\nhas already lost \u00a3280,000 in court\nfees and this figure is set to rise as the\ncase continues. Even a victory in the\ncourtroom would be bittersweet as\ncourt fees cannot always be recovered\nfrom the side pressing charges. In this\ncase, NMT Medical are unwilling to\nsubsidise these costs should they lose\nbecause, rather ironically, a demand\nsuch as this on a foreign company may\nviolate the European Convention on\nHuman Rights. I\u2019m guessing that when\nthis convention was set out, impedance of free speech was not one of its\nobjectives.\nSo if all that\u2019s to face is a lose-lose\noutcome, why don\u2019t scientists and writers such as Dr Wilmhurst just back\ndown, admit defeat and apologise, regardless of their beliefs? In a column\nby Simon Singh in the Telegraph this\nweek, Wilmhurst is quoted as saying \u201cIf\nI fail to speak out\u2026I am breaking the\nHippocratic Oath. I\u2019d rather be sued for\nlibel.\u201d Freedom of speech is evidently\nsomething above monetary value.\nOf course, it isn\u2019t just scientific debate being stifled. Britain\u2019s laws practically invite anyone with sufficient\nwealth to enter the circus that is our\ncourtrooms and try their hand at suing\nfor libel. \u2018Libel tourism\u2019 is a term being used more and more these days as\nBritain plays host to cases from all over\nthe world, the only requirement being\nthat the publication in question where\nthe claim was made is obtainable in the\nUK.\nA paper by Article 19, an organisation campaigning to maintain what\nshould be one of our most basic human rights, details the case of Rachel\nEhrenfeld. A wealthy Saudi, Sheikh\nKhalid bin Mahfouz brought a case to\nthe UK courts against Ehrenfeld (an\nAmerican) after claims made in her\nbook \u2018Funding Evil\u2019 \u2013 now unavailable\nafter selling only a handful of copies in\nthe UK. Not only is this a case of \u2018libel\ntourism\u2019, but it concerns me that Mahfouz has already sued using UK libel\nlaws. More than 20 times.\nI am by no means suggesting that\nwriters should be allowed to publish\nanything - there should be justification\nabove just a personal dislike for an individual or organisation. But I believe\nthat, for a democratic country, the UK\nis making itself a global laughing stock\nthrough these laws where proof is the\ndefendant\u2019s responsibility.\nOn Wednesday, a parliamentary\npanel agreed \u201c[libel tourism] should be\na matter of profound concern for the\nUK\u201d. But whilst many MPs are in support of reform, few are willing to commit to the cause. I feel the onus is now\non us to put pressure on MPs to act. I\nurge you, if you get a moment, to look\nat www.libelreform.org and add your\nname to the list \u2013 Stephen Fry already\nhas, so it must be important!\nIn other news \u2013 a report from the\nCommons is set to call for homeopathy\nfunding by the NHS to be cut.

The letter\nshows the CGCU swallowing their\npride and admitting their \u201cwrong doing was a case of poor misjudgement\u201d.\nThe letter continues \u201cIn what was\nthought to be an act of mascotry, a\nsmall minority of our members took\nit upon themselves to remove The\nBottle from the Union bar. I am assured that there was no intention to\npermanently deprive and that The\nBottle has been returned as quickly as\npossible.\u201d\nMascotry is a historical tradition\nbetween rival Faculty Unions at Imperial. Each Faculty Union, and RAG\nhave at least one violate mascot. The\nCGCU have two in Spanner and Bolt,\nthe RSM have Davy (a Davy mining\nlamp), and the RCSU hold a 7ft stainless steel thermometer named Theta.\nThe idea is for members of the Faculty\nUnions to use skill, intelligence and\ndeviance to \u2018capture\u2019 others\u2019 mascots.\nTo keep proceedings friendly, only\nviolate mascots can be \u2018stolen\u2019. Mascots are generally brought out during\nFaculty Union events, such as Friday\u2019s\nTri-Union Bar night.\nThe Bottle now sits at its rightful place in the Union Bar, whilst\nthe violate RSM mascot, Davy, remains missing, but they now hold\nthe CGCU Spanner. Chris, the giant\nRAG collecting tin is also missing.\nThe CGCU currently hold neither of\ntheir mascots after Bolt was taken by\ninebriated Scientist in another embarrassingly easy capture by the RCSU\nduring the CGCU Bonfire bar night in\nNovember.\nOne detachable third of Theta remains in Guildsmen\u2019s hands. It was\ntaken from the felix office after Sabbatical Scientist and felix Editor Dan\nWan chose a poor hiding place for it.\nLeft, the Bottle was returned to its rightful place behind the Union Bar, and\nright, Spanner in a taunting RSM Chaps tie after a successful Miners\u2019 capture\nT\nhe European Commission\u2019s competition regulators have opened\na preliminary antitrust investigation into Google, according\nto both the commission and the company. The commission\nreceived complaints about Google from Foundem, a British price\ncomparison website, Ciao.de, a Microsoft owned shopping site, and ejustice.\nfr, a French legal search site. Each complaint was slightly different in nature but centred around Google\u2019s search ranking methodology or advertising\nterms and conditions. Google was notified earlier in the month by the EU\nabout the probe and has been asked to respond to the allegations brought\nforth. Intriguingly, there already seem to be quite apparent connections from\nMicrosoft, no stranger to EU competition regulation, and two of the complaining companies. Microsoft has made huge investments into its search\nengine, Bing, only to see Google\u2019s dominance grow both in search and in ad-vertising, most notably in Europe. Recent statistics from Seomoz claim that\n85% of search engine referrals to other websites come from Google, a figure\nsignificantly higher than any claims by Google itself.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Tom Greany\nT\nhe creator of Twitter, CEO\nof eBay, head of Mozilla, and\nAshton Kutcher were sent to\nRussia in a delegation summoned by U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Rodham Clinton. The delegation\nwas aimed at discussing how social net-works, new media, and communication\ntools can improve ties between the two\ncountries. The delegation followed similar ones to both Mexico and Iraq,\nwhich led the Iraqi Government to establish a YouTube channel as well as\nthe Mexicans establishing an SMS crime hotline. The delegates met with\nRussian ministers, presidential advisors, business leaders, as well as health,\nwelfare, and anti-corruption activists and discussed technological collabo-ration, cyber crime, health, governance, and cultural collaboration. Russia\nis the biggest consumer of social networks per capita, according to Comscore, which stated that the average Russian adult spends 6.6 hours a month\non social networking websites.\nRussia\nS\nNCF, operator of the majority of the French rail network, including the TGV, has come under great criticism for circulating signs warning about baggage thefts by Romanians, stating\nthat \u201call acts by Romanians must be reported\u201d to the railway\u2019s\nsecurity staff. Romanians in France are reportedly outraged by the signs,\nlabelling them an example of \u201canti-Romanian racism\u201d. A rail workers union made similar statements against the signs. The event has raised larger\nquestions of relations between France and Romania, as well as ItalianRomanian relations. A sizeable portion of the French population opposed\nRomania\u2019s entrance into the EU and Silvio Berlusconi, Italian Prime Minister, controversially singled out Romanians in trying to explain crime\nlevels in his country. The signs were apparently made by a rogue railway\nagent and the organisation promised to evaluate how their creation was\npossible. SNCF security stated that no reports of Romanian activity had\nbeen received following the posting of the signs.\nFrance\nEurope\n\n"

    "content": "11\nfelix FRIDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2010\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk SCIENCE\nThere aren\u2019t many policies from\nGeorge Bush\u2019s eight years that one\ncan claim the current president of the\nUnited States is ruining, but for those\nof us who were hoping to spend their\n30th birthday maxin\u2019 & relaxin\u2019 on the\nmoon, the chances are starting to look\npretty Obysmal. Barack\u2019s proposal last\nweek to abort NASA\u2019s lunar plans majorly pissed off scientists worldwide,\nand not just the evil scientists who torture bunnies with shampoo.\nThe project in question is the Constellation programme: envisaging new\nrockets and a new crewship called\nOrion (names after the asterism, not\nthe plural of \u2018Oreo\u2019) to put astronauts\non the moon by 2020, and conceivably\nhumans on Mars by the middle of the\ncentury. But in his 2011 budget request\nissued on Feb 1st, Obama described\nthe project as \u201cbehind schedule, and\nlacking in innovation\u201d. So much for\nDubya\u2019s plans to invade Mars (sorry,\nbring \u2018peace and democracy\u2019 to Mars).\nUnfortunately, Nasa has already\nspent a slick $9 billion (\u00a35.6 billion) on\nConstellation, and it will cost an estimated $2.5 billion more just to close\ndown the project. And you thought\nsigning up for \u2018Get Ripped in Three\nWeeks\u2019 online was a mistake.\nFormer NASA administrator\nMichael Griffin, who advocated the\nConstellation program, describes\nObama\u2019s budget as disastrous for human space flight. \u201cIt means that essentially the U.S. has decided that they\u2019re\nnot going to be a significant player in\nhuman space flight for the foreseeable\nfuture. The path that they\u2019re on with\nthis budget is a path that can\u2019t work,\u201d\nhe said.\nThis may not be good for America\u2019s\nalready deteriorating ego, but imagine how pleased the Russians will be\nto finally have a chance at winning the\nspace race (the last time they did was\nin 1957 with Sputnik). I can just picture Putin celebrating by taking a triple distilled bath in Smirnoff, and getting Medvedev to massage caviar onto\nhis head. Interestingly, the legendary\n\u2018space race\u2019, which began in 1947, was\ninitially just for bragging rights, but\ndeveloped into a competition for claim\nof new technology. Modern-day space\ninstitutes contend almost entirely for\nthese rights.\nIndeed, faster computers, better\nmedicines, advanced composites and\nalloys, and thousands of other technologies all owe their development to\nspace research. Space technology has\nshaped the fabric of society in ways\nwe would never had thought of. Even\neveryday objects can be traced back\nto a breakthrough in a NASA lab. The\ntwo examples I found of this are not\nvery inspiring; foam padding adapted\nfor helmets and flexible tires on the\nApollo 14 pull-cart incorporated into\nwinter radial car tires. So, next time\nyou bump into an astrophysicist, give\nhim (or him) a hug.\nBack to the news: Obama\u2019s budget\nrequest, if approved by Congress, will\nhand over some spacecraft development to the private sector. The budget\ncalls for companies to spend $6 billion over five years to develop a commercial spacecraft that could taxi astronauts into low Earth orbit i.e. not\nmuch chance of a moon visit in our life\ntime (sad emoticon). The Obama administration simply does not have the\ncash to fund any space projects with-Obama to abort NASA lunar program?\nArjun Hassard\nArjun Hassard\nOn Tuesday, journalist, author and\nex-Imperial scientist Simon Singh presented an appeal to the three most senior judges in the UK, fighting to be allowed to expose dangerous, deluded or\ndownright insane practices in healthcare and alternative medicine. You\nmight not have thought such a case\nwould be necessary: after all, the law\nexists to protect the rights of whistle-blowers and investigative journalists,\ndoesn\u2019t it? Unfortunately, under the\nUK\u2019s current archaic libel laws, it appears that the truth is little defence.\nSingh found himself in court after\nan article written in the Guardian almost two years ago, in which he analysed chiropractors\u2019 claims to be able\nto cure infant ear infections and colic\nthrough the medium of rearranging\ntheir vertebrae. Now, shuffling the\nbones in an adult carries some fairly\nsignificant risks \u2013 it\u2019s not unknown\nfor neck manipulations in particular to\ncause strokes and paralysis; doing it to\nan infant, however, is simply danger-ous. Worse still, it isn\u2019t even effective\n\u2013 there is no robust evidence at all to\nsuggest that the \u2018therapy\u2019 has any merit\nwhatsoever. Singh dared to point this\nout, and rather than reveal the \u201cplethora of evidence\u201d upon which the British\nChiropractic Association (BCA) based\ntheir bullshit theories, they instead\nopted to sue for libel, for the damage\nhe had allegedly done to their other-wise-pristine reputation.\nThe UK has something of a reputation when it comes to libel law. The\nlaws under which such cases are\njudged are so arcane and so unfit-for-purpose that it is almost impossible to\ndefend one. Even the rare successes\nare somewhat Pyrrhic, as the average\ncost of such a victory is round about\nthe same as the price of a house in London \u2013 meaning that your average jour-nalist, researcher or science student\ncan\u2019t possibly hope to defend them-selves. Furthermore, the UK courts\u2019\nout some private investment \u2013 for the\nConstellation endeavour it\u2019s quite literally an \u2018Insert More Coins\u2019 scenario.\nGoing commercial with a human\ncrew would represent a dramatic\nchange in the way NASA does busi-ness. Instead of NASA owning the\nspacecraft and overseeing every nut\nand bolt of its design and construc-tion, a private company would design\nand build the spacecraft with NASA\nlooking over its shoulder. We can attribute this undesirable situation to\nthe recession, but it seems these days\nthat the recession is blamed for everything e.g. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you flush?\u2019...\n\u2018Recession\u2019.\nPerhaps the question we have missed\nis: why would mankind even want to\nreturn to the moon? If successful, it\ncould lead to privately-owned moon\ncolonies, providing even more opportunities in research. It would finally\nshut up all the conspiracy theorists.\nAnd it would be a magnificent human\nachievement. As Isaac Asimov stated,\n\u201cWhy spend billions to place a man\non the Moon? If we don\u2019t, we may lose\nthe Earth. If we do, we may gain the\nuniverse. You couldn\u2019t ask for better\nodds.\u201d Even though he sounds like he\nworks in William Hill, he\u2019s apparently\nthe greatest science fiction writer of all\ntime.\nWhether the public pays for it\nthrough retail prices or taxes, the\nspace race continues. But now, it is\nnot between competing countries, but\ncountries\u2019 governments and private\nindustries.\nLooks like the Cheese Society are going to have to wait a little while longer to realise their plans for a trip to the moon\nSimon Singh\u2019s battle for free speech continues\nsomewhat self-important definition of\njurisdiction means that people from all\nover the world who wish to stifle criticism choose to do so in London. As\na result, there are currently laws in a\nnumber of US states, specifically limiting the application of UK libel decisions on US citizens. It\u2019s not just a\nproblem, it\u2019s an embarrassment.\nTuesday\u2019s hearing seemed to go well\n- the panel of judges gave the BCA\u2019s\ncounsel a thorough roasting, both for\ntheir seeming inability to accept criticism and for the \u201cartificiality\u201d of the\ncase, that \u201cat the end of this someone will pay an enormous amount of\nmoney, whether it be from Dr Singh\u2019s\nfunds or the funds of BCA subscribers\u201d to resolve a case that could have\nbeen settled in the way such scientific\ndisputes are normally \u2013 via the open\npublication and robust criticism of the\nevidence. It\u2019s what we do. The BCA\napparently doesn\u2019t agree, and as a result the safety and efficacy of a medical\n(or at least pseudo-medical) treatment\nwill now be decided by the courts, as\nopposed to via clinical trial.\nDuncan Casey\nDuncan Casey\nTuesday\u2019s hearing seemed to go well for Singh who is being sued by the BCA\n\n"

This,\nhowever, was regrettably not the case.\nBirds of Tokyo were the first band to\nplay - their tunes were relatively catchy\nand at least the singer was compre-hensible. Though they were perhaps\nlacking in \u201ccool factor\u201d with the lead\nsinger\u2019s dancing looking like a cross between Buddy Holly and a seal and with\nevery band member in possession of receding hairlines and \u201cdad-style\u201d danc-ing. However in total they were pretty\nmuch heartrendingly generic with almost every song sounding similar to\na song you\u2019d heard before by another\nband and impressively repetitive lyrics.\nBut they were the first band, I was sure\nthat the bands playing next were going\nto be good... or at least better.\nNext General Fiasco walk onto the\nstage and, to be brutally honest, one\ncould hardly even describe them as\nhaving been a general fiasco - they\nwere really far too forgettable for\nsuch a description. They look exactly\nlike any other indie band except with\nwhinier vocals. I\u2019m afraid to say I cannot comment on the lyricism because\nI couldn\u2019t hear any of the words. True,\nthey did support \u201cmassive acts\u201d such\nas One Night Only and The Pigeon\nDetectives, in other words other dull\npseudo-mainstream indie bands with\nvery little artistic vision. Possibly the\nexplanation for this is that General\nFiasco perhaps made these mediocre\nbands seem good by comparison.\nBand of Skulls were the final band to\nplay and I was surprised, I had suspected Death Metal but was instead greeted by White Stripes style rock, which\nwas never something I was a fan of in\nthe first place. I was not convinced by\nthe man\u2019s voice, however the female\nbassist was considerably better. Perhaps their set would have improved,\nbut after having been unimpressed\nfor two hours already and then having\na girl asking me to move because she\ncouldn\u2019t see. If you have met me you\u2019ll\nrealise you need to be about 12 years\nold to have your view blocked by me,\nI decided that enough was enough and\nleft before the end. - Renny Norman\nGeneral Fiasco\nRelentless Garage\n12 February\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nThey\u2019re just generally a fiasco\nP\nicture the moment.

The temperature\u2019s a steamy\n30 degrees and the sun is taking an absolute age to drop down under the horizon. You\u2019re\nsitting in sandals and shorts and tonight you and\nyour friends will get to see Jay-Z, Vampire Weekend, the Specials, Passion Pit and Grizzly Bear\namongst others. Coachella is maybe the greatest\nmusic festival on the planet. It happens in Indio,\nCalifornia on 16th April. It\u2019ll cost you a cool $269\nto get in and you\u2019ve got to get there anyway. So\nfor now it\u2019ll remain a dream. - Kadhim Shubber\nL\nocated in Austin, Texas, SXSW is a\nshowcase for new bands and other\ncreative-types to grab the attention of\nrecord industry pimps and make it to\nthe big time. However, instead of the\nusual hippie camping and baby wipes, 80 bars and\nclubs are used as venues so that weak non-Texan\nattendees don\u2019t die from overheating.\nThis year, the music event includes Good\nShoes, the XX, and We Are Scientists among the\nother 1,894 I have never heard of which doesn\u2019t\nmatter as everyone there will be inebriated with\nTexan man beer and high on Texan man burgers\nanyway. - Lily Le\nSome festivals are really far away\nT\nhis festival is actually within range. It\nhappens on the 27th of May which for\nsome lucky 3rd and 4th years means\nthat your exams might be over in time.\nSo grab a cheap Easyjet flight over to\nBarcelona (which is an appealing prospect in it-self) and then expose your ears to one of the most\namazing lineups in recent history.\nThe tickets will set you back \u20ac150 and so with\na cheap flight, this festival won\u2019t actually cost you\nmuch more than say Glastonbury or Reading.\nAnd considering that U2 are headlining Glastonbury, it might be worth that extra bit to see Pixies\nand Pavement AND Wilco. - Kadhim Shubber\nF\nuji Rock is a 3 day festival, set in the\nidyllic ski resort of Niigata Prefecture\nin Japan, which coincidently is nowhere near Mount Fuji! 30th July \u2013 1st\nAugust, the line-up this year has yet to\nbe confirmed but last year\u2019s bill included Oasis,\nFranz Ferdinand, White Lies and some Japanese\nstuff. OK, so it was mainly Japanese stuff and\nyes you could probably see all of these people\nat a festival somewhere closer to home for a hell\nof a lot cheaper because it\u2019s touch expensive at\n\u00a3236 for a ticket that doesn\u2019t even include camping but it\u2019s in JAPAN!!!

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2010\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Empire Strikes Back At The Saatchi\nRosie Milton on the current exhibit, better called \u2018Artwork from India Which Really Needs No Clich\u00e9d Title\u2019\nI\ncouldn\u2019t help but begin my tour\nof the exhibition by thinking\nabout the work and the use of\nthe gallery space in comparison to the last show I had seen\nhere \u2013 The Revolution Continues:\nNew Chinese Art (or Works of Chinese Artists Saatchi has Gathered and\nis Presenting to the Public as New Art\n\u2018Stars\u2019). Titles for these recent exhibitions have been blockbuster-y to say\nthe least.\nThe work however, really does not\nreflect a heading that sounds so smug\nand attention-grabbing in any other\nsense. Putting aside surface concerns\nabout Saatchi and his \u2018megabucks\u2019\nshows, I took in the work and was\npleasantly surprised by much of it \u2013\nproving I think, that it is always worthwhile to look at fresh work.\nAs there were a lot of artworks, I\nreverted to my default way of seeing \u2013 aesthetically \u2013 before locking\nin to stronger issues. Indian culture\nand politics are a hidden world to me;\nespecially with the language barrier-script was an overarching feature of\nsome of the works I liked best. What\nwas interesting for me, was considering who the works were for: one of the\nlargest works, \u2018Public Notice 2\u2019 by Jitish Kallat features a wall-length and\nwall-high text in English \u2013 a speech by\nGhandi. This fact seemed to pass the\nother viewers by, despite their knowledge that this exhibition focuses on a\ncountry whose native tongue is different to ours, but also that this country\nhas had a complicated history \u2013 in\nmany ways shaped by our own. Reading a little research behind this speech,\nGhandi spoke these words on the eve\nof the Dandi Salt March \u2013 a protest\nagainst the British salt tax in colonial India, 1930. If only meant to suggest the greatness of a bold man, the\nwords illustrated in \u2018Public Notice 2\u2019 in\nbones \u2013 speak volumes about historical feelings.\nA textual language, unfamiliar to me\nbecomes a visual field of signs. I started thinking about language as imagery\nand of course there is a strong body\nof theoretical thought behind ideas of\nthis nature. Shezad Dawood\u2019s electrifying work \u2018The Bestower\u2019, \u2018The Judge\u2019,\n\u2018The Protector\u2019 and \u2018The Majestic\u2019 \u2013 a\nseries of tumbleweed bushes encased\nin vitrines, with neon characters literally burning through them, instantly\nspoke to me with biblical reference.\nInitially I thought I should reconsider\nmy first interpretation, bearing in\nmind the focus of the exhibition on art\nfrom (and necessarily about?) India.\nHowever, such are the movements of\npeople in the world today that a cross-referencing of culture, religion and\nlanguage is what is at stake in many of\nthese artworks.\nAnother work that interested me was\nTushar Joag\u2019s \u2018The Enlightening Army\nOf The Empire\u2019 \u2013 a glittering regiment\nof metal figures, each resembling the\nhuman form by their posture, limb\nstructure and each individually harbouring a light or electric tube that\ncrudely suggested an essential vital\norgan. These twinkling, motionless\ngiants looked grand in their corner of\nthe gallery, but their simplicity is also\nreminiscent of the found object and\nultimately how much use, if even only\nto mimic ourselves, we can make out\nof the things others throw away. Here,\nthese treasures struck a chord with me\nabout the fragility of the human body.\nOn closer investigation, several of the\nfigures hold aloft fluorescent tubes \u2013\na futile but poignant substitute for a\nsword.\nSubodh Gupta features in the show\nwith works that I felt were fairly mod-est, considering his usual oeuvre with\nwhich I\u2019m familiar, but perhaps fitting in this context. I first encountered\nGupta at the Tate Triennial back in\nearly 2009. His signature style, as I understand it, is to create large sculptures\nout of a mass of small, everyday metal\nutensils. His work at Altermodern (the\nTate Triennial) at the Tate Britain was\nnothing less than monumental \u2013 a giant mushroom cloud filled the iconic\ncupola in the main hall, in a stationary\nexplosion of shining pewter-ware. At\nthe Saatchi, an irregular giant metal\nbucket: the kind in which chilled\nchampagne is normally brought, (one\ncould observe parallels here) held an\noverflow of regular-sized silvery uten-sils, in the aptly titled \u2018Spill\u2019.\nAlmost every work, but especially\nthose that I felt spoke to me with the\nmost clarity, reflected the grandeur of\na greater idea, but in modest terms.\nAlthough emphatically labelled as \u2018art\nfrom India\u2019 by the structuring and titling of this show, external and worldly\ninfluences are palpable.\nHowever, the kind of patience spoken through such modesty apparent in\nthese artworks tells a truth about the\nhistory and homeland of these artists.\nShezad Dawood, \u2018The Judge\u2019, Subodh Gupta, \u2018Spill\u2019 and Jitish Kallat, \u2018Public Notice 2\u2019, all works \u00a9 the artists named\nTushar Joag, \u2018The Enlightening Army Of The Empire\u2019 \u2013 these delicate, marvellous \u2018soldiers\u2019 guard a corner of the gallery\n\n"

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2010\nW\nhen I was younger,\nand had time on my\nhands and nothing better to do, I\nfrequently fell ill.\nNothing particularly debilitating or life-threatening, you understand, only regular healthy doses of the common cold or\nflu. Influenza, as they say, and out flew\nmy health.\nIt is possibly one of the best indications\nwhen a happy childhood that memories\nof sickness past are fond and reassuring\nones. The cramped stomach associated\nwith food poisoning is forgotten, but the\nmeal of chicken nuggets we were allowed\nto enjoy afterwards remains. The swollen\nthroats and broken fingers pale by com-parisonwiththesympatheticbedsidevis-it from our grandparents, or the presents\nwaiting for us when we started to recover.\nThere are, of course, moments of\nchildhood hardship we all remember\nwith pride, and whose real or imagined\nscars still provide us with stories worth\ndining out on. Even if our dinner companions may not be too keen on eating\nwhile we tell them.\nI suppose I\u2019ve been comparatively\nlucky to make it through the long and\ndeformative years of adolescence without looking noticeably different to when I\nstarted out. Well, I use \u2018lucky\u2019 in a relative\nsense. I might have come out looking like\nGeorge Clooney.\nOtherthanacrossonmyfingertomark\nthe spot where a sailor\u2019s son once buried\nthe blade of his father\u2019s Swiss army knife,\nI survived my teenage years unharmed. I\nlook slightly less like a potential fullback\nthan I did when I first came through the\nuprights, perhaps, but I\u2019ve made up for\nthat with a luxurious head of hair and a\nsplendidly Roman set of earlobes.\nAs a result of this idyllic youth, my\nown memories may not represent an\naccurate cross-section of The Great\nBritish Public. But as The Poet once\nsaid: \u201cwhen did that ever stop me from\nshooting my fat mouth off anyway?\u201d\nSorry, that should be A Poet. Why\nshould the sons suffer for the crimes of\nthe father?\nAmongst my warmest and fuzziest\nmemories are those of winters where the\noutside temperature continued to fall\nas my internal temperature rose, and I\nwas sloshing to the gills with deconges-tive syrups and warm chicken soup. My\npajamas laced with eucalyptus capsules,\nI would lie on my bed for all the world\nlike a koala caught in a rare moment of\ninsomnolence.\nWhat I remember as being hours of\ncoughing and restless sub-duvet gymnastics probably lasted no longer than a\nfew minutes, but if I am happy with the\nillusion then who are you to rob me of it?\nIf that\u2019s the way you\u2019re going to behave,\nyoung reader, then why don\u2019t you just go\nback to where you came from and read\nthe Catnip section, where they\u2019re used\nto this sort of puerile interruption. Now\nwhere was I? Oh yes, tossing and turning\ntill the early hours of the morning.\nIt\u2019s one of life\u2019s facetious little ironies\nthat bed is possibly the hardest place for\na tired pair of eyes to finally close. I can\nhappily slumber in planes, I will cheerily\ndoze on sofas and the pen will eventually,\nthough inexcusably, drop from my relaxing fingers during the odd lecture. But\nturn the airplane seat into a bed, make\nme lie crosswise on the sofa and not lean\nagainst the armrest, or infuse the lecture\ntheatre with a nocturnal degree of peace\nand quiet, and I suddenly find myself\nalert and restive and reaching for my\nfallen pen.\nSo if falling asleep in bed proved too\ndifficult a task for the misguided child I\nonce was, I would creep to the television\nroom, blanket held cape-like around my\nshoulders, and sit in my father\u2019s armchair\nopposite the bulging screen. My parents\nhave since got rid of that deep burgundy\nleather armchair, but it will always furnish the salon of my memory with its\nbaroquely curlicued armrests, its rows of\nshining metal studs and an overwhelming smell of French polish.\nOnce I had satisfactorily ensconced\nmyself in the armchair\u2019s all-embracing\nfolds, I would reach for the remote control and, making sure to press the mute\nbutton simultaneously with the on\nswitch, turn the television on. And so,\nlate into the night, \u2018ickle me would be\nlulled into the inviting arms of Morpheus\nby the gentle sound of EuroSport\u2019s English-language commentators discussing\nthe latest curling championships.\nFor this reason, more than any other,\nmore even than the little-known and\nrarely-admitted fact that I once spent\na week of evenings in an alpine resort\nlearning how to curl, I have a great and\noverriding sympathy for the sport of\ncurling. For the stones which bruised\nand battered my ankles, for the ridiculous plastic brooms which made me lose\nwhatever grip I claimed to have on the\nice, and the rules which I would certainly\nhave forgotten had I ever bothered to\nlearn them.\nBeing neither a psychic nor one of\nthose curious individuals whose secretive and intriguing profession it is to\ngather statistics about television viewing\nfigures, I am unable to guess how many\nof you have been watching coverage of\nthe Vancouver Winter Olympics. A few\nof you, I\u2019ll wager, or else Hazel Irvine will\nbe in for a nasty shock when she returns\nnext week to find a nation desperate to\nknow where she\u2019s been.\nThose of you, however, who join me\nin frying the midnight oil will doubtless\nhave your own preferred sports, your\nown most memorable moments and\nleast interesting commentators from\nthese XXIst\ngames. But as civilised peo-ple, the one thing on which I hope we\ncan all agree is that the BBC\u2019s choice of\nlead-in music and animation sequence\ngrows on one like a bad case of Rhizopus\nStolonifer, the so-called \u2018Galloping Grey\nGhost\u2019 of fungi.\nFor those of you who have so far not\nbeen exposed to the aforementioned\nexpository footage, it can be viewed for\na reasonable licence fee on BBC2, or for\nnothing on Ye olde Tube.\nTo my initial mystification, we are\nshown a hooded Canadian surrounded\nby wolves in a dark forest. Following a\nrapid escape on makeshift skis, an improvised snowboard and a lightweight luge,\nour hero faces the spirit of an angry bear\nlocked inside a glacier. To increasingly\ndramatic chords, he curls what I can only\nassume is a hockey mask into the wall of\nice, thereby freeing a missing section of\nthe Vancouver Olympics totem. In the\nprocess, of course, he causes a glacier to\ndisintegrate. I\u2019ll let you-all speculate as to\nthe message behind that one.\nAll I know is that when I return from\nlate nights at college or the union, and\ncollapse in front of BBC2, it\u2019s a delicious\ntreat for me to find that the winter Olympics are being broadcast. There is something so much more comforting about\nthe pristine whiteness of the snow than\nthe harsh colours of the tarmac or the\ngymnasium.\nThe sports may seem sterile and dis-tant, but human nature is such that the\nsimple knowledge that there will be a\nwinner and a loser is enough to suffuse the most banal of endeavours with\na degree of interest worthy of 1980s\nAmerica. As the skiers carve their way\ndown the slopes, their bodies almost\nentirely hidden in protective soft-shells\nand goggles, and the lugers are flagged\nup by the metal detectors before they\nhave a chance to fire, it\u2019s easy to forget\nthe pressures these athletes are putting\non their bodies. There\u2019s no need to focus on the unpleasantness of sweat or\nperceived effort: the Winter Olympics\nalways take place in a protective cocoon of snow and fairydust, and that\nis why they will always be so magical.\nColinHillagainst the union refurbishments\nA\ns I\u2019m sure most of you\nhave read recently, the\nUnion has decided to\nspend \u00a32.4 million on\nrenovating dB\u2019s and da\nVinci\u2019s. Personally, I like the union the\nway it is; it\u2019s a fantastic establishment\nwhere all my friends are, \u201ccutting up\nsome mad shapes on the D-Floor\u201d is\nperfectly acceptable and the staff give\nthe right amount of leniency to raucous behaviour.\nDo we really need to spend \u00a32.4 million pounds on renovations? No. A new\nnightclub will not suddenly change the\nUnion from being a rampant sausage\nfest into a quality establishment. In my\nopinion, there are much better uses for\nthis money: either pump it back into\nthe clubs and societies, whose members have spent so much of there not so\nhard earned student loans in there, or\nuse it to offer better drink promotions\nto students. From my own calculations\nI worked out that \u00a32.4 million pounds\ncould provide free beer to students for\nat least 5 years or make it half price for\n10 (based on 4500 pints per week)! Of\ncourse, people will say this plan isn\u2019t\nsustainable but surely within the next\n10 years even more money will be\nspent redoing the union. After all the\ncurrent set up is only a few years old.\ndB\u2019s is most full on a Wednesday, especially ACC bar nights, and I\u2019m pretty\nsure most sports players would prefer\n\u00a31 beers all the time than a new night-club. The student\u2019s favourite after all is\nCheapskates; a shitty hole in Soho but\nwith 80p drinks, a comical decor and\npacked to the rafters every Wednesday\n(and Monday). It\u2019s clearly true that no\none really cares where they are, if your\nwith your mates, the booze is cheap\nand the establishment is marginally\nbetter than Josef Fritzl\u2019s basement then\nthe night is guaranteed for success. All\nthe Union needs is a few leopard skin\nsofas, some zebra print carpets and\nsome dance poles.\nI\u2019ve got a solution to the fucking pillar problem, make it a pole for drunk\nAmericans to dance around after a few\ntoo many snakebites on a Friday night.\nThe classic response from the Union is\nthat our bars are the cheapest in London. Not true. The Goose is \u00a31.65 for\na Tetley\u2019s, a smooth 35p less than John\nSmiths and \u00a36 for a bottle of Blossom\nHill, a crisp \u00a34 less than the house in\nthe Union.\nDon\u2019t even get me started on the\nnew names proposed. As humorous as\n\u201cgoing for a pint in the library\u201d would\nbe, the novelty would soon wear off.\nWhen UCL did the same thing they\nended up with a bar called the Chris\nAkabusi Pleasure Lounge. Do we really\nlack a sense of humour that \u201cLibrary\u201d\nis the best we could come up with? If\nyou agree with me, please email Ashley Brown at president@imperial.ac.uk\nunder the header \u201cI\u2019d rather have free\nbeer than a new nightclub!\u201d We can\nmake a difference people!\nGilead Amit and the Winter Olympics\n\u201c...a solution to\nthe f**king pillar\nproblem, make it a\npole for Americans\nto dance around\u201d\n\u201cI use \u2018lucky\u2019 in a\nrelative sense. I\nmight have come\nout looking like\nGeorge Clooney.\u201d\n\n"

DAN WAN INVESTIGATES\nI\nt has long been instilled in\nmany a student\u2019s mind that they\nshould be coming out of University with at least upper second\nclass honours if they\u2019re to make\nthe leap to employment afterwards.\nThey say without a 2:1 in your respective degree, you\u2019re destined to life in a\ndead-end job, and failing that, unem-ployment. Whilst others continue to\nfly high, you remain on the dole.\nWhether you believe the urban myth\nthat surrounds not receiving a 2:1 or\nnot, there is undoubtedly a stigma that\ndrags along with not getting one.\nButdoes\u20182:2\u2019stickoutlikeasorethumb\non your CV? More importantly, does it\nimmediately make you a less favourable\ncandidate for a job? Seemingly not.\nPricewaterhouse \u2013 Coopers (PwC),\none of the UK\u2019s largest accountancy\nfirms and graduate recruiters, have\nrecently announced a new programme\nthat looks for \u201cinspired talent\u201d. The\nnecessity of a 2:1 is abolished, and the\nfocus for PwC\u2019s graduate hunting is\nnow on an individual\u2019s impressive ability and extra-curricular activity. This\nseemingly opens the door for students\nwho look set to graduate with that\ndreaded lower second class honours\nonly.\nSonja Stockton, head of graduate recruitment for PwC, told the Financial\nTimes that whilst people didn\u2019t achieve\nthe normally-required 2:1, \u201cthey were\ndoing extraordinary and enterprising\nthings\u201d during their time at University\nthat may have compromised academic\nachievement, but still added value of\nemployability. An example cited was\nthe starting of a charity whilst studying.\nShe continued: \u201cWe wanted to create\nan opportunity and a window for exceptionally talented students who have\ndemonstrated exceptional achievements beyond the academic.\u201d\nThe move has been welcomed by\nmany at the best universities, where\nmany students find there is a fine balance between academically-achieving\nand fulfilling a recreational and interesting extra-curricular life. It is a balance that countless numbers of students at Imperial cannot find. Whilst\nthe ones that work on their degrees\nmore than they fill their CVs with anything else tend to be favoured, PwC can\nnow look forward to those students\nwho are arguably better equipped to\napply themselves to a wider variety of\nsituations and challenges.\nMs. Stockton highlighted their new\nrecruitment scheme also addressed\nthe inequality of standards and quality\nof a 2:1 degree across the UK\u2019s varying\nuniversities. She illustrated the point\nby interestingly singling out Imperial\nCollege students, claiming that they\nstood a worse chance of achieving that\ngold standard 2:1 than if they attended\na less reputable institution.\nMany other large graduate recruiters\nare following suit and are becoming\nincreasingly lenient on the 2:1 \u2018floor\u2019\nthat the majority of companies have\nimposed on their recruitment drives.\nUnilever, ones of Europe\u2019s leading\npharmaceutical companies, has stated\nthat graduates without a 2:1 \u201cwere not\nruled out\u201d completely. If they had \u201creally great work experience, drive, energy and commercial awareness\u201d things\ncould still look up for them.\nIt has been reported that in the last\nfew years that employers accepting\ngraduates on a 2:2 degree has risen,\ndespite the economic downturn skewing the market in favour of recruiters\nrather than job-hunters. A third of employers surveyed by the Association\nof Graduate Recruiters (AGR) in 2008\nwere said to be looking at applicants\nwith a 2:2, compared to a quarter the\nyear before.\nHowever, felix investigates if graduating from Imperial does make a dif-ference. Should Imperial graduates be\ngiven more slack from employers? Do\nemployers even notice the fact you\u2019re\nfrom the 5th best university in the\nworld? Does it even matter what degree classification you enter the big,\nwide world with?\n\u201cThe necessity of a 2:1 is\nabolished, and the focus\nfor PwC\u2019s graduate hunting\nis now on an individual\u2019s\nimpressive ability and extracurricular activity\u201d\nhas been the gold standard amongst\nthe vast majority of major graduate\nrecruiters. Many however have\nincreasingly started to recruit graduates\nwith a 2:2 in order to broaden a talent\npool beyond academic record.\nUpper Second (2:1)\nW\nith over 60% of graduates hitting the gold standard of a 2:1\nclassification or better, graduate recruiters are now having\na tough time sifting through the thousands\nof homogenous applications, even with a \u20182:1\nfloor\u2019 as part of preliminary requirements.\nIt has long been accepted that if you are not\nabove the 2:1 floor, you\u2019re simply not in the\nroom. Some might even say dead and buried\nin the ground. Puns and word play aside, companies like PwC and Ernst & Young are have\nstated that this 2:1 floor is \u201cflexible\u201d, and that\napplicants will now have to demonstrate other\nfeatures of their ability that go beyond an academic record.\nIntuitively, by dropping the requirements\nneeded for a job, the employers stand to receive even more applications than they do\nalready. However, by doing this they also\nbroaden the available talent pool and are able\nto recruit the applicants with skills and disciplines specific to their sector.\nCarl Gillead, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters pointed out the\npotential risks of using the tried and tested\nmethod of a 2:1 floor.\n\u201cThere is a growing awareness that graduates have other things to offer. If you use a\nhard and fast cut-off at 2:1 you might miss\nout,\u201d he said.\nSector-specific skills may not necessarily\ncome from achieving a 2:1. Even if some of\nthese skills can be attained during a certain\ndegree course, employers understand it is not\nguaranteed on courses at less reputable uni-versities. Rebecca Fielding, talent manager\nat HJ Heinz highlighted the suspected inequality in degree standards in British higher\neducation.\n\u2018The majority now have a first or 2:1,\u2019 she\ncorrectly states. \u2018Quality standards across\nuniversities and subjects are also completely\nincomparable, so the grade is not necessarily correlated to academic capability of the\ncandidate.\nJonathan Silver, Deputy President (Educa-tion) of Imperial College Union is in charge of\nrepresenting the academic needs of the College\u2019s students and agrees that this rings very\ntrue for graduates receiving their degrees from\nImperial.\n\u201cAt Imperial a 2.2 is not only perfectly re-spectable, it is arguably academically equivalent to at least an upper second from many institutions.\u201d He continues that highly-regarded\ninstitutions are almost impermeable to un-savoury tactics that are skewing the statistical surveys used by employers. He states that\n\u201cImperial is culturally opposed to the \u2018degree\ninflation\u2019 phenomenon, and there is no inclination among departments to align assessment standards with those from competing\ninstitutions, so assessment standards remain\nextremely high.\u201d\nMany institutions have been publically criticised for urging their academics to keep up\nwith targets in awarding upper class (1st or 2:1)\ndegrees to their students. In 2008, an email sent\nto the Mathematics department at Manchester\nMetropolitan University (MMU) was leaked\ninto the public. MMU are ranked 90th in the\nTimes Good University Guide 2010.\nMr. Silver compares the equivalent situation at Imperial, ranked 3rd in the same\nguide, where Imperial have set targets of 70%\nof students achieving a 2:1 or better, but only\n57% did so. \u201cIt is particularly noticeable with\nthe Mathematics BSc/MSci, where only 21%\nof graduates achieved a first class and 36%\nachieved an upper second class degree in\n2009, having enrolled in 2005/6 with AAB/\nAAA,\u201d he states.\nTalking to a Pricewaterhouse \u2013 Coopers\nGraduate Recruitment Advisor, she was certain in the fact that \u201cthe same standards still\napplied\u201d as before. The new scheme was more\nto focus on individuals who have \u201can amazing\nstory to tell\u201d, and less on the fact that any graduates with 2:2 degree could apply. Most inter-estingly, when questioned how much weight\nthe institution an applicant is graduating from\nholds on an application, she stated that whilst\nPwC looked at a full application completely,\nwhich university the graduate was from was\n\u201cnot particularly taken into consideration.\u201d\nInstead, the emphasis was seemingly still on\ntheir academic record.\nQuite clearly, the fact that PwC and other\ncompanies have begun to open up their programmes to applicants with a 2:2, he feels\nthere is still some way to go in reaching out to\nmany graduate recruiters who still use heavily\ndepend on degree classification only.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be necessary for a competent,\ninspired applicant with a 2.2 from Imperial to\nprove that they have done \u2018extraordinary and\nenterprising things\u2019. It would be more appropriate to adjust for the standards required for\neach degree class at Imperial. It is, sadly, true\nthat employers place far more emphasis on\nthe degree class achieved\nthan on the\nawarding institution,\u201d\nhe says.\nThe 2:1 Floor\nfelixOnline\nHow much\ndo you value\nan Imperial\ndegree?\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Three\nparts modesty, one part\nfear \u2013 this habit never gets\nshaken off when I play amateur journalist\nconducting interviews.\nSerendipity could never have laid out\nits path more celestially than it did on\nthe grim, January evening. Picking up\nthe envelope upon which my name was\nscrawled, I was still oblivious of the gravity of the invitation it contained.\nSimon Reeve\u2019s voice, once the mist of\nanxiety cleared, struck me as one immensely composed and calming. One I\nfeel comfortable to connect with. One\nthat won over my trust. The research\nflashed in reminiscence: for someone\nwhose travel portfolio contains visits to\n90 countries, who endured arrest for spying by the KGB and evaded the Moroccan\nsecret police, filmed in Burma, went on\na drug raid with a Mexican SWAT team\nand on patrol with the rebel-battling Indian army, drove through the world\u2019s largest\nminefield, witnessed trench warfare and\nhunted with the Bushmen of the Kalahari,\netcetera etcetera, he had not the slightest\nhint of arrogance and self-righteousness I\ndetest from many TV personalities.\nFresh off his odessey, where he circumnavigated the globe along the Tropic of\nCancer \u2013 a continuation and conclusion\nof a documentary trilogy that included\nEquator and Tropic of Capricorn \u2013 Simon is now promoting his latest pro-gramme, Tropic of Cancer, soon to be\nbroadcast on BBC2. Promises are pledged\nahead of its transmission \u2013 the first episode comes out this Sunday \u2013 that this\ndocumentary depicts his toughest and\nmost ambitious challenge yet.\nConveniently, this interview with my\nlatest extraordinaire may well be my\nmost ambitious challenge yet.\nDylan Lowe Tell us about your upcoming BBC documentary, Tropic of\nCancer.\nSimon Reeve It\u2019s a new documentary\nseries, the biggest and most ambitious\nchallenge I\u2019ve ever attempted in terms\nof the size and scale of our adventure,\nthe number of countries we\u2019ve visited in\nthe making of this series. With Tropic of\nCancer, I\u2019m following the line that marks\nthe northern border of the tropics region;\nfollowing it took me to eighteen coun-tries, starting in Mexico and travelling\nacross the Caribbean and North Africa,\nacross the Arabian peninsula to India,\nthen across South East Asia to Taiwan\nand hopping over the Pacific to the island\nof Hawaii, where I finished the journey\njust before Christmas and came home\nexhausted.\nDL That\u2019s probably more countries\nthan I\u2019ll ever go to in a lifetime.\nSR [Chuckles]\nDL As a spoiler, what would you ask\nyour audience to watch out for in\nyour documentary?\nSR The nature of the programmes I\nmake, or the style of this series and the\nother ones I\u2019ve done, is an attempt to\nblend travel with current affairs and issues that are affecting our world. We see\nthose issues playing out in the lives of,\nwell, often ordinary people around the\nplanet, whether it\u2019s a Bedouin tribesman\nin Southern Egypt on the frontline of climate change, or villages in Bangladesh\nalso experiencing the environmental impacts of climate change. We try to show\nour viewers the reality of life out there,\nso hopefully they\u2019ll tune in at any point\nof the series and learn something new\nabout our world, as well as seeing amazing landscapes and the joy that we experience when we travel around the planet.\nPicking out specifics: in the second\nprogramme in the series, I travelled from\nWestern Sahara \u2013 just the south of Morocco \u2013 through the most heavily land-mined area of the planet, into the desert\nof Mauritania, and then travelled through\nthe vast emptiness into Southern Algeria.\nAlong the way we learnt about the suffering of the Sahrawi people \u2013 natives of the\nterritory of Western Sahara which is now\noccupied by Morocco \u2013 and at the same\ntime we became some of the first foreigners for thirty years to travel the route we\ndid through Mauritania and into Algeria,\nwhich was fantastically remote and extraordinarily gorgeous. It was extremely\nmemorable.\nDL It sounds as though you\u2019ve been\nimmersing yourself into local cultures and the lives of people in the\nplaces you\u2019ve visited. How emotional\nit must have been. Any particularly\nsentimental moments?\nSR Absolutely. One particularly emotional moment was leaving Bangladesh,\nhaving spent nearly two weeks travelling\nacross the country, and being knocked\nsideways on how lush and beautiful it is\nas well as packed and desperately poor.\nAnd saying goodbye to Tanjil, my guide\nin Bangladesh, was quite an emotional\nfarewell. I was sad to leave, partly because\nI do fear that Bangladesh\u2019s biggest tragedies lie ahead of it, given the fact that it\u2019s\npancake flat and just above sea level, and\nwe were seeing some of the first effects\nof climate change as we were travelling\nacross it.\nAnother really emotional moment for\nme - it almost brings a lump to the throat\nremembering it \u2013 only happened a couple\nof months ago. We followed the Tropic\nof Cancer from North-eastern India into\n\u201cPolitics really\nmatters in countries\nlike Burma, rather\nthan the despised\nsport it is in the\nUK\u201d\na very remote part of Western Burma,\nin an area where the Chin people live. It\nwas something that hasn\u2019t been done by\nforeigners before, rather risky as well, as\nwe were going into an area where more\nthan fifty military bases are located. We\nwent in illegally and covertly to a local vil-lage, zip-lined across the river and trekked\nthrough the hills to a village of the Chin\npeople. It had been one hell of an adventure just to get to them. I already knew\nabout how the Chin people suffer under\nthe military regime there, but actually\nseeing these people \u2013 most of which have\nnever seen a foreigner before in their lives\n\u2013 and seeing them arm stretched and\nwelcoming us was a deeply moving mo-ment. Finding these forgotten people in\na forgotten part of the world was a huge\nprivilege. And very emotional.\nDL This reminds me of a documentary I was watching, about a team of\nBurmese journalists conducting illegal filming of the riots back in 2007\nand how they smuggled the clips out\nof the country.\nSR I think I know what you mean: they\nwere more in the urban areas working at\nextraordinary risk to themselves, filming on small cameras. If they are caught\nthey are likely to disappear \u2013 that is the\nregime that\u2019s in power there. When we\nwent to Burma we had a guide travelling\nwith us who is actually a fantastically\nbrave Chin young woman who now lives\nabroad in exile. She wanted to take us\nback into Burma at huge risks to herself,\nbecause she wanted the world to know\nwhat\u2019s going on there. Although, if we\nhad been caught by the authorities doing\nwhat we did, we would have been in huge\ntrouble, it would have been life-endingly\ncatastrophic for Cherry, our guide, who\nwas on a Burmese wanted list. Politics\nreally matters in countries like Burma,\nrather than the despised sport as it is\nin the UK. People are battling for their\nlives and their lives in Burma, and some\nof them are risking their necks to bring\nout news to rest of the planet, to put the\nworld into perspective.\nDL There must be a lot of things that\nhave gone on behind the scenes, the\nabrupt encounters when you haven\u2019t\nhad the opportunity to document on\na camera.\nSR Yes.

Days before he was appointed \u201cPresident of\nEurope\u201d he gave an audition speech\nto members of the secretive Bilderberg Group, of which only parts were\nreleased to the public. Now he is at\nit again. At last week\u2019s meeting of\nheads of government, when the crisis\nin Greece was high on the agenda, he\ncirculated another secret document,\nthis time calling for more central\nplanning of European economies by\nthe EU.\nAs the Associated Press (AP) got\nits hands on the \u201cunpublished document\u201d and revealed the gist of Van\nRompuy\u2019s proposals, it is easy to\nsee why he was so keen to keep his\nthoughts from the public.\nVan Rompuy is drawing up a blueprint for the way European countries\nmanage their economic affairs, proposing that the EU get involved in\nplanning national policies and ensuring they are carried out.\nIt is difficult to imagine in which\nEU capitals his proposals will be\nwarmly welcomed. The British and\nIrish, while not averse to cuts, claim\nto be opposed to any further surrender of sovereignty to Brussels. French\nvoters, for their part, are unlikely to\ntake kindly to Van Rompuy\u2019s demand\nthat worker protections should be\nslashed and that the EU should be\nable to limit spending on welfare and\npensions.\nVan Rompuy says, \u201cEurope can no\nlonger afford to pay generous pen-sions, health care and unemployment \u2014 the spending that, especially\nwith aging populations, has built up\nheavier and heavier levels of government debt, made worse by paying out\nhundreds of billions of euros to bail\nout banks and stimulate recession-plagued economies.\u201d\nThe AP says he has proposed a new\nsystem of \u201ceconomic governance\u201d,\nwhich would give Brussels more oversight into how member states run\ntheir budgets. This goes well beyond\nthe EU and European Central Bank\u2019s\ncurrent budgetary supervision; the\nECB\u2019s rule that deficits should never\nrise above 3 percent is routinely flouted by Eurozone members, including\nParis and Berlin.\nVan Rompuy proposes that the EU\ndraw up a set of five common economic targets, then tailor them for\nFollowing a policy paper by the EU president, Herman Van Rompuy, Neil Dhir questions what he is up to...\nThis\nweek\nBrown is a bully?\nFollowing the revelation that employees at 10 Downing Street had\ncomplained to an anti-bullying\nhelpline, the media has been\nrife with alegations that Gordon\nBrown bullies those he works\nwith. It has been reported for a\nwhile that the Prime Minister has\na fiery temper in private, and people on the opposite side to Brown\nin the Labour divide appear to\nthink of him as an autocrat. The\nChancellor, Alistair Darling, also\nreported that the Brown unleashed the \u201cforces of hell\u201d on him\nafter claiming the recession would be terrible back in 2008.\nConservatives try to buy votes\nGeorge Osborne, the Shadow Chancellor,\nhas announced a plan to give out a \u201cpeople\u2019s\nbonus\u201d by selling shares in state owned banks\nto the general public at a discounted price.\nThe Tories were instantly criticised for this as\na shameful attempt at buying votes. The current plan is to hold the shares until they can\nbe sold at a profit. The Conservative plan is to\nthrow away that profit by selling the shares\nat a low value. Currently RBS shares are trading at below book value so if people wanted\nto buy them at a discounted rate they could\nbasically do so now, rather than waiting for\nthe government to hold their hand (Note:\nthis should not be taken as financial advice).\neach country. EU experts would monitor the goals, which would be linked\nto EU funding and loans. Noncompliant governments may be \u201cnamed and\nshamed,\u201d which could affect their\nborrowing on bond markets.\nSome aspects of Van Rompuy\u2019s\nproposals have been guardedly wel-comed. The French and Germans are\ncurrently under centre-right governments (and Angela Merkel\u2019s position\ndepends on her coalition partners,\nthe free-market Free Democrats). As\nsuch, Van Rompuy\u2019s reality check on\npensions, health spending and welfare are not likely to be dismissed as\nthe rantings of a madman. Moreover,\nneither Merkel nor France\u2019s Nicolas\nSarkozy are ideologically opposed to\ngreater European integration. Britain\nhowever, with the likely inception of\nthe Conservative party as the government this spring, most certainly is.\nThe example of Greece, which allowed public spending to spiral out\nof control, has convinced many that\nmonetary union must be accompanied by economic and political union in a sacrifice of \u201csovereignty for\nstability\u201d.\nMany mainstream economists argue that Europe needs to liberalise\nits economy and slash spending on\nwelfare, though leftists claim that\nhigh benefits payments keep consumer markets afloat in the midst of\nrecessions.\nIndeed, Britain is one of Europe\u2019s\nproudest liberal economies, yet the\nrecession has outlasted that of left-leaning nations and our deficit - currently hovering at Greek levels - is one\nof the worst in Europe.\nThe problem is how to do it. Trade\nUnions and large numbers of ordinary workers strongly oppose any\nfurther slashing of Europe\u2019s welfare\nstate; governments fear anything\nfrom strike action to riots in opposition to the budgetary measures many\nbelieve are necessary.\nSome supporters of liberalisation in\nstates where spending is high actively support handing over budgetary\ncontrol to Brussels, much as British\nleft-wingers supported closer EU integration in the 1980s as a means of\nwresting control from the Thatcher\ngovernment.\nThe EU, it is reckoned, could take\nunpopular decisions that voters\nwould oppose. France has long used\nthe tactic of blaming Brussels when\nmaking necessary cuts; many French\nvoters oppose EU integration because\nthey see Brussels as a \u201cneoliberal\nplot.\u201d The President of Europe\u2019s proposals would confirm this. However,\nunder Van Rompuy, the EU appears\nto be offering itself as a scapegoat for\ncuts in exchange for greater control of\nbudgets.\nThis marks a shift in how Brussels\nwants to be perceived. For decades,\nthe European Union wondered why\nit was so unloved among Europe\u2019s\ntribes. It paid vast sums to propagandists and spent fortunes on public\nprojects in the hope that Eurosceptic\nsentiment might diminish if citizens\nsaw bridges and roads built with funds\nfrom Brussels. Yet it has never won\nthe public\u2019s affections and France, the\nNetherlands and Ireland have all rejected granted the EU greater powers\nin recent referenda.\nUnfortunately, post-Lisbon Treaty,\nthe age of referenda is over. The EU\u2019s\nleaders figure that they no longer\nhave to convince European citizens.\nInstead, integration can be pushed\nthrough from crisis to crisis.\nNicolas Veron of the Bruegel Institute, a Brussels-based economic\nthink-tank, says \u201cthe more crises you\nhave, the more you will have moments where you will have tradeoff of\nsovereignty.\u201d\nVan Rompuy himself says that the\nGreek crisis has \u201copened the window\nfor greater reform.\u201d\nPerhaps the EU\u2019s leaders believe\nthat the economic crisis will cow\nprotestors into submitting to its economic governance. There may be a\nfeeling that while governments are\noften the target of protests and activ-ists, the EU is seen to be too diffuse\nand distant to become the subject of\na Europe-wide campaign.\nThe resistance to these \u201creforms\u201d is\nlikely to be felt in the streets, not least\nbecause not one of the heads of government who convened in Brussels\nlast week felt the need to protest when\nthe President put this unpublished\npaper before them. A note of caution\nthough Europeans are nothing if not\nmasters of throwing off Empires.\nThese are strange days. Lisbon enshrined constant upheaval as the\nconstitutional status of EU states; the\nfinancial crisis has made the continent\u2019s economic future and the livelihoods of its citizens appear very\nbleak indeed. Europeans are subjected to more surveillance and scrutiny\nthan ever before, while being ever\nmore exposed to the vagaries of globalised power and commerce. Crisis\nafter crisis: The perfect moment for\nrevolution.\nThe only problems is that most people who care nowadays are mostly\narmchair-generals.\n\u201cThe EU... could\ntake unpopular\ndecisions that\nvoters would\noppose\u201d\n\u201cEurope can no\nlonger affford\nto pay generous\npensions,\nhealth care and\nunemployment\u201d\n\n"

It may sound harsh,\nbut I don\u2019t care if the poor sod is at\ndeath\u2019s door, especially if it involves\nyou describing his last meal and what\nit looked like coming out the other\nend. Ever been aurally assaulted by\nsomeone else\u2019s painfully private mobile phone conversation on a bus? I\ntake the rush hour bus to and from my\nhome every weekday and this, coupled\nwith the London Transport network\u2019s\nplentiful population of eccentrics, has\nexposed me to some of the strangest\nconversations I will probably ever hear.\nIt seems like it was only a few years\nago that you could take a bus or sit in\na restaurant without being battered on\nall sides by other people\u2019s one-sided\nconversations on phones. That period\nof our existence ended when mobile\nphones really began to take off - the\ngood old days when people thought\nthat yelling down a telephone line\nhelped the message through to the other end. Yet in those days, it was only the\nself-important businessmen who could\nafford to shout their way down Oxford\nStreet, and the nuisance was ignorable\nsimply because not enough of us had\nthe devices for it to be noticeable.\nThat all changed with the emergence\nof cheap monthly plans with free min-utes. Buses on weekday mornings are a\ncacophony of ringing phones and muddled bits of conversation. \u201cTell him I\u2019m\ngoing to be late, I\u2019ve been stuck in traffic for over an hour now\u201d - lies, I just\nsaw you get on the bus. Also, lady with\nthe bag sticking uncomfortably into\nmy back? I don\u2019t care if \u201cno one is single anymore except for you\u201d - I do care\nthat you\u2019ve been talking continuously\nfor the last half hour, while standing\nright behind me. The fact is, you would\nnever have these loud private conversations in public before, even if you\nwere with someone else, and you definitely wouldn\u2019t have an argument with\nyour mother to entertain the medley\nof students, tourists and lunatics that\nmake up your average London bus.\nThe other, obvious, side to the argument is - why should I be listening in\nthe first place? These things don\u2019t matter to me, and I somehow manage to\ndrown out real conversations - why\ncan\u2019t I just do the same here and forget about it? In a recent study by the\nUniversity of York, researchers found\nthat people pay more attention when\nthey can only hear one side of a con-versation. It may be that our brains\nget a kick out of trying to complete a\nconversation having only heard half of\nit, or that the drone of a full conversation is easier to push into the background than the stop-and-go nature of\na mobile chat, but whatever the reason,\nthese conversations grate on our ears\nmuch more than normal ones.\nI think that the Japanese have the\nright idea when it comes to mobile\nphone usage in public places - it\u2019s a\ncultural taboo. With their habits usually leading the rest of the world when\nit comes to technology, it might not be\nlong before we see notices advising us\nnot to answer phones on the bus. In\nGermany too, mobile phones are serious business; a man was murdered\nthere in 1999 for his poor mobile eti-quette. That said, we might also go the\nSpanish way. To quote The Economist\nabout phone vs. face-to-face conver-sations: \u201csubscribers in Madrid often\nmixed them and even allowed others\nto take part in their phone conversations\u201d. I\u2019d rather walk.\nT\nhis week saw the accidental\nbirth of a new internet meme\nat the expense of some rather\nignorant Facebook users.\nI say some, it\u2019s more like thousands\nof Stalkerbook simpletons, and it all\nstems from their inability to understand a simple principle: Google is a\nsearch engine, not an address bar.\nHow do you, dear reader, get to Facebook? Type in Facebook.com in your\naddress bar? Yes, thought you might.\nBut a small percentage of Facebook users actually search for \u2018Facebook login\u2019\nevery time they want to get to the social networking giant. Now a small\npercentage it may be, but because of\nthe sheer number of users Facebook\nactually has, that actually equates to\nliterally thousands of users.\nOf course there\u2019s nothing wrong\nwith searching for something you go\nto regularly, other than the extra step\nit requires I guess, but to blindly click\non the first or second result it turns up\nwithout actually looking at the url it\u2019s\nsending you to is pure idiocy. I often\nwonder who falls for phishing scams,\nand now I know, it\u2019s the mental underachievers that think they\u2019re web-savvy\nbut blatantly aren\u2019t.\nReadWriteWeb is a site dedicated to\nweb apps and technologies behind the\ninternet. They wrote up an interesting\narticle about how Facebook might end\nup being your universal login for everything you might do on the web, spurred\non by the recent AOL-Facebook part-nership. Of course a web-savvy site like\nRWW has pretty good SEO, meaning\nthat their post about a universal Facebook login hit all the right keywords\nto propel it up the search rankings for\nanyone searching Google for \u2018Facebook\nlogin\u2019. Unbeknownst to them this put\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week has been and\ngone, but what have we got to\nshow for it from the world of\ntechnology?\nHow about the latest in Japanese Granny-scooter technol-ogy, the Personal Hoverchair?\nYes, that\u2019s right, not content\nwith the mobility scooters you\nsee OAPs flying around on in\ntown centres, researchers from Japan\u2019s Kobe\nGakuin University\nhave bolted a high-power air jet\nto the bottom\nof a chair. Itblasts air\ndownwards\ncreating, in-effect, a personal\nhovercraft. It only works on\nsmooth surfaces but they\u2019d be\nat home in a mall. Maybe Paul\nBart - Mall Cop 2 will have one\nof these bad boys instead of the\nso last century Segway?\nNot to be out done by the\nJapanese, the South Koreans\nwere in the news this week\ntoo with the announcement\nthat robot teachers will be invading up to 400 pre-schools\nby 2012. The \u2018R-Learning\u2019\nprogram should expand into\naround 8000 pre-schools and\nkindergartens by the following year. Of course the Rise of\nthe Machines should follow by\nabout 2015 so maybe it\u2019s time\nto start stocking up on guns\nand ammo.\nSamsung got in on the robo-action too this week with their\nNavibot robot vacuum, which\nwill be gracing European living rooms from March. Having\nbeen let out of South Korea,\nthe little housewife replacement maps out your humble\nabode with 30fps video, plotting the most efficient route\nto clean up that mess from last\nnights \u2018lads night in\u2019 beer and\ngaming session. Watch out\nRoomba, looks\nlike you\u2019ve\nfinally\ngot\nsome\ndecent\ncompeti-tion.\nTalking about products\naround the home, have you\never wished for lights that you\ncan just stick flat on the walls\naround corners, or that you\ncould change the colour of at\nthe flick of a switch? Well flexible OLED lighting might be the\nkey to that dream. ModisTech,\namongst others, is bringing\n150mm square OLED panels\nto market this year for indirect\nlighting applications in lamps,\ncars and other places where\nLEDs or bulbs are used. OLED\nlighting promises more natural\nlight than can be achieved with\nLEDs alone, whilst maintaining their power sipping prop-erties. Great for the green folks\nas well as car modders and\npeople with fancy lighting in\ntheir kitchens.\nMicrosoft has been in the\nnews again this week with updates to its Windows 7 activation technology. Not sure how\nlong it\u2019s going to last so by the\ntime you read this it might already be circumvented. Game\non hackers.\nMicrosoft also pushed out\nits EU pleasing browser ballot screen this week. It\u2019s been\nquite a while since the EU\nstuck its oar in, but starting\nthis week you should be\nable to select between\nIE, Safari, Chrome,\nFirefox and Opera.\nOf course if you\nhaven\u2019t already made\nthe choice to ditch\nIE, you\u2019re not going\nto now, so you\u2019ll just\nfind it an annoyance which you\ncan thank the European Commission for.\nSony this week got a lot of\ncamera geeks salivating with\ntheir Alpha compact DSLR\nhybrid concept. With the size\nand body of a compact coupled\nto the interchangeable lenses\nand sensor from a DLSR, it\nsure sounds like Sony wants\nin on the fledgling Micro Four\nThirds market.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs\nA Fistful of\nFacebook dimwits\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nthe post squarely in the firing line of\nall those Bookface geniuses that search\nfor \u2018Facebook login\u2019 each time, sending\nthousands of confused Facebookers\nto RWW producing hilarity and utter\nstupidity along the way.\nPretty soon the blog comments\nstarted pouring in with frustrated users complaining that Facebook had\n\u2018changed\u2019. Here\u2019s a few choice ones:\n1. \u2018The new facebook sucks>\nNOW LET ME IN.\u2019\n2. \u2018I WANT THE OLD FAFEBOOK BACK THIS SHIT IS\nWACK!!!!!\u2019\n3. \u2018I was just learning,why\nwould you mess it up?\u2019\n4. Why couldn\u2019t you just leave\nwell enough alone!!!\nOf course this state of affairs prompted RWW to stick a large block text sign\nin the middle of the post telling the\nconfused Facebookers that \u2018This site\nis not Facebook\u2019, but even that didn\u2019t\nseem to stem the flow of cretins.\nSoon the tech community got wind\nof this phenomenon prompting it to\nspread across Digg, Reddit, Twitter\nand blogs like wild-fire, causing another deluge of visitors and commenters,\nthis time ripping the absolute piss out\nof the now irate Facebook numpties.\nAt that point it was clear, this was the\nbirth of a new internet meme, completely by accident, but absolutely hilarious nonetheless. Now, I hope none\nof you reading this fit into the \u2018George\nW Bush\u2019 class of Facebookers, but if\nyou are one of them I suggest quickly\nturning the page.

There were three golds,\ntwo silvers and two bronzes, as well as\nseveral other top ten placings.\nMost students doubled and even\ntripled up in crews, racing down the\n5km head course against the stream on\nPeterborough\u2019s Nene River in snowy\nconditions.\nAfter being cancelled due to bad\nweather last year, it was with great\ntrepidation that a poor forecast was\npredicted over the weekend. Luckily,\ncoach Stuart Whitelaw\u2019s years of experience knew how to motivate a squad\nin the face of such conditions; \u201cBe prepared for a long day in cold, damp conditions with very few facilities within\nwalking distance.\u201d Off the back of such\ninspiration the novice squad set the\nball rolling in style on Saturday claiming a bronze medal in the MB8+.\nThe crew were split into fours for the\nsecond division racing as coxed boats.\nIC A performed well placing 5th, while\nIC B became the victims of a Southampton cox who veered into the crew\nlosing them valuable time. They settled\nfor 14th.\nOn Sunday morning the senior men\u2019s\ncrews awoke to a snow-covered Peterborough and were still reeling from the\ninjury of Henry Goodier the previous\nday in a practice paddle.\nBoat Club shore up 106 BUCS points in one weekend\nChristina Duffy Rowing\nCould you think of a better way to earn BUCS points for your university? Didn\u2019t think not. Hypothermia\u2019s in for 2010.\nIt was the lightweight squad who\nbrought home the bacon, winning gold\nin the LM4x and collecting silver in\nthe LM4-. Drama had unfolded earlier back at the hotel when it was discovered that the weighing scales had\nbeen forgotten resulting in a very light\nbreakfast for the paranoid crew.\nThe first division bore the brunt of\nthe bad weather with hypothermia\nclaiming another BUCS athlete who\nhad to be rescued from his boat. This\nresulted in all other crews having to\nwait in the heavily falling snow.\nThe MC4+ were stranded for over\n45 minutes and according to Bellion,\nbowman Andy Gordon was horrified:\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s like the coldest thing ever. I\ncan\u2019t do this for much longer.\u201d Gordon\nwas so traumatised by the whole experience that the quad in the second division had to scratch.\nMeanwhile Alex Gillies was causing\na fuss at not being allowed to race in\nskins. Despite the cold the MC4+ managed a solid bronze. Steele is alleged to\nhave informed a slightly concerned\nBellion that: \u201cI loved stroking you.\u201d\nWhen asked about it later Bellion was\nadamant: \u201cThe pleasure was all his.\u201d\nThe MC8+ placed fifth in 15:31 behind winners Oxford Brookes while\nthe MI8+ finished fourth, also behind\na winning Oxford Brookes crew. The\nMC4+ had packed their cans of Whoopass as requested and took gold in\n16:45 ahead of Reading in 17:07.\nWith only 5 Imperial students in the\nwomen\u2019s squad it was only possible to\nenter two boats, of which both med-alled. The result of the day went to the\nWC4+ who won their event in 19:38,\n01:26 ahead of Nottingham Trent who\ntook silver. This was also faster than\nthe winning WC4- (Cardiff: 19:42).\nThe WC4x took silver behind a\nstrong Durham crew. Staying in peak\nphysical condition to ward off possible\nseat threats has taken its toll on Christina Duffy who will be wearing her yet\nto arrive medals for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nAt the end of the day ICBC scored\n106 BUCS points for Imperial (third\noverall) behind Reading (115) and\nDurham (130). ICBC continues to edge\ncloser to the top ranked university and\nlooks forward to a successful season\noff the back of these strong results.\n\n"

    "content": "their Bottle match and so need as\nmuch practice as possible, the C&G\nand the RCS are the perfect opponents\nto play. Similarly the RCS need their\npractice for the Oxford game and as for\nthe Guilds, well they just like playing a\ngame of glamorous rugby before retiring to the bar. Before any of you start\nthinking that the Guilds don\u2019t take\ntheir rugby as seriously as the other\ntwo, in recent times they started their\nown rivalry, this one against the Paris\nInstitute of Technology.\nAs a quick side note, have a look at\nthe following Live! story (http://live.\ncgcu.net/sport/rugby/127). where you\nwill find that not only did the Medical School managed to lose the United Hospitals Cup in 2001, but they\nalso managed to lose to the Guilds in\nfriendly match at Teddington. I\u2019ll be\nhonest here, I seriously doubt if the\nMedicals put out their 1st XV for this\ngame, but a win is a win!\nThe Sparkes Cup is one of the few\ncompetitions that still exists to this\nday, with the RSM beating the Guilds\nteam earlier in the year and with the\nRCS team failing to get enough players\nfor the game against the Guilds (this\ncounts as a Guilds win in my books!!!).\nAlthough the Imperial College Rugby\nClub is now the main focus of rugby\nat the college, taking up a considerable\namount of time, the students still find\nthe time for some inter-faculty rivalry and the chance to try off some\nmoves that they wouldn\u2019t dare try\nin front of the Imperial Coaches.\nLong may the glamour, flair and\ncamaraderie of the Sparkes Cup\nremain.\ncompeting on the rugby field for the\nhonour of their mining school. In 1926\na certain group of ambitious mining\nstudents decided to \u2018borrow\u2019 a 3 foot\ntall tin beer bottle from the top of a\nBass lorry on which they adorned both\nsets of crests and it has since then been\nthe symbol of the event, and the trophy\nfor the winner of the rugby match\nAlthough not as intense as the Bottle Match, the Royal College of Science\nhas its own annual match, with the\nclub travelling every year to Keble College in Oxford for some light-hearted\nrugby followed by a night out in Oxford. Even though the other two faculty teams didn\u2019t have such an intense\nrivalry with another club as the RSM\ndid with Cambourne, each club strived\nto perform well in their respective\nleagues, however, as is always the case,\nthere was competition between each\nFaculty to find out who was the best.\nThis is where the Sparkes Cup came in.\nLooking through the archive, it\nseemed that rugby was very different\nback then, the obvious conclusion being that the scores were very low, take\nthis 1950\u2019s game between the RCS and\nthe RSM:\n\u201cThe R.C.S. pack led by Smith and\namongst whom black bearded Hague\nwas prominent, completely subdued the Mines pack, but having\ngained possession of the ball little\nelse was done. Although on paper the\nR.C.S. backline is the most\npowerful of the three\ncolleges they\nE\nveryone knows, or at least\nwill know by within the\nnext few weeks, that every\nyear the Imperial School of\nMedicine take on the rest\nof the College in the annual Varsity\nMatches. The culmination will be the\nJPR Williams Cup between the two 1st\nXV sides in front of a packed crowd.\nFor the rugby clubs at least, this is one\nof their biggest matches and the recent\nscore lines will testify to it, but what\nwas it like before the JPR Williams Cup\nfor the Club. The simple answer is the\nSparkes Cup.\nStanley Robert Sparkes joined the\nCivil Engineering Department in 1934\nas a Demonstrator, in Structures, and\nworked his way through academic appointments to become Professor of\nStructural Engineering in 1958. As well\nas being Dean of the City and Guilds\nCollege between 1964-1967, he was\nalso the President of the Imperial College Football Club, and it is after him\nthat the competition get\u2019s its name.\nAlthough the College was founded\nin 1907, the constituent College\u2019s had\nexisted before then and subsequently,\nso had some of their sports clubs. The\nCity and Guilds College, for example,\nwhich was founded in 1876 has had a\nrugby club since 1898 and the club still\nexists to this day.\nRugby is one of those sports that you\ncan\u2019t really get away from. Like rowing\nand football, it is an integral part of any\nschoolboy\u2019s life, or at least it was back\nin the day, with the individual making\nthe choice really early one, some times\nnot really deciding on one, but all\nthree. It therefore makes sense that as\nthe individual progresses through the\neducational system, these clubs would\nexist at the higher education level and\nwhy there is always a lot of history.\nAt the start of the century, each\nclub used to focus on its own\nseason and they developed\ntheir own rivalries; take the\nRoyal School of Mines\nand their Bottle Match\nagainst the Cambourne School of\nMines which\nwill take place\nthis weekend.\nFor 108\nyears they\nhave\nbeen\nSports of Yesteryear: Sparkes Cup\nHistory of College\nRugby:\nKey\nRoyal School of Mines\nCity and Guilds\nRoyal College of Science\nlacked the thrust necessary to take\nthem over the line.\nEdward\u2019s sound kicking was a great\nasset to the Mines too, on the few occasions when they had the ball were uncertain as to what to do. The only score\nof the match came halfway through the\nsecond half when a loose pass between\nthe Mines halves allowed Jacobson to\nswoop in to score close to the post with\nCoppleman converting.\u201d\nAs the years went on and the importance of the Imperial rugby club\ngrew, this competition, unlike\nsome of its contemporar-ies, has managed to lasted the test of time and it\nis still being played to\nthis day. And why\nshouldn\u2019t it!\nThe RSM\nare still\nplaying\n\u201cIn 1926 some\ncreative Miners\ndecided to \u2018borrow\u2019\na 3ft tall tin beer\nbottle, this became\nThe Bottle\u201d\nFrom the ring in the Union to the green fields of Harlington, Jovan Nedi\u0107 looks at Faculty rugby\nThe Guilds rugby team on one of their glamorous attacks\n1902:\nThe first game\nbetween the RSM\nand the Cambourne\nSchool of Mines is\nplayed\n1926:\nCreative Miners\u2019\n\u2018borrow\u2019 a 3ft tin\nbeer bottle which\neventually became\nThe Bottle\n37\nfelix FRIDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2010\nFEATURE\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n2000:\nSomehow, the\nGuilds Rugby team\nmanage to beat\nthe Medicals in a\nfriendly game at\nTeddington\n2006:\nRoyal School of\nMines win The\nBottle Match for a\nhistoric 10th year in\na row\n1920\n1930\n1940\n1950\n1960\n1970\n1980\n1990\n2000\n2010\n1934:\nStanley Robert\nSparkes, whom the\ncompetition was\nnamed after, joins\nthe Civil Engineering\nDepartment,\neventually becoming\nDean of the City\nand Guilds College\nand President of the\nImperial Rugby Club\n\n"

The advertising was intense; emails, posters,\n5000 flyers and frequent badgering by\nmembers of the Biosoc Committee,\nshowed all other clubs how to properly advertise an event and shattered\nthe myth that Imperial students are\napathetic. The main attraction was the\nstar list of speakers, whose comments\nI have tried to report faithfully below.\nTolstoy said \u2018every man thinks about\nchanging the world, but no man thinks\nof changing himself.\u2019 Climate Change\nis a problem we must solve somehow,\nbut whether that is by new technology,\nchanging the world, or lifestyle change,\nchanging ourselves, is a question on the\nmind of every environmentalist. And\nso we came to the Clore lecture theatre\nlast Wednesday to hear some leading\nexperts debate that very subject.\nThe event was chaired by Richard\nBlack, the chief environmental journalist at the BBC. After beginning\nwith a warning that many people have\nstarted to question the science of Climate Change, he introduced perhaps\nthe most famous speaker, Sir Brian\nHopkins, a member of the Government\u2019s Climate Change Committee\nand Director of Imperial\u2019s Grantham\nInstitute for Climate Change. He began by echoing Richard\u2019s warning that\npublic doubt about anthropogenic Climate Change is increasing and briefly\nexplained the science, just in case anyone in the audience was in doubt. His\ntag-line was that championed by many\nclimate scientists and politicians, that\nthe issue isn\u2019t \u2018if\u2019 climate change is happening or not, but by \u2018how much\u2019.\nProbably the most impressive example he gave, and one that made quite\nan impression on me, was a map of\nthe world showing how temperatures\nfor January were higher or lower than\nusual. Northern Europe, which experienced the cold snap recently that we\nall will remember, showed blue and\npurple, and yes it had been colder than\nusual. The rest of the world though\nwas green and yellow, showing higher\ntemperatures than normal for January. No cold snaps for them. And yet\nthe cold snap has done much to raise\nglobal warming scepticism in the UK.\nThis shows exactly why this is a global\nissue.\nHis contribution to the debate was\nto point out that people need it made\neasy when they want to personally\ntackle their contribution to Climate\nChange, and is it technology which\ncan make it easier, as efficiency con-tributions, cited as a major measure to\ntackle warming, are only growing at 2%\nper year compared to a 5% growth in\naviation.\nThe second speaker was Malachi\nChadwick, campaign coordinator for\nthe 10:10 campaign. The campaign,\nlaunched last year, wants each signatory to reduce their carbon footprint by\n10% by the end of 2010; individuals or\nwhole businesses can sign up to it. He\nwas quick to point out that small personal contributions do make a difference to fighting Climate Change and\ngives people a sense of empowerment.\nPointing to the bottled water on the table he asked us where he could get tap\nwater, showing that every choice has\nconsequences, and that the responsibility to reduce our impact on the environment lies with us as individuals.\nHe admitted though that it can be\nhard to see how you can make a personal difference, as you can be overwhelmed by the global situation. \u2018In\na few minutes of me speaking,\u2019 he de-clared, \u2018gas flaring will produce more\ngreenhouse gases than I will for the\nrest of my life.\u2019\nHis assessment of the Copenhagen\ntalks in December were that they were\na complete failure and that a conference which could have inspired so\nmuch and led to so much investment\nin new technology was merely cheap\ntalk. He looks forward to the Mexico\ntalks next year but added to Sir Brian\u2019s\npoint about making it easy for people\nto act against Climate Change in that\nit has to be made easy for politicians to\nact as well. And this can only be done\nby showing public support for decar-bonisation, which is exactly what the\n10:10 campaign does.\nThe Director of the Energy Futures\nLab at Imperial, Professor Nigel Brandon, was the next speaker and gave the\nenergy perspective on the debate. He\nbegan with the point that energy infrastructure needs replacing anyway, and\nso now is the perfect time to replace it\nwith low-carbon alternatives.\nWorldwide $22tn must be invested\nin the energy infrastructure by 2030,\nincluding the UK replacing a third of\nits capacity, and this is a tremendous\nchance for renewal. He pointed out\nthat \u2018the UK is more fossil energy dependent than China\u2019 getting 90% of its\nenergy from fossil fuels, mostly for the\nproduction of heat.\nThe final speaker was Doug Parr, the\nChief Scientific Advisor for Greenpeace. He was overall more optimistic than I imagined someone from\nGreenpeace would be, saying that the\nUK was good at International talk and\nwe must pursue this route even after\nCopenhagen.\nHe was positive that the UK could\nmake the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy but warned that this must\nbe without the use of nuclear power\ninvestment as it crowds out other renewable methods of energy genera-tion, which can fill the energy gap on\ntheir own. This prompted a response\nfrom Professor Brandon who casually\ninserted a plug for the nuclear research\ndone by the Energy Futures Lab. Doug\nmade his main point that lifestyle and\nengineering are interdependent and\nwill back each other up. All that we\nneed are initiatives to make it easy\nfor people to make a difference and\nleadership by Government, who he\nsays must change if individuals are to\nchange.\nThe 10 minute speeches were followed by questions from the packed\nClore lecture theatre. Questions\nranged from defence of the carbon\nfootprint of Dubai to declarations supporting both sides of the debate. Many\npeople in the audience supported\ntechnology over lifestyle change and it\neven came to light that Imperial is one\nof the few Universities in the Russell\nGroup not to sign up to 10:10.\nMr Black closed the debate and\nthanked the speakers who led the\ncharge to the foyer where wine and\nfood was waiting. The event was masterfully pulled off and ran without a\nhitch. The audience were engrossed in\nthe discussion and the general feeling\nwas that both lifestyle change and new\ntechnology are needed to combat Climate Change.\nIf this can be appreciated then surely\nImperial is the right place to be to really make a difference.\nWith the mass of information on\nhow to change your individual impact\non the planet available, and a host of\ncourses teaching the best in how to develop new technologies, we are truly in\nthe place to change ourselves and the\nworld.\n\u2018Imperial is one of\nthe few Universities\nin the Russell group\nnot to sign up to the\n10:10 campaign.\u2019\n\u2018The UK is more fossil energy dependent\nthan China, getting\n90% of its energy\nfrom fossil fuels.\u2019\nClimate Change Committee member\nA full hall turned out to discuss whether lifestyle or engineering can save us from ourselves, writes Alex Kendall\nBrian Hoskins, and also of Imperial\nChief Scientist for Greenpeace Mr\nDoug Parr - doesn\u2019t like nuclear\n10:10 campaign coordinator\nMalachi Chadwick\nDirector of the Energy Futures Lab\n\u2018Pointing to the bottled water on the ta-ble, he asked where\nto get tap water.\u2019\nThis is a picture of the Chief Scientific advisor for Greenpeace pouring himself a\nglass of bottled water. Greenpeace\u2019s website says that people should stop using\nbottled water. Talk is cheap.\nProfessor Nigel Brandon\n\n"

The game is down to\nthe duo and Mary Katrantzou. Some\ntoned down pieces such as an elegant\nswooped line body-con dress worn\nwith print leggings. Albeit not many\nsurprises here, still a good collection.\nHuggable as marshmallow and elegant\nas swans, Shao-yen Chen, an MA\ngraduate of CSM has created a stunningly beautifully knit collection. Raffia exploded in amazing volume and\nin ripples of tranquil layers that curve\naround the body. 10 stars. Absolutely.\nThey have definitely lost it. A collection\ninspired by the immaculate 80s and the\nclothes look dirty and untidy. Random\nfur trims that resemble mice peeking\nout from a pile of unwanted items in a\ncharity shop. The only desirable item\nwas a pair of open toe vagina boots that\nare made out of rings of strings.\nSHAO-YEN\nCHEN\nSWAN\n**********\nJONATHAN\nSAUNDERS\nDIGITAL\nAPOCALYPSE\n*****\nBURBERRY\nPRORSUM\nONE SHEEP\nTWO SHEEPS\nTHREE...\n******\nMARY\nKATRANZOU\nDANGEROUS\nLIASON\nLUXURIOUS\nPETER\nPILOTTO\nGYPSIE X\nTRAMP\n********* **\nQueen Victoria\u2019s many household objects printed on immaculate dresses.\nEpaulettes so vivid that you almost\nthink they are real. 2D surrealism was\ngradually replaced by explosive layers\nof lace and ruffles of printed fabrics.\nYou can almost hear the printed pearls\nrattle. Awesome.\nThink golden leaves falling in a setting\nsun. Think seasonal birds flying across\na maroon sky. Think snowflakes falling in a romantic Swedish woods. The\npoignant images were embroidered\nonto bell-shaped dresses. All very\nmademoiselle-esque. Beautiful.\nNathan Jenden has done extremely\nwell for himself after quitting DVF\non Valentine\u2019s Day. A hybrid of serious boardroom uniform and (skin of)\nsafari animals. Kaleidoscopic monochrome makes your head spin. He even\nmade snood-hoods elegant! Alternative power dressing.\nERDEM\nBREAK OF\nDAWN AND\nFALLING\nLEAVES\n*******\nThe strategic placed holes are revamped with a wider range of colours.\nAdd sangria/rose etc to the wish list.\nMark has diverged into draped poncho in mandarin cinched with a thin\nleather belt \u2013 Dalai Lama in tailored\nwinter wear.\nMARK FAST\nDALAI LAMA\nIN EXPENSIVE\nKNITWEAR\n*****\nANJA MLAKAR\nCHOP YOUR\nHANDS\nTHROUGH THE\nTECHNO AIR\n******\nThe figure hugging persian blue dresses\nhave hidden hoola-hoops underneath.\nAnja has sewn an eclectic edge onto\nthe traditional crinoline dresses. The\nbeautifully structured dresses are reminiscent of the techno pieces sold in Cyberdog. Only more elegant.\nChristopher Bailey battles UGG to become the biggest endorser of sheepskin.\nDeranged fur lined buckle boots. Aviator jackets lined with 2-inch thick of\nsheepskin. Humungous pea coat in bear\nfur that would dwarf Andre Leon Talley.\nBurberry \u2013 the shop for coats in 2011.\nHole punched dresses ala the IBM\npunched card for a calculator that\nRichard Feynman used to design the\nA-bomb. The dresses are precisely\ncut with laser. The blockey panelled\ncollection emulates the sombre mood\nof the digital apocalypse. Jonathan\nmade windbreakers desirable.\nTopshop\nUnique\nDavid\nKoma\nMary\nKatrantzou\nTodd\nLynn\nS\ntarting with David Koma,\nthe scene was set for a\nvery geometric, monochromatic Autumn/Winter season. As seems to be\nhis speciality, Koma chose\na theme, zig-zag patterning, and followed it through his entire collection\nwith varying success. Set in a palette of\nblack, nude and gold, the spiky, body-con, futuristic-inspired collection\nsomewhat echoed his last, pushing the\ntheme perhaps a little too far for an\nentire collection although individually\nthe pieces looked well-made, thoughtful and imaginative, with leather and\nsuede breaking up the wool base to\ncreate some textural interest. Expectations were high for this designer who\ncatapaulted to success last year and\nperhaps we expected more, but I\u2019m\nsure many of his celebrity fans will be\ndelighted with a piece from this collection as the cuts are flattering and\nwearer-friendly.\nBodyamr also showed at Vauxhall\nFashion Scout, with a celebrity-heavy\nfront row complete with Rachel Stevens, Nicola Roberts and Hilary Alexander. The designer, Amr Ali, continued to showcase his vision of women\nas \u201csexually empowered warriors\u201d with\na variation of cutting techniques, from\nhis signature draping to body conscious mini-dresses. Colour was kept\nminimal but interesting with ombr\u00e9\neffects and screen printing of draping\ncreating a trompe l\u2019oeil print for some\nof the dresses. The eveningwear was\nindeed empowering, Greek goddess\nlike and beautiful \u2013 plus, the models\nwere \u201cnormal-sized\u201d with womanly\nMarilyn curves and walks full of attitude and power.\nOver at the BFC Show Space, Sass\nand Bide kept it geometric and monochrome but with much more complex\npatterning and prints, and with that\nsignature sexy bohemian chic. Featuring cutouts and emphasis on strong\nshoulders adorned with metallic fabrics or fur, the fabrics were kept tactile\nand sensual with lace and cotton jersey\nhugging each curve (read: bone) of the\nmodels. The outfits were beautifully\naccessorised with tribal printed mini-capes with feather fringing and opera-length fingerless leather gloves, and\nthere were harnesses seen everywhere,\neither featuring within the frame of the\ngarment or over it, often in leather, giving the collection a sexy hard edge, despite the minimal colour palette.\nPPQ also kept their colour story to\na minimum \u2013 set completely in black\nand gold, the collection was all about\ntexture \u2013 the black tones were varied in\nvelvet, thick wool felt and silk and the\ngold was kept whimsical in touches of\ngold leather, lam\u00e9 and weaved through\ngold brocade. Perhaps their designs are\na little simplistic by some standards\n\u2013 luckily the show was at 8.30pm on\nSaturday, the fash-pack weren\u2019t going\nto be picky about the nuances of cut\nand fit \u2013 but PPQ have cornered the\nmarket on easy-to-wear party dresses\nfor the young and beautiful\u2026 Although\nwithout the gold touches the finale\nmay have seemed no more than a well-groomed parade of ex-groupies at a\nrock star\u2019s funeral.\nColour was lacking again at Todd\nLynn, but this time nobody could have\ncared less: the silhouettes were so\nbeautiful and the menswear so wonderful that even the queens on the\nfront row were rendered speechless.\nJackets with fabulously exaggerated\npagoda shoulders were draped in sinfully sumptuous fox fur and served as\na means to describe his inspiration:\nthe hunter becomes the hunted. Cage\nsymbolism came in the form of woven\nleather and also adorned the shoulders\nof the elf-like models (did he pick them\non how pointy their ears were? Who\nknows.) A wonderful collection in simple shades of oatmeal and black which\nI wouldn\u2019t mind getting my mits on.\nSimilarly, Topshop Unique showed a\nnaturalistic collection careering from\na relatively restrained khaki boy-scout\nuniform through distressed leather\nand shearling coats to the thickest,\nlongest, cosiest knitwear layered over\n\u201c...next winter,\nkeep it classically\nmonochrome...\nunless you\u2019re\nbrave enough\nfor a maximalist\nKatrantzou look...\u201d\nMary Katrantzou was inspired by the\nopulence of 18th century France.\n\n"

So to\nkeep you entertained, snuggle under\nthe duvet with this week\u2019s felix and\nwe will bring what\u2019s out there to you.\nHowever, I do recommend straying beyond one\u2019s bolthole so as to keep the\nmind clear and free from stagnation\nwith the sights and smells on offer in\nthe metropolis (mmm, inviting)!! For\nexample, close to home is the Hard\nRain photographic exhibit installed\nhere at Imperial.\nA little further afield, but still within a\nfeasible walking distance at the Saatchi\nGallery just off Sloane Square is Indian\nArt Today: The Empire Strikes Back.\nI have reviewed this interesting show\nif I still can\u2019t persuade you to emigrate\nfrom your warm nest!\nPerhaps my co-editor Lucy Harrold\ncan tempt you with Musical Theatre\nSoc\u2019s adaptation of Hair? There are\nplenty of plays on in theatre world -Caz Knight reviews for us Serenading\nLouie.\nAs for me, art is what does it for me\n\u2013 conventional, traditional, contemporary and downright subversive. As long\nas a group of people want to present to\nthe public the wealth of human creativity out there in material form, I want\nto see it!\nDo you feel the same? Why don\u2019t you\nwrite for us? Address to above email!\nThis is the dawning...\nLucy Harrold reviews Musical Theatre Soc\u2019s Hair adaptation\nNever too cold\nfor culture!\nRosieMilton\nRosieMilton Arts Editor\nAmerican Theatre: Getting Serious in London it Seems\nA\nmerican culture \u2013 who\ncan get enough of it? Serenading Louie, written\nby Lanford Wilson, revolves around two troubled marriages, and might as well have\nbeen set in any country, with characters of any nationality. Nonetheless,\nthere is something distinctly American about the play currently showing\nat the Donmar Warehouse. Despite\nthe presence of an American actor and\nthe fact that the TV is showing football\n(and not 'soccer'), this Americanness\nis (thankfully?) not forcefully dumped\nupon the audience. Rather, it is more\nsubtly ingrained into the play's struc-ture, and comes out in the attitudes\nof, and the conversations between, the\ncharacters.\nOn the face of it, there seems to be\nlittle of the famous American glitz and\nglamour in the play. Alex (played by\nthe American Jason Harner) and Carl\n(Jason O\u2019Mara) have been friends from\ntheir college days. Both dreamed in the\npast of making it big, and of changing\nthe world; both dreamed of satisfaction\nand happiness. Now, both are in the\nmiddle of faltering marriages, failing to\nfind any sort of happiness in their daily\nactivities and struggling, with the rest\nof humanity, to understand the greater\nmeaning of life. Together, they reminisce about the golden old days while\nat the same time, they mourn about\nhow they now feel trapped in a dreary\ncontinuum of chores and unfulfilling\ntasks. Carl probably summarises it best\nwhen he tells his wife Mary (played by\nGeraldine Somerville, who plays Lily\nPotter in the Harry Potter series) how\nany small incident was an \u2018event\u2019 in his\nyouth, whereas nothing now seems to\nbe of any weight or consequence.\nThe entire play is based around a single set: that of a living room which acts\nas a home for both families, neither of\nwhich can be described as being stable.\nAlex\u2019s wife Gabby (Charlotte Emerson),\nis an insecure woman whose meek attempts to be a good wife incessantly\nannoy her husband to no end. On the\nother hand, Alex is quickly frustrated\nby Gabby and finds her undesirable\nboth as a conversationalist and in the\nbedroom. He is more interested in\npursuing a political career, which is\nprobably an attempt to reconnect with\nhis younger days, when he believed\nthat he could make a difference. Emerson\u2019s acting, however, can sometimes\nbe a little unconvincing, and, while it\nis true that it is difficult to describe her\ncharacter simply, she seems artificial\nat times. This is reflected in the onstage relationship between Harner and\nEmerson, which is somewhat unnatural and overdone. On the other hand,\nthe relationship between O\u2019Mara and\nSomerville works better, even though\nthey are in a stranger situation in terms\nof the plot. Mary is cheating on Carl,\nand though he knows of her affair, he\nchooses to do nothing about it, in line\nwith his apathetic outlook. Interestingly, he justifies his lack of action with\nthe belief that his wife \u2018loves\u2019 the person with whom she has an affair with,\nas if this somehow means that there is\nno need for him to become involved.\nThe actors also work well together\nas a quartet when the couples inter-act, and they manage admirably to\nconnect through a joint conversation,\ndespite the spatial and emotional isolation of the characters on the stage.\nIt is this separation that seems to be\na fundamental focus of the play. It is\nextremely difficult to fully engage with\nthe characters or with the drama (or\nthe lack of it), and this is true despite\nthe slightly strange ending in which a\nsudden melodramatic twist jars awkwardly with the rest of the script. It\nT\nhis is the way it is. Jeanie\u2019s\nhung up on Claude, Sheila\u2019s hung up on Berger,\nBerger is hung up eve-rywhere. Claude is hung\nup on a cross over Sheila and Berger.\nAnd furthermore, Woof is hung up on\nBerger.\nAnd this is Hair, the American tribal\nlove-rock musical coming to the Union Concert Hall courtesy of Musical\nTheatre Society from 9th-13th March.\nContaining hits such as I Got Life,\nmade famous by Nina Simone and\nAquarius, erm... made famous by erm...\nThe Forty Year Old Virgin... prepare to\nbe taken back to New York in 1967. As\nthe Vietnam War rages in Vietnam, the\nfeisty tribe of hippies battle for peace,\nbeads, flowers and freedom and take\nyou on a roller coaster of emotions as\nthe tribe comes to terms with the realities of war and life in the 60s.\nThe Vietnam War ran from 1959 to\n1975, between America (supporting\nSouth Vietnam) and North Vietnam \u2013\nthe Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\nThis war was one of the first that everyday Americans actually believed was\navoidable; this image was not helped\nby extensive television coverage on\nthe subject. To get enough troops to\nsustain the war the government had to\nintroduce conscription, whereby every\nyoung man could be forced to join the\nArmy, Navy or Air Force unless they\ncould provide a good reason why not.\nMost of those trying to escape the\n\u201cdraft\u201d went to Canada or claimed they\nwere homosexuals.\nMany draft-dodgers were hippies \u2013 a\ncounter culture that evolved out of the\nBeatniks \u2013 think Allen Ginsberg the\npoet and Hunter S Thompson the writer portrayed by Johnny Depp in Fear\nand Loathing in Las Vegas. The Hippies believed in free love, non-violence\nand generally hanging around taking\ndrugs. Hair was conceived by two such\nhippies \u2013 James Rado and Gerry Ragni.\nRado and Ragni took the themes of the\ntimes and combined them with kick-ass music by Galt Macdermot, taking\ninspiration from everyone from Shakespeare to Abraham Lincoln. But Hair\nreaches further than just a bunch of\nhippies bumming around New York \u2013\nit carries the themes of freedom, peace\nand happiness that we all long for to-day. It sends out a strong message to\na world that is once again concerned\nwith terror and war to \u201cLet The Sunshine In\u201d.\nCaz KnightreviewingSerenadingLouieattheDonmarWarehouse,aplaywhichfocusesonthenuancesofdomesticlife\nis perhaps understandable, as a con-sequence, that an audience might feel\nfrustrated with, or on occasion even\ndisinterested, during the play. While\non one level, this is obviously not particularly encouraging from an entertainment perspective, on another, the\naudience\u2019s detachment from the stage\nsomehow complements, and helps one\nrelate to, the characters\u2019 detachment\nfrom life. In this respect, it is unlikely\nthat Serenading Louie will prove to be\na smashing success, but it is, neverthe-less, oddly satisfying in its own way.\nProbably not Louie being serenaded \u2013 a nuance of domestic life, from a frustrating, disinteresting, satisfying play.\nMusical Theatre Society\u2019s production of Hair is on in the Union\nConcert Hall 7.30pm (doors open\nat 7.15pm) 9th-13th March. Tickets\nare \u00a35 for students and \u00a37.50 for\nnon students and available from:\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/\nmusical-theatre-184/category.\nhtml.\n\n"

Think it\u2019s\nbecause I am currently living in a lab trying to polish\na bit of metal. No seriously I must\nspend at least 10 hours a week polishing and grinding. And no, that is not\nsome kinky teenage porn reference.\nAs to why it\u2019s teenage I\u2019ll let you pon-der. Moving from that rather disturbing image that I\u2019m sure the EEE faulty\nare enjoying slightly too much to the\nevents of Wednesday on the Hockey\nfield.\nFor any of you who actually care a\nbit about this university, and choose\nhaving a laugh over sitting holed up\nin your room like a hermit crab whose\nbeen deformed beyond recognition,\nwill know that the Bottle Match is\ncoming up. There will be a further explanation about this match next week,\nbut in a nutshell, it\u2019s been bigger and\nbetter than varsity. The winner of the\nrugby match gets the Bottle which\nis currently sitting in the Union Bar.\nAs I\u2019m a Hockey player, we\u2019ve been\nin training, and on Wednesday I got\ncarded for \u2018being overly dangerous to\nmyself.\u2019 Yes, I don\u2019t know either. After\nchecking for signs of heroin addiction I\nconcluded that the umpire was simply\na dozy twat. He was.\nApparently the bars have been re-named. Great. Because traditionally\nI don\u2019t choose a place to drink using\nthe, possibly blue-sky approach of\nprice, comfort and atmosphere. Oh\nno. Whenever I walk past a Rose and\nCrown I can\u2019t help but wander in for\na quick pint. However see a Trap and\nPony and I scarper like a rat up a drain-pipe. What goes through these peoples\nminds? It\u2019s just a fucking name. People\nwill complain, as I am doing now, but\nat the end of the day who really gives a\nshit? If people choose not to come to a\nbar because of a name then sod them.\nYou probably don\u2019t want twats like that\nkicking about the place anyway.\nFinally this place is bad enough as it\nis, what with Physics students walking round with E=MC2\non the back of\ntheir hoodies. You look like a wannabe\nhoodlum gang member. No, I lie. You\nlook like a 18 year old spotty white kid\nwhose trying to be cool. Or in other\nwords, a stretched arsehole. So lets not\ngo for geeky puns on \u2018Imperial\u2019 for the\nname eh? Pah, Whatever.\nWayne Kerr 10 Points\nNew\nFuller\nIndividual\nList\nWOW!!!\n\n"

Just the other day, we saw an old lady dispose of a whole\norange into a nearby pond. In a fit of rage, we grabbed her suitcase-trolley thing and bludgeoned her to death. As we stood over her\nmutilated corpse, with blood soaking through our newly bought\nNike Airs, we let out a sigh of satisfaction knowing that justice had been rightly\nserved. A passing duck quacked as if to say, \u201cJesus Christ! Is that an orange? I can\u2019t\neat an orange, I\u2019m a fucking duck! I don\u2019t have the piercing beak shape that other\nbirds possess to gnaw through the thick outer peel.\u201d\nSeeing such depraved oranges left us distraught. Why!? Why would someone\nthrow a whole orange into a pond? A WHOLE ORANGE! We wondered how\nmuch oranges meant to others. This week we interviewed fellow editors about\noranges and how they have influenced their lives. Everything they say is genuine.\nWHEN DID YOU FIRST DISCOVER ORANGES? I was five years old. My parents believed in the \u2018fruit-a-year\u2019 policy the government brought in, which entailed introducing a new fruit to a child each year to avoid stressing them out over\nthe vast amount of choice.\nANY EMBARRASSING ORANGE-BASED ANECDOTES? I was making sweet\nlove to my girlfriend one evening, when she told me that I just wasn\u2019t exciting\nenough. In a desperate attempt to liven things up I went down to my kitchen to\nsee if there was anything I could use to improvise. There on the counter sat a fist-sized Seville orange. Dark thoughts entered my mind\u2026 Should I? Could I? I did! I\nsliced the orange into boat segments and ate them in front of \u2018Lord of the Rings:\nThe Two Towers\u2019. I haven\u2019t seen my girlfriend since.\nHOW HAVE ORANGES INFLUENCED TODAY\u2019S MUSIC? It\u2019s a shame really.\nMusic seems to be all about love and poker faces these days. I miss the days of the\norange. The Beatles, Led Zepplin, Blondie, Blazin Squad \u2013 all about the oranges.\nNAME: LUKE TURNER\nSECTION: MUSIC EDITOR\nNAME: BRIGETTE ATKINS\nSECTION: SCIENCE EDITOR\nWHAT IS YOUR FIRST ORANGE-RELATED MEMORY? I was two years old\nand my Dad took me and my twin sister, Madeline, to the Marmalade festival\nin California. My Dad was dressed as a giant orange and took us up a large hill\nto overlook the local town, Sutter Creek. He was showing us the festive Orange\nDance when he lost his balance and rolled down the hill. I was caught by a passing Native American called Pocumtuck, but my sister was crushed to death.\nWHAT IS THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE ORANGE? The orange was invented\nby an Irish physician called Thomas O\u2019Range in 1535 for the treatment of scurvy.\nHe used highly radioactive isotopes to achieve the oranginess desired for high\nvitamin C content. Oranges are now the number one cause of cancer in the UK.\nFAVOURITE ORANGE-BASED QUOTE? \u2018At this moment in time, one cannot\nbe sure whether the cat inside the box is alive or dead.

Their activities include work placements around\nthe world, skills and leadership work-shops, and conferences. As well as\nengaging with fellow members from\na diverse range of academic and international backgrounds, AIESEC\u2019s\nmembers \u2013 numbering over a million\nworldwide \u2013 are given the support they\nneed to help communities in less developed regions.\nAIESEC now want to advertise their\nunique opportunities for gaining real\nbusiness and management experience\nin a global environment. This week felix\nBusiness is featuring testimonials from\nsome of the people who have benefited\nfrom their opportunities:\nMerwin Man, a second Year student\nmajoring in Civil Engineering, went\non a work abroad programme with\nAIESEC to Ghana last summer and did\nmarketing for a project called \u2018AfriTour\u2019\n,\nwhich aims to promote the benefits of\ntourism to students and inspire them\nto become future entrepreneurs in that\nfield.\n\u201cThis was really beneficial and helped\nme step outside my comfort zone.\nFor once in my life, I was actually doing something rather than studying!\u2019\u2019\nsaid Merwin.\nWhile marketing provided a refresh-Publicity officer Marcus Wu talks to some of the Society\u2019s first members about their projects around the world\nParticipants in an AIESEC project in Ghana - clearly some of the group were happier before the photographer arrived\nof events such as book donation drives,\ncharity sales and sporting events. With\nadequate funds and books gathered,\nBetty and her team visited the school\nlast Christmas and set up the school\u2019s\nnew library. She taught students how to\nmanage and use the library, read stories\nand educated them on the importance\nof environmental conservation. The\nsuccess of \u201cLove Literally\u201d also captured\nthe attention of the media and Betty\nwas even interviewed by BBC China on\nher involvement.\nBetty said of the experience, \u201cit was\nwonderful spending time with the children and what will always stay in my\nmind is the time when I read an English pop-up book to them. They gathered around me and remarked \u201cWow\u201d\nas every page turned! Nothing could\nbe more satisfying! The children have\ngained a lot from our visit, but I felt that\nwe have gained so much more. From\nfund-raising to the actual establishment\nof the new library, there were things to\nbe learnt at each stage, such as how to\nmotivate a team, how to make your promotion stand out from others, how to\nreach out to the crowds outside college\nand how to deal with unexpected events\nespecially when children are involved.\u201d\nAIESEC organises event throughout\nthe year in both the UK and abroad.\nConferences have been in places such\nas Oxford, Belfast and within London,\nand members from universities across\nthe United Kingdom can gather and\nvoice their opinions about global issues,\nleadership, business plans and marketing strategies.\nTerry Tsang, a 3rd and final year\nstudent in Bioengineering, attended\nAIESEC LDS (Leadership Development\nconference so much.\u2019\u2019 said Terry.\nAIESEC members in Imperial College\nLondon have enjoyed a positive learning experience thus far and every member has grown in one way or another.\nAIESEC Imperial is a young student\ngroup, and all this would not have been\npossible without the people behind its\ninception in 2009. Weili Dong, current\nLocal Committee President of AIESEC\nImperial, is the main driving force behind every member of the team and\nshe has dedicated a lot of her time and\nenergy in setting up and managing the\nnew chapter of the world\u2019s largest student organisation. Despite the many\ndifficulties faced while the group was\nat its infancy, Weili never regretted in\ncommitting herself to AIESEC when\nshe saw the enthusiasm of her members and how they valued their AIESEC\nexperiences.\n\u2018\u2019For me, starting up AIESEC Imperial\nwith a passionate team has been and\nwill be the highlight of my life in Imperial. It is certainly not easy to start a\nsociety from scratch. Over the last year,\nwe shared the sorrows and pain together when faced with uphill challenges.\nHowever, it is amazing to see how our\nteam managed to keep the morale up\nand encourage one another along our\njourney.\n\u201cFor us, AIESEC means more than a\nsociety. It is a family, where we find support and opportunities to achieve what\nwe believe in. I especially treasure the\nopportunities AIESEC has given me to\ndevelop our members and empower\ntheir future. Their positive feedbacks\nfor the various events we organised\nwill continue drive me to work hard for\nwhat I believe in.\u2019\u2019\ning experience for Merwin outside\nthe engineering sector, adapting to a\nwhole new lifestyle in Ghana provided\na greater challenge to him due to the\ndiversities in culture and environment.\nFortunately, AIESECers in Ghana were\npresent to attend to his administrative and daily needs and helped him\nintegrate into their local environment.\nDuring the work abroad programme,\nMerwin has not only acquired a new set\nof skills, but also embraced the warmth\nand hospitality of AIESECers from a\ndifferent country and made many long-lasting friendships.\n\u201cThe change in lifestyle opened\nmy eyes and I have met many people\nfrom different backgrounds and stat-ures. I could have only done this with\nAIESEC. The extensive social network\nthat AIESEC provided has allowed me\nto feel fully supported in a strange new\nenvironment. As AIESECers, we looked\nafter each other like family while we\nwere in Ghana, especially with other\nexchange participants. I fully enjoyed\nmy time doing my job and achieved\nsome major things that I thought I\nwould never be able to do.\u201d added\nMerwin.\nAnother participant, Betty Tai \u2013 a\nsecond year student reading Chemistry \u2013 went on a journey of discovery in\nHeyuan, China. In collaboration with\nImperial PASS (Public Awareness and\nSocial Services) Society, Betty initiated\n\u201cLove Literally\u201d \u2013 a fund-raising project\nfor the local XinGang Primary School.\nBetty and her team organized a series\nConference) 2010, which was held in\nNottingham from 5th \u2013 8th February\nthis year. The national conference was\ntargeted at AIESECers throughout the\nUnited Kingdom and focused on leadership development and team dynam-ics. Together with 5 other AIESECers\nfrom the college, Terry attended this\nannual event and returned beaming\nwith enthusiasm about what he had\nlearnt.\n\u2018\u2019Throughout the 4 day conference,\nwe were provided with plenty of opportunities to explore leadership and\ndevelop a range of skills from different\naspects. We had leadership and skills\ntraining sessions conducted by leading\ncompanies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers and GlaxoSmithKline. In the\nother sessions, we were teamed up randomly and given a short period of time\nto achieve a specified set of goals. This\nprovided us the opportunity to discover\nand understand our roles in a team,\nand train our abilities to cooperate and\ncommunicate with different people.\nIt was very exciting and I enjoyed this\n\u201cAIESEC\u2019s members\n\u2013 numbering\nover a million\nworldwide \u2013 are\ngiven the support\nthey need to help\ncommunities in less\ndeveloped regions\u201d\nAIESEC has a presence in all counries marked in blue - that\u2019s quite a few...\n\u201cThe success...\ncaptured the\nattention of\nthe media and\nBetty was even\ninterviewed by\nBBC China on her\ninvolvement\u201d\n\u201cstarting up AIESEC\nImperial with a\npassionate team has\nbeen and will be the\nhighlight of my life\nin Imperial\u201d\n\n"

I\u2019m going to say two words and you have\nto promise to keep reading, deal? O.k. \u201cFolk\nOpera\u201d. Are you still there? Good, because although R. Kelly may have forever tainted the\nmusic as theatre crossover with \u201cTrapped in\nthe Closet\u201d, this genuine theatre production is an absolute\ngem. It\u2019s the story of Orpheus and Eurydice which, for those\nwithout degrees in Greek mythology, involves the lyre playing Orpheus descending into hell to save his love Eurydice\nwith his musical abilities. This version is set in depression-era America. Hadestown is a hard-down company town\nand Hades is the company boss; oh and of course Orpheus\nwields not a lyre, but a banjo. Anais has pulled together an\nimpressive roster of artists on this album. We\u2019ve got Ani\ndiFranco, Greg Brown and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver on a\ntwisting musical tale that grows from toe-tapping theatre to\ndeep dulcet monologues and soothing ballads. This album\nis definitely a music lover\u2019s record, there\u2019s such richness to it\nand if you want you can come to the felix office and listen to\nit with me. - Kadhim Shubber\nT\nhe story of how John Bull and the Bandits\nformed is rather long-winded (and I suspect,\nalthough I\u2019m not certain, mostly untrue) and\nso I won\u2019t fill this column with that particular tale. Besides it\u2019s their knee-slapping, hoedown inciting, wild blue-grass and folk music that really\nmakes this band worth listening to.\nFronted by two Sussex brothers, Sam and Tom Bull (pic-tured), the band draw deeply from old-time motown artists but their hearts probably live somewhere closer to Bob\nDylan. The two (together forming the imagined persona of\nJohn Bull) had been busking around London since leaving\nschool and apart from dropping out of University, writing\nsongs and mastering their instruments, they\u2019d made little headway. However now with a fully formed band (i.e.\nthe Bandits) they\u2019ve been hitting a number of high-profile\nvenues like Ronnie Scotts, Ain\u2019t Nothing But Blues Bar and\nthe Troubadour with their finger-clicking whirlwind sets\nand next Thursday they bring that energy to the legendary\nProud Galleries in Camden. - Kadhim Shubber\nFolk up your life!\nB\neing turned away upon arrival at the venue certainly\ndid make our eventual entry\nall the more satisfying, but it\nwas also pleasing to see that\nthis place was a comfortingly cosy size\nfor a relaxed evening of live music.\nThe opening act, Foreign Slippers,\nmentioned that their band this evening\nconsisted of replacements for their ill\nmembers, but this did not prevent them\nfrom putting on a modest yet charming\nshow.\nThe Swedish singer of Foreign Slippers, Gabrielle Fr\u00f6d\u00e9n, showed a singing voice that was unexpected from\nthe gaudy appearance of her attire. Her\ncurtain-print red dress and matching holly-leaves headpiece suggested\nnothing of her fragile and commanding voice. Although it was evident that\nher band were standing in for absent\nmembers, this did not hinder her effortless singing style, which reminded\nme of the voices of Kate Earl, Feist and\neven Billie Holiday. This was a modest\nband, with no roadies, and it wasn\u2019t\nuntil after the gig that I learned their\nname since they made no mention of\nit during their set. They did, however,\nthank Animal Kingdom for the opportunity to play this evening, and ended\nthe set as swiftly as they had started it.\nAnimal Kingdom was enthusiastically welcomed to the stage by a\nnumber of apparently loyal and very\nvocal fans. After quick introductions,\nthey launched into past singles which\nprompted some sing-along from these\ndie-hards. It was evident that the audience found the music easy to follow\nas it didn\u2019t take long for some fully-fledged dancing to begin, and some\nrhythmic spilling of the beverages. The\nband\u2019s relationship with the audience\nwas comfortably amiable and the lead\nvocalist Richard Sauberlich certainly\ntook advantage of the audience\u2019s eagerness to engage in banter.\nAs they played, the idea became\nmore plausible that perhaps Sauberlich\nhad become the vocalist of the band\nsimply because he possessed the traits\nthat are associated with so-called band\nleaders, and lacked the instrumental\nskills otherwise. His vocal talents left\nsomething to desire, unless the aim\nwas to sound strained and weak whilst\nIt\u2019s vocals versus instruments for Animal Kingdom\nmaintaining a falsetto throughout the\nset, although he was obviously an extrovert who eased his band members\u2019\nnerves by mediating conversation between the audience and the band.\nThe audience was however very\nresponsive towards the commanding drumming which led the music\nthroughout. Geoff Lea, the drummer,\nwas the key to the dynamics of the live\nsound, but that is not to say that the\nother members simply followed his\nlead. Each instrument had its own moment during the set, and I even go as\nfar as to say that the instrumental parts\nof the set were better by my ears than\nthe wailing vocals-led part were; so it\u2019s\na shame that Animal Kingdom don\u2019t\nallow enough room for the instruments to just play. Instead, each good\npassage of music would arrive at the\nanti-climax of even more eerie vocals.\nWhen the moment arrived for the\nballad, I knew it was time to leave. Especially since the opening line of the\nsinging sounded very similar to an early\nnoughties pop song by a certain Amy\nStudt. But I\u2019m sure nobody else noticed.\n-Joanna Cai\nAnimal Kingdom\nBorderline\n23rd February\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nJohn Bull\n& the\nBandits\n@ Proud:\nThursday\n4th\nMarch\nAnais\nMitchell\u2019s\nHadestown\nreleased\nApril 26th\nto track - so we can deduce that\nImperial students have a poor taste\nin albums and a refined taste in\nsingles. Alright I\u2019ve strung out this\ncolumn to breaking point. Just stop\nlistening to Radiohead! Just for one\nweek, please?\n-Kadhim Shubber\n\n"

The album is\nchock full of MTV-friendly pop-rock\ntracks \u2013 think of Blink 182 in eyeliner,\nsinging early-90\u2019s power ballads \u2013 and\nwhile it\u2019s not quite Nickelback terri-tory, anybody looking for profound\ninsights into the nature of the human\npsyche should probably be looking\nelsewhere. The album improves in\nthe second half \u2013 the first decent riff\nmakes an entrance on track 8, \u201cIn the\nArms of Rain\u201d, but all in all, though, I\nprobably wouldn\u2019t bother.\n- Duncan Casey\nTRAIL\nTO THE REST OF\nTHE WORLD\nTWISTID\nALBUM\nI know I shouldn\u2019t, but I really like this\nalbum. It\u2019s not mould-breaking, it\u2019s not\ngoing to change the world, but it is a\nreally nice collection of laid-back rock\nsongs in the Goo Goo Dolls or Counting Crows vein - the kind of stuff you\nwant playing loudly on the stereo as\nyou blast up the highway in your open\ntop Caddy. At the same time, there\u2019s a\nclear London influence on the music:\ntracks like \u2018City\u2019, the current single, and\n\u2018Fumes\u2019 leave you in little doubt as to\nwhere the band are from.\n- Duncan Casey\nSimian Mobile Disco @ Matter\nD\nuring the early hours of\nSunday morning, Simian Mobile Disco turn\nthe amps up to 11, the\nheating up to burn, and\nenergy to lethal at Matter. Cruising\nonto stage at a casual 2am, the lights\nexplode with power and Simian Mobile Disco erupt into their set with audacious energy. Striking up \u2018Audacity\nof Huge\u2019 intensified the atmosphere\nat Matter. It was a huge sound and a\nhuge vibe as it started to spiral unin-hitedly out of control... Oh wait, that\nmight have been me. As Simian Mobile\nDisco soldiered on with the stamina of\nelectro warriors, their set was a rollercoaster of thundering bass and slicing treble. They leapt around the stage\nas their crown leapt around the floor\nand it was as if their minds were at one\nwith the many wires, buttons and dials\nof their technologies. The music that\nfollowed Simian Mobile Disco was really nothing to compare and it\u2019s safe to\nsay their huge electronic sound was left\nwith us for hours. - Luke Turner\nSimian Mobile Disco\nMatter\n20th February\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nVampire Weekend @ Brixton\nI\nf I had the means to bring you\nthe sounds and faces of Vampire\nWeekend in a live set, I really\nwouldn\u2019t. Not because they play\nhorrifically and look ghastly,\nbut in fact the total opposite; I\u2019d keep\ntheir tight, well-experienced manner\nof playing coupled with one and a half\nhours of \u201cWell hello Mr. Koenig. Hello\nMr. Thompson. Aren\u2019t you looking\nfine tonight? Nomnomnom,\u201d to my-self. No, not for you mere mortals.\nOne and a half hours? Indeed. Unlike most bands that choose the\n\u201chighlights\u201d from their releases and\nfrustrate you until the end of mere 40\nminutes because they just won\u2019t play\nthat one song that changed your life\n(or you know, something along those\nlines); VW said fuck it, let\u2019s play every\nsingle one of our amazing songs and\ntwo of our magnificent B-sides.

Given\nthe fact that just under half of the starting XI were abroad, captain Mustapher\nBotchway had informally agreed with\nthe RUMS (UCL Medicals) captain to\nreschedule the ULU Challenge Cup\nSemi-Final to the week after (27 February). However, in attempt to capitalise\non this, the captain had reneged on\nthis agreement and stipulated that the\ngame was to take place on its original\ndate, to avoid conceding a walkover.\nA 2-hour public transport journey to\nShenley (Hertfordshire) later, Imperial\nwere eager to wipe the smile off their\nLondon neighbour\u2019s faces in Imperial\u2019s\nbiggest game of the season. The semifinal began in a tense fashion with Imperial testing the RUMS defence with\nprobing long balls. RUMS\u2019 tactic of\nusing the wings were nullified by the\ncombative Imperial midfield. RUMS\nthen tried to resort to using the individual talent of their central midfielder\nto create opening for their strikers.\nPlaying a 4-4-1-1 formation, Imperial\u2019s 2nd XI captain and stand in front\nman, Damian Phelan lacked the partner he needed to capitalise on his ability to hold the ball up. Romain Chauvet\nwent up-front as the ubiquitous 4-4-2\nwas restored for the remainder of the\nhalf and more chances were created\nfrom the menacing work of left midfielder David Hayes and central midfielder Caspar Paxton who brought an\nexcellent save from the RUMS UCL 1st\nXI keeper on the 35 minute mark.\nFive minutes before half time, with\nImperial controlling much of the pos-session, the RUMS striker intercepted\na pass in Imperial\u2019s third and was\nthrough on goal. The efforts of defenders Patrick McMullen and David\nSapin, with the goalkeeper Botchway\ndoing just enough to put him off bal-ance, the striker played a weak shot\ntowards goal, that centre back Tom\nFryatt cleared with ease.\nImperial played with possession for\nthe remainder of the half. The team felt\nthat though they had possession they\nwere not playing as well as they could,\ngiven the occasion. Incompletion of\npasses and the lack of pressing in the\nmidfield were areas which needed to\nbe addressed if Imperial were to take\nsignificant control of the game.\nThe second half started at a high\ntempo, with the strategy of pressing\nRUMS as soon as they approached Imperial\u2019s half being adopted. This produced frequent changes of possession\nthat brought an element of unpredictability to the game.\nFifteen minutes into the second half\na RUMS corner was dealt with inefficiently with Botchway getting fingertips to the cross, which slightly deflected its path towards the striker who was\nunable to beat McMullen who cleared\nit swiftly.\nTheocharis Tofis worked well with\nHayes on the left hand side that created more unconverted half-chances for\nPhelan and Will Swain up front. Central midfielder Jonathan Hill, whose\nrole this season has been to afford no\nspace to the opposition midfield, did so\ndiligently, with well timed tackles and\nexcellent vision to kick-start Imperial\u2019s\nbreaks.\nWith Fifteen minutes to go, some\nbright interchange between right\nmidfielder Mark Smith and Phelan\ndrew the RUMS defence out of posi-tion. The ball was played to Hill, who\nscored what any footballing fan would\ndescribe as a screamer. Picking the ball\nup, he took one touch and shot from\n25 yards out, beating the UCL 1st XI\ngoalkeeper to the top right corner of\nLast weekend, three London teams\nentered the 18th edition of Sheffield\nUSIST, the biggest international student judo tournament held in the UK.\nThis team event involves 4 guys and\n2 girls fighting in weight order.\nThis year, 4 students from Imperial\nmade it into the London A team:\nBronwyn Dawson (-57kg), Edouard\nDesclaux (-73kg), Rahul Bose (-81kg)\nand Ben Browne (-90kg). Sarah Taylor\nfrom UCL (+57kg) and Constantine\nLerounis from King\u2019s College (+90kg)\ncompleted the line-up.\nThe two other London teams, London B and C were also mostly drawn\nfrom Imperial freshers who had just\nstarted judo last term. Given their lack\nof experience and the fact that they\nwere up against players who had competed for most of their lives, our rookies did extremely well.\nLondon B faced very tough opposition in their pools with the hosts, Sheffield A and the A team from Southampton. While Sheffield proved to be\ntoo experienced, Kwasi and Ualikhan\nmanaged to win their fights against\nSouthampton.\nLondon C also faced tough opposition in their first pool fight against\nNewcastle A. Despite losing all their\nmatches they showed great spirit and\nfought back well against Nottingham\nB.\nCaptained by Joe Skerman-Gray,\nPasha Normahani nicely caught out\nhis opponent with a hip throw. Lucien\nCopus managed to take his opponent\ndown into ne-waza (groundwork) and\nwon his fight with a hold down.\n\n"

Each\nstand will be different so you\u2019re always\nkept on your toes.\nIn total the Imperial team hit 504\nclays out of 800. The undergraduate\nteam contributed to 255 of these whilst\nthe graduates picked up the other 249.\nHence this year the young, poor students claimed just enough points to\nhave their names on the Q-A trophy\nonce again.\nWith outstanding performances\nfrom Ed Poore (94) and Ayman Sleiman (83), they ensured that Imperial\ntook three of the five first place titles\nwith Ed coming first overall (out of\n340 shooters) and first undergradu-ate, while Ayman took first place out of\nall the graduates.

Judges Alex Ross, Medic lecturer Dr. Chris John, Felix Editor Dan\nWan, and Deputy President (Clubs\n& Societies) Jenny Wilson were on\nhand to oversee and comment on the\nnight\u2019s proceedings.\nThe first impressive performance\ncame from Vic, a 2nd year FrenchSwedish biologist who performed a\nstunning rendition of Whitney Houtheir welcome on stage with Dan Wan\ncommenting that \u201cthe bit where you\nall went mental at the end was just a\nbit unnecessary.\u201d However, all four\njudges also admitted they were a solid\nband and commented their performance probably hadn\u2019t done their recorded tracks justice.\nYourssuf Saleh entertainted the\ncrowd with version of Justin Timberlake\u2019s XXXXX, even getting the\ncrowd singing along. Whilst Jenny\nWilson was suitably impressed, the\nother three judges decided the performance was over-rehearsed, with\nDr. Chris John commenting his performance was \u201ctried and tested.\u201d\nThe night finished with two very\nstrong performances with Sangita\nsinging alongside a full complement\nof instruments to Valerie by Amy\nWinehouse/The Zutons. Her strong\nvoice and pitch-perfect execution was\nmatched by the last performer, KUDZI.\nThe solo artist sang and danced to the\nT\nhe answer to the question\non everyone\u2019s lips has finally been announced. After weeks of violent spec-ulation, Imperial Student\nUnion has revealed that the new club\nnext year to replace dBs will be called\nMetric. Obviously as the name sug-gests, it is hoped that Metric will be an\nimprovement on dBs. The name of the\nnew bar (after getting rid of da Vinci\u2019s)\nhowever, is still to be decided!\nMetric was the winner of an online\npoll for students, winning by a massive\nmargin over the other options, with\nvoter numbers reaching much higher\nthan expected because of the controversy over the shortlist. Ashley Brown\nhad said the naming process \u201cwill be\nthe most controversial part of the presidency then. Or, a triumph of student\ninvolvement.\u201d\nWhilst Metric won by popular consensus for the nightclub, the same cannot be said for the new bar, the winning name for which was the Consort,\ncoming only narrowly ahead of the\nother options and attracting lots of\nnegative comments about the options.\nThese were drawn up from students\u2019\nsuggestions, first by filtering the dross\nto leave 150 plausible names which\nwere then considered by a team of five,\nconsisting of Ashley Brown, Dan Wan,\na student and two members of staff.\nAn initial outcry against some of the\nsuggested options spurred interest in\nthe poll and while the naming of the\nnew club seems to have been a suc-cess, there have also been a significant\nnumber of negative complaints on the\nwebsite. In fact, it\u2019s difficult to find\npeople who are happy with the shortlist for the bar at all. Most complain\nthat they don\u2019t like any of the names so\nthey\u2019ve had to choose the least worst\noption. A facebook group for instance,\nhas been set-up promoting Rock Bottom as a moniker instead.\nIt\u2019s difficult to see how the Union\ncould have carried out a more democratic process, which was entirely\nstudent-led and in which students who\nwanted to influence the decision have\nhad excellent opportunities to do so\nthrough proposing names and promoting their favourites.\nOf course it would be impossible\nto please everyone, but it must be accepted that this democratic method\nwas the best way to please the greatest\nnumber of people. The only barrier to\na well-chosen name is student apathy,\nand for naming the bar, it\u2019s all still to\nplay for.\nAfter listening to the complaints of\nstudents, the Union is holding off the\nfinal decision. In order to choose a\nname for the new bar which is more\npopular, it is probable that nominations will be re-opened, the least popular dropped and a second round will be\nused to determine the outcome. This\nwill please those who voted on an unofficial Live! poll where RON took the\nmajority of the votes, presumably from\npeople with suggestions of a higher\nstandard.\nIt seems likely that after facing the\nprospect of a truly disastrous name\nchange, and realising what they have\nto lose, the campaign for the naming\nof the new bar will be hotly fought.\nImperial converted to Metric\nThe results of the polls to rename the Union bars are in, but the Union have taken the decision to hold off on\na final name for the new Da Vinci\u2019s.

She\nperformed with\nan impressive\n5-man band\nston\u2019s \u201cSaving All My Love For You\u201d.\nJudge Alex Ross was not entirely convinced by her on-stage antics however\nafter Vic suggestively took off her\njacket mid-song.\nKitty Magic and Wolfy and the Tin\nCan 44s battled it out for the label\nof best band, with the latter providing a massively popular and comical\nperformance of their song \u201cI\u2019ve Lost\nMy Mojo\u201d. The judges decided unanimously that Kitty Magic outplayed Kings of Leon\u2019s Sex on Fire. This wasn\u2019t\nbefore silencing the crowd with a jaw-droppingly dramatic start to the song.\nHowever, after the audience cast\ntheir votes, hosts for the night Jaimie\nHenry and Fran Conway announced\nrunner-up Wolfy and the Tin Can\n44s, and overall winner Sangita. She\nwas cheered along by a large con-tigent of her hall-mates. An elated\nSangita commented: \u201cTo be honest,\nI was completely incredulous when I\nwon Imperial Idol. All I can remember was feeling really nervous before\ngoing on; but the audience\u2019s reaction\nwas so warm once I\u2019d started singing,\nI just became calm and relaxed. Even\nthough I was happy with how I\u2019d done,\nI didn\u2019t think in a million years I\u2019d actually win it!\nCredit has to go to my band, who really lifted the energy of the performance and made it what it was. Imperial Idol has definitely inspired me to\nperform more, and make the most of\nthe many opportunities at imperial-so I\u2019m afraid you haven\u2019t heard the last\nfrom me yet!\u201d\n\u201cThe only barrier to\na well-chosen name\nis student apathy.\u201d\nTop bar chart for new nightclub name: dBs looks to be renamed \u2018Metric\u2019.

    "content": "27\nfelix FRIDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2010\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk TRAVEL\nDL I have actually seen that scene in\nthe trailer for Tropic of Cancer.\nSR Have you?\nDL Yes. That\u2019s why I was giggling to\nmyself earlier. Awesome and awful\nin the same time.\nSR Luckily nobody was hurt. There\u2019s a lot\nyou can extract from a situation like that,\nif you\u2019re constantly thinking about what\neach situation means in a wider context,\n\u201cI feel much happier\nwhen spontaneous,\nfriendly encounters\nhappen \u2013 they\u2019re\nwhat travelling is all\nabout\u201d\nand whether or not I can use it to the\nmeans of telling the viewers a little more\nabout the country I\u2019m in. In this case, a\npileup in the middle of a city, nobody in\na uniform appeared at any point to take\ncharge of the situation. No police, no am-bulance. People would just have to pick\nthemselves up and move on. That\u2019s the\nchaos of India really; it may be a line in\nthe commentary, hopefully some viewers will identify it as the India they know.\nDL I\u2019ve been debating with myself on\nwhere lies the balance between trav-el-related social media and physical\ntravel. With travel documentaries\nand literature, there certainly must\nbe a similar balance: they encourage people to travel by making destinations seem more attractive and\nless alien, whilst at the same time\ndiscourage by taking away the surprise and, occasionally, have places\nappear dangerous that they seem\nbetter documented and viewed than\nvisited.\nSR It\u2019s interesting to have that question\nin your mind when you\u2019re providing in-formation. I suppose if you\u2019re a traveller\nand you\u2019re looking to go on a big adven-ture, they have to make their minds up\nfor themselves whether they wish to\nconsume the travel guidebooks to such-and-such a country. A lot of people certainly don\u2019t want to do that: they do want\nto have encounters and experiences that\nnever come out of a book. They don\u2019t\nhave to read the books and they don\u2019t\nhave to watch the programmes.\nIn terms of the more dangerous areas\nof the world, of which there are a huge\nnumber, violence fortunately tends to be\nfairly localised now at this point in our\nhistory. There are obviously areas in the\nworld where you would have to advise\npeople against going there but generally\nthe world is a very warm and welcoming\nplace \u2013 anything that reminds people of\nhow friendly and hospitable foreign folks\nare has to be a good thing. It\u2019s a form of\ndiplomacy really. When a British TV\ncrew are welcomed with open arms in\nany random country, to people watching back home it\u2019s nice for them to know\nthere is no hostility from those people,\nwho are pleased to see visitors.\nOne thing I suppose is the case that\ndoes worry me a little bit about travel\nliterature or TV travel documentaries \u2013\nincluding my own - is that it can inspire\nor encourage a sort of arms race when\nit comes down to travel. People see our\nstories and how we film and think they\nwouldwanttodoabitofthataswell.They\ncould try to emulate what we\u2019ve done\nand, considering the amount of organisation we put into these programmes, it\nisn\u2019t always something other people can\ndo. That issue with emulation is a problem particularly with wildlife documen-taries, a complaint I have about them, in\nthat often they show only the best bits of\na situation. Or a wildlife reserve\u2019s money\nshot, as it were, of the pride of lions lapping up the water at the isolated water-hole; they won\u2019t show the waterhole, the\ncontext around that, and they won\u2019t say\nthey filmed that in a packed wildlife reserve that\u2019s been overstocked with ani-mals. So when people go to Africa they\nexpect to see the same thing: they want\nto see the pride of lions around the wa-terhole. And so wildlife sanctuaries and\nconservation centres have to overstock\ntheir parks so they can provide tourists\nwith what they\u2019ve seen or read about.\nThere is a risk. I take onboard what\nyou\u2019ve said but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an\neasy answer to it. In terms of the programmes I make, we do try and show\nboth sides of a situation or we try to give\na bit more context and show positive and\nnegative aspects of different places.\nDL I guess your travels sprang from\nthe need to research first-hand on\nyour subjects of interest - it was like\na gateway to truly understand your\nfield of studies. Being a geology stu-dent, I saw my first ever live lava-spewing volcano in September; a\ntextbook and its diagrams can never\nprepare me for the grandeur standing before me.\nSR Magnificent eh?\nDL Absolutely. How would you convince a student to cast aside their\nrigid, repetitive textbook education\nand tell him to go into the world and\nexperience it first-hand in order to\nfurther his knowledge?\nSR Nothing would be as memorable\nas actually being there. You can read as\nmuch as you like, but being underneath\nor on top of a volcano, or in a rainfor-est, or climbing up a mountain in South\nAmerica, having all your senses tingled\nand teased by the situation you\u2019re in,\nyou\u2019ll never forget those adventures. Literature, frankly, however good it is, can\u2019t\n\u201cNothing would be\nas memorable as\nbeing there, having\nall your senses\ntingled and teased\u201d\nhope to compete with them because it\ncannot drown you in new experiences\nand senses. And on top of your opportunity to see those places, you also have\nthe excitement of getting there, the spontaneous encounters you\u2019ll have along the\nway, the experiences that\u2019ll challenge\nyour perception of what you knew about\na situation. If you travel with your eyes\nand mind open you\u2019ll learn a lot more.\nI\u2019m not suggesting casting aside the lit-erature, merely treating it as supplementary and as a teaching aid rather than the\nprincipal lesson. Getting out there is always the best thing.\nDL What do you think is your greatest strength as a traveller?\nSR I think I\u2019m very good at empathising\nwith people. The more I travel, the more I\nrealise just what somebody means when\nthey say, for example, the rain hasn\u2019t\ncome and they haven\u2019t got any food. It\nis possible to travel occasionally with a\nwestern mindset, which leads us to think\nthat they\u2019ll be OK, that the welfare state\nwill kick in and someone will look after\nthem. I suppose one of the tragedies of\nlife outside countries with a welfare state\nis that welfare state doesn\u2019t exist in most\nparts of the world! These people won\u2019t\nbe OK. They quite possibly will, at the\nvery best, be extremely hungry or, worst,\nthey\u2019ll starve. It\u2019s desperately sad to encounter stories like that and it breaks my\nheart every single time I hear it. I don\u2019t\njust go back and tuck into my rehydrated\nboil-in-the-bag meal without being conscious of the sufferings I\u2019ve seen on the\njourneys.\nDL And your worst flaw?\nSR Probably my extraordinary inability\nto master any language other than my\nown. It\u2019s partly laziness, partly inadequate\nopportunity, and partly the fact that I\u2019m\ntravelling to too many countries and\nthere are too many languages to learn. I\nhave tried, slightly desperately, to learn at\nleast a few words in each language. It is my\nmajor failing as it does affect my ability to\nengage directly with people, and it does\nmean I\u2019m reliant on guides and watching\nbody language. I\u2019d love to know some obscure languages and be able to talk to everybody - that would be the most fantastic\ninvention anyone can ever offer.\nDL Where is the next destination?\nSR [Hesitates] I really do not know. It\u2019s a\nbig world; I\u2019ve been to 90 countries which\nhas been an extraordinary opportunity.\nBut there are still big chunks of the world\nthat I haven\u2019t visited and I\u2019d love to go to.\nI\u2019d still love to go to West Africa, Central America, Russia, Japan, Canada, and\nspend more time in the Middle East \u2013 I\u2019m\nhopeful that one day I\u2019d be able to visit\nthose places. And the tropics as well: now\nthat I have finished the series and having\nspent a lot of time there, I\u2019m conscious\nof the fact that it\u2019s the completion of my\nthree journeys around the tropics. But,\nfor me, it is the most interesting, most\nspectacular, most beautiful and most\nblighted part of the planet \u2013 I\u2019d be devastated if I never have the opportunity\nto go back there and spend more time in\nthe most amazing part of the world. I\u2019m\nstill up for more gobsmacking sights and\nadventures and keen to go on for as long\nas I can. But it\u2019s up to the BBC: they\u2019re the\nones in charge.\nDL I\u2019d happily anticipate a Tropic:\nRevisited series from you.\nSR [Laughs] Only once we\u2019ve finished\nediting the final programme of the se-ries. And then I\u2019ll have a break and start\nworking out what to do next. On my desk\nthere\u2019s a giant mouse pad which is a map\nof the world and, it\u2019s big eh? Plenty still to\ngo, plenty still to see!\nAn Insider\u2019s Haunt: Singapore\nHolly Farrer\nHolly Farrer\nWhen most people think of Singapore\nthey think of some weird kind of police\nstate where everyone speaks crappy English, where you can\u2019t chew gum or spit on\nthe streets and where the cops will hang\nyouifyou\u2019recaughtwithdrugs.Actually,I\nguess that\u2019s kind of true \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t\nstop it from being one of the coolest cities\nI\u2019ve lived in. It\u2019s because Singapore is so\nsafe you can roam the streets at 3am discovering \u2018hidden gems\u2019 without getting\nstabbed; that\u2019s exactly what my friends\nand I did whilst we were growing up.\nOne of my favourite places to hang out\nat in Singapore would definitely have to\nbe the Tea Party on Bukit Timah Road.\nThis place is a small two-storey caf\u00e9/bar\nfull of sofas arranged around low tables.\nThe owners are always playing really\nchilled music and will throw on any musical suggestions you have providing they\naren\u2019t retarded. You can get some amazing teas here \u2013 my recommendation is\nthe \u2018Fruity Russian Caravan\u2019 \u2013 and the\nowners also have an extensive collection\nof board games that they\u2019ll let you use.\nIf tea & board games isn\u2019t really your\nthing then you might enjoy hanging\naround Arab Street. Arab Street itself isn\u2019t\nreally a hidden gem \u2013 every bloody tourist\nfinds their way there \u2013 but there are some\nbrilliant shisha bars/restaurants around\nthere that are relatively unfrequented.\nAmbrosia Caf\u00e9 is a cute little shisha bar\non Baghdad Street \u2013 just off Arab street\n\u2013 decked out with cushions around coffee tables and a general smell of incense;\nit offers all your standard shisha flavours\nas well as few more and will serve alcohol\n(a lot of the shisha places won\u2019t). Foodwise one of the best places to visit in Arab\nStreet would be Zam-Zam\u2019s: it\u2019s a small\nrestaurant/food-court hybrid that serves\nthe most greasy, tasty north Indian food\nyou could hope for.\nSomething I despise about London is\nthat everything closes so early. Bar the kebab stalls outside Pacha and Koko, there\nreally aren\u2019t that many places to get food\nwhen you\u2019re out and starving at 2am. In\nSingapore one of my favourite places to\neat at is a sort of upmarket food-court\ncalled Spize, just off River Valley Road; it\u2019s\nopen till about 4am and serves the most\npopular local food, mainly Chinese and\nIndian, and non-alcoholic drinks (recom-mendation: the Milo Dinosaur) at very\ncheap prices.\nTropic of Cancer will be broadcasted on BBC2, Sunday nights at 8pm,\nfrom March 7th\nto April 11th\n.

We\u2019ve\ngot all the arts we\nneed here... then\ngrab your crotch\u201d\nW\nhilst walking\nthrough Hyde Park\none day, I came\nacross a very peculiar sight.\nThere was a man engaged in a very\npassionate argument. He swore, he\ncursed, he turned a funny colour. But\nhis opponent would not be moved by\nhis entreaties. I can\u2019t be sure what the\ndisagreement was about but I knew\nwhat I was seeing. There was a man\nhaving an argument with a tree. And\nyou know what? I think the tree won.\nAt first, I was confused. How could\na man lose an argument to a tree? We\nhave legs, we have mouths; we are the\nenvy of the plant world! But does a tree\nneed legs? Does it need a mouth? It\nhas been said it\u2019s better to be silent and\nthought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt. I admit, I had no gauge\non the tree\u2019s IQ but the man wouldn\u2019t\nbe winning the Nobel Prize any time\nsoon. After all, he was arguing with a\nTree!\nAnd losing...\nThis got me thinking; we could learn\na lot from trees. For instance, when\nwe find the weights of the world bearing down on us, instead of fretting\nand fussing and other very mammalian things, we should just stand still,\nbreathe, and take a moment out to\nthink. Is this something I can remedy?\nYes? Then I\u2019ll remedy it. No? Then I\u2019ll\nthink of something else. Consider, how\nmany trees do you see drowning their\nsorrows in the Union? Exactly.\nAnother example. Let\u2019s say your\nsports club (or whatever) is going on\ntour but there are a limited number\nof places \u2013 someone couldn\u2019t rig the\nACC this year. So only the best (Insert\nsport here)-person gets to go. This is\nbasic biology. When there is competition for a resource, what do trees do?\nThey grow, and those that grow that\nextra metre up, or across, or wide are\nthose that make it. You don\u2019t need me\nto tell you that university is a fiercely\ncompetitive forest. Just by coming\nhere, you\u2019ve already beaten sone competition already. So the lesson here is\nto start photosynthesising like your life\ndepends on it!\nFurthermore, some trees even need\nthat extreme pressure to survive. The\nseeds of the Giant Sequoia are only\nreleased from their pine cones in the\nintense heat of forest fires. Without\nthe conflagrations, the seeds don\u2019t germinate and... do sod all, basically. And\npeople are just the same. Some write\nirritatingly good essays the night before the deadline after months of idle\nindolence.\nBut it\u2019s not just their general philosophy that I admire. Just look at what\nMan and Tree have both contributed to\nsociety over the years. Trees have given\nus medicines like quinine and aspirin,\nwood for houses and guitars, fruit for\nfood and clothing. I could go on. What\nhas Man made? Fire, axes, chainsaws.\nAs a species, we\u2019re really quite aggres-sive. One of these days it\u2019s going to get\nus into trouble. So it\u2019s clear that trees\nhave done much more for us that we\nhave done for them. Rather decent of\nthem.\nBut am I right in comparing humanity to trees? Are we compatible at all?\nWe\u2019ve all seen those tree-huggers, and\nwhile I admit their motives are admirably pure, those kinds of relationships\ndon\u2019t tend to last. So just keep your stamens to yourselves, boys, kay?\nBut I\u2019m not just being speciest. Even\nwith the most futuristic of medical in-novations, you\u2019ll be lucky to live past a\nhundred years. To a tree, that\u2019s noth-ing. That\u2019s tree puberty, when they\nstart growing moss in places that didn\u2019t\ngrow moss before. Trees can grow\nfor thousands of years \u2013 providing\nsome passing human isn\u2019t in need of\na tooth-pick. In fact, it\u2019s thought that\nthe world\u2019s oldest tree is more than\nsix thousand years old. To put that in\nperspective, when the Egyptians first\ndecided that pyramids were a pretty\nnifty shape, this tree was already going\ngrey at the roots. So yes, as a rule, trees\nmake Methuselah look like a mayfly.\nMy point is that trees can afford to\ntake their time over things.\nWhat is a little argument with a little man when you can remember the\nlast time druids climbed your trunk?\nThere\u2019s no point in getting worked up\nwhen you can outlast almost anything\nelse on the planet. Except fire. Run\nfrom fire.\nBut us humans can\u2019t afford to take\nour time like that. Our time is short.\nCarpe Diem, and all that. If we sat and\npondered for a decade over every little\ndecision, society would grind to a halt.\nSo, in conclusion, it appears that\nwhile trees have a valid, even admira-ble, life philosophy, it is not one that\nman should seek to emulate.\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to\nleave...\nRhys Davies just can\u2019t argue with trees\n\u201cAs a species,\nwe\u2019re really quite\naggressive. ...it\u2019s\ngoing to get us into\ntrouble.\u201d\nI\nn my Monday morning lectures\nthere\u2019s a ten-minute break in the\nthree hours of unending pain,\nand during this time one of the\nstudents likes to go and get a\ncoffee. Without fail, he comes back\nten minutes late each week. As I am\nmore anal than a particularly uptight\nhaemorrhoid this irritates me greatly,\nand so next week I will attempt to fashion a landmine out of a bottle of wa-ter, a multivitamin tablet, and some\nthumbtacks.\nAnyway, this itself isn\u2019t the point,\nthe point is that this chap also likes to\npretend he\u2019s one of the financial establishment\u2019s elite young minds. He reads\nthe financial times and pretends he\nunderstands it, rather than admitting\nhe just likes doodling stickmen on the\nlittle graphs and charts, and he talks to\nhis friends about \u2018the problem with the\neconomy\u2019 as if he\u2019s discussing something he has an iota of experience of.\nHe\u2019s basically like everyone else in the\nfinancial sector, it\u2019s just he\u2019s within spitting distance of me and that makes him\nstand out more.\nI only mention him because this\nweek it\u2019s Imperial\u2019s favourite seven days\nof pretending to be something we\u2019re\nnot \u2013 no, not environmentally sound,\nthe other one. It\u2019s ArtsFest! Ooh. Just\nsaying it makes me feel like I\u2019m in an\nenergy drink advert circa 1985. Me\nand Gilead Amit are in shell suits with\nwacky hair and there\u2019s some cheap\nhand-drawn special effects in the back-ground. I look slightly more effeminate\nthan he does, but no-one\u2019s really ask-ing. We rock out for twenty seconds\nand then shout something about the\nSherfield building. Cut.\nEveryone likes to show off what extra\nskills they have \u2013 why else would we\nwrite CVs \u2013 but ArtsFest just seems\nthat one step too far, when Imperial\nconspires to show everyone that we\u2019re\njust as good as the other kids. Look,\nyou say, we\u2019ve got at least thirteen different kinds of saxophone societies.\nWho needs arts degrees. We\u2019ve got all\nthe arts we need right here, you say, and\nthen you grab your crotch a bit. Insecure? Us? Would a university who was\ninsecure have three separate societies\ndedicated to interpretive dance? I think\nnot!\nI jest, of course. We actually have\nfour. And I really love the arts and music stuff we\u2019ve got at Imperial; the IC\nBig Band is my first good memory of\nImperial (I recorded their performance\nin my Fresher\u2019s week like some nineties\nbootlegger), and there\u2019s a lot of good\nscience going on at Imperial that relates to art in some way or another. I\u2019ve\nbeen talking to one academic in particular lately \u2013 who challenged me about\nwriting this column which I completely\ndenied at the time, apologies if you\nknow who you are \u2013 who\u2019s got some\ngreat work going on in that area. And\nthat\u2019s fab. Honestly. I\u2019d even go as far as\nto use the ancient slang word \u2018fab\u2019. I just\ndid, in fact.\nBut Imperial is full of people who\nreally wish they weren\u2019t here, and it\u2019s\na little bit sad. In most cases, really\nsad \u2013 most of the Felix staff should be\nout there right now replacing the birostuffed-up-a-pig\u2019s-arse journalists that\nare currently working day and night to\nmake all forms of news completely un-readable. Unfortunately, most of them\nare going to end up stuck in dead-end\nscience and engineering jobs, pretending to give a shit about tensile stress\nand high energy states. So I see ArtsFest as more of a distress call than anything else. Maybe that\u2019s more important than, you know, a steady job?\nWhat do I know, though, eh? I can\u2019t\neven manage a weekly column at the\nmoment.\nWrite for Comment! Make your voice heard. Or, rather, read. Like this. comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Her name was misprinted as Tina.\nSans lightsabers but armed with quilted\nprotective clothing \u2013 Louise Goldin, a\nfashion forward winner and a Topshop\ncollaborator \u2013 spent months in an Italian factory creating hexagonal-shaped\ndresses and cotton armour complete\nwith padded bullet proof panels.\n*******\nApparently Carine Roitfeld flew in\nespecially for this man. His dresses\nincorporate highly charged sexuality\nin your typical suit fabric. Panels\ntwist and turn to confer some serious\nstructure and sophistication. Natalia\nVodianova graced the catwalk for this\nuntil now, relatively unknown designer.\nLOUISE GOLDIN\nSTAR WARS\nWOMEN\nSOLDIERS\n********\nHAKAAN\nSERIOUSLY\nSTRUCTURED\nbeautiful chiffons printed with\nmushrooms. A collection full\nof originality and wit, Karen\nBonser even managed to take\nthe distinctly un-fashion-y oilcloth fabric and cut it into a\ncovetable fitted utility jacket,\na fully-fledged transformation\nof a well-loved country classic.\nModels were clad in thick cable\nknit thigh-high socks in various muted tones of grey, khaki,\ncream and blue paired with\nfurry pom-pom adorned patent\nboots, unthinkably incongru-ent yet perfectly matched. For\na show so full of imagination\nand ingenuity, it comes as no\nsurprise that Katie Grand was\nat the helm of the styling team.\nAlice Palmer received similar high praise over at Vauxhall\nFashion Scout \u2013 themed \u201cBatman\u201d, her collection was set in\na tight monochrome, complete\nwith studs adorning the very\ncovetable black leggings, exaggerated shoulders a-plenty and\na stunning studded black all-in-one fit for a modern-day domi-natrix Catwoman \u2013 all atop\nheels complete with deadly silver spike spurs. Finding inspiration in the advanced engineering of the Batmobile, Palmer\nbrought strength and stealth\nto her signature knitwear, with\nsexy cutouts of bare skin to contrast with the powerful lines.\nAn innovative collection fit for\nthe coolest punk-rock rich kids\nover in Gotham City.\nFor a much-needed bit of\ncolour, one never needs to\nlook any further than Matthew Williamson. Structured\nand cocooned coats in sumptuous tweed with flouncy fox\nfur arms concealed the tell-tale\nMatthew flashy print, peeking\nthrough the layers. It\u2019s not that\nMatthew has entirely crawled\nout of the primordial ooze of\nexplosive colour which constitutes the essence of his brand\n(as already mentioned, flashes\nof his instantly recognizable\nshowy mini dresses and blindingly bright, heavily embellished chiffon and silk frocks\nfor the tanned and toned on the\nred carpet are still there aplen-ty) but he seems to have finally\nput one foot on the shore, once\nagain building on his aesthetic,\ngrowing and experimenting,\nafter multiple seasons where it\nfelt like our boy had plateaued.\nWhile his flirtation with colour blocked separates (a magenta wool coat, suede peach\nslouchy jacket worn over a\ntangerine silk jersey draped\nevening column) isn\u2019t exactly\navant-garde in the traditional\nsense of the word, it is indeed\nsomething new for Matthew.\nWhilst he may have pared it\ndown to cater to newfound BFF,\nultimate Park Avenue Princess\nOlivia Palermo (squarely affixed in the front row), with his\ndeployment of boiled wools in\n(gasp!) muted tones with the\ntell-tale prints lurking beneath\nevery seemingly demure layer,\nmanaged to do so in a way\nwhich adheres to his designer\nDNA. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all\nabout to survive the rat race\nagainst mother nature that is\nthe fashion industry: survival of\nthe fittest, evolving what works\nfor you personally in harmony\nwith what works for the world\naround you.\nThe sentiment was echoed\nover at Clements Ribeiro, featuring metallic brocades, fur\ndetailing and beautiful little\nprinted silk dresses, wonderfully cut and paired with the most\nbeautiful embellished boots.\nThe colour scheme was kept\nmainly to muted blues, greens\nand browns, amalgamated into\nabstract prints and paisleys.\nHowever, over on the catwalks of one of the leaders of\nthe print revolution, Mary Katrantzou showed her signature\ncollection of kaleidoscopic digital prints. Rococo frills, jewels\nand opulent colours dominated\nMary Katrantzou\u2019s fabulous\ncollection, going totally against\nthe stream of stark minimalism\nseen at many other shows. Taking elements from both male\nand female portraits from the\n18th century French period, including the jewellery, military\nmedals and sashes of opulent\njewel-toned fabrics, Katrantzou\ncreated an incredibly beautiful collection full of interesting asymmetric lines and lace\nappliqu\u00e9 over the prints \u2013 an\nintelligent move, for fashion\u2019s\ncurrent love affair with the\nprints needs to be secured not\nas a novelty, but a serious and\nimportant part of fashion\u2019s\nhistory. Indeed, it is crucial to\nremember that Alexander McQueen was also at the forefront\nof this print revolution and that\ntiring out such a vital part of his\nlegacy would be an utter disre-spect. Mary Katrantzou, I salute you for keeping it fresh and\nbeautiful.\nAll in all, my key tips for next\nAutumn/Winter are: for colour,\nkeep it classically monochrome\nbut add deep colour tones in\nplum, navy and terracotta and\nmuted abstract prints, unless\nyou\u2019re brave enough to sport a\nmaximalist Katrantzou print!\nAdd metallic touches with studs\nand plenty of chunky metal jewellery and keep your textures\nvaried, adding a little leather and\nthick swathes of fur into the mix.\nCapes of all shapes and sizes will\nsoon be coming to a high street\nnear you and shoulders are going\nto be bigger and better than ever,\ngoing above and beyond the\npuny 80s power-shoulder that\nis now so two seasons ago. Fetish-inspired wares will also find\ntheir way into the mainstream\nwith harnesses, cage-work and\nstudding being featured so heavily in the shows.\n\u201cAlice Palmer\nrecieved high\npraise and\ncreated a\nmodern-day\ndominatrix\nCatwoman...\u201d\nI could get\nused to\nthis!\nSaskia Verhagen\nSaskia Verhagen\nT\nhings I\u2019ve checked off\non my list of things\nto do once in my life:\nhearing first hand\nwhat La Roitfeld thinks of the\nAutumn/Winter trends?

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk NEWS FEATURE\nChloe McKeon is final year Biologist currently\njuggling her time between applying for jobs,\nboosting her 2:2 average to a 2:1 and making the\nmost of her ever-decreasing time at university.\nShe\u2019s hoping to become an accountant when she\ngraduates this June.\nDo you feel the job market is only open to people\ngraduating with a 2:1?\nFromtheimpressionI\u2019vegot,yes.Afterapplyingtoover\n30 companies, I\u2019ve only come across one offering jobs\nwith a 2:2 standard. They all specify the requirement\nat interviews and ask you if you\u2019re on course for a 2:1.\nYou definitely get the impression they\u2019re not going to\nconsider anyone else.\nHowmuchdoyouthinkthefactyou\u2019refromImperial\nCollege is taken into account when applying for\njobs?\nI think they do notice the prestige of Imperial. They\nmention it at interviews. I think they look upon you as\nbeing academic and having all the skills you need in\naccountancy jobs. Though, that doesn\u2019t relate to\ngetting a 2:1. Just because you\u2019re from Imperial,\nyou still need that grade.\nWe work really hard to get here, and most\npeople come here to get a job at the end of it.\nWe then have to work hard here, and that is\nmentioned by graduate recruiters, but I\u2019m not\nsure it\u2019s valued enough.\nDo you think going to another university would\nhave increased your chance of getting the jobs,\nsubsequent from being able to achieve a 2:1\nmore easily?\nIt seems like an even playing field, but it\u2019s not. I\nhave friends that studied Biology at universities\nsuch as Cardiff or Exeter, and they\u2019ve said that\nmost of their first year was just a re-cap of\nA-Levels. Biology at Imperial isn\u2019t like that at all,\nand I don\u2019t think that\u2019s reflected when applying\nfor jobs at all.\nGetting a 2:1 from Imperial is probably as good\nas getting a 1st from some universities. I feel the\nperson with a 1st would probably get the job, but\na 2:1 from Imperial is still extremely competitive.\nA 2:2 from Imperial can\u2019t compete with a 2:1 from\nanother university; there\u2019s too much of a gap and\nbarrier considered by employers between a 2:1\nand a 2:2 classification overall.\nStudent in the process\nGetting a 2:2 isn\u2019t the end of the world, by any means\nI\nn November 2008, then Union President Jenny Morgan and student representative Alex Grisman were invited to\nthe College\u2019s Strategic Education Committee meeting where they proposed\na paper discussing the value of an Imperial\ndegree. It said that the \u201crespectable classification of a Lower Second\u201d from Imperial ought\nto stand a \u201cbetter chance of securing employment than it already does.\u201d The suggested\nadvancement on this point was to talk to the\nCollege\u2019s careers service and urge them to\npress the point to major graduate recruiters;\nthe companies most guilty of using a 2:1 cutoff point.\nfelix spoke to Elspeth Farrar, Director of the\nCareers Advisory Service, and she has seemingly listened to the suggestions put to her\nsince then, and has been lobbying companies\nlike PwC to give a lot more attention to the\nreputation of the institution applicants are applying from.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to encourage companies to look\nfor more than a degree classification. Looking\nat just that is limiting, but you can understand\nwhy they do it. They receive thousands upon\nthousands of applications.\u201d\nWhen asked what advice she would give to a\nstudent that is only on course for a 2:2 degree,\nher words were clear and simple. \u201cDon\u2019t panic!\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a misconception that\nall graduate recruiters ask for a 2:1. In fact, at\nleast 34% don\u2019t even specify.\u201d She continues to\nassure students on lower classifications that\nthere are specialist and smaller companies not\nlooking for a 2:1. \u201cEngineering and public sector companies often require a 2:2, and smaller\ncompanies are more interested in the individ-ual. Students with a 2:2 shouldn\u2019t be thinking\n\u2018life is over\u2019 or anything.\nHer advice to 2:2 gradutes is not to apply to\njobs clearly stating a 2:1 requirement. \u201cA lot of\nstudents suffer from this tunnel vision of what\nthey want to do and who they can apply to, we\nencourage them to broaden out their\nvision,\u201d she says. She mentions about\n45% of job offers are subject-unspecific,\nand many recruiters look for an \u201centire\nskillset\u201d rather than just a certain degree.\nMs. Farrar also found it difficult to agree\nthat degree quality and standards across\nthe country were incomparable and vary-ing. \u201cThe demand for Imperial students\nis high, but you need to look at where the\napplicant has come from at the start of\nthe degree and what they\u2019ve achieved by\nthe end of it. There\u2019s also plenty of reasons why many students can\u2019t attend the\nbest university on offer to them.\u201d She also\npoints out that to say an Imperial student\nis immediately better than a student from\nanother university is difficult.\n\u201cA student at another university may\nhave achieved much greater things,\nyou\u2019ve got to see what they\u2019ve\ngained from the experience.\u201d\nElspeth Farrar, Director of Imperial\u2019s Career Advisory Service talks about the value of an\nImperial degree, and what 2:2 graduates can still do despite under-achievement\nIs an Imperial degree more attractive to employers?\nUniversity of Ulster Imperial College London\nOverall ranking (TGUG)\nBiological Science subject\nrank ((TGUG)\nContact hours\n% of 1st of 2.1 awarded\n(TGUG)\nGraduate prospects indicator\n(The Guardian)\nProgramme Learning\nOutcomes\n(Numbered extracts taken\nfrom online programme outcome\nreports are from equivalent\nspecifications within the report)\nBSc Hons Biology with DIS/DAS BSc in Biology\n3\n3\n18.18 per week\n68.5 (32nd place)\n84\n54\n37\n17.5 per week\n61.4 (56th place)\n63\nThe comparison is taken between Imperial and the University of Ulster, universities from both ends of the university\nleague tables.The degrees chosen are equivalents of each other, and are chosen as broad pure science subjects that\nmany employers hold in high regard; as they are thought to have plenty of transferable skills into graduate-level\njobs. E\nxternal Examiners reports are effectively the way in\nwhich universities ensure that their course standards\nare comparable to those of other universities. These\nreports also aim to ensure that students receive similar\ngrades, had they studied at a different university. However,\nin spite of this, often there are often still discrepancies in\nthe difficulty of examinations set between universities resulting in students achieving lower grades here than they\nwould at, say, the University of Ulster.\nIn these reports often external examiners touch on the fact\nthat our students are part-taking in more difficult courses.\nFor instance between 07-08 and 08-09 the number of first\nclass degrees in Biochemistry dropped from 22% to 7%\nhowever an external examiner remarked that the \u201cstandards\nachieved are similar to those on comparable programmes at\nother institutions\u201d. However, other comparable institutions\ngenerally have much higher rates of firsts and 2:1s than Imperial. Imperial has a \u201cgood honours\u201d rate of 68.5% compared with a rate of 80.4% at UCL (ranked 5th) and Sussex\n(ranked 35th) with 81.7%. - Renny Norman\nExternal opinion\n1.
