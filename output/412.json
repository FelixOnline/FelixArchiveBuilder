    "content": "_\u00a3fi iX_11 RUGBY\nInto the final\nCROSS COUNTRY\nNo nas ties aid\nnavigation\nON SUNDAY a motley\ncollection of colds, hangovers,\ngirlfriends and a dog journeyed\nto North park Wood near\nPu I borough for the saxons\nclub event. The network of\npaths, the lack of dense\nundergrowth, gorse bushes\nand other nas ties, made the\ncourses very fast. However\nsome of the controls were\nawkwardly sited in pools,\nditches and under plank\nbridges. So Alan Leakey, who\nhad his control card pinned\nto his chest, had to assume\nsome od'-i postures, not\nnormally associated with\npeople in their right minds,\nin order to punch his card.\nIn spite of this disadvantage,\nAlan finished 5th on the\n8.7km' A' course in 69mins, which is his highest ever\nposition in senior competition.\nRob All in son also did well\nto finish 9th, only half a minute slower; this was also\nhis best ever placing. On\nthe B course, 6.6km, Ian\nI sherwood showed great\nimprovement over previous\noutings and came 30th in\n92 mins. Len Fawcett also\nimproved in coming 17th on the C course; 4.9km, in\n71 mins. The two crosscountry stalwarts, Steve\nWebb and 'Iron Man' Pete\nJohnson, acted with great\nchivalry (possibly under\norders), and took the soft\noption by escorting the\nladies round the C course,\nto give them a gentle\nintroduction to the sport.\nSteve and Karen completed\nthe course in 91 minutes,\nbut Pete and Jo were less\nsuccessful. They were\naccompanied by Nell, the\ndalmatian who narrowly\ndefeated Mike We I ford in the\nelections for club mascot.\nAfter a good start, they\nwasted a lot of time after\novershooting one of the\ncontrols, and eventually\ndropped out after completing\n80% of the course, because\nof the rapid approach of\nclosing time. They have\nhowever high hopes of\ncompleting courses in the\nfuture given earlier start\ntimes. Nell did not enter\ncompletely into the spirit\nof the sport: at one point she\nrefused point blank to walk\nthrough some brambles and\nhad to be carried.\nTechnically the hardest\norienteering of the day was\nin finding the nearest real\npub, with inadequate directions\nand map. Only one of the\ncars completed the course\nin time, significantly the car\ncontaining the most successful\noriente ers and determined\ndrinkers. They were rewarded\nby some fine King and Barnes\nale.\nMeanwhile David Rosen\nwas having a busy weekend\nin the North. On Saturday he\ncame a very close2 nd as\nan Oxford past competitor in\nthe Varsity match near\nBlackburn, and on Sunday\nhe came 4th in the snow at\nthe Delamere trophy event\nnear Macclesfield in a high\nclass field.\nFinally on Wednesday\nthe 25th Feb, the club are\nholding an event in Richmond\nPark. Anyone remotely\ninterested in orienteering is\nvery welcome, and this event\nis particularly suitable as\nan Introduction for beginners.\nA party will leave the Union\nat 1.00pm, for further details\nsee the club notice board, to\nthe right of the stairs in the\nUnion main entrance.\nImperial College 1st XI 14 QMC\nIC'S First\nDefeat\nA run of successes was\nbrought to an end when IC\nDarts Club lost last Tuesday.\nThis was a return match after\nIC had already won an\nexciting game at COL P.So, IC started confidently and\nmanaged to win the first\ngame of 1001. However\nIC started to slip and after\ntwo games of 501 were 2\u20141\ndown and following the\ndoubles were still one down\nat 4\u20143. Everything depended\non the singles and the\npressure was on. As is\ncustomary, so it seems, the\ncaptain lost the first single\nafter starting slowly. The\nsecond single also went\nCO LP's way when Neil was\nunable to get the finishing\ndouble after leaving his\nopponent at the start. After\nthis things started to improve\nfor IC until again we were\njust one behind COL P at\n7 - 6 . However after a very\ngood try Liz was unlucky to\nlose, so giving the match to\nCOL P, through no fault of\nher own. Paula won the\nlast game as a consolation\nto give the final result of 8\u20147.\nTeam: M Gibson, N Rust, J Ford, J Halsey, A Slack, Ian,\nL Macklnnon, P Whitlock.\nMike Gibson I A must for every rugby-blooded person. IC 1st XV have reached the Gutteridge\nCup Final on Saturday\n28th to be played at Motspur\nPark after a14 \u20140 victory\nagainst QM C. Before the\nreport, a big 'thank you' to\nall the supporters out there\nat Harlington to cheer us on.\nAfter 'My Son Paul' won\nthe toss IC played against the\nwind (although it was mostly\nacross the pitch). The' first\nten to fifteen minutes was\nthe kind of start to any\nsemi-final, crunching tackles, with no side dominating\ncompletely. The height,\nweight and strength of the\nIC team began to tell us the\nhalf progressed with fine\nclearance kicking by the\nbacks.\nIC began to put the smaller\nQMC side under more and\nmore pressure and the\ninevitable score came after\n25 minutes. ' Massive' Keith\nLipscombe absorbed a clearance punt in his gut\nfrom three yards, shrugged\noff at least three tackles\nand slipped the ball to Phil Turley who powered over\nthe line for an un converted try.\nThe game then came alive\nand IC were on the boil as\nnever before this season.\nGreat ruc king by the pack\nIC won four consecutive\nloose ruc ks and completely\ndisorganised the Q MC's defence. The backs moved the\nball quickly 'Martin Bo-cock'\nbeat his man drew the\nwinger and fed Zappa on\nthe wing who darted through\nfor the second try.\nIC were really on top\nnow and shortly afterwards\nthe third try was run in.\nAn overlap developed from\nnothing and Mark West on\nthe other wing scored the\ntry. The conversion made the\nscore 1 4 - 0 and for the last\nten minutes QM C were given\nheart as IC sat back on\ntheir lead, going badly off\nthe boil up to half-time.\nThe second half was a disappointment, with a weakened QM C pack matching\nIC who did enough to stop\nthem scoring but could not\nbreak through to score\nthemselves.\nTeam: B Finney, M West, M Cotter, B Stern, A Williams, A Devaney, T Fearn, R Doyle, B Austin, I Maclain, S Booth,\nK Lipscombe, J Smith, P Robins (capt), P Turley.\nCrushed by Colts\nImperial College A's0 Streatham and Croyden Colts:22 THIS WEEK the A's travelled\nsouth to play the Streatham\nand Croydon Club's colt side. They turned out to be a youth side. Having won the\ntoss, the A's elected to play\nup the (about one-in-four)\nhill, the idea being to defend\nin the first half and then to\nuse the hill for an attack in\nthe second. As it turned out\nthe A's spent seventy\nminutes in defence! The best\nlaid plans etc etc.\nThe first try came early.\nThe ball was won in the\nscrum but bounced free\neluding two A's players,\nbut, unfortunately, not the\nStreatham player who scored* That was converted. Another\nmistake enabled Streatham to\nstretch their lead to 1 0 - 0 at\nhalf time. The A's were\nlooking forward to playing\ndown hill, but alas it was\nmore downfall than down hill\nfor the A's. Before the A's could exploit the advantage of\nthe slope another try had\nbeen conceded. However, the\nteam did not give up and there\nwere long periods of intense\npressure most of which were\nwithstood by the A's. John\nThomas, had a good debut,\nat scrum half, saving the\nsituation many times by\nhis accurate passing.\nIronically, the A's looked\nmore threatening in this\nhalf but, nevertheless,\nwere continually pinned\nback by the good kicking of the Streatham side.\nSo, in the end there was\ndefeat. But never mind the\nscore, the A's put a lot- of\neffort into the game, and,\nalthough it was not such a good team performance as\nlast week, the A's were not\ndisgraced. John Day had a good game at hooker in\nspite of being kicked in the\nhead by Rich Jenner early\nin the first half. Steve\nDowning has also earned\nhimself a complimentary\nmention.\nThe memorable event of the\nday was when the reason for\nthe delay of the departure\nof the team from the Streatham\nclub house was discovered.\nThey were all upstairs\nwatching 'Doctor Who'.\nTeam: R Pullen, G Davles,\nC Becque, M Gibson, L Dawes, D Turner, J Thomas,\nW Bubb, J Day, R Oyler,\nC Cutherbertson, S Downing,\nR Porter, R Jenner, J Flshburn.\nChris Cuthbertson\n\n"

    "content": "1\n2 FILIX\nIC cruise to victory\nThis is a story of nineteen\npots, twelve hats and tee\nshirts, nine ties, two trophies\nand a harp. It all took place\non the river at Reading\nwhere the IC Boat Club won three of the six events\nand collected the above\nmentioned items.\nThe days racing began\ndisappointingly with the\nNovices losing a hard fought\nrace against Reading by a length and a half. Reading then\nwent on to win their two\nother races easily, so in\nfact, the novices did quite\nwell. The second eight had\na field day; they won all their races by more than\nthree lengths. Racing against\nReading 2nd VIII Rob Quinn\ntook the crew all the way\nround the outside of the\nfinal bend, a sporting gesture\nfrom a crew which was eight lengths ahead. This rather set the pattern of\ntheir day.\nRowing in on outsize boat\nthe ladies lost to Cambridge\nsecond eight who went on to\nwin the final easily. Another\ncase of an IC crew meeting\nthe eventual winners in\nfirst round.\nThe firsts* went for a warm up before the race. As they came in a Balliol oarsmen was heard to remark\n'I suppose that's their\nfifth eight and they still\nlook better than the (Oxford)\nblue boat'. The first heat\nwas against Reading 1st who\nwent a length up at the\nstart but IC, in a slightly\nuneasy stride came back\nand gained a length. An uninspiring race followed\nand the firsts won by a length\nand a half. In the final\nthey met Balliol and Oriel\n('I thought Oriel was a soap\npowder until I went to\nReading'). The three crews\nwere still level after the\nstart and during the stride,\nIC pulled away from Balliol and after a good solid row\nbeat Oriel by three lengths.\nWhen Andy Bay I is passed\nthe finishing post in the\nsculling competition, the\njudges had to be reminded that\nthe race was still in progress\nbecause two minutes later\nhis opposition came in\nsight. Later Andy turned back\nup stream to finish the outing.\nAs promised, Phil s' party at the Boat house turned\nout to be a Memorable\nOccasion with much merriment\nand swimming.\nCrews :-1st Bow: MR Jones\n2 J Fitzgerald \u2022\n3 J Lewis\n4 J Bland\n5 J Skrypnuik\n6 P Langguth\n7 S Worley\nStroke: I Hyslop\nCox: J Kirkpatrick\nNovices\nBow: P Church\n2 M Jones-Gerrard\n3 N Westgarth\n4 S Howie\n5 C Southwell\n6 Tony Dean\n7 S Carlson\nStroke: A Barbut\nCox: S11 man Sculler: A Bayles\n2nd Bow: M Johnson\n2 T Thomas\n3S Hackett4 R Hale\n5 R Newley\n6 W White\n7 J Scoular\nStroke M Tyler\nCox: R Quinn\nWomen\nBow: Sue James\n2 Brenda Ness\n3 Janet Downs\n4 Jean Maskell\n5 Sue Smith\n6 Isobel Pollock\n7 Claire Hodgson\nStroke: Gerry Taplin\nCox: Nigel Williams\nEver So Quick! FOLLOWING last week's article \" When, Oh When\", Miss Pamela Johnston, the\nUnion Receptionist, has\nbeen transferred from her\nposition in the hallway of\nthe Union Building to the\nUnion Office. Immediately\nFELIX was released, it\nappears, a worker was sent\nto \" size up\" the job, and by\nWednesday the telephone\nhad been transferred. She\nmoved to her new desk\nyesterday (Thursday).\nAll messages for RC Cs,S CCs and A CCs will now be\nleft on the noticeboard outside\nthe Union Office, not, as, previously, in the Lower\nLounge.\nPam said of the change:\n\"/ feel like a new girl now.\nBut it's obviously a be lter arrangement \u2014 Jen and I can\nhelp each other out now. I think I 'll miss the 'Wednesday\nPardade' of sports teams,\nthough.\" She will now have\nfive telephones to contend\nwith: \" / am sure that one\nday they will all ring at\nonce.\"\n(We apologise for both\nconfusing Miss Johnston's marital status and misspelling\nher name in the last week's article.)\ncontinued from front page\nNo To Disaffiliation\npossible.

Replying to the statement\nthat organisations such as\nthe Federation of Conservative\nStudents wished to remain\nin NUS, he pointed out that\nthese were political bodies\nwhich wanted political power. To those people who\nwanted to stay in because of\nthe services such as\nEnd sleigh, he said that\nthese services were available\nto most members of the\npublic. Concluding, he conceded\nthat students needed a Atonal negotiating body,\nbut one which was respected,\nand political. Several members spoke\non the motion, including\nMr Nigel Miller, a presidential\ncandidate, who thought that\nd is affiliation would be a cat a strop' iy\". \u2022Last chance GONE!

    "content": "Military coup-Alfs\narmy take over ICU\nWould anybody care? \u2014 it seems not.\nPortugal is seized by frenzy at the .\nprospect of a free election in two months.\nBack at IC, the prospect of an election\nin two weeks is greeted with a buzz of\nactivity and enthusiasm that makes it\nseem like Waterloo Station during a rail strike.\nWell I suppose we have had free\nelections for quite a while now \u2014 the\nmyst i gue is bound to wear off. DidI say free elections? What is free about\nan election where the President,\nHonorary Secretary and Deputy President\nget their posts purely by virtue of\nhaving over 20 people willing to\nsign a piece of paper.\nThe contest for president is really\nhot ting up. Will it be Nick Brayshaw or\nwill it be \u2014 oh! \u2014 she' s gone. Fiona McGregor made a valiant but short\nlived opposition to the Brayshaw\nwalkover which gave a few people\nsomething to talk about for a while, not least, Mr Brayshaw Unfortunately,\nafter further consideration of her\npresent situation, Fiona had to withdraw.\nSurely, there is someone else about\nIC willing to stand for the posts of\nHonorary Secretary and President \u2014\nsurely there are a few who would\nwelcome a year away from academic\ntoil to play at politics. Is it just that\nthe \" big names\" already standing are\ntoo daunting a prospect for the humbler\naspirants to higher echelons of internal\npolitics? Is this really a college calling for\nthe democrat is ation of NUS? We have not\nhad a quo rate union meeting for years.\nAll decisions on behalf of the 4500\nmembers of the union are taken by a sub quo rate body of activists at UG Ms or else by that arbitrarily representative\nand motley assembly \u2014 IC Union Council If our own attempts at direct\ndemocracy are so dismal, will not\nNUS go the same way? Is it IC students\nthat need taking up or IC Union? What\nwe need is a representative democracy.\nOr will Alf' s army solve the problem\nby dropping their facade of fighting\n\" high\" Christianity and reveal their\ntrue metal by taking over ICU. Back to the present. I forgot to\nmention the election of the sabbatical\nsentence shuffler for this weekly\nmasterpiece. There, at least, there is strong competition by budding journalists\nfor this demanding and rewarding job.\nI hope you will all turn out and vote\nto give us a competent editor.\nLooking slightly further ahead, there\nis the little matter of finding people to\nfill the other officers posts. It is to be\nhoped that we can start next year with\na full set of officers \u2014 even a bureaucracy\ncannot run without its bureaucrats.\nWhich reminds me, if anyone has a keen interest in education and the way\nit is conducted at IC and in spreading\nthe new gospel in the alternative\nprospectus or if they have illegible\nhandwriting and cannot spell\" academic\", \"What is free about an elect ibn where the President, Honorary\nSecretary and Deputy President\nget their posts purely by virtue\nof having over 2 0 people\nwilling to sign a piece of\npaper?\" - Richard Parker\nthen they ought to think about the all action job of Academic Affairs Officer.\nBernard Shaw said - \" Democracy substitutes election by the incompetent\nmany for appointment by the corrupt\nfew\". Here we substitute selection\nfrom a competent few with proscription\nof an unopposed one.\nRJ PARKER ICU A AO continued from page 3\nManifesto: Hon. Sec.\nCandidate:\nJOHN WHITE\nProposer: CHRIS WEB BORN hard way, from the front. IC UGM's are functional though it seems that\nthere is something desired in terms of\na hook. The average IC student (is\nthere such a thing?) is not interested\nin the troubles of this, that, and the.\nother, he is more worried about the\nproblems facing himself. In this light\nwe should endeavour to bring UGM\ndiscussion/debate/policy home, back\nto IC and the troubles of little Fred,\nthe budding technologist, in his daily\nplight of student-type existence.\nWhilst on the subject of UGM's,I believe the mode of communication for\nsuch meetings could be improved\neven more, possibly even utilising\nthe already present multitude of year\nreps.\nI believe that it is very important\nfor the Secretary, as with all senior\nofficers of ICU, to be widely known\nand accepted throughout College. I feel that I have achieved this and it\ncan only help me in the job.\nIt is much better to know the person\nwho you have to see over some matter\nrather than having to see the Union\nSecretary \u2014 a ghostly spectre residing\nin the uppermost rickety tower of\nthe Union Building.\nTo finish may I say that a lot of\nhard work and real interest is demanded\nin order to carry off the job of Secretary\nand that I am prepared to apply myself\nto these ends.\nMusic\nThe Eddy Boy Band\nHeavy-duty rock\nAnd this week's Doobie \u2014 transplants\nare known as the Eddie Boy band. It's only apparent at the start, where\n\" Oh so hard\" has a somewhat overbearing resemblance to those finger-lickin' sons of the Lone Star State.\nTrack two \" The maze\" moves into\n\"Chicago' territory with some solid professional playing and very smooth\nguitar work by Mark Goldenberg. After\na few minutes though a sort of poppi sh tedium swamps the proceedings as the ideas quickly dry up. They can maintain the power and pace of these\nearly numbers through side one, as is obviously expected of them but the\nquality suffers inthe good old tradition\nof countless other duff bands searching\nfor the break that will turn them into\nbona-fide superstars like Hello or\nSlik (or is it \" sick\"?). They' ve got\nlittle if anything more to offer your\near balls than is easily available in\nany reasonably sane platter emporium's racks.\n\" Good to have you back again\", starting side two is another worthy power\nblues with a good hook and marginally\nbetter solo by the aforementioned\nGolden boy, but this album's a pretty\nunspectacular addition to the recent\ncrop, with the band restrained to well\nwithin their operating envelope, and as such don't pretend to be other than\nyer actual heavy-duty rock 'n boogie\noutfit. They' ve probably spent aeons\nsocking it to would-be Allman s audiences\nand for this unnatural devotion to\nduty have been given the opportunity\nto get an album out.\nOn the whole, an above average,\nunpretentious release from the \" Chicago rock group of the year 1 9 7 4 \" . How prestigious that particular accolade is remains doubtful I(I always thought\nChicago a home of the blues) but it's better than the poor B CR's\" Turkey of\nthe year'' award.\nNote: There are actually 2 minutes of\nkeyboard subtlety on a song called\" Mother Music\" sounding comparatively\nrefreshing.\nThe Fremlin\nCup\nIC Open Singles\nDarts Competition\nEntries are now being\naccepted for this competition\nwhich is a knockout. The\ncompetition should be completed\nthis term so entries will be\nopen until February 28th. These should be given to the\nstaff of the Union Bar. The\nentrance fee is 20p( lOp to\nDarts Club Members).\nThe winner will be presented\nwith the Fremlin Pot which he\nretains for one year and will\nbe engraved with their name.\nATTENTION ALL DARTS PLAYERS "

    "content": "\u00bb FELIX\nELECTION Candidate:\nPresident NICK BRAYSHAW\nProposer: KEITH AHLERS AS MOST OF YOU will, by now, have\nheard, I am standing for the post of\nImperial College Union President for the\ncoming academic year 1976\u201477. However,\nwhat many of you may not be conversant\nwith, are my reasons for standing for\nthe post, and what I would like to achieve during my year of office.\nFirstly, I would like to explain my\npresent position within College and\nwhy I consider I am the best suited\nperson for the job at the present time.\nBeing president of aCC U involves me\nin a great deal of Union business, both\nas a representative of my own Union, and also as a VicePresident of Imperial\nCollege Union. As an ICU VP, I am of course a member of the IO Executive, IC Council, IC Union Finance Committee, and many\nmore committees too numerous to mention,\nbut all giving me an invaluable insight\ninto the running of a large and complex\nbody such as ICU. Also, I spend a great\ndeal of time on Imperial College business, such as refectories, bars, athletics,\ncareers advice etc and consequently\nhave come to know almost all of the\nCollege administrators by working with\nthem. This is an invaluable aid in ful-filling the job of ICU President. Another important point is that I am\nwell-known around College and so I am\nable to keep (and be kept) in touch\nwith student opinion rather than being\nan ivory tower admins i strato rf Next, I have listed the points on which\nI should like to see ICU interested in/not\ninterested in during the coming year\n(not necessarily in order of merit):-(i) In order to make Imperial College Union more appealing to IC students it is essential that ICU concerns itself with\nthose issues which are of importance and\nrelevance to the student body. In this way\nI should like to see ICU become more\ninterested in the problems of students as a whole, particularly IC students. Whilst\nnot suggesting that ICU should become\ncompletely insular, I believe that problems\nencountered by groups and countries which\nare not of direct relevance to IC students\nare ones which should be of secondary\nimportance to a students union.\n(ii) Due to the fact that grants are fixed\nannually, I feel that ICU must oppose\nany mid-session al increases in College \u2014\nprovided facilities( eg refectories, hall\nand house rents) as this puts undue\nfinancial pressure on students. In order\nto prevent these mid session al increases\nbecoming necessary, ICU most pressing\nfor concerted efforts to minimise hall and\nhouse rents and also for increased\nstandards in the refectories, in order to\nincrease custom and make them a financially\nviable proposition within IC.( iii) NUS has become a topic of\ncontroversy within IC recently and the\nquestion has arisen whether we should\nremain affiliated or not. This is a very\ncomplex question with much deeper\nramifications than at first appear, such\nas \"If all the moderate colleges pull out\nof NUS, then NUS will become even more\nleft-wing than at present\". Although my\nfinal opinion on NUS must be governed\nby the opinions expressed at aUG M, it is\nmy considered opinion that the most\nfruitful policy for ICU to pursue is one\nof instigating radical changes whilst\nremaining within NUS, and in this way\nwe will continue to benefit from the\nservices provided by NUS, and at the\nsame time trying to alter the structure\nof the NUS hierarchy.\nAs well as the points I have outlined\nabove, many more topics are of critical\nimportance to IC students, but to hear my\nviews on other topics, you will have to\ncome to the Hustings Meeting and ask\nthen, when I will be only to glad to\ngive my opinions.\nFinally, all I can say is that I am\nreally keen to do this job and if elected,\nwill work for the benefit of IC students\nto the best of my ability.\nCandidate TONY FITZGERALD\nBefore considering any candidate for\nthe presidency one must first consider the\nwork of a President. One of his main\nfunctions is to represent the students of\nthe college on a large number of\ncommittees, within both ICU and the\nCollege administration, wherein he must\ngive the \" student opinion\". As Departmental Representative for Physics, in which Department I am a third year, I have gained experience of working\nwithin committees, both those consisting of students only, and those having\nacademic staff and administrators as\nmembers. Also I have had the very\nnecessary experience of sitting on\nCouncil this year. It, is obviously\nimportant that the views put forward on\nProposer: STELLA GODFREY these committees are those of IC students.\nAs a political moderate, who has proved\nhimself approachable enough to represent\nstudent opinion within his department,\nI think I would be able to represent the\nmajority of IC students.\nIn his role as \" chief executive\" of\nthe union, the President is the main\ninstigator of discussion within the\nunion on matters relating to its policy, and, as such, must again be responsive\nto student opinion. Areas which I think\nare relevant to IC students and my\nopinions on them are laid out below. NUS, forms a major issue at the\nmoment and, whilst it is unrepresentative\nof student opinion, remaining within a national representative body is in our\ninterests, in my opinion. In this way we\nshould strive to change any policies we disagree with from within NUS \u2014 this\nbeing obviously impossible from without.\nConsistent with this, I should like to\nsee the External Affairs Officer's work being expanded. Internally, I would\nlike to see more done in Academic Affairs, with a unification of what is\nconsidered, at the moment, largely a departmental matter. Also, much of the\nwork on committees would be aided, by\na discussion of the issues to be raised, in FELIX, at UG Ms, and on a personal\nlevel before the committee meets and I would consider the generation of such\ndiscussion a major priority. Moreover, this\nwould mean that UG Ms would be more\nrelevant to the individual students in\nthat there would be more discussion of\ninternal matters.\nAnother important facet of the\nPresidency is the social one, in that\nhe must attend a large number of functions\non an official basis. In addition, he\nshould meet and be receptive to as\nmany students as possible during the\nyear. My penchant for \" social chat\" would make this part of the job less onerous. However, I am lacking a qualification held by one of my opponents\n\u2014 I have never been to an RSM Ball! In conclusion, I would like to reiterate\nthe necessity of electing a President you\nfeel can represent your views. HUSTINGS\nThurs 26 th Feb1 OOprn in the Great\nHall.

DON'T FORGET TO VOTE.r iii x7 MANIFESTOS Nigel Miller is a first year chemist,\nwho, nevertheless, is not completely\nnew to politics. He was previously a representative of Assistant Scientific Officers in the Harwell branch of the\nIPC S( Civil Service Scientists' Union)\nfor a year. He writes of this:\n\" The situation there was similar in\nmany ways to the situation amongst\nstudents here. Apparent apathy and\ndisillusionment with the \" left wing\" Union beau roc racy was a symptom of\nthe fact that, as for students here, the\nnational executive of the union seemed to\nbe preoccupied with various adventures\nwhich seemed designed more to satisfy\nthe whims of the beau roc rats than to\nserve the members' interests. This was\nfor the IPC S, as it is for the NUS,a result of the difficulties of organising\na group of people who have no real\neconomic power in the way that people\nworking in productive industry have.\" In order to combat this weakness, we\nneed a student leadership which understands it, and knows how we must\ntherefore act. We must build a strong,\nunited, and democratic NUS, and reject\nadventurers the Right and the far-Left\nI believe my leadership can do this.\nUnion meetings should be better\npublicised in all the college media, and\nshould be on issues of importance to\nstudents. Only this can the Union\ninvolve its members.\nI shall give full support to the media,\nIC Radio, STOIC, and Felix, and seek to\ninvolve as many students as possible in these, if necessary by being controversial so that students must use\nthe media to reply. I shall work for\nmore democratic control of them,\nbecause, after all, it's your Union, and\nyour media, and it is you who should\nrun them.\nWith the present inflation, we need\nhigher grants every year to meet the\ncost of living. I shall ensure that IC's opinions are voiced in the grants campaign\nand that it is effective, without\nunnecessarily ant agonising the public. The campaign will be organised to hit\nhome just how badly off many students\nare, and, should negotiation fail, will not simply accept this.\nTwo other issues are closely tied in\nwith this \u2014 the abolition of the \" means test\", and the high fees charged to\noverseas students. Many students\nreceive pitiful grants, and their parents\neither will not, or cannot, afford to\npay the parental contribution. Also we\nhave many foreign students at the\ncollege, who have to pay much higher\nfees than UK students, and who face\nsocial problems that the rest of us do\nnot. The recently announced fees\nincreases are a complete disaster for\nmany overseas students, who will find they cannot afford to pay them.\nThis can only result in a contraction\nof the college and the closure of some\ncourses. If you elect me as president,\nthe Union will do its utmost for people\nwho are hit in there ways, and will campaign against the causes. Only if we resist there attacks can\nIC retain its high academic standards,\nand only thus can IC continue to be\nrecognised as a place of learning,\nwhose qualifications will stand us in\ngood stead in years to come.\nIf this is what you want, vote Miller\nFor President Miller for NUS. Remember, M FP Candidate:\nSep.P res. DERRICK EVERETT\nProposer: RICHARD PARKER How I See The Job\nTHE POST of Deputy President is one\nof the most important and demanding\nin IC Union. The DPs main function\nis to supervise the use and maintenance\nof the Union facilities, for example,\nregarding the booking of rooms and\nthe repair and replacement of furniture\nand fixtures. He is also responsible\nfor the maintenance of discipline and\nfor prosecuting offenders. The DP is in charge of safety and has a watching\nbrief over the refectory and bar. The\njob also involves responsibility for\nother matters such as the safety of\nthe Union mascot\nWhy I Think I Can Do The Job\n' During my mis-spent time at IC,I have taken a constant interest in\nthe Union and spent a considerable\namount of time in the Union building,\nnotably in the refectory and bar. Over\nthe last year I have been External\nAffairs Officer of ICU and in that\ncapacity I have been inyo l ved with\noutside bodies such as the NUS. I am at present a member of the Student\nRepresentative Council of the University\nof London Union and Vice Chairman of the Western Area of the London\nStudents Organisation. Within I CUI have of course chaired the External\nAffairs Committee and served on other\ncommittees and on Council. My experience\non the Union Finance Committee\nshould be of particular use of a Deputy\nPresident. I believe that my experience\nof Council and committees should\nenable me to cope with the bureaucracy\nof the job, which I hope I can reduce\na bit.\nI hope that during my year as DPI shall be able to get more students\ninvolved in one way or another with\nthe Union and using its facilities, and I hope that those facilities can\nbe improved. *'\nCandidate:\nNIGEL MILLER\nProposer: HUGH BARRETT1 Candidates who have stood for\nany of the ICU posts since the\npublication of this issue of FELIX may put in a manifesto by Monday\n23rd Feb for publication in the\nnext issue. A Word About Politics As well as the functions of the\nDP outlined above, I hope to make a useful Contribution on the Union\nExecutive and on Council. I would\nalso like to continue with the work\nI have started this year in the NUS because I think there is a great deal of work which must be done to improve\nthis organisation; and by that I do\nnot mean replacing the present dominant\npolitical clique with a different one.\nFor those of you who are interested,\nmy \u2022 own political \u2022 views are fairly\nstraightforward Liberalism. I. believe in free trade, the mixed economy,\nrepresentative democracy, the freedom\nof the individual and I advocate a federal Britain in a Federal Europe.\nI am opposed to any increase in the\npower of the state such as is advocated\nby the extreme left and by the extreme\nright.\nI want to see a grant for all students\nsufficient to enable them to study\nfor 52 weeks in each year. I would\nlike to see NUS do more for specific groups of students such as Overseas\nstudents, who are a large proportion\nof* students at this college, and for\ndisabled students. I am quite prepared\nto answer any questions you might\nhave about politics at the hustings;\nsee you there!\nMANIFESTOS\nManifestos for the posts of FELIX Editor and Honorary Secretary can be\nfound on page 3.\n\n"

    "content": "4 MU X Legal Aid-at court\nEnglish courts are divided\ninto civil criminal courts. The\nScottish system is similar.\nCivil courts\nMost civil cases are heard\nin the County Courts. Each\nof these covers a certain\narea of the country (not\nusually a county l). They\ndeal with disputes over\nitems worth less than \u00a31,000\nand possession actions on\nmost houses and flats. The judicial work is carried out\nby a circuit judge and a registrar, who doubles as an assistant judge and\ndeals with small claims. Small claims (less than\n\u00a3100) may now be brought\nwithout a lawyer. You pay\n\u00a35 which is returned if you\nwin the case. The High Court Situated\nin the Strand takes any case over the County Court\nfinancial limit. Appeals from\nthe County or High courts go,\nfirstly to the Court of\nAppeal, and then, finally to\nthe House of Lords. Criminal courts\nCriminal proceedings begin\nat a Magistrates' Court. This Court will have a bench of\nthree lay magistrates, or in\nlarge cities, one full-time\npanel magistrate. Se(io us cases are committed to rail by\njury at the area's Crown\nCourt either automatically\nor at the accused person's request. The Central Criminal\nCourt (the Old Bailey) deals\nwith major trials and cases where the person might get\nan unfair hearing locally.\nTribunals\nDue to the length of time\nof court procedures, tribunals\nhave been set up to deal with\nsuch problems as supplementary benefit appeals, rents and\nnational insurance. These\nare intended to be quick and\ninformal and are not in\ngeneral judged by a professional lawyer.\nLawyers\nThe legal profession is\ndivided into solicitors and\nbarristers. Solicitors are\nmembers of the Law Society\nand can appear in Magistrates\nand county courts but not in\nthe higher courts. Barristers\ncan appear in all courts, but\nare not allowed to deal\ndirectly with a client. They\nmust be \" instructed\" by\na solicitor. All barristers\nare members of one of the\nInns of Court and their\nprofessional body is the\nGeneral Council of the Bar. Judges in the Crown and\nCentral Criminal courts are\nusually barristers.\nCivil legal Aid No legal aid is available\nfor tribunals. To obtain\nlegal aid at a civil court, you\napply for a\" legal aid cert-if i cate\" through a solicitor.\nThe application is considered\nby the local committee of\nthe Law Society. They will consider whether you have\n\" reasonable grounds\" for\nbringing or defending the\ncase. There is a right of\nappeal to the Society' s area committee if you are\nturned down.\nFinancial eligibility\nDisposable capital and\nincome are worked out in a similar fashion to the legal\nadvice scheme described\nlast week. That is, disposable\nincome is equivalent to\ngross income less allowances\nand disposable capital is\nequivalent to gross capital\nless debts.\nIn this case, however,\ndisposable, income is calculated on a yearly basis and\naid is not given if this\nis greater than \u00a31,580 per\nannum. Aid is only free if\nyour disposable income is\nless than \u00a3500 per annum\nand your disposable capital\nis less than \u00a3250. Above this\nyou pay a contribution.\nThe maximum value of this\ncontribution is calculated as the amount by which your\ncapital exceeds \u00a3250 plus\na third of the amount by\nwhich the disposable income\nexceeds \u00a3500 a year. Should\nthe actual costs fall below\nthis sum, the balance is\nreturned to you, while if the\ncosts are higher, the balance\nis paid from the Legal Aid Fund. The contribution is\npayable in instalments.\nIf you win the case and\nare awarded costs, part of\nyour contribution may be\nreturned. Alternatively, if\nyou lose and costs are\nawarded to the other side,\nyou may be asked for an\nextra contribution. Moreover,\nif you win and the total\ncosts are quite considerable\nor you are awarded damages,\nand not costs, the Legal\nAid Fund has the right of a \"Statutory charge\" from\nthe damages you receive.\nCriminal Legal Aid This is only available to\npersons charged with a criminal offence and not to\nthose prosecuting. The financial limits are not\nquite as restrictive as in the\ncase of Civil Legal Aid although one is still liable\nto a means test. To obtain\ncriminal legal aid you apply\nfor a\" legal aid order\", either to the clerk of the\ncourt itself. After assessing your means, the court will decide whether you are\nliable to pay a contribution\nor not.\nFrom then on you are\nentitled to the services of\na solicitor and barrister\nif required. The solicitor can\nbe of your own choice.\nThe legal aid order also\nincludes advice on appealing\nif found gui It y. Finally, anyone charged\nwith an offence would\nimmediately seek legal\nadvice either from a solicitor,\nCitizens Advice Bureau or\nLaw Centre. Please contact\nthe welfare Centre for useful\naddresses, more information\nand if you wish to talk to the\nUnion's Solicitor. We are\nopen 12.30 \u2014 1.30pm, Mondays\nto Fridays, at the top of the\nUnion Building. Sue Kali c in ski Peter Patter\nLETTER\nDeprived of\nUnion facilities\nSir, \u2014 We wonder, on the\nday that Pete Teague is\nquoted as saying \" the Union is for students\", the depth to which this\nstatement extends.\nLast Friday night we\nwished to play snooker on\nthe Union tables, but we\nrated our chances low,\nbecause the tables are\nalways in great demand;\nbut hope! the lights were\noff. What chance lay on\nthe horizon? None, the\nDP, Mr (IC is a cliquish College) Shakir, had had the\ndoors locked because of\n\" flamboyant\" behaviour by\nthe Snooker Club. We were deprived of\nUnion facilities owing to a personal grudge between\nthe DP and certain members\nof the Snooker Club. Should this situation be\ntolerated in a students'\nUnion, should such action\nas that of our refurbished\nDeputy President go un reported in FELIX? We think not.\nWhen challenged, in the\nUnion Bar, Mr Shakir said\nWhat an Increase!\nThe Finance and Executive\nCommittees of the Governing\nBody will be deciding, as you read this FELIX whether\nto increase the college\ntuition fees and by how\nmuch. The Department of\nEducation and Science has\nrecommended an increase in\nfees of thirty percent, and\nthe College is almost certain\nto follow this guideline.\nThis will mean that next\nyear the fees for undergraduates will be \u00a3211 for\nUK students and \u00a3426 for\nOverseas Students, increases\nof \u00a346 and \u00a396 respectively.\nFees for postgraduates will be ten pounds less in each\ncase. If the College does not\nincrease the fees next year\nthen they will loose that\namount of money from their\ngrant from the Universities Grants Committee, as they\nwill assume that our fees\nhave gone up. Does the\nCollege have any choice\ntherefore? The total income\n\" the innocent always suffer\". Yours faithfully,\nJ LATTER, C MILLS. CE3 to the College from student\nfees was only 2.8% of the\nCollege's total income. The\nmajority of this money is\npaid by local authorities,\nforeign governments, or the\nBritish Council. Self \u2014\nsupporting students pay their\nown fees and this makes up\nthe balance. These students\nwho come from both the\nUK and Overseas are the\npeople hit hardest by any\nfees increase. Could the\nCollege waive the fee increase\nin the case of self-supporting\nstudents. The students\npaying their own fees number\nabout 1,000 and their fees\nrepresent about 0.7% of the\nCollege's income.\nThe loss of income to\nthe College is quite small, but the hardship caused to\nstudents paying their own\nfees will be considerable\nparticularly if the hardship\narrangements which operated\nlast year are not continued\nfull v this v ear. Breakfasts and Weekends\nThe Refectory Committee\nhas decided that a change\nin breakfast and weekend\nworking is required to try\nand put these services on a more economic basis. The\nchoice available at breakfast\nwill be more limited and\nthe service will be moved to\nthe snack bar in southside. To\ncut costs on the weekend\nservice, it is intended to\nchange to a snack service\nsimilar to that provided in\nthe Union during the week.\nThis will mean that less\nstaff need be employed and\nhence cut costs. I hope that\nyou will make full use of\nthese new ideas, particularly\nas the refectory intends to\nstay open for much longer\nat weekends.\nElections\nPerhaps I should not say\nanything as I was elected\nunopposed but the lack of\ncandidates is really appalling.\nI am pleased to say that\nthere are now several candidates\nfor President and FELIX Editor but the Hon Sec and\nDeputy President Elections are still unopposed. If you\nfeel that you could do the\njob then stand!! If you\ncannot be bothered to put\nout a campaign and spend\ntwo weeks trying to get the\njob, then you do not deserve\nit.\nPeter Teague\n\n"

The voting was\n195 to 146 to stay in with\n63 abstentions.\nThe meeting, attended by\nnearly 450 students, was the\nlargest of its kind in recent\nyears. The motion discussed was in two parts, the first\nnoted the unrepresentative\nnature of the national union\nand the second expressed\nthe view that d is affiliation was the only way to ensure\nthat NUS. becomes more\nrepresentative of the student\nmembers.\nThe first part of the\nmotion was overwhelmingly\ncarried.\nIan M inn is, President of\nAston Univers U y Guild of\nStudents, who was originally\ngoing to speak in favour of\nd is affiliation, did not turn\nup because of a misunderstanding over the time at\nwhich the debate was supposed to begin.\nHe was replaced by Peter\nTeague, ICU President, who\ndebated against Charles\nClarke, NUS President.\nMr Clarke opened the\ndebate amidst much heckling\nand began by reiterating the\nproblems facing students\nand cited the NUS's record in\ndealing with them. Only\nNUS, he said, could organise\na national, concerted effort\nto affect Government policies. Admitting that, at the\nmoment, NUS were \" on the\ndefensive\", he stated his belief that \" by organisation\nstudents can change things\". \"It was no accident\", he pointed out, \"that NUS is\nthe strongest student union\nin Europe. Britain is the only\ncountry where student loans\nare not given. We are living\nin a society where instability,\nnot stability is the order\nof the day. Things which up\nto now have been taken for\ngranted,are being challenged\",\nhe said.\nOn the question of\ndemocracy within NUS, he\nemphasised that this\ndepended crucially on the\nrepresentative nature of\nindividual student unions.\nThe only way to change NUS was from within these\nstudent unions, by the\ninvolvement of all members\nin campaigns.\nMr Teague, in his reply\nsaid the NUS was inherently\nunrepresentative because of\nits structure. The organisation\nwas based on \" active democracy\". Only political activists attended the\nnecessary UG M's and\nconferences, so only the\nopinions of these activists\nwere represented.\nCriticising the domination\nof the NUS executive by the\nBroad Left, he blamed the\nwidely publicised political opinions of the national\nexecutive for the bad\npublic image of students.\nHe believed that students\nneeded a national negotiating\nbody, but this body should\nbe apolitical as far as continued on back page\nRCS recover shields\nICWA challenge Exec\nICWA hereby challenge the\nImperial College Union\nExecutive to a pancake\nrace round the Beit Quadrangle\non Tuesday 2nd March at\n1.00pm, the match to be\nrefereed by the FELIX Editor, Paul Ekpenyong.\nChris ' Morrell with the\nTHE SIX GUILDS shields\nstolen last term were returned\nto the C&G Union last night\nduring the RCS sketch at the\nGuilds Revue.\nThe shields, valued at\nover \u00a32000, were recovered\nfrom a locked cupboard in the University College Union\nby members of the Royal\nCollege of Science Union\nlast week.

Refectory\nservices\nslashed\nTHE BREAKFAST and\nweekend meals services in\nSouthside are to be drastically\nreduced in an attempt to\nreduce the refectory deficit.\nThe decision was taken by\nthe refectory committee under\nthe chairmanship of Dr J F Levy, after much discussion with Mr Mooney, the refectory\nmanager.\nMr Mooney put several\nproposals to the committee,\nwhich the committee decided\nto implement. As a result,\nfrom Monday 23rd February,\nonly one cooked dish will be available for breakfast\n(eggs and bacon). This will enable a reduction of staff\nand a consequent saving of\nmoney.\nFrom Saturday 28th February, the weekend meals\nservice which, at present is making a loss of \u00a375 per weekend, will be reduced.\nThe full scale menu will be\ndiscontinued and in its place a menu similar to that\noffered in the Union refectory\non week days will be sub-st it u ted. Here too, ft is hoped to reduce kitchen\nstaff and save money.\nThe new service will require the purchase of a convection oven and more\nstorage space, the total cost\nof which is expected to be\napproximately \u00a31000.\nLabour charges are the\nmain factor in the cost of\nrunning the refectories,\nhence it is in this area\nthat economies are to be\nc once nrt a ted, but there may\nbe friction with the Union concerned over reduction in staff.\n\n"

    "content": "FILIX 3\nELECTION MANIFESTOS TESiSSC Editor\nCandidate: CLIVE DEWEY Proposer: MIKE WILLIAMS CLIVE DEWEY is a third year mathematician who has spent the\npast two years heavily involved in\nstudent journalism. This year he has\nbeen ICU Publicity Officer, consolidating\nhis exp ere ince on offset-Iitho.\nTo do this very demanding job,\nthe Editor of FELIX must in my view,\nhave certain prerequisites. Firstly, the Editormust be technically com pen tent. He must have a far-reaching knowledge\nof offset-litho \u2014 its advantages,\nlimitations, versatility, drawbacks,\neverything. Secondly, the Editor must\nbe au fait with how both the Union\nand the College function. He must be\nmore than familiar with the structure,\nhierarchy and the bureaucracy of both\nIC and ICU. Additionally, the Editor must be\na competent writer, and it helps\nimmensely if he is familiar with the\nmultitude of personalities, characters,\nindividuals which make up the College and the Union. I believe ( live Dewey fulfils these\ncriteria outstandingly and better than\nany other candidate. His technical\ncompetence speaks for itself if you\nhave seen the excellent Union publicity\nwhich he has produced. It is by far\nthe best publicity the Union has seen\nin a long time. His involvement in the\nUnion in the past two years can hardly\nhave gone unnoticed. He has often\nobserved on Council, regularly attends\nUGMs and his involvement in IC Radio has taken him to the depths of\nthe Sherfield Building. He has written\na great deal for Sennet, which gave\nhim a very valuable insight into student\njournalism. He is familiar with the\nvast majority of Union and College officers. Just look at his list of\nsecond ers, if you get the chance. Despite the differences that he and\nI have had in the past, it remains\nabundantly clear to me that Clive Dewey is the most capable candidate\nfor the job of FELIX Editor. As an\nex-Editor myself, I feel a very simple\nmoral obligation to support the candidate\nwhom I feel is going to do the best\njob.\nActing in the best interests of\nFELIX must transcend all personal\nconflicts. By doing so, one is acting\nin the best interests of the Union; and\none will be furthering those important\ninterests by voting for Clive Dewey. Mike Williams, FELIX Editor 1974-75\nBriefly, under my editors nip would like FELIX to become a regular\nsixteen-pager, with a weekly four - page\nEnts/ Arts pull-out supplement. This would include the Wotzon column.\nMy fairly extensive experience in\ngetting advertising would hold me in\ngood stead; \u00a3100 a week is not pie in the-sky when you know how to get\nit, and that is what I intend to do.\nMore in-depth features, more copy readers, and better layout are other areas of\nplanned expansion. However, the\nfirst priority will always be news, more\nof it, and more follow-up stories. To conclude, if elected, I shall\nmake FELIX better than ever. That's a promise.\n, u DUNCAN S USS Candida\nProposer: MARK CALDWELL MANY PEOPLE think of the Editor as\nthe person who produces FELIX. This is only partly true, since he relies\nheavily on the co-operation and good\nwill of two paid staff and the voluntary\nhelp of students.\nDuncan Suss has the support of\nall this year's FELIX staff. They have\nall agreed to remain with the paper if\nhe is elected. At the start of every\nyear a hard core of experienced staff\nis essential \u2014 without them the\nproduction of the paper would be\nseriously hampered. For this position, past experience of how FELIX runs is necessary. Duncan has contributed\narticles to FELIX; as technical assistant he gained an intricate knowledge of\nthe problems and techniques of offset\u2014\nLitho printing, and as Business Manager\nhe has acquired the necessary abilities to run the paper's finances and\nadvertising.\nDuncan has many new, practical\nideas, which if implemented would\nimprove the quality of your paper.\nMore importantly, he has the commonsense ability to carry them out. His unpretentious approach, coupled with\na realistic understanding of what is\npossible, makes him the ideal choice\nfor next year's Editor.\nMark Caldwell, Chairman of STOIC. TO FULFILL ITS ROLE, FELIX must\nreflect the interests of its readers.\nA good coverage of student affairs\nis essential, particularly on those\nmatters which concern students directly,\nsuch as refectory prices and hall fees. Room must also be found for\narticles on clubs and societies so as\nto arouse interest in them and ensure\ntheir continued existence. This would\nalso encourage local businesses to\nadvertise in FELIX \u2014 if a feature on\na particular club was planned, any\nsuppliers in the district could be\napproached with more confidence in\nthe, at present, unfavourable climate.\nIt is also important that both overseas\nstudents and postgraduates be encouraged\nto contribute more to FELIX. After\nall, they each constitute well over\n20% of the population of IC. The lack\nof a regular article for overseas students\nhas been a noticeable failing of this\nyear's FELIX,, and in the last five\nissues, only one article has been\nspecifically related to PG s. So, my plans can be stated quite\nsimply:\n(1) to maintain the support of the\nabsolutely crucial staff of FELIX,(2) to encourage students' societies\nto utilise FELIX to a greater extent, and\n(3) to make students more aware of\nthe issues which affect them.\nAll of these objectives are realistic, all can be achieved, and all of them\nwill benefit FELIX and ICU. Hon.Sec\nCandidate:\nJOHN WHITE\nProposer: CHRIS WEB BORN THE POST of Honorary Secretary of\nICU is basically administrative; rather\nthan having policies of his own, his duty is to be servant of the Union and\nhe exists to carry out the wishes of\nthe UGM as Union Administrator.\nThe experience I have gained as aCC U VP, with an active interest in\nICU, has, I believe, equipped me for\na job of this nature. I have played\nan important role on many committees\nand consequently I am very familiar\nwith the type of work and coordination\ndemanded of a Union Secretary.\nUnion meetings I have dealt with\ntoo; I have learnt about these the\nContinued on page 10\n\n"

    "content": "mix9 Reviews\nCinema\n'Man Friday' ('A' Carlton, Haymarket.)\nDON'T BE FOOLED by the jolly\nposters and jokey radio ads \u2014 the\ncommercial ' Disney image' is a facade\nbehind which lurks a pretty heavy\nstory. For the benefit of those lured\nin expectation of easy-going entertain-ment, there are plenty of jolly japes \u2014\nsome of them very amusing \u2014 and the\nMexican scenery is very nice. Meanwhile,\nDaniel Defoe having been thrown out of\nthe window after the first two minutes,\n'Man Friday' reveals itself as a vehicle\nfor filming the biggest ethnic al clash of all time.\nUnfortunately the characters turn\nout to be just too black and white (sorry!).\nFriday (Richard Roundtree) comes from\nidyllic, socialist Utopia where\nprejudices, taboos, status, and even\nDefoe discarded\ncompetitive games, are in conceive able concepts. Crusoe (played by Peter\nO 'toole) despite twelve lonely years\nthinking, remains the complete antithesis\nof this: as the all-white, God-fearing,\nself-castigating master, he is determined\nto 'educate' Friday \u2014 .and remain his\nmaster. Inconsistency\" runs through\nthe film; Crusoe (who has built a stockade like Fort Knox, complete with\nautomatic drawbridge) makes a pathetic\nattempt at building a raft on which they\nhope to escape to Fridays island-predictably it sinks on launching.\nConsistently, though, the film is\nagainst all that the white-man stands\nfor, and he is progressively depicted\nas a ranting maniac; a role that Mr\nO 'toole perfected in ' The Ruling Class' but here seems like over-acting.\nThe turning point comes at the\nend of a long tirade when Crusoe,\nscreaming about the white-mans'\n\" vile, purple body\" to a fettered\nFriday, blows his previous only\ncompanion, the parrot, to pieces in\nmid-squawk. From here on, the white-man's malignancy spreads to Friday, who turns the gun on his 'master' and\nforces him to build another boat \u2014 this\ntime a sea-worthy one. Together they\nsail to Friday's island, but fearing\nhe might influence their children, he is\nrejected by the tribe, and returned to\nresume, once again, his solitary\nexistance on the island.\nSo ends another saga; one that I enjoyed, but would have enjoyed all\nthe more had it reached its potential\nand been constructive rather than\ndestructive.\nDavid Thompson\nConcerts\nBoys of the Lough and Richard Digance in the Great Hall\nDouble-jigs and curious rhythms\nCAT HOL O' CONNELL, Robin Morton,\nAli. Bain and Dave Richardson are four\nof the best traditional musicians in the\ncountry. Individually they are superb.\nTogether they are \" The Boys of the\nLough\". Cathol plays flute and whistle, and\nhas a fine singing voice. Dave Richardson,\na Tynesider, plays stringed instruments banjo, cittern and mandolin \u2014 and\nsometimes doubles with Robin on\nconcertina duets, or when Robin plays\nBobhran (Irish hand-drum). The last\nmember of the group, Ali Bain, a Shetland fiddler, is probably the best\nknown of the four, and is generally\nconsidered to be one of the best fiddlers\nin the country. Other than what is\nabsolutely essential to make themselves\nheard, they use no electronic gadgetry,\nand they play music the traditional\nway, without altering tempos or imposing\nheavy rhythms.\nThe audience was small, but\nenthusiastic, and the Boys quickly had\nthem warmed up with a couple of\ndouble-jigs. In the first set, it was\nmainly Cathol and Ali playing their\nway fast and furious through reels and\nflings, but time was found for a March\ntune from Al i's native Shetlands, with\nits curious rhythm and intricate\nharmonies.\nThen came Richard Digance, a singer / songwriter/ song-introduce r WANTED\nFELIX\nSTAFF!!\n(not necessarily in that order) who\nmanaged quite successfully to bore me\nto death with his intros and revive me\nwith the noise output of his songs,\n(hence the phrase \" loud enough to\nwaken the dead\"?). Not really my cup\nof tea, but the audience seemed to\nenjoy him, and all joined in on his\nfinal song, \"Working Class Millionaire\". By way of returning the compliment,\ne joined in with the audience, walking\namongst those between the stage and\npermanent seats, looking rather like\na cockney Ghandi.\nThe highlight of the Boys' second\nset was undoubtedly \" The Mason's Apron\", when first Cat hol, and then\nAli, went into variations on the theme\nand produced some of the best music\nI 've heard. Also notable, was the\npiece that they \"put together\"\nthemselves, \" Hound and Hare\", the\nstory of a hunt. In this, Robin opens\nwith two verses from a hunting song,\nfollowed By a jig to portray the pre-hunt warm-up. A duet between Cat hol, on flute, and Ali describes vividly the\nchase, capture, and finally, the kill. A marvellous concert for those who\nlike traditional music - those who\ndon't might do so now if they went to\nthe concert. They were called back for\ntwo encores - what more can you say?\nDuncan Suss\nENTS EVENTS\nKURSAAL FLYERS\nin concert in the Great Hall\ntomorrow. 8 . 0 0 pm. Tickets\nfrom IC Union office.'\nTheatre\n\"Not Spaghetti Junction Again\" Chieveley Theatre\nA long road\nto perfection\nThis week I 've been to see a new\nplay by the budding Welsh playwright,\nArthur Williams. As in his three previous\nplays, Williams presents the predicament\nof a man beset with all the problems\nthat living in the 1970's entail. In\nhis first play, \" The Living Lake\" the hero's washing machine overflows\nand floods his maison et te in Paddington.\nin his following two plays the hero\nsuccessively was stranded in the\nmiddle of a remote village in west Wales\nwhen his car's fan-belt broke and\nwas unable to attract the stewardess'\nattention on board a British Airways Jumbo as it sped towards Johannesburg.\nWhilst his earlier plays have some\nautobiographical element in them,\n\" Not Spaghetti Junction Again\" is\npure fantasy. The anti-hero is the\ndriver of a sixty-foot articulated lorry,\ndoomed for ever to drive the motorways\nof Britain in search of the perfect\nservice station meal. In his travels he\nmeets others with a less fastidious\nappetite, eager to sample the delights\nof Fortes. These hitchhikers provide\na fresh dimension in a play which could\notherwise appear very boring; they\nare able to bridge across the hard\nshoulders of the motorway and provide\na basis for meaningful relationship as\nShunt applies himself to his relentless\ntask. Can it be pure coincidence that\nhis cargo is of frozen chickens? This is the story of one man's struggle against temptation on to the\nB roads of life, and although he takes\nseveral plunges towards them, it is\ngiving nothing away to say that he does\nnot end up betraying his personal\nHighway Code.\nThomas Stevenson\n\n"
