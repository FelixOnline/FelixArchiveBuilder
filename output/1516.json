    "content": "FEATURE\nFELIX\nFriday 04 MAY 2012\n10\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nUnseen Imperial\nMore anonymous accounts of students and their experiences with depression\nT\nhere are some aspects of\nour lives that we just don\u2019t\ntalk about. This makes it\neasy to think that we\u2019re\nalone in our experiences,\nwhen in fact, we\u2019re probably not.\nLast term the Union asked the student body to submit anonymous\naccounts of their experiences of\nmental health. Once again, the sincerest of thanks to everyone who\ntook part:\nI\nn the second year of my degree\nat the College I made an appointment to see my GP, not\nbecause I had a chest infection\nor another physical complaint\nbut because of something else. In the\n6 months preceding this appointment,\nmy affect or mood had significantly\naltered, a feeling of sadness that had\ninitially waxed and waned was replaced by a persistent flatness of mood\nthat progressively became more pro-nounced, culminating in crying myself\nto sleep on most nights.\nUpon entering my GP\u2019s office, my\nresponse to her enquiring as to how\nshe could help was to burst into tears.\nShe asked what was making me feel\nlike this and I couldn\u2019t tell her. She\nthen asked whether I had been feeling\nsuicidal and I replied that I had. She\nresponded with a tremendous compassion that made me feel safe and calm,\nreassuring me that everything would\nbe alright. To this day, her gentle and\ncaring response provides great solace.\nI then filled out a questionnaire and\nwas subsequently diagnosed with de-pression, prescribed a month\u2019s course\nof fluoxetine (Prozac) and referred to\nthe Priory clinic for psychotherapy.\nMy GP implored that I inform my parents of our appointment and its out-come.\nAs I exited the clinic I felt a powerful\nsense of relief for I had finally begun\nto confront this thing that was slowly\ntearing me apart. For any person struggling with suicidal thoughts, a consistent blunted mood and/or a prolonged\ndisinterest in once cherished pastimes\nlater declined). The only thing that really helped me was being open with\nthe people that I was closest to and\nalso mediating with persons who had\ninadvertently contributed to my feelings of sadness. After letting things\nfester inside you for so long, getting\nsuch suppressed thoughts of your chest\nis incredibly therapeutic.\nI did reluctantly inform the college\nof my predicament and they responded\nwith a great deal of respect and sup-port. You will not be judged for being\ndepressed, there is a dedicated and\ncaring team who will support you in\nany event. Don\u2019t be afraid to let personal tutors etc know what is going\n\u2013 do not remain pensive and isolated\nwith these ruminations, for they will\nonly get worse and more disabling for\nyou, the moment you seek support is\nthe moment where things start to get\nbetter. Seeking support for depression\nis an immensely hard thing to face up\nto but a decision that eventually may\nsave your life.\nWhilst I have described my diagnosis in a positive light, by no means was\nthis the catalyst for a speedy recovery\nbut it did mark the start of improvements even if there were and still are\nmany obstacles. Unfortunately my\nparents did not respond in the same\nway as my kind GP and I found antidepressants really didn\u2019t help that\nmuch; they left me feeling nauseous\nin the morning, gave me an infrequent\nresting tremor, exacerbated my weight\nloss and ensured I had some rather surreal albeit slightly disturbing dreams.\nMoreover, the Priory refused to see me\nand instead referred to local services\nfor supportive counselling (which I\non, depression is a disabling affliction that negatively impacts on your\nsense of worth, your relationships and\nyour studies and the College is acutely\naware of this and will do all it can to\nensure you return to good health whilst\nstaying on track with your course.\nSince being diagnosed with depres-sion, I have experienced two further\nperiods of intense sadness, similar to\nwhen I was first sought help. During\nthese periods, a feeling of helplessness\nand weakness yet again dominated\nmy thoughts and left me feeling dis-traught. Again, in these moments of\ndesperation, speaking to loved ones\nproved to be the most effective in alleviating such feelings.\nIt has been nearly seven months\nsince I last felt depressed as described\nabove, I increasingly feel extremely\nabout positive about my life, my relationships and the future. I am now\nmore open about being depressed with\nclose friends and am more aware of my\ntriggers to feeling flat and feel confident I have can mitigate such things to\nremain contented and enthused.\nBeing depressed is a dark and lonely\nplace to be but things do get better,\nit will take time and it may not be a\nsmooth passage back to feeling like\nyou once did but once you to start to\nbe open with yourself and then with\nfriends and family, you are moving in\nthe right direction. Importantly, enduring such a consuming and debilitating\nillness will empower you with a great\nsense of empathy for the many others experiencing what you have been\nthrough, enabling you to provide a\nkind word and a tissue shoulder for\nsomeone who will greatly appreciate\nthe support you will provide.\nI have deliberately refrained from\nEmail icu-disabilities@imperial.ac.uk if you would like to share your anonymous experiences of topics that are not openly discussed\n\u201cShe asked what was\nmaking me feel like\nthis and I couldn\u2019t\ntell her\u201d\n\u201cYou will not be\njudged for being depressed\u201d\n\u201cThings do get better\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "5/4 Respect: A Tribute\nto Math Rock\nMUSIC\nFELIX\nFriday 04 MaY 2012\n20\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nMusic Editors: \u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nRoss Gray Mark England\nAlex Ramadan\nSimon Hunter\nT\nhe band is The Dandy Warhols.\nThe location is the Kentish Town\nForum. The mission? To start a\nmosh pit. My friend, a die-hard\npunk fan who is also coming to\nsee the gig remains sceptical. A band known\nfor producing radio-friendly power pop hits\nto supplement their back catalogue of psychedelic stoner rock is \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 unlikely to attract the energetic and robust crowd\nrequired to partake in behaviour traditionally\nmore suited to more aggressive forms of mu-sic.\nWe enter the venue halfway through the\nwarm up act \u2013 an electro band called AKDK\nwho are two drummers/synth players playing\narbitrary combinations of either instrument in\na largely improvised set. A little rough around\nthe edges and somewhat downbeat, the music\nitself is decent but lacks the dynamism that\ncharacterises good warm up performances.\nAfter a quick soundcheck, it is time for the\nmain event. Courtney, Zia, Pete and Fathead\nstride onto the stage, each kitted in their own\nindividual styles. There is the customary roar\nof anticipation as we await the first notes.\nWithout delay the mesmeric \u2018Be-In\u2019 serenades a swaying crowd, slowly gathering in\nnumbers. Although one of their lesser known\nsongs, it is a perfect opener, gently building\nthe atmosphere, priming us for what is to\ncome. Second song of the night is the rousing \u2018We Used to Be Friends\u2019 followed without\npause by the classic \u2018Not If You Were the Last\nJunkie on Earth\u2019, causing ripples of excitement to swirl through the crowd.\nWith over 140 songs in their arsenal, the\nDandy Warhols have the same dilemma that\nafflicts most established bands, where their\nneed to showcase new material must be balanced with the demands of fans to play the\nmore popular songs. In this regard they\nachieve the ideal blend, following a string\nof crowd-pleasers with a selection from the\nnew album This Machine. The band, and in\nparticular singer Courtney interact minimally\nwith the audience, but are always completely\nin tune with their adoring fans. A short toilet break for Zia causes Courtney to lead us\nthrough an acoustic sing-along of \u2018Every Day\nShould be a Holiday\u2019. The fact he messes up\nthe chords on the first time only endears him\nto us more.\nThe original plan for moshing seems like it\nmay not achieve fruition. Sizing up the audience it seems that everyone is either over 50\nor has come as part of a couple. Squares of\nblue pepper the audience \u2013 the ever ubiquitous\nmobile phones used to create a snapshot of the\nmoment \u2013 and my neighbour is on Facebook.\nAs if savouring the intensity of the moment is\ninsufficient without the cold proof of a picture,\na status update.\nA lone pocket of energy exists a few rows\nfrom the stage; a drunk breaking rhythmical\nconvention to leap as high as he can in defiance of the beat of the music. Seizing our op-portunity, we charge through the crowd to his\nvicinity, aided by a pack of eager 16-year olds\nlooking to prove themselves amongst adults.\nThe Dandy Warhols\nThere are around nine of us jostling in our impromptu mosh pit and while it is fun the lack\nof bodies in the pit is only serving to exhaust\nus within seconds.\nAnd then, as if our minds have been read.\nThe hush and the delicate synth intro. We know\nwhat is coming. B D A E. The four chords that\nsignal the Dandies signature tune \u2018Bohemian\nLike You\u2019. As if a beast has been awoken from\nslumber; the entire standing section one large\nconvulsing serpent. This momentum continues as the band segues into \u2018Get Off\u2019 and then\nthe raucous \u2018Horse Pills\u2019. One of the band\u2019s\nenduring talents has been their ability to transmit the mood of their lyrical content perfectly\ninto their music and live it is no different; I\nhave been immersed from the first chord.\nThe set is over, and as we are serenaded to\nthe exit by Zia \u2013 the band believe encores to\nbe fake \u2013 I feel an odd mixture of elation at\nhaving experienced such an exhilarating concert and disappointment at having it end so\nabruptly. What\u2019s that quote about leaving them\nwanting more?\nAditya Narayanan starts a mosh pit in Kentish Town\nPossibly the most original of all the bands I will\nbe covering, and by far the most influential, Slint\nfirst formed in their native Louisville, Kentucky in\n1986. In addition to reuniting for some live shows\nin 2005 and 2007, they existed for 5 years, breaking up in 1991 after the completion of their opus,\nSpiderland. Like many math bands, they are not\nseen as purely math rock, and their importance\nto other rock subgenres such as post rock, which\narguably would\u2019ve never existed in its current form\nwithout Spiderland, labels them as more than just\na math rock band, but I feel makes a point about\nthe genre itself. Math rock is perhaps not a genre\nin the strictest sense of the word. I would propose\nthat it is a sound that involves the use, primarily,\nof unusual time signatures, and often occupies\nthe more \u2018thinking man\u2019s\u2018 end of the rock spec-trum, also including influences from prog rock,\nmetal and even minimalism \u00e0 la Steve Reich.\nTherefore, many of the greats of Math rock aren\u2019t\neven labelled as such by many, for example Slint,\nwho are widely considered post-rock.\nWhat is for sure is that Slint were both awesome\nand experimental, and not a little bit bizarre. Their\ndebut album, the Steve Albini produced Tweez,\nfeatures 9 tracks, each named after one of their\nmembers\u2019 parents (except \u2018Rhoda\u2019, named after\ndrummer Britt Walford\u2019s dog). This sort of humour\nis another characteristic feature of Math rock, with\nthe instrumental bands giving their songs frivolous\ntitles, and bands with vocals, such as Slint, carrying it right through into their lyrics. Guitarist/vocalist Brian McMahan, sings, talks, samples and\nshouts his way through both albums, completely\nobliterating any monotony as well as deepening\nthe ambience of the album, particularly the spoken word, which reminds me of slowcore (another\ngenre people have tried to label Slint) titans Codeine.\nMacMahon\u2019s spoken word is often coupled with\nrepetition of riffs played on clean guitar, giving a\nhypnotic tone to the music with a sense of unease\ncreated by dischords and lyrics about alienation.\nThis builds until, often unexpectedly, distortion\ntakes over with the frequent use of harmonics\nsomewhat jarring to the listener. This shows their\nsupreme ability in storytelling and setting an at-mosphere, but this mastery of dynamics also\ngoes some way to explaining Slint\u2019s importance\nto the post-rock genre. This is a common format\nfor Slint, especially on Spiderland, but it must be\nnoted that one of the things that makes Slint so\ngreat is the variety of approaches in music and\nlyrics, sometimes clean guitar, sometimes in your\nface distorted riffing, sometimes depressing lyr-ics, sometimes light and frivolous spoken word.\nRiaz Agahi\nPt. I \u2013 Slint\nThey most certainly look dandy\nLeslie Feist at the Royal Albert Hall\nFalling in love all over again with Canada\u2019s finest\nDiogo Miguel Geraldes\nThe Royal Albert Hall was ready to welcome\nback the queen of Broken Social Scene for a\ntruly magical end of 2012\u2019s spring equinox\nweekend after M. Ward played a very pleasant stripped down version of his repertoire and\nDavid Bowie\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s Dance\u2019.\nLeslie Feist set the tone for the following\nbreathtaking couple of hours with a powerful sweep through \u2018Metals\u2019, dominated by her\nimmense vocal range and the brilliance of her\nnew work\u2019s architecture. A trip into \u2018The Reminder\u2019 split the beacon of London\u2019s live venues into an enchanting four-note backing choir\nfor \u2018So Sorry\u2019 and the upbeat \u2018I Feel It All\u2019 got\nits seating plan all mixed up for the first time\nin the evening. The flawless set then launched\ninto a rawer version of \u2018My Moon, My Man\u2019\nfollowed by an a capella rendition of \u2018Cicadas\nand Gulls\u2019helped by the crystalline Mountain\nMan. An interactive \u2018Sea Lion Woman\u2019 then\nled the set into a beautiful end dominated by\nFeist\u2019s shivering wails.\nCanada\u2019s finest voice came back on stage\nwith M. Ward to homage Jesus and The\nMary Chain before inviting the couples in\nthe public for a slow dance on stage while she\nhypnotised the remaining audience with \u2018Let\nIt Die\u2019. A third encore gave London a rendition of James Blake\u2019s version of her own\n\u2018Limit To Your Love\u2019 followed by a perfect\nending in communion with the public with\n\u2018Intuition\u2019.\nLeslie Feist has this vocal gift of tickling\nthat place inside you that gives you butterflies,\nmaking the experience of watching her live\nquite exhausting: one can only fall in love so\nmany times.\n\n"

But\noutside that one hour a week I felt totally lost.\nIt is not that none of my friends tried\nto help. Most of the ones that noticed\nthe difference in me put it down to\nexam stress and getting dumped by my\nboyfriend.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 04 MAy 2012 15\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nI\nn the recent elections one of the\nUnion\u2019s main concerns was the\nlack of postgraduate participation in the voting. However,\npostgraduate representation at\nImperial is pretty poor and it is unsurprising that they were feeling a little\nuninspired to vote. The focus should\nhave been on getting postgraduates to\nrun and thus improving representation\nin the first place.\nDuring the elections, I received an\nemail urging me as postgraduate to\nvote. By this point I had already placed\nmy votes with regards to the Sabbatical positions but had left the GSA ones\nfor another time. So after receiving the\nemail I decided that I might as well get\nit over and done with and complete\nthe rest of my voting. However, to my\nsurprise, I discovered that out of all the\nGSA positions available only one person was running. ONE.\nWell obviously the next step was\nto air my opinion on the matter via\ntwitter:\n\u201cJust got an email urging me to vote\nas a postgrad in the IC elections. Bit\ndifficult with no GSA candidates to\nvote for #voteicu\u201d\nFollowing this, I received a rapid reply from @icunion:\n\u201cThe Sabbatical team represent all\nstudents at Imperial, not just UGs. It\nis essential that PGs vote in these elec-tions! #voteicu\u201d\nWell that\u2019s nice and everything but I\npointed out that with no PG reps running there was no choice but to rely on\nthe Sabbs for representation. Unfortunately, the Imperial College Union\ntwitter account was not quite so quick\nto reply this time (I\u2019m still waiting in\nfact). Furthermore, HOW do the Sabbatical team represent postgrads. Apart\nfrom the Postgrad Mingle and a few\nemails from the Union President aimed\nat postgrads, I\u2019m unaware of any sort\nHoles in postgraduate representation\nof concrete representation. Why should\nwe have to rely on purely the Sabbs?\nAlthough they would like to think otherwise they come across as very undergraduate focused and it feels as if the\nunion elections completely overshadowed the GSA ones.\nPostgraduates have a different range\nof problems, and candidates running in\nthe elections need to make it clear how\nvoting can improve things specifically\nfor postgraduates. It\u2019s no good just\nsending emails urging people to vote.\nAccording to the email I received, I\nhave a departmental representative\nwho has been working really hard to\nimprove my student experience. I\u2019m\nreally curious as to who this entity is\nas I have never received an email from\nthem or even been informed who they\nare and how I can contact them. But\napparently they have made a really big\ndifference. I\u2019m sure it would have been\neven bigger if they had actually contacted the students they were supposed\nto represent. I must point out that I am\na Masters student in the Humanities\ndepartment so this is based on my own\nexperience rather than those in other\ndepartments or who are PhD students.\nHowever, as a Masters student I feel\nlike I\u2019ve fallen in to a big Imperial College blindspot. I didn\u2019t get to vote for\nthe GSA reps before I started and voting this year is a little irrelevant as I\nwon\u2019t be around next year. Someone\ninformed me recently that they were\ninterested in running this year but were\nnot able to as they weren\u2019t a postgraduate until next year. Basically, everyone\nwho isn\u2019t midway through their PhD\nis excluded from going for a position.\nThe elections are rerun in September\nbut any new incoming students will\nbe so preoccupied with settling in they\nwon\u2019t have much of a clue about it.\nI\u2019m lucky in that I did my undergrad\ndegree here and I was a student rep, I\nknow who to contact if problems do\narise but I\u2019m sure that new incoming\nPGs haven\u2019t the foggiest. I expect no\nmajor complaints are logged because\nthey don\u2019t know who to complain to.\nThe GSA does provide the structure\nto deal with unique PG problems but\nwhat happens now when this structure\nis clearly not effective and at the moment non-existent. The union\u2019s knee-jerk reaction to this appears to be implementing a dedicated postgraduate\nSabb. I very much approve of this idea;\nI just hope that the infrastructure will\nbe in place to support this person because otherwise they will be carrying a\nlot of responsibility on their shoulders.\nOn a more personal note, another\ncharacteristic of my MSc blindspot is\nthe fact I\u2019ve been given this title of\npostgraduate yet I\u2019m not allowed to\nuse the SCR or the Holland Club. My\ndepartment is tiny and doesn\u2019t provide\na space for me to work or relax; the\ncommon room is reserved for PhD stu-dents. I\u2019m restricted to the Library and\nother general areas, which is altogether\nthoroughly uncomfortable at times especially now in the peak of exam sea-son. A designated PG space that I, as\na Masters student, could use would be\nmuch appreciated. And before anyone\nbrings it up, yes I have put this as part\nof my feedback on the PG student sur-vey. Suffice to say, it certainly hasn\u2019t\ndone anything for my satisfaction in the\nImperial College student experience.\nElections are over now, but with only\none GSA position filled who knows\nhow successful the next round will be.\nI\u2019m sure the Union has a whole host of\nreasons as to why this situation is as\nit stands, but with student satisfaction\nbecoming one of its priorities I feel\nthat this is something that needs to be\naddressed. When this is added to the\ngrowing frustration of the postgraduate\npopulation due to the threatened closure of the Holland Club and the disposal of Clayponds, something has to\nbe done to show that postgraduates are\nstill a valued part of the student body.\nPostgraduates have\na different range\nof problems, and\ncandidates running\nin the elections\nneed to make it\nclear how voting\ncan improve things\nspecifically for\npostgraduates\n\u201c\nPostgra\nPostgra\na differe\na differe\n\u201d\nfor\nfor\ntes\nes\nVanessa Hume\nGSA elections were online, mainly because this is what the ballot paper\nwould have looked like.

    "content": "BOOKS\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nFELIX Friday 04 MAY 2012 23\nWill this book crash and burn?\nM\ny friend read this and\nraved about it to me.\nQuickly sold (mainly\nby the main character\u2019s name, Hiro Protagonist), I vowed I\u2019d read it as soon as\nI could. That was in high school. Some\nten years later, I\u2019ve finally got around\nto it.\nSnow Crash, by Neil Stephenson, was\nwritten in 1992, so even when my friend\nconvinced me to read it, it was already\na few years old. Now it\u2019s twenty years\nold, and like most sci-fi, is beginning to\nshow its age. However, that adds to the\ncharm, reading about what the future\nmight be like from the point-of-view of\nthe past. Wikipedia informs me that the\nbook is set sometime in the early 21st\ncentury and, thankfully, things have not\nturned out quick so bleak as Stephenson\npaints it.\nThe book is set in a dystopian California where national government has\nlargely disintegrated. In its place are\nbig businesses (where franchises act\nas colonies) and \u2018burbclaves\u2019 \u2013 gated\nsuburbia, each with their own law enforcement (contracted out, naturally).\nThe plot revolves around Hiro, a pizza\ndelivery boy (imagine if The Transporter had been about pizza) and a hacker.\nThe internet, as it exists in the book, is\ncalled the \u2018Metaverse\u2019 where users assume avatars to navigate by. Early on,\nI had an epiphany \u2013 Stephenson predicted Second Life a decade before it\nhappened. In the Metaverse, there is a\ncomputer virus that is leaching out into\nreality and doing to people\u2019s brains\nwhat it usually does to computers. This\nis the eponymous Snow Crash.\nReading this twenty years on, and as\na medical student, made me giggle but I\ndecided to keep my disbelief suspended\nfor the time being.\nA secondary protagonist, Y.T. is a\n\u2018Kourier\u2019 \u2013 a skateboarder/courier who\nnavigates the deadly Californian highways by harpooning other vehicles with\nan electro-magnet on a retractable ca-ble. Through her dealing with Hiro, she\ntoo is drawn into the mystery of Snow\nCrash.\nThe novel is certainly imaginative,\nwith a broad scope in mind. Through\nthe course of the book, Stephenson ties\ntogether computer hacking, neurolin-guistics, and middle eastern mythology-theology. This is on top of a fleshed-out\nworld where pizza-boys drive armoured\n4x4s, franchises run everything and the\ninternet is Second Life.\nOn reflection, this feels like a book of\ntwo halves. Half the book is heavy on\nthe action, advancing the plot at a rate\nof knots and in a very cool fashion. The\nother half feels like a very accessible\ntextbook on linguistics and Sumerian\nculture. While I found these chapters\n(mostly dialogue between Hiro and a\ncomputer program-librarian) interesting (because I am a geek like that), it\nonly struck me later that they were massive tracts of straight exposition. In fact,\nthis thought struck as Hiro reiterated it\nfor the benefit of the other characters.\nFurthermore, it would be hard to redact\nmost of this because without it, the plot\nbecomes quite shallow. Stephenson has\ntried to juggle intellectual depth with\nplot and whilst admirable, and success-ful, it is evident what he was trying to\ndo.\nFrom a purely technical standpoint,\nthe book is very readable. Even through\nthe exposition-laden chapters, it remains fairly well paced and interesting.\nLooking back on this book with 21st\ncentury eyes, some parts are unintentionally humorous, others are unfortunately cringeworthy. Hiro is half-black,\nhalf-Japanese and carries a pair of Japanese swords with him at all times. Cool\nwithout trying, I know, but after two de-cades, I have seen tropes like this surface\nagain and again, done worse than in this\nbook, and they leave their anachronistic\nimprint all over it. I don\u2019t know if Stephenson was treading new ground with\na character like this but now, he\u2019s a little\nembarrassing. Likewise, in the wake of\nWilliam Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer, hackers were blessed with mad tech skills.\nThese days, they are associated with the\nlike of Wikileaks and Anonymous. Y.T.\ntoo; a typical Californian skateboarder,\nher dialogue is littered with cool lingo\nand slang which has now dated horri-bly. Then again, it might be worth reprinting the book with a glossary at the\nback, similar to A Clockwork Orange.\nOn the whole, I thought this was a\nAlastair Reynolds\u2019 Pushing Ice \u2013 a modern hard SF classic\nWhile hard SF writers such as\nAsimov are some of the best known\nnames in science fiction I feel\nthat the sub-genre has been somewhat neglected of late. There are of\ncourse, several exceptions, some of\nthe most notable of which have to\nbe the works of Alastair Reynolds.\nWhile best known for his Revelation Space series I first got acquainted\nwith Reynolds through his standalone novel Pushing Ice. Set in the\n2050s, when massive corporations\nuse manned spacecraft to mine comets the novel follows the crew of one\nsuch vessel, the Rockhopper, who are\nordered away from their latest job\non an extraordinary mission. Janus,\none of Saturn\u2019s moons, has broken\nfree of its orbit, revealing itself as a\ngiant alien vessel, and the Rockhopper is the only human ship in range\nthat can intercept and examine it.\nThe novel shows the clear influence\nof Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s Rendezvous with\nRama and, though it might be a slight\nspoiler to say so, Poul Anderson\u2019s Tau\nZero. As well as similar plot elements\nthere exists in all three novels a great\nsense of the wonder of the unknown,\none of the cornerstones of good hard\nSF. A major difference, however, also\nsoon makes itself abundantly clear.\nWhile the protagonists of the two older novels were pretty much the best\npeople to face the challenges they\nencountered it soon becomes clear\nhow out of their depth the crew of the\nRockhopper really is. Combined with\nthe corporately ruled world of PushRhys Davies finally gets down to reading a dated classic of SF literature\n\u201cWhilst cool and\nedgy, it has also\ngrown rusty in the\nlast twenty years.\u201d\ning Ice, as compared with the more\nidealistic settings of the previous\ntwo novels, this leads to a great deal\nmore interpersonal conflict. While\nthis is taken too far in some places,\nwith the character Svetlana Barseghian in particular coming off probably\nfar more petty and dislikeable that\nReynolds intended, you do get a feel\nthat this is how real people would behave if placed in the extraordinarily\ndifficult situations presented here.\nAnother difference is that, unlike the other two novels, Pushing\nIce depicts direct contact between\nhumans and various different alien\nspecies. This is brilliantly realised,\ngood book (despite a weak ending). As\nwell as going for grungey sci-fi dysto-pia, Stephenson also strives for an element of intellectual rigour. It might not\nbe better than most novels but it\u2019s trying\nto be smarter and that deserves some\nrecognition. Whilst cool and edgy, it\nhas also grown rusty in the last twenty\nyears. However, as a snapshot of 1990s\nimagination, it still gleams.\nMaciej Matuszewski\n\u201cThe book shows the\ninfluence of Clarke\nand Anderson.\u201d\nwith the aliens being wonderfully\nweird \u2013 Reynolds having avoided the\nmistake of many lesser sci-fi writers\nwho make their aliens far too human,\nwhether in appearance or behaviour.\nMy only complaint on this aspect of\nthe book is that the various alien cultures encountered could have been\nexplored far more deeply. Together\nwith the somewhat open ending this\nmeans that, though one isn\u2019t strictly\nnecessary, this is one book where I\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t mind a sequel.\nPushing Ice is a brilliant read, one\nthat I literally couldn\u2019t put down, and\nI can recommend it to you all, whether\nyou are already fans of hard SF or not.\n\u201cThe novel is certainly imaginative\nwith a broad scope\nin mind.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 04 MAY 2012\n6\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nCroquet Club dormancy debated\nA Clubs and Societies Board (CSB)\nmeeting on 27 February 2012 resulted in\na decision to close the dormant Croquet\nClub along with 6 other clubs. According to Deputy President of Clubs and\nSocieties (DPCS) Monya Zard\u2019s \u201cClubs\nto Close\u201d paper, the decision was on the\ngrounds that the club had less than 20\nmembers (3 members in fact) and had\nnot completed the relevant documentation or training.\nThe Croquet Club had been made dormant on 8 December 2011 following a\nRCC (Recreational Clubs Committee)\ndormancy review, as typically happens\nto the club each year. The club\u2019s members argue that croquet is ostensibly a\nsummer sport. Furthermore the club\nleads open training every summer run by\nactive Life members such as ex-DPFS\nChristian Carter.\nCroquet Club treasurer, Eugene\nChang, claims he was not informed of\nthe potential closure prior to the meet-ing. Moreover Chang is adamant that the\nclosure is \u201cillegitmate\u201d thus seeking to\nappeal the decision preferably through\nCourt rather than the CSB. Both Chang\nand the club\u2019s chair, Joseph Rumer, who\ntendered his resignation on 29 February\n2012, denied being warned of the threat\nof closure and claimed the closure \u201cultra-vires\u201d based on a Clubs and Societies\nPolicy available online.\nIt would appear there are two key refuting claims.\nFirstly DPCS Zard did email the club\u2019s\nchair, Rumer, on 31 January 2011 clearly\nvoicing her concerns about the club and\nasking him to contact her or the RCC\nChair \u201cto discuss how to reach the targets\nyou\u2019ve been set, or how to adjust the targets so that they are achievable. Please\ntreat this as urgent.\u201d Zard went on in no\nuncertain terms, \u201ctaking no action will\nmean that your club will suffer during\nbudgeting, and could ultimately lead\u2026 to\nthe club being closed down\u201d. It\u2019s not clear\nwhether this message hit home and RCC\nChair Dominic Andradi-Brown can confirm that no monthly dormancy reports\nwere being filed as required by Clubs\nand Societies Policy. Remarkably, RCC\nChair Andradi-Brown seems to accept\nsome of the blame; \u201cI must say that I did\nnot remind them at the point they were\nmade dormant that they should be doing [the monthly reports] so some of the\nfault for not doing them is probably on\nme.\u201d Andradi-Brown discussed the club\ninformally with Rumer in early February\nreceiving the following impression \u201cHe\ndid not attempt to defend the continuing\nexistence of the club that he was Chair of\nor offer any suggestion that he would be\ngetting the club going in the summer.\u201d\nPut together, all the signs indicated\nnon-compliance with rules and no sign of\nlife; Croquet Club was no longer a functioning club and now warranted not just\ndormancy but closure. If Croquet Club\u2019s\ncommittee members were set on reactivating the club in the summer as they\nhave done in some recent years, it begs\nthe question as to why they did not comply with CSB\u2019s policy and why Rumer\ndid not respond to the concerns when\nthey were voiced. Phrases such as \u201cdysfunctional committee\u201d have been used in\nreference to the dispute.\nApparently documentation and training\nwas lacking from Croquet Club Secretary\nScott Heath. Constitutionally Scott Heath\nis not required to do so and the onlineAc-tivities System which flags up outstanding forms did not pick this up. However\nthere is no excuse for the incomplete\nFinancial Responsibility form. It is also\napparent that no one took responsibility\nto maintain the club. Other summer clubs\nmanage to comply fully with CSB\u2019s re-quirements, e.g. Cricket Club. In fact the\nActivies System show a spate of incomplete tasks across clubs and societies but\nit is not until a club fails to meet its minimum membership that the CSB takes ac-tion.\nSecondly, as to CSB\u2019s power to close\nclubs, the current version of the Clubs\nand Societies Policy available online indicates that the CSB have appropriately\nfollowed club suspension procedure.\nChang\u2019s \u201cultra-vires\u201d claim was based\non an outdated version of the Clubs and\nSocieties Policy. There may be areas for\nimprovement in the CSB\u2019s handling of\ncommunications on the matter but Zard\ngave the club reasonable opportunity to\nremedy the situation earlier on.\nIn this ongoing dispute Croquet Club\nTreasurer Chang and Secretary Scott\nHeath (also Union President) are the only\nremaining committee members following Chair Rumer\u2019s resignation. Chang is\n\u201cinterested in submitting an appeal\u201d and\nsays \u201cThe Union in my opinion, have\nbeen inconsiderate and demonstrated a\nlack of understanding of a club that has\na past history of being a summer club,\nhas reached 20 members in the last 3 academic years and has only been dormant\nfor 2 months.\u201d The result of the appeals\nprocess will not only shape the future of\nCroquet Club but also demonstrate the\ncalibre of the CSB.\nAlex Nowbar\nJohn Graham-Cumming discusses the Analytical Machine\nImperial TEDx\ntalks prove\npopular\nonline\nMatt Colvin\n\u201cChang is \u2018interested\nin submitting an appeal\u2019\u201d\nClubs and Societies Board decision leads to question of legitimacy\nTEDxImperialCollege\nVideo footage of March\u2019s TEDxImperialCollege event is now available\nto view on YouTube, with a talk by\nprogrammer John Graham-Cumming\nabout Charles Babbage\u2019s Analytical\nMachine enjoying over 18,000 views at\nthe time of going to print.\nTEDx is a program of local and\nself-organised events based upon TED\n(Technology, Entertainment and Design) conferences.

Even now, in the\nmidst of a dramatic effects era, it\u2019s\nstill an epic film to watch. But when\nCameron \u2013 forefather of 3D films\nwith his front runner Avatar \u2013 announced he was rereleasing Titanic in\n3D, there was a lot of consternation\nfrom fans who believed the masterpiece should not be tampered with. As\nanyone who has seen the film knows,\nwhile the characters and storylines\nare moving, Titanic relies greatly on\nthe spectacle itself for its brilliance \u2013\nso is that spectacle improved by 3D as\nmuch as Cameron promised?\nWell\u2026yes. Cameron and his team\nof genius film technicians spent long\nhours retrofitting the film for 3D vi-suals, as well as redoing the footage\npre-conversion \u2013 resulting in a crystal clear picture in the new version\nalmost all the way through (a few\nmoments of dated CGI slightly let\nthe side down but other than that, it\u2019s\ncracking).\nIt\u2019s probably been a while since we\nall watched the film, and what seemed\nto many a magical performance by\nall actors now seems a little tiny bit\nforced, but this can be put down to a\ndifferent style of acting. The characters are still engaging and the plotline\nstill moving, and the film presents\nan all-round beautiful experience for\nviewers. In this new 3D version, you\nmight initially be underwhelmed by\nthe effects \u2013 Brock Lovett\u2019s diamond\nsearch is still rather dull in three di-mensions, and the wreck viewing is\nalso not much more spectacular than\nin the old 2D version. Quite frankly,\nthe aged Rose was better off with\n2D. However, when the second Rose\n(Winslet) takes us back to the Titanic in Southampton, the 3D really\nkicks in with spectacular visuals of\nthe buzzing crowd, constantly building the excitement and momentousness of the occasion. The effect is\nnot overdramatic, and doesn\u2019t give\nyou a banging headache like some\nof the distinctly average 3D attempts\nof late (ahem, Alice in Wonderland)\n\u2013 like Avatar, Cameron has kept the\neffect subtle and very natural. Even\nfor us old fans of Titanic, well-known\ndinner scenes become fresh and new\nwith the 3D magic.\nUnsurprisingly, however, the effects\nreally come into their own in the second half of the film when everything\nstarts going (badly) wrong. As the\nlight character drama shifts into a disaster of epic proportions, almost every scene is improved by the 3D tech-nology. Again, even those who have\nseen the film many times will find the\ntension increased and the panic con-tagious, and the water rushing all over\nthe place is much more horrific when\nyou feel it\u2019s really going to reach your\nfeet any minute. The lifting and subsequent sinking of the stern (along\nwith Jack, Rose and the drunk man)\nis magnificently done, and the viewer\nfinds themself pulling back in their\nseat to avoid the onslaught of freezing\nwater coming right at them. The frozen oceanic graveyard is hauntingly\nreal and much more harrowing, and\nyour fury at Rose for not budging up\nand letting Jack on her piece of wood\nis probably doubled.\nOverall the conversion of Titanic to\n3D has been a success, most of which\nis clearly down to Cameron\u2019s 3D\nskills. His painstaking attention to\ndetail (every hairpin, shoe, knife and\nfork is retouched) and his use of the\nfull field makes the film convincingly\nreal, and well worth watching \u2013 even\nif you weren\u2019t all that convinced first\ntime round; it\u2019s crisp, new and feels\nlike a whole new Titanic. Although,\nunfortunately, everyone still drowns.\nThere\u2019s nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooothing I fear (except maybe that breath of yours...)\nWhat 15 years do to your face...apparently, nothing \u2013 they\u2019re just as hot It\u2019s a drought, they said...\n\n"

Because they made some pretty\nkick-ass stuff, that\u2019s why. So kick-ass in fact\nthat many modern-day game developers could\nlearn a thing or two from them. They won\u2019t,\nobviously \u2014 until reading this piece, that is.\nMaybe.\nFor the unfamiliar, Oddworld Inhabitants\nwere the creators behind the Oddworld uni-verse, the backdrop for their game series, the\nOddworld Quintology, a planned pentalogy\nthat ended up a tetralogy. Though the series\ndidn\u2019t extend as far as they had planned the\nuniverse they had created by the time they\nthrew in the towel was already packed with a\nmultitude of playable and non-playable races.\nIn the first game alone you\u2019re introduced to\nMudokons, Glukkons, Sligs, Slogs, Scrabs and\nParamites.\nMore importantly they\u2019re not just thrown\ntogether in a clumsy, failed attempt to create\n\u2018richness\u2019 or \u2018variety\u2019. The races of Oddworld\nare woven together in a credible backstory that\nwould fill more pages than my editor would\nallow for, but in essence revolves around a\ndystopian society created by the industrial\nGlukkons, who are in the process of enslav-ing, exploiting or eating every other species on\nthe planet. There is of course more to it than\nthat, and as the series progresses more races\nand challenges appear, as does more story to\nblend it all together.\nThe first two games of the series, Oddworld:\nAbe\u2019s Oddysee and Oddworld: Abe\u2019s Exoddus, are arguably the two games that defined\nthe Oddworld series, and in part the PlayStation era; Abe\u2019s Oddysee was one of the games\nAxon\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/592325\nSo you\u2019re not into biochemistry? How about archae-ology? More specifically, DINOSAURS.\nBeing a newly-hatched dinosaur is (or was) pretty\ntough, and no-one likes the hassle of fighting off\nalien invaders seconds after hatching. And yet, this\nis what you are tasked with doing, be it with mini-guns, rocket launchers, or a whole host of other\nweapons that probably didn\u2019t exist in the Late Cretaceous period. Deal enough damage and you can\nDigimon-style evolve into a laser-spewing T-Rex for a\nfew seconds. Take THAT Darwin.\nThis game is crazy insane, crazy fun, and certainly\ngood enough to hold off revision for a little longer.\nAs a biochemist who\u2019s taken a course in neuroscience (never mind that I probably failed it) a game\ntitled Axon naturally grabs my attention. Would I be\ntreated to an educational game detailing the physiological properties of a neuron? Thankfully not.\nAxon is instead a simple, addictive game in which\nyou \u2018grow\u2019 a neuron by connecting it up to balls of\nprotein, steadily increasing its length. Beyond facing off invading neurons that wrestle for available\nspace you\u2019re also on a time limit, and waiting too\nlong before making a new connection kills off your\nbudding neuron. Snag four gold proteins in a row\nand your amacrine cell just became a trunk dorsal\nroot sensory neuron!

Game\nelements were rendered with 3D modelling\nsystems, with the backgrounds being hand-painted, a feature that has helped the games\nremain attractive even whilst game graphics\nimproved around it.\nAs I\u2019ve said many times in the past, graphics\ndo not make a game. They help it for sure, but\nas Transformers: Dark of the Moon showed\nus great effects can\u2019t make up for shoddy plot\n(sorry Mike), just like shiny graphics can\u2019t\ncover shoddy control systems or easy \u2018challenges\u2019. In some ways Oddworld Inhabitants\novercompensated \u2014 both games are mindbogglingly hard to complete, let alone complete to 100%. The protagonist of both titles,\nAbe, is tasked with saving his fellow people,\nthe Mudokons, from Glukkon extortion, first\nfrom the delightfully named meat factory Rupture Farms and then from the bottling plant\nSoulstorm Brew. Along the way he\u2019s harassed\nby guards, assaulted by meat packing machinery and a whole host of other dangers that are\nall one-shot kills.\nTiming and accuracy are both key; miss a\njump by a even fraction and you\u2019re gone. Duck\na second too late and you\u2019re squashed. Secret\nrooms are rampant: in both games there\u2019s one\nin the very first screen, and there even are secret rooms WITHIN secret rooms. Oddysee\nand Exoddus come from an era when challenges were incredibly difficult, and going back\nto them years on makes for a very refreshing\nchange of pace.\nBoth games are available on the PC via\nSteam, or there are always some discs floating\nabout on Amazon. Pick up copies if you can!\n(Or, at least, after your exams are over.)\n\u201cTiming and accuracy\nare both key; miss a\njump by even a fraction\nand you\u2019re gone. Duck\na second too late and\nyou\u2019re squashed.\u201d\nUnlike most other games from the Playstation era Oddworld: Abe\u2019s Exoddus, released\nin 1998, still holds up to this day, both graphically and gameplay-wise\nAbe\u2019s nickname of \u2018Stitch Lips\u2019 is not entirely unjustified\n\n"

The film, based on\na novel by Deborah Moggach, follows a\ngroup of British retirees including Judi\nDench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith and\nmany more British talents, in search of\na place to outsource their retirement.\nEach of them look no further than a\nglistening advertisement for a retiree\nresort entitled \u2018The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\u2019, in Jaipur, India, for the \u2018elderly and beautiful.\u2019 However, upon ar-rival, the retirees soon realise that the\nhotel is not quite how it was portrayed\non the advert, but rather an old dusty\nbuilding with major renovation work\nneeded.\nEvelyn (Dench), around which most\nof the plot circulates, is a housewife\nturned widow who discovers that her\nlate husband\u2019s debts had run up so\nmuch that she had to sell her house.\nHer decision to travel to India marks\nher newfound independence and letting\ngo from her much doted upon husband.\nMadge (Imrie) is an aged single girl\nwho\u2019s on the hunt for a rich husband,\nand Norman (Pickup), also single and\nready to mingle, wants a girlfriend, or\nanything he can get, even if it\u2019s just\n\u2018one night of passion.\u2019 Douglas (Nighy)\nand Jean (Wilton) are a couple that\nhave lost most of their retirement fund\ninvested into their daughters failed\ninternet-company. They decide to get\naway to India for a break from their\ndaily routine.\nThe film wonderfully portrays the\nold British fascination for India, particularly during its colonial days, when\nGraham (Wilkinson), a high court magistrate who grew up there, tries to seek\nout people, memories and familiarities\nfrom his past there. Maggie Smith\u2019s\nperformance as Muriel provides endless chuckles, owing to her xenophobic\nviews. Her only reason for travelling to\nIndia is for a hip operation.\nIf you watch this movie in a cinema,\nyou\u2019ll notice two things: most of the\npeople there are over the age of fifty,\nand the movie theatre is filled with\nlaughter at the culture shock that develops when the retirees arrive in India.\nThe different hygiene standards, food,\ncultural customs, religious beliefs and\ncaste system all surprise the retirees\nin some way, with an amusing scene\nshowing all the retirees rushing to the\ntoilet after having their first meal at\ntheir Jaipur resort.\nThis film shows the colours and richness of Indian culture and the warmth\nof its people. It portrays a touching\nmessage to the audience, where life is\nseen as a gift, and not a right. This is\nreflected in the warmth of Patel\u2019s frantic character. Although his beloved\nhotel is a shambles, his never-ending\nquest to please his guests and improve\nhis hotel is endearing. Patel\u2019s performance as a young troubled man trying\nto restore his deceased father\u2019s hotel to\nits former glory is convincing, and his\nacting skillset has much progressed,\nalong with his faux Indian accent, since\nhis performance in Danny Boyle\u2019s Oscar winning Slumdog Millionaire.\nAlthough the film is very comedic\nin nature, the touching messages carried throughout, along with side plots\ninvolving love dilemmas, make for a\nfilm that will keep you on your toes.\nAll in all, this movie, brimming with\noutstanding performances owing to its\ntalented cast, is an uplifting tale of a\ngroup of people that discover a different culture and develop a new outlook\non life. Through shared experiences,\nthey make friends and some find love\nalong the way by letting go of their\npast.\nLucia Podhorska\nDirector Drew Goddard\nScreenwriters Joss Whedon, Drew\nGoddard\nCast Kristen Connolly, Chris\nHemsworth, Jesse William, Fran\nKranz, Anna Hutchison\nThe Cabin in the Woods\nUsually, I am not a fan of horror mov-ies, but knowing that this was written\nby Joss Whedon \u2013 the genius behind\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer \u2013 was enough\nto make me risk potential nightmares\nand watch it. And I\u2019m glad I did \u2013 even\nthough I haven\u2019t really been able to\nsleep since.\nTogether with Drew Goddard,\nWhedon has brought audiences a retelling of a classic horror story, with numerous modern and humorous twists.\nFor those unfamiliar with the tale \u2013 a\ngroup of people (generally teenagers or\nridiculously hot young adults) go to a\ndeserted cabin in the woods for a weekend getaway, but not everyone manages\nto come back home as they are soon\nkilled off by some crazy woodfolk. I\ncan\u2019t really give away much more of\nthe plot, as the best thing about this\nmovie is not quite knowing what exactly you\u2019re getting yourself into.\nShot back in 2009, the release date\nof the movie was pushed back indefinitely due to financial difficulties at\nMGM Studios. Being aware of the fate\nof many of Whedon\u2019s projects, I had\npretty much given up hope that this\nwould ever make it to cinemas, and so\nwas pleasantly surprised when the promotional posters first appeared. The\nsuccess \u2013 both critical and commercial\n\u2013 of the film is, in my opinion, not that\nsurprising, as Joss Whedon doesn\u2019t do\nanything by halves and audiences can\nonce again expect a viewing experience\nthat is equal parts original, intelligent,\nsatirical and comical. The laugh-out-loud moments were my favourite part\nof the movie, as they gave the whole\nthing a very surreal feel while also allowing me to calm down after a jump-out-of-my-seat scene.\nI might be exaggerating the overall\nscariness of the movie (please bear in\nmind that I\u2019m a bit of a wimp), so don\u2019t\nlet that put you off watching this. It\nis definitely nowhere near as scary as\nThe Woman in Black, for example. The\ncharacters are genuinely entertaining\n\u2013 especially Marty (Kranz from Dollhouse) \u2013 and you\u2019re kept guessing until\nthe very end of the movie as to what is\nreally going on. Goddard, who has previously worked with Whedon on Buffy\nand J.J. Abrams on Lost, makes his directorial debut and does a fine job.\nDescribed by Whedon as a \u2018critique\nof what we love and hate about horror movies,\u2019 the film manages to have\ncopious amounts of blood and gore\nwithout making viewers uncomfort-able. The ending felt a bit rushed, but it\nwas still completely unexpected. Fans\nof Whedon\u2019s previous works will be\npleased with this offering, whilst \u2013 I\nhope \u2013 newcomers will also appreciate his oftentimes undervalued talent as a storyteller. The Cabin in the\nWoods might not be for everyone, but\nI for one thought it was good fun and\nrecommend it if you enjoy movies that\nare unafraid to take risks and that are\nnot at all how they appear to be at first\nglance.\nMust find Bond, must find Bond, must find Bond, must find Bond...\nYep, she\u2019s definitely in Team Jacob\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 04 may 2012\n14\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nI\nwould like to start off by saying\nfrom the bottom of my heart that\nthis note is not designed to of-fend. I was urged to write this for\nmy own peace of mind and also\nfor those who put their hearts and souls\ninto supporting me. I hope to clarify\nsome events of the election, which may\nnot have come to light. Lastly, I would\nalso like to state that I would have released a similar article had the outcome\nof the election been different.\nAs you probably know, I ran for\nUnion President during March. One\nof the primary reasons for me running\nwas that I was fed up with the way the\nCollege and departments were treating\nsome of the students, with low reported\nstudent satisfaction affecting the university\u2019s position in the national league\ntables. I also opposed the neglect some\nstudents were receiving, such as the\nabsurdly small grants \u2013 compared to\nother societies in the Union \u2013 given to\nthe OSC, which supports International\nstudents. I believed I could have made a\ntangible change.\nWhat should have been an enjoyable campaign soon turned sour due to\nthe amount of negative campaigning I\nfaced during those weeks. One of my\nopposition\u2019s campaign team actively\nwent around spreading false rumours\nabout me such as: I was suspended from\nmy posts and banned from lectures,\namongst others. Furthermore, they accused me of being a racist and sexist,\ndespite my blunt demeanour this is a\ncompletely false accusation and extremely offensive. I appreciate that the\nopposing candidate had limited control over what his campaign team were\nspreading, but questions must be asked,\nwhen he allegedly said to a few of his\nfriends \u2018I am going to find out all the\ndirt I can about Abdul\u2019 before the elections had even started. Members of\nmy own campaign team asked me if I\nwanted to retaliate by doing the same,\nto which I replied with \u2018no don\u2019t bother,\nif I lose, at least I lost with integrity\u2019. I\nstick by those words.\nThis brings me onto my next point.\nMany of you may have read the blog\ntitled \u2018why you shouldn\u2019t vote for Abdul\u2019. Whereas I believe the author is entitled to their beliefs and opinion, what\ncame later in the anonymous comment\nsection was horrifying. The majority\nof the comments on that article were\nfallacious and with malicious intent;\nsomeone went as far as accusing me of\nhaving a criminal record and another of\nbringing the college to disrepute during my time in Texas (which in fact\ngoes against the praise I received from\nthe International Office for my work\nthere). At the time I did not know how\nto respond to this form of sabotage and,\nmaybe to my detriment, I felt it didn\u2019t\nwarrant a response so decided to concentrate on my own positive campaign.\nAnother topic that has perplexed\nmany people is the negative campaigning through the use of Twitter, most\nnotably, from ex-ICU president Alex\nKendall. During the live \u2018Meet the Candidates\u2019show on the elections webpage,\nlive tweets were displayed on the side\nfor all to see. During which, Kendall\naccused me of being disciplined by the\ncollege. This unfounded lie was in due\ncourse dealt with by the Union and as\nsuch Kendall had to issue an apology\ntweet under the instruction of the returning officer, Michael Foster. However, the apology tweet acknowledging\nthat what he said wasn\u2019t true only came\na couple of days after the initial one so\nthe damage was already done and, due\nto the high profile of the author, the\noriginal tweet had a significant detrimental impact. Regardless, during the\nfollowing week he dedicated the bulk\nof his tweets on the \u2018#voteicu\u2019 twitter\npage to attacking me. He refers to me as\na \u2018homophobic bully\u2019 and reminds people not to vote for me, seldom giving an\nexplanation as to why any of the other\ncandidates would be more suitable.\nMany people may wonder what created\nthis hatred he has towards me. Last year\nduring the summer elections, a friend of\nmine (who asked not to be named) was\nsubjected to harassment from Kendall\nand he went as far as calling that person\nMy view on the elections\n\u2018bloody pathetic\u2019 amongst other things\nin emails (proof can be supplied on re-quest). It got so bad that he reduced this\nperson to tears after a Union court case.\nSeeing this I confronted him about his\nactions. In response, he filed two complaints against me to the college tutors for homophobia and intimidation,\nbased on what other people put on my\nFacebook page. After realising that the\nevidence was weak and he was over-reacting, the college tutors dismissed\nhis accusations.\nI did, on multiple occasions, appeal\nto the election committee and the returning officer about these unsavoury\ntactics and if anything could be done\nto prevent members of the opposition\u2019s campaign team from spreading\nthese libellous and malicious rumours.\nAlmost all of my appeals were readily\ndismissed and the impression I got was\nthat there was a huge bias against me. It\nwas as if the selection had already been\nmade on who was to become the new\nPresident before the election had even\nstarted. When having the audacity to\nattempt something different by parading through campus with a megaphone\n(which is a common occurrence in other\nuniversities during campaign week) I\nwas issued with a fine and threatened\nwith, amongst other things, disqualifi-cation. Dealing with these complaints is\none of the reasons why the Presidential\nresults took so long to be released.\nSome of you may ask me why I bothered to write this article and what I hope\nto achieve. I am not expecting any further action to be taken and my time in\nthe Union is almost over. All I ask for\nis the truth to be released and to make\nstudents aware of it. The Union boasts\nabout its diverse and democratic nature\nbut in my personal opinion, after the\nrecent treatment I was subjected to, I\nwould argue otherwise.\nAre you boss?\nWell then,\nhead on over\nto: felixon-line.co.uk to\nget your voice\nheard.\nAbdul Patel\nSo somebody\u2019s been elected London\nMayor, apparently. When it comes down\nto those gosh darn Thursday elections,\nFelix finds itself in the unenviable position of not being able to report on who\nwon. Anyway, as tempting as it might\nhave been for Felix to run an incredibly\nlocalised and ultimately wildly inaccurate exit poll, we didn\u2019t particularly\nwish to tempt fate. What is fact, howev-er, is the potential clout that students\nhad in the vote. With nearly 450,000\nLondon-based students eligible to list\ntheir preferences for Mayor of London\nand members of the London Assembly,\na real difference could have been made\nto the results if all were to stand up\nand be counted. Of course, this wasn\u2019t\nentirely the case.\nThe ability for students to be able to\nvote for Mayor of London is something\nthat should be seized with both hands.\nThe manifesto points of the candidates\nhave a real difference in the day-to-day lives of Londoners. Yet, there are\ninevitably those who didn\u2019t go to the\npolling booth. One prevalent excuse\nfrom those I\u2019ve discussed the election\nwith was that they simply \u201ccouldn\u2019t be\nbothered\u201d. Is this really acceptable?\nIt\u2019s one thing to vote for a candidate\nfor a reason, but not being aware when\nthe decision makes a real difference\nto life in London? That\u2019s another thing\nentirely.\nThere\u2019s also the issue that the contest has been veering towards a war\nof words and personality, much to its\ndetriment. From the usual Boris gaffes\nto the much debated Ken tax affair\nthere has been distressingly few proper discussions and debate between\ncandidates that didn\u2019t descend into\nmud slinging. Even the live debates\nhave been little more than candidates\nattacking other candidates. It\u2019s little\nwonder that while there are those who\nfervently oppose candidates, there are\nthose who simply can\u2019t make head nor\ntail of the situation. And this isn\u2019t a\nsituation that we should be in.\nAn issue connected to this election\nand one that divides Londoners to the\nsame degree are the upcoming Olympic Games. For those who despair at\nthe bill, there are those who fervently\nbelieve in the resulting legacy. Then\nthere are those who don\u2019t particularly\nmind that much at all. They should be\ncaring about this and the Mayor of London. Beyond the rhetoric and campaign\ntrail, there are real changes that will be\naffecting the city we work, study and\nlive in.\nTo vote or not to vote:\nwhat\u2019s the problem?\nRON came last after a strong campaign for President. He has Hermione, so doesn\u2019t care\n\n"

There\u2019s no better way to\nmeet new people before the festival, or unwind\nfor a few days after the partying, than kicking\nback on the beach with a jug of sangria and ridiculous sun hat. It\u2019s also possible to squeeze in\na lot of beach time throughout the festival, as the\nmusic doesn\u2019t even start until the sun sets, allowing you to recover from the night before and\nkick-start yourself for the evening\u2019s affairs.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the music.

Being a creature\nof the night I often find it hard to get my body\nmoving before lunchtime, making the evening-centred music just perfect.\nThe town itself is also absolutely lovely, and\nsurprisingly affordable if you\u2019re willing to hop\naway from the main streets into the smaller side\nstreets, where you\u2019ll easily find paella and sangria at about half the price and double the qual-ity. Having such great restaurants and countless\nhip bars at your disposal makes the festival\ncamping experience a lot more enjoyable. Being quaint and small, the contents of Benicassim\nare also in such close proximity that any form of\nnavigation is pretty much idiot proof.\nWhile some festival-goers opt to travel over to\nthe festival with the beloved folk at RyanJet, an\nincreasing number are starting to turn the journey into a bit of a road trip. Providing you have\nthe time, this is certainly a great way to do it.\nAfter all, Benicassim is just a short drive from\nthe charming old city of Valencia. In addition\nto more great beaches, restaurants and bars, the\ncity has countless interesting things to check\nout. Beyond its incredible exterior, the City of\nArts and Science offers a slightly different angle\non the topics covered at the institutions around\nSouth Ken, and neighbourhoods like the Barri\ndel Carme manage to capture so well the iconic\n\u201ceclectic beats, fantastic\neateries and sunshiny\ndays\u201d\nSummer festival ambitions\nWhy Benicassim should be the top of your list for 2012\nSweaty, sun-singed and fired up on sangria: maybe you should reconsider those summer internship plans\nStunning skylines from Parliament Hill\nTravel on your doorstep\n\u2018Milking it in Delhi\u2019 by Prakash Singh\nBenicassim 2012 is taking place from the\n12th to the 15th of July, and features over\n100 acts across 3 stages.

A major\nrisk factor for the disease is infection\nwith a parasitic liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. The cancer is invariably\nfatal.\nJohn spoke about how this cancer is\noften detected too late due to a lack of\naccurate diagnostic biomarkers. His\nproject, which he worked on for three\nmonths, aimed to explore whether\nmetabolic differences between urine\nsamples of healthy controls and cancer\npatients could provide the basis for a\nnovel detection method.\nIndeed, he found that healthy controls\nand cancer patients had distinct urinary\nmetabolic profiles with significant differences between levels of citrate, hip-purate and glycine.\nJohn said, \u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased to\nwin the first Institute of Global Health\nInnovation student challenges competi-tion, particularly as I had to rush back\nfrom playing hockey at Varsity to compete for the prize. It was very exciting to\npresent my project to such high-profile\njudges, and such an award validates the\nemerging role global health is playing\nin international research.\u201d\nHe plans to use the \u00a32000 to further\nvalidate the findings in a larger study.\nAnother goal is to create a urine dip-At the end of last term, the Institute of\nGlobal Health Innovation (IGHI) held\nthe final of a new competition in which\nfive students presented a global health\nproject with which they were involved,\ncompeting for a prize of \u00a32000 to put\ntowards their project.\nThe students had ten minutes each\nto impress three judges, former Chief\nMedical Officer and Chair in Health\nPolicy at the IGHI, Sir Liam Donaldson, a BBC health correspondent, Jane\nDreaper, and founder and president\nof the charity, PiggyBankKids, Sarah\nBrown.\nThe competition was open to students\nstudying for a BSc, MSc, MEng, MBA,\nMPH or MRes with final year projects\nbeing the basis for their entries.\nThe winner was John Chetwood, a\nfifth year medical student, who undertook work on cholangiocarcinoma\n(CCA), or bile duct cancer, in Thailand\nfor his BSc in Gastroenterology and\nstick which can detect the presence of\nthe cancer early and accurately. He said,\n\u201cSuch as cheap and easy method has the\npotential to save many lives.\u201d\nAlso highly commended was another\nmedical student, Yu-Jeat Chong, for his\nproject which used satellite technology\nto monitor salinity in drinking water.\nThe Institute hopes the competition\nwill become an annual event and entries\ncan already be submitted for next year.\nThe final was followed by the IGHI\u2019s\nannual lecture given by Sir Liam Donaldson on \u201cPolio: The challenge of\nmaking it history\u201d. Sir Liam is currently\nthe Chair of the International Monitoring Board (IMB) on polio eradication.\nSince the goal of polio eradication\nwas declared by the WHO in 1988,\nthe number of cases has been reduced\nby 99%. However, the remaining 1%\nremains elusive and there is concern\nthat polio will not be eradicated before\nfunding dries up.\nStudents compete for global\nhealth project prize\nRector Sir Keith O\u2019Nions spoke at the launch of the Institute of Global Health Innovation\nNEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 04 may 2012\n4\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nSophia David\n\u201cThe incidence of\nCCA is increasing\nworldwide\u201d\n\u201cSuch a cheap and\neasy method has\nthe potential to save\nmany lives \u201d\nImperial College is to have a Provost.\nWhere once there was a Rector there\nwill be two positions, a \u201cPresident &\nRector\u201d and a \u201cProvost of the College\u201d.\nWhat is a Provost, one wonders. By\ndefinition, a provost is the head of a col-lege. What, then, is a rector?\nFollowing a decision by Imperial\u2019s\nCouncil, the governing body of the\nCollege, Imperial\u2019s leadership arrangements are set to change. The distinction\nbetween the two new roles is clear; the\nPresident & Rector will oversee all functions with particular emphasis on external matters both in the UK and overseas\nincluding alumni and industry while the\nProvost will focus more on academic\naffairs. The Provost will report to the\nPresident & Rector. Chair of Imperial\u2019s\nCouncil Baroness Manningham-Buller\nbelieves the change will \u201callow Imperial to maintain its position as one of the\nworld\u2019s top universities\u201d in the face of\n\u201ctough challenges\u201d to higher education.\nThe challenges Baroness Manningham-Buller refers to are reduced state\nfunding for UK universities and competition between universities for the best\nstudents and staff. Splitting the role of\nRector enables the President & Rector\nto focus on building relationships with\nalumni, governments, industry and\nsupporter, promote Imperial and raise\nfunds, and the Provost on Imperial\u2019s\nfundamental academic mission - educa-tion, research and translation.\nOn Monday 30 April 2012, Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions assumed the position of President & Rector while a search for the\nfirst Provost was launched. However,\nSir Keith is due to retire at the end of\n2013. Therefore, in addition to the current search for Provost, a search for a\nPresident & Rector to succeed Sir Keith\nwill commence at the end of May 2012.\nThus the new leadership arrangement\nwill not be fully in place until the end\nof 2013.\nThe new leadership model is not as\nalien as it might sound. Indeed, it is\nwell-established in many American universities including Harvard, Princeton\nand Stanford universities to name but a\nfew. Sir Keith said of his new role, \u201cThe\nPresident & Rector, as the College\u2019s\nleader, will promote Imperial\u2019s position\nas a global university, moving it into a\ndifferent league in terms of development potential, and influence of higher\neducation and research policy. The Provost will ensure the standard and quality\nof the academic programme is maintained and enhanced.\u201d\n\u201cThe new leadership\nmodel is not as alien\nas it might sound\u201d\nAlex Nowbar\nPresident and Provost\nroles introduced\nImperial follows in the footsteps of universities such as Harvard\n\n"

It\u2019s hard to categorise his\nmusic; he describes it as \u201cR&B concrete\u201d. His DJ sets are well known\nfor their incredible eclecticism, and\nI\u2019m sure he will refuse to pander to the\ndance floor live. And he used to play\nfor West Brom - a true character. I am\npositive Bloc.\u2019s new industrial loca-tion, combined with a minimal lighting\nset up, will establish a fantastic mood\nfor Actress, in a rare live appearance.\nPersonally I pray he\u2019s on Stubnitz. \u2013 R\nCeephax Acid Waltzers\nHeaded by practically-Bloc.-resident\nCeephax Acid Crew, brother of the\nincredible Squarepusher, this stage,\ndebuting at Bloc. 2012, promises to be\nquite the spectacle. With legends such\nas Nathan Fake doing a speed garage\nset on a stage that appears to be, quite\nliterally, waltzers, this is the kind of\nfull on nonsense that you won\u2019t witness\nanywhere else. Featuring (amongst a\nhost of others) Mark Archer, half of\nthe legendary rave duo Altern8, this\nbrand of insanity exactly what defines\nBLOC, and you\u2019d be a madman to\nmiss it. You\u2019ll probably also have to be\na madman to be there. \u2013 R\nW\nith a new location,\nbigger names, and\na wider line-up\nthan ever, Bloc.\n2012 looks to be\na must-see for any electronic music\nlover. Covering big dubstep drops\n(Kode9, Loefah), alternative hip-hop\n(Doom) and pioneering minimal composers (Steve Reich), the range at this\nyear\u2019s London based event will satiate\nalmost all discerning tastes. Previously\nhosted at Butlins, Minehead, Bloc. has\ndecided to become \u201cbigger and better\u201d,\nmoving to the abandoned industrial-looking complex somewhat ironically\n(in this day and age - it used to be a\nhaunt of London socialites) named\nLondon Pleasure Gardens and pushing\nharder than ever for an eclectic line up.\nBelow are some of our picks for the\nbest of Bloc., and we even have a competition to win two tickets!\nOrbital\nRenowned for their massive live\nshows, Orbital have been captivating\nrave and festival audiences since their\nlauded debut Orbital in 1991. Their\nnew album, Wonky seamlessly blends\nin their old-school summer anthem\nstyle with the biggest sounds from UK\nbass over the past 2 \u2013 3 years. DJs will\nbe dropping these tunes all over the\nshop this festival season, so why not\nget one step ahead of the game and see\nthem live? Orbital\u2019s energetic perfor-mance, complete with that all-so-rare\nelectronic improvisation, could well\nend up being a highlight of the festi-val. \u2013 R\nActress\nLondon resident Darren Cunningham\nDJs lo-fi, hazy house beats for dark\nrooms of youtube generation, messy\nravers on a regular basis. I have experienced such sets and, they are utterly\nphenomenal. His new album, R.I.P,\npushes further towards weird ambient\nRaster-Noton\nRaster-Noton are a one of a kind imprint\ntaking the intersection of sonic and visual art with no salt. In a sort of hive\nmind nature, its roster counts a number\nof artists combining the two formats in\na single unifying aesthetic of black &\nwhite clicks & cuts. Unlike other A/V\ncontemporaries, the aim of R-N has always been to tie the two seamlessly, so\nthat every sound piercing through the\nspeakers is also manifested directly on\nthe screen. The subtle shifts in a beat\nillustrated as a wall of scattering dots,\ngeometric shapes bending to the rumble\nof the frequencies. This label has taken\naudiovisual interpretation to an acme.\nThe correlation between the sounds and\nthe picture is uncanny, giving the listener a closer insight into the intricacies\nof the glitchy dance music emanating\nfrom the bass bins. Aesthetically, one\nmight imagine a conversation between\na vending machine and a type writer, in\ntheir own electromechanical language.\nMind you, this is the future. \u2013 I\nNicolas Jaar\nIt\u2019s now over a year since Nicolas\nJaar released Space is Only Noise \u2013\nthe album that made techno-heads,\njazz fiends and generally anyone else\nwho\u2019s a bit pretentious declare it their\nnew favourite record. It was, indeed, a\nvery good record. Since then he\u2019s continued along the same path; delicate\npiano and guitar melodies float over\nbrooding, melancholy synths. Soulful\nvocals are looped upon a backdrop of\nminimal percussion treated with dollops of reverb. The result is music that\nwinds you into a trance, while the understated bass lines ensure it doesn\u2019t\nlose its way. Nicolas Jaar will be quite\na contrast against the likes of Carl\nCraig and Ricardo Villalobos, but\nhell, when you\u2019re at a 16 hour party,\nmelting into a half hour trance might\nbe just what is needed. - S\nStubnitz\nThis world-renowned arts institution\n(pictured bottom left) has been touring Europe since it was converted\nfrom a freeze & transport vessel in\n1993, but this is its first ever London\nappearance. Presenting the whole\nspectrum from theatre to art to mu-sic, its presence at Bloc. is truly\nsomething to look forward to. If for\nnothing else, take a peek online at\nthe inside of the ship \u2013 I\u2019m not sure\nI can think of any cooler environment for some of the world\u2019s most\ncutting edge electronic artists. Previous performers have included the\nphenomenal Chris Forsyth, who we\nreviewed in autumn term, and Bristol\nlegends Bronnt Industries Kapital.\nThis relatively small (despite its massive outside size) stage could really\nbring something new and special to\nthe Bloc. environment. It\u2019s not every\nday you get to hit a boat party (well,\noutside of Croatia). - R\nArpanet\nIn what is possibly this millennium\u2019s\nmost impressive booking, Bloc. have\nmanaged to secure the performance\nof one of Detroit\u2019s most reclusive and\nsecretive acts. Arpanet is believed to\nbe lead by, or possibly solely, Gerald\nDonald, also of the pioneering Drexciya and Dopplereffekt.\nThis one should really appeal to all\nus Imperial nerds (my apologies for\nthe stereotyping).

    "content": "God, redemption, religion, the forces of\ngood and evil. It is hard to tackle these none\ntoo light topics in a manner which doesn\u2019t\nbecome cumbersome. Peter Cadwell did it\nin The Fighter\u2019s Ballad, but confronts the\nbull head-on \u2013 the film is no laughing mat-ter. Enda Walsh\u2019s Misterman deals with\nsimilar ideas of Right and Wrong, albeit\ncouched in the very Irish and Catholic setting of Innisfree \u2013 a small isle lagooned in\nthe Emerald Isle.\nWhether or not one could call Misterman\na comedy is difficult to say. Cillian Murphy\u2019s slapstick careering about the stage in\nveritable circus style, hurling props, scrambling eggs and spraying the stage with his\nsaliva lend Walsh\u2019s production a humour\nwhich is distinct contrast to the play\u2019s grave\nmessages and violent ending.\nMurphy is the only actor but this is easily forgotten amid the colossal set \u2013 which\nextends some twenty metres from the audience \u2013 the jumble of paraphernalia that populates Holy Fool Thomas Magill\u2019s decrepit\nwarehouse dwelling, feats of lighting that\nwould put New Year\u2019s Eve to shame, sound\ndesign on a huge and innovative scale and\nMurphy\u2019s stellar rendering of Thomas and\nthe ten-odd other inhabitants of Innisfree he\nmeets as he pops out to the shops to pick his\nMammy up some Jammy Dodgers.\nWalsh has created an experience as well\nas a play. The imagination is allowed to run\nwild \u2013 A= myriad of gaps is left for us to fill\nin. Aesthetically it is glorious.\nThe play\u2019s premise and flow I found to be\npatchy and at times unfathomable. And it\u2019s\ndeeper and more religious passages were\na bit too tedious for this lapsed Catholic.\nBut Walsh\u2019s script had moments of rapid\nwit and jocularity that were brought to life\nwonderfully by Murphy, who gives a startling high-octane level of performance for\nthe complete ninety minutes.\nOne wonders whether Walsh has been\ninspired and influenced by Philip Ridley\u2019s\nearlier plays. Misterman, written in 1999,\nis a surreal and messy depiction of reality\nwhere the sublime is twisted up with the\nviolent and a young person lives in squalor and his own inner world. Jamie Vartan\u2019s\nepic set design certainly recalls those used\nin recent productions of Ridley\u2019s plays\nMercury Fur and The Pitchfork Disney. But\nthe light of heart and stomach need fear not:\nMisterman is most definitely not a Ridley\nplay.\nMisterman runs until 28 May at the National Theatre (Lyttleton).

    "content": "FILM\nFELIX Friday 04 MAY 2012 27\nAssemble for Avengers Assemble\nJohn Park\nDirector Joss Whedon\nScreenwriters Zak Penn, Joss\nWhedon, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby\nCast Robert Downey Jr., Chris\nHemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett\nJohansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy\nRenner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom\nHiddleston\nAvengers Assemble\nWhether you like it or not, The Avengers have been assembled, and the lineup is unbelievably impressive; there\nare six pumped up heroes, an intense\ndirector of a top-secret organisation\nwho brings them together, and a villain\ncommanding an army out to annihilate\nEarth. There, that\u2019s the general gist of\nthe plot; the kind of formula many superhero films put to use. But Avengers\nAssemble (an unfortunate last-minute\ntitle change here in the U.K.) is a lot\nmore than that. Joss Whedon\u2019s mass en-semble, 200 million-dollar rollercoaster ride makes the two-and-a-half-hour\nlong running time worth every minute,\nas Whedon pays as much attention to\nhis many characters and humour as\nhe does to delivering the high-budget\nspectacle.\nIt takes a while to actually get everyone in the same room. And even after\nthat Nick Fury\u2019s (Jackson) job isn\u2019t\nquite complete. With big egos and personality differences, characters clash,\nand as Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) correctly points out, they\u2019re not a team, but\ninstead a time bomb, a term Dr. Banner\nhimself is all too familiar with, since he\nturns into a giant raging green monster\nif he fails to control his anger. Captain\nAmerica (Evans), a former WWII soldier transported and adjusting to the\n21st Century (long story, watch his film\nreleased last year for details), works\nthrough his nightmares by taking out\nhis frustration at the hopelessly vulnerable punching bags he has lined up.\nHe too, cannot be said to have a sound\nmind.\nThe fact that it\u2019s Loki (Hiddleston),\nThor\u2019s (Hemsworth) brother, who is\nout for Earth\u2019s destruction arouses\nsome conflicted feelings. Thor wants to\nreach out to his brother with sentiment,\nwhereas a certain arrogant yet brilliantly intelligent and self-proclaimed\nbillionaire philanthropist has a problem\nwith that approach. Of course, Tony\nStark (Downey Jr.), the Iron Man, is not\nsomeone who plays well with others.\nOh, and that Stark doesn\u2019t respond well\nto orders? Captain America, always the\ndutiful soldier, might have a problem\nwith that too. The confrontations these\ncharacters often get into show that, despite their extraordinary powers, deep\ndown they are flawed creatures like\nthe rest of us; Whedon, although not so\nheavy-handedly, shows the weaknesses\nthey share, furthering exploring everyone\u2019s unique identity.\nSo the superhuman heroes are struggling to be merry. But what about the\ntwo agents already a part of the Furydirected S.H.I.E.L.D? They are Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Jo-hansson), a deadly spy/assassin, and\nClint Barton, aka Hawkeye (Renner),\nan expert archer. Barton gets into a little\ntrouble of his own in the killer opening\nscene directed with flash and necessary\npace by Whedon, who knows how to\nstart off the most anticipated film of the\nyear. Thanks to Loki, a whole base is\nwiped out in the first ten minutes of the\nfilm, and from this point on, we know\nthat a) Samuel L. Jackson is pissed off,\nand b) Whedon means business: a combination that produces something truly\nwonderful.\nWhen the heroes can\u2019t quite play\nalong, Whedon rightly hits the pause\nbutton on the action, whilst using every\nchange he gets to slip in a line or two\ngenerating quality laughs. This way he\ngives the film a much-needed breather,\nwhilst also building his characters even\nmore. A lot of credit must go to Downey\nJr., who has owned the role of Iron Man\never since his first outing, and the jokes\nhe delivers are pure comedy gold. The\nunexpected surprise here however, is\nRuffalo, who in his first ever portrayal\nof Dr. Banner comes out as the real\nwinner both in terms of his contribution\nto the team as well as his several scene-stealing moments. Both Eric Bana and\nEdward Norton have tried in the past\nto bring out their own versions of The\nHulk, but Ruffalo, comically timid and\nnerdy before he turns green, is who truly embodies the role, and he deserves\na feature film of his own in the future.\nAs tension escalates and the fate of\nhumanity hangs in the balance of what\nthese six individuals are capable of, an\nendless swarm of aliens start invading Earth, and it\u2019s time for the heroes\nto unleash their abilities and fight a\nhighly outnumbered war. And from\nprevious films, we have seen what Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and The\nHulk can do. Although there is no short\nsupply of focus on their action high-lights, Avengers Assemble is absolutely\nright in not sidelining any of its team\nmembers. The less familiar, seemingly\nweaker, more human players, Romanoff\nand Barton, are given just as much time\nto shine on their own terms. Johansson\ngets to twist and bend her body as she\ntakes down multiple targets with her\nfancy moves, and Renner doesn\u2019t disappoint in another action role following\nhis impressive stint with Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. The fact that\nhe\u2019s an archer may scream snooze fest,\nbut make no mistake: with his wide\nrange of slick arrows, Hawkeye turns\ninto a valuable member of the initiative.\nSquaring off against the good guys\nis the lone-standing but insane and at\ntimes creepy Hiddleston. He has more\ndetermination and vengeful anger this\ntime around, shown very clearly in his\ndisturbing eyes and smiles, and it\u2019s a\nrole that Hiddleston commands with fiery intensity, even more so than his last\nouting with Thor.\nThe action, as expected, is breathtakingly fun, and the exhilarating excitement on screen once The Avengers\nunite under one common goal is aston-ishing. The danger with a superhero ensemble piece like this is overcrowding,\nbut within its healthy running time, all\nsix protagonists are given proper attention to, and Whedon finds that right\nbalance between full-blown action and\nspot-on humour. More superhero films\nare lined up for 2012, and Avengers Assemble has truly set the bar a lot higher.\nPlace your bets everyone, place your bets! Who\u2019ll win this fight? And here, we have the nominees for 2012\u2019s worst dressed celebrities\n\n"

However,\nhe recognised the problem the changes\nmight pose to student society and welfare events, with there no longer being a\nsingle block of time in the middle of the\nday when most students are available\nfor such activities. Heath assured the\nCouncil that he is in discussions with\nCollege in an attempt to get a guarantee that there will be at least one day\na week when all undergraduates have\ntheir lunch hour at the same time.\nRolling out with the same timetable as\nthe lunch time changes, all departments\nwill have to set aside two hours a week,\nstarting with 4pm to 6pm on Mondays\nfor all first year students in the 2012-13\nacademic year, to allow for \u2018co-curricular teaching\u2019.

The\nSabbaticals stressed that the exact shape\nof this new initiative has not yet been\nThe latest meeting of the Student Union\nCouncil was held this Tuesday. One\nof the issues that dominated the meeting was the proposed changes to the\nteaching day announced by the College\nManagement Board on 28 March. The\nboard has decided to phase out the current noon to 2pm undergraduate lunch\ntime slot, \u201cbeginning with first year\nstudents in 2012-13, and extending to\nsecond year students in 2013-14 and to\nthird year (and above) students in 201415\u201d. Instead, individual departments\nwill each choose the time when their\nstudents have a lunch hour.\nUnion President Scott Heath explained that he believed that, in prin-ciple, the change was a good way to\ngive departments more timetabling\ndecided upon and encouraged students\nto pass all suggestions onto them so that\nthey may raise them in meetings of the\nCo-Curricular Committee.\nThe final major change introduced by\nthe Management Board was the extension of the teaching on Wednesday till\n1pm. Heath outlined his strong objection to this change based on British\nUniversities & College Sports (BUCS)\nregulations state that inter-University\nsporting events can start at any time\nfrom 1pm. This would place many students in the difficult position of either\nskipping lectures and labs or missing their sporting event. The situation\nwould be particularly difficult for international students, the visa conditions\nfor many of which state that they must\nattend lectures.\nHeath believes that this change is a\nsimple oversight by the Board that arose\nas a result of a lack of consultation with\nstudents. However, he believes that this\nis part of larger problem of the Management Board not listening to student\nopinion, pointing to the Life Sciences\nrestructure and the closure of Clayponds\nas other important issues that the Union\nwas not consulted on. As a response the\nCouncil unanimously passed a resolve\ndemanding that \u201con Wednesday the\nCollege day end at twelve o\u2019clock\u201d and\nthat \u201cthe Management Board consults\nthe Student Union on any paper relating\nto student issues\u201d, further recommending that \u201cany papers considered by the\nManagement Board relating to student\nissues must be countersigned by a Sabbatical Officer to indicate that they have\nbeen considered by the Union\u201d.\nThe Council concluded with a paper\npresented by Heath proposing changes\nrelated to the Union\u2019s summer elec-tions. The Council accepted plans to\nofficially make all Welfare officers\nOfficers of the Union, giving them a\nplace on the Council where they might\nshare their expertise. Furthermore the\nseparate positions of Court Advocate,\nwhich served to provide students advice\non their dealings with the Union Court,\nwas abolished, with the Advocate duties\nbeing transferred to the Council Chair.\nThere was more discussion about\nHeath\u2019s plan to, should he be able to\nsecure the funding, introduce a postgraduate Sabbatical position. There\nwere concerns about the plans to make\nthis position separate from that of the\nGraduate Students\u2019 Association presi-dent. Heath, however, explained that he\nbelieved if the two positions were combined the new Sabbatical would find\nmost of their time occupied with organising events rather than working on\neducation issues.

Hilarity ensues as the\ntwo thirty-something year-olds\ntry to fit in whilst realising that\nthe high-school they left behind\nyears ago isn\u2019t quite the same\nanymore. The shockingly brilliant Johnny Depp cameo is a\nhuge plus.\nThe Hunger Games\nA thought-provoking, futuristic\nthriller that is superbly acted\nespecially from the young\nmembers of its cast (Jennifer\nLawrence, Josh Hutcherson),\nas two of 24 teenagers forced\nto fight to their deaths until\nthere is one victor, whilst the\nwhole world watches them\nfor amusement.

Add to that there is actually no moment of genuine\ntension due to so many absurd plot developments and\nsilly characters. Most definitely one to avoid and ignore.\nAct of Valour\nA shamelessly patriotic film\nmade by Americans, for Americans: real U.S. SEALs were\nused for this, which more\nthan explains the stilted act-ing. Holding them back more\nis the paper-thin script that\ngives us no insight into any of\nits characters, and so even its\nattempt at tear-jerking drama\nnever quite works. The combat scenes however, are undeniably impressive. Think of it\nas a fancy recruitment piece.\nThe Raven\nWhen a deranged psychopath decides to reenact all\nthe grizzly murders written in\nEdgar Allan Poe\u2019s gothic horror stories, it is up to the author himself (an eccentric yet\noddly brilliant John Cusack)\nto outsmart this obsessed-fan-turned-serial-killer. Part\ntorture horror, part detective\nthriller, part period drama, it\u2019s\nan entertaining enough, yet\nnot-at-all deep, exploration of\nthe much-celebrated novelist.\nIn Darkness\nLast year\u2019s Oscar Best Foreign Language Film nominee,\nthis extraordinary true story of\nan initially greedy city plumber (Robert Wieckiewicz, on\ntop form) hiding a dozen or\nso Jews in the complicated\nunderground sewers during\nWorld War II, is both a haunting and deeply touching tale.\nIt\u2019s long, with its fair share of\nheavily dramatised moments,\nbut the final emotional payoff\nis well worth waiting for.\nBattleship\nFive far superior and technologically advanced alien ships\nland on Earth after nosy scientists thought it would be\na good idea to bother them\non their own planet. Now the\nfate humanity rests on three\nhuman navy ships as they go\nhead-to-head. Sounds ridiculous and, for the most part, it\nis, but the carefully crafted action scenes are so entertaining that you might not even\nnotice the film\u2019s many holes.\nThis Must Be the Place\nPlaying a retired rock star\nwho goes on a journey of self-discovery following the death\nof his father, the usually intense and fiery Sean Penn\u2019s\nincredibly soft-spoken, gentle\nperformance is the absolute\nhighlight of this otherwise\nslightly chaotic and messy\nroad-trip movie in which the\nlong-lost son seeks out the\nman who humiliated his recently passed father during\nWorld War Two.\nJohn Carter\nThis box-office failure will cost\nDisney around 200 million dollars but financial loss doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily mean bad film.\nBurdened with an unappealing title, an unknown hero and\ngiant insect aliens, there is no\nway this could have marketed\nwell enough to pull in the big\ncrowd. But Disney\u2019s latest attempt at the superhero genre\nremains an entertaining spec-tacle, full of colourful images\nand breath-taking action.\nBel Ami\nR-Patz decides to stick his\nschlong where it doesn\u2019t be-long, sleeping his way through\nthe richest, most powerful married women in 1880s Paris,\nFrance. The three ladies who\nfall for his looks (Uma Thurman,\nKristin Scott Thomas, Christina\nRicci) fare better than Pattinson\u2019s rather one-dimensional\nperformance, but the film\u2019s\nsensual ambiance almost\nmakes up for the leading man\u2019s\nlack of magnetic charisma.\nWe Bought a Zoo\nMatt Damon is a widower who\ndoesn\u2019t have a clue on how to\nraise his two kids.

Difficulties lie ahead,\nincluding his angry son, money\nproblems, pedantic zoo inspec-tors, and escaping animals. It\ndoes take forever to get to its\npredictable happy ending, but\nDamon\u2019s likable performance\nkeeps everything together.\nMirror Mirror\nThe tacky marketing doesn\u2019t\ndo this film justice. It may not\nbe a radical reimagination of\nthe classic tale but with director Tarsem Singh\u2019s focus on\ndazzling visuals and stunning\ncostumes, the first \u201cSnow\nWhite\u201d adaptation of 2012, is\nworth checking out. Julia Roberts is at her hilarious best\nas the evil queen, Lily Collins\nis innocently beautiful, and\nArmie Hammer is effortlessly\ncharming as the prince.\nContraband\nAlthough retired from his life\nof illegal smuggling, family\nman Chris (Mark Wahlberg)\nis forced back into pulling\none last job for his screw-up\nbrother-in-law who ends up\nowing money to dangerous\nmen. There are moments of\ngenuine tension, but it\u2019s more\nof a rehash of the same thing.\nWahlberg doesn\u2019t disappoint\nin an easy role, and he\u2019s supported by the suitably insane\nGiovanni Ribisi as the villain.\nWrath of the Titans\nThis time, unlike its predeces-sor, there are actual Titans, but\neverything else is a mess. The\nplot and character developments don\u2019t make any sense,\nand despite the loud action\nsequences, the film doesn\u2019t\nknow what to do with Perseus\n(Sam Worthington). Once\nagain tasked with saving the\nworld from evil Greek Gods, he\nembarks on a dull quest with\nabsolutely useless \u201cwarriors\u201d\n(e.g. Rosamund Pike).\nSalmon Fishing in the\nYemen\nTwo of the most likable actors from Britain (Emily Blunt,\nEwan McGregor) form a sweet\nand charming duo in this sugary sweet rom-com. What they\nget up to is dead predictable\nfrom its uninspired title, but\nLasse Hallestrom\u2019s latest is\na highly enjoyable blend of\ndrama and comedy, the latter\nthanks to the priceless Kristin\nScott Thomas.\n\n"
