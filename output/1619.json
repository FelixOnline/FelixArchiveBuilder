Nevertheless, the\nwarm-up went smoothly, with not\none ball dropped and everyone\nseeming ready for a fight.\nIC\u2019s CPS started. A strong run\nfrom Kent\u2019s hooker and two falloff tackles later, Kent were bearing\ndown in IC\u2019s 22. A fast few phases\nfrom Kent\u2019s forwards and a quick\nball out to the backs saw Kent score\na try not even five minutes into the\ngame. Shock and disappointment\nwas ubiquitous with most of the\nteam wondering how on earth\nthey were going to impress the\nRVC Netballers that night if they\ndidn\u2019t win. This, and the odd word\nof inspiration from the captain,\nspurred the boys into gear.\nA strong restart from our fly-half\npositioned the forwards deep in\nopposition territory. A penalty was\ngiven right in front of the posts.\nCentre, Sam Moorby, stepped up,\nsomehow managing to send it right\noff the posts with a kick as pitiful as\nhis hairline.\nThe lineouts were going brilliantly\ndespite the gale-force winds. Strong\nphase play carried by flanker and\nbanter factory, Alex Clayton, saw\nSecond Row, Toby Simpson, crash\nover the whitewash for IC\u2019s first try.\nMoorby converted, making up for\nhis atrocious first attempt.\nAnother bit of brilliant play\nresulted in Imperial crashing back\nup the pitch, leaving their boot\ninches away from Kent\u2019s private\nparts. Ali Zaboronsky lashed out at\nthe ref\u2019s ankle, seeking to remove\nany competition with the ladies that\nevening.\nScrum half, Matthew Blackett,\norganised well and questioned the\nKent defence with lots of darting\nruns. The forwards were carrying\nreally well in tight pods with author\nof this article, Clayton, leading the\ncharge, almost as if he were a man\nof average height. Kent struggled\nwith his silky smooth footwork,\ndashing good looks and straight\narm denying their tackles.\nQuick ball from the scrum and\nsome more great rucking resulted in\nSimpson\u2019ssecondtry. Thebackswere\nstarting to look really dangerous\nand Moorby soon got a try of his\nown. Both conversion attempts\nwere successful, bringing the score\nto 21-5. Simpson seemed eager to\nscore another five, unfortunately\nblowing his load prematurely and\ndropping the ball over the line. Low\nmorale ensued from a blatant hattrick avoidance.\nKent\u2019s winter bulk programme\nhad evidently been more effective\nthan ours as they dominated the\nscrum. Kent used this to their\nadvantage, crossing over the line\nto score their second try. If only\nMartin Head\u2019s legs were as big as\nhis arms,they may have been able to\nhold on. Final score was 21-12 and\nMOTM was deservedly awarded\nto Alex Clayton for an outstanding,\nnay astonishing performance.\nUp you get, lads.

Photo Credit: Oldskin\nRob Garside\nWriter\nBarnett brilliant at Postbahnhof\nSometimes I sit and think,\nsometimes I just sit, and this time\nI use side doors. One has to say, it\u2019s\nincredibly hard to resist the excellent\nnoises delivered by a bunch of milk\naddicts, and nearly impossible to\npay no heed to an aussie singer-songwriter who has \u201csevere\nallergies, a hint of hypochondria,\nand a paramedic brother,\u201d which all\ncame across as inspiration for the\nheart-tickling short story \u2018Avant\nGardener\u2019.\nGiven warning about the crappy\nsound quality at Postbahnhof by\na friend from Berlin, I was a little\nskeptical at first, but soon we had an\norganic apple, a Club-Mate, and got\non the ride \u2013 after all, things can\u2019t\ngo amiss with a Courtney Barnett\nshow.\nThe whole place was like a giant\nwarehouse, where you can imagine\npeople in cropped Levis, glittery\ndresses, and cult ankle-boots\nthrowing adrenaline-kicking gigs\nall night long if it was set up in\nLondon. Girls in baggy jumpsuits,\nwith natural side swept bangs and\nzero makeup, and middle aged men\nwith less mobile ring fingers will be\nsomething you see at a Courtney\ngig, or at least a Courtney gig in\nDeutschland.\nThe show kicked off right after the\nsupport band Big Scary, as the trio\nwalked in in their habitual deadpan\nway. Just as always, the drum beat\nintro of \u2018Dead Fox\u2019 hit me hard\n\u2013 a song originating from strong\nsupport for local shops over big\nsupermarkets, spiced with a touch\nof political connotation.\nFunnily enough, it reminded\nme of another song, \u2018David\u2019, from\nthe double EP, A Sea of Split Peas\n(released in 2013), with a smack of\nminimalism and environmentalism:\n\u201cCome on Davey, let\u2019s go plant a\ntree / You bring the spade, I\u2019ll bring\nthe seeds.\u201d\nSadly I can\u2019t remember the next\none but I am pretty sure \u2018Elevator\nY\nou\u2019ve seen the various\nmemes about Donald\nTrump, you know Hillary\nClinton is a shoo-in\nfor the first female president, and\nyou\u2019ve watched Bernie Sanders\u2019\nrousing speech on socialism, but\nyou still have no idea what is\ngoing on in the US election. Why\nis Bush polling so poorly (No, not\nGeorge W. And no, not George\nSr. either. The other one. Jeb!)?\nWho on earth is Martin O\u2019Malley?\nIs Marco Rubio the Republican\nParty\u2019s Obama? Well fret not! Now,\nthanks to Election 2016 hosted by\nBilly Micou and Varun Mann, you\ncan keep up to date with the most\nimportant exercise of democracy on\nthe planet and gain the intellectual\nammunition to shut down that one\nsocial activist friend when they start\nrunning their yap after a couple of\npints in the Union.\nBilly and Varun talk through the\nweek\u2019s global events and their impact\nontheUSpoliticallandscape,backed\nup by facts, polls and soundbites, to\nprovide an intellectual commentary\nthat Paxman could only dream of.\nCritique of both sides is guaranteed,\nfrom Clinton\u2019s secret affair with your\nfuture employers on Wall Street, to\nthe inane ramblings of Ben Carson,\nthe hypocrisy of all presidential\ncandidates is ridiculed both fairly\nand concisely. It\u2019s not all high brow\nstuff though, this election cycle has\nplenty enough fools. Combine this\nwith the wit of the political duo and\nthe occasional song, the mood is\nkept entertaining \u2013 think more \u2018This\nWeek\u2019 than \u2018Question Time\u2019.\nIf listening is too passive for one\nas erudite as yourself and you\u2019d like\nto have a say on the views spouted\nfrom the deluge of GOP candidates,\nor those of the hosts themselves,\nBilly and Varun are looking for\nguests to discuss particular subjects\nfor 10-15 minute segments.

That\u2019s how\nI would describe Courtney Barnett\nand her crazy clique and their very\nbest music. They simply know how\nto capture the mundanity of real\nlife subjects and sing about it with\nmundane delivery.\nNot seeing her at O2 was an easy\ndecision to make, although I later\nhad to deal with the pain of taking a\nhuge amount of time to unsubscribe\nfrom a German event website (and I\n#hugedanny. Photo Credit: Danny L Harle\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nJingyuan Feng\nWriter\nD\nanny L Harle\u2019s Broken\nFlowers is the first official\nPC Music release on\nColumbia Records. Up until now\nevery single or EP produced by\nthe net label has been available to\ndownload for free online. So, you\u2019d\nexpect their first commercial release\nto be something special. This isn\u2019t the\nfuture-electro that PC Music have\nestablished a cyber-cult around; it\u2019s\nradio-friendly music designed and\nperfected for mainstream audiences.\nHarle has studied pop and distilled\nit. He plays with the idea of what\nan EP can be, with the last track,\n\u2018Awake For Hours\u2019 a complex and\naccelerated remix of the first. They\nare different enough that, initially,\nyou might not notice their shared\nvocals. However, in reworking the\nsong, he adds squeaky, harsh synths,\nbreaking up the tropical production\nof \u2018Broken Flowers\u2019 into something\nmore jittery and impulsive. It\u2019s the\nsort of track you might listen to\nafter five shots of espresso.\n\u2018Forever\u2019 is less innovative. It\nbegins with bleepy synths, a worn\nout staple of PC Music, but is still\nimmensely addictive. \u2018Without You\u2019\nslows things down as yet another\nunnamed female vocalist sings:\n\u201cSometimes I feel, maybe, this\ncould be real.\u201d Broken Flowers defies\nthe sceptics who believe PC Music\naren\u2019t serious. They\u2019re real and no\none makes better pop music.\nM\nanchester\u2019s Old\nSkin\u2019s final release\nis a furious, bleak,\nsuffocating affair.\nOriginally intended to be released in\nthe new year on Holy Roar Records,\nOld Skin made the decision\nin the wake of their somewhat\ninevitable break up to release their\nrecorded album for free. It is with\nno exaggeration, however, that this\nis Old Skin\u2019s most complete and\nambitious work.\nMusically, Old Skin are a very\ninteresting proposition as they take\nadvantage of their vocalists deep\npercussive vocals by placing them\nunusually far down in the mix.\nWith the vocals sitting alongside\nthe rhythm guitar, they allow the\nlead guitar to provide the mood and\nmelody of their songs. This works\nparticularly well on the slower\nbuilding tracks of the album, where\nthe vocals are allowed to come in\nlate to the songs, adding an urgency\na desperate funeral march drum\nbeat accompanied by a poignant\nguitar line the transitions into a\nheavy hardcore section before finally\nmoving to a thrilling, gang vocal led\ncloser.\nIt\u2019s a real shame to see the end of\nOld Skin, like previous exciting UK\nhardcore bands (Esoteric Youth,\nBastions, and Kerouac) their career\nhas ended far too soon,but their last\nalbum is absolutely their best work.\nIt\u2019s a moving, atmospheric and\nexciting record.\nOut now on Bandcamp\nto the building atmosphere.\nThe title track of this album is\na great example of this. The song\nbegins with a wall of noisy feedback\nand tribal drumming before\nintroducing dark minimalist guitars,\nbuilding up a brooding atmosphere.\nThe song suddenly switches midway\nthrough,with the vocals introducing\nheavily distorted guitars (like Trap\nThem level distortion) creating a\npummelling and fierce end to the\nsong.\nThe album really showcases the\nbreadth of Old Skins influences\nand sensibilities. There are the\nfaster aggressive Converge-esque\nsongs that lead the album, such\nas the exhilarating \u2018Deadfall\u2019 and\nthe powerviolence themed \u2018Dead\nand Gone\u2019, to doomy post metal\ninfluences (i.e. ISIS) showing in\nlater more atmospheric songs (such\nas the creepy \u2018Spoil\u2019).\n\u2018Bury me\u2019, the triumphant\ncloser of the album, demonstrates\nthis composite style excellently\ndrawing together the different\nfacets that Old Skin have displayed\nthroughout the album. It starts with\nThis is\nOld Skin\u2019s\nmost\ncomplete\nand\nambitious\nwork\nAll eyes on Courtney Barnett and her band-mates. Photo Credit: Jingyuan Feng\nIt was\nalmost like\nwatching\nWoody\nAllen from\nafar\nThere are\nthings\nbetter than\nsex and\ndrugs and\nthey are\nsausage\nrolls\nOperator\u2019 was the third or fourth\nsong they played, which was when\nthe apple kicked in.It started to give\nus goosebumps. It was almost like\nwatching Woody Allen from afar;\neverything was hazy, like digesting a\nset of ordered stories of ridicule and\nrationale flowing out of his mouth.\nHe said \u201cI think you\u2019re projecting\nthe way that you\u2019re feeling.

As I quietly entered the\nroom to stand at the back of the bar,\nDavid Elms made his way on stage,\nacoustic guitar in hand.He talked to\nthe crowd politely and surprisingly\nquietly, smoothing them into his set\nwith boyish charm.\nStanding at the front of the stage,\nas still as a statue, he delivered\nhilarious jokes in a mild, deadpan\nstyle that thrilled his audience. We\nwere led down a winding path of\nback catalogue stories from his life,\nonly to be surprised with sudden\nchanges in tone and direction.

He alternated between these\npoignant moments \u2013 almost causing\nthe crowd to well up \u2013 and cracking\nout jokes that caused uncontrollable\nexplosions of laughter.

With the unrest around\nhim and his steady mental and\nphysical decline at that point, it is\nno wonder that his paintings were\nbleak and pessimistic. However,\nin an amazing exhibition at the\nNational Gallery, I discovered an\nentirely new dimension to the\nSpanish painter \u2013 one that reveals\nhim as an observer of people and a\ndocumenter of his time.\nIn this largest-ever exhibition of\nGoya\u2019s portraits, with works on loan\nfrom all over the world,his expansive\nrepertoire is explored from his\nearly days as a court painter of the\naristocracy, to intimate and honest\nportraits of his closest friends.\nOften described as both the last\nof the great masters and the first\nof the modernists, Goya straddled\nthe tumultuous times between\nthe 18th\nand 19th\ncenturies \u2013 the\nunrest of the neighbouring French\nrevolution, the civil unrest in Spain,\nand the French invasion were all\nreflected in his work. At the same\ntime, while his earlier portraits were\nvery classical, taking after masters\nlike Velazquez, some of his later\nworks developed the beginnings of\nimpressionism.There is a continuity\nin his paintings, with the same\nsubjects often appearing in different\npaintings at different stages of their\nlives. The Marchioness of Santa Cruz,\nwho appears in his 1805 painting\nas a modern muse, was first painted\nas a four-year-old girl in his group\nportrait of the Osuna family.\nWe are presented with a man\nwho is fiercely adaptable, expertly\nmanoeuvring his way through the\nsocio-political landscape around\nhim and constantly affirming his\nrelevance to the people in power. As\na court painter early in his career,his\nstyle was modern, favoured among\nthe aristocrats for its alignment\nwith enlightened principles. After\na devastating illness in 1793 that\nleft him profoundly deaf, painting\nportraits became Goya\u2019s method of\ncommunicating with his subjects.\nOne of his most magnificent works\nis a full-length portrait of his great\nfriend, the Duchess of Alba, one\nof the patrons who brought him\nsecurity and encouraged his career\nas a painter. Haughty and graceful\nin her traditional Spanish lace,\nshe points to an inscription on the\nfloor \u2013 \u201conly Goya\u201d \u2013 a sign of his\npopularity among the aristocrats at\ncourt.\nEven following the 1808 popular\nuprising in Spain, a time of great\npolitical upheaval, Goya\u2019s skills as a\nportraitist gave him the flexibility to\nadapt his work to the needs of those\nin power \u2013 be they the enlightened,\nthe reactionary, the French or the\nEnglish. And, even as a portraitist,\nGoya recorded the unrest of the\ntime in the images of the people he\npainted. In his study for The Duke of\nWellington, he is uncompromising in\nthe depiction of the toll war can take\non a man \u2013 with drooping eyelids\nand sunken cheeks, the haunting\nsketch is Goya\u2019s commentary on the\nmilitary conflict around him.\nTo me, Goya\u2019s portraits of his\nclose friends and family were far\nmore poignant than those he made\nof the aristocracy. His portrait\nof Martin Zapater, for example,\nexpresses palpable tenderness and\nsensitivity. This childhood friend\nis painted with almost startling\nimmediacy, as are many of his more\nprivate collections.\nThe honesty of his portraits\nextends to depictions of himself \u2013\nin one of them, an aged, unkempt\nGoya glances at his own reflection,\nrevealing scruffy grey hair and tired\neyes. This tired man is the same\none shown in a painting in one of\nthe earlier rooms, standing in deep\nconcentration before an easel with\ncandles adorning his hat \u2013 meant to\ncast just the right amount of light\non his subjects for his paintings.\nThe painting that left the greatest\nimpression on me was found in\nthe last room. In Self Portrait with\nDoctor Arrieta, Goya is weak in the\narms of his doctor, who is trying\nto feed him what is presumably\nmedication. Shadowy figures\nlurk in the background, perhaps\nthe personification of his mental\ndemons. The exhaustion and\nNational Gallery\u2019s dedicated show the most thorough exploration of Spanish master\u2019s portraits\nGoya\u2019s Self Portrait with Doctor Arrieta. Photo Credit: National Gallery\nThe honesty\nof his\nportraits\nextends to\ndepictions of\nhimself\nresignation in his eyes as he pulls\nat his sheets reflects his difficult\nsurvival of the illness that almost\nkilled him in 1819. Inscribed with\na note of thanks to his doctor, this\nunusual work is the culmination of\nGoya\u2019s painterly accomplishments:\nhonesty in depicting himself,\na connection with the people\naround him, symbolic purpose and\nimpeccable technique.\nThis exhibition is bold, an\nunfettered display purely made up\nportraits, yet is astute in its curation\nand organisation of the many facets\nof Goya\u2019s portraiture career.Through\nhis paintings of people alone, we\nare brought on a journey through\nsocio-political unrest, intellectual\nmovements and his tumultuous\npersonal life \u2013 a must-see for anyone\ninterested in the Spanish master.\nGoya: The Portraits is on till 10 Jan\n2016.

With the cheapest\nmain course coming in at \u00a328,\nthey weren\u2019t far from wrong, but I\nquickly assuaged them with the fact\nthat the three-course lunchtime set\nmenu would only be \u00a338 a piece,\nwhich, given the occasion and my\ndesire to visit this culinary temple, I\nwas more than willing to hand over.\nEver since I took a serious, career-based interest in cooking, Heston\nBlumenthal has been one of my\ninspirational figures, combining\nboth scientific technique and\ngastronomic smarts. My longing\nto visit one of his restaurants has\nincreased year after year. Naturally, I\njumped on the opportunity when it\npresented itself this term. Booking\na table was done easily online a\nmonth or so in advance, as we\nweren\u2019t heading in for an evening\nshowing of the culinary arts \u2013 the\nset menu only runs at lunchtimes.\nThen, the long wait began.\nI already had one of Heston\u2019s\ncookbooks \u2013 Historic Heston. It\u2019s\na journey through his amazing\ninvestigation of historic and often\nforgotten recipes, combinations and\ntechniques. Whilst he often derives\ninspiration loosely from original\nideas, his end results are very\nmodern interpretations, and would\nI am a savoury\nman, but\neven I was\nenraptured by\nthe delicate\ncustard\nFELIX reviews Heston Blumenthal\u2019s \u2018Dinner\u2019 in Knightsbridge\nBoth dishes\ndelivered\nbold, punchy\ncombinations\nNot quite like how your mama makes it. Photo Credit: Sanjay Bhattacharya\nnot be instantly recognisable to\nthe authors! I had this in mind\nwhen I had a look at the set menu\nthe morning of the lunch, and\nwas pleased to see a few dishes I\nrecognised. I had pre-agreed with\nmy girlfriend to each choose a\ndifferent option for each course so\nas to try the full variety \u2013 and it\nhappened to suit our tastes as well.\nWe set out to Knightsbridge,\nand found ourselves outside\nthe Mandarin Oriental Hotel.\nWeaving our way through the\narchways and columns, we were\nescorted to Dinner, where we had\na lovely table with a view over\nHyde Park. The d\u00e9cor is fittingly\neccentric, with porcelain jelly\nmoulds as light fittings, scattered\nchilli plants and other oddities.\nA charming host presented us\nwith the menus, and we chose to\nhave some cocktails \u2013 being more\nattracted by their adventurous\nblends than the (expensive)\nofferings from the wine list. With\nmy rosemary-infused Sargasso\nSea (very refreshing, if almost\ntoo herbal) and my girlfriend\u2019s\nEmoliente Sour (she made the\nbetter choice \u2013 sweet and subtle,\nwith lavender that didn\u2019t, for once,\nmake me think of soap),we ordered\nour food and tucked into the\ndelicious wholemeal sourdough\nand unpasteurised butter. It was\nbloody good bread, but even my\nrefined (read: pretentious) palate\ncouldn\u2019t really tell that it was\nunpasteurized butter, though it was\nindeed golden and luscious.\nArriving on simple white china,\nmy ragu of pig\u2019s ears was certainly\nnot as pretty as my girlfriend\u2019s\nlemon salad \u2013 a bright, summery\nplate of smoked artichokes, goat\u2019s\ncurd, pickled beetroot and radishes.\nThe contrast between the two\ndishes was apparent \u2013 mine, rich\nand unctuous, had a hearty slice of\ntoast underneath that soaked up\nall the rich meaty juices. The ears\n(yes, offal is off-putting to some\nbut I try almost anything) had\nbeen cooked to perfect succulency,\nand were offset by a slight hint\nof vinegar. Caramelised onions\nrounded out the whole compilation\nof flavours, and I was in heaven. My\ngirlfriend was just as happy \u2013 the\ndelicate, tangy curd had just the\nright consistency to compliment\nthe smoked artichokes, and crisp\nradishes and beetroots leant\nrefreshing bite to the party. I was\nthrilled \u2013 so many people, including\nchefs who I\u2019ve worked with, said\nthat I should not set my hopes too\nhigh. Yet, the chefs at Dinner, and\nHeston himself, had delivered.\nWhilst relatively technically simple,\nboth dishes delivered bold, punchy\ncombinations that were what I had\nexpected. I eagerly awaited the\narrival of our main courses.\nOnce again, I was thrilled, and\nhighly impressed. Juicy braised\npork belly, with an umami sauce to\nadd another dimension of richness\nand flavour. It made for a delicious\naccompaniment to lightly cooked\nhispi cabbage that was perfused\nwith delicate shreds of salty ham\nhock. A leaf of intense herbed gel\nintertwined with the cabbage, and\neverything was given the most\nperfect crunch with some pork\npuffs, or deep-fried dehydrated\npork skin, producing some powerful\npiggy flavour. Again, relatively\nfew components, but all flawlessly\ncooked. That was the precision I\nhad been looking for, and it was also\nevident in my girlfriend\u2019s perfectly\ncooked pollock. A white fish that\nhas always been reminiscent of\npoorly-made school dinner fish and\nchips, pollock\u2019s subtle flavour is well\nworth the gentle cooking it had\nbeen given. With delicate brown\nshrimp, tangy capers and creamy\npea puree (such a vivid green), one\nlook at her face confirmed that we\nmade the right choice by booking\na table. Being the greedy bugger\nthat I am, I hankered after that\nlittle bit more of both dishes, but\nwas still pleasantly surprised by the\nhandsome portions of both fish and\nflesh. Feeling extremely lucky, both\nwith my company and the meal, we\nmoved onto desserts.\nNow, I should mention \u2013 I am\na savoury man. But even I was\nenraptured by the delicate custard\nthat filled my prune and tamarind\ntart, along with crispy, almost\ncaramelised shortcrust pastry. The\nwhole work of art was brought\ntogether by the custard\u2019s torched,\nbr\u00dbl\u00e9ed top \u2013 such a crisp, satisfying\nskin. My girlfriend loves cr\u00e8me\nbr\u00dbl\u00e9e, but was equally impressed\nby her bitter cocoa mousse paired\nwith sweet honey ice cream and a\ntangy grapefruit gel. With a subtle\nhint of yuzu (a Japanese relative\nof the grapefruit) permeating the\nchocolate, it offered a very clean,\nrefreshing end to the meal, or so\nwe thought. Not so fast \u2013 a delicate\npost-dessert dessert arrived \u2013 and\nthis was my favourite part. Slightly\nsalted, a long, thin caraway biscuit\nwas presented with a tablespoon-sized portion of an amazingly\nrich chocolate mousse, this time\nflavoured with Earl Grey. Wow.\nThis was the flavour combination I\nenjoyed the most out of everything\nwe tried so far. It was rich, yet salty\nand crispy \u2013 everything I really\nenjoy in a pudding \u2013 but combining\nit with the fleeting, whimsical taste\nof Earl Grey put the dessert on\nanother level entirely. It\u2019s a mixture\nI\u2019m going to look into more, and\nout of everything was the element I\nwanted to replicate the most.\nSo, having settled the damage,\nwe left fully content. Whilst\nmuch cheaper than other two-star\nMichelin restaurants, Dinner is\nnot the cheapest place in London\nto dine at. However, the standard\nof service (which, needless to say,\nwas impeccable throughout) and\ncuisine that you receive, it really is\nworth every penny, if not more. I\u2019m\nalready looking into getting a table\nfor our two-year anniversary (yes,\nwe\u2019ll be sodding the cost and going\na la carte).If there\u2019s someone in your\nlife you want to treat, or if you\u2019re\nsimply looking to indulge yourself,\ndon\u2019t hesitate. That being said, I\nguess there are some sweet Nando\u2019s\ndiscounts available too.\nSANJAY BHATTACHARYA\n\n"

A relatively new\nphenomenon is the concept of\nthe \u2018indie developer\u2019; while game\nproduction was previously reserved\nfor big-budget, AAA developers,\nthe emergence of platforms such as\nSteam, as well as the downloadable\nstores on PlayStation and Xbox,\nnow afford independents a shot at\nthe market.\nIndie Game:The Movie is a fantastic\nKickstarter-funded film that\nfollows the development cycle for\nthree such developers going down\nthe surprising route of describing\nthe real hardships these creatives\ngo through to get their games out.\nI went into this movie expecting a\nfairly broad look at the industry \u2013\nwhat I got was an in-depth character\nstudy of some truly dedicated and\nburdened men. At times, the film\nis genuinely hard to watch, as we\nsee what these men have sacrificed\nto produce their game. We see\nthem cut off their family members,\nexperience depression, and even\nbreak down in parts.\nFirst we are introduced to Edward\nMcMillen and Tommy Refenes, the\nmen behind Super Meat Boy \u2013 an\nintensely difficult 2D platformer\nwhich went on to sell one million\ncopies.These men \u2013 charismatic and\nenthusiastic \u2013 are the people we can\nbest empathise with in the film, but\nwe begin to see them deteriorate as\ndeadlines close in. We can also see\nwhat their project means to them\n\u2013 \u201cI made it for myself\u201d, Edmund\nexplains at one point.\nIn direct contrast, we have Phil\nFish, who when we first meet him,\nhad been working on his game, Fez,\nfor countless years. Somewhat of\nan unlikable character, Fish spends\nthe majority of his time angrily\ndefending his game from \u2018haters\u2019\nand complaining angrily about an\nex-business partner. He remains a\ncontroversial figure following the\nfilm\u2019s release and he even cancelled\nFez 2 after an online argument with\na journalist who called him a \u2018bitter\nhipster\u2019.\nThe character we sadly spend the\nleast time with is Jonathan Blow,\nwhose game, Braid, is the only of\nthe three featured I have properly\nplayed. It\u2019s an incredibly popular\nand intelligent time-twisting puzzle\ngame and a critical darling.Yet Blow\ncould well be the most pretentious\nman you will ever meet \u2013 he is in\nequal parts hilarious and totally\ninsufferable.One of best moments in\nany documentary I\u2019ve seen involves\nhim dramatically lamenting over\nreviewers and YouTubers who are\nenjoying his game, but not grasping\nthe depth of his artistic vision.\nDespite all this though, Blow is still\na deeply intelligent creative, who is\ngenuinely fascinating to listen to.\nWhat all these stories amount to\nis a fantastically well put-together\nand honestly quite emotional\nfilm. We really begin to feel for\nthese developers, as we see some\nof the things they had to sacrifice\nfor success. Even if you\u2019re not a\nparticular fan of video games, Indie\nGame:The Movie raises sad questions\nabout whether the appeal of artistic\nfreedom and chance of success\nin this medium are even worth\nthe struggle \u2013 I wholeheartedly\nrecommend it.\nJonathan Blow: indie developer and sex god Photo Credit: Indie Game: The Movie PR\nThe unstoppable march of the YA dystopia\nW\nhen the first Hunger\nGames film was\nreleased back in\nMarch 2012, I was\nstill in secondary school, preparing\nfor the end of my final year and the\nsubsequent upheaval of moving to\nuniversity.It was either that summer\nor the summer before that that I\nsat down and devoured Suzanne\nCollins\u2019 YA trilogy, racing against\nthe looming deadline that would see\nme make my transferral to the adult\nworld where I would put away my\nchildish things, no longer having an\nexcuse to read fiction aimed at an\naudience several years younger than\nI was at the time.\nNow, here we are, three and a half\nyears later, and the final instalment\nof the series has just been released:\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013\nPart 2, again marking the end of\nan era. Many of those my age have\nleft higher education, and are now\ntaking their first tentative steps into\nthe \u2018real\u2019world, living out their Lena\nDunham-esque fantasies of rising\nrentpricesandinsecureemployment.\nIn that time, the cultural landscape\nhas shifted beneath our feet; where\nonce vampires and wizards were par\nfor the course in Young Adult (YA)\nfiction, now dystopia is king.\nThe last three years have seen a\nproliferation in dystopian fiction\nwhose film adaptations approach\nwith a sense of weary inevitability.\nThe last year alone has seen films in\nThe Hunger Games, Divergent, and\nMaze Runner series, all of which\nfeature plucky teens facing an\noppressive power structure helmed\nby adults. Of course, dystopia has\nbeen a popular genre for years, with\nBrave New World, 1984, and The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale all leaving their\nmarks on impressionable young\nminds. What seems different now is\nthe pace with which new books and\nfilms are released,which has reached\nan almost oppressive onslaught.\nSurely this bubble soon must pop,as\nteens, shot through with fickleness,\nmove on to the next big thing.\nThe trend, however, only seems to\nbe increasing.At the time of writing,\nthe latest of The Hunger Games films,\nin cinemas barely a week, has taken\nnearly $250 million. The other\nseries are also in ruddy financial\nhealth: not a single film from The\nHunger Games, Divergent, or Maze\nRunner series has failed to make a\nsubstantial profit. The first Maze\nRunner film, made on a budget of\n$34 million, took more than ten\ntimes that in box office takings; The\nHunger Games series has grossed\naround $2.5 billion. While critics\nmay be largely ambivalent about\nthe films, the public is lapping\nit up as the films garner MTV\naccolades, People\u2019s Choice Awards,\nand gargantuan profits. It seems\ndystopian films are a guaranteed\nsmash hit.\nWhy are they so popular, and\nwhy now? Several have identified\nthe obvious analogy for the high\nschool experience, an idea that\nperhaps doesn\u2019t transfer seamlessly\nover to the UK system. Dana\nStevens, writing in Slate, said that\ndystopian fiction \u201cexternalises the\nturmoil that\u2019s already taking place\nin adolescents\u2019 minds, hearts, and\nbodies\u201d. For Tom Shaw, the brutal\nkilling in The Hunger Games is\nthe perfect analogy for the quest\ntowards perfection and popularity\ntaking place at schools up and down\nthe country: The Hunger Games,\nShaw says, \u201cis the story of a girl\nwho\u2019s voted the homecoming queen\nof the world\u201d. While the double-edged sword of popularity has been\nexplored by films such as Mean Girls,\nHeathers, and Carrie, this new wave\nof dystopian cinema seems to be\nupping the ante, perhaps reflecting\nthe increased pressures media\nlike Instagram and Twitter have\nwrought on the teenage microcosm.\nFor fans of Divergent, the\nanalogies with school become\neven more obvious: set in a future\nChicago, society is divided into\nfive poorly-named factions, based\non personal traits. Those who do\nnot acquiesce with the system and\nconform to one of the five mind-sets are \u2018Factionless\u2019, and have no\nsocial worth. As Tom Stone in The\nGuardian said, Divergent is about \u2018A\n16-year-old girl trying to find her\nplace in a world modelled on a series\nof frat houses\u2019. In order to survive,\nTris Prior (Shailene Woodley)\nmust disguise the fact that she is\n\u2018divergent\u2019, placing her light under\na bushel in order to fit in. It\u2019s a\nnarrative familiar to teenagers up\nand down the country who have to\nsand off parts of their personality in\norder to fit the space they\u2019ve been\nallocated.\nIn contrast, Andrew O\u2019Hehir,\nwriting in Salon, seems to think that\nthese books mask a sinister message\nabout individualism and libertarian\nideals. For him, Divergent and\nThe Hunger Games are \u201ccapitalist\nagitprop\u201d, \u201cpropaganda for the\nethos of individualism, the central\nideology of consumer capitalism\u201d.\nThis theory centres around the idea\nthatsuchnovelsfeatureanindividual\nprotagonist who overcomes extreme\noppression (typically in the form of\nbig government) in order to defend\ntheir right to express themselves.\nThe upshot of the films, O\u2019Hehir\nwrites,is that they \u201cremind ourselves\nhow grateful we should be to live in\na society where we can be \u2018ourselves\u2019,\nwhere we can enjoy unspecified\nand vague freedoms\u201d. It is an idea\npicked up by Ewan Morrison in The\nGuardian, who sees the oppressive\nantagonists of the films as symbols,\nnot of power gone awry, but of\nstates and community which the\nindividual must overcome in order\nto thrive. The Hunger Games, under\nthis reading, becomes a Randian\nstruggle for independence, where\nsocial parasites must be killed in\norder for the individual to realise\ntheir true potential.\nIt is true that these series promote\nthe idea of uniqueness; sitting in the\ncinema, the anonymous teen can\nidentify with the main character\nfor a few hours, imagining a world\nwhere they have left their suburban\nexistence behind and become\nworld-famous. While previous\npopular film and book series,such as\nHarry Potter and the Twilight series,\nfeature protagonists thrust into the\nspotlight, where the dystopias differ\nis in how violent they are. In the\nmedia popular just 5 years ago,it was\nenough for the individual to rise;\nnow, not only must the individual\nsucceed, but others must fall. In The\nHunger Games, where the pressures\nof society force adolescents to turn\nupon each other in a ritualised\nbloodbath, could we finally have the\nYA novel for the post-Columbine\ngeneration?\nWhile such an interpretation\nis interesting, it seems a bit\noverwrought. The natural tendency\nfor adolescents to rebel against\nauthority needs no explanation, so\ndeeply is it carved into the bedrock\nof our collective culture. But there\nis something to be said about the\nnew direction YA fiction and film\nhas taken, and I personally see it\ndifferentlytoMorrisonandO\u2019Hehir.\nThat is, as the global recession has\nworsened (leading to massive cuts\nto the welfare state) the paradigm\nshift we desperately need has not\noccurred. Instead, what we have\nis a doubling down of Thatcherite\npolicies, and an emphasis on\nindividual action that comes directly\nfrom central government. Why is it\na surprise that teenagers are lapping\nup narratives about how they have\nto rise above and defeat their peers\nwhen individualism is the order\nof the day and we are all in direct\ncompetition for the state\u2019s limited\nresources?\nWe are currently less than a\nyear into a Conservative-majority\nparliament, and since Cameron\ncame to power in 2010, youth\nservices have been decimated:\nraised tuition fees mean the\naverage student will leave university\n\u00a345,000 in debt. A refusal to build\nsocial housing has led to a property\nbubble where the average London\nhouse is 13 times the median salary.\nNHS mental health services for\nyoung people, already stretched to\ntheir limit, have been cut by \u00a335\nmillion. The result: an environment\nfor young people that is not\ndissimilar to a Hobbesian state of\nnature \u2013 one where life is solitary,\npoor, nasty, brutish, and short. The\ngovernment tells us that under-25s\ndon\u2019t deserve the living wage since\nthey are \u2018not as productive\u2019 and all\nthe while stripping 18-21 year-olds of housing benefits despite the\nfact that 49% of people living in\nhomeless accommodation are aged\n16-24. Not only that, but a recent\nreport indicates that young people\nare most likely to volunteer their\ntime to serve their local community\nwith the under 25s spending twice\nas much time as the 55+ acting as\nvolunteers.\nWe live in a world where the\nbaby boomer generation holds a\nmajority of the power.Young people\nhold up this system by offering\nunpaid labour, be it in the form of\ncharity or internships, and are made\ncompletely dependent on those\nat the top.

His continuing tete-a-tete with junior doctors has split\nthe population, either outraged at\ncurrent youth salaries, or in disbelief\nover the strain cuts could have on\nour NHS.\nWith 98% of balloted Junior\nDoctors supporting strike action,\nthey are adamant that this is\na disagreement that concerns\nrespect, trust and the quality of\nthe NHS, not a demand for a pay\nrise. Hunt\u2019s claims about the drop-off in weekend care experienced\nby patients have been strongly\nrefuted by NHS staff from all\nbackgrounds. Some statisticians\nare seriously questioning his use of\ndata presented to parliament which\nallegedly supports the demand for a\n\u2018seven-day NHS\u2019.\nMr. Hunt is thought to have\ncarefully selected his conclusions via\na study published in 2012,by a team\nfrom University College London.\nInvestigations as to whether there\nwas a difference in risk of death\nbetween those admitted to hospital\nat the weekend than a weekday,\nconcluded that admission at the\nweekend was indeed associated with\nan increased death risk within 30\ndays of admission. However, what\nMr Hunt forgot to mention, was\nthat the overall likelihood of death\nactually occurring on a weekend was\nless than on a weekday.\nNew research conducted by\nProfessor Paul Aylin and his team\nat Imperial College London, has\njust added an additional layer to the\n\u2018weekend effect\u2019 debate. The paper\npublished by the British Medical\nJournal analysed over 1.3 million\nbirths in NHS services in England\nbetween April 2010 and March\n2012. Imperial scientists found that\nbirths occurring at the weekend had\na higher risk of complications than\nthose occurring during the week.\nWhen using the comparison of\nper thousand babies delivered, the\nrate of perinatal death (stillborn or\ndeath within seven days of birth)\non weekdays was 6.5 per thousand\nbabies delivered whereas the rate\nof babies dying across the weekend\nwas 7.1.\n\u201cIn our paper we tried to account\nforthefactthatdifferencesinratesof\ncomplications on different days may\nbe due to chance, or that births on\ncertain days are more complicated\nin some way,\u201d said Professor Aylin\na senior academic from Imperial\u2019s\nSchool of Public Health. \u201cHowever,\nevenaftermakingtheseadjustments,\nwe found the rates of complications\nvary on different days.\u201d\nIn fact, Tuesday was the day with\nthe lowest rate of stillbirths. So as\nwell as Tuesday\u2019s child being \u2018full\nof grace,\u2019 do they also ensure a\nhassle-free delivery? I\u2019m sure Hunt\nwould jump to that conclusion.\nSpeculating far enough, you could\nsay these findings support his\nplans, those same plans which some\nportray as an attempt to \u2018destroy\u2019the\nNHS as we currently know it.\nBefore Mr Hunt rejoices too much\nhowever,the second part of the study\ninvestigated whether there was a\nlink between birth complications\nand the recommended consultant\nstaffing levels in labour wards: no\nassociation was found between\nconsultant staffing levels and\ncomplications such as perinatal\ndeath or injuries to the baby during\nbirth.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what causes this\ndifference, and when we looked at\nconsultant staffing levels we didn\u2019t\nsee a strong link between reduced\nstaffing and complications,\u201d said\nAylin.\u201cMore work needs to be done\nto better understand the causes of\nthese differences, so that steps can\nbe taken to improve outcomes for\nmothers and babies. Maternity care\ninvolves a whole team including\nmidwives and other medical staff,\nso one avenue for future research\nmight be to look at staffing levels\nbeyond consultants.\u201d\nWhen asked about the possible\nJeremy is suprised to hear that doctors are humans too and deserve weekends.

However, this\nis a study based on administrative\ndata and so we did not observe the\nquality of care directly.\u201d\nClearly a statement about patient\ncare cannot be created from these\nfindings if the care of women and\nbabies was in no way monitored.\nSo, whilst this is interesting data it\nis important to remember that this\nis an observational study; we should\nnot draw conclusions in the same\nway Jeremy Hunt did after the 2012\nreport on the adult mortality rate.\nThus, speculation should be kept\nout of the political arena. Until\nfurther investigations are completed,\nwe can still presume that \u2018the child\nthat is born on the Sabbath day\u2019can\nstill be expected to be \u2018bonny and\nblithe, and good and gay\u2019.\nLook at that baby all alive and well. Probably born on a Tuesday.

Insufficient space in\nThe Great Hall led to a ballot where\nspecific members of the Imperial\nfaculty and student body were\nadmitted, leaving those fortunate\nenough to get tickets eagerly waiting\nto see the legend that is Professor\nStephen Hawking. Unfortunately\nthough, due to illness he was a no-show.\nHowever this small hurdle didn\u2019t\nseem to greatly affect excitement\nsurrounding the event. \u201cWe\nwere all extremely excited about\nmeeting Stephen Hawking to\ntalk about general relativity in\nperson, but we\u2019re equally excited\nto hear from his students who\nare now famous professors at\nimperial. The knowledge will still\nbe communicated\u201d said Dr. Ling\nChi, executive officer to the Vice\nPresident for Development and\nInnovation.Similar sentiments were\nechoed from other eager attendees.\nAs usual the Provost, Professor\nJames Stirling, started the\ncelebration with a \u2018short\u2019 speech,\nintroducing the night\u2019s speakers and\nproviding the necessary background\nneeded to fully appreciate the\n100 years that have passed since\nEinstein published his theory of\ngeneral relativity.\nHe further expressed his\ndisappointment in Stephen\nHawking not being able to attend,\nbut stressed his concern for the\ntheoretical physicist\u2019s health, before\nwishing him a swift recovery\n\u201cOf course we hoped that\nProfessor Stephen Hawking would\nbe here to deliver a presentation this\nevening, and we were all saddened\nto learn that Stephen has been\nunwell recently and is unable to be\nhere with us today. So, on behalf\nof everyone at Imperial College, I\nwould like to wish Stephen a very\nfull and speedy recovery.\u201d\nLef Apostolakis & Natasha\nKhaleeq\nScience Editor &\nWriter\nI know you\nwill be in\nvery good\nhands with\nstudents\nwho trained\nin my\nrelativity\ngroup\nBefore handing the stage over to\nthe speakers,he treated the audience\nto a recorded message by Professor\nHawking.\n\u201cI am very sorry that I cannot\nbe here with you to celebrate 100\nyears of Einstein\u2019s theory of general\nrelativity. Albert Einstein was the\ngreatest physicist of the 20th\nCentury\nand his discoveries revolutionised\nour understanding of the world\nand our place in it. Although I\ncannot be there I know you will be\nin very good hands with students\nwho trained in my relativity group,\nProfessor Fay Dowker and Professor\nJerome Gauntlett. The theoretical\nphysics group at Imperial College\nhas a great tradition in carrying out\nresearch in fundamental physics\nsince its founding in by Abdus\nSalam and I look forward to visiting\non another occasion.\u201d\nProfessor Fay Dowker kickstarted\nthe talks with an interactive\npresentation titled \u2018Inner Space,\nOuter Space: A Meditation on\nGeneral Relativity\u2019. The talk\nstarted with an overview of our\nunderstanding of the world and\nhow it changed with the discovery\nof gravity by Sir Isaac Newton.\nNewtonian gravity claims that\nbetween every two objects in the\nuniverse there is a very precise\nforce of attraction, proportional\nto the masses of the two objects\nand inversely proportional to their\ndistance. The theory was very\nsuccessful but also had major critics,\nincluding Isaac Newton himself.\nThe main criticism was \u2018action\nat a distance\u2019. To understand the\nconundrum imagine what would\nhappen if the sun suddenly jumped\nsomewhere else. According to\nNewtonian gravity,the force the sun\nexerted on the Earth would similarly\ninstantaneously change and the\nearth\u2019s orbit would instantaneously\nchange. This instantaneous shift\nviolates the universe\u2019s speed limit.\nThe speed of light.\nThis contradiction was a major\nthorn in theoretical physics for over\n200 years, and Einstein himself\nstruggled with it for ten years\nbefore coming up with the theory of\ngeneral relativity in 1915, unifying\nspace and time. Professor Dowker\ntried to demonstrate the thought\nprocess behind general relativity by\ngetting the audience to participate\nin an experiment where we noted\nthat it was in fact our chairs pushing\nus up, rather than gravity that was\npulling us down. The lecture was\nhumorous,interactive and extremely\ninformative, and touched on\ninteresting philosophical questions\nsuch as the dichotomy of \u2018being\u2019\nversus \u2018becoming\u2019 and the potential\nexistence of a block universe, where\ntime and space exist in a block and\nit\u2019s our experience that is limited to\nonly being able to access one part of\nthe block at a time, so to speak.\nFollowing Professor Dowker,\nProfessor Jerome Gauntlett took\nthe stage giving the audience a\nmore traditional lecture around his\nresearch and our quest of unifying\nthe theory of relativity with\nquantum theory, entitled \u2018Black\nHoles and the Unity of Physics\u2019. He\ntook the audience on a journey to\nthe centre of our universe and the\nsuper massive black hole theorised\nto lie there. Black holes are so, well,\nmassive, containing so much mass\nin so little space, that even light\ncan\u2019t escape their gravitational pull.\nThe point of no return is the event\nhorizon and it is this quality that\nmakes them appear black. This\nability of theirs to suck everything\nmade it particularly surprising when\nProfessor Hawking proposed that\nactually, black holes are rather hot.\nIndeed they emit radiation.\nQuantum particles spontaneously\ncome into existence in pairs all\nthe time (an electron and an antielectron for example), but usually\nthey collide into each other shortly\nafter, annihilating each other in the\nprocess and disappearing back into\nthin air. Yet sometimes one particle\nwill find itself into a black hole\u2019s\nevent horizon, being sucked in and\nproceeding towards a space-time\nsingularity,leaving the other particle\nto roam the universe freely and\nin the process, emitting radiation.\nProfessor Gauntlet continued by\nexplaining the implications of black\nholes being \u2018quite hot\u2019on theoretical\nphysics, going briefly into string\ntheory and outlining some hopes\nand aspirations for the future of the\nfield.\nThe night concluded with a Q&A\nsession where the audience was\ngiven the chance to geek out and\ntake all their existential angst out on\nthe two speakers.\nOverall the event was a beautiful\ncelebration of our achievements\nas human beings and even though\nHawking was a no-show, the talks\ngenerously provided by the two\nprofessors on such short notice gave\nus a taste of cutting edge physics\nwhile filling our eyes with stars and\nthe occasional black hole.\nProfessor Gauntlett talking about black holes.

Photo Credit: Warner Brothers\nI\nn a speech last Friday at\nImperial, shadow chancellor\nJohn McDonnell outlined\nhis ideas on a new form\nof socialism where \u201ctechnology\nliberates rather than traps.\u201d With\nfull automation in the not-too-distant-future almost inevitable, it\u2019s\nnow time we start thinking about\nhow Britain will adapt to a post-work society. McDonnell\u2019s speech\nrecognised many of the problems\nautomation might introduce, but\noffered few solutions. As a party\nfirmly rooted in the trade union\nmovement, Labour seem woefully\nunprepared for a world with a\nworkforce without work.\nIt\u2019s likely that Imperial students\nand researchers will help bring\nabout the automation revolution,\nwhether through robotics or\nartificial intelligence. It will also be\nImperial alumni who profit from\nthe resulting mass unemployment\n(over the next decade 15 million\njobs are at risk of automation). We\nmight drive \u201cfuture innovation in\nour economy\u201d, but we could also be\nresponsible for the largest shift of\nwealth in history.\nIn the recent past, our university\nhas proven that it is not benevolent.\nWith the College\u2019s insatiable desire\nfor funding, can it be trusted with\nthe future of our society?\nThose who own the robots and\nown the artificial intelligence will\nhave the whole nation under their\ncontrol; Imperial is likely to be\ncomplicit in all of this. From my\nexperience, there is an alarming\nlack of discussion about the ethics\nof our actions. This would be okay\nif our politicians contemplated\nthe consequences of automation,,\nbut few have the foresight.\nUnfortunately, left unregulated, the\ntechnologies we help create could\ncause social upheaval and society\u2019s\nultimate collapse.\nYet I still believe we should\nembrace automation.The possibility\nof a ten hour work week is enough to\nmake it worth it. John McDonnell\ndreams of world \u201cwhere everybody\nhas the ability to develop their\ntalents and enjoyment of life to the\nfull.\u201d This might be possible, but\nonly if we look beyond capitalism.\nThe futurist left have a solution:\nfully automated luxury communism.\nIt begins with the common\nownership of all that is automated,,\nenabling luxury for all. Rather\nthan letting giant corporations\nbe the sole profiteers of scientific\nadvance (which will undoubtedly\nhave been funded in some way by\nthe state), every citizen of Britain\nshould have some share of the\nprofits. We are already automating\nmore of our transport, health care,\nmanufacturing, admin, and retail, \u2013\nthis will only continue.\nTake for example \u00dcber (which\nJohn McDonnell gave brief mention\nof in his speech), a company which\nis seeking to be fully driverless by\n2030. We shouldn\u2019t let a small few\nat the top make vast profits at the\nexpense of everyone else; instead,\na company like \u00dcber should be\npublicly owned or run cooperatively\nby the community.\nIf the state nationalised all\nautomated industries, the\nintroduction of a universal\nbasic income would be possible.\nThe Green Party proposed an\nunconditional basic income of \u00a371 a\nweek in their manifesto (which was\nunfairly ridiculed by the media).\nThis wasn\u2019t proposed in the context\nof a post-capitalist society, but it\u2019s\nstill a good start.\nMany might argue that without\ncompetition no innovation\nwould occur. It\u2019s interesting that\nMcDonnell decided to describe\nhis economic ideas as \u201csocialism,\nbut socialism with an iPad.\u201d Apple\nis the most profitable company in\nthe world and arguably the greatest\nsuccess story of capitalism.However,\nnearly all of the technology that\nmakes up Apple\u2019s iPad and iPhone\nwas originally invented by state\nfunded or state owned organisations.\nWithout the US military, DARPA,\nand CERN it\u2019s unlikely the iPad\nwould exist today. If a state owned\nagency invented and produced this\nsort of technology in the future,\nluxury could be available to all.\nFully automated luxury\ncommunism isn\u2019t a totally new\nidea; it\u2019s the communism of the\npast reapplied in the context of the\n21st\ncentury, taking full advantage\nof technological progress. It\u2019s\na fascinating ideology that\u2019s\ncompletely incompatible with\nLabour ideals. I\u2019m now realising\nthat I might be in the wrong party.\nThe\ntechnologies\nwe create\ncould cause\nsocial\nupheaval\nand\nsociety\u2019s\nultimate\ncollapse\nSocialism,\nbut\nsocialism\nwith an\niPad\nFilibuster foils first aid \u2013 fair?\nJack Steadman\nWriter\nL\nast Friday, a group of\nConservative MPs killed a\nbill intended to make first\naid training compulsory\nin state-run secondary schools by\n\u201ctalking it to death.\u201d\nThe thrillingly-named\nCompulsory Emergency First\nAid Education (State-funded\nSecondary Schools) Bill \u2013 which\ntells you everything you need to\nknow about the bill in one snappy\ntitle \u2013 would have effectively added\nfirst aid training to the national\ncurriculum, especially CPR and the\nuse of defibrillators.\nBecause it was a Private Member\u2019s\nBill, put forth by Labour MP Teresa\nPearce, there was only a limited\namount of time available for debate,\nwhich was apparently invitation for\na collection of miserable, common-sense-hating MPs to spend the\nTeaching children first aid could be a game changer.

I mean, seriously, take this\nsteaming pile of premium manure\n(courtesy of the Independent) from\nPhilip Davies MP, who appears to\nbe the Member of Parliament with\nresponsibilities for Being a Giant\nAss-Wipe:\n\u201cAmong reasons he listed for\nblocking the bill was that himself\nhad been taught first aid in\nschool but had forgotten what\nhe was taught. He also said the\nGovernment should not expect\nteachers to assume a \u201cpseudo-parent\nrole\u201d, and that he did not want\n\u201cthe Government to be sticking\ntheir nose in at every turn trying to\nlecture [teachers] every five minutes\nthat they should be doing this, that,\nand the other\u201d.\u201d\nThe fact that you can\u2019t remember\nyour (non-compulsory) first aid\nlessons from school is not a valid\nreason to deny it to children\nnow. The fact that a Member of\nParliament is a old man with\ndifficulties remembering something\nfrom his childhood should not be a\nreason for depriving children of an\nextremely valuable life skill.\nTeaching first aid isn\u2019t remotely\n\u201cpseudo-parenting.\u201d I have zero\ncomprehension of how this is an\nargument against the bill. Equally,\nI fail to see how adding this to\nthe national curriculum would be\n\u201csticking [one\u2019s] nose in at every\nturn.\u201d It\u2019s a simple and potentially\nlife-saving addition. Michael Gove\ntried far,far worse when he was busy\ndicking about with the curriculum.\nBut let\u2019s leave Philip Davies to his\nopinions. This filibuster (and it very\nmuch is that) was beyond moronic,\nbut it\u2019s provided a flag to an element\nof the democratic process that is\npainfully in need of reform.\nYes, the filibuster exists in other\ngovernments, most notably the US\nSenate, but there it has power and\nmeaning, and acts as an effective\ncheck (amongst many,many others).\nThe UK equivalent is a watered-down, weedy version that fails to act\nas a check on the government in any\nway, shape or form, and is simply a\nmeans to kill off bills unsupported\nby the Government.\nIt\u2019s beyond time for the filibuster\nto be reformed \u2013 it\u2019s not only this\nbill that has been killed off in\nthis manner (or indeed by Philip\nDavies, who has a horrific fondness\nfor this sort of behaviour), and\nunsurprisingly there is now a\npetition for the Government to\nreform the rules on filibustering.\nCreated by Dr Alex Langford, the\npetition currently has just over\n29,000 signatures, meaning the\nGovernment is required to respond.\nIf it hits 100,000, it\u2019ll be considered\nfor debate in Parliament (and if it is,\nno doubt Mr Davies will attempt to\nfilibuster it).\nDr Langford on the petition\u2019s\naims:\u201cLowering the number of MPs\nneeded to win a vote on a motion\nfor closure, or limiting the length\nof speeches in certain sessions,\nwould be options for reform worth\nconsidering.\u201d\nThis is not a demand to remove\nthe filibuster. It can have its uses,\nbut in moderation, not just every\nFriday afternoon, and not by\nsomeone who was taught to do it\nbecause their political mentor \u201cdid it\nfor fun\u201d. Take a look at the petition.\nSign it. It may not sound like much,\nand it\u2019s not going to change the\nworld, but it will make a difference.\nAnd if it means more bills like\nthe Compulsory Emergency First\nAid Education (State-funded\nSecondary Schools) Bill \u2013 as unsexy\nas that name might be \u2013 get passed,\nit will have been so, so worth it.\nConservative\nMPs used\nchildish,\nantiquated\ntactics\n\n"

Photo Credit: Carnivoraforum\nT\nhe lion has long been\nhailed a most majestic\nand fearsome creature.\nRespected by the other\nanimals within its habitat, the lion\nhas a purpose, pride and courage.\nAnd as far back as the time of\nRichard I, the lion has been used\nas England\u2019s national animal for\nall the aforementioned reasons. As\na nation, we supposedly share these\nqualities with the lion, hence the\nmassive statues in Trafalgar Square,\namongst other places, paying\nhomage to our national animal.\nHowever it has been suggested\nrecently that this symbol needs to\nbe updated and replaced. Trafalgar\nsquare should no longer be filled\nwith the famous lions, but instead\nwith giant hedgehogs. Huge, spikey\nhedgehogs which no one is going to\nbe sat on posing for a family picture.\nThis comes after conservative\nMP, Oliver Colvile, suggested the\nHedgehog becomes Britain\u2019s new\nnational symbol in order to boost\npublic awareness of the hedgehogs\ndecline in numbers. In the last ten\nyears alone, their numbers have\ndecreased by almost a third due to\na loss of habitat. Certainly this is\nan issue that needs to be discussed,\nbut whether it hold the gravitas to\nchange our country\u2019s whole identity\nis debatable. And surely there\nmust be better ways of helping the\nhedgehog than putting it on our\npassports and England football\nshirts.\nIdeas such as creating \u2018specialist\nhabitats\u2019 with new housing, and\nmaking holes in garden fences for\nthe hedgehogs mobility would\nmake a huge difference. This\nalongside efforts of wildlife trusts\ncould curb the decline of hedgehogs\nin the UK. Therefore, reducing the\nhedgehog\u2019s chance of extinction\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily have to be done\nby changing the national symbol.\nAnd let\u2019s face it, if every species in\ntrouble were made a national symbol\nwe\u2019d end up with the wildlife chart\nof the UK slapped on a coat of arms.\nBut the other species were perhaps\nnot considered lovable enough to\nmake the cut.\nIn fact one in three species have\nhalved in number over the past half\ncentury. The tiger moth has taken\none of the biggest battering\u2019s with\nnumbers having fallen 95%. Turtle\ndoves have declined by 93% since\n1970, and bats, butterflies, beetles,\nred squirrels and woodpeckers are\njust a few of the hardest hit species.\nMaybe with the hedgehog as a\nnational symbol awareness of the\nperil of all wildlife in the UK would\nbe brought to centre stage. Looking\nat this from a non-conservationist,\neco-unfriendly point of view\nthough, the hedgehog is really\nnot the kind of animal we need\nas a national symbol. Conserving\nhabitats for our diverse wildlife is\nextremely important; but changing\nour national symbol will help\nneither the hedgehog nor Britain\u2019s\ndignity.\nYes,there may be no lions roaming\nthe British countryside,being tossed\nthe occasional steak by passers-by.\nBut at least the lion as a symbol\ndoesn\u2019t make us the laughing stock\nof the world. A hedgehog, on the\nother hand, probably would.\nISIS must be destroyed with air strikes\nThis is a clash between civilisation and barbarism \u2013 and civilisation must triumph\nChristopher Whitehouse\nWriter\nI\nn the wake of Paris, David\nCameron is set to ask the\nHouse of Commons to\nauthorise anti-ISIS strikes in\nSyria. In terms of strategy, this is\ncommon sense. The RAF is already\nstriking ISIS targets in Iraq \u2013 it is\nludicrous to respect a non-existent\nborder that our enemy does not.\nCritics are right that escalation\nof British airstrikes alone will\nnot be decisive. However, like the\nUN Security Council Resolution\npassed unanimously last week, a\nvote to escalate airstrikes would\nbe an important symbol of British\ndetermination, and a small step\ntowards a final victory in the war\nagainst ISIS\nBut the justice of the cause must\nnever be in doubt: ISIS must be\ndestroyed.In my opinion,jihadism is\nideologically very similar to Nazism.\nIt is a utopian mass movement,both\nrevolutionary and reactionary in\nnature. It seeks the overthrow and\nconquest of governments to restore\nthe glory of a lost Empire. It values\nstrength, purity and loyalty to the\nNation above all other virtues. It\ndespises Western liberal democracy\nas corrupting and indulgent. It has\na genocidal hatred of minorities.\nIts \u201cgrievances\u201d are irrational and\nultimately impossible to appease.\nThat\u2019s what they believe, so what\ndo they do? ISIS has attempted\na genocide of the entire Yazidi\npeople, sparing only those girls they\nsexually enslave. They\u2019ve sought the\ndestruction of the Kurds, to punish\nthem for their adoption of liberal\nWestern values. Homosexuals are\nthrown from buildings, \u201cadulterers\u201d\nstoned to death. And as we saw in\nParis, they seek to strike at the very\nheart of the West. Just as Nazism\ncaused the Holocaust and World\nWar II,this barbarity is an inevitable\nconsequence of their hideous\nideology. Thus co-existence is not\njust undesirable but impossible.\nSince the collapse of the Twin\nTowers, much of Western liberal\nopinion has been unable to\nmaintain moral clarity. In Syria\nand Iraq, millions of innocents\nhave been caught between Assad\u2019s\nbarrel bombs on the one hand, and\nthe knives of jihadists on the other.\nHundreds of thousands have died,\nmillions are internally displaced or\nin exile.Given this status quo,where\nboth Assad and ISIS are deliberately\nmaximising the devastation, ruling\nany Western intervention as\nimmoral on the grounds of civilian\ncasualties is the height of absurdity.\nSimilarly, those who complain\nthat Mohammed Emwazi (Jihadi\nJohn), ought to have been tried\nin a British court need to answer\na simple question: how? The\nbutcher of American aid workers\nand Japanese journalists was in\nRaqqa, deep in ISIS territory. The\nchoice was between a drone strike\nand doing nothing. One can only\nconclude that these critics are more\nconcerned with not getting the\nWest\u2019s hands dirty, than any notion\nof justice or protection of innocents.\nMorally, there is a world of\ndifference between the forces of\ntheocracy and democracy. It really\nis black and white. If we are to win\nboth the war on the ground and the\nwar of ideas, we must never lose\nsight of that simple truth.\nIrrational\nand\nultimately\nimpossible\nto appease\n\n"

In fact, I\u2019m one\nof those people who call it one\nof the best Christmas films\nof all time. The issue is that I\nam banned \u2013 as we all should be \u2013\nfrom watching the film until at least\nthe start of December. Until then,\nit looks like we need some other\naction films to fill the void:\n13 Assassins (2010)\nFor the uninitiated, Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike is a lunatic.\nDebuting in 1991, Miike-san has\nnow directed almost 100 films. But\nhe doesn\u2019t direct crap: Audition and\nIchi the Killer are just two classics\nattributable to him.Also unmatched\nin his disturbing and gruesome\ncontent,in Miike\u2019s 13 Assassins alone\nwe see disembodiment, torture,\nseppuku, and child murder, to say\nnothing of the hordes of soldiers\nmurdered by our main samurai cast.\nFor plot, imagine Seven Samurai\nmeets The Magnificent Seven.\nStarship Troopers (1997)\nI don\u2019t think there has ever been\na film as misunderstood as Starship\nTroopers. It\u2019s almost funny watching\npeople praise the film for what it\nisn\u2019t. Behind this seemingly meat-headed war flick is parody and\ncommentary on the level of classics\nlike Dr Strangelove. In this universe\nthe humans are the fascist invaders\n\u2013 they\u2019re basically wearing Nazi\nuniforms for God\u2019s sake. The action\nset pieces are solid, but go into this\nmovie looking for the right things\nand you\u2019ll uncover a hidden depth.\nThe Raid (2011)\nOh God, is The Raid good. I mean\nreally good. Best-action-film-ofall-time good. In all honesty I don\u2019t\nneed a complex argument to explain\nwhy. The film features Iko Uwais,\na real-life Indonesian Pencak Silat\nchampion taking on countless\ndrugged up gang members as he\nand his SWAT team ascend a tower\nblock to reach a drug lord. The\nfighting is flawlessly choreographed\nand brutal, with every scene here\nsurpassing what would be the main\nset piece other action films.\nBEN COLLIER\nIs Tangerine a tipping\npoint for transgender\nrepresentation in\ncinema?\nO\nn 9th\nJune 2014,\nAmerican actor Laverne\nCox became the first\ntransgender person\nto appear on the cover of Time\nmagazine. Statuesque in a deep blue\ndress, Cox\u2019s face, framed by flowing\ntresses, stares deep into the viewer\u2019s\neyes; to her left, the title of the lead\narticle is written \u2013 The Transgender\nTipping Point: America\u2019s Next\nCivil Rights Frontier; it is a direct\nchallenge, a confrontation for those\nwho stand in the way of trans rights.\nAnd out of all who could lead the\ncharge, Cox is an exemplary choice:\nbest known for her portrayal of\ntransgender inmate Sophia Burset\nin the wildly popular Netflix show\nOrange is the New Black, Cox has\nbrought the issue of transgender\nrepresentation to TVs, laptops, and\ntablet screens all over the globe. Her\ncharacter is resilient, sympathetic,\nand \u2013 most importantly \u2013 a well-rounded representation of trans-identity. In a cultural medium that\nprefers to deal in tropes, Cox isn\u2019t\njust adding her view. She\u2019s changing\nthe conversation.\nIt seems Time is correct:\ntransgender rights really are the\nnext frontier, at least in America.\nWith high profile transwomen\nlike Janet Mock and Juliet Jacques\nencouraging transgender people to\ntake control of their own narrative,\nit appears that we are waking up to\ntrans issues.Of course,no discussion\nof the contemporary transgender\nlandscape can be complete without\na mention of Caitlyn Jenner, the\nformer Olympian whose coming\nout earlier this year \u2013 to borrow a\nphrase most associated with her\nstepdaughter \u2013 broke the internet.\nWhether or not you agree with\nJenner\u2019s support for a Republican\nparty that continues to be oblivious\nto trans rights, or believe that\nher narrative detracts from the\nexperiences of low-income trans\nsays \u201cThere\u2019s not just one trans\nstory. There\u2019s not just one trans\nexperience,\u201d and yet in terms of\nmainstream films we seem to be\ngetting the same thing, over and\nover again. The first problem we\ncan identify is that there is a severe\ndearth of films featuring transgender\ncharacters. GLAAD, a US-based\norganisation monitoring LGBT+\nrepresentation in media, regularly\npublishes its Studio Responsibility\nIndex (SRI), which ranks the major\nmotion picture studios in terms of\nrepresentation. In 2013, only two\nfilms released by major studios\nfeatured transgender characters;\nin 2014, major studios released\nno films containing transgender\ncharacters.\nThis lack of representation is\nobviously shocking, but it becomes\neven more of an issue when we\nconsider the wider implications:\n41% of trans people in America\nhave attempted suicide, including\nCox \u2013 \u201cI went to the medicine\ncabinet and got a bottle of pills.And\nswallowed them. And went to sleep,\nhoping not to wake up,\u201d she said\nin Time. One of the major triggers\nfor this behaviour is a feeling of\nextreme isolation \u2013 the idea that\nno-one out there can understand\nwhat you\u2019ve gone through. In light\nof these findings, the necessity of\ntransgender narratives is obvious.\nBut then we have our second\nproblem: many films and TV\nshows that do feature transgender\ncharacters feature them in a\nnegative light. Another GLAAD\nreport, looking into transgender\nrepresentation on TV, found that\nout of transgender characters, 54%\nhad a negative representation,\n40% took on a victim role, and\n21% were portrayed as killers. In\ncontemporary cinema, transgender\npeople often feature as the butt of\na sexual joke, their existence used\nto undermine the masculinity\nand heteronormativity of the \u2013\ninevitably white, male protagonist.\nFilms such as The 40 Year Old Virgin\nand the Hangover series have used\nthis trope, portraying transwomen\nas sexual tricksters, with the\nimplication that transgender\npeople are devious, conniving, and\ninherently undesirable.\nAnother alternative open to\ntransgender characters is that of\nthe psychotic killer. This trope has a\nlong history, from Anthony Perkin\u2019s\ncross-dressing killer in Psycho,\nthrough to the rampaging murderer\nin Sleepaway Camp and Cilian\nMurphy\u2019s character in Peacock, who\nsuffers from dissociative identity\nwomen of colour, it is clear that\ntrans issues are entrenched in the\nlimelight.\nAt least,this is how things seem at\nfirst sight. However, there is a world\nwhere transgender representation\nhas been repeatedly mishandled:\nthe world of cinema. Laverne Cox\ndisorder. As transgender identity is\nassociated with a sense of danger,\nthe audience learns to fear trans\nindividuals, both for their supposed\n\u2018masking\u2019 of their \u2018true sex\u2019, and for\ntheir homicidal tendencies.\nSuch a representation spills out\nfrom the cinemas and TV screens,\nand over to the law courts: \u2018Trans\nPanic\u2019 \u2013 the defence that use of\nexcessive force, leading to assault or\nmurder, is induced through the fear\nof being an object of transgender\nsexual advances \u2013 has now come\ninto the legal lexicon. It was used\nin the case of Gwen Araujo, a\ntransgender teenager who was\nbeaten and strangled to death at the\nage of 17 after her gender identity\nwas revealed; none of the three men\ninvolved were charged with murder.\nCalifornia has since banned the\ndefence, but it is still possible to\nuse it in America\u2019s 49 other states.\nThe grim reality is that transwomen\nhave a one in twelve chance of being\nmurdered in the US, a number\nthat increases to one in eight for\ntranswomen of colour. As long as\ntransgender people are portrayed as\neither sexually deviant, a threat to\nmasculinity, or a murderous force,\nthings are unlikely to change.\nSuch a murder provided the\nmaterial for perhaps the most well-known transgender film Boys Don\u2019t\nCry (1999): in 1993,BrandonTeena,\na transman living in Nebraska,\nwas raped and murdered after his\ngender identity was discovered.\nHilary Swank \u2013 then a little-known\nactor \u2013 played Teena, and earned an\nAcademy Award for her portrayal.\nTender and moving, the film was\ndescribed by critic Roger Ebert as\n\u201cRomeo and Juliet set in a Nebraska\ntrailer park\u201d. The casting of Swank\nwas also generally praised \u2013 since\nTeena had not been taking hormone\nreplacement therapy, and had not\nundergone any surgery, choosing\na female actor was a defendable\nchoice.\nHowever, this is not always the\ncase. In the last couple of years,\nnumerous films have come under\nfire for casting cisgender actors as\ntransgender characters,most notable\nJean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\u2019s 2013 film\nDallas Buyers Club, which centred\naround Ron Woodroof (Matthew\nMcConaughey), a ultra-masc rodeo\ncowboy who contracts HIV. The\ncasting of Jared Leto as Rayon,\na drug-addicted, HIV-positive\ntranswoman met with critical\nacclaim \u2013 he won an Academy\nAward for the portrayal \u2013 but also\nwidespread condemnation from the\ntrans community. The issue stems\naround whether trans characters,\nwho are in such desperately short\nsupply, should be portrayed by non-trans actors.\nAt a February 2014 screening\nLeto was heckled by an audience\nmember \u2013 his reply was that if\nonly trans actors are able to play\ntrans characters, \u201cyou\u2019ve made\nsure people that are gay would\nnever get the opportunity to turn\nthe table, and explore part of that\nart.\u201d It is a similar defence used\nfor whitewashing, the practice of\ntaking parts that historically should\nbe filled with minority actors, and\nusing white actors instead, resulting\nin an ancient Egypt populated by\nCaucasians. But such a defence\nignores the very real challenges\nfaced by trans actors, who often\nonly play trans roles: a survey by the\nScreen Actors Guild found that for\nLGBT+ actors, one third reported\nprejudice from directors, casting\ndirectors, and producers. When\ntransgender actors are denied the\nopportunity to play cisgender roles,\nto deny them the chance to play\ntransgender roles seems unfair.\nIn an interview with the Canadian\nBroadcasting Corporation, Vall\u00e9e\nwas asked if he\u2019s ever considered\nhiring transgender actors for the\npart of Rayon; \u2018never,\u2019 he replied,\nbefore questioning whether\nsuch actors actually existed. Such\ncomments, along with Vall\u00e9e\u2019s use\nof masculine pronouns to describe\nthe character of Rayon all through\npublicity of the film, makes Leto\u2019s\ncasting seem, if not prejudiced, then\nat the very least misinformed.\nFurthermore, the casting of trans\nactors can bring a much greater\nsense of realism to trans parts. As\ncolumnist Paris Lees wrote: \u201cfor\ntruly accurate portrayals of trans\npeople, cast trans actors\u201d. As we\ncan see with the case of Orange is\nthe New Black, Laverne Cox has\nbrought an extra sense of realism to\nthe role that no amount of method\nacting could provide. While Leto\u2019s\nperformance in Dallas Buyer\u2019s Club\nis brilliant, the characterisation\nof Rayon is completely two-dimensional. Steve Friess, writing\nin Time, said that \u201cthere is no\nstereotype about transgender\nwomen that Leto\u2019s concoction does\nnot tap\u201d. Lees writes that \u2018\n\u201cRayon isn\u2019t a person, she\u2019s a\nfunction\u201d, a statement it is difficult\nto disagree with, especially when\nVall\u00e9e stated \u201cI am not aiming for\nthe real thing. I am aiming for an\nexperienced actor who wants to\nportray that thing.\u201d The \u2018thing\u2019 in\nquestion? A transgender character; a\nwoman who has hopes, and dreams,\nand a lived reality like all of us.\nAnd this is why Tangerine,released\ntwo weeks ago,is such an important,\nground-breaking film. Following\ntwo transgender sex workers\nroaming around the hell-hole of\nDowntown LA on Christmas Eve,\nTangerine\u2019s director Sean Baker\ncast two transwomen \u2013 Kitana Kiki\nRodriguez and Mya Taylor \u2013 in the\nlead roles. The film is funny and\nlively, with Rodriguez and Taylor\ndelivering rapid-fire dialogue that\nwould put world-class rappers to\nshame. There are also moments of\nextreme beauty and serenity, such\nas when Taylor\u2019s character gives\nRodriguez\u2019s character her own wig\nfollowing a transphobic attack.\nThe fact that the entire thing was\nshot on an iPhone (and not even\nthe latest model) is not the most\nstartling thing about it; instead it is\nthe extreme reality that Rodriguez\nand Taylor\u2019s performances bring\nto the screen that make us pause\nfor thought. Here are two women\nwho truly understand what the\ncharacters are going through, and\ncarry nuances in their performances\nthat make the idea of ever casting\na non-trans actor as a trans role\nseem completely nonsensical. There\nis a campaign to get Rodriguez\nand Taylor nominated for the\n2016 Academy Awards; modern\nentertainment, the world of cinema,\nand the rights of trans people across\nthe world would be improved if they\nsucceed.\nFRED FYLES\nMya Taylor and Kitana Kiki Rodriguez in the ground-breaking film Tangerine.

Many of\nthese cultures ... have experienced\noppression, cultural genocide and\ndiasporas due to colonialism and\nwestern supremacy, and we need to\nbe mindful of this.\u201d\nScharf attempted to offer a\ncompromise, suggesting changing\nthe name of the program away\nfrom yoga and towards \u201cmindful\nstretching\u201d,claiming that since yoga\nis \u201cnot really what we are doing,\nwe are just stretching\u201d, and name\nchange would not require a material\nchange to the classes content. This\ncompromise was ultimately rejected\nby the Federation, and the classes\nwere discontinued, at which point\nopposition to the move began to\ntake hold in the student community.\nIn response, the Centre issued a\nstatement via Facebook, insisting\nthat \u201cthe classes were not cancelled\u201d,\nJack Steadman\nWriter\nTeacher claims union said \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019 meant the classes would be stopped\nand were instead temporarily\nsuspended to allow for \u201cproper\nconsultation\u201d over the future of the\nservice.\nThis consultation is part of a\nreview of the service, which the\nCentre claim is required as during\nthe \u201ccouple of years\u201d the program\nhas been running it \u201chas never been\nreviewed.\u201d\nIn a comment on the statement,\nthe Facebook account for the Centre\nalso added that \u201cno one attended the\nclasses so that\u2019s why we ended them,\nits [sic] not that hard to understand\npeople, the fact that disabled\npeople are getting harrassed over\nthis is ridiculous\u201d, with no further\ncomment or context available.\nFinally, the Federation itself\nstepped in to provide an update\n(also via Facebook), claiming that\nneither the Federation nor the\nCentre \u201crelease[d] the statements\naround cultural appropriation tothe\nOttawa Sun [which broke the story\noriginally]\u201d, and dismissing the\nquotes on cultural appropriation\nas falsified.

But\nto achieve this you really need to be\nable to produce something shocking\nand offensive; unfortunately for\nNo\u00e9, boring your audience to the\npoint of nausea doesn\u2019t count.\nThe barely-there plot of Love is\nstraightforward: we are introduced\nto Murphy on New Year\u2019s Day,\nhung-over, the warm domesticity of\nhis life (cherubic son feeding him\ncereal, girlfriend teasing him for\ngaining weight) is shattered by his\nnihilistic inner monologue, which\ndeclares that his \u2018life is shit\u2019. He still\npines for his ex-girlfriend, Electra\n(Aomi Muyock), who encouraged\nhim to take part in a threesome with\ntheir 16-year-old neighbour Omi\n(Klara Kristen), this led Murphy\nto cheat on Electra with Omi, who\nsubsequently became pregnant,\nupturning his life and trapping him\nin a bucolic paternalism.\nBut really the plot\u2019s function is\nthe engine that drags us from one\nartful sex scene to another. It is true\nthat No\u00e9 has a sense of style: the\nshots are all well-lit, with excellent\ncinematography from Beno\u00eet Debie\n(so far removed from his work on\nthe lurid Spring Breakers),giving the\nframes a grainy, authentic, film-like\nquality.No\u00e9 takes an unconventional\napproach to the idea of the jump cut,\ninterspersingeachtakewithasecond\nof black screen. This heightens the\nphotographic quality, giving us the\nsense we are travelling backwards\nand forwards through Murphy\u2019s\nmemories, as if on a Kodak carousel.\nUnfortunately, it also means that,\nfrom the 90-minute mark onwards,\nthere are innumerable occasions\nwhere we think the film has\nfinished, the screen switching to\nblack, only to have our hopes cruelly\ndashed \u2013 forget Lars von Trier, No\u00e9\nis cinema\u2019s true sadist. It also brings\nattention to the bloated runtime of\n135 minutes, which possibly comes\nfrom having No\u00e9 act as his own\neditor; removing the blank shots\nin favour of a Godardian approach\nwould have saved the audience about\n15 precious minutes of torture.\nAside from No\u00e9\u2019s style, and the\nexcellent, eclectic soundtrack, pretty\nmuch everything else in the film\nis poor. The script, in particular, is\nclunky, full of aphorisms about love\nand death that are toe-curlingly\nhumiliating. No\u00e9\u2019s decision to\nuse non-professional actors has\ncertainly not paid off, and while we\nmay perhaps admire him for the\ngamble, admiration does not a good\nfilm make.It is difficult to tell where\nthe wooden acting ends and the\nbad dialogue begins, really. Perhaps\nthe actors would have done better\nwith a competent script, or perhaps\nthe script would have been better\nserviced by experienced actors \u2013 we\nwill never know. What is perhaps\nmost unsettling about the screenplay\nis the sheer unfamiliarity of people\nand places: the characters are all\nsupposed to be \u2018real\u2019 people, but I\nhave never, never, met anyone who\nbehaved or spoke in such a contrived\nway; the film provisionally takes\nplace in Paris, except the fact that\neveryone speaks perfect English. It\nadds up to a sense of falsity the film\ncan\u2019t shake off, not even with the\nunsimulated sex scenes.\nAnd onto these scenes: No\u00e9\nwants to bring back the sense of\n\u2018warmness\u2019 he identified in 1970s\nand \u201880s erotica; or, in the words\nof Murphy, one of many characters\nrepresenting the director, wants to\n\u201cmake a movie that truly depicts\nsentimental sexuality\u201d. So, does No\u00e9\nachieve this? Well, let\u2019s take a brief\noverview of the evidence.\nWatching the numerous sex\nscenes,which recur through the film\nlike a persistent case of herpes, here\nare things I thought about during\nthese unwelcome interruptions to\nthe narrative: whether or not I need\nto order new contact lenses, the\nMurphy (Karl Gusman) and Electra (Aomi Muycock) get up close and personal in Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s Love. Photo Credit: Curzon Artificial Eye\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nForget Lars\nvon Trier,\nGaspar No\u00e9\nis cinema\u2019s\ntrue sadist\nIt\u2019s a no for Gaspar No\u00e9\nWooden acting, clunky dialogue, and childish themes mean Love fails to light a fire\ndiscography of Funkadelic, knitting,\nthe soup I had waiting for me at\nhome, Fran Lebowitz, the use of\n\u2018winter\u2019 as a verb. Here are things I\ndid not think about: sex.\nYou see, there is an issue with\nsex scenes in cinema: it\u2019s not that\nthey\u2019re offensive, or shocking, but\nreally that they\u2019re mind-numbingly\nboring. No\u00e9\u2019s scenes, despite their\nmasterful lighting, have such little\nsexual charge it\u2019s like being hit in\nthe face with a carrier bag full of\ndead batteries.\nAbove all, the film is juvenile,\nembarrassingly so. It\u2019s the kind of\nminor work that a director would\nmake at the beginning of their\ncareer, and regard later on with a\nkind of warm,slightly-cringeworthy\naffection.From the couple\u2019s decision\nto name their child Gaspar, to No\u00e9\u2019s\ncameo as an art gallery owner who\nfucks Electra against a wall a couple\nof scenes after being introduced,\nthe entire thing is endlessly self-referential.\nWhat Love really managed to do\nwas make me long to watch other\nfilms\u2013hardlyaringingendorsement.\nThe flaccid erotica on display made\nme long for the summertime\nsensuality of Luca Guadagnino\u2019s\nI Am Love, or the shimmering\nsexual mirage of Alain Guiraudie\u2019s\nStranger by the Lake; the wooden\ndialogue, which comes down on the\naudience with such force it could\nconstitute a deadly weapon, made\nme yearn for the remarkable script\nof Richard Linklater\u2019s Before\u2026\ntrilogy, and the entire experience \u2013\nso nauseating in its pretentiousness,\nin its elevation of style over any\nsimulacra of substance \u2013 made me\nache to get home,put on a miserable\nBritish social realist film, and scrub\nthe entire 135-minute experience\nout of my mind.\nLove\nDir: Gaspar No\u00e9 Script: Gaspar\nNo\u00e9 Starring: Karl Gusman;\nAomi Muycock; Klara Kristin. 135\nminutes.\nG\u00fceros\nDir: Alonso Ruizpalacios Script:\nAlonzo Ruizpalacios; Gibr\u00e1n\nViradi Ram\u00edrez Portela Starring:\nTenoch Huerta; Sebasti\u00e1n Aguirre;\nIlse Salas. 108 minutes.\nI\nreally had no idea what to\nexpect from my first art-house\nfilm, but if they\u2019re all like\nG\u00fceros, then sign me up.\nExistentialist at its heart, the\nwhole film is a joyous and somewhat\nsatirical exploration of what it\nmeans to be young and rebellious.\nIt follows young Tom\u00e1s, his elder\nbrother Frederico, and roommate\nSant\u00f3s, amidst the 1999 student\nprotests as the three restless youths\nsearch Mexico city for a dying folk-rocker.\nWhile the plot may sound\nlacking, it doesn\u2019t really matter;\nwhere the film finds meaning is in\nthe interactions of its characters\nand their viewpoints, not in some\nbuilt up climax and resolution.\nAn extremely fun film, there are\nmoments of black humour that send\nyou reeling, stories told that are left\nunfinished, and hilariously meta\nmoments when the camera asks the\nactors what they think of the film.\nThese combine to produce a film\nthat\u2019s incredibly self aware and\nintelligent in what it wants to show\nyou \u2013 by the end of it you feel like\nHand Gestures\nDir: Francesco Clerici. Script:\nFrancesco Clerici; Martina De\nSantis. 77 minutes.\nA\nmeditative exploration\nof craftsmanship and\nthe passion of artisans,\nHand Gestures takes\na long, slow look at the work of\nFonderia Artistica Battaglia, a\nfoundry located in Milan, that has\nbeen making bronze sculptures for\nthe last century. The technique they\nuse, lost-wax casting, goes back\neven further, to the 4th\nmillennium\nBC. This information, about the\ntechnique and the foundry is shown\nat the beginning of the film, and\nthen for 77 minutes we are left\nalone, with the craftsmen and a\nsculpture.\nWith no soundtrack, other than\nthe occasional strain of a classical\nconcerto coming in from the radio,\nand largely static shots, director\nFrancesco Clerici seems to have\ntaken a leaf out of Frederick\nWiseman\u2019s book \u2013 although it is\ngood that he does not inhabit a\nWiseman-esque approach to time,\nsince there is no way the subject\nwould have been able to stretch to\nmore than the film\u2019s current run\ntime.\nThoughtfully shot throughout,\nthere is the sense that we are being\nadmitted into a sacred space when\nwe enter the foundry, something\nonly heightened by the silence of\nthe craftsmen.\nThroughout, the footage is\ninterspersed with footage from the\n1960s; lost-wax casting is passed\ndown by oral tradition, and \u2013 as\nthe black and white clips show \u2013\nthe only thing to have changed is\nthe approach to health and safety.\nAlthough\u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 the lifesize dog sculpture produced at\nthe end is fucking hideous, Hand\nGestures serves as a powerful visual\nlink to the past.But the line between\npensive and ponderous is a narrow\none, and while Hand Gestures\njust about manages to remain\nentertainingly reflective, it did push\nthis sleep-deprived reviewer to the\nlimit.\nFRED FYLES\nMy Nazi Legacy\nDir: David Evans Script: Philippe\nSands Starring: Philippe Sands;\nNiklas Frank; Horst von W\u00e4chter.\n96 minutes.\nW\nhile children are not\nresponsible for the\nsins of the fathers,\nthere are occasions\nwhere the legacy left behind by our\nforbearers is inescapable. Such is\nthe case in My Nazi Legacy, where\ninternational genocide lawyer\nPhilippe Sands explores the burden\nof history resting on the shoulders\nSteve McQueen: The\nMan & Le Mans\nDir:Gabriel Clarke;John McKenna.\nStarring: Steve McQueen; Chad\nMcQueen; Neile Adams. 112\nminutes.\nF\nor the avid cinephile,\nwhose interest in films\nborders on the obsessive,\nthere is a special passion\nfor the \u2018making-of\u2019 narrative. Steve\nMcQueen: The Man & Le Mans taps\ninto this with a behind-the-scenes\nlook at Le Mans, a 1971 passion\nproject of \u2018King of Cool\u2019 Steve\nMcQueen, based on the legendary\n24 hour motor race. With little in\nterm of plot or dialogue, the film\nwas an unmitigated flop, but still\nholds a special place in motorists\u2019\nhearts for the realism it brought to\nthe screen.\nIndeed, Le Mans is a visual treat\n\u2013 serpentine shots from the cars\nplace the viewer immediately at the\npoint where rubber meets tarmac.\nDirectors Gabriel Clarke and John\nMcKenna got lucky twice in their\ndiscovering of unseen raw footage\nfrom the 1971 film and unheard\naudio of McQueen himself.\nThey approach the challenge of\nrepresenting audio footage well,\npairing it with sparse landscape\nshots that form a counterpoint to\nthe dynamism of Le Mans.\nSeen from our present-age\nviewpoint, McQueen is something\nakin to an extra-terrestrial:\nmarried to a Broadway starlet and\noozing rugged machismo, he is\na slice of nostalgic Americana, a\nthrowback to an age that \u2013 despite\nembedding itself in the public\nconsciousness \u2013 seems impossibly\nremote. McQueen\u2019s obsession with\nrepresenting his passion of racing as\npurely as possible may have crashed\nthrough the film barrier in terms of\ntechnique, but also put many people\nat risk, culminating in British racer\nDavid Piper losing a leg on set.\nAt 102 minutes, the film\u2019s biggest\nissue is that it is too long. Certain\nscenes could have been cut out\ncompletely without no detriment\nto the structure \u2013 most notably\na bizarre segue into the Manson\nFamily murders that adds little to\nthe film other then to its length.\nAs a piece of pure filmmaking,\nSteve McQueen: The Man & Le\nMans is robust, and Clarke and\nMcKenna deliver a film that hums\nwith visual energy. Where it really\nexcels, however, it in building up a\npsychological portrait of McQueen,\nallowing us to peer under the hood\nof an icon, and see the obsessive\nengine beneath.\nFRED FYLES\nyou\u2019ve spoken to the director Alonso\nRuizpalacios himself. That\u2019s what\nthe whole film is: a witty and honest\nconversation about what it was like\nto be the kinds of people depicted.\nThe fun extends to the film\u2019s\ncinematography, and boy does\nRuizpalacios get inventive, playing\naround with image and sound to\nmake you smile. Shot entirely in\nblack and white and in the old\n4:3 aspect ratio, it\u2019s a refreshing\ndeparture from what we expect to\nbe plonked in front of us when we\nhear \u2018film\u2019, and soon enough you\nlearn to trust the director, and enjoy\nthe ride.\nAs an introduction to arthouse movies, G\u00fceros is perfect.\nAn endlessly interesting film, it\nestablishes Alonso Ruizpalacios as\na director to watch. Go see it, and\ncome away with a smile on your\nface.\nTHOMAS CARROLL\nof Niklas Frank and Horst von\nW\u00e4chter, whose fathers were the\nNazi governors of Poland and\nGalicia respectively, responsible for\nsending thousands upon thousands\nto their deaths.\nWhat follows is a deeply personal\ndocumentary \u2013 Sands grandfather,\nwho grew up in Lviv, Ukraine, was\nthe only family member out of 80\nto survive the Holocaust \u2013 that\nshakes up our preconceived black-and-white notions of attitudes to\nthe past. Frank has come to terms\nwith the legacy of his father, and is\ncompletely ready to denounce him\nas an evil man. For von W\u00e4chter,\nhowever, the fall of Nazi Germany\nmeant he \u2018dropped out of normality\u2019,\nand there is a sense that he has never\nreally returned. He refuses to face\nup to his father\u2019s undeniable links\nto the Holocaust, and yet in some\nways he cuts the most sympathetic\nfigure of the film \u2013 a much less\npolished speaker than Frank, there\nis a sense that he is exposing himself\ncompletely to the camera. \u201cI don\u2019t\nwant to be stuck somewhere full of\npain,\u201d he says, and it is difficult for\nus not to see where he is coming\nfrom. As the film progresses, he is\nbrought more and more evidence\nof his father\u2019s deed, but von\nW\u00e4chter remains an immovable\nobject against the irresistible force\nof oppressive history Sands brings\ndown.\nWhile Sands adds an Adam\nCurtis-esque authority to the\ndocumentary, his linking together\nof past and present events is not as\nseamless \u2013 we end the documentary\non a mediation on growing Fascist\nsentiment in the Ukraine that seems\nto sit oddly with the rest of the film.\nNevertheless, My Nazi Legacy is a\nmoving, deeply personal portrait of\nthe scars left by the march of history.\nFRED FYLES\nThree young men head off on an art-house adventure in G\u00fceros.

Home to Europe\u2019s oldest\nliving man, Stanley Lucas, Bude\ninvites tourists to enjoy its scenic\ncoastal pathways and relaxing\nEnglish charm. What windsurfers\nhad in mind, however, was\nsomething far gnarlier. The arrival\nof the first winter Westerlies set a\nblustery backdrop to a windsurfing\nweekend like no other.Alongside 50\nor so university clubs from across the\nUK,Imperial windsurfers joined the\nlakeside antics at the UK\u2019s biggest\nstudent windsurfing festival: Aussie\nKiss,a landmark event hosted by the\nStudent Windsurfing Association\n(SWA).\nAussie Kiss (like a French kiss,\nonly down under) has a long\nlegacy, with 2015 marking its\n14th\nconsecutive year. With an\nappropriately epic theme, \u2018The Age\nof Discovery\u2019, it was organised\nas part of the SWA\u2019s event series\nwhich attracted over 500 students\nto share in a celebration of all\nthings windsurfing. Aussie Kiss has\nbecome a startling achievement of\nuniversity collaboration, harnessing\nthe passion of an entire community,\nwelcoming people not only to a\nsport but also to a family.The power\nof this year\u2019s event was astonishing,\nwith countless opportunities for\neveryone to get involved both on\nand off the water.\nWithin the university ranks,\nstudent instructors piled forth to\nrun classes for all abilities. Taster\nsessions gave beginners the chance\nto try the sport for the first time\nwhilst intermediate and advanced\nclinics focused on cracking new\nmoves including water starts, carve\ngybes, and even the Flaka. The\nevent grew even bigger this year\nand attracted premium sponsors\nincluding Patrik, Sailloft and\nBoardwise. This guaranteed plenty\nof opportunities for surfers to try\ncutting edge equipment for the first\ntime.\nSaturday was a quiet day\nwith changing wind conditions\nat Roadford Lake. Imperial\nwindsurfers made the most of the\nfree sailing with the entire club out\non the water for the majority of\nthe day. An eleven-person paddle\nboard made the perfect light wind\ndistraction and the sun kept shining\nall day.\nNewly crowned start windsurfers\nGemma McNamara, Javier Ash\nand Lucinda Wilkinson faired\nexcellently out on the water in\nblustery afternoon winds. Offshore conditions meant gybes were\navoided but excellent progress\non upwind maneuvers showed\nclear promise for potential race\ncontenders. Elsewhere, more\nadvanced members dived into\nsessions, swapping tips with other\nuniversities and all looked very\ncomfortable blasting around.\nSaturday was rounded off with a DJ\nset from sponsors Red Bull and, in\ntrue SWA tradition, the night was\nmade special by an immense fancy\ndress party with \u2018Fictional Explorer\u2019\ncostumes ranging from Disney\u2019s UP\nto the Wild Thornberrys.\nSunday morning dawned with\ncaravans shaking, trees trembling,\nand the sign of some excellent\nwind for a hard day of competition.\nRepresenting Imperial in the\nfreestyle, Adam Ouzeri showed his\nflair with switch stance sailing and\ncompleting duck gybes and cowboy\nmaneuvers. Part of a strong heat,\nthis was unfortunately not quite\nenough and Adam was eliminated\nin the first round.\nNevertheless, this did not\ndiscourage Adam, who was later\njoined by Joel Russell and Samuel\nCooper for the team race. With\nan excellent starting leg from Sam,\nImperial qualified first in their heat,\nsetting up for a high octane final\nthat saw Imperial out in front for\nthe majority of the race. In the final\nleg, however, strong racing from\nSouthampton and Birmingham\nsaw Imperial pipped to the finish\nand claiming third place. With the\nsun setting on the lake during the\naward presentation, a podium finish\nwas a satisfactory accomplishment,\nbut, more importantly, it does\nleave strong hopes for the next\ncompetition. With the next SWA\nevent \u2018Up The Brum\u2019 just a week\naway (4th-6th\nDecember), it won\u2019t be\nlong until Imperial get to settle the\nscore.\nAussie Kiss was another weekend\nof sheer fun that shows off all the\nfantastic work underway in student\nwindsurfing, enabling a nationwide\nactivity that is active, inclusive and\nprogressive. Imperial are proud to\nbe part of a movement with such\na wide offering to all students. If\nwindsurfing is something you\u2019ve\never liked the look of then it\u2019s never\ntoo late to try something new, and\nwe would love to see you at the next\nSWA event in Birmingham!\nWindsurfing: Aussie Kiss\nCornwall offered a podium position and a weekend away to these surfers\nJoel Russel & Adam Ouzeri\nWriters\nJames Metcalfe enjoying a Saturday Free sail.

Panic seemed to be\npresent within the team after going\ndown three scores to nothing and\nmay have caused some of the poorly\nexecuted assignments from the\noffensive players.\nIn the second quarter, defensive\ngame plans were changed to solely\nman coverage as zone coverage\nproved to be unsuccessful. This was\na major turning point of the match\nas the defensive team prevented\nthe Killer Bees\u2019 offense from\ngaining significant yardage and\neven forced a fumble when Jonas\nSchwenckzennegger teamed up\nwith the linebackers to bring down\nan oncoming running back.\nOffensively, we executed our\nassignments very well and even\ngot two yards within the end zone.\nUnfortunately, due to a mishap with\nthe snap, we were unable to score\non that play. Intermittent errors in\nthe third quarter for the offensive\nteam and penalties for mistakes\nlike false starts meant that we were\nunable to make many significant\nadvancements. The defensive team\nwas solid in the second half and,\ndespite the Killer Bees scoring one\nmore touchdown, many rookies\nstepped up, solidifying the defense.\nSpecial mention goes to Imraj\nSingh Sunner for flying around the\npitch, handing out massive tackles\nto anyone going through the front\nseven. The offensive team had their\nbest quarter yet heading into the\nfourth with the quarterback moving\nthe ball effectively and Papa Noach\nscoring a crucial touchdown and\nconversion that ended the game with\na deeply frustrating score of 8-29.\nMistakes early on unfortunately\ncost us the match.\nThe defensive MVPs for this\nmatch are the D-Line, once again\nfor an outstanding game,preventing\nany successful significant run plays\nfrom the opposing team and Imraj\n\u2018J\u2019aime \u00e0 la folie les filles fran\u00e7aises\u2019\nSingh Sunner, for stepping up and\ncausing a lot of trouble for the Bath\noffense. The offensive MVP goes\nto Sam \u2018Famalam\u2019 Hill for having\nan amazing game and handing out\nsome terrifying cut blocks.\nOverall MVP goes to Papa Noach\nfor his many great plays, especially\na dazzling catch that lead to a\ntouchdown and his recovery from\nan unsuccessful snap during the\nconversion to score two more points\nfor the team. The Ironman award\ngoes to our quarterback Kevin\nKim Kardashian for persisting\nthroughout every play even after\nsome big sacks against him. Finally,\neven though he didn\u2019t get any\nawards, a big mention to Spewy \u2018is\nnever the designated driver/goes\nto a top university/plays American\nfootball/has a friend\u2019 Coidan for\nbashing his #hitstick and almost\nslowing down a Bath player.\nDespite the loss, the Immortals\nlook forward to their next home\ngame against the Hertforshire\nHurricanes this Sunday.

This week\nwe welcome Joe Kinaround,\nthe Vice Provost (Political\nDealings) for a few words on\nour recent visitations from the\npowers that be.\nHello everybody!\nWhat an absolutely smashing\npleasure it is to be writing this\nweek\u2019s Provost Post of the\nWeek. As an avid reader of Blue\nNews \u2013 oh, sorry, it\u2019s Blue3\nnow,\nisn\u2019t it! I really must keep on\ntop of these things! - I\u2019ve been\nlobbying Alice for months to\ngive me a post of my own. And\nafter that little kerfuffle with\nReese Huffle (ahem) last week,\nit has finally fallen to me to\ngive all of you top fellows (and\nfellow-esses!) a few words of\nwisdom that I\u2019ve picked up in\nmy time here.\nAs I\u2019m sure many of you are\naware, my job mostly involves\nliaising with the political powers\n(or political non-powers, in the\ncase of those bloody lefties\nin the Shadow Cabinet) to\nencourage them to come and\nhave a butcher\u2019s at the vital\nwork we do here at Imperial.\nObviously, they always\ncome away feeling extremely\nimpressed at just how world-leading we are (I\u2019d like to think\nwe\u2019ve come to define the term\nin their eyes), but there\u2019s always\nmore we can be doing to make\nsure their visits show us at our\nbest. As such, I\u2019ve got a few\npoints for you all to enact and\nreact to!\n1. No more bloody students.\nGet rid of them.\n2. Seriously, I mean it, stop\nletting students interact with\nour guests. It\u2019s unprofessional.\n3. That\u2019s it.\nHello all,\nWelcome one, welcome all, welcome everybody to another edition\nof Blue3\n, everyone\u2019s favourite newsletter about the wonderful (and\nsometimes wacky!) goings-on of the Faculty Building of Imperial College\nLondon.\nThis week or so we appear to be have been inundated with floods of\nimportant visitors \u2013 a reflection on our world-leading status as a beacon\nof science of prosperity, no doubt! \u2013 which means all of us here in the\nBlue Cube have been somewhat rushed off our feet making all of these\nimportant people feel right at home amongst our gleaming spires and\nivory concrete towers.\nFirst off, we had the lovely boys and girls from the Lancet (subs, can you\nplease check what this is? I\u2019ve never heard of it before) over to give us\nsome more talks about antibiotics and how they should totally work\nor whatever \u2013 a continuation of our themes from last week of Doing\nScience\u2122, taking a strong Stance on Science\u2122 and being a Science\nStronghold\u2122 (with thanks to the lovely Simon the intern for getting that\nlast one trademarked!).\nThen we had a collection of the finest minds in Europe \u2013 the leaders\nof various leading universities across Europe (or LERU \u2013 the League of\nEuropean Research Universities \u2013 if you like acronyms, which I personally\ndon\u2019t) all came together for a cup of tea and a nice chat about Europe and\nhow our current government seems intent on leaving it altogether. As the\nmost world-leading institution amongst many, we were of course chosen\nto host the whole shebang, and host it we did! Guests were treated to a\nlovely tour of our Big Number Crunching Box\u2122, as well as a quick visit to\nthose lovely biologists next door. Great fun!\nAnd finally we had some pinko leftie drop in uninvited to give us a\nsurprisingly effective stand-up comedy set, where he made such corking\njokes as \u201cThe Labour Party will work with business\u201d! We probably won\u2019t be\nallowing him back into the vicinity of any of our campuses, but it was nice\nto have a good laugh nonetheless.\nHave a happy, prosperous, wonderful and collaborative week!\nFormerly \u2018Blue News\u2019\n\n"

Investing \u00a34000 a\nyear for the next five years in making\nour building more welcoming, and\nthe Officer Trustees and staff more\naccessible is just one small part of\nthat investment.\u201d\nFELIX is unaware as to whether\nthese figures include Value Added\nTax.\nThe union\u2019s annual report was\nreleased this week too.Staff numbers\nwere up this year from 52 in 2014\nto 54 this year, although student\nstaff fell from 132 to 126.

However, there has been a\nbuilding scandal in the international\nscientific community around the\nprocess of peer review. The story\nbroke into the mainstream when\nSpringer, one of the world\u2019s largest\nacademic publishers, announced\nthey were retracting 64 articles from\nacross ten of their publications after\ndiscovering faked identities and\nemail addresses were used to pass\nthe peer review standards required\nby the journals.\nThough the 230 papers retracted\nin the last three years for this type\nof fraud are a tiny fraction of the\nthousands of papers published,\nthere is widespread concern about\nthe peer review process. Since the\nmajority of the papers retracted were\nauthored by Chinese academics,\npressure has been mounting on\nChina\u2019s research institutions to take\naction. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t obvious before,\nit is now difficult to deny China\u2019s\nresearch community has serious\nunderlying ethical issues,\u201d says\nBenjamin Shaw, China\u2019s director\nfor the English-language editing\ncompany Edanz, in Beijing.\nChina\u2019s central research agency,\nChina Association for Science and\nTechnology (CAST), is launching\nan investigation of dozens of\nscientists involved in the peer-reviewed scandal that lead to\nmass retractions. Additionally,\nthe Natural Science Foundation\nof China announced that if any\nretracted paper was the basis of\na successful grant application, all\nfunding has to be returned in full.\nregardless of how much of the\nmoney has been spent. There are\nalso calls to increase the sanctions\non the authors discredited by such\ninvestigation, to show how serious\nabuses of the system are taken. The\nCommittee of Publication Ethics\n(COPE), suggested the problem\nalso has to be tackled internationally\nby increasing the stringency of\npublication practices in order to\nreverse the tide of manipulating\npublishing practices.\nThe problem is compounded\nby the fact that responsibility for\nrigged and ghostwritten reviews is\ndifficult to place at a single person\u2019s\ndoor. \u201cSome researchers may have\ninnocently become implicated in\nattempts to manipulate the peer\nreview process by disreputable\nservices,\u201d said Elizabeth Moylan,\nsenior editor for research integrity\nat BioMed Central. In other cases\nthere is evidence that editors\nsubverted the peer review process\nby recommending articles through\nfake accounts. It\u2019s also important\nto address the root causes that\nlead to peer review fraud, which is\noften the peer or perish culture of\nmodern research. Charlotte Haug,\nthe vice-chair of the Committee\non Publication Ethics blamed the\npressure Chinese researchers are\noften subjected to, saying \u201cWe don\u2019t\nthink that Chinese researchers are\nany worse than anybody else. But\nMadeleine Webb\nWriter\nChina declares war on peer review fraud\nGhostwriters and superstitions arise in the scientific community\nwhat we know is that the pressure\nto publish \u2013 for example in Western\njournals \u2013 is enormous in China\u201d.\nHowever, as long as academic\nsuccess continues to be measured\nby publication in a select number of\nelite journals it\u2019s difficult to imagine\nhow the pressure which drives\nresearchers to such measure will\nend, even if when it\u2019s detrimental to\nthe wider scientific dialogue.\nIs the COP 21 our final chance for action?\nWorld leaders are coming together in Paris next week in what some see humanity\u2019s\nast chance to take coordinated action\nDaniel Silva\nWriter\nT\nhe 2015 United Nations\nClimate Change\nConference also known\nas the COP 21 is taking\nplace next week in Paris. From 30th\nNovember to 12th\nDecember, this\nwill be the single biggest gathering\nin history of world leaders with the\nsole purpose of agreeing on a legally\nbinding and universal agreement\nthat will prevent the world\u2019s\ntemperature from increasing over\ntwo degrees centigrade from pre-industrial levels.\nAfter the disappointments of the\nlast climate change conferences\nat Copenhagen and Doha, many\nestimate that this will be our last\nchance to avert the catastrophe\npredicted by scientists if we fail to\nsubstantially reduce greenhouse\nemissions over the coming decades.\nThis agreement must determine the\nnecessary strategy in which different\nmechanisms and policies set the\nincentives that allow countries to\nmove away from from fossil fuels\nand into new forms of clean energy\nproduction.\nThe severity of the manmade caused situation has been\nconsistently explained over and\nover by climate scientists as the\nsingle most important issue facing\nhumanity this century, yet we\nhave failed to take the required\naction to tackle this over a number\nof constrains. The institutional\nstickiness of a polluting system,\nembedded special interests from\ncertain companies, short-termism\non behalf of our politicians and\na tragedy-of-the-commons like\nsituation where countries have been\nfree riding on the current state of\naffairs are all reasons why we haven\u2019t\nacted with the urgency required.The\ntime to act is now!\nIn an effort to pressure\ngovernments to take serious action\non climate change, civil society\nis mobilizing with marches in\nhundreds of cities around the world\nover the weekend.\nIn London the march will take\nplace on Sunday 29th\nNovember,\nforming around 12 noon from\nvarious places and working its way\ntoward Parliament until around\n3pm.

Photo Credit: Quartz\nI\nn 1853, the architect GeorgesEug\u00e8ne Haussmann was\ntasked with the renovation\nof Paris, a city crippled by\novercrowding and disease. Part of\nhis work involved creating large,\nstraight boulevards that critics\nat the time said were to allow the\narmy to manoeuvre more easily\nand to suppress armed uprisings.\nWhether that really was the\nmotivation behind them, today we\nare regrettably seeing soldiers lining\nthese boulevards.\nThe response to the attacks in\nParis has been substantial to say\nthe least. The day after the attacks,\nFrance mobilised 115,000 soldiers\nacross the country, while 1,000 extra\nsoldiers have been stationed in Paris\nitself. Closer to home, we have seen\nDavid Cameron pledge \u00a33 billion\nfor anti-terrorism units, the first\nincrease in military spending in\ndecades.\nI was relatively unaffected by\nall this until recently, when my\nhometown of Brussels was locked\ndown due to an \u201cimminent threat\u201d.\nI had been told how surreal the\nsituation was, but it didn\u2019t quite\nhit home until I saw pictures of\nthe desolate city centre, thoroughly\nempty apart from a handful of\nsoldiers patrolling here and there.\nThe fear that all this has caused\nis hard to exaggerate, and it\u2019s\nunderstandable. Terrorist attacks\nare frightening because they are so\nunpredictable, and have little care\nfor who their victims are.They fill us\nwith a sense of powerlessness as we\nthink to ourselves, \u201cthat could have\nbeen me\u201d.\nThis shouldn\u2019t divert us from\nthe fact that these attacks capture\nour attention so much because\nthey are freak events. We all know\nthis deep down, but what may be\nsurprising is just how uncommon\nthese events are. 32,658 people were\nkilled in terrorist attacks in 2014,\nbut only a small fraction of these\nwere Westerners. Of all the terrorist\nattacks that have been committed\naround the world since 2001, only\n0.5% of these have been in the\nWest (that figure goes up to 2.6%\nif you include 9/11). Sensationalism\nis sadly the bread and butter of\nmodern news, and we ignore this at\nour peril.\nThese\nattacks\ncapture our\nattention\nso much\nbecause\nthey are\nfreak events\nAll the news coverage and\nheightening of security creates an\nunwarranted atmosphere of fear,\nbut that is not the only harm that\nthese measures do.The obsession we\nseem to have with terrorist attacks\ndiverts our attention (and ultimately\ngovernment spending) away from\ncauses that could save more lives\nthan any city-wide lockdown or air\nstrike ever could.Because of this,we\nhave accepted that cuts to police,\neducation and junior doctors\u2019 wages\nare acceptable, while an increase in\nmilitary spending can be proposed\nwithout any seeming contradiction.\nThis winter some 20,000 will die\nfrom lack of proper heating, but\nwe will not see any proposals to\nprevent this because this happens\nyear on year and it\u2019s simply not news\nanymore.\nThere is also the question of\nwhether heightening security and\nproposing air strikes in foreign\ncountries (as David Cameron did\nquite recently) does anything to\nhelp with the \u2018War on Terror\u2019.\nThis is a hard question to answer.\nHowever, what is certain is that\nthese measures do more to promote\nfear in Western populations than\nthey do to prevent the supposed\ncause of that fear.\nThis brings me to what I believe to\nbe the most damaging consequence\nof the scaremongering we have seen\nin the last decade and a half, and\nthat is the use of fear as a way for\ngovernments to pass measures that\nwouldotherwisebeunthinkable.The\nmost prominent of these measures\nhas been the mass surveillance we\nhave seen with GCHQ, justified by\nWilliam Hague in eerily Orwellian\nlanguage: \u201cif you are a law-abiding\ncitizen\u2026 you have nothing to fear\u201d.\nWhile there are other examples\nof successful infringements\non our human rights, what is\nequally worrying are the laws\nthat have been proposed before\nbeing thankfully struck down. In\n2004, the UK government tried\nintroduce indefinite imprisonment\nfor suspected terrorists but this\nwas ruled to be a breach of human\nrights. The right to jury trial is part\nof the UN Declaration for Human\nrights as well as the Magna Carta,\nand to see a government try to\ntake away this right so flippantly is\ndeeply unsettling.\nMore recently, we saw Theresa\nMay propose measures that will\noutlaw \u201cvocal or active opposition\nto fundamental British values\u201d, as\nwell a bill that will pretty much\nlegitimise GCHQ\u2019s activities. This\nis a gross overreaction to what I\nconsider to be a marginal and much\nexaggerated security threat. Not\nonly that, but it opens up the door\nto activities that wouldn\u2019t look out\nof place in a police state, all the\nwhile with our implicit consent.\nWe often talk of our human\nrights as if they were inalienable,\nbut history has shown us that we\nare more easily stripped of these\nthan granted them. While it is hard\nnot to be swept up in the hysteria\nthat follows from terrorist attacks,\nwe would do well to remember\nthis. Above all, we should not be so\neasily led to believe that we have to\nmake a choice between freedom and\nsecurity.\n\n"
