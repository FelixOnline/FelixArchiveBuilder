    "content": "Feature\n11 June 1993 Felix 970\nWhat is this mysterious Union\nrestructuring? Why is it happening\nand more importantly why is every\none getting so anxious about it?\nArmed with nothing more than a tape recorder and the meagre brain\ngod gave me, I took a full frontal\nassault on the slopes of annihilation\nmanagement. Here I found a fairy\ntale a story that began a long, long\ntime ago, in a land not very far\naway.\nOnce upon a time there was a students' union. It was full of\npeople, but unfortunately, the\npeople that ran the students' union\nwere not happy, for they believed\nthat they were isolated from the vast\nmajority of the students. The\nPresident, whose name was Chris,\nsaid 'I will go out to the students\nand there will be focus groups. And\nthus we will know what every\nstudent thinks and this will bring the\nstudents' union to the students'.\nAnd there were focus groups, and\nthey said that the students' union\nwas bad; the focus groups said the\nunion had no identity, no one knew\nhow to use it, and those that did\nwere known as 'hacks'.\nOnce again, Chris, for he was the\nPresident, said, 'Let there be a working party. This working party\nwill decide what to do'. And in the\nmonth of April there was a working\nparty, and there was a solution.\nChris said, T believe this solution\nto be good', and he spoke to the\nunion council and with a forceful\nvoice said 'We must restructure'.\nThus, the council was not happy\nwith this, and there was much\nmuttering and gnashing of teeth.\nOf course, that is where the fairy\ntale ends. Because now I have to tell\nyou how it really is. Imperial\nCollege Students' Union is a fearful\nbeast made up of many committees\nand mysterious rules and\nregulations. The idea of the\nrestructuring is to simplify this and\nthus make it easier for students to\nuse the students' union. Sounds\ngood so far but, the new structure\nis printed on the page opposite, and\nlooks like the family tree of a particularly fertile tomcat.\nTo see the difference you have to\ncompare this to the present\nstructure. A Union General\nMeeting (UGM) at which all\nstudents have a right to vote, has the\nright to control everything the\nstudents' union does. The day to\nday running of the adr n in is t ration of\nthe union is run by Sabbaticals\n(students elected to do a job for a year) and members of permanent\nstaff, who put into action U GM policy. For general representation\nthe more senior officers of the\nUnion gather once a month to form\na body called Council. Underneath\nthis meeting is the general\nmembership of the union.\nSo why change? At present,\ncouncil contains fifty five members.\nThis makes discussion difficult and\noften circular; it is seen as a cumbersome body, but does gather\nthe vast majority of the union\ntogether. As it meets once a month,\nit is slow to respond and can be\nperceived as intimidating to\noutsiders. The other problem is\ncommunications: The mass of\nstudents are blissfully unaware of\nwhat the students' union does. Chris\nDavidson, the Union President\nbelieves that a clear power\nstructure, explaining who does\nwhat, will allow the student body\nto make better use of the union. Last\nNovember, Chris initiated a process\nto reform the present organisation;\nthe fruit of his labours is the\nopposite.\nOK then, what does this huge\nlump of lines actually mean?\nFirstly, every one is responsible to\naUG M, as this is a legal\nrequirement. But now the week to\nweek mn ning of the union will be\nperformed by a new executive. To\nput it formally, this feature on the\nunion restructuring will have the\nexecutive powers of aUG M. Or,\nin English, it is allowed to interpret\nU GM says and act on that. The\nExecutive will be members who\neach represent aspects of the union;\nthe details are fairly self-explanatory, and on the diagram\nopposite. The controversial nature\nof this body is that it will combine\nand replace the role of Sabbaticals\nand Council, and will only be\nanswerable to aUG M. The second way of increasing the\nclarity of the structure is to give\n'empowerment' to the positions on\nthe Executive. Empowerment is a concept given to job descriptions so\nthat the people employed to do a job, will feel they are doing the best\nthey can. It means that when you\nwrite a job description you give\nsomeone as much responsibility as\npossible and allow someone to\ndevelop the job they do in a way\nthey see fit. This means the job\ndescription of the new Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies)\ncould look like: Responsible for all\nthe Clubs and Societies at Imperial.\nWhat is strange is that the broad\nprinciples of this plan have struck\na chord of agreement in the union.\nEven the staunchest critics of the\nunion agree that council is far too\nbig and holds up debate. Steve\nNewhouse, Social Clubs Committee\nChairman, who represents all the\nclubs and societies in SCC, admits\nthat council needs to change. Rachel\nMountford, RAG Chair, holds that\nreducing the size of council is a good idea. Andy Kerr, Ents Chair,\nalso broadly agrees with the\nnecessity of altering the present\nsituation. But, this is where all\nconsensus ends.\nThe new structure is more\nbusinesslike, streamlined and\nefficient. Unfortunately, a students'\nunion is not just a business. Andy\nKerr expressed concern that in an\nexternal organisation, members\nhave time to study the areas that\nthey were responsible for, and that\nstudents should be studying while\nat University, not filling all their\ntime with students' union activities.\nThis is a call that Chris Davidson\nrejects, he aims for a 'customer\ndriven' organisation, where the\nstudents' union gives what the\nstudents want. Mr Davidson\nbelieves this leaves no room for the\ncushioning that has built up around\nstudent unions in the past twenty\nyears. Worrying about the effect of\nvoluntary membership on unions,\nhe has frequently stated his belief\nthat every penny given to student\norganisations has to justified.\nEven now some posts in the\nUnion are not fd led for next year\nbecause of the amount of work\nrequired. RAG has no chair,\nAthletics Clubs Committee (ACC)\nfound it hard to find a chairman for\nnext year; surely these executive\nposts are going to be almost\nimpossible to fill? Chris Davidson\nadmits that executive positions will\nbe testing, but he commented that\nthe majority of the executive should\nbe able to resolve any disputes in\ntheir own areas without bringing the\nmatter to the executive. A 'grass\nroots' method should reduce the\nexecutive workload Chris\npostulates.\nConcern has also been expressed\nabout the amount of power the\nexecutive would have. With only 15\npeople actually in charge of the\nUnion, the main forum for\ninformed debate removed, the\nexecutive could get away with\nmurder. Naturally enough Chris\nDavidson rejects this: 'Council\nrequested that we hold UGMs once\na month', giving them the chance\nPage 10\nFelix 970\n'eat ure11 June 1993\n*\u2022>\ncarr lIJ TO\nj \u2014 7 0 CJS> 7 0\nCO Restructure!\nWhat is the mystery behind this Union\nstructure lark? Jonty Beavantries to\nexplain the issues opposite and\noutlines some of the problems below.\nSome areas have been shaded on this diagram. Each marked part\nmeans an area of controversy, these areas could change before the\nfinal decision on restructuring is taken at the Union General Meeting\non Friday 26th June.\nCCU's Constituent College Union are\nto have only one vote on the new\nexecutive. It has not been decided\nhow this will be arranged.\nOne option is to elect aCC U rep separate from Mines, Royal\nCollege of Science and City and\nGuilds and this one person to\nrepresent then all. Another is a rotating post so each CCU would\ntake turns to sit on the executive\nconsulting with each of the other\nUnions before attending the\nexecutive meeting.\nBoth Kate Dalton, C& GU President and Paul Thomas,\nRCSU President have agreed in\nprinciple that only one vote on\ncouncil is enough for the current\nstate of their Unions. Although\nothers involved in the Constituent\nUnions may disagree response has\nbeen muted so far.\nto iron out any difficulties\nremaining. Kate Dalton, City and\nGuilds President, said that most\ndecisions are taken before they\nreach council. As Council meets so\ninfrequently, sabbaticals have to\nmake decisions that they are not\ntotally empowered to. She regards\nthe new executive as a broader input\ninto the day to day management of\nthe union.\nBut has there been enough\nconsultation with the Union\nmembers? Chris Davidson says that\nthose involved in the working party\ngathered about 400 hours of\nopinions on students' perceptions of\nthe union. He also claims that most\nof the students in college have been\naccounted for by talking to\nrepresentative groups and asking\ntheir views. Kate Dalton is not so\nsure. 'There could have been more\nbut we (the working party on the\nUnion structure) wanted to get it\nfinished in the time given'. There\nis a target to get the restructuring\nfinished by the end of the year so\nit would be in place for the new\nsabbaticals. The critics argue that\nthis would be rushing the changes\nthrough.\nBut how can we guarantee that it\nwill work? If the executives do not\ndo their job who is going to stop\nthem? Chris also has his answer to\nthis: Elections would have a much\nhigher profile, introducing real\ncompetition to weed out the less\nable, disciplinary proceeding would\nbe a lot harsher, and with UGMs\nheld every month, it would be easy\nto dismiss a member of the\nexecutive. Incidentally, any\nsabbatical member of the executive\nwould be much harder to dismiss,\nas finding a replacement would be\nnear impossible.\nWill it work? That we will have\nto wait and see, but anyone who is\ninterested, the voting on the final\ndraft of these changes takes place\non Friday 26th June. If you have an\ninterest or an opinion please bring\nit along and voice it there. If you're\nhere next year and it doesn't work\nit will be your fault for not putting\nforward your views.\nMedia\nThe three college media, Felix,\nIC Radio and STOIC demand\nindependence with out\nresponsibility. The Students\nUnion want to cover their own\nbacks if any media is sued for\nliable. The media believe that\nunion responsibility means Union\ncontrol.\nAlthough this is a very old\nEnts/SCAB/RAG\nEach of these clubs look set to\nlose direct representation on the\nnew executive. Hence they are\nbitterly trying to fight for a position of power.\nChris Davidson is set against any\nof them being on the Executive,\nAcademic Council\nThis is designed as a forum for\ndebate for all the academic\nrepresentatives. It is meant to\nhave no power but exist as a place\nto air grievances that the\nAcademic Affairs Officer (AAO)\nshould carry to the executive.\nargument and will continue in\nyears to come. A compromise has\nbeen reached for the moment: the\nstudent media in this diagram is\nnot directly responsible to the new\nexecutive, but have to answer to\na UGM. Hopefully this will satisfy\nboth sides but you will have to\nwait until next year to find out.\nand so the fight goes on. Possible\noptions at the moment are: The\ncurrent diagram with RAG also\nunder the Entertainments Rep or\neach one under the Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies).\nDepartmental Representatives\nand Academic Affairs of the\nConstituent Unions are a little\nunsure and the power and\nsignificance of this body is still\nbeing discussed.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "News\nInfo boom Fees up?\nStudents applying to study at\nUniversity this October are being\ntold they will have no course to go\nto following changes to the funding\nof University degrees.\nAccording to a report in the\nIndependent, students who have\naccepted places to study on Arts\ncourses are being told that the\ncourse no longer exists. The move\nfollows a cut in the fees to Arts\nbased courses by approximately\n\u00a3500 per student.\nThis funding cut means that\nInstitution are having to reduce\nstudent numbers. If a student has\naccepted a place on a course this\ncommits the University to provide\na place If the student achieves the\nrequired ' A' Level grades. A loophole exists in this contract if a whole course ceases, then\nUniversities no longer have to\nprovide the agreed place.\nOne possible result of this move\nis a serious reduction in the number\nof 'holding places' for students who\ndo not achieve required grades. The\nIndependent article claimed that\nplaces on Arts courses this year\ncould be scarce.\nNew proposals could mean that\ngraduates will have to pay extra tax\non their post-University incomes.\nThe shortage of cash in the\nUniversity system has sent the\nGoverment and Vice Chancellors\nsearching for new ways to fund\nHigher Education in Britain. Over\nthe weekend it was revealed that the\nLondon School of Economics was\nconsidering a tuition charge on its\nstudents.\nConcern is growing over the future\nof Gardens Halls as a student\nresidence.\nLast year the Princes Gardens Hall\ncaused concern among surveyors\nfrom the London borough of\nWestminster. Fire safety in the\nHall, which can house up to fifty\nstudents, was considered by local\ngovernment officials to be\ninadequate, and in need of repair.\nDelays have been made in\nimplementing the alterations, but\npressure is mounting to have the\nimprovements completed before the\nstart of the new term.\nIt is believed that to make the\nchanges the Hall would have to be\nclosed for some time. Holbein\nHouse in Everlyn Gardens\nunderwent a similar change last\nBoth Government and Vice\nChancellors believe that an extra\ntuition fee would represent a tax on\nthe middle class, something both\ngroups want to avoid. It is\nsuggested that the an extra tax\nwould avoid controversy move of\nlevying students. A similar scheme\nexist in AustrahVwhere graduates\npay a2% more tax after they start\nearning over \u00a313,000.\nyear and stayed closed for six\nmonths, before being opened to\nstudents in the middle of the Spring\nterm this year.\nIf Garden Hall did close it is\nunsure what role the residence\nwould play in the College\naccommodation master plan upon\nreopening. Re apps are students\nwho spend an extra year in Halls.\nDr Simon Walker, warden of\nWeeks and Garden Halls said when\nphoned by Felix: 'I believe the\nEstates division think the Hall is\ninappropriate for use as a Hall of\nResidence', Dr Walker would not\ndrawn further. An announcement\non the future of Gardens is expected\nbefore College closes for the\nsummer vacation.\nFelix Bound\nEditions\nOne whole year of Felix\nbound in a thick black\ncover for the bargain\nprice of \u00a332.50.\nCome into the Felix\noffice and ask Jonty\nfor details.\nA revolution in information would\nfollow from the recent Higher\nEducation Charter, claimed Tim\nBoswell the Higher Education\nMinister.\nThe Higher Education Charter\nwas released last month and sets out\nbroad outline of what students can\nexpect when they come to\nUniversity. Mr Boswell announced\nthat reports of the performance of\nthe Higher Education institution\nwould have to be published in\nUniversity prospectuses. Mr Boswell stated that the Charter set\nout what the general public could\nexpect for higher education as well\nas students.\nThe present document is a consultation document and will be\ndiscussed by all those concerned\nwith higher education. Results of\nthe consultation on this charter and\nthe further education charter will be\nreleased in the near future.\nThe Higher Education Minister\nwas speaking at the Association of\nUniversity Lecturers and the\nNational Association of Further and\nHigher Education Teachers\nconference held at the Cafe Royal\non London .\nDegrees vanish\nDP Elected\nby Andrew Tseng There has been an appalling turnout\nin the election for the Deputy.\nPresident (Clubs and Societies).\nCharles Leary, the only person\nstanding for the election, staved off\nNew Election by 50 votes. The 82\nvotes secured by Mr Leary total less\nthan 2% of those eligible to vote.\nThis has raised doubts as to whether\nhe has the mandate of the students\nthat he is to represent, Dominic\nWilkinson, Honorary Secretary and\nReturning Officer for the election,\nsaid 'I'm extremely disappointed\nabout the turnout, but I'm glad\nCharlie won. I'm sure that he'll do\na very good job.'\nThe results were announced at\nnine o 'clock on the evening of\nTuesday 7th June in Da Vinci's Bar.\nThe Honorary Secretary (Events)\nmade a rather unusual s peach, which criticised the poor turn out\nand leveled personal abuse at\nanother m coming Sabbatical. David\nGoddard was attacked for not\nturning up to sit on a ballot box\nduring the voting as had been\npreviously arranged with Mr Wilkinson. Mr Wilkinson crit c is ed Mr Goddard for be 'unable to find\nthe Union Building'. This allegation\nwas then leveled at Charles Leary\nas he was not being present at the\nannouncement of the election result.\nAll sabbatical election results are\nsubject to ratification by a Union\nGeneral Meeting (UGM). If Mr Leary is ratified at the next U GM he will become the first Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies).\nThe new post of Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies) has been\nintroduced following reforms of\nImperial College Union (ICU)\nproposed by Chris Davidson, ICU\nPresident. These wide ranging\nreforms are also expected to be\nbrought to the next U GM. The next U GM will take place on\nthe last day of term, Friday 25th June.\nGardens out?\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\n11 June 1993 Felix 970\nSex, squalor and God\nPhillip Henry chats amiably to the eccentrics of Speakers Corner.\nAlthough it's only ten minutes or so\nwalk from the college, how many\nof you have been to the world\nfamous Speakers' Corner? I must\nadmit that I didn't go until fairly\nrecently (the April LSD convention,\nactually) and I'm a third year. The\nloss is all mine, I have to say;\nSpeakers' Corner can be one of the\nmost entertaining places a boring\nSunday afternoon has to offer and\nwhat's more, its all free!\nThe place has a surfeit of\nreligious speakers but these have,\nbroadly speaking, the same\nmessage: we are all evil therefore\nrepent before it is too late.\nHowever, there are others with\nmore varied and interesting\nmessages than this.\nMartin Besseman, a32 year old\n'entrepreneur', is probably the most\nentertaining of those on offer\nmainly because, as he claims, ' My main priority is to entertain people\nthough some people find a message\nin what I say'. You can't miss\nMartin; he dresses like a used car\nsalesman, stands on a step ladder\ntalking about his sexual prowess\nand appears to have attended the\nBasil Fawlty School of Polite Punter\nRapport. For instance, his opening\ngambit goes something like:\n'Good afternoon Ladies and\nGentlemen. My name is Martin\nBesseman and I am the best looking\nspeaker in the park. It is interesting\nto note that all these religious\nnut cases have one thing in common:\nthey're all bloody ugly. Come\ncloser, Ladies and Gentlemen. My voice is not very good today so\neverybody except the Germans take\na step forward. The nearer you are\nto me the nearer you are to heaven.\nI realise why a few of you blok es are hesitant about bringing your\ngirlfriends closer; I represent a threat because of my sexual charm.\nTonight when you make love to\nthem, you are going to be thinking\nabout her but she is going to be\nthinking about me....'\nAnd so on. But why does Martin\ndo it? He is quite frank and readily\nadmits: T enjoy the attention.\nEverybody craves recognition and\nby doing this I get mine. I 've been\ncoming here since I was 16 when\nI came with my girlfriend and tried\nto convince the crowds that, having\nkissed her, she would give birth in\nan hours time; when I was 16 that's how I thought it was done... At the\nmoment I'm going out with a beautiful 16 year old who I met\nhere. She came up to me after one\nof my speeches and said:'You were\nfantastic'.'\nWhen I met Martin I was\nfortunate enough to catch him\nbefore he starts speaking and so was\nable to see how he catches his\ncrowd. 'It's quite easy; I just stand\nup... Some people don't get a crowd because their delivery is no\ngood. You've got to be interesting\nand use the right psychology. There\nis definitely a skill in doing it and\nI think I 've got it.'. Indeed he has;\nfirst he starts by chatting up some\npretty anti pode an girls with T know\nyou're Australian; you look like\nKylie' to which she replies:'Oh,\nthanks.'. Then he introduces\nhimself in a loud voice to nobody\nin particular and within a minute or\nso he has an ever growing crowd\nof at least thirty.\nBy insulting the punters Martin is\nbegging for hecklers and has a few\nretorts up his sleeve for just such\nan occasion. A young, sassy West\nIndian woman had questioned his\nability and had asked when he had\nlast made love to a woman. After\ntelling us how he'd last made love\non a train, he went on:\n'So you see: women are after\nexperiences just like in the film\nIndecent Proposal. It's not your\ntype of film, love y. The Elephant\nMan would be more your type of\nfilm...'\nI was browsing through some of\nthe other debates and came across\nan Arab and a skull-capped Jew\nwho were engaged in a fairly polite\nif impassioned debate.\n'You Jews have always been\npersecuted. You're always being\nkicked out of countries,' said the\nArab.\n\"This is true,' Said the Jew.\n'Because we were always the\nmasters and rulers. Rulers of even\nthe Arabs.'\n'I'm proud of being an Arab, a Semite. You Jews, you are\nAmerican, English, Italian. You are\nno longer Semitic...'\n'I'm as much an Arab as you,'\nsaid the Jew. The argument wasn't going anywhere so I thought I'd come back later. The Jewish-Arabic\ndebate hadn't been solved in the last\ntwenty years, I didn't feel it was\ngoing to be solved this afternoon.\nSpeakers Corner was set up in\n1872 after a particularly unpopular\ngovernment decision had caused\nriots in the area. Having recognised\nthe need for a place for free speech\nthe Government, in typical British\nstyle, imposed some trivial by-laws\nsuch as banning the giving of\ninformation on racing or betting,\nthe distribution of leaflets and\nsinging. Some rules are more\nlogical; one cannot incite to riot or\nswear but despite this a lot of\nspeakers swear profusely when the\nprowling police are out of earshot.\nHowever, at least half the speakers\nare talking about religion and warn\nconstantly against such works of the\ndevil...\nGeorge, a sprightly but rather\ndeaf 83 year old was one such\nreligious speaker who'd been telling\nthe wicked to repent since he was\n16 years old. He claimed that he'd converted to his way of thinking\n'quite a lot of people' including\nBaptist preachers. A dog collared\nvicar told me before he sped off on\nhis cycle, that in seven years he\nhadn't converted anyone, so George\nwas doing rather well. George had\nworked at a Sainsbury meat depot\nfor 40 years and added rather\nmysteriously that he was involved\nwith anything to do with coleslaw.\n'We're all here to please God,' he\nsaid. 'It's not easy but I can tell you,\nit's the best life. Not like those\nhomosexuals over there. All the\nproblems with the world is to do\nwith those sodomites and their\nPage 12\nFelix 970\nFeature\n11 June 1993\n'A mmm\nilk...'\n\"Those sodomites' turned out to\nbe some quite nice people who only\nasked for tolerance, acceptance and\nthe same age of consent as for\nheterosexuals. David, a24 year old\nteacher with a slight Mancunian\naccent, explained that the hecklers\nof the 'Gay and Lesbian' platform\nwere 'extraordinarily ignorant\nindividuals'. We had one guy from\na small village in Lancashire who\ntold us that he wasn't surprised that\ngays weren't accepted; after all\nthey'd only been around for twenty\nyears or so and it took time for it\nto be accepted! He genuinely\nthought it all started with Tom\nRobinson's Glad to be Gay' in the\nseventies.'\nHad he ever had any violent\nhomophobic s? 'Most of our\nhecklers are closet queers who hate\nthemselves for their own\nhomosexuality. A guy called Andy\nhad heckled us for six or seven\nyears and then 'came out' and\nexpected us to be his best friends\nand couldn't understand why we\ndidn't want to know him.\n'Once we had two soldiers\nthrowing cans at us and then\nCharlie, over there,' he indicated a middle aged woman, 'Charlie was\naware after half an hour on the train\nthat she'd been followed by one of\nthe soldiers. He came up and\napologised for the behaviour he'd shown in front of his friend; he was\ngay and was trying to fool his\nmate.'\nSome hecklers didn't suffer from\nsuch regrets. 'One guy threatened\nto impale us on a red hot spike.\nAnother came down with his two\nyear old daughter and his pit bull\nand told us explicitly how he'd like\nto kill us. People like that shouldn't be allowed to become parents.\nImagine the trouble that child will\nhave if she finds, when she grows\nup, she's a lesbian.'\nWas he frightened at all before he\ngot up to speak? 'The first time is\nalways scary but I don't get nervous\nanymore; I know that I don't have\nto do it, I can walk out anytime. At\nschool I was occasionally bullied\nand I knew I had to go back\neveryday. Now THAT' S frightening.'\nAt this point a Christian from an\nadjacent platform shouted to the\ncrowd in a strong Edinburgh\naccent:'It's filthy, foul sex, the\nDevil's sex, Demons' love. It's filthy. Don't stand there, kids, or\nyou'll get a filthy, unclean spirit\ncoming out of those poof ter s into\nyou and you'll start thinking about\nit...'\nI was then introduced to Jon, an\nItalian 30 year old council tax\nworker who'd been over here long\nenough to lose his accent. Jon was\na joint founder of the platform ten\nyears ago. 'We wanted to do\nsomething about the mis education which society feeds us. It's had\nsome success; we get parents who'd come here on holiday two or three\nyears ago and who've then found\nthat their kids are gay and they just\nneed some advice.\n'When I decided to tell my\nparents I told my mum first. She\ngave the typical Italian mother\nresponse and threw all the pots and\npans on the floor then told me to\ngive her five minutes to calm down.\nShe said that I was still her son and\nthough she didn't understand why\nI was gay she'd always love me.\nMy father didn't speak to me for a year; he bought a statue of the\nVirgin and prayed to it to make me\nnormal. It's this kind of thing we're\ntrying to educate people against.'\nOpposite the Gay and Lesbian\nstand there was another David who\nwas 'homeless but I 've been\nhomeless before' and angry that the\nGovernment could spend sixty\nmillion pounds on the restoration of\nWindsor Castle and not thirty\nthousand on the Hostel he'd lived\nin that had to close. 'The problem\nof homelessness is going to get\nworse and worse and worse.'.\nDavid was voicing his complaints\nagainst all the Government and a percentage of the police who are\nintolerant of the homeless. T was\ndown in Knightsbridge and these\ncoppers came up to me and one of\nthem starts kicking me in the back.\nHe said: 'How'd you like me to kick\nyou in the face?' so I punched him\nin the knee and got taken to the\npolice station. Now I know the\nSergeant; he says:'Hello, David,\nhow you doing?' and I explained I'd been kicked by one of his constables\nso he gave him a real mouthful but\nwhen I left the constable told me\n'I'm gonna get you!' so I live up\nhere now.'\nI returned to the Arab-Israeli\ndebate which had become funnier\nto watch but more of a school\nground argument.\n'You are nothing without the\nAmericans. Zero. Nothing. What\nwould you do without them?' asked\nthe Arab.\n'Oh, we'll find some other idiot.\nYou Arabs haven't changed in\ntwenty years of me talking to you.\nBut then, neither have we,' replied\nthe Jew with a shrug. 'You talk like\na primitive Arab. What can I do?'\n'Bastards! That's what you are!'\n'You Arabs are lazy bastards!\nYou are useless people!'\n'You Jews are a shitty race!'\nI managed to talk to the Jew\nafterwards. His name was Joseph\nand he told me he'd been coming\nhere since he was 15 way back in\n1964. I asked did he always talk\nabout the Arab-Israeli dichotomy.\nT try to avoid it like Aids,' he\nanswered. I tried a few other\nquestions but I found the old adage\nis true: Why do Jews always answer\nquestions with a question? Answer:\nWhy shouldn't Jews answer\nquestions with questions? Joseph\nwas hard to pin down but he did tell\nme that 'attitudes are changing.\nThere are too many foreigners, too\nmany wavelengths. It's hard to tune\ninto one in particular.'\nI asked a few tourists what they\nthought of Speakers Corner; They\nwere all entertained and commented\nthat nothing like it existed abroad,\nnot in America, not in Canada, not\nin Turkey, not anywhere else. One\nIndian gentleman stressed that\nalthough India is a democracy and\nalthough such a place could exist\nthere, none does. An American\ncalled London 'the home of free\nspeech'. One can become\ncomplacent quite easily because to\nme visiting Speakers Corner was\njust something to do on an\notherwise boring Sunday.\nPage 13\n\n"

H.L.S( pronounced- nibbles),\nwhich is National Institute for\nBringing History to Life Society.\nThey take you through the lives of\nthe Bronte sisters (Charlotte and\nEmily only, Anne was too\nunimportant) and explain their\nworks.\nBoring? You must be joking.\nThis is a total piss take of the work\nof the Bronte's. Periodically, hints\nand tips are given for GCSE\nstudents which have to be seen to\nappreciate fully and the actresses\nregularly pull revolting faces,\nespecially when the phrase\n'Withering Looks' is said.\nI had two favourite parts of the\nninety minute show. The first was\nwhen Emily Bronte, played by\nAudrey (a member of N.I.B. H.L.S, who was played by Maggie Fox),\ndescribed to her sister Charlotte\n(played by Olivia, who was played\nby Sue Ryding) the story of\nWuthering Heights in five minutes,\nusing eight inch high black and\nBoo\n'It's me, I'm Catheee, I 've come home now.'\nwhite cardboard cut outs and\nhysterical sound effect provided by\nthe actresses. Sounds odd? Again,\nsee it appreciate it.\nThe second memorable point was\nwhen the actresses acted a clip from\nthe 1939 MGM version of\nWuthering Heights, starring\nLawrence Olivier and David Niven.\nNo description, go and see it.\nFinally, if you thought that a piss\ntake of the Bronte's could not go\nwithout a snippet of the number one\nsong by Kate Bush, Wuthering\nHeights, you were wrong. It's in\nthere. Go and see this play to find\nout where.\nHarry\n\u2022 Drill Hall Arts Centre, 16\nChenies St, WC1. Goodge St.\nTube. Tue- Sat 7.30pm. Cones \u00a36.\nEnds June 26th.

I know this\nmay sound a pretty boring and\ndepressing story, but to my surprise\nit wasn't. The book is at the same\ntime sad and funny, well written,\nand does not fall into sickening\nsentimentality (only a touch every\nnow and then, especially at the\nend).\nOf course, if what you want of a book is sex and violence, then this\none is not for you. But otherwise,\nit makes enjoyable reading.\nJ.D. \u2022 Price \u00a35.99, published by\nBlack Swan.\nRecommended\nDanny Boy\nThis is a black comedy about a Northern Irish catholic who gets\nvisited by the Angel Gabriel and\ntold that he is the Son of God.\nThere are many things Jesus U( Danny) has in common with\nJesus\u2014the original version. He\nis a woodwork teacher (almost\na carpenter), he's thirty, and\u2014\nmost convincing\u2014he's got a beard. Oh yes, and his parents\nnames are Mary and Joseph.\nGiven my views on the subject\n(I'm a Christian) I may have\nfound this deeply blasphemous,\ni but due to the fact that many\nChristians have a sense of\nhumour about much of their\nfaith, I found it absolutely\nhysterical. The Church of\nEngland is described as\n'Atheism with Hymns', and an\nOrange Man (Protestant) says\n'Anyone who's been\nexcommunicated can't be all\nbad'.\nThe humour in the play\ncomes from the Christian angle;\ngeneral doctrine, miracles, dead\nbudgies and Catholic/Protestant\ndifferences. There are sobering\ninterludes concerned with the\npolitical aspects of Irish life.\nDanny's mother wants him to\nuse his 'spiritual powers' to\nfight the republican cause, but\nhe just wants 'peace, love and\nunderstanding' along with his\nfirst disciple, his best friend\nDermot, a pacifist Stalinist who\nhe raised from the dead.\nThe play reached its\ninevitable conclusion in a way\nthat wasn't at all tacky and made\nits point very well.\nYou really should go and see\nthis play, its absolutely brilliant.\nSpend some of that money and\ngo and see it.\nFlossie\n\u2022 Etcetera Theatre, Oxford\nArms Pub, 256 Camden High\nRd., NW1, Camden Town\nTube.

If you disagree, that's ok, your prerogative, we're not\nstyle fascists, et cetera. Bet you're\nfeeling pretty stupid now, though.\nOnce past the 'Roddy Frame in\nRock n' Roll pose' cover, we\nencounter the lyrics, and press\n'play'. The tasteful execution of\ndrums, Ryuichi Sakamoto's keyboard y string arrangements, and\nthe like, sort of rises up like a gende\nwash type thing while Roddy wails\n'How sweet to fly, to touch the\nsky', and achieves, not just the most\nstupendous musical moment ever,\nbut. 'Safe in Sorrow' follows,\nspinning us lines like 'Building up\na big brick wall' and 'you will see\nmy love is for free'; de a rie me,\nRoddy, Mr Lyric's well and truly\nabsent, isn't he? And Colonel\nMelody? Well, he seems to have\ndowned a kilo jar of honey for extra\nsweetness, and a gallon of kaolin\nfor his diarrhoea. 'Black Lucia'\nstarts promisingly enough, with a couple of chunks of roughneck\nguitar, but these vanish into\nsaccharine land before you can say\n'Hey, that's pretty good after the\nlast load of old bollocks'. 'Spanish\nHorses' has quite a nice little guitar\nline, reminiscent of John Williams\nat his most flamboyant, but then\n'Dreamland' is just a bit fucking\n'nice' all round.\n'Dream Sweet Dreams' is the\nclosing track on side one, and it's probably the strongest song, in spite\nof Knopfler-esque guitar work circa\n'Making Movies'. The other side\ntakes the structure, takes out the\nbones, and, frankly, takes the piss.\nJesus Christ, this is the sort of mind-free wank you'd expect from Tina\nTurner, and on the strength (sic) of\n'Pianos and Clocks' and 'Sister\nAnn' you'd probably say that\nRoddy's out of the Frame (Oh, har,\nhar, bloody har - sic. Ed). The\nconsensus around here is that Mr Frame has in fact 'lost it'. I mean.\nLives have been ruined for less, and\nThousand Yard\nStare\u2014Mappamundi\n'Hands on', moving on, a murkier\nsecond album from Thousand Yard\nStare not quite so precise, so exact\nas the first; more variety; a deeper,\nmore active album, less...less,\nmore, more.\nAdmittedly the first time I listened to it I was non-plus sed, to\nsay the least. In fact, I think the\nactual word was 'Bollocks!'. But all\nthings take time. 'It's the quiet ones,\nthat kill your friends'. Indeed,\n'Mappamundi', creeps about, and\nnow, oh now, it gives me\ngoosebumps, jumps and lumps.\n'There's been a small change, a time to rearrange', differences, yes,\nbut still pretty much unique,\nrecognisable as Thousand Yard\nStare: See for miles.\nEasi Style!\n\u2022 Out now on Stifled\nAardvark/Polydor.\nit really is time we took these\nunbelievably wealthy charlatans,\nput them against a wall and shot\nthem for disgraceful career is t blandness.

Aztec Camera\nhave already finished their tour. Did\nwe get tickets? Ha. Did we fuck.\nDarlingheart - Serendipity\nFirst and foremost, I'd like to get\nsomething off my chest; a copy of\nthis review will go to NUS Ents,\nand the managers of the Astoria,\nwhere Darlingheart played a support slot to Blur last friday\n(You remember. It was previewed\nin Felix last week - sic. Ed): You\nfucked up. I don't know which of\nyou fucked up, but you fucked up\nnonetheless, and, bureaucracy\naside, your door policy's shit and\nso is the w anker who enforced it\non my reviewer. You may not\nthink it matters that much, but\nour student handbook carries a venue guide, and the competition\nfor the worst venue in London (an\naccolade coveted previously by\nthe Hammersmith Odeon and\nWembley Arena) looks like being\na one- horse race, if you get my\nmeaning. C** ts.\nThis is Darlingheart's debut\nalbum, and much as I'd like to\napologise for our incoherent\nobscura nt is m, we have reviewed\nthem before, as have others.\nThey're from Kirkcaldy, a channing little place not so far from\nEdinburgh where I spent a little of\nmy youth. 'The Flood' opens the\nalbum, a brief, skimpy thing that\nopens up for 'Loaded' 'Smarthead'\net cetera. The heavily under-exploited combination of guitar and\ncello is one Darlingheart have\nemployed to a highly proficient\ndegree; it sounds frequently like the\nMuses gone even folk i er, but\noverall it is a darkness charming its\nway into your head. The sleeve\nnotes, by the way, credit one\nCallum Gilhoully, of 'Absolutely'\nfame (or should that be infamy? -sic. Ed), for harmonica and (get\nthis) 'anorak i um'. There's quotes\nfrom the poet, Stevie Smith, and\n'well-known Geordie sports\ncommentator', Syd Waddell, too.\nAs if that wasn't enough (Actually,\nI could tell you that there's two girls\nin the band, and they're both babes,\nbut I( Shut up, O 'Nonchalant; This\nreview's crap - sic. Ed) wouldn't stoop so low). Fair enough, boss.\nDonny O 'Nonchalant\n\u2022 Out now on Fontana. Darlingheart: Bet you can't do a funny caption for this, you bast a Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "opinion\n11 June 1993 Felix 970\nBelieve the Bosnians\nDear Editor,\nI read an article entitled\n'Refugees' which appeared in Fleix,\nIssue 967.1 felt obliged to give my\nopinion to your magazine which I enjoy reading and respect.\nI trust Felix operates on a freedom-of-speech basis, and\ntherefore I expect and look forward\nto seeing my article published in\nyour forthcoming issue.\nAs a student magazine one may\nfeel reluctant to write articles\nbeyond the academic scope.\nHowever, since the topic is tragic,\nit must concern us all, whether\nstudents or not.\nThe recent waves of refugees sent\nacross Europe were as a result of\nbarbaric crimes and ethnic\ncleansing tactics. The future of\nthese refugees had been under\ndiscussion, behind closed doors, by\npoliticians who for more than a year\nhave failed to stop a crime on an\ninternational scale. Tens of\nthousands of civilians have been\nmissed or killed, and another two\nmillion have been made homeless\nand refugees.\nThese refugees have put trust and\nfaith in the international community\nand the new world order, hoping to\nreturn to their lost land, the\nconcerned politicians have been\ndrawing maps and putting plans.\nUntil now no map has been finalised\nwaiting for the aggressors to finish\ntheir aggression. We have seen\nseveral retreats from representatives\nof the international community in\nfavour of groups of criminals who\ntortured to death civilians in\nconcentration camps and subjected\nmen and women to unspeakable\ncrimes. These refugees are betrayed\nif we realise the hopeless disarray\nof the UN, fee loss of credibility\nand the constant retreats of its peace\nenvoys. These refugees have been\ndenied weapons to defend\nthemselves and have been given\nimaginary promises and false hopes\nof help and support. These refugees\nare now and might always be\ndisplaced from their homes and let\ndown by those who have the saying\nbut hesitant or unable to implement\nit. These refugees are now in\nabsolute misery, cut off in isolated\ncommunities. For my part whether\na Londoner or outsider, I do not see\nit nice at all to find b eggers on the\nstreets, anywhere, whether refugees\nor not. I must say that I feel very\nsad. It is irritating. It is also morally\nhard to ask for help, especially\nwhen the person asking for help\nreally deserves it. These refugees\nshould learn very soon that begging\non the streets will not return their\nhomes. These refugees must learn\nvery soon that even if they make\nfortunes out of begging, these\nfortunes are not theirs as long as\nthey are refugees. The only fortunes\nthey may have are their lost homes\nand hopes; their lost souvenirs,\nidentity and dignity.\nWhat is required now is that: the\nUN should honour its commitments\nand match actions with words if a sort of credibility is to be\nmaintained. Having failed to do so\nfor more than a year, I suspect that\nwill never happen. Of course, I am\ndisappointed. There is one thing left\nto look at. History. It taught us that\nunjust settlements can never be\nsettled but have always been a source of further conflicts. There\nmust be a just and fair settlement.\nThere must be honesty.\nYouseef M Samrout.\nACC\nELECTIONS\nChrist is the lightbulb\nof my life\nDear Jonty,\nFlattering as it is to become a principal character in \"The Amazing\nAdventures of Andrew the Abstract\nEntity', might I enquire whether the\ncartoonist actually read my article?\nMy intention was not to promote\nbelief in God, or as the subtitle read\n'to justify faith in religion' but to\nlevy what I felt to be a valid\ncriticism against institutional is ed religion. I am, by no means,\nconfident enough in my own belief\nto tell others what to believe. I think\nit is crucial that any such belief is\nfounded on personal conviction\u2014\nnot the sort of aggressive\nev angelis ation that is attributed to\nme in the cartoon.\nTo give the cartoonist his (or her)\ndue, the title, subtitle and picture\nmay have misled them. The original\ntitle of the article was 'Religion: A Necessary Evil'. I am partly to\nblame for not having looked for a suitable picture. I had been thinking\nmore of a painting of the Spanish\nInquisition than a photograph of a light bulb wearing a suit.\nThe fact that I do profess myself\nto be a Christian is incidental to the\nargument I was putting forward in\nthe article. I tried to establish how\nreligion, which generally is linked\nto strong ethical and moral codes,\ncould become the source of violence\nand hatred. It is a curious irony that\nI believe modern religious\ninstitutions must avoid.\nNaturally' I respect the need for\neditorial control of media, but\nperhaps this incident serves to point\nout the need for caution when\nmaking changes to submitted\narticles without due care. I look\nforward to featuring in 'The\nAmazing Adventures' again!\nYours sincerely,\nGeoffMaxwell, Elec Eng UG2.\nThe elections for the positions of\nHon Secretary, Assistant Treasurer,\nPublicity Officer and Women's Officer are to take place at one\no 'clock on Friday 18th June in the\nUDH.

    "content": "Unfocused\nDear Jonty,\nI have been following the recent\narticles in Felix concerning Union\nstructure changes. Despite\nconflicting reports that. Council\nhave both agreed and disagreed on\nChris Davidson's proposals it\nappears that students are going to\nget a chance to decide the matter\nonce and for all on Friday 25th June\nat the Union General Meeting. How\ngenerous an offer to be able to\ndecide what we want from our\nUnion. Unfortunately, this would\nappear to be the first voice the\nmajority of students have been\ngiven.\nHow are we supposed to make an\ninformed decision if the only\ninformation generally available is\nthat, often confusing, conflicting\nand probably inaccurate, printed in\nFelix.\nSurely there should have been far\nmore consultation with the general\nstudent populus, particularly those\nless involved in the Union. Within\nmy group of friends (I do know a fair number of students here even\nthough I am not as pod dy Union\nhack) none of those I have asked\nhave even heard of these nine\nmonths of focus groups let alone\ntaken part in them. Surely we are\nthe type of people who should have\nbeen in these groups?\nI can only hope that enough\npeople will turn up to the U GM on\nFriday 25th June in the JCR to press\nChris into fully explaining his new\nproposals and how they affect the\naverage student. On the other hand\nmaybe Chris is hoping everyone\nwould rather go down Southside\nBar on the last day of term so he\ncan avoid potentially embarrassing\nquestions.\nIf you don't stand up, how can\nyou be counted?\nYours sincerely,\nSusan Purdom (ISE 1).\nUninformed\nDear Jonty,\nI see that Union Structure\nWorking party has finally explained\nto members of Imperial College\nUnion the changes that it has\nproposed.\nWell I assume that was the\npurpose of 'Flip Chart Abuse'\n(Felix 969) that was written, as I understand it, by ICU President\nChris Davidson.\nI found the article incoherent and\nincredibly uninformative. ICU Council has spent around six hours\ndiscussing these changes, yet\nnowhere in his article does he\nattempt to explain the changes, why\nthe Union Structure Working party\nhas proposed them, and what effect\nFelix 970\nit will have on the students.\nIf he does not have the time or the\ninformation or the ability to\ncommunicate these ideas to the\npeople who elected him and\nrepresent him, then could he not\nfind someone else in the Union\nStructure Working party who has?\nThere is no point in changing for\nthe sake of change. If we are going\nto re-structure, let's do so after\ninforming the membership of the\nchanges.\nSteven Newhouse, Aero PG.\nUnhappy\nDear Jonty,\nI read with some amusement your\nnews story in Felix 969 entitled\n'Council Farce'. Firstly-I would\nlike to correct the small error, that\nin both cases where you have\nreferred to SCAB you should\nactually have referred to Ents.\nIt is interesting to note that the\nmotion discussed in the article was\nnot the only case where the decision\npassed was actually against the\nwishes of the people who it\naffected.\nEarlier in the evening, I had made\nthe suggestion, that, in all decision,\nthe wishes of the affected parties\nshould be upheld over the wishes of\nthe rest of Council, and Council\nagreed to this. However, this did\nnot happen in practice, as the\nDunkin Doughnuts may ease the\nblow of accepting this dod gy job.'\nNext morning I punch in the\nnumber. (Farewell to the word\ndial). An EastEnder-made-good\nvoice answers. We rap. Apparently\nthe job has something to do with the\nstock market. 'Yeah, that's right,\njust like Capitol City'. Err, yeah,\nand Wall street.

T know it sounds a lot, but\nas the, err, position, only lasts for\none month you'll need those hours\nto achieve any real earning\npotential.' The smell of solvency\nbrings me around.

'No\nhoney, I really think you need an\nimage change for the interview.'\nBut all my wardrobe (read:\nOpinion\n11 June 1993\nCCU's were not happy with the\nC CU Rep, the Clubs and Societies\nwere unhappy with the DP (Clubs\nand Societies) and Rag and Ents\nwere unhappy with the Ents Rep.\nIt would appear that Chris is\ntrying to spread the illusion that the\nmajority of people are satisfied with\nthis report. I quote from his letter\nto Council members: 'It seems\nsensible to discuss the\nEntertainments Rep/DP (Clubs and\nSocieties) after the UFC meeting on\nthe 8th, twenty minutes should bag\nit as consensus has emerged over\nthe last few days.' Yet I know that\nof the eight branches of the Union\nthis affects, at least half are in\ndisagreement with Chris's new\nproposals.\nI am concerned that these\nproposals are based on poor\nresearch and lack of communication\nwith relevant parties. Maybe the\nUnion does need a change, but a poorly thought out change that does\nnot address or solve any of our\ncurrent problems can only be a change for the worse.\nTo quote from Chris's article\n'Flip Chart Abuse' (are you\nashamed to put your name to it?).\n'We'll show that Chris Davidson\nwhat we think of a customer\nfocused Union...'

    "content": "'eat ure11 June 1993 Felix 970\nDoes she take sugar?\nWhat is Imperial doing to help its disabled students, and what can it\ndo without causing offence? Stef Smith investigates.\nIt was all done so very casually. She\nhitched up her summer dress a few\ninches and injected herself in the\nthigh. How can this woman be\ndisabled? She copes with her life as\nthe rest of the populous, faces the\nsame hurdles as any other student.\nShe just has to inject herself with\ninsulin a couple of times a day and\nwatch what she eats. Diabetic? Yes.\nInconvenienced? Definitely.\nDisabled? The word just doesn't fit.\nShe herself objected to the word,\n'Yes I 've got a medical condition,\nbut I'm not very happy about it\nbeing called a disability. I don't like\nthe implications of that.' Her\nobjections were more than just\nemotive. She also felt the word to\nbe inaccurate, '.. .the term disabled\nimplies that in some way, your\nfunctionality is impaired, which\nmine isn't.' But why was she objecting to all\nthis in the first place? I certainly\nwasn't calling her disabled, so who\nwas?\nIt was all sparked off by a questionnaire circulated by the\nrecently appointed Disabilities\nOfficer, Loretto O 'Callaghan. She\nleft the Accommodation Office, and\nwas appointed Disabilities Officer\nin late January. In May, she\ncirculated a questionnaire\nconcerning the situation of people\nwith various disabilities in different\ndepartments. This questionnaire\nreferred to people with hidden\ndisabilities and listed these as:\ndiabetes, epilepsy, haemophilia,\nheart condition and cystic fibrosis.\nIt was this questionnaire, and the\nattitude that it created in her\ndepartment to which my friend\nobjected.\nI cleared my mind of all the\nprejudices that came with Loretto\nform the Accommodation Office\nwhere she used to work and left to\ntalk to her about her job in general,\nas well as clear up her apparently\nstrange definition of disability.\nHer office is in room 163 of the\nSherfield Building; the corridor that\nleads to the Bank; the corridor\ncontaining the Conference Centre;\nthe corridor that ironically has a small flight of stairs at its entrance\nand no lift access. Obviously,\nImperial desperately needs a Disabilities Officer.\nLoretto's ideas for her job\nseemed rather straightforward, 'At\nthe moment (the job consists of)\ngoing round looking at the\nbuildings... seeing whether we can\nget wheelchairs in, seeing whether\nthere's any equipment available.'\nShe continued to tell me her\nfindings; all the things that are\nwrong with Imperial, all those little\nthings that can make life very\ndifficult and access impossible to a wheelchair user. When it comes\ndown to the geography, stairs and\nramps of College, she certainly\nknows her stuff.\nHer interest did not end with\nwheelchair users. Loretto has plans\nof white stripes on dark stairways,\nfor the partially sighted, induction\nLoretto\nloops in lecture theatres for the hard\nof hearing and provisions for those\nwith language and speech\ndifficulties. So, what budget did she\nhave for this rather large\nundertaking? The answer was a very surprising no. 'It would be\nnice to have a budget, but it would\nhave to be a nicely rounded budget.'\nAt the cost of over \u00a330,000 for a disabled toilet, the budget would\nhave to be very round indeed to\nrefurbish College.\nI was starting to warm to her. The\nDisabilities Officer in her move\nfrom the accommodation office was\nnow sitting on the other side of the\nfence. She used to create masses of\nred tape and obstacles for students\nin an effort to keep the\naccommodation office afloat. Now\nshe must cut through others'\nbureaucracy to get anything done.\nBut what was her attitude toward\nthe disabled. 'People who are\ndisabled don't like being referred to\nas being any different to people who\nare... able-bodied.'\nBut are diabetics disabled?\n'.. .some diabetics have no problem;\nthey manage, but if they didn't, or\nO 'Callaghan, Disabilities Officer.\nsomething happened, and they were\ndoing some work in chemistry, they\ncould be a danger to themselves, or\nsomeone else...'. We jousted, and\nI tried to present different scenarios,\nbut Loretto kept ducking and\ndiving. She refused to budge and we\nstayed on different sides of that\nfence.\nI thanked her for the interview,\nsnapped a picture and returned to\nthe Felix Office to get a viewpoint\non the side of diabetics.\nDeidre Whitley, press officer for\nthe National Diabetic Association\nshocked me with what we had to\nsay. I asked her bluntly on the\nsociety's attitude toward the word\n'disabled', and while she did not\nlike it she did not like the word, she\nadmitted that diabetics can register\nas disabled. The word has to be\napplicable to the class as a whole,\neven if it does not fit individuals.\nThen it slowly dawned on me.\nWe have a stubborn, but very useful\nDisabilities Officer, and a girl that\nis hurt by the implication of a word.\nThis just serves to highlight an even\nbigger problem. Just why is\ndisability a stigma?\nLoretto welcomes calls about problems and\nsuggestions regarding disabled facilities at\nImperial College\non ext 3455\nPage 14\n\n"

    "content": "opinion\n11 June 1993 Felix 970\nThe course of Students' Union restructuring never did run true\nDear Editor,\nIt was with much concern that I read the article in Felix some weeks\nago regarding the Union re-arrangement. My understanding of\nChris Davidson is that he is a hard\nworking and conscientious\nPresident who has the students'\nwell-being at heart; however, I feel\nthat in this case his refreshingly\nshort involvement in ICU has led\nhim to a misguided conclusion.\nI agree with him that the Union\nCouncil is cumbersome and that\nstudent contact with Union Officials\nis sadly low, however, the Council\nis large to ensure that the students'\nrights are protected. I accept that\nICU is run in a very different\nfashion from all other Student\nUnions but I protest that this makes\nit wrong.\nICU was founded in 1909 and\nwas originally called the Union\nClub. It was there to provide\nRecreational, Social, Athletic and\nWelfare activities for the students\nof the College. In the 60s and 70s many Student Unions went through\na dramatic re-organisation taking on\nthe structure of their close\nassociates, the Trade Unions. They\nmoved their emphasis from Clubs,\nSocieties and Welfare towards\nPolitical campaigning and a training\nground for Party Politics. They\ndestroyed the concept of the\nStudents Union run by students for\nstudents and instead produced a top\nheavy and over-powerful system of\npermanent staff.\nICU wisely chose not to follow\nthis route and, in the process,\nalienated itself from the NUS\n(National Union of Students), an\norganisation which we had helped\nfound but which became so riddled\nwith this elitist political cancer in\nthe 70s that ICU found it beneficial\nto d is affiliate. Due to d is affiliation ICU today is\nvery different from all other Student\nUnions and has been, and still is,\nintrinsically more successful. ICU\nbuilt a reputation as a no-nonsense\nUnion which only made its presence\nknown when Student Welfare or\nRecreational matters were at stake.\nAs a result its negotiating power is\nmuch stronger than almost all other\nStudent Unions both within College\nand with outside organisations. For\nthe majority of the 1980s the\ncombined purchasing power of the\nNUS were unable to secure\npurchasing deals on beer ai\nfavourable as those of ICU!\nSo why was ICU's system\nstronger? I believe it was due to the\nhighly representative nature of its\ninternal structure. To make a committee that represents the\ndesires and needs of the student\nbody a Union has to ensure that\nrepresentation comes from those\nareas that are key to student\nactivity; areas where students can\ntest their representatives from day\nto day in their everyday activities\nand see those representatives, if\nonly in passing, on a week to week\nbasis. Ideally these representatives\nwould have a series of helper\nrepresentatives with their ears\ncloser to the student body and\nspread throughout the body. These\npeople should be keen and willing\nto work with the representative as\na result of their proven record of\nhard work and level headed ness whilst performing these lower\nranking jobs in previous years.\nFurther, it would seem sensible\nfor the level of representation to be\nproportionate to the level of overall\nstudent involvement in that area. IC\nUnion Council accommodates this\nideology in its structure.\nThe majority of student time is\nspent in academic behaviour. The\nCouncil has around 10\nDepartmental Represenatives\nelected by the students from those\nDepartments; these representatives\nhaving a series of helpers in each\nyear. This makes up around 25%\nof Council. Further, there are 5\nAcademic Affairs Officers, making\nup another 12% of Council, also\ndedicated to this field.\nNearly all students are members\nof a Union Club or Society run by\nhard working, down-to-earth\nstudents who converse regularly\nwith a Committee Chairman who\nsits as a representative on Council.\nThere are around 170 Clubs and\nSocieties. Approximately 60% are\nrun directly by ICU, the others are\nC CU administered, and as a result\nthey are represented by 6\nCommittee Chairman and 4 C CU Presidents, a total of 10\nrepresentatives making up another\n25% of Council.\nTwo other student activities are\nrepresented\u2014Entertainment and\nRag. However, these do not have\nthe same well-spread foundations of\nthe Departments and Clubs\nCommittees and hence only make\nup around 5% of Council with 2\nrepresentatives.\nThere are seats for three old\nstudent representatives fo provide a long term input and experienced\nadvice. However, it is fair to say\nthat benefit from this input to\nCouncil is rarely gained as these\npeople attend very infrequently.\nThe remaining 25 % of Council is\nmade up of elected Officers\nincluding the Sabbaticals, people\nwho do an immense amount of\nwork but who have little by way of\na foundation of helpers or\ninformation gatherers. Hence, they\ntend to live in ivory towers removed\nfrom the student body. Also, they\nare people who can quite often be\nelected with little or no background\nknowledge or proven track record.\nSuch elected Officials can turn out\nto be excellent Officers, as it\nappears has this year's President.\nHowever, as often as not, they\nbecome unmitigated disasters\nwhose mistakes are only uncovered\nonce they have left office! Often\ntheir input can be invaluable and\nrefreshing and, therefore, it is\ngenerally worth, carrying the elected\ndr on go in order to benefit from\nthose with real vitality.\nThe flaw in the current\nPresident's new Executive Structure\nis that he has destroyed the essential\nbalance. Those areas of student\nactivity with good support\nmechanisms that generally produce\na level-headed everyday student has\nbeen cut from 62% representation\nto 30%, and the elected Elite in\ntheir ivory towers have increased\nfrom 25% to 60%.\nFar from increasing student\ncontact with the Union, the\nPresident's Plan will reduce it. Ask\nyourselves, how many of you know\nwho the Welfare Officer is, the Post\nGraduate Affairs Officer, the\nOverseas Students' Representative,\nthe Academic Affairs Officer, or\neven the Hon Sec? It is an important\nquestion as, if the President's plan\nis to be successful, these people will\nbe running your Union by courtesy\nof the fact that between them they\nwill hold 50% of the votes.\nHave any of you met an executive\nmember from a Union run the way\nthe President proposes? Most are\nhighly Poitical Hacks who are\nelected without having been truly\ntested; they are often glory hunters\nor are merely looking for easy CV points. They are easily overcome\nwith the power and are tolerated by\na student body that is accustomed\nto this sad state of affairs and really\nknows no other alternative. Well,\nWE DO! Imperial College has had\nit for years\u2014a proper representative\nstructure! It is immensely important\nthat you defend your right to proper\nrepresentation or else your Union\nis likely to slip into a domain for\nhacks. I understand that ICU has\nmany faults; however, it is certainly\nmore representative than the many\nI have had contact with in the NUS.\nI have one other major warning:\nNUS mem be ship would be a natural\nprogression from the President's Plan. The annual membership\nwould be sufficient to obliterate the\nentire budget of any of the major\nClubs and Society Committees.\nHence, no Athletic Clubs and no\nRecreational Clubs. This might of\ncourse solve our problem of misrepresentation if in the future there\nare likely to be no clubs to\nrepresent. It would then be fair to\nsay it was a Union for 'hacks' run\nby 'hacks'!\nAt the end of the day I can only\nsay that, as an Ex-President, I would have loved to have removed\nCouncil. However, it was the main\nway of keeping me in check! I had\nthe dubious pleasure of sitting on\nover 25 meetings of the Committee\nand, although cumbersome, I still\nbelieve it to be an essential part of\npreserving the down-to-earth level\nheaded ness of IC Union.\nHaving only seen 7 meetings of\nCouncil spanning approximately 9\nmonths, does Chris Davidson really\nbelieve he is qualified to judge its\neffectiveness, let alone a suitable\nreplacement? I believe the President\nhas come to realise that the student\nbody will not stand for this\ndegradation of their representation\nand is, hence, trying to force the\nmatter through in the Summer Term\nwhen the students are hard at work\n'swatting' for exams. This used to\nbe a College Administration tactic!\nWhy have we reached the stage\nwhere the Union President has to\nadopt such under-hand tactics?\nSydney Harbour-Bridge\n(Name changed in aid of Comic\nRelief)\n(President 1987/88).\nDON'T READ THIS LETTER, READ THIS HANDY FELIX\nSUMMARY INSTEAD...\n\u2022 ICU is different from other student Unions, but this is not\nnecessarily bad.\n\u2022 ICU was formed a long time ago, helped create the NUS, then opted\nout of the NUS when it became too political\n\u2022 ICU represents students better because it is not in the NUS and\nbecause of the structure of Council.\n\u2022 The present structure allows those in power to be questioned\nthoroughly. The new structure could destroy this.\n\u2022 Few people have heard of the posts of the new executive, why\nshould this change because they now have more power?\n\u2022 Is Chris Davidson necessarily the best person to decide these\nchanges?\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\nFelix 970 11 June 1993\nLong Shot for the\nPistol Club\nLong range pistol consists of\nshooting a fairly standard handgun\nover fairly non-standard distances,\nin this case over 100, 200 and 300\nyards hitting fairly small targets\n(e.g.10 inches diameter at 200\nyards). This is a fairly tough\nproposition because to get a fairly\nnormal handgun to shoot over\nextraordinarily long distances\nrequires distinctly non-standard\nammunition. This means DIY ammo. Normally it entails putting\nas much powder as possible in the\ncase and then squashing the bullet\nin with a vice. There is a plus and\nminus to this technique. The plus is\nthat the bullet may just leave the\nbarrel quick enough to travel 300\nyards before succumbing to\nNewton's finest. The minus point\nis that there is increased risk of a small localised explosion resulting\nin instant dismissal from the range\nand equally quick admission to\nhospital. This results in a trade-off\nbetween potential accuracy and\nperceived safety. Accuracy dictates\na steady grip, cool gaze, and\ncontrolled breathing. Fears for\npersonal (no one gives a hoot about\nthe folks either side) safety result in\neyes being closed, hands over ears\nand uncontrolled whimpering. It\ngets worse when there are 30 odd\npeople doing it.\nIn pistol shooting few things are\ncertain (did I fire five, or was it\nsix?), and the team turning up is one\nsuch phenomenon. Last year\nICR&PC fielded a'B' team as a back-up in case all else failed. It\ndid. The ' A' team, consisting of the\nthen current executive, failed to\nenter the competition 'cos they were\ncrap.

Well, they would have got\na good stuffing. On seeing that IC's score was almost 3 times Oxford's1992 score they packed up and went\nhome.\nThe actual shooting saga went\nsomething like: arrive on the 100\nyard firing point at 9.00am; admire\nclear blue sky and pristine target;\nspray two five round strings down\nrange in 30 seconds per string;\nadmire clear blue sky and pristine\ntarget. CJ Hurr lead the IC team\nwith the authority of a blind man,\nscraping a paltry 41/50, AC Jones\nand EMT Young 40/50.\nOut at 200 yards and Jones\nshowed how it was done, and was\nkeen to tell others how easy it was\ntoo as he popped in a mightily\nimpressive 48/50. Hurr and Young\n43/50.\nOut at 300 yards and anything can\nhappen. Free beer, dancing girls,\nyou name it. But generally wind.\nGood for windmills, wind-surfing,\nPierre par py pants. But not good for\nshooting. Jones though was scoring\nbulls a plenty until the realisation\nthat he was in danger of another\ntrophy and that there was simply no\nroom for it at Clayponds led to a complete miss. Hurr and Young\nsuffered from wind. Scores for\nJones, Hurr and Young were 40,\n36, 34 respectively.\nSo, despite everything, IC put up\ntheir best performance ever,\naggregating 365/450. The final\nindividual scores were, AC Jones\n128/150 (6th overall), CJ Hurr\n120/150, EMT Young 117/150.\nCongrats to Jones for being an all-round-mega-hero (and writing this),\nand to Young for doing so well on\nhis first attempt. Hurr once again\nfacilitated the whole show by\nproviding all the kit and most of the\nexpertise.\nThe latest entries on the Howe\nCup now read Imperial, Imperial,\nImperial, Imperial, Imperial.\nHAIRDRESSERS\n15A HARRINGTON ROAD,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\n071-823 8968\nWe have a fantastic offer for all you\nstudents, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women\nCheck us out!\n,RR lt4 G TOM RD\nPage 1 5\n\n"

Good\njob, really; it takes a hefty dose of\nthe transcendental to cope with the\nfact that your three principals have\nall got themselves killed by the end\nof Act I. Composer Jonathan\nHarvey overcomes this problem by\nsetting Act II of his new Inquest of\nLove in the afterlife, where the\nlovers John and Ann and the\nrejected, gun-toting Elspeth have to\npurge themselves of the suffering\nthey have inflicted. This territory\nmay sound familiar, having been\ncovered by several Hollywood\nfeelgood flicks during the last few\nyears, and indeed it wasn't the only\nFelix 970\naspect of the evening that caused me\na feeling of deja vu.

He seems confident, assured\nand concerned about the job he has\nbeen elected to do.

Why not join the antics of the Pride 1993?\nRach n' Jane preview London's premier summer festival\nOne of this summer's largest, free\nfestivals hits London's Brockwell\nPark this month, featuring a wealth\nof famous faces, top performers,\nsingers, comedians and chart-topping bands. Dawn Fench will be\nthere, along with Jimmy\nSomerville, Boy George, Hazell\nDean and many more. What is it?\nPride '93, that's what and if you\nwant to know more about being\n'loud and proud and in park', read\non.\nThe festivities for the day are\ndesigned to provide something for\neveryone. Twenty seven marquees\nare to be erected including eight\nbeer tents and a champagne and\ncocktail lounge, plus a fair with all\nthe usual fairground rides. Lilly\nSavage rules the roost in the Bang\nDisco Marquee 4.30 to 7.30pm and\nloads a famous soap stars will be\nsigning audio graphs in the Health\nEducation Authorities Health Tent\nwhich will also feature 'Hunk\nAerobics'. Big name pop bands,\ntechno groups and soul singers are\npromised for the main stage, but\nthey're not telling who until the day.\nSo if you don't go, you won't know. Cabaret and Disco marquees\nabound too, along with a market\narea selling eve iy thing and anything\nyou'd expect (or not) to find at a festival market. The whole day will\nbe wrapped up with an enormous\nfirework display.\nSo what ex acd y is Pride? Maybe\nit would help if I gave the festival\nits full title, Lesbian and Gay Pride.\nYep, this whole day of free fun,\nfrolics, and music is actually\norganised and run by a bunch of\nqueers. This doesn't mean that\nstraight people can't turn up and\nenjoy themselves. On the contrary\nand what better way to end a term\nof exams than a free party when the\ngrant has run out. But, to get back\nto my point, why would a group of\npeople want to put time, effort and\nmoney into organising a massive,\nfree summer party? The whole idea\nis to promote a positive image of\nhomosexuals as otherwise, normal\nordinary everyday people. It is a chance for Gays and Lesbians to\nstand tall and be proud of their\nsexuality. After all, how are we to\nexpect others to accept us and\nmm\nrespect us for what we are if we\nlive, ourselves, in shame.\nA parade, from Victoria\nEmbankment to Hyde Park, with\nfifteen floats following the\nprocession, is expected to raise the\nprofile of Pride, but the idea of a campaigning theme for the day has\nbeen rejected. If the day has any\nmessage at all it is look, we're here,\nand we're not going to go away.\nThe Stonewall group, a gay and\nlesbian rights organisation, intends\nto simultaneously release ballon s, one for every person jailed for the\n'crime' of consenting sex with a person of the same sex. This is to\nbe the only real political event of the\nday.\nPride is not here to promote\nhomosexuality, or ram it down\npeople's throats, it is meant as an\nannual bid for acceptance. I am sure\n99% of the festival goers won't care\nabout the motives, they'll just be out\nwith the rest of us, 'loud and proud\nin the Park', and enjoying every\nminute of it. Put your prejudices\naside and join us there, I'm sure\nyou'll be pleasantly surprised.\nSaturday 19th June\n-Pride 1993.\nMarch 12.00pm from Victoria\nEmbankment.

They have\nbeen described as 'effortlessly\nfunny, delightfully inconsequential\nand quite unmissable', but I would\nrather describe them as 'simply\nhilarious'. The com per e for the\nevening is Richard Morton, the man\nwho received the Time Out\nComedy Award for 1992. Like the\nCLUBS\n&\nSOCIETIES\nAny photos, diary\ndates and names of\nnext year's chairmen\nMUST be put in the\nHandbook pigeonhole\nin the Union Office by\nthe last day of term\n(photos will be\nreturned)\nRubber Bishops, he has regularly\nappeared at the Comedy Store,\nJongleurs..., and has a reputation\nof being one of the sickest\ncomedians around. He has been\ndescribed recently as 'the new sex-king of comedy' and with a few\nsongs such as 'Daddy was a Sperm\nBank', who am I to argue. Support\nwill be announced nearer the date\n(see the next Felix for details).\nThere will be a bar til lam, disco\ntil 2am, and a happy hour from\n8.30-9.30pm. Doors open 8.00pm, with the support act onstage at\n9.30pm. So, how much does it cost for this\nfiesta of all things funny I hear you\ncry!

Buy your tickets now and\navoid the disappointment of being\nleft out in the cold. Kiss your cares\ngoodbye and have more fun than\nyou could shake a shitty stick at.\nAndy.\nCareers info\nVACANCIES\u2014don't worry if you\nwere too late to apply for the Milk\nRound, we have written to 1500\nemployers asking for details of their\nremaining vacancies and you should\napply as soon as possible this\nmonth.
