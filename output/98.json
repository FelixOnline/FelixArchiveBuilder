    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nOhm. Tech.\n9-11-56.\nBear Sir, A petition has been circulated in the college deploring the Government's action in the\nMiddle Eastern crisis. Also, a group of people\ntook part In the anti-Government demonstrations\nin Trafalgar Square carrying a placard bearing\nthe slogan: \"Imperial College Students repudiate19 th. Century iB peri all s a\". Many signatories to the petition gave their address as this college! the name of the college;\nwas dragged into politics. This, concerns us all. Imperial College is in a particularly noticeable and vulnerable position because the\npublic are spending money on its expansion.\nThe expansion is for the good of the country,\nnot ourselves. It needs the goodwill of the\nnation and government. In addition, if we wish\nto maintain our position as one of the most important colleges in England and indeed, in the\nWorld it is essential that our opinions should\nbe respected and that we should not undermine\nour own prestige.\nIn the meantime, and in any future crisis, I hope that members of this college will behave\nmore responsibly. Otherwise, I hope that they\nwill dissociate themselves entirely from the\ncollege and the Union.\nYours faithfully, D.J. Hlgson.\n(In a telephone conversation with the Mit or on Sunday, Mr. Bigson said that he wished to\nmake it quite clear that he would have been\nequally concerned had the actions he has\ncriticised been pro-Bden. It is the politics and not the sentiments to which he objects.)\nRoyal College of Scienoe,\n10th. Nov. '56.\nDear Sir,\nDaring the last few days the Press has given prominence to a number of meetings organised by\nthe students of the University of London expressing\nconcern over Hungary and Suez.\nWithout exception these meetings have been inadequately publicised on the notice boards of Imperial\nCollege, and consequently poorly supported by members\nof this College.\nWhilst it must be accepted that demonstrations of\nthe Whitehall variety are not the best way of expressing our misgivings, it would be unfortunate if this\nCollege was thought to be apathetic.\nTours etc.,\nP.

Dear Sir,\nAfter attending one of your Sat. evening hops,\nwe would like to comment an the fact that many of\nthe boys attending do not dan oe, but merely decorate\nthe walls especially near the door.\nNo girl likes being a wall-flower, and we are\neven mare surprised that the boys like being pansies.\nWe feel that these hops would be a great success\nif only everyone would dance, and if tn fe 'boys do\nnot intend to dan oe, they should not come.\nYours Sincerely,\n\"A Hopeful Wall-flower\".\nCOMING SOON.1\n!

John Hart called out for the President of Kings in order to demand an apology\nfor his d tu bio us part in the conspiracy to keep\nGuilds out of the Show. Unfortunately the gentleman did not appear so Guilds went into the main\nhall and rent the air with a 'Boomalaka'. As the\nlast echoes of this died away a stream of liquid poured down on them from a fire-extinguisher.\nThere followed a general melee with students\nof Kings, in which further fire-extinguishers\nwere used to great effect, and Guilds then withdrew through the main gates. Here the police were\nholding back an angry mob of Kings who had just\nreturned from the Show.\nAltogether the Lord Mayor's Show Day of 1956\nwill remain a memorable one and we are informed\nthat Guilds have already taken steps to ensure\nthat next year they will once more take their proper place in the Procession.\n\n"

This\ndining hall is now open for lunch, daily, on the same\nbasis as the old \"upper Dining Hall\" i.e. with waitress\nservice and at a slightly higher cost than, downstairs.\nUnfortunately the other rooms on this floor are\nthe comparatively useless Senior Conmcn Room (J), Reading Room and I. C.W. A. lounge. Of necessity the\nReading Room will remain unfurnished for a few weeks\nand will be used by the Fencing and Judo Clubs and by\nother people for \"circuit training\". These activities\nhave suffered badly during the last two years: they\nhave been moved from place to place, sometimes to abodes\nhopelessly cramped or at a considerable distance from\nI.C. Only the hardest heart would begrudge them temporary use of the Reading Room until the gymnasium is ready.\nAn excursion round the new building last Sunday\nprovided the most encouraging signs for weeks. Not\nthat electrifying progress is being made; only electrifying when compared to the previous snail's pace. An\nagonising shortage of labour is still apparent. However,\nat a recent top-level meeting (30 top-level that the\nI.C. President was not even invited to attend it) it was agreed again that all the building except the\ngymnasium and Upper Refectory should be completed by\nthe end of November. I am assured that this meeting\nwas so top-level that its decisions are pretty reliable.\nIt is now possible to walk up and down the centre\nstaircase; the Upper Refeotory boasts a completed\nceiling; the stage floor is appearing; the Concert\nHall walls are being painted a dreary grey and there\nis some activity in the Table Tennis and Billiards\nrooms. Even the gymnasium is acquiring a ceiling.\nHowever, he would be a great optimist who. could\nimagine himself seated in the lounge before Christmas, although (glad news) the crude outlines of the\nBar are be oo a a ing manifest and suggest that the new\nbuilding may yet resound to the joyful singing of\nthe Bagger club before the end of term.

Surely, one asks, there are more important\nand immediate things to consider?\nIn the belief and certainty that nothing is more\nimmediate and urgent than that individuals should d decide about their attitude t' wards Christ, meetings\nwere arranged twice daily by I.C. CU., during the week\nNov. 5-9-th. to consider the claims and message of\nJesus Christ.\nMr. Michael Griffiths spoke at all the meetings.\nHis underlying message and theme was that God had\nrevealed Himself to men and women in Christ, whose\nDeath and Resurrection makes forgiveness posa i ble for\nall who will receive. Christ is also able to make a new beginning possible in life, and He gives strength\nto o on tin ue daily in that Way.\nThe Christian Union's regular programme now con-tin u es, open meetings being held every Monday. All are welcome at these meetings.\n\n"

On both days that\ntickets were ea sale, all the sen's tickets and\nnearly all the women's tickets were sold in a matter\nof minutes. This Indicated the willingness of the\nstudents to o amply with the wishes of the authorities.\nHowever, for many of the hundreds of students unable\nto gat Harlington tickets, the attitude of the University Senate and the Metropolitan Police made it vary difficult to celebrate Guy Pawkes' Day in the\ntraditional manner.\nThe present position is thus most uns at is fac tory. Two things might be done to improve it. First,\nmore sites far students' Nov. 5th activities must be\nfound. One solution for those who would like a procession of the type now banned by the Metropolitan|\nPolice, may be to arrange a river pageant on the\nThames. Bargee, merrymakers, raft-borne bonfire and\nall would proceed down river to where ada no e or\ncarnival may be held. Provided folks refrain from\nshooting pedestrians off Bridges with rockets, the\npolice can have no re a j. objection to such a function,\nwh i oh would doubtless be welcomed by the general\npublic\nSecond, with respect to rags in general, the\nSenate should give an undertaking that disciplinary\naction would be taken only if there has been damage\nto person or property. This is fair to students and\nis enough to dt sea was* the wrong type% of rag.\nTo finish, I would like to put a sincere\nquestion, to the College and university Authorities.\nIt has been said in the past that students consider\nthemselves a privileged class. They could \"get away\"''\nwith anything during rags. Some students may have\nheld this view, but who can say we are privileged\nwhen the Senate has the power of imposing a second\npunishment after a student has already been dealt\nwith in a court of Justice?\nFred Peacock.

Four\nresidents of Selkirk Hall accident-ally found themselves carrying a placard at the head of a alien*,\nprotest march. The National Press\ndepicted these stalwarts conducting\ntheir responsible task with fortitude and solemnity.\nANYTHING FOR A RAO. It was unfortunate\nthat the organisers of the above\nprocession failed to foresee that\nearly dispersal of the students would\nresult in mora v nal fe rous demon strat ions. An hours marching round the\nback streets of Paddingtori would have\neffect iv ly lost, en route, the major-it y, of the demonstrators. The press\nfortunately failed to sense that some\ntaking part in the procession were\nonly there for the fun of It arid\nwould participate in any rag.

References\nto these are found on page 2 under \"Letters to\nthe Editor\". Let the situation be approached\nin this way. If you took an active interest in a business concern you would take care not to\nmake public, in the name of the concern, your\nviews on any issue which had divided your\nclientele. You would not wish to lose half of\nthem. In addition, your business colleagues\nmight not hold your opinions. They would be\nmost displeased, for you would have used their name as well as your own.

Interleaved in this issue you will find a questionnaire prepared by the Union Executive.\nYou are asked to complete'this and put your\ncompleted copy in one of the boxes which will be placed at convenient points about the college. This is a serious survey which is being\nconducted so that Council may be better informed about student accommodation problems. Your\nreplies will be treated as confidential. RECTOR'S GIFT.\nThe Rector has presented the Union with\nfour college crests, which will be displayed\nsomewhere in the new building, probably in the bar. The crests are made of metal and\nare duplicates of those carried by the College\nMarshals on Commemoration Day. They will be\npresented by the Rector to the President of the\nUnion at Hall Dinner on November 20th. HALL DINNER.\nHall Dinner will continue on Tuesdays in the\nNew Union until December ll th. On December 18th. the Christmas Hall Dinner (formal dress ) will be\nheld in Ayrton Hall, where the Choir will sing\ngrace and carols. All members of the Union\nmay attend Hall Dinner which is handsomely\nsub sidi sed from college funds. Bookings in the\nUnion office until l Monday lunchtime.\nHARLINGTON.\nThe Athletic Ground CommitteeHjhas high hopes\nthat the bar and tea rooms will acquire new\nfurniture soon. The rickety tea tables and\npoor quality chairs and forms are a disgrace to\nthe college. It is also hoped to obtain more\noccasional tables and easy chairs to convert\nthe room next to the bar into a bar only, with\nall teas provided in the large tea room only.\nThe sooner the better.\nMEDICATED WITH SN ZL The Christmas Issue of FELIX?\nThe Christmas Issue of FKLIX is Issue No.\n100.

YOU can help us to moke those extra eight\npages worth more than the additional 3d. This\nis an appeal to all readers of this paper to\nsend us material for selection for the hundredth Edition. Articles, jokes ( original and\nclean please I), poetry, puzzles, cartoon? and\nphotographs will all be considered. Suitable\nmaterial sent in by November 30th. will earn\nfree tickets to the Felix Dance. Do not be\nreluctant to send in contributions however\npoor you think they are.

The invitation to Guilds to take part in the procession was sent by mistake^to King's College, a small|co-education seminary near\nCharing Cross. That someone should confuse\nthis place with Guilds shows just how lacking in education are those who \"do something in the\ncity\". The scurrilous leaders of the King's mob\ndecided to keep this invitation and by the time\nthe mistake had been discovered it was stated\nby the organisers of the procession to be too\nlate to make any changes. So Guilds were al lowed to man only two floats. These facts were\nexplained by John Hart on Thursday to a crowded\nOnion Meting. The meeting was also told that\na half holiday had been granted for the occ as lei and plans could be made for a reprisal raid on\nKings after the procession.\nOn Friday morning a large number of Guildsmen made their way down to the City and congregated at the corner of Ludgate Hill and Old\nBailey. Thanks to strenuous work by Keith Duckworth and a few stalwarts from the motor club,\nBo was on the road again by Friday and altho ug fe she could not take part in the procession was\nproudly taken along to see the show. This in spite of \"dropping in a valve\" on the way. As\nis usual on such occasions, Bo itself was a big attraction. As the various King's College floats appeared down Ludgate Hill and passed the Massed\nfY nll as men, the dubious nature of their parentage\nwas freely advertised. Many other King's fall img a were explained to bystanders and policemen. The\nlatter, in particular, obviously appreciated\nthe band in age and were very good-humour ed and\neo-opera tl ve throughout the proceedings.\nOnce the procession had passed, Guilds turned their attention to more serious business,\nend, led by John Bart in Bo. swept along the\nEnbsnkncnt up to the gates of K.C. They were\ntold by the police that Bo could not stay, so\nthe President discounted and led the battle on\nfoot while Be returned to South Kensington.\ncontinued on page two.\nMORPHY DAY\n(STOP PRE5S)\nThe turnout, from Guilds and Mines for Morphy/ Day\non Wednesday was the smallest for some years. Despite\na twisted or ank shaft Bo was eventually coaxed to life and left S. \"Ken. with John Hart, the Spanner, and the\ntwo ladies of Guilds as passengers Jezebel fresh from\nher christening the day before roared down to Putney\nin fine style.\nThe main party went by the well triad District\nline. A small incident occured at Parsons Green, when\nsome members of E.C. S. took charge of an unwanted tail lamp lying on the platform. This was angrily demanded\nback by a member of the L.T. and the train was held up\nfor lOm in s. while a futile search of the carriages was\nmade. This train only continued after most of the\nGuilds people had been forced to disembark and make\ntheir way to Putney an foot.\nWhile waiting for the ll orph y boats to come out a lot of good-humour ed ragging went on in front of the\nboat house and there were one or two determined efforts by both R.C.S. and Mines to capture the Spanner.\nThese were unsuccessful however, unless one counts the\nsmall chunk of wood brutally torn from one end.\nThe Miners had as their ma soot two hydrogen filled\nballoons. These were anchored to a lamp-post but 3o on released by Guildsmen on the ro\"f of the Boat-house.\nJust before the i.l orph y crews came out the new Boat\nClub launch 'Menelaus' was christened with Kerrydown\nCider by Mrs. Lowry from the bank. 1\nMenelaus'cost \u00a3850\nis powered by a20 h.p. twin cylinder outboard motor\nand is capable of 22 Knot3.

On the rare occasions when\nhe waft Invited to parties, he failed miserably\nto Imitate the boisterous spirits of his friends, making rather a fool of himself. But\nhe would sparkle in his class, answering difficult questions with a glow of personal satisfaction. Hubert won a scholarship to Imperial College, and it is not surprising that he had\nrather an exaggerated opinion of himself. At\nI.C. life was fine. Hubert's lodgings in Baling were very comfortable and the four\nchap e who were also staying there were of like \u2022 in d. Apart from a visit to the cinema on\nSaturday nights they all worked very hard. How\nit was that others in his year were able to\nspend so much time on rowing and rugby, drama tics and dancing, chess, bridge, Union meetings and other activities, Hubert could never\nquite fathom.\nThe turning point in Hubert's career at\nI.C. was a shames meeting with an Enlightened Administrator, this gentleman took a liking to Hubert and saw that he was not obtaining\nthe full value from his stay at University. The\nB.A. found Hubert a place in an Imperial College Hostel where he soon came in to contact\nwith college life. Because he no longer had\nhis dally task to and from Outer London, he\nfound that he had time to meet these new influences h% lf-way.\nA year later found a different H.B. Smith.\nHe had found new confidence in himself. Thoroughly accepted by those who professed a dislike for the kind he had been, he joined in many Union activities. He sat on committees\nand had a reputation for being a man who could\nbe depended upon to assist with the organisation of Onion functions. Looking back, Hubert\nfound that all this had not had a detrimental\neffect on his work. It had given him a different attitude to it, but it had not a ffe c ted its quality. Unfortunately, the four who had shared lod gl ngs in Baling with Hubert were not as lucky.\nThe Bnlightened Administrator eo ul d not find hostel places for the* as wall - there are so\nfa* places for so many people. Hubert found\nit difficult to persuade them to turn away\nfrom their drab habits.

Harlington Hop\nThe Guy Fawkes' hop at Harlington was very well\nsupported this year. Judging by the queues for tickets,\nthese could have been sold twice over.\nBases started leaving the Union at 6.45 without\nthe usual fireworks display in and around them. On\narrival at Harlington one found the hall pleasantly\ndecorated and the three bars pleasantly stocked.\nOutside there was a massive wood-pile, later to provide\na first-class bonfire.\nThe dancing was soon in full swing, the selection\n\u00abf rook 'n' roll reo ard s proving very popular. In spite\nof a5050 sale of tickets, the unaccompanied males had\na lean time. It appeared that most drowned their sorrow\nin drink. The large enamel jugs, holding over a gallon\nof beer each, were frequently being filled.\nHundreds watch November5 th Celebrations\nThe time-honoured ploy:\"Shall we go and see the bonfire?\"\nwas to be heard everywhere at about 9 p.m., and soon a large crowd congregated around the inferno. The buses\nprovided a favourite vantage point from wh i oh to view the\nproceedings althea gh attention soon shifted to way out\non the rugby pitches where the fireworks got away to a rocketing start. The lapses between the individual displays were not, however, well received. There were fewer\nfireworks than in previous years and a set piece, somewhat inappropriately called \"Zambesi Falls\" rounded off\nthe show.\nBack in the warmth of the pavilion the word soon\nspread that hot-dogs were being given away. Almost a riot ensued. The Skiffle Group provided a suitable\ndiversion and soon gathered a large crowd,who at times\nalmost became \"hep\".\nAs scam as -she reo ard s came an again everyone wher\noo ul d find a partner started dancing. The excess of\nmales was in ores ed by the influx of certain undesirable-looking Harlington locals. The dance came to an end\nsurprisingly soon - al tough the fun was not yet over.\nFew of the buses reached South Kensington with a full oem fCb n> ent of light, due to the removal of the bulbs by\nse me poor sea starved XJS, men. However, the evening as\nat whole had-helped to alleviate that situation. Everyone agreed that it was good value for money.\n\n"

Savage, for\narranging a place in \"Menelaus\" for his reporter en\nMorphy Day.\nRUGBY FOOTBALLCLUB ist Round of U.L Cup\nI.C. drew U.C. in the first rou nci of the\nU.L. Cup, and thus last years Cup Final( which\nI.C. won 6-0) was virtually repeated. Unfortunatly the result was not so happy, U.C. winning\n8-3. One can only say that U.C. were slightly superior in every department of the game and\nthoroughly deserved to win. As I.C. have won the\ncup four times in five years no one will begrudge\nU.C. their victory, especially as they have had\nto endure the frustration of being beaten finalists two years running.\nI.C. were unlucky in that Ray Stone, who has\nbeen the mainspring of the attack this season,\nwas crocked on the previous Saturday. Also\nBrian Hearn was playing under the handicap of\nan injured neck, and has since been advised to\nrest for another month. It was hardly sur pri sing that he did not show his form of last year,\nalthough he almost kicked two long penalties\nwhich would have snatched an undeserving win\nfor I.C. However U.C. were superior in the\nforwards and would probably have won anyway.\nI.C. must now concentrate on building up\na strong side for their Easter tour in Cornwall.\nTo win one or more matches against such formidable opposition would be a much greater achievement than* another Cup win.\nBoxing Club J The U.L. boxing trials which were fought\nas an Inter-College competition for the B lott Cup, were held in the U.L. gym on Thursday\nNovember l st. The team from I.C. was M. Garvey,\nS. Jackson, L. Palmer, G. Halsey, J. Baker, the\nlast three named being winners of their weights.\nOnce the new I.C. gym is available, the club\nshould be confident of a good season.\nBow\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nStroke\nTHE WINNING CREWS\nMines;' Guilds'\nLowry\nD.J.

Hingley\nTHE TWO RACES\nM0HPH3C: Mines took the Surrey, R.C.S. the centre, and\nGuilds the Middlesex stations. This year the course\nwas slightly shorter than previously and the start was\na line taken from the first flight oi steps on the S. bank and the second 'Warning' notice on the N. bank an\nthe Putney side of Hammersmith Bridge.\nPositions and times were as follows:\n(Mines = M; Guilds = G, and Jl.C.S.=R) Erne\nPlace\nHarrods\nCrabtree\nMilepost\nFootball Grnd.\nBrook\nBoathouae\nFinish\nOm45\u00bb\n1m30 s2m35s3 m45s4 m5035m35 s7m09s! \u00a3\u2022 C \u00ab Sa\nCl = length)\nMG41 RM at- GaRM11 G1^1R GJ lM21R G canvas M21R M overtakes GM canvas G41R The Guilds, cox was more clever than the Mines cox and .\nthis difference was probably worth a length to the C.&G \u00bb boat. Fearing a cross-wind which blew strongly at\nthe start, Bumby took an unnecessarily wide sweep an\nthe bend. The race was a fairly fast one but the stroking for the greater part of the race was between 28\nand 30.\nLOWRY: The wind seemed stronger during this second\nrace wh i oh started at the milepost. Guilds took\nthe centre, R.C.S. the Middlesex, and Mines the Surrey\nstations. Guilds drew ahead right from the start, with\ntheir co^ steering a rather zig-zag course. Whether or\nnot this was intentional, it served to confuse the\nother o ox es. Guilds maintained their lead and went onto beat R.C.S. by 2 lengths in 4m20s. Mines lagged\nunexpectedly right from the start, finishing 2 lengths\nbehind R.C.S. HOCKEY After losing40 to Ashford on the previous Saturday, I.e. visited U.C. on Wed. Oct.\n31st. and gained a21 win. Both the goals resulted from keen following up ir.to the ci cle, suited from keen following up into the circle, a practice which should be continued. The 4-1\ndefeat by Vickers-Armstrong on the following\nSat. would have been much lighter had I.C. shown more spirit In the forward line and cooperation in the defending circle as they had\nalmost half the play. On Nov.7th. the U.L. cup\nmatch against Chelsea Poly, at MItcham resulted in a41 win for I.C. who fielded a side which\nincluded four U.L. players. On the whole the\nteam gave a promising display although against\nbetter teams it will be necessary to restrict some of the free-lance tactics used with fair success in this game.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College Union, London, S.W.7.

Nov. 2nd. eight of the more experienced members of the club went to the Llanber is Pass, North Wales for the week-end.\nThe monotony of the long drive ended as we\napproached Bettws-y Coed. The well known mountains were beginning to rise over the foothills and already the party was planning the week-end\nahead.\nThe Ll an ber is Pass is a steep sided valley\nwhich separates Snowdoti from the Glyders. On\nthe walls of this valley there are many steep\ncliffs and buttresses with terraced tops giving rise to climbs of a difficult or severe\nnature. Among the climbs done were Or a ck stone Rib, the Cracks, Pharoes Wall and many others\nat or above severe standard.\nOn Saturday evening, four members spent\nthree very enjoyable hours at the Pen-y Gwyrd\nHotel. They were lucky enough to get a lift back to the camp four miles away.\nLike Saturday, Sunday dawned misty and the\ngrey cliffs looked very foreboding. Towards\nthe afternoon the misty walls of the valley\nclosed in and it started to drizzle. The whole\nvalley was silent now except for the distant\nrush of a stream and the urgent roar of a Pri mus making the last cup of tea.\nIf the week-end is to be judged on climbing standards alone, it was probably one of\nthe best meets the club has ever held. More\nthan this, every member enjoyed himself to the\nfull, the only regret being the shortness of\nthe stay.\nSAILING CLUB I.C. Sailing Club won its team match on 10th. November, against Southampton University by\n36^ pts. to 35^ pts. In the first race sailed in very gusty conditions, the first boat of\neach team failed to complete the course, leaving\nI.C. with l st. and 4th. places and a lead of\nfp t. After a very interesting first lap, the second\nrace developed into a procession with I.C. boats\n3rd.,4 th., and 5th., one cf the Southampton\nboats later retiring giving I.C.a three quarter\npoint lead.\nThe I.C. team was:-M. Collyer(Capt) and O. Clarkson.\nC. Ghent and A. Danbury.\nJ. Webb and C. French.\n\n"
