We hope that you have\nenjoyed reading RCSU Broadsheet\nthis year and keep reading next year!\nThe RCSU this year has had fantastic turn-outs to events, with Freshers\nenjoying a taste of top class bars in\nChelsea during our pub crawl, taking\nfull advantage of our Autumn Ball to\nmake friends and amazing discounts\nat the \u2018RCSU Bookshop\u2019. As usual\nMascotry was rife in the RCSU, with\nus successfully acquiring the CGCU\nSpanner and Bolt during fresher\u2019s\nfair which ultimately led to pieing\nof Temi Ladega (CGCU President).\nFreshers also got involved and I was\nsurprised by a mysterious looking\ngroup of Freshers knocking on the\no\ufb03ce door carrying the Medics mascot (Phoenix costume).\nFirst term was jam packed with\ncareer events from Ernst & Young\nand Deutsche Bank as well as innovative and informative lectures from\nthe Imperial College Business School\nand Imperial Innovations. The aim\nwas to build on the long term bene\ufb01ts for students and making them\naware of the broad range of opportunities inside and outside of science.\nRCSU Welfare Week was also a big\nhit, with students fully exploiting the\nSTI Clinic, Doctor Bike and Self-defence classes. On top of that students\nenjoyed the free smoothies which\nwere handed out along with highly\nsubsidised ice-skating. The Union\ndoes care about student welfare more\nthan you think and with over 1000\nfree RCSU branded condoms handed\nout this year, I need not comment\nfurther on the sexual activity of students in the RCSU.\nThe joint CGCU-RCSU Winter Ball\nwas a sell-out, held at an all exclusive\nvenue with a \u00a310,000 bar tab. Some\npeople may question whether it was\na good idea to let the engineers near\nour RCSU girls or whether \u00a310,000 is\ntoo much. But a party with a gathering of around 700 Imperial students,\nthis is the largest Imperial party preceeding Christmas and an awesome\nend to an awesome \ufb01rst term.\nRCSU RAG this year has been exT\ntremely active such as helping in the\norganisation of a cake sale for chari-ty. A few members of the RCSU team\nalso took part in Movember to raise\nmoney for men\u2019s health. Currently\nthe RCSU is running a campaign and\naccepting donations to support the\nBangladesh Factory disaster. Find\nout more by going to the RCSU\u2019s Facebook page.\nThe start of 2013 saw the launch of\nthe RCSU Science Challenge hosted\nby our Science Challenge Chair,\nRyan Browne. This is our annual essay writing competition, which this\nyear saw an additional twist with the\naddition of a video category. This\ncompetition was open to all Imperial\nstudents and a large range of secondary schools. With over \u00a34000 worth\nof prizes, a trip to CERN and a \ufb01nal\nat the House of Lords, this is one of\nthe largest science communication\ncompetitions in the UK. A big thank\nyou to our judges, which this year\nincluded Lord Robert Winston, Sir\nBrian Hoskins, Sir Roy Anderson and\nDr Jad Marrouche.\nTowards Easter, the RCSU Spring\nBall took place at the cosy Warwick\nBar. The theme was Red & White,\nwhere we tried to challenge some\nof the conventions of a formal ball.\nGirls came dressed in beautiful red\nand white dresses, whilst many a\nman came in red chinos with a white\nshirt.\nThe end of term also saw the RCSU\nInterdepartmental Quiz, where the\nDep Socs came together to organise\na successful quiz night, intellectually\nchallenging many a student.\nThe end of academic year 2012/13\nis fast approaching, so join the RCSU\nfor a \ufb01nal party at Grace Bar on the\n25th June 2013. Let\u2019s end this year at\nthe RCSU Summer Ball with a blast.\n\u00a39000 has been placed behind the\nbar, so get ready for the PARTY OF\nTHE YEAR! For those graduating\nthere is a Final Year\u2019s Dinner prior to\nthis which comes with a champagne\nreception and 3 course meal.\nFinally I hope that you have enjoyed the RCSU this year and I would\nlike to take this opportunity to thank\nall the volunteers in the RCSU committee for their hard work and wish\nthe best of luck to Plabon Saha,\nRCSU President-elect.\nRCSU with their Jezebel\nFuture RCSU President Plabon saha.\nHe\u2019s really sensitive about his disfigured feet. Best not to mention it...\nOne of the RCSU balls.\nSweaty balls. Mmmmmmm\nAll photos courtesy of RCSU\nYou can feel the chem-istry. Get it, because it\u2019s\na science.

I thought that\nit was the summer term\nand so it would be chill,\nand, besides, I\u2019ve done this weekly slog\nso many times that I should be used to\nit by now. I was very mistaken. This is\na bigger mistake than that time Justin\nBieber\u2019s mum said to Justin Bieber\u2019s\ndad \u201cI\u2019m feeling sexy tonight, baby\u201d.\nThat might not have happened, but you\nget the drift. I write this, as you can definitely tell from the writing style, from\nunder my desk at the very last minute.\nLike with so many things, you think\nthe last time will be the last time, but it\nusually isn\u2019t. So, here goes nothing. Remember these are not as well formed\nas they could be, and the perennial\ndisclaimer about some considerations\ndeleted due to space requirements.\nAccess to education\nIt\u2019s fairly safe to say that everyone\nthinks that no matter what background\nyou come from you should be allowed\nto go to university. If you\u2019re clever and\nwilling to learn, there should be nothing in your way. Unfortunately, there are\nmany things in people\u2019s ways. Imperial,\nuniversities, and the Outreach Department, sadly, can\u2019t fix all of them alone. I\nknow first hand that Outreach do work\nhard and do some great work. But they\nhave so much to fight against. This is\nreally an area where no one person or\ngroup can truly be blamed. You could,\nand people probably do, argue until\nyou\u2019re all blue in the face (and have stereotypical movie-style sexual tension)\nabout where blame should be attribut-ed. Here\u2019s an example: it\u2019s the universities\u2019 fault! Is it? What about the schools\nthat teach the students for the majority\nof the time. Ah! I have it! It\u2019s those darn\nschools. They\u2019re not engaging enough\nin their lessons. So simple. Right? The\nschools? So it\u2019s their fault that behaviour is bad and people don\u2019t listen to\nteachers or do their homework? Besides, the kids still spend most of their\ntime at home. The parents then? Duh\nit\u2019s all their fault. Oh really? How about\nwhen you have a lot of other pressures\non you and are trying your best but\nyour child is influenced by their peers.\nThe kids then? Well, they are just, you\nknow, children. I\u2019m 23 and still imma-ture, so what do you expect them to\nbe like? Plus there are bigger problems\nand pressures in the world that causes\nthem to be like that. I could go on, but I\nthink you get the point. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s\nfault in some way. Besides, when has\nattributing blame ever solved a prob-lem? If there is one person to blame,\nthen it may help identify a solution.\nHowever, in a multi faceted problem,\nit is often just a way of slowing everything down. The schools, universities,\nand government must work together to\nsolve this. Parents need to be brought\nin on this too.\nA problem often identified by teachers\nand classroom assistants is behaviour,\nwhich often hinders people excelling\nand learning as teachers are essentially\ncrowd controllers not knowledge im-parters. Solving this is really trickyand\na start is teachers knowing how to deal\nwith unruly pupils. I believe all people\ndeserve a chance to shine and should\nbe helped. If they are holding themselves and others back, then they need\nto be shown, in terms they can under-stand, what a good education can bring\nthem, and why it\u2019s better to work hard.\nI guess at school it\u2019s just not cool to be\nthe good pupil is it \u2013 how many rogue-ishly handsome movie heroes are not\ntrouble-makers? Solving that would\nmean a massive shift in societal perceptions,whichprobablywon\u2019thappen.\nSeeing the light\nAnother catering outlet. Really? I hope\nthis is an ellaborate end of year troll by\nCollege. If I were anyone working in\nany space around College I would be\nwatching my back. They seem to ruthlessly just rip something away from you\nsaying \u201cwe\u2019re taking our ball back now\u201d.\nT\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 14 JUNE\n14\nChris Kaye\nkay, so you\u2019ve studied\nhere for perhaps as\nmuch as four years, or\nmaybe even more. You\nlook at your peers on\nyour course and perhaps it doesn\u2019t occur to you that they may soon become\n\u2018persona not grata\u2019 due to visa restric-tions, and very soon be unceremoniously removed from the country.\nIt\u2019s odd to think that HM Government would be so keen to deport\nhard-working, intelligent people at a\ntime of economic di\ufb03culty like this.\nBut, unfortunately, they lack those\nmagic words \u2018European Union\u2019 on\ntheir passports and so they\u2019re screwed.\nNever mind that they may be Australians or Canadians or Hong Kongers,\nwho are British in all but name, and\nwhose family sacri\ufb01ced so much to\nkeep us free from oppression in the\n1940s. They\u2019re not welcome, oh no!\nIt\u2019s really disgusting, our priorities\nas a country. Firstly, our Government\n\ufb01ghts to prevent giving Right of Abode\nto Gurkhas, and it\u2019s only in the face of\na campaign by Joanna Lumley and\nboth the Conservatives and Lib Dems\nthat the then Labour Government re-lents. Secondly, we\u2019ve had a Government reluctant to allow loyal Afghan\ninterpreters, fearful for their lives, the\nright to live here.\nHowever you look at it, it\u2019s a weird\nset of priorities. Those who have put\ntheir trust in Britain get screwed over,\nyet those who have contributed nothing get everything, just because we\u2019re\nmembers of an undemocratic, self-serving organisation like the European\nUnion.\nWhat\u2019s perhaps worse than the cases I\u2019ve highlighted is those of British\nNationals (Overseas). They are Hong\nKongers, born before the Handover to\ncommunist China, who chose to adopt\nsome form of British Nationality while\nthey still lived in a British territory.\nTheir passports look exactly like ours,\nhave the Royal Crest on the front, and\nare issued with the full authority of\nthe Crown. Woe betide them, how-ever, if they thought they could live in\nthe country of their nationality! No,\nBN(O) gives no rights to live in the\nUK. You may have moved to Hong\nKong thinking the British would protect you from the evil regime you \ufb02ed.\nI\u2019m afraid you were mistaken. Our\nGovernment, guided by our civil ser-vice, doesn\u2019t care about you. We only\ncare about being \u2018good Europeans\u2019.\nIf you do have a sense of right and\nwrong, and are a British Subject, you\ncan sign a petition about giving full\nrights to BN(O)s at http://epetitions.\ndirect.gov.uk/petitions/44679.\nChristopher Kaye is next year\u2019s Campaigns O\ufb03cer and tweets @okaye_\nchris\nThe Government\u2019s treatment of overseas nationals is reprehensi-ble, and is threatening a large number of students at Imperial\nDeportation Woes\nO\n\u201d\nYour peers on\nyour course\n... may soon\nbecome \u2018persona non grata\u2019 due to visa\nrestrictions.\nWe do occasionally edit letters and comments we receive to\nimprove spelling, grammar, and clarity of expression.\nOnline\nOur pick of the best banter from felixonline.co.uk\nIn response to \u201cCollege put students\nlast at Harlington\u201d (31st May)\nFinally someone had the guts to say it.\nIC is a total sell out, the students always come last. Renting out the Queen\u2019s\nLawn to put up marquees thoughout\nthe whole spring/summer, selling o\ufb00 the\nHolland Club for yet another catering\noutlet, selling o\ufb00 Evelyn Gardens and\nClayponds in order to ship o\ufb00 the \ufb01rst\nyear students to North Acton, and the\nlist goes on. Let\u2019s face it, at IC it\u2019s all\nabout the money. This place is run like a\nbusiness, not a university. It\u2019s a disgrace.\n---Bring on the further commercialisa-tion of the college! Who needs students\nanyway? Wouldn\u2019t IC make a lot more\nmoney without us getting in the way at\nall?\nI look forward to reading the college\u2019s\npublic response in Felix.\nOh wait.\n--Can\u2019t believe they made people park\nnext to bins! What a disgrace!\nI was playing at Harlington the same\nday, and as I recall it was sunny, so no\nneed to shelter in the car. I agree that\nthe college sometimes puts students as a\nsecondary priority, but this article just\nseems like someone whining because\nthey didn\u2019t get to park in their usual\nplace. Boo hoo. The walk from those\nbins 20 metres or so away from the\nhockey pitch isn\u2019t exactly a mission.\nTalking about WW1 is frankly irrela-vant and just sensationalist.\nThe fact that QPR has use of the training grounds has given IC football use of\nprofessional football coaches almost\nevery training. And QPR\u2019s predecessor\nat Harlington, Chelsea built the arti\ufb01cial pitch, which is used every week\nby Imperial\u2019s 1st team. But yes, these\nbene\ufb01t\u2019s de\ufb01nately do not outweigh the\nhumiliation of having to park next to a\nbin. Can\u2019t beleive Imperial are debasing\nalumni in this way. What an abuse of\nhuman rights!\n---The college needs to start putting students \ufb01rst, but this type of article needs\nto be written by someone with real\ngrievances. I don\u2019t mean to be so con-frontational, but I did \ufb01nd using the\nfallen from WW1 to back up an argument against parking next to bins quite\ndisrespectful.\nAnd at the risk of disagreeing with another comment above, IC students are\nvery lucky to have free use of Ethos for\nthe duration of their studies. Not many\nother students can say the same, and\nhave to pay huge membership fees for\ngym use.\nHaving said that, I do feel the university is being increasingly run for pro\ufb01t,\nand I do agree with the author of the article about sport being a central part of\nuniversity life. It has certainly been my\nbest experience at uni, and I hope the\ncollege\u2019s attitude does not spoil this for\nfuture students.\n--It\u2019s not just the sports facilities. The\nnumber of times as a student the Union Bar has been closed to students for\nprivate functions (for external non stu-dents) or we have been evicted from tables \u201creserved\u201d for similar is ridiculous.\n---\n"

It\nseemsevenCollegeCateringarepartialtothedoodle.\nFRIDAY 14 JULY\n22\nMayerling is dark and majestic ballet\nwhich depicts the decadent splendour\nof the Austro-Hungarian empire. It\nis based on the life of the tormented\nCrown Prince Rudolf who after forcefully marrying Princess Stephanie of\nBelgium is drawn into a spiral of political intrigue, violence, drugs, obsessive love and insanity. This true story\nof the downfall of the Crown Prince\nRudolf drags in everyone around him\nfrom members of the Austro-Hungarian Royal family, to friends, lovers and\nservants. They lived in a time when\ncorruption was rampant, hypocrisy\nendemic and decadence unavoidable;\nthus, there is no character that remains untarnished by the end.\nDespite Prince Rudolf carrying the\nweight of the piece, he has a profuse\nset of characters around him who help\nportray the decadent circus that the\nroyal court has become. In the \ufb01rst\nact he insults his bride by \ufb02irting with\nher sister after the wedding, this presents the \ufb01rst of the numerous pas a\ndeux of Mayerling. Chided by his father Emperor Franz-Josef, he visits his\nmother but \ufb01nds little relief. Finally\nhe returns to his chambers to terror-ise his newly wed bride. Their duet is\nof an incredible emotional intensity.\nSeemingly drunk Rudolf threatens to\nshoot Stephanie. The next instant he\n\ufb02irts with committing suicide. Violently dancing across the whole stage,\nthrusting Stephanie into the air to\nthen catch her again, grabbing her\narms while she tries to free herself to\nthe return to his arms: their duet is full\nof dark sexual tension.\nThe choreography designed by Kenneth MacMillan is an absolute master-piece. There are plenty of duets which\nportray the tortuous and obsessive\nrelations that Rudolf has with the numerous women of his life. From the\nbrilliant plea to his mother in the \ufb01rst\nact, to his violent wedding night to his\nromantic duets with his mistress Mary\nVetsera the choreography exudes a\ndark sexual tension. Mayerling is one\nof the few ballets in which the male\nprotagonist carries the weight of the\nwhole act. The role of Crown Prince\nRudolf demands from the dancer not\nonly incredible physical skill but also\nexcellent theatrical interpretation and\nacting.\nThese intimate duets full of emotional intensity are balanced by the\nlarge-scale group dances. The pomp\nand lavishness of the royal wedding\nfrom the \ufb01rst act contrasts with the\nseediness of the tavern in the second\nact. The numerous changes of scenes\nare seamlessly tied together and serve\nas testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the stage crew. From the\ncorridors of the royal palace its boastful and splendid ball rooms and the\ndark streets and taverns of Vienna the\naudience will feel immersed in the sto-ry. We were guided tumultuously to\nthe \ufb01nal stop, Mayerling, a Viennese\nhunting lodge belonging to the Empire\u2019s Crown Prince Rudolf. Here the\ndrama reaches its peak. A destroyed\nRudolf takes a step that will bring pain\nand sadness to his family.\nThe ballet is one of the most psychologically complex and packed with political nuances, thus one can feel lost\namong the complicated relationship\nbetween the characters. The second\nact opens at a Viennese tavern; there\nRudolf further tortures Stephanie by\nintroducing her to his occasional mistress Mitzi Caspar. Once Stephanie\nleaves disgusted, there is a suggestive\npiece danced by the tavern prostitutes\nwhile Rudolf and his friends delight\nthemselves with the spectacle.\nThroughout the ballet Rudolf is\nsurrounded by his politically in\ufb02uential friends: murmurings, gossip and\nintrigue abound and pamphlets are\nhanded out. Rudolf seems distant and\nlost in this corrupt world, again \ufb02irting with suicide.\nIt is by the end of the second act\nwhen he encounters Mary Vetsera.\nThis impressionable and neurotic\nyouth shares Rudolf\u2019s \ufb01ckleness and\nemotional obsession. Their \ufb01rst duet\ndepicts an intense, obsessive even sad-omasochistic love. During their passionate dance Rudolf keeps fantasis-ing about death, constantly grasping\na gun but he seems to have found his\nmatch in Mary. She rejects him when\nhe is at her feet, \ufb01ckly regains the gun\nfrom his hands and threatens him just\nas he did a second before. The smouldering eroticism and the morbidity of\nthis duet echoes that one of the \ufb01rst\nact. However, Rudolf\u2019s partner is now\nneither scared nor at his mercy but\nsomeone as fully tortured and neurotic as him. The curtains fall as this\ndramatic couple hold each other in an\nembrace, intensely staring at the gun\nthey are holding.\nA life of sex, drugs\nand pas de cheval\nRocio Molina Atienza Writer\nReal men wear\ntights and\nmoustaches\n\n"

It therefore came as\nno surprise when this week his paper\non drug legislation and its possible\nin\ufb02uence in neuroscience research\ncame with an underlying message: it\u2019s\nabout time the government got their\nact together.\nThe paper, published this Wednesday in Nature Reviews Neuroscience,\noutlines how the national laws and\ninternational conventions surrounding psychoactive drugs (those that\ne\ufb00ect the brain) has signi\ufb01cantly delayed further research into them, stat-ing, \u201cThis hindering of research and\ntherapy is motivated by politics, not\nscience... It\u2019s one of the most scandalous examples of scienti\ufb01c censorship\nin modern times.\u201d\nPsychoactive drugs such as canna-bis, LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin are\nregularly classi\ufb01ed as more \u201cdangerous\u201d than others, including heroin,\nwhich result in erecting complex bureaucratic barriers around research\nthat often are impossible to overcome.\nHowever, preliminary research suggests such drugs may o\ufb00er therapeutic treatments for those su\ufb00ering from\nmental disorders.\nSuch classi\ufb01cations are there for a\nreason though, surely? Nutt argues\nagainst this, saying drug classi\ufb01cation\nprocedures are \ufb02awed. The USA classes drugs by Schedules, with Schedule\nI roughly the equivalent to Class A/B\ndrugs and encompassing cannabis,\nLSD and MDMA among others.\nCurrently, part of the criteria for a\nSchedule I drug is that it has no accepted medical use. The fact that, with\nresearch severely limited for Schedule\nI drugs, there is no chance of \ufb01nding\nmedical uses for such drugs, Nutt\npoints out that such arguments are\ncircular in nature.\nNot only that, but with cannabis\nhaving known medicinal purposes\nand can be legally prescribed in 18\nstates, it appears that the criteria either are not being adhered to pur-posefully, or the Americans simply\ncan\u2019t understand their own rules.\nThat is not to say we are faring any\nbetter across the pond \u2013 the UK too\nare appearing dismally incoherent\nwhen it comes to drug classi\ufb01cation.\nBeyond the Class System used we too\nindulge in a Schedule-based approach\nthat places cannabis, LSD, MDMA,\nand psilocybin above heroin in respect to the same sort of criteria the\nUSA use, making heroin more accessible (if only by a fraction) for research\nthan those that possess psychoactive\nproperties.\nResearch that has managed to\nsqueeze through the bars of bureaucracy has provided a great insight into\nwhat we are actually missing. Cannabinoid 1 receptors which respond\nto cannabis-derived compounds are\nincredibly widespread throughout\nthe brain, and the inhibition of using\ncannabis in research is hindering the\nunderstanding of these.\nCannabis may also aid alleviation\nof ADHD symptoms safely, but again\nwith the laws comes little literature\npublished to help develop this idea.\nNot only that, other products of the\nplant may be used to treat seizures,\nanxiety, psychosis and even addiction,\nbut again, since we really aren\u2019t allowed anywhere near the plant in the\nlabs by the government we can\u2019t really\nhelp with any of these any time soon.\nMDMA too may provide more highs\nin medicinal research than it currently\ndoes for art students under derelict\nbridges in East London. With a small\ntrial in the USA managing to prove\nthat MDMA-based treatment may\nbene\ufb01t those su\ufb00ering from PTSD,\nreplications are desperately needed\nto develop this, as currently PTSD\nmanagement is scarce. Pro-empathy\nactions (the fancy way of describing\nof how MDMA makes you love everything so deeply and emotionally, and,\nunfortunately, embarrassingly so)\nmay also help those with autism, and\nits ability to reduce tremors may offer therapeutic options for those with\nParkinson\u2019s Disease.\nNot only that but the spike in use\nof methedrone, a stimulant similar to\nMDMA, correlated to a 20% decrease\nin deaths due to cocaine in one year.\nHowever, with the banning of this and\nits analogues, research into its possi-ble, controlled use as a substitute for\ncocaine addiction is no longer a pos-sibility.\nLSD, before its ban in the 1960s under speculation that its use by American youths was behind the decline of\ninvolvement in the Vietnam War, was\nshowing signi\ufb01cant progress in neuroscience research too. It had potential to be a treatment for alcoholism,\nand as an aid in easing those with a\nterminal illness.\nPsychedelics in general were theorised to treat those with migraines,\nbut research on this was hindered\nwhen LSD and magic mushrooms in\nparticular were moved to Schedule I\nstatus.\nObviously, such \ufb01ndings are not\nclearly indicative of anything substan-tial, but nor do they lack the ability to\ndevelop into something within the fu-ture. Nutt has never been one to shy\naway from targeting the government\nabout its legislations, which are often\nbased on politics as opposed to sci-ence, and during his stint as ACMD\nchairman, ranked tobacco and alcohol as having greater negative e\ufb00ects\ndue to dependence and physical harm\nthen cannabis and LSD.\nHis continued rebuttal against legislation using scienti\ufb01c evidence led\nto his dismissal from the government,\nbut it seems increasingly di\ufb03cult to\nargue against him with publications\nsuch as these featuring between the\npages of such a respected journal.\nRegardless of any opinion about le-galisation or declassi\ufb01cation of drugs,\nit does seem that there is a distinct\nlack of both scienti\ufb01c knowledge and\nrigour when setting drug classi\ufb01cations, and it is imposing signi\ufb01cant\nhindrances on the progression of neuroscience research. The government\nmay have made a mistake in letting\nNutt go \u2013 it seems now more than\never a scientist is needed to keep politicians in check.\nDOI: 10.1038/nrn3530\nLove Science?\n(Only a week left to make that lie you told on\nyour CV a reality)\nWhy not write for us?

Instead, we\nshould all kneel before the real Michael Shannon, easily one of the most\nunderrated, under-awarded, and\nunder-recognised actors working to-day. He\u2019s the anti-hero of The Iceman,\na taut retelling of the life of Richard\n\u201cRichie\u201d Kuklinski, an AmericanPolish mob hitman who was arrested\nhaving killed what is believed to be\nwell over 100 people.\nWe \ufb01rst see how he and his wife\nDeborah (Winona Ryder) \ufb01rst met.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a prettier version of Natalie\nWood,\u201d possibly the highest compliment that could be paid to a woman\nabout her appearance in the 60s, is\nuttered shyly by Richard. He claims\nhe dubs Disney movies, when in fact\nit\u2019s revealed he makes his living by\npirating pornographic movies. His\nknack for killing is revealed early in\nThe Iceman\nDirector: Ariel Vromen\nScreenwriters: Morgan Land, Ariel\nVromen, Anthony Bruno (book), Jim\nThebaut (documentary)\nStarring: Michael Shannon, Winona\nRyder, Ray Liotta, Chris Evans, David\nSchwimmer, Stephen Dorff, James\nFranco\nthe \ufb01lm; after an ill-advised verbal\nexchange that ends with someone\ninsulting Deborah, that poor sucker\ngets his throat slit \u2013 rather neatly it\u2019s\nalso worth noting, showing that this\nis far from the \ufb01rst time Richard has\ndone something like this.\nAfter an encounter with a local mob\nboss Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta), who is\nimpressed by Richard\u2019s ice-cold de-meanour that shows virtually no fear\nof dying, Richard is privately hired to\nwatch Roy\u2019s back, collect debts, and\nsend \u201cmessages\u201d. Long gone are the\ndays he supported his family living in\na small apartment \u2013 the pay rise is a\nmassive one, and soon he\u2019s living the\nAmerican Dream: in a sizable house\nin the suburbs, with his beautiful wife\nand two daughters who are all oblivious as to what their husband/father\ngets up to when he goes to work.\nRichard is very good at what he\ndoes: and in the central role Shannon is simply outstanding. With his\ntowering frame and a disturbingly\ncalm expression as he carries out\nthe many, many hits required by the\nmob, Shannon is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to loading\nthe character with quiet intensity. He\nhas a softer side to show for himself\nwhen it comes to matters concerning\nhis family \u2013 it\u2019s a look of love and de-votion, whilst there is also that inevitable cloud of worry that hangs over\nhis head, given the nature of the work\nthat he\u2019s involved in. In portraying a\nvery humane side to someone who\nappears to lack any sense of \u201cgood\u201d,\nShannon always has an air of ambiguity that makes his volatile character\nmore unpredictable.\nDespite the fantastic performance,\nit must be noted that his \u201ccareer\u201d that\nspanned decades is quickly rushed\nthrough by using many frequent time\njumps of many years, only showing\nthe few highlights of his killing days.\nIt doesn\u2019t dig deep enough into the\nwork of a mob hitman, and at times\nthe \ufb01lm seems to be more interested\nin the less gripping, unnecessarily\noverblown ma\ufb01a politics that leads to\nfamiliar territory as everything unfolds away from Shannon.\nNo ma\ufb01a movie casting is complete\nwithout Liotta, and he rocks up in a\npredictable yet e\ufb00ective role, David\nSchwimmer (i.e. Ross from Friends),\nbarely recognisable with his moustache and ponytail, is a young, ambitious player who steals too much\nand lies too much. We all know what\nhappens to that kind in \ufb01lms like\nthis. Speaking of barely recognisable actors, Chris Evans, who usually dons the Captain America suit,\ninstead sports grizzly hair and generally greasy appearance here, as a killer\nwho may be as psychotic or perhaps\neven more so, than Kuklinski himself.\nNot a lot is given away in terms of\ntrying to explain why Richard is the\nway he is, aside from a brief \ufb02ashback\nsequence into his childhood, and also\nthe concise yet hugely e\ufb00ective and\ninformative scene in which Richie\nvisits his brother Joseph (the excellent Stephen Dor\ufb00) in prison. Here\nwe see the two estranged, dysfunctional brothers reminisce in their\nown way, about the disturbing events\nsurrounding their childhood, giving\nus some insight as to explain their\nnature.\nThroughout there is a lot of focus\non the fact that Kuklinski doesn\u2019t hurt\nwomen or children, and his domestic\nlife that keeps him somewhat grounded is one of the key themes. It\u2019s nice\nto see the age-resistant and talented\nWinona Ryder have a prominent role\nagain, as \u201cthe good wife\u201d, always staying loyal to her husband even though\nit\u2019s obvious he\u2019s keeping secrets. Over\nthe years we see huge changes in\nwealth in their lives, and like any mob\nwife, Deborah has no problem accepting the nice gifts her husband buys for\nher, and yet at times she does wonder\njust how he\u2019s managing to a\ufb00ord such\nluxury. There\u2019s doubt, from the more\ncautious side of her for sure, but also\nan element of trust, this one stemming from the loyal, a\ufb00ectionate side.\nWith a calm, but never comfortable\nscore that always lurks around like a\ntroublesome event waiting to unfold,\nhere is a quiet yet by no means a tame\nthriller, one that centres on a smouldering performance that is simply\nunforgettable. And for a \ufb01lm that has\nits ending clearly cut out for us from\nthe beginning, it\u2019s still an immensely\nfascinating ride.\n\u201cYou better hit bull\u2019s eye\u201d - Vanilla Ice\nThe Apprentice - 1975\n\n"

My \ufb01rst words on smoking\nmy allocated e-cigarette were, \u201cthis\ntastes like smoking a dusty egg in a\nsauna\u201d. In my all too numerous returns to the device I never managed\nto elucidate a more pithy nor precise\ndescription of the experience. As you\ncan probably tell by now, this review will not be positive. Mine\ncame in a red box, which\napparently means regular strength, meaning\nyou get the full eggy\nexperience.\nNow, I am on record\nas being a fairly unabashed smoker. I have\ninhaled some pretty\nknarly things in my\ntime from the\nrelatively throat\ns c r a t c h y\nG a u l o i s e s\nt h o u g h\ndodgy Bulg a r i a n\ncounterfeits up to\nan includ-ing, to my\nsmouldering regret, rollies\ndrunkenly assembled from bus tickets (never do that).\nAll of these had a\ntaste which vaguely\nharked back to\nsomething that\nmight have\nonce come\nfrom a plant\nincluding, technically, t h a t\none bread stick (never do that either).\nThe E-light did not hark back to\nanything apart from possibly a starch\n\ufb01lled swimming pool. See, I never\nbeat the eggs \u2013 \ufb01guratively. The claim\nthat one charge replaces 30 cigarettes\nwas fairly ludicrous and it is going\ntake a few weeks to repair the damage\nmy street-cred accrued when the guy\nfrom the o\ufb00-licence saw me smoking\nit on the way home. In conclusion despite what advertisers would have us\nbelieve about the bight new dawn of\nthe i-fag, very much like its brethren\nebooks, prophylactics and Prii (the\nplural of Prius \u2013 jeez, read a book),\nthe old ways are the most certainly the\nbest. \u2013 Meredith Thomas\nI chose the menthol \ufb02avoured E-Lite\nfor two important reasons: 1) The\npacket was green 2) Menthol is kind\nof a goth thing, so I felt I owed it to\nmy subculture. When I smoke, which\nisn\u2019t often, I really want my nicotine\nthe very instant I start smoking. Finding my lighter and igniting the damn\nthing is as much of a delay as I can\ntolerate, so I really don\u2019t appreciate having to coax the cigarette into life by sucking on\nit until it warms up. Nobody wants to feel like\na \ufb02u\ufb00er from a 1970\u2019s\nporn studio.\nOther than that, the\nonly real complaint I have\nis that I found myself incapable of putting it down.\nThey\u2019re supposed to be\nhealthier, but not\nwhen you have the\nsudden ability to\nsmoke anywhere\nand at any time.\nIn the week and\na half before\nit ran out of\npu\ufb00 (chortle),\nI think I probably took in\naround three\ntimes my usual\nlevel of nicotine.\nDon\u2019t get me\nwrong, these\nthings are awe-some, and I\u2019m\nstarting to\nwonder how\nI ever went to\nthe library\nwithout one,\nbut it\u2019s just not the same\nas a real c i g a re tte .\nThere\u2019s no feeling of\nw a r m t h , there\u2019s no\nfeeling of tr iumph\nas you dis- play your\nmastery of \ufb01re, and,\nmost impor- t a n t l y ,\nit doesn\u2019t look nearly as\ncool. \u2013Frank Machin\nIf you are a smoker and wish to\nquit, visit http://smokefree.nhs.uk/ for\nmore information and help.\nFrank Machin\nMeredith Thomas\nFelix writers\n\n"

As part of the anti-Vietnam\nWar militant Weather Underground,\nSharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) was\nwanted for a bank robbery that resulted in murder a few decades ago.\nHer arrest leads to the sharp, ambitious young reporter Ben Shepard\n(Shia LaBeouf) to do his own digging\nThe Sundance Kid goes running\nJohn Park Film Editor\nBlack Rock\nDirector: Katie Aselton\nScreenwriters: Mark Duplass, Katie\nAselton\nStarring: Katie Aselton, Lake Bell,\nKate Bosworth\naround the terrorist group Solarz was\ninvolved in. His investigation leads to\nJim Grant (Robert Redford), a lawyer\nhiding out in Albany under an alias.\nLeaving his young daughter (Jackie\nEvancho) with his brother (Chris\nCooper) who is less than thrilled to\nbe in contact with him, Grant goes\non the run, although Ben is determined to get a story out of this due\nto his pushy editor\u2019s (Stanley Tucci)\ninsistence.\nWhat exactly is Grant after? To\nclear his name, maintain his inno-cence, and the only person who can\ndo this is the elusive Mimi Lurie\n(Julie Christie) with whom he shared\nsomething special back in the day.\nThis little reunion between the two is\ndelayed for far too long as we see far\ntoo much of Ben\u2019s investigative jour-nalism. There isn\u2019t anything wrong\nwith showing us the methods, the\nkeen reporter doing whatever he can\nto \ufb01nd a story he can print, but it\u2019s\noften what he discovers that\u2019s of little\ninterest. There are children involved,\nadoption, paternity issues, but these\ndon\u2019t contribute to the overall narra-tive. It only slows down and distracts\nus from what\u2019s truly important.\nOnce Jim and Mimi do end up in\nthe same room, it leads to a heartfelt,\nintelligent discussion about their val-ues, beliefs and ideals \u2013 what they believed so passionately in the 70s don\u2019t\nquite hold the same weight in the\ncurrent context. Another theme that\ncrops up is whether there is any re-gret, remorse or guilt about past ac-tions. Whatever they do or don\u2019t feel\ncan\u2019t excuse their actions, the characters know this too, and the heated\nexchange between the two, although\nbrief, is a deep, insightful one: a worthy wrap-up of preceding events.\nAside from those already men-tioned, other big names in the cast\nappearing include Brendan Gleeson,\nTerrence Howard, Anna Kendrick,\nNick Nolte, Richard Jenkins, Sam\nElliott and Brit Marling. Do they all\nserve a purpose to further the story\nor are they merely a distraction?\nThey end up as a little bit of both,\nwith understated performances all-round contributing to this greatly\nrestrained piece.\nIt\u2019s not as informative or powerful as Redford\u2019s previous politically\ndriven picture, the highly underrated\nand underseen Lions for Lambs, but\nthe appeal here is still huge, starting with the stars, its opening, and a\nneat \ufb01nish that successfully plays on\nthe chemistry between Redford and\nChristie.\nIt\u2019s a shame the middle \ufb01lling isn\u2019t\nquite as gripping as it should have\nbeen. It could have been shorter, and\nthe many famous names should have\nbeen put to better use.\nThere\u2019s something almost primeval\nabout the way the characters here\nconduct themselves. Cut o\ufb00 from\ncivilisation with no technology to\nhelp them, the women here need to\nresort to the bare minimum to stay\nalive, and here is a gritty, un\ufb02inching\nsurvival drama that is impressively\nmade, with brisk action and nasty\nsurprises here and there.\nWhen three female childhood\nfriends decide to go away together on\na camping trip, they put their di\ufb00erences aside and try their best to have\na good time. Something about sleeping with the wrong man put some\nawkward tension between Abby\n(Katie Aselton) and Lou (Lake Bell)\nwhereas the one caught between the\ncon\ufb02ict, Sarah (Kate Bosworth), is\nplaying peace-keeper among the trio.\nDespite some explosive verbal argu-ments, the trio\u2019s lives are at least safe,\nuntil they run into three men: Henry\n(Will Bouvier) Derek (Jay Paulson)\nand Alex (Anslem Richardson), all of\nthem seemingly harmless at \ufb01rst, but\nwhen one of them can\u2019t take an ultimate \u201cno\u201d as an answer at the end of\nsome full-on \ufb02irtation, all hell breaks\nloose.\nThe men have guns (actual \ufb01ring\nguns, not referring to their anatomy\nhere), the women have nothing, except possibly some knowledge about\nthe island they\u2019re on. It\u2019s an impossible situation but the game is on,\nand they need to \ufb01ght to even have\na chance to get o\ufb00 the remote island\nalive. Everything escalates beautifully up to this point, and there is\ngenuine worry and concern as to just\nhow the three of them will be coming\nout on top in this ridiculously out-matched scenario.\nAnd as with many thrillers carrying this kind of synopsis, it\u2019s inevitable that some characters make silly\ndecisions and do some downright\nbizarre things that you know will get\nthem killed at some point. Despite\ntheir lives being at risk, they \ufb01nd the\ntime to talk about the unresolved elephant in the room \u2013 and manage to\n\ufb01nd closure whilst covered in blood,\ncuts and bruises. But with stupidity\ncomes a body count, which isn\u2019t an\nentirely bad thing.\nBy the time you see the plot resolv-ing, there will have been a decent\namount of fun, some brutal \ufb01ghts,\nand a satisfying conclusion that\ndoesn\u2019t o\ufb00er any deadly last-minute\ntwists, but a wholly acceptable one\nnonetheless.\nShit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit\nHold on to your ovaries girls...Man of Steel lands today\n\n"

    "content": "The Space Merchants\nMaciej Matuszewski looks at a classic of the SF genre\nhere is often a stigma attached to early works of\nscience \ufb01ction (SF). They\nare often stereotyped as\nbeing poorly written and\n\ufb01lled with bad science and bug-eyed\nmonsters. While true for some works\nthis is by no means universally the\ncase. Early SF laid the groundwork for\nwhat the genre is today and it includes\nsome of the most imaginative and\nthought provoking works of \ufb01ction\never written.\nThat is why I was very pleased to\nhear of the recently released two volume collection of nine classic 1950s\nSF novels released by the Library of\nAmerica. Each novel is a brilliant example of the strengths of the genre\nand one of the best works in the selection is undoubtedly Frederik Pohl\nand Cyril M. Kornbluth\u2019s The Space\nMerchants.\nThe novel is set in the near future\nwhere the world is controlled by giant\ncorporations, and in particular advertising \ufb01rms. Companies openly buy\nout and bribe politicians; workers are\ntrapped in menial jobs, in which they\nare treated like slaves, by unfair contracts and the planet has been ravaged\nfor its natural resources. The \u201chighest\nideals\u201d in society are considered to be\nsales and pro\ufb01t \u2013 with anybody who\ndisagrees with this philosophy being\ntreated as either hopelessly deluded or\na dangerous subversive.\nThis is a world similar to those we\noften see in modern works of cyberpunk but Pohl and Kornbluth took the\nunusual step of making the protagonist someone near the top of the corporate hierarchy rather than near the\nbottom. Mitch Courtenay is a senior\nexecutive at the Fowler Schocken advertising agency, assigned to oversee\nthe planned colonization of Venus. He\nis no subversive and fully endorses the\nideals of his society yet he remains a\nrelatable and, at times, even a sympathetic character. He is our guide to this\nfrightening yet familiar world and his\ngrowth as a person forms the core of\nthis work.\nThrough his eyes, we get to understand how the system described in\nthe book works and how strongly entrenched it is. We see how the elite \u2013\neven those who consider themselves\ngood and moral people \u2013 remain committed to their highly \ufb02awed model of\nsociety. This is not merely as a result of\nself interest but also because \u2013 through\nsocietal pressure, wilful blindness and\ntheir own propaganda \u2013 they honestly\nbelieve that current system is best for\neveryone.\nWhile the prose is somewhat dry \u2013\nas is common with genre novels from\nthat time \u2013 this is more than compensated for by the interesting characters\nand important issues that form the\nheart of the work. Despite being written more than 50 years ago the book\nretains a remarkable relevance. At under 200 pages this is a short yet powerful novel \u2013 there\u2019s no excuse for not\nchecking it out.\nT\nNoted author Iain Banks has died\naged 59. In a message released on Sunday, June 9, his wife said: \u201cIain died\nin the early hours this morning. His\ndeath was calm and without pain.\u201d\nBorn in 1954 Banks \ufb01rst rose to\nprominence in 1984 with the publication of his debut novel The Wasp\nFactory. Following the mentally troubled Frank Cauldhame the book both\nimpressed and shocked critics by how\nit managed to make the reader sym-pathise with the violent protagonist.\nA highly proli\ufb01c writer Banks was\nalso known for his works of science\n\ufb01ction (SF), written under the name\nIain M. Banks. The majority of his SF\nbooks were set in the Culture universe \u2013 a highly optimistic vision of\na technologically advanced utopia.\nWhile often classi\ufb01ed as space opera\nand known for their high stakes and\nlarge scale plots his SF novels, just as\nhis more mainstream work, were also\nnotable for their focus on complex\nand well developed characters.\nTributes for the author have poured\nin from both fans and colleagues ever\nsince he announced on April 4 that\nhe had inoperable cancer of the gall\nbladder. Writing in The Guardian\nfriend and fellow author Ken Macleod\nsaid that Banks \u201craised the bar, raised\nthe game, and above all raised the serotonin level of British SF\u201d adding that\n\u201chis verve and talent will always be\nrecognised, and his work will always\n\ufb01nd and enthral new readers\u201d.\nBanks\u2019 \ufb01nal work \u2013 the mainstream\nnovel The Quarry \u2013 will be released\non June 20.\nDeath of an icon \u2013 Iain Banks\nMaciej Matuszewski Books Editor\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 14 JULY\n24\n\n"

BSc (Hons) Ost\nThe Union Council this week unanimously passed a paper opposing plans\nby a number of UK universities to\nreplace the current system of degree\nclassi\ufb01cation with US style grade point\naverages (GPA). The group of twelve\nuniversities \u2013 including King\u2019s College London and UCL, but not Imperial \u2013 \ufb01rst published their plans in June\n2011. The new system would involve\nstudents being assigned letter grades\nfor each piece of assessment. Each\ngrade would be assigned a numerical\nvalue between 0.00 and 4.25 with the\n\ufb01nal grade being a weighted average of\nthese numerical values.\nThe Union Council, however, rejected arguments that the GPA was\nsuperior to the current system since\nit is better understood internationally\nand provides more information to potential employers. Instead the Council\nraised the point that the GPA would\nlead to a greater focus on marks rather\nthan learning course material. This\nwould further lead to more stress for\nstudents and might encourage some to\ntake easier modules. It was also pointed out that introducing a new system\nwould lead to more confusion. The\ncurrently proposed system would be\nparticularly confusing as it would go\nup to 4.25 and not 4.00, as is the case in\nmost US universities, and it would not\n\u201calign itself with the one for A-levels,\nwhich is letter grade and percentages\u201d.\nThe passed paper states that the\nGPNAY \u2013 Union Council unanimously\nopposes the GPA\nUnion believes that \u201cImperial College\nLondon should keep the traditional\nBritish degree class marking system\u201d\nand that \u201cswitching to a GPA marking system would be a misuse of College resources\u201d. The Council resolved\nto inform both the College and the\ngroup of universities which favour the\nchange that the Imperial \u201cstudent body\nopposes a GPA marking system\u201d.\nSpeaking to Felix Debra Humphris,\nPro Rector (Education), con\ufb01rmed\nthat there had so far been no discussions in College about changing the\ndegree classi\ufb01cation system.\nMaciej Matuszewski Reporter\nOne of the letters sent to Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions praised the service and \u201csuperb care\u201d o\ufb00ered and said that the\nwriter was \u201csurprised and dismayed\u201d\nto hear the eviction and hoped the\n\u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201c\ufb02awed decision\u201d would\nbe changed. The letter went on to suggest the optician could move, saying:\n\u201cIt seems anyway rather odd that so\nsmall a space should apparently make\nsuch a di\ufb00erence to your plans for\nexpansion \u2013 if this particular space\nis indeed so very vital could you not\n\ufb01nd room elsewhere on campus for\nVision@SW7?\u201d\nKhambalia told Felix: \u201cAll sta\ufb00 and\nstudents who are \ufb01nding out about\nthe closure are absolutely up in arms\nabout it.\u201d Khambalia said that the\npractice have no local area to relocate\nto at the present time.\nThe opticians has been there since\n2000 and was bought by Vision at SW7\nthree years ago in a private deal with\nthe previous owners.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editors: Jason Parmar\nMaximilian Eggl\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nApple iOS7\nMax Eggl coos over iPhone\u2019s latest mobile OS\nFRIDAY 14 JUNE 33\npple has \ufb01nally caught\nup with the rest of the\nmobile OS world. The\nkeynote at WWDC has\nrevealed a slew of new\nfeatures, and yours truly has access to\nthe beta to test them out for you, my\ndear reader. A little disclaimer, since\nI only have beta access, my experience may not be the same as the \ufb01nal\nproduct. I found that the music app is\nquite buggy, crashing several times.\nHowever, all in all, the beta is already\nquite smooth, with very few major\nproblems. Now to the actual review.\nKeep in mind I will only be reviewing\nthings I myself used on a major basis\nand found important.\nDesign\nAll previous iOS versions, right from\nthe very start, were dripping with\nskeuomorphism (i.e. making programs look like their real life equivalents \u2013 for example, notes looks like a\nyellow notepad) a favourite of ex-de-sign chief Scott Forstall. But when he\nwas \ufb01red, and Sir Jonny Ive installed\nin his stead, a lot of critics hoped for\na more updated look in iOS 7. Ive,\nan award winning designer, who was\npreviously solely in charge of the hardware design, was, and still is a known\nlover of simplicity, straight lines and a\n\u201c\ufb02at\u201d look as is exhibited in the iMac,\niPhone etc. Therefore, the consensus\non the internet was that Ive would try\nto apply this approach to the software\nthat ran the devices he designed. And,\nboy, did he deliver. Right from the\nloading screen his in\ufb02uence is felt, all\nthe way to the absence of the felt texture of the folders. However this just\nfeels \u201cright\u201d. Apple device\u2019s futuristic\nlook clashed with the green felt and\nfaux leather of previous software it-erations.\nThe new lock screen just emphasises\nthe beauty of the retina display, with\nno more grey bars in the way. Then\nwhen the lock screen gives way to the\nhome screen, the animation looks just\n(sorry for the clich\u00e9) awesome. The\nnew designs of the app icons, without\nthe shadowing, are just great to look\nSexy screenshots from iOS 7: \u201cControl Center\u201d, \u201cNotes\u201d, \u201cUnlock Screen\u201d\nAt a time\nwhen\nconfidence\nin Apple has\nbeen failing,\nthey have\nreleased a\nmuch needed\nboost\nat and much more modern. An added\ntouch that does speak volumes of Ive\u2019s\ncreativity and attention to detail is the\nopaqueness of various messages and\nscreens. This means that your home/\nlockscreen really a\ufb00ect the look of\nyour phone as the colours do really\nbleed through. There is so much more\nI could tell you about the new design,\nhowever I would run out of space and\ntime, so I apologize if I forgot any new\ndesign features. However the last thing\nI have to mention and also the thing\nthat impressed me the most (I know,\neasily entertained), was the funky 3-D\nthing. My backscreen that moved depending on my viewing angle was just\ngreat! That touch was just something I\nfound to be absolutely stunning, and\nthe \ufb01rst thing everyone asked to see.\nOne con I just wanted to utter was\nthat I found that when I \ufb01rst saw the\nactual icons, while nice, I thought that\nthe added colour palette did make it\nfeel a bit less serious. However I guess\nthat was just the new experience of it\nall.\nAll in all the design is exactly what\nApple needed to do and is a great way\nto start o\ufb00 the Jonny Ive era.\nUtilities\nThere are several things that Apple\nhas \ufb01nally implemented features that\nthe world had already a long time ago\nincluding a more e\ufb03cient multitask-ing, noti\ufb01cation center, control center,\na new camera app as well as air drop.\n\u201c\nAt a time\nAt a time\nwhen\nwhe\nFirstly lets talk about the multitasking,\nin fact it\u2019s directly stolen from Windows 8. However it just looks great in\niOS 7, and works perfectly. The swiping up to quit apps is just divine and\nmuch more intuitive than tapping the\nred cross. The noti\ufb01cation center has\nbeen revamped in iOS 7, getting rid of\nthe fake texture, introducing, in black\nand white, di\ufb00erent sections for \u201ctoday\u201d, \u201coverall\u201d and \u201cmissed\u201d, that should\n\ufb01nally (hopefully) add some actual use\nto the noti\ufb01cation center. Till now it\nhasn\u2019t really done much for me. Next\non the agenda is the control center.\nThis feature, directly stolen from an-droid, is something that apple users\nhave cried for for a long time. Directly\nswiping up on your phone brings up a\nmini settings area where you can easily turn wi\ufb01, bluetooth, screen lock\netc. on and o\ufb00, and aids you in avoiding the cluttered and complex settings\napp. This a great addition to iOS 7 and\none of the reasons I decided to update\nearly. Lastly we have the camera and\nair drop. The camera has been totally\nredesigned, and now, is just a dream to\nuse. Instead of having to \ufb02ick a switch,\nor go into the settings to change camera mode, you just \ufb02ick from mode to\nmode. Also Apple have now hipster-ized the app with di\ufb00erent \ufb01lters, so\nfor all ya\u2019ll instagrammers out there\nwill certainly enjoy this. Lastly the air\ndrop. This feature seems sick! The idea\nthat I can instantly exchange \ufb01les over\nwi\ufb01 is great, however at this point I\nA\ncouldn\u2019t \ufb01nd anyone to do an iPhone\nto iPhone transfer, so future updates\non that.\nConclusion\nThis is the update that iOS really need-ed. At a time when con\ufb01dence in Apple has been failing, they have released\na much needed boost. It has given the\nageing system a new look while remaining true to the iOS roots. The\nfeatures are poignant and are what is\nneeded to keep iOS competitive.\nAll previous\niOS versions,\nright from the\nvery start, were\ndripping in\nskeuomorphism\n... a favourite of\n... Scott Forstall\n\n"

    "content": "Issue 1551\nSPORT \u201cKeep the Cat Free\u201d\nfelixonline.co.uk\n14/06/13\n@SportFelix\nWith his 100% winning record as\nskipper on the line, Vignesh Venkateswaran once again took up\nthe reins of captaincy as he led the\nICUCC 1st XI to face o\ufb00 against arch-rivals UCL, in a nail-biting London\nderby.\nConditions could not have been\nmore perfect; it was warmer outside\nthe scorebox than inside it. Once\nagain featuring a bowling-heavy line-up, Imperial won the toss and elected\nto bat \ufb01rst, with the hope of using\nscoreboard pressure to our advan-tage. Openers Iain Stobbs and Faris\nRehman took a liking to the UCL\nopening bowler, creaming him for\nboundaries down the ground. Faris\u2019s\nstay was a short one, however, giving a simple catch, which brought\nFaris Siddiqui to the crease. The situation unfortunately got the better of\nhim as he fell prey to a rash shot, attempting to heave a 6 to cow-corner\no\ufb00 his \ufb01rst delivery, only to \ufb01nd the\nball nestle comfortably in the hands\nof mid-wicket for a golden duck.\nWith the situation dire, the skipper\narrived at the crease and proceeded to rebuild the innings with Iain.\nUCL\u2019s opening bowler went through\na torrid time, leaking 35 runs o\ufb00 his\n6 overs. Boundaries arrived at regular\nintervals and the situation looked to\nhave been salvaged for a time, until\nVignesh played all around a full delivery and was cleaned up for 21 o\ufb00 30.\nSiddharth Kohli, so often the unsung\nhero with the bat, came to the middle,\nbut all he managed to do was starve\nIain of deliveries before giving a tame\ncatch.\nI was in at no. 6, and the situation\nbecame even more desperate when\nIain fell soon after to an excellent in-dipper for a solid 38 o\ufb00 37. This left\ntwo new batsmen, Nitin Nihilani and\nmyself at the crease with the bowler\nin form steaming in. After some poor\nshowings with the bat, I managed to\nplay myself back into some sort of\nform with a quick\ufb01re 14 o\ufb00 15 including 2 \ufb02icked boundaries over deep\nsquare leg and a tennis forehand to\na slow bouncer, before being run-out\nattempting a tough single to get back\non strike, with Nitin \ufb01nding it nearly\nimpossible to get bat to ball. With\nthe tail needing to wag, an in form\nGanesh \u201cBig G\u201d Kumar walked in. He\nfound the going tough as well, wafting\nat thin air outside o\ufb00-stump on multiple occasions along with Nitin. Nitin\nwas eventually put out of his misery,\ngetting bowled by no less than Du\nPlessis himself for 1 o\ufb00 36.\nA pre-match cigarette and beer\ndidn\u2019t help Johan Rekers much as got\nout as soon as he went in, bowled for a\ngolden duck, bringing debutant Rajan\nBhambra to the crease. The fact that\nhe was holding a bat for the \ufb01rst time\nin years began to show, and he was\nlucky not to give an edge on his \ufb01rst\nfew deliveries faced. Fortune favours\nthe brave, however, and he managed\nto streak an edge past slip to the 3rd\nman boundary. He, too, eventually fell\nfor 7. Farhan Huq was last man in and\nlasted 4 deliveries before being given\nout LBW for a duck. At the other end,\nBig G had made his way to 17 o\ufb00 35\nbefore running out of partners. Imperial hence folded for 128 all out, probably around 22 runs short on a turning track.\nAfter tea, the boys took to the \ufb01eld,\ndesperate to defend 128 and the skipper\u2019s winning record. Iain Stobbs\nfound himself in the unenviable position of having to open the bowling\nafter opening the batting as well. Out\nof concern for the opposition batsmen\u2019s safety, he decided to forgoe\npace, instead relying on some nifty\nswing and a 5-step run up. The plan\nworked as he immediately produced\nsome healthy edges, with Big G taking\na smart running catch over his shoulder at backward point to dismiss one\nof the UCL openers.\nBig G himself came on from the\nother end, and built up some pressure\nSports writer\nJayanth Ganapthy\nClaims of UCL using\nringers were unfounded\nwith Iain. The batsmen were not letting up, however, and eventually the\no\ufb00-spin of Siddharth was introduced.\nVignesh brought himself on from the\nother end as well, and the 2 spinners\nset about trying to rein in the run\nrate. Despite some excellent bowling\nfor most of the over, there was always\none loose ball per over that was dispatched to the boundary, which did\nnot help the cause seeing as the asking rate was only just above 3. Barring tough chances being put down\nby keeper Faris Rehman and Nitin,\nas well as a few comical moments\nwith Faris Siddiqui allowing a boundary through his legs and Johan diving\nover a ball a few feet from him, Imperial\u2019s \ufb01elding display was impecca-ble, with even clean shots stopped in\nthe in-\ufb01eld, culminating in a massive\nbuild-up of pressure on the batsmen.\nEventually they cracked, as Siddharth and Vignesh tore through the\nUCL batting line-up by themselves.\n2 of Siddharth\u2019s 4 wickets found Vignesh (at that point looking like he\ncould pluck a \ufb02y out of the air) at\nshort midwicket, and 1 of Vignesh\u2019s\n2 was taken by Siddharth at short\nextra-cover. Nitin chipped in with a\nwicket as well. In a tense \ufb01nish, UCL\nwere 8 wickets down and needed 3\nmore runs to win, but the returning\nIain gifted them with a no-ball full\ntoss o\ufb00 the \ufb01rst delivery of his second\nspell, which was sent to the boundary,\ngiving UCL the victory by 2 wickets\nwith 12 overs to spare. It was a disappointing loss for ICUCC and a \ufb01rst\nloss for Vignesh as captain, but UCL\nwill always remember the day when a\nsecond-string Imperial team made a\n128 target seem more like 328.\nICUCC beaten by UCL\nThe pressures of harder exams take their toll on a brave IC team\n\n"

They \ufb01rst\ncross paths when Scott is invited to\nmeet Liberace backstage at one of his\nsell-out concerts. Liberace takes an\nimmediate liking to Scott and it\u2019s not\nlong before they start a relationship,\nalthough given the cranky, unhappy\nstate of Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne\nJackson), a former \ufb02ame, it doesn\u2019t\nbode well for Scott\u2019s future.\nHaving grown up in a modest foster\nhome, the lavish gifts his boyfriend\nshowers on him is certainly a drastic\nchange, one Scott doesn\u2019t quite mind\ngetting used to. There\u2019s jewellery,\nthere\u2019s never-ending \ufb02ow of cham-pagne, the immaculately decorated,\ngolden-plated mansion is quite simply out of this world, and in keeping\nwith Liberace\u2019s famous saying \u201ctoo\nmuch of a good thing is wonderful,\u201d\neverything seems to appear in excess.\nThe production design and the art\ndepartment have created something\nextraordinary here, going completely overboard, as well they should, to\nshow that both on and o\ufb00 stage, there\nis very little di\ufb00erence in Liberace\u2019s\ntaste for extravagance.\nTheir relationship is riddled with\ndisturbing content as it progresses \u2013\nas we soon discover Liberace\u2019s rather\nunhealthy obsession to turn his lover\ninto an adopted son of some sorts,\npushing Scott into plastic surgery so\nthat they may share more physical re-semblance. And so we\u2019re introduced\nto Dr John Startz (Rob Lowe), a hideously dis\ufb01gured individual who has\nclearly had a taste of his own medicine a few too many times, with his\nuncomfortable looking squint, a\nby-product of many, many face-lifts,\nguaranteed to shock and make you\nthink twice about plastic surgery in\ngeneral.\nIn the lead role designed to be the\ncentre of attention at all times, Douglas is on excellent form, fully embracing the campy, extremely vibrant\nenergy of the star, and with some incredible CGI work it looks as though\nit\u2019s actually Douglas who\u2019s playing\naway at the piano when in fact it\u2019s not.\nAlways dressed in the most sparkling,\nbrightest costumes, there are lots of\nlaughs to be had in seeing a hilariously complex man, and yet there are\ntender moments of real warmth in\nscenes that show o\ufb00 Douglas\u2019 range\nand versatility.\nNevertheless there isn\u2019t a lot to immediately like about Liberace in this\n\ufb01lm; never looking closely at the\nstage persona that impressed millions\nworldwide, just by looking at the \ufb01lm\nalone it\u2019s confusing as to why this\nman is such a beloved musical icon. A\nmore balanced look would no doubt\nhave further enriched his character,\nrather than very often coming across\nas nothing but a creepy, lonely old\nman with some serious psychological\nissues.\nHistory does have its way of repeating itself it seems, as soon, passion\nsizzles and the two of them start looking elsewhere to \ufb01ll the void. For Liberace he takes a keen interest in a musical actor who shows promise (Boyd\nHolbrook), amongst other fresh-faced\nyoung men, and with Scott he turns to\ndrugs. Although left with a less showy,\nstuck-in-the-shadows type role, Damon still turns his role into something more than a mere silent victim,\nthe wronged party. There is nothing\nnew about someone involved in that\nparticular industry face a downward\nspiral due to drug addiction, but there\nis so much more to be said in the slow\nbut gradual disintegration of their\ncomplicated relationship, one that is\nconvincingly captured not only by the\nfur-wearing pianist, but also his longsu\ufb00ering partner.\nIt\u2019s a shame this missed out on its\nopportunity to screen at the cinemas\nin the States. Even with real potential\nto score some Oscar nominations and\npossibly a win for Douglas, the \ufb01lm\nis no longer eligible as it was shown\nas a television movie. So Douglas will\nhave to settle for a possible trifecta\nof an Emmy, a Golden Globe and a\nScreen Actors Guild Award, but given\nthe theatrical push it\u2019s been getting\naround Europe, it has a chance to\nreach a wider public audience this de-serves.\nIt\u2019s okay - we\u2019ll be the new Jeremy and Megan\nRocking the curtains.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 14 JUNE\n18\nS\ntatistically, approximately\none in every 100 of us will\ndevelop schizophrenia over\nthe course of our lifetimes.\nSchizophrenia is one of the\nmore commonly known mental disor-ders, but also one that remains somewhat of a mystery to non-su\ufb00erers.\nWhilst the Greek root of the word\nschizophrenia, literally \u2018split mind\u2019, implies a split personality the condition is\nmuch more than just having a second\nvoice in your head.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just have constant jabbering in your ears,\u201d explains Harriet, who\nhas lived with schizophrenia for over\na decade. \u201cThe worst thing for me is\nmy own jabbering. It can make people\nlook at you funny. You say things that\nmake no sense, and you don\u2019t even re-alise. Stu\ufb00 like \u2018cooking on the washing sofa\u2019 just comes out. Sometimes\nyou even stop mid-sentence and can\u2019t\nspeak. Everything literally vanishes.\u201d\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia can\nbe broadly grouped into negative and\npositive categories. Negative symptoms are functions which are present\nin non-su\ufb00erers, but diminished in\nsu\ufb00erers, such as apathy, social anxiety\nand reduced attention span. Positive\nsymptoms are those not normally exhibited by non-su\ufb00erers, such as visual\nand auditory hallucinations and delu-sions. However, schizophrenics are\nnot the only people who experience\nauditory hallucinations. They can even\noccur in mentally healthy individuals,\nand it\u2019s these people who may hold the\nkey to better schizophrenia manage-ment.\n\u201cIn clinical hallucinations the voices\nthemselves are very negative, entirely\nuncontrollable, and attributed to external causes. Thus, they create fear\nand are, quite simply, very annoying\nand cause su\ufb00ering,\u201d says Dr Kristiina\nKompus, a psychology researcher at\nthe University of Bergen. \u201cWhen voices\ndo not have negative content and are\nunder control, then it already becomes\nquite a neutral, not negative, experience.\u201d Dr Kompus is a member of the\nBergen fMRI (functional Magnetic\nResonance Imaging) group, headed by\nProf. Kenneth Hugdahl. The group is\ndedicated to the study of a variety of\ncognitive functions.\nHer recent research, published in\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience,\nstudied the di\ufb00erences between two\ntypes of hallucinators: those with clinical symptoms, and those without. During listening tests those without clinical symptoms were able to maintain\nregulation over brain areas dedicated\nto speech-processing, whilst those\nwith clinical symptoms could not, sug-gesting, in principle, a reduced ability\nto direct attention outwards in clinical\nsu\ufb00erers when auditory hallucinations\noccur.\nResearch by Dr Kompus and other\nmembers of the Bergen fMRI group\naims to enhance understanding of\nauditory hallucinations, with the potential to develop a \u201ccognitive training program aimed to relieve the feeling of helplessness when the negative\nvoices start bothering you again,\u201d says\nDr Kompus. This is somewhat akin\nto the use of lucid dreaming, the ability to consciously control the actions\nin one\u2019s dream, to combat persistent\nnightmares. Embracing the digital age,\nthe research group has developed an\niPhone app, iDichotic.\niDichotic is the brainchild of PhD\nstudent Josef Bless, also from the Bergen fMRI group. The app is named\nafter the listening test it runs, the di-chotic listening test. At a basic level\nthe test assesses which hemisphere of\nthe brain is most active during language processing. The information\nthen feeds back to the research team,\nallowing them to further their work. A\npaper based o\ufb00 the initial results was\npublished last February in Frontiers\nin Cognition, but according to Josef\n\u201cthere is a lot more to come.\u201d\nThough the public version of iDi-chotic currently only collects data\nanother separate version has been developed to help schizophrenics manage their condition by improving their\nfocus, allowing them to better identify when voices occur. It is pioneering\nwork, and still requires modi\ufb01cation,\nbut Josef hopes to \u201cprovide a cognitive\ntraining tool for patients that can be\nused anytime, anywhere, without having stigmatizing features when used in\npublic.\u201d\nIf the iDichotic app performs well it\nmay pave the way for future research\nand management of other mental disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s. Whilst Josef importantly notes that \u201cit does take\na strong investigative e\ufb00ort to provide\npsych apps with a real scienti\ufb01c basis,\u201d\nhe also notes that the \u201cpotential to use\nsmartphone apps in research as well\nas in clinical contexts is huge,\u201d potentially allowing research groups to both\ncollect data and provide ways to help\nsu\ufb00erers like Harriet manage their\nconditions through a widely available\nmedium.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve mostly got it [schizo-phrenia] under some sort of control,\u201d\nsays Harriet. \u201cBut things can obviously\nget worse with age, so I\u2019m prepping\njust in case things go downhill. Maybe\na smartphone app can help. It\u2019s an interesting idea, since everyone has one\n[a smartphone]. Support in whatever\nform is always appreciated.\u201d\nFind more about iDichotic at dichot-iclistening.com\nDOI: 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00144\nDOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00042\nBanishing your demons\nA fishy free-for-all at the O.K. Corral\nPhoto credit: Alex Craven\nThe hidden secrets of coral reefs\nCoral reefs are one of the wonders\nof the marine world: vast underwater structures supporting a large and\ndiverse ecosystem of marine species.\nIt\u2019s surprising then that until recently\nwe knew very little about exactly how\nthey form.\nCorals are colonies of small marine\ninvertebrates, and it is their calcium\ncarbonate exoskeletons that form the\ndistinctive structures we know as coral reefs. These are made from proteins\nsecreted by the living coral organisms\nin a process called biomineralization.\nHowever, the exact structures and\nmechanisms involved were unknown.\nResearchers at the Rutgers Institute\nof Marine and Coastal Sciences aimed\nto solve this mystery by studying the\ngenomes of corals. They were able\nto identify four unique genes, which\ncoded for proteins called CARPs\n(coral acid-rich proteins). These could\nthen be puri\ufb01ed and analysed to understand their structure and prop-erties. The researchers also showed\nthat, at least in an \u2018arti\ufb01cial seawater\u2019\nenvironment created in the lab, the\nCARPs catalysed the formation of calcium carbonate crystals. From these\nresults they were able to propose hypotheses about exactly how the structural elements of the protein cause\nformation of the particular crystalli-sation patterns characteristic of coral\ngrowth. Similar genes were also found\nin the genomes of other biomineral-izing species, suggesting that there is\na common mechanism emerging from\nthe species\u2019 shared evolutionary his-tory.\nThe arti\ufb01cial seawater experiments\nalso allowed the researchers to simulate di\ufb00erent scenarios, e.g. what\nwould happen if seawater became signi\ufb01cantly more acidic \u2013 the expected\noutcome of climate change and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nEncouragingly, it appears that the proteins are relatively robust and able to\nwithstand changes in acidity, suggest-Science writer\nSarah Byrne ing that corals might in fact be able to\nadapt to changing conditions in the\nfuture. Of course acidity is only part of\nthe story: we still have rising temperatures and ocean pollution to worry\nabout, and Tali Mass, the lead author\nof the published \ufb01ndings, warns that\nwe should not become complacent.\nAdditionally, the researchers suggest\na practical application for the \ufb01ndings\n\u2013 that an improved understanding of\nhow corals construct their reefs could\nhelp us devise methods to manufacture novel biomaterials ourselves.\nCoral-derived materials currently\nhave applications from road surfacing\nto bone grafts, and understanding the\nmechanisms of production better may\nallow us to design and customise materials according to our requirements,\njust as corals have been doing for over\n100 million years.\nDOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2013.05.007\nLaurence PopedelvesintotheworldofschizophreniaandiPhoneapps\nMembers of the Bergen fMRI group (from left): Prof. Kenneth Hugdahl, Dr\nKristiina Kompus, Josef Bless, Magne Gudmundsen, Dr Ren\u00e9 Westerhausen\ncommons.wikimedia.org\n\n"

This might be true\nfor some places, though this article\nwill present some nature\u2019s most famous creations, namely the Canyons\nand the national parks within which\nthey are located.\nYes, most of you I am sure know\nabout the Grand Canyon, that is why\nI am going to omit it from this article,\nand will try to shed some light to those\nleast known ones, which I truly admired on my trip there.\nThe US states where most of these\ncanyons can be found are Arizona,\nUtah and Nevada. The \ufb01rst one I am\ngoing to mention is Bryce Canyon located in Utah within the Kodachrome\nState Park. At this canyon one has the\nopportunity to stay within the State\nPark in the so called \u201cRed Stone\u201d Cabins. You can then admire the magnitude of this canyon throughout different times of the day and notice the\nchange in the colour of the rocks. One\ncan walk through the di\ufb00erent designated paths to understand what this\nplace has to o\ufb00er and admire what\nnature has created, and see something\nthat is still pretty un-in\ufb02uenced from\nhumans. The scenery is truly majestic.\nNatalia Petrou Writer\nTO THE FAR\nWEST AND\nBEYOND\nI am not particularly fond of adventure\ntrips, but this place brought out a different site of me.\nThe next one on my list is Zion National Park, also located in Utah, which\nis one of the longest canyons covering\na distance of 24 km. The rangers in the\npark have organised buses that take\nyou from the visitor center to the end\nof the trail at the so called \u201cTemple of\nSinawava\u201d. At each stop along the way\none can get o\ufb00 the bus and follow the\ndesignated trails to experience nature\u2019s\nmagnitude \ufb01rst hand. This canyon is\nthe easiest one to reach and explore,\nespecially for a beginner hiker.\nThe \ufb01nal canyon that has literally\nblown my mind is the \u201cAntelope Canyon\u201d, located in Page Arizona. What is\nstriking about this canyon is that it is\nlocated under the ground. One can enter this canyon only with a guide, who\nalso explains how it was created and\ntries to really integrate you into the\nscenery. Truth is this canyon is completely di\ufb00erent any other canyon that\nI have visitied, and is worth a look.\nWords really fail me when describing\nthis canyon; I think for once I will let\npictures speak for themselves.\nIn these places don\u2019t expect to \ufb01nd\nextreme luxuries, but expect to be\namazed by nature\u2019s luxuries. If you\nwant to escape the humdrum of everyday hectic life, then these places are\nideal for you and for your hidden adventurous site\u2026\nLoukas Petrou Loukas Petrou\nLoukas Petrou\nNatalia Petrou\nNatalia Petrou\nKodachrome\nKodachrome\nKodachrome\nZion National Park\nZion National Park\nKodachrome\n\n"

These show that\nfor the 2011-2012 academic year only\n62.7% of new entrants to the College\ncame from a state school \u2013 compared\nto a 88.5% average for all English universities \u2013 and only 15.5% belonged\nto the four poorest National Statistics\nSocio-Economic Classes (NS-SEC \u2013\nsee box on right) \u2013 this is compared to\na 30.7% average for England. The College also falls short of HESA\u2019s benchmark \ufb01gures \u2013 the percentages of students from backgrounds in the lowest\nNS-SEC category \u2013 which could be\nexpected given factors such as Imperial\u2019s location and the courses that it\no\ufb00ers. These benchmarks are 74.5% of\nnew entrants from state schools and\n17.1% of new entrants from the lowest\nNS-SEC.

He\nadded that, in his personal opinion:\n\u201cThe College has one of the most generous cash-in-hand \ufb01nancial support\npackages in the country. The National\nScholarship Program requires that\n\u00a35k of the bursary must be in \u2018service\ndiscounts\u2019 rather than cash in hand,\nwhich the College very nicely gives\nstudents in their \ufb01rst year (when they\ncan cash this in on their accommoda-tion), and then provided \u00a350 million\nto the initiative, which will rise to\n\u00a3100 million in 2013/14 and \u00a3150 million in 2014/15 gives \u00a31k cash in their\n\ufb01rst year, and \u00a36k cash for years after.\nMost other universities waive fees,\nwhich does nothing to help students\nwhilst they\u2019re at university: they need\nthe cash there and then.\u201d He went on\nto say: \u201cThe College is also discussing\nother ways in which students will be\nable to spend their service discount\nin the future, if they so choose. Some\nconsiderations at the minute are being\nable to put the money towards clubs\nand societies, as most students complain that the thing that they miss out\non the most are clubs and societies\nactivities.\u201d There has, as yet, been no\no\ufb03cial Union response to the \ufb01gure.\nSpeaking to Felix Dr Melanie Bottrill, Scienti\ufb01c Projects Manager in\nImperial\u2019s Outreach O\ufb03ce, said: \u201cThe\nOutreach team at Imperial works really hard across the calendar year\nto deliver a wide range activities for\nprospective students. This year we\nexpect to interact with over 11,000\nschool students though our activities\non campus, such as summer schools\nand other funded enrichment courses.\nIn addition, we do all sorts of work\nwithin schools, such the Pimlico con-nection, Postgraduate Ambassadors\nScheme, Inspire and our school visits\nprogramme. Our activity is much wider reaching than I think most people\nrealise. Rarely a day passes without an\nactivity happening on campus or without one us being within a school, so\nwe are a really busy team \u2013 and we are\nbrilliantly supported by all the UG and\nPG students who work on our programmes as mentors or volunteers.\n\u201cWith the new fee regime, the demand for our programmes has grown\nand prospective students want more\nopportunities for support and information from universities. This is the\n\ufb01rst full academic year (12/13) of the\nnew fees, and the College has set aside\npart of this income to signi\ufb01cantly\nexpand our outreach programmes\naimed at academically able, but disadvantaged prospective students.\u201d\nIn its access agreement \u2013 a document all universities charging more\nthan \u00a31,345 per student must submit\nto OFFA \u2013 the College pledges to\n\u201cspend at least 35% of additional fee\nincome\u201d on bursaries and outreach\nactivities. Additionally, \u201cthe College\ncommits to increase expenditure on\noutreach activities by at least \u00a3550K\nonce all undergraduate cohorts are on\nthe new fee system\u201d.\nDr Bottrill added: \u201cThe biggest challenge that is faced by the College, in\nmy opinion, is the small pool of prospective students who \ufb01t the criteria\nof being able and interested in STEM\nsubjects, but of a widening participation background. To increase this\nnumber, we need to be supporting\nthese students much earlier in their\nschool careers. If we can inspire students early in their school careers\nabout STEM subjects helping them\nstay within this \ufb01eld, then the number\nof prospective students for Imperial\nwill grow.\u201d\nSpeaking to the Daily Telegraph\nWendy Piatt, director general of the\nRussell Group of elite research uni-versities, said: \u201cOur universities put a\nlot of e\ufb00ort into trying to help solve\nthese problems but we cannot do so\nalone. Outreach work, including summer schools and mentoring, can be\nsuccessful at inspiring students from\na wide variety of backgrounds to apply to a range of universities and has\nan important role to play. But no-one\ncan guarantee that those students will\ngo on to apply successfully to Russell\nGroup universities. It remains important that admission to university is\nbased on merit and fairness to all can-didates; any decisions about admissions must maintain high academic\nstandards.\u201d\nThe Government\u2019s response to the\nOFFA and HEFCE report has focused\nmainly on the positives. In particular,\nministers pointed out the e\ufb00ectiveness of the recently introduced National Scholarship Programme. In an\no\ufb03cial press release the Secretary of\nState for Business, Vince Cable said:\n\u201cI have always said that going to university should be about ability, not\nability to pay. So it\u2019s encouraging that\nthe National Scholarship Programme\nhas helped more than 35,000 students\nfrom poor backgrounds in its \ufb01rst\nyear. This has been supported by over\n\u00a3130 million investment from government and institutions.\u201d\nUniversities and Science Minister David Willetts added: \u201cThis report highlights how our reforms are\nputting students at the heart of the\nsystem. We are making progress in\nensuring talented people from disadvantaged backgrounds make it to uni-A \u00a3650 million medical research centre\nis under construction in London. Funded\nby the Medical Research Council, Cancer Research UK, the Welcome Trust as\nwell as Imperial College London, University College London and King\u2019s College London. The Francis Crick Institute\nwill be based in King Cross next to St\nPancras International station and will\nopen in 2015.\nThe institute will have 1,500 staff, including 1,250 scientists, and an annual\nbudget of about \u00a3120million. The biomedical super-laboratory aims to attract\nthe \u2018brightest and best\u2019 as it will launch\na global search for new talent to conduct\nthe research into cancer, the immune system and infectious diseases.\nIt has been named in honour of Francis\nCrick, whose work identified the structure of DNA and won him and two colleagues the Nobel Prize in Physiology or\nMedicine in 1962.\nNobel prize-winning scientist Sir Paul\nNurse, director of the institute, spoke to\nNature about the new centre. He said that\nthe quality of the employees will have a\nhuge impact as they are the \u2018people who\nmove the needles\u2019. He says that the major role of the Crick centre is to act as a\nsource of high-quality talent to support\nbiomedical research effort throughout\nthe country.\nSir Paul said: \u201cWe support the scientist\nand the other institutions that take them,\nso they get a flying start to their career.\nWe will focus on the quality of the individual rather than saying, \u2018We are going\nto work on stem cells or DNA therapy\u2019.\u201d\nHe also commented on how it was\nunique to form a partnership between the\nUK\u2019s three largest funders of biomedical\nresearch and three \u201crival\u201d London uni-versities.\n\u201cWe are trying to put something in\nplace that reduces all sorts of boundaries that can get in the way of research,\u201d\nsaid Sir Paul. \u201cThe major universities in\nLondon tend to compete. Here it\u2019s the\nopposite. They have all got together to\nsupport this endeavour. It\u2019s a major contribution to London science.\u201d\nThe Francis Crick Institute will not\nhave the clinical facilities for the research and will depend on the three universities for this. One of the themes is to\npursue multidisciplinary research in both\nthe clinical and physical science setting.\nSir Paul said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re also trying\nto do is have a culture where the investigator will look beyond the research\nthey\u2019re doing, into how it can be used.\nThat will apply to universities but it will\nalso apply to the National Health Service\n(NHS) and also to the pharmaceutical\nand biotech industries.\u201d\nAemun Reza\nGlobal biomedical hub\nto be built\nin London\nversity. This year the proportion of applications for the most disadvantaged\n18 year olds was at its highest level\never but we are not complacent, more\nneeds to be done.\u201d\nThe Labour Party, however, insists\nthat current e\ufb00orts by the Government are not enough. Policies being\nconsidered by Labour include the\n\u201cidea of making lower A-level o\ufb00ers to\npoorer students\u201d. A report published\nlast week by the left leaning think\ntank the Institute for Public Policy\nResearch recommended that \u201cfunding should be shifted out of fee waivers and bursaries and into outreach\nprogrammes, which have a stronger\ntrack-record of recruiting applicants\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds\u201d\nand that \u201ca student premium should\nbe introduced of \u00a31,000 extra per student from a low-participation area or\nwho has received free school meals\u201d.\nImperial seventh lowest proportion of students from\ndeprived backgrounds\nFACT BOX\nNS-SEC indicates the occupation of the highest-earning person in a student\u2019s household.

The report, focusing on the\n2011-2012 academic year, was generally positive about the e\ufb00orts of most\nhigher education institutions but recognised key areas for improvement.\nIn an introduction to the report Professor Les Ebdon \u2013 Direction of Fair\nAccess to Higher Education, and former Felix Editor! \u2013 commented that\nevidence showed \u201csustained improvements in participation, including for\nstudents from the most disadvantaged\nbackgrounds\u201d. The report went on to\nhighlight data showing how \u201c18 year\nolds from the most disadvantaged areas are 80 per cent more likely to apply\nto higher education in 2013 than they\nwere in 2004\u201d. Sir Alan Langlands,\nChief Executive of the HEFCE \u2013 the\nbody responsible for distributing government higher education funding\n\u2013 praised universities\u2019 bursary and\noutreach programmes, saying that \u201cin\n2011-12 the sector again committed\n\ufb01nancial resources well in excess of\nthe funding provided by HEFCE for\nwidening participation, retention and\ndisability\u201d. In total, English universities\nspend over a billion pounds a year on\noutreach activities and bursaries.\nProfessor Ebdon went on to admit,\nhowever, that \u201cthe most selective institutions have made little or no headline\nprogress in increasing access in recent\nyears\u201d. Despite year-on-year increases\nin bursary and outreach spending\nImperial College has performed particularly poorly in this regard, with\nonly 18.1% of undergraduate students\nin the 2011-2012 academic year coming from families with incomes of less\nthan \u00a325,000 a year. Only six English\nhigher education institutions (Oxford,\nCambridge, Bristol, the Couralternative site has been o\ufb00ered and\nno real explanation given except that\nthey want to increase the catering\nfacilities within the College and our\nservice does not meet the College\u2019s\nrequirements.\u201d\nKhambalia went on to say: \u201cWe have\nbeen extremely happy in the three\nyears we\u2019ve been at the College and\nfeel [like we are] part of the commu-nity.

The disproportionate\ndispersion tactics used by the\npolice catalysed an uprising in a\npopulation which has grown tired of\nbeing ignored and oppressed by the\nauthoritarian mandate of the ruling\nJustice and Development Party (AKP).\nInitially an ecological e\ufb00ort to\nprevent the demolition of the park\nin central Istanbul\u2019s historic Taksim\nSquare that intended to make way\nfor the construction of a shopping\nmall, the demonstration has come to\nsummarise a general discontent at\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s polarised politics. Many feel\nhis policies only represent the views\nof those who voted for him and ignore\nthe remainder of the electorate. The\nAKP\u2019s direction has recently deviated\nfrom its democratic agenda towards\na more conservative one which some\nfeel is attempting to impose religious\nvalues on a population that prides\nitself on its secular constitution.\nRecent laws passed under Erdo\u011fan\ninclude banning kissing in public,\nrestrictions on the sale of alcohol\nand even the colour of lipstick\nworn by airline stewardesses. Other\nmore intrusive impositions include\nprohibiting birth by Caeserian section,\nwhich Erdo\u011fan views as \u201cunnatural\u201d,\nand restricting women\u2019s right to abort.\nMany feel Erdo\u011fan\u2019s policies are a\nstep back from the modern secular\ncurrent set forth as early as the 1920s\nby the \ufb01rst President of Turkey,\nMustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, including his\nardent promotion of gender equality.\nThese sociopolitical tensions come\nas a product of the division between\na conservative Islamic majority and\na growing liberal population, which\naspires to live in a modern society free\nfrom religious indoctrination.\nThe peaceful demonstrators in\nGezi Park were surprised when in\nthe early morning of Friday 31st May,\na convoy of riot police armed with\ntear gas and pepper spray forcefully\ndispersed the crowds. These actions\nattracted more people to the park and\nsoon the campsite grew in solidarity\nagainst the heavy-handed government\nresponse. The police o\ufb00ensive grew as\nthey began dismantling the campsite,\nwhile undercover police set tents\nablaze. Tear gas canisters were shot\ninto the public, driving them out\ninto the streets where they were met\nby an assault of water cannons from\narmoured police vehicles.\nWhile the Turkish mainstream\nmedia refused to cover the protests in\nfavour of cooking shows and penguin\ndocumentaries, social media channels\nsuch as Facebook and Twitter erupted\nwith news from the ground. Tumblr\nblog occupygezipics.tumblr.com\nserved as a photographic focus on\nthe police brutality that overcame the\nstreets of Istanbul and began to blow\nacross the country. The blog di\ufb00used\ninformation on remedies against\ntear gas and provided telephone\nnumbers of doctors and the locations\nof makeshift in\ufb01rmaries. It also\nissued photos of injuries su\ufb00ered by\ndemonstrators as a result of baton\nstrikes and impacts from tear gas\ncanisters shot at point blank range,\nwhich resulted in 10 people losing\nan eye, and the death of 22-year-old\nAbdullah C\u00f6mert on Monday 3rd\nJune.\nEthem Sar\u0131s\u00fcl\u00fck was severely\nwounded after being shot in the head\nwith a live bullet by a police o\ufb03cer.\nAfter days of intensive care, he was\ncon\ufb01rmed to have su\ufb00ered brain\ndeath as a result of the injury. Police\nwere accused of hiding the identity\nof the police o\ufb03cer responsible for\ndischarging his \ufb01rearm at the crowd.\nEventually, amateur video footage\nrevealed the identity number on his\nhelmet.\nEarlierthatday,20-year-oldMehmet\nAyval\u0131ta\u015f became the \ufb01rst casualty of\nthe con\ufb02ict after being run over by a\ncivilian car, reportedly driven by an\nundercover police o\ufb03cer. At the time\nT\nTURKEY ON THE\nTIPPING POINT\nof going to print one woman remains\nin a coma after head injuries sustained\nduring the police o\ufb00ensive on the \ufb01rst\nday of peaceful demonstrations in\nGezi Park.\nPolice have shown no restraint\nin their attacks, with photographic\ncoverage showing elderly people\nbeing hit with batons and a man in\nwheelchair being blown away with\na water cannon. Other instances of\nunwarranted police aggression were\n\ufb01lmed showing o\ufb03cers shooting\ntear gas into apartments, attacking\nbystanders who were not involved\nin the protests and even destroying\nmakeshift in\ufb01rmaries. Minister\nof Health, Mehmet Muezzinoglu,\ndeclaredthatthemakeshiftin\ufb01rmaries\naround the protest areas are illegal\nand that legal action would be taken\nagainst the medics working in them,\nthough no explicit mention has been\nmade of any prosecution of the police\no\ufb03cers who raided those in\ufb01rmaries.\nBarricades were constructed around\nTaksim Square to prevent entrance\nof armoured police trucks wielding\nwater canons and, in several instances,\ndriving directly into crowds. One bus\ndriver used his vehicle as a blockade\nwhile a group of protesters rode an\nexcavator against police vehicles.\nAround Taksim Square, police\nplaced jammers preventing internet\nand 3G network connections, to\nwhich local residents responded by\nproviding free wireless access. The\nsquare became a hub of solidarity\nas a \u2018Wall of Need\u2019 was constructed\nto gather donations of food and\nother vital supplies. Homemakers\no\ufb00ered food to those in the streets\nand even to riot police during the\ncalmer moments. On Tuesday, the\nsquare burst into music as the socalled Gezi Park Philharmonic\nunited independent and orchestral\nmusicians. Across the country, people\nbegan to rebuild the fractured streets\nthat had provided defence munitions\nthe days before.\nErdo\u011fan denounced the protests\nat a press conference: \u201cThere is a\nproblem now called Twitter and\nyou can \ufb01nd every kind of lie there.\nSocial media is the biggest trouble\nfor society right now.\u201d At least 38\npeople have been arrested for posting\ntweets he claimed incited anarchy.\nHe dismissed protesters as extremists\nand looters or \u201c\u00e7apulcu\u201d, a term\nquickly re-appropriated in ironic\nde\ufb01ance against the government\u2019s\ndisinformation campaign aimed\nat devaluing their e\ufb00orts. Turkey\ncurrently holds the highest number of\nimprisoned journalists in the world,\nsurpassing China and Iran, so it is\nno wonder there has been very little\nrebellion from the media. The game\nshow \u2018Word Game\u2019 was pulled o\ufb00 air\nas host Ihsan Varol asked contestants\nto guess words such as \u2018gas mask\u2019,\n\u2018violence\u2019 and \u2018withdrawal\u2019.\nDespite the retreat of police\nforces from Taksim, confrontations\ncontinued throughout the country,\nparticularly strongly in the capital,\nAnkara. Gezi Park has become\na festive epicentre of the protest\nmovement with thousands gathering\nthere every day. This relaxation\nwas intended to appease the strong\nforeign press presence in the city:\nthe police o\ufb00ensive grew ever \ufb01ercer\nin other towns and cities where the\nlocal media still refused to cover\nthe events. If anything, violence has\ncontinued to escalate, as police has\nbegun using rubber bullets while tear\ngas launchers are continually used\nas \ufb01rearms, shot directly at people.\nAdditionally, di\ufb00erent types of tear gas\nare being used, such that the remedy\nfor one kind of tear gas aggravated the\nsymptoms of another.\nBy the night of Thursday 6th June,\nthe number of casualties had risen\nto four, now including activist Ethem\nSar\u0131s\u00fcl\u00fck (due to head injuries, in\nAnkara) and police o\ufb03cer Mustafa\nSar\u0131 (fallen from a bridge while\npursuing protesters, in Adana). More\nthan 4000 people have been injured\nsince last Friday 31st May, and many\nprotesters have been arrested. One\ngirl reported having been beaten while\nunder police custody, as evidenced by\nphotographs she posted on Twitter.\nWhile the deputy prime minister\nBulent Arin\u00e7 apologised for the\nexcessive police response against the\ninitial demonstrators, he spared the\nsentiment towards those who later\njoined the protests. Erdo\u011fan assured\nthe excessive police reaction would be\ninvestigated, though he justi\ufb01ed the\nuse of water cannons and tear gas to\ndisperse the crowds. In at least two\ninstances, however, riot police were\nseen to have covered the identi\ufb01cation\nnumber on their helmets with stickers.\nReturning from a business trip in\nNorth Africa, on which he left amidst\nblazing protests, Erdo\u011fan announced\nthat the planned demolition of\nGezi Park would go ahead. Against\naccusations of his erosion of\ndemocracy, he claimed, \u201cfor me\ndemocracy is all about the ballot box\u201d.\nPresident Abdullah Gul disagreed,\nacknowledging the protester\u2019s\nfreedom to express their views.\nOn Sunday 9th June, 73 lawyers\nwere arrested while protesting in the\nJustice Hall. Later that day, in what\nwas revealed to be an elaborate farce\nby the government, undercover police\nposing as members of the opposition\nSocialist Democracy Party (SDP)\nthrew molotov cocktails at police.\nSuspicions of the event arose after the\nmainstream media televised the entire\nevent live.\nOn the morning of Tuesday 11th\nJune, Mayor of Istanbul, H\u00fcseyin\nAvni Mutlu, wrote on Twitter that\npolice would enter Taksim Square\nto remove barricades and banners\nfrom the area, with no intention of\ndispersing protesters. However, police\nbegan by shooting tear gas into the\nsquare and eventually into Gezi Park\nitself. Clashes intensi\ufb01ed throughout\nthe day. The following day, Erdo\u011fan\nannounced that Taksim Square would\nbe cleared of all protesters within 24\nhours.\nIn an e\ufb00ort to end the protests,\nErdo\u011fan said in a press conference that\nhe would be meeting representatives\nof the Taksim Solidarity group\nto hear their demands. However,\nleaders of this group said they had\nreceived no such invitation and had\ninstead heard about the meeting\nfrom other sources. Later it was\nrevealed those \u2018representatives\u2019 would\nin fact be famous artists, including\nactress H\u00fclya Av\u015far, presenter of the\ntelevision show Turkey\u2019s Got Talent,\nwho supposedly has not been in Gezi\nPark since the demonstrations begun.\nThe consensus among demonstrators\nin the park is that those invited to\nmeet the prime minister are not well\nsuited to represent their views.\nErdo\u011fan has refused to hold early\nelections, reminding of the fair\ndemocratic proceedings which have\ngranted him a decade in o\ufb03ce. As\nwith many of the Arabic countries\nwhich have recently seen popular\nrevolts against their governments,\nthe opposition in Turkey remains too\nfragmented to convincingly contest\nthe established leadership. Indeed,\nprotesters have united not only over\npolitical di\ufb00erences, but in demand\nof basic civil rights such as freedom\nof the press, respect for individual\nliberties, restriction of police power\nand, certainly, respect for Gezi Park\nas a place of gathering. As long as\nErdo\u011fan refuses to listen to the people\nin Gezi Park and across the country,\nthe public resistance will only grow\nstronger in its determination to \ufb01ght\nfor a digni\ufb01ed democracy.\nAll photos: occupygezipics.tumblr.com\nWater cannons used by the police\nA young woman is pepper sprayed as police break up\nthe peaceful demonstration in Gezi Park, Istanbul\nPolice show no restraint against peaceful demonstrators\nTurkish mainstream media refused to cover the protests\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 14 JUNE\n26\netween a live date in Oto\nas a duo and another in\na large ensemble with\nOren Ambarchi, I was\nable to grab an interview\nwith Australian musucians James\nRushford and Joe Talia. Aside from\nmy aiming for an inside scoop about\nthe night\u2019s rendition of \u2018Knots\u2019 (from\nAmbarchi\u2019s Audience Of One), we\nprimarily discuss their work as a duo.\nand especially their 2013 album Manhunter.\nRiaz Agahi: How does tonight\u2019s version of \u2018Knots\u2019 di\ufb00er from the re-cord? Is it expanded?\nJoe Talia: It\u2019s probably not expanded\nfrom the record, but it\u2019s di\ufb00erent. I\u2019m\nplaying drums tonight and I played\ndrums on the record. Oren and I have\nThis Week At Oto: Rushford & Talia\nRiaz Agahi speaks to duo and Ambarchi collaborators\nplayed a lot as a duo, without the other\nguys. So that part of it, the interplay\nbetween the guitar and the drums has\nactually evolved a lot since the record-ing. The recording was actually done\nquite a long time ago, before we actually played all the shows. That element\nof it is de\ufb01nitely changed and has\nbroadened a lot.\nJames Rushford: For the strings arrangement I more or less transcribed\nEyvind Kang\u2019s part but there are al-terations. There are certain sections\nthat are a little more improvisatory\nand just the nature of the way those\ninstruments interact with the ensemble is a bit more energetic I suppose in\nthe performance.\nRA: How long have you guys been\nworking together?\nB\nJT: Since 2009? I think it [was when]\n\ufb01rst record came out\nRA: I haven\u2019t really been able to\nget my hands on any earlier work,\nand when I turned on Manhunter I\nwas expecting noise to be honest. I\nthought it was interesting you created a dark atmosphere without going straight to noise which made it\nmore suspenseful. What exactly did\nyou do on the album, as in what instruments did you use?\nJR: It\u2019s deliberately obscure. So, a lot\nof things that sound like synthesis-ers, for instance, are generally really\ninstruments. There\u2019s a lot of acoustic\ninstrumentation on the record. We\nwanted to make something using the\nstudio we had available to us and we\nalso wanted to make something very\ndi\ufb00erent to the last 2 records. So we\ndeliberately didn\u2019t play instruments\nthat we\u2019re usually familiar with or\ncomfortable with.\nJT: Yeah, everything\u2019s not our usual\nmode.\nRA: Wire\u2019s review of the album compared the album to the Twin Peaks\nsoundtrack. Is that something that\nwas in your head at all at the time?\nBoth: Not at all.\nJT: I mean, of course we\u2019ve seen Twin\nPeaks, but we weren\u2019t trying to do a\nTwin Peaks theme or anything.\nJR: it\u2019s just a shame that people make\na reference to Twin Peaks whenever\nthey hear any kind of synthesizer with\na certain tone or chord progression. I\nthink it wasn\u2019t in our heads at all, you\nknow? I think If anything if you wanna\nmake a reference it\u2019s closely tied to\nsay, Broken Flag issues like Maurizio\nBianchi from the \u201880s. That, for me,\nis much more linked to the album we\nmade than Twin Peaks. But we do love\nthe Twin Peaks soundtrack, like most\npeople.\nRA: I think it\u2019s just wishful thinking on people\u2019s part. But in a way,\nthere\u2019s a sort of darkly comedic but\nalso bleak and just all out weird ambience in Lynch\u2019s material that also\n\ufb01nds some place in your music.\nJR: I think that this record more than\nthe other ones is kind of more openly emotional, you know? We let the\nharmony in the music go places that\nwe probably we would have avoided\npreviously. I think again that kind of\nrelates to the Lynch thing, because\n(Angelo) Badalamenti\u2019s music can be\nso emotional earnest at times. Which\nmakes it verge on the edge of being\ncheesy. That for me is kind of special,\nhow it remains sort of cheesy but sort\nof austere at the same time.\nRA: It does kind of have a cinematic\nnature to it. It sort of seems to build\ntowards a euphoric synth at the end.\nIs there a sort of progression in the\nalbum or is it like separate suites?\nJR: It was originally gonna be over 2\nhours long. So it was very much supposed to be one long piece that moved\nvery slowly, and at times was collage\nbased but other times very much on\none trajectory.\nJT: It was kind of like a \ufb01lm in that\nway. That we had to edit it down, and\n\ufb01nd out how we were going to end it\nand cut out all this stu\ufb00. It was always\na problem, like how does this all \ufb01t together and how does it kind of work.\nJR: I think at\nthe same time\nit was just\none big thing.\nJT: Yeah, we\ndidn\u2019t make\ns e p a r a t e\nsongs and\npiece them all\ntogether later.\nJR: It was really about de-constructing\none idea, into\nthe next idea.\nRA: I\u2019ve only\nin the past\nyear or two\nbeen aware\nof the amount of great artists from\nAustralia. Is the Australian scene\nlocalized to a few cities or is it wide-spread?\nJR: I think it\u2019s quite far reaching. People often say that Melbourne is sort of\nthe centre of that scene but I wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily say that\u2019s the case.\nJT: No, there are big scenes in Sydney\nand Brisbane as well, and of course\nother places.\nJR: Yeah, I mean there\u2019s all sorts of\nstrange noise bands that you hear out\nin the country towns and things like\nthat. I think it\u2019s a really exciting scene\nand it\u2019s also quite all-embracing in\nthe sense that there are people from\ndi\ufb00erent practices; people from an\nexperimental tradition, people from\nmore of an improvised tradition, people from a rock tradition, a lot of people are very supportive of each other.\nAMS album of the week\nBoards of Canada, the much re-spected, secretive and shadowy WARP\nsigned duo are back after a six year\nquiet period with a new album and\nan often different sound. Tomorrow\u2019s\nHarvest, billed as their most dystopian\nand gloom-ridden sounding project\nto date nevertheless has that irascible BoC sound \u2013 not IDM, certainly\nnowhere close to dub-step, but more\nlike a modern day, grittier Music for\nAirports. This album, with their characteristic layered soundscapes and offbeat synth stabs over slowly morphing beats is somehow sparser than their\nprevious offerings, as if everything has been put through an industrial filter.\nIt sounds like an urban sprawl on a particularly thoughtful day, one of the\nfew things the duo themselves have confirmed they were aiming for.\nIt almost goes without saying that the construction of the album is nigh-on flawless. Not a sample or sound has been wasted or used when not required and even though the early tracks individually remain quite static in\ntheir composition, the first half of the album retains a lot of energy and keeps\npulling you on. My first thoughts were of Aphex Twin\u2019s Selected Ambient\nWorks 85 \u2013 92, the album that arguably got me into this genre to begin with,\nbut far more melancholic. The few vaguely optimistic or upbeat tracks like\n\u2018Sundown\u2019 and \u2018Split Your Infinities/Collapse\u2019 keep the album from becoming too much of a dirge as we enter the second half but you still get the sense\nof a slight loss of direction. That said I can\u2019t listen to any single track and\nfind the cause although \u2018Uritual\u2019 is in my opinion the weakest track on the\nalbum, a drone piece which neither goes anywhere or is subtle enough to be\nof interest.\nThe stand out moment for me is \u2018Cold Earth,\u2019 a mix of the direction Tomorrow\u2019s Harvest has taken them in and some of their earlier work with a well\ncrafted drumline and a complexity and pace that makes you want to keep\ncoming back to it. The album as a whole is excellent, and has crucially beaten\nthe massive hype surrounding it. It\u2019s a great new direction for the duo to be\ntreading and they\u2019ve managed to find it whilst solidly remaining Boards of\nCanada. Get on it!\nBoards Of Canada \u2013 Tomorrow\u2019sHarvest\nEamonn Postlethwaite\n\n"

The Awards Committee\nchose the winners and Union Council\nunanimously upheld the decision.\nUnion Fellowship with Distinction was\nawarded to Nathaniel Bottrell, a longtime trustee, and Stephen Richardson,\nDeputy Rector of Imperial College London.\nThe winners of the Awards and Fellowship with Distinction were Nathaniel\nBottrell, a long-time trustee, and Professor Stephen Richardson, Deputy Rector\nof Imperial College London. There was\nalso Union Fellowship for Dr Lorraine\nCraig, Earth Science and Engineering\nAcademic Tutor. Many students were\nawarded Union Colours and Outstanding Service Award (see right). At the last\nUnion Council of the academic year\nall of the sabbatical o\ufb03cers, including\nTim Arbabzadah, Felix Editor, and Shiv\nVorha (ICSMSU President) were awarded Honorary Life Membership.\nThe President\u2019s Awards were also announced at the last Council of the year.\nThese are awarded by the Paul Beaumont, Union President, with no other\ncommittee being involved and are his\npersonal pick of those that have supported the Union in an outstanding way.\nClub, Society, or Project of the Year\nPresident\u2019s Award went to Caving Club\nfor discovery of the longest cave in Slovenia back at the beginning of the year.\nRhys Tyers Caving Club Chair said:\n\u201cConnecting our cave systems and\nthereby discovering the longest cave in\nSlovenia this summer was the crowning\nachievement of over a decade of work\nby the caving club. We think this project has taken over a hundred person-years of e\ufb00ort and it\u2019s really nice to see\nthis recognised by the union and RCC\nthrough these awards.\u201d\nThe Undergraduate Representation\nPresident\u2019s Award went to Biology Soc.\nAaron D\u2019souza Biology Departmental\nRepresentative said: \u201cI think that there\nhave been a lot of people this year who\nhave put a lot of work and e\ufb00ort and\ndedication into making this year so successful for the Biologists. In my case, I\nhave had a lot of support from the BioSoc, the Biology department, the Biochemistry dep rep and Doug (Hunt).\nWithout them, Biology wouldn\u2019t be\ngetting this award.\u201d Doug Hunt, Deputy\nPresident (Education), said that they\nhave \u201cincreased the number of their\nSta\ufb00-Student Committees for the next\nacademic year so more issues can be\nraised and dealt with more swiftly\u201d\n. He\nadded that they have been heavily encouraging their lecturers to use Panopto\n[lecture podcasting]\u201d\n.\nThe Postgraduate Representation\nPresident\u2019s Award went to the Business\nSchool. Simon Schillebeeckx Business\nSchool Departmental Representative\nAemun Reza News Editor\nsaid: \u201cUnfortunately I cannot be here\ntoday as I am giving a talk at the Goodenough College Conference in North\nLondon. I am very happy to receive this\nreward and that Paul and Doug decided\nto award it to the Business School for\nrepresentation. I have tried my very best\nto intermediate between the needs of\nthe students and the appropriate college channels. If I were successful in\nmy endeavours, I think this wouldn\u2019t\nhave been possible without the fantastic\ncooperation with Doug, Paul, Andrew\nGeorge, and Debra Humphries. Thanks\na lot\u201d\n. Hunt commented saying: \u201cThey\nhave convinced the College to increase\nthe PhD writing up period to 12 months\nas Imperial is behind our competitors in\nthis respect, they have also helped give\nthe rest of the College academics insight\ninto the Business School\u2019s workings and\nhave made the Graduate School write\nvarious drafts for College policy e.g. the\ndouble marking de\ufb01nition and group\nplagiarism rules.\u201d\nThe President\u2019s Personal Awards were\ngiven to three individuals. Professor\nStephen Richardson was again the recipient of an award. Richardson was a\nstudent at Imperial and completed his\nPhD in 1975. He later returned as a\nlecturer in 1978 and has been a permanent \ufb01xture of Imperial since 1987. He\nwas appointed Deputy Rector in 2009.\nBeaumont said: \u201cStephen has been a\nchampion for the student voice and student experience for the last twenty-\ufb01ve\nyears. Since his appointment as Deputy\nRector, he has been the go-to person\nin the College Management \u2013 always\nfrank, honest and willing to listen. \u201c He\nwent on to say: \u201cStephen has been a\ngreat help to the Union itself this year\ntoo; helping with our new Partnership\nAgreement, Code of Practice, Funding\nand Space agreements. He has always\nhad a good word to say on the Union\u2019s\nbehalf when it comes to campaigns like\n#AgainstActon, the College Management Board\u2019s response to student views\non the new halls, the Holland Club and\nLevel 0, and the Union\u2019s involvement in\nthat.\u201d Beaumont also commented on the\ngood feedback he gets from his lectures\nand his promotion of teaching when he\nwas Head of the Department of Chemical Engineering. He said: \u201cDespite being\none of the most powerful \ufb01gures in the\nCollege, Stephen has never forgotten his\nroots \u2013 nor probably his days as a student here.

    "content": "Welcome to Esther island!\nThisweek\u2019stourguideisSanchit Sharma.Feelfreetoaskhimanyquestions\near Esther. The\nmorning after\nI was washed\nashore, salt in\nmy ears, sand in\nmy mouth and\nthe waves always at my ankles, I felt\nas though everything had conspired to\nthis one last shipwreck. I remembered\nnothing but water, stones in my belly\nand my shoes threatening to drag me\nunderwater to where only the most\nlistless of creatures swim.\n\u201d\nIn Dear Esther, you control a disembodied camera and use it to explore\nan unnamed and uninhabited island\nin the Hebrides. A narrator reads\nout transcripts of letters to a woman\nnamed Esther, and sections of these\nmonologues are read out when the\ncamera reaches semi-random trigger\npoints.\nWhy do I call it a camera, and not\na character? I call it this because at\nno point does it interact with the en-vironment. It cannot jump, it cannot\nkick pieces of the scenery which seem\nto be movable, it cannot so much as\nopen a door. It is merely a way for the\nplayer to enter this world, as opposed\nto a way for the player to in\ufb02uence it.\nHowever some people argue that it\nis actually a character, and to be fair\ncertain points do make much more\nsense if the game is treated in this\nmanner.\nIt should be noted that there is no\nbutton to jump in game. This can be\nsomewhat annoying when it feels like\nthe ability to jump would give you\na little more freedom. If this could\nbe added in such a way to still not\nincrease the area to explore by too\nmuch, it would simultaneously be\nmore satisfying for the player and not\nmuch more work for the developer.\n\u201cAt night you can see the lights sometimes from a passing tanker or trawler.\nFromuponthecli\ufb00stheyaremundane,\nbut down here they fade into ambigu-ity. For instance, I cannot readily tell if\nthey belong above or below the waves.\nThe distinction now seems banal; why\nnot everything and all at once! There\u2019s\nnothing better to do here than indulge\nin contradictions, whilst waiting for\nthe fabric of life to unravel.\n\u201d\nVisually, the game is stunning. The\nisland is mapped out in great detail,\nbut due to the lack of mechanics or\ngeneral crazy things going on as with\nmost games, it will quite happily\nrun at 1080p on a graphics card that\nwouldn\u2019t normally be able to handle\nit. The range of environments and textures presented on such a small map\nputs some recently released major titles to shame.\nIn addition to this, the soundtrack\n\ufb01ts perfectly and complements both\nthe visuals and the monologues very\nwell. It is available to stream or buy\nfrom the o\ufb03cial website, which is a\nvery good idea on the part of the developers \u2013 the soundtrack would be\nworth the cost of a normal album.\nIn order to immerse yourself in the\ngame more, I\u2019d recommend playing it\nwith 3D vision not only on, but turned\nup at least halfway. It really accentuates the feelings created by the game\n(at least, up until the bridge of your\nnose starts hurting because nVidia\ndidn\u2019t think about people who wear\nglasses), although there are points\nwhere it is a good idea to turn it o\ufb00.\nThis is pretty much only if you go un-derwater, however, so it isn\u2019t a big deal\nand does little to damage the immer-sion.\n\u201cDonnelly\u2019s book had not been taken\nout from the library since 1974. I decided it would never be missed as I\nslipped it under my coat and avoided\nthe librarian\u2019s gaze on the way out. If\nthe subject matter is obscure, the writer\u2019s literary style is even more so, it is\nnot the text of a stable or trustworthy\nreporter. Perhaps it is \ufb01tting that my\nonly companion in these last days\nshould be a stolen book written by a\ndying man.\n\u201d\nThe story, of course, is the main\npart of Dear Esther. It is about an\nunnamed man talking to a woman\nnamed Esther, most likely his late\nwife. The letters and a few cutscenes\nheavily imply that Esther was killed\nin a car accident by a man mentioned\nlater on in the game, Paul. The narrator often also mentions a cartographer named Donnelly, who charted\nthe island in the past, originally coming to the island to \ufb01nd details of a\nhermit told to have lived here but\nbeing unsuccessful in his task and so\nmoving on to write about the island\ninstead.\nDue to the fact that on any given\nplaythrough many of the monologues\nwill not be encountered, the story\ngiven to the player is incomplete and\nforces them to draw their own con-clusions. There are many minor details that will give an insight into parts\nof the plot that are never mentioned,\nand it is down to the player to uncover the truth, though it is never con\ufb01rmed what exactly that is.\n\u201cDonnelly reported the legend of the\nhermit; a holy man who sought solitude in its most pure form. Allegedly,\nhe rowed here from the mainland in a\nboat without a bottom, so all the creatures of the sea could rise at night to\nconverse with him. How disappointed\nhe must have been with their chatter.\nPerhaps now, when all that haunts the\nocean is the rubbish dumped from the\ntankers, he\u2019d \ufb01nd more peace. They\nsay he threw his arms wide in a valley\n\u201c\nD\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 14 JUNE\n32\non the south side and the cli\ufb00 opened\nup to provide him shelter; they say he\ndied of fever one hundred and sixteen\nyears later. The shepherds left gifts for\nhim at the mouth of the cave, but Donnelly records that they never claimed\nto have seen him. I have visited the\ncave and I have left my gifts, but like\nthem, I appear to be an unworthy subject of his solitude.\n\u201d\nI would be less inclined to call this\na game and more inclined to call it a\nwork of interactive art. If this is the\nkind of thing that you enjoy, Dear\nEsther would certainly be worth your\nmoney.\nMy only complaint aside from the\njumping and water issues is that there\nis no log \u2013 being able to read or listen\nback over what you have previously\nheard would make the story far easier to get to grips with the \ufb01rst time\naround, and allow a player to understand and draw their own conclusions\nwith only one playthrough, as opposed to the two or three it took me.\nOther than that, this is a truly amazing piece. It is available on Steam for\n\u00a36.99\nOh God no! The UrbEx\nitch is back! Probably\nneed some tetanus\njabs after though....\nIt\u2019s like wearing the\nBoots of Blinding Speed\nWell, maybe we\u2019re not exactly in the middle of a war, but the Felix office does\nfeel like a war room. There\u2019s only one edition of Felix left this year, and we always need more cannon fodder conscripts writers, to let us make one last grand\nhurrah!\nIf there\u2019s something you\u2019ve been thinking about writing, in between bashing\nsome exams out, drop us a line, and we\u2019ll make next week the largest games section that has ever graced the face of Earth.\nAny questions, comments, war tactics or possible recruits, feel free to email\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 14 JUNE\n30\nThe Rock is a softie\nJohn Park Film Editor\nSnitch\nDirector: Ric Roman Waugh\nScreenwriters: Justin Haythe, Ric\nRoman Waugh\nStarring: Dwayne Johnson, Jon\nBernthal, Susan Sarandon\nJust because Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d\nJohnson is headlining a \ufb01lm that\ncontains the plot of drug-tra\ufb03cking, doesn\u2019t automatically turn this\ninto an action-packed ride. Which\nis a great surprise, since Johnson is\ntaken out of his usual comfort zone,\nand his role here actually requires\nhim to show a range of emotions to\nsell this story that is based on true\nevents. And it\u2019s certainly a change in\ngear that he handles extremely well,\nas with Snitch, Johnson shows that he\nhas more to o\ufb00er than his macho side\nthrowing punches.\nAs an owner of a construction\nbusiness, John (Johnson) is leading a\nquiet life and he wants to keep it this\nway. This is until his son Jason (Ra\ufb01\nGavron) makes the mistake of getting mixed up with the wrong crowd\nand ultimately, drug smuggling. After his arrest, the minimum-sentence\nlaw states that faces ten years in jail\n\u2013 seems harsh, but that\u2019s what the\nlocal US Attorney Joanne Keeghan\n(Susan Sarandon) and her tough an-ti-drug stance is insisting takes place,\nno exceptions allowed. The way to\nreduce sentencing is for Jason to assist in making signi\ufb01cant arrests of\nbig players in the drug scene. But he\nrefuses to be an informer \u2013 so his father volunteers his services. He will\ngo undercover, make some deals\nthat will hopefully end in arrests big\nenough for the US Attorney to be\nmore lenient.\nPerhaps The Rock could be seen as\na bit of a miscast here \u2013 anyone who\nmesses with The Rock\u2019s family in any\nstandard action vehicle would have\naround an hour or so before he comes\nviolently knocking. But here, John is\nan utterly ordinary businessman,\nwith very little skills required to lead\na one-man army. In fact we even see\nthe mighty Rock get beaten down by\na group of thugs as he unwisely tries\nto enter the drug world by himself,\nnot knowing what to say and who to\napproach.\nHelp is at hand however, as John\nreaches out to an ex-convict employee of his who has a history of drug\ndealing. Wanting to stay clean, start\nover, and avoid his third strike, Daniel (Jon Bernthal) reluctantly agrees,\nnot fully aware of John\u2019s true inten-tions. John will also receive tactical\nsupport from Agent Cooper (Barry\nPepper), and so the dangerous assignment begins.\nEssentially the message that is repeatedly used throughout is the fact\nthat fathers are willing to do anything for the bene\ufb01t of their fami-lies. And we see several examples of\nfathers doing whatever is necessary\n\u2013 the most obvious one here is John,\nDaniel also has a son and wife to\nsupport, the same goes for the drug\nkingpin they\u2019re trying to take down,\nJuan Carlos \u201cEl Topo\u201d Pintera (a very\nwell-cast Benjamin Bratt). Very little\ntime is spent on Pintera, the antago-nist, and it\u2019s all about the \u201cgood\u201d guys\nput in impossible situations, getting\nin way over their heads.\nThere are tonal inconsistencies\nlargely due to the \ufb01lm not quite being able to balance the thriller side\nto the more grounded drama aspect.\nIt\u2019s better in giving us the tense excitement even with a relatively tight\nbudget \u2013 the inevitable \ufb01nal highway\nchase involving a shootout is on a\nsmall scale, with very little gimmick\nand yet is able to deliver some quality\naction. The many stand-o\ufb00s between\nthe good guys and bad also have effective input in working towards a\nclimax, more so since we\u2019ve already\nseen just how vulnerable John is in\nthis unpredictable criminal world.\nLess well done is the \ufb01lm\u2019s focus on\nthe individual characters themselves.\nEven though the ensemble doesn\u2019t\nlook at all crowded, the \ufb01lm struggles\nto throw in a variety and the running\ntheme becomes very tiresome and re-petitive. Yes, yes, the fathers are doing this amazing thing, but what we\ndon\u2019t need is a constant reminder of\nthe struggling children who we start\nto feel less and less sorry for the more\nwe see them take up the screen time.\nMore frustrating is the under-use of the most talented member in\nthe cast, Sarandon. With a potentially juicy role as an ambitious, cutthroat political ladder climber who\nis initially solely invested in this for\nher gain, she barely features on the\nscreen. Granted, whenever she does\nturn up she has some ice-cold dialogue to spit out, but given the talent\nshe possesses, this is no doubt a role\nthat is far too simple and underdevel-oped, given how much time is given\nto other less important players.\nOverall it\u2019s a \ufb01lm full of pleasant\nsurprises. Most noticeable is Johnson\u2019s transformation and that he\ndoesn\u2019t look out of place in a role that\nshows a lot more weakness. This goes\nto show he\u2019s far from the action star\none-trick pony we all thought he was,\nand to witness that alone is worth the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s running time.\nThe Rock is ready for his close-up\nSay something about my beard...go on...I dare ya\nYou tried to domesticate...ME?!\n\n"

There are many things\nonly a few will notice but have huge\nimplications for the Union: I guess I\u2019m\npretty proud I registered the Union as\na charity with the Charity Commission to ensure we keep our charitable\nstatus in the future. Introducing two\nfree drinks at the Summer Ball is only\na partial implementation of my manifesto promise, but I was wrong to say\nit would be a\ufb00ordable to have an open\nbar: it is much more expensive to run\na ball at a venue that isn\u2019t normally a\nnightclub (ie on campus!).\nStefan Nubert, DPFS\nThere are a few things I\u2019m happy about\nachieving this year. The \ufb01rst one is the\nmajor restructuring of the commercial services at ICU. This may not be\ninstantly visible to students and it\u2019s\nactually still on going (should be \ufb01nished by mid-July). It was a manifesto\npoint for me and something I am passionate about improving. It\u2019s actually\nmade parts of this year very frustrating for me, waiting on processes to\ncomplete but now ICU\u2019s commercial\nservices are in a much stronger position for the future now the di\ufb03cult\nphases are over. Going forward the\nnew management (once fully in place)\nwill continue to improve things. It\nalso gave more life to the role of the\nDPFS, making it signi\ufb01cantly more\n\u201chands on\u201d than in previous years.\nAnother point is the re-introduction\nof drinks o\ufb00ers. I had to push hard\nfor these initially, but having built a\nstrong working relationship with the\ncommercial services manager we\u2019ve\nintroduced a good range of o\ufb00ers. A\nlist of a few other little things such as\ngiving a pay-rise to the senior student\nsta\ufb00, making We Are Metric nights\ncheaper for clubs, proposing future\n\ufb01nancial safeguards, upping slightly\nthe grant awarded to CSB along with\nan increase to the IC Trust funding for tours (jointly with Henry the\nDPCS) and introducing sorted recycling to our bars.\nA \ufb01nal almost trivial point, but important to me, was being approachable as a sabbatical and being as quick\nas I could to respond to and deal\nwith club queries. I feel I\u2019ve mostly\naccomplished this, but as ever with\nthe sheer volume of these, there will\nbe those who felt I wasn\u2019t e\ufb03cient\nor helpful enough dealing with their\nproblem and I can only apologise for\nthat. Overall I feel our sabbatical team\nhas accomplished a number of major\npoints this year and cooperated on a\ngreat number of projects.\nDoug Hunt, DPE\nI have built on the great work the\nprevious DPE\u2019s have done before me\n\u2013 improving the \u201cYou Said, We Did\u201d\ncampaign, running 2 Rep Weeks (with\ndoubling the number of tips sent to\nyour reps), NSS 2012 Response and\ngiving a more detailed breakdown of\nwhat takes place in all the Sta\ufb00-Student Committees across the College.\nThrough benchmarking and seeking\nstudent opinion on international opportunities the College is now o\ufb00ering\nfunded summer research placements\nat several other world class universi-ties, while I have also helped increase\nsurvey turnout in SOLE and the NSS.\nI also worked with the Departmental\nSocieties to increase the number of\nstudents taking part in the Mums &\nDads scheme, made sure every Dep\nSoc has a Fresher Facebook group\nto welcome \ufb01rst years, raised over\n\u00a3700 for them via Soc O\ufb00 events\nand already made sure the incoming\ncommittees are trained, so it can be\nimproved for next year. This year we\nalso launched the A-Z rep \ufb01nder online tool and the Student Academic\nChoice Awards, which allows students\nto reward some of the College\u2019s best\nacademics, support sta\ufb00 or Graduate\nTeaching Assistants. Lastly, the entire\nSabbatical team and I worked together\non a vast range of projects together to\ntry and improve the student experience at Imperial.\nBecky Lane, DPW\nIt\u2019s been much more hectic than I\ncould have ever imagined but all the\nmore enjoyable for it! This year I have\nwritten the \ufb01rst Student Experience\nSurvey response which will be used\nby College to improve and shape the\nstudent experience at Imperial. I have\nbegan work with ICT to try and solve\nthe age old personal tutor problem\n(something which I really hope remains a priority). Lots of exciting projects I hadn\u2019t even considered when I\nran for election have popped up, as I\nhurriedly write this I am in the process\nof writing a bid to the NUS/HEFCE\nto try and get the Union \u00a3240,000 of\nfunding to spend on green projects.\nDespite all of that, I\u2019m pretty sure I\nwill just be remembered as the girl\nwho got the petting zoo, bouncy castle\nand massages\u2026 which isn\u2019t the worst\nlegacy in my opinion.\nTim Arbabzadah, Felix Editor\nWell, I\u2019m not really sure exactly what\nto write here, despite it being my idea.\nSo here goes nothing. This will, in all\nlikelihood, be a mini manifesto re-David Goldsmith\nUnion President\nYasmin Edwards\nDPCS\nKieron Creagh\nDPFS\nNatalie Kempson\nDPE\nMarissa Lewis\nDPW\nJoe Letts\nFelix Editor\nAge: 20\nCourse: Medicine\nYear: 2\nWhy I ran: The position allows me\nto get fully stuck into the Union,\nenabling me to dedicate all my time\nand effort to it. This is what I have\nbeen craving all year.\nNext year I aim to ensure the people who volunteer their time to\nrun clubs & socs get all the support they need to do so, this is\nespecially important for chairs\nand treasurers. I plan to increase\nstudent involvement in clubs &\nsocs by running a re-freshers fair\nand encouraging more engaging\npromotion of clubs & socs events.\nI also aim to improve the training\ndepsocs receive to facilitate better and more varied department-wide events. And finally, I hope to\nbe a friendly face so people feel\nthey can come and discuss in person any problems they might face\nin running clubs & socs.\nAge: 21\nCourse: Biology\nYear: Final\nWhy I ran: I have had a great time\nbeing involved in clubs & societies\nand it has been a massive part of\nmy experience at Uni. I want to\nencourage more students to get\ninvolved in things other than their\nstudies so this great experience\ncan be shared, and hope by making the running of clubs & socs\neasier, more people will do so.\nNext year I will be working for you\nover in the Union offices. It will be\nmy job to listen to your comments\nand ideas and, along with my own\nexperience, improve everything\nI can. One of my main goals is to\nmake more students proud to be\npart of Imperial College Union.\nI hope to do this by giving everyone a better understanding of\nwhat we actually do and how\nmuch most students, one way or\nanother, actually use the services\non offer. I also have a lot of ideas\nwhen it comes to our bars, and\nnot just in South Ken, to ensure\nthey provide a relaxed, social and\nstudent focused atmosphere that,\nmost importantly, everyone wants\nto use. However the Union is not\njust the building or facilities it\nprovides, I plan to make sure it is\nas easy as possible to play sports,\njoin and run clubs and societies\nand organise events. Keep an eye\nout and throughout the year I\u2019ll\nmake sure you\u2019re updated on everything that\u2019s happening. And if\nyou have any ideas or just want to\nknow what I\u2019m doing and you see\nme about just let me know!\nAge: 21\nCourse: Biology\nYear: Final\nWhy I ran:The Union has been a\nbig part of my life, I want to make\nit even better and I\u2019m excited to\nspend another year here.\nme about just let me know!\nNext year I want to focus on the\ngood stuff rather than just the\nbad. This year the first Student\nAcademic Choice Awards were\nheld, and next year I want to\nmake these bigger and get more\nstudents nominating those members of staff who really make a\npositive impact on their time at\nImperial. Increasing awareness of\nUROP will hopefully increase the\nnumber of research opportunities for undergraduate students\ninterested in research, while increasing the number of places on\nBEST courses will benefit more\nbusiness-minded individuals. A\njob for all of us will be to ensure\nthat we are involved in every decision made about the development\nat Acton, so that future Imperial\nstudents have the best possible\nstudent experience.\nAge: 22\nCourse: Public Health (Masters)\nYear: One-year masters\nWhy I ran: I love education. I ran\nfor DPE in the hope that I can\nmake you all love it too.\ntudent experience.\nThe main aim for next year is to\nensure Imperial is an inclusive\nand positive experience for all\nof our students. The prospect of\nmany of Imperial\u2019s undergraduates living out in Acton has really\nhighlighted the need to tailor welfare for incoming students which\ndoesn\u2019t rely on proximity to South\nKensington; a goal which would\nno doubt benefit post-graduate\nstudents who can be similarly\nvulnerable, especially if moving\nto London for the first time. In a\nsimilar vein, I\u2019m keen to work with\nthe newly-elected welfare officers\nto ensure the needs of all students\nare represented and fought for.\nI\u2019m also really looking forward\nto continuing and expanding the\nStress Less scheme and STI clinics\nstarted by Becky, to ensure they\nare sustainable for many years to\ncome.\nAge: 22\nCourse:Medicine\nYear: 4\nWhy I ran: I decided running was\nmore constructive than complain-ing... and my housemates happen\nto be very persuasive.\nNext year\u2019s Felix will be bigger\nand better! We\u2019ll be producing\nmore news and featuring contributions from a larger range of\nstudents from all campuses and\nas well as introducing a \u201cWhat\u2019s\nOn\u201d section and a Careers section.\nWe\u2019ll also take a closer look at the\nUnion and bring you interesting\nfeatures and surveys.\nFor next year I plan to open Felix to the masses by providing an\neasy article submission system\nand providing explanations about\nhow we operate. I will start with\nthe aforementioned new sections\n(What\u2019s On, Careers) and exciting surveys. My focus for the next\nyear is to expand Felix with more\ncontent relevant to the average\nJoe Huxley on all campuses.\nAge: 22\nCourse: Civil Engineering\nYear: Final\nWhy I ran: For the chance to shape\nand produce news and entertainment for all Imperial students.\nview.\nFirstly, I redesigned the paper and\ndid a (pretty needed) deep clean of\nthe o\ufb03ce. The latter people didn\u2019t see\nunless involved in some way. Hopefully, the paper and o\ufb03ce look pretty.\nI think I kept up the fun tone, and\nhopefully made it enjoyable to read\n\u2013 including an added page of light\nrelief. I also tried to do some investigative news stories. The international\nstudent fees one and the (controver-sial, sorry) look at workloads spring\nto mind. I regret that I didn\u2019t get to\ndo more of these. I had plans that I\nstill think would be great; the weekly\npressures of getting the news and paper together meant that I just didn\u2019t\n\ufb01nd the time, and, for that, I am sorry.\nI tried to bring all of the news to you\nin an unbiased and informative way.\nI de\ufb01nitely do think that I held\nCollege and the Union to account, I\nthink. I don\u2019t think I ever didn\u2019t say\nwhat I thought on the matter. Loads\nof things spring to mind: Acton,\nTranslation Studies, Holland Club.\nI lowered Clubs and Socs adverts\nand was very accommodating in\nterms of prices (ask any of them!).\nWhere I failed: I didn\u2019t ever hold a\nproper o\ufb03ce party open to everyone.\nIt would have been awesome, but I\ntried a smaller version and realised\nit probably was a bad idea with the\ncomputers. I\u2019ll hold my hands up and\nsay my bad, but you can pop down to\nthe o\ufb03ce and say hi whenever you like\nand I\u2019ll always \ufb01nd time for you. I also\ndidn\u2019t hand out papers personally on\nFriday. Maybe I will one of the last\ntwo weeks. To be honest, you probably didn\u2019t want to see me at that tired\nstate.\nOverall, I tried to make the paper\nthe best it could be. I worked myself\nto near madness this year, and hopefully it paid o\ufb00 in some way!\nThis year\u2019s Sabbaticals. From left to right: Henry Whittaker (DPCS), Tim Arbabzadah (Felix Editor), Paul Beaumont (Union President), Becky Lane (DPW),\nStefan Nubert (DPFS), Doug Hunt (DPE)\nMy main focus for next year is the\nrelationship between the students\nand the College. Much greater notice must be taken of student preference before decisions, big and\nsmall, are made. This extends into\nall areas of the student experience\nand I am hinting here in particular\nto the building of halls in North\nActon. My aim is to vastly improve\nthe input students have on these\ndecisions. I will be working closely\nwith Nat (DPE) and the Pro Rector\n(Education) to ensure that the new\neducation strategy that is being implemented is tailored toward what\nstudents feel is currently lacking.\nWith regard to the Union, the em-phasisagainwillbeongettinggreat-er student input. This is particularly\nthe case with regard to the Union\nbar,MetricandtheSummerBall.\nA unique plan of mine for next\nyear will be to investigate the implementation of a free half-day each\nyear in which students in the lower\nyears at the University are able to\nengage together in charity fundraising or volunteering. This will likely\nbe a great challenge to achieve but\nitissomethingIwillbefightinghard\nfor.\ncome.\n\n"
