He was also projectionist and\nsubsequently chair of the Science\nFiction Society for a year and is currently Social Clubs Committee\nchair. This means he co-ordinates\nthe activities of all religious, political and miscellaneous societies in\nthe Union, which involves liaising\nwith both society chairs and the\ncurrent sabbaticals. He recently\nran a week-long set of events\naimed at raising awareness of ideological issues related to SCC soci-e ties, while he keeps up to date\nwith broader Union developments\nin his role at Council and Union\nFinance Committee meetings.\nTim St Clair, Proposer\nMy background shows that I will be\ncapable of ensuring non-preferential treatment and accessibility for\nall clubs and societies, for instance\nas regards room bookings. I want\nto encourage both inter-society collaboration in areas of possible\noverlap such as ArtSoc and\nDramSoc or past agreements\nbetween JapanSoc and SciFi, and\nhigher society profiles in the available media. This also applies to\nthe Constituent College Union societies if they wish.\nFurther, I would like to draw on\nexisting resources by informing\nsocieties about the Events &\nMarketing Manager and how he\ncan help publicise what they do.\nThis co-operation could lead to\nthemed society events similar to\nThird World First's Brazilian\nNight/Sol Beer promotion.\nRelated to this is better interaction between the broad sub-groups\nof societies (MSCs) whose chairs\ncould meet regularly to discuss\nmatters of mutual concern, for\ninstance more effective use and\nexpansion of facilities like the proposed sports hall extension. This\nwould allow the handling of soci-e ty specific problems, such as athletics training, by those closer to\nthem.\nFinally, I believe that my wide-ranging abilities make me a good\ncandidate for the'job.\nPro posed By: Karl Drag e Tim Townend is a good communicator with a friendly personality\nand is the ideal candidate. While at\nImperial College his energy and\nmotivation have helped him to\nbuild an extensive knowledge of\nthe workings of the Union clubs\nand societies. He is currently\nExploration Society Treasurer and\nRugby Club Captain where he contributes substantially to the social\nand practical sides of College. Due\nto his close ties with these and\nother clubs he is aware of the\ndemands that will be placed upon\nhim as D.P.( Clubs and Societies).\nAs Chairperson of the Athletic\nClubs Committee I have spent an\nextensive amount of time working\nTim, and can say he is capable of\ndoing an excellent job.\nKarl Drage, proposer.\nAs Deputy President I aim to\nresolve many of the difficulties that\nhave confronted me and other stu-dents. Many of these points are\nimportant to give you the opportunities and balanced education you\nrequire. My main objectives are\noutlined below:\n-Promote and encourage the\nArts societies: Providing a better\nbalance of opportunities between\nthe Cultural societies and the\nSports clubs.\n-Regain I.C.'s national sporting\nstatus: Following discussions with\nthe new Sports and Leisure\nof coaching in all college sports.\n-Ensure student recreational\nimprovements: Extend and unify\nrecreational resources with lower\npricing on existing facilities yet\nmaintaining the individuality of\neach CCU.\n-Extend club social links:\nAnnual RCC Clubman's/ ACC Sportsman's Dinners and interaction with St.Mary's. Improve student awareness:\nIntroduce a 'Soc. Contact' notice\nboard and a mid-year fair to promote clubs and societies.\n-Develop a 'SPORT FOR ALL'\npolicy: The creation of faculty\nsports leagues to raise money for\nRAG and promote social sport\nwith both this years Sabbaticals and Manager, I will obtain a high level throughout College.\nProposed By- Thurka Sh'a pal an Can you imagine how hard it is to\nwrite this type of material for the\nfirst time? Well, I guess I 'll just be\nhonest and tell you why I think I should do the job.\nConcerning the job and what it\nentails, I believe I have a good idea\nalready. I am currently the captain\nof college's Ladies Association\nFootball Club, running it single-handedly, having to deal with all its\nmatters from playing to treasury\n(nowadays), to fixtures and all other\narrangements. This has given me\nfirst hand experience of the dedication and organisation that goes into\nrunning a college club, which\nmeans I am quite appreciative of\nthe workload involved for this\nDeputy President.\nMy clubs' experience is not just in\nsports. I have sat on the OSC executive committee, which involved me\nwith several societies and their\nsmooth running. Also, I have been\nand am a member of various other\nclubs and societies (an executive on\nsome, an ordinary member on o th ers), as well as closely observing\nthe running of many others.\nSo, as far as my capability of handling the job goes, I think you will\nagree the job will be safe with me!\nThe above covers the job title, but\nobviously there is more to it than\nthat. As an executive involved in\nthe running of the Union I shall find\nout what you the student would like\nto happen, whether you are unhappy with College or you simply think\nthe bar extensions should be longer\nand more frequent, I will stand up\nfor you representing your requirements to those higher up.\nI will deal with students' problems\nwhen elected. I am going for this\npost, because I want to achieve\nsomething for us.\nf FELIX24 FEB95 "

    "content": "News\nElection\nUpdate\nBY ANDREW TSENG, NEWS EDITOR The 1995 sabbatical\nj election campaigns\n\u00a3 are underway. After\npapers came down last\nFriday, nine candidates\nare standing for the four\nsabbatical posts.\nThose confirmed as\nstanding are: (for President)\nMiles Ambler, Kevin Ward, Sarah White,( for Deputy\nPresident Finance & Services)\nMatthew Crompton, Annie Matthewman, (for Deputy\nPresident Clubs & Societies)\nLuke Gietzen, Tim Townend,\nMaryam Yahyavi and (for felix Editor and Print Unit Manager)\nRachel Walters. New Election is\nalso standing for all posts.\nFollowing papers coming\ndown last Friday, the election\ncampaigns have officially started.\nWhich, of course, has resulted in\nthe traditional explosion of\nelection publicity across college!\nSmoker\nBan By\nMedics\nBY ANDREW TSENG AND ANDREW SMITH Mary's students have banned\nsmoking in Gladys', the St\nMary's Hospital Medical School\nrestaurant, following a two day\nreferendum.\nThe referendum, held on\nWednesday and Thursday,\nfollowed a debate on Tuesday of\nthe motion, 'This house believes\nthat smoking should be banned\nin Gladys\". Proposing the\nmotion were, Paddy, Joffs as the\nGhost of Roy Castle, and Prash,\nwhile Rich Birom, Nick Own and\nCamilla Blake, spoke against it.\nIn a heated debate, chaired\nLittle Interest In Guilds\nBY ANDYS IN HA RAY There are still no candidates for\ntwo of the City and Guilds College Union posts, and the\nother positions have only one\ncandidate each. Sarah Thomas,\nthe current Guilds publicity\nofficer, is the only nominee for\nPresident. With hustings due to\nbe held today, the unusual lack of\ninterest in the elections has been\nsurprising.\nDuncan Tindall, Guildsheet\nEditor and Communications\nofficer, is standing for Vice President, and James Tuff, an\nAero 1st year, has put himself\nforward for the position of\nHonorary Secretary. The posts of\nHonorary Junior Treasurer, City\n& Guilds College Association\nRepresentative and Guildsheet\nEditor are also uncontested.\nAs felix went to press, noone is standing for the two\nremaining executive posts of\nPublicity Officer and Entertainments Officer. The posts of\nAcademic Affairs Officer and\nDepartmental Societies Officer\nwill be appointed by separate\ncommittees.\nIn an attempt to explain the\nworrying lack of interest, one\nsenior source in the C&GC U suggested that a relatively high\nproportion of students in Guilds\ndepartments are involved with\nother organisations, such as\nforeign students with their\noverseas societies. Other commentators have blamed the lack\nof interest in Guilds as the usual\n'Imperial apathy problem'. Last\nyear's voting turnout was around\n20%.\nHustings are due to take\nplace on Friday 24th February at\n1.00pm in the Imperial College\nUnion Ents Lounge.\nLord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare spoke candidly at an IC Conservative Society meeting to over 30 people\nAndrew Smith. Unfortunately he insisted that the publicly advertised meeting should be private and so the int\npoints that e made about the present prime minister, sexual scandals and his own salary cannot be reported\nby Devina Hanson, the risks of\nsmoking, highlighted by various\npainted sponges, were submitted\nas reasons for the ban. In\nretaliation, those opposed to the\nban advanced claimed that the\namount of smoke inhaled in Gladys' would not do any\nsignificant damage to non-smokers. This was emphasised by\nthe opposition table chain\nsmoking their way through the\nproceedings.\n113 votes were cast in favour\nof the motion, while 73 voted\nagainst and 49 voted for a compromise.\nIn other Mary's related news\nthe erection of the Basic Medical\nScience building came a step\ncloser this week. Virginia Bottomley, Secretary of State for\nHealth, announced that she is\nwilling 'in principle' to commit\nmoney to the construction. It is\nstill not clear, though, whether\nthe other main partner in this\nnew centre of excellence, the\nHigher Education Funding Council of England (HEFCE), is\nlikely to cough up in the near\nfuture.\nDr Rodney Eastwood,\nDeputy Managing Director who\nis coordinating Imperial\nCollege's application, admitted\nthat he was very pleased by the\nMinister's comments. Dr Eastwood warned that although\nthe signs are encouraging, he is\nnot 'counting his chickens'.\nA decision by HE FCE is\nnow expected before Easter with\napproximately half the money\nanticipated as coming from the\nfunding body. With a review by\nthe Treasury still continuing, all\ndecisions regarding the exact\namount of money each\norganisation will contribute have\nyet to be decided.\nDespite the remaining\nuncertainties all concerned are\nsaid to be encouraged, as Virginia\nBottomley is the second Cabinet\nMinister to have supported the\nproposal this month.\nIJTiM FELIX2 HF GB95 "

I am standing for ICU president because, my second ers and I believe, that, ICU could greatly\nbenefit from my talents. The basic\nfeeling of my policies, is the\nimproving of IC for the benefit of\nthe students. That means to help\ncollege maintain the academic\nstandards and provide good services through the union. I will make\nthe union much more accessible to\neveryone by advertising union\nevents and meetings much better\nthan at present. I will make every\nendeavour to help the CCUs to\nprovide a vibrant identity for their\nmembers, a vital part of IC life. I believe that strong CCUs makes a strong ICU which can then fight for\na better student life, in, and out, of\nthe classroom. I am for a referendum on the NUS. I am going to\npush for student representation on\nthe Management Planning Group\nCommittee, the only committee\nwithout student representation. I will reform ICU bars, and make\nthem fun. (I have been a successful\nrelief pub manager.) I aim to prevent the move of ICU from Beit\nQuad, and I have personally been\nactively involved in research. I will\nintroduce professional stewards for\nthe union with a few students for\nadmission purposes, to reduce the\ndanger to students and stewards. I also wish to make University of\nLondon libraries more accessible to\nImperial students, at present some\ncharge money for their use. I wish\nto review the cost of ICU life mem-ber ship, which seems high. The\nreformation of the Debating Society\nand Real Ale Society, amongst o th ers, must be a priority in time for\nnext year's fresher s' week. In short,\nthe image of ICU must improve via\nnot merely competitive excellence,\nbut also by cultural and social\nexperience.\nPresident: Sarah White Proposed ill! : \u2022' . '1\n\u2022\nEveryone knows that I'd be lying if I promised cheaper booze, bar\nextensions every night, dirt-cheap\nfood and accommodation for\neveryone. What I can quite happily\npromise you is enthusiasm, drive\nand determination to provide a more helpful and effective Union,\nthat acts as both the voice of students and the heart of I.C., trying to\nget what you want, whether it be\nrealistically priced halls, better facilities for your chosen activities or\nmore input into how the Union\nfunctions (to name but a few).\nAs President of the main voice of\nthe student body I know that my\nexperience as Geology Dep. Rep.\nand R. S.M.U. Welfare Officer shows\nI communicate effectively with both\nother students and College Staff in\norder to get what you want. Next\nyear, if College continue their\npresently unfeasible plans to move\nmany Union facilities into Sherfield\nto make way for a Conference\nCentre, we may be fighting to preserve what we already have.\nFor many students I.C.U. means\nmore as the heart of I.C., providing\nbacking, funding and facilities (that\nhopefully prevent us all from turning into a pack of lifeless zombies),\nfor a huge range of activities (none\nof which I shall name for fear of\noffending those I don't).I want these activities to grow\nstronger and to work together more\nat all levels, from the C.C. U.s to the\nsmallest clubs, in order to achieve\nmore with what we have, and to\npress for more recognition and\nfunding for all of them.\nFinally, it's very difficult to explain\njust why you should vote for me,\nbut I can only end by saying that I have the drive and determination\nto do this job, and I'd be dammed\ngood at it.

Whilst there\nhowever, they are hijacked by\nWade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry\n(John C. Re///y) who have robbed a cattle auction and are making a slow getaway down the river. They\nwant Gail, an ex-river guide, to\ntake them through 'the Gauntlet',\na deadly stretch of Whitewater.\nAs with the fire in 'Backdraft'\nhere the river is the major player\nwhich really raises the film above\nthe norm. Actually filmed on some\nof the most dangerous stretches of\nWhitewater in the world, the river\ntake on a character of its own,\nespecially if seen on a very large\nscreen. It is able to act as an\nadditional character and set the\ntone by being, for example, serene\nand calm or fast and fierce.\nKevin Bacon is quite sinister as\na 'different kind of nice guy', but it\nis Meryl Streep, in another\nexcellent performance, who\nmanages to create a new heroine\nfor the 90s. However director\nCurtis Hanson ('the hand that rocks\nthe cradle') is astute enough to\nrealise no amount of star power\ncan compete with the river. He\nuses long sweeping shots up the\nriver canyon which both show of\nthe beauty of the country and\nmakes the rapids look impressively\nlethal. This creates, especially for\nnon-rafters, a thrilling and\nexhilarating sensation which helps\nto draw the viewer in.\nentry and exit wounds\nnatural born killers\nNatural born killers is not a satire of violence in the media.\nRather, it is a lifesize model of such\nviolence. Thus, critics of the film\nmiss the point. Invariably they\nargue that the protagonists are\namoral and that the film lacks\ncharacters with any depth, not\nrealising that this is precisely the\nstance taken by the 'Real Life\nKillers' type programmes that clog\nthe American airwaves. They do not\ndeplore the violence (no worse then\nother ultra-violent films) but rather\nthey deplore being shown even a glimpse of the true blood behind\nthis week's 'Rapist in the Hood'.\nTheir argument is not with NBK but\nwith the trash culture which\nspawned it.\nNBK 'isn'ta film', I 've been\ntold because it lacks a strong moral\nresolution. Apart from this hilarious\nattempt to categorise films\naccording to some rigid predetermined concept, the concept itself is\nludicrous. So Stone can't make his\nFaustian pact of a movie without\nincluding a Forest Gump ending?\nGood grief! That is precisely the\npoint - NBK is a mega-fast pop\nmontage of celluloid thick screen-death. It is breathtaking, funky,\nfast, fluid (presumably if it was shot\non stodgy black and white video in\nthree takes in Poland it would have\nescaped censure) and absolutely\nnot about using defunct rules to try\nto tell people what to think.\nRather it is an attempt to make\nthe popular cinema goer think at\nall, using the medium in a new and\nambiguous way. And if attempting\nto educate the masses through the\nonly medium that they are\ninterested in is heresy, then may\nStone burn in piles of videos on the\nfront page of the Sun.\nFELIX2 TO9 S Noifyral born killers is the most\npowerful film I 've seen; well I 've\nnever felt like walking out of a cinema before.\nWhilst many films have gone\ndown the route of perverting\nfigures of authority -what film\nnowadays doesn't have crooked\npolicemen and prison wardens?-normally some semblance of\nbalance is kept thanks to the antihero construction. Not Stone.\nMickey and Mallory are amoral,\nunthinking figures. Even their\nvictims only figure as grovelling\nwretches, whimpering to be left\nalive. There are no humans in this\nfilm which is why it is so sickening.\nIt's not that the violence is\nespecially gory, there's no severed\nears or potential flamings, but all\nof it is brutal in a way that\nTarantino avoids.\nIt's a comparison that people\nmight be surprised about, but I 've\nalways felt that Tarantino is a moral writer. He's so steeped in\ncinematic tradition that he doesn't attempt to make 'realistic films'.\nHis films are clever because he\nplays on the syntax of cinema's stereotyped genres and makes us\nlaugh when his gangsters engage\nin deep semantic conversations or\nwhen their gun goes off by\nmistake. You might flinch at his\nviolence but it's never inhuman,\nit's just a moving picture on a silver screen.\nStone's films, fuelled by his\ndesire to 'make a statement', are\nattempts at reality (at least as he\nsees it). So when he attempts a satirical vision of media violence,\nhe doesn't just falls into the trap of\nbecoming what he seeks to mock,\nhe crashes into a full scale\nembrace.\n\n"

    "content": "Xtra Curricular SMteB.\nTalking About Problems\nKeys: Distress, Fears, Support\nTalking About Problems - Don Adlington,\nStudent Counsellor\nIn some\nrespects it\nseems a little odd that\nuniversity students should be\nthought to\nneed a range\nof support\nservices which are\nmore com-pre hen sive, better staffed and\nmore accessible than those available to their\npeer group outside. Virtually all universities\nhave an extensive medical service, staffed by\ndoctors and nurses who put a high value on\ntalking to their patients - hardly an image of\ngeneral practice recognisable to the consumers of National Health Service medicine\nin the country at large. Most universities have\nwell-staffed student service units where students can expect assistance and sometimes\nadvocacy in their dealings with bureaucracy.\nMost universities, including this one, have\nappointed counsellors whose brief, in essence,\nis an open-ended commitment to helping students with personal problems. Again the contrast with the world outside academia is very\ngreat.\nHow can we justify this allocation of\nscarce resources in favour of the most art icu late, intelligent, and able sector of the school-leaving population?\nAnother way of phrasing the question\nperhaps is this: what is so special about university students? There are two sorts of\nanswers, I believe. The most tendentious and\nvalue-laden one involves the economic argument that university entrants are themselves\nscarce resources and that as an advanced\ntechnology-based society we are fully justified, even obliged, to afford them extra support and protection. The other sort of answer,\nand the one I am most interested in, concerns\nthe peculiar nature of a student's occupation,\nthat is, sustained, systematic and high-level\nlearning, and the interaction between the\nlearning process and anxiety, distress and\nother emotional disturbances. I do not\nbelieve that on the whole the contingent life\nproblems that students have to cope with are\nsignificantly different from those of the rest\nof their age group - indeed it can reasonably\nbe supposed that they will not, on average, be\nas bad. To be sure there are some occupation-FELIX24 FEB95 al hazards associated with the intellectual\nhigh-flyer; for example academic excellence\nmay have been attained partly at the cost of\nthe neglect of other sorts of skills, particularly\nsocial skills, and it is true also that some\nkinds of stress, inseparable from university\nstudy, are not risks to which non-students are\nexposed.\nThe residual, but solid, justification for\nprofessional helping services in universities is\nthe degree to which the students' central\nactivity - study - is impaired by factors\nwhich would be far less disabling in terms of\nwork disruption for someone whose occupation was serving in a shop, digging holes in\nthe road or working behind a bank counter. A bereavement, a broken love relationship, or a parental divorce is equally traumatic for\neveryone, and the immediate emotional\nimpart is precisely the same. For the university student, however, and particularly perhaps for students at colleges like this, where\nthe work is cumulative and sequential, even a relatively short period of distress-related inefficiency can have a quite disproportionate\neffect.\nOther common, but less obvious, sources\nof distress and anxiety may also undermine\nthe capacity to study in a highly insidious\nway.\nFor example, the student who finds it\ndifficult to make friends, or who feels in\nother ways out of step with what is perceived\nas normal, may find some of the more\nmechanical tasks associated with work quite\neasy to cope with, but find it virtually impossible to sit and concentrate on work that\nrequires abstract thinking. \"I can't concentrate\", \"my mind wanders off on to other\nthings\", \"I spend hours just looking at my\nnotes, taking nothing in\" are very familiar\nphrases to those whose job it is to help stu-dents.\nThese sorts of problems can be infinitely\nvaried, but in practice there are some well-recognised patterns into which most people\nfit quite easily. Besides the sorts of problems\nalready mentioned - the fracture or threat to\nkey relationship, and the difficulties engendered by isolation and the fears associated\nwith it - 1 have in mind such problems as:\n\u2022 Anxieties about one's choice of course,\nand possibly about the next move in life, now\nthat all the more or less prescribed ones are at\nan end.\n\u2022 Coping with the competitiveness in academic work and learning to recognise the\nappropriateness of the level of degree one\nhopes to achieve.\n\u2022 Coping with the emotional demands of\nother students and friends and finding some\nsort of formula for dealing with the more negative aspects of human behaviour.\n\u2022 Mundane worries about money and\naccommodation, about the planning of one's time and the need to recognise that time and\nenergy are finite resources and that invidious\nchoices may have to be made.\nThere is no doubt that for all these sorts\nof difficulty, and many others, there is much\nto be said for talking to someone. People gen-e rally, but scientists and technologists in particular perhaps, tend to underestimate the\nsimple value of talking. Many of us, at times\nof difficulty, almost automatically turn in on\nourselves - partly out of pride (the powerful\nimpulse to keep up an appearance of competence), and partly out of the inappropriate\nrational argument that talking cannot change\nhard reality, cannot alter the substantive\nroots of our unhappiness, cannot alter 'the\nfacts'.\nTalking is important and effective in a number of ways. First, it enables people to\nexpress, and therefore to ventilate, their\n(often angry) feelings. Providing this is done\nin the right sort of setting, and with the right\nsort of response, it helps to liberate the energy required to tackle difficulties constructive-ly. Second, it is often by talking about things\nthat we are able to sort out one strand from\nanother and make some sort of coherent picture of the situation. Third, this more or less\nconscious sharing of feelings may well lead to\nnew ideas, new information, new initiatives\nfor tackling problems.\nThere are many people in College to\nwhom students can talk - their colleagues\nand friends of course, but also tutors, war-dens, doctors and student service staff. You\ncan also talk to me. I am not paid to do anything else, and my work is entirely confidential.

I'm Annie Matthewman,\nand I'm standing for Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services).\nWhy? Good question.\nIn the future I want to do a PhD\nin Virtual Reality, so no CV points\nthere.

From there, it's just a small step to the union's \u00a32m annual turnover! I 've been on the\nunion's council for two years, and\nthis year I'm on the executive as\nwell.

The present location in the\nBeit building gives the union a distinct identity. Extensive up-to-date\nfacilities within attractive surroundings provide the students with a social venue with tradition behind\nit, rather than a character less modernity which would be\ninevitable with a transfer to\nSherfield.

I believe that maintenance of\nthe traditions of all the CCUs is\nimportant. The balance of rivalry\nbetween constituent colleges with\nthe umbrella of ICU facilities opens\nthe door for an interesting social\nlife with something for everyone.\nThis can be maintained through\nproper funding of the CCUs, with\nenough supervision to ensure that\nwasted money is kept to a mini-mum.\nI know that I have the ability to\nsucceed as DP(F&S), and I hope you\nwill give me the opportunity to\nmake a worthwhile contribution to\nthe Union.\n2\n4\nPE B95 FELIX "

    "content": "Clued Up\nPOLITICAL SCIENCE\nReductionism employs a top-down\nmethod of analysis. It looks at a system from above and breaks it\ndown into well-defined parts. The\nprime ideology of Reductionism is\nthat a system is the sum of its\nparts. More importantly, the Effect\nof the system arises from well-defined parts. Or, and this is the\ncase that Reductionists look for, a well-defined part is the Cause of\nthe system's Effect. In a way, this\nsomewhat Newtonian view of\nsystems is understandable. Analysis\nseeks for the cause, the more\nsimple it is the better.\nAn example of Reductionism\nis biological determinism. This is\nthe Doctrine of DNA; the idea that\nwe are determined by our genes.\nThe Reductionist idea is to go for\nthe parts, the genes, notice that\nthey cause some effects on the\nwhole system, and label them the\npivotal engine for the whole\nsystem.\nThe Harvard geneticist\nLewontin argues against\nReductionism in his Biology as\nIdeology. His argument is based\nmainly on the fact that we do not\nknow; that sufficient evidence is\nnot around to say \"gene X determines characteristic Y\". His\nargument also relies on the fact\nthat proponents of Reductionismperhaps like all Science proponents\n- have an agenda. In the case of\nbiological determinism, or to be\nmore specific, in the case of the\nHuman Genome Project, there are\nbiotechnology companies to be\nfounded, profits to be earned,\npapers to author, reputations to be\nmade. Lewontin has pointed out\nthe close link that American\nacademic geneticists have with\ncommercial enterprise. The agenda\ncan become ever more frightening.\nAlastair Palmer, writing in the\ncurrent issue of The Spectator,\nargues against Hernstein and\nMurray's The Bell Curve, which\njustifies racism by biology.\nOf course, the complete\nopposite view to Reductionism is a holistic view of systems. That too\nseems disagreeable to me. There is\nare lig io spiritual aspect about the\nHolistic methodology that seems\nretrograde. The answer lies, as\nalways, in between. By refusing the\nabsolute, perhaps we are back at a definition of Science as organised,\nrational scepticism.\nSamin\nPoon\nWalking down Oxford Street. It's the Christmas rush, tourists\neverywhere, crowds of o vine shoppers all in a rush to go\nnowhere. The sun shines down\nfrom a clear blue weekend sky but\nit's cold enough to freeze the\nbollocks off a st. Bernard. There's only one way to go, so I walk with\nthe crowd, looking intently into\nevery shop window as I pass for\nthe gift to end all gifts. Suddenly,\nlike a hyperactive rattlesnake on\nspeed, or at least industrial\nstrength caffeine, the crowd stops.\nI walk into the woman in front, she\nlooks like an Olympic athlete - a Russian shot putter to he exact. She\nsmiles coyly, I try to pretend not to\nnotice while slowly edging away. I look past her to try to see what the\ncause of the hold up is; an accident\nwith lots of blood and gore\nperhaps? A punch up between\nirate shoppers? A rush to evade\nthe God Squad?\nNo. One small group bump\ninto another small group and\ndecide to have a chat in the middle\nof the pavement.

Do they know\nthat, while most shoppers don't mind queueing, we don't like\nhanging around just because\nthey've bumped into ThomasRichard-Harold from Chipping\nBloody Sodbury?\nWhat really worries me is the\nfrequency with which this happens\n- especially if you're in a hurry. For\ninstance, the Sherfield Walkway is\na perfect place for groups of three\nor more abreast to walk very, very\nslowly while chatting.

    "content": "Standby\nFrancis Dunnery\n\u00a9 throwing out the d ref fi\" Good evening ladies and\ngentlemen, my name's Franciscaffeine addict, sex addict and\nalcoholic.\" With those disarming\nwords, Francis Dunnery greets the\npacked crowd at his acoustic gig in\nCamden Lock's Dingwalls. \"Francis\nwho?\" you ask. Allow me to put you\nin the picture...\nOnce upon a time there was a Cumbrian band called It Bites. Many\nof you may be young enough to\nremember their one and only hit,\n'calling all the heroes' - a whimsical, fantastic al pop song that\nmade the top 10 back in August\n1986. In retrospect though, the\nrelease of that single was a mistake\nin that they were instantly perceived\nas just another pop band. Their first\nalbum, the big lad in the windmill,\nwas a patchwork quilt of heavy rock,\nprogressive rock, and pop, not\ndissimilar to Genesis before Phil\nCollins turned them into a limp,\nflaccid affair. By the time of their\nthird album, eat me in st. louis, It\nBites had evolved into a hard-hitting, progressive metal outfit. Just\nas it looked like they were about to\nbreak through (having just played\ntwo sold out shows at the then\nHammersmith Odeon) lead singer,\nsongwriter and guitarist supremo,\nFrancis Dunnery, quit. After two solo\nalbums, a stint as Robert Plant's lead guitarist and an alcohol\ncleaning-up exercise in between,\nhe's back to play his first gigs in this\ncountry for five years. Before the gig\nI chatted to the Plant-christened\n'Mad Frank' about his life at the\nmoment.\n\"It's nice. I guess the key to it\nall is that I stopped drinking. Two\nyears and eight months ago\nactually. I had to, because I almost\nkilled myself on several occasions ...\neventually it wears you down and\nyou end up on your knees. I have a disease, and I 've got to take care of\nit. 'We're born less than, so we act\nmore than' is kind of an alcoholic\ntrait, you always tend to think\nbigger than you are. You set\nyourself impossible tasks and when\nyou can't live up to them you get\nupset ... so we drink to numb those\nvery sensitive nerve ends out. But\nlife's good today. I have a good\nlaugh.\"\nAfter watching the gig, I think\nthat 'a good laugh' is the best way\nto describe Dunnery's on-stage\ndemean our. After the earlier\nopening line he tells us that \"there's something I 've always wanted to do\non stage\" and proceeds to make a cup of tea. In between songs, he\ncracks self-effacing jokes about his\nex-wife. \"She saw me drunk and\nthought, 'What an a*** hole'. She\nsaw me sober and said, 'What an\neven bigger a*** hole'.\" As for the\nmusic, let's just say that it was every\nbit as sublime and awe-inspiring as\nyou would expect from the frontman\nof a band who, to these ears, were\nthe best ever.\n'Homegrown' and 'american\nlife in the summertime' are both\nfrom last year's fearless album. They\ntake on a new dimension live, and\nstripped to their bare acoustic\nbones, they bleed with emotion.\n'Feel like kissing you again' is even\nmore pathos-soaked, as an ode to\nhis dead father who beat him when\nhe was younger. \"I couldn't feel\nanything because I was drunk, and\nit was only when I got sober that I sorted out how I really felt about\nhim, and wrote this song.\"\nBut it was 'underneath your\npillow' and the incandescent ly beautiful 'still too young to\nremember' that sent fr is sons of\nexcitement down the spine of each\nindividual in the room - two\nwonderful songs written by a late,\ngreat band. It says much that Virgin\nhave decided to release a 'Best of...'\ncollection five years after It Bites\nsplit up. And it says even more that\n'Mad Frank' has managed to come\nthrough alcoholism to emerge as a man wise beyond his years. I 'll leave\nyou with some words with which you\ncan chew the proverbial fat; \"You\nwanna make God laugh, then make\nsome plans. We sit there and try to\nplot our lives out ... 'I 'll do this, then\nI 'll do that.' It ain't like that. You\ncan't start plotting and trying to out-smart, out-think, out-do, outperform the whole world ... I don't say that this is the way it is - it's just\nthe way that I live my life. It's really\nnone of my business what the world\nthinks of me. It's my business what I think of the world.\" He pauses with\nan air of sudden revelation: \"When I was drinking the world was full of\na*** holes. Since I stopped drinking I can't find any a*** holes, and the\nworld hasn't changed has it?\"\nNo it hasn't, but maybe it\nshould... 0\no rotation\nsingles.\nthis is one of the better rap\nthe prodigy - poison\nsfu; Frisbee, anyone?\nnaked girl falling down the stairs\nfor real - you don't wanna miss\nout somehow mantra-liKe ana\ntransfixing ... peace... love ...\nsfu; Very listenable. easily joint\n^ walk tall\nOne of my earliest memories is that\nof my mother coming to kiss me\ngoodnight before she went out for\ndinner, musk i ly scented and elegant\nin an long A line skirt that just swept\nthe floor. Then I was in bed and half\nasleep, now I'm desperately hoping\nthat she still has the skirt...\nThe A line, having entered our\nwardrobes last year, still holds its\nown amidst the 50's revival, and\nelegance is still the key. However,\nwhile last year it meant Hollywood,\nthis year recall the girls from 'Alio\n'Alio whose clothes always clung\nand whose attitudes were nothing if\nnot wanton. Whether the faithful Aline or pencil thin, skirts should\nleave no one in any doubt of the\nshape of your hips, and tops should\nbe just short enough to display\nwaists clad in skinny, patent leather\nbelts. In an era that smacks of the\nfrump ish, ridiculously high heels and\nvamp ish hair are the key.\nIt is an oft quoted fact that it\ndoesn't matter so much what you\nwear as what you do with your shoes\nand hair. If not glossy and\ncontrolled, hair should look full\nbodied and slightly back-combed -an off perfect finish along the lines\nof 'I 've just had a good roll in the\nhay'. This, apparently, has an\nundeniably sexy effect.\nObviously, with the onset of the\nVamp, girlish plaits are a little pass e, along with just about anything else a student can afford. So it's off to Vidal\nSassoon to offer oneself up as a sacrifice to the developing artistry of\nthe student hairdresser. Just\nremember that it's free, so there's no money back if you decide you\ndon't like sky-blue highlights. 0\nFELIX24 F GB95 "

    "content": "Incoming\nAcademic Despair and a Conservative Backlash\nAffairs\nDear Felix,\nHaving previously been both an\nAcademic and Departmental\nRepresentative for the Department\nof Computing, I was interested to\nread the piece \"Half-Hearted Day\"\n(FELIX 1020) about the most recent\nAcademic Affairs half day.\nTo anyone who has never been\ninvolved in academic affairs it must\nhave been strange to read that\nsubjects such as the price of bread\nand fire-alarms were discussion\ntopics, perhaps assuming that it\nwas just a case of bad journalism.\nUnfortunately this has not been the\ncase as for as long as I can\nremember, the discussions have\nrarely been based around the\nimportant issues concerning the\nacademic affairs of college.\nThe 'network' of Academic\nRepresentatives and Officers is\nsupposedly there so that all\nstudents may voice their opinions\nat all levels, be it a simple\ncomplaint about a lecturer or a more wide-spread problem. The\nAcademic Affairs half day is an\nopportunity for all involved to meet\nwith their counterparts to discuss\ndepartmental and college-wide\nproblems and then to put them to\nthe panel of college staff.\nRecently we have seen the\nintroduction of a Student\nRepresentative Council to make it\neasier for students to air and\nresolve non-academic issues, but\nI'm sceptical that this will ever\nhave the required effect. The fact is\nthat the Academic Reps, one or\ntwo from every course and year,\nare a much broader representation\nof students than those on the\ncouncil.\nPerhaps the channels of\ncommunication between the\nstudents, staff and the Union\nshould be more clearly defined, so\nthat the Academic Affairs 'network'\ncan be used for its original\npurpose.\nHelen Randall\nDoC III\nMore politics\nDear Felix,\nI feel that I must comment on\nyour somewhat biased writings\nconcerning LabSoc and ConSoc.\nLet me firstly make it quite clear\nthat the two societies both try to\nwork together to make Imperial\nCollege a place where some\npolitical debate actually takes\nplace, unlike at present where the\npopulace of the college seems to\nbe overcome by apathy. The\ncomments on last weeks letters\npage only show how incapable of\nlistening some people can be.\nThere is harmony between the two\nsocieties, the only \"gape\" between\nus is created in the page editor. If\nhad read Ian Bayley's letter\nproperly, he would not have\nwritten such ludicrous comments.\nConcerning the \"News in Brief\"\narticle, we did not \"Snub yet\nanother prominent Tory M.P.\" as\nyou intone. The word snub implies\nthat we consciously arranged not\nto hold a meeting for Mrs Gorman\nfor the sole purpose of\ninconveniencing her. I would have\nexpected more that News of the\nWorld style reporting from Felix. In\nactuality a large portion of the\nblame for this incident lies with the\nI.C. union office for failing to pass\non the message from Mrs\nGorman's private office which\nconfirmed the meeting. We\nnaturally assumed that Mrs\nGorman could not attend the\nmeeting as no reply was received.\nIn addition, the statement\nconcerning Mrs Gorman's taxi fare\nis misleading. It was in fact already\nagreed that were she to visit, we\nwould pay this - it was not\nintended to punish in for \"Sheer\nIneptitude\" as you put it. I assume\nthat David Hunt was the other Tory\nthat we snubbed. This is clearly not\nthe case. It is interesting that some\n2 0 0 people turned up to hear Tony\nBenn speak, it shows that some\nare never willing to listen to\nanyone s point of view except for\ntheir own - otherwise why is it that\nthe ConSoc meetings are not this\n(Sub)Edited this week by Paul Dias\nwell attended? The answer is clear\n- because many people do not\nwant to listen to views that are not\ntheir own - this is a fact of life and\nit is not fair to lay the blame at\nConSocs or LabSocs door. We\naccept that we have unpopular\nviews in the context of college,\nhowever we have persevered to try\nand bring some of the real world\nof politics into the college and to\ntry and help people to be more\naware of what goes on in the\nworld around them. It is just a shame that people cannot be\nbothered or do not want to hear\nthese people speak. If people turn\nup they can ask whichever\nquestions they wish - the more\ncontroversial, the better in some\nrespects. I am personally\ndetermined to do something\npositive for this college.\nIn conclusion I don't think that it\nis really fair to give us as lagging every time a slight problem arises.\nIt would be much more helpful if\nyou were more constructive in your\napproach and made people aware\nthat those who are after all elected\nto govern this country are\nrepresented here almost every\nweek, purely so that students can\nair their grievances and ask\nquestions.\nRichard M.

    "content": "Feature\nL ast night I seemed to die. Lying in\nthe gloom of night, I watched as\nimages drifted from my sleep bound\neyes and left me alone. Sinking into\nthe dream world I felt infinite space\nfold around me, cool and filled with peace. Gazing\ninto this atmosphere I seemed to be entirely apart\nfrom anything. Where was I? Just as I voiced that\nquestion, a shambling figure appeared at the blue\nhorizon.\nWith his trademark tuxedo and his\nscruffy, collapsing coiffure I recognised my\nguide; for it was none other than Yves Kleinartiste, creator and voyager extra ordinaire. When alive, Klein had proclaimed himself the\n'Master of the Void', and at once I realised\nthat this shimmering emptiness around us\nwas his empire, his domain. Greeting me, he\nsaid, \"We are cast outside the phenomenology\nof time!\". He recounted to me tales of the\nevents that brought him to his rule.\n\"Avec le vi de, les\nplein sp ou voir s\" Albert Camus\nKlein became an artist in the truest,\nmost pure sense of someone who does not\ncreate art, but lives as a work of art himself.\nOriginally trained in Judo, he made his first\ndecisive step on this path when, whilst lying\non a beach near Nice, he took possession of\nthe sky. Concentrating on its limitless blue, he\nturned it over and signed the back. From that\nday forth his true aim as an artist was to take\npossession of space, what he termed the Void.\nLeading me forth, he explained; \"I am the\npainter of space. I am not an abstract painter\nbut, on the contrary, a figurative and realist\npainter\". We arrived at his first great\npaintings, the monochromes. Huge canvasses\nimpregnated solely with his own special\ncolour, International Klein Blue. It was as a printer that he had discovered the profound\neffect of ultramarine blue. He patented his\nown pigment and became its master, for blue\nwas the perfect representation of the Void.\nLooking at these paintings the colour seemed\nto shimmer and extend beyond them, glowing\nwith an intangible intensity that one can not\nbelieve. I could see that the Void is not empty,\nbut rather is fulfil ed, replete with the power\nhe trapped within this colour.\nKlein led me further, past his attempts\nto represent the space that he wanted to\noccupy. He left a gallery empty once, simply\nwith the walls painted white. Entering it\nthrough blue curtains, he explained that the\nroom contained \"the sensibility of\nimmaterial is ed blue\". On again, and a shadowy figure appeared. This clumsy man\nexplained that he was an art dealer, that he\nwished to buy some space for himself. I watched this incongruous pair as Klein sold\nAD him a certificate in exchange\nfor a palm ful of gold bars. The\ndealer burned the certificate,\nwhilst the artist splendidly\nthrew half the gold into the\nRiver Styx. Yes, Klein even\nsold the Void, such was his\ndesire for possession.\nMy tuxedo'd guide again ^\ntook me on. We passed his\ncountless other experiments.\nHis attempts to create art with\na flame thrower, burning\nimages into boards. His playful red and gold paintings,\nwhich fail to generate the\nresonant power of his original\ncolour. Entering a small,\nprivate chamber we witnessed\nas an orchestra played but a single note. Meanwhile\nbeautiful, naked models\ndraped their bodies over\nsheets, leaving blue patterns\nfrom paint smeared across\ntheir skin. These were his\nan thro po me tries. Strange,\nenigmatic paintings made by\nthe pressure of the models\nthemselves, reminiscent of the\nTurin Shroud, Hiroshima and\nmuch besides. He offered an\nexplanation; \"The essential\nmass is the trunk and the * at.\nthighs. It is there that we find '/m: the real universe\". I stared at\nthe paintings awhile. In true life, as opposed\nto reproductions, they have an eerie\nsensibility to them. The images are literally\nlife sized, and so echo the creation that forced\nthem into existence.\nDrifting, I began to understand the\nnature of Klein's obsession. The Void has an\nirrepressible power. It is like death; but at\nonce alive, cool and meditative. It is not the\nstark nothingness of black, but overpowers all.\nWhat intrigued me was why his chosen\ncolour, blue, seemed to portray this concept so\nfully. I turned to ask but as I looked he\nclambered onto a wall and leapt away. Soaring\ninto space, he vanished into the empty world\nthat he had finally conquered. Left without a guide, this nothing surrounded me.\nf FELIX24 FEB0 S feature\nE AM OF BY MARCUS ALEXANDER\n\"In the pandemonium of image, I present\nyou with the universal blue, Blue an open\ndoor to soul. An infinite possibility,\nBecoming tangible.\"\nT he blue ness closed in. The\ndarkness of death, full infinity.\nI panicked. Is this it? The end?\nI groped for an answer to my\nquestions. \" Why blue?\" I shouted. Eventually answers\ncame drifting through space, words and\nvoices. Blue movies, blues music, blue jeans,\nblue blood; but these are not the answer.\nPicasso entered a blue period, his images\nposed in haunting attitudes of despair and\ngloom. Again blue means death. Then other\nartists began to speak, and at once people\narrived. Derek Jarman, the film maker, took\nme through his garden at the boundaries of\nthe nuclear Dungeness. Whilst dying of Aids\nhe made his film 'Blue', a paean to the colour\nand its infinitude. Through his disease, for\nwhich he was taking thirty pills a day, he too\ncould see the Void. As we looked at the\nshingle flowerbeds, he stated that \"blue\nwalks into the labyrinth\". Blinded by his\nillness, he wrote the chapter 'Blue' of his\nbook 'Chroma' in the darkness of a hospital\nbed.\nA strange flower\npoked through the\npebbles; it was a Bavarian gentian. This\nwas a gift from D.H. Lawrence, who wrote a poem about sinking\ninto death. The gentian was its colour, a blue\nso deep it emanated darkness. It seemed that\nthis colour is resplendent in the peace of\ndying. The razor blade voice of Trent Reznor\nof Nine Inch Nails echoed my sentiments\nover the airwaves.\n\"Let me guide\nmyself with the\nblue, forked torch\nof this flower down\nthe darker and\ndarker stairs, where\nblue is darkened on\nblue ness...\" D.H. Lawrence\nLeaving the artists behind I drifted up\nthrough history and science, each attempting\ntheir own answer. I saw shiploads of the\noriginal blue arrive at an ancient port, the\nblue which inspired Klein. It was\nUltramarine, this name meaning 'beyond the\nsea'. Pigments were rare and expensive in\nthose days, but this was one of the most\ncostly of all. Beyond the ocean the stones of\nlapis lazuli were mined. Ground to a powder\nand mixed with oils they made a paint more\nblue than any other.\nI met a mystic on the path, and he told\nme that blue is the shade of Binah. Intrigued,\nI listened as he explained that Binah is one of\nthe ten 'sep i roth', emanations of deity. They\nconstruct the Tree of Life, a complete\nrepresentation of the universe. The blue sea\nof Binah, or understanding, incredibly again\nrepresents the void! It is the third sep hira, in\nwhich the space of the universe becomes\nfulfil ed in creation (it can be thought of as\nthe addition of the third dimension, but\nmuch more besides).\nPassing into modernity I saw\nneuroscientists dissecting the eye to help me\nwith my exploration of blue. They showed\nme a graph; its lines showing the response of\nthe three cells that detect colour in the\nretina, the red, green and blue cones. The\nblue response lies out on its own, not\noverlapping significantly as do red and green.\nIf one wants to stimulate the red or green\ncells to their maximum, the other will also be\nexcited and the colour impure. Blue cones\nhowever can give a maximal stimulation\nalone. As the scientist talked on, I asked\nmyself, \"Is this the answer? Is this why blue\nis so great, so powerful, why it embodies the\nemptiness of death, of the void?\". Can it be\nthat simple? Can science ever hope to answer\nmy questions?\nI felt something drift across my face\nand awoke with a start. Lying on a beach\nnear Nice, I watched as one thousand and\none blue balloons float past, beneath the clear\nsky. In reverse, across that expanse of space, I clearly saw a signature, and my dream\nflooded back. I knew at this point that my\nintuition was right, that science alone could\nnever offer an explanation.\nYves Klein can be seen at the Hayward\nGallery. Check Eight Day Guidefor details.

Well papers come\ndown today so it must be the\nend of the phoney war and the\nstart of something else I guess.\nAll manifestoes have to be\ncomplete too. Owain earnestly informs me he needs 50\nwords 'from the proposer'. At\n11 O 'clock I sit down to start\nbuilding a myth for the\nvoters. I do 52 words. It's a bit\njumpy in the way it introduces\nthe fearful editor but it should\ndo.\nOwain doesn't arrive in until\n1.30. By that time Joe is back and\ndoing some posters but all I can get\nout of him is a gru ft yawn when asking\nwhat he's doing. Ah the nature of secrecy.\nOwain takes me over to Computing and\nwe go through the manifesto. It's pretty\npunchy but a new 'Jon Jordan' bit is thought\nup, even if little of it comes from me. At 2.30 I have to leave to fall asleep in a lecture.\nWe're back in the FELIX office at 5pm. A lot of can didi at es have turned up to get their\npublicity, which is released today. Kamran,\nLucy, Joe and Owain are all there; mighty in\nearly en thus i a is m. Lucy's posters are out first\nand are an absolute eyesore. She compounds\nthis by high lig h ing her name on them with a felt pen. With 500 posters and eight 'lucy s' per\nposter that's a lot of pointless work.\nThe poster teams rush around various\nbuildings, blue-tack asunder. The Union building is closest and it gets an unfair\npasting. Then us Owainites head out to the\nwalkway and the JCR. The latter, Owain's spiritual birthplace, is singled out for special\ntreatment. Our campaign manger, Paul, drives\nus on with his perfectionism. Twice I 've seen\nhim remove posters and raise them by two\ninches. What does his bedroom look like? In\nDay4,28:2:92 This doesn't really count as an election\nday as I'm only in college for a couple of\nhours. Owain tells me that his posters have\nbeen defaced in the JCR with the addition of\nwhiskers - he's proud of the fact but old fears\nare returning about whether he choose the\nright photos', too eff emin ant?I suppose it\ncould be his whole face which is the problem,\nI don't ask. I don't want to get in that deep.\nDay7,29:2:94 Owain is again sure that he has lost. He\nwants to run away to sea. I try to encourage\nhim. The moustaches in the J CR are still\nannoying him greatly. He moves crabbily\nround the office, mutters, throws features\naway amd moans again.\nIt's a day of radios and pressing the\nairwaves so we go down to ICRadio to be\ngrilled by the great irish bloodhound, Declan.\nBy the time we get there the studio is\nresplendent with burning deputy presidents\nand their promises. Joe looks worried, as is oft\nhis want these days. Owain immediately goes\nto the toilet. They finally both go into the\nstudio as the now slightly smouldering DP candidates come out. I head back to FELIX to hear the interviews. Everyone's crowded\naround the radio and it's a hostile audience\nr young Bennallack. There's general\nlaughter when he confuses 'of ff set' and\nweb offset' printing but he does OK. Joe's up next and between them it's hard to tell. Anyway how many\npeople are listening?\nDay12,8:3:95 Today is hustings day,\nsomething I only remember\n10 minutes prior to the event.\nAs FELIX editor is on first,\nI'm on first, first. Bravely\ntalking to the mic, I produce\ntwenty seconds of uncertain\nflannel. Owain's better for the\nnext minute but ends slightly\nhe sistan t ly. We then go out and\nOwain, in his usual par noid style,\nasks me how he was. My uncommitted\n' OK' produces a reply of 'You're a great\nright hand man'. We go into Da Vinci's to\nwta cha soundless Joe on STOIC.\nBy the time I return it's president al questions. The stereotypes are clear: Paul\nThomas, the insider has been to all the UGMs,\nLucy, concerned do good er, has done three\nUG Ms whilst Kamran, waster/outsider has\nbeen to none and he's proud of it.\nI try to reject it but Kamran plays his\nanti-president al game very well. Who wants a desk pre s let the Union sort itself out, let's have a president who goes out and meets\npeople. Paul is ignored, Lucy becomes\nsomething of a joke (was that skirt a mistake?)\nand all the questions revolve around Kam. He\nanswers as few as possible and always says\n\"Cheers\", in a 'vote for me, I'll buy you a drink' sort of way. Finally all the boring PGs\nstop asking questions about PG groups and it\nbreaks up.

It's a machine designed solely\nfor the purpose of producing individuals who will lead\ntheir fields, creating seemingly\nsingle-minded automata with no\ncontact with the 'normal' life\noutside their own small sphere.\nA column in a recent FELIX( 'Cat & Mouse', 1019), expressed\njust these opinions. Kaizen, the\nauthor, pointed a finger at that\nmost feared ogre of Imperialthe dreaded 'IC apathy'. I too\nbelieved in this condition about a year ago, but now believe this is\nnot necessarily the case...\nCommonly a sense of dedication and single-mindedness\nleads to the perpetrator being\nlabelled as 'sad' and 'socially\ninadequate'. Why should this be?\nIn most other fields, ambition\nand skill are judged as assets, and\nsingle-mindedness a treasured\ncommodity. Yet in the sciences,\nthis is not so. Why?\nOne possible reason is the\nmedia, and the influence of\npublic opinion. Films such as\n'The Googy Professor' and the\nvarious 'Frankensteins' have\nreinforced a stereotypical view of\nindividuals from ivory towers\n(usually with speech impediments and short-sightedness)\nwho don't understand the\nconsequences of their actions.\nThis opinion isn't that new,\neither. In the '30s, the Spanish\nphilosopher, Ortega y Gasset,\nwrote, \"the decrease in scientific\nvocations noted in recent years ... is\nan anxious symptom for anyone who\nhas a clear idea of what civilisation\nis, an idea generally lacking to the\ntypical 'scientist'.\"\nWhat is it that makes\nscientists so different from\n'cultured' people? Take students\nfrom the Royal College of Music.\nTheir lives dedicated to music,\nthey are, by default, cultured.\nWe dedicate our lives to the\nsciences. Therefore, we are not\ncultured? Surely there is a blinked anomaly here\nsomewhere? You could say that\nthe principle of 'culture' is based\nupon a pro-humanitarian-biased\nsociety. Either you get it, or you\ndon't. principle of 'apathy' is applied by\nthose that become terribly self-conscious, and don't want to\nbecome compartment ali sed. Imagine what went through\nFreshers' minds this year, on\npicking up their first issue of\nFELIX. There, complete with\ntrain-spotter pictures, was a guide\nto the different types of people\nseen at IC. I can't remember the\ndetails, but I'm sure it included\nthe terms 's pod', 'hack', and\nHow can we, as scientists, become\ncultured? IC has both the Haldane\nlibrary, and the humanities courses, to\nhelp produce 'balanced' individuals.\nBut, I ask, what is the point?\nHow can we, as scientists,\nbecome cultured? As you are no\ndoubt aware, IC has both the\nHaldane library and the\nhumanities courses to help\nproduce 'balanced' individuals.\nBut, I ask, what is the point? If\nsomebody wants to expand their\nown horizons, then fair enough,\nthe scheme is excellent. But why\ntry and force culture down those\nwho don't particularly want it? I am not alone in this opinion.\nThe Nobel laureate, Sir Peter\nMedawar, wrote \"...mercifully, the\nwhole hideous scheme of piping on\ncultural lectures for scientists came to\nnothing in any university I have ever\nbeen associated with, thus sparing\nsome well-meaning mediocrity the\nembarrassment of watching the bored\nwrithing s of students of Chem Eng\nmorally coerced into attending\nlectures on the English novel or on\nthe origins of the Romantic\nmovement in Germany.\"\nHe then goes on to point\nout \"...that students of humane\nletters are not in the least likely to\nbenefit from attendance at lectures on\n[science]. The trouble is that young\nstudents of Eng. Lit. simply don't want to know much of what the\naverage science lecturer would be\nable to impart to him.\" Why, should humanities be justified as\n'culture', but science not?\nWe all know it's very easy\nto stereotype.

What else would\na self-conscious individual think,\nbut' I do NOT want to be seen as\none of these stereotypes?'\nI edit Broadsheet and care\nabout what I do, hence earning\nme the title 'hack', a term I deeply despise. Similarly\nhundreds of people run and\nparticipate in the largest selection\nof clubs and societies of any\ncollege in the country. I can\nname several people, for example,\nwho would rather remove their\ninternal organs than be denied\nOpSoc. Is this 'apathy'?\nAs far as I can see, those\nthat wield the term 'apathy' as a weapon are seared of the stigma\ninvolved with admitting you\nhave other interests. I feel that\n'apathy' is more a self-descriptive\nterm of the user, wielded as a complaint about their lack of\ntrust in IC's 'unique' atmosphere.\nTrue, we do not have culture\ndirectly to hand, in the shape of\nhumanities students, but we can\nbring it in ourselves; and do,\nsuccessfully. For those of you\nthat don't believe me, then why\nnot try getting off your arse and\nfinding people who share your\ninterests - there are a hell of a lot\nof us! Culture will only come to\nthose that seek it. If you don't want it, then fair enough - just\ndon't complain about a lack of\naction in others !\nThis is my personal\nopinion.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College Nol022 24FEB95 Powermacs PilferedfromHuxley\nBY ANDREW SMITH An estimated \u00a330,000 of\ncomputer equipment was\ndamaged or stolen from the\nfourth floor of the Department of\nComputing in the early hours of\nSaturday morning. Further\ndamage was prevented when a postgraduate student heard the\nintruders, saving some of the\ndepartment's multi million pounds equipment from being\ntargeted.\nThe authorities have acted\nwith considerable speed. On Wednesday evening Camberly\npolice arrested two suspected\nintruders. They were said to be in\npossession of three serial coded\nSun workstations.\nTwo people were seen\nwandering round the department\nduring the previous afternoon\nasking about Powermacs, five of\nwhich were later stolen, but they\nwere not reported to Security.\nBoth King's College and\nUniversity College London are\nknown to have had Powermacs\nstolen in separate, but possibly\nrelated, incidents in the last two\nweeks.\nUnlike other departments in\ncollege, the Department of\nComputing keeps records of the\nserial numbers of all machines,\nwhich has enabled certain\nmachines to be recovered. They\nare now considering tighter\nsecurity measures after the cable\nand lug system proved\ninadequate. Measures suggested\ninclude attaching alarms to\ncomputers, or installing stronger\nrestraining systems. A different\ntype of computer, which was held\nby a sturdier security lock, was\nabandoned after the intruders\nfailed to detach it from its bolts.\nFELIX has been assured by\nDr Sloman, Assistant Director of\nComputers and Communication,\nthat no confidential information\nwas held on the hard drives of\nthe stolen equipment. All files are\nheld in the department's central\ncomputing service which were\nbacked up the previous night, so\nonly one day's work should have\nbeen lost.\nDr Sloman said that\nattempts to retrieve the lost files\nwere proving to be very time\nconsuming, but that all would be\nrecovered eventually. The effects\nof the theft on students should be\nminimal. Some of the stolen\nequipment has already been\nreplaced, and the rest is expected\nin the near future. One benefit:\nfirst year computing students\nhave had coursework deadlines\npostponed!\nIn a further incident in the\nHuxley Building Imperial\nCollege Security scored a success\nwith the apprehension of a dangerous intruder. After being\nspotted attempting to break into\na tea-room the trespasser was\nchallenged and attempted to\nescape.\nWith the College's mobile\nresponse unit promptly attending\nthe scene they were able to arrest\nthe intruder, who was in possession of a screwdriver and a long-bladed knife. Supervisor\nDockman made the arrest of the\nmale suspect who alleges that\nsomeone let him into the\nbuilding using their swipe card.\nThis incident, together with\nthe allegation that the computer\nthieves had explained their\nsuspicious activity by saying that\nthey were looking for toilets, has\nraised concerns that both\nstudents and staff are not being\nvigilant enough. Mr Terry Briley,\nDeputy Head of Security,\nrepeated the advice to all college\nusers to check the identity of any\nsuspicious persons, especially\nwhen allowing them access to\nlocked buildings.\n'Welcome to Imperial College Airport', writes Ivan Chan.

The senior three-men's crew went off\nahead and finished ahead, quite an achievement considering the open crews behind\nthem. The Imperial domination of Novice\nraces continued with the novice four a close\nthird, despite it being their first row in a cox ed four.

The women's first\neight won their section by an emphatic\nminute and a half, destroying all opposition.\nThe second eight finished third in their divi-sion, overcoming problems getting through\nsome lesser crews.\nYfogya 8og Introduction to Yoga Society\nKeys: Health, Enthusiasm, Zest\nYoga is an ancient health-art developed and\nperfected over the centuries by wise men of\nIndia. It is not a religion or a magic or mysticism, but the practice of Yoga can improve\nyour health and your appearance. For thousands of years it has been used to preserve\nzest and enthusiasm of youth into middle age,\nto promote clear-thinking,and to encourage\nresilience in old age.\nNot only does the regular practice of\nyoga make you look and feel younger and\nhealthier, but, through gentle exercise and\nnon-strenuous postures, it assists all your\nmuscles and organs to work at their full\npotential. Yoga has the ability to refresh and\nrelax you, soothe your nerves, calm your\nmind, and give inner serenity and strength.\nThe Yoga session lasts for one and a half\nhours, in which many stretching and balancing poses are performed. During these, the\nmain focus is the breathing and it is clearly\nunderstood that during these exercises one\nshould not force or strain in any way. At the\nend of the lesson, there is a period of deep\nrelaxation, in which it is possible to 'let go' as\nmany muscles and thoughts as possible. This\nis a very rewarding process as it is rare that\none truly reaches a state of true relaxation\nwithout first being shown how.\nOur classes are given by an experienced\ninstructor who is accredited by the British\nWheel of Yoga. Yoga is a non competitive\ndiscipline that can be enjoyed by all ages, students and staff alike, and beginners are\nalways welcome. Please come along and try a class for yourself; we meet on a Tuesday\nlunch time at 12:15 in southside gym.(\u00a33\nmembership, \u00a31.50 per class)\n<ih|D \u00a90\u00a9\nHong Kong Exhibition\nKeys: Economical, Political\nIf you came into college last week you probably noticed all the red and blue posters along\nthe walkway and the Chinese Society's exhibition held last week on level 2 in the\nSherfield Building. Our exhibition and semi-nar, called 'The Next Lap', looked at how\nBritain faces the problem of handing over\nHong Kong to China. The future economical\nand political development of Hong Kong were also the top issues of this exhibition.\nMany people saw our exhibition and\nmore than fifty attended the seminar. As a society, we hope that you enjoyed yourselves\nand that you learned something about Hong\nKong. May I end this report with a thank you\nto everyone who helped us with the event\nand all those who came to the exhibition and\nseminar.\nMan3.0(3 Forthcoming Attractions\nKeys: Junior, Lion, Nightmare\nThis week's line-up at Filmsoc has a lighthearted theme. The Nightmare Before\nChristmas starts us off at 8pm on Sunday,\nwith Tim Burton's humourous yet twisted\nperspective on an invasion of Christmas by\nthe inhabitants of Halloween Town. If this\nsounds a little depressing don't let it put you\noff, all we provide an opportunity to feel really happy on Wednesday at 8pm. Disney continue to amaze by producing\nsuch loveable films so frequently, but once\nagain they have created a classic, The Lion\nKing. Besides all the obvious fun and games,\nJames Earl Jones adds to the film with his\nbooming and powerful voice being used perfectly to portray Simba's father.\nAnother man with an awful lot of power\nis Arnie, who stars in Junior on Thursday at\n8pm. It was believed that he could only act in\none genre but he disproved that in Twins\nand, with the help of Danny DeVito, he re-strings his comedic bow. Emma Thompson\nalso shows up with another of her darling little performances.\nIf you are interested in helping us out\nwith the films and getting in for free, e mail\nfilms oc@ ic.ac.uk. You can also check out the\nlatest line up on our web page,\n'http://www.su.ic.ac.uk/Ents/cinema/'.\na os g Bladerunner - Directors Cut\nKeys: Cyberpunk, Human, Rain\nYet another perennial favourite (assuming\nyou all turned up last Tuesday). Set in a not\ntoo distant future - cyberpunk ish in its bleakness and continual rain - the film questions\nwhat it is to be human and who has the right\nto decide. Even if you have seen it already -this is one of those films that a big screen definitely improves. See you there!\nThe film is on Tuesday 28th February at\n7pm in the Union Concert Hall. Entrance is\n\u00a31.50 for members or \u00a32.00 for non-members.\nMembership for the year is \u00a33 with the first\nfilm free, and also gives you use of our library\nof 3000 books/videos/graphic novels.

Perhaps it's best seen in an\neu logical light - after all you only get crowded when you're expiring, both\nin an artistic and literal sense. Indeed the case in favour of Willem de\nKooning, for many the current title-holder, is undermined by the fact that\naged 90, he is suffering from senile dementia. Not that I'm suggesting\nthat de Kooning isn't 'living' in the full sense of the word, it just seems\nsurprising that in his present state he's still making paintings which are\nseen as being consistent with his 'non-demented' work.\nIronically however, this consistency is something that de Kooning has\ntried to develop throughout his career. As one of the key members of the\nso-called Abstract Expressionist movement, he was continually trying to\nfind a new non-rational creativity. His canvases are splattered with thick\nscabs of paint which he manipulated with palette and hands. To be\nhonest you wouldn't be surprised to find out they had been done by a group of particularly enthusiastic six year olds, but that was the point.\nDe Kooning's early work is the most accessible. In the first room, the\nfigures captured have, at least, a certain brute humanism that belies the\ncubist ic kaleidoscope he applied to their limbs. By the late 1940's though,\nde Kooning was already making his way towards new horizons. As his\n'abstract urban landscape' series controversially showed, the synergy of\nstyle when applied to the human figure resulted in a beast of gigantic\nproportions. Woman I(19502) forces the mannish form into the\nbackground, leaving it dependence on the concrete reality around. It's a very powerful painting, although one you can't help hating.\nBy the late 50s, de Kooning had started to paint his characteristic\nland and seascapes and make money. As you pass the years, the enigma\nof trying to work out the meaning of titles like Spike's Folly II fades as you\ndrifts in and out of rooms which are increasingly filled with 'untitled'\nworks. For all the calmness that these rooms inspire you get the\nimpression that the change of focus from human to natural forms\nweakened de Kooning's power immensely. By the end both he and his\nworks are washed out and lifeless. 0\nspike's folly II [1960]\nfame for half a nation\nBelgium - a land famous for its\nsprouts, its chocolate, a silly-moustache d fictional detective and,\nmost of all for its lack of fame. Until\nnow that is because, you see, five\nguys named dEUS have arrived.\nThe LA2 is fuller than I have\never seen it before; a motley\ncollection of hacks, indie kids and\nrockers vying for attention and a view. They clap politely for support\nband, Reef, and then wait with\npalpable antic ip ation. Why? Quite\nsimply, because these Belgians\ndon't sound like anyone else on this\nearth.\nTake 'suds and soda', 'via', and\n'hotel lounge' - three singles that\ntry to define an indefinable band,\nthe three songs that move everyone\nfrom awed stillness to awed frenzy\nand back again. The first steps\nnimbly from violin intro to noise fest\nto an the mic chorus. The second\ntakes a cunningly melodic verse and\ninserts a cunningly in harmonious chorus to illustrate its lyric of \"I skipped the part about love\"\n('borrowed' from REM's 'low'), while\nthe third is an anti-ballad of the first\norder. (Any song where people can\nget their lighters out, wave them in\nthe air, and yet seem like they are\ndoing the oddly appropriate thing\nhas got to be worth its weight in\ngemstones.) All are played precisely\nbut with the feeling that they\ndeserve, and more importantly,\nconjuring up the feelings that they\ndeserve too. And as if to prove that\nthere are no boundaries where this\nband are concerned they play a \"punk rock song\" in the encore - its\ntongue-in-cheek delivery belying its\nserious nuances.\nListen to the album, buy the Tshirt and see the band that take the\n'twerp' out of Antwerp...\nThanks to their new album,\nsmart, sleeper seem to have been\nin every music press journal around.\nWhich is strange since each mag\nseems content saying how mediocre\nthe album actually is.\nThe songs don't show anything\nnew in terms of style. It's genuine\nmiddle-of-the-road guitar based\nindie. Some of them are quiet with\na loud bit in the middle whilst some\nare all loud and distorted guitar. A lot of the tracks sound sound quite\nsimilar; in particular the first two,\n'in between er' and 'swallow'. I didn't even notice that the song had\nchanged until I looked at the track\nnumber playing. This is definitely\nnot a good sign because it shows\nthat Sleeper are immediately\nstruggling for ideas. Mind you, it's not all bad - 'in between er' is\nactually quite good and perhaps\nshows promise.\nA lot of hype has surrounded\n'delicious' which has those now\ninfamous lyrics, \"...we should both\ngo to bed 'til we make each other\nsore...\" Let me say one thing about\nthis song - it's probably the best on\nthe album! So if you bought the\nsingle then you'll know about the\nquality of the rest of the songs. If\nyou didn't then it might be worth\njust getting the single and perhaps\nleaving the album alone. I do hope\nthat we see more of Sleeper,\nthough, because Louise Wener is a bit of a babe. (6)\nSome might suggest that\nbrands of vacuum cleaners aren't the thing to name bands after. Well,\nHoover isn't terribly inspiring I grant\nyou but in the land where every-thing's bigger and better (that's notably not 'over here') growls a domestic sucker called velo deluxe. And after some dusty\ndealings, the debut album from the\nband of the same name has finally\nbeen released in Britain.\nIn the wider scheme of things\nsuper elastic is right on the button of\nclassic american guitar noise.\nDeluxe head man, John Sfrohm\n(once of Blakes Babies) has had\ntime to mature and get scratched up\nin equal measure and it shows.\n'Dirtass' concludes the opening\nquartet of straight fuzz bombs as it\ngrowls into action; \"I feel sick and I feel dirty, might be dead before I'm thirty\". Not a particularly novel\nsentiment granted, but it captures\nthe feelings involved as well as\nanything. The following track,\n'alibi', lays bare the opposite\nyearning; \"caught in a lie, when life\nbecomes a lifestyle you're my alibi\".\nWhilst other tracks show similar\nstylistic variations; a slower R'n' B inspiration for 'desiree' and\ncountry-rock for 'angels', all are\nfirmly subservient to the overall and\nunderlying theme.\nEnough groups have tried to\ncarve albums out in the indie-rock\nplains that it's become embarrassing on occasions but\n'super elastic' is marked as genuine\nstock.

    "content": "News and Editorial Beit Brawl Arrest\nBY ANDREW SMITH A student from Hammersmith\nCollege was arrested last Friday\nnight after attempting to gain\nentry to Imperial College Union\n(ICU). Union stewards recognised a group of three students\nwho were thought to have been\ninvolved in an attack at the end\nof last term.\nDuring the incident on\nNovember 25th, actual bodily\nharm was inflicted on a female\nsteward, while a number of other\nUnion employees had to be\ntreated in hospital. No arrests\nwere made at the time. But, last\nFriday, PC Clive Coleman\narrested the student concerned\nand took him to Belgravia Police\nStation for questioning.\nThe male youth alleged to\nhave been involved in the violent\nassault has not yet been charged,\nand was given police bail to\nappear gain on the 10 March. PC Coleman has yet to indicate\nwhether the case will proceed. He\nhas said that he will decide\nwhether to drop charges, caution\nor charge the man after\nconsulting the original\ndocuments, and by making\nfurther enquiries.\nThe arrest was made possible\nafter a steward who was involved\nin the fracas last term recognised\nthe alleged assailant at the\nentrance to ICU. Another\nsteward ran from the Union building to policemen who were\npatrolling a function taking place\nin the Royal Albert Hall.\nPC Coleman, who was\ninvolved in the aftermath of the\noriginal incident, was one of\nthose working, and together with\na number of other officers, they\nmade their way to the Union.\nThe three suspects were delayed\nat Beit Arch by stewards until\nthe police arrived.\nThe student, who was later\narrested, had the offence put to\nhim while standing in Beit Arch,\nbut he denied having been\ninvolved in the crimes.\nNews In Brief\nBY ANDREW SMITH AND JOHN SINNER\nUL U Election Farce\nWith the University of London\nUnion supposedly representing\nover 70,000 of the capitals\nstudents the union elections next\nTuesday appear to be somewhat\nfarcical.\nOnly one of the seven\npositions is being contested, that\nof Vice President (Finance &\nSocieties). Ian Parish, one of\nICU's Deputy Presidents, is one\nof Tara Jefferson's seven\nsecond ers for this post. The other\ncandidate for the contested job is\nCaroline Bright of the School of\nSlavonic and East European\nStudies.\nNo one from Imperial is\nstanding. The only other IC involvement is the seconding by\nLucy Chothia, ICU President, of\nKate Goldfarb and by Sarah\nWaiman, Chair of IC Jewish\nSociety, of Mark Krushner. The\ndecision on whether to elect the\ncandidates who have declared, or\nto re-open nominations will be\ntaken at aUL U General Union\nCouncil on 28 February.\nIllegal Parking to Stop\nImperial College is having\nparking barriers installed in Watt's Way, next to the\nSouthside Halls. Their purpose is\nto prevent the general public\nfrom parking illegally in spaces\nreserved for Imperial College\nstaff and students.\nThe barriers will be operated\nby encoded magnetic cards. In an\ninterview with FELIX, Mrs Straw, Imperial College Facilities\nManager made an assurance that\nthere would be no restrictions on\ncurrent use. The option of the\npublic paying to get access to the\nWatt's Way parking is also ruled\nout.\nWork has already begun and\nwill be finished by the middle of\nMarch.\nLord Archer\nOh dear. Starting to feel rather\nsorry for the Conservative\nSociety, I had hoped that this\nweek we could redress the issue\nwith a prominent Jeffrey Archer\nstory. Unfortunately, as reported\nin the news pages, Lord Archer\ndenied Consoc this glowing\nopportunity. Is it any wonder that\npoliticians have so little respect in\nthe public eye? It seems strange\nthat a private meeting was\npublically advertised for at least a week beforehand. I'm sure that\nLord Archer would argue that,\nrather than reflect poorly on\nhimself, his decision shows the\nlack of respect that he has for the\nmedia. Afraid that one small\ncomment could be blown up out\nof all proportion, the politician is\nforced to speak in verbose liquid y prose that has been through ten\nsub-edt or s. But regardless of\nwhose fault it was, he's saying\nthat when a politician speaks\nfrankly, the world cannot know.\nAnd that might explain a lot.\nElections\nYou'd never guess from the walls\nof the Union building that it was\nelection time now, would you?\nWell, at least you can keep away\nthe last few weeks of winter with\na cheap clean fuel.

At the last\nmeeting of Union Council we were\nappointed campaign managers for\nNew Election.

You are no more likely to\nsee him if he is elected (How many\nof the other candidates will dare\nmake that claim?)\nSo, why vote new election?\nNew Election is standing for all\nposts. If he gets elected there will\nautomatically be a second election\nfor that post, held during the summer term. This will enable you to\ntake your pick from a new crop of\ncandidates, the theory being that\nthey will be better than the last lot.\nTherefore, if you feel that the candidates standing for any post are\nnot up to the job, VOTE NEW ELECTION.\nOf course, there is a disadvantage; if New Election does win we\nhave to go through all of this\nagain. So please, for all our sake s, think before voting.\nOK! That's enough of the bor-ing, positive side of the campaign.\nWhat you really want to hear from\nus is what we think of the can di dates.
