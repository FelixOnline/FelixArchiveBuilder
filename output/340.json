    "content": "Page 2 FELIX October 2nd,1973 LETTERS\nGOODBYE FROM LINM\nDear All,\nI would just like to thank everyone who contributed to my Leaving/Wedding present last ses-sion. At the Union Council Dinner and Dance I was presented with a cheque and an inscribed\npewter tankard. No better present could have been\ngiven me than a tankard, as it really symbolises\nImperial College Union, doesn't it? However, it\nwill be well used, I can promise!\nI'd like to wish the Union every success for the\nfuture, I'm sure that under the guidance of Norm,\nPaul and Dave things will look up again!\nGoodbye.\nLinda Sommer (better known as Linda Creagh,\nUnion Clerk)\n\"Hillend\",\nPortbury,\nBRISTOL, BS209T W. Purple Patch\nWeil, here we are again\nat the start of yet another\nacademic year. For some\nof you this is the beginning of a new phase as\neither an undergraduate\nor as a postgraduate. For most of you it is merely\nthe beginning of another\ny jar in your University\ncareer. I would like to\ntake this opportunity of\nwelcoming each and every\none of you into the Union for the coming year, and\nhope that we get on well\ntogether.\nI \"raw*- \u2022-*w fsm* xt m^m For me, this year is a completely new experience\nin that 1 am in the HOT seat both for and with the\nUnion. I have never been\nin a situation like this\nbei'ore, and so all the help\nor ideas which you can\ngive will be most appreciated. One thing which should\nbe made clear at i the beginning of this year, is that\nthe Union meetings should\ntake the form of a Forum in which anyone can\nspeak. What makes these\nmeetings so boring is\nWhen the same people\nspeak on every motion,\nand thus one satisfactory\nconclusion ito the boredom problem is to speak\nwhen you have something\nto say. It doesn't take\nmuch to stand up and say\nwhat you think. If you\nhonestly don% have the\nnerve to Stand up then\nplease come ito the Union office before the meeting\nand put forward your\nviews to one of us in here\nand we will try to put forward your point of view.\nThe first tasks which\nWill beset the Union this\nyear are the election of\ncertain union officers. We\nalso have to elect a group\nof people ito represent the\nUnion at the November\nN.U.S. conference. Al though these elections may\nseem boring, it is essential that we have a representative vote at the meeting so that those persons\nelected really do represent\nyou.\nThe larger issues which\nwe will face this year are\nagain those of the Accommodation crisis and also\nthe Grants situation. All freshmen should have-* received in their mail from\nthe college a sheet outlining the grants situation as\nit stands alt present. During the Union meetings\nthis term we will be discussing our position in the\nfight for better grants for\nall, with special reference\nto area action at the end\nof October, and the correct forms of action for the\nrest of the year.\nThe problem of accommodation is a very complex one in the area\naround College, and poses\ngigantic financial problems for both the Union and also the College. More about this problem will be\nseen in future editions of\nFELIX, as we get more\ninformation on the pro b lem. By the way, if anyone either knows of some-one, or is in possession of\nabout \u00a32 million wh'i oh is\nnot being used for any-thing, then please see me\nas soon as possible as this\nis the sum required to\nbuild the new hall of residence on top of the sports\ncentre ! ! ! ! ! !\nHave a good year, and\nplease feel free at all times\nto come into the Union office for a talk about any\nproblems which you have\n\u2014either your own, or the\nUnion's. Looking forward to\nseeing you, that's me be-low!\nNorm.\nImperial College Publications All ICU publications are under the aegis and\nsanction of the Publications Board. They fall\nobjectively into two categories: regular and\nirregular.\nFelix and the RCS Broadsheet appear weekly\nand fortnightly respectively. The former needs no\nfurther mention as you're reading it now. The\nRCS Broadsheet is produced in the R CSU office\n(opposite the Southside refectory entrance) and\ncosts a penny. It has been the subject of many\nthreatened libel suits but through a liberal dosage\nof Tartan to the suitors remains as yet un litigated. This year it is in the hands of editor Digby L. James. It is rumoured that another edition of\nPentsheet, the infamous cornucopia of naughty\nbits that appeared last term, will not be attempted\nthis year as the entire stock was stolen before it\ncould be sold last time.\nThe irregular publications are Guildsheet\n(once/twice a term) and Minesletter (defunct).\nThe former is filled with ribald stories, articles and\npoems and occasional political comment (see the\nMoscow Trials issue) as well of course as flowing tributes lauding the successes of Guilds\nsports teams. Only those geriatric few doing research or deferred honours can remember the last\nappearance of Minesletter but rumour has it that\nit was even more blue in content and politics than\nGuildsheet.\nThere is one other student publication at IC :\nCEFE. Produced weekly by Socsoc it contains\npolitical commentary and analysis from the various\ngroups that attend Socsoc meetings. Last term\nit sprang to fame when it published the name of\nthe third minister involved in the Lambton/\nJellicoe affair when everyone tried to disown it,\nfearing a libel suit. However nothing happened\nand since the Young Liberals published a similar\nexpose and didn't get sued it seems that nothing\nwill. .\nOther publications that find their way into 10\nare \"Sennet\" the University of London Union\nnewspaper which appears fortnightly, and\n\"Magnus\" the NUS glossy which will actually pay\nyou for articles.\nNot to be forgotten are the University of London Bulletin published primarily for staff, and our\nown IC News which appears weekly and is difficult\nto read owing to its texture of intricately folded\nsheet metal. However both of these will keep you\nup to date with what's going on in the lofty circles\nof the non-student University areas.\nProduced once a year (at present), and in the;\ndistant past the only publication at IC, is the\nPhoenix. Primarily a literary magazine it prints\nstories, poems, drawings, photographs and commentary and welcomes any contributions from all\nstudents. Last year's Phoenix was somewhat delayed in going to press but should be out in th\u00a3\nbeginning of this term.\nSo then, with all that to occupy your sleepless\nnights as well as the occasional flurry of bump rt sheets, you will soon discover that not being able\nto read and write is no excuse for doing science!\nHON. SEC'S BIT\nWelcome to Imperial College. I would like\nto spend time explaining all the virtues and\nthe ins and outs of various aspects of college\nlife but there are numerous other publications\nin which this is adequately done and there is\nenough business in this column this week\nwithout this extra burden.\nBOMBS\nI would like to give a timely warning.\nAlready during the vacation, the college has\nbeen the victim of a bomb hoax. The next\none, however, may not be a hoax. All students\nare asked to keep a look-out for any suspicious parcels, boxes, bags, etc. If you have\nany doubts as to its contents then don't touch.\nWarn the people in the immediate area and\ncontact College Security/Fire Officer on internal 2741. Do not under any circumstances\ntamper with the parcel yourself.\nMake sure that you are acquainted with the\ncollege alarm systems. They are here for your\nbenefit. Please take notice of them.\nLEGAL AID\nThe Union has telephone access to a qualified solicitor. If you have any legal problems,\ne.g. accommodation, drugs, motor accidents,\netc., contact me in the Union office and I will\nput you in touch with him.\nCOMMEMORATION DAY This annual event takes place on Thursday,\nOctober 25th. All members of the college are\ninvited and admission to the degree ceremony\nat the Royal Albert Hall and the following\ntea is free. Note: to get the free tea you are\nexpected to attend the ceremony! In the evening the Commemoration Day Ball is held. For the second year running this will take place\nin College Block. The price is \u00a35.50 a double\nticket and this includes a five course meal\nwith sherry, dinner wines and port. Also provided is a late bar (approx. 2 the next morn-ing), a dance band, cabaret and discotheque.\nThis is the first formal event of the year and is\nan excellent introduction to this aspect of\ncollege life. Tickets are limited and last year it\nwas a complete sell-out well in advance, so get\nyour tickets early. They are available from\nJen (Union Clerk) in the Union office.\nU. G.M. As you will soon find out, these happen at\nfrequent intervals throughout the year. They\nare supposedly the most important meetings\nwithin the Union. Through these, elections are\nheld, policy decided and numerous debates\nheld. For the sake of the Union it is important that you attend all U.G. Ms. The first one\nwill be held this Thursday, October 4th in the\nGreat Hall, College Block at 1.00. Among the\nitems to be discussed are entertainments,\nChile, S. Africa, Grants Campaign, as well as\nelections for numerous posts. Before you\ncome, however, please read carefully the\nstanding orders for Union Meetings which\nwill be found on page 45 of the Union Blue\nBook.\nUNION DIRECTORY This year there will be a Union Directory,\nTo be of most use it is necessary for this to be\npublished as soon into term as possible. This\nis an urgent plea for information. All clubs,\nsocieties, bodies and anyone who has reason\nto believe he/she should be included in this\ndirectory are asked to send me information as\nto their name, address, telephone no., etc. If\npossible I would like this information before\nOctober 10th. PARKING Parking space at Imperial College is limited\nand because of this it is the policy of the\nUnion to choose the applicants on the merit\nof each application. Parking application forms\nare available from the Union office and these\nshould be filled in and completed on or before\nFriday, 5th October. On the 6th and 7th at\nOctober the Union parking committee will\nmeet and consider the applications and a list\nof successful people should be published in the\nFelix edition of Tuesday, 9th October with\ndetails of how to obtain the permits.\nThere are areas within the college precincts\nspecifically allocated for- motor-cyclists. In\nparticular these include an area to the south\nof Linstead Hall, west of the P.O. in Imperial\nInstitute Road and behind the Physics build-ing. Motor-cyclists are asked to keep to the\nmarked areas and to refrain from parking between cars.\nREGISTRATION CARD On the back of your yellow registration\ncard you will find two sets of boxes. At the\nbottom there are seven numbered 1\u20147, These\nare crossed off when you vote in college elections. At the top there are 15 boxes lettered\nA \u2014 P. These are crossed off when you buy\ndiscount tickets for the large I.C. Ents concerts held in the Great Hall.\nContinued on Page 3 column J "

Throughout the following week articles trickle in, are\nsub-edited and sent for typing. The page layouts are concocted and\nsent by special messenger (P.O. for short) to our printers, Baileys.\nThe type is then sot, the proofs returned for checking and finally\nFELIX is printed to reach us on the Wednesday before publication.\nOn arrival at the printers the photos are separated from the\ncopy and sent to the room shown below. In this photo the\nmachine operator can be seen setting up the raw material\nfor making a photographic block. The photo is placed\nunder the plate, and the machine arm is lowered. Hey Presto,\nten minutes later, a plate, wonderful stuff this science you\nknow.\nThat is the theory; now for the practice. O.K. Day one is the day\nof recovery and conception; the editor sits in the press room with\nthe rest of his staff, scratching his head and saying \" Well lads, what\nshall we put in the next one?\" This process continues sporadically\nbetween pints until the weekend when the first pages have to be sent\nIto Baileys.\nAt this point the press room telephone glows red with constant use\nas the reporters and other contributors are chased for their articles.\nWhen the articles, mainly features at this stage, finally arrive they\nare sub-edited and typed, then the fun starts.\nThe articles, now readable, are proof read and instructions relating\nHo size and type of print, column width and other mysterious instructions are included for the benefit(?) of the type setters. The layout\nof each individual page is then decided upon.\nThis is the- real hairy stage of the process \u2014 trying to squash or\nstretch each article to fit the available space, decide roughly the\nshape and size of the photographs which depends on the subject and\ni the aesthetic tastes of the editorial staff.\nThese conceptions are then transferred into semi reality on the <\nlayout sheets which then accompany the copy to the printers.

NO PENS ?\nNO PAPER? NO FILES ?\nNO SCARF? NO DRA\\t ING INSTRUMENTS ?\nTHEN DON'T GOTO LECTURES; COME TO IC BOOKSHOP AND GET ALL THAT AND A LOT\nMORE BESIDES!\n(You'd be surprised)\nFROM LAYOUT TO PROOFS The copy or the actual wording of\nthe articles, however, follows a different process and is taken to the\ntype setters. In the photo on the far\nleft, one can see the various linotype\nmachines in the background which\nare used for setting the type. In the\nforeground of the same photograph\ncan be seen the pages of type,\nphotos, etc., being set in their frames\nready for printing. The type is set by\ntwo different means, depending on\nthe size and style of type face being\nused. The large letters are set by\nhand from ready made type one\nletter at a time and this process is\nshown in the photograph directly\nabove. The two photos to the left\nshow how the bulk of the type is\nset by linotype machine. Each letter\nhas its own individual die or matrix.\nThese are selected by the keyboard\nfrom the magazine which can be\nseen at the top of the upper photo.\nThe words and spaces formed in this\nway are assembled in a line, which\nwhen complete forms a mould into\nwhich is pumped a molten alloy of\nlead, tin and antimony, which forms\nthe actual print used to produce the\nnewspaper. The line is then trimmed\nand ejected on to the storage galley\n(which can be seen above the keyboard in the photo bottom left). The\ndies used to mould the lines are then\nreturned automatically to their respective spaces in the storage maga-zines. As a large number of magazines are available, many different\nsizes and styles of type can be used\nsuch as BOLD, ROMAN, ITALIC.\nWhen the pages are set up, the type\nis inked and proofs returned to\nFELIX for cheeking.\n\n"

Realising the huge debt been eaten away by in flat that was mounting up on\nthe catering side of the\nrefectory services, the\nRefectory Committee had\ndrawn up for its meeting\nof 21st May a series of\nfive proposals for stopping\nthe loss. These suggested\nprice increases of between\nzero and 7| per cent.\nThese increases have\nbeen necessitated, from\nthe College point of view,\nbecause of the soaring\ncost of food in the last\nyear which shows little\nsigns of abatement in the\ncoming term.\nAlthough hardly a surprise this news must come\nas a shock to many students despite the extra \u00a340\nfor the year just started,\nwhich some claim has\nion already.\nthere is no motion up before the U GM on this\nquestion at the time of\ngoing to press (a week\nago) and President Norm Sayles said, \"It's difficult\nto know what else we can\ndo apart from accept the\nincrease.\"\nThe increase advised by\nthe Board of Governors\ncould have been more if\n\u00a36,000 hadn't been taken\nfrom two 'emergency'\nfunds to help cover the\ncosts of replacements and\nrepairs.\nThe President will be\nchecking over the recommended new prices to ensure that the 5 per cent\nrise is not surpassed.\nFree Books!\nFree Records!\nFree Films!\nFree Plays!\nFree books, records, theatre and film tickets are\nYOURS for the asking from the FELIX office.

Subjects debated at\nrecent conferences in clude grants, student re-presentation, housing,\nunion autonomy, enter-tain ment s, gay rights.\nAs you probably know,\ngrants is at the moment\na priority of the National\nUnion and will almost\ncertainly be debated\nagain in December.\nMotions submitted\nby individual unions,\nknown as Constituent\nOrganisations, have to\nreach NUS Headquarters\nby Friday, October 5 th, thus a final decision has\nto be taken on the views\nImperial College Union wants to put to NUS at\nthe Union General Meeting on Thursday, October 4 th. Any member of\nICU is entitled to put\nforward a motion to be\ndebated at this U GM \u2014\nin this case the text of\nmotions should reach\nPaul Wadsworth in the\nUnion Office as soon as\npossible.

He went\non to say that the link\nwith ARPA should mean\nadvantages for both sides\nas computer night time\ncan be used by the other\nhemisphere.\nIt is hoped to form further links with other European countries later on,\nand to increase the number of terminals in Britain to 24.\nHe said that there was\nnot much likelihood of a terminal for general use\nbut consideration will be\ngiven to projects especially if they involve languages or programmes not\navailable in this country.\nThe project, jointly\nsponsored by the Institute\nof Computer Sciences, the\nNational Physical Laboratory and the Post Office,\nis being led by Professor\nPeter Kirstein of the Institute's computer systems\nand programming depart-ment.\nAlready research groups\nfrom Cambride, Heriot\nWatt, Essex, Durham and\nsome London colleges including I.C. have expressed interest in the scheme.\nThe link is from the\nS RC's360/195 computer\nat the Rutherford Laboratory via Norway to the\nARPA network in the\nU.S. For the first year the\nlink to Norway is being\npaid for by the Post Office,\nbut later on it is hoped\nthe finance will come from\nthe universities.\nThis link may give access to far larger storage\nfacilities than are at present available in this\ncountry, Tor example the\n1 LEA C4 computer, part\nof the ARPA network,\ncan store up to 100 times-the amount of bits of in formation as can the\n360/195.\nCAYSOC\nbump h sent from NUS has been about gayness.\nSo if anyone wants to\nfind out about how to\nrun a gay soc or gay discos or read up about gay-rights or where you can\nbuy or produce gay mags, then contact Dave Sinclair, Deputy President\nICU, who has it all at his\nfingertips.\nIC/NERC\nProfessor Alan Skempton, professor of civil engineering at Imperial College has been appointed to\nthe National Environment\nResearch Council.

It would have been nice if I had had the time and space to write a longer article\non the theory of student\nCommunity action. I hope to be able to do this later on in the term.\nThe group was forme d out of trie College's Organisation for Social Service in December1971. The name change was to signify a change in the emphasis from a narrow\" do gooding\" group to a more politically aware action one. There are many difficulties involved in a Change of>this sort in\nImperial College, such as not being situated in\nan area which faces the\nproblems most other\nareas in London are faced with and an unwillingness among students at IC to face up\nto the political imp li c ation of what is hap pe ning around them. The first of these difficulties\nis overcome because we have contact with\npeople in areas like\nNorth Kensington and North Westminster and most of the students at\nIC do not live in South Kensington. Now perhaps is a good time to outline the\npresent activities of the\ngroup and some of the\npossible future ones. A play group goes for outing in group's van every\nSaturday and Sunday afternoon, with children from North Kensington. The play group\nhave also been for several weekends at a cottage in the country. On Wednesday afternoons\nthe van is used for outings for children from\nadventure playgrounds. Both these activities\nneed drivers and help-ers. Students have also\nvisited adventure play-grounds as helpers during the term time and extra help has been provided for such events as Bonfire nights\nand Christmas parties.\nSeveral of our members including myself have\nworked on summer play schemes. A soup run has taken soup to the dos s ers at\nCharing Cross on a Friday night regularly for\nthe past year and it is now hoped to run one on a Wednesday night\nas well.\nOld people in the Chelsea and Ken sing ton areas are being visited by students, after\na bad start last year it is hoped that this activity\nwill expand this year.\nThe group organises several decorating weekend work camps each term, during which old people's homes in\nNorth Kensington have\nbeen decorated. We have also helped Westminster self-help\nhousing, who area legal squatting group.\nThe original finance for\nthis group was from an IC Rag, and assistance in duplication and sur-vey s has been provided. There is the possibility of helping with an alternative local paper in Paddington and in\nproviding assistance in\nsetting up a women's centre in the same area.\nAlso I would like to\nstart up a group to res e arch the housing position of students in\nthis college to find out such things as where they live, how much they pay and what housing difficulties they\nhave.\nThat's really a brief\noutline for further information. See you at the fresher s' fair, the fresh-ers' meeting on Thur s day, 4th October in the Biology Common Room( under the Union Arch on the left), or in our office near the Union Bar most lunchtimes.

You are not alone in con>\ning fresh to IC for we have a new rector: Sir Brian Flowers, following the retirement of Lord Penney this\nyear.\nImperial College was formed by one of the earliest\ntripartite 'agreements when the Royal College of\nScience, City and Guilds Institute and Royal School of Mines decided that as they all cohabited the same patch\nof bog in prehistoric South Kensington they might as\nwell merge and pool their facilities.\nThe inter-collegiate wars that occurred as a result of\nthat amalgamation have since subsided and are nowadays mainly fought on the battlegrounds \u2014 sorry,\nsports pitches \u2014 at Harlingiton, and in the pinching of\nviolate mascots.\nSuch constituent college chauvinism can have very\nconstructive results, e.g. monster RAG collections, and the occasional lapse if it impinges on federal bodies\nlike ICU. Freshers' week is under way now in tj he Union building and is the only chance you'll have of getting\nfree membership to clubs and societies. We have over\neighty here at IC which cover all possible interests,\nhowever deviant. So do join and remember IC doesn't aim at producing academic automatons, or it wouldn't grant so much money for i the social and political sides\nof student life.\nAlthough the inequality of i the sexes at IC can produce problems for both sides, there is a lot of social\nliaison with the numerous women's colleges in the area\nand helps ameliorate the situation.\nAnyway these should be three of the most interesting\nyears of your life and when you will have the chance\nto get involved in more varied pursuits than at any other time. So, there it is, go ahead and above all, enjoy\nyourself.\nTf you feel like writing any impressions you have of\nyour first few days at IC, comments, criticisms or what-ever, then please address them to the Editor, Felix and\npop it into the Felix pigeon'hole in the outer. Union office.\nMany thanks \u2014 Ali. INSURANCE\nAND THE ICPGG\nThe chances of any student having a serious accident whilst working in the College are very\nremote, and probably few people reading this\narticle will have seri-ou sly considered the consequence of what\nmight happen if they do. But although accidents can't be prevented entirely, their unfortunate\nside effects can be minim is e d.One of these side\neffects is financial. If a student is unable to attend College, after four\nweeks the grant is\nhalved and after eight\nweeks it is stopped al together. The implications of this could be very serious especially if the student has no outside financial sup-port.\nThe I.C. Post G radu ate Group( ICP GG) brought this to the attention of the College, and the College Authorities have agreed to\ntake out an insurance policy which will enable students to be paid \u00a310\nper week for up to two years in the event of an accident preventing the student from attending\ncollege. There are also\nlump sum payments which will be made in the event of death or loss of limbs, etc. Further details should be available at registration.\nThe policy covers all students, not just post-graduates, and is the result of a year long campaign by the ICP GG. If you area new post-graduate, having just\ncollected your grant\ncheque, you may not be quite sure whether or not you have a London Weighting on your grant. Let me assure you, YOU HAVE NOT! Undergraduates do, staff do, but not post-grads. You may wonder what you can possibly earn by demonstrating. Well, you could earn \u00a31\nper hour or \u00a31.50 per hour depending on which department you are in. If your department only pays \u00a31 per hour, YOU ARE MIS SING OUT! If you would like to\nhelp overcome some of\nthese anomalies and find out more about the work of the ICP GG, you are welcome to come to its first OPEN MEE TING of the year on TUESDAY,9 th OCTOBER at 1 p.m. in the UNION CONCERT HALL( UNION BUILDING).

ICYHA CLUB TRIP\nTO NORWAY 1973\nHaving proved that it\nwas possible to cram nine people, associated tents, camping stoves,\nI C68X es, rucksacks AND three weeks food\ninto a12 seater Transit,\nwe pulled slowly away\nfrom the Union Arch. We were heading initially for the hover port at Ramsgate and then\nnorthwards through Europe to Denmark and the ferry to Oslo. The crossing of the Ska ger rak took about nine\nhours and with sunshine all the way we were soon roasting\nquite nicely on the sun deck.\nThe campsite in Oslo was two miles from the\ncity centre, surrounded by lakes and woodland, a pleasant change from\nLondon! The following\nday was spent sight-seeing, visiting the Kon Tiki and Viking-ship\nmuseums, and swim ming in Oslofjord.\nOne day's drive took\nus to the Jotunheim en or \" Land of Giants\" reg-ion. The roads began to\ndeteriorate the further\nwe travelled from Oslo and the final 2 0 km to the mountain \" hy tte\" at\nSpiterstulen were along\na narrow dirt track that\nhad to be negotiated all\nthe way in bottom gear,\nowing to the large num ber of hairpin bends and pot hoi es. Spiterstulen is a good centre for climbing the highest mountain and the highest peak in\nNorthern Europe, Gald iio piggen and Glittertind. The map shows that their heights are2469 m and2470 m re-spec t iv ely. However, the\ntop of the Glitertind is covered by a large\nsnow-cap and the exact\nheight varies according to conditions. The day after arriving at Spiterstulen we staggered out of our tents fairly early and set\noff for the Glittertind.\nWe reached the top four\nhours later, wearing only shorts in the blistering heat.\nFor our assault on Galdh o piggen we went\nwith a guide so that we could traverse the glacier on the way up. Having donned cramp on s and been roped together we headed slowly through the spectacular ice formations\nbefore ascending the snowfield and the final\nclimb to the summit.\nUnfortunately we were unable to reach the top as the weather had wor-se ned, with the wind approaching gale-force.\nOur next stopping place was And al snes in\nRoms dal. Here, we got\nour first glance of the\nincredible Troll Wall,\nalthough the. top of the\n5000 ft. high cliffs were partially obscured by cloud. A few wet days followed and we visited\nA lesund and Trondheim before returning\nto And al snes to camp at the top of the Trollstigen, the Troll's Way, with the Stigfoss\n(waterfall) plunging2000 ft. down into the valley only a few yards away.\nWe camped for three\nnights with the spectacular mountains B is pen, Kong en and Dr on ning en( Bishop, King and Queen) dominating the skyline.\nWe waited for a clear day before setting off\nfor the back of the Troll\nWall. After floundering\nabout in two or three\nfeet of very recent snow we reached a gully be tween B reid tin d and the first peaks of the Wall \u2014 Stab ben and Klum pen. One by one we gingerly approached the edge of the cliff to\ntest the theory that a snowball thrown from\nthe top would hit nothing before reaching the\nvalley 4500 ft. below.\nAfter Roms dal we drove southwards to\nGeir anger in the true\nfjord country and then\non to Olden and the\nB rik s dals bre glacier.\nThis glacier flows down from the Jos ted als breen ice-cap and as we arrived great chunks of\nice were breaking off at\nthe bottom of the glacier and falling into the lake below.\nWe left Olden and camped around Vos s, visiting the beautiful\nLysefjord with its over-hanging Pulpit Rock. With our three weeks nearly over we drove on to Kristian s and and sailed for Harwich with\nFred Olsen. Norway has plenty to\noffer the climber, walker and fisherman (unfortunately we were not\ntoo successful in this\nlast pursuit) and it is\nhoped that it will be possible to return next\nsummer. B is pen and the\nimpressive Roms dal shorn are two targets for\n\" next time\". Closer to home, theY. H.A. Club is visiting\nthe Brecon Beacons, Dartmoor, and the Peak District this term.
