    "content": "Fit IX\nMichael Williams THE EASTER vacation is now upon\nus and for many it is a very welcome\nrespite from their academic labours: a breathing period in which those problem\nsheets and project reports which are\nstill outstanding can be finally tackled\nand then laid to rest without the d is traction of lectures, lab periods etc.\nBut for a handful of students who are\ndistributed throughout the country, the\nvac will prove to be a time for bold\nrhetoric, four io us nail-biting and subtle\nwheeling and dealing as their mettle\ncomes under close sc ru ting. For it is\na the Easter Conference at Llandudno\nApril7 th11 th that the elections for\nthe National Union of Students Executive will take place. Only those delegates elected from each member stud-ents' union will be entitled to vote.\nThis year the Broad Left' s on the\nNUS Exec is being challenged by \" moderates\" who believe the NUS should be\nmore democratic in their elections by\nhaving a nation-wide secret-ballot.\nThis, they believe, would make NUS\ntruly representative of the students of\nthis country .\nThe Broad Left, in reply, have said\nthat a nation-wide ballot would be too\nvulnerable to rich students, for example,\nwho might try to buy their way to power\nwith expensive publicity. Anyway, they\ncontinue, the NUS has been developed\nas a federal institution with delegates\nelected from each constituent organisation to help decide policy at conferences - it should stay that way.\nThus a controversy rages, and, as\nin all good controversies, different solutions emerge depending on which particular criterion for resolution happens\nto take your fancy at any given moment.\nIt is perhaps unfortunate that Negative Democracy (ie \"because the people do not object to this view, then it is\nclearly what they really want\") can\nonly be beaten by active participation,\nbecause, considering the state of student apathy, the latter is a non-starter.\nI believe the only way in which the\nquestion of genuine representation can\never be resolved is to hold a nationwide referendum. This would leave no\ndoubts in anyone's minds as to what\nthe students in this country want. Only\nthose who would expect to lose something in a referendum would totally reject the idea.\nLK TTE ft S Chauvinist!\nMechanical\nEngineering Dept.\nImperial College.\n14th March, 1975.\nDear Sir,\nMay I congr atu alte Mess rs.

For those who have not,\nit is a double album's worth of other art-is ts' tracks on which Duane Allman plays\nguitar or dobro \u2014 artists ranging from\nDelaney & Bonney through Wilson Pic kett to (would you believe?) Lulu. Two\ntracks are actually credited to Duane\nAllman, and both are previously unreleased (is it too i rr ever ant to say 'one\ncan see why?'), as are four others on the\nalbum. My favourite tracks are those on\nside 4 by the Allman Brothers Band, followed closely by a Boz Scaggs track,\n\"Waiting for a train\", on side3. Duane's excellent playing is little in\nevidence on many of the tracks, however,\nand especially as there is often another\nguitar player, I feel that the dredging-up\nof these old recordings is not really a fitting tribute. But for those who may\nwish to make a collection of anything he\nplayed, this will be a worthwhile asset.\nIj [ili i^S John Andrews iris Murdoch: The Black Prince\n(Penguin).\nTHIS IS Ms Murdoch's fourteenth\nbook; although it's the first piece of her\nwork which I 've sampled she already enjoys a considerable reputation as a writer of Intelligent, Intricate novels,\nand I'm sure many of her books are well known to some of the people reading\nthis. 'The Black Prince' refers to the\nhero of the story, an aging writer from\nwhose point of view the book is written;\nbut it also is a subtle pseudonym for a rather more ether lal figure, the identity\nof whom I am not going to reveal. The\nwriter becomes involved in an unsettled\nlove affair In which the eternal triangle\nIs expanded into a pentagon; and yet\neven when everything appears settled a startling event occurs which throws the\napparent simplicity of the preceding\nstory into an entirely different perspective altogether, and we are left undecided\non the sub|ect of the writer's honesty\nand, more to the point, sanity.1 wouldn't advise reading It If you're feeling depressed as Its a very melancholy book,\nbut otherwise I can recommend it.\nPhillip Webber Brindsley le poe r Trench: Mysterious\nVisitors (Pan)\nB RINDS LEY le poe r Trench tries to\ncover everything remotely concerning\nU.F.O.'s( Unidentified Flying Objects),\nin one book so begins at a disadvantage.\nHe firmly believes in Alien visiting Earth, Telepathy, Teleportation, Moon\nBoxes, Alien Mind Influence and genetic\nbreeding with human beings. He makes\nwhat is to my mind a tactical error in a book trying to prove something; of asserting these 'facts' first then finding ' evidence'. All un explain able events thus become evidence.\nBeginning with the USAF Condon\nReport on UFO's which he alleges is a CIA cover-up of the facts, the book then\ntends to the para-psychological, with\nhuman beings meeting aliens, visionary\nexperiences, psychic phenomena etc. Even a sum is e that the \"Younger Generation\" is a mixed race of Aliens/Humans\ninterbred somehow.\nHere my brain becomes confused by\nAlien Influences, Good for breaking the\nice at parties.\nJames Wei lard: The Search for Lost\nWorlds (Pan)\nThe factual basis for Atlantis, Eden,\nthe Queen of Sheba, The Amazons, The\nCasoiterides (Britain), and Avalon are\nall well researched and the facts clearly\ngiven.

But to do that would\nbe to adopt a superficial and possibly\nsnobbish mien, so let us peer closer at\nthis deliberately un traditional kind of\nplay.\nThe director, Mark Frank, states in\nthe program that the audience should\n' 'have no preconceptions and )ust accept\nthe sights and sounds according to how\nthey entertain and per haas enlighten you\".\nNo advice is given on just how one can\ndispense with a lifetime's preconceptions in the amount of time given between\nreading the statement and the beginning\nof play. As for the play itself, interest in\nthe \" plot\" is essentially precluded: interest has to focus on the dialogue and\nthe juxtaposition of the characters.\nTwo teddy boys Fa k and Cone clearly\nlive in fear of a rival gang (who never\nappear) and exult in feelings of\nviolence. They are joined by an American, Dean and a young girl, Dodo, and\nare dominated by the fierce Greta .\nThey are inarticulate and express\nthemselves in disjointed phrases, exclamations and rhythmic quasi-incantations\nwhich are emphasised by Steve, the commentator using a set of percussion instruments. As the two ' ted s', Eric Stovell and\nSteve Randall come across suitably dil dish although their stances did appear a little strained at times. Kevin Austin\nprovided a moral portrayal of Dean and\nKaren Willis did a fine job as the pathetic Dodo whilst Sfeve Grove ably breezed through the part of the indifferent\ncommentator.\nAs Patty, Moira Robinson clearly\nshowed that she has a wealth of talent\nwhich awaits the right director to exploit it. Her attempt to appear au fait\nwith cigarette smoking was a gem .\nHowever, the honours for this production must go to Penny Pyke who, as\nGreta, displayed a stunning mastery of\napproach and delivery which electrified\nthe audience and put the rest of the cast\nto shame.\nAt the end of the play, Greta gives\nbirth to a child and is evidently an embodiment of the Hindu goddess, Kali. The\nepi graph of the play apparently is,\" All\ncreation is the sport of my Mad Mother,\nKali\" - profound symbolism indeed.\nIn conclusion, let it be said that this\nproduction is indeed an ambitious one.\nDramsoc have managed to pull it off -just.\n\n"

    "content": "Ft l' X3 The Wizard will Fall Alan Little ford AS MANY readers of FELIX may be unaware of the greatest\nrevelation In the history of human thought, I feel it my duty to\nexpound the activities of the official Wizard of the University of\nNew South Wales, and to delight your readers with news of his\namazing cosmological discoveries.\nIan Brachenburg Channel!,\nBA Hons Sociology and Psychology( Leeds 1963) - was\nofficially appointed Wizard to\nthe University of New South\nWales in 1969. In 1971 he set\nup the \"Wizards Cosmological\nResearch and Development\nCentre' in the Department of\nLevity at the University of\nMelbourne - to which he has\nsince been made offical Cosmo loge r. Many years of intense intellectual activity have enabled the Wizard, ably assis ted by theoretical physicist\nDerek C. Banks, to put forward\na new working model of the\nUniverse - the \"Complete\nRevised Post-Modern Cosmology\" \u2022 which is essentially\na new synthesis of physical\nand meta physical laws.\nTo verify the validity of\nthis New Cosmology the Wizard is preparing for THE GREAT EXPERIMENT. In this experiment the Wizard, at an exact time in 1975\nstill to be fixed, will journey\nto the Antipodes Island, some\n400 miles from N.Z. From this\nIsland (which is diametrically\nopposed to a point off the\nFrench coast) the Wizard, after\na period of merry making, will levitate into the air and van-ish. Passing through the centre of the universe (which is\nalso the centre of levity and\nHeaven - a coral la ry of the\nNew Cosmology), he will appear triumphant In the English\nChannel 42 minutes later. To\nprevent his untimely demise a recovery fleet (including a yacht from IC) is being prepared to greet him and simultaneously raise the level of\nlevity on the high seas.\nHaving completed the major\npart of his great opus, the Wizard has been giving greater\nattention to the re ll go us aspects of the expression of\nCosmological truths. He first\ndevised a mathematical proof\nthat he willed himself to be\nborn at a particular time and\nplace; and that there coordinates were not, as most modern\ncosmologies would have of a necessarily random nature.\nThe second major outcome of\nthe Wizard's investigations\nwas his acceptance of the role\nan rf tl tle of \"Tthe Prophet\"\n(In the mainstream Israelite\ntradition).\nAs \"The Prophet\", the\nWizard sees his main aim as\nhalting the world-wide religion\nof materialist economic pro-gres s, generally timed International Socialism or International Capitalism, depending on the system by which\nthe means of production are\nlegitimated. To achieve this\naim the Wizard Intends to re-vital is e \"The Faith\" of the\nBritish peoples in Her Majesty\nthe Queen, basing this thesis\non the stability resulting from\nthe balance of power achieved\nby the binding by oath of various legal, re li go us philo soph ical, executive and representative institutions in Britain to\nthe re li gou sly legitimated constitutional Monarch. The government resulting from such a system has proved to be impervious to the manu eve rings by materialists in the form of\nsocial og is ts,p hy s cho logi sts and economists, who, with the\nhelp of party politicians and\nmass media controllers, busily\nattempt to engineer the \"voice\nof the people\" to put themselves in positions of complete totalitarian authority.\nOur reporter writes: Those who attended last weeks Wizard Wellsoc lecture were treated to a mental trip away from\nour normal conception of the\nuniverse, into one in which the\nEarth is on the inside of a sphere, with the rest of the\nuniverse in the central region.\nIf light travels in a curve, the\nphysical laws are the same,\nand this universe is indistinguishable from ours. Whether\nthe purpose is a serious experiment or an exercise to encourage irreverence towards\nour a priori universal model\nwas not clear, but to become a Wizard devotee is not difficult\nand the concepts are fun.\nFurther de tai Is from: The\ndepartment of levity, University of Melbourne, Parkville,\nVictoria 3052, Australia; or\nAl Littleford and Murray Ward\nin TIzard Hall.\nFOUND\nOne black diary, no name owner appears to be involved in\nUL U sports.

    "content": "4 FELIX\nBRIGHTON TRIP '75\nBy Colin Andrew\nTHE ANNUAL RSM trip to the seaside at Brighton has al ways been an event the Police of this district have viewed with\nsome trepidation. This year was to be no exception. The trip\nstarted in the 'Queens' after the elections at about 2.00pm, the\nPresident elect, Mr Brayshaw reputedly 'getting a dozen gins\ndown his neck'. The53 members of the merry band then\ntrooped back to Mines to board\nthe coach and to quench their\nthirst with the barrel on board;\nwithin a very short distance\nthis began to take effect. With\nmuch shouting of \"stop the\nbus, we want a wee wee\", the\n.driver consented and a long\nqueue, formed outside Wimbledon Council's major tourist\nattraction.\nRelief was only short lived\nas more beer was consumed\nalong with champagne and a small amount of food. Again the driver eventually consented and as no urinal was in\nsight we lined up against a fence and 'painted parabolas'\n- much to the embarrassment\nof school-girls walking past.\nThis stop saw Mr Brayshaw\nattempting to p*** on a sparrow at the top of a tree. Boarding the coach again the call came for Mr Brayshaw to zum-ba which he did accordingly\nand following this there came\nyet another cry for relief, esp-ec i ally from Bob Longman\"these anti-water retention\npills are killing me\". Luckily this time the driver also was\ndesperate so we stopped outside a farm, most people\nthought the wall was good\nenough but the President elect\nentered the farm yard and reappeared with a muddy addition to his trousers.\nWe eventually reached\nBrighton In high spirits at\nabout 6.30pm and everyone\nstreamed across the park ( a few collecting button-holes of\ndaffodils) to the ' King and\nQueens' where most discussed the strategy for the evening.\nBeing desperate for food we\nset off in search of this pro-ble m, and succeeded In finding c hippies, Chinese restaurants and sea-food stalls( jellied eel doesn't stay down\nvery seel!). The more ex per in e ced of the merry-makers\nthen pro ceded to the ' Bosun's' in search of what is colloquially known in Mines, as\nRat Tart. Several pints later a traumatic discovery was made;-horror of horrors - there was\nno door on the bog. This finished us at this particular\nestablishment and people split up into smaller groups.\nLater in the evening saw\never so slightly inebriated\nMiners coalescing on the pub\nknown as ' Dr Brighton's.' This was the pub to which\nlast year we returned two mirrors borrowed from here the\nyear before that, embellished\nwith small plaques reading\n'Stolen and returned by RSM\n1974\". At about 10.30pm the\nmanager decided that he no\nlonger needed our custom and\nsome of our band were ejected.\nAbout now, Jamie Bell was\nseen staggering around shouting (In s couse) \"Ar yer corn-in' on a ramp?\" This was the\nbattle cry to go borrowing\nsigns from the sleepy streets\nof this quaint town. After last\nyears fracas with the High\nSherriff of Sussex we had decided to be more selective, so restaurants, pubs and the sea front where our prime object-ive.\nHowever it came to our\nnotice that Mr Brayshaw, in\nkeeping with tradition, should\ngo for a swim, due ly he was\nescorted down the beach and\nthrown into the now icy sea. Emerging he was courteously\nwrapped up in coats and taken\nto a nearby shop doorway to\nftp %i:/t t?m\\. Mp:M& if Iff Iff!> vS#li?\n:Kffll\nrecover. This appeared to be\nthe meeting place for many of\nour band, and out of dark corne ms various criminal types\nappeared with strange shapes\nunder their coats. The coach\neventually arrived and we\ntrooped on board, Nick d is covered he had lost his wal let so the cavalry was sent\nout and duly returned success fully. A certain member, who\nshall remain name ls s, left the\ncoach and hung his posterior\nover the sea wall to lessen\nhis load then turned around\nand puked on top of the mountain below.\nBoh Longman, not to be\noutdone by Nick Brayshaw,\nthen decided to go for a swim\nvoluntarily and had to be carried back on board the coach.\nWhen on the coach he did a marvelous impersonation of a zombie as Pat Gorman changed\nhis dripping clothes. About\n11.45 pm we were nearly ready\nto set off when the news arrived that Steve Maw had been\narrested for borrowing street\nlamps but was later released.\nThe coach left at about midnight with a good load of\nsigns.\nThe trip back, although\nuneventful for some, was very\nentertaining for those watch ing them; Fred Tutcher slept\nalmost the entire way back.\nHe was totally unaware of the\npound note rolled up in his mouth, the coins balanced on\nhis eyelids, and the paper cup on his head. After a couple of\npuke stops we reached Mines\nat about 2.45am. The few who managed to\nget in to college the next morning commented on each others\nble ari ness but remembered\nlittle of what was a very fine\ntrip, I think?\nMINES REVUE\nTHE MINES Revue stormed enthusiastically into action last\nMonday night to present entertainment without recourse to a stripper, drag artiste or blue films which are a regular feature at\nthe other C CU revues. In the end, the gamble to forego the hired\nhelp of outside 'entertainers' paid off. For although the smoky,\ncrowded, intimate atmosphere\nwhich tends to prevail in other\nrevues was missing, the effort\nand organisation was II there\nto ensure that whatever happened this year Mines Revue\nIs established on a firm footing as an annual event.\nTrue, the vast majority of\nthose appearing in the sk etc hes have had practically no previous experience of revues\nand this aspect was manifest-ed in the hesitation and uncertainty which characterised\nsome of the first-half sketches. Nevertheless, valuable\nlessons have been learned.\nThe Revue gathered momentum\nas it went along and there\nwere some excellent ideas\nwhich had clear potential - the\nonly things really lacking\nwere punchlines which are the\nessence of a good finish to a sketch. In conclusion it must be\nsaid that whilst this event\nwas a good revue but not a great revue, it must be quite\nclear to Mines that with so\nmuch potential having been\nexposed on that night, the outlook for next year must be\nvery encouraging indeed.\n\n"

WEEKS HALL REOPENS\nFLOOD 1\nIN THE TOILETS OFF THE UNION BAR LAST FRIDAY there was a Union Bar. Water was gushing all let had to be closed for a period\nNow all this water you might have expected to run in to the centre of the floor and\ndown the drain. However due\nto the clever design of the\ndrain (it being at the highest\npoint of the floor) the water\ndid the opposite and collected\nround the edges. The obvious course of action would be to lower the en trance to the drain and this\nwas in fact being done when\nthe flood occured. It appears\nthat the workmen involved\nwith the re-positioning of the\ndrain used an electric drill\nwhich accidentally pierced a water pipe.\nThe damage done was not\ntoo extensive and the facility\ndoes appear to be in working\norder now. There were few\ncomplaints except from the,\noccasional murmuring s. of the\nbar patrons who had to walk\nacross the lower lounge to the\nflood in the toilets just off the\nover the place, and so the to i other place when nature demanded it. GUESTS\nSMASHED!\n40. FRENCHMEN descended up Oi vIC last Friday and unfortunately went away\" broken\nand dejected. Guess who tan\nall over them on the sports\npitch? England. A ramshackle\nIC Rugby team mass o acre d them 24-0, then a rampant(?)\nUC team finally demolished\nthem on the football pitch\n14-0. It sounds incredible -more like a rugby soc re. Still,\nthey consoled themselves over\na crate of whisky. WEEKS HALL will be re-opening in the summer term and\nstudents will be offered places only for the duration of this term.\nThere is to be no summer vacation letting in order that further\nstructural strengthening work be carried out. The progress of this\nwork will determine whether the hall will be ready again for the\nautumn term.\nThe work to be done will take approximately twelve\nmonths to complete. If the\nwork is started before the\nautumn term then the hall will be out of use for the whole of\nthe session1975/6, otherwise it will be in use for the\nfirst term of the session only.\nThis is due to the fact that\nthe alternative date of commencing will be Christmas,\n1975.\nThere are stringent conditions attached to this move\nwhich include; the Weeks Hall Bar remaining closed throughout the summer term. All res idents will also be expected to\nsign an undertaking to the\naffect that he will not introduce materials that are likely to cause explosions (for ex ample, portable gas cylinders).\nTo this and, the president of\nIC Union, Trev Phillips has been asked to recommend a number of students who would\nco-operate with the Warden to\nensure strict adherence to the\nstipulated conditions.\nAll students should receive\na letter from Trev Phillips within the next two or three\ndays outlining the conditions\nunder which they will be all o wed to stay in the hall. Whilst\nthe next phase of structural\nwork is in progress the hall\nwill have no occupants residing there. It is hoped that\nafter this second phase the\nhall will be safe to accommodate students for the following\nsession. FLOOD2 A FLOOD has been reported in one of the basement\nstorage rooms of the Union\nbuilding which is used, iron-ic ally enough, by the Underwater Club. The source of the flooding\nwas a joint in a drain-pipe\nwhich is exposed in the room.\nIt is understood that the joint\nblew out under pressure due\nto a blockage at the kitchen\nend of the fra in. A plumber\nwas called and the matter is now under control.\nFortunately for the Underwater Club, the storage room\nis split-level and so mo^t of\ntheir equipment suffered no\ndamage whatsoever from the\nwater.\nWOULD LIKE TO WISH ALL ITS READERS A HAPPY EASTER "

This years all-round dearth of can di dates within ICU struck again. However the situation was some\nwhat the reverse of ICU: there were three candidates for the\npost of ICWA President while the posts of DP, Hon. Sec. and\nHon. Jun. Treasurer were un-opposed.\nThe candidates for Pre s ident were: Kathy Conlon, Stella Godfrey, and Sue Tan ner. The TCWA lounge was\ncrowded for the actual voting\nand once this was over, there\nwas a tense wait before it was\nannounced that Stella Godfrey\ncollected the most votes with\nthe actual result being very\nclose.

The job also brought\nher into contact with the Refectory Manager and the Dome stic Bursar in College Block. She reputes the rumour that\nshe was r' put up\" by the Women in Science Group although\nshe is nevertheless s a member\nof the group and advocates\nmost of its policies. Stella\naims to create greater awareness amongst the women in\nthe college in respect of a variety of topics including the\ndifficulties many women encounter when trying to get industrial sponsorship or simply\ngetting a job. One of her major\naims is to attract more women\nto IC. This is nothing political or\nantagonistic about Stella God frey. Her approach to the\nwhole ethos of ICWA will be\none of expansion, not one of\nsubstitution or dramatic\nchange of emphasis. The soci al events are to receive more\nattention as regards improve-ment.\nOne of her more concrete\nideas is to make the ICWA\nlounge into a kind of daily\nAngela Aughwaine is in\nMaths I and comes from\nBirmingham.

Sounds fair\nenough.\nOther ideas that she hopes\nto implement next year include\nco-ordinating flat-sharing so\nthat girls who find themselves\nwithout accommodation can be\nfitted into a flat; an ICWA\nDebating Society; possibly a Family Planning Clinic in College one day a week, but this\nidea is, as\" yet, still in the\nembryo stage ('s cuse the pun).\nStella Godfrey is clearly\nall set to make next year's Women's Association a group\nto be reckoned with.

    "content": "FELIX SPORT SOCCER With the season drawing to\na close IC FootballClub can\nlook back with some satisfaction on a year of moderate succ ess. For the second consecutive season no trophies were\ncollected by any of the teams\nbut the 2nd XI reached the final of the reserves cup only to\nbe beaten 2-0 by UC II's, and\nthe first XI were runners up in\nthe premier division to Royal Holloway. In spite of this sad\nlack of glory the standard of\nfirst team football in particular has been very high and to\ncome second in a league\nwhich is more competitive now\nthan it has been for a long\ntime is a fine achievement in\nitself.\nThe second XI also on their\nday were an outstanding side. This they proved last February when they an ni lula ted the eventual league and cup\nwinners UCI Ps30. It is unfortunate that they took such a long time to find a settled\nteam and by the time they had\nthe league title was already\nout of their grasp.\nAs for the lower teams the\nseason was most diss appoint Tng in terms of games won. The third XI plagued by injury\nstarted well and even defeated\nthe second team in a league,\nmatch, but a certain amount of\napathy combined with injuries\nand the elimination of their\ncaptain Roger Hunter put paid\nto their chances of any league\nor cup success. Ken Cowan' s4 th team battled bravely throughout the season and although\nthey won only a handful of\ngames the standard of play\nwas again fairly good. Too\noften, however, the team was let down by a lack of fitness,\nsomething it is hoped that will be remedied next season. The\nfifths had a good season and\nwhat they lacked of fitness,\nsomething it is hoped that will be remedied next season. The fifths had a good season and\nwhat they lacked in skill they\nmade up for with enthusiasm\nwhich was borne out by them\nreaching the semi finals of the\nlower reserves cup. The sixths\nhad an abysmal year and will be relegated. Nevertheless all credit must be given to those\nlads who turned out week after\nweek to suffer some heavy\ndefeats.\nClean Sweep For\nIC Water Polo\n- ICI and IC II have swept the board in the UL U winter water\npolo league, the first team retaining their title (of the I st divi sion) and the second team making a dramatic rise from bottom of\nthe second division to the top.\nIC Ists had very little opp osi tion, except a strong London\nteam against whom we lost one\nand won one. The success of\nthe team is due to the strength\nof the forwards Lewis, Hindle, Freeze, and Smith (all in the\nUL U first team as well), the\ntwo strong backs Taylor and Lowther, and a brilliant di splay of goal keeping by Ili c also in die first team.\nThe second team had a full\neleven plus extras. Special\ncredit must be given to s piri ted performances by Vaughan,\nPhaedon, and M. Said, the top\nscorer in the whole of the UL U league.\nThe success of this year's second team reflects on the\nstrength in the club and it is hoped that many second team\nmembers will move up to the\nfirst team next year.\nFinally special mention\nmust be made to our international coach and trainer, C. Spooner, without whose valuable assistance the teamwork\nand skill of play would be so\nlimited.\nIst team: D.ll ic,P Hindle,\nP. Frieze, A. Smith, M. Taylor,\nR. Lewis, D. Lowther.\n2nd team: 1.Bales, Angelos,\nl. Paterson, D. Mulroney, Lim,\nR. Tohiacheusky, W. Gunardine,\nM. Said, C. Beavan, T. Vaughan,\nR. Simitovic, A.

The race was run over 5000m the metric equivalent of 3 miles on a well beaten-tartan track. The back straight\nof the track had a cold wind blowing straight in the runners\nfaces, and the half inch of water on some parts of the lower bend\ndid not help them either.\nThe race started promptly\nat two-thirty, with Tractor\nHoulbrooke somewhat injured\nby earlier road relays taking\nthe times. After the first lap,\nDave Jones had pulled out a formidable lead, which was\nslowly whittled away by Paul, Rob and Hank .After the fourth\nlap a distinct feeling od deja\nvu had crept into the team and\nthe boredom of running round a flat circle became apparent.\nThe c race, and its cup,\nwas won by Rob All in son in\n15-32 with Hank Marvin coming in second, well ahead of\nPaul Clarke. The Bar Race was won, for\nthe third year running by our\nBar star, Pad Donnelly in a record time of 51.0 seconds,\nthis year, however, he was\ngiven a run for his money by\nour resident three man lift expert Bob Ignaciuk who sup-rise d everyone by recording a time of 57.6 sees. Last Saturday, the IC team\nmet the old rivals or the Old Imperial College Cross Co un try Team. The start was delayed by lack of transport\nfrom IC to Richmond Park and\neven when the extras caught a bus, they failed to get off it\nat the right stop. The course\nround Richmond Park felt as\nif it had been raining for years\ncontinuously. Why else would\nsandy tracks turn into quasi swamps? Anyway less of this\nself-pity and on with the race Barry Dabrowski won it, with\nRob All in son in second place\nand Dave Houlbrooke and Pad Donnelly ran personal worsts\nof 47.39 round a5'4 mile\ncourse. The young Imperial\nCollege team just beat the Old IC's by a mere three points.\nWe hope to improve this score-line next year to the thrashing\nthe Old IC's deserve.\nBy running in both these\nraces, and many more, Mike\nWelford won the Petersham\nPot, just beating seven or\neight people by only one\nmatch.\nPS. Mr Ellis has been getting\nadvice from Mr Payne on\niri di ology. Bedford Head\nThe Bedford Head of the\nGreat Ouse race to give it it's full title was held on Saturday\nthe 8 th. The course was short\nfor a head race (2067 m to be\nprecise) and the times were\nfast due to the fast stream.\nThe processing of the times\nwas done by computer to give\nthe results as quickly as possible which was fine except\nfor the slight detail that it got\nthem wrong. According to the\ncomputer St Ives Rowing Club came first, pretty good going\nsince they hit the bank during\nthe race .It also put Ocwridle\nSchool 3rd VIII in third place\nwhich was only 14 places\nahead of their IstVIII! Since\nit was impossible to overtake\nduring the first half of the\ncourse the 1st VIII decided to\nstart with a large gap between\nus and the crew in front (Chur-chill College Cambridge). By the end of the race we had\ncaught up by about six lengths,\nhowever the final results put\nus only six seconds ahead\nwhich implies that we were\ntravelling at over 40mph! Offi ci ally the results were as\nfollows:- l st VIII 6th( more\nlikely 3rd or 4th),2 nd VIII\n34th, Novice VIII 59th, Ladies73 rd. Kingston Head\nThis took place on Saturday 15th. This time the course\nwas much longer (about 4\nmiles). Again the conditions\nand times were very fast due\nto a weeks rain, in fact the \u2022\ncurrent was so fast that the\nfinish had to be moved 300 m upstream to avoid exhausted\ncrews disappearing over Teddington Weir. Despite being a bit untidy the l st VIII had a good row, overtaking three\ncrews before the finish and\ncoming in with the seventh\nfastest time, behind, Iris (Ox-ford II), ULI, Poplar Black wall RC I, Thames Tradesmen,\nKingston RC I and Bedford RC I. Since Kingston were late for\nthe start they were given a ten second penalty and we\nmoved up to 6th place. The second VIII were unable to row because an axel\nbroke on one of their seats on\nthe way up to the start.\nOur next event is the Tideway Head of the River Race which takes place this Saturday afternoon. With over 200\neights racing from Mortlake to\nPutney it is quite a spectacular sight. If you are still around your support would be\nwelcomed.\n\n"

IC lost the toss (it is hoped that more practice will correct this)\nand the French elected to play against the wind. The first twenty\nminutes was closely contested.\nAlthough breaks were being\nmade by the three quarters a lack of finishing deprived IC from taking the lead. The first IC try came from\ngood maul ball ten yards from\nthe French line allowing R. Hughes to hive M. Cotter a very easy try. At this stage it\nbecome obvious that the excel lent line out jumping by M. Sharrat and K.Li bs come together with superior mauling and\nnicking by IC would tip the\ngame in IC's favour.\nHowever what became even\nmore obvious was that M. Co ter in the centre had no intention of passing the ball for the\nrest of the game and to say he\nhogged the ball is a vast un-der statement. A. Williams scored next and T. Fear n scored\nunder the post after a brilliant\nindividual break from the base\nof a scrum on halfway. It was\nfortunate that Terry had not\npassed to M. Cotter as nobody\nwould have seen the ball for\nthe rest of the movement.\nHalf time Score IC16 Paris University 0. M. Cotter one\npass. Up to now B. Bradley using\niron control had kept relatively\nquiet but could now longer\nremain silent and managed to\nchop or make some comment\non nearly every decision the\nreferee made. J. Swift had a couple of good runs down the\nwing but this was only possible by employing moves which\nmissed out M Cotter. The IC backs found it easier to cope with the wind d is advantage and after twenty-five minutes scored another try\nby T. Fear n which Bradley fai led to convert. He even had\nsome comment to make about\nthis. In the last ten minutes\nthe ball found its way into M. Cotters hands. M. Sergot his fellow centre was so de spar ate at this stage that he even\noffered to buy the ball from\nCotter.
