    "content": "Death is My Trade, Cert A, German film,\nEnglish subtitles. Directed by Theodor\nTotuila. Opened Paris Pullman yesterday.\nA sombre, humour less tale that reflects its\nsubject matter; the life story of the Commandant of Auscwitz concentration camp. The\ncentral character is called Franz Lang, the\npseudonym adopted by the real life character,\nRudolf Hoss, while on the run before his trial\nand execution in 1947.\nThe film follows Lang's life from the age of\nsixteen in the First World War and shows the\nformation of his strong respect and fanatical\ndesire to obey an abstract entity: Deutschland.\nThe S S are shown in a most harrowing\nmanner, dealing with Jews as \"units\" and\nDeath is My Trade is played in a very low\nLang is given a job to do and never doubts that\nit is wrong, as authority has deemed him the\nbest man for the job. He would prefer to be\nfighting at the front but as authority want him\nto remain commandant to take care of Hitler's Final Solution, he stays on, never question ning Reichfuhrer Himmler, who has told him that\nthe Final Solution is necessary. He seeks only\nways to improve his efficiency\u2014he invents the\ngas chamber!\nDeath is my Trade is played in a very low\nkey, it steers clear of shocking news reel\nfootage, working on the principle that\neveryone already knows of the atrocities of the\nSS. It is not a film about the victims but a film\nabout the murderers, men who were not born\nto decimate a race but to whom it came with\nrelative ease whe m commanded by authority.\nMore hideous crimes have been committed\nin the name of obedience than have ever been\ncommitted in the name of rebellion. An enthralling, well-acted, very serious film.\nDuncan R. Stoop\nAlternative London. Edited by Georganne\nDowries, Kathy Holme and Max Handley.\nPrice \u00a33.50 from all (in)decent bookshops.\nAt last! The long awaited (since 1977) new\nedition of Alternative London was officially\npublished yesterday.\nAlternative London has always been a controversial book but this latest edition\ncertainly knocks spots off its predecessors.\nThis is not the book to tell you about the\nhistory of the Tower of London, but rather the\nroute of Magnox Flask traffic to Windscale.\nSubjects covered are sometimes general in\nnature and bear no real relation to London\nitself, so the text is peppered with useful\naddresses to put it back on the right track\nagain. Topics covered included squatting, sex,\nstrange religions, tax, dole, drugs (very\ncomprehensive!), etc., etc. Nothing seems out\nof place in Alternative London, it tries to be\ncomprehensive and I think it actually succeeds.\nProbably the only worthwhile book on living\n(as opposed to holidaying) in the Big City.\nThe book has information that will appeal to\nall sorts of people, though naturally the\nenthusiasts who produced it assume only left-wingers are really interested. This is my only\ncriticism (although now and again I found\nmyself doubting the validity of some of the\ninformation). Strange interesting facts abound:\ndid you know that the sex attract ant advertised in gentlemen's magazines is the\nsame as \"Boarmate\" used by farmers at a fifth\nof the price to speed up pig mating? Do you\nknow the \"best\" magistrate (by name) to be\ndone by for posse sion of grass/hash? Or that\nHitler owned 8,960 acres of Colorado. Not a lot of people know that.\nWhile the book has something for everyone\nand I wholeheartedly recommend every single\none of you to go out and buy a copy, it will no\ndoubt appeal most to those few interested in\n'Alternative IC. Perhaps we could get together\nsome day to publish it: heating tunnels, Arthur,\nWally and the Freemasons, naughty blueprints\nconfidential documents, the reflector y flat\nvoyeur, corruption in high places, the lot!\nCould be fun!\nPrisoner 1132566\nThe Annual Wellsoc Dinner\nSpeaker: Prof. Eric Laithwaite\nplus magic from Martin S.

While the Mines team travelled\nin luxury (Kev's car!), RCS and the nominal. Guilds contingent travelled by BR, allowing\nthe Mines team some psychological advantage on the range. Having completed\nthe formalities of hiring the guns, etc., the\ngroup adjourned to the 900yd range for a spot of shooting..\nOnce shooting commenced, everybody\nimmediately hit the targets with the\nexception of the esteemed Guilds team, who\nsuffered wind problems. In the afternoon\ngood scores were registered by everybody\nwith the exception of Gary Smith, with\nnotable achievements by Steve, Neill and\nTony, who notched up 47 apiece. A late\nattraction was an impromptu kneeling competition between Gary and Steve, in\nwhich Steve achieved a notable victory by\none point, thus adding to Gary's growing\ncomplex. Fashion on the range showed a good deal of imagination and dress sense with\nstunning outfits being modelled by Steve and '\nKev, with Neill's hat showing promise for the\nfuture.\nYacht\nIn the beginning there were fourteen pseudo-queasy quasi-sailors and two OOD34 yachts.\nThen God( or someone who sounded remarkably like Him) spake th unto us:\n\" Hey you guys, verily thou shalt sail eth upon the Solent.\"\nSo naturally, we went there last weekend.\nAnd lo! It blew. Twas really brill ig. Behold,\nwe had a gale to amuse th ourselves with;\nwhich we did. OK, so it's not far from\nLymington to Gosport and back again, but\n'twas a wizard caper in that wind. And lo!\nWe were amused.\nSo if you are turned on by the idea of\nwalking around wearing a rather soggy halo,\ncome to a meeting in the Botany Common Room, Beit Arch,12:30 pm Thursdays. There\nis another trip in a weekend's time, also a week's sailing in the Easter vacation, probably across to France (and back?).\nTennis\nIn the first match of the season, a weakened\nIC team, lacking match practice, were\nbeaten by Reading University first team.\nStar performances by Ralph Daud and\nRob Easton saved the day for IC, by winning\nall their matches. Christian also played well.\nMany thanks to Steve for getting out of\nbed and turning up as a last minute replacement. (I hope she kept the bed warm\nfor you when you got back!)\nTeam: R. Easton, R.

Tin English-speaking South Africans show a strong following\nto improve the standard of\nliving of blacks. My personal\nexperience suggests that this is\nlargely due to Anti-Apartheid\ndemonstrations abroad. I witnessed South Africans waiting to see rugby matches\n\" live\" at 4 : 0 0 am only to\nobserve massive demonstrations in New Zealand. Thi gave the South African public\ndrive to try to improve blacks'\nliving conditions.\nFinally I would like to\npoint out that the blacks\nthemselves called for an\ninternational boycott of South\nAfrican goods. A boycott will\ninclude sport and entertainment where media coverage is\ngreatest.\nIan R cid Geo 2\nDear Mark\nI would like, through you,\nto address the Chaplain( David Ashforth, for those not\nin the know). It seems, M rAsh forth that we are to\ntolerate the unjust way in\nwhich the South African powers that be, treat the\nmajority of people in the\ncountry, simply because it\nwould be \"unrealistic\" to do\notherwise. My mind shudders, boggles and is general lv left in a state of complete and\nutter confusion at the thought\nof living in a country deprived\nof such essentials as wedding\nrings, masonry drills, printed\ncircuits and the myriad other\nitems that your informed mind has cited. My position\nas regards to your views Mr Ashforth, is not totally di sap probationary. It does have a certain twisted logic about it.\nIs it not the case that the\nEnglish cricketers currently in\nSouth Africa needed all that\nlovely money the South Africans offered them? Given\nthis, surely it was 'unrealistic'\nto expect them to turn down\nthe offer to play in S A. Is your\nposition any different, Mr Ashforth?\n\" We can in the meantime\nconcentrate on improvements\nthat are possible\" states Mr Ashforth. You know the type\nof thing. Pressure on British\ncompanies, with ties in S. A., cultural boycotts, lectures to\nskilled tradesmen emigrating\nto S.AI mean things of\ncataclysmic and cosmic al consequence, the lull works!\nReally, Mr Ashforth....this is\nrealism? If so it is worse than\ncomplacency, it is outright\nand b latent support for the\nSouth African oppressors\n(assuming, of course, that not\nall sentient beings are afflicted\nby the type of logical thought\nthat you very evidently suffer\nfrom). I urge you Mr Ashforth\nto general is e. If you were a black South African, and were living in the present\ndc g red ation the white regime\nnow subjects you to, and you\nhad seen your parents and\nbrothers and sisters and grandparents subjected to\nsuch degradation, and were\nconscious that lor generations\nyour family had been subjected to similar and worse\ndc g red ation, would your definition, Mr Ashforth, of\n' realistic' measures against\nSouth Africa remain un changed?\nE.

An example\nof the unintelligible style is\ngiven below:\n\" Max eventually ends up\ndefending a type of city state\nwhich has sprung up around\nan oil well degenerating mechanisms being the most\nsort-after asset, and which provides, for Max, a mitigating\ncircumstance, of sorts, lor the\nensuing slaughter as he\ndecimates the hallucinogenic\nassortment of bikes, ranging,\nfrom the strangely punk-like,\nmohicans and bondage, to\nstylised gladiators, who are\nlaying siege.\"\nIt is an interesting review,\nseeming to possess the maxim um amount of commas and\nminimum number of sentences\npossible in a given length.\nWe are told in the following\nhalf paragraph that Max' s dog appears to survive:\n\" All individual characters\nexcept Max and his faithful\ndog are ultimately dispensable\nin form, with Max' s mad,\nviolent vision, derived from\npre-holocaust assumptions,\nrequiring only the occur ance of character to construe action.\"\nYet during the film, Max' s dog is quite clearly shot with a crossbow, and the two characters who survive are Max and\nthe al x nig ne hoy.\nThe review concluded b* saying the film is trash.\nMad Max 2 is not the sort ol\nfilm I would go and see but I was invited to the premier in\nChelsea and found it a gripping film and would recommend it to anyone.\nfours sincerely\nK.J.

And it is up to noone to overturn their inter-preta tion of the rules. I suppose the fact that all candidates signed a piece of\npaper that they would abide\nby election rules other than those\nlaid down by the Constitution was\nnot a valid objection!

    "content": "Cross Country\nThe penultimate race of the season, the Old Boys' Race, was held on Saturday in Richmond Park in bright sunshine. A small\ncontingent of about half a dozen present IC runners braved the competition all to no\navail, as a large majority of the first ten\nfinishers were old boys. A notable exception\nwas Hugh Dixon, our guest runner from\nQE C, who won the five mile race. As is\ntraditional, after slight numerical manipulation the result was deemed a draw.\nThe dinner that followed the run later in\nthe evening was a tremendous success with\ncopious quantities of high quality cold bullet\nedibles. Towards the end of the evening our\nCaptain, Pete Holdsworth, provided a little\nlight entertainment with his speech including\ncomments on the team and individual successes and failures during the season\ntogether with a few amusing anecdotes.\nft Hockey\nFirsts\nThis game was played on the astroturf at\nCrystal Palace against St. Johns touring side\n(full o! drunken bums!).

Kennedy and Bennett battled it\nout with the opposition whilst Dalton and\nYounghusband realising that they were now\nthe only dry crew, had encounters with the\nstarters launch and an Oxford boat before\nillustrating the technique of falling overboard\nat speed.\nWinning this race on penalty points proved too close for Oxford, who reacted by\nwinning the second race decisively and thus\ntook the match.\nTeam: Bennett, Dalton, Fawcett, Kennedy,\nIo stev in, Younghusband.\nRugby No rugby reports this week, folks\u2014so here's a photo of your Gutteridge Cup heroes instead.\n(I' hol o: Jim Edwards.)\nSports Editorial\nJust a reminder that entries for Sports Day must be in today.

    "content": "The Portage to San Cristobel of A.H. Directed by John Dexter. Mermaid\nTheatre.\nIs it possible that Hitler may still be alive?\nSome people have their fears. His last reported\nmovements left behind a trail of puzzling\nimprints and there appears to be no incontrovertible truth that he died in that\nbunker. This nagging fear is exploited in\nGeorge Steiner's fictional work The Portage to\nSan Cristobel of A.H., adapted for the stage by\nChristopher Hampton.\nThe ninety-year-old Hitler, played by Alec\nMcCowen, is found in the Brazilian jungle by a commando of Israeli agents. They secretly\nattempt to convey him to the airstrip at San\nCristobal, but the sensational news of his\ncapture is leaved out. Governments throughout the world start flapping their wings and in\nno time at all vultures are preparing to swoop\ndown for the kill. As the Jewish commandos\nhack their way through the jungle they are\ntormented by the hostility of their surroundings and by the presence of their horrifying\nprey. What possible sentence could befit the\nenormity of his crime? Would hanging him not\ncreate the illusion that the whole affair could\nbe concluded by this one act? Could he even\nbe a Jew, the Second Messiah foretold in\nJewish mystical scripts?\nMost of the time Hitler stumbles along in\nsilence, but towards the end he delivers an\nelectric self justification, an attempted vindication of his policy of racial ex termina tion, pent up but unforgiving after thirty-five\nyears of seclusion. McCowen( famous for his\ntwo hour long solo renditions of St. Mark's Gospel) plays a grizzly, stooping nonagenarian\nwho from his wasted body manages to hurl\nwords with gruff but piercing eloquence. A Alec McCown as Hitler in The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. thrilling piece of drama, his twenty-five minute\nmonologue delivers a sharp blow to one's senses. His arguments are that the Third Reich\nwas no more than a grotesque parody on the\nracism of the Jews; their obsession as being\nthe chosen people. That the utopia erected by\nthe Jews throughout their long history, and\nnotably, in the last two thousand years those\nerected by Rabbi Jesus and Rabbi Marx, are\nimpossible to achieve, would leave man permanently guilty, and bring about the\ndestruction of civilisation. And that the crimes\nof Stalin are infinitely greater than his own.\nHitler's speech enters a region of moral\nargument very plausible but very dangerous. It\nis not a vindication of Naziism but provokes a debate about good and evil, and in particular\nthat most ancient of dilemmas, does the good\nend justify the evil means? The speech exposes our own hypocrisy such as our\nalliance with Stalin in the war, a man who\nbefore had slaughtered thirty million of his own\npeople in the Russian Revolution.\nDespite the foregoing the play is not 'heavy'.\nHowever, it is a little lop-sided in that the great\nfinal speech makes the first part of the play\nseem, on reflection, a little tame. And superb\nuse is made of 'surround-sound'.\nThe theatre is close to Blackfriars tube\nstation on the district/circle line and student\nstandbys are available.\nNick Bedding\nSm4\nThe Book of Lech Walesa, various\nauthors, Penguin \u00a32.50.\nThis book (according to the blurb) was a bestseller in Poland until December last year,\nwhen Solidarity was suppressed during the\nmilitary takeover. The first six chapters are\nessays and recollections about Walesa by\njournalists and professors and the like. None\nof them are very interesting to read and several of the authors write like windbags. The\nbest of the first seven chapters is one by Jerzy\nKolodziejski who was Governor of Gdansk\nProvince( according to the \" Notes on Contributors\" on page 11) from 1979 until his\ndismissal by the military government early this\nyear. He was the negotiator on the Government side during the strikes in Gdansk shipyard in August 1980, which gives him an\nunusual point of view for describing Walesa.\nHis chapter called \" He is Most Certainly a Tribune of the People\", is very sympathetic to\nSolidarity and it's better written than the other\nessays. Although Kolodziejski is a professor at\na technical university he isn't afraid to say that\n\" People are a bit fed up with all those\nprofessors, clever men who take the country\nfrom one crisis to another\". It's a good sign\nthat someone like him could reach high office\nin Poland. There's also a good sign in another\nof the accounts: \"....Walesa's wife Danuta\nwent....to have her hair done. While she was\nthere she heard from one of the two customers\npresent that 'a fellow (Walesa) has moved in\n(nearby) who visited the Primate-Radio Free\nEurope broadcast in....they have given him a whole floor luxuriously appointed.'\" This\npassage is more revealing than entire chapters\nelsewhere in the book because it shows that\n(a) Polish housewives are prosperous enough\nto be able to have their hair done and (b) they're unafraid to say in the presence of\nstrangers that they listen to Western radio\nstations (at least they were before the military\ntakeover). (And it also reveals that Walesa\naccepted the authorities' offer of a large new\nflat after he became Solidarity's leader.)\nThe eighth chapter is a compilation of letters\nsent to Walesa by people from all over Poland,\nthey're mostly fan mail. Chapter 9 consists of\nextracts from recollections sent in by people in\nresponse10 an appeal from the Polish Sociological Association. Their tone is much\nthe same as the letters and they're repetitive.\nChapter10 is an interview with another\nwindbag, Andrzej W ajda, director of the\nboring films Man of Marble and Man of Iron.\nThe last chapter is the transcription of an\ninterview with Lech Walesa, and it's by a long\nway the best part of the book. The interviewers ( Mar zena and Tadeusz Wozniak) asked deliberately provoking questions and\nthe replies from Walesa are fascinating. For\nexample:\".... you see yourself as sincere, honest and frank, do you?\" \"That's right.\"\nFELIX, March 12, 1982 .\n\"Would you say that those were desirable\nqualities in the field of politics?\" \"What I meant\nwas....look, obviously you can't say everything\nthere is to say. And even though I can and do\nanswer every question put to me, I can't be\nexpected to reveal every single detail.\" \"So\nyou are a tactician \"\nThe contrast between Walesa's straight\nforward e ness and the oiliness of politicians\n(such as student union leaders) is marvellous,\nand this chapter makes the pages and pages of\npraise for Wales a elsewhere in the book almost superfluous. He makes some interesting suggestions too: \"Before we go ahead\n(with a strike), we (should) have talks with\npensioners and orphanages and find out how\nmany cars they need. And then, all the cars\nthat are manufactured during the strike are\nhanded over to people free of charge....we\ndon't give the government anything.\" Again:\n\"Things can't go on the way they are at\npresent with railway men getting free travel and\nme not getting it because I don't work on the\nrailways. Miners dig the coal, so they'll get an\nextra ton of coal each\u2014what's socialist about\nthat?\" (Imagine how Mrs Thatcher would re ac! to the first suggestion, or Arthur Scargill to th t second.)\nIn spite of the boring passages this is a good\nbook and it would be well worth buying if it\nwasn't for the high price. The book is\nadvertised as a \"special rush publication\" and\nit does seem that Penguin are cynically trying\nto cash in on the Polish crisis.\nN. Willson\nPage 10\ni "

The Search for Handbook Articles continues..\nThe deadline for articles for the 1C UNION HANDBOOK is\nFriday April 30. This is the first Friday of Summer Term, clubs and\nsocieties are advised to appoint someone to write their article now\nas any received after this date will not be included.\nArticles printed (or typed) on one side of the paper to the FELIX Office as soon as possible please.\nPeter A Rodgers\nScout & Guide\nWell, we did it. Forty-two miles of pure masochism across the north York\nmoors. Friday saw the start of a very special S&G weekend. Our aim was\nto complete an east to west crossing of the Lyke Wake Walk, starting\nfrom the radio mast at Ravenscar. We arrived at two in the morning and\nafter an initial cup of coffee we set off into the night.\nBy the time we reached the first checkpoint, the blisters had begun to take their toll, Austin needing the biggest repair job. As we walked on, the\ndawn broke over the impressive Fylingdales \"golf balls\" and the light\nhelped us pick our way through the heather to the next but ty stop.\nThen came the bogs. Bog techniques vary, from skipping (Vicky) to swimming (Jenny) but everyone made it to the breakfast stop, although\nthe party had now split up somewhat. Eight miles of \"gra un ch\" along a disused railway line followed, dropping down onto the last but ty stop.\nAndy dropped out, but then had his mind changed by our hero backup support team, Malcolm. The last stage gave everyone an opportunity\nfor a good \" wing e\" as we staggered the last ten miles back to Osmotherley.\nHaving arrived at the hut, we discovered to our dismay that there were steps up to the sleeping room! The next day was spent falling asleep in the pub and, due to our various aches and pains, doing the \" Ly ke Wake\nSilly Walk\".\nSF Soc\nNot a happy bulletin this week I'm afraid. It is with regret that I inform\nyou of the death of two science\nfiction writers. You may have\nheard that Edmund Cooper died\nbecause he used to review books\nfor The Times and they therefore\nacknowledge his existence. What\nyou may not know is that Philip K. Dick died earlier this month. Anyone with any knowledge of the\nSF field must admit that he was\none of the \"greats\" with a list of\nbooks of high quality as long as\nyour arm. Fortunately, his command of English was better than\nmine. Alas, you'll be lucky if you\nsee any obituaries anywhere except in the specialist publica-t ions. Space does not permit me\nto give him his due.\nComplete change of subject.\nOn Tuesday we show Night of the\nLepus in Mech Eng 220, 6:30pm, etc., etc. This is a special Easter\npresentation as this film involves a stampede of giant killer rabbits.\nParagraphs contrasting more than\nthese are hard to find.\nICCAG\nWe have now moved to the Rag\nCommittee Room which is opposite the lift on the top floor of the\nUnion. Meetings as usual, Monday\n12:30.\nLast week we had David Hunter\nfrom Task Force to talk to us. He described the projects they are\ninvolved in with old people. They\ncan arrange for a young person to'\nvisit a pensioner on a regular\nbasis. They also arrange trips for\nthe pensioners which require energetic young helpers. Interested? If so, get in touch.\nWe have our own links with old\npeople: visiting them at St. Pancras Hospital or at a hone on\nHigh Street Kensington.\nSoup Runs as usual on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nWe need helpers to build an\nadventure playground on Wednesday afternoons in Acton for\nthe handicapped children we help\nwith on Saturday afternoons. Come forward all you budding\nengineers and put it in practice!\nSee you soon!\nAstrosoc\nThis Tuesday, March23, at\n6:30pm in Physics LT2, Astrosoc\nis proud to welcome Dr Chris\nIsham from the Theoretical Physics Group. The subject of his\nlecture will be \"Quantum Gravity\",\ndiscussing the problems involved\nin reconciling classical and relativistic gravitational theories\nwith the modern quantum mechanical view of the other physical\nforces, especially as we delve\ndeeper into the heart of the atom\nand distances as small as 10\"3 3\ncm\nhave to be considered. This promises to be a very interesting\nand intriguing lecture to which\neveryone is welcome. There will\neven be coffee and biscuits afterwards for those with the\nstrength of will to resist the call of\nDr Who.\nNot to be outdone by any other\nclub or society, on the following\nThursday, at 1:00pm in Physics\nLT2, we will be holding our AGM, with all the usual annual reports\nand elections for next year's committee. The papers will be up\nuntil Wednesday, so if you want to\nstand for any post (and you are an\nAstrosoc member!), drag yourself,\na proposer and two second ers over to the Union Entrance Hall\nand sign your life away.

    "content": "Elections\nThose who haven't just fell into a gibbering\nheap at the mention of the word may be\ninterested in a few comments on the sabbatical\nelections.\nFirstly, any suggestion that the Presidential\nelection should be re-run is nonsense. Steve\nGoulder was constitutionally elected. I feel that\nif the advice given in FELIX affected any of the\nelections adversely, then it was the DP and\nHon Sec elections where twice as many people\nabstained as in the Presidential election. Thus\nif any elections should be re-run for this reason\nthen it is these two. However, I don't think that\nmy advice made that much difference, although I admit that I made a mistake by\nsaying that an election could be re-run if\nnobody passes quota due to abstentions. This\nis wrong for several reasons, primarily because\nit would severely disadvantage any election\nwhere three or more good candidates stood.\nBut the real reason that the Presidential\nelection was messed up is easier to find. Bob\nHolding succeeded in making the whole thing a farce. He carried out a rabid anti-Goulder\ncampaign which culminated in a weighted\nU GM which decided not to ratify Steve\nGoulder purely because he won, rather than\nfor any other reason. The irony is that if Bob\nHolding had not stood at all, then the result\nWhat's On\nFriday, March 19\n\u2022Anti-Apartheid Picket of IC Board of Governors\nmeeting, 10:15, outside 170 Queensgate.\n\u2022IC Angling Club, 12:30pm, Southside Upper Lounge.\n\u2022 BUN AC meeting, 12:30pm, Green Committee Rm.\n\u2022Socialist Society Bookstall, 12.30-2:30pm, JCR.\nBooks and Campaign Coffee for sale.\n\u2022Soup Run, 10:30pm, Falmouth Kitchen.\nSaturday, March 20\n\u2022West Londoi Chaplaincy Planning Conference, all\nday, Westfield College.

    "content": "Concrete Results\nFollowing IC's impressive performance in the concrete\ncanoe races Mike Rowley followed up, under the UROP\nprogramme, by using a concrete laminate to make a radio-controlled model speedboat. Powered by a3.5cc engine its\nperformance drew an appreciative audience at the Round\nPond. Mike's real work was a thorough going investigation\nof new cement laminates using different textiles as the\nreinforcing material, including mosquito net and an IC hand\ntowel (Domestic Section please note!). The results suggested that textile-reinforced concrete laminates could well\nreplace asbestos tiles in the future. Incidentally the work\nwas sponsored by Marathon Oil and Mike is probably going\nto work for them after graduating.\n'Oh that this too,\ntoo solid state\nwould melt'\nDr S. Angus, Director of the Thermodynamic Tables\nProject Centre in the Chemical Engineering Department,\ntook on geologist G. Tsikos as a UROP student. Dr Angus\nwrites:\nIn the course of its work on the properties of fluids, the\nProject Centre from time to time encounters minor problems of interest which it is unable to pursue and for Mr\nTsikos we had available a problem on the boundary of our\nrespective interests, namely the equation of the melting/\nfreezing curve. We had a considerable quantity of experimental data from many sources in computer readable form\nand suitable programs for manipulating them, including\nleast-squares fitting procedures, etc. and we asked Mr\nTsikos to write short linking programs to investigate how\nwell these data represented various suggested equations and\nto consider possible extensions of them.\nWe warned Mr Tsikos that only negative results were to be\nexpected and this proved to be the case, but the exercise\nwas useful to us in closing several blind alleys, and Mr\nTsikos was pleased to be working on a topic where the\nanswer was not to be found in a textbook, but depended on\nhis own efforts.\nCancer Research\nMark Exley, now in third year Biochemistry, joined Dr\nLane in the Cancer Research Campaign group in the depart-ment. Dr Lane is working on the tumour-producing virus\nSU40. This is a small circular DNA molecule coding for 5\nor 6 proteins, one of which, large T antigen (T), is necessary\nand sufficient for the transformation of mammalian tissue\nculture cells (akin to tumour producing in the animal).\nHis laboratory uses an immuno lo chemical approach to\nstudy Tantigen and its effect on host protein and DNA\nusing mono cl on al antibodies. Mark was engaged in the use\nof these reagents from initial purification to their use in\nradio immuno as says, radio immuno precipitation and in situ\ncharacter is ation of their antigens by cell staining with\nimmunological sandwiches. We became particularly interested in 68K \u2014 a host protein which had provisionally\nbeen shown also to bind an anti-T antigen mono cl on al. His work also involved mammalian tissue culturing, running\npolya cry l amide gels of cell extracts, auto radio graph y, cent ri fuga tion, column 'bead' chromatography (including\naffinity chromatography) and other purification tech-ni ques. He was able to work with the members of his\nlaboratory, particularly whilst learning the techniques.\nSubsequently Dr Lane has obtained semi-pure preparations\nof 68K and much further information on its role in the cell\nis being obtained and will probably be published soon.\nA word for our sponsors\nTo show their enthusiasm for, and faith in, UROP the following firms provided funds to support UROP students continuing\ntheir research during the Summer vacation.\nW.S.

    "content": "Letters\nContinued from page 2.\ne sting to speculate how Marco Led wold considers\nhimself such an expert on the\nConstitution so as to declare\n(in true democratic spirit)\nU GM votes null and void,\nhaving acted un constitutionally himself in the same\nweek. But no, he's throwing\nthe book at us, demonstrating\nwhat a parasitic body the\nUnion Officers have become.\nIt is obvious to anyone\npresent at the meeting that\nthe issue at hand was the lad that Stephen Gould er was\nshort of the quota required for\nhis election. Clearly, since the\nantipathy towards Stephen\nGoulder is so big that the\nstudent body chose to dismiss\nthe whole procedure, rather\nthan ratify his election, he\nought to resign himself and\nstand for re-election. If he\nchooses to abide by the wishes\nof IC students, then I'm sure\nnext time he will not be short\nof a quota.\nI do sincerely hope that a re-election will take place and\nthat someone brings up a motion lor a constitutional\nchange that calls for a mand a tory reelection if no\ncandidate reaches quota. Anything else is a mockery of\ndemocratic practice. And I also hope that someone puts a censure motion on the table in\nthe next U GM. Marco ought\nto be reminded who the real\nboss is in the Union.\nJohn Malathronas\nDear Mark\nI hope you will allow me\nthe space to pass a few-comments on Mr N. Willson\"\nSoapbox\" The Arts and Sciences and Technology\"\"\nand his review of vol unu three of George Or well's Collected Essays in last week's FELIX. That Mr Willson knows\nlittle about what he loosely,\nterms the arts is quite apparent from both pieces. In his\nOrwell review he suggests\nthat \" From the point of view\nof getting recognition from\nthe literary establishment,\nbeing boring is probably an\nadvantage for a writer\" and\ncites authors such as Dickens,\nKafka and Solzhenitsyn as\nevidence for his contention.\nLeaving aside Mr Willson's allusion to the literary esta-blis h ment, since he does not\nspecify what he means by this,\nany lw dy who can find Solzhenitsyn's Russian writings\nboring (and rem eml x r they\nwere written at great personal\nrisk to himself) is lacking in\nliterary appreciation.\nTurning now to his Soapbox article. His first claim\nthat polytechnics were Ibunded as not to have too much\nscience and technology in\nuniversities is quite simply\nwrong. The point of the\npolytechnics was (whether it\nis now, is open lor discussion)\nto provide vocational education. That is to educate people specifically for the\ncareers they would pursue in\nlater file. Thus not only does\ntechnology figure prominently\nin the polytechnics, but also\nsuch vocational subjects as\nlanguages, law, architecture,\nsocial sciences, etc. Now the\nobject of a university is to be\nstrictly non-vocational in that\nit provides an education by\nwhich individuals may attain\nthe widest possible career\nchoice. In other words university education is there to\neducate the mind. Now this is\nthe theory ol\" tertiary education in this country and in\norder to understand why the\nsystem is as it is, it is necessary\nto appreciate what it was\ndesigned to achieve. Thus the\ndisciplinary distinctions which Mr Willson draws are\nsimply not valid. I would very\nmuch like him to name a university in this country which does not have a science\nfaculty. Whereas there is at\nleast one university (Brunei)\nwhich does not have any students majoring in arts\nsubjects.\nI shall ignore with due\ncontempt Mr Willson's remarks on the amount of work\nthat arts students do in comparison with science students (i.e. very little in his\nopinion) and pass on to what I think is the most serious\naspect of Mr Willson's article.\nThis is that he himself makes\na crucial distinction between\nscience and the arts. He assumes that arts an- more\n\"pleasant\" (his word) than\nscience. That is in some way\nhe is accepting the idea of the\nintellectual superiority of the\nartist over the scientist. This is\nnonsense. He assumes that\nserious artists concentrate on\nbroad issues such as the\n\"significance of the Russian\nrevolution\" while the scientists have to concentrate on\nthe minutiae of the \"thermo-stat\". This is again nonsense\nas Mr Willson would realise if\nhe took the trouble to discover\nwhat he is talking about.\nMost artists are also concerned with the minutiae of\ntheir subject such as the role\nof the railways during the\nRussian revolution in Central\nAsia. On the other hand scientists deal with broad\nissues such as the origin of the\nuniverse. The point is that the\nsort of generalisations that Mr Willson made are not only\nwrong they are also dangerous.\nThey perpetuate the myths\nthat each discipline has of the\nother so that destructive people like Mr Willson can\nendeavour to cast a slur on\nthose people who are more\ninterest in other things than\nthey are in science or techno-logy.\nOne reason why Mr Willson\nhas a low opinion of the arts\ncompared to the sciences is\nthat he thinks that the latter\nare \" useful'' and have a \"utilitarian\" value, both of\nwhich qualities he thinks artists despise. I quote \"Artists\ncan only preserve their work\nbecause (his emphasis) someone\nelse is learning about soil\nmechanics\". What does Mr Will son mean by this? In\nwhat logical sense is the word\nbecause used? I would suspect\nthat Mr Will son means, although it is not at all clear,\nthat scientists and engineers\nand soil mechanician s, help\nprovide the wealth of the\ncountry which he thinks goes\nto support artists. lit is is a simplistic argument since it\nignores the fact that artists\nfirst of all produce things\u2014\nbooks, paintings, etc.\u2014and\nsecondly they help consume\nthe products of the economy;\nconsumers are as important to\nthe economy as producers, a lad which Mr VVillson appears\nnot to have grasped. So where\nare we left with the word\nuseful. It is simply a word\nwhich Mr Willson defines in\nsuch a way as to justify his\nbigot ted attitudes. In other\nwords he is attempting to\ndeny the freedom of the\nindividual to study what they\nwish to study; Orwell rules!\nMr Willson also has a very\npeculiar attitude towards science in that he thinks that\nthe content of science is fixed\nin a way that art is not. He is\ntight in the latter, but wrong\nin the former. He should know, but appears not to\nknow, that the content of\nscience changes and that this\nis the purpose of research.\nEven where the content of\nscience is acknowledged it\nmay be subject to different\ninterpretations. For example\nin the recent discussion of\nDarwinian natural selection\nwhich was conducted in these\npages I argued for a strictly\nmaterialistic interpretation of\nthe nature of life while others,\nin my opinion mistaking ly, argued lor a die stic inter-preta tion. In conclusion I would suggest that Mr Willson does\nnot know what he is talking\nabout and should follow\nWittenstein's dictum \"whereof\none cannot speak, thereof one\nshould remain silent\".\n} burs sincerely\nFrank James\nDear Mark\nIn last week's Soapbox, N. Will son in forms us that\".... most people interested in\nthe arts are pratt s; they're\nusually pretentious, arrogant\nand self-important.\"\nNow, passionately interested artist though he obviously is, he has totally failed\nto make use of the basis of\narts, i.e. communication of\nideas; his otherwise excellent\narticle* does not tell us\nanything we didn't know already. However, if he would\nlet me know what he is trying\nto say, I( as a pretentious but\nliterate scientist) would be\ndelighted to put his thoughts\nin to an article for inclusion in\nnext week's Small Ads column.\n\"i burs arrogantly\nAdrian Janus\n*Indicates sarcasm\nNB: Not all pretentious\npoliticians are artists \u2014 our\nmost notorious one has a degree in biochemistry to her\nname.

This meant that the mascots\ncould not be present at y ester day's Guilds Union Meeting. Why I over-ruled\na UGM Decision\nThe Results U GM decision to re-run the sabbatical elections was ultra\nvire s the constitution because the objections made were not on\nconstitutional grounds. There are various reasons why an election can\nbe re-run and the only one that could have been brought up at the\nResults U GM was that I, as Returning Officer, had run the elections\nun constitutionally. There were two main objections raised at the U GM. The first was\nthat people had been misled into thinking that candidates had to pass\nquota before they were deemed to be elected. The only place from\nwhere students could have gained this misconception was in Mark Smith's editorial in the Manifesto Supplement in FELIX issue number\n608. An editorial by definition is the personal opinion of the writer and\npeople should treat it as such and not accept it unquestioningly.\nMark Smith did not deliberately mislead people and did not bias his\nadvice towards any one candidate. It is not even certain that his\nadvice played any major role.\nThe second objection concerned a written undertaking which all the\ncandidates signed immediately prior to the count. This stated that\ncandidates had to pass quota before they could be deemed to be\nelected. On consultation with the Electoral Reforms Society (experts\non proportional representation systems) and on closer examination of\nthe Union Constitution this was not found to be so. Had I acted in\naccordance with this undertaking I would have been acting un constitutionally. Any suggestions that this undertaking in ll u en ced the outcome of the\nelections are ridiculous since it was not made until after votes had been\ncast.\nElections Committee are empowered to ratify the sabbatical\nelections and this was done before the results were announced at the\nUG M.AU GM can only object to that ratification on the grounds of\nunconstitutional election procedure. No objections were raised on these\ngrounds. The fact that the only objections raised were against the\nratification of the presidential election indicates that people were\nobjecting to the results and not the procedure. Obviously there were\npeople who voted for the other presidential candidates but Stephen\nGoulder was constitutionally elected and these people should accept\nthe result.\nMarco Ledwold\nReturning Officer\nA look at the figures\nNot surprisingly, many students are still confused about the results of\nthe sabbatical elections. The actual voting figures are shown in full\nbelow. Figures in brackets are percentages of total Union membership.\nPresident\nGoulder\nLyall\nHolding\nTaylor\nStage\n364\n320\n335\n288\nStage 2\n446\n400\n376\nStage 3\n519\n478\nStage 4\n728\nTotal valid votes: 1307 (28.57%) Quota654 Abstentions 156 (3.41%)\nSpoilt papers: 25\nGoulder is elected at stage 3 (rule 9.2(b) of the Voting Schedule),\nbut would in any case have exceeded quota after Lyall's votes were\nre-allocated.\nDeputy President\nStage 1\nGreenstreet 838\nWhite 172\nLivett 116\nTotal valid votes: 1126 (24.62%) Quota564 Abstentions 304 (6.65%)\nSpoilt Papers: 49\nGreentstreet passes quota at Stage 1 and is elected.\nHonorary Secretary\nStage 1\nFreeman 606\nMorgan273 Cryer 239\nTotal valid votes: 1,118 (24.4%) Quota560 Abstentions: 317 (0.93%)\nSpoilt papers: 36\nFYeeman passes quota at Stage 1 and is elected.\nAll quotas are calculated in accordance with rule 4 of the Voting Schedule (i.e. abstentions are not counted) and are not those org in ally given by the Returning Officer.\nThe interesting question is how the voting was affected by the\nmisleading advice given by FELIX to abstain in order to have the\nelection rerun. Clearly, if all the people who abstained had spoilt their\nballot papers, the elections for both Deputy President and Hon Sec\nwould have been in quo rate( i.e. less than 25% of Union members having cast a valid vote or an abstention). The presidential election, however\nwould still be quo rate with 28.57% voting.\nJon Stanley\nFELIX, March 19, 1982 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "There is a very large branch of puzzles which\nup to now has been totally ignored in this\ncolumn, which is a great pity since it includes\nmany of my favourites. Iam referring to\nmanipulative puzzles, the type where you have\nto remove a string from a wire shape, or slide a wooden bead along a cord, or dismantle and\nreassemble a set of wooden blocks. For obvious reasons it is quite difficult for me to set\na puzzle of this type as a prize puzzle, but a few weeks ago someone showed me an idea\nwhich enables me to set a manipulative puzzle\nusing nothing more than a rectangular sheet of\npaper.\n1. Obtain from somewhere an ordinary\nsheet of paper. The size and quality are\nunimportant, but it must be rectangular. If you\nare reading this at 9:30 on Friday morning, you\ncould while away a boring lecture (and annoy\nthe lecturer) by using a sheet from your\nnotepad. Or you could try the puzzle in any\nother situation where there is a plentiful supply\nof rectangular sheets of paper. Anyhow, take\nthe sheet, fold it in half, score the crease\nheavily, and unfold again.\n2. Fold it in half the other way, then in half\nagain. Once more score the creases heavily,\nand open the sheet out flat. Four creases\nshould now divide the paper into eight\ncongruent rectangles.\n3. Number the rectangles as shown in the\nfigure.\n1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8\nEaster\nA reminder of the benefits which some\nstudents may be entitled to apply for this\nEaster vacation, especially those paying rent.\nFor a more detailed description call in at\nStudent Services, 15 Princes Gardens for our\nhandout sheet and individual advice if\nrequired.\nUnemployment Benefit\nThis can be claimed if you are available for\nwork during the vacation and have earned at\nleast \u00a31,350 between April 1980 to April 1981,\nor \u00a3975 between April 1979 to April 1980.\nAnyone who qualifies will receive \u00a325pw provided they 'sign on' the first week day of the\nvacation and when required thereafter.\nSupplementary Benefit\nAny student who pays rent over the vacation\nand can 'sign on' at the DHS S office in the area\n4. Turn the paper over, and number the\nreverse of the rectangles so that each has the\nsame number on both sides.\n5. Without tearing the paper, fold it along the\ncreases so that the rectangles lie on top of each\nother in the order 1 5 6 4 8 7 3 2.\n6. Send the thing to me at the FELIX Office,\ntogether with comments and criticisms.\n\u00a35 (donated by Mend-a Bike) for the correct\nsolution randomly selected at 1:00pm next\nWednesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nEight is the smallest number of triangles (see\ndiagram). Andrew Powell, Physics 2, was the\nonly person to find this.\nPrevious Week's Solution\nThe problem, you will recall, was to find which\nof twelve coins was of different weight from the\nothers using three weighing s to be determined\nBenefits\nwhere the accommodation is, should be able\nto claim part or all of their rent back since this\nexpenditure is not allowed for in the vacation\nelement of the grant and effectively reduces a student's income to below subsistence level\nduring this period. It is important to go to the\nJob Centre early on the first day of the\nvacation in order to get the full entitlement.\nRent Allowances and Rate Rebates\nIf you are paying rent and will be going home\nfor the whole of the Easter vacation this may\nbe the only benefit available to you. It can be\napplied for at any time from the Town Hall for\nthe area where you are paying rent. Normally\nthey will assess you on the basis of your\nterm time income (\u00a354pw) and it will be up to\nyou to contact them after the vacation to reassess it on your income for that period\n(\u00a321.50).\nFELIX, March 19, 1982\nbefore the results of any of the weighing s are\nknown. I am grateful to Andy Strangeways for\nthe following mnemonic for the solution. Letter\nthe coins with the letters of the phrase FAM NOT LICKED. Then the phrase MA DO LIKE ME TO FIND FAKE COIN tells you to weigh\nMA DO against LIKE, ME TO against FIND and FAKE against COIN. These weighing s will\nalways determine the fake.\n...And The Week Before...\nThis caused so much confusion that I shall give\nboth the right way and the wrong way to do it.\nFirst, the wrong way. From Amble's last\nstatement, we get BA2C D is greater\nthan or equal to zero. We know A. B.C.D equals 270 (=2.3.3.3.5) and since A is the\nsmallest of the four, A is 2 or 3. The case A=3 is\neasily eliminated, leaving A=2,C=D=3 and\nB=15. The right way takes into account the fact\nthat 1 is also a factor of 270. Amble told the\nCaptain that everyone who attended the\ndisplay visited just one of the four stalls, from\nwhich the Captain could deduce that A+B+C+ D=K for some value K which he\nknows (but we don't). And this was not\nenough for the Captain to work out the values\nof A,B,C, and D. So K has a value which\nmakes the simultaneous equations\nA+B+C+ D=KA. B.C.D=270 have more than one solution. There are four\nsuch values:\n1+1+15+18 = 35 = 1+2+5+27\n1+2+9+15 = 27 = 1+3+5+18\n1+3+9+10 = 23 = 2+3+3+15\n2+3+5+9 = 19 = 3+3+3+10\nAmble's additional information enables the\nCaptain to work out the correct numbers as 2,\n3, 3, and 15.\n...And Ages Ago\nFinally, there were several misprints in Zar\nAmrolia's solution to the piano moving puzzle\nin the Christmas FELIX. The correct solution\ngoes: U U, left tim pU, other tim pR, DLL, tim pU one unit, RD R(UL) UL(L D)DR RU ULL D( DR) RR DLL U URD RUL U( RU)\nL DDR DL( UL) U UR( RD) D( DR) RUL D,D one unit, L, music stands U, music stands U,R, lower tim pD, grand piano R,D LL LL URD DR U( LU) ULL DR RU( UL) L. When claiming SB and R&R rebates the\nfollowing information will normally be needed:\nproof of rent payable (letters can be obtained\nfrom Student Services for those in the Head\nTenancies), copy of grant allocation, recent\nbank statement, plus any documents relating\nto other income or investments. If heating and\nhot water is included in your rent this reduces\nthe amount eligible for a refund by about \u00a36pw, unless you can get some form of documentary\nevidence that it is less (we can provide this for\nclaimants living in Halls and Houses).\nDental charges go up again on April 1, so it\nmight be worth getting an appointment in\nbefore that date if you are over 19. However,\nduring the vacation it should be possible for\nmost students to get a refund, while those on\nSupplementary Benefit are automatically\nexempt (ask for the exemption certificate\nwhile you're at the DHS S office). If you have a rent commit te ment of around \u00a325pw it may\nalso be possible to claim back charges during\nterm time.
