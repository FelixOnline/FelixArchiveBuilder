Pinkie\nmay be out of action on the\npitch, but on the true battlefield (the Union dance floor)\nshe continues to score!\nOh God, I might have to\nmention the match now. Do\nI have to?\nWell, the Virgins started\nbadly when only 11 players\nturned up, but after a quick\ntrip to a sports shop on the\nway, re-arrangement of boots\nand borrowing of kit (boots,\nsocks, shorts...) from coach\nDave, there was a team of 12.\nAfter the fuss of arranging\nthis friendly, we were damn\nwell playing a rugby match,\nso Brunel very generously\nlent us three of their players.\nAfter a very hasty discussion,\nwe put their flanker at fly\nhalf and our winger (me!) at\nscrum half and started the\nmatch.\nHighlights included forward of the match Hayley sitting on their prop\u2019s face and\nbeing surprised as \u201cmost people like it\u201d. This was clearly\nunacceptable. But the prop\nwas obviously listening, as\nshe went on to sit on Beater\ntwice. Newbie Tumbles (back\nof the match) played a stellar game and put Nathan\u2019s\ntackling advice to very good\nuse, mullering many a wayward Brunel player. Beater\nbonded with Dapps about\ntheir common Welsh-Belgian\nsexiness and commendably held up the second row.\nPip exhibited the totally\nmad-for-it attitude that\nmade her an awesome prop.\nAli put in far too many\nfantastic tackles to be put\non the wing and had to be\nmoved into the centre.\nThe same can be said for\nDanger Mouse who showed\nher try-hungry colours by yelling for the ball all the time.\nSo in the end, as you can tell,\nthe Virgins were all utterly\nstupendous but Brunel somehow managed to win (they\nare in the league above).\nMany thanks must go to\nour guest coaches on Monday,\nJen for coming and watching\nin the wet and cold and to our\nsuper duper driver and water\nmonkey Ed, who must now be\nquestioning his wisdom dating a Virgin after standing in\nthe pouring rain all afternoon\nand enduring the chorus that\nechoed round Southside and\nthe Union Bar: \u201cHail to the\nbus driver!\u201d\nIf you are interested in playing women\u2019s rugby, getting\nfit, making friends and singing loudly after a few pints,\nwe would love to hear from\nyou. No previous experience\nis necessary, and all shapes\nand sizes can play. Please\ncontact captain Kitty on\ncatherine.fitzgerald@ic.ac.uk.\nRUGBY\nStupendous Virgins somehow\nlose friendly match\nTwo tries for\nHiggins secure\nwinning start\nSponsored by\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 24\nChichester Men\u2019s 1st 16\nBy Mike Hicks\nThe First XV started their\nfirst match of the season with\na team almost unchanged\nfrom last year. Having not\nlost at Harlington for the\nprevious two seasons, we\ncame out strong if not a little rusty.\nShortly after kick-off, a\ncareless penalty close to\nour 22 gave Chichester the\nchance to open the scoring\nwith a penalty. Being three\npoints down woke up the\nImperial team and we started\nplaying some good rugby.\nA great break by O\u2019Rourke\non the halfway line was followed by even better support\nand finished up with a four\non one against the fullback.\nRobinson duly touched down\nto open the Imperial scoring.\nShortly after the restart, a\nbit too much French flair led\nto Spencer throwing a horrendous miss pass in front of\nthe IC posts. The opposition\ncentre had seen this coming from about last week and\nintercepted to score under\nthe posts and make it 10-5 to\nthe visitors.\nChichester were now back\nin the match but Imperial\nraised their game again and\nSpencer went in for a try\nin the corner to level the\nscores.\nIn the second half we\nstarted to play a bit more\nconsistently, but more\nunnecessary penalties gave\nChichester the chance to\nscore another six points.\nLuckily, Higgins had other\nideas and with a man of the\nmatch, hat-trick avoiding, full\nback trampling performance,\nhe scored two tries to secure\nthis season\u2019s first league\nwin for the Imperial College\nUnion Rugby Club.\nNotable performances\ncame from debut freshers\nSimon and Luke and also\nfrom O\u2019Rourke with some\nsuperb strength on the wing.\nAlthough Wednesday\u2019s\nperformance was scrappy\nat times, if we continue to\nimprove and cut out the penalties and dodgy miss passes\nthen this year should be\nanother very successful season for Imperial rugby.\nRUGBY\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 69\nQueen Mary 0\nBy Mike Hicks\nThe Third XV, Imperial\u2019s most\nsociable rugby team, started\ntheir season with a crushing\nvictory.\nFrom the start of the game,\nthe opposition defence was\nalmost non-existent and\nthere were gaps all over the\npitch. This meant the powerful Imperial attack was virtually unchallenged as they ran\nin try after try.\nBoosted by a powerful\nbench of over 40 freshers\nto choose from, the Thirds\ndominated from start to fin-ish. Man of the match went to\ncaptain Dan \u201cPeanut Head\u201d\nLindsley for his leadership\nand also a sublime left-footed\ndrop goal from the halfway\nline!\nHopefully next week\u2019s\nopposition will provide more\nof a challenge to the powerful force that is the Imperial\nThird team.\nMedicals triumph\nover Imperial\nSeconds\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 17\nImperial Medicals\nMen\u2019s 2nd 23\nBy Mike Hicks\nFor the first match of the sea-son, Imperial\u2019s Second XV\nrolled into Harlington to face\nthe newly promoted Medics,\nwith LSE seconds having quit\nthe league at the last minute!\nWith a healthy contingent\nof old and new players alike,\nImperial faced up to the medics knowing that it would be a\nhard fought match. An early\nscore came from a kicked\nmedic penalty after some\nnervous early play (0-3).\nThe Imperial team came\nstraight back at the medics\nand after some dominating\nscrummaging were rewarded\nwith a penalty inside the\nopposition 22. Two quick forward moves later and Steve\nMcClell crashed over for a\ndebut fresher try (5-3).\nUndeterred, the medics\nquickly applied pressure and\nscored under the posts, giving them an easy conversion\n(5-10). The Newmanator then\nhit back with a devastating\ntry to level the scores (10-10).\nSome lax defending then\ngifted the medics a try out\nwide (10-15). Refusing to\ngive in, the mighty Imperial\nSeconds fought scrum after\nscrum in their own 22, before\nfinallyreleasingAlexNewman\nfor his second try of the game,\ntaking the lead (17-15) with\nthe help of a superb conversion from Tom Hodgson.\nWith five minutes to go, the\nmedics hit back with a try and\na penalty in swift succession,\nleaving the Imperial Seconds\nwith a desperate last play to\ntry to capture an elusive winning try. This was not to be,\nand the match ended 17-23.\nDespite the last minute\nloss, the Imperial seconds\nremain optimistic, eight\nfreshers started the game\nand all acquitted themselves\nwell. The development of the\nside has only just begun, but\na successful season certainly\nbeckons!\nRUGBY\nRUGBY\nThirds\nthrash\nQM\nHeavy lifting: the Rugby Club in line-out action Got him: an Imperial player makes a crunching tackle\n\n"

Making radical\nnew proposals, he suggested\nscrapping the endless public\nexaminations and arduous\nA level system, replacing it\nwith a diploma system that\nallows more leeway for both\nthe more and less academically gifted pupils.\nThe diploma would replace\nall secondary school exams,\nrunning from ages 14 to\n19, and the pupils would be\nallowed to take it at their own\npace. The brightest students\nwould complete A level-style\nexam questions, including some questions closer\nto degree level, and would\ncomplete a long dissertation\naimed at allowing universities more opportunities to\nchoose between students at\nthe admissions stage. In addi-tion, all the grades the pupil\nhad ever achieved would be\navailable to universities, so\nstudents would not be able\nto repeat a module several\ntimes and only report the best\nscore, as is the case now.\nOther students would be\nable to take more vocational\nqualifications, but no-one will\nbe able to graduate with the\ndiploma without reaching\nbasic standards in literacy,\nmaths and information tech-nology. Students will be able\nto choose a number of mod-ules, either a broad range for\nmore able pupils or a series\nthat add up to a complete\ndiploma in, for example, leisure and tourism.\nSome of the more radical\nsuggestions involve including\nstudents\u2019 after-school activi-ties, voluntary work and hobbies in the diploma, and there\nbeing an oral exam to test\nstudents properly and ensure\nall the work is their own.\nThere was widespread\napproval of the plans when\nthey were announced, with\nheadteachers welcoming\nthe changes. Parents were\nalso expected to approve,\nparticularly those worried\nabout over-testing children\n\u2013 the diploma would involve\nno coursework other than the\nextended dissertation.\nHowever, the brief but welcome moment of unity was\nbroken when, confusingly,\nthe Prime Minister gave a\nspeech in which he appeared\nto suggest that the diploma\nwould not replace but rather\n\u2018strengthen\u2019 GCSEs and A\nlevels. Mr Blair and Charles\nClarke, the Education\nSecretary, appeared not to\nwholeheartedly support the\nideas, despite lobbying by\nteaching groups. They may\nhave been worried by reports\nthat business leaders were\nnot convinced that the advantages brought by the new\nsystem would be worth the\ndisruption and difficulty\ncaused by introducing it.\nBusinesses have long complained about the decline\nin literacy and numeracy\nin trainees, and on Monday\nthey suggested that the diploma would not do enough to\nimprove them.\nItmaybethatfurthertweaking of the plans are necessary\nto satisfy all sides, although\nwith a ten-year introduction\ntimetable, there is plenty of\ntime for that.\nConfusion over changes to British exam system\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nA record number of voters\nparticipated in the recent\nelections of Imperial College\nUnion Council members,\nULU delegates, academic\nrepresentatives, Faculty\nUnion officers and members\nof other Union committees.\nHowever, only 15 of the 40\nposts were filled as voters\nexpressed their dissatisfaction with the candidates\nby choosing to \u2018Re-Open\nNominations\u2019 (RON).\nThe results were due to\nbe announced at Monday\u2019s\nmeeting of Union Council.\nHowever, the counting software in use was only designed\nto count 1000 votes, and there\nwere 1093. Consequently, the\nmeeting was delayed for 40\nminutes as staff, who had\nalready been counting the\nvotes by hand throughout the\nday, tried to complete this\narduous task.\n16 people were to be elected to Union Council, but only\nOmar Abbara, Lucy Abbott,\nHenry Chan, Amanda Clarke\nand Morten Olesen finished\nahead of RON, so there will\nbe a new election for the\nremaining 11 places.\nDaniel O\u2019Connell, Tom\nTibbits and Henry Chan were\nelected to the Trading and\nRetail Committee, with RON\nin fourth place, leaving one\nvacancy.\nDaniel Carrivick was\nthe only student elected to\nServices Committee, which\nnow has three vacancies.\nPranati Joshi was the only\none elected to the Student\nDevelopment Committee.\nRON triumphed in the election to House Committee, so\nfour vacancies remain. RON\nwas also victorious in the\nelection for ULU delegates.\nSeveral people suggested\nthat the remaining positions\nshould be filled by electing\nfrom the floor at the meet-ing, \u201cfor the sake of pragmatism\u201d and because they\nbelieved that far fewer people\nwould vote in any new elec-tion. These suggestions were\nrejected, as it was deemed\nunacceptable to have certain\nmembers elected by cross-campus ballot and others chosen by \u201c40 people in a room\u201d.\nThe Union constitution\nstates that new elections to\nthe remaining positions must\nbe held within ten College\ndays of the results being\nannounced. The President\u2019s\ninterpretation of this is that\nnominations must close by\nTuesday 2 November at the\nlatest.\nThis year, for the first\ntime, elections to the posts\nin question took place online\nby cross-campus ballot.\nPreviously, they took place\nat the first Union Council\nmeeting of term, meaning\nthat the only people voting\nwere those present in the\nroom at the time. The new\nsystem has obviously led to a\nhuge increase in turnout, giving those elected a far larger\nmandate than their pred-ecessors. The recent \u2018VOTE\u2019\npublicity campaign appears\nto have been particularly\nsuccessful in persuading students to exercise their democratic right.\nMustafa Arif, Union\nPresident, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a long\ntime since we\u2019ve had a good\nRON turnout. I\u2019m just glad\nthe students are voting.\u201d\nWhen asked whether RON\ncould also win the new elec-tions, he added: \u201cIt obviously\nis a concern, but this is what\ndemocracy is there for. If people don\u2019t have confidence in\nthose standing for election\nand want to vote RON, then\nthat\u2019s what they\u2019re entitled to\ndo. What I hope will happen\nnow is that others will see fit\nto stand who didn\u2019t, and that\nthose who failed to inspire the\nelectorate this time around\nwill try a little harder to campaign for votes.\u201d\n\u25cf Meanwhile, also at the\nImperial College Union\nCouncil meeting on Monday,\nMustafa Arif survived a vote\nof confidence in his presiden-cy. Having offered his resignation last week and then\nchanged his mind the following day, Mr Arif felt it necessary to seek the backing of\nthe Council, which he duly\nreceived.\n\u2018Re-Open Nominations\u2019 proves\nunexpectedly popular as record\nnumbers vote in Union elections\nIt\u2019s back: the elections took place online, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop us from using our\nbeloved ballot box photograph\nExam overhaul: many students will spend less time in\nexamination rooms like this if new proposals are adopted\n\n"

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nEntering the car park of this famous\nclub is an experience in itself. The\ngates are constructed entirely of\ncrushed cars piled on top of each\nother, creating a breathtaking sight\nfor first time visitors. Muffled bass\ncan be heard seeping out of the\nbuilding as you make your way to\nthe entrance, filling you with anticipation and excitement. Be warned\nthough, chewing gum cannot be\ntaken inside due to one of the many\ngash rules now bestowed onto modern clubbers, resulting in bad breath\nfor the duration of the night.\nGodskitchen used to be classed\nas one of the posh superclubs in the\nUK, and in comparison to places\nlike Gatecrasher 1 (formerly The\nRepublic) in Sheffield and Cream at\nNation in Liverpool, it is. However,\ncomparing it now to new clubs\npopping up around the country,\nGodskitchen seems like a bit of a\nhole to be honest. Still, I personally love the place and it does hold a\ntouch of class above the rest.\nUpon entry you have a bar to your\nright and are faced with a series of\nsteps. One leads up to the second\nand third rooms, the other down\nto the main arena. The main room\nis a large warehouse-like expanse,\nwith the DJ booth behind you as you\nenter, raised slightly above the many\nclubbers and podium dancers.\nSeeing Carl Cox\u2019s fat head behind\nthe decks brought a slight smile to\nmy face as he blasted out his own\ndistinct style of techno. You can tell\nhe\u2019s been in the business for years,\nand why he\u2019s one of the best technical DJs in the world.\nOne thing you can always depend\non Coxy delivering is a crowd \u2013 the\nwhole club was packed and literally\nhotter then the sun. This didn\u2019t stop\nthe atmosphere being electric or the\nmasses of clubbers dancing almost\nin unison, giving even first time\nclubbers an overwhelming sense of\nelation. Amazingly, everyone in the\nclub emitted a friendly aura with\neveryone wanting to shake your\nhand and be your part-time mate for\nthe night.\nVenturing upstairs, you find an\n\u2018oxygen bar\u2019, or the \u2018rip-off bar\u2019 as I\nlike to call it. Personally, the thought\nof paying \u00a35 for five minutes of flavoured air is completely dokey, but\nrecommend it to anyone you don\u2019t\nlike and just have the satisfaction of\nwatching them throw their money\ndown the proverbial drain!\nNext to this is the second room,\nwhich houses a completely different type of music. James Zabelia\nwas playing progressive house and\nlater returned to play an awesome\nbreakbeat set. This room is a lot\nsmaller then the main one and you\ncan actually spit in the DJ\u2019s face\nwhile ordering yourself a beer at\nthe bar. Not advised, but worth a try\nfor kicks.\nThe sounds were bassy and\nbouncy with monotonic vocals over\ndeep bass lines and electronic hiccups reverberating round the room.\nZabelia also scratches like a kid with\nnits, adding new dimensions and\nnew sounds to his already breathtaking mixing. An acquired musical\ntaste, but awesome if you appreciate it.\nThe third room at Godskitchen\nis the funky lounge. Situated at the\ntop of the club and hard to find for\nthe first time, the lounge can be\nquite intimidating. Originally it was\nthe chill-out room for wrecked club-bers that needed to get away for a\nbit. Now it has turned into a haven\nfor the \u2018pretty people\u2019 in the club,\nfull of sexy gals and pretty boys,\nwhichever takes your fancy. As you\nwalk in you immediately notice a\nline of them posing along the bar.\nYou know who I mean \u2013 ripped faded\njeans, funky tops and stylish hair.\nFag in one hand, drink in the other\nand armed with a cheeky smile, they\noccasionally break out into a spontaneous shuffle to the music, trying to impress one of the gorgeous\ngirls dotted around the room (the\nthrust and the wink is my personal\nfavourite).\nThe lounge has a plush carpet\nand comfy seats with huge square\ntables, ideal for chilling and chatting.\nFunky beats are blasted out at tolerable levels, so chit chat is possible\nbut you still get the feel of being in\na club. The atmosphere can be pretentious on first impression, but is\nactually friendly. You soon find that\nyou can easily walk up to someone\nand strike up a conversation about\nnothing. Alternatively, you can just\nstrut up and dance with a group of\nknow-yas (randoms) without getting\nlooked at like a complete weirdo.\nIf you\u2019re looking to sit and observe\nsome of the best looking specimens\nof our species, the lounge is an ideal\nplace to do so.\nBasically Godskitchen has a little something for everyone, apart\nfrom R\u2019n\u2019B, but come on, a bit of\nchange will do you guys some good.\nWhether you\u2019re a die-hard clubber\nout for a good time or a pretentious\nposer, this club has something for\nyou. It\u2019s well worth the trip out of\nLondon for something a little bit\ndifferent.\nHass Jishi\nCLUB REVIEW\nBefore I start, I should give you\nan idea of how this article is going\nto pan out. Two weeks ago, Simon\nreviewed Knowwhere and made\nvarious comments about the quality of the music and DJs. To say I\nwas horrified doesn\u2019t do justice to\nthe set of emotions I went through\nas my eyes grew wider and my jaw\nmoved slowly towards the floor, culminating in the spraying of my drink\nacross the table as the shock of two\nstars just threw me over the edge.\nKnowwhere (KW) has been one\nof my favourite events, if not my\nfavourite, since I started going there\nabout 18 months ago, and I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve that everybody else didn\u2019t\nfeel the same. Everyone I know that\nhas been adores the place, and the\nregular, familiar crowd attest to the\nfact that it really does do it for many,\nmany people. Of course, there are\ngoing to be differences in taste, but\nfor me and my friends that\u2019s only\nhalf the story, the other half being\nmade up firmly of the people, atmosphere and overall vibe of the place,\nwhich in my experience are almost\nunparallelled in London. Because\nof this, I decided I had to review\nthe next Knowwhere night, to try\nto convince you all that it\u2019s worth\nevery penny.\nOriginally, KW was held in the\nSoundshaft, a 600 capacity club near\nCharing Cross, and this was part of\nwhat made the event so special. The\nintimacy was astonishing and made\nthe whole thing feel like a glorified private party which, we decided,\nwas \u201cfucking wicked!\u201d\nWhen we heard that KW was moving to the Fridge, we were excited\nbut also cautious. The Fridge is an\nawesome club, but would the atmosphere transfer to a venue with over\ntwice the capacity? The first time\nwe went we couldn\u2019t believe how\nwell the move had gone \u2013 the familiar faces were all still around, but\nso were loads of new ones and the\nfeel of the original KW was still\nthere in spades. The fact that it\nwas their third birthday meant that\nextra effort had been made, with the\nmain room decked out in a suitably\nparty-spirited way. The usual stalls\nwere there by the bar area selling\nT-shirts, CDs and things that glow in\nthe dark, and loads of extra seating\nhad been put in by the entrance. The\nbar area itself was extremely disco\nwith hundreds of small glitter balls\nlittering the low ceiling, glowing red\nand blue through the perspex sur-faces.\nThe opportunities the second\nroom offers have been seized upon,\nand it was full every time I went\nin. This was especially so for the\nback to back set by Shaun Rowland\nand Dom Pardey, whose enthusiasm behind the decks was wonderful to watch, mainly because they\nare regular crack-on buddies and\nso share a rapport rarely seen these\ndays. The set was full of techy, funky\nhouse with masses of groove that\nthe crowd just lapped up like a cat\non the cream.\nAs I was strutting my funky stuff,\nmy friend commented that this was\nthe way clubbing was heading \u2013\ntowards funky, beat driven house,\nsimilar to the kind of material you\ncan find on early Trade CDs \u2013 and I\nwould be inclined to agree. It\u2019s cool,\nenjoyable music to spend an evening\nwith and fantastic for people-watch-ing. However, my heart still belongs\nto trance. It was trance I had come\nfor and it was trance I was going to\nhave.\nOne thing I should make clear at\nthis point: KW do not do cutting edge,\nintelligent, forward-thinking trance.\nThey are not pushing the genre forward into the future; I wouldn\u2019t even\nsay they do the same kind of trance\nGatecrasher used to do. No, what\nKW do better than anybody else\nis bouncy trance that makes you\nwant to jump around like a rabbit\nwith a head full of poppers, grinning\nlike a post-orgasmic Cheshire cat. If\nyou want to stand around all night\npondering the complexities of the\nmix the DJ is in the middle of, or\ndiscussing why Tiesto, Van Dyk and\nArmand are shit and nowhere near\nas good as the Armenian producer\nyou discovered while you were chatting about your new drum sequencer on trancebores.com, then piss off.\nOr more specifically, don\u2019t bother\ncoming here \u2013 you won\u2019t like it.\nKW is for people who want to have\na bit of a laugh, catch up with old\nfriends, make new ones, have a bit\nof a bounce around and leave in the\nmorning smiling and feeling their\nlives are just that little bit better for\nhaving been there. This is achieved\nwith the help of a great bunch of\nDJs and a music policy that suits me\ndown to the ground.\nWhen we rolled up at midnight,\nthe main room was already buzzing\nand Steve Morley was just about\nto step up. Steve was followed by\nLizzie Curious (my first time, and\nI was impressed), Anthony Dean\n(all hail the mini DJ), Pablo (pro-moter/legend), Ian Betts (Imperial\ngraduate/top bloke/awesome DJ)\nand Matt Darey (nuff said).\nFor those who weren\u2019t here last\nyear or missed my incessant ravings in Felix, Ian Betts is absolutely\nmassive in London and one of the\nbest, most loved trance DJs currently doing the rounds. He\u2019s grown\nin stature over the last few years\nhaving played for Cream in Ibiza,\ntoured Australia and been installed\nas Heat\u2019s second ever resident. He\u2019s\non the way right to the top. He\nknows exactly what and when to\ngive to the crowd and he is adored\nfor it. Needless to say, tonight he\nwas excellent and as usual his own\nLove Resurrection blew the roof off.\nThis production has been tearing up\ndance floors across London for over\n18 months and is finally set for a\nrelease in the next few weeks. I urge\nyou to go out and get a copy as soon\nas you can.\nFinishing off the night in style,\nMatt Darey came along with his\ntypical brand of driving, melodic and\nuplifting trance. He was also the\nsource of a few surprises in terms\nof track choices, playing Silence and\nan absolutely epic version of Dreams\nthat seemed to go on forever to give\nthe night a perfect ending.\nThe tune of the night, just edging\nLove Resurrection into second, has\nto be For An Angel. Unbelievably,\nI\u2019d never heard this in a club and it\nsounded amazing. It certainly got\nthe biggest response of the night\nand had every single person standing with their arms in the air and\nheads held back.\nOverall then, another fantastic\nnight out at KW for me. As usual,\nthe people were spot on, the atmosphere was there in bucketloads and\nthe music was perfect. Granted, it\u2019s\nnot for everyone, some may find it\na bit cheesy and simple, but those\npeople would be missing the point\naltogether. After all, it\u2019s about having fun, and I know of nowhere that\nhas an overall package that is as\nmuch fun as Knowwhere. Do yourself a favour next month, and get a\nbit of trance in your life.\nDom Farrell\nGo Knowwhere, fast!\nYou might remember a not-so-positive review of this place from two weeks ago.

    "content": "Music music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 21 October 2004\nLouden up, kids\nOne of the few good bands to come out of the supposed dance-punk revival, !!! brought\ntheir insane live show to the city. Tom Hampton was there for Felix\n15\nLIVE REVIEW\n!!! (most frequently pronounced\n\u2018chk chk chk\u2019) crashed into the indie\nlimelight recently on the crest of a\nwave of similar New York dance-punk bands such as The Rapture\nand Radio 4. However, !!!\u2019s sound is\ntruly their own. A mix of fashionistas\nand other student types greeted the\neight-strong band at the Astoria,\nready for a heady mix of energy-filled dance numbers taken mostly\nfrom the new album Louden Up\nNow.\nThroughout the evening, three\ncircular projection screens burnt a\nsequence of dazzling, progressively\nmore psychedelic images onto an\naudience already bathed in thick\npercussive beats, swirling guitar\nlines and copious flashes of strobe\nlighting.\nLead singer Nic Offer cavorted\nwildly, dancing cathartically, rigid-ly, often just plain stupidly to the\nmusic behind him, all without a hint\nof irony. Well, maybe just a small\nhint. After barking incomprehensible vocals and occasionally resorting to making abstract noises and\nbreathing sounds, it was all change\nas drummers took vocals, guitarists\nplayed keyboards, bassists picked\nup trumpets and someone, some-where, hit a cowbell or two.\nMulti-instrumentalists abound in\nthis band, and the fired-up punk\naesthetic coupled with programmed\nbeeps, tweaks and trance-esque spiralling song structures made for an\nembracing experience.\nStand out tracks were difficult to\npick out; the well-known Me And\nGiuliani\u2026 single, stretched out to\nover eight minutes, caused the biggest crowd response. Fun was had\nby all, ranging from gently swaying\nheads to rave-dancing in pockets,\nall rippling through the crowd. Nic\ninteracted with the audience well,\ndespite splitting his jeans, and there\nwere several well-intentioned mini\nstage invasions, cheerfully resolved\nby all involved. These were the\ncause of much satisfaction to the\nband, despite the bassist being confused for a jubilant fan and getting\nroughly handled himself towards\nthe end of the set!\nThere\u2019s no pretending that !!!\nwill have a bestselling album, nor\nwill they achieve emphatic commercial success with their brand of\nexperimental genre fusion.\nHowever, their music and performance are so bubbling with crisp,\nsurging blasts of dance and new-wave punk cool, leaving every muscle in the body twitching excited-ly, that the band deserve all their\nrecent superlative critical appraisal.\nI can only recommend investigating\nfor yourself.\n!!!\nAstoria\nHHHHI\n!!! in the park... but where is the cowbell?\nALBUM REVIEWS\nThere are bands who constantly\ndevelop their sound, striving to\nevolve and move on, surprising fans\nand critics alike with every release.\nThen there are those who have found\ntheir signature sound and decided to\nstick with it. You hear them and say,\n\u201cthat\u2019s them, no question\u201d.\nIt doesn\u2019t take much cerebral\nactivity to work out which camp\nPlacebo belong to. No indeed, the\nmusic industry\u2019s most brazen nancy\nboys found the noise they liked with\ntheir debut, self-titled, album, and,\nas this collection shows, they haven\u2019t\nfelt the need to change it.\nTheir sound is an angsty nasal\nwhine backed up by droning guitars and a solid, repetitive beat. An\nacquired taste, it\u2019s actually rather\nmore appealing than I\u2019ve just made\nout, although it really shouldn\u2019t be.\nIt should be absolutely bloody awful,\nand, while I don\u2019t doubt that there\nare millions of people who think\nthat it is, I can\u2019t suppress a creeping fascination for the crazy gay\nLuxembourgers (is that a word?)\nYes, Brian Molko\u2019s voice has a tendency to give me a migraine after\ntoo long. Yes, it\u2019s as predictable as\nthe USA winning the World Series\n(apart from that crazy rapping thing\nthey did on Black Market Music).\nBut there\u2019s something hypnotic\nabout it all. Despite the occasionally obscene lyrics, their music has\na friendly, soothing quality to it that\nquite belies its superficial anger. Not\nmany groups consisting of a teeny-tiny androgyne in lipstick, an impossibly tall bassist and, er, that other\nguy could come off as homely and\ncomforting as your favourite blanket\nbut, if you listen to them enough,\nPlacebo can manage it.\nThis collection of all their singles\nis a brisk and faithful trot through a\nsuccessful but never stellar career,\nand although it misses some of their\nhidden album-only gems it\u2019s consistently interesting to fans. The most\nexciting track, though, is one that\nhas never previously been available in the UK \u2013 Prot\u00e8ge-Moi, the\nFrench version of Protect Me From\nWhat I Want, a song from their latest\nalbum, Sleeping With Ghosts. In his\nnative language, Molko becomes\na husky little sexpot with a drawl\nthat could fell admirers at twenty\npaces, rather than the shrill pixie\nwe\u2019ve come to know. It\u2019s a new and\nnoteworthy side to Placebo, as is\nthe short but mostly sweet new love\nsong I Do. The sound is no differ-ent, but the emotions have changed,\nbecoming more tender and cutely\npathetic. Perhaps we are seeing progression here? I wouldn\u2019t count on it,\nbut it\u2019s a nice thought.\nSo, this is really one for collec-tors, or beginners. However, I leave\nyou with this thought: the band was\nformed when Molko accidentally ran\ninto his former classmate, bassist\nStefan Olsdal, in South Kensington\ntube station. They\u2019re local boys. Give\nthem a chance.\nAnna Novitzky\nThis album is long overdue. At\nlast, an indie band that\u2019s neither\nembarrassingly poppy (see Keane),\nor blandly predictable (see Snow\nPatrol or Thirteen Senses). This is\nan album that will lead you into a\ndarkened room to whisper to you all\nyour darkest secrets, tuck you into\nbed and kiss your cheeks, stained\nby the tears it caused you to cry. It\nis truly as overblown as that last\nsentence, and yet darkly humble,\nriddled by it\u2019s own insecurities.\nThis strange schizophrenia\ncomes across clearly in the lyrics.\nLost In The Plot warns you \u201cdon\u2019t\nmess with our love, our love is so\nmuch stronger\u201d, whereas Pinned\nTogether, Falling Apart bites it\u2019s\nnails since it\u2019s \u201cpetrified by the\nthought of losing you, absolutely\nhorrified by the thought of losing\nyou\u201d. The Dears are blessed with\nthe perfect vocalist for their style\nin the form of Murray Lightburn.\nHis voice is rich, dark, deep and\nsmooth; confident yet tentative.\nThe album opens with We Can\nHave It, with a fragile intro caressing you with beautiful acoustic\nguitar and vibraphone. It teases\nyou with this for two minutes\nbefore exploding into a flurry of\novert instrumentation. Lightburn\u2019s\nvocals soar skywards for the rest of\nthe song, taking you along for the\nride, frantically promising you that\n\u201cyou\u2019re not alone\u201d and sending the\nhairs on the back of your neck into\ncardiac arrest.\nThe instrumentation and musicianship is breathtaking through-out. Who Are You, Defenders Of The\nUniverse\u201d is in sinister 6/8, blindingly complex, and rocky to boot.\nThe Second Part and closer No\nCities Left both feature an accordi-on, and flutes and strings are used\nas staple instruments.\nThe variety on No Cities Left is\nstartling. Postcard From Purgatory\nis echoey and loud, drenched in\nfeedback, and accelerates into a\npsychedelic whirlwind of tambou-rines, flutes and distorted guitars.\nNever Destroy Us sounds like a\nBond theme, suave, sophisticated\nand jazzy.\nA couple of minor bad points:\nDon\u2019t Loose The Faith does absolutely nothing, a very bland, going-through-the-motions kind of song.\nExpect The Worst/Cos She\u2019s A\nTourist starts as one of the best\ntracks, with choppy cellos, The\nOmen style choir, an Arabian feel,\nstart stop rhythms and a tempo\nchange, but then drops of to nothingness for six minutes.\nNothing you can love will ever be\nperfect, a truth The Dears will happily impart to you before drowning\nyour sorrows with their genius mel-ancholia. Essential listening; you\nneed this in your life.\nJames Millen\nPlacebo\nOnce More With Feeling:\nSingles 1996-2004\n(Elevator)\nHHHII\nThe Dears\nNo Cities Left\n(Bella Union)\nHHHHH\nNancy boys done good\nFelix waxes lyrical about The Dears and reappraises Placebo\u2019s singles\nPlacebo: the ever elfish Brian Molko, and the other two\nThe band practise carrying giant invisible dustbins\n\n"

So after a gentle jog all\nthe way to Canterbury, while\nfinding the time for a lengthy\nstop at England\u2019s largest second hand bookshop, arriving\njust 15 minutes late wasn\u2019t\nsuch a bad result.\nThe team entered the\nhall with presence \u2013 everyone turning to look, possibly\nbecause of good looks, perhaps because of reputations,\nor maybe just because Pierre\nwas foaming at the mouth,\nwho knows. The fact of the\nmatter was that Imperial\nwere there to get down to\nbusiness.\nFirst match. Foil. Imperial\u2019s\nweakest weapon. Rory first on\nthe piste. Bang! Bang! Bang!\nHe puts the bitch down. Up\ncomes Hugo. Pure class. Kent\ndoesn\u2019t know what\u2019s hit them.\nFinally, the Big Man: Eric Lai\nwas solid as a rock, with a very\ngood performance against a\ntalented fencer. The rest of\nthe match didn\u2019t go quite as\nwell and Imperial lost 45-42.\nIt was close enough, with the\nbig guns still to come.\nNow for the sabre. Easy\nwin for the team. Pierre did\nImperial proud despite \u201cnot\nfeelingit\u201d.Ididn\u2019taskwhat\u201cit\u201d\nwas mainly because I know\nwhat that boy\u2019s like. Rory\nmade his second appearance,\nstunning the crowd with his\nalmost Jedi-like skills. Eric\nshowed himself more than\ncapable of holding his own\nwith his weakest weapon. 45-30. Nice.\nNow Imperial had the lead\nin their grasp, with just the\nep\u00e9e to go. There were concrete performances from\nHugo and Matt, with Eric\nreally coming into his own.\nAn effective set of fights took\nthe score to 45-37, making\na grand total of 132-112 in\nfavour of Imperial. First win\nof the season. Sure not to be\nthe last. Well done team, keep\nup the good work.\nOnaslightlymoreimportant\nnote, the girl Pierre seemed\nto find quite attractive apparently thought someone else\nto be considerably better than\nhim. Damn that handsome\ndevil...\nFENCING\nLate start, winning finish\nLACROSSE\nMulleted striker\u2019s offside goal\ndenies Fourths victory\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 2\nRVC Men\u2019s 1st 2\nBy Michael Nicholson\nImperial Fourths started off\nthe season against an experienced RVC side, who had\njust achieved two consecutive promotions.\nAn early blow was dealt\nwhen striker Jai was ruled\nout during the extended\nwarm-up, which was caused\nby a flat tyre on one of the\nRVC vehicles.\nDespitetheprolongedwarm\nup, it was RVC who started\nthe match stronger, with\nImperial looking like a team\nwho hadn\u2019t played together\nvery much (funny that), and\nthe vets were unlucky when\ntheir mulleted striker, who\nmust be about 104 by now, got\nto a cross ahead of captain\nVanni and crashed a header\nagainst the bar.\nIt came as something of\na surprise when Imperial\ntook the lead against\nthe run of play. The move\nstarted when Tim (to borrow\na phrase from Thirds captain Shatters) \u201cbeefed\u201d one\nof their midfielders with a\ntremendous tackle and the\nball broke to Paul in mid-field, who threaded a quality\nball through to Shwin.\nShwin held the ball up before\nplaying in Demetris, who\nremained calm and curled\na beauty of a finish around\nthe \u2018keeper and into the cor-ner! Get in! Subsequently,\nthe Fourths woke up, started\nplaying and coasted into\nhalf time with the lead\nsafely intact.\nThe second half started\nabysmally when some idiot\ngot nutmegged by the Mullet,\nleaving him a clear run to the\nby line. He crossed well to his\nunmulleted strike partner,\nwho had an easy tap-in.\nImperial showed incredible fighting spirit to bounce\nback and retake the lead with\nShwin\u2019s first goal for the club.\nHe received the ball in the box\nafter a neat one-two on the\nleft between Ed and Chris,\nturned well and smacked it\nin. Another beauty!\nAnd that should have\nbeen that, with the Imperial\ndefence holding firm and\nthe vets\u2019 attacks becoming increasingly panicked.\nThen one of RVC\u2019s brutes at\nthe back punted the ball\nup the park in the vague\ndirection of the Mullet\nwho was about half a mile\noffside. Vanni, expecting the\nimminent whistle, let the\nball run. The Mullet sensed\nan opening and nipped in to\nnod the ball into the empty\nnet. Imperial couldn\u2019t really\ngive a shit, and placed the\nball ready for the free kick.\nHowever, the referee whistled for the first time in\nthe match and gave a goal.\nUnbelievable.\nThe game petered out into\na tame draw, when a morale\nboosting victory for the\nmighty Fourths would have\nbeen the least they deserved.\nStill, quality performances\nfrom everyone mean that\nthe team look a good bet for\npromotion. The reward for\nthe vets is a place alongside\nHolloway on the list of teams\nwe hate.\nFOOTBALL\nA member\nof the\nFencing Club\nin action in\nHong Kong\non their\nsummer tour\n\n"

    "content": "October can be rather hectic,\ntrying to find time for your\nstudies while running around\nto all the corporate presentations and recruitment fairs\nand filling out those time-con-suming application forms.\nAlthough final year and\npenultimate year students\nare the targeted audience\nfor these presentations (and\ncertainly the big companies\nusually only open internship\napplications to these years),\nallstudentsshouldtakeadvan-tage of this annual merry-go-round. It\u2019s a good way to start\nforming ideas about what\nyou might like to do when\nthe time comes to find a job.\nKnowing what interests you is\na big help, as you can then set\nabout gaining the appropriate\nwork experience and developing the relevant skills so that,\ncome application time, you\u2019re\na star candidate. Employers\nwill want examples of the situations from which you gained\nsuch skills, so organising\nextra-curricular activities is\nvital.\nThe real value of company\npresentations and recruitment fairs is in meeting the\npeople and making contacts,\nand thereby getting a better\nfeel for the organisation. You\nshould be able to find most of\nthe necessary information on\ntheir website and by researching the company and sector.\nIn general, not too much is\nsaid at the presentations that\nyou won\u2019t already know if\nyou\u2019ve done the research.\nEven if you won\u2019t be applying this year, attending these\nevents can help you discover\nwhat you want to do (or what\nyou definitely don\u2019t want to do)\nanditmayalsomakeyoumore\naware of how the recruitment\nprocess works and the level\nof competition. Big employers\nhardly need advertise themselves and actually use presentations and workshops as\na way to start finding potential recruits. They will often\ntake down the contact details\nof students who have made\nthe right impression and may\neven invite them to a smaller,\nselect gathering. So, if you\u2019re\nplanning on applying, think\nof some intelligent questions\n(not already answered in\nthe brochure) and introduce\nyourself.\nIt\u2019s also useful to observe\nthe networking that goes on at\nthese events, what impresses\nthe company representatives and what doesn\u2019t. You\nwill often see them trying to\nmake a quick getaway from\nthe know-it-alls, the numb-ingly boring types and the\nclueless types who start with\n\u2018well, I\u2019m not really sure what\nI want to do\u2019. Try to \u2018click\u2019 with\nthem \u2013 at the end of the day,\nthey want to employ people\nthey get on with.\nUnfortunately, the recruitment events tend to lack\ndiversity and are dominated\nby the large financial/busi-ness institutions. For those\nwho don\u2019t see themselves in\nan office in the City, you may\nhave to step off campus and\ntake the fair elsewhere.\nHot on our heels, The\nTimes has brought out a\nnew Careers section (every\nThursday) which covers\npretty much everything in\nbite-size pieces, one of which\nlast week was entitled \u2018Be discreet if your aim is to become\na spook\u2019. MI5 is number 63\nin The Times 2004 Top 100\nGraduate Employers, so\nthere\u2019s an idea if the thought\nof PricewaterhouseCoopers\nor Citigroup doesn\u2019t really\ndo it for you. With phrases\nsuch as \u2018information gathering\u2019, \u2018careful research\u2019 and\n\u2018interpreting data\u2019 being\nused to describe the work of\nthe secret service, Imperial\nshould be a recruitment hotbed for MI5!\nMaking the most of recruitment season\nCareers felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 21 October 2004 9\nWhether you\u2019re embarking on your initial research\nin order to choose a career\nor you\u2019re ready to target a\nspecific company, graduate\nrecruitment exhibitions are\nan excellent forum for meeting your potential employer.\nIt\u2019s hard enough for graduates to get on the first rung of\nthe recruitment ladder, and\nthere isn\u2019t a better way to\nmake an impression than in\nthe flesh. I personally went\nto this exhibition at Wembley,\nand I advise all of you to go to\nthe next one. Whatever you\nwant to be, you\u2019ll find a career\nplatform. There is something\nfor everyone, from finance,\nscience and consultancy to\nlanguages, marketing and\nsales. You can meet recruiters face-to-face and get a feeling of the company you are\ninterested in, plus lots more.\nYou can attend free career\nseminars and company pres-entations, or sit down with an\nexpert that will go through\nyour CV at the \u2018CV clinic\u2019.\nThere is also the opportunity\nto attend interviews and hand\nin your CV, if your career is\nalready clear to you. If you\nwish to visit the CV clinic,\nmake sure you get there early\nto avoid the massive queue!\nAfter filling out a registration form, I first went to\nGCHQ\u2019s stand. Does the\nname mean anything to you?\nWell, before going to the\nexhibition, I certainly didn\u2019t\nknow about the Government\nCommunications Headquarters. These days you hear a\nlot about the British intelligence agencies, but have you\never thought of joining one?\n\u2018Heard but not seen (until\nnow)\u2019 is how GCHQ introduces itself. GCHQ reports to the\nForeign Secretary and work\nclosely with the UK\u2019s other\nintelligence agencies (com-monlyknownasMI5andMI6).\nTheir primary customers are\nthe Ministry of Defence, the\nForeign and Commonwealth\nOffice and law enforcement\nauthorities, but also a wide\nrange of other Government\ndepartments.\nWhat you are allowed to\nknow is that they work to\ncounter the numerous threats\nthat face the nation and\nthe global community. This\ninvolves using cutting edge\ntechnology to intercept communications and electronic\nemissions.\nGCHQ has two missions:\nsignals intelligence (Sigint)\nand information assurance.\nSigint work protects the\nvital interests of the nation,\nproviding information to support the Government in foreign policy decisions, military\noperations and law enforce-ment.\nInformation assurance\nhelps keep Government communication and information\nsystems safe from hackers\nand other threats. The intelligence they provide is at the\nheart of the fights against ter-rorism, international crime,\ndrug trafficking and weapons\nof mass destruction.\nI was interested to find\nout their recruitment crite-ria. Mandeep Kuner, GCHQ\ntechnologist and mathemati-cian, said: \u201cWe recruit from\na broad spectrum of disci-plines, with a minimum of\na 2.1 degree. There are different positions such as lin-guists, technologists, applied\nresearchers, intelligence ana-lysts, finance specialists and\nvetting officers, just to name\na few. Therefore, science, lan-guage, engineering, IT and\naccountancy degrees are all\nwelcomed\u201d.\nI wanted to know which\nspecific skills GCHQ seek\nin an applicant \u2013 \u2018analytical\nskills\u2019 seem to be a major\nrequirement. Work experience in any institution is a\nbonus. After speaking with\nKuner, my impression was\nthat you must be exceptional\nto succeed in the selection\nprocess which includes application forms, psychometric\ntests, interviews and going to\nan assessment centre. If any\nof you are interested in such\na career, the website www.\ngchq.gov.uk has all the necessary information on how to\napply: www.gchq.gov.uk.\nThe next stop I made was\nto ACNielsen BASES, a leading company in new product\nconsulting, providing sales\nforecasts and market analysis to companies around the\nglobe. Positions in this company again are not limited to\nany specific degree area.\nI approached Paula Wright,\nthe HR manager, who told\nme: \u201cThe main requirements\nwe expect from an applicant\nare very strong client service ability with analytical and\nmultitask skills. We accept\ngraduates with a minimum of\na 2.1 degree but they must be\nenthusiastic individuals with\nthe ambition to learn\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cWe are very\ndisappointed with the students we came across here\ntoday. They want to know\nfrom us what we can offer\nthem and what the company\nis about. We ended up being\ngiven hundreds of CVs, but\nnobody impressed us particu-larly. It doesn\u2019t take much to\ndo a little research about us\nand to come prepared. We\nare looking for researchers\nand they should at least know\nhow to do that. The best way\nto impress us is to show some\ninterest and knowledge about\nus, otherwise we will not consider them further\u201d.\nThe message is quite clear:\nshow the company that you\nare very passionate and interested in them. There is no\nway you will be selected above\nhundreds of other applicants\nif you do not make an effort.\nBe sure to visit presentations, recruitment fairs and exhibitions like this one at Wembley\nCareers\nevents\nand\nuseful\nlinks\nTALK\nSUCCESSFUL\nAPPLICATIONS\nThursday 21 Oct, 1\u20131.50pm\nClore Lecture Theatre, Huxley\nBuilding\nTALK\nPOSTGRADUATE STUDY\nIN THE USA\nTuesday 26 Oct, 1\u20131.50pm\nClore Lecture Theatre, Huxley\nBuilding\nTALK\nIT & THE CITY\nThursday 28 Oct, 1\u20131.50pm\nClore Lecture Theatre, Huxley\nBuilding\nEVENT\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nCAREERS FAIR\nWednesday 3 and Thursday\n4 Nov, 11am\u20134pm\nBeit Quad\nLINKS\nhttp://www.ic.ac.uk/careers\n(Visit this site for a full list of\nemployer presentations)\nhttp://www.shell-livewire.org/\nthebigtrip\nhttp://www.prospects.ac.uk/\nhttp://www.newscientistjobs.\ncom/graduate/\nhttp://www.doctorjob.com\n\u25cf The Careers section\nappears in Felix every\ntwo weeks\nCASSANDRA ALDRICH\nCAREERS EDITOR\nStarting to shape your future\nA look back at this year\u2019s National Graduate Recruitment Exhibition\nGABRIELLA SILVESTRI\nCAREERS EDITOR\n\n"

You will\nsee simple feedback forms placed\naround the Union building and cam-pus. We welcome your comments\nand look forward to receiving them\nand acting on them. When a student completes a feedback form, we\nguarantee that a response will be\navailable online at www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/yoursay within seven days. In\naddition, responses will be posted\non the notice boards in the Union\nfoyer and the Student Activities\nCentre. As well as filling in a feedback form, you can also contact us\non yoursay@imperial.ac.uk.\nSo please do use \u2018Your Say\u2019 as\nan opportunity to provide constructive feedback. Your views are vital\nto us in ensuring that Union services respond to your needs and\nwants. Feedback will also allow us\nto explain why things are done, and\neither allow us to change them to\nbetter reflect what you want or at\nleast let you know why things you\nwant can\u2019t happen, due perhaps to\nlegal or financial constraints.\nIn addition to the \u2018Your Say\u2019 programme of regular feedback, this\nterm we will also be embarking\non College-wide market research\n\u2013 professional surveying of students\u2019\nopinions. This will form part of our\nsubmission to the Quality Assurance\nAgency\u2019s audit of the College (more\non this in coming weeks) as well\nas gaining valuable input from\nyou to the strategic review that will\nbe undertaken by the Union this\nterm.\nThe strategic review will be looking at the future strategy of our\nUnion and how best we can channel\nour resources to deliver high quality\nservices and make the Union work\nfor you. Through this, we hope to\ndevelop a plan of how the Union\nwill evolve over the next few years,\nand put us in a strong position for\nextra recurrent funding and capital\ninvestment.\nThe strategic review will also help\nus develop a masterplan for the\nUnion building. We have an excellent spacious building, but it needs\nrefurbishment and changes in order\nto serve our students better. For\nthis, the relevant committees and\nthose using the building will be\ncalled upon to work, together with\nthe results of our market research,\non what the Union plans for the\nfuture.\n\u25cf Sameena Misbahuddin is the\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices) of Imperial College Union.\nHer remit is to oversee the financial\naspects of the Union, including club\nand society finance, as well as the\nUnion\u2019s services, including its commercial services.\nSAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(FINANCE & SERVICES)\nLast week we held a cross campus\nballot election for members of Union\nCouncil and its Committees. Council\nis the Union\u2019s \u201cparliament\u201d. It sets\nUnion policy and holds Officers (like\nmyself) to account. It is incredibly\nimportant that we have a full, elected Council, so that it has legitimacy\nin acting as the representative voice\nof students.\nOne of the absurd aspects of Union\nCouncil is that in the past it has been\n\u201celected\u201d by the people who turned\nup to the first meeting \u2013 typically no\nmore than about 50 or 60 students\n\u2013 out of a population of over 10,000.\nI took the view that this had to stop\nand this year instigated the online\ncross-campus ballot. It wasn\u2019t perfect but it was the first time that the\nvast majority of students had had a\ngenuine opportunity to elect their\nCouncilors. As you will have read\nelsewhere in Felix, the result was\na very large victory for RON (Re-Open Nominations). So there will be\na new set of elections.\nWhy?\nWhy did so many of you vote for\na new election? Why, in so many\ncases, as a result of second or third\npreferences after your first choice\ncandidate? Various Union \u2018types\u2019\nhave made representations to me\nrequesting that I remove the RON\noption from the new set of elections.\n(I can\u2019t actually do this, by the way,\nwithout first getting approval from\nthe College Council to suspend our\nregulations). Whilst I am prepared\nto contemplate getting rid of RON\nit makes me deeply uncomfortable\nand I am loathe to do it.\nWhat is RON there for? It is an\nopportunity for the electorate (in\nthis case, you, the students) if you\nbelieve that it is better to have a\nnew election than to have any of\nthe (remaining) candidates elected.\nThat option should always be there\nbut it should never be taken lightly.\nDid you really think the candidates\nwere that bad?\nDid you understand the Single\nTransferable Vote (STV) voting sys-tem? Did you realise that you are\nsupposed to list candidates in order\nof preference until you have no further preference? Did you realise\nthat voting RON as number 2 does\nnot in any way increase the chances of your first choice candidate of\nbeing elected?\nWhere now?\nThere will be a new election for the\nmajority of posts that were contested in the last set of Union elec-tions. I was very pleased with the\nturnout of 1093 compared to about\n50 last year. However, I need people\nto not vote RON and elect a full set\nof Councilors. How do we make this\nhappen?\nWould more incentives for voting\nreally help? Do you need more information about the candidates? Do\nyou want information in different\nways?\nShould the Union better promote\nelections and what they are intended\nfor? Do you appreciate the responsibilities associated with the positions that you are electing? Should\nwe make it easier for candidates to\nstand (if you were genuinely worried\nabout the quality of candidates)?\nBasically, I can\u2019t read your minds\n(most of the time). And ultimately\nI\u2019m here to serve you. Elections\nare fundamental to the democracy\nof any students\u2019 union and we have\nto make them work. If you have any\nideas please, please suggest them\nto us. Pop in and chat, or email\nelections@ic.ac.uk.\n\u201cHey, buddy! How\u2019s it going?\u201d A\nfamiliar and friendly form of address,\nperhaps, but what is a buddy? Hours\nof meticulous research revealed that\na buddy is \u201ca good friend; a comrade\u201d, but why am I talking about\nbuddies here?\nWell, the Buddies Scheme at\nImperial is a system of pairing up\nfreshers with continuing students.\nIt\u2019s as simple as that! But how does\nit work? Well, each Faculty Union\nruns a slightly different scheme. For\ninstance, Imperial College School\nof Medicine Students\u2019 Union calls\nits buddies \u2018Mums\u2019 and \u2018Dads\u2019, and\npairs them up with a fresher of\nthe opposite sex. For entirely innocent reasons, I am told. In certain\nEngineering departments, on the\nother hand, precisely the opposite\napproach is taken, as females are in\nshort supply.\nMost departments stump up\nsome cash for a Buddies\u2019 Lunch in\nFreshers\u2019 Week, presumably under\nthe assumption that most of Mum\u2019s\nhunger relief packages have been\neaten by the end of the week. The\nBuddies\u2019 Lunch is a good opportunity for freshers to meet their bud-dies, alleviate some of their initial\nconcerns, learn a few things about\nthe course, and obtain some inside\nknowledge. Departmental Societies\nusually exploit such occasions to\npublicise their existence and plug\ntheir events.\nSome Faculty Unions are running\nfollow-up buddies\u2019 events, which\nrange from parties to milkshake and\ndoughnut giveaways. Sometimes\nthey work well, although this very\nmuch depends on the relationships\nthat exist between freshers and\ntheir buddies. The most successful way of getting students together\nappears to be by offering free food.\nI guess we are all united by the fact\nthat we have to eat!\nWhilst some Faculty Unions take\ncare to match freshers to buddies\nwho have similar interests or back-grounds, others leave it to chance,\nand in any case, it is never possible\nto ensure that buddies and freshers\nwill actually get along. In the best\ncase scenario, the relationship will\nbe a constructive one which will\nhelp the fresher to settle in more\neasily, and may even develop into\na friendship.\nWell, what am I getting at? I think\nthe Buddies Scheme is a good idea,\nwhich generally works well, but\nneeds to be built on in the future. I\nam going to be getting the organisers together to discuss ways in\nwhich we can make it even bet-ter, so if you have any suggestions,\nplease get in contact. To open another can of worms entirely, should\npostgraduates have buddies? Let\nme know!\nOn a personal note, if you are a\nbuddy and have not been in contact\nsince Freshers\u2019 Week, it might be a\nnice idea to remind your freshers\nthat you still exist and are there to\nhelp if they have any concerns.\nElections\nI could not let this week pass without mentioning the E-word. As\nmany of you will know, we held some\nelections last week for positions on\nCouncil, various committees, and\nsome Faculty Unions [see News,\npage 2].

With an impressive\ncast, the movie was bound to be a\nsuccess at the box office \u2013 the likes\nof Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese\nand Ren\u00e9e Zellweger attract the\nmore mature moviegoer, whereas\nWill Smith, Angelina Jolie, Jack\nBlack, Missy Elliot and Christina\nAguilera are sure to spark the\ninterests of a younger generation.\nHowever, Shark Tale tries too hard\nto please everyone, and the result\nis a mildly amusing cartoon that\nhas none of Nemo\u2019s charm. The few\nfunny moments in the film come\nfrom references to Jaws and gangster films, which are sure to be lost\non much of the younger audience.\nThe film is disappointing visually.\nMain character Oscar\u2019s world is\na sprawling submarine American\nmetropolis,completewithbillboards,\nsushi restaurants and prawn shops.\nThe fish live in a brand-driven world\nin which they drink Coral-Cola, eat\nKelpy Kremes and communicate\nwith shellfones. The main characters all have a visual likeness to their\nHollywood voiceovers: the shark\nmob boss has De Niro\u2019s mole, Sykes\nhas Scorsese\u2019s bushy eyebrows, and\nOscar has Smith\u2019s big lips.\nAs movies go, Shark Tale is about\nas unoriginal as they come. As a\ncamp, cross-dressing shark, Lenny\nis the only imaginative character.\nFinding Nemo had a simple plot\n\u2013 a father\u2019s desperate journey to\nfind his son. Shark Tale is a whole\nlot more complicated. There is the\nlove triangle that is Oscar, Lola and\nAngie. There are Oscar\u2019s dreams\nof making it big and his adventures\nas a shark slayer. Finally, Lenny\u2019s\ntrouble at \u201ccoming out\u201d to his father\nabout his culinary (read sexual)\npreference is yet another subplot in\nthis cluttered film.\nShark Tale simply doesn\u2019t come\ntogether and relies on a loud, extravagant ending to leave the audience\nfeeling satisfied.\nHarry Moore\nSomething smells fishy\nTwo different views on what happens when one little fish tells a great white lie\nShark Tale\nDirector: Bibo Bergeron, Vicky\nJenson, Rob Letternon\nStarring: Will Smith, Robert De Niro,\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger, Angelina Jolie,\nJack Black, Martin Scorsese\nLength: 90 minutes\nCertificate: U\nHHIII\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nOscar (left), played by Will Smith, placating the puffer\nWimbledon courting\nWimbledon is the scene for this\ngood old-fashioned love story. Even\nif you are not a tennis fan, the film\nis worth watching, as the tennis\ndoesn\u2019t dominate. The plot follows\nPeter Colt (Paul Bettany, Master\nand Commander) as the lucky\nBritish wild card to the Wimbledon\ntournament. His game is slipping,\nhis back failing, his spirit dying. His\nrank has slipped form 11 to 119. Colt\nhas major problems with his game\nand at home. He knows his time is\nup as a pro on the tennis courts and\nhas already accepted a job helping the more senior citizens with\ntheir swings at a health club. This is\nhis last Wimbledon. Every romantic\ncomedy needs a hopeless lost soul\nthat has given up on love, and Peter\nColt is it.\nCue the romantic interest,\nAmerica\u2019s new talent Lizzie\nBradbury (Kirsten Dunst,\nSpiderman 2), the John McEnroe\nof women\u2019s tennis. She\u2019s the bitch\non the court \u2013 tough, focused and\ndetermined. Nothing will stop her\nfrom winning this Wimbledon, especially men. Her father (Sam Neill)\nwill make sure of that. Still, the phenomenal Lizzie cannot help but fall\nfor Peter\u2019s charms, but how can she\nhandle a relationship and a career?\nSomehow Peter manages to work\nhis way through the tournament; his\ndream of winning one of the most\nprestigious tennis tournaments is\nnear realisation. Lizzie is Peter\u2019s\nsalvation.\nPaul Bettany is the perfect character for the role. You love him, you\nwant him to win, you\u2019re sitting on\nthe edge of your chair for the cliffhanger ending, biting your nails.\nYou want him to get the girl, and you\nprobably already know the answer\nto whether he does or not, but that\ndoesn\u2019t matter in the end when you\nwalk out of the cinema and feel\nuplifted and generally contented\nfrom this heart-warming film.\nDunst also adds her usual affability to the role. Peter\u2019s amicable character is synonymous with the role\nof a struggling British tennis player,\nthereby making the audience will\nhim on, both in the matches and in\nhis moments with Lizzie. He is the\ntransformed hero of Wimbledon.\nThere\u2019s tension and suspense, and\nit\u2019s just like watching Tim Henman\nagain. Can Peter cope with the onerous burden of national expectation?\nWimbledon is given authenticity through real commentators,\nsuch as John McEnroe and Chris\nEvert. It even captures the sporting\ndrama of narrow escapes and tense\nfinals. This film will appeal to all\nthose Henmaniacs, however sitting\nthrough it has all the predictability\nof one of Henman\u2019s semi-finals.\nWimbledon is a light-hearted and\nclever film.

Produced by the same\nmakers as Shrek and Shrek 2\n(DreamWorks), this film is very\nsimilar in style to its predecessors,\nincorporating jokes that although\nintended for the whole family may\nbe more fully appreciated by a more\nadult audience. There are also many\nreferences to other films such as\nJaws and The Godfather, which are\nmost likely to be recognised by older\nviewers.\nWith an enjoyable, lively, largely\nhip-hop soundtrack, the film is set\nin the animated underwater equivalent of New York. Based more from a\nhuman perspective than an aquatic\none, scenes include many clever\nfishy puns and plays on words such\nas Kelpy Kremes and Coral Cola.\nIf, like me, you love everything\nabout Will Smith, especially as the\nFresh Prince of Bel Air, you will\nalso love his character as computer\ngenerated fish Oscar.

    "content": "By Gemma Buckland\nBiomedical sciences\nOn 1 October 2005, the prospect of reducing soaring\ngreenhouse gas emissions\nwas made a reality when\nRussia signalled that it is\nready to ratify the Kyoto protocol and become the final\ncountry to join the climate\nchange treaty.\nNow 30 industrialised countries have been legally bound\nto this agreement. First initiated in 1997, it states that by\nthe year 2012, member countries need to collectively cut\ntheir emissions of six major\ngreenhouse gases to 4.8%\nbelow 1990 levels.\nThe agreement is set to create a multibillion pound carbon trading market, whereby\ncountries will be able to buy\nand sell \u2018saved\u2019 carbon. So in\nexceeding targets, a country\nwill be in the position to sell\nits saved carbon credits to\ncountries who have failed to\nmeet theirs.\nThe EU has been set an\noverall target of 8% reductions and the UK 12.5%, which\nwe are currently on target\nto exceed by 3%. However,\nplans to sell the UK\u2019s saved\ncarbon will not go ahead as\nit will apparently be required\nto meet the more stringent\n2012 plans.\nIs this agreement enough?\nAlthough \u2018tougher targets\u2019\nare scheduled for 2012, to be\nmet by 2020, it is unclear how\nrigorous these will be, and\na complete plan for future\nemissions has not been\nmapped out. Scientists claim\nthat a 60% reduction across\nthe world is essential in order\nto lower runaway climate\nchange possibilities, mass\nextinctions, and the severe\nrises in sea levels feared.\nOf course, the US still has\nnot changed tact on this\nissue and refuses to sign\nthe treaty. It is not hard to\nsee why, given the current\nadministration\u2019s well-docu-mented financial links with\nthe multinational corporate\ngiants of America, who just\nhappen to be the companies\ncontributing the most to the\nworld\u2019s carbon dioxide prob-lem. Take for example the\nTexan oil giant ExxonMobil,\nselling petrol under the Esso\nname, which produces more\nthan twice the CO2 pollution\nof Norway, with the company\u2019s own figures citing its\n2003 emissions as exceeding\n135million tonnes of carbon\ndioxide. The annual profits of\nthis company reached a modest $17billion last year. With\nno plans to implement reduc-tions, ExxonMobil is one of\nmany US opponents of the\nKyoto agreement. So considering this and the fact that\nthe US is the world\u2019s largest polluter, will the protocol\nhave any effect?\nFor a significant decline in\nglobal CO2 levels, all countries will need to commit.\nHowever, developing countries and large polluters such\nas China and India do not\nhave to comply with Kyoto.\nSo on its own the protocol\nwill not have any major effect\nand, according to scientists, if\nemissions start rising again\nafter 2012, the treaty will prevent less than 0.1\u00baC of the\nwarming expected by 2050.\nThe Bush administration\nclaims that premature expensive measures, such as those\nbeing used for Kyoto imple-mentation, are not as important as research into better\nemission-reducing technolo-gies. However, whether they\nmaintain this stance when\nthey are left out of the mul-timillion carbon market\nremains to be seen.\nThe Kyoto agreement is a\nstep in the right direction,\nbut climate scientists want\nto see a global cap of critical\ngases put in place. Deciding\nupon the individual quotas is\na difficult job to tackle, and\nimplementing these quotas\nwill prove expensive, but this\nis an expense that cannot be\nspared.\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 21 October 2004\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n5\nRussia signals willingness to ratify Kyoto treaty\nPutin: directed his ministers to sign up to Kyoto \u201cas soon as possible\u201d\n\u201cThis agreement is set\nto create a multibillion\npound carbon trading\nmarket where\ncountries will be able\nto sell \u2018saved\u2019 carbon\u201d\nScience\nin brief\nBy Alex Antonov\nMathematics department\nChangeover at ISS\nA crew of three arrived successfully at the International\nSpace Station (ISS) on Saturday on board a Soyuz space-craft.

Since\nthe Columbia shuttle disaster\nlast February, Russian spacecraft have provided the only\nmeans of travelling to the ISS.\nFDA approves microchip\nimplants\nA Florida-based company, Applied Digital, has been given\nthe go-ahead to implant microchips in humans for the\npurpose of storing an individual\u2019s medical records. The\nmakers of the grain-of-rice-sized chip say it will carry\ndetails of blood groups and\nallergies that can be used in\nemergencies.\nCritical QC component\nbuilt\nA team of physicists at Purdue University has created\na device that can perform\nspatial spin separation of the\n\u2018holes\u2019 in gallium arsenide.\nThis is thought to pave the\nway for producing \u2018spin-polarised\u2019 streams of electrons.\nWith further development, the\ndevice might play a key role in\na quantum microprocessor.\nSurgery rebuilds\npatient\u2019s face\nDoctors in Tokyo used a single\nflap of skin from a patient\u2019s\nback to perform the first full\nface reconstruction, including\nthe nose. The skin on the patient\u2019s back was stretched using a silicone tissue expander\nfor six months, which caused\nthe skin to grow with its own\nunique blood supply.\nMagnetic stars puzzle\nsolved\nScientists at the Max Planck\nInstitute have discovered the\nmagnetic field configurations\nbehind the strong magnetic\nfields observed on the surfaces of magnetic A-starts\nand white dwarfs. The results\nsupport a hypothesis proposing that the magnetic fields\nare remnants of the magnetic\nfield in the gas clouds from\nwhich stars are born.\nDraft of bovine genome\nreleased\nAn international team based\nin Houston is in the process\nof reading through the cow\u2019s\nlife code. The cow genome is\nsimilar in size to the genomes\nof other mammals. Scientists\nbelieve the study could help\nunderstanding of human genetics and disease, as well as\nimprove the health of cattle.\nOrganic farming under the spotlight\nNew study questions whether organic is better for the environment\nBy James Berry\nBiochemistry department\nOrganic farming does more\nto enhance the countryside\u2019s\nwildlife than conventional\nfarming, claims a report published last week in Science.\nThe rapid expansion of\nthe organic food market in\nrecent years, with growth\nrates increasing between 30\nand 50% per annum, is partly\ndue to the favourable effects\nthe public perceives organic\nfarming to have on the envi-ronment.\nLast year, sales of organic\nfoods in the UK exceeded\n\u00a31 billion for the first time.\nThe industry\u2019s environmentally dependable image will\nsoon be further strength-ened, in terms of legislative\nand financial assistance,\nafter recommendations from\nthe Government\u2019s recent\nCommission on the Future of\nBritish Agriculture are carried out.\nAlthough the benefits of\neating GM and pesticide-free\nfood are not in question, big\nbusiness and environmental\nawareness are often not seen\nas compatible. The expansion of conventional agriculture over the next 50 years is\nexpected to challenge climate\nchange as the key threat to\nglobal biodiversity [1]. So can\nthe billion dollar organic food\nindustry continue to trade off\nits environmentally responsible image forged during its\nsmallholding past? A report\npublished last week by the\nRSPB and English Nature\n[2], may help allay consumer\nfears that ecological concerns aren\u2019t being bought off\nwith organic labels.\nThe study has taken data\nfrom Europe, North America\nand New Zealand, and\nreviews the impacts on field\nbiodiversity by organic and\nconventional farming prac-tises. The majority of the 76\nstudies found that both species richness and abundance\nwere improved under an\norganic farming regime. Of\nthe 99 sub-studies, examining various taxa, 67% were\nin favour of organic farming,\nwith only 8% against.\nSkylarks, greenfinches and\nblackbirds were found to be\nmore prevalent on chemi-cal-free organic farms; their\nnumbers supported by the\nboosted invertebrate popula-tions. Linnets, by compari-son, who feed from oil seed\nrape seeds common on both\ntypes of field, showed no discernible difference in popula-tion. Also, although organic\nfarming was not generally\nshown to affect small mammal populations, clear differences in bat activity suggested organic farms were\npreferable. In fact, two bat\nspecies, the greater and lesser horseshoe bat, have been\nfound to only visit organic\nfarms.\nIt\u2019s not just the absence of\npesticides that leads to greater biodiversity, but the recognition of the inter-depend-ency between living organ-isms. For example, the use of\nmanure instead of fertiliser\nencourages soil microbes\nand earthworms, who not\nonly provide a link in the food\nchain, but enrich and aerate the soil. Minimum tillage\nmodifies the floral community by favouring annual plants\nrich in nectar, as oppose to\nslow growing perennials, benefiting the pollenating insects\nand their predators, and also\nimproving the field\u2019s aesthetic appeal. A holistic approach\noptimises all aspects of the\nfield\u2019s ecology, and aspires\nto benefit both yield and sustainability in contrast to the\ncontinual human intervention\nrequired to optimise yields on\nconventional farms.\nThere are, of course, consistency problems for a\nreview of this size. For exam-ple, no account is made for\nwell-meaning conventional\nfarmers with a disposition\ntowards environmentally\nresponsible management\npractises, or for farms on\nwhich an organic transition\nhas only recently been made.\nBut although organic farming clearly has the potential\nto support the myriad of\nmulti-networking organisms\nthat is field ecology, the economic realities of the marketplace ensure that it will\nalways rely on the support of\nthe consumer.\nReferences:\n[1] Tilman, D. et al.

We may be\npaid postgraduates, but once\na student, always a student\nat heart!\nOur temporary greeting\nroom was welcoming enough,\nthe smell of fresh (well, pow-dered) coffee, biscuits and a\ntypical big warm grin greeting you from the president.\nIf only it had been like that\nall weekend. Saturday passed\nwith not much happening, so\nin their wisdom the events\nteam decided to shepherd\nall the new arrivals to one\nof our \u201clocal\u201d pubs. It was\nonly then that they realised\nlots of people had turned up\ntoday, resulting in the need\nfor multiple trips through the\nwinding streets of Berkshire,\ngradually getting more intox-icated. It was hard enough\ngetting everyone there while\nsober, but getting them back,\nwell, at least we didn\u2019t lose\nanyone. That was to change\nlater in the week.\nSlightlycalmereveningsfollowed, such as a night in the\nSilwood bar on the Sunday.\nI\u2019m not sure the Silwood bar\nhas had that many people\nin it this side of Darwin\u2019s\ntheory of evolution (for those\nnon-biologists \u2013 that\u2019s quite a\nwhile ago). Free alcohol was\non offer on the Tuesday with\na College-funded \u2018meet and\ngreet\u2019. We all got up on chairs\nand said a few words, which\nwas rather ironic as I am\nnot allowed to use a step ladder for my research but am\nallowed to stand on a chair to\nencourage students to drink\nand enjoy themselves!\nWednesday was supposed\nto be about eating rather\nthan drinking \u2013 the \u2018kitchen\ncrawl\u2019 \u2013 but with some kitchens supplying drink as well\nas food for the judging committee (not that that swayed\nour decision at all), it was\nanother hazy morning that\nfollowed.\nThe Thursday brought what\nfor most was the highlight of\nthe first week, the local pub\ncrawl. Those of you living in\nLondon may not understand\nthe excitement that goes with\nthis event out here as you\nare constantly surrounded by\npubs, but here it takes real\ndedication to get around all\nof them. This is where the\nevents team organisation faltered for the first time. The\ntheory isn\u2019t hard: get from\npub A to pub B then pub\nC, while avoiding the beer\nmonkey (more details to fol-low). However, it\u2019s a little\ncomplicated when it\u2019s dark\nand only one person in the\ngroup knows the way from\nthe third pub to the fourth,\ndespite the efforts of a helpful\nbut inebriated yokel. Anyway,\nthe upshot is that to my\nknowledge only two people\nwere lost, myself being one!\nWithout a leader, everybody\nsoldiered on bravely and got\naround all the pubs, and the\ndetached party regained contact at the last pub just in\ntime for last orders.\nFriday morning was hazier\nthan most and as a result only\na minibus of hardcore drinkers made it out to Reading for\nclubbing, but those who did\nwere in for a treat. There was\nTom\u2019s calm driving under\nClare\u2019s navigation (or lack\nof), and the barman was an\nex-Silwoodian and so gave\nSilwood half pints to all.\nThankfully for many, the\ncycle pub crawl and sports\nwere postponed as livers\ncried out in unison for a day\noff and the desire to remain\nhorizontal.\nSo it is from my room, while\nalmost horizontal, that I write\nto inform the outside world of\nthe goings-on in this remote\npart of the Imperial world.

The pouring\nrain, coupled with the prospect of facing one of London\u2019s\nmost notoriously tempestuous sides, meant today would\nbe a baptism of fire for the\nnew faces in the Imperial\nranks. Passion and commitment would be the orders of\nthe day.\nAs expected, the early\nstages of the game were\nfrenetic, with neither side\nmanaging to hold onto pos-session, and time on the\nball was a scant commod-ity. Unfortunately, Imperial\u2019s\nremodelled 3-5-2 formation\nwasn\u2019t quite gelling. In par-ticular, the midfield three\n\u2013 debutant Louis joining old-timers Berksie and\nMcMahon \u2013 were failing to\nmake their numerical advantage count, allowing Queen\nMary to dominate most of the\nearly play. However, fresher\nPat Farr was already making a big impression, and\nalongside Paul \u201cthe Club\u201d\nMills, and Tom \u201cG-Unit\u201d\nGray, the Imperial back three\nresponded to everything that\nwas thrown at them. When\nMary\u2019s did manage to breach\nthis blue and black fortress,\nCarlos Alberto Vasquez made\nlight of the \u201ckeeper\u2019s nightmare\u201d conditions and dealt\nwith every shot or cross with\nhis usual unflappable author-ity.\nDespite their disjointed\nstart, Imperial were prepared\nto battle hard, and gradually clawed their way back\ninto the game. One attacking\nforay down the right flank\nforced a throw-in deep in\nthe QM half. As the ball was\nthrown long, Oli used his considerable bulk (all 87 kilos of\nit) to great effect, his flick-on running through to \u201csogood-they-named-him-twice\u201d\nBenji-Benji. The ball ricocheted between a defender\nand the Spanish youngster,\neventually running loose to\nthe edge of the box and into\nthe path of Imperial trickster Mathan. The Sri Lankan\nwizard\u2019s intelligent first time\nside-foot fooled both defenders and goalkeeper alike,\nsqueezing inside the near\npost to put Imperial one up.\nTo compliment his excellent\nfinish, Mathan made full use\nof the slippery conditions,\ncelebrating in exuberant\nKlinsmann style: 1-0.\nMoments later, Matty was\nalmost on the scoresheet\nagain, however this time he\nnearly provided Queen Mary\nwith an equaliser. As the ball\nfizzed across the Imperial\narea, Mathan\u2019s miscued\nclearance flew alarmingly\nquickly towards the wrong-footed Carlos\u2019 goal. Luckily,\nthe Peruvian cat recovered\nhis footing in time to stick\nout a leg and divert the ball\nfor a corner, sparing the\nblushes of Mathan. This was\nthe last meaningful incident\nin a first half that offered little to the neutral observer,\nthough Imperial were more\nthan happy to enter the break\nahead.\nIn the second half, the\nweather failed to improve.\nSadly, neither did the quality\nof play \u2013 sexy football this was\nnot! However, with three vital\npoints up for grabs, Imperial\nwere prepared to fight tooth\nand nail to preserve their\nlead. Through sheer force\nof will, the men from South\nKensington began to domi-nate.\nIn response, Queen Mary\nlost their discipline, and having scythed Oli down in the\nfirst half, QM\u2019s captain dived\nin on Benji. This earned the\nMary\u2019s number four a yellow\ncard, and Imperial a dangerous free kick in the perfect\nposition for Louis\u2019 cultured\nleft foot. Worse was to follow\nfor the mullet-bearing centre\nback, and as Louis curled the\nball over the wall, he seemed\nconfident the ball was sailing\nover the bar, calling to his\nmen: \u201cAll day, all day...\u201d\nUnfortunately for Mary\u2019s,\nthe only thing worse than\nhis judgement was Tom G\u2019s\ntie collection, and as the ball\ncareered off the crossbar, the\nQM defence stood stationary.\nThis left Oli and Joe to fight\nover the rebound, the captain\nscreaming loudest to head\npast the hapless QM keeper:\n2-0. This second goal would\nsurely secure the game for\nImperial, and the elation was\nthere for all to see on the\nfaces of Oli and his troops.\nWith the game now seemingly beyond them, Queen\nMary switched their attention from scoring goals to\nkicking lumps out of the\nImperial team. In particu-lar, the Mary\u2019s number eight\nproved that Robbie Savage\nmight not be the most irritating footballer on the planet.\nHowever, Imperial were not\nprepared to rise to this bait,\ninstead concentrating on\nholding out for a clean sheet\nand deserved three points.\nAmidst the deluge, the referee finally brought proceedings to a close. Despite the\npouring skies, Imperial\u2019s joy\nwouldnotbedampened.Along\nwith a winning start, Imperial\nhad much to celebrate, with\npromising debuts for Benji,\nLouis and Chris (a second\nhalf substitute for the ever-reliable Timur). However, no\none had a better game than\n\u201cman-of-the-match-on-hisdebut-and-birthday\u201d Pat, who\nwas a rock in the Imperial\ndefence for the whole ninety\nminutes.\nThis may just be the start of\na long season, but then even\nthe longest journey begins\nwith the first step. Great\nthings await...\nImperial \u2018rain\u2019 supreme\nFOOTBALL\nThe 2003-4 Imperial first team, most of whom were\nprobably involved against Queen Mary last week\n\n"

    "content": "Christopher Reeve became an\ninstantly recognizable hero as\nthe invincible Superman. His\ndeath last week, after years\nof suffering from paralysis\ncaused by broken cervical\nvertebrae (the vertebrae at\nthe very top of the spine),\nhas focused attention on the\npossible cures for such an\nailment. Reeve himself was\nan adamant campaigner for\nresearch into such cures,\nnever losing hope of finding the \u201cmiracle cure\u201d that\ndoctors assured him did not\nexist.\nTowards the end of his life,\nReeve had become increasingly interested in a form\nof therapy involving human\nstem cells. This field has\nundergone rapid metamorphosis from being speculative and fantastic into being\na very realistic and tangible\nprospect; it is now promising\nto deliver the \u2018miracle cure\u2019\nReeve had hoped for. Yet,\ndespite his hope, there are\nstill many potential pitfalls\nassociated with the therapy,\nhidden snags that could yet\nderail progress in this field.\nA stem cell is an undifferentiated cell that occurs in\nthe blastocyst, the human\nembryo that is three to five\ndays old. The stem cell has\nthe potential to, when subjected to certain conditions,\nspecialize into a specific type\nof cell, such as a heart mus-cle, red blood or nerve cell.\nEmbryonic stem cells are\nobtained from surplus egg\ncells that have undergone\nin vitro fertilization, with the\nconsent of the parents. These\ncells are then sub-cultured\nto form embryonic stem cell\nlines amounting to thousands\nof cells. The concept is to\ncause these cells to specialize by replicating certain con-ditions, forming the desired\ncells which are then transplanted into the body in the\narea of damage. In the case of\nChristopher Reeve, neurons\nwould have been cultured for\ntransplant into his spinal cord\nin order to repair the damage and allow him to fulfil his\ndream of walking again.\nThis, however, is a still a\ntheoretical form of treatment.\nThe barriers that have prevented further development\nin this particular field are\nnumerous. Ethical problems\nexist in that each embryo\nthat is taken apart to access\nthe stem cells themselves is,\narguably, still a developing\nhuman being. What are its\nrights? What if it has a soul?\nThese what-ifs, and many\nmore, have caused many\ncountries around the world to\nban stem cell research. The\ncultured cells may also have\ngenetic abnormalities that\ncould manifest themselves in\nthe patient who receives the\ncultured transplant.\nCancer may cause a prob-lem, as may tissue rejection.\nThere are also license problems \u2013 gaining access to the\nstem cells from the embryos\ncreated by in vitro fertilization is a long and costly pro-cedure.\nIn response to these ethical concerns, it is often said\nthat the idealistic concepts of\nwhat the embryo is, and what\nrights it has, are preventing\nthe progress towards saving\nthe lives of millions of people\naround the world who could\nbenefit from such reaserch.\nDo we deny the needs of those\nwho suffer, and condemn\nthem to further suffering, by\nupholding these idealistic\nbeliefs? We ask if we have\nthe right to access the cells of\nembryos, but do we also have\nthe right to say to the millions\nof Christopher Reeves in the\nworld: we cannot liberate you\nfrom your condition because\nthe means by which we would\nare reputedly unethical?\nYet before we lament the\nethical and medical drawbacks of this research that\nmay prevent the full realization of its potential, an alternative method has similarly\nexcited research scientists.\nUntil recently, it was widely\nbelieved that human cells,\nonce specialized, are then\npermanently so \u2013 they cannot then be used to culture\nother types of cells. This,\nhowever, has been proved\nfalse. If treated with certain\ngene activators that occur in\nthe embryo, adult cells, for\nexample skin cells, can regain\ntheir multipotency (ability to\ngrow into any type of human\ncell); that is to say that they\nrevert to an embryonic condition that causes them to be\nundifferentiated in a similar\nway to embryonic stem cells.\nTherefore, by the activation\nof the desired genes (bear\nin mind that every cell in\nthe body which possesses a\nnucleus also possesses the\ncomplete human genome, ie\na copy of every single gene in\nthe body), the adult cell can\nbe used to grow the desired\nspecialized cells needed for\ntreatment.\nThis form of treatment dramatically reduces the ethical and medical drawbacks\nassociated with embryonic\nstem cell technology. Since\nthe adult cells would be taken\nfrom the patient who needs\nthe cultured cells, the cells are\nalready \u2018theirs\u2019; they would\nnot be augmenting their own\nbody cells with those of anoth-er. There is no risk of cancer\nand no risk of tissue rejec-tion. An undeveloped human\nbeing is not being sacrificed\nfor their benefit. No \u2018souls\u2019\nare being tampered with; no\ncomplex licenses are needed\nto access the stem cells as\nthey would be for accessing\nembryos. The benefits are\ncountless: Parkinson\u2019s dis-ease, diabetes, heart disease,\nvision and hearing difficulties,\nas well as the traumatic spinal cord injuries such as that\nwhich affected Christopher\nReeve, can all be treated\nusing this form of therapy\nwithout too great a leap of the\nimagination.\nIt seems that medical\ngroups around the world\nare on the brink of a major\nbreakthrough that can make\nall this realistic. Reeve was\na dreamer; a Superman as\nmuch before his death as\nafter. His bravery in the face\nof inevitable and permanent\ndisability was heroic. Yet we\nmay be approaching an era\nwhere the scope for such\nbravery will be diminished, as\nthose who suffer from these\nhorrific ailments will be able\nto access the resources which\nwill cure them.\nReeve was a pioneer in\ncampaign for the finding of\nthe \u2018miracle cure\u2019; it may be\nthat such a cure is not as distant as it may seem.\n\u25cf The Christopher Reeve\nparalysis foundation:\nwww.christopherreeve.\norg\nOn the brink of finding a Supercure?\nChristopher Reeve lived with the hope that one day stem cell research would enable him to\nwalk again.

Your views next week\nDeath of Jacques Derrida and the hidden dangers of television\nJacques Derrida was reputedly the world\u2019s greatest living philosopher, but his death\nended up causing more confusion than grief.\nMany thought that the news\nof Derrida\u2019s death symbolised something completely\ndifferent. Perhaps a hoax,\nan attempt at post-modern\nhumour by the old man.\nDerrida was the father of a\nschool of thought that became\nvery fashionable in the sixties and seventies, known\nas \u2018deconstructionism\u2019. This\nweek, a whole host of websites have popped up trying to\n\u2018deconstruct\u2019 the announcement of his death in terms of\nits actual social significance\nand meaning.\nSome deconstructionists\nhave concluded that Derrida\nis not actually dead, but is\nvery much alive. In the sense\nthat his death symbolises a\nform of rebirth into the new\nsocial construct. According\nto deconstructionist thinking,\nevery piece of text has multiple or even infinitemeanings.\nSo \u2018Jacques Derrida is dead\u2019\ncan even mean \u2018Jacques\nDerrida is alive\u2019, given the\nright context. You also have\nto remember that death itself,\naccording to some decon-structionists, symbolises\ncertain culturally ingrained\nprejudices against those who\ncan no longer breathe. Forget\nFelix for a minute, even The\nTimes found it difficult to\nwrite Derrida a fitting obitu-ary:\n\u201cCan there be any certainty in the death of Jacques\nDerrida? The obituarists\u2019\nobjective attempts to place\nhis life in a finite context are,\nnecessarily, subject to epistemic relativism, the idea that\nall such scientific theories are\nmere \u201cnarrations\u201d or social\nconstructions\u201d.\nThere was also a story this\nweek about the 20-year-old\nOregon student who owned a\nToshiba flat-screen TV that-was accidentally emitting an\ninternational distress signal.\nThis signal was picked up\nby satellite and led to a rescue operation involving local\npolice and civil air patrol\ncentred around his flat in\nCorvallis, Oregon.\nThis is very disconcert-ing. You could be relaxing at\nhome watching a film and\nsuddenly have a crack commando squad smash through\nyour windows, storming the\nhouse looking for the HMS\nInvincible. Hopefully, the\nauthorities in the UK have the\nskills to distinguish between\na submarine distress signal\nand the faint buzzing of a TV\nmonitor.\nCould a TV monitor really emit a signal that would\nbe picked up, relayed and\ninterpreted by a satellite as\nan SOS signal? Even if the\nsignal was at the right fre-quency, what are the chances\nthat it would match an SOS\nsignal? I have my doubts\nabout this story, but the likes\nof CNN and Reuters obviously do not.\nThis week, Science goes\ninteractive.

Dr Buttle agreed\nto amend her proposals to\ninclude the Union President\nas a member of Council.\u201d\nVarious other changes to\nthe governance of the College\nwill still go ahead, including\nthe downsizing of the Council\nitself, which will in future contain only one elected academic staff member. There are\ncurrently six of these on the\ngoverning body, and although\nDr Buttle\u2019s initial proposal\nwas to remove them all, a\nconcession has been made\nallowing a place for one of the\nDeans.\nMr Arif was keen to point\nout that, because the Council\nwill now have less members,\nthe level of student representation has actually increased\n\u2013 instead of there being one\nstudent member out of 25\n(plus several observers),\nthere will now be one out of\n19. He commented: \u201cFrom a\nstudent perspective, we\u2019ve\ngone from potentially zero\nrepresentation to something\nthat\u2019s better than the present\nsituation.\u201d\nThe new, smaller Council\nwill now discuss issues that\nwere previously covered by\ncommittees which no longer\nexist. This will give students\na direct input into these areas\nfor the first time.\nThe Council was widely expected to endorse the\noriginal proposals, and the\namendment has been greeted\nby many as a pleasant sur-prise. When asked how he\nand other student officers\nhad managed to convince\nCouncil members of the need\nfor student representation,\nMr Arif replied: \u201cThe important thing was to influence\nthe key decision-makers...\nthe most important people\nwere the Rector and the\nCouncil Chairman.

    "content": "most likely you\u2019ll find yourself refilling water bottles from the unisex\ntoilets for most of the night.\nThe somewhat restrictive prices\nare compensated for by the awesome light displays, which are some\nof the best imaginable. The lights,\nthe music, the DJs, the MCs, the\natmosphere... the list is endless,\nso if you\u2019re into drum and bass,\nI would definitely recommend you\npay Fabric a visit. I\u2019ll see you there.\nNacho Quinones\nSo, Fabric is five. Five years on,\nand it\u2019s still going strong. Stronger\nthan ever, it would appear. I arrived\nshortly before midnight \u2013 somewhat\nstupidly, as I knew this was going to\nbe a busy one \u2013 and the queue was\nleading around the corner and down\ntowards the tube station. Not a good\nsign. If I hadn\u2019t had a ticket I doubt\nI would have waited. As we entered,\nsecurity looked about ready to turn\naway the majority of the waiting\nmasses.\nI remember last year\u2019s birthday\nweekend, when they brought free\ndrinks into the middle of the dancefloor just before chucking out time,\nand someone threw a load of glow\nsticks into the crowd (quite shocking considering they are banned in\nthe club), so I had been looking\nforward to this night for a long time,\nespecially since I hadn\u2019t been down\nthe giant staircase in a good few\nmonths.\nOnceinside,Iwaseagertogetright\ninto the midst of things, so it was\nstraight into the main room for me.\nI have to admit I was slightly taken\naback, as the place wasn\u2019t jumping\nlike I had expected. Electronic duo\nDeath In Vegas were in the middle\nof their live set, which seemed odd\nto me \u2013 usually at FabricLive the\nlive acts perform first, then clear\nthe stage for the clubbers. Tonight,\nhowever, it seemed I had missed\nStanton Warriors and Richard\nFearless. Death In Vegas were playing their signature style of dirty\nelectronica, and, whilst intense and\natmospheric, the beat rarely got fast\nenough to have a proper dance to.\nMoving into Room 2, I found\nsimilarly downbeat proceedings, so\nheaded up to Room 3 to check out\nTalvin Singh on the decks.\nTalvin is an astounding artist. His\nproduction work is a beautiful fusion\nof Eastern and Western sounds, and\nI have a passion for his music. I\nhadn\u2019t ever seen him DJ, however.\nIn Room 3, he was spinning what\nwas at the time the most upbeat\nmusic in the place, though I have to\nsay it didn\u2019t really sound like him.\nHe was playing a dubby kind of\nhouse, but I gave him the benefit of\nthe doubt and over the next hour or\nso the sound progressed and got a\nlot more interesting, causing me to\nget a right old wiggle on as he started bringing elements of bhangra\nand other more esoteric styles into\nthe mix.\nBefore long, I felt the urge to check\nout Room 1 again, especially as I\nknew breakbeat god Adam Freeland\nwas playing. Just as Death In Vegas\nwere finishing, the room, and the\nwhole club, seemed a lot more full\nthan when I had arrived, as if the\nwandering masses had swarmed to\nsee Freeland. I wouldn\u2019t blame them\n\u2013 he\u2019s at the forefront of his scene\nand has been all over the place\nrecently. You probably know him\nbest for his danced-up version of the\nWhite Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army\nor his beatsy bootleg of Smells Like\nTeen Spirit, but his own tracks, such\nas We Want Your Soul, have been\njust as popular. If you want to hear\nwhat this man is all about, check out\nhis FabricLive 16 mix CD for a nice\nslice of dark and growling breakbeat\npie.\nThe breakbeat scene has exploded\nin the past few years, but it\u2019s not a\nnew sound. Ask any old school raver\n\u2013 dance music has always had a lot\nof breaks in it, right from the start.\nWhat I\u2019m referring to came out of\nthe garage scene a few years ago, as\nproducers took the two-step beats\nand heavy bass and left out the\nsexy soulfulness to create warping,\nbumping, grinding music which had\na fresh sound about it. These days,\nbreaks is massive, taking in elements of house, hip-hop and drum\nand bass, as well as a fair amount of\nremixing and re-remixing (notably\nthe Plump DJs\u2019 rework of Donna\nSummer\u2019s I Feel Love).\nStep onto a dancefloor when a\nman like Freeland is playing, and\nyou\u2019ll soon see what the hype is all\nabout. People go wild for this music\n\u2013 the beats, being more varied and\nsometimes more random compared\nto straight, four-to-the-floor house,\ngive rise to some crazy body mov-ing, twisting and jerking. Add to this\nbasslines that could rearrange your\ninternal organs, and you\u2019re surfing\non a wave of sound. And it feels\ngood.\nFreeland\u2019s set lived up to my\nexpectations 100%. It was tight,\nresounding and fresh. The crowd\nloved it, and so did I.\nNext up were the Plump DJs. The\nPlumps are just as big as Freeland,\nbut with a slightly different take\non the breakbeat vibe, favouring a\nmore funky, disco sound. Tonight,\nhowever, they went straight for the\njuggular, with beats sounding harder and basslines deeper than what\nhad come before. They rocked and\ntwisted the crowd right through to\nthe end of the night, which was\nmy only real disappointment. You\u2019d\nexpect, for their birthday, that the\nclub would stay open a little longer,\nbut tonight the lights came up as\nusual, and it was game over. Fair\nenough really, we all had beds to go\nhome to, and it had been one hell of\na night.\nSimon Clark\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 21 October 2004\n16\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBirthday Bonanza\nLast weekend, London superclub Fabric celebrated its fifth birthday. Felix was there to check out the party\nFabric cannot have escaped your\nattention. Not only is it one of the\nbiggest clubs in town with a capacity of around 3000, but their publicity is almost ubiquitous \u2013 you will\nbe handed stylishly designed Fabric\nflyers on your way out of almost any\nclub, as well as gigs and concerts.\nSituated in Farringdon, Fabric has\nbuilt up an incredible reputation \u2013\nsome people don\u2019t go anywhere else.\nFabricLive (Fridays) and Fabric\n(Saturdays) are two of the most\nconsistently solid nights out in town,\nwith impressive line-ups of live acts\ncovering the spectrum of music with\nbreaks, drum and bass and house,\nathough the music policy explicitly\nstates \u2018no trance\u2019!\nLast weekend, Fabric was five.\nThe celebrations were held over\nthree days, with the club unusually\nopen on a Thursday night for a pure\ndrum and bass mash up, and Friday\nand Saturday in the familiar format.\nNacho Quinones went down on\nThursday to check out the action,\nand I was there for all the fun on\nFriday.\nSimon Clark\nNightlife Editor\nCLUB REVIEWS\nSo I went to Fabric on Thursday. The\nline-up for the whole weekend was\nimpressive, but on Thursday it was\nimmense!\nAll your favourite drum and bass\nDJs were there: Grooverider, Nicky\nBlackmarket (who kicked ass in dBs\nlast year), Goldie and DJ Hype, back\nto back with the grandaddy of drum\nand bass, Andy C. Individually, wick-ed. Combined? Unmissable!\nOn the Circle Line, I was surrounded by baggy-trousered, bling\nbling, red-eyed clubbers all shaking\nwith anticipation. When we got to\nFarringdon it was pretty much a\nrace to beat the omnipresent Fabric\nqueue, which to everyone\u2019s surprise\nwas notable by its absence. Once\ninside, the club was pretty packed\nbut not quite as full as it can get,\nprobably due to the midweek effect.\nBasically, Fabric is made up of\nthree main rooms and a couple of\nchill-out areas. I say \u201cchill-out\u201d in\nthe loosest of terms here, because\nthe music is too damn phat to sit\ndown, so most people use the couches as platforms really. As for the\nmain rooms, there is usually different music in each one, but this\nThursday it was drum and bass eve-rywhere, which I guess was Fabric\u2019s\nway of celebrating the fact that it is\none of the main drum and bass venues in the world.\nRoom 1 was the arena for the main\nacts and I found myself spending\nmost of the night there. Grooverider\nkicked off with some of the phattest\nbasses that I\u2019ve ever heard and the\noccasional slip-up was swiftly covered by some skilful MCing.\nThe main dish of the night was\nAndy C. This was obvious judging\nby how packed the room got when\nhe came in. To be fair, at Fabric you\ncan always expect a good amount\nof the old elbow-in-the-ribs, but I\nwould have to say that Andy C is too\npopular for his own good. He was as\ngreat as people tell you he is, but the\novercrowding in the room was as\nirritating as it was unavoidable.\nThe other rooms were comparatively empty, but the tunes were just\nas kicking with the added bonus of\nextra breathing space. The staircases are a popular area to gather what\nremaining strength you have left to\nget through the rest of the night. But\nyou\u2019ll find that you\u2019re not alone, as\nthis is the place where most people\ncome to chill, have a smoke and\ndecide on the next room to hit.\nDrinks at Fabric are at average\nclub prices, which is bad news for us\nstudents! I would definitely recommend that you get plenty of pre-club\ndrinks in before you get in there, as\nFabric Fifth Birthday\nWeekend: Thursday\nFabric\nHHHHI\nAdam Freeland\nFabric Fifth Birthday\nWeekend: Friday\nFabric\nHHHHI The almost omnipresent Fabric queue forms on Charterhouse Street\nFabric from the inside\n\n"

No bombs, no elections,\nno defrauding, no takeovers.\nDream on... and read on!\nCrude Oil\nCrude oil continued to misbehave as it reached new record\nlevels of $55 per barrel, an\nincrease of $2 from this time\nlast week. Brent Crude Oil\nFutures, the \u2018cheaper\u2019 version of that traded in the US,\nalso rose in line with it\u2019s past\nperformance to reach $51.50.\nHowever, the effects of escalating oil prices have not only\nstruck down company profits\nbut also affected the commodities markets in general, with\nclear evidence of unsettling\npatterns at the International\nPetroleum Exchange.\nCopper, aluminium and\nlead rose to new highs and\nthen dropped to levels seen\na decade ago, providing irrefutable backing for the suggestion that crude oil has\nsent the market into turmoil.\nFurthermore, many of the\nairlines will respond to the\ncrude oil price spike by raising their fuel surcharge by up\nto $2 and $8 for domestic and\ninternational flights respec-tively. Personally, I don\u2019t see\nthe logic behind travelling by\nair when you can go just as\nquickly by Scaglietti.\nBush-Kerry Affair\nWith just over two weeks to\ngo until the 44th US presidential election, it\u2019s a race\nfor the two prime candidates\nto convert as many citizens\u2019\nvotes to their favour as pos-sible. It appears as though\nboth candidates have a 50-50\nchance of victory.\nIn the last few weeks, there\nhas been an extensive campaign by both parties to convince the public of the correctness of their stance on\nissues such as healthcare,\npensions, economic and security concerns, education and\nof course the Iraq war. As for\nthe latter, Kerry has a decidedly strong stance that seems\nto be winning over the public\nen masse. Take, for example,\nthe debate on Wednesday last\nweek, where Kerry beat Bush\nhands down, mainly due to\nhis stance on political and\nethical issues.\nBush doesn\u2019t have a particularly strong foundation,\nespecially since he has had\nfour years to correct the state\nof the economy, and all that\nis evident after his term in\noffice is that countless jobs\nhave been lost, many more\ncompanies are now outsourc-ing, and in comparison to\nKerry\u2019s productivity in the\nSenate, not much has been\nachieved.\nAbbey National\nThe much awaited sell-out of\nAbbey National to Santander\nCentral Hispano (BSCH), one\nof Spain\u2019s largest commercial\nbanks, was finalised this week\nafter months of speculation\nand discussion. The \u00a38.9bn\nacquisition will supposedly\nmake the bank a \u2018stronger\nand a more competitive force\non the high street\u2019, according to Lord Burns, the much\njeered and heckled Abbey\nchairman.\nAs for the intricacies of the\ndeal, they are very much similar to most mergers or acqui-sitions; it has been decided\nthat the name Abbey will stay,\n3000 staff will be shown the\ndoor, the chief executive will\nbe replaced and the pleas of\nresistance of many investors\nwill be ignored. The final stages of the deal, which involve\nan approval by Spanish shareholders and the go-ahead by\ncity regulators, are expected to be completed by 16\nNovember. Upon completion\nof this deal, being overlooked\nby Morgan Stanley, Abbey can\nlook forward to being in the\nlist of the world\u2019s top 10 largest banks with an increase in\nits consumer dealings and a\nmuch wider client base.\nFor those of you who have\na stake in Abbey, the date for\nyour diary is 15 November,\nthe final day of trading of\nAbbey shares and the issuance of new BSCH shares. It\nshould come as no surprise\nthat Abbey shares have been\nthe most active recently, with\n40m of them changing hands\nat the close of business last\nFriday on the Dow Jones\nindustrial index.\nEnron again\nThree British bankers will\nappeal against the decision\nmade by a judge at Bow\nStreet Magistrates court to\nextradite them to the US to\nface litigation on charges of\nfraud and deception. David\nBermingham and two of his\ncolleagues will now await a\nfinal decision by the British\nHome Secretary. David\nBlunkett\u2019s decision will probably be based on whether\nthere is an actual need for\nextradition, if their human\nrights are being breached and\nif there is a proper basis for\nwhich the US can charge the\nbankers. The stakes are very\nhigh indeed for the bankers,\nwho face up to 30 years in jail,\na declaration of bankruptcy\nand a fine of $1-2m.\nEnron began life as an innovative trader of gas, electricity and other commodities,\nwith stock the most favoured\non Wall Street. Its problems\nbegan in January 2002 when\nformer Enron executive\nMaureenCastenadawasquestioned about the shredding\nof various documents. The\nSEC investigated and David\nDuncan, chief Enron auditor,\npleaded guilty to obstruction\nof justice with regards to the\ndocuments shredded. Enron\u2019s\nsubsequent collapse in 2001\nleft liabilities of about $80bn\nand workers with nothing in\ntheir retirement accounts\nafter the company filed for\nbankruptcy.\nIn2002,AndersonConsulting\nwas prevented from performing auditing work despite\nJoseph Berardino, CEO of\nArthur Anderson, explaining\nthe situation on NBC, and\nthus suspended many thousands of employees. Former\nEnron vice chairman John\nClifford Baxter committed\nsuicide, and George Bush\ncalled for tougher penalties\nfor corporate criminals and\na crackdown on boardroom\nscandals.\nThe culture at Enron was\nthat of bright graduates being\ngiven more than enough rope\nto hang themselves and free\nreign of how they managed\ntheir business and clients.\nWhat ensued was a group of\npower-hungry, money-mak-ing under-30s who felt ready\nto take on the world. The\norganisation was later found\nto be full of corruption and\nrife with false company statements that claimed Enron to\nhave millions of non-existent\nassets, such as a $250m gas\nreserve and thousands of\nmegawatt hours.\nAnd finally\u2026.\nThe EU has saturated its\nmembership and the addition\nof proposed states, including\nTurkey and Ukraine, will lead\nto the eventual degradation of\ngovernance, predicted Frits\nBolkestein, the EU\u2019s internal\nmarket commissioner.\nAfter the recent addition of\n10 new member states, bringing the total to 25, the EU\u2019s\ngoal of surpassing all the\nworld\u2019s economies to be the\nnumber one in 2010 seems to\nbe fading after every member state\u2019s addition, despite\nBolkestein\u2019s continuous prodding at European companies\nto converge to best practices.\nAll change at Abbey: the multi-million pound bank is set to be taken over within two weeks\nFrits Bolkestein expresses his concern at the addition of new states to the EU\n\n"

    "content": "It has been almost two years since\nthe row over top-up fees erupted.\nBuried beneath news that Imperial\nwas entering merger talks with\nUCL (which subsequently collapsed,\nlargely due to staff and student pes-simism) were disturbing mumblings\nfrom the Rector, Sir Richard Sykes,\nthat he was interested in raising tuition fees to up to \u00a33000 per year. So\nwhere are we two years later?\nNot so long ago, students received\na maintenance grant to help pay\ntheir living costs, with student loans\ncovering the gap. Fees didn\u2019t enter\ninto the equation. The explosion in\nthe number of A-level leavers entering higher education in the mid-nine-ties necessitated a change in tack,\nand the current system was born in\n1998. The maintenance grant was\nabolished, student loans increased\naccordingly and tuition fees of \u00a31000\n(now \u00a31150) per year introduced, payable up-front. Means testing reduces\nthe burden of these fees on students\nfrom poorer backgrounds \u2013 currently only 48% of students dependent\non their parents pay the full amount,\nwith 35% paying nothing at all.\nCollectively, students now owe\n\u00a314bn, and that doesn\u2019t even include\n\u201chidden\u201d student debts on credit\ncards, overdrafts and other borrow-ing. Then there\u2019s the interest, which\nis supposedly just to cover inflation\n\u2013 the current rate is 3.1%, but the\nconsumer price index recently fell\nto 1.1%. Something fishy is happening there.\nFor better or worse, this system\nis on the way out, so let\u2019s move on\nto the Labour government\u2019s new\nidea. Loans stay as they are with\n\u201cmodest\u201d increases, but tuition fees\nbecome variable \u2013 instead of the flat\n\u00a31150 fee, universities become free\nto charge anything between zero and\na top rate of \u00a33000 per year. Crucially,\nthe payment of fees is deferred until\nafter graduation \u2013 in effect, it adds\nto the student loan burden, and is\nrepaid in a similar fashion: 9% on\nearnings above \u00a315,000 per year.\nAttacks on the proposals take\nmultiple forms. Firstly, variable tuition fees inevitably create an education market, where price becomes\na selection criterion for university\nentrants considering where to go\nand what to study. The knee-jerk\nreaction to this is disdain \u2013 students\nshouldn\u2019t be basing their education\nchoices on cost. On the other hand,\nprice variation introduces another\nelement of competition into the sys-tem, perhaps boosting the incentives\nfor universities to improve teaching\nquality to everyone\u2019s benefit.\nThe universities themselves aren\u2019t\nkeen on a price war \u2013 those charging low rates may be seen as second rate, and admissions to more\nexpensive institutions could drop if\nstudents start checking their bank\nbalances when filling in their UCAS\nforms. In a recent BBC survey, 83\nuniversities in England were asked\nif they would charge the full \u00a33000 in\nfees, with 64% saying yes. Only 10%\nwould rule it out at this stage.\nThe exact amounts aside, should\nwe (as students) be paying at all?\nWhenever fees are debated, groups\nlike the NUS immediately start telling about student poverty, how none\nof us can make ends meet, how we\nmust work 40 hours per week to the\ndetriment of our studies and so on.\nUnfortunately, all these arguments\nagainst the new fee proposals are\nvoid thanks to deferred repayment.\nIn fact, by removing the current\nup-front fee, access to university\nshould become easier for those on\na low income. Critics argue that the\nprospect of debt in the longer term\nwill still deter those whose income\nis low now. However, since repayments only begin when the debtor\ncan afford them, is it really fair to\nexpect someone else to foot the bill\nfor irrational thinking?\nI also believe that tuition fees act\nas a useful deterrent to higher education \u2013 now before you spit your\ncoffee all over your Felix, hear me\nout. Not everyone needs or wants\nto go to university. Some people are\nat university simply because their\nparents want them to be. If there\u2019s\none thing that fees achieve \u2013 especially up-front fees \u2013 it is to make A\nlevel students (and their sometimes\npushy parents) think more carefully\nabout whether continuing their education at university is actually going\nto be worthwhile for them.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we should\nencourage people from all backgrounds to seek their educational\ngoals. Where appropriate, grants\nshould be offered (the only point\nthat all the main political parties can\nagree on), but perhaps not spread as\nliberally as some would argue. For\nexample: student comes from a poor\nbackground and receives significant\ngrants during education. After grad-uation, they convert their university\neducation into a high earning job,\nperhaps earning more than someone from a wealthier background. So\nwhy should they repay less?\nFor some time, the Conservatives\nhave proudly boasted that they\nwould scrap all fees, much to the\nrejoicing of the NUS and students\nin general. Unfortunately they then\nblew it by revealing exactly how they\nwould fund higher education \u2013 by\npushing up interest rates on student\nloans to commercial rates, capped\nat 8%. Currently the rate would be\naround 6.5%.\nControl of the loans would pass to\nthe universities themselves, so the\ncash raised from loan interest would\npay for teaching. The Conservatives\nestimate that this will raise \u00a320bn\nover a 20 year period.\nIt\u2019s easy to see right through this\ncynical scheme \u2013 not only do they get\nto grab the headlines with \u201cTories\npledge to scrap tuition fees\u201d, but\nthey satisfy their middle class roots\nby taxing the poor to pay for the\nrich. Think about it \u2013 richer families\nwon\u2019t take out the loan, so don\u2019t\npay the higher interest, and simply\nbenefit from having no fees to pay.\nEffectively they get a free education\npaid for by those of us supporting\nourselves on loans.\nLet\u2019s not forget that there are also\ngraduates who don\u2019t exploit their\nassumed graduate earning potential.\nSticking with relatively low-paid jobs,\nbe it by choice or otherwise, rewards\nyou with a debt mountain that grows\nat an unmanageable rate.\nWhat the Tories have inadvertently done is agreed with Labour,\nsaying that students, not taxpayers,\nshould pay for their education. All\nthey disagree on is the nitty-gritty of\nhow and when they should pay.\nThere is one redeeming quality\nof their plans, in that they want to\nallow students to take out greater\nloans to cover their living expenses.\nThere is definitely an argument that\nthe current loans are insufficient. I\nreceive the full loan of \u00a35050 per year.\nSupposedly, this should cover my\nexpenses for the whole 12 months,\nwhich works out to just over \u00a397\nper week. A little more room to\nmanoeuvre in the form of higher\nloans wouldn\u2019t hurt.\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrats\nare the only party that will stand\nup and declare that all taxpayers,\nnot just graduates, should pay for\nhigher education. They propose to\nscrap all fees and foot the bill by\ncreating a new top rate of income tax\nof 50% on earnings above \u00a3100,000.\nCurrently the top rate is 40% on\nearnings above \u00a340,000. As with the\nother two parties, their proposals\ninclude grants of up to \u00a32000 per\nyear to help with living costs for the\npoorest students.\nThis plan deals neatly with the\nproblem of graduates not achieving\ntheir supposed earning power, since\nthey won\u2019t reach the higher tax rate.\nSupporters agree that taxpayers in\ngeneral should shoulder the cost,\nsince education benefits the entire\neconomy.\nThe problem is that a large number\nof taxpayers will resent paying for\nother people\u2019s education, especially\nwhen students have a reputation for\ngettingupjustintimeforCountdown\nand then going drinking until chuck-ing-out time. This stereotype will\nonly get worse as the Government\ncontinues to insist that 50% of school\nleavers should go to university.\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject\nof the 50% target, what does the\nGovernment think will happen to\ngraduate salaries when the labour\nmarket is flooded with university\nleavers in the next decade? Supply\nand demand, anyone?\nIt\u2019s easy to say \u201cscrap fees, bring\nback the grant\u201d, but life isn\u2019t that\nsimple. Education will always have\na price tag on it, as everything does\n\u2013 it\u2019s a question of who pays, how\nthey pay and when they pay. So how\nshould it be done? Here\u2019s my eight\npoint guide to solving this situation\nto (almost) everyone\u2019s satisfaction:\n\u25cf Keep tuition fees capped at around\nthe \u00a31,000 per year mark, but defer\npayment to post-graduation.\n\u25cf Abandon the 50% target, and provide more information about non-university alternatives after A level.\n\u25cf Increase the available student\nloan by around \u00a31000 per year, ie give\npeople enough money so they can\nactually live off the loan.\n\u25cf Drop the interest rate on student\ndebt to more accurately reflect the\ncurrent inflation rate.\n\u25cf Increase the earnings threshold\nbefore loan repayments start to\n\u00a320,000 per year.\n\u25cf Scrap all means testing \u2013 since\nfee repayment is linked to graduate\nearnings, no differentiation is need-ed. Loans need to be available to\nall, regardless of what their parents\nshould contribute, since not all parents are willing to do so. Removing\nmeans testing will also reduce the\nadministrative workload in the student finance system \u2013 we all know\nthe dreaded forms!\n\u25cf Cover the funding gap by introducing a new top rate of income tax\nof 45% on earnings above \u00a3100,000\nper year (the precise percentage\nand threshold should be adjusted to\nmake the numbers add up!)\n\u25cf Encourage business to pay off\ntheir employees\u2019 student debts with\ntax incentives.\nSo students pay a bit when they\ncan afford to, taxpayers pay a bit\nwhen they can afford to, and nobody\nshould be hard up during their edu-cation. There, sorted. Next week I\u2019ll\ntackle world peace.\nJAMES ROBINSON\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 21 October 2004 7\nWho pays, how and when?\nThe major political parties\u2019 views on university funding\nBike racks: no \u2018joy\u2019\nDear Dave,\nI am writing to express my disappointment at the Deputy President\n(Education and Welfare)\u2019s column\n[\u2018The joy of... Bike Sheds\u2019] in last\nweek\u2019s Felix. Let me put my opinion\nin perspective with a few facts:\nFact 1: The new bike \u201ccage\u201d can\u2019t\nbe rejected out of hand. Some people want secure bike parking and so\nit\u2019s not a bad thing.\nFact 2: Most cyclists would much\nprefer the convenience of parking\nnear their department to the safety\nof parking in the cage. If you don\u2019t\nbelieve this, take a stroll down to the\ncage some afternoon and count the\nnumber of free spaces in the bike\nrack outside it \u2013 I guarantee it\u2019ll be\nless than five. Even when they are\nphysically there, people choose not\nto use the cage.\nFact 3: The \u201cstrategic concentration of bike parking\u201d means the\nremoval of much-used and convenient bike racks that caused no hassle to other users of the college. It\nmeans a reduction in real terms of\nthe number of bike space available\nto students. Apparently the Rector\nordered a cleanup of Imperial\nCollege Road and hence the racks\nwere removed. Maybe I\u2019ve missed\nthe point but isn\u2019t the Union meant\nto protect the students from exactly\nthis kind of facetious nonsense?\nI challenge anyone to explain to\nme how the overall situation for bike\nusers of this College has improved\nover the summer. There is no way\nthe College has done this with the\nstudents\u2019 interests in mind, and\nthere is no way our union should\nhave supported this event.\nI voted for a president whose campaign posters advertised \u201c600 new\nbike parking spaces for College\u201d. I\nvoted for a DP(E&W) who I thought\nwould put student needs first. I can\naccept that they have been outmaneuvered by College on this sub-ject, but to then turn around and\nsupport college\u2019s actions in Felix is\nunacceptable.\nTo paraphrase our president\u2019s\nrecent column, \u201cElected student\nofficers hold a position of trust.\nWhat is trust?\u201d. Trust is not letting\nthe college push through a policy which inconveniences the students when they\u2019re not even here\nto defend themselves, and trust is\ncertainly not publishing a defence of\nthose very actions after it\u2019s too late\nto reverse them. Well done to Sam\nfor organizing a meeting, but take\nit from me and my six years at this\nCollege, I guarantee you those bike\nracks will never reappear in College.\nWe had our chance to stop this and\nwe missed it.\nYours,\nPhilip Bates\nPhD student, Physics\n\u25cf Sam Rorke, Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare), replies:\nThe initial impetus for the College\u2019s\nnew secure cycle parking facility\ncame directly from the students,\nrepresented by the Union, as the\nhigh incidence of bike crime has\nbeen a longstanding concern. I\nthink this is what you are alluding\nto in \u201cFact 1\u201d. Two ways of doing\nthis were identified as providing\nsecure facilities, and concentrating\nparking in locations that could be\nbetter monitored.\nIn response to Fact 3, you don\u2019t\nalways get what you want in life.\nWe have fought hard to get a solution that bike users and College are\nhappy with. We have more spaces\nnow than a year ago. The Rector\nhas decided that he wants bike\nracks to be removed from Imperial\nCollege Road and located elsewhere\non the College Estate; Mustafa has\nspoken to him about this, and the\nonly way he is going to change his\nmind is if we can show that there\nis now insufficient cycle parking space. He won\u2019t have much\nsympathy for cyclists who consider it a divine right to park outside their building, and will now\nhave to walk for an extra couple of\nminutes.\nThe fact that people park their\nbikes outside the Faculty Building\nis entirely their own business. If\nthey do not want to use the facilities\nthat have been provided, then that\u2019s\nnot a problem.\nLetters to the editor\n\n"
