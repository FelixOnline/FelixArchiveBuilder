While I must concede\nthe fact that it is another extremely\npowerful blogging system with a\nfriendly User Interface (UI), I think\nit has become the MySpace of the\nblogging world. There are so many\nplugins that the Wordpress (WP)\nplatform has become a bit too cluttered.\nOn an average WP blog, a visitor can\nbe easily distracted by the page layout,\nthe interesting widgets on the sidebar\n(including a count of the tens of people\nwho have recently visited from across\nthe world) and the ability to log in and/\nor leave a comment.\nMeanwhile I feel that Tumblr (or\nYahoo for the commercially conscious)\nblogs are too sporadic in nature. They\ndomains.\u201d\nIf you choose to go ahead with\ninstalling Ghost on a server, you should\nfollow the easy official instructions\navailable on the Ghost installation\npage. The platform runs on the modern\nNode.js web framework, so be ready to\ninstall it.\nTip: Use the \u201cnave\u201d virtual\nenvironment manager for nodejs in\norder to keep your Node.js project\ndependencies separate. I\u2019m sure you\ndon\u2019t want to break an older Node.\njs app by upgrading your currently\ninstalled version :)\nAfter following the fairly simple\ninstallation guidelines (make sure you\npay special attention to the version of\nNode.js the project depends on - see\npackages.json file), the new blog will\nbe available on port 2368 of your new\nserver (also don\u2019t forget to change to\nchange the host to host: \u20180.0.0.0\u2019 in\nconfig.js otherwise you won\u2019t be able\nGoogle announced a few weeks ago\nvia a Google+ post that it has plans\nto create its very own smartwatch.\nNo concrete details on the wearable\ndevice are known as of yet, but\nthe sources across the netscape\nindicate that it could build on already\nestablished partnerships with HTC,\nAsus, LG and others.\nThe foray of Google into the\nwearable device industry raises the\ninteresting fact that despite the\nassumption made by many that Apple\nis the most innovative company in\nthe world, Google has in recent times\ndone much to earn that recognition,\nand its announcement to create a\nsmartwatch is further evidence of this.\nThe company has skillfully built on\nsoftware engineering, its business\u2019s\ncore competency, and has been able\nto generate innovative outputs like\nits driverless cars and the recently\nreleased Google glass. These two\nprojects are a testament to its business\nenvironment which harnesses the\ncreative talents of its workers, as\nopposed to ideas coming from a\nsingular individual as was the case\nwith Apple, if this is fair to say.\nNot all Google\u2019s attempts at\ninnovationhavebeenasuccessthough,\nin fact, these failings could easily be\nslated as the company\u2019s falling short\nof developing a monopoly. A product\nlike Google+, its social networking\noffering could arguably be classified\nas an over-reach, just as its attempts\nin buying Motorola to have a foothold\nAs soon as I had finished installing\nGhost on a cloud virtual server, my\ngood friend Luke G-B pointed out the\nexistence another awesome blogging/\nCMS platform called WagtailCMS.\nWagtailCMS is a Django-powered\nContent Management System created\nby Torchbox, a web design consultancy\nbased in Oxfordshire. The project\nhomepage also features a case study of\nthe platform in use by our neighbours\nat the Royal College of Art (RCA).\nThe platform is completely Open\nSource, with the source code available\non Github along with a demo website\nand a handy tutorial by Serafeim\nPapastefanos.\nWagtailCMS requires a lot more\nconfiguration and customisation\nthan Ghost in order to be useful. As\nwell needing to define page types\nbefore being able to create an article,\nthe platform also comes without any\npackaged style sheets, in fact you have\ntowritethetemplatesforeachpagetype\nfrom scratch, which means that you can\ncreate a fantastically complicated blog\nwith a lot of planning, but also have the\nchance to customise the application to\nyour needs, once you understand how\nto use the system.\nWhile using the WagtailCMS\nplatform requires a large amount of\nspecialised technological expertise\n(if you don\u2019t even know what Django\nis - apart form an awesome modern\npython-based web framework),\nwith the right frame of mind, and an\nexperienced Web Designer you can\ncreate works of art (have a look at the\nRCA website).\nMeanwhile, for those of you with a\nbit of server-admin know how, or more\ntime than you know what to do with,\nthe Ghost platform is fairly easy to set\nHow to get into Ghostblogging!\nChoosing a platform\nWhy Not Wordpress\nor tumblr?\nseem to be almost Twitter feeds made\npermanent, a few fleeting thoughts and\na large pool of pictures poured into a\ndisjointed list of posts. I am aware that\nDavid Karp, the 27 year old founder\nof Tumblr wished to make a blogging\nsystem with a difference, and he did\nachieve his aim, however I believe that\nit fails to meet the needs of the slightly\nmore serious or mature blogger.\nThe reason why I am such a fan of\nGhost (so far) is its simplicity, clean\ndesign and Open Source nature. Any\nsoul with a $5/mo (USD) server, or a\nkind friend (with a server) can easily\nhost their own personal Ghost blog on\na domain of their choice.\nAlternatively, you can pay $5 a month\nto have your blog hosted by Ghost\nthemselves, which roughly adds up to\n\u00a336 per year.\nThe cost is more than the cost of a\nfree WP blog, but this basic plan does\nboast\n\u201c... premium email support, unlimited\nfeatures, unlimited users, unlimited\nthemes & apps, and support for custom\nto view the blog from outside the host\nserver - which is only useful if you have\na VPN via the server and want to keep\nyour blog private).\nLogging on to http://your-domain-or-ip-address-here:2368/ghost brings\nyou straight to the login page of your\nblog. This allows you to set up a user\nand start blogging!\nThe blog posts are written in\nmarkdown, which is a fairly simple text\nmarkup (oh the irony) language (I\u2019ve\njust learned it) and the writing interface\nis really easy on the eye and simple to\nuse. The blog comes with a standard\ntheme that can be easily customised or\nreplaced with a pre-built theme.\nIn order to get your blog ready for\nthe production environment, the Ghost\nteam suggest using the Nginx web\nserver solution, rather than running\nthe Node.js development web server. I\nam still on the Node.js web server (the\napplication is running in a \u201cscreen\u201d)\nhowever, I have also used the apache\nhttp_proxy module to route all requests\nfor port 80 to port 2368(it took 5\nminutes and Google) which means that\nmy blog now serves as the homepage of\nmy domain.\nFinally, as an extra step, if you\u2019d like to\nreceive emails from the blog, (especially\nif you\u2019d like to be able to reset your\npassword one day), I\u2019d also recommend\nfollowing the instructions to set up\nan email address for the blog to send\nnotices from. Gmail is particularly well\nsupported, so the procedure should be\nsimple.\nTip: Remember to restart the web\nserver application after changing the\nwebsite\u2019s configuration files on the\nserver in order for the new settings to\ncome into effect!\nSo, Congratulations! If you\u2019ve\nfollowed each step in the article (and\nthe linked instructions) you should now\nhave a fully functioning (and slightly\nhipster) blog to amaze your friends, or\nhide your deepest thoughts.\nHow to install Ghost\nin the smartphone industry similarly\nproved futile.\nHowever, although it couldn\u2019t\nestablish a foothold through the\nconventional means of creating a\nsmartphone, its inception of the\nandroid operating system which\nis openly licensed to smartphone\nmakers has made it a major player\nin the industry, as far as operating\nsystem goes, with 76% market share.\nThis can be chalked up as an example\nof innovative problem solving which\nagain marks Google out from the rest\nof its competition.\nReturning to the smartwatch,\nGoogle aren\u2019t the first to conceive\nof the idea of making the wearable\ndevice. Sony as a matter of fact are\nprepping the release of their second\nwatch, while Samsung released its\nown smartwatch, the Samsung Gear,\nlast year. As Ewan Spense of Forbes\nargues, the smartwatch industry\nis still \u201cvirgin territory\u201d, despite\nthese entries, which leaves it open\nto Google\u2019s vision and let\u2019s face it,\nresources, to dominate the industry,\nunless ofcourse, Apple has something\nto say about it.\nTime To Start Blogging\nJoseph Letts\nFelix Editor\nGoogle: Now the ultimate innovators?\nTola Makanjuola\nTechnology Writer\n\n"

The third\nIron Man started things off in a typically Shane Black fashion of quips and\naction, the second Thor trod a darker\npath while beginning to introduce the\nelements that will come together in an\ninevitably glorious fashion for Guardians of the Galaxy and Age of Ultron,\nand now it\u2019s the turn of the second\nCaptain America film to grace the\nscreen. The first outing for everyone\u2019s\nfavourite star-spangled superhero was\nan exercise in making an adequate\naction film elevated by incredible\nperformances and pitch-perfect char-acterisation, all of which made the appointment of the Russo brothers as directors an interesting choice. Famous\nfor their TV work on comedies such as\nArrested Development (which, if you\nhaven\u2019t already, you should definitely\nbinge-watch on Netflix), but new to\nthe field of action does not instantly\nscream \u2018classic film in the making\u2019 for\na superhero flick.\nBut, as with almost everything in\nthe realm of superhero films (with a\nfew notable *cough* Green Lantern\n*cough* exceptions), any naysayers\nhave been silenced in spectacular\nfashion. Because the Russo brothers \u2013\nfor want of a neater, more polite term\n\u2013 absolutely nailed it. All of it. Although having said that, the title could\nperhaps be considered somewhat of\na misnomer \u2013 the original storyline\nof the Winter Soldier (part of Ed Brubaker\u2019s fantastic run in the comics) is\nmostly passed over here for the sake\nof convenience, and the eponymous\nsoldier of a seasonal variety barely\nmakes an appearance (although when\nhe does, it\u2019s fantastic).\nIt\u2019s not really a criticism as such,\nmore a vague sense that Marvel re-ally, really wanted to use that title\ndespite the film being so much more.\nIt\u2019s equal parts 70s-style conspiracy\nthriller (helped greatly by a neat turn\nfrom Robert Redford as S.H.I.E.L.D.\nSecretary Alexander Pierce), buddy\ncomedy starring Chris Evans\u2019 Captain America and Scarlett Johansson\u2019s\nBlack Widow (the call for a solo film\nfor Black Widow, strong as it was, just\ngot completely impossible to ignore),\nand a balls-to-the-wall action film.\nGenre-hopping as it pleases, Markus\nand McFeely\u2019s screenplay combined\nwith the Russo\u2019s fantastic direction\n(and wonderfully snappy editing that\nkeeps up the pace) creates what might\nSubtitled Berandal in the US (much\nlike the original was subtitled Redemption), The Raid 2 picks up\n(chronologically-speaking) exactly\nwhere the original left off, with rookie\ncop Rama having survived the brutal tower block that claimed the lives\nof (almost) all of his squad. There\u2019s a\nfew, brief moments of calm exposition\n(which are still punctuated by even\nbriefer outbursts of violence, summing up The Raid 2 in microcosm),\nand then the expansive, multi-year\nplot explodes into being.\nThis is a far trickier, far larger, far\nmore complex beast than the straightforward (in a good way) original.\nSpanning multiple years and (in contrast to that single tower block) multiple environments, this feels like the\nstory director Gareth Evans has been\nwaiting to tell, and the incredible (and\ndeserved) success of the first film has\njust given him the platform he needs.\nRiddled with faction rivalries and dou-ble-crossings, exploring the brutalities\nand complexities of power inside prison and outside of it, it\u2019s a true epic that\nmakes maximum use of its two-and-a-half hour running time.\nObviously, such dedication to story\nrequires more dialogue-heavy scenes\nthan the original premise of \u2018get to the\ntop of this tower\u2019, but it\u2019s testament to\nEvans\u2019 skill with his own script (and\nwith editing) that these moments never slow the film down. Always laced\nwith myriad undertones, often with\nthe threat of sudden violence simmering gently beneath every line, there\u2019s\ntension in every scene, and the whole\nshebang hurtles along at a break-neck\n(sometimes literally) pace.\nWhile this dedication to the story\n(and the rapidity of the plot\u2019s pro-gression) is ultimately what makes\nThe Raid 2 so compelling, it\u2019s probably not the reason why so many fans\nCaptain America:\nThe Winter Soldier\nDirectors: Anthony Russo, Joe Russo\nWriters: Christopher Markus,\nStephen McFeely, Ed Brubaker\nStarring: Chris Evans, Scarlett\nJohansson, Samuel L.

Age of Ultron just\ngot even more exciting.\nBut stepping aside from the superb\nplot and the brilliant, vast-improve-ment-over-the-original action, once\nagain it\u2019s the characters that make\nthis Captain America film brilliant.\nCap\u2019s status as a man-out-of-time is\nbrought to the fore again, as he attempts to make sense of all the years\nhe\u2019s lost since crashing that plane (al-though his experience with Stark et\nal on the Helicarrier seems to have\nimbued him with a new capacity for\nquips), all while juggling the fact that\nthe modern world isn\u2019t quite as black-and-white morally as the one he left,\nembodied to differing degrees by Nick\nFury and Black Widow. Throw in fellow vet Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and his eventual appearance as the\nFalcon and Sebastian Stan\u2019s Winter\nSoldier (plus a few cameos from the\nMCU/the previous film in particular),\nand it\u2019s a bundle of well-written, well-handled characters that feel fantastically real. They are the ones that make\nthis the best solo film in the MCU so\nfar. And they might be the ones who\nmake it the best solo film in the MCU\never.\nThe Raid 2\nDirector: Gareth Evans\nWriter: Gareth Evans\nStarring: Iko Uwais, Yayan Ruhian,\nArifin Putra, Julie Estelle\nRuntime: 150 minutes\nCertification: 18\nof the original will want to watch\nit. The ultra-violence is back, and if\nanything it\u2019s even more extreme this\ntime around. Provoking groans from\nthe audience, and more frequently\nexpletive-laden outbursts of shock,\nThe Raid 2 earns every inch of its 18\ncertificate, and then some. It\u2019s gorgeously filmed \u2013 a veritably beautiful,\nbloody ballet of death and pain that\ncomprises what might just be some of\nthe best action scenes to ever appear\non a cinema screen. It is, quite frankly,\nphenomenal.\nWhat could be fairly by-the-num-bers action scenes (there\u2019s plenty of\nthe traditional beats of the genre, including a pulse-pounding car chase)\nare elevated to something more, both\nby the sheer quantity of unflinching\ngore (the camera almost never cuts\naway from breaking bones and bleeding wounds, displaying every injury as\nit happens regardless of how horrific)\nand by the impeccable choreography\nand camerawork. Credit must go to\neveryone involved \u2013 the actors, the\nstuntmen, the choreographers, the\ndirector, the cameramen, absolutely\neveryone.\nIt\u2019s not perfect \u2013 not quite (the runtime is on the borderline of outstaying\nits welcome, and some of the char-acterisation is a little lacking beyond\nthe required stereotypes) \u2013 this really\nis something special. Faultless acting,\npeerless action, stunning choreography \u2013 it all blurs together to make\nwhat might just be the greatest action\nfilm of all time. It\u2019s certainly one of the\ngreats.\n\n"

Packed with neat\nsocio-political commentary in a dystopian landscape that also manages to\naddress teenage issues of fitting in and\nfinding where you belong in life \u2013 on\npaper it\u2019s perfect. Add in star names\nsuch as Shailene Woodley (who is rapidly promising to steal Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s crown as the hottest young\nactress in Hollywood, if her break-out\nperformance in The Descendants and\nfuture appearance as the star of The\nFault in Our Stars is anything to go by)\nas the heroine, and the likes of Miles\nTeller, Kate Winslet and Ansel Elgort\n(starring opposite Woodley in The\nFault in Our Stars) as support, and on\nMuppets Most Wanted\u2019s opening\nsong, \u201cWe\u2019re Doing a Sequel\u201d successfully nails almost every criticism that\ncould be thrown at it from a \u201cugh, the\nsequel\u2019s not as good as the original\u201d\npoint of view (even if \u2013 as it points out\n\u2013 the \u201coriginal\u201d in question isn\u2019t even\nthe actual \u201coriginal\u201d Muppet movie)\nwhich makes reviewing it slightly dif-ficult. Not impossible, mind. It\u2019s just\nthat the Muppets have \u2013 in their traditionally self-aware (and gloriously\ncharming) way \u2013 managed to successfully knock out most of the bad points\nof the film. It\u2019s not as heart-warming\nas the original (at times it gets the\nclosest to being borderline nasty that\nthe Muppets have been, before quickly finding its feet again), the songs\naren\u2019t as memorable (\u201cWe\u2019re Doing a\nSequel\u201d is easily the best), and the plot\nis inherently more contrived to justify\nmaking the sequel bigger and better.\nAnd almost none of that matters.\nThe absurdities of the plot are ripped\napart with grace within the opening number alone (yeah, a lot seems\nto hinge on that song, including this\nreview), and while the songs aren\u2019t\nas good they remain one of the best\nthings about the film, helping to drive\nthe whole thing forwards when the\nplot threatens to sag (which it does \u2013\nDivergent\nDirector: Neil Burger\nWriters: Evan Daugherty, Vanessa\nTaylor, Veronica Roth (novel)\nStarring: Shailene Woodley, Theo\nJames, Kate Winslet\nRuntime: 139 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nMuppets Most\nWanted\nDirector: James Bobin\nWriters: James Bobin, Nicholas\nStoller\nStarring: Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey,\nTy Burrell, Steven Whitmire, Eric\nJacobson, Dave Goelz, Bill Barretta,\nDavid Rudman\nRuntime: 107 minutes\nCertification: U\ndisappointingly often).\nThere are a few issues unrelated to\nthe nature of sequel-itis, most notably the increased number of times the\nMuppets are seen full-bodied, with\nno strings or puppeteers in sight. The\nMuppets are technically puppets, but\nthey\u2019re so full of life that it\u2019s almost\nimpossible not to treat them as real.\nWhich should, in theory, validate\nthe idea of seeing them move independently via the medium of CGI,\nbut it just doesn\u2019t. If anything, seeing\nConstantine the frog leap and jump\naround (in multiple scenes) threatens\nto kill the illusion. It probably doesn\u2019t\nhelp that the CGI is a bit iffy and obviously fake.\nThe idea of the Muppets being \u2018real\u2019\nbrings us neatly on to the question\nof the cast, and the standard Muppet\ntrend of celebrity cameos, often in\nthe weirdest of places. The main non-Muppet cast are all sound \u2013 Ty Burrell\nprobably wins here, having a whale of\na time lampooning European (mostly\nFrench) stereotypes, while Tina Fey\nmanages to imbue her admittedly\nweaker material and sub-plot with\nheart and comedy. The cameos range\nfrom hilarious to shoe-horned in, but\neven then it\u2019s forgivable as part of the\ngeneral Muppets heritage.\nUltimately, it might be fair to say\nthat Muppets Most Wanted relies\nheavily on the goodwill of the fact this\nis another Muppet movie to help you\noverlook its flaws. But to just dismiss\nit like that would be unfair \u2013 this is a\ndeserving entry into the series, and\nit\u2019s a lot better than some of the previous entries, as well as other family-friendly fare currently floating around\nin cinemas (Escape from Planet Earth,\nI\u2019m looking at you). Throw in the fantastic Monsters Uni short that plays\nbefore the film (one of the advantages\nof Disney owning the Muppets, I sup-pose), and it\u2019s worthy of the price of\nadmission, not just the Muppet name.\nscreen it\u2019s pretty promising too.\nSo, perhaps inevitably, Divergent\ndoesn\u2019t quite live up to that promise.\nTo use that as a reason to completely\nslam the film is a touch unfair \u2013 after\nall, The Hunger Games is an incredibly\nhigh standard to try and reach, and\njust because the cast is good doesn\u2019t\nmean their characters are (examples\nad nauseam). And in its defence, Divergent is a completely serviceable\nfilm. It just never really rises above\nthat \u201cserviceable\u201d, and in a post-Catch-ing Fire world, anything beyond \u2018great\u2019\nis going to look disappointing.\nFirst: the good. Woodley (as you\u2019d\nexpect) completely owns her role as\nTris, the eponymously \u2018Divergent\u2019\nheroine (there\u2019s some helpfully clunky\nvoice-over at the opening of the film\nto explain how the city is split up into\nvarious factions and how said factions\ndetermine your role in life and so on\nand so forth), making the most of a\nrole that gives her the most emotional\nrange allowed to anyone in the film.\nThe plot machinations are reasonably simplistic \u2013 this is revolution-by-numbers \u2013 but the story works on a\nfundamental level, continually driving\nforwards with the occasional revelation or (decent) action scene. The majority of the cast are at least functional\nin their roles, although their counterparts in The Hunger Games series still\nwin out in elevating their characters\nabove their writing (Donald Sutherland\u2019s President Snow compared to\nKate Winslet\u2019s Jeanine Matthews is\nperhaps the most notable example\nof this \u2013 Winslet does good evil ma-nipulator, but Sutherland is downright\nscary), and the aesthetics (while predominantly the classic browns, greys\nand blacks \u2013 hardly an entry for \u2018most\ninventive colour scheme\u2019) mostly\nwork, with a few flashes of inspiration.\nUnfortunately for Divergent, though,\nthere\u2019s not a huge amount of positivity\nleft to throw at it. It was always going\nto suffer from comparisons to a film\nseries it can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s trying to emulate, and although their heroines can go toe-to-toe in the acting\nstakes, and both have important messages to share, Tris inescapably feels\nlike Katniss mark two. The dialogue is\noften painfully on-the-nose (although\npoints must be given for not adopting the classic tactic of forgetting\nabout the voiceover come the film\u2019s\nend), and the occasional dips into CGI\nsometimes feel a little too glossy \u2013 Divergent\u2019s dystopia feels like it could\nuse some more grit at times, even inside its intended 12A bracket (proof if\nyou want it \u2013 The Hunger Games was\ngoing to be a 15 until Lionsgate opted\nto censor a few shots).\nIn the end, Divergent never really\nfeels like it elevates itself above \u2018okay\u2019.\nIt\u2019s an entertaining ride, with a decent\nmessage about not being tied down\nby the system, but it doesn\u2019t really lin-ger. However, on a more upbeat note:\nthere\u2019s a lot of promise for future in-stalments. I\u2019m almost looking forward\nto it.\n\n"

    "content": "18 FRIDAY 02 MAY\nEditors: Joe Letts,\nTessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNIGHTLIFE\nBez is running for an MP in the Salford\nconstituency. If there ever was a time\nwhen taking too many pills might\nhave adverse effects, Bez is mounting\na pretty strong case. I\u2019m no hot-shot\nlawyer, barrister, barista or what you\u2019ll\nhave it, but being a 50 year old, albeit\nan accomplished punk dancer, very\nmuch of their face on BBC does not\nlook good. It\u2019s shabby at best. And his\nplatform is abjectly deploring: anti-fracking and then nothing. Not even\nshouting for legalizing \u2018pills\u2019. He must\nhave taken a few too many and forgot\nabout them, he was shouting for the\ntwo back then, wearing a tank top to\nmatch, back when he was in Happy\nMondays.\nIf I have learned anything as a nonconformist medical student, is that\npeople, the public in general, are\npretty forgiving. I recall when last year\nI wanted to get out of a stupid Clinical\nCommunications exam, I lied about\ngetting a girl pregnant. She was a great\nsport \u2013 she even came to the meeting\nwith me and lied with style and grace.\nReputation\u2019s so 90s and overrated.\nMaybe there is still a chance for Bez\nto grace Westminster with his manic\ndance aerobics. Reputation does\nproceed him. I hope it will reach the\nvoters.\nThe reason I am bringing up Bez is\nbecause that was the news I woke up to\nwhen I finished a fantastically fabulous\nnight at Brixton Academy fuelled by\nthe said \u2018pills\u2019. Unequivocally, it was\nthe Four Tet all-nighter. An all-night\ndelight.\nEver since Despacio, I have regained\nthe modus operandi of a cool raver. I\nbehaved like a buzzing \u2018absztyfikant\u2019,\namplifying everything and anything.\nFactory Records says that when\nyou are presented with a fact and a\nlegend, always print the legend. So\nthe night started when I and Principal\nGoodvibes made our journey down\nto Earl\u2019s Court tube station, to pick a\ngroup of budding ravers\u2026\nThe group consisted of Rishi, who\nsurpassed and solidified the legendary\nstatusofhisshirt,andOli,whodecided\nto defy Willow Smith, and rock her\nhair into a crafted bun, as opposed\nto \u2018rocking it back and forth\u2019. But this\ngroup was an ensemble, a la Siouxie\nand the Banshees (Yes, Oli, you can be\nSiouxie amongst these Banshees. And\nthat is not because you were the only\ngal. Yes, it is because you were the only\ngal): we were joined by Rishi\u2019s friends,\nlocal Greenwich-ians, who in the\npast hailed from an all-boys grammar\nschool, something I know a thing or\ntwo about. Thank Krishna, my parents\naligned their whole lives and careers\nto be in the \u2018right\u2019 catchment area.\nAfter all, you are always right if you\nare in the \u2018right\u2019 catchment area. Or\nConservative \u2013 ha\u2026ha...\nThe initial sighting was awkwardly\npleasant, and that was squarely down\nto me and Principal. For the lack of\nbetter words, we looked like Class-A\npricks. Principal was flaunting,\nspinning around in a gold night-coat akin to an inside joke by Mr\nGoldfinger, with the Communards red\nshirt, Ray Bans and boat shoes. I chose\nto woo the crowd with the infamous\norange shorts, coupled by blue shirt\nand grey blazer combo (no elbow\npads, I ain\u2019t a prick) and orange-blue\nNew Balance sneakers, just to take the\n\u2018edge\u2019 of it all. Let\u2019s just say, to people\nwho did not know us, we did look\nlike Class-A pricks. But hey, we are\nmavericks and we relish in surprising\npeople and breaking class boundaries.\nWe are revolutionaries from within,\nputting up a brave fight in the name\nof all that is meritocratic and bisexual.\nBlur those gender lines, blur them\nRobin Thicke!\nAnd we did pull a \u2018maverick\u2019 on\neveryone. Maybe not John McCainstyle \u2013 he is a self-affirmed maverick,\nbut it was close. One day we do plan\nto stage our Operation Desert Storm\n2.0 in Afghanistan or some other\nAllah-forsaken place, because we\nARE mavericks. All about that later.\nBecause for now, we have to replenish\nthe raver\u2019s kit: orange American Spirit\ncigarettes (they are so choice; if you\nhave the means, I highly recommend\npicking one up, Ferris Bueller told me\nso), Coronas on lock and load, chilled\nChablis, and of course, the gear that\nawaited us in our abode. So we made\nour way down to the basement flat for\nthe pre-drinking sesh.\nIt was a large one: 15 people in\nattendance, and with the forecast\nimplying an imminent arrival of\n20-odd people from Kait\u2019s halls\n(unfortunately and fortunately, that\ndid not precipitate); we were in for a\nbanger. After courteous woos from\nthe guests on the topic of our house,\nwe coalesced around the \u2018grotto\u2019,\nstarting to mingle. Brewskis a-poppin\u2019,\ncigarattes a-littin\u2019 - we socialised. In\nfact, it was surprisingly spontaneous.\nYou see, there were some boundaries\nto break. If the logical mind prevails,\nthink about it: Rishi and Oli only know\nme from Despacio, that\u2019s it. And then\nthis group of unacquainted 15-odd\nBanshees descends into someone\u2019s\nEarl\u2019s Court basement, in the presence\nof two promoters/friendly dealers\nfrom Cardiff (special import, thanks\nto mutual friendship with Mr Charles\nRotknap).\nPrincipal was manning the decks,\nspinning large ones after big ones, to a\nkeen aplomb of the guests. MacBook\nAir was his weapon of choice \u2013 not\nbecause he is a laptop DJ, never,\nit was just simpler on a Saturday\nnight. Playing the role of a grand\nhost ain\u2019t easy but his collection of\nrecords was perused by the guests\nand appropriately complemented. I\nrekindled the social fire with Rishi\nand Oli \u2013 they were great to chat to,\nproviding a fluid exchange of ideas,\nhypothesium, tractorum (Latin,\nplural for hypothesis and tractus,\nboth genitive. Grammar school, eh?)\netc. Pray tell us, what happened next?\nWell, Oli decided to take a selfie of\nus and send it to her Swedish friend,\nwho said I was hot. Thanks lady, but\nI am damaged goods. Take me to the\nstore and get a refund, better store\ncredit \u2013 Christmas presents sorted,\nI do bring the cheer, don\u2019t I? I am\nan apprehensive opponent of the\nwhole selfie-culture. Any reasons?\nOnly healthy fish go against the flow,\naccording to a famous Communist\nParty leader. Since I am a healthy fish,\ngo figure. But in this case, it was a\nwell-timed selfie because it fulfilled its\ndesign brief: boost my self-esteem in\nan egotistical manner.\n11pm struck, and we struck the\nstreets. The tube. I felt like I was in\nthe midst of Enoch Powell\u2019s \u2018Rivers of\nBlood\u2019 speech: I was basically lashed\nand receptive to fascist/non-fascist\npropaganda. My mind was coming\nup with the most amusing stories,\nbeing reacquainted with the concept\nof Willy Brandt\u2019s \u2018Kneefall\u2019 thanks\nto Oli was an epiphany, a revelation.\nSomething on par with the Three\nSecrets of Fatima. Little did we know,\nwe would have our \u2018Kneefall\u2019 to the\ngods of techno when Four Tet dropped\nit. And oh, he dropped it.\nWe were waiting in the massive\nqueue. The clock struck \u2018Mandy\no\u2019clock\u2019. We dropped the bombs: we\nare talking some premium, pristine\nstuff. 1/6th gram of Sassafras will get\nyou fucked, but very gallantly and\never so mellow. It is sassy from the\nbottom up, unbelievable in its every\nconceivable reincarnation. Nirvana,\nbaby, Nirvana. Shame Kurt Cobain\nnever had tried it, I am sure he would\nbe still around us today, had it not\nbeen for that (or Courtney Love,\nyou murderous-NWO-SOPA-KGB-operational-conspiracy-aparatchik!).\nIn the said line, all queued in a\nvery British manner, very anti-LCD\nSoundystem-esque. It was swift,\nmanned by friendly \u2018safety officers\u2019\nand an adorkable sniffer Cocker\nSpaniel (I just wanted to put you on\nthe notice, that I notice, that you did\nnot notice that we fooled you dawg.\nX-Zibit, nwot nwot, we out). We were\njoined by Kait\u2019s pack: I had certain\nreservations about them, and it proved\nat the first sighting: they were rocking\nbindis, lack of decorum to say the least\n(I feel the same about people who rock\nH&M Native American motifs \u2013 basic\nlack of decorum). It also turned out\nthat the reason these peeps did not\nmake it to our pre-drinks was because\nthey were too lazy, despite Earl\u2019s Court\nbeing kinda on the way to Brixton for\nthem. And worst, Kait really wanted\nto come, but her friends denied the\nrequest - she cried because of that. It\nwas her birthday. Happy Birthday!\nFinally, we made the grand entry.\nFront middle stage, we danced like\nmaniacs, we behaved like maniacs,\nconforming and not conforming.\nI formed a dancing quartet with\nRishi, Oli and Principal \u2013 this was\nnot a square formation, but circular\nand primal. Then, the loving lady\ncalled Mandy bequeathed us with\nhappiness and she rocked our world.\nI felt ecstatic, in heaven, as if I have\nruptured my spleen. It was a Joy\nRapture. Words can\u2019t contain them\nfeels, the wavy orchestra of the\ndepleted serotonin, defying Principal\u2019s\nalter nickname of Mr Dopamine-less.\nWe hugged, we kissed, we connected.\nTry this once and you will thank me:\nactually, having shared the goods with\nall the Banshees, all of them were star-struck, in awe \u2013 that\u2019s how I proved\nmy status of a maverick. You buds\nwere awesome, I hope to rave with\nyou one day.\nOf course, the associated dangers\nare well-known: it is neurotoxic so\ndo it very sporadically and one can\nbecome a sexual \u2018animaux\u2019. Some\npeople were getting ever so too frisky,\nMatt. Respect the lady or Charles\n(it\u2019s the new gtfo, the polite version \u2013\nthat\u2019s Mr Charles Rotknap for ya. He\nknows how to stick it to ya, but he is\na gentle man about it). Water under\nbridge though, boys will be boys,\nlove is a battlefield, [put in commonly\ngeneric clich\u00e9s, I am making this piece\ninteractive \u2013 enjoy]. Top tip of the\nday \u2013 thanks to Kim Wilde and Nik\nKershaw \u2013 at the post-load, take some\nsupplements to reduce neurotoxicity:\nnamely Vitamin C, 5-HTP (serotonin\nprecursor), Vitamin E and others. Do\nyour own research. Nobody does the\nree-search as Tom Cruise does his\nree-search.\nMusic was spectacular, timed and\nrave-y. Four Tet is the man of his own\ngenre, Ben UFO and Daphne delivered\nthe goodie goodies. Our dance moves\nwere contemporary, unabashed, and\nspiritually on the ball \u2013 Oli was the\nbest raver, she moves oh, she moves.\nRishi was a close second, mainly props\nfor him being the last at getting his\nfive second with Mandy, yet he was\nwith us. Till the end.\nIt was a perfect night. But\npremonition being premonition \u2013\nthe Ch\u2019i gets fucked by the yuppies\nin Brixton; let us raise the barricades\nand squat! Oli lost her wallet. The\ngods of Olympus were smiling upon\nus because promptly, she found it\nat the Lost and Found Department.\nThe benefits don\u2019t stop there (like Ian\nDuncan Smith would want to, that 53\nquid mark can be bitching) \u2013 she had a\nspare bomb in the wallet that coasted\nus to the very end of the night.\n6am, we left \u2013 the dawn was upon\nus, sprinkling the kind rays of Suns,\nas if we were some premium Krispy\nKremes, getting decorated. But\nthe coldness of the morning dew\nleft us struggling, especially this\nobstructionist in shorts. But friends\ncame to the rescue: Rishi and Oli\ngave me a heartfelt leg-warming sesh\n\u2013 it was extra warm because it was\nheartfelt. Oh, pull yourself together,\ndon\u2019t sound like a GQ writer!\nWe said the not ambivalent hollers,\nand the dynamic quartet got into\na taxi \u2018nach zu\u2019 house. I\u2019ve let the\ndynamic duo crash in my bed, whilst\nI took up the temporary residence,\ntechnically a squat, in Principal\u2019s bed.\nI lend a t-shirt to Oli to substitute the\nnon-existent PJs, first time I did so for\na girl. This comedic moment was only\ntopped by the choice of the T: an ironic\nAmerican Apparel gear, engraved with\na phrase \u2018dirty minds think alike\u2019 and\na graphic of cerebral hemispheres. All\nis well that ends well, it felt like the\nChevy Chase-esque antics. We hit the\nsnooze.\nTime to sum it up, confess the\nnot confessable, admit the non-admitting, draw an end to it all: this\nwas one of the best nights. Everyone\nwas blasting, music intense, lighting\nreminiscent of a starry night, just\nlike in Countryfile, company sweeter\nthan a dab of ambrosia, dancing sans-inhibitions, chemistry befitting a PhD\nthesis, fashion on the latter part of an\nexponential curve (is that a decent\nmaths reference, Rishi? Would it get\ninto a Simpsons gag?). What could\nwe want? We were young. We are\nyoung. Last night it felt like forever,\nthat fleeting moment in the busy\nlives of yuppies-to-be. \u2018Only meek get\npinched. The bold survive\u2019. Despacio\nwas better musically, Brixton better\nsocially. I pledge all that is holy and\nunholy, this combination would be,\ncould be and is revolutionary.\nIt is an all-night delight.\nFelix in does not condone drug use.\n- Ed\nAll Night Delight\nThat\u2019s the prize, multiply it by 3.33\n(recurring).

    "content": "24 FRIDAY 02 MAY\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHow good is The Good Wife?\nThe Good Wife\nPrimetime television shows (i.e. the\nones that are not on cable channels\nand therefore lack sex, nudity, violence\nand swearing) are often unfairly overlooked when it comes to providing an\nanswer for that question \u201cwhat\u2019s your\nfavourite tv show\u201d? Game of Thrones,\nBreaking Bad, The Wire, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Mad Men, even\nBattlestar Galactica are all very worthy mentions, but an equally strong\ncase can be argued for The Good Wife,\nan excellent legal drama currently\nin its fifth season, that is watched by\nplenty of people, but not by those in\nthe \u201cright\u201d key demographic of ages\n18-49, which is a shame.\nIt is not uncommon for serious\nshows to lose its steam and dramatic\nmomentum when it has been carrying on for as long as this show has, but\nThe Good Wife is a completely different beast of a compelling drama, in\nthat it consistently manages to outdo\nthe extraordinarily high bar set by its\nprevious season.\nEverything kicks off in its first season with an all-too-familiar backdrop\nof a seedy sex scandal. Alicia Florrick\u2019s\n(Julianna Margulies) life is turned into\na media frenzy as her husband Peter,\nthe state\u2019s attorney of Cook County,\nIllinois, is faced with accusations of\nmultiple accounts of indecent conduct\ninvolving prostitutes, drugs and suspicious financial dealings. With her hus-band, the previous sole breadwinner,\nbehind bars, it\u2019s time for Alicia to dust\noff her law degree and jump back into\nthe courtroom, something she hasn\u2019t\ndone in at least fifteen years.\nThere are challenges ahead: she\nis having to start from all the way at\nthe bottom as a first-year associate,\nshe faces competition to keep on to\nher position in the form of Cary Agos\n(Matt Czuchry), the fresh-out-of-law-school, keen, eager type, she has two\nchildren of her own to raise, and of\ncourse, there is that scandal everyone keeps talking about. But thanks\nto her old friend Will Gardner (Josh\nCharles), her role at Stern, Lockhart\n& Gardner provides a way for her to\nmake ends meet.\nEach episode deals with a different legal case, just like any other legal\ndramas out there. But there are reasons why this familiar formula works.\nFirstly, the cases are all fascinating.\nWithout exception. Even the ones that\nmay seem straightforward to begin\nwith are deliberately designed that\nway, to make room for complications\nthat arise. The cases are up to date\nand relevant, with writers clearly getting direct inspiration from current\nevents, often adapting cases that are\ndominating the headlines. The Good\nWife is also known for being an incredibly tech-savvy show, constantly\nshowing how the rapid advancement\nof technology can both help and hurt\nthe practising of law. They have their\nown version of Google (called Chumhum here) in its universe, an important client that frequently gets into\ntrouble. With irreplaceable assistance\nfrom Kalinda Sharma, the law firm\u2019s\nbest investigator, our team of skilled\nlawyers have to deal with some of the\ntoughest, most nail-bitingly tense cases that are neatly packed in for each\n40-minute episode.\nIndividual cases aren\u2019t the only aspect that makes the show unique.\nThere are also the equally important\nseason-long story arcs that take place.\nWhether it\u2019s petty office politics that\nends up exploding to an all-out civil\nwar, or important political campaigns\nthat need legal attention, or even a\nsimple love triangle that toys with\nour heroine\u2019s emotions, these added\njuicy plot lines all weave together to\ngive one gripping overall season that\ncovers so many aspects of the show\u2019s\ncharacters.\nNo important individual is dis-carded. Of course, the show revolves\naround Alicia, hence the title, but\nequally crucial are those around her.\nWhen it comes to the performances,\nit would difficult to find an ensemble\nthat matches the finely tuned, incredibly well gelled cast of The Good Wife.\nAt the show\u2019s centre is Margulies, in\nher Golden Globe, Emmy and SAGwinning role. She is as effective showing weaknesses and vulnerability as\nshe is when she\u2019s on top legal form,\nrelentlessly arguing for her clients\u2019 tri-umph, when she is, in her own words,\n\u201ckicking butt\u201d. Her development is\na fascinating one, from a betrayed\nwife and mother, rising to an assured\nlawyer status in the over-subscribed,\ncompetitive and morally ambiguous\nlegal world.\nAlicia is never keen to bend or break\nthe rules. But her friend/boss Will\nGardner and his firm partner Diane\nLockhart (Christine Baranski) think a\nlittle differently. Will and Diane make\nan extraordinary team, fighting for\ntheir clients and firm with ambition\nand a little more cynical view of the\nworld, since they\u2019ve been at this a lot\nlonger than Alicia has. Even during\none of their bitter feuds, usually stemming from one of them trying to push\nthe other one out, the two are a marvel\nto watch.\nSexual tension makes up a significant portion of the many season-long\nstory arcs, as things get steamy for\npretty much everyone involved. Kickass investigator Kalinda Sharma\u2019s\nbicurious tendencies are what stand\nout the most, but despite this she\u2019s\nnot someone defined solely by her\nsexuality. She\u2019s incredible at her job,\nand she doesn\u2019t take any abuse from\nanyone. Panjabi\u2019s Emmy-winning performance has many scene-stealing\nmoments, and even in the show\u2019s fifth\nseason, she is still a bit of a mystery,\nas she keeps a lot of herself closed off\nfrom the rest of the world. There\u2019s a\nwill-they-won\u2019t-they romantic flame\nbrewing between Kalinda and Cary,\nwho is quite relentless but ultimately\nchilidishly adorable in his pursuit, although what will happen of them remains to be seen.\nOf course, aside from the challenges\nat the office, Alicia has the difficult\ntask of taking care of her two teenage children Zach (Graham Phillips)\nand Grace (Makenzie Vega), as well as\noften having to deal with her mother-in-law Jackie (Mary Beth Peil) who\ncan be quite a handful to say the least.\nSpeaking of family, the show\u2019s mood\nis always brightened up when Alicia\u2019s\nrelatives show up: including her gay\nbrother Owen (Dallas Roberts), and\nher mother Veronica (Stockard Channing), both of whom not only act as\ncomic relief, but also in crucial plot\ndevelopments, those that affect Alicia\nsignificantly.\nThat delicate balance between serious drama and smart humour is\nsomething that shows the writers\nworking behind the scenes are doing\nan admirable job. There are no des-perate, completely forced attempts to\nturn this into a comedy show, but the\nlaughs that are generated are through\ncompletely natural, believable acts of\ncharacters\u2019 actions and subsequent\nreactions, some outrageous developments akin to what we see in the real\nworld, realistic scenarios are cleverly\nmanipulated to give us the deliberate,\nwell-placed laughs.\nThere are no clear-cut good and bad\ncharacters; the writing is too smart\nfor that. The firm defends drug deal-ers, suspected killers, pharmaceutical\ncompanies etc, and with each case\nbrings with it a sensitive, delicate mat-ter. And because the lawyers\u2019 number\none priority is to their paying clients,\nthis means sometimes, having a conscience is a hindrance to the job.\nEven Peter Florrick (Chris Noth),\nwho puts Alicia in jeopardy due to his\ninability to keep his trousers zipped,\nhas several moments of redemption,\nand is a classic example of how someone who you should not really like,\nbegins to grow on you. Eli Gold (Alan\nCumming), a political strategist and\ncrisis manager, working closely with\nthe Florrick family, probably gets the\nmost laughs, thanks to his very serious approach to his work even though\nthose around him sometimes struggle\nto keep up. David Lee (Zach Grenier)\nStern, Lockhart & Gardner\u2019s family\nlawyer, is a mighty conniving creature,\nwho will do anything to get his client a\nbigger settlement from his/her soon-to-be-ex-spouse. Grenier is always a\ndelight to watch, and his entertaining\nantics are downright hilarious.\nAnother way the show scores points\nis through its use of excellent guest\nstars, and the way everyone keeps\ncoming back for more. So many talented individuals drop by to play cli-ents, opposing counsel, political ene-mies, judges, among many other roles\nnecessary to be filled. Michael J. Fox,\nRita Wilson, Mamie Gummer, America Ferrera, Kurt Fuller, Denis O\u2019Hare,\nF. Murray Abraham, Matthew Perry,\nJane Alexander, Martha Plimpton,\nCarrie Preston, Dylan Baker, Anika\nNoni Rose, Scott Porter, Gary Cole,\nMelissa George, Anna Camp, Parker\nPosey, Maura Tierney are all a part of\nthis amazing guest-starring ensemble\nwho have left an unforgettable mark,\nand there are plenty more who have\nnot been named, but without whom\nthe show would have been the same.\nThere are shocks and surprises\nalong the way, the biggest one arguably seen in the show\u2019s incredibly bold\nfifth season, a gamble that is currently\npaying off given the new sides to every\ncharacter the show is exploring, plus\nintroducing Finn Polmar (Matthew\nGoode), a prosecutor who should be\nsticking around for a while.\nThe Good Wife is a show difficult to\nfault, and thank god this was renewed\nfor a sixth season. Keep going Mrs\nFlorrick, we\u2019re all rooting for you.\n\n"

I mean what is better\nthan getting paid a decent wage just\nto stand there, literally sometimes for\nhours. Some of the longer labs can be\nup to three, not a bad little break from\nbanging your head against the wall of\n\u201cresearch\u201d. I mean after a few years at\nImperial a bit of boredom is welcome.\nBut out of the corner of my eye\nI could see them, the older PhDs.\nHovering around groups of students\nthat might be stuck (or in fact just\ndiscussing who the power couple of\nthedepartmentis).Ortheywouldpace\nup and down, start sweet talking the\nlecturer or start heckling the students\noutright to make sure the students did\nnot even have an inkling of a question.\nWhat was really noticeable was\nthese veterans never chatted. They\nremained on point, prepared to leap\nto the needs of any student and would\nalways be seen answering a question\nwhen the lecturer walked back into\nthe room.\nThis hit me at the common\ndenominator: the lecturer. As a PhD\nyou have moved a few rungs down\non the apathy level. Not only will\nlecturers now know your name,\nthey might also have met your like\nboyfriend or something. (Even\nsometimes they might know where\nyour parents live and yes, this has\ndisturbed my sleep). But with great\npower\u2026 well a recognisable face \u2026\ncomes great responsibility. I came to\nrealise when a lecturer asked me to\nteach in a class, he/she (probably he)\nwould remember if the students asked\nme things or avoided me at all costs,\nwhich has happened.\nThe main reason for this is that the\nlecturers pay for the pleasure of our\ncompany out of their funds for a class.\nIf they employ too many GTAs they\nwill have over paid for something they\ncould get for less. The first symptom\nof this is a quiet class. This is where\nthe veterans come in to their own.\nThey become indispensable as they\nare the only ones working while all\nthese newbies are standing at the\nfront chatting. They also have known\nthe lecturer longer. They will be the\nfirst for the call backs and the pay\ncheck for next year.\nNow in a quiet room of students\nworking beautifully quietly, I find\nmyself insanely pacing, drumming up\nquestions even the students did not\nthink they needed to ask and being\ntotally icy to my chatty colleagues.\nSo my confession is that you need to\ngive GTAs work to stop this obsessive\nbehaviour. Ask them that question\nhowever stupid you think it is, they\nwill love you for it.\n18.00 l 16 May l Hyde Park\nJOin One Big Thing\nfor a 5km sporting\nchallenge of your choice\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/sports/onebigthing\n5k any way challenge - walking l jogging l running\n\n"

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 02 MAY\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhile you were st\nThe sweeping, captioned opening of\nDarren Aronofsky\u2019s Noah is reminiscent of its cinematic heritage, the Biblical epics of years past, all elegantly\nflowing cursive script and delicately\ncomposed shots, until it promptly\nNoah\nDirector: Darren Aronofsky\nWriters: Darren Aronofsky, Ari\nHandel\nStarring: Russell Crowe, Jennifer\nConnelly, Emma Watson, Ray\nWinstone, Douglas Booth, Logan\nLerman, Anthony Hopkins\nRuntime: 138 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nswoops down to the dark brutality of\nhumanity. It\u2019s a fantastic opening that\nsets the tone wonderfully, leaving a\nsense of ominous foreboding of everything that follows, while also making the statement that this is a Biblical\nepic, yes, but it\u2019s Aronofsky\u2019s Biblical\nepic. It\u2019s his vision.\nAnd what a vision it is \u2013 from Noah\u2019s\n(suitably terrifying) vision of the Earth\nunderwater to the Watchers, the fallen\nangels who lost their wings for simply\ntrying to help, to the breath-taking\nexpanses that make up this world, it\u2019s\nnever anything less than eye-catching.\nThe influences of Paradise Lost can be\nfelt, here and there, (no bad thing, of\ncourse), and the changes in scenery\nare more dramatic than most globe-trotting films \u2013 barren wastelands,\nlush green forests, misty mountains, a\nglobe-spanning flood (obviously) and\ndesert islands, they\u2019re all here and all\nfully realised. Every single element of\nthe art design, the environments, all of\nit, lives up to that \u2018epic\u2019 tag.\nThe imagery is striking, the assault\non the Ark at the mid-point of the\nfilm is break-taking (and I mean that\nliterally \u2013 I only realised I\u2019d been holding my breath for almost the entire\nsequence when I let it all out explosively at the end, and the person sitting next to me gave me a healthy dose\nof a disapproving glare), and the ecological message (which is roughly as\nsubtle as, say, sending a massive flood\nto show how pissed off you are with\neveryone) is a strong one, blended in\nwith a healthy dose of philosophy (this\nis an inherently religious film \u2013 it can\u2019t\nbe anything else, really \u2013 but it still\nmanages to insert some big questions\nabout faith, particularly in the latter\nhalf).\nIt\u2019s fortunate, really, that all this ep-ic-ness is more than matched by the\nacting. If anything, I might go so far as\nto say the acting is the best thing about\nNoah. Crowe is nothing less than perfect as the eponymous Biblical action\nhero, deftly handling the enormous\nvariety of emotions and roles Noah\ngoes through (from said action hero,\nto tyrant, to a broken man, and multiple more besides), while Jennifer Connelly more than matches him, bringing\nthe tears with her impassioned plea\nfor him to spare their future grand-children. Anthony Hopkins continues\nto enjoy himself, taking a role that allows him relatively little screen-time\nbut also all of the (admittedly few)\nlaughs of the film, while Emma Watson and Logan Lerman continue their\nstreak of quality films they\u2019ve both\nworked on (the last being Perks of Being a Wallflower), putting in solid per-formances. The rest of the supporting\ncast is equally strong \u2013 Ray Winstone\nis appropriately hammy as the leader\nof the rest of the human race \u2013 but in\nthe end it really is Crowe\u2019s show. And\nhe absolutely owns it.\nOf course, even the best of acting\ncan out-stay its welcome, and Noah\ndoes just that, rocking in at 138 min-utes. From the earliest scenes there\u2019s\nan inescapable sense of bloat, as the\nfilm follows a slightly jerky rhythm,\naccelerating rapidly towards key mo-ments, slowing down to a sluggish\ncrawl, suddenly picking up again, and\nthen repeating. The ending is power-ful, nailing all the themes of the film,\nbut it comes somewhat too late. If\nyou\u2019re prepared to forgive the bloat,\nand enjoy the story (and at moments,\nit holds you so tightly in its grip you\nbarely even notice the drop in pace),\nit\u2019s an incredibly compelling one. It\u2019s\neven better than the original.\nRio 2\nDirector: Carlos Saldanha\nWriters: Jenny Bicks, Carlos\nSaldanha, Yoni Brenner, Carlos\nKotkin, Don Rhymer\nStarring: (voices) Jesse Eisenberg,\nAnne Hathaway, Jamie Foxx, Bruno\nMars\nRuntime: 101 minutes\nCertification: U\nThe original Rio (I\u2019ve noticed the fact\nI seem to be using \u2018the original\u2019 or\nvariations on that theme a lot of late\n\u2013 probably says something about just\nhow many sequels have been coming\nout this year) was an entertaining-enough blast of colour and samba,\npropped up by decent vocal performances and a show stealing turn from\nFlight of the Conchords\u2019 Jemaine Clement as evil cockatoo Nigel. The sequel\nseems to fairly quickly acknowledge\nits predecessor\u2019s limitations, opting to\ncompletely ignore its title and abandon the city for the wilds of the Amazon (cue a cutesy imitation of the ol\u2019\nIndy-style \u2018travel by map\u2019 (thanks for\nthat one, The Muppets)). A dramatic\nuprooting for the last remaining family of blue macaws on earth, which has\nthe dramatic effect of simply moving the same old by-the-numbers\nfamily-friendly plotting to a different\nenvironment.\nYeah, Rio 2 doesn\u2019t really add anything to the series. It\u2019s not worse than\nthe first one, by any means, but it\ndoesn\u2019t exactly offer many convincing reasons for its existence beyond\nfinancially-motivated studio decisions\n(much like the Ice Age films, I sup-pose). Most of the comedy is squarely\naimed at children \u2013 not a bad thing, I\nhasten to point out, it\u2019s just most big-bucks kids films these days tend to be\nfun for all the family (I mean, just look\nat Toy Story and How to Train Your\nDragon and tell me they\u2019re not fantastic films in their own right) \u2013 and\nwhile cast-wise there\u2019s plenty of big\nnames from the world of cinema and\nmusic (Bruno Mars joins the cast as\na pretty-boy macaw and yes that was\nmeant to be a parrot joke okay), the\nstory doesn\u2019t really allow any of them\nto actually let loose on their roles. It\u2019s\nall very rote stuff, cramming an obvious eco-warrior message into the plot\nand then completely ignoring it in\nthe finale (and besides, Noah did this\nenvironmentally-friendly stuff far, far\nbetter), mixed in with the occasional\nwacky hi-jinks.\nIt\u2019s the hi-jinks that save the film,\nthough, mostly thanks (yet again) to\nNigel the cockatoo. Easily the funniest\ncharacter, his scenes are consistently\nthe highlight of the film (with his audition \u2018sequence\u2019 the stand-out, and the\nonly scene to actually provoke audible\nlaughter from anyone over the age of\nsix in the cinema), and his drive for revenge providing some much-needed\nmomentum to the plot.\nThe visuals are on a par with before\n(pretty, but nothing mind-blowing),\nalthough the change of background\ndoes allow for even more colour than\nbefore, and the music is still ultimately the heart of the film (albeit not its\nbest point by miles), but the lacklustre\nscript lets it all down. With the sheer\nnumber of writers attached to the\nproject (two for story and characters,\nthree more for the screenplay), it\u2019s not\nhard to see why. Rio 2 tries to hit the\nright beats, and mostly succeeds in a\nmundane sort of way. Throw in some\nutterly pointless 3D, and there\u2019s a\nstrong whiff of studio cynicism in the\nair. Good enough for the kids to enjoy,\nand therefore armed with the strong\npossibility of making some money, it\u2019s\na sound calculation. If it does produce\nthe almost inevitable sequel, I only\nhope it doesn\u2019t go the route of the Ice\nAge series. Although I can\u2019t see it going anywhere else.\n\n"

After\nsuch success, there\u2019s always a risk that\nthe creators might sit back and rest\non their laurels, confident that people\nwill watch either way. Thankfully, that\nshows no sign of being the case for the\nseries so far.\nAnother consequence of this could\nbe that the writers decide to take\nmore risks, and evidence of that might\nbe found in the increasingly frequent\ndepartures from the source material\nwe\u2019ve seen. A lot of the choices of the\nwriters to add and rearrange events\nfrom the books make sense, but for\nothers the motivation is less clear. We\nexamine what the series has got right\nand got wrong so far.\nWarning: contains spoilers for all\naired episodes!\nFor anyone who\u2019d read the books,\nthere was only one event early in the\nseries to get truly excited for, and that\nwas the moment we\u2019d been waiting\nfor since series one: Joffrey finally\ngetting what was coming to him. From\nall of the build-up to his wedding to\nMargaery Tyrell, it seemed inevitable\nthat something big was going to\nhappen, even to those who didn\u2019t know\nwhat was coming. As the wedding got\nunderway, it was clear that this wasn\u2019t\ngoing to a joyous occasion for all\nconcerned. After managing to insult\njust about every high-born guest at\nthe wedding with an ill-conceived\nperformance by a troupe of dwarfs,\nthen further humiliating his uncle\nTyrion, the climax came after what felt\nlike hours of tension: Joffrey, purple-faced and choking to death.\nAlthough a victory of sorts to all\nthose who hated Joffrey, his death\nimmediately led to some pretty big\nproblems for Sansa and Tyrion, both\nThe stand-out new character of the\nseries is Oberyn Martell, brilliantly\nplayed by Chilean actor Pedro Pascal.\nMartell is a Dornish prince who goes\nby the nickname of \u2018Red Viper\u2019 and\nwas invited to the capital for the King\u2019s\nwedding, but has other priorities for\nhis visit: getting revenge for the death\nof his sister, Elia, brutually murdered\nby Ser Gregor Clane, presumably\nfollowing orders from Tywin\nLannister. On his quest for revenge,\nhowever, he still spends plenty of time\nhanging out in brothels, where he\u2019s\nan easy customer to please, provided\nnobody starts singing the Lannister\u2019s\ntheme tune, \u2018The Rains of Castamere\u2019.\nHis steamy brothel scenes are also the\nnearest we\u2019ve got to correcting the\nhugely unfair imbalance between the\namount of male and female nudity\nin the series so far (I hear there\u2019s an\nonline petition, just in case you\u2019re\ninterested).\nThe Bad\nDaenarys\u2019 journey to conquer\nWesteros only after paying a visit to\nevery city, town and large-ish hamlet\non the way continues, with very few\nglimpses of the dragon babies (now\ndragon teenagers, one presumes) to\nsustain the viewers\u2019 interest. To be fair,\nthe endless scenes of slave liberation\nare infinitely more exciting than those\nin the book, but it still seems as if the\nMother of Dragons hasn\u2019t really gone\nanywhere except from one desert to\nanother since series two. Also, Daario\nNaharis, the flirtatious sellsword\nwho\u2019s been piquing Dany\u2019s interest,\nhas been recast, and yet still doesn\u2019t\nhave the blue-dyed mustachios and\nthree-pronged beard he\u2019s described as\nhaving in the books.\nAnother place where things seem to\nbe going nowhere is the Wall, where\nJon Snow has returned to his own\nfair share of troubles: namely, being\naccused of betraying the Night\u2019s\nWatch by killing Qhorin Halfhand\nand having inappropriate amounts\nof fun with a wilding lady. In spite\nof being accused of treason, no one\nseems to actually want to lock him up,\nso instead he just reverts back to the\nclassic Jon Snow pasttimes of pouting\nand showing off his swordfighting\nskills.\nAlso being annoying at the wall is\nSam, who, in spite of all his fretting\nabout Gilly, has yet to make a move.\nYou\u2019d reckon her naming her son after\nhim would be enough to convince him\nhe was in with a shot, but instead he\ndecides to send her away from the\nWall to a dubious-looking inn-cum-brothel for her safety, then spends the\nnext two episodes whining about it.\nFinally, Aiden Gillen seems to be\nattempting yet another questionable\naccent, with little to no improvement\nat making anyone actully take\nLittlefinger seriously.\nThe Ugly\nGame of Thrones has taken its fair\nshare of criticism for its frequent and\noften unnecessary scenes of sexual\nviolence, but the third episode of the\nseries, in which Jaime Lannister raped\nhis sister Cersei, was particularly\nreprehensible. It was also a complete\ndeparture from the scene in the\nbooks, in which Jaime and Cersei have\nsex which is, if distasteful (given that\nis happens over their son\u2019s corpse), at\nleast consensual. The series, however,\nsaw fit to change the scene to one in\nwhich Jaime calls Cersei a \u2018hateful\nwoman\u2019 then rapes her as she pleads\nwith him to stop.\nNot only was the scene\nuncomfortable to watch, it also\ncompletely reduced three series of\ncharacter development on Jaime\u2019s part\nto nothing. After seeing him push a\nchild out of a window at the end of\nthe first series, the slow redemption\nof Jaime Lannister has been one of\nthe better-done plotlines of the show,\nfollwing his capture and release by\nCatelyn Stark and his acquaintance of\nBrienne. All of that was undone by the\nrape scene: in particular, the following\nepisodes\u2019s scene where Jaime gives\nBrienne his sword and a coat of\narmour in order for her to fulfil her\nvow to Catelyn fell flat, following his\nbrutal treatment of his sister.\nThe creators of the show appeared\nto have differing interpretations of\nthe scene as well, with the director\nclaiming that the scene \u2018became\nconsensual at the end\u2019 and Nikolaj\nCoster-Waldau, who plays Jaime,\nreplying \u2018Yes, and no,\u2019 when asked\nif he thought the scene was rape. If\nthere was any ambiguity intended in\nthe scene, it didn\u2019t come across in the\nfilming.\nThe threat of rape and sexual\nviolence is fundamental to the setting\nof the book: Westeros is emphasised\ntime and time again to be a pretty\nhorrendous place to live, especially\nfor women. That doesn\u2019t explain or\njustify the insertion of a rape scene\nthat served no plot or character\ndevelopment purposes.\nJaime Lannister: now a rapist, apparently\nIrish? Welsh? Who knows anymore\nNot bad facial hair, but not the right colour\nat the top of the list of people who\nhad reason to kill him (admittedly, a\nvery long list). While Sansa managed\nto escape from King\u2019s Landing before\nbeing apprehended, Tyrion wasn\u2019t so\nlucky, and now faces being executed\nfor treason unless he can convince his\nfather and sister of his innocence.\nAway from King\u2019s Landing there\nis a bunch of wildlings South of the\nWall causing all sorts of trouble.\nTormund, Ygritte and their new pal\nStyr have been pillaging their way\naround the North and, in the case of\nStyr and the other Thenns, indulging\nin a little cannibalism. Since Styr\u2019s\narrival in the first episode, there\u2019s\nbeen an obvious tension between him\nand Tormund. Watching how this\nplays out should add an extra layer of\nintrigue to what is already going to be\na very interesting plot. If they do end\nup attacking Castle Black, it should\nbe a pretty exciting showdown. From\nthe inevitably tearful reunion of Jon\nand Ygritte to watching Tormund and\nhis wildlings with their particularly\nvicious combat techniques, it will be\none hell of a scene. If we\u2019re lucky, Styr\nmight eat Alliser Thorne...\nOberyn Martell in a rare fully-clothed scene\n\n"

It\u2019s in Dalston for\na start. Upstairs there\u2019s a\nburger joint that serves\nfood on trays, but to be fair, does\ndo a mean sweet potato burger and\nsome extraodinary cheesy chips, oh,\nthose cheesy chips\u2026 The stage is\nin the basement, and it\u2019s a fair size\nconsidering its location. Most venues\neast of Liverpool Street fit about 100\npatrons, but Birthday\u2019s has a capacity\nof around 250. That means they also\nget slightly bigger bands than I\u2019m used\nto travelling to Dalston for, including\nthe not that hipster Seahaven a few\nweeks ago. Supported by Battle\nLines, who seem to have not decided\non a coherent sound yet, and Nai\nHarvest, who are one of my favourite\nBritish bands at the moment.\nAfter those cheesy chips I really\ndidn\u2019t think my night could get any\nbetter, but the bands did their best.\nNai Harvest are at the forefront of\nthe UK emo scene. A garagey two-piece with intelligent guitar work\nand catchy tunes galore, they aren\u2019t\nfar off being able to headline venues\nlike Birthday\u2019s themselves. The tunes\nstarted early, with Whatever and\nI Don\u2019t Even Know straight off the\nbat. Nai Harvest always bring all\nthe energy of their music to the live\nsetting, but not all of the crunch. It\u2019s\nhard to provide all the range with only\ntwo of you and no studio magic, and\nNai Harvest sometimes to struggle in\nthe bass region. This certainly wasn\u2019t\nthe worst I\u2019ve seen them, but it still\nwasn\u2019t quite right. Ending with the\nbrilliant Sitcom Fade-In and Hold\nOpen My Head did a little to assuage\nmy problems though. It was a very\nshort set, cut shorter by Ben breaking\na string during the intro to their first\nattempt at Whatever. Of course, that\nis to be expected with a support slot,\nbut I certainly could have done with a\nbit more.\nSeahaven operate in the niche\nbetween alternative rock and post-hardcore, sounding like a slightly more\nmature Taking Back Sunday or the\nband that Placebo could have been.\nDebut EP Ghost and album Winter\nForever were both pretty catchy\nlistens, if perhaps not having the\nmusical depth to hold the attention\nfor too long. Their sophomore effort,\nReverie Music: Music for Escapism\nOnly, came out earlier this year, and\nits focus on a much more mellow\nsound produced a very interesting, if\nperhaps less exciting listen. Live they\ngo for a fairly even mix between tracks\noff both albums, making for a pretty\nvaried and interesting live show.\nOpening with Goodnight is a solid\nmove. It\u2019s Seahaven at their absolute\ncatchiest, and with some great\nshoutalong but highly introspective\nlyrics, it\u2019s one of their most popular.\nFollowing this up with standout track\noff Reverie Music, Andreas, is also a\ngood idea. It\u2019s indie rock with an edge,\nand it\u2019s really good. It sounds a bit like\nDevil and God era Brand New, except\nwith Kyle Soto\u2019s nasal mumbling (it\u2019s\nnot that bad). Seahaven\u2019s albums\nall seem to have a fairly even mix of\ngood and bad tracks, but luckily, they\nseem to have a fairly similar opinion\non which are the good ones as me.\nLove to Burn, Flesh and Wild West\nSelfishness are probably my other\nfavourite cuts off the new album,\nand dropping Black and White off of\nWinter Forever also goes down really\nwell. The one curveball off the new\nalbum is Highway Blues, a, well, blues\nsong. It\u2019s just Kyle and his guitar and\nit\u2019s surprisingly beautiful. Live it\u2019s\njust as touching, although the general\nchatter makes me think that perhaps\nothers didn\u2019t appreciate it as much as I\ndid. The crowd certainly did enjoy the\nclosing track: It\u2019s Over. Fitting both in\nstyle and in name, it\u2019s a great end to\nthe set, with the whole room having\none last singalong.\nOverall, I really enjoyed Seahaven.\nThey produced a really nice mix of\nheavy, catchy and mellow, and the\nvariety led to the set keeping my\ninterest throughout. They\u2019re certainly\nnot going to move mountains any\ntime soon, but they\u2019re good at what\nthey do, and they\u2019re worth checking\nout if you like your alt-rock with a\ntouch of heavy thrown in.\nAMS albums you may have missed!\nSt. Vincent - St. Vincent\nSt. Vincent released her first\nalbum, Marry Me, back in\n2007. It was pretty good.\n2009 saw Actor released, and\nthat was really good. 2011\u2019s\nStrange Mercy was absolutely\nspectacular. A stunningly\nwell crafted art pop record,\nit reamins one of the best\nthings released this decade.\nThen came an album with\nDavid Byrne of Talking\nHeads fame, which was, not surprisingly, a little too weird for\nits own good. I\u2019m a big Talking Heads fan, but to my mind, David\nByrne\u2019s experimental approach to things didn\u2019t set particularly\nwell with Annie Clark\u2019s extremely tight sound. Her fourth album\nis self-titled, but it\u2019s not particularly St. Vincent-esque. She\nseems to have taken a lot of tips from David Byrne. There\u2019s a\nvariety of sounds all over this record with fairly mixed success.\nThe dissonant guitar riff in Birth in Reverse is superb, while the\npsychedelic dream pop of Severed Crossed Fingers is a sound I\u2019d\nlove to see her expand on further. There\u2019s also the slightly less\ndifficult Psychopath and the synth filled yet surprisingly heavy\nHuey Newton to enjoy. It\u2019s taken me a few listens, but there is a lot\nto enjoy here. The glitchy opener Rattlesnake sounded like a huge\nmisstep on first listen, but I\u2019ve come round in time. This certainly\nisn\u2019t as good as Strange Mercy, and I don\u2019t think any number of\nlistens will change that, but this is definitely worth your time,\nespecially if you\u2019re willing to invest in it.\nHuman Hands - Human Hands\nHuman Hands released their\nself-titled debut album back\nin January, but I\u2019ve only just\ngotten round to listening to it.\nI should not have waited, this\nissuperb.Itisreallyrefreshing\nhearing an emo band who\nhave no interest in sounding\nlike a Kinsella project. Forget\nCap\u2019n Jazz and American\nFootball, Human Hands\nsound is mix of bands like\nChristie Front Drive, Indian Summer and Rites of Spring.\nIt\u2019s heavy, but it\u2019s dripping with emotion. The shouted vocals\ninterwined and often underlaid with muted singing, the pounding\ndrums and swirling dissonant riffs are all brought together with\nreally well written songs. Remain is an early highlight. It ebbs\nand flows and it\u2019s just absolutely gripping. Everything seems to be\nbarely restrained, until the last minute, where it\u2019s all released in a\ncacophony of anger. The structure of the tracks on this album is\nvery close to post-rock in a lot of ways, but unlike acts like Foxing\nand Prawn, Human Hands have no interest in making it pretty.\nThey don\u2019t want this to be easy listening, and it makes for a very\nrewarding listen. The run from Remain through to penultimate\ntrack Dust is just so good. It\u2019s a shame that the final track is 10\nminutes long and all a bit much. That doesn\u2019t stop it being a great\nalbum though, because it is top dollar.\nThis album is also available for name your price with no\nminimum so head over to humanhands.bandcamp.com to listen!\nWe Came Out Like Tigers - Ever-Crushed at Pecket\u2019s Well\nThis one only came out in\nmid-April, but it\u2019s already\nbecome one of my absolute\nfavourite albums of this year.\nWe Came Out Like Tigers\nare a politically charged black\nmetal influenced screamo\nband from Liverpool. They\nare one of my absolute\nfavourite bands to see live.\nWith the furious screams,\npounding blast beats and\nrants about Fascism, it\u2019s about as intense as live music can\nget, and it just blows me away every time. Their first album,\nAgelessness and Lack, was released back in 2012, and whilst it was\nreally good, it failed to catch the intensity of the live show with a\nslightly too thin mix. There are no such issues this time around.\nThe songs are at least as good, but the production is just so much\nbetter. To Ruin a Fine Tenor Voice is some of the most emotionally\ncharged screamo you\u2019ll find, and the mournful violin towards the\nend is just perfect (I may have forgotten to mention they have a\nviolin). The violin is probably what really separates this out from\nthe rest. It adds sorrow and beauty to otherwise furious music.\nOne negative is that the whole album is only 25 minutes long, but\nwhen it\u2019s this intense, that might be best for my emotional state...\nThis really is as good an album as I\u2019ve heard this year, so if you\u2019ve\nany interest in heavy music, check this out!\nThis album is available for name your price, starting at free,\nfrom wecameoutliketigers.bandcamp.com, so you\u2019ve no excuse!\nStuart Masson reviews some of this year\u2019s highlights that we didn\u2019t cover at the time (sorry)\n\n"

But Roberto Martinez\ncan be proud of their maiden seasons in the job. By contrast, Manchester City are still very much in\nthe title race, and with Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure both fit, they have\nthe incentive to end their poor run at\nGoodison Park and take the initiative\nagain in the battle at the top. 0-2\nChelsea vs. Norwich (Sunday, 4pm,\nSky Sports 1)\nDespite not picking up a single point\nyet under Neil Adams, you have to\nsay he has done a remarkable job, as\nbased on the number of chances created they should arguably have beaten\nFulham and picked up a point at least\nagainst Liverpool. But turning chances into goals has been the Canaries\u2019\nproblem all season long. Having gone\n77 home games without defeat prior\nto the Blues\u2019 last tie at Stamford Bridge\nagainst fellow strugglers Sunderland,\nJose Mourinho will not tolerate losing\n2 on the bounce and I expect normal\nservice to be resumed at the Bridge\nthis weekend. 3-0\nCrystal Palace vs. Liverpool (Mon-day, 8pm, Sky Sports 1)\nTony Pulis and Brendan Rodgers both\ndeserve to win the Manager of the\nSeason award after masterminding\ntwo very different success stories this\nseason. Palace, seemingly long gone\nwhen Pulis joined in late November,\nmight have been made a challenge for\na Europa League spot if the season\nwent on another couple of months,\nwhile to potentially rise from 7th to\n1st place in one season for the Reds is\neven more astonishing than Manchester United falling from 1st to 7th.\nSelhurst Park is now a mighty tough\nplace to visit, but Liverpool\u2019s mentality\nthis season has been to outscore their\nopponents, and with Palace short of\ngoalscorers, the Reds can win this. 1-2\nBest of the rest (Saturday 3pm unless stated)\nWest Ham vs. Tottenham (BT Sport\n1, Saturday 12:45pm): Big Sam will\nalways demand a performance from\nthe Hammers but even though he\nwon\u2019t get the manager\u2019s job full-time it\nseems, Tim Sherwood\u2019s Spurs are ending the season on a high. 0-1\nAston Villa vs. Hull: Realistically,\nboth these sides are surely safe as it is\nalmost impossible for the teams below\nthem to make up enough points to\ncatch them. Hull have an FA Cup Final to think about, Villa don\u2019t do home\nwins and a point apiece would settle\nany lingering relegation nerves. 1-1\nMan United vs. Sunderland: This is\na bad time for the Black Cats to travel\nto Old Trafford, as United will put in a\nshift for Ryan Giggs. But Gus Poyet\u2019s\nmen always raise their game against\nthe big boys so this won\u2019t be plain sailing for the outgoing champions. 3-1\nNewcastle vs. Cardiff: As has been\nthe case for several months now, the\nMagpies are on their summer holidays\nalready. The Bluebirds have to win at\nSt James\u2019 Park to stand any chance of\nsurvival, and having already done so in\nthe FA Cup, I think they will. 1-2\nStoke vs. Fulham: The Potters were\nmy tip for relegation at the start\nof the season but hats off to Mark\nHughes for overseeing their transition to a passing side. It has been a\nnightmare season for the Cottagers\nand they may be masters of the great\nescape, but this is fortress Britannia.\n2-1\nSwansea vs. Southampton: The\nSaints players will not want to risk\ninjuries with so many in contention\nfor the World Cup, while the Swans\nare safe, so this looks to me like a\ndead-rubber. 0-0\nArsenal vs. West Brom (Sunday\n1:30pm): It remains to be seen\nwhether this will be Arsene Wenger\u2019s\nlast home game in charge but either\nway, he will want them to finish in\nthe top 4 as they always have under\nhis tenure. Aaron Ramsey can lead\nthe Gunners to victory. 3-1\nUnderwater Hockey comes\n3rd at Nationals\nI\nmperial\u2019s Underwater Hockey\nteam won their first ever medal\nat the University Nationals\ntournament on Saturday 8th\nMarch in Plymouth, finishing\n3rd out of 17 teams.\nA team of 9 players went to\nPlymouth Life Centre (the home of\nTom Daley) over the weekend as part\nof the biggest students\u2019 underwater\nhockey tournament in the UK. We\nwere up against 17 teams, ranging\nfrom Oxford and Plymouth to places\nfurther afield such as Stirling and\nBangor. There were 3 Barbarian\nalumni teams from Plymouth,\nPortsmouth and Warwick, who were\nineligible to win the competition.\nThe Imperial team led by captain\nEric Leung & vice-captain, Rajeev\nDattani, were hoping for a top 5\nfinish. We had four young players who\nhad never played in a tournament\nbefore (Nathan Patel, Yiyu Wang,\nArnab Debnath and Derek So). The\nrelatively inexperienced players are\nbacked up by more experienced Alex\nWhittington, Dan Barker, David\nHarris and Rajeev Dattani.\nImperial College fought hard but\ndid not have the best start losing to\nPortsmouth A (1-2) and Plymouth\nA (0-5), the eventual winner, in the\nopening games. However, with every\nplayer giving 110%, team Imperial\nhad solid performances in the later\ngames. After some tough games\nwith Warwick A (1-1), Plymouth\nBarbarians (1-1), Liverpool (4-0) and\nOxford (3-1), team Imperial found\nthemselves finishing 5th in their\ngroup. A win over Stirling (6-0) in the\nplay-off put Imperial in the quarter\nfinal against Plymouth Barbarians. It\nwas a tense match, but the final score\nwas not in Imperial\u2019s favour. The\nscore was at 1-1 and a minute left to\nplay. Imperial had captain, Eric Leung,\nsent off and were down to 5 players.\nPlymouth Barbarians scored with 10\nseconds left on the clock. Losing the\ngame 2-1, the team were in the play\noff for 5th/6th place against Oxford.\nThere were two Barbarian teams who\nwere ineligible to win a medal in the\nsemi-final. A win over Oxford (4-0) gave Imperial a 5th place finish;\nmeaning Imperial came 3rd amongst\nthe student teams.\nThe team walked away with a medal\nhung round their necks for the first\ntime. It was a fantastic experience for\nyoung players in the team, and was\nthe last student nationals for some\nexperienced players (Dan Barker and\nRajeev Dattani). The team is looking\nforward to getting more new players.\nAnyone interested in trying out please\ncontact Eric Leung (swl12@ic.ac.uk).\nThanks to Sport Imperial for non-BUCS funding as well as to Plymouth\nUniversity Octopush Club and the\nBritish Octopush Association for\norganising the tournament.\nWhat is Underwater Hockey?\nUnderwater Hockey is a fast paced\nsport, played by teams of six at the\nbottom of a pool with four alternating\nsubstitute players. The aim of the\ngame is score more than the other\nteam by moving a lead puck along the\nbottom of the pool using a \u2018pusher\u2019.\nSnorkels allow the players to keep\nmoving with the game while they take\na quick breath between long dives. A\nteam scores by working together to\npush, flick and pass the puck down\nthe pitch and getting it into the\nopponent\u2019s goal. This is often achieved\nbest through skill rather than brute\nstrength- proven by the fact this is a\nmixed sport at adult level.\nWant to play?\nWe train every week at St.\nMary\u2019s pool, Paddington, at 8pm\non Mondays. This new and rapidly\nexpanding club is always looking for\nmore members.

    "content": "4 FRIDAY 02 MAY\nWELLBEING Editor: Marissa Lewis\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nn the last Wellbeing section, I\nwrote about my experience with\nrecovering from depression.\nMaybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t make a\nhabit of talking about my mental\nillness but I was genuinely surprised\nat the positive reception it received\nfrom friends, acquaintances and even\ncomplete strangers. As a follow-up, I\nwanted to give some advice around\nhow to help a friend with depression\nas, especially at such a stressful time\nof year, I hope this will prove useful.\nI actually found this article more\ndifficult to write than my last one and\nI think it\u2019s because life doesn\u2019t neatly\nsplit into \u2018depressed people\u2019 and\n\u2018friends of depressed people\u2019. At times\nyou may be one or the other or both\ntogether and they are both difficult\nroles to navigate. In terms of my own\nexperience, I was depressed at the\nsame time I was trying to care for a\nmentally ill parent and that inevitably\ntainted how I saw and experienced my\nown illness. Equally, writing down a\nlist of stuff that helped me when I was\nsick highlighted pretty starkly when I\nfailed to follow my own advice for my\ndepressed friends and relatives. It is\nreally easy to get defensive, but please\ndon\u2019t \u2013 the past is the past.\nOn that note, I\u2019ll start off by saying\nit is not easy caring about someone\nwho is depressed and I am speaking\nas someone who\u2019s been on both sides\nof the fence. When you\u2019re ill, it\u2019s\nreally difficult to communicate what\nis happening to you and if you\u2019ve\nalways been well, it\u2019s very difficult to\nunderstand. When my mother first\nstarted getting sick, I took this lack of\nunderstanding to be due to a lack of\nknowledge and diligently researched\neverything I could about bipolar\ndisorder: living with bipolar disorder,\ntreatments for bipolar disorder and\nso on. Although this was fascinating\nresearch, and I say that non-ironically,\nultimately it was useless as it didn\u2019t\nhelp me understand what I was really\nstruggling to cope with \u2013 namely being\nunable to help someone I loved who\nwas in pain and the effect the illness\nwas having on our relationship. My\nfirst piece of advice is that it is okay\nto acknowledge this stuff is hard on\nyou. It is normal to feel upset, afraid,\nfrustrated or anything else by a friend\nbeing mentally ill. You are in no way\nweak or selfish for feeling how you do.\nIn a similar vein, you have to\nrecognise you are entitled to protect\nyour own mental health. Although\nit may not be appropriate to talk to\nyour friend about your feelings, it is\nappropriate to talk to someone. I took\nthe rather bold step in the course of\nwriting this article to ask my friends\nwhat it was like to hang out with me\nduring that time of my life, and this\ncropped up fairly often. In retrospect,\nI said and did a lot of scary stuff when\nI was unwell and I don\u2019t think I truly\nappreciated how it had affected them.\nNot because I didn\u2019t care about them\nbut because I didn\u2019t understand how\nthey could possibly care about me.\nIt is more than okay to drop in and\nvisit a counsellor if you are finding it\ndifficult to cope and College has its\nown free counselling service if you are\nso inclined. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of\nplaying the suffering Olympics, where\nonly the friend who is suffering the\nmost deserves help \u2013 do what you\nneed to do to stay healthy.\nMy next piece of advice comes\ndirectly from one of my friends and it\nis simply to accept what you cannot\nchange. Depression can last for a\nlong time and, even on an effective\ntreatment program, it can take weeks\nto see signs of recovery. This can be\nfrustrating when you are putting effort\ninto helping and caring about your\nfriend, but as you don\u2019t cause their\ndepression, it isn\u2019t something you can\nfix. One of the things I was acutely\naware of was how frustrating and\nfrankly boring my illness was to my\nfriends. I know they wanted to help me\nand they wanted me to get better, but\nmy twisted thought patterns morphed\nthat concern into a feeling of failure\nthat I couldn\u2019t get better for them.\nIt\u2019s easy for well-meaning comments\nlike \u2018How can you be depressed when\nso many people care about you?\u2019 to\nslightly more obviously inappropriate\ncomments like \u2018Oh my God, Marissa,\npull yourself together!\u2019 to feed into\nthese feelings of failure. Instead, just\nreassure your friend you are there for\nthem and accept however long they\nneed to recover.\nDespite saying you can\u2019t cure\nsomeone with depression by caring,\nyou can make someone\u2019s life a hell\nof a lot easier so focus on practical\nsolutions to practical problems.\nHave you ever checked your phone\nand realised you received a text from\nsomeone weeks ago but kept putting\noff replying so now it would be too\nawkward to respond? Depression\nis like this on a colossal scale - it is\nreally, really easy to drop off the radar\nand you can adopt that mentality\ntowards everything. I felt if I hadn\u2019t\nseen my friends for a couple of weeks,\nthey wouldn\u2019t want to hear from me\nanymore. If I missed loads of classes,\nthat entire module or subject was lost.\nIf I already spent the week not eating\nor sleeping or any other unhealthy\nhabit, there was no point trying to\nrectify those habits. As a friend, this is\nprobably the easiest way to step in and\noffer help. If someone isn\u2019t attending\nclasses, offer to pick up course\nmaterials for them or give them your\nnotes. If someone is withdrawing from\nthe world, try and set up a regular time\nto do something together, like have a\ncup of tea or go for a walk and make\nit clear you don\u2019t mind if they cancel,\nyou\u2019ll keep the time open for them\nregardless. These are all little things\nbut they helped me find the world\na little less impossible and, when I\nwas recovering, it helped me realise I\nhadn\u2019t burned all of my bridges.\nIf your friend hasn\u2019t done so\nalready, encourage them to seek\nhelp and also recognise their first\nreaction may not be the end of the\nconversation. I get that it can be\nawkward or uncomfortable to drop\nwords like \u2018doctor\u2019 or \u2018counsellor\u2019 into\nconversations with friends and you can\nworry that it will upset them further.\nYou can get fixated on choosing the\nright words or the right time to bring\nthis up to avoid a negative reaction. If\nit\u2019s any comfort, from my experience\na person\u2019s reaction to these requests\nisn\u2019t dependent on how kindly they\nare encouraged to seek help but\ninstead is dependent on their attitudes\nto their own condition. Some people\nmay react abruptly or rudely to the\nassertion they need help if they are in\ndenial about their illness. Conversely\nand more commonly, some people are\nin dire need of that type of validation\nand need to hear that it wouldn\u2019t\nbe wasting anyone\u2019s time to get it\nchecked out. It is so easy to put off\nor avoid the rather mundane task of\nbooking appointments if you\u2019re left to\nyour own devices so gentle nudges to\ndo so are important. For me, it took\na good year of increasingly unsubtle\nprompts to seek help and a friend\naccompanying me to the GP with the\npromise of a hot chocolate debrief to\nget me to sit before a doctor. Basically,\nbe persistent but not overbearing\nand offer to accompany them if it\u2019s\nappropriate.\nThroughout everything, make sure\nyou go at their pace. Listening non-judgementally to a person talk about\ntheir depression is probably the most\nsupportive thing a friend can do. I felt\ntalking about depression was venting\nan incredibly dark and scary part of my\nlife \u2013 having friends willing to listen\nand not run in the other direction was\na really powerful and subtle way of\nshowing support. On the other hand,\nsometimes talking about your illness\nis the absolute last thing you want\nto do. \u2018Depression\u2019 can sometimes\nfeel like an identity over a diagnosis\nand one of the things I was keen to\navoid was being the dependent, needy\nfriend. I went to great lengths to act\nnormally and I was reluctant to talk\nabout what I was going through and,\nalthough that must have been pretty\nweird for my friends to witness, my\nadvice is to go with it. When I was\nsick, I absolutely wanted to hear about\nmy friend\u2019s boyfriend drama or to talk\nabout the OC (this show was pretty\nbig at my school) \u2013 I promise my\nfriends bringing this stuff up did not\ncome across as insensitive or trivial, it\nhelped me feel normal. Also, friends\ncoming to me with their problems\nmade me feel our relationships were\nless one-sided when I went to them\nwith mine.\nMy last piece of advice while I still\nhave your attention is to talk to your\nfriend. I get it: if mental illness was\neasy to talk about there probably\nwouldn\u2019t be a national campaign\nabout it. It is way too easy to get hung\nup about saying the wrong thing or\ncoming across as insensitive and you\nmight be tempted to give your friend\nsome space as a way of protecting\nthem. Please don\u2019t do this. It\u2019s worth\nsaying that we know you are human\nand you are probably going to make\nmistakes or say the wrong thing. You\ndefinitely won\u2019t have all the answers\nand you won\u2019t be perfect, but that isn\u2019t\nwhat we need when we\u2019re depressed.\nWe need friends and, last I checked,\nmy friends are all human.\nOne of the best things you can do is\nto say to a friend that you are there for\nthem and they can call/text/message/\nwhatever if they need to talk and this\nisn\u2019t a hassle for you. It is rare this\noffer will get taken up, speaking from\nexperience, but it is appreciated. If\nyou\u2019re not good at deep, emotional\ntalks, that\u2019s fine too, we can work\nwith that. If you don\u2019t see your friend\nfor a few days, maybe you could send\nthem a text to check in and ask about\nsomething you know you both enjoy.\nFor me, that could be \u2018Hi Marissa,\nhaven\u2019t seen you in a while! Did you\nsee the OC last night?\u2019 (yes, I\u2019m trying\nto make the OC happen). Because,\nseriously, I was rubbish at deep,\nemotional talks too. I would make\nreally poor jokes about my situation\nor use deliberately poor analogies or\ndo pretty much anything to make an\nawkward conversation more awkward.\nBeing depressed doesn\u2019t make you\nsome kind of tragic poet or prone to\neloquent monologues about how dire\nyour situation is \u2013 I was much better\nat talking about inconsequential\nstuff and felt better for just talking to\nsomeone a lot of the time.\nThat being said, although you\nshouldn\u2019t cease contact with a\ndepressed friend because they are\ndepressed, it is okay to say you can\u2019t\nhandle their problems at times if you\nare having a stressful time yourself. I\nknow this is a tricky line to tread and\nin these relationships you can end up\nfeeling you are the only thing keeping\nyour friend afloat. This is why it is\nreally important to encourage them to\nhave a network of support, with a mix\nof friends and professionals, that they\ncan turn to when they need it, rather\nthan just one person. Trust me, this is\na toxic situation and will only end up\nhurting both you and your friend.\nAfter reading this through, I realise\nmy advice about how to help your\ndepressed friend essentially boils\ndown to a lot of listening and talking\nand the odd home-cooked meal. It\ndoesn\u2019t seem like much and I can\nsee how it would be really tempting\nto want to gallop in on a white horse\nand rescue your friend from the jaws\nof depression or something equally\nas dramatic. In this case, I reckon my\nfriend explains it better than me: \u201cIt\ntakes a while before you understand\nthat actually just being there is\nenough.\u201d\nMarissa Lewis\nWellbeing Editor\nHelping friends with depression\nMyself (centre), my friend (right of centre) and some travelling companions at the\nGrand Canyon, showcasing my variable hair styles.\nHyperbole and a half (2013)\nA demonstration of how not to help a friend who is suffering with depression.\n\n"

The weather\nand train engineering works did\nnot seem to be in the team\u2019s favour\nbut once on the pitch, little could\nstop Imperial continuing to play some\nmagnificent rugby.\nThe game began with both sides\nlooking pretty even. They were well\nmatched in the forwards, with possession being kept by the attacking side\nthrough good supporting play around\nthe breakdown. In a classic forward\nplay from the maul, Heather Grant\nwent over for a decisive try.\nEventually, Kingston got sloppy over\nthe ball and were penalised on multiple occasions for not rolling away\nat the tackle. They didn\u2019t learn from\nthe quick tap penalty which allowed\nImperial to gain forward momentum\nmore than once and score.\nKingston clawed one back using the\nwind to kick into the distance and allowing their pacey wingers capitalise\non the 50-50 balls. At half time, both\nteams had scored but Imperial led by\nthree tries to two.\nIn the second half, Imperial put\npressure on Kingston\u2019s clearance kick\nwhich led to the most spectacular\nindividual try by Clara Gago on the\nwing. She caught the ball just beside\nthe try line on the 22 m line and held\nstrong to break two tackles and score\nright in the corner.\nChanging tactics Imperial opted\nto exploit their strong centre combination and pass out quickly in the\nbacks. Inside centre Charlie Stephens\ncrashed through to score a hat trick\nand was well supported by outside\ncentre and player of the match, Carolanne Vouriot.\nImperial could\u2019ve extended their\nlead if only they chose to pass out\nmore and exploit the overlap from the\nwing. However, they kept moving forward thanks to supporting runs from\nforward of the match Kirsty Edward\nwho followed up every break.\nHowever, Imperial\u2019s performance\ncouldn\u2019t be equalled with the final\nscore at 58-10. Congratulations to the\nteam to securing the LUSL championship again!\nT\nhe Imperial Falcons\nparticipated in the BSUK\nInter-university Baseball\nSpring Cup over the\nweekend of the 22nd and\n23rd of March with a team composed\nlargely of newcomers and achieved\na respectable third place finish after\nclose losses to the top two teams.\nThe Falcons opened up their\ncampaign with a rousing 15-6\ndemolition of the UCL Capitals with\na strong pitching performance from\nfreshman pitcher Zack Wang. The\nteam also put up a good offensive\nshowing with 6 hits and 8 walks\ndrawn. The huge win put the Falcons\nin first place overall going into the\nsecond game against the Nottingham\nThieves who had earlier been routed\nby the University of East Anglia Blue\nSox 17-7.\nThe second game got off to a good\nstart with the Falcons cycling through\nthe entire batting order for 4 runs off 2\nwalks and 4 hits from Matt, Stephane,\nAshley and Zack. One more run would\nhave scored but third batter Rhys was\ntagged out at home in an attempt to\nsteal. The Thieves then put up a strong\nbatting performance and capitalized\non Falcon errors to score 3 runs and\nget back in the game. The second\ninning saw the Falcons extend the lead\nby 1 run before closing out the inning\nin style with ace pitcher Vincent Li\nputting up a monster performance\nwith 2 strike outs to give the Falcons\ntheir first 1-2-3 inning. The third\ninning saw the Falcons pile on more\npressure with shortstop Ashley\nleading off with a massive ground rule\ndouble that was centimeters shy of a\nhomerun. Vincent and club president\nChris Carter then drove in 2 more runs\nto give the Falcons a commanding 4\nrun lead. The Thieves responded well\nhowever and answered with 3 runs of\ntheir own to bring themselves back in\nthe game. The fourth inning proved\nto be the most disastrous one yet for\nthe Falcons, as they failed to score\nany runs and committed multiple\nerrors to allow the Thieves to score\n5 runs and take the lead which they\ndid not relinquish for the rest of the\ngame. Despite a huge 2-run homer\nfrom Zack in the top of the sixth, the\nFalcons fell to a 10-15 defeat, putting\nthem in second place going into\nthe final round-robin game against\ntournament favourites, the UEA Blue\nSox.\nAfter a much needed rest, the\nFalcons were back in action on\nSunday against the Blue Sox. The\nFalcons exploded out of the gates\nwith a massive 8 run top of the first\nto instantly take a commanding lead\nagainst the Blue Sox. Ace Vincent then\nheld the Blue Sox offense to 3 runs\nto give the Falcons a 5 run cushion.\nHowever, the Blue Sox then stepped\nup their game and showed their\ncredentials as tournament favourites\nto score 19 runs while holding the\nFalcons to none in subsequent innings.\nA late pitching switch by the Blue Sox\nallowed the Falcons to notch up some\nmore runs for a respectable 18-24\nscoreline as the Falcons fell to third\nplace in the tournament standings.\nFollowing a walkover over the UCL\nCapitals in the third place play-off, the\nFalcons emerged as overall third in the\nSpring Cup. Despite the disappointing\nshowing, the Falcons showed their\nstrong potential with newcomers\nAlex, Stefan, Rhys and Monal\nputting up strong performances in\nthe field and on the plate. With the\nstrong improvements made despite a\nlimited training schedule, the Falcons\nare confident of better results in\nthe coming year as the team looks\nforward to the BSUK Inter-university\nSoftball tournament on Saturday\n(29th March).\nBaseball Softball UK InterUniversity Baseball Spring Cup\nKath Fok\nIC Women\u2019s Rugby\nAshley Ng Ding Wen\nImperial Falcons\n02/05/14\nIssue 1574\nfelixonline.co.uk\nUnderwater Hockey comes 3rd at Nationals\n\n"

    "content": "13\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 02 MAY\nFILM\ntudying: part 2\nThe obvious point to be made here is\nthat not only is this yet another sequel,\nit\u2019s also a sequel to a reboot to a film\nseries that was barely a decade old the\nfirst time around. And so it is again,\nwith this reboot sequel coming ten\nyears after the best film in the original trilogy. The Empire Strikes Back\nof Spider-Man, if you will (you don\u2019t\nhave to, it\u2019s okay).\nThe opening instantly goes back to\nthe big unresolved mystery of the first\nfilm: the sudden disappearance of Peter\u2019s parents. There\u2019s a few repeated\nshots, and then a hefty dose of extra\nexplanation (and even some action),\nbut it\u2019s all still very confusing. Which\nis kind of good. It\u2019s an interesting mys-tery, but it was never the strong point\nof the first film and it\u2019s not the strong\npoint again here.\nNo, that honour once again goes\nto the chemistry between Andrew\nGarfield and Emma Stone as Peter\nParker and Gwen Stacy (respectively,\nobviously). Their scenes are, if not the\nbest in the film, certainly among the\nstrongest performance and direction-wise, as Webb\u2019s rom-com roots continue to shine through. The film invests a hefty chunk of its running time\nin their relationship, although at an already extensive 142 minutes\u2019 worth of\nscreen time you can\u2019t help but feel like\nmaybe one or two of the slower scenes\ncould have been dropped (or at the\nvery least, trimmed down) in favour of\npushing the plot forwards.\nActually pushing the plot forwards\n(and threatening to steal the show into\nthe bargain) is left mostly to the trio\nof villains that face off against Spidey\nthis time around. Avoiding the trap of\nSpider-Man 3, which ended up juggling too many problems and collapsing under its own weight, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 manages to allow\neach villain space to breathe, giving\nthem organic origin stories that eventually tie together nicely. Paul Giamatti seems to be having the most fun\nenjoying the taste of scenery as AlexThe Amazing SpiderMan 2\nDirector: Marc Webb\nWriters: Alex Kurtzman, Roberto\nOrci, Jeff Pinker, James Vanderbilt\nStarring: Andrew Garfield, Emma\nStone, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx,\nSally Field, Paul Giamatti\nRuntime: 142 minutes\nCertification: 12A sei Sytsevich, future Rhino, but the\nmain enemies here are Jamie Foxx\u2019s\nElectro and Dane DeHaan\u2019s Green\nGoblin. Pre-transformation, Foxx is\nendearingly bumbling as the socially\nawkward Max Dillon (even if some of\nhis motivations do feel a little shoehorned in to give him a strong enough\nreason to fight Spider-Man, Foxx plays\nit just right), while DeHaan\u2019s Harry\nOsborn is in stark contrast to the\nnewly confident, swaggering Peter \u2013 a\nbundle of twitchy, nervous energy just\nwaiting to explode.\nAnd explode he does, and all in\nslightly useless 3D. The action scenes\nare bigger (and arguably) better than\nbefore, Webb seemingly feeling a little more confident this time, but with\nElectro\u2019s bolts firing off left, right\nand centre and a lot usually going on,\nsometimes the screen can get a little\ntoo busy, making some of the action\nbeats a little harder to follow. Nothing\nparticularly major, just a minor quirk\nthat will almost certainly get ironed\nout come the third (and fourth, that\u2019s\na thing too) film.\nPlot-wise, The Amazing Spider-Man\n2 is somewhat hit-and-miss, with the\nmystery of the parents being resolved\nin a decidedly rapid and anticlimactic\nfashion (a consequence, no doubt, of\nsome brutal editing to cut the run-time, or perhaps a side-effect of the\nalterations made in the first film that\nremoved whole swathes of material on\nthe same subject), although there are\nsome events with resounding implications for the future films. It\u2019s worth\nnoting that Shailene Woodley\u2019s scenes\nas Mary Jane were cut from the film\n(probably a good thing, on reflec-tion, it was already long enough), but\nthere\u2019s a clear direction for the series\nto go from here, a clarity aided by the\nintroduction of the Sinister Six come\nthe film\u2019s close. There\u2019s still some issues with pacing, and with character\ndevelopment, but it\u2019s an improvement\nover the first film\u2019s issues. It\u2019s a blast to\nwatch, albeit one which fails to stick\nin the memory. The only way is up for\nthe reboot, and if the third film can\nkeep up the pace this series could soon\nexceed the originals (although SpiderMan 2 remains, I think, the best entry\nso far).\nCalvary\nDirector: Marc Webb\nWriter: John Michael McDonaugh\nStarring: Brendan Gleeson, Chris\nO\u2019Dowd, Kelly Reilly, Aidan Gillen\nRuntime: 100 minutes\nCertification: 15\nFollowing on from their previous effort The Guard, director John Michael\nMcDonagh (brother of Marty) have\nteamed up again for Calvary, the tale\nof a well-meaning, innocent priest\ntold in the confessional that he has\nonly a week left to live. Where Marty\nmanaged to make an instant classic in\nIn Bruges (also starring Gleeson, interestingly enough), before following it\nup with Seven Psychopaths, an enjoy-ably Tarantino-esque romp that was\nperhaps too smart for its own good,\nJohn appears to have trodden the inverse path. Where The Guard was\npretty damn good, Calvary is downright incredible.\nIt shares the very (very, very, very,\nvery) dark sense of humour of The\nGuard, albeit now mixed in with a\nstrong sense of melancholy and emo-tion, as Gleeson\u2019s Father James attempts to come to terms with his impending death. There\u2019s a whole net of\nsupporting characters, all with their\nown quirks, all deftly sketched out by\nMcDonagh, with a \u2018who\u2019ll-do-it\u2019 air (a\nwho-dunnit would be a total misno-mer, what with them not having done\nit yet) hanging over it all. Kelly Reilly is\nheart-wrenching as Father James\u2019 self-harming daughter, while Aiden Gillen\n(Littlefinger from Game of Thrones,\nfor the few of you who might watch\nthat small show)\u2019s atheist doctor has\nquite possibly the most unnerving anecdote you\u2019ll hear in a film. It\u2019s shiver-inducing even recalling it. The rest of\nthe cast are impeccable, from Dylan\nMoran to Chris O\u2019Dowd (nice to see\nhim in something a little bit smaller\nthan his new-found Hollywood fame),\nbut really the entire gig hinges on\nGleeson, and he pulls it off. He more\nthan pulls it off, to be honest. It\u2019s an\nutterly compelling performance that\ndeserves far more recognition that it\nwill likely get.\nIf I\u2019m totally honest, that\u2019s pretty\nmuch all there is to Calvary. It\u2019s very\nmuch the story of Father James, and\neverything revolves around his impending murder \u2013 or at least, how we\nview it does. The inhabitants of his\nvillage all live their own lives, with a\nwhole casket load of problems apiece,\nbut it is through the lens of Father\nJames, so desperately trying to be a\ngood man, to support them all only\nto find a vicious backlash against the\ninstitution he represents, that we encounter them.\nTo diminish Calvary to just that in\nthe praise stakes would be unfair, and\nit should here be said that it is quite\npossibly the most heart-wrenching,\ndeeply personal and painfully involving film to come out so far this year.\nThe visuals are stark, making use of\nthe Irish landscape, and the music\nsombre. The whole thing is never less\nthan gripping, and its final moments\nwill leave you in a state of shock. I\ndaren\u2019t say any more for fear of spoiling it, and I\u2019m not sure I can add anything else anyway. Calvary demands\nto be experienced.

One of the\nmore polarising \ufb01gures taking part in\nthis year\u2019s competition, Conchita has\nbeen the subject of social media campaigns in Austria calling for her to be\nreplaced. There was even a petition in\nBelarus asking for her to be removed\nfrom the national broadcast on the\ngrounds that she would turn the event\ninto a \u2018hotbed of sodomy\u2019. Austria has\nonly been in the grand \ufb01nal once since\n2005, but Conchita Wurst stands a\nvery good chance of getting there this\nyear. Her song, Rise Like A Phoenix,\nmirrors the style of the great James\nBond themes. With Conchita\u2019s strong\nvoice, plenty of strings and the occasional screaming trumpet, this entry is\none of my personal favourites.\nAustria\nA picture paints a thousand words, in\nthis case, all of them bearded.\nGoing back to 1956, with one to six hundred million viewers annually, the\nEurovision Song Contest is one of the largest-scale and longest-running\ntelevision events in the world. This year thirty-seven countries will battle it out\nin Copenhagen for victory and the opportunity to host the competition in 2015.\nHere is my list of the top ten hottest songs to look out for this year!\nAzerbaijan\nNot to be confused with Aston Villa extraordinaire Bosco Balaban.\nNorway holds both the record for the\nmost notorious \u2018nul points\u2019 scored\nand the record for the highest scoring\nsong in Eurovision history (\u2018Fairytale\u2019\nby Alexander Rybak, 2009). Norway is\nhoping for a win this year with \u2018Silent\nStorm\u2019 by Carl Espen. A slow but\nmoving song, Norway is likely to place\nhighly this year.\nDenmark\u2019s Basim will be performing\nto his home crowd this year with\nhis Clich\u00e9 Love Song, so expect a\ndeafeningly euphoric response from\nthe arena for him. With its upbeat\nmelody and delightfully cheesy lyrics,\nDenmark has entered a song that is\nsimple, quintessential Eurovision.\nBeing the host country, this song\nautomatically quali\ufb01es for the grand\n\ufb01nal. Denmark is hoping for a second\nwin after Emmelie De Forest took\n\ufb01rst place in Malm\u00f6 last year, and\nBasim just might do it for them.\nOften a subject of Great British moaning, the UK has not done brilliantly in the\ncontest recently, coming last three times since 2003. However this year could see\nthe UK perform very well indeed. They are sending up and coming singer/song-writer Molly with her own song Children Of The Universe, an exciting, powerful\nsong that\u2019s sure to get the crowd going. Being a member of the \u2018Big Five\u2019, the UK\nautomatically quali\ufb01es for the grand \ufb01nal and although I don\u2019t expect the UK to\nwin, I think Molly could get pretty close this year.\nAzerbaijan debuted at Eurovision in\n2008 and has since taken the competition by storm, \ufb01nishing in the top\n\ufb01ve each year since 2009 and winning\nin 2011. This year they are hoping for\nvictory with operatically trained Dilara Kazimova and her song Start A\nFire. Slow and contemplative, it echoes Azerbaijan\u2019s 2012 entry When The\nMusic Dies, with downbeat but hopeful lyrics and extensive use of the bala-ban, the Azerbaijani national musical\ninstrument. I predict another top \ufb01ve\n\ufb01nish for Azerbaijan. Starting a \ufb01re in the hearts of millions.\nUnited\nKingdom\nMy money is on Molly looking a little less cheery come results night.\nThe contest this year will be held in the larger of these really big sheds. Looks pretty glamorous!\nNorway\nDenmark\nLast year\u02bcs winner, Emmelie de Forest. She\u02bcll be performing during the interval this year.\nA somewhat less surprising beard.\nBasim shows that age is just a number.\nA really small number.\nSweden is sending Sanna Nielsen\nacross the iconic \u00d6resund Bridge to\nDenmark to perform the song Undo.\nWith a slow start, this song eventually\nturns into a punchy dance anthem.\nSanna is a star who has topped the\nSwedish charts multiple times and\nshe\u2019s no stranger to the stage. Does\nshe have what it takes to steal the\nEurovision title back from Denmark?\nSince the introduction of semi-\ufb01nals\nin 2004, Ukraine is one of the few\nnon-\u2018Big Five\u2019 countries to have never\nfailed to qualify for the grand \ufb01nal.\nThere\u2019s no doubt they\u2019ll maintain that\nthis year with Tick \u2013 Tock by Mariya\nYaremchuk. 2014 marks the ten-year\nanniversary of Ukraine\u2019s \ufb01rst and only\nEurovision victory. This energetic, fun\nsong is likely to do very well.\nAndr\u00e1s K\u00e1llay-Saunders will represent Hungary with his song Running\nthat he wrote himself about domestic\nviolence and child abuse, a topic he\nwants to raise awareness of. Running\nhas the originality and strength to do\nvery well this year. Hungary has never\nplaced in the top 3, could this be their\nchance?\nOne of this year\u2019s favourites to win,\nArmenia has entered the song Not\nAlone by Aram MP3, the host of Armenian X-Factor and Armenian Idol.\nWith a quiet and dark start, it quickly\ntakes a sharp turn into a powerful,\ndubstep-esque number that will surely\nplease the crowds both in Copenhagen\nand at home. Don\u2019t be surprised to see\nEurovision 2015 take place in the Armenian capital, Yerevan.\nPaula Serling and OVI won third\nplace for Romania in 2010 and this\nyear they\u2019re back. Just like their fantastic 2010 entry Playing With Fire, Miracle is a catchy, toe-tappingly rhythmic\ndance track with a superb keyboard\npart, owing to Paula\u2019s classical piano\ntraining. Romania has never won the\ncontest, but I have a feeling Paula and\nOVI could better their 2010 performance and place second or \ufb01rst this\nyear.\nSweden\nArmenia\nUkraine\nRomania\nHungary\nThis year\u02bcs trio of hosts. Probably the \ufb01rst time they\u02bcve ever been in a shipyard...\nTo be fair, he does host Armenian Idol.\nShe doesn\u02bct look like a thief...\nTick, tock, tick, tock, nope, no caption...\nWill Paula get her miracle?\nPaula and Ovi have had a go before, and if it got this intense \ufb01rst time around...\nAndr\u00e1s does not host Hungarian Idol.\nAnd why wouldn\u02bct you? (Please do not contact the music editors to answer this)\nBut that\u2019s not all! These are just ten of thirty-seven songs in this year\u2019s competi-tion. In the \ufb01rst semi-\ufb01nal on May 6th we\u2019ll hear Iceland\u2019s cheesy but fun, funky\nand rainbow-\ufb01lled No Prejudice\u2019 by Pollap\u00f6nk and see Valentina Monetta represent San Marino for the fourth year in a row! On May 8th we\u2019ll hear Georgia\u2019s\neccentric and folky Three Minutes To Earth by The Shin and Mariko in the second semi-\ufb01nal, along with many others.\nOf the thirty-seven countries, twenty-six will qualify for the grand \ufb01nal on\nMay the 10th, and judging by the entries it\u2019s going to be a crazy, fun and eclectic\nwhirlwind of a night. Don\u2019t miss it!\nYou can watch the semi-\ufb01nals on BBC Three on Tuesday 6th and Thursday 8th.\nThe \ufb01nal will be broadcast on BBC One on Saturday 10th.\n\n"

The story follows\neveryman Arthur Dent, who is\nrescued from the demolition of\nthe planet Earth in order to build a\nhyperspace bypass, by his best friend\nFord Prefect, who he discovers\nis actually an alien from \u201ca small\nplanet somewhere in the vicinity of\nBetelgeuse.\u201d\nThe books are all wonderfully\ninventive in their absurdity. Adams\nwas a comic genius who managed\nto create both a unique and\ncolourful universe as well as fun and\ncompelling characters. There are\nlaughs on every page and the series\nis a quick and easy read but it is also\nvery well written and has a surprising\ndepth. A must read.\nSummer Reading Picks\nLove Books?\nWant to see YOUR name in print?\nSend your reviews, features and author\nprofiles to books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSpace Captain Smith\nToby Frost\nToby Frost has often been referred\nto as Douglas Adams\u2019 spiritual\nsuccessor and his first novel,\nfollowing hapless Captain Isambard\nSmith of the British Space Empire\u2019s\nRoyal Space Navy, certainly doesn\u2019t\ndisappoint.\nThe book is very accessible and\nlaugh out loud funny, with a lot of\nbroad humour and jokes on topics\nsuch a traditional British stuffiness.\nHowever, this is a particular treat for\nlong time fans of science fiction, with\ncountless references to, and homages\nof, classics of the genre \u2013 from Blade\nRunner to Starship Troopers.\nThe novel also manages to be an\nengaging action story, of a type\nrarely seen nowadays in SF fiction.\nThe plot is fast moving and exciting,\nwhile never feeling superficial, and\nthe characters are well sketched and\nlikable.\nCollected Stories\nEvelyn Waugh\nEarly twentieth century writer Evelyn\nWaugh is widely regarded as one of\nthe greatest masters of the English\nlanguage. Possessed of a keen insight\nand sharp wit his work is always\nboth intellectually stimulating and a\npleasure to read.\nThis collection of short stories\nspans Waugh\u2019s entire career, covering\na number of different themes and\nstyles of writing. Enthusiasts and\nscholars of Waugh will appreciate\nthis book as a chance to get a better\nunderstanding of his development as\na writer. Many of the stories are also\nlinked to, and help provide one with\na deeper understanding of, some of\nWaugh\u2019s longer work.\nThe Collected Stories, however, are\nalso a brilliant introduction to the\nwriter for novices. Pick up the book\nand dive into one of the stories \u2013\nyou\u2019re sure not to regret it.\nThe Third Bear\nJeff VanderMeer\nJeff VanderMeer is one of the leading\nfigures of the New Weird movement,\nwhich aims to link fantastical and\nsupernatural fiction with high\nliterary quality. This short collection\nis one of the best examples of this\nnew subgenre.\nVanderMeer has an amazing\nimagination, creating a wide range of\nfantastical, unsettling and downright\nbizzare settings and characters.\nThese work well together with\nVanderMeer\u2019s mastery of style, tone\nand atmosphere to create powerful\nand surreal fiction.\nIt is difficult to describe the\nindividual stories since they are\ncompletely different from anything\nelse that I have ever read before,\nand from each other. If you want to\nexperience something unique and\nutterly original be sure to check this\nout.\nCandide\nVoltaire\nThough first published in over 250\nyears ago, in 1759, Voltaire\u2019s great\nsatire of the classical philosophy of\nLeibnizian optimism still retains its\nrelevance today.\nThe novel follows the eponymous\nprotagonist, who lives in luxury in\nthe castle of his uncle, the Baron\nThunder-ten-Tronckh. Instructed\nand encouraged by his tutor Pangloss,\nhe firmly believes that the world he\nis living in is \u201cbest of all possible\nworlds\u201d. However his idyllic life is\nsoon disrupted as he is thrown out by\nhis uncle and, as he begins to explore\nthe wider world, he begins to find it\nmore and more difficult to reconcile\nhis philosophy with the real world.\nVoltaire\u2019s legendary wit is on full\ndisplay in this work and one can\neasily see why it has inspired so many\npeople. It\u2019s a very short novel, but one\ncertainly worth looking up.\n\n"

For those of you who\nsomehow missed the first one, this\nis the second strike instituted by\nthe Rail, Maritime and Transport\nUnion (RMT) as they protest the\nplanned closure of all of London\nUnderground\u2019s ticket offices. This\nlatest 48-hour walkout comes after a\nplanned strike in March was halted by\nthe RMT at the eleventh hour \u2013 but\nunfortunately for Londoners, no such\nreprieve came this time around.\nThe dispute began several months\nago when TfL, chaired by the Mayor of\nLondon Boris Johnson, announced its\nmodernisation program for the tube.\nThis plan envisaged increasing some\ntube services to run 24 hours a day\nover the coming years, and shutting\nthe ticket offices at stations (which are\nallegedly a drain on resources that is\nused on fewer than 3% of journeys).\nUnder this agreement, there would\nhave been no compulsory job losses\n\u2013 but the RMT leadership refused\nto accept this and balloted their\nmembers on calling a strike. Despite\nonly around 30% of the RMT\u2019s London\nUnderground Chapter members\nvoting in favour of industrial action,\nstrikes were announced by the former\nleader of the RMT Bob Crow earlier\nthis year.\nFollowing the successful mediation,\nthere was hope amongst Londoners\nthat they would be spared further\ndisruption, however the process\ntook an unexpected turn following\nthe shock death of Bob Crow from a\nheart attack in March of this year. The\ntimeline of events has led to some\nsuggesting that this latest strike is a\nmanifestation of the RMT\u2019s infighting,\nas different hard-left members of the\nunion attempt to gain their members\u2019\nloyaltybeforetheupcomingleadership\nelection \u2013 though the front-runners in\nthe election unsurprisingly deny this.\nIn addition to the expected\nopposition from Johnson who called\nthe strike \u2018pointless\u2019 and \u2018farcical\u2019,\nboth David Cameron and Ed Miliband\nhave stepped in, with the Labour\nParty leader saying that it was \u2018wrong\nfor the strike to go ahead whilst\nnegotiations were still taking place\u2019.\nLondon Underground\u2019s Managing\nDirector Mike Brown offered the\nchance for a review of the decisions\nmade so far, but insisted that the ticket\noffices would remain closed. The RMT\ndismissed the offer as meaningless.\nThe Tube chaos has seen the\ncity\u2019s streets grind to a standstill.\nTfL is running nearly 300 extra\nbuses including several heritage\nroutemasters, but even this couldn\u2019t\nalleviate the gridlock that faced many\ncommuters on their journeys today,\nwhilst in the west of the city the travel\nchaos was heightened by a separate\nstrike on the Heathrow Express by\nRMT workers. In addition to the 40\nmediation meetings held to date,\nmore will no doubt happen over the\ncoming days.\nWhether they will come to any\nfruition with both sides refusing to\nback down is another question, but we\ncan only hope\u2026\nTravel Chaos \u2013 Strikes Again!\nBen Fernando\nCharities Editor\nurbanstimes.co\nNEWS FROM OVER EASTER\nScientists Discover\nDwarf Planet\nJoe Letts Editor-In-Chief\nThe newly discovered dwarf\nplanet 2012 VP113 was discovered\nby astronomers at the Carnegie\nInstitution of Science, Washington in\nApril.\nWith a diameter of 450km it is the\nsmallest celestial body to lay claim\nto the title of the most distant planet\nin the solar system, usurping dwarf\nplanet Sedna (2003). Precisely, while\nSedna is the body in the solar system\nthat travels furthest from the Sun,\nwith an orbit ranging from 76-937\nAU, 2012 VP113's minimum distance\nfrom the Sun is 80AU, and so qualifies\nas the most distant solar system object\nwhen ranked by minimum distance.\nNicknamed \u2018VP\u2019, the discovery of\nthe dwarf planet proves the existence\nof the inner Oort cloud, a doughnut-shaped region in the spherical outer\nOort cloud. The Oort cloud is a region\nof icy bodies that exists far outside\nNeptune\u2019s orbit.\nLooking at the elliptical orbits\nof both 2012 VP113 and Sedna,\nastronomers believe that there may\nbe a large undiscovered planet that\ninterferes with their orbits due to its\nlarge gravitational pull. Nicknamed\n\u201csuper-Earth\u201d, it would in theory need\nto have a mass 10x greater than Earth\nand orbit the Sun at roughly 250 AU.\nEvelyn Gardens Set\nTo Close in 2015\nAccording to anonymous sources,\nthe entire network of halls in Evelyn\nGardens (providing accommodation\nforatotalof613students),issettoclose\nin 2015, with student accommodation\nspaces being transferred to the\naccommodation in Acton that is\nunder current development.\nThe fate of the accommodation in\nSouth Kensington seems unclear,\nwith some of those involved believing\nthat the halls will be refurbished, and\nopened again for use, while others\nbelieve that due to the short number\nof years left on the Evelyn Gardens\nlease (less than 30 years), College will\ndeem the investment (rumored to be\nbetween \u00a310-60 million unviable and\nwill permanently relocate the hall\nspaces to the halls in Acton.\nA College Spokesperson provided\nthe following statement:\n\u201cImperial commits to provide all first\nyear students with a place in a hall of\nresidence and aims to offer a broad\nrange of room types and rents. To do\nso the College continually reviews its\naccommodation portfolio to ensure it\nmeets current and future needs. The\nCollege leases Evelyn Gardens. With\nthe lease set to expire in 34 years,\nImperial is currently exploring options\nfor the future of this accommodation.\nFrom 2015 the hall will either be closed\nfor a period while refurbishment takes\nplace, or the property will be removed\nfrom Imperial\u2019s accommodation\nportfolio.\n\u201d\nHonors For Imperial Academics\nJoe Letts\nEditor-In-Chief\nP\nrofessor Erol Gelenbe\n(Dennis Gabor Chair,\nDept. Electrical and\nElectronic Engineering)\nwas recently awarded\nthe honour of Chevalier de la Legion\nd\u2019Honneur (Knight of the Legion of\nHonour) by French President Francois\nHollande for 43 years of service in\nHigher Education and Research.\nProfessor Gelenbe, who also holds\nan Honorary Professorship at the\nUniversity Ren\u00e9 Descartes, invented\nthe Random Neural Network Model\nand is highly respected in the field\nof Computer System and Network\nPerformance Evaluation.\nMeanwhile Regius Professor of\nEngineering Chris Toumazou was\nnominated by the European Patent\nOffice as a finalist in the \u2018Reseach\nInventor Award 2014 earlier this week.\nProfessor Tomazou is known for\nthe development of a speedy DNA\ntest that is run by a microchip on\na USB stick. In just 20 minutes the\nchip detects differences in DNA by\nmeasuring hydrogen ions that are\nreleased during the synthesis of DNA.\nThe professor is one of 15 finalists,\nspread between the categories:\nIndustry, SMEs, Research, NonEuropean countries, Lifetime\nachievement.\nProfessor Mike Finnis was presented\nthe Humboldt Research Award by the\nGerman \u201cAlexander von Humbboldt\nFoundation\u201d. The award, which is\ngiven in recognition of the entire\nlifetime achievements of an academic,\nis valued at 60,000 EUR and includes\na year long invitation to work with\ngerman scientists on a long-term\nresearch project.\nAnother academic, Professor Sir\nBrian Hoskins, the first Director of\nthe Grantham Institute for Climate\nChange will be presented the 2014\nBuys Ballot Medal by the Royal\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences for his\nwork in Meteorology.\nFinally, while not an academic,\nthe Rt.

Oh well, back to the drawing board...\nDP - Finance & Services\nThis week we saw the DPFS taking a quick yoyo break outside the\nbar as he took a breather from trying to make Metric popular.

Our eager photographers\nmanaged to snap a picture of her blowing up over Govey\u2019s latest ploy\nbefore calling a wetworks company...\nThis week Felix found the DPW cavorting around in a room full of\nsmall dogs. Lamenting the inability of the pet suppliers who apparently couldn\u2019t tell the difference between small dogs and puppies, she\nset about trying to get students to \u201cstress less\u201d. Unfortunately, the\nstudents in the library caf\u00e9 only began to stress more when it turned\nout that the dogs had diarrhoea and liberally coated the entire room\nwith HP sauce. Regent\u2019s Park always had a shit-zoo...\nThis week we we\u2019re bored, so very bored.

    "content": "8 FRIDAY 02 MAY\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nO\nver the last few\nmonths Felix has\nbroken two stories\nabout Union Club,\nSociety and Project\nelection mismanagement. Most\nrecently we wrote about the rules\nbroken during the elections held by\nthe Chinese Students and Scholars\nAssociation which contravened\nUnion election rules, especially when\nconsidering the prioritisation of\ncommittee votes. One thing that this\nhas shown us is that maybe it\u2019s time\nto rethink how voting is managed at\nthe Union, if clubs regularly fall foul\nof the rules. As Stephen suggested, we\nmay even see a widening adoption of\nthe Union\u2019s e-voting by clubs, whether\nwilling or not.\nThis week we also found out about\nthe government\u2019s plan to \u201cmodernise\u201d\nthe Disabled Students Allowances\nsystem to reflect the modern age of the\ninternet and developing technologies.\nIt seems, when reading the statement\nsigned by David Willetts MP, that the\ngovernment intends to shift more\nresponsibility for aiding students\nwith disabilities to higher education\ninstitutions as opposed to shouldering\nit themselves.\nWhile universities should, and do\nprovide assistance and support to\nstudents with disabilities, when push\ncomestoshovecanwereallyguarantee\nthat an institution will be able to give\nas much financial support as the\ngovernment currently does? Especially\nconsidering the intense competition\nfor resources a university experiences,\nbetween spending on education,\nacademia, staffing, infrastructure,\naccommodation and other costs, can\nwe really be sure that every university\nwill be able to support their students\nequally, whether endowed with a large\nor small income?\nAdditionally the government\nis trying to guide HEIs towards\nproviding more implicit support, i.e.\nchanging the way courses are taught\nrather than providing direct support\nto students who need it. But where is\ntheir evidence and reasoning for these\nactions?\nFinally, on a cheerier note, we hope\neverybody had an enjoyable Easter\nvacation, well as much as it can be with\nrevision, or staying in the research\noffice while the sun is occasionally\nshining. The Summer term is short\nbut tough, so as patronising as it\nmay sound, do take care not to get to\nstressed or burned out, the end is in\nsight (at least if you\u2019re an undergrad).\nIf you have any tips on how to de-stress send us an email and you may\nend up in print!\nT\nhis week saw another\nsession of Union Council,\nthe body of elected\nrepresentatives that create\nand approve policies that\nshape the views and the functionality\nof the Union. The week saw another\ninquorate session of Council, during\nwhich the body was unable to vote\neffectively on papers due to poor\nattendance.\nWhile absences at Council are\noften due to the stress of examination\nperiods, during which (completely\nunderstandably) members are more\noccupied with their degrees than\nUnion democracy, during other times\nof the year Council often struggles\nto attract the required number of\nmembers to make 'legally-binding'\ndecisions.\nAs highlighted during this week's\nCouncil meeting, which continued\nto discuss papers despite a lack of\nquoracy, Council has several problems\nwhich potentially hinder both its\neffectiveness and ability to represent\nthe students.\nFirst of all, the fact that Council\nis often attended by the minimum\nnumber of elected representatives\nrequired for decisionmaking is\nworrying. Admittedly, some Council\nmembers (many of whom were voted\nin during last year's Big Elections)\nprobably didn't expect to attend\nCouncil as part of their role, and\nmay see it as unnecesary, however\nthese people are seen as \"the Voice\nof Students\" at the Union, and make\ndecisions on your behalf and you\ncertainly can't be represented if they\ndon't show up!\nAs a body, the Union Council is\nresponsible for passing policies that\neither affect or represent your views as\na student body, whether it's the \"Union\nStance on the Immigration Bill\",\nchanges to the Union Constitution\n& Bye-Laws, the Union's stance on\nunpaid internships or even changes to\nthe remits of the Sabbatical Officers\nwho run the Union. Additionally,\nwhile votes are only cast by Council\nmembers, any member of the Union\n(i.e. every student at College) has\nthe ability to attend, speak at or\npropose a paper at Council meetings,\nwhich gives the student body a great\nopportunity to effect the changes to\nthe Union that they feel need to be\naddressed.\nBut one question to ask is, how well\ndo the Council members represent the\npopulation? At Imperial, unlike many\nof our neighbours at the University\nof London, our Union is relatively\napolitical. Rather than running with\nleft or right-wing values candidates\noften run with a set of (often generic)\nmanifesto points. While this tends to\nfit our (often self-described) apparent\nsecular, scientific outlook as a student\nbody, aside from the agreed manifesto\npoints, when in a position of influence\ncan you really expect them to vote in a\nmanner aligned to your views?\nLast term, a paper was proposed at\nCouncil that suggested that members\u2019\nvotes were recorded and avaialble for\npublic consumption, which would be\ninteresting from a political analysis\npoint of view if one were to try to\ncategorise voters across the political\nspectrum.\nAnother issue that was pointed out\nduring the meeting was the lack of\nstudent engagement with Council, or\ndemocracy at the Union in general.\nHonestly, how many of you know\nwhat Council actually does or who\nrepresents you on Council? While\none member of staff pointed out that\nthe Union was currently undergoing\na democracy review, will the student\npopulation ever hear about the\nresults?\nAdmittedly, engaging a community\nin democracy is no mean feat,\nespecially at universities, where most\nstudents would hardly think twice\nabout Union politics, however simple\nsteps can be taken to make the general\npopulace more aware about the\n\u201cgoings on\u201d in the Union.\nThese include creating more articles\nabout Union committee activities on\nthe front page of the Union website,\nsimilar to the regular news articles\ncurrently displayed, which is probably\na better use of time than finding\nanother picture to post to the Union\ninstagram feed.\nNot to say that Council members are\nnot doing a good job, having observed\na large number of Council sessions\nit is obvious that members can often\nbe passionate about topics, with\nmeetings occasionally lasting two or\nthree hours.\nThis article was triggered by a recent\ndiscussion in Council about renewing\nthe Imperial College Union\u2019s stance on\nHigher Education.\nDuring the course of the meeting\nCouncil was informed about several\ntypes of education funding models\nand the impact they potentially may\nhave on students in terms of access\nto higher education, competition\nbetween higher education institutions\nand the number of student places\ninstitutions would have to offer.\nWhile this was the first of several\ndiscussions on the topic, one member\nof Council raised the idea that more\nstudents should be involved in the\ndiscussion of the Union\u2019s approach to\nHigher Education, rather than just the\nCouncil members, something Felix\nfundamentally agrees with.\nRather than leaving such an\nimportant decision, Felix is keen to\nhost discussion from the unelected\nstudent population, in particular\nwith views about free education, a\nperpetual tax on graduates or the\ncurrent education funding system. All\narticles are welcome and debate will\nbe encouraged.

    "content": "26 FRIDAY 02 MAY\nGAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFinal Fantasy XIV: A Social MMORPG\nI can\u2019t talk about Final Fantasy\nXIV without first talking about its\npredecessor: Final Fantasy XI, Square\nEnix\u2019s first MMORPG. Released way\nback in 2002, FFXI was an amazing\nand beautifully flawed game. I have\na bit of a love-hate relationship when\nit comes to MMOs. Of the several\nI\u2019ve played they all seem to forget\nabout the second \u201cM\u201d in their name:\nthe one that stands for multiplayer.\nSure the \u2018World\u2019 in World of Warcraft\nwas massive and yes I was online\nbut overall it felt like quite a lonely\nexperience. There was some promise\nof multiplayer content in the distant\nendgame but for the most part it was\nme, alone in the woods, hitting boars\nover the head with an axe.\nOn the other hand, the group\ncontent in FFXI was compulsory from\nincredibly early on. After only 10\nlevels hitting boars on the head with\nmy axe I was dragged to the Vulkrum\na dunes, a vast desert areas full of\nenemies that would kill me in seconds\nif I engaged them on my own. Here\nI would stand, waiting and shouting\ntrying to find five other players to\nfight with me. It was the holy trinity\nof MMOs at its most basic. A tank\n(usually me) would get the enemies\u2019\nattention and take all the hits, a healer\nwould keep his distance making\nsure I stay alive whilst everyone else\npummelled the poor goblin into\noblivion. After ten or so levels there I\u2019d\nmake the long journey to somewhere\nstronger, and then a few short levels\nlater we\u2019d move on to somewhere else.\npaladin who drags you to the Vulkrum\ndunes for the first time to show you\nthe ropes had most likely been there\nmany times before. Most players\nwere extraordinarily friendly because,\nat some point in the game they\u2019d\nbeen given help too. However, the\nincredibly social aspect of the game\nwas, at times, its worst feature. Each\ntime you went out in search of a party,\nit felt like applying for a job. With so\nmuch competition and no other way\nto level you were screwed unless you\nhad the best gear. And boy gear was\nexpensive. Before long the game itself\nfelt more of a chore than it was worth.\nSo enter FFXIV. Released in 2010,\npulled off the internet for being\nutter shite and then re-released last\nSeptember as Square\u2019s second foray\ninto MMOs. This new re-imagined\nWhat was interesting about all of this\nwas that none of it was driven by the\ngame and instead completely by the\nplayers. Sure, the game had quests like\na normal MMO but no one bothered\nwith them because the rewards were\nrubbish. Instead everything you did\nin this game was engineered by the\nplayers above you. It meant for an\nincredibly social experience albeit\nquite a restrictive one.\nThe whole thing was held together\nby the game\u2019s \u2018Job\u2019 system. Unlike\nmost MMOs where you levelled one\nclass in FFXI you levelled all of them.\nAt any point you could return home\nand switch from a burly warrior to a\nsquishy white mage beginning again\nat level 1. The game forced you to do\nthis, levelling multiple jobs over the\ncourse of the game. So the level 10\nMichael Barclay\nGames Writer\nversion of FFXIV manages to\nmaintain the social, group-focussed\naspect of FFXI whilst improving it in\nalmost every other way. As before you\ncan switch from one job to another\nbut now, this can be done at almost\nany time by simply swapping your\nmain weapon rather than making the\narduous journey home. Fighting in a\ngroup is still required to progress but\nnow this is controlled by the game\nrather than the players. Dungeons or\n\u2018instances\u2019 are nothing new to MMOs\nbut in FFIXV there are tonnes of\nthe things and they are introduced\nto the player very early on. Each\none introduces something new to\nworry about, creating one of the best\nlearning curves, not just in a MMO\nbut any game I\u2019ve ever played. Each\ndungeon sits just on the right side of\nchallenging.\nDespite all of this, the game is\nunashamedly old fashioned. To\ncounter the dominance of WOW\nother MMOs have tried the best to be\ndifferent. Age of Conan replaced the\nhotbarstyleoffightingwithsomething\nmore action oriented. Guild Wars 2,\nDC universe and many others replaced\nthe holy trinity of tank, healer and\ndamage dealer with... something else,\nand Star Wars: The Old Republic tries\nto tell a more personal story rather\nthan just repeating the same quest\nthat millions had performed before.\nYet FFXIV doesn\u2019t bother with any of\nthis fancy stuff. At a glance this really\nis a bog standard MMO but it\u2019s just\ndone so well! It\u2019s a bit ridiculous after\ngetting told how special you are and\nhow you\u2019re the best adventurer to\ngrace this land, you realise that the\nother 50 players in the room just saw\nthe exact same cutscene. Generally\nthough, the game is fun enough, and\nthe story line is good enough that I\ndon\u2019t care about this stuff and I just\nget on with it. The game is absolutely\nlittered with content. As well as the\naforementioned dungeons, there are\nprimal fights, against Final Fantasy\nstaples such as Ifrit and Odin, the\noddly named \u2018Levequests\u2019, Guildleves\nproviding daily solo and group\nchallenges when you want something\nelse to do and the server destroying\nfates where hundreds of players gang\nup together in sporadic event quests\nthat pop up randomly over the world.\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for a new\nMMO to distract you from your all-important degree, and like the idea\nof a more social game then seriously,\ngive FFXIV a try.\nUpdated Faster than Light\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor\nThis game is one of the indie scene\u2019s\nbig success stories. Back in 2012 it was\none of the most successful kickstarter\ncampaigns, achieving over 20 times the\ngoal that the developers had asked for.\nIt went on to win numerous awards,\nhas been reviewed in these very papers,\nregularly tops the steam charts and become a staple of most gamers world-wide. Furthermore, in a bid to keep\nthe game fresh, the developers have\nreleased an update, with loads of new\ncontent for free! This in itself is quite\na pleasant surprise, given that we live\nin the world of paid DLCs and micro-transactions. In addition, the creators,\nSubset Studios, have now released an\niPad version so you can be a space captain even when you are on the move!\nQuick recap: FTL is a roguelike space\nadventure, where you are the captain\nof a ship who must save the federation\nfrom the rebellion. You travel through\nthe galaxy and encounter all different\ntypes of enemies as well as several morally difficult decisions. Oh also, when\nyou die its over. You have to start all\nover again.\nThe update itself doesn\u2019t feel like it\nshould be free, that\u2019s how good it is.\nThe base game was incredibly deep,\nand even though I had more than 25\nhours on this game I never felt like I\ncould ever get every weapon or encounter every event. Therefore the\naddition of all this new content is just\namazing! An entirely new race, the\nLanus, who actually clear a room of\noxygen (making it impossible for other\nnon-Lanus crew members to be in the\nsame room) adds something completely different. Also, they look incredibly badass when they are one of your\ncrew members. The new systems that\nhave been added, like the cloning bay\n(which I liked at first, but now despise)\nand hacking drones (which are pretty\ncool!), change the game dynamics and\nallow for completely different builds\nthat suit your play style! The developers\nhave also written new events that you\ncan encounter, further expanding on\nthe replay value of this already addictive game.\nAll in all, I would say that I would\nhave paid an extra 5 pounds for this\nupdate, that\u2019s how much I liked it.\nHowever, it was free, and for that I will\neternally be grateful to Subset Studios.\nHey, Dice, Blizzard, EA: take a leaf out\nof this indie studio\u2019s book, this is how\ngames should be made!\n\n"
