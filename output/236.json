    "content": "10 FELIX GUILDS CZECH EXCHANGE by\nTi duMa ln iT his year saw the first international exchange visit organised by the\nC.&G. Union. Ten Czech students arrived in London in June for the first part of\nthe trip. The students (7 girls, 13\nboys) were led by Senior Lecturers in Civil Engineering. All efforts were made to familiaris e the Czechs with the English way of life from the very\nbeginning of the trip. The majority\nof the people had never bee n out of\ntheir country and the ones who had travelled had been only to Russia.\nTherefore this trip had very special\nsignificance.\nCzechs in\nEngland The visitors were shown around London extensively by members of\nthe College. Trips included sight-seeing, shopping, theatres and visits\nto Dubs The staff kindly co-opera t ed and showed them a great deal of\nour institution. After London the Czechs were taken to Cardiff where they saw the Steel Co. of Wales. This industrial visit was of special\ninterest to the Czechs since they were.\nall engineering students. Ex. Guilds President Dai Howell, who now works there, used his influence\nto obtain t rant la tors and after-wards tea. This was followed by a tour of the countryside\nand a beautiful day by the sea near\nthe Gower. From Wales we went to Coventry where we saw the Cathedral and Community Centre. This was followed by trips to\nStratford on Avon and Oxford University.\nGuilds goes abroad Seven of our students then went to Czechoslovakia \u2014 the trip was very\nsimilar in plan though their ideas were\na bit different. During our stay we saw a gie at deal of the country and met very many students \u2014 we saw some very interesting plays using rather advanced drama techniques\nwhich to the best of our knowledge had not reached London. It is very diff cult to accurately assess the significance of such an ex change However, it did almost\nachieve what we set out to do. In fact, it did mean a great deal in terms of personal friendships members of our group established. We did get the unique opportunity of\nseeing the Communist community at\nwork and play. Language diff cult i ee were enormous and certainly made a lot of difference in the standard of\nintellectual conversation. What we disco ve ie don the whole was that the\nCzechs were friendly people, but lacked humour. This is something\nwhich we hope we gave them individually and certainly as a group.\nIam certain that we made more\nfriends than enemies.\nI have bee n asked a great deal\nabout future trips and the costs of\n'he se visits. On this my opinion is\npurely personal. These exchanges are\ninvaluable; but either a) learn their\nlanguage, orb) go to countries where\nEnglish is spoken e.g. Scandinavia an a U.S.A. Finance \u2014 the trip can cost a great deal \u2014 we contributed\npersonally for the visit and I think we could slightly increase this contribution, and also get more help\nfrom Industry. Finally, these trips\nought to have a definite timetable\nprinted well ahead of the trip, discussed and agreed by the two Universities involved. Iam fully in favour of such visits provided the\nfinancial burden be shifted from the\nUnion to Inunstry.\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the Ex President and members of the ex change, I would like to, thank C and G Union. Central ian s,I.C. Union for their kind help and trust in us to\ncarry through the first, and I hope\nnot the last, exchange with a foreign\nUniversity.\nWOW SHOWING\nFOR A SEASON\nASTORIA CHARING CROSS ROAD;\nTel.

    "content": "2 FELIX\nGeneral Studies: THE TWO CULTURES' Leonardo da Vinci On Tuesday18 October' in the General Studies course \" The Two Cultures\" the Rev. Gordon Phillips,\nSenior Chaplain to the University, Rave the record of his discourses on Leonardo da Vinci. He set out and. in his own brilliant way, succeeded\nto give the most important events in the life of Leona ido and to connect\nthese events with aspects of this most\ninteresting personality.\nLeonardo recieve cl only a basic\neducation, first in the peasant home of his mother and then later in the more luxurious Florentine home of\nhis father. He spent his apprenticeship with Ver ric cho where his stv le of ' over neat\" paintings and sexless\nsubie ct s emerged.\nIt was at this time that he was cha reed with, and cleared of sodom v.An other event of this period which, according to Mr. Phillips, obsessed\nhim was the sight of am nn suiter mg from the effects of lynching. From Florence Leonardo went to Milan where he made his name as a lute\nplayer, doing little painting but de signing a number of buildings including a brothel with concealed doors,\nfor embarrassed customers, and a stable with an automatic feeding\nsystem.\nThis period also brought a number of designs for machines which had many usefuL access pries, but he did not find a practical means to propel them. These included a50t on\" hand powered\" tank, a steam cannon and wings for men,. Before leaving Milan he painted the famous \"last supper\". His method was to work for periods up to24 hours without stopping for food or rest and then to work on something\nelse before his next stint days later.\nAfter Tynan, Gascoigne, Gilliatt...\nRonald\nBryden\nWhy? How? What's it like?\nRONALD BRYDEN was born in Trinidad and went to school in Canada. He produced shows there. When his college\nput on1066 And All That he played the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Do we have here the first, distant stirrings . . . ?\nCambridge. Bryde n was at Cambridge from1951 to1955, where incidentally he wrote theatre notices for the Cambridge Review. When he went down he wrote for The Spectator, moved on to become the New Statesman' s dramatic critic. It was the success of his work here \u2014\nintelligent, witty, literary \u2014 that led to his being chosen by The Observer. Full marks for homework. Being The Observer's theatre\ncritic is hard work. He has to see a lot of plays, obviously. It takes research. Bryde n was the only London critic to find,\nthen read, a copy of Lope de Vega's La Fianza Satisfecha,\nthe original of Osborne' s A Bond Honoured. ( The Guardian had started a rumour that it didn't exist.)\nStill not bored. After more than1,000 plays Bryde n has still\nnot been bored. Whatever the reason for this, it seems to result in not being boring. Read him in The Observer every\nSunday. You may agree.\nHe then travelled to Mun tua be fore returning to Florence. There, as\nwell as painting and designing, he researched into the natural world. He began by di sect ing and drawing of human bodies, and then he\" progressed\" to examining the animal and botanical worlds. He continued his work until his death on May21519 after .a stroke.\nThe conclusions drawn by Mr. Phillips were that Leonardo was brilliant but odd. He mostly painted the natural, the old, the innocent or the horrific. He had unusual views\non sex, with his painting of sexless\nmadonnas and statements that sex was\nbeneath man and had an ability\nto unite \" mirror writing\" exemplified\nin his7,000 pages of notes, the original source of most of this in formation.\nEBULLIENT\nMINES\n67% of Minesmen turned out to\nwelcome Chris Molam and his Executive back to college for what looks\nlike being the best year EVER for\nMines.\nMola m managed to bulldoze his\nway through the more important\nbusiness of the meeting, despite the\nlight-hearted efforts to dive;', the attention of the masses by the Entertainments officer and his motley crew.\nLapel b ages, with Mines crests,\nwe being ordered and should be avail ably by Christmas. Th ii d year\nand' P.G. students were invited to bec ome Associate members of the R SMA and as such they would en joy the full advantages of the R SMA. The financial situation of Mines*_ ni on is still healthy; assets now t; tal \u00a3 3 0 0 . In the opinion of the Senior Treasurer they could have\namounted to \u00a3 4 0 0 had it not been for overspending by the Rugby Club and generous gifts to 'ambassadors'\nwho visited foreign mining schools\non behalf of RS M. The Rugby Club was reprimanded by the Treasurer\nfor the slipshod way in which they\nhandled their finances.\nThe IF MM S congress (reported in JAZZ\nBENNY\nGREEN\nSuch is the drawing power of Benny Green that two or three hun dred people gathered in Me chEng recently to hear the first talk in his General Studies lecture on\" Aspects\nof Jazz.\" In this talk Green examined the\nmusic of the contemporary players,\nLouis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbeche, and compared the differences\nin their music with the differences in their environments. Whereas Louis is the epitome of the negro jazz man, having dragged himself up from poverty to the pinnacle of acclaim as\na trumpet player, Bix was the middle-class whiteman who\" made\ngood\"' in the Jazz world and, as\nBenny Green demonstrated with re cords, this difference in class and upbringing is reflected in their music.\nAs boys, both were musically advanced although in different directions. Louis was born with jazz in his soul, while Bix's music was initially guided along most \" respectable \" lines. The social pressure of the day prevented Beiderbeche from playing in public with the better\nmusicians of the period, who were\nmainly negro, so his records are, as\nBenny lOre en said, \" indifferent {re-cording s with one redeeming feature\n\u2014 Bix Beiderbeche.\" One the other\nhand, Armstrong was able to record\nwith top-class jazz-men, an uncommon example of social inequality.\nBut, after hours, the two frequently\nplayed together and such was their\nmutual respect that Bix called Louis\" the greatest trumpeter that ever\nlived,\" while Louis called Bix\" the\ngre a jest trumpeter that ever lived.\" However, while Armstrong' s forte\nwas improvisation, Beiderbeche had a strong sense of harmonic values and towards the end of his short life was\nexperimenting and trying to bridge the\ngap between jazz and classical music, with little success. Armstrong has now expanded his horizons and become perhaps more of an entertainer\nthan a jazz musician. So, Bix Beiderbeche died early of harmonic insecurity; Louis Armstrong entertains on, and Benny Green will undoubtedly return to play out his\nseries of lectures to the same applause\nas he started them.\nThe first ' Mines Night' of this session will be the evening of Morphy FELIX\" at \"the end^ fk rt' tenn Ph SJ*****?

At the time, last Monday evening, he was addressing a well attended meeting of the SocS oc on the topic of\" Student Politics at I.C.\"He spoke profusely on how the\nstudent politician( as opposed to the clowning, beer swilling union official) could make himself most\neffective in the union. He did, however, emphasise that some clowning was necessary for some people\nwere actually bored by long dissertations on politics.\nHe regretted that so many students\nat I.C. seemed unaware and uninterested in what was happening politically on a nationwide basis. They were interested only in what affected\npossessed a great deal of power in the\nUnion seemed to escape them.\nHe was particularly critical of the\npolitical societies at I.C. They were\nalways talking, he said, but never\nreally doing anything. ( He gave this\nas his reason for leaving SocS oc some years ago.)\nIt also transpired in the course of his talk that he is in favour of I.C. joining N.U.S. and of a truly democratic election of the president of I.C. The meeting then closed after the\nelection of three new committee members. There was a special committee\nmeeting held afterwards to decide\nwhat action should be taken in support of Battersea Soc. Soc., which has\nbeen closed down after some dubious man oe uv ring by the president of Battersea Union.

Eighteen people, mostly Freshers, sailed in four races during the morning, and showed great promise. The standard of racing was unusually high for such an event, and there appeared to be noone who had not raced previously\u2014\u2022\nthough some were hampered by unfamiliarity with Fireflies and the\" Harp.\" Team racing practices will be held on Saturdays, and the club hopes to be\nable to field some very strong teams.\nSailing lessons for novices will be held on Wednesdays, thus giving the\nclub even more talent, in the future.

C.40. This was the first game of the season, and as\ntraining matches were only ten minutes each way, the tiredness was not sum r is mg. Though the game was somewhat untidy, the victory was very worthwhile. To combat the lack of fitness, the intensity of training it to be doubled, and coupled with the arrival of several\npromising fresh e is, the season should\nbe quite successful.

U. Cup Competition.\nThe difference between the two teams was only apparent in fitness,\nfoot bu ii wise neither had anything to offer \u2014 when the teams tried ten goals\nwere scored in forty minutes, including fifteen minutes of blind mans\nbull in near darkness.\nThe game started oft in a scrappy fashion, and continued in a similar\nvein foi the first hour; the only real -iit'or ts, for I.C., coming from Taylor, at half hack. Northern Polytechnic opened the scoring when slack marking by the l.C. defence allowed on' inside forward to scramble to ball home.\nThe exhausted state of the opposition slowly began to show in the second half, as I.C. gradually began to predominate. Eventually flashes of\nability from East ell produced three goals in as many minutes, putting I.C. in the lead. The third goal, from thirty yards, bulged the back of the net\nbefore the keeper had moved. It said much for the courage of the Northern Poly team that in the last\nfour minutes they came back from near defeat and forced I.C. to extra\ntime. The college defence was again easily pierced and the match entered\na half hour extra time with the score three all. The gallant Northern team could not summon up the reserves of energy\nof spirit to beat their superiors in fitness, and I.C. scored four mors gci il s in extra time, coming fr em Hopwood, East ell and Squire, to the opponent's one.\nI.C. will indeed be relieved to get through this round after coming so\nc'f we to ignominious defeat. Firmer control is needed in midfield, b v the wing halves and inside forwards \u2014 someone with the ability to read the game wo ul H be welcome. The fighting spirit and the will to win at all cost is necessary in every\ngame, when I.

The combination of an original\npresentation of Folk Music seasoned\nby traditional Irish wit, produced\nsplendid entertainment for the Club.\nMartin Beer, a new member of the\nFolk Club introduced the evening,\nfollowed by an older resident. Steve\nGrant, whose songs varied from the\nunaccompanied traditional to those of\nDerek Hall. Unabashed by their lack\nof numbers, the McPeake family continued until the interval. An Irish\nharp and Killien pipes\u2014a form of\nIrish bagpipes played with bellows and operated by the elbow\u2014produced a novel sound for two instrumental,\nwhile cui tar and bani o were used to\naccompany traditional songs.\nLocai College talent resumed the\nevening after the interval. The While\nCity Ramblers moved through some\nwell known melodies, followed by\nIvor Grayson-Smith, in good form\nafter his illness. Sheila Henrywood\nand Steve Grant.\nThe McPeake family returned to\ncomplete the evening; their repertoire\nextended by tin-whistle and bones (a traditional form of spoons). Both\ntheir traditional songs and instrumental produced loud applause, to the extent that the end of their performance\nwas protracted by overwhelming en-cores.\nAn excellent start to the term was\nun doubt ably produced for the Folk\nClub.

    "content": "FELIX it UeA4 to FELIX\nSTUDENTS: FAIR REN TS\nSir,\nAt the first R.C.S. Union meeting this session a motion was passed,\nthat \" all students\" in flats should ap ply to the rent tribunal. It was said\nthat this would produce a pool of\nlow fixed rents.\nI believe that this will not happen, because students form too\nsmall a proportion of the flat-dwelling\npopulation of London. It would be naive for a student\nbody to try and force rents down when it is in such a minority. The only effect of such a move would be\nto create a\" student bar\" making it\nimpossible for students to find flats\nat all. Landlords and their estate-agents would soon notice that flats\nrented to students were being considered by the Rent Tribunal. The estate-agents would be unwilling to\nsend client such tenants and would veto all students.\nIf a student feels that his rent is\nexcessive he could apply individually to the tribunal. A register of rents\nfixed in the area is open for inspection at the local authorities offices, so\nit is easy to check if an application is worthwhile. A tenant is given six\nmonths security of tenure, after t lie tribunal's decision, after which time\nthe tenant can apply for a next ens ion. The tribunal can limit the security to as little as seven days and even if a longer period is granted\nthe landlord can apply to have it\nreduced if the tenants' behaviour has\nbeen unsatisfactory. For example, if\nhe has not complied with the terms\nof his contract.\nIt seems a pity that when London colleges are expanded little or no\ngovernment money is directed to wards student accommodation. S.E.B ames WE won? Sir,\nIn view of the statement apparent-ly made at the last Guilds Union Meeting and also in the almost non existent IC Union Handbook to the\neffect that Guilds were the winners\nof the ' towpath' event at Morphy Day last year, I would be pleased if you could allow me to make use of your\ncolumns to state that in fact RCS were in posse sion of the push ball for the whole of the event except\nthe first ten minutes and thus there\nis no question but that they and not\nGuilds were the winners.\nR.D. lames Carnival mess\nSir,\n1 should strongly like to recommend to whoever was in charge of\nthe Carnival squad on Saturday the22 nd October that, if it is absolutely\nnecessary to use the tennis courts for\ncleaning bill-boards on, that in future he comes to some arrangement with the tennis captain over\nreserving the courts in Princes\nGardens. As I believe these boards\nwere being taken over to the\nChemistry Dept. Might I suggest\nthey be cleaned on the car park\nwhich, is relatively free on Saturdays\nand where the mess created would be free to run into the public drains.\nI believe the Chemistry Dept. has\nrunning water so that the hose\nwould pose no problem. R.P. Ibbitt\nAddenda Sir,\nYou are publishing an advertisement on the Vietnam war today. On a recent visit to the United States,\nI heard of 60 US Congressmen or\nSenators who have pledged support\nfor the policy of withdrawal of' US troops. Senator Morse is the best\nknow among them. A mother whose\nson was fighting in Viet am and who carried a sticker in her car reading\n'Support the Fighting men in Vietnam revealed to me that whilst out-ward ly she wat s all support given to\nthe American Commitment, at the\nballot box she would vote for a policy advocated by the above60. Peace can only come by political action and this makes the advertising\nyou have published so important.\nPaul Eisen k lamAS IN THE PAST the Editor will be\npleased to receive letters for publica-tion. However, the right to with old from such letters, either in part or\nin toto, is reserved.\nMIKE damaged\nSir,\nOn the evening of Wednesday26 th October certain members of the Union saw fit to tamper with the uncompleted micrometer MIKE on its plinth in the lower Union lounge. In spite\nof a notice to the effect that it was un finished they thought it would be\nclever to dismantle part of it and leave most of the pieces as evidence\nof their supreme intelligence. I personally had never thought that even\nstudents of fC would sink so low as to damage their own mascot.\nIt has made it apparent to me that\nMIKE needs protecting more from the\nlower, drunken elements of fCU than from any external college, ft has also\nmade me doubt whether the effort put\ninto this project by so many people\nwas really worthwhile, or rather\nwhether the students of IC are worthy of it. R.N. Conforth.\n5\nIn defence\nSir,\nNot only rubbish, but anonymous\nrubbish! It could not possibly be\nconsidered the responsibility of Jim Murray or Brian Compton to have\ncontinued the arrangement of the\nFreshers' hop. On failing their exams\n\u2014 which failure can be largely attributed to their wholehearted efforts\nfor IC Union all last year \u2014 they presumably had jobs to take up, which, even if in London, would pre sum ably occupy their whole working day. Further, Col cut t's implication that\nUnion officials were not notified in\nadvance of their absence during the\ncoming session appears to be erroneous as I saw Jim Murray in the\nUnion buildings over a week before\nhe start of term.\nTo use his (her?)own words, it is\ntypical of the malaise that runs\nthrough much of Col cut t that a large\npart of his comment should be devote d to sleigh ting two of the Union's hardest workers who are not now in a position to reply.\nRoderick J. Red may neEd.; Mr. Red may ne has requested\nthat' On failing their exams' be\namended to On failing to return .\nA CAREER IN\nModern developments in the Generating Board such as Advanced Gas Cooled\nReactors and the 400 kV transmission super grid require graduates of the highest\ncalibre.

    "content": "2 FELIX FELIK WEEKEND\nDEADLINE\nCARNIVAL WEEK\nPOP CONCERT?\nProfessor Sir Willis Jackson\nJackson Committee\non manpower\nBy1908 it is predicted that for the\nfirst time in recent history, the\nnumber of scientists required in Britain will be greater than the\nnumber of engineers. This is one of\nthe conclusions of the Jackson Committee report on Manpower Resources which was published recently.\nThe committee was reporting a comprehensive survey of the deployment of technically qualified people.\nThe committee, which was headed\nby Professor Sir Will is Jackson, Head of E iec. Eng., also produced the first\nstudy of tire employment of technical\nsupporting staff.\nThe figures for 1968 are based on\nthe results of enquiries made to industry on their requirements and are,\nas \u00bbuch, only estimates. The output\nof scientists from universities for that\nyear would have to be 14,000 while12,000 engineering graduates are required. This is 2 4 % in excess of the\nforeseeable numbers and could only\nbe met by redeployment from other\nsectors.\nAnother revealing fact produced\nin the report is that although during the period 1963-66, there has been an\nincrease of 3 5 % in the numbers of\nengineers employed in teaching at\nuniversity level, at school level,\nwhere students are choosing their\ncareers, there has been only a5% increase in the number of engineers\nemployed.\nOn the same day, the Swann Commit ee Report on Manpower Para meters showed that from the 4,000\nengineers and9.000 sei ent is ts who graduated in 1965. 19.6\"', of the\nengineers and34.2% of the scientists\nwent on to IlighiT studies and re-search. 5 . 1 % of the scientists left the\ncountry, as did5.9% of the engineers.\nTii e committee, of which Professor M.M. Swann, Principal of\nEdinburgh University, was chairman, criticised the present system in which the \"student tends to enter university already convinced that research\nis the goal worth setting his heart\non\". It was this view wh ic'i Professor Lai thwaite attacked at a recent\nmeeting of the Eng. Soc. In his\nopinion graduates needed for re search were being lost to industry\nwhere their talents were wasted.\nJackson Committee Report on Manpower Resources for Science and Technology H.M.S. O.5/6d.

SCRUTINY'\nWOUND\nUP\nAt the Social Clubs Committee meeting on October 25th, it was decided to wind up SCRUTINY, the\nCommittee's magazine. The reason\ngiven for this was that it was im possible to obtain sufficient advertising : it was suggested that the literary\ngeniuses of S. C.C. should apply their\ntalents to PHOENIX, which at the\nmoment has no editor to accept or\nreject their efforts. Apparently PHOENIX has plenty of advertising\nbut \" could use more cn]>\\ ' in view\nof these facts, the motion to wind up\nSCRUTINY was passed by a considerable majority.\nPublished by C.G.

This year's Carnival Board intends\nto hold a\" gigantic concert\" next\nMarch, in the Albert Hall, ler ry Stockbridge, the Carnival Coordinator has contacted the manager of the\nhall and is confident that the proposal is practicable. If this were to come off. Carnival would have the choice\nof either a concert of classical music which involves hiring an orchestra\nand charging high ticket prices or a pop concert which would certainly\nattract more students but would need\ninsurance and extra staffing if a big name group were obtained. Acc or ding to estimates supplied by the\nR.A.H., a pop concert might produce\ntakings of \u00a32,400 at normal prices \u2014\ni.e. maximum of1 guinea. It is hoped\nthat the concert will be held in early\nMarch. Carnival Week will be May6 \u2014 1 3 ,\nthe possibility of holding it in March was discussed\u2014a FELIX survey, last\nyear, showed that the end of the Ea ster Term was the most popular period for Carnival \u2014 but this has been r ejected in view of the present policy to extend Carnival over the whole year and use Carnival Week as the\nlast fling before exams. In keeping with this policy it was proposed that\nfilm shows, concerts, etc., be held in March and the Easter term in general\nwhile still retaining important events\nsuch as the Carnival Hop and the\nfe te until. May. It is unlikely that a Carnival Profession will be allowed this year as a result of a bye-law forbidding processions.\nWELLS SOC:\nCOSMOLOGY\nLooking at the stars without a telescope! Professor Bondi in his lecture to Wells Soc. presented and explained some of the basic th ones Oi t lio Universe.\nSpeaking to a very large audience,\nhe showed how from a few classic-al physics' concepts the modern model of the Universe is built up: how the elements were formed and why their natural distribution is as\nit is. The concept of time as seen\nby classical physics (time is reversible) and as seen by thermodynamics\n(time not reversible) and how these\nconcepts fit into the picture of the\nUniverse as we see it; the reason\nwhy a gyroscope keeps a set position\nwith respect to the distant stars and how it is postulated that the distant\nstars are moving away from us at a speed proportional to their distance.\nTHE POOR ATTENDANCE at this\nyear's Safety Lecture was extremely\ndisappointing, only about fifty of all the undergraduates, postgraduates,\ntechnicians and staff of the college\nbothering to attend. Even despite\nthe poor publicity, considering\nthe the fact that the workshops and laboratories of the college contain no fewer dangers than a modern factory,\na greater attendance would have been\nexpected.\nThe lecture, entitled \" Seeing the\nRisk,\" was given by Dr. R.B. Buzzard, who said that most acc idents are cause by lapses in concentration and not by slow reflexes as\nhad once been thought. Extremes of on behalf of the FELIX BOARD, by WEST LONDON OFFSET CO..,V.6( tel. FUL7%9). Phil Marshall, VicePresident of Guilds, is trying to organise an auction to be held in the Union. He wants articles such as cars, tape-re-c orders, record-players, in fact, anything of reasonable value. The aim is\nto sell the articles \u2014 if necessary with a reserve price \u2014 for the students. Carnival taking a percentage as commission for the service. Contact him at\nGuilds Union Office orI. C.Rack. OSS\nWEEKEND\nPROJECT\nA nO.S.S working party recently\ncompletely redecorated one room of an elderly couple's flat. This was the\nfirst weekend project carried out by\nO.S.S., the newly formed college society which arranged for bands of volunteers to undertake projects in the Kensington and Notting Hill areas.\nThe project arose in a fairly typical way. The need for re decoration, with its attendant boost to morale, was first noticed by an organisation for social work, and they passed the request on to O.S.S. The Ministry of Social Security provided the necessary equipment and materials and everyone concerned gave their services\nfree.\nSimilar projects will continue\nthrough the session and anyone wish ing td offer his or her services will be\nwelcome. As projects are arranged,\nlists to be signed by volunteers will appear on the O.S.S. notice board, which may be fond at boot level\nnear the lower refectory. South Side.\nYou can help O.S.S. to help others\nby being involved yourself.\nIn reply to a question on the idea\nof an expanding Universe, he said\nthis was really a misnomer. It is\ntrue that the distant stars are receding at tremendous speeds but not\ninto avoid. This would contradict\none of the basic ideas of the Universe which states that it is completely\nuniform. This shows how difficult it\nis to picture the modem idea of the\nUniverse.\nHowever, Professor Bondi was extremely clear in his presentation of the complex ideas lie hind modem cosmology which led to a stimulating\ndiscussion after his lecture.\nheat or cold and even prolonged constancy of temperature are likely to\ncause concentration to flag and in crease the likelihood of accidents.\nHowever, in many cases, machinery\ncan be built to concentrate the attention of the operator on important instruments or on dangerous parts of the machinery to help stop the mind wandering from them.\nMuch work remains to be done on\nthe subject, which is increasingly\nmore important as more complex\nmachinery is introduced into industry,\nbut at any rate, as Dr. Buzzard in formed us I.C. has a safety record to\nbe proud of( despite the attendance\nat his lecture).\nSEEING THE RISK\n\n"

What do we want from Union life? Are we to be all poker faced, serious'-minded intellectuals\nshouldering the cares of the College,\nthe country and the cosmos? Or should we disregard our responsibilities and enjoy our freedom in drinking and rough-houses?\nIn the last few weeks there have\nbeen several \" incidents \" created by inebriated members who are out for some fun. On one occasion following an RCS Freshers' Dinner a Theta bearer had his room ransacked by Mines men \u2014 no serious damage was done and noone was harmed but it was\nan ugly situation for a few minutes.\nOn9 November comes Morphy Day, that \" traditional\" day for mock fighting and general horseplay. This is an excellent opportunity for all boisterousness to be run off and directed into harmless channels.\n' . . \"clean up Freshers' Dinners\"\nbe the result?\u2014as Col cut t points out a new Rector or the Senior Warden might decide to take matters into his own most capable, most resp on si b'e, most restricting hands.\nSo why prescribe the limits of Union behaviour too strictly; isolated\n\" incidents \" will happen and it would take a restrictive policy to stamp\nthem out completely. Let us leave it to Col cut t to slam whoever deserves\nslamming and allow the Union to\ncontinue its training process.\nShameful !\nOur 'image'\nThe\" sporting \" events area common feature of Union life and why should there not be some levity, some\nhorseplay among undergraduates?\nThe products of a University: doctors,\nlawyers, scientists, chartered engineers\nare respected members of society, responsible, dependent members of a world which is less kind than the\nprincipality of South Ken. The under.-graduate life is the ideal situation to\nlearn responsibility by trial and error \u2014 if you get drunk, who worries?\nBetter to err now than learn the hard\nway in the outside world; the College is your training ground.\nHowever let us not forget our public image. A Union of unreliable,\nirresponsible drunks could not work for long and would not be permitted\nfor long. This sporting life can be\nextremely enjoyable for all concerned\nbut should its consequences be inflicted on the general public? Is it necessary to litter the pavements with broken glass, hold a toll-gate across\nExhibition Road in the rush-hour or\nattempt to play football in Ken High Street? This kind of levity brings\ncrit is c is m of the College, not specifically the Union, and what might\"... indebted to him all their lives \"\nwas the phrase used by Lord Florey at the Memorial Service to describing the respect and gratitude due to the\nlate Rector. Yet less than fifty students turned up apart from those invited individually. The service was widely publicised on College and Union notice boards. The last lecture of the morning was cancelled so\nthat undergraduates could attend\nwithout missing studies. It says much for the responsibility of the students\nthat less than 2 per cent of the undergraduates made the effort to attend ;\nperhaps we are too complacent, too ready to accept our good fortune,\nwhich is due to the efforts of the late\nRector \u2014 or simply too lazy. INTERESTED IN: QUOTATIONS\nQUIZZES\nQUAKERS\nThen come to the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\n13 Princes Gardens\nfor a book about it. Open117 pm. daily (11-5.30)\nMonday& Wednesday COL CL With the Board of Governors of IC no doubt deliberating on if ie appoint ment of a successor to Sir Patrick L instead, it might be as well to take a quick look at the recent events at LSE which have hit the headlines. LSE Union, home of such lost causes as C ND from time immemorial, has given an ultimatum to the Director-designate of LSE, Dr. Walter Adams, demanding that he answer certain charges laid against him by an extremist ( and judging from their pamphlet, inarticulate) group of students. If Dr. Adam's answers are unsatisfactory, then the Union will oppose his appointment.\nSeveral points of interest arise from this situation. First, the Union meeting condemning Dr. Adams appears to have been badly conducted, allowing virtually no defence of his reputation. Second, the charges made against him( tolerance of Government oppression of academic freedom, isolation from students and staff, inefficiency and indecision) are all very poorly substantiated\nand most probably totally untrue. His past history clearly shows him to be a champion of academic freedom and the very apotheosis of a racialist.\nBesides, in that great bastion of freedom of political thought, is an academic\nappointment to be opposed on political grounds ? The charges of isolation from students and staff are based on an unpublished report, the author of which was very quick to dissociate himself from the happenings at LSE. As regards, in decision or inefficiency, surely the Board of Governors are in a \u00a3ar better position to judge Dr. Adams' personal qualities as an admin is tra tor than the long haired, weir die troublemakers of LSE Union. This brings me to the third and final point \u2014 especially relevant to IC at the\nmoment. The appointment of Director of LSE as of Rector of IC is a matter\nfor the Board of Governors to decide, and, whilst in the case of controversial\nappointments, no doubt a reasoned Union view would be listened to, the\nUnion has no part to play in the decision making, and should have none.\nQuite apart from the fact that the Board is in a far better position to judge\npotential nominees, academic appointments are quite simply outside the realm of the Union's job. Imagine the fur ore if the Board attempted to veto the\nelection of a particular Union President. As Lord Bridges, Chairman of the\nLSE Board, wrote to \" The Times\" a week ago, it is \" . . . neither necessary,\nnor indeed proper, that any reply should be made by LSE....\" The power\nof LSE Union has been immeasurably weakened by this hysterical outburst.\nLet us hope that IC is a little more grownup than its baby sister in Houghton Street.\nThe letter published jn this issue from Roar erRed may ne is typical of several complaints I have heard about my last article. I did not imply that Union officials were unaware of Murray and Compton s' failure to return, and I agree.\nMurray was about College just prior to this term, but as regards Ents., he seems to have been less than helpful, as apparently neither the Exec, nor Keith Guy were given any indication of what has been done and what has not. Minutes, books did not appear to exist. I agree that both Murray and Compton did a lot of good work last year, but to say because of this they are above\ncriticism is anal ago us to saying that because theN. C.B. does a good job in general, minor incidents such as Aberfan maybe overlooked. If Mr. Red may ne, bless him, is unable to decide whether Iam him or her, why can't he be like everyone else and just say \" it.\" I was told the other day that R. Hay fork and His Wooden Spoon Club are making Guilds a new, lightweight Mini spanner. \u20ac 9\nSome Other GUYS IN THE LAST ISSUE of FELIX an article was published de sri bing the running of the Freshers' Hop and this contained references to Mr. Jim Murray, ex Chairman of Ets. Committee. In particular it was stated\nthat the bass-guitarist and the singer\nof the group 'Some Other Guys' were personally connected with Mr. Murray. Mr. Murray emphatically denies any such connection. It was also stated in several places that Mr. Murray had failed his Final exams;\nin fact he obtained' his ARCS and merely failed to return to the College and take up his appointment as\nCarnival Organiser.\nThe article was based on in form a tion obtained from responsible and supposedly reliable sources and in ignorance of the facts stated by Mr. Murray.

The celebration, held in the Royal Albert Hall, began with the colourful entrance of the student\nPresidents, Readers, and Wardens, Professors and the principal officers\nof the Governing Body. The procession was effectively performed to a background of ' Gaude amu sig it ur' sung by the IC Musical Society\nChoir. A nun programmed event was a brief speech by Lord Sherfield,\nChairman of the Governing Body, of\nthe regret of the College at the death\nof the late Rector. He spoke of the\nmoving address by Lord Florey at\nthe Memorial Service and of the\ntributes in the Press. The College, he said, has lost a sympathetic administrator, the University a staunch\nmember and all who have come in to contact with hind have lost a good friend.\nDeputy President David McBain was the Student Orator and gave a dignified rendering of the Opening Proclamation. The reading was followed by the\npresentation of Associateships and Diplomat es to an accompaniment by the orchestra, the orchestra winning by several lengths. Lastly the six\nnew Fellows were presented with their Parchments by Lord Sherfield.\nThe Address\nThe Special Visitor's, Address followed' T lie Clerk of Oxen ford' from the Canterbury Pilgrims by Geoffrey\nChaucer and sung by the Choir. Lord Beeching's Speech touched on one of the vital issues one might have expected from such a dist ingui shed industrialist. Its content\nwas much more relevant to IC and quite uncontroversial Lord Beeching, who is a Diplomat e of IC, devoted\nthe first quarter of his Address to an explanation of how he had changed since leaving the College. He justified this as a warning, that, as an\nobserver and commentator \" Iam biased by my own particular experiences\". Moving on to his main subject he postulated the average graduate\nstarting out ' pursuing a career...\nwithin the confines of (his) own speciality'. Then later in life find-ing himself 'increasingly interested\nin adjacent fields of knowledge, un til eventually he is 'likely to take\ninterest in the overall effectiveness\nwith which science and technology\nis applied within our social and economic structure.' iV is led him to a visual representation of the distribution of science\ngraduates and social science and arts graduates in 'the jobs... filled by\nwell educated men'. The diagram was difficult to follow but by care-:\nful consideration it can be seen to\n| represent the situation. He described\n1\na rectangular display in which \"scientists\" are represented by black\nspots and \"artists\" by crosses, while those job filled by none graduates are\nmarked with circles, \u00ab| Moving across\nthe diagram from left to right the sci et if ic content of the jobs in crea s es, climbing up the diagram the\norganisation level and degree of influence increase. Lord Beeching concluded that black spots would congregate in the lower left corner and spread upwards more or less ver tic ally; the crosses would be spread\nacross the- lower right hand side but these move sideways as they rose.\n' At the very top levels of the diagram,| representing the levels of most\n| powerful and widespread influence,\nwe se a lot of c irc r 'es, a lot of cro s ses, but very few black spots'.\nOur fault\nHe expressed regret at the situation\nbut pointed out that it is partly the\n\"scientists\" fault and arises from a viscous circle which we can do much to break. There is an opinion, he\nsaid, that \"scientists\" are less versatile than \"artists\" and the conclusion\nwas drawn that this is due to inability. In fact it is a result of the excessive demand/ supply ratio and the\nrelative qualities of arts and science\nteachers. The graduate of \"science\"\nis less rounded than an\" arts\" man. It is our job, he concluded, to\nthink of ourselves 'as highly intel-li get, which you are; as well educated people, which you should be; and never hesitate to broaden your ex-peri en ce'. The two hour ceremony finished\nwith the Choir leading the Assembly in ' God Save The Queen'. Lord Beeching giving his address on Thursday. Memorial Serviceglowing tribute\nLord Florey paid slowing tribute to Sir Patrick I. instead in his address\nat the Memorial Service for the late Rector. The College had lost this dedicated and sympathetic person at the height of his powers. In a period when\nmost had a dread of being incompetent he stood out and determined that\nwe should not fail. Following his appointment as\nRector in 1955, he became involved in discussions at Government level on\neducation and research. From then\non he devoted the finest years of his\nlife to the College and it is due to\nhis great administrative ability that\nthe College owes it present position.\nIts students will have cause to be\ngrateful to him all their lives.\nTo achieve a sufficient, control over\nthe College, another man might have\nbeen ruthlessly efficient, but under Sir\nPatrick one sensed a happy atmosphere about the College. It was\nalways his aim that although the\nprincipal task was to produce scientists, the products should be\n\" rounded \" scientists.\nLord Florey pointed out that Sir Patrick was a vcr v human person and\nenjoyed his homed if e. Without the\ngreat help given by Lady Linstead the\nsuccess would not have been achieved.\nAt the Royal Society Sir Patrick\nand Lord Florey worked together ; on Lord Flottjy's election to President he\nwas to iJ lie was luck) to have Sir\nPatrick there to keep him straight. In\njudgement and action he was superb\nand made a delightful colleague.\nLord Florey ended with the reminder\nthat Sir Patrick Linstead was a scientist of great distinction and a splendid friend. Lord Flory. who is Provost of\nQueens College, Oxford, was a great\nfriend of the late Rector and the\nemotion he felt at the loss was readily\ndiscernible in his speech.\nAmong the many distinguished visitors present with Lady Linstead were\nmembers of the Governing Board; Lordi Sherfield. Sir Charles\nCunningham, Dr. D.H. Follet. Lord Stamp : also present were The Mayor of Kensington and Chelsea, the Lord Mayor of Westminster, Sir Edmond and Lady Playfair, Sir Solly and Lady Zuckerman; and in. ic.J a veritable\nhost of dignitaries. They were seated\nin the nave with the senior members\nof the\" Union. The service was simple and lasted\nonly half an hour. The lesson w nas read by President Tony Duke and this\nprogressed after prayers led by the\nRev. Cleverly Ford, to Lord Florey's address. The blessing v, js given by\nthe Bishop of London and the l.C. choir then sang.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 3\nFAIR\nRENTS\nFOR\nRCS Last Thursday R. CJS. became\nthe twenty-first Student Union to\nrealise that the Rent Acts can\nhelp students just as much as\nother tenants.\nBriefly, all rents of unfurnished flats\nare now frozen until a\" Fair Rent\" has been fixed.\nPremiums, Key money and excessive charges for fixtures and fittings\nare now illegal.\nAs a tenant, you can apply to your local Fair Rents Officer for your rent\nto be reduced. If you or your landlord do not like his judgement, your rent goes to the Rent Assessment\nCommit tte. This hears both sides and then fixes the rent for three years, at a fair level.\nScarcity is not considered as a fac-tor. Only the accommodation itself\nis valued. So if your rent is artificially high because you're in an\" ex>-pensive area\" it will probably be\ngreatly reduced.\nFurnished tenants can go to the local Furnished Rent Tribunal. You get six months security automatically \u2014 even if you are under notice to quit.\nThis is also the place to go if you are in digs.\nLeeds University Union encourages\nmembers to apply for a rent reduction, and also provides free legal ad vice on the merits of each case. This scheme has bean working for over a year. I asked VicePresident Jack Straw some questions :\nQ.What has been the overall ect?\nA. A number of students have\nd their rents reduced. Many more ve bargained with their landlords, d got reductions by threatening to\nQ. Do landlords discriminate\n;a in st students as troublemakers?\nA. No more than usual, and our' d g in gs bureau hasn't noticed any lange.\nF. FUCHS FOLLOWING the short article on the\ni,on don Technical Colleges Conf e rence Mr. Frank Fuchs gave an interest-ng interview to FELIX. He explained; hat the LT CC was in noway a' backdoor\" to NUS and that the\nConference was not directly linked with NUS. It is a forum sponsored\noy NUS where technical colleges, both\nmembers and non-members of NUS could meet and discuss matters of Dommon interest.\nMr. Fuchs, who knows several\nmembers of NUS Council, said that\nhe would like to yu gg est to HC S Committee that they send observers\nalong to an LT CC meeting. However since he had not heard from the\nChairman Chris Miller, President of the Borough Polytechnic, for some\ntime, he was doubtful of the outcome.\nWhen asked why he intended to\nsuggest this to RCS rather than\n1C Union, he explained that\nthere had not been the opportunity to present it to Council and also that he felt he knew RCS Union. better than Council, of which he is a member.\nHe felt that there would be no serious objections to considering\njoining as it would, provide an important meeting point for NUS and non NUS technical colleges in Lon*don. The Conference would be keen\nfor us to join as this is such an important college.\nGUILDS\nUNION\nMEETING\nGuilds Union held the first of\ntheir usual rowdy meetings on the20 lh. October. The meeting began\nand I anGled hill, the secretary,\nprom t ly refused to read the minutes\nof the last meeting of last term in any other language than English. Morphy Day plans were outlined\nby Phil Marshall, VicePresident, of\nwhich the essential feature was his\n>o!e as di ici lor of operations from a co nvc i ent treetop. The President\nthen mentioned the I.C. Carnival arrangements and appealed for volunteers to enter a pedal car race\nnext Spring. The election for Guilds Rep onI.C.

Prc sidi iii followed; nei the i of the two candidates appeared to know much about the position they were\nseeking, i. ever lii ties slo ny Limn was duly ek'c ted. \u2022\n)\nAfter a mention of Guilds \u2014 Mines Carnival, to beheld on Nov.25 th., the floor was handed over to Jerry\nStockbridge who refused to take any responsibility for the Revue w li ich followed. How can you tell what it's like till you' ve worked there That's always the difficulty with choosing a career; you can't get much idea what it's really like from the outside\u2014which\nis why Unilever is giving you a chance to get an inside view.\nNext vacation, from Jan 2-4, we're holding an Introduction\nto Industry Course in London; it's designed to cover every\nessential aspect of industry; talks, discussions, a visit to a factory are all on the programme.

    "content": "FELIX7 TOP PEOPLE Tony Duke President of ICU Sir Owen\nSaunders Acting Rector The sudden death of the late\nRector Sir Patrick L instead leaves a gap at the head of Imperial College's administration. The gap has\nfilled by Sir Owen Saunders, Pro Rector at Imperial College since 1964,\nand now appointed Acting Rector.\nSir Owen Saunders, has a distinguished record both in the academic field\nand in an administrative capacity, in various academic bodies, inside and outside the College. Born in1904 he\nwas schooled at Emmanuel School and Birk beck College, London. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge as an undergraduate and there became a Senior Scholar. His long association with Imperial College began\nwhen be was appointed to a Lecture ship in Applied Mathematical Physics\nin1932. Academically his work has\nbeen centred on Applied Thermo dynamics and in particular heat\ntransfer. Made Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Head of the\nDepartment in1946. he became Dean of City and Guilds College in195 S. While the function of Sir Owen Saunders appointment is to bridge'\ngap before a permanent appointment\nis made, his task is not a light one,\nand the College is going through a stage of vast development and re-organisation. He sees this task as\nmaintaining the momentum of the\nchange and the policies introduced by the late' Rector. It would be dis-astro us, and ill-fitting too, to the\nmemory of Sir Parick L instead, to\nallow the pace of the College's pre sent development to lag. The Acting Rector compared himself to a caretaker Government, and while his\nhands are not bound, not a great deal\ncan be initiated in the interim period before a new Rector is appointed.\nHis job is to see that the present development is carried through with vigour. In particular, the Sports\nCentre, the new College Block both started in October 1 9 6 4 \u2014 and the new Halls of Residence will be\nadvanced to completion.\nSir Owen's view of Imperial College is that it has a' twin role' to\nfulfill. It is an institute to produce\nspecialists, specialists that a technologically based community requires,\nand for this it must be a centre of\nacademic excellence, holding a special, if not unique, position in British training and research. In addition, die College must' provide a 'University Education' \u2014 in the broad\nsense cf the term \u2014 to produce future\nleaders of industry and business who may move completely outside their\nown specific discipline. It contains a broad spectrum of discipline from the\nPure to the Applied \u2014 Ma thematic to\nEngineering \u2014 and to help to achieve\nthis latter role, greater contact\nbetween the departments, between\nthe groups within the departments\nand a more fluid motion of ideas\nbetween these groups must be aimed at. The broadening of Imperial College can be achieved, too, by in corD orating new schools within the\nCollege. In this sense, the Acting Rector will continue to work, as Sir Patrick ^ instead did, for an amalgam ation with the School oi the Architectural Association.\nm reply to the suggestion that\nmany undergraduates treat imperial(. ou e ge as an educational i actor y, rather than participating more fully in the lite or the College, Sir Owen thought that there were three ways\nto remedy this; much of which is\nalready provided. The Halls of Residence must be expanded, eventual-ly to absorb more students. Reside nci al life will then be the centre\nof t ne College outside academic af-fairs. Those living in digs will then naturally gravitate to the Residences\nfor a corporate cultural and social\nlife.\nSecondly, Imperial College pro vi des and should provide a wide range\nof social and cultural facilities;\nwhether the student uses them is\nanother matter. All that can be done here is to see they exist and to help\nthem flourish.\nThirdly a greater contact with other Colleges of London University\ncould be achieved. London University as a whole provides a vast range\nof activities.\nA general complaint of British\nUniversities is that the undergraduate\ncourses are too specialised, and re-st rik ted. directly to their own discipline. This, in particular, is a problem at Imperial College where\na high academic level must be\nachieved within a,3 year undergraduate course. Sir Owen would like\nto see the undergraduate courses\nbroadened so that students may defer\ntheir decision to specialise in a given direction till the end of their first\nyea. Some departments are anxious\nto see this change although others\nfear a lowering of standards.\nIn general, the Acting Rector described himself as a liberal. He would like to minimize comp usi on on students but attract them by stimulation.\nAbove all Imperial College is a college of a university, containing aw ide range of sciences which should\ninterlock with and stimulate each\nother. It contains post gra el nate s and\nundergraduates, mutually de pent:a large ratio of postgraduates is necessary to achieve a high academic\nstandard, but without the undergraduate the College would degenerate\ninto a Research Institution.\nTony Duke was elected President\nof ICU in June of this year. At the\ntime the reaction of many people\nwas ; \" Who?\" Even now his genial\nfeatures are none too well known,\nthough most evenings he can be found\nin Southside bar \u2014 \" I'm trying to get\nto know the people.\"\nDuring the speculation last year\nconcerning possible candidates it was\npointed out as a guide that tile Pre s ident usually came from the lower\nranks of Council. Tony came in from quite a different direction so let\nus trace his rise to the Presidency.\nHaving grown up in a rough area\nof Plymouth he arrived at IC with an impressive sporting record. At school he was Captain of Swimming and he played Rugby for the school\n( Plymouth College) and the country.\nA tIC he went straight into the 1st XV in which he still plays. His other social activities have included\nbei jig Leader of the Church Society\nand owning( and bending) sports cars,\nthe present one being an MG T F. It is now four years since Tony arrived at IC as a \u00bb Fresher in Ci vEng. For the past three years (Uvo\nundergraduate and one postgraduate)\nhe has been a Year Rep on Guilds' Council and would this year have\nbeen GuildsV Rep on IC Council. A knowledge of Council procedure he\nconsiders to be \" not essential \" ; what\ndoes matter is that he has a great\n' understanding of the general layout\u2014\u2022\nprobably best obtained from outside.\nTony comes to the Presidency with\nan open mind, probably as a result\nof not working previously on Council which can have a restricting influence. The accomplishments of the\nUnion and its present state he finds\nsatisfactory but he feels that there is\na lack of pride in the Union, an in sufficient loyalty to it. To him it\nseems that there are far too few active\nmembers ; all that is needed is for\neveryone to support one or two clubs\nor organisations really actively and there would be a great improvement\nin the Union's strength. Probably this\nsupport could come equally from undergrads and P.G S. \u2014 the latter\ncould help greatly by bringing in their\nexperience and responsibility while\nthe former have great scope available\nto them.\nThis is a difficult year for the Exec, the President sees danger to the\nUnion's freedom from\" empire\nbuilders \" and fears that a new Rector\nmight be less permissive than was the\nlate Sir Patrick L instead. It is a year for the Union to demonstrate\nits solidarity and responsibility,\n\" though I don't mind a little horse-play.\" Whatever happens Tony Duke feels that the Union will run happily.\n\n"
