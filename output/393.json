    "content": "FEU X STOIC RETROSPECT ON THE YEAR'S ACTIVITIES OF THE STUDENT\nTELEVISION OF THE IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE. Colin Grimshaw\nSTOIC HAS been operating a local TV service fa the students of Imperial\nCollege since March 1 9 7 0 .\nIn November 1974, the fortnightly news\nprogramme Topic which had been running\nfor three years was replaced by the new\nweekly news-magazine programme Lunch\nBreak. Also, on the 4th of that month,\nSTOIC was featured on BBC Radio London's programme 'Break Through'. The interview lasted ten minutes and featured\nMark. Caldwell, talking about the running\nof the society, and Colin Grimshaw, who commented on the technical side. The Interview was run by Andy Finney, an ex-IC student and one-time STOIC Chairman .\nDuring March STOIC made its first\nOutside Broadcast from the Great Hall; the event was the Hustings, covered In\nsound only . The next week this was followed up by full sound and vision coverage of the Election results. The response was excellent and we hope to do\nthe same again next year.\nAlongside the news programme, STOIC has provided light entertainment, discussion and interview programmes.\nIt Is the interviews of recent months that\nviewers may remember. These started in\nDecember 1974 when Lord George-Brown\nvisited the College to give a General\nStudies lecture. The interview which took\nplace after the lecture has made a very\ninteresting and welcome addition to\nSTOIC'S archives. Before we say more about other guests\nto STOIC, we must mention the unique\nsituation in which we now find ourselves. We mean of course the regular spot which we now have on the Channel7 network.\nThis Educational Cable Television system, which broadcasts over most of\nLondon, is run by the Inner London\nEducationa I Authority and can be received\nby 93 institutions, not counting ILEA schools. STOIC is the first student\ntelevision service to be given access to\nthe Channel. The interviews shown so far have been with Lord George-Brown,\nProfessor Lai thwaite, Professor Swanson\nand Mel Brooks. Readers of FELIX will know that the\nMet ( Blazing Saddles) Brooks interview\ntook place during the Easter vacation, when STOIC managed to scoop BBC Television and Radio. We must thank\nFOX RANK films for being so helpful\nwith the early arrangements for the\nprogramme.\nAt the end of April we interviewed the\nDirector, and scriptwriter of the FOX Rank film, 'Paper Tiger'! This programme\nincluded film clips, as did the one with Mel Brooks. Our most recent venture is with EMI films and Barry Humphries, of 'Aunt Edna'\nfame . His new film 'Barry McKenzle Hold\nHis Own' is due for release soon. This is\nthe first time that we have had a guest in\ndrag, in the studio; the Interview will be\nbroadcast over the ILEA Television Network during October.\nInterest in STOIC is not only growing\nwithin the College,' the BBC are also interested in the interviews that we are\narranging. LBC( London Broadcasting) are also taking the opportunity to come to certain recordings and interview our\nguests.\nWe feel this past year has been our\nmost successful and we look forward to\nthe 1975-1976 session when we hope to\nreceive further support from students at\nImperial College. BOG SPOT Descartes: 'To be is to do'\nSartre: 'To do is to be' .\nSinatra: 'Do-be do-be do' .\nFLATSHARE\nLooking for a place in a flat ?\nGot any spare places ?\nCONTACT IC FLAT SHARE If you are interested, come to the meeting tonight at 6 pm in the ICWA lounge.\n\n"

Although I have only had this post of\nSocial Sec. for a few weeks I have discovered that organising\nsocial events for the summer\nterm is not exactly easy. Amazing though it may\nsound, I am in the process of\n\"The Taming of the Shrew\".\nOriginally this was to be at the\nOpen Air Theatre (Regent's Park for those of you\u00abwho are\nso ignorant) but I have just had\na letter from the company\nsaying that due to the bad\nspring weather the building of\nthe new auditorium complex at\nthe Open Air Theatre has been\ndelayed. So, to avoid disappointing you all the production\nof \"The Taming of the Shrew\"\nis having a special season at\nthe Round House, Chalk Farm. Tickets for the evening\nperformance on June 30th are\nstill available, so anyone\nwanting tickets please come to\nthe IF Union any week-day\nbetween 1 pm \u2014 1.30 pm and hopefully someone should be\nthere.\nSocial events for the rest\nof the term (what there is left\nof it) seem to be almost non-existent, but next term's events\nare bound to be successful and\nwell supported. ( Let's hope so anyway).\nLETTERS\nThe Referendum\nImperial College,\n1st June, 1975.\n\">ear Sir,\nUnfortunately when this\notter appears the referendum\nv ill have come and gone but\nnevertheless 1 feel I must\nom ment on Mr Phillips' fer v our in urging us to vote which\nip pea red in FELIX392. His assurance that \"It is a historical decision\", paralleled by Capital Radio's \"This is\nthe most important decision of\nyour life\" and HM Government's It is possibly the most\nimportant choice that the\nBritish people have ever been\nasked to make\" is misplaced\nenthusiasm . In fact the choice\nwe have is between industrial,\ncorporate capitalism; and\nanything further is purely\nillusory. However it is salutary to\nsee Trotskyists. supporting\nnational sovereignty and rather\nun using to see fellow cabinet\nministers at one another's ihr oats but that is where my\ninterest ends .\nEconometrics is a young and\nhighly imprecise science. It is\ncertainly not possible to say whether leaving the EEC will aid our economic development\nor not, nor whether the EEC has cushioned or exacerbated\nour national crisis in the past\ntwo years. In any case our\nmajor raw materials, especially oil, are not under European\ncontrol so we still pay d is proportionate prices on the\nworld market.\n1 would contend that the\nreferendum is largely irrelevant.\nIndeed Mr Phillips analogy\nwith the European cup final\nwas peculiarly opposite \u2014 one\nside may have the superior\narguments, the other side may\nwin but the ball has no real\nsay in the matter; it just gets\nkicked around.\nPower of the people!\nAndrew T.

Firstly to set Mr Phillips' hunted mind at rest. He has\nhitherto been nothing more than\na name on paper, to me. Therefore I cannot see how he can\naccuse me of directing an attack at him personally. However, the IF Union would\nbe delighted to make his acquaintance and lend him a sincerely friendly ear any time\nhe cares to vis it us. Secondly the letter from IF ex-President Katie Makinnon:\nat the risk of sounding petty\nmyself, I can only say her\ncriticism strikes a rather\nshallow note. If she is so concerned about the organisation\nof next year's Rag activities, I suggest she consults the Rag Co-or d in at or who will no doubt\nset her inquiring mind at rest.\nYours faithfully,\nLorna Thomas\nRag Rep, IF\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX \u2022\nTHE EPILOGUE( Continued from page 8)\nFinally, a few miscellaneous comments.\nIt has been for me a great priv i ledge to be\nthe Editor of FELIX. I nevertheless look\nforward to passing on this burden. During\nthe first term I got through 100 tablets of\n' He dex'. It was no joke when I fell a sleep one night trying to solve a lay-out\nproblem: I woke up the following morning\nstill thinking about it. The worst part of\nthe Editor's job occurs when he has to\nfind enough enthusiasm to write up a very\ntrivial story. This year has been intensely interesting and extremely challenging,\nbut I cannot, in the true sense of the word,\nsay that I have enjoyed this year. Indeed,\na sabbatical year is not there to been-joyed; it is a year of hard work and\nrightly so.\nI am not a male chauvinist pig: I just\ncannot stand those insipid females who\nbelieve that they are God's gift to IC;\nthey do no good to the cause of women's equality whatsoever. One big regret that\nI have had over the past year has been my\ndismal and unforgivable failure to recognise the potential of sports articles as\npossible front-page leads. I believe that\nFELIX is in a good position to encourage\nspectator attendances at important\nmatches. Unfortunately, I have only just\ncome to that conclusion; there is still next year though.\nAfter nearly 4000 words, I think I had\nbetter stop. Take care and remember:\nKeep The Cat Free!\nMichael Williams\nFALL\nRichard Waring - Paul Ekpenyong\nA RESIDENT of Garden Hall is gravely\nill in hospital today following a60ft fall form his window on Tuesday night.\nBrian Metcalf was standing on his\nbalcony as a friend went to the door.\nWhen the friend returned he had fallen.\nWhen he was reached he was con cio us with his head resting on some plastic\nguttering which he had brought down with\nhim.\nAn ambulance was immediately called. Five minutes later three fire engines\nturned up. The ambulance appeared about\nten minutes after this. It took a further\nhalf an hour to remove him so as not to\nexacerbate his injuries in any way. The police were also at the scene\nand it was they who measured the height\nof his fall, as well as bringing down some\nplastic guttering he is believed to have\nstruck some wire netting.\nOn arrival at St. Mary's Hospital Paddington Brian was placed in the\nintensive care unit where his condition\nwas said to be critical. His injuries\ninclude a dislocated pelvis, a broken\nthigh, several broken ribs, a collapsed\nlung, and internal bleeding. The latest\nbulletin indicates the location of the\ninternal bleeding has not been found and\nis still seriously ill. Brian is a first year Physicist and had\nalready completed his exams. He had\nbeen under total anaesthetic at the dentist on Monday and had drunk\nfour pints on Tuesday evening. It is\nthought that this resulted in a dizzy spell or temporary blackout which caused him\nto fall.\nPREC3 P3CE\nTrevor Phillips\nTHE FELIX Editorial of 30th May,\nwhilst questioning my \"quasi-martyrdom\"\nin not awarding myself a Union General\nAward on somewhat spurious grounds,\ndoes however raise the question of\nwhether our ways of recognising particular\nservice to, contributions to the activities of the Union are adequate. Had the Editor of FELIX deigned to attend the AGM at\nwhich I awarded him aUG A he might have\nhad more constructive comments to make.\n(Some of us have to work almost single\nhandedly on a Thursday in order to\nproduce a Friday FELIX - Ed.)\n1 would contend that the award system,\nfor ICU certainly, and possibly the\nCC U's, is inadequate. There is no\naccepted policy on the award of ICU\nSocial Colours or U GAs, except the\nCouncil minute that lays down the\ncomposition of the Colours Committee,\nand says that Council may award social colours after the Social Colours Committee\nhas made its list of recommendations.\nThe manner in which selection is made\nis governed by convention only; and those\nconventions have changed with virtually\nevery year.\nFor instance in the case of Social Colours, this year we conducted a secret\nballot amongst the members of the\nCommittee, after having had an explanation\nof the merits of each person nominated.\nThis ensured that the list was much more\nselective than hitherto, and, I would\nargue, more meaningful. There was a larger number of nominations than last\nyear.\nIn the case of U GA's, the conventions\nhave changed much more rapidly, from a point where the President awarded them,\nafter consultation with the Hon Sec and\nDP, to the present situation where the\nPresident has absolute discretion and\ngives awards to whom he likes, and for\nwhat reasons he alone sees fit. U GA's are effectively a President's Award. There is no question of his \" accepting\" or \" rejecting\" one, as implied by FELIX. It has tie en argued that he should receive\none ex-officio, to save him the embarrassment of awarding himself one. This Is\nabsurd. How can anyone receive an award,\npresumably for outstanding service in his\noffice, simply by virtue of having held\nthat office? By definition most Presidents,\nsay* wi II be mediocre, not outstanding.\nWorse yet, can one award oneself \" the supreme accolade\"? Of course not; this\nwould be behaviour reminiscent of the\nmost pompous and self-important tin pot banana-state rulers. It is behaviour that\nI would not wish to emulate.\nHowever, the worst aspect of it all is\nthat U GAs are awarded on the decision one person only, and the one person with\nprobably the most biased opinions on the\nUnion's priorities. In my case I gave\nU GA's to people who really could not be\ndenied them by any reckoning. They were\nalso personal tributes to people for whose\nwork I have a great deal of admiration, in\ndifferent ways. However is it acceptable that the\nUnion's premier award should be made in\nsuch a way?. I think not. Even the Colle tp only award Fellowships through the\nGoverning Body \u2014 on recommendation of\nthe Fellowships Committee.\nThe question must be asked as to why\nI did not end the system myself. The\nanswer is simply that the reorganisation\nof awards has not been my major priority\nthis year; whether we give U GAs or not is\nunlikely to change the price of cheese.\nHowever, I do think that changes should\nbe made. Personally, I would prefer to see\nCouncil or UGMs awarding Honorary Life\nMembership, and I am taking steps to\nintroduce this.\nFinally, it must not be assumed that\nI oppose awards in principle. I do not. I do believe that people deserving of them\nshould have the satisfaction of knowing\nthat the widest possible cross-section of\nUnion members recognised the value of\ntheir contribution. For me, at least, that\nis the pleasure to be gained out of any\nkind of award. I believe that the people\ngaining U GA's and Social Colours this\nyear can rest assured that they do have\nthat recognition, and steps will be taken\nto formalise that situation.* WITH REGARD to awards, can anyone\nthink of a socially acceptable substitute\nfor a tie, for women to wear/use?\n*\nI APOLOGISE if hackles were raised\nat IF by my letter to FELIX last week.\nCriticism was not directed at the Institute\ngenerally nor particularly at the author of\n\"IF Only\" but at a particularly fallacious\nview held by many people, about student\nactivists. It Is a view that must be nai led.\nIt may not have been directed at me\npersonally. However, unless students can\nview their leaders/servants with confidence, not cynicism, the potential of\nthe potential of student unions, and\nindeed, the movement itself is immensely\nreduced.\n\u00a9 1975\nNewspaper of IC Union\nEditor: Michael.

He\ncame to IC in 1971 to study Chemistry and having passed his first year, was promoted to Dep. Rep. Success at this brought him\nto the elevated heights of floor rep. to ICU Council. He participated\nfully in Council affairs and made his presence felt, raising the\nstatus of the floor rep from its previously inoperative depths.\nHowever, parallel to his more serious pursuits, he was the Editor of the Rag Mag \u2014 notable for its infamous \" dead baby jokes\". Progressing \" naturally\" from being the Chairman of the\nWorking Party considering the future of FELIX, he subsequently\nbecame its Editor. A job to which he devoted all his energies\nand has followed with a single-mindedness which has lead to the\nrediscovery of skills lost during the letterpress era. The dedication\nwith which he has tackled the min umer able problems which faced\nhim at the outset resulted in his being awarded a thoroughly\ndeserved U GA.H 'is year in office has, however, not been without controversy,\nfor while his reviews have caused no comment, the introduction\nof the page three photograph has drawn the comment; \"He is a male chauvin st s\"t.\"At times, he has voiced doubts about the\njob and on a STOIC interview said, \"You have to be a dildo to\ndo this job\". He can only but be praised for his attempts to integrate FELIX into the IC social life; the FELIX ANNUAL MOTOR RALLY and the FELIX PHOTOGRAPHIC COMPETITION being prime examples of this. On getting to know him well one soon realises his true\ncharacter. Behind his durable authoritative exterior lurks a nostalgic sentimentalist. Whilst producing the 25th Anniversary\nIssue his desire to bring back the past and put FELIX above\neverything else manifested itself greatly. To be fair one must\nquote him, \"Not all of us are in it for the ego-trip\",\nMike tends to be a bit of a lone wolf but after knowing him for\na while his initially reserved attitude changes to one of a good\nfriend. He is a keen sportsman, rifle and pistol shooting being\nhis forte for which he has won various medals.\nMike will now be directing his abundant talents to research\ninto the properties of polymers. He will no doubt be prominent\nin the Union and will express his views on the various topics of\nthe day. It only remains for the Editor-elect to gather up the\npieces of the FELIX staff and fill in the necessary gaps to\nproceed on another year's publication of this outstanding\nnewspaper.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nA YEAR WITH ^\nRS M^ John Mortimer\nTO SUM UP, in so few words, the many\nachievements of so many people would be\nimpossible and any attempt infinitely\nboring to the majority of FELIX readers.\nA year of involvement with IC Union has\nconvinced me that student power at IC van be defined as one of two things; either\nthe output and annoyance value of a stereo\nsystem or the ability of elbow and forearm\nto perform cyclic operations for periods\nnormally ranging between 1 and 24 hours. So disappointed was I at one stage,\nwith the level of student participation\nthat I, self styled opponent of Phillips ian left wing subversion, found myself\nproposing such un sporting ploys as\n\"executive walkouts\" and \"withdrawal\nof facilities\". However, my day trip to the\nLeft End soon ended on realising that the\nUnion allocation of funds was on a per\ncapita basis. It occured to me, in a balance restoring flash, that the fewer\npeople making use of the Union's resources\nand services the more that remained for\nthose who enjoyed participating. As I was\namongst this number, it therefore seemed\nintelligent to ignore the whole issue. My\nnormal imbalance having been therefore\nrestored, I tried to come to terms with\nstudent apathy with respect to IC Union\nand never quite succeeded. Of course it is not so difficult in Mines, where an average of about 50% undergraduate participation can be achieved,\nand it is in this spirit that our strength\nin Mines lies. Despite a few set backs during the\nyear, notably the removal of our Davy by\nGuilds, a charitable opposition would\nnot deny the quality performance of our\nsmall section of the college. The success\nis attributable to the Mines Spirit (mostly\nalcohol), its' members and the organisers\nof the years social and rag collecting activities. Even taking account of\ninflation, our contribution of \u00a32350 to\nrag gives some indication of the very\nhard work put in by Pat Gorman and the\nSocial Reps .\nThe relationship of Great Britain to\nthe Common Market is paralleled by the\nConstituent College/Imperial College\nrelationships. In the search for unity and\nefficiency the constituent organisation\ncombine, exchanging services and sharing\nfacilities. As a natural consequence\nsome right to self determination is\nsacrificed and this has been accepted.\nI suspect, however, that to many, the\nvalue of their group identity within the\nsystem is of utmost importance. Is it\nimpossible to be pro Britain and pro\nEurope? Is it possible to be pro C CU and\npro Imperial College? Put like this, the\nanswer is simple. Clearly, there need be\nno conflict. In my opinion conflict arises\nwhen the te sue of identity is forgotten.\nIn Mines we are proud of our College, as indeed are members of lesser institutions proud of their own, and rightly so. The reason conflict arises lies in the\nfailure of Imperial College Union to\nrecognise and ut li lise the identity of the\nCC U's to the community advantage.\nRather, they choose to ignore it, creating\na fourth unit rather than a combination of\nthree.\nThe strength of Imperial College is the :\npride that we have in our institutions. The reason Imperial College's reputation\nis high is because of the reputation it has\nin the field of mineral and metal production,\nof engineering and of science. Imperial\nCollege is nothing if not a combination\nof these.\nThe C CU system has been attacked\nbefore and will, no doubt, be attacked\nagain. I believe it is the right and proper\nway to make use of the spirit which exists in the constituent Colleges. To do so,\nImperial College Union should be\nstructured as a pyramid. Put simply for\nmath amati cia ns and scientists:3 xC CUS ICUN B: Depending on complexion of power,\nICU may be placed on the left of the\nequality. However, this may pro dure an\ninequality,\nICU< \u2022 3 xC CU. It was for this reason that I opposed\nthe ICU Executive position for the Post Graduate Affairs Officer. Over the years,\nICU posts have become entirely independent of CC U's and this makes ICU a weak and ineffective machine. Our strength\nis through the CC U's.I hope that next\nyear the situation may improve and that\nthe recent social successes may continue.\nIn this I wish you all the very best of\nluck. PS.

    "content": "12 ft ll X RUGBY TOUR\nCAST YOUR mind back to the final day of last term when\ntwenty ex-rugby players joined the new elite College society,\nMafiasoc. This happy family set off to Brussels for five days of\ndrinking, honking, drinking and chun de ring, with the odd game of\nrugby which had unfortunately been arranged before hand. Arrival at Ostende was\nuneventful except for three\npeople being sick opposite the\nduty free bar and one person\nwho shall remain nameless\nclimbing over the passport\ncontrol barrier since he did not want a nasty blue stamp\non his brand new passport. At\nlast our feet had hit Belgian soil and there was an uncontrollable urge to embrace\nand welcome the local peasantry. Whereupon our\nheroic nameless person rushed\nonto the Brussels train and hit\nthe first person he could see\nfor sitting in our seats. In no\ntime at all we piled out of the\ntrain at Brussels Midi only to\nfind we should get off at\nBrussels Nord. In the ensuing\npanic to re board the train, D. Hart thought of a novel way of\nhelping by collapsing in the\ndoorway.\nArriving at the correct\nstation at last, half the party\nmanaged to obtain taxis to\ntake them to what appeared an\nold converted fortress, Hotel\nLito. The other half of the\nparty decided to walk as the\nhotel was only around the corner\nAt last blissful sleep\ndec ended and there was time to\nlay back and take a count of\nthe day's proceedings. It was\ndecided that Big Lipscombe\nwas in the lead with 5 chun d ers and one unconfirmed.\nThe next day saw our\nher ioc band heavily defeated\non the fie Id of combat by British Brussels RFC. The least said\nabout this game the better but\nmention should be made of M. Cotter, known to his friend as\nthe Hog, and A. Williams for\nhis fine try. Sorrows were\nquickly drowned with bottles\nof Stella and the Belgian populace subjected themselves\nto stout renderings of Nellie Hawkins. The evening after match\ncelebrations were virtually\nexcessive with many people\nonly just managing to stagger\nthe fifty yards from cafe\nRoyal to the hotel. At1.00 pm\nthe hotel doors were locked\nand barred but S.Chu dy, suffering from a fit of claustrophobia, left via the window\nand the aid of a drainpipe.\nUnfortunately when twelve feet\nfrom the ground on his return\nentrance a special angled\nsection of the drainpipe allowed\nChudy to return quickly to\nground level by coming away\nin his hands. The resulting\ndive into the concrete pavement\nwas given nine out of ten marks\nfor stupidity.\nThe next day, Sunday, was\ndeemed a day of rest and by\nmid-day ap petit ies were running\nhigh due to the fact that there\nwas virtually no restaurant\nopen by the hotel. An unsuspecting tour member who\nventured into the room of\nLipscombe was immediately\ntold to get out and only return\nif he was between two slices of bread. Soon strength was\nback to normal and meetings\nwere held in various cafes in\nthe Brussels centre to elect a leader and boss of Mafiasoc,\nMr Big. The first candidate was\nU.G.Ly booth whose every\ncommand was to be obeyed\nexplicitly. He was soon\nsacked as Mr Big for walking\nmore than one hundred yards\nto the next cafe. Lipscombe\n(hen stepped forward to accept\nthe title of Big and with the\naid of a chronic attempt at an Italian accent de put is edM. Sergot as his Luigi. To cries\nof \"Wheresa ma sph a gh etti\" the cafe crawl commenced with\nthe rule that when Big drinks\neverybody drinks. Cement boots\nwere prepared for people failing\nto obey Luigi or Big and S. Booth, known to his victims as\nSss ssT. was given the job of\ncontract man.\nMonday followed Sunday, as\nexpected, and after the evenings\nstandard refreshment several\npeople paid a visit to the hotel\nthey stayed in last year. They\nwere so heartily welcomed that\nthe owner gave them a few\npillows and some other various\nitems suitable for placing under\na coat. Meanwhile Big and\nLuigi together with Jeffs,\nSutton and Wrigley who formed\nLe Grand C ing had returned\nafter the hotel was locked and\ndecided to stay in more\nspacious accommodation in the\nform of a partly built office\nblock. Bedding was sparse and\nLipscombe exercised his\nauthority as Big and slept in a cardboard box they had found.\nCRICKET ANNUAL REVIEW THIS YEAR the Captaincy of the Cricket Club has been split\nto some degree in that the Sunday XI has been captained by\nGraham Webb ahd Tom G ho sh; the official Captain being Andrew\nHall For the 1st XI the season so far, has been moderately successful with a record of 3 wins,1 draw, 3 lost and 5 matches\ncancelled due. to rain. The\nexams have, as usual, taken\ntheir toll of players and the\nimpossibility of selecting a regular first team has been\nrather frustrating.\nThe season began with two\nexcellent wins. In the first,\nHeston were dismissed for\nonly 40 (G. Webb 6-6) and IC\nmade the runs for the loss of\ntwo wickets. After a poor batting performance against South\nStanmore when IC were all out\nfor 88 (A. Ghosh 31), the\nmatch was won by IC in an\nexciting finish in which\nS. Stanmore were dismissed for\n84 (A. Hall412) only 4 runs\nshort!\nAt St. Johns, Cambridge on\nMay 3rd the 1 sf s were well beaten; St. Johns rather\nlaboriously compiled 175-5\nthen having given IC just over\n2 hours to make the runs bowled\nus out for 8 8 .\nNext weekend (after a cancelled mid-week fixture)\nagainst Magdalen Oxford it\nAt last the final day of the\ntour arrived and everybody set\noff to Brussels University to\nsee IC thrash their opposition\nby over fifty points to nil. The\ngame was played at midday\nthereby allowing the whole of\nthe afternoon for supping. A mammoth singsong against our\nfriendly Belgian entertainers\nprovided a fitting climax, well almost for G. Clement, for the\ntour.\nEverybody enjoyed themselves and I wish next years\norganiser every success and\npity.\nTour Party\nD. Shakesbeff (Leader) K. Libscombe (Mr Big) M.

Fearn (Special\nDelivery)\nwas IC's turn to laboriously\ncompile 169-8 ( D. Millard 48,\nM. Taytor 44, J. England 29)\nemulate St. Johns\nbut failed to emulate St. Johns\nand lost by five wickets. The first league match\nagainst Whitton was cancelled\nbecause of rain, each side\ntaking 5'points.\nThe next Wednesday the\nfirst tra ve I led down to Haywards\nHeath to play Mid. Sussex C.C. where another poor batting\nperformance left the opposition\nto make 88: which they did for\nthe loss of eight wickets\n(A. Ha 1\n1 5-30) after a concerted\nattempt at redemption of our\nbatting failure.\nOur second league match\nwas ca nee I led by the op posit i on\nMotspur Park because they\nwould not raise a team, so IC\ntook the maximum 15 points.\nA seriously depleted 1st XI\nmet Hurlingham Oddfellows at\nHarlington on May 28th where\nthey made 184-3 after 5 catches\nhad been dropped by our\nrecognised cricketers! A generous declaration by the\nopposition was not fully\nexplored when nearly all our\nbatsmen appeared to be\nmes meri sed into donating\ntheir wickets.by a ridiculously\n' easy' slow bowler. However\nIC held on to draw the match\nfinishing with 126-8 (A. Hall47 n.o.). On Saturday 31st May,\nprobably the best IC 1st XI this\nseason batted miserably on a fast wicket at Churchill, Cambridge and were all out for\n88 (yet again). However an\nexcellent bowling performance\nby the medium paced bowler\nkept Churchill within our\nmeagre total and were all out\nfor 69 ( J. Bashar 5-20).\nThe season so far has been\ncharacterised by poor batting,\ngiving wickets away and\ndropped catches. The wickets\nhave been lost by impatience\nto score runs, especially to\nostensibly gentle bowling and\nthe catches have been dropped\ndue to lack of concentration.\nHowever there is still much of\nthe season, to come and of\ncourse the tour!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX A YEAR WITH\nRCS\nMartin Kessler & Nick Payne\nTHE PAST session has seen the Royal College of Science Union continuing with\nall of its traditional activities and venturing into several totally new fields.\nOverall, it has been a reasonably successful year and it is hoped that a firm foundation has been laid for next\nyears officers to build upon.\nOur Sports Clubs have all had very\ngood seasons, especially the Rugby and\nHockey clubs. RCS Rugby l st XV did not\nlose a match before Christmas and only\nfailed to regain the Sparkes Cup because\nin the event of a tie, the holders retain it. RCS Hockey lost only one game out of\nfourteen in their successful campaign to\nwin the Stephenson Cup and to gain\npromotion to the l st division of the UL league. The Tech Cup is the main reason\nfor the existence of RCS Soccer Club and\nthis was won by hammering Mines 5-2 and\nGuilds 6-0. Rifle and Boat Clubs both did\nbetter than expected and have the basis\nfor good teams in the future .The academic\nsocieties have continued to attract\ninterest in both their lectures and brewery\ntrips. Chem soc and Biochemsoc have\nbeen particularly active. The Rag effort reached its peak with\nthe Departmental Collections, in which a barrel of beer was offered to the year that\ncollected most per head. This bait resulted\nin the phenomenal sum of \u00a31100 being\ncollected in ONE day. The last stunt was\nthe most ambitious, a round-London\nTreasure Hunt based on the sites of the\n'Monopoly' board. Other profitable\ncollections included a mock football\nmatch outside Harrods and the alcoholic\nPHOENIX Reviewed\nIan Morse\nTHE RE EMERGENCE of PHOENIX after an absence of some three years,\nleft me wondering (after reading it from\nfront to front) if the contents depicted\nthe genesis of budding young contemporary artists or the worthless meandering s of adolescent pl s s artists. How would I know? I 'll drink Watneys,\nTartan or any other liquid refreshment\nprovided Ido not have to pay more than\n1p. Anyway, I found the artwork in general\nwas down on previous issues, exceptions\nbeing 'The Lost Cause' and Nick Eu stance's piece. The poems of Messrs\nAppleby and C limo show that they\nprobably get their inspiration from\noutside IC.' The Audience' was obviously\nthe work of a genius.\nWere the short stories (together with\n'Art of Computing') the most worthwhile\ninclusions? On balance, they probably\nwere. Overall, I suppose it would be fair to\nsay the Editor did a remarkable job getting\nanything published at all, considering\n4,000 eligible 'artists' seem to be\nsuffering from the 'apathy rules' syndrome.\nLet us hope more than a handful of\nstudents contribute material for the next\nissue, and so hopefully, raise the\nstandard.\nStill, it seems so far to be a most\npopular publication, by the way people\nwere buying it in the Union bar. Bill Gerrard going around like a Sdvation Army\nOfficer on a Saturday night selling copies\nof ' War cry!'... or was it 'Young Soldier'?\ncarol singing and these helped us to our\nfinal total of \u00a33700, the best for many\nyears.\nThe dinners, organised by R CSU, have\nbeen characterised, for the first time in many years, by eff i cent, smooth and reliable organisation. The Fresher s' Dinner ' gave the newcomers in each\ndepartment an insight into the Union and\nan opportunity to meet some members of\nstaff. This run of dinners culminated in the one for the new Division of Life\nSciences, attended by the Rector, Dean,\nno less than four Heads of Departments\nand about 200 lesser mortals. During the\nyear two other formal dinners were he Id.\nThe first was a quality dinner to celebrate\nthe christening of the new Theta, which\noccured, amid the popping of Champagne\nbottle corks, at 1930 hours on Thursday\n13th February. The Annual Dinner was\nheld early in the summer term, attended\nby some hundred people.\nThe Union's Entertainments Committee,\nafter running a very popular Smoking\nConcert, entered sketches in the other\nC CU Revues and then experimented with\n\"Voluptuous Variety\",an old Time Music hall. A lot of hard work was put into this\nand despite the small audience it was very\nwell received and there are plans for\nanother Music Hall next year. The Annual Ball was again held at Silwood Park and,\ndespite minor friction with some residents,\nwas enjoyed by all attending. A disco was provided as well as the usual dance\nband, cabaret, coffee lounge and bar. An extension of Ents was to provide a regular\n'Night Out' in the second term. This grew\nout of an idea used in Rag Week and these\nevents included ice skating and trips to\nCinema and Theatre.\nJezebel went, as an observer, on the\nV CC Brighton Run in November and one of\nthe big-end bearings disintegrated. She\nwas towed back to College, arriving in\nthe very early hours and was off the road\nfor six months. After only 200 miles the\nnew bearing is showing signs of wear and\nso J ez is, once again, in pieces to\ndetermine the cause and apply some\nprevent it ive medicine. After the loss of\nTheta to Guilds and its subsequent\nrecovery following a protracted 'treasure'\nhunt, construction of a new Theta was\nbegun. It now consists of a stainless steel bulb with six feet of hydraulic\npiping attached. The whole weighs over\n1 OOlbs and the bulb is engraved with an\nRCS Crown, a capital' Theta' and the\nyear ' 1 9 7 5 ' . The stem has a logarithmic\nscale from zero to infinity.\nOn the publicity and retail side,\nBroadsheet has continued to be published\nand the range of RCS goods available has\nbeen extended. Broadsheet appeared\nfortnightly for the first two terms and in the last issue contained several pages of\nlitho ed photographs, the quality of which\neasily rivalled FELIX.( Who is Mike\nWilliams anyway?). RCS S lopp and T shirts\nhave been selling well and new lines\ninclude single ts, long-sleeved T shirts, RCS Holdall s and Theta shirts. The year has marked a distinct\nimprovement in RC SU/R CSA( Old Students\nAssociation)co-operation and co-ventures.\nThe two organisations have shared a handbook for several years and, to enable\npresent students to meet past ones, RCS A ran a series of sherry parties for second\nyear students .\nThe past year has seen the start of the\nend of an era for the Union. R CSU goes\ninto session1975/76 having \u2014 hopefully\n\u2014 moved into a suite of offices in the\nnewly completed W2 and also equipped\nwith a new mascot, un violated to date,\nthanks to the ef for st of Dad's Army. The\nUnion must cater for all tastes and thus\nits officers must make all possible efforts\nto find out the views of the Union members\nand the Union members must tell their\nofficers what they want done. This is\nnecessary in order that the Royal College\nof Science Union may continue to play its\nrole in college life .\nA YEAR WITH, ^\nC&G \u00a3l Jenny Jones\n1974-75 HAS seen many changes in Guilds Union some temporary, like a female President, others like the improvement of the Exec etc not hopefully just\na one year thing.\nWe started off the year with a very\nsuccessful if exhausting Freshers week\nwhen we seemed to entertain the fresher s to beer, and yet more beer. The first bar\nnight was very good with Chem Eng3 staking their claim to the crown of\nchampion boat racers!\nFreshers Dinners went off very well too, apart from Dave's and my grey hairs\nat the Chem Eng Dinner when we fully\nexpected a fierce battle with RCS having\npreviously 'borrowed' their mascot from\nthe Maths Freshers Dinner. Which very\nneatly brings me on to that topic very dear\nto the hearts of all of us this year:-mascot ry. This year we have suceeded in\ntaking three mascots, Theta from RCS Davy from RS M and Phineas from UC. Apart from the terrific prestige and glory\nit has given to Guilds I hope that we have\nstarted up the mascot ry war again, which\nI think is a very important part of be ling ing to aCC U. Already RCS and RS M have\nmade them new much more nick able mascots. Field cup happened(?) again and\nmuch to our surprise, as shame on us we\nwere not too sure who Management\nScience were, the trendy executives in the\npin striped suits won by drinking vast\nquantities of beer wine whiskey g in.... honest gu vI didn't let them bribe me!\nBo went down to Brighton yet again,\n(even though we did not have an official\nentry) and has also just come back from\nthe Manchester to Blackpool Run with\njust a couple of pieces of silverware!\nThe pedal car club went off to Bristol again, and although they had scrapped the\nevent that we normally win without telling us we managed to win one prize. Motor\nClub too has been organising rallies, treasure hunts and auto-tests. Its very\nnice to see the 'Old Lags' turning out for\nthese events.\nCarnival did not happen as usual in the\nfirst term, but eventually we held it in the\nfirst week of the spring term. At long last\nthe saga of the damage is now over and\nwe have paid \u00a3100 towards alleged\ndamage. I think that Carnival will not be\nin College Block for a while. The Dinner\nand Dance, although an outstanding\nsuccess, was not very well attended and\nI can see there being problems in the\nfuture organising the more formal type of\nevent within the students pocket.\nRevue was the other traditional event\nthat happened and this too was successful with apparently a pretty rope y stripper.\nWe tried some Guilds outings too this\nyear: we went on a pub crawl and to the\ncinema and hopefully they will be extended\nand improved ne.xt year.\nSportingwise too we seem to have\nbeen fairly successful: we won the\ns parkes Cup( just) and the Courtman\nShield (overwhelmingly).\nOur Union meetings have not been\nvery well attended, partly due to the\nrather rowdy affairs that they have become\nbut we have had a couple of very amusing\nones the best being I think the handover\nmeeting at the Albert Memorial where\napparently we broke every rule in the\nbook.\nAs I said I think that we have had a good year this year despite many setbacks\nand I hope that next year City and Guilds Union will go from strength to strength.\n\n"

Indeed\nhidden amongst much of the\nrhetoric can be found fundamental debating points\nwhich reflect a genuine concern\nwith regard to a particular\ntopic .\nThe issue to be raised is this: Recognising firstly the\nbad feeling which \"bitching\"\nwill inevitably create and\nsecondly the fact that in the\nmajority of instances, in the\npast year the controversy was\nsettled amicably, then is it\nalways necessary to raise the\ndispute in public?\nThere is evidence to support\nthe view that it is the \" public\" aspect of the dispute coupled\nwith the hostile terms in which an otherwise \" fair\" comment is sometimes couched\nwhich is capable of doing the\nmost damage.\nDuring the pas t year the\nFEU X Letters Column has been the scene of criticisms both constructive and destructive, mild and vehement.\nWhilst undoubtedly the Column\nhas been lively and enter-tai ning, the question has tobe\nasked \"At what cost?\"\nBy all means let us have\ncontroversies, but next year at\nleast, may the almost Satanic\nrite of \" bitching\" cease. Here ende th the lesson\nfrom the gospel according to\nSt. FELIX.\nSTOIC DOES IT AGAIN! STOIC, IC's own student television service, has managed to scoop\nthe national media yet again by an exclusive interview with BARRY HUMPHRIES, the creator and co-star of the latest Barry Mckenzie\nfilm \"Barry McKenzie Holds His Own\". Mr Humphries arrived at the\nSTOIC studio yesterday in drag and created pandemonium. The\ninterview is to be broadcast next Tuesday in the J CR, Southside and\nUnion. Watch out for posters .\nWHAT A SCORCHER!\nAT LAST, it has happened. After much wheeling and dealing\nit was finally announced last Monday that the final plans,\nincorporating the original suggestions which had been agreed\nupon, are to be fully implemented \" in the very near future\".\nThis announcement, made\nby the Editor of FEU X, Mike\nWilliams, comes as a great\nshock to many senior Union\nofficials who were last night\nexpressing \"grave concern\"\nabout the possible effects\nthis unexpected move might\nhave on the future of FELT X and indeed the Union itself. Speaking on behalf of the\nUnion, Trevor Phillips the\nICU President said,\" I have no\ndoubt that it is Mike Williams'\nintention to create within the\nbroadly-based framework which\nhas been built up around\nFELIX this year a more\nfundamental style of approach\nto solving the more\ntroublesome aspects of the\nnewspaper which have been\ndifficult to overcome in light\nof inflation and the Government\ncuts in educational\nexp endure.\" The FELIX Staff were less\nguarded in their views.\" I don't like it,\" said Richard\nTurn to page 2\nSPECIAL\nCOLOUR\nEDITION\n\n"

    "content": "8 FELIX\nTHE EPILOGUE( Continued from page 7)\nsuddenly all of Council was buzzing\nabout it . When the time came for the\ndecision to be taken, the majority of the\nExecutive were quite rightly undecided:\nThey had not sufficient informal ion upon\nwhich to base a decision .The. recommendation to re-allocate the FELIX sabbatical\nto the as yet uncreated post of Finance/ Buildings Officer was rejected in favour\nof a move to create a non-sabbatical\nJunior Treasurer and a working party to\ninvestigate, gather the facts and make\nrecommendations on the workings of the\nFELIX office and the central administration. U is gratifying to state\nnow that the working party report which\nis to be presented to Joint Council next\nMonday has independently confirmed\npractically everything that I said and\nargued at the time when the topic was\nfirst broached.\nThe situation with regard the FELIX sabbatical was potentially dangerous: a re-allocation would have far-reaching\n\u00a3 disastrous consequences in my view.\nThe complex arguments involved made\nthe whole thing very vulnerable to\nmisconception. A working party was\nessential for a meaningful outcome.\n\"Complexity breeds vulnerability\" is an\naxiom which I coined last summer. Whilst\nsome will always disbelieving ly sneer at\nit, I nevertheless fee! that it is applicable\nto a wide variety of situations . How many\nof us were vulnerable to the misconceptions\ncreated on either side due to the\ncomplexity of the arguments used during\nthe recent Referendum campaigns?\nThe second term saw the brunt of the\nNF v. The Left saga, much of which was\napproximately tiresome . Personally I was\nunable to endorse the attitude of either\nside, my main concern at the time being\nin terms of what the overseas students\nat IC felt about the situation. Many of\nthem seemed quite unperturbed. I found\nthe NF's racist attitude unpleasant and\nthe Left's tactics silly. I should have\nthought that the Left would have realised\nby now that to try and muzzle another\ngroup's view will only increase that\ngroup's morale which is the last thing that\nthe Left want. Besides the concept of\n\"freedom of speech\" is a sensitive one to\ntoy with. John Stuart Mill,a19 th Century\nphilosopher, once wrote: \"We can never\nbe sure that the opinion we are endeavour-ing to stifle is a false opinion; and if we\nwere sure, stifling it would be an evil\nstill...\" And more recently, a computing\nPG said: \"The Left say 'We must stamp\nout Fascism'. But that's about as fascist\nas you can get!\"\nMarch saw the first FELIX Annual\nMotor Rally. The three CC U's fielded a total of seven teams (poor show RCS!). Apart from disrupting a service at St\nPaul's and brushing with the Police at\nTrafalgar Square, all went fairly smoothly.\nIronically enough, if looks could kill then\nthe eventual winners of the Rally Pot\nwould have been responsible for my demise\nseveral times over!\nNext came the Easter vacation. The\nNUS Student Journalist conference was\ninteresting and propounded certain ideas\nabout the National Press saying that many\nnational newspapers deliberately gave\nstudent activists distorted coverage just\nbecause they tended to be left-wing. Lies,\nI thought, sheer fabrication. Then came\nalong the NUS National Conference at\nLlandudno where I compared what I had\nseen and heard with what the National\nPress had to say the following day.\nNeedless to say, my attitude to those\nparticular reports went something like: \"Lies. All lies.\" Clearly my hitherto\nmoderate credentials were slightly\nnudged to the left.\nThe vac also saw the second Vacation FELIX produced under my Editorship( the\nfirst was FELL X No.361, a twelve-page\nissue produced during the summer last\nyear). The feedback I have received has\nformed the basis for the belief that the\nconcept of Vacation FELICE S presents a very real opportunity for the Union to\ninvolve its postgraduate membership. The\nstatus of the PG not only academically\nbut within the framework of the Union also is currently a sensitive issue. Who\nindeed can best represent the interests of\nPG's? The IC PGG or ICU? The sooner\nthis question is faced up to and resolved,\nthe better .\nThe third and final term menacingly\npoked its cranium over the gloomy horizon\nbringing with it the realisation that most\nof the FELIX Staff would be zapped to\ns mi there an s by impending exams. I imagined myself attempting to write the\nwhole newspaper myself and doing the\ncollating on Thursday night all on my\ntodd. (gob, sob). That left me feeling\nsemi-uncomfortable-It was something that\nI had anticipated last term and so I came\nup with the idea of producing two four-page issues per week. Each edition would\nrequire just folding with no collating . The\npractical side of this innovation worked\nfine, but my enthusiasm for the size (four\npages as opposed to the usual twelve)\nleft me slightly jaded. The last straw\ncame when someone told me that there\njust was no longer enough in the Friday\nFELIX to get them through their first\nmorning lecture. My dutiful conscience\ncould take no more, so weekly eight-page issues returned to finally eclipse\nthe session. Nevertheless, the point has\nbeen now unquestionably proven that two\nFELICE S per week can be done . It will be up to future Sabbatical editors to decide\nwhether such an idea be further exploited.\nThe result of my final project is what\nyou are looking at now: a multi colour FELIX. I expect this idea to become an\nannual event. The very real problem\nhowever with colour work is that it takes\nmuch longer to dry (as opposed to using\nblack ink) thus paste-ups have to be\nproduced well in advance. As far as I'm concerned, the novelty of multi colour work\nwas just gasping to be tried out, so there.\nI would like briefly to turn my attention\nto one or two aspects of the Union. I have\nbeen seriously concerned that too many\ngood political ideas have been thrown out\nof Union meetings simply because the\nproposer s of these ideas have had\nnegligible grounding in the art of\ncommunicating complex arguments to a sceptical audience. The concept of\npresentation comes up once again. Few\npeople recognise its potential.\nIn one respect NUS is divorced from\nthe grass root students: many of the\nspeeches made at the Lland ud no conference were theatrical performances\nof preaching to the converted which would\nhave been laughed out of the Great Hall here at IC. Political awareness has a very low coefficient within this Union,\nbut to make any headway the powers that\nbe must crawl before they can walk. This\nis a point which I believe the current\nleadership has missed. (Over to you, Mr\nTeague). This now raises the subject of\nperspective since we are constantly being\nexhorted to consider the wider species of\nthis almost metaphysical animal. I think\nit is true to say that to maintain a narrow\nperspective on a controversial issue be it\nabortion, capital punishment, women's lib, the education cuts whatever, is to be\na reactionary of the first order. Thus the\nprogressive trend is to try\" and grasp the\nwider perspective. But consider also that\nwider a perspective becomes (eg looking\nat a national conflict in the context of\nthe current international situation), the\nmore difficult, in general, it becomes to\nvisualise( and hence the more difficult\nfor someone to convince others of its\nvalidity); and once that happens, one's political education becomes susceptible\nto unsc rup ul our distortion. It is the\n\" oom plex it y breeds vulnerability\" argument all over again. But I do not wish to dwell on this for too much longer.\nIt is often said that \"facts speak for\nthemselves\". To that kind of naivety I would add \"occasionally\". Facts can\neasily be lost by a mumbling speaker and\nexaggerated by an eloquent orator (after,\nshrewd selection, naturally). The recent\nReferendum campaigns have clearly shown\nus that distortion, whether by exaggeration,\nomission or skilful l appropriation of\nemphasis is part of politicans' lives and\nanyone aspiring to such status would be\nhypocrite to deny this. Yes, it would be\ntrue to say that I am a pessimistic cynic. It reflects the extent of my\ndisillusionment.\nThis Epilogue w cul d not be complete\nwithout a few words about the I CUP res ident. Trevor Phillips has been a formidable adversary this year, often\nproving himself the master of procedure\nand debating strategy . He has occasionally publicly appeared to be very cool whilst private reports have indicated that his\nanger over a particular issue raised by\nFELIX has been intense. He has worked\nextremely hard, consistently and determined ly; his near-infinite capacity for being\nshrewd has held him in good stead in his\nnegotiations at College level. Trevor was concerned at the beginning\nof the session that any kind of defence or\nfavourable connection with FELIX might\nbe construed by his \" opponents\" as reflecting our then close friendship \u2014 such\nwas his anticipation of possible friction\nwithin the Executive . Happily, such a situation was peremptorily precluded following certain personal events which\nappear unlikely ever to be resolved fully.\nTrevor has not had an easy year. After\nmuch vehement letter-writing to FELIX in\npast years on the \"Crisis of leaders hip\"\nwithin the Union, he took office having\nstormed home in the elections with a massive 919 votes, only to find the UGMs\nas badly attended as before, rarely (if\never) broaching the 200 mark; NUS Demo\ncontingents never exceeded 70. His broadly-based ' active' support had suddenly become ' passive', almost tacit: an\nem baras sing situation to be in.\nIs hall always remember Trevor Phil lips for his ambivalence (a vestige of\nthings to come?) Whilst on the one hand\nhe has been a major inspiration as regards my own personal political education\nand the per suan ce of thoroughness and\ndiplomacy, he nevertheless, from my point\nof view, cast an uncomfortable shadow on\nFELIX. I was extremely unhappy with the\nattitude which he adopted over the question of FELIX' s sabbatical. I can now\nreveal that I have read the confidential\ndiscussion paper which Trevor presented\nto the Executive prior to the Council meeting when the decision regarding the\nFELIX sabbatical was taken. Some of\nthe assertions which he made left me in a state of supreme and total anger. Never\nbefore had I been forced to question his\nintegrity. I hope that I shall never have\nto do so again. I am still curious as to\nwhy Trevor awarded me aUG A, because\nhe and I have often begged to differ on\nirreconcilable grounds, sometimes in the\nmost vehement terms. Thus my initial\nreaction to receiving this slap on the back\nwas to reject it. But such a gesture, even\na refusal to wear the tie, would only have\nbeen considered as irrational tokenism.\nSuffice it is to say that I remain unhappy\nabout the award and curious about the\ncriteria which were used for awarding it.\n(Continued on page 9)\n\n"

    "content": "Fit IX 7\nBO at\nBlackpool\nMIKE WILLIAMS PROUDLY PRESENTS:THE EPILOGUE\nOR: Reflections on the past year\nThe past year for FELIX has been one of inexorable change . A new method of printing\nhas been adopted and the associated hassle to establish the new pattern of production\nwas anticipated, encountered and finally conquered in the difficult and protracted birth\nof what is, in essence, a new kind of FELIX. But the newness does not stop at the\nphysical appearance of the newspaper. My major criteria for the future development of\nFELIX are rooted in the past, hound in black buckram and are currently sitting on one\nof the shelves in my office quietly representing twenty-five years of student life at IC,\nwarts and all. Insofar as an innovation (as opposed to a gimmick) is a vestige of progress,\nthen it follows that FELIX has made giant strides since 1949 hence true to tradition I have been at pains to encourage innovations this year such as the Vacation Issues, the\nCareers Supplement, the Motor Rally, the Photographic Competition etc so that FELIX not only looks new but is new. But to begin at the beginning.\nCharles Lamont\nI SUPPOSE some people spend the\nweekend before their exams doing revision but for a few of us this is impossible\nbecause the annual Manchester to Black pool Veteran and Vintage Rally falls on\nthe first Sunday of June; Bo' always\ninsists on going and has to be accompanied\n(he is not yet old enough to be trusted\nalone).\nThis year we were given the daunting\ntask of attempting to retain 80% of the\navailable trophies . On arrival at the start,\nso much time was put into the polishing, in an attempt to retain the Concourse\nTrophy, that we forgot to read the\nregulations and this resulted in our\nreceiving three time faults: one for being\na minute early at the first time control,\nthe second for not being the same amount\nearly at the second, and the third for\nbeing a minute early (again) at the end.\nConfused? So were we. At the Police HQ at Hutton all the\nvehicles were put through a driving test,\nWhich as far as Bo' was concerned was\ntest of his rather minimal lock, since in order to get round the tight corners in time, even at the hands of the intrepid\nRaine, a certain amount of rear-end slide\nand opposite lock was in evidence. Even so we were still313 seconds over time\nwhich placed us about 10th out of the\n175 or so entries.\nAlthough the rules suggested that\nveterans should be loaded onto trailers\nat Hutton, we decided that it would be\nquicker to drive Bo' the remaining twenty\nmiles to Blackpool via the vintage route,\nrather than have to load up and then\nobserve the 40mph trailer towing limit.\nSome of the marshall s took quite a lot of\npersuading that although we were still\ndriving, we were no longer competing.\nMost of this part of the journey was spent\nwaving at spectators who seemed to have\ntaken the opportunity of the fine weather\nto come out in force. Next year, an automatic waving arm will have to be\ninstalled, as in Her Majesty's vehicles. After an excellent buffet luncheon on\nthe telegraph at the Norbreck Castle Hotel in Blackpool, we were expected\nto take part in an exceptionally silly procession which involved attempting to\nmake a couple of hundred elderly vehicles travel a couple of miles at less than a walking pace. Suprising though it may\nseem, the older the vehicle, the more\ndifficult this is; Bo' was the second most\nsenior entry and he registered his objection\nby soot ing his plugs but at least he did not totally loose his cool (a phenomenon\nto be noted amongst some of his juniors\nlike the 1913 All days& Onions which\nwas boiling vigorously).\nWe returned to the hotel at a suitably\nplug-cleaning spp ed to arrive first in a thoroughly unofficial race back for the\nevening gathering and our cu to mary trophy collection. An hour later, and for the next five,\nthe Dolly Sprint tender car with Bo' in close pursuit (what's that damned veteran\ncar doing on my tail? I'm doing 60!) was\nto be seen heading down the M6/MI with\n\"/ spy with my little eye\" being played\ninto the early hours of the morning and\ngetting increasingly devious, (we had to\nkeep awake \u2014 honest!)\nThe triumphant team with its two\ntrophies, (only two??) arrived at Bo's garage at 1.30 am and without further\nado went to bed (not in the garage silly. What exam at 9.30?).\nThanks to Tony Raine (tender behind)\nand Rich Gundersen (Navigator \u2014 \"Where\nand we?\" and mostly Bo'( What 30 limit?)\nfor a great weekend.\nAugust l st last year saw an enthusiastic Chemistry graduate taking the\nhelm, confident of being at least able to\nstay afloat after being thrown in at the\ndeep end. It did take me a while to\ndetermine that the previous year's regime had in advert ant ly encased my feet\nin concrete (and to my misfortune, not the\nhigh alum in ost li cate kind). / swam meth not. I did st flounder immeasurably and\nfound it grotesquely unfunny.\nThe offset-litho and its retinue of\nassociated machinery had an almost\ninfinite absorption coefficient in respect\nof the weirdest spectrum of unwelcome\ngremlins imagine able. In hindsight, I realise it would have been a hedge\nagainst inflation had I invested in a firm which manufactures aspirins. By the time the session was about to begin,\nwith the production of the Diary having\npractically done me to death, I was prepared to jack it in, throw in the towel,\nresign, kick the Union up the bum and\nlaugh all the way back to the polymer\nlabs. Sadly, some heroic demon caught\nme unawares. / was going to see it through\ncome hell or high water.\nThe first term as in any kind of self-perpetuating, connected series had its\nunusual even extreme beginnings. The Fresher s' Issue was a total pain in the\nnau s. Imagine the scene at midnight the\nFriday before the beginning of term. The litho-operator is hanging around waiting\nto run the last plate which happens to be\nthe cover. The front page is a headline,\none story (\"Refectory Prices Up 17 Per\nCent\")and the rest blank. I am frantically\nvar i typing another story (\"Copulation: a Union Discipline Offence?\"). I 'ts done,\ntitled islet ra sett ed,it's all pasted-up\nand it's2 am. There's still a nice big space in the middle to fill. The litho-operator is getting impatient. Suddenly a flash of gross inspiration: \"How about\nspace-filling with FELIX WELCOMES\nFRESHERS'?\" Pause. Sound effects\ndenotes severe honking. But there's no\nother choice. So it goes in. Elsewhere, e goes were strutting\n(especially when drunk), grand postures\nwere being struck and haughty affectations\nof status glibly glided from bubble to\nbubble. This was IC at its most entertain-ing. The competitive spirit was fresh and\naggressive and morale was high. New ground was effortlessly being covered\ndaily. And there was the Editor, his concrete socks only just beginning to\nchip away, down at the deep end. Say aloud in an accusing voice: \"Why\nis FELIX such an insignificant size?\nWhy are the photos so crummy? What do\nyou mean, there's been machine trouble?\nWhat are the so-called production\ndifficulties? Why the hell haven't you\nprinted our sports reports? What does\n'opportunist' mean? Just what do you do\nwith your sabbatical time, eh? What do\nyou mean you haven't got time to produce\nand distribute those UGM posters? The\nUnion Publicity had better be done by\ntomorrow \u2014 or else!\" Aggression was in the ascendant .Delete ' letterpress'; insert\n' offset litho'; now consider the\nramifications of producing a publication\nyourself on the premises. Don't think too\nhard, your brain will get zapped through\nsevere overwork. I am unable to avoid\nbeing angered by the concept of intolerance\non such a wide scale. The first term saw FELIX celebrate\nits Silver Anniversary . Barring the banana\nfritter (titter titter) the commemorative\ndinner was a great success with seventy\npeople attending, eight of which were\npast Editors. The 25th Anniversary issue was an ambitious project which only just made it, but it nevertheless paid off handsomely .\nThe intention was to make it a collector's item with the silver banner and trimmings,\ntwenty pages, gold heavyweight cover and\nwith plates containing photographs being\nmade professionally in Chancery Lane. The fact that every one of the approximately 2,800 copies produced disappeared\nin record time is some measure of\nachievement.\nThe second term started off innocuously\nenough with the hassle of producing a Careers Supplement. This was only a moderate success in terms of advertising\nrevenue but the feedback on the idea has\nbeen very encouraging. Two other notable\nthings happened during January. Firstly, after the Union finally saw sense and relieved me of my duties as\nPublicity Officer, the subject was raised\nat the following Council. This provoked\na subsequent discussion where all and\nsundry eagerly expressed their discontent\nwith my handling of the Union publicity.\nBut more importantly it highlighted\ncertain prejudices and areas of total\nignorance which 1 immediately became\ndetermined to overcome.\nBy now my concrete socks were\nshowing signs of cracking .Sooner or later\nI would be able to hold my own in the\ndeep end. It was bound to happen eventually, but would it happen in time?\nSecondly, the controversial topic of\nthe Third Sabbatical was ominously\nraised. The ICU President understandably\ntried to underplay the idea of re allocating\nthe FELIX Sabbatical by briefly\nintroducing the topic as a kind of postscript to the President's business. Indeed\nhis words at the time were: \" . . . and Council may have to take a decision on\nthis matter.\" (My emphasis in italic). The effect of that announcement was electric;( continued page 8)\n\n"
