    "content": "Rethink Rubbish: Reuse and Recycle\nenvironment\nEvery 8 days, London produces enough rubbish to fill Canary Wharf. With worldwide carbon emissions soaring, it\u2019s time for Imperial to rethink its Environmental Policy.\n10\nfelix\nThursday 17 November 2005\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nI apologise in advance for having to\nsay this, but there\u2019s no other way.\nImperial College has turned out to\nbe a major disappointment. Coming\nfrom a small college in the west of\nIreland, where progress on environmental issues was slow, I had\ngreat expectations that this college,\nas such a major university in the\ninternational scene, would be in a\ncompletely different league. Sadly, it\ndid not take me long to realise that\nthings here are no better. Despite\nits reputation as one of the foremost\ncolleges in engineering, medicine\nand sciences, it fails miserably in its\nmost simple and domestic of duties;\nits disposal of waste, and its dependence on energy. Its hosting of an\nEnvironmental MSc of international\nrenown and its support of numerous initiatives focused on improving environmental standards in the\noutside world, only serve to make\nits own lack of regard to its environmental duties all the more inexplica-ble, if not ironic.\nWalking around the campus, one\ncan\u2019t help but notice the wastage.\nBins are full of plastic drink bottles,\naluminium cans and newspapers,\nall good recycling material. Indeed,\nit was calculated last year that 73%\nof the current waste stream is recy-clable, with a further 16% of material\nbeing compostable. But very little\nso far has actually been done.\nAt present, practically all of the\nwasteistakenoff-sitebyWestminster\nCity Council and incinerated, at\nSouth East London Combined Heat\nand Power plant. Incineration has\nits advantages over landfilling in\nmany aspects, including the recovery of energy and the reduction of\nvolume of waste to 10%. However,\nthe South East London plant has\nissues of its own. Recently, concerns\nabout air pollution and poor human\nhealth have prompted the local\nhealth authority (at Lewisham) to\ncarry out a health assessment study,\nwhich is still due to be published.\nImperial have a duty of care under\nthe Environmental Protection Act\nto give due consideration to where\ntheir waste is going and if it is being\ntreated properly.\nSome efforts have been made to\npromote recycling but have not been\nmet with much success. An attempt\nwas made to initiate paper recycling\nin administration offices around the\ncollege has largely been unsuccess-ful, due to poor participation rates\noften because of the lack of recycling points in appropriate locations.\nAnother scheme to recycle glass in\nthe Sherfield canteen again is only\na partial success due to a misunderstanding by staff of what was\nrequired by them.\nThese highlight some of the difficulties of bringing in recycling\nschemes. That even when the infrastructure is in place, how do you\nensure that people will use them\nproperly? The answer is culture\nchange. And it is not as difficult as it\nseems. The college provides excellent training to all people starting\ncollege on how to use the various\nfacilities from the library to sports\nfacilities. Therefore, it is not too\nmuch more of a step to include\ntraining on the practice of good\nrecycling habits at the beginning of\nthe year. This has to be supported\nby the ubiquitous presence of recycling stations with comprehensive\nlabelling of bins. Such a change was\nbrought into Norwich University\nonly a short time ago, and it has\nbeen recently identified as a leader\nin ground management programs.\nThe key to success was educating\nstudents as soon as they entered the\ncollege, and providing the facilities\nfor them to recycle. Once people\nrealise it is the norm, they will not\nbe long in participating.\nThe college also has to ask itself\nwhy so much waste is created. Why\nis it that every canteen on campus\nonly gives disposable drinking glasses and that plates in the union after\na certain time are all paper. It is not\njust a case of logistics, as numerous\nother institutions and colleges do\nnot have the same issue. It is to do\nwith policy. The absence of a clear\ncommitment from management\ntowards environmental sustainability is providing the wrong signals\nto every sector within the college,\nincluding the catering sector, as well\nas staff and students.\nThe other major area for concern\nis energy use. Imperial recently\nbecame subject to the carbon emission scheme which means it has\nbeen granted a certain cap of energy\nusage that emits carbon. This figure is due to diminish in the future\nyears in line with Kyoto Agreements\nto reduce carbon emissions. If the\ncollege does not decrease its carbon\nemissions in line with these reduc-tions, it will have to make up the\nshort fall by buying carbon credits\nfrom institutions that have credits to spare. At this early stage\nof the scheme, there is no saying\nhow much these credits will cost;\nthey will be subject to normal market forces. Thus the college may\nwell find itself having to spend large\namounts of money, money which\ncomes from students amongst other\nplaces, as a penalty for not being\nenergy efficient. This could damage its ability to pay and entice the\nhighest quality of staff for which the\ncollege is known, and reduce the\nservice given to students in return\nfor their custom.\nBut here I will stop. I did not\nintend this to be the habitual col-lege-bashing, mud-slinging routine.\nThe college has been and continues\nto be involved in numerous laudable\nschemes dedicated to promoting\nbetter environmental performance.\nLast week the college launched\nthe Energy Futures Lab based at\nImperial which is to support major\nresearch into future energy options,\nwhich should be seen as a very positive development. A part of this is\nwill look into how much a city could\nbenefit if it were to optimise its use\nof resources such as power, heat-ing, transport and water. It gave\nthe example of \u201cheating homes with\nthe heat from waste water.\u201d This is\nprecisely the type of thinking and\nattitude that is needed to face the\nenvironmental challenges ahead of\nus, and it is encouraging to see our\nmanagement being so supportive.\nAnd the college, I\u2019m sure, has it\nwithin itself to go even further. By\nlooking inwards to its own practices,\nImperial can demonstrate the practicalities of its initiatives, by showcasing them on its own campus,\nrestoring itself to position of one\nof the world leaders in technology\nmatters.\nThe college needs to formulate a\nclear environmental policy that will\ndictate the strategy and approach\nto be taken over the coming years.\nWithin this would be the commitment to reduce waste production\nand to establish recycling schemes\nfor key materials and thus reducing its dependence on landfill. This\nwould all be part of a college-wide\nculture change brought in at the\nstart of the next academic year.\nThe college could follow its close\nrivals at Oxford and Cambridge in\nrenegotiating its next energy contract to reduce its use of fossil fuels\nand obtain its energy from \u2018green\u2019\nsources such as solar, wind and\nhydro-electric. Though this may not\nnecessarily affect its carbon emissions trading, it would send out the\nright signals and provide some small\nimpetus for those industries.\nAnd it can\u2019t just all be down to\nmanagement. We all, as students,\nhave to a duty to communicate our\nconcerns to our own representa-tives, through the Student Union,\nand our various academic depart-ments. Change can\u2019t be always left\nonly on the square shoulders of our\nRector, nor on a bunch of \u2018lefties\u2019\nin Esoc and the Environmental\nDepartment. We all stand to benefit\nfrom a change in our practices. If\nthere were to be at least change\nin attitude towards environmental\npractice in the short year I have\nhere, brought about by a serious\neffort by students and staff to communicate the problem, this will have\nbeen a major step forward. And you\nnever know, if that were to happen, I\nmight not even feel this college has\nbeen such a disappointment.\nWhat you can do: recycling in your borough www.recyclenow.com\nAndrew McConville\nStudent, Centre of Environmental\nPolicy\n\u201cChange can\u2019t always\nbe left only on the\nsquare shoulders of\nour Rector, nor on a\nbunch of \u2018lefties\u2019 in\nEsoc\u201d\nWant more answers?

The\nQAA, the organisation responsible\nfor improving standards in higher\neducation, seems to have doubts as\nto how UL can award degrees when\nit has nothing to do with teaching\nor setting the standards for them.\nThese doubts have led to the QAA\nrefusing to give the university a vote\nof broad confidence.\nThe University of London\u2019s vice-chancellor, Sir Graeme Davies, has\nentered into talks with the QAA to\ntry and convince them to give the\nuniversity a vote of confidence. If\nthe QAA decide not to, the UL\n\u2019s\ninternational reputation would be\nbadly damaged, which may cause\nmany of the colleges that make up\nthe UL to breakaway.\nThe QAA, while approving of\nthe quality of degrees awarded\nby the constituent colleges of UL,\nis unsure of the university\u2019s precise role in awarding degrees. Sir\nGraeme believes that the QAA has\nnot understood how the university\nis structured: \u201cThere has been a\nmisunderstanding of how the federal university works. The university\nis the colleges and the colleges are\nthe university\u201d is how Sir Graeme\nexplains it. He argues that if the\nQAA are satisfied with the colleges\nthen that should extend to the rest\nof the university. He believes that\nit is immaterial who awards the\ndegree as long as the degree is of a\nhigh standard.\nProponents of Imperial\u2019s separation from UL might disagree. It\ncould be argued that a degree from\nImperial will be better recognised\nby potential employers than a UL\ndegree. It is unlikely that Imperial\u2019s\nreputation as an institution would\nbe affected by the change.\nImperial\u2019s most senior committee meets on December 9th to\ndecide whether Imperial will award\nits own degrees; the future of the\nUniversity of London is in the bal-ance. If QAA does not give a vote\nof confidence to UL and Imperial\ndecides to effectively leave the uni-versity, it\u2019s unlikely that UL will live\nto see out 170 years.\nRyan Dee\nIn last week\u2019s Felix (1334) we stated\nthat the University of Kent was taking over at Imperial\u2019s Wye cam-pus. However, Professor Leszek\nBorysiewicz, Deputy Rector of\nImperial College, has told Felix that\n\u201cWye continues to be an important\npart of the College and we remain\ncommitted to it for the long-term.\nWhile the Faculty of Life Sciences\nclosed down land-based courses\nthere due to financial necessity, a\nseparate review is examining other\nways in which the campus can be\nbest used\u201d.\nImperial is currently in discussion\nwith the University of Kent over\nthe delivery of Applied Business\nManagement (ABM), the only undergraduate course currently recruiting at Wye. The proposal, which is\nsubject to ratification by the governing bodies of both institutions, states\nthat the 2007 student intake on this\ncourse would be taught by Kent and\nImperial staff on the Wye campus,\nunder appropriate financial agree-ments.\nNew students enrolling from\n2007 would receive a University of\nKent degree and, in recognition of\nImperial\u2019s ongoing involvement,\nAssociateship of Wye College.\nExisting ABM students \u2013 and those\naccepted for a place in 2006 \u2013 would\ncontinue to receive a University of\nLondon degree and Associateship\nof the Royal College of Science from\nImperial. ABM academic staff based\nat Wye would transfer to University\nof Kent, but retain honorary links\nwith Imperial. This agreement covers only the ABM degree and does\nnot alter Imperial\u2019s continued presence at the Wye campus.\nContrary to Wye students complaints of poor communication from\nCollege, Sir Leszek said, \u201cStudent\nunion representatives have been\nconsulted by the Faculty of Life\nSciences.\u201d\nIs the end nigh for the\nUniversity of London?\ncontinued from page 1\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWye update\npropriate as he made the comments\nbefore he came into office. Musatafa\nArif, former President of ICU said,\n\u201cit would set a dangerous precedent\nto no confidence people on stuff that\nhappened before they came into\noffice\u201d. However, other delegates\nsuggested that someone with such\nextreme views is not suitable to represent a diverse body of students.\nMany delegates questioned why\nit had taken Manfredi so long to\nissue an apology. Chris Heathcoate\nfrom LSE asked whether he was\n\u201cdoing it to keep your job, or do you\nmean it?\u201d. Manfredi said he was\nnot doing it \u201cjust too hang onto my\njob\u201d, but later in the Malet street\nbar he admitted his apology was\n\u201call bullshit\u201d.\nThe motion was passed with 27\nvotes in favour of the motion, 5 delegates voted against, one of whom\nwas Mustafa Arif. Sarah Khatib,\nICU Deputy President (Education\n& Welfare) was among 5 delegates\nwho abstained from voting. For the\nmotion to pass a two-thirds majority\nwas required so in effect an abstention is a vote against as each abstention reduces the fraction of votes in\nfavour of the motion.\nAlon Or-bach, of Imperial,\nexpressed dismay at Khatib\u2019s\ndecision to abstain, \u201cWe elect our\nWelfare Officers to take a stand\nagainst discrimination in all its\nforms. Abstaining from a vote of no\nconfidence in the ULU Chair who\nhas made homophobic remarks,\nmaking it easier for the motion to\nbe defeated, is a neglect of duty.\nOur Welfare Officers should be passionate advocates of equality in our\nuniversities; we don\u2019t expect them to\nstand back and plead impartiality.\u201d\nSameena Misbahuddin, Imperial\nCollege Union President, who was\nnot present and therefore could not\nvote on the issue told Felix, \u201cto make\nsuch comments as he did against\nany part of community is unaccept-able, - especially for someone holding a position like he does.\u201d\nNo con\ufb01dence in homophobe\nCouncil have No Confidence in Luca \u2018I would kill my gay son\u2019 Manfredi\nThe QAA has refused to give ULU\na vote of broad confidence.\nLeader, page 19\n\n"

Fun and good nights are guar-anteed.\nSECTION B\n- Catch up with all your work. Run to the\nlibrary straight after the first, pick up 5 books on\nthe subjects you were taught and learn them all\nby heart! After a few weeks your lecturers are\ngoing to love you and offer you their jobs.\n- Don\u2019t waste time with all that making friends\nbullshit, playing sports, going out or the opposite\nsex.

The Brown\nCouch team tried to find out.\nThe new film \u201cWallace and Gromit in The\nCurse of the Were-Rabbit\u201d took audiences by\nstorm after its release in October. Widely said to\nbe \u201cas good as\u201d or \u201cslightly better than\u201d the earlier films, the Rector\u2019s position seems entirely\ntenable. Since the announcement was made,\nthere has been a furious outcry from the great\nunconsulted.\nThe staff and students argue that since the\nRector is part of College, any decision, from\ntrivial merging of faculties to \u201cwhat\u2019s hot and\nwhat\u2019s not\u201d at the local cinema should be made\nwith full consultation. One member of the Union\nsuggested \u201cEvery student should have a say in\nevery decision the Rector makes - especially big\nones like this. Imperial is a very diverse college\nand not everyone will like the comic antics of a\ndog and man double act.\u201d\nSameena Misbahuuddinn, Imperial Collge\nUnion President said recently: \u201cAfter everything\nthat happened last year with students not being\ninformed\u201d ... \u201cthis is another example of College\nnot informing us of what is happening and the\neffects that it could have on students.\u201d\nThe mad fuss that welled up yesterday forced\nthe college administration to host a press confer-ence. Here the Rector attempted to justify his\nposition. He first pointed out that many Imperial\nstudents and staff have seen the film and are in\nagreement with his views. He drew attention to\nthe vital statistics: \u201cover 1,100 staff,. 2,700 under-graduates, and over 680 PhD students [have\nseen the film]\u201d. He also said he found it \u201ccompelling and exciting\u201d. We can only speculate that he\nis referring to the plane chase towards the end\nof the movie.\nA statement was read out: \u201cThe opening of\nthe film [in which Wallace uses an assortment of\ngadetry to get ready for work] shows such innovation that it will surely serve as an inspiration\nto all our engineers and scientists. It is partly\nfor this reason that we fully support the Rector\u2019s\nview that \u2018the film is quite good\u2019.\u201d\nMaybe not apocalypse now, nor the day after\ntomorrow, but perhaps by the time Sir Richard\noversees a merger of Wallace and Gromit, we\u2019ll\nbe a little closer to a democratic system.\nCrackin\u2019 cheese gets stamp of approval\nBrown Couch\n20\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 17 November 2005\nS\nometimes I feel like I\u2019m turning into my\nmother; patronising the \u201ctimes of today\u201d\nas though my era were so much better.\nI\u2019m not that old, but I have to deplore\ntoday\u2019s society when 15-year-olds are being\nstabbed in school. For no reason other than for a\nfew kicks, pardon the pun.\nThe school\u2019s principal had this to say: \u201cThe\nschool has a very clear, well established anti-bul-lying policy. It is a shocking and appalling incident and it has shocked the whole college community.\u201d Of course it\u2019s an awful incident! Why\ndon\u2019t you focus on that as opposed to defending\nsomething that so evidently happens? The anti-bullying policy is clearly not being implemented\nvery well, is it? I doubt the first port of call for\nthe bullies was to stab this poor girl; they must\nhave been after her for a while.\nEvery time a child in this country is stabbed\nor beaten to death by his \u2018schoolmates\u2019, all they\ncan do is a bit of \u2018soul searching\u2019 as opposed to\nconfronting the problem. \u201cHow could it have\nhappened here?\u201d they ask. Because it\u2019s been\ngoing on forever, that\u2019s how! It\u2019s almost as if they\nhave no memory of their own schooldays and are\ncompletely blind to the cruelty around them.\nChildren are no more angels than the rest of\nus. Like most other human-beings, they\u2019re not\neven on the same level as animals. An animal\nwill hurt you for survival, a human-being will\nhurt you for fun. What remarkable role models\nwe all are to the youth of today. I wonder how\nmany children have seen fox hunters parading\ntheir silly selves on television, out rightly undermining the authority of the Government, thinking that antisocial behaviour is OK in the name\nof sport.\nMany, if not most, British schools (fee-paying,\nor not) are host to chronic, petty violence. If you\nare a parent or a teacher with the necessary\ntime and patience you can really love, educate\nand discipline children out of their inherent evil,\nbut it\u2019s much easier to pretend that it isn\u2019t there,\nor to temporarily suppress its worst manifesta-tions.\nI\u2019ve seen generations of bullying in action.\nI only have to walk up and down Caledonian\nRoad a few times to see the local chavs pick on\nanybody not dressed as ridiculously as them. I,\nmyself, got rather Biblically stoned at primary\nschool, once upon a time. Of course, my wonderfully supportive school imparted only the best of\npunishments: they put the perpetrators\u2019 names\nin the infamous \u201cblack book\u201d. This cycle of inane\nbullying and punishment continued for a few\nmonths, until my parents eventually conceded\nand told me I could fight back. Needless to say,\nafter I bit the little fiends, they never touched me\nagain. Typically, I was punished for my actions\nwhilst the bullies continued their reign of terror\non the playground.\nI still get the feeling that nobody knows how\nto handle such a senseless crime. Perhaps they\ndon\u2019t know how to handle it because they continuously deny that it happens. In the same vein\nthat parents who will readily believe their child\nis a gem yet refuse to believe they\u2019re capable\nof stealing, schools want to believe they are the\nepitome of perfection and bullying isn\u2019t an issue.\nMost schools don\u2019t even provide somebody that\na child can turn to. Teachers will either refuse\nto take anything said seriously (\u201cjust ignore it\u201d\nand \u201cstop being so silly\u201d are common deterring,\npatronising phrases that they come out with) or,\nif they happen to see bullying in action, fear of\nbeing attacked themselves or losing their jobs\nstops them from intervening. Parents of the victim can only do so much about an environment\nthat they aren\u2019t in on a day to day basis, and parents of the bully refuse to believe their child is\nflawed. Then, finally, when a child is attacked on\nschool grounds, schools will seek to blame everything but themselves: television, video games,\nmusic, parents and even Marylin Manson, to\nname a few.\nWhy is bullying turned into such a non-issue?\nIs it because it\u2019s conducted by children, the\nworld\u2019s little angels? It\u2019s time to wake up to the\nfact that kids are growing up much faster these\ndays, taking on both the good and bad points of\nadulthood. If schools are going to be handing\nout condoms to 12-year-olds, they shouldn\u2019t need\nto worry about holding those same 12-year-olds\naccountable for their actions. They want to grow\nup faster? Fine, let them grow up and face the\nrules and laws of the society we live in. If they do\nsomething wrong, then they need to be brought\nto trial and punished for their actions. That\u2019ll\nteach them to have underage sex and stab people in the eye.\nStop hiding from bullying and face up to it.\nThe more something is taboo, the worse it\u2019ll\nget behind those annoying closed doors. Bring\neverything out into the open. Children who bully\nshould be named and shamed within the school.\nLet them face the embarrassment that all other,\nmore grown-up, criminals face. Let them face\nthe same trials and punishments, and give their\nvictims some justice. Give teachers a safe working environment by allowing them to defend\nthemselves and their pupils without fear of pros-ecution. If children want to act like adults, by\nall means, just let them. They\u2019ll soon go back to\nplaying with their toys when they learn the bad\nisn\u2019t as fun as the good.\n\n"

    "content": "Hannah Theodorou\nFood & Drink Editor\nAll-in-one fry up\nA full fry up is the most impressive\nitem to be presented with in the\nmorning, though it can be a hassle\nto organise; yolks go hard while\nyou save the toast from burning\nand bacon gets left under the grill\nby accident. Jamie Oliver came up\nwith the perfect solution: frying it\nall in the same pan. Not only does it\nmake cooking easier, washing up is\na doddle too.\nsausages\nsliced mushrooms\neggs\ntomatoes, cut in half\nsalt and pepper\nbacon\ndrizzle of vegetable oil\n1. Heat a large frying pan. Cut\nhowever many sausages you want\nin half lengthways and cook for a\nfew minutes until they lose some of\ntheir pinkness. Place to the side of\nthe pan.\n2. Drizzle a bit of oil on the\nother side of the pan and fry the\nmushrooms for a few minutes. Push\nthem to the side of the pan with the\nsausage.\n3.Place a few strips of bacon and\nsome tomato halves in the pan\nand fry until the bacon gets crispy.\nTurn and repeat until the other side\ncrisps up as well. By this stage the\ntomatoes should have softened.\nW\nhilst nursing the inevitably fierce hangover\nthat followed a particularly debaucher-ous Felix bar night, I\ndecided to dedicate the entire food\nsection to hangover cures, particularly the ubiquitous fry-up. Ping and\nPaul have once again been sent off\nto various greasy spoons to assault\ntheir waist-lines for valuable ratings\nthat will, hopefully, save some of\nyou spending money needlessly on a\npoor fry-up. In the meantime I stuck\nto good old home cooking.\nFor most students at Imperial,\nmornings involve a last-minute dash\nto college with breakfast being a\nluxury for only the best of timekeepers or those that favour it over a\nshower. Cereal and toast are the\nnorm for most, although in halls a\nfriendly German student would happily munch away on German sausage and krispbread every morning.\nMany of us just tolerate our grumbling stomachs until we get a chance\nto grab a pastry in the break.\nOn the weekend, however, everything changes. You can leisurely\ntumble out of bed at midday with a\nthrobbing head and stumble to the\nkitchen whilst trying to avoid any\nmirrors for a strong cup of tea and a\ngood rummage in the fridge.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nhis week we tackle a monstrous hangover with fry-ups, cups of tea and muesli\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfood & drink\nhe morning after the night before\nThink you could Jamie or\nDelia a run for their money?\nWe\u2019re looking for new and\nexciting recipes and reviews\nof restaurants. Email food.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk if you\nwant to get involved. There\nmay even be a free dinner or\ntwo thrown into the deal......\n4. Shuffle round the contents of the\nfrying pan so everything is evenly\narranged and then crack 3 or 4 eggs\naround the pan so they dribble out\nbetween all the other items and help\neverything stick together. Leave on\na low heat for a few minutes until\nthe eggs are done to your liking- you\nmay want to place the pan under a\nhot grill to finish off the yolks.\n5. Slide out onto a plate, cut into\nportions and serve with buttered\ntoast.\nPerfect poached eggs\nI\u2019ve never been a big fan of fried\neggs for breakfast, although I\u2019ll happily dip my chips in one at dinner\ntime. I think everyone should try\npoached eggs at least once. They\ntaste great from an egg poacher,\nbut because they\u2019re expensive and a\npain to clean not even I own one. A\nlarge frying pan or wok will always\nsuffice.\n1 or more fresh eggs\nsalt and pepper to season\n1. Pour boiling water into a frying\npan or wok placed over a high heat\nuntil it is about 3 inches deep.\n2. When bubbles start appearing\non the bottom of the pan it is ready\nfor the eggs. Crack them into the\nwater carefully, or alternatively\ncrack them into a cup and pour into\nthe water. The white should turn\nopaque instantly if the water is hot\nenough.\n3. Leave for 3 minutes if you like a\nsoft yolk, or 5 if you prefer a harder\nyolk. Dish out with a slice or a fork\nand either serve straight away on\ntoast or pat dry on kitchen towel\nif you\u2019re worried it\u2019s too watery.\nSeason with salt and pepper and eat\ninstantly on toast.\nYoghurt with muesli\nIf you really don\u2019t think your stomach can handle eggs or sausage\nwhen you have a hangover, I have\nfound a suitable non-nauseating yet\nfilling alternative perfect for weekdays as well.\n1 portion muesli,\n4 tablespoons greek yoghurt\nsplash of orange juice (optional)\n1. Add the yoghurt to the muesli,\nstirring until it is all mixed. If you\nfeel it\u2019s too thick for you add a few\nsplashes of orange juice which also\nperks up the flavour. Add any other\nfruit you fancy: chopped banana or\napples, blueberries, strawberries...\nthe list goes on. A teaspoon of honey\nis always a nice addition.\nHair of the dog\nEating to raise your blood sugar levels is all very well, but even doctors\nwill admit the best way to get rid of\na hangover is to turn to \u2018the hair of\nthe dog that bit you\u2019. What drinking more alcohol the next day does\nis effectively get you pissed again,\nnumbing the pain of the hangover\nin the process. Try alcohol with fruit\njuice; Bloody Marys (vodka, tomato\njuice, Worcestershire sauce, tabas-co) are perfect although anything\nwith orange juice will boost your\nvitamin C levels to boot.\nAbove all though, avoidance is\nalways better than cure. Make sure\nyour friends pour a gallon of water\ndown your throat before you pass\nout. Failing that get a medic friend\nto hook you up to an IV line the next\nday. CD-UK often helps too.\nYou\u2019re probably all too familiar with\nwaking up on a Sunday morning\nalone, cold and hung-over. In need\nof a proven hangover cure and some\neye candy to raise the old body tem-perature? Then Ping & Paul have\nthe answer....\nCaf\u00e9 Milan, 23 Old Brompton\nRoad, London , SW7 3HZ\nBacon,Sausage,Beans,Scrambled\negg, Mushrooms, Toast, Tea\nRating 7/10\nOpens really late on Sundays for\nsome strange reason... it took us a\nwhile to figure this out, but being\nright next to the Lamborghini show-room, the food should have racing\npedigree.\nAnd indeed the food service here\nwas quick and the food looked\nappealing. I\u2019m not sure that the\nwhole thing wasn\u2019t microwaved, the\nsausages lacked any tell-tale frying\nburns and were a worrying shade\nof pink. The rest of the breakfast\nwas pretty standard, but they don\u2019t\ndo fried eggs, making us think the\nscrambled eggs probably come\nfrom powder. The toast here though,\nwas the best of any of the caf\u00e9\u2019s\nwe\u2019ve reviewed. Toasted in a panini\nmachine and buttered rather than\nmargarined, I would go back just to\norder extra toast.\nAgain the waitresses grumble at\nyou in some foreign language, but\nwhat the hell, 2/3 of all communication is via body language.\nBenjys, 157 Earls Court Road,\nLondon, SW5 9RQ\nBuilder\u2019s Breakfast \u00a33.70 \u2013 2 bacon,\n2 sausages, egg, beans, toast, chips,\nunlimited tea or coffee\nRating 9.5/10\nThe food here is not of the highest quality, nor is the restaurant\nas fancy as some of its South Ken\ncounterparts but Benjys is the pure\ndefinition of a greasy spoon caf\u00e9. It\ncan be smoky, and full of random-ers, but if you appreciate a proper\nbreakfast then this is the only place\nfor you. Likewise, the waitresses\nhere aren\u2019t leggy blondes, are liable\nto grumble at you in some eastern\nEuropean language, but first thing\nin the morning, there is no prettier\nsight. The waitresses are friendly,\npetite, eager to serve (food) and\nbelievers of quick service. Go there\nfor an entire year ordering no beans\nand an extra egg and eventually\neven the fittest (worst) waitress will\nrecognise you and remember your\norder.\nHaving lived in Earl\u2019s Court last\nyear, once we had found this place\nthere was never the need to eat anywhere else. They cater to all sizes of\nappetite, from \u2018standard\u2019 breakfast\nto the house speciality and my personal favourite, the \u2018builders\u2019 breakfast \u2013 the only meal you will need to\nlast you about a week. Two rashers\nof bacon, two sausages, fried egg,\nbeans, 2 slices of toast, chips and\nunlimited tea.\nCan you feel the love?\nCaf\u00e9 Primo, Old Brompton Road,\nSouth Kensington\n\u00a34.50 \u2013 Spanish Omelette\nRating 5.5/10\nI admit it \u2013 this caf\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t qualify for direct comparison because it\ndoesn\u2019t offer full breakfasts, but this\nis the one with the incredibly perfect\nwaitress, so I just couldn\u2019t walk on\nby this time.\nIts prices are definitely SW7,\nas is the swanky modern decor.\nThe outside decking area would\nbe nice in summer, but on a cold\nNovember morning I was wishing\nI was indoors. I\u2019m pretty sure that\nSpanish omelette normally means\na big thick omelette with potato in\nit, rather than an eggy mush of peppers and ham... but it was nice, and\nwas served with a side salad, which\nis certainly a healthier alternative\nthan my usual fry-up.\nOn the down side, the service was\nslow (there was even time to go\nbuy Ben\u2019s Cookies from across the\nstreet to stop our stomachs digesting themselves) and we managed\nto get a new waitress on her second\nThe Breakfast Club\nwith Ping and Paul\nToast at Caf\u00e9 Milan: griddled and buttered to perfection\nday who was confused the whole\ntime. The pain au chocolat could\nhave been Tesco value, and wasn\u2019t\neven warm. I wished I had gone to\nthe JCR for that instead.\nWe didn\u2019t get to see that J-Lo lookalike waitress until we were just\nabout to leave. But it made our day,\nand improved the caf\u00e9\u2019s rating.\nIn light of our deteriorating health,\nand shape..... we\u2019re taking a break\nfrom fry-ups, and the next review\nwill be exploring more healthier\ncuisines.\n11\nfelix\nThursday 17 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nSo November is here, the clocks\nhave turned back, the days draw\nshorter and the wind blows colder.\nEvery foreign student is now asking\nthemselves why they chose to study\non such a cold barren island as\nBritain when they could be in sunny\nGreece or wherever they\u2019ve come\nfrom. What better music to capture\nthe mood then, or so I thought when\nI picked up a copy of The Crimea\u2019s\nlatest album. With the title, Tragedy\nRocks and track titles such as Bad\nVibrations, Miserablist Tango and\nSomeone\u2019s Crying, I was sure that\nit would be great accompaniment\nto the season\u2019s melancholy. But\noh how wrong I was, this albums\nis tragic, but for all the wrong rea-sons.\nThe album starts of promisingly\nenough, with a delicate minor-key\nwaltzlike piano solo opening up the\nfirst track, White Russian Galaxy.\nIt pulls you into a trap of thinking\nthis album is going to be something\ndifferent. But 30 seconds on, and\nit fades, only to be replaced by the\nmost boring pedestrian indie riff,\nand a lead singer with a bland and\nyet annoying voice. This shift from\npiano waltz to anodyne indie pop\nis probably the worst thing on this\nalbum, god knows why they thought\nit would be good idea to put it as the\nfirst track or indeed, on the album\nat all.\nAlthough the rest of this album\nis better than that ground zero\nmoment, that really does not say a\nlot. The rest of the album carries\non with the boring indie pop theme,\nwhich fails totally in trying to convey\nthe images associated with its bleak\ntrack titles and lyrics, and remains\nabout as adventurous as an Adam\nSandler movie. Still, it\u2019s not all bad,\nthere are a few relatively good tracks\non the album, the best of which is\nprobably Gazillions Of Miniature\nViolins. Unlike most of the other\ntracks on the album, it takes on a\nmore expansive sound, creating a\nlush soundscape and breaking the\nmonotony which seems to permeate\nthroughout the album. It\u2019s a shame\nthen, that the lead singer tries his\nhardest to wreck it, with his stupid\nvoice, as with every other track on\nthe album.\nIn conclusion, there is really no\npoint in getting this album, or any\nreal point to the album itself. There\nis absolutely nothing special about\nthis album, the vast majority of\ntracks are plain, pedestrian, unin-teresting, and can be found ad infinitum throughout the history of music.\nNothing separates this band from\nthe sea of mediocrity which can be\nfound in any provincial town\u2019s local\nband scene. The only good points\non this album is when the band\ntry something different, but these\nmoments too rare and far between.\nSure, there are a few decent tracks\non this album, but it really isn\u2019t\nworth your time, money or effort in\nfinding them. Tragic indeed.\nHan Yip\nBefore you read this, I feel obliged\nto let you know that I love, no adore\nBlink-182. I grew up with them, listened to little but them when I was\nyoung and na\u00efve, and as a result the\nfollowing may be a little biased and\nnon-objective, but never mind.\nSo, Blink-182 have a Greatest\nHits album, one last money making opportunity since their hiatus\nturned split. This album, with its\nchronological order is perfect for\nthose who only jumped on the Blink\nbandwagon post-All The Small\nThings and shows what a transformation this band made lyrically,\nmusically and most noticeably the\nlevel of maturity throughout their\ncareer.\nCarousel is the perfect opening\ntrack, and along with M+M, are\nrepresentative of how raw and simple the band were when they were\nstarting out, and approximately\nthe correct age for the songs they\nwere singing. By Enema Of The\nState and Take Off Your Pants And\nJacket, there was something slightly strange about a nearly 30 year-old\nman singing about being a teenager,\nhowever that is how Blink-182 had\nsuch a devout teenage following-songs you could relate to and songs\nthat planted the appealing thought\nin your mind that you too could be\nyoung forever.\nThen they came along with their\neponymous album, got married and\nhad kids, and started singing about\nthings that weren\u2019t funny any more.\nThat\u2019s where they lost it for me,\nhowever, seemed to gain a new set\nof fans with their mature stance\non pop-punk. As a result, most of\nthe material included on this album\nis from their latest album, with\nnoticeable absences of Mutt, Rich\nLips and Going Away To College.\nAdditionally, there is no secret or\nsurprise \u2018new\u2019 track, just one last\nfresh taste of a mediocre radio version of Go.\nBefore Blink-182, there was Green\nDay. Now we have Green Day again\nand don\u2019t really need Blink-182 any-more. It\u2019s no loss, their Greatest\nHits is a lovely way to say goodbye\nJenny Gibson\nI waited four years for this album so\nit was pretty likely that the actual\nsongs would constitute an anticlimax rather than a feast of the sens-es. This is the type of album that\ngrows on you, though. It is also a\nhistoric Depeche album as it is the\nfirst one to contain songs written by\nvocalist Dave Gahan. The dictatorial\nMartin Gore (writer of all DM songs\nafter Vince Clarke\u2019s departure following the release of the first album,\nSpeak & Spell) has evidently softened down a bit and given up some\ncreative space for other people.\nThe music is not soft, though.\nThis is not a logical follow-up to\nthe extremely chilled-out, velvety\nExciter (2001), it is more that to\nGahan\u2019s moody solo LP Paper\nMonsters. The general atmosphere\ncreated by the songs in the listener\u2019s mind is definitely dark, almost\nanguished. It is a return to the classic Depeche sound of Music For\nThe Masses and Violator, where\nKraftwerk meets Sarah Bernhardt,\nwhere angels and demons fight\nfor eternity; austere but polished\nsounds full of drama and layered\ndepth.\nThis album is very in-your-face\ncompared to the emotional but sub-tle, even light-hearted at points,\nExciter. The music is very inor-ganic, Bauhaus-like at times, other\ntimes more like New Order. None of\nthe songs have much hit potential\n(but who cares about that), except\nmaybe the first single, Precious, a\nvery typical DM track, reminiscent\nof the eighties sound. The gem of\nthe album is Suffer Well, written by\nGahan. This is surprising as Gahan\nis still a relatively inexperienced\nsongwriter. Perhaps this is indicative of the trio\u2019s future sound, influenced progressively more by the\nsinger\u2019s aesthetic views. Also, it is\nclear Gahan has gained a lot of confidence in terms of his role in the\nband: he has never sung better. The\nsame cannot be said of Mr Gore: the\nworst songs in the album, Macro\nand Damaged People, are sung by\nhim, and he is whinier than ever.\nGore\u2019s lyric-writing has lost some\nof its freshness; his main obsessions (faith, sin, the fragility of love,\ndespair) are once again the recurrent themes of the album. However,\nhedealtwiththesethemesmuchbet-ter in Songs Of Faith And Devotion\nin 1993. The imagery is not very orig-inal: it\u2019s devils, and dark angels, and\npainfully sexy women (as described\nin Lilian, track number 11) once\nagain. Anton Corbijn, a visual artist\nwho has worked with the band (as\nresponsible for the videos and stage\ndesign) since the eighties, has done\na great job with the album sleeve\ndesign. The angel in the cover is\na hybrid between a chicken and\nRobert Smith. In summary, not a\nbad Depeche Mode album, especially considering that they have\nre-invented their sound once again.\nThe band has returned to the Dark\nSide, but through new paths.\nIrene Ladhe\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTake o\ufb00 your pants.. wait, this isn\u2019t page 3\nhose kraazy pop-punk nuthouses Blink-182 remind us why we laughed at them the \ufb01rst time\nBlink-182 - No longer funny.

This still equates to 4.7m\nviewers, which is pretty epic for\nBBC2, but soon my ranting will conquer Rome!\nNow, Shakespeare Retold \u2013\nMuch Ado About Nothing. Starring\nDamian Lewis, the one from Band\nof Brothers, and Billie Piper, the one\nwho liked tongue-twisters so much\nshe gave herself a new surname\ndedicated to them, Much Ado was\na modern retelling set on a tel-tv tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI felt a little daunted when the Felix\neditor handed me the Punk: Attitude\nDVD to review. My thoughts were: \u201cI\nhate punk music; he has given this\nto the wrong guy.\u201d\nPunk: Attitude is a documentary chronicling the origins of punk\nmusic, starting with bands such as\nThe Ramones and New York Dolls\nand finishing with present day artists\nsuch as Blink 182 and Limp Wristed,\nsorry, Limp Bizkit. Thankfully, an\nanarchy adoration and love of loud\nnoises is not a requirement to enjoy\nthis DVD. There are a multitude of\nmusic clips for fans to mosh along\nto, or whatever you crazy-cats do\nthese days but the documentary is\nmore concerned with the evolution\nof punk ideologies and what bands\nattempted to convey through their\nmusic.\nPunk music was conceived in the\nearly \u201870s but it wasn\u2019t born and\nnamed until Punk magazine was\ncreated in 1976. Music from bands\nsuch as New York Dolls was not\ndefined until the tabloids coined\nthe phrase \u201cpunk\u201d, borrowing from\nthis magazines title. There was a\npoint behind this clamorous, abrasive noise that soiled, afro or mullet wearing weirdoes blared out\nas they shouted down the micro-phone. Artists challenged politics\nand went against the system, or so\nthey argued. Listening to most past\nmasters being interviewed in Punk:\nAttitude, their intentions sounded\nentirely reasonable. However, one\ninterviewee comments that violence\nwas acceptable as long as their opinions were getting heard. How can\nthis be taken seriously? For me,\nthis totally undermines what punk\nmusicians were striving for. It is no\nevision news program. It followed\ntwo couples as their relationships\nwent from one extreme to the other.\nPiper played a ditsy weather girl\nand Lewis was an comical, arrogant\nnews presenter. I thought he might\nbe in no-man\u2019s land, but he was\nvery funny and suited the character well. As the episode progressed,\nit became more and more serious,\nending with Piper cracking her head\nopen. The doctors tried the best\nthey could, but unfortunately, there\nwas nothing they could do. Piper\nwas pronounced alive in order to\nsatisfy Shakespeare\u2019s original. Well\nworth watching the others in the\nseries, people.\nNext up, Jonathan Goodwin in The\nSeven Stupidest Things to Escape\nFrom. Goodwin came up with situations of increasing hilarity that he\nhad to escape from. One memorable example, that should have been\nissued mind rubbers, saw a naked\nGoodwin tied up in a lift. His family\nwaited at the bottom. He had eleven\nfloors to escape and get dressed.\nHe failed; and flailed! Blimey. Very\nfunny, but I\u2019ve got one for you baldy!\nHow about: I lock you up naked in a\nshed, set fire to it, seal your Peter in\na vice; tie you up except for one free\nhand and finally place a meat cleaver within reach! Ha! That\u2019s harsh...I\nliked Goodwin. He was nice, placid\nand I empathised when he broke his\nleg coming off a zip line. An absolute fruit-loop though. Mind you, his\nfather was pretty crazy too. Dad\ncalmly tied Goodwin up every time,\nrarely showing an emotion before\nunleashing a whole world of hurt on\nhis son.\nLastly, Lost. Not a great episode,\nto be honest. Basically, Ethan was\nlured into a trap. But, the plan went\nwrong after Charlie shot him. It was\ndramatic, but I felt annoyed. Yet\nanother chance to find out about\nthe mysterious island from Ethan\nand the creators decide to kill him\noff. It\u2019s suspenseful, but it\u2019s getting\npretty drawn out. 24, this is not.\nAnyway, get those caps on, hoods\nup, scarves wrapped. Till next time\nbrethren.\nTomo Roberts\nI\nt\u2019s all been going on since I got\nback from the bush. My little\nchook is courting some galah\nfrom over the road. That kid\u2019s\nnot so bad though. I made a\nblue by saying he had never done\nthe naughty with a gal before, then\nthe drongo goes and shows my Sky a\nlist of ex-girlfriends. He may not be\nthe full quid, but if my Sky likes him\nhe\u2019s alright by me.\nAnd how about that mongrel Paul\nRobinson. Some real monkey business going on with him and Izzie. I\nreally wish she would rack off and\ngive the old doc some space to get\nthings on with Susan. You should\nhave seen the sight on his dial when\nshe came up with the whole \u2018I was\nraped\u2019 thingo. Spewin\u2019 like I\u2019ve never\nseen.\nBloody Sheilas, eh! That Janelle\nTimmins is another one. Cunning\nas a dunny rat. Really stirred things\nup between me and Lynnie. She\nclaimed I pashed her at our Sky\u2019s\neighteenth. Of course I had a gutful\nof piss so I had to tell Lyn, but she\nstraightened things there and then.\nWith the blonde one over the\nroad gone troppo and Yellow-belly\nHazzer\u2019s new found wowser salvo\nattitude, I reckon everyone\u2019s trippin\u2019. But nah! Here\u2019ll do for me. Just\ngrab a tinny and veg out.\nHooroo till the next time!\nJoe Mangel\nLast weeks TV DVD Reviews\nwonder I view these people as ruf-fians, scallywags, rapscallions! It\u2019s a\nshame really. Many of the old band\nmembers appear to be very intel-ligent. Whilst their intentions were\nunderstandable, their methods of\nconveying their ideas were far too\nextreme.\nIronically, unlike these punk mis-creants, Punk: Attitude is very well\npresented. Packaged in a sleeve\nwith the glossy image of someone\n\u201cflipping a bird\u201d, it contains 2 DVDs\nwith plenty of extras and even replicas of two Sniffin\u2019 Glue fanzines.\nIt is definitely something that any\npunk fan should have on their shelf\nalongside their green hairspray,\nmetal studs and face chains. Punk:\nAttitude is difficult to recommend to\nanyone else other than middle-aged\nmen going through a mid-life crisis,\nlooking for inspiration on how to be\n\u201chip\u201d and \u201cdown with the kids\u201d.\nOverall, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the documentary.\nShockingly so, it pointed out that\neven I have some punk attitude in\nme, such as using computers to\nburn CDs against record companies\u2019 wishes. Yeah. Yeah! Fuck you\nsonny! Ahem, excuse me.

    "content": "Is this more of an Ang Lee film? In\nfact, is there such a thing as an Ang\nLee film?\nA: I don\u2019t think there is a typical\nAng Lee film. As long as I like the\nstory, I will make a film about it.\nFrom what I know, when James\nfirst showed me Annie Proulx\u2019s\nshort story in The New Yorker\nfour years ago, the story spoke\nto me and I had tears in my eyes\nafter reading it. It was a peculiar\nand realistic version of American\nlife, never-before-captured on\nfilm. The story was really refreshing and it was great material for\na film. I guess most of the films\nI\u2019ve made point to repression, the\nChinese society going through\nwesternization, family drama and\nhow there is nothing constant in\nlife except change.\nQ: What is more challenging in\nmaking the show? Was the terrain\nmore of an obstacle or was it more\ndifficult to capture the emotional\nbonds between the two leads?\nA: The terrain was the only real\ndifficulty in the show. It was easy\nto capture the emotions of the two\nleads because they were both very\ngood actors. Heath Ledger is a\nreally adaptable actor and I decided to cast him as the lead after I\nsaw him in Monster\u2019s Ball. I met\nhim in person and he really struck\nme as someone who could bring\nout the Western, brooding disposition much required in Brokeback\nI\nt starts off with quiet, serene\nshots of the green plains in\nWyoming. Two cowboys, Ennis\nDel Mar (Heath Ledger) and\nJack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal)\nmeet for the first time while they\nline up for a summer job with local\nrancher, Joe Aguirre. Ennis is quiet,\ncautious and reserved while Jack\nis emotional, loud and reckless. An\nimpossible match, they are stuck\nwith one another as they spend\nthe summer sheep-herding on\nBrokeback Mountain.\nHidden from the judgmental eyes\nof society on the quiet cloud-fringed\ntop of Brokeback Mountain, Ennis\nand Jack gradually gravitate from\ncamaraderie into deeper intimacy.\nWhen summer comes to an end,\nthe surreal connection they have\nshared is put on a standstill as they\nboth leave Brokeback Mountain to\nlead separate lives. Ennis remains\nin Wyoming and starts a family with Alma (Michelle Williams)\nwhile Jack bumps around Texas and\ncatches the eye of aggressive rodeo\nqueen Lureen Newsome (Anne\nHathaway).\nFour years later, a postcard arrives\nfor Ennis. Jack and Ennis meet up\nagain and in that one moment, it is\nclear that the passage of time has\nhad no effect on the mens\u2019 attach-ment. In the following years, Ennis\nand Jack struggle to keep their\nbond alive and a secret from their\nwives. Ennis becomes increasingly\nestranged from Alma and Lureen\nand Jack\u2019s wedding loses out to\nLureen\u2019s obsession with her father\u2019s\ncompany.\nWill they or won\u2019t they? Jack is\ntired of living a lie. He wants to start\nup a ranch with Ennis far away from\nthe narrow-minded perspectives of\nsociety. However, scarred from a\nchildhood memory, Ennis refuses\nto allow their connection to develop\ninto anything more than a series of\nannual camping trips.\nFrom a critique\u2019s perspective, the\nstarting is a little slow but once the\nstory picks up, you feel like you\nare caught in the spiralling of the\nemotions between the two leads.\nThe acting is superb and the narrative riveting. The background\nis extremely picturesque and the\nmovie relaxing. The shots are raw,\nemotional and the film is very richly\ntextured.\nIt is perhaps the only film I\u2019ve\nseen this year that comes close to\nbringing me to tears (and I never\ncry at movies).\nFelix was lucky enough to meet\nup with Ang Lee, the director of\nBrokeback Mountain and here is\nwhat he has to say about his shock-er-of-a-film:\nQ: This is a diverse breakaway\nfrom your last array of films such as\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\nhis winter: Brokeback Mountain\nFelix meets up with director Ang Lee to chat about his \ufb01lm this winter\nMountain.\nHeath Ledger is a really individual person and hence he carried the story and was the anchor\nbehind Brokeback Mountain.\nHeath and Jake both had to go to\nhorse-riding camp as Jake needed\nto learn how to ride horses and\nthey needed to learn to be at ease\nwith one another. During the film-ing, we had to repeat the scenes\nseveral times to make sure that\nwe nail each character. However,\nHeath broke Jake\u2019s nose as I told\nthem to kiss each other harder\nthan they would kiss a woman,\nto ensure that the film can be as\nauthentic as possible.\nQ: What made you decide to\ncast Anne Hathaway as Lureen\nJackson?\nA: It\u2019s quite funny because she\ncame in to do a reading while she\nwas filming Princess Diaries 2.\nShe apologised for all her ridiculous makeup and she just blew\nher princess image away by doing\nthe best reading I\u2019ve heard among\nall the others who came for the\naudtitions. Lureen Jackson was\na really important supporting\nfemale character in Brokeback\nMountain. As there is no internal narrative in the film, Lureen\nhad to provide the feedback on\nthe struggles the main characters\nwere going through.\nQ: What is it like being a director\nfrom Taiwan in the States?\nA: As a foreigner, I am more\nlikely to appreciate the subtext\nof the film. I am also able to look\nat a story with fresh eyes. In my\nopinion, American movies shout\nout at you while Chinese movies\nare more subtle and rely more\nBrokeback Mountain\nDirector: Ang Lee\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath\nLedger and Anne Hathaway.\nLength: 134 minutes\nCertificate: U\nReleased:30 December 2005\nHHHHI\non subtext. The films I make are\nless likely to be typical American\nmovies and they are more of how\nI see things in life. My dad never\nencouraged me to be a movie\ndirector, even after I got an Oscar.\nHowever, he was the one who told\nme to make a film, after a few\nyears of hiatus. Although I am\nsure he never meant that I should\nmake a film about gay cowboys. I\nfelt a certain peace in making this\nfilm. It was a healing experience\nfor me.\nAnd what does Felix have to say\nabout the film?\nIn a nutshell, you have to watch it.\nSome of you might be a bit deterred\nby the fact that it is set in cowboy-land (trust me, I don\u2019t like cowboys that much.), but its the story\nthat makes it great and the cowboy\nsetting created the much-needed\nobstacles for the two men. Some of\nyou (especially the straight men)\nmight also be put off the fact that\nit is a gay love story but I believe\ntrue love is a universal emotion that\ndefies all sexual preferences.\nLove it or hate it if you must but you\nmust watch it. There isn\u2019t another\nfilm this year that is as good at\ncapturing the eternal struggle of\nmisfortuned lovers as Brokeback\nMountain.\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nCan you survive a sham marriage?\n\u201cReality is sometimes\nmore forgiving than\nfilm\u201d\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDirector Ang Lee\n9\nfelix\nThursday 17 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n6\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 17 October 2005\nI\narrived at the Dana Centre\nfive minutes before 7pm at\nthe front end of the building to\nfind that I had no seat booked.\n\u201cNo problem, go through,\u201d the\nlady at the ticket desk said smiling,\nso I descended down some stairs\nto an area small enough to have an\ninvolved debate between all the people in the room, but large enough to\nbe comfortable. A bar behind me,\nselling drinks and snacks, promoted\nthe idea of a more social, engaging\nenvironment. People sat at round\ntables where they could meet other\npeople and presumably, by the end\nof the night, end up having enthusiastic discussions, maybe over some\nwine and some ammo from the actual panel of experts. The whole ambience of the room set off a funky, new-age type feel with modern d\u00e9cor.\nA large glass wall looking onto the\noutside of the building with bits of\nwriting on it loomed just behind the\npanel of speakers, and the interior\nwas painted a bright yellow to give it\na far from outdated aura.\nThe event, \u201cDrugs and the brain:\npills to make you normal\u201d, is part\nof a series exploring the future of\nbrain research, sponsored by the\nWellcome Trust. Any layperson can\ncome, and the discussions would\nundoubtedly attract not just people who are already interested or\ninvolved in the topics discussed, but\nalso students and people who want\nto get a first-hand opinion of someone who is an expert in the field.\nThe discussions got off to a rather\nsubduedstartasthefirstexpert,Clare\nStanford, a Psychopharmacologist\nfrom University of London was\nintroduced and began speaking\nabout her views on drugs and the\nbrain. She seemed to feel on the\nwhole quite positive about the future\nof drugs in solving mental health\nissues: if women can take \u201cthe pill\u201d\nall their lives, and be quite happy\nabout the various side effects it has,\nthen why not change your brain\nchemistry with drugs if they alleviate or help the symptoms of a mental illness? The next speaker, Peter\nKinderman, Clinical Psychologist at\nthe University of Liverpool, spoke\nlively about his belief that a more\nhands-on psychological approach\ninvolving working through possible\nsocial factors causing the issue may\nyield more lasting results in certain\nsituations where the diagnosis is not\ncompletely physical, for example,\ndepression. The third speaker, Peter\nTyrer, Psychiatrist from Imperial\nCollege London, seemed to be at a\nhalfway house between the two, and\nspoke with a calm, contemplative\nobservation of his opinions on the\nmatter.\nThe evening\u2019s audience was inter-esting. A nurse who works with\nthe NHS questioned the cost-effec-tiveness of cognitive behavioural\ntherapy, to which Peter Kinderman\nreplied that even if such therapies\nwere more time-consuming in the\nbeginning, compared to popping a\npill of Prozac, they could have long-er-lasting effects and take away the\ndependence on pills with all their\nnasty side effects. He suggested that\nperhaps it wouldn\u2019t be so expensive\nif there were more people trained\nto do it, and thatt perhaps this was\nan option for the government to\naddress.\nThere was also a bunch of shy\nmen who came as a group, apparently encouraged by their friend (or\nso he said) to come out and overcome their shyness with a combination of drugs and cognitive therapy\n(in other words, alcohol and the\nfascinating content of the discus-sion). Peter Tyrer commented on\nthe pharmaceutical industry\u2019s talent for picking up on what may\ncome in more extreme forms, for\nexample, severe cases of social\nanxiety disorder, and then turning\nit into a lucrative business opportunity where dozens of people who\njust happen to be quite shy can now\ngo out and buy \u2018medication\u2019 to cure\ntheir \u2018disorders\u2019.\nThe evening ended up involving\nsome good discussion: there were\ntwo people who confessed to suffering from depression and said that\nmedication had been a great help\nto them despite its side effects. It\nwas brought up by Peter Kinderman\nthat 50% of people apparently say\nthat the side effects are just as bad\nas the having the disorder itself.\nHowever, mixed opinion seemed to\nbe present about the use of drugs if\nthey could help induce a \u2018normal\u2019, or\nmore comfortable state.\nAt the beginning of the night,\nthe audience was asked to vote on\nwhether drugs are beneficial to the\nindividual suffering from a disorder,\nand also if they are beneficial to\nsociety. Originally, most people said\n\u2018agree a little bit\u2019 on both questions,\nwith a second majority going with\n\u2018agree\u2019, and a third with \u2018neither\nagree nor disagree\u2019. At the end of\nthe night, a second chance to vote\nvaried the statistics only slightly,\nwith the overall opinions being\nmaintained.\nAll in all, it was a well worthy\nnight. Anyone who wants a stimulating evening and loves a good\ndebate, or is interested in the\ntopic, or simply wants an \u2018alternative\u2019 night out with friends, should\ncheck out future events at the\nDana Centre. Places do need to be\nbooked, but if you can\u2019t get a space,\nthere\u2019s always the opportunity of\nwatching it live on their website,\nwww.danacentre.org.uk.\nPills to make you normal?\nNatalie Heng reviews the Dana Centre\u2019s debate on drugs and the brain.\nA\nrevolutionary\napproach to science\neducation is being\ntrialled in West\nMidlands schools,\nprompted by the upsurge of\ninterest in \u2018teaching the controversy\u2019 by some American education board officials.\nIn October 2004 a decision was\nmade by US education board\nofficials in the Dover district of\nPennsylvania to provide more\nbalance to curriculum coverage\nof the origins of life. Classroom\ntime formerly devoted to the theory of evolution would have to be\nshared with studies of Intelligent\nDesign \u2013 a rival explanation of\nthe origins of life, fast gaining\nproponents within the scientific\ncommunity. The move has since\ncreated waves within the more\nforward-thinking science departments on this side of the Pond.\n\u201cFrankly, we were wondering why we\u2019d never thought\nof it ourselves,\u201d says Gideon\nLightbody, Telford County\nCouncil Secondary Schools science coordinator. \u201cThey started\nby teaching the controversy over\nthe theory of Evolution, but why\ntake any of the so-called \u2018truths\u2019\nof science for granted, when\nwe can give our children more\nrounded educations. \u2018Teach The\nControversy\u2019 \u2013 TTC \u2013 it\u2019s our\nnew slogan.\u201d\nTo this end, the slogan has\nbeen assiduously applied to\nLitchfield\u2019s secondary schools\u2019\nscience curricula. Evolution was\nthe obvious starting point, but\ntheir new educational maxim\nhas been taken further by the\nlikes of Karen Roe, Deputy\nHead-Teacher at Fairfield\nComprehensive:\n\u201cWe now teach the controversy\nover the outdated sun-centred\nview of the solar system, and\nwe\u2019re currently revising the\nchemistry and first-aid curricula.\nAlchemy, for the first time in\nthree centuries, has finally made\na return to the classroom.\u201d\nMs Roe admits, however, that\nputting the new system into\npractice hasn\u2019t been plain sail-ing: \u201cThe lab sessions on capturing Phlogiston didn\u2019t go that\nwell, to be honest, and we had\ncomplaints from parents when a\nboy passed out after the school\nnurse used bloodletting to treat\nhis ADHD.\u201d\nIn spite of these difficulties,\nand the recent decision in Dover\ncounty to vote out many of\nthe Intelligent Design-friendly\nschool board members, Ms Roe\nis bullish. \u201cThe State of Kansas\nrecently decided to redefine\nscience as not limited exclusively to natural explanations.\nWe\u2019ve taken one step back and\ntwo steps forward.\u201d As Gideon\nLightbody puts it, \u201cIf we crack\nthose duff ideas about gravity,\nthere\u2019ll be no stopping us.\u201d\nDuncan Mcmillan\nhose\nwho con,\nteach?\n\u201cIf women can take \u2018the\npill\u2019 and be quite happy\nabout its side effect, why\nnot change your brain\nchemistry with drugs if\nthey alleviate illness?\u201d\nExpand your mind for\nFREE, right next to Imperial\nCollege\u2019s South Kensington\ncampus.\nControversial issues discussed in a thought-provok-ing, frank and entertaining\nway.\nEinstein\u2019s Greatest Theory\nTuesday 22 November,\n19.00-20.30\nEinstein made many scientific discoveries, but which\nwas his greatest?

The\nopponent\u2019s grounds were public\ngrounds with rather dodgy showers and changing rooms. Despite\nthis unwelcoming arrival, the ladies\nwalked out onto the pitch desperate to keep up their 100% record in\nULU.\nThe weather proved to be typically English and was awful. Rain,\nbacked up by wind, affected visibility throughout the match. After\nabout 25 minutes of hard play from\nboth sides the IC ladies stamped\ntheir superioriy on the match. Lizzie\nmade an amazing cross from the\nside line, which caused confusion in\nthe City defence, and an own goal\nwas scored by the opposition, confirming the advantage to the IC side.\nMany other goal opportunities were\nmissed as the opposition\u2019s keeper,\nthe biggest girl of their team, proved\nto be worthy of her position. With\nthis first goal however, although not\nentirely deserved, confidence was\ngained and a strong shot from within\nthe keeper\u2019s box was soon delivered\nby Chin, the team captain in person,\nwhich lobbed the City keeper and\nended up in a second goal.\nThe City ladies, however, did not\nsurrender this easily and gave the\ndefence some difficulty with their\ncounter attack. A certain number\n8, in particular, proved hard to con-trol, and despite Chlo\u00e9 (dame of the\ngame) and Jools\u2019 efforts at taming\nher, she managed to score the third\ngoal of the match, bringing the score\nto 2-1.

I was\nchallenged by a security guard and\nupon inspecting my card he told\nme I could not have it back as it\nwas now being recalled.

I have to\norganise a squad of 12 players and\nensure that people meet at correct\ntimes and get to the match as we\nhave to use public transport thanks\nto the lack of funding provided for\nsports at this university.

There\nare only two reasons why a card\nshould be withdrawn; 1. the card\ndoes not belong to the person carrying it, 2. the card is out of date.\nThe old style I/D cards are only\nreplaced on a needs only basis, i.e.\nif they are damaged or stop work-ing. Security Officers are instructed that they should only advise\nStaff / Students to get a replacement if they fall into this category,\nbut not to confiscate the pass. It\nwould appear that there has been\na breakdown in communications\nwith the security briefing for the\nimplementation of the new College\ndress code, I have addressed this\nand there should not be a recurrence of your unfortunate experi-ence.\nKind regards, Ceri.\nCeri Davies MSyI\nDear Editor,\nAppalled as I was by the College\u2019s\nannouncement of a new \u2018dress\ncode\u2019 and ID cards policy, I was\ndelighted to see on Monday that virtually all students and staff around\ncampus are doing exactly the right\nthing and ignoring the new rules\ncompletely. Rules like this can only\never be enforced if the majority\ngo along with them, as the college\nwill be rather embarrassed if it\nhas to bar all 10, 000 students and\nstaff from entering campus! Apart\nfrom introducing these rules without any consultation, Sir Richard\nhas ignored a few obvious flaws in\nthe scheme, such as the fact that\nImperial College blatantly isn\u2019t on\nal-Qaeda\u2019s Top Ten Infidel Targets\nlist, and no one can actually access\nany rooms in any department (or\nthe library) without having a college swipe card anyway. The most\nany \u2018intruder\u2019 might manage would\nbe to wander aimlessly around\nQueens Lawn - clearly a critical\nthreat to each and every one of us!\nAs long as both staff and students\nrefuse to cooperate with these\nrules, the college will find itself\nforced to think again. Sir Richard,\nyou\u2019re not at GlaxoSmithKline any\nmore - and we\u2019re not at school!\nChris Mark\n2nd year, Earth Science\nFaculities merger\nDear Felix,\nI was as shocked and angered that\nthe planed merger of the faculties of Life Sciences and Physical\nSciences was decided upon without\nany consultation of the students.\nHowever some good can come of\nit, why not let it be called the Royal\nCollege of Science once again.\nImperial is a university with very\nlittle sense of community, pride and\npassion. My department alone has\nhad three titles in my year and a\nbit here when I started last year it\nwas \u201cThe Department of Biological\nScience\u201d, then we became \u201cThe\nFaculty of Life Science\u201d and now\nwe will be \u201cThe Faculty of Natural\nScience\u201d.\nAs a life scientist I feel no sense\nof departmental loyalty. However\nI look upon the RSM with envy,\nthey all seem to be proud of their\ntradition. They treasure it and it\ngives them a great departmental\nfeel. Both RSM and C&G still exist\nand very proactive in events and\nactivities, however RCS is hardly\nmentioned. It seems to have been\nwiped from the face of Imperial. If\nthe RCS was re-formed then we too\ncould have this sense of community,\nwith a tradition to be proud of, to\nrival and surpass that of the RSM\nand C&G.\nWhy not let us go back to the RCS?\nWe can bring back the tradition\nand the sense of belonging that the\nold Imperial used to have. When\nImperial was founded it contained\nthe RSM, C&G and the RCS. There\nwas intense competition and\nrivalry between the three parts of\nImperial, be it on the sports field or\nin the pub!\nI feel that recreating the RCS and\nbringing back the traditions and\npractices that Imperial was founded\non will greatly improve our sense of\ncommunity and belonging. We can\nonce again be proud to not only be\npart of Imperial (probably the best\nuniversity in the world) but can also\nbe proud of our department \u201cThe\nRoyal College of Science\u201d.\nChris Stuart\n2nd Year Biochemistry Rep\n\n"

Later\nin life, one of these children develops Alzheimer\u2019s and slowly begins\nto forget who she is.\nIt has been said that \u2018the mind\nworks in mysterious ways\u2019. But how\nmuch of this mystery can be solved\nby looking at the genes that we\ninherit from our parents and how\nmuch by looking at the environment\nthat we were raised in?\nOn8NovemberattheDanaCentre,\nthree psychologists attempted to\nclarify to what extent the genes we\ninherit impact the development of\nour brains, our behaviour and our\nsusceptibility to disease, and to what\nextent the environment influences\nour development.\nBruceHood,aprofessorofdevelopmental psychology at the University\nof Bristol, researches social atten-Why are we who we are?\nAmber Bauer reports on Dana\u2019s latest nature versus nurture debate.\ntion in infants. According to him,\nboth genes and environment play\na large role in development. Genes\noperate within environments, he\nsaid. Neurons in the brain come relatively pre-configured in their function at birth, but they are designed\nto respond to stimuli in the baby\u2019s\nenvironment. It\u2019s almost as though\nnature has built in an expectancy to\nthese environmental stimuli, Hood\nsaid.\nMark Hanson, director of\nthe Centre for Developmental\nOrigins of Health and Disease at\nthe University of Southampton,\nresearches the influence of our past\non our health, behaviour and risk\nof disease. According to him, there\nare numerous \u2018pasts\u2019 to study. The\npath of human evolution illustrates\nour distant past, while our more\nrecent past relates to our neo-natal\nenvironment.\nAccording to Hanson, a mismatch\nbetween pre-natal and adult environmental conditions leads to greater risk of disease. Therefore, if the\nfoetus receives poor nutrition in the\nwomb and grows up to eat a very\nhigh-calorie diet, for example, then\nthe person has a much greater risk\nof becoming obese, having heart dis-ease, etc.\nIn a paper published in Science in\nSeptember 2004, Hanson contended\nthat mothers send messages to their\ngrowing child that allow the baby to\npredict the environment it is likely\nto live in after birth. The foetus\nthen adapts its physiological development to ensure it has the best\nchance of survival in that expected\nfuture environment. For example,\nif a mother is extremely stressed\nduring pregnancy, she conveys the\nmessage that it\u2019s a dangerous world\nto her unborn child, influencing the\nchild\u2019s stress responses later in life.\nSir Michael Rutter, a professor of\ndevelopmental psychopathology at\nKing\u2019s College London, is doing a\nlong-term study on children adopted from Romania by UK families.\nThese children were brought up in\ndeprived conditions in the institutional system in Romania and were\nadopted by \u201cslightly better than\naverage\u201d British families, he said.\nRutter\u2019s research is looking into\nhow these deprived conditions after\nbirth affect these children\u2019s develop-ment. The most significant finding\nis that children who were in these\ndeprived conditions for less than\nsix months showed no more impairments than children in the general\npopulation. These impairments\nincluded autistic-like patterns, intellectual impairments, inattention\nand hyperactivity. After living for\nsix months in these conditions, how-ever, children exhibited higher than\nnormal levels of multiple impair-ments.\nThese findings show that it takes\na bit for these conditions to register,\nRutter said. But once they do, their\neffects are significant and hard to\nreverse.\nOverall, the psychologists agreed\nthat both nature and nurture play\na large role in the development of\nthe brain. So it seems that in most\ncases we are who we are because\nof our parents, no matter which way\nwe look at it.\nThe next Dana Centre program is\n\u201cEinstein\u2019s greatest theory\u201d on\n22 November at 7pm.\nOn 19 December 1999, under clear\nand starry skies at the Kennedy\nSpace Centre, the space shuttle\nDiscovery lifted off at 18:50 CST,\nlighting up the central Florida\ncoastline, to send Commander\nCurt Brown, Pilot Scott Kelly, and\n5 mission specialists on a two-day\nchase to catch and retrieve the\n12-tonne Hubble Telescope. At the\ntime of launch Hubble was sailing over Eastern Africa and had\nbeen in hibernation since the loss\nof a gyroscope in November that\nyear. Hubble\u2019s need for precise\norientation to carry out its scientific work requires at least three\nout of the six on-board gyroscopes\nto be in order. After the failure in\nNovember that year it only had\ntwo and, although safely sleeping\nin orbit, was inoperative.\nTwo days later, when Discovery\nreached a point about half a\nmile away and directly beneath\nthe telescope, Scott Kelly and\nCommander Brown took manual\ncontrol of the Shuttle to gently\nmanoeuvre the 110-tonne orbiter\nto within feet of Hubble and capture it with a robotic arm. Once\nthe telescope had been secured in\nthe payload bay, the crew released\nthe arm and used it to perform\na television survey of Hubble\u2019s\nexterior. After three servicing\nspacewalks the telescope\u2019s redeployment took place at an altitude\nof 370 statute miles. As the two\nspacecraft flew over the South\nPacific\u2019s Coral Sea, Hubble\u2019s aperture door opened to the heavens\nonce more. That night the crew\nwent to bed just before midnight\nshuttle time and woke to a day\nof preparations for landing. After\nseven days in space Discovery\nwas in a 363 by 380 statute mile\norbit with all systems on board\nperforming well.\nSix years later we have the\npleasure of welcoming Scott Kelly\nto Imperial to give a talk about his\nexperience in space and the future\nof NASA\u2019s space programme. He\nwill also try to persuade us that\nwe have made the right decision\nby choosing to study science,\nand that society needs scientists\nand engineers like us. Astronaut\nKelly is assigned to be the commander of the STS-118 mission to\nthe International Space Station to\ninstall solar power arrays when\nthe Shuttle fleet returns to flight in\nthe near future.\nThe event is organised with the\nhelp of the International Space\nSchool Educational Trust (www.\nisset.org), who are Scott\u2019s hosts\nin the UK, the Imperial College\nAstronomy Society and Imperial\u2019s\nOutreach Office.\nIvan Minev\nIC Astronomy Society President\nThe lecture will take place on\nMonday 21 November in the\nSir Alexander Fleming building,\nLecture Theatre 1 at 5pm.\nEveryone is welcome.\nNASA astronaut at Imperial\nNews in\nBrief\nLink lost with asteroid robot\nJapan\u2019s space agency has lost\ncontact with a robotic probe\nthat it dispatched to explore\nthe surface of an asteroid,\naccording to reports.

Some scrolls\ndepict battle or hunting scenes\nwhich show a multitude of tiny sol-diers- trekking through hilly land-scape, sailing down treacherous riv-ers, or wrestling tigers, whilst others\nlike the \u2018Emperor\u2019s 60th birthday\ncelebration\u2019 have a more relaxed\nattitude. There is even a series of\nscrolls which shows, as the audio\nguide put so nicely, \u2018rather seductive idealised women partaking in\nleisure activities!\u2019\nIf searching for criticism, the only\nfault I could pick is that perhaps the\nexhibition was too long, however\nover all it was really interesting and\nunique. Also, as many of the exhibits\nhave never left China before, this is\na unique opportunity to see artefacts\nthat are rarely available to the pub-lic.

The dynasty was the last\nto rule China, and existed between\n1644 and 1911.\nThe Chinese believed the emperor\nto be the only direct link between\nheaven and earth, and their prosperity was celebrated in the art of\nthe period. You can gauge the importance and power of these emperors\njust by passing by the 5m portraits\nand the huge ornate robes of gold\nand dark blue. These arestartling-ly intricate textiles and definitely\nlarge enough to swamp any Chinese\nemperor!\nThis exhibition is astonishingly\ndiverse, having everything from\n10m long scrolls (some merely sections taken from 60m originals) to\nolive shaped snuffboxes the size of\na fingernail. There are traditional\nportraits and calligraphy as well as\nstrange ritualistic objects, for example from the strong Chinese belief in\ncosmology worshipping of the time.\nThe exhibition has costumes and\nobjects for moon worship including \u2018moon white\u2019 glazed vessels of\ncurious symmetrical shapes each\nbelieved to be part of the sacred\nmoon and an engulfing \u2018moon white\u2019\nrobe for the emperor to wear during\nthe ceremony.\nThese foreign rulers from Manchu\nsupported the Buddhist ideals of\nTibetans and Mongolians as well\nas expressing an interest in science and European culture. These\ninfluences can be seen through\nthe hybrid style of painting which\ndepicts European influence on traditional Chinese styles, the European\nstyle of perspective and highlighting\ncontrasting with the Chinese style\nof flat planes and ornate surface\npatterns.\nMany of the pieces in the exhibition also feature some interesting\nsymbols that we still see around us\ntoday, like the five clawed red dragon reflecting prosperity and protec-tion, or the white rabbit which is\nsupposed to be lucky.\nBut there are also a few more\nobscure images, like the fungus representing immortality-the Chinese\ndo seem obsessed with their fungus!\nSome of you might think that fungus\nwould be more in its place in the\nmud outside, but the Chinese kept\nhuge screens with fungus made\nout of wood, and had ornate fun-12\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 17 November 2005\nThe Nine Elders of Huichang, 1787, Nephrite (green jade) boulder,\n114.5 x 90 cm, The Palace Museum, Beijing\nThe Royal Opera House is quite\npossibly the last stronghold of\nupper class snobbery left in the\npublic entertainment world today.\nHowever, the new Travelex \u00a310\nStudent Standby scheme is set to\nchange all that. The scheme works\nby texting or emailing students with\ndetails of available seats which can\nthen be booked online for just \u00a310.\nSo, to celebrate this new and\nwonderful student offer, Felix went\nalong to review the Royal Opera\u2019s\ncurrent production of Tippett\u2019s The\nMidsummer Marriage.\nThe Midsummer Marriage is a\nstory of the spiritual development of\ntwo couples, Jenifer and Mark, and\nBella and Jack. Set on a pagan backdrop of ritual and seasonal celebra-tion, the opera is full of undertones\nof mythology and religion combining\nto bring about Jenifer and Mark\u2019s\nspiritual reawakening, and the inevitable demise of Jenifer\u2019s capitalistic\nOpera\nThe Midsummer Marriage\nRoyal Opera House\nCovent Garden\nTicket \u00a34-\u00a385/\u00a310 Student Standby\nUntil 18 November 2005\nROH opens its doors to students Love hurts: Cleansed\nCleansed is a very unsatisfying\nplay. With its major themes of humiliation and physical agony, seeing\nCleansed is a torturous experience\nthat I would recommend to few.\nThe play is composed of 20\nextreme scenes, each either an episode of violence or some full-frontal\nnudity. The language is minimal,\nspoken as weighty poetry by a talented bunch of actors who supplement it with stylistic and demanding\nphysical theatre. One memorable\nscene, illustrating the artistic indulgence of Cleansed, was 10 minutes\nof watching a man with a learning\ndisability, in great sobbing distress,\nbeing forced to eat a whole box of\nchocolates, one by one.\nKane, who committed suicide in\n1999, was influenced by proponents\nof the genre known as Theatre of\nCruelty.

But Kane failed to shock\nme, because her play completely\nlacks relevance to the real world.\nIn different scenes the characters\nappear to be in different places \u2013 for\nexample a lunatic asylum, a private mental hell, a strip club, on a\ntrain-track; but the production style\nrenders these environments hopelessly vague. The play has an air of\nflighty disregard towards concrete\npracticalities, but what it fails to take\ninto account is that shock resides\non a background of specifics: familiar situations being perverted in a\nunthinkable manner, normal people\nbeing driven to terrible things.\nEmma Rose Mcglone\nThe Midsummer Marriage, \u00a9 Bill Cooper october 2005\nfather King Fisher.\nThe impressively bizarre set represents a magical glade in a wood,\nlaid out like a games board and\nenclosed by a wall.

Flawlessly\nperformed, this is not one for newcomers to the genre, but this is an\nuntraditional piece that pushes perceptions of what opera should be.\nEL\n\n"

Did you know\nthat they have won at Henley Royal\nRegatta two dozen times, the last\ntime being the coxed four in 2004.\nWhy is this important? Well, Henley\nis a very prestigious regatta which\neach year attracts entries from as\nfar afield as the USA and Australia\nalong with the likes Oxford,\nCambridge and member of the GB\nnational squad. Need I say more?\nHowever, that\u2019s just the start of our\nsuccess. You may remember the\nSydney Olympics in 2000, when the\nBritish eight won gold for the first\ntime in almost 90 years. Well 3 of\nthat crew, along with the coach who\ntrained them, were from Imperial!\nSo as you can see we aren\u2019t doing\ntoo badly. But how do we do it?

The national euphoria we all enjoyed when the English\nfootball team qualified for Germany\n2006 has resulted in punters betting\nover \u00a3500 million on England lifting\nthe trophy, roughly a \u00a310 stake for\nevery man, woman and child in the\ncountry. The stage is set. What could\nbe better than being crowned world\nchampions on the home turf of those\nbloody Germans roughly 40 years\nafter the last triumph in 1966? Not\nvery many things I\u2019m sure. That is\nwhy investing at such paltry odds is\nill-advised.\nAll these economic patriots surely\ndeserve better odds than the 7/1\navailable? This brings me to my\npoint. Betting on England to win\nrepresents poor value as the bookmakers odds are mainly influenced\nby the fact that bookmakers know\nthat patriotic fans will part with\ntheir cash no matter what. This is\nto offset their potential for heavy\nlosses. Before you accuse me of\nbeing another whinging-faced Jock\ntalking down your chances, I\u2019d like\nyou to know that I want England\nto succeed. I just wouldn\u2019t put my\nmoney on it.\nBetting should be a dispassionate\ntransaction, uninfluenced by personal loyalty. This is why you won\u2019t\nfind me backing my teams, Scotland\nand Rangers, with my own cash.\nI\u2019d always be looking through blue\ntinted glasses, ripe for exploitation\nby bookmakers.

They don\u2019t talk for long\nthough, or at least I can\u2019t hear them\nany more, as my eardrums are\nbeing assaulted by the sprawling climax to the previously sombre song.\nWhile before they stood still, they\nnow throw themselves across the\nstage lifting their guitars high above\ntheir heads then bringing them\ncrashing back down with the beat.\nIt is impossible not to admire the\nconfidence of these guys, not only\nfor creating such passionate music\nwithout words to accompany it, but\nfor taking the time in between the\n\u201cloud bits\u201d to fully explore the more\nreflective elements to their songs.\nOn leaving the stage to what would\nhave been a standing ovation if we\nweren\u2019t already standing the band\nare visibly overwhelmed at the level\nof enthusiasm shown by their fans,\nwho are then equally disappointed\nat the lack of an encore.\nAnother \u00a34 pint and its now that\nit becomes clear to me why EITS\ncouldn\u2019t just have carried on all\nnight; tonight is Kieran Hebden\u2019s\nnight as the only member of his\nexperimental electronica project,\nFour Tet. It\u2019s a shame then that\nabout a third of the audience for\nEITS have already left by then,\neither thinking that was the end of\nthe show, or having a snobbish dislike for all things electronic, as they\nare really missing out. He arrives\nonstage to a warm applause bash-fully, and seems almost unsure of\nwhat to do to begin with. The audi-ence, myself included, are initially\nunimpressed by the almost unlis-tenable cut-ups and samples that\nhe gives us, but he soon reaches\nhis stride and leaps into a golden\noldie, Hands from the always brilliant album Rounds. He then seam-lessly mixes this into another playful\npiece from the same album, and\nthe Palais remembers, as one, why\nwe all loved Four Tet so much in\nthe first place. Gone are the more\nlaid-back tracks tonight, as Kieran\nseems determined to get the crowd\nmoving and puts out some dancier\nmixes of his best works which the\nbeered-up punters lap up appreciat-ingly. Half an hour of samples looped\nover each other and pasted onto\ntribal rhythms later, and the man\nknown as Four Tet re-emerges from\nthe depths of backstage after a triumphant set to appease our needs\nfor more with a select few extras in\nan all-too-brief encore. Something\na little different then, which can\nsurely only be a good thing.\nToby Prudden\nThe Brakes are an amalgamation of\nBritish Sea Power and The Electric\nSoft Parade (and the Tenderfoot);\nsupposedly a cutting edge musical\nexperiment, but frankly, probably\njust a vehicle for inert \u2018Dull Parade\u2019\nmembers to get laid riding precariously on the crest of BSP\u2019s wave.\nHowever, The Brakes may (and\nprobably should) excite you to your\nvery core; unless of course you are\npresently touching yourself while\npondering those cherubic scamps,\nThe Arctic Monkeys.\nFirstly, a word about the venue:\nthe Borderline is a place to detest\nand despise. Unless your name\nis Tarquin, you enjoy the work of\ndead peasant and own a gold plated\ntop-hat, drinks are unaffordable.\nFurthermore, there is, for no apparent reason, a huge obelisk-like structure in the middle of the venue; so,\nwhile at the bar desperately trying\nto exchange an innocent companion for a pint of stale Fosters, you\ncan see nothing other than a mass\nof bobbing gold plated top-hats. A\ntruly sickening, wretched hovel of\na venue.\nTo The Brakes then. I refuse to\nmention either of the support bands,\nas the very thought of them makes\nme want to lick the tongue of a bird\nflu ridden turkey. Twice. The Brakes\nstarted with aplomb, playing almost\nthe entirety of Public Enemy\u2019s Fear\nOf A Black Planet while setting up.\nThis was fabulous as I too enjoy\nfighting the power; and, have a\ncocker spaniel called Chuck D who\nrecently took a slug in Compton. It\nmade me nostalgic for times past.\nTears were shed. So thank you, The\nBrakes!\nMusically, they are astounding.\nTightlikeaninnocentmanduringhis\nfirst shower in prison. It all seems to\nbe based around the guitarist, who,\ninexplicably is from Electric Soft\nParade. It is his crushing guitar riffs\n- somehow played while flailing and\nhopping around like a leper - which\ngive the songs depth and draw you\nin. The singer (Eamon from BSP)\nseems to have attempted to lift the\nbest parts from the voices of both\nNeil Young and Frank Black: obviously he\u2019s not a patch on either, but\none must respect his courage to\nattempt to wail and screech melodi-cally. From the pulsing, sing-along\nsingle All Night Disco Party, they\nlaunch straight into one of their\n8 second thudding rants, Cheney.\nThese miniscule songs show off the\nband\u2019s musical talent proudly, they\nalso offer a stark, bracing jolt, arresting the attention of any apathetic\ncrowd members. However, the band\ntended to repeat these songs and\nothers which are essentially identi-cal, and, after the fourth or fifth\ntime, they stop being a novelty and\nbecome an irritation, to all other\nthan the amorphous scenesters littering the venue and whooping and\nhollering throughout. The Brakes\nwork though, they write inventive\nsongs and, judging by the effort\nthey\u2019ve put in making their set air-tight, they genuinely seem to enjoy\nplaying them. Even to Londoners.\nThe Brakes are a breathe of fresh\nair in a scene wholly starved of talent\nand inventiveness. Unfortunately\nfor them and us, they will always be\nplaying in places like the Borderline\nbecause the lead singer is bald and\nthe rest of them don\u2019t look like movie\nstars or drug fiends. It\u2019s a shame\nthat success is no longer based on\nthe attributes it should be: talent\nno longer counts. Any old tune, a\ndangling cigarette and high cheekbones are all that\u2019s necessary.

    "content": "Joseph Weber, at the University of\nMaryland. He developed a detector\nessentially consisting of a large aluminium bar suspended in a vacuum,\nwhich a gravitational wave would\ncause to oscillate almost impercep-tibly. The method was crude, and the\nsensitivity was a few notches below\nthe target. Although Weber did publish results claiming detections,\nthey were never confirmed later\non by more sensitive instruments.\nNevertheless, his work opened up\nthe whole new possibility of listening\nto the sky. \u201cThe analogy works rather well. Our ears are able to capture\nsounds coming from all directions\nwithout having to turn our heads,\nand so does a gravitational wave\ndetector\u201d, says Danzmann.\nToday, state-of-the-art detectors\nuse high precision lasers to monitor minute shifts in the distance\nbetween two weights located perpendicular to each other and free\nto move horizontally. An incoming\ngravitational wave will cause them\nto move a subatomic distance with\nrespect to one another. They are\nkept in rooms whose atmosphere is\ncleaner than in hospital surgeries\nand inside the world\u2019s largest vacuum systems to ensure that stray\ngas molecules will not affect the\nmeasurements.\nThe USA spent $365m over the\nlast six years building two kilome-tre-sized detectors in Louisiana and\nWashington called LIGO (Laser\nInterferometery Gravitational Wave\nObservatory). They have been looking for gravitational waves since\n1999 and will soon be joined by two\nother detectors in Europe: GEO600\n(Germany) and VIRGO (Italy).\nRecently, a flurry of activity was\nreported in the Louisiana LIGO\ndetector, but the hurricane Katrina\nis not exactly a gravitational wave.\nTwo events within a short period of\ntime on different facilities either in\nthe USA or Europe will be required\nto confirm a clear detection because\nof spurious local effects that can\naffect the detectors such as tornadoes or earthquakes.\nOnce these waves are detected\nastronomers hope to be listening\nto a part of the universe they know\nvery little about. \u201cThe part of the\nuniverse that is radiating gravitational waves is complementary to\nthe one that is emitting light. All we\nknow about the universe we know\nfrom light, electromagnetic waves,\nwhere matter is diluted and moving slowly. Gravitational waves are\nemitted in regions where matter\nis extremely dense and moving at\nnear-light speeds, and that\u2019s a part\nof the universe that is not emitting\nlight,\u201d says Danzmann.\nThe confirmation of one of\nEinstein\u2019s predictions may well lead\nto the discovery of another. Black\nholes haven\u2019t been detected yet\nbecause they emit no light; how-ever, they can be rather boisterous emitters of gravitational waves.\nAlso, gravitational waves have the\nadvantage of not being absorbed like\nelectromagnetic radiation. That will\nallow astronomers to look further\ninto the past, beyond an era when\nthe universe was so dense that no\nlight from back then ever reached\nus. \u201cWith gravitational waves the\nuniverse is completely transparent,\nso in principle we will be able to look\nstraight into the Big Bang\u201d, says\nDanzmann.\nAnd of course, there\u2019s the stuff\nwe don\u2019t know about. \u201cWe will really\nonly know about sources of gravitational waves from gravitational\nwaves, so who knows?\u201d\nThe optimism is such that scientists have already set their eyes, or\nbetter ears, on the future. The US\nPresidential budget to congress for\n2008 has already commissioned an\nupdate of the LIGO facilities for 15\ntimes more sensitivity \u2013 a fit that not\neven the Hubble telescope achieved\n\u2013 in a project called Advanced LIGO.\nAnd then in 2013 the gravitational\nwave detectors will be taken off to\nspace on a mission called LISA.\nLISA\u2019s sensitivity will be so large\nthat the problem then will be discerning gravitational wave sources\nfrom each other.\nBy then, no matter what the out-come, there will be a detection. \u201cBy\nthe time we reach Advanced LIGO, if\nwe don\u2019t detect anything, then we\u2019ll\nstart wondering whether there\u2019s\nsomething wrong with our ideas.\nAnd if LISA doesn\u2019t detect gravitational waves, that\u2019s a detection in\nitself. It will clearly mean there\u2019s\nsomething wrong with our models of\nthe universe,\u201d says Danzmann.\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAstronomers to start\nlistening to the universe\nJo\u00e3o Medeiros reports on advances in the quest for gravitational waves.\nscience\n4\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 17 October 2005\nA\nlthough they work in the\nnight hours, astronomers crave for a little\nlight from distant stars\nto learn about the uni-verse. That dependency is coming\nto an end. \u201cFor centuries we have\nbeen building better telescopes to\nlook at the sky, but it\u2019s time we\nlisten to it as well,\u201d says Karsten\nDanzmann, director of the Max\nPlanck Institute for Gravitational\nPhysics in Hannover. He believes\nthe discovery of a new form of radiation \u2013 gravitational waves \u2013 is immi-nent.\nGravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein\u2019s 90-year-old theory\nof gravity. Unlike electromagnetic\nwaves, which travel through the\nmedium of space-time, gravitational\nwaves are a distortion of spacetime itself, a possibility that even\nEinstein didn\u2019t believe.\nAstronomers are more trustful\nof Einstein\u2019s equations these days.\n\u201cAlthough there is still no direct\nevidence, no one really doubts that\ngravitational waves exist,\u201d says\nDanzmann. The first indirect evidence for gravitational waves came\nin 1973 from two astronomers in\nPrinceton, Russell Hulse and\nJoseph Taylor. They made observations of a pair of neutron stars\nrevolving around each other in\nshort and fast orbits and were able\nto confirm that they were losing\nenergy at exactly the same rate as\npredicted from gravitational waves.\nThe significance of their discovery\nwas awarded with a Nobel prize 20\nyears later.\nHowever, direct evidence will\nrequire more than just telescopes.\n\u201cIf you look at a massive star exploding somewhere in our vicinity, not\ntoo far away but also not too close,\nthe resulting gravitational waves\nwill squeeze space by one part in\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. This\nmeans that our detector of 1 km\nwould be squeezed by 1/1000 of the\nproton diameter. And that unfortunately only takes a few milliseconds.\nSo you really have to listen rather\nclosely,\u201d says Danzmann.\nThe stringent requirement for\nsensitivity explains why scientists\nare only just now getting optimistic\nabout the possibility of detecting\nthis novel type of radiation. The\nenterprise started in the sixties with\n\u201c\u2018For centuries we have\nbeen building better\ntelescopes to look at\nthe sky, but it\u2019s time we\nlisten to it as well,\u2019 says\nKarsten Danzmann.\u201d\n\u201cRecently, a flurry of\nactivity was reported in\nthe Louisiana detector,\nbut the hurricane\nKatrina is not exactly a\ngravitational wave.\u201d\nImperial\nNews\nNew TB test scoops top\nprize at Medical Futures\ncompetition\nThe launch of the European\nAn inexpensive and rapid test\nfor tuberculosis (TB) which\ncould be used in developing\ncountries has won first place in\nthe Best Innovation to Improve\nGlobal Healthcare category of\nthe Medical Futures Innovation\nAwards. It also scooped the\noverall prize at the awards\nceremony held last week in\nLondon.\nDr David Moore, from\nImperial College London, and\nthe winner of the Award said:\n\u201cThis test can be carried out\nusing cheap and readily available tools and requires relatively\nlittle training or expertise.\nThis is particularly important\nin developing countries which\nmay not have the infrastructure we take for granted in the\ndeveloped world.\u201d\nImperial academics win\nLeverhulme prizes\nDr Molly Stevens, a Reader in\nthe Department of Materials,\nand Dr Sebastian Uchitel, a\nLecturer in the Department\nof Computing, have each been\nawarded Philip Leverhulme\nprizes worth \u00a350,000.\nDr Stevens\u2019s team has been\nable to engineer large quantities of bone, using a novel\napproach which uses the\nbody as a \u201cbioreactor\u201d.

Story, char-acterisation, readability, quality of\nwriting, pace \u2013 everything. I can\ncome up with no criticism of this\nincredible story; it is one of the\nmost enjoyable reads I\u2019ve ever come\nacross and probably the most original story by far \u2013 this NEEDS to be\nread.\nPhilip Pullman\u2019s fantasy trilogy\nexploded onto the scene to a monumental reception several years\nago. After a seemingly endless list\nof rave reviews from every major\nreviewer and publication around at\nthe time, it scooped up a huge string\nof awards as well, and gained Mr\nPullman tremendous international\nacclaim. It has successfully endured\nits fair share of controversy as well\n\u2013 with a story that takes a blatant\nstab at Catholicism and several of\nits teachings. I should stress that\nPhilip Pullman\u2019s message is not one\nof hatred towards the Church or\nof atheism but one that most people accept without giving voice to\n\u2013 that a person can live a good life\nwithout an institution \u2018guiding\u2019 their\nsteps and dictating what is right and\nwrong.\nMr Pullman\u2019s story is a remarkable achievement \u2013 it manages to\ncondemn the Church as an institution created to control people\u2019s lives,\nwhile still telling a powerful story\nthat is undeniably tragic and memo-rable. The story revolves around\nLyra and Will, two adolescents from\nparallel worlds similar to each other\nthat get caught up in a war of biblical proportions. Without revealing\ntoo much, it is impossible to truly\ngive an idea of just how deep and\ncomplex this story is, not least how\nwide-ranging its subject matter \u2013\nfrom the nature of angels and God,\nthe oppressiveness of the Church to\nquantum physics. As if such ancient\nconundrums were not difficult\nenough to juggle, the author also\nmanages to delve into the meaning and nature of love, friendship\nand sacrifice, tingeing his story with\nhumour, wit and bitter irony.\nThis creation epitomises what\ngood storytelling is all about \u2013 the\nright pace, tension, multidimensional characters and the perfect\nending. Include a narrative that is\nvery readable and incredibly com-pulsive, and you have the perfect\nnovel. The author has the rare ability to make the reader keep turning\npages, as well as a real gift for prose\n\u2013 neither patronising in its simplicity nor daunting in its complexity.\nAs to the characters, the author\nhas made a very difficult, but very\ncommendable move to make them\nall anything but clich\u00e9 \u2013 there is no\n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 character, every one\nof them does what seems right in\nthe situation they are confronted\nwith. This level of realism seen in\neach character only adds more to\nthe reader\u2019s fondness of the protagonists \u2013 making the tragic ending\nall the more powerful.\nOne aspect of this piece of writing that merits comment is the fact\nthat this is a Fantasy book \u2013 set in a\nuniverse with different possibilities\nand clearly one sprung from the\nauthor\u2019s amazing imagination.

    "content": "At the beginning of November was Riseweek, an anti-racism and anti-islamophobia campaign. The Union organised events from debates to world cup football to\ncelebrate diversity in Imperial with the support of the OSC, RAG, Debating, Model United Nations, Islamic and the Afro-Caribbean Societies. Thanks to all of you\nwho contributed.\nComing up at the end of November is S.H.A.G week, a week to raise awareness for Sexual Health and Guidance leading to World AIDS Day on December 1st. Look\nout for the red ribbons, for getting S.H.A.G. approved and for the very many events organised for this massive week.\nTake a look at the union today, and what is the most important element you will find?\nThe answer is Clubs and Societies, and it\u2019s not just me who thinks so. The Union Strategic Review from last year records that 96% of you believe that \u2018The Unions Clubs and\nSocieties are an essential part of student life.\u2019\nGiven then its worth, we should firstly congratulate ourselves that we have 260 odd\nactive clubs, and the structures in place to support them. After all we have a deputy\npresident whose sole responsibility is to manage clubs and societies.\nSecondly, it is worth taking a look at how we do manage our student activities, and consider whether there is any room for improvement.\nThis may bring groans from some of you, but the aim of the exercise is not to spend\nmonths throwing around buzz words only to come out at the end with a structure. (And\none which might bear a striking resemblance to the one we have now). Yes, we\u2019ve all\nseen these things go wrong before.\nInstead the idea is to step back and think about why we do the things we do with clubs\nand societies, and try and turn a history of generally successful precedents into a concrete policy that we can move forward with, as well as to identify, and adjust, things that\nrun contrary to the aims and objectives of the Union as a whole.\nTo this end, a working group has been set up consisting of members of the Student Activities Committee (SAC), the body in charge of overseeing student activities. This group\nis in fact directly accountable to you, the club member, as SAC is made up of the chairs\nof clubs and society committees (CSC), as well as the Faculty Union presidents, and the\nRAG and CAG chairs.\nThe point of this is that everyone can have a say in this review, we will shortly be having\nan official consultation with all union members. However, of course, the best way to get\nyour voice heard, as always, is to talk to your nearest union representative (be it club\nchair, CSC chair or Sabb).\nAs for official consultation, we expect to distribute questionnaires, hold focus groups,\nand conduct interviews with some members of college staff and union officers, aiming\nto get as big a range of opinion as possible. The aim is simply to get as many opinions as\npossible. Thus we will know what you want student activities to be. So far nothing has\nbeen ruled out, and nothing ruled in, so there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to make a differ-ence.\nLook out for more details on specific ways to get involved in the next few weeks, notices\nwill be posted in Felix and on the monitors in the JCR, as well as on notice boards. Until\nthen, if you have any suggestions, please either contact your nearest union representative or email suggestions to dpcs@imperial.ac.uk. We look forward to hearing your\nopinions.\nClubs & Societies Review\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB. T: 020 7594 8060 www.union.imperial.ac.uk\nJamesYearsley - Media Group Chair\nUnion News...\nSameena Misbahuddin - President\nUnion Newsletter & Email\nIn last week\u2019s issue of Felix you will have found the first Union newsletter. It\u2019s designed\nto give you more information about the Union; what\u2019s going on in the Union, what the\nUnion is doing for you and how you can get involved. The idea is in response to the large\namounts of feedback we received last year about the Union and the need to improve its\ncommunications.\nThis is something I feel passionately about, so I hope this will be a few steps to improving the situation. The newsletter will come out every 2 weeks (but a different size so that\nit doesn\u2019t fall out!) and along with the Union Website, which is being revamped this year,\nand the all new redesigned Union Email, going out this week, I hope that it will allow\nthose who wish to you know more about the Union, the opportunities to do so.\nSmoking & the Union Building\nWith smoking seeming to be in the news a lot lately, I thought it would be good to give\nan explanation of the provisions in the Union. There have often been requests for a\nnon-smoking venue to be provided amongst the Union bars. In response, last term saw\na 3 month no-smoking trial in DaVincis (the middle of the 3 bars). A lot of feedback was\nreceived and the outcome was very mixed \u2013 a lot of people were in favour of the ban,\nbut this being balanced by the many people against it. In response a compromise was\nfound \u2013 DaVinci\u2019s \u201c9am-9pm\u201d non-smoking during the week, but with smoking allowed\nafter 9pm during the week and all day during the weekend and vacations. This was the\narrangements at the end of last term and are the current arrangements.\nNatural Sciences\nDespite the merging of the 2 faculties of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences into Natural\nSciences, I\u2019ve been assured by College that this will have no affect of the students aca-demically. The division system of Life Sciences and department system of Physical Sciences will remain, at least for the foreseeable future. If you do feel there are problems\nor have concerns, please contact me or one of your Faculty representatives.\nWye\nAs mentioned in an article last week, changes are happening to Wye College and its\ncourse \u2013 Applied Business Management. The Deputy Rector went to speak to the\nstudents 2 weeks ago and then the proposals were approved by College as the way\nforward.\nThe ABM course will be an Imperial College course for all current students and those\nentering in 2006, through to the completion of their studies (~2009). All these students\nwill continue to receive the same degree and associateship of the as present. The staff\n(AEBM) will transfer to the University of Kent, retaining an honorary association with\nImperial, and will continue to deliver the course to Imperial students under formal agreement with Kent. In addition there will continue to be a component of the course delivered by Imperial academic staff who do not transfer to Kent.\nFrom the 2007 entry, the course will become a University of Kent degree, delivered by\nstaff of the University of Kent (but there will continue to be a component taught by Imperial staff) and will remain at the Wye campus. Students enrolling after 2007 will receive\na University of Kent degree (not a joint degree with Imperial), but there\u2019ll be a formal\nrecognition of Imperial\u2019s continued involvement. It\u2019s proposed that this would be through\nestablishing of an Associateship of Wye College awarded to those receiving a University\nof Kent degree.\nThere\u2019ll be a review of these arrangements in 2011, allowing two full years of graduates\nof Kent to have come through the course, so that both institutions can assess the value\nof the current arrangements.\nI will be in Wye on Friday 18th November, so if you do have any questions about this or\nanything else, feel free to come and see me then.\nEmail: president@imperial.ac.uk\nOr pop into the Union building, South Ken, first floor.\nRise to S.H.A.G...\nSarah Khatib - Deputy President (Education & Welfare\n\n"

    "content": "J\noel, you put forward some very interesting points in your response to Anushri\u2019s\ncolumn \u201cA Good God Would Not Kill\nPeople\u201d, the most offensive of which is\nyour view that \u201cwe are all in a desperate state\u201d.\nAs a non-Christian I find it arrogant of you to\ndecree that I \u201cdeserve a punishment\u201d for my life.\nUnless I repent to Jesus I am, in your eyes, morally and spiritually bankrupt.\nNow of course I know you don\u2019t actually believe\nthat and you would wish me all the happiness\nin my life no matter what my religious leanings,\nif any, but your three columns worth of Bible\nquotes struck a nerve in me that I wish to fiddle\nwith some more.\nAside from the fact that your response totally\nmissed the point of Anushri\u2019s original column,\nI was very interested to hear your views on\nsuffering as an inevitable consequence of \u201cGod\u2019s\njustice\u201d. In my opinion a God who is just and fair\nand eternally loving would not inflict pain and\nsuffering unto the innocent just because a few\nmiscreants defy his will. To me it sounds like\npure evil. Would you want to endorse a God that\npunished innocents for the wrongs of others?\nThat doesn\u2019t sound very loving to me.\nAllow me to quote from one of your favourite\nbooks, Revelations 13:8: \u201cAll people living on\nearth will worship [the devil] except those whose\nnames were written before the creation of the\nworld in the book of the living which belongs to\n[Jesus]\u201d\nDo I take it that because my name is not in\nthat book belonging to Jesus, that I worship\nthe devil and will face an eternal struggle in\nhell cavorting with Satan\u2019s bum pokers; that no\nmatter what my decisions in life are; to be good\nand honest, kind and loving to everyone to the\nbest of my ability; I shall still go to hell? Did God\nspecifically choose me to be punished? How\ndelightfully evil!\nDante said in his Divine Comedy, \u201cThe\ngreatest gift which God in his bounty bestowed\nin creating humans, and the most conformed\nto his own goodness, and that which he prizes\nthe most, was the freedom of the will.\u201d That\u2019s\nnice - it really is. The idea that with all his\nomnipotence and infinite wisdom, God still chose\nus to be his special children and gave us free will\n(not even his angels had that). I like that, I really\ndo. However, when you suggest that we are \u201clost\nin sin with no future\u201d unless we accept Jesus\n\u201cas [our] substitute [for punishment]\u201d it seems\nto stick two fingers up in the face of God\u2019s gift of\nfree will.\nBad things do happen, without a doubt, but\ninstead of blaming god, I believe we need to be\nmore introspective. The problems in the world\naren\u2019t caused by him at all; they\u2019re merely\na consequence of our actions. And natural\ndisasters? Well, it just so happens that the forces\nwe need to keep our planet alive are the same\nforces which will kill people, whether that is\nGod\u2019s will or not. I would rather imagine God as\na helpless God than a God who is vengeful and\ndestructive. I perceive evil as being vengeful and\ndestructive, and I certainly don\u2019t want to worship\nan evil God.\nI believe it was Bertrand Russell who said,\n\u201cThere is one very serious defect in Christ\u2019s\nmoral character, and that is that he believed\nin hell. I do not myself feel that any person\nwho is really profoundly humane can believe in\neverlasting punishment.\u201d If Jesus Christ really\ndid believe in hell as everlasting punishment,\nthen there was a serious defect in his character,\nand Christians have nothing less than a crisis on\ntheir hands.\nI\n\u2019ve been meaning to write this column\nfor weeks but unfortunately things like\nwork and extreme right wing tendencies\ngot in the way. I have briefly overcome\nboth these things to give you my idea on how\nwe could improve football. Well, not so much\nfootball itself. I\u2019m not going to try to sell you a\nBudweiser advert but rather improve football\nplayers. Nearly everyone thinks that football\nplayers are grossly overpaid and this was particularly brought home to me when I heard that\nthe Kettering town club, which Paul Gascoigne\nand some of his mates have just bought, might\ngo from semi-professional to fully professional!\nThey are in the conference, for God\u2019s sake.\nMost of them probably can\u2019t play better than a\nmember of the IC first team (who always used\nto be quite good but I still wouldn\u2019t pay them).\nTherefore, I feel we should switch to a system of\nno win-no fee. This system is very popular with\nsolicitors and I think it works something like this\n(I admit I have done no real research so someone called Alex might tell me all my facts are\nwrong and I\u2019m a Nazi but I\u2019m willing to take the\nrisk). If the solicitor doesn\u2019t win their case they\ndon\u2019t collect any fees (or only a very small percentage of it). However, if they do win, they can\ncharge up to double their normal fee.\nThis strikes me as the perfect solution for\nfootball. If footballers weren\u2019t so sure that\nthey would collect thousands of pounds, win or\nlose, they might be a lot more motivated and\npassionate. There has been a lot said about the\nlack of dedication of players. Liverpool\u2019s chief\nexecutive recently said, \u201cWe have never paid\nour players more and never been less sure that\nthey would die for the cause.\u201d I think that sums\nup present day football brilliantly. I\u2019m not saying\nthat all players are lazy and uncommitted.\nPlayers like Wayne Rooney strike me as very\npassionate. The fact he expresses his passion by\nbeing a complete twat is a different matter.\nSo I reckon footballers should only get their\nbig, fat, pay cheques if they win. Then each\nweek only half the clubs would have to pay out\nwages (this would also stop the clubs getting\ninto so much debt). I think that after a few weeks\nof defeat and a lack of new cars and velour\ntracksuits for their girlfriends (or boyfriends, we\nmust stop this homophobia in football), players\nin underperforming teams would be so riled\nup that they give everything they\u2019ve got for the\nfull 90 minutes. This might mean that tempers\nboil over a bit more often but, after all, football\nis a man\u2019s game! Maybe we could adopt the\nice hockey approach where, I believe, you are\nallowed three fights a match. Alternatively we\ncould adopt the rugby approach where players\nactually listen to the referee. Either way I think\nthat this could turn football into a much more\nlife or death sport, making matches as tense and\nas exciting as gladiatorial battle.\nAlternatively we could pay them a few hundred\npounds a week, like everyone else earns, and\nstop worshipping them because, at the end of\nthe day, they are simply kicking a ball around a\nfield. A sealion can do much better juggling than\nmost footballers and yet they only get paid fish.\nIs that really fair?\nI\nt seems the legislation is coming though\npretty soon, so I better say this now as I\nmay not be able to later. The boundaries of\nwhat is considered appropriate discourse on\nviolent actions need to be explored. In his struggle for African independence, Nelson Mandela\nwas deemed an extremist by the Apartheid\ngovernment of his day. Today he is a hero, yet\nironically the group he co-founded (Spear of\nthe Nation) was principally involved in a sabotage campaign against military, government\nand civilian targets. Today it is not violence\nbut views and language that are being deemed\nillegal. Similarly, Mahatma Ghandi led 300 million Indians in a struggle for independence from\nthe British Empire. Are such acts today to be\nconsidered as terrorism? Are we to conveniently\nbrush aside examples of history and apply a new\nset of rules for the injustices of the day?\nThere has been a deliberate marginalization\nof this discussion, due not only to the climate\nof fear but to the vast spectrum and polarity of\nviews. A student in the Officer Training Corps\nwill have hugely different views to the nature\nof a just war compared to a Palestinian activist.\nTo the activist, the Palestinian people who are\nunder a most brutal occupation, with massacres\nlike Jenin or the Ghettoization of Gaza and West\nBank, military resistance to state sponsored\nterrorism is justified. To the Chechnyan, the\nrecent scene of the Prime Minister yet again\nshaking hands with President Putin, after most\nof Groznyy has been smashed and 250, 000 of its\npeople killed, will be sickening. At almost every\nFriday Prayer comes the same supplication from\neven the most apolitical and pro-government\nImams, \u201cOh Allah, help the Mujahideen in Iraq,\nin Palestine, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Chechnya\u2026\u201d\nThere are crises that some would rather be\nimprisoned for than not to speak up.\nYet to the soldier, British or Israeli, the idea of\ncalling their work as state sponsored terrorism\nis offensive, as is the terrorist who is coming to\ntry and destroy the civilization they hold dear. In\ntheir view, they sincerely hold up their lives for\nthe protection of others, even at the behest of\ngovernments with doggy dossiers. No one should\nbe allowed to hold the view of Bin Laden, that a\ncivilian anywhere can be deliberately targeted.\nThis is taken as granted, but what about military\ntargets? Nobody wants to see death or really talk\nabout it, yet it is happening, and it is unreasonable to expect someone who thinks that they\nhave been so horribly wronged to roll over and\njust die because they happen to be on the wrong\nside of the argument or in the less fortunate\ncivilization.\nThis is a philosophical argument as to when\nmurder is permitted. If the new laws are applied\nas they \u2018should\u2019 be, then there is nothing to\nworry about. Nobody wishes to see political\ndebate stifled. Yet if the Government wishes to\nsee no opposition to its policies or the policies of\nother states that they have good diplomatic relations with, then there is a problem. It is an obligation upon all decent and good citizens to speak\nup against injustices wherever they are. There\nwill be mistakes made, but what is worse is leaving the situation to rot along with oppressed peo-ple. If we are silent then we are complicit in the\ncrimes against them. Speak up, come to campus\nevents, and help your fellow human beings. This\ngeneration has been vested with the authority\nand privelige that no other generation in the\npast has had, that is to actually enact global\nchange for the better.\nFootball revolution\nWhat does it mean to incite hatred?\nIain Heaton\nMeherzad Pahlan\nOn su\ufb00ering beliefs\n18\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 17 November 2005\nOmar Hashmi\nLiked it or loathed it?

The rain was\nheavy by now. As a keen, social\nrunner myself, I hoped to do well,\nprove my worth to the club and of\ncourse beat some of the guys from\nLSE. Unfortunately all hopes quickly evaporated as half the runners\nstreamed by in the first 200m.\nThe course lived up to its name as\nit was very much cross country. In\nfact some parts were like running\nin a river! I use the word \u2018running\u2019\nloosely here because it was more\nlike a careful balancing act when\nsliding down some slopes of the\ncourse \u2013 and that\u2019s when I was going\nup the hills! I sometimes felt as\nthough I was on a \u201cCross-Country\nTravelator\u201d as for every 3 strides\nforward, I\u2019d slide one back! This\nalong with the constant stream of\ngirls overtaking me did not make for\nan easy start to the race.\nDetermined to still do well and\nto at least get back some lost confidence (or may be it\u2019s just from being\nat Imperial too long) I decided to\nfollow the girls. With the increased\npace I started passing male runners\nfrom each club, whom I presumed\nwere the less fit ones. How na\u00efve\nwas I? My escalating confidence\nwas quickly shattered when the girls\nfinished and I was directed around\nfor another lap. No one told me the\nladies only did one lap and the men\ntwo did they? It suddenly dawned\non me that everyone else was pacing themselves! Knackered, it was\nnot really surprising that the next\nlap was not as fast and the track\nwas in an even worse state than\nbefore after so many fine athletes\nhad trampled over it. I did however\nfinish and managed to beat a few\npeople from the Imperial club.\nAfter the race came some more\nbanter with the other universities,\nteam photo and a quick change into\nrelatively dry clothes. Again with\nmost sporting events in England it\nwas off to the pub for a couple of post\nrun beers and a chance to dry off by\na warm fire.\nNow those of you who were in the\nUnion Wednesday night, you might\nhave been aware of some new faces\n\u2013 especially female ones! This was\nbecause Imperial Cross Country\nalso hosted the race social with a\nfew friendly beers and some gloating to the competition. Our men\u2019s\nfirst team are currently leading the\nUL universities and our women are\nsecond after some solid perform-ances.\nMe, well I had a few well earned\ndrinks \u2013 but not too many, I\u2019m in\ntraining for the next two laps of the\nnext race! For those of you who\nenjoy running, whether it be competitively or just to keep fit I recommend the training sessions in Hyde\nPark and also the races which are\nchallenging but great fun. Contact\nrun@ic.ac.uk for more information.\nCross Country\nSimon Nagle\nMy \ufb01rst run \u2013 Race Day!\nSo we returned to our home pitch at\nfortress Harlington, Having tasted\ndefeat the previous week we were\ndefinitely gunning for victory in this\nmatch. UCL 2nd XV started the\nmatch top of the league but under\nthe guidance of Andy Wright we were\nquick to show these jokers who the\ndaddies of London were. Within the\nfirst 10 mins, James \u2018Deep Throat\u2019\nFletcher made a fantastic break,\noffloading it to George Watkins to\nrun it in under the posts. Deep\nthroat slotted home the conversion\nand after some quality work form\nthe forwards we found ourselves\non their \u201922, where Deep Throat\ntook a quick pass from Penfold and\ncrashed through for the second try.\nThis was followed by\nAlex \u201c the pain train\u201d\nFergusson breaking\nthe UCL centre. The\npoor lad was bleeding\nfrom his head.\u201d\nUCL, slightly offended by the porn-star rugby that was being played,\ndecided to try to mount a comeback.\nAfter some fantastic defence from\nAndy, Theo and the Brown Bullet\nthey finally broke our defence and\nscored a try just before half time but\nfailed to convert. After a quick word\nfrom Davey G things got underway\nin the second half.\nUCL still fired up scored and con-verted, although that was the last\nthing that they could muster. IC\nstepped up a gear with some fantastic recycling of the ball and flowing\nmoves led to more points. Johnny\n\u2018I\u2019ve lost my wallet\u2019 the Jock, not\nhappy with reaching the try line,\nbattled like a warrior of Rhohan just\nso he could score under the posts.\nThis was followed by Alex \u201c the pain\ntrain\u201d Fergusson breaking the UCL\ncentre. The poor lad was bleeding\nfrom his head \u2026.. anyway.\nSome fantastic jumping from\nJames \u2018Donkey Dick\u2019 Davies meant\nthat the match was secured and\nthe fellowship of Silvia continues.\nNext match we will mostly be beating Cantebury and Christchurch\n\u2013 Again.\nMens Rugby\nICURFC 3rd XV 21\nUCL 2nd XV 12\nChris Gosden\nAndrea\u2019s 6th team cartel arrived\non the turf in buoyant mood after a\nconvincing win against the Kingpin\nof our division to keep us within a\ndrive-by\u2019s distance of the leaders.\nWe started off well enough, enjoying\na good spell of possession for the\nopening half hour, which we able to\ncapitalise on via a Hamish \u201cI will not\ndate thou unless thou\u2019s percentage\nbody fat is comparable to that of a\npork scratching\u201d Mooknaley goal. A\ndeft cross into the erogenous zone\nby Andriy from the right flank was\nmet by the Crouchy-esque stature\nof the Mook, who took the ball onto\nhis left before slotting a ball possessing the pace of a maths lecture\npast the static goalkeeper. Shev continued to dazzle with several winding manoeuvres whilst producing\nlonger runs than Jabba the Hut on\na laxative diet. The game soon fell\ninto a state of awkwardness when\ninform Callum left the field injured\nand we were forced to reshape. Like\na group of Karma Sutra novices,\nwe lacked the flexibility to adapt to\nour new positions and consequently allowed the rest of the half to\nslip silently into the rather solemn\natmosphere.\nHaving refreshed over the inter-val, we returned to the pitch hoping\nto play as smooth as we all think\nwe are when it comes to wooing\nthe ladies. Unfortunately we ended\nup playing almost as rough as the\ngirls who actually believed us as we\nstruggled to find any true rhythm.\nGKT inevitably resorted to their\nbeaver lever strumming ways as\ntheir second half ref began his reign\nof cheese churning. They maintained their consistently bad form\ninto the final \u201c45\u201d and we probably\nwould have ran more rings around\nthem than George Michaels\u2019s been\nin were it not for their unsporting\nuse of ringers, and the fact that\nbestiality has lost its chic upon hearing Mirandah\u2019s tales of fingering\ndecapitated poultry.\nThe game remained out of sorts\nuntil we eventually delivered the\nfinal blow about 20 minutes from\ntime. The ball was scrambled out\nfrom a corner before falling to Nam\n\u201cThe Lyrical G\u201d Nguyen, who poked\nthe ball to a bemused \u201cBig\u201d Ben\nHasted whose \u201cintentional\u201d scuff/\nwannabe strike found its way to\nMooknaley to hit a well taken volley\ninto the back of the net. Now despite\nscoring twice on the playing field,\nfor the benefit of McNelly, I feel it\nnecessary to quote a great general/\nslave/gladiator, who once said: \u201cWho\nwe do in life, echoes in fraternity,\u201d\nsince scoring with spherical objects\nshould be restricted purely to the\ngreen.\n\u201cGKT inevitably resorted to their beaver lever strumming\nways\u201d\nGKT finally decided to have a go\nat us and somehow managed to\nhit the woodwork twice before pulling one back through a long range\neffort which flew into the top corner.\nDespite these minor incidents our\nkeeper Shaz played an impressive\ngame and our tight defensive formation consisting of Ricky, AD and\nYong acting in a sweeper role meant\nwere we able to block more canals\nthan a Big Mac.\nCaptain Andrea continued to pimp\nus bee-hutches from the sideline\nthroughout the match, although his\nimmense oral support left us confused as to who should be doing\nthe pimping. (I think he charges \u00a35\nan hour anyway.) Simon \u201cthe Dark\nKnight\u201d and Ian Mirandah worked\ntirelessly upfront to ensure they\ncovered more ground than the frikkin\u2019 congestion charge, whilst Amin\nand Robb \u201cthe nipple patch kid\u201d\nYates preyed on the flanks.\nThe game eventually ended after\na 55 min half, but proved to be good\npreparation for our next match,\nwhich we played last Saturday.\nHaving arrived an hour and a half\nlate, GKT 5ths continued to be a\ncomplete bunch of spoons from\nwhich it was clear that their lives\nhad experienced as much personal\ngrowth as an erection (although this\nis construed as a compliment if you\nconsider IC 6th personnel). We drew\nthat match 0-0 in what was a frus-tratingly disappointing match.\nOn a final note, our thoughts go\nout to Callum Little, who efforts in\nthe GKT 4ths match were rewarded\nwith a fractured ankle.

However,\npeace is definitely not in the bag for\nthem this year as Hogwarts is about\ntohosttheTriwizardChampionships.\nUnfortunately for Harry, despite his\nage definitely being below 16, he is\nabout to participate in the deadlie-set game of the season.\nFor those who have read Harry\nPotter, you\u2019ll notice the increasing presence of a dark forces with\neach book. Mike Newell, of Four\nWeddings fame and director of\nthis film, has perfectly created a\nmovie that captures the essence of\nthe Dark Lord Voldemort (played\nsuperbly by Ralph Fiennes) and his\neffect on the wizarding community.\nNewell\u2019s film may surprise some\nof you who thought that the previous films weren\u2019t up to much. Goblet\nof Fire made me shriek, laugh and\ncry. The scriptwriters have added\na few humourous scenes with Ron\n(Rupert Grint) swearing even more\n(he never did that in the books) and\nHermione (Emma Watson) implying that Victor Krum (Stanislav\nIanevski) would have liked a \u201cmore\nphysical\u201d relationship with her; the\nhorror!\nH\narry Potter is back with\nanother blockbuster\nhit: The Goblet Of Fire.\nSome of you will love it\nbut the rest may loathe\nit. However, if you make the effort to\nsee this one, your opinion of Harry\nPotter might be changed forever.\nDuring the two and a half hours we\nare taken through the highs and\nlows of Harry Potter\u2019s fourth year\nin Hogwarts. Intense moments are\nbroken up by humour and breathtaking special effects are interspersed with poignant scenes. The\nchildren are growing up and things\nare changing for the worse in the\nwizarding world.\nWhen I first heard that I was going\nto the National Press Screening of\nHarry Potter: The Goblet of Fire, I\nscreamed (yes, I love Harry Potter\nand I\u2019m not ashamed of it). Although\nI appreciated the entertainment\nvalue of the first two films, film three\nwas what brought the books alive for\nme for the first time. It was deep,\ndark and moving. Goblet of Fire has\ntaken it once step further than the\nrest, being a film lovers of the books\nand novices alike can appreciate.\nAfter a summer of haunting night-Harry returns to Hogwarts, complete with dragons, mermaids and teenage angst\nDark times lie ahead, Harry...\nHere\u2019s your chance to\nshow off your fabulous\nwizarding knowledge. The\nperson or persons who get\nthe most questions right\nwill win a pair of tickets to\nsee Harry Potter and the\nGoblet of Fire at any Vue\nCinema. Email answers to\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nbefore Monday.\nIf you decide to go you\u2019ll be thoroughly entertained, but go with an\nopen mind. For those hardened\nHarry Potter fans, you may have\nhigh expectations but Newell misses\nout Winky, most of the Quidditch\nWorld Cup and the audience never\nfinds out how Rita Skeeter gets all\nthe gossip. At first this annoyed me,\nas Hermione\u2019s S.P\n.E.W campaign in\nthe books stemmed from Winky\u2019s\nmistreatment at the hands of Barty\nCrouch (played by Trigger, sorry\nRoger Lloyd Pack), but Goblet of\nFire is too bloody long.

    "content": "Sport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n6th XI Dominate\nKings College!\nMens Football\nImperial College 6th XI 3\nKings College 6th XI 1\nAndrea Faggiani\nThe mighty IC 6ths turned up at\nHarlington for their first home game\nof the season. Things were not looking too good following Wednesdays\ndefeat away to LSE. Today was the\nturn of Kings 6ths, who before this\nwere in top spot in the league with 4\ngames and 4 wins, having conceded\njust 2 goals and scored 17. That\nwas soon going to change though.\nCaptain Andrea, still out due to the\nhorrendous knee injury sustained at\nQueen Marys in the last game of the\nlast season back in March decided\nto opt for a radically different forma-tion. It was going to be a dynamic 3\n5 2. Andriy \u201cShevchenko\u201d Gelman\nwas in goal, with Adrien Doyle acting as a sweeper behind Ricky Verra\nand Tom Crockatt, whose job was\nto mark the Kings strikers. Any Li\nand Callum Little were acting as\nwing backs, with Hamish McNelly,\nXiyong Huang, and Ben Hasted in\nthe centre of the park. Up front\nIan Mirandah and Simon \u201cbatman\u201d\nParker were looking for the goals.\nThe game started off and Andrea\u2019s\ntactical awareness was soon appar-ent. The Kings front two could get\nnothing off us, and Andy and Callum\nwere controlling their wingers and\ngoing forwards at just the right\ntimes. Our centre mid trio was in\ncomplete control and Ian and Simon\nalways looked dangerous.\nAbout 30 minutes in the game\na quick move down the right saw\nSimon centre the ball into the box,\nwith Andy screaming down the left\nhand side and knocking the ball powerfully past the keeper. 1-0!!! Kings\ntried to get them selves together\nand did play some good football, but\nwe were careful and focused until\nthe break. They had one shot on\ngoal, but Shev flew to the top right\nhand corner and palmed the ball\naway for a cracking save. We went\nclose on a couple of corners but\nwere happy to end the half with just\na slender lead. Rob Yates replaced\nCallum at right wing back, and Nam\nreplaced Andy on the left. They had\nrun so much in the first half that\nthey could barely breathe!!!\nThe second half started with Kings\nagain on the front foot, trying to\nattack us, but they were frustrated\nby our constant breaks as soon as\nwe would get possession. It was one\nof these breaks that led to our sec-ond. As swift move on the right let\ndo a lightning quick one two between\nHamish and Ben, who then release\nXiyong in open space just outside\nthe Kings box. He unleashed a\nfurious drive with the outside of\nhis right boot which curled into the\ntop left corner almost breaking the\nnet. Amazing goal and we went\nmental!!!!\nKings really started piling up some\npressure after this, and managed to\npull one back about 15 minutes from\ntime, with a long range effort by one\nof their strikers. Not to worry. We\nbounced back and didn\u2019t let them\ntry to equalize. We went forwards in\nnumbers just like at the beginning\nof the match, and a great through\nball found Ian one on one with the\nkeeper. Just like in previous games\nthe outcome of that is just one: goal.\n3-1 and we were cruising!\nAnd that\u2019s how it ended. An awesome team performance all round.\nOur defence was flawless, with AD\neven making some surging runs\nforwards and causing havoc in the\nKings defence. The midfield trio\nwas working wonders and the two\nstrikers always caused problems.\nCallum, Nam, Andy and Rob ran\ntheir socks off in their newly-dis-covered wing back positions and all\nplayed really well. Lets keep it going\nlads! Bring it on!\nFor once the team managed to get\noff to a remarkable start; there was\na full team of players, semi-compe-tent umpires and Fanny Pants even\nremembered the VAT receipt for our\ntrek to Kennington Park. Were these\nomens for the match ahead?\nThe game started well with Top\nHeavy managing to intercept the\npush back and driving up into the\nattacking half. However it took about\n15 minutes before Ghostbuster managed to get a quick pass to Grandma\nwho scored her first goal for IC.\nGKT tried to pressure IC into giving\nthem the ball but they weren\u2019t having any of it. 1 Under, J.D., 3 Times\na Lady and India all worked hard to\nmake sure those medics didn\u2019t get\nhold of the ball which lead to some\ngreat play by IC which was swiftly\nfollowed by Grandma scoring her\nsecond of the day. The half time\nwhistle went and after the usual\npraise for ourselves, Fanny Pants\ngave an inspirational half time talk.\nIt was time for more goal pie and to\nbeat the medic scum. We instantly got to work with Porno, ButtF**cker and Laura working hard in\nthe middle to aid Grandma to her\nhat-trick. The quick passing continued and Grandma got two more.\nPlay switched and after a few unsuccessful short corners IC got their\nsixth goal. No it wasn\u2019t Grandma\nthat scored this but Top Heavy from\na sensational strike at the top of the\nD. This was followed by a lapse in\nconcentration by India who deservedly gained \u2018Twat of the Match\u2019 for\nhitting the ball backwards between\nher legs because she didn\u2019t know\nwho to pass to! IC quickly got back\nto form and gained a short corner\njust as the final whistle blew. It was\na tense moment but was aided by\nsome inspiring team play. Grandma\npushed out, struck by Top Heavy,\nkept in the D by Butt-F**cker, off\nthe back line by Porno finally before\nDominator scored her first IC goal.\nThis along with some great tackling earned Dominator \u2018Man of the\nMatch\u2019. A special mention goes to\nFanny Pants who didn\u2019t touch the\nball throughout the entire match.\nThe game was ended in the usual\nway with team sprit, fantastic teas\nand the usual frenzy at the union!\nLadies Hockey\nGKT 4th XI 0\nImperial College 2nd XI 7\nFiona Jamieson\n2nd team demolition\nsquad ensure win for\nhockey ladies\nValiant sevenths snatch defeat from\nthe jaws of victory\nTottenham lost to Grimsby in\nSeptember. Manchester United\nwere destroyed by York City in\n1995. Hereford famously dumped\nNewcastle out of the FA Cup in 1972.\nSugar Ray Robinson, the most complete boxer of all time even managed to lose to \u201cThe Leamington\nLicker\u201d, Randy Turpin all the way\nback in 1951. The end of the Mighty\nMighty Sevens 100% start to the\nseason, however, is surely a sporting\nupset to top them all.\n\u201cSeveral SOAS half-chances were snuffed\nout by Wongy and\nPaul \u201cthe shark\u201d\nSchaack\u201d\nSOAS began the game brightly\nand were clearly eager to have a\npop at the Sevens, who had up until\nthis point dominated ULU Division\n4 ruthlessly. The absence of Coach\nDuncan and his steel drum backing\nband was clearly having a detrimental effect on the Sevens, who\nwere struggling to get into their\nusual Brazilian-style samba rhythm.\nSeveral SOAS half-chances were\nsnuffed out by Wongy and Paul \u201cthe\nshark\u201d Schaack at the back as IC\nspent the majority of the first half\ncamped in their own, er, half and\nwere limited to trying to sneak a goal\non the break. Super Rich McSherry\nwent closest with a left footed drive\nacross goal after a great run down\nthe left wing. A SOAS goal had been\non the cards for a while when a rare\ndefensive lapse left their striker\none on one with our top secret tri-allist goalkeeper (let\u2019s call him M\nBanger\u2026actually, no, that\u2019s too easy\nlet\u2019s say Matty B \u2013 well come on, if\nFamily Guy can steal so blatantly\noff the Simpsons then so can I) and\nthe striker made no mistake to give\nSOAS the lead. The goal helped to\nwake the sleeping Sevens from their\nslumbers, and IC ended the half\nwith the first stirrings of Brazilian\nfire in their loins.\nSam\u2019s improved half-time team\ntalk fired the Sevens up, and the\nequaliser came shortly after the\nrestart. I now have to deviate slightly off-topic to explain the subject of\nIC\u2019s Fantasy Football league \u2013 you\npick a team made up of IC players\nand score points according to who\nscores, and, more importantly, who\ngets the assists. IC football club\ntakes on a whole new level of importance when Fantasy Football begins.\nAnyway, the reason I am\n\u201cThe 7\u2019s sat too deep,\nSOAS scored 2 goals.\n\u2018Balls\u2019, as they say in\nBolton\u201d\ntelling you this is because I got the\nassist, and that gets me points. Oh\nthe goal was pretty good as well, Pas\npoking the ball past the keeper after\nrunning onto Sam\u2019s lobbed through\nball (a.k.a: long ball). This was more\nlike it, and IC pressed hard for a\nsecond. A chance came with a free-kick on the corner of the SOAS area\nand Sam\u2019s beautiful curling cross\nwas nodded in by Sandy at the back\nstick to make the score Sam Styles 2\nassists \u2013 SOAS 1.\n2-1 up with 10 minutes to play and\neverything is looking \u201cmuito bem\u201d\nas they say in Rio\u2026maybe. Well,\nyou know the rest. The 7\u2019s sat too\ndeep, SOAS scored 2 goals. \u201cBalls\u201d,\nas they say in Bolton.\nMens Football\nImperial College 7th XI 2\nSOAS 2nd XI 3\nSam Styles\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the point in going to\nsleep when you are drunk\u201d has got\nto be the quote of the day courtesy of Tim and also summarised\nthe state of some of our players\non a cold Sunday afternoon down\nin Raynes Park. The last minute\nfill in for another team meant the\nRSM turned up with an impressive\n11 at the end of reading week. The\ngame started at a pace and continued so throughout the first half. It\nwas an especially close half, with\nboth teams matched in possession\nand shots on goal. It ran into injury\ntime as Pikey took a particularly\nbad hit to his foot from a well hit ball\njust outside the D. This was after\nRach got confused as to which team\nshe was playing for and passed to a\nStrollers player (note \u2013 playing for\nthe opposition the week before obviously is too confusing\u2026.)\nAfter a relaxed interlude the game\ngot underway for the second half\nwith Tim running all over the left\nwing with excellent support upfront\nby Leon and Dasha.

    "content": "ries\u201d. \u201cWe welcome the recognition\nof nuclear facilities as a terrorist\ntarget. However the bill has implications for peaceful protestors,\u201d stated\nCND in a press statement.\nThere were also concerns about\nthe vagueness of the new penalty\noutlawing the \u2018glorification\u2019 of ter-rorism, which was passed last week\nwith a majority of one. As well as\nthe concerns that \u201cOne man\u2019s freedom fighter is another man\u2019s terrorist\u201d (and as a result, supporters of\nNelson Mandela would be arrested\nfor glorifying his \u2018terrorist activities\u2019), more concerned MP\u2019s, such\nas Lembit \u00d6pik, tabled an early day\nmotion pointing out that the celebration of Guy Fawkes night would be\n\u2018glorifying\u2019 terrorism, and as a result\nwould be banned (a point made all\nthe more ironic by the fact that the\nhouse is holding a exhibition about\nGuy Fawkes this month), and the\ndanger of preaching double stand-ards. Lembit has been particularly\nscathing of the new bill, claiming\nthat the \u2018internment\u2019 plans of the\ngovernment damaged attempts at\ncreating a peace agreement during\nthe troubles in Northern Ireland,\nand that it would create the same\ntrouble if applied now.\nAs the amendment was being discussed in the Lords, it was overwhelmingly supported, with the only\nconcerns raised being over silly mat-ters, such as whether gay people\nwill sue the NHS for discrimination\nif they are refused treatment.\nAfter the amendment was passed\nAlon told Felix, \u201cI am delighted that\nthe government has come around to\nsupport amending the Equality Bill.\nThis is a big victory for everyone\nwho campaigned to outlaw this dis-crimination. Together with pressure\nfrom trade unions, Stonewall and\nmany other groups and individuals,\nwe have managed to get the government to see sense and outlaw homophobic discrimination now.\u201d\nImperial student\u2019s\nvictory on gay rights\nWhilst all this feverish discussion\nwas taking place, over in the House\nof Lords Imperial student Alon OrBach was celebrating after \u201cone of\nthe quietest government U-turns\u201d\nwas passed due to campaigning from\nthe Labour campaign for Lesbain\nand Gay Rights (LCLGR).\nAlon, who is the co-chair of the\nLCLGR, helped campaign during\nthe Labour party conference earlier\nthis year to make discrimination on\nthe grounds of sexual orientation\nan offence, which attained a 100%\nvote at the conference in favour of\namending the Equality Bill.\nT\nhe 9th of November saw a\nmass of debate and argument that saw the age old\nHouse of Commons as a\nwitness to one of the most\npassionate battles to have occurred\nin recent times, namely the argument over the government\u2019s new\nterrorism bill and more specifically\nwhether to pass the amendment\nto allow terrorist suspects to be\ndetained for 90 days without charge.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a\nrock for the past week you would\nhave undoubtedly known that this\nwas rejected; the first time the\nGovernment has lost a \u2018whipped\nvote\u2019, where Labour ministers were\ntold how they should vote. Although\nthis has been pounced on as a\nmoment where Tony Blair has lost\npower, this is not the complete story,\nor far from the end of the matter.\nAlthough some civil right campaigners might be popping champagne corks over the government\u2019s\ndefeat, there are still many points\nof the new bill to boil their blood.\nOutside the Houses of Parliament\nthere was a rally by various civil\nrights groups, including CND,\nLiberty and Amnesty amongst many\nothers, lobbying against several\naspects of the bill. CND themselves\nwere concerned that the new bill\nwould be used to clamp down on\npeaceful protest on nuclear facili-ties, as a clause in the new terrorism\nbill will make trespass on a nuclear\nsite an offence, \u201cincluding the area\naround the\u2026fences and bounda-Judgement day for Tony Blair\npolitics politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNearly 50 Labour MPs rebel to force the \ufb01rst Labour defeat in a \u2018whipped vote\u2019\n.\nDespite controversey, other terror proposals still pass.\nIn the Lords, a quiet U-turn as Imperial student\u2019s campaign passes through.\nDebate came to a\nhead when \u201cWe are\nnot a police state\u201d\nwas shouted at\nTony Blair\nMatthew Hartfield\nPolitics Editor\nThese points, along with the 90-day\ndetention plan, caused some feverish debate in the house, which came\nto a head during the prime minister\u2019s questions as Conservative MP\nCharles Walker shouted \u201cWe are not\na police state\u201d towards Tony Blair.\n\u201cWe are not living in a police state,\nbut we are living in a country that\nfaces a real and serious threat of\nterrorism; terrorism that wants to\ndestroy our way of life; terrorism\nthat wants to inflict casualties on us\nwithout limit\u201d replied an obviously\nseething prime minister.\nWhen you consider all these hur-dles, the fact that only the 90-day\ndetention amendment was rejected\nby the government, with the 28-day detention amendment passed\nstraight afterwards (which gives\nthe UK some of the longest detention time in the world; the US can\nonly hold suspects for 7 days before\ncharging or releasing them) makes\nthis appear (albiet not obviously) as\nan overall success for the Labour\ngovernment, with the bare bones\nof their bill passing through the\ncommons successfully. With the\nfirst defeat in their eight-year reign\noccurring though, it is clear Tony\nBlair no longer has the stranglehold\nover the commons he once had,\nand indeed this will cause problems\nwhen passing through the raft of\nreforms he has got lined up on education and other public services.\nIt looks as if, however, he still has\nenough power to run the government for now, with it looking likely\nthat he will still serve out a full third\nterm without facing a major revolt,\nwith a vote of no confidence looking\nextremly unlikely.\n7\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 17 November 2005\nAfter his defeat last Wednesday, Tony Blair labelled some of his MP\u2019s\nas being \u201cout of touch\u201d\nhe \ufb01ght against the HIV epidemic\nD\nescribed by the UN\nSecurity Council as the\nfastest growing threat\nto human develop-ment, responsible for\n8000 deaths each day and currently\ninfecting 40 million people world-wide, the global AIDS pandemic is\nnot something we can choose to\nignore. Nor can it be argued that\nit is being ignored; on the contrary,\nthe past twenty years have seen\nphenomenal advances in pharmaceuticals such that HIV sufferers\nin the West are now living longer\nthan could ever have been expected.\nThe area in which we have not seen\nadvances is that of universal access\nto treatment.\n95% of those living with HIV live\nin the developing world. Only 15%\nof those in need of treatment have\naccess to antiretroviral drugs. With\nthe vast majority of new infections\noccurring in those of working age,\nHIV is having a dramatic impact\non the economic productivity and\nsocial structure of many nations. It\nis predicted that the pandemic will\nbe responsible for the reversal of\nmany of the development gains that\nhave been made over the past 50\nyears in some of the worst affected\ncountries.\nSo what is being done? The pandemic has not escaped the attention of the global community. In\nfact, it has led to the formation of\na number of high profile initiatives.\nThe Millennium Development Goals\ninclude \u201cthe halt and reversal of\nthe spread of HIV by 2015\u201d, as one\nof their targets; the WHO has been\npushing for greater access to drugs\nthrough its \u20183 by 5\u2019 campaign, aiming\nto get 3 million people onto treatment by the year 2005. The Global\nFund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria\nhas been set up as a financing mechanism to offer financial support to\nthe fight, and President Bush has\nsent up his own body, the President\u2019s\nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief\n(PEPFAR). Most recently we have\nseen the pledge made by G8 leaders\nto ensure universal access to treatment by the year 2010.\nWhat must however be questioned\nis what impact these initiatives can\nhave. Criticised from the outset for\ntargeting the easy to reach rather\nthan those who were in greatest\nneed, the \u20183 by 5\u2019 initiative is almost\ncertain to fail by the end of the year,\nas by June 2005 only one third of\nits target was receiving treatment.\nPresident Bush\u2019s pledge to fight\nHIV and AIDS may win him votes,\nbut the reality is that the restrictions placed on spending are likely to\nnegate much of the perceived good.\nOne third must be used to promote\nabstinence and condoms can only be\noffered to groups considered \u2018high\nrisk\u2019. This blind approach ignores\nimportant details, such as that a\nhuge proportion of new infections\nare occurring amongst married\nwomen, for whom \u2018being faithful\u2019\nis clearly not sufficient protection.\nFurthermore, PEPFAR funding can\nonly be used to buy patented drugs,\nwhich results in four times fewer\npeople being treated than if generic\ndrugs were purchased.\nIn addition, it must be acknowledged that irrespective of the failures of individual initiatives, the HIV\npandemic is not something that can\nbe tackled independently of other\ndevelopment issues. While many\ncountries\u2019 debt repayments continue\nto be more than double that which\nthey receive in aid; while there are\nno effective measures to help prevent the continuous migration of\nhealth care workers to the north;\nand while the global trading system\ncontinues to unfairly discriminate\nagainst poorer nations, the formation of new initiatives are unlikely to\ntruly halt the HIV pandemic.\nMedsin-Imperial is holding a\nweek of events looking at HIV/AIDS\nboth in the UK and abroad: union.\nimperial.ac.uk/medics/medsin.\nContact: oliver.todd@imperial.\nac.uk for more details.\nFlora Ogilive\nMedsin-UK Secretary\n\n"
