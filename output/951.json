    "content": "Feature\n4 December 1992 Felix 951\nNo More Sex War\nMimi Chakraborty, reads a lot into a book that tried to change the world.\nOnce in a while, out of the big blue,\na book comes along which\nchallenges the currency of accepted\nthought, overturns ingrained pre-conceptions, and effectively\nradical is esa generation. One such\nbook was Kate Milletts' 'Sexual\nPolities', and another, Germaine\nGreer's 'The Female Eunnuch'.\nWhen in September 1992 Neil\nLyndon published 'No More Sex\nWar: The Failures of Feminism',\nit's clear he hoped it would be a third. Lyndon promised that 'No\nMore Sex War' would be 'the\nearthquake which would succeed in\nshattering the feminist myth'.\nIn America, the men's movement\nhas achieved no small degree of\nprominence, particularly in the last\ncouple of years, with the\nconsciousness raising groups of\nRobert Bly's 'Iron lohn' attracting\nwide public support. In Britain,\nhowever, Neil Lyndon has penned\nthe first attempt at a truly\ndestructive attack on feminism from\nsomeone not on the right of the\npolitical spectrum. Lyndon, an ex-Times journalist in his mid-forties,\nproposes to prove without doubt\n'That the feminist movement has\n... the feminist\nmovement had\ngone fishing\ncirca 1979 and\nnever\nreturned...\nnot only of itself failed, but that its\neffects had been so far-reaching and\nin si duo us that it had threatened the\nvery destruction of an entire\ngeneration.'\nAnyone who (like myself)\nthought that the feminist movement\nhad gone fishing circa 1979 and\nnever returned, will find 'No More\nSex War' a surprise. Specifically\nhis invocation of a 'maniacal\nfeminist sisterhood', powerful\nenough to reorder society\nThe thesis of Lyndon's debate lies\nin his claim that it is men and not\nwomen, who are discriminated\nagainst by the legal system, by\nsociety and by the economy. He\nseeks to expose the 'feminist\nconspiracy' within the courts, and\ngoes on to extrapolate this\nconspiracy through every level of\nsociety, to the extent that he feels\nthat men have become\ndisenfranchised, second-class\ncitizens.\nLyndon goes on to say that the\nsuccesses of women in the last thirty\nyears, relative to all centuries\nprevious, were entirely, not partly,\nattributable to increased access to\nhigher education, contraception and\nabortion. These were all available\nto women some years before Kate\nMillett wrote 'Sexual Polities', the\np pint in time which Lyndon locates\nas the genesis of the feminist\nmovement. This one semantic point\nis in itself sufficient for Lyndon to\nfeel he can deny the validity of the\nentire women's movement.\nHowever, though Millett's work\nwas very significant in the history\nof feminism, is ludicrous to suggest\nthat it was its origin. Mary\nWolstencroft's 'Vindication of the\nRights of Woman' was written\nmore than a hundred years before\nMillett was even born. In any case,\nthe suffragette movement was\nnothing if not a galvani s ation of\nwomen demanding their rights, and\nthe experience of two world wars\npre-emp ted much social change\nwhich Lydon is happy to overlook.\nNevertheless, these are the points\nthat Neil Lyndon has elected to\nmake, and it is worth taking time\nto express them blandly, without the\nassociated rhetoric with which the\nbook is suffused. The most striking\n..referring to\nwomen as\nhoods... and to\nfeminism as the\n'Great\nTerror'...\nthing about this book; is not the\npaucity of argument, but the\nve nemo us subjectivity of the\nlanguage. Lydon consistently refers\nto women as 'hoods' (sisterhood),\nand to feminism as the 'Great\nTerror'. He declares himself to be\n'sick to the back teeth of being\nfucked over by tiresomely angry\nwomen'. He casually offers his\nopinion on feminist equality as 'that\ntowering edifice of bullshit'. After\nsuch choice morsels as 'my entire\nadult life has been spent under the\ninfluence of this poisonous\northodoxy' he insists that 'I can find\nfew things more serious in our\nsociety than the presence amongst\nus of a totalitarian group,\nlegitimated (sic) by fashion, office\nand place, whose wicked and vain\northodoxies are influencing the\noperations of the courts and of\ncommerce and are inhibiting\nexpression in all its most compelling\nforms.'\nLyndon's message threatens to\nlose itself in the pomposity of its\nown language, he seems to have a cosy fondness for quasi-marxist\ncomparisons, where almost\nanything he can get his hands on is\ndescribed as some kind of\ntotalitarian hegemony. This is a sad\nreflection on a persistent theme\nwithin the book. It might nave been\nbig in the sixties to transcribe\nmarxist ideologies onto any\norganisation, but it's a bit silly now,\neven marxists aren't maxis ts any\nmore, and even radical baby\nboomers are going to have to kiss\nthat particular fantasy goodbye. The\nsixties present Lyndon with a host\nof problems that he seems unable\nto come to terms with, the shock of\nthe explosion of feminism and the\nindignity of having his\nconsciousness forcefully raised,\nbeing but two. These perhaps offer\nvaluable clues as to why he is so\nangry, and he lays the blame\nsquarely at the feet of his\nPage 10\n\n"

It is certain\nhowever, that other physical threats\nwere made, and J's representatives\n- having been informed of these -offered to cancel the show.\nIn spite of all the drama, the\nconcert went ahead as planned\nwithout any trouble. This is\npossibly due to the 'substantial'\nPolice security that arrived when\nnews of potential violence reached\nthem, but it is believed more likely\nthat the embryonic Nazi element\nfailed to arrive.\nA substantial staff shake up in the\nHumanities Department of Imperial\nCollege was officially revealed this\nweek.

A survey of more than 300\nmedical students at Bristol\nUniversity showed that one in five\nfifth year medics have debts of over\n\u00a35,000. The survey has prompted\nthe Scottish British Medical\nAssociation (BMA) to seek ways of\nrelieving debt related stress in\nmedical students.\nThe Scottish BM A has\napproached the Clydesdale Bank\nabout the possibility of setting up a debt counselling service. A spokeswoman for the BM A in\nScotland said 'the matter of student\ndebt is sufficiently serious to have\ndeans of medical schools ask us\nabout counselling newly qualified\ndoctors'. Nick Steele, chairman of\nthe BM A Medical Students' group,\nsaid he hoped a Scottish pilot\nscheme would be extended to other\nparts of the United Kingdom.\n'Medical graduates have excellent\nprospects of repaying their debts,'\nhe said.\nThe move follows the negotiation\nof a \u00a310,000 loan package for\nstudents enrol ing on Nottingham\nTrent University's Law Society\nfinal examinations. The Royal Bank\nof Scotland has agreed to lend up\nto \u00a3500,000 to students on the legal\npractice course, to be re payed up to\nfive or seven years after\nqualification. Interest is to be\ncharged at preferential rates.\nWarwick Boar Censure Threat\nThe Warwick University Students\nUnion is set to wrap the knuckles\nof its own student newspaper this\nweek. The move follows allegations\nin last weeks issue of the Warwick\nBoar concerning the use of election\nfunds in sabbatical elections and\nunethical practice by the personal\nassistant to a member of the shadow\ncabinet.\nThe Warwick Boar is now facing\na motion of censure at today's Union General Meeting. Union\nsabbatical officers, elected on a Labour Party 'slate', have\ncondemned 'unethical practice' at\nthe newspaper, and the Union\ntreasurer is reported to have\nthreatened to cut the paper's budget\nafter the publication of the story. A 'Boar' editorial says that the affair\nis 'the tip of the iceberg', and has\naccused Labour sabbatical\ncandidates of irregular election\nprocedures.\nMr Bob Wilkinson, Personal\nAssistant to Labour treasury\nspokeswoman, Harriet Harman, is\nreported to have used computer\nequipment at the University of\nWarwick for private constituency\nwork. Personal details of a Peckham constituent were found on\na computer disk at the University\nStudents' Union. The contents of\nthe disk, which is used in the\nUnion's general office, were\nuncovered by students working for\nthe Warwick Boar. The letter was\nprinted on the front page of last\nweeks Boar with the name and\naddress of the constituent blanked\nout.\nThe General Secretary of\nWarwick University Students'\nUnion, Mr Adam Lemon, said that\nMrs Harman faxed constituency\nmaterial to Mr Wilkinson, while he\nwas spending the weekend at\nWarwick. The material included the\ncase details of a man facing\ndeportation from Britain. Mr Lemon said that Mrs Harman had\nasked for the letter to be written\n'pretty quickly'. Emma Keeling, a student on the 'Warwick Boar', said\nthat seven pages of constituency\nrelated documents had been found\non the disk. She added that these\nincluded a press release, an address\ndirectory, surgery notes, and the\nletter which was published by the\nBoar.\nMr Lemon claimed that the story\nwas designed to discredit Labour\ncandidates standing in Union\nelections next spring, and said\n'there is no question of a misuse of\nfunds'. He added that Mr Wilkinson\npaid for the use of union equipment,\nbut Mr Lemon could not recall how\nmuch was paid, or when the\npayment was made.\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nFelix 951 4 December 1 992\ngeneration.\nT am disappointed to the soles of\nmy boots that my generation which\npromised so much, should have\ndelivered so little by way of radical\nchange.. .much of the responsibility\nof that conspicuous failure I attribute to the influence of\nfeminism and to the perverted\naccount of personal relations and of\nsocial composition which feminism\nhas fostered.'\nNowhere does Lyndon address\nthe paradox of how a movement\nwith so little support amongst even\nwomen, let alone men, could come\nby such a degree of mysterious and\nsinister power.\nThe level of this kind of abusive\nattack continues throughout the\nbook, and if the consistency of his\ninvective continues to shock, then\nthe content no longer does. It comes\nas no surprise that Lyndon believes\nrape to be an event which is 'over-reported', and instances of child-abuse to be 'willfully magnified'.\nLyndon discounts the problem of\ndomestic violence altogether,\narguing that, since the number of\nplaces for women in refuges in the\nUK is about 650 (excluding\nchildren) that it seems that women\nare obligingly able to arrange their\nlives so as not to exceed this\nnumber. He goes on to complain\n'What the hell has happened to us\nas a generation, as a nation, a people, that the plight of 650\nwomen should be treated with so\nvery much more sympathy and\npolitical energy than a million\npeople who may have to have no\nhome?'. Quite apart from the fact\nthat every social injustice is as valid\nas the next to those who experience\nit, and that to establish a qualitative\nhierarchy is an invidious route to\ntake, this kind of breathtaking\npropensity to pirro u hette over\nstatistics is a disturbing feature of\nLyndon's work.\n... breathtaking\npropensity to\npirouette over\nstatistics...\nNeil seems to have trouble also\nwith the idea that women might be\ndiscriminated against in the\nworkplace. When proposing that\nthe number of women in Parliament\nwas not artificially low, he takes a step out of the quagmire of\nstatistical analysis, and proceeds\nsimply to guess values of his own.\n'Despite all the evidence to the\ncontrary, let's assume that male-prejudice is a genuine obstruction\nto women candidates, let's guess\nthat male prejudice might account\nfor the absence of fifty MPs, that\nstill leaves two hundred women\nMPs missing from the house.'\nThe reason, Lydon thoughtfully\ninforms us is 'Babies'.\nI propose a different tack, let's assume that male prejudice isn'ta genuine obstruction to women\ncandidates, let's guess that male\nprejudice might account for the\nabsence of precisely zero female\nMPs, from a total of around 600\nMPs, around 300 should be\nmost noteworthy feature about these\nfeatures was that they were all\nwritten by women, Lydon\nunwittingly awoke the sleeping\nbeauty of the feminist sisterhood,\nand they returned an impressive\nperformance offering extensive\ncritical review by amongst others\nGermaine Greer, Helena Kennedy\nQC, Fay Weldon, Yvonne Roberts,\nKate Millet, Angela Lambert,\nNigella Lawson, lu lie Birchill,\nBeatrice Campbell, and even\nLyndon's estranged wife, Deidre.\nAndrew Neil and Melvyn Bragg\nconversely, were peculiarly reticent\neven in interviewing Lyndon,\nneither really questioned Lyndon\ninured to the kind of slow anger I ended up feeling. Lyndon spoke out\nfor the angry 'new men', and\nRoberts addressed herself to the\nfeminist faithful, and there was\nhardly any ground in between.\nLyndon rounded on 'mad\nfeminists', and Roberts rounded on\nLyndon. Melvyn Bragg had on a pair of bifocals and sitting directly\n...Melvyn Bragg\nhad on a pair of\nbifocals...\nopposite me with a disconcerting ly disgusted look on his face,\ncontrived to look like Paddington's irate neighbour Mr Curry.\nEveybody seemed intellectually\nangry about whatever they had\ncome to be angry about. Lyndon's primary anguish was that men are\nunable to stay in contact with their\nchildren post-divorce or break-up,\ndon't get custody and are forced by\nthe courts to pay maintenance. This\nis unquestionably anguish which he\nhimself feels, since he lost contact\nwith his six-year-old son, after his\nmarriage broke down, at the time\nof writing NM SW. He didn't help\nhimself though by claiming to know\nthat many women who say they\nhave been raped, are actually lying,\nand that still many others use\nabortion as a cosmetic\ncontraceptive. Roberts, in going a way to correct him on these matters,\ndidn't give any real indication that\nhis anguish was of much note. For\nme, little transpired from the\nevening except how utterly and\npara ly singly vulnerable people are,\nand how short a step it is between\npain and anger. It's nothing at all\nto express anger in whatever\nmanner comes to hand, it's easy and\npredictable, and sad.\nIn 1990 in the Sunday Times,\nNeil Lyndon wrote:\n'Something ruinous and evil has\nhappened between men and women\nin the last 25 years. Something so\nwounding and painful and sore, that\nit is hard to see how the last\ngenerations of this century can\ncome of age, un afflicted by the ills\nof the past.'\n'Something so wounding and\npainful and sore' is not a voice we\ncan afford to ignore, no matter from\nwhom it comes. If the sixties\ngeneration which promised so much\nin the way of hope, has emerged so\nembittered, then, unless we listen\nwith some sympathy and humanity,\nthen sadly, we too are doomed.\nNeil Lyndon's book provoked a huge outcry, acting as a call to arms for\nmany a closet feminist sympathiser. Shown above is 'Mad about Women'\nby Yvonne Roberts, one of the books produced as a response to No More\nSex War.\nwomen. Currently, there are around\nsixty, and they don't all have\nbabies.\nLyndon uses the cute device of\nsimply not including an appendix in\nhis book, to offset queries about the\nstatistics he has chosen to quote.\nIt would be easy, and very\ntempting, simply to dismiss 'No\nMore Sex War'. If that were all\nthere was to say, I should hardly be\nwasting my time or yours.\nHowever, when his book was\npublished, Neil Lydon was\npropelled into a fur ore of publicity,\nand was attacked by columnists in\nsuccessive features in The Sunday\nTimes, The Times (who ran five\nfeatures on it in the space of a week), The Daily Telegraph, The\nEvening Standard, The Guardian\nand The Independent. Lyndon was\ninterviewed on daytime TV slots,\nappeared on Start the Week, with\nMelvyn Bragg, was interviewed by\nAndrew Neil, Editor of the Sunday\nTimes, and became the subject of\nnumerous other fallout articles. The\nabout his views, or came out either\nin support, or against him, prefer ing instead to limit the discussion to\nLyndon's reaction to the media\ncoverage given to ' NM SW'. Lyndon said he had been\nvictimised, and that none of his\narguments had been answered by\nany of the 'harridans' who had\nreviewed it. Most responses, it\nseemed, had comprised in part of\nasking him if he had a 'problem'\nwith women. It would have been\ntempting to say, 'Well Neil, what\ndid you expect?', but none of the\nboys did. The Times and Dillons\norganised a debate, 'Has Feminism\nFailed?', to promote the book.\nMore than 900 people paid \u00a3 1 0 to\nattend.\nNeil Lyndon and professor\nKenneth Minogue (LSE) spoke for\nthe motion, Yvonne Roberts and\nBeatrix Campbell spoke against,\nand Melvyn Bragg chaired.\nLots of people spoke at length,\nboth nothing much was actually\nsaid.

They\nplay brilliantly, and go down\nsurprisingly well with Joe Public\n(who is definitely not a Camden\nUnderworld mosher tonight).\nSadly, their playing well is neither\nhere not there, as their appearance\nis nothing more than a vain political\nstatement and an extension of The\nSouth's increasingly pretentious\nattempts to reach 'right on-ness' at\ntheir predominantly middle-class\naudience.\nWhile The Beautiful South are a good band, they aren't exciting.\nShonen Knife/BMX\nBandits-ULU 26.11.92\nWhen we walked in, the BMX\nBandits were already playing; 'too\nstudent y' commented my sweet and\ncharming companion, too right-but I liked them.\nShonen Knife were fuckin'\nmarvellous, the band name actually\nmeans youth knife, and whether\nthey're a conceptual novelty band\nor not, I don't care, I luv 'em down\nto the ground. They're so\naesthetically na ff, you just can't hate them. Even with corny one\nliners like 'we lub U' are delivered\nin such an unassuming,\nun pre n ten tio us manner they create\narches that flex through your entire\nsystem (yes, I'm serious!). 'IAm A Cat' probably comes from an\nacclaimed Jap book by Soseki\nNatsume called 'Wagahai wa neko\nde aru'\u2014an anthropomorphic satire\nseen through feline eyes; it's basically brilliant. 'Space\nChristmas' and 'Bear Up Bison'\nwent down a treat, and the new\nnew album (apart from two old\nsongs which were revamped to\nsound like they were from the new\nalbum)! Not to be too bitchy, the\nnew material is pretty good, but\nthen again, once you've heard one\nsong you can put your CD player\non repeat and you're not going to\nnotice any difference.\nThere was one thing, however,\nthat they've kept from their\ntraditional gigs, and that's sounding\nlike an almost perfect reproduction\nof the album. Nice backdrop and\nlight show though.\nLily, Minnie & Viola.\nAmong the very 'toe tapping'\nsingles like 'Pencil Case', 'Red\nEyes' and 'We Are Each Other'.\nI'm left looking around the Arena,\nand think abut my paras it ology essay. The Housemartins' sound\ncomes back to lift the proceedings\nfrom time to time, this and some\ninspired singing from the now fat\nand shaven headed Heaton,\nconspire to drag the set out form the\ngaping jaws of mediocrity.\nHaving said that, it was a very\nenjoyable gig, not really my scene,\nbut this being their first 'big'\nLondon venue ever, and technical\nproblems like the backdrop\nplummeting to the ground halfway\nthrough can't have helped them\nvery much either.\nIn the end temptation overcame\nme, and I asked:\n'What did you reckon then Bob?'.\n'Smart.' said Bob.\nCan't say fairer than that can\nyou?\nGlyph McCord.\npsychedelic 'Brown Mushroom'\nwas absolutely mind blowing. No\nPluto references, but 'Riding the\nRocket' sped past my sense of\nreality and balance; in fact the dude,\nPoddy can probably emp a this e with\nme too (em path a logical i ties \u2014\nPoddy).\nIt's so great to see Jap women\nbreaking out of the stereotype of the\nconformist society and doing their\nthing. In fact 'Baggs' on the 'Pretty\nLittle Baka Guy' is great satire\ntaking the piss out of most women\nin the land of the rising Yen (er,\nsorry\u2014sun) who all carry Luis\nVuitton bags thinking they have\nclass. (Na-h, dream on).\nSheer attitude without p retention, sheer aesthetics without over-indulgence. All I can say is I'm in\nlu ur r ve. Lucas.\n\u2022 'Let's Knife', out now on\nAugust Creation. BMX Bandits\n'Serious Drugs' out now on\nCreation.\nUnsane, Surgery\u2014Camden\nUnderworld 24.11.92\nAh, the great injustices of life\u2014\nUnsane supporting Surgery, for\nexample. I mean, come on, anyone\nin the know surely knows that\nUnsane is the best thing to come out\nof New York since the Guardian\nAngels (erm...) and don't deserve\nto be support to anyone, let alone\nSurgery. But hey, life's like that\nsometimes, I guess.\nOkay, so the Underworld isn't such a great venue, what with the\npillars all over the place and the\nreally atrocious sound (which\nadmittedly did get better) and the\nlow stage, and considering that this\nwas Unsane's first gig with new\ndrummer Vincent Signorelli they\nsounded pretty good. I laughed\nwhen they tuned their guitars, tho',\nbecause these guys were LOUD \u2014\nfeedback howling hither and thither\nand they hardly stopped for breath\nthe whole time so the set was just\nnoise noise noise, and hey, that's what us kids want, right? Ear\ndestroying ly good fun.\nSurgery confounded all my pre-gig expectations totally by being\npretty good as well. I shoulda'\nknown they'd be okay tho', seeing\nas they're on the ultra-hip-and-cool\nAmphetamine Reptile record label\n(ooo ops... gratuitous mention of\nseminal underground label there,\nsorry; God, I'm just so 'with it'\nsometimes!).\nUh..that's it.\nJ Andelin.\nIckle girls w iv big knife\nRobert Palmer\u2014Royal\nAlbert Hall\nWhat happened to Robert Palmer?\nI remember Robert Palmer, as do\nmost people, for rock classics such\nas 'Addicted to Love' and 'Simply\nir resist able'. I went to the Royal\nAlbert Hall on Wednesday evening\nexpecting to hear those and more of\nhis many hits.\nI was certainly surprised.\nRobert Palmer was to be\naccompanied by the BBC Radio 2\nOrchestra, which was a little\nstrange but I thought nothing of it.\nThe orchestra came on and\nplayed something that my gran\nwould appreciate. Then the man\nhimself came on. He sang a couple\nof songs from the 1920s era. It\nbecame apparent, from what he said\nbetween the songs, that he intended\nto carry on this big-band, swing sort\nof music for the rest of the concert.\nFrom that moment on there was\na constant stream of dissatisfied fans\nwalking out!\nI decided to stick it out, just in\ncase it got any better. About half\nway through Carrie Wilson, of\nWilson Phillips fame, joined Rob\non stage, loo ing particularly\noverweight. They sang a couple of\nduets (in the same style) and then\ntogether they did 'Every Kind of\nPeople'. This went down very well\n(the audience could be heard to\ncheer as opposed to just clapping).\nThe hint wasn't taken and it was\nback to the first half of the century.\nBy the end of the concert about a quarter of the audience had\ndeparted.\nAs an encore he actually sang\n'She Makes My Day' (the highlight\nof the evening) then with Carrie the\nNat King Cole classic 'Have\nYourself a Merry Little Christmas'.\nThese were well received.\nHe then came back for another\nencore but he repeated a number\nfrom earlier. At the end of that\neveryone just got up and left.\nMost people went home, like me;\nfeeling deceived and disappointed.\nHelen Randall.\n\u2022 Who are you, Helen?\nNo Parking. Ke where.

Five teams\nand a total of forty collectors braved\nthe freezing cold to shake their cans\nand strut their stuff in aid of Shelter,\na charity for homeless people and\nthose in inadequate housing (no,that\ndoesn't include Halls of\nResidence!). Although the turnout\nwas a little lower than we'd hoped\nfor, morale was high and everybody\nentered into the spirit of the event.\nThe challenge, for those of you\nwho didn't read last week's article,\nwas to visit nine specified locations\nin as short a time as possible,\ncollecting money and accruing\npoints by completing physical\nchallenges, trivia questions and on\nthe spot scavenges. Extra points\nwere also available by bribing the\nmarshals with suitable liquid\nGrand Tour\nrefreshment (I believe coffee was\nactually the most requested bribe!).\nThe locations were all popular\ntourist sights, as you may have\nguessed by now, and included\nplaces like Sadlers Wells, Covent\nGarden and Camden Lock so the\nteams got to see all the things they'd been too busy doing RAG to see\nbefore.\nA big thanks to all the marshals,\nmost of whom stayed out in the cold\nfor the greater part of the day -except for brief forays in search of\nwarmth.

Apologies for absence come\nfrom Tom Robson, who was in jail.\nThe defence, eager to attack, had\nmany shots on goal, culminating in\nthe long range goal from two yards\nby Annan Galloway.\nThe midfield, sponsored by\nAraldite, ran all over the place for\nno apparent reason, although Rafael\nMartinez scored a hat-trick in the\nlast game, so that's alright. Also\nThe Dribblers started well, but team\nmorale dropped sharply after a foal\nfrom Chrstie in the fourth minute\nwas disallowed due to a player who\nshall remain nameless being offside.\nCaptain Eleanor was once again\nabsent, does she know something\nwe don't? Although at least this\ntime we had a full team\u2014\neventually. Kings dominated much\nof the game, although the Dribblers\ndid manage to get a few shots on\nIC Netball\nImperial College Union Netball\nClub may not be the largest of\nclubs, but we make up for the lack\nof members by excellent results.\nWe may only be a club consisting\nof eight female members, but that\ndoesn't mean our team is of a low\nstandard.\nI think this year, we have proved\nourselves to not only to be one of\nthe best female sports teams at IC,\nbut also we are doing much better\nthan many of the large male sports\nclubs.\nAfter coming second in the first\nround of the U AU tournament, after\nReading, we are through to the next\nround in January. This achievement\nshows that the IC Netball team this\nyear, has got further and done much\nbetter than the team in previous\nyears.\nIn addition to this, we are\ncurrently at the top of our division\nin the UL U Netball League and we\nhope to set a record for IC here too\nin the tournament next year.\nThe scores recently have included\nvictories against UCL, Royal\nHospital and London and Royal\nHolloway and Bedford: 49-3, 44-12\nand 31-26 respectively.\nSo come on IC, why not give us\na bit more recognition?\nRuben scored in another game.\nThe second goal was actually the\nfirst, and was John Mottashed's seventh, who 'is' keenly supported\nby ladies hockey.\nOther notable incidents in\nmidfield were Stuart Watson\nwinning a header, Richie Dixon\npassing the ball square, and Tellis\n'lou gan is' Botzios playing in\nposition.\nAlthough scrappy i.e. made the\ngame safe with a beautiful corner\nfrom hat-trick hero Rafael turned in\non the volley by Annan 'offside'\nGalloway.\nIC are now through the U AU, as\nthe quarter finals of the UL Cup,\nand on top of the league, but\nunfortunately not on top of ladies\nhockey.\ngoal but the net remained elusive.\nHad the Dribblers kept their spirits\nup, had the pitch been drier and had\nthe referee not allowed Kings to\ntake their foul throws again (?) the\nfinal score may have been very\ndifferent.\nAs usual the Dribblers were\nvictorious in the boat race, splitting\ninto two teams of four and racing\neach other as Kings were too weak\nand feeble to take part.\nWobblers\nWe had prepared for the game with\nhours of practice. Our short corner\nroutine was bound to devastate\nopposing defences. Like Heinz, but\nbetter, we had 400 variations of\ntomato-sauced, goal-mouth\nstimulation.\nThe game started with a single St\nBart's attack followed by 20\nminutes of Imperial 'total hockey',\nincluding all the 400 above\nflavours. Of course we didn't score\nfrom any of these. At least Dave\nFairhurst managed to stop his slips\nthis time. As for Steve Lam, he had\nenough time to give birth to an\nelephant before missing several\ntimes. Thankfully our open play\ncame to the rescue. Like St George\nastride a majestic charger, Steve\nrede a med himself with a bumbling\ndrive over the keeper. Thus spurred\non to higher things we rammed\nanother three home, courtesy of\nJohn Furlong, Dave F and Steve\n(again).\nThe second half quickly followed\nbut was a grey affair, livened only\nbe encores from Dave and John.\nThe only other event of note was\nJohn's own goal. Determined to\nderail Simon the goalie's clean\nsheet, he carefully redirected a wayward shot into our goal.,\nAfter initial confusion - when we\nfound ourselves without any second\nrow - and a swift position change\nround, IC seconds started a hard,\nbut enjoyable game in the driving\nseat. Most of the possession was\nIC's, increasing as the police got\nmore tired. The first try came from\ngood dodging and pace y running\nfrom Fly-half Adam Wood.\nUnfortunately, the wind was against\nus in the first half blowing the kick\nback towards us. Rucking and\nmauling wasn't as clean as it could\nhave been, but Mark Ashford and\nTom Upsdell slowed down their\nbacks well, enabling the back row\nto get in position again. The second\nImperial College 5 Goldsmiths 10\nSunday 29th December\nAfter only six weeks of training,\nthe I.C. Virgins were thrust onto the\npitch for their first game. Despite\ninexperience, our girls put up a superb performance, with the\nforwards demonstrating their newly\nacquired sc rummaging skills. The\n'Goldies' few more capable players,\nhowever, quickly took advantage of\nour initial weaknesses and scored a try. Their lack of practice showed\nthrough at their poor attempt at a conversion, with the ball hardly\nleaving the ground. Our player of\nthe Match, Permi, brought her\nfootball training into practice and,\nafter a storming sprint up the wing,\nscored a try and almost made the\nImperial achieved excellent results\nat the British Indoor Rowing\nChampionships last Sunday.

The flanker s, John\nCassidy and John (Break right,\nBreak right - The're going right!!)\nRoebuck, once again had a superb\ngame.

The second half saw another\ntry by the opposition and an injury\non each side, and the shortened\ngame left our girls wanting more.\nI.C. gave a better demonstration\nof their abilities in the bar\nafterwards, out-drinking and\ndefinitely out-singing Goldsmiths.\nOur thanks must go to all the people\nwho came out to Sidcup to support\nus and especially to Leon Orr and\nDave Bolton for their tireless\ntraining.

Evacuation of the\nbuilding was initially prevented at\nthe east staircase exit as the\nmagnetically locked doors into the\nQuad failed to open automatically.\nUnion Stewards immediately called\nthe Beit Quad security guards who\nopened the door manually enabling\nevacuation to be completed, though\nin a longer time than I would\nconsider satisfactory with regard to\nthe safety of those in the building.\nObviously, in the event of a real\nfire, such a delay could have\nextremely serious consequences.\nThe malfunction was due to a fault\nat the interface between the existing\nfire alarm system, and the\n'ma glock' system which was\ninstalled over the summer vacation.\nThis fault has now been rectified,\nand we have arranged for a special\nweekly test of the entire Union\nbuilding alarm system, to take place\nbefore the 'Atmosphere' event each\nFriday. The only time the\n'ma glock' doors are closed while\nthe building is in use is during an\nevent.\nA further problem highlighted on\nFriday night was the fact that alarm\nbells are not audible in some parts\nof the Union building, notably the\nTraditional Bar when busy. College\nfire officers were already aware of\nthis problem, and had placed an\norder for a new power supply unit\ndesigned to boost the power to all\nbells and hence make them louder.\nIronically this power supply unit\nwas delivered last Thursday!\nCollege authorities have taken the\nincident very seriously, and rather\nthan attempting to find a scapegoat\nto 'hang from the yard-arm' are\nmore concerned with bringing the\nUnion fire alarm system up to\nscratch. I have been assured that the\nnew power supply unit will be\ninstalled as soon as possible.\nRick Bilby\nDeputy President\nare ers Info\nThere are two Careers Talks this\ncoming week at 1.00-1.50pm: Tuesday 8th December: 'The\nCivil Service' by Mr Micahel\nHerron of the DTI\u2014in LT213\nHuxley\u2014Clore Lecture Theatre.\nThursday 10th December:\n'Environmental Careers' by\nProfessor Nigel Bell of ICCET\u2014\nin LT213 Huxley\u2014Clore Lecture\nTheatre.\nAll undergraduates and\npostgraduates are welcome to\nattend.

The College\nJ CR Reply Dear Editor,\nAn unfortunate incident took\nplace in the JCR on 18th November\nduring the Overseas Week, where\nthe Turkish Society stand was\nattacked by a violent crowd\ndemanding the removal of a tourist\nposter from the display board. As\nthe poster did not have any political\ncontent and a direct insult to any\ngroup or individual, we, the\nTurkish Society members, think\nthat it was wrong to accept their\ndemand and remove the poster.\nWe think that, there must be\n\u2022 some principles and regulations\nruling the activities of the societies\nwithin the ICU, and every society\nshould stand up to protect these\nprinciples. By trying to stand up\nagainst those hooligans that day in\nthe JCR, we think the Turkish\nSociety has played its role in\nprotecting these principles. When\nthe ICU Officers Rick Bilby and\nDominic Wilkinson arrived at the\nTurkish Society stall they stated that\nthey did not find the poster in\nquestion offensive either.\nUnfortunately, after having spoken\nto that violent crowd Mr Wilkinson\nseemed to realise that it was easier\nto ask the Turkish Society to\nremove the poster than to free the\nadministration are aware of their\nlegal responsibilities under the 1990\nFood Safety Act, and do not wish\nto permit events to take place which\ncould potentially put at risk the\nhealth of guests attending functions\nand at the same time render the\nCollege authorities liable for\nprosecution.\nThe Act specifies the need for\nfood handlers to be trained, for\nhand washing facilities to be\navailable, and for strict adherence\nand monitoring of temperature\ncontrols of food in transportation,\nstorage and display.\nThe concern to College is where\nhosts of events for large numbers\nproduce food at home, where there\nis inadequate ref ridge ration for that\namount, transport it in to College,\nwithout proper chilling and heating\nfacilities, hold it in College in an\ninappropriate environment and then\noffer it for sale.\nSocieties wishing to host events\nare welcome to use College catering\nor, if using an external supplier,\nmust comply with a checklist of\nrequirements and give six weeks\nnotice.\nDetails are available from the\nUnion Manager, Mandy Hurford,\nand Catering Operations Manager,\nDavid Smith.\nYours sincerely,\nSimon Westerman.\nroom from that aggressive group of\npeople to maintain order in the JCR.\nFrom that point, we think the\nTurkish Society and the Overseas\nStudents Committee (OSC) have a right to demand an apology from\nthe ICU for not being strong enough\nto maintain a peaceful atmosphere\nin the JCR for the Overseas\nSocieties to carry on with their\nactivities within the Overseas\nWeek. That apology should also be\ndemanded from the ICU for trying\nto impose on an Overseas Students\nSociety the decision of a group of\nhooligans on which posters can or\ncannot be displayed.\nWe also think that every student\nin this college should be able to\ndisplay a poster from his/her home\ntown regardless of whether or not\nhis/her country has been recognised\nby the United Nations. And we\nthink that he/she should be able to\ndo this within a society that he/she\nfeels comfortable with.\nWe also strongly believe that the\nwhole body of OSC should act in\nharmony by condemning the action\nof the crowd of hooligans in the\nJCR on 18th November, resulting\nin the closure of the JCR.\nOn behalf of the Turkish Society,\nSener Sezgin.\nSpeaking Out\nDear Jonty,\nAnonymity is a recurrent w hinge of the Rector.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 Li ii1i l Issue 951 4 December 1992\nAlarm Failure Chair's Birthday\nby Declan Curry\nRepairs to the fire alarm system in\nthe Union Building have been made\nfollowing a fire alert in the early\nhours of last Saturday morning.\nDuring the alert, it was found that\nmagnetically locked 'mag locked' fire escape doors stayed shut. These\ndoors are supposed to open\nautomatically when Beit Quad fire\nalarms sound.\nThe door lock failure is being\nblamed on a drop in voltage across\nthe relays in the locks. Fire\ncontractors ASF replaced the relays\nin the system on Monday of this\nweek, and Mr Rick Bilby, Union\nDeputy President, says that the\ndoors 'are now working'. Mr Bilby\ndescribed the door lock failure as\n'seriously worrying.'\nThe drama began at three minutes\npast one last Saturday morning,\nwhen a fire glass outside the Union\nBar was broken. The fire control\npanel in the Beit Quad security\nlodge indicated a fire in the Union\nBuilding, and College and Union\nsecurity began an immediate\nevacuation. Beit Quad Hall of\nResidence was also evacuated.\nWithin less than a minute, Union\nstewards found that the emergency\nexits outside the Felix office and\noutside the Traditional Bar were\nstill locked. College security were\ninformed, and were asked to open\nthe doors with a key. While waiting\nfor College security to arrive\nthrough the packed Da Vinci's Bar,\nstewards attempted to force open\nthe door outside the Bar.\nOther Union stewards and Bar\nstaff meanwhile evacuated Da\nVinci's and the Traditional bar.\nCustomers report that the alarm in\nDa Vinci's was 'barely audible',\nwhile bar staff in the Traditional Bar\nwere only aware of a fire alert after\nbeing informed by other staff, as the\nTraditional Bar alarm did not\nsound. Customers complained\nafterwards that the lights in the\nTraditional Bar were abruptly\nextinguished, causing mild panic.\nEnts stewards evacuated the Ents\nlounge, while Union stewards\nchecked all floors of the Union\nbuilding above the ground floor.\nFire evacuation routes on upper\nfloors were created by unlocking\nthe table tennis and snooker rooms,\nand the concert hall. Students left\nthe Union building by the central\ndoors on the ground floor, with Bar\ncustomers being evacuated past the\ncatering area, a possible fire zone.\nThe snack bar, along with Da\nVinci's and the Traditional Bars,\nhad ceased trading before the alert\nbegan. Over 600 people were in the\nUnion building at the time of the\nalert.\nCollege security opened the\nmagnetically locked fire escapes\nfive minutes after the alarms\nsounded, easing congestion at the\nmain central doors. Concern has\nbeen expressed over the crush of\npeople which developed near to\nthese ground floor doors. In an\narticle in this morning's Felix, Mr Bilby writes that the evacuation was\ncompleted 'in a longer time than I would consider satisfactory',\nadding that 'in the event of a real\nfire, such a delay could have\nextremely serious consequences'.\nOn IC Radio last Monday, he said\nthat the crush at the doors meant 'it\ntook fifteen minutes to evacuate the\nbuilding, when ideally one would\nhave it evacuated in about five'. A full check of the building had been\nmade after seven minutes, and the\nbuilding was fully evacuated\nthirteen minutes after the alert\nbegan. Alarms were finally\nSir Frank Cooper, chairman of Imperial College's Governing Body,\ncelebrated his 70th birthday on Wednesday 2nd December.

The magnetically\nlocked doors outside the Felix office\nand outside the Traditional Bar\nwere not opened until five minutes\nafter the start of the evacuation. It\nis unclear if the fourth exit, on the\nfirst floor, was open during the\nalert. Leading onto Bremner Road,\nin front of the Albert Hall, this exit\nconsists of a 'push-bar' inner door\nand a magnetically locked outer\ndoor. Mr Bilby said 'no-one is sure\nwhether it opened or not. I probably\nthink that it did'.\nCustomers have also complained\nabout the slippery nature of the\nfloor of the Union lobby in front of\nthe central doors, and of the stairs\nfrom the lobby to the first floor.\nSome students told Felix that people\nslipped and fell to the floor during\nthe evacuation, and that a fight\ndeveloped in the lobby. Felix has\nalso been told that some fire\nextinguishers were not working,\nand that stewards did not appear to\nhave adequate fire training. Some\nstudents have also commented on\nthe possibility of windows in the\nEnts Lounge and Da Vinci's Bar\nbeing modified to become fire exits.\n3/4 8 1 0 / 1 1 1 4 / 1 7\nOpinion Viz Sex Reviews\nPages Videos War Round-up\n\n"

There are\nmisfits and outcasts, people who\ncannot live with rules and\nregulations. There are some who\nproudly call this place 'home'.\nWe don't wave our magic wand\nand solve everyone's problems. We\ngive immediate relief. We meet at\nWeek's Hall at 9.00pm every\nThursday, and return to Southside\naround closing time. Please come\nand help us to help them.\nIf you want any more\ninformation, please contact Andrew\nMelling, Geology UG(0717362685); lames Kew, Physics PG;\nAlan lames, Physics PG; Dan\nKitcher, Physics UG. Dan Kitchner, Physics 2.\nWhat you do and why you do it\nBeing at university, we see all\naround us lots of different people\ndoing lots of different things. Some\nhave their heads down, working all\nhours of the day. Others are the\nopposite, partying every night.\nOthers still spend time doing sports\nand making their bodies beautiful.\nAnd others still, are active in\n'changing the world' type\norganisations. And then there's your average student who perhaps\ndoes a mix of all these things.\nHave you noticed some common\nlink between all these people as to\nwhy they do what they do?\nEveryone is trying to achieve\nhappiness, satisfaction and\ncontentment. Whether it be the\nintellectual challenge of a really\ntough problem sheet, or having a good laugh with the lads at the bar\nor the satisfaction of doing\nsomething with one's life by\ncampaigning against world poverty;\nthey're all done for the same\nreasons\u2014essentially to feel good\nwithin oneself.\nLife is all about that. Whether we\ndo an action or not depends on its\ndefinite or probable outcome. The\nmore beneficial the li k ley outcome,\nthe more we are likely to sacrifice\nin order to achieve it. After all that's mainly why most of us are here\nspending years on our various\ncourses. We hope to get a decent\njob and serve humanity, and thus\nlive as happy a life as possible. It's natural to want to be happy and\ncontented and avoid misery and\ndissatisfaction.\nIf some benevolent, trustworthy\nsort said to you, 'hop on your left\nleg for one minute, and I 'll give you\na million pounds', the chances are\nthat you'd do it. If he said the same,\npromising to give you that million\npounds next year, you'd still\npossibly do it. Looking silly for a minute would, in this case, be worth\nit.\nNow, if some raving maniac was\nto point a gun at you and said 'jump\nor I 'll blow your head off, you\nwould definitely do as he says. If\nhe were to say the same, except he\npromised to kill you next year, you\nwould still do as he said, if you\nthought that he could definitely find\nyou in a year's time.\nNow consider this. If someone\n(who you knew was capable of\nabsolutely anything) said to you,\n'Do this and that for seventy years\nand then I 'll give you all that you\ncan ever think of wanting', would\nyou not do as he says? Forget the\nmillion pounds and think of this\npossible reward. Now if that same\nperson was to say, 'Live a different\nway of life for seventy years and I 'll\nmake you burn in fire forever',\nwould you then not agree to what\nhe says? Forget the gun and think\nof this possible outcome.\nBut the thing is, that someone is\ntelling us this. That is, the\nCreator\u2014the one who created me,\nyou, the tree, the sun and\neverything else in existence. And\nthis Creator is more than capable of\nfulfilling his promises. The least\nreward for living as he asks us to\ndo, is anything we like\u2014and then\nmore on top of that\u2014i.e. we can't imagine the reward. And the least\npunishment he promises for living\ndifferently is fire at our feet that will\nmake our brains boil.\nBut hang on! Where is all this\ncoming from? All this comes from\na book that claims to be the word\nof the Creator. But this book has no\nmerit if there's no Creator in the\nfirst place.\nAs muslims, we invite anyone to\ndiscuss with us our claims that there\nis a Creator and that the Quran is\nthe Creator's authentic word.\nToday is the final day of Imperial\nCollege's Islamic Society's Islamic\nWeek. The topic is Judgement Day.\nI spent the first few paragraphs\ndiscussing why people try to do\nwhat they do. This final talk aims\nto explain why muslims try to\nfollow the lifestyle prescribed by\nthe Creator. We invite you to come\nand find out about this reality of\nJudgement Day. Then afterwards\nyou can discuss the issues of\nwhether the Quran and the existence\nof the Creator is true. After all, if\nthese aren't true, then everything\nelse, be it Judgement Day, Paradise\nor Fire, are nothing more than\nfairytales, myths or superstitions.\nCome and find out about these,\nthe most important of issues. You\nmay think that the chances of all this\nbeing true, is small\u2014but you have\nto admit that the stakes are high.\nDon't let ignorance strip you\nfrom doing the right thing.\n'You denied My Revelations'\nalthough you knew nothing of them.\nWhat was it that you were doing ?'\nQuran 27:84.\n'Judgement Day': Fri4th December, 6pm, Mech Eng 220.\nZaeem Sivardeen, Civ Eng 2.\nPage 13\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews4 December 1992 Felix 951\nDeath Becomes Her\nImagine Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis\nand Goldie Hawn as you've never\nseen them before, now imagine\nMeryl Streep, Bruce Willis and\nGoldie Hawn as you've NEVER seen them before. Cue twilight zone\ntheme, do do do do, do do do do,\n... okay you try writing it down,\nalright just think shock-horror-deep-breaths, and you'll be on the\nright track. This film is weird with\na capital strange, not quite in the\nTwin Peaks league but defy\ncategory, it does.\nProduced by Robert\u2014Back to the\nFuture\u2014Zemckis this black (?)\ncomedy (??) blends that too-often-dusted-down contemporary tale of\nlust, envy, murder and the search\nfor everlasting youth, with some\nboxer-short wet tingly good acting,\nand some absolutely pant-soil ingly spiff ing special effects. Well,\nThe Frieze of Life\u2014Edvard\nMunch\u2014National Gallery\nEdvard Munch (1863-1944) is\nNorway's most celebrated artist.\nThis major exhibition, first staged\nin Berlin in 1893, consists of three\nmajor themes: 'love', 'anxiety' and\n'death'. A fourth, 'The Green\nRoom' was added later.\nEven if strictly a rainy day gallery\nvisitor, you've probably\nencountered Munch's work, albi et unc on cio us ly. For instance London\nUnderground pay homage to 'The\nScream' in their current fare\nevasion campaign. A man sit's rigid, his reflection, one of pure\nterror. Munch had more than the\ntransport police in mind though,\n'The Scream' famously depicts 'a scream passing through nature...I painted this picture, painted the sky\nas actual blood. The colour\nshrieked.'\nIf you have ever caught your own\nreflection on the tube window\nopposite, subtly refracted and\ndrained of colour, suddenly\nappearing that of a lonely stranger,\nMunch's work is like that, peopled\nby faces simple, strong and thus\nmore powerful, landscapes\nrendered in form rather than\ndistracting detail.\n'Death Becomes Her.\nThe first series begins with love's dreamlike conception, moving\nthrough its con sum ation to the\ndespair and betrayal Munch sees as\nthe inevitable ending. The two\nconnected, indistinguishable loves\nof 'The Kiss' contrast with 'The\nVampire', where woman is\nportrayed as predator, 'a parasite on\nspiritual existence'.\nSuch happy thoughts are quickly\nforgotten as we enter 'Anxiety'.\nFaces have become taut white\nmasks, the world a mad curtain of\nswirling blues and reds. Alienation\nand death loom large\u2014'pale\ncorpses.. .a twisted road\u2014at the end\nof which was the grave'.\n'Puberty' showed his sister\nSophie naked and scared, in the\n'Death' room she's faded, serene\nand doomed at fifteen to die. In\n'The Dead Mother and Child' she\nglares out, echoing \"The Scream' as\nher mother lies still behind.\nPointing 'The Green Room'\nMunch was recovering from total\nnervous collapse. The lunatic spirit\nlingers on through in these savage\nscenes set in a claustrophobic\nGerman brothel. So, a madman, but\nthe strength of this exhibition is:\nhowever hard we try to distract\nourselves we'll all follow this cycle\nof love and loss, conception and\ndeg red ation. Give it a try but avoid\ntaking the tube home.\nOwain.\n\u2022 National Gallery, Trafalgar\nSquare, WC1, Charing Cross tube.\nTickets \u00a32 cones.\nConcert\nYuri Bashmet\u2014Viola\nFrom Brahms to Britten, Marais to\nFaure, Yuri Bashmet is the\ncons u mate musician\u2014a magician.\nBeginning with Marais' suit in Dminor, Bashmet eased a viol-like\nspareness of tone and dynamic\nrange from his fiendishly difficult\ninstrument, highlighting its fuga l, baroque simplicity. Next, the lyric\nwarmth and energy of Brahms'\nsonatas Op 120 Nos. 1 and 2,\nanother result of the composer's love of the alto voice, came fully\nalive with every caress of the bow.\nHe coaxes a raw, breathy cello tone\nin comp temp lat ive adagio passages\ncontrasting with the sprig hd y agility\nand soaring beauty of a violin in\nAllegro sections. Accompanist\nMikhail Mantial, struggling with\nthe sledge-hammer dynamic\nsubtlety of the incumbent Steinway\nwas the only flaw here.\nIt seemed as though all\npossibilities of timbre, ingenuity\nand tonal beauty had been\nexhausted; then came Britten's Lachrymae. Bashmet racked sighs\nand sobs from his viola in a heavenly lament. To describe his\nencore, a Faure, would be 'like\ntaking a spade to a souffl6...' Sara.\n\u2022 Barbican Centre, Silk Street,\nEC2. Celebrity recital series\ncontinues.\nenough of the below waist humour,\nthe plot in a nutshell; 'Girl' going\nout with 'Boy' takes her to meet\n'Friend', seven years pass 'Friend'\nnow married to 'Boy', 'Girl'\ninsanely upset puts on 200 pounds,\nplots revenge, 'Friend' afraid of\ngetting old seeks elixir of life; 'Girl'\ncomes back to kill 'Friend', but\nboth now immortal, 'Boy' VERY confused, (\u2014do you blame him?)\nand so on, I won't spoil it for you.\nDo try to see this film, it's very\nfunny in places, and the famous\nthree work very well together, the\nspecial effects are amazing, not only\nthe computer 'which way did I put\nmy head on this morning?'\ngraphics, but also the make-up, or\nshould that be 'make me fat, old,\nsexy'. It starts too slowly, has a great ending, and has no middle-just like Goldie Hawn.\nA good film, not excellent, most\ncertainly not crap, above middling,\numm m,e rrr, see what you think.\nOh, and keep an eye out for Elvis.\nMario.\n\u2022 Opens hither and thither today.\nSibelius, Symphonies\n3 and 1\nIn the opening concert of their\ncomplete symphony cycle at the\nBarbican, it was the least Sibeliuslike part of the programme which'\ndrew the best from Sir Colin Davis\nand the LSO. The finale of the First\nSymphony is pure Tchaikovsky,\nand can sometimes sound\nunconvincing, but here it emerged\nglossy and powerful as a thoroughbred racehorse. In\ncontrast, the tone-poem Luonnatar\nof 14 years later shows Sibelius at\nthe height of his powers; it too\nreceived a dramatic, full-blooded\nperformance, with Karita Mattila a wholehearted soloist.\nDavis's approach was less\nsuccessful in the outer movements\nof the Third Symphony. Altogether\na more lithe and sinuous work than\nthe First, it makes its impact not\nthrough the strength of its\nfortissimo s but through a build-up\nof inner tension which requires\nclean, open textures to make itself\nfully felt. If I dare to suggest that\nthis could have been better achieved\nby reducing the number of strings,\nand being less ready to allow the\nLSO brass to have their head to a sometimes unnerving extent. In the\ncentral slow movement though, one\ncould not have wished for more\nbeautiful playing.\nPatrick Wood.\n\u2022 The Davis/LSO Sibelius cycle\ncontinues at the Barbican, Silk\nStreet, EC2, Barbican/Moorgate\ntube.

    "content": "opinion\nEditorial\nReligion\nReligion is the politics of insecurity.\nWe doubt, religion answers, we\nwaver, religion is firm, we are\ninsecure and religion is solidity.\nPosters and information which\nshock personal insecurities are put\nout by religious groups, to attract\nus to the church, and satisfy our\nunanswered questions. How then\n:an a religion be anything else but\nfatally flawed? If membership of\nin y religion is brought about by a j res s gang of our own doubts how\n;an it answer the questions we beg\nanswers for?\nThis week was Islamic Week. It\nreleased propaganda as described\nabove, and played merry hell with\nthe emotions of anyone who was not\na Muslim. I have no personal\ndisagreement with Islam, because\nevery religion on the planet\nperforms exactly the same tricks.\nReligions are built on insecurity\nand nurture neurosis. How have\nthey survived for so long? Easy.\nHow many wars, murders, and\nrevolutions, have been caused by\ngroups of believers? Sikhs,\nMuslims, Hindu, Protestants,\nCatholics, Jews and even Buddists,\nall have been at each others' throats\nsince the dawn of time.\nWhat is most amazing is that, in\na science college, doubts are still\nregarded by students \u2022 as\nunacceptable. Surely we welcome\ndoubt. It allows us to question the\nworld and its workings without the\nprejudices of religion. How long\nwill it take to release ourselves from\nbigotry? We should see religion as\nit really is; a waste of time, and a grabber of money. If anyone doubts\nthis, they need look no further than\nthe USA and the evangelistic\npreachers on prime time-television.\nIC Radio\nIC Radio are applying for an FM broadcasting licence, to use in\nFreshers' Week next year. This has\nFelix 951\nbeen granted to other student radio\nstations in the past, and there is a reasonable chance of them getting\nit. The licence is granted by the\nRadio Authority, and approval\nwould be more likely if senior\nmembers of College were to 'put in\na good word'. If any persuasion was\nneeded; a serious student radio\nstation would attract students to\nstudy in central London. Is\nanyone out there listening?\nChristmas Special\nNext Friday as you rush into college\nto get your fresh copy of Felix, you\nmay well be disappointed. Felix\nwill not appear until Wednesday\n16th December. But it will be an\nextra-large, bumper-packed, super-special festive issue. If the Union\ndoes not burn down with Felix staff\nunable to get out of the fire doors\n(whiff of crisp turkey), you should\nhave two supplements to take home\nand impress your friends, relatives\nand budgie. Please be patient, even\n4 December 1992\nthough I know it will be hard to go\nwithout your regular fix of Felix\nnext Friday.\nCredits\nNews: Declan, Mimi, Phil,\nGareth.\nFeatures: Beccy, Mimi, David\nSpooner.\nReviews: Sara, Poddy, Ian,\nMario, Rob.\nWhat's On: James, Poddy.\nSports: Sarmad, Jonathan.\nBunches of holly to: Rose, Andy,\nPhil H, Steve Newhouse, Gina,\nDom, Red Mullet, Rick, Chris,\nAndy Kerr, Rachel, Gareth,\nSam, Simon.\nThis has been another spectacular\nedition of Felix. The Felix staff\nwould like to wish good luck to\nDom as he tries to come up with a new catchphrase over the Christmas\nholidays. Kick off those canary\nyellow sweatshirts and bring back\nthe rubin e. Cat's Eyes\nNear Miss\nThe IRA attempted to savagely\nblow up the Dominion theatre last\nTuesday where the Prince and\nPrincess of Wales were to attend the\nRoyal Variety Performance in a few\ndays time, but failed miserably due\nto three small errors: The first is\nthat Scotland Yard received a coded\nwarning, (obviously not that well\ncoded); the second is that a mysterious figure was seen on the\nroof of the theatre, allegedly\nplanning a second bomb (probably\nthat millionaire Texan, Steve whats-his-name, plotting his revenge\nagainst Princess Di for not leaving\nher husband); and thirdly,\naccording to some reports, they\nforgot to prime the bomb (cue mass\nhysterical laughter).\nTheir target was meant as a gesture of defiance following\nrevelations that they had planned to\nassassinate the couple nine years\nago at the same venue, but thanks\nto an accomplice turned informer,\nallegedly, the police were tipped\noff, (and I thought back-stabbing\nonly occurred within the House of\nCommons).\nBut Tuesday nights lucky escape\nwas the third in a row for London.\nHow many lucky escapes can we\nhave before our luck runs out?\nAids\nI am sick of having the safe sex\nmessage being thrust down my\nthroat every time there is yet\nanother AIDS awareness week.\nAlong with all the mountain of\nbump h that is suddenly available,\nthere are always a multitude of\ndocumentary- type programmes that\nappear on TV about people who\nhave the HIV virus and are at some\nstage on the road to a painful death.\nNearly all of these programmes\nhowever are about your average,\nordinary heterosexual who has\ncontracted the virus by blatant\nstupidity. What about the drug users\nand homosexuals? TV has\napparently ignored these members\nof the public, again showing signs\nof prejudice to these people as if it\nis them that heterosexuals should\nblame for the spread of AIDS.\nIf TV is an unbiased medium then\nI must be watching the wrong\nprogrammes since all these AIDSumentarys are total bollocks as far\nas fairness is concerned.\nP.J. Dodd\nBeit\nBack Are YOU so wise that you can put\na price on people's safety?\nObviously we have been blessed\nthis year with some of the most\nfantastic sabbaticals since Einstein\nbecause this is exactly what they are\ndoing. Time after time they have\nbeen warned that Union Security is\nnot what it should be and the only\nresponse to calls for more Stewards\nor better equipment is \"we can't afford it\". It also seems that last\nyear's Deputy President, Ye Olde\nlohn ny Griffiths (32), trained\nTricky-Ricky-Bilby very well. In\nfact Rick seems to be doing exactly\nwhat Jonathan did last year\u2014as far\nas security goes, absolutely nothing.\nLet's take a look at last Friday\nnight. Six hundred or more people\nin the Union Building, one fire\ndoor. Now, while fire alarm\nsystems may be the domain of\ncollege management and not the\nunion, did it not occur to those who\nwe voted to power last February to\nsubstantiate the claim that the East\nand West fire doors would\nmagically release themselves in the\nevent of an emergency? And what\nform of telepathy are patrons of the\nunion bar expected to exercise when\nthe alarms sound everywhere but in\nthat infamous drinking hole? Yes,\nwhile being almost inaudible in Da\nVinci's, the alarm did not even\nsound in the other bar. Oh, and let's not forget the disco. Friday night\nbopper s probably thought the bells\nwere part of the sound effects\u2014\nonce again, IF they heard them. We\nwere lucky on Friday night. It could\nhave been the 'major incident' that\nsome have been prophesying. And\nthen what mess would the licensees\nhave been in? I believe there are\nlaws governing the provision of\n'steward' type staff at events\u2014are\nthese laws being met?\nWe might not like the high and\nmighty attitude of some of the\nstewards but when you think about\nit in the cold light of day, they have\na very difficult job coping with 600\nstudents under the influence. They\nhave a lot of experience, and from\nwhat I can see most display above\naverage levels of common sense,\nresponsibility and professionalism.\nSo why are they not being listened\nto? Virtually every Friday night\nthere is 'an incident', ranging from\nverbal assaults on union staff to full\nscale evacuations. A year ago there\nwas a vast change in union security\nwhen card checking was introduced\nand the then duty officers started\nworking in groups on Wednesday\nand Friday nights using age old\nradios to stay in touch (this after a duty officer was assaulted). Now it\nis time for another such vast\nchange. However, since the\nbeginning of term (when, it seems,\nan external source made a detailed\nreport on the faults with union\nsecurity) nothing has changed. A person who was only last year a student, who has no experience or\nknowledge in the field of\norganisational security, and whose\nmoney control policy is simple\n(don't spend any), is responsible for\nyour safety. COULD YOU LIVE\nWITH YOURSELF IF SOMEONE\nGOT SERIOUSLY INJURED IN\nTHE UNION, RICK?\nViews expressed in this article are\nnot necessarily shared by Felix\nstaff or ICU staff.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "'eat ure4 December 1992 Felix 951\nLadies and Gentlemen, it gives me\ngreat pleasure to present, for your\ndelectation, the hysterically funny,\nthe shockingly adolescent\nmaking another taste-free entrance\ninto British homes, at no particular\noffence to your sensibilities and\nintellect, I give you, THE VIZ\nVIDEO EXTRAVAGANZA!!( Cue trumpet fanfare)\nWhen I first saw the comic Viz\nway back in 1987, its lip-smacking\nhumour and fireproof wit seemed to\nbring new life to what had\nessentially become a haggard and\nprematurely flogged format, much\nthe same as the Young Ones had\nre vitali sed the sitcom idea by taking\nthe piss out of it. What materialise d were the sort of plots, and the sort\nof kids, that gestated around minor\npublic schools in pre-war Britain,\na hearken back to the days of The\nBeano, Just William and all those\npre-pubescent fantasy characters\ndreamt up by people who really did\nnot have cause to patron is e children. Arguably, the same fate\nawaited Viz; Viz's unique\nattraction, however, was the\nmagnificent injection of cartoon\nviolence and the intelligent\napplication of 'adult' themes to its\nstories and characters, but with the\ncomic's cornerstones being the\nimmensely puerile Johnny\nFartpants, Buster Gonad, and\nPostman Plod, the honeymoon had\nto end. Viz officially ceased to be\nfunny in January 1989.\nNotwithstanding this minor\nsetback, Viz stuck its tongue in its\ncheek even further than before and\nstoically refused to accept the\ninevitable. Result? The 'comic for\nadults' went from strength to\nstrength, astutely acquiring for itself\na couple of (much) lesser rivals,\nwhose names escape me in much\nthe same way as their humour does.\nBut, to return to our topic. In\nDecember 1990, Channel 4\ncommissioned from John Brown\nPublishing (the organisation behind\nViz) a cartoon featuring Billy the\nFish, a half-man, half-fish character\nwho played the Goalkeeper in a bewildering homage to Roy of the\nRovers. Also featured on the team\nwere Brown Fox, a 'Large-Breasted\nSquaw', Johnny X, the obligatory\ninvisible man, Mick Hucknall from\nSimply Red ('he failed to deliver\nafter a promising start, in a bizarre\nparody of his pop career'), and\nVIDEOS 'Eeh, San, see that feller? 'E's begg in' fer it'\nShakin' Stevens. With Harry\nEnfield doing the voices, 'Billy the\nFish-the Motion Picture' was a triumph. They followed this with\n'Roger Mellie, the Man on the\nTelly', a foul-mouthed and\nincredibly tactless children'sTV presenter brought to life by Peter\nCook. Again, it made hugely\nentertaining, though by no means\ncompulsive, viewing. It appears that\nrecent attempts to repeat these\nsuccesses with 'Sid the Sexist' and\n'The Fat Slags' have been, shall we\nsay, a little fraught.\nThe nature of the problem lies\nwithin the material itself. While\n'Roger.Mellie' has much content\ndesigned to offend, the concept is\n'politically' sound, something\nneither Sid or the Slags can claim\nto have. Channel 4 declined to show\nthem; therefore, both have been\nmarketed through video where they\nremain reasonably accessible. A few weeks ago, Felix was admitted\nto a secret location, with a privileged group, for a very special\nscreening\nThe initial feeling among the\ngroup was one of disappointment.\nThe first witness, who declined to\nbe named and for the purposes of\nthis article will be referred to as\n'Dom', said he found 'the transfer\nfrom paper to celluloid interesting,\nbut the wi b bly wobbly bits with the\nFat Slags were not present; they\nwere no more disgusting than the\nrest of the characters, which was the\nproblem'. 'Sam' disagreed; she\nsaid, T found the Rubber\nPanhandlevision brought them to\nlife superbly', and, when asked\nwhich character he preferred,\n'Dom' plumped for Sid, as 'it was\na lot more continuous, with more\nfunny one-liners'. 'Phil', the\nevening's whipping boy, decided\n'yes', when the rhetorical question\n'is Sid really that extreme when in\nthe context of Imperial College?\n'was asked of no-one in particular.\nAn embarrassing silence followed,\nbefore he hastily added that there\nwere no such comparisons with the\nSlags. Sid the Sexist, the general\nfavourite, features the voice of Bob\nMortimer, drinking down the local,\ngetting chucked out of the disco,\nand a holiday in Marbella, where\nhe and his chums come a cropper\nwith 'some d ago bush'. A cartoon\nin the conventional sense, as\nopposed to the plastic in e Fat Slags,\nfeaturing Waynetta Slob of Harry\nEnfield's 'the slobs'. They ate a great deal of food, drunk a great\ndeal of beer, and shagged a couple\nof taxi drivers, some very drunk,\nvery little men, one or two of their\nprospective employers, and their\ndentist, all on the grounds that they\nwere 'begg in' fer it', or that \"e couldn't keep 'is 'and s off me'. If\nthere was ever any doubt about the\nreality of these characters at all,\nbelieve me. I'm from the North,\nand these people are real, but this\nis not regional humour. Sandra,\nTracey, Sid, Bob, Barry, and the\nfunny little one with the weird hair\nand a nose like a miniature\nelephant's trunk have all got solid\nfoundations in their characters. Yes,\nthey're extreme, they're as\noffensive as animation could ever\npossibly get, they're frequently\nhysterical, and the strange thing is,\nthe animation does them an\ninjustice.\ng>ou rh to dl S> all\nJkubtoarbenSfjip Vacant?\nThis lively and demanding Hall needs a committed,\ncaring and responsible post-graduate to replace the one\nwho's leaving.\nLarge rent free accommodation suitable for a single\nperson is provided.
