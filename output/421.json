    "content": "* FELIX EXTERNAL ECLAIRS\nAS YOU PROBABLY know by\nnow, trainee teachers all over\nBritain are occupying their\ncolleges after the ball was set\nroiling in Scotland a fortnight\nago. You may not realise why\nrational and normally moderate\nstudents are taking such\ndrastic action. They want to\ndraw the attention of the public\nto the Government's cuts in\nteacher training and in teaching\nnumbers, which mean that up to\n80% of students leaving\ncolleges this summer will not\nobtain jobs in teaching - or\nprobably in anything else.\nIt is not often that the\nentire student movement is\nunited on one issue but this is\nthe case over Education Cuts.\nEven the Federation of\nConservative students reject\nthe position of the Tory Party\non this matter, although some\nof their membership privately\nadmit that they see no alternative for the Government. It\nseems senseless to discard\nthese teachers who are so badly needed in schools. After\nall, only a fraction of the\npopulation enter Higher and\nFurther Education,but everyone\ngoes through Education between\nthe ages of five and sixteen ,\nand so this is where scarce resources should be concentrated. The Government have of\ncourse been surprised by the\nfalling of the birth rate and\nEDITORIAL Alternative Prospectus\nTHE DECISION to re-edit and reprint the Alternative\nProspectus ( AP) must, I suppose, be welcomed, particularly\nsince College are to foot the bill. Nevertheless it is rather\npre sump tio us of College to seek to edit a student publication\nwhen they have continually refused to permit students to\nedit their Prospectus( barring the IC Union section).\nThe College Prospectus does have factual errors in it,\nand fails to give prospective students a full picture of what\ngoing to college entails. Besides forgetting to mention that\nmost students find some, if not all, of their courses and\nlecturers boring, the prospectus gives a false financial\noutlook.\nStudents coming to IC this October have been told that\nthey 'can expect to pay, at current prices, about 25p for\nbreakfast, 30p for lunch and between 2Sp and 50p for an\nevening meal'. No mention can be found in the Prospectus of the quality of IC refectory food. Next year's Fresher s certainly are in for a shock.\nThe same Prospectus quotes tenn ly hall rents asL instead( \u00a380.25, Southside (\u00a352.75) and Be it New Hostel( \u00a350.25).\nRents will in fact be \u00a3145.60, \u00a3105.60, \u00a3 105.60 respectively.\nThe paltry disclaimer 'The information given in this\nProspectus is that current to going, to press. May 1975, and\nis subject to alteration' does nothing to nullify the College whitewash.\nAll in all College officials and academics should not\nthrow stones at the first AP when they themselves live in a glass parapet.\nDespite this, one fact does stand out; the AP is a needless waste of money. If the College were prepared to\ntell prospective students the whole truth there would not\nbe a need for a student Prospectus. There are two possible ways out of the current hypo-c irt ical situation. Firstly a joint College and Union board\nshould edit the College Prospectus with each party having\nequal say. This would remove the need for an AP. Secondly\nthe Prospectus could be altered to include the\" official College section and on solely student-edited AP section. Both ways would save College money. Correspondence on\nthis subject is welcomed. Paul Ekpenyong\nhave opted to maintain the\nstatus quo rather than to use the resultant surplus of\nteachers to reduce class sizes throughout the system.\nLast year, the number of\nteachers in maintained schools increased by 16000. The predicted intake for each of the\nnext five years is only 8000 \u2014\na decrease of 50%. In addition,\nthe increasing graduate\nunemployment means that\nteacher tai ning students have\nto complete for jobs with a greater number of graduates\nfrom the Universities. A year ago, the DES expected\nto attain the teacher-pupil\nratios put forward by the ninth\nreport of the National Advisory\nCouncil on the Training and\nSupply of Teachers ( N ACT ST) and the ten percent increase\nput forward by the 1972 White\nPaper, \" A Framework for\nExpansion\". It now seems\ndoubtful whether even these\naims will be reached \u2014 and\nprospects of removing all classes in excess of thirty\nseem even more remote.\nD Everett\nICPGG- a new breath\nof life needed\nDOES IC need a postgraduate\ngroupe? The answer is, I believe, most emphatically,\n' yes'. The form it should or\nwill take is far from settled. The group has struggled\nby this year, but for the\nmajority of this time it has\nhad no chairman, few active\nmembers and even fewer\nmeetings. Credit should be\ngiven to Richard Upton, who\nhas kept the very threads of\nthe group together. He originally\nintended to be the treasurer\nbut found himself, by default,\nwearing the hats of chairman,\nsecretary and treasurer.\nOn the social side, the\ngroup has organised a success ful theatre trip just before\nEaster and is at present\npreparing for its summer\nextravaganza. The latter will take the form of a magical\nmystery tour on the Thames\nwith transport in the form of a boat with disco, bar and\nfood even. This should happen\non a balmy summers evening\nearly in July. This year has also seen\nthe setting up of a working\nparty within the College to\nconsider the future direction\nof PG education and the\nposition of and the. needs of\nthe PG s in the College. This working party has three PG members and id due to report\nsoon.\nExternally, as well, PG \"education has been under\nclose scrutiny from all sides. The Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals, the S RC and the Parliamentary\nExpenditure Committee have\nall produced reports on\npostgraduate education. The\nimplementation of the recommendations of these reports is imminent and could cause many changes in the system\nas we know it. Not all of these\nrecommendations are, I feel, in the best interests of students\nor of education.\nPG' s must take an interest\nand an active part in the\nmaking of decisions concerning\ntheir future and education. In\na college with such a large\nPG sector as IC has, it is amazing that over 1500\npost grads make so little\nimpact and that their combined\nvoice is so pathetic.\nMost post grads at IC give\nthe impression of being here\nto work and work only. We\nare here to work but surely\nthere are other things to be\ngained from one's time here.\nThe IC postgraduate group\nmust be put back on its feet.\nYou can make a start next\nweek by coming to the AGM on Wednesday 2nd June at\n1.00pm in Ele c Eng 408.\nSee Mr Upton, the one man\nexec. Hear reports on the PG world for the past 12 months.\nElect some officers for the\nnext year. (Why not be one\nyourself?)\nBuy a ticket for the river\nboat party.\nAll this and more.\nICP GG needs a new breath\nof life. If you are an IC PG come to the AGM and help us\nto give you a postgraduate\ngroup to satisfy your every\ndesire.\nRick Parker\n\n"

Overall we\nfinished 8th in a time of 12\nhours 34.43, and were presented\nwith a prize for 'the most\nunfortunate team'.The race was won by a Nijmegen team in a time of 10.54.20.\nThe whole event was\nbrilliantly organised by the\nhosts at Nijmegen (as were\nthe associated celebratory\nactivities). It created a unique\natmosphere throughout which\ncompelled us to promise our\nreturn next year.\nEngland to catch a train\nto Dover. Here we joined a motley bunch from Reading,\nSurrey and (inevitably)\nBrunei Universities to take\npart in the Batavieren road\nrelay in Hoi land.\nThe race consists of 24\nlegs of between 5 and 12.5km( covering a total of about\n120 miles) and begins at\nmidnight on the Friday/Saturday\nfrom Nijmegen University\n(which managed to produce 22\nteams for the event!!) By the\nthird leg our team had a lead\nof about a kilometer over the\n2nd of the 62 entrants. By\n03.00, the race had passed\nfrom Holland, into West Germany\nover the Rhine and back into\nHolland, and it was soon\nafter the border that CU number\n1 occurred. One of our number\nfollowed a member of the\nEindhoven team who failed\nmiserably in an attempt to\nnavigate by the stars and added\n4 miles to his stint, dropping\nus several places, to mention\nbut a few. CU's2,3 and 4\ninvolved our minibuses failing\nto deposit runners for leg x in\ntime to take over from those\nrunning leg x1. At 06.45, the first of 3\nrestarts took place. The times\nfor the teams so far were\nrecorded and the 10th leg\nrunners all set off together.\nThis was my stage, and I covered the 8.9km in a time\nof 31.06 to come in 8th. In\nthe heat of the day, Alf ran\nhis leg of (a very long) 9km in\na time of 34.45 to finish 5th fastest for the 17th stage.\nRichard Harrington\n'VOICES'\nARE NEEDED IN THE BBC's BENGALI SERVICE BROADCASTS TO THE SUBCONTINENT We are always on the\nlookout for new talent in\nBroadcasting in Bengali. Our\nprogrammes \u2014 Current\nAffairs, Drama and a wide\nrange of general interests \u2014\nneed a variety of contributors-Some are needed for just\nreading Bengali scripts\nbut the work is mostly\ntranslation and reading;\nstandard BBC fees are paid.\nWe shall be holding\nauditions during June.

The team left\nWandsworth early on Saturday\nmorning, confident of being\nable to produce good runs in\nthe event on Sunday; however,\nafter experiencing great\ndifficulty in finding a route out\nof North London to the M1, it\nwas decided that further training\nin navigation was required. With\nthis in mind, the team left the\nmotorway at lunchtime in an\nattempt to find a pub, selected\nfrom a certain well-known\npublication. This time the\nnavigation was perfect, and the\nteam continued the journey in\nhigh spirits.\nIn the afternoon, a training\nevent was held with the IC\nteam limiting their activities to very slow and easy running\nround one of the shorter\ncourses. All the team managed\nto miss their chosen start\ntimes, due to the fact that\ntheir watches were adjusted to\nBritish summer time, whereas\nthe event was being run at\nsome arb it ary Yorkshire mean\ntime, approximately 7 minutes\nin advance of real time. After\nthe event, Alan Leakey\nattended the British Orienteering\nFederation AGM, leaving the\nrest of the team at the campsite\nto attempt to put up the tent;\nwithout the assistance of\ntent pegs: we are still puzzled\nas to why Alan needed these\nat the AGM. Sunday's event, held in\nCropton Forest, near Pickering, ran to a more standard\nOrienteering time (a few\nminutes late compared with\nBST), and thus all the team\nmanaged to arrive at the\nstart on time, after an energy-sapping struggle with the\ntent. The forest was fairly\nhilly, and soft underfoot, with\nlarge areas of brambles and\ndense undergrowth making a lot of the going quite tough.\nA good network of roads and\nrides simplified navigation on\nthe longer stages, but on these\nstages there were always several possible routes to\nchoose between.\nDavid Rosen had another\nvery good run to finish 4th,4 minutes behind winner\nGeoff Peck, in a time of 90\nmins 15 sees for the 12.8km course. The four major international selection races\nof 1976 have now been\ncompleted, and David has finished in the first four places\nin each of these, and he thus\nhas a good chance of being\nincluded in the British team\nof five for the World Championships in Aviemore in September.\nAs the ' A' class was restricted to 60 competitors,\nAlan Leakey and Rob All in son competed in the B class, over\na9.8 km course: both had\ngood runs to finish 43rd and\n50th in 9 2 . 1 3 and 95.29\nrespectively. Ian Isherwood, in\nhis first championship race,\nran the 7km C course in 86.45,\nfinishing about 50th: this was a very good run after some\ndisappointing performances in\nrecent weeks. Of other UL runners in the event, Alastair Doyle was27 th in the A class in 102 mins, a good performance\nfor him, and Clive Reid57 th in the B class in 97 mips 5 5 .\nThe team, by now highly\nproficient in navigation,\nmanaged to find another pub\non the way home in which to\ncelebrate their good runs. It\nwas here that Ian earned his new nickname, 'the Cu co za de kid'. Our thanks go to the\nevent organisers for a very\nfine event, and to several\nnorthern breweries for their\nvery fine refreshments.\nCricket\nNELP overwhelmed\nALONG THE East India Dock\nRoad into Barking travelled\nthe 1st XI to play the North\nEast London, Polytechnic last\nWednesday. IC skipper Tom\nGhosh won the toss and decided\nto bat. In what was to be a40 over match but after 31\nbecame a35 overs match,\nsupposedly because of poor\nlight. IC then accumulated 190\nfor 8, significant winnings\ncoming from Maurice Throbb\n(59), Tom Ghosh (31) and Nick Morton (28).\nNE LP never looked as if\nthey would score at the required\nrate of over 5 runs an over so some players were given the\nrare opportunity of bowling by\nthe generous Captain. Eventually however NE LP were dismissed for 127 with two recognised\nbowlers taking most of the\nwickets; notably Dave Mill an fw tt fi4 for 26 and Dave Bramley\nwith 3 for 28.\nTeam: T Ghosh, D Millard,\nV Brown, N Morton, K de Silva,\nA Paul, S Godding, J Coates,\nD Bramley, P Jeffs, A Han.\n\n"

Lets face it, anyone mention the Kinks and\npeople immediately think back to those\ngreat singles of the sixties that flowed\nfrom the pen of Ray Davies. Yet, they\nhave been largely ignored by the majority,\nnot gaining anywhere near the success with their albums that they deserve. The\nthing is, Davies has always written\ngood songs. 'Considering for instance the\nKinks' rock opera 'Arthur' was a far\nbetter attempt at this abused fusion than\nthe acclaimed shambles that was Tommy,\nthere is no reason to believe that\n'Schoolboys in Disgrace' will achieve the\nmass sales it deserves. Throughout his songwriting, Davies has had a sort of tongue in cheek dig at\nthe Establishment, this album being no\nexception. It takes the concept of a young lad's trials and tribulations\nthrough his school life. He quickly\nbecomes a social misfit, later gets\nhimself into trouble with a naughty girl\nand is finally expelled by the headmaster,\nall of which leaves him feeling bitter\ntowards the Establishment for the rest of\nhis life. A bit crass you might think, but\nDavies of course, treats the whole affair\nwith tongue firmly in cheek.\nI could write about how melodic the\nindividual songs are, how they fit into\nthe concept perfectly, how clever the\nlyrics are, but as a concept it should be\njudged as a whole, and all I can say is\nit works perfectly, ' another fine Ray\nDavies effort that will hopefully achieve\nfor the man the recognition he warrants.\nFor the fact remains that only perhaps\nIan Drury of the Kilburns has got anywhere near the Davies sense of the\nEnglish melodrama, and he too may\nsadly be overlooked by the media. These\ntwo are truly English sing writers, in\nso much as one never finds them indulging\nin any sort of Americana, like so many\nof their British con temper aries who\nattempt to American is e their songs and\nend up achieving that strange mid-atlantic feeling-wetness.\nIan Morse\nBilly Wright and soap?\nSURPRISE SISTERS( Good Earth)\nWITH THE success of the abysmal Rock\nFollies television series, there seems\nto be a vogue toward all girl groups. The\nSurprise Sisters were perhaps put\ntogether specifically with the ambition\nof complimenting the accomplishment of\nthe Little Ladies. The result anyway is a polished, if slightly processed, sounding\ndebut album.\nThis record is much better than that\nwhich is high in the charts at present.\nFor a start the songs are better \u2014 but then\nthe songs on Rock Follies are atrocious\nanyway and these girls actually can sing, something alas, that cannot be said of\nthe Little Ladies. Ecstacy for all\nDaevid Allen: Good Morning\nFOLLOWING THE demise of the planet\nGong, Daevid Allen, GilliS 'myth and a host of PHP' s, octave doctors and other\ngentle folk have taken refuge on the\nBalleark Isle of Majorca. Whilst on this\nsunny isle, they, together with a Spanish\nband called \"Euterpe\" carried on\nproducing the euphoric music that Gong\nunder their influence used to produce.\nSide one is a collection of spacey\nfolk muses which seem to bear a distant\nrelationship to early Kevin Ayers styles. Side two has one track in the same\nstyle as side one and then launches into\na time called \"Wise man in your heart\"\nwith Mike Howlett on bass, Pierre\nMoerlin on drums, Pepe Milan on glock ens peil and Gilli with space whisper. The\nstyle is that of \" Love is what U want\" from \" An geTs Egg\". Is this track a fond\nfarewell to the much beloved planet?\nThis is followed by abloom dido type\nsax entree into \"She doesn't she...\", a happy melodic track relating how \"The\nreal pot head pixie has learnt to speak\nSpanish\". Of course, this album will not only be enjoyable to filthy drug\naddicts, perverts and sch niz oph re nics, but you too could derive a state of ecstasy\nfrom this beautiful pathway to Nirvanah.\nGnome\nThe album starts with the best cut,\nDavid Gates' 'Watch Out'. Given an\nintelligent Philly sounding brass arrange-ment, it gives a first impression that\nthe Sisters are in fact a white soul act,\nbut not really. It becomes apparent as\nyou listen to the record progress, .that\nthe sings become more diluted, until\nyou reach about halfway through the\nsecond side when they become little\nmore than middle of the road pap,\nresembling more a sort of bleached\nPointer Sisters, they (the Surprises)\nlacking the drive and range of the\nAmerican outfit.\nI doubt very much if the album will\nbring them any great success and indeed\nthe late seventies will bring any form of\nrevival for all girl groups, like the fad\nachieved twenty years ago, when the\nlikes of the Kaye Sisters, the Vernon\nGirls, Allison s and the wonderful\nBeverely Sisters adorned the hit parade.\nWho could ever forget the Beverely\nSisters?

Grants up18 per cent\nAP REHASH\nTHE RECTOR has decided to\nsalvage the Alternative\nProspectus ( AP) by asking\nRick Parker ( ICU Academic\nAffairs Officer) and Peter Mee\n(College Registrar) to check\nthe existing edition and\nproduce a prospectus devoid\nof factual, punctuation and\ngrammatical errors.\nShould changes to copy be\nnecessary then the sections\nconcerned will have to be\nreprinted. FELIX editor and\nnext year'sIC Academic Affairs Officer Paul Ek pen gong feels that due to the\nnature of printing the whole\nprospectus may well have to\nbe reprinted at a cost of over\n\u00a3900.\nThe additional cost will be met by the College. Originally it had been' hoped to send out the AP with the College Prospectus, thus saving postage costs. This will now not be possible. The new AP will probably be\nready for distribution in July and postage costs are thus\nlikely to be around \u00a3600.\nSo the AP, which initially\nhad a budge of \u00a31,100 looks\nset to cost anything up to\n\u00a32,500 all told. The full\ncosts of the AP, are being met\nby the College. Accommodation For those who will be\ndown in London looking for\nflats for next session, the\nUnion is running a Temporary\nAccommodation Scheme. The Scheme runs from 18th to 25th September inclusive. Rooms\nwill be available at the cost\nof 50p per night plus a \u00a35\nreturnable key deposit.\nAll you have to do, if you wish to make use of this\nfacility, is to turn up at th fe IC Union Office on the days\nconcerned. You must also bring with you, a sleeping\nbag, otherwise it is the cold\nhard floor for you. Please do not\nbring all your luggage with\nyou.\nTHE DEPARTMENT of\nEducation and Science(DES)\nyesterday announced increases in undergraduate\ngrants of about187.. The new\ngrant levels (with this year's figures in brackets) are \u00a3 9 5 5\n( \u00a3 8 1 0 ) for college based\nstudents in London, \u00a3875\n(\u00a3740) for college based\nstudents outside London, and\n\u00a3675 (\u00a3570) for students living at home. Last year the\ngrant levels were raised by\n22%.\nAccompanying the grants\nincreases are changes in parental contributions and in the amounts of Supplementary\nBenefit that students can claim in the Christmas and\nEaster vacations. From September onwards the starting\npoint for parental contributions\nrises from \u00a32,200 ' Residual Income' to \u00a32,700. ADES spokeswoman said that\nparental contributions will be\nreduced throughout the scale. As expected students will no longer be able to claim supplementary benefit in the\nshort vacations.\nFurther details of the\naward are not yet known.\nPessimism\nFirst reactions to the\naward have been tepid and pessimistic: An NUS spokesman\ncommented that 'the award\nwould do little to shore up\nthe ravages of inflation'. Over\nhalf their members would not\nbenefit from the changes in\nparental contribution. They\nwere also disappointed that\ndiscretionary awards remained\nunaltered.\nEx ICU President Trevor\nPhillips was more profound.\n'An 18% increase is .definitely\ninadequate and at first sight\nstudents in London are going to\nface the same problems arising\nfrom an inadequate grant but\nonly more so.\n'To a degree it demonstrates\nthe cynicism and bankruptcy of\nGovernment policy on public\nexpenditure because, in spite of universal agreement that\nthe grant level is- too low,\nthey (DES) appear to have\nreduced it even further in\nreal terms.'\nComments from IC Officials were a little more optimistic:\n'My immediate reaction' said\nICU\u2014President Peter Teague, 'is that it is a very good award.\n18% is better than I expected,\nbut a great deal depends on\nthe details of the schemes for\nnext year which 1 have not\nyet had time to acquaint myself\nwith.'\nOn a more centre vers i al note\nhe added, 7 would rather have\nseen this extra money put\ntowards abolishing the parental\nmeans test'. #\nA more reserved attitude\ncame from the Rector, Sir Brian Flowers.7 don't think it\nwould be wise of me to comment\nin detail until I have seen the\nvery long document which I understand sets out the terms\nof the new award.'\n'1 believe there is some\namelioration of the threshold\nabove which the parental\ncontribution will be payable,\nbut on the other hand I think\nthere may be less opportunity\nfor claiming supplementary\nbenefits during at least the\nshort vacations.\n'Nevertheless the increase\namounts to 18% which at first\nsight is better than I had\nexpected.'\nHard times ahead\nTHE UNION was told last\nweek that it is to receive a10% increase in its block\nallocation from the Governing\nBody. This will mean an\nincrease per capita of 5.3%.\nThe Union had originally\nrequested a23% increase per\ncapita and was most d is appointed at the small increase\nit received.\nHowever, the College itself, is only receiving a4% rise in its grant although\nsupplements will be given for\nCollege salaries increases. The actual increase in the\nGoverning Body allocation to\nthe Union will be \u00a37,892 but,\non the latest figures, over\nhalf of this is accounted for\nin increased staff salaries( \u00a32,367) and increased NUS subscriptions (\u00a31,680).\nIncreases in Sabbatical\nSalaries and Hall Rents\naccount for another \u00a31,000\nthus leaving a total increase\nof \u00a32,845 to cover increases\non all other expenditure. The Union is still seeking clar if i cation on, whether the grant\nincludes \u00a31,300 for next year's Alternative Prospectus or\nwhether this will again be\ntreated separately. If it is included, then \u00a31,545 will be\nleft for increases in all other\nUnion expenditure.\nThe decision on the AP will determine whether clubs, societies and Union Committees\nreceive a2% or 4% increase on their allocations. With inflation\ncurrently running at 18%, ICU President, Peter Teague, says a curtailment of activity will necessarily result next year.\n\" RC C clubs will almost\ncertainly have to cut their rate\nof subsidy and ACC clubs may have to restrict the number\nof teams or fixtures for each\nclub', he said. Subsidization of\nsocial events such as Freshers\nDinners and Formal Balls will be drastically reduced.\nEntertainments may also have\nto be curtailed.\nAll in all, the future looks\nbleak for IC Union in the\nnext year.\n\n"

    "content": "Fill Appalling complacency\nSir,\u2014 Having read concurrently,\nboth the pieces which have\nappeared in the past two\neditions of FELIX on the\ntopics of academic work and'\nsocial activities at this\nCollege, I wish to air my own\nviews. Stephen Humby's article\nmakes curious reading; he\nseems to be, indeed he states\nquite explicitly;, that he is\ndissatisfied with College life\nat both the academic and social levels. He claims that answer,\ning the questions set on the\nworksheets is a moronic\nactivity; a view with which\nyour other correspondent, CG Miller, would seem to disagree,\nsaying that the way to conduct\none's work is to ' solve the\nproblems a little at a time'.\nObviously Miller is satisfied\nwith the system, a complacency\nwhich I find appalling. Where\nHumby makes his error is in\nconfusing the system of work\nwith the subject being studied.\nIt is the latter topic where I feel the discontent arises. THERE IS NOTHING so good\nfor exam depression which\nseems to spread like a flu\nepidemic, than to hear about\na good old English wedding;\na wedding that brings tears to\nmother's eyes; and masked\nrelief to father's. But not all\nweddings run as smoothly as\nthat. Let me tell you about a wedding which except for a few minor calamities passed\noff just as rehearsed!\nRight on time, the vintage\nRolls drew up outside the\nchurch and my sister climbed\ndown supported by my father's rather shaky right arm. Every thing ran quite smoothly until\nafter the service, when I had\nto sign the register. Of course,\nthere was one small problem;\nthe vicar only had a right-hand pen so an entirely new\ntechnique had to be employed\nif the phenomenon of a left-hand er emerged.\nWe tried the left edge of\nthe pen; then the right to no\navail until with the nib\ncompletely reversed, a spidery\nscrawl slipped across the\npage. Naturally this farcical\nThe contents of the various\nsubjects are at the moment in\nthis College, and in the\nscience faculties of other\ncolleges, devoid of real\ninterest. There is no unity in\na subject, no relationship, or\nelse very little between courses\nin the same subject, which\nis bad. What is even worse\nis that there is no connection\nbetween the different subjects,\nespecially in the physical\nsciences, the situation being\nslightly better in the biological\nsciences, though they could\nlearn from the physical\nsciences and viceversa. Although I have chosen the\nexample of science, I am sure\nthat, in the very nature of\nthings, similar remarks must\napply to all the subjects\nstudied at this College. The method by which a subject is studied, that is\nworksheets, may or may not be\nsuitable; it really depends on\nthe individual student and\nsweeping generalisations in\nthis respect are generally\nsituation took place in full\nview of the congregation and\nan audible filter was by now\nrippling through friends and\nrelations.\nThe first embarrassing\nsituation past, I returned with\nthe best man to the front pew.\nPraying posed another\nproblem. Seated on the pew, I could not understand why the\nkneel ers were so far away\nfrom the pews. Desperately\ntrying to recall school days\nwhen I was reluctantly compel led\nto kneel confined in a space\nof nine square inches for the\npurpose of praying, this\nspacious area overwhelmed me.\nNot satisfied with following\nthe example of the best man\nand my sister who knelt with\nsome grace upon their knees,\nI took two steps forward,\npulled out my kneel er and was\nabout to place it on the floor\nwhen the best man exploded\nin a stage whisper:\n\"What the hell do you\nthink your doing?\", which I thought was most irreligious.\nHowever, it did not end\nthere. Oh no, the fun had\nunsafe; but the content of\nwhat is studied certainly needs\nto be overhauled.\nTurning now to the social side of the life at this College, the position taken up by your\ncorrespondents appears to be\nthe same: Humby dissatisfied, Miller satisfied. In the latter\ncase, if Miller enjoys himself\nusing present facilities, he\nhas every right to continue to\ndo so. Equally Humby has the\nright to say 'I do not enjoy\nthe facilities'. However,\nwriting about not enjoying\nthem is not very constructive.\nIf he wants something different\nhe should get on and do\nsomething about it, not\ncrit is is e others for enjoying\nwhat he does not, an attitude\nof \"mind which I consider\nchurlish and smacking or\ndictatorship and sour-grapes.\nA Postgrad. Student\nSpoof\narticles\nSir, - In the past it has been\nnoted that articles have\nappeared in FELIX which\nwere pure inventions, of the\nauthor's imagination. These\narticles having no factual\nbasis. The first fic ti cio us fancy,\nonly just begun. I suddenly\nbecame aware of the insupportable weight of both my sister's and my bouquet; so I gave\nAnne's to the best man who\nplaced it on his seat and\nneedless to say would have\nsat on it if I had not laughed\nat the appropriate moment and\nsnatched it from beneath him.\nAfter all, crushed orchids\nwould not have looked very\npretty in the wedding photos\nwould they.\nSuddenly it was all over.\nI handed the bouquet back to\nmy sisTer, arranged her train\nand was just thinking how\nwell we had all done when I looked up to see the bride and\ngroom already 40 yards away\nfrom Sara and I.T his was really going too\nfar. She had warned me about\nthe danger of treading on her\ntrain, but this was too much\nof a dig. She was making her\nlack of confidence in her\naccident prone sister all too\napparent for all the world\nto see. Personally, I think for\nsomeone who has made her\nentrance to a party by walking\ninto, a( swimming) pool\nfully-clothed and nearly\ndrowned taking a swimming\ntest, I did quite well. I did\nnot fall into the font anyway,\nwhich was quite on the cards. Paula Marriott which appeared some time ago,\nwas taken to be quite humorous\nHowever, the frequency of\nfairy stories, appearing in\nFELIX, has become alarmingly\nhigh.\nSometime ago a letter was\nwritten showing concern about\nthe gossip column ' TITBITS'. The article did stimulate\nintrigue, but did not carry the\nauthor's name. The column\nwas considered an excellent\ninnovation, but it was thought\npersonal opinions might be\nexpressed, that in all fairness\nrequired the author the name\nhim or herself.\nWe wish to express two\nopinions. One is that, although\nmost of the improbable (and in\nretrospect humorous) literary\nflights of fancy, so far\nappearing, have been harmless,\nthere might one day appear an\narticle that could have unintentionally serious consequences.\nIt is also our opinion that the\ncredibility of FELIX is at the\nmoment suffering, and will continue to do so, from the\ninsertion of invented articles\nin the paper.\nWe hope you respect our\nviews, and consider them with\nthe seriousness we feel they\ndeserve.\nYours Sincerely concerned,\nE McAuliffe LSI\nP GRAY Civ Eng ICA BOWEN Chem 2\nCR HAIG H LSI\nD POSNER EE2K BOUGH LEY BE2C MILLER Q1\nREPLY FROM THE ED( Your opinions regarding spoof\narticles have been seriously\nconsidered and I fully agree\nwith your reservations about\nsuch articles appearing in\nFELIX. However, all spoof\narticles are carefully vetted to\nensure that they are not vin-dic ti ve, unpleasant, libellous\nor boring.\nThey are an attempt to relieve\nexam blues by taking a lighthearted look at things. I therefore hope that the\ncredibility of FELIX has not\nsuffered as a result of carrying\nout one of its prime functions\nwhich is to entertain people\nwhile, of course, providing\nthem with news and information\n-Ed.)\nFELIX Published by the Editor on\nbehalf of I.C.
