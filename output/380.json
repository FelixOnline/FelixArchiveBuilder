    "content": "1 FELIX\nMichael Williams THE FACT that the challenge for the\npresidency of Imperial College Union\nhas been unopposed could exert a profoundly detrimental influence on die more\npractical aspects of the forthcoming\nICU elections. The fact that there will have to be a separate College wide ballot fot the post of Deputy President\n(for neither of the two present can di dates were fully seconded when the\nnomination papers came down last Monday at 5p.m.) seriously exacerbates the\nsituation. Constitutionally, in the election of\nthe President. Deputy President. Hon.\nSecretary and Editor of FELIX, a threshold of over 1.000 voters has to be\nreached for the election to be valid. Now election interest from the voters'\npoint of view has traditionally focussed\non the race for the presidency. This year there can be no such race .\nAre the contests lor Hon .Sec.and\nthe Editorship of FELIX going to hold\nenough interest for the voters' so that\nthat 1,000 ballot-paper threshold can be\nreached0 The answer is simply: This can be so. It is up to those with the resources at their disposal to put out\n\" Vote!\" type publicity. And it is appropriate to ask the OCT.' Executives to\nexhort their cohorts as much as possible to go out and vote for the sake of\nIC\" Union.\n*\nA point which has to be made public-ally, however inopportune the moment\nmay be, is that the FF LIX cat motifs\nseen on some current electioneering\nbump h are being used without perm is sion. This is a regrettable state of\naffairs .\n*\nDid I not tell you so, Trevor7\nRegarding our bet on your UL U presidency\nmade over a snooker game in the small\nhours late last summer, I make it \u00a31\nthat you owe me !\n*\nI must apologise severally to some\nof the contributors to the letters column\nthis week for having to cut chunks out\nof their communications in order that\nthey might fit the space available .The\ntwo letters regarding Nietzsche were\nespecially long.

I would\nlike therefore with your leave,\nto examine this phenomenon\nusing the much ridiculed and\nmaligned, though basically cor-rect, techniques and theories\nof psycho-analysis developed\nby Jung, Freud and the more\nobscure T. Endur.\nIt does not require very deep\nanalysis to expose the motivation of this 'same' . The pinball\nmachine is merely an extension\nof the phallus, whilst the operation of the flippers ( nipples1) with passionately convulsive\npelvic thrusts is a sub-con-s cio us sexual intercourse.\nAttaining an orgasm is thinly\ndisguised as the 'replay'; die\n'tilt' when exuberant thrusting\nhas affected the machine is the\nselfish premature ejaculation\ndue to insufficient self control. The caco pha nous bells and\nbuzzers and die Hashing lights\nof the submissive, reclining\nmachine all serve to hold reserved for the beauty of the\nfemale body. Pt n bali has become a primitive sex substitute.\nHow often do you see women\n'playing the silver ball' and\nhave your readers never been\nstruck by the incongruity of\nthis sight?\nI think that my observations\nwill make clear to many of\nyour more sensitive readers the\ntruly primitive nature ot the\nlusts and desires of many students at our illustrious college.\nThe promulgation of the image\nof the Imperial student as a beer drinking, pinball playing,\nsuper-virile male and the competition between rival factions\nwithin the college for supremacy I find pitiful! and nauseous.\n1 hope that ill) analysis, the\ntruth of which cannot be doubt-ed, will serve to lead those who\nare penitent, towards the path\nof truth, beauty and virtue,\nFloreat Collegium! Annabel List z Imperial College\n24th February 1975.\nDear Fditor,\nWhilst avidly reading the\nlast issue of FELIX I noticed\nthat under the heading of\n\u2022 ' RCS l' Candidates\" my name\nwas omitted from the list of candidates for the post of Honorary Secretary of the Royal\nCollege of Science Union. 1\nhope this letter will rectify\nthis sad situ a lion. Yours electioneering ly, Dave Salisbury.\nChemical Engineering\nImperial College\n23rd February 1975.\nDear Sir,\nOn reading through the tedious verb age of Mr. Campbell's letter, FELIX. So. 379. two\nmain ideas emerge. The first is that Nietzsche was a member of\nthe German middle-class and as such his writing reflected their\ndesires and frustrations, the\nsecond concerns the d oct nne of\nthe \"Superman' .\nThe first reveals how Mr.\nCampbell goes hand in glove\nwith the Nazi's in trying to reduce a philosophical idea down\nto the level of political posturing . For though Nietzsche\nwas born into the class system\nhe lived his life alone and as\nan outsider, and his writing\nnever reflects an\\ bias that can\nhe considered to he caused by\ne lds pre iud ices. He saw through the tenuous social and moral\ncodes and in transcending\nthese systems ot \\alu es he\nfound himself in an intellectual\nvoid. Colin Wilson who in his\nbook \"The Outsider\" says of Nietzsche, \"For the Outsider,\nthe world into which he has\nbeen born, is a world without\nvalues. Compared to his own\nappetite for a purpose and dir-ect ion, the way most men live\nis not living at all, it is drift-ing. This is the Outsider's wretchedness Unless he\ncan evolve a set of values\nthat will correspond to his own\nhigher intensity of purpose, he\nmay as well throw himself under a bus ... '. However, Nietzsche viewed life positively\nand set himself the immense\ntask of climbing to new mental\nheights of perception and understanding and as he himself\nwrites in \"This spoke Zarathustra\" . \"Not the heights, but\nthe drop is terrible. That precipice into which the glance\nfalls down while the hand\ngropes up .. .''\n\" t/i Will clings lo man, with\nchains I bind mu self to man,\nbecause I am drawn upwards\ntowards the 'Superman', thither\ntends my other Will.\"\nThis brings me to the most\nimportant point: Mr Campbells\ninterpretation of the \"Super-man\" which is so far from the\ntruth that it shows how profound\nhis lack of understanding is!\nNo doubt a small portion of the\nblame could be attributed to\nthe use of the word Superman'\nwhich arouses misconceptions\non Darwinian lines i,e.a higher\nform of life to super cede 'home\ns a piers' however Nietzsche has\nunambiguously repudiated this\nin \"Ecce Homo\".\n\"To over throw idols,{idols\nis the name I give to all ideals)' is much more my business . In\nproportion as an ideal has been\nfalsely worshipped, reality has\nbeen robbed of its value, its\nmeaning and if: truthfulness...\"\nOr in other words the Superman is not a tall bronze-skin n ed god but a man who overthrows idols such as these.\nNietzsche' s works metaphorically use words like war\nand battle to describe the clash Continued on page 7\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nfla Boris John Shore Gene Clark: No Other( Asylum SYL 9 0 2 0 )\nFor those of you who cannot place the\nname, cast your mind back 70 years or so ago. Three men Jim Mcguim, David Cro s by, and Gene Clark started playing together and the legend of the Byrds was born.\nGene left the band in 1966 and disappeared in almost total oblivion for several\nyears before reappearing on the disappointing Byrds reunion album. Since then he\nhas toured as part of Roger (name change\nfrom Jim) Mogiun backing band and has\nspent months preparing for this album.\nThe album took six month's to record\nand even with a new producer the contains many of the best qualities originally\nfound in the Byrds music. Perhaps some\nof this may be due to the inclusion of an other ex Byrd; Chris Hillman amongst the\nlong list of ba clancy musicians. The harmony is still there although unfortunately\npolluted with too many \"Yeah Yeah\nGirls\". The instrumental have advanced\nalong way since those far off days, but\nhave changed much for the better. There\nare some magn if ici ent solos thrashed out\nin 'Lifes Greates Fool' and 'No Other'\nand in what is perhaps the best rack\n'Silver Raven' the piercing shrill notes\nJames Wilkinson Pierre Boulle: Monkey Planet(Penguin)\nThis book chronicles the fate of the\nfirst in terse llar expedition to the unknown\nregion of Alpha On on is( Betelgeuse to\nyou). The journey is completed in two years (ship time) due to rel atari stic effects. Soon after arrival at Betelgeuse\nthey find a planet very like earth with an\neminently breathable oxygen/nitrogen\natmosphere. A smooth landing on the\nplanet, christened Soror, follows an ariel survey showing that the surface of the\ngla net has been moulded by rational\neing s. However, a shock awaits our intrepid\nheroes! (Gosh, what can it be). 'Homo\nsapiens here was nothing but a naked\nanimal'. (The question arises that does\nan animal that cannot talk merit the title\nsapiens). 'The master race were Apes:\nApes that dressed like men and hunted\nhumans for their sport'.\nYes, folks you guessed it! It's the\nbook that gave the film (that gave four\nmore films) that resulted in the TV series\n'Planet of the Apes'. Too many films are\nbeing expanded into TV series. Enough\nsaid about that.\nThe book was actually bearable. I clearly felt the deep message that lurks\nbelow the surface of the plot in all worthwhile Science Fiction. con jur up a perfect image of a bird sweep-ing.\nThis is an excellent album which is\ngoing to suffer (unfortunately) from under\npublicity and I feel it will be \"an ideal\ncandidate in the years to come tar as one\nthat should have made it\" .\nRi z Shakir\nOut Of The Storm: Jack Bruce (RSO)\nFor those of you who can recall hearing the name before but cannot quite remember where - Manfred Mann; formed the\nrock group, Cream with Eric Clapton and\nGinger Baker and was Bruce in the highly successful rock band, Bruce and\nLaing. \"Out of The Storm\" is an album mainly basse d on guitar, bass and drums rock\ntrio. The album is well composed; the\nmusic Is pleasant and has definite overtones resulting from jazz and blues influence. Steve Hunter, who worked with\nAlice Cooper and Lou Reed plays all the\nguitar work and drums are shared by Jim Kettner and Jim Gordon .\nJack has written all the music and\nplays the bass with his customary mastery (nowhere is this more apparent than\nin,\" Time slip\", the last track). Jack and Pete Brown (an association which goes back to the Cream days) have\nwritten the lyrics, which are on thw whole\ngood and sometimes are \"mind blowing\".\nThe album is good without being\nbrilliant. Storm bringer: Deep Purple Side one starts with the sort of music\none does not normally associate with\nDeep Purple in so much as it Is much\ntoo slow moving. This however does not\nimply that the music is bad, far from it. The first three tracks are full of some\nexceptional music on the guitar as well as some simulated Stevie Wonder touches to the vocals, whilst the chorus on\nthe third track has that Elton stamp\nabout it. The last track has the good old Deep\nPurple rhythm and gets your feet taping.\nSide two starts with real Deep Purple\nstuff and the first track has bone shaking and fast moving rhythm. This is followed by some reverberating guitar\nwhich has that \" four beat rhythm\" to it\nand gets rather monotonous. This side\ncomes to a climax with a good disco track having a continuous and inspiring\nrhythm which Is easy to follow and hence dance to .\nThe last two tracks are somewhat\ndisappointing and are again slower moving . The last one being about a \"Sold-i er of fortunes\" and very slow moving\nindeed for Deep Purple .However the\nalbum is well arranged and makes pleasant listening.\nIt is a good buy for everyone and is an absolute must for Deep Purple fans.\nH.B. Greenhouse PremonitionsA Leap Into the Future (Pan)\nThis book purports to report a large\nnumber of documented cases of prem on it ions, asking the question: \"It they had\nbeen heeded could disasters have been\naverted.\" While I found the book interesting it was also unnerving .While travelling\nby rail I read the chapter concerning predictions of train crashes and nearby got off\nthe train at the first available stop. It de finitely encouraged spooky feelings .\nThe documentation on a great deal of\nthe cases was very impressive, but on others it was sketchy. Sometimes inferences\nare drawn which are questionable, and\noccasionally downright unfounded.\nIt is however a fascinating book, well\nworth the investment if you are interested.\nIncidentally there is a Premonitions\nBureau to which you can send predictions\noperating in this country-Address: British Premonitions Bureau\nTV Times\n247 Tottenham Court Road\nLondon W1 POA U H.G. Wells: The Invisible Man (Fontana)\nWhen I picked up this book I thought it\nwould be old fashioned and tedious. Granted the style is somewhat easier, the pace\nslower, than is today's fashion but once\nthe story was underway I found it very readable .\nIt has been said that good science fiction starts with one impossible (or imp rob able) premiss and the story should follow\nfrom that with no further i mpla usability. Wells' story does this . The style easily\nmakes you believe in the pla usability of\nthe idea that a man could make him s lef invisible. He even explains why no-one has-done it since. Support your local author (de-ceased). Buy this book.\nPaul Ek pen yong Voices In an Empty Room\nPhilip Loriane\nI HAD previously read one of his ear lier books, '7he Mafia Kiss', a highly\nentertaining book.' Voices In An Empty\nRoom' has proved to be of the same good\nquality though it is a rather unusual psy-chic thriller.\nThe plot is an intricate one and the\nreader is carefully set up for a totally\nunexpected ending. The plot is woven\nround Ellie Spenser who is the love of\nJohn Lamb who begins to get more than a little worried when on a business trip he\nvisits her in San Francisco and finds not\nonly her behaviour strange but also her\nactions .\nHe sets out to try and find out, but before too long he comes up against Mrs\nAmelia Guardi and the medium Lulu. Why\nare they in San Francisco and why esp-ec i ally at Ellie' s Uncles' s house . The intrigue of family history past and present\nform the basis of a rather chilling thriller\nabout the obsession to bring back the past\nby one woman who is not all she seems.\nWell recommended.\n\n"

    "content": "4\nFEI IX ELECTION MANIFESTOES President CANDIDATE: PETE TEAGUE PROPOSER: JOHN MORTIMER \"WHY?\" I can hear many of you asking, and a good question it is too. I feel that\n1 have two main qualification for the job.(i) Organisational Ability: I am used to\nworking with and leading a team of workers and have had quite a lot of organisational experience in my Hall of Residence\naid RCS Union during my three years here.\nI also know a little of the present organisation of ICU.( W) Representational Ability: I have al ready been representing a large group of\nstudents and have become used to committee work, both Union and College. I am a sociable person by nature and find it easy\nto mix with people and obtain their opinions on student affairs.\nThe main areas on which I would like the Union to concentrate next year are the\nfollowing.\n(a) Lecturing Standards: For some time\nwe nave been trying to get improvements\nIn the standard of lec turin q which varies\nfrom reasonable to downright appalling.\nWe must press for more lecturers to talc e courses on how to lecture and to use visual aids etc. We should, I think, push for\nlecturers to be chosen on teaching ability as well as research abilities.( b) Accommodation: Many of our stu dents are faced with living a long distance\nfrom college In accommodation which Is\nquite unsuitable for students and at very\nhigh rents. The Union must be able to help\nIn this area, perhaps by trying to run an Accommodation Bureau for much longer\neach year; and also perhaps through obtaining short life accommodation from\nLocal. Councils.( c) Union Clubs: This seems to be the\nway in which most people at College are\nInvolved with their Union. I should like\nto see the Union going out to the Clubs more and trying to get some of the people\ninvolved in the central Union work.\n(d) Postgraduates: These suffer from\nspecial problems which I feel many of us\ndo not understand, I should like to investigate these and try to help solve some of\nthese.\nWell, it seems my words must come to\nan end, leaving me with many unsung\nideas. Please ask me anything you would\nlike my views on. Thanks for reading this\nfar.\nHon. Sec.\nCANDIDATE: JOHN DOWNS PROPOSER: MIKE ST ANGER IT IS quite clear that the position of\nHonorary Secretary of Imperial College Union involves a great deal of day-to xia y running of Union affairs . The Hon.Sec .\nhas to s it on many and varied committees,\noften taking minutes as well as representing student opinion. Beyond that, the Hon. Sec. must co-ordinate the activities of\nthose committees responsible to the Union\n(for example, Union Finance Committee)\nand must ensure that each is playing its proper role within the college.\nThis, in itself, is a full-time job. To quote our present secretary:\n\"I'm quite fully occupied lust keeping\nthings ticking over.\"\nIn addition, however, the Hon.Sec. has\na number of less tangible responsibilities. These include back in a up the dep. reps,\nencouraging union officers (including the\npresident!) and, of course, support i ug many of the College's social functions.\nLastly, the Hon Sec. must be\napproachable. He or she, for that matter - is the sole representative of the\nUnion of some committees, and must\ntherefore be diplomatic and responsive .\nI believe that my experience in I.C.U. and R.S. M. affairs would help me in carrying out these duties. I have been involved\nin a wide range of activities in college\nand have held posts on the following com-mitte es: Council( Carnival Co-or d in at or), Carnival Committee (Chairman), R.S. M. Council( acting Dep. Rep.), R.S. M.Ent s Committee (Revue Organiser), Tizard Hall Committee (Chairman 74/75, and Ents Officer 73/74), and on the Departmental\nAcademic Affairs Committee (2 years). I feel that such a broad range of interests\nis essential if the Secretary is to do his job effectively.\nI believe I have shown myself to be\nefficient and effective in my previous\nposts and that I have the a bulit y and experience to do a good job as next year's I.C.U. Hon . Sec. CANDIDATE: MALCOLM SPENCER PROPOSER: DAVE BARNESI have s pen four years at college, including one year at Kings College reading Mechanical Engineering before dec i ding that I was dissatisfied with the\ncourse and moving to IC to study Metal u rgy. In my time here I have held the\npost of Publicity Officer for the Entertainments Committee and achieved the\ndizzy heights of chairman this year. In\nundertaking these positions I have had\nthe opportunity of sitting on various\ncommittees and on occasions have been\nasked to attend Counci I. The job of Hon .Sec. is basically that of administration; it not only en vol ves the day to day running of the union\noffice but also the very important task\nof sitting on a multitude of committees\nas your representative.\nI think the opinions I hold are in line\nwith that of the average student and in\nhaving no strong political bias my views\nwill not in any way inter fer with the job .\nI would imagine that most of you have\nprobably been to one or more of the\nevents organised by the Ents Committee\nand have doubtless formed an opinion of\nmy organisational abilities even if you\ndon't like the Heavy Metal Kids. As Ents Chairman apart from gaining experience\nin dealing with the cut throat business\nworld I have also spent a great deal of\ntime in the union office and have come to\nappreciate the problems involved with\nthe post of Hon . Sec. Let me conclude by saying that if I am elected, I am elected to represent\nyour views and interests, which I will do to the best of my ability. If you do not\nthink I am suitable for the post please\neither vote for another candidate or\nwrite abstain on your paper, but for the\nUnions sake PLEASE VOTE! Editor of FELIX CANDIDATE: PAUL EK PEN YONG PROPOSER: KEITH AHLERS As I wrote in my bump h sheet, FELIX should have more news in it .One way' of\nac como dating this news would be to\nhave It on the back page. In addition I feel there is a need for more feature\narticles and guides, (to appear in the\nfirst few issues of the aut um term),\nwhich help to spotlight the places, in\nthe South Kensington area, where students can get reasonably priced clothes,\nfood, equipment etc. The Editor has an important role to\nplay as coordinator of IC media and I would cooperate fully with them, in\nutilising all available means at our disposal to improve the service we provide.\nMore coordination is required on the\nproduction side, so that more time can be spent on editing and layout design. This would help to improve the quality\nof FELIX. I intend to deal with this problem by getting more staff.\nTo overcome the acute shortage of\nstaff that now exists, I would try to negotiate for more places in hall for FELIX staff. This would not only serve as an\nincentive for recruitment purposes but\nwill also allow FELIX more coverage of\nIC news as and when it occurs. With the experience I have gained\nworking on FELIX this year I think I am\nthe person most suited for the job. As Editor I shall work hard and be avail able ALL of the time (you can't miss the fuzz!) .\nI shall be available in my room (Gar-den 43) or Maths department if anyone\nwants to discuss further, the issues I have raised . Please make sure you\nexercise your right to VOTE.\nCANDIDATE: CLIVE DEWEY PROPOSER: STEVE BRIGHTMAN Since coming to IC Clive Dewey has\nbeen heavily involved with the media\nhere. In his first year he was a FELIX photographer as well as a producer/pre-s enter for STOIC. In January 1974 he\nbecame a founder member of Imperial\nCollege Radio, for whom he is now a Station Manager.\nOlive's main interest this year has\nbeen the student press. He started the\nyear as an Assistant Editor of FELIX, but soon moved on to SEN NET. Here\nhe has played an active part in the News\nand Advertising departments . This term\nhe has written regularly in both the reviews and features sections of the paper.\nClive therefore has a good deal of\nvaried journalistic experience, which\nwill stand him in good stead if he becomes FELIX Editor. As Editor C live's first priority will be to improve the news service. News\nwill be geared more to IC, be more ac curate and strictly factual. Improvements\nwill not stop there; Clive intends starting a weekly four page What's On pull "

Finally the opposition\narrived but with only eleven\nmen, two volunteers were asked to play for them and R. Sutton and G. Davies did the honours .\nThe game was more a run\naround for most of the game\nwith IC scoring continually.\nAlthough at the start of the\nsecond half Old Sultonians\nput up a fight.\nThe final score was 82-10\nfor IC (half time 40-6)\nScorers were:- S.

Chudy\nso ec rfc The semifinal of the U.L U. premier league cup between Imperi al College l st XI and Kings College IstXI took place finally at\nHadington on Wednesday the 19th. I.C. hoping to make it a double\nfinal date at Motspur Park, already having their second team through in the reserves cup, fielded a full strength side and started\nthe game clear favourites.\nUnlike their league encounter a fortnight ago, our\nlads refused to let Kings dominate the midfield in the opening stages but harrassed continually and forced the opposition to squander their posse s sion on many occasions.\nOur attacks were not very\nfrequent but we were content\nfor the time being to con soli date our position at the back\nand allow the Kings middle\nmen to tie themselves out\nwith fruitless running. Inspite\nof this the best chance of the\nhalf still came our way when\nGlen Swaby chipped a brilliant free kick over a defensive\nwall at the edge of the penalty area for Steve Bates to\nrun onto. Making a tremendous\nlunge for it, however, he was\nonly able to hit the ball wide\nwith just the keeper to beat.\nThe first half thus ended as it had started, really a stalemate all round.\nThe second half was a differ ent story for both sides came\nout determined to make the\nvacant place at Motspur Park\ntheirs .IC attacked solidly for\nthe first ten minutes but could\nfind no way through a well\ndisciplined defence and it\nwas eventually left to the\nKings full back to break the\ndeadlock. With the ball at his\nfeet he ran a full 30 yards unchallenged towards the IC defence before letting fly\nfrom well outside the area. The whole IC side stood rooted to watch the ball loop into\nthe far comer of the goal giving Kev Allen no chance.\nHaving been behind on\nseveral occasions this season but still succeeding in\nwinning we picked up our\nheads and decided we were-n't going to lose without a fight. Our midfield men began switching the ball from\nleft to right and sending in\nsome wicked crosses for the\nKings defence to deal with.\nGlen Swaby then hit across an\ninch perfect cross ball to\nBruce Woodman who nodded\nthe ball past the Kings keeper to put us back in the\ngame .\nAnd so the score remained\nfor the next twenty minutes\nuntil a minute from time,\nwhen everyone had resigned\nthemselves to an extra half\nhours play, up popped the\nKings contre half to shoot\nfrom the edge of the area and\nput his side into the final for\nthe first time for years.\nHOCKEY\nIC IS T XI vs ASHFORD1 ST XI After our recent successful run, IC travelled out to Ashford\nlast Saturday confident of yet another victory. Unfortunately things\ndidn't go according to plan. A bad dose of plague kept Captain\nStitch in bed (at least that's what he told us) and this left us with\nout an umpire. Luckily Ashford were able to provide an extra um-pi re!! After the usual democratic procedure the \" Fu hrer\" took over as captain for the day\nand the match began on time.\nIC quickly found themselves a goal up when a through ball\nfrom Adolf was picked up by\nSuperstar and his shot was\nkicked off the line by an Ash ford defender. Mr P.F. himself\nnon cha lent ly converted the resulting penalty. After this early\nsetback Ashford exerted a great\ndeal of pressure with ou f ever\nseriously troubling the IC de-fence. However, just before\nhalf time a mis-hit shot fooled\nthe IC defence and trickled in to the net for Ashford's equal-is er. The second half continued\nthe same way as the first with\nAshford applying most of the\npressure without creating any\nclear-cut chances. The best\nchances fell to the IC forwards\nbut unfortunately too many mistakes were made with the final\npass. Mid-way through the half\nAshford scored what proved to\nbe the winning goal when an other mis-hit shot trickled over\nthe goal line . Despite applying\nsome sustained pressure in the\nlast few minutes IC could not\nforce an equalise r. The whole IC\" defence played extremely well particularly\nboth full backs, Jim Marshall\nand Mike Vieyra . However, the\nmidfield concentrated too much\non defence and, as a result,\nnot enough support was given\nto the forwards who when given\nthe chance tore the Ashford defence apart.\nSpecial thanks must go to\nRichard Cameron who came\nalong to spec tate.

With vague remembrances of goals galore in our\nprevious match the team were\neager for further glory.\nThe enthusiasm at least,\nwas still apparent in the opening 35 minutes with IC rampant\nin attack, supported ably in mid field,( especially F.T an whose dextrous stick work left\nthe opposition standing).\nThe defense was seldom\ntested, but was nevertheless\nefficient when called upon. No goals came for all the effort\nthough, although Andrew Brewster went close (good to have\nyou back Andy). Chas Hardy\nstruck some useful short com ers, but was denied even the\npenalty flick which he de ser v ed.\nJohn Huckle opened the\nsecond half with a demonstration of how easy it is to get\nones stick caught between\nones legs. (Next time you might give the performance outside the ' D' John). The umpire\nappreciated the display as did\nthe opposition when they\nscored from the resulting penalty corner.\nAfter this IC appeared to\ngive up and the pressure was\ntaken off the Ashford defense.\nIC were unlucky not to be\nawarded a penalty flick, two\npenalty corners and countless\nlong corners, but then we cant\nbe perfect can we umpire?\nMany thanks to all those\nwho played out of position\nwithout grumbling, especially Shane Mead.\nScore IC2 nd X r0 Ashford \" \" I Team: S.

The concepts\nof the Superman and the will to\npower are psychological concepts and have nothing to do\nwith 'might is right' .\nNietzsche was one of the\nearly existentialist philosophers and it was his misfortune\nthai the Nazi es picked on his\nworks to distort and provide\nthe background to their policy, the pia might as easily have\npicked out K Marx .\nYours sincerely\nT..1.D. Pye Chem. Eng .1\nPhysics Department,\n23rd Fehrutary 1975.\nDear Sir,\nMr. Campbell's letters on the\nphilosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche cannot be allowed to\npass by without a few comments\nfrom someone who-is reasonably\nfamiliar with the writings of this rem arable German thinker.\nThe writings of Nietzsche have little to\ndo with class or with race and\nto describe him as a proto-Nazi\nis a gross over-s implication. Certainly, as Bertrand Russell wrote in1943, Nietzsche was,\nwith Fichte and Rousseau, a\" progenitor\" of Nazism, in\nthat he advocates a semi-rigid\nclass structure dominated by an\naristocracy ( cons i sung of a union of \" tough and virile\nelements\").\nCertainly, Nietzsche contributed to the melting pot of\nmost philosophy out of which\nthe twisted ideas of Fascism were to emerge - but so did\nthe writings of many other phi 1-o sophie rs. So why choose Nietz sche, why not condemn Hobbes, the advocate of absolute\npower, or Pla so, who advocated\na far more rigid class structure\nthan did Nietzsche?\nObviously Mr. Campbell\nthinks of the \"Uhermensch\" in the same way as did the Nazis, as a master race . This is rub-b ish, to put it bluntly, since\nthroughout Niet z sch is writings,\nwhile many things are difficult\nto interpret (especially in \"%jar-c thus ira\") it is always clear\nto the objective reader that the\n\" Ubermensch\" is a moral being. Indeed, Nietzsche strongly condemns the \"breeding\" of men\nor any other creature, since\nsuch tampering, he thinks, can\nonly cause harm to the species. And where is the relevance of\nhis \"social stratum\", since his\nviews are entirely opposed to\nthose of the contemporary German mo role class, whose morals\nand religion he continually condemns (eg, in \"the Anti-Christ\")?\nThe \"blonde beast\" is a term\nintroduced in the \"Towards a Geneology of Morals\" and ref r ers to the animal aspect of man,\ndominant in the Dionysia n, and\nexemplified by the Homeric\nHeroes. He sees the culture of Ancient Greece as the sublimation of aggression, and the cul ture of recent times as the result of Christianity, which has\ntamed or suppressed the blonde\nbeast. This must not be confused with Zarathustra's beast, the\nState, which he condemns as strongly as the Fascists praised And this is the lie\nwhich creep eth out of the mouth\nof the beast - I, the State, am\nthe people\" - I quote here from\nmemory).\nFurthermore, his viewpoint\nis anti-Christian rather than\nanti socialist. Indeed, he has\nvery little to say about social ism, except to condemn the\nsocialist for blaming his misfortunes on society when the\nfault is primarily his own\n\"liu r light of the Fools\" ch34 Finally, his views on race\nbear no resemblance at all to\nthose of the Nazis or the National Front, he describes the\nGermans as\" a people of the\nmost tremendous mixture and\nmingling of races\". Does Mr .\nCampbell believe that Hitler shared this view? Nietzsche goes on to condemn the nation-ali stic and racial prejudices of\nhis countrymen as \"attacks of\nstupid i dy\" and describes the\nfears as \"the strongest, toughest and purest race at present\nliving in Europe\" - according\nto Mr. Campbell's hypothesis,\nthe logical conclusion for Hitler, if he was indeed a disciple of Nietzsche, would have been\nto choose the Jews as his master race.\nYours faithfully,\nDerrick Everett\nImperial College\nFebruary 1975\nDear Sir,\nI feel that I must protest at\nthe picketing of the N.F. meeting on Wednesday. Having been\nunable to stop the N.F. booking\na room, the Socialists obviously decided to make it very em-baras sing for anyone of whatever politics to attend. Not only\nwas it necessary to push through a large body of people,\nbut also to be subjected to somone taking flash-photos of all people entering the meeting.\nNot satisfied with that, photos\nwere taken through the glass door of the N.F. meeting .\nI was amazed at the way\nthe meeting of the joint Committee against Ras c is m and\nFascism was conducted. This seemed to consist of a dialogue between various left and extreme left members of the Union. It looked rehearsed - had it been,\nor does it come naturally after\nmany similar meetings? One\ncommunist would ask a question\nand another wp ul d answer. This seemed the general case apart\nfrom one or two diversions such\nas demands for apologies from\nFELIX etc. It makes a change to have\nsome political act iv its a tI.C, it is a pity that it has to be of\nsuch an ab noxious form .It must\nhave left a number of people\nwith a sick feeling in the\nstomach .\nYours Sincerely\nPhilip Ide\nTHE BACON FOUNDATION: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT The Foundation oilers a financial prize to the first student in\nRELATIVISTIC ASTROPHYSICS\nHIGH ENERGY PARTICLE PHYSICS\nMATHEMATICAL COSMOLOGICAL MODELS\nGEOMETRODYNAMICS\nASTRONOMY\nASTRONAUTICS\nOr an} related discipline, who can solve a challenging problem concerned with the feasibility of instantaneous interstellar flight\nThe problem:\nAccording to current theory, rotating black holes are the actual gateways to\nother regions in spacetime. How therefore could a space vehicle pass through a rotating black hole into another region of spacetime without being crushed by\nthe gravitational field of a singularity?\nAny solution or theory offered should not only account for present relativistic phenomena,\nhut forecast new observations and suggest experiments ultimately leading to practical\nengineering solutions.
