    "content": "6 FELIX Sports News IMPERIAL GAMES, 1956\nSPORTS DAY\nOnce again Sports Day was held at Hotspur Perk and the\nA.C.C. are to be congratulated on picking one of the hottest\ndays of the year. The standard of athletics was a little\nhigher than last year and nine of last years winning performances were bettered. It seemed to be an unlucky year for the\nholders of the various trophies as all but four changed hands.\nThe day started with the Guilds in the lead by virtue of\ntheir win in the Three Miles, held last term, and throughout\nthe day they never lost this lead and they won comfortably by\n149 points to R'.C.S. Ill and Mines 94* The first race the 120\nyards hardie s was won by Dlok Bond of R.C.S. with high jumpers\nand Riokard in 2nd. and 3rd. positions. The a porta Interesting from a spectators point of view because\nof the number of thrilling finishes to the rao es. In the\n880 Les Locke, the oo lle ge record holder, won by inches from\nJohn Conway and in the 220 yard H.C Finaent just managed to\nhold off Hbbson and Goodwin to win the most exciting rao e of\nthe day. The one mile was a win for John Evans in 4 min.\n19-6 sees, which is a new \"Sports Day he st Performance\", and\nin this race interest was held by the battle for second place,\nbetween Bill Fain and Chas Cotter!11 the latter just winning\nby 0.1 a eo a. In the field events it was Phil Toynbse'a day as he won\nthe Discus, Shot, and Hammer and was 3rd. in the Javelin and\nhe ia to be congratulated on soon a fine performance. Mike\nRiokard won the High\"Jump at 5 ft. 11 ins. and John Hobson\nthe Long Jump at 20 ft. 8^ ins. R.C.S. provided two surprises\nwhen B. Shenkel, a student from the Swiss Federal Institute\nof Technology at Zurich, won the Pole Vault and J. H. Hockey\nwon the Javelin.\nThe Tug of War provided the unusual sight of the Guilds\nbeing beaten by both the Mines and the R.C.S. and as..the\nR.C.S. beat the Mines in two straight pulls they won the\nInoognitua Cup.\nIn previous years I.C. W.A.'s main role at Sports Day has\nbeen to sell programmes but this year were determined to\ntake part and they arranged an invitation relay. Teams from\nKings and B.C. accepted the challenge and the result was a very good rao e. Maureen Hawea ran the first leg and handed\nover to Pat Carr who went flying down the back-straight to\na end Jean Huston away with a two yard lead, Jean held on and\nBrenda Walker brought the team home to a comfortable win.\nThe Miners had been toiling all afternoon in search\nof an elusive first place so it was rather fitting that they\nshould win the last rao e of the day,]the sprint relay. This\nrao e like so many of the others provided a wonderful finish\nas Goodwin of Mines passed Mantle of R.C.S. in the very last\nstride.\nThe day ended with the distribution of p rises by\nMrs. Lindstead and the only regret one feels on looking back\non a fine afternoon is that so few students were there to\na har s it. WHITSUN SAILING\nThe I.C. Sailing Club held their annual Helmsman'a Championships at the Welsh harp on Wednesday 23rd May. The event\nwas won by A. Biapham, who in the final rao e, sailed extremely\nwell and fast. J. Conway-Jones and M. Collyer finished 2nd.3 rd. respectively.\nOver the Whitson holiday, J. Conway-Jones took Famulus\ndown to Lakham to rao e far /the Sir Bowse-Sffits Branny.\nThough the wind was fresh, the narrow n iVer and the multitude\nof trees were a handicap to the visiting helmsmen who did\nmat have any local knowledge. J. Conway-Jones was recalled at\nthe start, he pressed on to take the lead during the\nsecond lap and\" win by a substantial margin.\nM. Collyer sailing Faust at the Welsh harp in the Willeaden Begatta was 5th in the trophy for local helmsmen.\nCHISWICK REGATTA\nSat. 26th May 1956.\nCourse: One mile, rowed- from stake boats in the direction\nof the tide.

    "content": "FELIX5 Inside Story\nRecently a survey of opinion m>aa oem the Hostel*\nResidents were asked to indicate whether they had suffered\nunreasonable inconvenience aa a result of noise made by other\nresidents, and whether they thought a recognised disciplinary\nsystem (such as gating or fining) was necessary. Old residents\nwere asked to state whether they thought the noise was worse\nthis year than last.\nOf the 46 residents in the Old Hostel, wh i oh is a notoriously exuberant community, only 5 considered that they bad\nsuffered unreasonable in o on ven leno e, and only 7thought a system of rules necessary. Fifteen did not return their forms,\nbut presumably they cannot be unduly troubled by noise or\nthey would have taken the opportunity of doing something about\nit. Only 2 out of 15 old residents thought the noise this\nyear was worse than last year. It would therefore seem that\nalarmists on the Resident's Committee who advocate a rigid\nsystem of fines have ho grounds for their revolutionary\nproposals.\nThe returns from the New Hostel brought something of a surprise, for although only 6 felt that they suffered from\nunreasonable inconvenience, 14 would like a system of rules.\n'Ibis seems inexplicable stupidity, for surely principle\nnumber one in this matter is that a system of rules should\nbe introduced only under extreme provocation. As many\npeople pointed out, a system of rules may be f iero ely interpreted by some future autocratic warden.\nI. C.W. A, were almost unanimously against rules, and they\nappear to live in total si leno e. They are indulgent about male\nresidents: as one said \"Men will be boys\".\nOther remarks:-\"I'm not a monk. Otherwise I'd live in a monastery.\"\n\"I have been in the Hostel less than a year and have\nfound that it has lived up to my expectations. When I applied I was prepared to live in a more lively place\nthan digs, and therefore also more noisy. I think that\nresidents who want a place that is as quiet as a morgue\nshou d Just get out and make way for someone more adapted\nto Hostel life.\"\n\"The introduction of any regulations in a virtually\nregulation-free hostel is undesirable, especially as they\nmay be differently interpreted by future wardens. Noise\ncan be trace to a small minority of residents. The\ndisciplinary committee was e leo ted to o on tro l discipline,\nand there is no excuse for shirking their responsibility\nof \"o huo king out\" persistently noisy residents. Two\nwarnings should be sufficient\".\nThe game of warden-baiting was unanimously de noun oed 'as\nchildish and in the worst of taste.\nIt is to be hoped that this survey will con vino e the\nResident's Committee that the less rules there are the better.\nThey should abandon their o on temp lat ions of fining and scrap\nthe tepid compromise of gating.\n8\n!\n(3)\nMe tiers Ic l lie^d ii er May 24th.1956.

L.U.o an make use of certain\nfacilities in the twenty Unions listed under \"Ins-ti tut ions having Recognised Teachers\" In the U.L. U. Diary, but in return U.L. does not offer the use\nof any facilities in its new Union Building to members of these Unions - on the grounds that the\nbuilding is already used by over 20,000 students.\nConsequently I.C. is to offer the use of dining\nhalls, lounges, reading rooms and the bar to members\nof the 20 Unions concerned. It is felt that it is unlikely that more than about a dozen students will avail themselves of this offer each year, but that\nthe offer is a very worthwhile gesture in return\nfor the facilities which are available to- all I.C. students at other colleges and Universities.\nWritten application to the Hon. Secretary is required from any outside student wishing to use\nI.C. Union, so that possible overcrowding on special\noccasions, like international match day e can be\navoided.\nROWING AND JUDO.\nA launch is to be purchased for the Boat Club.\nThis will enable the coach to have the best possible chance of training his crew properly v and will\nsurely be heartily welcomed by \"Charles\", who has\nfor many years cycled gallantly up and down the\ntow-path keeping up with the fast I.C. eights.\nNew mats are to be purchased for the Judo Club.\nThey will now \"be able to start off in the New Union on the right foot.\nTHJt NJ B W GYMNASIUM\nThe Cross Country and Boxing Clubs have asked\nCouncil to make a firm ruling that the gymnasium\nwill be used only for athletic purposes, since\ndancing soon ruins a gym for its proper functions.\nCouncil are strongly in favour of this suggestion,\nbut certain problems' arise with regard to the running of hops. It has been decided that the concert\nhall will have to be used in conjunction with the\nthird-floor dining-hall for hops in.the new Union\nBuilding, but it is hoped that Ayrton Hall will still be available for some hops so that the new,\nbuilding will not be subjected to top much wear\nand tear in its first few years of existence.\nIt is hoped that the floor of the. third-story\ndining-hall will be changed to wood strip. Present\nplans are that this floor will consist of phe no glazed wooden blocks, which is not particularly\nsuitable for dancing. However there is still time\nto alter this, and it is the clear duty of the\nUnion Decorations Committee to do so. It is hoped\nthat there will also be a suitable screen across\nthe room to hide the service counter from view\nduring social functions.\nNOT* - Dramatic capers\nThe first production\nin the new concert hall will be a joint effort between I.C. Dramatic Society and the Comus Players.\nEXPLORATION PROJECT\n&am argue, summer1956 The most important-economic item in the world\nis food. Thus the food growing potential of &\ncountry becomes one of the most important for\nexploratory projects. Food both animal and\nvegetable depends ultimately on the plant life of the area. The Camargue JSxpedition will carry\nout an ecological investigation of the flora\nand fauna in that locality.\nLa grande and petite Camargue is a nature\nreserve in the delta of the River Rhone in\nSouthern France. It is naturally divi dod into\nthree regions, the coastal sand dunes, the flat salty area covered by Salicomia grassland and\nan inland forest area which has largely been replaced by farmland.\nAlong the river bank\nitself, a fairly rich\nswampy forest has\ndeveloped. The area\nhas long been noted\nfor the bird population and in particular for the flamingoes which breed there.^\nWild horses and bull L vi are bred there, the\nlatter for the bull fighting in Aries.\nThe expedition\nwill consist of four\nbotanists and seven\nzoologists and will be in the area for\nabout three weeks,\nduring August and the hottest part of the Camargian\nYear. During the visit many of the small lakes in the\narea will have dried up leaving a vast desolate sun-baked area prior to the 'Mistral' winds which blow\nfor days on end and in particular during the latter\npart of the year.\nAlthough all members will be Interested in\nseeing as many of the birds as possible, the work of\nthe zoologists will be more concerned with the in sect fauna. A general botanical survey will be made\nprior to a study of the grasshoppers, x he density of\npopulation in various regions is to be studied in\nrelation to various ecological niches in the area\nwhich are dependent on the climatic factors. While\nthe major work will be a problem of this kind, the\nteam will tackle any other suitable problem suggested\nby the director of the Reserve. The botanists will concentrate on compiling a flora of the area, mapping\nthe vegetation, and carrying out a detailed investigation of the habit al requirements of selected\nplants.\nThe expedition will be\ntravelling by two Austin\ntaxis, the first. apu kka1936 cabriolet and the second now converted to a15 cw t. pick-up. The former\nwill be driven by D. G. Hewitt with U.T. Tanton as\nco-driver, and the latter\nby Len Palmer with.U.B. Sanderson co-driving.\nThe organisation of\nthe expedition has been\nplaced in the hands of a general committee of all nes be rs of La Caaargue\nSociety with N.D. Jago\nHewott Vice-President, G.A. Uathewg Secretary and L.E. Palmer Treasurer. The\nvarious administration al duties have been delegated\nto sub-committees of between two and four members.\nas President, D. G. "

    "content": "FELIX3 Felix The Imperial College Newspaper\n1LS0. VS COIM\nCirculation1200 Editor: BILL HUBSOH\nFELTX is produced by tha Editorial Board, but like\nmost commercial a nter pris as it has a Board of Direotors.\nThese o on s is t of the I.C. executive, i.e. the President\nand Secretary of I.C. Union and the Presidents of the\noost it u ent Colleges, These five are responsible for\nappointing the Editorial staff, but they rely upon the\nEditor for guidance. The newspaper would be useless if it became the mouth pie oe of any group of Union officers,\nso these five take little interest exo ep t in the financial side of the paper, and rely on the Editor not\nto involve the Union in libel suits. By remaining\nfinancially solvent, Felix cannot be accused of biting\nthe hand that feeds it. Next Thursday v/ hen elections -are^held for the\nCouncil and Entertainments Committee positions it would be as well to know the candidates. The constituent\nColleges are not faced with the^diff io ul ties that confront the parent Union when it comes to selecting\nofficers. The Mines is small and active enough to know\nwho is suitable, while the o thar two Colleges have\nbriefs of their candidates lives exhibited. Those\nthat one knows by name may not heo es sari ly be the best\nsuited to positions of responsibility. Empty barrels\nmake most noise. Brian Oggi could easily o ol lect votes since he has achieved publicity, yet he would\nremain the fictitious scape-goat* or eat ed last November to be expelled from the University when the\nSenate threatened students whose actions were pub-li c is ed. The people best suited to I.C. union positions\nwill be those with independence of thought. They must\nowe their alle gie no e to the student body as a whole,\nand not to a crusade sponsored by an outside organ-is ation, and they should be able to reach decisions\nrapidly.\nTo show the interest displayed in the election of\nstudent officers, several stunts have been carried out\nin other universities. By nominating two candidates a for an executive position at Queens College, a group\nof students ensured a ballot. To one they gave a good\nohara c ter,a person who took an active part in Union\naffairs. The other was given the reputation of an\nindifferent person who kept mostly to himself and his\nbooks. The surprising feature was that the poorer\ncandidate polled 40 votes to the others 200. Anootner\nelection is to be held shortly to el eot a living\nperson. At British Columbia, the third candidate in a presidential election got 405 votes. At the declaration\nof the results it was shown to be a poodle,\nIT WAS H0P EL V.I BAT FELIX this week would have taken on a new\nform. Teething troubles at our printers have prevented this\ninnovation. The paper this week has also been pro duo ed under\nsome duress - we are short-staffed as a result of examination\nfever.\nTHOSE PRACTISING for the KARAK OR UM EXPEliITION have been seen on\nnocturnal per am bulat ions round Hyde Park. They have bean burdening themselves with eighty pounds of bricks, filched from\nthe builders and secretly stored on a Hostel balcony.\nSCIENTISTS DISCOVER \"PERPETUAL MOTION\" - C.&(i. Mechanical\nEngineers please note. The fire engine, on its way to Motspur Park on Sports Day, pro oe ede d to accelerate UP n ILL when the driver's foot was not on the accelerator. This\nsort of thing can happen to \"Clementine\" (when she is in\nworking order) due to the complexity of the thermodynamics\ninvolved, but has not been observed to occur with \"Bo\".\nOne feels that the engine of the latter may perhaps be a little out of date.\nEMPLOYMENT, mu oh in the rn in d3 of the Third Year at the present,\nis further spotlighted by the following information: Thomas\nHedley - soap and detergent manufacturers - give all their\ngraduate applicants an intelligence test. They only take\non those who are in the top 2$ grade.\nDIGS IN SOUTH KEN? It is not difficult to find lodgings\nclose to I.C. if one is prepared to \"go from door to door\"\nbut U.L. Lodgings Bureau appear, from an article in\nSENNET, to be contemplating the billeting this year's increased 1.0. intake somewhere west of Ealing - as usual.\nIT WAS REPORTED in the Daily Mail recently that are lio, a Roman Jewel casket inscribed UTERE FELIX, has been unearthed,\nat East Stroke in Nottinghamshire. The inscription means\n\"Use this happily\". One wonders what, 2,000 years hence,\na rohe o logi sts will make of the FELIX Editor's \"pot\" kept\nin the bar.\nEXAMINATION FEVER has o aught Guildsmen who pessimistically\ngreet each other with military salutes\nR.C.S., WINNERS of the TUG-0'- WAR on Sports Day, had\npractised against the shovel-leaning workmen in the Min.\nof Works establishment. MINES had practised against the\nU.S. MARINES (of motion pio ture fame). If the results are\nwr/thing to go by, the Marines, who spend most of their\ntime marching up and down past the Albert Memorial are\nunsuitable for tugging parties.\nIF YOU CAN AFFORD THEM.

It\nis interesting to note that astrology still has a place in\nindustry.\nMBOXtSSS: The staff race is always an interesting attraction\nat Sparta Day but a similar event could be staged for the\nsecretaries, There would then be competition between their\nemployers to see that theirs was the most fit and brought\nback the p rise.
