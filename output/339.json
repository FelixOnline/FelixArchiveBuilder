Although everybody paid their hall fees for last term,\nabout 1,400 are withholding rent for the\nsummer term.\nTwo weeks ago the authorities at\nReading wrote to the parents of all students who had not paid last term's hail\nfees. The letter that i they sent threatened\nthe parents with legal action if the\nmoney owing to the University was not\npaid promptly. Since that letter was sent\nall the money owing from last term has\nbeen paid. In protest against the University' s action, which the President of\nthe Union, Mark Cann, described as\nmoral blackmail, an occupation was\nstarted. However it was discontinued on the first evening after the Vice Chancellor had entered the occupied building\nwith others, to see if any of the people\ntaking part could be identified. Fourteen people were identified and internal\ndisciplinary action is to be taken against\nthem. The Vice Chancellor himself is\nto be judge, prosecutor and jury.\nThe students at Reading are trying to\ndelay the disciplinary hearings until\nafter exams have finished on12 June.\nThey are writing to the secretary of\nthe disciplinary committee saying that\nthe Vice Chancellor is too deeply involved and committed on one side to be\nan impartial judge.\nUniversity regulations forbid a staff\nmember with knowledge of an incident\nleading to disciplinary action to sit on a. disciplinary committee. The students'\nunion believes that the same should\napply to the Vice Chancellor. They feel\nthat someone else should be appointed.\nIf they are successful in delaying the\nhearings they hope to hold a national\nrally in Reading soon after 12 June.\nThey are sending out notices of this to\na'.l student unions.\nArt Colleges\nCampaign\nThe Spring Bank Holiday weekend\nsaw action by art college students, protesting at Government plans for art edu-cation. The art students are opposed to\nthe Delaney Report, and to the raising\nof the entry requirement for the Diploma in Art and Design to two A levels.\nThe Delaney Report, produced by the\nlocal authority pooling committee,\nrecommends a worsening of staff, student ratios of, in some cases, 50 per\ncent. A cut of this size threatens both\nstudents and staff in art colleges. It\nparticularly threatens part time teaching\nstaff at art colleges. Artists often depend\non part time teaching. It is frequently\nthe only way they can eat and practice\ntheir art at the same time.\nTo draw public attention to their\ncase that it is not relevant for art colleges to insist that students have two A levels and that the Delaney Report\nshould not be implemented, various activities were planned and carried out all over the country.\nStudents at Harrow School of Art made a sculpture out of scrap metal\noutside the Harrow civic centre. At Chelsea College of Art and at Maidstone\nstudents engaged in an all night work-in. Petitions were delivered to local authorities by all manner of means, including effigies of Mr. Heath and 60 foot\ndragons at Wolverhampton Polytechnic.\nPortsmouth Polytechnic performed\nst'-eet theatre in the town's shopping\nc:nt re. Where students did not use paper\nas a base for their protest they painted\non the pavements.\nDerby College of Art held a teach-in\non 9 June and the Artists' Union plans\nto hold a conference here at Imperial\nCollege on 23 June, preceded by a demonstration from Hyde Park Corner.\nLondon art college students are hoping\nto be able to take a coffin into the\nNational Gallery this Friday as a further example of their feelings about the\nDelaney Report and the two A level requirement for the D ipAD. Maidstone College of\nArt Exhibition\nFrom19 June to 1 July the walls and\nfloors of the Institute of Contemporary\nArt will be given over to the work of\nstudents at Maidstone College of Art. The ICA believes that the exhibition of\npainting and sculpture will show the immense diversity of the work going on at\nMaidstone. It will stress forcibly that a policy which includes drastic cuts in staff can only result in loss of quality\nand invention. Maidstone is one of the\ncolleges which would suffer badly from\nthe Delaney recommendations. The ICA hopes that the exhibition will be seen as\na fine example of what can be achieved,\nand hopes that the DES will think again\nbefore making 'further cuts in teaching\nstaff.\nAlternative Education\nat Garnett College\nStudents at Garnett College, diss at is field with the way in which they are\ntaught, took over the college for a day\non 7 June. Garnett trains students to be\nteachers in Colleges of Further Education and a Garnett student described the\ncollege as \"one of the more normally\napathetic colleges of education\". A programme of alternative lectures has been\ndevised covering such topics as free-schooling, alternative systems of education and course content. As well as lectures and seminars practical workshops will be running throughout the\nday. Departments of the college will be\nopening up to allow students to try their\nhands at things which are normally not\nincluded in their course. There will be\nopportunities for scientists to attend a music workshop and for musicians to\nturn lathes.\nMore news from Garnett is that Buzz,\nthe student newspaper, is going to merge\nwith the Roehampton Village Voice, a local community paper, on 1 June. The\nunion has approved the move. Buzz is\ntaking a four page spread and paying\nfor its production. This merger should\nhelp to integrate the students more\nclosely into the community and involve\nthe local community more closely with\nthe students. This is thought to be the\nfirst time that a community paper has\nmerged with a student paper.\nInvitations to South\nAfrica and Rhodesia\nnot to be withdrawn\nAbout 300 students demonstrated in Edinburgh on Monday in protest against\nthe attendance of delegates from South\nAfrica and Rhodesia at the congress of the Association of Commonwealth Universities.. The demonstration was timed\nto coincide with a meeting of the court\nof governors of Edinburgh University,\nwhich met to consider its response to\na petition signed by 2,500 people. The petition asked for the invitations to\nSouth African and Rhodesian Universities to be withdrawn. At the end of\nthe meeting the court anounced that\nthey were not withdrawing their invitations. The Edinburgh students say that if\nthe invitations are not to be withdrawn\nthe A CU should find somewhere else to\nhold their congress. Speakers, including\nDigby Jacks, President of NUS, addressed the protesters.\nNo more Sabbaticals\nA working party of the Governors at\nthe City of Leicester College of E duc ation have refused to recommend the appointment of a full time Deputy President. Three Union General Meetings\nhad taken the decision to elect a second\nsabbatical officer and an Extraordinary\nUnion Meeting last week expressed its\ndisgust at the Governors' decision. A motion passed by an overwhelming majority stated:\n\" This Union believes that this decision is completely contrary to the in dependence of the Union as stated in the Articles of Government.\"\nThe Union has decided to campaign\nfor a second sabbatical officer and is\nhoping to be given five minutes speaking rights on the subject at the NUS Emergency Conference on9 June.\nThe Council of Senate at Cambridge\nhave refused to give a sabbatical to any\nofficers other than the President of the\nUnion. A meeting of the Cambridge\nStudent Union last week voted to go\nahead with elections anyway. The finance for another sabbatical officer will\ncome from an extra 7^pa head on the\ncolleges' Cambridge Student Union con-tri but ion. Miss Murray, Cambridge\nUniversity's next Vice Chancellor, is\nstrongly opposed to more than one sabbatical officer. However, last term on the representation committee she\nstrongly advocated three sabbatical officers. A petition is being organised asking her to explain her two faced be-ha vi our. Censorship Protest at\nEdinburgh\nA local trade union branch in Edinburgh has protested to the Edinburgh\nUniversity authorities about the exclusion of an article on homosexuality from\nthe Bulletin, which is the University's official publication. The reason for its\nexclusion was stated to be on the\ngrounds that it was Hot a \"neutral\" exposition of the subject.\nThe article was submitted by Michael Coulson, a member of the university\nstaff. A teach-in on homosexuality held\nat the University was the reason for the\narticle. The protest has been made by\nthe Edinburgh branch of the Association of University Teachers. They believe that to decline an article on the\ngrounds that it is not \"neutral\" is directly counter to any idea of intellectual\nfreedom. The AUT branch in its submission to the University Constitution\nand Structure Committee recommends\nthat \" the way in which the editorial\npolicy of the Bulletin is determined\nshould be reviewed.\"\nProtests against\nPortugalThe Duke of Edinburgh, who flew\nto Portugal on 5 June, was dogged last\nweek by demonstrators charging that the\ntrip marks British approval for Portuguese imperialism. The protests are part\nof the End the Alliance Campaign\nlaunched on 1 May by the Committee\nfor Freedom in Mozambique, Angola\nand Guine. At the Welsh village of\nBryn Siecyn on 16 May about 50 students harassed him when he arrived to\ninspect the oyster beds, and handed him a petition with 350 names protesting at\nthe Lisbon visit. They also staged a guerilla theatre piece on Portuguese oppression of its African colonies.\nIn Scotland the following day he was\npicketed at an Edinburgh club and later\nat a Glasgow club. At the Northsea helicopter base outside Aberdeen he was\nalso greeted by demonstrators. In Lon don women's groups took up the picketing at the Chelsea Flower Show.\nThe End the Alliance Campaign also\nplans pickets outside the 21 Portuguese\nconsulates in Britain on16 June, anniversary of the alliance. The vice president of Frelimo (Front for the liberation\nof Mozambique) will speak at a meeting in Central Hall, Westminster, on20 June. A mass demonstration will be\nheld in London on 16 June when Portuguese premier, Marcelo Caetano, starts\nan official visit to Britain.\nPrincipal Forbids\nNUS Affiliation\nThe Principal of Kettering Technical\nCollege has refused to allow the stud-ents' union to affiliate to NUS. Susan\nMitchell, President of the college union,\nsaid: \" At the moment the union gets\n\u00a3400 a year grant for social functions.\nBut the Principal, Mr. M cK in ely, has\nthreatened to stop this if we join NUS\". Apparently Mr. McKinley' s objections\nto NUS stem from his belief that NUS is only concerned with polytechnics and\nuniversities. He does not believe that\nits activities concern technical colleges\nor further education colleges.\nPresumably Mr. McKinley is not\naware that the focus of the NUS grants\ncampaign has been on discretionary\nawards, which would affect most of his\nstudents. Mr. McKinley said this morn-ing: \" The students talked to me about\njoining NUS. I told them to give me a breakdown of the costs and benefits\nand then I would consider it\". Presumably Mr. McKinley has come to the\nconclusion that the costs would outweigh the benefits to his students.\nJoint Statement by\nNUS and the AT CDE Sabbatical Leave for Union Officers im\nColleges of Education.\nA joint statement by the Association\nof Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education has just been issued.\nThe subject it covers is sabbatical leave\nfor union officers in Colleges of Education. A previous joint statement by AT CDE and NUS was agreed in May1967. At the time it was written no\npresident of a student union in a college\nof education had ever been granted sabbatical leave. The first such leave was\ngranted in1967/8 and has become more\ncommon ever since. The statement by\nthe new working party follows the main\nprinciples laid down in1967, but believes that it is important to review procedures in the light of the last five years*\nexperience.\nIn this five years the question has arisen as to whether a college authority\ncan veto the appointment of a particular\nperson to a sabbatical office. The statement insists that provided the correct\nconstitutional procedures have been\nfollowed the college authorities have no\nright to interfere with a particular ap-point ment. The student's local authority\nand the DES must be informed if a sabbatical position involves an interruption of a course.\nA student officer on a sabbatical year\nmust retain the status of a student subject to the same regulations as other\nstudents. The joint working party recommends that a formal exchange of\nletters should take place between the\ncollege and the student officer elect so\nthat his status is clear and unc on travers i al. It suggests that the sabbatical\nofficer should in his own interests maintain some contact with his academic\nstudies, but that college authorities\nshould not lay down \"formal academic\ncommitments as a precondition for\ngranting sabbatical leave to student officers\". The statement also mentions the importance of adequate finance being provided if the student official is to be able\nto carry out his job adequately. It believes that financial support should be\nmet from union funds to safeguard in dependence and should at the minimum\nbe equivalent to the student grant. Both\nthe college authority and the student\nunion should try to provide the best conditions it possibly can for student union\nsabbatical officers. The statement concludes that \"the contribution which *\ngood student union president can make\nto the relationship between the college\nauthorities and the student union is\ninestimable.\"\n\n"

FELIX Page S Royal\nCircular\nAfter months of growing speculation,\nrumour and denial the engagement has been\nannounced between Mr. Michael Doherty and Mr. Martin Doughty.\nIt must be admitted that the old clich e\" we're only good friends\" was wearing a little\nthin and few people really believed that it was a mutual love of women that had brought them\ntogether.\nCourt correspondent Jonathan Gonad writes: \" The couple are believed to have first\nmet at a gang bang near Olympia. Mr. Doherty,\nknown to his friends as \" dipper\", denies that\nhe took part by virtue of going first. A woman is also believed to have been present though\nseveral eye-witnesses dispute this. Only recently the couple were seen dancing together\nat a Beit Hall party and managed to explain it\naway by using a sub warden as a front.\" As the processional car pulled into Prince\nConsort Road large crowds had to be restrained by police, some armed though many\nlegless. Cries of \" show us your bobby's helm et\" were clearly audible above the cheering\nof the gathering.\nIt is understood that Mr. Doughty may take\na courtesy title. Readers are invited to send in\nsuggestions to the editor.\nMARTIN DOUGHTY\nUP SHIT CREEK\nNOTE:\nWhere quotation marks surround anything that\nMr. Doughty has said, speak it to yourself with\na very nasally, almost puffy voice.\nWhere quotation marks surround anything\nthat I have said, speak it with a firm, masc u line, but not too butch, voice.\nIt'll help you get the picture.\nI was first introduced to Mr. Martin \" how' s your\nbum\" Doughty a couple of weeks before he ran off\nto live with my girlfriend.\nWhen they went to live in Oxford I thought I'd seen the last of him \u2014 not so lucky.\nOn returning to college this year who should I see strolling out of the Union Arch but the coy\nfaced, sore bummed, under worked, over sexed\nMr. G.M. Doughty (didn't you know he has a\"G\" in his name \u2014 doesn't tell many people).\nWell, didn't have time to turn round and pretend\nI'd left my coat back in Chem. Eng., so I just kept\non going, expecting him to call my name.\n\" Oy \u2014 get my David Bowie haircut.\" \u2014 not an unexpected first comment from Mar tin, even though I hadn't seen him for over a year.\n\" Bloody Queen,\" I was thinking.\n\" She wasn't so good after all,\" he was telling\nme . . .\nFrom then on it went from bad to worse, he\nstarted phoning me up, calling me \" his friend\" \u2014\nyou can imagine how horrible it all became.\nPretty soon he was a feature writer for several\nwell-known newspapers \u2014 \" The High Peak Reporter\", \" Felix\", and even \" The Guardian\" once (by\nmistake) \u2014 sending the same articles everywhere,\nhoping for the break.\nI was never sure what he was trying to do in his articles \u2014- so I went round to his flat and ask'SCt\nhim. A long time later when he finally stopped talk\ning about himself and his David Bowie haircut I realized he' d missed the point.\n\" Look,\" I said, \" your articles use information\nthat Paul Foot threw out last year. What do you say about that? \"\nMaybe I would get my answer now!\" Do you like my David Bowie haircut,\" he whinnied. He continued, \" Just bought a new album by\nGeorge M elly \u2014 he writes film criticisms for the\n'Observer' and plays the sax. with at rad, jazz band\nHe's great and he's my hero.\n\" I'm learning sax. now too. D'y wanna hear me play, Mike. Do you..?\" And so it went on. Painful.\nAfter three hours in his flat I realized I'd spent a whole evening with a bunch of shining wits. I refer\nyou to Prof Spooner.\n1 don't often write in \" Felix\" \u2014 and it may be\nrumoured, therefore, that this article has been written in revenge for certain references, made in Mr Doughty's column, about me taking part in a gang-bang in Olympia. That is absolutely not the reason\n\u2014 in fact it couldn't be further from the truth. Iam writing this article out of complete boredom Wi#i revision and the fact that Mr. Doughty continuously\ntakes the piss out of me in his banal, self-indulgent\nasinine and completely trivial articles is of no interest to me whatsoever.\nBesides, what'sagan g bang? Anyway, enough said. Don't want to go on tog\nmuch. MIKE DOHERTY( absolutely no relation]\nHARROD$ Mid\nIN THIS PART TWO ARTICLE I WANT TO EXPLORE THE WAY IN WHICH THE LARGEST AND MOST LAVISH STORE IN EUROPE FUNCTIONS. THE MYTH IS THE WIDELY HELD BELIEF THAT HARRODS IS A VERY DIFFERENT STORE THAN ANY OTHER; THE REALITY IS THE CONDITIONS AND HIERARCHY UNDER WHICH THE STAFF HAVE TO WORK.1. THE MYTH If you ever look at the\nadvertisements on the sides\nof London buses, chances\nare you've seen the \" HARRODS STOP... EVERYTHING LONDON... STOP.\" The widely held\nbelief which this is aimed\nat propagating is that at\nHarrods of Knightsbridge,\nSW1, Ltd. you can buy\nliterally everything. The\nLondon guides to incoming tourists say just that.\nIt is not true.\nAs the House of Fraser,\nHarrods parent company,\ntheir ever soaring profits\nhave sought to increase\n(Sir Hugh Fraser is Guardian businessman of the\nyear) they have been relentlessly pruning the store\nof any sections which are\nnot geared to maximum profit. A few remain, for\ninstance the bank and the\nzoo, but only because, in\ntheir very different ways,\nthey are both great crowd\npullers. Over the past few\nyears, however, the following low yield departments\nhave disappeared:\u2014\nKey Cutting\nHeel Bar Post Office (not even a posting box now).\nThe banking hall has\nmoved up to the fourth\nfloor from the more convenient ground level to be\nreplaced by a large and\nvery profitable perfumery\nsection.\nThe lounge, daytime\nsleeping quarters of the\nold Knightsbridge dears\ncomplete with trailing furs\nand mini-dog has moved\nfrom the ground to the\nfourth and the library has\ngone to a remote corner\nof the third, lost amid the\ngigantic beds and four\nposter baths of the furniture department. The latest victim is musical in-strum ents. Clarinets, violins and trombones were\nall half-price in the January sale only because the\nsuper-store was getting\nrid of them all and now\nonly deals in pianos, plus\nguitars and recorders now\nin the toy department.\nAnd what of the Harrods customers? Typically,\nHarrods customers, or, at\nleast, the ones that matter\nto the House of Fraser,\ncan be divided into two\ntypes: Rich inhabitants of\nSW1 and other such postcodes and rich inhabitants\nof USA and other such\ncorruptions. The latter of\ncourse seasonal and im pressed; the male the larger of the species sporting\nphosphorescent green chequered suit and exhibiting a hang-up about\ntoilets:\n\"Say Mack. Where's the\nbathroom?\" whispers Wil bur.\n\" Do you want to buy\none or use one?\"\nThe former are resident\nand bemoaning the Harrods of late. Many repeatedly claim they are\nclose relations of the\nQueen and, therefore, deserving of better and all\nappear to have little sense\nof direction as they are delivered by taxi, pointed in\nthe direction of the lifts by\nthe green man at the door\nand pointed towards the\nrequisite department by\nthe lift man. \"Does this lift go to\nChina?\"\" No. It just goes up and\ndown.\" No marks for\nguessing who said that.\n\" Can I bring my dog\nup?\" Words fail.\nWhen there's a sale on\n(and Harrods sales do\nhave the odd bargain) the\nregular customers try and\nmake out that they\nwouldn't have come if they'd known \u2014 despite\nthe place being plastered\nwith SALE posters and\nten times the number of\npeople inside.\n\" Good grief! It's awfully crowded today, is\nthere a sale on or some-thing?\"\n\" Yes.\"\" I thought there were a lot of those dreadful eastenders about the place.\"\nThat was a guy about\nthirty!\nThe Harrods customer\noften appears to have\nmore money than sense,\nlikes a record cover and\nbuys the record for the\nHon. James who doesn't like it and it gets sent\nback. The Harrods bureaucracy is appalling. Tt\nmay take a letter sent to\nthe store a week to get\nthrough to the right de-partment.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX June 12th,1973 GAY STUDENTS COME OUT\nThis article will be read by some who are definitely gay, some who are definitely not, and some who aren't sure. 1 can't write in away that speaks\nequally to everyone, but I hope that gay people\nreading this will put up with my answering a few\ncriticisms first before coming to the main point of\nthe article.\nThat word 'gay' puts me off straight away_. Why\ncan't you be honest and say 'homosexual'.' Or\n'queer'?\nThe words don't mean the same things. ' Queer' is\nderogatory, as in \" you' re just a load of queers\nreally\". I dont' mind using ' homosexual', but it has\nmedical or scientific overtones to it, as in \" Homo sexuality in the ten-spined stickleback\". The thing\nabout each other. It suggests something you can ary thing, that it is an adjective not a noun so that\nit describes feelings and relationships without putting people into boxes, and that it was coined by\nhomosexual people themselves as away of talking\nabout each other- It suggests something you can\nenjoy rather than something to worry about.\nBut it's not ordinary like you say. 'I 've never met\na homosexual, and the ones you see sometimes in\nthe street have very peculiar mannerisms, they're\nnot ordinary at all. There can't be any to speak of\nin I.C. You've probably met lots of gay people without\nrealising it. J7ew homosexual men choose to talk\nlike Larry Grayson, and you probably have no awareness of gay women at all. There are probably as\nmany gay students in I.C. as anywhere else. Some confident and knowing where to go in London for\npleasure, some sitting alone every evening desperately lonely; some enjoying steady affairs, some\nwho can't admit their feeling to themselves, let\nalone to anyone else. Some guiltily pushing themselves into affairs with the other sex, some shyly\nand quietly in love with their best friends. There's no distinguishing mark of gay people exe pt their\nsexual and emotional need of their own sex.\nIf it's as common as you say, why don'tI ever\nsee it?\nBecause we were brought up the same way as\neveryone, to see homosexual feelings as ridiculous,\ninferior, shameful. Although we find out how false\nthis view is, we are very aware of how prevalent\nit is, and we hide our feelings so as not to be\nlaughed at and rejected. It's very easy to lead a double life and pass straight.\nThat's only sense. What's the point of your\nsociety then, won't it make you more laughed at?\nIf I were a homosexual, I'd keep it to myself.\nOne reason why gay people are despised is that\nthey are secretive. Another thing is that people\nare ignorant about what we are like. And we have\nbeen too afraid to stand up for ourselves. Each of\nus has grown up in a world very hostile to our Innermost feelings, and it is often with great difficulty\nand only after long battling with the guilt induced\nin us by parents, school, church and the medical\nprofession that we come as individuals to accept\nand enjoy your homosexuality. Some of now want\nto go further than that, to a ot in away that will make it easier for future generations of gay people\nto discover their sexuality, and also to challenge\nthe discrimination to which we are still subject.\nThis is not something we can do as individuals; the opposition of society is too massive and daunt-ing. The point of forming a society such as the\nUniversity Gay Students' Society is that a little\nmutual support can achieve a great deal. The fact\nthat it exists as a university society like any other\npublicise s the lack of shame and the confidence\nin our value as human beings that otherwise would be known only in our private lives. We have been\nable to arrange openly publicised discos and dances\nfor gay students, and to get a Gay Rights resolution\npassed at the N.U.S. Conference \u2014 things that\nwould have been unthinkable a few years back and quite impossible for an individual to achieve. The university Gaysoc (as it is usually called) is meant\nor all gay people in the University \u2014 it doesn't demand individual militancy or . commitment to a political point of view, but it is based on the idea\nthat it is worth doing something openly to support\neach other.\nYou won't make me a homosexual.\nI don't want to. But our talks and discussions are open to anyone interested in sexual liberation.\nTo gay readers: The L.S.E., University College and King's College have their own Gay socs, and it would be nice to see I.C. follow. If someone took\nthe initiative this term by going through the formal\nprocess of setting up an I.C. Gaysoc then there\ncould be publicity for it in the Freshers' Fair next\nOctober. I can't pretend it's easy coming out and doing that, but gay people in I.C. are promised the\nfull support of the University Gaysoc and the encouragement of the I.C. Union. I would suggest that\nanyone interested should contact us first.\nInformation: Gaysoc has meetings (talks or dis-cuss ions) every Friday in the University Union, at\n7.30 p.m. There is also a dance and a party arranged for later this term. Please write for further\ninformation to The Secretary, Gaysoc, U.L.

CHAIRMAN\nI'M BORED\nOLIVER DOW SON visits the NUS Emergency Conference on Grants.\nThe Grants issue is dead, at least until the start of next year. This was the only\nmessage to come out of the NUS Emergency Conference on Grants held at Imperial College in South Kensington on Saturday. Student leaders now have no clue of\nwhat to do next.\nThe conference was notable among NUS conferences for the poor quality\nof the speeches, the almost\ntotal lack of organisation,\nand the general confusion.\nOf the 800 delegates and\nobservers, less than 400\nstayed to witness the end\nof the 48-amendment,\nseven-hour debate. And the usual camera de rie was\ngone, too. Those that did\nstay rushed off home as\nfast as they could after-wards.\nSuspicions\nIt was the general feeling before the conference;\nindeed, for many weeks\nbeforehand, that it would\nbe a complete waste of\ntime. The suspicions were\nwell-founded. Every suggestion for new forms of\naction \u2014 or. indeed, for\nany action at all \u2014 was\ncrushed, leaving a substantive motion that served only to reiterate policy agreed upon at the Exeter Easter National Conference.\nCampaign\nContinues\nIn brief, the NUS has\nnow rejected the Government's officer as inadequate, and have decided\nto continue the campaign\nin order to attempt to secure the demands at the\ntriennial review, which\nhappens next year.\nThe NUS has made especial demands for the\nabolition of discretionary\nawards, on which no action was taken in this\nya er's interim award, and\nmarried women students'\ngrants. The government\nhas already promised revision of married women's grants next year.\nMass Action\nConference, hardly sur-pri singly, is convinced\nthat mass action is the\nonly way to win a grant\nincrease, and the motion,\ncontained this gem under\nthe heading of 'Campaign\nPhilosophy.'\n'Conference realises\nthat the foundation of effective mass action is the\ncommitment and understanding of the student\nbody. Conference is fully\naware of the magnitude of\nthe task of building the\ncampaign from the start\nof the academic year.\nConference envisages a steady escalation of the\ncampaign during the autumn term as a consciousness of the issues involved is developed within the student movement.\nConference recognises\nthat building such a firm\nbase is an essential part\nof a campaign that will\nhave to be sustained\nthroughout the year.\"\nThe only problem\nwould seem to be that although they are \"aware\nof the magnitude of the\nproblem\" they have no\nway of solving it. Rent\nstrikes are to continue\nand be stepped up where\npossible, and this is the\nonly action now en visa g ed. One speaker warned\nagainst \"turning rent\nstrikes into a religion\"\u2014\nbut conference did not\nCOUNCIL D&D Friday 22nd June 1973\n7 for 7.30 p.m. Union Building Bar extension until 3 a.m. \u00a32.25 Single\nEverybody welcome (not just Council)\nTICKETS FROM HON. SECRETARY I.C. UNION heed his words. Militant\naction, such as sit-ins. a National Occupation\nWeek and other \"unspecified militant action\" was\ndecided against by a crushing majority.\nBoring\nBut, assuming you\nknow what's happened\nthis year. I need hardly\ncontinue. If you've been\nreading the student press\nthis year you will be as\nbored with the grants\ncampaign as conference\nwas on Saturday.\nCome December. Margale Annual Conference\nwill be upon us. Then\nthere should be some decisions and some new\npolicy. It won't be in the\nmiddle of exams, and delegates will be in a conference mood in familiar\nsurroundings. Until then,\none can hardly expect the\ncampaign to get off the\nground \u2014 and by December (say January before\nanything gets going) it will\nprobably be too late.\nStudents of London, if\nyou want a grant increase\nfor 1974/5, you'd better\nlay your faith in the Government. The NUS won't do much for your cause.\nReds take\nover IC Union\nBuilding\nMany an old l.C. student will turn in his grave this\nsummer. From July 21st to 29th the Unin.\nBuilding will house some 300 left wingers discussing\nthe Marxist view of everything from Economics to Art and Design.\nThe students of the 5th Communist University of\nLondon will have two complementary aims.\nFirstly they will work out their criticisms of the prevailing bourgeois thinking which, consciously or unconsciously, underlies most academic teaching of every\nsubject in the Western world today.\nSecondly, they will regard Marxism, not as a dry,\nbook-learned dogma from the past, but as a living\nguide to action in the present day. They will be discussing and developing Marxism themselves.\nStudents of the Communist University can attend: 1\nSpecialist Course from the following: Art and Design.\nEconomics, Education History, Law, Literature, Philosophy, Science and Technology. Sociology or an \"Intro-duc tory Course on Marxism.\" Plus 1 General Course from: Marxist Philosophy.\n'Marxist Economics, The State and Class struggle, Imperialism.\nIn addition there are lectures on The Marxist Approach to Philosophy and History, The Marxist View\nof Man, British Road to Socialism.\nThe course on Science and Technology should especially interest I.C. students few of whom will have\nheard a Marxist viewpoint on the controversies raging\nin the scientific World. To pick out just a few: \"Science\nin Advanced capitalist Society\" \"The Crisis of Man and\nthe Environment,\" \"Technology as a Form of Social\nControl and Domination\"\" Monod s,\" critique of Maxis m\" in choice and necessity and \"The Non-Neutrality\nof Science.\"\nThe left in Britain have a very poor record for working out the theory that underlies their practice. The\nAnnual Communist University aims to change all that.\nIf you want to take part or want to know more contact:\nPaul Watkins, 'Mech. Eng. P/G or John Lane, c/oI. C.

    "content": "June 12th,1973 FELIX Page 3\nPresident's Report\non the year\nAS PRESENTED TO ICUGM\n7th JUNE, 1973\nPresident's Annual Report\nThe essential purpose of a student union must be to\ndefend and extend the rights, the standards of living\nand education of its members. The social, cultural and\nathletic per suits of the Union as well as being very important in their own right bring added strength and involvement to the Union. But the standard against which\nthe Union must measure its success or failure is\nwhether it has tried to improve the lot of its members.\nThere is always a danger that the Union will work\nwithin the limitations of the College and end up with\nits officers simply assisting the College administration\nin its job. \u2014 which is not what we pay sabbatical officers for. Some minor reforms may be made but the\nmajor problems facing students, the continual erosion\nof our standard of living, the accommodation crisis,\netc., cannot be solved without going beyond the confines of this College and challenging Government\npolicy. The political implications have to be faced up\nto.\nThe Union must decide what is needed for its members and then aim to involve them in whatever action\nis ne cesar y to win the demands we are asking. The grants issues has claimed the greatest attention, and\nquite rightly so. The inadequacy of our grants is excluding many potential students from higher education,\nparticularly those from the working classes. It is causing increasing hardship amongst students, and makes\nthe financing of refectories and halls of residence\nchaotic. IC Union, in spite of its not joining the\nnational rent strike \u2014 by a very narrow margin\u2014has\nplayed a very active role with its own demonstration to\nthe DES, joining the London demonstration of February 21st, the refectory boycotts, a bigger strike on\nMarch14 th than J think anyone had thought possible,\nand many thousands of leaflets distributed in the lo-cali ty. Of course, there have been weaknesses. The main\nactivity has come from the left of the Union, with a few noticeable exceptions from the \"moderate\" wing.\nThis naturally weakens our efforts to involve very large\nnumbers of IC students.\ni It was a Tory government in 1962 which considered\nthe undergraduate grant level to be a bare minimum.\nAny right-wing student who wishes to assist the present\nTory government in its glorious mission of solving the\nproblems of Capitalism at our expense would do far\nbetter to send their grant cheque to the London Rhodesia Company (Lonrho) than to hold the rest of us\nback.\nThe concentration on grants has led to a number of spin-offs within the college. I believe it contributed to the freezing of hall rents for next year. We have gone some way towards freezing refectory prices\nand laid the basis for a fight against any increases next\nsession. On field course grants we have achieved an\nimprovement though whether a satisfactory one is not\nquite clear. On post-graduate demonstrating rates negotiation is under way and the PG's themselves are getting\norganised to win their claim for \u00a32 an hour. Again\narising from the activity among PG' s we have achieved\nan insurance cover for ALL students in IC. Another\nimportant spin-off of the grants campaign is the increased contact between the Union and the IC trade\nunions and the Hammersmith Trades Council.\nIn other ways it has been a depressing year. The lack of a sabbatical President in the first term caused a considerable lack of interest by some Union officers\nand especially departmental reps. The number of elections, the non-viability of Northside Hall; vandalism\nin the Union Building all cast a shadow over us.\nBut I believe the small victories we have won,\nshould encourage us to fight for major victories both\nin the College and over the Government next session.\nTo do this will immensely strengthen the confidence\nand support our members give the Union. We have\nmade a start this year which must be built on.\nSee you on the floor of the U GM next year.\nJOHN LANE Oliver Dowsorfs\nIts' strange now to think back\nand realise that, 28 issues of Felix\nlater, I 've only been editing the\npaper for nine months. Mention\nof mine months tempts me to\nplunge forth on a discourse on\nthe growth of the foetus over that\ntime, and that Felix is now ready\nto be reborn, and trash like that\n. . . but I shall resist temptation.\n1 think \u2014 and rather hope \u2014\nthat FELIX changed right from\nthe start. There was a new look\nto it \u2014 not so much a glossy\nnewspaper-size magazine, more a newspaper-sized newspaper, and\na considerable change in emphasis on contents. This year we have\nprinted three times as many\npages as in the previous record\nyear (1970/71). Critics of what\nthey claim to be \" a total lack\nof news in Felix\" may be surprised to learn that news as a percentage of copy carried is up\non last year from (rough estimates\nonly) 1 0 % to 2 5 % and feature\narticles and reviews are down\nby a similar amount. Yes, FELIX could carry more news \u2014 there's lots that goes on that doesn't get\nprinted, and I 've always been the\nfirst to admit it \u2014 but unfortunately no one's ever told me about\nit (or, better still, written about\nit) except on rare occasions. And don't you dare tell me that the\nFelix Ed should KNOW what's happening. One can't( for ex-ample) keep trying to find the\nVolleyball Captain to find out\nif there coach was struck by\nlightning on the Costa Brava last\nweek.\nThus, a plea. If you want more\nnews in Felix next year (I think\nnext year's Editor is planning to\nstep it up anyway) you'd best tell\nhim about anything you hear of.\nI hope you've e noye d reading\nFelix this year. I also hope that\nyou have some practical suggestions for the future \u2014 and as\nyou'll discover on page \u2014 we're\noffering five double tickets to\na West End cinema in return for\nwriting and telling us about them.\nOne temptation I'm afraid it's impossible to resist is to write a post-mortem on the year. For it's been a most curious one, one in\nwhich the credibility of IC Union\nhas dropped more than ever be-fore. Fortunately the constituent\ncollege unions have not strengthened at the same time, or at\nleast not significantly.\nThe fundamental change is in the composition of Union meet-in gs. Not only are there less\n\"communicants\" than ever before \u2014 nearly every meeting has\nbeen on the verge of in quo racy( if\nnot completely in quo rate) from\nthe start \u2014 those going to meetings are of a different ilk. UG M's might as well be re-named Socsoc\nmeetings. It's significant that the\nlatter's stopped holding meetings\nof its own! This has presumably\nhappened for two reasons. Firstly,\nSocsoc have put in so many motions irrelevant to the bulk of\nthe incumbent student body that\nfew can maintain interest. Secondly, only Socsoc members (be-cause of their interest in their\nmotions) can survive the petty\nwaffling s and methods of steering\nthe meetings adopted by Messrs.\nBlack and Jowitt.\nFortunately, the second problem should be solved next year,\nsince the regime then doesn't look\nas if it has a similar proportion\nof ego-t rippers. If a little more\nspice can be added to UG M's, the\nfirst \" problem\"( sorry to call it\nthat, Socsoc, 'cos you've every\nright to put up your motions)\nwon't need to be solved. Every\nmotion \u2014 well, ALMOST every\nmotion \u2014 will get chucked out\nautomatically.\nThe administration has had\npretty severe problems . . . especially that of a lack of President for several months. Obviously 1 must congratulate John\nLane on his work since then, but\nunfortunately his efforts have\nbeen almost exclusively devoted\nto work on the Grants Campaign\nand other national campaigns, at\nthe expense of the coherence of\nthe members of the Union. God\nknows, he's tried to get them involved \u2014 he's the only one who\nhas, really \u2014 but, important issue\nthough it is, grants doesn't seem\nto have won the hearts of the rank\nand file. Basically this college is\nas woolly-minded moderate as\never, and the sheer mention of\npolitics just turns off most people\nNo, I don't know what's going\nto be done about it, but why not\ntry involving everyone in something non-political (like an ICU swim in the Serpentine on the last\nday of i the Christmas term?) and\nslip in a tea spg on ful of the political elixir when they're not look-ins\nI don't really think it matters\nHOW people get involved, as long\nas they do. Next year's hierarchy\nhave got themselves quite a job\nas far as that's involved. I hope\nthat they don't ignore the task.\nQuite honestly, the best way I can see of strengthening IC Union\n\u2014 and I 've wanted to say this\nfor a long time, unfortunately\nno one else ever does in print\nor election manifestos \u2014 is to\nabolish the constituent college\nunions. A relic of the \u2014 thank\nheaven \u2014 long-since-gone days of\nmascot ry, they now serve no purpose other than syphoning off enthusiasm and involvement into irrelevances. Everything the CC U's do \u2014 except fail \u2014 a united ICU can do better. Society is split\nenough as it is without splitting\nICU society into miners, guilds-men and rcs ian s. Whoops! There is one thing the\nCC U's seem to do better . . .\nwell, with more hilarity. And that is Union Meetings. But then,\nsurely ICU could institute the\noccasional totally silly union\nmeeting (don't tell me, they're\nall silly anyway). Just think, if\nyou put together the total attendance at three individual C CU Union Meetings and called it an\nICU GM it would be nearly three\ntimes quo rate! Can YOU honestly think of any\nuseful function that the CC U's perform? Even their rivalry system of rag collections doesn't work \u2014 most other universities\n(and none of them have aCC U system), do far, far better. ICU is probably now one of the\nweakest student unions (bearing\nin mind its size) in the country\n\u2014 certainly in London \u2014 despite\nhaving some of the best facilities\nto draw on.\nI don't think that the weakness\nof ICU hinges on apathy. It's the disease-ridden, consumptive\norganisation that's at fault. I hope something is done about it\nnext year. The year after WILL be too late.\nOLIVER DOW SON P.S. My thanks to everyone\nwho has helped or criticised me\nduring the year, and especially\nto all those who have encouraged\nme sufficiently to last out the\nyear.\nP.P. S. Have a very happy vac \u2014\nI hope you get good eg zam re-sul ts, and that I 'll see you back\nin October.\nP.P.P. S.1 hope you're looking\nforward as much as Iam to seeing the next issue of Felix on October 2nd!i "

I most definitely have done so. I shall be leaving the Union Office for the last time at the end of\nJuly so this treatise will ooze nostalgia for the next\nfew paragraphs.\nMartin's Bit this year has been witty, informative, a mirror of the Union Bureaucracy and factually acc u rate. It has reflected the trend in the College and Union to return to, perhaps, a more traditional style of life.\nMore people, for example, are going to Dinner an Hall now than during the last few years. The interest in mascot ry is brewing again\u2014I can almost see Mike once more sitting on its plinth in the lower lounge. Our sporting clubs are thrashing all opposition and bringing\nback vast numbers of silver cups.\nIt is very difficult to pick out one or two events\nduring the year which are especially worthy of men-tion. I suppose that the profusion of elections stand\nout in most minds but there have been other things:\nevery Union Meeting bar two was closed due to in quo racy, the new Union lounge bar is still not opened,\nPiers Corby n is still wearing the same pullover that\nhe had in my first year. The politics of I.C. Union have\ngone full circle. Piers was president of the Union in1969, his Hon, Secretary, Keith Guy, had been Chairman of both Ents and the Conservative Society. Next\nsession with Norman Sayles in the Hot Seat, shortly to\nbe vacated by Comrade Lane, we are promised a year\nof mode racy; I think Paul Wadsworth must have a few\ncapitalist leanings--I in ts made \u00a31,000 profit this year\n(the money has been spent on a new carpet in Southside\nUpper Lounge).\nI have tried to take as much part in the life of the\nCollege as I could. I realise nobody will believe me\nwhen I say that I have been working so hard for the\nUnion that I haven't had time to find myself a job \u2014\nbut it's true. When M GB leaves I.C., unless something\nturns up in a Micawber-like fashion, he will be un-employed.\nBut enough of this\u2014to business. There are one or\ntwo happenings worthy of note.\nThe Council D&D will take place on Friday, 22nd June, 1973. Tickets, available from me, are only \u00a32.25\ns ach which includes a full dinner, sherry, wines and\nport, a cabaret and a bar until 3 a.m. The Guest Speaker Will be Ian Hogg, Esq., P.C. Miss Linda Creagh, the Union Clerk, is leaving at\nthe end of term to get married. We will be making a small presentation to her to mark her \"retirement\".\nAnyone who wants to contribute should send or bring\nhis donations to me (cheques made payable to I.C. Union). tI am still interested in buying copies of photographs\nof me doing interesting/silly things to show to my grandchildren when I'm rich and famous. This is a serious\nnotice and should not be treated either lightly or with\nsubtle references to Lords Lambton and Jellicoe.\nThe I.C. Union Colours List appears elsewhere in\nFelix. Ties can be purchased from the bookshop. If\nanybody can think of a suitable substitute for a tie\nfor a lady please let me know.\nIam informed by reliable sources that there is a cycle\nthief at large in I.C. Please lock up your cycle when\nyou leave it at College\u2014you know it makes sense.\nJOURNALIST COMP.\nIn 1969 Lady Catherine Pakenham and Miss Gina Richardson, both at that time working ion i the editorial staff of The\nDaily Telegraph Magazine, were (tragically killed in a car\ncrash. They were young, i bul t their enthusiasm and talent\nshowed promise of real achievement.\nThe Catherine Pakenhaim Memorial Trust was formed by\nCatherine'si family and Mends in her memory with the\nspecific aim of encouraging other girls who are already\nworking, or seriously intending to work, in journalism by\noffering a substantial prize or prizes to the winners of an annual competition.\nPrevious winners of Ithe Catherine Pakenham Memorial\nAward are in emphatic agreement that the prestige was\nof immeasurable help in their i careers.

Runners-up ito previous Award winners were\npresented with. \u00a310 book tokens. The prize money must be\ns pen lt toy the winners in furtherance of i their journalistic\ncareers.\nVAC INVOLVEMENT\nDear Editor,\nWe are wondering if you would be so kind as to include\nthis letter in your newspaper or magazine, in order, perhaps,\nto ca!tch those wavering beings who have not yet decided\nhow ito spend their summer vac?! 'The Foreign Legion is dead'. But there ARE alternatives\nfdr a true hero or heroine Of Modern Adventure. Why not\ncome and spend your summer working with The Cyrenians?\u2014\nthere are now Cyrenian projects in many cities and towns\nthroughout England and Scotland.\n'The Cyrenians exist to care for uprooted, socially isolated\npeople who have nowhere to go. In the case of the single\nhomeless person the most needy are often rejected or repulsed\nby Ithe existing facilities; The Cyrenians try to reach those\nfor whom no adequate provision exists, or who refuse to\naccept certain kinds of existing help.\ni( They therefore set up projects, which may differ according\nto ji the local need\u2014which is, perhaps, for a night-shelter in Which there is food, overnight accommodation, and the offer\nof companionship; a second-tier house; or a third-tier, long-ten m residential house. Cyrenian houses are small and in formal, functioning as communities and not as hostels, and generally offer no special is ation wal th one particular 'problem'\ngr|o up or is ex. Ideally, our residential communities accommodate about 10 residents along with i two ori three workers,\nalthough a shelter will have larger numbers. Worker identification is strong\u2014Cyrenian workers live alongside the residents and share the life of Ithe house in all respects, getting\nthe same pocket money as a man on Social Security would\nhave. The idea of resident participation is also vital\u2014residents are asked to co-operate in the running of the house\narid participate in the weekly house meetings.\nWorkers normally come for a period of between six and twelve months, but we also need people for short-term periods\nof between six and twelve weeks in i the summer.\n'pf you are interested in finding out more write to; The Cyrenians. 13 Wi-n cheap, Canterbury, Kent.\nYours sincerely,\nANGELA CREED, Administrator.\n\n"
