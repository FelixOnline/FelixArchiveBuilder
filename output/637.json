    "content": "continued from page 9\nUnfortunately, while Tolkein's work was one\nof unparalleled imagination which will probably\nendure for ever, this story lacks the utterly\nconvincing depth of the other. Obviously\naimed at children, would even they feel\ncheated by the paucity of the script? There's no real challenge for Jen, the Gelfling charged\nwith reuniting the crystal and shard. A few\nblundering attempts by the Garthim and a rather unlikely ally in one of the Skeksis who\nplays a Gollum type role, but for no apparent\nreason, don't seem to have their heart in\nit at all.\nThat apart, it is a visually sumptuous film,\nthe Skeksis and Mystics are very well done,\napparently by a combination of man-in-a suit, radio control and control lines. This is a mystical bewitched land; the undergrowth is\nliterally alive, and strange creatures lurk\neverywhere. Fortunately, before anything\nreally nasty befalls our hero, he bumps into the\nonly other surviving Gelflin who has learnt the\nways of the creatures and plants. Thus we can\nrelax and enjoy the splendid special effects.\nYou can see where all that time and money\nwent to; the undergrowth scenes are\ngratuitously full of animated goodies.\nOne is left with the feeling that Henson and\nOz are masters of their craft. All they need is a good scriptwriter to harness their undoubted\ntalents and they'd have a blockbuster to knock\n^ \u2022 REVIEWS! ET into the proverbial cocked hat It seems\nstrange that a man as shrewd as 1 cw (.\"na de should allow a film ot such un realised potential\nto be released. Perhaps he was content to let\nHenson have his head as reward tot the\nMuppet movies.\n/ cc Paddon\nAughra -another lookalike contest?\nTheatre\nLe Cirque Imaginaire created and\nperformed by Victoria Chaplin and JeanBaptiste Thierree, Whitehall Theatre.\nNear the outset of Le Cirque Imaginaire,\nJean-Baptiste Thierree blows bubbles and with\na hammer proceeds to burst each one. A sonorous 'ping' of a bell accompanies the burst\nof each bubble. The effect appears magical\nuntil M. Thierree gradually reveals a small bell\nattached to his belt. These bubbles of illusion\nhumourous ly burst by a gentle tap of reality\nare typical of the style of M Thierree's delightful and charming entertainment.\nOriginally designed for the Avignon Festival\nin 1971 by M Thierree and his wife Victoria\nChaplin (one of Charlie Chaplin's daughters),\nLe Cirque Imaginaire has gone from strength\nto strength. The show's triumph in Paris in\n1978 led to its first appear n ce in London at the\nRiverside Studios in 1979, and after a very\n[ \" J F Victoria Chaplin flying high in Le Cirque\nImaginaire\nsuccessful run at the Bloomsbury Theatre\nover Christmas it has now transferred to the\nWhitehall Theatre.\nLe Cirque Imaginaire is indeed an 'imaginary\ncircus' or a circus of the imagination. It is\nimaginative rather than clever and the evening\nwitnesses a kaleidoscopic array of quick tricks,\nmagical illusions and physical feats. The\nAvignon show originally had no less than thirty\nperformers, but since then the act has\nundergone quite a process of slimming, the\nshow now consists of four, the Thierees and\ntheir two children, but with an enormous\nnumber of props, chiefly suitcases and\numbrellas, the number of which one has never\nseen. The suitcases, worn but brightly\ncoloured, contain M Thierree tricks, some of\nthem familiar and some not: vanishing-handkerchiefs, disappearing drinks in glasses\nand telephones. His wife is 'cut in two', doves\nand rabbits appear from nowhere. Most of his\nsecrets are humourous ly given away. The\numbrellas, and the costumes attached to\nthem, form a strange people and exotic\nanimals: clowns, magicians, dancers, Chinese\ndevils, courtesans, crabs, giraffes, eagles and\nspiders. Most of these are assumed very\ncleverly by Victoria Chaplin who dances and\nmoves with the grace of a ballerina. Ms\nChaplin also provides a grave and graceful\ncontrast with a series of breathtaking\nacrobatic tricks. She walks on a high wire and\ndoes pretty impressive feats with a rope swing.\nLe Cirque Imaginaire is reminiscent of the\nold travelling players (the Thierrees still travel\naround in caravans) and the Whitehall\nproud c tion is full of spirit. But some of the acts\nare also surprisingly impressive: Ms Chaplin\naccompanies a piece of sacred choral music\nwith an ordinary carpenter's saw (it's so good\nthat one wonders towards the end if this is an\nillusion) and with the aid of stilts an extremely\nlong and slender legged animal strides across\nthe stage like something out of Salvador Dali.\nSome of the animals the Thierrees create are\nin the realm of science fiction. The production\nalso features a singing duck and a toucan, all\nvery good and very original.\nNick Bedding\nPage101 February 18,1983\nSexy Secrets\nSecret Gardens, directed and designed by\nTim Albery, Antony McDonald, Geraldine\nPilgrim and Ian Spink, ICA Theatre, The\nMall.\nThe IC A's Secret Gardens is being\npresented in cooperation with the Mickery\ntheatre, Amsterdam. It was shown in\nAmsterdam before coming here as representative of new tendencies in the British Theatre.\nIt is a very bizarre thing indeed and bears as\nmuch resemblance to 'orthodox' contemporary drama (such as that by Pinter, Schaffer,\nBond etc) as chalk to cheese or Shostakovich\nto Mo/art.\nSecret Gardens is a multi-media piece,\ndrawing upon the four elements of theatre,\ndesign, dance and music. It is primarily visual\n(as are most of ICA's productions) with bodily\nexpression and movement largely taking the\nplace of dialogue. There are seven performers\n(a mixu tre of professional dancers and actors)\nand the resulting mixture of dance and\nmovement with the odd bit of poetry, is stylish,\nsleek and sexy. Losf Jockey players and\ncomposers Andrew Poppy and Orlando\nGough. provide good modern music.\nThe production draws its inspiration from\nFrances Hodgson Burnett's Edwardian\nchildren's classic. The Secret Garden.\nAway from the paradise of the secret garden,\nalong the gloomy corridors of the house on the\nmoors echo darker secrets, cries of despair,\nrage and loneliness. And it is in the darkest\nroom at the end of the largest corridor that a forlorn, unwanted, disagreeable woman finds a crippled, sei fish and tyrannical man. There\nbegins a tale of what women and men do to\neach other in the name of love and in pursuit of\ntheir own secret gardens...\" Burnett's novel is\nan Edwardian children's story but with\n'dangerously adult overtones'. The ICA\nproduction moves beyond the childhood of the\nnovel and explores fantasy and obsession in\nthe adult world and what people do to each\nother when in pursuit of their own 'secret\ngardens'.\nThe adults in the production are chic and\nsophisticated artistic types after money, sex\nand drugs hut unh sc one is versa nt with the\nbook, this piece of \"is nal theatre is rather\nbaffling. It is certainly never boring or dull to\nlook at but it doesn't exactly accost one's heart and mind. It ends up looking like a bizarre work by London Contemporary Dance\nor even Pina Bausch, but with little of their\nemotional or intellectual panache.\nNick Bedding\nRecords\nBack in the heady days of punk, Howard\nDevoto and Pete Shelley scampered back to\nManchester, having just seen the Sex Pistols in\nLondon, to form the Buzzcocks. They\nreleased the Spiral Scratch EP on their own\nNew Hormones label in 1977, the first of the\nso called 'independents'that were to be born\nin the front rooms up and down the country\nduring the following yea. . The dual catalysts\nof Anarchy in the UK and SpiralScratch would\nsoon result in Manchester turning out the Fall,\nthe Passage, A Certain Ratio and Joy Division.\nDevoto split, to form the excellent Magazine.\ncontinued on page 11\nmmm mmm m^mm mm mm FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Did you know that:\nSince 1978/9 average earnings\nhave risen by 57%; the Retail\nPrice index has risen by 50%;\nstudent grants have risen by only\n39%.\nMost people who have been\n'ordinarily resident' in the UK for three years prior to the\ncommencement of their course\nare entitled to a mandatory\naward for a first degree course.\nThis means the relevant Local\nEducation Authority will pay\nthe student's tuition fees and\nmake a contribution towards\ntheir maintenance. How much\nthey pay depends on a number\nof factors, the most important\nbeing:\nParental Contribution\nUnless you are over 25 or have\nworked for at least three years,\nyour grant will be assessed on\nyour parents' income. For1982/3 the starting point for\nparental contributions remains\nat \u00a3 6 , 6 0 0 leaving the vast\nmajority of students reliant on\ntheir parents to make up their\ngrants. Although it is virtually\nimpossible to avoid having your\ngrant assessed on your parents'\nincome, there is no way that you\ncan force them to pay their\ncontribution if they refuse.\nTHE GRANT GAME\nMinimum Grant\nThe minimum grant for 1982/3\nremains at \u00a3410. This is the\namount you will receive if:\na) your parents' combined\nincome exceeds \u00a321,000 (approx).\nb) your parents refuse to sign\nthe grant forms.\nc) your parents' income for\nthe relevant year cannot at\npresent be confirmed, eg if\nthey're abroad or self-employed.\nBasic Rates of Grants\nMost of you probably realise\nthat the basic full grant for\nundergraduates studying in\nLondon for 1982/3 is \u00a31,900 but\ndo you know what that figure is\nsupposed to cover?\nVacation 8w ks at \u00a323.62\nBoard and lodgings\nBooks, equipment etc\nClothing, laundry & misc\nTravel\nPocket Money\n189\n1249\n165\n105\n50\n146\n\u00a31904\n\u2014 and how to play it\nVacation Element\nThe student grant includes ;in\nelement to cover eight weeks\nvacation at Christmas and\nEaster. For 1982/3 this amounts\nto \u00a323.62 a week which is slightly\nmore than the single person's rate of supplementary benefit.\nThis is why students arc not\neligible to claim supplementary\nbenefit during the short vaca-t ions. However, because there is\nno element for rent included in\nthe grant for the vacations,\nstudents can claim their rent\nback from the DHSS but only if\nthey're living at the address for\nwhich they're claiming. For\nDHSS purposes your income in\nthe short vacations, will be\ncalculated as \u00a323.62 irrespective\nof whether your parents pay\ntheir contribution.\nTravel\nThe grant includes \u00a350 for your\n'travel costs. Any travelling costs\nnecessarily incurred above that\namount should be claimed back\nfrom your Local Education\nAuthority on an excess travel\nform. Theoretically, you can\nclaim for daily travel into\nCollege plus three return journeys to your parental home\nper year by the cheapest means\nof travel. This usually means\nbuying a student rail card in\nwhich case you can claim the\ncost of that back too. However,\nin practice, authorities only have\nto pay what they consider to bke\n'reasonable' and many authorities do set conditions such as\nreimbursement ceilings. The\nStudent Services Office may be\nable to give you some guidelines\nto the particular conditions set\nby your authority but it is\nessential that you check with\nyour authority before running up\na huge t rave bill.\nIn addition to the above there\nare a number of extra allowances\nwhich the authority may award\neg extra money for dependents,\nmature students, or vacations.\nThe Student Services Office has\ndetails of these and a list of\naddresses and telephone numbers of education authorities. If\nyou have any queries or difficulties with your grant then call\ninto the Student Services Office\nand we should be able to help.\nKaren Stott\nWelfare Adviser\nThe Horns of\nUncertainty\n6: Hexasperation\nguilds present's nun* Khia\nBEGINS FRIDRV IBu\nmiDNIGHT*1\n\u2122 \u2122m GUILDS OFFICE Page 21 February 18, 19831 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The 1983 model is a lot more confident, with al our coming up and a new album on RCA\ncalled Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This). As\nwith most duos at the moment, it's basically\nele cl ro pop, but with an above-average mix of\nideas and contrasts, from the down-beat\nJennifer through the new single Love Is A Stranger to the excellent Wrap It up, an\nabrasive funk-up that lyrically explores the\nsame avenue of sexual innuendo that Grace\nJones cruised along when she invited\nlister to \"pull up to the bumper\".\nHis new band never achieved the hits they\ndeserved; a pity, as they were always leagues\nahead of wooden tops like Ultravox. Shelley\nfronted the Buzzcocks until he quit in 1981,\nswopping his star way guitar for a synth, and\nworking with Human League producer Martin\nRushent. The new single Telephone Operator\n(Genetic) is a cracker, a typically androgynous\nlove song, this time along the lines of\n\"tele p honor, why can'tI see you later?\"\nHow do you follow an energetic hit like\nLiving on the Ceiling? If you're Blancmange,\nyou re-record one of the weakest tracks on an\notherwise fine album, tar ting it up with a gospel-ish chorus and cloying string arrange-ment s, like so much rococo icing on a wedding\ncake. Consequently Waves (London) is a beached whale, bloated and smelling rotten.\nBack at sea, Pigbag urge us to Hit the O Deck\n(Y Records). Even the addition of a girl vocalist\ncan't pep up this decidedly flat cocktail of the\nusual rattling percussion and wailing horns.\nAnd on to albums. Who admits to\nremembering the Tourists? Famous for a reasonable cover of Dusty Springfield's/ Only\nWant To Be With You, their awful albums are\ncurrently celebrating two or three years in the\nbargain bins of Boots or Woolies record\ndepartments around the country. When they\nsplit up, the creative core of Annie Lennox and\nDave Stewart retired to the studio with\nKraftwerk, Ultravox and Eno & Cluster\nproducer Conny Plank, producing In The\nGarden LP and calling themselves Eurythmics.\nMusic for films: Ralph Dorper re-releases\nEraserhead (Operation Twilight) on a four-track 12\"\u2014a curious mix of noises, electronics\nand music hall. For fans of films only, the most\ndisturbing horror film of the last few years; a regular nightmare. Diva was a snappy voyage\naround Parisian twilight zones, a rich potpourri of opera, sex, razor-toting punks, and\nstyle in excess. The music was an added\nbonus; the soundtrack is on Palace.\nOn a different note, two events in town that\ncouldn't contrast more. On Sunday, Laurie\nAnderson plays an extra show at the\nDominion, Tottenham Court Road, so if\nyou've got the money and the stamina, her\neight hour show could be right up your\nstreet. And on Monday, the Southern Death\nCult play Heaven (Under the Arches, Villiers\nSt, near Charing Cross station), supported by\nBrilliant, a noisy dub-and-thunder outfit\nfronted by ex-killing Joker Youth. Heaven is\npossibly the best disco in town, exclusively gay\nfrom Wednesday to Saturday, but open to\nstraight audiences on Tuesday nights.\nAdmission is \u00a33, and for that you get three\nbars, videos, pool tables, and superb music,\nthe bastard offspring of Mighty Real and 7 Feel\nLove blasting out of the speakers whilst banks\nof lights spin and gyrate just above your heads\nlike something out of Close Encounters. The\nDJing is fluid, effortless mixing and stretching\nthe music, the accompanying laser displays\nstunning. Current floor fillers are In Deep's Last Night A DJ Saved My Life, Prince's1999, and Forest's reworking of the old Limmie &\nFamily Cooking hit Rock The Boat. All in all, a pretty fine way to spend a Tuesday evening;\nit's open from 10:00pm until 3:00am. Nigel Brand\nIREVIEWSI\nLoving Care\nCare by Roy Mitchell, directed by Antonia\nBird, Royal Court Theatre Upstairs,\nSloane Square.\nThis is the author's first full-length stage play\nand is concerned with parental responsibility,\nmarrying young and so on. The main\ncharacters Terry and Cheryl (Peter Hugo-Daly\nand Gwyneth Strong) met at school, married\nat seventeen and live in their native\nBirmingham. Terry works in a car factory and\nCheryl in a shoe shop. They have a council\nhouse, car, colour TV, three piece suite, a cat\nand...a problem that won't go away.\nThat is really all I want to say about the\ncontent of the play. However, the synopsis |\ndoes little to tempt you to venture down to the\nRoyal Court Theatre. In fact you probably\nthink as I did, that the play sounds as if it has\nall the characteristics of a trendy (but boring)\nTV play in which very little happens. In this\ncontinued on page 12\nMaking babies? Peter Hugo-Daly and Gwyneth Strong.\nWALKA80UTLOOKSEE I by Mobile Optics t \u00bbe. Those of you who read this column last week\nmay remember me describing a world with\nfuzzy edges. Since breaking my spectacles, I have tripped my way downstairs, most rudely\nignored the, to me invisible, smiles of friends\nand acquaintances and discovered that life\nbeyond the top of my desk is not designed for\nthe con ve ien ce of myopic citizens!\nHunting the Peppercorn\nBut I can see small things clearly, so went\nWalkabout in search of peppercorns!\nWaitrose, and like-minded supermarkets,\nattempt to fob off the shopper with small\npackages of ground pepper. These are sold at\nhigh prices: the pale grey substance they\ncontain produces a sensation of prickly dust\non the tongue which has little to do with the\nclean, spicy heat obtained by biting an intact\npeppercorn. I did not find peppercorns at\nWaitrose, so went hunting further afield. The\nbrief? To find black peppercorns at a reasonable price and in sufficient quantity, ie\nmore than 2oz, and not camouflaged in an\nelaborate glass bottle whose price suggests\nthat the cost of the packaging is at least equal\nto that of the contents. I eventually ran a supply to earth at 'Food for Thought', an\nattractive health food shop with one branch in\nthe Apple Market in Kingston, and another on\nNorth Street in Guildford. They sell black\npeppercorns in 250g packets (76p), which\nshould keep me going for a couple of years.\nOn the way home I meditated upon the\navailability, or rather non-availability of high\nquality interesting foodstuffs at afford ably interesting prices. Baked beans are a universal\nconstant and, piled on toast, with a sprinkling\nof salt and pepper, are equally delicious for\nbreakfast, lunch, tea or supper. But every now\nand then the Heinz variety palls\u2014what to do?\nBeans Means Heinz?\nIt's not necessary to trek off to Kingston to find\ndelicious alternatives to the humble hari cot bean. Branches of Holland Barrett have popped\nup like mushrooms, in Gloucester Road\n(on the same side as the tube station but\nnearer to Kensington Gardens), at the\nShepherd's Bush Centre, in Kensington\nChurch Street, Putney High Street, etc.\nThe shops' main aim appears to be\nspreading the word about herbal medicine and\nstone ground whole meal flour. But in-between\nthe boxes of Ginseng capsules and the bags of\nmillet flakes, neatly labelled cellophane\n(biodegradable) packets of brightly-coloured\nbeans, peas and lentils can be found. They're\nnot as quick as the tinned sort to prepare, but\ncan taste infinitely more exciting\u2014cover them\nin warm water (loz dried beans makes about\n2oz cooked) and leave to soak during lectures;\nsix or more hours later, bring them to the boil\nand bubble for ten minutes, then turn the heat\ndown and simmer till the beans are tender,\nwhich will take thirty minutes to one hour\ndepending on their size. The little brown lentils\nand green mung beans are quick; red kidney\nbeans and chickpeas take longer; split peas\ntake less than half an hour, but as their skins\nwere removed when they were split they don't keep their shape and cook to a 'mushy peas'\nconsistency.\nYou can also improve on the Heinz sauce:\nketchup for traditionalists; butter and then\nspiced with vinegar, mustard, soft brown\nsugar (just a little)\u2014Western style; smoky\nbacon, Worcestershire sauce and tomato\npuree\u2014Barbecued beans.\nThe most flavour some pulses are delicious\nserved simply. Chick peas (or 'garbanzos')\nlook like small golden hazelnuts and are used\nto make hummus throughout the Middle East.\nThey are also excellent on their own with a dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, a pinch each\nof salt and paprika and a generous sprinkling\nof freshly ground pepper ..didn'tI say\nsomething about pepper a few paragraphs\nago.''\nI February 18, 19831 I Page II\n\n"

    "content": "Song of Death\nThe Executioner's Song, Cert 15, directed\nby Lawrence Schiller, now playing at the\nWarner West End and Gate, Notting Hill.\nOnto rather heavier fare for the other film\nthis week. This film focusses on the notorious,\nbut short, career of Gary Gilmore.\nGilmore is at ra qi c, pathetic figure. In and\nout of prison since his juvenile delinquent days,\nhe has never been able to settle into society.\nReleased on parole once more, we see his brief\ndownward spiral. He is unable to hold down a job, he has a tempestuous but fraught\nrelationship with a young divorcee mother who\nis almost as mentally unstable as he is, but who\nhas managed to work within society, and\n(vent u a i ly he is on the slippery slope once\npga in of petty crime. He steals some guns to\ntry to get money. Being unable to sell them, he\ndecides to vent his rage at his impotence by\n1 tiling a garage attendant; it is a brutal, callous,\nsenseless murder. Next night he kills again,\nbut this time the game is up; his cousin decides\nshe must run him in before he kills again.\nMr Schiller must be admired for making afl m which does not seek to glorify or justify the\nman, a sin so often committed by film makers\nwhen they open this particular can of worms. I think you feel pity for the man, but then you\nlee l more pity for the corpses he leaves behind.\nThe camera refuses to dwell on the violence of\nthe shooting, not allowing the audience to\nrevel in the power of taking another man's life.\nGilmore appears barely sane; he talks mystic\nin umb o jumbo about 'karma', past lives, and\ndevil wor shop, but instead of an in-depth study\nof motivation and mentality, this film is much\nmore. It is a study of attitudes to homicide,\npersonal and judicial. It leaves a statement with\na lot of unanswered questions in your mind.\nJtah is a bad choice of state to go around\nMowing people away; contrary to the national\n:\naw which is anti-capital punishment, the state\nThe Dark Crystal, Cert PG, directed by\nJim Henson and Frank Oz, now playing at\nthe Plaza, Lower Regent Street.\nFrom the team that brought you the\nMuppets with the enormously successful TV\nseries and movie, $30m and five years in the\nmaking, The Dark Crystal has been a long\n\"^waited event among fantasy devotees. The\npre release publicity tried to point out that ET\nhad not stolen the show's thunder, despite the\nuse of similar animation technique, by pointing\nout the fact that this film has no human actors\nat all, and it was started long before ET was\neven thought of. There is a hint of remorse\nthat Lew Grade wanted Oz and Henson to get\non with the Muppet films and put this in cold\nstorage.\nSo can the team that produced the most\nunlikely,screen love affair in cinema history,\nbetween a frog and a prima donna pig, show\nSpielberg how it ought to be done? Will we see\nthat our infatuation with ET was merely the\ntwinges of first love, and in The Dark Crystal\nwe will find the true satisfaction of a mature\nrelationship?\nThe land of the The Dark Crystal is dark\nFt ux mum mm gma mmm mm \u2022 REVIEWS LH legislature has left that ultimate solution to\nprison overcrowding on its statute books.\nThere is no doubt, Gilmore was a danger to\nsociety; his murders were purposeless.\nNeither victim resisted or threatened Gilmore;\nhe was a psychopath in the grand tradition.\nBut just because a man deserves to die, can we\nkill' him in the name of protecting the rest of\nsociety?\nNormally this argument is not taken to the\nultimate conclusion. There are hundreds of\nmen in the States today awaiting the outcome\nof interminable appeals in solitary confinement\non 'death row'. But Gilmore Stopped his\nappeals. The sentence of his peers was death\nand he was prepared to accept it. He\nand barren after the world's three suns were in\nconjunction, and cracked the crystal, the\nbroken shard being lost. At that time two races\narose (look I know about genetics, you know\nabout genetics but...) the Skeksis and the\nMystics. The Skeksis got on with the messy\nbusiness of politics and tyranny while the\nMystics preserved knowledge, wisdom, beauty\nand singing out of tune. The mystics are\nguardians of the prophecy that one day the\ncrystal will be made whole when the shard (or\n'sherd' as Jim Henson would say) is reunited\nwith the crystal at the next conjunction. The\nprophecy states that it must be done at the\nnext conjunction or the rule of the Skeksis will\ndismissed his lawyer and hired one more\ncompliant to his wishes. In a life when he had\nbeen herded from one institution to another,\ntold what to do and where to do it, it is a decision he can make for himself, the ultimate\nexpression of the freedom of the individual.\nTommy Lee Jones plays Gimore brilliantly\nin one of the best performances I 've seen on\nthe screen for some time, in a scene during\nparole he walks along with a shuffling, skipping\nwalk. Later you see his feet manacled and\nyou realise that his odd gait is a result of years\nof conditioning. Everything about him, from his\nwounded mental outlook, his inadequacy with\nwomen to the way he eats is a product of the\ninstitution. It is an immensely strong and\nbrooding performance. Without doubt\nGilmore is a frightening, almost diabolic figure.\nThe film was originally made for television\nand shown over five episodes. This has two\nresults; despite editing it is still long, at 135\nminutes and the pace seems to undulate as we\nreach a dramatic climax at the end of each\nepisode. The film is unafraid to raise questions\nabout its own morality. Schiller is shown (as a somewhat leaner, younger man) hustling with\nGilmore's father over the film rights as his son\nsits on death row, and waiting, vulture like, as\nGilmour faces the firing squad. A powerful and\nthoughtful work which will leave a lot of\nquestions in your mind.\nI shall refrain from mentioning how much I'm looking forward to the Thursday film from Ents\nHistory of the World Part 1 as apparently\npraise goes to their heads. The last time I mentioned an Ents film a fortnight ago The Tin\nDrum, Ents responded by showing it in an\nunusual sequence. It was a shade disconcerting. We saw reel 3 which shows Ja>n Bronski getting blown away in the Polish Post\nOffice, and it is made clear that Mrs Mazerath\nhas suddenly died for no readily apparent\nreason, and then back to reel 2 and they ate\nback in the picture of health.\nendure for ever, and the task must be\nperformed by the diminutive Gelfling race\nTricky that, since, mindful of the prophecy art d with an obvious taste for power the Skeksis\nhave systematically slaughtered any Gelflings\nthey came across. However, the Mystics,\nobviously none too en amour ed with the\npresent government's record of unrestrained\ndeath and destruction, not to mention the\nunemployment figures, protect a Gelfling so\nthat the prophecy may be fulfilled.\nThe story, apparently, was invented by\nHenson's daughter, with, I would, surmise, a little help from JR R Tolkein.\ncontinued on page 10\n\n"

Surely\nyou realise you have a duty to\ncare for the present and future of\nmankind\u2014to make the world a better place to live in.\nThe dangers of porn and drink\nhave all too clearly been pointed\nout in previous issues of FELIX. But work, especially scientific,\ncan fall into this category if no\nother interests are involved. The\nmain reason you come to\nuniversity is to study your\ncourses, granted, but you also\nhave a unique opportunity to\nbroaden your minds in other\nareas.

Someone at the\nlast U GM said that it should not\nbe for the College to meddle\nwith politics\u2014the answer I have\ncome to expect to hear at this\nCollege. Unfortunately, the lives\nof people have all too often been\nput in jeopardy by the apathy\nof scientists to politics, and\npoliticians to science.

It is\nfar better that we convince the\nSouth African Government their\nsystem is wrong: that it is\nundemocratic and unrepresentative, and make the changes\nthrough legislation, rather than\nthrough violence. The only way\nthis can be achieved is by\nshowing we do not support them\nwhether that be financially or\nwhatever.\nSo far we have looked at the\nmatter from a self-interest point\nof view but what about other\npeople. Imagine you are a black\nin South Africa. You are required to have a pass which you\nmust carry around with you at\nall times; you may be expected to\nproduce it at any time whether\nyou are in the street or asleep at\nhome one night; you can be\nsearched for no reason; you do\nnot have the right to marry\nanyone you wish; if you wish to\nwork in a white town you must\nbe male and often be pre ap red to\nseparated from your family\nfor years, and then you must\nfind work within 72 hours; even\nif a white man is subordinate to\nyou in qualifications at work\nyou will earn between six to\ntwelve times less than him.\nWould you like to lead this sort\nof life under a racist regime?\nProtest\nFor once do something for\nsomeone else and join the\ndemonstration on March2 which will be attended by all the\nLondon colleges to protest\nagainst University of London's involvements with South Africa.\nThe demonstration will be\noutside IC from 10:00am till\n1:00pm.

    "content": "EDITORIAL\nExec Torture\nOne of the least savoury aspects\nof Rag Week is Exec Torture.\nFor those of you new to this\nquaint ritual, on the Tuesday of\nRag Week the Union Exec\n(technically Messrs Goulder,\nMcCallion, Grimshaw, Schmidt,\nWalls and Bishop, but others\ngenerally get co opted) gather in\nBeit Quad and passers-by are\ninvited to contribute to Rag\nfunds for the privilege of watching the Exec get covered in\n'the mix' which is a mixture\nwhose main constituents are\nfresh blood and contaminated\noffal.\nAs entertainment it rivals pig-sticking and bear-baiting, being\nlittle more than delight in\ndeliberate cruelty. As a means of\nra^!..g money it is ineffective:\nJohn McCallion, formerly Rag\nTreasurer, has said that the\nmoney raised barely covers the\ncost of the entrails. As a means\nof becoming infected it is second\nto none.\nThis last point is often\n(deliberately) ignored. It was not\nwidely reported, for instance,\nwhen last year's RCS President\nwas very ill as a direct result of\nExec Torture. I sent a reporter\nalong to chat with Dr McManus\nof Life Sciences, an authority on\nparas it ology, and some of the\ndiseases he described are, to put\nit mildly, unpleasant.\nFor starters there's tuberculosis and hepatitis, particularly if\nthe victim has any sort of cut,\nscratch or spot on their skin. The\ntapeworm Taenia sag g in at a is\noften found in cow offal, and\nwould have no hesitation in\nembedding itself into a human\nintestine. But the most spectacular by far is Echinococcus.\ngran u los us, found in sheep and\nhorse offal. The larva of this bug\nenters the human body via the\neyelid. It then travels round to\nthe back of the eye where it\nen cysts, forming a fluid filled\nbag which has the potential of\ngrowing as big as a football. This\ncyst contains thousands of other\nlarvae each capable of producing\nanother cyst. There is no chemical\ntherapy for this parasite-it can\nonly be removed by surgery.\nNormally there is no possibility of parasites, since offal (and,\nindeed, all meat) has to meet a strict standard before it is passed\nfor human consumption. But the\noffal used in Exec Torture is\navailable cheaply because it has\nnot passed the test.\nDoes the message need to be\nspelt out further? If this ritual of\nraising money by deliberately\nhumiliating members of the Exec\nthrough mob rule and mass\nhysteria is to continue (and\nknowing the mentality of most\nIC students, it will) at least\nl_lI III! \u201el~t~ f\" l~l~| i_i_0~i~ rrr rrr i\"i_I_I_ I_CI_,~ I~I\"\"I~I \u2022 j iiii restrict it to ingredients which\nwon't do any permanent damage.\nFELIX Staff\nThe position on the staff which\nis currently vacant is that of\nbook reviewer; I 've received all\nkinds of different books to\nreview, ranging from romantic\nnovels to thrillers to travel\nguides; anyone interested in\nreading any or all of these and\nwriting about them afterwards,\nplease see me in the FELIX Office. You get to keep the book\nafterwards!\nNext week is Rag Week with a thousand and one different\nevents in and around IC\u2014far\ntoo many for our regular photographers to cover. So if\nyou've ever had an inclination\ntowards photo-journalism, turn\nup at the FELIX Office at\n12:45pm today, or see me any\ntime.\nFinally, I have been feeling\nlately that FELIX is a bit thin on\nhumour; I don't want to decry\nthe regular humour features we\ndo publish, but if there are any\naspiring Alan Corens out there\nwho can write a regular satirical\ncolumn, I'd be only too happy to\nhear from you.\nElections\nHerewith the FELIX Editor's arbitrary and dictatorial rules\nfor printing of sabbatical election publicity.\nManifestos will appear in\nFELIX on Friday March 4.\nThey will be limited to three\nhundred words and may be\naccompanied by a black and\nwhite photograph or drawing.\nThey must be presented to me by\n1:00pm on Monday February\n28.\nAnyone wishing to prepare\nartwork may use FELIX facilities from Friday to Monday (of\nany week) but must get my\npermission first. Artwork ready\nfor printing by Tuesday morning\nwill be done by the following\nFriday.\nPublicity for other elections\ncan be printed in the FELIX Office (subject to the same\ndeadlines) but there is no room\nto allow preparation of artwork\nexcept dot-screening photo-graphs.\nBits and Pieces\nHay Fever sufferers can earn \u00a35\nfor half an hour's form filling in\nthe Health Centre: turn up there\nat 1:15pm on Tuesday.\nSketchley's, the cleaners, have\nasked me to tell you they are\ntesting a student discount scheme; present your Unioncard\nwhen making your order (not\nwhen collecting it) before the\nSales Assistant has rung the\norder into the till and you will be\nallowed a15% disc bunt. The\noffer is open until March 31 at\ntheir branches at 28/30 Gloucester Road and at 99 Gloucester\nRoad.\nMartin S Taylor\nTO THE CASUAL OBSERVER\nthe political wrangling s within\nSTOIC may seem intense but\naccording to next year's secretary Dunal Quigley all the\ncommittee pos to'. vcr e settled ac:\nlong ago as last Christmas some\ntwo months before papers even\nwent-up.\nIf true, these allegations may\nexplain certain discrepancies in\nthe electoral procedure as\ninterpreted by returning officer\nLawrence Windley. The constitution clearly states that only\ntwo second ers are needed for\neach candidate whereas Mr Windley has stipulated three, in\nan effort, it is said, to discourage\nopposition to his chosen can di dates.\nOne of the most interesting\nthings is that the constitution\nwas written in March 1982 under\nthe chairmanship of Mr Windley\nhimself. What is his mod ve for\nignoring his own rules?\nWhile on the subject of STOIC, I can reveal the sign if i BELOW\ncan ces of vai io us references in\nthe Small Ads and elsewhere to\nthe STOIC toad.\nBack in the dark days of 1970\nSi wI C was formed by Sinclair\nGoodlad who has since fallen\nout of favour. However moves\nhave been made recently to ask\nDr Good lad to be STOIC President.\nNow STOIC have just had a drastic reduction in studio time\nmaking it difficult to complete\ntheir usual programmes. Do STOIC want to get their hands\non Dr Good lad's Elec Eng Studio? Or is it a plot in collusion with the Studio Manager Colin Grimshaw to incorporate the Elec Eng Studio into\nthe IC TV Studio empire?\nCollege has recently refused to\ngive the Elec Eng Studio to Mr Grimshaw as they say he doesn't need it.\nIt makes Dallas look realistic.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 iii iii iiii iii iii iii\"''''^'' OIC CC'I' C C1\n\" \" 1 -' -' -' \" 1\nr rI,C COI CCC CO I'J~|~I~ I~I~,~,\"I~I~ \u2022 i it \u2022 iii iii iii iii iii iiO ICC COI|~,~,~|~| \u2022 * \u00bb \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00bb~R\" \u00bb_*~lt*~l III \u2022 \u2022 III \u2022 II \u2022 \u2022flI Il\" IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE it\nwas re-formed by a former\nFELIX Editor, but the HG Wells Society has always attracted more than its share of\nUnion hacks. Witness last\nWednesday's formal dinner\nattended by Messrs Goulder,\nMcCallion, Grimwash, Schmidt,\nRodan...Not content with overwhelming the occasion by sheer\nforce of numbers, they insisted\non mono poli sing the conversation topics all evening, which\nresulted in dreadful tedium to\nthose uninterested in who will\nstand for which election next\nweek.\nEventually it became too much for the Chairman Mike\nMacClancy, who had he come increasingly irritated by Stephen\nGoulder (who was only one of\nthe guests) trying to organise the\nfunction, and by assorted\npoliticos each trying to out guess the others' prediction for next\nyear's sabbaticals. So during his\nspeech, Mike mentioned that he\nwas going to stand for as abba tica l post. Apparently the\nresulting confusion at the bar\nafterwards was most gratifying.\nA NUMBER OF YOU felt (see\nLetters, page 4) that we had not\ndone ET justice in printing a picture of such a youthful Henry\nSawistowski.

The night before this meal is to take\nplace, make chip salad as follows. Fry enough\nchips sor two. Drain and divide between two\nplates. Pour a generous helping of mint sauce\nover each helping. Cover thickly with grated\ncheese and grill until it melts down between\n3\nDINOS\n1 Pelham Street, SW7\n589 3511\nOpen 9am every day. Last orders 11:45pm( Mon to Sat) and 11:30pm( Sun).\nApart from its proximity to College (just round\nthe corner from the entrance to South\nKensington tube), this place does not have\nmuch to recommend it.\nThe decor is as tasteless as the food and\nthe chips. Scatter a few caraway seeds on top\nof the cheese. Chill in fridge overnight.\nThe next morning, make sausage e clair s. You will need long frankfurt her rolls, a gill of\nsour cream, a tin of anchovies and the\nsausages of your choice. While the sausages\nare frying, mash the anchovies thoroughly and\nstir into the sour cream. Slit open the rolls,\ndrop a sausage into each and then pipe the\ncream over the sausages in a zigzag.\nServe these two delicacies with Buck's Fizz\nEgg-nog. Put four raw eggs, measure of\nbrandy, half a pint of fresh orange juice and a half a pint of champagne (or equivalent) into\na blender and blend thoroughly. Serve in long\nglasses, garnished with black olives.\nTo finish off, serve black coffee with slices of\ntoast and marmalade fried in batter.\nalthough it is clean and the service is\nreasonable the atmosphere is purely\nfunctional.\nMost of the menu is not expensive but then\nneither is it good value for money. For\nexample, the starters vary from 30p to \u00a31.35\nbut although Prawn Cocktail at \u00a31.10 was\nadjudged good with lots of prawns, the\nAvocado with Prawns was remarkably free of\nflavour.\nOf the pastas, Spaghetti alia Carbonara\n(\u00a31.70) which purported to be spaghetti with a sauce of bacon, cream and eggs, looked the\nmost app et ising. It turned out to be greasy\nspaghetti with bacon scraps. Now it may well\nbe that Spaghetti alia Carbonara is meant to\nturn out as greasy spaghetti with bacon scraps\nbut this observation is no consolation\nwhatsoever to the hapless diner who may feel\nthat grease and bacon scraps is a far cry from\na sauce of bacon, cream and eggs.\nCordon Bleugh must have had a hand in this\nmenu. Curried scampi with rice (\u00a33.95) for\nexample seems to cry out for a large dollop ot\nraspberry and guava marmalade.\nMain courses range from \u00a31.70 to \u00a34.70.\nMaybe the more expensive dishes represent\nthe epitome of culinary excellence, but I doubt\nit and who wants to spend \u00a34 70 in a dump like\nthis anyway.\nThe Fegato alia Veneziana (\u00a32.40) was\ndescribed as lambs liver fried in butter with\nonions and parsley, which may well have been\nwhat it was\u2014I was far too overwhelmed by the\nawfulness of the accompanying anaemic peas\nto notice.\nThe puddings were better. A good sized bit\nof gate au for 75p was best buy.\nThe bill for two with half a litre of wine came\nto \u00a310.25 plus tip, but it was hardly money well\nspent.\nPORT\nOn Monday February 7, IC beat\nLondon Hospital 4-1. The score\nshould have been about 10-0,\nbut Python, Richard and Jim\nwere'still recovering from ULU's polo tour to Paris that weekend,\nand from the traumas of spending the nights in various combinations with Mary and Fran\n(tic Lay).\nTuesday night saw us getting\nthings together a bit better when\nwe beat St Thomas' Hospital 6-2\nalthough John didn't help much\nby trying to bounce the ball off\nthe ceiling on his first shot. Paul\ngot two brilliant goals.\nOn Thursday morning, Martin\nremembered that his passes at \\\nULU's bisexual ling ra tory had\ncome to no avail (Fran didn't like snakes) on Saturday night,\nand promptly got a severe dose\nof th fe shits which meant that we\nwere without our reptilian goalkeeper for Friday's friendly\nj against Woodside. Consequently\nwe thrashed them by an un-remember able amount, with\neveryone getting lots of goals\nexcept Paul and Martin who\nweren't there.\nWe've got another dozen or so\nmatches between now and the\nend of term, so if Richard\n(Rogers) and Stuart's girlfriends\ncan do without them for an hour\nor two, it would be nice to see\nthem at training again sometime.\noc key Thirds\nIC vs BA\nIC Thirds took off in great style\nwith four quick goals in the first\nhalf. Three of them came from\nCharles Eldridge who spent\nmost of the match trying to\nrearrange the features on the\nopposition's faces. After several\nnear misses Paul Dube m ski scored (a goal). We were brought\ndown to earth again in the\nsecond half as the ref reckoned\nthe ball went past Tim Stocking\n(goalie) twice...the audacity of\nthe blok e.

He, and others, may or\nmay not be aware that both the\nfaulty films he mentions (Psycho\nand The Tin Drum) are distributed by the same company:\nR* nk Audio Visual Ltd. Needless to say, both faults were\npresent 'at source'. The first was\ndue to incorrect splicing leading\nto the film being out of sync with\nthe shutter, and the second\nhaving incorrect labelling on the\nleader tapes.\nAny other mistakes in the\nshowing of films will be due to\nthe projectors, which are the\nconcern of Film Soc. Therefore\nby simple argument if anything\ngoes wrong, it is not my fault, I only book the films and collect\nthe money.\nWhy not come to an Ents film\n(ME220, 6:30pm, Thursdays)\nand see how it should be done.\nYours sincerely\nGerard Livett\nIC Ents\nProletarian\nPresident\nDear Martin\nStephen Goulder has told\nFELIX that he would be in\nfavour of a system of student\nloans en lieu of grants 'if one\ncould be devised that would\nincrease the number of working\nclass students at university'. Was\nth fs just an attempt to be non-corn mit al, or does our Proletarian President really believe\nthat an education mortgage of\nthree thousand pounds will\nencourage low-income families\nto send their offspring to\nUniversity?\nYours\nAdrian James\nPage4 \u2022 H MBH H HM Insulting\nCorrespondence\nDear Sir\nIn your last week's editorial\nyou accused me of sending you a 'rather insulting letter'. Having\nsince consulted various members\nof your staff, the general\nconsensus seems to be that you\nwere talking through your backside.\nYours in anger\nNick Pyne\nHealth Insurance\nDear Martin\nIn response to the Forward\nwhich IC Liberals distributed\naround College last week, we\nhave received a number of\nqueries about the \u00a312 levy which\nthe College is imposing on\nresidents of College administered property; nominally a payment for the services of the\nHealth Centre. We have investigated the ramifications/\nlegality of this scheme and have\ndiscovered that those in head\ntenancies had no mention of the\npayment in their agreements\nand, it appears, are entitled to a refund. The scheme is supposed\nto be compulsory for all those\nstudents in halls of residence but\neven this is doubtful in law. How\ncan students be forced to make a compulsory payment for a private health scheme?\nThis new payment of \u00a312 has\nbeen introduced because College\nhas withdrawn its financial\nbacking. We believe that regardless of any other argument it\nshould be (a) the choice of the\nindividual student whether s/ he\nopts into what amounts to a private health scheme, and (b) the responsibility of all students,\nand certainly not the sole\nresponsibility of those occupying\nthe few halls of residence rooms\navailable, to finance a common\nservice. These however are\nminor points compared with the\nprinciple that College seems to\nhave adopted; that health\nprovision should be paid for by\nthe student body, especially in a city in which NHS facilities are\nso inadequate.\nYet again it seems that our\nUnion has let students down; it\nhas failed to explain what is\ngoing on; it has allowed College\nto save money at our expense\nand colluded in a scheme which\ncould be illegal. We feel that all\nthose students who have been\nobliged to pay the levy, especially those in hall who at\npresent have no option but to\npay, should get an immediate\nrefund: this compulsory scheme\nshould be withdrawn right away\n\u2022 Hr M MNM BMI February\nand the College should fulfil its\nresponsibility to the whole\nstudent body by financing an\nessential service.\nPhilip Nathan\nClub Coordinator IC Libs\nDave Trevor-Jones\nTreasurer IC Libs\nPublicity\nDear Martin\nI find in your letters column\nyet another letter concerning the\nIslamic Society poster crisis.\nThis crisis is so major that I suspect that few of your readers\nhave ever heard of it.\nI have yet to see any reason in\nthe constitution why the Executive action relating to the\nHuman Rights Fair display was\nwrong. In this case, and in the\ncase of Mines Review, a petition\nof twenty signatures was received\nby the Union. Both cases were\ninvestigated and the appropriate\naction taken.\nMindless fanaticism will not\nprevail at Imperial College.\nYours sincerely\nStephen Goulder\nAnti-Gravity\nDear Sir\nWe. the residents of 37\nHamlet Gardens, feel we can no\nlonger remain silent concerning\nthe abnormal terrestrial conditions in. and around, our flat.\nWe refer specifically to the\nludicrous gravitational fluctuations that occur here. The most\ndisturbing aspect of this phenomenon is the ridiculously high\nforce of gravity that exists in the\nante-meridian period. It is our\npersonal experience that on\nsome occasions the gravitational\nforces have been so intense that\nthe victim had been rendered\nhelpless, pinned to his bed and\nunable to rise. Only yesterday,\nhaving crawled from his own\nresting place, Mr P Donnelly\nfound another resident, MrC Boyd, flattened against his\nmattress, his face contorted in\nhis struggle to overcome the\nearths attraction.\nAs conscientious students who\nstrive to make the most of our\nuniversity years, we find it\nparticularly distressing that this\nproblem is beginning to have an\nadverse effect on our attendance\nrecords. We acknowledge that\nMichael Arthur and his student\nservices are powerless in combatting this quirk of nature.\nHowever, we feel that the lack\nof research into this subject is\npuzzling, especially since IC\nhas amongst its ranks a leading\nworld authority on localised\nheavy gravity anomalies, Dr I Grist. Dr Grist informs us 'these\n18, 1983\nphenomena are common, but\nhave in the past been wrongly\nexplained away as due to\nalcoholic overindulgence'.\nTo sum up our concern is\nheightened by today's prolonged\n'gravity surge' which has extended well into the post-meri dean period. If this state of\naffairs remains unchanged we\nwill be forced to complete our\nuniversity courses from our\nbeds.\nYours prostrate lyC Boyd\nA Hurford\nP Donnelly\nG Elliott\nS Pilgrim\nS Davis\nCopies sent to: Minister of the\nEnvironment; Ecology Party;\nGravitational Weekly; Dr I Grist, Robert Kelsey; Mary Whitehouse.\nPornography\nor Art?\nSir\nLife is curious\u2014isn't it? For\ninstance last weekend I was\ndiscussing with another student\na play written by a lesbian\nacademic with a cast composed\nentirely of women. Mention was\nmade of a love scene in which\nthe heroine is seduced by a man\nand the opinion was passed that\ninstead of merely hugging one\nanother the women involved\nshould have given a rather more\nconvincing performance\u2014even\nto the point of nudity and\nbeyond.\nStrong stuff, eh? And yet the\nperson with whom I was having\nthe conversation was none other\nthan a member of the faculty of\npolitics at Sussex University\u2014\nand yes she was true to form, ie\nshe made WIST and the late-I CW A look mild.\nStrong, eh? When the Royal\nSchool of Mines watches women\ncavorting naked on stage, it's pornography, and yet when the\ntrendy intellectuals of Sussex\nwatch it then it's art\nYours sincerely\nSimon Curling\nPhone Home\nSir\nI must protest in the strongest\npossible manner at your ridiculous ET lookalike competition\nin last week's FELIX, in which I feel that I have been particularly\nshabbily insulted. You have,\nwhile thoughtlessly looking for a little harmless fun, caused\nirreparable damage to one\nwhose reputation stretches far\nbeyond the boundaries of IC.\nI demand an apology.\nYours\nET\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nCCUsN\nETC ASH After Gross Tactics By Council Members\nA new lion on Queen's Lawn heralds the year of the pig. Details inside.\nIC STUDENTS ON FIREARMS CHARGE\nThe Union Finance Committee's decision to cut Constituent College Union grants next year was\nreversed at Monday's Council\nmeeting after several Union\nofficials attempted to block the\nreversal by making the meeting\nin quo rate. The original motion, presented to UFC last Friday, was\nproposed by the Recreational\nClubs Committee and seconded\nby Atheletics Clubs, Social\nClubs, Publications Board and\nSCAB. It suggested that C CU estimates for 1983/4 were\nexaggerated and represented an\nunrealistic position and thus\ncould justifiably be cut. Items to\nundergo cuts included entertainments and exec honoraria. According to the motion, the\nICU President was to ensure that\nMajor Sub-committee's demands are met more readily thus\nchannelling money into IC\nUnion clubs rather than C CU clubs.\nThis motion was passed by\nUFC, where Major Subcommittee representatives outnumber C CU representatives.\nBut at the Union Council meeting on Monday night,\nPresident Stephen Gould er included an item on C CU expenditure in his report, which\nconcluded that the CCUs' cash\nlimits would have to depend on a priority determined by UFC. At this point the meeting,\nchaired by John Passmore,\nbecame heated as the C CU presidents presented an emergency motion which would\nreverse the UFC decision which\nthey described as \"unrepresentative and undemocratic\". Due\nto the strong presence of DepartNo. 6 3 7 HH HH H mental Representatives and\ndelegates, the Major Subcommittee officers estimated\nthat they would be defeated and\ntherefore attempted to close the\nmeeting before the vote. In order\nto do so, Jonathan Miller, Ian\nBull, Mike Prosser and Matthew\nTonks, the SCC, ACC, Publications Board and SCAB Chairmen respectively, walked out of\nthe meeting leaving John McCallion, ICU DP, to call quo-rum. However, the challenge\nwas unsuccessful and an attempt\nby a non-voting person to call\nquorum after John McCallion\nand Hugh Southey had left was\ndefeated by Jon Barnett's oratory ability. The motion was\nthen passed by an overwhelming\nmajority in the absence of the\nopposing officials.\nFour students were arrested for\npossession of a toy pistol in\nCumbria last Saturday. Carl\nFairhurst, Tony Collier and Julian\nBarber, all undergraduates at\nImperial, and Martin White from\nCambridge have been released on\nbail.\nThe four were on their way to\nthe Lake District for a weekend\nof climbing. They had with them\na cap-pistol which one of the\nfour had been given for Christmas, and when a lorry pulled out\nin front of them on the M6, Mr Collier wound down the car\nwindow and 'shot' the driver\non the way past. Some time\nafterwards, they noticed a Police\nRange Rover behind them, and\n'shot' it through the back\nwindow. The police car followed\nthem for some twenty miles, and\nwhen they turned off the motorway they were intercepted by\nmore cars. In all, ten policemen\n\u2014two of them armed\u2014and five\npolice cars were used.\nThe four students were\nsearched, the gun was confiscated and they were driven,\nhandcuffed, to Kendal Police\nStation, about five miles distant.\nThere they had their shoes and\nbelts removed and were kept for\none and a half hours in a cell\nwhile individual statements\nwere taken from all four. Their\nfingerprints and photographs\nwere taken before they were\nreleased on bail, although they\nclaim that they were never\nformally charged\u2014in fact, this\nwas the first indication that they\nhad been arrested. They were\ntold that the lorry driver had\nreported a shooting incident,\nand that because the students\nhad been stopped by Lancashire\nPolice they could not be charged\nat Kendal, which is in Cumbria.\nThey are expected to attend\nLancaster Police Station on\nMarch 12, where formal charges\nmay be made\u2014probably for\nBreach of the Peace, according\nto a police spokesman. He said\nthat th\" charges would not be\nse riou \u201e, out that it was 'a stupid\nthing to do in this day and age'.\n\u2022 \u2022 HH HN MM HM HI Free\nFriday, February 18, 1983\n\n"

This implies that \"the last statement was\ntrue\" is false, which is a contradiction.\nSuppose, then, that it is false. This implies that\nit is true, from the next statement, again a contradiction.

However, in\n\"What Is The Name Of This Book\" by\nRaymond Smullyan, which I hope to review in\nthe next couple of weeks, he points out that a better reason for disallowing statements is this:\n\"Our guiding principle is that to understand\nwhat it means for a sentence to be true, we\nmust first understand the meaning of the\nsentence itself.\" Thus, 'two plus two equals\nfour' is not allowed because we must know\nwhether it is true before we can ascertain its\nveracity.\nRadio 4\npresents\nA CUE Willy Rush ton Graeme Garden Barry Cryer Tim Brooke Taylor A double recording of this show wil\ntake place in\nThe Concert Hall\nUnion Building\non\nMonday February 28\nDoors open 6:15pm recording starts 6:30pm available from Union Office.\nFree tickets a i SIT\nONIT\nYou don't need us to\n[tell you how much\na cycle makes.\nBut you do need\nus to help\nchoose your\nnext bike\nWe'll service\nit, guarantee\nand\nshould\nanything go wrong, repair it\nbeautifully.

    "content": "No Report\nfor Weeks\nThe College's long awaited\nresidence report will come too\nlate to have any influence on this\nyear's accommodation policy,\naccording to Union President\nStephen Goulder. It cannot, he\nsaid, be seen by both Residence\nand House Committees in time\nfor its recommendations to be\ncarefully considered.\nThe seventy-five page report\nwas commissioned by College\nSecretary John Smith last year,\nand was to have been ready for\nthe beginning of this term. But\nJohn Lauwerys was unable to\nproduce the report in time, and\nalthough the first draft has been\nseen it is not yet ready for\nprinting. This means that\nimportant decisions based on the\nreport's recommendations may\nnot be made until the summer\nvacation, and so if, as expected\nWeeks Hall is to become purely\nfor the use of postgraduates, it\nmay have to wait until next year.\nMr Smith explained to FELIX that he had commissioned the\nreport because decisions over the\npast year have been made with\nno firm policy in mind, leading\nto anomalies in the system. But\nhe did not feel that the timing of\nthe report was critical, as in his\nopinion House Committee would not be considering it\u2014it\nwas just the concern of Residence Committee.\nThe report is expected to\nsuggest changes in the head\ntenancy system\u2014when property\nprices rise, landlords may sell\ntheir properties. As the College\nis committing itself to housing\nall first year students, a more\npermanent agreement with the\nowners of the Fiemantle and\nSovereign Hotels may be necessary. The traditional British Lion looks on with interest as IC Chinese Society perform a lion dance on the\nQueens Lawn. Last Friday was the eve of the year of the pig, and despite the inclement weather and a late start, the dancers were well pleased with the result.\nDancing\nSuccess\nTwo teams from Imperial College Ballroom Dancing Club\ncame third after University\nCollege London and Oxford\nUniversity in the St Ives competition last Saturday. This should\nstand them in good stead for the\nnational inter-varsity competition on March 4.\nThe entire first team, well\nsupported by a good turnout of\nspectators, reached the finals,\nwith the quickstep and chach a couples coming second, the\nwaltz third and jive fifth. On\ntheir way the team defeated\nteams from Cambridge, Bristol,\nBirmingham and Southampton.\nAlte\nMailing\nThe cost of mailing copies of the\nImperial College Union Alternative Prospectus will not be met\nby College this year. Instead, the\nUnion will have to find about\n\u00a31,500 to send copies to 9,000\nschools in Britain and abroad.\nLast year, the AP was sent out\nwith the College's Official\nProspectus at the College's expense, but this year the official\npublication will be printed in a less extravagant form in Bristol,\nand from there it will be sent\ndirect to the schools on the\nFELIX mmm mmm mmm UCC A list. As arrangements\nhave already made to have\nthe AP printed in London, it\nseems that the Union will have\nto pay this year's postage from\nits own pocket, as well as\nemploying colla tors to put the\nbooks in envelopes and address\nthem. Hugh Southey, this year's Alternative Prospectus Editor, is\nlooking into several schemes to\nsave money by sending the APs\nout w pub lk t ions from other\ncolleges. He stressed the importance of the AP in presenting a critical students' eye view of\nImperial and pointing out faults\nwhich official prospectuses tend\nto gloss over.\nMascots: 'Mines is Ours'\nThe Royal College of Science Union has re-captured Davey, the\nRSMU's violate mascot. On Tuesday several members of the RCSU\nfound Davey in a pink bin liner behind the Messenger's desk in the\nRoyal School of Mines. It is two years since the RCSU last captured\nDavey, and RCSU officials have refused to name their members\ninvolved in the abduction for fear of reprisals from the Miners.\nFebruary 18, 1983 BPage3\n\n"

We all know (don't we)\nthat God created the Universe in all its glory.\nBut the Universe is infinitely complex and its\ncourse governed by chance. Thus God decides\nour fate with dice. As the whole of creation\ncontains so many random variables the dice\nwould have to be of an infinite number of sides\n\u2014 but with an infinite number of sides all of\nfinite area the dice must be of infinite volume.\nSo large that it could contain the Universe,\nperhaps.
