    "content": "_ 2 FELIX\nEditorial comment\nA few days ago, T received a letter from\nthe President of the Architectural Association (who is an old student of T.C. asking if\nwe have considered the far reaching affects\nof the proposal that the A. A. School should\nbecome n four l fi College of T.C. The enclosed\ndocument says that informal discussions with\nthe Rector took place last summer, and a few months later the Governing Body of ths\nImperial College passed a resolution author-sing the Rector to conduct negotiations with\nthe A. A. The cond it io uns fundamental to the\nnegotiations were that no additional financial burden shall fall on the College, the expansion programme of the College shall not\nbe impeded, and that the A. A. School should\nbe prepared to move into close proximity\nwith the College,\nThe negotiations, which are \"not uncomplicated\", are now going on.\nThe merger seems highly probable. What\nwould be the effects? The first thing which\nstrikes me is that efforts will be made to have\nmuch closer links with the Royal College of\nArt. Perhaps another merger, eventually.\nThen why not a University of South Kensington? Up crops the old question, old as\nN.U.S. and Mooney's food. This is just my\nguess. What do you think?\nTalking of Mooney's food, there is an article this week on our refectories by Dave\nWilbraham. I agree with his views. Actualh\nI'd like to see an investigation carried jut\nby a batch of experts on the nutritive value\nof the meals served in the Union refectories.\nMany complaints l have been made about the\ntaste of the food (all justified) about the state\nof the food (also justified), and they seem\nto have had lit le effect. A charge of mal nutritive diet would be difficult to ignore (and\nagain it is a justifiable personal guess that\nthe experts would find the meals pathetically\nItWui\nt btk UitbL\nnear Sir,\nWith respect to the R.C.S.

Words of this nature were cut by the pro\nduce r beforehand, only to be re-inserted by\nIhe cast during the performance.\nThe main reason for the low standard cf\nSeveral of the acts is that, had they been\nomitted, the Concert would not have lasted\nan hour. Scripts of high quality were, in fact\nsubmitted, but later the departments concerned lost interest, or decided \"that it isn't dirty enough for a Smoking Concert.\"\nA recommendation will be put to next\nyear's committee to cut all four letter words,\nreferences to sex, and not to supply free beer,\nas this is the main cause of the rowdy at-mo sphere. Yours sincerely,\nDICK FOSTER\n(Chairman, R.C.S. Ent. Com.}\nlacking m the essential daily requirements\nof vitamins, proteins, and minerals.).\nA series of articles has been initiated to\ninform the Union about the problems of\nrunning the Union. This week we have two\nexperienced Union members, who have held\nor are holding important Union positions\n(ha, ha). Next week it is hoped to have the\nSecretary of the Union, and the Presidents\nof the Constituent Colleges, writing articles,\nand the issue after that will carry articles\nby the Chairmen of the S.C. C.,R.C. C.,A.C. C. and the Entertainments Committee.\nThe President will round of the series, and it\nis hoped that you will write to us blasting off\nat anything in the Union. These series\nwill also give an idea of what is involved in holding the Union positions,\nwhich will be contested next month.\nIn the next issue of Felix, I hope to hold\na Forum of discussion on the problems of\nforeign students.\nThey encounter a number of difficulties in\nfinding accommodation (and believe me this\ncan reduce you to tears sometimes), and getting used to the food and social customs\nand the aching loneliness of being in an impersonal metropolis thousands of miles from\nhome. I would appreciate it very much if\nyou write to Felix about any experience or\nadvice which could help solve this important problem. Some very good work has been\ndone by Dan Elwyn Jones and Fr. Ivor Smith\nCameron in connection with this problem,\nand it is hoped that they will start off the\ndiscussion.\nUltimately, without your active part ici p ation, whether it be a Carnival or a Debate,\nnothing can be done.

Smoking Concert I would not place the\nblame entirely with those responsible for its\n.production.\n1 was concerned with the previous three\nt Concerts, and not withstanding Mr. Guy's reference to \"an all time low two years\nago\", we did strive to infect into the programme sketches of a subtle, musical, or topical nature. In most cases these were either\nbrutally cat-called or misunderstood by the\nappreciative part of the audience because of\nthe verbal diarrhoea of i( he drunken remain-der.\nThe trend 'is towards audience domination\ny it can no longer be called participation).\nI have been amazed at the implications an\naudience has drawn from perfectly innocent\nlines. Secondly, the attitude of pe pole preparing the material towards the prospective\naudience degenerates from a desire to entertain to contempt. The consequences are re-gret table. The audience at the Concert expects bawdiness and the cast provides it at present.\nAny improvement in the standard of entertainment must come from both sides of the\nfootlights.\nYours sincerely,\nSTAN SALMON I \u2014CURRENT EVENTS \u2014 i MCPHERSON GATE CRASHES13,000,000 HOME SI.C.

For surely this\ncounts as an IC Union Meeting, and if the\nGuildsmen present had passed a motion that\nRCS should be ejected from the IC Union\nor something similar could RCS have done\nanything about it? No doubt our procedure\nexperts can sort that one out. The constituent colleges have certainly shown the IC Union the way in getting people to attend\ntheir meeting; all you need is a dispensable\nroom (size is not really important) and some\nfairly bawdy entertainment laid on. Dead\neasy. No doubt the technique will have to\nbe refined and given a transatlantic flavour\nbefore its adopted for the IC Union AGM but its always a possibility. Of course the\nreally effective way of avoiding in quo rate meetings is to lay on free beer: this presumes that at least 12% of the Union likes\nbeer enough to come along for it but we\nthink this can be taken as read. The beer\nwould be paid for out of increased Union\nfees. Two practical solutions to a real problem and no doubt they will both be dismissed in favour of yet more nebulous talk\nabout the sins of apathy.\nAn ex-editor of this paper who was taken\nto task for his unfair treatment of the C ND affair (if anybody remembers it now) has let\nSo the Editor has started a new series on\nthe Union.

Concert Hall. It was\nbelieved to be the first amateur performance of the latter. Though the professional\nsoloists did not reveal the ability expected\nof them, the Choir sang magnificently and\nmany of the audience found it difficult to\nunderstand why Dr. Brown did not bring\nthem to their feet to receive their own deserved part of the appreciation. Should more\nambitious concerts be planned in the future,\nperhaps financial help will be forthcoming\nso that lower prices will attract many more\nto hear them sing.\nYOUR GUESS\nIf one happened to enter the Union Office\nat the beginning of term, the letter racks\ncould be seen to bear unusual identification s being respectively, 'In' Out' 'Left' 'Right'\n'Up' 'Down'l To the un inquisitive this presents no prop lem. However, for ot i her s, 'In'\nand 'Out' are self explanatory, and 'Left' and\n'Right' could be special divisions for the active political groups of the College. But 'Up'\nand 'Down' present no easy solution. Can it\nbe that they were required to deal with a mass of correspondence concerning the YoYo habits of the new sports centre ceiling?\nEXTENSIONS? For the less well informed, there appears to\nbe a controversy over the Union Bar ex-tensions. The new licencing laws make it necessary to apply for a new form of licence,\nthe College no longer being considered a 'Club' in the eyes of the law, and this is considered to affect applications for extensions.\nSides appear to be taken by those who want\napplications to be unlimited, those who want\nthem limited to twelve, and about two thousand eight hundred who couldn't care less.\nFor those interested, a round the clock\nservice is feasible by having the bar installed\nin a converted railway coach which could\nmove across the quad at a specified speed\nand thus provide us with a moving bar.\nThere are rumours that the laws may be\nmanipulated to accomodate recognised sports\ncentres and clubs!\nViewpoints \"It's. amazing how Hilary and I think of\nthe same thing at the same time \u2014 and it's not always sex.\"\nLawrie Austin, President of Guilds.\n\"I'm dressed, thank you.\"\nCarolvn Russel to I.C. student at Shepherd's Bush.\n\"I did it.\"\nFinlay Macpherson, the first thing in the\nmorning after the Guild's Carnival.\n\"London Transport is quite good.\"\nPresident of I.

He\nspoke at length on the work of Civil Engineers in shafting through the Alps and on the\nsize of their erection, and Elec.

When something short of total\nchaos was restored, Asit Chandmal told a few old jokes on behalf of Mech.

He began in good debating style by defining the terms of the mot-ion, concentrating on the word \"woman\".\nHe said no clear definition was possible,\nsince women so often look like men, bu\u00bb\nlisted 6 properties;\n1.

    "content": "FELIX 3 -President's Introductory\nNote\nMr. Chandmal. the newly appointed Editor\nof Felix, has arranged to run a series of articles written by members of the Union who\nhave taken .or are st if ll taking, an active\npart in its administration. I hope that this\nseries will be of interest to the readers of\nFelix, and at the same time inform them of\nwhat is involved in running the Union.\nIt is fairly apparent that at the present time\nthere is a limited contact between the elected\nrepresentatives and the majority of the stud-ents. This series of articles should help to\nbridge this gap. and at the same time encourage more students to take an active part in\nthe Union.\nIt would be very fitting if you as a member of the Union wrote an article for this\nseries stating what the Union does or does\nnot do for you. T think Mr. Chandmal would\nundoubtedly find that these articles would\nbe an excellent way to terminate this series.\nNo Ape-ing of Oxbridge Nobody sane comes here without the in*\ntent ion of getting a degree and it is prima ri/ y for their technical qualifications that employers seek graduates from this College.\nAnything students get up in their spare time\nis really incidental. To hear some people talk\none would think the Union is the be-all and\nend-all; but it isn't: it is, let's face it, another\nincidental. I am not saying that incidentals\nare unimportant, for if one is to spend several years of one's life at the job of getting\nqualifications then how and where one lives,\neats, and relaxes, are very pertinent consid ei at ions in the efficiency with which one does\nthe job apart from anything else. But one\nshould keep a sense of proportion and remember that the Union only exists to look\nafter these matters to some extent Sensible\nUnion policies should therefore be firm lv based on the wishes and needs of the majority of Union members.\nEvery year the Union Council is responsible for dispensing thousands of pounds of\nmembers' money in fu the ring these interests.\nBy and large I think Council makes the\nright decisions as to what to do with the\nmoney most of it going into well tried chan-nel s. Any individual council only makes relatively small adjustments to the traditional\nsystem, which is I think quite right and pro-per. Some people talk of revolutionary\nchanges and they are wasting their breath as\nthe vast majority of members are quite satis\"\nfled with the basic mode of operation. The\naverage Union member is only too glad to\nhave a change from the lecture theatre and\nlaboratory and so I think it is absolutely right\nthat the bulk of the Union Budget should go\ninto the Athletic and Recreation Clubs Committees and into the Entertainments Committee (who run the hops and balls).\nThere is, however, one side of Union activities that is not as strong as those aspects\nI have already mentioned. This is what might\nbe described for lack of a better word, as\n'cultural' activities. Perhaps, you smile sardonically to hear of the Union publications,\nthe debating society* the political and religious societies, etc. called 'cultural' \u2014 as\nwell you might smile sardonically \u2014 but at\nleast you know what I mean. Chacun a son\ngout and all that it might well be better for\nthe health, getting fresh air and exercise, playing cricket or rugby, but ideas are not to be\nsniffed at. When all is said and done, it is\nthe ideas men hold that influence society\nmore than anything else. I am convinced\nthat there are a very large number of Union\nmembers who are interested in discussing\npolitics, religion and philosophy and that we\nshould be making greater efforts to extend\nfacilities for these things\nCollege activities go up and down: one\nyear a particular society is in excellent shape,\nthe next it isn't so good perhaps (excepting\nthe rugby club, which always seems to be\ngood). So what of this year Well, I think\nit has been an extremely good year. This\nis perhaps partly due to our current President Whose injection of transatlantic pep has\nbeen an object lesson to observe. Hardened old\nhand as I might be, I have been most impressed by his seemingly boundless enthusiasm. He has not got his own way over every-thing, but then how many of us do?\nHe has been particularly good about the\nnew Halls of Residence. It is important to\nsee that when they are opened the Union\nshould have a fair say in running them. It\nwould be a thousand pities if these institutions should be entirely run by the wardens,\nhowever well meaning the might be. Surely\nby the time a man gets to University he should\nbe capable of deciding his own likes and dis-likes. Hall spirit should arise by itself and\nnot from enforced aping of Oxbridge. The\neffect of the opening of Southside will be the\nmost important change the Union has to accommodate in the next year or so, and we\nmust show that we are capable of judicious\nmanagement of the new facilities.\nWhat the President and his Executive have\ndone this year is to keep the Union lovely.\nPerhaps that is the secret of a good Unionlife and zest. Nothing is worse than Union\nofficers who behave like natt e ring old grand-mothers. In a good Union one shouldn't sav:\n'What's on in the Union?' but rather, 'What\nisn't on in Hhe Union?' This has been a most\npleasant year, with initiative at a premium;\nlet us hope that next year will be as good,\nand if not, better.\nUNION\nREFECTORIES\nby DAVE WILBRAHAM\nThere is one aspect of life at I.C. which\nalmost none can avoid. Whether pink cherub\nfresher or battle-scarred post graduate all\nenter the refectories at some time or another.\nFor many this daily dose of masochism symbolises College life. I fear that for many it\nwill have left an ir radi cable imprint which\nwill bear dyspeptic fruit in future years. On\nthis point, and probably only on this point,\nvirtually all internees are agreed; the fodder\npurveyed in Mr. Mooney's Mashcatorium is\nof a standard wanting close sur vil lance by\nby the vigilantes gastronomic of the Public\nHealth Department.\nWhy should the refectory food earn this\nunpleasant description? Familiarity breeds\ncontempt, but I have found that uninitiated\nfriends quail at their baptism. It cannot be\nlack of choice, as there is usually a choice\nof some half-dozen dishes; order your indigestion to taste. The starting product is re-as on able, the finished product is sometimes\npalatable, the damage is done between the\nend of preparation and the beginning of con-sump tion. Plates holding full meals are sucked one\non another and stored under the hot plate.\nPeas dry out, shrivel and set rigid so that\nthe only use they are fitted for is pebble-dash-ing the President's Office. Chips go greasy,\nsoggy, grey and end up like sleeping slugs.\nMeat became s parched< gravy ends up as\ndark ir remove able stain. The only way to av odd this ruination of food is to alter the\nserving system.\nWhy not select a meat course from a pile\nand then select vegetables which could be\nserved directly from vats? Thus the vegetables could be preserved in a pre nen table state.\nWho knows, it might even be possible to\nhave a Mooney meal without peas and without a grey undercooked half tomato. Anyone\nwho has eaten at the many College refectories operating under this system w j ll know\nthat this method vastly improves the quality\nof vegetables and allows the customer a more flexible choice.\nThe usual cry which meets this suggestion\nis 'lack of counter space'. This is rubbish.\nThere is a very large refectory in an unmentionable .building in Bloomsbury which\nserves vast numbers of meals to equally vast\nnumbers of students and uses this system of\ndispensation with less counter space than\npresently existing in the lower refectory. The\nonly alteration \"necessary would be the removal of the central pillar. The puddings\ncould be laid out in a much smaller space,\nwith one attend ent to replenish supplies. One\nperson could dispense meat, one variously\ndisguised potatoes and one vegetables. Four\nservers; not an inordinately expensive labour\nbill if it meant improvement in quality, and\nsatisfied customers. Or am I right in wondering ir the Mooney Monopoly feels it need\nnot consider such irrelevancies as a service\nto the customer?\n\n"

    "content": "- 8 FELIX\nRUGBY CLUB\nBOOZE-UPS IN BE LG TUM HOCKEY CLUB\nHOCKEY CLUB TOUR by T. PHILLIPS\nThe Hockev Club finished their se is on by\nentertaining the Forward Hockey Club from\nGroningen University over Easter. After\nthree days in London both teams went to\nthe Lowestoft Hockey Festival. The first day\nin London started with lu nci h at the Queen's. Then we had a match at 'Harlington \u2014 they\nwon 2-1 \u2014 followed by a Mooney banquet\nand a Garden Hall stag party. Too much\nfor some, but the Stronger men (most of\nthem Dutchmen) managed to get up for lunch\nnext day and see London in the rain. Two\nidiots even played golf and. got soaked, but\nsome smuggled whisky kept them alive. That\nnight Garden Hall saw one of its finest par-ties. Those Dutchsren were rather charming,\nbut there were some girls left for us. Thursday was to have been occupied by a nice\nquiet sleep in the coach on the way to Lowesltoft. But they wanted to play again. We\ndidn't have a goalie, so they gave us one;\nhe was a left wing really. The score was 6-2\nto them with fifteen minutes to go. It was\nsuggested that our skipper move from let t back to right wing w l here he would be less\nin the way. He got two goals and made a couple more, but they scored again. So we\nlost 7-6. What a game!\nWe got some sleep the first night at Lowestoft. The skipper picked the team and went\noff to play golf. The first match was lost,\nbut it was a good game. That night the hospitality of the Suffolk and Khe Royal were\nenjoyed, but our landlady didn't enjoy the\nresult. You can't take these soccer players\nanywhere. The team P.R.O. had to pacify\nher next morning, then we went off to play\nLeicester University. The skipper had hurt\nhis knee (dangerous game this hockey) and\ncouldn't play for the rest of the Festival; he\ncouldn't even play golf so he must have been\nhurt badly. We should have beaten Leicester,\nbut we drew 3-3. I reckon we'd have lost if\nthat loud-mouthed idiot on the touch line hadn't given us so much encouragement. It's nice\nto have supporters. I'm sure I 've seen that\nfemale umpire somewhere. We went to a hop that night- The Entertainments Chairman\nwasn't very impressed \u2014 a frightful crush.\nThe Landlady didn't complain again: we\nweren't all that bad really. The sun shone\nagain next day, three days in a row; sure jy it would rain on Monday. We drew again\n\u2014 why can't someone score i some goals?\nMonday was the last day. We had to play\ntwo games, a 'nd the sun shone yet again.\nThe only committee member in the morn-ing's team was the treasurer, so we won for\na change. We scored three goals. That soccer\nplayer was a bit rude to the umpire, though\n\u2014 hardly the festival spirit. We lost again\nin the afternoon, but it was very close. The\numpires were a bit partial. Fancy one ot\nthem saying \"Further into their half, Harry\"\nto their centre-half when he was about ;o take a free hit. Pity that soccer player wasn't playing.\nIt was a wonderful weekend, everyone en-i oye d themselves. No-one got to see the fishing fleet come in after all, but you can't do\neverything, can you?.\nWhy don't you play hockey next year?\nTwenty two members of the Rugby Club\nleft Victoria en route to Belgium on March\n26th. The British Railways underestimated our\ncapacity and all the bottled beer had been\nconsumed before the train was an hour out\nof Victoria.\nIn Brussels we were met b va little man\nwho turned out to be M. Teddy Lacrois, the\nSecretary General of the Belgian Rugby\nUnion. He was to be our guide for the tour.\nHe informed us that the landlord of the hotel\nwe have been booked to stay in had passed\naway so he had arranged for us to stay at\nanother hotel.\nSoon it was decided to set up a kitty of\n5 Fr. each to be given to the first person who\nfound Belgian beer too much for him. This\nwas won about three hours later by Alan\nHavard.\nFor our first game, on arrival at the ground\nwe could see nothing resembling.a pitch except a large piece of white ground with white\nlines on it. This proved to be the pitch as\nafter changing the Belgian boys appeared\nwith some appropriately painted poles which\nthey erected as goal posts. Despite a storm\nduring the game and the fact that a public\nfootpath ran across the pitch, we had quite\nan enjoyable game and won by 62 pts. to 0.\nOne try was scored from a short penalty\nafter Alan Smith had slowly ambled through\nthe opposition holding the ball over his head\nand watched by everyone else in sheer amaze-ment.\nThe net morning we were invited to the\nMartini Bar. Within an hour 130 Martinis\nwere consumed, with the youngest member\nsetting the pace at 14,\nThat evening our hosts were the Sporting\nClub of Brussels. This side contained 7 new\nfull internationals and is one of the strongest in Belgium. Playing under floodlights we\nwon by 23-0, with 5 tries and 4 conversions.\nWe suffered the only injury of the tour during this game when Roger Place broke his\nnose and had to go to Hospital for two days,\nreturning like something out of an American\nSpace Rocket.\nAfter the game we were presented with an\nalmost life size model of \"The Mannekin\nPis\", which can be seen in the bar. We replied by giving S.C.A.B. an I.C. plague.\nOn Friday night it was decided to hold a tournament between all members of the party at the billiards type version of table soc-cer. This was supplemented by another tournament between Harry Robinson and Alan\nMorden and the local Bneweries. Morden\ngave up at about 10 and just on his 15th Robinson was struck down with a touch of\n\"rising stomach\". The other tournament finished at about 2 o 'clock when the party returned to the hotel b v devious routes. At one\nstage the South African member of the party\nfound himself in posse sion of the back of a 'disused\" park bench. After a slight disagreement about passports with the local constabulary most of us arrived back at 3 o 'clock.\nAt this hour the landlord arose, claiming\nunfairly, to have been disturbed in his sleep,\nand found Alan Havard asleep on the floor\nunder (his mattress and a pile of pebbles, etc..\nand his bed and the bed in the next room\nneatly stacked against the wall.\nOn Saturday we entertained S.O.S. St.\nGillis \u2014 Dendermoncle. This side had played\nonly once before, so we mixed the two teams\nfor the first half, and played normally in the\nsecond half. We won an enjoyable game by\n32 points to 0.\nSunday witnessed our last game versus Anderlecht. The opposition contained no fewer\nthan 8 internationals and the ensuing game\nresulted in a win for I'.C. by 33-10, of which\nDr. Hearn (Oggie) accounted for 22.\nAlan Smith had been christened by the\nHotel staff \"L 'enfant terrible\" and in view\nof this he was presented with a pair of plastic panties, which proved too large for him.\nso instead he was vested in a nappy and\nbrought down to dinner. The Lady of the\nHouse insisted on feeding her new \"enfant\"\nand was only just restrained from breast feeding him.\nThe sea on our return turned not a few\nstomachs, and we had to rescue the Treasurer\nfrom the Customs Officer. Thank God we\nescaped paying duty on Smith's blood.\n\"There has never been a tour like this\",\nwas the thought with which we left for home.\nJ MK E HOE THIS SPACE RESERVED\nFOR YOU!\nAdvertise in FELIX\nPublished b,?E LIX BOARD, Imperial College, London, S.W.7.

Their opposition was\ndrawn from the best in Great Britain, although foreign crews were encountered this\nyear, yet they acquitted themselves well.\nThree VIII's were entered for the\nReading University Head of the River Race\non 17th March, and these started in the positions attained by their equivalents last year.\nThus the first VIII started 4th, the second,\n21st, and the third, 46th. They fin shed7 th.40 th, and 76th out of a total entry of 145.\nTncidently. the race was won. in a tie, by\nthe University of London crew in a time just\n31 seconds faster than the 16 min. 25 sec.\nreturned by the first VIII for the 3J mile\ncourse.\nTwo weeks later, seven crews of I. C.B.C. took to their VIII's* together with nearly\ntih ree hundred others, for the 4\u00a3 mile Head\nof the River Race from Mortlake to Putney;\nthe hard facts are summarised in the table.\nBut for the gallants who started 294th, all\nthe College crews lost ground.\nIn their race on 14th April over the Same\nA\\ mile course, the scull ers M.E. Gaylard,\nJ. H. Ainsley and J. King were 30th,134 th, and 142nd respectively of 169 entries.\nThe term's results, although poorer than\nlast year's, are nevertheless praiseworthy. The\nvictory in the race for the Dixon Bowl has\nbeen reported, and at Reading the Club crews\nproved faster than not only all London col-leg es, but the fastest Oxford and Cambridge\ncolleges as well.\nHowever, if there are no grounds for dis-may, there are none for comp lec en cy either.\nThe club members are entering the summer\nregatta season with a determination to win and\nto enjoy themselves which is surely unmatched\nin any other club. Finally, as the club is\nsmaller than usual this year, it is finding it\ndifficult to provide enough support and encouragement for competing crews. Consequently, if you have any interest in the sport,\ncome and add your yells \u2014 and thirst \u2014\nto many others; we hope that you will find\nrowing so attractive that you will become a \"wet-bob\" yourself!\nCrew Start Finish\nHead of the River Race\nfrom Mortlake to Putney:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n12\n29\n92\n161\n169\n181\n16\n66\n103\n177\n236\n221\nTime\n19mj n.35se c.20m in.09 sec.20 min.27 sec.21 min. lOse c.2im in.51 sec.21 min.39 sec.29427322 min.47 sec.

Spud.\nSince last Monday, April 30th, there has\nbeen an exhibition of paintings and drawings by members of the I.C. Art Club on view\nin the Physics building, levels 2 and 3. This\nexhibition continues until next Thursday,\nMay 10th. Perhaps the Art Club needs some\nexplanation as some uninformed people claim\nnot to have heard of us. It is a club, sponsored\nand sub sidi sed by General Studies, whose\naim is quite simply to provide instruction\nin painting and drawing for members of\nImperial College. The lessons are held every\nWednesday afternoon in the Royal College\nof Art, during the first two terms of the year.\nAll this exhibits on show are of work\ndone during these classes, and it is best to remember this, for it explains and defines the\nlimitations of the exhibition. Firstly there is\nthe limitation of subject matter. We paint and\ndraw nudes almost all the time. To attempt\nto draw the human figure is difficult but\nonce you have begun to realise what is involved in trying to describe shapes in relation to surroundings and the light directed\nupon them, then you have begun to understand a little of what artists are trying to\ndo. Secondly there is the limitation of scope.\nWe do not paint finished masterpieces measured by the square yard. There just isn't time. Less than three hours per week is not\nlong enough to do anything near what we\nwould want, and much of the work we do\nmust of necessity be incomplete and sometimes sketchy.\nWe ac knowle ge these limitations but feel\nthat they enhance rather fi han detract from\nthe exhibition. Here are people like yourselves attempting to put down on paper what\nthey have seen, not often s uc ceding but always trying and gaining a great deal of\npleasure in the process. We hope that you\nin turn may derive pleasure from looking :\n>\n.\nt these exhibits, comparing and contrasting, realising the problems that are involved and\nthe very real excitement that is to be gained\nfrom painting and drawing.\nIf you are at all interested in these classes,\nplease get in touch with me, Tony Musgrave.\nthe Art Club secretary, for full details of\ntimes and places. From Wednesday. May\n2nd, we are holding summer out door sketching classes, and the usual classes at the\nCollege of Art restart next October.\nIf.
