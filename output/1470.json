    "content": "ELECTIONS\nFELIX\nFriday 22 October 2010\n22\nCurrently in my 2nd year on ICSMSU, I\u2019ve also\nbeen active in ICSM on music soc committee for 2 years whilst in orchestra. I\u2019ve rowed with\nICSMBC since coming to Imperial and last year\nperformed in Light Opera. These have helped me\nmeet many different people with different interests\nthroughout the medschool which is important as oftenthosewhosevoicesareheardloudestdon\u2019trepresent the majority. I want to ensure everyone\u2019s views\nare heard equally, not just at exec level but right\nwhere policy is made and refined in ICU Council.\nLast year\u2019s medical school conference highlighted just how lucky we actually are, for example in having the Reynolds, but also areas for\nimprovement. Organising Global Brigades trips\nand playing in sinfonietta, have given me experience working within IC to achieve common goals;\nso I\u2019m confident if given the chance, I would\nhelp further ICSM\u2019s best interests with them.\nAislinn O\u2019Malley\nCouncil Ordinary Member\nMEDICS\nGetting involved in being a representative of\nthe student body is something I\u2019ve always\nbeen enthusiastic about. I really like art, dance,\nmusic and water sports, and now that I\u2019ve come\nto Imperial I want to get involved in more than\njust academics or playing sport. I took part in my\nprevious school\u2019s council, which made me realise the importance of the student voice within\nan academic system. Student council should be a\nforum for discussion, where opinions from every\npart of the university should be heard and change,\nwhether small or radical, should be initiated by\nthe students. I feel that I am an approachable person to whom students will feel comfortable expressing their opinions, and who is outspoken\nenough to help make sure the union is run effectively with only the students best interests at heart.\nAlexandra Burke-Smith\nHi, my name is Hannah Tullett. I am a first-year\nmedic from Sussex, still getting to grips with\nLondon/lectures/ginned-up sports nights, all whilst\nbattling the dreaded fresher\u2019s flu! But I have found\nmy feet enough to run for the position of medical\nundergraduate representative, because I am passionate about giving you a voice. With two years\nof experience in a Sixth Form student union, I am\nup for the challenge of catering to the needs of a diverse group of individuals. As your representative\nI would be approachable and dedicated to making\nthe changes you want. This is your university, and\nI want you to be able to take into your own hands\nall efforts to make Imperial the best environment\nin which to study and play hard. Above all, I am\ncommitted to making your experiences at university as they should be: some of the best of your life.\nHannah Tullett\nHello, I\u2019m Steve. I\u2019m a fourth year Mechanical Engineer. I\u2019ve been involved in all sides\nof Union activity throughout my time at Imperial,\nadmittedly a lot has been the in the bar....but I\u2019ve\nalso been on the committees of a number of clubs,\nand last year I held a senior position in CGCU, so\nI\u2019ve seen the hard graft as well. I want to be a Council member so that I can continue to play a small\npart in trying to make life better for my friends and\nfellow students. As Council member, I should be\nrepresenting your views and interests, so if I give\na few of my views here, you can see whether we\nagree, and whether you should vote for me or not.\nI take a long term view to things, I consider the\nconsequences (immediate and potential) of actions,\nI\u2019m opposed to teaching standards and Student...\nSteve Long\nENGINEERS\nImperial College Union has an impact on all of\nour lives, whether it is through societies, welfare or simply cheap drinks! I owe a huge debt\nto the Union and feel that, in my fourth year, it\u2019s\ntime to repay some of that debt. The Council has\na vital role in determining the path that the Union\ntakes and ensuring that, like any other union,\nthe members are the priority \u2013 that means you!\nI ask for your vote because I am enthusiastic and passionate about making life at Imperial as good as it can be for everyone. My strong\nsense of right and wrong will enable me to\nstand up for our whole faculty, representing the\nunique opinions of Engineers across depart-ments. This year we can make the Union better\nthan ever, and I\u2019ll fight for you in Union Council.\nThomas Hills\nIwas a member of Union Council last year as\npart of my duties as the Welfare Officer for\nCGCU. Council members have a responsibility to ensure that policy passed by the Union\ndoes not have a detrimental effect on the students\nof Imperial and is representative of the views of\nthe students they act on behalf of. This is something I believe I was effective in doing last year.\nAs Mech Eng Dep Rep and an active member of\nImperial College Hockey Club, I am in an excellent position to understand the point of view of a\nlarge number of students within the Faculty of Engineering. I am also well placed to understand how\nUnion Policy could affect Engineering students.\nAlice Rowlands\nVoting closes at 23:59 on Monday 25th October\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\n\n"

He\nfeels that humanity\nwould never have invented science had it\nnot been for the ancient Greek custom\nof objective thinking,\nrationality and de-And a few suggestions...\nUpcoming Science Events\nOct 29th\nRoyal Society\nRevolutionary Insights \u2013 The Dawn of\nMicroscopic Investigation\n1pm \u2013 2pm\nOct 28th\nUCL\nBreast Screening; Some Inconvenient Truths\n1:15pm \u2013 1.55pm\nOct 26th\nRoyal Institution\nScience Question Time\n7pm \u2013 8.30pm\n\u00a38\nOct 28th\nWellcome Collection\nExchanges at the Frontier: Brian Greene\n3pm - 4.30pm\nOct 27th\nScience Museum\nScience of Bioterrorism (October Lates)\n6.30pm - 10pm\nbate. It\u2019s obvious from The Iliad that ancient\nGreeks valued skill in debate as much as skill\nin war. The Greek model of thinking and society\nare compared to other civilisations of that time\nincluding the Chinese, Indian and Hebrew to\nshow just how special the Greeks were and how\nprecious their discovery is. The conditions are\nspeculated on to explain the Greek success, for\nexample, the ancient Greeks lived in city states\ninstead of having one ruler that could oppress\nfreedom of thought. The book clearly influenced\nthe legendary populariser Carl Sagan as it is\nlisted in the references of a few of his books. It\nalso contains some of Cromer\u2019s other thoughts,\nnot all of which are as plausible.\nJakov Marelic\nThe study involved 10365 asthmatic individuals\nand 16,110 controls. It identified genes common in\nasthmatic individuals, which could be targets for\npotential future treatment. Many of these coded\nfor proteins involved in the immune system, particularly in T cells. It was also found that allergic\nreactions are associated with asthma, rather than\ncausing the disorder.\nThe work at Imperial College was overseen by\nthe GABRIEL consortium, an association of scientists from nineteen European countries, and was\npublished in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nThe group assessed over 500,000 gene muta-tions, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs), in each individual. This meant they could\nidentify single base changes which were common\nin people with asthma.\n5.4 million people in the UK are asthmatic, experiencing attacks where the walls of airways become\ninflamed and their passages constricted, causing\nwheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing. Heritability of the disorder has previously been shown\nto be 60%, indicating that there was some genetic\ncause. Allergies had been identified as a possible\ncause. This was because people with allergies had\nan increased risk of becoming asthmatic, and for\nsome, triggers of attacks can include allergens\nHowever, the study showed that levels of IgE se-rum, an indicator of allergies, had no link to asth-ma, and was in fact due to the same barrier protein\nfailures.\nAccording to Professor Miriam Moffatt, Professor of Human Genetics at Imperial College, \u201cWe\nnow know that allergies may develop as a result of\ndefects of the lining of the airways in asthma. This\ndoes not mean that allergies are not important, but\nit does mean that concentrating therapies only on\nallergy will not effectively treat the whole disease\u201d\nThe consortium had conducted a similar test of\nindividuals with childhood asthma \u2013 asthma in\npeople under 16 years old \u2013 but this study was\nover ten times bigger, and involved subjects with\nmore than one type of asthma. This showed that\nchildhood asthma has different genetic causes to\nlater onset asthma.\nThe previous study had shown that childhood\nasthma was strongly associated with genes on chromosome 17, this study identified specific genes associated with T helper cells and immune respons-es. Adult onset asthma, however, was shown to be\nmore influenced by a set of genes called the Major\nHistocompatability Complex (MHC).\nThis means that genetic tests can only identify\nthe risks of specific types of asthma, rather than\nan individuals\u2019 overall risk of acquiring the disor-der. However, identifying some of the root genetic\ncauses of asthma has opened up a range of possibilities for future treatments.\nWhile studying for finals I couldn\u2019t\nwork at home. The reason? My housemate claimed he couldn\u2019t study without\ndeafeningly loud music. Equally, many\npeople, (including the living legend that\nis DavidAttenborough), claim they can\u2019t\nwork with background music on. So, is\nmusic a help, or a hindrance to study?\nSurprise, surprise, the answer is \u2018it\ndepends\u2019. The type of music, age, sex\n(Funnily, men, on average, prefer to\nhave their music louder than women)\nand personality type all seem to affect\nwhether background music increased\nor decreased subjects\u2019 performance on\nsimple tasks. Scientific legend has it that\nclassical music increases intelligence.\nHowever, in simple tasks, participants\nthat choose their own music perform as\nwell as those listening to classical mu-sic, and both do better than those who\nprefer listening to heavy metal.\nWhile there is no evidence that background music directly improves performance on other complex tasks, people\ncompleting simpler tasks seem to benefit from it. In a paper teasingly entitled \u2018musical mnemonics induce brain\nplasticity and oscillatory synchrony in\nneural networks underlying memory\u2019researchers struck upon the breakthrough\nthat singing mnemonics to a tune helps\nyou to remember them. The tension-re-ducing effects of your favourite records\nmay have a more general positive effect\non performance, and singing and tapping along to music improves energy\nlevels. Is it any wonder that having the\nradio on is standard on production lines,\nyet somewhat frowned upon in offices?\nSo how to best utilise the power of\nmusic to keep you going? If you\u2019re\nlearning something particularly hard, it\nis better to study in silence. If you feel\nyour energy levels dropping, it might be\ntime to get dancing and singing along to\nsomething. Keep the volume down, and\nthe music will relax you more. Choose\nmusic because you like it, not because\nyou think Mozart will make you smarter.\nAnd whatever you do, don\u2019t live with\nhousemates who like heavy metal.\nAnna Perman\nDoes\nmusic\nhelp you\nstudy?\n\u201cFunnily, men, on\naverage, prefer to\nhave their music\nlouder than women\u201d\nGenetic study\nshines light on\nasthma\nAnna Perman\n\n"

A restless mind, a head\nfull of ideas, and the man\nreally doesn\u2019t like religion.\nSometimes, his work is a bit like the dialogue in \u201cThe Barbaric Beast of Boggy\nCreek\u201d \u2013 he seems to repeat one and the\nsame thing over and over again. The\nman really, really doesn\u2019t like religion.\nDid I mention that he repeats that idea\nover and over again??\nWe all know he is doing it only because of the money. That\u2019s just the way\nstuff goes. To be rich and famous, you\nhave to invent some image for yourself,\nand make it sufficiently unrealistic to\nbe entertaining and believable. When\nChristina Aguilera realized that copying Britney Spears isn\u2019t the way to make\na million, she changed her image from\n\u201cLocker-Room Teen Chick\u201d into the\n\u201cDirty-Bad Girl\u201d. Everyone perceived\nthis as Christina finally showing how\nAlexander Khanin\nshe really is under the surface, because\nwhen someone changes his/her image,\nit inevitably means that the new image\nis their \u201ctrue self\u201d. D\u2019OH!! When will\npeople realize that a \u201ctrue self\u201d does not\nexist, it is a myth invented by silly esoteric psychological advice books.\nAnd yes, Richard Dawkins is just like\nthat. Like Christina Aguilera, Green\nDay, Borat, the Village People, and basically everybody else. His image just\nhappens to be \u201cThe Atheist Dude\u201d. He\nhas found his niche, and is making serious money with it. I mean, the guy is\nselling goddamn T-SHIRTS on his web-page. So you have Chuck-Norris-divided-by-Zero T- Shirts, and now Dorkins\nAtheist T-Shirts.\nThose are a part of that whole \u201cOUT\u201d\ncampaign, where The Atheist Dude\nfights for the rights of poor, oppressed\nAtheists of the world. Maybe Dawkins\nis a hopeless idealist with serious delusions (no pun intended) about the world,\nand/or he is simply a guy who has figured out which sort of image will bring\nhim the nicest salary. And now he is\nbound to write silly books on that sub-ject, be featured in all sorts of documen-taries, magazines, sitcoms and all that.\n\u201cHey kids! I\u2019m Professor Dawkins! I really do not like religion! I really, really\ndo not like...\u201d\nYeah ok, we understand. Dude. Just\nrelax. But yeah, if Dawkins actually\nwrote a book WITHOUT mentioning\nhis goddamn view on that topic, then all\nof his fanboys and girls would be disap-pointed, and consider him a sellout...\nBased on the scientific evidence, we\ncan say with a large probability that\nRichard Dorkins is an asshole. I would\nalso like to objectively point out that\nChuck Norris T-Shirts are much better\nthan The Atheist Dude & Friends TShirts. And yes, I\u2019m an Atheist myself.\nStick THAT in your pipe. Would you\nlike fries with that?\n\u201cHey kids! I\u2019m\nProfessor Dawkins!\nI really, really do not\nlike religion!\u201d\nLetters\nDear Sirs,\nI\u2019m writing to complain about the\ncaption \u201cMexican Prisoner defeated\nby new security measures\u201d in Felix\nnewspaper.\nAs a Mexican I can say that the picture lacks of any sense of humour, and\nit reinforces the clich\u00e9s that people\nhave about a difficult situation that is\nhappening there.\nConsidering that we are in one of\nthe best universities in the world I\nam really disappointed about the bad\nquality of Felix. Moreover, I\u2019m surprised that the Editor had approved\nthis caption which does not have any\ncontent.\nIf you want to write an article about\nthe situation between the border of\nMexico and USA it is fine, but you\nhave to discuss it in a deep way and\nnot just showing stuff that does not\nhave any content.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 22 October 2010 11\nSCIENCE\n\u2018Would you like to see my lab before\nyou go?\u2019We looked at each other, thinking \u2018hell yeah!\u2019 The opportunity to see\nthe inner workings of some of the most\ncutting-edge work taking place in optics\nis not lightly passed up. We were on the\n9th floor of the Blackett Laboratory to\ninterview Chris Phillips, Professor of\nExperimental Solid State Physics and\nthe Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences.\nComing to Imperial to complete a PhD\nafter finishing his undergraduate degree\nat Cambridge, Professor Phillips has\nbeen a member of the department since\n1979. Actually, that\u2019s not strictly accu-rate, since his lack of confidence in his\nacademic abilities led him to a stint as an\nengineer for the BBC. This was not to be\na long-lived career as a year after leav-ing, he returned to Imperial as part of\nthe nationwide \u2018New Blood\u2019 scheme designed to reinvigorate the then-stagnant\nworld of academia.\nWe were curious about his job description as a Dean; as, it would seem,\nis the man himself. When asked, he said\n\u2018It\u2019s a difficult role to define... I\u2019m probably still learning.\u2019 As far as we could\nunderstand, the Deans are not part of\nthe formal management structure, but\nare more of an independent information channel. Their concerns range from\nmaintaining the high standards of fairness and equality integral to the college\nto the widespread dissatisfaction of the\nstudents. They also play a pivotal role in\nthe promotions process.\nHowever, the reason we came to interview Professor Phillips was to find\nout more about his research. He and his\nteam are experimenting with metama-terials, materials in which the structure\nat the microscopic level is engineered\nto give interesting macroscopic prop-erties. Applications of such materials,\nwhich rely on structural rather than\ncompositional properties, include the\nmuch-lauded \u2018invisibility cloak\u2019. Current research is focusing on super lenses\n(no pun intended), lenses that use the\nproperties of metamaterials to achieve\na negative refractive index. The refractive index of a material is the amount\nthat light bends when entering it from\nanother medium. Think of it like this;\na fish underwater appears closer than it\nactually is, but if the water had a negative refractive index, then the fish would\nappear to be floating above the surface.\nMaterials such as these have, as of yet,\nonly been theorised. Professor Philip\u2019s\nteam are approaching the problem from\na quantum mechanical angle, using Schrodinger\u2019s equation to calculate the electron transitions. Other groups are using\nnanoelectronics attempting to produce\nthe same effects.\nWhen we enter his lab, sidling nervously past the multiple warning signs\nand laser safety curtain, we are immediately confronted with a forest of instruments (if the trees were bonsais).\nA crowded optics bench occupies the\nmiddle of the room, bristling with mi-crometers, trace lasers and very expensive sensors, including as a centrepiece a\n\u00a360,000 infrared camera from a jet fight-er. This setup, balanced on old Vespa\ninner tubes, is used to work on mid-in-frared laser technology, the applications\nof which are not immediately obvious.\nHowever, the applications are even\nmore promising than those of the super\nlens; the group are using the technology\nto take \u2018chemical pictures\u2019 of organic\ncompounds. They hope that this will allow for a more quantitative approach to\ntissue sample analysis. Instead of purely\nqualitative method, where pathologists\nmake judgement calls on a sample under\na microscope, the new methods would\nallow for a numerical output, which can\nthen be compared to an index. The most\nobvious application would be in the diagnosis of cancers. Prognoses and life\nexpectancies could be given much more\naccurately.\nImperial Profile: #1\nProfessor Chris Phillips\nSolid State Physics\nAn important point Professor Phillips\nimpressed on us was the distinction between the undergraduate phase of learning and that in postgraduate research. As\nundergrads, we are merely consumers of\nknowledge; work is just work of no special importance. Postgraduate research,\non the other hand, is a creative process\nthat involves a large degree of personal\nexposure. When Professor Phillip\u2019s students attend conferences, they have to\nstand up and defend their work, to the\nsame degree as a poet their poem or\nan artist their painting. The work they\nare creating is not art, but the creativity involved is undeniable when seeing\nthe tangle of wires and the complex arrangement before us. A small shift, such\nas that caused by a finger, could set the\nteam back by six months, we were told\nas Adam hastily removed himself from\nthe vicinity.\nA common theme noticeable throughout the interview was Professor Phillips\u2019\npassion for communicating the science\nhe is involved with. \u2018We are creating\nnew knowledge, and what\u2019s more, we\nare doing it at someone else\u2019s expense.\nI feel we have a duty to give something\nback.\u2019 He frequently gives lectures promoting science around the country and\ninternationally, often including entertaining spectacles such as live music\nand fire-breathing. In 2006 his group\u2019s\nquantum optics research was selected to\nbe put on display by the Royal Society.\nFor two weeks they explained light, atoms and quantum mechanics to young\npeople, teachers and journalists.\nAt the end of our meeting, we were\nleft with the impression of a researcher\ndevoted to both his work and making\nscience accessible to all. It offered a tan-talising insight into the world that exists\nbehind the locked lab doors and laser\nsafety curtains of Imperial.\nIlse Daly\nAdam Falk\nGenetic study shines light on asthma\nImperial scientists may have finally unlocked the secrets behind schizophrenia.\nA disruption in brain signalling causes\nthe severe mental illness and promises\nexciting possibilities for drug develop-ment.\nChemicals in the brain known as neurotransmitters carry messages between\nnerve cells and are tightly regulated to\nensure the correct signals are transmit-ted. A recent study by James Stone et\nal. has shown for the first time that the\nabnormally high level of dopamine in\npeople with schizophrenia is due to a\ndisruption in the regulation of another\nneurotransmitter; glutamate. Glutamate is produced in the hippocampus\nregion of the brain and affects the activity of dopamine releasing cells in the\nstratum.\nDopamine targeted drugs have previously had limited success rates and serious negative side effects. Glutamate\nsignalling can now become the new\ntarget for anti-physcotic drugs and many\nexciting drug candidates are already in\nthe pipe-line. This cutting-edge research is bringing the possibility of a\ntreatment for schizophrenia ever closer.\nProfessor Chris Kennard, chair of the\nMRC Neuroscience and Mental Health\nBoard, said: \u201cStudies like these are helping to unravel the complex mechanisms\nof psychiatric illness and bring us a step\ncloser to more effective, targeted drugs\nfor patients with schizophrenia.\u201d\nSchizophrenia affects around 1% of\nthe population and is one of the most\ncommon and severe mental health illnesses but surprisingly little is known\nabout its causes and hence treatment is\nlimited. Previous work at Imperial into\nSchizophrenia has shown that music\ntherapy can improve some of the symp-toms, but there is a great need for improved drug treatment. Possible causes\ninclude genetic pre-dispositions, brain\ndamage during pregnancy, use of recreational drugs and stress. This greater\nunderstanding of what is going on will\nimprove not only treatment but also diagnosis of schizophrenia.\nKatie Tomlinson\n\n"

However, Sport Imperial are offering a discount to students on match tickets and\na Saturday afternoon at Loftus Road is\nenjoyable, exciting and affordable.\nRangers currently sit proudly at the\nsummit of the Championship, one of\nonly unbeaten teams in England this sea-son. Outspoken manager Neil Warnock,\nwhose Wikipedia contains a \u2018Disputes\u2019\nsection with over forty entries, has his\nteam playing an attractive and ambitious style of football, and he recently\nsuggested that \u201c[if] you don\u2019t enjoy\ncoming to QPR at the moment, there\u2019s\nsomething wrong with you.\u201d (Try telling that to rival clubs in the Championship, or indeed the QPR fan who had a\ndart planted in his chest by a Milwall fan\nduring crowd trouble at a recent match).\nWarnock has revived the career of\nmuch-maligned former Irish international goalkeeper Paddy Kenny, whom\nhe managed at Sheffield United. Kenny\nserved a nine-month ban last season after failing a drugs test but has deservedly kept ex-Spurs player Radek Cerny out\nof the team, conceding just three league\ngoals this season.\nThe majority of the credit for this fine\ndefensive record, however, has to go to\nthe QPR backline, many of whom carry\nPremier League experience. Older players like Mikele Leigertwood and Fitz\nHall have been complimented with\nfresher blood such as centre-back Matthew Connolly and on-loan Tottenham\nyoungster Kyle Naughton.\nMidfield anchor Shaun Derry has added the steely edge that Championship\nfootball requires, and is partnered in\nthe middle by Hungarian Akos Buzsaky\n(who boasts among his fans the manager\nwho brought him from Hungary to FC\nPorto, one Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho).\nWhat truly sets QPR apart from their\nrivals is their attacking threat. Young\nwinger Hogan Ephraim has delighted the\nLoftus Road faithful with his mazy runs\nand trickery and, despite having played\nat youth level for England, is thought to\nbe considering overtures from Republic\nof Ireland manager Giovanni Trapattoni.\nUp front, Heidar Helguson and Jamie\nMackie have been keeping the likes of\nRob Hulse, Patrick Agyemang and Tommy Smith out of the team. Helguson in\nparticular has added a physical dimension to Rangers\u2019 attack, while Mackie\u2019s\nwork ethic and goal-scoring ability have\nled to a call-up to the Scotland squad.\nThe undoubted star of the QPR team\nis Moroccan midfielder and vice-captain\nAdel Taarabt. Having impressed on loan\nfrom parent club Tottenham Hotspur last\nseason, Taarabt was signed for an initial\nfee of \u00a3600,000in the summer transfer\nwindow. Described as a \u2018genius\u2019 with\n\u2018frightening skill\u2019 by Harry Redknapp,\nthe 21-year-old was nonetheless unable to break into the first team squad at\nSpurs and his relationship with his manager deteriorated as a result. He possesses speed, skills and vision in abundance,\nand under Warnock he has become the\ncreative fulcrum of the QPR team.\nFurthermore, QPR and Imperial have\nestablished a relationship which, in addition to cheaper tickets, allows the club\nto train at the college\u2019s facilities at Harlington , and the men\u2019s football team are\ngiven regular access to the club\u2019s coaching staff.\nSo while a trip to QPR make lack the\nglamour of a Premier League fixture, it\nis nonetheless an opportunity to watch\npleasant football in a cheap, friendly and\ncomfortable environment.\nAn ode to Queen\u2019s\nPark Rangers, because\nsomeone has to do it\nHugh McDowell\n\u201c\nment, there\u2019s\nnt, th\nu.\u201d (Try tell.\u201d (T\ne Champione Cham\nn who had a\nn who h\na Milwall fan\nMilwa\n\u201d\ngiv\ngi\ning\ning\nS\nS\ngla\ng\nis\nA Saturday afternoon\nat Loftus Road is\nenjoyable, exciting\nand affordable\nAcross\n1.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX Friday 22 October 2010 17\nRajat Jain\nIt could be worse; we could be in France\nBritish economic cuts may pain us now, but the French failure to reform will hurt them more\nBritain\u2019s first coalition government since\nthe Second World War seems to be splitting at the seams as it unveils a budget to\ndeal with the worst deficit caused by the\nworst recession in Britain since the Second World War. This has already caused\na twenty four hour tube strike and back-bench anger over broken party pledges.\nWe can, however, at least take solace\nin the fact that we appear to be coping\nbetter than the other half of the entente\ncordial; our sister nation, France.\nPresident Sarkozy\u2019s plan to increase\nthe retirement age from 60 to 62 has, to\nput it lightly, triggered popular discon-tent. The parallels with Britain, like so\nmuch of Franco-British history of the\npast century, are clear; a right-of-centre\ngovernment bringing in major economic\nreform, including increasing state pension age from 65, at a time of economic\ncrisis, triggering civil unrest. This is,\nhowever, where the similarities end.\nThese are major protests; the sixth day\nof nationwide strikes and protests, each\nattracting about 1m to 3m to the streets,\nin two months has been coupled with\na week-long blockade of oil refineries.\nThe French economy, without petrol and\ntransport, is grinding to a halt. France\n(or Paris, at least) has a long history of\nstrikes bringing down governments- or\nat least causing embarrassing policy Uturns in the case of 1995 and 2006 reform attempts; Baron Hausmann even\ndesigned the city around protest power.\nFrance has never had a Thatcherite figure to control trade union power effec-tively.\nThe relative economic unrest should,\nall the same, seem surprising; Britain\u2019s\nbanking based economy fared worse in\nthe financial crisis- it came out of recession six months after France (with\nhigher decline in every quarter) and its\ndeficit is about 11% GDP compared\nwith France\u2019s 7%. However, the strangest and perhaps most telling statistic\nis that strikers have more than 70%\nof popular support, yet oddly up to\n70% of those polled also support pension reform. Unemployment in France\nhas also hit a staggering 10%, and its\nNational debt remains at over 70%-though these were recurrent problems\nin France before recession, which perhaps shows the big difference between\nthe two nations.\nThe problem for France is not about\ncuts to balance the books and the discontent is not purely about pension\nreform. While Britain\u2019s newly elected\ngovernment deals out temporary measures to deal with urgent but short term\nproblems, France is dealing with both\neconomic and social problems that have\nbeen around for decades and were meant\nto dealt with by a president that has been\nin power for over three years now.\nMr Sarkozy was always likely to be a\ncontroversial radical; he showed views\nwhich, liberal or conservative, were certainly not Populist. He said the French\nmust work more and face less job secu-rity; openly complimenting the AngloSaxon economic model. He even went\nso far as to say France showed \u201carrogance\u201d to not see that we were all the\nfounders of liberty. As minister of the\ninterior, he supported the founding of\na Muslim Council in France to address\ntheir needs effectively and suggested\nthe state should subsidise mosques to\nfurther integration yet also called Arab\nrioters in 2005 \u201ctraitors\u201d. On entering\noffice promised to create a more dynamic French economy, a more tolerant\nsociety and assert France as a power for\ngood on the world stage (even bringing\nthe socialist founder of Medecins sans\nFrontiers in as Foreign Secretary as an\nolive branch).\nThis is a far cry from what has hap-pened. While he has reduced some\nunion strike power and maintained\nthe right to work long hours to maintain labour flexibility, he failed push\nthrough enough reform earlier to control unemployment effectively. When\nthe USA and UK seemed to be bearing\nthe brunt of world recession, he did a\nmajor U-turn and claimed French economics was right all along, making any\neconomic reform hypocritical. The\ngovernment also introduced a ban on\nthe burqa and brought France back into\nNATO (an Anglo-Saxon dominated\nmilitary system is anathema to many\nof those across the French political\nspectrum); both moves, regardless of\nnational support were not policies he\nwas voted in for. To top off his feeble\nattempts at political reforms, corruption charges are emerging; scandalous\nclaims have been made over his relationship with the L\u2019Oreal family, an\nW\nednesday\u2019s Spending Review brought\nwith it the news,\nmuch speculated\nand feared in this\npaper, that science spending would itself face cuts. The research budget will\nbe frozen, which means a real terms cut\nof 10%; about \u00a3500 million. This may\nnot sound like too much but it comes at\na time when countries like America and\nGermany are increasing research spend-ing, seeing it as key to continued economic growth. Our own business school\nat Imperial recently produced at report\nshowing how investment in science research leads directly to growth in other,\nseemingly unconnected, sectors.\nBut the government says that cuts\nmust be made and that for the sake of\nfairness, science must suffer too. This\nmight seem, well, fair. But look at what\nhas not been cut for fear of public out-cry, and scientists might have reason to\ncry foul.\nCuts to the welfare budget never\nsound fair. Welfare is supposed to be\nfor the worse off in society, people who\nwould most likely go homeless and hungry without benefits. But welfare under\nNew Labour extend much beyond this,\nand with intelligent cuts the poor can be\nspared any pain; and science could well\nbe too.\nPoliticians, for all their perceived confidence on the podium, are timid crea-tures. Often, instead of fighting their\ncorner, it is tempting to give in to tabloid headlines and instant public reac-tion. This is exactly what has happened\nover the increasingly expensive freebies\nhanded out by the previous administration to the elderly. The government currently hands out free bus passes and TV\nlicenses to the elderly, as well as generous winter fuel allowances.\nThe only requirement for these benefits is age; they are paid to the impov-WELFARE\nCUTS\nCOULD\nPAY FOR\nSCIENCE\nerished and millionaires alike, resulting\nin the bizarre situation wherein all pensioners receive a winter fuel allowance\naimed at fighting the fuel poverty faced\nby only 20% of them. The same applies\nto the bus passes and TV licences; pensioners receiving for free services for\nwhich they could, by and large, easily\npay.\nBy making these benefits means\ntested, instead of universal, George Osborne could ensure that no pensioners\ngo without travel, TV or central heating this winter (the original intention of\nthe benefit) while saving a whopping \u00a39\nBillion pounds.\nNo doubt the Left will be quick to accuse the chancellor of robbing poor pen-sioners; even though he isn\u2019t. Osborne\nicon of chic French industry.\nRegardless of what we may think of the\ndetails of the cuts in Britain, the Conservatives have, by and large, showed that\nthey have every intention of carrying out\nprecisely what they were voted in to do.\nThe French president, on the other hand,\nhas spent three years alienating enough\nof his populace to make the desperately\nneeded economic reform, which he was\nvoted in for, almost impossible to push\nthrough.\nThese protests, it seems, are long\noverdue. While it is now certain that the\npension reform will go through parliament regardless of the protests, the Indian Summer of Sarkozy\u2019s presidential\nterm is well and truly over.\nwill still be reeling from his declaration that child tax credit would become\nmeans tested; he was roasted for hurting\nfamilies, despite poor families keeping\nthe credit. Perhaps here scientists, used\nto the struggles of convincing the public of evolution and vaccines, can em-pathise with the chancellor\u2019s struggle to\nwin the public around from their gut re-actions. But his failure to address unnecessary benefits can only mean yet more\ncuts in other departments. If he took the\nleap and means tested pensioner give-aways, science could keep its budget\nand cuts across other departments could\nbe reduced from 19 to 14%, according\nto the Institute of Fiscal Studies. That\nknowledge, if nothing else, should give\nhim courage.\nRORY FENTON\n\u201cPoliticians, for all their perceived confidence on the podium, are timid creatures.\u201d\nNot the only one being screwed\nby Sarkozy It looks like there\u2019s a big chicken nugget drunking a beer on the right...\n\n"

The first years need a rep-resentative, and they want some of their ideas to be\nput forward to the committee, and I want to be that.\nIf I get elected, I will make a Facebook group\nfor students who have ideas and I will listen\nto suggestions and feed them to the commit-tee.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 22 October 2010 9\nFEATURE\nS\norin Cioban and Mihaela Rosca, of Tizard\nand Garden Hall respectively, proved to\nbe a pair of friendly and surprisingly energetic Computing students. Whilst slightly apprehensive at being interviewed for Felix, they\nnonetheless expressed their delight at all the\nevents that had been organised in their halls.\nA particular highlight was the carnage that\nensued during the Southside Olympics. Sorin\nwent for his first-ever flight with the Gliding Society last Sunday \u2013 he says that for a yearly\nmembership cost of \u00a340 plus around \u00a325/\nflight (each lasting 25 minutes), the society offers an excellent deal. Mihaela was less than\ncomplimentary about the food on campus.\nAlthough in general she found the food good,\nher complaints focused on the amount of fast\nfood and the ubiquity of potatoes, reminiscent\nof Monty Python\u2019s love of spam. Felix advised\nventuring on a (God-forbid!) five minute walk\noutside the microcosm of Prince's Gardens to\ntry some finer (but more expensive) eateries.\nLess than three weeks ago, a swarm of fresh-faced and youthful 18 year olds landed at Imperial with more hopes and dreams than Barack Obama. Freshers' week has since passed,\nleaving in its wake a thousand hangovers, fewer virgins, and the six people that attended Lee\nNelson\u2019s stand-up gig. Felix took to the streets to find the few unwashed first years that were\nnot suffering from some strain of freshers' flu. We gauged their reactions to the first days of\nthe best years of their lives.\nCommemoration Day took place on Wednesday, with over 2,000 undergraduates receiving\ntheir degrees in science, engineering and medicine at the Royal Albert Hall. The relieved\ntwenty-somethings flaunted their gowns (but no mortarboards or degree certificates) as they\nshook the hand of the rector. We went in search of the thoughts of these cheery graduates\nwhilst their proud parents looked on misty-eyed as their children had finally made it into a\nFelix feature article.\nFRESHERS GRADUATES\nVIEWS OF IMPERIAL\nT\nhe Eastside Bar is where we found this\npair of (identical?) Chemistry students\nfrantically trying to finish a lab report due\nin ten minutes. Positively beaming about their\nexperiences at Imperial, they\u2019re ecstatic to be\nliving in London with its wealth of attractions\nand vast mix of international students. Daniel\ndescribed his attendance at a boat party with\nFalmouth Hall as great fun with good music\nand plenty of booze. Felix was glad to see\nFreshers with the ability to recognise the important things in life.\nF\nelix stumbled into this Fresher finishing off\nhis meal-deal lunch in the Queen\u2019s Tower\nRooms. Living it up in Selkirk hall, he was\npleasantly surprised by the efficient organisation of events in his hall and has so far had an\nenjoyable time at Imperial. Surprisingly, he says\nthe girl:boy ratio is better here than at similar\ncourses in his home country. Whilst that may\nbe, Felix continues to extend its sympathies to\nthe gentlemen of the Department of Computing\n(and also, come to think of it, the ladies of the\nDepartment of Computing.)\nJ\nairo Jaramillo has completed a 4-year\ndegree in Mechanical Engineering with\nNuclear Energy, and is now working for\nan energy management company in the UK.\nBefore coming to Imperial, he spent a year\nat Oxford. He claims that the engineering\ncourses are superior at Imperial, however Oxford wins hands down on the social front. He\nfondly remembers one materials lecturer who\nexplained that the Japanese used to produce\nstrong steel swords by ramming molten-hot\nblades up the rear\u2019s of naughty children (nowa-days, they just use a bath of cold water- that\u2019s\ncalled progress). Jairo does have an issue with\ngirls at Imperial who have an elevated opinion\nof themselves. A consequence of the basic\neconomic principle of supply and demand, a\nfive-pinter can progress to a two-pinter at Imperial. He also wishes the medics would integrate more with the rest of the university.\nK\naraiskos Efthymios and Ben Jones\nhave completed a 4-year course in\nElectrical Engineering. Ben, now studying Integrated Design Engineering at the Royal College of Arts, spent his 4th year at Santa\nBarbara, California. He said that whilst Imperial was probably ranked in the top 5 universities in the world for the highest percentage\nof males, Santa Barbara had been ranked as\nthe number 8 place to go by Playboy Magazine. They feel that there is a lack of interdepartmental socialising at Imperial, and a\nreluctance for students to introduce themselves to one another at Union events. They\ndo however think that there is a misconception that Imperial is not a fun place to be. It\u2019s\nup to the students to make their university\ndays unforgettable.\nS\namuel Tournoff \u2018Esquire\u2019 (as he asked\nto be called), Andrew Slater, Derek\nChow, and Guy Leaver have all just\ncompleted a degree in Computing. This enthusiastic group are now all pursuing careers\ndirectly related to their course. An enrobed\nGuy was elated at being interviewed for Felix,\nand stated \u201cThis is the first time I have met\nsomeone from Felix during my entire degree,\nand I\u2019m dressed like a twat.\u201d Andrew was a\nmember of the cheese society. When Felix\nput it to him that a fresher had suggested\na potential unification with the wine club, he\nlooked aghast and declared that a long term\nmerger would not work \u2013 stating that his love\nof cheese was too great to be tainted by wine.\nGuy said he rather liked the idea of both wine\nand cheese.\nSorin Cioban and Mihaela Rosca enjoyed the events organised by their halls\nDaniel Bisley and Rafael Benitez-Cabral Niklas Hambreuchen\nKaraiskos Efthymios and Ben Jones\nSamuel Tournoff, Andrew Slater, Guy\nLeaver and Derek Chow\nJairo Jaramillo\n\u201cThey think that there is a misconception that Imperial\nis not a fun place to be. It\u2019s up to the students to make\ntheir university days unforgettable.\u201d\nAlex Karapetian & Charles Betts\n\n"

Fortunately Imperial were given\ntime to acclimatise to these after their first opponents failed to reach the tournament, resulting in an\nImperial walkover.\nThe first competitive game came that afternoon,\nagainst the Italian side Furie Romagnole. Building\non a morning of practice, the discDoctors played\nwell against a skilled side, grinding out long points\nto earn a victory. One hour later and Imperial returned to the pitch to play another Italian team,\nDelafia.\nThe discDoctors took victory by a comfortable\nmargin and prepared for the final game of the day\nagainst Mythago, the Bristol University team.\nKnowing the Bristol team well, Imperial scored\nseveral quick points to take the lead and, thanks to\nan impressive defensive showing by the dD girls,\nmaintained it to win the game.\nHaving won the group, Imperial progressed into\nthe second group stage of three highly-ranked\nteams. The Imperial team put in strong performances to dispatch another Italian team, Jacuzzi, com-fortably, before a crucial match against Lemmings,\nfrom Leamington Spa. Knowing that this team\nwere strong contenders in UK mixed tournaments,\nImperial were glad to take the early lead. The Lemmings rallied and scored several points without re-ply, giving them a one-point lead as time ran out.\nFortunately Imperial kept composure to level the\nscores, before winning the game by a single point.\nThe win put the discDoctors into the quarter\nfinals, against one of Germany\u2019s best women\u2019s\nteams, the Woodchicas. Imperial faced this team\nat the same point in the tournament last year but\na disappointing showing by the Woodchicas gave\nImperial an easy victory. Once again Imperial took\nan early 3-1 lead but, after some good early flow,\nbegan to capitulate and conceded six points without\nreply. The discDoctors replied by playing hard and,\nwith a wilful disregard for their bodies, fought back\nto draw level and once again took the game by a\nsingle point.\nThe Saturday night party took its toll on all the\nteams, but the discDoctors suffered not only from\nhangovers but also an incapacitating injury to the\neventual most-valuable player. The Sunday morning match saw the weakened Imperial team face the\nFelix Sport sponsored by\nSPORT\n22.10.10\nISSUE 1470\nSPORT\nHugh McDowell\nsings the praises\nof local football\nclub Queens Park\nRangers.\nPage 47\nMUSIC\nWe profile the\nImperial Physics\nGraduate who\nis now DJing at\nKiss FM.\nPage 28\nARTS\nArts celebrate the\nwork of Imperial\u2019s\nPhotosoc and\nthe fantastic\nimages they have\ncaptured.\nPages 27\nDiscDoctors\ntravel to Italy\nfor BURLA\nBeach Cup\ncontinued on page 45>>\nPhil Sandwell\nFalcons defeat\nFalcons defeat\nLions in\nLions in\ndoubleheader\ndoubleheader\n>> Page 45\nIce Hockey Feature\nPage 44\nFILM\nBetween a rock\nand a hard place\n- the rights for the\nChileans Miners\nstory rights\nPage 31\n\n"

    "content": "FASHION\nFELIX Friday 22 October 2010 33\nWelcome to London\nFashion Editor Saskia Verhagen lets rip at the most irritating of London\u2019s fashion\nstereotypes: boys in tight trousers and army boots, girls in Uggs and gilets beware!\nL\nondon is a quintessential\nfashion capital. Though we\ndon\u2019t have the edgy cool\nof New York, the elegant\nchic of Paris or the classic\nluxury of Milan, we have quirkiness\nand an extraordinary propensity to seek\noriginality, using every sartorial tool\nin the box to illustrate exactly who we\nare, consciously or not. What we have,\nunique to London, are more distinctive\nfashion districts than you can\nshake a stick at. In\nParis you have the right bank, and the\nleft. New York: uptown and downtown.\nIn London we have sartorial subsets\nthat range from Chelsea to Camden,\nShoreditch to Shepherd\u2019s Bush, Portobello to Primrose Hill.\nFor those who are strangers to London, I will seek to elucidate the signatures of two of our most ubiquitous fashion sets: Chelsea and Hoxton. The point\nis not to identify yourself\nwith either of\nthem \u2013 heaven forbid! \u2013 just be armed\nwith the knowledge that they both exist,\nin various degrees of extremity, and you\nhave my permission to sniff smugly at\ntheir generic conformism: a crime that\na true London fashionista would never\ncommit.\nCommonly known as Sloanes, after the\nChelsea hub of Sloane Square, this lot,\nwith their Ugg boots and Barbour jackets\nin tow, have managed to disperse themselves up and down the country, which\nis fairly unfortunate for the rest of us.\nThe look: Inspired by the greener\npastures outside of the M25, this\nis what happens when the middle\nclasses of the Home Counties\nmove to London.\nThe girls: She seemingly\nhasn\u2019t quite gotten over the\nloss of her pony and so tries\nto emulate that muddy,\nblustered look of a long\nday of dressage with matted hair (it\u2019s actually highlighted by a very expensive hairdresser in Mayfair,\nand has had that messiness\ncarefully created by a well-refined blend of various sprays,\nlotions and potions) and smudged eye-liner. The daily uniform is tights, Uggs,\ndenim and a jumper emblazoned with\neither their school or sport of choice.\nWorse specimens wear pyjama bottoms,\nand favour a Puffa gilet to the more traditional coat in the winter months. Don\u2019t\nforget the pashmina.\nThe boys: Flip-flops, whatever the\nweather, is a classic hallmark. Combine\nthese with a wardrobe composed of Jack\nWills and Abercrombie/Hollister. His\ncollar is always turned up and contrary\nto his true country counterpart, his hair\nis long and side-swept; a true country bumpkin keeps his hair short and\nfunctional, not needing to run his hand\nthrough it every 5 minutes, to maintain\nthat perfect side parting.\nWhere to find them: Listen out for\nshouts of \u201cArabella!\u201d or \u201cTarquin!\u201d\noutside any of Mahiki, Boujis or The\nBrompton Club.\nWhat happens when they grow up?\nNothing good. David Cameron and Kate\nMiddleton. I know.\nWelcome to East London.Aland where\nindividualism has run so rampant that\nit has managed to blur itself into a sea\nof hipsters bound by their rejection of\nall things mainstream.\nThe look: a better journalist than\nI once said that hipsterism \u201cfetishises the authentic\u201d elements of the\n\u201cfringe movements of the post-war\nera \u2013 beat, hippie, punk, grunge and\nregurgitates it with a winking inauthenticity\u201d \u2013 harsh words. All fashion is some kind of regurgitation\nand the London brand of hipster\njust tries too bloody hard.\nThe girls: androgynous haircut,\nfloral minidress, grandma\u2019s old\ncardi, ripped tights, plus/minus\nAmerican Apparel accessories and\nnon-prescription thick-rimmed\nglasses. She is usually dragging\non a cigarette whose brand you\u2019ve\nnever heard of. They\u2019re foreign, ap-parently. She loathes to admit that\nmummy and daddy are actually the\nowners of her Hoxton studio flat and\nthat though she pulls pints at the local,\nher allowance drops in on the first of\nevery month.\nThe boys: The classic white-boy\nafro. You know what I\u2019m talking about.\nTrousers perpetually tucked into boots.\nHis jumpers are too small and he wears\nwoolly hats on sunny days and sunglasses in the rain. He also got thrush once\nfrom wearing his trousers too tight.\nWhere to find them: Hanging out at\nthe grungiest bars of Dalston and Stoke\nNewington \u2013 Hoxton is too darn mainstream now you see, those pesky finance\ntypes are cramping their style and the\nrent and drinks prices have suddenly\nshot up. Check out The Moustache Bar\nand Dalston Superstore \u2013 at the very\nleast, the booze is pretty cheap.\nWhat happens when they grow\nup? They get a normal job. Something\nsickeningly conformist like advertising\nor PR.\nCHELSEA HOXTON\n\n"

Those praised for their unique lecturing techniques and willingness to help students\nwere Professor Anthony Bull (Department of Bioengineering), Professor Nigel Bell (Centre for Environmental Policy), Dr Frank Berkshire and Professor\nMartin Liebeck (both Department of Mathematics).\nThose awarded for Pastoral Care were Mrs Margaret Cunningham (Department of Computing) and Dr\nMike Emerson (National Heart and Lung Institute).\nIn yet another first for Commemoration Day, Stepan Lucysyzn of the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department became the first recipient of\nan Imperial Doctor of Science Degree, awarded for\n\u2018work of an exceptional standard\u2019\nSir Keith O\u2019Nions, overseeing his first ceremony\nas Rector, delivered a speech to new graduates\nabout the need to use their skills to benefit society.\n\u201cEducation is at the core of an enterprise which\nundertakes research at the cutting edge, translates\nit for economic benefit through new companies and\naddresses the big societal challenges of this era,\u201d\nhe said, to an audience who were no doubt highly\nanticipating the promised \u2018light canap\u00e9s\u2019 that would\nbe served at the following receptions.\nThe Rector left those in attendance with the final\nsummative message, \u201cThe collective contributions\nwe know you will make to the world is truly inspiring.\u201d\nMatt Colvin\nPostgraduate Wood Lane\ncampus approved\n\u00a328 million development given go-ahead by local council\nPlans for Imperial College London\u2019s development of a new postgraduate campus at Wood\nLane have gained impetus following their approval by Hammersmith & Fulham Council.\nThe Council\u2019s decision follows the sale of the\nBBC\u2019s 7.7 acre Woodlands site, previously occupied by BBC Worldwide, in September 2009.\nA \u00a328 million deal secured the location which\nImperial plans to use to create new teaching,\nresearch and administrative facilities alongside\nnew accommodation for 606 postgraduate stu-dents. The plans for the campus are certainly\nambitious, with a hotel, gym and pharmacy\nplanned amongst various other services, with\nthe intention of creating a major centre for\nscience, technology, medicine and business.\nThe College aims to complete the first stage\nof the development by September 2012 for\ninaugural postgraduate use in the 2012/2013\nsession. Combined with new postgraduate accommodation being built at Winstanley Road\nin Clapham Junction, the College hopes to\nachieve its ambition of \u2018providing accommodation for a quarter of postgraduate students\u2019.\nThe move is likely to appease some prospective postgraduate students who wish to\nseek an alternative to private accommoda-tion. Currently, Imperial admits that it has\na \u2018very limited\u2019 amount of accommodation\navailable for postgraduate students, with Imperial-managed Clayponds Village in South\nEaling housing 325 students and postgraduate campus Silwood Park home to just 126.\nIn a statement released by the BBC, Chris\nKane, Head of BBC Workplace, praises the\ndeal, stating that, \u201cWe are delighted to have\nachieved a sale which offers good value for\nour licence fee payers. The new occupier\nshares the BBC\u2019s values [and] reinforces the\ninnovative and creative culture of the area\u201d.\nDr Martin Knight, Chief Operating Officer of Imperial College London, said, \u201cThis\npurchase is an investment in Imperial\u2019s future growth and development. It will also allow us to extend provision of quality affordable student accommodation, particularly for\npostgraduates.\u201d He then cryptically added,\n\u201cWe look very much forward to collaborating\nwith the BBC on research and other projects.\u201d\nThe scheme was not approved without some\ncontroversy however, with CABE (Com-mission for Architecture and the Built Environment) slamming the project. They have\nstated that the sustainability targets for the\nproject \u201cdo not reflect Imperial College\u2019s\nreputation for excellence and innovation.\u201d\nSome local residents have also listed concern regarding the plans. The main worry\namongst the contingent is a fear that the development will lead to local estates (White City,\nWood Lane and the heroically named Batman Close) being demolished as part of the\nrejuvenation of the \u2018White City Opportunity\nArea\u2019, a scheme that is dedicated to bring new\njobs and investments to the surrounding loca-tion. One such benefit was the opening of the\nWestfield London shopping centre in 2008.\nBoth parties involved in the deal deny that this\nis the case, with JohnAnderson, Project Director\natImperial,sayingthattheproject\u2018\u2018offersarange\nof uses that will benefit the local community\u201d.\nAlongside this, the BBC claim that \u201cit is working in partnership with landowners to build on\nthe area\u2019s existing strengths and bring about the\neconomic development of the White City area.\u201d\nMatt Colvin\nPhoto by Christopher Walmsley\nPhotos by Christopher Walmsley\nCommemoration Day\n(Left to right) Physics Graduate Abi\nBroadbent, The Royal Albert Hall in full flow\nand Union President and Biology Graduate\nAlex Kendall speaking\n\n"

    "content": "A R T S\nFELIX\nFriday 22 October 2010\n26\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cI call our world Flatland, not because we call it\nso, but to make its nature clearer to you, my happy\nreaders, who are privileged to live in Space.\u201d Such\ndoes A. Square, the affable two-dimensional protagonist of Edwin A. Abbott\u2019s Flatland, begin his\nnarration. Over the following pages there unfolds a\ntruly unique work of fiction; perhaps not the great-est, but certainly one of the most original books\never written. Published in 1884, Flatland is plainly\na book of two halves: the first closely concerning\nthe social and political climates of the time, and the\nsecond completely transcending them.\nIn the first, the novel constitutes a brilliantly\nscathing social satire. Powerful Victorian prejudices\nare mirrored \u2013 and distorted \u2013 in Flatland. A wonderful example is the issue of angularity, a parody\nof Victorian class society. In Flatland, the polygonal shape of a man rigidly dictates, from birth, his\nsocial standing: the more numerous his sides, the\nhigher his class. Similar metaphors abound.\nThe social commentary is relentless and uninhib-ited, and as such the narrative grows somewhat\nsurreal, often verging on the ridiculous. All in all, it\nmakes for a fantastically entertaining romp. But the\nreal meat of the novel is to be found in the second\nhalf.\nThis kicks off the inter-dimensional dance with\nthe narrator\u2019s visit to a one-dimensional world,\n\u201cLineland\u201d. Interesting parallels can be drawn here\nbetween the two-dimensional creature\u2019s reaction\nto the constraints of one-dimensionality, and our\nthree-dimensional reaction to the restrictiveness of\na two-dimensional world. (And these parallels can\nbe extended yet further\u2026)\nMost interesting are the exchanges between the\nnarrator and a mysterious visitor from the third di-mension, the Sphere. The Sphere\u2019s immense troubles in trying to convey the \u201cTheory of Three Dimensions\u201d to the square highlight acutely the supreme\ndifficulty (perhaps \u201cimpossibility\u201d) of conceptualis-ing dimensions higher than one\u2019s own.\nThe real significance of Flatland, of course, is how\nit relates to us. Thinking about the hugely limiting\nimplications of a two-dimensional life brings a wry\nsmile of superiority to our three-dimensional faces.\nBut we should not be so complacent. The narrator\u2019s plight can easily be translated into the third dimension (or the fourth, or the fifth). Flatland offers\nus the means to imagine \u2013 at least in some small,\nstunted sense \u2013 dimensions higher than our own.\nThat\u2019s why the book is so important, seeking to\n\u201carouse in the interiors of Plane and Solid Humanity\na spirit of rebellion against the Conceit which would\nlimit our Dimensions to Two or Three or any number\nshort of Infinity.\u201d\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nNavid Nabijou describes why this\nclassic Victorian novel is still such\nan exhilarating read.\nFlatland by Edwin Abbott\nWhich book do you love more than any other? Tell\nus why it\u2019s so good - Send 300 to 400 words to\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCold Hard Cash\nThe Frieze Fair is the glitzy international cattle market of\ncontemporary art, but what if you\u2019re not spending?\nAs a classical art enthusiast, I would be\nthe first to admit that I can be somewhat\npessimistic when it comes to contemporary art. Long have I held the somewhat\nclosed-minded view that a number of today\u2019s more renowned modern artists are\nin fact talentless criminals with a license\nto print/paint money because they\u2019re\nable to tell some quite exotic lies about\nwhat their pieces mean. In short, I was\nperhaps a little harsh...\nI know my previous statement may\nhave rubbed some people up the wrong\nway, but I often find myself in front\nsome sort of bin bag chainsaw motif and\nwonder, why? Why is this considered\nart? How can someone spend hundreds\nof thousands of pounds on something\nthat appears to be the result of a drunken\nelephant attacking the artist\u2019s bins? Am\nI the only one who thinks this? I suspect\nnot.\nThe fact is that it\u2019s easy to get held up\non the work of a few high profile artists\nwhose \u2018creations\u2019 hit the media due to\ntheir controversial nature. They should\nnot be allowed to affect our judgement\non the rest of the genre, as I found out\nin quite a magnificent fashion on my trip\nthis weekend to the Frieze Arts Fair.\nThe Frieze Arts Fair is an annual event\ncomprised of some 150 plus specially\nselected contemporary art galleries from\naround the world, all descending on Regents Park to exhibit work and celebrate\nmodern contemporary art. Each gallery\nis given a small section of a giant temporary structure in which to exhibit some\nof their choice artist\u2019s best work. The\nmain aim here is to use vivid displays to\npromote the gallery and create networking opportunities with the incontinently\nrich (of which there appeared to be no\nshortage). I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever\nseen over 150 galleries all trying to outdo each other in one enclosed area, but\nthe result is quite spectacular.\nMy entrance to the fair was overlooked\nby the wax-work of a slightly worried\nlooking small child on a 10ft diving\nboard, next to which sat a giant mirror\nwhich regularly tremored and rippled\nviolently on the wall, causing one immediately to feel slightly queasy. I backed\naway and decided to take a bit of a look\naround at anything that wasn\u2019t the mir-ror. Each gaze swept over a mix of vibrant colours, weird experimentations,\nintricate and methodical design and\nliterally anything else you could think\nof, between which milled hundreds of\npeople from all walks of life. The obvious scruffy or plain unusual looking art-ists, immaculately suited businessmen\nand equally well dressed women. One\nwoman appeared to be wearing nothing\nat all except a heavy layer of paint and\ntattoos with a pair of practically nonexistent spandex hot-pants, all the while\nbeing followed round by a tall spaced\nout looking man wielding a small video\ncamera, while she appeared to flirt with\nthe exhibits...\nYes it was strange, but God it was\nexciting! Pieces that I might not have\nlooked at twice in any other setting suddenly took on new meaning in the buzzing atmosphere which permeated the entire building, each work giving its own\nspecial something to the surroundings.\nOf course there were still some things\nthat I struggled with: some childishly\ndrawn figures in black marker pen on\npieces of paper smaller than A4, a skeleton painted black, what appeared to be\na charred pile of industrial waste... You\nget the picture.\nThe important thing was that there\nwere some great surprises. A large work\nby Tomory Dodge was simply comprised of a number of thick lines of\nbright paint on a dark background, the\nnet effect being a futuristic, almost luminous vision. Another fantastic achievement was by Tomas Saraceno with his\nhanging sculpture entitled \u2018Hydrogen\nCloud Explosion\u2019, which managed to\nbring what could be considered some\ndull geometry to life by filling it with an\nexplosion of black elastic.\nWhen I eventually left the Frieze it\nwas with high spirits. I had expected to\nleave with irritation before my arrival\nand yet instead I left with hope. Real art\nis not dead. There are some massively\ntalented and wonderfully quirky people\nout there who probably spend their lives\nin a world that I was privileged enough\nto experience for a few short hours. I\nhope the contemporary art scene continues its twisting and turning progression\nuntil next year. I will definitely be back.\nThis year, the\nFrieze Fair\nhad more than\n60,000 visitors\nin five days \u2013\nCheck it out\nnext year from\n13-16 October\nPart of Tomory Dodge\u2019s \u2018Drop\u2019, which was amongst the hundreds of pieces exhibited at the commercial art event of the year\nChris Clarke\n\n"

I\u2019m gesturing at my\nmidriff here, you can\u2019t see\nfrom where you\u2019re sitting,\nobviously. No, I work hard to maintain\nmy physique, a bristling thirteen stone\nof organic matter. Here\u2019s my routine for\nyou \u2013 seven a.m., wake up. Eight a.m.,\nwake up again. Sometimes I wake up\nagain at nine just for the sheer hell of it,\nand also because I forget to set my alarm\non Sunday evenings.\nBam. Where are you? Still gazing longingly at the impression of my\nsculpted physique on the bed? Too slow.\nI\u2019m in the shower. Bit of shampoo.\nBit of body wash. Then a little bit of\nmanly screaming as I realise I\u2019ve used\nthe shower gel made with \u2018over seven\nthousand real mint leaves\u2019 and my body\nis collapsing in menthol-fresh agony.\nRinse. More body wash, this time with\nsoothing lavender.\nBoom. What\u2019s that? You\u2019re still rendered speechless by the sight of my unbelievably well-constructed neck mus-cles? I\u2019m sorry, but if you\u2019re looking for\nme I\u2019ll be in the front room doing bench\nAngry Geek\npresses while drinking my muesli-based\nprotein shake through a str-Alright no, I don\u2019t do that. The truth\nis I\u2019m a little bit overweight, and my\nmorning routine consists of stomping\naround my flat clawing at the pre-emp-tive ghosts of all the television show\nhosts I intend on killing and trying to\nmake tea out of porridge oats. That\u2019s me.\nI know I could do a lot better than my\nwibbly torso, and as a student I should\nbe using my Wednesday afternoons to\nenrich my life by taking part in all manner of sporting activity, but in reality, I\neither have too much work or just can\u2019t\nbe bothered. And when the best on offer\nis the prospect of chasing a small ball\naround a cuboid room with a bunch of\nother \u201cblokes\u201d while sweating profuse-ly, well, I suppose I\u2019m just a traditional-ist. Where the tradition is dying young\nand leaving a bloated corpse.\nEveryone knows that health is no\nlaughing matter, but at our age it\u2019s not\nthe only priority either. Yes, we\u2019re all\nof an age where great damage could be\ndone to our bodies, and equally an age\nwhere good habits could be set up for\nlife. But we\u2019re also at an age where we\nhave the best opportunities to excel aca-demically, or play copious amounts of\nblock-based videogames, or spend long\nmornings thinking up witty comebacks\nto a tutorial helper\u2019s smarmy comments\nabout your coursework.\nFrankly, it\u2019s pretty weird looking up to\nthe first floor of the Ethos gym to see a\ndozen over-hormoned medical students\nbearing down on you at a relative velocity of zero, while they secretly listen to\nKorn and the Backstreet Boys on their\niPods. That pedestal they\u2019re on, looking down on you as you trudge towards\nExhibition Road at chuckles o\u2019clock\nin the morning, stuffing your face with\nwhichever chocolate bar was whispering most alluringly at you in the shop,\nisn\u2019t healthy for anyone.\nMy advice? Sod the lot of it. The\nevenings are getting darker and you\u2019re\nreaching that fleshy middle bit of the\nterm where all the coursework collects.\nCan\u2019t manage to make it to some engagement or other this week? Write it\noff. Go buy a Wispa bar.\nYou might die five years before everyone else, but you\u2019ll have saved yourself\nsixty years of worry in the meantime.\nA\ns I dodge knife-wielding\npigeons and Underground commuters, disgruntled by the sheer\nvirtue of being awake,\non my way in to college from the outer\nfringes of the capital (and civilisation),\nI remember with fondness my first year\nhere, spent in the sheltered haven of\nPrince\u2019s Gardens.\nIt was the one time in my life that I\ncould afford, although only just, to revel\nin an SW7 postcode and the prestige that\ncame with it. It was Hyde Park adjacent,\nshould I ever require the pastoral support\nof the ducks. Never underestimate the\nwisdom that comes with webbed feet.\nAnd I could fall out of bed and into my\nlecture theatre. But what I really loved\nwas that if I fell out of the wrong side of\nthe bed, I would land in a museum!\nBy all rights, Exhibition Road should\ncollapse in on itself under the weight of\nits cultural gravitas. The Royal Albert\nHall, the Science Museum, The Victoria\nand Albert Museum and that cathedral\nof knowledge itself, the Natural History Museum. Just thinking about them\nis enough to get me salivating. Yes, it\nmeans that South Kensington station is\nalways crowded and it would be easier\nto wade through treacle to get to col-Rhys Davies\nlege during half terms but we are incredibly lucky to be situated where we\nare. The air is positively suffused with\nknowledge. But as much as I love these\nhalls of science, history, and culture, my\nheart truly belongs to Holborn and the\nmajesty of the British Museum. It is a\nprince among museums in its own right,\nbut what I find even better is its remit.\nIt is a cornerstone of the archetypal\nholiday abroad. You trawl the markets\nfor some kind of trinket to take home for\nthe relatives. The vast majority of said\ntrinkets will consist of tea-towels with a\nmap of the locale printed on them, snow\nglobes in the Costa del Sol and plaster of\nParis stereotypes of local life.\nThis formula has been around, in one\nform of another, for hundreds of years.\nFor young toffs on their \u201cGap Yah\u201d in\nthe eighteenth century, these holidays\nlasted for months and involved a grand\ntour of the whole of Europe. And the curios that they picked up were more than\nname plates spelt out in seashells. The\nElgin Marbles, the Rosetta Stone and a\nprincely court of mummified pharoahs\nto give just a few examples. I\u2019d hate to\nthink of the postage costs.\nThe British Museum was specifically\nbuilt to showcase the wonders and artefacts that its patrons stumbled upon the\nworld over. In other words, it is a trophy\nroom for all the things we\u2019ve stolen over\nthe years. And we\u2019re proud of it! It is\none of London\u2019s top attractions \u2013 a stiff-upper-lip monument to theft.\nWhat I really love is that it allows us\nto see history with a double-vision, of\nsorts. Obviously, these relics allow us a\nglimpse into antiquity but also, because\nthey are here, in London, where they\nhave no right to be, they allow us to see\npart of our own history. A slice of our\ncountry\u2019s past when we weren\u2019t quite\nthe quiet middle-management drone we\ntry to be today. A time when we craved\nnew and exciting things and didn\u2019t\nworry too much about how we acquired\nthem. We didn\u2019t just experiment with\ndrugs (though gin and opium seemed to\nstick), we experimented with cultures\nwholesale. And the trend-setter for all\nthis was the British Museum itself.\nWhile very little in the museum is\nnative to this isle, it will always be the\nBritish Museum, as only we could steal\nso much stuff and get away with it. Today, in these august years, it is like a tat-too, a reminder of our naughty past. And\nlike a tattoo, it will be with us for a long\ntime to come yet.\n(Disclaimer: I do not condone stealing\nof any kind, especially where national\ntreasures are involved. Unless you can\nget away with it.)\nIn praise of cultural theft\n\u201cThe British Museum\nis one of London\u2019s\ntop attractions \u2013\na stiff-upper-lip\nmonument to theft.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019m just a\ntraditionalist. Where\nthe tradition is dying\nyoung and leaving a\nbloated corpse.\u201d\nNo Pain, No Gain\nThe NHS and universities are\nconsumers of the scarcest resource in the UK today. Government money. Looking at\nthese two consumers shows\nhow the government could be\ndoing things differently in the\nSpending Review. Chancellor\nGeorge Osborne\u2019s cuts are a\nnecessary step to eliminate\nthe staggering structural\ndeficit left by Gordon Brown,\nTony Blair and their blank\ncheque book.\nI feel that protecting the\nNHS is a mistake. It was a\nTory election pledge that\nthere would be no real terms\ncut in the NHS budget, a cue\nfor their poll ratings to in-crease. However, Mr Osborne\nshould have made savings in\nthe NHS\u2019s \u00a3122bn budget.\nAccording to the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, efficiency savings\nof \u00a35bn are possible if there\nwere to be a reduction in the\nvariation of clinical practice.\n\u00a35bn is 5 times more than\nthe savings the Chancellor\nwill make with the child benefit cuts.\nWhile protecting the NHS is\na vote winner, the potential\nrise in tuition fees is certainly not, and could be the coalition breaker. So who would\nfill the funding hole, if student fees were to remain un-changed? I think the private\nsector should invest in university funding. Take, for exam-ple, the banking sector; they\nnab the brightest graduates\nand make them work ridiculous hours in order to make\nprofits of billions. What if a\nproportion of those billions\nwere invested back into uni-versities? Graduates will continue to move into the private\nsector and, to be frank, the\nprivate sector needs them. It\nseems reasonable to ask the\nprivate sector to invest in the\nUniversities that provide the\ngraduates that they want.\nI\u2019ve only talked about the\nNHS and Universities funding\nbut there is a lot more that\ncould be done to improve the\nspending review. Whether or\nnot people agree with the\nway the coalition is going\nabout its business, the clich\u00e9\n\u2018no pain, no gain\u2019 seems most\nappropriate in these testing\ntimes.\nSamir Patel\nMy body is a temple... to laziness\n\n"

Pio Monti was not on form losing narrowly to a\nvery good player and Rob Bush lost in 3\nsets in a very entertaining match. Adam\nGunasekara however produced a sole\nvictory despite losing the second set 6-0\nwhich he claims to have been a superb\ntactical move allowing him to rest up for\nthe 3rd.

Imperial\nwas looking to get off to a good start,\nafter the championship season of 2009.\nFielding a 17 man squad, consisting of\nreturning team members and first year\nplayers, the team bus left the Union on\nroute to the Roundshaw baseball pitch\nat Croydon, arriving well ahead of the\nnoon start time. The Falcons and the\nLions were tied at one early in the first\ngame but a six run explosion in the 3rd\ninning provided the run support for a 7-1\nImperial win. Vassil Botev and Hajime\nUrata combined to pitch a two hit, 12\nstrikeout gem.\nThe Falcons were feeling good about\nits chances for a sweep, with ace Hanson Cheung taking the mound for game\ntwo. Indeed, Imperial quickly took a 5-2\nlead and looked to be in a dominant po-sition. However, the Lions mounted a\nspirited fightback and tied the game at\nfive going into the final inning, but a key\ndouble play by Arun Krishnan and Gary\nLam and a well-fielded bunt by Hanson\non the mound stopped Kings taking the\nlead.

Excluding\nfinancial interventions, which\nare considered to be both necessary and hold long term sustainability as they should produce a return, National debt\nhas risen by 8.2%, from 49%\nof GDP a year ago.\nLabour has argued that Osborne is being too brutal with\nthe metaphorical axe and risks\na double-dip recession; on the\ncontrary, careful consideration\nof the figures coupled with\nmeetings with British industry\nfigures shows Osborne is doing just enough to maintain\nBritain\u2019s AAA credit rating while\nnot shocking the economy into\na double-dip. The budgets over\nthis parliamentary term may\nreduce the annual deficit, but\nthey do not intend to generate\na surplus or break even. National debt as a proportion of\nGDP is projected to rise to well\ninto 70s and not be reduced\nuntil 2014/15 at the earliest.\nThe government\u2019s approach,\nfrom a macroeconomic perspective at least, has been to\nconsider carefully the best balance to avoid recession.\nRajat Jain\ntributed to Business Secretary Vince Cable and Science Minister David Willetts\nand their negotiation with the Treasury\nearlier in the week, but other significant\nevents that may have influenced the final\ndecision include significant protest from\nthe Science is Vital group, with their petition of over 36,000 signatories and rally at Westminster earlier in the month.\nThe Times also published a special plea\non Monday to limit cuts to below 10%.\nThe latest announcements have\nbeen met with tentative positiv-ity across the scientific spectrum.\nThe Royal Society, a fellowship of\neminent and prominent scientists, previously stated that a cut of 10% would\n\u201cseriously jeopardise\u201d the UKs scientific capabilities. Martin Rees, President\nof the Royal Society is however pleased\nwith the \u201cwelcome news\u201d and praises\nthe outcome, stating to the BBC that\nthe, \u201cgovernment has recognised the importance of sustaining the international\nstanding of UK science in a context\nwhere other nations are forging ahead.\u201d\nCampaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE), a pressure group devoted\nto aiding scientific growth in the UK,\nhas highlighted some possible future\nproblems for the sector in response\nto the cuts. It suggests that the number of research staff entering science\nand engineering will decrease, with\nthe potential of postgraduate positions\nfalling by a tenth. Though Director\nof CaSE, Imran Khan, is encouraged\nthat the cuts are not deeper, he also\nbelieves the UK\u2019s standing in terms\nof scientific output will be threatened.\nUniversities UK (UUK), representative organisation for the country\u2019s\nhigher education institutions, echoes\nthe sentiments of the other groups.\nProfessor Steve Smith, President of\nUUK says, \u201cWe are pleased that the\nGovernment has listened to Universities UK\u2019s views on the importance of\nscience and research to the growth of\nthe economy...However the freezing\nof funding for research will still pose\nchallenges to our universities.\u201d Professor Smith goes on to list two priorities\nfor the sector that he believes are crucial to future success: firstly, ensuring\nthat \u201cthe cuts do not impact negatively\non current and future students\u201d and\nsecondly \u201cto find alternative funding\nsources to replace these lost funds.\u201d\nThe budget is set to be distributed\namong the UK\u2019s research councils,\nwho will provide grants to both individuals and universities based on their\nacademic strength. Because of this, it\nis thought that some of the country\u2019s\nelite universities will take a greater\nproportion of the money, threatening\nuniversities less focused on research.\nHowever, the news of no deeper\ncuts will likely appease those scientists who were troubled by the initial\nprojected figures, after it was recently\nreported that some individuals are\nconsidering a move to better funded\ncourses and research positions overseas.\nTime will no doubt tell how satisfied\nscientists become as the cuts become\nfully implemented across the country.\nSo what will the impact be on Imperial? The 2010 NSS (National Student\nSurvey) results point towards already excellent teaching at Imperial with an outstanding result of 90% for satisfaction\nwith learning resources. With a poorer\nresult obtained in satisfaction with assessment and feedback, the Rector has\nmade these issues an immediate priority in the university. Implemented this\nyear, the Biology department now has a\ntwo week deadline for coursework feed-back. This is just one example of many\nhighlighting Imperial\u2019s commitment to\ncontinuous improvement in teaching.\nAdditionally, the Browne review stated that any universities charging over\n\u00a37,000 a year will be \u2018subject to scru-tiny, ensuring that these extra funds are\nbeing used fairly\u2019. Despite the tuition\nfee cap being lifted, the government emphasises that regulations are still firmly\nin place. We should rest assured that\nImperial is being kept a close eye on.\nWith the government\u2019s pledge to\nmaintain funding for \u2018STEM\u2019 subjects\n\u2013 science, technology, engineering and\nmathematics, Imperial\u2019s teaching budget may not be so harshly wiped. The\nsurprising freeze on science research\nfunding and likely high allocation of\nresources to research-intensive universities should also sit nicely with Imperial.\nSo future Imperial students can expect to see fees doubled, tripled, maybe\neven quadrupled, but it seems that the\nteaching and research are set to stay\nmuch the same high quality as ever.\nNumbers\nThere will be a 40% cut\nto the teaching budget\nThe UK spends 1.7%\nof GDP on research.\nAmerica spends 2.8%\nThere will be a 10%\ncut to government\nresearch funding\nGraphics by Veronica McQuadeova\nThe need for cuts\nAdditional Reporting:\nElizabeth Crouch\nEditorial: Page 18\nPhoto by Miles Robertson\n\n"

It\u2019s the Titanic!\u201d\nFELIX\nFriday 22 October 2010\n12\nA new study led by researchers at Imperial College\nand the University of Colorado indicates that the\nSun may act contrary to what was previously be-lieved, producing a warming effect on the earth as\nits activity declines, and vice versa. If the results\nof the study are correct, what we know about the\nSun\u2019s contribution to global warming will have to be\nradically revised.\nThe Sun\u2019s activity waxes and wanes over cycles\nof 11 years, and it has previously been thought that\nthe solar warming effect was proportional to the ac-tivity. This activity is gauged by the number of Sun\nspots and their size. The determining factor of the\nmagnitude of solar warming however is the spectral\ncomposition of the solar irradiance.\nThe study, led by Professor Joanna Haigh, head\nof the Department of Physics and a member of the\nGrantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial\nCollege, found that in the most recent period of de-cline, radiation in the UV spectrum decreased more\nthan expected, which was compensated in part by\nan increase in radiation in the visible spectrum. Results were taken by the Spectral Irradiance Monitor\ninstrument on the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment satellite between 2004 and 2007. UV light\nis responsible for heating the middle atmosphere;\nthe radiation disassociates atmospheric molecules,\ninitiating a chain of chemical reactions which ultimately create stratospheric ozone. Light radiated at\nthe lower end the spectrum has a more directly penetrating effect: visible and near infra-red light warm\nthe lower atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface. The\noverall effect during the most recent period of decline was to produce an increase in heating. It is\nthought that the converse phenomena would occur\nwhen the Sun\u2019s activity increases.\nGiven that the Sun\u2019s activity has been increasing\nover the past 100 years, the results of the study\nwill be leaving climate scientists hot under the col-lar. It had hitherto been assumed that the Sun had\nbeen increasing the temperature of the earth, but\nthe new research indicates that the Sun\u2019s role may\nhave been overstated. It is critical that further research is undertaken before any assertions can be\nmade, however. Professor Joanna Haigh comments\nthat, \u201c\u201cWe cannot jump to any conclusions based on\nwhat we have found during this comparatively short\nperiod and we need to carry out further studies to\nexplore the Sun\u2019s activity, and the patterns that we\nhave uncovered, on longer timescales. However, if\nfurther studies find the same pattern over a longer\nperiod of time, this could suggest that we may have\noverestimated the Sun\u2019s role in warming the planet,\nrather than underestimating it.\u201d\nMelissa Lever\nPolly Bennett\n\u2018Radical change\u2019 needed to\nfight CO2 emissions\nIn Brief\nSun activity decline may counter-intuitively cause warming\nA briefing paper released last week by the\nGrantham Institute for Climate Change has\nwarned the government, industry and public\nthat \u201cradical changes\u201d to the transport industry are vital in order to effectively reduce CO2\nemissions. The authors, all of Imperial College\nresearch teams, reviewed current low carbon\ntechnologies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions from road transport vehicles\nand their fuels. The conclusion reached is that\nalterations to improve energy efficiency in existing vehicles will not be sufficient to cause a\nsignificant reduction in emissions and a switch\nto hybrid or fully electric cars, coupled with\ndecarbonisation of the electricity grid through\nincreased use of alternative fuels, will be nec-essary.\nIn 2008 the then elected new energy and\nclimate change secretary, David Milliband,\npledged the UK would reduce GHG emissions\nby 80% from 1990 levels by 2050, replacing the previous target of 60%. This included\ntackling the contribution of GHG emissions\nmade by UK road transport. In 2007, transport\ncontributed 23% of the GHG emissions from\nenergy-related industries. Lead author of the\nbriefing paper Dr David Howey states \u201cthe UK\nhas one of the poorer emission track records\nin Europe\u201d and highlights in the report that\nonly through consistent political aid and policy\nchanges involving automotive and power industry companies will this target be achievable.\nDespite the inability to reduce emissions\nsignificantly the authors suggest changes to\nexisting vehicles will go some way to mitigating climate change while the emerging\ntechnologies of alternative fuels and low\ncarbon vehicles become more viable. Suggestions for effective improvements include\nvehicle weight reduction to improve energy\nefficiency in stop-start urban driving, engine\ndownsizing, and kinetic energy recovery sys-tems. The authors raise concerns however that\nimproving vehicle efficiency will lower maintenance and running costs which may have\nthe rebound effect of increasing road traffic,\nthereby reducing any benefits gained from\nsuch changes.\nThe authors also state unequivocally that a\nswitch from fossil to alternative fuels, such as\nelectricity and biofuels is crucial, and supports\ntheir message that there needs to be \u201ca change\nin behaviour as well as technology.\u201d Just over\n90% of UK car trips are less than 25 miles\nwhich, according to the report, is encouragement for the implementation of electric cars\ndespite barriers to this technology. However\nthe report identifies range limitation, battery\ncost and reliance on a decarbonised grid as issues hindering the development of electric and\nplug-in hybrid electric vehicles. In addition,\nthe report identifies long haul truck and aviation as the most likely beneficiaries of biofuels\nbut also highlights that competition for land\nwith food production and issues with energy\nefficiency are currently delaying the progression of these technologies.\nLast week also saw the launch of the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research Network by\nImperial\u2019s Future Labs to coincide with the\nrelease of the briefing paper. Dr Ricardo Martinez-Botas co-author of the briefing paper\nand leader of the network explains that \u201cthe\nmove to low carbon vehicles needs to embrace the significant and affordable changes\nthat engineering can make. This new network\nbrings together work from different departments within Imperial, making them aware\nof the different research efforts in hybrid\nand electric vehicles and with the aim to lead\nthe world in setting the agenda for low carbon technology in the coming decades.\u201d The\nlaunch event itself he reported \u201chad a high\nlevel of attendance with contributions from\nleaders in the field including Miguel Fragoso\nfrom GM UK who outlined the future power\ntrain configuration to achieve low carbon impact vehicles.\u201d\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: James Goldsack\nKatya-yani Vyas\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

As\nMusic Editor I\u2019ve made it my duty to find the\nbrightest young musicians at Imperial and extract juicy musical knowledge from their souls.\nWho better to start with then but Martin\nArcher, an Imperial Physics graduate who\nhas been DJing for Kiss Radio for the past few\nyears and is now returning to us for a PhD on\nthe size, shape and motion of structures in the\nmagnetosphere. He\u2019s a pretty busy guy, but we\nmet up a week before he started his PhD and\nMartin had a lot to say about student and national radio, spreading the physics love, and\nnew musical interface technologies.\nHow long\u2019s it been since you graduated and\nwhy come back to Imperial?\n4 years. Graduated in 2006, and round about\nthis time a year ago a friend put the idea of doing a PhD in my head. I didn\u2019t want to give up\nmy job at Kiss, it\u2019s a cool job. You\u2019d be a fool\nto get rid of that, so many people would love to\ndo what I do. I didn\u2019t think it would be possible\nto do a PhD. I was in the pub with my mate and\nhe said you could do a PhD part time which\ndoesn\u2019t cross a lot of people\u2019s minds. I\u2019ve been\na bit of an administrative pain to a lot of people\nat Imperial. I approached someone in the Physics department that I\u2019d done some research\nwith over the Summer. It just set the ball rolling\na year ago, and I start next week.\nHow did you get into DJing?\nI\u2019d done DJing before I was even at Imperial.\nI\u2019d been on local radio for a couple of years,\nand then IC Radio is a great place to get involved with. By the final year of my under-grad, I was spending pretty much equal time on\nIC Radio and on my degree. I was doing like 5\nshows a week, and I was head of programming\nfor a bit, head of music for a bit, went all out\nwith that. It was so much fun.\nAt the end of my degree, I did a bit of work\nexperience round and about, a fair bit of net-working, meeting people generally at events\nwith free wine, so people knew me and it payed\noff. I got a job at a production company who relaunched HMV\u2019s instore radio, rolling it out in\nall 220 stores using a new software that hadn\u2019t\nbeen used before over here but is really big in\nAmerica. They knew that I\u2019d be able to get my\nhands round any sort of new software, as an\nImperial Physics graduate.\nWithin nine months it was all running\nsmoothly. And I was sort of doing some work\non a really small radio station, just outside of\nLondon, in the south west, based in Tollworth,\nthat played some quite bad music to be hon-est. I\u2019d never come across Kajagoogoo before\nI worked there \u2013 \u201cToo Shy Shy\u201d, really cheesy\nsort of late 70s-80s record.\nIt just kept the creative juices flowing a bit,\nkept me in the radio, presenting. Then one day\nI sent a demo over to Kiss, and two weeks later\nI got a job. So I was extremely lucky, extremely\nwell timed, and hopefully I can say I was kind\nof good. They must have thought I was alright,\nand I\u2019ve been there for three and a half years\nnow \u2013 they haven\u2019t sacked me yet.\nI\u2019d imagine most radio presenters and DJs\nwould leave a station after a couple of years.\nIt all depends on what radio station you\u2019re\nat, Kiss is quite good in that they\u2019ll only get\nrid of you if they have a really good reason.\nIt\u2019s not like Capitol, since I\u2019ve been on air for\nKiss they\u2019ve had at least two complete lineup changes, maybe three. Kiss only had the\none since I\u2019ve joined, and that was when I got\npromoted. I used to be on in the middle of the\nnight, which was playing havoc on my body\nclock, I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t do that anymore.\nBut you gotta start somewhere. It\u2019s been really\ngood times.\nI suppose it\u2019s quite a change from IC Radio\nwith regards to the number of listeners...\nThere were many times at IC Radio when I\nwas convinced no one was listening, not even\nmy mates could be bothered. There might have\nbeen the odd person but at least on Kiss you\u2019re\nguaranteed there\u2019s at least one person there lis-tening, even in the middle of the night. When\nyou\u2019re on in the evenings, you know that there\nare people listening because so many people\nsend in texts, or messages through Facebook.\nFacebook is the new platform for interacting\nwith radio stations, or any sort of brands really\nnow. Everyone really gets facebook, especially\nyoung people, so there\u2019s so many people on\nthat. You can directly interact with listeners,\nand that\u2019s what I love doing the most. Having\na bit of a laugh, taking the piss out of people a\nlittle bit. It\u2019s a bit of fun and adds a good vibe\nto the show, I just love that.\nDo you have any tips for anybody who would\nlike to get into DJing?\nKeep at it. Listen to yourself all the time, critique yourself. Network, send your stuff out and\ntry and get feedback. It\u2019s a tough time maybe\nat the moment, a lot fewer jobs right now than\nthere used to be, like 5 years ago. There are a\nlot fewer radio stations to be honest. Student\nradio and community radio are really where\nthey\u2019ll be taking the new talent from for years\nto come, so just do as much as you can really.\nBut not to the detriment of your degree, you\nmight need that to fall back on. If you can manage 50-50, probably a bit more on your degree,\nbut don\u2019t let your degree slide.\nWhat next for you then?\nI\u2019ve got a podcast that I do with a mate of\nmine, who was on the Science Media Production course at Imperial. We got together one\nevening and thought: \u201cYou know, there aren\u2019t\nany podcasts that really tackle science from a\nyounger angle.\u201d Everyone seems to follow the\nformat of Radio 4, who are very good at doing what they do, but don\u2019t necessarily need\nGregory Power\nImperial\u2019s own DJ\nPhysics returns\nNot just a voice for radio: he\u2019s got the looks, skills, and a Physics degree.

A further\nthree goals in quick succession \u2013 all stolen by\nShanika, in a similar vein to the first \u2013 sealed\nour early advantage, leaving the half-time score\nat Imperial College 4 \u2013 Kings College 0.\nThe second half continued in true Ladies 1s\nstyle, generously allowing Kings one breakaway goal, but ensuring the victory by netting\nanother four ourselves!\nIncredibly solid defending from a back line,\nhalf of whom were freshers, meant spending\nmuch of our time in the Kings half, and conceding not one penalty corner! Despite blinding sunshine towards the end, Teddy\u2019s terrifying swings left the opposition defence stunned\nfor two of the goals, and freshers Harriet and\nKirstin finished off two more \u2013 a great lifted\nshot off the rebound from Kirstin flying past\nthe helpless Kings keeper.\nOur own keeper, Gemma, also pulled off\nsome cracking saves on the few occasions\nKings were allowed through, and we\u2019d like to\nthank her for stepping in to fill a goalie-shaped\nhole in our team.\nIf any ladies fancy goal keeping for either\nof the ICHC Ladies\u2019 teams - we\u2019re pretty\ndesperate, can you tell? - please contact us at\nic.hockey@imperial.ac.uk.\nAn 8-1 final score gave the ladies a pretty\nsuccessful start to the season \u2013 one they hope\nto continue on Wednesday against the ladies at\nSt Mary\u2019s.\nIce Hockey\nThe sports\nthat Imperial\nforgot\nOver the next few weeks, FelixSport\nwill go over some of the lesser know\nsports team at Imperial. This week,\nHugh McDowell takes a look at Ice\nHockey\nIce hockey is an incredibly face-paced intense game.\nIt is played with 6 players on the ice- 3 forwards (cen-tre and two wingers) 2 defense and a goalie. A team\nis generally made up of three \u2018lines\u2019- forward and defense sets and a goalie. The game has three 20 minute\nstop-clock periods, so there is no hanging around waiting for time-wasters and several goals can be scored\nin the space of a few seconds. Unlike many other\nsports, substitutions or \u2018changes\u2019 are unlimited and\nhappen on- the-fly. Generally, a complete forward or\ndefense line change to maintain unity but if a skater\nhas knackered themselves out, they can come to the\nbench where a replacement seamlessly hops over the\nboards to join the action. It is expected that you skate\nas hard as possible for the length of your shift and so\nin the NHL the average shift is only around 45 seconds\nbecause of this.\nHockey is a full contact sport and players are permitted to take-out the puck carrier, known as \u2018checking\u2019,\nbut only by certain means- use of the stick for tripping,\nhooking or checking from behind will result in a penalty.\nStandard penalties last for two minutes where the offending player is in the \u2018penalty box\u2019 and the team continue to play with one less player- on the \u2018penalty kill\u2019.\nThe opposing team are on the \u2018power play\u2019, which is\nthe best opportunity to score, which ends the penalty if\nthey do so. If the penalised team score a \u2018short- handed\u2019 goal then penalty still has to be served out- hence\nteams usually play very defensively when down a play-er. The team with the most goals at the end of the 60\nminutes wins; and with the stop-clock and end-to-end\naction, last minute comebacks are a regular feature.\nTim Runcorn\nWhat is Ice Hockey?\nIce Hockey at Imperial?\nWhere do I sign up?\n\u201cIf I can do it, anyone can,\u201d says a modest Tim\nRuncorn, president of the Imperial Devils Ice\nHockey team. \u201cIn fact, aside from it being an\nawesome sport in general, the fact that you can\nsee yourself progress so quickly is a major reason why I love the sport.\u201d\nThe Imperial Devils are one of a number of\nsports clubs on campus looking to recruit beginner players to bolster their playing staff.\nTheir president is keen to dispel the myth that\nIce Hockey is too difficult to take up.\n\u201cAnother misconception that a lot of people\nhave is they need previous experience to join\nthe club,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a complete beginner\n- literally could barely skate - two years ago\nand now I\u2019ll be playing for the A-Team this\nseason.\u201d\nFounded in 2000 by roller-hockey players,\nthe club\u2019s early years were fraught with administrative difficulties. The departure of a succession of presidents from Imperial made any sort\nof continuity impossible. Now, however, the\nDevils have an accredited coach (former Devils player David Coolegem) and two teams,\nboth of which train regularly at Streatham Ice\nRink in South London.\n\u201cWe have two teams, an A-Team for players\nwith previous experience and those who move\nup from the B-Team which is for complete\nbeginners,\u201d says the club president. \u201cBoth\nteams play in the BUIHA leagues in Div 2\nand Div 3 respectively. The league games are\nagainst other universities in the south such as\nOxford, London, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff,\nWarwick, and Southampton.\u201d\nGiven that Ice Hockey is a relatively expensive sport, the Devils are grateful for the support of the Union, the Harlington Trust and the\nIC Trust.\n\u201cThe size of the grant enables us to have the\ncheapest ice hockey sessions in London and\nthe club kits enable beginners to get into the\nsport without having to spend megabucks. This\nis why I urge people to give ice hockey a go\nat university- there is no way that people can\nget into the sport so easily or cheaply anywhere\nelse.\u201d\nBoth the A and B teams contain a mix of\nmales and females, and the B team play a less\nphysical \u2018non-checking\u2019league. The two teams\nplay in BUIHA leagues in Division 2 and Division 3 respectively.\nThe Devils also boast an active social calen-dar, with pub golf, club nights and a Christmas\ndinner planned. The Ice Hockey season culminates with the Nationals, where, in the words\nof Tim Runcorn, \u201cevery team from the UK descends on Sheffield for a weekend of intense\nice hockey competition and a massive piss-up.\u201d\nThe Imperial Devils play in Streatham Ice\nRink on Sunday nights, and matches are free\nto attend.\nHugh McDowell\nThe Imperial Devils.

After I started looking at walking New\nZealand I found that there was a track that went\nthe whole way, the Te Araroa trail.\u201d\nWith just less than a month to go, preparations for the trek have been underway. Already\nLandey and Anders have set up a website,\nTastyTrek.com, which details the route, research resources and equipment lists. It also\nfeatures a rather slick tracking system: an interactive map that will show their current location\nand display relevant blog posts.\nBut how prepared are they?\nAnders has adopted a confident attitude and\nminimal planning. Landey, however, has mixed\nfeelings.\n\u201cExcited, confident and a little nervous; not\nnecessarily about getting lost or anything, as\nwe are giving ourselves leeway to take it slow\nat the beginning and time to chill if we need\nto. I\u2019m a little nervous that walking everyday\nwill get dull or monotonous but provided one\nof us doesn\u2019t break a leg or get savagely sick or\nsomething well definitely do it.\u201d\nThe landscape in New Zealand may be majestic but the challenges the terrain poses simply\ncannot be underestimated. Having previously\ntravelled in New Zealand, is there a particular\nsection of the trek Anders is dreading of walking through?\n\u201cI\u2019m slightly fearing Ninety Mile Beach \u2013\nit is the first track, a three-day walk along the\nsame stretch of beach. We will probably still be\ngetting used to the packs, our bodies\u2019 capabilities and the routine of living on the trail. Also\nwalking on sand is a bitch and there\u2019s relatively\nlittle water.\u201d\n\u201cAlso I expect some difficult sections in the\nSouth Island with the added complication of\ntonnes of rain, but by that time we\u2019ll be ready\nfor anything,\u201d Landey added.\nAnywhere looked forward to?\n\u201cI really want to climb Mount Cook even\nTravel Blog of the Week\nCape Reinga by Alexander Ford\nWant to see your travel photograph featured here?\nSend it to travel.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nN\new Zealand. For a land-of-the-long-white-cloud the size of\nUnited Kingdom, which secludes itself in the south-eastern\ncorner of the world map, and\nhouses a population of sheep outnumbering\nthat of humans by 15:1, it boasts an uncanny\namount of eccentrics and their heroic \u2013 yet insane \u2013 antics.\nEdmund Hilary, whose ascent would later\nearn him a knighthood, honed his mountaineering skills in the Southern Alps of New Zealand\u2019s South Island. A J Hackett, better known\nas the \u2018father of bungy jumping\u2019, performed his\nfirst jump from Greenhithe Bridge, Auckland,\nand commercialised his \u2018insanity\u2019 on Kawarau\nBridge, Queenstown. Meanwhile, James Livingston and his mates sailed a pub and gallons\nof Speights \u2013 brand of a New Zealand beer with\nproud heritage \u2013 from Dunedin to London to\nquench the thirst of their homesick compatriots.\nEven having lived amongst the extraordi-naires, with their ambitious yet seemingly ludicrous (depending on perspective, clearly)\nschemes still strikes me with much fascination.\nSo when two Imperial graduates approached\nme with their grand plan I could only admire\nand utter an obligatory \u201csweet as\u201d.\nAlexander \u2018Anders\u2019 Ford and Landey Patton,\nthough it\u2019s not on the trail but it\u2019s worth the day\nwalk each way. There will definitely be a load\nof places that we will want to go once we hear\nabout them; we aren\u2019t planning which hotspots\nto visit as we are fairly impulsive and would\nrather take a locals\u2019 word over a travel guide.\u201d\nWith hundreds casting away their student\nstatus and exiting the Royal Albert Hall on\nWednesday to commence a new chapter of their\nlives, there will be no shortages of graduates\nrushing into the job scenes and beginning their\nascent on the career ladder. Anders and Landey,\nhowever, have an approach unlike that of many\nrat-race competitive Imperial graduates.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that as a graduate you need to\nget a job with any of the companies from any\nof the careers fairs, you don\u2019t,\u201d Anders advised.\n\u201cYou can do anything you want, go anywhere\nyou want. What you have achieved by graduating from Imperial will stick with you for a long\ntime.\n\u201cOn a piece of paper \u2013 i.e. your CV \u2013 you\nare no different to the other 300 students who\ngraduated with you. Employers want to see\nwhat you are like. Going out and exploring the\nworld and doing something amazing makes you\na whole lot more interesting.\u201d\n\u201cThe way I see it, the point of money is to buy\nexperiences,\u201d Landey added; \u201cI\u2019d rather work\nmy ass of for a summer and pay for six months\nof trekking in New Zealand, than going straight\ninto a high paying corporate job and never seeing outside your office window.\u201d\nYou can follow Anders\u2019 and Landey\u2019s epic\njourney by logging onto their website,\nTastytrek.com, or following their tweets @\nTastyTrek. They also hope to raise money\nfor two charities, Solar Light for Africa,\nLtd. and Water Aid \u2013 for details on how to\ndonate visit their website.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not go\nstraight into a high paying corporate job and\nnever see outside your\noffice window\u201d\nwho have completed a degree in material science and geology respectively, will attempt to\ntraverse the Te Araroa Trail, a 3030km track\nthat will take them from the northernmost point\nof New Zealand, Cape Reinga, to Bluff, its\nsouthernmost tip. Along with Anders\u2019 brother\nDamienmarc, they intend to set off in mid-November, aiming to complete the trek by the\nfollowing March.\nI asked them where the inspiration to trek\nacross New Zealand had sprung from. It turns\nout, according to Anders, to be a modern ad-venturer.\n\u201cBack in first year I stumbled upon a guy\ncalled Karl Bushby of the Goliath Exhibition\n\u2013 he\u2019s doing the longest unbroken walk in the\nworld. I wanted to do it too. I thought it would\nbe better to try out somewhere smaller at first.\nI thought about John o\u2019 Groats to Lands End\n\u2013 no too small. I thought about Australia \u2013 too\ndangerous.\n\u201cI visited New Zealand later that year, and\nthere it is: beautiful and challenging land-scapes, plenty of fresh water and nothing in the\nbush that could kill me.

    "content": "\u201c\nFELIX Friday 22 October 2010 35\nGAMES\nchanges to the overall format, have blindly\nfollowed the cries of the masses and literally\nregressed back to the beginning. Levels are instantly recognisable as carbon-copies of stages\nfrom Sonic 1, 2 and 3 and Sonic and Knuckles.\nTextures, enemies and even boss levels, although now presented in eyeball-popping high\ndefinition, have been simply copy-pasted into\nthe game with just a light brushing of visual\nmakeup. The only indication that there\u2019s been\nalmost twenty years of \u2018progress\u2019 since Sonic\nand Knuckles is the homing attack, a kind of\nauto-pilot that homes the blue fuzzball in on\nsprings and enemies. Even this is a pain to use\nas it\u2019s never quite clear why or when an enemy\nis or isn\u2019t a target. Everything is recycled and\nfor fans there\u2019s no challenge in giant walking\nrobots or fireball-shooting chameleons because\nthey\u2019ve all been seen before, and crucially,\ndone so much better.\nWhat changes there have been to the core run,\njump and spin will not be appreciated. Instead\nof game design that rewards the player\u2019s skill\nwith speed and rings, spike walls and enemies\nlie at random around every corner waiting for\n\u201cFans want a fresh\nexperience that still feels\nlike good ol\u2019 Sonic, not\na rehash that they\u2019ve all\nplayed before.\u201d\nP\noor Sonic has been having a bit of a\nrough time recently. Despite Mario\nand Luigi continuing their Godfather-esque dominance over pretty\nmuch any market they lay their\neyes upon, their spiky blue hedgehog nemesis\nhas enjoyed some high-profile, big-budget re-leases. However with a menagerie of arbitrary\nsupporting characters, a silly oversized sword\nand a transformation into a credulity-stretching\n\u2018werehog\u2019, to name but a few \u2018major innovations\u2019 to the franchise, it\u2019s no surprise that recent instalments have failed to make the dash\nto success.\nWith SEGA all but ready to give up the game,\nthey initiated the enigmatic \u2018Project Needlemouse\u2019: an attempt to recapture the winning\nformula of previous Sonic titles that the once-loyal fan base yearned for. With promises of a\ngenuine continuation of the original storyline\nand a return to classic side-scrolling Sonic, the\n\u2018project\u2019 became what we now see before us as\nSonic The Hedgehog 4.\nOn the surface it seems SEGA have at least\nbeen partially successful. Even if you\u2019ve never\nencountered Sonic before it\u2019s hard not to be\ncharmed by the introductory \u201cSEGAAAA\u201d yell\nand the cute and very retro menus. The first level will bring a smile to your face with the thrill\nof sending the spinning blue hedgehog hurtling\ndown hills, up pipes and along helix-shaped\nbridges. The obligatory \u2018ancient pyramid\u2019, \u2018underwater\u2019and \u2018steam power gone wrong\u2019levels\nmake the style feel a little dated but the graphics and music are pleasant enough and there is\nsome genuinely decent platforming fun to be\nhad. Breaks from the usual mechanics can also\nbe found in mine cart and boulder balancing\nsections, but these are used too sparingly to be\nanything more than a gimmick.\nEventually though, casual players will become frustrated by Sonic\u2019s broken level design\nand steep difficulty curve. It doesn\u2019t take long\nfor you to fall into one of the almost maliciously placed spike walls or to become stuck in a pit\nwith no immediate or intuitive form of escape.\nSonic himself is painfully and lethargically\nslow until he\u2019s reached his top speeds which\nmakes the game bringing you to a complete\nfull stop all the more flow-disrupting. Although\ntolerable for some of the early \u2018Splash Hill\u2019 or\n\u2018Casino Street\u2019 levels, anything later than this\nwill cause even a well-adjusted player to throw\ntheir controller to the ground in frustration.\nIt\u2019s inherently obvious that this game was not\ndesigned for casual players. There\u2019s no tutorial\nso anyone not already familiar with Sonic has\nto look up the controls and despite promises of\na new storyline there is simply no plot to be\nfound. Nostalgic Sonic veterans will be wooed\nby the presence of the original two-tone checkerboard textures and side-scrolling gameplay,\nand it becomes excruciatingly clear that this\ngame was designed, drawn and developed exclusively for the fans of the original series.\nSEGA however, instead of making tentative\nAnother chronic Sonic failure\nMatt Colvin and Simon Worthington attempt to enjoy Sonic The Hedgehog 4\nyou to bumble innocently into them. Bottomless life-draining pits are also shamefully unmarked so it\u2019s impossible to know when you\nfall if you\u2019re falling to your doom or not. Sonic\nThe Hedgehog 4 is now a game of memory and\nchance, not of skill. The only way to become an\nexpert is to simply play the levels enough times\nuntil you know exactly what lies ahead. This is\nintrinsically not what the original Sonic series\nwas all about. It\u2019s undeniable that there was always some trial-and-error associated with the\nearly games, but not nearly on the same magnitude as is present here.\nThis is brought sharply into focus during the\nfinal boss battle, taking place on Dr. Eggman\u2019s\nspace station. After an epic battle which unnecessarily includes all of the earlier bosses,\nwith mere seconds left on the timer and with\nthe final, definitive blow landed on the robot\nmecha, the floor beings to crumble beneath the\nhedgehog and he falls, almost predictably, to\nhis doom. No explanation. No indication that\nthis was going to happen. Eventually we had to\ntext 118118 to even work out what the hell was\ngoing on, and it was helpfully divulged that unless you are standing in a completely arbitrary\npoint on the screen so you can see where the\nboss lands to bonk him on the head, you die. No\nskill, just memory and chance. All this could\neven have been avoided if the camera didn\u2019t\nsuck so badly, as it never zooms out to show\nthe boss, enemy or anything else that players\ndesperately need to see.\nInitially, Sonic 4 certainly is fun for casual\ngamers, as zooming Sonic around all over the\nplace is enjoyable and some of the later platforming is genuinely good. Despite this it\u2019s\nsimply not long enough (weighing in at about\nfive or six hours to get to the last level) and\nis far too infuriating to warrant the hefty price\ntag. More \u2018episodes\u2019 are also planned so to get\nthe full experience SEGA will be expecting\nplayers to shell out more of their cash.\nAs for the fans, SEGA have given them the\nexact opposite of what they want. Sonic The\nHedgehog 4 has the platforming and graphics\nof the original series combined together with\nthe faulty design principles of the \u2018new\u2019 Sonic\ngames. What players actually want to see is\noriginal and new storylines, game modes and\ngraphics that follow the classic Sonic design\nphilosophy. Fans want a fresh experience that\nstill feels like good ol\u2019 Sonic, not a rehash of\ngames from the \u2018glory days\u2019 that they\u2019ve all\nplayed before. It\u2019s a true disappointment that\nSonic 4 simply doesn\u2019t live up to either the\nhype or the expectation placed upon it, and one\ncan only hope that there\u2019s enough time between\nnow and Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 2 for\nSEGA to fully understand the mistakes in what\nthey\u2019ve produced.\nSonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 1 is out\nnow on PSN, Xbox Live Arcade, WiiWare\nand iOS. Prices vary according to plat-form.\n\n"

We thought: \u201cLet\u2019s do science in a Kiss way.\u201d It\u2019s called Droppin\u2019\nScience, packed full of post-production,\nreally heavy beats in the background so\nif you\u2019re listening to it on the train or\nthe way to college or work, the people\naround you commuting won\u2019t necessarily know that you\u2019re a massive geek,\nbecause they\u2019ll hear all the beats going\non. It\u2019s meant to be two young guys, in\nthe pub, chatting some science. It\u2019s a\nbit entertaining as well as being infor-mative, scratching on the side of the\ncooler, weirder science topics. The more\nlight-hearted the better. There are some\nserious aspects to it, but we try to cover\nthem in weird ways. We started looking\ninto the heart of the science behind Avatar, and got into some quite deep moral\nquestions. But we\u2019re tackling it from a\ncool perspective.\nThere\u2019s another thing I\u2019m working on\nat the moment which is going to be a\nschool show, with the Royal Institution,\ncalled DJ Physics, almost trying to justify my existence, because they\u2019re not\nthat far apart. I\u2019ll be looking at DJing\nfrom the scientific point of view. See\nwhat\u2019s really going on. Club DJing,\nmixing, tackling that from the point of\nview of looking at the equipment, picking out the 4 key processes that go along\nwith them, and getting into the science\nof what you\u2019re doing to the music, to\nthe sounds. Some really deep concepts\nare behind that, which actually spread\nacross the whole of physics, so I think\nit\u2019s really good to get that across. I think\nthat from a proper point of view you\nonly learn these in the first year of Uni,\nso it\u2019d be really great to get that across\nto kids. Without getting into the maths,\njust seeing what\u2019s going on and linking it across to the other areas. DJs are\nquantum physicists, they\u2019re astrophysi-cists, they can make silicon chips and\ncan design robotic artificial intelligence.\nThey\u2019re the four concepts that DJing can\napply to but there\u2019s so many others as\nwell.\nIs that going to be a regular thing or\njust a one off?\nThat\u2019s a show we\u2019re taking on a sort of\ntour, so we\u2019re going to start trying it next\nmonth, it\u2019s being put on at the Faraday\nlecture theatre at the Royal Institution.\nI\u2019ll be doing a talk where Michael Faraday told everyone about electromagne-tism, which is very cool. Hopefully we\u2019ll\nget to take that to some other schools, to\nsome science festivals next summer.\nWith DJing being such a big thing\nnowadays, hopefully it might get kids\nmore interested in physics.\nYeah, it\u2019s something a bit more relat-able and to be honest it\u2019s packed full of\nawesome songs so they\u2019re not gonna fall\nasleep, I\u2019m gonna be banging out the\ntunes.\nWould you be interested in moving towards television?\nDefinitely. It\u2019s part of doing the PhD\nreally, to get back into the research\ncommunity, and then to bring my two\ncareers together, my media and my sci-ence. There\u2019s only so much you can do\non the radio in terms of science. TV\u2019s\ngreat, so much more visual, and there\u2019s\nso much visual stuff in Physics in certain areas to look at, especially Plasma\nPhysics which I\u2019m doing at the moment.\nI think Plasma\u2019s some of the most beautiful things I\u2019ve ever seen, absolutely\nstunning phenomena associated with\nthem. And when you get a TV show\nyou get to travel all around the world, I\nwouldn\u2019t turn my nose up at that!\nAre you doing any DJ sets soon?\nHaven\u2019t got any booked but I do do\nthem. I actually do WiiJ sets as well.\nThat\u2019s DJing with the Nintendo Wii\ncontroller, I wrote some software to interpret the signals and then control some\nDJ software with it, so it\u2019s real gestural\nDJing, by waving my arms around. A lot\nof people don\u2019t get it. They\u2019re just like\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Then you muck\nabout with some tunes, so much fun.\nIt puts so much control into these two\ncontrollers that I just love doing it for\nmyself to be honest.\nAre you quite keen on new interfaces\nfor DJing then?\nYeah definitely, I\u2019m really into digital\nDJing. Some people have started using\nthe iPad to DJ, there\u2019s so many people\nwho use iPhones to trigger stuff. I\u2019m really interested in that sort of thing, seeing what people can do with DJing, to\nmake it a bit more interesting. A lot of\npeople fault it and say it\u2019s not as interesting as vinyl, especially with people\nwho just use trackpads and mice. That\u2019s\nnot very visual, you can\u2019t really understand what they\u2019re doing; it\u2019s boring to\nlook at. So let\u2019s just make it a bit more\ninteresting. Because it is so much more\npowerful on a laptop. There\u2019s people\nwho say it\u2019s sacrilege, and you should\nuse vinyl, but get with the 21st century!\nIt\u2019s so much fun DJing on your laptop,\nso why not make it a bit more of a visual\nspectacle as well?\nDJ\u2019s who are very serious about it\ncome up with their own solutions. Like\nSasha, who\u2019s a massive pioneer of\nAbleton DJ sets. He built his own con-troller, it\u2019s absolutely massive, but it\u2019s\ngorgeous. He\u2019s got so much control on\nit. It\u2019s got lights and indicators and he\nbuilt it himself.\nI think if you\u2019re a DJ who\u2019s a music\ngeek, you always look at a DJ\u2019s kit, because everyone uses different stuff and\nconfigures it in their own special way.\nIt\u2019s really cool to see what people do.\nJust get pally with whatever DJ\u2019s playing and see what he\u2019s using, or she. It\u2019s\neven cooler if it\u2019s a girl. There\u2019s just\nsomething about girl DJs. DJing is a\nvery geeky thing, you gotta spend so\nmuch time learning how to do it, rewiring your brain. So to see girls who actually put the time in to do it, it\u2019s all the\nmore impressive.\nCheck out www.martinarcher.co.uk\nfor more info on Droppin\u2019 Science\nFind this playlist at:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/FelixAngry\n\u201cI\u2019m not fucking around\u201d sings Stevens.\nHe certainly isn\u2019t. After 5 long years,\nSufjan finally returns with a more direct and challenging full length album\nthan his last, blending the orchestral\nwith the electronic. Rather than focussing on an abstract theme such as his\nprevious LPs on US states or the Chinese Zodiac, Stevens\u2019 main subject for\nthis album is himself, producing a raw,\nemotional and altogether more forceful result than 2005\u2019s delicate Illinois.\nRich, compelling and complex, The Age\nof Adz\u2019s lyrical and compositional intelligence allows for growing enjoyment\nwith every listen.\n- Charlotte Ridler\nSufjan Stevens\nThe Age of Adz\nAsthmatic Kitty\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\u2018Rape Gaze\u2019. The phrase has been causing controversy in the last few weeks\nafter Pitchfork issued a statement officially retracting its use from a review of\nSalem\u2019s new album King Night.\nFirst coined by the band CREEP, it\nrefers to an emerging genre characterised by haunted, atmospheric music\nwith vocoder manipulated vocals; also\nreferred to as \u2018Witch House\u2019, \u2018Drag\u2019 or\n\u2018Haunted House\u2019. The band have now\ndisowned it, commenting, \u201cIt was a play\non words which we never expected to be\nused as an actual genre\u201d. Now however\npretentious this may be, it does raise\ninteresting questions. What counts as\na genre? What meaning does the term\nhave anymore? And what the fuck do\nthese words even mean in the first place?\nThis rapid branding and debranding\nof genres appears to be occurring in the\nindustry with remarkable frequency. So\nfar within the last year, we\u2019ve received\ntwo new \u2018genres\u2019 under the guise of\nChillwave and the aforementioned Rape\nGaze/Witch House. However, it doesn\u2019t\nend there: a whole slew of new bands\nhave dominated the blogs this summer,\nall of a similar fuzzy, surfer, weed-induced disposition just waiting to be\nlabeled as \u201cBeachwave\u201d. And that\u2019s not\ncounting last years Neoshoegaze, Afropop, Zef\u2026\nThis explosion of genre labeling hasn\u2019t\nbeen unnoticed by the blogosphere either.\nSatire blog Hipster Runoff allegedly invented chillwave by promoting the term\nincessantly, and one look at their now\nclassic \u201cGenre Shirt\u201d, where real genres\n(such as Nintendocore and Crabcore) are\nalmost indistinguishable from fake ones\n(such as Poetrygaze, and my personal favourite Googlewave) shows how far this\nhas penetrated the indie culture.\nBut why? What is so appealing about\nidentifying music with incomprehensible words? The most obvious reason is\nRAPE GAZE...\nthe invention of music blogging, where\nthe everyman with a keyboard and an\nopinion suddenly has a platform to talk\nand discuss any and all music available.\nIn times gone by, small movements of\nbands would arise in cities or under a record label, cultivating a sound through\na tight nit community which could take\nyears to establish. Today, a blogger can\npick bands seemingly out of the air, regardless of geographic location or level\nof talent, and brand them under some\nnew term, which can gain wider recognition in the space of a few weeks.\nThis consequently has positive and\nnegative effects. The good news is that\nthis high turn around from artist discovery to classified genre means that\nwhen combined with the short-term attention spans of blogs, it creates a cycle\nof constant innovation. New sounds are\nconstantly bought forward, and only the\nbest will survive, producing a vast variety of new music, often rewarding and\nof high quality.\nThe bad news is obvious: it\u2019s often\nconfusing, pretentious, not really nec-essary, and anyone who doesn\u2019t keep a\nday-to-day tab on the latest blogs quickly becomes out of the loop. This forces the mainstream and the alternative\ngenres further and further apart, leaving\nautotuned monstrosities to take over the\ncharts and the Hipsters cradling their\nSleigh Bells and Washed Out vinyls.\nWhilst I might have come across as\nsomewhat disparaged by this new genre\ncycle, it can\u2019t be ignored that overall this\nis a good thing for anyone with two ears\nand a reasonable taste in music. Whilst\nthese names might come across as idi-otic, they only serve the wider purpose\nof uniting bands under a theme, which\ncan possibly begin to break, and influ-ence, the mainstream (The New York\nTimes recently ran an article on Chillwave for instance). Let\u2019s just hope they\npick something more suitable than Rape\nGaze next time.\n...and other blog-derived genres\nChris Dean\n\n"

For this rea-son, I found Alicia Drake\u2019s account of\nthe turbulent journey of the fashions two\ngreatest rivals, Yves Saint Laurent and\nKarl Lagerfeld into stardom, refreshingly honest and insightful. Beautifully written and well-researched, the\nbook describes the lives of these two\nartistic geniuses who had to battle with\ntheir personal demons to create sartorial masterpieces that would embody a\nquickly changing world full of parties,\nrebellion and globalization.\nOther reviews comment about\nhow YSL comes out on top in this\nbook as the tormented artist that,\nlike a magnet, attracted fashion\u2019s\nelite, whilst Karl Lagerfeld as a\nstruggling couturier who was unable\nto create his own style and\nso turned his hand\nto pr\u00eat-a-porter.\nHowever, I think\nboth were shown to be brilliant but with\ntheir own flaws; I found myself warming to both, despite their eccentricities.\nDespite the book\u2019s focus on the two,\nthe character leaving the largest mark\nwas Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s muse, Jacques de\nBascher. His lavish lifestyle and the aesthetic obsession which led to his self-destruction inspired the title: \u201cCadent\ncomes from the Latin cadere, which\nmeans to fall. Decadent is something\nvery different, it\u2019s the beautiful way to\nfall.

Or rather, a brain\nhaemorrhage. And it is Facebook who struck\nthe blow. It started with Sheryl Sandberg, once\nGoogle\u2019s Vice President of Global Online Sales\nand Operations, now Facebook\u2019s first Chief\nOperating Officer. Then Erik Tseng, a high\nlevel product manager of Google\u2019s Android\nhopped on to Facebook to lead its mobile strat-egy. Trailing along was Google\u2019s \u2018rockstar\u2019\ndeveloper and head of the Chrome OS proj-ect, Matthew Papakipos. He went to Facebook\nright before the completion of Chrome OS.\nToday, more than 100 Googlers have defected to Facebook amidst extraordinary counteroffers on behalf of Facebook. Tech Crunch\njoked that Googlers should consider an offer\nfrom Facebook just for the sake of getting\nGoogle to drastically increase their salary.\nThe mass migration of Googlers to Facebook\nindicates one thing: Facebook might just be the\nnext big thing.\nAnd it may even be bigger than Google. Still\na privately held company, analysts are predicting that Facebook\u2019s IPO would be larger than\nGoogle\u2019s when Google went public in 2004,\nreports The Financial Times. Part of the reason why those brilliant Silicon Valley luminaries at Google are flocking to the whelp of a\ncompany that is Facebook, is to own a small\nchunk of a company that might, as the whispers go, be valuated at $100 billion not too\nfar in the future, reports Michael Arrington of\nTech Crunch.\nThe social network company is going to get\nbigger than the Facebook as we know it today,\nbecause it is just the beginning of something\ntruly revolutionary. Not satisfied with permeating the fabric of our online social life, Facebook aims to extend its tentacles to the mobile\nplatform (now it makes sense to steal Google\u2019s\nTseng and Papakipos). Joe Hewitt, one of\nFirefox\u2019s founders, developed the immensely\npopular Facebook iPhone app. The new Places\nfeature brings real-world interaction with Facebook to another level, by feeding your current\nlocation to Facebook via your mobile. Tech\nCrunch reports rumours that both Hewitt and\nPapakipos are in charge of a \u2018top secret\u2019 Facebook initiative, to create a Facebook phone to\ncounter the competition from Apple\u2019s iPhone\nand Google\u2019s Android phones.\nHitting the mobile market is the next sensible\nstep, as there is only so much you can do with\na website alone, unless you lug a laptop around\nwith you everywhere you go. As Arrington\npoints out, there is only so much Facebook\ncould reach with an app on those platforms,\nunless it creates its own tight integration with a\nmobile operating system.\nThen there is Facebook Connect, which enables you to log onto websites outside Facebook, using your Facebook account, and the\nnew Facebook Credits which critics think\nmight be able to usurp PayPal in the future.\nBoth Facebook Connect and Credits could lay\nthe groundwork to transform the Facebook\nplatform into a global village that transcends\nborders, with its own passport (your Facebook\naccount) and currency (Facebook Credits).\nFacebook has the potential to be bigger than\nMicrosoft. Bill Gates created the most popular\nplatform for personal computing, but Zuckerberg created a platform that embeds itself into a\nmore fundamental aspect of human life: our social networks. In The Facebook Effect, Zuckerberg likens social networking to Moore\u2019s law\n\u2013 that processor capability grows exponentially\nover the years. The quantity of information exchanged over social networks should increase\nexponentially over subsequent years. Zuckerberg thinks that we are inevitably heading\ntowards a more transparent world, a zeitgeist\nsome find discomforting. Regardless, he sees\nFacebook as a tool to help people adopt open-ness.

With\nthis in mind, when you hear about Imperial\nCollege\u2019s Cinema, you may very well envision some shabby little screen and one lonely\nfilm geek hunched over a DVD player, but you\nwould be wrong. Just above the newly opened\nFiveSixEight, the Union Concert Hall hides\na 33ft screen and, with a professional 35mm\nprojector and full Dolby Surround Sound, the\niCU Cinema rivals any average Odeon or Cineworld in London.\nIf you didn\u2019t know this, though, you\u2019d be\neasily forgiven. It\u2019s been a rough few years\nfor the CinemaSoc which, in its heyday, used\nto draw in a decent crowd and actually make\nmoney \u2013 a thing that hasn\u2019t happened in about\nsix years. According to Tom Rushton, current\nChief Projectionist and former Chair, it\u2019s been\na \u201cdownward spiral\u201d since around 2004 and\none that showed little hope of recovery on its\nown.\nThe decline of iCU\u2019s Cinema is a snowballing of bad luck and minor mistakes. In 2008,\nthere was so little interest in the cinema that\nonly four of the six posts on the committee\nwere actually filled and, as Freshers\u2019 Fair ap-proached, the Chair for that year went AWOL,\nforgetting to inform the rest of the committee\nhe\u2019d failed his exams. With two of the remaining three members present, and with four days\nleft before Fresher\u2019s fair, Rushton was given\nthe unenviable role of chairing this flagging\nsociety. By the Spring term, nothing was showing and the only thing they had gained was one\nmore member of staff.\nThe next academic year seemed to follow\nthis theme of staff drop-outs (they lost their\nchair, vice-chair and treasurer in the next Autumn term) and building work at the Union cut\nJade Hoffman\noff the remaining staff members from most of\nthe equipment in the projection booth. When\niCU Cinema informed the Union it was officially going \u201cdormant\u201d it went pretty much\nunnoticed \u2013 with zero publicity and very little\nto publicise in the first place, few people at\nImperial had really noticed it had existed at\nall.\n\u00a350,000 is, however, a lot of Union money to\nbe spent on highly specialised equipment gathering dust over the concert hall and, over this\nsummer, a new committee was put together. In\nwhat seems to be the trend, the new Chair \u2013\nCharlotte Ivison \u2013 was forced to drop out after\nbeing elected DPW, but replacing her is 2nd\nyear physicist Chandana Shankar, who is keen\nto see the cinema back on its feet and enjoying\nthe success of its former years.\nSpeaking to Felix about the future of iCU\nCinema, Shankar said, \u201cPeople can expect\niCU Cinema to show recently released popular films in a complete cinema environment at\nstudent-friendly prices.\u201d In order to avoid the\nfailings of its past, the cinema is looking to\nshow high-demand blockbusters and organise\nsocial events to foster a stronger loyalty in its\nmembers.\nPerhaps you have to see it to believe it, but for\nanybody with even a vague interest in films, a\nvisit to iCU Cinema is worth the \u00a33, especially\nas cinema ticket prices often hit upwards of\n\u00a310 in most London cinemas. Despite its shaky\nfew years, iCU Cinema finally seems in a good\nposition to make a comeback. Kicking off with\nInception this Tuesday 26th at 6.30pm in the\nUnion Concert Hall, the resurrected iCU Cinema promises more films like this to follow,\nwith Toy Story 3, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World,\nand The Social Network all in the pipeline. So\nif you\u2019re getting a drink at the new bar, it\u2019d be\nworth bringing it upstairs to enjoy Christopher\nNolan\u2019s latest critically-acclaimed mindfuck,\nand supporting the return of iCU Cinema in\nall its glory.\niCU Cinema finally\nseems in a good\nposition to make a\ncomeback\n\u201c\nyears\nars\ny, used\nused\nmake\nmak\nabout\nabout\nurrent\nurrent\ns been\nbeen\niCU Cine\niCU Cine\nseems in\nms i\n\u201d\nfici\nfic\nunn\nunn\nto p\nto p\nImp\nImp\nall.\nal\n\u00a3\nbe s\nod\nd\nke a\nke a\nClassic Cinema\nFight Club\nThe film starts off with a painful observation of a\nchronic insomniac-cum-office drone and his exploration of consequence, human psychology and violence\nas therapeutic means to cull the antagonism of his\nmiserable existence. This soon leads him to seek\nsolace in the arms of various support groups as he\npursues the crucial emotional nurture he feels he is\nwithout, and it is here that our nameless hero meets\nthe intriguing Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter).\nTheir relationship soon progresses to a sexual peak,\nhowever we are often left unsure of events as we can\nonly view the entirety of it through the hazy eyes of\nthe narrator. Bonham Carter delivers a flawless performance as Ms. Singer, a cunning hybrid of a na\u00efve\nyet tarnished pawn who is an essential addition to\nthis male-centric film.\nThe film starts to become tangible when, during\na business flight, our protagonist happens to come\nacross a questionably liberal soap-salesman, Tyler\nDurden (Brad Pitt) which eventually leads to a fist\nfight outside a bar. This sparks off what is soon to\nbe epically established as a Fight Club.

So in light of the\nspending review, have the Liberal Democrats broken their election promises?\nIt\u2019s worth having a look back to the\nmanifesto they released before May\u2019s\ngeneral election. In it, they clearly and\nstrongly outlined their commitment\nto both education, through the scrapping of \u201cunfair tuition fees\u201d, and sci-ence: \u201cIn the current economic climate\nit is not possible to commit to growth\nin spending, but Liberal Democrats\nrecognise the importance of science\ninvestment to the recovery and to\nthe reshaping of the economy.\u201d\nThis had enticed a large number of\nnew voters who were not happy with\nthe attitudes of the other parties. The reaction to Vince Cable\u2019s speech at Queen\nMary, University of London in September should therefore not have been unex-pected. His remarks, considered by some\nto be incredibly ignorant, about cutting\nout \u201cresearch which is neither commercially useful nor theoretically outstanding\u201d stirred up a lot of heated emotions.\nImperial wins as scien\nMatthew Colvin\nKatherine Bettany\nSophia David\nImperial focus\nWhy Imperial will be all right\nWith dark clouds looming over many universities, it\u2019s\nnot all doom and gloom for Imperial. Ranked 9th in\nthe world by The Times this year, bright students\nfrom all corners of the globe compete for a place at\nImperial. Such high demand is unlikely to change.\nIf the cap on tuition fees is lifted, as suggested\nby the Browne review, a free market is expected\nto drive down the costs for students as universities compete with one another. Whilst lessening\nthe financial burden on students, universities may\nconsequently not be able to acquire the full funding\nrequired to teach their courses. Whether fair or not,\nelite universities such as Oxbridge and Imperial may\nescape this market, being able to charge the full\ncosts of a world-class education.\nUniversities unable to fully replace the amount\nof government funding slashed this week with the\nequivalent rise in tuition fees are susceptible to\noverwhelming financial failure. Bankruptcy and private takeovers are inevitable, whilst massive restructuring of courses offered to students will be\nrequired, including a switch to \u2018STEM\u2019 subjects \u2013 sci-ence, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nImperial already focuses strongly on such subjects that the government is continuing to fund. So\nwe should lose out far less than our neighbours,\nthe Royal College of Music and the Royal College of\nArt. Institutions specialising in arts, humanities and\nsocial sciences may well be the biggest losers, as\nthey will see most of their funding cut.\nInevitably, poorer students are likely to be deterred from higher education if tuition fees soar.\nHowever, with no fee costs to pay upfront and an\naverage starting salary of \u00a328,116 following an undergraduate degree at Imperial, students here are\nmore likely to take on the financial risk than those\nconsidering less prestigious universities. Imperial\nshould be able to maintain its talent from all social\nbackgrounds.\nDespite tuition fees of over \u00a320,000 for undergraduate courses, Imperial boasts an international\n(non-EU) student population of a whopping 34.5%.\nThis shouts out about its status abroad. Imperial is\nconsequently in a strong position to use fees from\nwealthy international students to help cover the\ncosts of EU students. Further increases in non-EU\ntuition fees could be central in plugging the hole left\nby the government cuts and lessening the impact on\nBritish and European students.\nFinally, the announcement that the annual \u00a34.6\nbillion science budget will be frozen for the next four\nyears (a 10% reduction in real terms) brings an enormous sigh of relief to the research community. Cuts\nof up to 25% had been rumoured. The new settlement is also likely to lead to a greater proportion\nthe \u2018Quality-Related\u2019 stream, \u00a32 billion that is paid\ndirectly to universities instead of through research\ncouncils, be allocated to elite universities such as\nImperial. Job losses and scrapping of projects are\nless likely to be incurred here than at other non-research intensive universities.\nThere\u2019s no escaping the spending review is not exactly what we want to hear \u2013 the cost of obtaining\nan Imperial degree is going to be a hefty sum of\nmoney. But taking a step back and looking at the\nwider picture offers a glimmer of hope. Things could\nbe far worse and we should count ourselves as the\nlucky ones.\nSophia David\nfrom the government for full- and,\nfor the first time, part-time students.\nIn an unexpected move, Wednesday\u2019s\nSpending Review spared science and research from the brunt of the most hurtful\ncutssuchasthoseaffectingwelfare.Even\ndays before this, statements were being\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nmade behind the scenes regarding the\nhigh possibility of a freeze in the science\nbudget. These claims ultimately came to\nfruition during George Osborne\u2019s formal announcement, in which he detailed\nthat the science budget would indeed\nbe protected at \u00a34.6 billion per year.\n\u201cBritain is a world leader in scientific research and that is vital to our\nfuture economic success,\u201d he said.\nThe freeze in the budget, when adjusted for inflation, means that there will\nstill be a cut in the budget, but at just under 10% it is well below earlier estimates\nsuch as 25%. The success has been at-BROKEN\nPROMISES\nSo when the spending cuts were announced today people must have been\nbreathing a sigh of relief, having feared\nthe worse. Despite science and environment receiving a 9% cut, Liberal DemocratMPsmustfeelthattheirpledgedcom-mitment to science hasn\u2019t been entirely\noverlooked in the coalition government.\nHowever, despite receiving the smallest budget cut across the many Whitehall departments, it is predicted that education will suffer when the government\nacts on the recently published Browne\nreport to remove the cap of tuition\nfees. This flies in the face of the Liberal Democrats manifesto pledge and\nleave many deeply unhappy or with an\nuncertain academic future. The extent\nto which this will now affect education\nnow lies in the hands of the universities.\nconfirmed that the \u00a3324 million pounds\nof savings made in the sector would be\nsaved through efficiency, and not by\n\u2018cash cuts\u2019. So, whilst the Imperial research departments may not be as badly\naffected as previously suspected, the\nteaching budget will certainly face cuts.\nIn a time where economic sustainability\nis everything, perhaps more departments\nwill follow the lead of the department\nof Life Sciences in their restructure.\nGovernment funding from higher\neducation is to be cut by \u00a32.9 billion\n(40%) from \u00a37.1 billion to \u00a34.2 billion,\nby 2014-2015. This will shift a greater\nproportion of the funding for university\nteaching from the taxpayer to the student.\nTherefore, the major effect on students\nis going to be the soaring of tuition fees\nand the subsequent debt to repay. The\nspending review accepts Lord Browne\u2019s\nreport and states that universities will be\nable to increase graduate contributions\nfrom the 2012-2013 academic year.\nLuckily for many of us, we will have\ngraduated by then. But the BMA have\nalready warned ministers that if tuition\nfees are levied at around \u00a310,000, future medical students could face debts\nof around \u00a370,000 on leaving university \u2013 a crippling financial burden.\nIn future, the choice of university may\nbe based on financial rather than academic reasoning with students shying\naway from elite universities owing to\ntheir higher costs. To reduce social prej-udice, a \u00a3150 million National Scholarship fund introduced by 2014-2015\nwill support students from low-income\nbackgrounds as well as low-income\ngraduates. There will be loan support\nElizabeth Crouch\n...Continued from Front Page\n\u201cWednesday\u2019s Spending Review\nspared science and research\nfunding from the brunt of the\nmost hurtful cuts.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "\u201c \u201d\nGAMES\nFELIX\nFriday 22 October 2010\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a graphic adventure survival horror game that had me swapping out trousers on a regular basis, and I shall\nendeavour to convey why this little-known\ngem is so worthy of attention. First though, a\nlittle introduction to Frictional Games, and the\ncurrent state of the survival horror genre.\nFrictional Games is a small independent\nvideo game company based in Helsingborg,\nSweden (don\u2019t feel you have to look it up on\nthe map). The company\u2019s only other product is\na three-part series called Penumbra, which is...\nwell, it\u2019s another graphic adventure survival\nhorror series, but so what? Frictional Games\npulled off the genre so well in Penumbra that\nit was only logical that they should create a\ndifferent game based on the same genre, only\nthis time using an advanced version of their\nown HPL game engine (named after the initials of H. P. Lovecraft, from whom Frictional\nGames draw a lot of inspiration). Don\u2019t worry\nif you haven\u2019t heard about any of this before \u2013 I\nhadn\u2019t either, until I stumbled upon the Penumbra series a few months back.\nMost modern survival horror titles have a\nproblem, a problem the big video game companies aren\u2019t fixing. In a word (or five), they\u2019re\njust not scary anymore. Take for example an old\nfavourite of mine: Dead Space. If you haven\u2019t\nheard of it (shame on you!), it is in essence a\nthird-person survival horror game set aboard a\ngiant space ship, where you play as a plucky\nspace engineer fighting off the horribly mutated\nremnants of the ship\u2019s crew. Now don\u2019t get me\nwrong, Dead Space, along with other survival\nhorrors out there, is fun \u2013 just not that scary.\nSure, they\u2019ll make you jump in your seat, but I\ncould name a lot of things that make me jump\nthat aren\u2019t considered scary \u2013 my cat, for exam-ple. With the slew of fierce-looking weapons\nmost survival horrors throw at you, gameplay\ndevolves from a tense horror-filled nightmare\nto an elaborate monster shooting gallery. It\u2019s\nfun, but it\u2019s like ordering a banana split and\nreceiving a fillet steak \u2013 I like fillet steak, and\nI\u2019ll eat it, but I would have much preferred my\nbanana-based dessert.\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent delivers the\nmetaphorical banana split. You play as some\npoor sap called Daniel who wakes up in a large\nmedieval castle with no idea what\u2019s going on\n\u2013 you could say he has amnesia. Luckily, Daniel was smart enough to write notes for himself which are scattered around the castle and\nalong with flashbacks at certain locations in the\ncastle, serve to advance the plot. For the first\nfew minutes you\u2019ll have no idea why you\u2019re\nthere, or what you\u2019re meant to do. However, the\nfirst note you find soon puts you on track. It\u2019s\nrevealed that Daniel induced his own amnesia\nby drinking some sort of potion, and his former\nself instructs him to find and murder an old guy\ncalled Alexander, who\u2019s hiding in the depths of\nthe castle. Notes throughout the game add to\nthe story, revealing more about Daniel\u2019s past,\nbut towards the end these snippets of text grow\nmore confusing rather than intriguing and it often requires a second playthrough for it to make\nsome sort of sense (which I\u2019d recommend, if\nonly to listen to the developer\u2019s commentary).\nThe game is set in the 19th century, and as\nsuch there\u2019s no high-tech weaponry \u2013 in fact,\nthere is no weaponry at all. You have yourself,\na lantern, and the ability to run and hide like\na scared child. Frictional Games realises that\nfor a survival horror game to be tense, you actually have to feel like you\u2019re surviving, and\nbarely, not just strolling about the levels like\nyou\u2019re a T-1000. There\u2019s no direct health bar in\nAmnesia, but opening up the inventory gives\nyou some idea of what state you\u2019re in: either\n\u2018Healthy\u2019, \u2018Cuts and Bruises\u2019, or \u2018On Death\u2019s\nDoor\u2019.\nThat is, if you can find any of the monsters\nto lose health from. Again, Frictional Games\nrealises that everyone has different fears \u2013 a\ntarantula can either be a worst nightmare or an\nadorable pet. Amnesia seriously messes with\nyour mind: footsteps can be heard above and\nbehind you, you hear the cries of slavering\nbeasts that never materialise, at some points\nyour screen will distort, screams will be heard\nand suspicious red fluid will dribble from the\nwalls, but each and every time an enemy will\nfail to appear. Yet you will always keep a watch\nbehind you, always fearing something will pop\nout and require you to change your underwear.\nThe phrase \u2018less is more\u2019 springs irresistibly to\nmind.\nThe crowning feature of Amnesia is how\nyou deal with baddies when you do finally find\nthem, or as is more often, when they find you.\nWhat do you do? You run and hide. In my first\nencounter I tried to run past the baddie only to\nbe swiped in the head and knocked to the floor.\nSecond time around I ran into a room, closed\nthe door and hid in a cupboard as the game\nsuggested just before the monster burst into the\nroom. I even peeked out once or twice to see\nhim rooting about. By the time I climbed out\nthe closet again my heart was thumping like a\ndarn drum.\nLight is also another focal point \u2013 after all,\nthere\u2019s not much of it. Stay in the darkness for\ntoo long, or see too many monsters or disturbing visions and your sanity will drain, represented by a decaying brain in your inventory\nmenu. The effect of low sanity will cause your\nscreen to blur as if you dropped your glasses\nor lost your contacts which does begin to irritate towards the end (though you can become\nsane again by completing the game\u2019s puzzles).\nLuckily you have a portable lantern at your\ndisposal as well as tinderboxes to light up\nstatic stuff such as candles and wall-mounted\ntorches. Both are limited resources but both\ncan be found with a little careful searching.\nBe warned, though: light acts like a homing\nbeacon for monsters trailing you. Bringing up\nmy lantern in a shadowy corner by mistake and\npromptly being slashed to death was a mistake\nI never made again.\nI could go on about the physics engine, but\nreally all I\u2019ll say is that it\u2019s wonderfully immer-sive with the ability to rotate and move objects\naround quite naturally. If you enjoy survival\nhorror, you really owe it to yourself to try Amnesia out. If you\u2019ve not played much survival\nhorror before, watch out \u2013 most other games\nwill feel lacklustre compared to it after comple-tion. If you play with headphones, and play at\nnight (as is highly recommended by myself and\nFrictional) you\u2019ll start forgetting it\u2019s a game\nand you\u2019ll truly be immersed in the disturbing\nworld of Amnesia.\nGraphic survival horror:\nthe forgotten genre\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nMoby Dick\nmostrogames.com/games/mobydick.html\nDespite the developer admitting that this game\nis what happens \u201cwhen you make a game from\na book you have never read\u201d, this 2D whale\nmunch-fest is surprisingly true to the original\ntext. Players must control the titular white whale\nusing the mouse, and have to destroy as many\nboats and munch on as many fish (and sailors)\nas they can without running out of air or health.\nSailors will bombard you with arrows and nets,\nand later bigger ships will arrive and fire cannonballs at you.\nAs you blitz your way through the ocean it\u2019s easy\nto overlook how pretty the game looks \u2013 there\u2019s\nclearly been a lot of attention to detail. It\u2019s also\ngot the quality of being \u2018easy to pick up, difficult to master\u2019, so there\u2019s plenty of gameplay to\nkeep coming back to.\nIn this defend-and-shoot game, you control an eye-patched rabbit commando defending his flag (and,\nindeed, himself) from hostile enemies. Quite why the\nenemies are disembodied fingers and all the action\nis played out amongst giant books and mugs of coffee is not easy to discern, but the mixture of tower\ndefence and top-down shooter is a good one.\nThe shooting aspect helps take the tedium out of\nwaiting for enemies to reach your towers \u2013 a common\nproblem in tower defence games \u2013 and the presence\nof towers provides a refreshing strategic element.\nBunny Flags\ntinyurl.com/bunnyflags\nLaurence Pope\n\u201cAmnesia seriously\nmesses with your mind\u201d\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent will give you the willies\n34\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix FRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY 2010\nFILM\nAlready looking like a dodgy Big Brother spin-off - the Chilean miners prepare for fame\nThe live feed of the Chilean miners\u2019\nrescue on the 13th October 2010 had it\nall: drama, suspense, and plenty of filler\nfrom the reporters on scene who were\ntrying to occupy the long pauses between anything actually happening in\nSan Jos\u00e9 de Copiap\u00f3. In this, a frequent\ntheme was what would happen to the\nminers once brought to the surface and\nmuch speculation as to the possibility\nof a film being made of the story. Ever\nsensitive to incidents of peril, the Felix\noffice and its film writers have put together several theories as to what kind\nof outcomes we might be able to expect\nfrom a dramatization of their sixty-nine\nday ordeal.\nSet down a dark, damp mine away\nfrom civilisation immediately creates\nthe perfect atmosphere for a film in the\nhorror or thriller genre. This could well\nbe the next title on the increasingly shit\nfilmography for M. Night Shyamalan\nwhose penchant for twist-endings and\noften supernatural goings on could easily be recreated down the Chilean mine.\nIn this, we see the thiry-three miners\ngrowing increasingly paranoid as they\ncrew could create a beautiful story about\nthirty-three trapped animals/toys/any\nobject with a face drawn on overcoming\ntheir differences and believing in them-selves. Possible titles include Miners\u2019\nInc. or Down.\nIf that\u2019s too lame for you, you can\nalways rely on Quentin Tarantino to\ndirect some stylish grindhouse flick\nstarring Samuel L.

Using\ntheir mandatory anthropomorphism and\nanimated charm, John Lasseter and his\nCynics beware: Julia Roberts\u2019Eat Pray Love\nDirector Ryan Murphy\nScreenwriter Ryan Murphy,\nJennifer Salt, Elizabeth Gilbert\nCast Julia Roberts, James Franco,\nJavier Bardem, Richard Jenkins\nEat Pray Love\nJohn Park\nIf you happen to have an ounce of cynicism in your body, avoid this like the\nplague, because for the cynics amongst\nyou, Eat Pray Love will no doubt be the\nmost self-indulgent film you will see all\nyear. But for those who are truly romantics at heart, one woman\u2019s pretty looking journey across the colourful globe\nto find the meaning of life, searching for\na true connection, will be something to\nmarvel at. Is she brave for venturing out\ninto the world, following her dreams?\nOr is she simply deluding herself into a\nmaterialistic journey? Are the problems\nin her life that serious?\nLiz (Julia Roberts) is a middle-aged\nwoman going through a divorce after\ndisastrous years of trying to make her\nmarriage work and is looking for some\nsort of consolation from a much younger\nman (James Franco). But the love affair\nis cooling off significantly, and she is\nonce again left alone, bored and unenthusiastic about life. She needs a change\nof scenery, and being a travel writer, she\ndecides to take an entire year out to do\nsome effective soul-searching.\nBefore we are able to see Julia Roberts\ngoing on the rather expensive-looking\ntrip, however, the film needs to establish\nthat Liz is leading a miserable existence.\nThis is where the casting of Roberts really pays off. Roberts, being the international superstar that she is, does not\ndisappoint, with her subtle glances of\nsadness and vulnerability setting an effective tone at the beginning of the film.\nShe has spent years worrying about her\nfuture, and now she needs fun.\nAnd it\u2019s a timeout to die for. In Rome\nshe decides to stop worrying about\ngaining weight. She\u2019s in Italy, there are\nsumptuous dishes of pizza and pasta and\nshe is not about to let a few pounds stop\nher from enjoying the endless amount\nof fantastic food that is on offer. There\u2019s\na particularly memorable scene where\nRoberts tucks into a rather simple looking spaghetti pomodoro, which in fact,\nturns out to be amazing. Accompanied\nby \u201cDer H\u00f6lle Rache,\u201d the famous\nQueen of the Night aria from Mozart\u2019s\nThe Magic Flute, the scene will make\nyour tummy growl as Roberts finds a\nbrief moment of true happiness with that\nplate of spaghetti.\nThen she\u2019s off to India, where she\nstays in a Hindu temple, finding peace,\npraying, connecting with God. But being\nnew to all of this, it\u2019s not easy to sit still,\npause, and meditate for hours and hours.\nShe meets a friendly old man from\nTexas, Richard (Richard Jenkins), who\nhelps her get rid of the burdens that are\npressing down on her shoulders. Jenkins\nprovides the only stand-out supporting\nperformance and in one intimate scene\nthat is handled perfectly by the actor, his\nmonologue will tug at the heartstrings.\nThe friendship between the two is often\nhumourous as well as deeply moving,\nand a lot of credit should go to Jenkins.\nGood-looking men surround Gilbert in Bali. She almost hooks up with\na much younger man, but the one that\nthreatens to steal her heart is the conveniently divorced Felipe (Javier Bardem),\nwhose business apparently lets him be\nwherever he wants to be (his words). So\nthe audience is confused later, when he\nalso goes on to say that his business is\nin Bali, so he cannot leave with Gilbert\nwhen she eventually plans to. Other than\nthat slight hiccup, Felipe seems to be the\nperfect man for her. Gilbert took this trip\nto be away from complications, to liberate herself, but it appears she needs a\nman after all to keep her happy.\nIt\u2019s hard to adapt a book that relies\nheavily on internal monologue. Eat\nPray Love is based on an enormously\npopular bestseller written by Elizabeth\nGilbert whose autobiography was an\ninstant hit for the readers and, despite\nthe excessive use of voiceovers, the\nfilm fails to show any depth relating to\nthis woman\u2019s year-long journey. It has a\nlengthy running time, but spends very\nlittle bit of it explaining to us just how\nsome of the events occur. The disjointed\nfeel is partly the editor\u2019s fault, but the\ncareless script should share the blame.\nShe\u2019s praying. What about? She connects with God. How? She finds Balance. Again, how? The soul-searching;\ndid she succeed? Was Felipe it? The\ncalm, soothing voice of Roberts, along\nwith some philosophical elements try to\ngive clever answers to the many questions that have been raised. But because\ndirector Ryan Murphy is so focused on\nshowing the beautiful, breathtaking aspect of her adventure, all that Eat Pray\nLove boils down to is nothing but a shallow travelogue with a fantastic leading\nactress but not much else.\nThe classic teenage-girl webcam shot is aptly recreated in \u00d6stland\u2019s film\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 22 October 2010 13\nBUSINESS\nDid Physics break the\neconomy? Can it save it?\nAfonso Campos explores the role of mathematical methods in the explosive cocktail\nthat led to the greatest economic meltdown in generations and questions their future\nA\nt the apogee of the mathematical finance movement in the mid-ninties,\nbillions were being made\nby pioneering science\nand finance academics and those who\nhad the foresight to see the increasing\nuse of these techniques. Louis Bachelier, the informal father of the discipline about a century ago, would have\nbeen proud. Bachelier speculated that\nbecause of the \u201cmemorylessness\u201d of\nstock market noise (that is, events that\nmomentarily alter the price of a stock\nin a way that does not reflect the general sentiment of the markets), stock\nprice increments are completely independent and able to be modeled by a\nGaussian distribution. Even after this\nwas postulated, academics were still\nunaccustomed to witnessing mathematics solving problems in finance. Now,\nhowever, a large slice of this so-called\nquantitative finance draws inspiration\nfrom the physical sciences, seen by\nsome purists as a pristine and sacred\ndiscipline. Physics, not unlike finance,\nconcerns itself with a seemingly infinite\nset of parameters, constantly changing\nand evolving; completely dynamic, so\nits use in the field is not as far a cry as\none may have initially thought.\nIn the good times, nothing could\nseemingly go wrong. In 1994, eleven\nprominent academics, bankers and financiers came together to form Long\nTerm Capital Management (LCTCM), a\nhighly mediatic hedge fund in Connecticut. The superstar team included Myron\nScholes who co-created and published\nthe famous \u201cBlack-Scholes Option Pricing Model\u201d. Given the experience of the\npartners, all evidence pointed to LTCM\nbecoming the most successful financial\ninstitution of all time, and the first few\nyears of activity lulled investors and the\nmarkets into a false sense of security\ngiven returns in excess of 40%. It was\nseen to be the epitome of quantitative\nfinance since Bachelier\u2019s initial paper.\nThe Oracle of Omaha, Mr Warren Buffett himself, called the derivatives used\nby houses like LTCM \u201cweapons of mass\ndestruction\u201d. At the time, he could not\nhave foreseen the extent to which his\nwords would become true. The financial\nworld slowly but surely began succumbing to the flaws in the models.\nChaotic, scared, unruled, disrespect-ed, anarchical, greedy, uncertain, melt-down, unfinished, prophetic; these are\nmerely a few groups of letters that spell\nthe sentiment of a world suffering a broken economy and spirit. The beginnings:\nwell known; a significant increase in\nmortgage defaults in the United States.\nThe consequences: immeasurable; trillions of dollars of financial devastation,\ncorporate collapse, record low consumer\nconfidence; possibility of deflation. In\norder to raise funds to lend money, mortgage providers repackaged their debt in\ncomplex financial products which they\nsold to supposedly responsible banks,\nensuring the ratings agency gave these\ninvestment vehicles very high ratings,\nfalsely deeming them suitable and a\nworthwhile investment. The banks\nthemselves increased the complexity of\nthese products and sold them on to investment funds with an appetite for su-pernormal returns and a carefree attitude\ntowards risk.\nThere are some who blame the high\nlevel and complexity of the mathematics\ninvolved for the crisis. Professor L.C.\nThomas of Southampton University\nsuggests that the crisis we are now feeling was created not necessarily by the\nmathematics but by an explosive combination of \u201cgreed and a conspiracy of\noptimism\u201d. The exoteric models created\nby the physicists and mathematicians\nhad actually worked surprisingly well\nin identifying problem areas in the debt\nmerry-go-round. The models, however,\nwere possibly far too complex for anyone other than their creators to under-stand, meaning that the average mortgage salesman felt detached from the\nprocess and became unwilling to \u2018listen\u2019\nto an abstract mathematical formula and\nbecame an irresponsible lender.\nIt is almost undeniable that mathematics has had a tremendous impact on the\ncrisis and is one of its catalysts. The ex-tent, however, is considered by leading\nacademics somewhat limited. Dr. Dorje\nBrody, a reader of mathematics and researcher in financial mathematics at Imperial College believes the models are\nonly to blame as they allowed products\n\u201cwhose contents are quite obscure to be\ntraded\u201d when their prices were being\nquoted on an \u201cad-hoc\u201d basis.\nThe consensus lies in the understanding that no matter what role the models\nplayed in the downturn of the economy,\nmathematics will be instrumental in fixing the situation. Dr Brody thinks that\nthat it will however depend on \u201cwhether\npeople come to the realisation that model building at a phenomenological level\nis feasible\u201d in the world of finance.\nThere is a widespread sentiment that\nfinancial institutions have ransacked\nand wrongly appropriated the techniques developed by physical scientists\nand mathematicians. Many believe that\nthose who learn the ideas of physics and\nmathematics and manipulate them for\nuse in the financial markets are, in one\nway or another, deviants of sorts, selling out their \u2018sacred\u2019 science. It\u2019s almost\nlike a Dr Faustus meets Mephistopheles\nscenario. The truth, however, is that in a\nnot so far-fetched way of thinking, physics and finance are in fact much more related in essence than one may initially\npostulate. Scraping the possibility of\nmalicious intent from either front, it is\nthen possible to come to the somewhat\nabstract conclusion that while both deal\nwith very fundamentally different ideas,\nthe two share a very paramount synergy.\nBoth fields aim to advance knowledge,\nevolve science and help ensure that the\nperpetual curiosity of mankind does not\ncease.\nMore importantly, they help observers gain a view of the world that throws\na welcome helping hand in making life\nbetter for a myriad of people. Given the\naccepted view that quantitative finance\nis here to stay, the necessity lies not in\naccepting that it draws from methods in\nthe physical sciences, but rather engaging in a symbiotic relationship with the\nbest minds in the field. Perhaps we will\ngo back to a simpler time and a financial\nsystem where the level of mathematical\nexoterism is diminished and people become once again the drivers of the markets and economy instead of an obscure\nformula developed in a small room on\nthe 54th floor of a sky-scraper in New\nYork City.\nThe use of mathematical methods in finance was so widespread, universities were worried about losing research talent to Wall Street\n\u201cModel building at\na phenomenological\nlevel is feasible\u201d \u2013 Dr\nDorje Brody\n\u201cPhysics and finance\nensure perpetual\ncuriosity does not\ncease.\u201d\n\n"

They are, by definition,\nhard-working and economically productive.\nThey face taxes as high as the wealthiest in\ntheir society, but find this reduces their ability to pay for relatively basic goods, such as\ntheir mortgage, rather than the ability to buy\nluxuries, like a Mediterranean holiday home.\nDespite this, they receive far fewer free or sub-sidised public services and benefits than the\npoorest in their societies.\nNew Labour managed to seize power from\nthe Tories by appealing to this sense of middle\nclass outrage; not by cutting their taxes (though\nthey effectively promised to not directly increase these) but by giving them greater access\nto the spending side; benefits were introduced\nto help the youngest and the oldest, regardless\nof wealth. This included giving winter fuel al-lowances, eye tests, prescriptions, travel passes\nand television licenses to the elderly and child\ntax credits to families. These universal benefits\nremained hugely popular with the electorate\nand were largely unquestioned by the Conservatives, then in opposition.\nThen the need for an emergency budget\nemerged and this aspect of government spending suddenly came under closer scrutiny. This\nis hardly surprising; it is a strange yet radical\nquirk in our economic system that emerged to\nappease the political environment without any\ndebate to justify it taking place. Now, with the\nbuzzwords \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018fair\u2019 being thrown\naround by Government, that long overdue debate is finally taking place in Downing Street,\nalbeit rather quietly. The debate, ideally, would\nalso be considered at a time when tax, as well\nas spending, was not under considerable pres-sure. Nevertheless, it\u2019s better late than never.\nIt was thought that this week\u2019s emergency\nbudget could well spell a clear end for the policy of universal benefits and a return to means\ntesting; the result on the day was, however,\nrather unclear. Perks for the over 75s were, by\nand large, maintained with the recent increase\nin the winter allowance being formally confirmed and guaranteed. This is, perhaps, related\nto the far more important move of state pension\nage being lifted to 66 by 2020; finding out that\nretirement will come later and cost more at the\nsame time can have a bad influence on voter\npsyche. Child benefits, on the other hand, have\nbeen cut for the wealthiest of families. This,\nadmittedly, had already been openly discussed\nand had broad support.\nThe government must consider whether this\naspect of government spending represents a\nshared universal necessity in our lives which\ncannot be afforded by many. In which case,\nlike health or education, it should be universal.\nOtherwise, if it is considered an emergency,\nand almost charitable, measure for the most\nunfortunate in society, such as unemployment\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nPhillipines\nAbout a quarter of the 5.6 million votes cast in the\nAfghan Parliamentary election have been voided\nby the Election Commission. This announcement\namidst allegations of widespread fraud and ballot\nstuffing in the Parliamentary election held on the\n18th which was widely seen as a test for Afghanistan\u2019s fledgling democracy. The final result of the\nelection is not expected to be announced for another 3 weeks. The current Afghan Parliament is\nstacked full of former warlords and power brokers\nwith ties to the old elite of Afghanistan. However,\ndespite widespread corruption and patronage networks in the Wolesi Jirga, it has managed to act as\nan effective check on the President Karzai.\nAfghanistan\nor housing benefits, which should be means\ntested. The distinction is rather subtle and may,\nadmittedly, require certain assumptions about\nthe homogeneity and expectations of society,\nas well as assuming that taxation and other\ngovernment spending follows fixed ideologies\neffectively.\nThe government still appears to be in two\nminds over universal welfare; this could well\nbe to spread the blow over subsequent budgets.\nWe will have to wait and see if they come to a\ndecision on its future by 2015.\nTyphoon Megi has left 200,000 people homeless\nand at least 11 dead in the Phillipines after making\nlandfall on Monday. Typhoon Megi battered the\nisland of Luzon with winds of up to 250 km/h\nthis week leaving a trail of destruction in its\nwake. Typhoon Megi is now thought to be heading\ntowards mainland China and Chinese officials\nhave evacuated tens of thousands of people from\nGuangdong and Hainan provinces in anticipation\nof Typhoon Megi. Meanwhile, Filipino President\nAquino praised\nhis administration\nfor the response\nto Typhoon\nMegi whose\npreparations\nhelped minimise\nthe loss of life.\nVenezuela\nPresident Obama has reaffirmed Venezuela\u2019s right\nto Russian nuclear aid at a meeting with journalist in\nthe White House. President Obama added that Venezuela must behave responsibly and honour her obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nThis comes after Venezuela signed a deal with Russia who agreed to build two 1.2 GW reactors during\na state visit by President Hugo Chavez to Moscow\nlast week. President Obama hopes to improve USVenezuelan ties which have improved following the\nelection of President Obama.\nGeorge Osborne has promised to peel, cut and mash the deficit.

    "content": "18\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 22 OCTOBER 2010\nT\nhe Browne Review aims\nto advise the Government\non changes to the system\nof Higher Education Funding. Although the headline\nproposal has been to allow universities\nto set their own fees, the proposals in\nthe review would, if enacted, mean that\nanyone could go to university regardless\nof wealth. It would provide more money\nfor students to live on whilst at universi-ty. It would also mean that no one would\nhave to start paying off their loan until\nthey were earning \u00a321,000, and that until then, there would be no interest on it.\nWhy are the NUS against these propos-als? For one reason: perception.\nThe NUS have to be seen to be justifying themselves, and so have picked up\non the fact that universities could charge\nunlimited fees to say that students could\nbe priced out. Under the proposals, Imperial could charge whatever it wants,\nbut if the Government pays this for you\nup front, if you only pay it back when\nyou\u2019re earning, and if the debt is wiped\nafter 30 years, is there really an issue?\nBy saying that students will be priced\nout, the NUS is doing more damage to\nthe expectations of school children looking to apply to university than any rise in\nfees. By focusing on this, and ignoring\nthe benefits of what Browne proposes,\nthey have shown they are more willing\nto follow ideological points than engage\nwith the problem.\nAnd the problem is that universities\nare underfunded; university funding per\nstudent has dropped with increased participation over the last two decades. universities need more money to enhance\nteaching, invest in new facilities, fund\nresearch (and it is research-led-teaching\nthat makes universities so excellent) and\nincrease bursaries for poorer students.\nImperial, like other universities, has an\nextensive bursary scheme to help students with living costs. 40% of Imperial\nstudents receive some kind of payment\nfrom the College. And Imperial want to\nprovide more help with living, and reduce fees for all but the most wealthy.\nIn fact, they\u2019re doing it; building up the\nendowment so that students get a fairer\ndeal.\nIt begs the question; what all the fuss\nis about? Sciences are more expensive\nto teach and fees may be higher than for\nArts subjects. But the potential earnings\nare also greater, and for those of us who\nwant to go into low paying jobs such as\nteaching or research, Browne proposes\nmore help for universities which provide the graduates which choose these\npaths. Crucially for us, the new \u00a321,000\nthreshold means that if you do a PhD,\nyou are very unlikely to have to start\npaying off your undergraduate loan until\nyou finish.\nWe are at a university which aims to\nensure that students can come here regardless of their ability to pay. But it is\nThe Review is right\nnot just out of kindness; it is in every\nuniversity\u2019s best interest to attract the\nbrightest students, regardless of their\nability to pay. They can only do this if\nthey have the money to do so. The other\nsource of money is the Government. I\nhear the economic argument for free\neducation, that it benefits the economy\nto have highly skilled graduates, so let\nthe Government pay... but doesn\u2019t that\nsound selfish? After all, graduates benefit more individually than non-gradu-ates. Are we really attending university\nout of self-sacrifice for the rest of the\neconomy? I would feel embarrassed\nsaying to someone who didn\u2019t have the\nacademic background, inclination or circumstances to go to university, that we\nhelp the country more than them, so deserve their tax money. We need to start\ntaking responsibility for our education.\nPaying for it is a start.\nWe should support the Browne Review, and all attempts to get universities\nthe money they need, whilst keeping\nin mind that access for all is a worthier\ngoal than free education.\nWe should accept the Browne Review \u2013 it is only fair that\nstudents should pay for the benefits of their education\nBy the time that George Osborne stood to\ndeliver the Spending Review at the Dispatch\nBox in the House of Commons, scientists\nat Imperial and around the UK had already\nbreathed a sigh of relief. Although funding\nis still being cut by 10%, U.K. research has\nescaped the catastrophic 25% cuts that had\nbeen threatened. But we at Imperial, in our\nivory towers in South Kensington, should not\nforget that other subjects and other universities are being hit hard; we are the lucky\nones.\nScientific research is being spared (in this\nperverse world, a 10% cut is salvation) because the government has recognised, as\nwell they should, that cutting investment in\nresearch is like shooting yourself in the foot.\nIt does more to damage economic recovery\nthan to promote it. However our investment\nin R&D is still far behind our global competi-tors. For what can only reasons of political\nexpediency (because it defies all logic) we\nare cutting at a time when other developed\ncountries are boosting research funding. Imperial\u2019s global reputation, solid financial position and willingness to take hard-nosed decisions (see the Life Sciences re-structure)\nwill mean that it will retain its position as a\nglobally-competitive research institution. But\nbe in no doubt, research in the UK in general\nwill suffer heavily as a result of the government\u2019s plans.\nIn teaching also, we should consider ourselves blessed. The government has set out\na massive contraction in university funding.\nHumanities and other non-STEM (Science,\nTechnology, Engineering and Medicine) subjects will struggle with the coalition\u2019s 79%\ncuts. Imperial is one of the few universities\nthat will be able to shake off this attack with\nrelatively few scars. Our international reputation means that we will always be able to\nattract international students who boost universities\u2019 coffers with the high fees that they\npay. In addition we will be able to charge\nhigher home fees if the cap on tuition fees is\nlifted which, again, will help to offset losses\nfrom government funding. Imperial, which rejects the majority of its applicants already,\nwill not need to worry about deterring home\nstudents with higher fees. Finally, the fact\nthat we are a STEM institution means that\nthe losses in government funding will be\nsmall in comparison to other institutions.\nBut although you will not experience the\nfull impact of the Government\u2019s cuts, don\u2019t\nlet that fool you supposing that they are\ninsignificant.\nFELIX\nAlex Kendall\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nThe Government\u2019s\nSpending Cuts won\u2019t hit us\nas hard as others\nImperial College has an extensive bursary scheme to improve access for students\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPresident, Imperial\nCollege Student\u2019s Union\n\u201cAre we really\nattending university\nout of self-sacrifice?\u201d\n\u201c\n\u201c\nscheme to improv\n\u201d\nof kindness; it is in every\nf kindness; it is in\nThe NUS have shown they\nare more willing to follow\nideological points than engage\nwith the problem.\nC omment Editor: Anna Perman\n\n"

The city has recently been identified as the US\u2019s unhealthiest by\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nJamie sets out to work with the school kitchens and the community to help people eat bet-ter. A highly noble pursuit. Yet from the off he\nis persistently confronted by incredulous cooks\nand administrators, who react venomously\nto the Essex boy telling them what they do is\nwrong. One cook gets all ruffled when he calls\nher a lunch lady. And yet all she does is to portray that stereotype perfectly by resisting any\npositive change to her hijacked work routine.\nShe goes on to state that she does her job only\nfor the money, and fails to see what\u2019s wrong\nwith serving poor, bland food \u2013 a problem that\ntragically afflicts all too many a canteen.\nThe local radio show host shows an equally\nnarrow-minded attitude, hollering \u201cwe don\u2019t\nwant to sit around and eat lettuce all day!\u201d The\nchef dryly states that he \u201cthought there were\nonly miserable bastards like that in England.\u201d\nFortunately, the US social inclination to avoid\nembarrassment at all costs soon kicks in and\nthe community gradually responds to Jamie\u2019s\npleas. He obtains tens of thousands of dollars\nfrom the local hospital boss to keep the scheme\ngoing, the school food supplier pledges a year\u2019s\nfree produce, and a thousand people partake in\nhis cookathon \u2013 including the Governor \u2013 discovering in the process how easy good, healthy\nfood can be to make and prepare.\nThe show does of course suffer from all the\nusual reality TV drivel, X-factor style (but with\nfar fewer lights and dramatic music), though\nthis does make it exceptionally watchable. Crucially, the sight of seeing Jamie blubbing five\ntimes an episode like some sort of leaking tap\ndoes not detract from the key objective of highlighting how entrenched in society shoddy eating has become not only for children, but adults\ntoo. Whilst the X-factor places tears, Simon\nCowell\u2019s teeth, and Wagner before music, Jamie\u2019s food revolution manages to consistently\nkeep good, honest food as its central heroine.\nJamie has spent the last few years changing\nthe way we perceive food.

This Middle Eastern delight\nhas a certain je ne sais quoi about it that undeniably puts you in a \u2018FREE HUGS\u2019 sort of\nmood.\nIt just so happens that there\u2019s a bit of science\nbehind this: hummus is pretty much the new\nProzac. Chickpeas are high in tryptophan, an\namino acid which is a vital building block of\nthe neurotransmitter serotonin (aka 5-hydroxy-tryptamine). Modern biochemistry and psychiatry show a strong correlation between lack of\nserotonin and mood disorders such as anxiety\nand depression. Nowadays, the lack of serotonin is treated with SSRIs (Selective Serotonin\nReuptake Inhibitors), all the big names in the\nanti-depressant market like Prozac, Seroxat and\nCipralex which work by increasing the amount\nof serotonin in the brain. A tryptophan-rich diet\nhas a similar effect, and quelle surprise! \u2013 the\nchickpea species has the highest tryptophan\ncontent of its genus. Nutritionally, hummus is\nalso a bit of a diamond. It\u2019s full of fatty acids\nlike Omega-3, lots of important minerals and\nis high in protein and complex carbohydrates.\nPlus the Glycemic Index of hummus is really\nlow so it keeps you fuller for longer.\nIf you\u2019ve not tried home-made hummus be-fore, I guarantee it will change your life. I found\na delightful little statistic claiming the average\nIsraeli eats 10kg of hummus a year \u2013 impres-sive, sure, but I hope to beat that. Now I know\nthe whole hummus process below looks pretty\narduous but you\u2019re actually looking at about\nmax. 20 minutes work, mainly changing the waJamie\u2019s US mission comes to a close\nter a couple of times and playing with a blender.\nYou will need\n- 1 cup of dried chickpeas (never, ever use\ntinned chickpeas \u2013 they are completely devastating in terms of the flavour and nutritional\nvalue of your hummus \u2013 and make sure you\nbuy the smallest dried ones you can find, I recommend any of the many grocers\u2019 on North\nEnd Road, the type you want is called \u2018desi\u2019)\n- 1/2 cup tahini (this is sesame seed paste)\n- the juice of 1 squeezed lemon\n- 1 or 2 garlic cloves (depending on your personal taste)\n- 1/2 teaspoon cumin\n- 1 tablespoon + 1/8 teaspoon baking soda (if\nyou don\u2019t use this your chickpeas will never\nsoften)\n- salt\nNow let\u2019s make some hummus!\n1 \u2013 Wash the dried chickpeas until the water\nruns clear. Soak overnight in clean water with a\ntablespoon of baking soda. The following day\nwash them and soak again in fresh water for\na couple more hours. At this point the grains\nshould have absorbed most of the water and\ndoubled in volume.\n2 \u2013 Wash the chickpeas thoroughly and place\nin a large saucepan. Cover with water, add\nan 1/8 of a teaspoon of baking soda and NO\nsalt. Simmer for an hour or so, and switch the\nwater half-way through cooking. Remove the\npeels and foam which float to the surface. Your\nchickpeas should now be very easily smushed\nbetween two fingers. Sieve the grains and reserve the cooking water.\n3 \u2013 Put the chickpeas into a food processor and\nwhiz them up. Leave them to chill in the fridge.\n4 \u2013 Add the remaining ingredients and whiz\nagain until you get the desired texture. If it\u2019s\nlooking a bit too thick, add some of the cooking water. Voila! Perfect hummus. I serve\nmine with a drizzle of good olive oil and some\nchopped parsley. Viva la hummus revolution!\nFlickr/caitysparkles\nCharles Betts\n\n"

Making\nup the competition with ourselves and the hosts\nwere Cambridge Parnells, Oxford Brooks and\nZurich, the latter laden with plenty of ringers\nfrom back home, so we had four 10 minute-a-half games.\nCambridge 2-1 Imperial 0-3*\nOur first match was against our hurling rivals\nCambridge. Straight from the throw-in, Captain\nFinzo gained possession and fired over a point,\nonly for it to be waved wide. Cambridge then\ntook advantage of this and managed to knock a\ncheap goal past Frankie \u201cDonal Og Cusack\u201d O\nNeill. However, some resolute defending from\nNeil Clancy, Chris Farrell and Paddy Comerford, and points from Ballyfinn man Evin\nCoogan and Finian McCann left the half-time\nscore 1-0 to 0-2. Despite dominating most of\nthe possession in the second half too, Imperial\u2019s\nlack of accuracy was to be their downfall. Cambridge finished off the game in style with a well-taken goal, while Imperial could only manage\nanother point (and some dubious \u201cwides\u201d).\nImperial 1-11 Oxford 0-1\nJarred by the ignominy of our previous de-feat, we were determined that there would\nnot be an Oxbridge double over us, hence the\nenactment of Darwinian justice upon a shell-shocked Oxford side. After only three minutes\nof play Imperial were already three points up,\nwith a point kicked over by McCann and some\nvery well-taken chances by Ev Coogan, now\nplaying up front after advice over the phone\nfrom Brian Cody. Ed O\u2019Hare, now in midfield,\nput the Oxford players under unrelenting pres-sure, forcing a lot of mistakes as Sean Dunne\nand John McGuckin rang rings around their\nmarkers. Eventually the ball spilled to Coogan\nten yards from the net whereupon he made\nno mistake in drilling it past the keeper. The\nsecond half was much the same: while Oxford\neventually converted their solitary score of the\ngame, Coogan, McCann and centre-back Clancy, displaying his versatility, recorded scores,\nleaving Imperial the clear victors at the final\nwhistle.\nImperial 0-7 Lakenheath 0-0\nNot much to be said about this game, other\nthan the level of hurling was as if a crowd of\nblind retarded gorillas picked up sticks. Despite\nthe instruction at half-time to euthanize the op-position, Imperial decided that energy was to\nbe saved for their final match and so we cruised\nto victory rather than steam-roll.\nZurich 2-2 Imperial 0-1\nDespite of the scoreline, this was by far the\nmostly keenly contested match of the day.\nSome Trojan defending by Neil Clancy et al\nmade sure that at half-time Imperial were a\npoint up against clearly the most talented team\nin the competition, with a free converted by\nEvin Coogan. The second half saw some tough\nhurling, with hard shoulders delivered and\nplenty of ash clashed. Unfortunately, in keeping with the Trojan analogy, Zurich managed\nto sneak over a brace of points and dispatch\ntwo balls past Sean Dunne (who had pulled off\nsome super saves in the first half) as Imperial\nbegan to show the strain.\nSo all in all two lost, two won, and a very\nencouraging display from all players involved\n(including Eddie Fitzpatrick who I now see I\nhaven\u2019t mentioned in the reports). A fine stew\nwas put on in the Earl of Darby in Cambridge\nand much ale imbibed, bringing a very enjoyable tournament to a close. The hurlers\u2019 next\noutings will be the Southern Region blitz on\nNovember 7th and the British Unis Championship on November 20th. Let me (finian.mc-cann07@imperial.ac.uk) know if you\u2019re avail-able.\nFinian McCann\nGaelic Sports: Imperial\nhurlers at Hurlapalooza\nImperial overcame a bullish Chichester side\nintent on winning their first home match of the\nseason.\nThe opening exchanges saw Chichester with\nthe lions share of possession using their heavy\npack to bully Imperial around the fringes and\nwere rewarded with a multitude of penalties but\nshowed very little attacking endeavour. Conversely, Imperial took the chances which they\nwere presented with; following a secured ball\noff a line out within the opposition 22, the forwards drove Chichester back allowing Simon\nFenton to bundle over the try line adding to an\nearlier penalty by Max Joachim. Despite this,\nImperial trailed their opponents 9-8 at the turn\naround knowing that their play during the first\nhalf left much to be desired.\nImperial picked up the tempo in the second\nhalf with Ben Adubi finishing off a scintillating\nteam move with multiple offloads keeping the\nball alive; breaks by Tom Stone and Chris McGeough were followed by a deft back handed\npass from Ollie Cox which opened up the blind\nside. Joachim and Toby Spittle combined well\nbefore an inside ball allowed Adubi to charge\nover. Chichester hit back using their \u2018bosh\u2019\ngame to good effect assuming a 16-13 lead.\nImperial refused to lie down and accept a defeat\nagainst less skilled albeit bigger opposition and\nso, Adubi grabbed his second try of the match\ncutting a lovely line off David Bowe\u2019s pass and\nevading a host of Chichester defenders with\nNick Johnstone adding the extras.\nDespite being reduced to 14 men on two occasions Imperial held out for the win. Although\nan away victory against difficult opposition was\na good result for Imperial, they know that their\nperformance on Wednesday was below what\nthey can produce and will need to Improve for\nnext weeks trip to Kent.\n53 ICSM Football M1 0 0 0\n54 Football M2 1 0 0 1 1 4 -3 -4\n55 ICSM Hockey W1 0 0 0 3 3\n56 Netball W3 1 0 0 1 18 22 -4 -4\n57 Football W1 0 0 6 5\n58 Hockey W2 1 0 0 1 0 6 -6 -4\n59 Fencing M3 0 0 118 126 8\n60 Tennis M2 1 0 0 1 0 10 -10 -4\n61 ICSM Hockey W2 0 0 0 13 13\n62 ICSM Netball W2 1 0 0 1 22 45 -23 -4\n63 ICSM Netball W3 0 0 9 33\n64 ICSM Rugby M2 1 0 0 1 10 86 -76 -4\n\n"

However, even as young adults we\u2019re still\nencountering that same gut-wrenching,\nsoul-destroying, back-breaking-nearly-paralysing feeling of sheer disappointment when we find out that the world is\nactually painfully boring.\nNothing exemplifies one of these moments for me more than the day I found\nout what the \u2018shadow cabinet\u2019 actually\nis, or more importantly what it is not. If,\nlike me, you always assumed that \u2018the\nshadow cabinet\u2019 was some sort of secret governmental squad of ninjas, who\ncarry out backdoor operations, such as\nassassination and torture, which seriously breech Geneva Conventions and\nhumanitarian legislations, but provide\nthe government with plausible deniability \u2013 then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to be\nsorely disappointed.\nThe House of Commons is split into\ntwo sides: The side with real jobs and\nthe side with imaginary jobs, and the latter is more formally known as \u2018the Shadow Cabinet\u2019. Because they only have\nimaginary jobs, they can\u2019t really do anything except sit there and disagree with\neverything. And there\u2019s not even one\nninja! Is it too much to ask to have one\nlittle ninja sitting behind David Cameron and occasionally nunchucking him\nin the back of the head? British politics\nhas taken a serious downfall since the\nabolition of ninjas in parliament. This is\nnow the point where I rest my chin on\nmy fist and gaze contemplatively out the\nwindow, imagining what MY \u2018shadow\ncabinet\u2019 would be like.\nHangman\u2019s Shadow Cabinet\n\u201cMwuhahahahahahaha!\u201d laughs Hangman in a somewhat clich\u00e9d fashion, as\nhe twiddles his moustache and sips tea\nfrom his impractically small teacup. He\nsits in his dark evil leather arm chair\nfacing away from the rest of his shadow\ncabinet in preparation for a dramatic\nturn (The evil leather arm-chair is on\nwheels). He hopes to unsettle some of\nthe more timid shadow ministers in his\ncabinet.\n\u201cSo Hangman, your evilness, what are\nwe going to about the Prime minister?\nHe\u2019s taken all the gold and he\u2019s giving\nTwatter\nhangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ne\nThe_OsBORNE_SUPREMACY\nDavid, isn\u2019t it a bit risky saying\nsomething like that on here?\nYou\u2019re the Prime Minister ffs\nit to the poor people\u2019\u2019 (THIS IS MY\nIMAGINATION, AND WE\u2019RE GOING TO PLAY IT OUT MY WAY!)\nqueried the shadow chancellor, Herman\nDefunkd.\nHangman sat and thought about this\nquestion, whilst puffing on a vintage\nCuban (an evil vintage Cuban).\n\u201cHangman?\u2019\u2019 asked Herman again, as\nHangman had not responded. This was\ndeliberate. Hangman wanted his dramatic turn to be all the more dramatic, so\nhe just continued to puff on his vintage\nCuban (his evil vintage Cuban).\n\u201cOh I know exactly what we\u2019re going\nto do\u2019\u2019 said Hangman, really slowly, and\nthen swooped round suddenly to face his\ndelegates. None of them flinched. Not\neven the more timid ones.\n\u201cWhat the fuck!?\u2019\u2019 exclaims Hangman, \u201cWhy did none of you jump? I\nturned around really quickly.\u2019\u2019\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really that scary\u2019\u2019 said\nGreg Cranford, Shadow secretary of\nEducation.\n\u201cWhat, really?

One moment I was facing that way,\nthen suddenly I\u2019m facing this...\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we know what you were going\nfor, it just, well, you were a bit clanky\nwith the turn\u2019\u2019 said Herman Defunkd.\n\u201cClanky?\u2019\u2019\n\u201cYeah, sort of clanky.\u2019\u2019\n\u201cWhat do you mean clanky?\u2019\u2019\n\u201cYou know, clanky \u2013 sort of like, not\nsmooth \u2013 clanky.\u2019\u2019\n\u201cLinda, was I clanky?\u2019\u2019\nLinda shuffled her papers nervously\nand kept her eyes fixated on the desk,\n\u201cYou were a tiny bit clanky\u2019\u2019 she\nmumbles.\n\u201cRight well, I guess we had better get\non to the more important issue at hand \u2013\nthe poor people\u2019\u2019 Hangman regains his\nevil composure and frowns deviously. It\nsort of looks more angry/concerned than\nevil, but in all fairness he\u2019s still a bit\npissed off at being told that his dramatic\nturn was clanky.\n\u201cThe Prime minister is giving all\nthe gold to the poor people\u2019\u2019 continues\nHerman, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something!\nSoon we\u2019re going to run out of gold!\u2019\u2019\n(I HAVE A VERY TENUOUS GRASP\nOF HOW THE ECONOMY WORKS).\n\u201cWe must do something decidedly\nevil!\u2019\u2019 says Hangman, evilly.\n\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u2019\u2019 asks\nLinda.\n\u201cWe should tell the Prime minister\nthat he shout NOT give gold to the poor\npeople!

I can sort of see where you\u2019re\ncoming from\u2019\u2019 says Herman, \u2018\u2019but per-haps, you know, we should offer an even\nmore evil alternative?\u2019\u2019\n\u201cNo Herman, you know what? You\nshould go fuck yourself!\u2019\u2019\n\u201cWhat? Hangman I was just trying\nto...\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always just like, being a dick\nto me and stuff\u2019\u2019 Hangman quickly turns\nto look back out the window, not in a\nvain attempt to look dramatic again, but\nto conceal the fact that he is welling up\nwith tears.\n\u201cHangman, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not trying\nto be a dick...\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Not Clanky!

    "content": "FELIX Friday 22 October 2010\nTRAVEL\nWonderful wildlife, treacherous trekking and a\nmonstrous mountain. By Chris Richardson\nMy Northern Borneo Jamboree\nI am a huge fan of mainland Malaysia,\nwhat with its plethora of creole cuisines\nand party people, but its true face lies\non Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. As soon\nas I landed in Kota Kinabalu and hit the\nstreets, I realised I was onto something\ngrand: the sun was smouldering, the\nprices cheap, and all of the locals greeted me with a friendly smile.\nKK is the perfect central hub for any\nexplorer of Borneo. I spent a few days\nspotting some of the awesome underwater colours on offer at the world class\ndive spots located in the national park\njust off the shores of the city, largely to\nget over the pains of the Thailand binges that left my skin and liver in tatters.\nThe city itself is pretty hip, with one of\nthe highlights being the night markets\nselling the usual arty crafts and mad\nvariations of various Asian cuisines. If\nyou have yet to be acquainted with the\ndelight that is cendol, I\u2019d highly recommend it: a bizarre icy mix of coconut\nmilk, food-coloured jelly, beans, rice\nand creamed corn that somehow seems\nto get your taste buds dancing.\nAs with any city, you have the option of superior hotels, but I opted for\nthe grungy backpackers\u2019 hostel so that I\ncould be kept in the company of fellow\ntravellers, in the hope that I\u2019d persuade\nat least one to venture up Mount Kinabalu (Southeast Asia\u2019s highest) with me.\nA few beers and a curry later and it\nwas happening, and at seven o\u2019clock\nthe following morning myself and my\nnewly-found Dutch partner in crime\nwere on our way to the said mountain.\nNeedless to say I think we underestimated it: I spent the better part of \u00a310\non my \u2018equipment\u2019 which consisted of\na second-hand pair of women\u2019s trainers,\na pair of women\u2019s leggings (see a pattern here?), and a weather-beaten pon-cho. Armed to the teeth with a bottle of\nwater and boiled egg in hand, we began\nthe climb. I make it sound like \u2018mission\nimpossible\u2019, but really, if you\u2019re capable\nof making it to the silent study section\non the 5th floor of the library without using the lift, you can probably handle it.\nrise, and thanks to a seemingly-empty\npromise to a young lady back home I\nended up in a pair of girl\u2019s underwear,\nwhile well wrapped-up climbers around\nme looked on in mild amusement. At\nleast a few of them took photos \u2013 here\u2019s\nhoping I\u2019m on a cereal box somewhere.\nThe logic behind doing the mountain\nfirst was to get the hard part out of the\nway, which in retrospect was a terrible\ndecision. Instead I spent the subsequent\nfour days with knobbly knees and achy\njoints that made the abundance of rainforest trekking a bit of a nightmare. We\ndid a brief stopover to the hot springs\nat the base of the mountain, famous\nfor its sulphuric minerals that allegedly\ncure aching muscles \u2013 all utter bollocks\nand an obvious ploy to coax climbers\ninto spending more money post-climb.\nThere was the token trip to the Sepilok\nOrang-utan Rehabilitation Centre as\nan insurance policy to catch a glimpse\nof this beautiful animal that regrettably\nmight not be with us for much longer.\nOf course it\u2019s easy to criticise the deforestation through bigoted Western eyes,\nbut you have to wonder why this kind\nof thing goes on \u2013 palm oil plantations\ncould be the region\u2019s best hope for a spot\nin global trade as well as a method of\nensuring wealth for future generations.\nThe late Uncle Tan was once the region\u2019s leading explorer and thankfully\nhis relatives are continuing his brilliant work by offering jungle treks as\nwell as cruises along the ecologically\ndiverse Kinabatangan River. Had I departed with a checklist of things to see\nI\u2019d have filled in the lot: countless species of monkeys, vivid kingfishers, wild\ncats, giant bats, and the Holy Grail \u2013 a\nwild female orang-utan clutching her\nnewborn child. It\u2019s just incredible when\nthe odds are on your side and you get to\nwitness such awesomeness; while oth-cial moments should really be kept as\nmental images; the pixels on the camera\nand my lousy words on this page really\ndo the sight no justice whatsoever.\nAnd sadly that\u2019s where that little\nchapter had to draw to a close as Hong\nKong beckoned; I\u2019ll definitely be delving even further into Borneo next time\nto check out the Indonesian areas which\nsupposedly offer some great caving. All\nin all, a fantastic leg of my 2010 \u2018Asian\nInvasion\u2019. Sabah is definitely a place\nthat should be on more people\u2019s hit\nlists \u2013 with such amazing scenery and\na whole heap of activities at affordable\nprices, what\u2019s not to love? Hop out of\nthe Benidorm and into the Borneo; go\nand soak up the rainforest and its wonderful biodiversity while you\u2019ve still got\nthe chance.\n\u201cPalm oil plantations\ncould sadly be the\nregion\u2019s greatest\nhope of ensuring\nthe wealth of future\ngenerations.\u201d\nSporting some beautiful lingerie at the highest point in Southeast Asia Thanks to our reckless actions orang-utans are being forced from the rainforest\nAdmiring the setting sun over the national park in Kota Kinabalu\n\u201cSabah is definitely\na place that should\nbe on more people\u2019s\nhit lists.\u201d\nIt\u2019s embarrassing enough that within\nthe first kilometre I was sweating like\nLee Evans on a bad day, but the real\ncherry on the cake was being out-paced\nby several women in their 70\u2019s, sporting\nbags bigger than their bodies filled with\nthe various things that climbers demand\nfor din-dins. I couldn\u2019t help but think\nthey should have been snuggled up under a blanket with a hot beverage by the\ntelly, but hey, they seemed to love the\nwork! After a dreadful first day up to the\n3.5km mark we retired to our cold shack\nand attempted to get some shut-eye,\nwhich failed thanks to the high altitude.\nBy day two I\u2019d lost the sole from one of\nmy cheap shoes but we ventured up to\nthe 4.2km high summit in time for sun-ers scrambled for their cameras (which\nfailed, by the way), I just watched in\namazement for those brief few seconds\nbefore the mother fled and bounded into\nthe distance.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 22 October 2010 3\nFollowing the publication of Lord\nBrowne\u2019s Report on the assessment\nof Higher Education Funding in the\nBrowne Review Sir Keith O\u2019Nions,\nRector of Imperial College London,\nhas expressed strong support in the\nproposal of lifting capping fees for\nUniversity tuition entirely. He rejected\na Graduate Tax as unworkable and\ndescribed Lord Browne\u2019s recommendations as \u201ccomprehensive and fair\u201d.\nAlthough various concerns are circulating the proposition of the uncap-ping of tuition fees, Sir Keith O\u2019Nions\nbelieves that such a change would not\nprove as detrimental as at first feared.\nAt a renowned University, consistently\nrated amongst the world\u2019s best, Sir Keith\nbelieves that students will not be deterred from applying despite a possible\nraise of tuition fees to more than \u00a37,000\nper year with an option of an additional\n\u00a33,000 to this. Sir Keith O\u2019Nions said\n\u201cWe expect fees to increase nationally,\nincluding at Imperial College London.\nFor admission to our courses in science,\nengineering and medicine, we will continue to search for and select the most\nacademically able, high quality students\nfrom across the world.\u201d The National\nUnion of Students (NUS), however,\nforesees graduates facing daunting financial pressures with \u201cmortgage-style\ndebts\u201d of more than \u00a340,000. Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions goes on to reassure that those\nin need of financial aid will be supported as best as the University can,\nmaking full use of all resources available to ensure all students that will benefit from courses at Imperial College\nLondon will still be attracted to apply.\nA major concern, however, is that\nas a university that only provides Science, Technology and Medicine courses\n(STEM), fees are expected to rise to a\ngreater magnitude compared to other academic institutes in Britain. This could\nresult in a hindrance causing the downfall of applications of prospective students to the University as a \u201cmarket\u201d is\neffectively created from which students\nmay consider not only academic reputation and university experience but also\nessentially what their degree is costing\nthem. This in turn could cause a knock-on effect creating a possible downfall\nof the reputation currently drawn from\nthe large number of high calibre appli-cants. Sir Keith is convinced, however,\nthat prospective students will be well informed about the educational experience\noffered here and the future employment\nopportunities that come with a degree\nfrom Imperial, \u201cWe will ask all who have\nbenefitted from the excellence of an Imperial education to help make it possible\nfor those who have yet to.\u201d An increased\nteaching grant for STEM subjects has\nalso been proposed to which Imperial\nCollege Union has described as a \u201csensible option\u201d since its essential and heavy\nlab based teaching is unable to be subsided through other less costly means.\nAt present the University is planning a long-term campaign that will\nprovide support focused on scholarships and financial aid at Imperial College. Sir Keith said, \u201cOur goal is to\nbuild the resilience of an endowment\nto give Imperial the sustainable basis\nto attract the brightest and the best in\nthe world, for generations to come.\u201d\nUnion and College back higher fees\nFiveSixEight opens\nA\nfter weeks of delays the\nUnion finally unveiled\nFiveSixEight, the newly\nrefurbished Union bar that, as one\nCollege source joked, \u201cis probably\nbetter than Eastside.\u201d\nThe old heavy wooden tables\nand benches have been done away\nwith and replaced with restaurant\nstyle seating to accompany the\nnew menu and lunchtime table\nservice. It remains to be seen\nwhether the new furniture will\nwithstand the drinking games of\nan inebriated rugby team.\nLunchtime has changed also.\nThe menu is more upmarket and\nfood is now made to order and\nbrought directly to your table.\nFeedback from students was\noverwhelmingly positive if not\nsomewhat reserved. The ever-un-Three weeks late but worth the wait\nOn the 14th of October, the Union set\nout their initial response to the Browne\nReview ahead of the Council debate on\nthe Union\u2019s Higher Education Policy\non the 1st of November. Overall the\nUnion\u2019s initial response was in fact\n\u2018broadly\u2019 in support of the suggested\nchanges. Despite the alarmingly high\nfigures the Browne review proposes,\nthe Union\u2019s comments offer some degree of consolation to students terrified\nby the idea of rising University fees.\nAlthough the overall cost of fees\ncould rise to around \u00a36000 per year,\nthe amount an average Imperial graduate would have to pay back per month\nwould actually be less than what it\ncurrently stands at. This of course still\nmeans that overall students will have to\npay back a considerably higher amount,\nbut the Union\u2019s response clearly states\nthat no one has to pay back this fee as\na lump sum. Also highlighted are the\nCollege\u2019s efforts to increase the bursary\nscheme that already exists to help support less well off students at Imperial.\nThe Union makes the point that \u201cthe\nBrowne review does nothing to provide incentives for businesses to invest in students\u2019 education\u201d, indicating\nthat some aspects of the review are not\nso popular. As a university with one\nof the highest employment rates after\ngraduation there is no reason why we\nshould not see an increase in the number of business bursaries, provided that\nthe correct incentives are provided.\nAnother point close to the heart of most\nImperial students that the Union makes\nis with regards to comments on STEM\nsubjects. These subjects have been identified as crucial as they tend to be the\nareas in the workplace where skills are\nmost lacking. Unfortunately these are\nalso the degrees that cost the most to run\nand often result in relatively low graduate starting salaries. As a result the government aims to ensure science graduates leave with similar levels of debt as\narts graduates. As Imperial is a science\nand technology institute it is no surprise\nthat the Union supports this proposal.\nWriting in Felix this week, Union President Alex Kendall supports a change\nin the way that universities are funded\nin order that students see an increased\nquality of education. Supporters of higher tuition fees often argue that students\nwould value their degrees more highly.\nWhat the real emphasis should be on is\nfair access to education based on a students\u2019 academic ability and an improved\nquality of education. The Union believes that the Browne Review\u2019s recommendations are the way to achieve this.\nZoe Groom\nThe Union\u2019s response Imperial\u2019s response\nRosalyn Flower\n\u201cCheers love, and can I also have a dirty pint, twelve shots of jaeger and a snog? Whahey! I\u2019m a LAD!!!\u201d\nderstated Imperial student body\noffered comments like \u201cTo be fair,\nit\u2019s not a bad effort\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s\ndefinitely less shit than before.\u201d\nWhich just goes to show that you\ncan\u2019t get the majority of Imperial\nstudents excited about anything.\nThe bar itself has been completely overhauled and given its\nlength, probably occupies different time zones. One student said\n\u201cIt\u2019s great, I didn\u2019t have to wait at\nall for a drink.\u201d The reduced queuing time has allowed the Union to\nsell more beer, bringing in a record\n\u00a315,000 on Wednesday night.\nMost students, whether enthusiastic about the bar or not, were\nsimply glad to have somewhere\ncheap to drink with their mates\nagain.\nKadhim Shubber\nAlex Kendall\u2019s view - Page 18\n\n"

There\u2019s\nalways a story to tell the\nnext day, but it\u2019s not every morning you wake\nup to find it all described in wavering\ndetail across the global press, from the\nBBC all the way over to The Los Angeles Times.\nMy name is James Fletcher and I\u2019m\na postgrad student in the department of\nAeronautics. I recently started here and\nnot long ago after a small reunion with-friends from Queen Mary, a couple of us\nheaded from the West End over towards\nKensington to check out the union bar at\nImperial. We were never to arrive that\nevening because on the way a prominent\nbut unfortunate American author was\nholding a party for the UK book launch\nof his most recent novel. The event was\nlit up like a neon sign just asking to be\ngatecrashed. We jumped out of the cab\nand headed towards the main entrance,\nignoring how inappropriate our attire\nwas for the event. The cocktails we\u2019d\nalready consumed in the Paddington\nHilton had taken care of any feelings of\nhesitation we may otherwise had. At the\ndoor, a bit of wavy-handed rhetoric was\nenough for the clipboard staff to let us\npass and, after pretending we were with\nPuffin Publishing and shouting some\ngreetings of false recognition to a group\nnearby, we were in.\nThe champagne came quicker than we\ncould drink it, accompanied by the hors\nd\u2019\u0153uvres, but it wasn\u2019t long before the\nchit chat with guests became a little fu-tile. The people there were by no means\nboring (those actually invited were the\ncr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the literati), but\nhaving to keep up lie after lie as to who\nwe were and what we were doing was\nbecoming progressively more inane. As\nthe speeches continued and our intoxication mounted we began to blow our own\ncover to an increasing crowd of people\nin there. The whole time, as I realised it\nwasn\u2019t long before we would soon leave\n(of our own accord or not), I increasingly felt the urge to do something amus-ing. The author, Jonathan Franzen had\nalready suffered while on tour in London. Problems from the tube strikes certainly compounded the issues he\u2019d had\nwith the UK publishers who had printed\nthe wrong version of his book. Surely\nhis visit couldn\u2019t get any worse. Perhaps this thought may have been crossing his mind, as we were at the bar tearing a blank page from a copy of his new\nbook \u2018Freedom\u2019 in preparation for the\nprank. I had thought several times from\nacross the room how much I admired\nthe frames he wore; so much so that I\nhad almost wished I wore glasses my-self. We scribbled a ransom note simply\nstating: \u201c$100,000 and your glasses are\nyours again\u201d with my e-mail address at\nthe bottom. At first I attempted to see\nif I could swipe them from behind the\ncurtain where he stood but there were no\ngaps at all. The direct approach was the\nonly option. After making arrangements\nwith my accomplice for the ransom note\nto be delivered to him, I strode quickly\ntowards where he stood with a group\nof his colleagues and shouted \u201cWe\u2019re\nwith Channel 4! Channel 4!\u201d. This was\na subterfuge that would buy me at least\n2 seconds, enough perhaps to stop him\nfrom arresting my attempts of capturing\nhis glasses, athough I\u2019m not totally sure\nwhat this meant exactly. The point is it\nseemed to work. Within seconds I was\nout the back entrance scaling a five-foot\nfence and running through Hyde Park.\nI called my friend whilst still making my escape, arranging a rendezvous\nwithout actually knowing what the hell\nwe were going to do next. Wait for\na response? Go and give the glasses\nback? It was only a prank after all, but\nonly minutes later I began to realise my\nfate was no longer entirely in my own\nhands. I twigged how many of his security team were in hot pursuit of me\nand these glasses. They seemed to appear in the park in all directions out of\nnowhere as though spawned from the\ndark, each jogging in good pace after\nme. I have to admit I quickly began to\nfeel The Fear. My merry state of inconsiderate mirth quickly dissipated, replaced only with acute apprehension and\nan increasing desperation to escape. I\nran in any direction I could, knowing I\ncould easily outsprint and outpace these\nmen if only I could find a clear enough\nroute out. I headed quickly towards\nthis route, jumping another fence, only\nto find I had trapped myself between\nthem and the Serpentine lake. I negotiated my way through sharp hedges and\ntrees trying to get far enough along the\nbank so that I could continue my way\nout of the park. Disturbing wildlife as\nI trudged my way through the lake, their\nscreeching noises gave away my position and voices from outside the fence\nbegan to close in on me. I ran towards\nthe lake trying to hold my blackberry\nabove my head to save it from being destroyed in the water, as I had at this point\ndecided I would swim to safety. Yes,\nthere was no way at all that this was a\nbad idea. Without any thought I dashed\nquickly into the water, foot deep, knee\ndeep and then finally almost up to my\nshoulders. The distance to the other side\nbegan to look further away with every\nstep I moved. My shoes began to sink\ninto the sludge at the bottom and I held\nonto a branch that protruded from a tree\non the bank and waited for some time,\ncontemplating how all this mess might\njust all sort itself out if I waited long\nenough. As I watched my copy of Freedom float away up the river, I envied it;\nwhilst hearing the voices shouting to me,\nassuring me that I\u2019d be caught and to\ngive myself up. Stubbornly I decided it\ncouldn\u2019t get any worse and held my hostage safe above the water planning how\nI might get away. The shouting dimin-ished, the heavy footsteps faded to distant background noise and I decided they\nmight have thought I had made it to the\nother side. I slowly crept up the bank,\ncutting myself on thorns and crawling\nthrough whatever gaps I could to minimise the noise of my exit. As I got closer\nto the fence I heard a man shout: \u201che\u2019s in\nhere!\u201d Using their loud noises of pursuit\nto drown out the sound of my own dash\nback down to the bank, I quickly ran out\nof sight and lay flat on the ground. A\ngame of chess where the fugitive had\njust lost all his pieces at once. I lay as\nstill as possible, hoping that I could be\nmistaken for more innocent animals that\nlived in the wooded area. No, police had\narrived now with torches. They were\nnot close by though. After some time I\nbegan to realise I could have another attempt to make my way out when I heard\nthe sounds of helicopter blades getting\ncloser. This wasn\u2019t for me because they\ndon\u2019t send helicopters out for people\nthat take somebody\u2019s glasses, not even\na celebrity\u2019s... Do they? I lay even stiller\nas it dawned on me; I knew my escape\nwas impossible now. The chopper was\nfor me and the sound of the blades was\nas persistent as its intent to help in my\ninevitable arrest. Surely they knew this\nwas just a practical joke. How far had\nthis gone? More importantly, when were\nthe police dogs going to arrive and what\nwere they going to do? I clasped the\nglasses in my hand (my only bargaining\nchip) and tried to make my way back\nto the river where they might not track\nme. Torch lights swung past me as I hid\nas low down as I could and officers of\nthe law got closer, at one stage walking\nstraight past me in the darkness of the\nbushes. I knew the game was nearly up,\nbut I have learned never to give up, always fight till the last man; so I stayed\nput, still as I could be. It took only five\nmore minutes, though, and my face reflected the beam of light from police\nconstable Garty\u2019s torch. I sighed with\nacceptance and maybe a little relief, reluctantly getting to my feet and offering\nmy hand to congratulate the officer on\nhis work, this denied I offered my other\nhand for the cuffs. The event organiser\nthen offered his opinion of me and I was\nput in the back of a van after handing\nover the glasses.\nStill drunk and jovial in character,\nI persuaded the Met to polish them up\nand for the arresting officer to personally hand the author his glasses back, to at\nleast reflect how good our law enforcement is over here, even if other parts of\nhis visit to London had been disgrace-ful. The police began to see the humour\nof it, as it appears did Franzen too. It\nwasn\u2019t long before I was released out of\ncustody from Belgravia Station without\nany further action. Perhaps in the spirit\nof the title of his book, he had granted\nme just that. I arrived back home, one\npair of shoes and one blackberry less,\nand used the internet to contact my\nfriends only to relive the whole experience as I watched the media frenzy begin to unfold online.\nIn case you were in any doubt, the answer to the question above is \u201cYes... yes he is\u201d\nSurely they knew this\nwas just a practical\njoke. How far had\nthis gone. More\nimportantly, when\nwere the police dogs\ngoing to arrive and\nwhat were they going\nto do?\u201d\n\u201c\nIS THIS IMPERIAL\u2019S\nBIGGEST BADASS?\nImperial student\nJames Fletcher made\nheadlines across\nthe globe when he\nstole famous author\nJonathan Franzen\u2019s\nglasses from his\nface. Now he retells\nhis incredible story\n\n"
