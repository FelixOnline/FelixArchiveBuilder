It houses everything from punk rock fashion to\nclassical sculpture, by the way of jewellery and tapestries, so there\u2019s\nsomething for all tastes. In addition to the permanent displays, free\nthemed exhibitions are staged regularly in the Porter Gallery. The\nV&A is the perfect place to go to sketch, explore or escape the rain.\nPlus the caf\u00e9 is pretty great.\nFree! Special exhibitions from \u00a39.\nNational Gallery...\nThis is truly the bastion of all visual art in London,and the country.You are guaranteed to\nsee Monets, van Goghs and da Vincis for free whenever you go, where else would that be\npossible? Just wandering around the galleries is a master course in art history, only there\nare so many galleries that it would be impossible to see it all in one visit. Whilst you\u2019re\nthere, make sure to check out the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square for a quick modern\nart fix.\nFree! Special exhibitions from \u00a38.\n...and National Portrait Gallery\nJust around the corner from the National Gallery, the NPG is the ultimate illustrated\nwho\u2019s who. It is home to the fantastic BP National Portrait Awards, and numerous well\nknown paintings, among them the controversial Duchess of Cambridge painting. The\nNPG is a must-visit for anyone who\u2019s interested in boundaries between celebrity and\nfine art.\nTickets from \u00a36 on Thursdays.\nTate Britain\nTate Britain is placed bang in the middle of the tourist heartland; minutes\nfrom Big Ben and the Palaces of Westminster, it is home to the Turner\nPrize. That\u2019s not all, The Tate Collective London which works with Tate\nBritain and Tate Modern run free events and festivals for students. On the\nfirst Friday of October, November and December there will be workshops,\ntalks, live performance, even a DJ as part of Late at Tate Britain.\nFree! Special exhibitions typically from \u00a314.\nNational Theatre\nOne of the great arts institutions in the country, the National\nTheatre is at the forefront of British theatre. A major collaborator\nboth internationally and at home, the NT is an essential component\nof the UK\u2019s arts scene with its shows frequently transferring to the\nWest End and beyond. Although the NT isn\u2019t the biggest risk taker,\nits shows are always accessible and of a consistently high quality.\nTickets from \u00a35 with NT Entry Pass.\nThe Young Vic\nConsistently brilliant and constantly pushing the boundaries of\nmodern theatre, the Young Vic showcases the best of the best on the\nBritish stage. Having stolen the show at the 2015 Olivier\u2019s, the YV\nunsurprisingly approaches the New Year with sky high expectations.\nWith two shows transferring to New York after a sell-out season in\nLondon, the YV might be one of London\u2019s smaller venues, but they\ncarry a big punch.\nTickets from \u00a310 for students and under 25s.\nThe Comedy Tree\nHaving recently relocated from Putney to Hammersmith, the\nComedy Tree starts a new season of Thursday night stand-up.\nDespite not being a particularly well known venue, the CT has\nwelcomed a number of big names including Milton Jones and\nReginald D. Hunter. While I doubt it lives up to London\u2019s more\nfamous comedy clubs, the bar is open until 1am and the tickets are\nsurprisingly cheap. Who can complain?\nTickets from \u00a36 for students.\nBarbican\nA world class arts organisation with a stellar reputation for\ninnovation and learning, the Barbican covers all areas of the arts\nwith one of the greatest purpose built venues in London. Home of\nthe London Symphony Orchestra and Cumberbatch\u2019s Hamlet, the\nBarbican represents the best of the best in British creativity.\nTickets from \u00a35 with Young Barbican.\nTate Modern\nOne of the best collections of contemporary art in London,\nand part of the Tate Collective London, there\u2019s plenty of\nopportunity to enjoy the art and get involved more actively.\nFree! Special exhibitions typically from \u00a310.\n\n"

Gross to read, but grosser\nto have.\nLook, it might be nothing, but\nyou could just get a free STI test to\nput your mind at ease. It might be\nsomething else, like a urinary tract\ninfection, which you\u2019d want to get\nsorted anyway.\nYou know when something\u2019s\nchanged down there, so if all is not\nquite how it should be, best get it\nsorted.\nBut getting an\nSTI test is such a\nmassive effort.\nYou can book an STI test at\nImperial\u2019s own health centre in\nPrince\u2019s Gardens or there are\nwalk-in clinics all over London if\nyou\u2019re worried about bumping into\nsomeone you know.\nTests for Chlamydia and\nGonorrhoea for lads just involve\npissing in a cup. You can do that,\ncan\u2019t you?\nLadies, there is a little swabbing\ninvolved, but you can usually do it\nyourself,and it\u2019s nothing particularly\nout of the ordinary.\nBut I feel fine!\nLoads of stuff can be symptomless.\nIf you\u2019re at it all the time, we advise\ngetting checked every three months,\nor between sexual partners.\nLook, sleep with who you will;\nwe\u2019re not about shaming, we\u2019re just\nabout safety.\nSome of this shit can make you\ninfertile, and although babies is\nexactly what we\u2019re all trying to\navoid right now, anything that has\nconsequences that dramatic has got\nto be pretty grim.\nLET\u2019S TALK ABOUT SEX (NO, SERIOUSLY, LET\u2019S TALK)\nIt was World Contraception Day last week, so we\nthought we\u2019d use that as an excuse to give you lot\nthe lowdown on sexual health. Plus it meant we\ngot to say sex a lot in the office (SEX) and share\ngross stories about our \u201cfriends from home\u201d.\nNo one\nremembers\nhow weird\nyou were\nin year\nnine, and\ndamn, your\nbedroom\u2019s\njust down\nthe hall!\nS\noyou\u2019reafresherembarking\non your first year away\nfrom the homestead. Your\nparents coming back early\ncan\u2019t stop you now. Halls feels like\na giant school trip; the bubbling\nsexual tension, lack of teachers\nafter dark and playful fights in the\ncommunal kitchen when you should\nbe working. Except now there are\nseveral hundred of you, no one\nremembers how weird you were in\nyear nine,and damn,your bedroom\u2019s\njust down the hall!\nAll this might lead to you\nbringing back your new bae for\nChristmas, but unless you\u2019re careful,\nyour first holiday home could bring\nsomething decidedly itchier.\nFELIX doesn\u2019t slut shame and\nwe\u2019re totally pro you enjoying your\nsexual awakening in between lab\nreports. However, if you\u2019re a novice\nin the contraception department,\nthat has got to change.\nLook at this lovely doctor from Imperial\u2019s Health Centre. She\u2019s not going to judge you. Photo Credit: Jody Kingzett\nYou might not be planning on\nshagging your way through freshers\u2019\nweek, but experience has taught\nmost of us that these things are\nmysterious, and if they happen, it\u2019s\noften when you least expect them.\nSo be prepared, rubber up and take\nnote.\nWhether your mum, slyly and\nwithout mention, packed you\na Costco bulk box of condoms\nwhen you left home, or you lost\nyour virginity at fourteen with an\nexchange student, we still think you\nmight discover something new in\nthis spread.\nYou know you\u2019re meant to use a\ncondom. We all know, but it cam be\na little more complex and confusing\nthan that.We\u2019re not trying to scare\nyou,but \u2018super gonorrhoea\u2019is a thing\nnow.\nMaybe you\u2019ll have loads of sex,but\nmaybe you won\u2019t and that\u2019s okay. At\nleast after this you\u2019ll be well armed\nwith contraceptive knowledge. All\nthis information works really well as\nstilted small talk at freshers\u2019 events.\nAt least it does for the medics.\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. Double\nbagging is not a thing. Contrary to\nGavin and Stacey\u2019s Smithy, using\ntwo condoms at once is not a way\nto give yourself double protection\nagainst STIs. You go to Imperial,\nand so probably know more about\nfriction than this ex-biologist. It\u2019s a\ngreat way to break them and make\nyourself even more vulnerable to\ndisease/pregnancy/embarrassment\nthat you thought double bagging\nwas a thing.\nOk this one surprised even us, but\naccording to the NHS you shouldn\u2019t\nbe using a condom for more than\nhalf an hour. So if you\u2019re getting it\non in anything nearing endurance,\nbest change it up part way through.\nBetter safe than sorry. This could\nact as a nice snack/phone checking\nbreak for your lover, which they will\nundoubtedly be grateful for. Again,\nit\u2019s a friction issue. Hurry up with\nthat super-condom your lot are\nworking on, Bill Gates, jeez.\nONE AT\nA TIME,\nGUYS\nTHE \u2018HALF\nAN HOUR\nRULE\u2019\nBEING ILL\nFUCKS UP\nTHE PILL\nLook, even if you\u2019re on the pill,\nhaving a stomach upset could nullify\nits effect.If you throw up within two\nhours of taking it, chances are you\u2019re\nprobably not going to have absorbed\nthose lovely hormones. The NHS\nrecommends you take another one\nstraight away and that then you\u2019ll\nbe okay. However, if diarrhoa or\nvomiting continue for longer than\n24 hours, you should assume that\nthe pill won\u2019t have worked. If you\nare going to have sex during this\nbout of what sounds like a pretty\nawful stomach bug, you\u2019d better use\na condom.\nI can\u2019t believe anyone thinks this\nis funny, or (god forbid) sexy, but\nlike, obviously don\u2019t rip open the\ncondom wrapper with your teeth.\nThe poor thing is no match for your\nsharp and beautifully maintained\nby modern dentistry knashers. Also\ndon\u2019t pin it to the noticeboard in\nyour room. It sounds ridiculous but\nbabies have definitely been born\nbecause of this. Maybe you were?\nNice subject for your first phonecall\nhome, that.\nRESPECT\nTHE\nRUBBER\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nHow much is all this\nsafe sex going to\ncost me?\nNothing! God bless the NHS.\nContraception is free in the UK,\nto everyone. Even if you\u2019re an\ninternational student, you are\nentitled to free contraception and\nsexual health checks.\nWe\u2019re not saying you can waltz\ninto Boots and nab a box of Durex\nwithout paying, but all methods\nof contraception are free once\nyou\u2019ve registered with a GP. The\ncontraceptive pill and everything.\nCondoms can be picked up at the\nStudent Union and the Imperial\nCollege Health Centre on Prince\u2019s\nGardens, FOR FREE. Don\u2019t be\nembarrassed, just walk in and ask.\nYou\u2019re a strong independent person\nwho requires some rubbers, well\ndone you, and if anyone in the\nwaiting room looks at you funny,\nthey\u2019re probably just jealous.\nIf you\u2019re really worried you could\nprobably just write it on a little note\nand hand in to the receptionist. But\ncome on now, we\u2019re all grown ups.\nCondoms are a\npain.\nDo they actually hurt? If you\ngenuinely think they\u2019re too small,\nthere\u2019s a site called TheyFit who\nmeasure your member and ship\nspecially made rubbers. They also\nhave a money back guarantee if\nyou\u2019re not happy.\nThere is literally NO EXCUSE.\nFELIX is certainly not judging\nyou for how you choose to get your\nkicks, but use a freaking condom.\nAll this talk of\ncondoms, are you\nlot sponsored by\nDurex? What are the\nalternatives?\nMuch to our editor\u2019s\ndisaapointment, we are not yet\nsponsored by Durex, but no,\ncondoms aren\u2019t the be all and end all\nof contraception. There are myriad\nother methods for ladies and gents\nto prevent pregnancy. The obvious\none is the pill.To get it you will have\nto see a doctor. They weigh you,\ncheck your blood pressure and ask\na few questions just to make sure it\nsuits you.Then they give you a three\nmonth prescription to see how you\nfair.\nAfter that you go back, and they\u2019ll\ngive you as many as you want. This\nbeing said, condoms are the only\nform of contraception that protect\nyou from STIs.\nWe\u2019re not\ntrying to scare\nyou, but \u2018super\ngonorrhoea\u2019 is\na thing now\nWe\u2019re not\nsaying you\ncan waltz\ninto Boots\nand nab a\nbox of Durex\nwithout\npaying\n24 hour pharmacy\nYou can buy condoms here\nat any time of day.\nZafash Pharmacy, Old\nBrompton Road, SW5 0EA\nJefferuss Sexual Health\nWalk In Centre\nRun by the NHS and here\nfor all your contraception/STI\ntesting needs\n0203 312 6626\nSt Mary\u2019s Hospital,\nPaddington, W2 1NY\nJohn Hunter Clinic for\nSexual Health\n0203 315 6699\nChelsea and Westminster\nHospital, SW10 9NH\nNon-emergency NHS\n111\nDean Street Express\nFully automated STI check\nups in Soho.

You\nall deserve a pat on the back for\ngetting into Imperial. You deserve a\nlittle sit down for moving all your\nstuff into halls.By the end of freshers\nweek, you\u2019ll need a beach holiday.\nBut for now, it\u2019s time to forget your\nA-Level results, unfollow all your\nschool friends on Facebook and\nthink of a new nickname.

You\u2019re welcome, friends.\nBut who am I to tell you how to\nwash your clothes?

    "content": "PAGE 28 SATURDAY 3rd\nOCTOBER 2015 felixonline.co.uk\nTHE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nRecommended:Things to see in London\nPhotograph 51 (Noel Coward Theatre, Until 21 November)\nIn recent decades, as the sexism in science has become more recognised, Rosalind Franklin has been increasingly\nbrought up as an example of an under-credited player in the all-important discovery of the structure of DNA.\nIn Anna Ziegler\u2019s new play, Nicole Kidman portrays the scientist\u2019s life and career in her return to the West End\nstage. Many critics have praised her precise performance in bringing out Franklin\u2019s ambition, dedication and\nintelligence.\nWildlife Photographer of the Year (Natural History Museum, 16 October \u2013 10 April)\nOne of the most important competitions in wildlife photography in the world, the winners and commended\npieces from the Wildlife Photography of the Year are exhibited yearly in the Natural History Museum. From\nintimate portraits to grand landscapes,the works on display tell compelling stories from the natural world around\nus in beautiful ways. With over one hundred images on display creating an immersive experience for the senses,\nthis is definitely not an exhibition to be missed by anyone interested in photography, art or nature.\nThe World Goes Pop (Tate Modern, Until 24 January)\nPop Art has become synonymous with western consumer culture, but its history as a global medium of protest\nhas been largely forgotten.The Tate\u2019s new exhibition explores the unseen side of Pop Art and its diverse cultural\nadaptations. From Latin America to Asia this exhibition delves into the rich history of this global phenomena\nand celebrates an art form whose subversive message is more relevant now than ever before.\nHamlet @ NT Live (Various Cinemas across London, From 15 October)\nWhether Cumberbatch\u2019s Hamlet is an exciting, fresh staging or not \u2013 and consensus seems to be that this\nproduction isn\u2019t hugely special \u2013 Hamlet is still the greatest play ever created. Though I firmly believe that\nCumberbatch is simply too old to play the great Dane, Ben is still a seasoned, powerful performer who I\u2019m sure\nwill go to great lengths to put his unique touch on Hamlet.Whether it\u2019s worth the several hundred pounds you\u2019d\npay to see it on stage is difficult to judge, but NT Live offers a well produced filming at a fraction of the price.\nNational Poetry Day Live (Royal Festival Hall, 8 October)\nThe theme for this year\u2019s National Poetry Day is \u201cLight\u201d, and in line with this Southbank Centre and The Poetry\nSociety have teamed up to organise an afternoon of events celebrating up-and-coming young poets and artists\npresenting their take on light and its manifestations. There will be poetry readings, workshops and installations,\nincluding performances by Karen McCarthy Woolf,John Hegley and many more.There will also be an installation\nby poetry light artist Robert Montgomery and opportunities to create your own light-inspired artwork.\nAi Weiwei (Royal Academy, Until 13 December)\nArguably more famous for his political dissidence than his art, Ai Weiei was put under house arrest and tortured\ndue to his vocal opposition of the Chinese government. The RA has given over many of its main galleries to\nshowcasing his work; this is a chance to judge the art on its own merits, and it does not disappoint. Filled with\npowerful political messages and humanity, Ai combines the remains of Ming and Han dynasty artefacts with his\nown minimalist constructions in a witty and moving re-imagination of Michel Duchamp\u2019s \u2018readymades\u2019.\n\n"

Photo Credit: Huffington Post\nI\nt has been a tumultuous year\nfor British politics. We had\na surprise majority appear\nafter the general election, the\nLabour leadership campaign played\nout exactly opposite to how people\nexpected, the Liberals have gone\nback to the \u201870s and we came within\na whisper of having the British Isles\ntrimmed at the neck.\nFor politicos like me, this is such\nstuff as dreams are made on, and yet\ntime and time again the data shows\nthat the younger the age bracket,the\nless people seem to care.This article\nis not one of statistics and figures\nthough, but of arguments against\npolitical apathy. The interested\nreader who wishes to add context\nmight be interested in The Hansard\nSociety\u2019s annual audit on the subject\nor any number of useful documents\nfrom the Commons Library or\nParliament websites.\nHere are a few common maladies\nthe younger voter may suffer from:\n\u201cVoting won\u2019t change anything.\u201d\nWhether a lazy excuse or a genuine\nbelief, it is false. It is clear that the\nact of voting decides the constituent\nparts of the government, which may\nradically change the direction the\ncountry is taken in. Whether we are\ntalking large individual issues, such\nas the Commons\u2019 2013 rejection of\nairstrikes in Syria (285-272,against),\nor multiple small related changes\nwhich follow a clear and distinct\ndirection from that of a hypothetical\nalternative administration, such as\nthe many alterations and reductions\nin the scope of legal aid we\u2019ve seen\nover the past five years, just because\nan individual\u2019s life isn\u2019t altered\ndrastically over the course of one\nparliament says nothing about the\nstate our country is left in.\n\u201cMy vote won\u2019t change anything\u201d\n(a slight refinement).\nIt is often said that absolute power\ncorrupts absolutely, and there\u2019s no\nquicker path to absolute power\nthan an electorate who think their\nvoices carry no weight. I don\u2019t know\nenough about the subject (and don\u2019t\nhave time to sufficiently educate\nmyself).This can be quite an earnest\nargument at times, stemming from\nan understanding of the majesty and\nimportance we should all attribute\nto our democratic system. However\nI believe that firstly we should allow\nour conscience to inform, at least\nin part, our vote, without worrying\nsolely about hard facts and figures,\nand secondly someone who realises\nthe importance of voting in an\ninformed manner should probably\ntake a look at their priorities and\nset a little time aside, they may even\nfind they find politics interesting!\nFurthermore we live in a democracy\n(and all of the problems that\nmay come with it) rather than a\ngeniocracy, so perhaps we should\nnot worry about our relative or\nassumed ignorance about politics.\nPlato\u2019s dialogue Protagoras, in\nwhich he recalls Socrates asking the\nsophist Protagoras why we consult\nonly shipbuilders about building\nships, only architects about house\ndesign etc. and yet all citizens about\nthe running of the state, is a far\nmore intelligent exposition on the\nsubject.\n\u201cThe voting system is flawed.\u201d\nYes it is, terribly terribly so (or\nyou may not think so), and yet\nto change it democratically we\ncan only work within the system\nby voting or applying pressure\nthrough other democratic means;\nsuch as petitioning the government\nor peaceful protests, all of which\nrequire far more political nonse and\nengagement than simply voting\nevery few years.\n\u201cNone of the parties represent me.\u201d\nThe usual responses to this are\nunreasonable even to me. They vary\nfrom \u201cstart your own political party\u201d\nto \u201cjoin the one closest to your\nviews and change it from within\u201d.\nNeither of which are feasible for\nthe vast majority of us, and certainly\ndon\u2019t help you if you need to vote\ntomorrow!\nInstead I would suggest going to\nspoil your ballot paper. It\u2019s quite\nfun to come up with inventive\nways to invalid your ballot and if\nthe 34% of adults who didn\u2019t vote\nall spoilt their ballot, vote hungry\nestablished parties would sit up\nand take notice and there would\nbe massive incentives for newer\nparties to innovate and try to\nharness this sudden outpouring of\ndissatisfaction.\nIt would also create a boom in\ngrassroots politics, desperate to\nengage the same, suddenly vocal,\nunhappy majority. All of the above\ncan do nothing but fuel direct\ndemocracy, perhaps then a party\nmight start to represent you more\naccurately. You can\u2019t be represented\nunless people know what you want.\nHence this is my plea to you,\nespecially those of you just starting\nyour time at this wonderful place,\nget yourself registered to vote and to\ndamn well do so, and if you decide\nto exercise your democratic right\nby drawing a massive hairy cock on\nyour ballot paper, then hurrah!\nYou can register to vote if\nyou\u2019re a British, EU or qualifying\nCommonwealth citizen. Visit\naboutmyvote.co.uk to find out if\nyou\u2019re any of the above.The London\nMayoral elections are next May.\nReally don\u2019t want to vote for anyone? Spoil the ballot.

Sure, you may be able to achieve your goal of seeing all the latest arthouse releases as soon as they hit distribution, and be\nspoiled for choice in terms of preview screenings, but unless your budget is at a Ridley Scott level, you\u2019ll soon find yourself living off cereal in order to make that Les Enfants du Paradis\nscreening you\u2019ve been hyping up. Don\u2019t despair \u2013 here at FELIX we have used our years of experience of the London cinema scene to discover the best deals in the capital, so you\u2019ll have\nmore money to go clubbing, splash out on new clothes, or just buy emergency Library Caf\u00e9 jacket potatoes.

Picturehouse Cinema \u2013 \u00a35.60\nWhile the Picturehouse chain\u2019s\nlatest opening, the Picturehouse\nCentral in Leicester Square, has\nhit the news for charging \u00a318 per\nticket at peak times, once you get\nout of the centre, things tend to be\nmuch more reasonable. The closest\nbranch to Imperial, The Gate, is\nlocated just by Notting Hill Gate\nstation, about 30 minutes from\ncampus. They offer a \u00a315 student\nmembership, which includes two\nfree tickets (peak price for students\nis \u00a311.60,so you\u2019re already making a\nsaving). This membership will then\ngive you access to \u00a35.60 tickets all-day Monday.\nNearest Station: Notting Hill\nGate\nWith the building functioning as\na cinema since 1912, Whitechapel\u2019s\nGenesis Cinema offers a piece of\nlocal history, along with ludicrously\nplush seats. They show a mixture of\nblockbuster and independent fare,\nas well as a number of special events\n\u2013 this year it hosted the annual\nTwin Peaks Festival,a celebration of\nall things Lynch, and similar things\nare planned throughout the season.\nStudent tickets are \u00a36.50, but if you\nwant the best deal you should go\nalong on Mondays, when tickets are\n\u00a34 only.\nNearest Station: Stepney Green\n2.

The\ncinema offers all the latest big-budget showings, with tickets\ncosting only \u00a34.99,all day,every day.\nBy the time of writing, it may have\nbeen replaced by a branch of The\nBreakfast Club, or maybe another\nmotherfucking Foxtons, so hop on\nthe overground fast!\nNearest Station: Peckham Rye\nThe PeckhamPlex\u2019s cheap tickets are worth making the journey south of the river.\nPhoto Credit: Time Out\n4.

Photo Credit: Rex Features\nBacteria\nare getting\nstronger,\nwhile the\nillnesses\nthey cause\nare getting\nworse\nsurface of this cold, desert planet.\n\u201cIt seems that the more we study\nMars, the more we learn how life\ncould be supported and where there\nare resources to support life in the\nfuture.\u201d\nOutbreak of drug-resistant \u2018super gonorrhoea\u2019\nA\nnew highly drug-resistant strain of\ngonorrhoea has emerged\nin the north of England,\nleading health authorities have\nwarned.First detected last March in\nLeeds, the infection has reportedly\nspread as far as Macclesfield,\nOldham and Scunthorpe.\nSome infected patients disclosed\nthat they had recently had sex with\npeople from other parts of England.\nSixteen cases have been confirmed\nby Public Health England (PHE)\nso far,all in heterosexual individuals.\nGonorrhoea is a sexually\ntransmitted bacterial infection\nthat can be passed on through\nunprotected oral, vaginal and anal\nsex. Many more people in the UK\ncould already be harboring the new\nstrain of bacteria, as patients do not\nalways experience symptoms.\nEffective treatment of gonorrhoea\nrelies on two antibiotics taken\nconcurrently, one by injection\n(ceftriaxone) and the other in tablet\nform (azithromycin). The newly\ndiscovered strain exhibits resistance\nto azithromycin, according to PHE.\nIn a statement, the British\nAssociation for Sexual Health\nand HIV (BASHH) expressed\nconcerns that \u201cthe effectiveness of\ncurrent front-line dual therapy for\ngonorrhoea will be threatened if this\nresistant strain continues to spread\nunchecked.\u201d\nIf left untreated, gonorrhoea can\nresult in infertility and chronic pain.\nPeople under the age of 25 are most\nlikely to be affected, with almost\n35,000 cases reported in England\nin 2014. Symptoms for both men\nand women can include pain during\nsex or while urinating and unusual\ndischarge.\nInfection can be prevented by\nalways using condoms with new\npartners. It is also advisable to get\nregular sexual health checks; testing\nfor gonorrhoea is easy, painless and\navailable for free on the NHS.\nThis new outbreak coincides with\nthe launch of a new Imperial College\nLondon campaign to combat\nthe rise of antibiotic resistance.\nThe Antimicrobial Resistance\nCollaborative was launched by\nProfessor Dame Sally Davies, the\nUK\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, at an\nevent last week on Imperial\u2019s South\nKensington campus.\n\u201cDrug-resistant infections are one\nof the great health challenges of our\ntime.We need the best and brightest\nCecily Johnson\nScience Writer\nminds from all academic disciplines\nand all sectors to contribute to the\nfight\u201d said Dame Sally Davies.\n\u201cWorking across disciplines to solve\nglobal challenges,like drug-resistant\ninfections, is what [Imperial] does\nbest.\u201d\nImperial College President\nProfessor Alice Gast warned that\nthe long-term consequence of\nfailure to tackle the issue of drug\nresistance would be 10 million extra\nworldwide deaths per year by 2050.\nShe called for doctors and scientists\nto take action by accelerating the\nhunt for new drugs.\n\u201cOur efforts to stem infectious\ndiseases are increasingly futile.\nBacteria are getting stronger,\nwhile the illnesses they cause are\ngetting worse. London\u2019s academics,\nbusinesses, hospitals and charities\ncan help solve this great challenge\nof our time.\n\u201cAs medicine advances, we expect\nto get healthier. But our faith in\nmedical progress is being turned on\nits head. And we should have seen\nit coming.\u201d Professor Gast added:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard the warnings. Now\u2019s\nthe time for action \u2026 to tackle this\ngreat threat to humanity.\u201d\nImperial College President calls for urgent action in combatting antibiotic resistance\n\n"

    "content": "PAGE 35\nfelixonline.co.uk SATURDAY 3rd\nOCTOBER 2015\nWELFARE felix@imperial.ac.uk\nW\nelcome to Imperial!\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re\nenjoying your\nnewfound freedom\nas freshers, and are looking forward\nto making lots of new memories and\nfriends. The first few weeks at uni\nare some of the most exciting and\nfun, because everything is still so\nnew and fresh. But on arrival, things\ncan also feel overwhelming,and very\ndifferent to what you are used to.\nBeing faced with a sea of new\npeople and having to interact with\nthem, trying to find friends and\nmake memories and join all the\ninteresting clubs and societies, can\nstart to feel like a lot of pressure. I\nknow that when I first came to uni\nI started out excited, but ended up\nfeeling a little overwhelmed by all\nthe things I could do and people I\ncould meet.\nImperial seemed so large and\neveryone seemed like they had\nalready established friendships\nand activities, and I felt like a tiny,\nunnoticeable and awkward fish in\nthis enormous pond. Home and all\nthe things that were familiar to me\nseemed very far away.\nGiven that I also often find it\nhard to talk to new people, being\nconvinced I will make a total fool of\nmyself and cause them to ostracise\nme forever,I ended up mostly staying\nin my room and only venturing out\nto a couple of freshers\u2019 events. They\nwere enjoyable, but sometimes left\nme feeling as if I hadn\u2019t managed to\nconnect with anybody properly.\nHowever, after a few weeks when\nI sorted out which clubs were to be\nmy regular commitments, I was able\nto find a core group of friends who\nshared my interests. I also made a\nfew good friends on my course who\nI am still in contact with today.\nTo deal with homesickness, I\npersonally found that trying to line\nup plenty of new and exciting things\nto do can help. Keeping busy makes\nit a lot harder to dwell on the things\nyou\u2019re missing at home \u2013 plus when\nyou next see or talk to your family,\nyou will have loads of cool stuff to\ntell them about.\nBut on the other hand, it is also\nabsolutely okay to take a day where\nyou cuddle up in your room, watch\nNetflix or a DVD, have some tea\nand chocolate and just let yourself\nfeel a bit rubbish, call your parents\nand comfort yourself with fluffy\nsocks and blankets. Of course that\u2019s\njust my method, but finding your\nown way of practising self-care and\nallowing yourself a healthy way\nto express and work through your\nemotions is very important.\nThe next most important thing\nthough is to know when to stop\nindulging yourself. After spending\na day feeling down, try to make\nyourself do something sociable, be it\nattending a freshers\u2019event or baking\ncookies in the kitchen in halls \u2013 and\ntrust me, the kitchens are wonderful\nareas for friendship-formation!\nDealing with the social anxiety\nthat made it hard to talk to people in\nthe first place was somewhat more\ndifficult, and coping mechanisms\nfor this are even more personal than\nthose of self-care. General helpful\ntips include practising breathing\nexercises or repeating some mantra\nthat gives you self-confidence,\nreinforcing your ability to just walk\nup to someone, introduce yourself,\nand start a conversation.\nAnother thing that can be useful\nis to try and pull your thoughts\ninto perspective. This is very tricky,\nand in itself the advice of \u2018get\nsome perspective\u2019 can be radically\nunhelpful.But try to take some time\nto breathe and remind yourself that\nothers probably won\u2019t notice the\nmistakes and social awkwardness\nthat seems glaring to you.\nIt can be liberating when you\naccept that things won\u2019t go perfectly\nwith everyone you say hello to.There\nCoping with tough times in this\nbrave new Imperial world\nare just so many people at Imperial\nthat it\u2019s impossible to connect with\nand befriend everybody,but this also\nmeans that amongst our number you\nare guaranteed to find some people\nwho you will \u2018click\u2019 with. Generally\nspeaking students are always\ngrateful to find another person who\nis feeling a bit overwhelmed.\nYou are under no obligation to\nimmediately form a group and have\na perfectly structured social life \u2013 it\u2019s\nokay if it takes a while to find your\ncircle of friends. But if you persist\nin investigating all the clubs and\nsocieties, and keep on striking up\nconversations with the people you\nthink are interesting, it will pay off.\nFinally, bear in mind that there\nare so many resources available for\nyou if you\u2019re feeling worried or alone\nor overwhelmed. Take a look at our\nresources section and pick a person\nor group you feel most comfortable\ntalking to \u2013 and don\u2019t forget that\nyour peers can also be a great source\nof validation and comfort!\nGood luck on your first year at\nImperial. It can be tough \u2013 the\nworkload will build up quickly \u2013\nbut it\u2019s more than worth it. I hope\nyou all get settled in and have a\nwonderful Welcome Week and rest\nof year!\nIt is very normal to feel a little overwhelmed at times when you\u2019re first starting out at uni.

Both of\nthese positions are elected and paid\nsabbatical roles.\nAfter an hour of shouting and\nThe protest by numbers\nsign waving around the meeting\nhall, protesters with megaphones\nmaneuvered through the large group\nand headed towards Parliament.\nThe handful of police officers who\nwere stationed to look after the\nevent seemed vaguely surprised\nat the movement, but were far\noutnumbered by a growing crowd\nof young, well-educated and well-behaved medics.\nOrganisers, including medical\nstudents from Imperial, had only\napplied for a stationary protest\npermit, and it was obvious that\n200 3000 \u00a323,000\nAjuniordoctor\u2019sbasicrateofpaybeforesubsidies\nfor working overtime.

It is technically\nillegal to stage a march without\nletting the police know at least six\ndays beforehand, but the timeline of\nthe protest and good behaviour of\nthe crowd meant that the organisers\nare unlikely to face any action from\nthe police.\nThe group moved across to\nParliament Square, joined by\nswathes of junior doctors, getting\noff shifts with some having brought\nyoung children. The road around\nParliament was blocked by sheer\nWe cornered\nthe Imperial\nCollege School\nof Medicine\u2019s\nelected\npresident, Med\n(right), at the\nvolumes of protesters attempting\nto walk down Whitehall.\nInstead of Downing Street, the\ngroup congregated around the\nDepartment of Health. Doctors\ncrossed the roads in huge numbers,\nstopping cars and buses, none of\nwhom had been stopped further\nup. Whether the horn tooting\nthat ensued was in frustration, or\nas the crowd interpreted them, in\nsupport, it wasn\u2019t going to make any\ndifference.

After congregating around\nthe health ministry, they bayed for\nJeremy Hunt, the health secretary,\nwhile he tweeted from safety, most\nlikely from home, about childhood\nobesity.\nWhen Hunt didn\u2019t emerge from\nthe grey buildings, despite cries of\nNO IFS, NO BUTS, NO JUNIOR\nDOCTOR CUTS, the crowd\nturned on its heel, slower than\nbefore, and edged back towards\nParliament and Big Ben. None of\nthis movement was planned, and\nthe wild gesticulation involved in\nencounters between organisers and\npolice officers made this obvious.\nAs a giant red moon rose above\nWestminster, police stopped\ntraffic again, allowing protesters\nto cross back.

It was an enjoyable\nand challenging weekend for the\nteam who attended, with Imperial\ndiscDoctors (dD) finishing 13th\nout of 16 teams in their division.\nFor the majority of the group, this\ntournament represented the first\ntime they would compete against\ntop-level club teams from around\nthe world and also the first time\nthey would play beach Frisbee.\nThe team of fifteen all arrived\nin Italy ready to take on a new\nchallenge and to have fun both on\nand off the pitch. On the first day\nof the tournament dD faced a tough\ngroup stage and managed to come\nthird in their group of four. The\nfinal game of the day was a crossover match against a strong Italian\nteam. Despite not being aware of\nthis game and swimming in the\nsea until five minutes before it was\ndue to start, dD put in a very strong\nperformance but were unable to\nsecure a win. Once the game had\nfinished, dD were able to relax on\nthe beach and watch the sun set in\nstyle with the mountains behind\nthem.\nThe next day was an early start\nand a brand new pool, based on\nFriday\u2019s results to compete in. The\nteam found this group more suited\nto their level of play and were able\nto finish second overall, after a close\ndefeat by the Warwick University\nalumni team, where dD struggled\nagainst an all-male team with\nexperience and athleticism. The\nfinal game was another cross over\nmatch, against yet another Warwick\nUniversity team. It was hard fought\nby the discDoctors but yet again\nthey could not break through their\nopponents to reach a win.\nThat evening dD attended the\ntournament party, which was \u2018Kings\nand Queens\u2019 themed. With the\nparty being held on the same site\nas the team\u2019s accommodation, this\nwas a great opportunity for the\nteam to relax after another day of\nultimate, mingle with players from\nother teams and get dressed up! Tin\nfoil proved a useful asset to costume\nmaking, with crowns and even\ndragon wings being made to keep\nwith the party theme.\nWith another early start on\nSunday, dD were beginning to\ntire from the hard days of playing.\nHowever, they managed to sail\nthrough their first game of the day.\nAlthough the team were tired from\nthe night before, dD managed to\nreach the point cap of 13 whilst\nconceding only a few points. The\nteam was working well together\nand communicating effectively with\nthe disc easily flowing between the\nhandlers \u2013 dD had reached their\nstride.\nWinning their first game meant\nthat dD were to play Sky Hawks,\nan experienced Swiss team they had\nbeaten the previous day. The last\nmatch had been close, but Imperial\nknew it would be even tougher this\ntime round. discDoctors had the\ninitial momentum and managed to\ndraw out a lead before Sky Hawks\nbattled back with some big grabs\nin the end-zone to bring the scores\nlevel at eight all. The final point of\nthe game was again close, with both\nteams turning over, however dD\nstayed patient on the disc, before a\nforehand caught easily in the endzone brought the game to an end,\nand Imperial to a final finishing\nplace of 13th.\nFor a team not used to playing on\nsand and who always tried to have\nat least two women per line in a\nmostly male division, discDoctors\nplayed extremely well over the\nweekend,which is promising for the\nupcoming university season.\nUltimate Frisbee train twice\na week and regularly compete\nin tournaments throughout the\nAutumn and Spring terms. All\nare welcome to attend training,\nregardless of experience.

Content can be\nsubmitted to any section editor\nat any time, but this is when the\nmajority of ideas get discussed.\nFELIX Arts will have already\nsent students out to shows and\nexhibitions for reviews, while sports\nteams write up their match reports\nas soon as they finish celebrating\n(or commiserating). Science will\nbe eyeing up the latest discoveries,\nFood will be cooking up ideas and\nHangman thinks about crawling\nout of his dungeon to predict your\nfuture for the next week.\nWriters can come down to the\noffice in the west basement of Beit\nQuad and use our shiny shiny Macs,\nor work from home \u2013 whatever\nenvironment you prefer to get stuff\ndone in. There\u2019s usually a couple of\nus in the office. Section editors will\nusually set their own deadlines for\nsubmissions, so just ask them when\nthey need an article finished by.\nMonday\nOur glorious leader \u2013 Editorin-Chief Grace Rahman \u2013 starts\ndrawing up the pagination\nspreadsheet, asking each section\u2019s\neditors to confirm how many\npages they\u2019d like to fill that week.\nShe figures out how much ad\nspace we\u2019ve sold and makes sure\nsomeone\u2019s organising a (tasteful)\nnude photoshoot of a club, society\nor project for the Centrefold.\nWe\u2019ve got 40 pages to fill and by\nnow the content is flooding in to\nthe section editors. Big pieces for\nthe Features and News sections are\nbeing researched and lots of coffee\nis consumed. At this point we still\nhave no idea what will be on the\nfront page.\nTuesday\nSection editors will usually set\ntheir final submission deadline\nfor Monday or Tuesday at the\nlatest, so they can get down to the\nbasement and start laying out. We\nuse software called InDesign to put\nthe paper together, working from\ntemplates to make sure each section\nhas a common look.\nAround 900 words fill a page\nof FELIX \u2013 450 for half a page \u2013\nbut often content comes in a little\nover so the editors will have to play\naround with the scissors and make\nsure everything fits. Editors will\nfind photographs and graphics to\ngo with each piece and come up\nwith headlines as they go.\nWednesday\nOne by one, sections are laid out\nand ticked off ready for the final\ncopy and layout edit. The News\nteam will have a few articles ready\nto go, but more news is always\nbreaking \u2013 if we\u2019re half a page\nshort at this point we can almost\nguarantee something will happen\ntomorrow to fill the space.\nAdverts and Centrefolds are sent\nin by today and Hangman coughs\nup some witty satire. Puzzles puts\ntogether a page or two of sudoku,\nslitherlink or crossword puzzles\nto entertain you between lectures.\nThe office is always buzzing on\na Wednesday as everyone starts\nworrying about tomorrow\u2019s print\ndeadline.\nThursday\nPanic stations! Our crack team\nof copy and layout editors take the\nreins, working through the entire\npaper again making sure everyone\nsuccessfully dotted their \u2018I\u2019s and\ncrossed their \u2018T\u2019s. Most of the\nproblems at this stage are simple\ntweaks to improve the paper\u2019s\ndesign and readability.\nSometimes, however, things get\nstressful on Thursdays \u2013 we might\nfind that a section promised more\npages of content than they actually\nput together, forcing us to write\nsomething quickly to fill the space.\nConversely, we might also need to\nbump some excess content to next\nweek\u2019s issue.\nWe scramble to finish the News\nstories and design the front page.\nGrace writes an editorial piece,\ncommenting on the events of the\nweek or something of interest\nfeatured in another part of the\npaper. Finally the whole issue is\nfinished and ready to send over to\nthe print company. We celebrate!\nFriday\nDeeply hungover, a few of us drag\nour sorry selves back to Beit Quad\nearly(ish) in the morning to see the\nfruits of our efforts; overnight a van\nhas delivered a giant pile of fresh-off-the-print newspapers. We load\nup the trolley and get distributing\nthousands of copies of FELIX all\nover the South Kensington campus.\nA few bundles of papers are taken\nto the internal post office to be sent\nto Imperial\u2019s campuses in St Mary\u2019s,\nCharing Cross, White City and\nHammersmith. Finally we reserve\nsome copies to send to the British\nLibrary for archiving, and a bundle\nto have bound in giant leather books\nfor those of us who want a memento\nof our time here.\nAfter distribution we grab some\nfood \u2013 cheeky Nando\u2019s or maybe\na liquid lunch in FiveSixEight \u2013\nand breathe a sigh of relief. Then\nmembers of the Web team come in\nand make sure every article in the\npaper gets posted on felixonline.\nco.uk for those of you who don\u2019t like\ngetting inky fingers.\nAnd then, of course, the cycle\nrepeats! We publish every Friday\nduring term time except in the\nlast week, as well as putting bonus\ncontent online throughout the year.\nWe have many leather-bound books and our office smells of rich mahogany.

One of the\nbiggest challenges for many will be\nlearning how to make tasty, healthy\nmeals on a budget.\nSome of you may never have\ncooked before, and with that in\nmind FELIX Food are presenting\nfour simple, basic recipes to try out\nwhile you\u2019re still learning which end\nof the spatula is which \u2013 plus a few\nextra tips to get you going as you\u2019re\nunleashed in the Hall kitchens.\nI\u2019ve given you the recipes for my\nlegendary chocolate brownies, a\nfresh pasta sauce for when you get\nsick of the stuff in jars, chicken\nfried rice to help use up leftover rice\nand vegetables, and classic British\ncomfort meal: toad in the hole.\nCecily Johnson\nFood Writer\nThere are\ntonnes of\nresources\nonline\nFreshipes: How to make a basic...\nFour fabulous foods to get you started in the challenging task of feeding yourself\nIngredients:\n250g unsalted butter\n200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa)\n80g cocoa powder\n65g plain flour\n1 tsp baking powder\n360g caster sugar\n4 large eggs\n75g white chocolate chips\n75g mixed nuts (brazil, hazelnut)\nStart by melting the chocolate\nand butter together (microwave in\n10 second blasts and stir). Mix all\nthe dry goods together in a bowl\nand add the chocolatey mix.\nBeat the eggs together then\nstir into the rest until everything\nis combined. Add the nuts and\nchocolate chips last, then pour\ninto a brownie tin or any dish with\ntall enough sides. Bake at 180\u00baC\nfor about 25 mins; they should be\ncooked through but still fudgy.\n...Chocolate Brownie\nIngredients:\n1x 400g tin plum tomatoes\n1 stick of celery\n1 carrot\n1 large onion\n1 tbsp tomato puree\n1 tbsp olive oil\nsalt and pepper\na handful of fresh basil (or dried)\nbay leaf or any other herbs\nFinely chop your celery, carrots\nand onions. Fry them up in the oil\nuntil they soften up and get a light\nbrown colour.\nPour in the tomatoes and add the\nherbs, salt and pepper to taste, plus\na glass of water. Mix it all up and\ncover with a lid.\nSimmer the mixture on a low\nheat for half an hour, stirring it\noccasionally.

Raking in dollar like\nthe banker wanker Imperial wants\nus to be (obvsiously for alumni\ncontributions). Cotching in Sierra\nLeone,battling the Ebola epidemic?\nWell actually, avid readers, I\u2019m\ncurrently rolling around on my\nparents\u2019 couch in urban Berkshire,\nfeeding on my mother\u2019s (perfectly\nround) chapattis and writing for my\nold student newspaper. That\u2019s right\nkids,I\u2019m unemployed (and Asian,so\ndouble whammy there but at least\nI\u2019m defying stereotypes).\nThus, this is my probably-not-very-weekly column on the world\nof graduate bliss. Willkommen my\npretties, to the life of the angry\ngrad. Seeing as it\u2019s freshers\u2019 (woops,\nfist pumps, claps chaotically like a\nslippery seal), this column is about\nwhat to expect from freshers\u2019 week;\u00ad\nwhat to do,what not to do and what\nI would do differently. Trust me\nkids, take my advice, I\u2019ve turned out\ngreat (if in doubt, refer to the intro\nabove... I mean, I get my washing\ndone for me, be envious).\nFirst and foremost, be excited!\nYou\u2019ve left the nest (for now),\nhurrah! Genuinely, congratulations\non getting here. It is an achievement,\nand don\u2019t let those Oxbridge\nrejections get you down! If you are\nfeeling bitter,just remember: at least\nyou\u2019re not at UCL, with all their\nfit arts students and University of\nLondon benefits.\nAnyway, freshers\u2019 is truly the time\nto go big or go home. Come out of\nyour shell, be spontaneous, and if\nyou hate the morons/friends you\u2019ve\nmade in a couple of weeks, not a\nproblem! Getting an upgrade is\nbloody easy; if Eleanor\u2019s jodhpurs\nand shocking horsey tales are\ngetting on your tits, tell her you love\na ready meal \u201cbeef\u201d lasagne and you\nwon\u2019t even recognise her two years\non. I mean, be ruthless.\nWasabi\nis an evil\ntemptress,\nenticing you\nwith her\nsushi\nYou do get to graduate here. That\u2019s a benefit, right? Right? Photo Credit: Imperial College London\nSecondly, turn down your bloody\nexpectations of what University\nentails. You\u2019re at Imperial for god\u2019s\nsake, not Loughborough/Leeds\nMet/anywhere with more than one\ngood looking bloke within a 10\nmile radius. We have a reputation\nof nerdsdom to live up to! You\nwill most likely not be going out\nfive times a week or grinding on a\nchirpsing second year in the erotic\nego\u00ad\nboosting steam room that is any\ncentral London club. You live in\nLondon now, you will be broke.\nYes, you might spend your money\non alcohol over food because you\u2019re\na studentLAD and yes, Wasabi will\nsteal all your sterling. For you new\nto London cuties, Wasabi is an evil\ntemptress, enticing you with her\nperfectly salty and starchy sushi\nor curry delicacies. While she may\nmake the voices in your head stop\nthrowing around anti\u00ad\npsychotic drug\nnames (which ironically, you will\nprobably rather need than study) for\ntwenty minutes, she will also make\nyou crash into a worthwhile food\ncoma.\nSo yeah, you can\u2019t spend six quid\non a tofu curry and another twenty\nin Soho\u2019s finest discotheques every\nnight (plus a bloated stomach is\nnever attractive in body con, gurl, so\nreally, Wasabi saves your liver). The\noverdraft struggle is real my friend.\nIf you can afford to party that hard,\nyou\u2019re probably either a) spending\nyour nights in Metric,which is never\ncool, or b) the child of a sheikh. I\ndespise you Sheikh spawn, you,\nwith your super snazzy multimillion\npound South Kensington flat, and\nyour mind\u00ad\nblowing ability to make\nshisha look cool.\nLastly, get involved. Join clubs and\nsocieties, (write for FELIX, please).\nThey\u2019re the perfect place to expand\nyour Facebook friend count and get\naway from your course mates. That\u2019s\nmy biggest regret, not involving\nmyself in clubs and societies\nproperly. You see those netball girls\nwearing those tiny nurse\u2019s costumes\nat Drs and Nurses club nights, who\nyou judge from the bottom of your\nheart? You could be one of them!\nYou probably weren\u2019t that cool\nat school, but at Imperial, we have\ndifferent standards. You CAN be\na plastic or a jock, because, well,\nIMPERIAL, YO.\nWelcome to Imperial, you fools. Our resident anonymous\ngraduate columnist is only slightly bitter...\n\n"

However, as any of the biologists can tell you, in order to survive the jungle that is the university food chain, you need to find your ecological niche. Maybe a #unilad? Only if you\nwant to spend the next three years necking snakebite with a group of fucking wankers named \u2018Jonno\u2019.High flyer? Unless you\u2019re prepared to lock yourself in your room and risk a breakdown\nbefore freshers\u2019week has even finished, you should just aim for a 2:1. Luckily for you, the role of \u2018corridor film snob\u2019is easy to fill. We\u2019ve even provided you with a guide, so tear down that\nStar Wars poster, sit down, and pay attention.\nAlmod\u00f3var,\nPedro:\nRemember, accent at the end.\nIt\u2019s Almo-DO-var, you fucking\nuncultured cretins.\nBergman,\nIngmar:\n\u2018Yeah, it really reminded me of\nPersona\u2019. Never explain how.\nCritics:\nRemember, film critics all know\nnothing, unless they validate your\nown opinion. Complain about the\nrating system. Say that you can\u2019t\nplace a number on art. Secretly\nattend everything The Guardian\ngives five stars to.\nDubbing:\nGive me original language or give\nme death. Placing chopsticks into\nyour ears would be preferable to\nseeing a dubbed French film for you.\nEating in the\ncinema:\nGod, just die already.\nFight Club:\nFYI \u2013 It\u2019s not a \u2018Cult Film\u2019 if\neveryone\u2019s fucking seen it.\nGenres:\nDilettantes of cinema seem to\nthink there are a set number of\ngenres: comedy, drama, romance,\naction etc. But you know better. As\nanyone who\u2019s read a music review\non Pitchfork knows, the best way to\nseem to know what you\u2019re talking\nabout is to be as unintelligible as\npossible, and this is where obscure\nfilm genres come in. Wikipedia has\na list of about 200 different ones, so\nthere\u2019s no excuse for not being able\nto tell your Metacinema from your\nMumblecore\nHype:\nWhat kind of person comes to\nmind when you think of the word\ncool? Wearing lots of black? Most\ndefinitely. Sunglasses on indoors?\nPerhaps. Excited about anything?\nNo fucking way. Remember that\nhype is the devil trying to get you\nto look like a nark, and never reveal\njust how fucking pumped you are\nabout the new Star Wars.\nImage-Maker:\nUsing terms like director and\nfilmmaker are so trite nowadays,\nand the time when you could refer\nto Hitchcock as an \u2018artist\u2019 is long\ngone. Now, in order to be hip, you\u2019ve\ngotta use terms like \u2018Image-Maker\u2019,\nor perhaps \u2018Image-Creator\u2019 when\ndescribing your favourite auteurs.\nJudging\nothers:\nYeah, you\u2019ll be doing this a lot\u2026\nKickstarter:\nCrowdfunding used to be a\nnice little niche industry; a way\nfor creative people, who wouldn\u2019t\notherwise have the resources, to\nachieve their vision.\nBut then Zach Braff (net worth:\n$22 million) convinced nearly\n50,000 idiots to fund his next pet\nproject, Wish I Was Here, a critical\nand commercial disaster. We don\u2019t\ntalk about crowdfunding anymore.\nLynchian, use\nof:\nWhile technically meaning a\nbalance of the mundane and the\nmacabre, as found in Lynch\u2019s work,\nuse it to describe any film that\nfulfils any of the following criteria:\nis bleak; has a weird soundtrack;\nfeatures a dream sequence; features\na dance sequence; is in black and\nwhite; you find it confusing and\nyou don\u2019t know why. When you\u2019re\nconstructing an opinion of a film,\nsubstitute in for every third word\nand you\u2019re in business.\nMainstream\ncinema,\nboycott of:\n\u2018You guys are off on a hall trip\nto see the new Hunger Games at\nImperial Cinema? Ah, I wish I\nwas free, but I\u2019m going to see an\nexperimental art film from the 60s\nof a man in a relationship with a\ncheesegrater. It\u2019s all about Vietnam.\nObviously.\u2019\nNames,\npronunciation\nof:\nRemember, the harder a film/\ndirector\u2019s name is to pronounce, the\nbetter it sounds. Prime example:\nKoyaanisqatsi.\nOriginals vs\nRemakes:\nSimilar to the dubbing idea. The\nnewer film may have a bigger budget,\nbetter actors, a more coherent\nscript, and special effects that don\u2019t\nlook like a child\u2019s Christmas play,\nbut for you the original is always\nbetter. Complain about the remake\nendlessly. Never go and see it.\nFight Club:\nYou can\u2019t call\nit a \u2018Cult Film\u2019\nif everyone\u2019s\nfucking seen\nit...\nPosters:\nA chance to put some of your\npersonality on your bedroom wall. 1\npoint for a foreign film. 2 points for\na foreign film poster in a different\nlanguage. 3 points for anything\nPolish \u2013 that shit cray.\nQuestions:\n\u2018What kind of movies do you\nlike?\u2019, the biochemist on your floor\nasks at the hall social. \u2018I prefer to\nlook at cinema in terms of directors\u2019,\nyou reply. It\u2019s over. You win. You\nhave won Cinema.\nRealism:\nBasically,in order to really impress\npeople you need to par down your\ninterests into two main camps:\ndisturbingly depressing realism, and\ndepressingly disturbing fantasy. You\ncan either watch Olivia Colman\nbeing urinated on in graphic detail\nin Tyrannosaur, or John Nance\ncutting open a mutated foetus in\nEraserhead. As long as you\u2019re sure\nyou won\u2019t get any sleep that night\nyou\u2019re in business.\nSundance\nFestival:\nEveryone says that Sundance is the\nnew Cannes, but we all know that\nreally TIFF is the new Sundance,\nBerlin is the new Telluride, and\nanyone who\u2019s anyone heads to\nLocarno come August. What were\nwe talking about again?\nTime:\nThe best films are all either 75\nminutes long,or 5 hours.Everything\nelse is shit. Make your opinion on\nthis well known by loudly espousing\nit in the hall kitchen at 2am .\nUnderground:\nUnderground cinema is good.\nUnderground cinemas are better.\nWatching underground cinema in\nan underground cinema is best.\nVHS:\nAs vinyl records are to music twats,\nVHS cassettes are to film snobs.\nWidescreen:\nAs aspect ratios get larger and\nlarger,it\u2019s only a matter of time until\nfilms are beamed directly onto our\neyeballs. Make your opinion on this\ntravesty known by refusing to watch\nanything that\u2019s not in 4:3 ratio.\nX-Rated:\nNow you\u2019ve escaped the\nawkwardness of watching nude\nscenes with your parents, you\u2019re free\nto watch as many R-rated films as\nyou want. Just remember \u2013 if there\u2019s\nno explanation for the nudity, it\u2019s\nart.\nLynchian: Use it to describe\nany film that has a weird\nsoundtrack, features a dream\nsequence, features a dance\nsequence, is in black and\nwhite, or you find confusing.\nY\nchromosome:\nAbsolutely necessary to become a\nsuccessful film director, apparently.\nIn the BFI\u2019s latest poll of film critics,\nout of the top 250 films, only seven\nwere directed by women, and this\ninequality seems to span the whole\nindustry. Show off your feminist\nchops with ready references to\nAgnes Varda, Chantal Akerman,\nand Joanna Hogg.\nZero:\nThe number of friends you will\nhave if you follow this guide. Film\nsnobs are awful people, everyone\nknows that. But at least you have\nyour Criterion Kurosawa Collection\nto keep you warm at night.\nThe harder a\nfilm/director\u2019s\nname is to\npronounce,\nthe better it\nsounds in\nconversation.\nExample:\nKoyaanisqatsi.\nWhen you first arrive in halls, clutching your belongings, it can seem like a scary place. It is. Assert your cultural dominance\nby becoming a film snob. Photo Credit: David Lynch/Creative Commons\nDecorate your room with freaky Polish film posters! No-one will ever want to\nvisit, giving you more time to watch arthouse films. Photo Credit: Cin\u00e9philia\n\u2018I would literally rather have my eyes sliced open with razor blades than watch fucking Harry Potter again\u2019 \u2013 you, all the\ntime.

But the\nfact that it took photos of a drowned\nthree year old boy on a Turkish\nbeach should disturb us all.\nThe photo of Aylan Kurdi\u2019s\nlimp body became the defining\nimage of this summer, with many\npublications refusing to publish\nthe pictures showing his full body;\nbut before long this three year old\u2019s\ncorpse had become nothing more\nthan clickbait to be shared among\nsocial media users as an attempt to\nlook interested in something other\nthan themselves.\nOne newspaper was even\nadvocating at the end of an article\nabout Aylan Kurdi\u2019s journey to tweet\nusing the hashtag #refugeeswelcome\nand then to sign their own petition,\nwhich all feels so very close to the\n\u2018pat yourself on the back\u2019 culture of\negotistical charity support that we\nonly recently saw with the ALS ice\nbucket challenge.\nPerhaps social media is again\nculpable: the sidebar on the right of\nthe Facebook home page now gives\nall users a brief list of current events,\nallowing us to selectively participate\nin what has been deemed important.\nIt feels like once again our national\nreaction to this tragedy is one of self\naggrandising for the small time we\nspend campaigning for social action,\nand by signing an online petition we\ncan go forward and forget.\nThe one thing that makes me\nfeel incredibly uncomfortable is\nthe fact that only now when the\nimage of this dead child has been\nseen are people starting to wake up\nto this crisis. Since May there has\nbeen report after report after report\nGermany is\nobviously\ndesperate\nto regain\nsome\ncontrol over\nthe situation\nWhy did\nit take an\nimage of a\ndead child\nto change\nthe national\nsentiment?\nof asylum seekers crossing the\nmediterranean sea to escape from\na home that is no longer safe, often\nwith hundreds of people crammed\ninto these small boats, hopefully\nmaking it to Greece, but more often\nthan not, relying on a European\ncoastguard being nearby to save\nthem.\nThat is four months that we\nhave known about the journeys\nbeing made on a daily basis, with\na different headline for a different\nnumber of survivors.\nThat is four months for us to ask\nDavid Cameron to reconsider his\nposition on not taking anymore\nasylum seekers.\nThat is four months to try to treat\nThe scale of what Europe is\nfacing rapidly hit me. Although\nstill accepting refugees, Germany\nis obviously desperate to regain\nsome control over the situation, and\nthe border at this rail crossing is\nprobably going to remain closed for\nsome time.I had to find another way\nto get to Munich.\nTickets into Germany were scarce,\nselling out quickly, and mainly only\navailable at sales offices, not online.\nBuses seemed to be the only way,\nbut with roadblocks throughout\nAustria, and the border being\npartially closed, it wasn\u2019t clear if\nanything would be running at all,\nhow delayed it might be, or if it\nmight have to turn back. Neither\nthe bus operators nor the staff at\nthe bus stations could offer any\nreassurances. After a day of chasing\ntickets for services that shortly got\ncancelled, I shelled out a final \u20ac40\nfor a night bus that looked hopeful,\nand settled down for an evening\nof obsessing about roadblocks and\nborder controls.\nJust before midnight, dozens of\nclearly stressed people waited for\nthe bus, worrying about where\nthey would stay should they be\nleft without anywhere to go in the\nmiddle of the night. When the\nbus finally arrived, the passengers\ndesperately swarmed towards it,\noverpowering the driver.\nI was lucky. The only thing that\nthis cost me was a wasted ticket to\nthe ballet (that I didn\u2019t go to so I\ncould catch the bus), some money,\nand a few hours of my time. I\nwas stressed, for sure, but it was\nnothing compared to the stress\nand desperation that has become\nthe reality for many families whose\nlives have become a matter of trying\nto find ways to travel to the next\ncountry.\nIn most of the central European\ncountries, people are clearly very\nsympathetic to their plight, and\nare very willing to offer provisions,\nbelongings, time and space to help\nease the situation.\nIn the UK we\u2019re clearly shielded\nfrom the worst of this crisis. Beyond\nthe basics in the news, I hadn\u2019t\nkept abreast of all the reporting\nsurrounding this exodus of\nhumanity,and so it wasn\u2019t until I saw\nthe crisis for myself that it became\nmore of a reality, and I immediately\nbecome far more empathetic.\nCold, hard facts can tell you a\nlot about a situation, but to really\nunderstand it, you need to feel.\nPeople write about their opinions\nto convey their emotional response\nto those that cannot witness\nsomething first\u00adhand.\nThrough observing the reaction of\nothers,wecanbemoreinformed,and\ndraw more educated conclusions for\nourselves. Through discussion, we\ncan challenge negative sentiments,\nspread awareness, and explore new\nviewpoints.\nOur opinions are what define\nus as people, and what makes us\nOur opinions\nare what\ndefine us as\npeople, and\nwhat make\nus human\nhuman. It is my opinion that if we\nexperience something that changes\nour perspective, it is almost our duty\nto share that.\nI am humbled to admit that the\nconclusions I draw at first are not\nalways the way that I want to see\nthings, and it is the ideas of others\nthat change that. Comment is\nsomething that is important to me,\nand something that I\u2019m proud of.\nIf you also think that sharing your\ncomments can change the world, email\nme at comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk,\nand join my team of opinionated\nwriters who probably love a good\nargument.\nthese people as people rather than a\nfaceless\u00ad\n, job-taking horde.\nMy question is: why did it take an\nimage of a dead child to change the\nnational sentiment?\nIt has to be said that within\nEurope there is a general unease\nabout allowing more migrants into\nthe respective countries, and in\nBritain it is even further heightened\nby our national propensity to feel\nthat we are separate to the rest of\nEurope and its woes, whether that\nbe economic, social, or political.\nThere is a palpable unease within\nthe parties as to what the British\npeople\u2019s attitude to remaining in the\nEU is.\nI believe that a great amount\nof that comes from our heavily\ningrained idealism that as an island\nnation the literal geographical\nseparation also separates us from\nthe aforementioned issues, and\ntherefore a responsibility for them.\nWhat remains now is to wait until\nthe situation settles: at the time\nof writing, the Hungarian border\npolice have set up a barrier to the\ndisplaced peoples, retaliating in\nwaves of tear gas and baton strikes.\nCroatia has become the new route\nto pursue for these people,with their\nprime minister freely admitting that\nthere is no way that they can stop\nthe flow of asylum seekers.\nThe truth is that no one knows\nwhat will happen with this current\ncrisis\u00ad\n: will Cameron relent with the\ncurrent figure of 20,000 migrants\nover the next 5 years, will there\nbe an E.U consensus on a unified\nresponse to work towards a more\nstable Europe?\nFrankly this situation will only\ntake time, money, and planning.\nWhat it doesn\u2019t need is views, likes,\nand shares.\n\n"
