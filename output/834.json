    "content": "Clubs/Sport\nTHIRD WORLD FIRST\nNestle kills\nbabies!\n1C Third World First is participating\nin the Nestle Boycott campaign\nwhich was relaunched this March.\nThis article explains why.\nFour v ears after the end of the last\nNestle boycott, Dr Raj Anand, a pae dia tricia n from Bombay told a press conference in Washington\n'Bottle feeding is killing babies...say\nno to Nestle.'\nThe initial campaign started in\n1977 following worldwide exposure\nof the devastating effects of baby\nmilk promotion. Illiteracy, lack of\nhygienic conditions, clean water and\nfuel for sterilisation combined with\npoverty and made bottle feeding\nlethal. Despite this, baby milk\ncompanies continued to use\naggressive marketing techniques to\nmake a killing. Massive advertising,\nsales reps dressed as nurses,\nsponsored bab v shows and free\nsamples all contributed to a decline\nin breast feeding and rise in infant\nillness. James Grant, director of\nUNICEF, estimates these practices\ncaused a million extra deaths\nworldwide each year.\nThis campaign forced Nestle to\nsign an agreement with protestors\nand the boycott was lifted. But today\nNestle are up to the same dirty\ntricks. Nestle continues to dump\nbab v milk supplies on hospitals in\nover 20 countries, particularly Africa\nand Asia, in direct violation of the\nWorld Health Organisation International Code of Marketing\nBreast Milk Substitutes, adopted in\n1981. These supplies inevitably get\ndistributed and impede breast\nfeeding. \"Free samples are not\ncharity, they are a marketing ploy\nto increase'profits: breast feeding\nstops so the mother e have to buy\nNestles milk.\nTo make the boycott most\neffective cut out Nescafe.\nOther Nestle products include:\nRowntree Mackintosh, Polo.\nNescafe, Blend 37, Nesquick, Cello,\nIdeal, Fulcreem Custard, Elevenses,\nSarsons Vinegar, Chambourcy,\n\u2022Darkly, Le Grande, Cham by, Nouvelle, Robot, Jacky, Fox's Mints,\nMilo, Mix-o Choc, Superquick, Flolite, Fine Blend, Findus, Eskimo,\nLean Cuisine, Hippopota, Bonjour,\nFlamby, Fromage Frais, Creme\nVienna, Kremby, Sun-Pat, Kit Kat,\nAnimal Bar, Milkmaid, Flo-Mix,\nKarima, Maggi, Libby, C Drinks,\nMoonshine, Carnation, CoffeeMate, Slender, Build Up, Go-Cat\nand Dog, Gales, Buitoni, Original\nCookie Co., Caro Coffee Substit.,\nTip Top, Ashbourne Water, Alta\nRica, Crosse & Blackwell, Waistline,\nBranston, B \u00abnne Cuisine, Cook in\nthe Pot, Rice & Things, 4 Seasons,\nPasta Choice, Dish of the Day.\nAs a far better alternative to\nNescafe, try Oxfam's Nicaraguan\nCoffee, the profits of which go to the\npeople and not to Western owned\ncompanies that exploit Third World\nworkers. Nicaragua has suffered\ngreatly because of its debts and the\nUS trade embargo, and Coffee\npickers have often been the victims\nof attacks by the US aided Contras.\n(Traidcraft also sell non-exploitative\ncoffee and teas.)\nFor more information contact C Wong, Phvsics or Babv Milk Action,\n6 Regent Terrace, Cambridge CB2\n1A A. Tel: 0223 464420.\nI am prepared to sell Traidcraft\nand Oxfam's teas and coffees on a strictly non-profit basis. Filter or de-caff coffee is available. Tea is\navailable in loose packets or 120 one\nor two cup bags.\nSCOUT & GUIDE\nCalling all\noutdoor types\nScout and Guide, being generally\nall-round people, decided it would\nbe a jolly nice idea to go to Scotland\nduring the Easter hol s just gone\n(alas!). It was therefore decided that\nGlen Shiel would be the place to go\nand do our all-round outdoor type\nof thing. However, somewhere\nalong the way, someone decided it\nwould be a terrific idea if we were\nto set off early in the morning to\ntravel during the day. So, there I was, stood outside Beit Arch at 7am on a Saturday morning wondering\nwhere the hell I had left my brain.\nThose ever-so-luxurious union vans\nneeded to be packed, and then the\npeople somehow crammed in on top (why is it that the people come\nlast?). Then guess what? The bane of\nevery club trying to get away on\ntime, the people who turn up late.\nNow we had one guy who was\ncoming all the way from Germany\njust to go away with us, you think\nhe would have had the decency to\nturn up on time wouldn't you? He\ndid finally arrive of course, not too\nlate in the end, and off we set. One\nvan was to go up the old M1/M6 (ie\nthe obvious route) and the other one\nwas to go up the East cost route.\nWhy? Because one of our number\nhad left his ka g at a friends house\nin Ripon, of course, it's quite simple\nreally! Also we were due to pick up\nsome 12 year-old in Durham, a younger vers on of one of our\nnumber no less.\nWell to cut a long (oh! so very\nlong) story short, we eventually\narrived at our humble abode in the\nHighlands at around 10pm. By the\nway, thanks very much to Louise\nand to Mike and Rupert's mum for\nproviding much needed\nrefreshments along the way! For\nthose of vo u who aren't quite sure\nof where Glen Shief is, take out a map of Scotland, find Skve and then\nmove your finger down and to the\nright a bit. The aforementioned\n'humble abode' b v the way, was a3 storey shooting lodge on the shore\nof aver v beautiful lock. This meant\nof course that we had real beds to\nsleep in for a change, and that our\nmeals were served onto a real table\nin a real dining room! The plastic\nbowls and mugs which we use did\nseem rather incongruous, but as\nmost people are simply interested in\nstuffing their faces then trying to\nsteal somebody else's as well,\nnobody complained.\nGlen Shiel offers an enormous\nvariety of things to do, so long as it\ninvolves walking or scrambling up\nmountains! There are the Brothers\nand Sisters; the Saddle and friends\nwhich can be reached by a great\nscramble; the South Glen Shief\nRidge with its seven Munros and\nmany other variations and routes\ntaking in various combinations of\nthese. All of these, and others, were\nattempted by members of the\ngroup, and a great time was had by\nall. To be precise, two Swedish\nguys, the blok e who now lives in\nGermany, plus numerous other\nstragglers from all reaches of the\nUK.\nThe only problem that some of us\nhad all week was sunburn! Yes, you\ncan forget the Med. just pop up to\nBonnie Scotland and be very, very\nlucky. We went during the last week\nof the hol s, so there was reasonably\nfresh snow on the tops of the\nmountains. We also happened to hit\na sunny patch in the weather, so\nwalking along the tops was a really\ndazzling business! Walking over\nvirgin snow in bright sunshine is\nreally rather strange, because your\neyes have a hell of a job trying to\nfocus on something. You have to\nlook at the end of your boots or at\nsome distant piece of rock otherwise\nyou are likely to fall flat on your face\nbecause your balance goes! The\nsnow did, though, provide ample\nopportunity for sledging or sliding\naround and generally playing silly\nbuggers. One particular decent from\na mountain simply involved putting\non waterproof trousers and sitting\ndown\u2014gravity did the rest!\nAs for the rest of this term,\nnothing too strenuous with the big\nE's and all. This weekend we have\nour Annual Dinner in Derbyshire,\nthen after the exams a weekend of\ncream teas in Cornwall, then for\nthose lucky enough to be going, the\nsummer tour is to Norway for three\nweeks!\nSome of our number though have\norganised an expedition to Peru for\na month or three. I would like to\nwish them the best of luck on ba half of all the members of S&G, and to\nthose of vo u that haven't bought aT Shirt from them, do so soon.\nGood luck chaps, don't go falling off\nanything!\no.s. c. Elections\nThe Overseas Students Committee\nwill be having elections for the new\nCommittee on Thursday 11th April\nat 12.45pm in room 408 Elec Eng.\nThe posts that are up for grabs\nare:\n1.

One of the buses\nhad been taken by St Mary's Rugby Club when it wasn't booked by them and the other\nhad to make an unscheduled trip\nto the hospital with one of the\nevening's casualties.\nMany thanks to all who helped\nand who've helped all year,\nparticularly Milan Lester for driving the van practically until\ndawn.\nElections\nThere are still a few posts available\nfor next year as Union Officers (and\nfor this year unfortunately).

    "content": "Letters\nAUT Response\nTo Richard Spencer and Charles Brereton. '\n1 have been urged b v members of mv Association\nto respond publicly to v our letter concerning the\nAUT action on examinations, which was\naddressed to members of academic staff in the\nCollege.\nThe decision to withdraw from the examination\nprocess is a serious action which has never been\ntaken before in the history of the AUT. It is seen\nb v members as a last desperate measure to\npersuade the CVC P to listen to our demands. You\nmay be interested to hear that the action has\nfinally had the effect of extracting an offer. On26 January the CVC P made an offer of 3% to AUT from April 1989 and a lump sum equal to 3% from\nJanuary to March 1989. The CVC P themselves\nadmit that the figure is derisory and the AUT are\nawaiting a more sensible offer. As soon as the\nCVC P can make an acceptable proposal the action\nwill be called off and the examination process will\nbe recovered very quick lv. My colleagues are therefore questioning wh v vo u are not writing to our Rector over this matter.\nThe Rector is a member of the CVC P and it is to\nhim that representations should be made, to urge\nthe CVC P to make an acceptable offer to the AUT as soon as possible. We were recently told by the\nRector that the projected accumulated deficit for\nImperial College, indicated in the financial plan,\nnow amounted to about a million pounds. In the\ncircumstances the Rector could not support an\nincrease above the 3% offered. However, it has\njust been announced that the College in fact\nexpects to be in credit this year. Perhaps the\nRector will now be able to support those of his\ncolleagues on the CVC P who wish to make an\nacceptable offer to the AUT. Yours sincerely,\nSusan Parry, President ICAUT.\nNot boring\nDear Bill,\nI am writing concerning your policy, or lack of\nit, on clubs and societies.\nIn last week's copy of FELIX we read how you\n'would like to see Clubs and Sports pages\nexpanded' which you then claim you cannot do\nunless the clubs 'are willing to submit articles'.\nIn the same issue we see that you chose to head\na letter as 'Boring' which was complaining about\nyour treatment of ' One shitty clubs article'\n(apparently your words).\nGoing back a few more issues we read that you\ncannot guarantee to print club articles and that\nyou are offering to break the nose of anyone who\ninsists that you print their letters etc (FELIX 829).\nI have tried to submit articles on ICCA G on a number of occasions and have got steadily more\nand more fed up with being told that either I would have to collate, when collation takes place\nat the same time as the ICCA G Soup Run, or that\nyou might print it if there was space (which\ninvariably seems to happen).\nHaving chosen to spend most of this v ear treating ICCA G, and presumably other clubs, in\nthis high-handed manner it is too much to expect\nus to come running back with articles just because\nyou have decided that FELIX is looking a bit thin\nand needs some more pages whilst your regular\ncontributors get their revision done.\nYou have to make up your mind on clubs*\narticles and not expect clubs to put a lot of effort\nand time into a submission only to be told that\nit won't be printed or that they must spend more\ntime and effort collating for vo u. So do vo u want\nthem or not?\nYours sincerely.\nAlistair Goodall,\nICCAG Publicity Officer.\nPS. Wouldn't it be awfully funny if you came up\nwith some witty heading to this letter such as\nBoring, or even better don't print it due to lack\nof space.\nI'm sorry to hear that you have had problems\nwith your articles, why don't you call in and\ndiscuss it with me\u2014I don't bite. Most of the the\nproblems have arisen because we have been\nlacking a Clubs editor for the past term.\nJust for the record. Yes, we do ask people to\ncollate particularly if they submit late articles.\nI do not consider this unfair because many of\nour regular staff stay up until the early hours of\nthe morning on a regular basis to collate FELIX.\nThis is in addition to the work they put into\nwriting and laying out FELIX during the week,\ncons der ably more effort, I might add than it\ntakes to write a clubs article. Do you really think\nit unfair that we ask clubs who benefit from\nregular articles in FELIX to put something back\ninto the paper occasionally?\nEnraged\nD tw Bill,\nI would be very interested to find out who the\nselfish, thoughtless idiots were who organised\nthe carnival outside my room in the middle of\nmy final exams so that I can stand outside their\nroom playing deafening music and shouting at\nthe top of my voice at 3am in the middle of their\nexams.\nYours,\nEnraged Beit Hall Resident.\nPriorities\nDear Bill,\nThe students of the LSE have recently shown\nhow far ahead of us they really are. By voting\nWinston Silcott as their Honorary President last\nweek they recognised that he is a hero, a victim\nof the institutional is ed racism of our country.\nWhy can't ICU be more like LSE and stand up\nand fight for once, instead of contemplating its\nown navel? ICU should be campaigning on real\nstudent issues such as police brutality and their\noppression of the working classes, instead of\nmoaning on about so-called priorities such as bar\nprices or welfare. And what about homophobia?\nIt may be legal now (homosexuality, not\nhomophobia that is) but you try telling the police\nthat. Again where is ICU?\nIt is up to students to mobil is e to bring these\nissues into the open, yes even IC students.\nHillsborough again showed the Police in their\ntrue colours, an instrument of oppression. Where\ni^1CL'? \u2014at home looking after its own.\n)'our>.\nJames Nathan, Mech Eng 1.\nSatire lives\nDear Bill.\n1 low wonderful it is to see that the art of satire\nis not vet dead. That truly inspired piece 'Jesus\nVotes Tory' (issue 833) should be regarded as an\nall time classic and its author Dylan James (is that\na pseudonym?) placed in the satirists' hall of fame\nalongside such people as Swift and Stoppard.\nThis beautifully crafted piece combined all the\nclich es and false truths beloved of those on the\nfar right with the bland unthinking rhetoric of the\nworst of the evangelists and yet was so over the\ntop that it had to be regarded as a joke. Just think!\nIf ' Mr James' really believed all that he had\nwritten, it would be frightening. Perfect Satire!\nYours faithfully.\nlas on Lander.\nA mere facade\nDear Mr Goodwin,\nIn response to the article 'Jesus Votes Tory' of\n28.4.89 issue.\nThis is a matter which concerns both Christians\nand Non-Christians alike and about which we feel\nvery strongly. The main objection we have to this\narticle concerns the continual comparison\nbetween the welfare 'state' and charity. D James\nobviously fails to understand that we are the\nstate, and that the welfare state is publicly\nfunded. Whether or not individuals, over and\nabove taxes, choose to give money to charity, is\na matter of their own personal choice. The\nintroduction of the welfare state was surely proof\nthat we cannot rely solely on charity for the\nprovision of the basic necessities of life.\nCan we point out that the early Church 'held\neverything in common and all sold their land and\ngave the profits to the disciples to use for the good\nof the community'. Is this not a contradiction of\npr ovate ownership which is fundamental to the\nphilosophy of Toryism.\nThe serf-righteousness expressed by the writer\nis offensive not only to us, but also to those who\nare dependent on the welfare state for survival,\nand who do not wish to be seen merely as the\nrecipients of charity.\nIt seems that D James is using Christianity as\na mere facade in promoting his dangerous\npolitical beliefs, which we sincerely hope are\ncontrary to those held by most Christians.\nJulie Healer, Biology,\nBil Paxton, Biochemistry,\nKatherine Jones, Biology.\nPage 2 FELIX May 5 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nThe\nPlantagenets\nShakespearian historical soap\noperas have become fashionable\ntheatre entertainment. After the\nlavish seven-play history cycle\nstaged at the Old Vic earlier this\nv ear, which expunged the word\nanachronism' from every critic's pen; comes a more traditional, yet\nno less spectacular three-play\nextravaganza, reworked b v the RSC\nfrom Shakespeare's Henrv VI parts\nI, II, and III and Richard'III.\nThe plays spread a colourful\nlength of history. Illustrating a nation's collapse from prosperous\nstability and conquering patriotism,\nthrough the horrors of civil war, a reign of tyranny and on to a conclusion of harmonic optimism.\nIntricate webs of political intrigue\nare woven, and violent, bloody\nbattles are fought in this chronicle\nof a fascinating 65 year period in\nEnglish history.\nThree kings of starkly contrasting\ncharacter sit in turn upon the throne\nof England: Henry VI, a pious\nsaintly figure, ill-equipped to tackle\nthe politics of power; Edward IV, a lewd sensual is t; and Richard III, a crazed tv rant, full of malicious\nintent.\nHenry VI\nRalph Fiennes is superb as the\nuncertain, w impish Henry; a reluctant ruler proclaimed King at\nnine months old. As his realm is\nsplit b v war, intrigue and factions,\nhe seeks peace and consolation in\nreligious books and study. The\nmembers of his court vie for power;\nthe French army, headed by Joan of\nArc and the Dauphin, drive the\nEnglish out of France; and the feud\nbetween Lancaster and York\nintensifies, but Henry stands aloof\nand innocent as chaos unfolds\naround him.\nThe Rise of Edward IV\nMuch of the second play consists of\nscenes of military or civil warfare, as\nRichard of York strives for Henry's throne. The ruinous feuding of the\nnobility is parodied by a peasant\nrebellion led by the ribald Jack Cade,\nwho believes himself to be heir to\nthe crown.\nBattles ensue and fortunes\nmeander with dizzying intricacy.\nWe see elaborate displays of\nswirling flags, glittering armour,\nblood strewn fights and frenzied\nmotion. Unfortunately, the brutally\nunsettling battlefield scene in which\nQueen Margaret splatters York's face with the blood of his dead son\nis wasted in mayhem.\nAfter York's death his sons rally\nand defeat the Lancastrians, and so\nEdward, the eldest, becomes king.\nImmediately, the scene changes to\none of voluptuous frivolity, with a giant golden disc hanging over a court of loitering lovers. In amongst\nthis, the warped figure of Richard,\nEdward's brother, stands out as a soured misfit.\nRichard III, His Death\nThere is an obvious difference in\nstyle between this and the previous\nplays. The bombastic vertiginous\nevolution of the first two plays\ncontrast with a more subtle and\nemotive play on greed and tyranny,\nsignificant of a more mature bard.\nThe play opens with Richard in a drunken stupor, declaring ' Now is\nthe winter of our discontent made\nglorious by the son of York', an\ninteresting twist to the more\ntraditional opening.\nRichard schemes his way to the\ncrown. One by one his foes line up\nfor execution. One by one they exit\noffstage into a corridor of light to\nmeet the axe man's blade, as the\natmosphere becomes greyer and\nmore sinister with each of Richard's conquests.\nAnton Lesser is m esme rising as\nRichard. He is quirky, unpredictable\nand revels in his manipulations,\nderiving a genuine sadistic pleasure\nfrom his actions.\nAfter a particularly gruesome\ndeath scene for Richard, in which\none is left wondering whether the\nactor would rise for the curtain call,\nthe Earl of Richmond steps forward\nto take the throne and signal a new\nera of national unity and Tudor rule.\nAfter all the carnage and pageantry,\nthe cycle ends with simple\nunderstated ness. In general, the acting throughout\nthe production is of a very high\nstandard, although lesser roles are\nnot as memorable as the 'War of the\nRoses' series. There is no Michael\nPennington or Sion Probert injecting\nlife into a minor character.\nPenny Down ie as Queen Margaret is the one link through all\nthe plays. Her degeneration from\nsexy young queen, to power hungry\nbitch, to ranting senile woman is\nimpressively convincing.\nInspired set and costume design,\nas well as Adrian Noble's flamboyant and confident direction,\npull the production together into a glorious tapestry of Shakespearean\ndrama; although nine hours may be\na bit too much.\nThe Plantagenets continues at the\nBarbican until July 3rd, with the\nwhole trilogy played every Saturday\nuntil then. Ticket prices start at \u00a36\nper play.\nSuniif Guha.\n'Too damn right I 've got the hump!'\nVIDEO\nHigh Spirits\nIn the heart of the Emerald Isle lies\nCastle Plunkett, majestic and masterful, ancient and knacker ed. The hotel, as the building purports\nto be, is empty and under threat of\na take-over from an American who\nwishes to transport the castle to\nVlalibu and make a theme park of it.\nIn a desperate move to save his\nhome, Peter Plunkett( Peter\nO 'Toole) advertises the place as a haven for ghosts, and is then treated\nto a party of American tourists, a mixed bunch including a nymphomaniac with desires on a young\npriest, and a parapsychologist and\nfamily.\nThe castle staff employ themselves in a bungling series of\nghostly fakes and completely fail to\nimpress the guests, including the\nkids. Didn't you ever see Nightmare\non Elm Street? The castle is doomed.\nThe real ghosts meanwhile decide\nto do something about this\u2014they\ndon't want to live in California.\nWhile they create mayhem amongst\nthe staff and visitors alike, a couple\nof love-hate relationships are\nbecoming mixed up in the\nbackground.

    "content": "Science\nIf Fleischmann and Pons are right and cold fusion\nis possible \u2014 what, asks Tony Spencer, will be\nthe consequences?\nCheap, clean and\ndoomed?\n-\"Neutron dance\"\nSCIENCE\nThe recent claims for the discovery\nof fusion at room temperature by\nDrs. Pons and Fleischmann raise\nsome interesting questions about\nthe future, assuming the claims\nprove to be justified.\nIf what they have found is indeed\nfusion, or even a new form of\nchemical energy, then the potential\nbenefits for mankind could be\nenormous. The process seems to\nproduce no unwanted by-products\nsuch as carbon monoxide, carbon\ndioxide, or long-term radioactivity.\nLarge scale use of this new form of\nenergy would be a lifesaver for the\necology of the planet, giving us a real chance to reverse the damage\nalready done to the environment.\nIt seems that we could be at the\ndawn of a new age of cheap power,\nsomething that would not only help\nthe development of the third world,\nbut would also help reduce the\nAmerican budget deficit. It would\nsee domestic and commercial\nenergy bills cut drastically to the\nbenefit of both rich and poor.\nClearly such a new source is\nessential if the Third World is to\ndevelop to anywhere near Western\nliving standards. Last year America,\nwith about a twentieth of the\nWorlds population accounted for\n43% of the World's oil consumption\n- there is simply not enough fuel\navailable for the rest of the World to\nlive like this.\nDr Hag el stein of the\nMassachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT) has already\napplied quantum mechanics to cold\ndeuterium fusion. He claims it may\nbe possible to produce fusion driven\nlasers, small fusion generators,\nreverse fusion (What! - Science Ed.)\nand new exotic fusion reactions. The\nidea of suitcase sized power stations\nmay be exciting, but the real\nrevolution would be small portable\nfusion generators.\nProvided that such generators\nwere small enough, say the size of\nan internal combustion engine or\nless, and were relatively cheap to\nmake and service (presumably\nheavy water and palladium and\nplatinum electrodes are not that\nexpensive), it is conceivable that\nthey could be self-contained, with\na solar panel to provide the initial\n'push'. With a life expectancy in\nexcess of twenty of thirty years,\nsuch generators would be essential\nfor the rapid development of the\nThird world, enabling power to be\navailable cheaply, and without\ntransport costs or problems with the\nfuel supply. This, coupled with the\nenvironmental benefits, make it a very attractive proposition.\nAs with any new radical idea,\nwhether or not it gains widespread\nacceptance largely depends on vested interests. Cold fusion could\ndestroy some industries. Oil companies would probably suffer\nmost, along with gas and electricity\ngenerating companies. The internal\ncombustion engine could become as\noutdated as the steam engine, and\nthere is the danger that a lot of\nEngineering jobs could be lost and\nequipment made redundant.\nLarge corporations wield a lot of\npower and influence, and it is\npossible that these organisations\nmay seek to inhibit the development\nof such a revolutionary idea. As with the everlasting light bulb and\nrust-proof stainless steel cars,\nmultinationals are likely to buy up\nthe patent and sit on it, smothering\nthe development of a new idea.\nWith so much at stake, there is a real\nlikelihood that there would be major\nopposition to the widespread\ndevelopment of this new fusion\nprocess.\nFor better or worse, in order for\nthis new technology to see the light\nof day, we may have to encourage\noil companies and other affected\nparties to develop and commercial is e the fusion process\nthemselves, allowing them to\ndiversify. With care, this could be\nhandled to everyone's satisfaction:\nthe new applications could be\ndeveloped and the oil companies\ncould use their stocks for essential\nchemicals.\nFailure to take these implications\ninto account may result in the\ntechnology being ' stillborn', leaving the Third World, Mankind\nand the ecology of the planet back\nat square one, with the continued\nsquandering of resources and the\nworld taking a step backwards\nrather than a leap ahead.\nTony Spencer\nSPORT\nOSC FOOTBALL\nCyprus v India\nThe inter-society indoor Football\nTournament organised by the OS C ended last term with the Cvpriots\nbeating the Indians 19-5 in a convincing finals victory. Although\nthe match was one-sided right from\nthe beginning, the Indians put up\na gallant effort. Nevertheless, the\nskills of the reigning champions\nproved to be too much for the\nIndians.\nEarlier, in the semifinals, the\nIndians overpowered the AfroCaribbeans 11-8, while the Cvpriots\nentered the finals b v beating the\nItalians 14-12.\nIn total 9 societies took part in this\nevent. Apart from the Chinese and\nthe Sri Lankan societies, which\ndidn't even bother to turn up for\ntheir matches, the teams put in\ntremendous efforts and snowed\nmuch anticipation and eagerness.\nDespite the high standards\ndisplayed each of the participating\nteams this year, there can however\nbe only one.single winner, and the\nCypriots yet again emerged as the\nchampions.\nTENNIS\nStart of\nSeason Thrills\nThe tennis season is upon us (so\nplease tell the weather!), and it is\nnot too late to join IC Lawn Tennis\nClub.

Hundreds of\nothers were unable to attend\nbecause of shortage of space.\nThe lecture was the second of the\nSchrodinger Lectures, named in honour of the quantum mechanics\npioneer, and was chaired by the\nRector, Professor Eric Ash. Professor Hawking, who is\nconfined to a wheelchair and is\nseverly disabled makes use of a computerised speech synthesizer.\nProfessor Hawking said that the\nsynth is er give him an 'accent' which\nhad been described variously as\nAmerican, Scandinavian or Irish.\nHe is probably best known as the\nwriter of the scientific best-seller ' A Brief History of Time' which has\ntopped both the British and American best-seller lists and been\ntranslated into 22 languages.\nProfessor Hawking said that he\nknew the book was a sucess when\nhe heard that it had been translated\ninto Servo-Croat.\nIn the lecture the Professor\ndescribed the theory that time may\nnot be a simple 'linear' quantity\nmoving steadily from a beginning to\nan end, but two quantities, the 'real'\ntime we measure or think we\nmeasure and an unobservable\n'imaginary time'. By travelling in imaginary time we may be able to\ntravel into the future or back into the\npast of our own universe and even\ninto other so-called par elle l universes.

Work on\nthe Biochemistry tower is due to\nbegin within a month, followed by\nthe Mechanical Engineering tower; .\nAUTEGM\nThe extremely short and not\nparticularly well attended EG M held\nv ester day, discussed just three\nmotions supplied by Union President Nigel D Baker.\nThe first of these dealt with Union\npolicy towards the AUT action\nwhich supported their aims but\ncriticised their policy of not marking\nexam papers.

Nigel\nwill write letters to the Committee\nof Vice Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP), the AUT and the Rector\ndetailing the new stance of ICU towards the AUT, and condemning\nthe CVC P for withdrawing from the\nnegotiation process.\nCourse changes were covered in the second motion especially\nGeology courses which have been\nchanged from the description given\nin the College Prospectus.

She expressed sympathy\nwith student examine es but added\n'if you students had only a one year\ncontract for a job and a family, you would probably feel just as\ndesperate.'\nLondon Transport described the\nNUR s' action as ' somewhat stubborn' and has gained a High\nCourt injunction to prevent the\nstrike.\nThe departments and years that\nwill be affected are: Maths I, Geology (Mining) I, Geology II and\nIII, Mineral Resources Engineering\n(Petroleum Engineering II, Hi and\nIV), Electrical Engineering III and IV\nand Chemical Engineering III and\nIV.\nCiv Eng students angry\nIrate second year Civil Engineering\nstudents claimed they had been\n'messed around' this week when\nthe Civ Eng department rescheduled an exam that had been postponed by the AUT strike.\nStudents were given only eight\ndays notice of the exam when they\nreturned from the Easter break. This\nis despite assurances that the exam\nwould not be held in May and that\nthere would be two weeks notice of\nthe date.\nA petition calling for the exam to\nbe boycotted was signed by about\neighty per cent of the class.\nStudents approached Union Honorary Secretary, Ian Morris on\nTuesday, calling for the exam to be\ncancelled. Mr Morris and Union\nPresident, Nigel Baker ICU conducted a straw poll amongst Civ\nEng II later in the week and were\ntold that the exam should be\ncanceled. If this was not possible,\nsaid the students, they would like\nthe exam to go ahead on the original\ndate rather than have it interfere\nwith the rest of their exams.\nThe Head of Section, Mr Chiat,\nwas not prepared to cancel the test,\nbut agreed to provide sample\nquestions. He said the standard of\nthe exam was easier than in previous years, and agreed to\nrelease the distribution curves from\nthis year and last year so that\nstudents could be sure they were\nbeing fairly treated.\nMr Sharma, one of the lecturers\nresponsible for the course, told\nFELIX that the exam was only part\nof the course and that success in the\ncourse was not dependent upon\npassing it. He claimed that students\nhad been provided with three\nunscheduled hours of help in the\nweek before the exam. He went on\nto say that the date had been set in\nconsultation with the Civ Eng Dep\nRep and said that the exam would\nhave been too close to the main\nexams had 15 days notice been\ngiven.\nStudents in the department said\nafter the exam that it was 'a pathetic\nexam, set out of a bloody-minded\ndesire to have an exam at all costs'\nand that they 'should have asked for\nthe exam mark to be reduced as a proportion of the course'.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7\n2BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

    "content": "Growl, Roar!\nNews/Feature\nA prehistoric friend visits South Kensington\nCarnival Mayhem\nCrazy\nThe Union building was packed as\nfull as fire regulations would allow\nwith an estimated 1200 students\npresent at the Carnival last Friday.\nThe event made a \u00a3200 loss which\nIan Morris, the Union Hon Sec,\nclaims was predicted before the\nevent.\nThere were three bands, and a variety of comedy acts performing.\nThe first band to open was Stop\nlaughing; a concoction of heavy\nmetal guitars with weak-sounding\nvocals. The audience judged the\nband by emptying the hall rapidly.\nFollowing this were the comedy\nacts, which were not well received;\nthere were shouts of obscenities\nthroughout most of the\nperformances. One comedian was\nnarrowly missed by a full beer-can\nthrown by a member of the\naudience.\nThe other bands were The\nButterfield 8, a rhythm and blues\nband, which produced some good\ndance music, and Bad Manners; a band with a style of their own.\nThere was some doubt as to how\nlong Bad Manners would be playing,\nsince they walked off the stage\nrefusing to continue after they were\nprevented by the Dramatic Society\nfrom taking a bucket of water onto\nthe stage. After a small pause the\nband took their places back on the\nstage; without the bucket of water.\nThere were objections on the\ngrounds that the carnival might\nThe Summer is\nApproaching\nand you have to wear a swimming costume\nDON'T PANIC!\nOn Mondavs, starting 8th Mav, there will he a ladies on lv session at the Multigvm; from 7.45 to\n8.45pm. An intro duct or v course will be given\nduring the first two sessions.\nPop into the Sports Centre tor more info.\nThis Easter, the Natural History\nMuseum opened an exhibition\ncalled 'Dinosaurs Live!'. As the title\nsuggests, the display is supposed to\nconvey the impression of being in\nthe presence of some long dead\ncreatures, which have been\nmysteriously brought back to life.\nThis amounts to a cross between a history programme, and a prehistoric chamber of horrors.\nThe atmosphere is rather\nimpressive; there are jungle noises,\ndimmed green lights and the odd\nplastic palm. The 'Dinosaurs' are in\nsmall enclosures, from which they\ntower impressively over the human\nform. The larger dinosaurs are built\nto half scale, but even so, the\nTyrannosaurus manages to leer\ndown quite successfully.\nThe creatures are built from a metal framework, and are driven by\ncompressed air. This is all covered\nby a convincing rubber skin, upon\nwhich is modelled the features of\nthe dinosaur, as guessed at by\nscientists everywhere. The heads\n(including eyes) and a few other\nparts of the dinosaurs' anatomy are\nanimated, moving to the commands\nof a preset program. These\nsequences have been well designed;\nthe dinosaurs look down to the\nplace where people are most likely\nto stand, and although this is not\nexactly frightening it is, to say the\nleast, unnerving.\nHowever, there are drawbacks to\nthe display. Since the automated\nhave an adverse effect on examinations. One finalist\ncommented, T had had two exams\nthat day and was feeling a bit\nknacker ed'. He said that he had\nbeen unable to sleep, adding that he\nhad also had an examination on the\nTuesday following the carnival.\nAnother student living in Beit said,\neven though he had attended and\nenjoyed the carnival, 'Nobody slept\non this landing that night'.\nIan Morris replied to this by\nsaying that a questionnaire asking\nwhether people would object to the\ncarnival had been put under ail\nresidential doors in Beit Hall, asking\nif there were any objections to the\ncarnival taking place. This was\ncirculated prior to Easter, and there\nwere no objections to the event\ntaking place. Ian Morris assured\nFELIX that the carnival would have\nbeen cancelled if there had been any\nobjections beforehand, but none\nwere received.\nmetal skeletons are powered by\ncompressed air, there is an audible\nhiss whenever an v part of the\ndinosaurs move. This is with the\nsole exception of their eyes; they\nclick whenever the dinosaur casts a quick glance in either direction.\nHowever., their main fault,\noccurring only with the larger\nskulled models, is that their heads\nare too heavy. Whenever the head\nstops moving, it seems to do so too\nquickly, because there is a significant wobble whenever they\ncome to rest.\nOn the press day, there was an\nadded attraction, which will not be\njoining the rest of the display; an\neight foot tall walking Tyrannosaurus Rex. Unfortunately,\nthis dinosaur was not of the robotic\nkind. Instead, it consisted of a man\ninside a rather sturdy inflatable\nrubber suit. This, to the press, was\nmuch more interesting than the\ndisplay, and the organisers had to\nthreaten to take it away, to bring the\njournalists and photographers back\nto the display.\nThe exhibition also has many\nspin-offs; there is a dinosaur shop\nsituated next-door which, if not built\nspecifically for the occasion, will\ncertainly benefit from the increased\nenthusiasm in dinosaurs.\nAltogether, 1 would say that the\ndisplay is an interesting part of the\nmuseum and admission is free in\nthe last hour so it is well worth a look.\nPrince Philip\n(nearly) visits\nICU Carnival\nLast Friday, as students were\nstarting to turn up for the Carnival,\nsecurity cordoned off the Sherfield\nBuilding in readiness for the arrival\nof Prince Philip, the Duke of\nEdinburgh. The Prince was attending the annual dinner of the\nBritish Antartic Society held in the\nStaff Senior Common Room.\nIn a joint s ecu it y operation\nbetween the Royalty Protection\nsquad, the local police and ICs own\nsecurity staff: the doors to Sherfield\nwere locked and a number of\npolicemen patrolled the college.\nSecurity Chief, Geoff Reeves, said\nlater that the security arrangements\nwent 'very smoothly'.\nPage 4 FELIX May 5 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nBlackmail The nice people from 'Time Out' decided to present FELIX with a bottle\nof champagne at the end of last term. The champagne is currently in the\npossession of Ruth Benzimra, the ULU President. An irate Ruth rang up\nyesterday and threatened to drink the champagne if I did not make the\nfollowing correction to the news story entitled 'Angry' which appeared\nin last weeks issue.\nRuth would prefer the paragraph which read 'The ULU exec has decided\nnot to publicise the demonstration' to read 'Members of the ULU exec\ndecided not to publicise the demonstration.'\nShe would also like us to point out that she is the ULU President, not\nthe acting ULU President...Can we have our champagne back now?\nCongratulations To Ramin Nakisa for completing the Alternative Prospectus. He has done\nan excellent job.\nLeafing through the offical prospectus it becomes apparent how\nimportant it is to present a students-eye view to prospective\nundergraduates. When it comes down to it, the pro sect us is little more\nthan a glossy recruitment brochure complete with colour enhanced\nphotographs. It glosses over many of the problems which students will\nbe likely to face at Imperial.\nThe Alternative Prospectus is not there to dissuade students, but it is\nthere to let them know exactly what they are letting themselves in for.\nTake the accommodation costs for example. The Official Prospectus\nlists the current accommodation prices but ignores the fact that\naccommodation costs will have increased by \u00a310 a week when the\nstudents actually reach Imperial. This misleading presentation of\ninformation is grossly unfair to prospective students.\nIn many ways the Alternative Prospectus is not independent enough\nfrom the College. Currently departmental articles are vetted by the Staff\nStudent Committee. It is reasonable that Departments should check articles\nfor factual accuracy, but the problem with using the Staff Student\nCommittee as a forum is that the Departmental Reps are forced to be very\ncareful what they write. It takes a lot of guts to submit an article which\nis anything other than one hundred percent praiseworthy when you know\nthat the academics you are presenting the article to will also decide what\nlevel of degree you will be given.\nWeather\nWhat nice weather we have been having recently. It's so nice to be able\nto sit in the sun and not worry about exams. In fact it's so nice that I think\nI 'll cut this editorial short and go back to sleep.\nThanks to Stef Smith, Ramin Nakisa, Liz Warren, Tony Spencer, Adam\nHarrington, Andy Clarke and Sumit, Rose and Dean, Jason Lander, Gary\nHastings and Michael McCarthy, Marge, Penny Gamble, the colla tors, and\neveryone I have forgotten.\nDOV OU HAVE EXAMS NEXT WEEK?

    "content": "Travel\n^INDEPENDENT\nELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER T RAV \u2022Cycling in India\nGary Hastings and Malcolm\nMcCarthy spend three months\ncycling in India.\nWe spent a week in Dehli preparing\nand planning our trip and set out on\na hot and humid November morning, with only a vague idea of\nwhere we were going. Our only aim\nwas to experience the splendour of\nthe Indian Himalayas.\nIt took twenty minutes for the first\nproblem of the tour to arise: I had\na puncture and we were in a crowded bazaar on the outskirts of\nDehli.\nA crowd started to gather as soon\nas we stopped. The crowd grew to\nat least 200 people and children\npushed their way to the front only\nto be ejected by adults wishing to\nwitness the spectacle.\nThe 'crowd' is a characteristic of\nurban living in India. It's like living\nyour whole life in a crowded\nLondon tube station. There is no such thing as privacy or personal\nspace.\nThe traffic on the highway was\nchaotic but colourful. Every\nconceivable mode of transportation\nwas on the road: rickshaws, carts,\ndonkeys, dogs and cows.\nThe only rule on the Indian\nhighways is.if it's bigger than you,\nget out of the way. Since the\nhighway has only one lane, smaller\nvehicles are regularly forced off the\nroad into the dust tracks on either\nside of the highway.\nIt wasn't long before we were\nunceremoniously dumped in the\ndust and, since the dust seemed to\nbe littered with razor sharp thorns,\nwe were soon -repairing more\npunctures.\n\u2022 Tourist buses regularly drive\nlorries off the road and all along the\nroute one can see overturned lorries,\ntheir cargoes strewn everywhere.\nUnperturbed drivers can often be\nseen relaxing amongst the wreckage\nand consuming the cargo (if it's edible), presumably waiting for help\nto arrive. We could not envisage the\nsame tranquility being shown by a driver on the Ml suffering a similar\nfate.\nAt midday, the heat of the plains\nis unbearable, so we decided to pull\ninto adha ba for much needed\nrefreshments.\nInitially we had planned to cook\nour own food but it didn't take us\nlong to appreciate the convenience,\nnot to mention the excellent food,\nof the d hab as which were littered\nalong the highways.\nThis d hab a was far from the\ncleanest we had ever seen; the\nnormally app et ising Indian sweets\nwere covered by a layer of flies and\nwasps. Dust covered everything\nelse, including the owners of the\nestablishment who were squatting\non a clay ledge which housed an\noven fuelled by slabs of dried dung.\nUndaunted we entered and were\nintroduced to the delicious\nbeverage: chai. Geared to the very\nsweet tooth, the beverage is\nprepared by endlessly boiling\nbuffalo milk, water, tea and copious\namounts of sugar. Our enthusiasm\nfor the concoction and its energy\ngiving qualities were immense. We\ndowned five cups immediately and,\nstill thirsty, we tried some camp a cola (India's answer to Coca-Cola).\nWe pulled into the 'Red Robin'\nlodge near Sinipat at the end of the\nfirst day. These lodges are all named\nafter birds and litter the highways\nof the Harayana.\nWe set out early the following\nmorning and, after stopping to\nrepair another puncture, we reached\nPani put which, according to\nMoslem legend, is the most fly\ninfested area in all India.\nWe stopped at adha ba and left\nthe crowds to ponder over our\nmountain bikes. Usually, in such\nsituations, there is an on-hand\nexpert to explain the finer\nspecifications to the, exclusively\nmale, audience. These 'experts'\nassume the right to touch, prod and\ntinker with whatever takes their\nfancy without considering to ask\nyou if it's okay. This particular\nexpert pointed knowingly to our\nwater bottles and said, 'petrol!'.\nSoon we reached Karma Lake\nlodge ten miles outside of Kamal.\nThe chow k idar tried to convince me\nthe place was full even though it\nwas obviously empty. Politeness\nwas not going to sway this man's mind but when I threatened to write\nto the Harayana Tourist Board we\nwere offered a tool shed behind the\nlodge. After inspecting the shed I decided that going back to Karmal\nwas by far the more attractive of the\ntwo choices.\nMeanwhile, Malcolm had made\nfriends with an engineer who took\na great interest in our bikes. This\nman seemed to have a magical\ncontrol over the chow k idar and,\nwith a wave of - his hand, had managed to secure us a room and\nfor chai to be brought immediately.\nThis type of incident was not\nuncommon; whenever we were\ndown, someone always came along\nand provided us with invaluable\nhelp. People were forever asking us\nif we required their assistance.\nIndeed, all one had to do was look\nat a map in a public place and aid\nwas immediately offered without\nhaving to ask.\nDespite the inaccuracy of our\nIndian maps, we found the turning\nfor Nahan and thus began our\njourney around the edge of the\nPunjab and into the mountains...\nEnd of part I, part 2 next week.\nSheep blockage on road to Shimla.\nPage8 FELIX ; l Mav 5 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Italian delights\nFELIX culinary expert, Yishu Nanda continues his\ngastronomic exploration of Italy. This week Yishu\nsamples the delights of Milan and Verona and brings you\nthe recipes for two authentic Italian pasta dishes.\nA selection of cured meats.\nPart 3\nFine food in a Milan home\nThe Italians have a profound love\nfor their food. Even in Milan the\nfast city lifestyle cannot detract\nfrom a proud display of cooking at\nhome. I hope to give you a flavour\nof the casa linga that one could\nexpect to enjoy.\nStaying with the Rossies in Milan\nwas an opportunity to see how the\nlovers of food tread the compromise\nbetween enjoying food and a fast\nlifestyle in which both husband and\nwife work. 1 cannot enjoy good food\nwithout giving some in return, so I took three home-made fruit cakes\nwith me to present to friends in\nItaly.\nOn Saturday morning I accompanied them to a street\nmarket to buy the cheeses, cured\nmeats, vegetables, fruits just as 1 do\nin Chapel market in Islington. They\nbought some Parmigiano, pecorino (an\newes milk cheese), font in a, mozzarella, scam orz a, ricotta cheeses.\nThe ricotta cheese must be enjoyed\nas fresh as possible and was bought\nto be consumed at lunch that day.\nThe cured or cooked meats were\nalso bought in generous\nproportions. We chose to get s pek Tyrolese, prosciutto crude, salami and\nsome pan c etta. The cheese and meat\nproducts are not inexpensive, but\nthe v give the Italians the flexibility\nto feed themselves and their guests\nconveniently. I was to discover that\nwherever I went the Italians would\noffer a platter ladd en with razor thin\nslices of the cured meats, another\nwith the cheeses on proud display\nand a basket of bread.\nA simple salad such as tomatoes\nand capers in an olive oil and lemon\njuice dressing would also be passed\naround.\nThe home cooking that I enjoyed\nin Milan included a simple fu sill i pasta flavoured with butter and\ncinnamon. The tim ballo( macaroni\nbaked in be chamel sauce, tomatoes,\nblack olives) is an impressive pasta\ndish when brought piping hot from\nthe oven to the table. I also admired\na simple dish of red peppers cooked\nin tomatoes, onions, garlic and\nherbs. It is rare that peppers are\nenjoyed on their own.\nThe Rossi family also provided a display of cooking which requires ali tte more effort. A visit to Milan\nwould not be complete without\ntrying a risotto Milanese so it was\nprepared for me. There was also the\ntort a salat a, a pie made from spinach,\nmozzarella, font in a,p arnie gian no, eggs\nand nutmeg.\nI also enjoyed a spaghetti al pesto.\nThe pesto is a sauce made from\ngarlic, basil and pine nuts. The\nRossies make it a few times a year.\nIt is frozen and used a little at a time.\nAnother successful way of enjoying\nflavour some sauces without the toil.\nServe the spaghetti pesto with\nground pecorino cheese as the\nGenovese do.\nNo trip to Italy is complete\nwithout a trip to a wine cellar. I had\nthe opportunity to visit the en otec a Limbardi delta Certosa di Pavia near the\nCertosa monas tr v in Pavia. The reds\nSome Recipes\nCRESCENTINE\n350gr white wheat flour\n1.5 wine glasses of water\n25gr yeast\nItsp sunflower oil\nh tsp salt\nMethod:\nMake the dough and leave it covered in\na warm place for Vi hour. Roll out apple\nsize balls into face size oval discs.\nShallow fry on a medium flame for\nseveral minutes, turning a few times,\nuntil both fide s are cooked.\nZelina spoke of the revival of the use\nof chestnuts in the cuisine. She gave\nme her recipe to make castagna c cio, a cake made from chestnut flour.\nDuring the Second World War the\ncastagna c cio was eaten as a bread\nbecause chestnut flour was available\nmuch more easily than wheat flour.\nCASTAGNO C CIO chestnut flour\nlOC l gr milk\nSome salt an as Some pin nuts\n':tsp baking powder\n2tb ls cocoa powder '\nMethod:\nBake for hour at 165\"C or until\ncooked. After it has cooled pour some\nliquor over the cake.\nFood\nproduced in this region are\nconsidered to be better than the\nwhites.\nEating out in Milan\nI recommend going to the La\nSpaghetteria di Via Solferino, 3 Via\nSolferino (Tel. 872735). The chef\nprepares a sauce which is served\nwith spaghetti. Everyone is offered\na small bowl of the pasta and the\nsurprise sauce. If the sauce does not\ntempt you then you can wait for the\nsauce of the next round. One can\ncarry on eating for as many rounds\nas one likes. The meal for everyone\nat the table is offered free if any\nindividual can break the record\nnumber of rounds of spaghetti\nconsumed. I think the record stands\nat about 45. The portion offered in\neach round is not large so that one\ncan sample as many sauces as\npossible.\nPart 4\nA taste of Verona\u2014Veronesi\ntutti matt i! The ' mad' Veronese pride\nthemselves for their Peru and\nPolenta.\nI saw the pole nt a made in the\ntraditional way. The coarse ground\nmaize was continuously stirred by\narm for about half an hour as it\nabsorbed the boiling liquid. It was\nserved in the shape of a mound on\na wooden platter. Slices of the\npole nt a were served with a sauce\nmade from porc in i mushrooms. In\nVerona they also eat it with thin\nslices of salami and gorgonzola\ncheese. A good pole nt a should be\nmoist but firm. A good texture of\nfinish can only be achieved with\nyears of cooking experience.\nThe mushroom sauces that\npervade\" Italian casa linga are the\nfinest. Often the mushrooms have\nbeen hand-picked in the near b v woodland. I was shown some\nwhole porc in i mushrooms which\nhad been sealed individually for\nfreezing. Alternatively, the\nmushrooms are sliced and dried.\nMy thanks to Eleo Arrighi for\npresenting me with a packet of his\nhandpicked, home dried mushrooms.\nThe pera, a favourite in the local\ncuisine, is a sauce made from\nadding bread crumbs to a broth\ncontaining marrows. It is served in\ngenerous proportions to accompany\nboll it om is to( slow cooked meats) and\nvegetables.\nI would like to thank the Rossies,\nArrighies and Zullos for making this\ntour a great success.\nMay 5 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
