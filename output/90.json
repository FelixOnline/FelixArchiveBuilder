Then\nfollowed 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' by the conductor's father. The\nsinging during this first half la oke d spirit and, until they\nwarn wd up, the sopranos were \u00bb little weak*\nNot so the second half, wh i oh was a great ImpSoromaot.\nA shortened version of Puroall's 'King Arthur' was swig with\nlife and it was-apparent ths* the choir, as well as She audie n of j enjoyed the seo on d far more than the first half. In fact, so\ngood wmi the shivering so ene, that someone decided As was coU U Of the soloists Kay Poster was exo ellen t and Shirley Walker was\nvery o lear on her top notes. At the end of the nono ert Janet\nWalsby (president I.C. Mus. Soc.) presented Miss Hoist with a large bouquet.\nVICTORIANA\ni lie spirit of the 'Music Hall', the w ioke d villi an of\nthe melodrama, the Victorian ballad, are all things of a bye gone age, all stock characters \"which to us reflect that\nage. To revive them, to make them live again, however\nrequires above all, an infinite amount of 'gusto'.\nJudging by results, the gusto wh i oh members of the\nDramatic Society and Musical Society gave to 'Victoriana'\non Monday 19th march in Ayrton Hall must have been infinite.\nThe audience was treated to a grand mixture of, melo-drama, complete with hisses and boos, Victorian music, a mime with a narration in vor se which can only be described\nas ghastly, quartets from Gilbert and Sullivan, and sundry\nother items in the form of songs and monologues. All of\nthese were strung together by a chairman in''true Victorian\nstyle.\nThe longest single item on the bill was a one act\nplay \"Hiss the Villain\", which was produced by Derek Hill\nwho did very well earlier in the evening in a short\nsketch. To single out other individuals from this very :\npleasant evening would only be unfair to the others, but\nJudy Kornbluth is to be congratulated for her work as\norganiser in oh i ef. No eon fid fl n ce in ( tarsus Policy\nThe U.L. TJ. Photographic Exhibition was on view in the Union\nin Malet St. during the last week. There were 531 entries from\n18 Colleges! and Hospitals. It is a great pity that there was\nnot a room large enough to house them all,,consequently anyone\nwishing to view them all had to wander all over the \"Building,\nsometimes without the aid of the 14ft, yet still miss some in\nan obscure corner.\nThe I.C. photographers, going\nstraight from their own exhibition\ntook one first and three third prizes\nin the four sections. They also ent\nered seven photographs wh i oh were\namong the twenty-eight highly o cm mended. These results were roughly in\nproportion to the number of I.C, entries as they contributed about one\nthird of the total.\nIt is interesting to note that\nIn some cases the winners\nin the I.C. competition staw placed lower than prints which\nthey had beaten there. This shorn how the opinion of the judges\nvaries and points to ths fact that their judgement must he based\nen their likes and dislikes to a certain extent, and not pw reS jr on photographic \u2014\nTHE UNION DEBATE.\nThe mot ian of the Union Debate held on\n13th. March was: \"This house has no Confidence in the Government's handling of Foreign and Colonial Affairs.\" Jua_ interesting debate was opened by Aidan\nCrawley, speaking for the motion. It was followed-by the speaker for the opposition, The Hon.\nPatrick Maitland M.P., whose ability as a speaker\nwas shown in the masterly manner in which he handled the lively audience. The two I.C. speakers\nfollowed, .with John Bingham for the motion and\nTerry Smith against.\". Their speeches were of a high standard, like the subsequent ones delivered\nfrom the floor. In fact the outside debaters were\nimpressed with the standard of I.C. debates.\nThe popularity of the motion was shown by the\nvoting at the end with 85 votes for the notion,\n34 against with 13 abstentions. These figures do\nnot reflect the number of the audience as many\nleft before 3 p.m. Mr. Les Allen( The President\nof I.C.L it. and Deb. Soc.) is to be congratulated\non the high quality of debates held this year.\nRailway Society Excursion\nThe Railway Society.\nThe Railway Society recently visited the Long- .\nmoor Military Railway at Liss, Hants., In a train furnished with carpets and armchairs, they made a conducted tour of the line, with various in t eruptions to erect step signs across the roads - there was\neven a corporal with a red flag. At Longmoor downs the it i nery included the\nGarrison Church, the Naafi for lunch, and the au aue tv Them followed visits to the loco shed, where those\nwith cameras took full advantage of the sun and the\nabsence of smoke and polish, and the signal school,\nwhere shining brass told a tale. From the models\non to the signal box, and then back to the train. There were anxious moments as it reversed over the\nhalf completed track (not a monorail), but Liss was\nduly returned to, with several members riding the\nengine.\nk. General impressions of the visit were that\nLongmoor is a train-wreckers paradise - many filmed\ntrain crashes that have occurred there, although\nthe Society did not actually witness one.\nOther activities of the Society this year have\nincluded works visits and talks, ranging from discussions on Tube brakes to revision of the best in swim wear advertisements. For the future, a long\ndistance visit to the Manchester-Sheffield electrified main line has been arranged, and will include\na brake-van trip, and the annual Dinner will doubtless follow the customary pattern.\n. Touchstone Weekend.\nEducation was*the subject of the last Touchstone Weekend, which was held on the 1 0 - ll th March.\nThe guest speaker, Mr. Sylvester, the Chief Educational Officer for Bristol, discussed the social implications of our present educational system,\nparticularly the effect of now trends. Examples\nquoted included decentralisation, modern comprehensive schools, and group methods of teaching\ninvolving discussion and research.\nTwo informal discussion groups then considered\n\u00aba \u00bb philosophical aspect of the 'subject. An attempt\nwaa made to define the meaning and aims of education.\nIs was regretted that modern education tends to concentrate upon the acquisition of specific knowledge with the consequent neglect of the wider\naspects of life.

O This photograph of a line-out was taken\nduring the Cup final from the touch line where sixty I.C. supporters gathered to en cu u rage their team.\nThe match began with considerable pressure by\nU.C., who missed a reasonable chance of a penalty\ngoal. Play was forced back to the U.C. half and\nI.C. were awarded a free kick on the ten-yard line, about ten yards in from touch. Hearn produced one\nof his finest long-range kicks and the ball sailed over the bar. Not long afterwards U.C. were penal i zed for obstruction almost in front of the posts,\nabout twenty-five yards out, and Hearn increased\nI.C.'s lead to six points.\nDuring the first twenty minutes of the second\nha lf I.C. played magnificently, and several times\ncame near scoring a try. Towards the end of the\ngame the tl.C. forwards began to take control and\nheavy pressure was maintained on the I. C.line: however, the defence held out and I.C. had won\nthe coveted trophy.\nFirst words of praise must go to the captain,\nBrian Corbett, a rugged and tough front row for ward, whose enthusiasm has fired the team into many\nfine performances during the season. Heroes of the\nmatch itself, apart from Oggi, were the two centres,\nHolman and Ooncaster. Doncaster covered superbly in defence : on more than one occasion he was there to snatch the ball from U.C. within a few yards of the\nI. C.line and set up a counter-attack which carried\nplay into the U.C. half. The psychological effect\nof such sudden reversals in fortune on the U.C. forwards must have been considerable. Holman, playing\nin his eighteenth cup match for I.C., was solid and\nassured, imbued a feeling of confidence in all the\nbacks. He has played in all four winning finals. The four fresher s in the side - Stone, Wright, Gibbons\nand Dingle-all covered themselves with glory. Cup\nnerves were cons pi cio us by their absence, and all the\nforwards f* ugh t themselves to a stands till,, I.C. has established itself as\neasily the leading rug ger college in U.L. Not only does it run six teams,,\nall with strong and attractive fixture lists, but its Cup record is out stand ing. In the last seven years the\nheaviest Cup defeat has been 0-3 by\nthe Vets, in1950 s. During this period 21 cup matches have been played\nof which 16 have been won, 2 drawn and\n3 lost. i;C. have scored 203 points\nto their opponents 44. This year\n63 points have been amassed without\nreply, slightly better than the 62-6\nin 1952-53.\nBy the time I.C. reached the Hostel after tn eir exertions on the field and celebrations in sundry\nbars they retired exhausted to bed, and Frank should\nhave had a good night's sleep.\nHEAD CF THE9(9 L re lo See Si I The Imperial College Boat\nClub will be supporting, to its fullest extent, the Tideway\nHtsdd of the River Race to be\nheld on Saturday March.24th,1956.

Unfortunately, at the\nmouth of Rat Cut the Clr.ft on crew still had a lead of ao an vas and the I.C.c re ir were requested by the umpire to\ngive way. The Clifton crew, no longer hard pressed, slackened\noff here and the I.C. crew were almost \"paddling light\". On\noo ming out of the out the I.

By this time however, No. 47, Christ's( Camb.) were\nout of sight and the 1st Till rowed alone to ths finish.\nThe seo on d VIII had trouble at the second (Fisheries)\nout where they were the outside crew of a bunch of four\nra of ng neck and na ok to the cut wh i oh was in a right hand\nben'\". Not only had they to give way as the group converged\n01 the cut but, being the overtaking crew, on coring out of\nthe cut were forced by rule to pass on the left which was\nthe outside of the bend.

March) havoc was\nagain let loose at I.C.; the R.C.S. held their Carnival, \"Night time with Neptune\". Students\nintent on dancing and Asbauchery were introduced\nto life in an underwater cavern, who where, the\nattractions were Mr. Vere Atkinson's mermaids,\n( their Green tails brought back memories of The\nGreen Lady, and we paused to reflect on who\nmodelled for Mr. Atkinson's creations, no con-clu sion, however, was reached.) The flats were\nof a standard which we have come to expect from\nthe R.C.S.. A rough estimate of the time that\nwent into their preparation is500 man/women\nhours. Had the unskilled labour been pai*3/6 par hour.the cost would have been \u00a387..10..0.\nMusic from the I.C. jazz band, the Clubmen\nand others was enjoyable, and a dull cabaret\nlivened up at the end with a custard pie act\nin which even the audience participated, law\nprimary feature of carnivals is the fancy dress.\nIt was noticeable that there was a distinct lack\nof Inspiration and originality in the dress of the\nmajority present.\nRECTOR'S ADVICE\nIMPLEMENTED\nI. C.1st. XV completed a great season by\nwinning the University\nCup Final last Saturday. This was I.C.'s fourth winning final in five years.\nThe fact that a horse called \"Brian\nOge\" won the first rac^ at Lingfield on Fri day was considered a happy augury for the\noccasion.

Several suggestions have\nmade to preserve the Colloutt building and tower,\nand although these will no doubt be considered, it ie\nen ll k ely that any great oh ange will be made In the\npresent plans.\nThe remarkable feature of the reo on s tru o tion is\nthe retention of the Royal College of Music and the\nhouses in Queens Gate by Imperial Institute Road. The\nformer is rumoured to be preserved by met u a loon sent of all o ono er ned be o a use of the Royal Patronage the\nCollege reo i eves. Sinoe this area was never considered\nfor the expansion, it should not effect the College\nmaterially, but the London College of Secretaries\nbuilding and Alexander Court region may influence\nImperial College Union considerably.\nThe Reotor has pointed out that the Zoology and\nBBtany departments will now have to remain in the\nBeit Building. One of these departments is to occupy\nspace originally intended as hostel ac como dati on this summer, so that instead of the Beit Hostel\nincreasing even more in size, it will not now be as\nlarge as originally intended. Nevertheless, the\navailability of $he temporary gymnasium and the\nSenior Common Room'this summer should enable about 30\nnew rooms to be added to the ac como dati on. This will\nbe the first stage towards the 1^00 extra residents\nmentioned by the Reotor in his Inaugaral Lecture,\nbet it appears the Union will have to wait a very\nlong time before the whole of the quadrangle is\ncleared of builders materials and is completely\nresidential.\nWhen will Imperial College have 1000 residential\nstudents? This figure was ^recommended* by the I.C. president four years ago- when there were only 1500\nstudents at the College\n1L1I1 HUM\nThe 8TU DENT of LEISURE BREAKFASTS\nMany bachelors inhabit single rooms and by a process of\ntrial and error have devised for themselves a routine far the\npainful daily process of waking, dressing and breakfasting.\nHaving bedded down at 3a.m. resolving to be up aj\u201ethe\nor a ok of dawn to do the work that had not been attempted on the\nprevious evening, the alarm goes unheeded at 6.30 am\u00bb In time\nthe sleeper develops as u boon sio us act ios of swiping the o look so that the button is driven firmly into the works before the\nalarm'has run far one second.\nTwo hours later oort BQ id us neas, slowly returns to the\nrep um bent form which then remains awake but unable to open\nhis eyes {or some time; whan he finally does the room is\nstill gyrating as drunkenly as when he kip ped down.\nThe next process is o on neo ted with preparing a frugal\nrepast for an un reo e pti ve stomach. Without exposing more torso\nthan absolutely necessary the gas fire is lit and the loaf of\nbread retrieved from the mouse hole whence the other inmates 1\nof the room have dragged it. A slice of dry bread Is propped\nagainst the fire to char. The next operation is to brew some\nlubricant for this Meal. Coffee, is employed universally\nbe o a use Its prep a eet tian requires fewer unit operations than tea.\nThe gas ring is invariably on the further side of the fire from\nthe bed. A cracked o up and a dirty spoon, which su ff ioe as .\ncrockery and cutlery are retrieved from under the bed.

The only I.C. student I have\nmet who is opposed to the demolition of the Imperial Institute is, oddly enough, John Cox. As we can safely assume\nthis is The Party Line, readers will be Interested to hear\nthat they have no plans for the building in their s a hens baSf\nmerely wish to preserve the torture facilities in the basement recently developed for Chemists who want to take Wednesday afternoon off.\nOURS IS WOT A RIO CARNIVAL. There was a strong smell of\nether along one of the hostel o or rid or s an the night of the\nCarnival.\nTHE SCIENTIFIC MIND. So R.A.F. Bomber Command are illustrating the Flying Safely Review with pin-ups to encourage\npilots to look at it more frequently. Should I.C. be afraid\nto stoop to this - why can't we have picture books of Windmill girls tattooed with differential equations. Alas, Ii doubt if this would reduce the fail rate but[ provide just\nanother arbitrary division for examination purposes - those\nwho can't tear themselves away from the book and those who\no an't tear themselves away from the Stage Door of the Windmill.\nR.C.S. MATHEMATICAL AND PHISICAL SOCIETY, tried Whitbread's for their brewery visit this year, As this company are\nrather more generous with samples than the usual Watney's and Guinness, the visit was the most successful for some\nyears.\nA WOMAN FOR THE CARNTVALi Our report on the Carnival contains\nan estimate of the number of man hours spent on preparations.\n| This makes me wonder how many man hours are expended on the\nacquisition and pre\u2014treatment of partners. We heard of one\nE.'C. S. Cassanova who started looking for a partner at the\nprevious Saturday's hop but his Sstaady\" (whom he didn't want\nto take) turned up so he had to put thing* off to the jiving\nclass on Monday where he was unfortunately turned down\ntwice. Thus frustrated, he accepted an offer to fix him with\na blind date; 3heo cul d n't go but said she had a friend\nwho wanted to, but as thi3 friend turned out to be one of\nthose who had turned him do-.m on Monday, he fled and decided\nto try an ax. The ax. wasn't having any and our poor friend\n^was no nearer and loosing considerable face, until he was\n\"ix ed on another blind a few hours before the Carnival\nstarted. The alternative is to have the thing arranged a few weeks before hand. This necessitates a lot of time\nspent politely keeping in to u oh and, for the o are ful man,\npre-treating her for the event. I suppose some will lecture\non the advantages of a steady girl friend, but is this a reasonable solution?\nUNO DONG MERRILY. Amongst those at the meeting to preserve\nthe Imperial Institute a week last Monday, was a small ~\n~\nhostel contingent who like to hear the sound of the bells\nin S. Kensington.\nTHE SCANDINAVIAN MYTH. As Sweden takes more English students\nfor vac. work than any other foreign country, there are\nquite a number in the College intimately o on neo ted or very\ninterested in certain aspects of Swedish life. They -,-ill be\ninterested to hear that a member of our staff recently\nreceived a newspaper cutting headed \"Engelska sexual morale n ty ok s sla alia i ek or d.\" PROGRESS. Many who attended the Rector's lecture an the new\noo lle ge were d is a ppi on ted in not hearing where a new Planning\nDepartment is to be housed.\nISOLATION D0CTSINE. Guilds having passed a motion deploring\nthe action of the Mines in discussing N.U.S. before the\nI.C. meeting, it is now only left to the R.C.S, at their\ncoming discussion of the nat ter, to pass a motion de pl orl nc Guild's attempt to interfere in the affairs of another coU eon \"Keen your hands to yourself.\n\n"
