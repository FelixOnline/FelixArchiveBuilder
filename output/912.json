    "content": "Feature Felix 912 1\n1 October 1\n9\n9\n1\nThe first Monday of term and after\nthe amazingly stressful registration\nprocess everybody was in need of\na nice relaxing evening. The New\nYear's Party was anything but.\nBob. That's a rather funny name\nfor a band. Yes. It's short for, err,\nBob. Bob are far and away the best\nAnd The Family Cat. I thought\nthat they were better than Bob. Sod\nit, you were there. You were there\nweren't you. No? Then you are one\nof the saddest, nay the saddest\npathetic person in this place.\nAfter that the e Volution club that\nhad been running upstairs since\nFive Days that\nYour chance to\nrelive happy\nmemories of\nFreshers' Week.\nSend a copy of\nFelix home to\nyour mother and\ngrandmother\nand her budgie.\nenthusiastic, awaiting acts of rib-tickling freshness.\nThe com per e had a nice line in\nunderstated lad dish humour. Sadly\nhe believed that the only common\nfactor in ' Yo of culture is an\nundying wish to talk about football.\nHe ran through a list of important\ntopics such as, The Police, more\nfootball, drugs and your Grandmas\nuse of the word 'pop', before\nintroducing us to the first act;\nIt was revealed that Sean Lock was performing for the first time at\nthe comedy night. All that I noticed\nwas that he seemed rather upset\nband to have played Imperial for,\nooo h, between five and ten minutes.\nIf, however, you are reading this\nreview because you can't remember\nsquat, it's tough shit. I'm not going\nto tell you what you missed, and it\nwill teach you not to drink to\nexcess.\nThe Family Cat were much the\nsame.\nWhat do you mean, you want to\nknow what I thought. What is this,\nPoints of View?. Very well then. I thought Bob\nsounded pretty much the same as\nevery other indie guitar band, not\nto say they're bad. Not to say they\nwere different either. They just are,\nlike John Major just is.\naround nine o 'clock was flooded by\nthose that could still walk. The music played and the people\nraved, and a generally good time\nwas had by all. At around half\ntwelve (or was it latter, I cant\nremember?) the sweet ing mass\nmoved downstairs, complete with a four feet tall 'e'.At around three\nin the morning the hundred or so\npeople left standing staggered\nhome. Wednesday was The Freshers\nComedy Night aptly named as only\nFreshers that bought the All-in-One\nFreshers week tickets ever go.\nConsequently the Concert Hall is\nwall to wall with the young and\nabout something, so much so that\nhe lost his temper a huge number\nof times. This ill control emotion\nlead to points were Mr Lock appeared unsure what he was\ntalking about. This could have been\nsaid to add a 'surreal element' to the\n'comic moment', but the better\nknown phenomena of 'embarrassing silence' was the\nresult. Nice try but he needs a bit\nmore experience.\nAfter a short break, the awesome,\nlong awaited Alan Parker stormed\nonstage. Alan Parker's act\nreminded me of the sort of people\nwho appear selling 'Socialist\nWorker' whenever you want to do\na quiet bit of shopping. With hand\n10-1\n1 October 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 912 Feature\ndrawn cards he instructed the\nassembled mass how to be 'right\non'. This is funny for 10 minutes\non Paramount City (where Parker\nhas appeared) but any longer and it\nbecomes tedious.\nCertainly, the com per e was the\nbest thing there (unless Alan Parker\ncan find a new joke). Everyone else\npresent enjoyed themselves, although the exchange of the rapier-sharp wit of trained minds was\ndefinitely absent, the best heckle I heard was 'fuck off. on the M40 but were slightly more\nentertaining than being the said\nhedgehog. Step Off.\nVoice of the Beehive, now there's a good live band. 'Monsters And Angels', T Say Nothing', classic\npop songs all of them. What a coup\nto get them to play here. I saw them\nthe other week at Cambridge, and\nthey were bloody good. I wonder\nhow they'll fare at ICU? Up the stairs then. Through the\ndoor, and what is it. Not B hives at\nall. Some kind of crap music, but\nseeing as I am the only person in\nthis building who actually saw them\nunfortunately none of which were\non sale here, they're signed to the\nsame record label as The Cure. So\nwhat are they like?\nBloody good, as you're asking.\nIf you missed this through queueing\nfor a burger or faff ing or being\ngenerally unconscious then you\nreally screwed up this time.\n'Fountain Of Youth',' Kingdom', about seven or eight other songs.\nAnd an encore. And about as close\nto stage invasion as I 've seen here.\nShame they're so ugly really. Still,\nwhat do looks matter, it's personality that counts.\nThe Family Cat\nComedy Night com per e The Giants of Jive Shook the World\nThank God it's Friday! The last day\nof what will probably the most\nenjoyable week at Imperial College.\nIn addition to the bands and disco\nthere were the t radi tonal casino and\nfilm shows. Outside burgers and the\nlethal cocktails were on offer, ready\nto remove your money and your\nbrain cells.\nThe Disciples had about as much\nlife as a small squashed hedgehog\nthat doesn't describe them as crap,\nI don't see why I should disagree\nwith such overwhelming public\nopinion, or something.\nCandyland All non fresher s please refer to last years review of\nCandyland. I still think they're\nfollowing me, you know, I mean,\nwhy else would they come to\nImperial. I mean, this band have\nplayed Wembley Arena, and have\ncooler T shirts than James or Neds,\nRay JellyBelly's Giants Of Jive\nwere, well, jive. I haven't found\nanyone who likes jive yet, but when\nI do, I 'll tell you what they thought.\nI thought that they were quite good,\nbut the music just ain't my style\nhoney.\nNext Week. Next Friday, IC ents\npresent Spitfire, supported by\nHerb, doors open 9pm, tickets \u00a33\n(\u00a32.50 adv. \u00a31.50 ents card). So\nthere\n\u2014 It \u2014\n\n"

The annual\nFreshers Tournament provided a showcase for new snooker talent at\nImperial. This years finalists had to\ncome through a field of28 starters\nand a marathon five and a half hours\nof snooker.\nThe first semi-final match was\nbetween Simon Bough (Chemistry)\nand Robert Trosino (Maths). Both\nplayers reached the semi-finals after\ncomfortable wins in the earlier\nrounds. In a best of three frame\nsemi-final, Robert beat Simon two\nframes to nil, in 2 close fought\ngames. The second semi-final was\nbetween Amin ur Rahman( Chemistry) and Mike Spence\n( Math s).Ami nur made two successful come backs to win on the\npink and black respectively, beating\nMike two frames to nil.\nAfter his defeat, Mike Spence\ncommented that Amin ur was \" a bloody good player'' and went on\nto predict that he would win the\ntournament. And so it was that\nAminur Rahman went on to win the\ntournament without dropping a frame, thus collecting the \u00a315 first\nprize. The loudest cheer of the\nafternoon went to the only female\ncompetitor, Helen James, after\ndefeating her first round opponent.\nBut she narrowly failed to reach the\nquarter finals, after a gallant effort\nin her second round match.\nSeveral competitors were heard\nto comment on the pleasant\natmosphere of the Snooker Club, located on the top floor of the Union\nbuilding, and how very reasonable\nthe \u00a35 membership was for the use\nof four full size tables for the whole\nyear.

All RCS Union organised was\nthe burger stall at this event.\nThe notes that were found on the\nstall were noticed after I had\nreturned a forgery to a customer\ntrying to buy some food. I checked\nthe till and found two others, and\nSports Centre\nInvestment\nDear Adam,\nProposals to change the Sports\nCentre and to develop the Southside\nfacilities represent an investment by\nthe College of the order of \u00a30.75m. VACANCY WARDEN SHIP CLAY PONDS The College invites applications for the\nnew position of warden at Clayponds\nwhich is available from 1st December1991. Clay ponds is an exciting new College residential development in Ealing, mainly\nfor 2nd and 3rd year undergrads and\npost grads. Wardens receive rent free accommodation in return for pastoral\nduties within their residence. The post is\nopen to all non-undergrad members of the\ncollege.\nIf you would like further info and an\napplication form contact Louise Ail ward, ext 8690/3276, Room516, Sherfield.\nClosing date for applications is 31\nOctober 1991\nThe plan is that this outlay should\nbe recouped by encouraging more\nuse by both college and non-college\npersonnel. Since, during the\nvacation and at weekends in term\ntime, the Sports Centre is very\nmuch under-used this would seem\nto be a sensible idea from which\neveryone should benefit.\nWhat we have to ensure is that\npreferential use is retained by\ncollege personnel and also that the\nchanges, whilst attracting outside\nusers, do not represent an\nunacceptable compromise for\ncollege users.\nThese proposals of change have\nto be approved by the Athletics\nCommittee which is responsible to\nthe Governing Body for college\nsports provision. I have asked Val Straw, the Facilities Manager to\nprovide a display of the architects\ndrawings in the Sports Centre so\nthat users can see what is planned\nand can inform their representative\non the Athletics Committee of their\nopinions.\nYours sincerely,\nKen Stevens.\nI wrote 'Forgery' across them, so\nthey could not be used again. Not,\nas your article implied, that the stall\nreceived these notes with forgery\nwritten across them.\nOn finding the notes, I told Andy\nFlanagan, the Union Bar Manager,\nand also the organiser of the IC\nRugby Cocktails.\nI hope this rectifies the\ninvolvement of the RCS Union and\nthe happenings on Monday night.\nYours sincerely,\nGareth Smith, RCSU Honorary\nSecretary 1988-90\nBrown\nNose\nDear Adam,\nI am writing to congratulate\neveryone involved in the events\norganised last week. They were all\nsmoothly run and very enjoyable.\nFriday's event however was slightly\nmarred for me by a very unfortunate incident.\nA member of the RCS Burger\ncrew showed a marked lack of\nintelligence and 'borrowed' two\nknives from the Mine's Cocktail\nstall. This resulted in a slight\naltercation. As the organiser of the\nBurgers, I would like to apologise\nto Mines and can assure you it will\nnot happen again. The missing knife\nhas been recovered and will be\nreturned, contact me somehow.\nOne of the guests had a marvellous idea, if he stole two\nbags of burger rolls he could get\ntwenty-four burgers free! I hope\nyou' re feeling very proud of yourself and would appreciate a \u00a324\ndonation to Rag to cover the cost.\nOnce again, sorry to Mines.\nDavid Ensell, RCS Ents Chair.\nYOU REBOUND, At STA TTsvel, we're all seasoned travellers so we should know a thing or two\nabout where you're headed.

But there is a sense in which we are\nlooking for men and women who are\npositive thinkers. In other words, yes-people, rather than bureaucrats.\nPeople who believe that anything\nis possible, and who can come up with\nnew ideas and solutions..\nWhere a yes-person sees challenges,\na bureaucrat only sees problems.\nA yes-person knows that a mistake\ncan often be turned into an advantage\nlater on. Others try only to avoid making mistakes in the first place, knowing that new ideas always carry risks and so the safest answer for them to give is\ngenerally no.\nOf course the world needs both\nsorts of people.\nBut our kind of yes-people are\nrare.

However, having interviewed\nAlison Shaw and found Her to be\nall things to this particular man, My objectivity is looking decidedly\npunch-drunk. Listening to Wings of\nJoy, it's easy to conclude that this\npoor, deluded w anker was always\ngoing to be devastated. Bloody well\nfloored, in fact.\nEskimos & Egypt\n-Don't You Do It\nWhen I got my rather grubby m its on this one I thought 'great, a dance\nrecord that means something, not all\nthis 'move you body, body', shit',\nwhat an amazing and regrettable\ndisappointment.\nTheir rip-off of G'n' R's Sweet\nChild of Mine showed these crass\nrockers in their true light, homophobic, macho bullshit ers that\nhave about as much talent as the\nflies on my dogs back. This will be\nlost amongst the myriad of Sharon\nand Tracy discos around the\ncountry. It may bring them chart\nsuccess but would you wont to be\nthe one to knock Brian Adams off\nnumber one? I thought not\nPebbles\nYes. I have dreaded the prospect of reviewing this. Lost sleep over it.\nDamn near cut off the end of my\nfinger because of it. The brute truth\nabout Wings of Joy is it's colossal,'\nyet at the same time, gentle and\nunderstated beauty. This is why I should hate them. I'm supposed to\narticulate suitably elegant prose,\nand it's supposed to be (reasonably)\ntangible. Making Cranes tangible is\nselling them short, and why should\nthey stoop to earthbound flesh when\nthey're busy etching a trail to\ninfinity?...!\nWatersong is fine, a deliriously-layered mesh of heat-damaged\nspray-paint textures enveloping,\nwith Alison holding both can and\nblow-torch. Starblood. Jesus. Give\nMe air, for fuck's sake. Starblood.\nCarter USM\n-After the\nWatershed\nI make no bones about this; I do not\nlike Carter. It is for this reason I formally apologise to Ginny of 'Bad\nMoon'. I am the last person who\nshould represent Felix at a press\nconference for Carter, but at the\ntime, there was no-one else. Sorry.\nOh, and while there were worse\nbands at Reading this year, it is not\nenough to be a minor improvement\non shit. So they reckon Andrew\nEldritch thinks they're the second\nbest band around? Yeah, sure.\nWayne Hussey believed Him, as\nwell.\nThe most elegant stiletto piercing\nand, with incalculable care and\nsensitivity, scraping up and down\nthe length of Alison's vertebrae;\nmine too. I'm dying here, slowly,\nhopelessly, deliciously, dying. My God. Me.I don't deserve to die like this. Where's My Hate Now I Need\nIt?.\nMy whole passage thro' these sonic\nnight-s capes is fraught with the chill\nof a primal anguish, and the harsh,\nangular shadows of a blind fury.\nChrist knows how I could be so\narrogant as to believe that I could\nadequately translate this for you.\nYeah. With such as Leaves of\nSummer, Tomorrow's Tears,\nHopes Are High, I discover My nemesis hidden behind My heart's desire. My nemesis is the Snow\nQueen. You remember Her, don't You? She summoned the ghost of\nbreathing and blew snowflakes on\nKay's heart. Well, such fragile,\nfiligree structures are currently\ncolliding with mine, and they're no\nlonger melting...\nWho gives a damn, I'm past\ncaring. Basically, if You' re still\nreading this, if you haven't thrown\nit down and gone out and bought\nthis fucking record, then you are\nfirst class tw at. This is not a random\ninsult. I have concluded this from\nthe obvious lack of value You place\non Life. If you have any\ndisagreement with this, come into'\nthe office and I will play Adoration\nto you. It's the last song. It is also\nextraordinary, sullen and gorgeous,\na slight legion of blurring, water-washed features and misshapen\ndefinitions. Oh, give Me Wings of\nJoy that I may bring it to all things.\nYes. My loathing Knows no\nbounds. The Album of the Year.\nDavid. Wretchedly enough, Carter have\nagain turned in quite a decent\nrecord. These people are becoming\nnagging ly difficult to deal with; if\nit was all Clash styli sms and\nridiculous punning (read 'John\nPlayer Special number 666') they\nwould be easily dispensed with.\nWhat buggers up my attempt to\nmake a whipping boy out of Carter\nis, in this case, a bare keyboard\nopening exuding pathos and sensitivity, a line like 'Goodbye,\nRuby Tuesday; come home, you\nsilly cow', and Jimbob's idiomatic\nangst howling the above over the\nfade. It's one of those peculiar,\nsocial tales, indicting, awkward and\njarring. Yeah, on the strength of\nthis, I might actually grow to like\nthem. Now, for fuck's sake, give\nme my Steely Dan tape back.\nYouth ori a. Pele\n-Raid The Palace\nI think this might be some kind of\nsubversive attack on our wonderful\nroyal family. If I slag this I can\nforget being Lady Lise, can'tI? Right then, this is a bloody terrible\nrecord. On the other hand, it might\nbe the first shot in a campaign to\nclose the Camden Palace due to\nobscene pigs. In that case, I'd like\nto point out that they do say 'make\nsome noise', which should be\nreserved for people as crass as MC Hammer, and there's a strange kind\nof Country and Western style\ng eeee tar in there as well. It reminds\nme of Bob Geldof's Vegetarians Of\nLove, The Housemartins, Hothouse\nFlowers, stuff like that. Quite good\nreally. Bang goes my knighthood.\nLise Yates\nG.N.E. I Want You\nWhat is Great Northern Electrics?\nIt's the railway line from Kings\nCross to Leeds, York and the North\nEast, and it goes through Knebworth. This is a perfectly good\nreason to give it a right s lagging. However someone (fresher) did\nfloat the suggestion that I should\npossibly listen to the record before\nreviewing it. How peculiar. Still,\ntry anything once, I suppose. It\nstarts with something that might\npossibly be a train sample. Stop the\nrecord, I want to get off. Somebody\nstop it. Never mind, it's gone now.\nI 'll listen to it all, if you're going\nto be like that. Sounds a bit indie,\na bit Paris Angels, and there's some\nkind of fruit on the front cover,\nwhich is always a good sign. (Does\nBryan Adams have fruit on his front\ncover? See what I mean?) So,\nperfectly bearable, not particularly\noffensive to the ears or eyes.\nLise Yates\n6 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "1\n1 October 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 912 Clubs & Societies\nHistorical Fact or Fiction\nIs there room at Imperial College\nfor such sentimental drivel as\nreligion? Here, at one of the world's finest institutions of scientific\ninquiry and technological development (superior in most\nrespects to Cambridge, as we all\nknow), is there a place, ought there\nbe a place, for such unscientific\nnonsense as Christianity?\nWell is there room in Imperial for\nJulius Caesar? (That depends - how\ndid he do in his A levels?) You cannot prove by any 'scientific\nmethod' that Julius Caesar actually\never existed. You cannot do an\nexperiment to demonstrate the\nvalidity of the theory that Julius\nCaesar was.Nor can you formulate\nan equation that will yield the\ninevitable result: 'Julius Caesar'.\nThe issue of Julius Caesar's existance is an historical one, and\nhistorical questions are not\nsusceptible to scientific methods.\nThe issue of the truth of Christianity is an historical one. It\nis an issue of whether there is a personal God who spoke and acted\ndecisively through a man, Jesus\nChrist, and speaks and acts through\nhim even now. The historical\nevidence that Jesus existed is far\nweightier, according to objective,\ncommonly accepted criteria, than\nthe evidence that Julius Caesar\nexisted. The contention that Jesus\nwas more than a great man is also\nwell supported by solid historical\narguments.\nBeyond the historical issue,\nhowever, is an existential one. That\nis the issue of what sense, if any,\nto make of this life and how to live\nit. Scientific research an a mathematical calculations will\nnever tell you whether there is such\na thing as i ove', or goodness, or\nmeaning in this activity we call\n'life'.\nYet, much of what we know from\nscience speaks of God, that there is\na Creator behind the intricate design\nof nature.We've all known the\n'teleological impulse' that entices us\nto say that plants 'want' to get at\nlight, or water 'tries' to stay\ntogether. The most rigorous scientific training doesn't obliterate\nthat nagging sense that 'all this\ncame from somewhere'.\nAnd even more, what we do not\nknow, indeed cannot know, from\nscience speaks for the existance of\nsomething beyond science. The longings of the human heart, our\nwell-nigh ir resist able desires and\naffections, that biochemistry can't satisfactorily explain, impel us\ntowards a higher knowledge than is\naccessible to simple laboratory\nwork. Easy enough to say it's all a matter of electrical impulses and\nchemical reactions - remind yourself of when your father dies,\nor your girlfriend says she loves\nyou, or a friend in the burn unit of a hospital or the birth of your first\nchild. The question will assert itself,\n'why do we have these reactions\nand impulses?' Is chemistry the last\nanswer?\nThe mere existance of such\nquestions doesn't vouch for\nChristianity, but Christianity offers\nreal answers. For all scientists who\nhappen to also be human beings,\nChristianity may merit a bit of research.\nIf you are interested in knowing\nmore, we are running a series of\npresentations and discussions on the\ncore facts of Christianity every\nTuesday at 12.30 pm in Ele c Eng403 B.Or you can contact me on\n0 7 1 - 5 8 4 - 2 9 3 3 or through my pigeon hole.\nBen Quant, ICU Christian\nOutreach, Biochem II.\nORIGINAL TALENT| An exceptional opportunity in merchant han king Innovative, creative, dynamic; Bankers Trust is among the most\nsophisticated merchant banking organisations in the world.\nOur approach stresses originality, both in the deals we do for our\nclients and in our people.\nEach year we seek out a group of talented individuals at graduate\nlevel for our offices in London and continental Europe.

Then despite a valiant attempt to escape, Penguin\nwas grabbed by the C CU Execs and\nwas thrown into the fountain.\nAfter lunch, the vans ferried most\npeople to the Macaulay Arms, Notting Hill Gate, to try to ' Drink a pub-dry'. By mid\u2014afternoon, the\nbar staff had realised that everyone\nwas there for the sole purpose of\nconsuming vast quantities of alcohol\nwith the ultimate aim of drinking\nthe place dry.\nThe following information is\ncourtesy of an independent expert:\n'Boddington's and London Pride\nwere off within half an hour, before\nmost of the collectors had arrived!\nA barrel of Flowers Original was\nput on by the staff and was off by\n7pm. That's288 pints in itself. The staff then put on an unsettled\nLondon Pride which noone touched as it wasn't fit to drink. No others came off tap, but all were\nseverely depleted and a couple of\nshorts were drained. All in all, I reckon it was a triumphant success!'\nAlthough the pub was not drunk\ndry, there was an excellent\natmosphere amongst the collectors\n(and a few others). The whole\nafternoon and evening was declared\na complete success. Fun and frolics on Oxford Street\nTiddlywinking down Oxford\nStreet is always well attended, but\nthis year the turn-out exceeded\neveryone's expectations.\nThe day began with everyone\nassembling at Southside where they\nwere led in a VERY loud call of\n'Wakey Wakey Southside' by this\nyear's RAG chairman, Penguin.\nUnion vans then ferried everyone\nto Speaker's Corner (Hyde Park)\nfor the start of the mammoth\nTiddlywink. After Kangelas and\nBoomalakas, the tid d ly winking began at about noon. Armed with\nRAG collecting cans and a few\ntiddlywinks, nearly 220 students\ntid d ly winked there way along\nOxford Street and Regent Street to\nEros, collecting money from the\ncrowds of shoppers as they went.\nTwo of the inviolate mascots \u2014\nJez and Bo \u2014 accompanied the\ntid d ly win kers on their travels. Most\npeople finished by about 2pm and\ndespite the fact that it started to rain,\neveryone joined in Ring-a Ring-aHi ya! It's Penguin, the RAG Chairman here. Well, last Saturday\nwas (almost) beyond belief. We raised an amazing \u00a32800, which\nwas double last year's total, and had\nlots of fun too.\nGreat effort was put in by all of\nthe C CU and Rag people, but\nultimately it was those who put their\nall into 'collecting, winking and\ndrinking' who really made it an\nevent to remember! So well done to\nall concerned!\nBefore I tell you about Live Monopoly( it's great, do it, you' ll have fun, we'll raise loads . . .\no oops! Sorry, sales pitch on\noverdrive) I'd better chuck in some\nthank-yous. Thanks must go to Dice\nand Games who generously donated\n2,000 tiddlywinks, without which\nthe whole day wouldn't have been\npossible. Thanks also to A to Z Geographers' Map CoLt d, who\nkindly donated 15 colour A to Zs,\nto give as prizes to the top 15\nfresher s. And thanks to all the\ndrivers and the CC Us for their help.\nRight well that's enough of me\nthanking people, now MONOPOLY( it's great, do it,\nyou'll have Fun, we'll raise loads\n. . . oops sorry again). Live Monopoly is always great fun and\nraises loads! It's a team game, so\nget your team of 4 to 6 together\nNOW if you haven't already.\nBasically we give each team a set\nof clues and each member of each\nteam gets a collecting can. The clues are your team's reason for\nmanic ally mobbing your way all\nover our beloved capital.\nWe' ve basically got a clue for every\nstreet on the Monopoly board. Each\nclue, for which you have to visit the\nstreet to be able to solve, is worth\na certain number of points. The team with the most points wins. The\nCC U's motorised mascots will be\ntravelling around to act as\nCommunity Chest and Chance\ncards, and a roaming jail van will\nalso be on the prowl to capture any\nteam it sees. You can also get points\nin other ways. These include\ncollecting lots of money (this is the\neasiest way), having a team mascot\nwhich must be carried at all times,\nturning up in fancy dress (the sillier\nthe better), and by acquiring\ntreasure.\n'Treasure' is always a dubious\ntitle, because most people tend to,\nwell let's not beat around the bush\non this one, 'nick' signs and cones.\nThis isn't difficult, let's face it,\nanyone can nick a cone! So we're\nlooking for 'clever' treasure. In the\npast, clever treasure has included a fast-food baseball cap, a fast food\nemployee's badge saying ' Grim Reaper, how may I help you?' and\nan arrest warrant all of these were\nobtained by haggle and banter, not\nspanner and bolt cutters. So there's a challenge for you!\nPRIZES. Yes, there are prizes,\ntoo! Firstly there's the prizes from\nMEN CAP( for whom we're collecting) for the highest personal\ntotals of the day. These are BIG. The final total collected was\n\u00a32,804.81, compared with \u00a31,400\ncollected at last year's tid d ly winking. The approximate\ntotals for the individual CC Us are:\nRCS \u00a31750\nC&G \u00a3870\nMines \u00a3120\nThe top fresher collector was\nTamsin Braisher who managed to\nget \u00a353.71 and the overall top\ncollector was Massie Harper who\ncollected \u00a377.43. Both totals are\nexcellent. Well done to everyone\nelse who collected - every penny\nhelps!\nAll of the money collected on\nSaturday is going to Action Aid,\nwho help people in the third world\nto help themselves.\nIf Tiddlywinking is anything to\ngo by, then this year's RAG( including the Live Monopoly tomorrow) should be BIG! Beccy Land\nThe catch is that there are lots of other RAGs coming to collect for\nthe day, so you' ll have to compete\nagainst them. There are also prizes\nfrom us here at I CRAG. Our usual\nincentive scheme also operates\n(collect \u00a350 for a mug, \u00a3150 for aT shirt and \u00a3300 for a sweatshirt),\nso if you've already collected some\nmoney at Tiddlywinks, you've got\na head start!\nLast year, Monopoly raised\n\u00a34,600, but with our astounding\nstart to this year, I reckon we could\neasily double that! All we need are\nLOTS of teams collecting LOTS of\nmoney and having LOTS of fun in\nthe process! So, dress up, be silly\nand we'll see you for registration in\nBE IT QUAD from 10am onwards\n(though we want everyone back by\n6pm, so the sooner you start, the\nmore time you have!\nSo, Be Mad, Be Silly & Be Part\nOf It!! Cheers,\nPENGUIN Rag Chair 91/92\nPS Beccy did this year's clues, so\nshe's the one to bribe (if you can\nfind out who she is).\nPP S Last Saturday we woke up\nSouthside at the crack of 11am. Look out Beit! Any suggestions for\naWake y Wake y Evelyn Gardens?\n\u201415\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion Felix 912 1\n1 October 1\n9\n9\n1\nThe world is so full of 'isms'\u2014\nracism, sexism, ageism. Do we\nreally need to take on board a new\none? I'd say yes because there is a prejudice which has affected me and\nwhich might affect you also. It is\nGraduateism.\nGraduateism\n'Being a graduate and a female and of\nIndian origin\nwas a very\ndisconcerting\nexperience.'\nYou' ll be spared the sordid\ndetails, but suffice it to say that\nmany companies ask for high\ncalibre graduates without really\nhaving any knowledge of their\npersonal needs, aspirations or\ncapabilities, and we\u2014delicate\nflowers\u2014can be made to work with\npeople who are actively resentful of\nwhat they see as silver-spoon\nupstarts.\nSo now let the muck-chucking\nbegin. I was offered a job by a large\nmerchant bank \u2014 which looked\ngood. I was one of only three\ngraduates to be taken on in their\ncomputing area\u2014which sounded\ngreat. I was paid mega bucks \u2014\nwhich felt brilliant. But then I was\ndumped into a technical back-water,\nshaken by fears of redundancy and\nsubjected to a working en v iron ent suffused with fag-smoke, innuendo,\nracism and ignorance. Most of my\ndata centre colleagues were thinly\ndisguised spi vs who expressed open\nhostility to the 'bloody graduates',\n'bloody foreigners' and of course\nthe monstrous regimen of women.\nHence me, being a graduate and a female and, incidentally, of Indian\norigin\u2014it was certainly a very\ndisconcerting experience to say the\nleast.\nJob satisfaction? In my first four\nmonths, I had to tab spaces and put\ncarriage returns into several very\nlarge documents. My productivity\nwas measured by how many\ncarriage returns/spell checks and\ntabs I made per day! (Nobody\nbelieves me, but it's true!). The rest\nof my stay at the bank (another one\nyear) was equally mind numbing.\nWhen I complained about the trivial\nnature of the work, I was told that\nI \"was trying to run before I could\nwalk. Can you imagine how\nfrustrated I felt after a first class\nhonours degree from Imperial and\nan MSc in computing? I felt as if\nI was washing my career life away\nwith no meaningful work experience that another company\nwould find useful (maybe that was\na deliberate corporate policy!).\nAnyway, in the end I got the\n'golden handshake' (in other words\nmy job no longer existed).\nI suspect it has something to do\nwith my not shutting up and putting\nup with racism (as my manager has\noften 'advised' me to do! Oh \u2014 how I wish I had taped some of those\nconversations!!).\nI can't complain too much since\nI came away with substantial\nredundancy payment. But it is not\nenough to quench the heat of\nresentment although starting a PhD at Imperial almost immediately\nafterwards has certainly softened\nthe blow.\nSo my advice to my fellow IC\nstudents is, even in these harsh\neconomic conditions, do look\nbefore you leap or you may cause\npermanent damage to your career.\nP.S. Since I left in March of this\nyear, several of the colleagues at\nCitibank who I did like and respect\nhave also left most by their own\naccord, with quite a few returning\nto university studies!\nUrmi Basu-Conlin, Materials\n1.

    "content": "Drugs\nNo Joke\nMarc Ellis, aka Penguin, Rag Chairman,\nenjoying a quick dip after tid d ly winking down\nOxford Street, See page 15 for further details.\nPaper Prize\nPolice were called to the Union Building last Tuesday after reports\nof an attempted sale of narcotics. A man in the Lounge Bar claimed that\nhe had been approached by a student who offered him ecstasy or\nspeed. He notified the Deputy\nPresident, Jonathan Griffiths, and\nCollege Security, who notified\npolice.\nThe suspect was searched by the\npolice in the Union Office and was\nfound to be clean. He later denied\nthat he had offered drugs and said\nthat 'it was a joke'. He told Felix\nthat the Police 'found nothing - I wasn't perturbed about it in the\nslightest'. The student who believed\nhe was being offered drugs\ncomplained that he was being\nharassed by the alleged drug seller\nfor the rest of the evening.\nZoe Hellinger, Union President,\nand Jonathan Griffiths, Deputy\nPresident have said that if any\nfurther drug incident is reported the\npolice will be called immediately.\nAdditionally, if any student is\napproached by a drug pusher, they\nshould not be afraid to contact those\nin charge. Terry Briley, IC security\nofficer, told Felix that the sale of\ndrugs 'will not be tolerated'.\nThree IC students from the Mineral\nResources Engineering department\nreceived prizes from the 1991\nSociety of Petroleum Engineers\nStudent Paper Contest in Aberdeen\nthis September.\nXu Dong Jing was the winner of\nthe PhD class whilst Jonathan Copp\nwas the winner of the undergraduate\nor MSc class. Anders Witterman\nwas the third prize winner in the\nsame class.\nTwenty nine papers were submitted to the contest. Eight\npapers came from Imperial College.\nThe, first prize winners each\nreceived cheques for \u00a3400 and were\ninvited to present their papers at the\n1992 conference. Mr Witterman\nreceived a cheque for \u00a3100.\nMr Jing is still at the college\nfinishing his degree. Messrs Copp and Witter man received their\ndegrees in September.\nBar Brawl\nViolence broke out last Saturday\nnight, 5 October, in front of the\nSouthside bar.\nHelen Roberts told Felix that as\nshe and three friends came out of\nthe bar they were confronted by\napproximately ten men. ' They just\ncarried on being very abusive\ntowards us,' said Ms Roberts. She\nadded that her friends wanted no\nI trouble and wished to leave.\nThis turned into violence in\nwhich one of her friends suffered\ninjuries to the face and stomach and\nCrime\nRoundup\nA resuscitator and phials of amyl\nnitrate were stolen from the college\nambulance this week, worth about\n\u00a3900.

    "content": "Reviews Felix 912 1\n1 October 1\n9\n9\n1\nWaiting for Godot\nSamuel Beckett wrote Waiting For\nGodot in 1955, which makes it all\nthe more remarkable that it sounds\nextraordinarily as though it were\nwritten with Rik Mayall and Adrian\nEdmonson in mind. Which is just\nas well, since it is none other than\nthey who tread the boards to bring\nus this adaptation (designed by\nDerek Jarman, although it could\nequally well have been Derek\nGriffiths).\nThe story tells of two gentlemen\nof fortune ( OK, tramps) who are\nwaiting for Godot. That's about it\nreally. While they wait they discuss\nlife etc. and complain of the clap,\nnot to mention meeting the odd rum\ncove. Well, exactly two actually.\nHowever, Sam (as we know Him)\nmanages to simultaneously weave\nthis into what the program notes\nclaim is an Allegory of the Theatre\nOf The Absurd. Which it may well\nbe, but what this translates to is that\nvery little happens over a great deal\nof time. Vladimir and Estragon are\ngenerally unhappy with their lot,\nalthough Estragon is pretty much\nincapable of remembering any of it\nand Vladimir is too busy pontificating on the finer points of\nphilosophy to notice. During their\nvigil, they repeatedly fail to make\nsense of their experiences in an\nendless loop which becomes steadily more tiresome, especially\nGerbil/Tetsuo at the\nScience Museum\nMichael Faraday! Charles Babbage!\nRAL the Robot! What is there to\nsay?\nWell, probably a little bit more\nthan that would be useful. At the\nmoment the Science Museum( free\nto IC, kids !) boasts a veritable\nfeast, nay, glut of exhibitions to\nregale your senses.\nTying in with the Festival of\nJapan, we start with a Robotics in\nJapan ex hi b which features loads\n(count them, loads) of our mechanical Mecchano pals in a variety of exciting ' n' fresh roles.\nMost of the twi ddl y devils are\ndisplaying their skills at useful tasks\nlike balancing spinning tops on eggs\nor building small steel boxes with\nflag designs on them. Either that or\nclimbing walls very badly (ie. with\nall the alacrity of a stoned squirrel)\nand pretending to be on Mars. Lots\nof them do nice arty things,\nincluding RAL himself, an\nindustrial welding robot who counts\ndancing (yeah !) and sumi painting\namongst his hobbies. Jolly nice\npaintings he does too; I shall\ntreasure my black-and- white\nbamboo for some time to come.\nMeanwhile, downstairs there's a special bit referring to the work of\nCharles Babbage, Esq., the\ngentleman responsible for the\nwonderfully baroque Difference\nEngine. Said Engine was an\nabortive attempt to build a mechanical Victorian computer,\nwhich never succeeded in its day.\nThis failure was put down at the\ntime to the happy go lucky m technology of the times, but now\n100 ! years later the Museum has\nbuilt a working version to\nBabbage's own specs, all glistening\nbrass and click e ty clock e ty ratchet y things. Hooray !\nAnd upstairs again, a gallery\ndevoted to the life and works of\nMichael Faraday and if I have to tell\nyou who he is you should be\nashamed of yourself. Lots of weird\nand wonderful electrical paraphernalia and the man himself\n(despite his great old age) lectures\nevery day.\nAll good rip roar in' educational\nfun and free too. Don't forget that\nif nothing else you can fight off the\nkiddies in Launch Pad and play with\nthe gizmos.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nEvery day hundreds of students\nwalk past a major tourist attraction\nwithout a second glance. The Science Museum, repository of\ngenius, is currently FREE to\nstudents at Imperial, so there's no\nexcuse not to see the exhibition of\ncurrent and futuristic Japanese\nTechnology, open until October\n31st. After an appalling (but short)\nvideo, a small display contains the\nprecursors to Japanese robots.\nThese ancient toys use sand and\nbalances to move, delivering tea or\ntumbling down steps. Through a doorway, however, one hits the\nforefront of technology with a walking robot that moves like a gracefully slow animal and a window cleaner that will climb\ngiven that said experiences are so\nfew, consisting mainly of getting\nbeaten up and mixing with a strange\nclass of people. There is a lot of\nvisual humour and a few great gags,\nbut the air of melancholy prevails\n(thanks to the script rather than Rik and Ade's portrayal). The story\nturns to metaphor and leaves the\naudience something to think about.\nThe thinking time easily elapses in\nthe time it takes to get outside.\nThe play may introduce a new\ngeneration to Beckett or simply\ndisappoint both purists of literature\nand bottom jokes. I liked it, and we\nsaw Harry Enfield in the audience.\nThe Grazing Plywood Persil\nBaked Bean\nvertical walls.\nDon't walk past the video\nscreens, they demonstrate some of\nthe most impressive robotics of the\nshow. My favourites are the pipe\nwelder and the pipe cleaner. The first welds a section of pipe from\nthe inside whereas the second\ninches its way along a thin tube,\nturning and dragging its multiple\nsections round corners and up\nstraights. With headlights resembling the head of a tapeworm,\nit could be straight from a sci-fi\nhorror movie!\nThe second half of the exhibition\nis interesting, but a little run of the\nmill. It contains industrial robots\nperforming more aesthetically\npleasing tasks, such as portrait\npainting and flower arranging. The introduction, however, is worth a mention, being the most\ncringe worthy part of the display. It\ncontains an Americanised Alice Through the Looking Glass strolling though current technology\nin simulated 3 D. Worth a look if\nyou can stand it.\nIt's an interesting exhibition, with\ndemonstrations of all the machines\nscheduled throughout the day. You must not miss the first working\nmodel of Babbage's difference\nengine either, situated behind the\nshop. Everybody at IC should take\nadvantage of the free entrance,\nespecially you lady engineers, since\none of the staff was complaining of\nthe predominance of males. Sounds\nfamiliar doesn't it.\nTetsuo\n\n"

True, free speech is a basic\ndemocratic right but nobody should\nbe given a platform to stir up racial\nhatred.\nMany members of the Jewish\nSociety lost grandparents and other\nfamily members in the gas\nchambers of Auschwitz and\nMajdanek.\nIt is important for all decent\npeople to prevent history from\nbeing re-written lest what has\nhappened once be allowed to\nhappen again.\nIf there are any Imperial academics out there publishing such\nrevolting fiction, please reveal\nyourselves so we can re-educate\nyou, or at least call on all students\nto boycott your lectures.\nYours,\nMichael Factor, Acting\nChairman Jewish Society.\nDear Editor,\nI read with interest the letter by\nJohn McMahon Moore in last\nweek's Felix 910 on the subject of\nthe sports centre. As captain of the\nImperial College squash club I speak for the rest of the committee\nand the club in endorsing every\npoint of Mr McMahon Moore's letter. I enclose a letter sent to every\nmember of the South Kensington\nSports Committee by the Squash\nClub committee on 13 September\n1991 voicing our concerns:\nAs concerned students of Imperial\nCollege we should like to bring to\nyour attention several points arising\nfrom the recent, and the proposed\nchanges to the Sports Centre.\nAlthough we are all members of the\nSquash Club Committee, and have\na vested interest in the squash\ncourts, we believe our concerns to\nbe relevant to all student users of\nthe Sports Centre. We would\nwelcome your consideration and\ncomments on the following:\n1. Are all die recent and the planned\nchanges in the best interest of\nImperial College students and staff,\nfor whom, after all, the Sports\nCentre was originally intended? It\nseems increasingly that non-college\nmembers are being welcomed and\nalthough their season\nticket/membership costs are\nsomewhat greater, they do not\nappear to reflect the sort of expense\nthat would be involved for these\npeople to join a private health club\nwhich would be their alternative.\nWe have no objections to private\nmembers (except that they crowd\nfacilities intended for students) but\nbelieve their payments should be\nemployed to sub sid is e student use;\nin this way we feel that the recent\n50% increase for a student season\nticket (now for only nine months,\nas opposed to twelve!) could surely\nhave been avoided. It also seems\nthat private members pay little,\nparticularly compared to staff, for\nexample anyone off the street (or\nfrom a local mansion) pays only lOp\nmore for a game of squash than\nsomeone who works at Imperial\nCollege. We are very concerned\nthat the running of the sports centre\nis being moved towards a private\nventure, rather than a college\nfacility.\n2. Although our sports centre is not\nluxurious, students are more\ninterested in clean, functional\nfacilities, than saunas and\nsolariums, even though these may\nattract more private members. We\ndo not believe that our students\nwould ever use a cafe/bar when\npopular sub sidi sed facilities are\navailable across the gardens.\n3. Charging for courts that are\nspecifically set aside for Squash\nClub members' use seems like a move aimed directly at eliminating\nany need or desire for the student\nto join the Squash Club. We\nstrongly argue against the\nintroduction of charges (\u00a31 for half\nan hour has been proposed). For a club member to play just once a week will now cost approx. \u00a340\nover the year (compared to only \u00a35\nSquash Club membership last year).\nWe also fear that the membership\nof the largest ACC club will\ndiminish and the club performance,\nwhich has been excellent in both\nUniversity League and UAU events\n(last year the ladies won the London\nLeague and won through to the\nquarter finals of the UAU), will\nsuffer. The college's sporting\nreputation will also suffer as a consequence.\n4. Last year's squash club captain\nspecifically requested to be included\nin SKSC meetings but was never\ninformed as to when they took\nplace. Now, more than ever, more\nstudent voice on this committee\nseems an increasingly important\nnecessity. Can this be guaranteed in\nthe future?\nWe would greatly appreciate a response on these matter. Thank\nyou for your consideration.\nYours,\nSquash Club Committee.\nWe have had two replies so far, one\nin support of our case and one from\nP.E. Mee claiming 'it had nothing\nto do with him' even though he sits\non the South Ken Sports\nCommittee!\nWe feel that it is time for the\npeople of IC to make a stand to save\nour sports centre from what looks\nlike impending privatisation. There\nis enough incentive to stop sport at\nIC with heavy workloads without\nadding a financial burden to it as\nwell.\nYours faithfully,\nC Robinson (for Squash\nCommittee).\nHow to cope with\nyour supervisor...\nSeminar given by\nEric Ash\nplus others\nfor PG s who want to\nsucceed!\nMech Eng 220\nFri 18th October\n5.30pm FREE\n\u201419\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "1\n1 October 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 912 Music\nAbsolution - Various\n'Tis indeed appropriate that my\ncurrent world view is as black as the\njourney to the heart of the\nMurphy' s. Once past the\nsuspiciously ' g off sleeve, it\nbecomes apparent that this is, in\nfact, 'g off', though any such\ncompilation that does not feature\nPil's Rise, Joy Division's Atmosphere or Sisters of Mercy's Body Electric suffers somewhat\nfrom tunnel vision.\nSo, with blinkers removed, I remove the sleeve. The Cure's Never Enough opens; it is amusing\nto witness how seriously young Bob\nOdd. We seem to be getting an\nawful lot of stuff resembling demo\ntapes these days. Champions of\nlittle-known music that We are, it's still odd. This is not a gripe. I mean,\nsome are good, some are downright\nbloody awful. Only one, this one,\nis fucking astonishing.\nMecca have the most lithe, frantic\nrhythm section since... I'm reminded of early Gun Club (I just\ndidn't want to say it). It's in that\nvein of deranged, bastardized\ngroove on which are layered a hideously edgy guitar and blazing\nis taken by his fans, though I 've\nalways found his shoe-staring\nhumility and effete vulnerability\ntrite and laborious. Never Enough\nis great fun though, the most fun\nthey've been since Love Cats way\nback in '84. Oh, the lost days of\nyouth... The ineffably silly Mission\nfollow this with Deliverance; bags\nof swagger and a lyric Robert Plant\nwould've killed for, this is just\nabout the best they'll ever give us.\nDie laughing.\nKilling Joke's( Oh God, NO!) glorious Love like Blood. Ok, so\nthis was as commercial as sex back\nin '85, the last days, but it still\nremains a finely- crafted testament\nto spook-pop. The Wonderstuff. A barrel of laughs. They always\nremind me of undercover policemen secreting themselves into\na drugs ring. Don't let me down\ngently' was always so\nWORKMANLIKE. It's face-off is\npower-of-madness vocals. Nick Galen, one-time member of the\nShrubs, literally croons his\npsychotic howls in such a way that\nOne is forced to consider genius a constituent of dementia, and not the\nother way round. His delivery of\nthe line \" My bad dreams have all\ndisappeared. I sleep easy for the\nfirst time in years now that you're\nbeside me\" is nothing short of\nnasty, and must surely inaugurate\nhim as the King of Melancholia and\nthe most unmitigated Fuck-up in\nrecording history. God knows why\nthere still only making demos.\none of the greatest pop songs of the\neighties, Echo and the Bunnymen's The Cutter-a steaming tune from a band who never dropped their ' H's or their ' T's and were still one of the coolest ever. This is followed\nby Siouxsie's frantic Hitchcock\npastiche, Spellbound. Great stuff.\nShortly after, our attention is\ndragged by the stupidly OTT Ziggy\nStardust, to consider Bauhaus. This\nhomage to His Davidness is one of\nfew really entertaining pieces\nproduced by Murphy, Ash and Co., or as I prefer, 'Duran Duran from\nHell'. I'm glad they're not around\nanymore - their outdated, pompous\nhistrionics and embarrassingly\n'arty' posturing are as dead as,\nwell, Bela Lugosi. After this the\nMary Chain's brilliant Some Candy\nTalking is, oddly enough, like a breath of fresh air.\nAnd onto A. A. E.. Or rather, not.\nA better Stranglers song wouldn't go amiss either, but Depeche Mode\nhave never been as good as on\nEnjoy the Silence. As for the rest,\nthe Neffs are great fun, as are the\nCreatures, the Damned and\nN.M. A., but I'm getting tired of\nwriting this. Sadly, the appearance\nof the Psychedelic Furs does\nnothing to dispel the (con)fusion of\nfeverish, incisive pop, and bloated\nstadium rock. Alice's House or\nPresident Gas would've been better.\nSome of these were/still are great\nbands, but this representation of\npost-punk rock music seems too\noften to contradict it's own principles. Any self-respecting goth\n(I know that verges on the self-contradictory) will already own\nmost of these, so who is this aimed\nat? the new kids on the pop scene?\nliberated metal heads? free-to-rock\nyuppies? Tell you what; You Decide, 'cos I dread to think.\nPost Scrip tum,My little\nAmerican Rose, now do You believe Me? David.\nOf the songs themselves, only Big\nHopes falls short of the mark, but\nthat's only because it follows the\nextraordinary Civil Kong Smasherit would make Love Will Tear Us\nApart sound as twee as Any Dream\nWill Do by comparison. WTjife\nSnow is a staggering, loosely-hinged build-up to a tumultuous\nbastard child of the Birthday Party\n- a wash of discordant keyboard\ndoes nothing to dispel my unease.\nYes, it is cruel to be kind to Your nightmares. More pain, please.\nSuperbus Augustus\nDalek Case.\nDinosaur JR\n-Town and\nCountry Club.\nKentish Town,\nI'd love to rave about the whole gig\nas perhaps anyone would who sees\none of their favourite bands. The\nbands were excellent, the sound was\nexcellent, and the draw was\nexcellent. I do, however, feel\nobliged to slag off the vast numbers\nof stage divers. What used to be an\nart form indulged in by the few and\nbrave with a finesse that was\nastounding has now become de\nrig eur it seems no gig experience\nis complete without stumbling onto\nthe stage and falling off again. No more a buzz but merely a ritual; it's just not good enough...\nTo be honest, I can't even\nremember the first band's name, let\nalone what they sounded like, but\nthe listed support band\u2014The Boo\nRadieys\u2014were good. Their version\nof the now somewhat clich e'd fuzzy indie guitar dance music (so\nexcellently played by My Bloody\nValentine and, more obviously;\nRide) was good, though somewhat\nmonotonous. They were lost in an\naudience who failed to offer any\nmore support than a few head-tossing mop tops. Maybe they were\nshot in the back by Impending\nGreatness?...\nNow. Now is the time to start\nspouting a load of wank about how\nfucking excellent Dinosaur were,\nand it would probably be the truth,\nbut finally the point of the evening\nbecame apparent. Despite J's legendary apathy, Dinosaur Jr. have\nproduced four of the most original\nalbums I 've ever heard, and they\nplayed all the noise ones tonight.\nFrom You 're Living All Over Me\nto Green Mind, it was all there, and\nwe lapped it up like a dog at it's own vomit. J Mascis dives around\nthe stage like some headless chicken\non acid that believes the only route\nto sexual gratification is via a guitar.\nEverything about the spectacle was\nover the top. Embellished with that\nextra guitar freak out, almost to the\npoint of glam rock (but not quite),\nperhaps the only complaint is that\nthe tunes are as catchy as shit on a shoe; they rattle around in your\nhead forever and any amount of\nrolling around on the grass won't get rid of 'em. But, after all, that's the point.\nZanie\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
