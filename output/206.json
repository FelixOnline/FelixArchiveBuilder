    "content": "10 FELIX FRESHERS SPORT\n1 GUIDE\nSCRUMPY\nTAKES\nITS TOLL!\nThis year l.C. Cricket Club\nTour Devon\nwith varied successes\nOn the Tuesday after the end of term, sixteen I.C. cricketers\nset off for Devon in the old rattletrap Larry calls a coach, but which\nshould be in the Brighton run. After many Bridge hands the company arrived in Southampton and played the University despite the\nonly rain of the tour. I.C. declared at 139 for 5, thanks to good\nbatting by Eastell, Hunt, and Cleare, but the opposition scraped\nhome by two wickets with a six from the first ball of the last over,\nRice taking 5 for 40.\nAfter a night in Dorchester where the \" Sydney Arms \" enforced\nprohibition due to the alleged escapades of the previous party, we\narrived in Yelverton and tied with the Bohemians at 141 each. This\nwas celebrated in the Rock Hotel and the coach where three Guildsmen and one minor were assaulted by twelve R.C.S. types. After\na stout defence and much bloodshed, order was restored and the mob\nstaggered into the Kynance, Plymouth, to dispute the few single beds\navailable. The unlucky losers had to share doubles with their\nfellows.\nNext day H.M.S. Drake scored 200 despite a marathon bowling\nspell by Roger Marriott, who took 5 for 56 in 28 successive overs.\nI.C. could not fathom the swing and cut of Devon bowler Pellew\nand only managed 64. More beer was drunk and the lads then had\na free preview of the Devonport Royal Tournament Field Gun team\npractising.\nAt Plymouth College on Friday, the staff raised 203 for 5\ndeclared while the I.C. fielders had to contend with a shower of\njavelins from youthful athletes and excellent batting by their masters.\nThis time the off-spin of Swinburne (Devon and Yorkshire 2nds) was our downfall and we could only equal the previous day's tally.\nSorrows were drowned at the local with our old friend Ted Mercer.\nOn Saturday we braved the by 8 wickets at Ashburton, where\nwe\nExeter 'by-pass, re acne d Exeter\nand defeated Brighton Brunswick\nscoring 160 for 6 in reply to their\n156 for 7 declared. Clements took\n6 for 48 and Eastell, Cleare and\nBlythin batted well. We celebrated this success in Torquay.\nSunday saw us playing out time\nagainst the Whiteways Cider XI. We got 105 for 9 in reply to their\n160. Eastell hit their famous tree\nwith the first shot of another good\nknock. Subsequently we changed\nour brew and indulged in a rather\nrowdy fielding practice.\nOn Monday everyone went\nbathing at Torquay before an\nevening game at Brixham where\nwe scored 166 for 3 in reply to\nth locals 174 for 5 declared all in\nthe space of 3 hours. (Sunde 41\nand 63 not out and Hunt 51).\nThen followed a hectic drinking\nsession during which ten R.C.S. men could not remember the\nKangela and were out shouted by\nthree Guildsmen led by one miner.\nSt. Andrews University beat us\nwe could only reach 104 on a green pitch. In the subsequent\nBeer Match Clements lost the ball\nwith a six which went through the\nopen roof of the coach into the\ndriver's pocket.\nWe beat the Lympstone Royal\nMarines on Wednesday Scoring\n141 for 7 declared and put ing them out for 63, thanks to the\nbatting of Eastell and Poyser and\nthe bowling of Marriott and Rice.\nThen celebrations and ten-pin\nbowling in Torquay.\nThe final match against\nPaignton was a disaster. The\nlocal pro', Handley, bowled us\nout for 48, which they got for\nthree wickets. We could not do\nmuch better in the beer game\nwhich followed.\nOur final record was: P10,W.2, T1,D2,L5; but a good\ntime and fine weather were enjoyed By all. Lack of an accurate\nand penetrative fast bowler and\ninconsistent batting were our main\nhandicaps.\nRUGGER\nRUGBY FOOTBALL CLUB\nThe I.C. R.F.C. is probably the\nbiggest college rugby club in the\ncountry. Every Saturday we turn\nout 8 and sometimes 9 XV's. The\n1st XV plays the second teams of\nmost of the big clubs such as\nWasps, Richmond, Rosslyn Park,\netc., and the standard gradually\nfalls to the B. V.'s who will play\nanyone who has a bar.\nTrials are being held at Harlington on Wednesday and Saturday next and free coaches are provided from the Union and it is\nhoped to see as many Freshers\nalong as possible.\nThe club trains on Monday\nevenings in the gym 5.30-7.30 and\nThursday 12.45 p.m. in the park.\nThere is also training on Tuesdays\nfor the 1st team and other keen\nmembers of the club.\nThe University Knockout Cup\nhas been won by Imperial College\n9 times in the last 13 years and it\nis only in the last couple of years\nthat our domination of the competition has ceased. However,\nwith the present nucleus of\nplayers and the full support of\nthe fresher s,I am confident that\nthe trophy will once again be in\nI.C.'s hands next March.\nHoping for full co-operation\nfrom every member of the club.\nM. TURNER,\nCaptain.\nI hope you find time to visit our\nstall on Freshers Day. We offer\nexcellent facilities to accomplished or novice players. If you\nwould like to play this i season come and see us now. The first\ntrial matches will be at Harlington\n(free coaches from the Union) on\nWednesday.\nOn Saturdays the club runs 4\nXI's against other well known\nLondon clubs, but on Wednesday\nwe only run one team and each of\nthe constituent college runs its\nown team. These four teams play\nin the U.L. Cup, and on remaining Wednesdays the constituent\ncollege teams play in the Stephenson cup. This is competed for\non a league basis. The club enters\nthe U.L. challenge cup, and sends\ntwo sides to the U.L. six a side,\nbeing the present holders of the\nlatter.\nThere is also a mixed XI which\nmaintained an unbeaten record\nwell into the second term. No one\nknows quite how this was\nachieved\u2014but it was! If you\nwould like to join do come along\nand have a chat with us, you will\nbe most welcome.\n\n"

    "content": "6 FELIX EDITORIAL TECH. OR VARSITY\nImperial College forms part of London University, but in fact is\nlittle more than a Technical Institution. Imperial has built up over\nthe years a name known throughout the world for producing Scientists (and Engineers) who are more than adequate. To-day a degree\nobtained at I.C. is still highly regarded for its technical merit; it is\nnot, however, thought by many to be a University Degree in the true\nsense of the word.\nAt the end of our time at I.C. we may gain our B. Sc. Degree,\nwhich is of course the object of the exercise, but the fact must be\nfaced, we experience little or nothing of a complete University Life.\nWe meet few students from other Colleges, in fact some of us take\npride over our insularity. We take no part in general student affairs\nwhich are arranged by N.U.S. and thereby deprive ourselves from\nbecoming better known through press reports of their activities. There\nis still a group of people in I.C. who think it big to be the odd one\nout. How can we be \" big \" when so few of the general public have\never heard of us. We rarely meet our lecturers outside of the Lecture Theatre or Tutorial Room. We have few if any discussions with\ntutors, for many of us have no personal tutor. Many of us take no\npart in any college activities, whether under the auspices of the\nUnion, or to a lesser degree the Halls of Residence.\nThe answer to all these criticisms lies with us, the students, for\nit is us who make Imperial College what it is. Most members of\nstaff are only too eager to discuss problems with us, but it is for us\nto approach them, not just sit back and complain about our relationship with them. The Union is for everyone to use, we pay for the\nprivilege, so take full advantage of it; there are Clubs and Societies\nwhich cater for all tastes.\nN.U.S., with its many advantages, may well be discussed again\nthis year. This is a serious matter, there are points of value for both\nsides of the \" in\u2014out\" question, let us discuss it sanely without any\nof the neurotic personal hatred that arose two years ago.\nN.J. WALKER. ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll l ill ll ll ll lUI IIII H WELCOME\nGIRLS\nsays\nANGELA\n\u00ab TAYLOR\nAn association in Imperial College, run solely by and for women\nstudents is surely a phenomenon in itself. I. C.W. A. despite its\ninevitable restriction in membership, plays an active and noticeable\npart in College and Union affairs.\nThe Women's Association organises social and recreational activities for its members. Many of these activities, especially the dances\nand parties, are very successful college functions. Visits to the\ntheatre and fashion houses, are also regular features of the associa-tion's activities. The Sports Club (I.C. W.S.C.) endeavours to cater\nfor the various sporting interests of the women students. Last year,\nseveral teams had notable successes in inter-collegiate matches. All women students, will find there is an opportunity to take part in\ntheir favourite sports, irrespective of their standard.\nThe Women's Association have their own lounge in the Union\nbuilding, in which to hold parties and meetings, or just relax with\na cup of coffee.\nWith the aid of this edition of \" Felix,\" a special welcome is\ngiven to all the new members of I. C.W. A. As in previous years, it is\nhoped that I. C.W. A. will have another enjoyable and successful year.\nANGELA TAYLOR, President I. C.W. A. THIS IS l.C. Over the last ten years Imperial College has developed at an\nunprecedented rate. All its facets, academic departments, hostels,\nand the Students Union received a bonus in the form of new buildings and facilities, but all these are mere frameworks for the people\nwho use them, for without these people\u2014you\u2014the College does not\nexist.\nOne of the most important parts of a University edu u cation is\nthe exchange and development of views with fellow students, and a climate to achieve this is possibly the difference between our form of\neducation and any other. If you never do anything then you can\nnever expect to have this contact; and therefore active participation in some part of College life is an absolute necessity.\nIn departments, where one works, student meets student and\nviews are exchanged. In halls, which unfortunately not everyone\nis lucky enough to inhabit, one will meet people with whom one's only apparent connections are eating, sleeping and living next door,\nbut much can be gained from such unlikely friendships.\nIn the Union Clubs one encounters students with whom one has\ncommon interests. If an active part is taken in the club then these\nare the people with whom one will mix most, be it travelling to a game, over tea before a meeting, or sharing a room on tour.\nThese personal contacts which you will develop are the very\nsubstance of University life, and unless advantage is taken of them\nyour education will be incomplete.\nAs in every sphere of life participation brings its own reward\nand I.C. Union is no exception. The facilities are available, as you\nwill see on the afternoon of October 5th when all the club will be\non display, but the onus is on the individual to make the best use\nof them. If you feel that something else is needed, make your opinion\nknown and then do something about it\u2014this is your Union. You\nwill have met most of the Union Officers by this time, remember that\nthey are your officers and approachable as such.\nCombine a successful academic career ; a well rounded personality derived from a breadth of interests ; and an ability to deal\nwith people and affairs, derived from an active Union life, and you\nwill have received a true University education.\nYour President,\nNORMAN E. PRICE.\nKNOW YOUR PRESIDENT Norman Price is the first English President of I.C. Union for\nthree years. Hailing from Halesowen in Worcestershire this ever\nsmiling, talkative lad is a solid\nproduct of the local Grammar\nschool. In those days of effervescent innocence he quickly cottoned on to the idea of not being a dull Norm(!) and represented his\nschool in fencing, cricket, rugby,\nlawn-tennis and athletics; and his\nbeing Deputy-Head Boy did not,\nhe claims, have any connection\nwith his position as Chairman of\nDebates and prominence in school\nplays and the choir.\nLuckily, Cambridge spurned\nhim and so in 1961 he entered\nI.C. to study physics. He has\nweathered three years successfully\nand is now studying for a D.l.C. in acoustics.\nDuring his undergraduate days\nNorm's preoccupations matured,\ndealing a fatal blow to his innocence. His interest in soccer led\nto the abandonment of rugby,\nthough on the field his knees often\ntend to act to the contrary, resulting in his captaincy of the Soccer\nClub last year. He still actively\ndemonstrates his varied musical\ntalents being a leading member of\nthe Gilbert and Sullivan Soc. and\nthe I.C. Choir. He was lead singer\nfor the \" Shadies \" Beat Group\nwith whom he cut a disc! On the\nfloor, the \"Scar\" and the \"Shake\"\nare among his strong points, his\nantics being remarkably like those\nof a penguin.\nAn ability to obtain the most\nout of committee meetings is an\nessential quality of a President.\nNorm's experience was gained as\na departmental representative to\nRCS Union, as a members of\nTizard Hall Committee, and the\nWorking Party set up last year to\ninvestigate the structure of the\nVnion, and finally as a member\not I.C. Union Council\u2014an august\nyet workmanlike body of elected\nstudents, ultimately responsible\nfor the running of the Union.\nOne of the President's main objectives this year is to involve\nmore people in the running of\ntheir own Union. In this mammoth task, his permanent grin\n(which at the moment is genuine)\nshould set him well on the way.\nHe's a very friendly character so\ndon't be afraid to approach him\nas he rushes around the College\ntrying to appear busy.\nHis intense desire for the wellbeing of the Union deserves more\nthan a cursory glance, then\u2014back\nto the lab'. The onus rests with\nall of us but especially those entering College this year for the first\ntime.\n\n"

We broke the train\njourney for 24 hours at Munich\nand had a very enjoyable time in\nthe hands of the local scouts there\nwho introduced us to some excellent Bavarian beer at the Opera\nHouse.\nOur first stop in Yugoslavia\nwas at Bled where we stayed for\n3 days in order to find our way\nabout and get acc lim at is ed. Having set up our base camp at Vrsic\n(4500 ft.) we split into three\ngroups and set off to conquer\nsome peaks. We spent several\nnights in mountain huts and cottages belonging to the Yugoslav\nAlpine Club and were made very\nwelcome everywhere once it was\nmade known that we were English\nand not German.\nIn between three or four day\ntrips into the mountains we collected mouse-eared chickweed for\nthe Botany dept. to be sorted by\nour expert, Vic Moss. A fortnight\nin the hills went all too quickly,\neveryone had a good time and\nmost of us got up Yugoslavia's highest peak, Triglav, (9500 ft.)\nThe final port ot call was Krk\n(pronounced as Scottish Kirk)\nwhich we reached by a combination of bus, rail and sea travel,\nspending a night at a students'\ncentre in Rigeka. We spent a pleasant few days on this island\noff the Adriatic coast lazing on\nthe shore and playing tourists,\nnot to mention collecting sea-urchin spines (unintentionally).\nThe return journey to London\ntook 40 hours and apart from a short while in a four wheeled\nwooden-seated Yugocarriage, was\nquite comfortable. Highlights of\nthe trip were the Vesta curry\ncooked in the bog between Venice\nand Milan by Nigel Knowles and\nChris Waterman, and the soup\nand swe:t brewed on the platform\nat Dover while waiting for the\ntrain to Victoria.\nMain topic of conversation on\nthis last lap? Where shall it be\nnext year. Austria or Scandinavia?\nAlso during the year we hold\nregular weekend trips to open\nparts of the country. Why not\njoin us? Come along and see us\nat our stall on Freshers Day.\nR.C.S. Motor Club\nJez in Piccadilly\nThis year one of the star attractions of Freshers Day will unfortunately not be on display.\nThat is the R.C.S. Mascot Jezebel, a1916 Dennis Fire Engine.\nShe suffered severe engine trouble\nwhilst taking part in the Historic\nCommercial Vehicle Club's Brighton run.\nDennis's have kindly allowed\nus to reassemble the fire engine in\ntheir works on Saturdays. We\nneed people prepared to travel to\nGuildford (transport provided) on\nSaturdays throughout the Autumn\nTerm to help with the work.\nThere remains plenty of work\nto be done on the chassis and\nbodywork, at present in the Motor\nClub Garage (behind the Chemistry Building). This work will be\ndone on Wednesday afternoons.\nAnyone who is free at that time\nwill be particularly welcome.\nIf anyone thinks they can help\nthe club in any way they are welcome to coffee in Room 487 Selkirk Hall.\nI.C. FOLK & SQUARE\nDANCING CLUB\nThe Imperial College Folk and\nSquare Dancing Club meets\nweekly on Friday evenings, partners coming from all over London and always outnumbering the\nmale members of the Club\nthroughout the year. Our programme includes American\nSquare dances and Scandinavian\ndances as well as the more usual\nEnglish and Scottish folk dances.\nA new venture has been the\nregular performances of dances\nto music provided by our own\nband. In the Spring term we shall\nagain be attending the annual\nInter-Varsity Folk Dance Rally to\nbe held at Newcastle.\nAnyone wishing for pleasant\nevenings of a different type, unavailable elsewhere in I.C., and\nwho dares to come along can be\nassured of . . . . . ! ! well com\u00ab\nand see !! All budding musicians\njust as welcome.\nHoofs\n& Folks\nLast June a new standard was\nset in I.C. for the quality of recorded material w tih the appearance of the 12-inch LP Kensington Folk Festival 1964. Within\na fortnight of release 70 copies\nwere sold at 25/- each; only a few remain.\nNot only do the performers\nsound truly professional, but the\nrecording engineer is to be congratulated for the clean and precise result. With a pictorial and\nfully annotated cover, even the\nminutest detail was not ignored.\nIn all the record represented a fine reflection of the spirit of the\nI.C. Folk Song Club, at that time\nbarely six months old ! Now ten\nmonths old and with Union backing to boot, the club has an ambitious programme for 1964/5.\nThe first of the fortnightly\nhoot e nannies will be an open\nnight on Thursday, 15th October\n\u2014so bring along your instruments and song-sheets.

But\ncome to our stand at the Freshers'\nexhibition or contact the club's president or secretary via the\nUnion letter rack for full details\nof the club\u2014and watch out for\nour notices (they're the eye-catch-ing ones, we hope).\nEXPLORATION\nSince 1956, 39 expeditions have\nbeen supported by the College to\nplaces as remote as East Greenland and Ethiopia and as far apart\nas the Bolivian Andes and the\nKarakoram. Planning and running such an expedition provides\nexcellent training for organisation,\ntogether with the experience\ngained from living and working\nwith other people in an isolated\nenvironment\u2014;ind, of course, it\nprovides a medium for adventure.\nWould-he explorers at I.C. are\nwell catered for both financially\nand in other ways. Every year\nboth the College and the Union\nmake available a considerable\nsum of money to assist with the\ncost of College Explorations.\nThese funds are administered by\nthe Exploration Board. Having\nmoney so close at hand is a great\nboost, particularly now that competition for support outside the\nCollege has become very keen.\nProposals for expeditions are\nconsidered by the Board in the\nAutumn Term. Some scientific\nresearch is essential nowadays if\nthe expedition is to be justified\nand the Board will need to be\nconvinced that the party is able to\ncarry out its proposed aims. Approval of a particular venture is\ngenerally coupled' with some\nfinancial support. Insurance of\npersonnel and equipment is automatically undertaken by the\nBoard and a certain amount of\nequipment is held for loan to ex-p editions. Help and advice on all aspects\nof mounting expeditions can be\nsought through the Union's Exploration Society\n\n"

    "content": "It was with great regret that we\nlearnt of the death of John Phillips following a climbing accident\nin the Alps. We offer our sincere\nsympathy to his parents and relatives. John Phillips, Nigel Fitzpatrick\nand Gregory Tough were in a party of nine from the I.C. Mountaineering Club which was climbing in the Alps. The three named\nhad set off from Zermatt to climb\nthe Matterhorn, 14,800 ft. (on the\nSwiss-Italian Border) via the\nZmutt Ridge and were a short\ndistance below the summit when\nJohn Phillips fell, it was this fall\nand not exposure, as reported in\nsome papers, that was the cause\nof his death.\nThe two survivors later made\ncontact with a party climbing on\nthe Italian side and were taken\ndown the mountain to a hut to\nreceive medical attention as they\nwere suffering fr qm exposure.\nThey were taken to Milan where\nNigel Fitzpatrick was treated for\nmild frostbite. He was flown back\nto England and it is hoped from\nHALDANE LIBRARY\n13, Prince's Gardens\nSorry!

LIFE IN PICTURES p2 UNION SADLY\nWEAKENED\nResignations\nRock The Boat\nthe latest report that he will soon\nrecover. Gregory Tough has returned to Zermatt to attend the\ninquiry.\nThe suggestion in some papers\nthat the two survivors were poorly\nequipped probably arose from the\nfact that the major part of the\nequipment was carried by Phillips\nand also that a part of the equipment carried by the others was\nlost in extricating themselves from\nthe accident.\nThe College Staff as soon as\nthey heard of the tragedy did all\nin their power to inform and assist\nthe parents concerned.\nJohn Phillips had been a mountaineer from an early age as both\nhis parents are keen climbers. He\nwas one of the most able and\nresponsible members of the\nmountaineering club and had\nbeen elected Transport Officer for\nthis coming year.\nFourteen days after being elected Union Secretary last June\nRoger Withrington resigned. Earlier in the year he had applied for\na post with V. S.O. and was accepted, but due to lack of funds they\nwere unable to send him abroad until 1965. However, he has since\nbeen told that sufficient funds are now available for him to go to\nNigeria immediately. If he had refused the offer it was unlikely\nthat a place would have been kept for the following year, and so\nafter much discussion and worry he has accepted their offer. This\nwas obviously the correct decision for him as he will be teaching\nin Nigeria and he has always intended to take up teaching as his\ncareer.\nAt the moment it appears unlikely that Pete Griffiths, this year's Deputy President will be returning, having been offered a place to\ndo a one-year P.G. course he was unable to get a grant from D. S.I.R. and so signed a contract for a job, again the week after signing this\ncontract he was given a grant by D. S.I.R. and as FELIX goes to\npress is negotiating with the firm to postpone his job for a year.\nThe question now remaining is who will fill these posts ?\nFelix tip for secretary, is Barry Utting.\nFelix tip for deputy president\u2014your guess js as good as ours.\nA dramatic view of the newly opened main entrance\nto City and Guilds.\nPhotographed by John Cawson\n\n"
