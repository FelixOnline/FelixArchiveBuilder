While these stories have\nsome charm to them, it is essential to acknowledge their\nimpactonpricingwithinthefood\nmarket ecosystem. Even stu-dents, who frequent Imperial\u2019s\nFarmers\u2019 Market every Tuesday,\nfind themselves facing steep\nprices for a simple lunch, without the comfort of meal deals or\nbudget-friendly club cards.\nSeven Dials\nSeven Dials Market, nestled in\nthe heart of Covent Garden, recently captured my attention.\nWith its indoor setting and a\nconsistent lineup of 20 stalls,\nthis market offers a diverse\nrange of dishes including pizza,\nbao buns, rice bowls, curries, and cheese plates. Eager to\nexplore, my friend and I sampled the tofu buns from Yun\nBun (\u00a35.50 each) and the kimchi pancakes (\u00a35 each) from\nthe Korean stall Rice On. As we waited for our orders,\nwe marvelled at the bustling atmosphere on the lower\nfloor, where young friends, couples, and small families\nengaged in a communal dining experience. Our taste\nadventure unfolded with the tofu buns, featuring a light,\nfluffy bun enveloping a rectangular piece of fried tofu.\nApart from the mayonnaise, the buns were hopeless,\nwith a lack of flavour. On top of this, the kimchi pancake,\nan interpretation of fried kimchi, fell short with its bland\nfilling encased in an excessively oily exterior.\nDespite the culinary discontent, the lively environment,\nreminiscent of a cozy jazz bar, added to the overall expe-rience, and we left glad that we had given it a try.\nVolont\u00e9\nThe following day, I rendezvoused with a friend for lunch\nat Volont\u00e9, the health-focused caf\u00e9 located on Brompton\nRoad, just a short walk from\nSouth Kensington station.\nHaving discovered it through\nToo Good To Go, I was then\npleasantly surprised by the delightful meal awaiting me. The\ncoffee, though priced at \u00a33.75\nfor an americano, exuded warmth\nand hospitality. The whipped ome-lette, beans, and mushrooms,\npriced at \u00a312.50, could have benefited from a dash more spice, but the\ncrunchy bread complemented the\nbeans sauce well.\nVolont\u00e9, deemed a \u2018hot chicks\u2019 caf\u00e9\u2019\nby some, presents a unique atmosphere with its health-conscious\nofferings, including homemade\ngranola bars, coconut power balls,\nand protein smoothies.

Both establishments, opened within the\nlast few years, boasted comfortable and theme-appro-priate designs, yet neither seemed to beckon for a return\nvisit.

    "content": "Hagata is an insane fusion of Japanese folk and rock complete\nwith traditional Japanese flute and trombone. Making time for\nboth ambient and energetic tracks this album is all over the\nplace in the best possible way. The same can be said for the vocalist who ranges between being whispery and sleep inducing,\nand striking her throat to undulate the pitch. I saw them live last\nyear and they didn\u2019t pull any punches with the flautist changing\nflutes around five times over the performance. I just wish they had\nsome younger fans because I want to join a mosh pit for \u2018Garakuta\u2019\nbefore I die.\nFall Out Boy (FOB) did it again with\ntheir eighth studio album So Much (For)\nStardust, a commentary on life during\nlockdown and the state of the world as it\nis now. The album offers up anthem after anthem, each song storing as much\nenergy in it as any track from their first\nalbum, which was released just over 20\nyears ago in 2003.\nNine out of the 14 tracks on the album\nmade it to my top 50 of 2023 on Spotify, and they renewed my love for the\nheavy, gut-wrenching, soulful songs\nthat are the epitome of the 2000\u2019s punk\nrock genre. Though tracks like \u2018Dance,\nDance\u2019 and \u2018Centuries\u2019 have solidified\nthe band in mainstream pop, So Much\n(For) Stardust does well in returning to\nthe purest essence of FOB.\nListening to Stardust is an almost cinematic experience; the first track opening with an orchestral arrangement,\nwhich is a feature they have used to elevate their music time and time again.\nThe third song on the album,\n\u2018Hold Me Like A Grudge\u2019, is\none of the best rock numbers\nI\u2019ve ever heard, with exceptionally clean drums, bass,\nand guitar, and incredible\nlyrics to boot. Each song\nfeels fresh and keeps you on\nyour toes.\nFall Out Boy are a well-oiled\nmachine, and I was fortunate\nenough to get to see them\nlive at the O2 in November,\non their tour of the album. It\nwas incredible to see them\nperform with so much power and range despite, or perhaps due to, having been at\nit for two decades. The band\nchose to intersperse the\ntracks of Stardust with mostly songs off their earliest\nalbums, taking a trip down\nmemory lane. This sparked\nin me a newfound appreciation for their entire discog-raphy, outside of the tracks I\nfell in love with as a teenag-er, and I\u2019ve been listening to\nthe whole range of their music ever since.\nMaterialising angst in the form of a defiant battle cry against the universe is what\nFOB does best; their lyrics speak not just\nto the 15-year-olds struggling to navigate\nthe rough terrain of high school but also\nto the adults feeling overwhelmed by the\nsheer insanity of today\u2019s social and political landscapes. I would recommend\nhaving a listen to their 2018 EP Lake Effect Kid \u2013 a poetic love letter to their home\ncity of Chicago \u2013 which I listened to a lot\nfollowing the release of Stardust. And I\nwill forever have a soft spot for their last\nalbum MANIA, also released in 2018,\nwhich is one of their most soul-baring\nworks of art.\nZannaBuckland\nSoMuch(For)Stardust\nFallOutBoy\nAfter six years of near-silence, Daughter returns with a lavish,\nsoulful record. The London band augments their usual setup\nwith a far more expansive production, Elena Tonra\u2019s gorgeous\nsinging is joined for the first time by other, stranger voices.\nAs ever though, the lyrics are where Daughter really shine.\nEerie, almost alien imagery fills this album, especially on\n\u2018Neptune\u2019, \u2018Party\u2019, and \u2018Cross The Sea\u2019. An emptiness saturates\nthis record, whether it\u2019s the void of an ocean at midnight or of\na blank phone screen at 3am. Rough Trade named this one of\ntheir top albums of the year, and I have to agree. There\u2019s noone else writing records quite like this.\nDanielHesk\nStereoMindGame\nDaughter Hagata\nTEKE::TEKE\nJohnMatheson\n\ufeff | 19\nISSUE #1840\n\n"

According to The Telegraph, the number of\ndeer in the UK has increased from around 450,000 to\naround 2,000,000 in the last 50 years. This is for two\nreasons \u2013 more deer are surviving winter due to climate\nchange, and humans exterminated their natural pred-ators. According to Reforestation Scotland, overgrazing by this proliferating deer population is the biggest\nthreat to reforestation efforts. Since deer are being\nculled to prevent overpopulation anyway, advocates like\nthe Forestry Society and the British Deer Society claim\nvenison is a sustainable alternative to beef. Imperial calculated that venison emits 27% of the carbon emissions\nof beef. However, according to Our World in Data tofu\nemits 3%, and beans emit 2%, of the carbon emissions\nof beef. Vegan activists, most notably from People for\nthe Ethical Treatment of Animals, wonder why venison\nis being pushed instead of a plant-based diet.\nTo find out more about Imperial\u2019s vegan food, keep an\neye out for the next issue!\nEnvironmental Society campaign meetings\nImperial\u2019s Environmental Society chooses two or three\ncampaigns to promote every academic year.

Many US cities feel this effect keenly, with New\nYork City being one of the worst urban heat islands; its\naverage temperature regularly being measured as up to\n10\u00b0C higher than the surrounding rural areas. Over the\npast decade, NYC has begun to implement adaptation\nmeasures such as \u2018cool roofs\u2019 \u2013 painting rooftops white\nto reflect sunlight \u2013 and urban forestry, by planting more\ntrees throughout the city to create a cooling effect. However, the heat-island effect often disproportionately affects poorer citizens and ethnic minorities, which can\nexacerbate already-difficult living situations. In this\ncase, social-policy interventions are also required, such\nas ensuring equitable distribution of those adaptation\nmeasures and sufficient public facilities for escaping the\nheat.\nUnfortunately, heavy urban development generally\nmeans a huge reduction in local green spaces and biodi-versity, meaning that city-dwellers tend have fewer experiences in nature. City parks, while providing some respite from the concrete of urban jungles, don\u2019t offer quite\nthe same experience that visiting natural environments\nsuch as woodlands outside of city limits do. Access can\nbe restricted to a particular demographic or time of day,\nbiodiversity tends to be low, and maintenance costs are\noften quite high.\nSituated in a tropical region, Singapore has long been\nconsidered one of the greenest cities in the world \u2013 even\nbeing nicknamed \u2018the garden city\u2019 \u2013 with flora being an\nintegral part of most of its urban-design projects. The\ncity\u2019s \u2018Green Mark Scheme\u2019 (GMS) certification encourages building developers to consciously incorporate\nsustainable practices into their construction, and actively design green spaces into their architecture. Many of\nSingapore\u2019s taller skyscrapers feature green platforms\nand biophilic designs, which not only improve the structures\u2019 appearance but also provides additional health\nand well-being benefits to citizens. Environmental consciousness is also taught in the school system, shaping people\u2019s mindsets from a young age. This helps to\nfacilitate the integration of vegetation and wilderness\nthroughout urban-development projects by establishing\nit as a fundamental value among the general populus.\nThe cost of a good city\nI couldn\u2019t write about cities without mentioning Hong\nKong, where I grew up. Though in many ways Hong Kong\nis an extremely well-developed city \u2013 having one of the\ncheapest and most reliable public transport networks in\nthe world and excellent public facilities \u2013 it also has one\nof the widest wealth disparities and is one of the most\nexpensive cities to live in. The cost of living \u2013 how much\nmoney is spent on essential goods \u2013 is a growing problem in most major cities and can only really be solved by\npolicies that directly tackle the costs of these goods \u2013 wa-ter, food, energy, housing, and transportation. These involve trade-offs between a huge variety of stakeholders,\nand so each city will have vastly different approaches to\ntackling this crisis.\nWith the multi-dimensional and multi-cultural nature\nof urban areas comes multi-faceted problems, that require delicate and innovative solutions. These solutions\nmust not only tackle the issues at hand but do so with\nconsideration for socio-economic trade-offs. Citizens\nmust also be made aware of the necessity and long-term\nbenefits of the government spending taxpayer money on\nprojects such as flood management and renewable-en-ergy infrastructure, as this will foster trust in these projects and encourage further sustainable development\ninitiatives.\nAttheirpeak,citiescanbepinnaclesofsustainableliving, providing for the needs of millions of citizens simul-taneously. They can be centres of artistic and scientific\ncreativity, bursting at the seams with the energy of the\npeople that inhabit them and facilitating interactions\nthat transcend sociocultural boundaries. In the most\noptimistic outcome, cities will run entirely on clean,\nrenewable power and gradually allow greenery and wilderness to creep back in, creating space for humanity to\nsustain a good quality of life while also connected with\nthe rest of the natural world. If we can look beyond what\nis already offered in our complex urban ecosystems and\nenvision these utopian futures, there is almost no limit\nto what could be achieved.\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n14 | \ufeff 26 January 2023\nT\nhe first volume of journal Nature Cities was published on 11th\nJanuary, exploring the nuances of\nurban design and planning, and observing the\nenvironmental and socio-economic elements that factor into how cities develop. This comes at a time when\neffective sustainable urban development is not merely\nuseful, but absolutely essential for the stability and success of future generations.\nThe earliest cities \u2013 defined simply as settlements of\ngreater size, population, or importance than towns and\nvillages \u2013 were built by ancient civilisations such as the\nMesopotamians and Egyptians around 5,000\u20136,000\nyears ago. It is even thought that Turkey\u2019s \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, in\nmodern-day Turkey, developed more than 9,000 years\nago, as a coalescence of many smaller villages, forming\nan urbanised community. These cities typically formed\naround the vital resource of water \u2013 usually wide, flowing rivers \u2013 as ancient Egypt\u2019s Memphis did around the\nriver Nile.\nThe cities of today are cultural and financial hubs:\nsymbols of a country\u2019s social values and its economic standing. They are complex systems supporting a\ndense, rich tapestry of civilisation, at varying levels of\nefficiency. The World Bank estimates that more than\n50% of the world\u2019s population currently live in cities,\nand this number is expected to rise, following trends\nin migration for work, the rising costs of living in sub-urbs, and refugee movement through displacement by\nconflict and extreme natural disasters. To keep up with\nthis increase in population density and improve resilience to the effects and threats of climate change, urban\nplanning must be clever and innovative.\nClean energy and condensed farms\nThere is no question that denser city layouts have made\nit easier for city planners to develop infrastructure that\nservices millions of people.\nMaking a complete transition to clean, renewable\nenergy continues to be one of the biggest challenges for\ncities. This is compounded by losses from inefficient\nenergy grids and lobbying by oil- and gas-based energy\nproducers. The feasibility of switching entirely to clean\nenergy is also dependent on whether the surrounding\nlandscape can facilitate the generation of sufficient\npower from renewable sources; for example, the consistently strong winds at the UK\u2019s coastlines allow a huge\namount of energy to be generated by wind turbines, a\nbenefit specific to its particular landscape. Reports by\nBritish Power and the International Hydropower Association have reported that Paraguay, and its capital city\nAsunci\u00f3n, have been running almost entirely on hydroelectric power since late 2022. The country\u2019s Itaipu, Yacyret\u00e1, and Acaray dams even generate enough power\nthat some of it can be exported to neighbouring nations\nsuch as Brazil.\nGiven that farming and agriculture usually require\nlarge areas of land to function, provision of food for the\nvast numbers of people living in cities is challenging\nto say the least, and is usually left to the supermarkets,\nwhich provide the bulk of food for urban households.\nUrban farming \u2013 in gardens, public allotments, or vertical farms (also known as controlled environment\nagriculture) \u2013 has been gaining popularity in recent\nyears. Vertical farms are gaining attention particularly in the Middle East, where, just last year, the world\u2019s\nlargest vertical farm \u2013 Bustanica \u2013 was opened in Dubai,\nUnited Arab Emirates. Thus far, the project has been\nsuccessful, aiming to localise food production and reduce food waste, and it reportedly uses 95% less water\nthan conventional farming. In general, however, urban\nfarming methods are not yet as cost effective as conventional agriculture is, nor are they necessarily more\neco-friendly \u2013 due to the energy intensity of maintaining controlled growing environments \u2013 making it hard\nfor them to be adopted on a wide scale in urban settings.\nOld buildings, new streets\nIncreasing numbers of residents in cities has meant\nincreased demand for affordable housing, which is\nscarce in most urban regions, with pricing being subject to many extraneous factors. It often seems that new\nbuilding projects are preferred over the redevelopment\nof existing vacant buildings, but perhaps the solution to\nthe lack of affordable housing lies in incentivising the\nlatter. This could potentially be achieved by subsidising\nprivate owners for revitalisation projects, as well as improving awareness that these projects would be less car-bon-intensive and could create a stronger community\npresence. Additionally, it might be that more stringent\npolicies are needed to cap prices on the housing market.\nPedestrianisation projects \u2013 reinventing parts of cities to be less car-centric and more pedestrian-oriented\n\u2013 are a particular love of mine. Milan, in Italy, is known\nfor its shopping districts and is a pioneer\nof pedestrianisation, which has resulted\nin lower air-pollution levels, economic\nbenefits for local businesses, and an improved sense of community. In late 2023,\nGiuseppe Sala, the city\u2019s mayor, even proposed a ban on private vehicles entering\nthe city centre in an effort to reduce levels of emissions. Stockholm, in Sweden,\nis planning to tackle its emissions with a\nsimilar ban on petrol and diesel cars in its\ncentre. Both of these are slated to come\ninto effect in late 2024 or\nearly 2025.\nSafety in numbers\nBeing built around rivers or\nnear seas and often being\ndependent on those bodies\nof water, many cities are\nat risk of flooding, owing\nto sea-level rise. This necessitates adaptation measures such as artificial flood\ndefences and the relocation of building developments\nto higher ground. London\u2019s Thames Barrier is a prime\nexample of this; a movable flood barrier managed by the\nUK government and the UK Environment Agency that\ncan be closed when there is a risk of flooding to central\nLondon.\nBarcelona, Spain, is a coastal city that has implement-Cities: t\nto susta\nlivin\nWITH ZANNA\n\n"

It\u2019s also Britain\u2019s most popular party\ndrug. Its use as a treatment for depression is well-known (and demonstrated by systematic reviews and\nmeta-analyses \u2013 Zarate Jr. et al., 2012, Serafini et al.,\n2014). But its positive effects on other mental illnesses\nsuch as generalised anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, and substance abuse is now being realised (Walsh et al., 2021).\nFirst synthesised in the United States in 1962 as a\nmilder alternative to phenylcyclohexylpiperidine (PCP/\nAngel Dust), ketamine has mild psychedelic and dissociative anaesthetic properties that have led to its medical\nuse as an anaesthetic for humans and animals (where\nit earned the moniker \u2018horse tranquiliser\u2019) as well as a\nrecreational drug.\nIngested in a high enough dose, ketamine leads to\nwhat feels like an out-of-body experience, known as a\n\u2018k-hole\u2019.\nK-ing the depression away\nThe brain is comprised of hubs (regions that are highly\nconnected) as well as individual connections between\nbrain tissue. Hubs include regions such as the frontal\nand prefrontal cortex, the thalamus, putamen and the\nhippocampus.\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) causes\nlesions on local tissue, hubs, and the connections between hubs. A particularly important group of\nhubs is the Anterior Cingulate\nCircuitry (ACC).\nStudies have\nshown a direct correlation between\nthe ACC\u2019s size and\nactivity, and the ability to\nfeel pleasure \u2013 making the ACC\nparticularly important in studying\nthe effects of major depressive dis-order.\nSimilarly, the prefrontal and\nfrontal lobe, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and other hubs demonstrate MDD intensity based on brain\nactivity detected there.\nKetamine is particularly effective in increasing the\nneurotransmitter glutamate in several hubs, especially\nthe ACC. Ketamine induced surges of glutamate pro-duction, whih can mitigate symptoms of depression in\nthe short term. Indirectly, ketamine has been shown to\nreduce anhedonia in the dorsal ACC and the OFC by increasing brain activity within those regions of the brain.\nStudies on depressives and those with schizophrenia\nundergoing ketamine treatment demonstrated some\nlevel of greater enthusiasm after a high. (Note that some\nof these studies had participants who were taking lithium and other medication for their disorders previously.)\nOverall, the hubs with the greatest links to MDD were\nshown to positively react\nto ketamine treatment.\nAlthough the literature has not focused on\ndepressives, and looked\nonly at a small sample of\nhealthy males, there is a\ngrowing body of work\nthat suggests that, in\nthe short term at least,\nketamine may be useful\nin mitigating symptoms\nof MDD.\nEmergence in UK party\nculture\nFirst emerging in the UK in the 1990s\nat the peak of party culture, ketamine\nhas become the UK\u2019s most popular party\ndrug, and is a fixture within the clubbing scene \u2013 or so\nI\u2019m told.\nIts popularity amongst 16\u201324-year-olds may be unsurprising to those who can relate to the desire to escape\nthe drudgery of modern Britain (and of course Imperial).\nPersonally, I see it as the ultimate manifestation of\nalienation in the Marxist sense of the word: completely\nshutting off the rat race and banality of consumerism\ninto something where you are no longer yourself for a\nlittle while\nHowever, ketamine is a Class-B drug in the UK, and\npossession may land you up to five years in prison, so I\nam obliged to tell you that a little time in the K-hole may\nend up with a lot of time in the Slammer.\nKetamine: Britain\u2019s unlikely\nparty drug phenomenon\nSCIENCE\nIs ketamine, Britain\u2019s\nunlikely party scene\nstaple, a game-changer\nfor mental health\ntreatment?\nScienceWriter\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nStructural formula of ketamine.

The Health and\nSafety Executive, a government regula-tor, suggests a minimum workplace temperature of 16\u00b0C.\nOccupants complained to the College on 7th\nNovember and were\ninitially told that\nheating would be\nrestored on 9th\n.\nIn the mean-time, a member of\nthe College\u2019s Health\n& Safety team recommended that \u2018a warm\nrefuge\u2019 be provided\nby placing heaters in a\ncommon room, and that\noccupants of cold spaces take\n\u2018regular breaks\u2019 there to recov-er.\nThe College delivered\nspare heaters to the build-ing, but not in sufficient\nnumbers to keep people warm,\nso researchers continued to purchase\nportable heaters at their own expense.\nOn 8th\nNovember, a senior member of\nthe Estates team apologised to the building occupants, assuring them that \u2018we\nhave learnt the lessons from this fiasco\u2019.\n\u2018Simplifying this message, you will\nhave heat on Monday 13th\nNovember\n2023,\u2019 they added, pushing back the date\non which heating would be restored.\nOn the same day, Imperial\u2019s Director of\nEstates Operations responded to an email\naddressed to President Hugh Brady and\nProvost Ian Walmsley, explaining the reasons for the delays.\nHe described the decarbonisation project as a \u2018highly complex undertaking\u2019 requiring \u2018a number\nof contractors\u2019, and\nsaid that one contractor had been\n\u2018overly optimistic\u2019 on completion\ndates.\nRecords obtained by Felix reveal that Imperial\nwas so dissatisfied\nwith the work of\nthe contractors\nthat it \u2018insisted on\na change to [their]\nsenior management\u2019.\n\u2018Technical difficulties with a key\ncomponent\u2019 had\nalso contributed to the\nproblems,\nbut had since been resolved,\nmeaning heating could be\nreturned to the building.\nHeating was restored on\n13th\nNovember as promised,\nbut by the following week,\nit had failed again, and researchers returned to using\nportable heaters.\nThen in early December, a portable fan heater caused a fire in a\nlaboratory.\nThe fire was small and\nquickly doused with a fire\nextinguisher, but the Faculty\nof Natural Sciences Safety\nTeam sent out an email to Life Sciences\nresearchers, banning portable fan heaters\nand instead requiring the use of oil-filled\nradiators.\nThishasfrustratedbuildingoccupants,\nwho feel that not enough has been done\nto provide substitutes for the heaters they\nhave already purchased.\nAs outdoor temperatures plummeted\nlast week, a growing number of PhD\nstudents added their names to an open\nletter penned by Pretorius. The letter,\nwhich currently has 33 signatures, will be\nsent to the President and Provost.\nIt outlines how \u2018multiple heating\nsystem failures\u2019 continue to harm the\nstudents\u2019 health and \u2018compromise\u2019 their\n\u2018research integrity\u2019.\n\u2018Staff and students either sacrificed\ntheir experiments or their health and\nwell-being; the majority of us had little\nchoice but to accept the latter,\u2019 it says.\nIt criticises \u2018inadequate planning\u2019,\n\u2018poor communication\u2019, and \u2018a disturbing\ndisregard for the welfare of our\ncommunity\u2019.\nThe weather has improved over the\npast week, but heating issues remain a\nconcern for researchers.\n\u201cI think people are just at a loss at what\nto do,\u201d said Pretorius. \u201cYou would come in\nevery day \u2013 it was literally below 15\u00b0C.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the research that we\u2019re doing that\nis bringing Imperial its name, credentials,\nmoney and status. But we feel like an\nafterthought in this entire thing.\u201d\nAn Imperial spokesperson apologised\nfor the heating issues in the Sir Ernst\nChain Building, saying: \u2018We are trying to\nresolve [them] as quickly as possible.\u2019\nTo address the campus-wide problems\nwith the temporary heating system in\nthe short term, Imperial said it has \u2018been\nrunning our heating system round the\nclock and distributing plug-in heaters\nto affected areas.

Japan Aerospace Exploration\nAgency (JAXA) proposed the mission back in 2017.\nHigh-precision landing\nThe main aim of JAXA\u2019s mission was to demonstrate a\nhigh-precision lunar landing. As the lander approached\nthe Moon, it was guided by its recognition of lunar cra-ters, applying technology from facial-recognition sys-tems, and was capable of determining its location from\nobservation data collected by the SELENE lunar orbiter\nmission.\nThis allowed SLIM to pinpoint its current position\nand correct its trajectory to reach its landing position.\nSLIM completed landed within 100m of its target loca-tion. In comparison, Apollo 11\u2019s Eagle lunar lander only\nmanaged an elliptic landing accuracy of 20km in down-range and 5km in crossrange.\nJAXA\u2019s deputy director general, Yoshifumi Inatani,\nclaims such precise landings will enhance the quality of\nfuture space exploration.\nOngoing power outage\nWhile SLIM landed on the Moon with incredible preci-sion, JAXA\u2019s lander is in serious jeopardy. Upon landing,\nSLIM suffered a technical issue with its solar panels,\nwhich resulted in them being oriented westward at the\nstart of the lunar day.\nThe lander is capable of running on an internal battery power source for a short period of time: this was\nshut off just three hours after landing to prevent its\noverdischarge. Operators at JAXA hope the lander will\nbe operational in a few days once the spacecraft\u2019s panels\nreceive the sunlight needed to generate its electricity.\nObservers of the mission have suggested SLIM may\nhave potentially rolled during touchdown. The target\nsite is elevated at a 15-degree angle slope. Operators\nhave said that not enough data is available at present to\nestablish the probe\u2019s orientation.\nSLIM\u2019s science objectives - looking for\nolivine on the surface\nIf SLIM powers up, operators at JAXA have coordinated\nit to use its onboard camera, the spacecraft\u2019s only scientific payload, to investigate the geology of the Moon.\nOne of SLIM\u2019s goals with its camera is to look for a mineral called olivine in the Moon\u2019s mantle. Back in 2010,\nJAXA\u2019s lunar orbiter SELENE mapped out a total of 34\nolivine-rich sites on the Moon using spectroscopy data.\nOlivine exists deep within the Moon\u2019s mantle, but\nhuge meteoroid impacts have exposed it to the lunar\nsurface.\n\u201cIf we can detect the olivine\u2019s components and compare it with its counterpart on Earth, it may offer new\nevidence to support the theory that the Moon was part\nof Earth long time ago,\u201d says JAXA program manager\nShinichiro Sakai.\nRegardless of the challenges that SLIM currently\nfaces, the mission has undeniably been a success. Its\ngroundbreaking landing showcases the effectiveness of\nits innovative new image-based automatic navigation\nsystem.\nIf the spacecraft eventually overcomes its current\nhurdles and powers up as intended, its onboard camera\nwill play a crucial role in furthering our understanding\nof the Moon\u2019s geology. SLIM also carried two mini-rov-ers, LEV-1 and LEV-2, which were deployed as planned\nand will continue to operate on the lunar surface.\nSLIM lands on the Moon: Japan sets the\nrecord for our most precise lunar landing yet\nSCIENCE\nScienceEditor\nTAYLOR POMFRET\nJapan becomes the\nfifth country to land on\nthe Moon, joining the\nranks of the US, India,\nRussia and China.\nSLIM landing site, the Shioli Moon crater, pictured by Apollo 16.\nThe large foreground crater is Theophilus, and the crater behind it\nin which Shioli resides is Cyrillus.

There are kernels of truth in these pre-conceptions. But, if there is one that rings particularly\nfalse, it would be that, beneath its austere atmosphere \u2013\nexposed-concrete buildings, scaffolded monument, and\nrusting ambiguously shaped statue \u2013 lies a wasteland for\nthe arts. Or, at best, they are relinquished to unimpor-tance: filler for real conversations, about the sciences.\nAn abundance of artistic and creative societies\nthankfully subvert this notion. However, as often is the\ncase, it\u2019s not just the now we\u2019re talking about, but an\nidentity formed over years. Fortunately, as history would\nillustrate, not everyone at Imperial has fit into the mould\nof a \u2018scholar of the Sciences\u2019.\nOne such person was H. G. Wells, a student of\nbiology between 1884 and 1887, at a time when Imperial was still the Royal College of Sciences. Wells founded\nthe Science School Journal, which was created as a place\nto unite and share the range of thought and art that was\npresent in the college at the time. (This journal would go\non to become The Phoenix, evolving into the student-led\nnewspaper known as Felix that you read right now.) It\nwas in this journal that Wells published the short story\n\u2018The Chronic Argonaut\u2019, the first iteration of his revolutionary novel, The Time Machine, a landmark of science\nfiction. Though Wells failed his final year exams and\nultimately never obtained his degree in biology, he later\nwent on to be named an Honorary Fellow of the college.\nToday, Felix remains an outgrowth of this,\nsustaining a relationship between the arts and the\nsciences for students. A place for students with a passion for writing and journalism across different fields to\ncome together and present their work to a large reader-ship.\nHowever, the argument is still to be made that Imperial has a need to let the arts to run deeper through its core\nidentity. As a man with great visions of the future, Wells\nforesaw this. It is the need to display how the arts and\nthe sciences reflect and spur each other on. This common harmony, between creativity and innovation, is required to truly and fully examine the human condition.\nMore importantly, there should a community for that,\nin order to develop both. Wells had dedicated himself\nto creating the Science Schools Journal in order to fulfil\nthese convictions. It is down to us to resurrect the idea\nof a school magazine of the Arts, or as it was called, The\nPhoenix.\nBOOKS\nA brief history, and a\ncall to The Phoenix\nBooksHistorian\nGEORGE MOREAU\nThe Time Machine.
