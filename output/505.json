    "content": "Railway Dispute\nDue to the RaiIwaymens' dispute,\na number of students have been unable to\nget in and out of college. If you live very\nfar away and are having difficulty, Crash\nPad is open for anyone who wants to use it.\nPlease see Malcolm in the Union Office as\nsoon as possible to give us some idea of the\nnumber of people likely to be involved.\nWe would also be very grateful if anyone living out of London who commutes by\ncar who would be willing to give anyone living nearby a lift during the dispute would\ntell Annie in the Union Office. Int: 2232.\nCrash Pad Open\nPage 11\nYour Rights as a Licencee, Tenant etc.\nNow that you have found somewhere to live, you may occasionally wonder what your chances are of staying there if your landlord\ntakes a sudden dislike to you. ( an he just put your belongings out\ninto the street and change the locks, or is there more to it than that?\nParliament, through a series of Rent and other Acts, has evolved\na system of protection which varies in strength with the kind of accommodation that you occupy, but unfortunately it is often difficult\nto decide which particular category you fall into.\nThe two main categories of accommodation for this purpose are\nlicences which can be terminated with very little notice after which\nyou have no protection at all, and tenancies where there are varying\ndegrees of protection.\nLicences include rooms in hotels and hostels, genuine bed and\nbreakfast arrangements and places where the landlord or his agents\nhave free access, without reference to you, to all parts of the\naccommodation that you occupy. If you are given an agreement\nwhich calls itself a licence, this does not necessarily make you a licence e but if the arrangement of the accommodation is such that\nyou don't have a room to yourself, and the agreement contains a clause to the effect that the landlord has the right to move one of\nyou out and move in a replacement and if each share r signs a separate agreement, then it is quite possible that this would make you\na licence e. Rooms in a hall of residence are also usually licences. When a licence is terminated, you become, in effect, a squatter.\nThis means that although the landlord cannot use force to evict\nyou, there is nothing to stop him changing the locks while you are\nout.\nAll other types of accommodation count as tenancies which means\nthat your landlord can't get rid of you without a possession order\nfrom the courts. In addition you are entitled to adequate notice of\nthe landlord's intention to rescind his arrangement with you, so,\nexcept in the case of a tenancy for a fixed period, the landlord must\ngive 28 days notice in writing before he can even start applying for\na possession order. Any other attempt by the landlord to exclude or\nh arras s you constitutes a criminal offence for which he can be pro-<\ns ecu ted by the local council.\nSo, what are the chances of the court granting a possession order\nto a landlord who has given you a valid notice to quit?\nThere are a number of cases where the court will almost certainly\ngive an order. These include tenancies of places which used to be\nthe landlord's residence and he wants to live there again or wants\nit for members of his family who used to live there or if he bought\nthe house as a retirement home and now wants to retire there. In\nboth cases the landlord is meant to notify you of any such intention\nat the beginning of the tenancy, in writing, but the court can dispense with this requirement. Other cases are where you signed an\nagreement to stay for a period \"of less than eight months in an out\nof season holiday letting or if the letting is for the purpose of a holiday (though you might sometimes be able to argue that it was\nclearly not let for any such purpose). The same applies to student\nletting s where the landlord is the college or university; places with\na very high rate able value or extremely low rent and council and\nhousing association owned property. Another example of this is\nwhere the landlord offers you suitable alternative accommodation.\nIf you are a tenant and your landlord lives in the same building\n(so long as the place is not a purpose built block of flats) the court\nwill grant a possession order unless you apply to the rent tribunal\nbefore the expiry of the notice period. To find out how to do this\ncontact the welfare centre or the housing department at your town\nhall. The Rent Tribunal can grant you an extension of up to six\nmonths. At the end of that period you can reapply but once the\ntribunal protection is exhausted a possession order will be granted.\nThere are a number of cases in which a court might gr aut an order\ndepending on all the circumstances - usually where you are in bread i in your tenant's obligations. For example, if you fail to pay rent,\nbreak a condition in the lease, damage the furniture, sublet or as sign without your landlord's permission, allow the place to be used\nfor illegal purposes or if you annoy the neighbours by making too\nmuch no ice or some other anti-social act. Other instances are where\nyou have given notice that you intend to leave to the landlord and\nthen changed your mind, if as a result of your not leaving the landlord would lose out and where the landlord (who didn't live there be-fore) wants the place for himself or for a member of his family.\nIn this case, however, an order will only be granted if the court\nthinks that greater hardship would be suffered by the landlord if you\nwere allowed to stay than would be suffered by you if you had to\nlook elsewhere.\nIn most other cases than those outlined above you would have\nsecurity of tenu ie for as long as you wanted to stay there so long\nas you fulfill your obligations. Owing to the complexity of this\nsubject, the above can only be a rough guide and if you are threatened with eviction you should seek advice at the Welfare Centre\nwith reference to your particular circumstances.\nMichael Arthur\nWelfare Adviser\n\n"

    "content": "Page12, TWO COLD DAYS IN DECEMBER While most I.C. students were Christmas shopping, recovering\nfrom hangovers, or even revising (?) for Christmas tests, an intrepid party of four and two members of the academic staff made their\nways to Goldsmith's College in Lewisham for the Annual Conference of the World University Service (UK). ICU is an affiliate of WUS\n(UK), an organisation which actively helps the needs of students,\nin particular worldwide.\nWUS is an international organization which traces its roots to the\n1920s to a group called European Student Relief. This was mainly\nconcerned with the situation of war-affected academics and tried to\nalleviate their problems. The group adopted its present name in the\n1950s and now concentrates on projects which will benefit communities as a whole. WUS is dedicated to the freedom of thought and\naction in education (a term taken in its widest possible sense by\nWUS) and pursues this aim by encouraging educational bodies, such\nas universities, to act responsibly socially. Hence WUS opposes all\ndiscrimination, exploitation and injustice in education and, where\nit can, takes action.\nThe UK branch of WUS concentrates on the needs of overseas\nstudents, particularly refugees in this country, and to a smaller\nextent in providing information to the public, the Government and\nits members. Help is given, when requested, in setting up projects\nwhereby say a university WUS group assists a village in the Third ,\nWorld independently of WUS, though with its support.\nAs the 1978 Treasurer, Mr. Bill Robertson of I.e., reported WUS\n(UK) is an educational charity. Approaching \u00a33 million was spent\nin 1977/8, but the importance of this money lies in the use to which\nit'has been put. The Government, through the Overseas Development\nMinistry and WUS, supports Chilean, Ugandan, Ethiopian and IndoChinese refugee students in the UK and African students at the\nUniversity of Rhodesia. Through charitable trusts and individual\ndonations, aid is given to Kurdish students in the UK and Palestinian and Nepalese students overseas. I.C. collected \u00a3500 for WUS\nduring registration last term; simi lar col lect ions were held around\nthe country. Some university and college WUS groups even finance\nscholarships themselves. College authorities assist by waiving fees\nfor needy students. However, Bill Robertson warned against over-dependence on finance from Government sources, which might not\nalways be forthcoming.\nNebulous\nRichard Luce, MP, Shadow Minister for Overseas Development\nspoke about \"Human Rights and Educational Aid\". He began by\nemphasising that human rights' problems are basic but \" nebulous\". Having laid down certain conditions for considering human rights,\nin particular that condemnation of inhumane regimes must be irrespective of the political complexion of the particular regime (e.g. Soviet Union and Iran), Mr. Luce went on to say that human rights'\nproblems have to be dealt with country by country with due regard to\nhistorical, strategic and economic factors. This contradictory standpoint was typical of a speech that asked many questions, but answered very few; it seems strange for a Shadow Minister not to be\nfull of possible solutions to such basic (but \" nebulous\") problems.\nHowever, Mr. Luce made several points that are worth repeating.\nIn principle he expressed support for voluntary organizations, such\nas WUS.Oxfam and Amnesty International, who can gain credibility\nabroad by being polit call y neutral. Such charities are vital since\nthey have the organization to bypass regimes and distribute aid and\neducation where needed, i.e. the people, efficiently and at short\nnotice. In most cases it would be difficult for the Government to do\nthis while working with the regime in question. At the moment,\nrefugee students are officially classed as overseas students and\nthere is no Governmental strategy for refugees, particularly in reg aid to education.Mr. Luce suggested that human rights policy should be\ninstitutional is ed in Britain and that in the long-term refugees should\nbe helped so that they could return home.\nTuition Fees\nThe Rt. Hon. Shirley Williams, MP, gave a speech on \" Education for Overseas Students\". After reaffirming her strong belief that the ie should be a\" substantial proportion of overseas students\" in Bri tish further education, she outlined the Government's strategy in\nthis area. This includes, as described in FELIX last week, that\nthe \" hidden subsidy\" of \u00a3100 m towards overseas student fees from\nthe Government should be used \" positively\" to help \" selected groups\" particularly from developing countries. This would mean\nthe others would have to pay more, and the Minister suggested\nmeans-testing and academic scholarships to help those less well off. ( NB ICU is opposed to both of these).\nMrs. Williams echoed Mr. Luce' s point that a systematic approach\nfor overseas students and refugees is needed and emphasised that\nadmissions are the responsibility of the academic world and not of\nimmigration officers.\nWorkshops\nBetween speeches and conference business, three workshops took\nplace. Unfortunately, very little was achieved in terms of new policy\nor new ideas, since most of the time was spent in defining the problem to be discussed. This was due to the wide range of experience\n(or lack of it) between the delegates. Hence the WUS workers leading the workshops tended to dominate; a position shown in the\nresolutions prepared by each workshop, which on the whole,support-ed the present work of WUS and its workers. .\nThis year ICU has collected about \u00a3500 for WUS and organised\nan Anti Racialist Week. However, there is no WUS group in ICU and\nconsequently External Affairs Committee are responsible for WUS\naffairs in ICU. So anyone interested in WUS, and its affairs, is we l come to contact Sheyne Lucock for more information.\nIC Delegates: Mr. Bill Robertson, Dr. Leo Pyle, Mary Attenborough\nSheyne Lucock\nIC Observers: Dilip Kumar, Tim Hillyer\nMotion on Iran\nUGM Motion on Housing\nElection of Chairperson\nBye- law changes\nGreat Hall l pm Tuesday 23rd Jan\n\n"

Because their\naction did not amount to a strike, College was still paying up to \u00a325,000 per week in\nwages to idle staff.\nThe settlement gives ASTM S members the\nextra five days' annual leave which they\nwere demanding, giving them parity with\nacademic related staff. It was the granting\nof extra leave to academic related staff\nlast year which led to the similar demand\nby ASTM S members. The agreement will be\nreviewed in the case of any future revision of leave entitlement for academic related\nstaff.\nCollege has also agreed to a phased programme of implementation of the Safety Policy and a detailed examination of the safety position in each department. ASTM S is to\ncooperate in this and has assured the College\nthat it cannot see any future circumstances\narising in which action on safety matters\nwill be combined with industrial action on\nnon-safety matters.\nI CAST MS Secretary Arthur Sier told a meeting of the union last week that the\nagreement was \" a considerable victory\" for ASTM S.He said that members must keep\nup the momentum on safety and look out for\nany unsafe equipment.\nAs a result of the agreement normal working has been resumed.\nOne matter which held up the resolution\nof the dispute for two days was the question\nof Pam Martins, a Metallurgy Department\nphotography technician, whom ASTM S claimed was being victimised for her part in the dispute. A statement was finally signed\nby Lloyd Thomas on behalf of the Department giving an assurance that \" it will return to the status quo that existed before\nthe dispute.\". The dispute over holidays started in June\nlast year and is therefore probably the long est dispute involving a whole section of\nstaff in British university history. I CAST MS stepped up the dispute in November\nby taking action over College Safety Policy. At an 8 hour meeting between College and\nASTM S on Friday 5th January under the\nchairmanship of a Conciliation Officer of the\nAdvisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Serv ice( AC AS) agreement was reached in principle on leave entitlement parity for the\ntechnical staff. Further discussions extended the agreement to other ASTM S members\nin college.\nSimilar disputes in other London Colleges have not been settled. ASTM S accepted that\nthe agreement would not set a precedent for\nstaff in other colleges or universities. con td. from front page\nat IC before the summer.\nIC is at present the only London College producing an Alternative Prospectus. The\nConference would explore the possibility of UL U publishing an AP for the whole university or of other colleges producing their\nown publications. College Fires\nTwo small fires broke out in college last week but both were extinguished before the\narrival of the fire brigade.\nThe first occurred on Wednesday in the\nChemical Engineering Department. A postgraduate in a level 5 laboratory was working with the chemical tetra hydro fur an which\noverheated and caught fire causing a small\namount of damage to the fume cupboard. Two\npostgraduates using hand-held fire extinguishers managed to put out the flames before the fire brigade arrived on the scene. The fire on Friday lunchtime was slightly\nmore serious. Contractors carrying out repairs to the lightning conductor on the roof\nof Mines were using a propane gas cylinder\nand torch. Gas escaping from the cylinder\ncaught fire setting light to a tarpaulin and\ndamaging a fume cupboard extractor hood.\nCollege staff ran out a fire hose from\nlevel 4 of the building and extinguished the\nflames. The fire brigade .arrived in time to\nfinish the job. Damage is estimated at \u00a3100.\nThe only entry for Crossword No. 503 was from Ginny\nWhite in College Administration.

Rep. has resigned, I have to elect a new one for the rest of this session .\nThe papers went up on Monday and will remain up for another week.\nI'm hoping to have the hustings on Tuesday 30th January somewhere\nin Mines and the election on Monday 5th Feb., which is by ballot\nbox. So if you're in Min. Re s.Eng. then think about standing for Dep.\nRep. - also remember the Dep. Rep. elections for next year are also\nnigh, with papers going up on 5th February.\nClub Insurance\nAt the moment I'm chasing up all clubs as to what insurance they'\nve got, so there is some central record of it - I 've sent out letters\nto all you club captains/chairmen and if you haven't replied to my\nletter yet, then pull your finger out and do it, for it's most imp or tant.\nUGM\nYour big chance to exercise your democratic right comes on\nTuesday with a UGM at 1pm in the Great Hall; and is packed with\nsuch goodies as the election of a chairperson and a motion on\nstudent housing and the possibility of naked bodies writhing on the\nfloor is an eternal ecstasy; although the latter isn't confirmed yet.\nWell that about wraps it up for this week, so I hope to see all you\npeople at the U GM; stay cool, Mel Kinkie (an ag.)E.

If you do get too cold you can\nalways nip up to the union office (which is very warm).\nWELFARE DAY Just to prove that the union carries on against all odds we are\norganising a Welfare Day on Wednesday January 31st12.30 onwards\nin the Junior Common Room. There are discussions planned on\ntopics such as; Consumer Rights,for which we have invited the\nConsumers Association and West London County Court (to explain\nthe small claims procedure), Housing rights,for which Shelter Ho using Aid Centre has been invited, Police and the law, for which the\nlocal police and Release have been invited, Social Security,for\nwhich the Department of Health and Social Security have been\ninvited (to explain their excessive bureaucracy) etc. etc. etc.\nThe Welfare Centre will be there as well as the Health Centre\nand the Student Counsellor.\nBEER If you think that you have no problems and are never likely to have\nany you can still go to Welfare Day to get some free beer although\none thing that must interest everybody (except us lucky research\nstudents) is exam, study technique, which Dr. Haines, the Health\nCentre Director, is an expert on and has agreed to do a talk.\nSEX If you aren't interested in beer or exams, you must be interested\nin sex. There will also be information on contraception provided by\nthe Family Planning Association and abortion by the British Pre g nancy Advisory Service to say nothing of the controversial sex\neducation film \" Growing Up\". All this and some silly games too !\n(relay teams needed for condom blowing competition - apply to\nUnion Office for details)\nUnion Meeting\nDon't forget is on Tuesday at 1.00pm in the Great Hall.

An Historic City\nHow did you spend your time yesterday, can you remember?\nIt was a Tuesday and below freezing point in London. She had\nbeen half an hour late in meeting him, but the wait had been worthwhile for her dark shining hair was perfection and in any case, the\nthought of being stood up had been too awful to contemplate.\nHe had brought a camera, and after a meal together took pictures\nof her in Brunswick Square. They had not known each other long,\nand now, as he studied her face for the best profile, the right expression, he realized just how different she had seemed in the light of\nthe gas fire as they had snuggled closely together. That night, whether due to the light or, perhaps, mental association, she had seemed\nthe perfect image of a former girlfriend.\nThey caught the tube so as to spend the last hour together which\nthey spent strolling around Regents Park. It was so picturesque. Ice\ncovered the lake, and the cold drew their frozen bodies together for\nwarmth. Passing through iron gates, they climbed a knoll and sat\ndown. London sprawled before them.\nHer voice assured him that they would meet again, and feeling\nbetter he rested his head on her shoulder. She felt compelled to\nremain passive. Days later their respective terms would start. For him it would be\na BSc. at Imperial, and for her aBA in French at Dumam. Their\nlives contained different friends, different opportunities, different\nhardships. What had made them choose such different universities?\nPerhaps for one it was the collegiate system and the historic city,\nand for the other maybe the academic reputation and the West End. No one will ever know. One can only guess at the factors that influenced their decisions; friends, headmasters, the college prospectus\nor the alternative prospectus. Yet ask either, and they'll happily\ntell you which of the above brought them together. At Baker St.,\nwith red tulips under her ami, she disappeared.\nTo help with the information given to schools and prospective\nScience and Technology students, the Union publishes an Alter native Prospectus each year. Written by student representatives,\nthis gives a consumers guide to higher education, and Imperial\nCollege.

This year's edition is being completely rewritten to\nbring it up to date. Also, for the first time, the prospectus will be\nor The West End?\nmade more attractive and appealing to read due to the new facilities available. One part is to be devoted to students' daily routines as\nwe are sure that this would be useful information for prospective\nstudents.\nIf you .would like to write half a side of A4 detailing things such\nas your accommodation and its condition, rent, travel arrangements,\nfares, lectures, work load, eating and social life, we would be very\ngrateful. I do ask you to spend a little of your time in the knowledge\nthat your contribution would be of great help to those of us who will be spending a lot of our time working on the publication, and to\nthose who can only imagine what life here is like.

    "content": "TM\nAM\nPM\nis Transcendental Meditation, a simple, natural, effortless\ntechnique practised:\nonce in the morning\nand once again in the evening.\n.Page 13\nTM is something very ^practical and is backed up by over 600\nscientific research* studies on the psychological, physiological and\nsociological changes taking place as a result of regular practice.\nFinally it should be recalled that the technique is extremely easy\nand effortless. It is NOT a form of concentration or contemplation,\nnor does it require a change in diet or life style. It is not a religion\nand doesn't require faith or belief.\nIf you are interested and would like to hear more about TM then\nplease come to our talk on Tuesday 23January in l Me ch.Eng. Room\n664. The talk will last about 40 - 50 minutes. Please bring any\nquestions you have.\n* Scientific Research on the Transcendental Meditation Program:\nCollected Papers Vol. 1. Ed. by David W. Orme-Johnson and John\nT. Farrow. MERU Press.\nBoth times one meditates for 1 5 - 2 0 minutes sitting in a comfortable chair with the eyes closed. TM produces a deep level of mental relaxation and physical\nrest. As a result of this deep rest, the mind becomes clearer,\nmore alert; its ability to solve problems, remember information,\nand make intelligent decisions improves. Also the body gets rid of\ndeep stresses and fatigue and gains greater energy and efficiency,\nmind-body co-ordination improves and we enjoy better health.\nIs it worth sacrificing 40 minutes a day to relax? Isn't life hectic\nenough without having to make up those 40 minutes by being busier\nthan ever? The point is that though meditations are pleasant periods\nof profound relaxation, it is for the benefits of TM that people medi-tate. After meditating one feels refreshed - especially noticeable\nafter a tough day. For example: one may get home after a busy day\n(perhaps feeling a little tired), invest 20 minutes in meditating then\nreap the benefits by being able to spend the rest of the evening to\nthe maximum advantage and enjoyment; whether it be a trip to the\ncinema, an evening out with friends, this weeks problem sheet/lab\nreport, or whatever. So, far from losing out on 40 minutes a day, one\nis able to accomplish more, more efficiently, during our activities. Thus it is that TM is exceptionally useful to the busy life at I.C. and the practice of it in no way involves wasting time, time which\nwe cannot afford to ill spend. \u00a310 COMPETITION\nFollowing last weeks article, there has been a change to the\nconditions of the slide competition being organized by I.C. Photo graphic Society. As college will want to keep selected slides for.\ntheir permanent' show', they will take copies of these slides, and\nthe original* will be returned to their owners - i.e. everyone will get their original slides back.\nAs before, we are looking for any slides( in a:2\" x2 \"mount),\nrelated to Imperial College. There is a \u00a310 prize for the best slide( judge to be announced) and the closing date is Tuesday 27th February. I hope that two members of the Committee, who shall be nameless , are now happy and will accept your entries at the\nPhotosoc shop (see What's On). They can also be handed in at\nany Meeting, or to me, if you can find me.\nSelected slides are to be used in a slide show by the Rector\nin the summer, and will be kept as a permanent collection for\nmembers of staff to take to schools etc.\nTim Ellison Chem Eng2 Amnesty Internationa\nCarniel Budiardjo was born and raised in\nBritain, met and married her Indonesian husband in Europe and in 1952 settled with him\nin Indonesia. Mr. Budiardjo had a government\njob and she joined the Foreign Ministry.\nIn 1965 there was an anti-communist\ncounter-coup in which, it has been es tim at ed, about one million people were killed\nand half-fi-million imprisoned. Since then\nmany thousands have been imprisoned\nwithout trial or charge, many of them not\neven directly connected with the communist\nattempted coup or the communist party.\nIn the purges that followed the Budiardjos\nwere dismissed and Mr. Budiardjo was im priv so ned. He was freed in late 1967 but in September 1968, the army arrived to arrest Mrs.\nBudiardjo herself. Her husband happened to\nbe in the house at the time and so, despite\nhis carrying a document declaring his unconditional release, he was arrested also. Eventually, due entirely to efforts by\nAmnesty, Mrs. Bjdiardjo was released in\nNovember 1971 and allowed to return to\nBritain, where she has been campaigning\nfor the release of other Indonesian political\nprisoners ever since.

    "content": "Kings Frozen Out\nisp ii 1 in ill 2\nby IC Fourths\nIn wintry conditions and despite the\ninclusion of several Fifth team players\nI.C. Fourths put up a spirited performance\nagainst Kings Thirds at Colliers Wood.\nThe game began with Kings on the attack\nbut the I.C. defence held out well with Al\nCable and Phil Lakin performing well in the\ncentre and Barry Witts catching anything\nthat came through.\nAs the first half progressed, midfield players Bill Caffyn and Adam Esberger began to\nget a grip on the game. A sustained period\nof pressure culminated in Steve Marten wrong\nfooting the keeper and scoring I.C. Fourths\nbest away goal of the season.\nAlmost immediately from the centre I.C. were on the attack again. James Rowley\nheaded to Patrick O' Kelly who beat the full\nback and then crossed superbly for Steve\nSims to score an excellent goal.\nAfter half time Keith Rake replaced Steve\nSims to add more weight to the midfield.\nShortly after this, Bill Caffyn was injured\nafter making a brave challenge foiling an\nalmost certain goal.\nWith I.C. now down to ten men and facing\nuphill, Kings applied further pressure forcing Veteran Steve Veats and strong man Pete\nWalker to make some brave tackles.\nWith fifteen minutes to go Kings scored\nfrom a corner, but I.C. contained further\nattacks and James Rowley nearly scored on\nthe break but his effort was cleared from\nthe line.\nAs the sun faded in the west referee John\nHealy blew the final whistle and I.C. Fourths\nhad two more valuable points.\nFinal Score: I.C. IV'2 Kings III'si\nTeam: Barry Witts, Steve Veats, A! Cable,\nPhil Lakin, Pete Walker, Bill Caffyn, Adam\nEsberger, Steve Sims (Keith Rake), Paddy\nO 'Kelly, James Rowley, Steve Marten\nMatch Reporter: Barry Witts\nLJS.E. II 1 IC III 5\nI JC.3 rds started the second half of the\nseason with an excellent win away to L.S.E., under almost arctic conditions. The pitch\nwas extremely hard due to frost, and was\ncovered by an inch of snow. Despite having\nseveral very big men in the team, I.C. kept\ntheir footing much better than L.S.E. and,\nalthough failing to score in the first half,\nproduced some excellent football which\ntheir opponents failed to equal.\nThe non-appearance of Zambian star\nOllie P is enabled I.C. to call upon the\nservices of first team player Brian Davies,\nwho responded with some excellent play in\nmid-field along with Alan Donaldson, Adrian\nClarke and Ken M cP hail, I.C. came close to\nscoring on several occasions in the first\nhalf.none closer than when Peter Twigg was\nbrilliantly tackled by Dave M cP hail on the\nedge of the L.S.E. penalty area when threatening to score.\nHowever it did not take long for I.C. to\nscore in the second half when, in the first\nattack, the L.S.E. keeper could only parry\na shot from Dave M cP hail and Dave Hall hit\nhome the loose ball. This goal only resulted\nin some very lethargic play from I.c., and\nL.S.E. deservedly equalized after a moment\nof slackness in the I.C. defence, following\na period of fierce pressure. I.C. continue d to live dangerously for a while but when\nAlan Donaldson rose above the L.S.E. defence to head home a corner, the home\nside lost heart and I.C. went on to an excellent win. The pleasing feature about the I.C performance was the all-round teamwork,\nwith every player making a significant\ncontribution to the game, and on this form\nI.C. have the beating of all the other teams\nin the league.\nAfter match conversation was based on\nreassuring L.S.E. that this really was I.C.3 rds and, with one exception, not a mixture\nof I.C. first and second teams. Perhaps we\nshould thank them for the 'compliment'.\nTeam: George Okuniewski, Cyril Knowles,\nGiles Brereton, Peter Twigg, Dec McCruckin,\nBrian Davies, Adrian Clarke, Ken McPhail,\nAlan Donaldson, Dave Hall, Dave McPhail.\nRUGBY- Firsts Slaughter R.A.F.I. C.1ST62 R.A.F. UXBRIDGE 3\nAfter the Christmas break everyone was\nbound to be unfit - and with a couple of\nexceptions this was the case. What was\nneeded was a good hard game to tone\neverybody up - unfortunately we were\nplaying R.A.F. Uxbridge (say no more!).\nAfter an uneventful coach journey we\narrived at the base to find what appeared\nto be brand new changing rooms - many of\nthe team had never seen such luxury, especially Steve Ciunn who lives in a pig\nstye so we understand.\nAnyway we all changed, ran onto the\npitch, kicked off, and the slaughter began.\nScoring was so easy that it was hard for\nI.C. to maintain concentration. However,\ntries came at regular intervals and the score\nescalated to 32-3 at half-time. Yes, they\nactually scored 3 points from a penalty\nbeneath our posts!\nThe second half continued as the first\nhalf had finished off and by full time the\nabove total had been clocked up. The only\nevents to break the boredom being a snow\nshower and M. Cotter being warned by the\nreferee not to make the opposition look like\nfools. At one time Bas, our travelling lines man, was slide tackled by one of their players and ended up on his back waving his\nflag - not a pretty sight!\nIt must be said that had we played to our\nfull extent the score would have been over\n100- and this was not achieved because too\nmany tries were missed due to dropping the\nball etc.\nAfter the game we spent a long time in\ntheir bar (25 p per pint, 18p per short)\nthanks to a great coach driver - enough said!\nTry Scorers: M. Cotter .?, M. Russel 2, D. Lilley 2, E. Budgen 1 and 7 conversions,\nJ. Chanoller I,J. Wright I,P. Goring 1,\nR. Smart 1\nFootnote:\nThis tei m has seen the retirement of three\ngreat Welsh players - Gerald Davis, Gareth\nEdwards and Jerry Swain. We wish them\nluck! Steve Townsend\nPage 15\nFifth's HalfTime Summary\nAs Christmas approached the Fifth's pulled off two fine 2-1 wins against very\nstrong opposition in the form of R.S. M. II\nand Chelsea3 rds. These results brought\nthe team's record for the term to Played16 Won 13 Drawn 1 and Lost2; both defeats\nwere incurred when players had to be loaned\nto higher teams to keep them going.\nIn the Cup the Fifths are through to the\nquarter-finals to be played later this term.\nFollowing tough encounters against both\nCharing Cross 2nds and R.S. M. II. The\nlatter game was particularly notable for a\" Je kel and Hyde\" performance by Stu Dil lon, who was unable to do anything right in\nthe first-half, but after a few ' React ivan' tablets at half-time proceeded to bemuse\nthe opposition defence and score a brill i ant hat-trick. Damion Kelly also has reason\nto remember this match as he scored probably one of the finest goals ever seen at Harlington. This result probably, along with the\nvictory over I.C.3 rds( sorry Cyril), were the\noutstanding performances of the term.\nAs for players, Alan Cable (the captain)\nis probably the most outstanding and could\neasily be in the First' s if he wanted to.\nWhen playing alongside Phil Lakin the\ncentral defence looks as solid as Fort Knox.\nPhil has done a brilliant job at centre-half\nand has also been forced to help out an\nover-worked fourth team defence. At fullback Steve Kaye has come on in leaps and\nbounds throughout the term, with Dennis\nCooke doing a brilliant job as the replacement for Paul Gohil who appears to have\ndisappeared after some excellent early\nseason performances. The only problem at\nthe moment in defence is the goalkeeper's jersey, which has been filled by eight different people throughout the term. The midfield of Damion Kelly, Adam Esberger, Mark\nClegg, and Graham Dewart has been one of\nthe strongest features of the Fifth s, with\nthe large amount of running and tackling it\ndoes. Up front Mark Fol ligue t,Ale d Phillips, Stu Dillon, and his brother Bob Dillon have\nproved an excellent strike force and if at\ntimes they may have failed to score as many\ngoals as expected this has been made up for\nfor in a willingness to continuously cover\nback and help the other members of the team,\nCommiserations to Dennis Cooke on\nfailing to score in the 7-3 win against\nLondon Hospital III. He sent an accurate\nshot towards the top corner, only to see it\nbrilliantly saved by a keeper who had moved\nout of the way of far easier efforts. By the\nway, if you get injured keep clear of London\nHospital one of their players went down\ninjured clutching his ankle only to be in for informed by a team-mate that it was cartilage trouble.\nIt is interesting to note that the seconds\nbest win last term of 8-0 was achieved\nwhen half their team was made up of Fifth team players.\nP.S. Please come back Paul Go hil. Be it Hall football team would\nlike to play any other hall that\nis interested. Please contact\nJohn Shuttleworth, Int. 2753\nor Beit Hall letter racks. "

Martin Watson, proposing the motion, told\nthe meeting that Prince Philip would be\nattending the annual dinner of the Arctic Club at Imperial College on Monday 22nd January. The meeting voted almost unanimously that R CSU should kidnap him for a ransom of half the Queen's annual income.\nIt was pointed out that the Duke might be\naccompanied by armed bodyguards, but\nthis objection was brushed aside. RCS Union members had earlier heard\nthat the Duke of Edinburgh had declined an\ninvitation to attend the RCS Annual Dinner\nlater in the year. Revenge at this refusal\nwas also a motive of the kidnap plan. HJ T Hustings\nThree candidates are standing for the\npost of RCS Honorary Junior Treasurer fol lowing the resignation of John Mottishead.\nThe candidates are Cathy Hyde proposed\nby Anthony Cox, Dennis Kelly proposed by\nDavid Barrie and Julian Rad owicz proposed\nby A. Brown. Cathy and Dennis were\npresent for the hustings at the RCS Union meeting.\nCathy has been Acting HJ T since John\nMottishead's accident and subsequent re sig nation and would like to carry on this job. Dennis told the meeting that he would be the\nbest man (sic) for the job if Cathy were not\nstanding.\nVoting takes place next Tuesday, 23rd January, in all RCS departments.\nCollection\nA brief meeting of the RCS Carnival Committee was held as part of the Union meet-ing, at which RCS Vice President Rachel Snee proposed that \u00a3800 be collected to buy\na phonic hearing aid for Jerome C and in, the\n11 year-old deaf brother of a student in Life Sciences 1. This hearing aid enables a child to hear his teacher at a distance of up to\nhalf a mile and therefore allows the child a much more normal life than is possible with\nan ordinary hearing aid. The collection, which has to be organised\nthrough a registered charity, was agreed by\nthe meeting.\nDennis Kelly and Cathy Hyde, two of the RCS HJT candidates\nSTOIC Returns\nThe ASTM S technicians dispute is now\nover and this means that STOIC can use the\ncollege TV Studio equipment again . This should result in programmes of a much hig her technical standard than recent ones.\nSTOIC is hoping to begin making special\nprogrammes to be shown on Tuesday lunchtimes this term and any club or society\ninterested in featuring in its own programme\nshould contact Bryan Steele or Dave Ghani\nvia the college TV Studios, as soon as\npossible. At present STOIC is investigating the\npossibility of extending its network to\ninclude L instead and Tizard Halls. STOIC also hopes to further extend its system to\nthe Northside Halls at a later date.\nAP Conference\nThe University of London Union Students'\nRepresentative Council, meeting last Thursday, decided to recommend to the next full\nmeeting of the S RC that a London Alternative Prospectus Conference be held under\nthe auspices of UL U. The decision was made in response to a paper prepared by Roger Stotesbury, ICU Academic Affairs Officer, who thought that\nother London colleges could benefit from\nIC's experience in producing an Alternative\nProspectus. It was agreed that Roger Stotesbury and\nSheyne Lu cock, the UL U Executive member\nresponsible, should organize the conference\ncon td. on back page\n\n"

I must confess, how-ever, to have enjoyed an unus al, provocative and sometimes amusing drama-cum-documentary.\nThe play is about a\" Halfway House\" in\n1965; then an unorthodox and unproven treatment of schizophrenics based on coexist a nie and \" Family\" therapy, \" Curing is something you do to bacon i\". It was there, following a mental breakdown that Mary Barnes spent five years of\nher life.\nToday, the real Mary Barnes is living in Devon, where she paints and also awaits\nthe publication of her second book L,( The calm and humdrum beginning of the\nplay is exploded by the shock waves of\nPatti Love's highly convincing performance\nas the hysteric all Mary.\nAlso notable is Simon Callow as the American psychotherapist! Eddie. He nurses\nMary as she crazes for rebirth and develop-es an obsession for painting.\nI got the impression that the therapists\nare indeed as deranged as the patients. As the play progresses one loses track of the\nthreshold'of sanity, so much so that when\nat last two \" normal\" characters appear 'i they not only seem out of place, but they I are the ones who look mad.\nThe absence of a proscenium curtain\nbrings the audience closer to the production.\nI felt almost as a child playing with a toy\ntheatre.\nChristopher i.io ii e jo two level set is stark but surprisingly effective as are lig h ting and noises off stage, courtesy of London\nUnderground.\nThe play is punctuated by total darkness,\nfour lettered words and Beatles' music. The\npaintings used are true originals. Farago's direction was detailed and realistically\nsuperb.\nDon't stay away from this moving production !\nJohn Shuttleworth\nBox Office 730 1745\nStudents from 50p Table Tennis Six matches this week, not seven as I said last ish,( four league and two cup).\nI.C.I V.I DON'T KNOW (A)(??) Would, Kumar (if he played) or anyone,\nplease tell me about this match sometime,\nplease ??\nI.C. II V. FULHAM IV (H)63 This was a good victory over a team\nlevel on pts with the seconds, and maintains I.C*'s challenge in div 5. A young lad\nfor Fulham must be mentioned -he looked\nlike Desmond Douglas and was twice as\ngood - (he won his three matches and spent\nthe time between winning, in giving advice\nto our team!).\nI.C. Ill V. FULHAM V(A)54 The match of the week -1 don't think!( no comments about that last phrase G alium!). We scraped a win - no thanks to a dismal performance by me - but Stean and\nReed pulled us through.\nI.C. Ill V. MARKS AND SPENCER( H)45 This cup match was given away, (as we\nhad only two players, and the pressure to\nwin5 games out of 6 was too much), which\nwas in complete contrast to the jam my luck\nof the fourths who played the same team,\ntwo days later, only to find that M&S were\nthis time a player short; (they scraped a63 win somehow). I think Lambert was distracted by his bread roll firing photon torpedoes (chips) at him during his tea (sorry,\nMark 0\u00ab The fourths also played a home cup\ntie against a team one division higher\nDept. of EMP III, the amazing Pete Rutherford again won all his 3 sets, including one\nagainst an opponent with an 88% average in div 5, and with Lambert's2 wins, they\ntriumphed 5-4!!\nSuperhewkif\nOrienteering\nClub\nThe clubs first event of 1979 was held\nlast Sunday over Crooksbury and Ruttenham\nCommons. The combination of open heathland in the East and forrest plantation to the\nWest proved very fast terrain for those who\nwere fit enough to stand the pace.\nWith the advent of a new year many club\nmembers have moved up to longer and more\ndifficult courses. Despite this, performances\nwere above average, indicating that it could\nprove a successful year for the club.\nPerhaps the best run of the day was Steve\nKirk' s4 th in M21A, less than 3 mins. behind\nthe current ranked British No. 1. In M19\nKen Warren was equal 4th with Gary Longhurst close behind, and Andy Quick fall, K. Pratt and M. Boyes also did well on their\ncourses.\nThe results of the S.E. Galloppen (a type\nof league) were also announced on Sunday,\nand congratulations are due to David Rosen\nfor winning M21A by a clear 21 points.\nClub meetings are held every Friday at\n12.40 in the Senior Common Room. All interested in Orienteering are most welcome to\nattend. Some details are also available on\nthe club notice board situated in the Union\nmain entrance hall. Ken Warren\nGross Country Club\nThe end of last term saw history in the l making as the cross country club staged\ntheir annual handicap in Richmond Park.\nHaving helped his team win two trophies in\nthe previous week, Maurice Wilson then\nachieved the remarkable feat of winning the\nhandicap for the third successive year, so j crowning what must be the greatest eight\ndays in his short, yet brilliant career.\nSetting off over two minutes behind the\nslowest runners and only just over a minute\nahead of the fastest, he still managed what\neveryone had imagined to be impossible. Disregarding the threat from Acford that he\nwould be passed within the first two miles,\nMaurice went scorching off at the start and\nsoon had the slower runners in his sights. Pausing only for a troublesome dog, and\nto direct those ahead of him onto the right\npath, he surged into the lead up the final\nhill and sprinted away at the finish to win by a clear 20 seconds, in a new personal\nbest time of 30.21. Gary Longhurst rani on\nwell to finish second, and Rich( ire en, running from the back, recorded the fastest time\nto finish third. Ian Morton was fourth, Geoff\nSherwood, fading badly at the end, was\nfifth, and Bryan Acford was a disappointing\nsixth and last for the second successive year. Credit to Ian Al vey for producing a close race, but the day must belong to Maurice Wilson, a truely magnificent athlete,\nsurely destined for greater things.\nA number of hardy souls ventured to Guildford on December 16th to compete in the\nannual 10 mile road race along the Hogsback.\nGenerally treated as the start of the Xmas\nfestivities, the I.C team were astounded,\nto say the least, by their success this year\nin finishing I7th behind many more experienced club teams.\nFirst for I.C. was Steve Kirk, who, despite having a bad race, completed the\nhilly ten miles in about 56 minutes to fi nish 55th, beating the first woman home in so\ndoing. Not so lucky were Rich Green and\nPaul Clarke. After being beckoned out of\nthe bushes by Paul with less than a mile\nto go, Rich out sprinted him on the downhill\nfinish. They were closely followed by Bryan\nAcford, who just failed to finish in the first\n100, but never the l sss recorded a creditable\ntime, well under an hour.\nThere were a number of other successes by I.C. athletes during the vacation. Several\nhad very good runs in their county cham-pion ships, and Ian Morton won his club's Xmas handicap and drinking competition.\nThe first fixture of this term was last\nSaturday at the Royal Military Acadamy,\nSandhurst. Traditionally an I.C. fixture, the\ninvitation was this year extended to U.L., who, in their usual tradition, supplied two\nrunners to complement our team. Despite\nBryan's attempts to dissuade even these from\ntra yelling with us again, we arrived in one\npiece. '\nHaving time to spare we explored some\nof the acreage and tried our hand at part of\nthe as su alt course, not anticipating that\nworse was to come in the race. A good quality field assembled at the start for a briefing of the course, by the Seargent Major, who\npointed out some of the obstacles on the\ncourse which had to be scaled. Unfortunately, he made no mention of the state of the\ncourse, which was more suitable to ice\nskates than running shoes.\nDespite falling through thin ice and\nother hazards everyone returned without any\nbroken bones. The first Imperial man back\nwas Steve Kirk in 11th place. Not far behind was a close bunch in 18th to 20th places consisting of Ian Morton, Rich Green,\nand Mike Kelly. And these, together with the\nU.L. runners, completed the team which finished a close third behind Thames Hare &\nHounds and Milocarnians, beating several\nothers. The other I.C. runners were Bryan\nAcford (29), Paul Clarke (33), Rich Harrington (38) and Ian Alvey (47) running his\nusual captain's race, out of 74 finishers.\nAfter the debriefing in the tearoom, Rich drove home to save the train fares.

We must remember,\nthough, that a sizeable number of our colleagues do have to pay\ntheir own fees - and this includes home students as well as over sea? students - and as such we should all act together as a Union to help\nthem with this problem.\nThe most sensible manoeuvre is to try to persuade the College\nnot to increase fee levels for next year for self-supporting students\nbut only for supported students. Retaining discriminatory levels,\nthis would only cost the College about \u00a356,000 which is a very\nsmall sum when compared with the several million collected via tuition fees. Ideally, of course, we could ask that there be no increases\nat all, and that overseas students be charged at the home rate, but\nthis would cost over \u00a3400,000 and is perhaps a little over-optimistic.\nThere are several concessions which the College could make, how-ever, between these two extremes.\nAt the Open Meeting of the External Affairs and Overseas Stu dents Committees on Tuesday (6.30 pm, Union Lower Refectory) we\ncan all discuss how the campaign should be run, and what form it\ncan take, so please come along if you have any ideas, or if you're\njust interested.\nA far wider question is the Government's attitude towards overseas\nstudents in general, and I'm at the moment preparing a paper on the\nsubject for UL US RC so if anyone has any constructive comments\non the subject, I'd be pleased to hear them.\nCompetition\nOne unfortunate aspect of being a card-carrying member of the\nLiberal Party (shock, horrors, gasp!) is that I get to hear all the\nJeremy Thorpe/Norman Scott Jokes. But, if you think you have one\n.which is really original (and most probably sick) then I'd be pleased if you didn't send it to me, and then I won't have to give you a prize of a towel and a tube of stuff, (toothpaste?). If you did send it\nin, however, and you did win, then you will get.the prize. Entries should be sent to the FELIX office not later than Monday 22nd!5.30 pm.\njS hey ne Lucock\nI External Affairs Officer\n\n"

It was obvious that this melody had been well rehearsed and was delivered in strong harmony with a good treble.\n\" God Save The Queen\" lacked something of the inspiring anthem\nthat it's meant to be. Maybe the bass was a bit off. The concert\nended to my displeasure, with the classic aria, \" American Pie\", and all twenty odd soloists singing at once.\nI would like to have heard the R.CS.( Royal Choral Singers ?)\nMessiah from Scrap or even a Delta Blues with Bottle Neck. The Quad lighting was poor and so I unfortunately missed the\nsquare dancing.\nEver tried a blackout! It seems to be a new fashion. Once\npopular in war time, it is only recently that it has been put to\ngood effect.\nOne example of note resulted in one of the most incoherent and\ndramatic evenings Dave Haddon has ever had.\nThe occasion was at a certain notorious \" Housewarming\" party\nlast Saturday.\nThe amazing thing is that he did not seem totally aware of what\nhe was doing.\n\" Yes, I'm fine\". He said, confused when he saw the ambulance\ndriver.\nThe climax was: Dave was put to bed by a young lady whose\nname I am not free to announce just yet. (i.e. He can't remember\nwho it was).\nHas Dr. F.H. Berkshire ever considered imaginary paper cups\nI wonder. It can almost be proven that 5 is a perfect number in the\nsystem of \"Mathematical Beasts\".
