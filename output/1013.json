I Museum and took part in Europe's first ever womens science night. They spent\nI the evening engaged in workshops extracting DNA from onions and investigating electromagnetism, as well as discovering one woman's experience\nof bringing meteorites back from Antarctica in a freezer. But why does the Museum feel\nthat science events aimed at women are needed? Perhaps the following experience\npoints towards the answer...\nIt was a quiet day in Launch Pad, the ^Science Museum's most popular gallery. I was standing at the School's Entrance with my clip board, waiting to welcome a school\ngroup who were due to arrive. Clusters of uniformed lads began to arrive, and eventually\nthe teacher appeared. \"Sorry we're late\", she said. \"The group's split into three and some\nhave gone to the V&A or the Natural History Museum.\" I briefed the group and they\nwent into the gallery. The teacher herself looked at a bit of a loose end so I asked her\nabout the school. Were the boys studying science? Well, she said, they were A level students and were studying various subjects. Was the group from a boy's school? \"No, but\nall the girls have gone to the Natural History Museum\", she said.\nIn this week's S files, find out why womens science night happened from the people\nwho were involved.\nfa Credits: Editors\nHilary \u00b0 Photographs9\nScience ITluseum/fl nt any nia hms on''.: \u2022.!'. by,\nRebecca Mile ham) reveal!

The tripod was\nbeing used by the STOIC team\nwho were trying to film and take\nphotographs of the UGM, which\nhad the largest attendance for\nmany years.\nPiers Williams, STOIC\nchair, said, \"nobody really knows\nwhat happened\", but he admitted\nthat Brian Crotaz, STOIC\nTechnical Manager, had said that\nhe might have knocked it over.\nHe blamed the 'absolute chaos' of\nthe over-crowded UGM for the\ntragic incident.\nThe accident caused the start\nof the meeting to be delayed.\nLucy Chothia, Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) President,\nannounced that there had been\n\"a bit of an accident at the back\",\nwith one of the many St. Mary's students retorting, \"Is there a doctor in the house?\" The\nuproarious laughter which\nfollowed suggested that few\npeople realised the extent of\nSam's injuries.\nSam was given first aid\ntreatment by Graham Innes,\nSherfield Security Guard, and\nwas then taken to St Mary's Hospital.\nMiss Scotcher told FELIX that she spent two and a half\nhours in casualty but was told\nthat she had suffered no serious\ndamage. She has, she said,\nremained at home following the\naccident and was \"taking it easy\".\nNo apology has been\nreceived by Miss Scotcher from\nSTOIC for the accident as\nFELIX went to press.\nThanks to St Mary's presence, last Friday's UGM probably was one of the\nmost exciting for years, writes John Sinner, but it wasn't the only mark they\nleft on Imperial. Sources in Wilson House, St Mary's hall of residence,\nspotted a poster last week featuring aT shaped diagram and the words:\n\"We've given IC an early Christmas present.

SHIRMAN\nFollowing drunken incidents in\nDa Vinci's bar Imperial College\nHockey Club (ICHC) face a fine\nof \u00a3115. The club is being asked\nto pay for the replacement of a number of panels, after tampons\nsoaked in beer were thrown at\nthe ceiling.\nIt is alleged that at the time,\nthe hockey club agreed to pay for\nthe ceiling panels, something\nwhich they dismiss as a single\nmember's comment. It is now\nproposed that the club repair the\nbrown marks, while the Union\nExecutive Committee has\ndeferred its final decision until\nnext Monday.\nThe ICHC feel victimised\nbecause being an easily\nidentifiable group they are being\nsingled out unfairly. \"We're\nquite happy to go up and scrub\nit, paint it, and so on, but we\ndon't feel that it needs to be\nreplaced\", said Stephanie\nCouchman, the women's team\ncaptain. Members of Imperial\nCollege Union Executive\nCommittee feel differently, with\nDan Look, ICU Vice President\n(Finance & Services), putting\nforward the case for replacing of\nthe tiles. He is understood to\nthink that only the club should\npay, as opposed to the money\ncoming from general funds,\nwhich would penal is e all\nstudents.\nWith the hockey club\nboycotting Da Vinci's last\nWednesday, and talk of other\nsports clubs joining them, the\nfinancial impact is also being\nraised. The hockey club point to\nthe fact that Wednesday is\nknown as the night when the\nsports clubs' members spend\nlarge amounts of money in the\nUnion. They claim that if this\nwas to cease the Union would\nlose considerable trade, with the\nmoney going instead to the\nSouthside bar.\nWhile the hockey club\nadmit responsibility, Rachel\nCurran, a member of the club's committee, says that if the \u00a3115\ncharge is imposed they would\nregard it as \"unfair treatment\".\nHowever they will have to wait\nuntil Monday to see if the club\nwill have to pay.\nVinod Fernandez, Royal\nSchool of Mines President and\nmember of the ICU Exec which\nrules on the matter, feels\ndifferently remarking \"Bars are\nfor drinking in and not for\nplaying with tampons.\"\nMM FELIX 2\n5\nII0II91 "

The British Gas Wildlife Photographer of the Year\ncompetition organised by BBC Wildlife Magazine and the Natural History Museum.\nThe Victorians were great\nCollectors. If something\nunknown fluttered, slithered or scuttled past, the sad,\ninevitable result was, BANG!...,\nthud, \"...oh, it's one of those\". The\nresulting specimen was often\nstuffed and put onto display.\nIn fact, most natural history museum\ncollections were pioneered this way.\nTestament to this, you will find in the main\nhall of the Natural History Museum a bronze\nbust of Captain Frederick Selons, hunter,\nexplorer and naturalist, his rifle cradled in his\narms. Or, take a walk down the mammal\ncorridor; see the proud buffalo, a large\ncircular patch stitched into its backside,\nwhere, I 'll bet, the bullet entered.\nTimes and tools have changed, and so\nhave collectors. Point, aim and trigger; they\nim mobil is e the buggers perpetually on\ncelluloid. And now, wildlife photography has\na huge impact on our attitudes towards the\nenvironment. So, while most of us value\ntropical rainforests and would pay to protect\nthem, none of us have been there. Our\ndedication is entirely due to the publication\nof images of this un visited world, especially\nthrough television and photography.\nWhile the most important television is\nundoubtedly made by David Attenborough,\nthe most important photographs are possibly\nthe annual Wildlife Photographer of the Year\ncompetition.\nThe Wildlife Photographer of the Year\ncompetition is in its 11th year. The winning\nphotographs are dramatically displayed as\nbacklit transparencies, in a darkened wing of\nthe Natural History Museum. Curiously, the\ninitial impression is of entering a church.\nColoured light streaming in from windows\n(the backlit photographs), pews projecting\nfrom the walls and the vaulting roof help\ncreate a feeling that makes most people talk in\nwhispers. This year's overall winner, 'Polar\nbear and Arctic fox', shows the two animals\nstanding in the middle of hundreds of miles\nof white wilderness. Closer inspection of the\nphotograph reveals the ice to be waves, frozen\nimmobile into spectacular ice sculptures.\nDavid Bellamy, presenting this year's awards,\nremarked that \"two of the saddest sights on\nEarth are to see Polar bears in zoos, however\nwell looked after, and Arctic foxes caged in\nfur farms. They belong in the wide open\nspaces of snow and ice - to shut them away in\ncaptivity is the cruellest thing we can do\".\nOften, without meaning to, the wildlife\nphotographer has a conservation message.\nThey show us this other planet that we will\nprobably never visit. Such pictures serve the\nsame purpose that the stuffed bear did for the\nVictorians. They remind us that other\ncreatures exist, and are worth preserving.\nAnyone failing to be impressed,\nawestruck or moved by the photographs\nshould remember that, at a conservative\nestimate, around 150 species are lost every\nyear. And, that our devastation of the natural\nworld coincidentally began in earnest at the\nsame time as our 'exploration'.\nThe Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition\nat the Natural History Museum runs until\nFebruary 1995. Entrance to the museum is \u00a32.50\nfor IC Staff/Students except after 4.30pm weekdays (5pm on Saturday), when it is free.\n25R0U94 FELIX HI "

Perhaps\nit's less well known that Carroll also\nindulged in photography using\nyoung girls, often naked, as his\nsubject matter .\nAlice's Adventures Under Ground, a new play running at the\nRoyal National Theatre, has been\nadapted by Christopher Hampton\n(of Dangerous Liaisons fame) from\nthe writings of Lewis Carroll. It\nattempts to explore this darker side\nof Carroll's relationship with\nchildren, in particular Alice Liddell,\nfor whom Alice's Adventures in\nWonderland was written. The result\nis a thought provoking and\nsomewhat disturbing play.\nThe production centres around\nfavourite scenes from Carroll's more famous works such as the\nMad Hatter's Tea party and the\nTweedledum-Tweedledee episode.\nThese are cleverly interwoven with\nsketches depicting real life dialogue\nbetween Carroll and Alice Liddell.\nThis creates a charming and, at\ntimes, delightfully confusing play\nthat never fails to stimulate and\namuse.\nThe acting is both versatile and\nengaging, coming from well\nestablished actors (Michael\nMoloney, John Carlisle, Gabrielle\nLloyd, Joseph Mydell and Sasba\nHanau as Alice). In addition the\nstage set is wonderfully lopsided,\nheightening the dreamy atmosphere created by Carroll's childlike\nimagination.\nOne leaves the performance\nfeeling thoroughly entertained and\nalthough the play insinuates that\nCarroll was sexually attracted to\nAlice, it ultimately allows you to\ndraw your own conclusions. The\nmystery surrounding Lewis Carroll's true feelings towards young girls is\nlikely to remain unsolved. Q static ^ destinations full ahead\nThe new Still Lifes exhibition in\nthe Consort Gallery brings a splash of colour to the Sherfield\nBuilding. Three contemporary\nartists are represented. The most\narresting pictures, by the American\npainter Judith Rothchild, are\nglowing pastels of brightly\ncoloured fabrics. The best, though,\nare the intricately detailed\nlithographs by German printmaker\nMalte Sartorius. Full of texture and\nshadows, his rustic pictures of\nbaskets, sieves and bottles seem\nto glow with bright sunlight.\nThe third artist, Lydia Corbett,\ncheats a bit by adding people and\nanimals to her watercolours of\nvases and flowers. She was\nPicasso's muse in the 50s, and\nalso on display is an article from\nShe magazine about her\nrelationship with him. This doesn't do her any favours, coyly skirting\naround the most interesting\nquestion ie viz Did She Sleep With\nHim? (Sorry, I mean Sl**pW* th\nH*m.) In style her figures veer\nbetween Cocteau and Ronald\nSearle, via Hokusai and of course\nPablo P himself. 0\n\"The biggest event of its kind this\nmonth\" IQ is not the night to miss.\nHopscotch Promotions, the minds\nbehind many a successful event in\nthe past, now present \"A fiery\nconcoction of hip-hop, swing,\njungle, jazz, funk 'n' boogie classics\nin two parts\".

    "content": "feature\nUNITED WEST AND ICU believes committee meetings are more import\nexplains why we aren't in the NUS\nWE FA\ni or tant than marches.\nSamanfha Nagaitis\nAnother year. Another bunch of eager\nfresher s join Imperial College and its\nStudents' Union. Everyone will be hoping to\nget different things out of their Union: some\nwill want to campaign about grant cuts, some\nwill want to battle against racism or sexism\nand some just want the cheap beer - pretty\nmuch the same as any other fresher s at any\nother university. There's just one difference:\nImperial College Union is not affiliated to the\nNational Union of Students (NUS). I ask the\nsimple question: why?\nThere are a mere thimbleful of\nuniversities not affiliated to the NUS: Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews and IC. We\nopted out of the NUS in 1976 for reasons that\naren't known but are assumed by some to be\nsocio-political - ICU disagreed with the\nNUS's policy on, for example, women's right\nto abortion, lesbian and gay rights and anti-racism campaigning. However, if this was the\ncase, it certainly isn't now. Today's barrier\nappears to be a financial one.\nIt costs an overwhelming \u00a340,000 to\nbecome affiliated to the NUS. The NUS\nclaim, however, that figures for other London\ncolleges and universities show\nthat this investment is\nprofitable. ICU disagree.\nThere are four main\nareas of NUS activity that ICU\ncould benefit from. First, the\nNUS buying groups. The NUS\ninvite breweries, for example,\nor publishers, to compete on\nprice. ICU simply snaps up the\ncompanies rejected by the\nNUS, and still gets reasonable\nprices. Apparently, we have\ngood relationships with some\nof these companies: ties that\nwould have to be broken if we\naffiliated. Second, the NUS\noffer training. Union officers\nneed to be trained in the\nnecessary skills in order to\noperate efficiently. For\nexample, entertainment officers\nare taught organisational skills\nso they can organise effective\nentertainments, and so on. But\nwe get sufficient training from\nICU and UL U, and other\nFELIX London colleges agree that NUS training isn't needed. Third, legal advice. NUS do give\ngood legal advice. But then, ICU could buy\nbetter legal aid with the \u00a340,000 saved by not\naffiliating. Finally, the NUS offers research.\nYou may, throughout your student life, need\nadvice on matters such as grants, loans,\ntaxation, housing and so on. Your Union\nshould be able to research either your\nproblem, or a general problem affecting a number of student. But again UL U can\nprovide all the research we need.\nSo, what are the benefits of affiliation\nwith the NUS? We would have extra\ndiscounts in clubs and shops. We would join a united body of students. OK, we are entitled\nto join any large demonstration the NUS\nholds to make up the numbers, but by\naffiliating we show the Government that all\nstudents are united. Our beliefs would have\nmore impact if all students in Britain\nbelonged to one union: \"United we stand,\ndivided we fall.\"\nBut this begs another question. ICU is\nnot political. This means that all the political\nbenefits of a single union are irrelevant as far\nIi hi -\u00bb\nas ICU are concerned.\nNot being political is rather a strong conviction. But Lucy\nChothia, IC Union President,\nbelieves it to be the best stance. She\nsaid \"it is more important for me to sit on the\nCollege Welfare Committee than to go on a march.\" In this way our hardships would fall\non the ear of the Rector, who would have\nmuch more pull on the government than\nthousands of rowdy, possibly violent, students\nmarching through London.\nDoes this apolitical stance mean that we\ncannot affiliate without having our views\nradically changed? Surely, if we affiliate, all\nNUS policies will be thrust down our throats\nand we will be expected to accept them\nwholeheartedly? Apparently not, according to\nSharon Hunter, Regional Officer of NUS\nLondon Area. Sharon maintains that the\n\"NUS is a federal organisation. Our policies\nare not forced; you are entitled to disagree.\"\nWhat would be the consequences of\naffiliation? ICU has considered holding a student referendum on this issue. If the\nconsensus was to affiliate, ICU would have to\nhave to find the money from\nsomewhere. It would probably\ncome from clubs and societies.\nICU spends more money on\nstudent activity than any other\nuniversity union in the UK. This is why the membership\nfees for our clubs and societies\nare so low. If ICU took some of\nthis money away, the students\nwill pay through increased\nmembership fees.\nMake up your own mind.\nIf we did affiliate, we would be\njoining a country ful of students\nfighting for our education and\nrights, at the expense of our\npersonal welfare and pockets. If\nwe don't, ICU will continue to\nlook after its own - we'll place\nour grievances into the hands of\nthe College Welfare Committee\nand our money back in our\npockets. It's up to us. I'm not\ntrying to tell you what to think;\nI'm telling you to think. B "

    "content": "Incoming\nA sweet discourse, short of coarse, from brilliant wit, to a simple...\nforthright gentlemen _ _\nEdited this week by\nDavid Cohen\nTragic Comic?\nDear Felix,\nYour guest editor, Marcus\nAlexander, must be too subtle an\niron is t for me. In greeting Richard\nPhillips' extraordinary piece of self\nabasing authority-worship (Letters,\n18 November) with a gushing \"too\ndarn right\", he must, I suppose,\nhave had his tongue in his cheek.\nThat is certainly suggested by his\nbizarre style of writing and his\npeculiar, Groeco-Roman, name\nwhich clearly he has invented.\nBut there is danger in satire.\nIgnorant people like me, whose\nsense of humour is less sophisticated than his, may be duped into\nthinking that he really believes the\nnonsense he writes. Dullards that\nwe are, we may suppose that he\nactually thinks that because Britain\nis not a police state, it follows that\nit could never become one. We\nmay suspect him of being\ngenuinely unable to see why\ncriminal ising peaceful demonstrations might run counter to\ndemocratic principles. Worst of all,\nwe may accept at face value his\nhilarious injunction to \"buy a suit\"\nif we want to change things.\nTrue comic writing is rare, and\nMarcus Alexander is a master of it.\nBut he should consider making his\nwit a little more obvious, or the less\nsharp amongst us may simply\nmistake him for a stupid, shallow\n-minded reactionary.\nPhil Ramsden\nMathematics\nMarcus Alexander has always struck\nme as a peculiar person. His\ndelicately woven words, to the less\nastute amongst us, may at times be\na bit too subtle. But I read his response thinking (hoping?) his tongue\nwas placed firmly in his cheek.\nCall me naive but up until a few\nweeks ago I would not have\nbelieved that a democratic society\nwould question the right to peaceful\nprotest and demonstration. The\nCriminal Justice Act does question\nthis fundamental principle. Moreover it challenges some of our basic\nhuman rights (and the way we\nshould live our lives). At such times\nprotest is all that remains.\nI suggest we consult our good\nFrater (as indeed I'm sure Marcus\nwould likewise advise) to seek a meaningful explanation to this\npredicament.\nDecadent\nSediment\n\"The Secretive Brown Logs\"\nTo the anonymous shits who wrote\nto FELIX concerning the advert\nfor the Wing Chun club. I read your\nletter while I was having a shit last\nweek and I can't get over how\nmuch you remind me of the big,\nfat, smelly turd I'd just done.\nIf you come and wipe my arse\nfor me next time I'm taking a shit, I might see fit to show you some\nevidence of our club's achieve-ment's. But being such smelly\nshit ers, you won't have the balls or\nbottle to show up. So every time we\ntake a shit, we'd think of you.\nSeye Ontiri\n(Instructor)\nWing Chun Kung Fu Club\nExquisite! I must say I couldn't have\ndropped it better myself. I read the\nletter too, although it failed to\nagitate my bowels quite so violently.\nYou may laugh, but I have\nalways been of the opinion that\nmartial arts were created to teach\nself-control, mentally and physically,\nnot social ladder climbing. As the\nWing Chun advert (over which all\nthis arose) said: \"We will endeavour\nto find you the road to spiritual\nenlightenment...\". A noble pledge,\none which doesn't seem to go hand\nin hand with anal toilet antics.\nTo all of you astounded by this\nflagrant ill-use of space, I say it is,\nafter all, your prerogative to do so.\nLetters maybe commented on by a guest editor, whose opinions are not necessarily\nthose of the editor, and cut\ndue to space restrictions.

    "content": "Clued Up\nFrater Fiam writes\nOnce more in transit sub urbe, your\nFrater's train was delayed incomprehensibly within the depths of a shaft, at which point a painted lady\nwhined, \"god, it's like a bad\ndream\". This pitiful woman was\nfortunate that I failed to vent my\nacidic reply. She should think\nherself lucky, for if the worst\nnightmare that her id could\nproduce is being delayed in a train\nthen her nights must be far more\nplacid than mine own. Her\ncomment did however provide an\nastute observation on the state of\nthe modern world, in that it's too\ndamn safe.\nFood is presented to one in\ndiet friendly packs, vehicles shuttle\none back and forth in air\nconditioned warmth, healthcare\nand policing is provided to prevent\none experiencing the slightest\nmoment of hardship and the\ngreatest damage one can expect\nfrom one's job is RSI. Even for that,\none can sue. Our race has striven\nfor this cushioning airbag for\nmillen i a, and it is now here; but it\nhas one overriding, all devouring\ndrawback.\nOne could say that Homo\nSapiens has become Homo\nImpotens. No worry, no hardship\nand nothing to do; yea, the world\nhas sunk into that most deadening\nof concepts, Banality. People are\nfree to plod through life without\nexercising a fraction of their\ncapabilities. They need not act,\nmove or think. All that's left is the\nsoap opera mentality of day to day\nobsessions, the min u tae of the\nsupermarket. For some time I detested this state of affairs, but\nrecently its one redeeming feature\nbecame apparent. The pastel\nshade banality has a backlash of\nproducing random, sporadic\noutbursts of senseless and horrific\nviolence.\nThis perfect ease of life is its\nown worst enemy. Artists rile\nagainst it, youth fights back. Look\nat the delicate lunacy of the\nElse y/ Peregrin i murders.\nInconceivable during wartime\nravages, but plausible, nay\nnecessary in this a cultural mind state. Look at Bulger, at the\n'Fairy Liquidator'. With nothing to\nworry about, these people invent\ntheir own nightmares and create a world worth inhabiting. The mind\nneeds more than just the minimum,\nit needs to be pushed to its own\nextremes. Hardship, destruction\nand pain are the easy routes out. If you wish to ponder this awhile, I shall give you some choice\nfragments of thought:\n\"My soul is lying half to hell. Nothing seems worth living for. I am not a boy. I am a machine that lives. No feelings.\" Richard Elsey, murderer\n\"When and where and why did hate - and a new strain of hate - come into\nthe consciousness of the young?\" Bernard Levin, columnist\n\"the raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees,\nnow the only thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease\" Trent\nReznor, poet. The Downward Spiral reached 2 in the US album charts.\nPOLITICAL SCIENCE\nI know it's a fairly post-modernist\nthing to do, but it's time to ask\nwhat this column is about. The\ntitle, Political Science, doesn't give\nthat much away: the Politics of\nScience (as opposed to the Science\nof Politics). But what are the Politics\nof Science? And why should I talk\nabout it here, at Imperial?\nLet this be clear from the\nstart: this is not an anti-science\npiece. If it were, then it would\nattract no audience here at\ndebates. And, very recently, Roger\nPenrose has made some very\nwoolly attempts to set up quantum\ntheory as the basis of consciousness. If we don't have\nsomething like Science, then\ndebates will be of this quality.\nClearly, this is not the way to go.\nSo, no, this is not an anti-Science\npiece.\nBut Science, like any other\n-ism or system, has its orthodoxy.\nThis column is an argument\nagainst it. My thesis still remains\nthat Imperial is producing mainly\n\"Imperial graduates cannot think\nbeyond their domain...\"\nImperial. Indeed, I don't think I could or would write an anti-science piece. I think it was Popper\nwho said that Science, like\nDemocracy, is a great level ler. It\nmay not be the best method we\ncan come up with, but it serves its\npurpose equitably and adequately.\nPhilosophers have tried to\ncriticise Science as a process.\nFeyerabend, for instance, sees\nScience as a phase in history, to be\nreplaced by another, more superior\none. But it feels wrong to see\nScience as only a phase in some\nKnowledge-Inquiry process. If we\ndidn't have rational, argumentative\nenquiry, what would replace it?\nImperial has already seen the \"\nI am right, you are wrong\"-type\n\"well-behaved engineers\". These\ngraduates are orthodox in every\nsense of the word. They do not,\ncan not, think beyond their\ndomain. They can apply formulae\nand remember facts, but they are\nnot radical and not flexible, and\nleave themselves and the world a worse place. Classical music and\neconomics too have their orthodox\nplayers, so I am not singling out\nScience.\nThis is not an anti-Science\npiece: this is a column against\northodoxy. I want to question your\nassumptions. More than that, I want you to question your\nassumptions. I want to create some\nme fa doubt in your process.\nSamin\nElimination by Catfish\nMy apologies to any of you puzzled by the incomplete, not to mention incorrect\nsolution given last week for issue 1011 's Elimination.

Saturday's evening film is The\nHudsucker Proxy, starting at 8pm. Set in the\nfifties, it stars Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason\nLeigh and Paul Newman. Our Tim has been\npromoted to the top of a successful company,\nbut it's all a plot by Paul Newman to devalue\nthe shares. Tim's naive hopeful invents the\nnext big thing, and The Future is Now!\nClear And Present Danger shows twice\nthis weekend, on Saturday at 5pm and\nSunday at 8pm.

Unfortunately we were unable to take\nall the people who turned up to collect so Rag\nwould like to apologise to all those who could\nnot go. Monday was the Mines Dirty Disco.\nAt this event people arrived at the door in\nvarious states of undress in order to get in by\npaying as little money as possible. It was\nquite revealing to see how far students will go\nto avoid paying out cash! Next was the\nGuild's Slave Auction. Did you buy anyone\nto tidy up your flat, do your coursework , or\nyour laundry? This event was yet another\nsuccess with over 20 willing(?) slaves being\nsold.\nWednesday was probably the highlight\nof the week as it was the annual RCS Beer\nFestival. Hundreds of people gathered in the\nJCR to sample the wide range of beers and\ncider on offer. This day also saw the launch of\nthe already infamous 1995 Rag Mag - have\nyou got your copy yet? For those who had\nrecovered from the Beer Festival, on\nThursday there was a showing of the ever\npopular Rocky Horror Picture Show.\nOn Friday afternoon a few students\njoined the security staff and walkers from\nLiverpool on a walk from Marble Arch to\nKensington to raise money for the Roy Castle\nWalk of Hope. This was before the Rag Bash\nin the evening. At this party you had the\nchoice of listening to the bands downstairs or\nvisiting the Cocktail Lounge. Here you could\nlisten to music from the Imperial College Jazz\nBand whilst being served a range of cocktails\nall at unbeatable prices.\nRag Week carried on through the week-end, first with the Sponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump on\nSaturday for those\nwho dared to bare all\nin public. This was\nfollowed by the more\nsensible(?) 5 legged\npub crawl around the\nlocal area. The final\nevent was the\nSponsored Bungee\nJump which was done\nby the more courageous of you out there.\nAll things consid-ered, the week was a storming success, so\nwell done to Ian, Tim\nand Jon for doing\nmost of the organ is ing.

    "content": "Editorial\nXmas Issue Warning\nNext week's FELIX will be the\nsame as usual. Hurrah! But the\nweek after will see a change, in\nthat there will be no issue at all.\nThis allows us to prepare a big\nChristmas issue for the last\nWednesday of term. That's two\nissues left, for those who are still\nsuffering Freshers' Week hang-overs. Doesn't time fly? Yeah,\nwell go see a priest...\nFairy Story\nOnce there was a vast Empire.\nThe sun would set as another\nrose (well, for the residents with\nall-night computers access) and\nthe populace lived their lives\noblivious to those governing\nthem. Even the parliament of the\nland was doubtful, saying: \"Oh\nwhy are we rulers afraid of an\ninvisible hand that never stirs?\nWe know best how to rule...\" So\nthe scribes wrote new laws, that\nwould leave the populace to live\nand the parliament to govern.\nNow, not all the realm had\nbeen tamed, and in the deepest\nwoods and the lands that pinned\nthe coastline to the sea, there\nlived those who abided by their\nown laws, contemptuous of the\ndistant rulers. Delegates were\nsent to the heart of the Empire,\nto petition the king. And the\nking said, this can be so and that\ncannot be so. The delegates left,\nfeeling they had achieved all they\ncould against so mighty a foe.\nThe day to ratify the new\nlaws came. The pamphleteers of\nPhallux spread the news but the\npopulace walked quiet. Only\nthose closest to the seat of\ngovernment spoke, and thus they\nwere agreed upon.\nIt came to pass that the\ndistant tribes heard this and said:\n\"Our own tribe outnumbers\nthose who spoke by two-hands to\none finger. We ought go, and\nspeak our mind as one. If that is\nhow the citizens of the Empire\nwill it, then that shall be so...\"\nThe day of the second, final,\nreading of the laws was upon the\nland. The pamphleteers of\nPhallux spread the news but the\npopulace walked quiet. Yet in the\ngreat Meeting Place, hordes from\nthe distant realm battled for\nspace. \"See us, and see our\nmight,\" quoth they. And the\ngovernment saw them. \"Until\nsuch day as the Empire touches\nus, we shall not be touched by the\npenny-pinchers of the Empire,\"\nthey decreed, and, given that the\npopulace was elsewhere, the law\nwas written. But Queen revealed\na new power behind the throne,\nand said that the laws were not\nhers to make. The audience were\nconfused. \"Then you must tell\ntrue lawmaker how it shall be!\"\nAnd the queen agreed.\nThus, the massed tribes left\nand were happy. The heads of the\nEmpire were happy too, for\nthough the numbers who they\nbrought were low, they knew\nthey would never face massive\ninterest in the laws again. (Such\npower had now been removed).\nAnd the chief pamphleteer of\nPhallux, who had laughed often\nat the the joyous site of the\nmassed gathering was almost\nhappy. He knew that this week's writing was assured. But his\nheart was heavy, for he also knew\nthat there would never be such\nmassive interest seen again...\nName Dropping\nReaders eager to know who\npenned the article 'Another\nPicture, Another Planet' on page\n11 may be stricken to find no\nname. This wasn't to protect the\ninnocent, and certainly not due\nto shyness on the author's part -rather a mistake at the sub-editing stage. The guilty kitten\nhas been sent to the crocodiles\nthat dwell in the basement of\nFELIX TOWERS( Gran), so\nthe good name of Natasha Loder\nshould be safe in future.\nTalk, talk, talk...\nWe hear about the great things\nImperial students go on to do,\nwithout always hearing what\nthose great things actually are.\nOur new series of interviews will\nhopefully overcome this in a non-college propaganda esque way.\nThe series will feature MP's, Captains of Industry, media\nfigures and Zoo Keepers, and it\nall starts on page 7.\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Helen Randall\nEditorial Team\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kate Cox\nLayout and Design P.

The\nthree other constituent college\nunions are now set to receive\nmoney through Imperial College\nUnion (ICU). The President of\nSt Mary's Union will still be\nresponsible to the Dean and the\nDirector of Finance at St\nMary's; in contrast, the other\nunions will have to answer to the\nPresident and Deputy President\n(Finance and Services) of ICU.\nAt the meeting, Claire Maloney,\nPresident of St Mary's Union,\nsaid that she was introducing the\namendment to protect the clubs\nand societies that St Mary's Union supports. She emphasised\nthat this would only continue\n\"for as long as St Mary's remains at Paddington\".\nIt is still possible that the\nconstitution will go ahead\nwithout the St Mary's amendment because it has not\nbeen passed at two UGM's. It is\nnow up to the governing body of\nIC to decide whether or not to\naccept it. The original\nconstitution has already passed\nthrough two UGM's. Lucy Chothia, ICU President, was pressed to back\nthe motion when St Mary's removed her from the chair to\ngive her voting rights. A second\nballot was held, which she\nsupported, saying that there was,\n\"a lot for them to lose\". St\nMary's mandated the ICU President to \"fight our corner\nbloody hard\" should the board of\ngovernors try to throw out the\namendment.\nWhile Vinod Fernandez,\nPresident of the Royal School of\nMines, abstained from the vote,\nCharlie Bell, President of the\nRoyal College of Science Union\nand Fiona Grandison, President\nof the City and Guilds College\nUnion both voted against the\namendment.\n(Continued on page 2)\nULUBan\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAM AND\nANDREW DORMAN-SMITH\nImperial College Rag have been\ninstructed not to sell their\nmagazine on University of\nLondon Union premises.\nUL U Sabbaticals have\nrefused the IC Rag's request for\npermission to distribute it.\nGemma Williams, UL U President, contacted Lucy\nChothia, Imperial College Union\nPresident, insisting that the\nrefusal was not a reflection on\nImperial College itself.\nDespite the pictures of\npierced genitalia, UL U were said\nto be most offended by the front\nRag Mag\ncover that depicts the Moors\nMurderers' Myra Hindley and\nIan Braidy collecting for a children's charity. Ms Williams\nsaid that she has received a series\nof complaints about the\nmagazine, and that she was\n'forced to act'.\nIf Rag decide to ignore\nULU's order they will remove\nface expulsion and a possible\nban, from ULU's premises, and\nprobable disciplinary action\nfrom ICU.

John Harrison will be giving an\nillustrated lecture about his ten years of\nun sponsored and frequently foolhardy river\nexpeditions in remote Amazonia.\nJohn Harrison has been on 8 expeditions\nto the Amazon since 1979, published the\nbook 'Up the Creek: an Amazon Adventure'\nin 1986 and was the subject of an episode of\nthe BBC TV 'Voyager' series entitled 'John\nHarrison: Explorer'. His expeditions are\nalways made with one companion, no backup\nradio, and to places where it is still possible to\npaddle for months and see no-one.\nJohn will be talking about the Jari River\nand a crossing of the wild and remote\nTumucumaque Hills on the border between\nBrazil and Surinam. 400 miles from the nearest habitation, carrying his canoe from one\nriver to the next, he experienced lots of hard-ship, malaria, pain, wildlife - a true ad ven ture.\nIC Exploration Society have two other\nlectures planned for the near future. On the\n15th of December at 6pm, Dave Edwards will\nbe giving a talk about White Water Wildlife.\nDave studied management at IC and is now\ngoing through his officer training at\nSandhurst. He has experience from expeditions in Cameroon and the Himalayas.\nDuring the summer of '93 Dave led three\nother students on the first ever canoe descent\nof a large section of the river Nyong in\nCameroon. They also made a photographic\nrecord of frog species, and recorded bird\nspecies and several deadly snakes and crocodiles within the bordering rain forest.\nOn the 19th of January at 6pm Dick\nWillis will be giving a talk on 'The Practical\nConsiderations of Adventure'. Dick Willis\nhas been caving for 22 years and is one of the\nworld's most experienced expedition cavers.\nHe has been caving in Papua New Guinea,\nFrance, Spain, Greece, Italy, Irian Jaya, Java,\nBorneo, Thailand, China and USSR. He was\nthe leader of the expedition to Mulu which\ndiscovered the Sarawak Chamber, the largest\nunderground chamber. He was elected fellow\nof the RGS in 1981 and was secretary of the\nBritish Cave Research Association for 5 years.\nHis lecture will show how modern caving expeditions contribute to a range of scientific and development projects through practical field work carried out in association\nwith local people. The lecture will be well-illustrated with Dick's own photos, and slides\ntaken by some of the world's best underground photographers.\nAdmission is \u00a31.50 to non members and free\nto members. Membership is \u00a33.00.\nwho: Jewish Soc\nWhat: Chanukah Festival\nKeys: Latkes, Dreidel, Candle\nComing up this week, for eight days from\nMonday night 28th November to Monday 5th December is the Jewish festival of Chanukah.\nThis festival is in commemoration of the\nrestoration of the Second Temple to the\nJewish people, after the Greek king\nAntiochus had tried to convert them to his\nway of life.\nIn order to fully restore the temple, a candelabra which burned eternally had to be\nrel it using pure olive oil. Only one jug of oil\nwas found and miraculously burned for eight\ndays until more oil was made.\nDuring the festival, an eight-branched\ncandelabra is lit, one additional candle being\nadded for each night. Presents are exchanged,\ndoughnuts and 'lat kes'( potato pancakes) are\neaten and the 'Dreidel' is played, where your\nchances of winning are slightly higher then\nthe National Lottery.\nAs usual for a Jewish festival, celebrations involve consuming vast amounts of\nfood, this time of a generally oily nature, due\nto the miracle of the oil. To celebrate\nChanukah, Imperial College Jewish Society\ninvite you to participate in a candle lighting\nceremony with them on Tuesday 29th November at 5.00pm in the JCR. There will\nalso be a chance to sample some doughnuts or\npotato pancakes, and play the dreidel game.\nOn the Wednesday night (30th November) there will be a big Chanukah\nparty at Hillel House in Euston at 8.30pm, where there will be more food and a casino.\nThat Friday night in Hillel House there will\nalso be a special 'Friday Night Fever' at\n7.00pm priced \u00a32.50. If you would like to go,\nplease call Hillel to book your place.\nFor more information about the Jewish\nSociety, see Sarah Waiman, Chem Eng 2 pigeon\nholes or email ic-j soc@ doc.ic.ac.uk or\ns. wai man@ ic.ac.uk.

When harried office worker\nKafka notes the absence of a colleague in the\nsprawling bureaucratic nightmare in which\nhe works he is drawn into a hidden world of\nconspiracies involving disappearing bodies\nand anarchist subterfuge. Behind it all is the\nforeboding Castle, whose insane Escher-like\ngeometries withhold a terrifying secret.\nEvocatively shot in black and white, this\nfilm was just not done justice when it was\nreleased last year in only two cinemas.\nDirector Steven Soderbergh (of Sex, Lies and\nVideotape fame) has crafted a beautiful\nhomage to German expressionism by melding\nevents in the life of a fictional Kafka with situations worthy of the stories of the real\nKafka. The pervading mood is one of opp res sion, broken by some startlingly tense chase\nsequences, the scariest of which sees Kafka\npursued through his locked up office build-f FELIX25 nOU94 "

    "content": "Standby\nQ personal performances\nTH G menu Nanni Moretti stars in, directs and\nwrote Dear Diary and with its very\npersonal topic every aspect of the\nfilm's production remains under his\nstrict control. With this in mind, it's not surprising to find out that\nMoretti is the closest thing we get\nto a European Woody Allen.\nThough unknown in the UK, he has\na cult following in Italy and the rest\nof Europe and Dear Diary has\nalready won him the prestigious\naward of the Best Director in the\nCannes Film Festival.\nThe film is about himself and\ncomprises of three parts; 'On my\nVespa', where Moretti admires the\nsights of Rome; 'Islands' where he\ntakes a trip to the Eolian islands\nwith a friend; and finally 'Doctors',\nwhich shows Moretti's dealings with\nItalian doctors.\nWhen it comes to the entire\nfilm little can be said, although the\ntopics touched upon are easy to\nrelate to. This is especially true in\nthe last chapter where the film\nbecomes slightly darker. Moretti\nhas an itch that never goes away\nand it keeps him up at night.\nFinally, after many deferred\nconsultations, he is diagnosed as\nhaving a tumour.\nDespite the prestigious award\nthis film has received, there was\nlittle to keep me interested. The\nmain problem was that an autobiographical account of Moretti's own\nlife has no appeal to me. That's not\nto say that this film bad. It's funny\nand it's confident in telling the\naudience about Moretti's hidden\nthoughts and ideas and the\nphotography is excellent. But a personal account of someone's life\ndoes not constitute as a good topic\nto make a film on.\nOnly see this film if you have a desire to see a European type\nWoody Allen film.\nIn A GoodMan in Africa,\nMorgan Leafy (Coiln Friels), a British\nmid-level diplomat stationed in an\nemerging African nation, has two\npassions in his life: women and\nalcohol. It just so happens that the\nAfrican nation owns large oil fields\nwhich the British want, and it is\nMorgan's job to get the an\nagreement between Britain and the\nnew President Adekunle (Louis\nGossett Jr.) However, Adekunle\nblackmails Morgan to bribe the\nonly good man in Africa, Dr. Alex\nMurray (Sean Connery), who is\nvetoing a development project of\nAdekunle's. Gradually, through his\nconversations with Murray, Morgan\nbegins to open his eyes to what is\ngoing on around him. His values\nfinally begin to change, and at the\nend of the film he promises Murray\nto become more like him so that\nthere will be at least one good man\nin Africa.\nThis is in no way an involving\nfilm and certainly not a master-piece. It merely seems to be a sequence of not particularly\namusing scenarios strung together\nby a semblance of a plot. The\nscenarios seem to be based on\neither sexual innuendo or the\ncontrast between African and\nBritish cultures.\nNone of the characters are\nmore than paper-weight, with the\nexception of Morgan. He, on the\nother hand, undergoes such a drastic and seemingly inexplicable\ncharacter metamorphosis that it\nmakes Norman Bates look normal.\nSean Connery, in a role which was\nwritten for him, does little more\nthan be Scottish and play a round\nof golf.\nIn short this is a light-weight,\nunam using movie which has an\nirritating air of smugness. Q AC ventures into the throbbing heart of Soho, past the siren\ncalls of 'made to measure meals', to Pasta Fino. It's a place\nwhere the spaghetti definitely doesn't grow on trees.\nIn an uninspiring week, Magpie rides around on the vespa\nroadster that is Dear Diary, while C.A. Berry endures the\ntravelling tartan offered by A Good Man in Africa.\nMore goatees this week as the most fabulous and most groovy\nRahul attacks the singles with a vigour he usually reserves for\nhis patients.\nJoseph Ban follows the white rabbit backwards in time in the\nRoyal National Theatre's new play Alice's Adventures\nUnderground.\nThe Consort Gallery (or the Sherfield ante-room to the rest of\nus) has a new exhibition entitled Still Lives. A past master at\nmusical statutes, Patrick Wood went along to see for himself.\nAccording to those in the know IQ and Lovehangover\nFashion Show are the places to be seen at. Fiona shuffles\nher nights and gives us the lowdown.\nTom Petty's44 and still just an old hick playing his guitar.\nTintin looks at his new album before rolling with the Indigo\nGirls live. Vik straps on wi h Helmet and James Thomson gets\nthe Celtic charms of the Tansads.\nPatrick Woods returns, this time in the role of classical critic\nto give his opinion of Hans Werner Henze's Requiem.\n^ seven hills from home\nIt's easy to walk past Pasta Fino.\nAt street level the hungry\npedestrian sees a delightful fresh\npasta shop but no sign of a restaurant. Only by entering the\nstore and descending the spiral\nstaircase do you find the more\nintimate half of this emporium.\nFrom the dozen soups and\nstarters on offer we chose the\nagli at a( raw vegetables with a garlic dip, \u00a32.40) and the pane\ntricolore (bread baked with olives,\nsun-dried tomatoes and salami,\n\u00a32.10). The agli at a was a whole-some, satisfying start, but failed to\nignite the plentiful vegetables with\nan eruption of garlic. Its blandness\nwas highlighted by the stunning\ngarlic bread. Freshly baked in\nindividual round loaves, the bread\nwas crisp and crunchy on the\noutside, soft and succulent in the\ncentre, and oozing with her by, golden, garlic butter.\nMain courses are dominated\nby a plentiful selection of pizza and\npasta (all dishes \u00a3 4 - \u00a3 7 ) .\nVegetarian dishes provide the\nmainstay of the menu, with meat\ntaking a quiet backseat.\nOne of the speciality fresh\npastas sold in the shop and served\nin the restaurant is g noc chi. This\npotato pasta is served with pesto\nand cream (g noc chi genova is e, \u00a35.95). To those who have not\ncome across pesto before, this dish\nprovides a good introduction to the\ntrendiest flavour of 1994. The\npungent combination of basil,\ngarlic and parmesan bound\ntogether by pine nuts and olive oil\ncan be overpowering, but\ncombined with cream the flavour is\ntoned down and the sauce\nbecomes far more accessible. With\nthe light and spongy g noc chi, this\noften rich and heavy dish was very\neasily digested.\nThe pasta finale (\u00a33) provided\nan original and fun end to the\nmeal. The construction of chocolate\nfudge sauce, ice cream and\nwhipped cream around a platform\nof fresh chocolate pasta was quirky\nbut tasty.\nWith cheap ish and above\naverage house wine (\u00a37.50 a bottle), this little restaurant is a warm and friendly escape from the\nexpensive tr at tori a that litter Soho.\nThe menu is simple, the food is\nfresh and the potions satisfying ly large. This is good Italian food at\nvery reasonable prices. 0\nPasta Fino, 27 Frith Street, Wl\n251)0(194 FELIX HQ "

    "content": "Standby\nwhich way does that old pony run?\nForty-four is middle aged. Period.\nTom Petty's there and to that\nextent I suppose that he's passed\nthrough whatever it was he got to\nbe. Yet it seems to be a commonly\nheld thought that as with many of\nthe old time heroes of the 80s he's hitting a vein of new found vitality in\nthe 90s. Personally I can't hear it.\nFor me Petty reached his high two\nalbums back with 'full moon fever'.\nSince then he's been workmanlike\nbut nothing more and so it is with\nhis new album, wildflowers.\nPetty's main failing has always\nbeen his lyrical waywardness and\nhere his shotgun is in blunderbuss\nmode. Check out; \"I 'll be king,\nwhen dogs get wings\" and \"her j uju beads are so nice, she kissed my\nthird cousin twice\" for nonsensical\nrhyming and you get the j is t of\nwhat's going on. This is not to say\nthat the songs which contain these\nlines are awful; far from it. 'Good to\nbe king' and 'Honeybee' rank\namongst the best tracks on offer. It's just that when you appear to be that\nlimited in songwriting craft, the\noverall battle gets lost as soon as\nthe listeners glance through the\nliner notes. Still his nonsense\napproach to words is one of the\nreasons that he remains one of the\ngenuine feelgood writers in the\namericana theatre of operations. To\nthat extent you don't need proper\nlyrics, all you need is some idea of\nemotion, tune and melody.\nHis schemes, as they always\nseem to, involve small town girls\nand boys, locked into the road,\nradio on, pants askew but without\nany real idea of where they're\ngoing. Which is rather like most of\nthe album's direction really.\nThe most focussed Petty gets is\nin the sleazy 'Honeybee' but there\nconsistency we find is held within\nlines like \"don't tell your momma,\ndon't tell your sister, don't tell your\nboyfriend\" to the accompaniment of\ngrinding riffs. I guess that there's some kind of satisfaction there but I wouldn't call it pure. (6)\nArticulate, intelligent yet softly-spoken. That's how Page Hamilton,\nlead singer and guitar slinger for\nHelmet, comes across in interviews.\nArticulate, intelligent yet brutal.\nThat's how he comes across on the\nnew mini-album, wilma's rainbow.\nThe title track itself still boasts\nthe trademarked, shredding guitar\nriffs but manages to weave a subtle\nand surprisingly melodic vocal over\nthe top while 'Sam's hell' is a bizarre, two-minute, distorted\ncountry pastiche that showcases\nsome of Hamilton's threatened\nexperimentation.\nSill\" But it's in the live arena that\nHelmet really shine and the closing\npair of 'Just another victim',\ncomplete with one of the most\nslashing guitar parts you're likely to\nhear, and signature tune 'In the\nmeantime', with its somehow\nsoothingly intense build-up, make\nthis stop-gap release strangely\nsatisfying. (7)\nA brief description of the style\nof the Tansads would normally put\nthem on my 'I wouldn't listen to this\ncrap even if threatened with death\nby Des O 'Connor' list. However,\ndespite their gaelic rock-pop-folk\norigins and heavy political\novertones, they are atypical of their\ngenre.\nThe political content of their\nnew album, flock, is high, covering\nthe usual fashionable topics such as\nthe environment and, surprisingly\nenough for a Scottish band, the\nstate of the Union. This kind of thing\nusually gets right up my nose, but\non most occasions the sentiment is\ntempered by realism, notably in 'I know i can (but i won't)'. The actual playing is always\ncompetent, though what stands out\nmost are the haunting vocals of\nJanet Anderton. Her slightly rasping\nstyle adds real atmosphere and the\nbetter songs are usually those with\nher voice. Arguably the best song is\n'Sunlight in the morning', an\napologetic love song which again\nfeatures Anderton, adding emotion\nsometimes lost in other songs on\nthe album.\nThere are no duds here, and a liberal spattering of cork ers raises\nthe overall standard from\nreasonable to actually quite good,\nmuch to my pleasant surprise. It will\nnever be regarded as a classic,\nexcept perhaps by die hard fans, but\nmakes good listening on those rainy\nThursday afternoons. (6)\nThere's something of the same\ngentle political forces at work in the\nmusic of the Indigo Girls. However\nthat they're Americans mean that\nit's politics of the self referential\nkind. That's not so much burning\ndown the barricades as smokin' out\nthe devil inside.\nLive, the Girls invoke a bit more\nurgency than when recorded but\nwhether that's a good thing rather\ndepends on your view concerning\nthe electrification of folk music.\nSome people still haven't forgiven\nBob Dylan for his post-'blood on the\ntracks' excursions and tonight it's when they plug in that the Indigo\nGirls are at their blandest. The less\ncommercial feel of their early work\nstill shines though, only now it's filtered by the necessity, or the\nwant, to play some stuff from their\nlast album, 'swamp ophelia'.\nOn stage with the girls is their\nlong term bassist, Sara Lee, a giant\nof a drummer and occasionally Gail\nAnn Dorsey. They're a tight rhythm\nsection, but basically unexciting.\nReally the Indigo Girls are all about\nthe two figures up front who play\ntheir own acoustic guitars, sing the\nsongs they wrote themselves and\nwrap up the audience in the tangle\nof word driven emotion and flowing\nharmony.\nYet out of the four times I 've\nseen them, this is the most\nunconvinced I 've been. Maybe it's just that my musical tastes are\nchanging as I'd hate to think that\nit's anything on their part.We invest\nsuch a lot in those we musically\nconnect with. To lose them would\nbe sign of someone's neglect. \u00a9\n^ songs from the dead\nHans Werner Henze's Requiem grew out of a piece written in memory\nof Michael Vyner, the late artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. An\nhour long, purely instrumental work, the Requiem is subtitled 'Nine\nsacred concertos for solo piano, trumpet concertante and chamber\norchestra'. A first recording has just been released by Sony Classical,\nwith the Ensemble Modern conducted by Ingo Metzmacher.\nHenze is an atheist, and has taken the imagery of the Catholic\nmass for the dead as the starting point for a humanist rather than a spiritual exploration of death and grief. Thus the Rex tre men dae( with its\ngiddy trumpet solo superbly played by Hakan Hardenberger) becomes a depiction of earthly might, inspired by images of the Gulf War and Nazi\nrallies. This evocation of the vertigo of power reaches a brutal climax\nwith the quotation of Hitler's favourite military march - a lurid touch of\nirony worthy of Berg.\nAltering the traditional order of the mass, Henze ends not on a note of supplication but with an affirmative, hymn-like Sanctus. There\nare also suggestions of optimism in the driving rhythms of the excellent\nTuba mi rum, here placed after the numb disintegration at the end of the\nAgnus Dei. Another high point comes with the grinding trombones and\nflailing percussion that close the Dies i rae track 2 from 6'20\".\nThis is certainly not easy listening; the idiom is often\nuncompromisingly atonal. But the per severan t listener will be rewarded\nby a masterpiece of beauty, drama and pathos. 0\nsee a/ so seven day guide\nFELIX "

The new system will at\nlast mean that students will not\nhave to pay for services and\nfacilities they do not use.\nAt the moment a set amount\nof money is paid to UL U by the\nHigher Education Funding\nCouncil of England (HEFCE) for\neach college. There will be a five\nyear transition, beginning next\nyear, which will end with 50% of\npresent funding being paid\ndirectly to UL U, with the\nindividual colleges controlling\nthe other half.\nCurrently, UL U is negotiating which services will be\nconsidered as essential, and\nwhich they will allow colleges to\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAM Hopes of free Friday nights at\nthe Union were dashed at the\nUnion General Meeting (UGM)\nlast Friday. A motion, calling for\nthe entrance charge to be\nscrapped, was rejected, and it will\nstill cost \u00a31 to get in. Helen\nTeasdale spoke against the\nmotion, saying that it would be\ndifficult to find the funds to\nsupport the disco and the bar\nextension without a change to\nthe cost of the clubs and\nsocieties.\nThe proposer, Chris Berry\ncame in for criticism for the\nambiguous wording of the\nmotion, which provided no\nindication of how it was to\nimplemented. There were also\nbuy. The results of these\nconsultations will be published\non \"Consumer's Day\", scheduled\nfor 25 January 1995, when\nindividual colleges will be able to\nconsider which services they\nrequire.\nLucy Chothia, ICU President, has indicated that she\nregards both Sports and Welfare\nas two services most likely to be\npaid for by the Union. She\ninsisted that extensive consultations will be required within\nIC before any final decision is\nreached. Suggesting that the\nUL U buildings and intercollegiate halls are rarely used by\nImperial students, she said that\nthese services might not be paid\nfor by ICU.\nWith the final equations\nbeing available around Easter,\nthe Union will then decide the\nspending plans for the next three\nyears.\ncomplaints that he spoke too\nmuch during the meeting; he\nalso stood for the temporary\naccommodation officer post but\nwas defeated by Joanne Cole.\nIn a last ditch attempt to get\nthe Sabbaticals to take their\nclothes off, the U GM enthusiastically accepted a motion requiring them to take\npart in the sponsored 'nude\nkamikaze parachute jump'. This\nwas supported almost un-a nimo us ly, except for those who\ncomplained they did not want to\nsee Union staff 'get their kit off\nfor rag', as they had been exposed\nto quite enough at this year's Rag\nslave auction. In the event, none\nof the sabbaticals turned up for\nthe naked race through\nKnightsbridge.\nBY OWAIN BENNALLACK\nOver thirty Imperial students\nwill tonight be appearing live on\nthe other side of the television\nscreen. The starstruck students,\nall members of Imperial College\nDance Club, will be swinging\ntheir hips during BBCl's Children In Need.

Brian Crotaz, a member of the ' A' team and\norganiser of the event commented: \"It's a brilliant opportunity for the IC dance club to\ngain some recognition for the\nwork its members do, and it can't be bad for the college either.\"\nof the Royal Anniversary Trust.\nSince 1977 the Centre has\nproduced over 800 graduates\nfrom its MSc course in\nEnvironmental Technology.\nThey are now employed in areas\nas diverse as government,\nmanufacturing and consultancy.\nGroups from the centre work in\nsuch places as the Amazon River,\ninvestigating the disastrous\nimpact of mining, and the\nFalkland Islands, with the\nArgentinians on the depletion of\nfishery stocks. One of ICCET's groups has even suggested that\nthe international demand for\nrhino horn and elephant ivory\ncould be filled with the farming\nof the two animals.\n\u00a3 5 0 0 Bursary for First Year Engineering Students\nTo meet an urgent need for people of the highest calibre in British Industry, the Department for\nEducation and the Engineering Council have introduced from September 1994 the TOP FLIGHT\nBursary Scheme which is aimed at attracting highly talented people to a career in engineering.\nAll students at Imperial College who appear to be eligible have been sent to application form for\na bursar y through the internal mail. To qualify for the bursar y students must:-1) be starting their course in October 1994 (the bursar y will also be available to students starting\nin October 1995 and October 1996).\n2) be in first year of an accredited engineering degree (all engineering courses at Imperial are\naccredited except Mechanical Engineering with a Year Abroad, Engineering for Petroleum\nStudies, Environmental and Earth Resources Engineering, Environmental and Earth Resources\nEngineering with a Year Abroad).\n3) have obtained grades AAB at A level (or equivalent grades in another qualification).\nThe application form is very simple to complete. Students should bring their complete form to the\nRegistry (Room 343 Sherfield) for checking and verification; they will be advised when their form\nwill be ready for collection. Students are personally responsible for collecting their verified form\nfrom Registry and ensuring that this reaches the Engineering Council before the Council's closing\ndate of the last day in December.\nRegistry understands that this scheme is intended for UK nationals and that overseas candidates\nare unlikely to qualify. The position of EU nationals has not yet been clarified by the Council.\nNo Free Fridays\nAnother IC Award\nHave you heard the voice? writes Andrew Dorman. The voice of\nProfessorJohn Archer, Deputy Rector of Imperial College is coming to your\nradio. Each day London Talkback (1152kHz) invites a studio guest to\ncomment on the morning's newspapers. John Archer has agreed \"in\nprinciple\" to appear, and FELIX can exclusively reveal that if you prick\nyour ears between 8 and 9am next Friday 2 December you might just hear\none of his two five minute slots.\nH5H0U9H FELIX HH\n\n"

These and many other\nissues are the prime concerns of a small (but noble) team of union\nhacks. Hence WELFARE WEEK '95 - a time for you to pour out your\npre-Christmas bank balance worries into the caring, sharing ears of\nUnion welfare.\nWELFARE WEEK AIMS (yours):\n1. Meet the welfare team... at lunch on Tuesday, i.e. free food.\n2. Get educated-at the various stalls dotted around Sherfield and the\nUnion.\n3. Remember that Thursday is World AIDS Day. Statistics show that\nif you don't know someone dying of AIDS yet you will within the\nnext few years. Maybe it's time to get prepared.

    "content": "BackChat\nFrom Undergrads to\nElephants\ndecided he liked animals instead of ships and ended up at Imperial.\nI begun to understand something of the\npassion and fer v our which has surrounded\nthe affairs of London Zoo over the last few\nyears as I wandered through the doors of the\nZoological Society of London. Staring down\nis the bust of the Society's founder, Stamford\nRaffles. He died in 1826 so there's a lot of\nhistory bound up in the Zoo. Indeed for all\nthe specific issues of balancing conservation\nconcerns and profitability necessities it could\nbe just that London Zoo is suffering from the\nmalaise which seems to have gripped most\nBritish institutions over the last twenty or so\nyears. What is clear, however is that Jo (short\nfor Jonathan) Gipps is the man credited with\nkeeping the Zoo open over the last two years\nas well as being the man who will have to\nwalk the tight-rope that will keep it open to\nthe public in the future.\nJo has had what could be described as a rather disjointed career path to arrive here.\nInitially he went into the Navy as an engineer\nbut as he says, \"I discovered that engineering\nwasn't for me. I didn't enjoy the inanimate\nnature of engineering and I'd always been\nquite keen on biology, although I'd never\ndone it properly. I mean I'd not even done\nbiology 'O' Level\". So after consultation with\nseveral universities he got out of the Navy and\ndid Biology 'A' Level in a year. It was about\nthe same time that Jo got married to the sister\nof one of his Navy colleagues.\nHe was accepted by Imperial to do a Zoology degree. It doesn't take too much\nthought to realise that he wasn't really a typical Imperial student. \"I was probably\nincredibly pompous as a result\" added Jo. \"I was five years older, I was married and I had\ndone something before so I was a bit different.\nAnd on a general point, it meant that I was\nutterly committed to do well. I'm not stupid\nbut, you know, I'm not brilliant and I worked\nhard and it was easy to work hard in that\nenvironment ... I was doing it as a sort of\nsecond career, so it was important to do well.\"\nFrom there Jo went on to do a Ph.d at\nRoyal Holloway College, as it was then, in\nsmall mammal ecology and behaviour. The\nlure of further research in voles and lemmings\nthen took him over to the British University\nof Vancouver in Canada for two years. The\nnext five or so years were spent doing various\nacademic things before the conveyor belt\nappeared to come to a stop.\nAs Jo says, \"I ran out of soft money. I mean I didn't secure a permanent post which\nwas what most people expect to do if they're\nstaying in academic life and doing research...\nbut I didn't and I found myself at the end of\nmy fellowship unemployed and I had to make\na decision what I wanted to do next. I wanted\nto go on being a biologist but if I couldn't do\nthat, what could I do that was useful, and\nwould look reasonable on the c.v. and pay the\nmortgage and be interesting and exciting to\ndo? So I actually went on a short system\nanalysis course\".\nSo, strangely, the ex-Navy engineer\nturned small mammal ecologist spent the next\ncouple of year working at Kingston\nPolytechnic in their computer centre. Still,\nbehind the scenes Jo was still keeping his\ncontacts in the animal world.\n\"I was on the council of a thing called\nthe Mammal Society, which is a kind of half\nscientific and half amateur thing and Peter\nJoule, who'd been my Ph.d supervisor, was\nthe chairman. The then curator of Mammals\nat London Zoo was a man called Brian\nBertram. He was also on the council and I went up one day ... I'd just seen Brian's job\nadvertised in the paper. Peter Joule said to me\n'well why don't you apply for Brian's job' and\nI said 'oh dear no'. I thought that looked a bit\nserious, and he said 'give it a go' as actually\nwhat he'd said to Brian ten years earlier was,\n'why don't you apply for the curator of\nmammals at London?' and Brian had said 'oh\nno'. So it was definitely a question of history\nrepeating itself.\"\nFrom there it only took six years and a particular nasty bout of internal fighting to\npropel Jo to his current position as the\nDirector of London Zoo. So, is a good career\nplanned or fallen into?\n\"I think that there are some people who\nhave a clear view of where they're going. I reckon if you ask most people at the end of\ntheir careers well how much was planned and\nhow much was chance, I reckon there'd be as\nmuch chance as planning\", says Jo. \"If I'd gone straight to university and done a degree\nin Zoology I don't know what would have\nhappened. I would have been younger, I probably wouldn't have got such a good\ndegree, I might not have got a Ph.d, but you\ncan't tell what might have happened and I certainly enjoyed my four years in the Navy.\nIt was good fun, going abroad and all that sort\nof stuff. Certainly one of the things that has\ncome out of that as far as I'm concerned is\nthat people who go to university straight from\nschool, I think miss out on something.\"\nAs for the future? Jo's got a long way to\nto go. His 10 year, \u00a321 million redevelopment\nplan is underway but only time will tell how\nthe Zoo, which opened in 1826 to show the\nwonders of the animal world to a disbelieving\npublic, will enter the twenty first century. As\nhe sits surrounded by the agenda for his next\ngoverning body meeting, budget statements,\nmarketing plans and mission statements, Jo\nsays, \"What I find myself doing now is very\nmanagement orientated and a little bit to do\nwith the animals. I'm not regretting that in\nany sense, I love it.\" Q FELIX "
