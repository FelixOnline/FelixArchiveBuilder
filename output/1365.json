However, a lone\nstudent was spotted striding purposefully towards the site, before\nbeing chastised by a security officer.\nDecontamination showers were set\nup, and a number of officers were\nkitted out with hazmat suits.\nFire hydrants around the Chem\nEng building were found to be inactive by the Brigade, who had to\nbring water from the side of the\nSherfield building. This was due to\nrecent works to install a Combined\nHeat and Power (CHP) unit nearby.\nA number of students approached\nthis reporter with concerns over the\nway the incident was handled, and\nFelix put these questions to Ceri\nDavis, Head of Security. No alarms\nsounded in the building; Mr Davis\nsays that this is because the evacuation needs to be controlled to direct\npeople away from the dangerous\narea. Exiting through the nearest\nexit could endanger students. The\nslow evacuation of the building was\nin response to the need to increase\nthe size of the cordon based on advice from officers on the scene.

    "content": "Casino Royale: 007 returns\nHas Daniel Craig got what it takes to maintain one of the world\u2019s favourite franchises?\nThe previous James Bond was the\nstriking Pierce Brosnan who dealt\nmore with cool machinery than any\nreal fighting tactics. Daniel Craig\nhas stepped up to the platform,\nchided to be the geek who would\nbring the downfall of the 007 series.\nBut the critics and naysayers have\nbeen proven wrong. Daniel Craig\nhas brought a new angle to James\nBond. He is tough, lethal, lacking in\netiquette but still a winner with the\nladies.\nCasino Royale heats up with a\nfreezing start in Prague. Accustomed to talk and slick language\nmanoeuvres, this James Bond is all\nabout cold-blooded action. Witness\nthe black-and-white fighting scenes\nand the cold gargle of water as a\nman takes his last breathe. Swift\nassassination skills gain him the\nstatus of a 00 agent. And his first\nmission is to track down the terror-ist, Mollaka in Madagascar.\nNo prizes for guessing, but things\ndid not go quite as planned for\nJames in Madagascar. Instead of\ncatching Mollaka, he changes tactics mid-strike and blows up the\nNambutu Embassy. The lady, Judi\nDench who resumes her role as M,\nis obviously pissed with his wild-child tactics. She becomes increasingly displeased when she finds out\nhe\u2019s been breaking every rule in the\n007 book.\nDaniel Craig as James Bond is a\nman on a mission and he has reason\nto suspect that he has just latched\non to the core personnel of terrorist activity, the Banker. James Bond\nfollows his instincts to the sizzling\nbeaches of the Bahamas. Ladies,\nthere is good news to be heard. This\ntime, climbing out of the waters, we\ndon\u2019t have Ursula Andress in her\ntrademark white bikini. We have in-stead, the very tanned and sinewy\nDaniel Craig. However, there is no\ncause for worry gentlemen. Across\nthe glittering jewel-like waters of\nBahamas, we have the beautiful\nCaterina Murino. And she is no less\nof a goddess on a white horse.\nCaterina Murino takes the role of\nSolange, the girlfriend of Dimitrios.\nDimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to terrorist cells. Secret\nService informs 007 that Le Chiffre plans to raise money in a high-stakes poker game at Le Casino\nRoyale. (Hence, the name.) And so\nit is up to James Bond to save the\nday by playing his hand against the\npoker talents of Le Chiffre.\nNo James Bond film is truly complete without the cool cars and\ngadgets. The internal microchip in\nhis arm and the classic silver Aston\nMartin should be suffice to satisfy\nyour technological addiction. To\nteach him to play poker, M16 dials up the service of Vesper Lynd\n(Eva Green). Finally, we have an\nintelligent, librarian-chic Bond girl\nwho can meet Bond\u2019s mental and\nphysical abilities tit for tat. Tension\nis high and sporadic bursts of flirtatious spats add light-hearted comedy to this well-packed action film.\nWhile she does not don leather outfits and smash fists with terrorists\naka Michelle Yeoh, she is a Bond\ngirl in her own right.\nUnlike many sequels to well-known series, you do not have to\nwatch Casino Royale just to achieve\na sense of completion. Casino Royale marks the beginning of a new\nJames Bond era. Daniel Craig, the sixth James Bond, stars in Casino Royale.

He reluctantly teams up\nwith the unpredictable scammer\nGus Dickinson, played by Simon\nPegg and his ex-squeeze Josie\nMcBroom (Alice Eve) in a seemingly snag free plan to get rich\nquick. Of course, absolutely nothing goes according to plan and to\nsay \u2018things spiral out of control\u2019\nwould be putting it rather mildly.\nSurprisingly, Big Nothing delivers\nfar more than your average scam-gone-wrong comedy. The script-writing duo, a combination of JBA\nand American, Billy Asher, have\nmanaged to produce a dark comedy that is all at once hilarious, absurd and tense enough to keep you\non the edge of your seat. It plays\nlike a deliciously twisted fairytale,\nreminiscent of the Coen brothers.\nIt\u2019s visually enthralling story telling lulls you into a false sense of\nsecurity whilst secretly setting you\nup for a twist after twist. Richard\nGreatrex (Shakespeare in Love,\nMrs Brown) adds a compelling\nsense of energy and style with his\noften quite beautiful and imaginative shots which works really well\nwith the director\u2019s dynamic vision.\nWhat really makes the film so fun\nis the quirky ensemble of A-listers\nand newcomers which comprise the\neclectic cast. I\u2019m a big fan of Pegg\u2019s\ncomedy genius, having watched\nSpaced one too many times and\nI have always had a soft spot for\nSchwimmer\u2019s character, Ross. Not\nan obvious pairing though, coming\nfrom almost opposite ends of the\ncomedy barrel. Curiously the two\nbrought out the best bits of each\nside without going over the top. If\nyou\u2019re not a fan of David Schwimmer, this might just change your\nmind. He gives a grounded, rather\nunderstated performance, which\nis a refreshing change, and is obviously enjoying the challenge of\nnot being Ross forever by exploring his darker side. Felix is happy\nto report that he has done it to\ngreat effect. He plays off brilliantly\nagainst Pegg, doing what he does\nbest, just with an American accent.\nAlice Eve brings the threesome\ntogether never failing to charm.\nThey\u2019re supported by the likes of\nNatascha McElhone, Mimi Rogers, who has possibly one of the\nmost bizarrely wonderful cameos,\nand the consitently fantastic Jon\nPolito who is so enjoyable to watch.\nA highly stylish and entertaining tale of karmic retribution. It\ncould easily have become ludicrous\nand dull, and there are a couple of\nmoments where it seems to lose\nmomentum, but thanks to some\ninspiring directing and great acting talent it leaves you, somewhat\nghoulishly, wanting just a little\nbit more, with a final wicked twist\nsure to fire up the imagination and\nlinger for longer than you\u2019d like.\nCamilla Weiss\nSchwimmer remained oblivious to the stream of urine trickling down his leg as Pegg relieved himself\n20 felix Friday 24 November 2006\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Emotions, TVs, and radios\nMore live reviews including the omni-present Feeder and TV on the Radio\nThe crowd at this TV on the Radio\nshow is quite unlike any I\u2019ve ever\nbeen to before. The people here\nvary greatly in age; from impres-sionably young indie kids, copy of\nNME wedged in their back pocket,\nto wise old veterans still reminiscing about the glorious days of old\nwhen music was interesting and\nexciting for them. It seems everyone can find something to love in\nthis band, and the diversity in age\nand race present at the packed-out\nKoko tonight is proof of that.\nThe band opens with the pacy\nDirtywhirl, which starts slowly\nwith gentle layers of guitars, before\nbeing brought to life by the energetic vocals of frontman Tunde Adebimpe. His sincere and heartfelt\nperformance punctuates the otherwise peaceful guitars and sleigh\nbells which provide the rhythm.\nInterestingly coiffured guitarist,\nKyp Malone, also joins in with some\nunbelievably high-pitched back-up\nvocals which perfectly complement\nthe lead.\nI initially imagined the gig would\nbe a much more sombre affair than\nit is, as many of their songs are\nslow and down-tempo, but the band\nthrow everything into their per-Matty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nO\nne thing that is\nreally pissing me\noff at the minute\nis the amount of\nlittle rat dogs there\nare hanging around. I was in the\nunion the other week and saw\nsomeone with what can only be\ndescribed as mutant spawn of\na drunk shag with a cotton ball\nfactory and a shivering amoeba.\nIt looked so pathetic, I wanted\nto step on it and put it out of its\nmisery.\nI know they\u2019re everywhere in\nthis leafy crevice of London has\nan obligatory mouse-puppy, but\ncome on, why would you put it\nthrough the misery of taking it\nfor a walk? They\u2019re so tiny and\ninbred they can barely stand up\nwithout wanting to chew their\nalready-removed private parts\noff, just to numb the pain of their\nexistence. If you insist on getting\na dog, get a proper one. Get a dog\nthat is proud to take a dump on\nthe street whilst the owner awaits\neagerly with a plastic bag. Don\u2019t\nget a dog that every time it needs\nto crap, it fears for its life.\nWhy am I going on about crappy\nlittle dogs anyway? What\u2019s it got\nto do with music I hear you shout\nwhilst perming your poodle\u2019s\narse-curls? Well, I compare\nFeeder to one of these dogs.\nFeeder insist on making more\nmusic when \u2013 I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m\nbeing disrespectful \u2013 even their\ndrummer killed himself to get out\nof this band.\nIf you listen to their past two al-bums, all you will hear is a whim-per. When the best thing you can\nsay about a band is that they are\n\u2018anthemic\u2019 and \u2018emotional\u2019, you\nknow you are scraping a barrel\nso eroded that you can see Grant\nNicholas crying under said barrel\nas the fallen splinters scratch his\neyes. The best thing they ever did\nwas shout the word lemon over\nand over again. I assumed it was\na satire on the objectification of\nlesbians in the music scene as\nshouty riot-grrrrrrrl singers.\nI could be proven wrong because I once drank cider from a\nlesbian and had my tongue cut\non her numerous piercings. This\nmay not be a true story. Anyway, I\nmay not like Feeder, but some of\nyou do and you\u2019re entitled to that\nopinion, so we\u2019ve got a review for\nyou. Also, Freddie Freeloader,\nwho are reviewed on the other\npage are playing in dB\u2019s on Saturday, go pop along if you want.\nColossal base lines; intense guitar\nriffs; voluminous rhythms; thundering lyrics. There is an emotional underlining to the three-piece\nthat make them stand out from\nthe crowd, which was all the more\nprominent during their performance at the Roundhouse, a gig in\naid of the charity War Child.\nInitially starting off as a pure indie\nband with rock at its heart, Feeder\nsuddenly took on a far more senti-mental, moving and often emotive\napproach to their music, culminating in Comfort In Sound, an album\nclearly influenced by the suicide of\ntheir original drummer, Jon Lee. In\nevery performance from that point\non, Feeder concentrated on making their sound more personal, and\nit could not have been more appropriate for this particular gig.\nCome Back Around, a fairly energetic piece, proved to be a suitable opener to get the crowd going,\nalthough with Feeder\u2019s reputation\namong the nation and the dedication of its fans, they simply needed\nto walk onto the stage for the audience to be at their beck and call.\nInterestingly enough, unlike most\nbands around today, Feeder does\nnot have one lead personality, such\nas Chris Martin of Coldplay or Gary\nLightbody of Snow Patrol. They\nfunction as one unit, with the vocals\nof Grant Nicholas, the pounding\nbass of Taka Hirose and drum-work\nof Mark Richardson all playing an\nequal role, musically and visually.\nThis was clearly evident in the undeniably impassioned performance\nof fan favourite, Feeling a Moment,\na soaring track with the lead guitar\nriffs and effortless vocals propelling\nthe audience into a plethora of excitable leaping and backing vocals.\nWhilst Grant hammered gracefully\naway at his guitar, he made way for\na very jumpy Taka \u2013 who both used\ntheir guitar bridges as extra drumsticks for Mark \u2013 all merging into\none quite energetic stage performance as well as a musical triumph.\nAnother particularly poignant\ntrack, Just The Way I\u2019m Feeling,\nsaw Grant wield his acoustic guitar to great effect, and the crowd\n\u2013 with great gusto \u2013 was as moved\nas the band members themselves,\njudging by the huge grins on their\nfaces; it must have been a wonderful sight to see hundreds of fans\nwaving their arms in unison to the\nepic chorus.\nThis is not to say that Feeder\nsolely based their setlist on emo-tional, moving tracks. Liberally\nsprinkled throughout the hour-and-a-half were the best in head-bang-ing, mosh-pitting, sky-reaching indie rock.\nOf course, Buck Rogers and Feeder go hand in hand, and the venue\npositively exploded into joy when\nthe opening riff could be heard; this\npiece of legendary indie culminated\nin most of the crowd jumping to at\nleast the height of the stage during\nwhat can only be described as the\nthree guitar-riff explosions at the\nend of each verse.\nLost and Found again generated\nsimilar energetic leaping, this time\nwith the bassist encouraging people to be as volatile as possible by\nmimicking their previous jumping\nefforts on stage. Just a Day \u2013 possibly the track that generated most\nof Feeder\u2019s fans \u2013 produced what\nwas by far and away the most spectacular display of jubilance I have\never witnessed at a gig. The track\nitself is a rapid, rhythm-heavy piece\nwith lyrics particularly relevant to\nstudents (\u201cWaking up at twelve in\nmy clothes again/feel my head explode from a night of gin/another\nnight out late\u201d), and I was amazed\nas complete strangers placed arms\nover soldiers to form one massive\ncascading wall of screaming fans.\nFrom start to finish, Feeder produced both an emotive and energetic sound unique in the overpopulated indie circuit. A surprise cover\nof REM\u2019s Everybody Hurts during the encore, sung with absolute\nhand-on-heart honesty by Grant,\nproved that no other band around\ntoday could be more suited to not\nonly producing this kind of music,\nbut to support such an admirable\ncause with their near-perfect art.\nRobin Andrews\nlive review\nFeeder\nRoundhouse\nTV On The Radio\nKoko\nformance and even speed up some\nsongs with pounding drums to liven\nthe mood. At some points the crowd\nreally joins in with the feel of the\nshow; flailing arms into the air and\nchanting the words to the anthemic\nLet the Devil In. The fans clearly\nfeel a real connection with the band\nin moments like these, and the\nband are obviously enjoying every\nminute too.\nAt other times, parts of the crowd\nseem very detached and uninter-ested, talking during songs and not\nbothering to applaud the band for\ntheir effort in-between. These \u2018scenesters\u2019 seem more bothered with\nbeing seen at the gig than actually\nenjoying it, and in doing so, really\nspoil the experience for others who\nare trying to appreciate the beauty\nof the music. The fact that Club\nNME started right after the band\nfinished probably had something to\ndo with the general attitude of some\nof the crowd, but the bar prices\nmade sure I didn\u2019t stick around long\nenough to see if they hung around.\nPredictably the band return for\nan encore where, unpredictably,\nthe drummer and guitarist swap\ninstruments and play out to the\neuphoric Staring at the Sun which\nis a fittingly intense conclusion to\na brilliantly performed show. The\nsound quality of the venue and the\nattitude of the crowd are the only\nletdowns of a gig that I just didn\u2019t\nwant to end. To remedy this problem I bought a T-shirt and listened\nto the album on the bus home, but I\nguess I\u2019ll just have to wait until they\nnext play here to really satisfy my\ncraving for more.\nToby Prudden\nlive review\nROBIN ANDREWS\nFeeder rocking out (in-between another sickly, emotive ballad) some emotions with lots of emotional riffs\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nfelix\nFriday 24 November 2006\nR\n\n"

    "content": "I, Gamer\nC\nhild labour \u2013 it\u2019s\nthe way to go. This\nweek\u2019s focus on fun\nleads us to ask ten\nyear-old Andrew\nCook what he thinks of Lego Star\nWars 2 \u2013 cheap, punctual, and he\neven threw in his own illustra-tions. As long as I keep below\nAmnesty International\u2019s radar,\nI\u2019m onto a winner.\nOf course, we were all like that\nonce. We did work when we were\ntold to, we played when we were\ntold to, we ate what was good for\nus. Most of us started as gamers\nwhen we were that age too \u2013 and\nwhen you\u2019re young, a good game\nis something totally different\nto what we now see as being a\ngreat experience.\nSo this week, Felix Games goes\noff in search of smiles and lollipops as we take a look at gaming\nthen and now.\nAs a generation of gamers,\nthe market largely targets us\nwhen they design new titles \u2013 but\nthrough doing that, it\u2019s easy to\nforget that once upon a time\nwe liked pretending to be rock\nstars using brooms as guitars, or\nspent hours and hours building elaborate fortresses out of\nplastic bricks.\nAndrew\u2019s review, and Matthew\u2019s article on it, shows that\nkids are onto what fun really is.\nThey don\u2019t necessarily want to\nbeat the crap out of legions of\nbad guys and cackle as the blood\nspills. Sometimes they just value\nwhat\u2019s fun \u2013 and our comment\nthis week from James Skuse\nclaims that we don\u2019t give them\nenough credit for doing this.\nBut fun is making a comeback \u2013 and not just through\nthe infmaous controller for the\nNintendo Wii, or the block-bash-ing mayhem of Lego Star Wars.\nPeripheral gaming in general\nhas gained momentum over\nthe past years, not only securing the Playstation 2\u2019s success\n\u2013 as Chris Hemmens explores\noverleaf \u2013 but also opening up\na whole new style of play, and\na whole new style of gamer, in\nthe way we interact with our\nconsoles.\nThe festive season is almost\nupon us, and next week we\u2019ll\nbe exploring the highs and\nlows of what\u2019s to come during\nDecember.\nA lot of it is the same old shoot-ing, slashing and scoring \u2013 many\ngood games, but essentially tired\nconcepts \u2013 so it\u2019s good to see that\nboth in the near future and ten\nyears down the line lies a fresh\nbreed of gaming, as well as an\nenthusiastic breed of gamer.\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSC4: A splintered game?\nJames Freedman takes a look at the darker side of gaming and sees the light\nSplinter Cell 4 might be good, clean, throat-slitting, terrorist-beating, fun \u2013 but it\u2019s not one for the kids\nL\nike so many dedicated\nfans of Sam Fisher, I\u2019ve\nbeen looking forward\nto Splinter Cell: Double\nAgent ever since Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory ended in an\norgy of silence and darkness last\nyear. Ubisoft\u2019s stealth franchise\nhas been previously extraordinarily successful over across all plat-forms, offering an intelligent alternative to the horde of first-person\nshooters flooding the market.\nThe story takes a slightly more\npersonal turn than before \u2013 following the accidental death of his\ndaughter, Sam Fisher accepts an\nextraordinarily dangerous mission\nto infiltrate a terrorist organisation\nknown as John Brown\u2019s Army. He\u2019s\nthrown into Ellsworth Penitentiary to earn their trust by helping\na known member escape. After a\nbrief introductory mission, the player takes Sam\u2019s role for his escape,\nand must gradually earn the JBA\u2019s\ntrust by helping them prepare a\nmajor attack on several cities. Curiously, JBA seem to have access to\nthe same technology as the National Security Agency, so any players\nwishing to see an alternative to the\nstandard headgear, or the SC20K,\nwill be disappointed.\nDouble Agent is powered by the\nUnreal Engine 2; whilst levels and\ncharacters are well detailed and the\ngame does look good, it is difficult to\nbelieve that this is the same Unreal\nengine that delivered the vast expanses and beautiful environments\nwe have been treated to in Unreal\nII and Unreal Tournament 2004. Individual levels are incredibly small,\nreminiscent of Deus Ex\u2019s downsizing for its port to Playstation 2.\nAnd not only are they small, but\nthere also aren\u2019t very many of\nthem. The Splinter Cell series has\nalways kept things short and sweet,\nand Double Agent is no exception.\nThere are 11 levels, not including\ntutorials, of which two time under\nten minutes, and four are set in the\nsame building. That aside, every\nsingle level is extremely well designed \u2013 the number of pipes, vents\netc. available to circumvent the enemy is astounding, and there is always a way to avoid conflict.\nHowever, there\u2019s a far more serious problem: Even at night, in a\nroom with all the lights turned off,\nthe game is still bright. The guards\nmay not be able to see Sam, but the\nplayer can still clearly see all the\ncontents of the room. In the entire\ngame, I barely used night-vision,\nnever touched the thermal vision\nor the \u2018wave\u2019 vision (which unlike\nprevious games, is never required\nfor an objective). The iconic three\ngreen eyes have been such a staple\nof the series since its foundation,\nand I was dismayed to find that they\nnow so surplus to requirements,\nthat in some missions Sam doesn\u2019t\neven bother to wear his headgear. A\nhigh price to pay for a new twist in\ngameplay.\nThe trust system, and the array\nof objectives (most of which are\noptional, and some of which are\nconflicting), allow several different\npaths through the game. There are\nmultiple endings, and these depend\non more than just the last fifteen\nminutes of the game. Whilst playing\nI genuinely got the feeling that my\nchoices were affecting the outcome\nof the conflict \u2013 and although I had\nno problem keeping my trust with\nboth organisations at a respectable\nlevel \u2013 some of my decisions had\nnotable permanent effects \u2013 without giving too much away.\nSo while Splinter Cell: Double\nAgent seems on the whole to be\nan improvement, even with these\nshortcomings, it has several far\nmore fundamental problems that\nmake the entire experience intensely frustrating. The ragdoll physics\nare appalling \u2013 an enemy shot in\na chair will often end up perched\nabove the chair, some become stuck\nin a wall on their way to the ground,\nand occasionally a corpse will just\nremain floating in the air. It is extremely difficult to place a corpse in\nthe sparse and small dark spots so\nnecessary for concealing them, and\non one occasion, when I had a pile\nof unconscious enemies ready to\ndump off the edge of an iceberg, all\nbut two of them disappeared.\nI found Splinter Cell: Double\nAgent to be a frustrating, disappointing but still thoroughly enjoyable game. It was only at the end,\nwhen I was treated to soundbites\ninstead of a cinematic, that I noticed\nthe absence of videos throughout\nthe game.\nThe brilliant faux news footage\nof previous stories has been replaced by faceless talking, and this\nis symbolic of laziness and apathy\nwith which the whole product was\nput together. The care lavished on\nSplinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow\nand Chaos Theory by Ubisoft Montreal seems incomprehensible to\nthe European continental development team responsible for Double\nAgent. Make no mistake, I had a\ngreat time playing this game. I feel\nas if I got my money\u2019s worth, and\nI will still look forward (although\nsomewhat apprehensively) to the\nnext episode of what may now be\na tired franchise. But I will always\npine for the astounding game that,\nwith a little more love an affection,\nit certainly could have been.\n17\nfelix\nFriday 24 November 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Whereas the tennis consisted\nsolely of motion detection, bowling\nrequired you to use the buttons to\nposition yourself pre-roll. Once positioned to take into account the\nnatural spin due to left or right-handedness, you were set to roll.\nMotioning your hand in a clean\nsweep from back to front was immediately familiar as well. After\nmy initial shot straight down the\nleft hand gutter, I was scoring well\neven managing the first strike of\nthe morning.\nI managed to sneak in a quick par\non Wii Sports golf later on in the\nday, which was instantly playable\neven with my limited experience of\nthe real thing. Boxing also received\nhigh praise from two fellow gamers who duked it out. Wii Sports\nwas so entertaining we could have\nhappily spent all morning compet-ing. Nintendo have packaged the\ntitle with the Wii itself and whilst\nit\u2019s questionable whether this was\na ploy created to set the console\u2019s\nhigher than expected price, I would\nhave recommended you buy Wii\nSports at launch regardless of this\nanyway.\nAs much as I wanted to continue\nbowling, I asked to sneak off downstairs to the burgundy lounge where\nZelda: The Twilight Princess was\non display. I jumped straight into\nsomebody else\u2019s saved games. Once\nagain, the combination of Wiimote\nand nunchaku felt as recognisable\nas Link\u2019s green garb. Visually how-ever, Zelda was very jaggy \u2013 with\nmountainsides and walls looking\nas smooth as bread knives. One\ngamer observed that the graphics\nwere washed out and I agreed to\nan extent. Nintendo have reverted\nback to a more mature Ocarina\nOf Time appearance but there has\nnever been a more beautiful Zelda\nto explore and conquer.\nHowever, I had still yet to test\nLink\u2019s archery skills \u2013 the biggest\nissue I wanted answering during\nthe day\u2019s play. A spider was climbing a rope ladder. Immediately I\nwhipped out a bow and arrow. My\nview was thrown to the dangling\ndungeon stalactites. After a period\nof hand waving adjustment, I began\nto find my aim and successfully shot\nthe ugly arachnids. Playing Zelda\nbrought a sense of relief. With prac-tice, I feel the game will be as playable any of the previous titles, but it\nremains to be seen whether it can\ntop the rest in the series.\nBefore leaving for the Radio 1 office and PS3 play test, I was lucky\nenough to play on Ubisoft\u2019s first\nperson shooter, Red Steel. Previews\nand video footage that I\u2019d seen\nwere incredibly disappointing with\ndull, blocky graphics and an erratic\naiming system. Since my favourite\ngenre is the FPS, I was interested\nin picking this up at launch. To my\nsurprise and also the other gamers\npresent, Red Steel was enjoyable.\nAdjusting to the highly sensitive\ncontrols took some time and whilst\nI didn\u2019t manage to perfect my aim\nduring the time I spent with the\ntitle, I believe this will come with\npractice again. The sword combat\nwas especially entertaining and\nwith a classic Japanese Yakuza\nplot, I am still coloured interested\nby Red Steel.\nQuick games on Need For Speed\nCarbon and Call Of Duty 3 were not\nextensive enough to give a detailed\nopinion, but I would suggest avoiding Carbon. The controls feel horribly shoehorned onto the console\nand there will likely be better-adapt-ed racers such as ExciteTruck in-stead. The Call Of Duty series has\nalways left me colder than a soldier\nfighting in the Battle of the Bulge,\nbut I\u2019d suggest it was a worthy alternative to Red Steel if that\u2019s not\nyour bag.\nHere\u2019s what boxing looks like in Wii Sports\nFrom left to right: Radio 1 technology reporter Iain Mackenzie and the other lucky lads Kay, David and Phil putting the PS3 through its paces in the 1Xtra meeting lounge\nAnd here\u2019s what \u2018boxers\u2019 look like playing Wii Sports. Watch out, you may \u2018accidently\u2019 whack your mates\n15\nfelix\nFriday 24 November 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The bad\nnews is that he hates music.\nScarecrow\nAs promised two weeks ago,\nthough delayed a week due to\na lack of consideration on the\npart of a sub-editor, and due to\npopular demand, this is the first\nin a hopefully regular series of\ncolumns that will hopefully allow more people to solve the Felix\ncrossword and, less importantly,\ncryptic crosswords in general.\nThe most common obstacle to\nsolving crosswords is not knowing\nthe types of clue commonly used,\nand finding them too complicated\nas a result \u2013 in actual fact, there\nare only a dozen or so frequently\nused types of clue (or parts there-of) that are needed to solve most\ncrosswords. Before going any\nfurther, it is important to recognise that a cryptic clue will almost\ninvariably mean something very\ndifferent on the surface to the answer it is driving you towards, and\nmost punctuation is thrown in to\nfurther obscure the true meaning.\nFor instance, \u201cBrutally slain with\ntalons (5)\u201d does not refer to any\nsort of violent act. Instead, it leads\nto the answer \u201cnails\u201d for reasons\nthat will be described below.\nClues almost invariably consist\nof two parts \u2013 a definition of the\nanswer and some form of word-play. Crucially, these can occur\nin either order, and the setter of\nthe crossword will do their best\nto make it difficult to tell which is\nthe definition \u2013 in the example\nabove, the definition could be\n\u201cbrutally\u201d, \u201ctalons\u201d or perhaps\n\u201cbrutally slain\u201d. In this instance,\nit is \u201ctalons\u201d, while \u201cbrutally\nslain\u201d indicates that it is an anagram of \u201cslain\u201d, since any word\nor phrase which imply disorder \u2013 along the lines of \u201cbrutally\u201d, \u201cconfused\u201d, \u201cdisfigured\u201d,\n\u201cmixed\u201d, \u201cdisperse\u201d, etc. \u2013 can\nbe used to indicate that an anagram is to be taken.\nAnagram-based clues are perhaps the most infamous, though\namongst the easiest to begin\nwith, but far more common are\nthose that contain a number of\nsmaller words pieced together\nto form the answer. For instance,\n\u201cI go around truncated low ice\nhouse (5)\u201d means the letters\n\u201cIgo\u201d around \u201clo\u201d. (Since \u201ctruncated low\u201d indicates that \u201clow\u201d\nis to be truncated \u2013 this almost\ninvariably means to do so by\none letter. Other words used to\nmean this can be \u201cendless\u201d, \u201cunfinished\u201d or \u201cheadless\u201d to mean\nthe first letter is to be removed.)\nThis gives the answer \u201cIgloo\u201d,\nthe ice house referred to in the\nclue. While this may sound far\ntoo complicated, this sort of clue\nbecomes easy with practice.\nCommon pieces of such clues\ninclude numbers, which will\ngenerally indicate their roman\nnumeral counterparts; \u201cpoint\u201d,\nwhich indicates n, s, e, w or any\nother points of the compass;\n\u201cking\u201d indicating r or k; \u201cway\u201d\nindicating st or rd; elements\nindicating their abbreviations\nfrom the periodic table; translations of simple words \u2013 le or la\nindicated by \u201cthe french\u201d, for\ninstance; \u201cthat is\u201d indicating ie;\n\u201cfor example\u201d indicating eg; and\nany other common abbreviations may be used.\nSolving cryptics\nScarecrow\n23\nfelix\nFriday 24 November 2006\nPUZZLES sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLast week\u2019s crossword\nThere was a massive mix-up in the\nFelix basement last week, as the\nsharp readers amongst you may\nhave noticed.

    "content": "buy books at the cover price, instead\nchoosing to buy them for a fraction of\nthe price on sites such as Amazon or\nto wait for a few years and pick up a\nsecond-hand copy from one of the less\ncut-throat bookshops, of which fewer\nand fewer remain. In fact, it is rare to\nfind a book older than I am whose price\ndoes not exceed its original RRP by a\nfew times.\nAs an avid reader, I find myself resorting to buying any even remotely\ninteresting books I find at remaindered\nbookshops, which leaves me with piles\nof books with intriguing titles but little\nelse to recommend them. The inevitable upshot of this is that my enthusiasm\nfor reading deteriorates, so I read less\noccurred during the NUS disaffiliation\nreferendum in the late 1970s with several volunteers expressing irreconcilable views on the subject. This resulted\nin the only example of an open battle\nbetween the factions and the only time\nin living memory that trench warfare\nhas occurred on Queens Lawn. Both\nsides suffered massive casualties and\nhave learned from their mistakes with\nboth vowing to continue their struggle\nunderground. Even to this day PICU\nmembers against the NUS are still\nwilling to lay down their lives, with 3 of\nthem currently on hunger strike since\nthe \u201cyes\u201d result was announced on Friday evening. This was too much for one\nmember who cried \u201cnot only was our\ndefeat announced in the bar, there were\nalso women drinking snakebite. This is\none insult too far and I have no other\nmethod of protest but to starve myself\nto death.\u201d\nPICU fractured further during the\nearly 1990\u2019s with the establishment of\nthe C&G Martyrs Brigade who battled\nagainst the RCSU faction for control of\nthe disputed Department of Computing\nterritories. Brothers who once fought\ntogether for the bar to return to all male\nstatus now wrangled with each other\nover the status of a dank, dark corner of\nthe Huxley building. The C&G Martyrs\ndemanded that Computing was completely under their control while RCSU\ninsisted on the right to defend the minority interests of JMC students who\nare in the no-mans land position, straddling both faculties. A bitter conflict\nwas fought but after a JMC-brokered\nceasefire they re-united to oppose the\nestablishment of ICSM. \u201cFirst drinks\nfor women, now votes for medics. We\u2019re\ngoing to hell in a handcart\u201d shrieked the\nnewly appointed leader Ben, a 4th year\nJMC student who asked both faculties\nto put their sectarian differences to one\nside and fight the medics. \u201cThe medics\nhave caused nothing but trouble at IC.\nThey still think that they are a separate\nentity from ICU and keep demanding\nmore and more freedom. If they won\u2019t\nlearn to love ICU, then they will have to\nfear ICU\u201d says Ben.\nNaturally, faced with such aggressive\nlanguage ICSM have responded in turn\nby forming the ICSM Freedom Fighters (ICSMFF). The ICSMFF have been\ndenounced as terrorists by PICU on\nseveral occasions. \u201cNot all medics are\nterrorists, but all terrorists are med-ics. When will ICSM get their house in\norder?\u201d demanded Ben.\u201d The newly reformed PICU will not compromise over\nthe existence of ICSMFF. This war cannot end until they have disbanded and\nadmitted themselves proud members\nof ICU.\u201d\nSo there we have it. We all thought\neveryone in this place was apathetic\nbut it turns out hundreds of people devote their existence to mounting guerrilla wars against fellow students fighting for what they believe is right. Felix\nhas tried to talk directly to PICU but we\nwere unable to contact them. We believe the entrance to their underground\nbunker is hidden somewhere in the SciFi library although at the time of going\nto press this is unconfirmed.\nWielding the\nmighty organ\nW\nhat the hell am I going to say here, now\nthat all the drama of the NUS campaign\nhas died down? I could rant on about the\nIslam article in last week\u2019s comment\nsection, or I could tell a story about\nsomeone I consider an idol.\nEdgbert Roscoe Murrow (Ed Murrow to his friends)\nwas a broadcaster who worked for the Columbia Broadcasting System, or CBS, in the 1950s. Murrow was an odd\ncharacter; on the one hand, he was a journalist of the\nhighest order, and on the other, he was an entertainer at\nthe head of the hugely popular \u201cPerson to Person\u201d shows,\na forerunner of celebrity chat show.\nMurrow pursued the truth, with little regard for the elaborate network of advertisers, television executives, and\nshareholders that controlled TV then and now. He is best\nknown, though still not well known enough, for his \u201cSee\nIt Now\u201d show, which tackled issues other broadcasters\nwere afraid to face in the cloistered atmosphere of 1950s\nAmerica. Of course, this was the era of McCarthyism, and\nof \u201creds under the bed\u201d. McCarthy had yoked the nation\nwith fear; fear that \u201ccard-carrying\u201d communists had infiltrated the government, the movie industry, and the me-dia. It seems laughable now, but the junior senator from\nWisconsin held almost as much power as the President,\ncalling people before the Un-American Activities Committee and accusing them of, basically, treason without giving\nthem the chance to answer the charges against them.\nEd Murrow was the first to stand against McCarthy,\nwhen the media mainly ignored the subject, or toed the\nline. His show of March 9, 1954, took McCarthy\u2019s words\nand speeches and questioned how valid the Senator\u2019s\ntactics were, and how he contradicted himself. This was\nan extraordinarily brave thing to do, knowing that anyone\nwho had stood against McCarthy before faced accusations of being a communist,. He knew full well what he\nwas doing; using his medium to expose the hypocrisy and\nuntruths perpertrated in the people\u2019s name by attacking\na single man.\nMcCarthy was offered the chance to reply, and used it,\npredictably, to accuse Murrow of communist sympathies\nand membership. Murrow\u2019s reply was succint and to the\npoint, clearly refuting each of McCarthy\u2019s points. In the\nend, these broadcasts were enough to bring down the gi-ant, and McCarthy was censured by the Senate.\nWhat was Murrow\u2019s reward as a tireless champion of\ntruth, for holding public officials to be held to account?\nHe was shuffled to a Sunday afternoon graveyard slot,\nand quietly forgotten. Murrow was, to my mind, the last\nman to be able to hold the title \u201cjournalist\u201d in its truest\nsense. I\u2019ll use his glorious sign-off here, though it makes\nno sense, and I make no pretence of being Murrow\u2019s peer:\ngood night, and good luck.\nExtremism on campus?\nI\nn a shock expose, Felix has\nlearned of a dark side to ICU.\nSome of you may previously have\nseen the Union as a benign organisation that run your bars\nand look after your clubs. All is not as it\nseems my friends. Undercover journalists have spent the last 3 years infiltrating a part of ICU that few know about\nand even fewer will dare speak of. Operating out of their secret headquarters\nlocated deep underneath Beit Quad are\nPICU, the Paramilitary Wing of Imperial College Union and the most feared\norganisation in South Kensington.\nPICU was originally formed by a\ngroup of students back in the 1970s who\nobjected to women being allowed in the\nUnion Bar, a move they described as\n\u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d. Their\nfaith in the democratic system was decimated and members were compelled to\ntake matters into their own hands. They\nresolved to continue their struggle until their uncompromising demand that\nour bar was again a bastion of misogyny\nwas met. Their guerrilla campaign has\ncaused over 300 injuries, mostly in the\nform of leaving tripping hazards for the\nlady drinkers they so detest. As the saying says, violence begets violence and\nPICU have suffered themselves due\nto revenge attacks from irate lesbians\nwho naturally are staunchly opposed to\nthe aims and values of PICU.\nAfter their formation it looked like\nthey might just succeed in their goal\nof returning the bar to male jurisdic-tion. An early victory was won when\nthey organised a farting competition\nwhich turned away many of the new\nwomen customers. Their movement\nsoon fractured and as a result of their\ninfighting over the past 30 years they\nare not looking like succeeding anytime\nsoon. The first spilt in their movement\nThe Flaming Rat tells of the dark forces at work deep in the Beit Quad\n\u201cFirst drinks for\nwomen, now votes\nfor medics. We\u2019re\ngoing to hell in a\nhandcart\u201d\nI\nwas browsing through the books\nin a charity shop on Gloucester\nRoad the o ther day and marvelling at how unaffordable most of\nthem were. In fact, the only book\nthat seemed to be at a reasonable price\nwas a copy of Ulysses for an astonishing\nfifty pence. It was only later that I discovered this suspiciously low price to be\ndown to the book being in Norwegian,\nrendering it almost as incomprehensible as an untranslated edition would\nbe.\nIt has come to something when even\nsecond-hand books are unaffordable\nin anything other than an entirely useless form. Since I started buying books\naround a decade and a half ago, the average price of a novel has roughly tripled and continues to increase. It has\nreached the point where I will no longer\nYou do not get what you pay for\nand less as time goes by. While this does\nadmittedly give more free time in which\nto solve crosswords, it highlights a worrying consequence beyond being slightly more out of pocket after a purchase\n- that excessive increases in price deter\neven the most ardent of readers.\nGiven the proliferation of schemes\ndesigned to encourage literacy and increased readership, it seems bizarre,\nnot to mention irresponsible, that book\nprices should be so high, which can\nonly serve to alienate those on lower\nincomes, toward whom much of the literacy initiatives are inevitably aimed.\nSince opera is able to receive government funding and subsidies on the\nground that it qualifies as art, it would\nhardly be unreasonable to deny such\nfunding in support of a more accessible,\nenduring and, arguably, worthy form of\nart, in the shape of literature. Less rea-sonably, but still wholly justifiable would\nbe removing any such funding from opera and instead channel it all into books\n- to subsidise publishers in order to lower their prices or even to provide grants\nto struggling authors torn between neglecting their art or failing to make a\nminimum wage, amongst other things.\nIncidentally, if any Norwegian-speakers would like a copy of Joyce\u2019s magnum opus, don\u2019t hesitate to email me\nand I can provide you with a good condition copy for free.

    "content": "After thirty years in the wilderness, the students of\nImperial College London have voted to rejoin the\nNational Union of Students.\nAlthough the perceived wisdom was that Imperial\nstudents would never vote to join the NUS, I was\ncon\ufb01dent that a sizeable cohort of Imperial students\nbelieved that the bene\ufb01ts of a\ufb03liation outweighed\nthe bene\ufb01ts of isolation. I think that the message\nour members are sending is that they\u02bcre not 100%\nsure if the NUS is right for us, but seeing as we\u02bcre\nleaving the University of London Union, they\u02bcre\nwilling to give it a go. I also believe that the majority\nof our students are open-minded about what NUS\ncan do for us but they expect to see results soon.\nWhilst I am delighted at this result and, more\nimportantly, the record breaking turnout we\nregistered last week, I must acknowledge that\na signi\ufb01cant number of our students oppose\na\ufb03liation to the NUS and these students will be\nunderstandably disappointed. To those who voted\n\u201cno\u201d, I urge you not to panic or feel too despondent;\nthe Union isn\u02bct going to burn down tomorrow and\nour clubs will still be as well funded next year as\nthey are now. Now let\u02bcs move forward together and\ntry to make the NUS work for all of our students.\nWhen will we start to see benefits of NUS\nmembership?\nSome of the bene\ufb01ts of NUS a\ufb03liation will be\nrealisable very soon \u2013 support services for our\nsta\ufb00 and senior o\ufb03cers are now available and our\nrepresentatives will soon be invited to contribute\nto regional conferences, policy forums and\nseminars. As we have simply swapped one federal\norganisation (ULU) for another (NUS), problems\nrelating to reciprocal agreements with other\nStudents\u02bc Unions and additional University of\nLondon Union withdrawal matters have now been\ninstantly resolved without extra cost or fuss.\nThe bene\ufb01ts of the NUS discount card will take a\nlittle longer to kick in. As our membership will not\nbe rati\ufb01ed until February 13th 2007, our Union\nwill not be allowed to sell NUS Extra Cards until\nValentines Day.\nIn terms of participating in the democratic processes\nof the NUS, you can expect to see developments here\nsoon. We will be running cross campus elections for\ndelegates to next year\u02bcs national conference in the\nNew Year, so if you\u02bcre interested in standing then\nlook out for further publicity this January.\nThe next step\nNow that we have chosen to join the NUS, I believe\nthat we need to be proactive within it. Our members\ndidn\u02bct vote us in to sit on the sidelines - they expect\nus to work with those within the NUS who support\nreform.\nDuring the referendum campaign I spoke to many\nstudents who told me that they would like the Union\nto push for the expansion of electronic voting, the\nestablishment of a science and engineering network,\nand stronger representation for international\nstudents within the NUS. These are great ideas that\nI believe we should pursue. However, we need time\nto prepare these proposals, seek allies and build\nsupport for the reforms we want to implement.\nThis is why I think calls to hold another referendum\nin twelve months time are misplaced. Our students\nhave told our Union to give the NUS half a chance\nto prove itself. How can we tell out members that\nwe have tried to work with the NUS and reform it\nbefore we have even had the opportunity to draft a\nmotion for consideration by national conference?\nSo let\u02bcs give the NUS a chance. In around 18 months\ntime we can reassess the situation, but for now\nI suggest that we go with the will of the majority\nof students who voted in the record breaking\nreferendum last week, and support our National\nUnion.\nunionpage\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8060\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nImperial says \u201cyes\u201d to NUS\nSo what happens now?\nWell boys and girls,\nHope you\u02bcve had an eventful term and as it comes\nto a close I thought I would advertise the GSA\nChristmas Ball on Monday the 11th of December.\nPlease buy tickets online at imperialcollegeunion.org.\nThis event promises to be a lavish a\ufb00air with 3\ncourse meals, complimentary drinks, live band,\nhookah, luges and an \u201cinvisible\u201d guest-speaker!\nTickets are \u00a325 all inclusive (vegetarian options\navailable) and will be on sale for the next 2 weeks.\nIf you have any problems, don\u02bct hesitate to email\nme at dpgs@imperial.ac.uk\nGSA Update\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nShama Rahman\nDeputy President\n(Graduate Students)\ndpgs@imperial.ac.uk\nThe \u201c3 Colleges Night\u201d was\nvery successful with more\nflamboyance than a GSA\nnight has seen for a while!\nAll agreed that this should\nbecome a regular event\nand we\u02bcre even looking for\na GSA-RCA representative,\nso if you\u02bcre interested\nplease do contact me!\n\n"

    "content": "Lack of backs causes IC 3rds a lot of pain\nAfter last week\u2019s hard victory, the\nIC 3rds arrived at Fortress Harlington, fired up for another battle.\nIC\u2019s kicker Antoine got the game\ngoing with a good boot into the Sussex half, where IC managed to keep\nthe ball in Sussex territory for the\nfirst 20 minutes of the game. But,\nafter this almost promising start,\nthe IC\u2019s play started to go down\nhill. Sussex shipped the ball out to\na strong runner in their back line\nwho, after a couple of missed tack-les, managed to touch the ball down\nfor his team. Following this, things\nbecame pretty dark; the home\nteam making more mistakes than\na dyslexic trying to copy out the\ndictionary.\nIC seemed to be giving away\npointless penalties every minute, to\nthe extent that captain Ben Thompson a.k.a. Pork Chop Loin (PCL)\nreceived a mini bollocking from the\nreferee for it. Despite this, IC managed only to concede one more try\nbefore half time, which the Sussex\nkicker failed to convert despite it\nbeing taken from a position where\neven the average prop forward\ncould have made it.\nThe team knew there was an almighty half-time bollocking on the\nGiant windsurfers flatten ancient Egyptian landmarks. Or maybe the landmarks are just far away\nWindsurfers sail away with victory\nOliver Bevis\n26 felix Friday 24 November 2006\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ncards; Coach Dave did not fail to de-liver. Apparently it was like watching fifteen \u201craving homosexuals\u201d,\nfinishing up saying the 3rds needed\nto \u201cfuck off back out there and grow\na pair.\u201d\nThe words of wisdom seemed to\nwork; after an almighty charge from\nImperial and some very sexy ruck-ing, captain PCL dived over the line\nfor our first try, which was cleanly\nconverted. This lifted spirits and\nheads were held very high as IC returned to their half. Unfortunately\nSussex got a very lucky bounce\nfrom the kick and managed to touch\nit down under the posts within two\nminutes of the restart.\nThe game slowed down a notch\namd IC began to dominate up front,\nthe wheeling of the scrum that had\nhappened last game (mainly thanks\nto monster prop \u2018Satcho Relaxo\u2019)\nand during the first half had turned\ninto a full on drive over the ball,\nwhich produced many turnovers.\nIC\u2019s domination was confirmed following a line out mid-way through\nthe half. A clean take from Nicolas\njumping at four then, as directed by\nPenfold, the forward bound round\nand drove the maul just under half\nway up the pitch. Upon reaching\nthe line the ball went through Penfold to our flamboyant Frenchy Antoine who dived in low for a try in\nthe corner. Unfortunately IC failed\nto convert.\nThe remainder of the match was\nvery close fought, both subsequent\nSussex tries were runs by the\nbacks, around the wings; where\nthey managed to break tackles and\nget through.\nSoon after the second of these, IC\nwere rewarded with another seven\npoints, scored due to a hard tackle-breaking run by Charlie, something\nthat he, along with fellow forward\nturned centre Sam, had been executing all game.\nThis left IC, in the final ten min-utes, with only a three point deficit.\nBoth teams seemed to wake up to\nthe fact that this match was still anybody\u2019s, and the intensity raised ac-cordingly. We seemed to be pushing\nup to their line slowly; unfortunate-ly, after a turnover, a Sussex boot\nsent the ball back into our territory.\nThe defence of this kick was a\nlittle scrappy and a stupid penalty\nwas awarded in front of the posts\nfor use of hands in the ruck. This\ndid not dampen IC spirit; the restart saw some super rolling forward play; helped along with good\nstrength from PCL and our Brown\nBullet Satcho.\nIn the last few phases of play, PCL\nsecured himself twat of the match\nwith a dive over the line from the\nback of the scrum to put the ball\ndown. Unfortunately, in the heat of\nthe moment, he confused the five\nmetre with the try line causing Sussex, along with everyone else, much\namusement.\nThrough the final minutes, we\nkept on fighting in vain with the\ngame ending with Sussex kicking\nthe ball out of play.\nThe mood was extremely sombre\nin the apr\u00e8s match huddle, with\nmore words from Coach Dave, leaving us with a lot of sorrows to drown\nat the Palais later that evening.\nMens Rugby\nSussex 25\nICURFC 3rd XV 19\nIC thirds taking a line out; surely that\u2019s going to hurt that gentleman\u2019s downstairs mixup? It looks painful\nAutumn has to be my favorite time\nof year; the leaves turning, conker\ncompetitions and, of course, it\u2019s often very windy! Because of the fantastic conditions this is a hectic time\nfor the windsurf club with weekly\nevents taking us all over the coun-try: Cornwall, Cardiff, Poole and\nNottingham all in the last month,\nwith Cambridge this weekend and\nExeter coming hot on its heels.\nHaving focused on the beginners\nat the awesome Aussie Kiss festival\nin Cornwall (all 700 of them) it was\nthe turn of the advanced sailors\nto show their skills at the Cardiff\nwave event over the bonfire night\nweekend.\nUnfortunately the wave series\ndidn\u2019t start with the eagerly anticipated bang as the wind decided\nnot to blow. Instead we got a final\nglimpse of summer in November;\nmany thanks to global warming!*\nDonning out favorite board shorts\nfor probably the final time this year\nImperial dominated the sun filled\nweekend. Highlights included an\nImperial one-two, from Chris and\nAlex, in the land-boarding speed\nchallenge, team victories in the\nbeach volleyball and ultimate Frisbee competitions, then wowing\nthe crowds and drinking de Apfle\nFizz as mock rock band Full Power\nplayed at the eurotrash-themed\nparty. Honoury Imperialite Lidl\nMiss Lucy won best costume (a surprisingly classy affair made entirely\nof Lidl Bags).\nA special mention must go to\nChris who somehow forward\nlooped a mountain board, attached\nto windsurf sail, on a flat beach with\nvery little wind to aid take-off.\nMostimportantlythough,wedemonstrated our engineering prowess\nby running away with the sand castle competition, bringing Egypt to\nWales, building not only the Pyramids but also a replica Sphinx. If\nyou fancy getting a bit closer to the\nreal thing, as well as some sunshine\nand wicked windsurfing, the windsurf club will be running a trip suitable for all levels to Egypt during\nthe Easter holidays; contact Chris\nfor more information at chris@im-perialwindsurf.co.uk.\nFollowing the success of the Cardiff weekend the whole club were\nreunited for the first Student Windsurf Association (SWA) core event\nof the season. SWA events are designed to let windsurfers of all levels meet up, windsurf, then party\nthe night away which is exactly\nwhat we did in Nottingham (and\nthis time it was windy)!\nWith a solid force 5 blowing and a\ngood sized chop ripping across the\nreservoir, the windsurfers threw\nthemselves out there with passion;\nwhat better way is there to clear\nyour head in the morning?\nAgain Imperial dominated com-petition, as well as being the first\nuniversity on the water. Notable\nhigh-lights included: a top 5 place\nfor Chris in a highly competitive\nFreestyle competition, a 2nd and\n3rd in the advanced racing for\nChris and Niall and top 5 places in\nthe intermediate fleet for Jahn and\nJake - and this was Jahns first SWA\nevent!\npetitions. For this we have to thank\nthe Union for its support, allowing\nthe purchase of high quality equipment which allows us to compete\nat the top levels where we couldn\u2019t\nin the past; long may it continue.\nWith 4 fully qualified instructors\nand many old hands happy to throw\na tip your way, the windsurf club\nprovides the ideal environment for\npeople to take the first steps in the\nsport or show off their skills to an\neducated audience. If you like what\nWhat did the Romans ever do for\nus? Toga, toga, toga! To celebrate\nanother Saturday, 200 windsurfers graced Nottingham in evening\nwear- fashioned from bed sheets,\nsafety pins, leaves, a toy sword or\ntwo and a smidgen of face paint. I\nthink it will suffice to say for now it\nwas fun... wasn\u2019t it, Jake? Yvonne?\nThe Imperial windsurf club is going from strength to strength this\nyear; making an impact not only on\nthe dance floor but also at top com-you hear and would like some further information please contact us\nat committee@imperialwindsurf.\nco.uk or pop along to our weekly\nsocials.\n* The windsurf club does not\nendorse the abuse of our planet,\nin fact, far from it; every SWA\nevent is carbon neutral making\nsure we don\u2019t leave an unwanted\nfootprint on our future.\nNiall Thomson\n\n"

    "content": "O\nn November 9th,\nSony Computer Entertainment Europe\nannounced that the\nPlaystation 2 had\nbecome the best-selling computer\nentertainment system in Europe.\nHaving sold 40 million units, it overtook its predecessor by a few hundred thousand units. David Reeves,\nSCEE President and CEO, cited\nthat \u201cthe social gaming phenomena such as EyeToy, SingStar and\nBUZZ!\u201d were a major factor in the\nPS2\u2019s success.\nSo, quick question here, what do\nall these games have in common? If\nyou said that they all use peripher-als, give yourself half a point. The\ntrue answer is that they appeal to\na wider audience, so a more pertinent question would be: does a\ngame that appeals to a wider audience require a peripheral?\nIt must certainly help. Gaetan\nLee, one of the main organisers of\nthe science museum\u2019s Game On\nexhibition, told Stoic TV in a recent\ninterview \u201cif you see a device that\nlooks like a guitar, you know what\nyou\u2019re meant to do with it; you pick\nup a microphone, you know what to\ndo with it.\u201d In an industry where input is generalised to something as\ngeneric as possible, seeing something that\u2019s familiar can be a real\nincentive to give it a try.\nOf course, that\u2019s only one type of\nperipheral. If you want full immer-sion, you could always give Steel\nBattalion\u2019s controller a try. Involving two control sticks and around 40\nbuttons, including one for washing\nthe windscreen, it is one of the most\ncomplicated gaming peripherals in\nexistence. My friend Tom and I had\na go on it at the aforementioned\nexhibition and during a play, Tom\nexclaimed \u201cHow do you get it to go\nforward?\u201d \u201cYou have to press one of\nthe pedals,\u201d I said, to which he replied in horror \u201cthere are pedals!?\u201d\nNew breeds of control freak\nBecause real gamers don\u2019t waggle joysticks all the time, explains Chris Hemmens\nOut now\n\u201cRaiden, turn the game console off right now!\u201d\nModern peripheral gaming grew\nout of the success of Dance Dance\nRevolution and other dancing\ngames as they made their transition from the arcade to the home in\n1999. In the good old days, peripherals tended to come in the form\nof either steering wheels or arcade\nsticks. Guns also featured in the retail sector, though they embodied\nwilder designs, as owners of SNES\u2019s\nsuper scope can attest. Rhythm action games caused a stir as a wider\nvariety of inputs were concocted.\nWhereas steering wheels and the\nlike fit one model that could apply\nto a genre as a whole, in the years\nFelix Games knows a lot about you,\nreader. We know what college you\ngo to, what your favourite student\npaper is, and we also know exactly\nwhat noise you make when given a\nplastic guitar and a copy of Guitar\nHero II. It goes a little something\nlike this \u2013 \u201cWeeeooooww weowowowowowwww.\u201d and then you twiddle your left hand a bit. You get the\nidea.\nYes, it\u2019s expensive, and yes, you\nmight feel it a bit short-lived if all\nyou\u2019re going to do is play it on your\nown. But you\u2019re never going to play\na game quite like Guitar Hero, and\nthe sequel is every bit as entertaining as the first. One of the greatest party experiences since Dance\nDance Revolution whilst drunk.\nBut we also know that some of\nyou are a bit too refined to be prancing around with what looks like a\ndemonic sex toy in your hands, so\nfor something more cerebral this\nweek, Warhammer: Mark Of Chaos finally makes a release. It\u2019s not\nthe detail orgy that some fans may\nbe expecting, but an RTS that\u2019s well\nworth a look for those still waiting\nfor Supreme Commander.\nSpeaking of which, coming nearly\na month late for spooky season,\nRule Of Rose is out for the Playstation 2 this week. Set in 1930s England and surrounding a group of\nyoung girls called the \u201cRed Crayon\nAristocrats\u201d, RoR seems at first to\nbe usual horror fare, but the narrative really does make a change from\nthe endless combat that Silent Hill\nand Resident Evil are now plagued\nwith. And no \u2013 no, the group of girls\ndo not \u2018get it on\u2019. At all.\nThough you may be interested to\nknow that Dead Or Alive: Extreme\nBeach Volleyball 2 is still on track\nfor a Christmas release.\nWe\u2019re just saying, is all.\nA guitar hero, yesterday\n\u2013 The Colonel,\nMetal Gear Solid 2\nRule Of Rose: It\u2019s scary.

Is\nit possible that the Wii controller\nis the peripheral of all peripher-als? You may have to swing it like\na tennis racket, use it as a samurai\nsword, or even turn it like a steering wheel, but herein lies the prob-lem: it\u2019s designed to be as general\nas possible. Looking back over the\ninsurgence of peripheral gaming\nin the late 90s and early 2000s; are\nwe about to bear witness to the first\nstep in combining accessibility with\ngenerality, and how will this affect\nthe outcome of the decisions that\nthe three major hardware manufacturers have made? Sony are\nunerringly going to continue to\nmake add-ons for their machines,\nit\u2019s what they\u2019re good at and why\nthey\u2019re so popular.

    "content": "W\ne were greeted\nby a duo of mid-dle-aged leftist\nCanadian les-bians, who took\nour money whilst looking lovingly\nat one another and then promptly\nshowed us to our dormitory which\ncontained a veritable confederacy\nof non-compos. In hostels, there\nexists an almost cultish belief that\nthis is the only way to travel. This is\ndelusion on a grand scale, the constant elephant in the room being\nthe fact that hostels are basically\ncountryside hideouts for bearded\nsex-pests and socialists: two of the\nmost hideous fringe groups our\nsociety has to offer. Quite frankly,\nsharing bunk-beds with strangers\nceases to be appropriate some time\nbetween getting your bike\u2019s stabilizers removed and the dropping of\none\u2019s testicles.\nThis is not outrage at having to\nslum it, I assure you; I have stayed\nin some alarming holes in my time (I\nlive in one now, in fact). Spectacular\nmonstrosities of cockroach-mottled\nbathroom floors and flea-crusted\nbeds with gruesome stains of blood\nor vomit as a bedside companion.\nBut at least they had locks, and\nthere wasn\u2019t a blimp called Kevin\nsleeping above me who lists his\nhobbies as walking, ales, and stroking cadavers. A lock frees the mind\nfrom worries normally reserved for\nshowering convicts, and will forever\nbe my only necessity when on country jaunts. \u2018Settled in\u2019, we attacked\nthe pub with aplomb, returning\nseconds before the hostel\u2019s curfew\n\u2013 covered head to foot in stings resulting form an ill-advised, alcohol\nkindled leap over a wall into a well-cultivated patch of angry nettles.\nDay one: success!\nThe next day we wake early to the\nsight of a bulging, bearded galoot\nwearing only loose pants. Dressing\nhastily with eyes averted we stoically shake off hangovers and stride\nout onto the hills.\nMy word, are these ever hills.\nThese are merely hills, as the Eiffel\nTower is merely a jazzed up electricity pylon. The Quantocks are an\nexpanse of undulating land as far as\nthe eye can behold, you wander over\nverdurous land with sinuous sea as\na navy backdrop. We were wandering adventurers from ages past, but\ninstead of hunting for food to support clans, we were hunting for the\npub over the hills. Dressed in jeans\nand t-shirts, we spectacularly blew\napart the dogmas of the GoreTex\nbrigade: loners with an outward-bound store upon their back and a\nscowl on their face. They walk up\nand up, grinding towards their goal\nthen reach the top, mark a tick in a\nleather notepad, and walk straight\nback down to the nearest festering\nhostel. To hell with them. We were\ninnovators; we climbed the Quantocks highest peak and feasted on\nslightly rotten chicken and Chianti\nof an unknown age.\nYes, we stumbled through a deer\nsanctuary in a haze; yes, we practised Karate Kid moves on a fallen\ntree in a wood; but we conquered\nthose hills like no GoreTex-monkey ever will, and after five hours\nin a pub we found ourselves in pitch\ndarkness: back on our conquered\nhills, lost and very afraid.\nSomehow we had wandered off\ninto marshland and were now knee-deep in sludge. We were inebriated\nand, owing to fear, had worsened\nthe situation by topping up our\nlevels with the emergency whis-key. Fear had claimed me. I heard\ndistant mammalian noises: \u2018Iain,\nare those wolves?\u2019 I asked, \u2018Shit.\nWolves.\u2019 It took us an age to figure\nout that they were just geese. Sadly,\nwe were still lost on a Quantock.\nEscaping the marshland, we came\nupon a wire fence at the foot of the\nslope. We had to try. Just making it\nover, I looked over my shoulder just\nin time to see Big Iain come close\nbut fall at the last, jagged hurdle.\nIf you have never seen a 6\u2019 7\u201d man\nskewered on a barbed wire fence,\nI can assure you it is a sight to\nbehold.\nLike an abandoned marionette\nflung haphazardly on the floor,\nstrings knotted and tangled, Iain\nwas attached at the arm. \u201cI\u2019m\nstuck,\u201d he said morosely. I laughed;\nhe swore. For seemingly an age he\nstruggles; finally looking up, with a\nlook of terminal despondency, say-ing: \u201cjust go on without me.\u201d I remembered all the Vietnam films I\u2019d\never seen. When you\u2019re in the suck\nsoldier, you never leave a man be-hind! We heave and twist, scream\nat each other until finally he is free\nand over the barbed obstacle. We\nscramble up the slick, muddy slope,\nand at the top strain our eyes in\nthe moonlight examining the deep\nblue rivulets trickling down Iain\u2019s\narm. The relief is palpable and, a\nfew hundred feet along the path, we\nsee the landing strip of life beneath\nus signifying our village, and (more\nimportantly) the pub. Quantocks\nconquered again.\nT\nhe next morning we\nwake, and beard and\npants man tell us the\nsocialist Canadians are\nafter us. Perhaps we\nstormed in post-libations, and tore\nthe hostel apart \u2013 waking everyone and causing much distress. We\npack and escape through the back\ndoor. The best way to escape an enraged crocodile is to run in zigzags.\nTheir turning circle and lumbering\nmass are such that the scaled monster cannot work with either the zig\nor the zag for sustained periods of\ntime. Socialist-Lesbian-Canadians,\nhowever, are not flummoxed by the\nzigzag, or indeed sprints through\ndense woodland. They are an angry\nbunch, a hardy predator, and a worthy foe to the city-dweller seeking\nnourishment from the verdant teat\nof Somerset.\nThe above chase is a fabrication,\nI admit. The lesbian-Canadians\nmerely wanted to pleasantly thank\nus for purchasing them milk the\nprevious night. It was the countryside that made me re-arrange the\ntruth: it enervates the spirit and\ndemands the elevation of the mundane to the intrepid. The ladies\nquizzing me on my socialist virtues\n(lost in a near-fatal collision with reality in 1999) was not enough. The\nQuantocks had caused my heart to\ndemand the chase!\nSomerset is London\u2019s antithesis\nand its spiritual nemesis. Somerset is the Arcadian Albion that\nColeridge and Wordsworth cooed\nover \u2013 \u201cSo will I build my altar in\nthe fields / And the blue sky my\nfretted dome shall be.\u201d Beauteous,\nrolling England distilled perfectly.\nLondon is Dante\u2019s first circle of hell\n\u2013 metropolitan nightmare, chaotic\nand lung-chokingly smoggy, but essential and somehow we think it\u2019s\nabsolutely wonderful, just a little\nbit better than the rest of Lucifer\u2019s\ndomain.\nSo for goodness sake go and enjoy\nthe nation fate has bestowed upon\nus. Forget middle-class wet dreams\nof Tuscany and the Algarve. The\nQuantocks can change us all. But\nbefore departing, be sure to learn\nthe words to \u2018Jerusalem\u2019, or your\ntrip will be entirely pointless.\nTop: no explanation was offered with this picture. I\u2019m sure it made sense at the time\nMiddle: Iain, presumably after his battle with a fence, pretending he\u2019s some kind of commando\nBottom: the beautiful countryside; spoiled by a shot of Peter\u2019s boxer shorts as he attempts a cartwheel\n5\nfelix\nFriday 24 November 2006\nTRAVEL felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Friday 24 November 2006\nfelix\nIt may come as a surprise to most\nbut on previous albums Diddy didn\u2019t\nseem to mind sharing the limelight\nwith his collaborators. His previous two releases, We Invented The\nRemix Vol. 1 and The Saga Continues\u2026 were both co-credited to \u2018The\nBad Boy Family\u2019, which was only\nfair considering the amount they\ncontributed to them.\nSo when his latest offering was\nstrictly credited to \u2018Diddy\u2019, you\u2019d\nexpect it to be a one-man show\nstarring the self-proclaimed king of\nNew York, but you\u2019d be wrong.\nIn fact, Press Play features over 20\ndifferent guest appearances (which\nmust be some kind of record) and\nthat doesn\u2019t include the big-name\nproducers who have left marks all\nover the record. From the likes of\nChristina Aguilera and lead Pussycat Doll, Nicole, to edgier artists\nlike Nas and Mary J. Blige. It\u2019s an\norgy and everyone\u2019s invited to help\nresurrect Diddy\u2019s fading rap career\nand record label.\nThe first song off this album,\nCome to Me, really wasn\u2019t a true\nrepresentation of the album. It was\npretty weak for a lead single and\ngave the impression that Press\nPlay might not live up to the hype\nsurrounding it. Fortunately, Come\nTo Me was a fluke and the record\nhas enough bubble-gum rap to keep\nmainstream listeners happy. A\ngood example is the potent Tell Me,\nfeaturing Christina Aguilera which\nis set to be the next single off the al-bum, and it is bound to be huge.\nThe first few tracks, We Gon\u2019 Make\nIt, I Am, The Future, are devoted to\nDiddy\u2019s ego, telling us how he's not\ngoing anywhere and declaring himself the king of New York. He also\nmakes a threat of running for President. These brags and boasts are a\nstandard feature of any contemporary rap album but great rap artists\nknow to keep it smart and keep it to\na minimum. Unfortunately, Diddy\nisn\u2019t a great rapper and this inevitably takes over and becomes the\ntheme for a sizeable chunk of the\nalbum.\nWhen he does take time out from\nkissing his own rear and tries to\ntackle other rap staples \u2013 mainly\nhooking up and breaking up \u2013 he is a\nbit more interesting and it becomes\nevident that his rhyming skills have\nimproved. However, it is a problem\nthat he is still not as proficient as he\nthinks he is.\nThe best songs are the ones where\nDiddy's run-of-the-mill rap verses\nare broken up by catchy choruses\nby a guest vocalist or delivered over\ninfectious beats. In a nutshell, it is\nnever because of Diddy's skills as\nan MC but more because he has talented friends.\nSo will he have you itching to\nPress Play? Well, honestly, yes, he\nScott Walker\nThe Drift\n(4AD)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nShiny Toy Guns\nLe Disko\n(Mercury)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nsingle review\nWhole batchful of releases for you\nEnjoy some of the reviews of the singles and albums that we\u2019ve had a listen to in these past few weeks\nalbum review\nwill.

These include After Love, Tell Me and the bumping\nLast Night.\nJemil Salami\nP Diddy\nPress Play\n(Atlantic)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nScott Walker has had a quite remarkable career. In the mid-60's,\nhe was lead singer of The Walker\nBrothers, a hugely successful vocal\npop group. At the height of fame,\nhe left them to pursue a solo career singing Jacques Brel-inspired\nchansons. The 70s saw the increasingly reclusive artist slowly fade\ninto obscurity. His last ever tour\nwas in 1978 and his 1984 album, Climate of Hunter became the biggest\ncommercial failure in the history\nof Virgin Records. After that, there\nwas silence. For 11 years.\nThen came Tilt. An unashamedly difficult album that was unlike anything before it. Tilt was\ndark and stripped down; a barren\nmonolith constructed of monotonous rhythms, sweeping orchestral\ntextures, weird sound experiments\nand operatic vocals. Needless to\nsay, it didn't even make it close to\nthe mainstream. However, it became an instant classic with the\nmore open-minded (Goldfrapp,\nBrian Eno and David Bowie among\nothers, have praised it highly). It\nmay not come as a surprise that it's\ntaken Walker another 11 years to\nproduce a follow-up, with everyone\nwondering how he could possibly\noutdo himself.\nAs it turns out, it's actually quite\nsimple; by taking things even fur-ther. While Tilt had its occasional\nrays of sunshine, The Drift offers\nonly undiluted fear, pain and de-spair. There are no more melodies\nand no more grand arrangements,\nonly ominous, brooding soundscapes alternating with brutal outbursts of pure dissonance. And, of\ncourse, some of the most bizarre\nnoises ever integrated into music; a\nslab of meat being punched, someone walking up the stairs, a tortured\ndonkey, a Donald Duck imitation\nand lots of unidentifiable chirping,\nhissing and rattling.\nOn top of all this looms Walker's\nbaritone, reciting surreal lyrics\nabout such cheerful topics as Mussolini's execution, Elvis Presley's\nstillborn brother, 9/11, famine and\nthe war in Bosnia. The result is perhaps the most nightmarish, most\nintensely unsettling record I've\never heard \u2013 and I've heard a lot of\nsick stuff.\nI'm not sure I can give you an\naccurate impression of The Drift,\nsimply because there is nothing\nlike it out there. It's perhaps closer\nto the work of modern composers\nlike Sch\u00f6nberg than to anything in\nthe popular music world.\nThe majority of you would absolutely hate it. But if you have an\nadventurous mind and you'd like to\nhear some of the most unique and\nbrilliant music being made today, I\nurge you to give The Drift a try.\nRalf Damaschke\nWith the best band name I have\nheard for a long time, I was expecting much from Shiny Toy Guns.\nI was not disappointed! Le Disko\nstarts off with ethereal swirling key-boards, before the pounding synths\nthat drive the record forward kick\nin. The seductive angst filled vocals of 19-year-old lead singer, Carah Faye complements the driving\nrhythm brilliantly, and works well\nwith the backing vocals of bassist\nChad Petree. Then, at the bridge\nthe whole song changes, from a\nclaustrophobic electronic blast to\nsounding like Abba being fronted by\nBjork! The song as a whole is filled\nwith hundreds of electronic effects,\nbut unlike lesser bands, the music\nnever loses its clarity and sense of\nprogression.\nThe b-side, Starts With One follows the same electro-rock sensi-bilities, but the two singers swap\nduties, injecting a little more variety into proceedings.\nShiny Toy Guns are already starting to make a name for themselves,\nhaving the most requested song on\nthe influential KROQ Los Angeles,\nbefore even being signed. The band\nput their snowballing popularity\ndown to the internet, saying, \u201cZeroes and ones are a nuclear weapon\nfor a band.\u201d If Shiny Toy Guns can\nkeep up the good work, and perhaps expand their sound a little into\nnew areas, then they really will be a\ncreative force to be reckoned with\nin the future.\nTom Roderick\nalbum review\nOrson\nAlready Over\n(Mercury)\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nsingle review\nSigned by Mercury Records in November of 2005, Orson closed the\nyear as support on the UK leg of the\nDuran Duran arena tour and were\nstill largely an unknown band but\nthat has changed since the turn of\nthe year.\nBefore they released their debut\nsingle, No Tomorrow, the band had\nalready graced the cover of The\nSunday Times Culture supplement,\nmade their debut performance on\nTop of the Pops and been playlisted\nby every station in the land from\nRadio1 to Xfm. Quite a bit of exposure by all accounts.\nOn release, No Tomorrow entered the chart at number five, but\nwithin two weeks had risen like an\nold-fashioned hit record to take its\nplace at the top of the charts. In\nfact, it was still in the top five seven\nweeks after release. Unfortunately,\nI doubt if their latest single, Already\nOver, would have the same inpact.\nThis tracks sounds like album filler and doesn\u2019t show the uniqueness\nNo Tomorrow brought to our ster-eos. We can hope for the best from\nthe Orson and this isn\u2019t it.\nFolake Adegbohun\nGnarls Barkley\nWho Cares\n(Warner Music)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nsingle review\nGnarls Barkley, an Atlanta collaboration between Maryland-based DJ\nand producer Danger Mouse (Bri-an Burton) and rapper/singer CeeLo (Thomas Callaway). Their first\nalbum, St. Elsewhere, was released\nby Warner Music in April 2006 in\nthe UK. They stormed the UK with\nthe amazing single, Crazy. Now\nthe creative duo have a new single\ncalled Who Cares, which is pure\ngenius. With skilful Cee-Lo dropping some imaginative and ambitious vocals on this track. Although\nthis single has a very summery vibe\nto it and might not have the great\nsuccess of Crazy, it is definitely a\nGnarls Barkley signature single in\nits own right.\nFolake Adegbohun\nFreddie Freeloader\nThis is Powergrunge\n(Self-release)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nEP review\nThis band coined their style early\non as \u2018powergrunge\u2019 (a combination\nof grunge, funk, groove and metal).\nPowergrunge harkens back to early\nfunksters such as the Red Hot Chili\nPeppers and Faith No More, with\nthe addition of much heavier metal\nguitar riffs on the top, whilst the\nsinger\u2019s elegantly sung vocals help\nsteer the band away from nu-met-al. There is great potential for this\nband. Let\u2019s hope they fulfil it.\nRobin Smith\nShiny Toy Guns looking\u2026 shiny and generally sexy; they\u2019re bringing chavvy back\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12\n\n"

There were\nseveral great runs for goal by the\nnewly recruited Miss Willy, \u201cKa`ie\nfrm Lu`on\u201d and Dasha, who all\nworked beautifully upfront throughout the game.\nEncouraging words such as\n\u201cWho\u2019s got the fucking post?\u201d and\n\u201cWho\u2019s covering this bitch?\u201d could\nbe heard throughout the match\nfrom MJ Spammy, in goal, who\nwas awarded champagne moment\nfor her stunning acrobatic skills in\ngoal, including a split save in the\nsecond half that would have made\nthe crudest of you blush.\nTowards the end of the first half\nthe lung burn had set in for most.\nThe tables may have turned had it\nnot been for the amazing efforts of\nThe Crowther, in defence, who easily regained and dispersed any balls\nthat came our way with the skill and\npower that we mortals can simply\ndream about.\nThe score at half time was still nil-nil, which did not reflect the effort\nthe entire team was making but was\nmore a reflection of the bias umpiring (Mikey and Pikey - tut tut!) that\ntook place through out the game\n(was that 20 short corners?).\nRSM Ladies Hockey\nRSM 1st XI 1\nRoyal Holloway 3rd XI 0\nAfter a brief tactical meeting\nat half time we were back on the\npitch, coming on strong and looking\nto get our goal. It came soon after\nhalf time; a stunning hit from The\nCrowther to Els Bells in midfield,\nwho passed it onto the Willy, who\nspanked it to Ka\u2019ie on the post, who\nbrought home the goal!\nWith 20 minutes to go and a slowly\ndying team, we could have strug-gled, but for the defensive efforts of\nDawn, Kate, Alice C, Elly and Ally\nwho repeatedly kept Holloway at\nbay. Special mention to Alice R who\nran out every short corner (yes,\nall 20 of them!) making sure they\nweren\u2019t successful.\nAllinallafantasticstarttotheseason; special thanks to the boys who\nstuck around to cheer us on, and to\nPikey and Mikey for umpiring.\nMan of the Match was a close call\nbetween Sara and Welshy but Willy\ngot the last vote which secured her\nthe dirrrrrty pint. I\u2019d like to thank\neveryone for turning up and putting\nin such an amazing effort. There\nwasn\u2019t a single slacker on the team\n(apart from me) which is great go-ing, and we can\u2019t wait until the next\nmatch!\nA note from Alice Rowlands,\nSports Editor:\nCharlotte was not \u201cslacking\u201d; she\nwas working bloody hard throughout the whole match, hence the\nrather red face she was sporting\nfollowing the match!

    "content": "Next generation gaming has begun\nTomo Roberts gives his verdict on whether you should go for a Wii this Christmas or hold out for a PS3\nW\nith the imminent release of\nthe Nintendo Wii\nworldwide and\nthe third incarnation of the Sony PlayStation already\navailable in Japan and the USA, the\ncompanies\u2019marketingdepartments\nare working overtime to create the\nloudest buzz about their respective\nconsoles.\nOn Monday 13th November, I was\nlucky enough to be given the chance\nto put both consoles through the\npaces. The opportunity arose when\nRadio 1\u2019s technology reporter Iain\nMackenzie posted on a message\nboard I regularly view, requesting\na number of gamers to come along\nand try out the two next-gen ma-chines. The catch? Unfortunately,\nmasses of listeners had to be subjected to my not-so-dulcet tones\nas my analysis soared out over the\nairwaves.\nI was giddy with excitement; partly because I felt like a member of an\nexclusive \u2018I\u2019ve played the Wii and\nPS3, who wants to touch me?\u2019 club,\nbut mainly because both consoles\nare ones that I can\u2019t wait to get my\ngrubby mitts on. So far, I\u2019ve held out\nfrom buying an Xbox 360. I\u2019ve come\nclose at times with the allure of\nDead Rising and Table Tennis especially beckoning me to purchase\nMicrosoft\u2019s beast, but the price tag\nhas remained beyond my cash-strapped reach. With Christmas\nand my birthday around the corner,\nMicrosoft and Nintendo will need to\nconvince me to buy their console.\nOr, would I hold out until next year\nand hand over a chunk of my student loan for Sony\u2019s latest offering?\nAs each generation of consoles\nare gradually ushered in, a number\nof decisions have to be made. Which\nhas the best games? Best graphics?\nWhich justifies its price tag most\nsufficiently? But whereas my previous console choices have often been\nmade largely on the basis of which\ncompany offered my favourite exclusive titles, this upcoming cycle\nof consoles each offer a varied and\ndiverse package compared to their\ncompetitors \u2013 something arguably\nunseen in previous generations.\nOn one hand, Microsoft offers\nhigh definition graphics, some\ncracking original IP and a superbly\nimplemented online experience\nthanks to the company\u2019s expertise\nin this area, all at a very reasonable\nasking price. The PS3 claims to offer all this and then some whilst\nprobably being capable of frying\nyou breakfast somewhere inside its\nshiny plastic casing. But coming in\nat \u00a3425 you might expect it to rear\nthe porky pigs too. On the freakish\nthird hand, Nintendo\u2019s baby cannot compete graphically. However\nthe Wii is a courageous attempt to\nrevolutionise the way we interact\nwith games using a motion sensitive controller whist remaining affordable at \u00a3179.\nPre-orders for the Nintendo Wii\nbegan last month, but I was tentative when deciding to put my name\ndown for one. From videos and\nother peoples\u2019 impressions, I was\nconcerned the \u2018Wiimote\u2019 was inac-curate, often shaking around er-ratically. Videos of the next Zelda\nincarnation showed Link\u2019s archery\nskills leaving a lot to be desired, as\nhe zipped in an instant from looking at the sky to staring at his feet.\nWas it the player\u2019s fault or were the\nshakes setting into the young lad\u2019s\nbones? As with all new technology,\ncaution is required and Nintendo\nhad to answer the question persistently nagging me. Simply: does it\nwork?\nAs for the PS3, which is not arriving in Europe until March, I was eager to see how much of a leap Sony\nhad made from the PlayStation 2\nand whether it could justify such a\nhefty price tag.\nF\nour eager gamers arrived\noutside the \u2018Wii House\u2019\nbright and early on the\nMonday morning. Situated on a quiet residential\nstreet in Holborn, this was the last\nplace we expected such a massive\ncorporation to hold its latest money\nmaking machine. The Wii House\ncontained five floors of a gamer\u2019s\nnirvana: spotlessly clean minimalist contemporary furnishings,\ncomplimentary biscuits and drinks,\nroughly ten to twenty Wiis and an\nattractive PR lady to greet and tend\nto our needs.\nFirst off, we were taken to the\nfirst floor lounge where I managed to sneak in a few minutes on\nWarioWare Smooth Moves. A four\nplayer game of tennis on Wii Sports\nwas already prepared for us, but\nwhilst my other three companions\nstretched and jogged on the spot,\nI had instantly taken control of the\nWiimote and \u2018nunchaku\u2019 for two\nbrief mini games on WarioWare.\nNo sooner than I\u2019d plucked a man\u2019s\nnose hair, I was thrust a different\nremote ready for tennis.\nWithin the first game, I felt immediately familiar with the remote.\nThe tennis game required only use\nof the Wiimote. Strokes were exactly as you imagine, with the console\nrecognising the difference between\nbackhands, lobs, dinks and passes.\nIt was my turn to serve. I flicked\nthe remote upwards, and then\nstruck the \u201cball\u201d with an emphatic\noverhead swing. Ace! Take that! No\nsooner than I tossed up my next\nserve, the ball was immediately\ncoming back across court. Damn.\nMy ego took a bashing as my second serve was returned across\ncourt with authority. As the games\nprogressed, my competitive nature\nbegan to rear its ugly nature to the\ndispleasure of my right elbow. Even\na simple tennis game such as this\nmanaged to flex my muscles using the Wiimote. Once the chalk\nhad settled thought, each of us was\nsporting a beaming smile.\nTen-pin bowling was up next. The\ngraphics in both this and the tennis\nwere clean, colourful and certainly\nfunctional. Whilst Wii Sports was\ncertainly not pushing the console\u2019s\ngraphical prowess, it was immediately obvious that the console would\nnever ever be challenging the Xbox\n360 and PS3 in a beauty contest.\nThe Nintendo Wii, three Wiimotes and the infra red emitter bar due out in Europe on December 8th\nFour intrigued gamers listening intently whilst receiving coaching tips before getting stuck into a round of tennis on Wii Sports\n14 felix Friday 24 November 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Barbed wire, lesbians, and poetry\nPeter Dominiczak and a man known only as Big Iain explore England\u2019s near-mythical hills, the Quantocks\nA\ns a Scotsman, I had\nalways been of the\nopinion that England\u2019s\nlandscapes were no\nmore than the unwanted bastard children of the Highlands; the lands which the glaciers\nfelt too beneath them to twist and\ntrample beneath their icy mass,\nleaving them flat and pointless,\nuseful only for daffodils and Little\nChefs. I always thought of Scotland as Zeus atop Olympus; violent,\nmagnificent and powerful, hurling\nbolts of lightning down at inferior\nEngland below \u2013 mere mortals at\nthe foot of the mountain, having a\ngood think, nibbling feta, and bending over.\nBut a couple of years living with an\nEnglishman who gets teary at the\nvery thought of an oak tree has softened my heart and, bags packed, I\ndecided it was time to venture forth\ninto Albion; leaving preconceptions\nbehind in jagged glens and crys-tal-clear lochs. Compete, England,\ncompete. Deciding where to go was\nproblematical, like choosing between the various shades of brown\npaint at B&Q. There were dales and\nmoors, coves, caves, meadows and\nmarsh. But out of nowhere, from\nthe very depths of my soul, poured\nthe word that would change eve-rything: Quantocks. Now virtually\nnobody in England knows where\nthe Quantocks are, or if in fact they\nexist at all. They are a void, a fable;\nlike Narnia, or the Midlands. Big\nIain \u2013 travelling companion, giant,\nand English patriot \u2013 suggested\nthat the Quantocks were possibly\na distant galaxy visited on occasion\nby television\u2019s own Lycra-clad fools,\ntrekking the stars, seeking out\nknowledge and females that would\nfinally touch them. Inspection of a\ncartographer\u2019s magical produce revealed that the Quantocks exist in\nSomerset, just over the water from\nCardiff, in that area of the world\nwhere people insist on worshipping\nlarge stones and oftentimes apples.\nWe were off.\nGetting to the Quantocks is a kind\nof township-filtration process, taking one through more and more trifling places, until you finally arrive\nin \u2018nowhere\u2019 \u2013 the wondrous centre\nof absolutely, bloody nowhere - and\nfall to the ground, writhing in rural\necstasy. First the bus rolls through\nBristol \u2013 giving me just enough\ntime to caress civilisation once\nmore \u2013 and then onwards to uninspiring Taunton, the \u2018hub\u2019 of Somerset. For a hub, Taunton contains\nlittle more than a few idiot youths\nclad in garish sportswear, inhaling\nspray meant only for their grubby,\nmiscreant underarms. Taunton\nalso contains one or two pubs selling oddly fruity beer to idiot adults\nwho clearly misspent their own\nyouths inhaling the same sprays as\ntheir inglorious progeny. We sit and\nwatch these semi-vegetative goons,\nnow able only to slump awkwardly,\nbeer clenched tight, exclaiming\nfour-lettered examples of finest\nSaxon lingo, and occasionally creating a unique sort of art atop the\nmahogany bar with their dribble.\nAll hail Taunton!\nTrundling further into unknown\nEngland, we are distilled to our penultimate destination: an unspoilt,\nperfectly formed piece of total aim-lessness. When the directions to a\nplace are given by the phrase: \u2018get\noff the bus at the smell,\u2019 one knows\nthe jackpot has been well and truly\nhit. Welcome to Watchet, Somerset:\na shatteringly pointless seaside\nretreat that does indeed exist in\nan otherworldly scent-bubble that\nnestles comfortably between sewage and the long-neglected gusset\nof a darts player. Save for the smell,\na pub, and loose connections with\nColeridge\u2019s \u2018Rime of the Ancient\nMariner\u2019, Watchet has almost no\nredeeming qualities. Its postcards\nclaim points of interest, but these\nare lies invented by the presumably now-suicidal tourist board.\nOur happiest discovery was that\nof the \u2018Gay Archer\u2019: a rather large\ngunship cloistered in the dock that\nexplained a great deal about why\nthe Iraq war has descended into\nsuch catastrophe. Much discussion\nas to who this homophobic mariner\nwas or is obviously ensued, but no\nanswers which would vindicate the\nfunding of this floating hate-crime\ncould be reached. Mr. Blair has a\nlot to answer for.\nA\nfter a final bus journey\nup-wind of the stench,\nwe neared our desti-nation: Holford. It has\nto be said that quite\nsuddenly on that bus everything\nbecame incredibly beautiful. I was\nexperiencing a kind of pastoral\nStendhal syndrome. All at once, I\nwas hit by the astounding wonder-fulness that rolling England has\nto offer. The surroundings \u2013 finally\npanoramic rather than glimpsed in\nsnatches from a grubby coach hurtling along a motorway \u2013 took on a\nnew sharpness and significance;\nhills lolling as far as the eye could\nsee. Kites, hovering delicately,\nscouted for prey and great lumbering sentry-like trees guarded\nsome gargantuan secret garden - it\nwas all quite startling. My bucolic\nrevelations were confirmed to me\nby Big Iain, who \u2013 I\u2019m not joking\n\u2013 began singing \u2018Jerusalem\u2019 to the\nmajority of the bus with the kind of\ngenuine emotion reserved for funerals or stubbed toes. I asked him\nwhat he was doing and with a tear\nin his eye he merely sighed: \u2018Ahhhhh\u2026 England. Sweet England. Oh\nlook, A copse!\u2019 and with that Jerusalem rang out once again. I tried\nto imbibe the spirit of England, revelling in the atmosphere Iain was\ncreating in his portable Albert Hall:\nthe rickety number nine to Holford,\ndriven by a cold-hearted man who\nI could only presume had suffered\nall of this many times before in the\npast.\nWe stepped off the bus to a cluster\nof cottages and a defunct pub. The\npub had been bought by two smiling\nAmericans who were in the process of renovating it in order to create \u2013 one can only assume \u2013 some\nnightmarish calamity of Yankee\nhistrionic d\u00e9cor. We trudged off,\nthinking about the arduous walk\nwe would be forced to make to the\nnext pub, but maintaining good\nspirits, safe in the knowledge that\nwithin the year those grinning\nbuffoons would either be back in\nFlorida, aghast and confused as to\nwhy farmers wouldn\u2019t want to drink\nin a Mickey Mouse-themed Olde\nEnglish Pube (sic), or \u2013 we can but\ndream \u2013 peppered with Olde English bullets. Having no real concept\nof where our accommodation was,\nwe proceeded to wander aimlessly\nup hills, dense with woodland and\nsheep. Having done our Holford\nhomework, we recognised Hodders\nCombe (a combe being one of England\u2019s more spurious geographical features. Where I come from,\nwe don\u2019t register \u2018narrow valleys\u2019,\nonly calamitous glens), and the red-brick dog pound where, a few hundred years ago, the absent-minded\nhuntsman got eaten by his once-faithful beasts. Staring at that scene\nof grizzly death, I expressed deep\nregret that Otis Ferry and company\nclearly have their hounds under\ncontrol. Past elegant thatched cottages - one which boasts of housing\nWordsworth for about three days in\n1798 - we trekked onwards; allowing ourselves a moment to recreate a scene from Robin Hood that\nwas filmed here. I was a magnificent Kevin Costner, whilst Iain performed admirably as Little John;\nfighting with big sticks and shooting\ninvisible arrows brought us closer\nto nature than ever before. It was a\nheart warming event.\nSuddenly, through a crowd of\ntrees, the hostel appeared like\nmanna from heaven, offering tired\nsouls sanctuary from all the fresh\nair. The hostel was an architectural phenomenon: an enormous\nmagnolia shack at the top of a hill,\nporches and balconies jutting out\nwilly-nilly, seemingly disrespecting\ngravity and engineering conven-tion. It didn\u2019t seem to suit Somerset\nso much as Tennessee Williams\u2019\ndeep south of the U.S.; if Marlon\nBrando had stumbled out of the\nfront door, screaming about \u2018damn\nbroads\u2019 and swigging from a bottle\nof canned heat, I would have expressed only mild surprise. Once\ninside the hostel, our zeal soon\ngave way to woe and trepidation.\nFor, you see, hostels are frequented\nby a truly alarming bunch. They are\na refuge for the great pantheon of\nthe globe\u2019s oddities and cranks.\nThe Gay Archer.

It\u2019s right that as we move\ninto our centenary year that we\u2019re\nback where we belong: leaders not\nfollowers in the national student\nmovement.

    "content": "T\nhis week, I have been\nrecovering from a terrible blow to my television viewing schedule:\nthe sorry demise of\nthe Quiz Call channel. And what\nhas the gaping hole in my life\nknown as Freeview channel 31\n(on my box, at leasat) been filled\nwith? The crime against scheduling that is Film4+1. Whoever invented video recorders is turning\nin his grave as all these needless\n\u2018+1\u2019 channels jump up and down\non his coffin. Honestly, what is the\npoint? The invention of watches\npredates even that of the VCR,\nso surely there\u2019s nothing wrong\nwith our timekeeping abilities,\nso why do channel 4 patronise us\nso? At least on E4+1 most of the\nprogrammes clock in at under an\nhour, so the dedicated viewer can\nsee the same show twice, back to\nback, but on Film4+1 we must be\ncontent with watching a film just\none and a half times, or worse!\nWhen will this madness end.\nGetting back onto things a little\nmore nightlife-related, I urge all of\nyou to let your eyes stray a little\nfurther down the page and read\nthe Our Disco preview we have\nfurnished you with this week and\nthen put on your dancing shoes\nand go! (Of course, you should\nread everything else on the page\ntoo). It\u2019s no secret that Our Disco\nhas long been one of our favourite\nclubnights here at Nightlife and\nwe are delighted to see it back\nagain.\nAlex Baldwin\nNightlife Editor\nUK hip hop scene hits Scala\nSome of the country\u2019s top hip hop acts celebrate Foreign Beggars\u2019 album launch\nArriving at The Scala in London\u2019s\nKings Cross to see one of the UK\u2019s\nlargest underground hip-hop acts,\nyou could be forgiven for asking\nyourself if you were going to get\nshot tonight. The bouncers seemed\nto understand this and were operating on similar levels of paranoia\nto West Bank checkpoint operators\nand one gained a rather more familiar experience of my anatomy than I\nusually allow so soon after meeting.\nInside, however, I was pleasantly\nreminded that this was abetter variety of UK hip-hop, where being\nstraight out of Camden, or having\nhoes in different area codes doesn\u2019t\ntake centre stage, so a refreshing\natmosphere provided a close to\nflawless night.\nImpeccable timing meant our arrival fortunately coincided with the\nbeginning of Shlomo\u2019s set. It is often\nsuggested that he now represents\nBritain\u2019s most gifted beatboxer and\nthe set was certainly amongst the\nbest I\u2019ve seen. While it can\u2019t be denied that a large part of the effect\nis down to technical skill, style and\nmusical dexterity has to be taken\ninto account. Shlomo\u2019s set demonstrated this point excellently and\nhe certainly put himself strongly in\nthe arena with other heavyweights\nsuch as Killa Kela and Mr. Mouth.\nUsing a loop sampler, a significant proportion of his set involved\nputting together a track layer by\nlayer, then finally adding the vocals\n(of these, the most memorable included \u2018I Want You Back\u2019 by Jackson Five and \u2018The Magic Number\u2019\nby De La Soul).\nAll too soon Shlomo was ushered off the stage, giving me the\nchance to explore this impressive,\nconverted cinema a little more.\nAn intermission to the Pontius Pilate reinforced my impression of\nan ethereal atmosphere, after exchanging pleasantries instead of\ndirty looks when passing through\nthe crowd, to find people freestyl-ing by the cubicles that \u2018some don\u2019t\nunderstand them\u2019 (\u201cthat was some\ndeep shit\u201d apparently).\nOne floor up, room 2 was being set\nup for the open-mic cypher that was\nbeing held at this night of so many\nattractions. This kicked off after\nthe main show and was hosted by\nHoney Brown, with beats supplied\nby DJ Snuff. Speaker\u2019s Corner regulars Rhyme Asylum, The Rippah\nand Kope among others, with more\nestablished artists on the UK hip\nhop scene, such as Kashmere, gave\nthe mic the blessing it had been an-ticipating. Speaker\u2019s Corner excels\nat what they do and pulled through\ntroubles with sound to provide entertainment and a platform of free\nspeech for anybody with the co-jones to step up on stage.\nAfter an efficiently short break\nthe beggars emerged on stage.\nFirst (and unashamedly) Orifice\nwas rapidly on the stage making\nsure none of the hype from the\nprevious performance died down.\nIn succession appeared Metropolis and Doctor Syntax, with a full\nlive band, backing vocals and variety of top British DJs, including\nIQ and Vadim, to bring the night\nto a climax. They immediately\nlaunched into a varied yet consistently great set, including many\nclassics from Asylum Speakers and\ntracks from their brand new album\n(which looks to be a sure success).\nThey had clearly done their homework before this performance and\ntruly entertained and engaged the\ncrowd. Orifice\u2019s banter continued\nthroughout the set, about moving\nto London (in 1999) and his growing love for his home city. Perhaps\nthis was a heart felt expression for\na city he has come to love and feel\nCompetition: Showtime at Egg\nat home in, or merely an attempt to\nwin over the Scala crowd. Either\nway, it would appear as though the\naudience needed little winning over\nas Foreign Beggars were hugely\napplauded as they left the stage.\nClosing the night were Scratch\nPerverts, an institution in UK\nDJing to say the least. Many, I had\nthought, may have been present\nthat night to see Scratch Perverts\nalone. However, as they walked on\nstage I was one of possibly only a\ndozen spectators to welcome them.\nSomehow, the main room had gone\nfrom being nearly full to embarrassingly empty. To make matters\nworse, as the two DJs worked their\nway through \u201cTerrorist\u201d, \u201cWitness\u201d\nand many other hip hop classics, the\naudience seemed to disintegrate\nmore and more. Nevertheless the\nduo continued long into the morning not letting this lack of audience\naffect their routine as they continued with great skill and vigour.\nAll in all the night turned out to be\na fantastic offering of music; UK hip\nhop ability at its finest! However, it\nis still disappointing to see UK acts\nas big as Foreign Beggars playing\nScala on a Wednesday night, and it\ngives a little hope for the prospects\nof other UK acts just as able but less\nestablished outside of their genre.\nMy only regret for the evening is\nmissing Kashmere, but I guess you\ncan\u2019t have it all, so I decided to console myself with some \u2018top notch\u2019\npizza prepared over the road.\nSuddenly curious as to the function of a particular lever on my\ncamera which I had used countless\ntimes, I almost saw in slow motion\nthe rear door bounce open to bring\nthe sensitive into the harsh and unforgiving light of the environment.\nQuick to react however, my fears of\na ruined roll of film, and the tedium\nof now having to track down photos of the night, replaced by relief\nonce development was finished. In\nfact, I was quite pleased with the\none photo that was sodomised by\nthe event. My precious silver-halide\ncrystals were clearly in no mood for\nbeing tampered with, and left me\nwith what I think is a fitting image\nto summarise the evening.\nLaurence Fahrni\nForeign Beggars\nAlbum Launch Party\nScala\nHHHHI\nI have absolutely no idea what is happening in this picture\nOn Saturday 2nd December, \u2018Showtime presents...\u2019 is back to celebrate the holiday season in true\nfestive style with a very special and\nexclusive pantomime performance\nfrom Jonny Woo and his friends\nperformed to a backdrop of London\u2019s finest cutting edge house and\nelectro music.\nThe newest addition to Saturday\nnights at Egg incorporates live\nmusic, cabaret, VJs and a host of\ninternationally talented DJs.

    "content": "A\nshort taxi journey later\nand we were sitting on\nthe sofas in the Radio\n1Xtra meeting lounge.\nA massive 40\u201d plus flat\nscreen television was hooked up\nthe PlayStation 3. Unfortunately,\nthe HDMI cable hadn\u2019t arrived so\nthe games wouldn\u2019t be running\nin complete high definition glory.\nUpon initial inspection, the console\nwas smaller than I expected. Whilst\nslightly larger than the Xbox 360, it\nwas deadly silent even when churning out the graphics of some seriously good-looking games.\nMotorstorm was up first. Eventually, that is. The PS3 was one of the\ndebugunitssenttopresscompanies\nand as such, the games frequently\ntook longer than five minutes to\nload. Once we were in the driving\nseat of a massive truck, it was reaffirmed that the Wii would never be\nnearing these visuals. Even without\nan HD cable Motorstorm looked\nnext-gen. Racing against ten or\nmore computer controller vehicles,\nwith mud flying everywhere, huge\ndraw distances and highly realistic\nphysics, the PS3 hadn\u2019t even shifted\ninto second gear. It remained confidently silent \u2013 I could see Sony\nComputer Entertainment\u2019s CEO\nKen Kutaragi\u2019s smug smile inside\nthe shiny black casing.\nMotorstorm also utilised the tilt\nsensitivity that the new SIXAXIS\ncontroller possesses. Interestingly,\nit functioned well as an alternative\nto the analogue sticks. It\u2019s doubtful\nthat you would use it instead, but it\nplayed better than Carbon on the\nWii. All in all, the SIXAXIS remains\nvery faithful to the original PlayStation controller. The new L2 and R2\nbuttons are depressible, similarly\nto the GameCube\u2019s shoulder but-tons. Overall it feels slightly lighter\nwithout the cord and rumble feature inside. The other gamers believed it felt like a rushed piece of\nkit, but I failed to comprehend this\n\u2013 after all, if it ain\u2019t broke...\nBack into FPS territory, we fired\nup Resistance: Fall Of Man. Taking\nelements from world war shooters,\nGears Of War, Half Life many other\nsuccessful FPS games, I was most\nexcited about this compared to the\nother PS3 titles. Whereas Zelda had\nappeared washed out, Resistance\nwas plainly lacking in colour. The\nmonochrome backdrop was harking back to the days of pig-stickers\nand Carbines, but felt pointless in\na world repeatedly recreated, only\nnow it was populated with aliens.\nOnce again though, the PS3 didn\u2019t\nstruggle in the slightest when\nchurning out the detailed graph-ics. Everything ran smoothly and\nnot a signal incident of tearing was\nspotted by my eagle-eyed acquaint-ances. Whilst the game play was\nsolid, I was reminded of EA\u2019s Black,\na game that I became very bored of\nonce I got over the fact I could blow\nthe shit out of almost anything on\nscreen. Resistance lacked destructive environments too, so by comparison I should have been greatly\ndisappointed. However, the story\nwas appealing and if the developers\nhave nailed the narrative and created exciting set pieces, Resistance\ncould certainly be a must have.\nThe rest of the afternoon was\nspent playing Ridge Racer 7, Genji:\nDays Of The Blade and Formula\n1 Championship Edition. RR7\nwas exactly as expected \u2013 more of\nthe same, but at blisteringly high\nspeeds with slightly shiner graph-ics. I\u2019d rather wait for the coconuts\nto fall from the palm trees in the\nbackground than play any more\nof the games in the series, but for\nfans, this version should be no less\nessential than the others. After a\nten-minute unskippable cutscene,\nGenji wowed us with some fierce\nfire effects, but after mashing the X\nbutton for a thousandth time, we\u2019d\nhad enough of pummelling useless\nsamurai enemies. Formula 1 was a\npleasant surprise once it entered\nthe PS3\u2019s Blu-ray drive, recreating\nthe sport to a precision that has\nnever been seen before. The cars\nroared round the bends, you could\nfeel the smooth carbon fibre bodies and taste the petrol fumes in\nthe roof of your mouth. I never expected to be so impressed by such\na launch friendly title.\nOn our journey to the nearest\ntube station after leaving the Radio 1 towers, we shared our views\nand tried to draw some conclu-sions. It was agreed that the PS3\nwas stunning visually, but it\u2019s arguable whether the launch titles are\nnext-gen. Motorstorm impressed\nthe others more than myself, but\nmy apathy for racing games is the\nlikely explanation for this. Whilst\nthis and Resistance had potential,\nthe launch line up appears vastly\nunderwhelming. However, the PS3\nhas so much more to offer than just\ngames including a Blu-ray player,\nLinux compatibility and a whole\nhost of multimedia features. But,\nthe touchy issue about price cannot\nbe avoided. At a minimum of \u00a3425\nwithout games, controllers and an\nHD television, the PS3 is an expensive acquisition. Come Spring 2007,\nwe should expect to see Singstar\navailable in the launch window\nalong with a few other excellent\nSony exclusives, but even then I\ncould never justify buying a PS3.\nAnother 12 \u2013 18 months down the\nline and the story may be completely different. Final Fantasy XIII and\nMetal Gear Solid 4: Guns Of The\nPatriots are killer-apps that many,\nincluding myself, will be gagging\nfor. But until mid 2008, resist the\ntemptation to queue when you see a\nlong line of people outside GAME in\nMarch. Besides, you might get shot\nin a drive-by if the American launch\nis anything to go by.\nIn the meantime, if you really\nneed a truly next-gen fix, Bill Gates\nis the man whose pension fund you\nneed to donate too. Personally, I\u2019ve\ngone for a Wii. [Ed - 2300 words before for the first piss joke! Not bad!]\nThe remote controller is a revelation \u2013 it is precise, intuitive and a\ngenuinely successful alternative to\nconventional game pads. My pre-order is submitted and although\nyou\u2019d be lucky to find a place still\ntaking them, I suggest you beg,\nsteal or sell your gran to grab one.\nGo on, it\u2019ll put a smile on your face.\nPS3 exclusive Motorstorm looking stunning even without running in high definition Unfortunately, \u00a3425 will only get you a PS3 in March and not the girl\nPHOTOGRAPHS OF LADY WITH PS3 PROVIDED BY EUROGAMER.NET\n16 felix Friday 24 November 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

It\nwas very hard to find Episode VI because I went around looking for it and I went outside! Eventually I\nfound it. I think it\u2019s more violent than the other one and it\u2019s not suitable for kids under three. It was very\nhard \u2013 even I can\u2019t do it! I think this game is not as good as Lego Star Wars.\u201d\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nW\nhat I love most\nabout Lego Star\nWars? You know\nexactly what is\ngoing to happen\nwhen you push the start button.\nYou\u2019re going to be playing a game\nbased on the Star Wars franchise.\nAnd it\u2019s going to be constructed\nwith Lego bits. It\u2019s Lego... but in\nSpace!\nAnd that\u2019s what Lego Star Wars\nis. Not Lego in Space \u2013 although,\nof course, it\u2019s that too. What\u2019s more\nimportant though is that it\u2019s simple.\nIt\u2019s the most basic good versus bad\nstory ever married with the most\nbasic block building toy ever. And\nsimple is good. Simple is always\ngood.\nSuperb graphics \u2013 second in\nAndrew\u2019s list after the jokes which,\ndespite not quite being of the giddy\nintellectual level of BBC Three \u2013 or,\nsay, The Beano \u2013 are pitched perfectly to the light-hearted feel of the\ngame in general.\nBut the graphics. They\u2019re not\nFarCry in their scope, nor UT 2007\nin their detail, but they\u2019re Lego.\nThey\u2019re sharp, they\u2019re bright, and\nthey crucially never get in the way\nof the gameplay. Kids don\u2019t want atmosphere so thick that you can\u2019t tell\nwhat\u2019s the player and what\u2019s just a\nbig area of shadow. They just want\nto kill stuff with lightsabers.\nAt the Game On exhibition, currently showing at the Science Musteum, the older games are more\nimmediately attractive than the\nnewer ones, for me. It\u2019s not because there\u2019s something satisfying-ly snobbish about refusing to play\nany game that has more than two\ndimensions \u2013 it\u2019s simply because\nyou only need to look at Space Invaders to \u2018get\u2019 the entire game. It\nhas a feeling.\nLego Star Wars 2 has a feeling.\nEvery level \u2013 whether it\u2019s bombing\naround the desert town of Mos Eisley or trying to work out what\u2019s going on in the Battle Of Hoth \u2013 flows\nfrom one section to another without\nfeeling too restrictive.\nIf you\u2019re expecting non-linearity,\nthough, this is the planet where you\nget off, because Lego Star Wars 2\nis the complete opposite. In fact,\nif you expect anything less than a\nrun-through of the titular Original\nTrilogy of films, you\u2019re going to be\nmore disappointed than the last\nStormtrooper to be picked for the\nannual hoverball match.\nBut again \u2013 that\u2019s why the game\nworks. There are no complications\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t the droids you are looking for. Move along.\u201d\nPlay Again?\nDespite the increase in availability\nof purely child-audience games\nfor PC and handhelds, they all\nseem to be pretty rubbish rip-offs\nof each other, or of \u2018classic\u2019 titles\n(such as Mario). Children may be\neasily entertained at first, but the\nshallowness of these games soon\nshows through and they are soon\ntossed aside. Taking the recent\nFinding Nemo game for GBA as\nan example, it is just a clone of a\nmaze-based game from yesteryear,\nwith exceedingly similar \u2018puzzles\u2019\nand small changes to surroundings\nas the game progresses.\nHowever, is that not what all\n(single player) gaming is? FarCry;\na recent hit PC game is basically\n(read: cynically) a clone of Doom,\nwith islands and hired grunts\ninstead of the walls and zombies?\nThis may be an over simplification\nas there are differences, such as\nmuch better graphics & physics,\njeeps & boats as well as the AI\nplayers you fight with, but the general gist is the same: shoot guys\nand run.\nNew, inventive, games and game\ntypes are needed to stimulate the\nkids\u2019 games market if it wants to\nimprove the quality of it\u2019s output,\nand make the parents want to\nplay the game as well (as many\n\u2018children\u2019s books\u2019 such as Harry\nPotter and His Dark Materials\nhave done). The game design\n(quality of writing) will be what\npulls the parents in and hooks the\nchildren, not the characters and\nbig names which is the major force\ncurrently. Detractors of computer\ngames may brandish even these\nchildren\u2019s games as BAD AND\nEVIL, harming children\u2019s health.\nThe initiative therefore lies with\nthe hardware makers to ensure\ntheir point is null, as with the\nNintendo Wii where physical movement is encouraged, nay, required,\nto do well.\nLook familiar? There\u2019s a reason\nEverything aside, children\u2019s\ngames will still get lots of sales\nbecause children want everything\nand anything to do with a certain\nshow/movie/toy, so even if it only\ngives a little bit of entertainment,\ndoes quality really matter to the\nchild?; probably not. The parent\nhowever will probably be frustrated that the toy (as with all toys) is\nnever touched after a month.\nJames Skuse\nonce you take up your lightsaber\nand step into the robes or fur of the\nfranchise\u2019s finest \u2013 you\u2019re here to\nplay pretend, and nothing else.\nIt\u2019s interesting to consider what\nkids games really are. When you\nlook at Lego Star Wars 2 \u2013 rated 3+\nby the powers that be \u2013 you think\nthat it\u2019s just blocky fun with no bad\nendings. You still respawn every\ntime you die, and there\u2019s no blood.\nBut you can pull bits off people.\nIt\u2019s funny when you first see it,\nand it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going\nto give the average schoolkid nightmares given that any Lego-based\nexperience tends to involve pulling\nheads and legs off hapless yellow\nmen, but the fact that the kids notice it at all says something.\nI think it\u2019s often too easy to make\nassumptions about young gamers\nthat are completely wrong. Just as\nI\u2019m far too scared to ever play past\nthe first ten minutes of Silent Hill,\nsomeone half my age knows what\nthey like and what they don\u2019t like.\nThey don\u2019t need to be pandered to.\nThey just need designers to think\nabout what\u2019s actually fun.\nAnd he\u2019s got a good point. Lego\nStar Wars 2 isn\u2019t the result of pandering to anyone \u2013 the game\u2019s just\nas fun for me to play as it is for any\nother self-respecting gamer. But it\u2019s\nnot quite as good as the original.\nWhy? Because it\u2019s more Star Wars\nand less Lego. And to put a finer\npoint on it \u2013 it\u2019s more Lego Star\nWars and less pure fun injected into\nyour eyeballs.\nIt\u2019s still a laugh with an extra player \u2013 dropping in and out of any mis-sion, and lightsabering your best\nmate to bits \u2013 and unlocking the copious characters is something that\nkeeps you interested. But it feels\nlike they\u2019re trying too hard. You\ncan\u2019t force fun \u2013 it just happens.\nForce. Anyone?\nNo, we can\u2019t bear to look either\n18 felix Friday 24 November 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Tony Blair has burst onto the science stage, campaigning for a\ngreater prominence in today\u2019s\nsociety.\nThe Prime Minister delivered a\nspeech to the Royal Society in Oxford, and gave an interview to New\nScientist magazine on the subject.\nSir Richard Sykes, Rector of Imperial College, wrote a paper for the\nPrime Minister to prepare on the\nsubject.\nThe move came as a decline in\nthe number of science students became evident. Tony Blair said: \u201cWe\nneed our young people today to embrace science enthusiastically, to\nrealise that challenges like climate\nchange can only be beaten by motivated and dedicated scientists, and\nto understand that a career in science today is not a life all spent in\na laboratory but has the best business and job prospects the modern world can offer. Science today\nabounds both with noble causes\nand with glittering prizes: reach out\nfor them.\n\u201cWe need our scientists today to\nbe as celebrated and famous as our\nsportsmen and women, our actors,\nour business entrepreneurs. Scientists are stars too. This is Britain\u2019s\npath to the future, lit by the brilliant\nlight of science.\u201d\nTo follow up the Prime Minister\u2019s\ncomments, Felix spoke to Professor Lord Robert Winston, the celebrated fertilisation expert. Prof.\nWinston said that the problem facing science in modern society was\ncultural, and that scientists should\n\u201cstop talking about science and the\neconomy\u201d, he also said: \u201cScientists\ncome across as being dry, cold and\nunethical, and that is our fault.\u201d\nHe drew attention to the fact that\nscientists are sometimes perceived\nas being arrogant and speaking\ndown to people. This view point is\nalso held by Mrs. Justine Jones,\nan expert on public speaking who\nworks with Imperial\u2019s Maths stu-dents, she said: \u201cWhen communicating love of science in Maths,\nremember it is your challenge to\nmake the people you\u2019re speaking to\nfeel smart.\u201d\nProf. Winston noted that it was\nnot \u2018cool\u2019 to know about science,\nthat for many people the social\nstandard when it came to science\nwas to claim \u2018I don\u2019t know anything\nabout that.\u2019\nYour reporter took up the challenge of putting this opinion to the\ntest. He asked many people what\nthey knew about maths, the vast\nmajority responded by saying that\nthey \u2018don\u2019t know about that\u2019. By\ncomparison, very few claimed to\nknow nothing about music or film,\nand not one claimed to be illiterate.\nSo how is this issue being ad-dressed? Oneschemethathasbeen\nparticularly successful is \u2018Maths\nMatters\u2019, based at the Maths department at Imperial College. Under the scheme students work with\nMaths department staff, Exscitec,\nwho also work with the Pimlico\nConnection, and public speaking\nexpert Justine Jones to prepare exciting presentations based on their\nown mathematical studies. The\npresentations aim to inspire pupils\nby showing how mathematics is key\nto many developments in society at\nlarge, and are delivered to school\npupils around London. The presentations are often politically rel-evant, for example, one presentation last year showed how maths is\nused in disease modelling, and was\ndelivered at the time of the Bird Flu\nscare.\nThe scheme has received 100%\npositive feedback, and students\nhad to be protected by the college\nfrom demand by schools that could\npotentially have damaged their\nstudies.\nKam Cheng was a member of the\n\u2018Sexy Maths\u2019 team, the precursor\nto Maths Matters and has stayed\nwith the scheme, now helping a\nnew generation of presenters. He\nrecalls how cauliflowers were the\nunlikely link between sexy and\nmaths: \u201cWith the help of a brilliant\nspeaking coach who also advised\non how to capture the audiences\u2019\nimagination, my group was able to\ncreate a presentation that involved\nPowerpoint slides, visual aids and\ninteractive props, thus covering all\nthe bases when it comes to teaching a new concept and making sure\nit sticks.\n\u201cThe first school my group were\ninvited to was a Catholic faith secondary school. The kids were very\nwell behaved and were braver than\nwe had planned for; every time we\nneeded a volunteer from audience,\nmany hands would be raised (al-though the lure of chocolates as a\nreward always helps, I guess!) Even\nhanding out bits of cauliflower (yes,\na cauliflower) for the kids to peruse\nover did not result in mayhem or\ndestruction. In fact, they were fascinated by how maths could be applied to the real world; at the end we\nwere asked questions ranging from\n\u2018What is the food like at university?\u2019\n(Clearly inspired by the sight of\nthe cauliflower), to whether people\nused maths in to solve crimes, like\nin a TV series.\u201d\nKam went on to speak at other schools including inner city\nschools, the pupils of which he describes as who he describes as \u201cthe\nkids we were aiming to encourage;\nthose that may not have thought\nabout further study, let alone further study in maths.\u201d He also said:\n\u201cUsing props not only brings to life\nwhat numbers cannot, but also it\nprovides a chance for interaction\nwith the audience, something essential when you are dealing with\nan audience who have a short attentions span.\u201d\nViki Howse, a colleague of Kam\u2019s,\nsaid that she had gained confidence,\npublic speaking skills, and learnt\nhow to explain complex problems\nto people with less experience on\nthe subject, she also added: \u201cWe\nencourage to kids to continue studies in science and maths\u2026 We\u2019re\nanswering the questions that teachers hate.\u201d\nOne of the main enabling factors\nin this success has been the level of\nsupport provided. Professor Darryl\nHolm of Imperial College\u2019s Maths\ndepartment first thought of the idea\nwhen Sir Richard Sykes called for\noutreach programme involvement\nin 2005. Prof. Holm said: \u201cAn e-mail\nwent round asking for volunteers to\ntake part in outreach programmes,\nbut the suggestions were along the\nlines a soccer league or a charity\nsale.\n\u201cJustine and I had just helped a\nbunch of 2nd year students with a\npresentation they were giving on\nmathematics. They improved so\nmuch, and so quickly. I just thought\nthat there were all these students\nmaking very good presentations for\ntheir course that would just sit on\nthe shelf once they got their marks.\n\u201cWhy not come up with a programme that involved academics\ndoing what they actually do?\u201d\nThe idea was further developed\nby Minna Ruohonen of IC Volunteer\nCentre who helped turn the idea\ninto practice by providing contacts\nwith external training, CRB checks\nand funding.\nFelix asked Justine Jones what\nsort of person should get involved,\nshe said: \u201cNo experience is neces-sary; you don\u2019t even need to be confident because it\u2019s a learning proc-ess. Whoever you are when you\nwalk in, we\u2019ll teach you how to give\npresentations and you\u2019ll walk out a\nconfident public speaker. The one\nthing you do need is commitment.\u201d\nAlan West of Exscitec, who also\nworks with the Pimlico Connection,\nenabled training and contact with\nschools. Students became Science\nand Engineering Ambassadors and\nreceived training in presentation\nskills over the course of a couple of\nmonths.\nA further indication to the remarkable success of the team came\nwhen they were asked to speak to\nthe Lighthill Institute of Mathematical Science (LIMS) and the London Mathematics Centre (LMC)\nin March 2006, after a meeting between Prof. Holm and Professor\nLord Julian Hunt, who was then Director of LIMS. The students were\nalso asked to take part in \u2018think tank\u2019\nsessions at the conference that\naimed to bring together university\nstudents and lecturers and school\npupils and teachers. The objective\nwas to \u201cBridge the gap at the school\nuniversity interface.\u201d Ideas generated have been shared between institutions in London and there are\nplans for an annual joint event with\nLIMS and LMC addressing the is-sue. Teresa Smart, Project Manager for LMC and Imperial alumni\nsaid: \u201cThe conference was very\nsuccessful, both sides opened balanced dialogue\u2026 [The conference]\nis something people still remember\nand that gets them speaking.\u201d\nThe event was co-organised by\nProfessor Celia Hoyles OBE, the\nChief Adviser for Mathematics at\nthe Department for Skills and Education (DfES) installed by Charles\nClarke in 2004.\nProf. Hunt expressed a desire to\nspeak to Felix on the issue, but unfortunately is occupied in the US.\nHe did point out that there is now\na similar scheme to Maths Matters\nrunning at UCL.\nDr. Lynda White and Dr. Frank\nBerkshire of Maths department\nare a particularly innovative pair,\norganising undergraduate studies\nat Imperial\u2019s Maths department.\nHaving set up a pioneering course\nunit where undergraduates deliver\nprojects and presentations a few\nyears ago, which would eventually\nprovide the material for Maths Matters and later securing funding for\nMaths Matters. A new idea being\nputtogetherbythemwithDr.Emma\nMcCoy, also of the Maths depart-ment, is to send undergraduates\nto schools around London to teach\npupils as part of their undergraduate degree. The scheme is only in\npreliminary planning, but has received a high amount of interest\nfrom undergraduate students. Dr.\nWhite said that if the course were to\ngo ahead, admission to the course\nwould be limited and an interview\nprocess would be necessary.\nScience today is facing a problem;\nthat much is clear. The problem is\nin the very culture of scientists who\ntalk down to those they do not consider to be as enlightened as them.\nA lack of communication skills, or\nperhaps a lack of will to communi-cate, that leaves the general public\nin the dark over developments in\nthis area of our culture. Apparently\nscience needs to realise its place\nas another part of culture just as\narts such as music, film and theatre are.\nFelix asked Prof. Winston what\nadvice he would give to students\nwanting to be involved in reintegrat-ing science into modern culture, he\nsaid: \u201cGo to the theatre, read lit-erature, play a musical instrument,\nhumanities are very important, try\nto realise it\u2019s not wrong to do these\nthings, in fact it\u2019s right.\u201d The advice raises an important point. Scientists cannot afford to segregate\nthemselves from modern culture in\nthe pursuit of science.\nOn the other hand, it is also apparent that there is a whole community of very talented individuals\nworking to resolve the issue. Some\nof these individuals are at Imperial\nCollege, and they provide the opportunity to students here to succeed in winning round future generations to the science as a part of\nculture. Others are doing the same\nat their various universities and in-stitutions, and all are open to sharing ideas and discussion.\nImperial answers Blair\u2019s campaign\nAs Science awakens to the need to reintegrate with society, Imperial takes leading outreach initiatives\nDavid Ellis\nNews Editor\nLeft to right: Rohit Biyani, Gareth Williams and Abdulaziz Mohamed practise their Maths presentation\nLeft to roght: Min Jung Son, Sharmishtha Roy and Mohammad\nAkhtar wrote the script for their presentation on Random Mechanics\n3\nfelix\nFriday 24 November 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Men\u2019s Rugby\nBucks Chilterns 1st XI 11\nICURFC 1st XI 17\nRugby 1sts triumph over Bucks 1sts\nAlexander Johnstone\n27\nfelix\nFriday 24 November 2006\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAfter the previous week\u2019s poor performance against South Bank, the\nteam were anxious to improve and\nprove the true ability of the squad.\nSimilarly to last week, Imperial\ncame out all guns blazing to score\nan early try through, fresher, Dan.\nFletcher couldn\u2019t quite make\nthe kick, but it seemed like Imperial meant business. Unfortunately,\nfrom the restart the Bucks side\ntackled strongly and, with some\nimpressive counter rucking, turned\nover a lot of balls they shouldn\u2019t\nhave been allowed. Their efforts\nwere soon rewarded a couple of\nminutes later, when they slotted a\npenalty in front of the posts.\nWith the backs trading kicks, after the restart, it fell to Rob Phillips to make some good penetrative\nruns, feeding both wings to make\nsome much needed yardage. However well the backs were playing,\nthe forwards just weren\u2019t providing\nan adequate platform for them to\nplay off. The lineout was uncharacteristically poor, with both wayward\nthrowing and static jumping, the\nBucks team deservedly took possession of the ball.\nIt became increasingly difficult\nfor the backs to do much with the\nball as the team was constantly\npinned in our own half. The larger\nBucks pack was making it hard to\nwin any set piece and it was inevitable that eventually we would concede another score. It came from a\nscrappy passage of play with some\nvery poor first tackles from both\nthe Imperial forwards and backs.\nEventually Bucks found the space\nto move the ball out wide. The\nonly consolation from this score\nbeing that the forwards had held\nout against numerous attempts at\ncatch and drives; something that\nhad been worked on extensively\nduring Monday\u2019s training.\nWith 25 minutes gone, team coach,\nJoycey drew on his international\nexperience (Swedish ladies) to take\nthe decision to make the back row\nmore dynamic. With the departure\nof Flannan (noticeably unfit and a\nlittle overweight) it fell to fresher\nJames Petit to bare the burden of\nthe no. 7 shirt.\nThe second half closed itself out\nwith the departure of fresher and\nteam mullet Dan sustaining a suspected dislocated-relocated ankle.\nDan, in noticeable pain, decided to\ntry and walk off from one side of\nthe pitch to the other slowing up\nproceedings, but giving the Imperial forwards a much needed water\nbreak. His replacement, Tom Carroll, seemed eager and ready for his\nsecond 1st team appearance.\nThe second half started similarly\nto the first with Imperial building\n3 or 4 good phases before fresher\nJames Audford cut through the\ncentres to score a confidence boosting try. The kick was missed, leaving the score at 10-8 in IC\u2019s favour.\nSomething stirred within the\nBucks team, and they really began\nto make their weight advantage\npay, taking scrums and line outs\nat will. It became evident if Imperial were not prepared to man-up in\ntheir tackling, it would be costly and\nthe game would be lost.\nAfter sustained pressure and numerous catch and drives the Bucks\nteam were close to the Imperial\nline, some strong defending (only\nnear our try line) prevented a try.\nSpecial mention should go to Andjit\nwho managed to hold up one or two\ntry attempts.\nBucks were eventually rewarded\nfor their efforts and a cheap penalty in front of the posts gave them\n3 more points; letting them nudge\ninto the lead 11-10. It was as if the\nfight was out of Imperial as Bucks\nreinstated their physical superiority and had us pinned back in our\nhalf. But for a massive let off, where\none of the Bucks players dropped\nthe ball as he attempted to put\nit down over the line, the match\nwould surely have been taken out\nof contention. Only then did Imperial realise the embarrassment that\nwould ensue if they were to be beaten by a side that boasted course titles such as \u201cInternational football\nmanagement\u201d.\nAs the half started to close out,\nNathan a.k.a the second heaviest man in the squad (after Jov)\nwas brought on in the centres for\nFletcher. He made an immediate\nimpact both in the tackle and contact area. Luke Taylor replaced\nOwen in the front row and gave the\nsrum some much needed stabil-ity. With slightly better platform,\nand the Bucks heavies starting to\ntire, the team started to play some\nbetter rugby. Fresher Joeseph\nmy balls-are-more-golden-thanFletcher\u2019s Brown made a fantastic\ncharge down in the Bucks 22, only\nto be blinded by his own hair covering his eyes. The look of surprise\non his face, as he somehow caught\nthe ball and attempted to scramble for the line, was only matched\nby Nathan\u2019s look of disgust as Joe\ndelayed the off load until he had\nmanaged to trip himself up. Luckily\nNathan managed to hold onto the\npass and crash over the line; for his\ntroubles some Bucks players felt it\ncompulsory to jump on him. With\nminutes to go Imperial typically\ntook our collective feet off the gas,\nconceding territory to Bucks and\nfinding ourselves yet again fighting\nat our try line. With Bucks needing\na converted try, a lineout wasn\u2019t an\noption, so after gaining a penalty\nopted for the scrummage. Finally\nthe pack turned up and a good\nshove gave Luke Taylor the opportunity to cheekily kick the ball out\nthe scrum, the scrappy play that\nproceeded resulted in a knock on by\nBucks. The ref saw this a suitable\nmoment to end the game. Imperial,\njust the victors at 17-11, have a lot of\nwork to do if we expect to hold our\nposition in the league. Andjit was\nthe only player to work hard in all\nareas, thoroughly deserved his second man of the match this season.\nKing\u2019s Medicals enjoy a good bashing from IC\nMen\u2019s Football\nGKT Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nIC Men\u2019s 5th 3\nWith four games of the season gone,\nIC\u2019s favourite football team stood\nat a cross-road. Played four; won\n2, lost 2. The result of this match\nwould determine whether 5ths had\nwon 3 and lost 2 or vice versa, which\nmeant that it was literally a quite\nimportant game. The opposition before us \u2013 GKT 2\u2019s \u2013 had demolished\nIC\u2019s 4th\nteam 8-1 the previous week,\nand even though we all know that\nthe fourth team aren\u2019t really up to\nmuch (3-0, 3-2 \u2013 James Skeen, Paul\nNotshark, Mike Pursey: your boys\ntook one hell of a beating; twice)\nit was with a degree of trepidation\nthat we approached this game.\nThe first 20 minutes went as predicted \u2013 GKT\u2019s classy team ripping\nthe 5th\n\u2019s apart. I think goalkeeper\nGAAARRRRYYY put it best when\nhe said \u201cer, lads, they\u2019re having too\nmany shots\u2026\u201d Desperate defending seemed to be the order of the\nday, as GAAARRRRYYY kept us in\nthe game with a string of fine saves\n\u2013 including a full length dive to tip a\nfree kick around the post.\nWith the score (somehow) still at\n0 -0 after half an hour; captain Gui\nmade a surprise tactical change\nworthy of Claudio Ranieri himself.\nRemoving the very impressive Sam\nand Chris from a narrow midfield\nand bringing on himself and Umut,\nand switching from a 4-1-3-2 formation to a traditional 4-4-2 had an immediate impact as Gui scored with\nhis first touch after a great through\nball by \u201cClassy\u201d Matty Smith.\nIt was completely against the run\nof play but never mind \u2013 IC were in\nfront!\nAn ordinary football team might\nhave attempted to cling on until\nhalf time; but IC 5th\n\u2019s are no ordinary football team. Allowing GKT\nto pressurise us further, we again\nhit them on the break as the ball\nbroke to Matty in the area and he\nwon a strong 50-50 challenge with\nthe keeper before rolling the ball\ninto an unguarded net \u2013 2-0 IC at\nhalf-time.\nIC\u2019s inspirational half time\nteam talk from QPR\u2019s \u201cRobbo\u201d\nhelped to bring GKT back into the\ngame as literally seconds after\nthe interval the otherwise flawless GAAARRRRYYY\u2019s hesitation\nturned a seemingly innocuous long\nball into a pin point pass to leave\nthe GKT striker to roll the ball into\nan empty net.\nGame on. At this point the game\ncould really have got away from IC;\nbut luckily James \u201cLong\u201d ran onto\na \u201clong\u201d ball almost immediately after the GKT goal, and made no mistake to slot the ball past the keeper\nwith a quite \u201clong\u201d shot. After this\n(metaphorical) hammer blow, GKT\nbegan to lose their shape and discipline and IC looked the most likely\nscorers for the remainder of the\ngame.\nA combination of Scott \u201cThe self-proclaimed Animal\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s\nincredible sliding challenge, \u201cCitizen Snipps\u201d Ed Lobb\u2019s amazing\ngoal line clearance and excellent\nlinesmanship from Sam \u201cno nickname\u201d Styles ensured that IC held\non for a famous 3-1 win.\nAn excellent display all round,\nbut special praise goes to the back\n5; GAAARRRRYYY, Scott, Toby,\nSnipps and Graham who coped\nexcellently with a quick and skilful\nGKT side.\nImperial set up for another mouvement general attack against a bewildered opponent; the ref looks on, bemused and slightly off balance\nImperial footballers employing disgusting diversionary tactics\nSam Styles\n\n"

    "content": "A psychotic death cult?\nL\nast week Samuel Lynas\nshared his thoughts on\nMuslim military conduct\nduring the fall of Constantinople, the subject of an\narticle on Imperial\u2019s Islamic Society\n(ISoc) website. Unfortunately, his\naccount of this historic event is both\nmisleading and misinformed. Predictably, his conclusion \u2013 ISoc celebrates barbaric \u2018unprovoked Muslim conquests\u2019 \u2013 suffers accordingly.\nMuslims agree that war is not good\nper se but nonetheless maintain that\nit can, at times, yield a greater good\nfor humanity: such was the understanding of Sultan Mehmet II.\nThe siege of Constantinople was\nnot, as was suggested, an unprovoked imperial raid, but can be justified by the standards even of \u2018decent\npeople\u2019 today. The Byzantine Empire had actively encouraged and\nfacilitated Crusaders in their crimes\nagainst the peoples of the Levant,\nindiscriminately slaughtering not\nonly Muslims, but Jews and other\nChristians as well. The capture of\nits capital created a buffer zone between the Anatolian plate and mainland Europe, thereby ensuring the\nsafety of its citizens. In addition, the\nByzantine emperors were oppressing their own subjects, over-taxing\nthe poor and persecuting religious\nminorities. It would have been a crying shame indeed for any authority\nto stand by in face of such atrocities.\nHistory demanded intervention.\nThis, evidently, was also the view\nof contemporary Europeans: not a\nsingle European nation, leader or\nSaad Raja responds to \u201cIslam, Violence and the empires\u201d (Felix 1364, 17 November)\nauthority assisted the Byzantine\nruler during the siege of his capital.\nTheir silence here was not a protest\nagainst foreign invasion, but consent\nto the arrival of a much-welcomed\nforce.\nLynas described the blood bath\nthat the invading army made of\nConstantinople\u2019s citizens with the\naccompanying \u2018rape, pillage and enslavement of the defeated peoples\u2019.\nHow could a prophesized Muslim\narmy behave in such an inhumane\nmanner? The short answer is that\nthey didn\u2019t. Lynas seems to have\nbased his gory account solely on the\nuncritical adoption of Steven Runciman\u2019s \u2018The Fall of Constantinople\n1453\u2019, a book which has little, if any,\nacademic authority in the field of\nOttoman history. Not only does this\nauthor lack command of the Ottoman-Turkish language (a pre-req-uisite for access to reliable archival\nmaterial) but his work is poorly referenced with sources that are false,\nbiased or out-of-date. Had Lynas\nmade reference to established\nscholars of Ottoman Studies, like\nStanford J. Shaw and Halil Inalcik,\nthe story of the conquest would have\nbeen dramatically different and far\ncloser to the truth than Runciman\u2019s\npolitically motivated description.\nFor example, in contrast to Runciman\u2019s portrayal that the Muslim\ninvaders \u2018slew everyone that they\nmet in the streets, men, women\nand children without discrimination\u2019, Stanford Shaw in his \u2018History\nof the Ottoman Empire\u2019 informs us\nthat \u2018Mehmet kept his troops under\nH\naving already bored\nthe pants off anyone\nwho\u2019s tried reading\nfelix over the past\nfortnight, let\u2019s all be\ngrateful that this whole \u2018NUS referendum\u2019 bollocks, er I mean debate\nis finally over and done with. Perhaps now I\u2019ll be able to walk down\nthe walkway without being accosted by someone wearing a monkey\noutfit and an nus t-shirt trying to\ntell me how to vote. Anyway whilst\nploughing through some of the garbage written in felix by some socalled campaigners \u2013 most of whom\nappear to have never written more\nthan two consecutive sentences\nbefore, I was struck by a couple of\nquotes from some Very Important\nand Distinguished People. For instance I was somewhat perturbed\nto see Gemma Tumelty, NUS President, exclaiming to us \u201cYou are not\nmy member\u201d \u2013 well thank god for\nthat, or else her picture would have\nbeen pretty misleading.\nPerhaps more shocking however\nwas the statement written by the\nRt. Hon. John Collins that \u201cWe could\nspend our newly acquired \u00a379,000\non beer but\u2026 I would suggest that\nis not a mature or inclusive way\nof allocating iCU\u2019s resources\u201d\u2026\nwhat? Come again? Not mature or\ninclusive? What could possibly be\nmore socially inclusive than having\na successful, thriving social scene\ncentred around a popular and well-frequented union bar? A bar which\nstudents flock to for a quick ploughman\u2019s and orange juice at lunch, a\ncouple of beers in the evening to discuss the day\u2019s equations and finally\na great night out accompanied by a\nfew snakebites on a Friday night. A\nbar renowned for its friendly and\nexciting atmosphere! Yes, in case\nanyone hadn\u2019t noticed, the above\nis a picture of a typical university\nstudent bar, replicated many times\nthroughout the country, and which\nwe sadly don\u2019t have a great copy of.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I don\u2019t think\nthe union bars are bad as such, despite the best efforts of last year\u2019s\nsabbs to turn DaVinci\u2019s into a clinic,\nthoughtfully ripping out the carpet\nand replacing it with grey plastic\n\u2013 however not many people would\nargue that the affirmation that it\u2019s\ncertainly not as good as it could be,\nor even as good as any other London union bar \u2013 why? Because not\nenough people go there. How can\nyou make more people go there?\nCheaper drinks, its as simple as\nthat. The union bar is surely a vital\nservice which the union provides us\nstudents rather than a way to milk\nus out of our precious little cash\nso they can throw it all at clubs &\nsocieties.\nOn the other hand charging students \u00a32.05 for a Grolsch or \u00a33 for\nan Old Rosie, in a bar supposed to\nbe run for students by students, and\nthen expecting people to flock to it\nis madness, unless you have a really nice set-up, like LSE or Kings,\nor at least a wider mix of people\nand genders than we do at Imperial. It is especially painful to have\nto shell out this much when the current Deputy President (Finances\n& Services) last year promised,\nif elected, to lower drinks prices.\nHe also stated immediately after\nhis election that he would seek to\n\u201ccorrect the unacceptable increase\nin bar and events prices\u201d. Well, either due to convenience or sheer\nincompetence, it seems the very\nsame man has overseen a situation\nwhere we\u2019ve come back to find that\nprices have actually gone up since\nlast year \u2013 thanks Jon Matthews,\nwe\u2019re all really happy we voted for\nyou, and don\u2019t feel at all betrayed!\nOh well, on the plus side this should\nat least serve to expose the weakness of the union election system,\nin which the sabbs do not appear to\nbe held to account for anything they\npromise in their manifesto.\nStudent politicians: hang them all now!\nfirm control, killing only those Byzantines who actively resisted\u2019, i.e.\nsoldiers. The merciful entry of the\nOttomans was such that \u2018decrees\nwere issued guaranteeing protection of the lives and properties of all\ninhabitants, regardless of religion\u2019.\nSo welcomed was the Ottoman conquest of the city that \u2018Muslims, Armenians, Jews, Greeks, Slavs, and\nothers came from all parts of the\nempire. Many Jews were attracted\nfrom as far away as Western Europe,\nwhere they were being subjugated\nto a new wave of persecution at this\ntime\u2019. Why would all these people\ncome to the new Ottoman administrated Constantinople if conditions\nwere as bleak as Runciman had\ndescribed? Such was the religious\ntolerance of the Ottomans that \u2018the\nGreek clergy were exempted from\ntaxes and left in charge of Church\nadministration. The danger here\nis not in remembering worthy conquests like that of Constantinople,\nbut in writers \u2018unfamiliar with the\nhistory\u2019 misconstrue the evidence\nat hand and thereby portraying Islam as a \u2018psychotic death cult\u2019. The\nkey to overcoming such obstacles\nis to educate ourselves about what\nIslam actually teaches rather than\ntaking wholesale media misrepresentations like Lynas\u2019 article. (Eve-ryone is welcome attend ISoc events\nfor this purpose). This is why ISoc\nmust be encouraged in their efforts\nto highlight humanity\u2019s struggle\nagainst tyranny and not bow down to\nthe pressures of unqualified pseudo\nhistorians.\nSaad Raja\nChristopher\nThomas\nI\n\u2019m no authority on statis-tics, and even less aware of\ncurrent thinking on social\npsychology but when I became a warden a few years\nago, I had always imagined that a\nsample of 270 people would be a\nreasonable representation of the\ngraduate population. (OK, I know,\nits hardly scientific and it\u2019s really\na very small sample of the whole,\nbut 270 is a big number as far as\nI\u2019m concerned \u2013 especially when\nthey\u2019ve discovered absinthe\u2026) I\nhad tacitly assumed that one year\nwould be largely like the others. Of\ncourse, basing any assumptions on\nsuch weak statistical evidence is\nbound to produce some eye-open-ing conclusions: Did you know in\nmy time as warden, of the great\nfamily of Wilsonites I\u2019ve known,\nthere is likely to be at least one\nwho will serve time at Her Majesties Pleasure? Or that there are\nperhaps thirty who would admit to\nsupporting Manchester United. I\u2019m\nnot sure which is worse\u2026\nExperience has taught me only\none maxim: Every year is dif-ferent. Some years have been\nnoisy\u2013 which presents its own\nproblems but creates a fantastic\natmosphere. Other years have\nbeen highly competitive \u2013 both in\nthe conventional sporting sense\nand the social sense. Some years\nare quieter but no less sociable\nfor that. Even the use of the hall\nfacilities changes. Some years\nthe TV lounge is the centre of hall\nlife, other years it\u2019s the entrance\nfoyer. Sometimes it\u2019s the area just\noutside the hall \u2013 possibly to watch\nour exotic neighbours ply their\ntrade! Part of the whole Wilson\nexperience is the sheer variety of\nlife here: Minutes from the wealth\nof Hyde Park and Marylebone,\nyet yards away from the seedier\nside of life in Paddington, with its\nlargely vice based economy. Such\na refreshing change from the hermetically sealed sterility of South\nKensington and it environs!\nIt is impossible to say why there\nare these differences, but some\nthings stay the same. Throughout\nmy time, Wilson House has been\nblessed with hardworking seniors and dedicated wardens and I\nthank each and every one of them\nfor making Wilson House what it\nis today \u2013 a home for some of the\nbrightest, friendliest students I\u2019ve\never met.

    "content": "Remembering the Sudanese\nOn February 23rd 2003, a group\nknown as the Darfur Liberation\nFront took public credit for an attack on the Headquarters of the\nJebel Marra region in Sudan. This\nis regarded as the beginning of a\nconflict described by the outgoing\nUN co-ordinator in Sudan, Mukesh\nKapila, as the \u201cWorld\u2019s greatest\nhumanitarian disaster\u201d, but was\nmerely the side act at a time when\nthe Sudanese Government and\nthe international community were\nengaged in drawing the north African country\u2019s second civil war\nto a close at the \u2018Navaisha show\u2019\nnegotiations.\nThe area of Darfur has a population of around six million, of which\napproximately half are black African. The other half are ethnically\nArab, and form the ruling govern-ment. The cause of Sudanese internal conflict is generally attributed\nto ethnic divisions and control over\nvital natural resources as well as\nthe disparity in development between \u2018outer\u2019 regions such as Darfur and the wealthier \u2018Blue Nile\u2019\narea. One of the primary goals of\nthe black African rebels is to gain\ngreater ethnic representation in\nParliament and to have a Dafurian\nVice President.\nThe rest of 2003 saw the Sudan\nLiberation Army and the Justice\nand Equality Movement escalate\nattacks on Government of Sudan\nforces in the Darfur region. In April\nof that year, 33 Landrovers were\nused in an attack on an army garrison which claimed the lives of 75\nsoldiers and military personnel, the\ndestruction of several bomber units\nand the capture of 32 others, including a General. This unprecedented\nvictory by an increasingly unified\nrebel faction sparked a change in\nthe psychology and tactical approach pursued by the Government regarding the emerging cri-sis. With national troops positioned\nin the south to maintain peace at\nthe end of the civil war, and in the\neast protecting various important\ninfrastructure from other Eritrean\nsponsored rebels, the defence of\nthe western province of Darfur was\nthen delegated to a militia group\nknown as the Janjawid.\nThe Janjawid had first come to\nprominence in the suppression of\nsimilar uprisings in 1996-1999, also\nbacked by the government, only\nthis time they were better equipped\nand with more weapons, including\nartillery.\nWith a mandate to stop the insur-gency, the Arab paramilitary force\nproceeded to wage a technologically\none sided war which has grown into\nBush\u2019s Latest Visit\nU.S. President George W. Bush\nvisited Indonesia on Monday, the\nlast stop of an eight-day post-elec-tion Asia tour that included visits to\nSingapore and Vietnam. Bush held\ntalks with Indonesian President\nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono. He\nheaped praises on Indonesia, considered a key US key ally in the war\nagainst Islamic militancy.\n\u201cI admire your nation\u2019s diversity and its plurality. I admire your\npresident and his commitment to\nreform and strengthening democracy,\u201d Bush told them with Yudhoyono at his side. Amidst the visit,\nthousands of protesters ignored\nmonsoon rain and thunder to chant\nanti-Bush slogans. Some protestors\nheld banners that read \u201cBush is a\nterrorist!\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome\nhere!\u201d\nPresident Bush was unruffled\nand commenting on the protests\nsurrounding his visit, praised what\nhe said was a display of Indonesia\u2019s\ndemocracy. \u201cPeople protest, that\u2019s\na good sign,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of\na healthy society.\u201d\nAt the joint press conference, he\nsaid that he \u201capplauds a society\nwhere people are free to come express their opinion\u201d. He continued,\n\u201cIt\u2019s to Indonesia\u2019s credit that it\u2019s\na society where people are able to\nprotest and say what they think.\nAnd it\u2019s not the first time, by the\nway, where people have showed up\na humanitarian tragedy. The Janjawid have been accused of murder,\nloot, pillage, rape and mutilation.\nBy spring of 2004, over a million\npeople had been displaced fleeing\nthe violence with 100,000 crossing\ninto Chad, creating the worst refugee crisis of recent times. Virtually\nall of them were from the Fur, Massaleit or Zagawa tribes and none\nwere of Arabic origin, making the\nconflict appear racially motivated.\nThe current death toll as a direct\nresult of conflict today stands at\n200,000, and in May 2004, International Crisis Group estimated a\nfurther 350,000 people will die from\nstarvation and illness due to the remoteness of the Darfur region.\nUnited Nations Security Council\nResolution 1564, passed in October\nof 2004, set up an investigative unit\ninto Human Rights abuses in the\nregion. Resolution 1590 in March of\nthe next year acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and called\nfor the return of refugees to their\nhomes and more aid to get to the\naffected populations. After the Darfur Peace Agreement was signed\nin May 2006, the UN passed another Resolution, 1679, stating the\nneed for an accelerated UN peace\nkeeping plan, and called for 17,000\ntroops to replace the token and ineffective 7,000 strong African Union\nforce. Even on the day of signing,\nan attack involving 200 Janjawid on\ncamel back entered various villages killing civilians and destroying\nand looting property. The Sudanese\ngovernment maintains its opposition to a UN mission as a violation\nof sovereignty, and describes the\nsituation as an \u2018internal matter\u2019.\nThe international community is\nseen to have been reluctant to act\nin a full and forceful capacity to end\nthe crisis. Although the UN investigative team reported have \u2018mass\nkillings\u2019, the official term of \u2018genocide\u2019 was not attributed to the situa-tion. Genocide would have demanded action to be taken. Many argue\nthat the US interventions in Iraq\nand Afghanistan have prevented\nit from engaging in other conflicts\nsuch as Sudan. There is suggestion\nthat a possible veto by permanent\nSecurity Council member China\nmay have prevented a resolution\nimplementing a UN force because\nof economics interests in the area.\nSudan Liberation Army troops\nand Government of Sudan forces\nmay have, up until now, adhered\nto such ceasefire terms in the May\nAgreement, but the treaty has only\nlead to a more factitious and chaotic situation with those unhappy\nwith the terms continuing to fight\nunilaterally.\nThe last weekend saw a visit by\nUN humanitarian chief Jan Egeland to the affected areas, but his\ntrip was cut short due to Khartoum restrictions and increasing\nviolence.\nOn Wednesday 15th November,\nthe government of Sudan is reported to have launched major offensives in the north Darfur area,\nthough it denies this. Foreign journalists are now being denied visas.\nThere are still 2 million displaced\npersons in the western Sudanese\nprovince, unable to return because\nof continuing violence and lawless-ness. African Union troops are also\nunable to protect all the refugee\ncamps from Janjawid and Government of Sudan strikes.\nYou know what? It may only be my\nsecond week in the job but I\u2019ve decided to calm down for now; heck\nmaybe drop this column. I\u2019ve decided to follow the lead of the noble\nMatthew Taylor, Tony Blair\u2019s outgoing chief strategy advisor. This\nweek he commented that for all\nits achievements, the Internet was\nfuelling a \u201ccrisis\u201d in today\u2019s democ-racy. Mr. Taylor claims that blogs\nencourage \u201ccitizens to participate\nin a shrill discourse of demands\u201d\nrather then more reasoned debate.\n(Am I the only one worried by that\nphrase? Are the Labour party planning to send us off to an alien planet\nto fight big bugs to learn to be \u2018True\nCitizens\u2019? It scares the living piss\nout of me!). He also complained\nthat internet articles gave the impression that \u201cour leaders are out\nthere to shaft you\u201d.\nSo this week I\u2019m not going to be\ncock-eyed about politics. Instead,\nI\u2019ll be straight-faced. Who\u2019s a better example to learn from about\nreasoned argument that from our\ndear leaders themselves? Take\nthe loveable, happy, go-lucky guy\nDavid \u2018Dave\u2019 Cameron; who, in a response to the Queen\u2019s speech made\na drawn out and not at all immature attempt at humour with a joke\nwhere the punch line called the Labour government: \u201ca whiter shade\nof fail\u201d. I can feel my ribs breaking\nas I write. I tried to contact Davey\nafterwards to ask him to clarify his\nposition but he only replied with an\nInternet clip of himself riding on a\nbike, telling me that he\u2019s \u2018considering my letter which was very nice,\nincidentally!\u2019 (See? WebCameron\nis a perfect example of how leaders\ndiscuss policies fairly! The system\nworks!)\nIt was now time to contact Labour to discuss some of their fairer\npolicies; I had na\u00efve hopes that this\nwould work, considering the famous\npress conference last week when\nour dear leader, Tony Blair, showed\nan amazing example of leadership by squirming out of denouncing the death sentence of Saddam\nHussein (the evil scum-bag him-self. Altogether now \u2013 Boo!). Bear\nLearning from the leaders\nand expressed their opinion about\nmy policies.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what happens\nwhen you make hard decisions\u201d.\nAsked how he would comfort Muslims who fear that his policies target them, Bush replied: \u201cI believe\nfreedom is universal and democracy is universal, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s\nthe sole right of the United States,\nor the sole right of Methodists.\u201d\nThe US president added, somewhat ironically, \u201cI believe the vast\nmajority of people want to live in\nmoderation and not have extremists kill innocent people.\u201d\nWith security concerns para-mount, Bush stayed only about\nsix hours in Indonesia. After dinner with Yudhoyono, Bush set out\nfor Hawaii, where he was to have\nbreakfast with U.S. troops and visit\nthe U.S. Pacific Command.\nI\nthink that you will agree,\nthat there are often so many\ntradgedies in the world that\noccur in such frequency\nand quick succession, that\nwe do not ever do justice to each\nindividual one. A gift of charity\nor a passing thought are often\nall that can be given, and in the\ngrand scheme of things it is hardly\nenough from any one of us, even\nthough the act itself may be quite\nimpressive. If we remember these\nevents and resolve to do whatever\nis in our power to do, then perhaps\nwe can as a society, hope to truly\nhelp those in need.\nIf even the UN finds it difficult to\nmaintain peace in countries riddled\nwith war, then surely it is incumbent\non all of Humanity, each and ever\nsingle individual, to help in ways\nthat we can. Let\u2019s not be unrealistic,\nnot everyone can give up their day\njob, sell their house and move, but\nif we all collectively give the small\namount of time we all have spare to\nthe \u201cgood cause\u201d then that amount\nof effort is enough.\nNow what remains is to see that\nno external controls hold back a\ncountry\u2019s healing, which is usually\ndue to the actions of a neighbour\nor a far richer, developed power\nfurther away.\nOur effort must not be plagued\nby corrupt ineffectiveness.\nLi-Teck Lau\nAdil Hussein\nin mind that as signatories to the\nEU\u2019s Human Rights Act, the UK\nis committed to condemning the\nuse of the death penalty. When I\nsent an email confronting him on\nthis, I immediately got a reply from\nMandy@Newlabour.org.uk, which\nconsisted solely of a spinning picture of a vortex and the words \u201cThis\ndid not happen\u201d in large red font. I\nonly broke out of the spell by breaking the monitor with my fist. That\u2019s\n\u00a3300 you owe me, Labour.\nSo as you can see my adventures\nto engage with politicians on a\nstraight level has kinda fallen flat.\nBut nil desperandum, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll\nlearn to engage coherently in time\nand raise my debating standard to\nthat of our leaders!\nOmar Hashmi\nBush meets President Yudhoyono\nIs the WebCameron blog fueling a crisis in today\u2019s democracy?\nDisplaced Sudanese children\nOmar Hashmi\nPolitics Editor\n7\nfelix\nFriday 24 November 2006\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"
