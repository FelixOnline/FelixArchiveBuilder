    "content": "2 FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR LECTURERS TAPED\nSir Your account of Prof. Wiener's recent lecture on Cybernetics did not mention that the proceedings were preserved for posterity on a tape recorder an\nexcellent innovation, to be extended,we understand,to\nother important lectures. May we suggest that it would conform to the spi-rit of Prof. Wiener's thesis if you were to use your undoubted influence to persuade The Authorities( whom|\nGod preserve) to record some of the ordinary course\nlectures delivered in the College? To have these\nlectures played back to them could scarcely fail to have a most salutary effect on certain lecturer sand might enable others, whose repertoire is a Cons-'\ntant of Nature, to retire forthwith. The addition of recent material could be made by the already current device of speeding up the delivery of body of the lecture, and adding a series of coda eat the end.\nYours etc., A. VS. de Reuck.\nImperial College Hostel, Feb. 16th,1951 WHICH TURNING?\nSirI have- been asked to reply to your correspondent who requests that a sign board should be placed on \"waste ground\" opposite the Red Hon a tH arlington. At the beginning of this session an application was made to the local authority and also to the own-er of the garden at the end of Sipson Lane for perm is sion to erect suitable direction boards. The\nlocal authority would not grant permission and the owner of the garden at the end of Sips on Lane was\nnot in any way cooperative. The matter has been considered by the Athletic Ground Committee who felt that the difficulty would\nbe best met by having a large number of printed directions available in the Union so that Club secretaries could send these to visiting clubs. Yours faithfully, S.R. Sparkes,\nHon. Sec., Athletic Ground Committee.\nCity& Guilds Coll., Feb. 14th,1951 APRES MOI - LE DELUGE\nA II. le President.

COLLEGE MASCOT ?\nSir The Council of the Albert Hall recently wrote\nto Mr. Gaitskell, asking for a loan of \u00a3320,000,saying that their bank overdraft was \u00a3100,000, and pointing out that unless some aid was given soon, there might be no alternative but to close the hall. With a masterly grasp of essentials, Mr. Gaitskell J refused to lend the money, neatly blaming this off on\nto the new burden of increased defence expenditure. I congratulate the Chancellor and suggest that if the Hall is closed the Union should offer to buy\nit, for, say, \u00a31,000. It would make a good college mascot, being handy for odd occasions. For in stan ce, the president of the Mountaineering Club might\nbe required to make the ascent on the inside up to the dome top as proof of his prowess on the night of the Annual Dinner. Also it would come in handy for the Saturday Hops, providing more seats for begin n ers, more floor space for the intermediate couples, and more odd corners for the advanced couples. Moreover, so far as I know, no other college has an Albert Hall for its mascot.\nYours faithfully, 'Informer'.\nR.C.S.,5 th Feb. 1951\nTHE OUTSIDE WORLD\nSir In the last issue of FELIX there was a thought-provoking Combination of letters, two on the 'Paper\nUniversity' being printed alongside two on N.U.S. This is interesting because many of the arguments\nbrought forward in discussing the place of the individual London college in the framework of the University also apply to the place of that college and\nUniversity in the larger field of the N.U.S. If it is desirable that the colleges in London\ncombine for their mutual advantage^is it not also desirable that t he Universities of the country should\ncombine to the same end? To draw the line of coop-e ration at the boundary of Greater London is parochialism of a kind particularly virulent in London and\nis exceeded in shortsightedness only by the drawing\nof boundaries in Kensington Gore. The fact that there has been some rather strange behaviour on the\npart of the national executive does not alter the des ir ability for participation in the National Union.\nOn the contrary, it suggests that our representatives with their experience of self-government in student\naffairs could play an important part in the councils of the Union.\nThe essence of the matter is that if we are pre pared to cooperate with students outside our own college we must first strengthen our ties with the other London colleges but we should not forget that we have\nmuch to gain from cooperation with the other. Universities and colleges outside our own city. Yours etc., Louis Cohen,\nChem. Tech., 13th Feb., 1951\nBOUQUET\nFeb. 13th,1951. Sir May I propose a large bouquet ( or a\" pint on\nthe house\") to the very able artist who prepares\nyour numerous FELIX posters? Is he at liberty to illustrate theses and lab. report books?\nYours faithfully, Peter Howe, Chem. Tech.\nSOBERING THOUGHTS \"The Brewer*Society stated yesterday that the\noutput of beer during1950 was 25,167,508 bulk barr els;1,112,733 bulk barrels fewer than 1949.\nThe fall is one of more than 320 million pints.

C, CUP FINALISTS AGAIN Westminster Hospital0 Imperial College5 I.C. are again in the final, this being the third year in succession, and if they play as v; ell on\n.March 7 th as they did in the semifinal they stand an excellent chance of winning the cup for the second year running. The pitch was sticky after the rain, but in spite of the hard going the first half was played at a good pace made possible to a large extent by the s ecce s s ful passing and stick work of the whole\nteam. All five goals were scored in the first half( Een tley2, Purslow 2, Jones 1) and although the opp os it ion goal keeper was not strong, the movements\nwhich led to the actual shots were the result of good passing, good timing and quick decisions. There was more hard hitting and less construct ive work in the second half, when the pitch was rather the worse for wear, but the I.C. defence kept at it and did well to keep their opponents out of our goal entirely. There is some very good talent in the I.C. team\nand in this match it was evident at the right time\nand in the right place, and we hope it will all l re appear in the Final. Good luck, I. CI\nTeam: D. Hardy; R. Palmer, P. Just es en;.W.P ike, G. Bennett, S. Mossman; B. Purslow, R. Bent-,\nley, N. Jones, K. George, E. Green.\nSOCCER The weather of the last few months has resulted in many sports grounds disappearing in whole or part under the surface of the floods. H arlington inevitably succumbed and this has caused the postponement\nof numerous I.C. games together with the Technology\nCup match between Guilds and Mines which should have\nbeen played on 14-th Feb. At present a new date for this game has not been fixed. I. C.1st XI have played two matches, losing to St. Mary's College and beating Q.M. C. The 2nd XI, who have gained 11 points in11 league games to date, only had one match in Westminster College(42). I.C.3 rd XI lost two league games, - against Westmins ter Hospital(30) and St. Thomas's(21) and\nhave collected10 points from 12 league matches.\n1st Team: v.

The latter match was lost in the last tie by the narrowest possible margin!\nThe second team has been equally successful, in spite of the numerous players who have represented it at one time and another. It is regretted that one match\nhad to be cancelled owing to lack of support - this is the first occasion this has happened this season,\nand it is hoped it will not be allowed to occur again.\nA social fixture with I. C.W.. S.C.at the end of the Winter Term was enjoyed by all, though it clearly showed who were the dominant sex at Squash Rackets!\n(even against a handicap of three points and a hand).\nThe practise of the sweeping of the courts being\ncarried out by the Club captain( a traditional du-ty) - has lapsed. A member of the non-academic staff has been at last attracted by the princely wage off ered by the club there is however no hope, as yet, of anything being done about the seasonal shower bath\nIn court B. BOXING I.C.8 Kings Coll.3 In the gym on Tuesday, Feb. 13th, I.C. Boxing\nclub staged a number of bouts the majority of which\nwere between I.C. and Kings, although other colleges of the University were represented. The I.C. boxers\nacquitted themselves well as the score will show,and\nthe evening can be considered as being most success-ful.A certain military gentleman's sobriquet of\n'Blood and Guts' might well be applied to Philip Purse r(I.C.) who in his first fight representing I.C., displayed plenty of courage and a sanguinary\ncomplexion. That he lost toK. Mackerell (L.S.E.) is no disgrace* Few fights can, in all honesty,\nbe called beautiful, but Mike Humphreys (I.C.) gave\na display that really was a pleasure to watch, though W. Robinson ( Kings), his well matched opponent,\nmight disagree, having lost on points. Gaby Gales\n(I.C.) ultimately went down for good against the\nextremely rapid punches of J. Reavey ( Kings). after having repeatedly come up for more. Bill Cook\n( I.C.), another first timer, laid a hen's egg beneath the eye of C. Figg ( Kings), the doctor stop-ping the fight for fear it might hatch.\nThe most colourful fight of the evening was\nthat between Anton Brown (I.e.) and R. Gray(Kings).\nThis is the first time, as far as we know, that\nred has been obtained by mixing Brown and Gray.\nNext, Gordon Tait at7 st.12 lbs. ladled out his particular line in beauty treatment to J. Wilde\n(Kings) at9 st.7 lbs. The course of treatment\nwas concluded in t he first round. \" Killer\" Hulme lost on points to A. Dnjon ( Kings).

    "content": "FELIX\nVIEWPOINT\nThe Editor takes no responsibility for views\nexpressed in this column.\nCULTURE IK IC. 'Touchstone', 'Ends and Means', and now 'The\nUniversity of South Kensington' - culture is indeed\nin the air at I.C. these days. The latest PHOENIX\nis filled with articles exhorting us to leave our\ntechnological prisons to breathe deeply the refreshing air of liberal education, and extolling the efforts now being made to introduce the students of I.C. to the delights of culture. For everyone is agreed\nthat this aim is very laudable; in fact, the agreement is so unanimous that it might be as well to take a detached view of these efforts. 'Touchstone' is an attempt to induce students to discuss, sub j ect s outside the normal college curricula; how far it retraces ground already covered\nby the Literary and Debating, and Political Societies is a matter for speculation. Indeed it seems\nthat the majority of supporters of 'Touchstone' are\nstalwarts of these societies and it is difficult to see what beneficial effect it can possibly have on\nthe mass of Imperial College. The purpose of the\n'Ends and Means' lectures seems even more obscure;\none is led to believe that they were introduced so\nthat a head of a particular department could enlighten those studying other subjects on the nature. of his work and its relation to science in general. Recent lectures, however, may well have persuaded the\nunit i a ted to avoid the lecturer's subject at all cos ts; the organisers should remember that professors are not always appointed because of ability tod is cuss their own subject in public in an interesting manner. This series seems to me a classic example\nof well-meant futility. The latest and most fantastic suggestion is 'The University of South Kensington'. Briefly, the idea is that students of the Royal Colleges of Art, Music and Science should come into much closer cont act with one another than hitherto; this, it is claimed, will benefit not only the scientist but a lso the artist and musician,( for we all know how imp or tant it is that an opera singer should have a knowledge of the Second Law of Thermodynamics). Exa ct ly how this closer contact will be achieved has\nyet to be decided. The way regarded as obvious by\nall interested seems to be for the students to mix\ntogether, talk over coffee, hold joint functions etc. Yet if a lady from the R.C.M. who knows nothing of.\nscience is dancing with gentleman from the R.C.S. who\nknows nothing of music, the two things which they will not talk about will be music and science. If this is the way in which this project is to be tackled, it is doomed to failure fr on the start. What\nother way is there?At the meeting on Feb.5th, the RCS\nspeaker suggested lectures on aesthetics for stu dents of the R.C.S. and on philosophy and scientific method for students of the R.C.A. and. R.C.M. Could\nanything be more inept? As far as the R.C.S. is con-cern ed, the introduction of lectures on aesthetics would simply be a marvellous recipe for technical sausages. In fact, it Is quite evident that the\nwhole idea of this university can never be more than\na pleasant dream.\nHaving poured cold water on all the ' cultural' efforts' being made in I.C.,I can fairly be asked\nwhat I propose should be done instead. The answer\nis: nothing. The apathy towards culture at I.C. is too deep-rooted for any remedy to be effective. In stead of considering culture as a whole, let us look at the position of the arts in I.C. With the except ion of music, they might as well be nonexistent. A very important exhibition of Turner watercolours is on show at Agnew's. How many of I.C. will go to see it? A Swedish ballet company are presenting a most controversial ballet in London now. How many\nof I.C. will go to see it? Men ott i's dramatic opera\n'The Consul' is being given at the Cambridge Theatre, an event of great operatic importance. How many of\nI.C. will go to see it? You know the answers to th ese questions as well as I do - a negligible proportion in each case. The average student at I.C. has\nno interest in these sort0 of things. Yet if he\nwishes to enjoy the arts, or, more generally, culture, there is nothing whatever to prevent him. Equally, if he does not wish to enjoy culture, nothing whatever vr i. ll persuade him to make the attempt. Fatuous\nprojects such as 'Touchstone', 'Ends and Means' and\n'The University of South Kensington1 are just so much\nwaste of valuable time. J) \u00a3. \u00a3\nEVENTS\nFRIDAY, 23rd FEB.\nI.C.

    "content": "FELIX4 PROFILE\"/~ B\" GAI PARIS In the Mines we have a lecturer who tells us\nnot to take notes - it stops us listening to the\nlecture and still gets us successfully through\nthe exams. He is none other then J.B. Riohardson.\nJ.B. came to the R.S. M. as a student in1907 and even then was exceptional in that he did not\ncome from a mining, family. In fact, it seems he\nwas persuaded by a friend, L.P. Harding, to come\nhere because of a strong dislike of office work,\nand a strong desire to play rug ger. At that time the R.S. M. played fixtures such\nas would now make the I.C. team justifiably jealous. Consequently it was no mean achievement for Jack Richardson to be selected as left wing I, outs ide Harding.\nIn 1910 he received his Associate ship, and\nwent out to Nigeria with a\"t in farming\" concern,\naptly named Lucky Chance Mines. The country had\nonly recently been made a British protectorate, and was still the \"white man's grave\". When the\nparty of newcomers arrived in Nigeria they were\nmet by a government guide, a certain Mr. Finch, who, taking advantage of their in experience. foo led them into travelling heavily armed and postings en tried all night round their camps. This joke\nwas greatly appreciated by the old hands, who promptly nicknamed them \"Finch's Boy Scouts\".\nHowever the rest of J.B.' s work there was not\nso humorous. During one job his only European\ncompanion, also from the R.S. M., died of dys entry. But J.B. survived two years in West Africa, which\ngave him plenty of scope to practice his hobby-of\nsketching. An account of his journeys was pub-li shed in the Mining Magazine and the accompanying drawings prove him to be no mere amateur.\nIn 1912 he returned to England and married.\nHe and his wife then went out to a Bolivian tin mining company, for wh i oh he worked until the outbreak of the first World War.\nHe volunteered for the Army, and, after various engineering posts in Britain, was sent with the R.E.'s to France in'17. After the War J.B. went back to Bolivia, this time to an isolated mine in the Andes. While he\nwas there the natives went on strike and tried to\nassassinate the Europeans. For half a week, both\nday and night until support arrived, they had to\ndefend themselves with Mausers - this time it was\nnot a joke. After various jobs abroad he proved his versatility by changing to metallurgy(192428), but\nas he readily points out only so as to be with his wife and three children. Many students will feel sympathetic when they\nknow that J.B. once narrowly escaped being put in Jail. He was General Manager at San Telmo in Spain during the time of the Popular Front Government. One day a local tax collector arrived at\nhis office and started to be obstreperous. J.B. replied a little forcibly( Spanish can be such a picturesque language ) and was promptly charged\nwith \"Defamation of the State\". He managed to\ntalk his way out of being jailed, but it was a near\nthing. When the second World War came he was too old for the forces, so was put in charge of a Royal Ordnance Factory in Yorkshire. After the War he\nreturned to the R.S. M. as a lecturer, in Mining,\nand was elected as Old Students Represantative on\nCouncil. His son did not follow his father's prof es sion, but went to the Guilds instead. J.B. now hopes to have a grandchild at the R.C.S. to\neven things up.\nTOUCHSTONE\nLord Beveridge, at the time of his Social Insurance Report, divided the world into three classes: those who agreed with the Report; those who di sag reed with it; and those who had read it. The same\nclassification probably holds good for his recent enquiry into Broadcasting, and for the purpose of\nthe next Touchstone week-end it will be assumed that Those Who Have Read It will be in no danger of swamp ing the rest of the party. The date i a March 10/\n11th. Place:S il wood Park. Cost: 10/- ( in clu ding transport both ways). Subject: BROADCASTING,\nin both its technical and social aspects. The name\nof the opening speaker will be announced later. Make\na note of the date now if you would like to come;\nnames should be given in at the Union Office not la ter than2 nd March. The number of places is limited, but preference will be given to people who haven't been to a Touchstone week-end before. \"On Friday evening he took her to old Montmart re and they danced, with fairy lights twinkling down on them through the trees, with soft music in their ears, and wine . . . yes, the mystery and gaiety of Paris.\" Such was the theme of the latest carnival. A theme which provided the atmosphere of \"Gay Paris\" and indeed captured \" la vie fran e aise\" itself. The\natmosphere created was largely due to the truly magn if i cent decoration carried out in our well-worn\ngym. What is more Paris ien than an open air cafe, with its brightly coloured awning, its round tables, and its shaded lights? What could have been more\ncharacteristic than the newspaper stall, with its entertaining reading matter, and the . . . well, perhaps, if is convenient to forget that one! To\nDastid Allen must be attributed the idea, the scheme\nand the plans of this fairyland. He was definitely the midwife of the carnival. The confinement, howe ver, was a different matter, and here due recognition must be given to the cooperation and productivity of many Guildsmen. On the shoulders of Chief Administrator Marcus Hull rested the smooth running\nof the evening, His early nervousness, and tendency to flap were soon overcome, no doubt as a result of his militant uniform and his entertaining manner.\nFull marks to Marcus.\nThe Fancy Dress Parade came at the climax of .\nmuch eating and drinking and spirits could not have\nbeen higher. A special word of praise for Chien\nClive Newman, and n is Chienne. It has been said that in Paris the mannequin and the canine go hand\nin paw - Clive preferred paw in paw, and deservedly won the first prize. Cabaret turns are not easy to select for carnival audiences in the early hours, and, although\nLine Reyhaud and the Windmill girls would have been\ndesirable, the feminine charms of the mighty mannequin were well appreciated. Not only did she bend\nbars, and tear up 'phone directories, but also showed ready wit and repartee. The \" Skating Dexters\"\nrepeated their television show of the early evening\nand were thought to skate quite well. So passed the late hours . . . . the early hours\nwere soon overtaken. Many w. ere still dancing,others\nby now were content with simpler delights. Then\nDawn through st rfp ed awnings shot a timorous ray, which closed most eyes and thus eclipsed their day.\nrow PUT THE CAT OUT, J> EJ\\KT' MO\nOn enquiring of a friend what he had thought of\nthe new PHOENIX the following reply was obtained: \"Not bad.1\n. There's at least one good article in it.\" It would show a fine cynical spirit to invite readers\nto attempt to identify the article in question. It would also be most misleading and unkind, for this is a PHOENIX among PHOENIfiES , the swan-song, perhaps,\nof the retiring editor, and almost every tl ting in it is good. If there must be economies in form as reluctantly predicted by the Editor, no such bogeys,\neither in quality or quantity, have cast their shadows before to darken the pages of this issue. The\ngeneral appearance and presentation keeps up with the high standard we have come to expect during the\nlast twelve months, although it is perhaps a pity that major articles sometimes have to begin halfway\ndown, or at the bottom of a page.\nThose who are becoming awake to the spiritual deficiencies of I.C. life will find much that is thought provoking in the current issue. Those who\nare already exasperated by the least mention of such\nwords as liberal Education will find much that is merely provoking. J. C.M.T. "

Refectory. The Committee has been considering for some time a aeries of plans, based on figures and information worked out in great detail by the present Management, which were designed to reduce the\nyearly deficit. Several were discus aed at considerable length and the\neventual choice fell between two.\nBriefly, the fir at plan took the Ho a tel catering away from the\nRefectory, wh i oh would then have been used only for lu no he a, tea a and\n\" functions\". This plan was finally shelved in favour of the second\nfor various reasons, the principal one perhaps being that Bupport for it was,\nlea a unanimous than the Committee felt was necessary to warrant recommendation\nof ao dra a tica at ep. The ee o on d plan was to call in the firm of caterers who had been\nau oc esa ful at U. O. and see if they could tao kle our problem with equal succes a.| This has bean done; and from Easter the firm will be in charge of the\nRefeotory. They will be working with and through the pre a ent Refectory Committee, wh i oh will a till be responsible for all matters of policy and for any changes and reorganization wh i oh may from time to time be necessary.\nThe catering firm will take over after Easter} and for the fir at term no drastic changes are en via aged. At the end of the Summer Term, they\nexpect to be in a position to make proposals to the Committee aa to ways and\nmean a of dealing with our problem.\nThe Union Bar and the Ayrton Hall Refeotory (Queenie's) are not\na ffe o ted by this new arrangement and will o on tin ue under their pre a ent management s. IMP. COLL. EXPEDITIONS More news is now available concerning the proposed\nI.C. expeditions this year and next year. The\nNatural History Society say that the destination of\nthe major exo edition during the Long Vacation of\n1952 will be'East Africa. It is hoped to make an\necological survey of a selected region. To provide experience for possible members of\nthis expedition a pilot scheme is being organized for1951, to be run for1014 days during August.\nThe destination of this expedition has not yet been\ndefinitely fixed but it will not be Little Cumbrae\nas stated in the Christmas issue of FELIX. It will most likely be around or near the British Isles. Among localities under consideration are the Isle of Arran and the Earne Islands( off the N.W. coast). Those interested should apply to the Head of\ntheir Department, before Friday, March 2nd,1951 L.U.D. S. Festival\nL.U.D. S. provided us with two very pleasant\nevenings last week, in sponsoring the fourth Annu al Festival of One Act Plays, presented by various individual Colleges. The second evening was\neasily the best. I.C. gave a perform and e of Shaw's\" Passion, Poison and Petrifaction\" at least equal\nto that of Goldsmith's College on the previous night, but on the whole we considered that outstanding su co esse s of the festival were Kings production\nof Chekov'e \"The Proposal\", and West field's present-ation of \"The Florentine Tragedy\" by Oscar Wilde.\nS.

W. Midgley) via I.C. Union Rack.\nINTER COLLEGE EXPERIMENT As announced in Fi LIX no. 16, the inaugural 'South Ken. Linkup1 of the\nRoyal Colleges of Art, Music and Science took place on 5&h February in I.C. Union. It was the first 'pub-li c' result of the deliberations of\nan intercollegiate committee, formed\nto organize closer social relations ber we en the colleges. A debate on\nthe relation of Art, Music and Science to each other and their students\nwas followed by an informal buffet dance. R.C.A. and R.C.M. students\nwere somewhat outnumbered by R.C.S. A considerable number of Miners and\nGuildsmen were also present. The\nmeeting was favoured with the presence of Lord Falmouth, Chairman of the\nGoverning Body, the Rector, and mem-be rs of the academic staff of the\nR.C.M. and R.C.A. The chairman of the meeting was Mr. Frank Howes,\nMusic Critic of*; The Times', and also a member of\nthe R.C.M. staff. He reminded I.C. of their great\nstart in already combining three colleges into one,\nand then introduced the subject for the meeting:\nhow the students of Art, Music and the Sciences coul d bast get together, and learn something of each\nother. Tony de Reuck (R.C.S.) then spoke on the\nbroader purpose of the scheme: on the merits of spec i aliz ation v. generalization, on pure, narrow advancement of learning v. social benefit, and concluded with overwhelming support for having the broadest grounding in principles, enabling the individual to choose the niche that finally interests him.\nMr. J. Warrack (R.C.M.) opened his remarks with an outline of an internal problem of his college. They lack a Union, and have first to bridge the divisions of' craft' of pianists, singers, composers and orchestral players. Mr. Aapura (R.U.A.) chose as his main point t ne necessity of getting to know each other's aims before attempting to share\nand understand views. He denounced a present-day\ntendency to accept second-hand opinions as knowledge,\nfor lack of firsthand experience, and stressed the\nneed for international exchange and travel generally in students' education. Speakers from the floor variously advocated\nspecial( optional) lectures, such as those on History of Science now running in R.C.S., but wider in scape and .treatment, on each faculty' s principles and methods. Others took the opposite view, that lectures would be a bus man's educational holiday at\nhome, and suggested that exchanges would better be\narranged over coffee and lunch. One speaker wis hed that the broad range of ' school' subjects should\nbe continued to a higher stage; another prophesied that the schemes might produce ' Specialists in everything but their own sub j \u00abct(. Another s beaker was\noverheard to say that in the few minutes remaining\nhe would just survey human knowledge!\nProfessor Levy, Dean of R.C.S., summed up,tak-ing this on at short notice due to the Illness of\nMr. L.A.G. Strong. He pointed out how Science has\nto eliminate the human element from its methods -the very contrary of our present attempts to 'human-ize' our education. He picked out the point of the\nneed for understanding where others' attentions are\nfocused, and suggested the plan of action should be\nthe bringing together firstly of people: then of\ntheir ideas: and then of their work.\nThe next function will be held at 5.30 next\nMonday, 26th February, in the Botany Lecture Theat re,I. C. Union. Mr. L. Roth, M.A., of the Maths.\nDept. who spent some years in Italy will talk on\n'Opera in Italy'. This will be followed by a discussion and a light buffet. The chair will be\ntaken by David Hall, President of the R.C.M. Students Association.\nImp.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE.\nEPIDEMIC? CIRCULATION: 1200\nTHE REFECTORY\nAt last the Refectory Committee have taken a positive move to counter the appalling losses of the I.C. Refectory during the past few years. The peculiar difficulties of college catering the 'seasonal'\nturnover due to vacations and the wide disparity in the numbers of meals served at breakfast, lunch and\nsupper - must be remembered when assessing there a sons for the Refectory losses. Furthermore, one cannot deny that the meals served compare very favourably both in quality and price with those served in the average restaurant. The decision to call in outside caterers could hardly have been taken earlier as the unfavourable\nterms of previous quotations made them unacceptable\nto the college. It now s seems that the present catering firm John Gardners - after successfully feeding U.C. for a year are willing to try their hand\nhere - and on terms acceptable to the Refectory Comm it tee. We are glad to note that the Committee rejected the previous plan which involved the separation of Hostel residents from the rest of the college. The\ncollege is a single entity and whether we live in the Hostel or dig with Mrs. Sprogget or live on our parents it is essentially a Good Thing that we all mix together over meals.\nWe have got to see the consequences of calling in outside caterers. Some changes must result: if they are not always to our liking they can hardly be serious when weighed against a loss of \u00a36000 a year.\nARTS & SCIENCE\nThe organising committee of the Intercollegiate Experiment, reported in this issue, are to be congratulated on their venture to bring about closer ties between R.C.A., R.C.M. and R.C.S. The first meeting was well supported and more\nsuccessful than the organisers had dared to hope.\nIfR. CA. and R.C.M. were outnumbered we must remember that they are only small colleges and that some\nextra effort is always necessary to go along to a function outside one's familiar haunts. It was interesting and encouraging to see .a considerable number of Miners and Guildsmen present at the meeting -indeed the President of I.C. Union, in congratulating Mr. Peter Haskell on the success of the evening,\nhas asked him to act in future in the capacity of VicePresident of I.C.; and representatives from\nboth Guilds and Mines will shortly join the intercollegiate committee.\nWe emphatically do not share the view of our contributor on p.5 that these efforts are \"so much\nwaste of valuable time\". In spite of the alleged artistic inertia of the average I.C. student the present experiment can hardly worsen the situation. There is no question of trying to ram culture down\nthe scientist's throat or science down th a artist's: rather is it an attempt to facilitate a better und-er standing of each other's fields of activity by getting to know each other.\nIt is up to individual clubs and societies with common interests to put these ideas into practice. The first step has been taken by the Musical Society. Let us hope that our Dramatic Society, Jazz Club and\nmany others with counterparts in the other colleges will successfully get together in the future. PERSONAL ADVERTISEMENTS\nEntries for this column must be accompanied by cash.\nFor members of I.'C. the charge is the merely nominal\none of6 d. up to20 words, 1/- up to AO words.

From a survey of current literature it is apparent that there are many great moments in a young\ngirl's life, depending on what she discovers where,\nand when. But men have their moments too! It occurred to some of us that the Types-who live in bars should know that drops of brandy are\nnot merely delectable nectar, and that an eight some reel is something more than the tortuous path of a1/8 inebriated newt.\nIt is equally essential that the young ladies of R.C.S. should be able to recognize frolicsome Paddy, or a dashing white sergeant when they area round, and should realize that one may strip the. willow without being obscene!\nIt is with these thoughts in our minds, and the\nkind permission of the Union Committee, that we hast en to introduce these terms into the I.C. vocabulary, and the dances themselves into our coarse work.\nWe have demonstrated this' most enjoyable and eff ici ent method of dissipating surplus energy in the New\nLounge for the last three weeks, and have tested the strength of the floor. We think Scottish Dancing has -come to stay, and\nif you're at all interested a Highland Sch ott is che is much easier to do than spell. Ashley Bean.\n\u00a3 ENGINEERING\nSOCIETY\npresents a DEBATE on the motion that\n\"THISSOCIETY CONSIDERS THAT THE\nCURRICULUM OF THIS COLLEGE IS NOT\nSUITABLE FOR TRAINING ENGINEERS \"\nin Room 17 on Thursday, 1st March,1951\nat 5.10 p.m. Alt members of the academic staff of Guilds are\nparticularly welcome at this meeting.\nJAZZ CLUB At long last I.C. Jazz Club commenced active proceedings, when the President of the national Fede ration of Jazz Organisations, the Marquess of Doneg al, visited the club. He was accompanied by the Marchioness and Sinclair Traill, the celebrated jazz critic of 'Jazz Journal' fame.\nA most enjoyable record recital' illustrating the sundry facets of jazz through the years' was gre-at ly appreciated, as was evidenced by rapt attention, by an audience of some 50 enthusiasts and others who\nwere ' interested'. Via Jelly Roll Morton and Fats\nWaller^ and the range of Louis Armstrong fr on his 'Hot Five1 days until today, the experts travelled from the original New Orleans Jazz to Ralph Sutton's fine present day ragtime. The programme included several long playing discs issued both in this count ry and America, as well as the conventional78 rpm\nrecords. A word of praise must go to our' artist, C.D.B race well who produced the first class posters. We hope that even more of you will enjoy our next meeting, which will be fully publicised in due\ncourse.\nP.G. T.T. B. APPEAL CONCERT A concert in aid of the British Students' Tube rc u los is Appeal was given in the Royal Albert Hall on Friday,16 th Feb. The hall appeared to be fil led to capacity, and the concert was almost certainly a success financially. Whether it was a success \u2022\nmusically is rather doubtful. The London Student\nOrchestra has only recently been formed and their playing seemed rough, particularly in the overtures at the beginning and end of the concert. Schubert's' Unfinished' Symphony received quite a good performance although some members of the woodwind appeared\nto imagine they were playing Lehar. The orchestra were at their best in the Vaughan Williams and in 'Peter the Wolf, where Margaretta Scott was an uni n spire d narrator: The other soloist in( of course)\nTchaikovsky's first piano concerto was Abbey Simon,\nwhose performance was rather unsatisfactory: his pla ying of the third movement was by no means faultless technically. Boyd Neel was an excellent conductor\nthroughout.\n\n"
