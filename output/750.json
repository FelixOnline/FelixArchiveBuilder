    "content": "Featura\nFELIX, Friday October 17th198610 A View From\nThe Top\nby Robin Kerrod (FELIX Editor 1958/59)\n'It's Davy Jones on the line. Sounds\nlike a sailor to me. Didn't think you\nknew any sailors.' The wife's voice\ndrivels in from the hall. 'Says he's something to do with Felix. Didn't think you knew a Felix either. But\nyou do have funny friends.'\nWell of course it was our Davy\nJones. Please write something.\nSpecial issue. Short deadline.\nUnctuous flattery. You're one ofthe\nthe oldest. Didn't mean that. Not\ntoo long, not too short. You know\nthe sort of thing. Indeed I do.\nStrangely Dave phoned almost\nexactly 30 years to the day that I started my first term at IC.When\nCity and Guilds still had its Gothic\nportals; when the Colcutt Tower\n\u2022still had a building; when the\nsummers were always fine; when\ngrants were 70 quid a term. And of\ncourse when FELIX was very young indeed. When enthusiasm\nsubstituted for expertise. When it\nwas all cow gum, Indian ink and\nstencils and all-night panics twice a month to get the camera-ready\nboards down to a little Polish litho\nprinter down Earls Court way. And\nwhen we charged 3d( no, not three-I was editing a paint journal. Two\n\u2022years later found me technical editor\nof a children's encylopedia ('about\nyour level' everyone said, and they\nwere right). And by the decade's end\nI was writing science books for\nchildren full-time.\nThis was, you will recall, the\nApollo Moon landing era. With\n\u2022ghostly figures kangaroo-hopping\naround \u2022 the lunar surface; hot-rod ding it in the 16km/ h Moon\nbuggy; dropping feathers and a hammer to prove Galileo was right;\nhitting a golf ball for hundreds of\nmetres. That is when space began to\ntake me over. Things astronomical\nand astro nautical began to\npermeate my depths like a benevolent alien influence one reads\nabout in sci-fi.\nCome the. '80s and I am\nthoroughly space-washed. And it\nforces me (what a chore) to\ndisappear at regular intervals to\nparticularly fascinating parts of the\nglobe in search of 'stories' and\n'inspiration' and to witness\nsignificant astro nautical and\nastronomical events. Two such\nevents stand out. In spring 1981\ntragically demonstrated in January\nthis year when Challenger exploded\nin a spectacular fireball just after\nlift-off, killing the seven astronaut\ncrew and grounding the shuttle fleet.\nIt was a salutary reminder, as one\ncommentator put it, 'of the\nenduring hostility of space and the\nfragility of Man'. Until we come up\nwith a different way of beating\ngravity, except by high-explosive\nfire, spaceflight will continue to be\nan excessively dangerous\noccupation.\nA more recent highlight was\nchasing Halley's comet across the\nAustralian outback. The best views\nof Halley were to be got in the\nsouthern hemisphere, so there was\nlittle choice but to go down-under\nfor the once in a lifetime experience.\nSpending nights under the southern\nstars was spectacular. The southern\nskies are so much more brilliant\nthan our own, and of course in the\noutback there is no such thing as the\nlight pollution that besets\nastronomy in the civilised parts of\nthe world.\nThe Milky Way seems bright\nenough to cast a shadow. Halley\nstood out easily to the naked eye as a luminous wedge and, comparatively\nspeaking, raced across the sky.\nStrangely enough it was the wildlife\nthat occasionally upset viewing. Just\nwhen you'd set up your telescope\nand went to tell your friends, the\ndingoes came along and kicked-and\non one occasion peed upon- my\ntripod. And there was one\ncolleague, exhausted by a late\nviewing session, who fell asleep\nunder the stars and woke up at dawn\nwith a female kangaroo snuggled\nbeside him. Well, he was a nice\nlooking fella!\nThe Australian outback\n\"no such thing as\nthe light pollution\nthat besets\nastronomy in the\ncivilised parts of\nthe world\"\ndimensional but three old pence) for\neach copy. Yes, we had to pay our\nway. No sabbaticals and union\nsubsidies in those days!\nFor me FELIX found the parts\nother things couldn't reach. It\ntriggered off artistic bents that\nchemical engineering could not stifle\n(that is , if you stifle a bent). So by\n1960, following a stint at ICI Paints,\ncame the launch of the first space\nshuttle from Kennedy Space Center,\nwhich proved an awe-inspiring\nexperience as two test pilot\nastronauts rode a totally unproven\nvehicle into the heavens with no\nhope of escape if anything went\nwrong. What could have gone\nwrong, all through the subsequent\n23 missions, was so publicly and\nagain shall I extract the urine from\nthose Aussies who wear hats with\ndangling corks. In the outback the\nonly water lies underground and all\nthe lakes are salt flats. Flies descend\nmurderously on the unprotected\nflesh of those foolhardy enough to\nventure outside in temperatures up\nexperience was, well, original. We\nwent down opal mines in a town\ncalled Coober Pedy, which makes\nthe stage sets from old Westerns\nseem positively metropolitan. We\nclimbed (obligatory) Ayers Rock,\nwhich the Aboriginals call Uluru.\nWe sauntered in a town called Alice.\nAnd, like everyone else, barbecued\nfillet steak. But oh the flies! Never\nto 110\u00b0F. Oh, for at it fer with\ndangling corks. But don't forget to\nleave a gap in front. I spoilt reels of\nfilm because I didn't. And then it was off to Bali. Bali, I hear you say, what astronomical\ndelights await one there? In my case\nit was Patrick Moore, a delight\nastronomical if ever there was one.\nAnd there was an eclipse of the\nmoon due. Could anything match\nwatching a total lunar eclipse, with\nHalley's comet close by, and sipping\nSingapore slings with Patrick\nMoore on a balmy Balinese night?\nOf course not. We shall not see the\nlike of that again.\nWhere to next? Well, there just\nhappens to be a total eclipse of the\nsun in spring '88, with a path of\ntotality sweeping through Sumatra\nand the Philippines. Yomping\nhalfway round the globe to see day\nturn into night for just three minutes\nforty-five seconds cannot I suppose\nlogically be justified. But it beats\neating sausage sandwiches while\ndesigning chemical plants in\nBillingham.\nFelix, dear Felix. I owe it all to\nyou. Seven hundred and fifty times have you escaped from the presses.\nMay you continue to do so until\nHalley comes round again, and\nagain, and again.\nRobin Kerrod, known universally\nat IC as 'Killer', edited Felix in\n1958/9. He is a prolific author (he's now on his 95th title) of science,\nastronomy and space books for\nyoung people and the general\npublic. He also runs a small\npublishing company from his home\nnear Salisbury.\n\n"

Our event was organised\nin July and at that time we were\nunaware of the UGM meeting dates.\nWe did not put up the bulk of our\nposters on the day as a result, but by\nthen the damage was done.\nThe Industrial Society\nrec commends to all students of IC\nthat they attend UGM's, as they are\nthe best way for students to\ninfluence Union policy and be\nrepresented.\nYours\nPaul Basham\nDear Ed,\nI was interested to read the\nvarious comments on the\nIndsoc/UGM clash last Tuesday.\nBloody minded? Well, I don't really\nthink so - the date for the 'get-together' was fixed during the last\nacademic year, and we had no\ncomplaints from ICU before the\nevent. I fully support Christine's view, as expressed in her report, and\nthe Indsoc committee has agreed to\ncomply in future. As Membership\nSecretary I would like everyone who\nmissed the get-together to know that\nthey can still join Indsoc.

All the best.\nTrevor Power\nMech Eng 3\nFree Speech\nAnd NUS\nDear Sir,\nIt was very interesting to note in\nFELIX last week, a small article in\nwhich the NUS opposed a proposed\nGovernment bill allowing freedom\nof speech on British university\ncampuses. It struck me as somewhat\nhypocritical that the NUS wants to\nprotect the rights of blacks, gays,\nJews etc. in the light of the fact that\nsome NUS institutions, notably\nSunderland Polytechnic, have\nbanned their Jewish society on the\ngrounds that it is racist!\nPutting the hypocrisy aside for a moment, it is a highly suspect\nargument that one can somehow\nprotect minority groups by\ncensoring information. The NUS\nshould remember that freedom of\nspeech on campuses would not only\nallow the right-wing M.P.'s they\nmention to speak, but also all the\nminority groups that at present are\nunable to do so.\nYours Sincerely,\nJohn Ranson (Mech. Eng 2)\nP.S. If the overweight member of the\nUnion Exec, wants my legs, he can\ncome and cut them off himself. If he\ndoesn't,I suggest that he spends less\ntime making silly threats and\ndigging up petty rules, and more\ntime worrying about the\nconsequences of the hypocritical\nNUS taking over I.C.U. FEUX 750\nUpon reaching any milestone the\ntendency is always to be\nretrospective; in this instance, to\nassess the progress FELIX has made\nsince it was spawned from the\nPhoenix in 1949. Accordingly this\nweeks issue includes several articles\nby former Editors. Two of these\nmen were at College in the days of\nthe Imperial Institute, long before\nFE1IX had its own Print Unit or\nSabbatical Editor. Paradoxically\nthis 750th issue is the first to be\nproduced entirely in our new offices\non the northside of Beit Quad\nI am still not certain what effect\nthe move of the office will have on\nFELIX in the long term. The site in\nBeit Archway was indeed prime\none; I hope that being out \"of the\nway\" is not going to deter people\nfrom using the office. Looking at the\nstaunch support FELIX has had\nfrom its student staff over the years,\nI expect that the paper will continue\nto flourish.Nevertheless I would\nmaintain that FELIX, over the last\nten years particularly influential,\nand that the archway site was, at\nleast in part, responsible for this.\nCredits\nAnother tough week.

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday October 17th198620 Graded\nGrades\nThe University of London has\ndecided to take the controversial\nstep of revealing final exam marks\nto students from 1st October 1987.\nCurrently, the marks are\nconfidential because the element of\ndiscretion exercised by examiners in\nassessing degrees may lead to\nmisunderstandings. Under the Data\nProtection Act of 1984 the\nUniversity will be obliged to give\nthis information to individuals\nwithin 40 days of being asked,\nprovided it is stored on a computer.\nOther universities are considering\nusing loopholes to keep this\ninformation under wraps. They can\ndo this either by keeping manual\nfiles or by destroying all computer\nrecords of the marks within 40 days.\nFire Damage\nSerious damage was caused by a fire\nin the Department of Social and\nEconomic studies in Princes\nGardens on Wednesday. The fire\nwas discovered by a cleaner at\n6.35am on the second floor of the\nbuilding. An estimated \u00a34000 worth\nof damage was caused by smoke and\nflooding when a firehose was burnt\nthrough. A spokesman for the\nHumanities Department said that\nthe fire had probably been started\nby a cigarette carelessly discarded by\na student.\nSouthside\nIntruder\nA mysterious intruder has been\ndiscovered sleeping in the corridor\nof IC Radio in Southside, last week.\nThe man, who is in his twenties and\ndark skinned with a student-like\nappearance, has been loitering in the\narea for about three months, usually\noutside Southside shop. Following\ncomplaints from the assistants that\nthe man had been 'ogling' at them\npersistently, he was asked to move\non by Pat, The Southside security\nguard. He has not been seen for the\npast few days, but it is uncertain\nwhether or not his disappearance is\npermanent.\nSports Hall\nLobby\nThe Athletic Clubs Council has\ndecided to lobby the college for a new sports hall to replace the volley\nball court in the old Chemistry\nbuilding, which is due for\ndemolition soon. The Volley ball\ncourt is the only sports hall on the\nSouth Kensington site. The ACC\nhas recommended several sites for\nthe new hall, including the tennis\ncourts behind the Southside\nbuildings, in the Chemistry building\nor over the swimming pool. They\nsuggest that funds for the project\nshould come from the sales of gravel mined from the Harlington Sports\ngrounds.\nPrincess Anne At IC\nOn Monday Princess Anne visited\nthe college under very tight security\nfor the official opening of the\nScience and Technology exhibition.\nShe was welcomed by Lord Flowers\n(Vice Chancellor of London\nUniversity), the Rector Professor\nAsh and College Secretary John\nSmith. A group of 40 students\ncongregated to see her, but were not\nallowed into the JCR whilst she was\ntouring the exhibition.\nFallen\nArches\nThe decorative canopy at the front\nof the Civil Engineering building\nhas been dismantled for safety\nreasons. A spokesman for the\ndepartment explained that there had\nbeen problems with mosaic tiles\nbecoming dislodged.\nExec Protest At Charges\nA petition of 25,000 signatures was\nhanded over to Professor Sir\nRichard Harrison, Chairman of The\nBoard of Trustees of the British\nMuseum, at a demonstration\nagainst admission charges on\nThursday morning. Delegates from\nthe Museum Civil\nthe Association\nTeachers (AU\nAssociation of\nManagerial Staff\npresent, whilst IC\nwas represented\nService Unions,\nof University\nT) and the\nTechnical and\n(ASTMS) were\nStudents Union\nby President\nChristine Taig, Hon Sec Dave\nColley, Bill Goodwin and Mark\nCottle.\nThe Natural History and\nGeological museums are to\nintroduce compulsory charges from\nApril 1st. The Unions believe that\nthis move will be self defeating\nbecause the number of visitors will\nbe substantially reduced. IC\nStudents union are concerned that\nstudents will be discouraged from\nusing the museums to supplement\ntheir studies.\n\"It is ironic that the museum is\nstating the need for expansion as a reason for implementing the charges\nwhen they admit that the number of\nvisitors will drop by 40%\", said IC\nPCS Chairman William Lindsey.\nThe Shadow spokesman for the\nARCS, Mr Norman Buchan, told\nFELIX that the Goverment should\ntake the national heritage more\nseriously, and said that he would be\nraising questions on the subject in\nWestminster.\nChemistry\nScholarships\nThe Chemistry Department will be\nintroducing a scholarship scheme\nfor undergraduates taking degrees\nin Chemistry, or Chemistry and\nBiochemistry, next year. Four\nscholarships, each worth \u00a3800 a year, are to be provided by Galaxo\nGroup Research, Johhan Matthey\nTechnology Centre, Minnesota 3M Research, and PPF International.\nStudents will be selected for the\naward on the basis of their UCCA\napplications, academic reports, and\ntheir admission interview. Those\nshort-listed will be asked to write a statement explaining their interest in\none of the sponsoring companies,\nbut there will be no obligation to\nwork for the company at the end of\ntheir degrees.\nVery Old\nDragonfly\nThe most complete specimen of a Hawker dragonfly found to date has\njust been acquired by the Natural\nHistory Museum. The 125 million\nyear old insect had a wingspan of\n85mm and is described by its\ndiscoverer Ed Jarzembouski as\nbeing the best preserved specimen of\nan early Hawker dragonfly found so\nfar, Mr Jarzembouski, of the\nEntomology Department at the\nmuseum found the dragonfly in a Weald clay pit in Surrey. It is now on\ndisplay in the Central Hall.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday October 17th198611 T T>EBr TR0 R Of\nA torrid tale of terrible\ntorment. Any resemblance to\npersons living or dead is\npurely coincidental.\nThey came to Cheapskate on a warm\nrose coloured afternoon. The leaves in\nthe gardens rustled as if to warn them of\nthe bleak winter ahead.\nShe got out of the car, clutching her\nbooks, her cooking pots and her\nteddy\u2014who had been a friend for so\nmany years.\nTearful parents waved her\ngoodbye\u2014goodbye for the last time to\nthe most precious thing in their lives.\nShe sat alone in her room, filled with a curious mixture of awe, intense\nexcitement and a terrible sense of loss.\nShe expected so much from her new\nhome, her mind hungry, eager to\nexplore and discover. She sat upright,\nlike a flower at its moment of perfection.\nMeanwhile in another part of\nCheapskate John Secretary, the\nBaron's former right hand man fondly\nremembered what life was like when old\nBaron Weed was around. Then\nCheapskate was the jewel in the\nnation's crown and John Secretary had\nbeen the most powerful and influential\nman in Cheapskate.\nThis most honourable of men, now\ngrey and withered, no longer had any\ncontrol of this once great kingdom,\nBy\nJuvenal which he saw crumbling around his\nears.\nBut on the bright side, the new\nBaron, Derek Dash, had promoted\nJohn Secretary. He now had the\nsupremely important and responsible\ntask of standing on his head wiggling his\nlegs in the air\u2014which he was doing\nnow.\nAt that moment Derek Dash burst\ninto John Secretary's dungeon. In he\nran, fresh faced and eager on heat,\nsporting his new squash kit.\n\"Hi John,\" said Dash in his cultivated\ntransatlantic accent.\n\"Good afternoon Baron,\" said John\nSecretary with all the poise and dignity\nhis posture would allow.\" \"Do you have\nany more tasks for me today?\", he\nasked.\n\"Fraid so John me old cheroot,\" said\nDash. \"I have some important\nindustrialists visiting from that ces s pit\nnorth of Watford. I want to sell them\nanother part of Cheapskate.\"\n\"Yes,\" said John Secretary excitedly,\nwiggling his legs in the air.\nIn another part of the kingdom, the\nnew Falix Editor, Rabid Bones, was in a particularly bad mood. As well as his\nusual burdens, Rabid had to cope with\nthe loathsome former Falix Editors\npopping into his office to contribute\ntheir miserable articles for his\nanniversary issue.\nRabid was a mean son of a bitch. He\nnever smiled, he whipped his staff\nregularly and kicked a dog to death\nonce a week. Rabid thought he'd become a mean son of a bitch faster\nthan most of the old Falix Editors\nbecause he was far more intelligent\nthan them, but really it was because\nFalix was rapidly sucking the life out of\nhim.\nWill the student ever reach the stars?\nWill John Secretary regain his\nhonour?\nWill Rabid ever become a proper\nhuman being again?\nread the answer to these questions\nand many more in the next thrilling\nepisode of The Baron of\nCheapskate.\nBEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS No. 23: Pallab Ghosh,\nProfessional Paranoid.\nLast Sunday two men in Reykjavik\nkilled peace. So the media said. The\ntruth is that two business men couldn't work out a deal on how many times\nthey need to kill us all.\nThose at Imperial College, a centre of\nacademic excellence, smugly distance\nthemselves from such hippo cris y. But\nnow the idea of independent academic\ncentres of excellence seems as far in the\npast as the Edwardian ideals that\nspawned it.\nThe smart-suited smooth y from\nindustry is now coming to the rescue of\nailing universities with his magic cheque\nbook. And with him comes the big\ncompromise. As industry starts getting\nits hands on universities it starts\nbecoming part of the problem rather\nthan part of the solution. For what\nindustry wants\u2014with share holders\nbreathing down its neck\u2014is a fast buck.\nThus, inevitably, resources are\ndiverted away from blue-sky and\nsocially conscious research to areas\nthat make the fastest return on outlay.\nOnce academic institutions start\nbecoming fast buck factories the\natmosphere within them changes.\nProfits take precedence over\nexcellence and an environment\ndevoted to cultivating minds becomes\none which turns people into moneymaking machines.\n\"But we have to face realities,\" is the\nretort from College administrators,\n\"the money has to come from\nsomewhere.\" Such an attitude is the\nattitude of a balance sheet mentality.\nBalance sheet mentalities on the\nUniversity Grants Committee have\nsold academia down the river\u2014or more\nprecisely, to Reagan's Star Wars effort.\nThe Mole\n\n"

FELIX, Friday October 17th198617 Cross Country Club:\nWombling\nWith Hare and\nHounds\nThe first race of the season, a friendly with Thames Hare and\nHounds was held on Wimbledon\nCommon last Saturday. Despite the\nglorious weather and scenery, once\nagain it was only regulars who\nturned out. We were soundly\nbeaten, though it was a very\nenjoyable afternoon with tea cakes\nprovided until the pubs opened.\nDetails of future races are on the\nnoticeboard to the right of the main\nstairs on the ground floor of the\nunion Building.\nRugby: IC 'A' Team 52,\nSchool of Slavonic and\nEastern European Studies 7\nBrave Defence\nAs the score line suggests, this was a fairly one-sided match. However,\nSSEES never stopped trying, and\nthey got one try after some good\ncommitment, when the IC pack was\nin their 'let's go for a stroll' mood.\nTowards the end of the match, the\npressure was too much for them (42\npoints scored after half-time) and\nthe IC Backs ran some great trys.\nBadminton, Mixed Hammersmith League Div. 3: IC\nlost 6:3.\nPanic In\nHammersmith\nOur debut in the Hammersmith\nLeague was also marked by the first\nblunder of the season. Through\nsome rare miscalculation, the match\nsecretary managed to arrange two\nmatches on the same night. Needless\nto say, there was incredible panic\nand the club captain and team\ncaptain tried to sort things out.\nIn the other matches IC were\nbeaten 6:3.\nScience Fiction\nHyena Offal\nSomething I have always wondered\nabout is what makes people go into\nScience and Technology and end\nup in a place like Imperial.ls it the\nlove of the large pay cheques that\ngraduates receive? (Only if you go\ninto accountancy!) Is it the\npioneering spirit of working on the\nedge of human knowledge? (That\ncertainly doesn't apply here). Or is it\njust a way to get letters after your\nIndustrial\nBread & Fishes\nI 've heard tell that it is possible to\nfeed 5000 people on 5 loaves and 3\nfish. Couldn't have been easy. The\nIndsoc 'Get Together' took 160\nfrench loaves, 30 granary loaves,\n108 lbs of cheese and 140 litres of\nwine, provided with the help of\nSainsbury's. It was of course the\nfrench loaves which caused the\ntrouble. Sainsbury's weren't ready\nfor the size of our order, despite\nbeing warned, and had to start\nbaking rapidly. This took an extra\ntwo hours and left us with but one\nhour to prepare the food in College.\nIt was a mammoth task and no\nmistake, though by the end of the\nday Indsoc had obtained a membership of just over 400, which\nmakes it all worth it.\nSo now if you have joined Indsoc,\nall you have to do is come to a few of\nour events. The Saatchi and Saatchi\nSpeaker Meeting on the 21st( next\nTuesday) would be a good one to\nstart with. It is at lunch-time,\nstarting at 12.40 p.m., but you can\nget something to eat at the informal\nbuffet afterwards. Come along to\nChem Eng Lt 1 on the day and\ndiscover advertising. Also next\nweek is the Price Waterhouse\nbusiness game on the Wednesday.\nGet in touch with Trevor Power in\nMech Eng 3 for more information,\nbut hurry.\nIf you want to join Indsoc, it costs\n\u00a31.50, after which all events are free.\nSend a cheque made out with your\nname & department to Trevor\nPower's pigeon hole (once again)\nand he will send your membership\ncard by return of post.\nAlternatively, join at the speaker\nmeeting.\nname and I.C.'s good because you\nend up with four extra letters free of\ncharge? Whatever the conscious\nreasons, there are doubtless many\nsub con cio us reasons lurking in the\nbackground explaining why you\nchose a certain subject. I suspect\nthat many people in college first\ncame upon the idea of science in the\npages of some piece of science-fiction they read as children, and\nthat it has not been insignificant in\nyour final choice of career.\nWhether this is true or a complete pile of hyena offal, it\nserves as a useful introduction to\nthis description of what SFSOC is\nactually getting up to. We are a very\nvaried club and our members can\nget involved to any degree they\nwant. At the very highest end we\narrange visits to SF conventions\nand gatherings, write stories and,\nsoon, will produce a magazine. Any\nsubmissions would be most\nwelcome. For those people who still\nlike reading science fiction, and it\nreally isn't all ray guns, spaceships\nand chromed robots and all, we\nhave a large library from which\nbooks may be borrowed. This is\nopen every Thursday lunchtime\nand is situated on the top floor of the\nUnion Building. If you want to read\nSF cheaply or can't find the book\nyou want in the shops, feel free to\ncome along and join us.\nIn all our activities though we like\nto enjoy ourselves and there's nothing quite like a good all-action\nfilm for that. Our film shows are how\nmost people get to meet SFSOC\nand we've got a cracking one lined\nup for Tuesday. Indiana Jones\nand the Temple of Doom will\nstart at 7 p.m. in Mech Eng 220 on\nTuesday 21st October, entrance\n50p for members and \u00a31.50 for non-members, which includes SFSOC\nmembership. It's a fantastic film and\nI hope to see lots of you there. Till\nthen, share and enjoy!\nRag\nCollect \u00a3200\nAnd now to write about the next rag\nstunt being organised for October\nthe 18th. This is yet another event\ntraditional to Imperial College, and\nfor those monopoly fiends' out\nthere, this is for you! Have you ever\nplayed monopoly? Really played it I mean. Using London as the\nmonopoly board, travelling\nbetween the destinations not by\nrolling dice but by London\nTransport? That's what Imperial\nCollege students will be doing in\nteams of 2 to 4, dressed up in\noriginal dress and carrying a mascot\neach, on Saturday October 18th. The idea will be to set off round\nLondon to destinations on the\nMonopoly board armed with rag\ncans, travelcard, set of clues and an\nA to Z. At each destination, a clue\nwill need to be solved, and there will\nbe a live 'community chest', though\nwe cannot guarantee that we can\nget you out of 'jail' if you land in\nthere. The winning group will\nreceive a camera as prize, points\nbeing awarded for money collected,\nnumber of clues solved, original\ntransport used and any unusual\nobjects you might 'acquire' along\nthe way. For those who participate,\nthere will be a pop concert in the\nHammersmith Town Hall held free\nafterwards with a bar 'til 12.00\nmidnight, doors opening at 6.30pm, bands on at 8.30pm, with disco.\nLoads of other students from other\nuniversities will be attending the\nconcert in the evening; people from\nLoughborough rag, South Bank\nrag, Bristol and Birmingham rags,\nso I expect a good turnout from our\nown Imperial College rag. The\nbands playing will be our very own\nbred Blue, Blue Ice who played at\nthe Funeral Party, and also Tri -60\nwho are semi-professional and a very versatile band. Tickets for\nnon-participants of Monopoly\nare available to IC students with\nUnion cards at 50p each from\nthe Union office, in advance\nonly, so come and buy your\ntickets early.\nThis will be the last major rag\nstunt before rag week in November,\nso support your rag and have loads\nof fun too. Specific details of\nMonopoly will be appearing soon,\nso keep your eyes open and enrol\nwhen the posters go up!\nA final re-mention of thanks to\nthe participants of Tiddleywinkslets hope Saturday 18th will be yet\nanother Rag Success!\nRAG TIMETABLE\nFriday 17th October\nSCR 12.45pm Monopoly\nHammersmith Town Hall Concert\nAllocation of duties etc... .\nDistribution of license.\nFriday 24th October\nLounge 12.45pm Debrief of Monopoly/Town Hall\nRag Week events/publicity\nAllocation of duties etc....\nFriday 7th November\nSCR 12.45pm Rag Week Preparations\nAdvertising distribution\nFinal details distribution for Rag\nWeek.\nFriday 28th November Rag Week debrief\nSCR 12.45pm National Rag Conference\nFriday 5th December\nLounge 12.45pm \u2022\nRag Committee Cheese and Wine\nDiscussion of future events.\nNational Rag Conference in\nLoughborough.\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nrecords\nr New Model Army - The Ghost of\nCain\nI wasn't sure whether I liked New\nModel Army or not until I heard\ntheir new album. I first saw them\nwhen they played at an IC fresher s' do several years ago. At that point\nthey were making a noise\nsuspiciously like a heavy rock band\nwhile sitting around with a lot of\nother groups in the rather outdated\ncategory of \"New Wave\". Since\nsigning to EMI in October 1984\ntheir excellent single \"No Rest\" has\ntaken them beyond the Indie charts,\nwhere they have had consistent hits.\nWith luck \"The Ghost of Cain\" will\nturn them into a big enough success\nfor their controversial ban from the\nUnited States to be overcome.\nNM A are not the sort of band\nwho dither around with lyrics and\nstatements. Perhaps it is not so\nsurprising that occasionally they\nhave a clash with the authorities -like the IBA who banned their single\n\"Vengeance\". At the same time, it is\ndifficult to argue with the\nuncompromising nature of \"Only\nstupid bastards take heroin\" or the\nlyrics of \"Western Dream\", a song\nwhich sounds like a direct attack on\nthe commercial policy of Top of the\nPops. Don't get the impression that\nNM A are just some post-punk\npower combo though. The tracks\n\"Lovesongs\" and \"Ballad\", and the\nharmonica of Mark Feltham from\n\"Nine Below Zero\" make this a very\nvaried, though not variable, album.\nProducer Glyn Jones has worked\nfor Led Zepplin, The Who, The\nRolling Stones, The Clash, Joan\nArmatrading and many more, and\nyou can take him as a fair guarantee\nof rock credibility.\nThis record will certainly get a vote from me as one of the year's top\nten albums. In fact I'd go along with\nthe press release which says \"Britain\nin the 1980s has for the most part got\nthe music it deserves; bland,\nun challenging and unoriginal.\nNEW MODEL ARMY are a major\npart of the opposition.\"\nMark Cottle\nThe Rose of Avalanche,\nVelveteen,\nFire Records.\nThe eagerly awaited second single\nby the Rose? I hadn't heard of The\nRose, before, but apparently their\nprevious single made it to the Indie\ntop 5. Velveteen is a bouncy little\ntrack, with a very sixties guitar y feel\nto it, not unlike the Velvet\nUnderground. Despite one or two\nwell worn tricks, I quite like it. I won't rave about it, but I 'll play it\nagain.\nThe Rose will be playing the\nTown and Country Club, Kentish\nTown on 2nd November.\nDavid and David\n'Boomtown'\nA&M records\nThe Davids' boomtown is a desperate place. A place where the\ncocaine is in the dresser, and you\npick your own habits (they've got\nplenty to go around). A place full of\ndisillusion, where money makes a succulent sound. So this is\nHollywood, complete with\nsports case, cocaine, casual sex and,\nof course, money. Unlike Ellis' glib\nbest seller 'Less than Zero' which\nglorified the L.A. Highlife, this\nrecord paints a colder picture. Even\nover the sparkling new wav ish score,\nthis sounds as jaded and streetwise\nas even Tom Waits at his most\nprobing.\n'So welcome to my boomtown'\nThe tunes of 'Boomtown' generally\navoid the tiresome formulae used by\nsome of their contemporaries. A standard line-up of guitar, bass,\ndrums and synth parts that enhance\nrather than overwhelm, takes up\nthrough progressions and melodies\nwhich are remarkably fresh and\ninventive-if a little American. David\nBaerwald's voice, wrecked by\ncigarettes, Springsteen with a sore\nthroat (to my mind the best way to\nhear Springsteen), whilst David\nRickett the composer mercifully\navoids the temptation of becoming a 'gee-tar' hero in the American\ntradition. I liked it.\nPete Wilson\n\"// you can't find satisfaction in ICI\nyou'd be struggling elsewhere\"\nKen Moran has held a variety of jobs in ICI Mon d Division's Research and\nDevelopment Department\nsince graduating four years\nago. He describes his time\nwith ICI as 'the best in my\nlife. I work with lots of\ndifferent people, have\nresponsibility and travel the\nworld.'\nAt present Ken is\nresponsible for membrane\ncell technology in the\nChlorine Group. 'In order to\ndo the job I work with\nengineers, process\noperators, research and\ndevelopment scientists and\npeople from the commercial\nside.\n'I 've had a high rate of\nchange in my life since\nbeing in ICI. It seems to me\nif you can't find satisfaction\nin ICI you'd be struggling\nelsewhere.'\nICI are recruiting graduates from all\ndisciplines.

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday October 17th19865 THE INDEPENDENT\nFELIX media watcher Andy Vickers\nreviews the launch of Fleet Street's newcomer\nTuesday 7th October saw the launch\nof the first new quality British\nnewspaper since that of FELIX in\n1949. To meet this challenge,\nAndrew Vickers set out to give it a bad review. Here are his findings:\nAs I was unable to buy a copy of\nThe Independent on its first day, I watched that evening's news reports\non T.V. Of the new newspaper's circulation, the following facts were\nquoted:\n1) The launch print run of The\nIndependent was 600,000.\n2) This number was sold out by\nlunchtime.\n3) The same run will be used on\nthe second day and until demand\nfalls off.\n4) Target run is 400,000, which\nhas been exceeded temporarily.\n5) This target is lower than the\nother three quality papers, whose\ncirculation is approximately:\nTelegraph 1.1 million\nGuardian 500,000\nTimes 450,000\nComments on The Independent\nfrom other Fleet Street editors did\nlittle to help me form my own\nopinion.\nMax Hastings of The Telegraph\ncalled it \"informed but dull\". Others\nwere reluctant to admit that it came\nup to the standard of the 'big three'.\nNone the wiser, I vowed to buy one\non Wednesday morning.\nHaving managed to find a copy,\nmy second objective was to see if it\nreally was independent, so I read the\npolitical news. The complete page\ndedicated to the Tory party\nconference seemed a good place to\nstart. Party Chairman Norman\nTebbit's speech was quoted in\nsummary - no comments, as was\nEducation Secretary Kenneth\nBaker's no comment.\nThe same was true of the orations\nof John Mayor (Minister for Social\nSecurity), John Patten (Housing)\nand Norman Lamont (Treasury).\nEven a tiny item about Avon\nCounty Council refusing leave to\nthe allegedly racist teacher,\nJonathan Savery, for attending the\nconference contained no comments.\nOK, fine. I wondered about juice,\nscandal, muck. Was there any? Not\nuntil I read the centre pages. The\ntitle of these pages was \"Media\" -appropriate I suppose, as most of\nthe sordid revelations of the\nnational press are sensational is ed by\nFleet Street anyway. Articles had\nbeen written on the Wyman-Smith\naffair and the subsequent\ncommercial is ation of Mandy Smith,\nCity Limits magazine, Neil Kinnock\nand the \"capitalist\" press (The\nIndependent is owned by a consortium of city wizards) and a comment (yes - a comment) on\nracist advertising.\nMy conclusion was that these\ncentre pages were not quite\npolitically independent - they could\nhave been printed on pink paper.\nThe next focus of my attention\nwas the editorial. Under the title\n\"The best form of defence\",\nSecretary of State George Younger\nwas warned of the impending\ncollapse of Conservative defence\npolicy. A retreat from the Falkland\nIslands was suggested as the least\nunpalatable method of cutting\nexpenditure. Although this looks\nlike an attack on government policy,\nit ended by saying that Labour and\nthe Alliance defence policies were\neven more unstable.\nUnder the title \"Third World\nFollies\", phrases like \"The\nirrepressible Mr M Bow\",\n\"Autocratic stewardship\",\n\"political patronage\", \"repressive\nstates\" and \"block of non-democratic states\" stuck out like\nsore thumbs. But then the point of\nthis rant was not an attack on the\nactivities of UNESCO and its\nleadership, but more a note of\ncongratulation to Britain for\nstepping out and staying out of that\n\"club\".\nSo far the editorial has been left of\ncentre of the right (?). However,\nunder \"Fair's Fair Shares\" the\ninhabitants of that Mecca of all true\ncapitalists - the city - were labelled as\nmarauding sharks. Predictably on\nthis issue (privatisation), the\nGovernment came off badly.\nIn summary then, the editorial\nhas had a go at every party\n(including the Alliance) and so\ncould easily be called 'independent'.\nTwo games of badminton in the\nlast four years will not make me a candidate for sportsman of the year.\nSimilarly, 2'/2 pages of sport out of\n32 will not earn a nomination for\nsports paper of the year. That aside,\nthe sports coverage was wide and\ninformative. Hardly inspired, but\nnonetheless interesting. I 'll leave it\nat that.\nThe pages of business news were\ngood. News of mergers, prices,\nmoney markets, profits, unit trusts,\ncutbacks and law were good. The\nCity may welcome The Independent\nas an adequate supplement to the\nFinancial Times, and possibly as a replacement for The Times.\nFinally, my overall opinion of\nThe Independent is good. Although\npolitical comments are made\n(though rarely), they are balanced. I believe that it will make a worthy\nrival to the big three, and will\nprobably become one of the new big\nfour. With a three week money back\noffer (issue 2, page 26),who could\nfail to give it a chance. To its staff I say \"Best of luck\"\nUlU travel\nTwice the size \u2014\nTwice the service\nCall into the new ULU Travel\noffice and see how far\nyou can go this winter\nSpecial fares for students\nand academics.\nWorldwide scheduled\nflights on quality airlines.\nw fi \u2022 Ski holidays.\n' \u2022 Winter breaks around\n^k.\\I Europe.\nISIC cards, ISIS\ninsurance, Group rates-winter Warmers include \u2014 daily\nCl la flights to New York \u00a3 2 2 2 ^tr,\n(^t jP^>*_] Read all about it in your free copy\nof HOT NEWS Enquiries and Bookings S E3\nEuropearv01-581 8233\nIntercontinental 01-581 1022\nULUtravel\nImperial College\nSherfield Building\nA service of\nsm\nTheWorldbeaters\nThe world's greatest student travel organisation - getting bigger all the time!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday October 17th198612 Maggie's Farm\nMartin S Taylor (1982-83) discusses pressure groups and\nfreedom of speech.\nOne of my favourite political\ncartoons is by the American artist\nRon Cobb. It dates from end of the\nVietnam war, and shows a middle\nages, middle class citizen reading a newspaper incredulously; 'Christ!\nAfter all the lives we lost giving\nfreedom to the South Vietnamese\npeople all they do with it is criticize\nPresident Thieu'\nThe comedian Michael Flanders\nmade a similar joke in his revue At\nthe Drop of a Hat-\\ take it everyone\nhere is in favour of freedom of\nspeech-at least, provided it isn't calculated to change our Western\nway of thought'.\nIt's very easy to approve of\nfreedom of speech as long as it will\nbe used for causes we approve of. I was caught out this way when\nreading Amnesty, the journal for the\nhuman rights group Amnesty\nInternational, and, incidentally, one\nof the most depressing magazines\npublished. I am an enthusiastic\nsupporter of Amnesty's work, but I was abashed to read that they\ncampaign on behalf of Jehovah's Witness, extreme right-wing groups,\nfanatical Moslems, and all sorts of\ndubious causes (provided they do\nnot advocate violence).\nNow I don'tsu bc ribe to the belief\nof these people, but I do agree with\nVoltaire's famous maxim; I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to\nsay it. Which brings me to the main\npoint of this article.\nLast Friday's FELIX included a paragraph announcing a new NUS\ncampaign. Apparently the NUS\nhave decided that the National\nFront is such an enormous evil that\nwe are being asked to prevent them\nand similar right-wing groups from\naddressing meetings at universities\nand colleges thro ug th out the\ncountry.\nIf this is true, then it is one of most\nmisguided ideas and the NUS has\never proposed, and one IC Union\nmust have nothing to do with-indeed, this is one of the most\neloquent argue ment s when put\nforward for not joining the NUS\n(who assert that they present the\nviews of the whole student body).\nFor while it is admirable to show\nthe National Front that their views\nare re pug ant to us, denying them a platform is both hy pro critical and\nfoolish for a number of reasons.\nFirsty, there is the forbidden fruit\nproblem. If you tell someone that\nsomething is so wicked they mustn't even be allowed to known what it is,\nhuman nature dictates they will try\nit at the earliest opportunity;\nremember what you thought of sex\nwhen you were thirteen?\nSecondly it's important to know\nwhat the National Front stands for,\nin order to argue effectively against\nit. To criticise them as a bunch of\nfascist thugs when you have no\nknowledge of their ideals is to fall\nback on the pre digested thing of Sun\nreaders.\nThirdly there is the precedent it\nwill set. If we deny the National\nFront a platform today, who will we\nban tomorrow? Scientologists?\nGreens? The SDP?\nIn case anyone has still not taken\nmy point, let me reaffirm that my\nattitude does not spring from a political viewpoint somewhere to\nthe right of Goering; I am just as\ncritical, and for the same reason, of\nthose who pre-emp t iv ely remove\npublicity for CND meetings. The\nprinciple is ultimately one of\ncensorship; do you want to delegate .\nyour thinking to your union (ICU or\nNUS) or are you responsible enough\nto decide for yourself?\nIthe\n1\nBLUEBELLS\nHosellout\nHo\nsurrender\nVictory to\nthe miners Tested and Measured for Success\nDatron Instruments is setting the pace in the design of high\ntechnology test instruments - these currently include Digital\nMultimeters; Calibrators and Calibration Systems.\nTo maintain our technical leadership were gui re graduates\nwho can combine flair and innovation with aptitude for\ndesign in any of the following disciplines:\nAnalogue advanced circuit designs in the f re gu en cy range\nDC to 1MHz.

    "content": "\" SM9 jA8y Les Liasons Dangereuses seems\ndestined to be the next fight-for-a ticket show in the West End,\ncontinuing in the tradition of its\nRSC predecessor Les Miserables.\nTherefore those who like to be\nculturally up-to-date should hastily\nbeat a track to the Ambassadors'\nBox Office as ticket sales are already\nsoaring.\nRightly so; the play by\nChristopher Hampton (of Savages\nfame) is a fine theatrical piece which\ndeals with decadence and 'sexual\nliberalism' in 18th century France,\nbeing based on a scandalous novel\nof the period by Laclos. The\nperformance has style, assurance\nand a considerable amount of\nhumour, bawdy and otherwise,\nwithout amounting to more farce.\nThe acting is strong all round,\nLindsay Duncan and Simon\nMatticks bring intelligent polished\nvillainy to their two leading\ncharacters whilst playing up to the\ndeeper, more psychological side of\nthe plays, which runs beneath the\nplot in a manner one might expect\nfrom modern French cinema.\nHowever, one cannot but be\nentertained by this thoroughly\nunpleasant story of two dissolute\naristocrats corrupting a young\nconvent girl (Beatie Edney from\nHighlander), and the fine details of\nthe production- the set, the\nmenacing incidental music and the\nchoreographed dramatics of the\nclose are all particularly pleasing.\nShould be seen. A modern play in\nmany senses.\nAlex McNeil\ntheatre A books\nT For those of us, like me, whose\nknowledge of poetry extends to the\nFaber book of Nursery Ryhmes, Nine\nNot so Modern Poets or The Oxford\nBook of Longer Boring Poems, I decided to examine the works of\nthree poets, all male, all dead, all\nWestern, I'm afraid: Tennyson,\nBetjeman and Eliot\nTennyson was very definitely a son of the nineteenth Century whose\npoetry went tum it y tum it y tum it tum it and rhymed in all the right\nplaces. His poems may have a slightly depressing effect; he wrote\nabout death, usually glorious\n(Charge of the Light Brigade) or the\npangs of despised love (Locksley\nHall), and also tended to prefer\nromantic themes, like King Arthur,\nor the death in battle of Sir Richard\nGrenville. In fact it's probably only\nbecause we are used to pretentious\nverse that has no rhyme or rhythm\nand lines of all different lengths that\nSir Alfred Tennyson's seems dated.\nAnyway, here are some samples so\nthat you can judge for yourself.\nWhen Idi pt into the future far as human eye could see;\nSaw the Vision of the World and all the wonder that would beIn the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;\nIn the Spring the wanton Lapwing gets himself another crest;\nIn the Spring a livelier Iris changes to the burnish'd dove;\nIn the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love\nBoth Betjeman and Tennyson were\nPoet Laureates, and both wrote\npoesy with rhyme and meter, but\nthere the resemblance ends.\nBetjeman is a lot more modern and\ntherefore accessible, and writes\nabout more ordinary happening.\nHe is unashamedly middle-class\nin both subjects and outlook but can\nnevertheless lampoon the snobbish\nnarrow-mindedness of his own\nbreed in poems such as In\nWestminster Abbey:\nGracious Lord, Oh bomb the Germans.\nSpare their women for thy sake,\nAnd if that is not too easy\nWe will pardon Thy Mistake.\nBut gracious Lord, Whate'er shall be,\nDon't let anyone bomb me.\nMany of his poems are concerned\nwith architecture, and quite a few\nwith women; at school we were all\nconvinced he was a Dirty Old Man.\nOthers are in a kind of gentle, rose-coloured spectacle mode, like Upper\nLambourne, about a major racehorse training village.\nUp the ash-tree climbs the ivy,\nUp the ivy climbs the sun,\nWith a twenty thousand pattering,\nHas a valley breeze begun.\nFeathery ash, neglected elder,\nShift the shade and make it run.\nT.S. Eliot is the most pretentious of\nthe three writers, more modern in\nstyle if not in date than Betjeman.\nHe believed that poetry had been\nmade 'too easy' for people to\nunderstand, and to remedy this put\ninto his lots of obscure Greek words\nand underlying metaphors. When\nnot showing off, his poetry is\nextremely lyrical and beautiful;\nApril is the cruel list month, breeding\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\nMemory and desire, stirring\nDull roots with spring rain.\nEliot also wrote plays in verse,\none of which, Murder in the\nCathedral, is especially lovely. This\nexplores the theme of conflict\nbetween temporal and spiritual\npower (or servitude) enacted in the\nmurder of Thomas a Beckett. This is\na bit like a Greek tragedy in format-there is a chorus of the women of\nCanterbury, and all violent doings\nare separate from the narrative.\nTT S. ELIOT Flash'd all their sabres bare,\nFlash'd as they turn'd in air,\nSabring the gunners there,\nCharging an army, while,\nAll the world wonder'd Plunged in the battery-smoke\nRight thro' the line they broke;\nCossack and Russian\nReel'd from the sabre-stroke\nShatter'd and sunder'd. Then they rode back, but not,\nNot the six hundred.\n\u00a7\n-S rt's. a33 \u2014\ns i3s You know, and do not know, what it is to act or suffer.\nYou know and do not know, that action is suffering,\nAnd suffering action. Neither does the agent suffer\nNor the patient act. But both are fixed\nIn an eternal action, an eternal patience.\nTo which all must consent that it may be willed\nAnd which all must suffer that they may will it,\nThat the pattern may subsist, that the wheel may turn\nand still\nBe forever still.\nAnd on that note, goodbye.\nSarah Kirk\n\n"

    "content": "Sabbaticals FELIX Friday October 17th19864 Union Cards Grabbed\nThe past week in the office has been\nfull of horrible non-stop queries\nabout parking permits, gym\nbookings and Union cards. Parking\npermits and bookings have now\nbeen distributed, if you feel you've\nmissed out we're sorry, it's a difficult\ntask trying to allocate scarce\nresources like these when there are\nhundreds of worthy causes. As for\nthe union cards, we haven't got any\nleft because they were stolen. If you\nneed a student card you can still get\na University of London Union card\nwhich will allow you to use facilities\nhere and in other Colleges.\nCouncil\nThe council meeting on Monday\nnight was good in at least two\nrespects; firstly that it was well\nattended and secondly that it was\nshort. Council is the 'managing\nbody' of the Union; consisting of 46\nUnion Officers, at least one of\nwhom represents you. If you have\nnever heard of council or didn't know you were represented on it,\nask your departmental representative about it.\nCouncil makes decisions which\nthe Sabbaticals and other officers\nshould abide by, for example, the\nviews and ideas they should take to\nCollege, the way they should spend\nmoney, and action they should take\non internal and external affairs.\nMinutes of this meeting will be\nposted publicly in a week or so.\nOne of the issues raised at Council\nwas that of the Deputy President's job, which, since the takeover of the\nbar and snack bar, has become too\nmuch for one person. The workload\non Jen, the Union's permanent\nadministrator, is also ridiculously\nlarge. We are therefore setting up a 'working party' (though I hate to\nuse the phrase) to decide how the\nwork should be re-distributed,\npossibly by taking on another\nsabbatical. Anyone interested in the\nUnion re-organisation, whether or\nnot you're a Council member or\n'Officer', can take part see Jackie or\nmyself in the Union Office.\nGet Involved\nThere are a few places on Union and\nCollege committees still empty.\nThese is 1) one place on the Union\nExternal Affairs committee, which\ndeals with all things relevant to\nstudents but not specific to Imperial\ne.g. grant campaigns, accommodation, etc; 2) one place on the\nUnion House Committee which\nallocates money for the upkeep of\nthe Union Building and other Union\nrooms; 3) two places on the College\nradiation safety committee, which\ndeals with radiation problems\nthroughout the whole college, and\n4) one place on the reactor safety\ncommittee which, like the reactor, is\nbased at Silwood park.\nIf anyone has a special interest in\nany of these fields would like to get\ninvolved, let me know. Remember\nthat the posts of Welfare Officer and\nPublicity Officer of the Union are\nstill vacant; papers are up in the\nUnion Building ground floor. To\nstand, you need a proposer and ten\nsecond ers; election will take place at\nthe UGM on 4th November. Any\nquestions - come and ask us.\nFinally\nAll the Rockers amongst you get\ndown to the Union tomorrow...live\nband (featuring the meanest bass\nplayer since Norman Jardine), rock\ndisco and cheap booze..see you\nthere.\nChristine\nlooking for\nRoyal College of\nScience\nAssociation\nCareers Forum\nOctober 30th6.30 pm in the\nSenior Common\nRoom\nAn opportunity to meet people\nfrom a broad spectrum of the\nindustrial, commercial and\nmanagerial world, able to offer\nadvice on careers and\nprospects.

GARTON.\n(IC 80-83)\nat\nSHERFIELD BUILDING ANTE ROOM\nMONDAY 21st. OCT. at 6pm. The World Outsid\nOne of the most important aspects\nof this wonderful democracy thing\nwe're supposed to have is the\nelectoral system. It affects YOU and\nit is important that you should be\nsure you have a vote. The next\nedition of the electoral register for\nthe country is being compiled at this\nvery moment. The initial deadline\nfor registering has in fact past but\nthis doesn't mean you will be\nexcluded. If you live in College Halls\nand Houses your name should have\nbeen automatically submitted for\nthe local constituencies. Also you\nmay well be registered at your home\naddress as a postal voter, this\nneed n't stop you being registered\nhere as you can choose which\nconstituency to vote in for national\nelections and you are entitled to\nvotes in both for some local\nelections.\nIf you are unsure whether you are\non the new register or not then the\ndraft version should be available for\nchecking at local council offices\nfrom November 28th. You then\nhave until December 16th to correct\nany omission. As long as you are\nover 18 and a British or Irish citizen\nthen there is no reason for you to be\nomitted from the register (certainly\nnot if you are a student here).\nRemember this could be your last\nchance to have a say in the next\ngeneral election, it affects YOU\nNOW!\nOn another matter concerning\nrights, in a few weeks time there will\nbe a week of events in college\ndevoted to public ising and raising\nmoney for campaigns against\nhuman rights abuse. Although\nmuch of the material you will see\nwill be from political clubs and\nsocieties, human rights is essentially\na non-political issue. Much of the\norganisation is done by Amnesty\nInternational whose apolitical\nstatus is regulated by their\nrelationship to organisations such as\nthe UN. As a prelude to Human\nRights Week, I am producing a special centre section for FELIX\nand I would welcome any\ncontributions from people\nconcerned with particular cases of\ndenial of human rights or general\ncampaigns in this field. Please try to\nspare some time and effort for this\nspecial event, there are people out\nthere in the real world dying and\nsuffering repulsive agonies for\nwhom you may be the only hope.\nMark Cottle\nExternal Affairs\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded1949 Play School The University of London's Institute of Education and students\nfrom the School of Oriental and\nAfrican Studies (SOAS) have\nlaunched the 'London Childcare\ncampaign' in an attempt to persuade\nuniversities in London to improve\ntheir nursery facilities. Teaching and\nstudent unions are being\nencouraged to lend their support,\nand motions in favour of the\ncampaign are due to be raised at\nImperial College on the 4th of\nNovember and the The University\nof London's Union (ULU) on the\n28th of October.\nThe Institute of Education\nbelieves that present facilities are\ninadequate and un affordable for\nmany students and staff because of\nthe University Grants Committee's unwillingness to allow their funds to\nbe spend on childcare. They also\nbelieve that this contravenes the\nCollegiate council's declaration in\nDecember 1984 that 'no regard\nshould be taken of a persons race,\nsex, age, marital status (and)\nnumber of children' when\nappointing university staff.\nAt present, say the institute,\nnursery facilities are badly coordinated with some being over\nsubscribed whilst others are\nunderused. The facilities at Imperial\nCollege provide space for forty-three children from six months to\nfive years old. About one third of\nthe users are postgraduates, but the\nfee of \u00a342 a week has meant that this\nis rarely used by undergraduates\nthough a grant of \u00a310 per week is\navailable for a limited number of\nusers. The waiting time varies from\ntwo months to over a year in the case\nof the baby room.\nIC Union President Christine\nTaig is worried that students with\nchildren will be deterred from\nstudying at universities because of\nthe high charges. She feels, in\nparticular, that more female\nstudents could be encouraged to\nenrol at Imperial if the nursery were\nless expensive.\nMiss Taig will be issuing a questionnaire on behalf of the child\ncare campaign at a future date.\nFELIX staff members hard at work pasting up this week's issue in the new\noffice\nThreat To Funding\nResearch in universities is under\nanother threat. A secret Cabinet\nCommittee chaired by Paul\nChannon, Secretary of State for\nTrade and Industry, has been set up\nto find savings on research\nexpenditure. The Government is\nconcerned that there is insufficient\ncontrol of the money spent by the\nuniversities. In its review of all\nresearch and development\nprogrammes by Government\ndepartments, the committee will be\nconcentrating on the 'dual support\nsystem' by which the Advisory\nBoard for the Research Councils\nand the Universities Grants\nCommittee both channel money to\nuniversities for research.\nThe ABRC provides about \u00a3500\nmillion for research development.\nThe UGC provides \u00a3600 which pays\nfor academic salaries, buildings and\noverheads.\nSir David Phillips, chairman of\nthe ABRC and heading another\ninquiry into the UGC supplied\nmoney, said a Guardian interview\nthat they would have to find out\nwhat the \u00a3600 million pays for and\nhow much of it finds its way into the\nsupport of programmes which\nresearch councils are also\nsupporting. 'No one knows how the\n\u00a3600 million is- spent,' he\ncommented. He acknowledged that\nthe money could not be withdrawn\nwithout 'dramatic consequences',\nbut has already identified \u00a355\nmillion which is an easy target for\ntransfer; the amount of money given\nby the UGC to university\ndepartments which are successful in\nattracting research council giants.\nThe universities will fight\nrigorously any attempt to transfer\nmoney to the research councils as, if\nsuch a transfer occurred, research\ncouncils might decide to channel\nresearch money to polytechnics\ninstead of universities.\nIssue 750\n\n"

    "content": "ze lix FELIX, Friday October 17th198613 No More Bets Please\nBlackjack is THE -GAME for\nstudents of science and technology.\nIt combines the subjects of statistics, computing, extra-sensory\nperception and personal\npsychology. No matter how many\ncomputers you've got attached to\nyour left ankle. No matter how\nmany yards of computer printout\nyou've read from your personal\nCray 1\n1 (which is constantly\nanalysing Blackjack hands in your\nstudy bedroom) there is one\npowerful tip that I can give to all\npunters: if you find yourself hitting a bad losing streak - never chase your\nloss. Tomorrow is always another\nday. In the long term if you play\nBlackjack with the percentage in\nyour favour - you must come out on\ntop. The aim is to bet high when the\npercentage is in your favour and low\n(or not at all) when the percentage is\nagainst you. To be able to judge\nwhen the odds are in your favour it\nis essential to fully master the rules\nof the game.\nFour packs of cards are used and\nthese are dealt from a shoe (a box\nthat reduces the possibility of a 'crooked' dealer manipulating the\ndeck). Each player bets before\nseeing his two cards dealt face up by\nthe dealer. The dealer also deals one\ncard face up to herself.\nAs in Pontoon, the object of the\ngame is to get a total as near to 21 as\npossible without busting (getting a total of greater than 21). While a player's total is under 21, he may\nstand or draw a card. Players can\nsplit pairs, i.e. if the first two cards\ndealt to the player are the same then\nthe player can can put in a bet equal\nto his initial stake and play two split\nhands. The only restrictions are that\na player cannot split pairs of fours,\nfives and tens. If a player splits aces\nthen only one more card is dealt to\neach ace.\nThe other option is that a player\nmay double his stake if on the initial\ntwo cards he is dealt a 'hard' 9,10,11\ni.e. say a hard eleven made up oi a six and five. If a player opts to\ndouble then he is only dealt one\nmore card.\nA Blackjack is when the player or\ndealer gets a two card 21 made up of\na ten and an ace. (A ten can be a Jack, Queen or King). If the player\nis dealt a Blackjack, he receives a bonus of half his stake i.e. if he bet\n\u00a310, he gets \u00a315 plus his \u00a310 making\n\u00a325. A player can ask for\n'insurance', if he holds a Blackjack\nand the dealer shows an ace. If a player takes insurance he loses his\nbonus and gets paid even money.\nAt the end of each round, the\nplayers who have not bust compare\ntheir individual totals with that of\nthe dealer. If their total is greater\nthan the dealer's then they are paid\neven money. If their total equals the\ndealer's, it is a 'standoff and no\nmoney is lost or won on that-hand. If\none's total is less than the dealer's then one has lost. If the dealer busts\nthen all players who have not busted\nwin!\nFor readers who intend to write\ncomputer Blackjack simulation\nprograms there are a couple of\nobscure details that will complete\nthe picture.\nIf a player splits a pair of aces and\nis dealt a ten to one or both aces -this is not classed as Blackjack but is\na normal 21. If the dealer gets a Blackjack then the split bet is lost.\nA player can double on a hard\ntwo card 9,10 or 11 even after a split\ni.e. if a player splits a pair of eights\nand is dealt a three to the first and a two to the second 8, he can double\non both hands (an outlay of four\ntimes his initial stake). If he splits\neights and is dealt a10 to the first8 and a3 to the second eight, he can\nstill double his stake on the hand\nwhich is hard eleven.\nA Blackjack table is usually made\nup of seven boxes i.e. up to seven\nplayers can have individual hands (it\nis possible for players to share\nboxes). There is a rule that at least\ntwo boxes must be active - so if you\nare on your own at a Blackjack table\nyou will have to play two hands.\nThe minimum stake at Blackjack\nis normally \u00a35 but there are tables\nwhich offer \u00a31 or \u00a33 minimum\nduring the early evening (Casinos\nopen from 2 pm to 4 am every day\nexcept Saturday night when they\nclose at 2 am - an old tradition to\nallow punters to have time to get\nsome sleep ready to go to church on\nSunday).\nThe final and perhaps most\nimportant point of all is that\nalthough four decks of cards are\navailable - the last 30 cards in every\nshoe are \"dead\". A plastic marker is\ninserted at that point by the dealer.\nOnce the marker has been reached,\nthe final cards to complete the\nround are dealt and then all four\ndecks are shuffled and a player is\noffered the chance to cut the decks\nwith another plastic marker.\nStraight after the cut the cards are\nplaced in the shoe ready for a new\nseries of games.\nIf you've read this far, you know\nhow to play Blackjack. Now you\nneed to know how to win. The path\nto fortune lies in knowing when the\nodds are in your favour, and also\nmaking the right dec s ions on\nwhether to stand or draw,\ndepending on the state of the decks.\nThe number of high and low\ncards that are left to be dealt is the\nkey to estimating whether the odds\nare in your favour or the dealer's. If\nthere is a bias towards more high\ncards left then the dealer will bust\nmore often - and the odds are with\nthe player.\nIf there is a bias towards more\nsmall cards left then the odds are\nwith the dealer.\nA simple method of card\ncounting is to start your count from\nzero at a new shoe and add 1 every\ntime a2,3,4, or 5 is dealt and\nsubtract 1 every time a ten, Jack,\nQueen or King appears. Divide the\ncurrent total by the approximate\nnumber of decks left in the shoe, i.e. say there have been 104 cards dealt\n(2 decks) and you have a current\ncount of plus eight, the ratio is 8\ndivided by 2, 4. Suprisingly even a small positive ratio can swing the\nodds dramatically in the player's favour.\nMore sophisticated card counting\ncan be employed but I have found,\nafter several years of playing\nBlackjack, it is not important that\none has an accurate card count-more a general feel of how the shoe\nis progressing (this saves a lot of\nwork and improves one's enjoyment\nof the game). Also, hunches play an\nimportant part. If one is in tune with\nthe cards then profits come quickly,\nif one is tired or distracted then\nprofit can be difficult to obtain.\nA little bit of ESP and a lot of\npersonal psychology is a bonus, for\nthe player must recognise when he's tired or losing his sharpness.\nIt's not too difficult to become a member of a London casino. Simply\nvisit the casino of your choice (dress\nreasonably smart) and give the\nreceptionist your particulars.\nCasinos aim to \"elect ladies and\ngentlemen of good standing in\nsociety\". The consider students as\npotential big money earners and\nseem to ignore the fact that the\nmajority are carefully making their\ngrant last the term. Why not form a syndicate-even if you don't gamble,\nthe restaurants are very good and\nthe atmosphere is worth\nexperiencing. Membership is\nusually free. If elected to- the\nSporting Club you will be able to\ngamble 48 hours after registration.\nNever risk more than you can\nafford-and if you do make a profit\ntreat yourself to something\nspecial.\nby Colin Palmer\n(FELIX Editor 1979/80)\nA "

Reaction was instant, and\nan IC goal was in the air. After good\nwork from Simon Cole on the left,\nthe ball was volleyed home by Nigel\nCollier on the edge of the penalty\nbox. IC continued to dominate a scrappy and understandably tired\ngame, but UC regained the lead\nafter slack work on the IC right.and\nthe half-time score stayed at 2-1 to\nthe home team.\nThe industry of Simon Coel and\nFootball; Harlington: IC I5, KQC I1. Siege At\nHarlington\nNine KQC players and three on-loan IC players took on an IC I XI\non a balmy autumn afternoon at\nHarlington. This was the second\nfriendly of the season and an\nimportant one as IC was to do battle\nwith KQC in the first league outing\nof the season. IC dominated the first\nhalf but Laurence Covin's spectacular, curling free kick was\nthe only thing separating the teams\nat half time.\nIC'S attitude to the second half\nwas hungrier as they laid siege on\nthe KQC goal-clinical finishing by\nBill Mason, Bifron Wood, Dave\nLynne and Nigel Collier brought the\nscore to 5-0 KGC beat the off-side\ntrap once, 10 minutes from time,\nand duly brought the full-time score\nto 5-1.

Paul Olden put the visitor in\nfront when he tapped in a shot from\nthe ever present Nigel Collier. He\nlater completed his hat-trick with 15\nminutes to go.\nPraise must go to the already\nmentioned Coel and Olden, Nigel\nColier for his lethal finishing, and\nthe central defensive partnership of\nCovil and Paul Dyson who were\nsuperb in the second half.\nTeam: A Allen J West, L Covill, P Dyson, P Ewart, M Porter, D Olden,\nS Cole, A Lungi (Capt), D Lynne, N Collier, sub B Wood.\nLadies Rugby: Charing Cross Hospital 4, IC 28\nLadies' Day At\nCharing Cross\nLast Sunday was the first game of\nthe season for the Ladies' Rugby\nteam, and for three-quarters of the\nteam it was their first game ever.\nDespite this, IC rose to the challenge\nand ended up with a magnificent 28\npoints to four win.\nThe game started slowly with\nplayers finding their way and\ngaining confidence to tackle and run\nout the opposition. Then after 10\nminutes there was a scrum and\nscrum half Judith Day released the\nball to fly half Natalie Handler who\nmanaged to run through and pass\nthe opposition with a series of side\nsteps and swerves to lay down our\nfirst try. One more try was scored in\nthe first half.\nCharing Cross started the second\nhalf strongly and scored soon after\nkick off with a try down the wing.\nBut this recovery was short lived\nand IC managed to beat through\nfive tries in the second half. Tries\ncoming from Noreen Haninton,\nJudith Day and Natalie Handler\nagain. Well done to everyone for a great start to the season, especially\nall new players including the two\nnew centres. Fiona Nicholas and\nJackie Evans.\nNew players are always welcome\nin the Ladies' Rugby team, and no\nexperience is necessary but anyone\ninterested should contact Anne\nParsons, Mining Geology 3 or\nNatalie Handler, Bio Chem 3.\nSailing, Whitstable: IC vs\nKent University\nKent University\nSunk\nOn Sunday the IC Sailing team set\noff for the first match of the year.\nWe arrived at their sailing club to\nfind just two team members and five\nboats. Not to be deterred we\nsuggested two boat team racing with\nRichard Brinslow and Gareth\nDavid from IC Sailing for Kent.\nThe racing went well with IC\nwinning all races despite\ndeteriorating conditions as the tide\nwent out and the water around the\nbuoys got shallower causing a few\nrudder problems.\nRugby, away: IC 1st XV 17,\nUCL 1st XV 23\nIC 2nd XV 17, UCL 2nd XV 27\nIC Fall Back\nThe game was played in very hot\nconditions ideal for running rugby.\nIC scored first, a penalty try by\nAndy Watson which UCL replied to\nafter another few minutes. Rob\nHargrove went over for the first try of the season after a series of close-support passes, finishing with one\nfrom Andy Watson. UCL capitalised, but then Robin\nBannister went over on the wing for\na try. It was 13-7 to IC at half time.\nUCL capitalised after an\ninterception of a pass, then Mike\nAnderson scored after a tricky run\nfrom the 25 yard line to bring the\nscores to 17-13 in IC's favour. UCL\ndrew level after a long period of\npressure, and then their wing scored\na try, which was then converted\nmaking the score 23-17. The match\nwas scrappy as expected for their\nfirst match of the season, but\nprospects for the coming season\nlook good.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday October 17th198618 Gutterpress\nby S Leaze\nI sometimes think that the\nintroduction to a gossip column\nshould run something like a government health warning\u2014\n'Reading gossip can seriously\ndamage your view of reality'.\nUnfortunately, there is a twilight\nworld of un prove able information\nthat can't pass as news in the great\nand ancient tradition our editor\ndreams of upholding. However, if\nthere were no worth in 'official\nrumour' then most of the tabloid\npress would be bankrupt inside a week. The justification then for\n\"Gutterpress\" is essentially\neconomic rather than moral\u2014give\nthe p roles what they want.\nPast FELIX gossip columns have\nbeen especially keen on the\nwonderful College administration\nwho, based in the Sherfield building,\nare supposed to keep the place from\nfalling down around us as we work.\nIf you were to believe all you read\nthen you would surmise that what\nwe have is more of a combination of\nDallas and Yes Minister with\nCollege Secretary John Smith as\nsome sort of hybrid JR Ewing/Sir\nHumphrey figure and the Rector as\nan innocently by standing Minister.\nHowever the new Rector, Prof Ash,\nhas caused consternation among\nsome traditionalists by actually\nattacking Imperial's problems with\na strong personal commitment.\nFurthermore Mr Smith has been\nobserved being noticeably more\naffable toward students which is\nleading Smith watchers to believe\nsomething 'big' is brewing.\nAn interesting development in the\nsecretary saga is Mr Smith's new\nresidence, a flat in No 47 Princes\nGardens. This is one of the houses\nnext to Southside and many people\nhave wondered why it is not being\nconverted into more student\naccommodation. Well, the answer is\nthat Mr Smith's time at Imperial will\nnot continue forever; a year or two is\nthe unofficial estimate. When John\nSmith leaves it will be very difficult\nto find a replacement of a similar\ncalibre, and it is hoped that a South\nKensington home as a 'perk' will\nkeep suitably experienced outside\ncandidates in the running for the\njob. This will be seen as a great\ndisappointment to those young\nhopefuls already here who dream\nabout the seat of power and spend\nall their time edging themselves\ncloser to the vital South Corridor on\nthe 5th floor.\nSadly for some of the desk\ndwellers their efforts at ruthless\nefficiency have not made them\nuniversally popular. One such,\nrenowned for his pomposity to\nstudents, is ex-Student Services\nofficer and current assistant\nsecretary Michael Arthur. Mr\nArthur has long been known for\nemphasising his achievements,\nwhile lounging safely behind a desk,\nbut one achievement he is playing\ndown is his monumental cock-up of\nthe Queens Tower Tourist scheme\nthis summer. Strangely Michael is\nrarely invited to social gatherings\norganised by his ex-workplace, next\ndoor to Weeks hall. In fact he may\nnow have problems in Sherfield\nwhere he was caught relieving\nhimself behind a pot plant at a leaving party over summer.\nIt must be something about\nStudent Services which finally\ncracks people, as evidenced by\ncurrent boss Don Ferguson. Don is\nso strained by his workload that he\nspends long periods of time asleep\nbehind the closed door of his office,\nmuch to the consternation of the\nhard pressed counter staff. At least\nhe has not suffered the fate of\nofficial College pain in the neck and\nRag Chairman, Man Tai Tseung\nwho incurred the wrath of some of\nthe temporary staff during the start\nof term ac como dati on crisis. Man\nTai^ who was unsubtle enough to\nhave the college Welfare Advisor\ncovered in shaving foam, and who\nhas been described as having \"the\nsensitivity of a potato\", was locked\nin a cupboard for 15 minutes\nbecause nobody would talk to him.\nWell, it's a cruel world and this is a cruel column!\nLast week's problem\nI forgot to say that I wanted the year\nthat the old calender s come from as\nwell as the dates of the two\nbirthdays, which made the problem\nconsiderably harder.

    "content": "News\nKitchen Blues\nResidents of Tizard Hall have\nwritten to the Managing Surveyor of\nResidences, Mr Peter'Hallworth,\ncomplaining about the kitchen\narrangements in the Hall. They are\nconcerned that no improvements\nhave been made since September\n1985.\nLast year it was decided that the\nlaundry rooms of Tizard and\nSelkirk Halls would be converted to\nkitchens in order to reduce the\ncon jest ion in their existing facilities.\nMr Hallworth had originally\nintended to convert bedrooms on\neach staircase into kitchens and to\nconvert the existing kitchens into\nbedrooms. This plan was rejected by\nthe Tizard and Selkirk committees\nbecause of the disruption involved\nand because they felt that the\nkitchens would be noisy and smelly.\nFalmouth Keough Hall, however,\nelected to introduce the staircase\nkitchens. Members of Tizard and\nSelkirk committees have suggested\nthat Mr Hallworth is waiting for the\nresidents to be persuaded by the\nsuccess of the Falmout Keogh\nfacilities. The Tizard committee still\nrejects this idea as it would involve\neither turning students out of their\nrooms or delaying the kitchens for\nanother year.\nBroken\nWindow\nStudents from Richmond College\nhave been banned from using IC\nUnion rooms following rowdy\nbehaviour in the Union Lounge.\nThe College, which is for American\nand other overseas students, had\nbooked the room for a \"Hawaiian\nBeach Party\" last Friday. Several\ncomplaints were received about\nnoise, including one from Dr\nFinlay, the Warden of Beit Hall,\nwhich resulted in the party being\nclosed half an hour early.\n\"The students brought in a lot of\nalcohol and left a great deal of\nmess,\" said Deputy President,\nJackie Pierce, adding that the bar\nstaff were considering closing the\nbar because of their drunken\nbehaviour.\nLater in the evening one of the\nstudents threw a bottle through a window in Biochemistry, and more\ndisturbance was caused when they\nwere left waiting in Beit Quad for\nthree-quarters of an hour when one\nof their coaches failed to arrive on\ntime.\nThe cost of replacing the window\nof \u00a330 will be taken from Richmond\nCollege's deposit.\nFamine Talk\nMary Wright, a field worker for\nThird World First spoke on 'The\ntrue causes of famine' at their\nmeeting last Friday. Mrs Wright\nexplained that exploitation of good\nsoil for the growth of cash crops,\nsuch as tea, by multinationals was\npushing peasants out onto more\nmarginal land. She commented that\noverpopulation was not such a large\nproblem as it had been made out to\nbe and that Third World countries\ncould feed themselves if they were\nallowed to control their own\nresources. \"For a subject as\nimportant as this, it was\ndiss a pointing that the meeting was\nso poorly publicised and attended\",\nsaid one observer.\nUniversity\nFunding\nThe Committee of Vice-Chancellors\nand Principals is urging the\ngovernment to act to halt the decline\nin universities' funding. The\ncommittee is also pressing for higher\nsalaries for academics \"We realise\nthat we can't mean competitive\nsalaries, but we mean a reasonable\nsalary\", they stated. Professor\nMaurice Shock, chairman of the\ncommittee, said that funding of\nuniversities would drop by one-third in this decade if nothing was\ndone. As a result not only is the\neducation of prospective students\nthreatened but also the future of\nBritain's basic research-a main\npurpose of the universities. Prof\nShock warned that in the end \"the\nmedical schools which underpin the\nhealth service will slowly decay.\"\nSalary increase and res turing the\nacademic profession would cost\n\u00a3170 million, while stab lising university funding at 1986/87 levels\nwould require a further \u00a380-130\nmillion.\nAphrodisiac Teas\nThe Union Snack Bar Manager\nNorman Jardine has introduced a new range of 'a phr osd is iac teas'.\n\"Ordinary tea is slow suicide\",\nexplained a very laid back customer,\nhis eyes still dilating from a cup of\n.'orange dazzle r'. In an exclusive FELIX interview,\nNorman pointed out that he had\nalways wanted to introduce unusual\nteas, but has only recently found a reasonably priced supplier. He\nreckons that the novel teas will\nprove very popular, especially after\nthe recent articles in the Guardian\nand Standard which extolled their\nvirtues.\nVideo Art\nThe University of London's interactive video network 'Live-net'\nwas unveiled on Monday at a demonstration in the Sherfield\nBuilding. It was hoped that the\nsystem, a prototype of a British\nTelecom design, will be fully\noperational by October 1987,\nenabling intercollegiate seminars\nand conferences to take place.\nThe network allows simultaneous\naudio visual communication on a maximum of four channels so that\nfive way conversations can take\nplace 'over the television'. At the\nmoment Imperial College, Senate\nHouse and University College have\nlinks to the network, and King's and\nQueen Mary Colleges are due to be\nconnected by the end of November.\nAt present the tea is only sold at\nlunch times. Four flavours are\navailable with more on the way,\n'orange dazzle r' being the most\nsought after. Norman can vouch for\nthe tea's aphrodisiac qualities from\nhis own personal experience. \"Since\nI started drinking it I 've been up all\nthe time\", he said.\nMore\nSabbaticals\nOn The Way\nA working party has been set up to\nconsider increasing the number of\nsabbatical posts. In her report to\ncouncil on Monday, Union Deputy\nPresident Jackie 'Pence suggested\nthat five full-time officers were\nneeded now that the Union Snack\nBar and Union Bar are under Union\ncontrol.\nRector's Wife\nOpens Lift\nMrs Eric Ash, the Rector's wife,\nopened a new passenger lift in\nBiochemistry last Friday. This lift\nreplaces the old paterno ster system\nof continually moving platforms, on\nwhich a man was killed last year.\nThe lift installation was carried out\nby ERS Lift and Elevators Ltd\nunder the supervision of Mr John\nJames who is the Electrical Engineer\nat IC.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday October 17th19868 A Sick University\nby\nDavid Rowe\nFELIX Editor 1984/5\nYou must known that Imperial\nCollege is a swamp of fear and\nloathing. The year is 1994, the\n1000th issue of FELIX has just\nthudded on your doormat; it is the\nbeginning of another Friday at the\nsick university.\nSuccessive administrations by\napplication of the principles of\ncaring capitalism have eroded state-funded education almost entirely.\nThe Science and Engineering\nResearch Council exist to distribute\nfunds from industry now, not from\ngovernment. The SERC looks for\nglamorous research fields,\nover funds them for a few years, and\nthen transfers the funding\nelsewhere. Academics are\nconstantly changing their research\nfields to make them appear more\nglamourous. Erstwhile collaborators now take evil pleasure in\nThe Senior Assistant\nUndersecretary for Data\nProcessing\nsabotaging one another's work.\nProjects rarely get completed.\nThings are not much better in the\nold Sherfield building either. True,\nthe administrators are still funded\nby the government but they haven't escaped unscathed.\nJob titles are changed nearly\nevery week to fit in with the latest\nbuzzwords (and to justify the\ncontinued employment of Jack, the\nman who paints people's names on\ntheir doors).\nNo one dares to exchange\npleasantries in the corridor, or reply\nto letters for fear that it will be\nthought that they don't have enough\nwork to do.\nOffice juniors hope to obtain\npromotion by writing to the Rector\nto tell him that they can do their own\njob plus that of their boss 'and\nwouldn't it be a good idea to....' The\nadministration responds by\nchanging the boss's job title, moving\nhim sideways, and giving him\nnothing to do in the hope that he will\nget fed up and go away. People don't resign or get sacked. They just drift\naway.\nOf course most of the power in\nthe Sherfield building lies with the\ndata processing manager, or\n'principal second secretary with\nresp on sibi lit iy for information\nsystems'. The administration thrives\non disinformation, half-truths and\ndownright lies, most of which are\ncirculated by electronic means, from\none department to another. The\ndata processing department adds to\nthe fun by 'losing' parts of the data\nfrom time to time. Vast armies of\ntemporary secretaries are then\nengaged by the person el department\nto type all the data in again.\nIn a rare stroke of genius the\nrefectory was closed down last year,\nand a franchise awarded to\nMacDonald's(' a long established\nfamily firm with a fine tradition of\nsponsorship of research in the\nartificial food faculty') The old\nrefectory staff have been redeployed\non the Star Wars project.\nThe assistant third secretary\n(exploitation of American tourists)\nhas had the tunnels under the\nCollege renovated at a cost of \u00a365\nmillion. 'See the tower and the\ntunnels for an all-in, once-and-for-all, unrepeatable \u00a325.'\nAs the administration has grown\nlarger and larger it has been deemed\nnecessary for more and more of the\nsenior staff to be found flats and\naccommodation on campus. Pairs\nof rooms in Southside have been\nknocked into one to make flats for\nadministrators; the demand for\nthese rooms is so great that there are\ninteresting plans to build a new hall\nof residence, possibly to be sited on\ntop of the sports centre in Princes\nGardens.\nAlarmed by this prophetic vision\nof the future, dear student? No need\nto be. The teaching of\nundergraduates has been farmed\nout to private contractors at\nCranfield. Students have no place in\nthe sick university.\nA LOAD OF CRAP Mike Llewellyn-Williams\n(Editor 1974/75) wastes\nsome ink\nDear Mr. Editor,\nYes indeed, I see your problem\nonly too clearly. Poor you. FELIX\nissue no. 750 on the horizon and\ndoo d ly squat of interest to publish.\nSo you've contacted lots of Exeditors to bail you out with self-indulgent drivel that should never\nsee the light of day. You poor\nmiserable bugger.\nHas it never dawned on you that\nex-Editors of FELIX cannot be\ntrusted within half-a mile of pen\nand paper any more? That the\nmerest sniff of a copy deadline is\nenough to send them stark staring\nbonkers? So that they start\nrepeating themselves? Repeating\nthemselves?\nAnd sometimes they start to think\nthey are two people! (Both of us are\nquite adamant about this).\nThat's when the exclamation\nmarks start appearing out of the!\nblue!.\nThen the spelling in the ar tyke lsch tart z te diz inter grate two.\nZo, wee both! feal that went he es happen z yoo s hood eggs er cize y or rites as a need it tor and! stop these elly sos sage from! finish e eng his sent en Hugh Southey (Editor\n1985/86) writes about\nbeing a fruitcake\nFour months ago Dave Jones asked\nme to write something on a topic of\nmy choice to celebrate the 750th issue. Sounds easy doesn't it? It isn't though. When you have the\nopportunity to write about anything\nnothing seems appropriate.Dave\nsuggested that I should write about\nbeing engaged. I am sure most of\nyou don't want to be bored by a slushy tribute to your Deputy\nPresident (she is wonderful you\nknow). Anyway those of you who\nwere here last year when I was\nEditor will have read enough boring\ndrivel in my editorials so I 'll keep it\nshort. I'd just like to say that I'm pleased that FELIX has managed\n750 issues. I hope it manages to stay\nas the most readable publication at\nIC for another 750 issues. It is very\nsatisfying to see 4000 copies\ndisappear on Friday morning.\nFinally I hope Dave hides this\narticle somewhere so that nobody\nreads it.\nKeep the Cat Free\nHugh.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday October In celebration of 750 glorious issues of FELIX, we present a selection of ramblings for past editors.\nDave Griffin rolls back the years and finds\nthe English language corrupted by Uncle\nSam\nAs the 750th appearance of the Cat\ncomes and goes, I have, as one of\nthe early Editors, fallen to\npondering on the changes that have\ntaken place since those dim and\ndistant days of the mid-50s, when\ncopy was typed upon manual\ntypewriters and pasted up on\nboards for the Polish photo litho printer in Earl's Court that we had\nforbidden to 'correct' the English\nin the copy, even if he was sure it\nwas wrong.\nOne sort of change that might\nbecome apparent if one compares\nthe early issues with the present-sad\nto relate, I do not have an example\nof either to hand-is the change in\nvocabulary. Who would have\nknown in the 1950s what was meant\nby 'macho' 'rip off 'go-go\"freebies'\n'ID', or would have given 'gay' its\ncurrent meaning. If I'd heard tell of\na campus then, I would not have\nbeen sure what it was, but I would\nhave known it was something to do\nwith an American University\u2014this\nwas of course before universities like\nEast Anglia were built, each having\nits own 'campus'. Yes, all these\nwords have started life somewhere\nwest of Galway Bay and have since\ncrossed the Atlantic and made their\nhome here too. The colonialists\nhave colonised, and are still doing\nso.\nYet there are many Americanisms\nthat have not (yet?) made the\njourney, such as bathroom (for\ntoilet)or rain check( a promise of the\nsame thing at another time),\nalthough they are beginning to be\nheard over here\u2014I suppose Dallas\nand Dynasty, not to mention\ncomputer speak, have their\ninfluences. And others that\nprobably never will, since there are\nalready well-established British\nEnglish words that offer too much\ncompetition, one hopes or perhaps\none should say hopefully (another\none that has been naturalised since\nthe '50s): to mind come the well\nknown pairs 'railroad/railway',\n'elevator/lift' and 'vest/waistcoat',\nor the lesser known 'ride/lift' (in the\nhitchhiking sense), 'raise/rise' (of\nsalaries) and 'faucet/tap' (where\nwater comes out)\nFELIX Editor 1956/57\nMost confusion I find are the\nwords that mean different things on\neach side of the pond\u2014vest is one of\nthem, but a well publicised example.\nNot so purse (meaning the whole\nhandbag, not just the money\ncontainer), dormitory (the building\nwhere one sleeps, typically what we\nwould call a 'hall of residence'), fag\nand faggot (homosexual)-leading to\nconfusing perhaps less for us over\nhere than for Americans over here in\nthe context of cigarettes, public\nschools and chopped meat\nconcoctions)! Also, you have to be\nvery careful not to be misunderstood if you tell an American to\nkeep his pecker up or to ask him to\nlend you his rubber!\nAs a regular visitor to the USA, I arrive at Chicago O 'Hare airport on\na Seven-Forty-Seven airplane,\ncollect my luggage from the carousel\nand put it on a cart, then, after\nimmigration and Customs, collect\nthe rented automobile (naturally it\nwill be with no gearshift and will\nhave an Illinois license plate), throw\nmy luggage in the trunk, check that\nthere is enough gas in the tank,\nobserve that the windshield is clear\n(there are only a couple of decals on\nit) and that the muffler is not blown,\nback up to come out of the parking\nspot and drive off. I get up on the\ntollway and head north. But it's slow going since the pavement is\nunder repair, made worse by the\npresence of a number of semis in the\nline I'm in. But things soon clear and\nI can hit 55, the national speed limit.\nBefore long I stop at an oasis where I visit the bathroom and perhaps grab\na brat and a soda (but certainly not\nany root beer!)\nAt Rockford, Illinois I look into\nthe Time Museum attached to a motel just off the interstate, and am\ngratified to see among the books in\nthe museum shop a couple of titles\n(on astronomy) by another former\nFELIX Editor, my contemporary\nRobin Kerrod. I eventually reach\nthe beltway of Madison, Wisconsin\n(The beltway is of course a divided\nhighway, i.e.a highway with a median) and head for downtown. I might be stopping in a university\ndorm or may be visiting with friends\nin their condo that they have just\nbrought not too near a railroad\ncrossing. They come nt that their\nrealtor was 'real good' (pun?!), and\npoint out that the yard had been in a well-cared for state when they had\nmoved in.\nI 've now ceased to be puzzled at\nthe terminology of classifying\nundergraduates according to where\nthey are in the four(!) years of their\ncourse of study as freshmen (never\n'Freshers'), sophomores, juniors\nand seniors or at the system of\nassistant, as s soci ate, and full\nprofessors (where we have lecturers,\nreaders and professors); the term\nfaculty (to signify the university\nteaching staff) has I think now\nsuccessfully made the crossing. I am\nstill a little confused about\nsemesters-in theory, the two halves\ninto which the academic year is\ndivided, as compared with our three\nterms, but they seem to have\nsummer session in addition.\nWhat takes a bit of getting used to\nis the different pronunciation of\nseveral words-not the different\n'accent' but a difference within their\nframework of sound values as\ncompared with what we say in our\nparallel system (is this what the\nlinguists would call a difference in\nphone ms as opposed to\nall o phones?). Well known ones are\n'tomatoes' (rhyming with 'potatoes'\nand 'either' (rhyming with 'ether'),\nbut also 'solder', which is\npronounced 's odder', a herb is an\n'er b' and 'basil'-is 'base-ill'.In\nproper names, 'Elgin' becomes\n' Elj in' and 'Brynmawr' is\n'Brinmore' (for the non-Welsh\namong you, it should be\npronounced 'Brin-ma-o or'!) these\nare places in the USA, presumably\ncalled after the originals over here.\nOf course the French must really\nsquirm when they hear the places\n'Des Plaines' and 'Notre Dame'\npronounced as English words, but\nthere is a nod in the Freeh direction\nwith 'Des Moines' which is said to\nrhyme with 'sirloin'; however,\nanyway it's been a very long time\nsince the French heard 'Detroit '\nsaid as it org in ally was (de trio t)' Then there is the changing stress\nin words such as a dull, where we say\nadult, and /Moratory\nAlso, the subtle changes in the use\nof words, such as using a verb\ntransitively where we would use it\nintra s it iv ely, like 'protest' they say\n'The students protest the cut in\ngrants'. As a matter of fact, we too\nuse 'protest' their innocence, but\nover there they protest their\nconviction!\nAnd the different use of\nabbreviations; chrysanthemums are\nmums, whereas 'refrigerator' is not\nabbreviated-but you often hear it\ncalled what it once was: the icebox;\nand a cooker is always a stove.\nBut I could go on (this is a750 th issue guest corner not a series) OK,\nsuffice to recall what Mark Twain is\nsaid to have remarked on being told\nthat American was a mere\naberration of English; 'The King's English is not the King's. It is a joint stock company and America owns\nmost of the shares'.\n\n"
