    "content": "Reviews\nSuperman III Now playing Warner West\nEnd and most ABCs.\nThree is the lucky number. We've had\nRocky III, Friday 13th III and Star Wars\nIII; we are in the age of the sequel. When\nstudios can no longer afford the services of\ntitle writers and ad-men to convince you\nthat a new title is really old familiar\nground, more of the same, we get a surfeit\nof sequels. So having come straight out with\nit, and not tried to dress mutton up as lamb,\nthe punter hopes to see something new,\nunfortunately the same tired old plot is\nground out again.\nSo I'm please to say that Superman III\ndoes contain some exciting surprises.\nHaving disposed of terrestrial and extraterrestrial foes in human form, what can\nthere be left for our man of steel to\nconfront? Yep, right first time, wheel out\nthe psychotic cyber naut, a machine with a highly developed instinct for self-preservation and some other pretty\nClark Kent getting ready for work,\ndisgusting habits.There are also a number of\nhuman baddies bent on beating his brains\nout.Chief nasty is Robert Vaughn who is\nacting as Ross Webster, a man who is so\nrich that he doesn't wear the same pair of\nsocks twice! He wants to take over the\nworld for no particularly good reason,\nexcept that he can then forget about tax\nlawyers. Our erstwhile man from UNCLE\nobviously enjoyed his role as villain.\nPamela Stephenson plays his overburdened mistress Lorelei Ambrosia, a neat\nlittle part played with nice timing by one of\nour best comediennes.\nApart from Lorelei and the perennial\nLois Lane, another attractive distraction\nfor Superman to cope with is Lana Lang\nplayed by Annette O 'Toole. I'm sure her\nturn at stardom is not far away.\nPage lOH HH Mn HMM Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it a hairpiece?\nFor me though, Richard Pryor stole the\nshow, for all the gadgetry, jigger y poker y and special effects and despite a fairly\nmodest role one felt that the rest of the cast\nwere playing off him, taking their'leads\nfrom this brilliant comic. The delicacy\nwhich he brought to his most manic\nmoments was delightful. Rescued from the\nobscurity of f he dole queue by an\nunexpected ability to talk to computers he\nis swept along by the pace of events he\ncreates.\nOn a tongue in cheek scale, this film sits\nsomewhere between Bond and Batman,\neffective but not self-indulgent. Perhaps the\nonly criticism that could be levelled at the\nfilm is the pace which drags a bit in places,\nand the apocalyptic a la Bond climax was\nrather a damp s qui b but carping aside this\nis a marvelous film, brought to life by the\ncomic talents of Richard Pryor and the\nundoubted hunk y ness of Christopher\nReeve.\nWith a month or two's running behind it,\nMonty Python's Meaning of Life, on\ngeneral release, isn't exactly a recent\nrelease. If you haven't seen it yet you\nprobably haven't the slightest intention of\ngoing, but in case there are some waver ers out there may I be allowed a word of\nexplanation.\nThe Meaning of Life is possibly the first\nfilm aimed at the fish market, after all, there\nare more fish than people. It has been\nplaying at packed houses at Smithfield.\nThus it cd hf a in s some scenes which might\nbe disturbing for non-aquatic life-forms. If\nyou can swallow this basic premise, the rest\nis easy enough to cope with. The film takes\nthe form of a series of sketches which are\nroughly hung round the skeleton of the\njourney from the cradle to the grave. It\nevolved as a series of sketches and a few\nlinks were thrown in for good measure, a format familiar to devotees of the television\nseries.I found the sketches savagely funny\nand in quite appallingly bad taste,and have\nno hesitation in recommending it to anyone\nof hardy constitution.\nLast and by all means least we come to\nNational Lampoon's Class Reunion (15)\ndirected by Michael Miller. Playing in a double bill with Young Doctors in Love it\nmakes that title appear a paragon of wit\nand good taste.\nClass Reunion has little to do with\n-Animal House, retaining few of the\noriginal cast and none of the affectionate\nhumour. It is an attempt at a horror spoof.\nOne of the class is planning revenge for past\nabuse by his classmates and traps them in\nthe school and sets about picking them off\none by one.\nA promising idea, but it simply doesn't work. The tedious overdone stereotype\nbecame impossible to believe in and as the\nkiller gets stuck into his programme of\nrevenge, you hope that he will indeed\nsucceed in wiping out the rest of the cast\nwithout further delay and bring the whole\ntawdry tale to a swift conclusion. To say\nthat it was without humour would be an\nex agger tai on, but so would be saying that\nanyone actually laughed. Only to be taken\nif in an advanced state of alcoholic\nparalysis.\nLee Paddon\nGraham Chapman in heaven.\n\\ Felix\n\n"

Not only has the Union's extensive collection of used\ncardboard boxes and old files\nbeen thrown out but also the\nchairs have actually been cleaned.\nAfter attending the SUSOC\nknitting conference I understand\nthat Christine Teller has decided\nthat it would be cheaper to knit\nthe next set of Union curtains. I would not be surprised to learn\nthat the unusual size of Jo\nHewanicka's new desk just\nhappens to coincide with the\nlatest Woman's Realm dress\npattern.\nI have even heard rumours\nthat the dynamic duo have\ndecided a new colour scheme for\nthe Union Office using a Laura\nAshley Bedroom design.\nI would be the last person to\nsuggest that they have the Union\nsewn up, but next year's officers\nmay well sport matching Shetland\njumpers.\nI remain, yours sincerely,\nStephen Goulder\nIC Union Decorator\nNo nook ie Dear Ed\nI have been here a year now.\nAnd everything has turned out\nquite well. There is everything\nhere a man could want, other\nmen that is. But for myself...well\n...eight years at a public school\nhas left me rather sore about\nthat sort of thing. The masters\nwere so demanding.\nIt's not that the lack of women\ndisappoints me. No, it's the lack\nof action by the Union Executive.\nYou would have thought with all\nthis knowledge and expertise of\nthis centre of academic scientific\nexcellence we could make some\nof our own. Women that is.\nYours\nFrustrated of Beit\nPage 21\nLtttm-fr-th?-Emote s If\nPot Plant\nDear Sir\nIn my perusal of the Postgraduate\nFELIX a certain photograph\n(p5) grasped my eye. In the\naforementioned picture the\nformer champagne swilling,\ncigar smoking President Stephen\nGoulder is seen passing over the\nPresidential cannabis pouch\n(presumably filled) to his\nsuccessor. I think that such a tradition is disgraceful in a latter-day student union which is\nsupposed to be the forefront of\nthe students of IC.\nAny person off the street when\nseeing this photograph would\nget the impression that all\nstudents can afford cigars,\nchampagne and dope.\nYours faithfully\nMichael Newperson\nPS: I have sent copies to\nMargaret Thatcher, HM The\nQueen, the Archbishop of\nCanterbury and Mr Richard\nIngrams.\nThe on we had\nto print\nDear Pallab\nI would like to take this\nopportunity of wq i shing you\nluck with your organ in the\ncoming year, I'm sure that, in\naddition to the wit and inventiveness you will bring to the\npaper, you will maintain the\nhigh standards of production we\nhave come to expect. I look\nforward to raid nga fun newspaper free from technical err ers. Yours sincerely\nDave Jaded\nPorno Pallab\nDear Pallab\nIn my recent sojourn of the\nFELIX Office I have noticed\nthat it has degenerated into a den of iniquity and vice. Pornographic magazines can be seen\nlying about the tables and chairs\nat sporadic intervals, God\nknows how many are in the\nEditor's Office. Not only this,\ncertain people of dubious\nnatures have been entering your\nupstairs office with you and\nreturning at a much later\ninterval in time. The corrupting\ninfluence is self-evident if even\nAnti-Porn Crusader Michael\nNewman can be drawn into this\nweb of vice. You must clean the\noffice up.\nPS: I 'll do the decorating.\nC Burgess\nPhysics 2\nTeller Tells All\nDear Pallab\nThrough the pages of your\naugust journal. I feel I must give\nvent to my feelings of\noverwhelming bewilderment at\nworking in an office of foreign\nsabbaticals. I have tried teaching\nthem esperanto, sign language\nand having them subtitled but all\nto no avail. The problem is\ncompounded by the Polish\ninclinations of the Union\nreceptionist who has a propensity\nfor gabbling incoherently on the\nphone.\nI have found the only solution\nis to hold long and meaningful\nconversations with my filing\ncabinets whilst counting large\namounts of small change through\nthe coin counter, possibly the\nonly machine in the office\ncapable of competing with the\nverbal garbage emanating form\nthe surrounding sabbaticals.\nChris Teller\nDeputy President\nDressing Down\nDear Pallab\nI wish to protest most strongly\nabout the deplorable drop in\nstandards of dress and appearance by this year's Exec. After\nthe cultured, dashing, debonair\nStephen Goulder, this year's Exec are a real shambles.\nIt wouldn't be so bad if one of\nthem wasn't so gorm less and the\nother didn't have a face like a horse.\nYours sincerely\nM McKenna\nGrim Prospects\nDear Pallab\nI would like to complain most\nstrongly about the quality of this\nyear's IC Prospectus. Not only\nhas the cover been changed - how\nare people to recognise it, I ask -but some of the oldest and most\ntreasured photos have been\nomitted. Ever since my arrival six\nyears ago I have kept pinned to\nmy wall a copy of the 1950s photo\nof a young man happily playing a guitar as a model for my own\nbehaviour. To whom are today's fresher s expected to look for\nguidance?. It's no wonder the\nplace is going to the dogs.\nYours outraged\nAloysius J Spriggs\nHorse Rubbish\nSir\nYour present campaign against\nChris Teller is disgraceful. Some\nof the things you have said in the\ncourse of it are tantamount to\nsuggesting that not only does\nChris have a face like a horse but\nthat Chris is a lady as well. Both\nthese charges are as false as they\nare disgraceful. Mind you, I couldn't help laughing.\nYours etc\nKenneth Wagg\nHorse face\nI Felix\n\n"

    "content": "OF\nCHEAPSKATE\n'Ah me, What am I to do now?' thought\nSmarty Saylor aloud to himself as he lay\nawake in his bed. In two days time he would\nbe both unemployed and homeless, for then\nit would be July the 1st. Instead of being the\nfamous and influential FELIX Editor, he\nonce was, he would return to being an\nordinary person.\n'I 'll have to get a job, I suppose,' he\nmuttered, though he quailed at the\nthought. 'And a roof over my head. It\nmight be easier if I wasn't such a whining ninny, but no-one in their right\nmind would have anything to do with\nme.'\nSmarty felt the beginnings of a hangover\nthrobbing in his skull. His eyes rolled like\ngritty marbles and the room\u2014his for such a short time now\u2014began to gyrate around\nhim. Faces familiar and strange swam\nbefore his eyes. 'That third pint of ginger\nbeer I had last night was one too many,' he\ngroaned as he sank into a faint.\n'Abracadabra.' Smarty was rudely\nawakened by Arthur Michael, the Good but\nNot Very Helpful Fairy. Smarty rubbed his\neyes in amazement, but the apparition\nshowed no signs of disappearing. His room\nand cosy bed we*e gone! Instead he was\nlying on the floor of an unfamiliar office.\n'Where am I?' he whined plaintively.\nArthur Michael, for his part, was not\nhaving a very good day. Life as a Fairy on\nBaron Weed's staff was bad enough without\nhaving to deal with whining, ineffectual\nninnies at this time in the morning.\n'You're in the land of Cheapskate, ducky,\nevey one knows that'. The fairy tried the\nmagic word once more.\n'Agotablacbra,' he pronounced with a negligent wave of the hand. Nothing\nhappened.\n'Oh, how am I expected to do this on my\nFelix \u2022 \u2022 HH BH HM RH HH HH HH HI By\nJuvenal\nown?' he whimpered with a little stamp of\nhis foot.\n'If only I had aids!' He stood one arm\nakimbo as, with a jaunty flick of the hips,\nhe went on. 'I simply must turn these two\ninto ones, you know, but it can be very\nhard, especially if they don't want to go.' He\neyed Smarty with a new interest.\nSmarty, evading his stare, loftily\nannounced, Two into one wont' go.' He was\nconfident when dealing with such small\nnumbers.\n'Oh, I don't know about that,' mused\nArthur.\n'I'm thinking of putting five into the double\nrooms in the Linstead extension.'\n'Lauwerys' Arthur tired another magic\nword.\n'Can you find a room for me?' begged\nSmarty. 'I 've just arrived in your Land of\nCheapskate and I really need somewhere to\nstay. Only you can help me.'\nArthur kicked Smarty in the private parts.\n(He had a surprisingly hard kick for a fairy.)\n'Let that be a lesson to you,' he shrilled. 'I 've\ngot far more important things to do than\nhelp ordinary people. Why, only this\nafternoon I 've got to get ready and look my\nbest for Lady Marigold's garden party.\nNIGEL!!!' he shrek ed, 'What have you done\nwith my hairspray?'\nComposing himself he added, 'The\nBaron's sidekick, John Secretary, will be\nthere and one has to suck up to him if one\nwants to get on in the Baron's staff,' he\nfinished with a knowing glance.\n'But you're paid to help ordinary people,'\nsqueaked Smarty in a funny high voice as he\nwrithed on the floor.\nArthur looked at him suffering and a strange g let.. Ti came into his eye.\n'Well, there's Evelyn Gardens, they've got\never so many rooms there. Though, of\ncourse, you might have to share. And then\nthere are the silverfish, and the odd\ncockroach, the plumbing...of course, if\nyou'd like to stay here...' he minced over to\nSmarty and helped him to his feet.\n'Evelyn Gardens,' Smarty groaned\nthrough gritted teeth and staggered out of\nthe office as fast as his weakened legs could\ncarry him.\nWhere will Arthur Michael put his foot\nnext?\nWill John Secretary mind?\nWhich insects and vermin will Smarty\nfind in Evelyn Gardens?\nIs John Thole the most overpaid,\npompous, stuck-up, employee of Imperial\nCollege?\nFind out in the next thrilling episode of\n'The Baron of Cheapskate'.\nin burgh est i val Fringe\nDramsoc are previewing one of the four\nplays they are taking to the Edinburgh\nFringe this year.\nBetween Time and Timbuktu will be\nperformed in the Union Building tomorrow\n(Saturday) at 8:00pm, admission is free.\nThe play, a late '60s TV film by Kurt\nVonnegut Jr, is a tongue-in-cheek, science-fiction odyssey.\nA poet, Stoney Stevenson, wins a competition and the prize is a astronaut\ntraining crash course, and time-warp trip\nthrough the 'Chronosynclastic Infundibulum'. He sees '60s visions of the future:\nover-population, religious persecution, state\noppression, suspended animation and\nterrorism.\nit LThe directors, Mike Thackray and Colin\nCooper, have transformed these dated\n'world problems' into a very funny play for\nthe '80s. Dramsoc's usual technical skills\ncombine with excellent character acting to\nproduce an hour packed with excitement.\nThe other plays Dramsoc will be\nper fo ming at the Fringe are: What do you\nsay before you say goodbye by Melody\nShahan, about sex politics; Songs, Sonets\nand Satyre by John Donne and co, a dramatic anthology of metaphysical verse,\nand Purple Forest Extravaganza a collection of music, mime and drama,\nfeaturing Twelve Cubic Feet and Melting\nMoments.\nIf you are in Edinburgh in August or\nSeptember they are performing under the\nname 'Beit Theatre' at St John's Church,\nWest End, right on Princes Street.\nColin Cooper\nff\n\n"

    "content": "Union\nOverseas Students Fees\nSome of you may realise that a judgement made at the House of\nLords last December may affect\nyour classification as an overseas\nstudents. A change was made in the\ndefinition of 'ordinary residence'\nwhich will affect the fees you have\nto pay, ie overseas or home student\nrates. The judgement could affect\nyour classification for the 1982/3\nacademic session.\nPreviously, the Department of\nEducation and Science would not\ncount periods spent in higher\neducation as ordinary residence in\nthe UK, however this situation has\nnow changed. But there are a number of loopholes in the regulations so don't get too hopeful.\nAt present the situation is: if you\nbelieve you were incorrectly classified as an overseas student\nduring the session 1982/3, you\nshould write to the College Registrar ( Mr P Mee) formally,\nmaking this point, briefly stating\nthe grounds lor your claim and\nindicating the amount of fees you\nhave paid. The deadline for the\nofficial notification is 31 August\n1983. If College believe you are\nlikely to be in this situation you\nshould have received notification\nby mail.\nII anybody wishes to come and\ntalk to me to discuss their class if ica tion, please do so as soon as possible, I hope I can be of some help.\nI should also add that under the\nterms of the new Education (Fees\nand Awards Act, which has applied\nfrom 1 July 1983, all periods spent\nin education will be excluded from\nthe establish e ment of three years\n'ordinary residence'. Therefore you\nmay still be classified as an overseas\nstudent for the 1983/4 session.\nIt is vital that if you wish to make\na claim concerning classification\nthat you notify College by 31\nAugust, otherwise your claim will\nnot be valid.\nGrants\nAs a general matter of interest. The\nLondon Student grants for the\n1983/4 session will be: Under graduate \u00a3 1,975; Postgraduate\n^2,995.\nGaynor Lewis\nPG Tips\nChris Hendy, this year's Postgraduate Affairs\nOfficer discusses the\nPostgraduate Group and\nits activities. He gives a brief resume of last\nyear's academic issues\nand the group's social\nactivities.\nDue to increasing apathy amongst\nits members, the Postgraduate\nGroup at Imperial has, in recent\nyears, seen a decline in its activities.\nI hope this year to see more active\nsupport, instead of leaving all the\nwork to the committee. We'll give\nyou as much support as you give us.\nThe main academic issues raised\nlast year were, the status of the\nDiploma of Imperial College (DIC)\nand the registering of writing up\nstudents as part time.\nPage G1H HH HM I The DIC situation has hopefully\nbeen resolved, the awarding of an\nalternative advanced study certificate to those who fail to complete\ncourse requirements shelved. As far\nas the position regarding writing\nup students is concerned. I 'll be\nhonest in being somewhat ignorant.\nI am however investigating the\nsituation and would be grateful for\nany details of problems that writing\nup students have experienced.\nAn important point for those of\nyou who have worked between\nschool and college and/or college\nand starting postgraduate studies.\nYou may be eligible for extra\nmoney from your gra\u00abt awarding\ncouncil\u2014it's worth checking.\nAs yet I have been unable to\nform a full committee and am\nlooking for volunteers to stand for\nvarious posts. Compared to the\nbenefits that can be gained the\neffort required is minimal, so if you\nare at all interested please see me as\nsoon as possible.\nSocial events for the coming year\nwill commence with the Ploughman's Lunch on October11, tickets will be available during the\nfirst week of term. A couple of\nbrewery trips have also been\narranged before Christmas. If there\nis sufficient interest I should also\nlike to see foot fj all and darts\nleagues over the winter.\nEach year the Postgraduate Group gets a grant from IC Union.\nOver the last few years there has\nbeen difficulty in disposing of the\nmoney. If you have a trip organised,\nor need a new football etc for your\ndepartment team you may be\neligible for some money towards it.\nIf the money isn't used the grant\nwill be distributed elsewhere next\nsession.\nIf you've bothered to read this\narticle, thank you for your interest\nand I hope you will give your\nsupport during the coming year.\nRemember postgraduates represent 25% of all students at Imperial,\nlet's make an effort to present\nourselves as such.\nFrom September 19 I can be\ncontacted in the Neurobiology\nLab, Dept of Pure and Applied\nBiology or the Sub-Warden's flat\nFalmouth Hall( int 3352). I hope\nyou have a successful year and\nJook fo ward to meeting you.\nChris Hendy\nPaddy's Potato\nPatch\nDuring the summer term and the\nsummer vacation there has been a steep increase in the number of\nthefts that have taken place in the\nUnion Building. On at least five\noccasions either one or a group of\nstudents have forced entry into\ndifferent rooms and taken large\nobjects worth several hundred\npounds, and, in some cases have\neven taken personal possessions\nsuch as wallets, cheque books, credit cards, etc. So if you see\nanyone acting suspiciously would\nyou please inform security (under\nBeit Arch) immediately.\nSean Davis\n^ HM BBB HOH i Felix\n\n"

A torrid tale of terrible torment.\nAny resemblance to persons\nliving or dead is purely\ncoincidental Page 11\nARTHUR ANY ROOMS?\nMr Michael Arthur, Student\nServices Officer, ran into severe\nproblems with the management of\nthe Summer Lettings Scheme.\nExamples of overbooking, incorrect charging and mismanagement were rife in the first two\nweeks of the scheme's operation.\nThe extent of the overbooking\nonly became apparent when\npeople began arriving at Evelyn\nGardens where single rooms\nwere found to be substantially\noverbooked. When questioned\nabout this Mr Arthur declined to\ngive a figure but said that only a 'handful' of people were affected.\nTo accommodate these people\ndouble rooms were let as single\nrooms. When these rooms had\nbeen filled people had to be\nferried to other Head Tenancies\nand to the Halls of Residence.\nStudent Services had to resort to\nbooking rooms in Southside\nfrom the Summer Accommodation Centre at double the rate\npaid at Evelyn Gardens.\nThe Summer Letting Scheme is\nof crucial importance to student\nresidence. The income gained\noffsets the full cost of student\nresidences. This particular aspect\nof residence came under detailed\nexamination by John Lauwerys in\nhis recent report into student\nresidence. Mr Lauwerys drew\nattention to the small income\ngenerated by vacation letting\ncompared to that during term\ntime. To improve this for the\ncurrent vacation, a more realistic,\nallocation of rooms was given to\nthe conference office (Linstead\nand parts of Southside) leaving\nStudent Services to fill Evelyn\nGardens, Hamlet Gardens, the\nFremantle Hotel and the other\nHalls of Residence. Michael\nArthur, together with his student\nmanagers mounted a strong\nadvertising campaign to fill these\nrooms.\nHowever, when the bookings\nwere taken, they were not put on a chart or in a diary so Student\nServices were unaware that\noverbooking was taking place. It\nappeared that the percentage\noccupancy was high for the\nsummer, whereas there were\nperiods of heavy booking and\nperiods where a lull occurred. In\naccepting advanced deposits\nStudent Services committed itself\nto accommodating these people.\nThey are however attempting to\nsidestep their legal obligation by\nreturning these deposits. This\naction has caused a great deal of\ncomplaint from prospective\ncustomers.\nMr Arthur has encountered a further problem with the discount\nscheme that he had devised for\npeople who stay longer than four\nweeks. This discount was calculated by adjusting the VAT charged\non rent. However, it was\ndiscovered that the discounted\nrent fell below a previously agreed\nminimum. To remedy this Mr\nArthur did some 'creative account-ing' to raise the basic rent so that\nwhen the VAT component was charged the overall figure exceeded\nthe agreed minimum. This has\nbeen confirmed by a very authoritative source within Imperial\nCollege. Though Mr Arthur's action may not be illegal, its\ndisclosure will be acutely embarrassing to him.\nThe Summer Lettings Scheme\nis set to achieve a surplus\nsignificantly higher than in\nprevious years. Much of this\nsuccess is as a result of the hard\nwork of Jim Donaldson and his\nteam of Summer Lettings Managers. Mr Donaldson was instrumental in holding the Summer\nLettings Scheme together during\nMichael Arthur's absence.\nGuilds Romp Home!\nM0.&50I\\ Friday, August 5.19B3 Pictured here Mike Stuart, Tim Bell and the Guilds Pedal Ca rGB team after their marathon ride around Britain\u2014see page 3.\nm kW kW kW kW kw mm km km kW km kW km m Free!\n\n"

    "content": "Guilds\nRomp\nHome\nCity and Guilds Union completed a marathon pedal round\nBritain on Thursday 21 July to\nraise \u00a310,000 for a lifeboat\nengine for the RNLI. The nonstop pedal around the coast of\nthe British Isles took a record\n252 hours.\nThe Guilds Pedal Car was due\nto arrive at Charing Cross at\n7:00am to a media reception. In\nan effort to break the record for\nman powered circumnavigation\nof Britain, enthusiastic Guildsmen pedaled furiously overnight\nand arrived at the deserted\nstation at 2:30 in the morning.\nRather than wait five hours in\nthe cold for the press to arrive\nthe exhausted pedal car team\nwent to Imperial College to\nsnatch a few hours of much\nneeded sleep. They later returned to Charing Cross to the\nawaiting newsmen and photo-graph ers. Tim Bell holding up traffic\nTim Bell, of Chem Eng 3, last\nyear's Chairman of the Guilds\nPedal Car Club organised the\nevent. The club were unable to\ndesign a pedal car sturdy enough\nto make the whole trip so a car\nwas obtained externally. The\nbody of the car was made from a special high technology aircraft\ncomplex, chosen for its remarkably high strength to weight\nratio. The car often reached\nspeeds of up to 60mph and was\nfrequently stopped by police\nofficers who mistook it for an\nelectrically powered vehicle.\nThe event was enormously\nsuccessful receiving nationwide\nmedia coverage. Guilds are now\nwell on their way to raising the\n\u00a310,000 required for a lifeboat\nengine.\nBackslapping\nand\nBackstabbing\nThe final meeting of ICU Council this year proved to be both an\noccasion for self-congratulation and petty backbiting. Engraved pots\nand Honorary Life Membership were awarded for exceptional service\nto the Union to Mike Prosser, Publications Board Chairman; Nick\nPyne, U GM Chairman and former Welfare Officer; John McCallion,\nnon-sabbatical Deputy President, and this year's President Stephen\nGoulder. Other officers to receive Honorary Life Membership were\nAndy Grimshaw, Jonathan Miller, Ian Bull, Simon Rodan, Colin\nButter and Matthew Tonks. All were nominated by Stephen Goulder.\nMartin Taylor, this year's FELIX Editor and last year's Captain of\nthe University Challenge team received no appreciation for his work\nin the Union.\nEt tu Et tu Et tu\nCharles Fuller, acting President of RCSU, received the Dave\nChance Memorial Award, on behalf of RCSU. The award is a baby's dummy presented annually to the individual causing the most trouble\nfor Council over the year. This year the whole of RCSU was awarded\nthe D CMA by an over w nel ming majority in recognition of its many\ncock-ups and mis demean ours. Charles Fuller accepted the dummy\nfor RCSIT\nin characteristic bad grace, refusing to suck it.\nElections to College committees then ensued. The usual difficulty\nencountered in persuading people to stand for College committees of\nlittle or no importance such as the Refectory, Residence, Admissions\nPolicy and Safety Committees were overcome only after much verbal\narm twisting. However when there were freebies and decent parties in\nprospect, there was no shortage of candidates. Bar Committee and\nWine Committee were hotly contested. John Passmore and Dave\nParry were selected from a strong field for Bar Committee after a show of single transferable hands, all candidates professing a great\ninterest in and knowledge of beer. Wine Committee saw a contest\nbetween Hugh (T know nothing about wine') Stiles, Chris (T know all\nabout wine from being in the Officers' Mess') Cranshaw and Pallab\n(T'm an expert after visiting Stephen Goulder's office regularly)\nGhosh. Expert questions on vintages were provided by Stephen\nGoulder, and Chris Cranshaw was elected after getting most of the\nanswers right.\nNick Pyne proposed that the Union should continue to provide\ncompressed air powered whistles to all comers (provided they are\nfemale). Mines President Chris Cranshaw said that he too wanted a rape alarm on the grounds of sex equality (wishful thinking?-Ed). The\nmeeting voted in favour of Nick Pyne's proposal, with President-elect\nGaynor Lewis making a tactful abstention.\nMem\nAndy's Cock-up\nAndy Grimshaw, ex ICU Hon.\nSec. failed to keep the ICU vans\ninsured during the final four\nmonths of his sabbatical year.\nThis error was discovered by\nSean Davis, ICU Hon Sec, a week after he had taken over\noffice. By this time all of the ICU\nvans were out on tour with\nvarious clubs and societies.\nSean said that it was very\nfortunate that no van had been\ninvolved in an accident since\nFebruary. Had there been any\naccidents, the Union could well\nhave been faced with en or mo repair bills which would have\nseverely affected the transport\nbudget.\nThe reason for the lack of\ncover seams to be that Andy was\nattempting to negotiate a better\ndeal with Endsleigh Insurance to\ninsure the Transit vans. However, the discussions became\nrather prolonged and Andy\nmade no attempt to get cover in\nthe interim, leaving the vans\nuninsured.\nMore\nVicious\nTory\nCuts\nThe governing council of Queen\nElizabeth College, Chelsea\nCollege and Kings College have\napproved documents stating an\nintention to merge the three\ncolleges into one institution\nbased at the Kings College site\non the Strand.\nULU President Chris Sale said\nthat full integration will take five\nto ten years. The acquisition of\nproperties neighbouring Kings\nCollege still remains as a stumbling block to the merger.\nThe long term aim is to sell\noff the QEC and Chelsea sites\nand obtain a substantial reduction in student numbers. Steps\nhave already been taken to bring\ntogether teaching at QE C and\nKings. Physics is taught to\nundergraduates at both sites.\nHowever the bussing involved\nhas caused anger amongst the\nstudents and is bitterly oppose u by ULU.\nFelix Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Postgraduates\u2014Time for a Reaction\nUp to this point, his logic is impeccable\nAll the undergraduates having left college for\nthe summer vacation, the casual observer\nmay come to the conclusion that the\nacademic world winds down for the duration\nof the holidays with even the most dedicated\nmembers of staff taking a least a fortnight's holiday or pottering off to a 'conference' in a suitably hot location. However, upon closer\ninspection that stranger would notice huddles\nof strange-looking people cloistered near\ncoffee machines and refectories enjoying a drink without having to put up with those\nawful undergraduates forming long queues\nand blocking the corridors. A close inspection\nis indeed necessary since postgraduates are an\nanonymous breed involving themselves in the\nCollege, as a whole, as little as possible and\nalways looking suitably preoccupied. Yet it is\nthat very anonymity that has led people in\ngeneral, and College in particular, to assume\nthat supervisors are always interested, theses\nare all being written and that demonstrators\nare always present. As any postgraduate will\ntell you this is not the case.\nINCOMPLETE\nImperial College is a major centre for\nresearch in the fields of science and\nengineering and as such attracts a higher\nproportion of postgraduates than other\nLondon colleges and provincial universities; it\nis comparable, in this respect, with Oxford\nand Cambridge. At IC out of a total of 149\npostgraduates who commence PhDs 49 fail to\ncomplete them within the three years\nspecified. This, which can effectively be\nconsidered a failure rate, compares with ten\nto fifteen incomplete theses for Oxbridgefora\nsimilar intake. Thus IC has nearly three\ntimes the rate of incomplete work than\nOxbridge colleges with whom we are\ncompeting for those wealthy foreign students.\nIndeed Collegefindsthe idea of postgraduates\nfrom abroad paying fees so attractive that it\nwants to turn Weeks Hall into a postgraduate\nonly hall thus guaranteeing them accommodation for their first year something they are\nstill unable to do with undergraduates.\nCONCERN\nPerhaps these students would care to note\nthat London University, concerned about the\nsituation, suggested that PhDs should be\nawarded just for three yeas of advanced\nresearch whereas at present that research\nmust be original. IC rightly rejected this idea;\nit is simply attempting to paper over the ever\nwidening cracks without getting to grips with\nthe real problems. It is quite surprising that\nLondon University would consider such a proposition and it would hardly enhance IC's reputation as a 'centre of excellence'. It is the\nreal problems that must be identified\npage a mmm umm mmm mmm am In the postgraduate issue of FELIX of two\nyears ago the Postgraduate Affairs Officer of\nthe time (Doug Armstrong) and Nick Morton\n(then ICU President) wrote an article\nsuggesting possible problems that might\narise.\nThey asked postgraduates to respond to\n/. Overrunning the three years.\n2. Incomplete experimental work at the writing up\nstage.\n3. Is selection a problem?\n4. Failure of supervisors to examine the progress of\nprojects frequently enough.\n5. Supervision and the problems with supervisors.\nThey asked postgraduates to respond to\nthe article and using the results of their\nresponse they intended to precipitate some\naction on the matter from College. They got\nno response whatsoever. It was quite clear\nthat, at the time, postgraduates were simply\nnot interested in attempting to solve their\nproblems. They were prepared just to keep\nplodding on in their now traditional,\nanonymous fashion.\nSince postgraduates fail to respond to such\ninitiatives it is necessary for anyone\nconcerning themselves with the subject to\nseek out information from individuals\u2014\nnotably past postgraduate affairs officers\u2014to\nhear what conclusions their own experience\nhas led them to. A major problem is poor\nsupervision. The difficulties related to\nsupervision are the lack of a person to whom\none can complain, lack of someone with\nauthority to take action, and the pos sib lit y of\nirreparably damaging the relationship\nbetween student and supervisor which is\nnecessary for a successful completion. One\npossible course of action, although it is by no\nmeans a solution to all the aspects of this\nproblem, is to have two supervisors. This\nshould lead to a greater degree of supervision, and certainly reduces the threat of having a particularly bad supervisor for the whole\nthree years. Royal Holloway College use this\nsystem for their postgraduates and although\ncomparison is difficult it seems to be an\neffective one.\nSUPERVISION\nSupervision is not the only problem which\narose in discussion. Often, the research itself\nis poorly defined\u2014students can spend time\nworking on topics that are irrelevant to the\nsubject because they are unsure of what the\nactual research subject is; the project should\nbe defined specifically from the start. This\nwould also help the student ensure that the\nresearch will be original and that the topic\nhas not, nor is being, researched, elsewhere.\nIt will also help to decide whether three years\nis too long or not long enough for the volume\nof work specified and appropriate action can\nbe taken at a much earlier stage.\nIt is however necessary for postgraduates in\ngeneral to respond, to act and to intervene.\nAny academic affairs officer,for both undergraduates and postgraduates needs feedback\nto enable him to go to a meeting with\nfacts\u2014not just personal opinions that can be\ndismissed as such. When this happens\nchanges\u2014however slowly\u2014can be made.\nCollege an 1\nUniversity of London are clearly\nworried about the situation; it is therefore a prime time to act and seek suitable change.\nAny change will come from the postgraduates themselves since it is they who\nknow the problems and experienced the\ndifficulties. If no feedback is forthcoming\nthen problems will remain and the blame will\nrest quite clearly\u2014with postgraduates.\nN Shackley, Chem Eng 2\n\u2022 HH HH HM H Hi Felix\n\n"

As if this\nweren't enough he writes most of their\nsongs and plays guitar.\nIn April 1981 he placed the obligatory\nadvert in the music press and via a band\ncalled Purple Forest teamed up with Fred\nDurell, a female singer and keyboard\nplayer.\nThe band then changed their name to\nTwelve Cubic Feet and recorded an EP in\nOctober 1981. Unfortunately this wasn't released until August 1982 (on Paul's Namedrop label).\nAs a profit-making venture the EP failed\nbut around 500 copies were sold, and\naccording to the band, is still available\nthrough Rough Trade.\nSince then the band has undergone\nI several personnel changes and gigged very\nlittle recently due to the introduction of\nnew members. In addition to Paul and\nFred the band includes Arnold Flagstaff\n(lead guitarist) and drummer Dave Morgan,\na 'veteran' of the London music scene who\nhas played with bands supporting acts as\nvaried as JoBoxers and Funkapclitan and\nrates 12CF as the best band he's played\nwith to date.\nThe IC influence comes from the two\nmost newest members: Eric Jarvis, onetime physicist and stalwart of the IC rock\nscene (guitarist for the legendary Futile\nHurling and bassist for 12CF) and the\npetite Franky Williams, microbiology\ngraduate, clarinet player and singer.\nAs mentioned above personnel hassles\nhave curtailed the bands recent live\nperformances so this preview is based on\nwatching the band rehearse and on the\n(L to Ft): Arnold, Paul, Fred, Franky, (top) and Eric\nPractise Makes Perfect\nI remember once sitting in the FELIX\nOffice with a group of Dramsoc the spi?ns as Eric Jarvis held forth on the sub jsc t of\nrehearsals\u2014'People have survived a weekend on just one sandwich to attend\nrehearsals', he opined as the company\nprepared to go to the Edinburgh Fringe\nFestival. Now a year later a new band of\nhopefuls are rehearsing for the fringe and\nEric is over an hour late.\nTwelve Cubic Feet begin without him,\nArnold play ng bass. The result is\nfrequently chaotic, their cheeky post-punk\npop suffering as the vocals and clarinet\nare lost in the mix whilst the lead guitar is\nmissing and the keyboard fights a losing\nbattle with the rampant rhythm section.\nIn time-honoured music journalist\ntradition I retire to the bar and return\nforty-five minutes later to find the band at\nfull strength.\nThis time round 12CF really do cook-rhythm guitar, bass and drums meshing to\nform a foil for some 'catchy' guitar and\nkeyboards. Again the vocals are lost but\nthe same had happened to Echo and the\nBunnymen less than 100 yards away the\nweek before and they nearly lifted the roof\noff the Albert Hall. 12CF lack the intensity\nand searing power of Echo (and I'm sure\nit doesn't unduly worry them) but they've\ngot a beat you can dance to, melodies\nyou can hum and two pretty girl singers\u2014\nwhat more do they need and what more\ndo you want?\nLooking Forward\nIn line with their ambitious debut EP\n(review alongside) 12CF are now breaking\nout of the routine live rock format to play\nin Dramsoc's two hour presentation at the\nEdinburgh Fringe Festival. There, people\nmiming to their songs will only be one of\nthe many s prog s on this marriage of\nmusic and theatre. In the meantime they\nare one of a package of three bands and\na poet playing Adam's Arms in Conway\nStreet, W1, tomorrow night (Saturday).\nFelix I A Pretty Thing\nTwelve Cubic Feet's Straight\nOut The Fridge is a pretty\nimpressive and unus uei product even before\nplay it (barring some of the\ndod gy artwork in the pack-age).\nIt's a seven track 10\" EP\nwith a high quality glossy\nsleeve (a pretty blue and\npink illustration) and an\neighteen page booklet with\nlyrics and info. It's even\npressed on heavy vinyl and\nhas an inner sleeve!\nOf the seven tracks only\ntwo are definitely in the\nband's current live show:\none is Hello Howard, easily\ntheir best with a memorable\nchorus and some of the\n'best' lyrics I 've heard in a long time.\nDeisel engines fill my head\nThey run on my one track\nmind\nThey're the only form of\ntransport I can find\nThe Undertones immediately come to mind (is\nthere any higher praise?)\n(Biased-Ed).\nMary's got the bug is also\nplayed in the current set but\nthankfully Fred isn't as\nspike y voiced as she was in\n1981. The 'spi keynes s' works\nmuch better on Blob, a song\nabout masturbation which\ndeserves to make it into the\nlive set.\nThe other major song on\nthe EP is The Almshouse,\n12CF's shot at a long serious number in which only\nthe pretentious lyrics detract from the atmosphere of\nthe number.\nPeter Rodgers\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HH Page 1\n\n"
