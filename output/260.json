After Geoff Martin had warned of \"mob rule\" by a minority, in his presidential address on the opening day, the conference rejected both a motion of no confidence and a weaker one of censure in the NUS executive over their handling of the grants campaign. It had previously been thought that the second motion stood a good chance of sr ces s, being tabled by23 colleges and universities, but it was defeated by251 votes to1 U7. A moderate, Trevor F& sK, was elected as President to succeed Geoff Martin, another Moderate.5 'isle was\nelected in preference to Jack Straw, a Radical Student Alliance sym pathi seer, by a two to one majority after a night of discussion on whether he\nwas qualified to stand. According to the NUS constitution the candidates must be full tine students. For the past two years Fisk has been full time secretary of the Union although he recently signed on as a student at the Middle Temple* There is still the possibility of legal proceedings being taken to disqualify him. All the major posts went to present members of the executive. Jack Straw was elected deputy present, Ian Cunningham, at present treasurer, was\nelected secretary and Albert Preston treasurer* On the Monday the conference was add roo sed by Mr. Edward Heath, Leader of the Opposition, who, in answer to questions said that the Conservatives, when returned to power, would not subs t it ute loans for grants to undergraduates but would \"keep an open mind\" about loans to graduate students, Mr. Heath was given a warm reception. On the final day of the conference Geoff Martin warned of outside interference in student affairs and revealed that he had received letters sent to students at Liverpool University by a Conservative ex MP asking for details about student leaders and the RSA. ED: This report is disturbingly reminiscent of the situation in the USA where a file on student leaders and activities is kept by the FB I.(.n policy matters the conference threw cut the idea of book voucher store pla. ee the present allocation of \u00a330 per year in the grant and expr e \u00bb ~\nsed dissatisfaction with the present system of eliminations.,(\" You might as well give k first to everyone over six feat tall\"* \u00b0 s one sentiment expressed) and wit k the B.Ed degree.

Howe ver, the change is atleast in the right direction.'4 TECHNICIANS\nSTRIKE THREAT\nTechnicians a tIC are threaten!1 to strike if the University of London refuses to increase their special London cost of living allowance. The\ndispute has been dragging on for five months now and involves technical staff at college r: all over London* It is believed that if the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs( recently formed a merger between A.S.S.E.T. and the A.S c.W) sanctions strike action, a work stoppage could be financed to the tune of \u00a3 1 0 , 0 0 0 a week, enabling the500 Union members to star out fo a considerable time. Union Branch Secretary, Mr. Rar Fair brother, said that the Universit, Grants Committee have agreed to pay the increase if the University wish, but the University decided to refer the matter to the Prices and In comes board, although they think the claim is reasonable. The University is als i insisting on a corresponding increase for academic staff, although the Association of University Teachers \"hi .\nnot asked for one. The Ministry of Labour has said that the reference of the claim to the PIB by the Universi! is an outrageous procedure. Mr, Fair brother called the University action\" illogical and unjust\", especially~ art he cost of the increase can be clair.e d from UGC. The technicians are als<\nannoyed because the London allowance for workers in similar categories in the Civil Service, has recently been increased. Miss Anne Nolan, College Press Officer, said this was primarily a dispute between the Unions and Lond or University but that the college au thi.r i ti.es were aware of the pos siM ll tie of a strike.

    "content": "CENSORSHIP\nAT IC?\nSir, The article in the last issue of FELIX Late News'was incorrect. There w.s censorship imposed onI.C. Peace Action Group. The two most likely culprits are Mrs. Robinson, the Union factotum, and Lord Penney, the Rect on Neither had any business interfering with the interception and diversion of Press telephone calls from an official Union SCC club, IC Peace Action Group, without, atleast( although this is questionable) telling an off\"icial of the club. The argument that Miss Anne Nolan, the College Press Officer, to whom the calls were diverted, knew\nbetter how to handle the wily press men does not stand up to inspection. It was IC Peace Action Group representatives who got the two articles in the Guardian, about the incident, both factually correct. Miss Nolan could have only given the official College views since she had not found out from anyone in ICPAG their views. This is an example of the worst sort of blanket censorship typical of nefarious government es tabl.1 s hm& Tvts \u2022\nPhilip Painter. ED: When seen by FELIX Mr M.J.

The publications at IS\"\nshow that the college's only inventive trait is in a strictly scientific field. PHOENIX, which sets out to be a literary magazine, appears at the beginning of this term and while it is an improvement on previous years' efforts it seems to contain articles rejected by a paper like the New\nStatesman. It is painfully un freaky. Articles on' Suicide' and' Television and the News' are quite interesting but are best left to the Sunday news-papers. Where PHOENIX can score is by printing short stories and poetry. In the present issue there area few poems and only one short story. The latter is quite pretty, but little more. Possibly the most interesting article is one by Andy Jordan, which verges on a self analysis and a how s that however much we may fancy otherwise we are all cast in a similar mould.

    "content": "PAGE kommen t There has recently been a great deal of speculation and suggestions on how to improve the Union constitution. A number of motions are down\nfor Tuesday's Union Meeting to change the constitution, some of which! comt radi ct others. Several people have' written to FELIX expressing their views on a revised Union structure and! the Socialist Society( why this one of the80 societies in ICI have n't discovered) went so far as to produce its report. We a rct cbe treated to the marathon Booth man Duck ett multi clause motion at the third attempt on Tuesday which, if passed, into to will be a drastic alteration of the byelaws, and indeed their whole complexion. Without wishing to com ment on the merits or demerits of this motion or parts of it, it seems\nto me that to attempt such a fundamental change in this way is most\ninadvisable. It is. impossible to have detailed and well informed discussion of such a large motion at a Union Meeting. The inevitable effect is that the various portions Will be put to the vote without anything like proper discussion. It will also not be possible to discuss genuine alter at ives( rather than am mend ment s) both to the motion and to the present arrangements. v Vh at is needed, if a comprehensive motion to change the byelaws is to be introduced, is a motion which has been thrashed oat between a committee about the size of Council representing all shades of opinion. This could then be easily endorsed by a Union Meeting and much less time would be wasted by all* Imperial College, LONDON S.W.7. Internal2831 Tel. KEN 2963\nEditor: DAVID COOPER\nWith: John Mull aly, Paul Heath, Rory Red may ne, Dave Potter, John Probst, John Sommer, Chris SleeK en Simpson and Caroline, VIETNAM TEACH IN\nDear Sir, We feel it was rather a poor piece of sophistry on the part of your report ex? covering the VietNam teach into equate antiwar protests with anti Americanism. In dismissing Sir William Zak' s speech as a\" tub thumping\" exhibition of\" scorn and pre dj jud ice V he allowed his gw n prejudice of trade unions to blind him to one important fact: William Zak' s\" juggling of figures\" demonstrated V effectively that the regime the American Government is defending at such appalling cost is corrupt and unpopular to the extent that it must throw even non Communist opposition into jail. Senators Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy also maintain this. Are they anti American too? Your reporter is wrong in thinking we do not hear the views of the Saigon Government very often. These are the official views of the American State Department that we hear reiterated parrot fashion in almost every daily newspaper. These are the views that condemned the execution of police officials as an atrocity but dismissed the maiming and slaughter often s of thousands of Vietnamese civilians by indiscriminate shelling, by napalm and antipersonnel bombs, as an unfortunate incident of war. We\nfeel that sympathy for Mr. Nguyen Van An is misplaced. When we object to double standards such as these, the cause is not anti Americanism. Our protest is against the minority clique of military commanders and politicians who\nare prepared to see an entire nation annihilated to serve their own self \u00ab*\ninterests. If your reporter feels a certain intellectual weariness with the \"by -now predictable\" antiwar arguments, we would beg him not to come to teach in son VietNam. But if he does choose to come, we would ask him to atleast treat them with the seriousness they deserve. Francis Okoh ( Min2) A.N a gui( M.L.. PQ) "

Report of Royal Commission\nA medical faculty for IC is re commended in the Report of the Royal Commission on Medical Education published this month. The Report recommends that the number of London Medical Schools should be halved by merging St, Bartholomew fe with London, University College with the Royal Free, Middlesex with St, Mary's, Guy's with King's College, Westminster with Charing Cross and St. George's with St, Thomas' s. Each of these should have an in take of about200 students per year and around1000 total, and each should become the medical faculty of a London college. If these recommendations are carried out the Westminster Charing Cross combination would become the medical faculty of I.C. The Charing Cross Hospital at present has plans to rebuild in Jul ham and has recommendation for an in take of7080 students per year. The report re commends that if, as seems likely, no room is available on the I.G. site, that the pre clinical department!* able to take around200 students a year should be built in Chelsea by the Royal Marsden and Bros ip ton Hospital on Pul ham Road, The proposed I.C. Westminster Charing Cross Hospital teaching group would also take in the Royal Marsden Hospital, the Institute of Cancer Research, the Brompton Hospital, the Institute for Diseases of the Chest, the National Heart Hospital and the Institute of Cardiology. The Institute of Denial Surgery and the Eastern Dental Hospital would be associated with the group. Even if the recommendations of the Report are acted upon it is likely to be many years before they mate rial ize. Donovan makes \u00a3 1 4 5 0\nDonovan' s concert at the end of last term was a huge success by any standards, A profit of511+59 was made\nall of it from ticket sales, program mes and a collection, John Peel introduced the first guests, The? lame, to a capacity audience. This couple turned out to be disappointing. Possibly because of nerves, they didn't seem at their best and they also performed beyond their time. They were followed by Tyrannosaurus Rex. This is a group I would go far out of ray way to see again, although no doubt their style doesn't appeal to everyone. Marc uses his voice as an instrument as well as a singer of words. Their current single,\" Deborah\", is an example. The one unmitigated flop was John Peel's poetry recital in one song, There followed a brief pause for recovery of the senses, during which I spoke briefly with Donovan.
