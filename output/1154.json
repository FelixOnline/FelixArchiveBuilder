The fantastic music\nthat accompanies Driver may be somewhat funkier\nthan that in the film, but the\nimage of a line of police\ncars on your tail bears incredible resemblance to the film.\nWorking on both sides of the\nlaw, the player will be immersed in the faithfully\nreproduced streets of several\nAmerican cities. Whether you are running from the police or working for them you'll need to thrash your car around in aggressive style\nbut without running it into\nthe ground. Hand brake turns, high speeds and skid\nmarks embrace the game play in large quantities, but\nto fulfil the tasks set before\nyou, you will need to learn\nhow to handle these skills\nwith finesse and fine jud g ment. It is these qualities\nthat ensure this is one remarkable gaming experience. Sublime graphic s,immer sive sound, realistic car handling as well as originality and on the-edge tension all make this game shine. Brilliant.\nViv\nI really love flying. In my time in the RAF cadets, I took to the air in\neverything from single prop Chipmunks to four engined Hercules transports and I loved every minute of it. Because of this, I also love flight\nsims - all the experience of flying without the expense and the smell of aviation fuel.\nFly! is a serious flight sim, designed with real propellerheads in mind. Supplied on three CD's, it is certainly detailed. Maps of the entire\nworld are included, although only five major US airports are mapped out in much detail. With five planes to choose from, on the surface\nthis looks like a good game. However, Fly! doesn't have much else going for it. The problem with\nreleasing a serious flight sim like this is that there already is one/ Microsoft Flight Sim - that's been around for ever, does everything you could want it to and has great graphics. In order for there to be any point at all releasing your simon the market, you have to offer either\na better product, or one that does something entirely new and differ-ent. Otherwise you might as well not bother.\nThe most obvious problem is the graphics. Compared to other games such as Falcon 4.0 or Flight Simulator, the scenery is sparsely detailed, the textures are blurry and the clouds are just plain bizarre. It's a bit like\nflying a plane with a thin layer of margarine smeared on the cockpit\nwindow. The whole point of a flight sim is to make the player feel like\nthey are actually flying a real plane. If the graphics are so bad that\nyou sometimes can't even tell whether the plane is moving or not, it's not really simulating much at all. The game also has more than its fair share of bugs and glitches. After\ninstalling the game it took mean hour to get my network connection working properly again. Because I'm using a Voodoo based graphics card, I have to start flying, quit the mission and then restart in order to\nmake it work. Minor things, maybe, but irritating all the same. I have to admit that, despite my complaints, I did enjoy a few of the\nscenarios included in the game trying to land at San Francisco airport in a thunderstorm for example but there are far better flight sims\non the market.\nBasically, don't buy this unless one of the game's developers forces you to at gun point. And even then, hang on to the receipt.\nJust like Michael J. Fox traded his skate-board for ah overboard, you can chuck\nyour gamepad and get yourself an Airp ad. What is an Air pad? A revolutionary controller that uses the natural movement of\nthe player'shand to direct the pad and game in the direction you want to go. As you move, the tilt-sensitive pad will\ntransfer your movements into the game you're playing. Remember those rally\ngames when you willed the car round hairpin bends at incredible speeds by\naggressively flinging yourself to one side? Well now instead of looking like a prat and crashing, you can look like a prat and actually make the turn.\nThe Air pad has its own microprocessor and works with optical technology. This\nlets it react instantaneously to your\nmovements. The Air pad will be compatible with any game but will come into its\nown in driving, simulation and action\ngames, although it will be just as effective with platform games. It also supports\nboth analogue and digital modes, which\nis good to hear. At the moment it will\nonly be available for the playstation\nwhere it will have the standard layout of\nthe playstation pad. The technical chaps at Air pad are working on aPC and Dreamcast design for the future (no N64 unfortunately). The air pad will retail at\n\u00a3 1 9 . 9 9 . I reckon it will be worth it\nbecause you will get so much more gameplay out of the games, especially\nafter forking out40 or so precious\npounds for them. Mark "

I guess\nthe best place is with something I learnt when I was very young - \"with\nevery right comes responsibility\"; this\nextends into everything we do. For example with the right to vote comes the responsibility to use that vote, or equally the right to free speech\nshould require the speaker to be\nresponsible for what they say.\nSo far this term Felix has allowed\nit's writers to enter into a series of anonymous personal vendettas\nwhich seem to simply aimed at stirring up emotion within the IC student\npopulation. Indeed the editor of this\nnewspaper openly admitted to me that he knew in advance of last\nweeks edition going to press that\n\" break point\" contained intentionally placed gross factual inaccuracies.\nWhilst the author (who's identity Ido know) should know better, it is the\neditor who is paid by you to keep you\ninformed about all matters related to\nIC, and when that author allows articles to be published containing incorrect information simply aimed at stirring up emotion, I( not as a sabbatical officer - but instead, as a student of this college) hold him to\naccount and ask him to explain his\nactions to you his readership.\nSince starting this job back in\nJuly I have worked hard and Iam still\ntrying hard to do well in a job, which\nby its very nature is extremely difficult,\nand when the standard of my work\nand my motives are called into question by an article filled with lies... I find that personally offensive and quite upsetting. Felix plays an imp or tant part in the democratic system\nhere at IC, and part of that role\ninvolves calling the sabbaticals to\ncheck when they start to stray, however if Felix continues with this course\nof allowing it's writers to condemn the sabbaticals without any cause\nthen when a sabbatical does actually require pulling back into line noone will be listening to you. The phrase \"cry wolf\" springs to mind.\nI'm sorry for those of you who have had to endure this rant but I Feedback\nneeded to do it. When someone intentionally attacks my work I get\nvery offended and upset... Iam here\nto represent you and if I should ever\nstop doing that Iam only too happy\nfor Felix to call me to account for my actions, but I must ask Dave Roberts\n(the editor) to take seriously his role\nas editor and remember the responsibilities that come with the right to\nprint a newspaper. I for one have\nbeen deeply personally offended by\nan article which he knew was factually incorrect and Iam disappointed\nwith him both as an editor, and as a friend for allowing last weeks \"break\npoint\" article to go to print unedited.\nTim Trailor\nDeputy President (Clubs & Socs)\nAN OPEN LETTER TO\nTHE RECTOR\nDear Sir Ronald\nWe are writing to you as a group of 4th year medical students from the\nSchool of Medicine. We have recently completed our Obstetrics and Gynaecology course at St Mary's and were shocked to read in IC\nReporter that you had given the new video link lecture system an award for\nexcellence.\nIt is now a year since we were\nexpecting our first interactive lecture\nover the new system. We were promised that we would be able to view\nlectures at the hospitals where we were based, but we could not. We were promised that these lectures\nwould be video ed for a sort of edu cation by correspondence course,\nbut this did not happen for the whole\nof our third year either. Time after\ntime we have been let down by false\npromises of a start date for the complete system. A small fortune was spent in the last year by all-too-poor\nmedical students commuting to a central location for each lecture.\nIt has been our experience that\nthis system has repeatedly been an unmitigated disappointment and an abject failure. How it can win an award for excellence is beyond us.\nin June, the Principle of the med ical school, Prof Edwards, said that\nthe project was \" something that noone is proud of\" and that it's failure\nhad been recognised and that con tractors had been brought in to remedy the situation. A time scale for these changes was put in place and widely publicised, but once again only failure has followed. Last week,\nonly days before our finals, one of\nour lecturers had to travel all the way\nto Chelsea and Westminster to give\na lecture to3 people there and26 people at St Mary's, just because her\nlecture could not be transmitted from\nSt Mary's. There are many more stories of similar fiascoes - it is still not\nunusual for a lecture to be transmitted without sound or picture or both.\nWe hope that you will not proceed with this award, and we look\nforward to reading your response.\nSigned by 13 fourth year students from ICS M( names available\non request).\nUNFAR ANONYMITY?\n[What follows was not sent to me for\npublication, but I would like your\nfeedback and have thus published it\nanyway. Sorry for any annoyance\ncaused to the writer. ]\nDear Dave, Iam writing to complain about\nrecent anonymous columns printed\nin Felix such as Breakpoint and MishM a sh.I feel that the anonymity of the\nwriters allows them to get away with\nwriting articles that can be more ven-dic ti ve and untrue than those writers\nwho reveal their names. It allows\nthem to cause more upset to the subjects of their articles without taking\nany responsibility by revealing their\nnames.\nI feel that if these writers are\ngiven the opportunity to influence the\nthinking of many students in the way that felix allows, then they should be\nforced to reveal their identity and take responsibility for the columns\nthat they write. If they still wish for their names not to be published,\nthen it should be possible for people\nThe deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk. Letters may be edited for length but not grammar or spelling.\n\n"

Apparently, no decision will\nbe taken until December, little time\nto inform those affected. Unsurprisingly, the University has found it difficult to find hall staff willing to work\nover the Millennium. There are also\nconcerns about possible effects of\nthe Millennium Bug, with particular\nworries expressed about the effect\nof power cuts on lifts and fire alarm systems, especially given that street\nparties may make it difficult for the\nemergency services to reach students in trouble.\nOver the Summer, it was prop o sed that all students wishing to\nremain in University ac com mod ation over the New Year period should be moved into a single hall\nof residence, in order to save on staffing and reduce the risk of problems associated with the Millennium Bug. According to the Residences\nManager, Sharin e Brown, those\nplans have now been scrapped. She admitted it would have proved\n\"a nightmare\" for students and parents alike, and agreed it would not\nhave been fair, since students have\npaid for accommodation over the\nNew Year period. But no alternative\nplan has been agreed. Mrs Brown\nconfessed \"it will be a mammoth task to sort something out\". She admitted the number of Warden and security staff that would be available had not yet been established, and did not rule out the possibility of asking post-graduate students to help out. Natasha New ton, Imperial Coi ie ge Union President, said the Union had every\nconfidence that the Residences office will be able to sort this out\".\nBut she expressed concern that halls\nmight not be sufficiently staffed with\nWardens, and said she hoped that if\nit came to it, the Wardens would agree to work over the New Year.\nThe Residences Office is now under pressure to inform students of\ntheir plans as quickly as possible.\nThe meeting of the Rector's commit tee on student residences on Oct ober 1 3th was the last opportunity for\nthe University to lias e directly with\nIhe ICU, but no decision was reached, and the next meeting is\nnot until February. The College's Millennium Issues group will be meeting in the next couple of weeks,\nbut according to Sharine Brown\nthey will be unable to come to any decision until they knowhow many\nstudents are planning to stay for the\nNew Year. That will not become clear until the results of a student\nquestionnaire are known a questionnaire that is not being issued\nuntil the end of November. In Brief\nGATECRASHER\nThe thrill of a night out in the\nUnion was too much for one student to resist on Friday 1 5 Octo ber. The reveller attempted to\ngain entry to the Union via the\nscaffolding surrounding Beit\nQuad's entrance. The breach led\nto security officers scanning the building with their canine compatriots.

Three years\ndown the line, I have managed the Science and Natural History\nMuseums once and the V&A not\nat all. For the first time I popped in, and inside I found the Canon photo gallery currently showing\nthe Triple Exposure exhibition.\nTriple Exposure showcases the\nwork of three photographers of\nthe 1 9 6 0 s Michael Cooper, John Cowan and Ronald Traeger.\nAll three enjoyed brief, intense\nprofessional lives, untimely death\nclaiming them just as their\ndecade faded to a close. These\nphotographers between them\nhave worked with the Stones, the\nBeetles, Kubrick, Twiggy and Mary Quant. In many ways they\nredefined fashion photography\nand yet there are also incredibly\nthoughtful pieces here. Cooper photographed the cover for the\nSergeant Pepper album but his\ngrainy shots of the Grovesnor\nSquare anti-Vietnam riots better\ncapture the period.\nLook at the world through these\npictures and you look with the\neyes of someone who was there\nand who was a part of the revolution. Remember This\nNational Theatre\n\u00a3 7 . 5 0 for students throughout October7:30 pm The new Stephen Poliakoff play at the National Theatre\nsees him reunited with director Ron Daniels. The pair\nworked together previously on, amongst other things, the\naward-winning ' Blinded by the Sun', and Poliakoff himself\nhas won numerous accolades for his plays and films.\nDealing with issues similar to those in his superb trilogy of\nfilms ' Shooting the Past', he tells the story of failed entrepreneur Rick (Stanley Townsend) who discovers that the collection of wedding videos made during one of his\n'enterprises' in the late 7 0 ' s are deteriorating into a series\nof blotched images. He finds, via two Swiss archivists, that\nthe events of recent history are also being erased from videos worldwide. Realising the possible implications of\nthis discovery he sees his last chance to make his fortune.\nBut the resulting events are unpredictable and not everything goes quite to plan. Despite impeccable staging and the very innovative use of\nvideo and music, the play somehow just doesn't work and leaves a strange feeling of listlessness. The characters are, in the most part, true to life, almost to the point of being\nmundane and it is their familiarity that exposes the implausibility of the tale. The. story doesn't quite ring true, nor arouse much interest in spite of the actors often ex ag ge rated attempts to convince us otherwise. Our emotions are not stirred by the idea of losing a few videos, and this is the\nplay's downfall. With amaze of storylines, and an often jumpy format (the\ncharacters alternately relive the events and present their\nown retrospective monologues), the message is unclear.\nNonetheless, the play is at times very funny, with most of\nthe humour coming from the two Swiss, who are mercilessly parodied, and are in fact the only characters with any\nreal panache. A bit of a let-down really, as it could have\nworked very well - a more gripping 'discovery' would have\nmade all the difference.\nCandide\nNational Theatre\nIn rep, final performance: Tue 2 5 th January 2 0 0 0\nStudent Standby \u00a3 1 0\nMusicals: most people think of soaring, romantic\npop tunes, stunning dance routines and huge sets.\nIndeed, one starts to think whether these shows\nwould still be brilliant if the helicopters and barricades that we are all used to were taken away. The\nNational's latest musical offering for its current rep\nseason suggests that they most definitely would. Candid e is based on the book by Voltaire, and promotes unfailing optimism no matter how awful a situation appears at the time, resulting in the notion\nthat \"Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\". John C aird' s new version uses a basic\nbut ingenious set, designed by the master of musical\nset design John Napier, letting his cast give the tale\napace and life that never waives, even throwing in\nthe odd Python-esque moment along the way.\nAlthough more famous for musicals such as West\nSide Story and On the Town, Bernstein's Operetta Candid e is probably the composer's most accomplished theatrical score. He chose Voltaire's book as\nit gave him the chance to attack the optimism that\nprevailed in 1 9 5 0 ' s America under Dwight D Eisenhower's presidency, and his collaboration with a number of lyricists, including the legendary Stephen\nSondheim, results in some of the wittiest lyrics I have\never heard on the stage.\nThe real genius in Candid e, however, is that it man ages to be satirical and hilarious, but at the same\ntime asks those worldly questions that we all would like an answer to. You will roll in the aisles, question\nyour own existence and feel the hairs rise on your\nneck. If you don't like \" Musicals\", go and see this, it\nmight just change your mind. If you love musicals,\ngo and see this, but for once you won't have to look\nthrough the set to see the real show.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 an Tom Judy and Gillian Ben Pickersgill\n\n"

It\nwas submitted by email on Sunday\n10th, which ought to give you enough time. Twice last year I submitted articles which didn't get into\nFelix - overlooked, I suppose. If you\nwant clubs to write more for Felix,\nplease make sure you print what they\nsend!\nIam not a great fan of Felix and find little of interest in it these days.\nAlthough it is \"The Student New spa per of Imperial College\" I see it as\nmostly a condensed version of \"Time\nOut\". If I want to know what is happening around college I have to\nconsult \"IC Reporter\". Whenever Felix comments on College policy or decisions, it is often badly researched and one-sided - and followed up next issue with an apology.\nI would like to see Felix devoted\nexclusively to Imperial College. Don't duplicate what is already done elsewhere. If I want national/international news I read a newspaper; if I want to know what's on in London or\non TV I look up \"Time Out\" or \" TV Times\". Let us know what is going on around college - not only clubs/socs\nevents but also special guest lec-ture s, lunch time concerts (also\nevening concerts in Royal School of\nMusic, which are also free), careers\ntalks, departmental open days, etc.\nGive us informed, balanced, well-researched comment on Coi ie ge issues - don't just jump on the bandwagon. Get rid of the pages and pages of reviews of music, games,\nvideos, nightclubs, etc. Focus on the\ncollege and the students, make Felix\ndistinctive and worthwhile.\nRegards\nBarry Gale Physics UG4 INTEGRATION:\nTHE QUEST CONTINUES\nDear Sir,\nIs it me or has everyone missed\nthe point of integration? It is not\nabout Medics or non-Medics liking\nor disliking each other more or less.\nIt is not about retaining or discarding\ntradition. Nor is it it about some evil\ninsurgent movement of medics into\nICU, or ICS M being swallowed whole by a load of apathetic IC stu-dents. It is about eco nom ising. Why else would Sherfield\napprove and adopt such a scheme?\nICU and ICS M should be more concerned with improving the standard\nof student life at Imperial and the\nservices provided. Not blaming each\nother for their lack of co-operation.\nIf they continue to fight amongst\nthemselves there will be nothing left\nto call \"Student Sen/ices\", with no\nsocial activities outside of your own\ndiscipline, and I for one do not relish\nthe idea of a9o 'clock lecture being\nthe social event of the year!\nPlease, give up on the petty\nsquabbles and make college a place\npeople want to be.\nYours sincerely\nA student\nAND FINALLY...\nDear Sir,\nIf indeed the A& E Group Chair( how appropriate) runs for a sabbatical position this year, we can expect\nhis tenure to be as good as his trumpet playing; i.e. poor quality, with\nsplits all over the place.\nWith kind regards (and no, I'm not Breakpoint)\nAndy Heeps\nICS M3 THANKS FOR THE LETTERS.\nAll complaints should be addressed to the Editor. If no satisfactory\nreply is received, contact ICU Exec via the Union President\ntion ot balance between ne\nreviews, in the form of Bart\nter (left). Aside from a pol< for forgetting to print you entry (sorry - ninety hour tend to take it out of you Firstly, sorry to Tim Traiior for\nany offence caused I certainly\nto slag him off or to suggest that\nhe isn't doing his job properly.\nThe point of printing *he piece( which I must admit I disagreed important issue that needs to be\nImperial's sportsmen and women the future. And to be honest, I 'll\nquite happily print any reasonable columns represent people' so pin ions not facts) in the aim of op e ning up the discussion. So, I chose to print last week's BreakPoint\nand,y' know what, this week along queue of people went to ask\nTim about the issue and he's consequently written a full ex plan ation of the status quo, which you'll\nfind on page4. But, of course, I'm sure the two aren't related...\nNext, you'll see that the abi li ty of anonymous writers to remain anonymous has been called into\nquestion by one of the Union Officers (note lh at the letter printed on the opposite page was not\ndeliberately written for pu D lica-tion). The simple answer to this\npoint is that there is no way that\npublication would deliberately reveal the identity of an anonymous source. I know for a fact\nthat it would irrevocably damage the ability of the writers to collect\ninformation if their identity was\nknown, and so it would seem decidedly unfair( as well as\nimmoral) to reveal their identities.\nOf course, the issue of responsibility still remains, but on that\nscore the answer is simple - I take\nfull responsibility for every word printed in *his year's Felix. That,\namongst a few other -h: ngs, is\nwhat I'm getting paid for...\n\u2022 diary\nweeks there is a higher ratio or reviews\nto news and features than I would ideally like. However, alongside it's role as a source of IC news\npus events, Felix is also a club for\npeople who wan t'o write - and Felix will continue to be abroad mix of news, reviews, sport, features and opinion. TAKING RESPONSIBILITY\nUltimately, with power comes responsibility, and although most\nof the College would probably role of Felix Editor \" power\", I 'll\nhappily take all manner of abuse, blame and condemnation However, wh i 'st it's all very\nwell to moan to your friends\nabout the state of Felix or the College or the Union or whatever\nyou've at least tried to make ad if ference. You don't have to change the world, devote every waking hour to writing wrongs or come just have to try a little. So, come in\nand pester me about articles you want to write about your pet pro j ect, go and badger the sabbat i you in the Union, or get together\nII out of your\nand irritate the hell <\nSenior Tu'or or Head of Depart ment. Then you can comeback and complain until you' re blue in\nthe face, and I promise that I 'll listen and try to solve all your problems. Now, have we got a deal? Dave\n\n"

This eagerly\nawaited album is the first cut from his new\nlabel G Funk. The West side influence has\ngiven his laid back flow a rougher edge. New label he might have but he's still down with his\nold crew, laying down track after track with\nNate Dogg. The two were the perfect complement back in the day giving us such HipHop classics as Regulate, but time has seen\nthem evolve into different artists and now the\npairing can only produce the industry standard collaboration where random bodies\nfrom the same label flip lyrics over the mic. Fortunately the single release off this album/ Want It All leaves us in no doubt Warren G can still operate in a hook-up, as he and Mack10 flow through their takeover of the\nmaterial world. No doubt with his new label\nalongside his new status he'll soon be getting\n\"money, fast cars, gold chains and champagne, shit every damn thing\".\nAmongst others the G master has summoned Snoop, Kurupt and Slick Rick to the mic. The\nSo So Def connection is there in the form of\nJermaine Dupri who adds his clean cut lyrics\nto Havin' Things. This tune shows off the G's production skill z as he blends some of the\nEastside's smoothest artists in a tune which\ndescribes his down-low approach to the\nmusic business. Just like the man says \"ain't nothin' changed\", this album is much like his\nprevious cuts. A couple of the tracks such as\nthe tribute to his mother show how he has\ndeveloped while we've all been waiting.\nRather than the re-birth Gangsta so badly\nneeds, Warren G has refused to leave the old\nskool, rhyming about the dollars, the dope and the dealers. That said, it's good to hear\nto from the man wh o funked up hip hop. AWOL Tha Bomb - Phat Boy Thin Milen Is Back!\nTick, Tick, Tock Boom! What'sUP!

But rather than rant and rave on their slackness on tickets I'm gonna have ago at the event. For the second year in a row Mel BorG, you know Scan/, was hosting the\nevent, you'd think they would to learn from their mistakes no. Mel was her usually truly scary self and was literally jumping out of her dress,\nyeah she decided to follow Geri's advice and let it all hang out. Wyclef\nlooked like he was on speed the entire time, but was at least funny and would have done better with anyone else by his side. The worse person\non the night was Patsy Palmer, you know that annoying thing from Eastenders, she was so fucking irritating I just wanted to slap her. Once again the music saved the entire event with the cream of British talent\ndoing their thang, Kele Le Roc rocked the place with the Honey zand Beverly Knight stole the show. Those of you who where around last year\nmight remember that yours truly was able to scam an interview with Beverly and told her back then that she had to win some sort of award. A year afterwards it happens....I'm just too good at this!\nThe biggest news of the summer was the supposed break-up of Blackstreet. Since their third album dropped last year there have been rumours floating about because of the way it was received, the thing\nsank like the Titanic. Teddy Riley was said to have been ready to jack it\nall in after the label started getting on their backs about it. Then news\nbroke that Cha unc ey 'Black' Hannibal was actual iy gay, more rumours\nthat Teddy had ask Cha unc ey to leave the band were denied by\nCha unc ey but never by Teddy. Interscope ended their relationship with\nTeddy Riley's Lil Man Records and Teddy has announced he's giving\nBlackstreet a break to work on the Guy Reunion project. The situation is\nall in the air, but it's obvious that something's not right. The new Guy joint is due out in November. Quick bit of news you all should have heard of Rodney Darkchild Jerkins, the boy is probably the busiest, and definitely up there with the\nbest, producers in the business. Everyone knows the Darkchild working away on the new Michael Jackson album, but it has come to light that\nhe's also working with our very own Spice Girls on their new joint. Oh dear! This could be the worst decision of his life. Laterz.\nMii en Summer\nSinters\nYou didn't buys these?\n... Fools, these are the tunes\nof the summer and you not\nlet them pass you by!!!\nMissy Elliot - All N My Grill\nWith a voice like this why\ndoes she rap at all? Missy\nElliot is not an artist to be\nignored. Nas - Hate Me Now\nSuch a tune, you can't hate\nthis. Nas hit it LARGE with\nthis one and it's one I love\n702 - Where My Girls At\nTune nuff said\nNaughty by NatureJamboree\nIt's ajam, jam, jam and its\nnaughty, naughty, naughty.\nThese boyz rock.\nWild Wild West - Will Smith\nWicky, wick y, wild wild! You\nhave to love Mr Smith.\nDestiny's Child - Bug A Boo\nPhat track, gonna be hot,\nHot, HOT! Gang Starr - Full Clip\nLyrics galore, you know the\nscore from the ghetto royalty\nof the rap world. They put in\na wicked performance at this\nsummer' sCream fields as\nwell.\nMobb Deep - Quiet Storm\nDarker than black from the\nlords of hard hip hop. Mob b Deep hit it hard over the\nsummer with their Mur daM uzi k album, and this was the top track. It's got a White\nLines sample on it as well.\nNice. Maja "

    "content": "25 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Games\nGoldeneye\n(N64 budget)\nreact\nTraitors Gate\n(PC)\nRug rats\n(N64)\nIt's debatable whether Nintendo can really call a game 'budget' when the reduced retail price still weighs in at a hefty \u00a330,\nbut at least N64 owners cannot grumble about the quality of the titles available in\nthis range - they are all unquestionably\nfirst-class, crowned by the classic Goldeneye. The film was good, introducing a new Bond, a new era. The game, which\nis only available for the N64( much to the\nannoyance of the PC and Playstation\nfaithful), is better. In fact it is quite superb.\nUpon its release Goldeneye was hailed as\nthe pinnacle of the first-person adventure\nshooter genre, if not the entire games market, and to this day there have been few games to challenge for its title.\nTaking up 0 0 7 ' s role from the comfort of\na warm room may sound encouraging, but sadly the perks of the job aren't included - you're out to complete missions, not\nearn bucket loads in casinos whilst sur-rounded by beautiful women. Generally speaking, Goldeneye bowls\nyou over not from any single aspect of its\namazing game-play, but rather the professionalism and quality that endorses its\nevery detail. Each mission asks you to perform certain tasks that will not only\nrequire the pummelling of enemy guards\nbut also the use o Of stealth and initiative.\nThe huge variety of weapons come complete with an aiming sight, often tele s cop ic, allowing you to pick off targets from a distance with one shot to the head. Such is Goldeneye' s quality, it could well\nmake you go out and buy the console for\nthis game alone. After all, that's what I did... Viv \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPlaying Traitors Gate, you really have to wonder how the hell a group of intelligent people could spend two years of their lives writing a game that is quite so boring.\nThe basic premise of the game is that you have to sneak into the Tower\nof London and steal the Crown Jewels without being detected. The gameplay style is similar to puzzle games such as Myst and Monkey Island - the player walks around an essentially static landscape, solving\npuzzles and collecting objects in order to achieve your goal. The whole game is actually pre-recorded on the four game CDs when you click somewhere in order to move or interact with your en v iron ment, the game finds the appropriate movie file and plays it back for\nyou. What this means is that you spend all your time moving the mouse cursor round the screen until you find something interactive like an open door or an object, and then clicking on it to see what happens. This is certainly not my idea of fun.\nI have to admit that I didn't actually play all that much of Traitors Gate before writing this review. This was in part to do with a bug in the game that meant every so often when I saved a game I wouldn't be able to\ninteract with anything an dI'd have to go back to my last saved game or start again. But the main reason I gave up so early on was that Traitors Gate is boring. The game pauses slightly in between each location, even if you disable the animated transitions, which is irritating to say the\nleast. Some different locations are actually identical to each other,\nmaking it very hard to tell if you have actually moved anywhere or not.\nAnother problem is that despite the fact that all the locations are prerendered and prerecorded, the graphics still aren't very good. It's kind\nof like playing one of those early computer role playing games from about ten years ago. The puzzles themselves aren't bad as computer game puzzles go, but the enforced linearity of the game is extremely\nrestrictive.\nThe only possible reason I can think of for writing the game in a pre-recorded video format is that it's much easier to program. If it was written using a decent 3 d graphics engine, with an interactive environment and the ability to walk where you want, it might have been much more\nfun. Of course, this would have taken much more time and effort, but\nthen that is what it takes to write a good computer game these days. As it stands, the game engine is far too annoying to allow the game itself\nto be any fun whatsoever.\nBen\nChuckie, Phil, Lil, Angelica and the nappy gang pop into 3 dimensions to facilitate a not un slick weirdo type board gaming flash-back to my younger Christmases. One has the opportunity to force the little\nb lighters around3 boards in\nthe aim of performing such\ntasks as hunting for treasure,\nscoffing cookies( 'Part of\nevery square meal') or digging up a short green dinosaur's stash of hidden candy. The' fun' lasts\nbetween 20 minutes and an hour, depending onboard and tolerance size, and up to 4 gamers can be accommodated on the board at\nany one time without nee ding four controllers\nTo be fair I can see that kids\nwill beam used by their\nheroes for a while, but wouldn't they be better off\nlearning how to read rather\nthan basic joy pad skills. A novel cutting edge experience for gamers? No. A gift\nfor relatives between the age of 2 and8? Maybe. A set of\ncult figures cashing in on a so-so inane N64 game? a You n gimpy brats will be the\njudges.\nChris "

    "content": "26 Fiction Felix \u2022 25 October 1999\nNight Swimming\nY T he ocean carried on in all directions and dis-appeared below the curve of the earth. Night had fallen many hours ago and the Pacific\nwaters were smooth and silent, undisturbed by\nwind or creature. Above the stars shimmered brilliant-ly, un defied by human light. The moon too had risen,\na thin sickle that shone with unaccustomed brightness,\nits un lit portion being the only truly black piece of the\nsky \u2014 a dark oval amongst the countless pinpoints\nand milky smudges of the stars.\nBarely noticeable amongst the emptiness of the ocean and the crowded ness of the sky there floated a man. He is alive and conscious but he is losing these\ntwo qualities slowly and surely. His eyes are swollen\nalmost shut and the whites have assumed the colour of dark blood. His face is terribly burnt from the tr op ical sun and his lips are swollen and d is coloured, sur-rounded by a halo of crystallised salt. His tongue is so\nthick that he cannot breath through his mouth. His name is Sean, and he was a research assistant\non a vessel which sank in a typhoon twenty miles to the east. He is almost certain that he is the only sur-viv or. Around his inert form is tied a frayed and faded life jacket, the bulk of it being a large polystyrene\nblock which is attached to his chest, and the rest of it\na thick collar which just manages to keep his lolling\nhead above the water Attached to the main float\nthere is a small salt-water-activated light that had ceased its glow many hours ago, and a whistle which\nis tied with a thin nylon cord and floats a small dist ance away.\nOnly yesterday morning he had still been calculating how much longer he could survive without\nwater but now even that had ceased to be of interest.\nEverything that is real is retreating into a diffuse mist\nof unreality: his terrible thirst, the pain from his eyes\nand his blistered face, everything is getting less imp or tant somehow. He can still feel these sensations but\nthey seem far away, belonging to another version of himself. Even his memories have grown dim: they are\nsterile and dusty pictures in his mind, no longer emotive. It seems the whole course of his life is fading to black and white. Earlier he had discovered that he could no longer remember his telephone number but\neven that had failed to arouse any emotion in his\nsluggish mind. Still, one memory alone remains clear in his head one streak of colour amongst the shadows. It is\nstrange that it should be this one episode in his life\nthat is staying with him the longest, and yet in a way\nhe knows it is inevitable too. It was one day from a summer five years ago..., no not a day, but one night.\nIt began with a knock on his front door( there was\nno bell). Sean was in the kitchen, but what he was doing before or what he had done earlier that after-noon he has no recollection of.\nHe was expecting no one and tried to catch a glimpse of his visitor from the window but all he saw\nwas a flash of yellow material. A skirt maybe? He walked to the door and pulled it open. It was seven\no 'clock in the evening.\n\"Hi.\" Said the woman who stood on his doorstep.\n\" CHRIS!\" he a/ most shouted it. \"YOU! I wasn't expecting...! mean...! thought you were...you said... \"\nhe lapsed into silence and a lame grin which made bis\ncheeks hurt.\n\"I told you I'd call on you.\" She lean t forward and\npecked him on the cheek. Her smile dazzled: all perfect teeth except for her upper right incisor which was\nslightly too short so that you could see her tongue.\n\"You obviously don't take me very seriously. Look,\"\nshe gestured to something at her feet, \"I 've got it all\npacked...now all I need is your contribution.\"\nOn the ground was a massive basket, packed with\nall manner of things. Right on top was a big bowl of\nglistening lettuce, chopped onions and tomatoes.\n\"l... er...of course.\" Sean lapsed into his idiot's grin again. \"You want some wine, right?\"\nChris nodded solemnly. \"That was the agreement,\nremember? Me food, you wine.\"\n\"Yeah, me Tarzan, you Jane,\" said Sean and\nregretted it immediately. \"Til just get it...\" He said and\nfled into the house. He was muttering curses under his\nbreath as he entered the living room. On the big chest\nof drawers stood two bottles of wine, only there\nseemed to be four as they were right up against the\nbig mirror which reached to the ceiling. They were\nintended for his brother's birthday that Saturday and\nwere extremely valuable - they were from 1968, the\nyear of his brother's birth . Sean stood before the mirror and stared himself in the eyes. Slowly his hands\nreached for the bottles and a grin crept onto his face.\nForgive me, dear Brother, he said to his reflection.\nThen he grasped the wine and ran back to the front\ndoor where Chris waited.\nTriumphantly he presented her with both of the\nbottles. She took them and her brow creased as she\nread one of the faded and soiled labels.\n\"Monsieur,\" she said and her eyebrows rode\nslightly, \"I didn't realise that I meant this much too\nyou\".\n\"Oh!\" Sean laughed, maybe a little too loudly.\n\"Think nothing of it, Madame. I always keep a little\nsomething around for special occasions. Now come,/ am hungry.\" And with that he grasped the heavy basket and they both walked towards the path that led to\nthe sea.\nSean could not remember when he had first met\nChris. But he did know that he had seen her on more that five occasions before she appeared on his\ndoorstep that summer's evening. He also remembered very clearly that she had rendered him totally\nspeechless the first time he had laid eyes on her. She "

    "content": "25 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Books fly\nbooks =\nWar Zone, Alexander Stuart East and West, Chris Patten\nThis controversial book has just been republished, complete with the obligatory film diary to\ntie in with the recent release of Tim Roth's film\nadaptation.\nFrom the outset this novel has a shocking plot-line. An apparently 'normal' middle class family\nhas moved from London to tranquil Devon. Following a car accident, the mother gives birth on\nthe car seat without anaesthetic in front of her\nvoyeuristic family. The narrator of the novel is 1 5\nyear old Tom, a hostile, rebellious adolescent\nwho opposed the families' move by trying to\nburn down his school. Tom unexpectedly witnesses a possible sexual encounter between his\nfather and sister. After this discovery he is drawn\ninto an obsessive sexual game with his sister\nJessie as he attempts to discover the truth about\nhis family. This obsession eventually leads to violence as the family gradually breaks down. In a wider context, this can be seen as an allegory of\nthe materialism and greed inherent in\nThatcherite England.\nThe disturbing twist in this compelling story is\nthat Jessie is not a victim of incestuous abuse.\nOn the contrary she is the instigator of the relationship, seducing her father for the sexual chal-leng e. \"Incest is brilliant. It's scarier than shagging some Adam in a pub car park or stroking\nsome girl's thigh in some Fulham cafe\". Jessie is\nportrayed as a manipulative character, exploring\nthe dark side of her own sexuality. Aspects of this\ninclude as a do masochistic lesbian lover in London, with whom Tom loses his virginity and a local Buddhist boyfriend. The character of Jessie\nis unbelievable and as such weakens the credibility of the novel in my opinion.\nThis novel has amazing raw, visual imagery but\nis often sensationalist and incredibly shocking. It\nis a dark, claustrophobic novel with vivid\ndescriptions. However the subject matter is truly\ndisturbing so approach with caution.\nFormer Bath MR one-time Conservative Party chairman and Last British\nGovernor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten was, it seemed, headed for early\npolitical retirement. But with a first-rate CV, Patten need not have worried\ntoo much about his future, and began to write about the five years (I9921997) he governed Hong Kong. As things have turned out, Patten\nshouldn't have worried at all - he is now European Commissioner for Foreign Affairs. Look out for his book on Expanding Europe in five years or\nso.\nFrom the outset, Chris Patten tells us that his book is NOT: a) an autobiographical account of his life (I guess he will probably be doing that\nlater), b)a detailed account of his Governorship of Hong Kong, c)a book\nexaggerating or belittling East Asian Tiger values, or d) an economic textbook about East Asia.\nSo what is the book about then? That's what I had to read the book to\nfind out in this new, updated paperback edition of East and West. The first\npart is entitled 'Governing' and it tells the story of his five years as Governor. We are introduced very quickly to Patten's central belief that the\nChinese government is totalitarian and uses despotic techniques to deal\nwith its own people and foreign countries. We also become aware that as\nfar as Patten is concerned, the deceased British Empire was not an imperial force but an enlightening one. Further, we gather quickly that Patten\nsees liberal free market economics as the only way to go.\nIn the second part, 'The View From Hong Kong', he essentially tries to\nsubstantiate his argument that free economics should go hand in hand\nwith free politics. He takes a moderate position on the successes of the\nTiger economies, pointing out that it was inevitable that there would be a slowdown. We hop along from one East Asian country to the next while\nhe describes the politics as well as the economics of each.\nFinally, in the third part, 'Looking to the Future', he outlines his vision of\nthe twenty-first century. Surprisingly, he paints a rosy picture of East catching up with West, with both sharing good standards of living. He insists\nthat for this to happen certain matters of lack of political freedom and\nsocialist economics must wind down\nSurprisingly, Patten writes well for a politician, he is honest, light-hearted,\nand does not impress on us too much with flashy literary devices. It is his\nunderlying beliefs and ideas that come out clearest, which is a good\nthing. No wonder the China Daily wrote of his book: \".. .the portrait of a narrow-minded, retired politician who vents his spleen over those who\nopposed his perverse actions - extremely provocative language\".\nFight Club,\nChuck Palahniuk\nFor fans of the genre\npioneered by Douglas Coupland - Gen\nX angst - Fight Club is\na strong new add i tion. The story of a young white collar\nworker who is fed up\nwith his place in an\novertly materialistic\nsociety, Fight Club's characters answer is\nnot to sit around\nlamenting society's ills, but rather to\nmake the world a better place via blowing\nup office buildings.\nA very interesting\nread and a cool book\nstylistically. Buy it,\nread it, and then see\nthe movie.\nRussell\n2 0 % Off!\nEach of the books\nreviewed this week is\navailable from the\nWaterstones bookstore on Campus\n(beside the main\nlibrary) at a20% dis-count.\nEleanor Ahmed\n\n"

    "content": "28 Fiction Felix \u2022 25 October 1999\n\"Are you mad? It'll be freezing.\"\n\"No it won't be. The water retains the heat from\nthe day, in fact the water's warmer that the air right\nnow. Look, it's even steaming slightly.\"\nSean had to concede that the evidence was in her\nfavour, and apart from that, he knew from previous\nexperience that she was perfectly right.\n\"Well, I'm going, even if you're not,\" she said and\nstarted to undress. Sean watched in disbelief as she\nunashamedly pulled her dress over her head and cast\noff her underwear. He got up, slightly self-consciously.\nThey stared each other in the eyes, separated by\nmaybe two feet. Sean was making a heroic effort to\nprevent his eyes from wondering below her chin to\nwhere her bare skin gleamed in the fire-light. He\ncleared his throat but for once he could not think of a single appropriate word to say. Was it his imagination\nor was she breathing slightly more heavily?\n\"I 'll be waiting for you,\" she smiled and turned to\nwade into the water. Sean was glued to the spot, still\nspeechless.\n\"There's no stones out here,\" she called over her\nshoulder, \"only sand.\" He watched as the waters gradually inched up her legs, as her immaculate body rippled with the rhythm of her strides.\nSean was suddenly torn back into the present.\nHad he heard something? A gull? A horn? No, of\ncourse not. He was alone, and the only human being in five hundred miles. For some reason he was suddenly transported back to the shipwreck. How many days ago had it been? It had been a reasonably large boat,70 feet in\neng th with a crew of forty. Pacific Blade had been its\nname and now it wallowed in the mud at some unimaginable depth below the surface. Sean had intended to enter a lifeboat like all the others once the\nwater had begun filling the engine room. But barely\nhad he made it on to the deck that a wave had snatched him away like a leaf in a hurricane. Thank fully, he had put on a life jacket, but that was the last\nthing he contributed to his fate. Once in the sea his\nonly mission became trying to find the next breath of\noxygen in an ocean where the boundary between air\nand water had long been lost. The waves had tossed\nhim around as if he had been merely a matchstick\nand each moment he expected to be crushed against the ship's hull or eviscerated on some serrated reef.\nOnce only had he seen another shipmate, fleetingly at\nthe crest of a wave before they were torn apart again. Neither of them had communicated a thing, they had merely stared briefly into one another' s' terror is ed eyes and understood perfectly that human life was\ntotally without consequence in a situation like this.\nNature did as nature pleased and man would watch\nand live or watch and die, with no influence on the\noutcome whatsoever. Sean was lucky. Somewhere in\nthe Great Lottery of The Sky his numbers had come up\nand he lived.\nBut now he was dying again, and this time he\nthought it was for certain. He suddenly felt the need to\nurinate and was mildly surprised at how painful it was.\nHe realised that his body had no water left to flush his\nmetabolic toxins into the world. Slowly he retreated\nback from reality again and into his thought s.He watched Chris walking further and further into\nthe sea. The ground beneath her feet began to drop\naway more steeply and the water rose quicker up her\nbody. Her long black hair touched the surface and\nbegan to spread out like an oil slick. Suddenly Sean\nsprung into life. \"HANG ON!\" he shouted hoarsely,\n\"I'm coming!\" He began tearing off his clothes like a man possessed and finally stumbled into the water.\nChris was treading water further out, watching him. He\nran into the deep water, eventually falling in with an\nundignified flop. It was amazingly exhilarating and\nSean had to make an effort not to whoop like an\nlunatic. Suddenly the alcoholic apathy was gone and\nhe began swimming after Chris who had turned and\nwas moving through the water with the elegance and\nefficiency of a panther. She carried on swimming for a whole ten minutes and Sean was painfully aware of\nthe gap that opened up between them. Yet his pride\nprevented him from calling out and he struggled on\ndoggedly through the sea.\nEventually she stopped swimming and turned to\nwait for him. He was panting when he reached her\nand making a big effort not to think of f he black abyss\nthat must have been yawning beneath them. Slowly\nshe swam to close the remaining gap between them.\n\"Stop swimming,\" she whispered, \"I will hold\nyou.\" And so he did and those long sleek arms\nenclosed him and he had never felt more peaceful or\nsecure before in his life. The last thing she said was\nthe sea will keep its secrets.\"\nSean never saw her again after that night. She\nsaid that she would leave in the morning and that he\ncould not know why or where she was going, and that\nis exactly what happened. Somewhere in the sprawling Pacific Sean knew\nwith a sudden certainty that in the past five years he\nhad thought about her every single day. He had sincerely thought that he had gotten over her but only\nnow did he realise how utterly wrong he had been Several hours later the moon sank below the horizon and a faint glow in the east was casting the stars\nfrom the sky. An empty life jacket floated on the water,\ntrailing behind it a whistle that was bound to it with a nylon cord. The ocean was totally silent, undisturbed\nby wind or creature. It carried on in al! directions and disappeared at the unbroken horizon. It It would always keep its secrets.\nComments please\nEmail caspar.w rede@ ic.ac.uk\nThe End\n\n"

    "content": "36 Sport Felix \u2022 25 October 1999\nAy-car amba! Medics win Tries aplenty for seconds\nICSM Football Rugby\nSt .Bart's11 ICSM 1 10\nThe ICSM team lived up to its\nbilling as one of the favourites to\nwin UL Division One with an\nemphatic 1 0-1 away win in the first\ngame of the season against SBLH\n1 sts. The loss of several key players\nleft a somewhat depleted team with\na tricky away tie at Chislehurst\nagainst notoriously determined\nopposition. Once the game start-ed, however, there was little debate\nas to which was the stronger side\nand ICSM dominated. The amount\nof possession was not reflected in\nthe score line at halftime with ICSM\nonly winning 2 \u2014 0.\nThis was rectified in the second\nhalf as the Medics put 8 goals past\nthe helpless SBLH keeper. Adam\nHumphries made a notable 1st team debut on the left wing and\nJohn Williams made many penetrating runs from midfield. He was\neventually fouled on one of these\nruns resulting in a penalty that the\ncaptain Ned Carabine put away\nwith aplomb. SBLH never posed\nany danger up front and any\nattacks were nullified by the ICSM\ndefence and the impressive\nEamonn Rabie. The SBLH goal\ncame at the death as a header was\ndeflected past the keeper. This,\nhowever, could not be much of a consolation to them as the Medics\nscored goal after goal and hit the\nwoodwork twice.\nIC Ik...\nRUMS\n.65\nAfter a poor start to the season last\nweek with a narrow win against\nBrunei (I), the seconds soon hit top\nform. As the harsh winds of Harlington blew across the pitch and\nkick off drew near, the tension and\nanticipation soon rose. With the\nadvantage of the wind the medics\nwent into an early lead as the new\n2nds tried to gain some kind of\nshape in the forwards. Then as the\nbacks and forwards started to dominate all over the pitch, the score\nstarted to mount as the 2nds moved\nup a couple of gears, the first try\ncoming as Tim \"the Gay icon\"\nDenyer burst through their defence\nto score. Soon followed more tries\nfrom Flo and Rich Seppings but a lack of tackling ability let the medics\nscore with ease, leaving the score at\nhalf-time to be 31 -8 in our favour.\nAs the second half started, so the\n2nds started playing exhibition\nrugby with the backs playing golden\nrugby, more tries followed as the\nforwards secured good ball to allow\nthe backs to score almost every time\nthey gained possession. As the\nscore rose so did the 2nd sag gres sion, managing to reduce their\nteam to 1 3. After repeated pleas for\nmercy, the ref gave in and called\ntime with 20 minutes still on the\nclock. In the end, \"the gay icon\" led\nwith five tries and Flo was just\nbehind with four.\nMens Football\nDisco boys destroy GKT\nHockey - Disco Squad\nGKT 1 2\nIC 1 4\nThe only phrase to describe this\nperformance would be aerial dominance with 3 of the 4 IC goals\ncoming form our boy'sb once s. A new system was needed following the absence of Nak and\nSteve, and it took us a little time to\nadapt allowing GKT to score a sloppy first goal. However, this did\nnot knock us off track, as we started to pass the ball around well in\nthe midfield. The first goal came\nfrom a nice move involving Juan\nand Dave and Alex nodded the ball\nover the stranded keeper.\nAfter this it was all IC and we\ntook the lead before the break\nthanks to a storming header form\nTony. The ball was whipped over by\nWarren and Tony managed to head\nthe ball and take two defenders\nand put them all in the back of the\nnet.\nIn the second half the difference in class was obscene, Dan\nextending the lead, with another\nheader from Jamie's cross.\nWhining Warren scored the\nfourth after a move that involved\nmost of the team. By the time they\nscored their second, the game was\nwon.\nUCL 1 2\nIC 1 1\nGutted! Absolutely gutted. IC\nplayed like champs for most of the\ngame and took the lead after a UCL defender steered in Warren's header. We created a few other\nhalf-chances, but failed to find the\ntarget.\nWith 15 mins to go we were\nstill in control when a forward was\nallowed to stroll through the mid-field/defence and hit a lame shot\nthat squirmed through the bewildered keeper.\nThings went from bad to worse\nwhen another defensive mix up\nallowed them to get the winner with\nabout 7 mins left.\nIC III 9\nGKT III 0\nWhat can I say, another Wednesday, another BUSA fixture, another\ncrushing victory.\nIt seems the Disco Lads barely\nmissed their gallant heroic (and\nreally rather attractive) leader\nFabio, in what was a most decisive\nresult. Tong the keeper was kept\nbusy by the subs whilst the remaining 10 men spent the entire game\nhacking the opposition to death in\ntheir D. The disco short corner routine\nis coming on well this season and\nof the 750 short corners so far,\nMammers finally converted one to\nopen his account. The first half\nwas comfortable but highlighted\nby one simple moment of utter\nglory.\nIn the midst of a goal-line\nscrabble the ball came loose to\nPrelapsed Bowel (lain Pyle) at the\ntop of the D. He entered the\nchannel of Love. With palm sweating and his shaft throbbing he\nswung and shot his load into the\ngoal. The back-board exploded\nin a thr ii ling climax to the half and\nas he milked the last drops of joy\nit was clear we were on to a win-ner.\nAt the half we were up 5 to nil,\nthe tally, 2 to Mammers, 2 to Jesus\nand 1 to the man of the match,\nPrelapse. The second half was\ntypical Disco. Not elegant but\nbrutally (yes, you Mammers) efficient. Four more beauties flowed\nfrom the stick of the sundance kid,\nnone from a yard but who cares, it\nwas another moment of Disco\nglory so come on then, who's next.\n\n"

If you haven't seen this pair of films\nbefore( Why not?), then now is your chance. Both are spoof spy films with Mike Myers ta king more than one role and they also star Liz\nHurley and Heather Graham. Admittedly, they both try the same jokes and sometimes the gags are dragged out too long but it's sure to make you laugh. Wayne' s World and Austin Powers II are being shown on Tuesday26 October. Wayne' s World( in case you've forgotten) is about two guys ( Wayne and Garth) who produce aTV show from Wayne' s house. They make it big time only to decide that it just isn't the same. Hilarious from being to end with a cameo from Alice Cooper. Definitely one to watch again and again and... In conjunction with RAG, ICU cinema is\nshowing Scream for Halloween(31 October in case you're not sure) with all proceeds from this showing going to RAG to help with their\ncharity work.S cream is an ace film about someone who has taken their love of scary\nfilms way too far. This film will make you laugh and jump. This is such a worthwhile event that will leave you feeling good about helping a charity so leave that piece of coursework and gel to the Union. Make sure you check the posters on the walk way for the exact times and details of ail the films being shown this week. Due to the kind courtesy of the promoters of 'The Blair Witch Project', Film Felix has a goody bag to giveaway and( you've guessed it) all you have to do is answer a question. The prize includes a Blair Witch rucksack containing a Blair Witch T shirt, CD, book and badge.

After Mulan, they've rethought their\napproach and they are finally getting back the magic that makes these films memorable for all the right reasons. The animation is\nstate of the art and completely breathtaking. Using a new technique called Deep Canvas the characters come alive and it is difficult at\ntimes to remember that it is just a cartoon. At last, Disney has got rid of the cheesy songs and about time too. Instead, Phil Collins warbles in his distinctive tones as background music and the effect works well. Most people know the story of Tarzan in one form or another and this time Disney has stuck to the original story by Edgar Rice Burr ough s. A shipwrecked family land in a remote place, parents die and gorillas bring up the human child as their own. Tarzan always feels that he doesn't quite fit in, which is no surprise since he's not a gorilla. That is\nuntil one day human explorers stumble across the gori lias' nest and Tarzan realises\nthe brutal truth for himself. Shock horror, he\nisn't really a gorilla. The characters are so de ii cio us ly heart war ming and as for the evil bad die, Clayton, well\nyou just want to boo him off the screen. The voices supplied to these animations belong to, amongst others, Brian Blessed, Nigel Hawthorne, Minnie Driver and Glenn Close. All of them provide a brilliant performance especially Minnie Driver who ad lib s one of her speeches and the result is fan ta stic. When you go and see this film ( and you know you want to really!) make sure you watch out for familiar looking characters from previous Disney Classics. Helen "

I 've got PR people\non my back, and disp point ed writers at my throat.\nOkay then, shut up James,\nlet the reviews begin...\nSlick Sixty - Nibs and Nabs\nMusic that could easily\ncoerce you onto an empty\ndance floor.

It's all gone a bit\ntasha really...\nIs that alright? Bye Bye\nNitin Sawhney\nBeyond Skin\n(Outcaste)\nThere are some albums which are good. There are some albums\nwhich are bad. Some are just okay. There are also albums which\nmake you feel good or bad, provoking a reaction in some way. Then\nthere are the rarest of all. Albums which are sublime.\nThis album was first sent to the frequency office as an album-sam-p ler. It was my turn to open the mail that day, so I just put it on the\npile with the rest, not expecting much. I had a cursory listen to the\nusual batch of lame indie tracks with no imagination and no soul.\nThen I slipped the tape in. Within five minutes I had called the label\nand demanded a full review copy, and selfishly hid the album to\nreview myself. Yes, I know it's pathetic but I had to have this work of\nart.\nThis isn't just an album of beautiful beats, ele gent melodies and\npainfully soul full vocals - its also full of messages. Nitin talks about\nmany subjects close to his heart, the current political situation in\nIndia and Pakistan, his parents move to London, their hopes and\nfears for the future and the eventual integration of East and West.\nThis album made me feel ashamed that I had not previously actively sought out the huge amount of music coming from all the many\ncommunities in the UK - and not realising how much we have to\nlearn from each other - and how great it can be (and how good it\ncan sound!), when everyone works together.\nBack to the album. If I was forced to pick highlights, Letting Go, Homelands and Nadia would be the ones I simply could not do with-out. Letting Co has Tina Grace sing an touchingly delicate and razor\nsharp vocal over a subtle blend of Spanish guitar, various drums and\nan inc read i blu relaxing backdrop of crackly vinyl. A real heart ren-de rer. Homelands has the entire 4 hero string section helping out and\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan's nephews chanting the main vocals. A spine\nshaking percussive menage ry lifts you up and won't put you down.\nNina Miranda of Smoke City leans in to with a refrain in Portugese\n- 'Fragile is the land, and so are the minds of men'. Nadia means\nThe River1\n, the vocalist sings in the thu mri style to help create a feeling of fluid m ov ment relentless jung list beats don't do any harm\neither.\nfw:fk\nNine Inch Nails\nThe Fragile\n(Nothing)\nGet this album today - you'll still be listening to it next year.\nJoel\nThe Fragile is the latest top- quality offering\nfrom Nine Inch Nails sole-member, Trent\nReznor. It's subtitled Halo Fourteen, being\nthe fourteenth proper NIN release in\nReznors peculiar numbering system, and for\nyour money you get two CDs with over two\nhours of music. Further, the CDs come in a beautiful gate fold pack with the CDs laid\nout next to each other imaginatively labelled\nleft and right.\nleft begins with Somewhat Damaged, a powerful and chugging tune. Then there's a couple more sonic delights, and the remainder weave into a clanking, grinding collage\nof tunes, with The Great Below providing a graceful exit. Right is a little shorter but it\ndoesn't suffer in quality. More electronic\nand distinctly less mainstream than Left, it\nrewards the listener's perseverance with\nsome great tracks. Into the Void and Starfuckers Inc. deserve mention for their powerful beats and vocals. Ripe (with decay) is\nas soulful as it is eerie.\nThere's a distinct splitting of musical style\nbetween Left and Right. Whereas Right\nseems more in the tradition of NIN's style,\nLeft sounds more like mainstream hard\nrock. As you would expect the production\nand mixing is slick and you have to be listening with a very good sound system or\nheadphones to catch the clever subtleties\ninherent in the recording. This is an album\nthat should appeal to a wider audience than\nNIN's hardcore fanbase. Personally, I haven't listened to anything else this week.\nAny open-minded person unafraid of loud\nand heavy music should take a good look\nat this.\nHardy\n!\u2022\n\n"

Tasting Notes\nWeek Four : Under the Grill\nThe Basic Skill\nGrilling\nIn the last three weeks, we've covered boiling, frying and baking.\nThis week, we look at the last basic\nskill, grilling. By the end of the term,\nthis column will have covered everything you need to cook a full\nChristmas dinner. There's still a long way to go! When food is grilled, the liquid\nwithin evaporates upwards. At the\ntop it hits direct heat from the grill,\nand when this liquid caramel is es the food turns brown. Browned\nfood looks and tastes great. The flip\nside is that grilling dries food out,\nloosing flavour and roughening tex-ture.\nMany people cook food too close. A good distance between the\nheat source and the top of the food is 1 0 cm. You may want to move a little closer if the food is very thin,\nor further away if it is very thick. If\nfood is too close, you choose between burning the top, and not\ncooking the middle. Too far away,\nand the food will not brown.\nFood should cook with a steady\nsizzle, and brown slowly. If the food is cooked too slowly, it will just stew\nin its own juices, and you might as\nwell have used a sauce pan! Meal Suggestion\nSpicy Fish\nIam a huge seafood fan. So far,\nthis column has avoided fish, so I thought I'd make up for lost time\nnow. Fish is expensive, but worth\nevery penny in my opinion. This is\nreally simple, and tastes great.\nMany people dislike eating whole\nfish, or even fish with the skin on. You can make this with almost any\ntype or cut of fish. Best is a whole\nwhite flat fish, such as skate. Thicker fish will work, but you should be careful to cook it well.\nIf you are using whole fish, start\nby cutting several deep gashes in\neach side. Mix a teaspoon of garam masala powder with a cou ple of tablespoons of olive oil per fish. Rub this mixture over the fish,\nthen place in an oven proof dish, or on a baking tray.\nGrill for about 1 0 minutes. The\nheat of the dish will cook the under-side, so there's no need to turn.\nAdvanced Tip\nSpectacular cheese on toast\nI don't expect you to believe this\nrecipe will work. When a friend\nmade it, I was certain it would be a disaster, so I claim absolutely no credit. It sounds strange, because it\ninvolves grilling salad, but works\nreally well. The end result is truly\nspectacular; real posh food on a budget.\nMost people make cheese on toast by slapping a big lump of\ncheese on bread, and grilling hard\nuntil it is melted. The secret here is\nto use \" a small amount of grated\ncheese. The grill is used at a low\nheat for a few minutes only, until the\ncheese has mostly melted.\nStart with centimetre thick slices\nof good bread. Grill one side\nbriefly, until it goes hard, but barely\nbrown. Turn the bread, and spread\nthinly with butter. Now, start to build. Your aim is to create some thing which sticks up an inch above the bread. Arrange a some green\nsalad leaves on each slice, just\nenough to vaguely cover the whole\nslice. I normally use something with\na bit of flavour. Rocket, or watercress are ideal. Whatever you choose, it has to look good. Place a couple of bits of sliced\ntomato and maybe some mush-room, or red peppers over the\nleaves on each piece of bread, then\nadd the cheese. You should either\ngrate, or chop very finely. About30 g per slice is needed, and it\ncould be almost anything. Combi nations are great, so this is ideal for\nusing up whatever you have about.\nWhen your masterpiece is complete, stick it under a really slow\ngrill. After a few minutes, the cheese\nshould have melted enough to lie is\nstrands over everything. In this brief\ntime, the salad leaves will wilt slight-ly, but not enough to turn to mush.\nFinish off by sprinkling herbs\nover the top, together with a twist of\nblack pepper.\n\n"

    "content": "El Big issue Felix \u00ab 25 October 1999\nBUSA - The Real Deal\nTIM TRAILOR\nICU Deputy President (Clubs\n& Societies)\nFor those of you who don't know anything about the British Universities Sports Association( or BUS A for short) it is the competition that\nmost of our sports clubs compete in every Wednesday afternoon. Because IC merged with St Mary's and Charring Cross we have found ourselves with effectively\nthree lots of sports teams each of whom would normally enter BUS A. These have been combined into two sets of team sICS M( containing the old St. Mary's and Charring Cross teams) and IC. But big debates have been raging over the past few years about how we should proceed from here. At present there are three main possible directions in which we could proceed: Single Entry\nThis is where I Can dIC SM would also be merged and for each sport IC would only field one set\nof teams. All medics who play\nsport would have to do so as part\nof a combined IC team. Dual Entry\nThis is where IC and ICS M both\nenter completely separately and no medic can represent IC instead they must play for ICS M. Where ICS M doesn't have a team, medics cannot compete in BUS A. Hybrid Entry\nThis is the current situation. Both\nIC and ICS M can enter teams and medical students can choose which side to play for( yes, medics can play for IC even if ICS M has a team). However, an on medic cannot elect to play for the med ical school however.\nBackground info\nAt present the University of London universities are allowed to use the hybrid system because BUS A acknowledged the unique situation we were facing with lots of medical schools being swallowed up by the big colleges. However BUS A have asked us to come up with another alternative by March2001. Single entry has the advantage of increasing the sense of belong ing to IC within the medical community and will ultimately produce stronger teams. It would also allow a team to be fielded in sports\nwhere neither IC no rIC SM could field separate teams. Only a limited number of teams from each institution can enter anyone event in BUS A every\nyear, (eg noone institution can field more than three rugby teams in BUS A). Therefore if I Can dIC SM were to be entered as a single institution we would only be able to field half as many teams as we do at present.\nDual entry would mean that\nwe would still be able to have the\nsame number of people participating as we do at the moment. The standard would remain larg ely the same as at present but this\nsystem could be divisive if used on along term basis because I Can dIC SM players would never get to play together. Also where there is\nno medic team, medics would be unable to participate in the sport\nand vice versa; this is the case even when the other institution is\nstill able to field a team. Hybrid entry would, in my view, be the idea solution. This\nwould allow individuals that right\nto choose and would result in\nsome integration between medics and non medics. I believe that\nover a number of years this would see a gradual strengthening of the\nIC side as medics started to see IC as a viable team to opt to play for,\nbut it would also allow for recognition of the history medic sport is\nbased on. This option would ensure a maximum level of participation whilst not preventing a gradual positive shift in standard. The downside to h\\ybrid is simply\nin that BUS A might reject it - they\nhave already asked the London division to review their entry proto cols and to put forward a new proposal, if that new proposal is\nnot sufficiently different from the current one we might find it being rejected by BUS A. The story so far\nBack in December1997, ICU council voted to opt for single\nentry for the next season(19981999). However, the following January an800 name petition was raised calling for an emergency meeting. At this meeting ICU council's last decision was over\nturned and at the following Council meeting ICU agreed to imp le ment hybrid entry for the following season, moving toward single entry for the start of the 2 0 0 1 season. Since January1998 the rest\nof the London division( University\nof London colleges) has decided to opt for Dual entry in September2001. The situation is under continual review and Iam currently\ninvolved in UL U discussion forums on the matter. The ICU decision made two years ago is still the official ICU policy; this is a fairly fluid\nsituation and it is quite possible that by September2001 ICU will\nbe supporting a different option. Any decisions relating to the BUS A entry need to betaken through ICU Council and thus if you are interested in this topic you will\nhave your chance to have your\nopinions heard. I will also state\nquite clearly and openly that\nshould any such subjects be tabled for discussion at ICU Council I will\ndo my best to make sure you know when, where and how to give your\nviews on the matter.\nIam sure that any of you who play sport have a view on this subject and I would be interested in\nhearing from anyone with anything\nconstructive to say( especially if\nthey can come up with a fourth\noption). If you would like to discuss\nthis, or any other clubs and societies related, matter with me then\nyou are most welcome to come and see me(I am at the back of\nthe Union office every day from10 am onwards). WANTED ICU REQUIRES\nUNION STEWARDS\nIF YOU ARE GOOD WITH PEOPLE,\nCALM UNDER PRESSURE, ENTHUSIASTIC,\nOUTGOING AND WILLING TO WEAR GREEN\nTHEN YOU COULD BE THE PERSON\nWE ARE LOOKING FOR.\nFOR MORE DETAILS CONTACT m. horne@ic.ac.uk\nOR RING 0207 594 8068 (48068)\nINTERVIEWS WILL BE HELD WEEK BEGINNING NOV 1ST "

    "content": "25 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Sport 35\nLadies off to better start IC shoot to win\nFencing Basketball\nAfter what could be considered a disappointing season last year, IC\nLadies Fencing team got off to a good start this season, beating UCL108. We were prepared for strong\nopposition, having remembered f he team they had last year, but we also\nthought that we could be in with a chance to take the match.\nFirst we fenced the foil, with\nCaptain Katherine winning all three\nof her fights in excellent style.\nLeucha won two of her fights, and Annie put in a great performance,\nconsidering she hasn't fenced for 1 8\nmonths, but although there were a couple of close fights, she didn't manage to win a fight. That gave us\na54 lead going into the e pee, which meant that to avoid either losing or drawing the match we had to\nwin the e pee too. We were hopeful going into the\ne pee, and Captain Katherine and Leucha each won their first fight, giving us a20 start. Our excellent\ncaptain went on to win both her\nother fights, the last one securing\nthe match before we'd even fin-is he d. Clare fenced well, but had rarely fenced e pee before and didn't manage to take a fight. Leucha won one of her other two fights and IC\ntook the match 1 0-8.\nRumours abound that there are\na couple of good fencers out there\nwho haven't turned up yet, and also\nthat UCL would be our most difficult\nmatch, so with the possibility of a stronger team later in the season,\nwe face our next match with our confidence high.\nKing's56 Imperial.... 6 2\nTraditionally, the first match of the\nseason has never been very good for the mens firsts, and today was no exception.. That wasn't because Kings played well, despite their new\ntalent, but because we were still\nsuffering from not enough practice\nover the summer. We managed to\nbeat ourselves on several occasions, at one point being out-jumped by a3 ft point-guard on the Kings team. The game was pretty even\nthroughout, with Kings leading for most of the game. This was due mainly to our inability to rebound the ball or put shots in, despite\nhaving an average height about half a foot bigger than our opponents. As the game went on\nthough, certain players picked up\ntheir game, and made key contributions that kept us in contention\nfor victory.\nOf particular note were Adam,\nKK and Ellias from last year, as well\nas James and Franck who have\njoined us this year. They all played\nexceptionally well, and helped us\nto pull away in the final minutes as\nKings fell apart. Our composure\ntowards the buzzer was certainly a marked improvement on last year.\nThe team still has a lot of work\nto do before we can consider the\ndizzy heights of Oxford, but things\nare certainly looking good for the\nplay-offs. With any luck, we should\nhave a very good season.\nTrip to Coleraine IN BRIEF\nSailing-June 17-20 1999\nAn intrepid collection of sailors and non-sailors massed in Southside on the evening of the 1 7th of June for the annual trip to the Coleraine24 hour race in Northern Ireland.\nImperial has been entering the event for27 consecutive years and our attendance is highly valued. The format of the race is that a boat is kept sailing for24 hours\nfrom 2 pm Saturday to 2 pm Sunday with pit stops for crew changes etc.\nas many times as required/ wanted in that time.\nIt was decided that we would enter one serious(is hl) team and one really not very serious at all\nteam into the event this year.\nFinally the sailing started. The first team had a good start but then\nlost a load by putting up their spinnaker when they'd forgotten how to\nfly one. Can't remember about the\nsecond team. Right from the start it\nwas clear that our main rivals were\ngoing to be a team of people from\nStrathclyde who took it all far too seriously. A rule was instigated\nwhere for the evening the second team had too take a four pack out with them, to be consumed whilst\nsailing. The first team were racing\nround in or near to first place, whilst the wind started to drop in\nthe evening. Some highly amusing spectator sport was to be had by\nwatching Sarah trying to steer a boat instead of a minibus, with Ben and her regularly swapping jobs\nand even more often to be seen\nswimming round the top of the\nmast, untying soggy wet spinnakers During the night the wind picked up, Simon and Alex rec or ded the fastest lap of the race, Oily and various helpers sailed round in\nlots of circles, with various appendages stuck to their heads,\nwithout actually completing a lap. They must have then got bored because the second team boat was seen to be pulled upon the beach for an hour or so whilst some other\npeople were woken up and per-sua ded to sail.\nIn the end the first team came second on handicap, despite completing more laps than ever completed before and being genuinely\nbrilliant. The second team didn't really rate in sailing terms at all, but\nthey also succeeded in terms of\nbeing gods, just in a slightly differ-ent, more hazy way.\nCD IC 2 9\nLSE 3 3\nLast year's match against our old adversaries LSE was a closely fought battle, and this year was no exception. The battlefield scene\nwas given extra flair with visual\neffects provided by Union Fire\nTraining who seemed to be celebrating Guy Falke's night early in\nthe basket ball courts directly\nbehind court. Thanks guys. Ever\nwondered if it might have been an advantage for us to breathe? So having played the first half through the smoke and against a back drop of flames, the score was balancing on a knife-edge at 1 8 1 8 . A lull in\nthe third quarter saw LSE take the\nlead 2 2 - 2 7 before the furious pace returned and the match finished in\nLSE's favour 2 9 - 3 3 . Definitely next\nyear LSE (you were lucky!). Next\nweek St. George's go girls!\nLadies Hockey\nIC I!7Q MW II 0\nDespite having 8 players, the\nmighty girls showed their stuff and stormed into the match. Encoura ged by their captains Ch under bird on the side ( hopping around on crutches) and telepathically by\nUnder down( at her deathbed). Tinky winky scored2 goals within\n15 minutes, and soon after Steph\nbrought the score to 3-0 with a superb hit. The girls were pleased\nat half time, having not experienced the feeling of leading at half\ntime (or full time last season). In the\nsecond half all the girls were on top form and4 more goals were\nscored,2 by Katie, 1 by Jo and1 by half-pint. After the match the\ngirls celebrated victoriously except\nfor Karen who complained she got bored being goalie. With jugs a plenty (2 for Tinky Winky, 2 for\nKatie, 1 for Jo and1 for Steph)\nwe're off to party but we'll be back.\nAlso Received\nCrossCountry IC in 3 rd,6 th,10 th,23 rd and28 th; IC Ladies\n2 nd,7 th,17 th Rugby - IC Ists 5 2 - 0 Brunei\n(played 1 3 / 1 0 / 1 9 9 9 )\nFootball - Goldsmiths3 rds13 IC\n3rds III; IC IV 5 - 4 ICS M IV; IC VI\n4 - 5 Kings VII ; IC VII 1 - 6 RCS I Sorry guys - run out of space!

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n25 October 1999 : Issue 1154\npass with Europlines\nSports Centre finally given Go-Ahead\nGARETH MORGAN The College's planned sports c en tre development has finally received planning permission from the City of London and West minster Council. The plans, which include a large sports hall, climbing wall, aerobics gym and accommodation, all built on top of the existing\ns por ts centre building, were approved at a planning meeting on14 October. Approval was conditional on several modifications, including changing the roof\nmaterial for the sports hall, as well\nas other details to be confirmed later.\nThese changes should not greatly affect the budget or time\nscale of the building work, which is due to start in Easter and last\napproximately eighteen months. There had been concern that\nprotests from residents would halt\nthe plans; this has been the fate of several proposals in recent years.\nICU's Deputy President ( Clubs and Societies), Tim Trailor, was pleased at the news, although he was worried about the disruption that the construction would cause. ICU is also concerned about the funding for the project.\n\"Part of the cost is budgeted to be paid for by the 'release' of Southside Gym[ the reallocation of the space], and there's also a plan to' rational is e' the sp or ts\ngrounds,\" Mr Trailor said. \"That\nsuggests that they [Estates] plan to sell Teddington, but the figure on the budget is more than Ted ding ton's value.\" He added that the Union would \"fight strongly\" to maintain the current sports' provision, and minimise the disruption to students and clubs using the fac ili ties. Potential users of the sports\ncentre are currently discussing their requirements for space and time, with the aim of maxim ising the potential benefit of the new facility to both students and societies. Unfortunately neither Ian\nCaldwell, the Director of Estates,\nnor Frank Murray, the Sports C en tre Manager, were available to speak to Felix. We hope to bring\nyou up to date with their side of this story next week. Union fiasco leaves expedition stores on the streets\nSUNIL RAO The Union's plans for expansion into the Beit Quad have opened up yet another can of worms, it\nhas been revealed. The expansion has nec ess it a ted the handing over of the space it used to occupy in the South wing of Beit, which, until the proposed move, was primarily used as storage space by various clubs and societies for large and bulky\npieces of equipment. However, a number of clubs have found themselves placed at serious inconvenience due to the bungling of the whole issue of relocation by the concerned Bessemer ready and waiting for equipment Photo: Jonas\nauthorities.\nThe discovery of asbestos in\nsome of the old South wing tunnels meant an early pack up for some of the clubs affected, but\nthe fact that the move was to take\nplace at the start of the summer holidays meant that those clubs that were away on tour at the time\nfound themselves in a mad rush\ngetting the move organised with\nthe equipment temporarily placed at the front of Beit owing to the discovery of asbestos in the South\nwing area tunnels. The outdoor club returned from their trip to\ndiscover their stuff dumped in a Conti ue don page3 "

    "content": "Music Felix \u2022 25 October 1999\nfrequency NA Add Nto X The Forum\n11th October\nI'd never been to the Forum\nbefore I went to see Add N to X and I can safely say that\nit's a very nice venue. None\nof your Wembley Arena\ncan't see-a damn-thing rub-b ish. No, this was a proper\ngig, with proper beer and\nlots of people in black Tshirts. Including the bald\none from Add N to X. Seeing Add N to X was\nanother first for me: I knew\na little of their music but I was keen to hear them live\nafter a friend of mine\nlabeled them \"mentalist s\". Quite. Add n to x proceeded to thrash up the\nstage for the next forty minutes with a vast array of\nbleep y noises, vo coders, thunderous drum beats and\nexperimental sounds. I particularly enjoyed the extensive use of Theremin, but\nthe audience as a whole\nwas unmoved, which is a shame because I am sure\nthat if most of the crowd\nsat down and listened to\nthem, they would really\nenjoy their distinctive\nsound.\nAdd N to X are not really a band suited to live per-form ance, but they are definitely one worth checking\nat home.\nChristian\nSkunk Anansie\nBrixton Academy\n19th October\nIf you hang around in the Felix office for long enough, people give you\nthings. Sometimes the flu'. In my case, it was a pair of tickets to see\nSkunk Anansie, in about two hours time. It's a hard life. Brixton Academy\nis huge - the biggest 'real' venue in London, and it was sold out. This\nmay have been the reason I was stuck up in the circle seating, but since\nI had a review to write I didn't mind too much.\nEwan McFarlene walked onto stage with only an acoustic guitar and a Scottish flag to cover his seat. He looked very small on the huge stage\nbut his voice made up for that. He played three powerful, emotional\nsongs, to a politely enthusiastic reception. Muse play fairly strange, noisy\nindie, with a hard edge and some impressively bizarre guitar sounds.\nTheir songs seemed fairly long, with some nice solos. Good vocals, even\nif I couldn't make out what they actually were. They pick up bonus points\nfor the stand-up bass, although their lack of visual performance doesn't do them any favours. The crowd seemed to enjoy it though, with a few\npeople bouncing away towards the end.\nThis was Skunk's homecoming gig after two and a half years away from\nthese shores, and they gave Brixton a show to remember. Opening with\nCharlie Big Potato they treated us to an hour and a quarter or so of undiluted entertainment. The whole band are a frenetic blur of energy. Guitarist Ace somehow manages to find the time between po going like a mad thing and throwing rock star poses to manipulate the twenty or so\nstomp boxes in front of him. Cass's bass and Mark's drumming are tight,\nvibrant and energetic, and. they're both in constant motion. The star of\nthe night though is vocalist Skin. As if her soaring, evocative and passionate voice wasn't enough in itself, she's a masterful front woman, teasing and coaxing the crowd into a frenzy while using every inch of the\nstage to its full potential. She spent a fair amount of time in the photo pit,\nlaying hands on the audience, and even, to the security's horror, manages a brief stage dive. Al! the classics are played, with older songs such\nas I Can Dream and closer Little Baby Swastikka getting as good a response as more recent material from their new Post Orgasmic Chill LP\nThere's constant motion and a steady stream of crowd surfers, especially for an the mic tracks like Twisted (Every Day Hurts) and Weak. The light\nand shade dynamics are well-executed, and five thousand or so people\nare baying for more as the main set closes.\nOne of the most spectacular and impressive gigs I 've had the pleasure\nof attending. Let's hope they're back soon.\nGareth\nRico\nElectric Ballroom\n14th October\nRico is making a name for himself as an\nintense, uncompromising rock act. After\nworking with various bands, Rico went\nsolo, attempting to get what he wanted out\nof his music. Felix had a chat to him\nbefore the gig and this is what he had to\nsay...\n'My music tends to be kind of my darkest\nmoments, that's where I go to. I spend just\ndays kind of getting things out of me, so I use it to get me through. But I don't know\nwhere it comes from. I'd say it comes from\nexperiences and things that move you,\nthings that do something, they get under\nyour skin, get inside you. You express\nthem, you throw them back out.'\n'Some people have put forward similarities\nbetween myself and artists like Nine Inch\nNails and Tricky. I don't think I sound anything like them, and I think that Trent Reznor\nis a genius. I think people have to give out\nmarkings for people to gauge where it is\nbefore they've heard it. I suppose it can\np ish you off sometimes but it's quite flattering cos I really respect them both.\n'I'm not into pop music at all. Music after\na while as well gets so lethargic and so\nkind of withdrawn... These boring bastards strumming guitars with a little tune\nwith words that are about nothing, and it\njust really pissed me off. It's just like fuck\noff, don't bother. Get a real job.\nOkay then Rico, so you talk the talk well,\nbut can you walk the walk? Thankfully, the\nfollowing show is more than impressive.\nRico's stage presence fits well with the bru-tal, industrial-tinged music, and his first sin-g le, Attack Me, finishes the set in considerable style. One to watch, most definitely.\nGareth\n\n"

    "content": "25 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Arts 21\nmethod\nThe writer of Shopping and Fucking returns. Mark Raven\nHill is a thoughtful writer;\nintelligent but not heavy, controversial but not contrived.\nThe core of the play rests on the balance between hap pi ness and meaning. Let me\nexplain; on one side we have\n\"Trash\", all they do is drink,\ndance and...and not much else - hard core hedonists.\nThey consciously try to\nremove all meaning from\ntheir sexual and otherwise\nrelationships. On the other\nside we have the Socialist, he\nhas always believed in the\ncause and never sold out or compromised in any way, he\nis - therefore - a tramp. He takes everything seriously and finds difficulty having shallow\nfriends and pastimes. Balancing out these extremes lies the\nex-socialist, wannabe Labour\nMR who has sold out in the\neyes of the Socialists. They\nare all unhappy.\nAll sound a bit obvious? Yup.\nBut this play is fast, witty and very funny, and most of all it\nroots itself in a core philosophical question; what is the\nbest balance between just living for the moment or living\nfor your beliefs? Something\nwe would all like to find.\nLucio Fontana was, without doubt, ahead of his time. Before the likes of\nDamian Hirst and Sarah Lucas were a sparkle in their father's eye,\nFontana was pushing the boundaries of what we consider art and leading the Italian avant-garde, whilst later inspiring the likes of Andy Wah ol and Henry Moore. It is ironic that such an influential sculptor is so neglected by the British public - something which this exhibition is trying to\naddress.\nBorn in 1 8 9 9 , Fontana is best known for \"sla shing\" his canvases. The\nexhibition appears to anticipate the public's reluctance to accept this as\nart and confronts these preconceptions by putting his earliest work - traditional sculpture - immediately as you enter. The exhibition then presents\na number of more 'classical' sculptures, beautifully juxtaposed with paradoxical pieces influenced from his work in a commercial pottery factory.\nThis sense of parody is always evident, although Iam hesitant about some of the pieces which seem more inspired by the work of under achieving\nfour year olds rather than \"Neolithic art\", as I was assured!\nHowever, the exhibition then moves upstairs and we are presented with the\n\"Spatial concepts\" (or cut up bits of paper as us phi i is tines would have it).\nSince Fontana has already been proven to be an obviously skilled sculptor it is hard to dismiss his work as mere pretentious shite. Even the most\nhardened cynic finds themselves searching for an underlying philosophy,\nso evident in the previously seen pieces.\nThis is the exhibition's strongest point; we are led gently into confronting\nour preconceptions of art. We are gradually introduced to his more challenging work, leading to a greater appreciation of the historical and philosophical influences in art. It highlights Fontanas' redefinition of sculpture\nin an age of nuclear power, television and space travel and questions the\nimplications for mankind as well as the possibility for artistic development.\nIam still not 1 0 0 % convinced by the whole Stanley knife and canvas thing.\nHowever, one thing is for certain; either Fontana is a genius artist - on the\ncutting edge of art - or he is a genius con-artist, baffling a lot of pseudo-intellectual people into thinking that something which takes 2 minutes to\nproduce is worth \u00a3300, 0 0 0 . Either way, respect is due. Those of you who appreciate and enjoy\nearly 1 7th century art, with all its stiff neck\ncollars and stern expressions, will love this\nexhibition, as Van Dyck is the unrivalled\nking in this field.\nOver100 of Van Dyck's portraits, religious\nand mythological works are on show, ranging from small sketches to massive 3 metre\ntall paintings. The clothing in the portraits\nare what steal the show - the detail, texture,\nfolds and colours of the garments are fantastic. However, don't expect the exhibition\nto cheer you up as black is the most frequently used colour, and smiling was obviously deeply un trendy in Van Dycks era. In\nfact, a fellow visitor commented,\" He( Van\nDyck) has an incredible knack of making\neveryone look constipated!\"\nPersonally, Iam not a major fan of this type\nof art and was inclined to write it off before\nI saw it. However, if you take time to study\neach picture you may well find yourself\ninspired by them - especially as many of the\npictures were drawn by Van Dyck when he\nwas only nineteen.\nI would recommend the exhibition to any of\nyou art fans out there, but for the rest of us\nI would advise getting your cultural kicks at\nthe (free) Serpentine gallery and spending\nthe money you've saved on a few drinks at\nthe Union! Me egan Ben\nID AllyPally\nIf you would like to help with the Arts\npages come along to the Felix office at\n1.00pm on Friday.\n\n"

With Fabric's delayed\nopening the main question\nhas been: can home possibly\nlive up to its much hyped\nbilling as \" The super club for\nthe 2 1 st Century\"? The answer, thankfully, is a resounding yes.\nDespite its Canary Wharf like\nappearance and Leicester\nSquare location, home was not full of tourists mistaking it\nfor Equinox, thanks to a fairly\nstrict door policy. Instead the\ndance floors were rammed with incredibly up for it club-be rs enjoying a great set of hard house from American special guest Danny Tenaglia,\nbefore Oak enfold took over\nthe decks at 1.30 (inducing\nsome serious hero worship\nfrom most of the crowd). His\nset was spot on, with loads of\ngreat tunes, ending with a brilliant version of his own Planet\nPerfecto's 'Bullet In The Gun1. I would highly recommend home sure it's expensive, but\nit's a unique venue with a great line up. Get there early,\nas they're queuing round the\nlength of the Square, and make sure you know a little\nabout dance music for the\ndoormen. I can safely say that\nFabric has a lot to live up to.\nMax Bedrock @ Heaven\nA night to remember..\nThursday mid-October, it's mid afternoon and this lecturer is boring the\npants off me. No t only is his voice more boring than an episode of One Man and His Dog, but for some reason he seems to be walking up and down in front of the board not unlike a pigeon nodding his head backwards\nand forwards. Odd. However, because my mind is elsewhere, all this\ndoesn't bother me. My foot is tapping, my knee is jumping and there's this\nmad banging tune going round and round my head. The reason for this\nis obvious. Tonight at Heaven, one of London's best clubs, sees the Bedrock\nfirst birthday party. Spinning the decks will be Bedrock supremo John Dig weed and pals Sasha and Danny Howells, and I know it's gonna be large...\nFive hours later and I'm there, or at least I'm in the right place - staring at a queue stretching round three sides of block, a heaving queue of like minded c lubbers ready for a massive Thursday. Of course I work for well\nrenowned music mag Felix and security are expecting me. One lax security check and I'm in. Despite the number of people outside it's already\npacked and the dance floor is a sweaty mass of meat - it's heaven, it's gay\nand I love it. After a quick pit stop at the bar (a bottle of Red - to taste it is\nto love it), it's time to check out my Heaven. The chill-out coffee bar is dead no need to revisit here then. Upstairs in two sewer esque vaulted chambers are two strikingly dissimilar atmospheres. One is lit by smoky red\nlamps playing funky music to which boozed up oldies (I'm only young me)\nare going crazy. The other, a decidedly darker, grander room, is packed\nwith punters going crazy in an all together different kind of way.\nBut enough is enough. Downstairs on the main dancefloor is where the\naction will be for the rest of my night in Heaven. Digweed, Sasha and Ho wells on the decks, one lady in a see-through dress and another going crazy\nwith some light sticks - it's a night to remember. Then, suddenly there's Heaven Scent, next it's three o 'clock and finally it's over. I could've stayed till\nsix, but I 'll be back after a month of purgatory back in Heaven, back in\nBedrock. See you there?\nBoycey\nBedrock will be back at Heaven on11 th November.\n..Competition.\nThe Bedrock mix by John Dig weed is out now on INC-r edible records,\nand you can win a copy by answering this simple question.

    "content": "25 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Fiction 27\nwas quite simply the most beautiful woman that he\nhad ever met.\nBizarrely, one of the first things that Sean thought about during their first encounter was what she would look like in forty years time. Her features were so\nstrong that it seemed that old age would only touch them superficially. Nothing about her would ever sag or droop or melt or degenerate. Sean was totally certain that she would look absolutely stunning until the\nday she died. Hers was not a conventional beauty, it was a beauty that resulted from hundreds of small and com plex interactions. Like the fact that all of her teeth were\nperfect except for that one incisor that was too small. Sean had tried on many occasions to quantify exactly\nwhy he found her so attractive but he had never managed to do so satisfactorily. She was tall and athletic\nyet the most striking thing about her was her broad shoulders. They were not thick or brawny shoulders, they were simply unusually wide for a woman. Her arms, like her legs, were not muscular either but\nseemed to disguise a supple strength and li the ness. It\nseemed like there was no fat on her body at all. Her breasts were small but in Sean' s eyes perfectly formed, in all her whole body had a curious touch of masculinity about it, yet in some way this seemed to make her more feminine Her mouth was wide and her nose\nwas very long and straight. Had her nose been on any\nother face, Sean imagined it would have been too long, yet on hers it was perfect. Her eyes were two\nblack wells in her deeply tanned face, which seemed to swallow everything they looked at.\nAs a personality Sean found her totally absorbing too. From the first moment he first met her he felt that\nthey could have discussed any topic in the world without inhibition She had that slightly cynical humour that\nhe loved. She was passionate about music which Sean found very reassuring: he had a fundamental distrust of people who regarded music with disinterest.\nShe could make him genuinely laugh, and he could do the same for her. During the short time that they\nknew each other there was never an awkward moment between them. They walked down to the water's edge, but not the\nsandy beach where Sean and the others usually\nbathed. It was around the corner of the headland\nwhere they would be totally alone. There was no sand\nbut only smooth pebbles, some the size of eggs, others were rocks the size of wheelbarrows. Beyond the\nbeach young birches crowded to the water's edge.\nFor the whole day it had been stormy and raining\nheavily but now the sky was almost clear. Only far\naway to the north were there still dark stacks of cloud\nand the occasional rumble of thunder. The air was\nwarm and but not humid and the wind had vanished\ntotally as if earth and sky were having a period of rest\nand contemplation after the disturbances. Far away\nacross the water, towards the silhouettes of the hills on\nthe mainland, fog was forming and the air and sea appeared to be fusing into one.\nChris rummaged through the basket and produced a bunch of long candles which she lit and\nattached to some of the larger rocks around them.\nSean busied himself with opening a bottle of wine;\nthoughts of how on earth he would acquire another\none for his brother were strangely absent from his\nmind.\nOnce everything was prepared they sat down side\nby side and began to eat, whilst the distant fog began\nto roll towards them, a few lights from the opposite\nshore occasionally breaking through.\nIn his semiconscious state Sean was aware that\nthe straps that held him to the life-vest had been co ming undone gradually over the past few hours. But\nthere was nothing he could do; he was too weak.\nAt ten o 'clock they finished eating. They both left\nthe comfort of the dying candlelight and hunted for\nfirewood along the water. It was always bark/ess and flat pieces of wood they found, bleached by the sun\nand smoothed by the water and always bone dry.\nOnce the flames had taken hold they sat down again\n- closer this time - and Sean opened the second bottle of wine.\nEarlier Chris had become strangely silent when\nsomething came up in their conversation. Sean\nexplained that in two month's time he was going to\nMadrid to see a friend, and he lightly suggested that\nshe might want to come along. His imagination was\nbecoming lubricated by the wine and already he could\nnot envisage the shadow of another parting between\nthem. But she did not answer, and when the silence\nbetween them grew and grew he had to look across at\nher. She stared into the distance and somehow it\nseemed that her eyes were much larger and darker\nthan usual. Eventually she spoke.\n\"Please take each day that we share as it\ncomes...\" she whispered. Sean opened his mouth and\nwas about to retort but she pre-emp ted him. \"Please,\"\nshe repeated, even quieter this time. Sean a gon is ed for several minutes in silence and then decided to pursue it no further. The moment passed and gradually\ntheir quiet murmuring and occasional laughter by the\nfire resumed.\nThe fog had long since disappeared and they\nwatched as the sun sank into the black hills across the\npale water. Above them a thin ribbon of cloud that\nstretched from north to south was dyed blood red as\nthe day finally ended.\nHalf an hour later, the second bottle of wine was\nalso drained and suddenly Chris leapt to her feet.\n\"Do you know what we're going to do now?\" She\nsaid. Her eyes were bright with the alcohol.\n\"Urn...no, but I dare say you're going tell me.\"\n\"We're going to swim.\"\nCaspar von Wrede\n\n"

One recent session began with\nthe lecturer trying for two or three minutes to get students to shut up and pay attention so he could start. Technicians, who have become used to dealing with rowdy wannabe doctors, spotted\nthe problem and put out aloud high pitched\nbeep over the speakers in the Lecture Theatre.\nThe beep persisted, drowning out conversations,\nuntil everyone had calmed down, and the lecture\ncould begin. Kevin could not help seeing the situation as analogous to a schoolteacher blowing a whistle in a playground at the end of a lunchtime.\nTIME MANAGEMENT\nA lecturer in the Biology department is currently\nexperimenting on himself. Dr Russell Foster is\nconducting research which could have military\napplications. He has succeeded in altering his\nbody clock by the ingenious use of a specially\nadapted pair of sun glasses. The glasses are apparent iy capable of artificially simulating the effect of daylight. The lecturer claims to be living\na36 hour day, while being currently involved\nwith undergraduate teaching. Kevin hopes he\nhas managed to organise his teaching commitments around his wacky day, and that students\nare not expected to attend lectures at strange\ntimes of the night.\nWHY DON'T YOU...\nRecently Kevin found himself sitting underneath a huge dinosaur in the Naturai History Museum listening to Patrick Moore speak about the pos-MishMash A Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nsibi li ties of finding alien life. Kevin has also seen\na video of a human hatching, courtesy of ICSM's Professor Lord Winston, and learned of efforts to\nstop the leaning tower of Pisa toppling. There is\nalways a plethora of interesting events going on in and around IC. Yet even the most clued up\nstudent can find it difficult to find out what is on offer. Before the summer, a week after the front\ncover of NewScientist proclaimed:\" Cyber heart beats throbs and will change the face of medicine\" the man responsible, Professor Dennis\nNobel, visited IC. Kevin attended his brilliant and accessible presentation. It was disappointing that\nalthough it drew many academics out of the\nbowels of the BMS, Kevin did not see any undergraduates present. Kevin suggests all students\nshould make the most of the fact they are living\nin London, and become aware of what is going on around them. MILLENNIUM BITES\nImprovements in the library are not just cosmetic\n- behind the flat screens significant changes are taking place. The library catalogue system is\nbeing upgraded. The present telnet system is to\nbe replaced by a web based service. This means\nthe simple telnet terminals wii l have to be replaced with powerful PCs. Kevin was not surprised to learn that the improvements are not\nbeing made just to improve the service provided\nto students - Kevin has learnt that it is imperative\nthe library's new system is up and running before\nChristmas. The consequences for missing this\ndeadline could be serious, as apparently the present system has been bitten by the millennium bug.

    "content": "25 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Films 25\nBowfinger\nA comedy film starring Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy in the late\nnineties does not bode well. Both have seen their golden touches, after such films as Dirty Rotten\nScoundrels and Beverly Hills Cop, not so much desert them as convince the average blok eon the street that they had packed in acting and were now sunning themselves on some faraway desert island. The last film Steve Martin co wrote was Sergeant Bilk o. What a good film\nthat was. I say that on the evidence that recently Martin confessed it\nwas a comedy film that he himself didn't find funny. This coming from the man who co wrote and starred in it. And what of Murphy? He seems to have fallen prey to the Hollywood sacrilege of relying on his\nfilms special effects to mask an awful script - if it wasn't being horrendously overweight it was talking to a variety of animals, all in a rather\nunfunny way. As I mentioned, the film, looking on the past form of the actors, and writer (Martin), looks like good cannon fodder for people with magazine space. I will therefore not totally disappoint. The film centres on Bobby Bow finger( Martin), a struggling movie producer director. Almost bankrupt, he hatches an ingenious way of making a film starring the world's biggest star Kit Ramsey( Murphy). This is achieved by filming the star doing his everyday business and actors walking up to him and pretending that he is in a film scene with them. This simple concept is\nthe basis of the film. As one can imagine, the comic possibilities for such scenes are almost limitless and Martin take s full advantage of these opportunities. Martin even expands on this idea by allowing Murphy to do another of his\" one film two role\" efforts, so he also plays the stereotypical dumb twin brother. You know, the one has been forgotten by the more successful sibling and in serious films tries to stir\nup a bit of pathos. This pathos creeps unfortunately into this film momentarily in away that makes your toes curl rather than pull on the\nheartstrings. There is a good reason for this as well. The vast majority\nof the characters in the film are not nice people. Martin plays a character who is way below a bum; Heather Graham' s character is a whore. They get all the equipment for making the film\nby stealing it from a film studio. You don't feel happy about what they\nare doing and you certainly wouldn't want anything to do with them. \"Lighten up!\" I hear you cry \"It's a comedy!\" Maybe, but the non comedy bits of this film ie the bits where they are not chasing Murphy about, make this film decidedly two faced. The Blair Witch Project\nThere are posters on the tube, on the street, even in the union for The Blair Witch Project. In fact there are posters anywhere that you can put the mandI bet you're thinking,\" What the hell is it?!\" Hailed as the\nscariest film ever, The Blair Witch Project is one film everyone should see. Do not let the fact that it is terrifying put you off going to see it.\nThere is no blood or gore and everything you see appears to be so believable. Before you even decide togo and see it you should check out the mythology behind or it won't make much sense. So goto www. blair witch. com and read all about it. To sum it up there is a story\nabout a woman who was accused of witchcraft in 1 7 8 5 . She was banished from her village, Blair, and then all her accusers and half the children of the village disappear. The townspeople think it's a curse\nand flee the town. Thirty-nine years later Burkittsville is founded on the\nsite of Blair and weird things happen. All the usual stuff, people go missing strange and spooky sightings you get the idea. In October1994 three young people decide to do a documentary on the Blair Witch and go out into the woods armed with a handheld videocamera and a CP-1 6 film camera never to be seen again. The tapes were discovered a year later and this film is the footage as it\nhappened. Shot in real-time the film is supposed to cover eight days and that'show long it took to shoot. Costing under$100,000 to make it has already grossed$140 million in USA so you can imagine how good it is. The dialogue was improvised by the actors with only guidance from the directors and there was no opportunity to redo scenes. In\naddition, all the filming was done by the actors so make sure you sit\ntowards the back of the cinema when you go and see it otherwise you'll get travel sickness. Another piece of advice trying to tell your self \"It's just a film\" doesn't work, so don't even bother doing it.\nThe Blair Witch opens in fourteen cinemas across the WestEnd on22 October including the Odeon High Street Kensington but I definitely\nrecommend you go and see this on Halloween.

This week's column is brought to you by the letters U,Lan dU and the number50. Here goes with the latest from our University counterparts.\nLondon Transport\nICU is now the only place in London where students can buy LT discount\ncards over the counter. King's( who\nwere issuing them from their registry\nand not their Union) have now stopped. Other UL U colleges are reporting an absolute minimum wait\nof 4 weeks for postal orders. So a big thank you goes out to the ICU office staff who have worked flat out\nto issue over 3 0 0 0 cards. The Union has 'lost' \u00a3 5 0 0 in extra staffing and more than \u00a350 in postage, but then\nyou lot are saving tons.\nVoting\nVoter registration slips are available\nfrom me on email( president@ic.ac.uk) and on postcards from the office ( ICS MSU have\na bunch too). Coming soon to ICU who's standing for what and the promises they are making. The ele c Attack Alarms / Condoms\nAerosol attack alarms are available\nfree of charge (on production of a valid ICU card) from the Union Office Reception in South Ken sing ton. The other campuses should be getting supplies soon. Condoms are\navailable free of charge from IC\nHealth Centre( Southside, South Kensington). Dispensing machines\ncan be found in Halls, Union toilets\nor they can be purchased from Southside Shop or ICU Newsagent on the Walkway. There are plenty of\nlocal chemists around the main cam pus sites. With a recent survey c lai ming 1 in 5 students are regularly having unprotected sex, it is important\nthat you all stay safe. The Union also\nhas a limited supply.\nAccommodation\nTerm having started and routines settled into, this is about the time that\nthe Union notices that things are going wrong with accommodation( either private sector or College). It is\nimportant to know that things can be done and that Martin Thomson t ions are next year. A lot of you will\nautomatically be registered for where you are living this year....BUT\nNOT IN TIME FOR THESE ELECTIONS, because the local councils\nare very slow with these things. If you\nwant to vote, fill in a card. London weighting\nLoans, grants, whatever you get, are\nhigher for those studying in London than outside. BUT it's not enough. \u00a335 per week would rent a large\nhouse with living room in Nottingham, even more in the North. Lond on weighting does not allow Lond on students to afford equivalent\ndigs - we think we've done OK if we only have 3 5 cockroaches for \u00a3 8 0\nper week! The Presidents of the UL U colleges have been ranting about this for ages. The big change is that\nthere is now a permanent member of staff from UL U who can research\nthe exact stats on how hard-up London students are, which gets us a lot\nfurther when we are lobbying people\netc. So, in the interest of the com( Union Adviser), Kate Gummo w( iCU\nAccommodation Officer) and myself\ncan advise on a whole range of\nissues, including your rights as tenants and help with any problems you\nmay be having with your landlord.\nCommon problems could include\nrepairs not being done when asked,\nharassment by landlords, disputes\nwith co-tenants, problems with the\nway rent is paid etc. These points\nneed to be stated now as problems\nhappen throughout the year. iCU produces a detailed Housing Rights\nGuide which is very helpful and can\nbe obtained from the Union Reception in South Kensington. Some of\nthe serious problems often arise from\nsimple ones left to fester. Advice is\njust the other end of the line, so call\nand ask, however silly you may think\nit sounds.\nIC Health Centre Registration\nIf you have moved recently (including\nout of Halls and into private sector\naccommodation) you need to inform\nmon good we will begin a structured\nprogramme of kidnapping and assassination of all the rich kids so they don't skew the stats!!\nIQ of 50\nHas anyone, seen copies of London Student lying around the place? They are supposed to come to Beit\nbut for two weeks they have not\nappeared yet! The oh so bright\ndelivery man would appear to have\nmissed the Albert Hall landmark. In\nthe meantime mopping up vomit\noutside the main stairway loos will\nhave to be done with paper towels.\n(Sorry, Mr Campbell, it's not that\nbad really!)\nClinic at Council\nThe UL U President Matt Butt will be at the next Council on November the 9th(6.30 p mUD H). He will be answering questions of al! natures\nrelating to ICU in UL U,UL U and the\nNUS, this years campaigns and the\ninfamous UL U strategic plan (plus\nanything else you want to know).\nImperial College Health Centre of\nyour change of address if you are\nregistered there. If you have moved out of the registration are a(Nl,5,6,7, NW1,3,5,8,S W1,3,5,6,7,10,W1,2,8,9,10,11,14, W1 2\n(College Hall ONLY), WC1 and WC2) then you need to register with\na doctor in your area. Correct registration covers your 2 4 hour care.\nHowever any student can still use the\nHealth Centre during the day (as well\nas students at the Royal College of\nMusic), whether registered at ICH C or not.\nStudent Support Scheme\nAgain I would like to remind first\nyears who have not contacted the\nStudent Loans Company for whatever reason that if they do not apply for\na loan then they WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE for any future help, should\nthey try and apply in their second or third year. The trick is to apply, fill out\nall the forms and then request zero\npounds when the last form arrives.\nCouncil will, as always, be open to\nail, so come along and quiz!\n- This Week's Union Meetings\u2022 Monday25 th:15.30 Trading\n(Union bars and catering) C CR \u2022 Tuesday 2 6 th:13.00 Services\n(minibuses and the office) C CR \u2022 1 3 . 0 0 A& E Treasurers' meeting\nRC \u2022 1 8 . 0 0 iCU Welfare\n\u2022 CA G soup run for the homeless\n(contact nada.you s if@ ic.ac.uk)\n\u2022 Wednesday27 th: COMMEMORATION DAY \u2022 Thursday 2 8 th:12.30R CC Treasurers' meeting( come get your\ncheques!)

There are funds available though-out\nthe year, all you need to do is apply.\nThe first round request for Access\nFund applications will happen short-ly. If you are aUK undergraduate student then you can apply. Forms will\nbe available in the next few weeks\nfrom Union Reception or Tony Cullen( Student Finance,335 Sherfield\nBuilding). There is an IC Hardship\nFund available to all IC students and C CU hardship funds available( except ICS MSU) to students within\nthose CC Us. Advice on how to make applications to all of these funds is\navailable from Martin Thomson( Union Adviser) or myself.\nUnion Roadshows\nAs part of the plan to roll out the\nUnion to where you are the first\nRoadshow will take place at Charing Cross (Reynolds Building) on3 rd November between 12 and2 pm. We will be there to help with Union\ncards and UL U cards.\nWelfare Update\nBy Kevin Butcher, Deputy President (Education & Welfare)\n\n"
