    "content": "The RCS go walk ies... Ten Tors '91\nEvery year the RCS Union enters one or\ntwo teams for the Ten Tors competition.\nThis is a55 mile hike over Dartmoor.\nThe object of this is for teams of six to\nwalk from checkpoint to checkpoint,\nwhich are situated at the summits of the\nTors, passing through ten over two days.\nThe event has been running for about 30\nyears, and is open to young people from\nboth military and civilian organisations.\nToo easy? Please read on...\nThis year's 'Ten Tors' takes place on\n18/19 May, and we hope to enter two\nteams. Those selected will be driven\ndown to Okehampton on Friday 17 May,\nwhere we will stay at the army base. The\nwalk begins at 7am on Saturday morning.\nEach team will then walk for 10 to 12\nhours, stopping only for food and 'blister\ncontrol'. We hope to cover about 30 miles\n(six tors) before the checkpoints close at\nnightfall, then, breaking camp early on\nSunday morning, cover the remaining\nfour tors (25 miles) by 5pm. Matt Jarman's account of the expedition\nlast year gives a further insight to this\nchallenge:\n'... having made the long drive down to\nOkehampton on Friday afternoon, we\nstood in line for the various kit checks\nnecessary for the team to be passed\n'ready' for the following two days. This\nwas followed by a short film on 'Safety\non Dartmoor'.\nWith all our checks completed, an\n'interesting' meal was cooked and eaten,\nand, as darkness fell, we settled down to\nsleep. It seemed only moments later\nwhen we were rudely woken by the\nsounds of 'Chariots of Fire' blasting over\nthe t annoy. This was followed by a medley of songs including 'The long walk\nhome', 'Here comes the rain again' and\n'Keep on running'. We completed our last\nminute kit check and made our way to\nthe start.\nHaving been addressed by the visiting\ndignitaries, we chatted to some of the\nother teams at the massed start (about\n2000 young people), and then we started\nour 'Ten Tors'. It was a distinct\ndisadvantage that we had never been to\nDartmoor before: it is a lot less rugged on\nthe 'Guildford Downs' where we had been\ntraining. However, we walked on\nregardless both of the pain in our feet\na Manned Tor\nand, sometimes, the direction in which\nwe were heading.\nAlthough our expedition was to cover\n55 miles, there are 45 mile and 35 mile\nhikes too. This makes for some confusing\npath crossing, as everyone seems to head\nin random directions.\nWe walked on, arriving at the sixth tor\nat around five pm. We continued until it\ngot dark, whereupon we stopped for the\nnight in the quiet of the moor.\nThe following morning saw the team\ntired and footsore, slogging on from tor\nto tor, desperately trying to stay in touch\nwith the finish time of 5pm. At each tor\nwe were urged to keep going, as our card\nwas checked, and the time marked down.\nIf you do not reach a tor by a certain\ntime, the team is 'crashed out', retired for\nits own sake.\nFinishing was a sight for sore feet, as\nby now only sheer determination kept us\ngoing. Pete sympathetically loaded us into\nthe minibus, and the long drive back to\nLondon gave us time to tend our many\nblisters and aching legs. Although we\ncould not walk very well for the next\nweek, all the team agreed that our effort\nhad been well worth it.'\nThis challenge is not for the weak-hearted. It is a severe test of stamina,\nendurance, enormous care in planning,\nhard training, skilful navigation and,\nabove all, fitness and team work. We hope to begin training soon, starting with\nfitness and stamina, leading on to\nwalking, navigation and team-work skills.\nThe fitness training should not be too\ntime-consuming, taking about two hours a week. We hope to get out onto wilder\nterrain later.\nThere will be a meeting for all those\ninterested on Monday 11 February, at\n12.30pm in Southside. Priority will be\ngiven to RCS students, but there will be\nplaces for G&G and RSM members. If you are interested please contact:\nMatt Jarman Materials II\nor\nPeter Galley Ten Tors Manager RCSU.\nFinally, if the Ten Tors sounds too\ndemanding, or if you think last year's team were a bunch of nanci es and YOU could run round the course, do not be\nput off, it is well worth it, even though it\nmay hurt a little!\n11\n\n"

    "content": "Computer Company Crashes\nAn authorised Apple Mac dealer, CSS,\ncalled in the receivers last Friday, leaving\namong its creditors some Imperial\nstudents with no means of legal redress.\nSuch students had paid cash up front to\nthe Apple Centre, Knightsbridge, a CSS\noutlet, and have not received the\nhardware ordered.\nThe receivers, Levey Gee and Partners,\nare lia sing with Apple regional sales.\nHowever Apple UK states that it has no\nlegal responsibility but that it is\nmonitoring the situation carefully.\nSo will the Imperial Students get either\ntheir money back or the hardware they\nordered? The first priority of receivers is\nto pay the wages of the staff of the\ncompany involved. Funds are usually\nraised by an asset sale, including stock.\nTheir next priority is to pay outstanding\ndebts, eg rates, then creditors, then\nshareholders. Creditors, in this case\nstudents at Imperial, may receive as little\nas 2 5 % of their money if the receivership\nfollows its normal course.\nApple UK has not been specific about\nthe role it might play if creditors were\nnot fully recompensed. Apple UK has\nmade it clear that it acknowledges the\ndistress caused to prospective Apple Mac\ncustomers by the CSS receivership. Apple\nUK sees today's student customer as\ntomorrow's corporate buyer.\nStudents are strongly advised not to\npay by cash or cheque for any large item\nin advance. If you do have to pay up\nfront then use a credit card. If the\ncompany in question goes bust, the credit\ncard company will refund the lost money.\nWhy did the students pay up front? The\nanswer is simple. According to one\nstudent, the staff at the Knightsbridge\nApple Centre refused to order hardware\nunless it was paid for fully in advance.\nAccording to another authorised Apple\ndealer this is not normal practice. Five to\nten percent of the total cost may be\nasked of the customer as a sign of good\nfaith, and the hardware must be fully\npaid for on delivery.\nSERC Cuts Funding\nThe Science and Engineering Research\nCouncil (SERC) have been forced to cut\nback on research spending, it was\nanounced on Wednesday. Of concern are\nplans to close the Nuclear Structure\nFacility (NSF) at the Daresbury\nLaboratory, to reduce the neutron\nIC Student Invents The SNOWBOX (World Patents Pending)\nfacilities at the Rutherford Appleton\nLaboratory and to pull out of the\nEuropean Laser facility.\nOther reductions in funding include\n'sharp cutbacks' in information\ntechnology, the pulling out of research\ninto gravity waves and less spending on\nengineering design.\nThe rector, Sir Eric Ash, said that the\nshortfall of \u00a340 m in SERC's budget would\nhave 'some effect' on the research\ndepartments at Imperial. He went on to\nsay that the College is 'one of the biggest\ncustomers' of SERC, but added that he did\nnot expect the effect to be drastic.\nExpert List\nThe College Press Officer, Karen Peploe,\nis compiling a list of 'experts' at Imperial.\nThis will contain the names of those\nacca demi c staff who are willing to be\ninterviewed by the media on their\nspecialist areas.\nOther institutions have made such lists\navailable to the media, including the\nLondon Schooi of Economics (LSE). This\nexplains the preponderance of LSE staff\ninterviewed on television and radio.\nKaren as kes that any member of staff\nwho has not returned the questionnaire\ndo so immediately, as the list is due to be\npublished mid-February. Any member of\nstaff who has not received a questionnaire should contact the Press\nand Public Relations Office on internal\n8628 as soon as possible.\nSo why were CSS following a cash in\nadvance policy? CSS had a serious cash\nflow problem. The company has long\nbeen undercutting its competitors in the\nApple Mac market. In times of recession\nprofit margins narrow and companies\nsuch as CSS feel the squeeze.\nSince other Apple Mac dealers have\nstated that they were aware of CSS's possible financial problems, it can be\nsurmised that Apple UK was not totally in\nthe dark. Indeed, one of CSS's creditors\nis, of course, Apple UK. The receivers are compiling a list of all\ncreditors and monies owed and this list\nwill be passed to Apple UK. If you\nordered hardware through CSS, parted\nwith money and have not yet received\nyour equipment, contact Anthony Lester,\nChem Eng III. Mr Lester is compiling a list that will be passed to the CSS's official\nreceivers. Students in difficulty should\nalso apply to the Access fund (room 344\nSherfield) today.\nSilwood Disco\nDrunk 'n'j iv in' is the name of the game\nnext Friday when the Silwood Park\nValentines Evening makes its annual\nappearance. Relax in the splendour of the\nconservatory or recline in the historic\nlounge as the band play their up-tempo\nbrand of jazz. Elegantly sweep across the\ndancefloor as you and your partner glide\nin perfect unison, the picture of bliss.\nAlternatively, drink ten cocktails from\nWac's Bar, take off your jacket and jump-jive like a lunatic as that last Daquiri\ntakes effect.\nEither way, this promises to be a great\nparty night, in the most picturesque part\nof College. Get your tickets from the\nUnion Office; only \u00a33 in advance. Coach\nprovided at 6.30pm from outside the\nUnion, return to London around midnight.\nResignations\nThe newly vacated post of Felix Music\nEditor has been filled by John Furlong.\nThe ex-Music Editor, Sarah Harland, said\nthat the combined pressures of college\nwork and the constant chasing up of\nreviews during the week figured in her\ndecision to resign. Better luck to John!\nThis week we also say goodbye to\nToby Jones, stressed ex-News Editor,\nwho's resignation letter contained the\nfollowing sentiments: 'Too tired, too\nstressed, too far behind on coursework,\nNOT fed up with doing news.' The post\nhas been temporarily filled by Anna Teeman.\n\n"

This music is however subtle ly different. Heavily stylised metal riffs are\nlayered over a bassline which controls\nboth pace and melody.

In his first knockout\nfight he strangled his opponent but was\nunfortunate to go out in his next fight\ndue to some dubious refereeing.\nThe whole squad's sympathies go to\nblue belt Reg Cook, a hot medal prospect\nin the under 60kg category.

There are\nIthree things you need to know\nabout this film : 1) It offers an\nunrivalled chance to hear the late (great)\nJim Henson at his best with a superb\nrendition of the seminal classic 'Rubber\nDuckie'. 2) The butler is mad. 3) Tom Selleck is a nicer example of humanity\nthan the entire A A put together (for our\nolder readers, see Felicity Kendall re:\nLittle Mermaid) The cast includes three\nmen and a little lady, and a big lady. And another blok e. As well as a vicar\n(ph wo arr!),a headmistress and an\nincomprehensible (and possibly\nincontinent) shepherd.\nSo basically, the story goes : the little\nlady has grown up from a baby (in a rather s uprising ly short time, ie about five\nminutes of 'endearing' snapshots) but she\nstill has three daddies (none of whom are\nengaged below the waist) but just the one\nmu/ om my who is about to be. But (and\nthis is a big but) not to any of the\naforementioned three men but to an\nIntruder (even though she secretly loves\nMagnum, PI. Even better, he loves her\ntoo) and naturally none of them are\nhappy about this, especially since it\nmeans a bod age in Good Old Blighty (if\nthere isn't such a word as a bod age there\nshould be). It turns out that Intruder is\nNot A Very Nice Person; he viv i sects live\nsheep, spits in elevators and EVEN WORSE he's NOT VERY GOOD WITH CHILDREN. Now Magnum, as well as his\npals The Guy From Police Academy and\nSam from Cheers, can tell this at some\ntil\nsix thousand miles distance and set off to\nright matters, naturally involving much hi jinks and apoplexy. Excuse us, there's a good bit on the telly.\nFor our more devoted fans (and we\nknow there are many, many of you)\nthere is nary a poodle in sight. Magnum\nsomehow resists solving the mystery by\ngrinning charismatic ally and getting the\ncrap beaten out of him and settles for a desperate if abortive s nog se sh with\nheadmistress. Suffice it to say that once\nmore everything comes out happy\nbunnies in the end and rounds off a very\nnice movie very nicely indeed. On the\nminus side: The big lady has a nine mile\nwide grin and refuses to stop using it and\nMinis get more bad coverage in this film\nthan in the entire back catalogue of\nJacques Cousteau.\nThis film is better than it has any right\nto be, as well as including a few willy\ngags. Nice acting and superior direction\nmake for an elegantly observed drama of\nsocial mores with tension drawn in every\nline (s pes h the bit where Sam the barman\nenters in Drac bloodsucker costume). We liked it better than Look Who's Talking\n(and we liked that better than\nparthenogenetic sex). But is it great ?\nAlan Freeman says 'Not arf, pop-pickers !'\nThe Amazing (And Original) Flying\nGerbil Machine\nDances With Wolves\nI The film opens in the midst of the\nCivil War in Tennessee. As a reward for an act of bravery Lt.\nJohn Dunbar (Kevin Field of Dreams\nCostner) chooses reassignment to the\nWestern Frontier\u2014wanting to see the\nfrontier before it disappears. On arrival\nhe finds that the post has been deserted\nbut he elects to stay there and wait for\nreplacements to arrive.\nHe soon comes into contact with the\nSioux Indians and tries to communicate\nwith them. With the help of Stands with a Fist (a white woman adopted into the\ntribe as a child) as an interpreter,progress\nis made,albeit slow at first. As Dunbar\ngets to know the Sioux he learns their\nlanguage and their customs. He wins the\ntrust of the tribe and, having fallen in\nlove with Stands with a Fist, marries into\nit. By this time he has a Sioux name Dances with Wolves\u2014and he does not\nwant to see the Sioux way of life\ndisappear, although he knows it is\ninevitable.\nAlthough a very ambitious project for\nCostner's directorial debut, it seems to\nwork well. The screenplay was written by\nMichael Blake (an old friend of Costner's), based on his novel of the same name.\nThe min u tae of Sioux life were\nres era ched painstakingly for this film:their\ndress, customs and even the language\n,Lakota, which is spoken in the relevant\nscenes in the film and subtitled in English.\nAll the Red Indian characters in the film\nare played by Native Americans.\nHowever, in all this laudable attention\nto detail there are a couple of anomalous\npoints: Why is Stands with a Fist the only\nwoman in the tribe not to wear her hair\nin plaits? Also, although she only\nappeared to be about five years old when\nadopted into the tribe, she can recall\nwords such as 'holy' and 'honour' but not\nwords like 'stand' or 'bird', yet she can\ntell Dunbar if he's guessed the word\ncorrectly after she writes it.\nOverall though, the film is a realistic\nand detailed portrayal of Sioux life in the\nlast century. It is a very moving film,\nwith plenty of action, humour and, of\ncourse, the obligatory love interest. Well\nworth a visit and, at just under three\nhours long, good value for money.\nJLW.\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial\nI'm sure you've all heard the analogy\nwhere you imagine life as a big roller\ncoaster, with you strapped in the front\ncar. Roller-coasters, by their nature, tend\nto go up and, er, down quite a bit, thus\nrepresenting life's successes and, er, little\n(?) problems. All fairly simple stuff. What\nthe analogy doesn't tend to cover is what\nhappens when the tracks finish in\nmid-air...\nDisaster. Depression. And Exams.\nIt's been one of those weeks...First two of\nthe section editors resign due to the\npressure of their courses. I 've got exams,\nso I haven't been able to do as much as I should to make up for this loss, and, as\nany astute readers may have realised,\nFelix is not as big as it usually is. There\nare several reasons for this, but the main\none is our printing press. It's broken.\nBadly. Or it was, but due to the super-heroic efforts of Andy and Chris, it is no\nlonger. Unfortunately, it was broken for\nlong enough to totally throw our printing\nschedule into an orbit of Ursa Minor, thus\ncausing the smaller edition you now hold.\nAll these factors, combined with some\npersonal ones (from which I will spare\nyou, as I'm such a generous guy) have\ncombined to give me the feeling that the\ntrack has definitely stopped (but the car\nI'm in didn't). To top it all off, the latest\nissue of Legends of the Dark Knight (a Batman comic which has been uniformly\nexcellent for months) is crap.\nSo, time for some medal awarding. As\nnoted above, I haven't done much for\nFelix this week. Thus all the remaining\nstaff deserve a massive round of\ngratuitous back-slapping, for being\nincredibly stupid and doing loads more\nwork than they should have to do.

Quite a bit.\nThese are not unrelated to the above...\nExams: At some point in my life someone\nwill explain to me just why sitting in a large, intimidating hall, surrounded by\nnervous people and trying to remember\nfacts and theories that you're supposed to\nhave memorised (even though, in a job\ninvolving them, you'd be able to look\nthem up) gives College and thus potential\nemployers a good indication of your\nacademic abilities. At least they could let\nyou take in your notes and/or textbooks.\nAfter all, the ability to find the relevant\npiece of information from such sources is\njust as important to you in real life than\nthe ability to remember it, if not more so\n(you can always look it up again, in real\nlife). Yes, I'm aware that the usual reply\nto this is that exams provide an abstract\nscale to measure people against, etc, etc,\nbut why not provide a more realistic\nscale?\nStaff: Two of the best staff Felix has\nhave had to give up their posts, because\nof college work. This is basically because\nthey'd been having to do so much for\nFelix. This in turn is because not enough\npeople come in to help us! In the last few\nweeks there have been some hiccups\nwith the distribution on Friday morning\n(my fault). People have come in or rung\nup to find out what happened.

    "content": "The Grifters\nIThe opening shots of The Grifters is\nrather reminiscent of Woody Allen's Manhattan\u2014 black and white shots\nof a city, complemented by a 'big' score.\nHowever this is not New York but Los\nAngeles, and the director does not have\nthe same love affair with the metropolis\nas Woody Allen\u2014not surprising since he\nis the British director Stephen Frears\n(with My Beautiful Laundrette and\nDangerous Liaisons to his credit). Instead\nwhat Frears has produced is a marvellous\nthriller with rather risque sexual\nundertones.\nThe story revolves around Roy Dillon,\nhis girlfriend, Myra, and his mother, Lily,\nplayed excellently by John Cusack,\nAnnette Bening and Anjelica Houston\nrespectively. Roy has spent his adult life\n'gritting', agr if ter being the same as a con-artists. He is st ric lya small-change\nman, a buck here, a buck there\u2014no one's going to worry about a couple of dollars,\nso life goes on for Roy. That is, until his\nmother appears after eight years without\nany contact whatsoever. Lily works the\nnumbers for the mob, placing bets to\nshorten the odds at racetracks. However,\nLily commits a crime from which Bobo\nJustus (sic), her boss, will make her pay\ndearly.\nMyra, meanwhile, is the sexually\ncharged girlfriend whom Roy finds\nimpossible to trust. She will, in fact, do\nexactly what she feels she can get away\nwith\u2014normally involving the charms of\nher body. Myra and Lily hate each\nother\u2014Myra tells Roy that she mistrusts\nhis mother. Lily, on the other hand,\ndeclares Myra a slut. And Roy...what's he\nsupposed to make of all this? Well, poor\nRoy doesn't know who he wants to fuck\nmore\u2014his girlfriend or his 'ma'.\nEverything comes together in this\nfilm\u2014the script is sharp, the acting good,\nand the direction slick. Oh yeah, there\nisn't, strictly speaking, a plot, but you\nprobably won't notice.\nI.H. Metropolitan Flying Ashes IY ou know those old black and\nwhite films that they show on\nBBC2. The ones with the\nmarvellous acting, the simple but\nintriguing plot lines and the complete and\nutter lack of extraneous action. Do you\nlike them?\nIf so then you will probably appreciate\nthe subtle humour of Metropolitan. Set on\nthe island of Manhattan, the film concerns\nthe lives of some 'preppies' (UHP's) over\nthe Christmas season of prom balls and\nafter prom parties.\nHowever, amongst the party of UHP's is\nan outsider. A man from a lower class\nbackground than the others. Metropolitan\ndeals with his integration with the prom\nset while trying to stay true to his\nconscience.\nSo, who's in it? Certainly nobody that\nI 've ever heard of. This seems to be a good thing; no-one is trying to upstage\nanybody else and the actors work truly\nas a team. This film is most definitely a 'Classic'. Go see it.\nStef.\nIA question: is mere performance\nenough to sustain a piece of\ntheatre? Exchange Productions'\nperformers certainly know their stuff, and\nthe performance was on the edge of\nmodern theatrical technique, with the\nright amount of emotional intensity for\nthe subject matter. The play is largely\nderived from letters written by political\nprisoners in the USSR, and is performed\nin a bitty, syl is ed manner, that will\nprobably not be to the taste of all, but\nthen, what is?\nIt principally revolves around three\narche typical characters, Tanya, Lazerina\nand Irina, relocated for indeterminate\nreasons and hailing from wildly differing\nbackgrounds. They interact with each\nother, and with a cipher of a male, who\nrepresents rapist, husband and lover at\nonce. Relations between the sexes seem\nrestricted to a purely sexual level,\nwhereas those between women are\nallowed more room, although they do\nstray into the territory of the homo-erotic\nat times.\nThat's your lot, really. The point the\nplay seems to be making is either\nimpenetrably obscure, or depressingly\nsimplistic. To wit: it isn't any fun being a political prisoner. If this is all the play is\nsaying, we have a chronic waste of\ntalent, thrown away on an inadequate\nplay. On the other hand, maybe i'm just\ntoo dense too see the point. Interesting...\nFlying Ashes is showing at The ICA, the\nMall. Concessionary tickets cost S5.00,\nwith day membership costing SI.\nAlternatively, student membership can be\nbought for a year at \u00a39. The Box Office is\non 071 930 3647.\nPendragon\n\n"

Dear Andy,\nHmm, interesting...Sorry, just imagining\nthe next Felix compared to this one I'm looking at now(891). I mean, the\neditorial; it seems to be saying that you' a in t too pleased with these Christian\ntypes shooting off at the mouth with\nopinions and things what they believe in\nand you don't. Funny old thing, but looks\nto me like most of the letters page is\npeople letting fire with their own opinions, saying who's right and who's wrong. I mean, take that Athena thing\n(can't say blok e or some such on account\nof it being too scared to give its name):\nmust be into thousands of words of\nopinion by now. If I was editor I'd be\ngetting a bit tired of it. But you don't pick\non it, you pick on a couple of Christians\ninstead.\nSeriously though, I don't see any\nconsistency in your complaints. After all,\na good portion of Felix is opinion\n(thankfully: pure facts are so boring!) so\nyou can't really pick on one, even if you don't like it and/or the way it's presented. Yet you rip into Carrie\nexplaining her views on abortion with\ngreat vim and vigour (at least she gave\nyou an argument, rather than an opinion\nlike\u2014for instance\u2014all veggies are a 'miserable ill shower' (quoting Alan Bailey). She also made it clear it was her\nown personal belief. Nor were you over-tolerant of David's letter ('if you can't answer his/her questions', you said, in\nyour rant) when one with similar failings\nby Mr Pendragon in the previous issue\nwent without comment.\nIn short you have two options: accept\nthat anyone can say what they like in\nopinion areas of Felix, or ban anyone\nfrom having opinions at all. The former\nwould mean you'd have to stop picking\non Christians (and others), the latter\nwould probably get you on good terms\nwith His Rectorness...\nFinally, I know Christians have a long\nhistory of persecution (it's actually good\nfor you: 'Blessed are you when you suffer\ninsults and persecution for my sake'\n(Matthew 5:11) but I'd rather get my blessings in away that meant you weren't storing up trouble for yourself). If\nyou want to continue it that's your\nbusiness.\nYours awkwardly,\nAndy Cooksley, Physics 3.\nP.S. For the record, yes Iam( another)\nChristian.\nP.P. S. No, I haven't shoved the gospel\ndown your neck, nor do I intend to drag\nthe entire Felix staff into the nearest\nchurch. If you want to know about\nChristianity, there are an ough Christian\ngroups in college for you to go and talk\nto. At least then there's a chance for a real time argument (on those lines, if\nanyone wants to come back to me on\nthis, drop me a line via the Physics\npigeonholes).\nArt and Money\nDear Andy,\nIn the (hopefully) last blast of the arts\nsubsidy debate, I will attempt to answer\nthe points I either (a) forgot, or (b) didn't make clear enough in my last reply.\n1. Don't be silly, Alan. Of course arts\naren't the only sub sidi sed leisure activity.\nLook at sports centres and training\ncourses sub sidi sed by local government.\nThey exist. I know because I 've been\nin/on them.\n2. Aren't we a clever bunny, Alan( pass\nthe shampoo..)? Taking a quote out of\ncontext is just about the oldest trick in\nthe book. What I was implying by that\nstatement was that people just don't think\nabout the theatre as a possibility. Apathy\nrather than antipathy.\n3. Alan asks why we don't solely\nproduce musicals etc. This is just like\nasking why TV doesn't show game shows\nall the time. They may be popular, but\nthey are intellectual popcorn, fun, but\nwith no nutritional value. This is really\nour fun de mental differ ance. Alan believes\nthat money is all important. I like to\nthink that there is more to the way we\nlive our than that.\n4. Good and sucessful are not\nsyn on my s. It is an unfortunate fact of life\nthat sometimes the trash su cee ds. Look at\nthe sucess of Kylie Minogue...\n5. I, and everyone else, called Alana bigot for one good reason. It's the best\nword.\nAs for the rest of Mr.Bailey's comments,\nall I can say is that he is steadily\ndestroying what small credibility he once\nhad.\nYours finally,\nPendragon (aka Adam Tinworth)\n\n"

The money, given to the College by the\nGovernment, forms what has become\nknown as the Access fund.\nMr Cullen, from the Registry, contacted\nSenior Tutors over two weeks ago,\nexpressing his concern at the subdued\nflow of applications. Although the tutors\nwere asked to further publicise the\nexistance of the fund in their\ndepartments, no flood materialise d. The good news for those who have\napplied this year is that Mr Cullen plans\nto distribute all of this year's fund. This is\nalso good news for future years as it\nprevents the Government cutting next\nyear's lump sum.\nMr Cullen has said that the Access fund\nis his number one priority. He will read\nover all applications next week and will\nstart making his golden handshake\ndecisions soon. The applications are not,\nas rumour had it, go j ng to be discussed\nby a committee. They are seen only by Mr Cullen who may consult with college\ntutors, Julia Higgins and David\nGoodgame.\nFor those who are not totally apathetic,\napplication forms are still available from\nroom 344 Sherfield.

These included Piers Corbyn, a past Union President (69-70), who had\nbeen involved in anti-Vietnam War campaigns at I.C. and is now a part-time\nweatherman and lecturer at South Bank\nPolytechnic.\nGroups from a wide political spectrum\nwere present including those from the\nGreen, Liberal and Labour Parties.

    "content": "Richard Eyers and Mick Jagger investigate.\nSpitting Image Unmasked FELIX\nHow it begins\u2014the guts of a model\nCovent Garden, home of the bus ker and\nstreet entertainer has just been taken\nover by, amongst others, Margaret\nThatcher. This out-of-work ex-PM can\nnow be found regularly appearing in a tacky budget game show. Lickety-Lick\nforms the centre point of a new venture\nin Covent Garden.\nPeter Fluck, already well known for the\nsatirical and generally offensive 'Spitting\nImage' has brought his characters and\nskill to the 'Rubberworks'.\nSince 15th December 1990, Prince\nCharles has been seen prowling the\nstreets around the Royal Opera House\ntrying to entice people into a small dark\ntunnel that leads into what looks like a small disused warehouse. In a small dark\nquadrangle you're met by ex-President of\nthe United States, Mr. Ronald Reagan,\nand a policeman dressed in boxer shorts.\nSound strange? You're right, it is, and by\nnow your pocket will be \u00a32.90 lighter,\nwith nothing to show for it. Suddenly\ndoors are thrust open and you are\nenticed into a dark dingy room. And then\nthe fun begins\nIt starts with a twitching of a giant\ntongue, and as the lights go up, the panel\nof Lickety-Lick are revealed. The\nchairman of this well known game-show\nis none other than Sir Alastair Burnet. His\nillustrious panel consists of Maggie, Neil\nKinnock and a couple of well known Royals, namely the Queen and the Duke\nof Edinburgh. The show lasts for about\nten minutes and is very reminiscent of\nthe TV show.\nWhilst watching the show, which is\nonly just too long, it is easy to imagine\nthe real characters in action. There is the\nalmost friendly bickering between Maggie\nand Neil, the odd suspect comment about\nthe Chinese from the Duke, and an\ninteresting relationship is struck up\nbetween Sir Alastair and the Queen,\nalthough the Duke, posed with his trusty\nweapon, actually a blunderbuss, seems\nnone too bothered by this.\nThe difference between the TV version\nand this show is that the characters are\n'live'. There are no puppeteers, instead a series of carefully arranged fire-hosing,\nlatex and silicon chips bring the\ncharacters to life. Lickety-Lick\ndemonstrates some of the newest\ntechnology in the puppet world, and after\nthe performance you get a chance to see\nbehind the scenes. The Rubberworks has\na full workshop set up, with a demonstrator guiding you through both\nthe history and the technical background\nof Spitting Image. Unfortunately, what\nmost people don't see is behind the\nscenes of Lickety-Lick, where all the\ntechnology is pulled together.\nIn a system invented by Peter Fluck\nand Jim Hennequin, sophisticated\ncomputer programming synchronise s prerecorded voices with a full range of\nbodily functions. It is the Flexator that\nhas made all this possible, an artificial\nmuscle worked by air. It provides life-like\nmovements that wouldn't be possible with\nconventional hydraulics. These are then\nclothed and covered in the rubber mould\nof the desired character. (Yes, even\nRonald Reagan was desired once!) A complex collection of circuits and valves\ncan then be linked to a computer, a joystick and a compressor and then the\nprogramming begins. It can take a skilled\noperator up to three days of computer\ntime to fully program the character. Once\nbuilt, a fully automated, talking model\nwill have cost between \u00a330,000 and\n\u00a340,000.\nMargaret Thatcher was the first to be\nproduced; she was finished in the middle\nof 1989. It then became possible to hire\nher for the day to speak to any audience\nanywhere, and have her say anything,\nsomething the Conservatives never quite\nmanaged with the real one. Following her\nsuccessful debut, further characters were\nbuilt for hire. The list is now long and\ndistinguished including such stars as John\nMajor, Oliver Reed and Gaz za for\nexample. They cost a mere \u00a32,500 per\nday which includes the speech of your\nchoice.\nIf all this seems a little expensive, a conventional model can be made for\naround \u00a37,000. They may be cheaper but\nMick and Jeremy, or Jeremy and Mick?\nThe brains and brawn of a character\nthey can require between three and five\npeople to operate them, with their hands\ncontrolling various parts of the puppets\nanatomy, depending upon what the\ncharacter requires. For example, Mick\nJagger's lips require one operator on their\nown.\nThe next series of Spitting Image begins\nin March, and with a cast of at least 500\ncharacters as diverse as Gorbachov and\nsmall parrots, the cost of each episode\nwill probably be in the region of \u00a340,000.\nThere are bound to be some new\ncharacters, with the potential for\ncontroversy better than ever at the\nmoment.\nThese models have also appeared in\nadverts around the world. The 'Halls\nMentholyptus' advert with an elephant's trunk and a giraffe's neck growing out of\na commuter are typical of Spitting's approach. They offend people, but\nbecause they amuse more than they\noffend they get away with it.\nIn the future it can only get worse or\nbetter depending on how you feel, with\nPeter Fluck diversifying further and\nfurther. The venture in Covent Garden is\njust a taste of what there is to come, noone is sacred, and there are plenty of\npeople that still deserve to be ridiculed\nby rubber and compressed air.\n8 9\n\n"

    "content": "Anna Teeman faces up to the monetary realities of war...\nGulf Economics FELIX\nBack in August, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait\nprecipitated a massive increase in the\nprice of oil. The cost of oil rose a staggering 100% to over $40 per barrel.\nIraq posed a threat to the world economy\non two fronts: it jeopardized the supply of\noil - a crucial raw material - and now had\nthe power to impose global inflation on a world still in the grips of a recession.\nBut where did the magical $40 per\nbarrel come from? The increase absorbed\nthe following: the loss of the Kuwaiti\ncontribution to the world oil supply (8%\nof the total), the winter increase in oil\nconsumption and what is known as a 'war risk premium'. This premium was\nthe dominant factor. It was calculated on\nthe assumption that Iraq had the military\ncapability to cripple oil production in\nother Persian gulf states including Saudi\nArabia.\nWhy then has the price of oil now\nfallen to well under $30 per barrel?\nWinter has been milder than predicted\n(difficult to believe after wearing woolly\ngloves in a lecture theatre) and the 'war\nrisk premium' proved to be an\noverestimate. If Iraqi scuds are inaccurate\nenough to hit the villages of beleaguered\nPalestinians, sympathetic to Iraq, then\nthey pose a barely credible threat to the\ndefended oil installations of the Gulf.\nThe international oil community, in\nallowing the price of oil to fall, has not\nconsidered the obliteration of Kuwait's oil\ninfrastructure by a retreating Iraqi army.\nThe original rise in oil price was partly\nbased on the current loss of Kuwaiti oil\nnot on the possible destruction of the\nentire oil industry. Such an event would\nherald a rise in oil price and global\ninflation.\nBritain has already felt the warmth of\nthe Gulf's inflationary flame. Because of\nthe initial rise in oil price the inflation\npeak came later in Britain last year than\nearlier. The Conservative government is\nobsessed with controlling inflation and\nsees it as not just a primary factor of\neconomic policy, but the only one. The\ngovernment keeps interest rates high,\nsledge-hammering inflation and deepening\nrecession. Britain is trapped in a recession\nfuelled by high interest rates and now by\nwar. War walks hand in hand with\nrecession because, during wartime,\nconsumer and business confidence is\nshattered. People are too scared to spend\nmoney, so they save instead, reducing the\nvolume of transactions and thereby\nsparking a recession. Additionally war\ncosts money; money that must be\nremoved from the remainder of the\neconomy. The less money in the\neconomy the greater the recession.\nIn the past week the British economy\nhas been further weakened by a rise in\nGerman interest rates and an associated\nrise in German exchange rates. Put\nsimply, the pound Sterling is now worth\nless in relation to the Deutschmark. The\nGermans are portrayed as selfish and\nirresponsible to make such a move at a time of not only recession but war. They\nhave, of course, made a hefty financial\ncontribution to the communal coffers -sniffed at because they haven't even sent\n'their boys' to be butchered in the Gulf.\nAnd what of Japan, another cowardly\ncustard, throwing its coins into the box?\nHow can countries which, by their post-Second-World-War constitutions, are\nforbidden to take part in international\nconflicts sail gung-ho to the Gulf?\nA1% fall in growth rate is forecast for\nboth the German and Japanese\neconomies. America, on the other hand,\nis about to receive billions of dollars from\naround the world to fund the\npredominantly American force in the\nGulf. However the American force in the\nGulf is paid for: the equipment is bought\nand the wages are already budgeted.\nAdmittedly there will be additional costs;\nthe loss equipment and use of live\nammunition. However economists are\npredicting a considerable surplus.\nHow will this surplus be spent? Not on\ndefence: significant cuts in the American\ndefence budget were announced by Mr Bush last week. There are other\ndeserving causes including a burgeoning\nbudget deficit and a crippled economy.\n\n"
