    "content": "10 COLUMNS 25 March 1998\nCook is under heat again.\nIt appears that his latest\nforay into another world\nregion has resulted in the\nusual gaffes, snubs and insults.\nCook has been written about\nbefore, at length, and my opinion\nof him had never been ecstatic. His\nperformance in the United States,\nIndia, Europe and so on, plus his\npublic and disgraceful treatment of\nhis wife of twenty-eight years (who\nhas now just divorced him, leaving\nhim free to marry his secretary)\nnever endeared him to the public.\nHis ability to weigh on delicate\narguments between various factions has resulted in many comparisons with Northern Ireland.\nRecently he went on a tour of the\nMiddle East, and came back with\nabuse from all sides.\nCook's troubles have led many\nto re-evaluate their opinion of the\nworthiness of the job of Foreign\nSecretary. Considered by many to\nthe best job in the Cabinet, it is the\nhighest position in it save that of\nPrime Minister, conferring perks\nand privileges, plus the opportunity\nto leave the constricting grasp of\ndomestic politics and worries, and\nlook at the wider world issues and\nproblems. However it is also the\nmost punishing of Cabinet appoint-ment s. Travelling is constant,\npaperwork ever-coming and diary\npacked. And for the most part, the\nwork is the slow grind of diplomacy\nwhich is always required but will\nconfer no great historical distinction upon the person concerned.\nYet upon their shoulders rests the\nresponsibility to deal with some of\nthe great historical conflicts of the\nworld.\nOne of those conflicts is the\nIsraeli-Palestinian 'peace process',\nas it is still called in politer diplomatic circles. Cook's foray into\nIsrael and Palestine caused numerous upsets, with changes of plan\nand rewritten schedules at the last\nminute to accommodate aggrieved\nrepresentatives of various sides of\nthe divide. Even the U.S. State\nDepartment is agitated , with\nwhat else can a well-populated\ncontinent, residing just to the west\nof the said area, some of whose countries governed Middle East\nnations in days of Empire, whose\nworkforce and student population\nwork and study in each others\nregions, that has historical links\n(and battles) going back to pre his tory, actually know? Unless, as is\nexpected, Europe simply doesn't understand Europe from the perspective of the good Mr Netanyahu.\nHamish Common\nWestminster Eye\nspokesmen remarking that recent\nevents have \"not helped\". Cook\nhimself downgraded his own intentions, saying in an after-dinner\nspeech to the Anglo Arab Association that he hoped to give\nthe peace process \"a helpful\nnudge\".\nThe problems behind this lie\ndeeper than just what happened in\nthe Middle East last week. When Cook outlined his intentions for the\nEuropean Union to take a larger\nrole in the Middle East, the Israeli\nPrime Minister, Binyamin\nNetanyahu retorted that Europe\n'doesn't understand the Middle East'. To offer a personal opinion.\nEuropean countries, and Britain\nin particular, have always been fairly pro-Arab. Many of their heads of\nstate were educated in British public schools, and British diplomats\ncan usually expect warm handshakes from Arab hands. Israel, on\nthe other hand, was created in the\nwake of the Second World War,\ndepending then, as it does now, on\nU.S. support for its survival (until\nrecently, every state bordering on it\nhad an agreement to exterminate it\nif at all possible). The U.S. Government in turn benefits greatly\nfrom the support of the powerful\nJewish lobby. By such things are\nforeign policy decided. So when Cook talks of Britain and Europe\ntaking a larger role, it can only\nmean bad news for Israel, as far as\nNetanyahu can work out. Even\nthough Britain supported the U.S. is its stance against Iraq and\nSaddam Hussein, one of Israel's greatest foes in modern times,\nIsrael fundamentally distrusts\nBritain. If even the United States,\nwho is undoubtedly the No.1 Peacebroker in the region cannot\npresently navigate its way to a deal,\nBritain's infinitely weaker foreign\npolicy strength doesn't stand a chance.\nThe biggest barrier it seems is\nBinyamin Netanyahu himself. King\nHussein of Jordan wrote to him a year ago asking him why 'he was\nout to destroy everything he'd worked for in his life'. Netanyahu\ncontinues to have settlements built\nin what is clearly on the Palestinian\nside of the line. Most observers feel\nthat Netanyahu has torn up the\nentire process and imposed his\nown view on Israeli sovereignty to\nthe area. He will probably have to\ngo for a solution to be achieved.\nThe greater worry on our Prime\nMinister's mind will be his own\nimpending tour to the region. Blair\nis at his best dispensing kind words\nand platitudes, smoothing ruffled\nfeathers and nurturing egos. Cook's recent legacy could leave Biair in a hard diplomatic position. One hopes for Cook's sake that Blair is\nnot made a fool of, for then Cook's position in the Foreign Office will\nbe increasingly untenable.\nPrpQcOaw Hflgfitf P \u00a9w \u00a9rp\nYou' ve seen the film, some of you have lived through the decade, and now you can enjoy the full 70s experience that is the BOOGIE NIGHTS CARNIVAL.

Many shells landed in potentially lethal\nlocations, including some devices that landed on the\nroof of busy Terminal 4\nand others that fell close\nto passenger planes. Luckily all the bombs failed\nto explode.\nMichael Gallagher, the\nfifty-five year old protagonist, was convicted of conspiring to cause\nexplosions by a jury majority of\neleven to one. His girlfriend,\nforty-three year old Dr. Mary Attenborough, the daughter of a retired local government education officer, was apparently stunned by the verdict, after giving evidence that completely backed Gallagher's defence. The\nformer IC student was born in\nWalsall in the West Midlands and\njoined the Young Communist The police got their first major\nlead on the bombing when they\nwere contacted by Colin Garneys,\na businessman whose suspicions\nhad been aroused by the\nbomber's activities. Gallagher had\nbeen renting a lockup garage for\nseveral months from Mr. Gar ney s under a false\nname. The police subsequently bugged the rental\ncompany' s phone line, and| thus began a two year surveillance operation. Gallagher's conversations were also monitored at the\n\u2022 BMp former ICU President's house, where the couple\nOy p lived.\nii j ii j l Michael Gallagher' sH Mp defence relied heavily on\n' his assertion that his act iv i:s around London con HB j is ted solely for the purpose of gathering material\nfor a novel. Despite backing from his girlfriend, the\nMary Attenborough on winning the 1978 prosecution stressed that\npresidential election there was no evidence s ug Photo: Felix Archive ge sting she knew anything\nabout his IRA involvement,\nLeague when still at school, going on to study mathematical physics\nat Imperial College. Elected\nPresident of Imperial College Union for the academic year\n1978-79, she subsequently lectured at South Bank University.\nand the bomber was sentenced,\nby to twenty years' imprisonment. SABBATICAL IN\nDRUGS ARREST\nfrom front page\njob may have been a factor, with\neighty-hour weeks a common occurrence. According to a source\nclose to the accused, the ploy may\nhave been inspired by the Oxford\nUniversity student newspaper\nCherwell which last year attached a number of cannabis seeds to each\nissue.\nDetails have yet to emerge on\nthe possible implications for the\neditor and indeed the newspaper\nitself, but the student contributors\nwere said to be bewildered by the\nnews. One writer said: \"It's terrible;\nit was difficult enough to get everything finished on time even with the\nsupport and guidance of a full-time\nsabbatical officer. Eddie is coping\nadmirably, but I hope for Jeremy's sake, and for the sake of the paper,\nthat these allegations prove to be\nfalse.\" It remains to be seen\nwhether Mr Thomson will be available to compete his duties next\nterm. However, it is expected that\nhe will be granted bail by today.\nWhile it is still not known if the\naccusations are true, anyone in\npossession of a copy of Felix 1111\nis advised to surrender it to any of\nthe Imperial College Security\nlodges. Under no circumstances\nshould any attempt to ingest the\ncover be made, as the quantities of\nany drug that may be present are\nunknown and could be hazardous.\nEnd of the Road for Bo and Jez?\nTONY OFORI\nSeveral societies could face\nsevere cuts in their budgets following Union Finance Council\n(UFC) proposals.\nThe intention is that the\nmotorised mascots societies for\nthe R SMU, RCSU and C&. GU as well\nas the ICU Art Society will receive\nvirtually no subsidy from the Union\nnext year.\nFollowing a Budget Advisory\nGroup (BAG) meeting in which the\nbudgets of all ICU societies were\nreviewed, a recommendation was\nput forward questioning the viability of sub sidi sing the arts oc and the\nmotorised mascots clubs. On Tuesday 1 7 March, the UFC held a meeting to decide the future of\nfinances for the next academic year\nfor these societies. In an emergency meeting scheduled to be\nheld tomorrow, a final decision will\nbe made by Union Council on\nwhether Artsoc will have their budget cut from \u00a3 1 5 0 0 to \u00a3 2 0 0 .

The\nreasoning behind it was\nas Andy He eps, ICU\nPresident, stated \"no\nother society\nreceives the\ntypes of benefits as the\nArtsoc\", making them \"easy tar-gets\" to bear the brunt of the cuts.\nThe motorised mascots clubs\nwill be hit even harder if the UFC's for the constituent cole ges may\nbecome redundant.

The\nmascots are \"a long standing part\nof college history\" that travel up\nand down the country assisting in\ncharity work and the general promotion of IC \"helping to fly the flag\nfor the University\". The money\nfrom the Union is only spent on the\nmaintenance of the vehicles: all\nother money for petrol, etc. is provided by the volunteers that look\nafter them.\n\n"

With Lucid Dreaming \"Last night I dreamt that 1 was a butterfly.\nNow1 don't know whether I was a man\ndreaming 1 was a butterfly or Iam a butterfly dreaming I a maman.\" The dream world, while we are in it, is just\nas logical and genuine as what we jokingly\ncall reality. Whether it is God or physics at\nthe controls, the world is an immense\nmechanism of the possible and the likely in\nwhich play a tiny part. We have only a min-i mal, physical influence on our surround-in gs. Yet everybody harbors secret wishes\nof the impossible; to travel in time; to\nmake love to the most desirable partners\nimaginable; to be the world's greatest gui-tar is t; to move out of their body; or to fly\nat will. When we are awake, such things\nare impossible. When we are asleep, they\ncalled lucid dreaming.\nit. If left to chance, such events are rare\nand lack clarity. Fortunately, it is possible to\nlearn how to achieve a lucid state regularly\nand to use the awareness to increase your\ncontrol over the dream\nWhile public knowledge of lucid dreaming\nis only recently becoming widespread, it is\nfar from being a new discovery. As early as\nthe eighth century the subject received\nextensive study by Tibetan Yogis who claimed to have almost total control over\ntheir dreams. However, the first modern\nfigure to examine the phenomenon was the\nMarquis d 'Hervey de Saint-Denys, a dedicated researcher who recorded his own dreams from the age of thirteen. In his first\nyoung researcher - StephefBtaBerge - to\nset the discovery on a scientific found a tion. His book, Lucid Dreaming is the\ndefinitive work on the subject;; His research\ncontinues to this day via;? the Lucidity\nInstitute, an organisation he founded to\npromote research and interest in lucid\ndreaming.\nStephen LaBerge has also invented a method of training to help people achieve\nand use lucidity, known as the MILD tech-ni que. This method has been used to great\nsuccess, with a few students becoming\nlucid on the first attempt. Usually it will\ntake several weeks or pds si bly months to\nlearn and, as they say, a lifetime to master.\nHave confidence in the techniques, and be\npersistent, and the potential rewards are\nunlimited.\nLucid dreaming is the ability to become\nconscious or 'awake' while in a dream,\nand thus becoming able to take control\nnot only of your actions, but of your sur-rounding s. All of the 'impossibilities'\nabove are easily achieved and more - the\nonly limit being your imagination.\nRemember also that events and feeling\nexperienced while dreaming are at least\nas convincing and real as those in waking\nlife and it becomes difficult to see why\nyou would ever want to be awake. A dream is no longer a place where you are\na helpless victim, but a place to dismiss\nthe cares and concerns of waking life and\ndo exactly what you like.\nThe key to lucid dreaming is becoming\naware, while you are asleep, that you are\nexperiencing a dream. Most people will\nbe able to recall dreams where this has\nhappened, and may have even used the\nawareness to direct the dream, perhaps\nby facing a nightmare situation to defeat\nEvents and feeling experienced while dreaming are\nat least as convincing and\nreal as those in waking\nThis first step in the MILD technique is\nimproving dream recall. Usually, dreams\nare largely or totally forgotten by the\ndreamer unless they are awoken while a dream is still in progress. This selective\namnesia probably evolved to prevent\ndreams interfering with man's understanding of waking life. However, it is both possible and interesting to learn to recall your\ndreams.\nbook, Dreams and How to Guide Them\n(1867), he outlined the methods by which\nhe was able to recall dreams, become\naware of them and ultimately to control\nthem. This work was picked up this century by a Dutch psychiatrist Van Eeden, who published the remarkable paper, A Study of\nDreams, which coined the name lucid\ndreaming. It can be read in full at\nwww.phoenix.net/~blake.\nThe next major in dream study was a scientific one - from around 1952 it became possible to electronically measure brain activity.\nSeveral excellent works were published (see\nbibliography), and these advances inspired a An important part of dream recall is getting a good night's sleep. This allows you\nto focus better on the dreams and leaves\ntime to record them while still getting sufficient rest. Furthermore, the REM periods\nin which dreams occur become both more\nregular and more prolonged during the\nnight. You will also need a notebook and\npen for recording recollections.

Wash your spuds but don't bother peeling them. Chop the\npotatoes into ~ 1\" cubes and put\nthem in a large pan with enough\nwater to cover. Bring to the boil\nover a strong heat and leave to\nsimmer for 10 minutes. Now drain\nthe potatoes, place a top onto the\npan and shake the pan vigorously.\nThis \"roughens\" the pieces so they\nabsorb more fat and become crispy when cooked. Next pour a generous amount of oil (and/or\nbutter) into the pan, sprinkle with\nlots of salt, pepper and any other\nherbs and give the contents a good stir. The spuds are now ready to\njoin whatever you've got in the\noven. They'll need at least an hour\nat gas mark 5-6, 180-200\u00b0C and\nit's a good idea to turn them at\nleast once whilst they're cooking.\nROUSSETTES DILE-DE-FRANCE\nSo here's a \"traditional French del-ica cy\" which is usually cooked to\ncelebrate the middle of Lent, just\nto give you some encouragement\nafter eating stale bread and olive\nstones for however many weeks it\nis.\nThe dough needs to rest and\nchill overnight so you have to make\nit the day before which this year\nwas the 18th March so whoops sorry, you've missed it. Still, mine\nwere very nice and I'm sure you can do some for Easter or some-thing.\nDo be careful when using the\ndeep fat fryer and keep a substantial wet cloth about to throw over it\nif things get furious.\n1 litre (550g) plain flour\n3 large eggs\n\u00ae- 125 g butter\n1 pinch salt\na\"1 tsp sprit (preferably fruit)\nT.1 tsp orange blossom or\nrose water\n\u00ab\u2022 3-4 heaped tsp thick\ncream\n1 deep fat fryer\nFirst of all, cut the butter into small\nbits and put in a bowl on something warm like a radiator. When the butter softens (not melts) stir it\naround with a fork until you've got\na smooth paste.\nPlace the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the\nmiddle. Break all three eggs into\nthe well and, using the fork, whisk\nthem around in the flour. When about half the flour is incorporated\nyou should have a paste with a similar consistency to the butter.\nSo add the butter and churn it into\nthe paste, picking up flour as you\ngo along. This might be a good time to get your hands in there -you should end up with a stiff\ndough that doesn't stick together.\nAnd now for the really gooey\nmoment. Add2 tsp of cream to\nthe dough and squid ge repeatedly\nuntil the cream is absorbed. Keep\nadding more cream until you get\nthe right consistency. For those of\nyou who have ever repair a win-dow, you're looking for something\nwith the same consistency as\nputty, fairly stiff but plastic.\nThat's it for now, wrap up in\ncellophane and leave in the fridge\nfor the night.\nThe next day, lightly flour a clean\nsurface and using your favourite\nrolling pin (mine's a litre bottle of\nScotch) roll out the dough until it's23 mm thick.\nUse a blunt knife to cut the\npastry into lozenges. Press the\nknife down onto the pastry rather\nthan dragging it across so that the\nedges are well sealed. This will\nhelp the rousse tte s to expand in\nthe cooking. One of those dinky\npastry wheel job bie s would be perfect for the job.\nTo cook the rousse tte s, heat\nthe oil up gently and plop the\nlozenges in a few at a time. I don't know what temperature this\nneeds, I 've always used trial and\nerror. What should happens is that\nafter a couple of seconds, the\nlozenge expands from the steam\nproduced inside it and pops up to\nthe surface of the oil. Leave it for\n10 seconds and then flip it over\nwith a suitable utensil. After another 10 seconds take the rousse tte s out and place on some absorbent\nmaterial. At this point and despite\nits name, the rousse tte should be\njust golden yellow (ahh) not brown.\nIf it is brown, the oil's too hot.\nFinally, sprinkle your rous-set te with icing sugar and scoff\nwith a bit of jam.\nAntoine\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS\nI HAIRCUT\n\u00a38.00\nUNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX\nINCLUDES:3 r~ CONSULTATION with stylist to discuss your style, try\na new look and learn how to manage and control your hair.\n=\n3\n*\n- SHAMPOO followed by Herbal Conditioner and scalp massage.

Your second album was produced by Delfeayo\nMarsalis; they are quite a family, aren't they?\nOh yeah, they are phenom eon al,I mean\nwith Bran ford doing the Buckshot\nLoFonque thing, you've got Stig from the\nJay Leno show, he finally had a hit\nrecord, Wynton doing all his classical\nstuff, there's a brother Jason Marsalis\nwho plays the drums; a good drummer.\nAnd Ellis [the boys' father, responsible for, amongst\nother things, the jazz associated with the Snoopy TV\ncartoons]...\nOh yeah, Ellis as well. I worked with Ellis\non a record, they are all so talented. I'm good friends with Bran ford; he and I have\nsocial is ed several times Haughsl. He is\nvery su port ive of what we do over here\nWhat are you going to do next? What is next for\njazz?\n/ don't know about jazz, but me I'm going\nto take it a lot deeper. Deeper and deep-er. There are certain types of music that I like, like drum and bass for instance, and\nI have to incorporate that to a greater\ndegree, also the way that we record ear-lier, I'd like to have the feedback thing like\nAdam F and Grooverider, which is what\nI'm trying to do with this remix album. I think that I 'll be doing that a lot more. I want to increase the width of the people\nwho listen, not just jazz guys who know\nCharlie Parker; in fact the guys who\nwould never listen to jazz.\nWho is left for you to record with?\nOh there are so many people, I 've never\nrecorded with Wynton. I would love to do\nsome recordings with Tricky. I 've listened\nto Echobelly; I love her voice. I did the\nBBC charity thing over Christmas, Perfect\nDay, and I was supposed to meet Eternal,\nbut the lead singer couldn't make it, so I didn't meet them. Morcheeba! They've\ngot good flavour. The new Eels record,\nthat gave me food for thought, and I met\nthem, and you know what; we were all\nlistening to the same records; Fun Lovin'\nCriminals, Cypress Hill. All these combinations from across the globe, they are all\nending up in England.\nI'm actually a jazz er myself; I play alto saxo-phone. What advice would you give to someone\nlike me?\nBe as open-minded as possible. If you\nare an alto player, you have to cover\nthe ground. If you wanna start now,\nyou could do David Sanborn, you\nknow, don't spend too much time on\nthat. If you wanna be an artist, go into\nthe 'sixties and do, say, Woody\nCogan. Pick seven songs that these\n! guys have done, and just learn them.\nThen, go back to the 'fifties; you\ncould do Charlie Parker, Phil Woods...\nThat's where I'm sitting, definitely...\n... then go back to Johnny Hodges\nand even further, y 'know; the further you\ngo back, the easier it will be to do contemporary stuff. A lot of guys just concentrate on, well, you know David\nSanborn is commercial, people know it so\nlet's get that sound, and they don't get\nthe real deal The further you go back the\neasier it will be to understand someone\nwho is con tempo ary at the moment. Also,\ntry and learn about other instruments; the\neasiest way to do that is to use computer technology. Before, it was, \"Oh yeah,\nyou learn the piano.\" Y 'know, the piano\nwas the computer; you have to learn\nsomething about harmony, if you're an\ninstrumentalist. So the piano is essential.\nBut the computer, now, in this day and\nage, is just as important.\nHow would you like to be remembered?\nOoh, well... that's a difficult one.\nObviously I'd like to change the face of\nBritish jazz. It's really hard to say these\nthings, they always come out the wrong\nway when you read them back! But I would definitely like to be someone who\nis seen as trying to make and improve jazz\nmusic, and speak at this time for our gen-e ration; just in the same way that Charlie\nParker, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald,\nColtrane and Wayne Shorter did.\nY 'know, I wanna do the same job.\nCourtney Pine was talking with Jonathan Trout.\n\n"

They've tried to reduce the\nmonotony by sticking in a couple\nof ballads, but these are worse\nthan the 'in yer face' songs.\nThe Dust Junkys lyrics are\nabout drugs, fights, women and\nwasting people who get in their\nway, although you always get the\nimpression that they're all talk and\nno substance, d jason\nURUSEI\nYATSURA\nSlain By Urusei Yatsura\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThese Glaswegian lo-fi indie\nterrorists have been thrashing\naround for the last couple of\nyears, and were heaped with praise\nby excited music journ os, glad for a break from the ruling Britpop norm\nat the time. This band brought a 'fuck you' attitude to the whole\nhappy, chummy music biz world.\nTheir attitudes have not changed\nan inch since their debut We Are\nUrusei Yatsura, and to be honest\nthey have probably taken them further to a scarier level, where they\nshout about 'Killing Your Parents....'\nand giving a big fat middle finger to\nthe industry they hate to be a part\nof.\nG/o Starz kicks the album off\nwith the opening line of 'I'm sorry,\nI'm sorry , I'm sorry, I'm sorry', but\ndon't misunderstand their intentions. They are NOT a polo gi sing in\nadvance for the album. The next\ntrack that follows is the mightily\naddictive Hello Tiger, a perfect\npiece of messed up squealing\nthrash y power pop that you feel\nyou have to experience live to gain\nthe full and bloody effect. This is a real grower, all the melodies, which\nleap out at you whilst hidden between the axe grinding of the\nguitars and shout y lyrics, insinuate\nthemselves into your thoughts.\nIt is a relief to hear some unashamed distorted guitars and Pixies like inclinations from a relatively new band. They are probably\nnot old enough to have been\nweaned on Frank Black and co.'s exciting take on guitar rock.\nWhatever they were listening to, it\nmust have been good, or appallingly bad (which explains the direction\nthey've taken). The shout y vocals\nare so reminiscent of fellow\nGlaswegians Bis, but thankfully Bis\nended up careering down the path\nto washed out headache inducing\nboredom, while Urusei Yatsura did\nthemselves a favour and steered\nwell clear.\nAs a live band you get the\nimpression they must kick ass, the\nenergy that lifts the album up on record must be intensely manic on\nstage.\nIf you are slain after listening to\nthis record, then it is probably the\nbest way to go.

Well it seems that the hammer drill\nof history has once more been\nplunged into quivering vicar's abdomen of time and another term\nis at an end. To celebrate this your\nbeloved Felix has been imbued with\na splash of colour.\nSpeaking of colour (watch this\nlink) 1 must congratulate all those\nwho have been awarded College\ncolours (Look at that! Perfectly\nseamless. Quality journalism that\nis). The achievements in '97 of the\nCollege's sports heroes have been\nacknowledged. Of course I have no\ndoubt that for every person who received an award, there were countless others equally deserving.\nTo those people I offer my sym p athies and can only remind them of\nthe words of Mr James Brown;\n\"I 've got mine, who cares about his\n(or hers).\" Congratulations must\ngo to Jenny Cox who won Sportsperson of the Year and Charlie Joynt who was judged\nSports Personality of the Year.\nAs anyone who pays any attention to the goings on in the Felix\nsports pages (yes I know what\nyou're thinking but just exercise\nsome willing suspension of d is be lief) will be aware, this term marks\nthe debut of both me and my jolly\nband of helpers. I would therefore\nlike to thank the various sports\nteams for being patient and understanding with me. For those of you who have not been patient and\nunderstanding, a) Please disregard\nthe previous statement and b) why\ndon't you bugger off and dive into\nthe nearest sewer like the miserable vermin that you are.\nWhilst it pains me to touch on\nthis subject, I feel that 1 must com ment upon the sad events involving\nyour friend and mine, Felix editor\nJeremy Thomson. It is a terrible\nstate of affairs that people are so\nquick to pounce upon the misfortunes of others for their own amusement. For myself, I stand\nfour square behind Jeremy. I ask\nyou to consider this, is it a crime to\ndouse copies of Felix in illegal\ndrugs in an attempt to induce mass\nhallucinations? Think about it.\nIn a way I feel in somewhat\nguilty for Jeremy's predicament.\nWhen he told me of his desire for\npeople to appreciate Felix on a whole new level, I was very sup-port ive. Of course 1 had no idea of\nthe lengths to which he was planning to go.\nThis plan is not new, every\nweek members of certain sports\nteams provide me with reports\nsoaked in beer, presumably as part\nof some plan to get me drunk;\nJeremy's current ordeal should,\nhowever, make them a pause for\nthought.\nIt cannot have escaped your\nattention by now that Iam writing\nnonsense. This is due to a desperate attempt to fill the two pages\nthat I have been assigned. I must\nsay that Iam most disappointed by\nthe lack of articles for this, the last\nissue of term. 1 am sure that many\nof you were involved in sporting\ncontests, surely you can all have\nlost under humiliating c irc um stances (ski team).\nErm, sports.

Rah Rah Rasputin\nRussia's greatest love machine, it\nwas a shame how he carried on.\nArrrgh Sports! Must write about\nsports, sports, not releasing\nanthrax into the London Underground, laughing as people\nmake the journeys, little suspecting\nthe tortured death that awaits\nthem, dancing with joy as the bo dies pile up like rotting pyramids of\ndeath. That'll show them, always\ntalking about me, tripping me up,\nreading my brainwaves, they\nthought I didn't know, but 1 do and\nmy vengeance shall be swift and\nterrible.\nWell that little journey into my\nstream of consciousness seems to\nhave filled up some space, it only\nremains for me to say that whilst I shall continue for as long as possible next term, at some point I shall\nhave to take the few paltry scraps\nof information 1 have acquired over\nthe last year and try to stick them\ntogether in the hope that they\nvaguely resemble a degree. Still I have no doubt that my colleagues\nDave and Niall shall prove themselves more than capable of filling\nthe vacuum that my departure shall\ncreate.\nWar! Hurl Good God!

After a final\nnarrow defeat we were tired,\npissed off and ready to go; however we were required to enter the\nplay-offs which were due to start in\nan hour; so we went down the pub.\nRefreshed, we returned and,\nunder the sterling guidance of the\nmanic Dr Dennis 'Don't be shy'\nGarriga-Majo, went on to win three\nmatches in a row with the alcoholic ally fuelled and aggressive Andrew\n'Doesn't hit girls' Schnoes wreaking\nfoil-like havoc with a succession of\nopponents.

    "content": "25 March 1998 COLUMNS\nOnce you've been at Imperial for\na while, you soon realise that\nsimplicity rarely features strongly in the thinking of our lords\nand masters. Last week, for\nexample, we came top in the\nHEFCE funding tables, easily\nbeating lesser establishments in\nthe Fens and west of London.\nAcross the College, we have\nbeen more successful than many\nin securing extra funding grants\nfrom industry and research\ncouncils, which has helped IC\npass the \u00a3 3 0 0 million mark. Yet\ndespite all this, the College are\nnow seeking to deprive the\nUnion of \u00a3 4 2 , 0 0 0 generated by\nSTA Travel; incidentally, this figure is not far off the amount\nspent in 1996/97 redecorating\nand refurbishing the palatial 170\nQueen's Gate, about \u00a3 4 9 , 0 0 0 .\nThough I would be the first to\nadmit that ICU does not dispense all of its cash in the most\neffective manner, it is difficult to\nbelieve that this latest move is\nanything but sour grapes from\nthe denizens of Suite Five, who\nfailed to make the Union pay for\nthe refurbishment of the JCR, a College facility. Were the Union\nto stump up for the renovation\nof College facilities, it would set\na dangerous precedent, in much\nthe same way that Labour's tinkering with National Lottery is\nworrying. Such poor judgement,\ntinged with bitterness, hypocrisy\nand naivet e, does the Rector no\ncredit at all, and must be\nreversed immediately. The last\ntime 1 looked,\nthe College had\ncash balances of\n\u00a3 1 4 million, further weakening\nthe case for\nraiding the\nUnion's coffers.\nFurthermore, the\nwhole sorry saga\nhighlights the\nmisplaced priorities of the\nCollege. The JCR\nis seen purely as\na cost rather than a benefit. If\nwe continue to run down facilities for students, we will find it\nprogressively more difficult to\nattract applications. We cannot\nsurvive purely on past glories -we must provide a high quality\neducation in a high quality environment. Were this under fund ing limited to social facilities,\nthe effects might mot be critical,\nbut one only has to wander\nyj j Ijf\ntT3 Ijf\nDQ\nCoE I/O through teaching labs around\nImperial to see how Campus\nRenaissance is largely an exercise in window dressing, failing\nto address major weaknesses in\nfavour of the odd fountain here\nand there. Yes, we have the shiny\nnew BMS, but if we persist in\nneglecting our\nfacilities, its\narrival will\nmerely exacerbate the problem in years to\ncome, when\none considers\nthat its maintenance budget\nwill be almost\n60% of Estates\nentire current\n^ J maintenance provision. Since\nmany senior College staff have\nlittle time for undergraduates,\nlet me approach this from a different angle. If we let this place\ncontinue to decay, it will not be\nlong before industrial sponsors\ngo elsewhere. Now do you see\nmy point?\nThe Budget, as a rule, should\nnot set the pulse racing, since\nfiscal policy, like nuclear\nweaponry, is a area\nwhere panic is best\navoided. On reflection, Gordon\nBrown talked much and said lit-tle. Normally an occasion where\ngovernments are more forthcoming than usual, he still man\naged to pack in a few New\nLabour vagaries and platitudes.\nTaxing child benefit will be\n'investigated', though reforming\none of the most unjustifiable\nuniversal benefits should be relatively straightforward. While\nbeing tight on spending, he did\nnothing to rein in the pound,\nwhich has clear consequences\nfor exporters. There were some\ngood ideas, many of them mundane but nonetheless useful, but\noverall one cannot help but\nnotice that the Budget has failed\nto live up to the carefully\norchestrated leaks and spin.\nThis was not quite as prudent as\nGordon suggested, and is perhaps explained by the New\nLabour belief that you can fool\nall of the people all of the time.\nThought For the Day\nSex\nLooking back on it, it seems difficult to believe that I originally learnt the following epigram from a skateboard magazine:\nthat was back in my fourteen-year\nold days of dirty Cons 100 basketball boots, track-suit bottoms and... well, track-suit tops. The epigram sums up life rather well, and it\ngoes something like this: \"Life is a100% fatal, sexually transmitted\ndisease.\" Most people are likely to\nfind that this handful of words does\nnot quite typify their experience on the subject, but I reckon any cynic\nworth his or her salt will be in full\nagreement. My opinion, in case\nanyone is interested, is utterly irrelevant: it's been so long since 1 last\nhad sex that I honestly can't remember enough to comment. For some bizarre reason, sex\nhas a firm stigma of humour attached to it, and this seems to be\ninterpreted differently in England to\nthe way it is in any other nation.\nThink about the best (and the\nworst) jokes that you have heard\nrecently; how many would you consider a tad on the salacious\nside? It seems strange that something which is traditionally not disc us sed in polite conversation\nresults in a great many chuckles\nand guffaws in bars and on TV\nshows across the country. (\"Huh\nhuh. You said \"column\".\")\nSomeone once told me, in their\ninfinite wisdom, that the offhand\nportrayal of sex on the television\nwas a thing not to be encouraged,\nfor a number of reasons including\ndistortion of the minds of impressionable young adolescents. She\nreckoned sex should be what you make of it. You might be doubtful\nabout this assertion, but you should\nalso be able to see the truth in it;\nI'd be very surprised if anybody\nreading this has done it Sharon\nStone style. Teenagers who model\ntheir sexual style on the contortions\nof over-made up actors on Sky\nMovies One are likely to spend\nmost of their time in the bedroom\nattempting to find a piece of cloth\nlong enough to tie their partner to\nthe bed. Alternatively, they search\nthe length of the King's Road for a pair of fishnet stockings, rather\nthan shopping for condoms, which\nstill hardly ever make an appearance on the big screen.\nAlthough I have lived my entire\nlife in the shadow of the work of\nFreud, it is possible to imagine a world before we were exposed to\nhis particular brand of enlighten-ment. I reckon lots of people didn't even know where to stick it back\nthen. Again, strange as this retro\nand sex-ignorant society might\nappear, Iam sure that many couples achieve a lot of pleasure\nthrough the experience of sexual\ndiscovery, rather than having it all\npresented to them in the clinical,\nsoulless jargon of the psychologist.\nAs I sit here clam our ing for\nanother hundred words' worth of\nideas from my journalistic col-leagues, one cry goes up: \"Sex is\noverrated!\" Pessimistic 1 may be,\nbut one only has to look at the\nhordes of couples who have been\nmarried for thirty years or more to\nsee the silver lining. Let me finish,\nthen, with a tacky epigram of my\nown: sex is like opening a bank\nvault. You don't need dynamite,\nyou just need the right\ncombination.\nAll Campbell\n\n"

We' ve also done a live\nlink up with the Counting Crowes at the Albert\nHall, and have had D) Hurricaine (DJ with the\nBeastie Boys) in to do a set, as well as broadcasting a specially recorded set with Money Mark.

He plays a fast-talking\nsmall-time con-artist wrongly\nblamed for a deadly prison break.\nBaddies and goodies are all after\nhim and his only hope rests with\ngravel voiced cynical newsman Charlie Sheen who is hunting for\nthat headline exclusive. For some\nreason they only have err...two\ndays in which to resolve it all.\nSheen is second fiddle and acts\naccordingly, which reminds us that\nhe hasn't made a good film for a while. There is a more successful\nonscreen chemistry between\nTucker and Paul Sorvino, the latter\nreprising light-hearted ly his character in Coodfellas.\nTucker is the star and is actually quite funny, while the plot moves\nalong nicely with copious explosions and a good climax. It's just\nthat the film should have been\ncalled Beverly Hills Weapon 48.\nThe only surprise is that the main\nbad die is French - \"Kill z em ali\" -rather than English - \"Iam going to\nkill you now old chap!\". Not really\nworth the price of a cinema ticket,\nso wait for it to come out on video,\ncall a few mates round and with the\nmoney saved buy some Dorito's, a few dips and get the beers in.\nStef Biagini\nWin Gridlock'd on video\nCridlock'd is released by Polygram Video on 6 April, priced \u00a3 12.99. It's a refreshingly different film about drug addicts which avoids many of the\nusual stereotypes. It's about two buddies, one black (the late Tupac\nShakur) and one white (Tim Roth), but for once it's the black blok e who's the level-headed sensible guy and the white one that's the crazy ass\ndude.\nThe two are part of a jazz band along with Shakur's girlfriend. When she OD' s and ends up in a coma they decide that it's finally time to kick\nthe habit and get clean, and the film tracks the day that follows. The problem is that there's a huge obstacle in their way - bureaucracy. Forms,\nqueues and more forms conspire to prevent the two likeable leads getting\ninto rehab.\nThis is an impressive directorial debut by Vondie Curtis Hall, who has\ncreated a very individual, stylish film. Much of the sardonic script is spot-on and he combines this with some truly hilarious moments. If there is\none criticism of the film it is that it's slightly lightweight, with too many\nshots of the duo fleeing from the police rate r than developing the plot.\nHowever, it's still very enjoyable with great dialogue in places.\nFFI Beatwax have given us two copies of Cridlock'd to give away.\nTo enter, simply e mail felix@ic.ac.uk with \"Gridlock'd\" as the subject\nand we will pick the names out of the proverbial hat on Friday.\n\n"

After approaching him myself to enquire about putting on\nsome nights and it was basically\nlike talking to a brick wall, all I got\nas a response was that he had\nloads of people DJs etc of his own that put things on. And from other\npeople I have spoken to this is a common response. So why is it\nthen, that for the whole 4 years I have been here I have not seen any\ndance music nights worth going to?\nWith this location we could have\nnights that people would travel to\nattend and make this one of the\nmost happening places in London\nand show the musical depth that\nthis capital has to offer, instead of\nmore of the same old all the time. 1\nknow for a fact that we could have\nthe biggest names of dance music,\nDJs, Live PA's etc for very reasonable prices and the only thing stopping this from happening as far as I can see is Mr Home. If Iam wrong\nand there is some other reason I would love to know what it is.\nHopefully this is the beginning\nof something new in the way of\nputting nights on that represents\nwhat the people of Imperial College\nwhat to hear not what one person\nthinks everyone wants to hear.\nAN ON. UNITED COLOURS\nDear Felix,\nMr Darshan Arun wrote last\nweek (Felix 1111) 'Iam Indian and\nlike many of my black/brown\nfriends, I'm into black music'. May I suggest he definitely wants to get\nout a bit more if he hasn't yet met\nany white / yellow (whatever) people who also listen to 'soul, swing,\nhip hop etc'.\nReally, is there a need to bring\nwhat colour someone is, into what\nmusic they like?\nYours,\nElaine Kellow. BC III.\nLET THEM FIGHT\nLet's face it; C&.G and RCS have\nhad troubles recently. One key\nproblem is lack of interest from the\ngeneral student population. In\ntimes like this, we need to create\nan enemy for us to rally against,\nand the solution is obvious; each\nother. In short, RCS and C&C need\nto get at each other. The method\n(at least to start with) is clear; mas-cots. The stealing of another CC U's mascot always created a spirit\namongst the students that leads to\na decent group identity, and this\nwill be the first step in reviving the\nCC Us. The only problem is that\nC&.G are a bunch of cowards, afraid\nto make their mascots violate.\nCome on then, you bunch of girls,\nlet's sort the men from the boys,\netc. etc.\nJ Browning\nPhysics 1.\nMY FAULT\nDear Lads,\nI would just like to take the\nopportunity of putting everyone's mind's at rest.\nMy name is Filtrum, I suppose\nyou could call me a hockey player.\nI would like to lift any blame off my\ncompatriot, Lager lager.

IC NOT SO HOT\nDear Felix\nIt appears that there is a com mon misconception floating\naround Imperial. In Felix this week\n[issue 1111, March13] Simon Baker writes in his column that\nImperial College is one of the leading universities in Britain. Have you\nspotted the problem yet? Many people at Imperial make the same\nmistake as Mr Baker: in a recent\nedition of Felix a letter from the\nSummer Ball Committee claimed\nthat Imperial is one of Britain's most prestigious universities. You\nmust have spotted the problem by\nnow! Yes, contrary to popular\nbelief. Imperial College is actually a college NOT a university! I realise\nthat this comes as a huge shock to\nsome people but think about it for\na moment. Imperial is actually a constituent college of the\nUniversity of London. This explains\nwhy Imperial doesn't have the ability to award degrees: look closely\nand you will see that your degree\ncertificates are actually awarded by\nthe University of London. When you have the pleasure of attending\nthat well known event in the Albert\nHall wearing your robes you are\nattending a commemoration day\nNOT a graduation day. You are not\nbeing presented with a degree but\nan associate ship of your constituent college.\nI realise that to many people\nthis may seem incredibly pedantic\nbut actually it's quite important.\nThe powers that be at Imperial\nobviously want to become a university in their own right and this probably accounts for their policy of\nexpanding and incorporating other\ncolleges (Wye being a topical\nexample) since they probably think\nthat the bigger they are the more\nlikely they are to succeed in\nbecoming a university, or Great\nImperial World Legacy to quote\nyour editorial. So in future when\nyou're feeling a bit down about the\nfact that Imperial has just taken\ncontrol of something else, maybe\nthe profits of a travel shop or a small island nation somewhere in\nthe Pacific, remind yourself that\nImperial College is exactly what it's called: the biggest prize of all (uni-vers it y status) has still not been\nachieved: yet!\nRichard Gillies\nMedical Student\nSt. Mary's. GLIDING\nDear Felix,\nThanks to everyone who contacted me after my last letter about\nImperial College Gliding Club. After\nthe mistake with my E mail\naddress, we have decided to\nextend our offer of a trial flight and\nICGC membership for \u00a3 2 5 to anyone who contacts us this term.\n(This also covers you for the\nSummer break). If anyone is inter-este d, please contact me on\nandrew.holmes@ic.ac.uk or come\nto our meeting on Thursday (I2 pm) in Aero room254. Thanks,\nAndy Holmes, ICGC\n\n"

    "content": "26 MUSIC 25 March 1998\nSINGLES\nA huge number if singles\ngrace this page this week.\nRead and enjoy...\nT he Warm Jets produce another\nsound single with Hurricane. If\nyou liked the last ones, then get\nthis. Solid guitar ing, singing and chorus, destined for the number 37\nposition in the charts that they\nknow so well, probably deserves\nhigher.\nThe Sun Beats Down by the High\nLlamas is a playful little number,\nthat I could imagine the Beatles\ndoing as aB side to Yellow\nSubmarine, just for a laugh. It won't get any airtime, you'll never hear\nfrom them again, but who cares,\nit's fun.\nThe Dawn of the Replicants feature next with Hogwash farm (the\ndiesel hands e.p) which is quite\ncatchy, but definitely not a single.\nThere's some nice guitar ing tunes\nand backing singing, but a patchy\nchorus.He often repeats 'nothing\nmore than Hogwash' and the only\nexplanation for the lyrics of this\nsong is nothing more than hash.\nAlabama 3's Ain't Going to Coa is\na re-release or something like that\nand not a bad one. It is very easy to listen to, with a lot going on throughout the song, a mouth organ solo and a very poppy beat.A strange Reverend-like s peach in the\nmiddle about some ass, but overall\nthe sound is good. David HY ou'll like Tina Moore's Nobody\nBetter if you liked Never Gonna\nLet You Go - they're almost ident i cal. Same bass, same skipping\nbeat. Don't bother with this if\nyou've got her first and if you haven't, well, don't bother with this\neither. Let's have a bit of variation\nnext time Ms Moore. Cartoon carry on the trend for\nNASA publicity with Men from\nMars. Soundng like a more mature\nversion of the pre pubescent Crash,\nthis is definitely worth a look, if not\njust for the cool cover.\nLynden David Hall is always soul-ful, slow and sexy and doesn't disappoint on Do I Qualify. Either you\nlike this type of thing or you don't. So do what you please.\nDerek\nA band called The Smiles? Oh yeah, 1 guess these guys are\nsmiling in the same way that\nMorissey is beaming from ear to\near. The weird vocals on Say\nSomething do the impossible by\nsounding like both Roy Orbison and\nBruce Springsteen whilst still stay-I he news in j> km romo of fr his is> u;i posed so be Stjthin / Yin viii/.': J \u2022 , !\n: '\u2022\u2022 .. \" '\nf:]v \u2022 \u2022'\u2022>\u2022;\u2022 \u2022 >f' \u2022\n\u2022'\nAstral Dominoes is sparse, dance y trance y stuff from The Chemical\npilot which isn't much different to the rest of this type of thing and is\nhardly a prime example of the subtle combination of different\nbeats/sounds/etc.\nMoke's Wheel Is Motion isn't bad but not really good with nothing in\nthe punchy riff to distinguish it.\nVaguely reminiscent of a more indie\nReef, it sounds as if they had one good idea and decided to use it\nuntil it died a horrible, messy death.\nMartin\nAudio web's Policeman Skank...\n(The Story of My Life) is an\nanti-establishment number with the\nvideo shot in a police line up room. Not as frenetically frantic as\nBankrobber was but definitely in the\nsame vein as before. Heavy Jamaican accent, solid bassline and\na climactic ending to the rising\nparanoia.\nESSENTIAL CHOON Robbie Williams\nLet Me Entertain You\nThe bad boy from Take That has-n't done too badly for himself and\nthough this isn't quite as strong\nas the previous singles it certainly\nain't bad. He can't half sing\neither.\nMartin\n' \u2022\n'\n,\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022:\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022!\u2022!\u2022\u2022 :\n' \u2022'\u2022\u2022-('\u2022 'i'i: r';.:.'''! \u2022 \u2022 ::\\F'k t liv\"\"!<? \u2022\u2022 '\n' *'i'v..?

Spoken, rather\nthan sung, in monotone over basic\nstrings and beats. Definitely would\nnot be out of place in Trainspotting.\nEverything Goes Around The Wafer for The Delgados. Deconstructed\nindie patched back together with\nstrings, flutes, and boost in melody.\nUnfortunately the singers tend to\nwhine rather than rock, sounding more like the Scandinavian variety\nof indie pop. Another band that is jumping on the Black Grape / Fun loving\nCriminals band wagon is Junkie XL.\nSaturday Teenage Kicks is tedious\nrap with a dull dance track that\ndoes absolutely nothing for me. One of the B sides, 100, is a instrumental dance/trip hop track that\nshows Junkie XL's full potential.\nHow's It Going To Be is a song\nabout love and breaking up of a relationship courtesy of Third Eye\nBlind. It's as heart wrenching as\ning defiantly indie.\nLaughing Stock is lo-speed, lo-fi\nfrom Grandaddy, the Californians\nwhose dictum for band entry is\nsporting an Abraham Lincoln beard.\nThis track, like others they've made\nis equally at home being a relaxing\ntune to chill-out to, or a mosher's delight.\nSick And Beautiful is a joy to listen\nto. Artificial Joy Club's female\nvocals are - as the song suggests -both sick and beautiful, featuring\nthe wonderful cry of T need a quick\nfix.' The sick/beautiful theme means that on one listen you feel\nhappy but on another you're left\nfeeling downcast. Strange but\namazing nonetheless.\nEd\nT here is very strong songwriting\non L/7<e You from the tortured\nsoul of Kristin Hersh. Melancholic\nis the word but not to overkill sta-tus. Nicely acoustic but isn't exactly 'pop'.\nDiwifr has a very strange opening.\nMelys produce some scary xylophone noises and a haunting\nfemale voice. It reminds you of\nPortishead a bit. The rest of the\ntrack sounds like a Welsh Bjork\nsinging over a Wannadies track.\nWhether this is a good or bad thing\nis for you to decide.\nMonkey Dead by Sunhouse is from\nthe forthcoming soundtrack of\nTwenty Four Seven, a film where\nBob Hoskins trains a bunch of no-hope rs to box and in the process\ninspire them to make something of\nthemselves. Monkey Dead is probably the track where Bob wanders\ndown a lonely street doing a bit of\nsoul-searching and faith question-ing. An atmospheric acoustic blues\nnumber that is both contemplative\nand ultimately uplifting.\nDennis\nthe guitars on it. The single does\ncontain the pop hit Semi-Charmed\nLife .though. Not that that makes it\nany better.\nYou are bound to have already\nheard Ian Brown's Corpses, the\nheavily play listed follow up to My\nStar. It's moody, soulful and excel-lent. C] Ramzi\n\n"

Furthermore, university administrators are prepared to\nreduce next year's fees to encourage their Indonesian, Malaysian,\nKorean and Thai students to return.\n1 trust that Mr Heeps &. colleagues are ploughing their full\nefforts into urging Imperial College\nto introduce a similarly imaginative\nprogramme. Imperial College is\nrich with diverse cultures from all\nover the globe and it would be a shame if this world-leading university were to show itself unresponsive to a situation facing so many\nof its finest students.\nYours faithfully,\nMalcolm John\nARTSOC FIGHT\nBACK\nDear Felix,\nOn Tuesday 1 I7 March, the\nUnion Finance Committee met to decide upon club and society budgets for the forthcoming year. All\nC CU and CSC society budgets were\ndecided in this one evening alone.\nAs current Arts Appreciation chair-person, Iam writing to express my concerns as to the fairness and justification of the decisions that were\nreached.\nIt was decided that the Artsoc\nsubsidy budget for next year should\nbe reduced from the submitted\ntotal of approximately \u00a3 1300 to\nzero. Grounds for this slash in budget were based on general cutting\nback in the Union, but in particular\nto redirect money for the IC Boat\nClub, who wish to purchase another boat. I accept the need for evaluating budgets carefully, and reassigning funds if necessary.\nHowever, 1 find the shocking and\ncompletely unexpected news of\ncomplete removal of Artsoc subsidy unfair and un merited, for reasons which I will briefly explain.\nArtsoc uses the Union subsidy\nto make the Arts more affordable\nto the average student. In part icu lar, ballet, opera and large musicals\nare well beyond the price-range of\nmany students, and by wisely sub-sidi sing certain of these trips,\nArtsoc has enabled over 2 2 0 members to appreciate the cultural\nevents that they would otherwise\nbe unable to see, and to meet like-minded students who are interested in the Arts.\nWhat I find most worrying is\nthe fact that this drastic decision\nwas made very quickly, and without informing either the Artsoc\ntreasurer or myself, who could\nhave attended the UFC meeting\nand explained the situation from\nArtsoc's point of view. At the very\nleast, I believe that Artsoc should\nhave had the opportunity to discuss the problems facing the finance committee BEFORE a vote\nwas taken to remove our subsidy.\nSurely this present system is unfair,\nand leaves critical decisions in the\nhands of a committee who are\nunlikely to know about the organisation and operation of the majority of clubs.\nIt is also rather concerning that\nthe UFC did not appear to take into\naccount that Artsoc is the largest\nnon-overseas society in the union,\nand the interests of its 2 2 0 members were not considered. I find it\nunbelievable now to discover that\nwe have a budget less than most\nsocieties of similar nature who have an overall membership not\neven a quarter of that of Artsoc.\nIt was suggested in the UFC meeting that Artsoc merely pays\nfor students to enjoy themselves\non theatre trips. It is true that the\nArts are enjoyable, and members\nenjoy being a part of Artsoc. Surely\nthis is the case for other societies\nIam sure the rowers of IC, ten pin\nbowlers and parachutists, to name\nrandom clubs, also enjoy their club\nactivities! The Artsoc constitution\nclearly states that the aims and objectives of the society are to promote the appreciation of the Arts\nby organising group trips, but also\nto make the Arts more accessible\nto students by sub sidi sing such\ntrips. Artsoc have adhered to the\nconstitution, and I feel that this\nsudden reduction in funding is both\nunfair and has not been warranted.\nIf the Arts in particular are\nbeing targeted as \"unnecessary\" or\nof inferior importance to sporting\nclubs within IC, then Iam honestly\nquite disgusted. It is a great shame\nthat 2 2 0 keen and enthusiastic stu-dents, interested in having a well-rounded education by the inclusion\nof culture into their heavy scientific\nworkloads, should be taken to be\nless worthy than other clubs.\nYours faithfully,\nAngela Parkin, Chem Eng 2\nArtsoc chairperson\ne mail: a. parkin@ic.ac.uk\nDear Felix,\nThe Union have had to cut\nfunding for next session therefore\nsome societies have had their sub-su dies reduced. This is understandable but when the it is completely wiped out this is un accept able. The subsidy for Artsoc. has\nfallen from \u00a3 1 2 0 0 to \u00a3 0 , this is an\noutrage. What the union have practically done is obliterate a very succesful l society which boasts around\n230 members. Their pathetic reason was that Artsoc pay for people\nto go to the theatre and have a good time, and therefore subsidies\non these activites are unjustified.\nIsn't that the aim of most clubs, for\npoeple togo out and enjoy them-selves? I'm sure poeple in other\nclubs enjoy themselves and the\nclubs they participate in offer the\nop pur t unity to do something interesting and open their minds to new\nareas. This is exactly what Artsoc\ndoes; gives students the op pur t unity to sample the culture in\nLondon. It provides a service by\nencouraging Art in all shapes and\nforms giving students a rounded\neducation. All this crap about\nunjustified subsidies is unjustified.\nIf they have to cut subsidies o.k but\naxing the whole budget is ludicrous. I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding and it is only a matter\nof time before you( union) retract\nyour stupid shortsighted proposal\nand give us our subsidy back.\nThank you very much. SAVE ARTS OC. Mark J Chem. Eng. I( Artsoc supporter)\nNOTHING TO\nDANCE TO\nDear all.\nIam writing in response to Darshan Arun letter from last week,\nwhich was complaining about the\nlack of general dance music nights,\nespecially in specialist areas. I agree with Darshan totally there\nshould be more events like Tha\nBomb and The Electric Cafe and respect to Milan and Alick Sethi for\nactually being able to put these\nnights on, as I know how hard it is\n\n"

You might want to be\ncareful and moderate some of\nthe rules. Those marked * are\nonly for the brave!\nThe Rules\nft- Firstly, decide how much1 unit\nwill be - for example a sip of beer.\nMajor drinking penalties are indicated by \\ About 10 units or\nfinishing your current drink will suffice for this.\nft- Each player picks a driver\n* alternatively, choose more than\nA Formula1 drinking game from Mark Baker one each.\n* or randomly assign drivers so\nthat there's an equal chance of\nbeing stuck with Panis or\nSchumacher.\nft- At the start of the race, drink for\nthe duration of:\n* the time between all lights lit and\ngoing out.\n* * the time between lights starting\nto light and going out.\n* * * the whole of the parade lap.\nIf any of your chosen drivers:\nft' ...is mentioned by a commentator - drink 1 unit,\nft' ...takes a pit stop - 3 units,\nft' ...takes a pit stop for longer\nthan 10 seconds6 units.\nAlternatively, drink for the duration\nof the pit stop*. ft' ...crashes, has engine failure or\nretires - You might want to\npick another driver*.\nft- If the driver then has a tantrum,\ndrink another 6 units.\nIf your drivers:\nft- wave or make 'hand signals' to\nother drivers or officials - 3 units,\nft' are overtaken or overtakes - 2\nunits.\nft- are lapped - 3 units.\nft' are given a stop/go penalty -or drink for its duration*.\nP\" finishes in the points (top 6) -drink twice as many units as points\nscored.\nIf there are obvious team orders at\nany point (e.g. pulling over and letting team-mate by) - drink 6 units.\nIf Murray says \"and he must win\nnow\" or equivalent doom-tempting\ncomment G~. Penalties for everyone:\nft- Murray Walker gets something\nwrong drink 2 units,\nft' Brundle / co-commentator corrects him - drink 2 units more,\nft' ...in a sarcastic manner - drink 2\nunits once more.\nIf the race is re-started - $7 , ;\n.\nIf a commentator says anything\ndod gy e.g. \"he's coming up fast\nbehind him!\" drink 1 unit.\nIf anyone playing the game then\nrepeats the comment drink an\nextra unit.\nA final word of warning: remember\nthat the race lasts for two hours!\nThe\ntraditional\ngame\nThis is a traditional \"Formula 1\"\ndrinking game. If you get bored\nwith my game, give this a try.\nAlcoholics may wish to play both\ngames at once.\n1. Arrange the players around a table or in a line.\nBrake!\nIJ2. To reverse direction of play, go\n'eeee e rk!'( brakes!!) and make arm\nmovement as in diagram\n3. To pass play to left, go 'v roo om' and move arm to left.\n4. To pass play to right, go'v roo om' and move arm to right.\nV room!5. If you yell 'Aryton Senna' everyone has to go ' boo om l' and wave\ntheir arms about.\n6. If you yell 'Gear change' everyone stands, changes gear (imagine\na gear box in front of you - use\nyour arm) and takes a drink. The\nz* Change gear...\nnext person carries on the game.\nAny infringement of the rules leads\nto drinking!\n\n"

It's a strategy\ngame that uses resource management to build bases and wipe the\nenemy off the map so yes. But\ndefinitely no when it comes to the\ngameplay and graphics. Insteadof\nthe standard view from above,\nyou walk and fight on the frontline\nwhile you order in AI allied units to\nsupport, attack, defend and build.\nJust ignore the pseudo story about\na1960's hot war and it sounds a winner.\nRunning on a low end PC\n(PI20) it looks nothing special,\nthe polygons are quick, though\nplain; it plays well and gets addictive quite quickly - so don't start\nunless you have several hours\nspare. Taking it to aP200 with a decent (but not state of the art)\ngraphics card and it just looks\nso ooo good. The vehicles have\npolygon textures - The US 50's style nose paint and the USSR big\nred stars, and sprint about the\nscreen (and this isn't even with 3-D acceleration). The audio side is\nfairly standard with radio instructions and some gun noise being\nthe extent of play in this 90%\ncomplete version. The gameplay\nthough is just excellent - with both\nsingle and now universal multi play network options. But it is the idea\nthat you can and should lead your\nforces into battles being the\nsponge, creamy interior and icing\non the gameplay sponge cake.\nYou can swap between vehicles\nduring a battle, bail out and snipe\nat the enemy pilots, capture\nenemy vehicles. If they just tweak\nthe sound for the final release it is\ngoing to be big.\nGary Smith\nMYTHS : THE\nFALLEN LORDS\nPC\nReal time strategy games are\neverywhere. On the PC and Playstation owners have lost whole\ndays and nights battling using an\nenemy using tanks, dragons and\neven the odd psychopathic female\ncommando. But a new generation of real\ntime strategy games is about to hit\nthe shore. These use a true 3-D representation of the battlefield\nrather than the pseudo 3-D views.\nIn the vanguard for the fantasy\nbased games is Myths. Your view\nof the battlefield can be zoomed, panned and rotated, but only as far\nas you have explored with your\ntroops. The graphics are impressive even on a basic PI 20, with\nblood and bits of body soon littering the countryside and towns. The\nCOMPETITION41 audio effects are pretty\nmuch what you would expect with background\nbird twittering, speech and bang-ing, along with a vocal message\nevery time a brave warrior gets\nhacked or blown up.\nIts the gameplay that courts\nand while it is addictive, it can get\nvery frustrating. Without the ability\nto build more units the game rapidly becomes one of trying to\nforce a winning position tactically\nrather than strategically. Sacrificing\nunits becomes much more risky\nwith the loss of individuals rapidly\nturning fatal for the skirmish (con-s tant restoring of saved positions\nbeing the norm). The method of\nselecting differing battle groups is\ntoo slow, once a melee starts trying to complete an ordered retreat\nbecomes very difficult and costly.\nThis aside it is a better than average game and will keep the\nelectricity companies happy until\nthe release of C&.C2. Gary Smith\nWe're proud to announce that as part of our Easter giveaway special\nyou can win copies of the excellent PlayStation sports games Chill or\nWorld League Soccer, (see facing page for previews). The lovely fluffy\nbunnies at Edios Interactive have given us two copies of each game to give away to you lucky readers!\nTo win, simply write your name, department and email address on a slip of paper and drop it into the Felix office, or email felix@ic.ac.uk.

Look out\nfor a forthcoming feature on the label soon. Until then we have this\nalbum to listen to. This is the first in\na series of albums to show us that\nLaurent Gamier is not the only\nFrench D| that we should be listening to!\nJerome Pacman originates from\nthe capital of France. We normally\na soci ate our French cousins with\neverything that is artistic, smooth and passionate. This mix is a testament to that french \"Je ne sais\nquoi\" that makes them so amour ess and romantic in our eyes. Fourteen tracks that don't actually originate from France have\nbeen blended and crafted in Jerome's own unique style. Most people ask the question, \"DJing, art\nor arse?\". Here's a DJ who' s truly\nputting the art back into club cul-ture.\nThis CD has rarely left my player over the last two weeks. It has\neverything; funk, pasion, plenty of\nsex appeal, depth and a real\ngroove. The music chosen from\nJerome follows a strictly house y flavour. But we're not talking about\nyour local Ritzy Club house. This is\ncutting-edge music from some of\nthe best producers that exist in the\nscene today. You won't find endless breakdowns and \" Ooo oh! Take\nme higher!\" vocals. Quite frankly,\nthere's enough of that about today.\nWe're talking about music that is as\ncomfortable in your CD player at\nhome, as in any super club. Personally speaking, any music that\ncan work in different environments\nis music that has been produced\nfrom the heart and is driven by pas-sion, not economics.\nWe begin with a recent track\nfrom the man of the moment, Kevin Yost. His work on the USA label i! records is highly collectable.\nThe piece included on French\nSessions is a beautifully produced\npiece of slick early-morning\nhouse/jazz. Check out the sax a phone solo. We follow straight into\na minimal yet rhythmic track from\nthe Glasgow Underground collective. Bongo drums skirt in and out\nof a funky bass guitar riff. Glasgow\nUnderground are not the most consistent musical outlet at the moment, but I have to say that this\nhas real soul.\nThe mix soon moves on and gets more funky. The last few years\nhave seen house music turn back to\nthe old days of disco for in spira tion. This \"disco-house\" phenomena has seen artists such as Johnny\nFiasco, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr.\nand Gene Farris. This album contains work from possibly the most\nfamous disco-gro over of them all,\nDJ Sneak. Sneak has become a modern-day house legend. As a DJ\nor producer his work is unmistakable and essential. You can listen to \"Wanna Sing\". The disco groove is\nmaintained with fine tracks from\nRick Wade( Player's Theme) and Mike Huckaby (Groove Box).\nfej s sf vi.'ii ly yy A e\"[.e?!>;; i.y ji yy,/> n, v;e. \u2022 .:.;rj\u2022--,\u201e: t'y Aeel : y'yyy y.y or y:',:.i; J!!;']:;': \u2022 '. i iAeA re.

The trip continues\nwith some quirky music that falls\nsomewhere in the grey area\nbetween house and techno. The\nexcellent Maas from Scotland's Soma Records outs in an appearance with his track Another Saturday Night. Soma have been\nproducing funky electronic music\nthat defies the relentless pigeonholing of recent times for many\nyears and Maas is one of their star\nsignings. Paris Angeles gets a credit with a track called Hardgroove, a track that really pushes things to an\nextreme. I had never come across\nParis' work previously, but this\ntrack serves as an excellent taster\nfor a talented artist.This review has\ncovered a fraction of the fourteen\ntracks on offer here. The main thing\nto take note of is that the DJ keeps\ncontrol of his records throughout\n\u2022.:;, ''A'.'':; \"ii'ie.A\"',\" A<.:'.v.\" V:!i:'..' \u2022 i; \u2022\n:\n:; i\\ ey \u2022\\ hi Ae.e.e:''\"ee i ee ;-. yr,i.:y'::\": '\u2022\u2022'\u2022:': A, e'A:, \u2022,':,\u2022>>' e'e' A''\"''.'! i:i. in keo eA ne,e'::, eA eee.'.AA w^:: ee \u2022 \u2022 ,-A:,:' i: ii.'.

In the age of\nmega-star DJs acting as little more\nthan publicity and promotional vehicles for a handfull of tracks\nfrom big independant labels, it's refreshing to see a mix of tracks\nfrom the underdog, the small-time\nproducer who thinks big musically,\nnot financially.\nLet's not forget, that the star of\nthis album is Jerome himself. His\nmixing is smooth and controlled.\nHis flair and passion for his art is\nevident. His love of the tracks he\nchooses and combines is obvious.\nLong gone are the days when French music was laughed at and\nridiculed. St Germain, Daft Punk,\nEtienne de Crecy and Air have led a new French revolution. Now DJs\nlike Jerome Pacman are teaching us\nhow to play the house music we love. Vive La France; Vive La\nMusique; Vive La House! ai.ck\n\n"

Having conceded Our BUS A cup place and the UL cup to the scum and been called\nthe underdogs by the match pro-gram, it was time for revenge.\nThe long match preparation started\nwith a relaxing stroll through the\ntrees, a warm up in some random\ncul-de-sac and some wise words in\nthe dressing room. Then the game started. Within ten\nminutes and two short corners we\nfound ourselves 2-0 down. We continued to dominate the match,\nenjoying virtually all the possession\nand with about ten minutes to go in\nthe first half, legendary skipper\nChicken Bol skipped past his marker and placed the ball onto the\nFluffy Cherub's stick who neatly\nguided the ball into Sid the Sexist's path for him to place the ball into\nthe RH UL net. 2-1.\nAfter some inspirational half-time\ndeliberations, our hopes were\nquickly dented by another RH UL short corner goal. Then, as fitness\nand availability of substitutes\nbecame a factor, our domination\nbecame awesome. Sid narrowed\nthe deficit to one goal and with two\nminutes remaining, equalise d amongst scenes of euphoria when\nthe vastly outnumbered IC crowd\nmore than matched the RH UL gathering for noise.\nExtra time was thus necessary and\nwith the RH UL players standing on\ntheir last legs, half the team should\nhave had hat-tricks, but all decided\nthat penalties were a crueler end\nfor the Holloway boys.\nAnd so penalties were necessary.\nWith Big t it ties, Sid and Noddy all\nscoring convincingly and Red\nHelmet saving or out nerving the\nholloway players, we won convincingly 3-1.\nMuch alcohol was consumed, many songs were sung and we\nwent to Southside to celebrate\napparently.\nI'd like to thank all the players for a brilliant season and my brother for\nplaying like shit.\nICUHC 1 3 - 3 RHUL I IC win 3 - 1 on penalties.\nICUHC I Celebrate their victorious cup performance.\nMore Guns? Not Half!\nLast Saturday, members of ICRPC\nventured on to the frozen wastes\nof Bisley to shoot for the Courtman\nshield. This is an inter-CCU full\nbore rifle competition shot at 300\nyards The teams' members ran the\nwhole gamut of experiences from\nold sweats to those who had never\nshot full bore before.\nScores were erratic due to the\nstrong and changeable winds blowing that day. Nevertheless some\nimpressive scores were recorded\nand the day was most successful.\nFinal scores were close but C&.G were adjudged to be the victors,\nlargely due to their superior numbers. Thanks to Andrew for his selfless coaching and also to all those\nwho proved themselves well skilled\nat the art of butt marking. Ooh Matron! This weekend saw the BUS A rifle\nmatch held in the earthly paradise\nthat is Sutton Coldfield. The university of London fielded a team of\neight, six of which hailed from\nImperial.\nMany of the UL team achieved\nimpressive scores, particularly\nAndrew ' Wildman' Eldridge, who was let in the team despite having\nspread slanderous rumours about\ncaptain Gareth.\nThough tipped as favourites, the\nUL team only managed second,\nwith Edinburgh taking first place.\nThis was due mostly to one of the\nnon-Imperial members shooting\nlike an arse.\nThe English University men's team\n(two of whom were IC shooters)\ndrew1156 ex 1200 with the\nScottish universities and the\nEnglish Universities women beat\nthe Scots.\nImperial scores (ex 200)\nRachael Ambrose - 191\nAndrew Eldridge - 195\nGareth Hillier - 193\nPhil Golds - 191\nAndy Forsyth - 183\nMike Eustace - 190\nAnd More\nGuns\nThe Imperial College Rifle and\nPistol Club Ladies Team recently\nput in a sterling performance\nagainst the RS M Rifle Team. In this\ntight fought competition our team\ndid us proud despite Neela, it's foremost member having inadequate clavicle-scapula r in vagina tion (I'm assured this is not what\nyou might suspect - Ed). The\nwomen' steam saw Impressive\nperformances by both Sascha\nKlengel and Rickitina Anglerud, our\nSwedish Blonde who's consistent\nperformances have placed her at\n2nd in the ICRPC Duelling Ladder.\nEventually RS M claimed the\nlead thanks to boy wonder Nick\nRoyall who overcame his youth\nand inexperience to put in a great\nperformance that makes us believe\nthat he could grow up to be a very\nuseful shot.\nWe'd like to thank all those\nwho participated and wish The fair\nSimone Parton good luck with her\nnew diet program.\nFinal score\nICURPC Ladies 1173 - 1189 RSM.\nFace Uphill\nStruggle\nThe first competition to ever be\nattended by the Mountaineering\nClub and after keeping the opposition awake half the night with a didgeridoo we felt our chances\nwere good. On arriving, after a mammoth tour of Sheffield, the\nteams chose their routes and settled down. The first time period\nstarted only too quickly with Ruth\nand Nick getting off to a cracking\nstart, Ruth scoring a magnificent\n1 14 points giving her a fantastic\n13th overall position.\nThe next session saw Daffy\nand Mike putting in sterling performances, bagging 115 and 121\npoints respectively. The final session saw Rich and Simon pitched\nagainst some hardcore opposition\nfrom the other university squads.\nBoth did exceptionally well getting\n136 and 140 points respectively,\nputting the 1st team into 21st position out of 45.

    "content": "RUB38 LOADS OF CULTURED STUFF! ANTIGONE\nRiverside Studios\nCorruption of power, the\nrights of the Gods over the\nrights of men, the pride of a father, the devotion of a family.\nThese are some of the many issues\nthat are dealt with in Forbidden\nTheatre's innovative and thought\nprovoking production of AntigoneSophocles' Greek tragedy about\nlove, death, revenge and honour.\nThe chorus scenes were performed\nin the physical theatre style that is\nfast becoming Forbidden's trade\nmark. The cast worked together\nvery well as a group and put a lot of\nenergy into these scenes. It is such\na pity then that these scenes never\nfully realised the full potential of\nthe ideas. When the choreography\nserved to enhance and add depth\nto the text, it worked well and\nthere was some effective imagery.\nAt other times, however, I was at a loss to determine the function of\nsome of the movements.\nThere was a good contrast\nbetween these highly visual scenes\nand the more conventional style of\nthe scenes between the characters,\nARTS 25 March 1998\nwhich preserved the distant nature\nof the chorus. The transition\nbetween the two styles though\nlacked a certain fluidity. My own favourite scene was the impassioned argument between the king\nand his son. The actors created a bond of sympathy between the\ncharacters and the audience leading to perhaps the most dramatic\npart of the play. This effect was\nonly marginally detracted from by\nthe fact that the staging meant it\nwas impossible to watch them both\nat the same time.\nWhilst Forbidden should be\ncomplimented for having the\ncourage to attempt to perform the\nplay in this way, the lack of polish\nresulted in a performance that\nnever quite fulfilled its promise.\nTom\nBONNARD AT THE TATE\nTate Gallery\nPainting is a series of patches\nthat ]o in together to form\nthe object, the fragment\nover which the eye can t rave out interruption.\"\nA central event of th j l cultural calendar, the Tatft'\nhosts the fi is i com pre hens l xt Pierre Bonnard( l867l9475 ret J Hsp ect ive since 190\u00a7n ric liJ ding over\na hundred oil paintings, \u2022 \u2022 kf j fi jk and watercolours is suf l BmJ H worldwide museums aid private\ncollections, this extensive exhibition traces the artistic evolution of\nthe French post-impressionist mas-ter.

It follows the\nlives of a very close knit Jewish\ncommunity in pre-Revolutionary\nRussia. The story concerns the\nloves, trials, and tribulations of\npeople who are eventually forced\nto move away from their humble\ndwellings by the corrupt Russian\npolice. The plot reflects the views\nof a bigoted Russian government.\nThe company of performers,\nunder the direction of Kirsty\nBennett and Stephen Brown, were\nof an extremely high standard.\nBoth principal and chorus roles\nwere played with energy and\nenthusiasm, and all involved are to\nbe highly congratulated. It is certainly one of the better amateur\nperformances I have seen in recent\nyears.\nVicky S. THE LOCAL\nStandpoint Gallery\nM an walks into a pub. Goes\nover to the fag machine\nfor 20 Marlboro Lights.\nThere is no fag machine. Decides\nto s paz five quid on a fruit machine\ninstead. There are no fruit\nmachines. Sod it. He'll calm himself\ndown with a bottle of Pils. There is\nno Pils. There are no drinks at all.\nNo bar staff. No bar.\nIn fact, it's not a pub - it's an art\ngallery, the Standpoint Gallery to\nbe exact, and I 've stumbled into an\nexhibition called 'The Local'.\nOstensibly, 'The Local' tackles the\ngreat British institution of The Pub.\nWhat actually happens is that 'The\nLocal' puts a pint of lager on the\ntable and then drops a piano on\nthe head of anyone who tries to\ndrink it. The theme of 'The Pub' acts\nas a conceptual beachhead,\ndesigned to melt into the wings\nand allow deeply personal themes\nto take centre-stage once the\npunter is hooked. Not fair? Who said that getting punters to \"engage\nbrain when entering gallery\" was\ngoing to be fair? Three artists are\nshowing: Richard Elliot, Stephen\nPerkin and Sophie Newell. Their\nwork is both complementary and\nsyne r gic, and an awesome sense of\nspace flows throughout the ex hi bi tion.\nRichard Elliot confronts us with\na seemingly mundane blown-up\nphotograph of an ashtray, taken\nusing a tiny depth of field so that\nthe bright lights of the bar in the\nbackground are blurred, distant,\nmoving away. The separation of\nthe ashtray from its surroundings is\njarring, and forces us to confront\nwhat we feel about the object's space, the space where we think it\nwas, the space where we think it is,\nthe space it took with it on its journey from pub to photograph in a gallery. We are made to feel that\nwe need to fill in the gaps, to imagine what might have been, and\nElliot's photographs emphasise this\nby their absence of people. He\nmakes people more interesting by\nnot showing them to us, giving us\ninstead their space-prints, their\nvapour-trails.\nSophie Newell has installed a small room in the gallery. There are\nno obvious clues that the room\ncomes from a pub. Instead, it suggests a set of deeply embedded associations: the dark polyester\ncarpet says it's had Doberman shit\nsponged out of it once or twice;\nthe garish turquoise lighting says\nit's probably seen the odd feverish\ngrope; the embossed burgundy\nwallpaper can't repeat what it's heard. Newell is creating a conceptual space for us to venture into,\nand it's almost as if the installation\nexists only to tell us what is miss-ing, what we need to fill in our-selves. Yet again, we get that familiar jarring sensation that comes-from seeing an object so far out of\ncontext, having to confront what it\nreally means to us for the first time.\nThe themes of jarred contexts\nand empty spaces run right\nthrough 'The Local'. It is a relatively\nsmall exhibition, but what it lacks in\nquantity it easily makes up for in\nstrength of purpose. It is a deeply\npersonal experience and it makes\nan ideal starting point for novice art\nconnoisseurs and confused punters alike. A word of warning,\nthough. Take a hard hat and watch\nout for pianos.\n/on jansen\n\n"

Going by the number of\nrave reviews printed all over this,\nher second novel, 1 wound n't be\nsup rise d if it garnered her some\nmore awards.\nHard, soft and wet actually\nrefers to hardware, software and\nwetware (in other words, us, pe o ple). A ha,I bet I 've lost your interest now haven'tI? McGrath has\ntaken her own experiences and\nused them as the basis for the story\nwhich charts the voyage of discovery of \" M\" as she explores the digital age in all it's glory. As it's written\nin the first person, I assume M is\nthe author herself. She goes from a complete novice (newbie), to\nsomeone who is far more knowl-edge able, but is touched with a degree of pessimism about it all.\nHer initial guide in cyber space is\nNancy, her best friend. Nancy works in Silicon Valley as a software\nmarketer and it is down to her to\nexplain some of the con vol ved, technical jargon.\nM in her quest to understand\nwhat it's all about travels to various\nplaces such as Iceland, Moscow and America. In each new part of\nthe world she manages (with\napparent ease) to talk to the forerunners in their particular fields of\nexpertise.\nMcGrath is a talented writer.\nShe writes both fluidly and coherently and it is obvious that she's done her research. While an important part of the novel is about tech-no logy, she never falls into the trap\nof sounding like a computer manual or allows it to overshadow the\ncharacters. Anyone who reads this\nbook, especially students at\nImperial, will be able to recognise\nboth themselves and people they\nknow within it, from the techno-ph obe to the computer nerd.\nThe style, however, eventually\nbecomes a little repetitive - M discovers some increasingly technical\nphenom e nom and then jets off to\nfar flung destinations to hobnob\nwith those in the know.

Cattaca is\nthe first such movie and portrays\nthe frightening image of a future\nwhere couples choose their children from a catalogue. In a world\nwhere perfection is cherished it is\nthe ultimate gamble to conceive a child by natural means. The results\nof this genetic role of the dice are\nan underclass labelled \"in-valid s\", who are unable to compete with\ntheir stronger, healthier and more\nintelligent opponents.\nOne such in-valid is Ethan\nHawke. The second he was born a blood test revealed that he would die of a heart condition at the age\nof 29. When he fails to get a job\ndue to his imperfections he \"bor-rows\" the identity of the valid Jude\nLaw, using his body fluids to pass\nthe tests to get a job with Gattaca,\na space travel organisation. Here\nhe meets Uma Thurman and attempts to achieve his dream of\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Vi\nreaching Saturn before he dies.\nCattaca was written and directed by Andrew Niccoi and is\nclearly a very personal version of\nthe future.

Scenes are\nstretched to a point where you wish it all to end and, without\nunderstanding the director's hidden meanings, the film\nbecomes boring. This may be\nTiii< y. ja\nfilms with deep messages and symbolism. However, the rest of\nus who like our popcorn and pop films should steer well away from\nVIDEOS TO RENT One thing you can\nsafely say about David\nLynch is that he\ndoesn't make ordinary\nfilms. Lost Highway,\nstarring Bill Pullman and Patricia\nArquette, is a bizarre mix of film\ngenres that constantly takes you by\nsurprise. If you're fed up with linear\nfilms this mix of murder, mystery\nand suspense will be a memorably\ncreepy alternative. O35 SPHERE\nStarring: Dustin Hoffman, Sharon\nStone, Samuel L Jackson\nDirector: Barry Levinson\nRelease: 27 March A fantastic cast, an\nacclaimed director and the intriguing premise of\nan alien craft found at the\nbottom of the ocean floor -what more do you need for a scifi epic? Well, a decent storyline might\nhelp. Sphere is based on a Michael\nCrichton novel (which was written\nbefore The Abyss so no\naccusations of plagiarism please)\nand suffers from a surplus of\nambition. It assumes the audience\nis bored with little green men and\nso instead concentrates on the\npsychological effect of being confronted with an alien species.\nThe direction the film is going\nin is made clear in the opening\nscenes, when we see that the crew\nsent to investigate the craft is an\nunarmed collection of academics,\nincluding a psychiatrist (Hoffman),\nmathematician (Jackson) and a biochemist (Stone). Their initial\ninteraction with the ship is\nfascinating but the sense of\nmystery is lost as the audience\nrealises that no explanations will\nbe given. Rather, Levinson sticks\nrigidly to the (frankly unexciting)\nbook and the degenerating state\nof the crew's minds.\nThis is all a bit of a shame since\nthe trailers implied that Sphere is a gripping Event Horizon meets The\nAbyss affair. The reality is that it is\na psychological thriller which just\nhappens to be set near an alien\ncraft. As a result it will disappoint\nalmost everybody who sees it. D Chris Hickey\nNo room for a review of Most]\nWanted. However, it's an\nadequate action thriller with Jon\nVoight (yet again).\nLOST HIGHWAY 1 87\nSamuel L Jackson followed Pulp\nFiction and A Time To Kill with this\ndark thriller set in a Los Angeles\nschool. He gives an excellent\nperformance as a teacher whose\nvery life is threatened by the violence of the classroom. Depressing\nand bleak, this nonetheless carries\na powerful message about the\nAmerican education system. See\npage 42 for a chance to win one of\ntwo copies.\n\n"

If those are the images\nthat this musical style conjure up\nfor you then prepare for a shock.\nThink of drum' n' bass again!\nThink of all of the above. Now add some names to those lists. Think of\nGermany; think of Frankfurt,\nMannheim, Berlin, Hamburg and\nMunich. Think of Compost Records, Force and Paul, 'Into\nSomething, and Fauna Flash...\nFauna Flash! About four years\nago two Bavarians from Munich began making music together. To\nbegin with it was electronic music.\nAs their production skills increased,\nit evolved into drum'n 'bass. Fauna\nFlash soon teamed up with Michael Reinboth, the founder of the very\ninfluential Munich based label,\nCompost Records. Now we have a new album from Roland and Cristian (aka Fauna Flash) called the\nExperimental Kitchen. Look out for\nit in good record stores NOW! As if the Fauna Flash project\nwasn't enough, the boys have also\nteamed up with Rainer Truby,\nanother Compost artist who hails\nfrom Freiburg, in the Rhein Valley to\nform the Rainer Truby Trio. Rainer is\na star in the UK eclectic under-ground, with critical acclaim co ming from Giles Peterson and the\nTalkin' Loud Collective and also\nMo' Wax, etc. It is also said he has\na vast record collection of priceless\njazz and funk and fusion. Definitely\na DJ to check out next time he is at\nthe Blue Note!\nThe Rainer Truby Trio's big\nbreak came when they were asked\nto remix Plis Infinis No2 from\nFrance's Frederic Galliano (a big\nstar on the international electronic\njazz circuit) on Laurent Garnier's label F Communications. The remix\nis, in most people's opinion, the\nhighlight of the EP. Subtle Brazilian\nrhythms shuffle along dreamily, and\nthe scene is set for a great piece of\nmusic.\nI was lucky enough to meet up\nwith Roland and Cristian during a recent tour of the UK. The first\nthing I wanted to know was how\nthey could best describe their\nmusic. Since drum' n' bass has\ncrossed over to Germany, it has\ngone through some subtle changes.\n\"The main thing is\ndrum'n 'bass.\" Replies Roland, \"But\nit's a special view of drum'n 'bass;\nvery jazz-orientated, but not in the\njazz-style of, say Bukem. It's more\noriginal jazz samples and the sound\nis a little bit harder than the normal\njazz stuff.\"\nSo how did Fauna Flash come about? \"We've known each other\nfor over fifteen years.\" Continues\nRoland, \" We played as drummers\nin teenage school bands, and lived\nin the same area of Munich. We started working together in this\ntype of music three or four years\nago, because we didn't want to\nstay in the drummer's seat! We were in rock bands, jazz bands,\nfusion outfits. Everything!\"\nIt is this openness and need to\nembrace as many different types of\nmusic as possible that led to a transition from being a part of the band\nto actually being responsible\ntowards the entire musical output.\n\" We were always interested in\nrhythms and beats. That's what is\nso exciting about drum'n 'bass. But\nat the same time we were listening\nto jazz and fusion. That's the background of Fauna Flash.\"\nDuring his period as a drum-mer, Cristian was slowly getting\ninto electronic music. \"I saved up\nfor a sampler and some sequencing\nstuff and 1 was trying acoustic\ndrums with electronic percussion.\nWhen me and Roland became a collective it was because we weren't satisfied in playing just in\nbands anymore; playing other pe o ple's music. We wanted to do something alone. We didn't decide\n'now we're going to go into computers or now we're going to do drum' n' bass.' It just happened slowly but surely.\"\nOne of the first appearances\nthat Fauna Flash made together\nwas at a big techno rave with an\nentirely new concept. \"We hooked\nto play at a rave with two drum sets\nand some ambient records.\"\nExplains Cristian, \"That's what got\nus into this whole dance thing. It\nMichael Reinboth,\nfounder of\nCompst Records\nPhoto: Aliki\nwas a whole new scene for us\nbecause we were always playing in\njazz clubs or at rock concerts.\"\n\" We got invited and I would say\nthat we were open minded enough\nto try it out. So it was 'Let's go for\nit and see what happens.' We just\nwent for it! Less is more. We played simple beats together and\npeople got into it.\"\nBoth Roland and Cristian cite\ntheir musical heroes as \"Weather\nReport, Yellow Jackets, Miles Davis,\nCameo, all P Funk music, Roy Ayers\nand the 80's!\" The Rainer Truby Trio began\nafter fauna Flash was an established and respected outfit. \"We\nspent a lot of time together (with\nRainer). So we thought, because of\nthe jazz background we have, we\nwanted to have another project.\nAnother thing that wasn't just\ndrum'n 'bass. Fauna Flash is just\nheading down one alley. With\nRainer and his jazz background we\nsaid 'Let's do RTT to get this other\nmusical form out to the people.'\"\nThe UK underground, whether\nit be the jazz community or the\nd'n'b scene is seriously getting into\nthe sounds of FF and the RTT. This\nis the music that will prove whether\ndrum'n 'bass is a truly international\nart form, or a clique yUK thang!\nYou can check out Fauna Flash\nand the Rainer Truby Trio on Compost Records from Munich. al;ck\n\n"

    "content": "32 MUSIC 25 March 1998\nCLUB SCENE THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE THE UNITED COLOURS OF\nADAM FA dam F is the man behind the\nfirst underground drum &\nbass track to truly crossover into the mainstream, putting\ndrum & bass in the public eye for\nthe first time for all the right\nreasons.\nTwo years after its initial\nrelease, Circles, a massive underground anthem, was picked up by\nthe likes of Radio One and Kiss\nFM due to it's sheer quality and\noriginality, although they were\nslow on the uptake.\nWith the support of the radio\nstations, Circles hit the national\ncharts at Number 19. This showing that the true underground\ndrum &. bass tracks can easily\ncompete with more traditional\nstyles of music, if they can only\nget equal air play. People won't go\nout and buy records they have\nnever heard.\nAfter the success of Circles,\nAdam was a wanted by several\nmajor labels who had realised that\nthey could make money from drum\n&. bass. At only 25, Adam is already\none of the major players in the\nscene with a string of ground breaking tunes under his belt.\nMetropolis recorded on the\nlegionary Metal head z label\nincreased Adams' status, a tune\nwell ahead of its time with a phat\nand totally original bassline that\ntook drum &. bass in yet another\ndirection. It was one of those pivotal tracks that summed up the vibe\nof the time and will be played for\nyears to come. And who could forget Aromatherapy on Section 5\nrecords?\nAdam kindly took time out of his\nhectic schedule to talk to me about\nhis new album Colours and the\nmusic on his mind.\nJP. Other than remixes, there's only four new tracks on Colours.\nWhy is this ?\nAF. \"Well it's as much about\ngetting the stuff I have already\nreleased heard by a larger audience,\nas tracks like Metropolis you probably haven't heard unless you go out\nto the right clubs, or buy a lot of\nvinyl, so this is aimed more towards\neducating people who are not so\ninto the scene as well as releasing\nsome new material\"\nJP. The new single Music in my\nMind is another wicked track that\nis also getting a little bit of air\ntime on the major radio stations.\nDo you think it will chart ?\nAF. What ever happens, hap-pens. 1 try not to set expectations\nas you only get disappointed\n) P. If it does, would you go on\nTop of The Pops, as I know some\npeople have something against\ngoing on shows like that ?\nAF. If it seemed right at the time\nyes I would, I have had offers to go\non shows like TFI Friday and that.\nWith TV, with all the profile 8. publicity you get it's not a bad thing,\nit's all about how you present your-self, but you will not catch me on\nany kids shows or anything like that.\n|P. So we won't be seeing you\non Alive 'n' Kicking then?\nAF. No not at all\nJP. Do you feel it is a good or\nbad thing that all the big name\nproducers and Djs being signed\nup to the major labels?\nAF. Well I can't speak for other\npeople, each person has to weigh\nup the options and work out what is\nbest for themselves. 1 spoke with\nGoldie, Groovrider and a few others\nwho have already been signed to\nmajors and decided that EMI were\noffering the best deal for me. It's nice to get that security, the financial backing to do what you love\nwith out having to worry about\nmoney all the time. 1 feel it is important for me to be with a major label\nas they have the experience of promoting on a worldwide scale and\nthat's what the scene needs.\nJP. Do you still maintain full\ncontrol over your musical\ndirection ?\nAF. Yes, they have set me up\nwith my own label F Jams, which I have full control over from the artwork to musical direction every-thing, what they bring as I said\nbefore is the promotional experience. JP. Do you feel this music can\ngo the same way that rap music\nhas and build its own empire ?\nAF. well if you think about it, ten\nyears ago rap music was in the\nposition that drum &. bass is today,\nand they both started in one small\nplace and grew from there, so\nhopefully, yes.\nJP. Is there a chance of the\nmusic losing its underground\nflavour with the majors getting\ninvolved ?\nAF. No matter what happens\nthe music will always stay alive, no\nmatter how big it gets, whether\npeople want to water it down or\nwhat ever there will always be people who make music for the love of\nit not the money, if you look at hiphop music it's changed from where\nit started but still maintains flavour\nJP. Can the music maintain it's underground flavour and gain\nmass appeal?\nAF. Yes, just look at Circles. 1\ndidn't remix it or anything for the\ncharts, it was the same as the original release a few years earlier and it\ngained wide spread acclaim and\nafter getting air play it reached\nnumber 19 in the national charts, so\nthat proves that it can\"\nJP. You have been touring a lot\nthe last year what is the world\nscene like, is it picking up?\nAF. Yes, I have been to Brazil,\nJapan and America recently. Japan's on it in a big way, that's where the\nalbum sold second best after here,\nthey have got a good little scene\ngoing on over there. Brazil was\nmad, there is not much of a scene\nthere but they are a crazy party mad nation who are up for anything,\nAmericas know what is going on,\nthey have got a lot of small scenes\ndotted about over the country, the\nplace is just so big that they are all\nvery spread out, but there is a bases\nfor the scene to grow out there.\nJP. What influences your work?\nAF. Everything, I listen to every-thing, from R'n' B, soul, hip-hop to\nwhatever.\nJP. What's in your car stereo\nat the moment?\nAF. It changes every day, but at\nthe moment I 've been listen to\nGoldie's new album.\nJP. What do you think of it?\nAF. It's good to see something\nhe has been working on for so long\nto finally be finished and released, I think it's very good. JP. What our your plans for the\nrest of the year?\nMore touring, I'm back off to\nJapan soon, and concentrating on\nthe live show and on making it a better show watch.\nJP. With your shows are you\ngoing for a more live sound?\nNot live as in acoustic, the bass\nplayer for example has all keyboards and samplers round his neck\nas well as acoustic bass instruments, so he has all the different\nsounds there at his fingertips.\nThe live show is so intense, we\nhave all the different bass lines their\nso we can switch straight from one\nto another, we play with the audi-enc e.We have all live breaks 'n' synthesised sounds, mixing the\nsounds live. If you want us to drop\nin the Metropolis bass-line over say\nCircles we can, it's not like we will\nbe there on stage playing flutes and\nthings, but saying that I have tried\neverything over the last year.\nIf you fancy see the man live\nand direct, you can catch him down\nthe Astoria check club listings for\ndates.\nJo Public.\nd dd ff l* "

Here are a couple\nof examples. Prowler '97 sounds\nlike the product of a fight between\naCD and a Brillo Pad and Access\nControl is a contender for the long\nawaited soundtrack release to that\naudio-visual masterpiece Pong.\nWith some of the strangest\nsounds I 've ever heard and fart\nnoises aplenty, The Surveillance\nhas less sophistication than Bambi\non ice. You will probably have\nnever heard anything like this\nbefore, and really it would need a whole new genre created specifically for it. However, it would definitely be more suited to settle\nunder the broad banner of 'shite',\nand never to be heard again.\nJudging by the paranoia conveyed through the album and track\ntitles, security measures will not\neven let you get near this one, but\nshould this be governed by Group4, just steer well clear. d Derek\nEMMA\nTOWNSHEND\nWinterland \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAngst-ridden hippy females, aren't they great? Emma Townshend, the\ndaughter of Pete ' Who?' Townshend joins a long line of\nhigh pitched, deeply disturbed women and sounds almost indistinguishable to most of them. She\nhas a lovely voice with a range\nfrom middle C to about an octave\nabove top C, not always quite in\nthe right key, but then what's a few\nwrong notes between friends? And like |oni Mitchell, she writes and\nplays all her own stuff. On some of\nher songs, she sounds a lot like Tori\nAmos, on others Janis Joplin, Kate\nBush, and sometimes, perhaps\nalarmingly, Alanis Morissette. Don't let that put you off, though.\nThis is a fabulous album, and deserves to be bought by every-one. I really like it, but I think I might be unique in that. Grow your\nshort, boyish crop out, put some flowers in your hair and around\nyour room, buy a grand piano,\nwear long, floral pattern skirts, go barefoot, paint your toenails with\nglitter, and return to the Summer of\nLove.

After last\nterm's belly-flop, the r aggies have\nreturned if not with a bang, at least\nwith a good loud fart. Thanks to\nvarious dubious semi clothed events, they have managed to\nraise over \u00a3 2 0 0 0 for the charities\nLeukemia Research, Riding for the\nDisabled and CA G. Events kicked off on9 March with a show by the renowned hypnotist (and ex-Felix editor) Martin\nTaylor in dBs. Elvis impersonations\nand excessive tie wearing ensued,\n, but as yet, no nakedness.\nThis was soon corrected by\nthe C&.G Slave Auction. Seen by\nmany as the beginning of the\ndemise of civilisation, the event\nalso raised over \u00a3 5 0 0 . Bidding was\ninitially sluggish, with Mr Manandhar and Mr Cuomo fetching just \u00a3 5 each (although this was\n\u00a3 4 . 9 0 over the reserve). Executive\nslaved generated more interest,\nwith Katie Armstrong going for\n\u00a3 5 5 and Andy He eps bottling out\nand purchasing himself for \u00a3 1 0 0 .\nNot content with this, the audience clubbed together to raise a further \u00a3 6 0 to force him to de robe and wobble his blubber.

    "content": "30 MUSIC 25 March 1998\nCLUB SCENE CLUB REVIEW.% ULTIMATE B.A.S.E.@ The Velvet Rooms, WC1.\nI have been meaning to attend\nthis club for a very long time ,\nespecially since it's refurbishment late last year. For those of you who for some reason have not\nheard of this almost legendary club\nnight, it is on every Thursday 9 pm3 am and the occasional Saturday\ndown The End nightclub.\nIt also has every thing \"to do\nwith the big man Carl Cox who is\nresident along with Jim Masters.\nEither one or the other is always\nthere. Unluckily for me we attended\na night when Jim not Carl was in the\nCLUB SCENE COMPILATIONS place. I have nothing against Jim\nyou understand but Carl Cox has\nbeen my hero for many years now\nand I would have loved to have\nseen him in action again.\nWe arrived around midnight\nand entered probably the most\nplush surroundings in London- the\nVelvet Rooms and I can now see\nwhy it's so-called, with the walls\ncovered with red cushions and pristine red seats it just oozes class.\nThis is only a small club but it has\nplenty of seating and a crystal clear\nsound system making this the per-The House Music Movement\nMixed By DOC MARTIN (MASTER TONE) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 / 2\nT his is the first from a new\nseries The Complete History\nof House mixed and is presented by the worlds greatest DJs.\nLining up alongside LA finest (Doc\nMartin) in this series are Todd Terry\nand Roger Sanchez (New York),\nFarley Jackmaster Funk (Chicago)\nand Murk (Miami).\nAccompanying each of these\nmix CDs is an interview CD featuring some of the originators of the\nhouse movement talking with Jon\nFleming about the history of house.\nThe man behind this first offering is Doc Martin. I'm pretty sure\nmost of you won't be familiar with\nthe name, which is surprising as he\nis one of the major players on the\nworld scene. So here are a few\nthings you should know about him:\n1. Has played for 28 days straight.\n2. Has over 1,300,000 air miles.3. Only West-Coast DJ to have\nlived in NY.\n4. Has played with Dee-lite, The\nProdigy, Mody etc.\n5. Voted in top 20 DJs in the world\nby details magazine.\n6. Can hold a floor for up to 8hrs. So he has the credentials -what about the CD. As you would\nexpect the mixing is smoother than\na babies bottom and the tunes are\ntaken from the early days of house\nmusic. The set builds and progresses nicely. I remember what someone once said to me, \"your set\nshould be like your telling a story\"\nand this is a good example of it.\nThe musical styles covered are\ndeep house with occasional vocals,\ngetting harder towards the end.\nSo all in all this is a very competent mix CD nicely packaged\nwith plenty of background info on\nthe scene. And you won't find any\nchart toppers on here as is so often\nthe case, but only the real music\nbehind this musical revolution. JP\nfeet place to sit back in the most\npleasant surroundings your likely to\nfind in a club anywhere and listen to\nup-front music.\nIn case your were wondering,\nthe music policy is hard house /\ntechno &. tech-house brought to\nyou by the best in the business.\nWhen we arrived the place wasn't packed but an ample amount of\npeople were there and the music\nwasn't to hard at all, but gradually\nbuilding as the night progressed\nuntil about 1.00 when the DJ\nunleashed a fierce assault of tech-no. Just what the crowd had been\nwaiting for -first class stuff.\nThis club does not only boast\nthe best techno music you'll find\nanywhere in London especially on a Thursday but a club that has the\nnicest little touches such as air conditioning (no sweaty monsters in\nhere) and people that come round\nand collect empty bottles and\nempty the ash trays so your not\nfalling over bottles all night.\nSo full marks to club and pro-mote rs.A night that will takes a lot\nof beating. JP\nThe Sound Of The Underground\nMixed By The Lisa Marie Experience * * \u2022 1/2\nT his is the sister series being\nrun in conjunction with The\nHouse Music Movement.\nThis one showcases the leading\nnames from around the world with\nmixes to come from Norty Cotto's NY latino, DJ Alfredo's balearic\nbeats, DJ Marques Wyatt (LA) and\nPsycho Bitch &. Teri Bristol\n(Chicago), covering the underground that is 90's club culture.\nNeil Hinde and Dean Marriott\naka The Lisa Marie Experience get\nthe series underway with their own blend of up-front club cuts that\nhave helped make London one of\nthe most forward looking club cultures in the world. The musical\nstyle is underground disco/ house\nbut not quite as underground as I was expecting or hoping.\nThe Lisa Marie Experience take\nthere name from Jacko's ex-wife\nLisa Marie Presley (but don't ask\nme why). They have had wide\nspread success over the past few\nyears, not only with their remix\nwork but also with their own pro-duct ions. The peak of there success was\nthe club anthem of 96' Keep on\nJumpin' which also reached No.30 in the national charts.\nIn case you where wondering\nthe mixing is of a high standard, no\nlame uninvolved stuff here but long\nrunning tight mixes.\nThe mix is set rolling with a true\nhouse classic House is a Feelingby Sunday School and this is a good indication of the overall style\n- not the most underground selection I can think of but not a bad\none either. Again this all comes\nvery neatly packaged with plenty of\ninfo on the boys.\nAll-in-all this isn'ta bad start to\nwhat could be a comprehensive\nreview of that broad spectrum of\nmusic that is House . JP\nChOCOlate Weasel. Spaghettification ( Nlnja Rec.) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nW ith the Easter break loo ming you'll want something\nto sit back and unwind to.\nSomething to take your mind off\nthe strain of exams, coursework\nand all that shit. Chocolate Weasel's Spaghettification could\nbe just the thing.\nAmes me rising collection of\nsample based beats ranging from\nslow moody tracks too more\nupbeat high paced numbers bordering on the realms of D&B. I love\nthe heavy electro influences running through many of these tracks\nwith that monosyllabic space bass\nthat T Power has made his own. T Power says that \"we were\ntrying to keep that simply bedroom\nstudio style\" And they have succeeded in doing just that, taking a look back at the roots mixed with\nupfront beats. Those of you who have heard T Powers last album\nWaveforms a wicked album but\ngoes off the deep end now and\nthen. This ones nowhere near as\ndark or minimal as Waveforms, it's a much more accessible album.\nThis ones packed full of TV film\nsamples and even street preachers\nas in Rambling going on about\nglobal pollution, Weasenstein with\na sample from a early Frankenstein\nfilm 1 think, and Flying Saucers with\nnot surprisingly samples from TV\nfilms and news about flying\nsaucers all superbly blended with\nchopped and stretched beats 'n' breaks and they all work so well.\nAll this is not as serious as it\nmight sound T Power says\n\"Spaghettification is a complete\nparody of everything that we're\nnormally serious about\" and Cris\nadds \"it's about moving away from\nD& J5, because you can't take the\npiss within D&B\" It's all the little touches that\nmake this such an essential piece\nof listening, and they're what keep\nyou interested. This is also what\nseparates the innovators and the\nimitators and Chocolate Weasel\ndefinitely aren't the latter.\nJP\n\n"

He must also have enjoyed leading\nsuch a distinguished cast, although\nit seems as if Irons, Malkovich and\nthe rest couldn't quite agree on\nwhether to camp it up entirely or\nplay everything straight. The\natrocious dialogue would favour\nthe former, yet Irons in particular\ntakes his role seriously, even when\nendlessly repeating, \" One for all, all\nfor one.\" There is also inevitable\nconfusion on pronunciation and accent since the Musketeers come\nfrom three different countries.\nBut one can't be too harsh on a film which is clearly aiming to be an\namusing couple of hours rather\nthan an epic. Ignoring the prestige\nof the names on the title sequence\nwill allow the audience to sit back\nand let the Saturday matinee script\nand swashbuckling roll over them.\nEven then, some may find the\nchee sines s of the finale hard to\nstomach, but in terms of mindless\nenjoyable nonsense for women especially, The Man in the Iron\nMask is fine.

Having made his name by showing\na generation of steel workers that there is\nmore to life than welding in dance-as-symbol-of-freedom classic Flashdance, and dissected\nthe nature of obsession in the infamous Basic\nInstinct, he now draws on his own experience to\ntell the story of a young Hungarian immigrant to\nthe United States.\nIt is the early sixties in Cleveland Ohio, and Brad Renfro is de spa rate to become an\nAmerican. He is enchanted by the world of rock\nand roll, so when he is offered the chance to\nwork for DJ Kevin Bacon he eagerly grabs it.\nRenfro learns all about the American way of\ndoing things when he becomes involved in some\ndod gy dealings with a record company.\nIt comes as no surprise that this is Esterhas'\npet project. The subject matter is far less lurid\nthan his recent output, and not the sort of thing\nthat screams commercial success. His assertion\nthat the basis of the script was written many\nyears ago is very easy to believe, as the plot\nstumbles from one adolescent fantasy to the\nnext. This is a semi-autobiographical tale, with\nthe emphasis firmly on the \" semi\". Unless, of\ncourse, a vice girl really did service the seventeen year old Esterhas outside the confines of\nhis imagination.\nThis film treats a potentially interesting subject in a boring, and at times ludicrous, manner.\nThere is perhaps one entertaining moment in\nthe whole film, but it fails to atone for the hour\nand a half of self-indulgent nonsense ll Simon Bradley\nTwentyFourSeven\nStarring: Bob Hoskins, Bruce Jones, Danny Nuss baum Direct on Shane Meadows Shane Meadows made25 short films before 247, his\nfirst feature-length picture,\nand put the experience he gained\nto good use in creating an intelligent and moving film.\n247 is shot entirely in black and white, which helps to convey its\nmessage and give the audience a clearer insight into the characters'\nworld. The film is set in and around\na housing estate in Nottingham and centres around a group of lads who cannot break their 2 4 7 . 2 4 hours a day, 7 days a week their lives\nremain exactly the same signing\non and hanging around on the\nstreets doing nothing except get-ifk.it it\nting into trouble. However, there is\none man, Bob Hoskins, who tries\nto install some purpose into their\nlives by starting up a boxing club.\nHoskins is a lonely man, and it is\npossible to think that he starts up\nthe club to give himself some dire c tion. Although this is true in part,\nhis real motive is to help others and to form a sense of community.\nEverything goes well for them until\ntheir first match with another boxing club, when Hoskins can no\nlonger tolerate one of the lads'\nfathers who beats his wife and son. This film has many themes running through it and is also quite\nfunny in places as the characters\nHoskins discusses tactics with his boys\nattempt to cope with their\nsituation. Shane Meadows puts\nacross the message that every\nsingle person, is special and demonstrates this through Hoskins\nhimself. We see him at the beginning of the film as a tramp living in\nan old train carriage. We learn of\nhis story through the film and by\nthe end we really care for this old\ntramp, due mainly to one of\nHoskin's finest performances. He is\nalso ably supported by the support\ncast who include many actors in\ntheir first role.\nIf you want to see something a little bit different, I would definitely\nrecommend247. D Adam\n\n"

The incidents of theft have increased since\nthen and items swiped include a walkman, a playstation, a cash box\nand around \u00a3 1 0 0 0 worth of photographic equipment. Property has\nalso disappeared from the war-den's and sub warden's flats. All the rooms are thought to have\nbeen locked, and there were no signs of forced entry. Richard\nDashwood, the warden of the hall,\nexplained that \"I can't think of any\nincidents at Bernard Sunley this\nyear or the year before, but now there's a sudden increase and I want to see some action taken to\nrectify the situation... It's a mystery why it's happening, no master\nkeys are missing.\"\nConcern has also been raised\nover the level of security cover for\nEvelyn Gardens, after the security\nlodge was closed for financial reasons last year. Ken Weir, IC's Chief\nSecurity Officer, denied that this\nwas a factor; \" Not for one minute\nwould it have made any differ-en ce\", he argued, adding that the\nlayout of the halls made standard\nsecurity patrols ineffective. \"The\nthieves can simply target the building that the security officer has just\nleft.\" Mr Dashwood disagreed, opining \"I honestly believe that a[ security] man on site does act as\na deterrent\". He went on to explain that he had 'blitzed' the\nrelevant parties, and that Security,\nthe Accommodation Office and Felix Editor Arrested in Drugs Scandal JONATHAN TROUT\nFelix has been cast into disarray\nand anarchy following the shock\narrest of its editor Mr Jeremy\nThomson. Police entered the\nnewspaper's office in the North\nWest corner of Beit Quad late on Monday evening and found Mr Thomson at his\ndesk. To the\namazement of the\nassembled student\njournalists, he was detained and charged with the\nsupply of large\nquantities of\nLysergic Acid Diethylamide( LSD), a class A drug.\nThomson is A cross marks the spot; the\nbelieved to have alleged location of the drug dot\npersonally placed a second staple head. Editor elect,\nMr Edward Sexton took control of\nthe publication following an emergency meeting with ICU representatives. It later emerged that Mr Sexton himself may be implicated\nin the stunt, having admitted that\nhe stole a Gilson pipette from the\nBiology department for Thomson\nlast week. \"It was a favour for a friend, I had no idea that it\nwould be used for\nillegal purposes\",\nexplained Mr Sexton.

    "content": "25 March 1998 MUSIC 31\nCLUB SCENE COMPILATIONS ESSENTIAL OLD SKOOL HARDCORE\nMIXED BY DONAVON \"BAD BOY\" SMITH (DC1)\nBefore D83, before jungle\nthere was the original hardcore sound. As house went\nacidic in the late 80's a new strain\nof dance music was born using hiphop breakbeat s as it's heart. It was\nheavier, harder and faster than anything before. It was the soundtrack\nto the rave scene across the UK.\nDonavon \"Bad Boy\" Smith, one\nof the original DJs and producers,\nhas expertly mixed together 24 true\noriginal hardcore classics as only\nsomeone with his experience\ncould. I have always liked the Bad\nBoy's mixing and this is no disappointment. It brought back so\nmany memories of times 1 doubt I 'll\nsee again.\nThis double CD pack is just\nram-jam-packed full of so so many\ngroundbreaking pieces of work it's hard to believe. There's even some\nin here that I don't recognize.\nDance Conspiracy's Dui) War\ngets us underway with that serious\nsub-bass and beautiful breakdown\nclosely followed by Zero B's Lockup - not the mix that's normally played, so it's nice to see the\nBad Boy staying away from the\nobvious choices. As there are so\nmany other great tunes from this\nera.\nTwo tracks from the superb\nRhythm 4 Reason are featured here\nand as with many of these tunes\nit's not only the shit hot use of\ndrum patterns, a whole array of different b lines and clever samples,\nbut the astoundingly deep break-downs. It's amazing how they stir\nup such strong emotions; they still\nsend a shiver down my spine.\nThe first time 1 listened to this,\nI kept thinking \"I hope this tracks\non there\" and then it would come on. Believe me, they're all on here\nand then some. A really comprehensive review of the 9 2 - 9 4 rave\nscene.\nAt this point 1 must come back\nto the mixing - which is second to\nnone. If you don't know these\ntracks inside out it can all go pear\nshaped very easily. This is a time\nbefore the music was so styled and\nseparated. A time when you could\nstill play what resembles D& J5,\nJungle, Breakbeat, Happy Hardcore\n(4 beat) and Techno alongside\neach other.\nThe Bad Boy knows exactly\nwhen to put the mixes in and when\nto take them out. There are a few\nhairy moments, but you' d only\nnotice them if you listen extremely\nclosely, and it's always suitable\nresolved. One of the best tunes on\nhere is the Bad Boy's very own track Obsession - one of my\nfavorite tunes of all time.\nSo if, like me, you grew up in\nthe rave culture this is an absolute\nmust. I promise you will not be dis-appointed. For the uninitiated this\nis your chance to hear what you missed and find out what ali the\nfuss is about.\nIP\nCLUB SCENE SINGLES DRUM* N* BASS ADR Feat. Brown Girl. Burning\n(Deconstruction) Out Now.\nV. l.P dub is the pick of the bunch\nand the one your probably hear in\nthe clubs. Starts out with nicely\nchopped up beats and a siren n' acid influences. The powerful bass\ndrum sets the pace, looped title\nvocal that you all should know by\nnow and gun shoots take you to\nthe break. In drops the heavy duty\nsub-bass &. strong old skool influences, sounds slightly dated but I like it and it's well made. Rugged and Tough. The Sound /\nGot to Get (Confetti Rec) March.\nThis is a track with silky smooth production skills, a very full &. deep sound, slow beats, dark intrusive\nsub-bass, haunting keys that fits\ntogether tightly with a stunning\nfemale vocal that should complete\nthe track perfectly, but this is\nwhere it all goes wrong, as the\nlyrics ruin it for me \" This is the\nsound I love, when I'm rocking in\nthe rave with the massive 'n' crew\"\nBut then again I'm particularly\npicky about things like that.\nCirco Castelli. Roadblock\n(S.I Projects) 30 March.\nThe best way to describe this is as\na jazz-house fusion, with a distinctive piano cx snare intro, then\ncomes in a double bass sounding\nb line and a fast tempo bass drum\nthis all works well together. But\nthe piano comes in too strong and\nfor too long. Apart from that the\ntrack is OKa good idea that\ndoesn't really work that well. If you like jazz and house then this should\nbe right up your street.\nGoldie. Believe. Groove vocal &\ndub mix (Metalheadz) 23 March\nNo, this isn'ta misprint. A garage\ntune on Metal head z the home of\ndark ' n' hard drum and bass. Very\npleasant female vocal and cool\nelectro breakbeat s make up the\nintro, then in roll the stepping\ngarage beats. All this has a very\noriginal feel, a refreshing change\nfrom most of what you'll find in the\nshops. Dub mix toughens up the\nbeats &. cuts down the vocal. I prefer this mix but it's far to short.\nDEA Project. White Label\n(Marvel City Rec) Out Now\nAnother old skool remix but what a tune to remix a truly awe inspiring\ntrack. It's been given what is being\ncalled the \"smooth groove\" treat-ment; not the usual speed garage\nmix that most tunes get. This gives\nit a slight edge on the hoard of old\nskool remixes out at the moment.\nFlip-side has some two step business going on with pleasant female\nvocals, but it doesn't do much else\nbut that's why we mix.\nLook out for Flex Kru's, Watch\nthe Flex (issue 1108) as it's getting a full release on 23rd March.\nTheir ruff remix of Robbie\nWilliams latest tune is also due\nfor immanent release. Jo Public.\nAddiction/Carlito.Future Elements\n(Creative Source) Mid March.\nStrong hi-hat and percussion intro\nsoon joined by a double-bass\nsounding tone, piercing keys and a squealing trumpet takes you to the\nbreak. Fast stepping beats soon\ntake control cv soft touches of jazz\n- not too much, nice &. smooth for\nthe mix. One for the stepping and\njacking masses. Hey, hey. Flip-side\nhas tougher beats and stronger\natmospheric als in a jazzy style, and\nthose melodic keys give it a more\nintelligent feel.\nThe Prisoners Of Technology.\nCrazy/Cold Blooded (Fresh Kutts)\n23 March.\nAnother strong release from the\nP.O.T boys, and this ones right up\nthere with their previous releases,\nwhich is no mean feat. Crazy is a dark jump-up sort of tune with a fresh rinsing b line, but the one\nthat's been making all the noise is\nCold Blooded. It has a fuller sound,\nmore complete, building beats with\nnice little cut backs and an accompanying bell tone. Sirens and title\nvocals take you to the break then\nwatch out for yet another phat filtered b line. I can't wait for the\nnext one.\nArtemis. Inner World / Sun Stars\n(Goodlooking Rec.) 6th April.\nIn that traditional GL style, meandering string intro punctuated with\nacoustic guitar and shortly followed\nby those rolling breakbeat s, high\nfrequency chimes and an un in tru sive b line. Sun Stars is more of the\nsame; deep' n' rolling breaks\ndreamy atmospheric als and careful\nEqing give it a panoramic feel. Are\nyou ready for a journey deep into\nthe sub-conscious?,This one's sure\nto keep GL fans more than happy.\nScorpio. Trouble\n(V Rec.) Out Now.\nThis is fast becoming a label like\nMetal head z&. Go og looking, where\nyou can buy every release and\nyou' re almost guaranteed it's gonna be wicked. They've done it\nagain, with another storming release from V records. I didn't think they could match Warhead\nbut they keep doing it - metallic\nechoing bass drum and, when it\ndrops in, watch out for those serious stepping beats and a variation\nof that awesome bassline.\nMoving Fusion. Turbulence\n(Ram Rec) Out Now.\nThis is a limited edition sampler\nfrom the forth coming Sound In\nMotion album that is set to blow up\nlike Chernobyl, and is due for\nrelease mid-April. My local shop\nsold 25 copies of this single on the\nfirst day it was released. A totally\nruff tune and check the bole bole\nbassline, that's been tearing up all\nthe right clubs around the country.\nIt's even getting quite regular plays\non the radio. Enough said. JP\n\n"

The courses at Imperial\nCollege are demanding;' they require\ncommitment of time and effort. It s not unusual to experience a knock to your self-este ej ij po find yourself amongst similarly intelligent students after having ||jen at or near\nthe top of your class at school.\nYou might have arrived at Imperial from another country with different social and cultural norms so that part of beginning at College\ninvolves the experience of living in a different culture. Family and\nfriends may be a long distance away. And if you're coming to College\nstraight from home you may have to learn the practicalities of everyday living as well! Coming to university might be one of the biggest\ntransitions you' re going to make in your life.\nIf you're not used to organising yourself and getting on with studying\nwithout a parent or teacher prompting you, it can be a considerable\nchallenge to manage your work. On the other hand, sometimes students work too hard and get diminishing returns; fear of failure or 'let-ting people down' can get in the way of constructive studying.\nAll of this needs energy which you might have plenty of. However,\nsometimes personal issues demand energy which you would otherwise be using to get on with your life. Sometimes you'll know what\nthe problem is, eg a relationship difficulty, a bereavement, an issue\nabout self-confidence. But sometimes you might be aware of feeling\ndepressed or anxious, of finding it difficult to concentrate at lectures\nor when studying, for no immediately identifiable reason.\nMany students have found it useful to come to counselling when\nthey're feeling troubled, to talk about their experience, to think\nthrough a problem and to consider options and create a strategy to\nmove forward. Issues students have brought since I took up post last\nSeptember include: blocks to studying and exam stress; relationship\ndifficulties; family difficulties; homesickness; depression; anxiety;\nbereavement: sexuality and sexual orientation.\nThe service is confidential.

In some c irc um stances, your choice of action may carry consequences that are not immediately apparent and a different perspective can often be useful.\nI work from a large information system and the Union subscribes to several\norganisations that provide assistance for certain student groups (for example UK COSA, who provide a service to international students).\nIam familiar with the problems and incidents that student's commonly face.\nFor example, I deal with many enquiries regarding private sector housing\nmatters ranging from checking contracts to problems with disrepair, harassment and other inter-tenant disputes.\n1 can also help students with financial problems. Debt is inevitable for most\nstudents. If you think your finances are running out then come and see me.\nSometimes (though not often) there are benefits that can be claimed, payments that can be reduced (particularly credit debts), and other organisations who might be able to offer financial help.\nOccasionally it is necessary to refer students to outside agencies, maybe to\nget specialised legal advice, or for support and help for a particular client\ngroup. There may also be occasions where it will be appropriate to refer you\nto other members of College staff (ie perhaps the Counsellor, College\nTutors, or Disabilities Officer). In any event, your situation will not be discussed with anyone else without your express permission.\nThe Advice Service is strictly confidential, impartial and non-judgemental. It\ndoesn't matter what your situation is, or how you arrived at it. My job is to\ntry and assist, not to apportion blame.\nI can be seen by appointment 1 1.00-4.30pm on Monday, Wednesday and\nFriday and between 10.30-4.00pm on Tuesday and Thursday.

Tell me about the people\nyou play with, how did you all get together.\nMe and Pogo got together on Sparky's recommendation about three years ago. I met Sparky in the early, erm, mid, erm,\nlate eighties [laughs]. He was producing\nin London and he used one of my records\nas part of the hip hop thing in 1988. At\nthe time, technology was not at the standard it is now, but on this TV show on\nChannel Four, and it was great, and I approached him from that. I was also\ndoing Jazzmatazz at the time /the ground-breaking, multi gold selling jazz/ hip hop\nfusion project by Guru, featuring the best\nin the jazz world with the best DJs, rappers and producers] and meeting up with\na lot of the guys who I kept seeing on\nboth sides of the Atlantic. I was having a bit of trouble with having to hire a band in\nAmerica, and these were the guys that I ended up working with. I played with Jeff\nWatts on Guru, and a couple of the other close to the underground drum and bass\nguys. scene.\nTracks from Courtney's last album have been given\nthe treatment by remix specialists Roni Size and\nPeshay. What does that bring to the sound? How\ncould the process be improved?\n/ think that it gives a different hand, really talented, experienced people giving\nanother view, and I wish I was actually\nable to play on top of them. In the drum\nand bass scene this is how it's being done\nnow. On the Adam F album, he sent it to\nGrooverider, they did their thing and sent\nit back to him for him to work on. I think\nthat that is what I 'll be getting into.\nIf the old school\nwant to keep to\ntheir own jazz\nthing, well thats\nfine, but we are\ngoing somewhere\nelse\"\nWhat took you to New York to record the album?\nWell, not only am I signed to an American\nlabel, but the studios over there are just\nincredible, and most of the musicians on\nthe record are based in New York. It\nseemed the right thing to do.\nWhat do you think of the UK underground scene;\nhow does it compare to and differ from the US?\nOh, it differs! In America, there is no\n'underground scene' as such, in terms of\njazz; but over here, it's buzzing. We have\nbands, musicians, we don't have a lot on\nthe recording side; that's almost how I would define 'underground'. It's very\nHow far apart are the jazz and drum and bass scenes\nat the moment?\n/ don't think that they are very far apart\nat all. If I can go on stage with a DJ, a hip\nhop DJ, and make really positive music,\nthen there isn't really any difference with\nthat and going on with a drum and bass\nDJ, and that will happen soon. I don't think that they are far apart; if you take\nsomeone like Roni Size and myself, we\nare both going to the same place, we are\njust on different sides of the same fence.\nWhat is your perspective on jazz and the music\nindustry at this time?\nIt's going through an interesting phase.\nEveryone is talking about underground;\nit's become a bit of a buzzword. There are\na lot of people involved in it, people like\nGoldie, obviously Roni [Size] now. Ronni\nJordan, at times. You know, people were\ntalking about these guys and they were\ninfiltrating the popular music scene. But\nit's not got the place it should have done,\nand what's happening is that jazz is being\nassimilated into popular music. I was listening to the Propellerheads, with Shirley\nBassey, and you can see the way that\njazz has been absorbed, without saying\n\"JAZZ!\". You only need to look at\nPortishead; it's jazz, but people have\nrealised that you can't call it jazz, 'cos if\nyou say \"jazz\" you're not going to get no\nplay with that name.\nSo you think that jazz has got an image problem?\nIn this country it always did have. It\nchanged direction and the people who\nwere into that thing just aren't around\nany more.\nWho is up and coming in this country? Jazz or otherwise? In this country, well, there are some phenomenal musicians; Jason Robello is on\nhis way back, so it will be interesting to\nsee what he does. I like the Cleveland\nWatkiss P23 project, I 've already mentioned Roni Size, erm, Photek's album.\n\n"

V2\nCadbury's Buttons\nPrice: \u00a31.29\nDescription: So small it barely qualifies as an egg at all.\nComments: Initial reactions were\npoor, with the diminutive packaging\nonly compounding the rubbery texture of the low-cocoa chocolate.\nThere was some debate over the\naftertaste - milky or soapy? The\ncheeky pocket-sized packet of\nButtons will cheer up the most dismal\nof days.\nThe Verdict: It's not something that\nyou would eat for pleasure. * Ht\nTerry's Chocolate\nOrange\nPrice: \u00a32.99\nDescription: Not an egg at all, but\nmore like a reddish-coloured sphere\nof cocoa. To put it another way, it's a chocolate orange.\nComments: On opening the box,\nour investigator was deeply disappointed to find nothing but air. On closer inspection, an 'egg' was discovered at the bottom, hiding\nbehind a molecule. Smooth, rich\nchocolate was munched aside to\nreveal a treasure of bite-sized citrus\nblobs. Most satisfactory.\nThe Verdict: An egg for life, not just\nfor Easter. * # # *\n\n"

The show itself will be\non Sky this easter, and on terrestrial TV later this year. The game\nisn't scheduled to hit shelves until\n1999.\nLara Croft in the flesh\nThe dream of all sad, lone y Tomb Raider addicts is to meet Lara Croft\nin the flesh. All of you will be glad\nto know that this is possible, as\nEidos have appointed french babe\nVanessa Demo u y to be\nthe official 'real\nLara'.\nExpect to see\nher gracing adverts\nand magazine near\nyou soon...\nTomb Raider\nmovie?\nGames based on movies are common, although\nmovies based\non games are normally\nfairly poor efforts (Street Fighter in particular\nwas appalling). However, for the\nnew Tomb Raider movie the producer of Boogie Nights has agreed\nto take control. Lawrence Gordon has also worked on Die Hard and Predator, so action flicks are nothing new to him.\nNo news yet on who will play\nLara, unfortunately.\nShrinking Street Fighters\nCapcom certainly haven't finished\nmilking the Street Fighters games\nyet. Pocket Fighters, based on the\nSF Puzzle game, features a simplified control system (only 3\nbuttons) and cute sey graphics.\nIt remains to be seen whether\nthe public will be impressed with\nyet more derivative SF clones.\nAtari remembered\nHasbro now has the rights to over\n75 classic Atari games, and plans\nto produce updated version.

It differs\nfrom the usual fare in an important\naspect; The aim is not to win races\nbut to become the most 'chilled'\nboarder on the slopes.\nIn practice this means a more\nrelaxed approach than simply rushing to the next checkpoint, and more importance given to performing stunts and tricks.\nWorld League Soccer\nOut in May on PC and PlayStation\nReleased to coincide with the start\nof the World Cup, W LS features\nover 190 teams from 10 different\nleagues, cove ing all major soccer\nworldwide.\nA new 'skeletal' system of animation provides fluid motion, and the gameplay promises to recreate\nthe real 'flow' of a football game.\nWith commentary from Channel\n4's Peter Brackley and Ray Wilkins,\nthis is a serious contender for the\nfooty game crown.\nStar Trek: Secret of Vulcan\nFury\nAlthough Interplay have already\nreleased two Trek-based point and\nclick adventures, this one should\nbe different.

The only nice touch\ncomes from the neat backgrounds\nrepresenting the worlds of the Star\nWars universe. At-at's clomp around Hoth, swamp-things and\nYoda's hut loom out of the darkness on Dagoba - you get the idea.\nYet it's in the gameplay that the\ngame really lets you down. All the\ncharacters have only a couple of\nspecial moves (which are suspiciously similar for several of them),\nand try as hard as I might, I could\nnever get the blasters/crossbows to\nwork. For almost all the characters,\nit basically descends into the traditional frenzy of button bashing that\nI thought we'd finally seen the back\nof.\nThe only exception comes with Luke. After about ten minutes of play it became obvious\nthat by far the easiest way to win\nis to play as Luke, w ip out your\nlightsaber and slash the opposition to pieces - so much so that\nin two-player mode we had to\nration out how many times we got to play the saintly one.\nLucas Arts - please stick to X Wing and the like, and stop\nfollowing the path of the \"shame-less cash in\".

    "content": "25 March 1998\nBRE KEKE K EX COAX COAX FROGS\nCourtyard Theatre\nMy love affair with Greek\ndrama started with a production of Frogs, which I saw at a tender age. The immortal\nlines have haunted me ever since,\nand so I was keen to see this production of one of my favourite\nplays. The play is a low comedy about the roles of poetry and poets, with a biting satirical edge.\nBriefly, Dionysis discovers that\nTHEATRE 39\nthere are no decent poets about\nnow Aeschylus and Euripides are\ndead, and as Patron of Theatre, he\nmight be out of a job. So, he and\nhis grumbling slave go down to\nHades to rescue one of the two\ngeniuses. On the way, he meets\nHeracles and the musical frogs,\nwho sing all day in the marshes and\nbogs. Dionysis doesn't like their\nsinging, and tells them so in a beautifully poignant speech.\nThe production at the\nCourtyard brings out the physical\nhumour of the play, and also what I imagine to be the rhythms of\nAncient Greece. The choruses are\nsung, livening up otherwise fairly\ndull chunks of speech. The comic\nrivalry between Aeschylus and Euripides is wonderfully done, bringing out the differ ance in\nrhythm between the two writers.\nThe director has stuck faithfully to\nthe costumes of the time, and has-n't cut any of the political satire.\nThis is important; the play, like others of Aristophanes, has a serious\nmessage about civil war.\nGo and see this, it's fun, it's live-ly, it's entertaining, and I really\nenjoyed it.\nJulia H WAITING FOR GODOT\nPiccadilly Theatre\nSamuel Beckett' s famous plot less play arrives at the\nPiccadilly for an evening of wit and puzzlement. Over forty years ago, it catapulted Peter Hall to fame when he\ndirected the world premiere. Now, after a distinguished career during which he founded the Royal Shakespeare Company, he'shaving another go at\nit. '\nWith only a barren tree and a rock for company, two tramps ramble around a barren stage, bored,\nspending the entire play waiting for\nGodot. Julian Glover and Alan\nDobie throw themselves with gusto\ninto the tramps' shoes and make a lively job with the clever script.\nThey clown about the stage eliciting\nsome great slapstick moments. 1\nfound following the endless stream\nof subtle witticisms tiring, although\nthe other theatre goers around me\nwere chuckling knowledgeably.\nThe play's success lies in the\ndepth of the characters' dialogue\nand predicament. They strive to\nachieve firm conclusions about life,\nbut every question they ask leads\nto an argument, serving only to\nraise more questions. Their entire\nexistence is characterised by a hideous, inescapable uncertainty.\nThey are interrupted by the\narrival of P oz zo,a country gentleman on the verge of insanity, and\nhis maltreated servant Lucky. Their\ncuriously symbiotic relationship\nand insane behaviour make the two\ntramps seem almost normal. \"Haven't they changed?\" one tramp\nsays referring to P ozz o and Lucky\nafter they've left,despite never having met them before. The first half\nof the play ends with the arrival of\na small boy announcing that Godot will not be coming that day.\nThe second half is essentially\nthe same as the first; P ozz o and\nLucky appear again, unable to recall\nhaving met the tramps before. Even\nthe tramps are not totally certain.\nOnce again the boy comes to tell\nthem that Godot will not be coming that day, but denies meeting them\nthe day before. The tramps desperately question the boy, their only\nlink to the outside world, only to be\nfrustrated as the boy retreats off\nstage. Although the boy appears\nonly twice during the play, it is\nunderstood that in the timeless\nworld of the tramps, he has been\nseen for eternity. As Vivian Mercer\nput it: \"Waiting for Godot is a play\nin which nothing happens, twice\"\nAs an interesting evening of\nhighbrow wit and profound it y, the\nplay excels. Seats are fairly ex pen sive, so if you prefer a more concrete plot, set in the real world then\nI would recommend something else.\nAntony Butts\nBEYOND ECSTASY\nThe Brix\nF or those of you who feel that\ntheatre is for the chords and\njacket wearing middle aged,\nit's time your minds were opened. There's no need for cannabis,\ncrack, speed, LSD, or even ecstasy\nbecause Beyond Ecstasy manages\nto dispel any pre-conceived ideas\nabout the theatre and certainly\nopens your mind-plus it's completely legal.\nThere's so much to say about\nBeyond Ecstasy that I don't intend\nto waste space writing about the\nplot, apart from the fact that it's a love story about a young prostitute\ntrying to escape to London only to\nget drawn into a world of drugs.\nNothing new there, I hear you say,\nnothing which has not been covered by the range of new plays in\nthe past few years looking at similar aspects of society- Trainspotting or Shopping and Fucking.\nWhere this play excels is in the\natmosphere that it creates, the way\nthat the play was put together, the\nrelationships on stage, and the\naudience that it appeals to.\nAs 1 lingered in the bar before\nthe performance, I was struck by\nthe type of people around me. It\nwas a mass of stylish 20-some-things, none of whom would have\nlooked out of place in any of the\nbest clubs or pubs in the capital. A far cry from the National or the\ntourist riddled musicals. What was I to expect? The auditorium was\nalive. The Dj on the decks was mixing a blend of loud fast dance, the\nstage teeming with a visual display\nof Acid House Cinema and cruising\nlights-the play had not yet even\nbegun. As the lights faded two\ndancers appeared on and the\naction began.\nThroughout the performance\nthe music was coming from the Dj\nmixing it there and then, recreating\nthe atmosphere of the clubs and\nlives we were following. The pop style lighting enhanced the simple\nset to allow easy and flowing\nchanges between scenes from\nclubs to sitting rooms to cars to\ndream-like states of drug influenced minds. The play does not\nonly use technical effects to gain\nappeal. Beyond Ecstasy was\ndevised by the company using\nstructured improvisation around a story, allowing it to alter and change in three years so it's still rel-evan t, funny and realistic. Conversations are un scripted and true to\nlife, characters are reflective of\nthose you see around you, and onstage relationships are truly touch-ing. Beyond Ecstasy lives and works\noff it's own upbringing and forma-tion.\nThe first half is amusing, fast\nand enthralling, the second gro t esque, terrible but satisfying. The\nplot does not go as far as to advocate the use of drugs, but it certainly falls short of showing their\ndownside. But this is not the point.\nIt is not meant to be an education,\nit's a story represented and portrayed for youth with emotions\nthey know and feel. There are plans\nto make it into a film, something\nthat should work if the same spirit\nand conviction is carried through.\nBeyond Ecstasy is not a night of\npolite entertainment, it's a night to\nenjoy, relish and live.\nMatt Williams\n\n"

Student Life, sponsored\nby Channel 4, asked 6,349 finalists at 19 universities around the\ncountry, including UCL and IC\nabout their finances, lifestyles,\nattitudes to the media and plans\nfor life.\n16% of the students inter-viewed said had they been\nmade to pay tuition fees of\n\u00a3 1 , 0 0 0 a year they would have\nbeen unlikely to have come to\nuniversity at all, whilst forty percent of those surveyed would have stayed away if they had\nknown about the potential\n\u00a3 10,000 debts they may face on\ngraduation. The survey also\nrevealed that 66% of students\nconsidered cannabis an acceptable drug for personal use, with\nonly 14% approving of cocaine\nand 5% in favour of heroin and\ncrack. Friends was the most\npopular TV show and the Spice\nGirls were the personalities with\nwhom students would least like\nto be stuck in a lift.

Following months of arguments\nbetween the directors of\nSchindlers and the workers' union, where the union claimed\nthe proposed deal \"greatly\nreduces our earnings while\nadversely affecting our individual\ncontracts\" and saw the strike as\ntheir only alternative.

NEWS\nCannabis Campaign Hits the Park\nED SEXTON\nThis Saturday (28 March) thousands of protesters will in arch through London in the largest\npro-cannabis demonstration to\nbe held in the capital for thirty\nyears. The event is being organised by the Independent on\nSunday, which is attempting to\nincrease the profile of its 'de criminal is e cannabis' campaign.\nIndeed the march already looks\nset to be a high profile event, with\nparticipants including Paul Flynn,\nthe Labour MP heading efforts to\nchange the law on cannabis, and\nMarco Pennella, founder of the\nItalian Radical Party. A host of\nother politicians and campaigners\nare expected to show their sup-port; Howard Marks, the ex-smug-g ler[ Felix 1095], will be speaking at\nthe event, as will Independent on\nSunday editor Rosie Boycott, who started the campaign last\nSeptember. Many bands and performers are expected to be among the crowd, including Dodgy, Paul\nWeller, Primal Scream and Finley\nQuaye.\nActivist Howard Marks smoking\na hand-rolled cigarette\nThe march begins at midday by\nReformers Tree in Hyde Park and\nwill proceed to Trafalgar Square,\nwhere the speakers will address the\nrally. It is uncertain how many people will take part in the protest: A few weeks ago police estimated\nbetween five and ten thousand\nwould attend the event, but they\nhave since revised their estimate\nand now fear that the crowd may\nexceed the 16,000 capacity of\nTrafalgar Square. Speaking to Felix,\nChris Brown, a voluntary helper and\nspokesperson for the march, suggested that there may be as many\nas 3 0 , 0 0 0 on the rally, although he\ndid point out that \"it could be any\nsize\".\nThe purpose of the demonstration is to move the cannabis debate\non, putting pressure on the government to review the 1971 Misuse of\nDrugs Act. Mr Brown expressed his\nwish for the march to highlight the\nserious issues surrounding\ncannabis use, particularly its role in\nrelieving the symptoms of many\ndiseases, such as arthritis, MS and\nAIDS. He added\" I don't want it to\nbe a big spl iff rally.\"\nMore information about the\nmarch and the Independent on\nSunday's campaign can be found at\nwww. independent, co. uk/s indy pot/ ULU Election Results - Do You Care?\nDAVID ROBERTS\nThe elections for next year's University of London Union sabbatical team took place last\nMonday, attracting heavy criticism of their electoral process,\nand loud bellows of \"Farce\" from\nICU President Andy Heeps.\n85 people are eligible to vote in\nthe elections, which determine next\nyear's President, three VicePresidents and the editor for UL U'ss tt f dent newspaper, London\nStudent. The electoral process\ncame under fire from the entire IC\ndelegation, with last year's ICU\nPresident, Eric Allsop, suggesting\nthat \"totalitarian dictatorships show\nmore signs of democracy\", and\nraiding questions as to whether the\ngeneral student populace \"actually\ncare\". The main objection was the\nquizzing of the candidates at the\ndiscretion of the returning officer,\nwho was not a himself a student.\nAmongst those elected was Rob\nClark, this year's Deputy President\n(Finance &. Services) at ICU, who won unopposed as UL U VP\n(Finance Societies) for 1998-9,\non a platform of financial stability\nand accountability.\nElsewhere, Matt Hyde, presently President of Queen Mary&. Westfield Union emerged victorious\nover Mari Williams, to win the election for UL U President. In a bizarre\nturn-around on previous years', Ms Williams admission of Labour membership resulted in boos and jeering\nfrom the assembled delegates,\nwhilst Mr Hyde's promise not to\ntow the NUS line was received with\ncheers from the floor. Mr Hyde\npromised to ensure value-for-money for UL U colleges by\n\"Providing strong services... looking\nbeyond Mallet Street, taking UL U to\nit's member colleges... finding\nuntapped areas.\" Nick Dunnett,\nfrom Royal Holloway College, won unopposed as VP (Sports). He\ninsisted that UL U sport is still\nimportant, \"playing in London wide\nteams is the only time that we can\ncome together as one complete\nUniversity\", although he did accept\nthat \"we need to review ail intercollegiate sport so that everyone\ncan maximise their potential\". In his\nmanifesto Mr Dunnett also\npromised to prior it is e safety, so\nthat \"every sportsperson knows\nthat they play in a 'Safe Sport'\", and\nto strive to increase outside sponsorship. The third Vice-President pos i tion, that of VP (Welfare 8. Student\nAffairs), was filled by Bee Kiiroy,\nfrom the School of Slavonic and\nEast European Studies. She\npromised to be a \"Strong and independent voice, reflecting action\".\nShe saw her primary role as cam-pai g ning, particularly on tuition fees\n\"an area I feel passionately about...\nI see them as a threat to basic student rights\". To this end, she\npromised to promote access to\ninformation on campaigning,\nincluding a 'campaigns database'\naccessible on the WWW. Like her\nopponents, Marc Jay and Allan\nWitherick, Ms Kiiroy also promised\nto work on the problem of accommodation \"which is both expensive\nand insufficiently catered for by col-leg es.\" Finally, Tom Belton, currently\neditor of Roar (the King's College\nnewspaper), was elected as London\nStudent Editor for 1998-9. Although\nhaving no experience at London\nStudent, Mr Belton promised to\nensure that \"the paper will come\nout fortnightly and in full colour\",\nmaking it \"a reliable and regular\nentity\". He also promised to secure\na28 day FM radio license \"to cover\nfresher s week\", and to secure a profitable advertising deal, so that\n\"it will eventually make a profit and\ncease to be a drain on Union\nfunds.\"\n\n"

    "content": "25 March 1998 MUSIC 27\nTHABO MBI The last week of term and we look at what's happening down at KISS FM.\nWhat's up! Last week of term and people out\nthere just chill in', well y 'all can stop chill in' and\nstart reading cause I got a page load of stuff for\nya. This weeks Phat Selection is an Essential\nSelection, a compilation of the best from the\npast couple of months. The rest is the usual shit,\nnews and reviews.\nWhat the hell is happening down at Kiss FM, they have gone from getting the best of the\nunderground DJs and promoting them, to simply\nsigning high profile figureheads. Obviously Iam talking about the Dani Behr situation. Dani has\nbeen signed to do her own weekday radio show\nfrom 4 til 8, although she has no previous radio\nexperience. She's been put together with two other current presenters, Janice Vee and Lorraine Ashdown. So far the show's not been\nall that bad, but the long primetime slot has\nmeant pushing back the spec a list shows and only time will tell if this leads to a lack of real\nquality R& \u00a3 on Kiss. I hope not but I got a funny\nfeeling.\nAt last, the huge Destiny's Child No, No, No\ngets a UK release. What's the problem with\nrecord companies over here? Huge floor fillers\nlike Destiny's Child don't get a UK release for\ntime, why? It's so simple, it's all about the\nmoney. Releasing on import means the track\ncan build up some hype, DJs be playing it, peeps\nhear it, they want it, but it costs (you know \u00a3 6\nto \u00a37 on import); so when it eventually gets a UK release its gonna go thru' the roof. The\nbest example is the Usher gem You A/ lake....'\nreleased on import in September. People were\nlovin' this, and when it got its UK release in\nJanuary, we all know what happened, it flew\nstraight to the top spot.\nAt the same time\nimports are the shit,\ncause there are so many\ntracks that are the definition of phat ness that\nnever get a UK release.\nFrom the end of last year\nwe had M Q3's Everyday,\nwhich was doing da mage on the floors, but\nnever got the airplay or\nthe hype and I ended up\nparting ways with a fiver\nfor it. There are loads of\ntunes like that, you hear'em, hunt'em down,\nbut they're only there on\nimport. As long as\nthere's money to be\nmade, we gonna have to\nlive with it.\nOn the album front\ntwo more compilation\nalbums (yeah more fucking compilation albums)\nhave been released, but\nthese are not the usual\nshit; for once we have\ntwo wicked examples.\nFirst up there is the\nMastercuts Classic R&B.I know what you're\nthinking, this has been done before, but surprisingly not. Mastercuts have probably done every\nother mu sci al form including swing, hip hop and\neven jazz-hop but not R&B; the album is\ndescribed as a collection of classic R& J3 cuts\nfrom the ages, and this is packed full of dope\ntunes. The club classic Only You by 1 12 and\nBiggie is included, Faith Evans' / Just Can't Wait\nfrom the High School High Soundtrack and of\ncourse a track from the boys Jodeci Cef on Up.\nAs well as more from Blackstreet, D 'Angelo, Toni\nBraxton and Brian McKnight, this album is class\nbut there is a downside cause included on this is\naM as e track, and this track ain't classic R& J5.\nThe second compilation set is Kiss FM' s Smooth\nGrooves '98 double album. A collection of the\nbest tunes from the past year, it's all good here.\nThe range of tracks on this is very impressive,\nmixing up the best from hiphop and R8J3, with\nLLCool J's Phenomenon, Busta's smash Put Your\nHands..., the huge club hit from Biggie\nHyptonize, my favourite Wishing on A Star from\nJay Z, the killer You Know My Steez by Gangstarr\n(Nim!) as well as Rakim, Missy and many more;\non an R& J5 tip it's equally strong with Lynden's Sexy Cinderalla, Say Nothin' by Omar, K Ci and\nJojo's classic You Bring Me Up, the dope Brian\nMcKnight You Should Be Mine and more from\nAllure, En Vogue, Mary J. and Joe. You probably\ngot most of these but if you ain't, this is quality.\nStill on the album tip, there's lots to look out\nfor in the next few months.

    "content": "25 March 1998 MUSIC 25\nALBUMS\nJAMES\nBest of...\nEVERCLEAR\nSo Much for the\nEveryone knows at least one\nsong by James. They formed\nin the mid-eighties and\nbucked the whole idea of synthpop and the much hyped' New Wave' that was appearing in the\nmusic scene back then and instead\ncreated songs that mirrored the\nguitar pop of bands like the Smiths.\nThey hail from manchester and\nwere at their height in the baggy\n'Madchester' scene at the turn of\nthe decade along with bands like\nthe Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays and My Bloody Valentine.\nIn 1990, you couldn't go anywhere\nwithout seeing a James flower\nscribbled somewhere. Whether it\nwas on a wall, a poster, a magazine\nor on a schoolbook, it made certain\nthat the band's name was well-known. This was partially due to the\nre-release of the excellent single Sit\nDown around then which came shortly after what many still claim is\ntheir best album. Cold Mother was\nalmost a masterpiece. It seemed to\ntalk in the language of its fans and\nits songs were damn catchy. The\nband released Seven and Laid in\nthe early '90s but it was their last\nalbum Whiplash that seemed to\nbring them most success. This\nalbum contained songs that were\nvery indicative of their earlier\nefforts but brought them up to\ndate. The good thing about releasing a compilation of their best\nsongs, then, is that it unites all the\ndifferent sets of fans that James\nhave. There are those who were\naround in '84, those who jumped\nonto the bandwagon in '89, those\nwho 'discovered' them when it\nlooked like they wouldn't be releasing anything else earlier this decade\nand, of course, those who thought\nthat Whiplash was James' first\nalbum.\nJames: The Best Of contains a list of the band's history, as you\nwould imagine. It's not chrono logi cal, though; expect to hear things\nlike the recent She's a Star and\nWaltzing Along nestled up alongside classics like Come Home and\nHow was it for You. It might be a strange way to package a compi la tion, but it works. It really is possible to see that the essential ingredient that makes the songs so good is present and correct in all of the\ntracks in the same way. Part of that\n'something' is singer Tim Booth's voice which was amongst one of\nthe strongest and most distinctive\naround when the band started up\nand this is still the case today.\nIf you are an old fan of James\nand you saw them through baggy\nback in '89, then you'll already have\nall of the songs that are on here and\nyou won't need me to tell you to go\nout and get it. This album is clearly\naimed at those generation of fans\nwho bought the last album and\nwant to get into the older stuff. Or\nthose who have heard Sit Down\nand decided that they rather liked\nit. Well, if this is you, then do get\nthe album, you won't be di sap pointed. If you don't fit into any of\nthe above categories but you have\nan open mind and want to experience a brief history of one of the\nbest bands to emerge from England\nin the last fifteen years, then give it\na listen. You'll love it. E3 Alok\nAfterglow\nWest Coast based guitar, bass and\ndrums trios will always be com pared to Nirvana. Unfortunately\nthis means that they always come across as watered down. You can't deny that the energy\nand spirit are still present, as well\nas the sombre storytelling style\nwith Everclear. Check out the\nbonus track, Hating You for\nChristmas, which tells a tale of\nbeing dumped at Christmas time.\nJolly stuff, eh? What seems to be\nplaying truant is the raw emotional\nspark. For something that's supposed to be punk y and aggression-fuelled, you feel like they got bored\nand rattled this song off during\ntheir sleep.\nHowever, there are revealing\nhigh points, in that they are the\ninstrumentals. Media Intro is sampled from a60's movie about antidepressants but it's El Distorto De\nMelodica which is the gem. It's a cacophony of over am ped guitars\nand screaming voices and is a cross between Primal Scream and\nThe Sex Pistols. The problem is that\nthese tracks are the odd ones out.\nMaybe next time Everclear will\nchurn out an interesting alternative\nrecord with weird noises and haunting harmonies. However, I feel they might be too far down the\npunk grunge trio line to extricate\nthemselves fully. Dennis\nLIOIMROCK\nCity Delirious * * * *\nCity Delirious is Lionrock's second\nalbum and it's nothing short of\nsuperb. There's a mix of instrumentals and lyrical tunes, but it's the\noverall production of the music\nthat really allows the music to gel.\nWe're treated with a mix of\nrhythms and beats, with live guitars\nand off key basslines, forever looping in on each other.\nThe first single to be released\nfrom this album is the triumphant\nRude Boy Rock. With a pumping bassline and a catchy brass section\nlead, Lionrock have placed their\nproverbial paw well in the court of\npop. One would assume that any\ndreams of pop stardom rely heavily on this being accepted by the\nmass populous, and from the saturation radio play it has achieved\nthis seems inevitable.\nLive drums and guitars, p key part in the brilliantly TS\nElectric Hairdo, as the diversity of\nthe instruments used seems to\nincrease with every track. A problem often encountered when faced\nwith such a mind blowing array of\ninstruments is what to actually\nkeep your ears tuned to, but as\nLionrock keep things simple with\nperfect pop structure there is no\nsuch problem.\nThe title track, City Delirious,\nbrings us vocals in the form of the\nsemi-rap, semi-singing style of the\nStereo MC's in such a catchy way\nthat allows us to forgive them any\nlack of lyricism that may exist.\nIndeed the voice adds such quality\nto the sound, it wouldn't matter in\nthe lyrics were in Esperanto.\nOverall, a wonderful album that\nkeeps your foot tapping from\nbeginning to end.\nJames\nTORTOISE\nTNT\nIt's a jazzy thing and it sweeps you\nalong with the trumpets cutting in\nlike rust ip gi^ gold -iff peace and\nyou car/feel Hie fip f gfr tips on the\nstrings /and th*e p/ushed on the\nbongo? as wee jia sweep and the\nwhole thing hangs tp get her somehow air fi>p ll so%|d; iW n the road on\nwheel:, ck f[ bass* jj it j't;^f bd at it's at hob bih g|m el4f i/f hj c#{4^^|d stumbles when Jmk chords- lump\nout fro Vibe hi ha'M j and cha!

You,\nfor reasons unexplained, have\nbeen given twelve apparently\nidentical balls. One of the dozen, however, has gone rogue. It has a ever so slightly different weight\nthan its uniform brethren. Your\nmission, should you choose to\naccept it, is to determine which is\nthe errant sphere, and also fath-om whether the ball is heavier or\nlighter than its contemporaries.\nTo aid you in your quest, you have the use of a pair of common or garden scales. The catch, and\nthere always is a catch, is that\nyou can use the balance only\nthree times. It can be done, I promise... Mr.Trout\nCheeky Mr. Thomson gave you an insoluble puzzle last time;\nprovided you are limited to two dimensions you cannot connect up the houses. The smart arse who felt fit to inform us of\nthis fact was a Miss Janet Evans. I bet you won't get this\nweek's though. Bring ' em on, 1 prefer a straight fight...etc...\nMail or e mail your answers to the Felix office (felix@ic.ac.uk). If correct your name will be printed in not a large blaze of glory next issue.\nContributions of similar logic / maths puzzles gratefully received.\nEditorial ONLY A DROP\nThis week most of us are looking\nforward to the end of term, going\nhome and settling down to four\nweeks of uninterrupted revision.\nFor the Felix Office, however, it will\nbe a trying and difficult month.\nJeremy's arrest has left us without\na full time editor and mentor.\nWhilst us few remaining in the\noffice will of course try our best, we\nwould appreciate any aid that our\nreaders could provide in this most\ntesting time. It is a testament to\nthe skill and dedication of the\nremaining staff that we managed to\ncomplete this issue. Well done to\nall of you. We wish Jeremy and his\nfamily the best of luck and pray\nthat he can beat this terrible and\nfalse slur against his good name.\nHoward Marks is holding on page\nthree.\nDRUGS, OFFICER?\nThis brings us on to the\nIndependent on Sunday's ma\nthis Saturday in Hyde Park (page\nthree). The cannabis issue has\nbeen discussed in Felix on several\noccasions, not least by my predecessor (alas, poor Jeremy...). For\nmy part I hope the demonstration\npasses peacefully and is not\nhijacked by people just there for a laugh. This is a serious issue, and I would urge any students going on\nSaturday not to do anything that\nwould reflect badly on the campaign. Having said that, I 'll see you\nthere, and I 'll be smiling.\nIT'S NOT CRICKET! BREASTS\nAs terrible as Jeremy's arrest is, an\neven greater horror has entered my\nlife in the last few days. Iam refer-ring, of course, to the West Indian\nbowlers. It appears that nothing\nshort of a brick wall can stop their\nmerciless attack on England's bats-men. And even the wall might not\nwork. It seems only a few weeks\nsince England strode victorious off\nthe field ['Thought for the Day',\nFelix I108] hang on, it is only a few weeks! Exactly what have Mr Atherton and his motley crew been\nup to in the intervening period? 1\nreckon that Phil Tufnell has taken\nthe team on an excursion into the\ncountryside, perhaps with one of\nthose hand-rolled cigarettes\nIn Jeremy's absence, we would like\nto take the opportunity to redress\nthe balance. It is a sad fact that\nFelix has printed no breasts what-so ever, despite including seventeen male behinds and at least\nthree penises. Without in any way\nquestioning Jeremy's sexuality, we\nhave decided to print this picture\nof two colossal w abs. Small Adsl l NIO TE!
