    "content": "FRIDAY 4TH FEBRUARY 2022\n21\nBOOKS\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWhy do scientists do science? Are they self-inter-ested people seeking to print their names into\nhistory books, or are they selfless heroes hoping to better the world without seeking rewards?\nAt Imperial, many of us will choose the career of \u2018scientist\u2019. From what we learned as young children, scientists from Galileo seeking\nto understand the rules of\ngravity to Darwin trying\nto explain the evolution\nof species are always portrayed as being at the frontiers of humankind\u2019s pro-gress. But as we step into\nthis field and follow in the\nfootsteps of those scientific giants, we will gradually\nrealise this seldom-mentionedfact:\u201cscienceisalargelyanonymousprocess\u201d.As\nstated in the book, few scientists will be recognised for\ntheir work, and only a limited proportion of those few\nnotable scientists will continue to be remembered over\ngenerations. We will also gradually realise the unfair\nfact that scientists generally don\u2019t earn much money,\nwhich partly explains why so many potential physicists,\nchemists, and biologists eventually choose to be bank-ers. So why should some of us still aim to be scientists,\nwhen the rewards seem few and far between?\nThe book starts with the comparison between \u201ccommon sense\u201d and scientific thinking, of which the latter\nis often considered \u201ccounter-intuitive and unexpected\u201d\nfor non-trained minds; an example being \u201cthe natural\nstate for an object is to move at a constant speed\u2014not,\nas most of us think, to be stationary\u201d. The opening\nchapter introduces one of the most interesting questions in the book: why don\u2019t common people understand science?\nIt\u2019s interesting to see the author argue that most\n\u201cuseful\u201d tasks in our daily life do not need knowledge\nof science - riding a bike, for example, doesn\u2019t require\nunderstanding of Newton\u2019s Laws.\nThe following chapters introduced some even more\ninteresting topics. In Technology is not Science and\nThales\u2019s Leap: West and East, the author explains why\nscience emerged in Europe not in other civilisations.\nThe discussion in these two chapters reminds me of a\nbook called Science, the Endless Frontier by Vannevar\nBush; a collection of letters presented to US President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt that is believed to lay the foundation for the prosperity of science in America after\nWorld War II. One of the main themes of the letters\nis the distinction between technology and science, and the call\nfor stronger support of basic\nresearch. The difference in emphasis on science and technology from country to country\nunderlies the disparities in scientific development from historical times up to present day.\nTechnology, such as the development of such products as cell\nphones, air-conditioners, and\ncars, often has a direct impact on people\u2019s lives, while\nscience seemingly has nothing to do with daily life: for\nexample,theidentificationofanimportantproteinthat\nconnects endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis thaliana under biotic stress seems\nto have no connection with agriculture. That\u2019s why\nmany societies value\ntechnology over sci-ence, which often requires a huge amount\nof investment while\nseldom catering to\nreal practical needs.\nBut, as this book\npoints out, great leaps\nin technology often\nrely on the gradual\naccumulation of scientific knowledge.\nLater chapters of the book focus on elements of science such as creativity, competition, cooperation, and\nphilosophy. It\u2019s interesting to find out that even accomplished scientists, such as Nobel Laureate Dr Roger\nWolcottSperry,mustcontestsohardtogetpaperspublished ahead of others in their field, and how scientists\nhave to balance intense competition with the need for\ncooperation. This book serves as a valuable reference\npoint for a scientists\u2019 life for people seeking a career in\nscience.\nT h e\nnarrative\nstyle of\nthe book\nis highly\ncritica l.\nT h o u g h\ncountless\nq u o t a -tions from\nexceptional scientists and\nphilosophers were\ncited, few\nsur vived\nthe fierce\nattacks of the author. It may seem that the author\u2019s ideas are incompatible and at odds with each other, but\nthrough reading the ceaseless arguments, the reader\nwill gradually understand the critical nature of science\nand subconsciously try to refute the author in the way\nthe author criticises other people. I believe\nthis to be one of the aims the author hoped\nreaders to achieve through reading this\nbook.\nEven for non-scientists, reading the\nbook will help to correct their misunderstandings of science and inspire them to\nthink more scientifically. Readers will be\nsurprised to discover how headlines may\nmislead the public, and how unsubstantiated data can be arbitrarily interpreted in\nways that influence our lives, especially in cases such as\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cSciencecanbequiteuncomfortabletolivewith\u2013at\nleast for some people. It offers no hope for an afterlife,\nit tolerates no magic, and it doesn\u2019t tell us how to live.\nBut there is no good reason to believe\u2026that scientific\nunderstanding creates a \u2018dry and sterile world\u2019 by apparentlyremovingallmystery\u2026andscienceitselfcanbe\nvery beautiful.\u201d - Lewis Wolpert\nWhy Do Scientists Do Science?\nBook Article\nRuntian Wu Books Writer\nBook: The Unnatural Nature of Science\nAuthor: Lewis Wolpert\n\u201c\nWHY SHOULD SOME\nOF US STILL AIM TO BE\nSCIENTISTS, WHEN THE\nREWARDS SEEM FEW\nAND FAR BETWEEN?\n\u201c\nSCIENTISTS HAVE TO\nBALANCE INTENSE\nCOMPETITION\nWITH THE NEED FOR\nCOOPERATION\n\n"

Caf\u00e9 Kitsun\u00e9\nis a stylish spot in Belgravia that has quite the boutique\nfeeling in the air, it\u2019s around a 16-minute bus journey\nfrom Imperial College \u2014 so it\u2019s perfect to attend if you\nhaveafewhourstospareintheafternoonbyyourselfor\nwith some friends. The caf\u00e9 serves a fusion of French &\nJapanese confectionery, coffee and cocktails and has its\ngrass roots all the way back to Tokyo, Japan.\nCaf\u00e9Kitsun\u00e9isoneofthefourcaf\u00e9/restaurantsavailable in the Pantechnicon venue which combines both\nNordic and Japanese cultures together. It\u2019s located on\nthe first and second floor of the building. The first floor\nis mainly for ordering and paying, with a joint outdoor\nseating used by all establishments within the building.\nThe first floor is also connected to Pantechnicon\u2019s own\nstore with the second floor for seating. The interior is\nalso very chic and clean to suit the location it is in and\nlights are dimmed throughout the floors, making it feel\ncomfy and warm during a cold afternoon. Although,\nthe dim lights do make it hard to take an aesthetically\npleasing picture which could be an issue if you\u2019re looking to take nice pictures.\nCaf\u00e9 Kitsun\u00e9 has a variety of popular dishes that\nthey serve, although it is a caf\u00e9 with a larger selection of\ndrinks rather than food. The Japanese style sandwiches\n(sandos) are amongst the most popular dishes served,\nnotably the Chicken Katsu & Egg Sando. They also\nserve breakfast (after 8:30am) and evening (after 5pm)\nspecial dishes as well, with the sandos only being available after 12pm.\nFor drinks they serve a range of beverages, ready for\nwhatever mood you\u2019re in. This could be your typical\nnon-alcoholic beverage that is either hot or cold, such\nas:coffee,teas&infusionsorcoldpressedjuiceslikeor-ange & sea buckthorn and their speciality cold drinks\nlikeicedmatchalatteoricedyuzu&honey.Althougha\ncaf\u00e9,theyalsoservealcoholsuchassake,wine,beerand\ncocktails to name a few.\nWe began our Caf\u00e9 Kitsun\u00e9 tasting session by ordering the Egg and Chicken Katsu Sando which was\nserved in a cute brown Caf\u00e9 Kitsun\u00e9 logo box. The\nsandwiches were served with the crusts cut out, and the\nslices were thick, holding the contents of the sando\u2019s\nnicely together.\nJust from the first glance of the egg sando, the sand-wichlookedsoftandfluffy,witheachslicecomingwith\nhalf a soft boiled egg inside as well. The eggs are served\ncold and flavourwise, the sando is quite standard and\nplain. The mayonnaise and egg were quite obviously\nthe only components in the sandwich, but this wasn\u2019t\nnecessarily a bad thing; I enjoyed each bite due to the\nfullness. All in all, for the price (\u00a37.00), even despite\nthe lack of flavour, I wouldn\u2019t say I was disappointed.\nYou\u2019re not only paying for the taste but the presentation of the sando itself. The next sando we got was the\nChicken Katsu Sando and being an avid katsu curry\nfan, I was really looking forward to what the Chicken\nKatsuSandoisabout.WhenIsetmyeyesonthesando,\nI saw what my life could have been after a single bite, I\nhad very high hopes for it - could have opened my third\neye.WithallthisexcitementbuiltupIwentformyfirst\nbite. I then understood what the sandwich was about\nin its entirety. I found it very standard and potentially\neven a bit disappointing given the price tag that came\nalong with it (\u00a39.00). The sandwich bread was nice and\nspongy holding everything together and the chicken\nkatsu was very thick and coated with a sweet sauce and\niceberg lettuce on top. However, I expected the sandwich to be hot and freshly made, but it was apparent\nthat that wasn\u2019t the case. Since the sandwich wasn\u2019t\nfreshly prepared ,I found the breast dry and the combination of the bread with it did not help the situation\n- which could have been avoided if it was freshly made\nwhen ordered. Furthermore, there was not enough\nsauce provided for the amount of chicken and bread\nthat came along with it. All in all, I found the sandwich\nstandard and quite dry and I did not think the \u00a39 price\nFRIDAY 4TH JANUARY 2022\n22 Food.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCafe Kitsune - A French & Japanese\nFusion\nRestaurant Review\nReviewed by Bencan Yalcin Food Editor\nPricerange: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\nSignaturedishes: EggSando&Paris-Brest\nStyle: Casual\nEdited by: Bencan Yalcin\nFood\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nPhoto credits: Melis Efecan\nEgg Sando\nHazelnut, Bannana & Yuzu Paris-Brest on the left and the seasonal dessert Mont Blanc on the right\n\n"

As you\u2019ll\nnote from the News story on this, four\nout of five graduates never pay back\ntheir loan, meaning a proportion of\nthe cost to them of going to university\nis shouldered by the taxpayer. The\nvalue of your \u201cdebt\u201d as a graduate has\nno effect on how much you pay back,\nwhich is not the case for almost every\nother type of loan. For example, as\nMartin Lewis puts it, if the tuition fee\ncap rose to \u00a31 million a year, and you\nhad accrued a \u00a33 million\ndebt by the end of your\nbachealors, you would\nstill only pay back 9%\nof everything you earn\nover the threshold. This,\nobviously, is massive\nstep forward in terms of\nequity, as those who come\nfrompoorerbackgroundsand\nhave taken out loans totalling close to\n\u00a370,000 pay back the same amount\nper payslip as those from richer\nfamilies who may only have loans\nto the value of \u00a327,000 or even less.\nFurthermore, there is the value\nimparted by most degrees on their\nrecipients.Iwouldnothavethisjobhad\nI not come to university, and graduate\nvs non-graduate earnings across the\ncountry reflect the clear benefit that\na degree has on salary expectations.\nThat being said, graduate-filled roles\nalso largely benefit the economy\nand the country as a whole, leaving\nthe Augar report panel to the\nconclusion that \u201cthe cost of post-18\neducation should be shared between\ntaxpayers, employers and learners\u201d.\nThis freeze does represent a real-terms cut to a graduate\u2019s pay packet,\nbut it is a tiny one, and one they\ncan probably afford due to their\nstatistically higher salaries in the first\nplace. What\u2019s more, the threshold\nis so far above the living wage that\nit\u2019s almost offensive to talk about\nchildless, single people (which new\ngraduates largely are) on around\n\u00a330,000 a year as if they\u2019re the crux of\nthis whole \u201csqueeze\u201d matter anyway.\nStudent Loans\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

It is a completely\nstudent-led initiative,\nand aims to remain an\nevent created by stu-dents, for students. It\nhas proven to be a great\nsuccess in previous\nyears with hundreds of\nspectators attending\nto witness both men\u2019s\nand women\u2019s game and the trophies - JP\nMorgan Shield and the Rees Rawlings\nCup \u2013 being awarded. Started in 2017\nto support Matt Hampson foundation,\nthe event proved most popular among\nthe students of both Imperial and LSE,\nattracting almost 1000 spectators every\nyear.

For the womens squad the\nimportance of this event is clear. Varsity\nis the most exciting match of the year for\nImperial Women\u2019s Rugby! I think what\nmakes it so special is being able to invite\nfriends and family to come and support\nus, which really brings a special energy\nto the game. I think it\u2019s also a really great\ngame for our new players to realise how\nmuch they\u2019ve grown during their first\nseason of rugby and it\u2019s amazing to be\nable to see the confidence they\u2019ve gained\nin such a short time.

Against\nits Albuquerque, New Mexico backdrop, it would turn\nout that drug-dealing is in fact a mundane ordeal of\nledger sheets and corporate secrets, which the agitated\nJesse Pinkman sees as \u201ctotally Kafkaesque \u2014majorly!\u201d.\nThe word stands on the precipice of being relegated\nas a mere synonym for things that are off-putting, or\npeculiar, or sardonic, or frankly just strange \u2014 which,\nwhen put together, are all technically true of the word.\nFrom the Michael Hofmann-translated copy of Metamorphosis and Other Stories, a collection of the bodies\nofworkoftheCzech-bornFranzKafka,TheJudgement,\nas fiction, reads upfront as off-putting; Absent-Minded\nWindow Gazing as peculiar; Resolutions as sardonic;\nand Eleven Sons as strange. Yet in any of these examples he is never just one, or all of these qualities at once.\nKafka\u2019s essence touches on capricious, in the way he \u2014\nin ten or in a thousand words \u2014 construes prose that\nis capable of poking at life\u2019s fabric, delivering stories\nthatareplainlypoignant,orlaugh-out-loudhilarious,\nboth, or boldly neither.\nAnd in truth, the perfect portrait of him and all\nthings Kafkaesque does not lie merely in the text, but\nin the questions that he conjures up, via his storytell-ing, for the mind to dwell on. Consider Metamorphosis, his most renowned work, where Kafka begins\nwith a simple central question:\nIf tomorrow morning you\nwoke up as a cockroach \u2014 what\nthen?\nThe notorious tale of a travelling salesman-turned-vermin\n(depending on the from-Ger-man translation) is as much\nabout the situational comedy of Gregor Samsa having\nto manage six limbs as it is the manner in which his\nworld first collapses, and subsequently rebuilds, albeit around him. Suddenly the absurd premise of the\nstory goes from asking \u2018How does one eat breakfast\nwith mandibles?\u2019 to \u2018How does the world adapt to\nmisfortune, and if it cannot, how quickly does it then\nmove on?\u2019.\nSimilarly, the double billing of Unmasking of a Confidence Trickster and\nThe Stoker both take\non the utter nakedness that is moving\nto another country,\nasking us \u2018How on\nearth do we as people build trust?\u2019 and\n\u2018What exactly is that\ntrust is composed\nof?\u2019. The paths of the\nprotagonists in both\nthese titles are marked and marred by mad-cap encounters with eccentric characters that all feel London-adjacent, but Kafka busies himself with foraging into the\nrelatable strangeness, beauty, and unexpectedness in\nthe experience of moving countries.\nHowever, Kafka shines brightest as a sketch artist of\nlife.\nTrees is just 45 words long. Yet, with a setting reminiscent of Hyde Park, he is able to illustrate trees as\nmetaphors for the sometimes sound, sometimes unsound nature of our minds, and questions when, if\never, we can know people are okay.\nTherefore, the temptation to see Kafka\u2019s work only\nfor its melancholia is always present. In Resolutions,\nwhich holds equal punch and almost equal brevity as\nthe aforementioned Trees, another nameless protagonist remarks on the nature of life within the context of\nthe many challenges it presents.

The College\nadded a note to say that this comment\nwas made by an ex-member of staff.\nOn another matter, which involved\na greivance so strong that the offending\npartyhadofferedtoresign,Muirsuggested\nthat the complainant and offender\ngo for lunch in order to \u201ciron it out\u201d.\nHe is also quoted as having used\nthe phrase \u201cleaving the plantation\u201d,\nthough there is no context to this.\nIn strange contrast, the report\nnotes \u201cI was impressed by the many\npositive things said about\u201d Muir.\nCulture\nIt is very difficult to read the report as\na whole due to the massive amount\nof redacted detail. Points made in\nthe reasoning appear at many times\ncontradictory to the conclusions stated.\nDespite a conclusion of the report\nbeing \u201cmy findings do not enable me\nto conclude that there is a culture of\nbullying at the College\u201d, it is added that\n\u201cAGandMShavecreatedorcontributed\nto a culture which involves and tolerates\nfavouritism, exclusion, the making of\ndisparaging comments about others\nand at times a lack of respect for others\u201d.\n\u201cthe College demands and\nassumes excellence but is less good at\nrewarding and recognising excellence\u201d\nThe report highlights that in some\naspects the College suffers from a\nculture of disparaging behaviour, as\nopposed to acts solely committed\nby Alice and Muir. One example\nhighlighted in the report is \u201cIt was\nstriking that within hours of MS (Muir)\nsaying that [REDACTED] should\n\u201cgrow a backbone\u201d, [REDACTED] was\ncommenting that [REDACTED] had\n\u201cnotshownalotofbackbone\u201d,emulating\nbehaviours demonstrated by MS.\u201d\nSeveral comments made to the\ninvestigator suggest favouritism based\non personal preference of the senior\nleadership rather than competency in\ntheir role. On nominating members\nof a group referred to as \u2018Silver\u2019 in the\nreport, it was said that \u201cthe selection\nwas not entirely objective. There was\nno very satisfactory explanation for the\nselection of individuals that was made\u201d.\nThere was also concern raised over\nthe distribution of power within\nthe College\u2019s leadership. The report\ndescribes Muir as \u2018de facto COO\u2019 as\nwell as CFO, and adds that \u201cI have\nreferred to the perceived problem of\npower being centred in two or three\nindividuals at the College and the\nexclusion from the decision-making\nprocess of those who should be included\nin the interests of good governance\u201d.\n\u201cAt the most senior level of the\nCollege, there is a culture of making\ndisparaging comments about others\nwho are absent and tolerating the\nmaking of such comments by others\u201d\nImperial College Union said\n\u201cAlongside the specific incidents of\nbullying referred to, the report paints\na picture of a culture at the top of the\ninstitution without empathy, in which\nexclusionanddisrespectarepracticedand\nencouraged by the most senior leaders.\nThere will be many reading this\nreport who see reflections of their\nown experiences, and who will rightly\nconnect the most negative aspects of\nthe culture throughout the College\nFRIDAY 4TH FEBRUARY 2022\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBullying report...\nNEWS\nCredit: Imperial College London\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nWe are killing the cure for cancer\nCancer is still a very hard disease to\ncure despite the current extensive\nresearch being carried out to investigate\nit from different angles. Around 60%\nof cancer drugs have a natural origin.\nMany of these come from marine inver-tebrates, which have huge biochemical\ndiversity. So, there are potentially more\nanti-cancer chemicals to be discovered\nin these organisms. The reason why the\nchemicals of marine invertebrates can\ndestroy malignant cells is that these\nchemicals have cytotoxic properties (i.e.\nare toxic for cells). This evolved through\nnatural selection. Marine invertebrates\nlive in environments infested with pathogenic microorganisms such as fungi\nand bacteria that they need to continu-aly fight. Some marine invertebrates like\nsea cucumbers do not have protective\nexoskeletons, so they are more exposed\nto these pathogens. Sea cucumbers have\nthus been forced to develop and improve their biochemical arsenal.\nUndoubtedly, the sea cucumber is\nthe marine invertebrate with the largest\npotential for the discovery of cancer\ntreatments due to the genetic diversity\nof these \u201cplant-like\u201d animals. They are\nrich in various molecules that are not\nproduced in the human body and are\nvery hard to synthesise in laboratories.\nChemicals such as frondoside A and tri-terpene glycosides, have already shown\npromising results when tested on a large\narray of human cell lines. These compounds have proven to have anti-tumor-al and anti-oxidant properties, amongst\nothers. For this reason, sea cucumbers\nhave been a delicacy in Asian civilisations for centuries, and are often termed\nthe \u201cginseng of the sea\u201d (ginseng is a\nplant root with many healing proper-ties).\nFrondoside A has growing relevance\nin the fight against cancer. This very\ncomplex molecule is extracted from the\nsea cucumber Cucumaria frondose. Research with mice has shown that fron-doside A is effective in curing both lung\nand pancreatic cancers. In addition, the\ndosed-frondoside A mice attained more\nprotection against bacterial infection,\nas well as increasing activity in mac-rophages. These are immune cells that\n\u201ceat\u201d harmful agents such as bacteria or\ncancer cells. The applications of frondo-side A in breast and hormonal-related\ncancers is also under study. There are\nfour core effects of frondoside A that\nmake it such a good anti-cancer agent.\nFirst, it inhibits cell division, which is\nkey in stopping the growth of tumours\nbecause cancer is essentially the uncontrolled division of dysfunctional cells.\nSecond, it simultaneously activates ap-optosis, which is the programmed death\nof cells that have suffered DNA damage\nor been invaded by pathogens, in order\nto avoid infecting the surrounding cells.\nThird, it prevents the spread of cancer\ncells to other tissues and organs of the\nbody. Fourth, as malignant tumours\ngrow very fast, they need higher supplies of food and oxygen. Consequently,\nthey start forming blood vessels that\nconnect with the main bloodstream to\nuptake more nutrients. This process is\ncalled angiogenesis and frondoside A\nprecisely inhibits it, causing the starvation of the malignant tumours. All in\nall, frondoside A is capable of preventing the further development of cancer\ncells and killing them directly.\nAnother \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of natural\nanti-cancer agents are triterpene glycosides which are synthesised, again,\nby sea cucumbers. They have cytotoxic\nproperties that are effective against fun-gi, bacteria, and other living cells. Sea\ncucumbers employ these chemical compounds both to deter predators and to\nattack pathogens. Triterpene glycosides\ncreate channels in cell membranes that\nalter the internal chemical composition\nof the cell, causing its death. Several investigations conducted in rodents have\ndemonstrated that triterpene glycosides\nare able to diminish tumour growth and\nspread.\nHowever, there are two main disadvantages to using sea cucumbers\u2019\nchemicals for cancer treatment. Firstly,\nfrondoside A is hard to test in clinical\ntrials with humans because the chemical\ncompound is inactive if ingested orally.\nThe other methods of administration\nare intravenous and abdominal, which\nactivate frondiside A but are more\ninvasive and therefore require a precise\ncalculation of the doses and a thorough\nrisk assessment. Secondly, the increasing\nusage of anti-cancer drugs from sea cucumber might drive these animals to the\nbrink of extinction. Not only are their\npopulations diminishing due to fishing,\nbut climate change is destroying their\nnatural habitats. From a pharmaceutical point of view, investing in cancer\ndrugs derived from sea cucumbers is not\nsustainable in the long-term unless we\ncan synthesise the chemical compounds\nartificially. However, chemical compounds like frondoside A are extremely\ndifficult to synthesise because of their\nsize and chemical bonds.\nIn conclusion, cancer is a dire disease with no definitive cure despite\nthe decades of research dedicated to it.\nThe solution could be in the amazing\nbiochemical diversity of marine life ,\nwhich has already given positive results\nin cancer treatment. However, human\nactivity is putting our oceans in danger,\nalongside the cure for cancer.\nWang Guo Science Writer\nMarine invertebrates may hold the key to developing effective cancer treatments, but we are reducing their\npopulations\nCucumaria frondosa\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons (Eric A.

    "content": "If there\u2019s anything I can promise, it\u2019s that my account of the second Open Mic event to grace the\nUnion this year will be very little like the first. I can\u2019t\npromise, however, that the members of Live Music\nSociety will respond favourably to this article. So, as a\npreface, I\u2019d like to say that I still highly encourage you\nto attend these events, support Imperial\u2019s bands, the\nmembers of LMS who work so hard to put these to-gether, and the staff at the Union who cater to boozy\nstudents seated at the time of the event.\nThere\u2019s a reason I hesitate to call these students\n\u201caudience members\u201d; I don\u2019t think they really\nintended to be there during the performance. And\nI can\u2019t blame them. Metric had the same royal blue\nclub environment, picnic bench set-up, and screen\nbehind the stage displaying what looked like Excel bar\ngraphs having a seizure (or as Yunke eloquently put\nit \u2013 a malfunctioning 2005 Tetris game). Last thing\nyou\u2019d expect is an LMS\nevent promising relaxing\nacoustics and the classic\nwide-eyed guitar player\nand stool combo. Yes,\ntherewasmorespacethan\nbefore (which is a definite\nplus point because\nrelaxing acoustics and\nunhappy security guards\npresent an incongruent\nduo). But I must admit it\nwas a bit of a let-down for\nthose of us who came for\nour dose of vibey folk-pop.\nThe night began with an unexpected hip-hop/\nrap act. Although it was hard to discern what the\nperformer was saying in the middle of the chaos\n(thanks to the accidental \u201caudience members\u201d),\nanyone with ears could tell he was definitely skilled.\nHe set up his backing track on a MacBook and placed\nit on a nest of wires before he began his performance.\nSome verses were slow and measured while some were\nsped through with impressive clarity. The interjection\nof a comedic sequence involving a virtual assistant\u2019s\nvoiceover telling him his fly was open derailed the act\na bit, but who knows? It may have a received a laugh or\ntwo if anyone could hear him.\nA performance of Bastille\u2019s \u201cPompeii\u201d invited just a\nlittlemoreaudienceengagement,butwasstillgenerally\ninaudible. This improved when an initially timid\nvocal performance of Sam Smith\u2019s \u201cLay Me Down\u201d\ncrescendoed as the singer became more confident.\nHowever, it peaked when LMS crowd favourite Man\nHo, the local Mandopop tribute artist, channelled Jay\nChou\u2019s romantic \u201cQ\u012bn Hua C\u012b\u201d (or \u201cBlue and White\nPorcelain\u201d) while daintily holding a rose.\nAnother surprising performance was Pralaya,\nImperial\u2019s own prog metal band, who sang their\nfavourites with only an acoustic guitar and caj\u00f3n (a\nPeruvian box you sit and drum on). This included\na toned down version of Foo Fighters\u2019 \u201cEverlong\u201d\n\u2013 a highly evocative song when sung with genuine\nemotion. And if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learnt about\nPralaya, having watched them for months now, it\u2019s that\nthey\u2019re heavily invested in their love of metal (a genre\nI\u2019m not a fan of but can definitely still appreciate).\nAs I\u2019d come to realise, I judge these nights against a\nset of standards that don\u2019t really stay the same through\nthe performance. Sure, they begin with judging \u2018talent\u2019,\n\u2018skill\u2019,\u2018passion\u2019andallthat\nmusical mumbo jumbo.\nUltimately, they end\nwith how much fun we\u2019re\nhaving as both audience\nmembersandperformers.\nAre we enjoying the\nmusic? Is my little\nnotebook where I write\nabout each performance\nfinally shut and stuffed\ninto a bag somewhere?\nThese are things that tell\nme I had a good time.\nBut tonight answered those\nquestions differently compared to when I normally\nattend these events. Some impromptu performances\nof \u201cCloser\u201d and \u201cAll of Me\u201d reminded me it was getting\nlate and I had a bed to sleep on. I wondered why the\nsingers (a broad definition of the word) needed to\npull out lyrics to the most overplayed pop songs in\nmusic history. In fact, most LMS events actually steer\nrelatively clear of this redundancy to a certain degree.\nBut something about tonight didn\u2019t feel like an LMS\nevent. The audience made performers feel alienated\nbecause they would only get a cheer if their song was\nincredibly mainstream. The event felt more like an\nadvertisement for noisy, attention-seeking friend\ngroups, than actual performances. While this seems\nquite harmless, it could have been a major deal breaker\nfor first-time performers \u2013 and after all, that\u2019s the point\nof an open mic night.\n18 Music.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Rosie Millns\nTara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nAlbum of the Week:\nThe Overload by Yard\nAct\nLeeds-based post\npunk outfit\nYard Act have\nbroken into the\nmainstream with\ntheir debut album\nThe Overload.\nAfter a tense chart race involving\neverything from summoning circles\nto celebrity endorsement the album\nended up at number 2, narrowly\nmissing out on the top spot.\nView online here!\nLynks revealed \u201cI wrote\n\u2018Silly Boy\u2019 when I was\nreally fucking pissed off\nwith one very specific\nman... he represented\nevery entitled, space-absorbing, toxic\nstraight man I had ever\nmet.\u201d The anger that the track is built on attacks\nthis toxic masculinity \u2013 \u201cthe kind of man who\nsnaps his fingers at bartenders ... with the toxic\nconfidence that comes from never being told that\nhis point of view might not be valid\u201d, Lynks said.\nThe track kills this toxic confidence flips it on its\nhead, and just for good measure stamps it into the\nground to end it for good.\n\u201cSilly Boy\u201d by Lynks\nSingleoftheWeek\nOpen Mic 2: Surely You Know\nThe Words To \u201cAll Of Me\u201d?\nWritten by Tara Pal Chaudhuri Music Editor\nGig Reviews\nToday in Music History\nImagine, it\u2019s\n2007, you\u2019re in\nFlorida at the\nSuperbowl and\nits tipping it\ndown.

The industry usually excludes\n9% of the population before a product\neven hits the shelves, simply because\nusing the device is far too complicated.\nTo produce truly accessible products,\ncompanies must give users the time\nand aid necessary for them to come to\ngrips with the technology they do not\nrecognise.\nThink about how you place a\nWhatsApp video call. For most of us,\nthis action has become second nature. A\nfew months ago, however, I was teaching my grandmother, and I realized\nhow complicated it is: open WhatsApp,\nthen go to Calls, then to the little green\nbutton that means contacts, then scroll\nand find the person you want to call,\nthen press the little camera icon. This\nalone is a long-winded process, but it\nbecomes more onerous when you have\ncalled the person before, then different again when you\u2019ve messaged them\nbefore. I only ended up teaching her the\nfirst version; the rest would only create\nmore confusion. Nevertheless, this little\nepisode made something clear to me: all\nthe shortcuts that exist to make using a\ndevice easier accomplish their function\nfor many, but there is still a significant\nproportion for whom such shortcuts\nonly create further complications.\nRote learning is one of the most\neffective methods of learning, whereby\na person learns the steps of a process\nby continually repeating them until\nmemorised. This is particularly true\nfor the present generation of the elderly population, whose own education\nhad its foundations in rote learning.\nTherefore, it is no surprise that this will\nbe how they can best learn how to use\ntechnology: repeating the actions over\nand over until they are firmly ingrained.\nHowever, much as the physical body\ndeclines in old age, so does the ability\nto memorise information. 40% of over\n65s suffer from age-related memory\nissues. While they are not always as\nsevere as Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, a\nperson\u2019s ability to remember information is nevertheless impacted. In order\nto remember the process, it will take the\nelderly user far more than simply one\nattempt. However, most devices only\nprovide instruction once, and only for\nthe device itself. Apps provide no aid at\nall. If tech companies do wish to open\ntheir products up to everybody, they\nmust be able to aid the users for as long\nas they need it.\nThere is a simple alternative to the problems\ncaused by memorisation\nof a method: having a\nwritten method. This is\nexactly how I taught my\ngrandmother the process\nof making WhatsApp\ncalls; I wrote out each\nstep and she carried a\nlittle piece of paper with\nher until she could remember it. So, while this\nis an obvious alternative,\nit poses its own prob-lems. With 49.6% of\nelderly people suffering\nfrom arthritis, writing\nout a method on a piece\nof paper is almost im-possible. The only clear\nsolution to this is to have\nsomebody else write it\nout for them, which, for\nmany, is not an option. There were 3.3\nmillion people over 70 years old living\nalone in 2019 in the UK, a figure which\nonly increased during the COVID-19\npandemic. While charities such as Age\nUK have programmes in which volunteers become \u201ctech buddies\u201d, this is not\nnearly as far-reaching as it needs to be.\nThe best solutions which can help the\nelderly to get to grips with technology\nare available to only a very slim part of\nthe population.\nMany people, especially of my gen-eration, will believe that this is only a\nproblem for now; the elderly people of\ntoday did not grow up with technology,\nwhereas we did. While this appears to\nbe a solid argument, there are holes in\nit. The phenomenon of feature creep\n(the tendency of products to become\nmore complicated over) means that the\ntechnology that will exist in 2080 will\nbear little resemblance to what we know\nnow, ensuring that we will be just as\nconfused as the current generation. It is\neasy to think that this problem will take\ncare of itself, but it would be a mistake\nof the industry to go on without changing\u2014 the issue of accessibility will not\nbe resolved without careful consideration and design\nWhat is the solution to this problem\nthen? Devices need to constantly be\ngiving user\u2019s options for the next move,\nthus providing them with aid for as long\nas they need. The lack of accessibility\nfor elderly people cannot simply be\nsolved by having larger text \u2013 though\nthis is still essential. Devices need to\ngive constant assistance to the user.\nBut how this assistance takes place can\nonly be decided once elderly users have\nbeen carefully observed, to see exactly\nhow they use and prefer to use a device.\nYoung users are frequently observed to\nensure that they have the best experience of technology (with valid reason;\nthey are the primary consumers) but it\nis time for tech companies to consider\ntheir whole market. Until then, technology will not be truly accessible to all.\nAnusha Narayan Science Writer\nThere is a growing need for computer and phone interfaces which account for the needs of the elderly population\nThe ageist nature of technology\nSCIENCE Edited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-SA-3.0\n\n"

    "content": "Scrapping green energy policies\nhas added \u00a32.5 billion to UK\nenergy bills\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nIn analysis done by investigative\npolicy-focused website Carbon Brief, it\nhas been found that the last ten years of\ncutting progressive energy policies have\nadded around \u00a32.5bn to energy bills in\nthe UK. These findings have come about\nalongside a rise in the energy price cap,\nwhich will increase energy bills by nearly\n50% - a change set to occur in April.\nIn the last decade, the Conservative\nGovernment has done much to stall the\nmove towards greener energy policy.\nThe potential changes that have been\nscrapped include getting rid of the\nzero-carbon homes standard, limiting\naccess to energy efficiency subsidies, and\nbanning onshore wind projects (a ban\nthat began to be lifted in 2020).\nThis news comes alongside a huge\nincrease in the price of gas in the UK\u2014\nfrom a ten-year low of \u00a313.18 in June\n2020, to \u00a3201.09 in November 2021.\nGaspriceshavebeenrelativelystableover\nthe last ten years, with slight peaks and\ntroughs. One such peak was in March\n2013, which was met with promises\nby then-Labour leader Ed Miliband to\ncap gas prices if he were to win the next\nelection. At the same time, the Sun was\nreporting on the then-prime minister\nDavid Cameron as promising to \u201cget rid\nof the green crap\u201d.\nTo ease this steep rise in the cost of\nenergy, the government is considering\ncutting VAT on energy bills and further\ncuts to energy efficiency policies.\nHowever, this is shortsighted, and\nrepresents the same kind of thinking\nthat has been utilised over the last\nten years\u2014thinking that has arguably\nbrought about such steep increases in\ncost alongside ensuring UK targets\nregarding climate are harder to meet.\nOne of the most harmful problems\nthese price increases cause is the upward\ntrend of families being put under what\nis known as \u2018fuel stress\u2019\u2014a term that\ndescribes families that are spending\nat least 10% of their overall budget\non energy bills. One think tank, the\nResolution Foundation, predicted that\nwhen the energy price cap changes in\nApril, the number of families suffering\nfrom fuel stress will triple almost\novernight to 6.3 million.\nSo the question is, would bills be\nlower if the \u2018green crap\u2019 had been kept?\nThedataisprettyclear;yes.Eventhough\nmaintaining climate policies comes\nat a worthwhile price, Carbon Brief\u2019s\nanalysis states that savings made would\nhave translated into \u00a340 reductions for\nhouseholds under today\u2019s price cap.\nBusiness and industry too would have\nbenefited, with savings of up to \u00a31bn.\nThese savings would have come from\nmany different locations. For example,\nif the government hadn\u2019t scrapped the\nzero-carbon homes standard, most\ncavity walls and lofts would now be\ninsulated, increasing energy efficiency\nand reducing prices. Onshore wind\nCfDs (Contracts for Difference - a type\nof subsidy in which the contractual\npartner is paid for deviations from a\nspecific reference price point), had\nthere not been a four-year ban, would\nrepresent a net saving on energy bills.\nThe increase in the UK energy price\ncap is being driven by the sharp increase\ninwholesalegaspricesaroundtheworld.\nThe distribution of fuel stress because\nof this is not uniform, with levels\nprojected to be highest in the north-east, and 33% of households suffering.\n38% of pensioner households will also\nfind themselves struggling to cope, with\nalmost half of over-65s stating they will\nhave to heat their homes less, according\nto the charity Age UK.\nIn analysis by Uswitch, the energy\nprice cap is set to rise from \u00a31,277 in\nNovember 2021 to \u00a31,897 in April\u2014a\n48% increase. The market researcher,\nCornwall Insight, further predicts that\nthe cap may rise again, hitting over\n\u00a32,000 in October this year.\nMany ask: what can be done to lower\nthebill?Well,thereareschemesrunning\ncurrently, such as the Warm Home\nDiscount,theWinterFuelPayment,and\nthe Cold Weather Payment. However,\nthese are not long-lasting solutions,\nand rather deal with the symptoms of\npolitical inadequacy, rather than the\nunderlying infrastructural problems.\nThe UK government needs to better\naddress its attitude towards green\nenergy policy if we want both warmer\nhomes and a greener climate, as the\nenergy cost savings that could have\ncome with green energy policies in place\nare simply being converted to higher\nbills today. Fortunately, we are living in a\nworld where \u2018green crap\u2019\u2014both in terms\nof policy and technological change\u2014\ncould be utilised to make our lives easier,\ncleaner, and less expensive.\nJack Cribb Environment Editor\nTHE NUMBER\nOF FAMILIES\nSUFFERING FROM\nFUEL STRESS WILL\nTRIPLE ALMOST\nOVERNIGHT\n\u201c\n\u2018Green crap\u2019 that would have saved us money...\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n10\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie Mori\nMonika Yardonova\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment View online here!\nNicholas Doherty, Unsplash\n\n"

These fungi\nshare the common characteristic\nof forming key symbiotic (benefi-cial) relationships with plants to\nprovide them with nutrients and\nwater in exchange for carbon in\nthe form of sugars. Professor Bidartondo has worked on a huge\nvariety of mycorrhizal fungi, from\nthe common arbuscular mycor-rhizae to orchid mycorrhizae,\nectomycorrhizae, and even the\nmycorrhiza-like associations of\nbryophytes (not fungi but liver-worts, hornworts, and mosses).\nHis current research is focusing\non the functions and ecology of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which form relationships\nwith the large, woody trees that make up our forests. With increasing pressure to\npreserve and regrow forests for carbon sequestration, the ectomycorrhizal fungi that\ndetermine their health will need special focus. This fungi has long been ignored by\nconservationists and ecologists, and therefore by policymakers, but their condition\nhas profound effects on the health of a forest. Professor Bidartondo\u2019s new paper\nlooks at the tipping points of ectomycorrhizal fungi. \u201cTipping point\u201d refers to the\npoint at which some environmental change that is detrimental to the fungi\u2019s survival\nreaches a threshold; beyond\nwhich it causes major impacts\nthat are tricky to reverse. If\nectomycorrhizae\u2019s health is\ncompromised, there could be\ndevastating consequences for\nthe trees they form symbiotic\nrelationships with. These consequences will directly affect\nkey functions that impact human wellbeing. For the sake of\ncarbon sequestration and mitigating climate change, mycorrhizal fungi will need specific attention and research.\nLuckily, it is increasingly being recognised that to protect\nplants, you have to protect the\nfungi that support them.\n`\nThis week in Science...\nInsights into lateral flow efficiency and COVID-19\nprogression\nDisparities in the treatment of rare high cholesterol disorder\nBlooming heck! Spring flowers now flowering one month\nearlier due to climate change, study finds\nThefirststudytomonitorafullcourseofCOVID-19hasbeenpublished.\n36 healthy, young participants with no immunity were exposed to COVID-19. The team found that for those infected, their symptoms started to\ndevelop very rapidly, an average of 42 hours after exposure. The infection\nfirst appears in the throat, but by the time the infection peaks after five\ndays it is significantly more abundant in the nose. LFTs were found to\nbe a reliable indicator of whether the infectious virus is present, and they\npredicted that twice-weekly rapid tests would allow diagnosis before 70-80% if enough virus was generated during the course of infection. Future\nresearch will include monitoring the participants for long-term e\ufb00ects,\nand determining why 18 of them did not become infected.\nResearchers have found that Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) is not as well-treated in low- and middle-income countries\ncompared to those in high-income countries. The disease a\ufb00ects around\n1 in every 300,000 people and causes very high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) from birth. Although people in low-and mid-dle- income countries were diagnosed an average of 6 years before people\nin high-income countries, only around 24% of them received additional\ncholesterol-lowering combination treatments compared with 66%, and\nonly 3% had safe cholesterol levels, compared to 21%. They had cardiovascular events, which include heart attack and stroke, at an average age\nof 25 compared to 37.\nA study of data from Nature\u2019s Calendar, a citizen science project by the\nWoodland Trust, has found that flowers are blooming nearly a month\nearlier than they were prior to the mid-1980s, as a result of climate\nchange. The study looked at nearly 420,000 observations of the first flowering dates of hundreds of plants, examining data from the years 1753 to\n2019. In order to examine the impact of climate, the researchers split the\ndataset into two periods: pre-1986, and post-1986. They found that, on\naverage, the first flowering time occurred 26 days earlier in the post-1986\nperiod than it did before then. A strong correlation was found between\nfirst flowering time and the average monthly temperature in the first four\nmonths of the year. Comparing the post-1986 period to the 1950-1986\nperiod, this average temperature was found to have risen by 1.1\u00b0C. \u201cIf it\u2019s\nwarmer, it\u2019s an earlier onset.

It features a 3D portrait of a man\u2019s face.\nHeather Dewey-Hagborg developed the physical attributes of the man by collecting genetic data from discarded cigarette butts, hair and chewing gum. It is no\nsecret that genetic sequencing holds the promise of detecting the cause of medical conditions.

The Union will\ncontinuetosupportthesefully.Butmany\nLetter to the Editor\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\nDear sir,\nIt seems my fears have been realised as the controversy engulfing America has finally arrived at the doorstep of my institution. After several other misguided\nacts of iconoclasm, Imperial proposes to subject Thomas H. Huxley to damnatio memoriae by removing his bust and renaming the Huxley building.\nBy all accounts Imperial could not have hoped for a more virtuous founding figure. I won\u2019t enumerate Huxley\u2019s achievements here, as others have done a\nbetter job of that than I could, but I would highlight his support of working-class boys like me (who are the least well represented group at English universities ).\nIf the college wishes to apply a retrospective moral standard to its benefactors then all past patrons will soon be gone (taking what little visible history\nthe college has with them), as will any potential future benefactors. For what moneyed alumnus would wish to donate to the college when there is a\nrisk that opinions that are seemingly fashionable today \u2013 like racial quotas, to pick a pertinent example \u2013 are deemed untenable in 20 or 100 years?\nOr perhaps Imperial is more relaxed about the moral standing of its current contributors. I don\u2019t recall the college returning any money to\nGary Tanaka, and it is inexplicable that the president Alice Gast still holds her position after the public acknowledgement of the culture of\nbullying that is rotting away the heart of the college, and has been known about since at least 2014 following the death of Prof. Stefan Grimm.\n\u2018Huxley\u2019 is, of course, a term of derision \u2013 but not because of the man, because of the building. Constructed during the austerity of the 1970s (an austerity that\nmight return if the college continues its current moral panic) and taking the name of its predecessor (now the Henry Cole wing of the V&A), the Huxley building\nfails on just about any standard of quality you can name: space, light, heating, circulation, acoustics, legibility, accessibility, aesthetics. Even after years of partial\nrenovation it remains a comically dire building.\nSo if Imperial wishes to substantively improve the conditions of its students and faculty, I propose three simple steps: fire the president, demolish the building, and\nkeep the name.\n- Daniel Sykes (Computing, 2010)\n\n"

Scan to find out more,\nand apply!\nThe Glow is a lockdown play, not in the sense that\nit is about people staying hidden away in their\nhomes,butratheritisabouttime,andhowdelicateour\nperception of it can be. Alistair McDowall\u2019s new play\nat the Royal Court cannot be captured by a single gen-re. With a story that unravels across history and space,\nThe Glow borrows from almost every genre imagi-nable: some mind-bending sci-fi from 2001: A Space\nOdyssey, some heartfelt melodrama, some M.R. James\nghost stories. The final product is more a meditation\non life, death, and humanity than a straight narrative\nplay; but that is what makes it so enthralling.\nBeginning with a Victorian spiritualist attempting\nto use an anonymous woman as a medium to conduct\na s\u00e9ance, we learn that there is far more than meets the\neye to Ria Zmitrowicz\u2019s unnamed protagonist. Simple\nyet striking lighting, sometimes just from an onstage\ncandle wielded by the supercilious spiritualist Mrs Lyall (effortlessly played by Rakie Ayola), gives the first\nact an eerie aura that echoes classic paranormal horror\nstories. But the unnamed protagonist is not just a me-dium: she is literally beyond time \u2014 a concept that the\nsecond act goes on to explore. As the horror elements\ndissipate, philosophy and sci-fi fill its place. Without\ngiving too much away we see the unnamed protagonist navigate relationships with a variety of historical\ncharacters who illuminate the spectrum of human\nemotions. Some are jealous of her ability and want to\nharvest it for their own. Some want to help her. Sometimes she is outcast as an outsider. Sometimes she is\nwelcomed.\nDespite the metaphysical density of the story, McDowall\u2019s writing is unpretentious, always placing something unutterably human at the centre of his dialogue;\nhe brings touching vivacity to each character no matter\niftheyareadarkagewarlord,orasinglemother;slowly\nfeeding his audience clues to keep the play engaging.\nThe complexity of the concepts McDowall explores is\nalso made easier to digest by a delightfully boisterous\nFisayo Akinade who multi-roles as Mrs Lyall\u2019s disgruntled teenage son, and a paranormal researcher, amongst\nother characters. He gives each of his characters an effervescent charm that complements Zmitrowicz\u2019s more\nreserved unnamed protagonist. Their interactions are a\ntestament to the combination of Vicky Featherstone\u2019s\nmasterful directing and McDowall\u2019s highly perceptive\nand emotionally charged writing.\nAs society slowly emerges from Covid we are now\nbeginning to reflect on what the last two years has\ndone to our collective consciousness. Many reported\nhow their sense of time passing had become distorted.\nIt felt as if years had passed and simultaneously no time\nat all. 2021 was an indistinct blur of a year. What if this\nexperience was inverted? What if there was someone\nwho was immortal? What would their experience of\ntime feel like? The Glow not only provides an answer,\nbut invites us to reflect on the last two years, and come\nto terms with it. Alistair McDowall has delivered a perfect play for 2022, the year we (hopefully) return to\nnormality.\nRia Zmitrowicz, Rakie Ayola, and Fisayo Akinade in The Glow at the Royal Court Theatre.\nCredits: Photo/ Manuel Harlan\nTadhg Murphy in The Glow at the Royal Court Theatre.\nCredits: Photo/ Manuel Harlan\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 4TH JANUARY 2022\n23\nFood.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\ntag which accompanied it was appropriate.\nThe Tuna Tataki Ni\u00e7oise Salad was probably the\nmost expensive salad I\u2019ve bought, listed for \u00a314. Just\nfrom the price tag, I was interested to see what was so\nspecial about it. It was served in a medium-sized box,\nwith a handful of greens, tomatoes, edamame and a\nfew green olives as a base, alongside slices of tuna. It\nwas the first time I\u2019ve ever seen tuna which looked like\nthat. I even questioned if it was meat instead due to the\nraw appearance of the tuna. Surprisingly however, the\ntuna was incredibly tender and very enjoyable to eat.\nThe combination of the tuna tataki with the soy sauce\nwent well. It was clear that they had tried to make up\nfor the meagre tuna portion provided with a big base of\ngreens, and I was quite disappointed with this. Regardless I would recommend it, just bear in mind you\u2019ll be\npaying for a big chunk of edamame with only a bit of\ntuna on the side.\nFor our dessert, we ordered the Hazelnut, Banana\n& Yuzu Paris-Brest and the seasonal Mont Blanc (I\u2019m\nnot sure this is still being served at Caf\u00e9 Kitsun\u00e9 by the\ntime this column is published). We\u2019ll first start off with\nthe Hazelnut, Banana and Yuzu Paris Brest, which is\na type of French p\u00e2tisserie. I can tell you right off the\nbat, that it was my favourite dessert out of the two. The\nbanana cr\u00e8me mousseline was sweet, but not too sweet\nandthetasteofbananawasn\u2019toverpoweringeither.The\ncreme was carefully placed in between choux pastry\ntopped off with golden hazelnuts and finally with icing\nsugar. The pastry wasn\u2019t tough and crumbled nicely in\nmy mouth, and the combination of the banana cr\u00e8me\nmousselinepairedwiththechouxpastrywentverywell\ntogether. This would definitely go well with some tea\nthat Caf\u00e9 Kitsun\u00e9 serves.\nOur final dessert was Mont Blanc, which is named\nafter the famous French mountain, due to the moun-tain-like shape of the dessert. The Mont Blanc is made\nfrom a chestnut outer layer with a cr\u00e8me and citrusy\nlemon core, nicely packed inside. The bottom layer was\nmade out of biscuit, adding a nice change of texture.\nFor the festive season, droplets of \u2018snow\u2019 made from\nmeringue were placed over the Mont Blanc dessert.\nHowever in all honesty, the taste was underwhelm-ing in comparison to the combination of flavours the\nParis-Brest had. This is not to say that the dessert was\nbad, but as I didn\u2019t know the dessert prior to ordering,\nIhadadifferentideaofwhatitwouldtastelike.Overall\nthe taste was quite bland despite the citrusy core. The\nchestnut outer layer was decent on it\u2019s own, so I definitely think it carried the dessert.\nTo summarise, I found the store to be very charming and pretty both inside and outside. However, the\ninside was quite small so coming in a group of 3-4, we\nwere at the very limit of what a table can hold, with\nthe most ideal number being 1-2. Besides the size of\nthe store, the food there is interesting and is worth trying out - especially the Egg Sando and the Paris\u2013Brest.\nIf you feel like you want to order the other dishes we\nate, please do, just know they weren\u2019t my favourite and\nI personally wouldn\u2019t order it again if I were to go. I\nhadn\u2019t mentioned this unti; now but the service was\npoor and definitely needs to be improved. We waited\ntoo long for our order to not only be served but also\ntaken. I would recommend just paying at the counter\non the first floor rather than waiting for someone to\ncollect your order, as you may be waiting a while. Don\u2019t\nforget to check out the Pantechnicon store when you\nvisit as they have very pretty and interesting items being sold which I won\u2019t spoil for you!\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nTuna Tataki Ni\u00e7oise Salad\nInside the Hazelnut, Banana & Yuzu Brest\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nFOOD\nWRITE FOR FOOD!\nIf the article above has got you interested in writing about\ndelicious resturants or you simply want to share your own\nfood recipies, please email us at:\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA look inside the Mont Blanc\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nTo the woman who stood strong\nThrough the obstacles that seemed to throng\nTheir way to her, obstructing her path,\nShe calmly faced their wrath\nAnd emerged victorious in the conquest,\nKeeping her only quest\nIn mind, because she knew she would only rest\nWhen people would be treated as one,\nWhen people felt confident in their powers,\nWhen they tower\nOver their mistakes, their pain,\nAs though their stories of success have only begun.\nBecause she has fought it all, the prejudice, the ruckus,\nTo prove to the entire universe,\nThat in the poem about her life,\nShe is the most important verse,\nAnd is always much more than the FLOTUS.\nMichelle Obama: an enigma. A woman who may\nhave lived a simple, ordinary life; but breathed\nand lived dreams. A woman who questioned stereotypes and strove to prove her society wrong by persevering towards her goals without hesitation. A woman\nwho knew she wanted her identity to comprise the intelligent and independent person she aimed to be.\n\u201cBecoming\u201d is a memoir that discusses her inspiring\njourney, how she finds herself through each stage of her\nlife and her belief that every phase of life involves continuous evolution and learning. Three phases of her life\nhave been delineated in the book; Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More, where she details her\nlife stretching from her childhood up to the end of the\nPresidential term. I was able to visualise her entire journey as though I had travelled through all the platforms\nof life alongside her, armed with a suitcase brimming\nwith inspiration and insight.\nThe writing style that Michelle Obama has adopted\nis phenomenal. Obama describes herself in the book\nas not much of a writer, but I was astounded at this,\nbecause I could hardly believe my eyes. She can make\nyou experience a whole concoction of emotions in a\nmatter of seconds!\nI laughed at recol-lectionsofchildren\ncalling her a \u201ckinda tall lady\u201d and\nsmiled through\naccounts of cute,\nhilarious moments\nbetween her and\nformer President,\nMr. Obama. I genuinely found myself laying the book\ndown and crying at\nthe passing of her\ngrandfather,father,\nand best friend,\nwho all meant the entire world to her. My empathy got\nthe better of me with her narrative of the pressures and\nflipsides of being First Lady, and how privacy became\nalmost unheard of. The ambitious side of me trembled\nwhen she wrote about how she fought tooth and nail\nto shatter the glass ceiling and break every racial and\ngender stereotype she had ever heard. She went on to\nbecome the proud recipient of two Ivy League degrees\nand secure the job of her dreams in the very building\nthat she looked at with starry eyes as a child.\nAnd yet, despite her multitude of achievements, she\nchoosestostaygroundedandrememberthelessonsthat\nher humble childhood life taught her. She constantly\nrecalls her best friend\u2019s vivacious spirit, her piano lessons with her aunt, and the importance of hard work\nthat her simple parents had taught her and attempts to\nmaintain a low-key lifestyle whenever possible. The ostentatious lifestyle of the White House never deterred\nher from having long chats with the staff or ensuring\nthat her children made their own beds every morning.\nThissimplyteachesusthatitisessentialtolookbeyond\njust ourselves and BECOME MORE by giving back to\nthe society that has been infinitely benevolent to us.\nI would happily recommend this wonderful memoir\nto anybody, and I guarantee that you will not be able to\nput the book down as you skim through the beautiful\nwords that Michelle Obama has penned in an effort to\ninspire us all.\nBecoming\nBook Review\nAkshara Chandrashekar Books Writer\n20\nBOOKS\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nperhaps the\nbest resource\nis to meet\ne ver y th ing\npassively, to\nmake yourself an inert\nmass\u2026\u201d \u2013 deciding for\nth ems e lve s\nthat an object\nat rest does\nnot just stay at\nrest \u2013 \u201c\u2026and,\nif you feel that\nyou are being\ncarried away,\nnot to let\nyourself be lured into taking a single unnecessary step.\u201d\n\u2013 but should rather aspire to forever stay at rest. This\nthread of limitation and futility runs through many\nof his stories, eventually creating a portrayal of Kafka\nas only gravitating towards things we cannot know or\ncannot do.\nHowever, for all its hopelessness, speckled with hu-mour, the more of Kafka one experiences the more one\nrealises that beyond the wild narratives, at the core of\nall his stories is indeed the heart, intelligence, and curiosity with which his characters engage with the fic-tionalworldstheyareputin.Theywin.Theyoftenlose.\nBut when Franz Kafka takes a part of the world and\ndeconstructs it, he tasks the reader with navigating it\nalongside himself and the characters, figuring out how\nto make sense of it along the way. And so, if a thing is\nKafkaesque, it would seem to desire to be fought.\nMetamorphosis does not just leave us with a grotesque turning point, but instead paints the details\nof the struggles of Gregor Samsa\u2019s life in the days and\nmonths afterwards. In The Stoker, the protagonist \u2013\nKarl Rossman \u2013 loses his luggage upon arriving in\nAmerica, but soon sees himself thrown willingly into\nthe politics of the only place he knows in an otherwise\nentirely foreign land: the ship that brought him there.\nAnd finally, in stories such as Trees and Resolutions, the\ndeft construction of all these thoughts and questions\nfor us to ponder suggests that Kafka aims to challenge\nus, as readers, to be willing to wrestle with them. Because, after all, it seems that Kafka places himself right\nthere in the fight with us.\nA fan carrying Michelle Obama\u2019s book \u2018Becoming\u2019\nCredit: Alex Nemo Hanse (@thefoolies) on Unsplash\n\n"
