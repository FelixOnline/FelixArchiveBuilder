    "content": "Reviews Felix 922 17 January 1992\nBill & Ted's Bogus Journey\nDid you know that Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is yen ru oJ su goBs 'deT & IliB backwards? What's more, did you know that this film\nshould really be called Good Bill &\nGood Ted's( as opposed to Bad\nRobot Double Bill and Bad....)\nBogus Journey?\nWell, that's the plot out of the\nway. Now I can get on with\ndiscussing the small print. Oh, okay, this is how it runs: in a completely gratuitous plot twist, the\nproducers decide to resuscitate Bill\nn Ted for a new adventure. This\ninvolves an incomprehensible\nscheme from the future which for\nsome reason means that the princess\nbabes (if you haven't seen the first\nmovie, the chances are you won't understand this one) are whisked\naway into time and space. For a further, and still more\nincomprehensible reason, this\nmeans Bill (n Ted) have to go to\nHell, Heaven and back in order to\nsave them. Don't worry, you won't mind all this confusion during the\nmovie.\nAnyway, the bad die then goes on\nto send back some Evil Robot\nDoubles whose sole aim is to\nconfuse the issue still further. Yes,\neven more. We're talking murky\nmotivations and unclear issues here.\nEverything poo t les along cheerfully, and in the most part\nentertainingly as Ted (n Bill) dice\n(and Twister) with Death, hob-no b with the Easter Bunny and Einstein.\nOh, Joss Ackland plays Death. This\neveryone in the Felix Office has\nmentioned so far, so I guess it must\nbe important. Oh, sorry, Joss\nAckland isn't Death, he's the\nbad die. Hope that's clear.\nLook, you'll enjoy it, okay ? It\nstars Keanu Reeves (watch out for\nhim as a homeless rent boy in the\nfuture. No, I'm not kidding) and\nAlex Winter (the other one. He was\none of the Lost Boys). They're too\nold. But they're okay anyway. And no, it's not as good as the first one.\nThat's what you wanted to know,\nwasn't it ? All you ever bloody\nwant, isn't it ? Work my bloody\nfingers to the bone, c uh.. Oh yeah, the music is complete\nshite.\nThe Most Excellent\nFlying Gerbil\nThe Ghosts\nThe People Under the Stairs From Grand\nBanks\nThe man who created Freddy (and\nsold the rights, daft g it) puts the\nwillies up you once again. A young\nblack boy from the ghetto is\nconvinced to aid his sister's boyfriend in robbing their nasty\nlandlord's house to pay the rent and\nget his mother 'that vital cancer\noperation'. This is not as easy as it\nseems, as the house is very well\nprotected with bars and locks. One\nburglar gains entry and doesn't come out, so the others go in. Once\nin, they find a Rottweiler from hell,\nand when the landlords come back\ntheir situation is grave. The house\nis tricky to get into and impossible\nto get out of. If the fanged fi do, soundproof double glazing (Ted\nMoult would be proud if he wasn't dead) (to stop outsiders hearing the\nshotgun wielded by the psycho\nhusband in his all-over leather\nbondage suit and the odd booby\ntrap) isn't enough to contend with,\nthere are people under the stairs\nwho are so hungry they will eat\nanything that comes within arms'\nreach. In his wanderings, the boy,\nknown as ' Fool', comes across the\nmad couple's daughter, a prisoner\nwhom he must save. Faery tale\nstuff, if not quite Brothers Grimm. The macabre ' Tom and Jerry' chase\nthat ensues is very compelling and\nholds taut suspense.\nThe odd couple of wedded\nlandlords are played rather nicely\nby Everett McGill and Wendie\nRobie (the couple Big Ed and\nNadine from Twin Peaks) with\nplenty of humour and more than a pinch of sadism. The story is\noriginal and exciting even though it\ndegenerates to a fairly predictable\n(but satisfactory) ending.\nGreat film, even if it is pure\nexploitation. James Farrentino says,\n'Forsooth, twas a grade ly swath of\ncelluloid and did I make merry\naplenty'. He's spot on.\nThe Amazing Machine\nUnder the Bed\nArthus C Clarke's latest work. The\nGhost from the Grand Banks fits\nright in with what we have come to\nexpect from one of the oldest\nscience fiction authors still writing.\nThe book is his contribution to the\nmyth of the Titanic. In this case, the\nnovel deals with attempts to salvage\nthe cruise ship in the early part of\nthe next century. As is inevitable in\nfiction such endeavours do not go\nsmoothly. The plot, however, is not\nimportant; rather it is an excuse for\nClarke to take us on a trip through\nhis dreams and beliefs about the\nnext millenium. The wild ride that\nensues covers all manner of subjects\nfrom Mandlebrot sets to the habits\nof deep-sea octopus. Along the way\nthe reader is kept entertained and\namused. If, at the end, you wonder\nwhat the novel was all about, well\nat least it served to pass a few hours\nduring term. Worth looking at.\nNicholas Farrow. \u201410\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Advertisement Felix 922 17 January 1992\nIN THE LIGHT OF TRUTH\nTHE GRAIL MESSAGE\nby ABD-RU-SHIN\nThe Grail Message \"In the Light of Truth\" which was\nproclaimed by Abd-ru-shin mediates the knowledge of the\nup building of Creation; it explains the connections without a gap, and gives a survey of all events in Creation. It\nis addressed solely to the individual human being, because\nhe alone has to bear the responsibility for everything he\nthinks and does. If he turns to what is good, all else will\nlikewise turn out well. It has immediate effect upon\nmarriage, the family and finally the entire nation!\nAn important statement in the\nGrail Message is the explanation of the Laws of Creation.\nThey work unit qd ly, in the\nwhole of Creation, in the\nearthly sphere as well as in the\nnon-visible parts of Creation.\nA few of them shall be dealt\nwith here.\nThe Law of Reciprocal\nAction\nor the Law of Cause and\nEffect, which is aptly mentioned in the Bible (Gal. 6,7)\nas follows: \"Be not deceived,\nGod is not mocked: for whatsoever a man so we th, that he\nshall also reap.\" This Law\napplies not only to the earthly\nbut also to the spiritual seed\nand bar vest! Therefore, if a man holds good thoughts,\nintuitive perceptions and deeds\nhe will, according to this Law,\nreap a multiple or good in due\ncourse\" on the other hand, if\nhis volition is evil, dark retro actions will come to\nhim to a greater extent. The choice between good\nand evil volition lies in his free will, in which the\nresponsibility of the human being is also founded.\nIn this Law is fulfilled the fate or karma of man. Hence\nif at some time he encounters a harsh fate for which he\nwould even blame God, then he, through his own fault,\nhas given cause for it, which may often have been long\nago in former earth-lives. However, it lies again with man\nto turn everything to the good if he earnestly strives to\nobserve the Laws and Commandments of God.\nIn the Law of Sowing and Reaping, the Law of Reciprocal\nAction, lies also the solution to the frightful fates of the\nmasses and of individuals among earthly mankind which\nwe witness today, and which arouse compassion within\nus!\nThrough the World Judgement there comes in addition\ninto Creation an increased Spiritual Power, pressing all\nthe good and bad deeds which have grown up over\nthousands of years to a quicker final release, and accelerating also the natural catastrophes! It is the time of the\n\"end of this world\", which Jesus foretold, in Chapter 24\nof Matthew's Gospel. But only the end of this old, bad\nworld, which after the World Judgement is to be followed\nby a new., good world, with the Kingdom of Peace of a Thousand Years on Earth! Also in the Revelation of John\nthe old world and the new are described in spiritually\nportrayed pictures.\nThe Law of Gravity\ncan be observed when, for example, a piece of iron sinks\nto the bottom in a glass of water, whereas a piece of cork\nwill not go down but remains at the top. The effect in the\nlife of human beings is exactly the same. According to\neither its good or its evil volition, the human soul had\nmade itself lighter or heavier. As a result, either it rises\nup to lighter regions, or it sinks down to lower, dark\nregions after its physical death.\nThe Law of Attraction of Homogeneous Species\nis ap dy expressed by the popular sayings \"Birds of a feather flock together\" and Like attracts like\". Even the\nwhole social life of mankind on earth is influenced by it.\nWhether it concerns a union of peoples, races, or one\nfrom religious, social, professional, economic and political motives, human beings who in some way are suited\nto each other will always come together. The ancient\npeoples had some idea of the effect of this important Law,\nand followed it unconsciously, in that they separated into occupational and educational classes. In\nthese each had the opportunity to live and develop\non homogeneous so u. The gradually emerging\ndivision into upper, middle and lower classes,\nhowever, was wrong! On the one hand it produced envy and hatred, and on the other conceit,\narrogance, as well as sloth, and\nfinally, as a result, class-conflict.\nIn reality, however, only the\nstanding side by side and working\ntogether of all classes can henceforth produce a harmonious development. For then every class is of\nfull value in its own way; it has\nabilities and merits which the\nothers do not have; it is a necessary\nlink of the whole. All social problems can be solved later, once this\nLaw has been recognised aright.\nLasting social peace and ascent\nwill then be guaranteed.\nThe Law of the Necessary\nBalance between Giving and\nReceiving\nWhen Jesus said \"It is more\nblessed to give than to receive\"\n(Acts 20,35), He had in mind this\nLaw. All processes in Creation are subject to this Law,\nwhether it oe the interplay of forces between the celestial\nbodies, or the sense ol-bal ance of the physical body. Day\nin, day out we observe it, though for the most part\nunconsciously, be it in breathing in and out, or when we\nendeavour to ' redress the balance\" in something. On the\nother hand, we may come to harm when something\n\"throws us out of balance\", in great things and in small,\nfor non-observance of this Law causes stagnation and\ndisturbance, even decline and decay if the disregard\ncontinues.\nThus this Law of Balance between Giving and Receiving\nwill one day playa fundamental part in a true international\nunderstanding. The time has come for the peoples and\nraces to stand side by side, mutually respecting, helping\nand furthering one another, in the recognition mat every\npeople, every race possesses earthly and spiritual values\nwhich are indispensable to complete the whole, and which\nin turn other peoples and races do not have. That then\nstipulates a vital exchange of these values, an exchange\nthat must hold the right T>a lance in accordance with the\nLaw of Balance between Giving and Receiving!\nOn 6th December 1991, it was 50 years since the death\nof Abd-ru-shin (Oskar Ernst Bernhardt). The author\nchose the name \"Abd-ru-shin\" in fulfilment of a former\nearth-life, which was the preparation for his present\nworking. May these few references to the content of the\nGrail Message be enough to bring to mind the Work of\nAbd-ru-shin, who 50 years ago followed the Call of the\nEternal One. With that was fulfilled his high task of\nbringing inner peace to the human beings and showing\nthem the way to the luminous heights.\nThe Grail Message \"Inthe Light of Truth\" by Abd-ru-shin\nis available in the Imperial College Union Bookshop or\nthrough your local bookshop.\nGrail Acres Publishing Co., 23 Hamilton Road, Sidcup, Kent DA15 7HB.

    "content": "17 January 1992 Felix 922 Reviews\nV.I. Warshawski\nOkay, here's the story. Kathleen\nTurner (self-confessed 'hottest\nwoman in Hollywood', arf arf)\nplays VI Warhawski, who I'm reliably informed is a 'tough-talking, fiercely independent, sexy\nP.I.'. Let's take that one part at a time,\nshall we? First up, Ms. Turner is\nnot the hottest woman in\nHollywood; she's one of those\nsecondary celebrities trapped in the\nhalf-way hell of mediocrity.\nSecond, VI Warshawski isn't tough-talking (she just looks that\nway). Third, 'fiercely independent'\nmeans, in this context, a few lines\nthrown in for authenticity. Fourth,\n'sexy' .. well, each to their own, I guess.\nWarshawski strikes up a casual\nflirtation with an ex-hockey player\n(would you believe it?) and hey! he\ngets wiped! And furthermore! he\nhas! a young daughter! who is at\nrisk from a sinister conspiracy for\nmoney and land! Drug-dealers and\nreal- estate dealers, scum of the\nearth, that's what I say. You can\nwork out the rest (God, I love that\nsentence. It's saved me so much\ndrudgery over the years).\nSo VI goes to work, armed with\nonly her self-righteousness and a series of annoyingly trite messages\nabout succeeding in the man's world of the private eye biz. As she\ndoes so, she uses what might be\ngenerously termed 'feminine wiles';\nif you prefer, she tarts about.\nAnd that's really where this film\nfalls apart. The script is pretty\ndreadful, reeking of every half-assed clich e in Jim McCliche's Big Book Of Cliches; in fact, everything\nhinges on the fact that VI is a woman. Not just any woman, she's supposed to be intelligent and\nindependent, so how come this boils\ndown to batting your eyelids in\ntimes of danger and genital-injury\nself-defense ? Hell, I can do that,\nbut no-one's making a movie about\nme.\nA no-no. If you're really an\nintelligent and independent woman,\nrun like hell.\nThe Flying, Intelligent,\nIndependent (and Male) Gerbil\nFreddy's Dead\nQueen gags aside, this film really\nis pretty poor. Okay, Queen gags\nincluded. It's set ten years from\nnow when all but one of the Elm Street kiddies has bit the big one\n(oo er) and the final dude is nearly\ncrazy. He ends up in a juvenile\nrehabilitation asylum and meets a few new bits of claw fodder and a couple of psychiatrists who even\nhalf believe him for'a change. The\nkid has no memory so it's back to\nSpringwood (Freddy ville) for\nrevelations of Freddy's past and a few stiff i es(f woo ar). Who is\nFreddy's child? How did he get his\ndream powers? Who. gives a toss?\nWhy is it 'Freddy's Dead' when he\nwas dead in the first film? Why did\nWile E. Coyote always fall for the\n'tear through the painting' gag?\nBuggered if I know (save the\nFreddy bits)!\nThere are only four deaths in the\nmovie (including Freddy), and\nFreddy dies in 3D!! That crap red-green 3D that barely worked on TV a few years back, and then only the\nlast ten minutes of the film. The plot\nchanges from special effects a go-go to A team slug out between\nUncle Fred and his fickle baby\n(plenty of gratuitous knives,\nbaseball bats, etc. pointing out of\nthe screen). Nice cameos by that g it who's engaged to Winona Ryder\n(not any more - Ed. Ha ha ha) (who\nhad scissors for fingers), a bloat y sarcastic stumpy 'comedienne', and\nan ageing rocker (School's Out\ndudes). The effects are pretty cool\nand the first death is very funny\nPLUS over the end credits all the\nbest effects from the whole set of\nnightmares are shown (the poster\nwas right, they saved the best till\nlast).\nA right poor film that's just there\nto grab your cash. It may be the last\nfilm for Freddy but be prepared for\nFreddy - the next generation.\nThe Amazing Machine,\n, The Final Countdown\nThe Student Unions of Imperial College Present\nby:\nTuesday28 th January to Saturday4% t February7:10 pin.

    "content": "17 January 1992 Felix 922 Music\nWhere did you get the name for\nthe band from, I know it has\nsomething to do with the Kenneth\nAnger film?\nIt was on a long list of other names,\nand we picked that because of the\nimagery of the film you know,\nScorpio Rising we'd sort of associate ourselves with that, you\nknow, that sort of imagery. And that's why basically, it's quite\nsimple. Well, umm, anyone got a light, sorry.\nI thought you sounded like Primal\nScream, on the album.Is that\nintentional?\nNa, Na it's just that you know, the\nthing with that is that it's just a direction, you can see that\nthat' s... you know it' s a change not\nto hear Ned's Atomic Dustbin.\nDo you intend to follow Primal\nScream, into the Loaded thing?\nNo, they follow us...no we do our\nown things...yeah I suppose just\nlike they have their bit... that's their\nmentality. They've got their own bit\nwe've got ours, whether we do two\nthings that are the same I mean,\nwell they won't be. They went\nthrough that relief thing where they\nchanged a lot of things hopefully\nwe'll be able to do that in the future.\nIs techno really the only\ninteresting thing around?\nIt's not the only interesting thing,\nI prefer the guitar sound, it sounds\nvery nice, you know... Theoretically though it's the only\nnew thing that had happened\nmusically, truly you know, new.\nThat's all we meant... you know,\nTechno is totally new like, well like\nguitar playing was new in '66. Well\nit can be taken two ways really you\ncan look at it as something new\nwhich therefore is good or you can\nlook at it as something new which\nis shit whichever is the way you\nlook at it. The trouble with techno\nis that it pushes people down you\nknow it's not, it's music for people\nwho are dead heads...it's used by\nso many people you know... some\nof it's really bad, especially the E culture inside especially with all the\nopiate dE that's going into it, it's getting everyone into smack... It\nmakes people be ordinary, it's like\nmu zak. Sometimes when you hear\nit and one minute it's brilliant and\nmakes your hair stand on end/then\nthat all...what was it country and\nwestern for the red- necks. It's like\nerr E generation C&W, but it is\nnew. Well you know all forms of\nguitar music have been done, apart\nfrom ours\nWell what is your influence?\nI'm rather more influenced by the\neffect a group's had rather than\nwhat they sound like. You know,\nthere is only so much you can do\nwith guitar and a set of drums, but\nthe singing really should make\npeople think. It should sound\nbrilliant and aggressive and get\ninside people because you listen to\nthe words of the song, it means\nsomething to you after a couple of\ntimes of listening to the words. You know what they're singing about\nand if you don't get it right you\nmake up your own meaning for it.\nYou've then got something personal\nwith the song , you can listen to that\nindie stuff and you can't understand\nthe words, as they're aren't any\nreally. Or the words that there are\nare just pop blab. It's all quirky little\ncatchphrases.\nWhat is your message then?\nThink for yourself, you know and\nlisten to this, it's really loud and\nreally cool, yeah. That's about it\nreally. You know the way I write\nsongs is to try and use words that\npeople wouldn't normally use. Well\nwe want to be exciting and\ndangerous and sound wise and well\nmentally stimulating. We don't write songs for other people you\nknow we just do it ourselves. We don't say like lets sound like the\nCharlatans this week and just record\nlike I'm sure many other bands do.\nWe're not in any scene really you\nknow.\nDid George Bush's collapse scare\nyou at all?\nNo not at all really. I think Dan\nQuayle would make a fine\npresident.\nWould you like to see a punk\nrevival?\nNa, it's a pile of shit, pub rock,\nplayed by kids you know. I mean\nwhen it was in its time it was\nbrilliant but musically it's nothing\nit's shit. It used to be good but it's gone, it's totally gone you know. It\nwas more important than disco but\npersonally you know I don't like the\nsound of it. I'm more a Genesis,\nPolice sort of fan.\nWhat's the worst gig you've\nplayed?\nMilton Keynes, no, no that was\ngood that was the best one. Derby,\nDerby that was a horrible gig. We\ndid the Charlton gig the day after\nwe'd played UL U, we went down\nthere like as stars it was brilliant\nthere were people all over the stage\nyou know we went down as well as\nanything and that was our 99th gig\nand we thought that our next gig\nwas going to be even better and then\nwe played at this youth club yeah\nit was like a labour club and there\nwas kids in the audience... needless\nto say that we've not got the same\nagent now.\nWhen is the next time you're\ncoming to London.\nWe're playing the Marquee in early\nMarch, so that's about a month and\na bit away.\nWhat do you want the last line to\nbe of your interview?\nMarijuana, fuck, Satan, kill, dogs\nand err what's the other one? We\nare coming to eat your children.\nThe end.\nThe Lise Yates\ninterview.\nDo you remember when Primal\nScream were good ?\nEeeeek, Loaded!\nNo before that, do you remember\nthe first album?\nEeeeek, Screamadelica.\nNo, Primal Scream. When Primal Scream were a group with\nguitars. They were good then, you\nknow.\nEeeeek, Higher Than The Sun,\nthat's good.\nNo it's not. Now sod off, and\nstop interrupting. I'm trying to\nreview this. This sounds like the\nPrimal Scream of that era, the\nPrimal Scream we, I, knew and\nlove. With guitars, and melodies,\nand lyrics, and I'm beginning to\nsound like my Dad. What's more,\nit has become the new resident on\nmy record deck, forcing Carter\nback into its sleeve. The A side's very good, but I can't tell you the\ntitles, as no-one's told me. All the\nsongs on it are great, and I think\ntwo of them are called Freedom. So\nthere. It's a lot better than\nScreamadelica.\nEeeeek, No it's not.\nSO DOFF. Lise Yates, and Magenta.\nScorpio Rising\nScorpio Rising, not on a roof.\n\n"

Certainly the cost of travel is high and the distances\nlarge, but they are well worth the\ninvestigation and make good\nholiday destinations.\nAs a person from that region of the world, I can tell you that the\nvariety of the cuisine would\noverwhelm a gourmet. The shopping makes a mockery of the\nsales currently on in this country,\nbecause prices are so low.\nFurthermore, the economic\nsuccess of these countries makes\nthem no less comfortable to live in\nthan any other western country. Not\nmore than forty years ago these\nplaces were backward and\nunderdeveloped. Today, they have\ncaught up with the West and have\neconomic growth rates far faster\nthan any western country. Hence\ntheir collective name of the 'Four\nLittle Dragons'.\nI write this article to attract you\nto an exhibition, held by the\nChinese, Singaporean, Taiwanese\nand Korean societies.

On top of the\ncurrent 100% allowances for R&D, companies will be awarded\nadditional 25% tax credit for\ninvestment made over and above\nthat made in a base year.\nThe policy will be progressively\nrevised to incorporate all investment\nin innovation including design and\ntechnology transfer.\nThe 'Scientists in Britain' policy\nwill have a considerable impact. It\nwill create a genuine incentive for\nnew investment, and bring Britain\ninto line with the USA, Japan and\nFrance, whilst meeting European\nCommunity requirements which\nlimit research grants to 25% of cost.\nTo complement the 'Scientists in\nBritain' scheme, technology trusts\nwill be established throughout the\ncountry during the course of the\nnext Labour government. These\ntechnology trusts will be run by\ntechnologists and business people,\nand will bring together universities,\nindustrialists, financiers and\ngovernment.\nThe technology trusts will have\nthree main aims.\n1. To improve the quality of\ntechnology transfer to smaller\nfirms, ensuring that they have ready\naccess to the best of the world's new\ntechnologies.\n2. To open up laboratories and\ntheir technicians to help small and\nmedium sized firms turn their ideas\ninto commercial products.\n3. To help in the commercial\nutil is ation of ideas developed by\nuniversities and polytechnics in\ntheir area.\nAgain, the technology trusts will\nbuild strength into the economy.\nSkills and Training.\nBridging the skills gap is a crucial\nfactor in recovery, and Labour's 'Skills in the 90s' programme will\nbring together the Department of\nTrade and Industry (DTI) and the\nDepartment of Employment to do\nthis. A Labour government will\ncreate a coherent national training\npolicy. Labour will introduce a minimum training Contribution to\nprevent the bad employer riding\nfree on the back of the good.\nCompanies should not be able to get\na competitive edge by poaching the\nworkers other companies have\ntrained. We will therefore ensure\nthat those employers who do not\npay thier fair share contribute\ninstead to local training funds.\nYoung people will have a right to\nlearn under Labour. We will give\na much higher priority to the\ndevelopment of National Training\nQualifications, and prevent\nemployers taking on 16 to 19 year\nolds without a proper training\ncontract.\nIn addition to these measures to\nimprove training, Labour is\nworking on proposals to create a University for Industry, building on\nLabour's expertise and success in\nsetting up the Open University.\nPlans are being drawn up in close\ncollaboration with industry, higher\neducation, training and\nbroadcasting institutions to create a modern high tech university to\ndeliver a wide range of courses.\nWatch this space!\nBacking British Exports.\nBritain has always been a trading\nnation. Our prosperity has rested on\nour ability to sell goods to the\nworld. Export led growth is the\nonly guarantee of sustainable\ngrowth.\nA Labour government will introduce four measures to provide\nthe basis for export led growth in\nthe 1990s.1. We will create are vitali sed and\nintegrated export service combining\nthe trade functions of the D TI, Foreign Office, and the British\nOverseas Trade Board.\n2. We will ensure through our\none stop advisory network that\nsmall firms wanting to export have\na single point of access to market\ninformation, advice and assistance.\n3. Labour will launch regional\nexport drives in Britain in\ncollaboration with Chambers of\nCommerce and regional\ndevelopment agencies.\n4. We will encourage\nAmbassadors and other UK representatives abroad to deepen\ntheir knowledge of British export\nindustries and become more active\nin their support.\nGreening Industry.\nThe great challenge of the 1990s is\nto modernise industry to make it\nenvironmentally friendly. A Labour\ngovernment will announce urgent\nmeasures.\nNew national and European\nresearch programmes will encourage the development of new\nenvironmental technologies,\nincluding application of information\nand biotechnology. Technology\ntrusts will be encouraged to play a leading role in helping small and\nmedium sized firms adopt more\nenergy efficient and waste reducing\nprocesses. New labelling procedures will also be introduced\n\u2022to provide consumers with full\ninformation about the\nenvironmental and energy\nimplications of products.\nTo provide maximum public\nfocus for the Greening of Industry,\nLabour will launch a Great\nEnvironment Exhibition in year\nthree of the first Kinnock government. This will provide a platform and showcase for the new\nenvironmental technologies and\ngive British industry an incentive to\nbecome a world leader in the\nenvironment.\nBacking British Industry.\nLabour is the only party which\nrecognises the central part that\nmanufacturing must play in our\nfuture prosperity. Labour believes\nthat Britain is at its best when we\nuse our people's inventive genius to\nmake goods and sell them to the\nworld. And we know that\ngovernment has a positive role in\nhelping industry to make it happen.\nOnly a Labour government would\nbe fit and able to do this. Labour\nhas listened to British business and\nindustry. We have looked at the best\nexamples of what our competitors\nare doing. Labour has worked out\na real programme for recovery.\nOn the Road.\nLabour's campaign has hit the road.\nNext Monday, we will be in\nYorkshire, and in the East Midlands\non Friday. On Monday 27 January,\nLabour will be back in London and\nthe South East.\nLabour is now telling the country\nabout its policies for sustainable\nrecovery and stable growth. All we\nneed now is for John Major to go\nto the country.\nrP Hmm....1 never C& cove,red -pro\u2122 t tae las to irv e No opinion or feature article\npublished in Felix necessarily\nreflects the opinions of the editor\nor staff of Felix.\nOpposing viewpoints are\nwelcome, and I look forward to\na Conservative article or two in\nthe future.

To ensure that you have\nabsolutely no time free in between\nthe lectures and the bar nights, it all\nstarts on Sunday 26th January, with\na raid on all the halls around\ncollege.

See your\nhall rep if you want to get involved\non that one.\nRag Update\nFollowing that is the major rag\nevent for the term. You' ve had\nTiddlywinks, you' ve had\nMonopoly now Cluedo. Your chance to raid the whole of London\nin an attempt to solve the crime,'\ncollect loads a do sh for Winged\nFellowship and generally run riot.\nThere will be lots of other rags\nthere, a huge party afterwards and\nprizes for the team with the highest\npoints (details will be given on the\nday on how to score). Watch this\nspace for further information on\nhow you could be part of the biggest\nthing since the last big thing that\ncame along.\nOn Saturday 15th February, yes\nthe day after the Guilds Ball so most\nof us will be hung over, there is the\n'Back in Time' collection for\nBIBIC (the British Institute for\nBrain Injured Children), more\ndetails to follow.\nThe next weekend,22 nd February, there's a rag raid to\nBath. Generally a good place to\nPenguin, acting\nRag Chair, with\na multitude of\nideas to ruin a weekend.\ncollect as it's full of mindless\ntourists who are foolish enough to\nspend 'at least 50p' on a rag mag.\nThe weekend after that is the\nOxfam 'leap'. Suggestions include\ntaking part in the Firkin pub leap\nor even 'Leap Draughts'. Any more\nideas please bring them to the Rag\nmeeting on Friday lunch time.\nOn March 4th we have a City of\nLondon licence to 'collect as we\nknow best'. This includes stations,\nthe stock-market, the underground\nand anywhere else we can possibly\ncause a fire hazard.\nSome time later in March there\nis the Mencap Parachute Jump.

Also, on\nMarch 15th, the Fun Run for\nOxfam. An annual event, held in\nBirmingham, which loads of other\npeople will be taking part in. The\nrun is about three miles but is\ngenerally done for fun rather than\ncompetition.

    "content": "Opinion Felix 922 17 January 1992\nLabour leader, Neil Kinnock, and\nhis shadow economic team have\nannounced their plans to pull Britain\nout of recession, and to keep Britain\nout of recession.\nThe 'Made in Britain' package\nbuilds on the earlier success of\nGordon Brown's 'Industry 2000'\ncampaign. To develop plans for\ntechnology and training, Shadow\nTrade Secretary, Brown, published\na discussion document which was\nthe basis of a year long consultation\nwith industry.\nbuild a strong economy is to make\nthe goods and services that people\nat home and abroad want to buy.\nThis is how to secure jobs that\nlast, the way to create wealth to pay\nfor a first class National Health,\nService, higher living standards,\nand a better quality of life.\nWhat are the plans, and how will\nthey work? Labour Shadow\nChancellor. John Smith, has the\nanswer.\n'Britain needs a real recovery, a recovery based on investment in\nMade in Britain\nDeclan Curry,\nIC Labour\nSociety Press\nOfficer, starts\nthe election\ncampaign. Oh\nGod, it's started\nalready.\nAs a direct result of this, Gordon\nBrown announced at the 'Made in\nBritain' launch last week that\nLabour is making industrial policy\nthe central dividing line between\nLabour and the Tories.\n' A Labour government is\nprepared to work with industry to\naddress the training, technology,\ninvestment and regional challenges\nthat face Britain', said Mr. Brown.\nNeil Kinnock told the conference\nat the Queen Elizabeth II\nConference Centre that Labour's Made in Britain strategy 'combines\nstrong commit t ment to economic\nstability with positive policies to\nbuild industrial strength'.\nCommon Sense.\nThe Labour policy, to be\nimplemented on day one of government, starts from one simple\ncommonsense fact: the only way to\nindustry and in people, not another\ncandy floss consumption boom.\n'Labour believes that the first\nresponsibility of government is to\ncreate a stable economic framework\nso that business can plan and invest\nfor the future.'\nA Stable Economy.\nLabour is to combine sustained and\nbalanced growth with stable\nexchange rates, steady and\ncompetitive interest rates, and low\ninflation.\nLabour will maintain the value of\nsterling within the European\nExchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM). Devaluation is not an option.\nSterling went into ERM at the value\nit has averaged over the last twenty\nyears, and there it will stay.\nLabour will tackle inflation head\non, and beat it. Inflation means too\nmuch money chasing too few\ngoods. We will solve both sides of the equation. Like our partners in\nEurope, we will create a prudent\nfinancial system, with sensible\ncredit management to prevent a Credit explosion driving up\ninflation. Labour will end\nConservative policy of driving up\ninflation through excessive price\nrises for water, electricity, transport\nfares, and prescriptions. Under\nLabour, inflation will not be made\nin Downing Street.\nInvestment.\nProducing the goods is just as\nimportant as controlling the money.\nInvestment is a crucial ingredient in\na successful counter-inflationary\npolicy. This is the real lesson c. Germany and Japan, where high\nlevels of investment in industry and\nin people have created economies\nwith the capacity to grow faster for\nlonger and with less inflation than\nanywhere else.\nAs John Smith said at the 'Made\nin Britain' launch:\n'Recovery in Britain must be\ninvestment led. We must encourage\ninnovation and invest in new\ntechnology, and in the skills of the\nworkforce.'\nTo bridge the investment gap\nwith our competitors, Labour are\nproposing a new investment\nincentive, an enhanced capital\nallowance to enable industry to\nexpand its investment out of recession.\nLabour will introduce a Manufacturing Investment\nExpansion Scheme, offering a new\ntax allowance for investment in\ntechnology and equipment. There\nwill be an enhanced first year\ncapital allowance for certain\ncat ago ries of plant and machinery,\nand for investment in innovation\nand design. Capital allowances will\nbe available for capital expenditure\ninvolved in product development.\nThese enhanced allowances will run\nfor a fixed term to stimulate rapid\nincrease in investment at a time\nwhen it is most urgently needed.\nLabour will also offer new tax\nincentives for individuals to invest\nin new and growing manufacturing\nfirms.

    "content": "A Very Select Committee\nMembers of the House of Commons Education, Science and\nArts Committee visited Imperial\nCollege on Wednesday to look into\nstudent poverty. The acting\nchairman, Sir Gerard Vaughan MP, said that allegations of hardship\namongst students last summer had\ncaused concern and needed\nexamination.\nThe Committee, comprised of\nseven Conservative MPs and five\nLabour MPs, had a brief to look\ninto whether some groups of\nstudents were affected by low\nincomes more than others; whether\nthe maintenance grant and loan\nsystem provide adequate finance;\nwhether the access fund was\nadequate and properly administered\nand whether vacation or part time\nwork should play a part in student\nsupport.\nAfter talks with the College\nadministration, the Commons Committee met with members of\nthe IC student Union Hardship\ncommittee, who gave numerical\nevidence of average student income\nand expenditure. Zoe Hellinger, IC\nUnion president asked why the\nCommons Committee was only\nvisiting Imperial College and no\nDavid Evenelt, Sir Gerard Vaughan and Patrick Thompson, MPs of the Committee.\nother University. Mr Martin Flannery MP responded by saying\nthat the report of the committee had\nto be produced quickly - preferably\nbefore Easter. Mr Gerry Steinberg\nMP later told Felix that this was\nbecause the findings of the\nCommittee would be wasted if a general election was called after the\nEaster recess.\nM sHelling er and Graham Lawton presented the preliminary\nfindings of the survey conducted\nover Monday and Tuesday, which\nreceived just under 5% response\nfrom IC students.\nA number of IC students were\nasked to attend, and amongst the\nissues raised was the time taken for\nstudent loans to come through. Mr Steinberg expressed surprise as he\nsaid his 'daughter had got it within\n24 hours of application' in\nNottingham. It was suggested that\nthe delay was due to College\nprocesses.\nOne member of the Commons\nCommittee reported that previously\na College administrator had said\nthat students should rely on their\nparents until 21 years of age. This\nnotion was refuted by the assembled\nstudents, who added that bringing\nback housing benefit for students\nwould be the single most important\npiece of financial help the\nGovernment could bring. Most\nstudents said that it was very\ndifficult to cope financially and\nvacation work never paid enough to\nmake a significant dent in the\noverdraft. They said that overdrafts\nof a hundred pounds or more were\nconsidered a fact of life.\nSecurity Staff Roundup\nThe fate of the College security and\nmessenger staff will soon be\ndecided. The College's Governing\nbody will take the decision on\nwhether or not to implement\nproposals to sack 88 security staff\nat its next meeting on 22 January.\nNegotiations are still continuing\neven though the College ad tn in st ration and the\nmanufacturing unions officially\nended negotiations last Wednesday\n8th January. The Rector, Sir Eric\nAsh, met Trade Union representatives on the morning of\nWednesday 15th January, and gave\nthem a 'sympathetic' hearing,said\nIan French, of the Manufacturing,\nScience and Finance Union, and\nMick Saul of the National Union of\nPublic Employees. They both added\nthat the Rector said he would prefer\nan in-house security system but\nfinancial considerations had to be\ntaken into account.\nThe Rector will be also receiving\na report from Gordon Marshall,\ndirector of Estates, through\nCaroline Fox, Personnel director.\nMr Marshall described this report\nas factual, covering the negotiation\nprocess and containing recommendations that were 'too\ncomplex to describe in detail'. Mr Steve Newbold, Management\nSpokesperson, emphasised that the\nreport from Gordon Marshall was\n'advisory' but that it would contain\nthe original proposals to sack\nsecurity and messenger staff.\nThe situation has not been helped\nby the release of the new college\ntelephone directory, which does not\ninclude any departmental messenger\nstaff. Although this was described\nby Gordon Marshall as 'clearly a mistake' and Steve Newbold expressed surprise that 'anyone\nwould do something as provocative\nas that deliberately'. Mick Saul.( N UP E), commented that\nthose staff at risk had also been left\nout )fa statement of wages of College staff which was released\nrecently, and they had not been\nmeasured for new uniforms which\nusually occurs at this time of year.\nThe Rector met heads of all\nDepartments yesterday and it is\nexpected that this meeting will form\nthe basis for any proposal\nrecommended to the Governing\nbody.\n\n"

    "content": "17 January 1992 Felix 922 Editorial\neditorial\nIn Tuesday's Guardian there was a feature concerning the possible\nbreak-up of the federated University\nof London. Defederalisation seems\nto be very fashionable nowadays,\nthough I expect the process would\nbe slightly more gentlemanly here\nthan in ex-Yugoslavia. There are a lot of arguments for and against\nde federal is ation which I am not\ngoing to repeat here - mainly\nbecause I don't know them - but I will repeat a quote from Dr Derek\nRoberts, provost of University\nCollege.\nIt sounds elitist, and it is. If\nanyone bele ives that to get a first\nclass degree in one of the not-so-good polytechnics produces the\nsame quality of education and the\nsame quality of people as, say,\nImperial, they are either stupid or\nbarking.'\nIn my experience, admittedly\nlimited to two summer vacation jobs\nand a year or two trying to find a real job (as a number of people\nsomehow don't consider working\n80 hours a week a real job), the fact\nthat I have an 'Imperial' degree is\ncompletely irrelevant. Unless you\nintend to follow the exact\nspecifications of your degree for the\nrest of your life in your career, an\n'Imperial' degree may be a positive\nhandicap. This may in part be due\nto the intensive method of teaching,\nbut also in part to the type of student\nthis place attracts. I really don't know.\nSabbatical Elections.\nOur own, home-grown leaders of the future will be exalted to high\noffice soon. You too can watch their\ninnocence corrupted to a vile\nmorass of self interested power\ncravings and cynical manipulations,\nmachiavelli an in their subtlety, until\ntheir over inflated egos explode in\na shower of nepotism and self-congratulatory syco phan cy. Unfortunately due to IC Union\nelection rules, I am not allowed to\nrelease all the information I might\nknow about any one of the\ncandidates. Apart from making the\ncampaign tedious, it means that\nyou, the electorate, don't have all\nthe information required to elect a suitable candidate. Since I don't have much respect for rules or\naccepted conduct, I would just\nignore them, but this might mean\nan annulment of the election, a rerun and generally a difficult life for\nall involved.\nAnybody wishing to stand for the\npost of ICU President, Deputy\nPresident, Honorary Secretary\n(Events) or Felix editor should see\ntheir respective predecessors and\ndespair. Papers go up on February\n17, hustings will be held at St\nMary's on March 2 and at Imperial\non March 5. Voting will occur on\n9 and 10 March.\nCredits\nPoddy, Rose, Mario, Andy T for\nlast week, the Hungarian Railway\nstation abbreviation massive sylvian\nfurry mammals, Toby, Steve N, Stef, Simon, James, Matt, Damayanti, Scott, Declan Curry,\nTroy Tempest, Penguin, Khurrum,\nSumit, Ian, Jonty, Beccy, Nina,\nMarge Areen, Steve F, David L,A li, Sam, Jeremy (Honk) Banal and\nMus musculus albinus.\nPissing Off Important People\nDear Adam,\nAfter the recent industrial\nproblems with the\nmessengers/security staff at\nImperial I have a minor rant that I would if possible like to see\npublished on the matter in general\nas I think that the real issue has been\ngrossly clouded, I hope you will\nbear with me:\nImperial College is in desperate\nfinancial straits. It has no money at\nall. It needs to make some savings\nif it is to remain a viable concern.\nI don't think that too many people\nwould disagree with the essence of the above but the worrying trend at\nthe moment is to make the place\ninto a money making body without\nany thought for what this place\nactually stands for. This is an\neducational institute first and\nforemost and the welfare of the\nstudents should be its paramount\nconcern. On campus we now have\na conference centre occupying a large section of a student residence\nbuilding when we are short of\nhousing, the sports centre is being\nturned into a general London\nfacility and large areas of the\ncampus that could be used as\nteaching areas are rented out to\noutside companies.\nOn top of all this it seems that\nevery service that we have in\ncollege from our security service to\nour catering outlets are being forced\nalong the road to outside tender, a solution that provides a short term\ncash prize but jeopardizes the very\nfabric of the institution by providing\nus with permanent staff who have\nno loyalty to the college, who\ncannot be vetted by college and who\nare ultimately beyond the control of\nthe college. Moreover I suspect that\na few years down the line college\nwill find itself in a very poor\nnegotiating position and the cost of\nthis little exercise will prove to be\na rather bigger bite than it intended\nto chew.\nThere is a bit of a problem\nhowever, security is crap.\nSome attempts are being made to\nimprove it, for example the wipe\ncard system being installed, but this\nis approaching the problem from the\nass end. The real problem is in the\nstaff. I can think of at least two\nmembers of the daytime security\nforce who spend most of the day in\none bar or another in a state of\npartial inebriation... ON OVERTIME! There is no daytime\nsecurity as such anyway, in the\ndaytime they are messengers and if\nthey are the night time staff they are\non overtime.\nThe solution to this problem lies\nstraight at the feet of the college\nmanagement. It is a reorganisation\nof security, which ought to include\nthe -firing of the incompetent\nmembers of the staff, the promotion\nof the good members and if necessary the hiring of new staff to\nfill any gaps. I don't think the union\nwould object to firing a member of\nsecurity for being pissed on duty!\nA taut system would be more\nefficient, cheaper and would not\nhave the effect of alienating and\nangering a large number of the\ncollege's staff apart from those (in\nmany cases very competent and\nloyal) who would have their lives\ntotally turned upside down in the\nmiddle of a period of recession\nwhere jobs are scarce.\nThe way I see it college\nmanagement are taking a problem\nthat they are not competent to\nhandle and throwing it into a someone else's problem field for a short term hump on the balance\nGetting\nDear Adam.\nI'm getting fed up with people\nusing your letters page to argue\nabout whether Christianity is true\nor not. and trying to prove or\ndisprove it. I don't believe this can\nbe done. Christianity is about a relationship, and as such is a matter\nfor experience. Let me illustrate\nwith a story...\nI have a friend called Jim. You have never met Jim, and only have\nmy word that he exists. I cannot\nprove his existence to you, nor can\nyou disprove it. I can present\nevidence; so can you. We can each\nexplain away or disregard the\nevidence put forward by the other,\nand it is unlikely that this exercise\nwill change anyone's viewpoint.\nOnly when you meet Jim for\nsheet. Thought for the day, perhaps\nthey are the people that should be\nfired and replaced by outside tender\nsince they seem incapable of performing, perhaps they are a useless money drain on the\ncollege's account?\nN.B. Before people start\ncomplaining that I have not signed\nthis I would like to point out that I am a student and I have just pissed\noff some very important people.\nThankyou for bearing with me.\nName withheld by request.\nFed Up\nyourself (assuming he is happy to\nmeet you) will my claim be\nsubstantiated. But I won't have\nproved it. Jim will have proved his\nown existence.\n...So let's have no more of this\nproof and disproof, claim and\ncounterclaim\u2014it's all so much hot\nair. Christians, please don't push\nJesus down people's throats.\nAtheists/agnostics/people of other\nfaiths, please stop trying so hard to\nprove us wrong\u2014it can't be done.\nCan we all just respect each\nother's personal integrity and let it\ndrop? Do people have no other\nconcerns to write about?\nYours.\nJudith Robson, Centre for\nComposite Materials.\n\u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

That\nevening at 6.30pm in Elec Eng room 408, he will be presenting a talk which has been coordinated by\nthe Space and Atmospheric Physics\nDepartment and ICU Students for\nthe Exploration and Development\nof Space (SEDS).\nSince Sputnik-1, which sparked\noff the space age in the late 1950's, the Soviet Union has been sending\nprobes to investigate the inner\nplanets and the interplanetary\nenvironment. Throughout these 35\nyears of 'in-the-field' space science\nresearch Konstantin Gringauz has\nplayed a major role, from Sputnik\nto missions to Mars, Venus and\nComet Halley.\nKonstantin Gringauz's expertise\nlies in plasma - charged particle-detectors. Through his involvement\nwith instruments flown in Soviet\nspacecraft he has made a number of\ndiscoveries. He made some of the\nearliest measurements of the solar\nwind and hence discovered the\nplasma pause boundary, which\nmarks the end of the purely\nterrestrial plasma regime in space.\nMany of his detectors flew on\nvehicles in the Soviet planetary\nprogramme. Through these\ninstruments he and his associates\ndiscovered the comet pause at\nHalley's Comet (the Vega mission)\nand very large unexpected fluxes of\nmaterial drawn from Mars by the\nSolar Wind( the Phobos mission).\n\n"
