    "content": "\u2022 .Wlrovarc they anyway? A, quick survey shows that this group is run by a first year PoG, who is actively supported by several first years, few second years and virtually no third years. This certainly indicates a certain correlation of views and time; in the department. Can it be that some . students impressions of. staff. student relations and cooperation have been severly misguided or have they'' just been simply misunderstood. Who* do they' represent? They are' unelected but they did get yOO\nsignatures asking for\" Common is ation n of the staff common room. But this was before the negotiations as to level k were, completed. These500 signatures do not mean that there is majority support for any invasion of the staff common room. Is Interaction really trying to Improve the Physics students' lot. In Physics there is a third year reading room, admittedly underused( mainly because its existence has not been sufficiently published). But without prior warning or asking Physics3? Interaction tookover this reading room as thu ir office^ idd this to their slow poisoning of staff/ student relations and you can see that in effect they are taking away student facilities under the pretence of fighting for them. Are these the people that represent us all? It would seem so if you readS en net, Felix or CEF E. If they still persist in their irreverent and irreconcilable attitude may we respective! suggest that a well publicise cd ballot be called for all in Physics( and only Physics) so we can reaffirm support for our properly elected staff/ student committee and show that the majority of students do not support the nonsense of Interaction,^ ours faithfully John Hall, Patricia Ry all, D. McCormick. On Saturday30 th J anI.C. attempted to reach the semifinal of the U.L. U. Cup for the first time in years, fielding practically their strongest side; N.Ba kewell, P.

L.S.E,' slate arrival did much to disturb the Cup fever worked up in the I.C. team but non the less they started strongly In the wet conditions going close on several occasions c The I.C. defence looked weak with2 or3 players looking terribly stal e,L.S.E.' s centro forward had no trouble in rounding them but he along with his colleagues proved shot shy and when\nthey did manage to shoot they found goalkeeper Bake well in startling form. The game faded into mediocrity, bc.J h teams running and tackling with ferocity, but both these facets were useless when no thought went into their application of the game - as happened here. The winning goal came from a mix up in the L.S.E. defence. This left Bill Milne the simple task of tapping the ball into the net giving I.C.a somewhat fortunate result. Thus I.C. joined Goldsmiths, Bedford and U.C. in the semifinal to be\nplayed this Saturday, February13, if i.e. are to roach the final they must take the game more seriously even if it means neglecting the Friday night booze ups, and begin to use their obvious skills for the benefit of the team.

In\nfact, what the hi-fi society\nintended to demonstrate in\nthe Great Hall last Tuesday\nevening was a method of\n'bringing forward' normal\nstereo sound by means of\nadditional speakers behind\nthe listener, putting out a combination of the two\nfront channels.

We, as concerned Physics students would like to take this opportunity of correcting the impressions created by the Interaction or Basis Group Physics' I.C. by their actions. and publicity( who pays for it?). as regards the Physics staff common room. At the start of this year the departmental representatives approached Professor Mathews to see if provision could be made for a common room\nfor both staff and students. Although money for such purposes' cannot be\nobtained from, the U.G.C. the department declared its willingness to provide the facilities if space could be found. The most convenient area was on level k, Physics, as most of the TJ.G'. labs are on that floor and\nplenty of staff and students would be around there there, so informal contact between staff, and students would certainly be possible, f his scheme has already been welcomed by a great number of undergraduates. As regards the level3 common room no ultimate decision has been taken, and its opening to all in the future has not been precluded. Howe ver the level8 common room was considered to be too small to take on up to another600 people and it was . decided by the staff/ student committee, to develop further facilities for all and so the load might be shared. Hence the level k scheme, which with a bit of efforts by students can be\nin use before the end of term. P his is the stage where the Interaction group took a hand. They dismissed the level k scheme and demanded that the level8 common room be\nopened to all. What objection they have, against the provision of extra facilities is unclear but they seem determined to deny us the use of level ks nd render level8 unusable due to overcrowding, fo further their aims, they have arranged\" walkin s\" and other forms of obstructive. nuisance, claiming a. breakdown of staff/ student negotiation and consequently no alternative.* A fact that was simply untrue, f his action instead of highlighting a need for better understanding and a quicker promotion of informal meetings, has in fact, quite successfully detrimental ly polarised our already good staff/ student relations.' The fact that this is not apparent to the interaction group and that there is every indication that the majority of undergraduates do not favour these\" walkin s\" and \" mudslinging\" 'at Professor Mathews, does not seem to deter them from unreasonable action.

But\nwhat are the root causes of these strikes. The militant left\nwingers, who from the shop-floor spread their propaganda\namongst the workers, must take the main blame. What they\ndo not explain is that if they get their pay rise then either\nthe share holders have to take a drop in their dividends (in\nwhich case they are quite right in withdrawing their capital)\nor the consumer will have to pay more, in which case every-one's money buys less and the pay claims start all over again.\nThese strikes will have to be stopped to beat the ever\nrising inflation and one of the ways of doing this is the\nIndustrial Relations Bill which is at present being slowly\nintroduced by Parliament. This will give the government the\nright to fine Unions who break the laws concerning strikes\nand the new compulsory 40 day cooling off period. A similar Bill was passed in the States two years ago and although\nthis bill was not as streamlined as ours, it has still been\nquite effective e.g. one of the large railway unions was fined\nat $300,000 a day until the union executive was financially\nforced to send its workers back to work where consequently\na reasonable pay claim was negotiated.\nOur Bill is far more sophisticated than the American one,\nhaving over a hundred different clauses and this should give\nthe government far more control over all pay claims.\nFord Motors (Britain) together with the docker s have one\nof the worst records for striking (i.e. they have more militant agitators). Their present claim is for \u00a315 on their basic\nwage (which is very generous) and follows two similar\nclaims over the last three years. This is slowly producing a stranglehold on the Ford management and already much of\nthe work previously undertaken in Britain has been transferred to the continent. The present dispute could possibly\nbe the final factor in the decision as to the future of Fords\nof Britain Ltd. and result in large redundancies. For why ?\nMILITANT campaigners \u2014 probably just a few in every\nunion \u2014 but they are there. At a smaller level we can see\nthis sort of person in our student unions around the country.\nThere may be only one or two in an entire union but these\npeople represent political dynamite as can be seen only too\neasily in the present bomb attacks on leading ministers and\nofficials by an organisation who call themselves the Angry\nBrigade \u2014 these people are just the guerilla form of the\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK Business Graduate? Increasingly this question will be asked. When planning\nyour own career you will want to consider the possibilities\nyourself.\nThe School of Industrial and Business Studies offers twelve\nmonth programmes leading to Masters degrees in Management and Business Studies, Management Science and\nOperational Research or Industrial Relations.\nAbout 90 places will be available in these programmes this\nyear.

All these\ninstances are a very premature stage of a revolution at present largely uncoordinated but there is great potential that all\nthese people can form an organisation capable of creating\ngreat harm to the average citizen \u2014 I say harm because can\nit possibly be imagined how chaotic this country would be\nrun under any other system but capitalism. Freedom of the\nindividual's rights is probably one's greatest asset and is also\nthe one thing that would not survive if a people's party came\nto (or took) power. If it is possible to ever stay at the same\nstandard of living then the only way is to have a wage\nrestraint policy now. It is fair to have a minimum wage for\na forty hour week say \u00a316 (which incidentally the post office\nworkers have had for some time) and after that no pay\nclaims should be considered for above 5%. I wonder how the\ndocker s would feel if the management decided to reduce their\nwages by 5%, say, because the docks were not breaking\neven ?\nAs a final thought: if all the Capital in this country,\nwhich at present is mainly lying with 15% of the people, was\ndivided evenly amongst every man, woman and child then\nthe amount would be approx. say \u00a36. Within 6 months the\nsame 15% would have gathered almost all its capital back.\nCapitalism works.\nSteve Cooke\nTo hell with exams! B< Judith Walker's article about exams is to be welcomed.\nIt contains many telling criticisms of the conventional examination system. Here are a few more.\nExaminations were evolved to provide incentive and to\nenable selection to be made. Incentive was needed because\nmany courses did not (and still do not) by themselves create\nthe urge to learn: scholasticism had to be forced on to the\nstudent, it was part of the brainwashing process whereby\nthe best brains were put into the service of the system. The\nstudents were willing conscripts because they knew they were\nprivileged, and had gained their privilege through winning\nthe examination competition for the few places; and some\nsort of assessment system was needed to conduct this competition for privilege.\nWe have moved into a new era now, in which we are trying to educate as many people as possible. There isn't really\na place any more for the competition, and so exams are not\nreally needed for that purpose. In all discussions about what\nto do instead there seems to be an assumption that a \"method\nof assessment\" is required. That is a hangover from the\ncompetition days. What we need, as teachers, is some sort of\nassurance that students can actually do something as a result\nof the teaching process. We ought to be far more concerned with whether the teaching process is successful or not,\nthan with assessment of students and establishing an order of\nmerit. Actually, if exam answers were used as a criterion\nthey would show that most students are pretty poor at doing\nwhat they have been taught \u2014 and who wouldn't be under\nexam conditions!\nThe whole purpose of education needs to be questioned\nnowadays. It is absolutely right to resist the intrusion of\nsponsorship into universities where it tends to turn the\nuniversity into a training ground for future employees of the\nsponsor, or where it tends to get the staff and research students doing rather special research for the sponsor on the\ncheap. But we also have to remember that university teachers\nwho have little involvement in what is going on in the\noutside world may have a very queer idea of what is worth\nwhile studying. Too much 'academic freedom' may lead to\nthe studies becoming irrelevant.\nOne way of making it easy for studies to become irrelevant is to base courses on a syllabus and examination. It\nmeans that the exam, and the marks that are got by it, become the incentive, and some students who are used to the\nsystem are very content to work on that basis. After all, if\ntheir prospective employer asks for 'a degree' the relevance\nof the topic studied for the degree doesn't seem to matter.\nWe mustn't forget that there is plenty of maths, physics,\nengineering and so on that is utterly useless and will not be\nstudied in ten years time: therefore It is the enlightened\ncolleges that will give it up now.\nHaving got a job, what matters then is what you can do:\nyour qualifications have much less influence on promotion.\nAbility to do is only acquired by doing, and it is the doing\nof things in prep arat it on for exams that is the useful part of\nthe work done in an exam dominated system. Some people\ndo an enormous amount of practice before an exam, and\nsuch work is much more valuable to them in the long run\nthan any revising they may do, and the exam doesn't measure\nit at all efficiently.\nWe are all brought up to believe that what we are depends\npartly on nature and partly on nurture. In teaching we can't affect nature, but we can nurture. It is usually thought that\nthe subject matter taught constitutes the nurture, and it is\nthe syllabus content that equips the student to make his\nway in life. This is true to a small extent: what matters far\nmore in practice is using it. If we had narrower syllabuses\nbut applied their content more widely in a practical way\nstudents would be much better equipped to make their way\nin the world, and we should spend much more time practising the arts and skills and techniques that are taught \u2014 not\nin a tedious way, repetitive ly, but by looking at the real\nworld and spending quite a lot of time working up situations to which the skills can be applied.\nSuppose we knew how to nurture people, what should we\nnurture them for? This is a very real problem, long recognised by educationist s, which is becoming more important\nevery year because we cannot see more than a few years\nahead what sorts of science and technology will be re-qui red. The technologies that present day students will be\nusing in 15 years time will be largely ones that have not yet\nbeen invented or are not yet in undergraduate courses, and so\nequipping people for life by their education takes on a new\nlook. Perhaps you'll all want to come back to college in 15\nyears time; why not? But more important is to develop an\noutlook and a confidence which will enable students to cope\nwith life for the next 40 years without becoming useless back\nnumbers.\nPeople have talked about 'equipment for life' ever since\neducation was analysed at all, but it has become much more\nimportant nowadays. The business of working through exams\ndoes not equip people for life, but for an occupation in which\nall the decisions are made by other people. It may produce\nvery good employees for production industries and efficient\ncivil servants who operate rules made by others, but is that\nwhat people want to be?\nWe are exhorted that we need growth of the economy more\nthan anything, but however valid that might have been in\nthe past it obviously can't go on much longer because the\nworld is getting very full of 'industrial revolution man.' So\nwe have to think about new ways of living and new priorities very urgently or we should foul our own rest and make\nliving unpleasant for everyone. The people who are going to\nsee the need for new priorities and work them out are not\ngoing to be those who acquiesce in the exam system: you\nhave to stifle your rebelliousness too much to be a good\nexamine e!( To be continued)\nEYEBALL TO EYEBALL There is a current vogue in the recruitment of graduates\ninto industry to make the initial decisions on the basis of\ndocumentary evidence without actually meeting the can di dates.\nWe commiserate with our competitors who are taking this\ndrastic step, but we are sticking to our olde-world e approach\nof actually dealing with people as people.\nITT is an interesting mixture of these sorts of old-fashioned\nprinciples with very open-minded attitudes to new tech-no logie s.

    "content": "February 11th,1971 FELIX 5\nMIKE OSBORNE AT THE 100\nThe first thing to be said\nabout Mike Osborne is that\nhe is probably the most\nhonest musician in British\nmodern jazz. Every note\nOssie plays he means,\nwhether in the context of\nChrist McGregor's astonishing Brotherhood of Breath,\nthe various pick-up bands\nand small groups that form\nfor odd gigs, based on a nucleus of a dozen or so musicians associated with the seminal British contemporary\njazz groups of Mike Westbrook, Graham Collier and\nMcGregor, or the group in\nwhich he really shows his\npaces as one of the world\nalto players \u2014 his own trio,\nwith the South Africans\nHarry Miller and Louis\nMholo.\nOsborne first became noticed for his work with the\nMike Westbrook band,\nwhere he tended to be typecast as the band's JohnnyHodges figure, playing a very lyrical role and being\nrather overshadowed by\nJohn Surman's playing the\nbaritone sax with a speed\nand range previously un-dreamt of. Outside the band,\nfirst with the quartet he co-led with Surman and then\nwith his own trio, his playing became more aggressive,\nthough retaining its lyricism,\nand so personal that when\nSurman ' sits-in' with the\ntrio on his occasional returns\nto this country it is now he\nthat is overshadowed.\nOsborne's concentration\nand musical memory are for-mid able: when not soloing\nhimself he listens hard to\nwhat the other musicians are\nplaying and he will often\npick a phrase from someone\nelse's solo and develop it\nhimself later. For instance,\nI remember hearing him try\nwith a rhythmic figure from\na drum solo and re mould it\nuntil, astonishingly, it became the old Jimmy Young\nmm\nWm\n,y'l lt tilt t! it\n>\nw.' type tune ' My Resistance is\nLow' \u2014 though still sounding completely Mike Osborne and with no sense of\nsending it up \u2014 and on this\nhe built his solo. Similarly,\nI remember him playing\n'Secret Love' with Louis\nMholo thundering away in\nthe background in a manner\nthat would have disintegrated a thousand Kathy\nKirby's had they been pre-sent.\nMholo is the perfect drummer for Osborne and has\nprobably played no small\npart in developing the lat-ter's powerful style. He is\nthe antithesis of the Buddy\nRich school of showmen\ndrummers, using a minimum\nof technique but playing\nwith a drive and energy that\nare absolutely compelling.\nHe will play for a whole\nevening without using so\nmuch as a basic roll, but\nproducing explosive cracks\nfrom the rims of his drums\nand loud rumblings from his\nbass drum until he has built\nup excitement to such a pitch\nthat the only resolution is to\nsnatch at his cymbals and\nproduce instant silence, over\nwhich Osborne and Miller\nscream on, then slowly calm\nthings down: a sensation\nthat must be akin to that of\naccelerating towards a pre-ci pice, going over the edge\nand then finding your descent slowing down until you\nland gently but shaken.\nIt was the trio, with Chris\nLawrence standing in for\nHarry Miller on bass, that\nplayed the first set at the\n100 Club. Osborne, though\nnot on his top form, played\nbrilliantly by any standards\nbut his own, and there was\na very fine bass solo which\ndeveloped into a dialogue between Lawrence and Mholo\nwielding sleigh-bells and one\nof those curious instruments\nmade of tin-plate with a sprung striker which produces an eerie whistling\nsound when shaken and controlled by the thumb.\nAfter the interval the trio\nwas joined by Mongezi Feza\non pocket trumpet, like\nMholo an alumnus of the\nChris McGregor band, and\nthe American alto is t Anthony Braxton, a member of\nthe group Circle, completed\nby drummer Barry Altschul\nand two drop-outs from the\nMiles Davis group \u2014 pianist\nChick Corea and the British\nbassist Dave Holland (some-time member of the Piltdown\nMen !).

    "content": "4 FELIX February 11th,1971 Rare entertainment\nWith Union meetings becoming fewer and farther between (JW please note) \u2014 //\nshould be a relief to read a somewhat \"light\" report of\nthe last meeting.\nThe union meeting held on\nthe 28th January was, as us-u a l,a singularly dull affair.\nHowever, here is a brief account of the proceedings.\nThe meeting began with the\nsubject of the refectories.\nAfter some heated discussions on the proposal to increase the bar prices to help\noffset the staggering losses\nof the refectories, and the\nproposed price increases in\nthe refectories themselves, a motion was passed suggesting that we should be\nallowed to consult the books\nand that we were opposed to\nany price increases, in the\nbar or otherwise, until a full\ninvestigation had been made\ninto the subject of the refectories in general. For anybody who wants more details\nconcerning this matter, I suggest they consult the last\nedition of FELIX.\n*Jext business was the\npresident's report. The president expressed her concern\nabout the proposal to set up\na committee of Hall ward-ens; in particular, who was\nto chair the committee, and\nwas the chairman to be ele c ted, or appointed and\nwhether the union was to\nhave any say in the matter?\nHowever, the situation is\nstill in the melting pot and\nuntil anything definite is de-cide d, no action will be\ntaken.\nAs the cleaners in Southside have had a shilling a week rise all round, it is proposed that the hall rents be\nincreased by nine shillings a week. This rise in rent is in-evi table, although it is hoped\nto cut it down to four and\nsix a week by having the\nrooms cleaned less frequent-ly. However, the subject has\nstill to come before the hall\ncommittees.\nNext was a rather confusing motion from John McCullough, which only he and\nPiers Corbyn seemed to un-der stand. However it did\nbring a little sorely needed\nlight relief to the proceed-in gs. The motion was de-feat ed. Next was a motion, which\nwas carried unanimously, expressing our support to the\nA. A. in their bid to become\npart of I.C. It is hoped that\nthe talks are resumed as\nsoon as possible. (They were\nbroken off by I.C.). We then came to the main\nbusiness on the agenda. The\nN.U.S. Grants Review. The\nN.U.S. are starting a campaign to review the subject\nof grants at higher education\nestablishments. The main\npoints are as follows: (1)\nopposition to student loans.\n(2) increase the grant to allow for the increase in the\ncost of living. They have not\nrisen since 1962. (3) sort out\nthe anomalies in the present\naward system, the most striking of which is the distinction made between students\nwhen they are being considered for an award. For\ninstance, a student studying\nfor a degree will receive\nmore than say a student\nstudying for H. N.C. or for\nLife at the Top\nWhilst half of Elec Eng 3\ngo for interviews at the BBC\nand return dolefully when\nrejected, one 2nd year Elec\nEng student already has his\nfoot in the door, in front of\nthe glass panel, rather than\nbehind.\nAndy Finney's first step\ninto the business (apart from\ncribbing the initial and surname of a famous actor) was\nin 1968 when he and a school\nfriend made field recordings\nof folk singing around Stokeon-Trent, and produced a disc under the label Smoke\nRecords. It was decidedly\nlow-fidelity, and sold only\n99 copies, in spite of Andy\ninundating the newly opened\nRadio Stoke-on-Trent with\nrequests, and sending a copy\nto John Peel.\nAt that point he became\none of the first and most successful of local radio's han-gers-on (groupie?) working as\na part-time voluntary technic-ian. During the summer between school and university\nhe was employed at \u00a310 per\nweek, reading news, making\ncontinuity announcements\nand doing chat on record request programmes. He also\nmanaged to wangle a progressive music programme\nat 7.00 p.m. on Mondays,\njust after half the potential\naudience had been disconnected by the piped TV people to make way for BBC\n2.\nOn arriving at IC Andy\napplied to the BBC for a DJ\naudition, and was apparently\nsuccessful (or pulled strings),\nand this lead to 4 weeks on\n\"Pop Workshop\" at \u00a320\nper week last summer.\nThen he discovered that\nhis manager from Stoke was\nnow Assistant Head of Local\nRadio Development, and\nconsequently managed to get\nin on Radio London from\nthe start (October '70), first\non Saturday afternoon sports\nprogramme operations, and\nnow as under-chat-man on\nthe Friday night marathon\n(8\u2014midnight, VHF95.3) which labours under the title\n\"The Pictures are Better.\"\nThe pay, however, is not \u2014\n\u00a36 per show, and not even a credit in Radio Times. But\nIC Carnival got a plug when\nDennis Taylor was featured\nlive, boasting about his tid d ley winks arrest.\na diploma of education.\nApart from some heated\ndiscussion on the subject of\nthe means test, there was\nno opposition to the motion\napart from the young socialists whose motives seemed\nconfused to say the least.\nHowever the matter does not\nend there. A lot of help is\nneeded in the campaign, and\nanybody who is interested\nin helping should contact\nthose concerned immediate-iy.\nThe Young Socialists were\nagain involved in the next\nmotion. They suggested that\nI.C. union donate \u00a350 to the\npostman's emergency fund.\nHowever, any chance of\npushing the motion through,\nwas ruined by their predictable \"force the Tories to re-sign\" bit. It was a pity, for\ntheir motion was a commendable one, though it is\ndoubtful whether I.C. could\nafford such a sum, considering the dire financial straits\nthat the Union is now in !\nMartin Black brought the\nhouse down again by challenging the quorum in an\nextremely loud voice. However the wind was taken out\nof his sails a little when the\nsecretary informed him that\na count had been taken and\nmore than 300 were present.\nI estimated the number to be\nnearer 280.

    "content": "a IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, 11th FEBRUARY, 1971 No. 298\nNew selection\nscheme suggestions\nA new selection scheme for\nHall and Student Houses,\naimed at giving every LC.\nundergraduate a year's residence, is to be presented by\nthe Union to the Student\nResidence Committee.\nIn the past, there has not\nbeen a sufficient number of\nplaces to achieve this aim,\nbut with the advent of Linstead Hall and the Student\nHouses, there are now almost\n1100 places. Since the present undergraduate admission\ntarget is 950, it is now possible in theory to offer everyone a place.\nUnder the scheme, thought\nup by Halls and Houses Rep.\nJohn Sommer half of each\nyear's intake of freshmen\nwould be offered a place by\ntheir departments. The rest\nwould be given a choice of a place in their second or third\nyears. If by any chance there\nwere too many applicants for\nany one year, the unsuccessful handful of people could\nbe chosen by a random pro-ce dure. Students who had\nlived in an inter-collegiate\nHall would also be eliminated in this circumstance.\nJohn has suggested reducing the number of postgraduates in residence; any P. Gs.\nwho were U. Gs. at I.C. would have had a year in,\nanyway. Of the 90 places it is\nproposed should be given to\npostgraduates, John suggests\n75 should go to overseas ap-pli cants, and Hall Committees would allocate the rest\nto the most worthy app li cants, using the information\non the application forms.\n(N.B. In the case of other\napplicants, this information\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n*\n9 Hill l<''J mV'' It\n\u00a79esf om t< Blht <&rotte pl jo to would be used for room allocation only.)\nIn addition, certain reductions would be necessary in\ncertain privileged places.\nRe-admissions could be reduced from the present level.\nJohn suggests a minimum of\n8 per cent; the maximum\nwould be set by the other\nrequirements of the scheme,\nand would be 10 per cent to\n12 per cent.\nWardens places should be\nreduced to around 50, and\nthese should be allocated on\nthe advice of the Health\nCentre, and not used (as happens in certain halls at pre s ent) to allow certain people\na third year's residence.\nStaff places would, under\nthis scheme, be reduced to\none place per Hall, with a maximum of three years residence. Research assistants\nwould then be counted not\nas Staff, but as P. Gs.\nThe number of Union\nplaces, 37 at present, would\nbe reviewed, and possibly re-duce d. Moreover, holders of\nUnion places would no longer be able to have a third\nyear in Residence.\nThese ideas will be presented by John and the other\nUnion representatives at the\nStudent Residence Committee's meeting on February\n24th. Whether they are accepted or not, the Union reps\nintend to push against undemocratic practices in Halls,\nsuch as abuse of Warden's places and election of the\nHall Committee during the\nprevious session.\nSuck Soc\nThe recent acquisition of\ninternal phones by secretaries of 3 hall committees in\nSouthside, which was described by Falmouth Hall committee as childish and one-up man ship, is ostensibly to\nprevent complaints about\nnoise, etc., from reaching the\nwardens. Meanwhile such insignificant people as the Carnival Co-or d in at or and Editor of FELIX remain phone-less.\nHall rents\nAn increase in the rent in\nHalls and Student Houses\nappears inevitable for next\nsession. The Union is proposing an increase in Hall rents\nof \u00a31 per week, and asking\nthat 12/- of this should go\ntowards a 'building fund' to\nprovide further ac com moda tion.\nIt has been realised for\nsome time that I.C. rents are\nexceptionally low \u2014 the\nU.G.C. recommended rent is\nactually \u00a34/10/- p.w. Down\nin Evelyn Gardens, rents are\nin fact so low that the Student Houses cannot make'\nenough surplus to cover the\ncost of future re-furnishing\nand re-decoration. Moreover,\nHall and House cleaners have\nrecently been given a pay\nrise, which will mean a rent\nincrease of about 8/- p.w. anyway.\nThe Union agreed at the\nrecent Council meeting to\nforward to the Student Residence Committee a suggestion that Hall rents are increased by \u00a31 per week,\nwhich would bring the rents\nto a more realistic level and\nmore in line with rents at\nother Colleges in London.\nThe surplus increase, i.e. about 12/-, could go towards\nthe 'building fund'. This\nwould enable the College\nwithin a few years to take\nout a mortgage for a new\nNorthside Hall, or to acquire\nfurther Student Houses. The\npresent residents recently\nvoted 3:1 in favour of a rent increase for this purpose,\nthough possibly some of\nthese residents may consider\n12/- too much.\nIt has also been suggested\nby the College that income\nfrom block bookings, con-ference s, etc., should go towards a buildings fund instead of sub sidi sing rents in\nthe Halls.\nElsewhere in Felix\nPage2 Computer Dating\nService\nPage 3\nLetters\nPage5 Reviews\nPage 6\nTo Hell with exams\nNews in\nBrief\nSunday morning newspaper\nreaders in Falmouth Hall\nwere heard to pass comment\non the park bench which\nfour winged messengers deposited during the midnight\nmovie.\n* * *\nMotorists returning to\nPrinces Gardens late on Saturday night were somewhat\ndelayed by what appeared to\nbe a Hillman Imp parked in\nthe middle of the road. After\nwaiting a minute or so in the\nhope that the offending vehicle would move off, passage\nwas effected by the simple\nexpedient of mounting the\npavement.\nWhile ignorant of the reason as to why the car was\nso placed I hope it was a warning to motorists who\npersist in parking their cars\nwith all but the rear quarter\non the pavement of the Gardens itself. This is an unnecessary inconvenience to\npassers-by who have thus to\ncross the grass\u2014unpleasant\nin wet weather.\nAction in Physics\nTwo weeks ago, after the\nlast union meeting a body of\nphysics undergraduates visited the level 8 common room\nin the physics building. Its\nuniqueness was in the fact\nthat the level 8 is normally\nreserved for staff and post-graduates. Piers Corbyn,\nnoted physics P.G., distressed\nat this state of affairs, made\nan open invitation to all\nundergraduates to come up\nfor coffee. Ironically in his\ninvitation Mr. Corbyn had\nbroken no rules.\nThe undergraduates remained well-behaved, making coffee and tea and charging the proper amount for\nthese refreshments. Physics\nlecturers were seen appearing in the doorway but few\nbothered to stay. One notable\nexception was Dr. Kibble,\nwho talked freely with the\nundergraduates.\n\n"

Both\nhave very good arguments in their favour but with grants\nalready taking 5% of the total education bill, I think this\nlast will be considered very carefully by those in authority.\nThe suggestion to replace the means test by a selective tax on\nhigh wage earners might well work could the change be\nsmooth and immediate. But there will certainly be objections\nagainst the scheme from some members of parliament.\nStill perhaps it's best to buy the philosophy that whatever\na student gets is rapidly taken away from him.

We want more say in course construction,\nwe want to know and examine the relevance of our chosen\nspeciality to society, we want to establish our identities, and\na healthy relationship with our environment. We need a sense of purpose to give us increasing fulfilment as we\nproceed.\nOur present education system falls far short of fulfilling\nthese needs and any education we gain is largely self-acquired. We should be given a good start to life in all its\naspects, and not merely that of acquiring a technical skill\nto get a good job.\nS.I.M.S. could well have an answer in the system of transcendental meditation, and everyone interested in sorting out\nthis problem should consider what the movement has to say.\nT;M. is neither a system of contemplation nor of intellectual titillation\u2014ideas commonly associated with meditation\u2014and in view of this it is perhaps unfortunate to be\ncalled such. It can be looked at in this way: Early astronomers took the earth to be the centre of things and life was\ndifficult. Planetary motion could not be explained properly,\neven with the help of complicated epicycles. Things just did\nnot fit in. It only required a subtle shift in the centre of\nthe 'universe' from the earth to the sun, however, to enable\nthe whole thing to be seen clearly. Similarly, through the\nregular practice of T.M., a gradual shift in the centre of\nattention occurs \u2014 quite spontaneously \u2014 from superficial\nlevels of mental activity towards the silent core of one's being. We become more intimate with our real self\u2014that\npart of us from which every other part stems. And as this\ninnocent process takes place everything around us begins to\ntit into place. We feel more at home with everything including our studies.\nUntil we have a clear perception of what we are, then\nquestions like 'what is the relevance of this?' or 'how do I fit in here?' cannot really begin to solve themselves except\nat a superficial pragmatic level. For a satisfactory subject-object relationship to be established, both elements must be\npresent in full.\nTo many people all this will seem meaningless and silly,\nbut astronomers before Copernicus, the idea of the sun being\nthe centre of the system seemed silly and meaningless. It\nwasn't until someone actually put it there that he saw it\nmade things easy.\nAs with any complete system, the practice of T.M. is complemented by a theoretical side, which though not necessary\nfor the practice, helps the understanding. For any rational\nperson, it is important that his experiences can be fitted into\nan intellectual framework. To this end, and with a view to\nhelping solve the problems mentioned earlier, S.I.M.S. has\ninitiated a course of study entitled the Science of Creative\nIntelligence, which could be introduced into college cur ri cula. This has been done with great success in a number\nof colleges and universities in the States. The course is a study of creative intelligence in all its aspects, including all\nbranches of learning and the writings of great men. Students\ntaking the course will be offered the practice of T.M. to\nsupplement the theory with direct experience. It would be\ninteresting to hear people's views on this. A lecture about\nthe course will be arranged later this term.\nYours sincerely,\nJeremy Bowler, Physics III.\nJUDITH\nD Day Dear Editor,\nI feel most strongly that one aspect of the present political\nenvironment has been greatly ignored recently and I feel it\nis my duty to bring it to the attention of your readers.\nD day will bring very few problems for students who\nshould easily cope with the conversion to New Pence. What\nabout those less able to handle two currencies at the same\ntime?\nIt only takes a little thought to realise that the decision to\ngo decimal is just another part of the Tory fascist plot to\ndeprive the workers of their hard-won freedoms. D day must\nbe seen as intrinsically connected with the Anti-Union Laws,\nstudent and academic restrictions, Law and Order, Social\nWelfare cuts and the Dutschke thing. Only non-thinkers\ncan fail to see the rapidly developing spectre of Neo-nazi\noppression which is sweeping the country in every sphere as\nfast as the Tories can bulldoze Bills through Parliament.\nAre we going to allow ourselves to be trampled on? NO!\nWe must take action! Let us take this opportunity to rise\nand show our solidarity with the oppressed workers.\nBoycott the new Tory fascist money and bring the Tories\ndown.\nClive Willmott (Min. Tech. 1.)\nSTUDENT UNION AUTONOMY\nAlthough it may not seem obvious S.U. autonomy will be\nendangered by the precedent of the Industrial Relations Bill.\nA registrar of S. U.(c.f. T.U. Registrar) has already been suggested\u2014requiring all S.U. constitutions and actions to be subject to specific government sc rut in it y and approval. The\nPrivy Council has also objected to compulsory S.U. membership although provision exists for students to opt out on the\ngrounds of conscience (c.f. agency shops and no closed\nshop policy). This indicates a change of policy because no\nobjections were ever raised to the charters of public sector\ncolleges and new universities which made membership com-pul so ry. Further hints\u2014Patrick Wallup has questioned the\ncontrol of S.U. finances particularly on whether ultra payments are being made from L.E.A. money. This raises the\nspectre of another, a clamp-down on students\u2014all this and\n\"law and order\" threats too.\nElection of Deans\nDespite long arguments the Governing Body has refused\nto allow the students on the Board of Studies to participate in\nthe Deans election. The non-professional staff now can but\nnot students. Privy Councils reactionary stand clamping on\nreserved areas has once again been used to \"justify\" un progressive policies. Once on the Board of Studies, Governing\nBody and various others, student representation has been\nbrought to a halt. Staff-student committees are tolerated not\nencouraged.\nArchitectural Association.\nThe Governing Body were adamantly against re-opening\nor-even re approaching the A. A.'. Our structure is perfect\n\u2014seemed to be the attitude so any moral responsibility was\ndenied. Although the college has little free money the Governing Body wouldn't consider even approaching the A. A. to see if any other help was possible.\nFat Renting Scheme\nThe idea is that lots of us know of flats which are good\nvalue for money\u2014or just avail a be. If the union could take\nout say five year.\" leases and then let out to I.C. students. The\nlandlord if assured of five years of reliable (!) tenancy may\noffer a more favourable rent. So watch for publicity next\nterm.\nHall Selection\nAlways a good stirrer. Changes in general selection policy\nwhich would allow everyone to have one year in hall or student house are being discussed at the College Student Residence Committee. In the past selection has been a pernicious\nscheme based on a students usefulness to the hall or the un-ion. The new policy would mean slight cutbacks in e.g. staff\nand wardens' places. The number of re-applicants would\nprobably remain at about 12%. Council proved slightly reluctant to alter the number of ex officio union places. Complicated details are available in last council's reports.\nSennet\nDear Sir,\nHave we now gained yet another comic-strip of extremist\nfantasy on the I.C. scene\u2014well, so it would seem, judging\nby the latest issue of Sennet. Who can deny that this paper\nhas now got a definite political slant to its reporting, which\nseems only for the enlightenment of those with a MarxistLeninist philosophy? To make it yet worse, all the well-worn\nclich es( e.g. force the Tories to resign), which I.C. delights\nin howling down, with disgust, at union meetings, have not\nonly often appeared but are often repeated. Well, you may\nsay that any idiot could see this and no one takes Sennet\nseriously anyway\u2014it's just a sick joke! That may be a harmless enough attitude, but one can get a sick joke going too\nfar, which is a waste of time and money, and, further it\nmay alienate people not 'in' on the university-joke-scene.\nThis is a bad move, especially as we are trying a publicity\ncampaign to improve our grants.\nAll this you may appreciate but what you may not have\nnoticed, unless you read the un headlined minor Sennet features, is that London college unions will be asked by Sennet\nfor more money, for an increased number of issues per term.\nIs this really on, if Sennet persists in its current wave of\nbiased reporting? Giving money to Sennet opens up the\nwhole question of I.C.U. giving money away. For instance,\nat a recent union meeting it was proposed to give \u00a350 to the\npostal workers. Apart from the legal position of I.C. being a charity (which York university seems to be successfully\ncircumventing) giving money to external bodies should not\nbe the general rule. This money exists for the welfare of the\nstudent body, and to the encouragement of their social and\nrecreational activities.\nSo, dear people, take an interest in union activities and\nwatch where your money goes. More important, come to\nunion meetings and express your views.\nPeace, goodwill, etc.,\nJohn Hall, Physics 3.\nEditor's Note: Sorry, we had to cut some letters which were\nreceived very late.\n\n"

(The previous\nwinning time was done by Steve Bugg last year in 55 hours.)\nOur incentive is the money to be won from the raffle, and\nthe setting up of a Guiness record for this event, so buy a ticket for 1/- to guess the time of the first person back and\nwin a handy ten quid (lOO Op) prize. The hitch begins at\nEuston station at 8.00 hours tomorrow and prospective collectors eager to flounce money off the rush-hour traffic and\ngive our lads a bit of support should meet at 7.00 a.m. in\nSouthside Bar where a few small beers will be provided free.\nRAFFLE TICKETS FROM YEAR REPS\u2014ONLY 1/-, 5pTi dd ley winks No.2 The last tid d ley winks race down Oxford Street was such\na success that the Met police have kindly invited us to DO\nIT AGAIN ! !

    "content": "February 11th,1971 FELIX 7\nSPORTS FELIX\nBadminton Success\nI honestly feel with the talent\nin Mens II their position\nshould be slightly higher,\nand in fact they have only\nbarely lost to the teams\nabove them; if they beat\nKings I( who are holding an\nequal second position with\nChelsea) they could well be\nsecond as they are ahead in\nactual games for.\nThe ladies are doing well\nfrom the point of view of\nhaving beaten two colleges,\nbut unfortunately they had\nto cancel three of their\nmatches (which under the\nU.L. U. rules are immediately\nconceded), thus their position\nis in fact unknown to date,\nbut from other colleges results they are at least 4th out\nof eight colleges.\nComing finally to the Mens\nI and Mixed my prediction\nat the beginning of the season\nhas been been very nearly\nAt the close of last term\nthe U.L. U. Badminton\nLeague indicated the success\nthat I.C. Badminton has been\nhaving. The table looked\nas below.\nSince then the men's IV\nhave beaten Q.E. C. who up\nuntil this glorious day (Wed.,\n27th January and on their\nhome courts too) held first\nposition with an unbeaten\nrecord. Showing that with a full team our position in the\nleague should be undoubtedly higher.\nThere is not much to say\nabout Mens III except that\nthey have been extremely\nconsistent, having only lost\nto first position Q.M. C,5 \u20144.\nWe meet them on our courts\nsoon and hopefully the result\nwould be reversed then, maybe putting Mens III in first\nposition, a position which\nthey justly deserve.\nMens II also deserve a good pat on the back as division II is a strong division.\nCross Country\nNow that the active contingent of the Cross Country Club\nare fit and keen, and some team spirit and competitiveness\nhas arisen, a recognised pack (group of runners of similar\nstandard) has been formed. As this pack (mostly 1st years)\nimproves over the next year or so, it should become quite\na barrier to opposing teams.\nThe creation of the pack began at the U.L. Championships, although its position was not high enough to produce\na good result. The team came 4th( worst position for years),\nthough the inclusion of Paul Clarke (bedridden) could have\ngot 3rd. Individual Positions: Barry Dabrowski 7th( selected\nto represent UL U in BUSF Champs), Rog Phelps 13th, Herman Rooney 27th, Rob Parker 31st, J. Bathurst 36th, P. Willoughby 37th. The last Wednesday of last term, the club handicap was\nwon by Dave Jones (joggers anonymous) closely followed\nby James Bathurst. The first five home recorded personal\nbest times, which shows what they can do given more\nincentive.\nAt the QMC '7^', we returned without the John Brooks\nTrophy for the first London College after holding it for\nfive years. The following Wednesday the London Colleges\nLeague was held at Petersham, and organised by I.C. As\nsome of our members were required to officiate, only three\nrunners started for I.C. II, thus a drop to the Second Division\nis now inevitable. The first team, however, ran very well,\npacking six in the first forty and gaining 4th place with\nthe top five teams separated by only a few points. The\never-improving Rog Phelps almost led the team in but was\npipped on the post by Barry Dabrowski, in 14th and 15th places; others were R. Parker 21s t,H. Rooney 31st,R. Wilson 33rd. At the U.C.'5', the team position of 12th( behind Oxbridge, etc., was good enough to beat all other ULU teams.\nLast week the Cross Country Club easily defeated U.C.( Wednesday) and Kings (Saturday) in friendly matches.\nSuccess is thus beginning to come our way.\njustified as we whipped everyone in sight.\nThe Mens I even beat N.P. with only four men by 5\u20144,\nhaving conceded three games,\nand losing their first game;\nthis meant we had to win the\nother five. Thanks to C. Gaukroger, Souki and Malcolm Roberts we were able\nto keep an un blemished record of not losing a single\nmatch in two seasons.\nThis season the Mixed\nhave had a great success. The\noriginal team being G. Georgiou, S. Donald, Souki,\nLynn Beynon, Sue Thompson and Brenda Dilley. A truly formidable team without a doubt. With the choice\nof good players at I.C. we\nhave had frequent guest appearances by C. Gaukroger,\nHillary Rowson, Mary Short,\nJane Gregory and John\nPowell.\nPosition PW L FA%1st Mens ... 1 6 6 0 42 12 100\n2nd Mens ... 4 6 3 3 28 26 50\n3rd Mens ... 2 6 4 2 31 23 67\n4th Mens ... 4 6 2 4 24 30 33\nMixed ... 1 4 4 0 32 4 100\nLadies ... \u2014 3 2 1 16 11 \u2014\nRifle Club well ahead The postal strike has\nbrought a frustrating period\nto I.C. P.R.C. At the beginning of the term the club was\nwell ahead in all but one of\nthe leagues, and, although the\ncards are still being shot,\nthey cannot of course be post-ed, which means that we cannot tell for sure exactly how\nfar ahead we are.\nOf all the I.C. teams, rifle,\npistol, novice, etc., there has\nso far been only one defeat,\nand that was of the Engineers\n'B' team who, unfortunately,\nwere shooting against a college with no 'A' team, just a'B' team. However, both Engineers teams (they are not\nreally engineers), who shoot\ntheir matches shoulder-to-shoulder with the opposition,\nare now firmly entrenched at\nthe top of their leagues. The\nEngineers 'A' will, we hope,\neasily carry away the Engineers Cup and by so doing\nwin the U.L. Small-bore\nRifle Championship.\nThe London University\nInter-University League ' C team, who are by chance all\nmembers of I.C., are now\nlying second and would be\nfirst if a card had not been\nmislaid. If they finish second,\nat least they will know that\nthey can beat the team who\nis at present in first place.\nMen's Hockey I. C.1st XI 2, Letchworth 1\nWith the pitch rather\nwaterlogged, I.C. adapted to\nthe damp conditions well, and\nafter twenty minutes took the\nlead. John Manning, having\nbeaten his man, drew clear\ndown the right wing, centred\nhard into the goal mouth, and\nafter the deflection off the\ngoalkeeper, Pete Bates scored\nthe goal. The second goal\nwas again started by the right\nwing, who centred into the\nD, and Mark, cutting in from\nthe left, beat the goalkeeper\nwith a fine shot.\nThe second-half started off\nwith disaster for the left-half\nMartin Field, who, endeavour ing to clear his lines (al-though the goalie called for\nthe ball) could only deflect\nthe ball into his own goal.\nDespite this setback, I.C. settled down and played out\ntime for a well-deserved win.\nMet Police 0, I. C.1st XI3 Fielding a changed team,\nI.C. were in total command\nof the game and the score\ncould well have been dou bl Editorial\nThankfully, my pleas have been answered and the increased flow of copy means I need not draw out my pearls\nof wisdom\u2014this week at least!\nAs you can gather from the rest of the page, I.C. are well\nto the fore of University competitions, the soccer, rugby\nand hockey clubs all having reached their respective semi-finals. The girls of I.C. W.S.C. have gone one better and are\nalready in the final of the Penney (hockey) Cup. When one\nconsiders the amazing brevity (?) of their numbers compared\nto the other colleges they really must be congratulated\nand we wish them the best of luck in the final.\nThe strain of keeping high standards in college sports has\nunfortunately come to the fore recently. A few clubs have\nundergone a crisis 'at the top' \u2014 let us hope these are all\nresolved satisfactorily. Let us also hope that the landlords\nof Knightsbridge are not further subjected to the 'locust-like'\nincidents which occurred on the Wednesday night following\nthe cup matches\u2014I.C. can do without this bad reputation!\ned but for the waywardness\nof the forwards' shooting.\nThe first goal developed\nafter a short corner, and it\nwas finally Dave Richman\n(Wonder-Boy again) who\nscored with an easy chance.\nHe also had a hand in the\nsecond when he received a pass from the centre-half,\nand after controlling the\nball, hit a perfect through\nball to the centre forward.\nPete Bates rounded the goalkeeper and ran the ball into\nan empty net.\nThe I.C. defence looked\nsolid in all positions, and\nnever looked harassed\nthroughout the game. The\nfinal goal, following a quickly taken free-hit was scored\nby Dave Wilson, bringing his\nseason's tally to 12.\nThe semi-final of the U.L. Cup is due to be played on\n10th February against Guys\nHospital, but I.C. should not\nhave much trouble in reaching the final.\nI.C. W.S.C. do it again I.C. played themselves into the final of the Penney\nCup for the 4th year run-ning, giving one of their best\nperformances vet this season\nin beating R.H. C.3 \u20141, on\nSaturday, 30th January.\nAfter a he sistan t start by\nboth teams, Royal Holloway\nwere the first to find their\nGut te ridge Cup Royal Free Hospital 6 pts.; I. C.1st XV21 pts.\nOn Wednesday, 27th January I.C. won through to the\nsemifinals of the Gutteridge Cup (of which they are the\nholders) by decisively beating R.F. H. in a somewhat quiet\ncup match. Most of I.C's. points were scored by their No. 8,\nClive Swinnerton, who kicked four prodigious penalty goals.\nThe I.C. backs, supplied by plentiful balls from their\nhard-working forwards who ran hard and well, enabled\nleft winger Anderson to score twice to bring his tally for\nthe season so far to 18 tries. The other try was scored by\ncentre-cum-flanker Hunt, who turned in another fine display\nof powerful running and hard tackling.\nScrum half Stephenson spun out his celebrated passes\n(copied by a certain G.O. Edwards) even though hindered\nby a beautifully rounded beer pot! The front row must\nbe congratulated on their tactical (?) intimidation of their\nopposition\u2014they follow in the long line of ham-headed\nI. C.sc rummage rs.I. C. now meet U.C. in the semifinal on Wednesday, 17th February.\nTeam: D. Brownlee, R. Anderson, D. Conolly, J. Hunt, D. Marriott, A. James, T. Stephenson, D. Amos, H. Michael,\nP. Irvine, S. Owens, R. Mathews, C. Swinnerton, B. Hollingsworth, M. Adams (Capt).\nrhythm, but the pressure was\nremoved from a rather muddled I.C. defence by a good\nbreakaway goal by Chris\nCulshaw. The teams were\nwell-matched but only poor\nfinishing by I.C. prevented\nthem from being further\nahead at half-time.\nBeyond doubt\nHowever, early in the sec-on d half, some fine stick-work by Hilary Rowson resulted in her scoring the second goal. Although R.H. C. appeared to be losing heart,\nthey scored from a corner,\nbut a further goal by I.C. shortly afterwards put the\nresult beyond doubt.\nTeam:\nR. Newton; M. Diggens; J. Manfield; M.
