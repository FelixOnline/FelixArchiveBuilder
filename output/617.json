    "content": "Dear Mark\nOf course there is no truth in\nNick Morton's rumour (let-ter s, last week) that I have\nreceived a special medal \"awarded for sexual prowess\nat the AGM\". However great or small my\nprowess, I have always managed to contain it at Union Meetings.\nTours\nJ. Martin Taylor\n(Or was it MartinS. Taylor?)\nDear Mark\nIt really was marvellous to\nread a series of errors and\nmisconceptions in your letters\nsection rather than your news\nsection. I refer to the drivel\nwritten by Jeremy Nunns (not\nnoted for his well-informed\nopinions). I shall attempt to\nset poor little Jeremy straight.\nFirstly, the idea was not\nmine, but Don Monro's.I did\nnot commission a costing of\nthe scheme, but Student Residence Committee as a whole. The Halls are not keen\nto get involved in a central\nlaundry, they will be up grading their existing facilities. However, ICU Council is\nkeen to see a launder et te, even if a wash costs 50p, for\nmany people in College who\ndo not live in Hall. I have\ninformed the College authorities of this and it is being\nlooked into for us. Incidentally, if the Union moves to\nSouthside, it may be possible\nto incorporate a launder et te into the new plans.\nDirty old Jeremy seems\nconcerned about the aroma\ncaused by students who won't wash their sheets. What about\npeople who won't wash their\nclothes? Or themselves? But\nthen I wouldn't fancy washing\nJeremy Nunns. The points is\nthat two thirds of College students live out and have to\nwash their own sheets. This\nthey manage perfectly well\narid there has never been a dirty bed problem in the\nHead Tenancies where students look after themselves. I am sure Jeremy could soon\nchange that.\nThe serious question is, will\nit cost a student \u00a31 a week to\nwash his/her own linen? With\nbigger washing machines in\nHalls, it obviously won't. Two obvious options are either to\nwash the sheets with clothes\nor to get together with other\npeople on the landing and\nwash the whole lot together. I can see the latter option would be a problem for\nneighbours of trendy IC Radio disc-jockeys.\nFinally, I am non-plus sed by a petition from a third of\nthe residents of Southside.\nWhy? Because I haven't seen\nit. And where were they when\nI reported the matter to aUG M?I was going to report\nverbally to the first U GM this\nterm and actually had it\nwritten in Exec News for the\nAGM. However, nobody came so we formed no policy.\n. Instead Iam bound by Council policy which is\ndifferent to the ideas I first put\nto them. To canvass student\nopinion further, the Senior\nWarder (retiring) has agreed\nto ask new residents' opinions\non this matter on their acceptance forms.\nTours clean and wholesome\nNick Morton Dear Mark\nI must say it came as no\nsurprise to read those letters\nin last week's FELIX concerned with the Falklands crisis. The way in which they\nwere written does make one\nwonder about the intelligence\nof some people at IC. The\narguments against Mr Alexander's letter was predictable\nand repetitive.\nTo group everybody who is\nunhappy with the government's handling of this situation into one category\nand call them\" Ben nites\" shows some nai vit y; as does\nraising Maggie above an altar\nand worshipping her. This\ngovernment has not acted so\nmarvellously; even now there\nappears to be disagreement\nbetween Mrs Thatcher and\nMr Py m;Mr Py m does, I think, realise that the crisis is\nnot over once Britain has\nrecaptured the Falklands; meanwhile back bench Tories\nchant \"no sell-out\".\nAll three letters exclaimed\nthe virtues of self-de term i nation, but I thought that the\ngovernment had given up on\nthe idea that the will of the\nislanders was of paramount\nimportance? Where else in\nBritain does this occur? In\nNorthern Ireland a number of\npeople wish to belong to the\nRepublic of Ireland, but are\ntheir views heeded? No, you\nsay, they're in a minority! But\nas I understand it, no Argentinian is allowed to purchase\nland in the Falklands, so of\ncourse they wouldn't be able\nto support themselves, thus\nthe British maintain a major i ty; is that fair?\nOK, so we should condemn\nacts of aggression, like that of\nArgentina, but why does\neverybody jump to the trigger\nof a gun? I agree that we\nshouldst and up against aggression, but is violence the\nonly way?\nIt's about time people payed heed to UN decisions,\nand we can't expect Argentina\nto respect it unless responsible\ncountries, - like Britain, agree\nnot to rush into such a situation and sort it out\nthemselves.\nCouldn't the Falklanders\nhave suffered the presence of\nthe Argentinian troops for a couple of months while negotiations were in progress?\nSurely it would be less inconvenient for them than a war?\nMeanwhile, sanctions could\nbe imposed; we already had\nsubstantial backing from a number of countries. So, maybe there would be countries that broke the sanctions,\nlike the USSR, but if we also\nagreed to penal is e them then\na decision by the UN would\nbe more el lect ive. As the Pope has said, while\nin Britain, war is no longer a sensible or viable way of\nsettling international disputes;\nhe must be right, unless he's a Bennite.\nTours sincerely\nGraeme Shaw\nDear Sir\nWhat arrogant hypocrites\nsome people are!\nFor Mr Pettit's information,\nthe British are not a race\napart, and there can be few\ncountries that we don't share\nblood with by now. The Ar gies don't come from outer space, and are humans\ntoo. This may surprise Mr Reid, who does not sound\nsuch a 'nice guy\" himself\nanyway. I notice that none of\nthem offered to die themselves\n\u2014lack of 'guts' perhaps? If\nbeing patriotic means putting\nthe value of human life below\nthat of human greed, then the\nless patriots there are, the\nbetter. We all have to live in\nthis world \u2014 it belongs to\neveryone, not just the British.\nTo start a war may take\n'guts', but to prevent one\ntakes more than that\u2014clear\nsight and understanding, lack\nof arrogance, greed and selfishness, and a willingness\nto share the world with other\npeople. Britain does not have\nan automatic ( Mammon \u2014\ngiven?) right to rule the\nworld\u2014we are here on the\nsame terms as everyone else.\nThe UN are not at all convinced about Britain' s' right' to the Falklands anyway. The British abandoned the Falklands in 1774,\nas 'not worth defending', and\nthen the Spanish (from whom\nwe had taken them) used\nthem as a penal colony. After\nArgentina became independent from Spain, they claimed\nthem, in 1828. Britain re-took\nthem in 1833\u2014an act which\nthe Argies have always complained about. Which side\nwas right will probably never be discovered, but they\nare certainly as bad as each\nother. The UN has always\ntold Britain to discuss it with\nthe Argies, and Britain has\nalways refused\u2014not a very\ngood basis for antis is m, is it,\nMr Holt?\nThe Argies copied our own\nmethods exactly, even using\nBritish ships and guns. The\npatriots should, logically, be\npleased at such disgustingly\nBritish actions. This \"every-thing we do is right, but if you\ndo it it is wrong\" attitude\nsounds like \"some men are\nmore equal than others\".\nIf it is wrong for the Argies\nto do it, it was wrong when we\nContinued on page 4.\nPage 2 FELIX, June 4, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Polyester Certificate X Directed by John\nWaters Starring Divine, Edith Massey,\nTab Hunter.\nBad taste films acquire a bad smell in this, the\nlatest work of trash king John Waters. Starring\nonce more at the head of a team of wonderfully\nbad actors is obese transvestite Divine and the\nmarvellously un talented Edith Massey( a personal favourite).\nIn Polyester Mr Waters has taken the\ncarefree world of modern American housewives and turned it upside down. From the\nopening shot of a quiet suburban house,\nfollowed by the immense form of Divine (as\nFrancine Fishpaw) rolling out of bed, it is\nobvious that the bad taste has been glamorized a little.\nUnlike Waters' previous efforts ( which include the incredible Pink Flamingos) we are\ntreated to a fairly commercial package, including the gimmick of Odorama.\nThis isn't the first time a \"scratch'n 'sniff\"\ncard has been supplied with a film,\u2014but it is\ncertainly novel and works very well. Francine\nFishpaw is a normal American girl apart from\nher extra sensitive sense of smell. As we follow\nthe antics of Francine, her porn-king husband\nand her extraordinary family, numbers flash up\non the screen to signal a start to feverish\nscratching at correlating patches on your card.\nThe odour s are not always pleasant, but the\nmixture of anticipation and participation was\nso entertaining that it successfully drew\nattention away from flaws in the actual film.\nAs I have said, Waters has gone for an up-market, toned down version of his previous\nbad taste extravaganzas. In the process he still\nmanages to include a teenage disco maniac\ndaughter, a foot fetishist son, a millionaires s who was formerly Francine's cleaner (played\nby the ever delightful Edith Massey) and a sex\nmad secretary.\nFrancine is deserted by her husband (in\nfavour of the secretary) and she turns to drink.\nHer daughter gets pregnant and is taken away\nby cruel nuns, while her son is arrested as the\n\"Baltimore foot stomper\". After her world falls\napart, Francine starts to pick up the pieces\nwhen she meets the all American heart-throb\n(Tab Hunter) but things soon turn tragically\nwrong.\nPolyester may not be a great artistic achievement, but it certainly entertained the\naudience and managed to invert many of my\nvalues. There is no romance and beauty\u2014just\ncruelty, ugliness and some violence. But by the\nend of the film the bad taste became terribly\ncatchy and what John Waters wanted to say\nwas gradually becoming clearer.\nIf you liked any of Waters' other films then\nyou will certainly enjoy this. If you've never\nseen one, why not\u2014it could be worth the risk.\nMark Smith\nThe Jeweller's Shop by Pope John Paul II.\nDirected by Robin Phillips, Westminster\nTheatre.\nThe Jeweller's Shop was written by Karol\nWojty la in 1960 when he was Bishop of\nKrakow. It is one of half a dozen plays and is\na lyrical reflection on love and marriage. The\nplay is indebted to the author's poetry, and to\nhis past experience as co-founder and actor of\nan unusual theatre group during WorldWar II,\nthe Rhapsodic Theatre.\nThe three acts of the play deal with three\ncouples whose life stories are inter-twined. The\ntwo central characters in Act 3 are the children\nof the couples in the preceding two acts. The\nparts are supported by an unusually strong\ncast including Hannah Gordon, Lalla Ward, Paul Daneman, Christopher Blake and John\nCarson. The unifying thread running through\nthe three acts is a jeweller's shop, in whose\nwindow the couples see their marital future\nreflected. The jeweller is a mysterious god-like\nfigure whose scales weigh not the physical\nmass of wedding rings but their spiritual quality\nwhether of the past, present or future. The\nauthor's strong sense of destiny in the affairs of\nHannah Gordon (Theresa) in a scene from Pope\nJohn Paul's play The Jeweller's Shop at the\nWestminster Theatre.\nmen (and hence necessarily in marriage), and\nthe capacity of a married couple to 'reflect'\ntheir spiritual or divine nature (the resulting\ncombined reflection being much brighter than\nthe sum of their respective parts), is superbly\ncomplemented in the stage designs consisting\nof reflective panels bathing in receding perspectives of lines.\nContrary to what one might expect of a bishop's play Wojtyla approaches his theme\nwithout dogmatism or sermonizing. Nevertheless, the question that one must inevitably ask\noneself is this: if the author were not as\ncelebrated as he is, would his play be staged?\nThe answer is most definitely 'no'. Much of the\nplay consists of monologues, and the general\nlack of action makes the work thoroughly\nun theatrical. It would be much better suited\nfor radio presentation or preferably still, in\nbook form. The play may well appear to be\nbaffling, self-indulgent or wandering to people\nunfamiliar with the Pope and what he\nrepresents, but it is the sort of work which\ncertainly deserves quiet, unhurried meditation.\nHowever, the play at the Westminster Theatre\nwill probably draw crowds for some time to\ncome because of its very high curiosity value\nand the opportunity afforded of glimpsing the\npsyche of the world's most charismatic individual.\nNick Bedding\nPage 6 FELIX, June 4, 1982\n\n"

It\nis designed to bridge, at high level, the gap that exists between the design\nand engineering professions. The course can lead to the Master of Design\n(M Des) award of the Royal College and also to the Diploma of Imperial\nCollege (DIC).\nCandidates must possess a degree in engineering (or its equivalent),\nnormally at 2.2 or higher grade. Those with industrial experience are\nparticularly welcome. Evidence of creative and visual potential is also\nsought. A high level of motivation is essential.\nThe course is based on practical project work, supplemented by\nlectures in a wide range of design, engineering, management and cultural\nsubjects. After initial visual design training, the industrial design\nengineering students are integrated within RC A's School of Industrial\nDesign. This has proved to be of mutual benefit. The visually exciting and\ncreative environment of the Royal College, and the generous practical\nhelp received from the more experienced industrial design students has\nbeen of great value to the engineer. At the same time the engineers'\ncombination of self-discipline, stamina and searching objective\nquestioning has had a beneficial influence on the School and College.\nFirst Year project-work is oriented towards industrial design. In their\nsecond year the ID Eng students are encouraged to undertake a major\nproject with a substantia] engineering content and a 'design-make and\ntest' element, and so become eli gable for ICST's DIC award.\nI DEng students are provided with studio and model/prototype\nmaking facilities at the RCA, and test facilities, study space and more\nspecialised prototype facilities at Imperial College.\nStudents are free to follow their own line of development. Some\nbecome oriented more towards industrial design, some more towards\nengineering, others towards management. In some cases the students\nneed more time to develop their full potential in aesthetic design but the\noverall quality and depth of their work is very satisfactory indeed.\nDespite the pressures of this relatively intensive course the students are\nactive in School and College affairs, cultural events and the RC A's Design for Social Need programme. It is generally agreed that this course\nis attracting very high quality students.\nThis year'sID Eng Degree Show exhibits are expected to include:\nDevelopments in concrete frame machine tool design, and domestic\nspace heater (Sweeney); Domestic sewing terminal embodying radical\nnew principles (Tarn); Mobile X ray machine for hospital use (Lowe);\nWire rigging cutter with one-handed operation for emergency use on dismas ted yachts, and music stand (commissioned) (Douglas).\nFELIX, June 4, 1982 Page 5\n\n"

You can't have it both\nways. ( And there were no\nBritish living there when we\ninvaded, so you can't use that\nexcuse either). The Ar gies treated the Falklanders a lot\nbetter than the British treated indigenous populations. Most Falklanders live in\ntied cottages owned by British\nor Argentinian companies. They have to leave the island\nwhen they retire and the\nchildren have to leave at 15,\nwhen the education system\nends. Their jobs are all they\nhave to lose.

    "content": "Bull terrier goes missing Top job for Piggy!\nDr Bryan Levitt, Director of Undergraduate Studies in\nChemistry department, was elected as Mayor of the Royal\nBorough of Kensington and Chelsea last Thursday.\nDr Levitt, affectionately known as \"Piggy\" by the staff and\nstudents in Chemistry has been a Tory councillor for some\nyears and has lived in the borough since 1962. He is currently\nchairman of the Health and Housing Committee and was put\nforward by his party, who hold a majority on the council.\nATEN MONTH old English bull terrier Hed ' Jasper' has gone\nM an\u2014\nfence and when returned the dog mysteriously Kensington News & Post, Friday, May 28\nCalling Cards\nLast week details were finalised for the replacement of up to ten\nconventional pay ph on cs by the new Cardphone system telephones at\nvarious sites around the campus.\nThis is believed to be the first such installation on private property,\nsince up to now the system has only been available in Railway stations\nand other public sites. The installation would probably commence in\nOctober of this year, subject to the legendary lethargy of British\nTelecom (BT) engineers.\nThe agreement for the replacement, reached between BT representatives and a College negotiating team composed of Captain\nLindley, College Secretary John Smith and College Telephone Manager Peter Burridge, follows reportedly extensive abuse of the\nconventional telephones. Allegedly these have been used on many\noccasions for transferred charge long distance calls, and arc subject to\nmechanical tampering. The remaining conventional phones will soon\nbe strengthened to combat the latter problem, however.\nThe new system relies on plastic cards which are laser-etched to\nindicate the consumption of charge units. When a card is exhausted it\ncan simply be thrown away and a new one purchased. Add il on ally. the\nmicroprocessor-controlled card phones send a high frequency tone to\nthem, unless a card is inserted.\nThe cards would be sold at various sites, probably IC Bookshop and\nthe Southside Shop. Each card sold would give the College I0\"<> profit,\nbut because the rental for the card phones will be considerably higher\nthan for conventional phones, many cards would have to he sold to\ndefray the extra expense.\nWhat goes up.\nIt has been confirmed that the\npartition in the Union Lower\nLounge will be demolished when\nthe Union Lower Refectory is\nmoved to the Lower Lounge over\nthe summer vacation.\nA serving area is to be built at\nthe amusement machine end of\nthe Lower Lounge (consisting of\nthe heated trays and serving area\ncurrently used in the Lower Refectory) and the entrances to\nthe Lounge from the central staircase sealed to prevent use of\nthe eating area as a thoroughfare.\nNew kitchen facilities will be\nbuilt in the old cloakroom beneath the central staircase and a washing up area created at one\nend of the Union Bar store.\nIt is intended to have a range\nof furniture along the length of\nthe Lounge, changing from eating surfaces at the serving end\nto bar furniture at the other. It is\nestimated that only fifty or so\npeople will be able to eat at any\none time, but this is considered\nsufficient.\nThe sealing of the doors to the\ncentral staircase will make the\nLounge more of a room, with\nonly one entrance at the bar end.\nThe partition will be removed by\nworkmen, although several people have already offered donations to charity for the pleasure of striking the first blow.\nDear Mark\nMr Morton is the only person to have professed knowledge of the reason for\nmy resignation as Deputy President, but in fact he has\nno such knowledge. Whereas\nI would like to be able to say\nthat I'd been honest and resigned because I did not like\nthe job or because I could get\nmore money elsewhere, I did\nin fact, resign purely on principal: I was apparently\nresponsible for a shortfall in\nUnion income of \u00a33,000.\nOn resigning I was expecting to be asked to reconsider,\non the grounds of everything\nI 've done for ICU in the past,\nand that it was not entirely\nmy own fault that I was taken\nadvantage of by a vending\ncompany, etc., etc. But it did\nnot happen. I heard rumours\nthat the in quo rate Council I had left behind me (not the\nonly one!) had asked Mr Morton to ask me to recon-side r, but all he said was\n\" You don't have to do this\nyou know, Barney.\" Well, in\nthe face of this reaction, from\nsomeone with whom I was\nsupposed to continue working,\nand what with preserving honour etc., I had to go.\nI have been disappointed at\nthe recent petty vindictive\nreferences to me in FELIX. Have people forgotten that\nI 've contributed to life at IC over the last three years? I think not. There are just some\nwho care jealous of the fact\nthat I had the courage of my\nconvictions and left. I'm sorry,\nif I have let you or your readers down. It was with\ngreat regret that I made this\ndecision.\nI wish all who still care\nabout ICU the best of luck in\nkeeping it together.\nI wish all who came to get\ndegrees to get the best of\ndegrees.\nAs for me, well, I 've still got\nJill and one or two friends.\nThanks for a splendid 3 3\n/ 4\nyears at IC.

    "content": "The Penultimate Issue!\nThe next issue of FELIX, my last, will be on\nFriday, June18. The deadline for all\ncontributions (including small ads) is 5:30pm, Tuesday, June 8. This issue will take a full two\nweeks to prepare, so I hope you don't all piss\noff home before it's published.\nFELIX Rally\nWe've still got room for a few more teams to\ntake part in the FELIX Motor Rally on Sunday,\nJune 20. Clues will be set for various locations\nThe Shape of\nFELIX\nTo Come\nIt is traditional for the Editor-elect to make a statement of intent, either at the time he is\nelected or in the last FELIX before he takes\nover. I didn't write one last term, but the end of\nJune will be too late for the things I want to\nsay, so here goes\nThe style of a newspaper is the product of\ntwo factors: there is design, by which I mean\nlayout, typeface and use of space generally;\nand there is content. When Steve Marshall\ntookover as Editor two years ago he\ncompletely redesigned FELIX to the present\nformat. He did an excellent job. I think Mark\nwas wise not to alter it and, apart from\nredesigning the letters page, I don't intend to\neither.\nBut as far as the content of the newspaper\ngoes there are several things I want to say and\nmy reason for writing this statement of intent\nnow rather than at the end of term is to give\nyou plenty of time to comment on my plans\nbefore October when it will be too late.\nThe main point I want to make is that to be\ninteresting, FELIX must have support from its\nreaders. One of the things that really annoys\nme is the number of students who ridicule\n'another boring FELIX this week' on Friday\nmorning, and then do nothing for the rest of\nthe week. Contrary to popular belief, FELIX doesn't appear by magic and if the Editor isn't to spend all his time on the technical side of\nthings he needs the support and enthusiasm of\n(amongst others) photographers, cartoonists,\nreporters, colla tors, feature writers, news\nwriters and people to think up witty headlines\nat six o 'clock on Thursday.\nMore importantly, though, whenever anything newsworthy happens around College, we can't report it unless we know\nabout it first (strange but true!) and we're\ndependent on IC Stude and his lecturers and\nCollege staff to tell us. The reason we resort to\nspace-filling news stories (\"James Deeny Goes\nSwimming\") is often because the interesting\nthings which happen around College (and I'm certain that they do) never reach the FELIX\nOffice. The reason B.B. Wolffe's column hasn't in London as well as a list of \"treasure\" items\nto collect. Examples of previous questions can\nbe seen in the FELIX Office. Further details on\nrequest\u2014entries do not close until 9:00am on\nthe day when people gather for the start at the\nFELIX Office.\nFELIX Bound Editions\nIf by any chance you have the good taste to\nwant a presentation set of this year's issues,\nthey can be ordered from the office at a cost of\napproximately \u00a314.50. For this sum you receive a beautiful leather bound set, tastefully\nembossed with your own name in gold. I have\nsome full sets of copies or you can complete\nyour own collections if necessary.\nBrief Mention\nThe ACCA GM is at 6:30pm on Tuesday, June\n15.\nAlso Marco Ledwold tells me that anyone\ncan propose people for pots before Joint\nCouncil on June 21.\nCredits\nMany thanks for Nick Bleach of IC Radio,\nSoheel, David, Peter, Martin S., Steve, Jez and\nall the colla tors. appeared as regularly as we would like is that\nno one sells us the gossip which comes their\nway. If you want to see it in print, you've got to\ntell us about it.\nPep-talk over, let me get on to some specific\nplans for next year. Clubs and societies\narticles (with one or two notable exceptions)\nare dull. So many of them seem to say ' X Club\nhad a very interesting meeting last week.\nProfessor Y gave a talk on Z and next week\nsuch-and-such will take place.' Next year I'd like to replace these articles with an extended\nWhat'sOn column looking a little like the\nRadio Times: lots of information and a short\nreview of events with potentially wide public\nappeal (e.g. \u2014dare I say it \u2014 STOIC trans-missions) but a single line 'reminder' for\nregular events which are unlikely to attract\nanyone but regular attenders anyway (e.g. Dancing Club). Of course, if any club wants to\nwrite a long article or advertisement for a specific purpose (I know Dramsoc want to do\nthis to plug auditions) they are very welcome,\nespecially if they can back it up with photographs. But I do want to get rid of\narticles which are written just because the\nsociety has a publicity officer whose job is to\nwrite articles for FELIX.\nI'd like to have more humour in FELIX next\nyear, but this is likely to be difficult. Ridicule and\ncynicism are easy to produce but tend to pall\nafter a while, whereas clever satire and parody\nare difficult to write consistently well. Still, in\n7,000 students there must be a budding Alan\nCoren somewhere, mustn't there? Cartoonists\nare always welcome, too, of course.\nSoapbox will continue to provide space for\nthose who have something to say, and no\ndoubt the letters page will provide space for\nthose who don't. Incidentally, if potential\nSoapbox writers discuss their article with me\nbefore they write it, I 'll be happy to offer\nadvice on how to stop it looking like an\nu nap pet ising sea of grey print.\nTwo years ago FELIX used to print a summary of the week's national news, and this\nis a feature I am considering re-introducing.\nReactions of those I 've asked have been\nmixed; some think it valuable for those who\nhave neither time nor inclination to read daily\npapers, some think otherwise\u2014'If students\ncan't be bothered to get informed, they don't deserve to be.' What do you think?\nFinally, regretfully, I have realised that next\nyear is not going to allow me enough time to\ncontinue writing the Scaramouche column. I' mmm wMf fi Already people are expressing concern at the\nlack of cooperation between next year's Exec.\nAlthough all three members have opinions on\nthe important issues which will face the Union\nnext year, none has found out what the others\nfeel or made his own views known; indeed\nMary Freeman seems unaware of the existence Of the other Exec members.\nThere are two main decisions the Union is\nfacing next year; whether to move to\nSouthside and whether to hold a refectory\nboycott. As a public service, 1 have ascertained\nthe views of our three leaders-elect and, to\nnobody' s great surprise, they are not unanimously pro or con either of the schemes,\nalthough no one opposes both of them.\nIf Steve knew all so far revealed, and also\nPhil's opinion on the Southside move, he could\ndeduce all of Phil's and Mary's opinions. And if\nPhil knew all so far revealed, he could deduce\nMary's and Steve's opinions. So what do they\nall think?\nSolutions, comment, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please. \u00a35 (donated by Mend-a Bike) for the correct solution randomly\nselected at 1:00pm next Wednesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nA symmetric solution is shown in the diagram.\nNote that every grid line intersects exactly two\ndominoes; this is essential for the solution to\nwork. Keen mathematicians may like to work\nout why this is so, and extend the idea to show\nthere can be no fault-free tiling of a6 x6 square.\nThe prize was won by G.J. Rickard, Plasma\nPhysics PG, who was selected from thirty\nentrants.\nToo many complaints about easy puzzles,\nso this week's is designed to make you think a bit. But the next issue of FELIX will contain my\nlast bow: some very easy puzzles, some of\naverage difficulty\u2014and all the puzzles I 've\nbeen too merciful to set before. Prizes will be\nincreased in proportion to the difficulty. Don't miss it.\nvery keen to replace it with some sort of\nweekly puzzle or competition, though, so if\nyou have any ideas and especially if you'd consider taking over as puzzles editor then get\nin touch. I'll be happy to contribute occasionally, but a regular puzzle won't be\npossible.\nLastly, let me echo my first paragraph: all\nthis is still ideas and aspirations and the serious\nplanning doesn't start until I take over on July\n1. Whatever ideas, plans, criticisms you have\nin mind, I'm in and around the FELIX Office to\ndiscuss them most afternoons. But above all,\ntell me this term. I expect my plans to come in\nfor some criticism, but if they're criticised now\nI can amend them appropriately. Criticism in\nOctober will be too late.\nMartin S.

    "content": "mer enke J by Jean Racim\nBerenice by Racine. Directed by Christopher Fettes. Lyric Studio, Hammersmith.\nIt's exactly a year since Christopher Fettes\nshowed that classical French drama could be\nmade accessible to English audiences with his\nvivid production of Racine's Britannicus at the\nLyric Studio, Hammersmith.\nThe plot of Berenice is of classical simplicity.\nAntiochus, a King, loves Berenice, Queen of\nPalestine, who in her own turn'loves the newly\nanointed Emperor Titus. The parts are played\nrespectively by Peter Eyre, Sheila Gish and\nMartyn Stanbridge. But because the Romanlaws forbid the Emperor to marry a foreigner,\nTitus smothers his helpless love for the Queen\nin favour of his duty to the state. At the play'send, the three depart from each other,\nregretfully and tragically.\nRacine wrote his play to be performed in full\nLouis XIV rig, with tro cade coats, ceremonial\narmour and sumptuous dresses. The production at the Lyric, however, is in modern\ndress with a simple but smart set. The play is\nformal and rhetorical but is imbued with an austere elegance. The passionate and emotional intensity of the play is kept Garfield Morgan and Martyn Stanbridge in a scene from Racine's Berenice, at the Lyric\nStudio,\nmarvellously under rein by the restrained,\ndignified rhetoric. The play's characters are\nprey to their passions, yet they can analyse\ntheir struggles in speech which dissects as\nclar ly as a knife.\nThe play is well worth witnessing but you\nneed to be in a relaxed, attentive mood to\nappreciate and enjoy it.\nNick Bedding\nGeorge Orwell A Life by Bernard Crick,\nPenguin \u00a32.95 (paperback).\nThis is an excellent book. Bernard Crick is a professor of politics and he writes pompously,\nbut any book about George Orwell is almost\ndoomed to look wordy and too full of waffle\nbecause you'll inevitably compare it with what\nOrwell himself might have written. The style of\nthe book is too long winded( The questions are\nnot wholly se per able', etc.) which partly\nexplains the book's length: five hundred and\neighty pages, not counting' the appendices,\nnotes, index, and the good selection of\nphotographs. But it's very readable, Prof\nCrick's done about as good a job on Orwell's biography as you could reasonably expect.\nThe account of his life is fairly complete and\ndetailed, including the chapters on Orwell's childhood, a part of people's lives that\nbiographers tend to skip. The only serious\nfault of the book is that too many speculations|\nabout minor features of Orwell's life and work\nwhich are hardly worth theories at all. (For\nexample at the age of eighteen Orwell, or Eric\nBlair as he then was, bought a cage rat trap\nand Crick says \"Thus Blair brought the cage\nthat eventually was thrust at the face of\nWinston Smith in Nineteen Eighty Four). i The most important question about a biography of a writer is, does it give you a better understanding of his character than you\ncan get from reading his own works? The\nanswer for this book is definitely yes. You can\nfind out a lot about Orwell, in his own books\nand essays but here are features of his\npersonality, particularly his attitude to women,\nthat are brought out much more clearly in this\nbiography. The most unexpected part of the\nbook is the description of Orwell's almost\npitiful efforts to get some woman to marry him\nafter the death of his first wife. He made\nclumsy proposals to women he hardly knew\nand wrote them embarrassing letters after they\nturned him down. Of course this (and a lot of\nthe rest of the book) is interesting partly\nbecause of the ordinary nosey pleasure of\nreading other people's letters, but it is\nsomething of a revelation. It may even have\nbeen partly the reason why he asked for no\nbiography of himself to be written. Crick doesn't discuss this request at all, which seems\na strange omission. \u2022\nAll in all the biography is good and readable,\nassuming you're interested in George Orwell\nat all.\nN. Willson\nCricket\nA merry band of IC cricketers again- took to\nthe Northern Line, this time ending up at\nCollindale. Phil Eastland tore down the hill\nand made a good impression of a fart in a force ten. Fortunately Bill H in mers was\nthrowing the ball up the hill. For once it\ntravelled in the correct direction \u2014 the\nreasons appeared to be the similarity to the\nveld in long lost Zimbabwe and the lack of\nany darker skinned brothers. Masher finished\na useful spell with a piece of play acting that\nKevin Keegan would have been proud of.\nThe result being that the possible jug of beer\nwas not forthcoming.\nBefore the ensuing batting collapse, the\nperformances of Phil Nicholls and Phil Crawford Smith should be mentioned. Although both looked menacing dressed in\nwhite there was a tendency for knock-ons and\nattempts to control any flying object and boot it into touch. Phil Nicholls also reported\nthat Frank's rash persists through the summer months.\nThe batters failed miserably as usual. The\nonly part success being 'Plug' Hobbs who,\nplaying with half an ear, managed to\ncontribute the most to the fines pot. We won,\nit was a sunny day, Villa won, the fines pot\ndid well\u2014who cares about quiz es!
