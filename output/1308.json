    "content": "I Heart Huckabees is one bizarre\nfilm. I was confused. I was happy.\nI was bored. I was excited. I don\u2019t\neven know where I stand with this\nfilm. I could give it one star. I could\ngive it five stars.\nIt has to be five stars though. Yes,\nit\u2019s quirky, but it\u2019s original and wonderfully refreshing. It\u2019s a philosophical film and a simple philosophy at\nthat: \u201chope versus despair, and light\nversus dark\u201d.\nI Heart Huckabees has an outstanding cast, who seemed to click\ntogether through the eccentricity\nof their characters. It is a deep and\nmeaningful comedy that has made\nphilosophy funny and entertaining.\nThe philosophical aspect concerns\nthe idea of existentialism, a thinking\nof uniqueness and isolation of the\nindividual experience in a hostile\nor indifferent universe; it regards\nhuman existence as unexplainable.\nThese are the kind of ideas that\nkeep you up all night, wondering\nwhat it all means.\nThe story follows the not particularly successful environmentalist Albert Markovski (Jason\nSchwartzman). Through a series\nof coincidences, he is brought to\na happy husband and wife duo \u2013 a\ndetective team who help others to\nsolve their existential issues. Vivian\n(Lily Tomlin) and Bernard (Dustin\nHoffman) portray these slightly\nabnormal characters excellently.\nTheir idea is to stalk Albert ridiculously unsubtly to find clues to what\nmakes him tick, their philosophy\nbeing that life is like a blanket of\nfibres of interconnecting existence\nwhere everything is related.\nAlbert\u2019s job is to protect a plot of\nland that the Huckabees department store cooperation is planning to build on. He\u2019s doing a poor\njob and corporrate charmer Brad\nStrand (Jude Law) steps in to do\nsomething about it. There is a love/\nhate relationship between Albert\nand Brad, which is fun to watch on\nthe screen. Albert is also introduced\nto Tommy Corn (Mark Wahlberg),\nanother client of the existential\nagency, and they connect imme-diately. Wahlberg makes an excellent side kick, a 9/11 fire-fighter\nwith an anti-petroleum obsession.\nHe makes you laugh in every scene\n\u2013 without him, this film wouldn\u2019t\nhave been half as funny.\nAlbert and Tommy fall into the\nhandsofCatherine,aFrenchauburn\nsex goddess (I couldn\u2019t really see\nthat myself), who was an ex-pupil\nof Bernard and Vivian gone wrong.\nShe has formed the opposite theory\nto Bernard\u2019s: \u201cLife is meaningless\nand valueless, a world of random\nchaos where values are arbitrary\u201d.\nPerhaps her theory will work?\nI Heart Huckabees is an unpredictable ride. It is not a film for\nthe conventional person. All the\ncharacters are the extreme of a\ncertain stereotype. Brad is the\n\u2018always happy at work but not on\nthe inside\u2019 corporate. His girlfriend\nDawn Campbell (Naomi Watts), the\npretty spokesmodel of Huckabees,\nis the \u2018all looks and no brains\u2019 kind\nof girl. Plus there\u2019s the eccentric\nenvironmentalist, Albert, who likes\nto write poems. This is a film to\nmake you really think \u2013 it is not\na good movie for those seeking\nmindlessentertainment. There are\nhidden meanings that will bewilder\nand will go over the head of some\nviewers.\nI was baffled to begin with, as the\nstory is surreal, and has a strange\nplot. Some, like those who walked\nout of the film when I watched it,\nmay find it hard to keep up with.\nHowever, there are some extraordinary ideas and some extraordinary\ncharacters, which are all played so\nwell, that just make me love this\nfilm in the most absurd way. It\u2019s also\none for the girls with the likes of\nJude Law and Mark Wahlberg. You\nmay as well stay and watch, even if\nit\u2019s just for them.\nMelissa Parkinson\nWe love Huckabees\nOriginality and weirdness prevail in David O Russell\u2019s quirky, existential comedy on life\u2019s\nprofound questions\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004\n22\nI Heart Huckabees\nDirector: David O Russell\nStarring: Naomi Watts, Jason\nSchwartzman, Jude Law,\nMark Wahlberg, Dustin Hoffman\nLength: 107 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHHH\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe all-star cast is put to good use in one of the year\u2019s most unique movies\n\u201cThese are the kind\nof ideas that keep you\nup all night, wondering what it all means\u201d\nBridget Jones\ngiveaway\nCourtesy of the wonderfully generous management at Vue Fulham\nBroadway, there are ten Bridget\nJones: The Edge of Reason posters\nto be won.\nSimply answer the easy question:\nWho plays Bridget?\nEmail your answers to\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004\n10\nLast week\u2019s article, \u2018Animal testing:\na necessary or unnecessary evil\u2019,\nprovides some useful information\nbut, as usual, sees the issue from a\nmyopic human perspective.\nAnimal testing and factory farming are just examples of our arrogance as human beings. We, for\nsome nonsensical reason, declared\nourselves the rulers of the Earth\nand therefore empowered ourselves\nwith the choice of who lives and who\nis dispensable, of what is useful and\nwhat is not.\nPerhaps religion is partly to blame\nfor the misconception that the Earth\nwas made for man. This attitude\nis largely responsible for the environmental problems we face today,\nas everything on Earth is assigned\na value according to our \u2018needs\u2019\nand wants, despite our incapability\nto fully comprehend the complexity\nand beauty of nature. It is this same\nattitude that led us to conclude that\nhumans are more important than\nother species and therefore it is\nalright for us to use them as test\nsamples.\nThe article talks about intrinsic\nvalue. Do humans really have more\n\u2018intrinsic value\u2019? Intrinsic value to\nwhom? As far as I am concerned,\nthe biggest danger that faces me\nis the human being. Perhaps the\natrocities committed in the last\ncentury, those that continue to be\ncommitted today even by \u2018civilised\u2019\nwesterners, the slow and steady\ndestruction of my habitat and more\nexplain why.\nThe fact that humans have collectively created enough weapons to destroy themselves 10 to 15\ntimes over says something. On the\ncontrary, the contribution of other\nspecies to the world we live in is\nimmeasurable. Each living being,\nfrom the bees that pollinate our\ncrops to the trees that clean the\nair, form an integral part of the ecosystem without which there would\nbe no \u2018us\u2019. Humans, on the other\nhand, have done nothing but progressively destroy the environment,\nwhich is perhaps more important\nthan anything. It is all that we leave\nbehind that is of any real impor-tance. Without it, there can be noth-ing, no \u2018us\u2019 and no \u2018them\u2019.\nThe fact that we even have to ask\nwhether animal testing is traumatic\nfor animals and whether they feel\nmuch astounds me. It is common\nknowledge, and frankly open for everyone to observe, that other species\nhave very strong bonds with their\nspecies and with nature, perhaps\nstronger than humans. They certainly don\u2019t make enemies as easily\nas we do. Also, their sensory powers\nare usually stronger than those of\nhumans and they would therefore\nbe adversely effected by an artificial\nlaboratory environment. If you add\nto this the fact that they have no\nidea of what is being done to them\nor why, it makes you feel rather sick\ninside.\nAs far as alternatives are con-cerned, just test the products on\nhumans. Human testing is necessary before a drug enters the market anyway; it is just cheaper, easier\nand quicker to test drugs on animals\nfirst. The introduction of in vitro\nstudies is perhaps another option.\nSo what if we have to wait a bit\nlonger? Maybe if drug companies\nlike GlaxoSmithKline spent more\ntime on useful drugs than on bogus\nfashionable drugs like Seroxat we\nwould have more progress.\nPerhaps this is stretching it, but is\nit not the same kind of indifference\nwe show towards animals who don\u2019t\nlook or talk or act like us that we\nshow towards tens of thousands of\npeople dying in a foreign land whose\nsuffering is so easily put at the back\nof our minds? But when a comparatively insignificant number of our\n\u2018own\u2019 people die, we make a whole\nlot of noise. How much will it take\nfor us to start thinking and feeling?\nShow mercy to animals?\nWho are we to decide?\nVeer Singh responds to last week\u2019s Felix Science article on animal testing\nBy Dave Arquati\nMy last article was about transport\nproblems. This time, I\u2019m writing\nabout some changes.\nThe first change could affect every\nsingle student and staff member at\nImperial\u2019s South Kensington cam-pus. All London-based readers will\nknow about the congestion charge,\nwhere motorists \u00a35 per weekday to\ndrive within a zone covering most of\ncentral London. The current western boundary runs down Edgware\nRoad and Park Lane, but there are\nproposals to extend the zone to\nEarl\u2019s Court, putting Imperial inside\nthe charging zone.\nThis has local businesses concerned about a decrease in passing\ntrade. The only consolation for them\nat the moment is that studies of the\ncentral charging zone have indicated that, overall, there has only been\na small effect on businesses.\nBut what does it mean for\nImperial? Well, anyone driving a\ncar to College would face a hefty\nbill. However, I doubt that applies\nto most people, as Imperial staff\nand students tend to walk, cycle, or\ncatch the bus or tube.\nIf you use the tube, the proposed\nextension probably wouldn\u2019t affect\nyou much, since the expected\nnumber of extra passengers is very\nsmall. However, there\u2019s good news\nfor everyone else. Pedestrians and\ncyclists should experience a more\npleasant environment as traffic volumes would decrease. Bus users\nwould probably see the biggest\nbenefits \u2013 reduced journey times\nthanks to reduced traffic, and higher frequencies and more routes as\na result of the money made from\ncharging (estimated to be an extra\n\u00a310m).\nSpeaking of buses, you may have\nnoticed the iconic old Routemaster\nbuses going the way of the dodo.\nThey are being replaced by more\nmodern low floor buses, partly to\ncomply with new regulations on\naccess for the disabled.\nThis means the retirement of the\nRoutemaster in favour of modern\ndouble deckers or bendy buses. This\nhas been very unpopular, especially\ngiven the spontaneous combustion\nof some bendy buses a few months\nago. However, resistance seems to\nbe futile, and the replacement of\nRoutemasters on route 19 through\nChelsea has been announced for\nApril. All other Routemaster-operated routes are on death row, but\nmany will be pleased that no execution date has been announced for\nSouth Kensington\u2019s route 14 yet.\nMy final word this time is on\nOyster. Many of you use it, and, this\nbeing Imperial, some of you may\neven have wondered how it works.\nBasically, an Oyster reader induces\na response in a card by using a\ncertain radio frequency. What you\nmay not have realised is that information on your season ticket or pre-pay, and on the recent journeys you\nhave made, is stored on the card\nitself. This is the only way it can\nwork on buses, which aren\u2019t connected to a central network except\nat depots.\nStarting next year, for pre-pay\nusers, this journey information\nwill be used in a system known as\n\u2018capping\u2019, where you will only be\ncharged up to a maximum daily fare.\nFor example, if the cost of your bus\njourneys in a day exceeds the price\nof a bus pass, the amount you pay\nwill be capped at the cost of the bus\npass. It will work the same way for\ntravelcards.\nHowever, it won\u2019t be so easy to\nwork out yourself \u2013 next year, there\nwill be different bus fares for the\nmorning peak, and lower tube fares\nin very early mornings, at evenings\nand at weekends. You\u2019ll just have to\n\u201ctrust thy Oyster\u201d.\n\u25cf Dave Arquati runs the website www.alwaystouchout.com\nand is a third year biochemistry student at Imperial College\nTransport\ntransformation\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

The challenger,\nViktor Yushenko, is a liberal\nwho has strong support in\nthe west (of the world and the\ncountry).\nThe elections, in which the\nofficial results were 49.6% to\n46.6%, were criticised by the\ninternational observers, and\nthe results were denounced\nby leaders around the world.\nThe result sparked off a mass\nriot and close to a civil war\nin which hundreds of thousands of protestors filled\nthe frozen streets to barricade Parliament and the\nPresident\u2019s residence until\nthe decision was debated by\nthe High Court. The stakes\nwere raised when Colin\nPowell, still acting as US\nSecretary of State despite\nhis resignation, announced\nthat Washington \u201ccould not\naccept\u201d the results and was\nprepared to withhold $150\nmillion in annual aid until it\nwas sorted out. This was not\npopular with President Putin,\nwho sees Ukraine as very definitely part of his area of influence and not America\u2019s.\nThis was a favourite story\nof The Independent all week,\nunsurprisingly as it focuses\nso strongly on international\nnews. There were some amazing pictures in the paper of\nprotestors placing flowers in\nthe shields of the riot police,\nin a demonstration where\nthey wished to act peacefully.\nThe Telegraph also devoted a fair bit of space to the\nstory, saying that \u201cthe crowds\nbehind Mr Yushchenko are to\nbe congratulated for challenging a corrupt system within\nUkraine and Mr Putin\u2019s blatant attempt to influence the\nresult from without... their\n\u2018orange people power\u2019 has\nrocked a corrupt, devious\nand retrograde establishment without the fatal consequences visited on rebels\nagainst Soviet rule during the\nCold War or on democracy\ndemonstrators in Tiananmen\nSquare 15 years ago. Thanks\nto them, Ukraine now has a\nchance of fulfilling the democratic promise offered by\nindependence in 1991\u201d.\nThe Guardian points\nout that the interference\nin the election by both the\nAmericans and the Russians\nsmacks of the Cold War, and\nsaysthatwhichevercandidate\nthey choose, the Ukrainians\nmust be the ones with the\nfinal say. They also point out\nthat Mr Yushchenko was part\nof the same government as\nthe Prime Minister and so\nthe situation is not as clear\ncut as one would like: \u201cNo\none comes away from this\ngame with completely clean\nhands\u201d. Although the situation in Ukraine is far from\ndecided, it is thought that\nthere will be rerun elections,\nprovided both men say that\nthey will trust the results a\nsecond time.\nAlso abroad, but concerning Britain, was the decision\nby the England Cricket Board\n(ECB) and players to (grudg-ingly) continue with their tour\nof Zimbabwe, provided that\nthey are never put in a situation where they may have\nto shake hands with government officials or President\nRobert Mugabe.\nThe newspapers were generally scathing about this,\nespecially after the attempt by\nthe Zimbabwean authorities\nto prevent the entry of sports\njournalists into the country.\nThe Independent compared\nthe entry of the cricketers to\nthe simultaneous deportation\nof aid workers from the coun-try, while The Mail called the\nmatches the \u201ctour of shame\u201d\nand said that the only reason they are going is to avoid\nfinancial damage to the ECB.\nThe Telegraph and The\nGuardian reported how the\nplayers themselves did not\nwant to go but were let down\nonce again by poor leader-ship, having been put between\na rock and a hard place. All of\nthe papers are, it seems, united with the players in hoping\nthe tour is over as quickly as\nis humanly possible.\nInternational interest\nA look at the week\u2019s developments in Ukraine and Zimbabwe\nBy John Collins\nLast Wednesday, an estimated 1500 students attended\nthis year\u2019s highly successful\nCity & Guilds College Union\nInternship Fair, which for\nthe first time took place in\nthe College main entrance\nnear the Tanaka Business\nSchool and in the foyer of\nthe mechanical engineering\nbuilding.\nThe entirely volunteer-run Internship Fair, now in\nits third year, is an excellent\nopportunity for non-final-year undergraduates to meet\nrecruiters and organisations\noffering a range of options\nfor students to obtain work\nin the summer. Engineering\nfirms, banks, professional\nservice firms, research stu-dents, careers advice staff,\nalumni representatives and\ncharities offering placements\nin the third world were all on\nhand to advise students of\ntheir many opportunities for\nsummer work.\nSenior College staff,\nincluding the new Faculty of\nEngineering Principal, Dr\nJulia King, dropped in to lend\ntheir support for what has\nbecomethelargestInternship\nFair so far.\nThe C&G Internship Centre\nCoordinator, second year\nchemical engineering student\nAnne Baarup, said that she\nwas delighted with the high\nattendence of both employers\nand students, and has many\nideas on how to improve what\nis fast becoming CGCU\u2019s\nmost popular annual event.\nInternship Fair\ncomes to Tanaka\nViktor Yanukovych, current\nPresident of Ukraine\nStudents fill the foyer of the mechanical engineering\nbuilding during the recent Internship Fair\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nNATO\n\n"

    "content": "Did you go to the ICSO concert last\nFriday? Those of you who did I\u2019m\nsure will agree with me that it was\na very enjoyable evening. For those\nof you who didn\u2019t, here\u2019s the review\nof what you missed. And for those\nof you who are already well and\ntruly lost: ICSO stands for \u2018Imperial\nCollege Symphony Orchestra\u2019.\nThe programme was as follows:\nBerlioz Roman Carnival Overture;\nSibelius Finlandia; Larsson\nConcertino for Trombone; and\nTchaikovsky Symphony No.6. After\na brief moment of \u2018tisk tisking\u2019 from\ngeneral public and the orchestra as\nsomeone\u2019s phone started buzzing,\nthe concert got underway with the\nbright and exuberant Berlioz.\nThe Berlioz was well executed and\nserved as a good introduction to\nthe evening\u2019s concert. The Roman\nCarnival Overture was originally\nwritten as the overture to a rather\nunsuccessful opera but has thankfully survived. The piece is upbeat\nand enjoyable, opening with a\nbeautiful cor anglais solo played by\nCharles Craddock.\nThe Berlioz was followed by\ntwo pieces by Nordic composers,\nSibelius and Larsson. Quite possibly\nFinland\u2019s most well known export,\nSibelius is the composer of some\nhighly emotive music. I\u2019ll be completely frank and admit that Sibelius\nreally isn\u2019t one of my favourite composers \u2013 his works are quite often\nthat little bit too emotive for my\ntastes and scored in such a way that\nmore often that not result in my\nturning a lovely shade of greenish\ngrey and reaching for the Panadol.\nHowever, the work played by ICSO,\nFinlandia, was wonderfully dark\nand brooding and played to perfec-tion; it almost made me want to\ngive Sibelius another chance. The\nexpression of nationalistic sentiments of the composer and the people of Finland at a time when the\ncountry was under the control of\nRussia, Finlandia is a gloriously\ngrand tone poem.\nHands up those of you familiar\nwith the works of Larsson. As I\nexpected, not many. Larsson, 1908\u2013\n1986, is a Swedish composer whose\nwork was influenced by, among oth-ers, Sibelius. The Concertino for\nTrombone is a true showpiece for\nthe soloist, in this instance Douglas\nMurdoch, who covered himself in\nglory playing music of astounding\ncomplexity. Apologies to all trombonists out there, but I had no idea\nwhat the instrument was capable\nof!\nFollowing a brief interval, ICSO\nrearranged themselves once more\nto embark on the concert\u2019s grand\nfinale, Tchaikovsky\u2019s Symphony\nNo.6 \u2018Path\u00e9tique\u2019 in B minor. Not\na joyous and triumphant work, the\nTchaikovsky is singularly beautiful\nand melancholy. Elegant, as all of\nTchaikovsky\u2019s works are, the symphony was done complete justice by\nICSO\u2019s players, the brass in particular shining. The fortes were boom-ing, the crescendos were sweeping,\nthe decrescendos and pianos heart-breaking.\nThe conducting of Richard Dickins\nwas as full of energy as usual and\nraised quite a few comments of concern from my companions for both\nhis safety and that of the assorted\npieces of sound equipment in the\nvicinity. ICSO really did themselves\nproud with this concert, as was patently evident by the stupendously\nlow level of coughing and sneezing\nfor the time of year. I realise that\nthis is something of a useless com-ment, but it was about time that\nthe squeaky green stool the timpani\nplayer was perched on was replaced,\nso well done to the person who took\ncare of that \u2013 now we can all enjoy\nconcerts without those occasional\nunpleasant squeaks.\nThe quality of the concert was\nextremely high, the repertoire\nenlightening and extremely enjoy-able. Those of you who didn\u2019t go\nreally missed out on this tour de\nforce by ICSO.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nICSO on tour in Paris.

We\nkicked ass\u201d\nAn ICSO string player, who wishes to\nremain anonymous, on the first half\nImperial College\nSymphony Orchestra\nFriday 26 November\nGreat Hall\nBerlioz, Sibelius, Larsson, Tchaikovsky\nYou can do all that on a trombone?\nWe review the ICSO concert so you know what you missed out on\nThe closest I have ever been to\nbeing \u2018musical\u2019 was playing the\nrecorder in my school concert aged\n13, and that wasn\u2019t even classical. So\nI\u2019m writing this review in the eyes of\na non-musician, someone who was\nthere simply to watch their friends\nplay and enjoy the music.\nSt Augustine\u2019s Church is an amazing venue, and the music filled it.\nThe Imperial College School of\nMedicine (ICSM) Orchestra looked\nthe part in their matching black\noutfits and I knew we would be in\nfor a treat. Matt Whitaker conducted\nthe orchestra and this ambitious\nprogramme. This is his second year\nconducting them, and it was obvious\nthat he was enjoying the perform-ance.\nDanse Macabre by Saint-Saens\nwas the first piece to be played.\nAny other non-musicians will know\nthis as the theme tune to Jonathan\nCreek. However, Danse Macabre\nplayed by the ICSM Orchestra in a\nmagnificent church made the music\nsound 100 times better than on the\ntelly. It was an incredible first piece\nand it sent shivers running down\nmy spine.\nDanse Macabre is one of four\nsymphonic poems. It is an example\nof the exotic, descriptive and dramatic works written by Saint-Saens,\na French pianist and composer. He\nwas hailed as the world\u2019s greatest\norganist by Gounod, Rossini, Berlioz\nand Listz. Zoe Little was the soloist\nin this piece, and she excelled in her\npart on the violin. Danse Macabre is\na fantastic piece and the orchestra\ndid it justice.\nMendelssohn\u2019s Violin Concerto in\nE minor gave an end to the first half\nof music. This was a elegant piece\nwith a large focus on the soloist\nOlivia Shields, a second year medic\nwho began her violin career at the\nage of four and was a finalist in The\nNational Schools Chamber Music\nCompetition. She led the symphony\norchestra for two successive years\nat St Paul\u2019s Girls\u2019 School and studies with Rodney Friend at the Royal\nCollege of Music. She is amazing.\nThis piece is very challenging for\nthe soloist as it contains an undercurrent of agitated semiquavers.\nBut I could see no faults in her or\nthe orchestra\u2019s performance. It was\na lovely piece to listen to.\nAfter the interval of wine\nand orange juice, we listened to\nTchaikovsky\u2019s Symphony No.5,\ncomposed in the summer of 1888.\nIn this excellent final piece, the\nclarinets gave a low and sombre\ntheme. Tchaikovsky transforms his\nfate theme into a triumphant march\nand a happy ending. It was an epic\nexpression of music and energy, a\nsound ending to the concert.\nThe medics put on an excellent display of music, and Zoe and\nOlivia\u2019s solos gave a particular sparkle to the performance. I was literally gobsmacked when they played.\nHow does someone do a medicine\ndegree and manage to be that\ngood? It\u2019s outstanding. Matthew\nkept the orchestra together, and\nthat\u2019s a large task.

    "content": "All it takes is a small change of\nhabit. It\u2019s not hard. In fact, many of\nyou will find it common sense. When\nyou want to buy chocolate, coffee,\ntea, muesli etc, make sure that you\nbuy the Fairtrade option.\nThat\u2019s it. No more thought\nrequired, no more effort on your\npart. Get into that habit and you can\nsupport a hugely important campaign having a wide-ranging impact\nupon third world farmers and their\nfamilies.\nFairtrade is a simple idea, but with\nfar-reaching consequences. When\nyou buy normal coffee, the farmer\nwho grew the coffee beans gets only\na small fraction of what you pay. At\nthe moment, a non-Fairtrade coffee farmer can expect to receive\nabout \u00a338 per 45kg bag of green\ncoffee beans, whereas a farmer\nwho is a member of the Fairtrade\nOrganisation can expect about \u00a368\nper bag. A huge difference, you will\nagree.\nFarmers join into cooperatives\nand sell directly to the supplier,\neffectively cutting out the middleman and greatly increasing the\nprice they receive for their produce.\nThis enables them to negotiate a\nfair price for their goods, which\nguarantees them a sustainable living and the support to develop their\nbusinesses.\nWhen you buy goods with the\nFairtrade logo on, you know that a\ngood proportion of the price you pay\nwill go directly to the producers.\nThe main issue now is creating a demand for Fairtrade goods.\nFairtrade is the fastest growing\nsegment of the UK coffee market,\nbut there is still so far to go. By\nasking for the Fairtrade option next\ntime you wander into Costa, you\nshow your support for an ethical\ncuppa and put pressure on the coffee companies to move to Fairtrade\nstatus.\nAs well as buying Fairtrade pro-duce, there is more than can be\ndone to raise awareness and show\nsupport for the Fairtrade Movement.\nThereisacampaignstartingoncampus to make Imperial a Fairtrade\nUniversity.\nA Fairtrade University is one\nthat meets the five criteria set out\nbelow:\n\u25cf First, the students\u2019 union and\ncollege create a Fairtrade policy\nincorporating the five aims\n\u25cf Fairtrade foods are sold in all\nshops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and bars\non campus. Where this isn\u2019t possi-ble, there is a commitment to begin\nusing Fairtrade foods as soon as\npossible\n\u25cf Fairtrade foods (such as coffee\nand tea) are served at all meetings hosted by the College and the\nUnion\n\u25cf There is a commitment to campaign for increased consumption of\nFairtrade goods on campus\n\u25cf A Fairtrade Steering Group is\nestablished, consisting of representatives from catering, the College,\nthe Union executive, an appropriate\nstudents\u2019 union society and each\nassociated institution.\nOnce these five aims have been\nrealised, the Steering Group is\nresponsible for sending a report to\nthe Fairtrade Foundation for status\nto be awarded.\nNot only would Fairtrade\nUniversity status increase the levels\nof ethical consumption at Imperial\nand raise awareness of the issue,\nbut it would help to establish the\nhabit of Fairtrade purchasing in\ngenerations of young student con-sumers. It would set an example to\nother universities and gain Imperial\nthe reputation of a university with a\nworld view, able to look beyond the\noften insular world of science and\nthe dubious clutches of the City.\nThere is a College Catering\nReview at the start of next term,\nwhich will provide an ideal opportunity to change policy for the better.\nA petition will be starting next week\naround campus to support Fairtrade\nstatus. Please sign it.\nIn conjunction with the Chaplaincy,\na stall will be up around campus providing more information, and tasters of Fairtrade goods and Fairtrade\nevents around London will be adver-tised. The campaign is in its early\nstages, so if you would like to give\nyour support, please send an email to\nimperialfairtrade-subscribe\n@yahoogroups.co.uk to join the\nmailing list.\nEven just an hour of your time to\nhelp with the petition will make a\ndifference.\nAnd finally, there is a Fairtrade\nFair on 3 and 4 December at the\nEmmanuel Centre in Westminster.\nThis will be a great opportunity for\nethical Christmas present buying\nand to show that Christmas really\ndoes mean thinking about others, if\nyou\u2019ll forgive the cheesy line.\nFairtrade: what\u2019s it all about?\nImperial should become a Fairtrade University as soon as possible, says Jamie Brothwell\nNo-one can have failed to have\nnoticed the increase in recycling\nfacilities being offered to householders by their local councils. Orange\nsacks, green bags, black crates,\ngreen bins \u2013 a multicoloured cornucopia of waste disposal alternatives on your doorstep. There\nis even a newspaper bin outside\nSouth Kensington tube station! And,\nof course, there is a Government\ncampaign to get us all recycling.\nBut why this sudden interest in\n\u2018waste\u2019 and how does it affect life at\nImperial?\nYou don\u2019t have to be au fait with\nenvironmental legislation to realise that things are afoot in the\nworld of waste. The EU-initiated\nLandfill Directive requires increasing amounts of waste to be diverted\naway from landfill disposal, and new\nlegislation affecting individual waste\nstreams will soon be implemented.\nFor example, the Waste Electrical\nand Electronic Equipment (WEEE)\nDirective will require the separate\ncollection and treatment of all electrical equipment before disposal \u2013 or\nelse fines will be issued if targets\nare not met. And this is just the\nbeginning. Waste management can\nbe expected to become increasingly\nmore demanding, and conventional\ndisposal to that hole in the ground\nincreasingly costly. This will place\nan extra demand on any business\nbudget.\nThere is a burgeoning market for\nrecyclables \u2013 a ready raw material\nin a world of rapidly declining virgin\nraw materials. Some even pay for\nour unwanted materials! One used\naluminium can has a resale value\nof 0.5p, whilst the market for used\noffice quality paper is also consider-able. New markets are also opening up for plastics and glass, and\nit wouldn\u2019t be surprising if funding\nwas to become available for more\nintensive work in this field!\nOf course, recycling waste products should not be viewed solely\nfrom the legislative/economic per-spective, or as a potential resource\nof research funding. The UK has\nseen a steady increase in the amount\nof municipal waste produced annu-ally, despite disposal concerns. By\nreducing the amount we dispose in\nthe general refuse bin, preferably\nthrough minimising the waste we\nproduce or alternatively by reusing\nor recycling that which is produced,\nwe reduce resource dissipation and\ndiminish the \u2018ecological footprint\u2019\nwe leave.\nSo, where are the recycling facilities at Imperial \u2013 a centre of excellence for environmental research?\nThat\u2019s the question an increasing\nnumber of people, both staff and\nstudents, are beginning to ask. As\nan institution at the cutting edge of\na number of scientific disciplines,\nImperial would be expected to be\nthe first to adopt measures aimed at\nreducing environmental impact. Yet\nthere seems to be some reluctance\nto assume a \u2018green\u2019 attitude.\nIt would be unfair to state that\nImperial has made no attempt\nto divert waste away from land-fill. There is a white paper recycling scheme operated at South\nKensington, and the College has\nprovided glass and can collection\npoints at Beit and Southside. Some\ndepartments and buildings have\nchosen to operate their own recycling programme, usually through\na separate collection of white paper.\nCardboard is also separately collected for recycling and a battery\ncollection scheme is being devel-oped. There have also been occasional attempts in places to improve\noverall environmental performance,\nas demonstrated by the occasional energy efficiency sticker placed\nnear a light switch! However, there\nis no comprehensive College-wide\nscheme, nor does one look likely in\nthe immediate future.\nOne department, the Department\nof Environmental Sciences, is initiating a pilot scheme for the collection of recyclables such as paper,\ncans, glass, plastic, batteries, cardboard and printer toners. They are\nalso raising environmental awareness in general and are attempting to promote a culture of environmental conscientiousness. Not\nonly are they aiming to inculcate an\nideology of \u2018reduce, reuse, recycle\u2019,\nbut a goal is to encourage general\nenvironmentalism: don\u2019t leave lights\non, print on both sides of the paper,\nre-use your cup...\nSuch general awareness is also\nimportant in the context of the pilot\nrecycling scheme. For it to work,\nit requires everyone to participate\nand be aware of what can (and can-not) be disposed. For instance, a\ncoke can thrown into a plastic-only\nbin spoils a collection and leads to\nlandfill disposal of the whole load,\nas has happened with the Beit and\nSouthside bins. Using the right\nbin is crucial to any recycling\nproject. If the department\u2019s pilot\nis successful and creates enough\ninterest across the College, perhaps\nencouragement for a wider scheme\ncan be generated.\nAs a rapidly acquisitive society,\nthe UK has little time for waste\nissues. All this will have to change\ndue to environmental contamination concerns and pressure from the\nEU, a change that is well overdue.\nWouldn\u2019t it be better for Imperial\nto be at the vanguard of this waste\nrevolution rather than be left behind\nwith hefty fines and a poor record\nin corporate environmental respon-sibility?\nBring on the bins\nRebecca Slack argues that Imperial College should be at the forefront of a revolution in waste disposal\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cImperial would be expected to be the first to adopt measures aimed at reducing environmental impact...\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004 11\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004 17\nDay out in Londonfelix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Zaina Nobeebux\nAre you a night owl and struggling\nto find something to do during the\ndaytime? Are you a fresher who\nknows very little about London, trying to figure out where to explore\nnext? Or are you one of those people\nwho never get out of their rooms and\nhave suddenly decided to make the\nmost of their time in London before\nthey graduate? If you answered yes\nto any of those, this article should be\nthe perfect source of inspiration and\nideas for you!\nWell, anybody smart enough to\nread the title of an article before\nthe actual text should know by now\nthat I shall be telling you about the\nNotting Hill area. Notting Hill... the\nname of this place should strike a\nbell in the mind of almost everyone in Imperial College, not only\nbecause you\u2019ll have spotted it on the\ntube map, but also because it has\nhosted the movie with Hugh Grant\nand Julia Roberts, an absolute must\non Valentine\u2019s Day to make you all\nsoppy and romantic (maybe).\nBut let\u2019s get back to the point, or\nrather to the place, before I start\nranting about the merits and faults\nof a movie. I shall assume that all of\nyou are normal students and youngsters who never get up before, say,\n10am during the weekends. So, for\nall of you who live south of Notting\nHill, I would suggest you have lunch\nin Holland Park, and why not spend\na lazy morning in the sun (whenever\nthere is some) before going to conquer the next place.\nHolland Park has the advantage of\nhaving plentiful benches and places\nto sit (excluding grass), as opposed\nto many other parks. A walk through\nthis park comprises delightful water\nfeatures as well as a Japanese garden with a pond, its waters being\nvery dense with colourful fish making a good contrast with the dark\nbed. This leads to a little wood in\nthe middle, and finally towards the\nother end of the park. And if you\ntechies are lucky enough through\nyour meanderings in the woods, you\nmay find yourself next to the solar\ndial, then onto Holland Park Road\nleading to an electric bike shop.\nLadies, this is where we find our\nmen deeply engrossed in window\nshopping. Just a note for cyclists,\nthere is a bike track on the side of\nHolland Park with a steep slope, so\nyou can just whiz through the park\nwithout bothering with the walk.\nAfter a further five to ten minutes walk, you should find yourself\nnext to Notting Hill Gate tube sta-tion. Once there, don\u2019t panic if you\ncan\u2019t find signs leading to the legendary Portobello market. If you are\nthere on a Saturday, just follow the\nmasses of people! Otherwise, if you\njust go down Pembridge Road for a\ncouple of minutes, you should find\nyourself on Portobello Road leading\nto the market.\nBut before I proceed to the mar-ket, I would like to mention that\nthere are other things in the area\nwhich are worth looking at during\nthe daytime (excluding the common\n\u2018normal\u2019 shops which can be found\non any high street). Notting Hill is\nthe haven for shops selling anything\n\u2018ancient\u2019, including antiques, retro\nand vintage. In fact, around the tube\nstation are various retro clothes and\nbook \u2018buy, trade and sell\u2019 shops. One\nof them is called \u2018Book and Comic\nExchange\u2019. I\u2019m not a comic book fan,\nwhich explains why I never went\ninto that very old and cluttered looking bookshop with rock music blast-ing, but curiosity and the magnetism of books got the better of me in\nthe end, and I must admit that I was\npleasantly surprised by the variety of second hand books there. On\nthe shelves nearer to the door are\nclassic books ranging from Austen\u2019s\nEmma to Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace,\nwith a whole shelf labelled \u201cCharles\nDickens arse chickens\u201d especially\nreserved for Dickens\u2019s work. Other\nbookshelves contain a vast array of\nbooks labelled literature, cult, phi-losophy, psychology, art, photography and architecture. Comic books\nare found in the middle section,\ntheir prices ranging between 50p\nto \u00a34, and there is even a section\nlabelled \u201creally boring books\u201d to suit\nall tastes!\nAll along Pembridge Road are\na variety of unusual shops including an art shop, a vintage shop,\nlots of antiques shops as well as a\nshop selling bits and bobs of African\ndesign, leading to the first stalls of\nthe market. That Saturday, a salesgirl was running around trying to\nget some spidery piece of metal on\nevery passer-by\u2019s head to promote\nthat product, which at first sight\nreminded me of a torturing device.\nAfter a lot of convincing and coax-ing, coupled with the signs \u201cHead\nEcstasy and Orgasmic Experience\u201d,\nshe managed to get some guinea\npigs to experiment it. They seemed\nto like it...\nOf course, once one reaches the\nmain bit of the market, one is normally overwhelmed by the variety\nof things for sale at different stalls,\nwhich are mainly related to antiques\non this side of the market. These\ninclude antique bottles, jewellery,\npottery, clocks, silverware, cameras\nand optical instruments, dinky toys,\ncoins, as well as fine art prints,\nmetal stamps, handmade soap, laminated posters, silk scarves and CDs\nat bargain prices. The main market\nhosts smaller \u201csub-markets\u201d with\nsimilar types of stalls. One of them\nspecialises in Russian dolls, with the\nmost impressive set being made of\n29 dolls ranging from about 40cm to\n5mm in height (I counted them and\nI\u2019m not exaggerating!)\nOne of my favourite bits is an alley\nbranching from Portobello Road and\ncontaining a few stalls only. They\nsell mainly old rusty military objects\n(nothing comparable to the posh\nMichael German of Kensington\nChurch Street): hats from the\nRAF, police or Russian army, army\nboots as well as old dusty pieces\nof armoury such as metal body\narmours and swords would delight\nalmost anyone.\nThe next bit of the market is the\nfood section, which is full of fresh\nvegetables, herbs and exotic fruits,\nlike fresh dates, yam, cassava and\nwhat appeared to me to be white\npears also known as Chinese pears,\nas dutifully corrected by the fruit\nseller. Other stalls there are a spice\nstall bursting with the aroma of\nspices from the four corners of the\nworld, bread stalls for pastry lov-ers, and some sweet stalls. Also\npresent are trailers selling German\nand Thai food and hot dogs since by\nthen every student would be feeling\npeckish.\nPortobello Road is not just about\nthe market, but also the shops on\nboth sides, often hidden by the stalls,\nbut nonetheless very interesting\nand definitely worth a visit. Jessie\nWestern, as the name suggests, specialises in western clothes, jewellery and mainly cowboy hats and\nboots made of buffalo, frog, ostrich\nand even lizard leather! An antique\nsports shop sells antique brown footballs and cricket balls, golf clubs,\ntrophies, and boxing gloves. Art\nDeco is a decorative antique shop\nselling unusual arty furniture, some\npieces looking like those featured\nin movies. One of them is a sofa in\nthe shape of a boot, which I found\ncreative, and examined in awe for so\nlong that the salesman grew suspicious and looked like he wanted to\nthrow me out.\nMuslim students will be glad to\nknow that there is a halal butcher\nin one of the shops near the food\nsection, and since we are on the\ntopic of choices on food, vegetarians will find it useful to know that\nThe Grain Shop does some vegan,\nbut mainly vegetarian food like\nflapjacks, couscous, moussaka and\nbakes for take away. I\u2019m sure most\nSpaniards here know about Garcia,\nthe Spanish shop, selling, well, lots\nof Spanish food like Arborio rice,\npickled peppers and olives, tortil-las, whole hams (chorizo, picant\u00e9\nmortadella) and cheap wine. I also\ncame across a cacti and bonsai shop\nby the flyover near Ladbroke Grove.\nFor those of you who would like to\ndine out, Babes and Burgers is the\nplace to go if you like burgers, and\nThai Rice offers a main meal for\nabout \u00a35.\nIt is worth noting that the market\ndoes not stop at the flyover, but goes\non until Golborne Road which is full\nof Moroccan shops for those of you\nwho have plenty of time to spare.\nI hope that I have illuminated\nthose who have never been to the\nNotting Hill area and inspire them\nto go there once. For those of you\nwho have been there numerous\ntimes and have different views, I\u2019ll\njust say that I\u2019ve highlighted what I\nenjoyed the most there.\nNotting Hill\n\u201cArt Deco is a decorative antique shop selling unusual arty furniture...\u201d\n\u201cOne of my favourite bits is stalls selling old rusty military objects...\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004\nFILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n23\nTo be honest, I really didn\u2019t know\nwhat to expect from this film.\nObviously, it was about Christmas,\nwhich to me implied it was a children\u2019s film, not something that I\nwould generally go to watch or look\nforward to. However, I kept an open\nmind as I took my seat in the cinema\nand waited for The Polar Express to\nbegin. I was pleasantly surprised.\nThe film is set on Christmas Eve.\nIt\u2019s the night before Christmas and\na young boy is at that age where he\nis beginning to doubt whether Santa\nClaus really exists. A loud racket\nwakes him from his sleep as his bedroom begins to shake. Lights shine\nthrough his window as he realises\nsomething big is moving outside.\nCharging out the door into the cold\nand into the snow he comes face to\nface with an old steam train, The\nPolar Express. Accepting the invitation by the conductor, he climbs\naboard as they set off for the North\nPole, and for Santa. He finds he is\nnot the only one aboard as he sets\neyes on other children of similar\nages, all potentially facing their last\nyear of believing. However, the ride\nis not a smooth journey and it\u2019ll take\nmore than luck to get them out of\ntrouble. It\u2019ll take some magic!\nTom Hanks sees to the voice of\nthe conductor as well as many other\ncharacters in the film. For a brief\nmoment I thought it might be better\nto include a few other big names,\nbut really the parts are too small.\nReturning to my senses I decided\nit was a good idea to let Hanks ride\nsolo. Unsurprisingly for an actor of\nhis talent, he does a great job.\nThe Polar Express is pleasing to\nthe eye from start to finish as the\ncomputer animation is spectacular.\nBoth the characters and their surroundings look as real as I\u2019ve ever\nseen in a CGI movie. At times you\nforget that it isn\u2019t real... until you see\nelves running around, of course.\nWhilst its visual appeal is at an\nextraordinary level, it was the\namount of action in the film that\nsurprised me the most. Obviously it\ncan\u2019t compete with the latest sci-fi or\nthriller but in defence of The Polar\nExpress, it wasn\u2019t meant to be any\nof these things. It\u2019s a Christmas film,\nthe most action-packed Christmas\nfilm I have ever seen. It includes\neverything from the driver losing\ncontrol of the train to the train itself\nbeing derailed and skidding across\nan enormous glacier. Towards the\nend of the movie, the excitement\ndies down quite drastically, but the\nrest of the film more than makes\nup for it.\nOne thing that I didn\u2019t find so\namazing was the songs. Admittedly\nthey were probably good in their\nown right but they just didn\u2019t appeal\nto me and I was grateful that the\ncharacters kept their bursting into\nsong to a minimum.\nI never really considered myself\nto be a great fan of Christmas films,\nhowever The Polar Express is worth\nwatching especially since we are\ncreeping ever closer to the festive\nseason, and has certainly changed\nmy views. I found it really put me in\nmood to share the holiday spirit.\nAlthough the film has a few little\nkinks in its overall appeal, there\nis nothing that should spoil it for\nanyone. People of all ages will enjoy\nthis film if they go bearing in mind\nwhat it is they are about to watch.\nIt\u2019s about the spirit of Christmas,\nso be open minded, sit back, relax\nand enjoy.\nStephen Smith\nBrrrrrilliant\nThe Polar Express is making its way to the UK for a journey beyond your imagination, to\nmake you believe this holiday season\nThe Polar Express\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\nStarring: Tom Hanks,\nEddie Deezen, Nona Gayne\nLength: 100 minutes\nCertificate: U\nHHHHI\nReleased: 10 December\nThat must be an awfully tall mountain\n\u201cIt really put me in\nthe mood to share\nthe holiday spirit\u201d\nDawn just comes too early\nShould have been Forgotten and left in America\nI\u2019m a great lover of movies. It\u2019s\nrare that something comes along\nand taints my opinion of Hollywood.\nThis is one of those unthinkable\nmoments. The Forgotten is truly\none of the worst movies I\u2019ve seen\nin a long time. Before you read\nany further, this review contains\nplot spoilers, otherwise there is no\nway to review this movie. But that\nshouldn\u2019t matter \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t see\nthis.\nTelly Paretta (Julianne Moore)\nlost her son, along with eight other\nchildren, fourteen months ago in a\nplane crash. She can\u2019t stop griev-ing. Her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise)\nwonders if she is enhancing her\nmemories of Sam. She tries to limit\nher daily visits to photo albums and\nhome videos. Then, one horrifying\nday, she finds that all her photos\nand videos of Sam have vanished\nand been erased. She blames her\nhusband Jim (Anthony Edwards),\nbut then she gets the bad news: she\nnever had a son. She had a miscar-riage. All of her memories of Sam\nhave been fabricated in some kind of\npost-traumatic-syndrome scenario.\nThe shrink and her husband agree:\nno Sam. In desperation, she turns\nto a neighbor Ash Correll (Dominic\nWest), whose daughter also died in\nthe same crash. He tells her he never\nhad a daughter. Rather miraculously\nthough, he remembers, though everyone else still has no clue.\nThe movie then descends, quite\nfrankly, into absurdity and repeti-tiveness. Its one chase after anoth-er, where they just seem to get\naway every time, even thought the\npursuers are government agents.\nThere are also the repeated reruns\nof Telly\u2019s memories of Sam, and his\nannoying smile and wink. Even the\nmost ardent of movie-goers grows\nweary and tired.\nThe movie is disjointed, with people seemingly jumping from one conclusion to another. There\u2019s little or\nno elaboration upon how they make\nsome of the absurd conclusions that\nthey inevitably do in order to drive\na preposterous plot. \u201cThe goddamn\ntruth won\u2019t fit in your brain,\u201d yells\na desperate agent. Sadly, the \u201cgoddamn truth\u201d and plot would fit on\nthe back of a postage stamp. The\ndialogue is lazy; the script is bland\nand unintelligent, though adequately delivered.\nThere are continuity errors aplen-ty: running pedestrians over without so much as denting your car\nperhaps? The acting is laughable at\ntimes, in particular West\u2019s performance in an interrogation scene. The\nmajority of the last hour is laugh-able.\nSo why should you go see this\nmovie? Like Gigli (Ben Affleck and\nJennifer Lopez), the temptation to\ngo see a shockingly bad movie can\nbe quite hard to resist, and it can\nturn out to be quite a good laugh! Be\nwarned, however: make sure everyone knows what they\u2019re getting into,\notherwise you\u2019ll just feel guilty (like\nI did) for wasting two hours of your\nfriends\u2019 lives. Other high points of\nThe Forgotten include the trailers,\nthe popcorn and a few shocks and\nscares \u2013 including a scene where a\ncop gets pulled off the case, so to\nsay; even though highly predictable\nit still makes little girls scream.\nIn all fairness though, Julianne\nMoore does give a good perform-ance, and is convincing. And it has\nbeen a while since I saw a movie\nabout the paranormal. But ultimate-ly, I was left wondering why a creditable actress like Julianne Moore\nagreed to be cast in a terrible movie\nlike this. Perhaps the money, or even\nstranger still maybe she\u2019s a believer.\nWho knows? But more incredibly,\nwhy on earth did Revolution Studios\nbother to make this, and why did\nColumbia choose to distribute it? Do\nthey really think that there is money\nto make with such bad material?\nThat said, Columbia did manage\nto create an enticing trailer that\nconvinced some poor souls to pay\nto watch it.\nSeriously though, if you have\nfree time this week, go see I Heart\nHuckabees or The Polar Express. I\nwish I had.\nAlan Ng\nFilm Editor\nThe Forgotten\nDirector: Joseph Ruben\nStarring: Julianne Moore, Gary Sinise,\nAnthony Edwards, Linus Roache\nLength: 91 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nHIIII\nOne nice happy, amnesiac, vanishing family\n\u201cWhy on earth did\nRevolution Studios\nbother to make this?\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "This summer I rediscovered a\ncountry where convenience has not\ndriven out variety, a country where\nsameness is not the everyday norm.\nI travelled to Sri Lanka and\nentered an unfamiliar world. This\nbeautiful, intriguing and contrasting country \u2013 where the landscape\nchanges from long yellow stretches\nof beaches with turquoise sea to arid\ndry cactus deserts and mountainous regions where people dress in\nwoolly hats and jumpers \u2013 made me\nquestion the world I have become\naccustomed to.\nMy most memorable experience was visiting Kataragama,\na unique pilgrimage site in Sri\nLanka for Buddhists, Hindus and\nMuslims. Within an enclosed area,\nmosques and temples group togeth-er. Chanting, bells, drums and the\nIslamic call to prayer harmoniously\nfill the air. I found this particularly\nthought provoking with regard to\ntoday\u2019s social climate.\nSri Lanka\u2019s history is fascinat-ing, with ancient monuments to\nrival those of Machu Picchu. These\ninclude King Kasyappa\u2019s fifth century AD palace on top of a 600ft\nrock. Entering this palace would\nhave involved climbing up spiralling\nstairs carved into the rock and, at\nthe top, stepping through the mouth\nof a huge statue lion. On top, one can\nsee the huge throne where the King\nwould have sat watching his 500 concubines drinking and dancing.\nThe Sri Lankans are exceptionally friendly and always smiling.\nEveryone wanted to say \u2018hello\u2019 and\none endearing girl asked, \u2018Do you\nmind if we speak English for a while\nplease?\u2019 London Underground etiquette made me first ignore these\nquestions, but gradually I learnt the\nvirtue of conversation.\nInevitably I found myself back on\nthe plane. Now, even the adverts of\nthe in-flight magazine, where the\ncowboy rides across Marlboro country breathing in lungfuls of fresh air\nbut not cigarette smoke, seemed\nridiculous. Arriving at the airport,\nStarbucks\u2019 new campaign slogan\nencouraging consumer imagina-tion, \u2018Be creative, choose your shot\u2019,\nseemed absurd for carbon-copy coffee shops with no individuality.\nCountries all across the world\nare settling into the same. Body\nShops and Hiltons are found in large\nnumbers. Convenience has driven\nout variety. Which American mall\ndoesn\u2019t have JC Penney, Radio\nShack and Haagen Dazs? Which\nBritish high street doesn\u2019t have\nMarks and Spencer, Boots, WH\nSmith and Topshop? And when you\ncome across these shops abroad,\nyour first response is not a flash of\npleasant recognition but a dull sense\nthat you have not reached anywhere\ndifferent at all.\nThere are only a handful of places\non Earth where you can escape all\nthis completely. To the extent of my\nknowledge, there is no McDonalds\nin Cuba and no Coca-Cola in Libya.\nIn Sri Lanka, I only counted two\nMcDonalds and one KFC, all in\nColombo. At least in this country, for\nthe time being, diversity and uniqueness are still present.\nSameness afflicts our lives, sometimes without us realizing it when\nwe are absorbed in our daily rou-tines. Invariably today\u2019s craziness\nfor sameness will be transformed\ninto tomorrow\u2019s rational order,\nwhich then will become a new and\nperfectly workable basis for society.\nHopefully we will not forget the need\nfor contrast and unpredictability. If\nyou desire a fresh perspective, I\nrecommend visiting Sri Lanka to\ncelebrate and welcome difference\nand complexity.\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004 9\nSameness\n\u25cf Colin Smith is the Welfare\nCampaigns Officer of Imperial\nCollege Union. However, this\narticle consists of his own\npersonal opinions and not\nnecessarily those of Imperial\nCollege Union or of Felix\nAs reported a year ago in the 5\nDecember 2003 issue of Felix, and\nin many other newspapers, a member of Imperial College IT staff was\narrested three days earlier in a\n\u2018counter-terrorist\u2019 operation. What is\nnot known, and has not been report-ed, is what has happened since.\nThe member of staff was Babar\nAhmad. He was born and raised\nin London. After obtaining a masters degree in engineering from\nImperial, he went on to work in\nthe Mechanical Engineering depart-ment.\nAt 5.50am on 2 December, Babar,\na practising Muslim, was woken up\nby eight riot police who took him\nto Charing Cross police station.\nHis friends and supporters believe\nthat he was abused by police offic-ers. After six days of interrogation,\nBabar was released without charge\n\u2013 there was no evidence against\nhim. Photographs taken in cus-tody, as well as a more detailed\nlook at the case, can be found at\nwww.freebabarahmad.co.uk.\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there.\nBabar was rearrested on 5 August\nthis year, and is still being held in\nWoodhill Prison in Milton Keynes.\nHe has been described by newspapers as \u2018Bin Laden\u2019s right hand\nman\u2019. The allegations and evidence\nof his involvement with terrorism\nof any form amount to very little.\nOne of the main pieces of evidence\nis a tourist brochure advertising\nthe Empire State Building that was\nfound in his house. This belongs\nto his father Ashfaq Ahmad, who\nvisited the landmark in the 1970s\nand has the photographs and visa\nto prove it.\nThe evidence is in fact so flimsy\nthat he cannot be tried in Britain.\nFor this reason, he was arrested\nunder an extradition warrant from\nthe United States. New legislation,\nforced through by Home Secretary\nDavid Blunkett, means that the US\ncan demand the extradition of a\nBritish citizen without evidence and\non the basis of allegations alone. This\nis particularly worrying considering\nthat the British legal system will\nnow accept evidence given under\ntorture (providing it has not been\ncarried out by a British institution).\nAll this in spite of the US\u2019s systematic human rights abuses of prisoners\nin Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay,\nand elsewhere.\nThe case of Babar Ahmad is not\nan isolated one. Since 11 September\n2001, the number of times Muslims\nhave been stopped and searched by\npolice has risen dramatically, but\nonly a tiny percentage of the hundreds arrested under anti-terror\nlaws have actually been convicted.\nIt seems that this racist victimisa-tion and intimidation of Muslims is\nanother face of the so-called \u2018war\non terror\u2019 that is widely believed\nby people outside the current government to have actually made the\nworld more susceptible to terror-ism. In order to try to justify the\nother face of this permanent global\nwar, the massacre of 100,000 people in Iraq (as reported recently in\nthe respected medical journal The\nLancet), the Government here is\ntrying desperately to create a climate of fear where terrorists are\nconstantly in our midst.\nBut this is not an issue that affects\njust Muslims. The stop and search\nfigures for afro-carribeans have\nrisen by 200% since 11 September\n2001. And if our own Babar Ahmad\nis extradited to the US (a country\nwith the death penalty, let us not\nforget), on the grounds that the\nBritish legal system is not as fair\nor effective as the American one,\nthen it sets a very dangerous\nprecedent.\nThat is why it is vitally important that as many people from as\nmany backgrounds as possible get\ninvolved with the campaign for\nBabar\u2019s release. He was a student\nand staff member here, and many\npeople at Imperial knew him per-sonally. We all need to rally together\nto defend our civil liberties, which\nare being eroded on almost a\ndaily basis. The proposed introduction of compulsory ID cards is\nyet another aspect of this war on civil\nliberties which looks set to become a\nreality at sometime in the future. So,\nI would encourage everyone to join\nBabar\u2019s father, campaigning journalist Yvonne Ridley, and others, to\nlaunch this campaign at Imperial, in\na meeting taking place tonight:\n\u2018Stop the War of Terror, Stop the\nWar on Civil Liberties \u2013 Free Babar\nAhmad\u2019, 6.00pm, tonight (Thursday 2\nDecember), Sir Alexander Fleming\nBuilding, Lecture Theatre 1.\nToday it is Babar Ahmad.\nTomorrow it could be you.\nCOLIN SMITH\nStop the war on civil liberties\nSign up now!\nWhy not get active in the community whilst you\u2019re at Imperial\nCollege London?

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004\n6\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThis is the news: blind car\nthief arrested in Romania\nafter crashing car into tree,\nundertaker blown into grave\nby gust of wind during funer-al, half naked New Yorker\nwalks into police station and\nconfesses murder, and final-ly, lightening bolt kills 10,000\nkosher chickens.\nThis week\u2019s science section\nfeatures our first ever maths\nfeature article. Alex Antonov\nlooks at the importance of\nthe Millennium problems in\nmathematics and in particular the P = NP problem which\nhas eluded explanation for so\nlong.\nWe also report on the\nGovernment\u2019s White Paper\non public health. Tom\nSimonite looks at the ban on\nsmoking and the epidemiological evidence for the dangers of passive smoking, and\nRosie Taylor examines the\ndietary issues and what the\nGovernment is planning to do\nto make us healthier.\nThe ban on smoking is\nsomething that should be at\nthe forefront of every smoker\nand non-smoker\u2019s attention.\nWhat was once a fashionable\nhabit in the 1950s may quickly\nbecome a social faux-pas. The\nGovernment\u2019s legislation is\nessentially recognising passive smoking as a \u2018risk\u2019. This\nwill inevitably lead to further\nstigmatisation of smokers.\nWhether this is justified or not\non the basis of the evidence is\na question that, to my mind,\nremains answered.\nWe also look at organ-traf-ficking and the exploitative economy that has risen\nbecause of it. Giovanna Larice\ntakes a realistic approach to\nwhat many see as a deeply\nimmoral trade. Given the\ncapitalist values that govern the world economy at\nthe moment, why shouldn\u2019t\npoor people be allowed to sell\ntheir organs in a free mar-ket? Surely legitimising organ\nsales would put a stop to an\nillegitimate black market\ntrade that sees donors being\nexploited by the middle men\nand rich purchasers? These\nare some of the questions\naddressed in the article.\nLast year I interviewed\nOlivia Judson, whose book Dr.\nTatiana\u2019s Sex Advice To All\nCreation was reviewed. This\nweek, Sonja van Renssen\ntakes an interesting look at\nthe major theme of this book\nwhich is the evolutionary biology of sex \u2013 perhaps a taboo\nsubject for the more conservatively inclined, but certainly\na legitimate field for scientific\nstudy.\nFinally we have a review\nof the Annual Pfizer Lecture\nwhich asks the question: what\nis it to be human? Andya\nPrimanda\u2019s review takes\na look at what separates us\nfrom the ape world and our\nown genetic diversity.\nSo what is it to be human?\nThe Pfizer Annual lecture at the Natural History Museum raised the questions. Andya Primanda\nreports on our genetic links with the ape world and our own genetic diversity\nWhat makes us human?\nDr Armand Marie Leroi\nopened the first part of this\nyear\u2019s Pfizer Annual Science\nLecture 95% Chimp \u2013 The\nGenes that make us Human\nby reflecting on a 1860s\ndebate over that question\nbetween two scientific giants\nof their time: Thomas Henry\nHuxley and Richard Owen.\nEarlier scholars like Galen\nand Linnaeus had acknowledged that apes closely\nresemble humans, and\nDarwin\u2019s theory implied a\ncommon descent between\nhumans and apes.\nIn the nineteenth century,\nRichard Owen, who wanted to\nprotect man\u2019s special status\nin nature, sought to find the\nkey difference that separates\nhumans from animals, and he\nclaimed that the hippocampus minor, a small fold at the\nback of the brain, is only possessed by humans. Huxley\nargued that any difference\nbetween humans and animals\nwere just a matter of degree,\nand there was nothing special\nseparating humans from ani-mals. However, Huxley later\nconclusively demonstrated\nthat the hippocampus minor\nis also present in ape brains.\nThis demonstration marks\nHuxley\u2019s victory over Owen.\nMore than 100 years later,\nafter subsequent developments which included the\nbirth of genetics, the synthesis of evolution and genetics\nand the discovery of DNA, the\nquestion of what makes us\nhuman re-emerged. The first\nDNA hybridization studies\nfound a 99% match between\nhuman and chimpanzee DNA,\nand later research tended to\nreinforce this conclusion by\nachieving roughly the same\nresults (95% to 99% simi-larity). By 2003, the human\ngenome had been completely\nmapped, and the first draft of\nthe chimpanzee genome had\nbeen finished. This data is to\nprovide new ways to answer\nour question, to find out what\nare the differences that made\nus human. How do we find\nwhich differences are impor-tant? Dr Leroi suggested, by\nstudying mutants.\nLeroi cited the case of\nthe \u2018Chuas\u2019. The Chuas are\na group of beggars in Shah\nDaulah, Pakistan. They have\nsmall heads and are mentally\nretarded, a condition known\nas \u2018microcephaly\u2019. Carl Vogt,\nan earlier student of human\nvariations, studied micro-cephaly because he thought\nit would give him clues to\nthe evolution of humans. It is\nnow known that microcepha-ly is caused by a genetic dis-order, a deleterious recessive\nmutation at the gene ASPM.\nASPM is now known to be\ninvolved in brain growth, and\nfurther studies show that it\nunderwent some major evolutionary changes during the\ncourse of human evolution.\nASPM is only the first\nknown genetic difference\nbetween humans and apes.\nAnother gene, FOXP2, was\ndiscovered to be associated\nwith language ability. Dr\nLeroi predicts that we will\nfind more of those differences as we do more comparisons across the human and\nchimp genome. These genes\nare part of what makes us\nhuman.\nIn the second part of the\ntalk, Dr Leroi addressed the\ngenetic diversity among living humans. Back at the time\nof Owen, Huxley and Darwin,\nracism was a general belief.\nPeople thought that there are\ninferior and superior races.\nBut now, thankfully, such\nbelief has been largely aban-doned. This change in our\nviews might be prompted by\nthe Holocaust and the World\nWars, in which racist ideologies caused horrible disasters to humanity.\nAfter the advent of genet-ics, scientists started to study\ngenetic variation among\nhumans. First it was discovered that, at the genetic level,\nraces don\u2019t exist. However,\nthis conclusion is somehow\nhard to grasp, because it\nruns counter to people\u2019s daily\nexperiences.\nThere is a paradox in modern genetics. We now know\nso much about DNA and the\ngenes but the simple questions remain unanswered.\nAsk a geneticist, \u201cWhy do\npeople have brown or blue\neyes?\u201d The answer might be,\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the genes.\u201d But if you\npush for the details, asking\nwhat genes are responsible\nand how they do it, it\u2019s possible that our geneticist would\nnot know the answer.\nHowever, there have been\nstudies on the genes responsible for visible differences. At\nleast one gene, MC1R, which\ninfluences skin/hair pigmen-tation, has a variation that\ncorresponds to geographical\npopulations, or, races. This\nshows that, at least from\nMC1R\u2019s point of view, human\nraces do exist. Supporting\nevidence also comes from\nthe discovery that different\nhuman ethnicities have different genetic disorder frequencies and genetic predisposition towards certain dis-eases, for instance, sickle cell\nanemia among Africans and\ncystic fibrosis among northern Europeans.\nThe study of racial variation\nisacontroversialtopic.Critics\nhave already warned that the\nstudy of \u2018racial science\u2019 might\nend up misused by racists.\nHowever, certain differences\nbetween races are real, and\nwe need to understand them\nif we are to implement social\njustice. Why do we need to\nknow what makes people dif-ferent? Apart form the obvious practical purposes, Dr\nLeroi pointed out another\nreason. There are people at\nthe Natural History Museum\nand Imperial College studying the diversity of birds,\nflowers, parasitic wasps, and\nmany others. If the diversity\nof these creatures are considered significant enough to\njustify research, then surely\nhuman diversity deserves\nmore attention. And, he concluded the lecture, diversity\nitself is beautiful and admira-ble, something that is worth\npreserving and studying.\nSome questions from the\naudience were concerned\nabout the use of the results\nof human diversity studies.\nOne raised the possibility\nof discrimination based on\ngenetic profiles. Another\nasked whether the information would lead to \u2018designer\nbabies\u2019, parents choosing\ncertain features for their\nunborn children. A geneticist\ncommented that the human\ngenetic diversity data is valuable for the purpose of tailoring drugs to meet the needs of\nvarious genetic backgrounds.\nThis practice is not racist,\nshe said, but the opposite is.\nUsing drugs tested on a certain ethnic group on another\nwith a different genetic profile would be dangerous and\nirresponsible.\nThe audience\u2019s concern\nseemed to converge on one\ntheme \u2013 issues of ethics. The\npublic asked the scientist,\n\u201cWhat should we do with all\nthis data of human genetics?\u201d Genetics has become\nthe 21st century Pandora\u2019s\nBox, just as nuclear physics\nwas the 20th century\u2019s. We\nhave discovered a lot, but we\nare still hesitant about this\nnew knowledge. Would it be\na great benefit or disaster to\nhumanity?\nDr Leroi replied that scientists are not always capable to resolve ethical issues.\nThis dialogue would require a\ngreater public understanding\nof science and the involvement of those competent in\nanswering ethical questions\n\u2013 philosophers, theologians,\nlawmakers. And while the\nscientist\u2019s job is primarily to\nfind what is, I believe it is\nalso the scientists\u2019 responsibility to keep the public informed of their work.\nIgnorance is no help, and the\nknowledge must be shared\nwith everyone.\nYOUR SCIENCE VIEWS\ntell Felix Science what you think\nLast week\u2019s article on animal testing provides some useful\ninformation but, as usual, sees the issue from a myopic human\nperspective. Animal testing and factory farming are just examples\nof our arrogance as human beings...\n(for the rest of this response, see Comment, page 10)\nVeer Singh, Physics\nFirstly, it will always be hard to understand what an animal \u2018thinks\u2019 or\n\u2018feels\u2019. If it was possible to fully understand what an animal feels and\nthinks then this discussion would probably end pretty quickly. Second,\ndevelopments to reduce animal testing are underway and new\nprocedures are in place to minimise the use of animals. But to test the\nproducts on humans will obviously lead to many further questions, such\nas who and how? Consider this: testing on humans usually requires\nhigher costs (through payments and procedures). Already drugs are very\nexpensive, and this could increase this even further.\nFeature writer: Emma Williams, Biochemistry\nAny opinions about science?

In fact, this week, it was\nReading who were vulnerable\nfrom the start, as Imperial\nwent one-nil up within the\nfirst 20 minutes with a pace-setting shot from Yoda, which\nbecame her first goal in three\nyears.\nA hardworking Imperial\nside then continued to press,\nhitting Reading at pace and\nleaving them 3-0 down at half\ntime with more goals from\nEmbryo and a cracking short\ncorner from Flush. A quick\nbut effective team talk \u2013 goal\npie \u2013 and the onslaught con-tinued...\nThe goal posts certainly\nweren\u2019t eluding us this week,\nas some neat passing play\nin midfield and defence paid\ndividends for the Imperial\nattack. Our right midfielder,\nTandem, had a particularly\nsolid match, earning her the\n\u2018player of the match\u2019 accol-lade.\nAgain, dominating the play\nfor the second half, Imperial\nsaw more and more of their\nchances converted. Embryo\nused her youthful pace to glide\npast nearly every Reading\nplayer in one go, taking the\nball from defence to attack\nin a sweet run, which was\nslotted away with exquisite\nstyle. An indignant Reading\nmanaged a scrappy consolation goal on the break, as our\ndefence were thinking about\nwhich of them was going to\nscore next instead of paying\nattention to Reading\u2019s threat.\nImperial bounced straight\nback and almost immediately made it 5-1 and then\n6-1 with classy scores from\nAnticlimax and this season\u2019s\ntop scorer so far, our very own\nDJ (F)lush.\nSo the warm-up certainly is\nover. An elated Imperial team\nleft the pitch contemplating\nfuturevictories,whiledejected\nReading skulked home. A fantastic team performance, with\na touch of class from every\nplayer throughout. Bring on\nSt Mary\u2019s next week!\nHOCKEY\nHockey ladies eat goal pie again\nBuckinghamshire\nChilterns Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nHaving lost narrowly to a fluky\nlong range hoof against Bucks\nin the home BUSA fixture,\nthe mighty Thirds travelled to\nsunny Buckinghamshire for\nthe return match.\nWith only a few changes\nafter the Holloway game,\nbringing in country yokel\nTim in at left back and Jan\nreturning on the right, the\nThirds left in plenty of time\nto get to High Wycombe in\nthe big blue fun bus, narrowly\navoiding ploughing into the\nback of a car on the motorway\nbecause \u201cShatters\u2019 foot got\nstuck under the brake\u201d.\nWe arrived in the armpit\nof Britain to find that the\npitch was as lumpy as a sack\nof potatoes and the referee\nseemed to have forgotten his\npacemaker. Still, we kicked\noff believing we could get a\ndecent result, with a lot of\nthe play in the centre of the\npitch.\nAttempts on goal seemed\nto be few and far between\nfor the Thirds, restricted to\nlong range efforts from Tim\nand John Slavin. At the other\nend, the back four were proving resilient in denying the\ncountry bumpkins any decent\nchances from the numerous corners they won. After\nsome concerted pressure in\nmidfield, however, the Thirds\nmanaged to carve a chance\nfor John Scott following a\nthrough ball by Slavin. Scott\nfinished with his usual skeffy\naplomb and pea-rolled the\nball into the corner of the net\npast the \u2018keeper. Get in!\nBucks came back at us\npretty hard, with some strong\nchallenges flying in from all\ndirections. Leon was \u201ckindly\nhelped up\u201d after one challenge by a Bucks player who\nthought that dragging him\nalong the ground for a couple\nof metres by his shirt was\ndoing him a favour. Eventually\nthe pressure started to tell,\nand a mix-up between James\nHaugh and Caruso resulted\nin one of their strikers hooking the ball goalbound. Only a\nlast second clearance off the\nline by Tim stopped Bucks\ngetting their equaliser.\nUnfortunately for us, they\nsucceeded a few minutes\nlater. Another corner, this\ntime cleared perfectly by the\ndefence, resulted in the referee having a moment of madness and blowing a whistle\nfor a foul on a striker. When\nasked who committed the\noffence, he pointed off in an\nindiscriminate direction at\nnobody in particular, no doubt\nabsent-mindedly dreaming of\nthe days when he was young\nand would play football in\nthe park with the other boys,\njumpers for goalposts and\noranges at half time. Their\nstriker buried the spot-kick to\nmake it one-all. It stayed the\nsame way until the half time\nwhistle.\nAfter half time, Bucks again\ncame out strong. Having a\ncombined IQ that could have\npassed as a Tiger Woods\ngolf score, they thought that\ngood football meant hoofing\nit to their striker and then\nkicking whoever got in their\nway. Plenty of rash tackles\nresulted in some fiery banter\nall around, with their central\nmidfielder, now confirmed to\nbe the Missing Link in human\nevolution, particularly vicious.\nStill, resolute defending, good\nluck and the commitment\nnever to give up meant that\nwe kept out any chances they\nhad.\nUnfortunately we were unable to create any clear cut\nchances and steal a victory\nat the end, in no large part\ndue to their linesman\u2019s insistence on flagging anything\nthat might look like a potential chance offside. After the\ngame, it was off to the Tesco\ncaf\u00e9 for a quick slap up meal\nand then back on the funbus\nfor a suicidal drive back into\nLondon and some free pints\nat the Union.\nFOOTBALL\nMystery penalty costs Thirds points\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 3\nLuton Men\u2019s 4th 1\nBy Ian Robinson\nTeam Big Kick were in buoyant mood at Harlington ahead\nof their BUSA clash with\nLuton Fourths, boosted by\nthe return of their favourite\nidiot to form the dolphin-like\nring of steel at the back.\nWith the loss of Has in centre midfield and the fact that\nLuton had lost every single\ngame this season, captain\nShatters felt it was time to\nshuffle the pack and bring in\nClement for his first taste of\nthird team sexy football.\nThe game began with\nImperial on the back foot\nafter a series of attacks from\nLuton. After a while, Imperial\nbegan to press forward with\nsome real purpose, providing\nPerry with a couple of half\nchances which Luton were\nlucky to keep out. Despite\nconstant moaning at the ref\nfrom a few Luton players,\nthe inevitable soon occurred\nwhen Imperial took the lead.\nThis came via a penalty from\nthe trusty boot of Hideki after\na foul on new boy Clement in\nthe box.\nThe tight Imperial defence\nheld out until half time to\nreceive a few words of encouragement from Shatters. The\nsecond half began much like\nthe first had finished, with\nLuton trying their best to\nhold out against the attacking might of Imperial Thirds.\nAfter Hideki had put their\nright back on his arse for\nabout the 33rd time with some\nmazy dribbling, he responded\nby hacking down the tricky\nwinger on the edge of the box.\nHideki stepped up himself to\nfloat in a sublime ball to the\nsix yard line where it was met\nby the salmon-like dolphin\nhead of centre back Caruso,\nwho had stolen in at the back\npost to nod home his second\ngoal of the season.\nBy now, Imperial were having such dominance of the\ngame that Adam felt it was\nonly right to give Luton a\nchance to get back into it.\nReceiving the ball in the centre of the park, he turned to\nplay their midfielder in and\nleave the dolphins at the back\nin a three on two situation.\nSome unusually poor tackling\nthen led to two men charging on Shatters, and unfortunately he hacked down the\none without the ball leaving\ntheir striker to slot the ball\npast Imperial \u2018keeper James.\nThis brought Luton back into\nthe game with the score at\n2-1.\nUnfortunately for Luton,\nhowever, they still hadn\u2019t figured out how to make tackles\nat the back and proceeded to\ngive away another free-kick\naway in a dangerous area.\nThis led to Caruso charging\ninto the penalty area and\nyet again turning into a pink\nsalmon. Despite cries from\nthe Luton captain of \u201cWe\nknow where this is going\u201d,\nthey clearly didn\u2019t because\nyet again the salmon rose\nat the back post to glance\nhome another fine free kick\nfrom the boot of Hideki. The\nmighty Imperial had regained\ntheir two-goal lead, but all\nthe scorer had to show for it\nthis time was a big kiss from\ncaptain Shatters.\nAs Luton\u2019s frustration grew\nthe game descended into a\ndirty affair with Anthony very\nlucky to stay on the pitch for\na two-footed lunge. The game\nwas all but over when sub\nJohn Slavin had a goal disput-ably ruled out for offside.\nAll round, it had been a fine\nperformance from the mighty\nThirds as they kept the pressure on at the top of their\nBUSA group.\nFOOTBALL\nWhinging Luton get\nbeating they deserve WEDNESDAY\n24 NOVEMBER\nBADMINTON\nReading Women\u2019s 1st 4\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 4\nBASKETBALL\nLondon Met Men\u2019s 2nd 72\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 53\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 20\nLondon Met Women\u2019s 1st 54\nFOOTBALL\nCanterbury Christ Church\nMen\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 0\nBuckinghamshire\nChilterns Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 3\nLuton Men\u2019s 4th 1\nUCL Men\u2019s 5th 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 1\nSt Bart\u2019s & Royal London\nMen\u2019s 2nd 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 2\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 5th 0\nSchool of Pharmacy Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 0\nHOCKEY\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 7\nGKT Men\u2019s 1st 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 0\nLSE Men\u2019s 2nd 10\nSt Mary\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st 4\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 0\nLACROSSE\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 13\nBrighton Women\u2019s 1st 7\nNETBALL\nImperial Women\u2019s 2nd 39\nSt George\u2019s Women\u2019s 3rd 17\nRUGBY\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 21\nGKT Men\u2019s 1st 12\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nSt Mary\u2019s Men\u2019s 2nd 52\nSt Bart\u2019s & Royal London\nMen\u2019s 2nd 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 77\nSQUASH\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nReading Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 1st 3\nTENNIS\nKent Men\u2019s 1st 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 8\nSATURDAY\n27 NOVEMBER\nFOOTBALL\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men's 1st 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nRoyal Free Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nRoyal Vet College Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 0\nUCL Men\u2019s 6th 4\nSUNDAY\n28 NOVEMBER\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 1\nLSE Women\u2019s 1st 6\nLACROSSE\nKing\u2019s Mixed 1st 15\nImperial Mixed 1st 4\nResults\n\n"

In\nthe decades to come, Asia\nwill lurch from one climate\nextreme to another, with\nimpoverished farmers battling droughts, floods, disease,\nfood shortages and rising sea\nlevels, unless there is a global\neffort to rein in greenhouse\ngas emissions.\nBy Sonja van Renssen\nScience communication\nUnfortunately there is something called antagonistic co-evolution. This means that\nas we females are developing\nincreasingly sophisticated\nmeans of avoiding the constraints of a relationship, our\nmales are evolving state of\nthe art devices to prevent our\ndoing so.\nSadly, it\u2019s in every male\u2019s\ninterest to constrain promiscuity to increase the chances\nof his, rather than someone\nelse\u2019s, sperm fertilising an\negg.\nAs a female, there are several manipulation techniques\nto be aware of, which may\nbe broadly grouped into the\nbehavioural and the physical.\nThe former are the more subtle and can at times be very\ndifficult to identify for what\nthey are.\nA good example is the gift.\nA virgin green-veined white\nbutterfly will present his first\nfemale with a food gift that\nmay be as much as 23% of his\nwhole body weight. The lucky\n(or not so lucky) recipient is\nmuch less likely to re-mate\nthan one who has received a\nsmaller gift.\nThere are two messages\nhere: be wary of gifts and\navoid virgins.\nAnother example is atten-tiveness. In some insects,\ncontinuous antennae tickling\nis used to keep the female\npermanently locked into a\nparticular relationship. In the\nworld of birds, a male tit will\nbe prepared to have sex at\nany time, in any place, to prevent promiscuity.\nAgain, there is an important message here: don\u2019t be\nfooled by what appears to\nmeet demand; there is always\nsomething bigger and better\nout there.\nWhile these are all relatively subtle manipulations,\nit is crucial to realise that\nsome males may resort to\nbrusquer, physical methods\nof control if their sperm is\nthreatened.\nPerhaps the most common\nploy in this category is the\nplug. This can be a serious\nimpediment: a scalpel will\nbounce off the plug inserted\ninto the female cavity by a\nhouse mouse after sex. The\nmale honeybee, should he\nbeat 25,000 compatriots to the\nQueen, will actually explode\nafter sex, leaving his genitalia\nfirmly embedded in the royal\nflesh.\nEven this apparently insurmountable obstacle can be\novercome however, and, iron-ically, the solution is supplied\nby the very males who are\ntrying so desperately to protect their sperm.\nEvolution has helpfully\nled to the development of a\nwonderful variety of penises\nwhich can be extremely adept\nat erasing any traces of a\npredecessor in the female\ncavity.\nAn excellent example is\nthe black-winged damselfly\npenis, which is almost exactly\nlike a toilet brush in form and\nfunction, efficiently cleaning\nout the female cavity prior to\npenetration. Or take the rat\u2019s\nprehensile penis, which operates through suction.\nThe message here is obvi-ous: don\u2019t underestimate the\ningenuity of a potential lover;\nuse it to your advantage.\nThere are other physical\nmeans by which males try\nto give their sperm an edge\nin any particular female, but\nsince many of these do not\ndirectly impede promiscuity\nthey are of little interest to\nus here. One example is the\nattempt to dominate through\nvolume: dung fly experiments\nhave revealed that a decrease\nin monogamy can be coupled\nwith an increase in sperm\nproduction.\nWhile this is all very exciting news for the male, we can\nafford to ignore it as long as\nit does not affect a female\u2019s\ndesire to copulate.\nIn conclusion, antagonistic co-evolution is not as bad\nas it seems: the increasingly\ndevious methods of manipulation by males will always\nmeet their match in females\nthrough co-evolution.\nThe potential benefits of\nfemale promiscuity will continue to be a driving force for\nits existence and indeed it is\ndifficult to envisage a scenario in which promiscuity would\nbe significantly curbed.\nFor those males who place\ntheir hope in the restraining\npower of society, take heed\nthat the rampant yet stable\nsocieties of chimpanzees and\nbonobos that negate the idea\nthat a functioning society\nsomehow requires monoga-my.\nPerhaps at the end of the\nday, it is time for males to\naccept the fact that has been\nstaring them in the face for so\nlong now: it is us females who\nare really calling the shots\nand, yes, we like to have a bit\nof fun.\nThe evolution of female promiscuity\nBy Giovanna Larice\nBiochemistry department\nA young Moldavian engineer\nis lured to Istanbul on the\npromise of work. On his arrival he finds the promise unful-filled, the job dissolves and it\nis suggested to him to sell his\nblood in order to pay for his\nreturn fare home. Accepting,\nhe finds himself awakening\nfrom the anaesthetic with a\ndeep scar on his left side only\nto find that one of his kidneys\nis missing. He is offered $3000\nfor his loss (the going rate for\na kidney in Moldavia) and told\nto either accept or to sort his\nproblem out otherwise. This\nis a chilling and gruesome\nurban myth-like story reported by the BBC correspondent\nSue Lloyd-Roberts in Turkey.\nThere are many such\ngrisly stories circulating on\nthe streets worldwide, on\nthe internet, in the shanty-towns, tent cities and squatter\ncamps of the third world. The\nstories of kidnapping, mutilation and organ selling are a\nmixture of metaphor and fact,\nand are told and remembered\nbecause people feel that there\nis \u201csomething going on\u201d.\nThe sale of human organs\nis currently illegal in most\ncountries, including the UK,\nand is considered by many\nto be repugnant and morally\noutrageous. Critics claim that\nmaking the practice illegal\nmerely moves it underground.\nIn many countries such as\nIndia, Israel, China, Turkey,\nIraq and Russia, organ traffic takes place regularly and\nwithout too much attempt at\nsecrecy.\nInvestigations by the BBC\ninto the trade of human\norgans in India in 2002 showed\nthat an Indian city in Madras\nhad been nicknamed \u2018kidney\ncity\u2019 as most of its inhabitants\nhad sold this organ for cash.\nIn these cases, unsurpris-ingly, socially and financially\ndisadvantaged individuals are\nthe ones being exploited; the\nbuyers are stereotypically foreign and wealthy and most of\nthe money goes to the middle\nmen.\nNonetheless, perhaps it is\ntime to accept the fact that all\nin this world is now seen as\na commodity, including body\nparts, and that the decision to\nsell one\u2019s kidney, eye, portion\nof the liver or other is an undeniable personal privilege.\nDonating organs to friends\nor family members, perhaps\neven strangers in need, would\nbe thought by many as something incredibly altruistic and\nnoble, yet accepting money\nfor the same renders the exercise intolerable. People who\nunderstand this and see it as\na problem perhaps fail to see\nthe bigger picture. Most of the\norgans that come from living\ndonors come from the poor\nto the rich, from the less powerful to the more powerful,\nfrom the south to the north,\nfrom the black and brown to\nthe white and from women to\nmen. The poor undergo what\nare generally illegal, unhy-gienic, \u2018dodgy\u2019 operations\nto remove and sell precious\norgans in order to get out of\ndebt or to support their fami-lies, yet the money they get\nfor this trade is minimal and\ntheir families soon encounter\nthe same dreadful financial\ndifficulties.\nFurthermore, in a hypothetical world where selling and not donation is the\nkeyword, the poor and the\ndisadvantaged will never be\nin a position to afford these\nprized organs and will always\nremain on the donor side of\nthe exchange.\nOn the other hand, as Lloyd\nCohen (a law professor at\nGeorge Mason University\nin Virginia) suggests, one\ncould argue that most of the\nvital things in our lives (like\nfood, housing, clothes, etc)\nare bought and not donated.\nWhy can\u2019t the same apply to\norgans? We live in a dog-eat-dog world where power and\nmoney carries a lot of weight,\nlike it or not.\nAccording to the American\nauthor and newspaper man\nHenry Louise Mencken, \u201cfor\nevery complex problem there\nis a solution that is simple,\nneat and wrong\u201d. Maybe we\nhave got it wrong and we need\nto remove the ban on organ\nselling (thus hopefully avoiding a black market system)\nand attempt to make these\ntransplants less exploitative\nof poor donors, less expensive\nfor the rich recipients, and\nsafer for all.\nA survey conducted at\nImperial College on whether\npeople should be allowed to\nsell their organs showed that\n40% of students thought this\nshould be the case whilst the\nremainder did not. The public\nseems to be undecided, but\nwhat\u2019s is clear to me is that\nthe issues of legal and illegal\norgan trading are linked and\nthe former needs to be read-dressed in order for the latter\nto change.\nOrgans for sale: the wages of the poor\n\u201cPerhaps it is time to\naccept the fact that\nall in this world is now\nseen as commodity,\nincluding body parts...\u201d\nBeggar\u2019s belief: poor people throughout the world are being forced to sell their organs\nDetail from Edward Hopper\u2019s Summer Evening\n\u201c...it\u2019s in every male\u2019s\ninterest to constrain\npromiscuity to increase\nthe chance of his,\nrather than someone\nelse\u2019s, sperm fertilising\nan egg\u201d\n\n"

In fact, we arrived\nin plenty of time for dinner\nat a rather fine pub/restau-rant, the name of which I\ncan\u2019t remember. We dined on\npheasant, oxtail and all manner of tasty things. Alex even\nhad time to pop home and say\nhi to his folks.\nFeeling nicely nourished,\nwe set off to find the camp\nsite, a task that proved too\nchallenging for the combined\nefforts of the thirteen youthful pairs of eyes in the mini-bus. We twice drove past a\nrather large sign, with the\nword \u2018CAMPING\u2019 clearly\nemblazoned on it, and only\nmanaged to find it after parking almost directly in front of\nit and telephoning the owner,\nwho helpfully came outside\nand waved at us.\nAfter that excellent demonstration of our navigational\nskills, we pitched our tents\nand admired the wonderful\nview of the stars.\nOn Saturday we awoke to\nfind frost on our tents. Well,\nI say \u2018awoke\u2019 \u2013 that implies\nthat some amount of sleeping was done... That oh-so-wonderful view of the stars,\ndue to the total lack of cloud\ncover, meant that the night\nwas rather chilly.\nWe ate breakfast under a\nclearsky,anxioustosetoffand\nwarm our cold feet. Walking\nstraight from the camp site,\nwe made good progress\nthanks to good paths and\nthe almost total lack of hills.\nThe New Forest seemed to\nbe teeming with life: we saw\nfree roaming horses, ponies,\nhorses with riders, pigs, deer,\ndonkeys, dogs, pheasants and\ngrouse.\nWe arrived back quite early,\nallowing for plenty of time to\nsit in the pub before dinner.\nThis time we opted out of the\nposh food, discovering that\nthe bar menu was half the\nprice for bigger portions.\nWe all slept much better on\nSaturday night. Prepared for\nthe cold, we all wrapped up\nwarm with plenty of layers of clothing. Next morn-ing, Oliver\u2019s fantastic penknife thermometer read two\ndegrees celsius.\nSetting off, we encountered an impressively wobbly bridge, a very unimpressive castle (it was just a lump\nof earth), and more horses.\nThere was a brief moment of\nexcitement when we thought\nwe\u2019d lost Joana and Evelyne.\nThe remains of a Roman villa\nturned out to be quite a disap-pointment. It was closed, and\nseemed to consist of nothing\nmore than a couple of tarpaulins draped across the ruins.\nWe arrived back in time for\neveryone to have dinner at\ntheir own homes before getting some much-needed sleep\nin more civilised temperatures than those encountered\nover the weekend.\nTrees, horses and tents\nImperial Fellwanderers explore the New Forest\nBy Victoria Pollock\nWould you describe yourself\nas a tolerant person? Or do\nyou have a limit to your toler-ance? Do you, for example,\ntolerate the policies of George\nW Bush? What about Islamic\nterrorism? Or people with\nstrong moral convictions?\nWould you go so far as to say\nthat you even tolerate intoler-ance? Surely this is a paradox\n\u2013 we can\u2019t be intolerant of\nintolerance? Or can we?\nThe idea of \u201ctolerance\u201d\nhas several meanings in the\nEnglish language, but the\ndefinition I would like to consider is this: tolerance is \u201cthe\ncapacity for or the practice\nof recognising or respecting\nthe beliefs or practices of others\u201d. Conversely, in Webster\u2019s\nRevised Unabridged\nDictionary, intolerance is\n\u201crefusal to allow to others the\nenjoyment of their opinions,\nchosen modes of worship,\nand the like\u201d.\nIt strikes me that, by the\nvery meaning of the word,\nwe can\u2019t \u2018tolerate\u2019 anyone\nunless we disagree with\nthem to begin with. We like\nand respect those who share\nour opinions and beliefs\n\u2013 there\u2019s nothing to put up\nwith. Disagreement is in fact\nessential to tolerance.\nThis creates an interesting\nparadox. Our society tolerates\nmost behaviour today, but not\ndiffering beliefs about those\nbehaviours. If I disagree with\nsomeone or something, I am\naccused of being intolerant\n\u2013 yet this is what I need to do\nin order to exercise tolerance\nin the first instance.\nMuch of the demand for\ntolerance today is driven\nby the fact that society at\nlarge believes nothing and\nis uncomfortable with those\nwho have strong convictions.\nAs such, people often confuse\nintolerance with confident\nbelief in an absolute truth.\nIn fact, it is strong convictions and principles applying\nto humanity as a whole that\nsociety finds uncomfortable.\nIt is towards these beliefs,\nand those who hold them,\nthat our all-tolerant society is\nmost intolerant.\nMany people see intolerance as synonymous with\njudging others. The tolerant\nperson today is completely\nimpartial: no judgments are\nallowed. In post-modernism,\nwhere there is no absolute\ntruth, each person takes a\nneutral position on the convictions of others. Yet taking\nthis to extremes means that\neveryone else is expected to\nhold the same neutral ground\nand no-one can take a stance\nthat says others are wrong\nin any way. Therefore, trying\nto encompass such a wide\narray of ideas actually results\nin intolerance of anything\nthat is different! Political philosopher Michael Oakeshott\nsummed this up when he said\nthat we were a very tolerant people until we started to\npursue tolerance as a definite\nobjective.\nOne obvious example of this\nwas when the French secular tradition was confirmed\nby legislation which banned,\nin the words of President\nJacques Chirac, any \u201costentatious signs of religious\nproselytism, whatever the\nreligion\u201d. This led to anger\nfrom, among many others,\nleaders of the Muslim, Jewish\nand Christian faiths.\nEven Christmas must now\nbe \u2018tolerant-friendly\u2019. It was\nreported recently that the\nEden Project in Cornwall had\nbanned the word \u2018Christmas\u2019\n\u2013 somewhat ironically for\nsomething that takes its\nname from the biblical\naccount of creation. Although\ntheir marketing manager\nhas responded saying, \u201cEden\nloves Christmas\u201d, their \u2018Time\nof Gifts\u2019 is designed to recognise all mid-winter festivals\nand be tolerant of everyone.\nHowever, in trying not to\noffend anyone, they in fact\noffend many Christians of this\ncountry, for whom Christmas\nis a very precious and special\noccasion. It is amazing \u2013 and\nfor Christians, very sad \u2013 how\nunpopular the name of Jesus\nChrist has become.\nAlthough we have no record\nof the actual date of His birth,\nmany Christians around the\nworld observe December 25\nin honour of the birth of Jesus.\nVarious traditions and images\nassociated with Christmas,\nsuch as food, songs, gifts,\nstars and angels, originate\nfrom the earliest celebration\nof this event. Of course, the\nreal issue is not the festival itself \u2013 Christianity is not\nabout festivals \u2013 most people\ncan easily tolerate Christmas\nas an event. Rather, it is the\nChristian belief in the significance of Jesus, which we as\nChristians keep at the front of\nour minds, that people cannot\ntolerate.\nChristmas is the traditional time for us to remember\na belief that affects every-one, and we celebrate it with\nparticular and active intensity at this time. This belief\nis that that Jesus was God\u2019s\nsupreme gift to the world.\nThe world had been waiting\nfor the promised Messiah \u2013 its\nSaviour and King. Christians\nbelieve that Jesus was that\nperson. He has come and is\nthe unique Son of God.\nSo, would you be tolerant towards Jesus? If you\nwant to know more about\nJesus\u2019 exclusive claims and\nworldwide rescue, there is\na fantastic opportunity for\nyou to do so on Thursday 9\nDecember. This is the date of\nour Carol Service. It is held\nin the Main Dining Hall of\nthe Sherfield Building and\nwill start at 6.30pm. It is a\nwonderful time and everyone\nis welcome.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004\n4\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cWho of us would not be glad\nto lift the veil behind which\nthe future lies hidden; to cast\na glance at the next advances of our science and at the\nsecrets of its development\nduring future centuries?\u201d\nThus David Hilbert opened\nhis address to the second\nInternational Congress of\nMathematicians in Paris\non 8 August 1900, before\nannouncing his seminal list\nof 23 problems. Much of the\nmathematical research in the\n20th century has been influenced by this list of unsolved\nproblems, as both successful\nand unsuccessful attempts\nat solutions have yielded a\nnumber of important discoveries on the way.\nTo commemorate the occasion and provide a suitable\nlaunch for mathematics into\na new century and a new mil-lennium, one hundred years\nlater, the newly-formed Clay\nMathematics Institute (CMI)\nof Cambridge, MA, devised\nits own list of old nuts that\nhave yet to be cracked and\nformally announced it at the\nColl\u00e8ge de France in Paris\non 24 May 2000 in a lecture\nentitled \u201cThe Importance of\nMathematics\u201d. While to some\nthe latter might sound like\nan obvious oxymoron, there\nare some circumstances surrounding this list of problems\nwhich indicate that this is not\njust mathematics for mathematics\u2019 sake.\nFor one, the founder and\nsponsor of the CMI is not\nhimself a mathematician, nor\ndid he read maths at uni-versity. Landon T Clay is a\nBoston businessman who\nbelieves maths research is\nunderfunded and would like\nto see a wider dissemination\nof mathematical knowledge.\nThen, there is also the attractive price tag of $1,000,000\nattached to each of the seven\nproblems to be won by the\nfirst person to demonstrate\na correct solution. So if you\nthought maths couldn\u2019t make\nyou rich and famous, think\nagain!\nThe list of problems itself\nhas been carefully selected to\ninclude not only the most difficult ones, but also the ones\nwhose solutions would have a\nrelevance to areas of mathematics and the other sciences beyond the one in which\nthe problem was originally\nfor-mulated, hopefully leading to further serendipitous\ndiscoveries en route. Thus,\nfar from being formal exer-cises, the seven prize problems are widely considered\nthe most important problems\nin mathematics.\nIn an extended feature, I\npropose to look at each of the\nseven so-called millennium\nproblems in a non-special-ist manner and explain its\nsignificance, while conveying\nsome of the excitement contained in the mathematical\nconcepts behind it. The first\nproblem we consider is the P\nvs NP problem, notorious for\nthe plethora of false proofs it\nregularly attracts.\nP = NP?\nDespite a rather unassuming\nname, the P vs. NP problem is, in a way, the problem\nof all problems. Originating\nin the field of computational\ncomplexity theory, it is essentially concerned with how\neasy it is to solve problems\non a computer, or, put more\ncynically, whether computers\nwill eventually replace math-ematicians. Indeed, were this\nproblem to be solved in the\naffirmative, it is most likely\nthat a computer could furnish\nthe proofs to the remaining\nsix millennium problems.\nSo what do the symbols P\nand NP actually mean and\nwhy is their (in)equality so\ndifficult to ascertain?\nP and NP are just two of\nthe many classes in complexity theory used to distinguish\nbetween the difficulty of prob-lems. Generally speaking,\nproblems that are in P are\neasy to solve, while problems\nin NP are difficult to solve, but\nsignificantly, given an answer\nto an NP problem, it is easy to\nverify whether it is indeed a\nsolution. For example, many\nof the problems involved in\ndata processing, such as sorting information or searching\nand re-trieving, are instances\nof P-type problems. Formally,\nP stands for polynomial time,\nwhich means that the number\nof steps required to obtain a\nsolution can be expressed as\na polynomial in the length of\nthe input.\nOn the other hand, there\nare data-processing problems that are not so easy.\nConsider, for instance, the\n\u2018floppy-disk-packing\u2019 problem\nwhich asks whether, given a\nnumber of floppy disks and\na number of computer files,\nit is possible to copy all the\nfiles to the floppy disks. For\nsmall numbers of disks and\nfiles, it is straightforward\nto give an answer: you just\ngo through all the possible\ncombinations. However, if\nlarge numbers are involved,\nit quickly becomes very difficult to solve: the possibilities\nare simply too many. At the\nsame time, given a particular answer, you can reasonably easily check whether it\nis indeed a correct answer.\nThis is an example of an NPtype problem. Formally, NP\nstands for non-deterministic\npolynomial time and includes\nthe problems whose answers\ncan be checked in polynomial\ntime, given the right informa-tion.\nHowever, the \u2018floppy-disk\npacking\u2019 problem is not just\nany NP problem. It is in fact\nan NP-complete problem,\nwhich means that all other\nNP problems can be reduced\nto it. This includes some interesting examples, such as the\nproblem of prime factorisa-tion, which is in NP but is not\nknown to be NP-complete.\nBefore you get too excited,\nlet me point out that there\nare actually quite a few NPcomplete problems, so there\nis nothing special about our\nfloppy disk example. In fact,\nthere are a number of popular games that can be formulated as NP-complete prob-lems, among them checkers,\ncrossword puzzle generation,\nand even Minesweeper!\nLet us recall the actual\nproblem: is P equal to NP?\nIn other words, if the solutions to a problem are easy to\nverify, is it possible that the\nanswers can be easy to compute as well? It turns out that\nthis is a very difficult question to answer either way.\nWhether one is trying to\nprove or disprove the above\nproposition, the class of NPcomplete problems turns out\nto be crucial. For, if trying\nto prove P=NP\n, it would suffice to show that there is a\nmethod which can be used to\nsolve one of the NP-complete\nproblems in polynomial time\n(remember, an NP-complete\nproblem is such that all other\nNP problems can be reduced\nto it). Conversely, if trying\nto disprove P=NP\n, it would\nsuffice to demonstrate that\na certain NP-complete problem is not solvable in polynomial time (one way to do this\nwould be by showing that the\nleast time the problem could\nbe solved in is super-polyno-mial).\nAlthough this may sound\nlike a fairly abstract prob-lem, an affirmative proof\nwould have potentially stunning practical consequences.\nHundreds of NP-complete\nproblems are known, many\nof them related to scheduling and routing problems\nwith industrial importance.\nFor example, there is a problem concerning the fitting\nof oddly shaped items into\na knapsack, which is closely\nassociated with the question\nof placing components on a\ncircuit board, while the problem of constructing a working timetable for a school so\nthat teachers and students\nare never in two places at the\nsame time is similar to the\nproblem of placing pilots in\nan airline.\nPerhaps more importantly,\nhowever, there is the problem of factorising large num-bers, which lies at the heart\nof modern cryptography.\nThe codes routinely used to\nsecure worldwide financial\ntransactions are complexity-theory based and, in particu-lar, the proof of their security assumes P is not equal\nto NP\n. Were it to be proven\nthat P does equal NP\n, current\nciphers could become obsolete overnight.\nDespite such potentially\ndestructive consequences,\nthere are some of a more\npositive nature. For exam-ple, as mentioned earlier, an\naffirmative solution to the\nproblem will allow a computer to find a formal proof to\nany mathematical theorem,\nprovided it has a proof of reasonable length. More strik-ingly, it is thought that this\nmay be applied to other areas\nof creative human endeav-our, such as designing planes,\ncreating physical theories or\neven composing music, as in\neach case what is ultimately\nrequired is an efficient method for recognising a good\nresult. Finding such methods is one of the fundamental\nproblems in artificial intel-ligence, whose resolution\nwould be aided by a proof of\nthe P vs NP question.\nWith such momentous\nimplications, it is unsurprising that many people are\ninterested in finding a solution to this particular millennium problem. Indeed, an\nastonishing number of papers\nare regularly published purporting to have found a proof.\nHowever, ever since the problem was initially formulated\nin the 1970s, there has been\nno success, whatever the line\nof attack. This has prompted\nspeculations that the problem may be unsolvable after\nall and, in particular, G\u00f6del\u2019s\nincompleteness theorem has\nbeen invoked. In other words,\nit has been suggested that\nunder our current mathematical framework of assumptions it is not possible to\nprove whether P = NP\n. Some\nhave accordingly proposed\nthat \u2018P not equal to NP\u2019 (for\nthat is what most complexity theorists believe to be the\ncase) be established as a new\nassumption.\nOver time, the fact that a\nproof definitively settling the\nquestion one way or the other\nhas failed to materialise, has\nlent a somewhat metaphysical aura to the problem. In\ncomplexity theory circles,\nwhether P equals NP has\nbecome a matter of belief\nrather than a matter of established fact. When and if the\nproblem is finally resolved\n(and there is little indication\nof this happening in the foreseeable future), it is bound to\naffect the way we do science.\nPerhaps the picture is not\nso gloomy though: remember,\nall you have to do to solve the\nproblem and win the prize is\nsolve the equivalent NP-complete Minesweeper problem,\nwhich boils down to demonstrating an efficient algorithm\nfor playing Minesweeper perfectly (without unnecessary\nguesses)!\nWhy do the unsolved problems of maths matter?\nIn the first of a series of articles, Alex Antonov considers the significance of the toughest problems\nin mathematics. The P=NP problem is one of the most important of these\n\u201c...there is also the\nattractive price tag of\n$1,000,000 attached\nto each of the seven\nproblems...\u201d\n\u201c...an affirmative\nproof would have\npotentially stunning\nconsequences\u201d\n\u201cIndeed were this\nproblem to be solved it\nis most likely to\nfurnish the proofs to\nthe remaining six\nmillennium problems\u201d\nMinesweeper: we\u2019ve all played it, but did you know that it can be formulated as an NP\ncomplete problem, the solution of which would have widespread ramifications?\n\u201c...this has prompted\nspeculation that the\nproblem may be unsolv-able, and in particular,\nGodel\u2019s incompleteness theorem has been\ninvoked\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Cowboy seeks huge black erection\nDon your stetsons, strap on your six-guns and go questing for The Dark Tower with Oliver Finn\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u2018Childe Roland to the dark tower\ncame\u2019 \u2013 Robert Browning (1855)\nThese were the words of a narrative poem that inspired Stephen\nKing to begin his longest and arguably best work.\nThe Dark Tower series consists\nof seven parts. The first was written\nin 1982 and then for several years\nthe series lay abandoned, before\nbeing continued at a slow rate until\nthe late nineties. Readers who had\ntravelled with the characters were\nleft waiting at several points. In the\nlast few years, Stephen King has\ncompleted the series, with the last\ntwo volumes being published this\nyear.\nThe final instalment, The Dark\nTower, was released this autumn.\nUnfortunately for us poor stu-dents, this means that the last few\nbooks are only available in hardback at the moment. However, the\nhardback versions are very beautiful things, with colour plates scattered at various points throughout\nthe books.\nThe series is an epic fantasy\nadventure in a similar style to The\nLord of the Rings, but with different\natmospheres and characters. The\nfirst character we meet is Roland,\nthe last gunslinger, the lone gun-man, duster flapping in the wind as\nhe comes into town from the desert\nlike Clint Eastwood in High Plains\nDrifter, revolvers at his hips. At the\nsame time, he is a noble and the last\nof a royal line, part Arthurian knight,\npart diplomat and when necessary,\nall cold-eyed killer.\nThe characters weave in and\nout of post-apocalyptic landscapes\n(due to \u2018the world moving on\u2019), classic spaghetti western scenes and\ntwisted versions of legends and\nfairytales as they pass through\nenvironments that could be taken\nfrom Stephen Kings other books and\nwhich, as the story progresses, actually are.\nHaving read quite a lot of King\u2019s\nwork, I can easily imagine Roland\nand his companions, Eddie the\nreformed junkie, Susanna, Jake and\nOy (the talking Billy Bumbler \u2013 a\nkind of dog) appearing in the background of his other stories, especially ones like The Stand, and this\nis one of the reasons for the gap in\nthe series.\nStephen King was in some way\nwriting of Roland\u2019s world whilst he\nwrote all of the rest of his books.\nThey all fit in somewhere to the\nmythology and world that the Dark\nTower series is set in, some with\nmore relevance than others. I have\nsometimes been disappointed with\nthe endings of King\u2019s books, but as\nhe says himself in one of the many\nepilogues, this is perhaps because\nhe lost track of the character in\nthis particular story as the character has moved on into the Dark\nTower series. Thankfully, after wading through the thousands of pages\nof this series, I was not disappointed\nwith the finale.\nRoland\u2019s quest is for the dark\ntower, the hub of existence, at the\ncentre of all worlds. He believes that\non reaching the tower he will be able\nto prevent \u2018the decay of worlds\u2019, to\nprevent the rest of the worlds moving on and decaying like his own\ndid through war, plague and loss of\nknowledge. But that is not the main\nreason for the quest: just as one of\nRoland\u2019s companions is a heroin\naddict, Roland is a \u2018Tower Junkie\u2019,\ndriven to get to the tower, leaving a trail of bodies of both friends\nand enemies in his relentless and\ndogged pursuit of his goal through\ntime and space.\nYou may be familiar with the concept of alternate realities, either\nthrough quantum theory or (perhaps\njust as likely at Imperial) through\nmovies such as Jet Li\u2019s The One.\nIn these different times and places,\nthe heroes encounter modern day\nNew York as well as other worlds\neerily similar to our own. The villains of the piece are a varied cast: a\nsinister man in black whom Roland\nis pursuing from the outset of the\nfirst book and the master villain, the\nCrimson King, as well as vampires,\nrobots, evil magic users, insane AIs\nand post-apocalyptic survivors such\nas those found in Mad Max and the\nMafia.\nThe series starts with the stories\nof each of Roland\u2019s companions as\nhe draws them from their own place\nand time in our world. At the same\ntime Roland\u2019s own history develops in flashbacks and tales told by\nthe gunslinger himself. One book,\nWizard and Glass (the fourth in the\nseries) is almost entirely devoted to\nthis angle.\nThe books make gripping reading,\nand, if nothing else, the series is a\npage-turner. I am glad I waited until\nthe last books were released before\nI began reading: the wait of a week\nor so between getting hold of books\nis bad enough, so I can\u2019t imagine\nwhat the initial fans went through,\nhaving to wait the better part of two\ndecades for their next tale.\nThe books are typical Stephen\nKing: in some cases needlessly and\ncrassly sexually explicit, in others a\nlittle too weird, stretching the imagination of even a willing reader.\nOne very refreshing thing is that\nhowever attached you are to the\ncharacters, you know that any of\nthem might fall by the wayside, and\nthis helps remove the kind of \u2018the\nhero is invincible\u2019 sense that some\nfantasy fiction books have. It makes\nthe story more \u2018realistic\u2019, if such a\nword can be applied to this undoubtedly odd tale, as well as creating\nsuspense.\nThese books were responsible for\nseveral late nights as I was unable\nto turn the light out and sleep \u2013 I\njust had to know what came next.\nPerhaps not classic literature, but\nthey are a very good read.\n\u25cf The Dark Tower series consists\nof:\nThe Gunslinger (1982)\nThe Drawing of the Three (1987)\nThe Waste Lands (1991)\nWizard and Glass (1997)\nWolves of the Calla (2003)\nSong of Susannah (2004)\nThe Dark Tower (2004)\nThe Dark Tower\nby Stephen King\n(Donald M Grant Publishing)\nHHHHI\n\u201cThe most important discovery of\nall time\u201d is the claim Simon Singh\nmakes of the Big Bang (also known\nas the HSK) model. Indeed, it is\nhard to think of many scientific discoveries more fundamental than\nthe theory of the beginning of eve-rything. Does the book, however,\nlive up to its explosive title?\nBig Bang is very cleverly struc-tured, running backwards and forwards through time simultaneously\n(although, there is no such thing\nas simultaneity, of course). Singh\nstarts with the ancients\u2019 studies of\nthe earth, moves on to the understanding of the sun-centred solar\nsystem in the renaissance, through\nto the discovery of galaxies outside\nour own in the 20th century, and\nthen to quasars. As time passes,\nastronomers have been able to see\nfurther and further away and, due\nto the finite nature of the speed of\nlight, further into the past. Hence,\nSingh describes mankind\u2019s probing\nfurther and further into the past,\nreaching, inevitably, the Big Bang.\nThe strongest point of the book is\nthat it leaves in the details that first\nyear mechanics lectures left out for\nsome reason. For example, I never\nrealised that Tycho Brahe had a pet\nelk. Also, from the rather solemn\npictures of Tycho himself, no-one\nwould expect the astronomer to be\nsuch a party animal (the pet elk\nin question died after falling down\nthe stairs due to excessive alcohol\nconsumption, apparently).\nThis book does well to place the\nscience in context \u2013 although Pius\nXII, Igor Stravinsky and viagra\ncontributed very little to the HSK\nmodel, the book reminds us that\nscience doesn\u2019t take place in a vac-uum.\nThe style Singh uses is, under-standably, geared towards non-sci-entists, and so I believe that anybody would be able to enjoy this\nbook. The range of physics he covers is very broad, including classical\nmechanics, relativity, atomic and\nnuclear physics, electromagnetism\nas well as the obvious astrophysics and cosmology. These are all\nexplained very effectively, although\nsome physicists will find a few of the\nexplanations slightly tedious. There\nare some more complicated points\nin the epilogue to keep everyone on\ntheir toes, though.\nThe major criticism I have of Big\nBang is that its greatest strength\nalso shows its flaws. Despite the\neffective telling the story of the HSK,\nit does skip over a few characters\n\u2013 the roles of Lorentz, Poincare and\nSchott, for example, are missed out\ncompletely. The phrase \u201cChadwick\ndiscovered the neutron\u201d, along with\na picture claiming to show the exterior of the laboratory where he did\nit, will doubtless have a few people up in arms. Also, the sense of\nhumour is slightly bad at times. I\nam one of the worst offenders as\nfar as appalling physics jokes are\nconcerned, but still, Singh takes\nit to the limit. Describing Franz\nZwicky as the leader of \u201cThe TiredLight Brigade,\u201d and the recession of\ngalaxies in terms of the Milky Way\u2019s\n\u201cCosmic body odour\u201d... there is only\nso much that I can stand! But then\nagain, this is a matter of personal\ntaste.\nOf course, there is a strong connection to the college. Singh used\nto be president of the Royal College\nof Science Union, as well as editor\nof the physics student magazine,\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat. Those of you\nwith sharp eyes may recognise a\nfew names Singh mentions inci-dentally, in particular Huxley and\n(a more recent example) RowanRobinson.\nSo, overall, Big Bang is an interesting read, but don\u2019t expect too\nmuch deep physics from it. It is,\nafter all, a popular science book, and\nit does what it sets out to do well.\nOh, and what does HSK stand for?\nAccording to Calvin and Hobbes, it\u2019s\nthe \u2018Horrendous Space Kablooie\u2019.\nNicolas Osman\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004 21\nBig Bang\nby Simon Singh\n(Simon & Schuster)\nHHHHI\nBookshops hit by Big Bang\nBig Bang author Simon Singh at Imperial College\n\n"

I\u2019m currently\nbuilding up for my final gig where\nI\u2019m doing a ten hour set with Danny\nTenaglia [for the MADE Event and\nBe Yourself party at the club Roxy,\nin New York]. It\u2019s been really hectic\nrecently.\nHow do you think the London\nclub scene compares to the\nrest of the world?\nI don\u2019t really get much time in\nLondon except at my own night,\nHarlem Nights at The End. Although\nit\u2019s one of the smallest parties I play\nit\u2019s the one I\u2019m the most proud of. I\nbuilt that night up myself and it is\none of my favourites to play. There is\na regular crowd, it\u2019s steady and it\u2019s a\ngood night.\nDo you enjoy your marathon\nsets there?\nLong sets are good when there\u2019s a\ngood vibe. When the music\u2019s great\nand the crowd\u2019s loving it, you are at\nthe helm of that and I could play for\n15 hours if the night was going well!\nWhen you\u2019re not DJing, how\ndo you chill out?\nI love movies and directors, and I\nchill out by drawing the curtains\nand taking some time to myself with\na film and a smoke. When I\u2019m not\ndoing that, I\u2019m in the studio making songs. I recently remixed Dido\u2019s\nSand In My Shoes and it\u2019s currently\nnumber one in the US Billboard\nDance Chart. I also recently\nremixed the club anthem I Can\u2019t\nExplain by Bombdog. It was tough\nto remix because it was such a big\noriginal. I supported it and played\nit lots though so I wanted to remix\nit.\nWhat are your best memories\nof a night spent in London?\nThere have been a couple of good\nones this year: there was a night in\nOctober this year which was phenomenal with 300 people still trying to get in at 3am! It was crazy!\nAnother good night was the second\nbirthday of Harlem Nights which\nwas an awesome party. I play to\ncrowds of 1000 to 20,000 people but\nthe best nights are the ones where\nthe crowd are really into the music,\nwhich is why I love doing Harlem\nNights.\nDo you have any \u2018insider tips\u2019\nfor clubbers at the moment?\nArgentina definitely has the best\ncrowd reaction; they really know\nhow to party there. Another of my\nfavourite places is Romania, on the\nBlack Sea Coast \u2013 there is a great\ncrowd and an awesome sound sys-tem.\nSo how do you usually get\naround to all these places?\nWell I\u2019m based mainly in Miami,\nIbiza and Birmingham and travelling between places is tough. I live\nin Ibiza during the summer months\nand have a house in Birmingham.\nEven though I make about four\nflights a week, I really don\u2019t like fly-ing. Airports are terrible places.\nSo in an ideal world how would\nyou like to get around?\nTeleport! One minute you could be in\nRome, then America, and then India\nat the touch of a button! More seri-ously, private jets are best because\nyou can even smoke on board.\nOk, some quick fire questions\nnow: sightseeing or the arts?\nSightseeing, definitely.\nChinese or curry?\nChinese\nHaagen Dazs or Ben & Jerry\u2019s?\nHaagen Dazs\nIf you see street performers,\ndo you stop and watch or walk\non by?\nStop and watch! There are lots of\nstreet performers in New York.\nAnd finally, do you have any\ntips for students who want to\nget into DJing?\nThere are two things you can do,\nthe first is get into production. If you\nmake good tracks, people will listen.\nA good example is Nick Fantuli \u2013 he\nproduced a lot of good music and\neventually had to be recognised as\na good DJ with all of the support he\nhad.\nThe second way is to run your own\nnight that survives on the strength\nof itself, not DJs you bring in \u2013\nsomething that is a good party in its\nown right.\n\u25cf Visit Steve\u2019s website at\nwww.djstevelawler.com, or\nvisit www.endclub.com for\nmore information on Harlem\nNights\nInterview: Steve Lawler\nThe DJ took some time out from his hectic schedule to chat to Nichola Jahn about his music\nand lifestyle from his hotel room in New York\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004\n18\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nSteve Lawler: catch him at Harlem Nights at The End\n\u201cLong sets are good\nwhen there\u2019s a good\nvibe...

    "content": "Business business.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 December 2004 3\nMore oil, anyone?\nNo doubt the extensive coverage of crude oil prices has given you information\noverload. Ben Hasted demystifies all\nWelcome to the first of what\nwill hopefully become relatively regular articles here\nin the Felix business section.\nFollowing on from our business editor\u2019s brief foray into\ncrude oil price rises, I felt an\nurge to elaborate on the fascinating issues causing the\nprices to rise faster than...\nwell, something rising very\nfast!\nAs I write, oil prices are\nabout 60% higher than they\nwere in January. This certainly begs the question, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nThe increase in price has\nbeen caused by several contributing factors, some of\nwhich have been on the front\npages of even the \u2018less than\nquality\u2019 newspapers.\nThe demand for oil has\nincreased worldwide; two\nmajor players are the United\nStates and China. The US has\na greater need for oil now\nthat its economic recovery\nhas gained strength (all those\ngas-guzzling SUVs have to get\nfuel from somewhere) whilst\nChina\u2019s economy is expanding at such a rapid rate that\nits demand has increased by\n20% over the past year.\nIn the drive for cost-cutting\nthat all companies undergo\nevery so often, many oil companies have tried to enhance\nefficiency by operating with\nlower stocks of crude oil.\nThese stocks provide a cushion when a supply interruption occurs for whatever rea-son, and so it follows that with\nless stock comes less cushion\n\u2013 those supply interruptions\nhave much more of an impact\non prices now.\nOPEC (a producers\u2019 cartel\naccountable for about half the\nworld\u2019s oil exports) tries to\nkeep oil prices where they\nwant them by decreasing or\nincreasing the supply of oil\nto the market. In the past,\nthey tended to wait for a price\ndip before cutting output, but\nrecently they have been acting more aggressively and\nhave tried to pre-empt weakening of prices by cutting output early.\nPolitical tensions throughout the Middle East, which\nremains the main source of\noil for the world\u2019s major con-sumers, and violence in Iraq\nhave undermined confidence\nin the security of supply from\nthe region. Iraqi exports have\nactually been cut by sabotage attacks on oil facilities,\nand whilst the reduction in\nexports is relatively small, it\nhas concerned analysts and\ncast doubt over Iraq\u2019s future\nas a stable oil exporter.\nThis lack of confidence, and\nthe possibility (some would\nsay certainty) of further violence in the Middle East,\nexpose the market to sudden price rises if supplies are\nthreatened. Speculators are\nvery much aware of this and\nare betting on higher prices.\nThis in turn exacerbates the\nprice pressure in the market,\nand OPEC officials have even\ngone so far as to blame speculators for the price surge this\nyear.\nThere are other factors,\nsuch as the US\u2019 lack of refining\ncapabilities: environmental\nregulations demand different\ngrades of gasoline, varying\nfrom state to state, making\ncatering for these different\nmarkets difficult. This, along\nwith environmental concerns\nabout building new refineries,\ncan make planning permission expensive and difficult\nto obtain. Combine this with\nworries about the stability of\nNigeria, Norway and Russia\u2019s\noil production and you have a\ngood many reasons for hikes\nin prices.\nRecently, oil prices did take\na small dip when reports\narrived of an unexpected\nincrease in US oil stocks,\nbut analysts remain far from\noptimistic in hopes for steadily falling prices. One analyst\nsaid: \u201cA cold snap or a problem somewhere or other and\nwe could easily revisit those\nhigh levels,\u201d so let\u2019s keep our\nfingers crossed for a hot winter worldwide!\nAs you can see, there is\nno one contributing factor to\nthe increase in oil prices and,\nunfortunately for us, the best\nwe can do at the moment is\nhope that the US sells all its\nSUVs and world peace happens tomorrow!\nLatest\nfrom the\nSquare\nMile\nBy Numaan Chaudhry\nBusiness Editor\nFurther Flight Fight\nMyTravel, the troubled holiday group, revealed last weekend that it faces the prospect\nof being fined thousands of\npounds by the FSA, the UK\nfinancial services regulatory\nbody. The announcement\ncame amid a restructuring of\nMyTravel\u2019s \u00a3800m debt, much\nof which is held by bondhold-ers Lehman Brothers and\nFidelity. Although the bond-holders voted against the\nrestructuring, a high court\nruling approved the subsequent plea and allowed a\ndebt-for-equity exchange, a\nmechanism allowing the firm\nto free itself from debt but\nkeep the capital raised from\nthe initial bond issue.\nViktor vs Viktor\nJudges in Ukraine have\nhalted the crowning of Viktor\nYanukovych, the recently\nelected Ukrainian prime\nminister, after mass rebellion by eastern Ukraine and\nhis opposition leader, Viktor\nYushchenko. The immediate\nappointment of Yanukovich\ncould have led to civil war\nafter there were rumours of\na fraudulent election and artificially created poll results.\nA difference of 2.85% caused\nthe stir and subsequent mass\nstrikes that have demanded the attention of the US,\nEuropean Union governments and Nato.\nChaudhry\u2019s rating\nChaudhry anticipates a move\nupwards in the FTSE 100\nindex over the coming weeks\nas the dollar continues to\nweaken and hence increases\nthe cost for exporters from\nthe UK. However, EU exporters will feel the strain as the\neuro continues to strengthen\nagainst both the pound and\ndollar. Although this is by no\nmeans the only reason for\nmarkets to move, we should\nexpect the FTSE Euro 100\nto dip.\nBy Beccy Knights\nEntrepreneurs Challenge\nManager\nThis is the question that ten\nlucky Imperial students will\nhave to answer on Thursday\n9 December.\nThe Entrepreneurs\u2019 Challenge, now in its fifth year,\nis one of the world\u2019s biggest\nstudent business plan compe-titions. The \u2018Ideas Challenge\u2019,\nthe first part of the competi-tion, ran this term and asked\nfor a 2-3 page summary of\na business idea.

Don\u2019t forget\nto join us afterwards to celebrate with festive drinks\nand snacks in the Tanaka\nBusiness School!\nDavid Begg, Principal of the\nTanaka Business School, will\nbe awarding the prizes to this\nyear's winners and runners-up. Which ideas will the judges find the most innovative\nand convincing this year? You\ncan judge for yourself as the\nten winners try to convince\nyou of their idea through their\nelevator pitches.\nThe Challenge is open to\nall Imperial College students,\nundergraduate and post-graduate, and is run by the\nEntrepreneurship Centre in\nthe Tanaka Business School.\nStudents do not need to have\nprior business or commercial\nexperience to enter. Previous\nwinners have come from a\nvariety of departments,\nincluding physics, medicine,\nmechanical engineering,\nindustrial design engineering\nand biological sciences.\nTeams that have taken\npart in the Entrepreneurs\u2019\nChallenge have been successful in London-wide as\nwell as international business plan competitions, proving Imperial\u2019s students to be\namong the best at developing\nand presenting ideas. Some\nteams have also gone on to\nraise investment capital to\nmake their businesses a real-ity.\nThe competition attracts\ncompanies such as McKinsey,\nIBM, Psion, Shell, HP\n, HSBC,\nBarclays Capital, Amadeus\nCapital and Innocent Drinks\nto sponsor the competition or\npass on their expertise to our\nstudents, meaning entrants\nhave a wealth of experience\navailable to them as they\nput their business plans\ntogether.\nWhat would you do with \u00a31000?\nThe Ferrari Scaglietti 612: the term \u2018gas guzzler\u2019 is an understatement for this \u00a3150,000 beaut.

The team\nis finally beginning to work\ntogether even with the squad\nonly technically consisting of\nsix players at the moment\ndue to injuries!\nThe first quarter saw us get\noff to a flying start, quickly taking a four goal lead. With our\ncentral play much improved,\nour captain Alberta worked\nthe ball up the court effortlessly with the help of Stux at\nwing attack, a change from\nher normal position. They fed\nthe ball into the shooters who\nwere both on fire \u2013 hardly a\nsingle shot was off target!\nThe second and third\nquarters were fairly evenly\nmatched, and while we\ncouldn\u2019t pull away, we didn\u2019t\nlet them eat into our lead\neither. Defence was tight\nfrom the whole team, and we\nstayed positive despite the\nmatch feeling like it was at\nstalemate.\nThe last quarter saw the\nusual scrappy end you always\nget in a close match like this,\nbut thankfully they cracked\nbefore we did, and we were\nable to slightly extend our\nlead before the final whistle.\nOur team is finally being to\ntake shape, and with two out\nof two home wins, we just\nneed to figure out how to win\naway...\nNETBALL\nAnother win for Firsts\nBUSA Short Course\nChampionships,\nSheffield\nBy Sakura Hingley\nThis year, for the first time\nin the Swimming Club\u2019s his-tory, Imperial College was\nrepresented at the BUSA\nShort Course Swimming\nChampionships.\nThe team consisted of nine\nswimmers with a variety of\nswimming experience. Some\nwere regular competitors,\nwhile others had never competed in a large venue such\nas Ponds Forge in Sheffield,\nwhere the competition was\ntaking place.\nThe first session began\nat 6pm on the Friday after-noon, with the 800m freestyle,\nswum by Sophie Mitchinson,\nand the 200m freestyle relay\nevents. Considering that we\nmissed the warm-up due\nto the appalling traffic, all\nevents were swum superbly,\nespecially by the boys\u2019 team\nwho showed their sprinting\nstrength.\nSessions two and three\non the Saturday also demonstrated the strength that\nthe Imperial swimmers have\nbeen building up to over\nthe last couple of months in\npreparation for the competi-tion: Sarah, Sakura and Jon\nall powered through the 200m\nwith respectable times, while\nthere were brilliant sprints\nswum by Alison and Hugh\nin the 50m breaststroke and\nJonathan in the 50m back-stroke.\nThe afternoon also showed\npromising swims from other\nteam members. Dan was\nplaced in a fast heat and\nshowed his backstroke power\nwhilst Gianluca, although a\nbit wobbly at the start, shot\nthrough the 50m freestyle.\nThe proudest moment for\nthe team came when Sophie\nMitchinson qualified for the\n200m backstroke final, which\nwas swum that evening. All\nthe team were present on\npoolside as she walked to\nher block and her name was\nannounced: \u201cRepresenting\nImperial College, Sophie\nMitchinson\u201d. Pride and joy\nfilled us all. Sophie did the\nImperial name proud by\nswimming a wonderful time\nof 2:31.10 and is now ranked\ntenth fastest BUSA 200m\nbackstroke swimmer 2004.\nFor the last day of competi-tion, Sunday, everyone clambered back to the pool side\nin dribs and drabs, tired from\nthe day(s) before. The heats\nwere swum in the morning,\nincluding Gianluca swimming\nthe 100m freestyle; Rodrigo\nand Hugh both slightly disappointed by their 100m breaststroke swims; Daniel swimming a good 200m IM; Sarah\nand Alison proving their\nstrength in the 50m butterfly;\nand Jon very pleased with\na new personal best for his\n100m backstroke.\nDue to her time entered for\nthe 400m freestyle, Sophie\nwas entered into the fastest heat, which meant that\nshe once again managed to\nget into a final (as the fastest heat was to be swum in\nthe finals in the afternoon).\nDespite being disappointed\nby her own time, she touched\nthe wall in eighth place, again\nraising the level of success\nhigher for the Imperial team.\nAfter a strenuous but exciting and successful three days\nfor the nine Imperial swim-mers, it was back to the minibus for another long drive\nback to London. Everyone\nhad had a brilliant weekend\nand was ready to get back\ninto the water for more vigorous training to prepare for\nthe next trip to Ponds Forge\n\u2013 the BUSA Long Course\nChampionships in February.\nIf you would like more information on when and where\nwe train, or any other information about the Swimming\nClub, please have a look at our\nwebsite, www.union.ic.ac.uk/\nacc/swimming.

We\nsuffered from throwaways\nand drops (Cripple dropped\na pitch-length hammer from\nMagic), but some stunning\ncorner cuts by Stylish, and\nsolid handling from Captain\nNeville and Magic, raised our\ngame and resulted in a win.\nDisc Doctors 3\nBrunel Stop Throwing\nDiscs (STD) I 8\nWe knew this was going to\nbe tough. Brunel have some\nvery accomplished handlers,\ncomplemented with very\nnippy tall beginners. We were\nfar too slow in noticing and\nreacting to their variant of\nthe horizontal stack, and\nsuffered as a result of some\ncheeky break-force scoobers\nby Brunel\u2019s handlers.\nDisc Doctors 5\nEast Anglia Aye-Aye II 6\nWe went into this one with\nthe wrong attitude. We\nwalked all over this team at\noutdoor regionals in March,\nand thought we could do the\nsame again indoors. Things\nstarted going wrong as soon\nas the game started. Aye Aye\n2 had many faces we recognised from years before, and\nput strong pressure on from\nthe start, resulting in throwaways from our men with big\nthrows, and a notable foot\npoint-block against Neville.\nWe traded points for most of\nthe game, we had difficulty\nhearing \u201cup\u201d and \u201cman-on\u201d\ncalls because Aye Aye 1 and\n2 drowned out all other noise\n(they won the \u201cloudest team\naward\u201d), and lost in sudden\ndeath.\nTHE PARTY\nAfter spending an hour walking into Brighton after taking\na bus from our host\u2019s campus,\nsix of us settled for a KFC fat-feast, while Stylish, Steve-O\nand Boon hunted down an\neat-in curry house. The hosts\u2019\nparty in Brighton\u2019s Lectern\npub followed. This venue is\nsurely a contender for the\n\u2018dingiest pub in the south\neast award\u2019. It was grotty,\nhalf-painted, it had bin-liners\nfor curtains, it had an inexplicably sticky carpet, and\nthe prices horrified our team,\nwhich was used to Southside\nspecial offers.\nOur friends from Thrown\n(the KCL Ultimate team)\ninvited us to join them at\nCasablanca Jazz Club on\nBrighton\u2019s seafront. Five of\nus went along and experienced three and a half hours\nof amazing funk, sprinkled\nwith some jazzy house, Daft\nPunk, Jacko, Dee-lite, and the\nBeastie Boys, served-up by a\nDJ working behind the front\nhalf of a VW Beetle.\nDAY TWO\nDisc Doctors 8\nBrunel STD II 1\nOur first games on Sundays\nare historically our worst. We\nwere fortunate, however, and\ngiven a bit of space to make\nmistakes, partly thanks to\nK-man making several good\nD\u2019s at the back, allowing us\na comfortable win against\nBrunel\u2019s second team.\nDisc Doctors 13\nCambridge Strange\nBlue II 2\nThis game involved some\nseriously sexy play from the\nDisc Doctors. We had good\nflow and eye contact, and\nplayed our best Ultimate\nof the weekend. The score-line did not do credit to\nStrange Blue II, who put up a\ngood fight throughout, in\nwhat was a very well-spirited\ngame.\nDisc Doctors 6\nKCL Thrown 7\nWe were taken aback by the\nintensity of KCL\n\u2019s offensive\nplay. We could not use lack\nof indoors practice, lack of\nexperience playing as a team,\nor even the increasingly\ndusty and slippery floor as\nexcuses, because KCL were\nin the same position as us.\nPoints were traded throughout despite top play from\nNaiff, and the game ended in\nsudden death, again, with a\nthrowaway close to our zone\nand quick turnaround from\nKings to win the game.\nTHE RESULT\nSo we finished tenth in our\nregion. We were served a\nhealthy portion of concentrated humble pie pur\u00e9e last\nweekend. We\u2019ve sucked it\nup, and now we\u2019re ready to\nspit it out. Our outdoor game\nhas always been better than\nour indoor game, and with\nthe new beginner talent we\u2019ve\nrecruited and numerous\none-day open and student\ntournaments to be held in\nLondon, the Disc Doctors\nwill doubtless soon earn the\ntitle of \u201cmost feared up and\ncoming team in the south\neast\u201d.\nDisc Doctors finish tenth\nin region\nSwimmers (left to right): Sarah Skennerton, Sakura\nHingley, Jonathan Page, Daniel Houcke, Gianluca\nGuiccardi, Rodrigo Marino-Gonzalez, Hugh Ip, Alison Coyle\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 4\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 5th 2\nBy Sam Styles\nImperial Sevenths started\nwith their revolutionary new\n5-4-1 formation which has\nhalted a run of six defeats in\na row and led to wins in the\nlast two fixtures.\nClearly the better of the two\nteams in the opening stages,\nImperial dominated the first\n20 minutes. As the pressure\nmounted, a goal seemed inev-itable. It came at the wrong\nend, however, as in the 20th\nminute QM broke quickly with\na long ball through to their\nnumber 10. With the Imperial\ndefence\u2019s usually highly effective tactic of appealing loudly\nfor offside when a striker is\nthrough on goal impressing\nneither referee nor linesman,\nArio was left helpless at the\nback as the striker made it\n1-0 to QM.\nThegamesettledintoamore\neven pattern after the goal as\nQM grew in confidence, and\nit looked as though Imperial\nwould find themselves 1-0\ndown at half-time. But two\nquick Imperial goals before\nthe break ensured this would\nnot be the case and gave the\nSevenths a deserved halftime lead. Firstly Thom fed\nJack who, one on one with the\nkeeper, unselfishly squared\nthe ball to the supporting\nRyan who stroked the ball\ninto the unguarded goal. Five\nminutes later Stefan made a\nsurging run from centre half.\nIntercepting on the halfway\nline, he beat three men on a\ncharge up the left touchline\nbefore smashing the ball past\nthe \u2018keeper.\nThe second half was a much\nscrappier affair, with the QM\nteam pushing forward without ever really threatening\nthe Imperial goal. The QM\ndefence was sitting very high\nup the pitch, and this was\nexploited in the 55th minute\nwhen Geordie found Leo on\nthe right wing. Leo beat his\nman before dribbling into the\nbox and shooting low into the\nfar corner, 3-1 Imperial. More\npressure followed as Geordie\nhit the corner of post and bar\nwith a sweet curler from 30\nyards and Tuan shot straight\nat the keeper when clean\nthrough.\nTwice this season Imperial\nhave thrown 3-1 leads away\nto lose 4-3, and it looked\nas if we could be punished\nfor our poor finishing yet\nagain as QM pulled a goal\nback. However, any fears\nof the Sevenths throwing\nyet another lead away were\nextinguished almost immediately by the QM \u2018keeper,\nwho, having seemingly completed a comfortable save,\nsomehow contrived to throw\nGeordie\u2019s 25-yard left-footed\ndrive through his legs and\ninto the net.\nFOOTBALL\nSevenths success\n\n"

Unfortunately these days\nit seems that to study at university\nyou need to get into debt. This of\ncourse means that students need to\nbe much more aware of their financial position and the money they are\nspending.\nEspecially at this time of year\nleading up to Christmas, money\ncan be very tight among the student community, not just because\nsome people like to spend money\non presents for friends and families,\nbut also because they can get a bit\nexcited and spend their student loan\nvery quickly.\nBelow are some dos and don\u2019ts of\ndebt, courtesy of the Union Advice\nService.\nDo...\nBudget\nThe modern university experience\nrequires excellent budgeting skills.\nWork out exactly what essential\ncosts you have each month (rent,\nfood, bills etc) and then divide what\nyou have left into weekly amounts.\nTry taking that amount out at the\nstart of the week and sticking to it,\nrather than making numerous trips\nto the cash point.\nChoose your bank carefully\nPeople are more likely to divorce\nthan change banks, according to one\nold adage, so think carefully about\nwho you choose to bank with. Don\u2019t\nbe sucked in by free promotional\noffers when you open the account.\nFind out what the deal is for repaying that interest-free student over-draft; you may end up with a whacking interest rate the minute you\nleave your final exam.\nCheck everything you\u2019re entitled\nto. The Advice Service can tell you\nabout your eligibility to apply for a\nhardship loan.\nWork sensibly\n90% of students are now forced to\nwork during their course just to\nkeep their heads above water. Think\nabout when you are likely to be most\nbusy with exams and essays and\ntry to fit in more hours during the\nquieter periods.\nDon\u2019t...\nThink you\u2019re loaded\nThe first instalment of a student\nloan may look like a considerable\namount of money. However, remember that this has to last you all term\nand once the essentials are taken\nout it is clearly not a ticket to go on\na spending spree.\nKeep quiet about financial\nproblems\nNot everyone finds it easy to talk\ncandidly about their financial situa-tion. Do not bottle these problems\nup in the hope that they will go away\n\u2013 they won\u2019t. Speak to the Union\nAdvice Service, who will be able\nto advise you on managing your\nmoney.\nSpend money you don\u2019t have\nSpending money you know you don\u2019t\nhave in your bank account is a very\nexpensive way of solving any short-term problems. Many banks charge\nbig fees for any unauthorised trans-action. In some cases you could be\npaying a daily charge if you have\ngone over your limit, as well as\nadministration costs of around \u00a320\nper letter should the bank decide to\nwrite and inform you of your misde-meanour.\nGive into peer pressure\nUniversity is a fantastic experience\nand there is generally something\ngoing on 24 hours a day. However,\nwhen you cannot afford to do some-thing, you cannot afford to do it.\nDon\u2019t accept loans from friends to\nfund an evening out \u2013 they may not\nbe quite so friendly when you cannot\npay them back.\nPlease be aware that if things get\nreally bad and you have exhausted\nall areas of income, the College have\nthe access to learning fund which\nyou may be eligible for.

To some extent\nthis has manifested itself in additional vigilance but it has also, argu-ably, led to a degree of paranoia.\nExploitation of that paranoia has\nenabled politicians and administrators to introduce draconian new leg-islation, procedures and practises\nthat interfere with and aim to control the day-to-day lives of ordinary\ncitizens.\nIt\u2019s often stated that where\nAmerica jumps, the world follows.\nThe new \u2018security conscious\u2019 climate\nhas certainly been crossing over\nthe Atlantic and embedding itself\nhere. First, the Government introduced \u2018emergency\u2019 powers in the\nAnti-Terrorism Crime and Security\nAct 2001. Amongst other affronts\non civil liberties, this enabled the\nHome Secretary to detain foreign\nterror suspects, indefinitely, without\ncharge. [Those of you who have\nbeen following the case of former\nImperial student Babar Ahmad will\nknow that this legal instrument was\nused to hold him without charge\n- see Colin Smith\u2019s article on the\nopposite page.] In order to pass this\nlegislation, the Government had to\nopt out of the European Convention\non Human Rights, which it itself\nhad introduced into UK law with the\nHuman Rights Act 1998.\nThe Government is now following\nits anti-terror legislation with a controversial bill to introduce National\nIdentity Cards, as outlined in the\nQueen\u2019s speech last week. Civil liberties campaigners are up in arms\nover proposals that would enable\nlaw enforcement agencies \u2013 and others \u2013 to have access to unprecedented levels of personal information on\neach and every one of us.\nThe trouble when governments\nbecome Orwellian is that the culture gets embedded in all levels of\nsociety. And it\u2019s on that basis that\ndevelopments in Imperial College\nsecurity policies trouble me.\nWhen I was a first year undergrad-uate, back in October 1999, security was mainly behind the scenes.\nSecurity guards did not wear cheap-looking imitation police caps; nor\ndid they wear bright \u2018dayglow\u2019 jack-ets. You would see security guards\naround but they generally wouldn\u2019t\nbother you too much. No-one would\never ask you for ID as you walked\nto and from classes \u2013 though in my\ndepartment (computing) it was common for security to do an ID card\ncheck in the computer lab every\nnow and then to stop students from\nother departments using our superior facilities.\nNow security is much more overt\nand visible, and it\u2019s beginning to\nget intrusive. Every student or staff\nmember who walks into the Tanaka\nbusiness school is confronted by a\nless than friendly looking security\nguard requesting to see your swipe\ncard. (You\u2019d have thought that if\nthis was really important someone\nwould have at least installed a swipe\ncard reader or barrier.) Aside from\nfeeling sorry for the poor guard who\nhas to stand there all day doing the\nmost boring job imaginable, I wonder where this is all leading us.\nI do appreciate that security needed a shake-up \u2013 there had been\ntoo many mumblings about security\nguards failing to prevent thefts of\nproperty around College. And I do\nrecognise that, particularly on the\nmedical sites, there is a high degree\nof sensitive research that needs to\nbe secure. (I tested my swipe card\non the door of the nuclear reactor\ncentre at Silwood Park and was both\ndisappointed and relieved when it\nfailed to let me in.)\nYet there\u2019s something deeply\nunsettling about having to wear ID\ncards around your neck at all times\nand having to prove your identity\nbefore you attend a lecture. This is\nan academic institution, and one of\nthe basic principles of academia is\nthe freedom to explore the boundaries of knowledge. Draconian security practices do not, in my mind,\nengender the sort of culture in\nwhich academics and students feel\n\u2018free\u2019. Their value is also question-able. Most major thefts happen out\nof hours when most buildings are on\nswipe access anyway.\nAlso, the College is now considering whether to make it compulsory\nfor students to provide certification of vaccination against meningitis and mumps as a condition of\nentry. Other universities, such as\nBristol, are considering the same.\nThe intentions are well-minded (this\nyear nearly 600 first years received\nmeningitis vaccinations after term\nhad started, leaving them vulnerable to an outbreak) and it is\nintended that there be some flex-ibility. Nevertheless there are some\nserious issues of civil liberties and\nmedical ethics to consider here. Is it\nright that your university (or indeed\nanyone) should be able to force you\nto take a vaccination in order to\nstudy? (Medics already have to take\na hepatitis B jab for clinical prac-tice, but that\u2019s because of patient\ncontact.) Whatever you think about\nit, this is probably a breach of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human\nRights.\nUpcoming legislation in the next\nfew months and years may mean\nthat the College is either required\n(or feels that it is required) to do\nsecurity vetting of students before\nthey can work in certain research\nareas. This could be sensible in some\ncircumstances, such as protecting\nvivisectionists from more militant\nanimal rights activists. A more likely\nreason for such legislation is that\nit would give the Government leverage over universities to prevent\nstudents from coming here to study\nthings like nuclear physics because\nof their political beliefs or affiliations and nationality. Is it right for\na university to be forced to restrict\nadmission of students on that basis?\nHow does this fit with academic\nfreedom?\nAll this things trouble me. That\u2019s\nnot to say that I wouldn\u2019t agree to\nany of them in particular. But the\noverall impact and culture they create is worrying. as is their wider\nimplications. Our need for security\nis real, yet we should not be sacrificing our freedom. There are no quick\nanswers, but I look forward to the\ndebate.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\n\n"

Actually,\nwhen it comes to smoking,\nthe Government has decided\nto go beyond providing handy\ntips on cigarette packets. The\ndramatic measures suggested make this part of the paper\nstand well out from the rest.\nDuetoscientificevidenceon\nthe dangers of second-hand\nsmoke, workplaces and most\npublic places will be smoke-free by 2008. Exceptions have\nbeen made for pubs that do\nnot serve \u2018prepared\u2019 food, and\nprivate members clubs where\nthe membership wish to allow\nsmoking.\nThe Government\u2019s announcement of its intention\nto ban smoking is the latest in a slow-burning battle that science seemed to\nhave wrapped up long ago.\nThe dangers of smoking to\nthe smoker, particularly the\ngreatly increased risk of lung\ncancer, have been highlighted\nby various researchers for\naround 50 years. Evidence of\nthe dangers of passive smoking has been slower to arrive.\nA major reason for this is\nthe difficulty of such studies,\nbecausesomanyotherfactors\nmust be taken into account.\nThere is much complexity in\nthe science behind hard-hit-ting headlines like \u201cpassive\nsmoking kills one bar worker\na week\u201d. This study was carried out here at Imperial by\nKonrad Jamrozik, who was a\nprofessor of primary care epidemiology until earlier this\nyear. He used two massive\ndatasets to make estimates\nof the number of deaths in\nthe UK each year from passive smoking. Records of\nall deaths in 2002 from lung\ncancer, ischaemic heart disease and stroke in Britons\nunder 65, and on exposure to\nsecond-hand smoke at home\nand work, were compared.\nPrevious studies provided\ninformation on the risks of disease faced by smokers, nonsmokers and those exposed\nto other people\u2019s smoke.\nCombining these sets of data\nand subsequent calculations\ngave Jamrozik those dramatic figures \u2013 3600 deaths a year\ncaused by passive smoking,\n700 due to workplace smoke,\n49 of them in hospitality.\nTaken as a whole, epidemiological work on the risks of\npassive smoking is convinc-ing. But the way that the science of these studies works is\nfound unconvincing by many\nwhen presented in the media.\nSuch work is (easily) criticised for layering together\nmultiple \u2018estimates\u2019 of risk.\nPressure groups against a\ncrackdown on smoking quickly point this out, dismissing\nanything so tentative as an\nestimate and balking at the\nmention of \u2018calculations\u2019 or\n\u2018projections\u2019. \u201cShow us concrete proof that passive smoking has these effects,\u201d they\ndemand. Unfortunately, none\nis likely to materialise unless\nlarge numbers of people can\nbe persuaded to sit in carefully controlled but smoky\nconditions for long periods.\nThe reception given to\nclaims about risks associated with passive smoking is a\ngood example of the problems\nwith presenting research that\nproduces \u2018risk factors\u2019. Such\nstudies are typically presented in the press as information upon which readers\nare expected to act to reduce\ntheir risk. Unfortunately it\u2019s\ndifficult to relate to these per-centages, and an examination\nat how they are produced by\nscientists reveals methodology that can appear to be some\nway removed from \u2018fact\u2019.\nOne of the most interesting\nfeatures of the debate that\ncontinues to trail in the wake\nof the decisions on smoking\nhas been the way that the\nscientific side, with all its\npercentages, has been down-played. The focus has instead\nbeen on issues of choice and\nliberty. Are smokers entitled\nto smoke where and when\nthey like? Are others entitled\nto go where they like and not\nencounter a smoky fog?\nThe dramatic figures provided by the work of Konrad\nJamrozik and others have\nrarely been invoked; more\nfrequently discussion is about\nwhether we live in a nanny\nstate. From the point of view\nof the science, this seems\nstrange; shouldn\u2019t the discussion focus on the fact that\nsmokers are damaging the\nhealth of those around them?\nUsing traffic lights to change the way you eat\nThe new legislation will try to tackle the obesity epidemic as well as other health issues.\nRosie Taylor explains how the Government plans to make the fat boys and girls slim\nOn 16 November, the Health\nSecretary John Reid published Choosing Health, the\nGovernment\u2019s public health\nWhite Paper.\nThe document sets out the\nGovernment\u2019s plans to make\nit easier for people to change\ntheir lifestyle so they eat\nmore healthily, exercise more\nand smoke less. It also sets\nout moves to improve sexual\nhealth, encourage sensible\ndrinking and improve mental\nwellbeing.\nThe strategies for action\nare, says the Government,\nbased on the principles of\ninformed choice, personalised\nservices and collaboration\nbetween the Government, the\nNHS, industry and wider soci-ety. It identifies how, given\nbetter information and sup-port, people can be empowered to make healthy lifestyle\nchoices.\nWhen it comes to the health\nof children, the Government\nfeels that it has a special\nresponsibility, along with families and schools. So in addition to better information and\nsupport, it has set out new\nstandards for food in schools,\npromotion of physical activity\nand education on nutrition.\nThe changes aim to place\nhealth promotion at the heart\nof the NHS. This involves a\nbig change in attitude, among\nNHS staff and the public, in\nhelping people choose healthier lifestyles and giving them\ngreater control over their\nhealth.\nSince treating ill health\nrelated to poor diet costs the\nNHS an estimated \u00a34bn each\nyear, this white paper was\nno doubt inspired as much\nby fears about the costs to\nthe NHS of current trends\nin ill health, highlighted in\nthe Treasury-commissioned\nWanless report earlier this\nyear, as by any desire to\nimprove health for its own\nsake.\nA cornerstone in facilitating the public to make\nhealthier food choices is the\nGovernment\u2019s plans to intro-duce, by mid-2005, a colour-coded system of food label-ling. Presently, The Foods\nStandards Agency (FSA) is\ndeveloping a \u2018traffic light system\u2019 to code food.\nGill Fine, Director of\nConsumer Choice and\nDietary Health at the FSA,\nsaid: \u201cPeople have told us\nthey want to make healthier\nfood choices and that they\nwould welcome signposting\nto help them.\u201d\nThis labelling system will\nbuild on the nutrient criteria\nfor the \u20185 A DAY\u2019 logo already\nin use. The \u20185 A DAY\u2019 logo system will be developed further\nas the Government works\nwith retailers, caterers, manufacturers and producers to\npromote the \u2018five portions or\nfruit and vegetables a day\u2019\nmessage. The average intake\nof fruit and vegetables in the\nUK is just 2.8 portions a day,\nwell below the recommended\nintake. Consuming at least\nfive portions of fruit and\nvegetables a day can reduce\nthe risk from heart disease,\nstroke and cancer by up to\n20%.\nThe Government also plans\nto introduce clear labelling\nof the nutritional content of\nfood, and the FSA has commissioned research to develop a scheme to categorise\nfoods on the basis of the nutrients they contain.\nThe Government, in collaboration with the food industry,\naims to identify methods to\nreduce levels of salt, added\nsugars and fat, initially on a\nvoluntary basis. These areas\nare being targeted in light\nof the strong evidence on\ntheir damaging effects on\nhealth. An estimated one in\nthree deaths from cancer and\ncoronary heart disease are\nattributable to poor diet. A\nreduction in the salt intake of\nthe population from the current average of 9g to 6g per\nday would result in an estimated reduced incidence of\ncoronary heart disease by 6%,\nstroke by 15%, and high blood\npressure by 17%. Reducing\nfat intake, particularly saturated fat, can help lower the\nrisk of coronary heart disease\nand some cancers.\nNew \u2018NHS health trainers\u2019\nwho have been dubbed \u2018NHS\nlifestyle coaches\u2019, will be\nintroduced in 2006 to advise\nanyone who wants to live\na more healthy life. These\ntrainers will be equipped to\nprovide individualised advice\non a range of aspects including how people can become\nmore active. The Government\nhopes that by creating thousands more miles of cycle\npaths, organising walking initiatives and easing access to\nsports facilities, the trend of\ndramatically decreasing rates\nof physical activity in the last\n25 years will be reversed as\npeople become more active.\nThe Government has\nalso suggested a voluntary\nrestriction on all advertising,\npromotion and sponsorship of\nunhealthy foods and drinks\nbefore 9pm, to minimise\nchildren\u2019s exposure to these\ninfluences.\nSocial inequalities in health\nexist, with those in lower\nsocial classes eating around\nhalf the fruit and vegetables\nof people from professional\ngroups, and higher levels of\nobesity in the lower social\nclasses. This social inequality underlies almost all public health concerns, and the\nGovernment plans to implement a range of measures to\ntackle these.\nAdditional funding will be\ngiven to Primary Care Trusts\n(PCTs) in deprived areas to\ntackle health inequalities\nand improve health. This will\ninvolve joint action by local\nauthorities with business\nand voluntary groups. From\n2006, people living in deprived\nareas will be encouraged to\nuse a \u2018personal health kit\u2019\nwith support from their doctor\nand health trainer to improve\ntheir health.\nSmoking: every person\u2019s right or a sociopathic addiction?\n\u201cThe changes aim to\nput health promotion at\nthe heart of the NHS\u201d\n\u201cThe government\u2019s\nannouncement... is the\nlatest in a slow-burning\nbattle that science\nseemed to have\nwrapped up long ago\u201d\nA new traffic light system of food labelling is set to change\nour dietary habits and the way we look at food\n\n"
