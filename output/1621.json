I can only\nspeak for me though, so I\nwill. It\u2019s my editorial, mate. When I\nwoke up on New Year\u2019s Day 2015,\nI didn\u2019t think I would still be at\nImperial by the end of it. I was due\nto graduate, I certainly wasn\u2019t up\nfor further, further education, and I\nassumed I\u2019d be spending Christmas\n2015 on a houseboat in Berlin, just\nworking on my poetry or trying to\nlearn to code.\nAlas, I am not on a boat. I\u2019m not\nin Berlin (most of the time). I\u2019m sat\nin a subterranean office in Beit \u2013 a\nhall I was not cool enough to get\na room at in first year \u2013 living my\nactual dream. I get paid to write a\nnewspaper for you lot.\nThere\u2019s a theme at Imperial. We\narrive, we want to get the best out of\nour time here, so we put our heads\ndown and work solidly for four\nyears.We are occasionally distracted\nby general elections, rugby clubs\nor giant desks, but apart from\nthat, we don\u2019t pay much attention.\nAnd FELIX is as guilty as anyone\nA word from the Editor\nEditor-in-Chief\nGrace Rahman\nComment Editors\nTessa Davey and Vivien\nHadlow\nScience Editors\nJane Courtnell and Lef\nApostolakis\nArts Editors\nIndira Malik, Jingjie Cheng\nand Max Falkenberg\nMusic Editor\nCale Tilford\nFilm Editor\nFred Fyles\nWelfare Editor\nNoor Mulheron\nSports Editor\nJosh O\u2019Donnell\nPuzzles Editors\nHamish Beck and Roxana\nRadu\nFood Editor\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nCopy Editors\nHenry Lloyd-Laney, James\nBates, Tessa Davey and\nFrancesca Siracusa\nCover art by Adrian\nLaMoury\nNews\nComment\nScience\nArts\nPhoenix\nMusic\nFilm\nGames\nFood\nWelfare\nPuzzles\nHangman\nSport\n3\n5\n7\n11\n15\n44\n46\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\nfor contributing to this narrative.\nImperial students do a tonne of\nstuff.

I wish to respond to\nthat article.\nIagreewiththeauthor\u2019scontention\nthat, prima facie, some of the\npresident\u2019s views are incendiary and\nalienating. At Imperial College we\nhave much to appreciate, especially\nthe diversity of our student body.\nFacile and defamatory comments\nabout the beliefs of fellow students\nnot only causes harm to the targeted\nindividual(s), but divides and\ndegrades the rich social tapestry\nendowed upon us by this learned\ninstitution. In this day and age, it is\ntoo easy to disseminate thoughtless,\nharmful comments via the Internet,\nin this case blanket accusations of\ntreason against patriotic Scots.\nWhilst one must decry ill-judged\ncomments whenever they appear,\nI believe that the author has also\ncommitted errors of judgement.It is\nfair to question the impartiality of\nthe concerned individual given their\npast comments, especially when\nsuch comments would likely offend\nseveral students. Nevertheless, the\nauthor implies that this individual\nis unqualified to perform her\nduties as president on the basis of\nher political beliefs. I have seen no\nevidence to support this insinuation;\nthe overwhelming majority of\ntweets by the account in question\npromotes student engagement,\ncollege outreach programs and\ndiversity, no less than what one\nwould expect. It seems that the\nauthor wishes to decry an elitist vibe\nin the president and hence sets her\nup as an anathema of the student\nbody. In this country it is common\nto succumb to class-based prejudice;\na rational person would not resort\nto judging someone for their\nsocioeconomic status. Such conduct\nis most primitive and unscientific,\nundeserving of Imperial\u2019s reputation\nas a center of learning.\nTo add insult to injury, the\nauthor concludes by lambasting\nImperial\u2019s student population for\npolitical stupor, subtly alluding\nto the well-worn jibe of ICL\ninsulting UCL. Evidently Imperial\nis less politically-active than other\nuniversities, for the simple reason\nthat we are a technically-oriented\ninstitution. Nevertheless, it is false\nto say that we are apathetic about\nour welfare and self-governance.\nWe care deeply. It\u2019s just that at\nthe moment we\u2019re simply too busy\nwith our coursework and studies to\nwade into the bewildering world of\nactivism, rallies and power politics.\nWe shouldn\u2019t let petty, polarizing\nand introspective distractions\nclutter our media. We should\nhowever be discussing thorny\nand uncomfortable issues, such\nas addressing gender imbalances,\nliving conditions and profligacy\nwith our dear tuition fees. FELIX\u2019s\ninvestigations of these issues\nand attempts to bring greater\ntransparency to the autocracy\nimposed on us are much appreciated.\nKind regards,\nDaniel Williams\n\n"

Has the prestigious\naward, no stranger to controversy,\nfinally jumped the shark in the most\nspectacular style possible?\nThe truth is, the group of\n20-somethings, none of whom are\neven fully qualified as architects,\nhave created in the Granby Four\nStreets Projects, work that is head\nand shoulder above the rest of their\ncompetition.\nThe other nominees included,\nNicole Wermers. Her installation\nInfrastruktur, featured vintage fur\ncoats stitched onto steel designer\nchairs. It is an installation so devoid\nof real concept or power of execution\nthat to muster any emotion other\nthan abject apathy towards it\nrequires Herculean power of will.\nBonnie Camplin\u2019s work, a room\nfilled with television screens blaring\nout amateur videos from conspiracy\ntheorists, was more engaging than\nWermer\u2019s, that is to say, it barely\nlimped over the ridiculously low\nbar that Wermer had set. Janice\nKerbal shunned the visual to favour\na cacophony of noise and discordant\nvoices, composing an operatic\nperformance of a series of mishaps\nthat occur to the fictional, hapless\nDoug.\nIn order to compose the pieces,\nshe undertook extensive training\nin musical theory. Theoretically\nfoolproof it may have been, but by\nall accounts the practical version left\nmuch to be desired. Each of these\nartists produced highly academic\nwork, work that few outside the\nrarefied world of the upper echelons\nof art can relate to, work that is\nultimately rendered cold and sterile\ncompared to that of Assemble\u2019s.\nThe group undertook the urban\nregeneration of a series of terraced\nhouses in Toxteth, Liverpool.\nThe four streets that make up the\nGranby neighbourhood had been\nleft to rot since the riots in the area\nin the 1980s. The neighbourhood,\nlarge enough to house 200, now\nonly contains 70 residents.\nUntil ten years ago, the area was\nakin to a ghost town. Council after\ncouncil had promised to turn the\nsituation around but nothing had\never been accomplished. Finally,\nthe residents took matters into\ntheir own hands and formed The\nGranby Four Streets Community\nLand Trust and began to paint the\nabandoned houses, plant the streets,\nand run a community market to\nbreathe life back into the derelict\nstreets.\nAssemble have taken this further,\nand have dared to dream bigger.\nThey have offered their expertise\nin renovating unusual spaces to the\nresidents to renovate the houses\nwith gathered materials. Assemble\u2019s\nprevious work includes creating a\npop-up cinema from an abandoned\npetrol station, and creating a public\narts space under a motorway\nin North London. These have\nbeen fairytale like constructions,\nbeautiful, surreal spaces that leave a\nlasting impression, Assemble have\nbuilt something of a reputation\nof turning all they touch to gold;\ntheir HQ at Yardhouse, once just\nanother part of a grey and tired\nlooking set of factories in the East\nEnd, has now been transformed\ninto a building covered in ice cream\ncoloured concrete tile; something of\na Instagram mecca.\nThe renovated Granby Four\nStreets houses have the same magic\nabout them; where a floor was\nmissing, they have simply created\na double height space. As a result,\nunexpected spaces have sprung up:\ntowering ceilings, cathedral like\nhallways. The project has been an\nexercise in creative thinking and\nambitious vision.\nIt\u2019s not just about the eye candy\nthough, in Granby Four Streets,\nAssemble have created a plan for\na sustainable future. They have\nestablished the Granby workshops,\nemploying local residents to create\nhandmade home furnishings from\nscavenged materials.\nAssemble\u2019s work may not be art\nas we know it, but revolutionary\nwork rarely fits snugly in one box.\nThe Granby Four Streets Project\nhas changed real lives, and created\nsomething beautiful and lasting.\nI would be hard pressed to find a\nbetter definition of what art should\nbe.\nUnexpected,\nmagical\nspaces\nThe Cineroleum, an abandoned petrol station was transformed into a cinema by Assemble.

    "content": "20\nThe Phoenix 21 winter 2015\n8AM. Thursday 7th December. 2011.\nCold slippers, black coffee, a spritz of oil in the pan\u2014two eggs, fried sunny-side up\u2014a rustle of newspapers,\nslurp and burp. Domestic sounds once strange and foreign to my ears now easing into familiarity with the\nslow decay of time. They become no more than white noise, a quiet requiem to the stolid routine of winter\nmornings. Sometimes I\u2019m caught off guard by how abruptly my senses have deadened; bright colours are\noffset with grey, bright sounds muffled by distance. The world has become thin, overstretched\u2014like butter\nspread across too much bread. Yet I can\u2019t scrape the ash from my tongue; its burnt scent lingers on the verge\nsomewhere just out of reach, quilting my meals in a bitter lather, unmoved by even the strongest of spirits.\nAnd don\u2019t ask, because I\u2019ve tried them all. Everclear, absinthe, neutral grain, cocoroco, arak. There\u2019s no poison\nstrong enough.\nThere are nights when I feel as if my entire person is subdued, tied down by apathy, by a vague sense of loss,\nby the cosmic weight of years passing by.\nThirty three fucking years.\nEvery single one etched on my face.\nOh Tak, you would barely recognise me now. I\u2019m a poorly shaved Neanderthal with questionable sideburns.\nMy armpits exude a faintly sweet smell: damp sweat, cigarette, and a hint of something tangy and nostalgic,\nlike old wasabi. Those tarry eyes that confounded you so much have since been corrupted by a line of white\u2014a\nhalo around my irises, constricting them, confining them. My lips are dry from a simple lack of speech, their\ncorners so permanently downturned they\u2019ve become gravity\u2019s plaything. The only word I use now is the\ndeathless, interminable \u201csorry\u201d. I think I\u2019ll be saying sorry right up to my grave. Sorry, sorry, sorry.\nI don\u2019t sleep so well now. It seems this dollhouse I live in isn\u2019t built for lengthy dwelling. Its walls give me the\nvague impression of a dam caving in. I\u2019ve shrunk to fit inside; it\u2019s greedily accepted my pound of flesh and\nhungers for more, stripping me from random places\u2014the fleshy concave of my belly, pulpy rings around the\nneck, mid-thigh, buttocks.\nThese nights, Ambien is my friend. Round, pink pills with shallow notches like hieroglyphs, keeper of my\ndreamless sleep. Don\u2019t sulk; I know it\u2019s bad. Ambien is a fickle temptress. On the nights she doesn\u2019t deliver\nyou invariably appear, Takumi, drifting in between the sheets, and I don\u2019t quite know if I should be scared or\nrelieved.\n1AM. Monday 9th\nJanuary. 2012.\nI\u2019m sitting in front of a secretary\u2019s desk in a nondescript room of a nondescript building\u2014the matte, faceless\nkind you always hated. Its walls are drenched in a faded bisque, interrupted by obnoxious \u201cart\u201d prints\u2014bold\nslaps of colour across a white canvass\u2014hung in tactical locations that hit you squarely in the eye whenever you\nlook up. I keep my head bowed as I twist the business card around in my fingers: WILLIAM HUNT. A solid\nname; strong, full-bodied. Brings to mind suntans, full-fat milk, a thick bulk of muscle beneath a skimpy shirt.\nBut I digress; his full name is Dr. William Hunt. I\u2019d cut his ad out of a local paper this Christmas, his name\nblazoned in Britannic Bold across a stock photo of a woman with her head cupped in her hands. COME TALK\nIT OUT, the script screamed, WE\u2019RE HERE TO HELP. And as is that hapless end-of-year custom, I drank my\nway through two full bottles of 2009 Sauvignon blanc before thinking, fuck it! I knew you\u2019d disapprove. You\u2019d\nput on that quizzical frown and say, \u201cWhy are you paying for some thinly veiled Freudian bullshit? Are you\ncrazy?\u201d\nMaybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m so keen to try it out. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\n\u201cMr. Kaito Abe?\u201d\nThat\u2019s my cue.\nA fitting word for Dr. William Hunt might be clean. His expressions are transparent enough, lucid and open;\nhis smile seems to permeate every sinew on his face, smooth tendons buoyed up in a glorious contortion that\ncompels your lips to reply. There are no dark shadows on his face, no baggage beneath the eyes, a baby-smooth\nglabrous jaw. Yes, I know you\u2019d scoff at my description, Tak. Your first response might well be a deadpan \u201cBotox.\nBrow lift. Fillers. And that\u2019s just for starters.\u201d But let me backtrack a little. When I first entered the room I had\nto stifle a gasp that formed like a canker in my throat.\nBecause he reminded me so much of you.\nIt was really you sitting there, wasn\u2019t it? Fountain pen suspended two inches from your pad, one leg crossed over\nthe other in its usual slapdash way, your steely eyes boring into mine.\nDr. Hunt beckons me in with genuine concern. \u201cAre you alright, Mr. Abe?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cPlease take a seat.\u201d He gestures to the cup of water on the coffee table. \u201cOr would you prefer something a little\nstronger? Tea perhaps?\u201d\nA whiskey on the rocks would be nice. \u201cTea sounds great.\u201d\nHe smiles knowingly.\n\u201cSo. What\u2019s been bothering you?\u201d\nStraight to the point. Like a bullet.\n\n"

Last year we\nlanded on a comet,the creation\nof Interstellar produced the most\naccurate representation of a black\nhole to date, Pluto\u2019s beauty was\nfinally captured by New Horizons,\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\nCosmonauts at the Science Museum\nCelebrating the birth of the space age\nthere\u2019s serious talk about sending\none-way manned missions to Mars\nfurther fuelled by the discovery of\nliquid water flowing on the surface\nof the planet, space planes are\nofficially a reality and in less then a\nweek we\u2019ll be casually sending a UK\nastronaut to the ISS. No biggie.\nThe list of achievements goes\non and on, ranging from the\nunthinkable to the outright bizarre.\nYet what\u2019s truly amazing is that\nour love affair with space only\nblossomed about 60 years ago.\nIndeed, 1957 was the year that\nmarked the birth of the space age.\nOn the 4th\nof October, the Soviets\ntook the world by surprise when\nthey announced that Sputnik 1 had\nwritten history by becoming the\nfirst artificial satellite to be launched\ninto orbit around the Earth.\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 initiated\na long line of Soviet firsts, that\nincluded first human launched into\nspace,first human to spend 24 hours\nin space, first two simultaneous\nspace missions, first woman in\nspace, first three-member crew in\nspace and so on and so forth.\nThe rapid development of Soviet\nRussia\u2019s space program fostered a\nclimate of anxiety and fear on the\nother side of the world. The USA,\nweary of the potential of the new\ntechnology in warfare, intensified\nspace research entering the 20th\ncentury space race.\nAll this and more is packed in the\nCosmonauts exhibition, running at\nthe Science Museum till the 13th\nof March next year. The exhibition\ntakes visitors on a journey spanning\nover a century, introducing us to\nW\nithin the first 15\nseconds the listener\nis transported to\nouter space by the\nhighly recognisable Space Odyssey\ntheme tune accompanied by\npresenter Simon Jack, announcing\nit\u2019s 2075. \u2018Ground control to\nMajor Tom\u2019 by David Bowie is\nalso used towards the end as it\u2019s a\nsong everyone associates with outer\nspace.Transporting the listener into\nan alternate, futuristic reality creates\nthe ambiance needed in radio to\nenhance auditory images and make\nup for the lack of visual stimulation.\nSimon then asks his co-host,a robot\ncalled Emily to go into the archives\nto find these following sound-bites,\nthe forefathers of space travel, the\nmysterious mastermind behind\nthe successes of the Soviet space\nprogram, the Soviet cosmonauts \u2013\nicons like Yuri Gagarin (the original\nGaga) who filled the peoples eyes\nand dreams with stars \u2013 and much,\nmuch more.\nThe exhibition contains some\nof the era\u2019s most iconic artefacts,\nsuch as artwork inspired by our\nachievements in space exploration,\nthe actual spacecraft that took\nValentina Tershkova (first female\ncosmonaut) into space and a\nmannequin that successfully orbited\nthe Moon, to name but a few.\nIt also offers an interesting insight\non the effect of imperialism on\nresearch and innovation, as well\nas parallels between 20th\ncentury\nSoviet and modern day Russian\nimperialism and the whole political\ntension between the east and west.\nSo get your space mojo on and\nimmerse yourself in one of the\ncoolest exhibitions within a one-mile radius from college.\nNatasha Khaleeq\nWriter\nFood on Mars!\nBlurring the boundries between science and fiction through radio\nallowing the audience to travel back\nto the present.\nA clip of excited NASA\nscientists from 2015 sampling red\nromaine space lettuce through\ntheir experiment, introduces the\nmain topic of survival on Mars.\nDr Richter explains how a box\nhas been created in order to grow\nplants on our neighbouring planet\u2019s\nsurface. Of course, if astronauts are\nconsuming food then waste will be\nproduced, which Dr Lasseur from\nthe European Space Agency (ESA)\nexplains will be recycled to produce\nwater, oxygen and food, creating an\nartificial ecosystem. Plants could\nalso be grown all year round, as\ndemonstrated by Tom Webster\u2019s\ncommercial scale urban aquaponics\nprogram. Furthermore, according\nto Dr Mahmoud Solh different\nfood will be available as 150,000\nspecimens can be stored in a seed\nbank vault which could be used to\ntransport various species into space.\nAlthough astronauts will survive\nwith diverse diet, I for one wouldn\u2019t\nwant to spend the rest of my life\nas a lone wolf. For example, in the\nMartian, Matt Damon is alone,\nshowing how daunting socialising\nin space can be. However, if\nastronauts were able to cook in\nspace it would give them an Earthly\naspect keeping the communication\nalive. So, it seems like everything\nis set for interplanetary migration\nthen.

There are many\ngames, particularly when stealth\nis involved, where entirely pacifist\nplaythroughs are possible (although\nthis rarely beneficial to the player).\nUndertale gives a certain humanity\nto its enemies through humour and\ncharm. It doesn\u2019t actively encourage\nyou to spare those you encounter,\nbut I\u2019ve never felt worse murdering\nsomething digitally before.\nTobyfox\u2019s debut is a shining\ngem in an endless stream of\nunimaginative indie games and an\nindustry obsessed by open worlds.\nBy twisting JRPG mechanics, it\u2019s\na game that feels instantly familiar\nwhile still pushing the tired genre\nforward. Other than the ability\nto be merciful, Undertale will be\nremembered for its hilariously sad\nscript and fourth-wall breaking\nmechanics (this is a game which\ncould only work on PC). Even the\npresentation of the game, from the\nbeautiful Earthbound-inspired\ngraphics to the genre-spanning\nsoundtrack, is flawless.\nUndertale recognises that\nunderstanding and compassion are\nessential if we truly wish to resolve\nconflicts - a message that is all\ntoo obvious and yet so commonly\nignored.\nInstead of trivialising death, it\nmakes it a core theme of the game.\nIf Jeremy Corbyn played a single\ngame this year, this would be it.\nPhoto Credit: Nintendo\nPhoto Credit: Psyonix\nPhoto Credit: Konami\nPhoto Credit: Toby Fox\nUndertale\nMetal Gear Solid V\nSplatoon\nRocket League\nA major complaint with the\nMetal Gear Solid franchise has\nalways been that it relies too heavily\non drawn-out cutscenes and a\nnonsensical plot.\nLuckily, The Phantom Pain is\nlargely devoid of the problems that\nplagued the series\u2019 past, and as a\nresult Kojima has created arguably\nhis greatest game yet.\nThe Fulton surface-to-air recovery\nsystem introduced is probably the\nbest innovation in a gaming this\nyear. Take someone (or something)\nout non-lethally and you can attach\na balloon to their back to send them\nto Mother Base, the central hub of\nyour operations.\nWhether in Afghanistan or\nAngola-Zaire, it\u2019s incredibly\nsatisfying to quietly take out an\nentire outpost of soldiers and then\nhave them all join your army as\nresearchers, medics or foot soldiers.\nWith each extra recruit, you really\nfeel like you\u2019re making progress.\nThis is one of the many ways the\nworld feels incredibly reactive; each\nsmall decision you make causes\na ripple, large or small. You can\napproach each mission (or side-mission) in seemingly infinite ways.\nI can\u2019t think of a single time where\nI felt restricted by the tools available\nto me, which is often the case even\nin games labelled as open world\nsandboxes.\nThe Phantom Pain is what all\nfuture open-world games should\naspire to be: responsive, lifelike, and\nbeautifully rendered. Kojima, take a\nbow.\nNintendo created one of the\ngreatest first-person shooters of all\ntime when they released Metroid\nPrime for the GameCube in 2002.\nHowever, since then people have\nrarely associated Nintendo with\nthe genre. In 2015, with Splatoon\nthey innovate yet again, producing a\nthird-person shooter that attempts\nto redefine what a competitive\nshooter can be.\nThere is no death in Splatoon,only\nthe sudden explosion into a pile of\nink.The aim of the game is to cover\nas much of the map in your team\u2019s\ncolour. So, rather than being a game\nabout taking down the opposing\nteam, it\u2019s more about taking control\nof the map.Paint a surface with your\nink and you can turn into a squid\nand swim through the map, vastly\nincreasing your speed.\nThis is certainly a game for all\nages; violence is nowhere to be\nseen. In the absence of blood there\nis nothing but paint and it\u2019s all\nthe more fun for it. Maybe other\ndevelopers should take note.\nAt first, the game\u2019s art style will\nprobably remind you of an awful\nnineties cartoon. It\u2019s Nintendo\u2019s\nweird attempt at trying to look\ncool, but it seems to have succeeded.\nSomeone\u2019s even made a whole zine\ndedicated to the fashion in the game\nand the weird half-human half-squid hybrids that you play as. The\nsoundtrack is similarly \u2018rad\u2019 and like\nall Nintendo games you\u2019ll quickly\nbe humming along.\nThe only problem is that you\u2019ll\nhave to buy a Wii U to play it.\nRocket League is the sequel to\nSupersonic Acrobatic RocketPowered Battle-Cars, a name\nwhich, while a bit of a mouthful, is\na fairly accurate description of both\ngames. It\u2019s essentially a football\ngame, but with cars. Obviously, cars\ndon\u2019t have feet so they couldn\u2019t call\nit that (although that doesn\u2019t stop\nAmericans from misusing the term).\nIt\u2019s miles better than both Fifa\nand PES, two games which have\nhad years to evolve. Somehow, as a\ncar you feel more like you\u2019re actually\nplaying football.There\u2019s a large focus\non positioning and strategy, and\nit\u2019s certainly no good to just chase\nthe ball around. To save goals you\nhave to perform almost impossible\nacrobatic maneuvers. You can\nperform all sorts of tricks thanks to\nthe rocket boosters attached to your\ncar.You can even fly if you want, but\nyou\u2019ll only embarrass yourself.\nDevelopers, Psyonix, add another\nlayer of complexity by allowing you\nto blow up your opponents if you\nram into them hard enough. So, just\nwhen you\u2019re about to score a goal\nyou can be temporarily taken out of\nthe game.\nThe thrill of speeding from one\nend of the pitch to the other is unlike\nanything I\u2019ve ever experienced in a\nsports game. If you thought Walcott\nwas fast, Rocket League will blow\nyou away. It\u2019s refreshingly fast,\nwhich often results in goals scored\nseconds after the game starts.\nThis holiday, don\u2019t ask for Fifa and\nput Rocket League on your wish list\ninstead.\nBecause I couldn\u2019t think of five\nCALE TILFORD\n\n"

Photo Credit: mirror.co.uk\nI\nn 1910,E.M.Forster described\ntrains as \u201cour gates to the\nglorious and the unknown.\nThrough them we pass out\ninto adventure and sunshine, to\nthem, alas! we return.\u201d\nHe makes our railways seem\nso romantic. There\u2019s palpable\nexcitement in his words for getting\non a train and having a wonderful\nadventure. Over a hundred years\nhave passed and our trains aren\u2019t\ngoing anywhere.\nI\u2019m writing this from just outside\nEast Croydon, stuck at a red signal,\nwhile the conductor apologises for\nthe signal failure holding us up. I\nlive in Horsham, West Sussex. It\u2019s\nan hour south of London,and I take\nthe train to Victoria and the Tube to\nSouth Kensington.\nStudying for an MSc is an\nexpensive investment and financial\nsupport is limited to career\ndevelopment loans and nonexistent scholarships. Since I have\nneither, I\u2019m self-financing my MSc\nfrom savings, part-time jobs, and\ninheritance money. The only way\nI\u2019m able to make this work is by\nliving with my parents \u2013 I\u2019d much\nrather live in London.\nAround half the trains I catch to\nLondon with Southern Rail are late\nor cancelled. According to Which?\nsurveys, Southern scored worst for\ncustomer satisfaction and 39% of\npassengers reported being late on\ntheir most recent journey. It\u2019s worth\nmentioning that official statistics\nonly record \u2018late\u2019 as 10 minutes or\nmore.\nSouthern are full of excuses:\ninsufficient staff (maybe they\u2019re\ntrying to catch the train to work),\nemergency engineering works, lines\nblocked by broken-down trains, and\neven signalling failures \u2013 apparently\noperating a series of lights defies\nengineers\u2019 best efforts.\nThere are legitimate reasons too.\nExtreme weather (I\u2019m not talking a\ndusting of snow or leaves) such as\nthe flooding occurring in Cumbria,\nand people who sadly take their\nlives on the railway lines (this isn\u2019t\nas unusual as you might expect) are\nunavoidable.\nMost problems, however, are\ndown to incompetence of rail\ncompanies themselves. I pay \u00a328\nevery time I go to London (with\nmy one-third railcard discount). It\u2019s\na lot of money to me and probably\none of the least enjoyable ways of\nspending it. It\u2019s hard to see where\nmy money goes when I\u2019m crammed\ninto a carriage with thousands of\nother miserable-looking commuters\non a broken-down train.\nI\u2019ve been late for lectures, missed\nappointments for my Imperial\ninternship, and been late for social\nfunctions, meetings and extra\ncurricular activities I\u2019m involved\nin \u2013 all due to incompetent rail\noperators.\nI\u2019ve spent more than one night\nat Gatwick Airport. Once, I cut\nshort a holiday in the west country\nto attend a job interview. My First\nGreat Western train from Taunton\nended up stuck behind a slow\nstopping service all the way to\nLondon, I missed the last train to\nHorsham (though I should have\narrived in plenty of time to catch\nmuch earlier trains), and could only\nget as far south as Gatwick.\nI hung around the terminal\nbuilding all night attempting to get\nsome sleep before buying another\nticket, catching the first morning\ntrain home to shower, change and\neat, then catching another train to\nmy job interview (ironically, at the\nairport). I was exhausted and didn\u2019t\nget the job.\nI\u2019ve never received a refund.\nbecause it\u2019s a complicated pain, and\noperators don\u2019t issue refunds unless\nthe train is either cancelled or more\nthan 30 minutes late. I once applied\nfor a refund and was refused because\nSouthern said it wasn\u2019t clear which\ntrain I was trying to take, so they\ncouldn\u2019t ascertain if I was telling\nthe truth. I\u2019ve not bothered since,\nthough I must be owed hundreds of\npounds.\nThe cost to me and everyone else\nwho commutes is more than just\nthe ticket price. I spend \u00a39000\non tuition fees, and I travel up to\nLondon three or four times a week.\nI worked out that I have roughly\n7.5 hours of contact time with my\nlecturers each week. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that\nI am paying approximately 33p for\nevery minute of my education.\nFor every minute I am late, I am\nwasting money. Thirty-three pence\nmay not sound like much, but over a\nyear, it adds up.\nI contacted Southern with my\nconcerns, and have not been\ndignified with a response. I\u2019ve\ntweeted them multiple times to no\navail. Their arrogance and lack of\nconsideration for the people who\npay their salaries (and substantial\nbonuses) is astounding. They know\nthey can get away with operating\na shoddy service. While my rail\nfares are expensive, they\u2019re cheaper\nthan renting in London. The only\nrealistic way of getting to London is\nthe train, but there\u2019s no competition\n\u2013 we can\u2019t boycott the train as we\nmight with other companies. We\nhave no option but to keep paying\nextortionate sums of money for\nsubstandard service.\nI have several part-time jobs and\nspent four years employed as a\nteacher before coming to Imperial.\nFor most professions, punctuality\nand organisation are essential. If we\ndon\u2019t deliver our services on time,we\ndon\u2019t get paid \u2013 simple as that.We\u2019re\nalso likely to get sacked. When I\nbuy a train ticket, I should expect to\nreceive the service as advertised by\nthe timetables.\nTheConservativeMPforHorsham,\nJeremy Quin, said this as part of\nhis Action on Railways campaign:\n\u201cThere are thousands of people\n[\u2026] for whom a regular, reliable\nrail service is absolutely critical.\nDue to [\u2026] poor performance\nby Southern and Network Rail,\nrail users have not been receiving\nthe service they deserve or should\nexpect. Cancellations, timetable\nchanges, poor communication and\ninadequate compensation have all\nled to significant frustration.\u201d\nWhile the Government has frozen\nfares, this doesn\u2019t \u2018compensate\nfor poor performance\u2019. Rail\nMinister Clare Perry is said to be\naddressing these problems. I remain\nunconvinced anything will change.\nI\u2019m still waiting outside East\nCroydon, wishing I possessed E M\nForster\u2019s optimism.\nApparently\noperating\na series of\nlights defies\nengineers\u2019\nbest efforts\nFor every\nminute I\nam late, I\nam wasting\nmoney\n\n"

Maybe it\u2019s because your parents lied to you\nVivien Hadlow\nComment Editor\nWhatever happened to stranger danger? Photo Credit: Huffington Post\nE\nvery year, a strange\nphenomenon occurs:\ntrees are decorated, gifts\nare exchanged, and the\nworld decides that it is again time\nto deceive millions upon millions of\nimpressionable children.\nWhenever someone discovers\nthat I\u2019ve never believed in Santa,\nthe customary reaction is to lament\nmy poor, deprived childhood, which\nmust have been so dull without the\nmagic of Father Christmas.It is as if\nI had revealed that my parents used\nto give me a lump of coal, a slice of\nbread and lock me away in my room\nfor the day. In fact, I was positively\nspoiled at Christmas; I got to\nspend time with my whole family,\nmake and eat delicious food, and\nexchange gifts with people I love,\nthings which I used to get excited\nfor and still do, because none of\nthose things was pulled out from\nunder my feet when I discovered it\nwasn\u2019t real.\nFew sentences inspire more\nsorrow in me than \u201cI don\u2019t get\nexcited for Christmas any more.\u201d\nIt is a sentence you hear from more\nand more people growing up, and is\ninvariably, in my experience, said by\npeople who used to believe in Santa.\nThis is no coincidence \u2013 when most\nof your excitement for a festive day\nstems from your absolute belief that\na quaint old man with a beard will\nmiraculously appear in your home\nand leave whatever you wish for\nat the foot of your bed, it is little\nwonder that when the illusion is\nkilled, so is most of your buzz.\nOn a more sinister level, the belief\n(or lack thereof) in Santa creates a\nweird power dynamic between older\nand younger children, especially\nsiblings. Having never believed,\nI can\u2019t be sure, but I imagine that\nmost children don\u2019t find the truth\nin a \u201cthe talk\u201d-esque chat with their\nparents. It could be a school friend\nwho found out early accidentally\nblurting out the harsh reality \u2013\nor worse, it could be deliberately\nrevealed in spite. Either way, it is an\nembarrassing and awkward moment\nwhich wouldn\u2019t have to be endured\nif people stopped lying to children\nand let them enjoy the story of\nFather Christmas for what it is \u2013 a\nstory.\nThese practical considerations\naside, the crux of the matter is\nthat children shouldn\u2019t be lied to\nunnecessarily. I don\u2019t want my\nchildren to grow up not trusting\nwhat I say, and although leading\nkids to believe that Santa is real\nis seemingly innocuous, it is still a\nlie. It still teaches them that their\nparents don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to\ntell them the truth.\nThatcherites of the world, unite!\nPolitical diversity is to be\ncherished, not shouted down as\n\u201cproblematic\u201d\nChristopher Whitehouse\nWriter\nL\nast week, FELIX Music\nEditor, Cale Tilford,\ncomplained that our\nUnion President, Lucinda\nSandon-Allum, had expressed\nadmiration for Margaret Thatcher.\nHe went as far as to say that her\ncomments were \u201cproblematic\u201d and\ndisplayed \u201c\u2026a complete lack of\nempathy\u201d.\nThatcher is not some fringe\ncharacter like Donald Trump or\nStalin; the British people elected\nher three times in a row. It\u2019s easy\nto forget how low Britain had\nsunk: reduced to working by\ncandlelight and three-day weeks by\ncynical union leaders who held the\nBritish economy hostage. We were\nconsidered so weak that a third-rate\nmilitary junta in Buenos Aires dared\nto invade sovereign British soil and\nsubjugate British citizens. Thatcher\ndefeated both through sheer force\nof will, and the world took notice;\nit was the Russians who christened\nher the \u201cIron Lady\u201d.\nThatcher took a sledgehammer to a\npost-war consensus that had existed\nfor 25 years. Her legacy is divisive\nbut undoubtedly revolutionary. She\nmay have been an enemy of the\nminers, but for the aspiring middle\nclasses who kept returning her to\nDowning Street, she was something\nof a saviour.To get there, she fought\nher way to the top of the ultimate\nOld Boys Club, flattening any poor\nbastard who stood in her way. She\nwas Britain\u2019s only ever female Prime\nMinister and probably the most\npowerful woman in our nation\u2019s\nhistory. Why shouldn\u2019t she inspire\npolitically-minded women today?\nTilford later writes with regret:\n\u201cIf a sabb at any other university\ndescribed Thatcher in the same\nway there would be a wild uproar\u2026\nsometimes I wish I\u2019d gone to UCL.\u201d\nThat\u2019s almost certainly true. A\nnew wave of small minded,left wing\nintolerance has infected campuses\nall across the UK and US.\nAt Yale, a professor who gently\nquestioned involving the university\nto pass judgement on \u201coffensive\u201d\nHalloween costumes was subjected\nto the most horrible invective, and\nhas resigned from her position. At\nOxford, a debate on abortion was\ncancelled, because both speakers\nbeing male was considered\n\u201cproblematic\u201d. At UCL, the Union\nsaw fit to ban the Nietzsche club.\nOnly non-problematic philosophy\nhere, kids! On campuses all across\nthe country, pro-Israel students face\nwidespread hostility and disruption\nfrom both other student groups and\ntheir academics. Indeed, the NUS\n(with whom we are thankfully no\nlonger affiliated) voted to boycott\nIsrael, yet failed to pass a motion\ncondemning ISIS.\nWhen these groups seek to silence\nor punish other opinions, they do\nit by weaponising the language of\nthe victim. Assert that something\nis \u201cproblematic\u201d or demand a \u201csafespace\u201d,and there is no further debate\nnecessary, just skip straight to SUapproved silencing or shaming.This\nis a terrible trend, and will stunt the\nintellectual development of a whole\ngeneration of students.\nWe should appreciate the political\nenvironment here at Imperial, a\nrare oasis of sanity surrounded by\nhysterical student activism where\nstudents of all political persuasions\nfeel free to express their views, but\ngenerally can\u2019t be bothered because\nthey have too much work to be\ngetting on with.\nImperial, a\nrare oasis\nof sanity\nsurrounded\nby hysterical\nstudent\nactivism\n\n"

After suffering a\ndefeat against this very team the\nprevious weekend, the Immortals\nwere desperate to turn their season\naround, but it wasn\u2019t enough. The\ngame ended with a disappointing\nresult of 37-0 to the Hurricanes.\nThe first quarter started out\nstrong as the defence took to the\nfield. Run and pass plays were\nshut down effectively, and with\nthe help of multiple false starts\nfrom the opposing team the game\nwas looking positive. Offence also\ncame out strong, with Emanuel \u2018is\ngoing fishing\u2019 Olagbaju bulldozing\nthrough their defensive lines.\nHowever, our recurring issue of\npass protection resulted in a couple\nof sacks on our quarterback. The\nsecond quarter was a tough time\nfor the offensive team, as we weren\u2019t\nable to earn many much-needed first\ndowns to advance downfield. The\ndefence nevertheless were firing,\nwith Rayane \u2018tie-red\u2019 Jackson flying\nall over the field making massive\ntackles, supported by the rest of the\nfront seven flowing heavy to the\nball and our defensive backs being\nable to stop catches downfield.\nWith one minute left in the first\nhalf, Emanuel Olagbaju once again\nbulleted through their defensive\nlines, gaining significant yards.\nThe second half seemed like\na different game for the offence\noverall. With the help of our\noffensive linemen, we were able to\nopen up a gap for our running back,\nEmanuel, which then proceeded\nto tear through their defense. At\none point, he was dragging one of\nthe Hurricane\u2019s players with him\nas he was sprinting downfield \u2013 a\nnightmarish flashback to training\nfor \u2018Spewy\u2019 Will Coidan. Reese\n\u2018Killem\u2019 also turned on his wheels\nand sprinted downfield with the\nball as if he were, for some reason,\nlighter than he was a few days ago.\nA special mention to David \u2018reckons\nhe can truck Spewy\u2019Rovick, coming\non for the first time this season as\nour quarterback. Defensively, we\nwere consistent and executed our\nassignments really well.\nYet another disappointing day\nfor the Immortals, however, this\nseason has not ended yet, and with\nthe uncertainty of the premiership\nleague this year, it is definitely not\ntoo late to turn our season around.\nWe would like to thank everyone\non our sideline who came down to\nsupport us at Hertfordshire and\nwe hope they return this Sunday\nwhen we face the newly-promoted\nKingston Cougars on their grounds.\nAre they queuing?

Having lost\nagainst them by very few points in\nour first game, we were all excited\nand motivated to win this match!\nUpon receiving our new\nImperialGirlsCan warm-up shirts,\nwe witnessed our Imperial Men\u2019s 2nd\nbasketball team, who are defending\nthe 1st\nrank in their division,\nconfidently beat West London.\nThen it was time for us to compete.\nEast London came to Heston\nSports Centre with a reduced\nsquad, and we used the advantages\nthat this gave us within the first few\nseconds of starting the match. We\nstarted with a 14-0 run in the first\nfew minutes of the game \u2013 this gave\nus great momentum to execute our\ngame strategy! All game we kept\nup defensive pressure, rotated all\nour players regularly and ended up\nfinishing the first half with a lead of\n44-11.\nThe second half continued just as\nsuccessfully: we started with a 12-0\nrun in the first three minutes, and\nthe score kept going up as the girls\nfrom East London became more\nand more tired. Just seconds before\nthe end of the game the score was\n99-20, but then Kylie (eight points)\nfinished with a buzzer beater and\ngot us into three digits!\nAs if this wasn\u2019t enough reason\nto celebrate, we also showed a great\nteam performance \u2013 five of our\neleven girls scored double-digits:\nOlga (22), Danielle (21), Alina (15),\nSophia (13) and Jenny (10).\nWith this win we\u2019re finishing the\ncalendar year as 2nd\nplace in division\n1A, a great position to start into\nthe second half of the season. But\nnot only the Women\u2019s basketball\nteam had an excellent first half of\nthe season: Our undefeated Men\u2019s\n1st\nteam and the Men\u2019s 2nd\nteam are\nboth top in their league and have\nhigh ambitions to get promoted.\nSo keep your fingers crossed,\nand stop by some time to see our\nthree teams compete in Ethos and\nHeston next term!\nThe t-shirts swung the match.

Soon, University\nshall be finished for the\nterm, and we will all\nbe facing the holidays. Between\nrelatives, revision, and exhaustion\nfrom the final weeks of term, now\nis the time of year that can end up\nmore stressful than enjoyable. So\nwhatever your situation,be it visiting\nhome or staying in London over the\nwinter break, remember that you are\nallowed to take some time out for\nyourself. So here are some seasonal\nself-care ideas to get you through\nthe holiday!\nMint candy cane hot\nchocolate:\nIngredients:\n2 tablespoons cocoa powder\n1-2 tablespoons of sugar (to taste)\n~1 cup of milk/soy milk/almond\nmilk\n2-3 drops peppermint essential oil\n1 candy cane\nOptional:\nWhipped cream\nCrushed candy cane\nPour a little milk, the cocoa and\nsugar into a saucepan and mix to a\npaste. Then add the rest of the milk\nand heat it over the saucepan until\nsufficiently hot. Add a few drops of\npeppermint essential oil. Stir the\nmixture and then pour into your\nmug of choice.\nIf you like, you can now add\nwhipped cream to the top and\nsprinkle crushed candy cane on top.\nFinally, stir with the candy cane\nand enjoy!\nOrange pomander\ndecoration:\n2 oranges\n1 handful of cloves\n6-8 rolls of cinnamon\n1 red ribbon\n1 needle\nsome thread\nTake one orange and cut it into\nslices.Baketheseintheovenonalow\nheat until they dry out. Meanwhile,\ntie the ribbon firmly around the\nsecond orange, so that you can hang\nthe orange from the ribbon. Then\npoke the cinnamon end-first into\nthe orange \u2013 if piercing the skin is\nhard, poke a hole with the needle\nfirst.\nTake the needle and thread it,\nmaking sure to loop the thread\nseveral times so it is strong enough\nto hang the orange and spices on\nit. Then alternate the dried orange\nslices with rolls of cinnamon,\nstringing them on the thread. Tie\noff the thread in a loop at the top\nand then tie the other end of the\nthread to the ribbon. Finally, hang\nthe orange by the loop on the thread.\nDIY Christmas tree:\n1 piece of card (A4 or A3\ndepending on how large you want\nyour \u2018tree\u2019)\nSeveral sheets of tissue paper in\ngreen, brown, red and yellow (and\nany other desired colours)\n1 hole-punch (if desired)\nScissors\nGlue\n1 string of fairy lights\nSellotape\nFirst, draw the outline of a\nChristmas tree on your card \u2013\nremember to include the trunk and\nbase of the tree! Now cut out the tree\nand either hole-punch or cut holes\nin the tree where you want the lights\nto go. Now take the tissue paper\nand scrunch it up into small balls.\nGlue these onto the tree to fill in\nthe main section of the tree, leaving\nsome gaps for any other colours you\nwant to put in to represent baubles,\nand leaving out the very top of the\ntree.Use scrunched-up brown tissue\npaper for the trunk, and use red\npaper for the base/pot for your tree.\nFinally, take one scrunched ball of\nyellow paper and stick it to the very\ntop to represent the star. Fill in any\nspaces you left with baubles. Make\nsure to avoid sticking paper directly\nover any holes you left for the fairy\nlights! Wait for it to dry.\nNow you can push the LED\nlights through the holes in the tree\nso they poke out amongst the tissue\npaper. If you need to, use sellotape\nto secure the lights in place on the\nback. Now you can prop up the tree,\nturn on the lights, and you have a\nsmall DIY Christmas tree!\nMobius strip paper\nchains:\nLots of coloured paper (red,green,\ngold and silver is suggested as\nseasonal)\nScissors\nGlue\nSeasonal Self-Care Recipes\nChristmas Cheer \u2013 Have yourself a merry little Christmas!\nCut your paper into strips. Then\ntake one strip and twist it once,\nbefore securing the ends together\nto form a Mobius strip. Take the\nnext desired colour strip and do the\nsame, but link this Mobius strip\nwith the first. Continue to make a\npaper chain that is decorative and a\nbit geeky (like all the best things!).\nFir tree diffuser:\n1 packet reed diffuser sticks\n1 small bottle\n\u00bc cup water\n\u00bc cup alcohol/vodka\n20-25 drops fir tree/pine\nessential oil\nMix the water, vodka and essential\noil together, and pour into the small\nbottle. Then rest the diffuser sticks\nin the bottle. The scent should\nwick up the reeds and diffuse into\nand around the room. Special tip:\nif you turn the reeds upside down\nregularly, the scent keeps stronger\nand fresher.\nI hope that you remember to look\nafter yourselves as well as your other\ncommitments this holiday.\nChristmas time can be difficult,\nwhether or not you are with family.\nSo remember, have a fun time and\ntreat yourself to some TLC!\n\u201cOh Christmas tree, you stand in verdant beauty!\u201d Photo Credit: Flickr\nNoor Mulheron\nWelfare Editor\nMental health\nhelplines and\nresources\nIf you are concerned about\nyour own mental health or\nthat of a loved one, there are\npeople out there you can talk\nto who can give you advice,\nor will be there to listen.\nHelplines and Online\nResources\nIf you are distressed and need\nsomeone to talk to:\nSamaritans\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\n(24 hour helpline)\nwww.samaritans.org.uk\nFor issues with anxiety:\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 09:30-17:30)\nwww.anxietyuk.org.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(Daily 10:00-22:00)\nwww.nopanic.org.uk\nFor eating disorders:\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs 13:30-16:30)\nwww.b-eat.co.uk\nFor addiction:\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\n(Daily 10:00-midnight)\nwww.ukna.org\nCollege Resources\nStudent Counselling Service\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\nEmail: counselling@ic.ac.uk\nImperial College Health\nCentre\nPhone: 020 7584 6301\nEmail: healthcentre@ic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your academic\nor personal tutor regarding\npastoral issues, especially if you\nthink your mental health might\nbe affecting your academic\nperformance.\nA warm hot chocolate makes all the\ndifference!

Whilst the album\nfeels angrier and more abrasive,\nthe overall structures and sounds\nthat Deafheaven use have changed\nvery little. Thrashing black metal\nalways seamlessly transitions to the\nuplifting melodies that band are\nfamous for. You\u2019ll need a lyric sheet\nto discern Clarke\u2019s screeching, but\nwhen you do everything begins to\nmake sense: \u201cA multiverse of fuchsia\n/ And violet surrenders to blackness\nnow.\u201d\nPhoto Credit: Deafheaven Photo Credit: Joanna Newsom Photo Credit: Bj\u00f6rk Photo Credit: Kendrick Lamar\nPhoto Credit: Jamie xx Photo Credit: Grimes Photo Credit: Sophie Photo Credit: Sufjan Stevens Photo Credit: FKA twigs\nPhoto Credit: Self Defence Family\nPhoto Credit: Julia Holter\nFor the last four years, Julia\nHolter has kept on getting closer.\nHer 2011 debut, Tragedy, was an\nabstract tone-poem, influenced\nby experimental electronica, and\ninspired by Euripides\u2019 Hippolytus;\nher 2012 follow-up,Ekstasis,seemed\nmore assured, the mumbled lyrics\nreplaced with clear-cut vocoders,\nHolter singing as if through a crystal\nmicrophone; 2013\u2019s Loud City Song\n\u2013 as well as being a highlight of that\nyear \u2013 showcased her aptitude for\njazz, with bombastic sax and drums\nkicking her baroque pop styling up\na notch. And now we have Have You\nin My Wilderness, and a sense that\nHolter has finally arrived.\nFrom the opener, \u2018Feel You\u2019, with\nits harpsichord opening line, and\npunchy drums, we are clearly made\nskittering drumming propelling the\nclarity of Holter\u2019s vocals.\nHowever, things have not all\nchanged. Holter has retained her\nincredible skill with instrumentation\n\u2013 there is never a sense that any\nelement is wasted; every blast\nof strings and piano interlude is\ncalculated with extreme precision.\nElsewhere she explores her lower\nregister, sounding like a present-day\nNico, all chilly elongated vowels.\nHer lyrical content, although more\nup front, remains as dense as ever.\n\u2018Vasquez\u2019 is named after a 19th\ncentury bandido from California,\nwhile \u2018How Long?\u2019 sees her\ninhabiting Christopher Isherwood\u2019s\ncharacter of Sally Bowles. The\nalbum closes with \u2018Have You in My\nWilderness\u2019, where Holter finished\nwith the repeated refrain, \u2018Tell me,\nwhy do I feel you running away\u2019.\nNothing could be further from the\ntruth \u2013 Have You In My Wilderness\ncements Holter\u2019s place as one of the\ngreat musicians of our generation,\nand I await with bated breath what\ncloser contact will bring.\nFRED FYLES\nHave You In My\nWilderness\nMy favourite album of the year\nhas to be Heaven Is Earth by\nSelf Defence Family. Featuring\nweird half shouted vocals, layered\njamming guitars and wonderfully\nsimple lyrics (as well as their\nconfrontational internet presence)\nthat have made Self Defence such a\nstrong force in the post-punk scene.\nThis album itself shows the full\nemotional variety that SDF are\ncapable of, with the uplifting \u2018David\nSim\u2019 cohabiting within the same\nalbum as the austere \u2018In My Defens\nSelf Me Defend,\u2019 creating a varied\ninteresting experience from start to\nfinish. My favourite track on this\nalbum is the poignant \u2018Basic Skills\u2019\nwhich shows SDF at their very best.\nThe minimalist krautrock-esque\nHeaven Is Earth\nM3LL155X\nThe Best Songs of 2015\n8. New Bermuda 7. Divers 6. Vulnicura 5. To Pimp A Butterfly\n4. In Colour 3. Art Angels 2. Product 1. Carrie & Lowell\nJoanna Newsom\u2019s fourth release\nis one of the year\u2019s most complex.\nThe multi-instrumentalist explores\ntime and love in an hour of\nfantastical musical arrangement\nwith the help of members of the\nPrague Philharmonic Orchestra.\nOn \u2018Leaving The City\u2019 she plays the\nharp and piano, interspersed with\nmetallic flutters of a marxophone\nand proggy guitar. Yet somehow her\nbreathless singing is not drowned\nout. And she wonderfully contrasts\nthis with moments where it\u2019s just\nher and the harp.\nAn album infused with the\nsounds of electronic producer Arca,\nVulnicura is heavily influenced by\nthe modern electronic scene and\nhip-hop. Like Arca\u2019s recent work,\nthere are times where the album\nis wonky, mixing stretched synths\nwith violins.Throughout the record,\nBj\u00f6rk voice seems a perfect match\nfor the venezuelan producer.\nFor some,Arca\u2019s odd sounds might\nbe alienating so Bj\u00f6rk released an\nacoustic version. It\u2019s listenable, but\nfeels oddly empty in comparison to\nthe original.\nKendrick Lamar\u2019s groundbreaking\nhip-hop album (which has seen him\nnominated for eleven Grammys)\nwas released at a time of resurgence\nfor radical Black politics in the US.\nIt\u2019s an incredibly confident record;\nhe reads lines of a poem at the\nend of each song before reciting\nthe whole thing again on \u2018Mortal\nMan.\u2019Then at the end of the album\nhe interviews Tupac by inserting\nhimself into a recording. Kendrick\nseems intent on trying to change\nthe world: \u201cAs I lead this army make\nroom for mistakes and depression.\u201d\nEarlier this year, our Editorin-Chief called the album: \u201ca\nmasterpiece in execution of a widespread appeal,boys in ironic Adidas,\nwhite people at carnival vibe.\u201d So, I\nguess it has to be on our list. Steel\npans were essential to Jamie xx\u2019s\nearly solo work. While he\u2019s come\na long way since the sublime \u2018Far\nNearer,\u2019 this steely sound still\npermeates his music like a weird,\ntranslucent Instagram filter. If you\nhaven\u2019t yet, listen to the xx-esque\n\u2018Loud Places\u2018 and \u2018Good Times,\u2019\ntwo defining songs of 2015.\nA vastly different album to Visions\nyet infinitely superior. Grimes\u2019\nmusic is now more guitar driven and\nborders on bubblegum pop. Like an\nangel from heaven,Art Angels, glows\nwith a radiance. It stays within\nthe confines of pop music but\ntranscends the tired tropes of the\nmusical industrial complex. There\u2019s\na hate track aimed at Pitchfork and\na song \u201cwritten from the perspective\nof Al Pacino.\u201dWhile it might not be\ncoherent as Visions, the songs stand\non their own: catchy, uplifting, and\naccessible.\nIntrospective and hauntingly\nbeautiful, Carrie & Lowell is a\nstark contrast to the explosive The\nAge of Adz. It\u2019s as raw as Sufjan\nStevens\u2019 early classic, Seven Swans,\nwith sparse yet vastly improved\ninstrumentation. Since his last\nalbum five years ago, Stevens has\nseen the passing of his estranged\nmother \u2013 Carrie & Lowell recounts\nthis event, but isn\u2019t defined by it.

On the\nother hand, \u2018Can\u2019t Feel My Face\u2019 is\nface-numbingly upbeat and full-on pop. Comparisons to Michael\nJackson are apt.

Friday 27th\nJanuary. 2012.\nI\u2019ve been seeing William for a few weeks now, long enough to be on first name terms.\nOn the fifth visit, he beckons me in with a wave. This is new.\n\u201cSit, sit.\u201d\nHe bumbles about, dropping sencha leaves into mugs.\n\u201cDrink, drink.\u201d\nI sip from the hot brew. Once again he assumes a predatory position in the swivel chair, legs crossed, pen\nhovering over his writing pad.\n\u201cIf I recall correctly, we were talking about your parents?\u201d\nFreudian tactics. Start with the grassroots. Somehow it always comes back to those who brought us life.\n\u201cMy father was a cell biologist. Spent more time culturing bacteria than he did with his wife and kid. Straight\ntalking no-nonsense bloke. Shy. Bit of a goatee.\u201d\n\u201cWas he good to you, growing up?\u201d\n\u201cIf you mean did he buy me Lego and model racing cars, then yes, he owned that part of the parenting\nagenda. But did he take me bowling or teach me how to fix a bust tyre? Never. And what\u2019s good supposed\nto mean? He was the kind of parent who ignores you for most of the year, and then tries to make up for it\nin the holidays. Someone who thinks that time can be bought out with money.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did he ever buy you out?\u201d\n\u201cIn the beginning, yes. What five-year-old isn\u2019t won over by shiny new things? But then I grew up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cToy trucks just didn\u2019t cut it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou mentioned Lego, trucks and racing cars. Did he ever give you any, say, gender non-conforming toys?\u201d\n\u201cLike what... Barbies?\u201d\n\u201cFor example.\u201d\nI snort. \u201cNo, he was adamant I stayed well within the XY pool. When it came to girls and boys it was black\nor white, there was no middle ground.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how did he feel about Takumi?\u201d\nBingo. The stumper.\n\u201cHe hated Takumi\u2019s guts.\u201d\nWinter fifteen is cold.\nA thin glaze of frost coats almost everything in sight\u2014lampposts, street-signs, the tips of traveller\u2019s noses.\nIt seems nobody is immune, apart from you. Are you even human?\nWe\u2019re circling the Museum of Western Art now, tracing familiar steps down to Le Corbusier\u2019s square. You\ntangle your arm in mine, the crooks of our elbows meeting at perpendiculars\u2014it\u2019s snug, a tight fit, it\u2019s like\nwe\u2019re meant to be. You\u2019re pointing at something in the far distance. You say, \u201cYou know, it used to give me\nthe creeps. But these days I just like standing there. A kind of morbid fascination. Is that weird? Aren\u2019t we\nall sinners in some way or other?\u201d\nWe walk up to it, the so-called \u201cGates of Hell\u201d. Rodin, circa 1890. Cast in bronze, it\u2019s a towering structure\nstanding six metres tall, its characters flaying and writhing at the site of hope\u2019s abandonment. There is\nRodin\u2019s Thinker in centre, his head bowed down, brow furrowed in deep, impenetrable thought.\n\u201cI want to see him in the flesh. In Paris.\u201d You smile at me. \u201cWith you.\u201d\n6PM. Saturday 4th February. 2012.\nI\u2019m almost there now, Tak.\nI\u2019m in London, the Swinging City. Not so far from Paris. Not so far from the Gates. Granted, it\u2019s not exactly\nwalking distance, more like a three-hour train ride away. But it\u2019s a milestone. Baby steps.\nPeople-watching has become my sport now. I have a birds-eye view of the streets, seeing without being\nseen. The little flyspecks on the playground below buzz with purpose, with direction. They have A and\nB points, goals and destinations, people to meet, things to do. And then there are the drifters, lone souls\nthat haunt the dusk and dawn\u2014the homeless, the drunk, the wretched and pathetic. Where do I fit in?\nMaybe I\u2019m Meursault, that stranger on the outside looking in. He stood on the outskirts of his city too,\nwith his mask of solitude, his numbness. Perhaps that\u2019s wise; to shield yourself from pain and anguish and\nhurt, you must first learn not to feel at all. The art of indifference. Of de-humanising. Strip away your fatty\nemotional layers, your hot-blooded cloak, be cold, inert.\nI cannot do it.\nThough I tried once. I stayed till early morning in a filthy nightclub, slowly gagging myself in spirits. In\ntruth I was looking for a mindless fuck, to steep in someone else\u2019s warmth for however long, however\nmeaningless\u2014to feel numb. She came onto me, pressed her body against mine, stuck her tongue down my\nthroat. What else could I do but give in? We did it a few times against the dank walls out back; it was short,\n\n"

As Guthrie\nrepeatedly says throughout the film,\n\u201cnothing endures but the land,\u201d\na line lifted from Lewis Grassic\nGibbon\u2019s classic novel, adapted\nmasterfully by Davies for the film.\nThese spoken word interludes,\nwhere we are granted access to the\nworkings of Guthrie\u2019s mind, mark\noff chapters of her sad life: the\ndeath of her mother, who poisons\nherself and her baby twins after\nfinding out she\u2019s pregnant again; the\ndebilitating stroke that leaves her\ndictatorial father bed-bound; being\nmade an orphan at the tender age of\n18; her marriage to Ewan, cut short\nby the inevitable announcement\nof the commencement of WWI.\nSunset Song hits the audience again\nand again with emotional turmoil,\nflooring us with its power.\nAs Chris Guthrie, Agyness\nDeyn is simply luminous; she is a\nrevelation. She brings to the role\na brute physical force, inhabiting\nit completely; from the pains of\nchildbirth, to the blossoming effect\nyoung love can bring, Deyn is\ncompletely present in every single\nscene. There may have been some\ncomplaints about the veracity\nof her accent (Sunset Song is set\nin northeast Scotland; Deyn is\nfrom Manchester), but for me the\npleasure of watching her on screen\ncame from the powerful nuance she\nbrought to the role; as we follow her\nover the years, there is a real sense\nof Guthrie coming out of her shell,\nand seeing her develop and flower in\nfront of our eyes is a joy to watch.\nPeter Mullan is terrifying as the\npatriarch of the Guthrie household;\nfrom the first time we see his face\nloom into view, furrowed with\nyears of anger, we know things are\nnot going to end well. The effect\nhe has on his character is palpable,\nand Mullan brings with him a\nchilly atmosphere that immediately\nsets us on edge. As Ewan, Kevin\nAgyness Deyn as Chris Guthrie, and Kevin Guthrie as Ewan, in Terence Davies\u2019 masterful Sunset Song. Photo Credit: Dean MacKenzie\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nAs Chris\nGuthrie,\nAgyness\nDeyn is\nluminous;\nshe is quite\nsimply a\nrevelation\nThe epic tale Scotland deserves\nAgyness Deyn shines in this luminous film from masterful director Terence Davies\nGuthrie shows off his acting range,\nstarting out as a blushing lad who\ncan barely make eye contact with\nChris, before being transformed\ninto a man possessed by images\nof trenches churning up the soil\nof northern France, swallowing\ncomrades in a war orchestrated by\nEnglish generals.\nWhere the film really shines,\nhowever,isinMichaelMcDonough\u2019s\ngorgeous cinematography, which\nmakes use of a multitude of lighting\nconditions:seeing Guthrie bent over\na single candle, it\u2019s like watching a\npainting by the Dutch masters come\nto life; a scene in church is flooded\nwith a seemingly righteous white\nlight, blinding the parishioners as\nmuch as the pastor\u2019s sermon on\ncowardice and German sympathy;\nmultiple sweeping landscape shots\ndrink in the highlands of Scotland,\nrevealing more than a touch of\nTerence Malick\u2019s influence. It is\nobvious that adapting the novel for\nthe big screen has been a labour\nof love for Davies, and yet there\nis the sense that perhaps he has\nagonised too much about keeping\nclose to the source material. At 135\nminutes long, the film is no short\nwatch, and yet an issue with pacing\nmeans that characters and events\ncome and go like cars on motorway,\nwhizzing past us with enough force\nto make us dizzy. This, combined\nwith Davies\u2019 beautifully portentous\nfilming style, one that borders on\nthe laconic, means that the film has\nthe unusual quality of being both\ntoo slow and too fast.\nBut still, the film would have to\ngo far to lose its charm. With a\nstunning central turn from Agyness\nDeyn \u2013 surely one to watch out\nfor in the future \u2013 and beautiful\ncamera-work throughout, Scotland\nhas finally received, in Sunset Song,\nthe film epic it so truly deserves.\nDocumentary corner: March of the Penguins\nBen Collier\nFilm Writer\nS\no, the thinking behind the\nsegment on this final week\nis that penguins equal snow,\nand snow equals Christmas.\nIt\u2019s a little tenuous but, to be honest,\nit\u2019s as good an excuse as any to\nfinally feature this film. Up there\nwith Disney\u2019s Chimpanzee and\nAttenborough\u2019s LIFE television\nseries, March of the Penguins, a\nFrench feature-length nature\ndocumentary, is one of the most\nfamous of its kind. As the name\nsuggests, March of the Penguins\ntells the story of the annual single-file trek of the Antarctic Emperor\npenguins towards their breeding\nground. Unlike many of their\nwinged relatives, penguins must\nmake their migrations (in this case,\nover 70 miles) on foot. Morgan\nFreeman narrates the journey as\nthe natural phenomenon unfolds,\nand we are treated to classic and\nmemorable scenes of the penguins\nprotecting their soon-to-be newborns from the harsh cold of their\ncontinent.\nThe film is not as light-hearted\nas its posters and adverting may\nlead you to believe. For a Frenchdirected/produced story there is\nremarkably little romanticism or\nsentimentality \u2013 the audience is left\nto feel for the penguins through an\nobjective lens that showcases their\nunique methods for survival with a\nprofessional distance.\nUnlike many other\nnature documentaries \u2013 the\naforementioned Chimpanzee, for\nexample,is an offender in this regard\n\u2013 anthropomorphism isn\u2019t a staple\nhere. This, however, does not stop\nthe film from being an emotive and\ngenuinely beautiful in places. Some\nof the scenes that the filmmakers\nand cinematographers spent weeks\nfreezing in tents to capture are\nwholly awe-inspiring.\nThe penguins themselves are\npainted as almost a single organism.\nThe extreme conditions of their\nenvironment mean that they must\nput the interests of one another\nabove selfish individuality; without\nthis comradery the penguins could\nnot survive. In this way one begins\nto appreciate the razor-sharp\nhoning these birds have undergone\nin order to perfect their survival\ntactics over a vast number of years.\nHowever, a focus on the individual\nis key for the narrative here and at\ntimes, drama on the individual level\nis the focus with the \u2018whole\u2019 merely\nproviding a back-drop. Penguins\npractice monogamy, which entails\nthem mating and caring for their\noffspring with only one other, and\nthis aspect of caring parenthood is\none of the only times the objective\nlens of the documentary is allowed\nto be lifted.\nThe pacing of the movie is the\nkey to its success. As a viewer, one\nis easily able to lose themselves in\nthe shot-by-shot flow of the story.\nAn excellent rhythm is set up as\nwe cut from group to individual,\nexperiencing all the highs and\nlows of these animals\u2019 time-old\nexpedition.\nAs a nature-loving biologist my\nopinion may be biased but I cannot\npraise this film and the team behind\nit enough. March of the Penguins\nis the first of the documentaries\ncovered in this section which I\ncannot see anyone not enjoying at\nleast to some extent.\nAntarctic beauty: penguins making the perilous journey in March of the Penguins. Photo Credit: March of the Penguins PR\nA\nrelentlessly bleak\nmorality tale from\nBulgaria, The Lesson\nstarts off immediately\nby showing us the upright character\nof our antagonist, Nade (Margita\nGosheva), a secondary school\nteacher with a troublemaking thief\nin her class.\nI\nn an effort to enforce the\nseriousness of stealing, she\ngives them the chance to\nreturn the money in secret,\nthreatens to report them to the\npolice, and even has everyone in the\nclass chip in to replace the stolen\nmoney, investing their interests\nin catching the thief. But her\nprofessionally stern attitude towards\nright and wrong is in direct conflict\nwith Nade\u2019s personal life, which is\nrapidly spiralling out of control.\nUpon returning home one day,\nshe finds bailiffs ready to repossess\nthe house; it turns out that her\nhusband (Ivan Barnev) has been\nspending the money ring-fenced for\nmortgage repayments on restoring a\ncamper-van, and Nade must resort\nto a crooked loan-shark in order to\nsave the house.\nLike the Dardenne brothers\u2019\nexcellent Two Days, One Night, this\nis a damning exploration of the\npressures debts can place on the\nindividual. Nade is constantly living\nunder a burden, one that \u2013 as we see\nby the ending of the film \u2013 cannot\nbe scrubbed completely from her\nconscience.\nThis life, one of crushing debt, is\na regular occurrence in a world still\nbleeding from the financial crisis,\nand directors Kristina Grozeva and\nPetar Valchanov do well to follow\nthe extraordinary twists and turns\nof such a mundane happening.\nThere are dramatic moments in\nThe Lesson that feel more taut than\nany recent thriller, and instances of\ninjustice that sting more than those\nfound in political dramas. This is\na film that revels in the minutiae\nof everyday oppression, of bank\ntransfer charges and washing up\nleft undone; Gosheva is magnetic\nas Nade, imbuing the role with a\nnear-autistic sense of justice that is\nsteadily eroded over the film\u2019s 105\nminutes, which just fly by.\nThe details of her personal life\nThe Lesson\nDir: Kristina Grozeva, Petar\nValchanov.

Gingerbread\nis also much stronger under\ncompression than in tension (I\u2019ve\ngot the data to back it up), so bear\nthat in mind in your design.\nThe glue\nFor construction, use royal icing\nsugar (or a mix of normal icing\nsugar and powdered egg white) and\na few drops of water or lemon juice\nto bring it into a paste. You need\nto be able to pipe the icing, but the\nstiffer it is, the better it will hold\nyour gingerbread together. Put it in\na piping bag (you can make these\nout of baking paper or even ziploc\nbags,just Google it) and you\u2019re good\nto go.\nThe construction\nIt will take at least two people\nto assemble your gingerbread\nmasterpiece, depending on the\ndesign \u2013 one to hold the pieces in\nplace, and the other to pipe icing\ninto the joint. Don\u2019t forget to use\nthe icing to stick the gingerbread\ndown too, or it won\u2019t be as strong.\nOnce some pieces are in place,\nadd more pieces that support each\nother, or place something to hold\nthe gingerbread while the icing sets\na bit before adding more. Try and\nlet each layer set as long as you can\nbefore building up.\nThe decoration\nOnceyou\u2019vebuiltyourmasterpiece,\nyou need to make it look extra\nbeautiful. Simply take more icing\nand bejewel your gingerbread with\nsweets and chocolate and whatever\nyou like. You get bonus points for\nintegrating the decoration into the\ndesign rather than making it look\nlike you\u2019ve thrown a sweetshop at it.\nThe eating\nThis is the best part. You don\u2019t\nneed my help.\nThis undeniably vaguely resembles the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia (completed design). Photo Credit: Max Hunter\nThe wheat\nstarch will\nundergo\na phase\ntransition\nfrom a\ncrystalline\nto a glassy\nstate\nThis design may be a little too sophisticated for a first try. Photo Credit: risd.edu\nA\nre you impressed by the\ngingerbread towers on\nthe right? Do you want\nto bake a slightly less\ntime-consuming version of it to\nimpress your friends and family this\nChristmas? Well, you can.\nThe design\nFirst, you need to decide what you\nwant to make. I suggest sketching\nit out and using your high school\ngeometry skills (or CADing the\ndesign if you\u2019re taking this really\nseriously). Keep in mind that\ngingerbread expands slightly when\nyou bake it, so leave some leeway\nin your design. Once you\u2019ve got the\nshapes for all of your pieces, cut out\ntemplates, and start cooking.\nThe recipe\nI could convert all measurements\nto sensible units,but instead I\u2019m just\ngoing to give you a conversion rate:\n1oz=28.34g\n16oz flour\n1 tbsp dried ground ginger\n\u00bd tbsp ground cinnamon\n6oz butter or margarine\n8oz soft brown sugar\n1 egg\n4-6 tbsp golden syrup\nThe method\nPlace the flour and spices in a\nbowl with the butter and rub the\nbutter into the flour to form a\ncoarse crumb. Then add the sugar\nand combine, before adding the\nremaining ingredients and mashing\ntogether with your hands until it\nforms a dough. Start with 4tbsp\nof golden syrup and add more if it\nwon\u2019t come together.\nRoll out the dough to around\n0.5-1cm thick on a floured surface\n(alternatively do this between\nsheets of greaseproof paper to\nstop it sticking), and then cut into\nthe desired shapes. For building,\nprecision is key, so keep it as neat as\nyou can.\nBake on a baking tray lined with\nbaking paper at 180\u00b0C for 6-8\nminutes, or until the gingerbread is\nan even brown colour. Once it\u2019s out\nthe oven, let it cool completely on a\nwire rack while it sets.\nThe science\nFor sturdier constructions, roll any\nload-bearing pieces slightly thinner,\nand bake them for a bit longer at\na lower temperature so that they\nare extra stiff. After a day or so\nthey\u2019ll soften again so that they\u2019re\nactually edible. The wheat starch\nwill undergo a transition from a\ncrystalline to a glassy state during\nbaking and cooling \u2013 this is what\nTessa Davey\nComment Editor\n\n"

It\u2019s the newest\nentry to the essential Christmas\nwatch list \u2013 but it is only one of a\nlong list of films. Let\u2019s take a look\nsome others:\nGrandma Got Run Over\nby a Reindeer (2000)\nI\u2019m just going to get this one\nout of the way. Grandma Got Run\nOver by a Reindeer is a straight-to-video Christmas special based\non a novelty song of the same\nname. I have now seen this film\nfifteen times \u2013 that\u2019s once a year\nsince I started primary school.\nI personally blame early 2000s\nCartoon Network \u2013 and their\nannual showing of the film \u2013 for\nits entry to this list. Best utilised\nin Christmases spent with\nyounger relatives, the film should\nserve as enjoyable cheesy fun one\nlate December afternoon.\nLove Actually (2003)\nIt\u2019s a very British Christmas.\nRichard Curtis\u2019 story of love\nin the Christmas season, told\nthrough several characters, could\nbe considered simultaneously\namongst the best rom-coms and\nChristmas films. Each story\nfeatured in this film \u2013 with\nthe exception of that sodding\ndrummer kid \u2013 can be considered\nclassics in their own right. Colin\nFirth and Emma Thompson\u2019s\nstories stand out to me but the\ncharm here is that everyone has\ntheir own favourites.\nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\n(1946)\nCome on you whippersnappers.\nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life is rightfully\nsupposed to be the quintessential\nChristmas film. A worrying\nnumber of my contemporaries\ngo against all laws of the universe\nand fail to watch this annually \u2013\nif at all! George Bailey\u2019s life story,\nwith its highs and deep lows,is the\nperfect reason, during Christmas,\nto remember the importance of\ngood things in life.\nBEN COLLIER\nOur writers\u2019 top film picks of\n2015\n1. It Follows\n2. Ex Machina\n3. Mad Max: Fury Road\n4. Inside Out\n5. The Martian\nTaking the top spot, horror film It\nFollows has haunted me since I first\nsaw it earlier this year. The superb\nyet terrifying cinematography\n(including some sick 360-degree\npans) and ominous electronic\nscore from video-game composer\nDisasterpeace, result in the best\nhorror film this side of The Badabook.\nAs a computer scientist, films\nabout artificial intelligence have\na special place in my heart, and\nEx Machina is easily the best yet,\nthanks to an intelligent script and an\nappropriately robotic performance\nfrom rising star Alicia Vikander\n(even if it was basically a TED talk\nabout the Turing test).\nWith Mad Max: Fury Road,\nGeorge Miller flipped the bleak,\nmale dominated action film\nindustry on its head. Unbelievable\nstunts and excellent editing were\novershadowed by underlying\nfeminist(-lite) themes and the\nbadassery of Charlize Theron.\nInside Out provided laughs,\ntears, and relief from Pixar\u2019s recent\nlineup of awful sequels. It perfectly\ncaptured the emotional turbulence\nof moving school, leaving old\nfriends behind, and the struggle to\nfit in (just thinking about the film\nmakes me sad).\nThe Martian, a film as funny as it\nwas scientifically accurate, proved\nafter a series of disappointing films\nthat Ridley Scott was still capable\nof creating a brilliant blockbuster\n(maybe the next Alien might\nactually be good).\nCALE TILFORD\nPhoto Credit: PA\n1. The Lobster\n2. Carol\n3. Brooklyn\n4. Macbeth\nThe Lobster was pretty much\nthe only film this year that kept\nme frozen in my seat until the\nend. Leaving the viewer with that\nfeeling of uneasiness, common to\npretty much all his films, director\nYorgos Lanthimos really makes you\nponder \u201cWhat is this thing we call\nlove?\u201d, the question Sophia Loren\nsings as the credits roll. Having\nseen Dogtooth and Alps, we need to\npraise Lanthimos not only for the\nrecognition he has obtained, but\nalso for his characteristic style that\nhe\u2019s preserved, distinguishing him\nas a bona fide auteur. The Lobster\nis bold, thought-provoking, and\nunnerving. Lanthimos fabricates a\nsurreal world, which the audience\nis lured into sooner or later, left to\nwonder how pure and harmless a\nfeeling love really is.\nOnto Carol: you had me at Cate\nBlanchett, but lesbian period drama\nshot in 16mm? Sold.As well as being\na beautiful film to watch, Rooney\nMara exceeded all my expectations\nin her role as Therese, and I thought\nthe chemistry between her and\nBlanchett was extraordinary.\nOne of the sweetest films I\u2019ve\nseen this year, Brooklyn, focuses on\nthe idea of home, through the story\nof Eilis (Saoirse Ronan), an Irish\nimmigrant who moves to 1950\u2019s\nNew York in search of a better life.\nHer first love interest,Tony (Emory\nCohen) is possibly one of the most\nlikable protagonists in recent film\nhistory. For its beautiful, unforced\ntelling of a story so relevant even\nin our days, Brooklyn is definitely\nworth a mention.\nI admit that I didn\u2019t catch every\nsingle one of Shakespeare\u2019s verses in\nMacbeth (the Scottish accents made\nit pretty hard), but Fassbender and\nCotillard both delivered extremely\npowerful performances. I won\u2019t\npretend I knew who Justin Kurzel\nwas before Macbeth, but if every\nmovie he directs is as majestic as\nthis one, I\u2019d like to believe that his\nbest is yet to come.\nDIEGO APARICIO\n1. Wild Tales\n2. Sicario\n3. Mad Max: Fury Road\n4. Inherent Vice\n5. Carol\n6. Love\n7. Steve Jobs\n8. Ex Machina\n9. The Lobster\n10. Macbeth\nIn all, I would say 2015 has been\nanother great year for cinema. The\nfilms I\u2019ve chosen represent a mix of\nthose I found to have that unique\nbalance between entertainment\nvalue and also technical merit.\nMy top 3: Wild Tales in particular\nwas the biggest surprise and had\nthe most impact; an Argentinian\nblack comedy film written and\ndirected by Dami\u00e1n Szifron, Wild\nTales is an anthology, composed\nof six standalone shorts united by\na common theme of violence and\nvengeance. It produced the biggest\ngrin I\u2019ve had this year after I left the\nscreening \u2013 it was so much fun. If\nTarantino made a Latin-American\nfilm this would be it.\nSicario was beautifully shot and\nchoreographed with a haunting\nsoundtrack. The night vision scene\nand Benicio Del Toro\u2019s incredible\nperformance were standouts.\nMad Max: Fury Road showed us\nonce again what makes the film\nmedium so unique by being able\nto tell and world build the story\nthrough visual design and costume\nrather than endless exposition (plus\nthere\u2019s a dude playing a guitar with\nflamethrowers in chase - what more\ncould you want?).\nNote: Special mention and shout\nout to films yet to be released in UK\nlike The Revenant, Hateful Eight,\nAnamolisa, Son of Saul, and many\nmore \u2013 curse you distributers!\nARNOLD DURRALIU\nPhoto Credit: Sony Pictures\n1. The Lobster\n2. Listen Up Philip\n3. The Duke of Burgundy\n4. Carol\n5. Inherent Vice\n6. Wild Tales\n7. Whiplash\n8. A Girl Walks Home Alone\nat Night\n9. Inside Out\n10. World of Tomorrow\nWhen I ran back through my\nfavourite films of the past year, the\ntrend that stood out immediately\nwas an abundance of refreshing\ncomedy. It\u2019s something that my\npick of the bunch, The Lobster, has\nin spades. A deadpan vision of\na dystopian future in which not\nfinding a suitable partner results in\nbeing transformed into an animal\nof your choice, the films starts off\nat a specialised hotel where Colin\nFarrell\u2019s David is given 45 days to\nfind a match after his wife leaves\nhim. The perpetually bemused and\nbumbling David is a great foil for\nthe audience as he journeys through\nthe daily routine of his new prison;\nthe dialogue is dry and the absurdity\nof the world that Lanthimos creates\nis played for laughs with a dark\nundercurrent.\nAs David falls in with rebels,\nthe imagination and mischievous\nspirit are kept, and the film ends\non a high-note reminiscent of a\nmemorable scene from the director\u2019s\nbreakout 2010 film Dogtooth. Rarely\ndoes a film so oddball feel so fully-formed and that\u2019s what makes The\nLobster stand out amongst a crowd\nof gorgeous and clever films.\nOther highlights of the year\nincluded Alex Ross Perry\u2019s razor-sharp portrait of a self-centred\nauthor, Listen Up Philip. The Duke of\nBurgundy, Peter Strickland\u2019s second\nstraight smash, is a beguiling,\ntender and surprisingly funny look\nat a strained master-and-servant\nrelationship in a world inhabited\nsolely by women; the stylish\nmonochrome vampire flick A Girl\nWalks\u2026; and a pair of delightful\nanimations in Pixar\u2019s Inside Out and\nWorld of Tomorrow, an inscrutable\nyet gorgeous short from the mind of\nthe essential Don Herdzfeldt.\nMAX LEWIS-CLARKE\nPhoto Credit: Picturehouse Cinemas\n1. Carol\n2. The Falling\n3. Mommy\n4. The Duke of Burgundy\n5. A Girl Walks Home Alone\nat Night\n6. The Tribe\n7. Timbuktu\n8. Tangerine\n9. 45 Years\n10. The Lobster\nForeign films dominated this\nyear for me. Abderrahmane\nSissako brought us Timbuktu, a\npowerful exploration of growing\nIslamist threats in Mali; an urgent\nfilm at its release, the increasing\nrestlessness of global politics has\njust made it more relevant. Ana\nLily Amirpour impressed with her\ndebut feature, the western Persian\nvampire feminist horror A Girl\nWalks\u2026, while Ukrainian Myroslav\nSlaboshpytskiy shocked us with his\nfilm The Tribe \u2013 set in a school for\ndeaf children, the only sound was\nthe shocking attacks of violence.\nThe Lobster saw Yorgos Lanthimos\nmaking his English-language debut,\nretaining his jet-black humour.\nSeveral directors made their\nwelcome return to the screen: Xavier\nDolan picked up the Jury Prize at\nCannes for his fifth film since 2009,\nthe heart-wrenching Mommy, while\nBritish auteur Peter Strickland\nmined the rich seam of 1970s film\nhe explored in his previous feature,\nBerberian Sound Studio, in the richly\nrealized The Duke of Burgundy.\nAndrew Haigh\u2019s long-awaited\nfollow up to his debut Weekend\nwas released: 45 Years, an evocative\nPhoto Credit: Wilson Webb\nexploration of an aging couple, with\nstunning central performances.\nElsewhere, Tangerine broke new\nground with its central duo of trans\nwomen smashing down barriers\n\u2013 the fact that it was filmed on an\niPhone was just by the by.\nI have already spent enough\nwords on the beauty of Carol, so I\nwill not dwell on it here. Suffice to\nsay it is one of the most ravishing,\nemotionally layered films I have\nseen in recent years.\nSpeakingofCarols,CarolMorley\u2019s\nfilm The Falling is perhaps the film\nthat has stayed with me the longest;\never since I saw it in April I\u2019ve been\nthinking about it, not least due to\nthe beautiful cinematography, and\nhaunting score from Tracey Thorn.\nFRED FYLES\n1. Whiplash\n2. Me & Earl & the Dying Girl\n3. Inside Out\n4. Hinterland\n5. Inherent Vice\n6. A Most Violent Year\n7. Mad Max: Fury Road\n8. Straight Outta Compton\n9. Macbeth\n10. Dope\n2015 in film wasn\u2019t quite the stellar\nrun of masterpiece after masterpiece\nthat 2014 turned out to be, and as\na result it\u2019s felt like something of\na comedown. However, as truly\nexcellent films have been fewer and\nfar between this year, standouts\nfrom the slew of weighty bravura\npieces and lacklustre blockbusters\nhave appeared all the better \u2013 and\nhave been all the more appreciated.\nThese standouts came in all shapes\nand sizes, from the beautifully\nintimate and atmospheric\nHinterland and the sprawling,\nhilariously hazy Inherent Vice, to the\nepic, fist-pumping sweep of Straight\nOutta Compton and the thick,\nbrooding darkness of Macbeth and\nA Most Violent Year.\nThere were even some decidedly\nmainstream films that knocked it\nout of the park: Inside Out is possibly\nPixar\u2019s best film of the past ten years.\nAt a time when action franchises\nhave in essence started taking\nthe piss (Ant-Man, Terminator:\nGenisys\u2026), the latest Mad Max\nemerged as the most visceral and\nbreath-taking action movie in\nrecent memory, and a milestone in Photo Credit: Cold Open\nmasterful action filmmaking of The\nDark Knight-like proportions.\nBest of all was the kooky,hilarious,\nand yet genuinely touching Me &\nEarl & the Dying Girl,and Whiplash.\nIt would feel like cheating to include\nWhiplash in this year\u2019s top ten list\nif it wasn\u2019t just such a damn great\nfilm \u2013 it hit UK cinemas way back\nin January, but nothing this year (or\nindeed last year) has topped it. It\u2019s\na genuinely thrilling dual-character\nstudy of a boy who wants to be\nthe best and a man who thinks he\nknows what it takes to be the best,\nwith pitch-perfect performances\nand an ending more stunning than\nany ending has any right to be \u2013\neven the thought of it will give me\nchills for years to come.\nTOM STEPHENS\nPhoto Credit: Picturehouse Cinemas\nHot or Not?\n2015 Edition\nNoah Baumbach\nThis year saw the f\u00eated\ndirector release not one, but\ntwo films into the cinemas.\nWhile We\u2019re Young garnered\nrave reviews, and Mistress\nAmerica saw him teaming up\nwith Greta Gerwig again.\nStreaming Sites\nNetflix has been changing\nthe game for years, but\nAmazon Prime got in on\nthe action this year.

Many women argued\nthat by playing up to the gender\nstereotype of women caring more\nabout their looks, the campaign had\nlost sight of the gender stereotype it\nwas trying to lambaste.\nMany female scientists on Twitter\nadopted the IBM\u2019s #hackahairdryer\nhashtag to point out the\ncontradiction.\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, IBM, I\u2019d rather build\nsatellites instead, but good luck\nwitht that whole #HackAHairDryer\nthing,\u201d said one user.\nThe internet had a whale of time over this one.

These Distributed Denial\nof Service hacks account for up\nto a third of outage incidents, and\nexperts estimate that 2000 occur per\nday. Such attacks can be purchased\nfor as little as \u00a3100 online.\nThe academic network stopped\nupdating the situation on its major\nincident Twitter page as it believed\nthese details were aiding hackers.\nThe Joint Information Systems\nCommittee, which runs Janet, was\nforced to shut down its own website\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nOurs was one of hundreds of university networks attacked this week\nFemale scientists wondered whether men would be asked to hack a beard trimmer\n\u201cI leave hairdryer fixing to the\nmen, I\u2019m too busy making nanotech\nand treating cancer\u201d said another .\nThe mocking continued\nthroughout the day, until IBM\neventually decided to pull the\ncampaign. By then, even the\nLondon Fire Brigade had chipped\nin on Twitter, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re staying\nout of the sexism debate, however,\nwe\u2019d suggest that it\u2019s generally a bad\nidea & possibly a bit dangerous to\n#HackAHairDryer\u201d.\nIBM said afterwards that the\ncampaign had \u201cmissed the mark\nfor some\u201d. They\u2019d been running the\ninitiative since October, but began\npublicising it again on Monday.\nOn a webpage for the scheme\non IBM\u2019s website, the company\ndescribed the \u201chair-raising\nmisconceptions\u201d about women in\nscience that were putting women\noff.This has since been removed.\nThis misfire makes a change for\nIBM, who are known for being\nStudents\nacross the\ncountry were\nprevented\nfrom\nsubmitting\nwork on time\na relatively diverse company.\nThey have a female CEO, Ginni\nRometty, and have always claimed\nto have paved the way for women\nin technology, saying on their\nwebsite: \u201cWhere many companies\nproudly date their affirmative action\nprograms to the 1970s, IBM has\nbeen creating meaningful roles for\nfemale employees since the 1930s.\u201d\nThis is the second time this year\na company has gone awry in its PR\npursuit for women in STEM.

For this reason, they are unable\nto maintain a minimal normal body\nweight. Although anorexia nervosa\nmost commonly affects women in\ntheir mid-teens, there has been a\nrecent increase in the number of\ncases seen in young men. Prevalence\nofanorexianervosaishardtoidentify\nsince a large proportion of people\naffected choose not to seek help,\nand therefore remain unidentified.\nHowever,the Department of Health\nestimates that the total number of\npeople affected is approximately\nfour million.\nA typical case of a patient with\nanorexia nervosa is that of a teenager\nwho may be of average weight or\nslightly overweight, and decides to\nbegin a new lifestyle plan to lose\nweight. As they lose weight, they\nreceive feedback from others that\nfurther stimulates the weight-losing\nbehaviour \u2013 positive reinforcement.\nThe dependence on the reward for\nthis behaviour becomes so strong\nthat even when an ideal (or desired)\nweight is achieved, the anorexic\nperson is unable to stop their weight\nloss.\nAnorexic people usually have an\nunforgiving diet, with obsessive\nbehaviour regarding the avoidance\nof fatty food, strict calorie counting\nand persistent weight monitoring.\nThey may also take appetite-suppressants, self-induce frequent\nvomiting, and abuse laxatives.\nPhysically, patients may not appear\nto be starving. However, there are\nsomecharacteristicfeaturesofpeople\nwith anorexia that include lanugo\nhair, callouses on the dorsum of the\ndominant hand with enamel erosion\n(due to purging) and swelling of the\nparotid and submandibular glands.\nThe primary metabolic problem in\npatients is that of malnutrition due\nto starvation-induced changes.\nThe long-term health implications\nof anorexia nervosa include both\nsomatic and psychosocial effects.\nSomatic effects, largely due to the\nmalnutrition, include osteoporosis,\ninfertility, anaemia and poor organ\nfunction (particularly dental and\nrenal). The psychosocial effects, also\nwell document, include poor social\nfunctioning, sexual disinterest and\nsuicidal thoughts.\nFrom the catwalk to reality; the new size six sets an unhealthy \u201cperfectionist\u201d\nbody image. Photo Credit: David Shankbone\nUnforgiving diets plague the lives of anorexic people. Photo Credit: Benjamin Watson\nUtsav K Radia\nWriter\nAs anorexia nervosa is considered\nprimarily a psychological disorder,\nit requires a clinical diagnosis.\nThere are no definitive diagnostic\ntests, however a medical evaluation\ncan be made of the multi-organ\neffects of starvation. Common tests\nwould include a full blood count,\nurine analysis, metabolic panel,\nelectrocardiogram and physical and\nmental status examination.\nThe main goal in management\nof anorexia is restoring adequate\nnutrition in patients. Ideally,\nintervention should occur before\nthe malnutrition precipitates\nany secondary physiological and\npsychological problems. In most\npatients, refeeding is done slowly\n(to reduce the risk of refeeding\nsyndrome). Fluid and electrolyte\nreplacement is also very important,\nas patients are often dehydrated\nand have lost a lot of electrolytes\nthrough vomiting and purging.\nPsychological therapy has proven\nto be the most successful treatment\nfor patients so far, according to\nNational Institute for Healthcare\nand Excellence (NICE) guidelines.\nIt focuses on promoting weight gain\nand healthy eating and promotes\npsychological recovery. A variety\nof psychological therapies are used\nin practice and include: cognitive\nbehavioural therapy (CBT), group\ntherapy, family therapy, dietary\ncounselling and interpersonal\ntherapy. Patients often respond best\nto family therapy, which is proven\nto achieve as well as maintain\nremission.\nPharmacological therapy\nin anorexia nervosa includes\nantidepressants (tricyclic\nAnorexia\nNervosa\nis hard to\nidentify\nas a large\nproportion\nof people\naffected\nchoose\nnot to seek\nhelp\nWhat do you know about anorexia?\nantidepressants and selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors,\nSSRIs), antihistamines and\nantipsychotics. However, there is\ninsufficient evidence to suggest that\nthese have any significant effect on\nweight gain compared to placebo\nduring multi-modal inpatient\ntreatment.Limited current evidence\nsuggests that fluoxetine (SSRI) may\nreduce the likelihood of relapse after\ninpatient weight restoration.\nOverall, the current clinical\npicture is not optimistic. Although\nvarious forms of psychological and\npharmacological treatment for\nanorexia are useful in the induction\nand maintenance of remission,\nevidence collected by NICE\nsuggests that long-term benefits\nmay not be sustained. Often, the\nfocus of treatment shifts in the long\nterm towards improving quality\nof life through managing the\nsecondary complications of anorexia\nnervosa.\nPerhaps, if it were possible to\nidentify at-risk individuals at\nan earlier stage, and implement\nmeasures to prevent the onset of\nthe secondary complications of\nanorexia nervosa, a lot of the disease\nburden on the individual (as well\nas the healthcare service) could be\nalleviated?\nAlthough it has been over 150\nyears since French neuropsychiatrist\nErnest Charles Las\u00e8gue first\ndescribed anorexia nervosa, we\nare still far away from being able\nto help patients either before they\ndevelop secondary complications,\nor even to help them recover from\nthose complications in a timely and\nefficient manner.\nMiquel Sureda\nWriter\nThe launch of LISA Pathfinder\nO\nne century ago Albert\nEinstein predicted the\nexistenceofgravitational\nwaves in his General\nTheory of Relativity. However, they\nhave not been directly detected yet,\nas their effect is tiny and can only\nbe appreciated when looking at\nhuge bodies such as planets, stars\nor galaxies. The successful launch\nof LISA Pathfinder, carried out on\nthe 3rd\nof December, is the first step\nof an ambitious project to finally\nconfirm their existence.\nGravitational waves are supposed\nto be ripples in the fabric of space-time, generated by accelerating\nmassive objects. If they do exist,\ntheir nature would be analogous to\nthat of electromagnetic waves (light,\nmicrowaves, X rays etc), which are\nthe result of accelerating electrical\ncharges. Einstein\u2019s theory predicts\nthat gravitational waves transport\nenergy as gravitational radiation,\nand that when passing a distant\nobserver, that observer finds spacetime distorted by the effects of\nstrain.\nLet us think of the explosion\nof a distant star at the very end\nits life (a phenomenon known\nas a supernova). Gravitational\nwaves from this violent explosion\ntravel across the Universe almost\nunimpeded, unlike light, which gets\nIn the search of gravitational waves 100 years after the the birth of general relativity\nabsorbed by gas and dust. When\nthey pass thought the Earth they\nproduce minute changes in the size\nof our planet, but only by about a\nmillionth of the size of an atom,\nmaking them almost impossible to\nmeasure.\nEuropean Space Agency\u2019s LISA\nPathfinder is the first gravitational\nlaboratory for fundamental physics\nthat has been launched into space\nand will test the cutting edge\ntechnologies needed to detect\nand measure gravitational waves\nin the future. The spacecraft will\noperate at a distance of 1.5 million\nkilometres from Earth, between our\nplanet and the Sun, orbiting a stable\nvirtual point called the first SunEarth Lagrange point (L1). There,\nan experiment will attempt to\ndemonstrate whether it is possible\nto free a pair of test masses from\nall forces except gravity. This is an\nessential underlining condition to\ndetect gravitational waves in space.\nLISA Pathfinder will do so by\nmonitoring the motion of two\nidentical 46mm gold-platinum\ncubes that will be free-floating in\nspace, 38 centimetres from one\nanother. Between them, a laser\ninterferometer will measure the\nrelative separation of the two\ncubes to unprecedented accuracy\nas external and internal forces\ndisturb the spacecraft around them.\nIf the experiment proves to be\nsensitive enough, it will be able to\nmeasure the tiny movements of the\nMission control teams in the main control room at ESOC.

Siewert - CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\nmasses caused by the passage of a\ngravitational wave.\nScaled up, it is like tracking the\ndistance between the tops of the\nShard in London and the One\nWorld Trade Centre in New York,\nand noticing any changes down\nto just fractions of the width of\na human hair. \u201cWe use the laser\ninterferometer to bounce light\nbetween the proof masses and the\noptical structure that we built in\nGlasgow,\u201dsays Dr Harry Ward from\nGlasgow University, UK.\nHowever, to ensure that the\nexperiment works correctly, it is\ncrucial that gravity is the only force\nacting on both cubes. This means\nthat they must be able to float in\ntheir respective vacuum chambers\nwithout being in contact with\nany part of the spacecraft. This is\nextremely difficult as the spacecraft\nwill be subjected to perturbing\nforces that, if not cancelled, will\nforce it to move and hit the cubes,\nruining the experiment.\nIn order to avoid this, a precision\npropulsion system with several\nmicro-thrusters will have the\nmission to keep the spacecraft in\nperfect position. Thus, for every\nlittle perturbation that affects the\naircraft the micro-thrusters must\nproduce an identical reaction to\ncancel it, allowing the cubes to float\nundisturbed.\n\u201cLISA Pathfinder is paving\nthe way for a future large space\nobservatory that ultimately will\ndirectly observe and precisely\nmeasure gravitational waves,\u201d said\nFran\u00e7ois Auque, head of space\nsystems at Airbus Defence and\nSpace. \u201cThese minute distortions\nin space-time require very sensitive\nand highly precise measuring\ntechnologies, the performance of\nwhich can only be tested in a space\nenvironment.\u2019\u201d\nWhen and if LISA Pathfinder\nproves the effectiveness of this\ninnovative technology, the next step\nwill be another,much bigger mission\ninvolving up to three spacecraft\nseparated by five million kilometres.\nEach spacecraft will carry a cube\ninside and again, a laser will be used\nto monitor their relative position.\nThe huge distances between the\nspacecrafts, will allow scientists\nto detect very low frequency\ngravitational waves from very large\nobjects such as supermassive black\nholes at the centres of galaxies.\nIf everything goes well, this\nfuture mission, named 2034-LISA, will open a new window to\nour gravitational universe. \u201cLISA\nPathfinder is a mission looking into\na new science, a new way of doing\nastronomy,\u201d explains Cesar Garc\u00eda,\nLISA Pathfinder project manager\n(ESA). \u201cAnd this new era in space\nscience, first predicted by Albert\nEinstein just one hundred years ago,\nwill change forever the way we see\nthe Universe around us.\u201d\nIt is paving\nthe way\nfor a future\nlarge space\nobservatory\nA look inside LISA Pathfinder.

A small fishing town off the Tsushima Basin. They wouldn\u2019t even let me see the\nticket.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did they send you there for?\u201d\nA pause. I look him straight in the eye, see his face contorted in a storm of emotion: pity, sorrow, affection.\n\u201cFor cleansing.\u201d I admit, head bowed. \u201cThey wanted to snuff out the homosexuality.\u201d\n\u201cI stayed with my uncle in his cabin.

We ended up talking about childhood, about loss... about Takumi.\u201d\ndrunk, angry. She smelled of sweat, spicy shavings and cheap perfume. I didn\u2019t even catch her name. I\nthink we both needed it.\nAfterwards, I could only think of you. I couldn\u2019t get you out of my head. Your hands, your eyes, your lips,\nyour tongue. You really do screw with people, Takumi.\nWhen you meet my parents for the first time, you wear eyeliner. You have long hair, purple nail varnish,\na gem in your ear. Why? Did you think you could smash their bigotry to pieces by arriving as the very\nimpersonation of their fears? Did you think they would be shocked into acceptance? Did you ever think\nabout how I could stomach living with them after your whirlwind appearance? Was it all a joke to you?\nAt dinner, you try to make small talk. Banal comments about the layout of the house, my mother\u2019s cooking,\nthe weather. You\u2019re nervous, I can tell from the vein on your forehead, the slight tremor of your fingers, the\nsoft vibrato in your voice. I want to touch you, to hide you, to shield you from their acid glares.\nWhen we\u2019re finally alone, you drop the wig, the make-up, the redundant embellishments and you wink at\nme. \u201cDidn\u2019t that go well?\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d I can\u2019t hide the disappointment in my voice.\n\u201cJust to see their reactions.

Everyone\ngoes home, remembers how\nboring most their extended\nfamily is, and starts panicking about\nJanuary exams. But it also means\nNew Year. And what is New Year, if\nnot an opportunity to make empty\npromises that never stick about\ngetting in shape? While the second\nweek of January is the busiest week\nof the year in the gym, 80% of new\nmembers drop off by mid-February.\nWell, for anyone counting calories\nthis January in a bid to get healthy,\nresearchers at West Virginia\nUniversity have some news that is\neither good or bad \u2013 depending on\nyour biology. New research suggests\nthat most people\u2019s blood sugar levels\nrise and fall irrespective of what\nthey eat.After monitoring the blood\nglucose levels of 800 people who\nwere on exactly the same diet, it was\nfound that levels varied dramatically\nfrom person to person.Furthermore,\nthe blood sugar spike associated\nwith eating foods like cookies was\nnot observed at all in many test\nsubjects, whereas in others, even\neating \u2018healthier\u2019 foods like bananas\nresulted in such spikes. Clay Marsh,\nan epigenetic researcher at the\nuniversity, argues, \u201cfindings indicate\nthat blood sugar spikes after eating\ndepend on not only what you eat,\nbut how your system processes\nthat food.\u201d And it turns out that\nhow your body processes food is\nlargely out of your control. Your\ngut microbe mix, otherwise known\nas the gut \u2018microbiome\u2019, is heavily\ninvolved in digesting food, and has\nbeen implicated in previous studies\nto be integral to causing diabetes\nand obesity.\nSo what can you do to eat\nhealthily? An earlier study showed\nthat personalized diets can help\ncontrol blood sugar levels. A group\nat the Weizmann Institute in Israel\nproduced diets unique to each\nperson, but containing the same\nnumber of calories and levels of\nnutrients. For ten of the twelve\nTurns out those lucky few can eat candy and gut away with it.

So, in February, when\npeople like myself lie in bed eating\nbuttercream icing out the tube, we\ncan take solace in the fact that it\nmight not be as bad as we think.\nI\nt\u2019s the 30th\nNovember, and\nthe Paris Climate Change\nConferences commenced\nonly weeks after Isis\u2019 attacks\non the city. Both events represent\nmomentous global issues plaguing\ntoday\u2019s society. Much debate has\narisen over their linkage. That\nis, does climate change lead to\nconflict? If so, will the resolution of\none help bring about a resolution to\nthe other?\nAs David Cameron streamlines\nhis efforts to \u2018\u2018keep Britain safe\u2019\u2019 via\npursuing a campaign of bombing in\nSyria, his lack of progress towards\nmeeting targets proposed by the\n2008 Climate Change Act seems to\nundermine his commitments. The\nUK is the only G7 nation in the\nprocess of increasing its investments\nin fossil fuels. \u00a31.7 billion has now\nbeen spent financing oil extraction\nin the North Sea, a venture\nexecuted by George Osborne. In\naddition, Cameron has shut down\ndevelopments of offshore wind\nfarms and plans for large scale\nsolar-power plants, concentrating\nefforts towards natural gas while\ndiscouraging competition in\ncarbon capture and storage. A\nstudy published in Nature last\nmonth indicated that with absence\nof efforts to reduce the degree of\nclimate change, temperatures in\nparts of the Middle East such as\nYemen and Iran will soon reach\nlevels uninhabitable for human\nbeings. It is certainly not a formula\nfor achieving world peace. But how\nhas climate change contributed so\nfar to Syria\u2019s civil war?\nLast month, the U.S. Secretary\nof State said that \u2018Primary to the\nproblem in Syria, the country has\nsuccumbed to its worst drought\nin record\u2019. Reports from 2006 to\n2011 document the migration of\n1.5 million Syrian farmers to inner\ncities, intensifying political unrest.\nThe droughts brought about failing\nharvests, tripling food prices and\nsubsequently social strain.\nHowever, climate change as a\ncausal factor for the conflicts in Syria\nis subject to much controversy. For\none,estimates of relocation to urban\nenvironments are provided from\na single media report. The Syrian\ngovernment and UN estimate that\nthere were only 250,000 migrants.\nMigration seems to have occurred\novernight following the cancellation\nof diesel and fertiliser subsidies,\nwith no evidence of any discontent\ntowards these migrants.\nIn my view, conflict analysis\nshould not be so black and white.\nA multitude of complex interacting\nrelationships need to be considered\nto inform efforts to reduce further\nconflict risks. Suggesting climate\nchange as one contributing factor\ntowards Syria\u2019s civil war is not\nsuggesting it as the sole cause. It\u2019s\ncommon sense that water shortages\ncaused by climate change threaten\nthe basic survival of Syrian citizens,\nand thus trigger a deterioration of\nthe country\u2019s economic health. Any\npolitical and economic volatility\nwill aid exploitation of the Syrian\npeople by ISIS groups.\nAll this has been seen before. A\nsudden escalation in the actions of\nthe terrorist group Boko Haram in\nNigeria came after years of severe\ndrought and the inability of the\ngovernment to deal with its effects.\n1933sawtheriseofHitler, following\na period of severe food shortages. A\nClimate change and conflict linkage?\nJane Courtnell\nScience Editor\n30% drop in rainfall since 1998,with\na chronic hunger issue effecting 1.8\nmillion people has been implicated\nin violence plaguing Northern\nMali. One meta-analysis looked\nat 60 rigorous studies focusing on\ncriminology, economic, geographic,\narchaeological, historical, political\nscience, and psychological factors,\nand concluded that there was\na strong link between extreme\nclimates and conflict.\nWe live in a broken economic\nsystem, whereby 85 families own\n85% of global wealth, and 80% of\nthe world\u2019s population own only\n5% of global wealth. It is this 80%\nmajority, contributing the least\nto climate change, that is most\nvulnerabletoitsconsequences. So,to\nreturn to David Cameron, how can\nhe commit so strongly to bombing\ncampaigns, while barely targeting\nclimate change? Regardless of the\nanswer, his policies will have little\neffect until he starts addressing the\nunderlying causes of the Syrian\nconflict.\nIs climate\nchange\ncontributing\nto Syria\u2019s\nconflict?\n\n"
