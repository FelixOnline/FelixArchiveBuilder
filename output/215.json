U. lor the Inter-Collegiate Championship of Great Britain. Among\nthese were four LC. teams the\nfirst two both being among the\neight seeds* The teams were divided into thirteen pools and each\nteam fought the other teams in\ntheir pool on a league basis. The\n1st,2 nd and 3r dI.C. teams won\ntheir pools and the 2nd team then\nhad a bye to the quarter-finals.\nThe first team beat Croydon College of Technology to reach the\nquarter-finals, while the 3rd team\nwere narrowly beaten by Q.M. C.1st who were eventually to reach\nthe final. In the quarter-final\n. Soccer\nTHE SOCCER CLUB\nAT MOTSPUR\nBy R.E. Grundy\nGreat words indeed! On\nSaturday the 13th Marcft, eleven\nmen of I.C. are representing the\nCollege in the London University\nReserves Clip.\nThe I.C. Re'Sfcrve team must\nsurely be one of the strongest in\nthe competition and have strolled\nalmost casually into the final.\nDue to the fact that seven first\nteam players are included in the\nteam they start firm favourites\nagainst a weaker Battersea team.\nEven when one considers the freak\nnumber of injured which have\noccurred in the past fortnight, it\ncannot be foreseen that this team\nwill be beaten.\nDeadly Crisp\nThe strength of the team undoubtedly lies in the skill and\ndeadliness of Crisp at inside forward and the graft of Morland,\nSmart and Cooper at half-back.\nThis combined with the experience of Price and Wojtowicz in\ndefence produces a fine comb in a tion. Kemp, who has been scoring\nby the dozen in recent matches is\nan effective goalscorer and indeed\nscored a hat-trick in the semi-finals. The main weak spot in the\nteam will, if anything, be over-confidence; but under the enthusiastic leadership of Price, one can\nbe sure that this will not happen.\nThe team will be chosen from:\nWojtowicz, Hariss, Price, Cooper,\nMillington, Johnson, Moreland,\nBentham, Crisp, Kemp, Smart,\nLuxton.\nThe kick-off will be 11 a.m. and free coaches will leave at\n9.30 a.m. Win or lose, supporters will be\nensured of an entertaining after-noon, and evening.\nQ.M. C.1st beat I.C.2 nd, while\nI. C.1st beat Battersea 1st. The\nI.C. team then beat Wolverton 1st in the semi-final and so for the\nsecond year, running met Q.M. C. in, the final. This match provided some good Judo with I.C. the winners by two contests to\none.\nEven on Wednesday\nIn the Wednesday afternoon\nleagues the Judo club has continually had to field weak teams\ndue to injury, seminars and the\nlike. Despite this the first team\nbeat all the other colleges and\ncame second only to the Police\nCadets. The other teams all\ndistinguished themselves and even\nthe 6th team beat other colleges\n1st teams.\nRugby,\nAnon.\nOn Saturday 27th February, the\nRugby Club enter ta 'ned the\n\" Ecole des Arts et les Manufactures \" at Harlington, the game\nresulting in a draw three points\neach.\nThe game itself was rather a shambles with I.C. playing with\nfourteen men for the whole match\ndue to the treasurer's fondness of\nsleep. The opposing numbers\nvaried from fourteen to fifteen\ndue to the French wing-forward's insistence on being carried off\nafter each of his frequent injuries.\nAfter the match the I.C. captain\nwas presented with a bottle of\nCognac which was used for\nmedicinal purposes at the inter-Badminton.\nLeage Wins\nBy M. Fitzgerald\nThe I.C. teams have completed\ntheir league fixtures showing the\nClub in an excellent position. The\nmen's team retained the U.L. U. league championship to four\nyears. The mixed team won its\nleague for the first time.\nThe men's league was clinched\nat the end of February when I.C. defeated Northern Poly 9-0. The\nmagnitude of the victory was\nrather surprising considering that\nNorthern Poly had defeated every\nother team in the league.

    "content": "FELIX Warbey on Vietnam\nBoth Hanoi and Saigon claim to be the legal governments of\nthe whole of Vietnam, while at the same time recognising the seventeenth parallel as only a temporary dividing line. The Viet-Cong are\ncomposed of Buddhists, Roman Catholics, peasants and intellectuals,\nas well as the followers of Ho Chi Minh, \"who may be termed\nCommunists.\"'\nThese were the main points made by Mr. Bill Warbey, M.P., at a joint meeting of all the political societies, organised by the CND\ngroup. At this stage few people could argue with his somewhat\ncontroversial views on Vietnam, if only because they lacked his extensive knowledge of South-East Asia. But then he went on to explain\nwho he felt was to blame\u2014'this\nturned out to be none other than\nthe United States.\nThe U.S. had refused to sign\nthe Geneva Agreement on Vietnam, had backed the Ngo Dinh\nDiem and other governments in\nthe South in preventing reunification of the country, and were\nnow hot ting up the war at the\nvery moment when peace negotiations are in progress.\nThese accusations provoked reaction from Mr. Anand, the SCC\nChairman, but seemed to go down\nwell with the Liberals in the person of Edward Fortune.\nFinally, when the chairman,\nProfessor Matthews, asked for a short question to finish the meet-ing, Les Massey, former IC Union\nSecretary and now Chairman of\nSouth Kensington Labour Party,\nasked a five-point question which\nleft the speaker firmly convinced\nthat this was the spokesman of the\nIC Conservatives.\nDEREK BOOTHMAN\nIRISH DEBATING TOUR\nFLOURISHING\nRAILWAY\nOnce again the Railway\nSociety is in the fortunate position of being over subscribed for\nits locomotive-driving outing on\nthe Brentford branch at the beginning of next term. This biannual event is always one of the\nmost popular in their active\ncalendar; and members, who\nhave not yet paid their \u00a32 are reminded that they should do so\nquickly to make sure of their\nplace.\nAnother forthcoming long-distance visit will be to the\nFfestiniog Railway and other\nnarrow-gu age railways in North\nWales during the Easter vacation.\nFurther details of this and other\nRailway Society functions are\nposted on their noticeboard outside the Concert Hall.\nSpecialised\nPostgraduate\nCourses\nat\nCRANFIELD Residential one-year and two-year courses of lectures and\nresearch dealing with a variety of specialised subjects\ncoming under the following broad headings:\nAeronautical Science and Engineering\nAutomobile Engineering\nApplied Mechanics\nElectronic and Control Engineering\nMaterials Science and Technology\nPropulsion Technology\nProduction Engineering\nErgonomics and Systems Design\nOperational Research\nExcellent experimental facilities.

The party, consisting of President David Reich,\nRoger Kitching, Hilary Thompson, and our Celtic interpreter, Ewen\nSmith, was soon being whisked towards Belfast.\nTuesday gave a little time for sightseeing, and an analysis of the\ncomplex politics of Queen's University. In the evening they debated\nthe motion, \" Damn you, Ireland.\" Patrick O 'Donovan proposing\nwas not as in fl amatory as might have been expected.\nGerry Lawless, communist and ex-IRA general, in opposing\nadvocated workers' solidarity and the rejection of the Roman Catholic Church's views on pre-marital intercourse. Ewan Smith, seconding with a rare national fer v our, damned Ireland by pointing out\nthat the English had been just as unfriendly to the Scots.\nRELEVANT REICH\nDavid Reich, seconding Lawless, took a more relevant line than\nhis rebel colleague\u2014pointing out that Ireland had nothing to be\nashamed of. The motion was defeated.\nA minor crunch involving their hired cars (stationary) delayed\nthem slightly but they still managed to reach Dublin by early after-noon.\nThe motion at Trinity College,\nrank with Englishmen, was that\n\"This house agrees with the voters\nof Leyton.\" There were eight\nspeakers with David Reich speaking third for the proposition. He\nargued that the Leyton electorate\nhad the right to change its mind\nand reject an unsatisfactory gov-ern ment. And so to Cork with driver\nReich narrowly avoiding three\ncyclists, one donkey, one Mercedes and a cow. Ewan Smith had\nto leave to be back at I.C. by\nThursday, but the party maintained its gaiety to tackle the\nmotion that \"the Stars and Stripes\nare as big a threat to world peace\nas the Hammer and Sickle,\" at\nUniversity College.\nFOOTBALL MATCH\nThey entered the debating\nchamber to find a crowd worthy\nof a football match, Gaelic cheers\nrang round the theatre. Pax\nHibernica never reigned throughout the jousting. A speaker from\nGalway led a rousing chorus of\n\"Galway Bay\" from the plat-form, and David Reich, opposing,\ntold a dirty joke he had learnt\nfrom the Indian Charge d 'Affaires\nin Dublin. Roger Kitching battled\nmanfully for the proposition, but\na laps us lingua e caused the most,\nunnecessary mirth.\nHilary Thompson talked about\nrape in Texas. \"Insult to the\nHouse \" someone screamed, and\nthe motion was defeated. A bi-national crowd retired to a hotel\nto drink and sing till early\nmorning.\nHILARY THOMPSON\nEASY TO MIX\nThe word is spreading. The\nSouthside Stomps on February\n24th was a really swinging affair.\nIts success was entirely due to the\npeople who came along (about\n300 of them). They were inter-e sting, lively people, some in\ncouples, some in groups; some\ndancing and some listening to the\njazz.\nIn the atmosphere of the\nStomps it is easy to mix\u2014perhaps\nthat's why the many women who\ncome along are older, more intelligent and more attractive than\nthe average Hop-goer.\nThere are only two more\nStomps this term, the next tonight\n(Wednesday).

Has this age of affluence completely diluted the spirit of man\nto compete against fellow-man?\nFor many years I.C. has had a good reputation in intercollegiate\nathletics; but recently there has\nbeen a\" decline in enthusiasm\namongst I.C. students, and the\nhonour of the club has rested on\nthe shoulders of a few active\nmembers.

Steele\nHooliganism\nAre we schoolboys or grown adults ? \u2022 A lot of people tend to\nthink themselves the latter and act like the former. As was reported\nbriefly in the Late News of the last issue a student dropped the\nLibyan Embassy Parking Sign (with a concrete base) from the Tizard\nBalcony in Southside. Tins is a stupid and an extremely dangerous\nthing to do\u2014someone could have been killed, and the offender then\nprosecuted for manslaughter.. . . The offender has not revealed him-self, and those who it is rumoured know him have so far kept quiet.\nLuckily, no one was injured, but this does not alter the irresponsibility of the act, or of those who knew about it not reporting the\nincident. It is one think not to tell who poured beer down somebody else neck, but another to aid and abet an almost criminal act!\nFar too many students in this College live in their own little\nworld and care not a damn for anybody outside it. Others act as\nif they own everybody and jeo pardi se every students' freedom to live\nhis own life by participating in hooliganism. If someone does something daft, obviously members of the staff responsible, as the Senior\nWarden and the Hall Wardens, have to tighten up on discipline.\nAt the end of the last academic year there was a possibility thai\nProctors would be appointed to patrol around Southside at night;\nsurely this idea must come into force if we continue to disregard\nauthority and material property in the vicinity. If hooliganism continues we deserve to go back to school and have \" masters \" controlling us.\nThe great thing about a University is its freedom. Members of\nthe staff try to treat us as intelligent human beings and their equals.\nWe seem to think there is something wrong if we are seen frater ni sing \u2014because we were told at school that \" sucking up \" is a bad\nthing.\nThis so called \" sucking up \" is not a bad thing\u2014we can learn\na great deal from the staff, and if we were prepared to learn, the\nstaff would become more interested in us as human beings. At the\nmoment all they hear about us is rowdyism, hooliganism and irresponsibility. It is about time we took a pull on ourselves and started\nto act our age rather than like fifteen year olds.\nNo Sister\nFollowing the Government Statement on Education on the Monday of last week, I.C. will not become a SISTER as the Government\nhave decided not to proceed with their introduction. What will\nhappen to us now ? Will we become a University in our own right,\nor some kind of Technical College, or stay as we are ? The latter\nseems the most likely, with the Architectural Association joining us\nwithin five years, we will at least become a little less specialised.\ning the \"House matters of the\nUnion.\" This means that the job\nis as big as the man. The quantity of work done by the Deputy\nPresident depends very much on\nthe enthusiasm of the individual.\nWith a post as young as this it\ndoes not follow that next year's officer will see his duties in the\nsame way as Mr. Mair does.\nThis year he is dealing with\nroutine matters such as those\nlisted above and in addition many\nothers. His responsibility for\nsecurity involves, as he puts it\n\" quelling riots.\" The organisation of such yearly events as the\npancake race also fall into his\nempire.\nSTUDENT OFFICERS\nDeputy\nPresident\nStaff, furniture, catering, bar,\nbuildings, and thefts\u2014some of\nthe duties of the Union's first\nofficial dogs body. Last year the\npost of Deputy President was\ncreated. The rather dubious pleasure of holding the post for the\nfirst year to Mr. Barry Mair.\nWhen the post was created it\nwas vaguely stated to be concern\nCOMMENT\nI enjoyed seeing Iolanthe, but was somewhat disappointed by\nan exceptionally pathetic rendering of God Save the Queen at the\nbeginning. The G&S Society are, of course, far from being alone\nin perpetrating this crime. In fact, the only really outstanding version of our National Anthem that I have heard was produced by\nthe Red Army Choir and Band at the Albert Hall. There must be\na moral to this somewhere.\nHave you noticed how every time you get an urge to play a piano, they're all being used ? Well, to be frank, neither had I \u2014\nbut never fear, General Studies have! They are about increase the\nnumber of pianos in union buildings from five to six. One wonders\nwhether there aren't better ways of spending the money.\nGOLGUTT\nTO BE OR NOT TO BE\nOne or two important things seem to have *\n:\n>\neen overlooked in the recent discussion on NU.S.( such as it was). The effect of the motion passed\nat the last Union meeting is to convey to Council\nthe Union's wish to join. It is now up to Council\nto decide what steps are necessary to execute this\nwish. Although an \" act of affiliation \" will probably not have to be included in the constitution,\nrules will certainly have to be written in to cover\nthe election of representatives to the N.U.S. Conference, and possibly the election of an N.U.S. representative on Council. These changes will\nneed a two-thirds majority at two consecutive\nUnion meetings, and it' this vote is not reached\nI can see no prospect, or indeed point, in\naffiliating.\nI would be a lot happier about the whole business it I felt that there was a genuinely large\nmajority of people in College who really wanted\nto join, or for that matter, who really wanted to\nstay out. What we actually have, I'm afraid, is a genuinely large majority of people in College who\nhaven't, and don't want to have, the faintest idea\nabout the subject. This promotes the ludicrous\nsituation where one tolerably good speech at a Union meeting can, by oratory rather than in-formation, attract a ridiculously high number of\nvotes.\nReturning briefly to the point raised at the end\nof the first paragraph, the supporters of affiliation\nhave assured us that I.C. would certainly have an\neffective say in the affairs of the National Union.\nThis I doubt, but unless the vote for entry is large\nenough to prevent d is affiliation motions coming\nup for, say, the next five years\u2014we are highly\nlikely to start bouncing in and out like a yo-yo.\nIf this happens, N.U.S. will, quite rightly, not be\nvery worried about what we think.\nIt is only fair that I should conclude by saying\nwhere I stand on this issue. I am against joining\nfor mainly selfish personal reasons\u2014altruistic\nstudent politics is rather a waste of time ! Anyway, I won't be here to reap the rewards (or\notherwise) of the Union's folly (or otherwise)!\nRALLY ROUND THE FLAG, BOYS\nOne delightful example of petty bureaucracy came to my notice\nthe other day. If a sports team wins some honour that they consider merits flying the college flag, then they put in a request to Miss\nSherwood for this. This is then typed out in triplicate, one copy\nretained, one copy sent to the Rector's office, and one copy to some\nofficial in the registry.\nApproval for the great event comes from some mysterious\nsource, often less than two weeks after it has taken place, and the\nflag is duly flown (unnoticed) accompanied by a note on the Rector's board stating what is there for. If flags must be flown in this\nway, it would be a lot simpler to use the flagstaff on the Union\nbuilding, and lay down the rules ourselves.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Guildfinger\nby Brian King\nTHE FILM\nOn Sunday, 21st February,\n1965, Guilds started shooting\ntheir film in Hyde Park. The\nbattle scenes were in the can,\nwhen three park rangers arrived\non their government surplus\nbicycles, to inform Mr. Bishop\nthat he constituted a crowd.\nHowever, extraction from the impending mid den was forthcoming,\nfor pausing only to film these\nthree camera-s hv censors, and to\nbid farewell to the hundred spectators and three dogs that had\npaused on their Sunday walk, the\ncompany adjourned to Prince's Gardens. Here the chariot race\nwas filmed. The race was narrowly won by the new \" sports \"\nmodel of Mechanical 2, with its\nintrepid driver Phil \"Legs\"\nMarshall.\nChem. Eng. produced an old\ncocoa tin, containing some apparently innocuous powder.\nTwenty-eight matches caused the\nabove to precipitate ii to flame\nand thence fore the Ia.:J, and all\nthat was there unto, was girded\nabout with dense black fumes, for\na time upwards of ten minutes.\nThe film that was shot on that\nSunday has now been developed,\nand is of a high standard. The\nfinal result will be about 20 mins.\nin length, and will be shown at the\nfirst Union Meeting in the Summer Term.\nThe story of the film is as fol-lows: \u2014\nMr. Molam, a goodly man, is\nout riding in the mews with his\nlady in their new car, \" Bo.\" Suddenly they are attacked by an\nold blue van, from which leaps\nthe evil King, who steals the lady,\nand drives off.\nMr. Molam gathers up his\n\" goodies \" and gives chase in a red van. The two adversaries\nmeet in a head on collision at the\nAlbert Hall, and converse in\n\" baloo n talk.\" The only solution to the crisis is a battle, and\nso to the park for a dramatic,\nthrilling, heat palpitating punch-up, involving dustbin cannon,\nmuch smoke and flashes, and\nthree rangers on bicycles.\nThe battle is halted by a referee,\nwho suggests that a chariot race\nis a more civilised (Mechanical)\nsolution. The crowd disappears,\nand makes a ghoul-like reappearance at the start of the race. The\nevil King has meanwhile put Mr.\nMolam through the \" tortures of\nTantalus.\" The \" goodies \" win\nthe race, but again the evil King,\nsteals the lady, and drives off in\nhis Austin Martin DB6 van, only\nto be headed off by Mr. Molam\non his bike. In the ensuing\ntu ssel, Mr. Molam is thrown into\nthe Sepentine for his trouble.\nSuddenly, a hand clasping a Spanner appears through the;\nturgid water. Mr. Molam grasps\nthe weapon and finally dispatches the evil King with a cruel blow\nto the \"pate.\" Thefilmends w th Mr. Molam and his good lady\ndisappearing into the sunlight(?).\nUNION MEETING\nFor all those who would prefer some healthy fresh air and\nsunshine to a dank and dark\nlaboratory, may we recommend\nthe \" Field Cup,\" on Thursday\n11th March. This will follow the\nUnion Meeting at 1.15 pan. to be\nheld in Room 542, Mech. Eng.\nR.C& In our last news-sheet Dave Christopher raised the question of\nwhether sub sidi sing the Furzedown party was a reasonable way of\nspending the money we appear to have over this year. We've tried\nto make it clear that money is available from the union if people\nwant to do things or start clubs. Last Thursday Pete Jones came\nto the Union office after money to sub sidi sea Physics staff social\nevening. This is of wider appeal than our usual sport activities and\nit may be supported by the Union. Considering the money we spent\nchasing Theta, it seems it should be.\nTHE BAR\nIt is often said by the people to whom our entertainments and\nsport activities don't appeal, that the Union is run from the bar.\nThey can't talk to Union officers unless they drink beer in vast quan-ti ties. Of course, one gets to know people in the bar\u2014after all the\nUnion is large and you don't get far with the dinners and receptions\nwe have. What else is there for it ? We could run the Union from\nthe snack bar, but it's shut in the evenings and chaos at lunch-time.\nYou don't have to be a boozer to pass an hour in the bar, orange\nis the lunch-time drink of many. Of course, you could drop in the\nUnion office in Chemistry for coffee on Thursday lunch-times with\nyour moans and bright ideas.\nR. CJS.U. DINNER\nNext term it is planned to have a dinner for about 300 in South\nSide as well as the final year dinner later. There are rather ambitious\nideas for guest speakers. We shall see.\nAt last I.C. students are taking an interest in their Carnival.\nThe turnout for the Kensington\ncollection on the 26th was superb\nand the Carnival Committee\nwould like to thank all those\nwho came along. At the time of\nwriting we have not received\nmuch in reply, but three days\nafter the appeal was started is\nearly to judge.\nFloats and Stalls\nAre you going to do a Caraiv.il\nFloat this year ?\n. If vo u are. start thinking about\nit now, as we will want to know\nwhat length the procession will be.\nAfter the procession there is the\nfe te, so start thinking about this\nas well!\nJuke Box\nDuring the Carnival Week\nthere will be a juke box in the\ncollege\u2014where exactly, we don't know yet. Again there will be\ncoffee sales, and the Hot Dog\nstand.\nRaffle Tickets\nIn the very near future you'll be\nreceiving your raffle tickets\u2014Two\nbooks to undergraduates, one to\nPostgraduates. Try and sell as\nmany as you possibly can. As\nbefore, the raffle winners are\neligible to compete for the big\nprize, this year a Hillman Imp.\nPink Panther and 007 ?\nRumour has it that for this\nyears film festival \"The Pink\nPanther\" and \"From Russia\nwith Love \" will be shown. They\nmay be shown in the Concert Hall\nand the Lower lounge simultaneously! Helpers Wanted\nAt the moment things are going\nreasonably well, but we are still\nUNION MEETING\nThe next Union meeting will be\non 16th March. The old Theta\nis still kicking around\u2014maybe it\nshould be de-sanctified or something and put back in the Guilds\nbog whence it came. Ashes to\nashes and ball-cocks unto ball-cocks. Smith will doubtless report on ents. committee deeds and\nmisdeeds. We're about due for a Council report too methinks. I'm keeping away from that trap-door\nafter mixing up Scrutiny editor\nwith Phoenix editor in the news-sheet.\nSPORTS DAY\nOn the last Sunday of term,\n21st March, we'll be having our\nwinter sports day at Harlington.\nThe usual idea is if you normally\nplay a game, play something different this time. This gives two-left ed footed clowns with ten\nthumbs like me a chance to join in\nand enjoy ourselves. There'll be\nsoccer, mixed hockey and rug ger, maybe mixed with women in the\nscrum and only women scoring\ntries. It is hoped to have taped\nmusic and a few indoor games\na tter wards. Sign up on the lists.\nC.S. EVANS\nsuffering from a Chronic lack of\nhelpers\u2014there are only about a dozen pople who have to spend\nevery minute of their spare time\nworking for the Carnival \u2014 a ridiculous situation in a college of\n1500 undergrads alone!\nPlease can you help in some\nway\u2014even if only selling Carnival\nLunch tickets or drawing posters.\nMuch has to be done, and every\nbit of help is welcome. Come to\nthe Carnival office any lunchtime\n\u2014we'll find something for you to\ndo!\nJ. H.A. Record in\nthe can \u2014\nout April\nThis year'sI.C. Carnival record\nis IHW \" in the can \" and will be\non sale from the beginning of\nnext term.\nThe emphasis has been placed\nthis year on the quality of technical presentation. This has\nbeen made possible by the loan\nof much professional equipment\nby an Old Centralian who runs\na recording studio in London.\nAt one recent recording session\nthe value of equipment used was\nconservatively estimated to be\nabout \u00a31250. The session lasted\nten hours, at the end of which one\nthree-minute track, specially\nwritten for the record, was perfected and on tape (indicating an\nefficiency of about 0.5%?).\nOther tracks include the College war-cries, all recorded live at\nrecent Union meetings, and a live\nHootenanny recording. The whole\nis linked by an American tra-ve logue type commentary (a la\nSellers ?).\nTwelve minutes of IC sounds\nand songs, very good value for\nonly 7s.6d., and on sale from the\nen r of April.\nTERRY M.

At least, King's had little interest in the loss of their mascot on Monday morning,\n1st March. But the capture of \" Reggie \" scored the first success of\nthe year for the Wooden Horse Club.\nThe final briefing for the escapade took place the previous Thursday, when more than 30 IC'students were told their various roles.\nFew were deterred by-the early hour or bitter air. when they made\ntheir rendezvous at 7.30 a.m. by Southside entrance.\nContinued on Back Page\nby N.J. Walker After a tense and exciting match, with the result in doubt until\nthe final whistle, IC regained the U.L. U. Hockey Cup, after a lapse\nof some years, by beating West Ham Polytechnic 1\u20140 in the final\nthis afternoon at Motspur Park.\nThroughout the first half West Ham were on the attack, although\nnot looking particularly dangerous, with the occasional I.C. break-away. Indeed from one such breakaway by Hough, and a short\ncomer caused by a West Ham foul, Phillips went very close with\nhis shot.\nOn ma^y occasions it seemed that West Ham should at least\nhave a1 shot but there was always an I.C. defender on hand to tackle\nand clear. Indeed throughout the match the I.C. covering was of\nthe highest standard with all the forwards coming back to assist in\ndefence.\nAs the half went on, I.C. began to settle down and play as a team, although one felt that West Ham were in complete control.\nHalf-time\u2014No score\nStraight from the restart LC. went into the attack. There was\nfar more punch and cohesion than before the interval with the forwards\nstriking deeper into the West Ham half\u2014whose covering was not up to\nLC's standard.\nCont. on p.9. cols. 1 & 2\nSouth Side\nPIPED\nSOUNDS\nStrange sounds may currently\nbe heard echoing up and down\nthe staircases of Tizard and Selkirk Halls.

    "content": "FELIX A NIGHT AT THE OPERETTA\nMemorable lol an the The Tmpe-i al College Operatic Society's production of Gilbert\nand Sullivan's\" Iolanthe,\" put on throughout the last week of\nFebruary, seems to have been a success. Although at the start the\naudiences were not large, the last two nights saw full houses.\nAnd yet there was nothing outstanding, nothing new. Now that\nthe copyright has expired, one would have expected some attempt at\noriginality in the production, but none was made. Therefore it cannot be said that this was a memorable performance even though\nthere was no lack of vigour.\nAt last here was an orchestra that could get through the overture without sounding like a warped record. This improvement was\nundoubtedly due to it being mainly made up from our neighbours at\nRCM. It is a pity that IC cannot produce a competent orchestra on\nits own,\nThe first half of this Savoy Opera is definitely the most difficult\nto perform as it contains no catchy songs or hilarious situations.\nSome good acting or some startling innovation could have created\ninterest here. But none were forthcoming, and the first half dragged.\nThe entry of the fairies, singing \"We are dainty little fairies,\"\nevoked some laughter since they\ncould hardly have looked much\nout of place in a rugby scrum.\nThe fairy queen, Diana Crompton, made a very regal figure and\nlooked well able to cope with her\nenormous brood.\nThe appearance and transformation of Iolanthe was dramatic,\nin Ann Hay, IC has obviously\nsomeone of great talent. Unfortunately, most of the women's voices were drowned by the loudness of the orchestra, but this was\nunavoidable without an orchestra\npit. Only Susan Browne, as\nPhyllis, succeeded in defeating\nthe orchestra.\nFELIX AIRBORNE\nWho are they ? Why does\nHarlington interest them? And\nwhat is Felix doing in a toy\nplane ?\n\" They \" are members of the\nnewly formed I.C. Model Aircraft\nClub, which meets regularly at\nthat model-making mecca, Harlington, to prove that some\nBritish Aircraft really fly!\nSo, if you have a yen for Balsa\nButchery\u2014Contact Dave Gibbard\nthrough the Physics rack, or at\nRoom 3, Weeks Hall.\nA Japanese\nWestern\nOn Friday, 12th March, I.C. Film Soc. presents \" The Hidden\nFortress.\" Directed by Ahira\nKurosawa, this Japanese Western\nis set in the period of the civil\nwars between Samurai and war-lords. It tells how a princess,\na warrior and two comic peasants\nmake their way through enemy\nterritory to safe lands.\nSupporting will be \"Nuit Et\nBrouillard,\" Alain Resnais' famous documentary about Auschwitz.\nOur last film of the term will\nbe the Orson Welles epic, \" Citizen Kane.\" This will be shown\non Friday 9th March, and will be\nfollowed by the A.G.M. FLAT STREPHQN\nOf the males, Dennis Yell, as\nStrephon, was inclined to be flat\nboth in singing and acting. The\nc.i try of the peers was a more\nsober affair than that of the\nfairies, and their chorus singing\nwas excellent. The two earls,\nRichard Ault and Tony Smyth,\nperformed well throughout whereas the Lord Chancellor, Harry\nEpton, didn't really come into his\nown until the second half.\nAftc refreshment time, the\nsecond part started with a bang,\neven though Private Willis' (Chris\nHocking) musket was not loaded.\nHis soliloquy was deservedly en-cored. From then on, the audience was applauding every num-ber, and the cast could do no\nwrong.\nThe Lord Chancellor and the\ntwo earls made some amusing\nantics which were well received,\nand everybody looked as is they\nwere enjoying themselves. The\nfinal chorus, with the. whole cast\non stage, was impressive, and for\nonce the orchestra was nearly\ncompletely drowned. Some of the\npeers must be congratulated on\nbeing actually able to lift some of\nthe fairies for the finale.\nEven if this was not a memorable production of \" Iolanthe,\"\nat least it was an enjoyable one.\nIt is the end that we remember\nlongest, and.the end was good. So\nperhaps next year there will be\nfull houses every night of the week\ninstead of just the final two nights.\nPETER COMBES\nin ts Electronic engineers, designers, system planners and\nmanufacturers of aeronautical, broadcasting,\ncommunications and maritime radio equipment,\ntelevision, radar and navigational aids\non land, at sea and in the air.\nTHE MARCONI COMPANY LIMITED CHELMSFORD X20\n\n"

Oh, no, Sir\\ We maintain a keen\ninterest in current affairs, and active social conscience, and a healthy\ncontempt for science.\nOnly the other month one of us read a newspaper. We noticed\nthat the conditions for entry to University was a matter for public\nconcern. Whereupon we decided that it was our moral duty to investigate the problem at IC. Has it not been stated, by no lesser person\nthan Lord Robbin Somebody, that \" No door should be left unopened\nto the qualified student?\"\nSo we carried out a survey on doors\u2014external doors, that is.\nFor we considered that more students would come to College, if only,\nin the confusion of the morning after, they could negotiate the current\ncomplex of closed glass doors.\nOur results tell a sorry tale. The\nChemistry Department, with four\nexternal doors, has only one\nopening in each direction. Exactly\nsimilar is the behaviour of the\nfour doors on the north side of\nthe Mech Eng Building. Outside\nthe Physics Block, we observed,\none unfortunate fellow try twelve\ndoors in a row and then fall\nscreaming and frothing on the\nground; we pacified him and\nhelped him into a ventilator shaft.\nThus, we deplore the difficulty\nof entry into IC Departments, and\nwould recommend to frustrated\nentrants that they apply to the\nUniversity of Accra, which, it is\nreported, has no doors at all.\nYours openly,\nROY CLARKE,\nDAVID C. LARBALESTIER,\nROGER LHARKER,\n(Metallurgy Dept. RSM)\nP.S. \u2014We regret to report that\nduring the survey, D.C. Larbalestier was scissor ed by two invisible\nglass doors. Fruit and flowers to\nHammersmith Hospital, please.\nLandladies\nDiscriminate\nDear Sir,\nIn your last issue Chris Lampard in his \" Foreign Affairs \"\ncolumn, mentioned that students\nat Oxford had conducted a survey\nof landladies, and found that 62\nper cent, discriminate against\nAfrican and Asian students. He\nWonders what a similar survey in\nLondon would reveal.\nHis question is a good one. No\nsuch survey has ever been conducted in London, so far as I can\ndiscover.\nThe University of London\nLodgings Bureau sometime ago\ncounted the proportion of their\nlandladies who were known to\ndiscriminate, and found this was\n25 per cent. The real figure is\nalmost certainly more.\nLast term an I.C. lodgings\nbureau was run by Miss Goodchild at the Domestic Bursar's Office. She tells me that out of\n60 landladies, 54 discriminated;\nshe only succeeded in finding accommodation for 6 out of 52\ncoloured students who applied to\nher.\nThe work involved in conducting a survey of landladies is\nenormous and one wonders\nwhether it is worth the effort for\nit is not possible to re-educate\nlandladies on their doorsteps.\nThe l.C. Society for Racial\nEquality has just received the\nRegistrar's permission to conduct\na survey of the coloured students\nat I.C. to find out: \u2014\n(1) The extent of disc rim in a tion.\n(2) // they find it a serious\nproblem.\n(3) Suggestions for constructive\nstudent action.\nWe have already conducted a pilot survey. I should like to\ntake this opportunity to ask the\nstudents concerned to cooperate\nin answering the question aire that\nthey will soon receive.\nYours faithfully\nROY CLARKE\n(Hon. Sec. ICSFRE)\nCongratulations\nSir,\nImperial College Union is to be\ncongratulated on disproving its\ncritics; not only was last Thursday's meeting quo rate, but quite\ndecisively we agreed to join N.U.S. It is to be hoped that the Executive will make an immediate application so that I.C. membership\ncan take effect from the Easter\nCouncil of N. US. This raises the\nquestion of delegates and aN.U.S. Secretary; I suggest that\nthese be elected from a Union\nGeneral Meeting or by a College\nballot.\nThis was a democratic decision\nof the Union, and the counter-moves of two years ago that\nfrustrated and discredited the\nUnion must not be allowed to re-occur.\nYours etc.,\nSEAN DUNNE,\n(Physics P.G.) Dear Sir,\nIn your edition of February 24th you drew the attention of\nyour readers for the second time this year your feelings and some of\nyour thoughts about Sennet, the newspaper of the University of\nLondon. As some of your facts are suspect, perhaps you would allow\nme to point out one or two things which you should know.\nIn your editorial you mention sensationalism and you will remember that in previous editorials you have complained of this\nsensationalism being directed at unfortunate topics. If, as you seem\nto suggest, you think sales are the only criteria of the success of a newspaper, then Sennet is by all standards successful.\nThe Sennet Board of Governors has laid down a policy of the\npaper and any editor is required to abide by this policy. As to\nthe Board badgering Sennet, I think you will find that they have\ntaken an interest in the paper but have certainly not interfered in any\nway with the Editor's proper functions. Neither have they changed\ntheir minds.\nYour comments concerning staff and organisation were both\nobvious and trite. If you, Sir would release some of your staff to work\nin Imperial College for Sennet I am quite sure the editor, who is\nresponsible through the Managing Director to the Board for all staff,\nwould be only too delighted. When you say the editor should be\nappointed for a year, I would point out that Mr. Marsden left of his\nown free will, Miss Roll's appointment was not ratified by the Board,\nwho together with the Presidents' Council supported my action, which\nwas taken on the basis of a previous decision of Council, and Mr.\nWade to Whom we were most grateful could only for personal reasons\nbe editor for five issues.\nI trust that this clarifies some of your misconceptions and ir,\nclosing I would like to point out that Sennet has sold mer the first\n12 issues this year, an average of 1000 copies per week at Imperial\nCollege, Also it is not my intention to comment on your remark i concerning myself, because, Sir, logic appears to be one of your\nweaker points.\nYours faithfully,\nANTHONY J. BERRY,\n(President of ULU)\nEd.\u2014I have approached various members of the Felix Staff;.none\nare prepared to work for Sennet!\nSir,\nPrice\nVindicated\nDear Sir,\nIt seems to me that in reporting\nthe proceedings of the last Union\nmeeting you were not aware of\nthe real reason behind Mr. Price's action in vacating the chair and\nsubmitting his gown to Deputy\nPresident Barry Mair. To say\nthat Mr. Price's chairing was poor\nis wholly untrue; the fact is that\nthe President took this action to\ndefend himself against challenges\nand allegations from the fl lo or. As Kearns withdrew his motion\nPrice did not subsequently speak.\nYours etc.,\nGEORGE BARAMKI\n(Physics I) Frustrated\nNew Atlas\nDear Sir,\nMr. Roy Clarke's ignorance of\nSouthern Africa is nicely illustrated by his incorrect description of\nthe territory between the Limpopo\nand Cape Agulhas as South\nAfrica.\nIf this Philistine is to continue\nas the Secretary of ICSFRE, then\nyou might at least let him share\nMr. Lampard's proposed new\natlas.\nYours sincerely,\nGRAHAM CLARKE\nDear Sir,\nIt was found impossible to advertise the Huxley Society's meeting of Tuesday 23rd February on\nthe Events Board in the Union\nbecause, apparently, Stan had run\nout of letters to do so.\nPerhaps a\" more letters for\nStan \" fund might do something\nto ease the situation?\nYours faithfully,\nJ.
