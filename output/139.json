    "content": "FELIX Michael Ian Callow, President\nel eot of the Royal School of Mines,\nreceived his earlier education at King's College School and came to Mines to\ncomplete his academic career as a Mineral\nDresser. Cricket and Squash were his\nmain sporting interests at school, but\nnow a mature Ian follows more normal extra\naural activities as well. Indeed, when\ninvited to parties, he has been known to\narrive at 3.30 a.m. unashamedly explaining\nthat he was delayed having 'one for the\nroad'.\nIan has understandably strengthened\nAnglo-Canadian relations as a result of\nbis stay in that country this year.\nWe would, however, note that immediate\npast presidents have become married\nduring, or soon after, their term of\noffice.\nIan's association with Mines is of\nlonger standing than many think, sino e it was a group of Minesmen who gave Ian\nhis first hangover in North Wales five\nyears ago. From strength to strength\nhe has gone and today he is capable of\nlooking as pink-eyed as the next.\nM.I. Callow, the President of Mines,\nis five feet eleven and three quarter inches\nof solid London manhood. He is quiet,\nmodest,eff io i ent, very likeable and\nendowed with the capacity to make others\nwork. This latter asset will ensure the\ngood working of the Union. Wherever\nMinesmen are gathered Ian will he found\nthere giving all branches of the College's activities his full support.\nThis is our President - Ian Callow.\nCOMMENTARY\nThere are primarily two serious\nmistakes wh i oha journal, of anything\nbut a frivolous nature, must not make if it is to command the respect of its existing and potential readers; it must\nat all times present both, sides of the\nargument, and in the event of only one\nside being presented for any reason it must print \"The truth, the whole truth\nand nothing but the truth\". The first does not apply if the journal is openly\nand honestly affiliated to any political\nparty or organisation of persons of like\nviews, but the second applies to every\npublication, including student news*\npapers.\nI make this point, which is, I feel,\nof paramount importance, because if the\nreader will cast his mind back exactly\ntwo weeks he will recall that Pelix\nfeatured upon the back page of its^last\nissue an article upon the World\nUniversity Servioe (W.U. S.) That the\nlatter la a worthy cause, no one who\nMO UNTA1NEERING\nThe Mountaineering Club was formed\nin 1929 with the active support of\nProfessor CI. Finch and Mr. G.W. Young.\nTen years later a keen group from the\nblu b proposed and helped to form the\nUniversity of London Mountaineering\nClub. Apart from a few years during\nthe War the club has been continually\nprogressing with the increasing popularity of mountaineering.\nThe object of the dub is \"the\nencouragement of all farms of Mountaineering among the students and staff\nof the Imperial College\". To realise\nthis object the support of experts as\nwell as beginners is essential. In\nrecent years the standard of climbing\nhas been very high and, with a large\nnucleus of members who gained valuable\nexperience last year, this coming year\nshould prove no exception.\nAnticipating an increased interest in this fine sport, the o lub has\nprepared a more extensive programme.\nLuring the term three meets will be\nheld in North Wales as well as Sunday\nvisits to the sandstone out ar ops near\nTunbridge Wells. Illustrated\nlectures on aspects of mountaineering\nwill also be given this term.\nHoliday meets in Glenooe and The Lakes\nand a full-scale Alpine meet next\nsummer are being planned.\nAvailable to members i a A large\namount of equipment including tents,\nrope, ice-axes, cramp on s and a collection of rock-o limb lng guides.\nPeople often ask themselves the\nquestion: Why do men climb mountains?\nThe only satisfactory way of answering\nthis is to experience mountaineering\nin all its aspects, the main ones of\nwh i oh are: hill walking, rook climbing and snow and ice climbing. These\nin combination or separately can be\npracticed by joining the mountaineering club. The club will welcome\nenquiries from potential mountaineers\nwith or without experience who wish\nto enjoy mountaineering and the social\nlife that is an integral part of it. THE FRESHER'S MEET\nThe popularity of mountaineering and the need of a change from\nLondon was shown by the fact that over\nsixty students finally arrived at\nLlyn Ogwen early on Saturday 24th November.\nOgwen was chosen because of the\nabundance of climbs wh i oh are not too\ndifficult in any conditions and which\nprovide an excellent introduction to\nthe art of rock climbing.\nEven though it rained all Saturday a number of keen members did\nroutes on Tryfan, Idwal Slabs and\nGlogwyn y Bustaoh. On Sunday ao old wind had taken the pla oe of the\ntorrential rain but many more people\nwent out and visited the cliffs of\nGlyder Fach, Booblwyd Buttress and\nGreigeau Dena in addition to the ones\npreviously mentioned.\nIt is interesting to note that\nnearly all freshmen did some rook\nclimbing, in some oases seconding\nsevere s and taking into account the\nconditions this was a very successful fresher s meet.\nex cerci ses his mind will dispute, but\nthe essential point of the article was\nwhether or not money raised by Imperial\nCollege from the student body should be\ndonated to W.U. S. It required a person\nof no more than average intelligence to\nrealize that only one side of the argument was presented and that the crucial\npoints were no more than fiction, thereby rendering Felix guilty cf the above\ntwo errors.\nFor the information of the reader,\nthe crux of the matter is that the\nImperial College Union Council decided\nthat not all the Union's energy would\nbe diverted towards the W.U. S.1960 Carnival for, in addition, I.C.U. would organise its own Carnival during\n1960. Luring the W.U. S.1959 Carnival the I.C.U. raised \u00a3600 and\nit is, therefore, not,unreasonable to\nexpect the same amount or slightly\nmere (due to the geographical advantage)\nto be raised by an I.C.U. Carnival\nwhere the profits would not be\nappropriated to erase the loss\nincurred by the efforts of the other\nLondon Colleges, as was the case last\nyear. In the Feb. 13th1959 issue\nof Felix (page 1) it was Stated that\nthe cost of an Imperial College Bed\nin St. George's Hospital would be\n\u00a31,000, or the equivalent spread\nover a number of years; for instance,\n.\u00a3200 p.a. for 5 years, the Bed being\ninstalled upon the receipt by the\nHosDital of the first \u00a3200.\nIf the gentlemen who spoke 30\nvehemently at the last I.C. Union\nMeeting had engaged their talent\nUpon a little basic arithmetic they\nwould have arrived at the conclusion\nthat \u00a3600 and \u00a3200 are not one and the\nsame thing. They do in fact differ\nby \u00a3400 and it is this latter sum\nthat the I.C.U. Council assumed would\nbe denoted to W.U. S. in1960. If the\nI.C.U. decides to support W.U. S. it is not re jeo ting the decision of the\n'58-'59 Council, it is merely increasing the fears of many members of the\nUnion that we have this Session a superfluous number of \"talkers\" ana\ntoo few \"workers\". I sould suggest\nthat a mare suitable equation than\nW.U. S.+I.C.*? for this year's policy would be\nW.U. S.+ Energy - Politios = W.U. S.+ St. G \u00bb\nENGINEERING SOCIETY VISIT to PARIS.\nDuring Easter Vao: 26th March - 2nd April. Travel by plane.\nOverall cost \u00a316, Limited places\navailable.

However, some\nnine days and 2,000 miles later, having\ntravelled via Paris, Lisbon and\nMadeira, we sighted Santa Maria, the\nfirst of the islands, of wii ah there\nare nine in all, the remainder being\nSao Miguel, Teroeixa, Graoiosa, Sao\nJorge, Pico, Fayal, Flores and Corvo.\nIt was then that we realized that\nPlato's idea of Atlantis, the drowned\nContinent, was perhaps not quite so\n>far feto he d_as we had hitherto imagined,\nfor these mysterious volca nio islands\nwhich suddenly appear out of the grey\nAtlantic mists have provided the basis\nof the islands of Geltio folklore and\nexplorers have spoken of an enchanted\nis lew hi oh\"...... was said to exist on the distant confines of the West and appear,\nevery seven years or so, to 3ea men ploughing its waters ..... Shores\nshrouded in mist, cradles rooked by\nthe swell, spellbound oasis reserved\nfor those who could break the spells\nthat encompassed it. Although geologists discount all theories that the Azores are the remains of a sunken continent, the islands\nstill retain their mystery, for their\nblack basaltic cliffs, rising vertically from the watery depths are\nclothed in rich green sub-tropical\nvegetation, and volca nio peaks, with\nsulphurous fumes still emanating from\ntheir crater lakes, are still a source\nof wonder and fear to the total\npopulation of 300,000 who originated\nmainly from Portugal and Flanders in the 15th. Century.\nThe expedition consisted of one\ngeologist who also acted as a surveyor,\nan aeronautical engineer as the equipment officer, a. physicist as the\nphotographer, a botanist, and five\nzoologists, and the object was to\nconduct a survey of the underwater\nfauna, flora and geology around the\nshores of the island of Teroeira.\nConsequently, during the seven weeks\nfor wh i oh we were resident on the .\nisland, each day was spent diving in the clear blue waters which formed\npart of the Gulf Stream, mapping and\ncollecting specimens from the sea- -bed. The underwater life was breathtaking for one accustomed to diving\nin the cold grey waters around the\nU.K., but, at the same time, i too ul d \"be A little dangerous for the unwary\nfor Moray Eels,\" Sting Hays, and Portugese Men-o War were plentiful and the\nconsequences of an unexpected encounter with them extremely unpleasant.\nBarracuda were numerous but gave us\nno trouble, whilst the sharks which\nwere not infrequent appeared to be mare\nafraid of we invaders in their world\nthan vice-versa.\nWe found the Asoreana extremely-hospitable people and whilst we did\nnot master their language we did in crease their slender knowledge of the\nEnglish tongue. For instance, one\nyoung fisherman is now capable of\nstating, with a perfect Oxford accent,\nthat \"My umbrella has been struck b v. lightning\", followed quickly by \"Go.\nIhome Tanks\" and \"Don't mention it, 'old boy\",\nAs the reader will doubtless\nimagine, their was a little pleasure\ncombined with the work, and towards\nthe end of the visit six members spent\nseveral days travelling around some of\nthe other islands of the group. The\nisland of Pico was visited and climbed\n(0,000 feet} from sea-level to a ea~ level by three members in nine hours,\nand also Fayal where the geologist\nnearly collected his last s pe oi men in the crater of a still-active volcano,\nand where the only woman in the party,\nClaire Brooks, who, incidentally has\nnow become engaged to one of the other\nmembers, s hooked the locals by gathering tape worms from the stomach of a putrefying whale.\nEncamped in a vineyard, we did\nnot, needless to say, encounter any\nlack of fresh fruit, and indeed, fed\nextremely well during our stay, being\nable to catch as much fish as we\nrequired and supplementing it from\nour store of tinned goods, with an\noccasional octopus which only one\nmember of the party appeared to\nappreciate.\nFinding from previous experience,\nwhen our equipment had been held by\nthe customs officials for over a week,\nthat the only way to get past any\ngovernment official was to bribe him.\nwe gave a party before our departure\nto all the local officials whom we felt oo ul d facilitate our progress\nthrough the maze of rod tape. We\nnot only succeeded in persuading half\nthe city officials to go for a swim\nin the harbour in the early hours of\nthe morning but must be among the first to leave the islands in the governor's launch and, in addition, not pass\nthrough the customs house. We left behind us, therefore, a strong impression of the mad English, stories\nof foreign bullfighters who had no\nhealthy respect for the bull, and\nseveral Portugese palates keenly^\nas Justed'to the ban t Scottish whisky.\nThe reader will, or should, ask\nhimself \"Was the expedition a success?\"\nTes, for back at I.C. work is now r, going ahead on all the specimens and\nit is hoped that the results will be\npublished, while there is still a oha no e that there will be a30 minute\nfilm on T.V. together with an article\nin the Sunday Times.\nFinally, the members of the Expedition would like to thank all those\nmembers of the Union and the Staff,\nespecially the Exploration Board, who\nin any way gave assistance during the\nmonths of preparation and without\nwhose help the expedition would not\nhave been possible.\nR.H. T.G. BEAUTICWAR1AN\nNo.2. ANNE WHITEHOUSE\nDEBATING\nI.C. the holders of the Intercollegiate debating cup met Kings\nCollege in the first round of this years\ntournament on Friday 16th Deo. in the\nupper refectory.\nIt is a bad thing that such a successful team should have 30 little support from the members of the Union,\nfor just as in the final last year there\nwere only two I.C. supporters present,\nso on Friday the first round was\ndebated before a mere 16 people.\nThree members of last years successful team are still at I.C. and so the\nI.C. side showed only one change in its lino up. The motion 'That the voting\nage should be lowered to 18' was proposed by John Loome for I.C. in a speech\nwhich although effective was well below\nhis'best. He outlined the general\nsubstance of the propositions case\nby showing how the age of 21 was an\narb it ary limit for the franchise to be\ngranted and further showing that 18 was\na logical choice of a new limit.\nBob Finch elaborated the theme by\narguing that emotionally and ph y sio ally a person was as developed at eighteen as\nat twenty one. The only thing an eighteen year old lacks is experience.\nMr. Chandmal took the line that if one\nwas obliged to fight for ones country at\neighteen, if ones crimes could be punish\npunished at eighteen as an adult, it was\nmorally just for an eighteen year old to\nhave a say in the government of his\noo un try. To be unable to help decide\nthe Nation's policy and yet to fight for\nit was unjust.\n\n"

    "content": "GLIDING\nMidday of a sunny July Sunday found\nas lasted in the cockpit of Phoenix, tha\nI.O. O.C. Skylark II sail plane, having\njust oas t off fro a a somewhat bumpy aerO-te w behind an ancient Tiger Moth. Soaring conditions were quite good, and I coon found quite a reasonable thermal\nwh i oh gave about 7 fps of lift, after a bit of coaxing. Climbing in smooth,\nstrong, thermals is a relatively relaxing process, and I had plenty of time to\no on side r the next move. I have taken off\nfrom Lanham 10 minutes previously, having\ndeclared Nympsfield as my goal, on the\nadvice of Prank Irving. I wanted to do\na oros soo un try flight of more than 50k.m. in order to qualify for the third and\nlast leg of my silver C certificate, and\nas Roger Vaile, the I. C.G.C. captain, had\ncompleted his own silver C the previous\nweek, I was reasonably determined to\nsucceed. There was very little wind\nblowing and so from that point of view\nthe direction of flight was unimportant.\nThe Nympsfield direction had the two advantages that there was only one airway\nto worry about, and that the country was\ngood, both as a source of thermals, and\nfar landing in. Hympsfield itself is cradles W NW of Lasham, and is the home\nsite of the Bristol Gliding Club. It is situated on top of a ridge overlooking\nthe Severn and Stroud valleys.\nI followed my first thermal up to\naloud base at 5\u00bb0OO \u00bb, and as conditions\nseemed good, I decided to press en* without delay. There was a promising cloud\nabout a mile away in the right direction,\nand so I headed straight for it, putting\nthe speed up to 55 knots so as to get\nout of the intermediate sink as qui ok ly as possible. I lost about 1,000' in flying to this cloud, but there was a good thermal underneath it, as I had\nhoped, and I worked this one back up te\ncloud base. The clouds themselves were\ntoo small to make worthwhile any attempt\nat entering them in the hope of finding\nstronger life, and in any case my experience of cloud flying was ( and is) so\nlimited that suo h an attempt would probably have made me airsick.\nI proceeded in this way, hopping\nfrom cloud to o loud, and covered about\n20 miles in the first hour. My first obstacle then appeared in the form'of the\nGreen One airway, which runs in an EastWest direction and is about 5 miles wide.\nGliders are not encouraged to loaf\naround in airways and so I out directly\nacross it by flying due North, all the\ntime keeping .well clear of clouds with\ntheir possible lurking airliners. In\nso doing I lost a lot of height and by\nthe time I was clear of the airway I waa\ndown to about 1,500'. Fortunately I was directly above a disused R.A.F. aerodrome, and I was thus: Ibis to concentrate an finding lift. Otherwise I would have had to keep one eye open for\npossible landing fields, and in the resulting confusion I would probably have\ncome unstuck and had to land. However,\nI was lucky and found a good thermal\nwh i oh soon had me bao k at 5 , 0 0 0 ' . Far\nthe next two hours I flew fairly leisurely\nalong the northern edge of Salisbury\nPlain, flying over Brise Norton, Little Rissington, Cheltenham, and ending up\nover Gloucester.\n.My map she wed Nympsfield to be\nabout 12 miles to the south, but I didn't know exactly where the site was, and it had the reputation of being difficult to find from the air. The visibility had\nbeen excellent up till then, affording a magni fi oie nt view for about 50 miles in each direction, but with the approach\nof evening it was rapidly worsening, and\nI couldn't see far more than about 5 miles.\nIn the meantime a headwind of about 5 knots\nhad sprung up from the S.W, and an ugly-looking sea breeze front had formed about\ny miles to the south. Sea breese fronts\nmake the air in between themselves and the\n. r ix nc\"c a aM very1 lUb le and hence oom pl eVe J Ly unsuitable for' soaring.\nHowever, I fumbled about for an hour\nant. a half in the front itself, where\nthere were a few weak thermals, and ended\nup about 3 miles N.W. of where I hoped\nNympsfield was. After a long s or uti ay of my map I had finally de oid edit could\nbe on one of several nearby ridges when\nto my Joy I spied a distant Tiger Moth\nland on one of them. Further inspection\nshe wed two gliders parked outside a hanger, the sun glinting on their wings.\nThis o on firmed that it was in fao t my\ngoal, but 1 wasn't sure if I had enough\nheight to get there. However,.by thermal had petered out, and as there didn't seem to be any others nearby, I decided\nto press on regardless. There were several fields in the Stroud Valley into\nwh i ohIo ou ld have landed in the event\nof not reaching it. However, fortune favoured the Bold,\nand I ran into 'a thermal wh i oh, although\nweak, gave me ample- height to reach my\ngoal. I was thus able to enjoy a few\nminutes of pleasant relaxation, s it ting back in bovine content and admiring\nthe magnificent view over the Severn\nestuary.\nAfter a very high and wide Air\", oui t,al aB.0.A.C,I finally landed at\n1730, after 5^ hours of decidedly hard\nwork. I waa given a very warm welcome,\nand more-to the point, a good cup of\ntea. The first job was te phone back\nto Lasham and it was decided to send out\na private aeroplane (a Miles Messenger)\nto tow me back. The return flight took\nabout 50 minutes and was most enjoyable\non a ooo unt of the by now excellent visibility and the very smooth air which\nmads aero-towing such easier.\nBaok at Lasham I found that it had been a very good day for gliding,\nand both Frank Irving and Paul Minton\nhad separately flown their Skylark III\naround a100 k.m. triangle at a very\nhigh speed indeed.\nThe day ended, as was inevitable,\nwith a long session in the Lasham bar,\nand this I think is a good place to\nstop.\nDavid Ashford\nVice Captain, 1C.&C. HOPMANSHIP\nA depressing truth must by now,\nhave be oom e apparent to every socially\nminded fresher. This is that selection\nof a really suitable female at a oo lle ge dance is by no means an easy matter.\nThe reason for this is the eleven to\nfour man to woman ratio la the\nUniversity, a Senate House-inspired plot\nwhich is painfully evident on entering\nthe cook-pit of a oo lle ge hop.\nWith this urgent problem in view a handy little booklet \"The Woman for You\"\noy A. Hopman (Nosuoh Publishers Ngns.)\nhas recently been published as a guide\nto the frustrated student. In it the\nauthor, who submits an interesting\npersonal record of having defended\nallegations of abduction, seduction;\nbreach of promise, legal paternity and\nliability as co-respondent as an\nindication of his authority in the\ngentle art, draws upon a 'mine of experience to compile a code of practice for\ncollege dances. The whole strategy is unfolded in this priceless volume, but\nfor the benifit of those who cannot *\nafford the book, or whose self -con cio us ness would not allow them to be\nseen reading it, the essence of it is given here.\nThe first task on arriving at the\ndance is to inspect the prey, opposition,\nand the terrain, i.e. the women, men and\ntheir distribution, both in number and\nposition. Usually the women will be\nsitting around the%aides (apparently\nengrossed in chatter, but watching you\nas dearly as you are sizing up them,\nmake no mistake) and the men will be\njam-packed into a few square yards at\none end of the floor, also talking and\nwat oh ing( the women). If the organ iS\" era have done a good job the numbers\nshould be about even.\nThe next job is to make a close,\nbut, unobserved, surveillance of the\nfemale element, noting any particular lv acceptable pieces \u00abf. beauty, .this-is best\ndone by strolling the length of the\nfloor, as unconcernedly as pos sT t sew After extensive de vel ppe ment of observatory powers, and much practice, it sho\nshould be possible to deo ide whether to\nremain or to repair to the Bar. The\nbeginner, however, will now probably\nhave noticed about a dozen pretty faces,\nseveral pairs of shapely legs, and\nperhaps ten body assemblies worthy of\nfurther investigation.' If he is lucky,\nin two or three cases one of each of\nthese will all belong to the same girl, and the game is on.\nNow to make an aq quaint ance. Here\nis where the first signs of opposition\nat pear.. That z rou io of men standing,\nnear her, who seem to have not the\nfaintest notion that she exists* have\nalready noticed what you have seen. Aa\nsoon as the next dance i3 announced the\nthere will be a simultaneous dash to\ngobble her up. Here you must decide\nwhether she is worth a momentary loss of\ndignity. Assuming she is, and that you\nwin the race, you have about ten minutes\n- until the M.C. calls 'Next Dance\nplease' - to find out whether she really\nis what you want. This obviously'\ndepends on what you are, in fact,\nlooking for, and the author a e votes fourteen chapters to methods afi\ndiscovering if she is. Such detail\ncannot be attempted here, but the main\nfact is to remember to avoid wasting\ntime on the 'Do you come here often?\nWhat college do you oom e from? Do you\nlike the band?' roundabout. This is\nnot to suggest, though, that you enquire\nwhether she is an advocate of free love;\nat least, not until you are sure of your\nfooting.. During the course of the dance you\nare advised to keep an eye out for any\nmore agreeable merchandise you may so\nfar have missed. Do this with regard\nto the third finger of the left hand\nwhich is, happily, held in a prominent\nposition when dancing. This will\nprevent future disillusionment.\nSo the dance ends and you must\nmake a snap decision whether to lure her\nby offering her a drink, or to try else-where. This is the focal point Of the\nevening. If you think she is worth\nhaving, you may be surprised to find she\ndoesn't feel the same about you, and\nwill \"Have to go bao k to a friend\".\nDon't offer to go as well, or she may be\nfor oed to spell out the invitation to\nget lost. On the other hand. if_ she a eee pta, you may regret that gin and\norange when you learn later that she-lives at. Watford.\nOne happy evening-, though, you will\nfind that she only drinks orange squash,\nand lives no further than Earl's Court.\nThen you can be sure that you have truly\ndeveloped the art of HbpmanshipL_\n\n"

With\nthe best will in the world one cannot\ndescribe this latest feat of fe mino multiplication as a sporting achievement;\nis it then as a landmark in the history\nof the College that we are to regard it?\nIt has long been a cherished custom\nto bewail the lack of beautiful young\ngirls at I.C., and to while away lectures\nby conjuring up visions of hundreds of\nlovely maidens to sooth the brow and\ndelight the eye. This used to be a perfectly safe pastime. Nobody\nenvisaged any actual change in the\nstatus quo, and consequently no thought\nwas devoted to what the results of su oha change might be. We are now reaping\nthe harvest of this negligence. Like\nmany a scientific experiment, alas,\nlarge discrepancies are developing\nbetwixt theory and experiment. It is\nbeing brought home that while 40 or so\nwomen are distractions,and just about\ntolerable as such, any increase forms\nan incalculable menace to all that we\nhold nearest and dearest. With\nincreasing vigour will the perennial\nsqueaks of \"Why can't we oom e in the\nBar?\" be s quo ken. With increasing s est will the bright young things disfigure\ntheir anatomies and the view with\nhideous garments of fluorescent hue (an\nextremely bright red pair of stockings\nhas neon be daz a ling the precincts of\nlate).

My reasons are;-1) There are frequently two people\nwaiting for it.2) The majority of Foreign Students seem\nto prefer it.3) It is a serious paper which cannot\nsatisfactorily be quickly glanced\nthrough and this adds to the shortage.\n4) It has long ceased to be a predominantly regional paper and is now\nthe only serious paper wh i oh claims to\nbe radical.\nWhich Committee is responsible\nfor the supply of papers, and will it plea a e correct the shortage?\nTours faithfully,\nJ.P.

On the day of the l st Guild's Union meeting, a combination of lack\nof foresight by the Guild's President,\nand a smartly executed plan by a group\nof R.C.S., resulted in the Spanner\ngoing southwards, and not to the Union\nmeeting. A somewhat surprised Jolyon\nWove was left seated in the road shouting\n\u2022Guilds, Guilds;Hill \" in rather pathetic\ntones.\nRather upset at having lost their\ntreasured mascot, a large percentage\nof -be Guilds' Union Meeting went\nround to Weeks Hall to try, in a vain attempt, to recover it. Mr.\nForstar, President of S.C. S., waa then\ninvited to visit the Guilds Union but\nas he was in the middle of an important\n'ladies' meeting found it Impossible\nto accept.\nThe Spanner, now suitably bede oke d in R.C.S. colours, then went on-a trip\nto the South Downs. A series of ol u es led the pursuers past such famous spots\nas Rodean School, an ancient Monaster*,\nWEEKS HALL SIEGE a mental Establishment, and picking up\nthe last due at the village Inn, arrived\nat a ring of trees in the middle of no-where. Meanwhile towards the end of\nthe Guilds Union Meeting, a rumour was\ncirculated that the spanner was now in residence in the middle of the Bound\nPond.\nLed by a rather pur tur bed President, a band of Guildsmen wondered\nover to Kensington Gardens. The\ndee oy Spanner, a sherry bottle in Guilds colours, was nowhere to be seen,\nso the Guilds President for want of\nexercise (he said later) swam out\nto what turned out to be an upturned\ntable. We are pleased to announce\nthat the fish he o aught during his\nepic swim, won Third Prize in the\nLower Wopping fishing contest that\nwas taking place at the same time.\nMorphy Day, essentially the\nofficial I.C. Bag Bay, due to the\nconsiderable amount of damage that\nhad occurred in previous years had\ntaken on a new look. , Instead of the\ndour do or die defence of the Tow\nPath Bridge, the constituent Colleges\nhad agreed to wage battle over a rubber\ntyre on a part of the Tow Path well\naway from Boat Houses and people.\nThe College winning the tyre (i.e. holding it when the Lowry Boats passed)\nwould then be presented with the other\nColleges mascot.\nAfter nearly half an hours fighting,\nthe tyre was Guilds, and although a few\nR.C.S. man fought on, the rest trouser less, muddy, and a little dejected swayed the\nvice president of R.C.S.' s opinion and\nMr. Green conceded victory to Guilds.\nLater that evening the thermometer\nwas presented to the Guilds president,\nunknown to the Guildsmen, R.C.S. had\nplotted to recapture Theata, and two\nplans had been prepared. As it happened,\na much simpler opportunity arose, and\nperhaps the finest piece of mascot\nremoval resulted in the thermometer\nreturning to R.C.S. hands in twenty\nminutes.' To fill in the details, an\nR.C.S. Fresher walked into the dinner\nwith the main Guilds party, sauntered\nbehind the top table, removed the at a and walked out the other door-way!\nThursday saw the last of the\nB.C.S. Freshers Dinner, and Guildsmen\nin force, made the Union building\ncrowded. The evening began with an\nunsuccessful attempt to remove the\nR.C.S. President, and so the Guildsmen\nremoved to Queens for a Council of War.\nThe Dinner was of a very high standard\nand made ewen higher by the presence of\na large proportion of the ladies of the\nCollege.\nDeciding on their plan of campaign,\nGuilds returned to Union Bar, and packed\nit almost to capacity. Picking on the\nofficials of the S.C. S. Union first of\nall, Guilds soon had a trouser less Mr.\nEdwards singing to them. When Mr.\nForster returned to the Union, after\nchanging (premonition?) his Kangella\nJOURNEY'S END\nwas well received and after he had fin-is he d, despite his struggles he was\nremoved to Stonehenge where he was\ndeposited barefoot.\nThe triumphant President, returned\nto Weeks Hall in the early hours of\nFriday, and recounted his almost\nin or edi ilo us return to I.C.

Apparently draft\ncopies are already in circulation to\nthose in the know and from the information available, secured from reliable\nsources, it seems probable that the\nfollowing recommendation will be made.\nAll parental contributions to grants\nwill be abolished, and the necessary\nmeans test will cease to exist. This\nstep has been a dvo oat ed by the majority\nof students for many years, and should\na bill to this affect pass through the\nHouse, students will welcome it, and\nenjoy the greater independence that\nshould be the outcome.\nIt is very interesting to consider\nthe possible and even probable steps\nwh i oh will follow. The University\nAuthorities have long been trying to\ndiscourage students from taking on\ngeneral manual work during the vacations.\nShey want the 52-week academic year.\nThe National Union of Students, in policy and opinion, agrees with this\nviewpoint, and is therefore pressing\nfor the grant increase necessary to\nenable students to live oom fort ably throughout the year, without having\nto accept parental help, or having to\nresort to well-paid labour ing jobs.\nOf o our se such proposals oo ul d not go forth without any ties, and the\nN.U.S. agrees that under the above\nconditions, the students should be\ngiven compulsory va oat ional academic\nwork, to be handed in or examined after\nthe vacations. This is perhaps fair,\nand the Universities claim that not\nonly is it desirable, but in a few years\ntime, it will be necessary, in order to\ncope with the expansion of courses and\nfields of study. But how will all this affect the students and their\neducation? Surely such policies as\nthis are going to hasten the end of\nthe true university, putting in it spla oe great 'glass-house' cram-shops,\nchurning out by the thou sant, super-s pe oi aliz ed, pseudo-intellectual\nmorons, 'things' as remote from\npeople,as I.C. is from the moon -sorry the sun.\nSpeculative this mi^it all be, but\nthe above trends are real, and the\nactual emergence of the 52-week\nacademic year oo ul d be within the\nnext two or three years. What will it mean, and how will the future\nstudents of this college or any other\ncollege react to these sweeping changes?\nHow will the Postmaster General\ndelivery all the Xmas mail? Tour\nvoice influences these matters, - let it be heard!\nAROUND THE\nTOWN WANTED\n3 attractive Young Females in luxurious flat require the services\nof 1 handsome (non-con v eot ional) male\nabout the house.

Remuneration\nin accordance with satisfaction given.\nApply Box (36/22/36)3\nHow often has it been said, that\na theatre' critic's, first night and ill considered reviews have killed many\nan interesting play on the spot?\nHow often do I wish that it were true.\nYet this is very rarely the case.\nAudiences seem to derive some form of\nmasochistic pleasure from ignoring the\nwise words of those \"enlightened\"\ngentlemen and continue to go, almost\nas if to spite them.\nThis would seem to be the sad\nstory of \"Aunt Edwina\", new running\n(at least I think that it's still running) at the Fortune theatre.\nOn the first night the critics very\nrightly damned it,( I was there on\nthe fourth night, and I doubt whether\nit had got any worse in that time).\nThe management decided to withdraw\nthe aforesaid disgusting object at\nthe end of the week. On the sixth\nnight, the author of this farce,\nWilliam Douglas Home, presents himself to the audience and says, speaking\nof the critics, \"that means we\ndramatists, (how dare he call himself\nby that title) are writing for 10,\n14 or 16 men and that is bad, and\nit is wrong. The poor demented\ncrowd cheer ecstatically, and the show\ngoes on.\nLet my advice remain. Do not\ngo and see this petty farce. Do\nnot go and see the reincarnation of\nEdwardian drollery. Do not go and\nsee this charade.\nAlthough I have not yet had the\ninnocuous pleasure of visiting the\n\"Duke of York's\" to see Miss\nMargaret Lookwood in \"And Suddenly\nIts Spring\", I am informed on author-it y, good enough not to make me want\nto visit the \"Duke of York's\", that\nthis play might fall into the same\ngeneral category as \"Aunt Bdwina\".\nIn either case it is highly probable\nthat the audie no e would shout their\njoy so much that you would be unable\nto hear the humour in any case.\nThe Russians have at last launched themselves into the \"wide screen\".\nAt La Continentals is showing a magnificent Soviet film entitled \"The\nBeast\", which once again proves to\nus that the Russians are still capable of producing ex c it ment on a large scale. It is not the story,\nas you might expect of a monster from\nouter space, wielding tentacles and\nsix legs, but a rather moving account\nof the exp l its of Iiya Muronets, a legendary super-hero of the Russian\npeople, who by the use of his great\nsword was able to punish evildoers.\nIf your taste is one for the magnificent and grandiose, then perhaps\nyou will be interested in the new\nCinerama film entitled \"South Sea\nAdventure\" at the London Casino.\nPersonally, I feel that all Cinerama productions so far have\ntended to be the same, relying for\ntheir impact on large postcard views\nof South Sea Islands etc. This is not an exception. A film for the\nCinerama enthusiast rather than the\ndramatically minded film-goer.\nRicci\nPROFILE\nSHEILA BURBIDGE mm\nA person full of energy and\nvitality, Sheila has a full year ahead\nof her. She takes her Finals in\nBotany, and is Vice-President of the\nDramatic Society - she has taken part\nin all their productions except one\nin the past two years and appears\nagain this Christmas - and President\nof ICWSC. She enjoys watching foot-ball, and playing netball,tennis\ntable tennis, and squash, and brings\nto ICWSC the experience of Games\nCaptain at Finchley County Grammar\nSchool - 3he hopes to arrange a return visit of students from Delft\nUniversity, Holland, next Easter.\nA Cockney of20 years, she is immensely proud of London, and knows\nit well.

However, inspired by their new\no apt a in Paul Davies, and with some\nfurther hard training in 'bottle' this\ntrend o an be rapidly reversed.\nThe 6 th XI by reason of their\npre-eminent position play many other\nCollege 2nd and 3 rd XI's and having\nstarted off the season with a batch of\nLeague games are fighting hard to maintain their place in the U.L. League.\nThe 5 th XI are probably the most\nsuccessful side in the o lub to date having\nhad several good victories. A long trip to West Ham far an unsatisfactory 0-0\ndraw must have been very strenuous for in the next game St. Thomas's Hospital\nout them up by 10-1. With a good start\nin the League however, perhaps they well\nemulate the glorious deeds of last years\n\"Fighting Fifth*.\nLike the 5 th XI, the 4 th team have\nhad same unfortunate cancellations,\nwhich have given them little opportunity\nto show their mettle. They lost a very\nclose League game 1-0, to old rivals,\nInst, of Ed. last week (31st Oct.) but\nthe stirring eno our ag ment of o apt a in, Brian Wheeler, should prevent a re-occur en ce of this.\nThe 3 rd XI promise very well this\nyear having already had a great victory\nover Kings by 5-1 in the League.\nUrged on by the blood-curdling threats\nof George Bebster, \"captain extraordinary\",\nthey have won 3 of their last 4 games\nonly losing 3-2 to Southampton University\nIH. Another good start in 'the League\nhas been made by the 2nd XI who have\nbeaten both Sings and U.C. already.\nThe team is settling down well now and\nunder the able leadership of Chris.Ryan\nthey should Improve on last years 2nd team record.\nLast but not least we come to the\n1st XI. The season having started\nwith several close-fought games, apart\nfrom a crushing 6-0 preliminary round\nwin in the U.L. Cup, the team have had\nvaried luck against the opposition in the past fortnight. A20 lead against\nLulwioh Hamlet was wiped out in a fighting rally by the visitors in the\nsecond half. An injury to the I.C. goalkeeper then gave Dulwich the advantage to run out eventual winners\nby 4-2. Much the same story occurred\nin the following match against L.S.E. when I.C. again had much of the play\nbut unluckily the goalkeeper Hugh Payne,\nbroke his collar-bone just after half-'\ntime. Playing with 10 men I.C. were\nstill well in the game until in the\nclosing minutes a quick cross and a running header gave L.S.E. the victory.\nI.C.1s next gam s against Old Bradfieldians\nwas all too easy and the 8-0 win was\npoor preparation far the stem struggle\nagainst Kings on the following Wednesday.\nA33 draw might well have been converted\ninto a good win with a little extra effort\nall round.-Training sessions are still being\nheld every Tuesday and Thursday lunch-time, (meet in the Gym at 12.30), and\nin spite of Mr. Webster the Captain\nenjoys these tremendously and positively\nguarantees that everyone else will eventually.\nAfter a respectable start to the,\nseason, with a little more spirit and\nenthusiasm on the field and a little more sport off the field, this oo ul d well\nbe a vintage year for I.C. soccer.\nFELIX BOAT CLUB\nA crew wh i oh had never rowed\ntogether before, distinguished\nitself last Saturday by winning the\nSabin Cup, awarded annually to. crews\nnot of Junior status. The large\nhandsome tankard was won by first beating Thames Tradesmen, after a rather scrappy row, by 1 length.\nIn the final, the crew oom bin eda little better, end took 4 lengths\noff Ibis Rowing Club.\nThis is the first I.C. win in this event sino e1951, and augers\nwell for next year.\nB.H.P. CROSS COUNTRY\nThe teams have continued in fine\nform winning three matches and losing\none, two more being declared void due to\npeople going off o our se. On Wed. 28th the seo on d and third teams beat Marjpns,\ndue mainly to some fine running by\nE. Bennett (l), C.R. Huntley (2), P. Auton (3) and C. James ( 4 ) .\nOn Sat 31st, whilst nine members\nof the o lub were running for the\nUniversity against Cambridge, a weak-end second team easily beat teams from\nUniversity College and Goldsmiths. This\nrace saw this seasons debut of an allegedly\nunfit G.P. Tilly who lead the team to\nvictory followed by A.G. Hooker (2) and\nE. Bennett ( 3 ) .\nRacing over an unusually short course\non Wed. 4th, the second team defeated\nR.A.F. UxPridge and L.S.E. but were themselves well beaten by a very strong Borough\nRoad team.\nThe Bust canary \"Scrubbers'' match\nagainst R.U.C. was held on the same day\nwhen the captain lost yet another 5 pint\ndue to the teams unfortunate victory.\nThe main o ul pr its being R. Woolf ( 3 ) ,\nD. G. ream (4)/D. Rymer (5) P.S. Smith\n(6) and B. Butler ( 7 ) .\nSaturday 7th saw the o lub pioneer\nseveral new courses during the Midlands\nmato h at Leicester. When the three\nmain parts of the field reported to make\ntheir own different ways bao k to the\nfinish, the team was in the commanding\nposition of having all seven men in the\nfirst sixteen in a field of about fifty. In the meantime the seo on d team,\ndue to losing a member in the fog\nwere unable to chose a team in the\nmatch against Shoreditch T.C. HONOUR FOP ICWSC\nAs a result of the first mato h played by the University Womens\nHookey XI against Cambridge University, which London won 8 - 3\u00bb\nBiliary Tompsett has been selected\nfar the oom bin ed London-Camlridge\nteam. This team later played a combined Universities team from wh i oh is chosen the England Universities\nXI.\nThe soccer o lub is still managing\nto run 7 teams at the C03t of much\nanxiety and hard work on the part of the\no lub officials. This would be considerably eased if air- (repeat ALL)\nplayers would tick p ffa \u00a3 cross off on\nthe availability'list-and also tick off\nearly on team sheets. Remember this\nis your o lub and you are not at University to be spoon-fed, so play your\npart and look at the 'board when you\ncame into the Union.\nRUGBY\nLast Wednesday I.C. entered the\nseo on d round of the U.L. Rugby cup competition by beating Sir John Cass\n42pts to 11 \u2014 6 goals and 4 tries to\n1 goal and 2 penalties.\nTry scorers for I.C. were Strickland (1), Peart (3), Bruce (2), Banks\n(1), Milward (l), Lanoe ( l), and\nThompson ( l). Peart kicked four\nconversions and Bregazzi two.\nOutstanding for I.C. was Peart\nwho alone scored 17 pts and came very\nnear on several other occasions.\nThere was little to criticise in this\nI.C. team except perhaps some rather\nslack play during the second half\nwh i oh allowed Cass to score 11 points.\nThe game started with a bang and\nthe I.C. forwards immediately showed\ntheir superiority over a very ragged\nCass pack. After ten minutes I.C. started to move the ball to the backs\nwith immediate results. For the\nfirst time this season the sacks real lj looked dangerous and soon started\npiling up points. At half time I.C. led 26-0 and the 3o ore was a true\nreflection on their superiority;\nbacks and forwards and played well\nand for a relatively untried combination showed good cohesion.\nIn the second half this cohesion\nwas not so apparent and Cass were\nallowed to penetrate our defence on\none occasion and score; though I feel that their try came about hut\nbe o a use of lethargic tackling but\nrather through an over eagerness on our\npart to score mere points. If one\ncould pick out individuals who were\noutstanding in a team wh i oh played so\nwell then they would be Randal Peart,\nDave Howell, and Pat Bruce. Randal\nalways looked dangerous when in possession and one feels that his tal ents are rather wasted at full back.\nDave Howell our new hooker was a real\nlive wire in the loose. Pat Bruce\nscored two tries but was worth many\nmore. He was always up at the front\nof the play ready to pounce on any\nmistake.\nWell we won 42-11 but a ward\nabout Cass. Although they were in\ntheir own words 'outclassed' they\nnever once gave up trying and after\nthe game they were all there at\nclosing time in the I.C. bar. A good bunch of fellows and a pleasure\nto play.\nIn the next round of the cup we\nmeet Kings and if we are to regain\nour cup that they borrowed last year\nand I'm sure we will, then we need\nplenty of support. . So come along and\nsupport us in this match. Details\nof coaches etc. will bo put up on\nthe union and rugby club not io boards.\nM.B. SWIMMING\nDuring the last two weeks, the\nfixtures of the o lub have imp rn werl.. The* first team defeated Kings 5-0.\nChatham R.E.43, and a Joint \"Sap-per s\" team from Chatam and Aldershot\n6-1. A oom bin ed2 nd and 3rd team\nplayed Marphy Richards and won 6-3\nand the 2nd team drew 3-3 with\nChelsea. The first team standard\nhas definitely improved, but the 2nd team is still lethargic. Lack of\nfixtures seems to be the trouble here,\nand more ball pra ot ioe would result\nin all the o lub teams improving.\nAll the o lub teams are now looking\nforward to the U.L. U. knock-out\nfa and ioa p competition, the prize for\nw hio his a pint of beer.\nHere's hoping.\nJ.C.

Even though the display\nlasted only fifteen minutes, it seemed\nto be much enjoyed.\nThe bonfire this year was made up\nmostly of wood from the old Guilds\nbuilding and proved to be one of the\nlargest ever. So much so that it set\nthe hedge behind on fire and had the\npolice extremely worried as flames\ntwenty or thirty feet high swept\nover the road.\nThe inside of the pavi JS. on made\na sharp contrast with the efl ld, damp\nand somewhat foggy atmosphere of tae\nplaying fields. Couples danced,\njived, drank and ate innumerable hot\ndogs in the gaily decorated and very\nwarm upstairs portion of the pavilion.\nNearly everybody seemed to be better\nbehaved this year and only two fire works were thrown onto the dance floor\nto drown temporarily the lively music\nof Derek Pyke and his band.\nThe evening's entertainment ended\nat about 10.45 p.m.t with a rousing\nAuld Lang Syne and it was very comforting for the Entertainments Committee to see so many people really\nre luo tant to leave.\nI.f t fH..

Hicholson (capt.)\nJUDO\nOn Wednesday the Judo team revenged themselves for their previous\ndefeat,by a decisive win over Goldsmiths. There were six contests, and\ninstead of the usual one point o on teats, the best of three points were fought.\nThis did not affect the result which was\n5 wins and a draw to I.C. These contests\nwere stopped inside the time, and a varied\ncollection of techniques tried.\nMOTORING NEWS The big news of the week is that\nof Bo's arrival in Brighton with 55\nminutes to spare. Pushed up all steep\nhills by several keen Guildsmen with\nonly the driver aboard, Bo won her\nmedal and pennant for puno tu al arrival.\nThis rather labour ed performance\nwhich is unusual for Bo who usually\nromps up all the hills with a full complement aboard was due to her running on only one of her two cylinders.\nOn the previous Friday, the exhaust\nvalve seating developed some cracks\nand water poured into the cylinder.\nThis had been temporarily repaired but\nthe repair had proved to be inadequate.\nBo was rigged lip with a temporary\nooo ling system, but she lost water at\na fantastic rate, probably faster than\nthe 3team cert'. In fact, during the\ntrip, about }0 gallons of water were\npoured in.\nAa usual Jezebel followed tj\u00bb\u00bb\n\u2022veterans\" down to Brighton, taking\nlonger over the journey them ever\nbefore. The dry day brought out many\nmotorist^ but road works along the\nA23 'caused large jams. Unlike last\nyear, Jez had to keep on the left for\nmost of the way, giving v any to veterans travelling on the \"wrong'' side\nof the road. Brighton was reached\njust before 1 p.m. The absence of\nBo detracted from the excellent lunch\nto which the crew was invited by the\nGuilds Motor Club.\nt Sunday, All Saints Day, dawned\nclear and soon became brig^fi* most\nwent to Church at Wytham, which was\npacked. Lunch followed, and the\nafternoon was spent with an Oxford\nguide ( little g) touring some of the\nColleges. These were impressive\nfor their quietness in such a busy\nCity^and their partially restored\nbeauty. We were generously entertained to teat iti a College room, and\ndeparted our Viriou3 ways after a mem^i ble weekend.\nM. J.R. N.B. Will the Guildsman who borrowed\nJez's tow rope, please return it if he has not already done so.\nTonights meeting of the Guilds Motor\nClub is in the form of a quiz, with\nprizes for the top scorer.\n( I could mention the results of\nthe 4\n4\n0 yards but prefer not to do so U.) HOCKEY ul. CUP.\nIn the l st round of the U.L. cup,\nI.C. made a slow start against Wye College\nGood approach work was spoilt by bad\nfinishing throughout the first half.\nConsequently at half time I.C. had scored\nbut one goal.\nCn the resumption of play Wye went\nnear to equalizing but the I.C. defence\nremained cool and collected. Suddenly\nI.C. sprang to the attack and scored\nfour quick goals wh i oh left Wye reeling.\nAt this stage I.C. were playing their\nbest hockey of this season and with better\nluo k the score might have been further\nimproved on. Thus the final result was\nI.C.5 Wye 0.\nGoalsoorer3 De Broekert 3\nWalker 1\nKing 1\nAlthough a small college, Wye must\nnot be underestimated since last season\nthey reached the semi-finals of this com-petition. This win reflects much credit\non the I.C. attack. The defense showed\nsome weaknesses which will have to be\nremedied,nevertheless Syd Lenssen,\nobtained his first 'Shot-out' of the\nseason.\nAs yet the l st XI is having mixed\nfortunes having won 4 and lost 4. The\n2\nnd XI has made a fine start with an\nunbeaten record. The strength of the\no lub is underlined by the support fOr\nthe 3rd and 4th XI's which are accounting\nwell for themselves.\nThe mixed hockey have won,lost and\ndrawn the three matches r_ laye*? As in\nprevious years more support is required\nfrom the ladies especially the fresher s. Those interested 3hould contact Tony\nMiller Room 43, Garden Hall.\nGOLF\nThe captain and one other member\nof the team played regularly for the\nUniversity 2\nnd team - the Blasters.\nThey have both won more than half their\nmatches.\nAt present arrangements are being\nmade for a tour in Scotland with matches against several of the Universities\nnorth of the border.\nThe season promises to be a good\none as considerable support ha3 resulted from our first meeting, when about\n4\n0 people attended.\nThe introduction of group lessons\nis a success and some dozen people\ngo up to Highgate every Wednesday.\nOur matches this term have ended\nin uncertainty - both times the\nopposition has failed to turn up j no\ndoubt they had been pre-wa med of the\nall round strength of our team.\nATHLETICS\nThe result of the Athletics Club\nTrial on Wednesday 4th November proved\nthat the strength of the Club may be\neven greater than last year. However,\nat this trial not all of last year's outstanding athletes were able to attend.\nThe be^t performance *as put up by\nthe University first string 220 yd s run\nrunner A.W. McDonald, when he clocked\n12.1 seconds for 120 yard3, and 22.8 for\n220 yard3 against a wind. A runner who\nnever seems tp fade from the fore in\nCollege Athletics is John Collins who\nproduced an extremely good effort when\nwinning the mile in 4 mins. 35 sec on us.I am told that the results of the\ntrial compare very favourably, with\nthose of Cambridge University only two\nweeks earlier.\n\n"
