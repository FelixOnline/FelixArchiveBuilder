Yes, you guessed\nit, it was the Brighton 10k.\nWith only a few hours\nsleep, the runners got\nup at 5AM to take the\ntrain to the south coast\nof England. Some of the\nteam were surprised to\nfind out the employees of\nSouthern Rail were not on\nstrike at that time of the\nday.\nAt 9:30am sharp the\nrace began with the 51\nImperial students competing against 2000 runners.\nThe weather was perfect,\nwith no clouds in the sky\nand the mercury staying\nfirmly above 50 C.\nNiki Faulkner lead the\nteam with an amazing\npace; keeping up with\nsome of the best runners\nin the field. He managed\nto finish the race in 31\nminutes and 52 seconds!\nWow!\nThe Club Captain,\nFergus Johnson, managed\nto score another great\nresult, finishing the race\nin 35:02, and registering\na new personal best in the\nprocess.\nAnother PB was earned\nby Euan Bell, who came\nthird in the Imperial men\u2019s\nrankings, finishing the\nrace in 37:14.\nICXCAC\u2019s ladies also\nran great times; scoring\nsome amazing results and\nreminding us why they\nare in the first place of\nthe cross country league.\nThe club was glad to be\nvisited by one of the club\nlegends, Anna Lawson,\nwho lead the ladies with\nan amazing time of 38:34.\nThe Imperial alumna\ncommented, \u201cI finally\ngot a sub-40 10k!\u201d That\nprobably excludes splits\nin the many cross country\nraces and marathons she\nhas done.\nAlex Mundell, a former\nClub Captain put in a lot\nof effort, finishing the\nrace with a superb time of\n39:30.\nBack on the men\u2019s\nside it was surprising\nseeing James Millet, one\nof the finest young track\nathletes, taking part. He\nlikely treated it like any\nother 800m race, done\n12.5 times back-to-back.\nGreat effort, James! It\nonly took him 35:47\nseconds to finish the race.\nAt the scene, Millet\nquestioned, \u201cWhy is this\nrace so long?!\u201d\nThe club eagerly awaits\nhis debut in the cross\ncountry league, as he\ncould help the men\u2019s team\ntake a higher position\nin the ranking. Maybe I\nshould have talked about\nhim in the first paragraph\nof the article, but hopefully he will not mind.\nIt was a great day to see\nsome new faces in the club\nrunning at fast pace - faster\nthan the wind. Some of\nthose were Lucas Kreifels\nand Cedric Ormond who\nran the race in 38:14 and\n39:38 respectively. Alix\nVermeulen ran her first\n10k in an amazing 39:49,\nproving herself a strong\ncontender for the Fresher\nof the Year award. Keep\nthe momentum going!\nWell, my friends,\nafter reading those paragraphs about how well\neverybody did, you are\nprobably wondering how\nI found the race. The race\nwas great, the sun was\nsmiling and I think I know\nthe answer to \u201cWho was\nfirst, the chicken or the\negg,\u201d as at some point\nI found myself racing\na giant inflatable duck.\nThat is when I realised I\nneeded to step up the pace\nand finish the race with a\ndecent time. I also think\nit was sunny enough to\nstart building my base tan.\nIt was great having other\nmembers of the club who\ncould not run that day\ncheering and supporting\ntheir fellow students.\nThe wonderful\nWomen\u2019s Captain, Charlotte Barratt, celebrated\nher birthday with the club\nthat day and made sure\neveryone was able to get\nsome top quality face\npaint with personalised\ndesigns.\nWhile I was running\nI could hear Secretary\nDuncan Hunter shouting,\n\u201cYou\u2019re a tank! You\u2019re the\npredator, he\u2019s the prey!\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure what he\nwas referring to - maybe\nRemy Shaieb, who ran an\namazing sub-40 race.\nIn the afternoon, our\nathletes headed to the\nbeach to chill and chat.\nWe had some interesting\ndiscussions about rocks\nand how they are so\nsimple, yet they can represent the complex society\nwe are part of. All rocks\nare different; they come in\ndifferent shapes and sizes,\nbut they are still happy\nto lie next to each other.\nWhen you look into the\ndistance you cannot tell\nthem apart - all you can\nsee is the beautiful beach\nthat never ends.\nUntil next time, keen\nbeans!\nCrossCountryandAthleticsmaketheirannualpilgrimagetoBrightonforafast,flat10kmracealongtheseafront\nThe runners prepare for the challenge ahead by yawning, face-painting, and undressing // Noemie David-Rogeat\nThe giant, inflatable duck that was chasing me down //\nNoemie David-Rogeat\n\n"

If\nyour answer is like mine \u2013\nnigh on every night \u2013 then\nten-piece brass band, the\nOld Dirty Brasstards,\nhave got your back. With\nfour trumpets, three trom-bones, two percussionists,\nand a tuba, the Old Dirty\nBrasstards frequent The\nBlues Kitchen with their\nblues, swing, and jazz\ncovers for Friday night\nparty-goers looking for\na night-club alternative.\nThis was their first foray\ninto a ticketed headline\ngig, and what a triumph it\nwas.\nThe anticipation for\nthe gig was built around\na month in advance, when\nout of the blue (heh)\nFacebook targeted advertisements suggested the\nevent. It was with good\nfortune that I chanced\nacross the tickets before\nthe release as they sold out\nwithin the hour, prompting the addition of three\nfurther London dates and\neven a trip up to Sheffield.\nThe disco ball-lit room\ndimmed and the band\nmembers sauntered on\n\u201cThe melody\nwas shared\nbetween the\nlead trumpet\nand trombone,\nwith bass lines\nby the tuba\u201d\nstage, instruments in\nhand, and immediately\nlaunched into \u2018The View\nfrom the Afternoon\u2019. The\nmain melody was shared\nbetween the lead trumpet\nand trombone throughout\nthe evening, with bass\nlines being picked up by\nthe tuba and remaining\ntrombones. Each track had\nan added twist imposed\nby the band, most notably\na samba feel on \u2018Dancing\nShoes\u2019. The atmosphere\nbuilt through the set, as\nthe audience danced,\ndrank, and sang their way\nthrough the massive 2006\nalbum.\nThe Old Dirty Brasstards gave an almost\ntheatrical performance,\nwith tight melodies and\nrhythms, and plenty of encouragement for audience\nparticipation. There was\neven a hand-painted sign\nthat was held up for the\n\u201cda-da, da-da-da\u201d section\nafter the second chorus of\n\u2018Still Take You Home\u2019.\nMuch like all Arctic\nMonkey gigs I have been\nto, the crowd came alive\nfor the instrumental bars\nafter \u201cHe\u2019s a scumbag,\ndon\u2019t you know!\u201d in\n\u2018When the Sun Goes\nDown\u2019 and sang their\nhearts out to \u2018Mardy\nBum\u2019. That being said, I\nhave never before been\nto a gig where there are\nchants of \u201ctuba! tuba!\ntuba!\u201d\u2026\nMy only slight criticism\nis that with no frontman to\nlead the crowd through\nAlex Turner\u2019s carefully\ncrafted lyrics, the audience\u2019s singing left a\nlot to be desired, which\nsometimes seemed to put\noff the band, particularly\nduring \u2018You Probably\nCouldn\u2019t See for the\nLights But You Were\nStaring Straight at Me\u2019.\nPersonally, I believe the\noccasional messy verse\nand tempo differences\nadded to the whole expe-rience; the iconic nature\nof the album and the brass\nband lends itself to a mass\ncrowd singalong, even if,\nto some amusement, the\nverses are muddled or\npeople come in too early.\nThe highlight of the\nnight must be the unexpected encore, where we\nwere treated to three more\nArctic Monkeys songs; \u2018R\nU Mine?\u2019, \u2018Fluorescent\nAdolescent\u2019 and \u2018Brianstorm\u2019. There is no doubt\nthat every member is an\nincredible musician with a\nlove for Arctic Monkeys;\none trombone player even\nwore Tranquillity Base\nmerch! I don\u2019t think this is\nthe last we will hear of the\nOld Dirty Brasstards \u2013 I\ncannot recommend them\nhighly enough. If they add\nmore dates or expand their\nrepertoire to Favourite\nWorst Nightmare, I\u2019ll\ncertainly be the first one\nthere.\nMUSIC\nBobbi Lang\nMusic Writer\nVenue: The Blues Kitchen,\nBrixton.

Over 90 students\nrecruited through these\nMarrow events have gone\non to donate stem cells.\nAs part of a year-long\ncelebration to raise awareness of the need for more\nstem cell donors, Marrow\ngroups will be holding a\nseries of fundraising and\ndonor recruitment events.\nCharlotte Cunliffe,\nMarrow Programme\nLead, said, \"This year,\nour wonderful Marrow\ncommunity is proud to\nbe celebrating 20 years\nof saving lives. Our work\nin universities is vital,\nbecause it allows us to\nreach a young and diverse\ngroup of people. We are\nexcited about the next\n20 years and are looking\nforward to spreading the\nword about the lifesaving\npotential of students on\ncampuses across London.\"\nPatients from black,\nAsian or other minority\nethnic backgrounds have\njust a 20% chance of\nfinding a matching stem\ncell donor, compared to\n69% of patients from north\nEuropean backgrounds.\nAs such, Marrow students\naim to recruit potential\ndonors from a range of\nbackgrounds.\nWith more than 1500\npeople recruited by\nstudent volunteers having\ngone on to donate their\nstem cells, Marrow has\ngone from strength to\nstrength and continues\nto work hard to save the\nlives of people with blood\ncancer.\nTo find out more about\nMarrow Groups, visit\nwww.anthonynolan.org/\nmarrow.

Based\non the feedback, one\nkey cause of this issue is\nthat some library users\nleave their belongings to\n\u2018reserve\u2019 a space \u2013 sometimes for hours at a time.\nThis causes dissatisfaction\namong those trying to find\na study space, and is not\nan effective or fair use of\nthe limited space available\nin the library.\nA Study Break Card\nscheme was chosen as\na solution by looking to\nsimilar schemes successfully implemented at other\nuniversity libraries.\nIntroducing study break\ncards during the busiest\nperiods \u2013 close to exam\nand assessment dates \u2013\nwill lead to more library\nusers being able to find a\nspace when they need to\nstudy, leading to a more\neffective use of the space\navailable.\nThe scheme also\nencourages users to take\nregular breaks from\nstudying which is positive\nfor wellbeing and will\nhopefully lead to healthier studying habits. The\nscheme allows users to\ntake breaks of up to 30\nminutes without forfeiting\nthe study space they are\nusing by simply filling out\na card and leaving it on\nthe desk they are using.\nUsers wishing to leave\nfor over 30 minutes, for\nexample to attend classes,\nwill be expected to clear\nthe space they have been\nusing and take their belongings with them.\n30 minutes. The success\nof the scheme hinges on\nwhether or not library\nusers respect the cards and\neach other\u2019s belongings,\nand library staff will be\nmonitoring for any abuse\nof the scheme during the\npilot.\nFeedback on the\nscheme is essential to\nmake sure that it meets\nthe needs of Library users\n\u2013 so please provide feedback to the library using\nASK the Library https://\nimperial.service-now.\ncom/ask or by emailing\nlibrary@imperial.ac.uk.\nThere are also paper feedback forms available and\nfriendly staff to chat to at\nthe Information Hub on\nlevel 1 of the Library.\nCards will be available\nfrom card dispensers on\nall levels of the Central\nLibrary and at the Information Hub.

The not-so-firm print deadline that\nI've enjoyed and exploited\nall term is starting to\ntighten up.\nHaving said that, it's\n11.21pm and I'm only\nnow writing this. So we\nmight not have a paper this\nweek, depending on if the\nprinters refuse to put up\nwith my shit any longer.\nWho knows, they may\neven be like the College\nand cap it at 40%?\nI've also just realised\nI haven't had the time\nto change my editorial\npicture. One day, my\nfriends, one day. Or is it\ntoo late to even bother?\nI'm starting to thing this\nis becoming kinda like my\nbrand.\nThis week's Felix goes\nlite, with only 32 pages.\nI see this as the calm\nbefore the storm because\nnext week's issue, which\nis the final issue of term,\nis certain to be a thicc\nboi. Coming soon to a\ncommon room near you.\nFunny how so many\npeople told me, \"it gets\neasier after Imperial\".\nbecause this literal 11th\nhour adrenaline rush feels\nvery familiar. At least this\ntime I don't get kicked out\nof the building. And I get\nto control the temperature\nin the office (perks of the\njob).\nWe've got some great\npieces in the paper this\nweek. With almost a full\nterm gone, we've heard\nfrom staff and students\nbased in White City on\nhow they've found it so\n2\nfar. Some interesting\nopinions and perspectives\nwere shared.\nThere's also a comment\npiece from Lasith reflecting on his experience of\nthe Boxing Day Tsunami\nalmost 14 years ago,\nin Galle, Sri Lanka. A\ndefinite must-read.\nAsalways,Icouldn'tget\nany of this done without\nthe great work of the Felix\nteam. Speaking of who,\nwe took over ACC this\nweek (hyberbole? Yes,\nbut who cares). The next\nfew weeks are shaping up\nto be very social-heavy in\nthe Felix office is getting\ninto the festive spirit .

    "content": "Felix Reviews: Deltarune Chapter 1\nGames\nConnor Winzar\nGames Editor\nI\nt has been three\nlong years since\nthe release of the\nRPG wonder that\nwas Undertale. With its\ninteresting gameplay me-chanics, outstanding OST\nand plethora of brilliant\ncharacters, it\u2019s hard to\nbelieve that its creator,\nToby Fox, could possibly\ntop it. I can just about\nsay that Deltarune has\nthe potential to surpass\nits predecessor, with an\ninventive combat system,\nnew well fleshed out\ncharacters and spectacular\nOST that is arguably\nbetter than the first game.\nThe reason that I say\n\u2018potential\u2019 is because only\nonly one chapter of the\ngame has been released\nthus far; without a complete story it cannot truly\nbe compared to the source\nmaterial. Nonetheless the\ngame retains some of the\nqualities and characters\nof the previous game (for\nexample Temmie, who\nreturns with a good supply\nof poorly constructed\nsentences) whilst putting\na twist on the game with\nit being set in a different\nuniverse from Undertale.\nStory:\nRight from the opening\ncharacter customisation,\nDeltarune retains all the\ncharm and personality\nmany of us grew to love\nin Undertale--a mixture\nof comedy, philosophy\nand nihilism that we can\nall appreciate. As well as\nplenty more satirisation\nof the RPG genre, with\ncertain points in the game\nbluntly reminding you of\nthe linear nature of the\ngenre as a whole and the\nexpectations that lies with\nit. This sort of whismy is\ncarried out throughout the\nentire game with moments\nof bluntness to silliness\nto borderline tears for\nhow sweet the characters\ncan be. Compared to the\nstale dialogue and arc\nthat RPG\u2019s usually have,\nDeltarune managed to\nkeep me invested in its\ncharacters. Following\nyour atypical Earthbound\nstyle RPG, the game starts\noff in a suburban town,\ncomplete with iconic\nundertale characters. Just\nlike its predecessor, you\nfind yourself in a similar\nbody to the previous\nprotagonist, with just as\nmuch of a talkative personality as you navigate\nthe town whilst seeing\ncharacters of the previous\ngame in different sideline\nroles. However, this\ndoesn\u2019t last for long as the\ngame abruptly transitions\ninto a different world.\nAlong with your ultra-vi-olent classroom bully\nSusie, you encounter the\nlovable pushover Ralsei,\nwho informs you of the\nprophecy about their\ncombined forces being\nneeded to save the world.\nTrying my best not to spoil\nthe treasure trove that is\nthe story, the game continues with the characters\ndefeating enemies with\neither kindness or a blood\nfuelled rampage, with\nplenty of laughs, fun and\nsoul eating heartbreak.\nThe game is ruthless when\nit comes to hitting you\nright in the feels.\nGameplay:\nTaking the gameplay\nstyle of Undertale,\nDeltarune improves\nupon it by including a\nparty system in which\ncharacters can each carry\nout one of the following\nactions: attack, act, item,\nspare, defend. Striking\nthe same vein as final\nfantasy, characters are\nsituated on the left hand\nside with enemies on the\nright in a turn based fight.\nAttacks can be avoided\nwith the previous game\u2019s\nmechanic of the player\nmoving the heart to dodge\nthem. The player also has\nthe ability to carry out the\nclassic act of sparing, but\nthey also now have the\nability to use pacifist or\nnon-pacifists actions, in\nwhich the theme of good\nand bad is made abundantly clear. The actions\nthemselves are unique to\neach character with some\ngoing the pacifist route\nand others not so much.\nSimilar to a standard RPG,\none of the characters is\na mage who is capable\nof using spells, provided\nthe player has generated\nenough of the TP metre\n(essentially mana points)\nfrom avoiding attacks or\ndefending. With plenty\nof laughs and gags inbuilt\ninto the combat, it\u2019s a nice\nchange of pace from the\nusual RPG monotony and\nseriousness.\nThe Verdict:\nUnder the humongous\npressure of living up to\nUndertale\u2019s reputation,\nDeltarune does a fantastic\njob of building on the\nmaterial from the last\ngame whilst providing\nnew and original content.\nI struggle to find any fault\nwith the game given that it\nlives up to every standard\nset by the previous game,\nwith fantastic characters,\nOST, gameplay, and\noverall fantastic story arc\nthat leaves you enamored\nby its universe. And that\u2019s\nnot even mentioning\nthe spectacle that is the\nslapstick humour of the\ngame that makes you appreciate that much more.\nMy only possible critique\nof the game is that I want\nthe next chapter to come\nout ASAP, I want to\nexperience more Lancer\nwholesomeness as well as\nthe return of \u2018that face\u2019 he\nmakes!\nAnother fantastic addition to the series. Toby Fox yet again hits gold with a game set in a different version of the\nUndertale universe that brings everything you loved from the first game and so much more!\nOne of the first of many fantastic pieces of Deltarune fan art // Reddit User: u/ItzDFPlayer\nISSUE 1707\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1707\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14\nThe Overstory: a giant redwood of a novel\nBOOKS\nTom Stroud\nBooks Writer\nT\nhis is not our\nworld with trees\nin it. It\u2019s a world\nof trees, where\nhumans have just arrived.\u201d\nEcological catastrophe,\nperhaps the biggest issue\nof our generation, has\nnever been more vividly\nportrayed than in Richard\nPowers\u2019s twelfth novel\nThe Overstory. After\nmaking his name with the\naward-winning The Echo\nMaker in 2006, Powers\nhas graced the literary\nworld with a series of\nspellbinding tales. In this\nlatest ambitious novel\nhe challenges the selfish\nexceptionalism of humans\nthrough the eyes of nine\ntree-activists. The central\nmessage is clear: we are\ndisconnected from a vast\nnatural world surrounding\nus.\nThe story is structured\ninto four sections resembling the morphology\nof trees: Roots, Trunk,\nCrown, and Seeds.\nIn \u2018Roots\u2019, he introduces us to the nine protago-nists, a range of characters\nfrom a wide variety of\nbackgrounds: an airforce\nloadmaster who is saved\nfrom falling by a banyan\ntree in the Vietnam War; a\ncouple who, in an attempt\nto save their marriage,\nplant a tree in their garden\nevery year only to be supernaturally rewarded; a\n1980s college student who\nelectrocutes herself and\nis mysteriously brought\nback to life; a disabled\nbotanist who discovers\ntrees communicating with\neach other and eventually\npublishes a seminal book\nwhich becomes the bible\nof a new movement.\nThe botanist is Dr.\nPatricia Westerford, a\nwoman whose years spent\nresearching forests are\nprematurely mocked following her findings about\ntrees communicating (a\nreal discovery \u2013 see The\nHidden Life of Trees by\nPeter Wohlleben), but\nwho is later congratulated\nand vindicated.\nAs one becomes\nfamiliar with the ideas\nbehind her findings, it is\nclear that the chemical\ninteractions between the\ntrees are symbolic of\nthe later relationships\nbetween the characters.\nPowers\u2019s language is\nmeditative yet scientific\n\u2013 \u201cIn summer, water rises\nthrough the xylem and disperses out of the million\ntiny mouths on the undersides of leaves, a hundred\ngallons a day evaporating\nfrom the tree\u2019s airy crown\ninto the humid Iowa air.\u201d\nHe cleverly integrates\nhis obvious scientific\nknowledge with literary\ntalent, resulting in a book\nwhich is both poetic and\neducational.\nFollowing the discrete\nand unrelated backsto-ries in \u2018Roots\u2019, the later\nsections see the characters\u2019 lives become inter-twined. This slower-paced\npart of the book allows us\nto see how the characters\u2019\nunique and meaningful\nconnection with trees\ndrives their pursuit of\nthe same interests, and\nultimately leads to them\ntaking up the same cause.\nBy focusing less on the\ncharacters and more on the\ncentral theme, the author\nurges us to reconsider our\nrelationship with Mother\nNature.\nWhile it may be argued\nthat such powerful themes\nreduce characters into\nmere rhetorical devices,\nPowers raises pressing\nissues which cannot be\nignored. Just this month\nit was announced by the\nMet Office, in its first\nmajor update on climate\nchange in 10 years, that\nUK summer temperatures\ncould be 5.2\u00b0C hotter by\n2070. Moreover, the US\nNational Climate Change\nAssessment has found that\nclimate change is to increasingly \u201cdisrupt many\nareas of life\u201d in the future\nthrough consequences\nsuch as crop failures,\nwildfires, flooding, and\naltered coast lines.\nDespite these warnings,\nthe politicians of the\nworld are slow to act, as\ndemonstrated by President\nDonald Trump ordering\nfurther deforestation of\nNorth America\u2019s tree\npopulation. The message\nis apparently not clear\nenough.\nThe climax of the\nnovel centres around a\nprotest against the logging\nof an old forest.

    "content": "SriLankanPoliticsisinasorrystateof Affairs\nWiththeshockattempttoappointRajapaksaasPrimeMinister,SriLankanpoliticsisinturmoil\nyet again.\nPOLITICS\nDivyen Vanniasegaram\nPolitics Editor\nO\nver the last\nmonth there has\nbeen significant\npolitical turmoil\nin Sri Lanka which kicked\noff on the 26th October\nwhen the President of Sri\nLanka, Sirisena, attempted\nto sack Wickremesinghe,\nthe Prime Minister.\nSirisena has tried to replace him with Rajapaksa,\nwho was the sitting\nPresident Sirisena ousted\nin the 2015 Presidential\nelections, highlighting\nthe strange nature of Sri\nLankan politics. Sirisena\u2019s\ncampaign was built on\nattacking Rajapaksa\u2019s\nregime for being corrupt\nand built to serve his own\nfamily before the rest of\nthe countrry.\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s\nand President\u2019s respective\nparties formed a working\ncoalition following Parliamentary elections in 2015\nwhich left no party with a\nmajority. In recent months\nthe relationship between\nthe two men has become\nincreasingly acrimonious\nover issues ranging from\neconomic policy through\nto accusations of assassination plots against the\nPresident. Despite these\ngrievances the sudden\nattempted sacking of the\nPrime Minister was a\nshock decision. This has in\nturn led to a constitutional\ncrisis in the country with\nWickremesinghe refusing\nto go, claiming Sirisena\nacted beyond the remit of\nhis constitutional powers.\nThere have been mass\nprotests on the streets\nboth for and against the\nremoval of Wickremesinghe which turned deadly\nwhen a protester was\nshot dead by a member\nof Wickremesinghe\u2019s\nsecurity. There\u2019s little\ndoubt that this has been\na co-ordinated power\ngrab by Sirisena and Rajapaksa, and the Supreme\nCourt has suspended the\ndecision pending full\ncourt procedures beginning on the 4th December.\nParliament\u2019s role in this\nsaga has been vital. It was\nthought that Sirisena made\nthis snap decision because\nthere was a majority in\nParliament to support Rajapaksa. When this looked\nin doubt Sirisena proceeded to suspend Parliament\nto buy himself more time\nto ensure that more MPs\ncould be convinced to\nback Rajapaksa. Parliament has since recon-vened, but Rajapaksa has\nnow lost 2 votes of con-fidence, demonstrating\nthere is still no majority\nfor him. In all of this\nParliament has become a\nmockery. Rival MPs have\nphysically attacked each\nother, throwing books\nand other items across the\nChamber and threatened\nto attack the Speaker;\nvirtually blocking any\nParliamentary business\nfrom taking place. Both\nsets of MPs have also\nboycotted Parliament in\nprotest at the situation.\nSirisena and Rajapaksa\nhave now attempted to\ncall for fresh elections\nas a way of shifting the\nParliamentary arithmetic\nin their favour.\nFor many the replacement of Rajapaksa as\nPresident in 2015 was\nseen as a step forward for\nSri Lanka leaving behind\nan era filled with sectarian violence and war.\nRajapaksa defeated the\nTamil Tigers (a militant\norganization) in 2009 but\nin the process oversaw\nnumerous war crimes and\nhuman rights violations\nwith anywhere between\n9,000 and 40,000 civilians\ndying in the final days of\nthe conflict. The Tamil\nTigers also committed\nwar crimes including targeting civilians and child\nconscription. The war\ncrimes committed by both\nsides could and should\nnever be condoned. The\ngovernment at the time\nand to do this day has\nresisted any attempts\nfor an internationally\nled investigation to take\nplace to look into what\nhappened. Rajapaksa was\nseen as a hero to some for\nending the war but seen\nas a murderer to others.\nIt was difficult to see how\nhe could bring about true\nreconciliation between the\ngroups involved, and in\ntruth there were few signs\nthis was ever something\nhe was really interested in\nas he stood on an overtly\nnationalistic platform.\nSirisena was supported\nthe Tamil diaspora, many\nof whom had not returned\nto their home towns\nand villages for decades\nsince they had left the\ncountry during the civil\nwar. This was taken as an\nopportunity to visit their\nmotherland and for some\nre-establish roots in the\ncountry. Sirisena\u2019s government has clearly seen\nin progress but has also\nbeen disappointing. On\ndomestic policy Sirisena\nhad pledged a reform\nprogram for the first 100\ndays of his Presidency.\nHowever; significant parts\nof his reform program\nsuch as electoral reform\nwere never carried out\nand he now claims not\nto recognise the plans as\nis his own at all. Further\ninvestment is still needed\nin areas of the country that\nwere worst affected by the\ncivil war to help them\ndevelop and prosper.\nIt\u2019s disappointing and\nworrying to see Sirisena\nattempt to thwart the\nconstitution and the rule\nof law to appoint a man\nwho he has accused of\nnepotism and corruption\nas Prime Minister. The\ncrisis that has ensued has\nleft Parliament in paralysis and the country in\nturmoil with little hope of\na speedy resolution.\nRajapaksa // Wikimedia\n\u201cThe atrocities\ncommitted\nby both sides\ncould and\nshould never\nbe condoned.\u201d\nby nearly all the other\nopposition parties as a\ncommon candidate in\n2015 showing how broad\nthe movement to replace\nRajapaksa was.\nSirisena\u2019s surprise win\nbrought with it optimism\nand hope that more\nsteps would be taken\nfor reconciliation and\ntolerance between the\ndifferent ethnic groups in\nSri Lanka.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFRIDAY, 30TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n8\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe End of the Union as We Know It\nPissed off paddy, Lochlann Allison, explains why the DUP are the greatest threat to any chance\nof a successful Brexit.\nCOMMENT\nLochlann Allison\nComment Writer\nA\nfter a long day\nof uni, I return\nhome to retire\nfor the evening.\nI slump on my sofa and\nflick on the tv to a comedy\nchannel for my daily\nintake of shits and giggles.\nThe comedy channel I\nrefer to is, obviously, BBC\nNews. For the last two\nweeks, I have watched the\ncomedy sketch, that is Her\nMajesty\u2019s Government,\nwith crippling anxiety and\ndebilitating uncertainty.\nAt this point, I think\nI will be one of the first\nto say it: Theresa May\nhas come away with a\nworkable deal.\nThe deal I refer to is\nthe \u201cIrish-Backstop Deal\u201d\nwhich states that in the\nevent of a no-deal being\nreached by 2020, no\nhard border would arise\nbetween the Republic\nof Ireland and Northern\nIreland. Intended to\nprevent a resurgence of\nthe sectarian violence of\nthe Troubles and significant economic damage\nto border businesses, the\nbackstop deal would keep\nNorthern Ireland as part of\nthe UK, but in an annexed\nEU customs union. The\nBackstop deal was agreed\nas an acceptable contingency by the UK, the\nEU and the Republic of\nIreland on Sunday.\nIn my opinion, the Irish\nBackstop is favourable\nto everyone and finally\nputs the uncertainty of\nthe border in Ireland after\nBrexit to bed.\nThose in Generation X\nshould be happy with the\ndeal. If like me you\u2019re\nconfused by generational\nlabelling, this is our\nparents! Now be honest\nwith yourself and admit it:\nyour parents are massive\nBrexiteers. The impending sense of doom you\nfeel at the dinner table\nwhen you invite your\nEuropean friends over to\nstay during the summer\nsound familiar? The UK\nfinally leaves the EU\ncustoms and is freed from\nthe clasp of Brussels,\nwhich for many in the\ngeneration before us was\na key reason for voting\nLeave.\nThe Tommy Robinson\u2019s (real name Stephen\nYaxley-Lennon), UKIP/\nBNP/EDL supporters,\nand the generally racist\nshould be happy at the\nmore stringent immigration laws in Britain. Even\nbusinesses inside and\nout of the UK should be\nreassured at the prospect\nof a more definite and\nfinal deal being reached,\nrather than the calamity of\na no-deal, hard Brexit. As\nthe border has been a key\nissue in Brexit discussions\nfor some time now, it\nwould show strength and\nstability to finally have\na contingency for this\naspect. And those that\nlive on the Irish/Northern\nIrish border are just glad\nthat they don\u2019t face the\nprospect of having to\nproduce their passports or\nfile for visas just to drop\nthe kids off to school in\nthe mornings or to pick up\na pint of milk across the\nborder.\nEverybody is, admittedly questionably, happy.\nEverybody, bar the Democratic Unionist Party.\nThe DUP defied their\nallies, the Conservatives,\nlast week with a blatant\npolitical warning shot.\nThe DUP, who have 10\nparliament seats, top up\nthe Tories to form the government in a Confidence\nand Supply agreement,\nafter May failed to secure\na majority in the 2017\nsnap election. However,\nthe DUP breached the\narrangement this week\nwhen they voted with\nLabour on a number\nof amendments to the\nFinance Bill, helping\nthem passing through the\nCommons, in response to\nthe latest Irish-Backstop\ndeal. DUP Brexit spokes-man, Sammy Wilson said\n\u201cthe deal breached a fundamental assurance that\nNI would not be treated\nseparately.\u201d He went on to\nsay, \u201cconsequences were\ninevitable,\u201d referring\nto their withholding of\nsupport on the budget\nvote.\nEssentially, the DUP\nhave shown they are not\nafraid to hold the government and the success of\nBrexit for the entire UK\nto ransom if the terms\nof Brexit are not to their\nliking.\nFor many on the\nmainland, this may be too\nmuch to handle. There\u2019s\na part of Ireland that\u2019s\nin the UK? And they\nuse the pound too? (I\u2019ve\noverheard these exact\nquestions be asked on a\nflight to Belfast when a\npassenger was informed\nNI doesn\u2019t use Euros.)\nWho are the DUP, and\nwhat gives them the right\nto dictate our Brexit?\nThe Democratic\nUnionist Party is the\nlargest political party in\nNorthern Ireland and the\nsingle-handed reason for\nwhy Northern Ireland\ncan\u2019t have nice things.\nAre you gay and want\nto get married? Sorry,\nDUP says no.\nAre you gay and want\nto order a cake to console\nyour sadness at not being\nallowed to get married?\nNope, can\u2019t have your\ncake nor eat it either.\nHow about teaching\nscientifically proven\nbasics about the Big\nBang and the origins of\nthe universe to secondary\nschool children? Of course\nnot! However, some\nNI schools are looking\nforward to introducing\nthe BTEC in Flat Earth\nStudies next academic\nyear (Worth 4 A levels!).\nThey believe they can\nbe Northern Ireland\u2019s\nBrexit Champions by\nstalling any deal that\ntreats NI differently to\nBritain, when they can\u2019t\neven be the champion for\ntheir own citizens in basic\nhuman rights. What\u2019s\nfunnier is the DUP think\nthey can lead/dictate the\nUK government during\nthese Brexit talks, yet they\ncan\u2019t even form a basic\ngovernment back home in\nNI.\nOnly recently, Northern\nIreland celebrated setting\na world record for the\nlongest time for a democratic nation to have no\nelected government. How\ndid this happen you ask?\nThe NI Assembly disintegrated after Sinn Fein,\nthe nationalist equivalent\nof the DUP, failed to get\ninto bed with their equally\ndysfunctional partner\n(as required in the Good\nFriday Agreement) after\nit emerged the DUP had\nbeen paying local businesses almost \u00a3500million\nto needlessly keep their\nboilers burning. It\u2019s called\nthe RHI Scandal \u2013 look it\nup! No other government\nin the world, bar Trump,\nwould have survived this\ncolossal fuck up. MLAs\n(NI Assembly Representatives,) to this day, are still\nreceiving pay even though\nno legislation has passed\nsince January 2017.\nThe accountability\nof the DUP is perfectly\nsummarised in their MP\nfor North Antrim, Mr\nIan Paisley Jr. Paisley Jr\nwas suspended from the\nCommons for two weeks\nin September after it was\ndiscovered he had made\nan error of \u201cgross misconduct\u201d when he failed to\ndeclare a bribe from the\nSri Lankan government.\nThe DUP are the\nepitome of political\nignominy and have no\nTwo sides have created an intractable problem for Ireland// Wikimedia\nISSUE 1707\nFELIX\n9\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nUS news is moving like constipated bowels\nUntil the new House sits in January, we won\u2019t have much of anything going on.

They\ntried to arrest each other\nand the situation devolved\ninto a fist fight. This is\nyour brain on drug wars.\nAlright folks, that\u2019s this\nweek done. See you next\ntime for the end of the\nworld.\nright to oppose the government on this deal from\nbehind the tactical facade\nof \u201cprotecting the interests of Northern Ireland\u201d\nwhen they themselves\nfail their constituents on a\ndaily basis.\nThe cause for their\nopposition to the Irish\nBackstop can be found in\na fragile insecure sense of\nBritish identity. I cannot\nstress enough the magnitude of and effect this\ninsecurity has on NI. In\nDecember 2012, Belfast\nCity Council voted to\nreduce the number of days\nthat the Union Flag would\nbe flown over the City\nHall,inaminorcostsaving\nattempt. This technique\nhad already been adopted\nby numerous councils on\nthe mainland. Unionists,\nhowever, believed this an\nattack on the Britishness\nof Northern Ireland and\nsparked two months of\nviolent riots in the capital,\ncosting businesses \u00a350\nmillion in damages and\nlack of sales over the\nfestive period.\nTheir exception to the\nIrish-Backstop deal is\nrooted in their belief that\nthis too is an attack on\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s future\nin the UK. Regardless if a\nhard border in Ireland will\nreturn our economic prospects back to that of the\ntime of the Potato Famine,\nspark a resurgence of IRA\nhostilities (as the Police\nService of NI has warned\nit would) or directly\ndamage the lives of those\nliving on the border, the\nDUP will not settle unless\nNorthern Ireland is treated\nexactly the same as the\nrest of the UK.\nAs a Unionist, I do\nnot fear for the future\nof Northern Ireland in\nthe UK with this deal.\nTheresa May has continuously highlighted NI will\nremain part of the Union\nin this deal for as long\nas we wish to. I will still\nfeel British and retain my\nBritish passport. Life, I\nbelieve, will be largely\nthe same. The economy\nshould remain similar\nthanks to no nasty fuck\nups from a hard border\nand benefits from remaining in the single European\nmarket. Travel to and\nfrom the mainland could\nnot be much harder than\nit currently is. Present an\nidentification document at\nthe airport gate? Already\ndo that. Have my bags\nchecked by customs/\nsecurity? Already do that.\nSubmit to a voluntary\nstrip search? Perhaps not.\nThe border in Gibraltar\nis what I envisage what\nthe Northern Irish border\ncould become. Passengers\noff flights from Gibraltar\nstill have to pass through\ncustoms regardless of the\nfact that most Gibraltarians hold British passports.\nGoods also pass across the\nSpanish border with very\nlittle inspection. It has\nbeen proposed a digital\nsurveillance system could\nbe used in NI to inspect\ncross border movements\nand this would negate\nthe need for any physical\nborder.\nDo not let the DUP\u2019s\ndisproval of the backstop\ndeal miscolour Northern\nIreland in your mind.\nThe NI Chamber of\nCommerce, the Institute of\nDirectors NI, the Director\nof the Civil Service and\nthe Ulster Farmers Union\nall publicly support the\nbackstop agreement.\nLarge business with\nclose logistic links with\nthe Republic such as\nPrimark, McDonald\u2019s\nand Tesco\u2019s have all\nbacked the deal. Some\nconsultancy firms have\nhighlighted the proposed\nstrategic advantage of\nBelfast post-Brexit for\nsimultaneously enjoying\nthe benefits of being\nboth in the UK and EU,\nleading to a potential for\nhuge development in the\ncity.

    "content": "Hello Ian. There are some things that I would like to\ntalk to you about regarding your exhibition\u2026\n... trapping people in the exhibit by not making the exit clear, while clever, does not actually boost attendance\nfigures.\nA\nlone again. I\nhad two tickets.\nVIP ruddy tickets and no one\nbit. Although having been\nto the exhibit, let it not be\nsaid that the students of\nImperial had bad taste. I\njest. Some.\nHislop occupies an\nodd place in our national\nconsciousness. He enjoys\nacting like an outsider,\nhappily jeering at the \u201cestablishment\u201d yet does this\nfrom his position as an\nestablished and comfortable member of it. Even\nhis position as \u201cthe most\nsued person in England\u201d\n(Independent, 2011) does\nlittle to distance him from\nthe people he attacks. A\nwise man once said \u201cA\nBBC panel show does not\nan anarchist make\u201d. In I\nObject, Hislop attempts\nto make a virtue out of\ncocking a snoop at the\npowerful and weaves a\nnarrative through a history\nof people doing so. He\ntries to show that he is\nonly the latest iteration\nin a long line of comics\nand satirists that stretches\nback through history.\nIt is an interesting\nidea and a laudable one.\nThe British Museum\nstands for empire, even\nmore so than Hislop,\nand their willingness to\nacknowledge alternative\nhistories is a positive\ndevelopment. There is,\nhowever, a problem. I am\nnot sure that this narrative\nexists. Cruikshanks, the\n19th century cartoonist\nand icon of Hislop\u2019s (he\nhas written a play about\nhim), features heavily and\ndelights with humorous,\ncrude and colourful depictions of anyone from the\nking to the common man.\nThisisamanafterHislop\u2019s\nheart and it shows.\nHowever, yet again, there\nis a flip side. Cruikshanks\nwas also known for his\nxenophobic views and his\nanti-abolitionist drawings,\ncuriously absent from the\nexhibition.\nAt the other extreme,\nthe woven Afghan rugs\nthat feature Soviet tanks\nand South Korean lino\nprints of elderly, weeping\n\u201cDespite the\nnumerous\nplacards, the\nexhibition\nfeels disjointed\nand lacking in\nunity\u201d\n\u201cIn some\ncases, the lack\nof context is\nirritating and\nhamstrings\nunderstanding\u201d\nworkers are a far cry from\nthe cheeky thumbing\nof the nose that Hislop\naspires to. These are visual\ncries of horror and to place\nthem among cartoons\nshows a misunderstanding\nof the realities in which\nthey were conceived.\nThis means that despite\nthe numerous placards\nand the endless pictures\nof the little man, the exhibition feels disjointed and\nlacking in unity. Not even\nby including the Banksy\nprank \u2013 a slab of concrete\nwith a drawing of a\nprehistoric man pushing\na shopping trolley, put\nup in secret in the British\nMuseum \u2013 can the exhibit\nbe redeemed, nor the irony\ndiminished of such an\nanti-establishment piece\nbeing celebrated. The slab\nlooks instead like a lion\nhead, a trophy on the wall\nthat stares glassily out of\nits case.\nThe exhibition adds\ninsult to injury by putting\non show pieces of government propaganda. The\nremains of a statue made\nspecifically to shame a\nwoman, old fashioned\n\u2018revenge porn\u2019, and a\ncarving of Cleopatra in\na compromising sexual\nposition; these constitute\nnot protest, but state-spon-sored smears. Their inclusion makes a mockery of\nthe exhibition\u2019s purpose\nof highlighting the weak\nattacking the strong\nthroughout history. This\nis a sniggering mix of\nserious and obscene, and\nvisitors get what feels like\na giggling schoolboy\u2019s\ndesk turned upside-down\nto expose graffiti carved\non the underside. The\nscarfed and bespectacled\npublic nods and hums.\n\u2018pussy hat\u2019 is a charged\nobject, even as it sits,\nplonked on a wooden\nmannequin head under\nlights, the yellow umbrella\nof the Hong Kong democracy movement may be a\nless understood symbol\nto some. To show off\nitems that once stood for\nso much without explaining them is a pointless\ngesture. Most people will\nnot be able notice that a\ncharacter is misspelled in\na piece of Chinese calligraphy from the Cultural\nrevolution and even when\ntold will not appreciate its\nsignificance. That requires\na complex understanding\nand too many words for\na small placard. In other\ncases, the lack of context\nis frankly insulting. To\ninclude a coin with the\npope depicted hanging\nfrom some gallows is to\nforget the Catholics that\nwere killed in England\nduring the Gordon riots.\nThis is a celebration\nof a popular Protestant\nanti-Catholic sentiment\nthat should be viewed as a\ndarker part of our history,\nrather than a cheeky side\nnote.\nAll in all, the exhibition\nis boring. Items with their\nlives and vitality wrung\nout of them sit empty\nand without context. You\ncould walk around the\nbizarrely laid-out room\nfor hours and not really\ngain any greater understanding of anything. The\nfunny man seems to have\nforgotten a very basic rule\nof comedy. Once you have\nto put a sign underneath a\npicture explaining that, by\nputting a red hat on Louis\nXVI\u2019s head, the author is\nbeing funny by suggesting\nthat the king was a revo-lutionary, the joke is dead.\nI spy with my private eye // The Guardian\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 30TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n18\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nCalum Drysdale\nArts Editor\nWhere? British Museum\nWhen? Until 10th August\nHow Much? \u00a310; free for\nmembers\nIn some cases, the lack\nof context is irritating and\nhamstrings understanding.\nWhile nearly any modern\nvisitor will be able to\nappreciate how the pink\nWaydown,Hadestown:astoryoflove,lossandwonder\nL\nights went off as\nsoon as I took\nmy seat. Jazzy\nHermes filled the\nstage with snappy tunes\nand energy. He introduced\nEurydice, Orpheus and the\ninevitable tragedy waiting\nto happen in Hadestown,\nthe realm of Hades. A\nGreek myth transported to\na post-apocalyptic Great\nDepression era setting,\nHadestown by Ana\u00efs\nMitchell made me laugh,\ncry and wonder. Disguised\nas a love story, carefree\nOrpheus falls in love with\nstrong willed Eurydice\nonly to lose her again, and\nagain, and again.\nThe story is about\nself-sufficient Eurydice\nwho just craves warmth\nand food in the harsh cold\nwinter. Orpheus who is\nmadly in love with her\nwants to cater for her\nneeds but all he can give\nher is his incomplete song.\nHermes identifies this\nsong as the song of the\ngods, and when Orpheus\nsings, his sweet melody\nmakes flowers bloom\nand winter seem almost\ntolerable. Enchanted by\nthis, Eurydice falls in love\nwith Orpheus who in turn\nhurries to finish his song,\nso winter can end.\nTired of waiting, and\nwith Hades and Persephone\u2019s marital strife,\nEurydice is approached\nby Hades who gives her\nthe choice to sign off her\nsoul to him, so she can\nwork in his factory in\nthe underworld. And she\nagrees. Terrible decision.\nThe premise of the play\nis Orpheus\u2019s adventure to\nsave and bring back his\ngirl.\nUpbeat, energetic\nmusic being a personal\nfavourite, nodding and\ntapping to the beat was\ninevitable. This was also\ntrue for the rest of my row.\nAll performances were\nlively, with Persephone\n(goddess of vegetation and\nHades\u2019 wife), portrayed\nby Amber Grey, giving a\nsensational performance\nand bringing a contagious\npositive energy to every\nsong.\nThe best part of the\nshow was a routine\ndone in the underworld\nwhen the miners chant\nabout their treacherous\nworking conditions and\nPersephone being aghast\nby the industrialism of\nHadestown. The clever set\ndesign made it a spectacle\nbecause of the combination of the awe-factor\nand simplicity. Mining\nlights and a revolving\nplatform conveyed the\nstruggles and problems\nthat everyone \u2013 god or\nsold soul \u2013 has.\nI watched the show\nexpecting to be surprised.\nAnd I was. The unpredictable turns kept me captivated and engaged (more\nthan some lectures I sadly\nadmit). There were times\nwhen the cast would stare\ninto space, but it felt like\nthey were looking straight\nat me so that I, too. was\nsomehow involved. The\noverarching themes of\nunity, revolution and\nrighteousness with the\nsong \u2018Why We Build the\nWall\u2019 are particularly\nrelevant to our times.\nThe character portrayal\nof Orpheus felt like something was amiss. Orpheus\nhad a boyband-ish persona\nwhich made him seem like\nan outsider in comparison\nto a well-knit, classical\ncast. Yet, somehow the\nbeauty of the tragedy and\nthe spectacular routines\nmade this passable.\nThe lost love just\nshowed how easily\nhumans can complicate\nsimple lives. We should\nall just live a little and\nworry less. Possibly by\nwatching the play again,\nand again, and again.\nSwitzerland: Patricia Highsmith is deeply unlikable\u2026\nbut is there more to the iconic author?\nP\natricia Highsmith\n(portrayed by\nPhyllis Logan),\nthe American\nauthor of some of the\nmost beloved murder\nnovels such as Strangers\non a Train and The\nTalented Mr. Ripley,\nis visited by Edward\nRidgeway (Calum Finlay)\nin her retreat bunker in\nSwitzerland. Ridgeway, a\nyoung publisher, has been\nsent there to convince\nHighsmith to write one\nfinal Ripley novel.\nThe production is thrilling and captivates the audience from the get-go. As\nthe exchange between the\ncharacters heats up and\ncools down, as the dynamics change, the tension is\ntruly palpable. This is, for\nthe most part, thanks to\nthe wonderful acting by\nLogan and Finlay, who\nportray two very unlikea-ble characters. Highsmith\nespecially is made to be as\nunlikeable as possible in\nthis production, spewing\nhate with each sentence\nthat comes out.\nThe stage design is\nparticularly unwelcom-ing and fits the theme and\nthe characterisation per-fectly. There is a sense of\nunease even prior to the\nactors taking centre stage.\nThe Swiss Alps visual in\nthe background is slightly tacky, though. Maybe\na little too on-the-nose\nfor my liking, driving the\npoint that we are, in fact,\nin Switzerland. It\u2019s not\nlike they never mention it\nthroughout the play.\nThe play is far from\nperfect, with little character development up until the climax. Even then,\nthere isn\u2019t much giving\nthese characters a third\ndimension. All we know\nis Highsmith is a nasty\nwoman, and Ridgeway is\na young, charming pub-lisher. Yes, for those familiar with Highsmith\u2019s\nwork, Ridgeway does\nin fact present a striking\nsimilarity to Tom Ripley,\nalthough this is a tad too\nsubtle for those who are\nnot. The twist near the end\nmay be a bit confusing for\nthe latter group, although\nwhen it happens, it\u2019s not\nexactly a shocker; though\na chilling conclusion to a\nthrilling plot, it isn\u2019t particularly surprising.\nIn conclusion, Switzerland is, on paper, a wonderful idea, exploring\nthe author\u2019s relationship\nwith her most beloved\ncharacter. In practice,\nthough, it is let down by\nthe script which does not\nallow for character development and relies on\nthe audience being familiar with Highsmith\u2019s\nwork. The actors deliver a\nhigh-quality performance\nwith the script they have\nbeen handed. While the\nplay does make for an\nentertaining evening\nout, and might leave you\nwanting to sift through\nHighsmith\u2019s catalogue, it\ndoesn\u2019t do much more.\nBeauty and Tragedy // National Theatre\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 30TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n19\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nDisha Bandyopadhyay\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Well, let\nme just say that, not only\ndid I see War Horse twice,\nI saw it twice in a single\nweek.\nReturning to National\nTheatre eleven years\nafter its initial debut, to\ncommemorate the 100th\nanniversary of Armistice\nDay, War Horse explores\nthe bond between young\nAlbert and his beloved\nhorse Joey.\nAdapted to stage from\nMichaelMorpurgo\u2019snovel\nof the same name by Nick\nStafford, and directed by\nMarianne Elliott and Tom\nMorris, the play is unlike\nanything I have seen on\nstage before. The biggest\nprops, perhaps, goes out\nto the Handspring Puppet\nCompany, though. From\nthe first moment Joey\nappears on stage as a foal,\nI had chills. Imagine my\ndisbelief the moment he\nappears as a full-grown\nhorse moments later,\nmoving so realistically,\nwith so much personal-ity, that I immediately\nstarted crying. I cried\nat how realistic a horse\npuppet was. It was that\nrealistic. Throughout the\nplay, there\u2019s this weird\nawareness of the fact that\nthese \u2018horses\u2019 (yes, there\nare multiple, and they are\nall amazing, with individual personalities) are fake,\nalthough within moments\nyou learn to suspend these\nthoughts, convincing\nyourself that these are real,\nliving animals on stage.\nAnd with the intricacy\nshown by the incredible\npuppeteering company, it\nreally isn\u2019t that hard to do\nso.\n\u201cWar Horse\nexplores the\nbond between\nyoung Albert\nand his\nbeloved horse\nJoey.\u201d\n\u201cThe war\nscenes are\nperfectly\nexecuted,\nwith just the\nright amount\nof gruesome,\nholding a\nmirror to the\nugly realities\nof warfare.\u201d\nHorses are not the only\nanimal puppets in the play.\nThe decision to include\nbirds here and there add\na wonderful touch of\nnature, and the goose acts\nas a much-needed comic\nrelief, that never takes\naway from the serious\ntone of the play.\nThe play is magnificently paced; there\u2019s never\nreally a dull moment as\nthe characters (human and\npuppet) are continuously\nthrown new obstacles to\novercome. Not only do\nthese build up in terms\nof intensity throughout\nthe play, putting more at\nstakes for the characters,\nthey also allow for a hefty\namount of foreshadowing,\nand subtle call-backs to\nprevious events.\nThe war scenes are\nperfectly executed, with\njust the right amount\nof gruesome, holding a\nmirror to the ugly realities\nof warfare. These scenes\nare loud and intense and\nhad me at the edge of my\nseat.\nThe acting is also great,\nwith a special shout-out\nto Thomas Dennis, who\nreally manages to portray\nAlbert\u2019s youth and innocence beautifully, and Jo\nCastleton, who delivers\nan emotionally packed\nperformance as Albert\u2019s\nmother, Rose Naracott.\nWithout giving too much\naway, Rose\u2019s reactions\nand feelings towards\ncertain events in the play\nare perhaps the most\ngut-wrenching of all.\nAlthough not a musical,\nthere is bits of singing dispersed through the show.\nAt first, I wasn\u2019t fully sold\non these, as I wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat they really added,\nbut by the interval, I was\non board. They still don\u2019t\nfeel like an integral part of\nthe play, but I did enjoy\nthe commentary they\nprovided. Additionally,\nI think they also helped\npace the play, dispersing\nand adding tension as\nneeded.\nOverall, if I was to sum\nup the play with a single\nword, it would be mag-netising. The play moved\nme deeply from the first\nmoment until its last, and\nI wept like a baby. War\nHorse is a combination\nof everything I love about\ntheatre, and each aspect is\nexpertly curated to work\nlike magic. Morpurgo\u2019s\nnovel might be widely\nclassified as a children\u2019s\nnovel, although on stage,\nWar Horse is not only a\nplay suitable for everyone,\ntt is a play that should be\nseen by everyone (above\nthe age of 10, according\nto National Theatre).\nSo deeply moving and\neffective, the play stays\nwith the viewer long\nafter leaving the theatre.\nIf there is a single play I\nwould recommend anyone\nto see this year in London,\nit would undoubtedly be\nWar Horse. Playing at\nNational Theatre until\nJanuary 2019, War Horse\nis a not-to-be-missed\nvisual and emotional\nspectacle that any theatre\nenthusiast should get to\nwitness.\nA scene from the play// Brinkhoff/Moegenburg\nARTS\nOzbil Dumenci\nArts Writer\nWhere?

As the lights erupt\nand the Christmas spirit\nenvelops the nation, it\ntruly is a special time\nof the year. However, it\nmakes me value the importance of family and\nthe sanctity of life for a\nvery different reason.\ncontemplating career\nchoices and planning New\nYear\u2019s Parties, I pause for\na moment to appreciate\nhow phenomenally lucky\nI am to still be here today.\nOn Boxing Day 2004, I\nwas in Galle, Sri Lanka,\none of the cities worst\naffected by the tsunami.\nback during the holidays\nto visit my family and\nfriends. In 2004, my elder\nbrother, my mum and I\ntravelled to Sri Lanka for a\n3-week holiday spanning\nChristmas and the New\nYear. My dad was tied\ndown at work and had to\nstay home in Norwich.\nOn Boxing Day 2004, I\nwas woken up at 6 am by\nmy mum. We were in my\nuncle\u2019s house in Colombo,\nthe capital of Sri Lanka.\nOnce I got through the\ninitial confusion of being\nwoken up so early, I was\novercome with excite-ment. We had planned to\ngo on a two-day trip to a\ncoastal town on the south\ncoast called Tissa. This\nmeant pools, beaches\nand ball games \u2013 what\nmore could an 8-year-old\nwant? The travelling party\nconsisted of my brother,\nmum, two cousins, aunt,\nuncle and myself.\nWe travelled along\nthe south-west coast\n- world-famous for its\ngolden beaches, exuberant marine life and surfing\nopportunities. I watched\ninquisitively as the fishermen brought in their\nmorning\u2019s catch \u2013 little\ndid I realise that, for many\nof them, this would be\ntheir last day\u2019s work. At\naround 9 am, we took a pit\nstop in Galle, one of the\nlargest cities in the south\nof Sri Lanka. Galle is a\nbustling city embellished\nwith a giant 16th\ncentury\nfort, overlooking the Galle\nInternational Cricket\nStadium. We parked the\nvan outside \u2018Food City\u2019,\na supermarket much like\nSainsbury\u2019s or Tesco, as\nmy mum wanted to get\nsome snacks for the rest\nof the journey. Initially,\nmy mum was going to go\nwith my uncle, leaving me\nin the van with my brother\nand cousins. However, she\nthen said something that,\nand out of the aisles like\na hyperactive PacMan\nuntil I found my target. I\nwas stood in front of the\nbiscuits aisle, expertly\nperusing the range, when I\nheard my mum screaming.\nI ran towards my mum,\nwho was stood in front of\na large glass window, and\nI was shocked by what\nI saw. The city of Galle,\nwas submerged in 15\nfeet of dark, violent sea\nwater. Innocent people\nwere being thrown around\nlike rag dolls. Buses, cars\nand tuk-tuks were being\nflung into buildings, as\nif they were weightless\ntoys. Amidst this chaos, I\nsaw something even more\nterrifying.

We watched,\nhelplessly, as people tried\nto clamber up buildings\nto get to safety, only to\nbe mercilessly swatted\naway by the waves. As\ntime went on, the hysteria\ntransformed into frank\nconsideration of how my\nlife would be without my\nbrother \u2013 thoughts that are\nbeyond the usual remit\nof an 8-year-old. \u2018We\nwill never play cricket\ntogether again, he\u2019ll never\nsee me go to university,\nI\u2019ll never see him get\nmarried\u2019\u2013 each simulation\nof his absence making it\ntantly appointed widows,\nwidowers and orphans,\nflooding every nook and\ncranny. A second and\nthird wave had struck the\ncity, deepening wounds\nand quashing hope. Then,\n4 hours after the ordeal\nbegan, our prayers were\nanswered. A soldier, who\nhad been called to the city\nat this time of crisis, came\nto me and my mum, and\ntold us that my brother was\nsafe, and had been taken\nto the house of a local\nfamily on high ground. He\nwas with my two cousins.\nMy mum and I were\novercome by an intense\nsoldiers and reunited with\nmy brother.\nOnce our emotions\nwere finally under control,\nmy brother told us of his\nexperience. As the water\nstarted sweeping the van\ndown the streets of Galle\nand the possibility of\ndrowning became very\nreal, my brother smashed\nthe window and they all\ncrawled out. At this point,\nthe powerful torrents separated them. My brother got\nentangled underwater in a\nweb of fallen telephone\ncables, causing a large\nlaceration on his back. He\nmanaged to wriggle out\nonly to be swept towards\na canal running through\nthe city. The canal was\na particularly dangerous\narea \u2013 vehicles, rubble and\npeople were being sucked\nin as if it were a black\nhole. If you were swept\ninto the canal, that was it.\nMy brother was pushed\ntreacherously close,\nhowever, he managed\nto hoist himself onto a\ntree by the side of the\ncanal. One of my cousins,\nsimilarly, grabbed onto a\ntree trunk whilst the other\ndrifted close enough to\nmy brother, such that he\ncould pull her up onto the\ntree. Once the waters had\ncalmed, they were taken to\nsafety at a nearby church.\nMy aunt had been swept\nover a kilometre before\nlatching onto a fence and\nbeing taken to safety.\nRather unexpectedly,\nmy uncle, who entered the\nwater after the first wave\nhad struck, was worst\ninjured. He had badly cut\nhis foot and lost a lot of\nblood. He was found unconscious and taken to a\nlocal doctor who managed\nto dress his wound and\nresuscitate him. In the\nevening, once the water\nhad receded for the last\nthe mighty power of the\nsea. 6 minutes, and the\noutcome could have been\nvery, very different.\nEvery December, I stop\nto think about the 230,000\nlives that were lost and\nthe many millions of\nlives that were irreparably\ndestroyed that day. If not\nfor a very fine margin, my\nfamily could have contributed to that total. As we\nlive our pleasant lives in\nLondon we may complain\nabout coursework, exams,\nrelationships and all sorts\n\u2013 when the going is (rela-tively) easy we often find\nsomething (relatively)\npetty to pin our dissatisfaction on. It\u2019s almost as\nif humans have an in-built\ndissatisfaction quota that\nmust be fulfilled and it\nis often allocated to the\nleast pleasing thing in our\nlives at the time. I\u2019m not\ntrying to undermine issues\n\u2018lesser\u2019 in magnitude than\na natural disaster \u2013 these\nproblems are, of course,\nof utmost importance to\nthe individual who suffers\n\u201cIf the tsunami\nhad struck 6\nminutes earlier\nor 6 minutes\nlater, our van\nmay have been\non the road in\nthick traffic\u201d\ntime, we were taken by an\narmy convoy to pick up\nmy uncle and head back\nto Colombo. Thanks to\nthe time difference, my\ndad was fast asleep whilst\nall of this unfolded. As he\nunassumingly switched on\nBBC news in the morning,\nhe was met with ghastly\nimages of apocalyptic\ndestruction with mounting\ndeath tolls in South Asia.\nFortunately, by the time\nhe called us, we were all\nsafe and sound. Reflecting\nupon this experience\nchurns an eclectic collection of emotions. The\nintense feelings of potential loss that burdened me\nthat day are juxtaposed\nby the elation that we\nsurvived against all odds.\nMy mum and I had been\nin Food City for no more\nthan 5 minutes before\nthe tsunami struck. We\nwere intending to be in\nthere for no more than\n5 minutes. Therefore, if\nthe tsunami had struck\n6 minutes earlier or 6\nminutes later, our van may\nhave been on the road in\nthick traffic, vulnerable to\n\u201cInnocent\npeople were\nbeing thrown\naround like rag\ndolls\u201d\n\u201cBuses, cars\nand tuk-tuks\nwere being\nflung into\nbuildings, as\nif they were\nweightless\ntoys\u201d\nfeeling of relief. All those\npiercing thoughts that\nwere tormenting me will,\nthankfully, never enter\nthe realm of reality. We\nwere then escorted by the\nprogressively harder for\nme to breathe or think.\nMy uncle was in a\nparticularly bad state. His\nentire family was in the\nwater, unaccounted for.\nHe made the courageous\ndecision (arguably, his\nonly option) to enter the\nwater to search for his\nfamily. My mum and I\nremained in Food City,\npraying to Gods we didn\u2019t\nroutinely believe in, to\nperform a miracle on\nour behalf.

Abridged by\nMoira Buffini and directed by Natasha Nixon, it\ncertainly is an intriguing\npremise! I had the opportunity to sit down with\nOlivia and Isabel and find\nout their thoughts on the\nproduction.\nThis interview has been\nedited and condensed for\nclarity.\nQ: It\u2019s a very new\nproduction of Macbeth.\nThe whole idea is that\nit\u2019s genderfluid \u2013 what\nexactly does that mean in\nthe context of the play?\nI: We use the term\ngenderfluid to refer specifically to the casting, in\nthat characters who have\nbeen traditionally played\nby men can be female,\nand vice versa. So two\nof the witches are male,\nand Macbeth is a woman,\nwhich is very exciting.\nQ: I was just wondering\nabout the casting \u2013 are\nthere specific decisions to\nmake certain characters\nmale and certain characters female? Macbeth is\nfemale, but Lady Macbeth\nremains female \u2013 it\u2019s not\nlike a genderswap.\nI:You\u2019dhavetospeakto\nthe creative team to know\nthe whys and wherefores,\nbut I think the idea was\nthat they wanted to get the\nbest actor for each role, regardless of gender. Except\nfor Macbeth. It was very\nmuch the idea that they\nwanted a female Macbeth\nand a queer relationship\n\u2013 a relationship between\ntwo women \u2013 at the heart\nof the production.\nQ: So the relationship\nbetween Macbeth and\nLady Macbeth is a queer\nrelationship.\nO: Yes. They\u2019re\nmarried, just as they are in\nthe conventional Macbeth.\nBut I think it\u2019s interesting\nthat Macduff and Banquo\nare male, and Macbeth is\nfemale. She\u2019s a warrior\namongst male warriors, so\nwhat does that say, what\nquestions does it bring\nabout for the audience? It\ncould have been a totally\ndifferent play if Macduff\nwas also female. But here\nit\u2019s still a man\u2019s world,\nespecially on the battlefield \u2013 there are moments\nin the play where we still\nuse the language \u201cI dare\ndo all that may become\na man\u201d, and, \u201cWhat, are\nyou a man?\u201d\nQ: That\u2019s very interest-ing, is it supposed to be\nthe original script? In the\noriginal text, there are so\nmany references to gender\nand \u2018manliness\u2019 \u2013 Lady\nMacbeth tells Macbeth\nto man up and do things.\nHow is that going to\nwork now that Macbeth is\nfemale?\nI: Yes, it\u2019s absolutely\nthe original text. Moira\u2019s\nstreamlined it a little but\nall the famous speeches,\nthe dynamics of every\nsingle moment of the\noriginal text are still there.\nO: Well, we\u2019ve sourced\nback to it! I mean, she\n(Isabel) says \u201cAre you a\nman?\u201d and I say, \u201cAye,\nand a bold one\u201d. It still\nexists! It is still a patriarchal world and that is\nstill currency between\nus. Whether that\u2019s a dig,\nyou know, like \u201cAre you\na man?\u201d, as if that would\nbe an insult, or it\u2019s like,\nstill \u201cman up\u201d because\nthat\u2019s seen as power. To\nbe manly, to be masculine,\nwe still use that language.\nI: Absolutely. And\nI think what\u2019s really\ninteresting about having\nboth Macbeth and Lady\nMacbeth as women is that\nMacbeth has chosen for\nher life path to lead into\nthe military, and she very\nmuch judges herself based\non masculine standards.\nWhereas Lady Macbeth\nplays a more domestic\nrole \u2013 she\u2019s chosen to\nbe the partner to a very\nhigh-flying person rather\nthan to be the high-flying\nperson herself. It complicates things, certainly,\nbut also makes it more\ninteresting.\nQ: Okay. So the play\nwas centred around\nMacbeth being female\nand the queer relationship\nbetween her and Lady\nMacbeth, and the rest\nof the cast just fell into\nplace?\nI: Yeah, I would say\nthat was more or less the\nshape of things. There\nwere certain central tenets\nof what we wanted to\nmake the production, but\nthen it becomes a creative\nproject \u2013 finding what\nfeels the most true and\ninteresting and fruitful.\nO: Definitely. And\nthings arose within that \u2013\nfor example, Fleance, who\nis traditionally Banquo\u2019s\nson, is now his daughter.\nOne of the prophecies is\nthat Banquo\u2019s children\nwill be kings, and that\u2019s\nquite interesting, because\nFleance doesn\u2019t know it\nyet, but she\u2019s going to be\nqueen. I really like that at\nthe end the fight still continues for power, between\ngenders and between\nhumans.\nI: Moira\u2019s not just pared\nit down, she\u2019s played\nmore of a functional\nrole. There are things in\nthe production, like the\nstage directions, where\nyou can see what her interpretation of the play is\nand what she hopes ours\nwill be. Things that you\nwouldn\u2019t necessarily infer\nfrom the original text. It\u2019s\nbeen really fun bringing\nthem out and staging them\nin a way that\u2019s true to the\noriginal script but also\nexpresses Moira\u2019s vision\nof it.\nO: I think it makes it\nvery rich. Hopefully as an\naudience member you\u2019re\nshown not only the main\nstory but also the subtext,\nwhich is brought to the\nsurface in flashes. There\u2019s\nso much I think you can\nglean from it, which is\nwhyIthinkshe\u2019s[Moira\u2019s]\nsprinkled certain extra\nthings around as well.\nQ: Playing a female\nMacbeth, what sort of\ninterpretation do you feel\nyou could bring to the role\nthat mightn\u2019t be possible\nwith a more traditional\nmale Macbeth?\nO: It\u2019s really interest-ing. I have to confess\nthat I\u2019ve never seen\nMacbeth played before,\nso to answer that question\nhonestly I feel like I have\nto tell you that first. But\nwhat\u2019s my interpretation?\nIt\u2019s all from the text,\nreally \u2013 she\u2019s so complex.\nYes, she\u2019s a murderer,\nwe kind of refer to her\nas almost psychopathic,\nbut she\u2019s not. She feels\nso deeply about her wife,\nshe\u2019s married, she has to\nwork really hard at her\njob to earn the status of\nworthy warrior, Bellona\u2019s\ndaughter, the goddess of\nwar \u2013 her work ethic\u2019s\nOlivia Dowd as Macbeth and Isabelle Adomakoh Young as Lady Macbeth // The Other Richard\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nISSUE 1707\nFELIX\n21\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cAt the end\nthe fight still\ncontinues\nfor power,\nbetween\ngenders and\nbetween\nhumans\u201d\nreally shown us that the\nrole isn\u2019t limited to being\nplayed by a man \u2013 but\nrather playing the character truthfully and bringing\nthe best to what is a very\ninteresting character. I\ndon\u2019t know how useful\nit is to look for female\nstereotypes to crowbar\ninto that \u2013 I think seeing\nMacbeth being played\nby a woman is pure and\npowerful in itself.\nQ: So it\u2019s not that\nthere\u2019s anything particularly different about a\nfemale Macbeth, it\u2019s just\nMacbeth who happens\nto be played by a female\nactor.\nO: Definitely. And it\u2019s\nbeen such an incredible\nopportunity to have been\ncast as Macbeth \u2013 to have\nbeen cast as this utterly\ncomplex, happy, sad,\ntyrannical overthinker,\nlover, whatever \u2013 it\u2019s\nreally made me think. And\nthis isn\u2019t anything new,\nbut what I hope it will\ndo for people watching\nis to ask, why don\u2019t other\nwomen get the chance to\nplay complex characters\nlike this? I think it reveals\nthe spectrum of humanity,\nor the spectrum of gender,\nthat you just don\u2019t get to\nsee enough.\nQ: Is there a huge\nfocus on gender in this\nproduction, or is it just\na regular production of\nMacbeth that happens to\nbe played by male and\nfemale actors?\nI: It\u2019s a huge creative\ndecision to take a gen-der-fluid approach, but\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about\ntrying to make people read\ncertain things into it. Each\nactor will know what their\ngender is contributing to\ntheir playing of the role,\nbut it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve\ndecided, for example, that\nQueen Duncan should be\nvery effeminate. It\u2019s very\ndeliberate, but it\u2019s subtle.\nO: Yes. I hope that\npeople will be able to\ncome and glean things\nfrom the gender structure,\nor whatever it is in this\nproduction, themselves.\nWhich is actually, in my\nopinion, much better.\nI: There isn\u2019t a specific\nmessage we\u2019re trying to\nbring across by saying,\nfor example, Donalbain is\nfemale. It\u2019s about learning\nwhat we can learn from\nsomething which hasn\u2019t\nreally been done before,\nand it\u2019s been a process of\ndiscovery for us \u2013 finding\nout along the way what\na female Macbeth might\nmean. We\u2019re still finding\nstuff out.\nQ: Genderswapped\nor genderfluid casting is\nquite popular nowadays.\nDo you think there should\nbe a reason to deviate\nfrom the genders the playwright has set out? Or do\nyou think casting should\njust be more genderfluid,\nand that anyone should\nplay whatever they want?\nO: I don\u2019t know. For me\nit\u2019s always case-by-case\n\u2013 depending on what the\nstory is and how it could\nbe made more relevant by\nopening up the gender.\nI: Yeah, it depends on\nthe show so much. There\nare certain things \u2013 and\npeople talk about this with\nrace as well \u2013 where if the\nstory is about a character\u2019s experience of having\na particular identity, then\nobviously it\u2019s a really\nbig decision to alter that.\nI\u2019m not going to say\nhypothetically whether\nthat decision is right or\nwrong, but, you know,\nit\u2019s one step to take. But\nI think when it\u2019s a story\nabout ambition, and love,\nand what people will do to\nget something \u2013 there\u2019s no\nreason why that shouldn\u2019t\nbe explored in a different way. In fact I think\nthere\u2019s every reason why\nit should be. And for me,\neven just seeing casting\nopen up recently has\nbrought so much to plays\nthat I thought I knew well.\nO: It\u2019s theatre. You\u2019re\ntelling a story, and you\u2019re\ntaking people away from\ntheir everyday lives and\nmaking them believe that\nOseloka Obi as Macduff and Olivia Dowd as Macbeth // The Other Richard\ngreat! She\u2019s strong, but\nshe also loves her wife\nand she\u2019s ambitious. So\nmy interpretation is to\nbring all those things\nto the surface while\nalso allowing a kind of\nsoftness. I don\u2019t really\nknow what it\u2019s like for\na man to play it but I\ncertainly know that our\n[Macbeth and Lady\nMacbeth\u2019s] bond\u2026\nThe end of the play,\n\u201cTomorrow, tomorrow\nand tomorrow\u2026\u201d is\nreally, really sad \u2013 and\nyes, it\u2019s nihilistic, but I\nfeel it. I can\u2019t help but\nfeel that speech. And yes,\nshe stifles those feelings,\nbecause she\u2019s lost her\nmind, she\u2019s killed so\nmany people, she\u2019s lost\nher wife and she\u2019s wondering what\u2019s left. So my\ninterpretation is that she\nfeels these things.\nQ: Does that tie in to\nwhat you\u2019ve said about\nhow girls have to stifle\nemotions and appear very\noutwardly strong or take\non masculine roles?\nI: I can certainly see\nsome parallels to that, but\nI feel that Macbeth is kind\nof about that anyway.\nWhen you see Macbeth\nhaving all these second\nthoughts and doubts and\nforging ahead anyway,\nthat\u2019s very human.\nStaging Macbeth with\na female Macbeth, it\u2019s\nthere\u2019s a world on stage.\nThere are so many things\nthat we\u2019re used to just\naccepting, we could go\na bit quicker with telling\nthem in different ways.\nWith different people.\nI: Like, these rules\nare only necessary for as\nlong as they\u2019re useful and\ninteresting, right?\nLook out for Felix Arts\u2019\nreview of Macbeth next\nweek!\nWhere? The Garrick Theatre\nWhen? Until 7th Dec\nHow Much? From \u00a315\ninterview with the star couple\n\n"

The additional\nnumbers were welcome,\nbut we are still looking to\nrecruit.\nAfter a bit of special\nteam tactical adjustments\nand an extended warm-up\nfeaturing everyone\u2019s\nfavourite Zip-Drill punctuated by Frans\u2019 usual\nmoans about his shoulder.\nBoth teams were ready to\ntake the field. Unfortunately, due to a flag on the\nfield for delay of medics\nthe game started late. The\nVipers hit us hard on their\nfirst drive, mostly due\nto their girth-y statures,\nand finished with a\ntouchdown. However, we\nresponded with a 60-yard\ndrive of our own that unfortunately was cut short\nat the foot of the end-zone\ndue to a holding penalty\non one of our players.\nOn defence, we reacted\nwith an excellent fumble\nrecovery by Nikolai\n\u201cSmice\u201d Smirnov to set\nthe offence up on Queen\nMary\u2019s 40-yard line, and\nhoping to pound the ball\ninto close vicinity of the\nend-zone. Unfortunately,\na couple of drops in the\nred zone meant we were\nunable to capitalise. At the\nend of the half our defence\nsuffered two lapses which\nlead to two Viper TDs\nin the last minute of the\nhalf, putting the score\nat 24-0. Undeterred,\nwe came back out and\nscored a touchdown of\nour own, with a catch by\nDaniel \u201cOld Windsorian\u201d\nLoughran, who redeemed\nhimself after a particularly pathetic false start on\nthe previous play. On the\nfollowing QMBL drive,\nEd \u201cBallhawk\u201d Martin\nproduced an insane pick\n6 that included five shed\ntackles, making the score\n24-14 halfway through\nthe third quarter. For\nthe rest of the game\nthe defences reigned\nsupreme, apart from an\namazing one-minute drill\ndown that went for 80\nyards and ran out of time\nat the 5-yard line. This\nlast minute effort included\na 35-yard scramble by\nour QB Ben O\u2019Brien, and\ndeep contested catch by\n\u201cMagic\u201d Mike Corio. Unfortunately, this still meant\na defeat for us. However,\nthere were plenty of positives to be taken away\nfrom the game, with our\noffence having made\nmore yards than the Vipers\nand our defence looking\nvery robust apart from\nright before half-time. A\nspecial shout-out goes to\nThomas \u201cFlipper\u201d Smith\nfor fulling transitioning to\nhis new offensive lineman\nrole.\nWith a bye-week in our\nsights, we are looking at\nimproving even more and\ncreating an upset against\nKent in mother Harlington before the mid-season\nbreak.

It has emerged that\nthe Abu Dhabi investment\nfund has filed a lawsuit\nin New York, claiming\nthat Goldman bribed\nMohammed al-Husseiny,\nchief executive of Aabar,\nto make them act against\nthe funds interests as\npart of \u201ca massive, international conspiracy\nto embezzle billions of\ndollars\u201d from 1MBD. It\nis then no surprise that\nGoldman\u2019s image has\ntaken a significant hit in\nSoutheast Asia, taking\n17th spot for fees as of the\nstart of November, as the\nMalaysian ruling coalition\nfaces up to $10bn in debt\nrepayments linked to the\n1MBD scandal in time\nwhen it is grappling with\na weak fiscal position,\nhaving revised the 2018\nfiscal deficit from 2.8% to\n3.7% in the latest budget\nissued in early November.\nGoldman could\nperhaps recover if it was\nan isolated incident,\n\u201cthe likely\nfuture Prime\nMinster Anwar\nIbrahim has\ncondemned\nGoldman\nSachs role in\nthe scandal as\n\u201cdisgusting\u201d \u201c\nall time. The purpose of\nthe fund set up by Najib\nRazak, Malaysia\u2019s Prime\nMinister in 2009, was to\npromote economic devel-opment. According to the\nDepartment of Justice,\nat least $3.5 billion was\nstolen from this fund and\nhad found its way into\nthe hands of Najib and\nmany of his associates,\nto help in the purchase\nof a luxury apartment in\nManhattan, a corporate\njet, and ironically even\nhelped finance the movie\nThe Wolf of Wall Street.\nGoldman enters the picture 10 years ago, when it\naimed to target Southeast\nAsia as part of its regional\nexpansion. The bank\nbuilt relationships with\nMalaysian tycoons and\nthe government of Najib\nRazak. Consequently,\nstate run 1MBD hired\nGoldman to work on\n$6.5bn in bond deals\nthat reeled in $600m in\nfees, an unusually high\nrate for the service. Now\nAnwar Ibrahim, the likely\nfuture prime minister,\nhas condemned Goldman\nSachs\u2019 role in the scandal\nas \u201cdisgusting\u201d and has\ndemanded that the bank\nshould return significantly\nmore than the $600m the\nbanks were paid, due to the\nfact that \u201cit\u2019s a cost to the\nThe soveriegn wealth fund was supposed to bring economic prosperity to Malaysia// Financial Times\nGoldman\u2019s share price has suffered as a result of the scandal// Financial Times\nScandals raises questions over Goldman Conduct\nhowever, on Wednesday\nSouth Korea\u2019s financial\nregulator imposed a\n$6.7m fine on the bank for\nconducting a type of short\nselling that is banned in\nthe country. The question\nGoldman must be asking\nthemselves now is\nwhether this new scandal\nthreatens to undermine\nGoldman\u2019s claims to be\ncleaner and more ethical,\nand whether its leaders\nhave lost control of their\nempire amid their pursuit\nof growth.\n\n"

With the\nfirst term in White City\ndrawing to a close, Felix\nreached out to various\nstaff and students across\nall levels of the Chemistry department, from\nundergraduate student to\npostdoctoral researcher\nand beyond, and invited\nthem to reflect on their\nexperiences of the new\nbuilding and campus.\nThe two questions that\nwere asked were, \u201chow\nhave you found the move\nto White City in this\nfirst term?\u201d and \u201cwhat\nissues have you seen/\nexperienced associated\nwith the move to White\nCity\u201d.\nIn a staff briefing sent\nout via e-mail on Friday\n16th November, Professor\nAlan Armstrong, Head of\nthe Department of Chemistry, was quite positive\nabout the move to White\nCity. Although acknowledging that \u201cno move is\neasy\u201d and recognising that\nthere have been \u201cteething\nproblems\u201d, Professor\nArmstrong enthused\nabout the open layouts for\noffice and write-up areas,\nwhich \u201cprovide a great\ncontrast\u201d to the buildings\nin South Kensington and\n\u201callow greatly improved\ninteractions between\nresearchers, which is\nalready leading to better\ncollaborative working\nand cross-pollination of\nideas\u201d. Although many\nof the staff contacted by\nFelix shared Professor\nArmstrong\u2019s sentiment\nthat many of his colleagues have been \u201cstruck\nmost by how the building\nreally has changed\u201d the\nway they interact with\neach other, this rather\nglowing assessment of the\nmove to White City has\nnot proved to be accurate\namongst the majority of\nstaff.\nconfusing information\nsurrounding logistics of\npacking of equipment/\nchemicals etc.\u201d\nThis member of staff\u2019s\ncomplaints were consistent with a number of\nother members of staff\nand also with many of the\nstudents and researchers\nthat have been relocated\nto the new building. One\nmajor recurring issue was\nthe general feeling that\nthe move to White City\nwas poorly managed. One\npost-doctoral researcher\nreflected on the \u201cserious\nissues in the planning and\nhandling of the moving\nprocess\u201d as follows:\n\u201cInformation passed\non to us earlier this year\nfrom people involved in\nthe planning process was\nthat a \u2018one size fits all\u2019\npolicy had been applied\nto building design, i.e.\nall floors will be built to\nnear-identical specification and corrections made\nas and when necessary.\nThe diversity of research\nrequirements in the\ndepartment makes this\na totally infeasible ap-proach. This has affected\nboth our ability to settle\nin to the new facilities,\nand the rate at which other\nissues can be addressed.\u201d\nThe Molecular Sciences Research Hub in White City // Joseph O'Connell-Danes\n\u201cI'm pretty\ndisgruntled\nby the lack of\nhelp and lack\nof caring over\nthis\u201d\n\u201cProbably the\nmain issue is\nthe amount of\ntime that we\nlost\u201d\nand getting everything\nacross to White City has\nchallenging. I think, given\nthat complexity, it\u2019s generally gone as well as you\ncan expect. Recognising\nwhat a complex scenario\nwe had, it was inevitable\nthat there were going to\nbe some things that aren\u2019t\nperfect and it was actually\npretty good.\u201d\nOne major issue that\nstemmed from the perceived mismanagement\nof the move is the significant loss of time while\nmoving. That is to say,\nthe move caused large\nperiods of \u201cdowntime\u201d,\nduring which research\ngroups were unable to\nconduct any research and\nwere, instead, assisting\nwith the relocation of\nlabs. One member of staff\nadded, \u201cmost students had\nto take at least 3 months to\nprepare, relocate and set\nup their laboratory space.\nHowever some were\naffected more than others,\nparticularly students\nwhere there was only 1 or\n2 group members responsible to move an entire\nlaboratory.\u201d\nThis sentiment was\nshared with a particular\npost-doctoral researcher\nwho provided Felix with a\ncomment:\n\u201cI get the impression\nthere probably should\nhave been better planning\nin the initial stages. Our\nimpression has been pretty\ngood actually. There have\nbeen problems. Some\nof our equipment took\na month after we had\nmoved to arrive. It\u2019s kind\nof essential to what we do.\nSo effectively for a month\nwe couldn\u2019t work as we\nnormally would have\nbeen working. Compared\nto other people it\u2019s not\nthat bad but again it\u2019s\nnot great for us. We\u2019ve\nhad a bit of downtime\non each side. There was\nsort of disrupted works.\nSome groups have had 3\nmonths downtime. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s been particularly\nwell managed. Obviously\nthe completing of the\nbuilding and stuff was\nrelatively planned far in\nadvance but I think things\nlike where each individual\ngroup was going and what\nequipment and spacewas\nneeded was last minute so\nI think that\u2019s probably a\nlarge source of a number\nof the problems.\u201d\nreimbursement. This has\nbeen a source of major\nconfusion, particularly for\npost-doctoral researchers\nwho are still not completely aware whether the\ndepartment or the College\nwill provide any sort of\nfinancial reimbursement\nfor lost time. Some researchers even went so far\nas to accuse the College\nof a misappropriation of\nfunds given for research\nprojects. \u201cWe were given\nmoney to look at developing drugs for cancer\nand Alzheimers research\nand not to cover a relocation budget shortfall by\nmoving boxes.\u201d\nPost-doctoral research-ers, who work on a fixed\nterm contract, were left in\nthe dark for long periods\nregarding the possibility\nof reimbursement. Final\nyear PhD students, who\nalso suffered from a\nsimilar loss of time and\nproductivity, have been\nreimbursed with an extension of a month (or two,\ndepending on the circum-stances). One researcher\nexplained:\n\u201cYou have a fixed term\ncontract and that time is\nthe time you have to do\nwork so, if you lose a\nmonth of work\u2026 we\u2019re\nnot getting that back at the\nmoment unless the department decides to reimburse\nus for that lost time. The\nfunding agency employed\nus to work for that time.\nThere was a month where\nwe couldn\u2019t work because\nof the move and we were\ndoing other stuff, setting\nthings up, moving things,\ncataloguing etc. Arguably\na breach of contract.\nThat\u2019s not really fair to us\nor for our careers. It\u2019s not\ngreat to lose a month of\ntime where you could have\nbeen employed. So I think\nthey haven\u2019t done a lot to\neven address that. There\nshould be more of a policy\nin place because they\u2019ve\ndone it for final year PhD\nstudents, who\u2019ve got an\nextra extension of a month\nor two to cover that. So\nthey\u2019ve just not addressed\nthat with postdocs at all\nand it\u2019s as important for\nus as it is for them.\u201d\nWhen reflecting on\nProfessor Armstrong\u2019s\nstaff briefing, one member\nof staff commented, \u201cIt\u2019s\nPR isn\u2019t it? It doesn\u2019t\nreally have any basis\nin reality. It\u2019s whatever\nthey want to go out. Just\nlike any business.\u201d The\ngeneral sentiment of staff\nand students at White City\nhas been less than posi-tive, with one member of\nstaff describing the move\nto the campus as \u201cpoorly\nmanaged and a terrible\nexperience overall\u201d. They\nelaborated further, stating,\n\u201cWe (the students/staff\nmoving the labs) received\nvery little information in\nthe months prior to the\nmove and then were told\n4 weeks in advance our\nspecific moving dates.\nThis was coupled with\nfacilities not operational\nwhen we arrived, limitation on the hours that\nwe can actually do our\nwork. Deep impact on the\ncareer of the researchers,\nthe overall trajectory of\nthe groups. Incredible\nimpact on morale.\" This\nresearcher went on to\nbeg the question, \"Why\nthe hell did we have to\nmove at this particular\ntime, when the building\nwas not ready and they\nknew it was not ready?\nIt should have been left\nanother year until it was\nabsolutely spick and span.\nThen the move could have\ntaken in a much more\nefficient way.\"\nProfessor Armstrong\nhas acknowledged that\nthe building is still incomplete and provided some\nexplanation as to why the\nmove still went ahead:\n\"That\u2019s completely\ntrue, there are two floors\nbelow ground where no\nresearch groups have\nmoved in yet. Essentially\nthe whole building project\noverran. Originally, for\na long time, the building\nwas going to be handed\nover in February and then\nit switched to April. It\nkept edging forward and\neventually it was handed\nover in July and we had\nto make a decision, do\nwe start moving or not?\nAll the way through, what\nwe\u2019ve been trying to do is\nto minimise disruption to\nstudents, so we wanted to\nmove during the longest\nholiday period we could.\nSummer. So, even though\ntwo floors are not finished,\nwe decided to go ahead\nwith the move. That\u2019s\nabsolutely true, there are\ntwo floors that are not\nready but we\u2019ve done\nwhat we can to mitigate\ndisruption.\".\nThe building not being\ncompleted has lead to\nnumerous issues. One\nmember of staff com-plained:\n\"Drinking water taps\nand toilets go unrepaired\nand lifts are often out\nof service for weeks at\na time, as well as other\nmore major issues which\nWhen approached for\ncomment, Professor Alan\nArmsrong said the follow-ing:\n\u201cIt has been an incredi-blycomplicatedoperation.\nThat\u2019s the first thing to\nsay. We\u2019ve got everything\nranging from biology\nlabs, laser labs and, of\ncourse, chemicals, so the\nwhole process of moving\nstem from inadequate\ndesign of the lab facilities.\nIn light of this, the lack\nof presence of Estates\nfacilities or external contractors throughout much\nof the building is striking.\nThese problems faced by\nresearchers, staff and students alike, are invariably\ndescribed as \u2018temporary\u2019.\nWhilsttechnicallytrue,for\na department comprised\nprimarily of temporary\nworkers - be they under-graduates, postgraduates\nor postdocs - this is of little\nconsolation. Postdocs on\nshort-term contracts risk\nlosing out on grants and\nfurther positions if their\nresearch output drops; it\u2019s\nunclear if the significant\ndowntime caused by the\nmove constitutes a breach\nof contract in cases where\na postdoc is contracted\nto conduct research work\nonly. This situation is\nfar from an unqualified\nsuccess.\nThe staff and students\ngenerally recognised the\ninherent complexity of orchestrating such a move,\nacknowledging that \u201cin\na departmental move of\nthis scale, snagging is\nunavoidable, and a new\nbuilding is always going\nto have teething problems\u201d. However it was\nfelt that \u201cmismanagement\nof the move has cause\nhuge losses of time and\nresearch output, which\nwill disproportionately\naffect those whose time at\nthe College is limited\u201d.\nA further source of\ngrievance that has resulted from this loss of\ntime is the question of\nIn response to the complaints from post-doctoral\nresearchers in particular,\nProfessor Armstrong said\nthe following:\n\u201cAll the way through,\nwe were trying to minimise disruption but\nsomething this complex,\nit was always inevitable\nthere was going to be\nsome and I think the fact\nthat the handover was\ndelayed and the final\nfew weeks kept shuffling\nforward a week meant\nthere was uncertainty as\nto exactly when we were\ngoing to move right near\nthe end. We\u2019ve said that,\non a case-by-case basis,\nwe will make up for lost\ntime. We have paid an\nextension to their PhDs\nfor the downtime and\nwe dealt with those first\nbecause the end of their\nPhDs was September and\nthat was right in the move\nperiod. Often people get\na lot of their results at the\nend of their PhD, that\u2019s\nthe most productive time,\nwhen you\u2019re frantically\nusing the last time in the\nlab and that was the time\nthe move was at the peak\nso we made the decision to\nact on the final year PhD\nstudents straight away\nand we gave almost all of\nthem a bursary extension\nto cover the lost time.\nWe\u2019ll do the same for 2nd\nyears and 1st years when\nthe time comes. If they\u2019ve\nstill got a year and a half\nfunding left, we\u2019re not at\nthe stage yet where their\nmoney stops so we\u2019ll deal\nwith it on a rolling basis.\nOne researcher summarised the issues that have\nbeen experienced since\nthe move as follows:\n\"Building not being\ncomplete, disability\naccess not being clear,\n\u201cImportantly,\nI want to\nclarify that the\noccupation of\na new, more\nmodern,\nfacility is a\npositive thing\u201d\nAlthough largely neg-ative, the feedback from\nthis move was not all\ndoom and gloom. Some\npositive feedback was\nreceived regarding the\nlayout of the laboratory\nand study spaces. One\nPhD student said the fol-lowing:\n\"It cannot be overstated\nhow much the office\nworking environment for\nchemists has improved\nin the new building \u2013 for\nthe majority it is the first\ntime researchers have experienced bright and clean\noffice space.\"\nThis assessment was in\nkeeping with some of the\npositives included in Professor Armstrong's brief\nand, when asked what\nthe department's response\nto criticism would be,\nProfessor Armstrong said:\n\" What we could do for\nexample is, now people\nhave been there for a few\nweeks, we could put out\na survey that says let us\nknow what your thoughts\nare. We might pick up a\nload of little things that\nsometimes bother people\nbut they don\u2019t feel they\u2019re\nbig enough to talk to a\nmember of staff. I think\nit would be a really good\nidea, now that we\u2019re in\nthere and people have had\na month or 2, to say what\nis missing? The amount\nof people that have been\ninvolved in the project\nfrom Estates, safety, as\nwell as the researchers,\nit\u2019s actually pretty stunning that we\u2019ve got as\nmuch done as we have.\nBut I completely agree,\nthere was no way it was\ngoing to be perfect and\nthere are things that were\nnot perfect and we\u2019ll put\nthem right and we\u2019ll listen\nto whatever students have\nto say.\"\nThe White City campus\nvery much remains a work\nin progress.\n\u201cI think\nfundamentally\nwhat most of\nthe White City\ncampus really\nis, is a land\ngrab. Really,\nImperial\nCollege is\nnot a science\ninstitute, it's\na real estate\nbusiness\u201d\n\n"

Instead of\nwatching artificial content\nfrom celebrities that is\nirrelevant to the student\u2019s\nreality and moreover has\na negative effect on their\nwellbeing, students can\nconnect and create a peer\nsupport system, leading\nto a bright professional\nfuture.\u201d\n\u201cNetwork is designed\nin such way that allows\nstudents to become part\nof the whole community\nunlike traditional applications that only allow\nusers to start with a small\nnumber of connections\nand limit their reach at\nsome point. Content, connections and possibilities\nare moving with time\nand change,\u201d Veliaj said.\n\u201cEven though we have\nnow opened up to Imperial\nand Goldsmiths, Imperial\u2019s network will remain\nclosed. Students will only\nbe able to interact with\nother students and view\ncontent from their univer-sity, allowing them to feel\ncomfortable expressing\nthemselves.\u201d\nIt is exclusivity this that\nmakes Network special.\n\u201cKeeping it exclusive\nallows us to develop a\nproduct that students\nlove,\u201d Veliaj said. \u201cWe\nare not putting numbers\nbefore doing the right\nthing for the students that\nuse our service and this\nis a really good time to\ndo that because embedding that culture really\nearly in our business is\nextremely important. In\nthe end it really comes\ndown to values and we\nare focusing on keeping\nNetwork valuable for\nstudents.

Once\nthey complete the setup\nthey are automatically\nconnected with students\nin their class, in the same\ncourse, in the same department and from the same\ncountry. Students can also\nlook up other students that\nare looking for a place to\nrent or that are renting a\nplace out.\nTake charge of your university experience with Network! // Wikimedia\nTECH\nFRIDAY, 30TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\ntecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n12\n\u201cNetwork is\nrethinking\nthe university\nexperience\u201d\npart of a community, but\nthat community is not\nvisible to you right away.\nYou have to go out and\nfigure it yourself. In the\nmajority of cases, you find\nyourself missing out on\nmeeting people or doing\nthings that you are really\ninterested in because for\none reason or another\nyou are concentrating on\nthe wrong part. Network\nprovides students with the\ntools to view and better\nunderstand the community they are becoming part\nof as soon as they join\nImperial, and that instantly opens up a whole new\nset of possibilities.\u201d\n\u201cLooking\nat the big\npicture, there\nare so many\nproblems\nNetwork could\nsolve. One of\nthe problems\nit tackles is\ndating.\u201d\n\u201cWe are\ntrying to push\nstudents\naway from\nthe distorted\nreality of\ncompeting\nwith their\nfriends for\nlikes and\nattention\nand really\nhelping them\nbuild deeper\nrelationships.\u201d\n\u201cAccommodation is a\nhuge problem in London\nand we are thinking of\nnew ways to tackle this\nproblem,\u201d Veliaj said.\n\u201cIt is quite hard to find\nother students to share\na place with and we\nwant to change that. Not\nonly should students be\nable to easily find other\nstudents to share a place\nwith, but they should\nalso find students from\nthe same department or\nwith similar intentions.\nThat way students don\u2019t\nhave to live with people\nthey don\u2019t like, and that\nwould change the student\nsocial experience tre-mendously. As a student\nmyself I am aware of the\nuniversity regulations.\nWhen I stopped living in\nthe university accommodation halls I still had no\nother option than to pay\nfor the whole term since I\nwasn\u2019t able to find another\nstudent to take my place.\u201d\nLooking at the big\npicture there are so many\nproblems Network could\nsolve. One of the problems\nit tackles is dating. \u201cIf we\nthink about dating, it all\nstarts with two people\nintroducing themselves\nas friends. Once we give\nstudents the ability to get\nto know other students\nwith similar interests and\nintentions, it\u2019s up to them\nto decide if that someone\nshould be their date or\nnot, it\u2019s very simple and it\nhappens naturally, \u201d Veliaj\nsaid. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to\nbe this vulgar application\naimed only at dating.\u201d\n\u201cFundamentally we\nare trying to achieve two\nthings,\u201c Veliaj said. \u201cThe\nfirst one is encouraging\nstudents to do more activities together, either a\ngroup of students planning\nsomething together or one\nstudent joining an activity\norganised by someone\nelse. If someone is\npartying or playing tennis,\nother students should be\ngiven the chance to join\nthem.

For men, the life\nexpectancy was 74.0\nyears among the poorest,\ncompared to 83.8 years\namong the richest.\nThey also revealed that\nthe life expectancy of\nEngland\u2019s poorest women\nhas fallen by 0.24 years\nsince 2011, in what researchers say is a \u201cdeeply\nworrying\u201d trend.\nEqually shocking was\nthat the life expectancy\ngap between the most\naffluent and most deprived\nsectors of society has\nactually increased since\nthe turn of the century,\nfrom 6.1 years in 2001\nto 7.9 years in 2016 for\nwomen, and from 9.0 to\n9.7 years in men.\nThe team conducted\ntheir analysis by using\ninformation on where\neach death occurred,\nwhich was matched to\nsmall areas of England\nknown as lower super\noutput areas by the Office\nof National Statistics.\nThese lower super output\nareas, which each have\na population of around\n1,500 people, are given a\nscore of deprivation from\nthe Office of National\nStatistics (called an Index\nof Multiple Deprivation).\nThe research team point\nout this means the comparisons are based on a\ncommunity\u2019s deprivation\nand affluence, and not that\nof individuals.\nProfessor Majid Ezzati,\nsenior author of the\nresearch from Imperial\u2019s\nSchool of Public Health,\nsaid: \u201cFalling life expectancy in the poorest\ncommunities is a deeply\nworrying indicator of\nthe state of our nation\u2019s\nhealth, and shows that\nwe are leaving the most\nvulnerable out of the collective gain.\n\u201cWe currently have a\nperfect storm of factors\nthat can impact on health,\nand that are leading\nto poor people dying\nyounger. Working income\nhas stagnated and benefits\nhave been cut, forcing\nmany working families\nto use food banks. The\nprice of healthy foods like\nfresh fruit and vegetables\nhas increased relative\nto unhealthy, processed\nfood, putting them out of\nthe reach of the poorest.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe\nfunding squeeze for\nhealth and cuts to local\ngovernment services\nsince 2010 have also\nhad a significant impact\non the most deprived\ncommunities, leading to\ntreatable diseases such as\ncancer being diagnosed\ntoo late, or people dying\nsooner from conditions\nlike dementia.\u201d\nThe research team also\nanalysed the illnesses\nthat contributed to the\nwidening life expectancy\ngap. Although they found\nthat people in the poorest\nsectors died at a higher\nrate from all illnesses,\na number of diseases\nshowed a particularly\nstark difference between\nrich and poor.\nThe diseases that led\nto particularly large loss\nof longevity in the poor\ncompared to the rich\nwere newborn deaths\nand children\u2019s diseases,\nrespiratory diseases, heart\ndisease, lung and digestive\ncancers, and dementias. In\n2016, children under five\nyears old from the poorest\nsectors of society were\n2.5 times as likely to die\nas children from affluent\nfamilies.\n\u201cThis study suggests\nthe poor in England are\ndying from diseases that\ncan be prevented and\ntreated,\u201d said Professor\nEzzati. \u201cGreater investment in health and social\ncare in the most deprived\nareas will help reverse the\nworrying trends seen in\nour work. We also need\ngovernment and industry\naction to eradicate food\ninsecurity and make\nhealthy food choices\nmore affordable, so that\nthe quality of a family\u2019s\ndiet isn\u2019t dictated by their\nincome.\u201d\nA map of England\u2019s Indices of Multiple Deprivation, listing the most deprived areas (2010 DCLG data) // Guardian\nISSUE 1707\nFELIX\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\n\n"
