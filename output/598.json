    "content": "Dear Mark\nI would like to apologise to\nthe National Deal Children's Soeiety lorou r decision to\ncancel Year Rag Collection tomorrow. The Imperial College Union has received a complaint from the Police; that \" wc\"( I CRag) have not\nsubmitted our accounts lor last year, a legal requirement for the issue of new licenses.\nThis should have been done in March of this year. The letter from the Police also\npointed out that several students arc already subject to\nlegal action, both for not returning the accounts and lor collecting this year with no licence (not even the usual door to door one). It is most\nunusual lor action to be taken against students for minor infringements of Rag Collecting rules, however the Guilds Exec lee l that in view of this\nletter discretion is the better\npart of valour. The Police are\nannoyed by the discourtesy\n' \" we\" have shown by ignoring reminders that the accounts\nare overdue. Our Rag Chairman has assured me that these\nreminders have never been\nreceived, but this does not\nexplain why in his six months of oil icc he has not corresponded with the Police or\nmade any attempt to secure\nam collecting licence or had the accounts audited. I understand that the matter is\nnow in hand and hopefully Year Rag can be rearranged. I remain, sir, in disbelief of this state of affairs.\nAndrew Rush to nC&G President Dear Sir\nIam writing to explain why we do not have new House to\nHouse Collection Licenses this year and why we were not\ngranted a Street Collection Permit for Rag Week. The fault lies mainly with last year's Rag Chairman, Ian Hodgson, and partly with the\npresent Junior Treasurer Matt Smith and thus myself as Iam responsible for his\nactions or lack of the m.Mr Hodgson was suffering\nthe same lack of licenses as Iam at this stage last year and thus when the police granted him a permit for the Rag Procession as well as House to\nHouse Licenses for the rest of\nthe year from January he\nmust have been vcr v relieved.\nHowever, he received them on two conditions: firstly, that\na Ibrm with the details of the\nRag Procession collection be\nreturned to the police by the\nend of March, this he did not\ndo and when he \" resigned\" his post at about that time he\ninformed neither Matt Smith nor myself of his undertaking to do so; and secondly, that\ndetailed accounts of all our collections for that year be\nsent to the police by the end of\nJune. On this latter there are\nthree points: firstly, by the\nend ol June the exams have just finished and there has not\nbeen enough time to sort out\nthe accounts let alone send\nthem to the Rag Senior Treasurer and from there to\nthe College auditors, Mr Hodgson should have known this and informed the police\noi it but his need of licenses at\nthe time probably cancelled out all o th cr thoughts. Sec on d ly, he again failed to\nin form Matt Smith or myself of his undertakings, and I have been to Scotland Yard recently where I discovered that the reminders sent out by\nthe police were sent to Mr Hodgson. This may well explain why none of them were brought to my attention( is he trying to drag Rag down with him?). Finally, in the summer when the accounts should have been audited. Matt Smith said that he would do so for me, as well as obtaining the licenses as he was staying in College throughout the summer. Towards the end of\nthe holidays when I returned to College more, I questioned him as to whether the matter was in hand and whether he\nwas phoning the police every-day to hurry them into issuing\nlicenses, he said that it was\nand that he would. Last week\nI discovered that these accounts have not even been\naudited. I remain sir, responsible for\nthe non-act if> n of two complete morons. Bill Du rod ieI CRag Chairman1981/2 Dear Mark\nOn Thursday, November19, from 11:00am to 2 : 0 0 pm the J CR was booked by the\nCollege to host a convention of University Vice Chancellors. The closure was not advertised or announced before-hand, and the ii rst students\nknew of it was when they were\nconfronted by locked doors\nand signs announcing that the\nUnion Exec had authorised the booking. The Buttery was\nstill open but access could only be gained via the stairs\nadjacent to the S her field Lower Refectory. From the\nButtery, students sampling one end of Mr Mooney' s catering repertoire could see\nthrough locked doors the table cloths, napkins, glass-ware and hors d'oe uvres of his\npublic image as \" ali rst class\ncaterer\"( as Prince Philip might say).\nThe closure of the J CR without warning is annoying in itself, but for the STOIC members who worked until9:30 pm on Wednesday night\nfinishing the special Rag Week edition of' News Break'in time lor it to be shown to\nthe regular100 or so viewers\nin the J CR at lunchtime on Thursday, the closure was plain frustrating. As it was the\nprogramme had to be broad cast on Friday. Not only did the Exec not\nsee fit to in form me, as STOIC Chairman, that we\ncould not show our programme on Thursday, but\nJen in the Union Office knew nothing of any J CR booking, even as it took place.\nDo the Exec realise how much inconvenience is caused\nwhen the College is without a common room at lunchtime? And shouldn't they have to\nin form someone of their actions, especially when giving away student facilities?\nOr is keeping Captain Lindley and the College happy more important than the welfare of students?\nTours disgustedly\nLawrence Wind ley STOIC Chairman Dear Sir\nThe facilities in Imperial College Halls of Residence are deteriorating fast. The cooking facilities have reached a dangerous condition and there are many other d elects too numerous to mention. We arc told that expenditure on residence fabric has been frozen because Imperial College residence arc current ly running at a large de licit. However the latest that we hear that College authorities have capitulated to the whining and snivelling Hall Hall residents and is going to\naward them a rebate of twenty pounds each.\nA calculation on the back ol an envelope reveals that the\nrent they pay barely covers\nservicing the mortgage on the\npi ace.( Fry renting a cupboard in Knightsbridge for\nless than T2.5.) Ido not object\nto rent collected from othe r halls being used to help buy new Halls of Residence, but I strongly object to it being handed out to the residents of this extremely desirable Hall. When they moved into Hall Hall they were aware of the\namount of rent that they were\ngoing to pay and the fact that\nthe Hall was not finished and they entered into an agree-ment to pay the spec i lied rent.\nIf they do not like it now then\nthey should go elsewhere. Iam sure that plenty of other people could be found to live\nin it. I therefore demand that\nCollege authorities should demonstrate that they are not\ncompletely spineless and step\nin and veto this immediately. Additionally I consider it\nshortsighted and b latent popularity seeking of the FELIX Editor and Union President to support this unreasonable demand.} 'ours faithfully\nAndrew Lv all.

    "content": "The Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B. Based on the novel by J.P. Donleavy.\nStarring Simon Callow and Patrick\nRyecart. Directed by Ron Daniels. Duke\nof York's Theatre, St. Martin's Lane.\nThis immensely enjoyable play took me\ncompletely by surprise. The leaflet advertising\nthe play depicts two young men lying virtually\non top of a well-endowed young lady; all of\nthem are un clad. Under the somewhat suspicious title are the words: \"The world\npremiere of a bawdy and joyous new play \",\nand on the back of the leaflet are such quotes\nfrom critics as 'lush and lovely, bawdy and sad,\nrobust and warm delights'. I was tempted to\nbring along my dirty mac. However, it was just\nas well that I didn't because the play could\nhardly have been more different than I had\nanticipated.\nThe play is based on the novel of the same\nname by J.P. Donleavy, an ex-boxer who has\nbecome one of today's giants of contemporary\nliterature. As a writer, Donleavy sees himself\nas \"a kind of journalist\u2014going out and picking\nup stories\". Indeed, the novel was conceived in\na traffic jam in Knightsbridge!\nThe curtain rises on a student's room in\nTrinity College, Dublin, the room, in fact, of\nBalthazar, a reserved, handsome French prince played by Patrick Ryecart. The other\npr in ici pal personality in the play is Beefy, a most outrageous character; extrovert, upper-class, gentlemanly, stocky and loveable, a student of divinity and intellectually the most\nbrilliant student of the College, but who has an\ninsatiable appetite for carnal lust of a most\nunspeakable variety. This character is played\nmost convincingly by Simon Callow. The play\ncentres around the strong friendship that\ndevelope s between these two seemingly\nopposite personalities and the strength that\nV77I4\nFrom left: Simon Callow (Beefy), Charlotte West-Oram (Rebecca) and Noel Coleman (junior\nDean) in a scene from The Beastly Beattitudes of Balthazar B. each imparts to the other as they descend the\ndownward spiral of life.\nTrouble starts when Beefy brings two girls of\n'ill-repute' into Balthazar's room and indulges\nin a feast of sin, while Balthazar looks upon the\nproceedings with indifference. The Junior\nDean bursts in and has the two expelled.\nBalthazar, however, has not lost everything.\nBefore this unfortunate incident, Elizabeth\nFitzdare (played by Susan Gilmore) proposed\nto him. She seems to be too good to be true,\nbeautiful, Christian, full of poise and graceful\nlooks. The engagement is rudely shattered\nwhen the trustees of Balthazar will not agree to\nthe marriage. During his loneliness, he falls\ninto the traps of another girl and a subsequent\ndisastrous marriage. Balthazar cannot vanquish the thoughts of the beautiful Fitzdare, and when his wife leaves the house,\nhis thoughts turn to Alphonsine (played by\nLizzie Romilly) a more than attractive French\nau-pair. The scene that follows is one of the\nmost captivating I have ever beheld. In a most\nsensuous French accent Alph on sine tan-tal is ingly describes her boyfriend back home in\nsuperlative terms, leaving Balthazar feeling\ntotally inadequate but all the more desirous of\nAlph on sine. Lizzie Rom illy' s accent and\nmanner sims are a sheer pleasure to behold,\nand one that I shall never forget.\nAgain this backdrop of Balthazar' s misfortunes, Beefy' s excessive sexual indulgences cause him to become a disinherited outcast. The two manage to hold their\nheads above the sea of troubles by means of\ntheir mutual friendship.\nThis most endearing play is at once comic,\nthoughtful and touching. It is well worth a visit.\nThe Seven Deadly Sins (of Ordinary\nPeople) Ballet Chante by Kurt Weill. Text\nby Bertolt Brecht. Les Mamelles de\nTiresias (The Breasts of Tiresiast).\nOpera-Bonffe by Francis Poulenc. Text\nby Guillaume Apollincaire from his\noriginal play. Opera double-bill at the\nEnglish National Opera, St. Martin's Lane.\nKurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht collaborated\non the 'sung ballet'. The Seven Deadly Sins, in\n1933. The work is Weill's last before he\nemigrated to America and a 'second career'\ncomposing Broadway musical. Brecht revises\nthe traditional meanings of the seven sins\n(sloth, pride, anger, gluttony, lust, avarice and\nenvy) in the light of contemporary social\nvalues. Weill's score is exceptionally varied in\nstyle and features prom in ant ly the banjo and\nthe guitar. It is melodious and at times\nbeautiful and expresses a parody and criticism\nof hypocrisy. The end result is song and dance\ncombined to rare and appealing effect.\nAnna leaves home in tbe Mid-West of the\nUS to make her, and her family's, fortune.\nHer nature, as with the rest of us, is two-fold:\npractical Anna and idealist Anna. The two\naspects of her nature assume two persons in\nthe opera. Practical Anna, played by Jenny\nWeston, goes into show business as a dancer\nand strives to make her way to the top in the\nsearch of fortune and recognition. Idealist\nAnna, played by Marti Webb (alias Eva Per6n\nin Evita), looms over the practical Anna as she\ndances her way through the following scenes.\nWhich of Anna's two aspects are the more\nimportant for making her way up in the world?\nThe seven deadly sins are committed by Anna\nas she succeeds in reaching the top of her\nprofession and by her family back home, who\nbegin to live off her riches. However, at the top\nof her career, Anna is still unhappy. She\nreturns home, rich and successful but grown\nup and responsible, apparently all the more\nwise after her experiences. In the end, the\nidealist Anna appears to triumph and the\npractical Anna appears to have been broken,\nbut the former confides to the latter: \" You can\nstill be a hero, but it won't achieve anything.\nThe heroes-those who stand up for moral\nprinciples and rights\u2014have only death to look\nforward to.\" Each sin has been made out to be\nthe reverse of what one might expect and the\nterrifying message of Anna's family is that you\nonly get on at all if you don't give in to the\ntemptation of standing up for what you believe.\nThe work is only forty minutes long but is\nsuperbly finished and executed. The designs\nare simple but very effective. My only criticism\nis that the structure of the work is a little\nsimplistic and lacks a smooth flow. It is rather\nlike a medieval tapestry of four scenes depicting the four virtues.\nNo doubt you have seen a surrealist painting, can see an example of surrealist\ntheatre in the_ form of Les Mamelles de\nTiresias. The opera is based on the play by\nGuillaume Apallimaire. It was he who, in an\nintroductory note written for the play's premiere in 1917, invented the word surrealism, thus giving a name to a new\nmovement in art and literature. He wrote \"to\nmake, if not a new movement in the theatre, at\nleast a personal statement, I thought it\nnecessary to return to nature itself, without\nimitating it like a photograph. When Man\nwanted to imitate walking, and created the\nwheel\u2014which does not look like a leg\u2014he\ncreated surrealism without knowing it \"\nComposed by Poulenc in 1948, the opera is\na comedy of modern day morality. It presents\na hilarious and satirical view of feminism, sex-changes, male chauvinism and the problems of\nsingle parent families where the father gives\nbirth to babies! Marilyn Hill Smith plays the,\npart of the 'mother' and Emile Beicourt plays\nthat of the 'father'. As is to be expected from\nsurrealist art the plot, and especially the stage\ndesigns, are highly bizarre and amusing. In\nfact, it is very difficult to know how much of\nthe work, if any, is meant to be taken seriously;\none is forever trying to discern the intentions\nof the author. However, the opera is most\nunusual and entertaining, if a little baffling.\nNick Bedding\nFELIX, November 27, 1981 Page 9\n\n"

We hope to\nrepeat our success in the remaining three\nmatches.\nSnooker\nOnly one match last week, this featuring the\namazing B team who continued on their merry\nway by beating LSE' B'41. It would have been\n5-0 if Andy \"Don't break my beer glass\" Wright\nhadn't come up against a pretty useful player\nwho was miles better than anything their A team had the previous week.\nAway from the league scene, there will be a number of competitions starting soon, the first\nof these being the PotLuck Doubles on Sunday, December 6. Look out for the notice\nin the snooker room. Also, the first rounds of\nthe Billiards Open and Handicap Tournaments\nwill be starting soon, so come along and sign\nup for those as well. All these competitions are\nopen to any member of the club.\nPS: Look out for small ad detailing FREE membership for the 300th person to join.\nPPS: We are arranging trips to Wembley\nand Sheffield for major tournaments in the new\nyear, come and sign up as soon as possible.\nDebating\nIf you think it pretty disgraceful that IC is\nwithout a Debating Society, then you are not\nalone. If you are interested in starting/joining a new one, come along to Huxley 140 at 1:00pm on Thursday, December 8.\nExperience is not essential. The impertinence to expound from alec turn a view with\nwhich you may in fact disagree is all that is\nrequired! Since a good turnout on Thursday is\nessential if a Debating Society is to be started,\nbe brave and turn up.\nIndustrial\nWe still have a few places left on the Tube\nInvestments Business Game, which simulates\na manufacturing process from raw materials to\nmarketing. This takes place in the afternoon of\nWednesday, November 2 in College and will\nbe most humorous and interesting. Contact\nAlistair Kirk, Physics 2 for details.\nMonday, November 30 Trip to Mars, and\nWednesday, December9,\" Simply Years Ahead\" invasion of the Philips labs, Redhill,\nboth meet at Beit Arch12:50 for 1:00pm kickoff.\nAdvance warning \u2014 we have a general meeting on December 10, so read next week's FELIX for the gen.\nBLOOD DONING\nTues 8 and Wed 9 December\nUnion Dining Hall\n10:00am12:00 and 2:00 4:00pm Your blood is needed.\nWhere amI? Imperial College. What do you\nwant? Information. So you read SF Soc Bulletins already? You won't learn anything\nhere mate! By hook or by crook, we will.- Who\nis Publicity Officer of the SF Soc? That would\nbe telling. Who are you? Iam the new author\nof SF Soc Bulletins. Well who wrote last\nweek's then? You are a student.\nBut you knew that already, didn't you? If you\ncame to the \"Superheroes What's My Line\"\nyou might know more, even if you know damn\nall about the books of Harry Harrison. As far\nas 2001 goes 1 still think its a great film, even\nwith rotten sound and focus. The rotten sound\nwas explained in a previous bulletin. As for the\nfocus 1 received a very moving monologue\nfrom an Ents person on the difficulties of\nfocussing an anam orphic lens attachment and\nhave nothing but sympathy for him. Anyway,\n\"Bedazzled\" is not in scope, so no worries\nthere. No real news, everything's pending, i.e. what's confirmed you already know, and nothing further is known on what you don't. Did that make sense? Well I think so. Mark\nSmith 's Editorial Policy dictates that I stop\nhere. So long stuff fans.\nScout & Guide\nThe Scout and Guide weekend to Brecon\nseemed confined to hikes in Hyde Park on\nFriday afternoon, when it was discovered that\nthe College minibus didn't work. However,\nKate Malcolm and Austin were kind enough to\nlend their cars, and so after piling in all\nfourteen of us, and gear, we drove off in to the\nwest\nBase camp was the first Brecon scout hut,\nfrom which we set off the next morning. Half of\nthe group did a ridge walk over Pen y fan\nwhich was interesting as the wind was high and\nthe cloud base low, although we had a terrific\nview of the countryside on the way down. The\nother group went down White Lady cave,\nwhich even had a rabbit guarding the entrance.\nAfter cooking supper, there was a trip to the\nlocal hostelry, followed by rope technique\ndemonstrations back at the hut. Even 6\" off\nthe ground it looked a trifle desperate\nOn Sunday the caving contingent, clearly\nenjoying the luxury of having wetsuits, swam\nthrough parts of port h yr-og of cave and splashed around in pools outside. The walkers\nwent up onto the Beacons again and practised\nwalking 'off plumb' in high winds on Craig y fan. We had another impressive view of clouds\nmoving up the valley as we walked down the\nreservoir.\nStew and dumplings for supper squashed\ndown nicely during the trip back to London\nafter a most enjoyable weekend.\nH.G. Wells\nWellsoc will recommence its lecture prog ram me this Monday with Heinz Wolffe\naddressing the society on Medical Engineering.\nThe average age of our society( not Wellsoc!) is steadily increasing due to the\nsharp drop in the birth rate with the advent of\nbetter and more readily available contraception in the past few decades. This brings\never increasing demands on our medical\nservices lo cater for our aging population.\nHeinz Wolffe will be lecturing on the\nadvances in medical eri'ji rie ring in our society.\nDr Wolffe's oratory is surpassed only by his\nability to generate excitement and interest in\nwhatever subject he is speaking on. This\npromises to be one of Wellsoc's finest lectures,\nso don't miss it! Monday, Mech Eng 220, 7:30.\nConsoc\nThe speaker meeting with William Whitelaw\nwas well attended and the Home Secretary\nspoke on various topics including Ireland and\nthe recent race riots. IT is very rare that\nImperial College has guest speakers of this\ncalibre. Fortunately the Conservative Society\nhave Sir Keith Joseph, Minister for Education,\ncoming next term and various other speakers\nthroughout the year.\nOn December 3 Barney Heyhoe, MP will be\nspeaking in Huxley 340 at 1:00pm.

So for five\nyears (at least) you have not\nonly been offending those students who do not eat beef\nbut swindling the other students.\nI personally think that this\ndisgraceful and also utterly reprehensible of you to try to\nbrazen it out by saying\" the error has arisen because we have changed suppliers\" and that\" the staff themselves were unaware of the contents\".

    "content": "What's On\nLast Week\nI have received a lengthy but anonymous\ndiscourse on the errors in last week's FELIX.\nWhen I awoke, bleary-eyed on Friday after a long week plagued by a mechanical error, I realised that I had really rushed through in\norder to maintain a Friday publication deadline. The William Whitelaw story was\nappalling, mainly because I was let down by my\noriginal reporter at a vulnerable time, and did\nnot have the time or energy to personally rearrange and improve it.\nIf I for one moment believed that everybody\nwas as critical as my correspondent, I would\nnot have produced an issue at all\u2014but I think\nmaintaining a regular publication is very\nimportant and is appreciated by many people.\nThe most disappointing thing for me and my\nstaff is that the result of one of our hardest\nweeks work (i.e. that issue) could never truly\nrepresent the time involved (many \"good\"\nissues have been produced with less effort). I am not superhuman and can only stand two or\nthree fourteen hour days a week.\nUnlike the other sabbaticals, I am judged by\nthe whole of College EVERY FRIDAY. If an\nissue is late or poorly presented for any reason, if someone's letter or article does not\nappear, if I make any errors of fact or\njudgement then people complain. Praise is a much appreciated rarity. And I must rely on\nvolunteers to be able to function at all.\nA rather well-known puzzle generally called\nthe eight queens problem invites you to place\neight queens on a chessboard in such a way\nthat no two of them share a row, column, or\ndiagonal. (This includes all the diagonals, of\ncourse, not just the two long ones.) The\ndiagram shows a correct solution under the\nterms normally imposed.\nBut you will notice that the queens on the\nfirst three rows of my solution, although they\ndo not lie on any row, column or diagonal of\nthe chessboard, are nevertheless in an exact\nstraight line. What 1 am looking for this week is\na valid solution to the eight queens puzzle with\nthe added restriction that no three queens lie\nin a straight line.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office please. A prize of \u00a35 (donated by\nMenda-Bike) for the correct solution\nrandomly selected at 1:00pm on Wednesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nAs expected, some of you found it trivial, and\nsome found it impossible. In fact the answers\nto the first paper are simply the notes of 'God\nSave the Queen' and the answers to the\nsecond paper are the notes of 'The Star\nSpangled Banner' (both in C major). Apologies\nto anyone who was badly fooled; I promise not\nto set puzzles this cheeky very often.\nSo I must battle on, think up new ideas,\ncoax people into helping me and yet bear\nuninformed criticisms from someone who is\ntoo lazy and unconcerned to come in and help\nor even find out how and why such errors\noccur. Is it surprising that I therefore start to\nfeel bitter and will not print one unhelpful\nindividual's opinions?\nThe lack of appreciation and interest in\nhelping really make me feel that I am casting\npearl before swine. But as one who has been\nelected (and is paid) to form the habit of\nmaking a silk purse from a sow's ear, I suppose\nI should at least be prepared to go the whole\nhog.\nStatistic\nWhile four thousand people read FELIX\nregularly, fewer than ten students are actually\nconcerned enough to put in a substantial\namount of effort to produce it. Talented and\ndedicated people are needed who can\nregularly devote some spare time to improving\nand expanding the content. This doesn't mean\nmore boring clubs and society articles or\ntediously long letters, but entertaining and\ninteresting features and better news coverage.\nOriginal ideas will be welcomed, but must be\napproved by the Editor (before you start\nproducing reams and reams of unwanted\nmaterial!). It you wish to contribute or learn\nmore about FELIX, then come to the staff\nmeeting today (Friday) at 12:30pm in the\nFELIX Office. It's never too late to join us.\nCredits\nJoy! Joy! Joy!

    "content": "Letters!\nDear Mark\nPerhaps by admitting the error of my ways I can shed\nsome light on your heap of\ncontradictory mail last week.\nBefore Council allowed the sale of the Rag Mag to IC students only I was given a' review copy'\" by Barney McCabe, IC Deputy Pre si dent. This was lor me to look\nat and show to other people in an attempt to gauge opinion to a potentially controversial issue.\nLiving in a Chaplaincy House, I realised that there\nmight be some members of the Chaplaincy who would be\noffended by the Rag Mag, and so I arranged for my copy to be passed on to David Ash forthwith a request to\nmake it available for people to\nview so if a motion was put to\na UC Mallow them to vote\nfrom a position of knowledge having had a chance to make their own minds up.. If as Steve Readings suggests the letters were sent\nprior to the Council motion it\nmakes matters worse not better as the Rag Mag was not on sale at all. This deliberate abuse of the\npriv leg ed position I put David Ash forth in is inexcusable. I would also question if my original request was carried out or if in fact Chaplaincy members voting to ban the Rag Mag were doing so on the basis of the opinion of some self appointed moral guardians of IC. Finally I would like to apologise to Barney for him being directly implicated and for my misjudgement of the\nChaplaincy heir a eh y.I also\nhope that if this issue is raised\nagain at aUG M people will vote in lull awareness of the\nfacts and in accordance with their conscience or abstain. l ours faithfully\nXi c kW atm ough Dear Sir\nMost people know that Barclays Bank is the largest\nbank in South Africa, ser-vicing every aspect of the apartheid system. Is it not for\nthis reason that Barclays are prohibited from having branches on College premises?\nHowever, the other three\nmajor banks ( Nat West, Lloyds and Midland) are not guilt less. Nat West, for example, made a loan of S25m to the South African Government in June1979 and has made other loans through a Swiss\nsubsidiary.\nThere are alternatives to\nthe Big F 'our, namely the Co op, TSB and Giro. Would it not be possible for\nthis situation to be remedied? Replacing theN at West branch in College, with one of the previously mentioned alternatives, would be more than just a futile gesture, because clearing banks are not immune to public opinion. This strategy has already achieved limited success in making Barclays less popular. While we wait for this to\nhappen, individuals can make their feelings known by closing their accounts with any of the four major banks,\nand changing to one of the alternatives.\nIwa it in anticipation. Tours sincerely\nGraeme Shaw Anti Apartheid Group Dear Mark\nI would like to make a few\npoints in an attempt to balance the rather one-sided\ndebate about the Rag Mag.No body has yet pointed out that one of the reasons the mag was banned was because\nPat Coll, the Rag Mag Editor, is no longer at College and therefore couldn't defend\nhis publication. I lind it ironic that the God Squad should put its\nweight behind the censorship\nbrigade. Despite considerable pressure from his friends, Pat refused to include certain jokes which might have offended the religious minor i ties in College. If I had had my way the Jesus freaks really would have had something to complain about. What sickens me most is\nthat nobody in College had the decency to send the Rag Mag Editor a copy of his own publication. Whilst not expecting such Christian virtues to emanate from the Holy Alleluia bigots, I would have expected the FELIX Editor to have been a little\nmore charitable. Nick Cox j Rag Mag Contributor Dear Sir\nI have just read the cover of your so-called \" newspaper\" and Iam totally disgusted\nand demand an immediate apology for your severe and deplorable insult of the Rt Honourable R evIan Paisley,\nMP. I have just used his proper, deserved and respected title and hope you will do so in future. However I feel\nthat your\" error\"( Iam being kind) was not a mere mistake, but part of ICU's continuing policy of undermining the states of Loyal Protestant Ulster men. Take for example the banning the Rag Mag because it contained a few H Block jokes, however, much more, serious matters, such as\nthe slandering of our glorious\nleader passed without comment, and what about all the Gerry O' Reilly republican propaganda you printed last\nyear.\nTours in disgust\nWilliam King No Surrender. Ed's Note:\nIs this guy for real? MrI an Paisley purchased his divinity from a mail order university in the deep south of America( or so I'm told).

During\nthe long and sometimes arduous meeting the Deputy\nPresident, Barney McCabe was censured, and it was\nrevealed that a \u00a31.50 rent rise for all College residence\n(except Head Tenancies) is likely next term.\nThe President's Report was dealt with first. There was much discussion on the refectories, the joint IC/Q EC working party, bars, and residence. Whilst dealing with residence, Mr Morton shocked members of Council by announcing that there would probably be a \u00a31.50 rent rise next term. He thought that the\nUnion would have to accept this despite policy against mid session increases.\nThe Deputy President's report was taken next. Mr McCabe' s report was written in a flippant, sarcastic tone, as he reported\nwhat he had been doing since last Council. He had been\n\" having a great time\"\" giving people disinfectant for cleaning up puke...\"\" had three more free fresher s' dinners\". He also\nreported many things he hadn't done. Chris Webb( ManS ciDe pRep) referred the report back and moved a motion of\ncensure. On a paper ballot the motion was passed by 15 votes to\n7, with4 abstentions.\nThen, after ploughing through many sets of Union committee minutes, Council discussed the Rag Chairman' s failure to oba in collection licences this year, making Rag collecting illegal. A motion of censure on Bill D uro die( Rag Chairman) was proposed and passed without opposition.\nAfter finally approving the Constitution of the new\nEntertainments Committee, the meeting closed at 9:30pm.

Although the conference\nwas held in the Great Hall, the numbers attending necessitated the use of the Union run J CR for catering.\nThis was arranged between\nCaptain Lindley and Nick Morton with committee rooms 327, 328 and329 being\navailable for students until\n14:30.\nApart from\nrevenue (the\nthe J CR free\npens several considerable inconvenience was caused to students and the STOIC' viewing point in\nthe J CR was made un avail able without STOIC' being informed. a small loss ol\nUnion loaned\nand this hap tim csa vc aU RAG STUNTED!\nPresident Fears Fine\nUnion President, Nick Morton, took the decision on\nMonday to stop all further Rag collections because the\nUnion would have faced the possibility of prosecution if\nthey had continued.\nThe difficulties Rag is encountering this year stem from failure\nto present accounts for last year's collection licence and a complaint from the Multiple Sclerosis Society that IC Raghad been collecting without a licence in Oxford Street on a day which had been allocated to them. London Student reporter\nKaren March bank, who was investigating the story, rang Nick after Scotland Yard told her \" If there is sufficient evidence, it is\nquite likely we will prosecute\".

Tedium and procedural wrangling were\nthe order of the day as UL U's constitutional megalith broke\nthe l our hour barrier lor the\nfu st time. The ordeal began at 6:30\nwith the election of the student senators lor law and lot theology, economics and political science. This was so\nboring that one of the can di dates had n't even bothered to\nturn up. The meeting proper opened al7:40 pm. Almost immediately a delegate from\nKings College proposed that\nthe GU C' should hear two\nspeakers from the Polytechnic of Central London, who are\nholding an occupation at the\nmoment. This was passed and two extremely1 e11wing speakers were unleashed on the unsuspecting delegates.\nThe li rst speaker described how students invoked in the\noccupation attacked the police. After some a cro moni us debate about nothing much( it livened the meeting though!) the meeting went on to hear reports. These were as\nusual rather boring( although incredibly important). When the me eling came to\nmotions another procedural motion was passed allowing an emergency motion on occupations and other forms\nof militant action to be heard first.\nHowever, doubts were raised as to the legitimacy of\nthe proposal( by the aforementioned Kings delegate)\nand after a mere three hand votes (all inconclusive) and a tied card vote, the Chairman used his casting vote to refer\nthe motion to the next meet-ing. The disgruntled Kings delegate left the meeting, muttering under his breath. The meeting then sailed\nthrough the rest of the business\nrelatively easily. Three motions were passed which related to medical schools.\nThen a general motion on grants was passed after yet\nmore procedural wrangling. At this point the IC delegation began to get restless since it\nwas gone 1 0 : 0 0 pm and they\nhad hoped to return to IC in\nt me for the end of the RCS Centenary Bar night. Alas, even a challenge to the quorum and a move to close the\nmeeting were unsuccessful, and our heroes were forced to\nmiss out on the RCS piss-up,\nmaking do instead with lager\nat 30]) a pint from the UL U Bar(a special promotion). Two more motions were heard, the li rst a particularly silly one about unemployment was referred to the next meeting. The second, on NHS charges for overseas visitors,\nwas passed.

(Photo: Jane Williams/\nRCSithe first hundred years\nThe extraordinary history of the Royal College of Science was\nthe subject of an informative and entertaining talk given by\nProfessor G.J. Whit row to a capacity audience in Chemistry Lecture Theatre Bon Tuesday. Starting with the 1871 Royal Commission chaired by the\nDuke of Devonshire, he gave a detailed account of personalities\nand achievement up to 1953.\nThe early years were dominated by Geology and Biology and Prof Whit row reflected this balance in his lecture citing T.H. Huxley as the driving force behind the College, a man of\nprogressive ideas and fighting spirit as evidenced by his nickname' Darwin' s Bulldog'. Some interesting parallels can be drawn. between then and now. For instance, when Huxley first moved into the new buildings in South Kensington he said they ol fe red\" inefficient heating and a lack of fittings\" (rather similar to Montpelier St.).\nThe Biology Professors seemed to have been a most interesting set of people; one retired in the 1890s on a pension of\n\u00a31,500, about today's student grant, another died in the lab working with hydrogen cyanide, while H.H. Read edited The\nPhoenix and greatly confused the Editor\" of his local newspaper by alternately writing conservative and socialist letters under different names.\nChemistry Professors were not treated in the same detail but\nperhaps present-day dons could pay some attention to the\nimmaculate dress of aPr of Forster.\nBoys Oh Boys\nThe Physics Department has had along list of successes including the discovery of Helium by Prof Lockyer and Prof G.P. Thompson' s NobelPrize in 1937.\nHowever, the most interesting character from the Physics\ndepartment was C.V. Boys, a hopeless lecturer and experimental genius who apart from losing his wife to Pro l Forsythe( Maths) developed the Cavendish method for determination of the universal gravitation constant and who also used a crossbow to make quart/ fibres.\nIndeed, it could be said he was responsible ,e\\ en to blame) for\nthe awful S. Ken tunnel as he vigorously opposed any underground electrical transport in the vicinity of the College. Shortage of time only allowed Prof Whit row a brief history of\nthe Maths department before Prof Blow, Dean of RCS, proposed a vote of thanks.\nAfter the lecture Mrs Jeanne Ping ree. IC Archivist, who had earlier introduced Prof Whitlow, was presented with a bottle ol\npink champagne In R CSU, for her tremendous contribution to\nthe Centenary events.\nFEUX, November 27, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

Future topics may concern\nwhat effects the government cuts are having\non the various departments within College and\nhow departments will be reorganised if the\nmerger with QE C that is being discussed, is\ncarried out. The time taken up is not\nexcessive; the committee only meets two or\nthree times a term and the post of secretary\ninvolves only a little extra work in the writing of\nminutes and posting of notifications for\nmeetings.\nIf you wish to stand for one of these\nvacancies you can put your name up on the\npapers in the Lower Lounge in the Union\nBuilding together with the signatures of the\nrequisite number of second ers.

    "content": "SB & Rent rebates\nfor Christmas\nIf you have to pay rent during the\nvacation now is the time to start looking at the alternative ways of meeting\nthis extra expense, which is not accounted for in the student grant, nor\nconsidered by the local education\n.authorities as eligible for a discretionary vacation hardship grant,\nexcept in very unusual c irc um stances. The fact is that LEAs have\nre li qui shed their responsibilities in\nthis direction to other agencies that\nprovide financial assistance. Of\nthese the Department of Health and\nSocial Security (DHSS) gives the\nmost straightforward, and usually\nthe most substantial payments in the\nform of Supplementary Benefit and\nUnemployment Benefit. Local authorities operate the rent allowance and rate rebate schemes,\nwhich tend to be subject to local\nvariations, but more of these later.\nSupplementary Benefit is available for people with a low income\nwhose financial commitments leave\nthem with an insufficient amount for\ntheir everyday needs. For students\nthis would apply during the vacation,\nwhen they are available for work. As\nfar as a student on a normal grant is\nconcerned the income in the\nvacation is assessed at \u00a321.15pw. This more or less equals the basic\nliving allowance of SB, so the two\ntend to cancel each other out.\nHowever, if you apply at the Office\nfor the area where you are paying\nrent the additional expense of rent\nwill be met in part, or in total,\ndepending on your circumstances.\nHow SB is worked out If heating is\nincluded in your rent, \u00a35.10 will be\ndeducted from the amount eligible\nfor benefit, since this sum is included\nin the basic SB Allowance already\nbalanced off by your grant. Also,\nif your rent seems higher than\naverage the calculations may be\nbased on a rent more in line with\nsimilar accommodation that has\nbeen 'fair-rented'. Apart from this\nthe DHS S also sets a limit on the\nmaximum rent reimbursed which\nvaries in different areas. In the\nKensington/Fulham boroughs it is\n\u00a325 for single householders, \u00a320 for\nshare rs, \u00a326 for a flat let and \u00a331 for a one-bedroomed flat.\nAs far as basic living allowances\npayable are concerned these are\nbased upon your status, as determined by the DHS S, within a household. The term householder\nimplies someone who is individually\nresponsible for all household expenses. However, it is not\nprecisely defined, so even if you are\nrunning a separate household (own\nroom, own meters, etc.) a local\noffice may wrongly try to pay you at\nthe lower non-householder rate. The\nway that SB is worked out for\nshare rs, or joint-householders, is to\nclassify them as non-householders\nwith a special addition equal to their\nshare of the difference between the\nhouseholder and the non-house-holder scale rates. The current rates\n1981/2 are: Householder's allowance\n\u00a323.25; Non-householder's allowance \u00a318.60; Sharer's allowance\n\u00a318.60 + (\u00a34.65 divided by number of\nshare rs). As an example take a flat of four\nshare rs paying \u00a315 each. The basic\nliving expenses for one person will\nbe: \u00a318.60 + 1.11 = \u00a319.71 + rent at\n\u00a315 = \u00a334.71.\nFrom this sum \u00a321.15 (vacation\ngrant) is deducted, leaving \u00a313.56\npayable as Supplementary Benefit.\nHow to apply for SB1. Register as available for work on\nthe first weekday of the vacation at\nyour nearest Job Centre in the same\narea as the one in which you are\npaying rent. This benefit cannot be\nback-dated nor can it be applied for\nearlier than the first day that you are\nofficially available for work.\n2. Assuming that there is no suitable\njob available ask to be registered as\nunemployed. You will be given a card and form Bl.3. The card is taken to the unemployment benefit office (often in the\nsame building as the Job Centre)\nwhere you will receive instructions\nabout signing on regularly. This has\nbeen relaxed considerably because\nof the increasing numbers of\nunemployed.\n4. Form Bl is taken to the Supplementary Benefit Office. An appointment system is normally in opera-tion, so it may save time if you phone\nthem first. It will also save time if you\nhave the necessary documents with\nyou when you go to the SB Office to\nbe assessed. These are as follows: a rent book/tenancy agreement/letter\nfrom landlord or the Student Services Office, if you are in College\naccommodation, including proof\nthat you are resident at the address\nstated, a recent bank statement, and\na students' union card or other proof\nof identity, together with evidence of\nany savings you may have.\nThe calculations of your SB will be\nsent to you and if you disagree with\nthe assessment you are entitled to\nappeal within twenty-one days.\nAnd don't forget that anyone\nreceiving SB can automatically get\nfree NHS dental treatment, glasses\nand prescriptions. So if you think\nyou might be needing any of them\nask for an exemption certificate\nwhile you're at the DHS S Office.\nUnemployment Benefit is avail-able, during the vacations, for any\nstudent who has paid Class1 National Insurance contributions on\nearnings of at least \u00a3875 between\nApril 1978 and April 1979 or \u00a3976\nbetween April 1979 and April 1980.\nThis will give a flat rate of \u00a322.50\nwithout any other complications. If\nyou have earn t more than the above\nthe earnings related supplement will\napply to all claims made before\nJanuary 3, 1982. After this date the\nsupplement is to be discontinued.\nTo claim go to your local Unemployment Benefit Office on the first\nday of the vacation. Any earlier than\nthis they will turn you away, any\nlater and you will lose money since\npayment cannot normally be back\ndated. Take your P45 with you or a note of your national insurance\nnumber.\nRent Allowances and Rate\nRebates\nAs far as the world at large is\nconcerned, these are available for\nanyone living on a low income who is\npaying rent and has not signed a 'holiday' or 'company' let type of\nagreement with their landlord. As far\nas students in College residences\nare concerned there still exists\nconsiderable confusion and inconsistency as a result of the 1980\nHousing Act which appears to allow\nanyone in hostel-type accommodation to claim rent rebates; a situation which did not exist before\nthis Act and which has caused some\nlocal boroughs to over-react against\nstudent applications. While Kensington and Chelsea are processing as\nnormal and will also consider claims\nfrom students in College Halls who\ncan show that they live there\nthroughout the year, Westminster\nwill not deal with students who live in\nany type of accommodation rented\nthrough the College. We are hoping\nto effect a more liberal attitude from\nWestminster, but this may take time\nand will be aided by the accumulation of evidence from other boroughs\non their procedures. To this end we\nwill be sending out questionnaires to\nthe head tenancies on the results of\napplications for rebates and would\nalso appreciate information from\nanyone in private sector accommodation who has applied.\nTo return to basics; what are\nthese rebates and are they worth\napplying for anyway? Well, they do\nnot normally offset so much of the\nrent as SB, but their advantages are\nthat they can be paid while you are\naway from your accommodation, in\nsome cases during term time and\nthey do not entail all the hassle of\n'signing on'.\nHow Rent and Rate Rebates are\nworked out\nAs with SB the rent is firstly equated\nwith similar accommodation which\nhas been fair-rented. Then a25% deduction is usually made for\nfurniture, with a further amount\ndeducted (up to 25%) if heating is\nincluded in the rent. The rate\nelement ( approx25%) is also\nremoved, but this will be subject to\nits own rebate. The basic rebate will\nbe between 20% and 30% of the\nremaining figure. The percentage\nvaries according to the rent payable,\nshrinking as the rent increases.\nHowever, if your income is less than\n\u00a337.35 (the single person's housing\nbenefit needs allowance), as it\nnormally will during the vacation,\nthen 25% of the difference between\nthe income and the needs allowance\nyour income is more than the needs\nallowance then the basic rate is\nreduced by 17% of the difference\nbetween the income and the needs\nallowance.\nDuring the term time \u00a310.85 is\ntaken from both your weekly\nmaintenance allowance of \u00a338.54\nand your rent before the above\ncalculations are made.\nIf a rate rebate can be applied for\nit is not subject to any initial\nreductions, but the calculations tend\nto be even more tortuous without\nproviding a very clear indication of\nthe lin al outcome. The rent officers\nstress that each application for rent\nand rate rebates is unique and subject\nto its own variations, which makes it\ndifficult to give an average example.\nHopefully the results of our ques\ntion n aire will eventually enable us to\ngive more definite expectations.\nAll students in the head tenancies\nwill have rates included in their rent.\nThis should be clearly indicated on\nthe application form, even though\nyou will not normally know the\namount. The rent officer will work\nthis part out from the other information given. College Hall rents\ndo not include rates since this is paid\nby the UGC. Most other forms of\ntenancy will include rates unless\nthey are specifically excluded. While\nmany students will not qualify for\nrent allowances during term time it is\npossible that a rate rebate may apply\nsince this part of the rent is not\nsubject to the same reductions.\nHow to apply for Rent and Rate\nRebates\nThis can be done at any time. The\nearlier the better, since Kensington\nhas a two month processing delay as\na result of the recent supplementary\nrate.\nSome Town Halls or Council\nOffices will send you a form if you\nphone them, others will prefer you\nto collect and some are even\ndistributing them throughout the\ndistrict. They will be listed in the\nphone book under the name of your\nBorough. Those nearest IC are\nnoted below. You will also need to\nproduce the same documents as\ndescribed for Supplementary Benefit.\nIf you run into a problem when\nclaiming any of these benefits let us\nknow since we may be able to help\nand we appreciate any information\nthat can usefully be passed on to\nothers.\nNearest Officers for College Head Tenancies, Halls and Houses\nJob Centre and Unemployment\nOffice: 200 Shepherds Bush Rd, W6\n(603-3456).\nSupplementary Benefit Office:\nCharles House, 375 High St Kensington, W14 (603-4633).\nTown Hall: Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, 5 Nigel Playfair\nAve (off King St), W6 (748-3020).\nHamlet Gardens\nGerrard Mansions\nJob' Centre and Unemployment\nBenefit Office: Chadwick St, SW1\n(222-8060).\nSupplementary Benefit Office:\nRegency St, SW1 (834-8433).\nTown Hall: Westminster Council\nHouse, Marylebone Rd (nr Baker St\nStation) (828-8070 ext 4176).\nIC Halls/Evelyn G dns/ Earls Ct Sq/Redcliffe St\nJob Cente and Unemployment\nBenefit Office: Wyfold Rd, SW6(3852241)(70/74 bus, ask for\nKingwood Rd).\nSupplementary Benefit Office:\nWaterford House, Waterford Rd,\nSW6 (736 3399).\nTown Hall: Kensington and Chelsea,\nHornton St, W8 (937 5464) (R&R Rebate forms for this area are\navailable from Students Services).\nLexham G dns Job Centre and Unemployment\nBenefit Office and SB Office the\nsame as Hamlet Gdns.
