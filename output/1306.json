Upbeat and\nuplifting, it\u2019s described to me by the\nband as \u201ca pop classic\u201d.\nIt\u2019s certainly catchy, but the use\nof the word \u2018pop\u2019 is a brave one.\nThe justification for this is probably\nBeric\u2019s voice, which is smooth and\npowerful. There\u2019s nothing unfashionable about this; take away The\nMusic\u2019s Robert Harvey\u2019s northern\naccent, take away his band of gurn-ing baggies, and essentially he is\na pop singer. Most singers in most\nindie bands are pop singers, only\nmore introverted.\nSo why are they not a \u2018pop band\u2019?\nWell, they write interesting songs,\nthey are all very proficient musi-cians, and... oh yeah, they\u2019re not a\nPop Band because of Simon Herd\u2019s\nguitar. This is proper rock guitar,\nand the distorted sound is the glue\nthat stops the melodies being too\nsugary. Not only does it fill the gaps,\nbut when he plays guitar solos in\nindie songs it gives the band their\nidentity. In set closer and EP lead\ntrack Sunrise there is an amazing riff that\u2019s played throughout\nthe song, and the almost excessive\nchoppiness of the endings are both\naurally and visually effective.\nThey know when to turn it down\nas well, such as on the sublime\nClutching At Straws, where Dom\n(acoustic guitar/keyboards) picks\nout a gorgeous acoustic guitar part\nbelow Beric\u2019s floating vocals and\nLeanna\u2019s light drums. What makes\nthe band work is how the parts come\ntogether, such as in Know Your\nPeace where Simon\u2019s guitar part\ncould be northern rock upstarts The\nOpen, Damian\u2019s bass and Dom\u2019s\npiano are bouncy, and Beric\u2019s vocals\nare rich and mellow. And then it all\ncomes together to sound like, well,\nThe Healing Fields.\nTo sum them up, essentially they\nare an indie band with a pop singer\nand a rock guitarist. And it works,\nwhich is an amazing thing, and\ndeserving of accolade in itself. Add\nto that the fact they write songs with\npersonality and individuality, and it\ncan only be a matter of time before\nthey\u2019re walking all over every boring\ngarage band in London.\nJames Millen\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nFields and Caves\nFelix checks out up-and-coming band The Healing Fields, and catches\nNick Cave\u2019s legendary live show\nBrilliance\nfrom\nThe Open,\ntorture from\nBusted\nSINGLE REVIEWS\nWhy The Open never released the\nmore rocking tracks from their\ndebut album The Silent Hours\nhas always confused me. Granted,\nClose My Eyes and Just Want To\nLive were amazing slices of emotive indie, but Elevation was just\npap. So at last they have released a\nsong that sounds like all the\nbest bits from their album\ncondensed into two minutes 48\nseconds.\nNever Enough is actually a reissue of a much earlier song, and is\nby far their best single to date. The\nguitars are spiky, and they make\ngood use of the ever-effective rhythm\nslash. The chorus could be used as a\ndefinition for the word \u2018anthemic\u2019 in\nsome bizarre audio dictionary. They\nmake so much noise combined with\nso much melody, it really is astound-ing.\nThey just can\u2019t do wrong, these\nnorthern lads. Even the nine minute\nlong B-side Begin is brilliant, with\n1001 things going on at once, and\na space-rock stylee build up in the\nmiddle. I wait with anticipation to\nsee where they will go next.\nJames Millen\nThis is the most awful aural torture I\nhave ever subjected myself to.\nWhat\u2019s probably a positive about\nShe Wants To Be Me is the fact that\nit is unmemorable. The song just\noccurs and luckily avoids any of\nthose painful catchy hooks that this\n\u201cband\u201d produce. If she wants to be\nhim then she has pathetic aspirations in life.\nThe B-side is a live version of this\nsong that is as equally pointless as it\nis superfluous. Maybe the label realised how much of a non-entity the\nsong is that it had to repeat it just\nto remind you, yes, that was a song\nthat just happened. There\u2019s even a\nline \u201cSomebody notice, somebody\nnotice me!\u201d Is this about the girl or\nthe song?\nPutting down Busted is a popular pastime, so if you need more\nammunition to fire at said bushy\neyebrowed band then put this in\nyour stereo. From the first predictable drum roll opening to the \u2018Yeah,\nwe\u2019re heavy! (in a Darkness kind\nof way)\u2019 ending, I can\u2019t begin to\nexpress my distaste at these three\nboychildren taking turns to flog the\ndead horse that is pop-punk. But\nthey do have pretty smiles.\nMatthew Hoban\nThe Open\nNever Enough\nPolydor\nHHHHI\nThe Healing Fields\nWestOneFour, Fulham\nHHHHI\nThe Healing Fields are a five-piece\nfrom London, and their melody-driven, rich indie has been getting\nthem noticed. They recently won\nbest unsigned band in London\nat a competition at Sound in\nLeicester Square, and they topped\nan unsigned band chart for six\nweeks. They take their name from\nthe Glastonbury field, and say\nthey wanted a name that encapsulated the festival spirit. The band\nformed in January 2003, mainly\nplaying in London, but they have\nalso played the Castle Rock festival in Cornwall and Pride on Tyde\nin Newcastle. They are prolific\nwriters of material, and have just\nheaded into the same studio as\nwhite noise merchants My Vitriol\nto record their debut EP\n. And Paul\nGambaccini\u2019s a fan!\nCheck out www.thehealingfields.\ncom to hear some tracks, and see\nthem support Countermine on 24\nNovember at the Clapham Grand.\nwho are they?\nLIVE REVIEWS\nThere is something wonderful about\nNick Cave: his svelte, ageless figure\nwith that jet black mop and those\nangst-ridden lyrics penetrating into\nthe deepest recesses of the soul.\nIf there is one word to sum up his\nperformance last Friday, the last of\nthe three London shows, it is this:\nthrilling.\nFollowing the opening by the ethereal sounding Mercury Rev, the dark\nprince and his twelve-strong Seeds\n(including a choir of four) took the\nstage for a night to remember.\nThe first set of songs were all from\nthe newly released double album\nAbattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus\n(at least this is my assumption as I\nam ashamed to say that I did not\nknow any). With my mental notebook working overtime, particularly\nnoteworthy were Abattoir Blues (to\nopen), There It Goes, My Beautiful\nWorld, and Easy Money with Nick at\nhome on piano. The songs sounded\nwell rehearsed and carefully placed,\nall building up into amazing crashing crescendos. Also here was The\nLyre Of Orpheus, spoken as only\nNick Cave can, with dark and deep\nchoruses of \u201coh mama\u201d emanating from the choir. I may not have\nknown the new album before the\ngig but I do now: Nick Cave sold it\nto me hands down. Incidentally, I\nam also now the proud owner of one\nLyre Of Orpheus tea towel with all\nthe lyrics.\nOn stage Nick certainly had pres-ence, and he knew how to use it.\nDressed in a beautifully cut suit\nwith a fitted white shirt, he did\nindeed look rather dashing as he\nmoved about the stage with angular,\nelectric style. As a fellow admirer in\nthe audience kept shouting: \u201cNice\nass, Nick\u201d.\nI\u2019d offer praise too for his ability\nto sing and chain-smoke simultaneously (he must have gone through a\nsmall packet of fags while on stage):\nthe consummate professional.\nIn the second set, things got a\nlittle more raw as he left the newer\nmaterial to give us the old favourites we craved, and it was nice (I\nsecretly admit) to recognise some\nof the songs. The powerful Red\nRight Hand, Deanna, with violinist\nWarren Ellis working overtime, and\nThe Weeping Song were featured\nhere. There is nothing quite like\nhearing your favourite lyrics live\nand Nick did it so perfectly, so effort-lessly. The tongue-in-cheek parody\nGod Is In The House sounded very\nfine as my favourite lines rang out:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve bred all our kittens white\nso you can see them in the night\u201d.\nNick, at one point, was in a whisper\nand the audience craned to take\nit in.\nWhile my companion, Julie, and\nI wished he had played more of the\nsongs we knew, for someone with\nso many albums (19, no less) there\nwas a lot to choose from. Nick Cave\nstrikes me as someone who likes to\nexperiment, who might get bored\njust belting out hits to an adoring\naudience, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise that\na good part of the concert concentrated on his new stuff.\nThere was one more encore before\nit was time for us all to pick our\nway through the mass of discarded\nplastic pint glasses and out into the\ncold night. Lastly, with a \u201cGoodbye\nLondon, see you in another couple\nof years\u201d, The Mercy Seat got an\nairing. It sounded just as it was\nmeant to, soul food for the depraved,\nand the audience was transfixed. I\u2019ll\nbe there next time, Nick: you rock.\nZo\u00eb Corbyn\nNick Cave\nCarling Academy Brixton\nHHHHI\nNick Cave live: it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re there, slipping on plastic pint pots\nBusted\nShe Wants To Be Me\nMCA\nIIIII\nThe Healing Fields\nNick Cave: he really, really likes to smoke\n\n"

The\ncity, which has been a centre\nfor insurgents, was attacked\nby the American and Black\nWatch troops before a house-to-house search was per-formed. Almost all the town\u2019s\ninhabitants had fled to refugee camps and the city was\nnearly destroyed.\nWhile American troops\nbegan cleaning up and\nrebuilding \u2013 desperate that\nthe people didn\u2019t return to\nsee bodies in the road and\ntheir houses torn down \u2013 their\nbehaviour was under scrutiny.\nThe Red Crescent, an Iraqi\naid agency, complained that\nthey had been stopped from\nbringing supplies into the city\nby the troops, who wish to\nrun the aid themselves. Even\nmore seriously, television\nfootage of a marine shooting,\nat close range, an unarmed\nand apparently helpless Iraqi\nfighter was aired. The soldier\nwas immediately removed\nfrom duty while an investigation was carried out.\nSome of the best articles\nabout Falluja come from The\nTimes, which has an extremely good reporter \u2018embedded\u2019\nwith the marines. While he\nreported tactics and the mood\namong the troops, the antiwar Guardian focused on the\nnews that the Iraqi elections\nmay not take place in January\nas planned, due to the insur-gency.\nThis would be seriously bad\nnews for Tony Blair, especially\nif it dragged on into his campaigning time for our general\nelection in May, suggesting\nas it does that there is no\norder in Iraq and the coalition\nhave not really \u2018won\u2019 anything\nyet. It is bad news too for\nPresident Bush \u2013 the later the\nelections are, the longer he\nhas to pay for everything.\nNearly all the newspapers\nwere engrossed in the news\nthatBorisJohnsonwassacked\nas Tory arts spokesman for\nhaving an affair with a journalist on The Spectator (which\nhe edits) and then allegedly\nlying to his leader Michael\nHoward about it. Surprisingly,\nmost of the papers argued\nthat there was really no need\nfor him to go, especially as\nMr Howard was himself cited\nin divorce proceedings after\n\u2018winning\u2019 his wife away from\nher then husband.\nThe Guardian pointed out\nthat politics is the last profession in which it is possible to be sacked for adultery,\nsuggesting it is bizarre to\nthink that we the public suggest high moral standards of\nMPs when we believe they\nare always lying and cheating anyway. The Mail disa-greed, saying that cabinet\nor shadow cabinet ministers\nshould set an example of\nhonesty and integrity. They\nmay have a point in that the\nTories are desperate to cut\nout the sleaze allegations that\ndogged them throughout the\nnineties, although this seems\nto be going a bit far.\nJohnson has denied lying\nabout the affair, and is predicted by all to have a quick\nreturn to politics. Some pundits suggested that the reason for his departure was that\nsenior Tories are jealous of\nhis media success; others\nthat Boris is in fact being cunning and getting out now so\nthat after the general election he can appear as a \u2018new\nbroom\u2019 not associated with\nMr Howard\u2019s time as leader,\nready to start his own leadership challenge.\nMeanwhile, The Mail was\nnot, for once, talking about\nasylum seekers. It had moved\nits radar to focus on the new\n\u2018threat\u2019 to our way of life, gyp-sies. It greeted with horror\nthe news that the Government\nis suggesting that local councils increase the number of\nsites available for parking for\ntravellers. None of the other\nnewspapers really picked up\non this story so I suspect this\nmay well turn into another\nCampaign where only The\nMail can save us. Watch this\nspace!\nJustice, Johnson and gypsies\nReading the newspapers so you don\u2019t have to: Emily Gwyer looks at some of the week\u2019s\nbiggest national news stories\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nResearchers at Imperial\nCollege have found that levels\nof hepatitis C among young\ninjecting drug users across\nLondon are dangerously\nhigh.\nThe sample consisted of 428\ninjecting drug users aged 30\nor younger. 42% of those who\ntested negative at the beginning of the study became\ninfected with hepatitis C within the first year, while 3.4%\nbecame infected with HIV.\nDr Ali Judd, who is based at\nCharing Cross Hospital and\nis one of the authors of the\nstudy, said: \u201cHepatitis C is\nnow spreading at epidemic\nlevels across London and HIV\nincidence is worryingly high...\nThere is an urgent need for\nnew and comprehensive programmes to tackle this growing problem.\u201d\nThe hepatitis C virus can\ncause serious liver damage,\nand is mainly spread by sharing needles and syringes.\nFactors that may have influenced the rise in hepatitis\nand HIV infection include a\nrise in the number of injec-tors, riskier injecting behav-iour, no increase in the numbers of syringes distributed,\nand a lack of targeted health\ncampaigns, according to the\nresearchers.\n\u25cf The Imperial College\nHealth Centre\u2019s 24 hour\ntelephone number is 020\n7584 6301.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 18 November 2004\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk\n17\nBy Mark Flower\nTen paddlers, three hire\ncars, the large expanse that\nis British Columbia, and a\ncollection of rivers that just\ncannot be found in Europe: a\nrecipe for a good summer.\nThanks to the generous support of the Imperial\nCollege Expedition Board,\nwe were off to Canada. Early\none morning in August, we\nfound ourselves at Gatwick\nairport, attempting to check\nin an inordinate amount of kit\nincluding nine kayaks and full\nopen canoe. After an eleven\nhour monster flight, we found\nourselves in sunny Vancouver\nin the middle of a heat wave.\nThe next morning found us\ninMEC(MountainEquipment\nCo-op, a fine establishment\nthat we visited on many occa-sions) buying even more\nstuff. When we finally managed to drag ourselves out of\nthis shopping paradise several hours later, we climbed\ninto our hire cars and headed\nnorth towards Squamish and\nWhistler in search of white\nwater.\nWe settled first on the\nElaho, a really big volume\nriver with large wave trains.\nThe river proved to be a bit\ntoo much of a challenging\nstart for some of us, who very\nsensibly decided to walk off.\nAt that point we realised just\nhow much BC had to offer.\nThis expedition was going to\nbe truly awesome.\nOver the next few days, we\nran a variety of rivers in the\narea. Some were mellow pretty paddles, and some were\nblocked by logjams large\nenough to make a beaver\nblush. One of the most successful runs was the middle\nCheakamus, a classy medium\nvolume run, with one harder drop. As the river is dam\nreleased, some of the boys\nspent a while discussing how\nto destroy it allowing more\nwater to be released. Since\nImperial College is not an\ninternational terrorist organi-sation, nothing was done and\nwe set off down the river with\nits really warm water (going\nback to Wales in winter is\ngoing to be a bit of a shock to\nthe system).\nOne classic run that was\nmore challenging was the\nupper Cheakamus. This was\nthoroughly enjoyed by all who\nran it. Another, Callaghan\nCreek, offered great clean\nwaterfalls, which made up\nfor the long and arduous\nput in. Thankfully an easier\nroute to the river was eventually found, but unfortunately this was only after\nthe river had actually been\nrun. The Cal-cheak section\nof the Cheakamus was a fun\nrun which the entire group\nenjoyed.\nA few days later saw us\nheading off the world-famous\nSchookumchuck play wave\n(one of the top ten play spots\nin the world apparently).\nNaturally we passed\nthrough Vancouver, and\nequally naturally that included a stop in MEC. We found\na beautiful camp site on a\nsecluded, quiet and peaceful\nlake, which was perfect for\nmessing about both in and\nout of our boats. The next few\ndays were spent on the wave.\nTo get to the wave you have to\nwalk 3-4km carrying all your\nkit. Those of us not paddling\nlooked very smug. The local\ndiner served up the biggest\nburgers any of us had ever\nseen, which refuelled us tired\npaddlers.\nLeaving our campsite early\non the Wednesday, we stopped\nbriefly in Vancouver, dropped\nin to MEC, and out along the\nUS-Canadian border, just\nmanaging to squeeze a section of the river Chilliwack\nin before dark. That evening\nwas marked by an amazing\nmeteor shower \u2013 unlike anything the south east of the\nUK gets. With total darkness\nand not a cloud in the sky it\nwas an evening to remember.\nThe next day we hooked up\nwith a local open boater and\nran more of the Chilliwack,\nincluding a very scenic gorge\nsection.\nWhile some ventured up\nto the upper reaches of the\nNahatlach, the rest of us\nwent off to the Thompson.\nThe Thompson is a big river\n\u2013 600 tonnes of water flowed\ndown it every second while\nwe were there. I\u2019ll describe\nit as having huge whirlpools,\neddy lines and wave trains.\nYou can imagine the rest. It\nwas enormous fun, although\nonly after I got over the fear\nof it.\nMonday was Clearwater\nday. Vancouver Canoe Club\nhad recommended it to us.\nAlthough the water was warm\n(although not as warm as the\n18\u02daC Nahatlatch), the river\nwas reasonably flat, with only\ntwo rapids of any note. We\nalso had spent a long time\nat the top of the river, while\nRob fixed the hire car he had\njust broken. The Clearwater\nwas good, but I felt as though\nthere was something missing by the time we had hit\nthe bottom. Rob, Alice and\nJames made up for it by having an impromptu bath. We\ntowed their boats to the side\nfor them.\nLeaving the Clearwater\nthe next day, we drove up a\nstupid (4x4 only) dirt track\nto our next river, the Chilco.\nSix in the morning is no time\nto be out of bed, unless you\nhave a very good reason. We\ndid \u2013 the Chilco. We were\ncamped at the take out, and\neven though we left at 6am\nit was 12.30 before most of us\ngot on the water. The roads\nwere that bad.\nThe river itself was (and\nI\u2019m running out of superlatives here) brilliant. The\nentry rapid to the river was\nhuge. Three of us swam down\nit \u2013 Claire, Harry and myself.\nHarry went left (after being\ntold to go right) while Claire\nand I were munched by the\nhuge waves. Claire had it bad\n\u2013 after spending the fist half\nof the rapid upside down trying to roll (further than me by\nall accounts) she swam, and\nthen spent the second half\nof the rapid swimming to the\nsurface.\nEventually we were all reunited with our kit (Harry having dropped his paddle). The\nsecond half of the river was\nunique. I have never paddled\nanything like it. With large\nwaves and large piles of water\n(so large some of us got completely airborne as we went\nover them), it was awesome.\nCoupled with the five or six\nbrown bears we spotted on\nthe bank (some within half a\nmile of the campsite), it was a\nbunch of happy paddlers who\ncrawled into the camp site\nthat evening.\nThursday dawned. After\nfloating down the Chilco to\nthe main road (in an effort\nto make the cars lighter) we\nsaddled up, and drove off to\nthe Quesnel. With some great\nwaves and a memorable\n(though short) gorge section,\nthe river was great and we\narrived back at the campsite,\nagain, complete with smiles.\nOn the Friday we ran\nthe Caribou. It was like the\nQuesnel, except for one fea-ture, a five metre V-shaped\nfall. Rob was doing alright\nuntil he reached the flat bit\nat the bottom. Then he got\nscared and pulled his deck (at\nleast that\u2019s what it looked like\nfrom the bank...) He maintains that the river popped\nhis deck. We just laughed\nand kept filming. All this took\nplace while the salmon were\ntrying to leap up the water\nfall. None made it.\nAfter driving through the\nnight, we arrived next to the\nHolmes river. This river was\ncold, much like Scotland can\nbe over new year. Fed by\nmelting glaciers, the water\nhad little time to warm up,\nand we spent much of our\ntime doing everything in our\npower to keep our hands out\nof the water \u2013 this included\npaddling with hands next to\neach other in the centre of\nthe paddle.\nTheo also managed to\npoach us a couple of salmon from the river. We had to\ncook them surreptitiously on\nthe fire, since we had some\nfishermen camped next to us\nwho explained that fishing\nChinook salmon was illegal.\nWe were a long way north\nnow, and although it was\nstill August the weather was\nstarting to turn against us.\nIt was getting cold at night.\nWith less than a week left in\nCanada we pressed on, doing\nthe river Dore. Again, this\nwas split into two sections\nwith the upper prosecuted by\nthe remaining lads. When I\narrived at the road up to the\nDore, we found that the road\nbridge had been ripped up\nand was in the process of\nbeing replaced. Deciding not\nto drive across it we started\nwalking, meeting the others\nhigher up. The middle was a\nlot of fun, although much like\nthe Holmes it was really cold.\nWe met a dude from Quebec\nthat night, who escorted us\nto the upper Fraser. While\nthe Fraser is truly huge at\nVancouver, further up it is a\ngood deal smaller (but still\nnot insignificant in size).\nOverlander falls are on this\nsection. The entire river\ndrops about 15m into a pool\nbelow. Tim had a picture of\nthis fall on this bedroom wall\nat home, and he stared long\nand hard at it. There is a\nline down it, but if you screw\nit up slightly, it\u2019s bad news.\nYou can\u2019t be rescued from the\nbank, it\u2019s just too big. Tim was\npractically sick by the time\nhe decided to do the sensible\nthing and walk around the\nfall.\nAfter this we drove for a\nbit to the river Canoe (great\nname eh?) This is continuous grade three water which\nis, again, glacier melt (read\ncold). This river did not stop\nonce. For the entire 6-7km\nthat we were on the river, you\nhad to plot every single line.\nThis river had it all \u2013 further\ndown, it got less continuous\nand had a few harder drops\ncontained within it.\nOn the Wednesday we\ndrove to the Lillooet, back\ntowards Vancouver. Although\nwe arrived too late to do the\nsection we drove over a silly\nlooking river called Pebble\nCreek. Obviously it needed\nrunning. The lads then ran\nit, although there was only\nthe one place to stop in 800m.\nTim described it as \u2018being\ntrashed while still upright\u2019.\nThe Thursday was a special day. Usually in Wales\nwe manage two rivers a day.\nPreviously on the expedition we had been managing\none most days. On Thursday\nsome people ran four. The\npebble was the first. This\ntime they walked up it a bit\nbefore putting on. Next we\nall ran the Lillooet. After this\nwe drove to the Green, a nice\ngrade three paddle. It was\nfun, aside from the put in,\nwhich required us to paddle\nacross a dirty great lake first.\nFinally a few of the lads ran\nthe Soo.\nThe final river we ran (on\nthe ensuing Friday) was the\nCalcheack. This was a repeat\nrun from when we had run it\npreviously. I got to do it this\ntime. Much as it said on the\ntin, it was a great run, with a\nfantastic play wave halfway\ndown.\nOur time was over. We were\ndone. Returning to Vancouver\n(and naturally enough to MEC\nagain) we stayed overnight\nin the youth hostel before\nscattering to the four winds.\nMost people flew back on the\nSunday.\nWe would like to thank the\nImperial College Expedition\nBoard (www.imperial.ac.uk/\nexpeditions) who supported\nthe trip. If you would like to\ntry kayaking yourself (start-ing with the easy stuff), see\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/canoe, or\nemail canoe@ic.ac.uk.\nCANOE CLUB\nUp the Fraser without a...\nCanoeist Jon has a refill\nA 15m drop near the Overlander Falls: \u201cif you screw it up slightly, it\u2019s bad news...\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Meet the recruiters\nCareers felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 18 November 2004 15\nFancy a job in TV?\nBy Cassandra Aldrich\nCareers Editor\nOne sector that probably surpasses all others in terms of\ncompetitiveness is the media.\nIts ever-increasing influence and technology-driven\nexpansion means there are a\nnumber of diverse jobs within\nthe industry, which appeal to\na great many people.\nTo find out how best to\nbreak into this media world, I\ngot hold of an insider, who primarily works as a television\neditor but also makes his own\ndocumentaries. Rather than\nworking directly for a com-pany, he is employed by directors or producers to work on\ndifferent projects.\nDespite finding success (no\nsmall feat in television), making good money and working\non some interesting assign-ments, he spent the first part\nof the conversation trying\nhard to put me off. I then\nmanaged to gain some good\nadvice for anyone who wants\nto get into television.\nPrior experience before\napplying for a position is a\nnecessity, not only as evidence of commitment, but\nalso because you can\u2019t expect\nto be trained from scratch on\nthe job \u2013 there are too many\npeople who want the job,\nmost of whom will have the\nexpertise. So how do you go\nabout climbing the first rung\nand getting the experience?\nIf you\u2019re extremely lucky\nyou may be able to secure\nan internship with a company\nlike the BBC or Granada, but\neven for this you will need to\nhave done something as evidence of keen interest.\nA good way is to take a\nthree-step approach \u2013 the first\nstep being to get involved with\nthe university media groups.\nUniversity societies are open\nto all, so this is a sure way of\ngaining some basic experi-ence, requiring only that you\ndevote some time. The next\nstep would be to do some voluntary work for a small, independent film-making group.\nA couple of websites contain\ninformation about groups\nmaking low-budget documentaries or shortfilms (check\nout www.shootingpeople.org\nand www.dfglondon.com).\nRinging up and offering\nyour services may get you\ninvolved, but don\u2019t expect to\nbe paid or have an exciting\nrole initially. You may also\nneed a substantial amount\nof free time, so it\u2019s probably\nbest to line something up for\nthe summer holidays. Finally,\nafter building up your skills\nbase and CV, you will be better equipped to go after the\nparticular placement or job\nyou want, perhaps with a\ncompany or large media cor-poration.\nTelevision is a pretty small\nworld in terms of the people who control and run it,\nwhich is another reason for\nnot going into a big company\nwhen inexperienced \u2013 it will\nget around if you\u2019ve done\na bad job, which would be\ncareer suicide before you\u2019ve\neven started. The same\napplies to radio and news\npublications \u2013 be prepared\nto start small and then work\nyour way up.\nA course in media or journalism is not a prerequisite to\nwork in the industry \u2013 many\nin the business have such a\ndegree, but many also don\u2019t.\nAs experience will quickly\nbring non-media graduates up to speed on how it\nall works, the main advantage of the good courses is\nthat they\u2019ll assist students to\nsecure work placements.\nMotivation, of course, is\nessential \u2013 ringing up company switchboards, asking\nto speak to the production\nmanagers of particular pro-grammes, and then unashamedly selling yourself is\noften the best way to get your\nfoot in the door. It\u2019s more a\ncase of actively seeking work\nrather than just applying for\njob postings. Hold off phoning the production manager\nof your favourite programme\nuntil you have something to\noffer them.\nAnother tip I was given is\nto learn a technical skill, such\nas editing, vision or sound-mixing, even if you dream\nof directing your own films.\nTechnical skills are more\nin demand, and people with\nsuch skills often get paid better than the directors them-selves. Once through the\ndoor, you may then move into\nanother area, but you\u2019ll still\nbe more employable with an\nadditional skill.\nIf you\u2019re still determined\nto work in the media then\nprepare yourself for making\ncups of tea, being broke for\nthe first few years, having to\nsometimes work on projects\nyou hate, continual knock\nbacks, and sadly, at the end\nof it all, no assurances of suc-cess. After all the gloom I\nshould mention the flip-side,\nbut it speaks for itself \u2013 who\nisn\u2019t somewhat allured by the\nidea of television and film?\nBy Gabriella Silvestri\nCareers Editor\nFinding recruiters offering\ngraduate schemes is relatively easy, especially at Imperial,\nsurely one of the universities\nmost loved by employers.\nFollowing the time-hon-oured principle that you\nshould \u2018try before you\nbuy\u2019, recruitment fairs and\nemployer presentations are\na great chance to get an\nopinion before you leap into\nemployment with a company.\nTheir presentations are also\na great opportunity to talk to\nyoung graduates who were\nprobably struggling to make\nthe same job choices as you.\nBy the end of a presentation,\nyou should know whether you\nwant to work for the firm and\nwill have collected enough\ninformation to commit yourself and make it through the\nfirst step.\nAs promised, here is an in-depth overview on Procter &\nGamble, developed by attending their corporate presentation here at Imperial. To\nbe honest with you, I had no\nintention to get such accurate\nknowledge of the company,\nand my interest in P&G was\nsolely to inform you about the\nevent. Well, I have to say you\nnever know what is in store,\nand although the company\nwas not in my top 10 origi-nally, it became so at the end\nof the evening.\nI found the company very\nchallenging and this aspect\ncaptured me straight away,\nbeing myself an ambitious\nperson. The presentation was\nfollowed by an informal gath-ering, which is the most helpful part of the event. It was\nduring this informal chat that\nI got my name down on their\nlist of \u2018strong\u2019 candidates and\nthis is the way my involvement with P&G started.\nI will not go into many\ndetails about the company, as\nyou will get bored if P&G does\nnot stimulate your curiosity;\ninstead, I am going to highlight aspects that can be useful to you whichever company\nyou choose to go for.\nFor a start, what do they\nlook out for throughout their\nselection process? They talk\nabout Success Actions for\nWinning (SAWs), such as\nLeadership, Innovation, Risk\nTaking and Mastery to name\na few. The P&G community consists of nearly 98,000\npeople working in almost 80\ncountries worldwide, providing branded products as\nPampers, Pringles, Bounty,\nOlay and Pantene. Their philosophy is that people are the\nfoundation of their success:\n\u201cIf you took away all our fac-tories, all our money, but left\nour people, we would rebuild\nthe entire organization within\n10 years. If you left all of our\npossessions and took away\nonly our people, we would be\ncompletely destroyed\u201d.\nThere are plenty of possibilities for careers: you\ncan choose from marketing,\nfinance, information technology and sales to human\nresources, product supply\nand research and develop-ment.\nFollowing my research\nabout the company and their\npurposes, principles and val-ues, I was invited to a \u2018Get\nin Touch\u2019 recruitment event\nat a bar in London. This\nkind of event aims to give\nyou the opportunity for some\none-to-one contact with P&G\nemployees and to establish a\nsingle point of contact for the\nfuture application process. It\nwas quite a good experience,\nand awkward at the same\ntime, seeing your potential\nemployers in a different envi-ronment.\nDuring the evening, I made\nsure I was clear on the application process and its dead-line, and I also gained a better\nfeeling of the people and the\natmosphere within the com-pany.\nAs part of their recruitment process, I was then\ninvited to a one day Business\nSkills course as well at their\nHeadquarters in Weybridge\nnear the P&G building. The\nday was very challenging and\nproductive as I learnt a lot\nabout the company through\ntheir presentations on leadership and objective setting,\nadvertising and advance communication skills.\nI had an insight into the\ncompany vision and strategy\nthat made it easier for me\nto fill in the application form\nafterwards, knowing exactly\nwhat people they are looking\nfor. We were then taken for a\ntour in the P&G main building\nwhere you could even smell\nand taste the Pringles!\nThe application form asked\nfor clear examples of times\nwhen you have worked in\na team or made a difficult\ndecision. After submitting a\nfirst part, they send you a\nmultiple choice questionnaire\nback, focused more on your\npersonality as an individual.\nAn important tip is to apply\nfirst for an internship (if an\nundergraduate) or for one of\ntheir courses (if doing a PhD)\nbecause 90% of the people\nthey recruit for jobs are from\nthese programmes.\nThey want a well-rounded\ncandidate who can clearly\nshow evidence of the skills\ndeveloped from extra-cur-ricular activities, beyond the\nacademic records. They want\nto hear about your achievements in clubs and societies,\nvoluntary and community\nwork and paid work. They\nwant to see a person capable\nof making a significant differ-ence. Working for them will\ntake you almost anywhere in\nthe world and joining their\nGo, Give and Grow (GGG)\nscheme you will take part in\na humanitarian project. Most\nlikely, you will be based in a\ndeveloping country for one\nyear with a salary, working as\npartofaprojectteamaddress-ing global health issues.\nI hope my experience will\nhave stimulated your curiosity and given you just a\nglimpse of what it could be\nlike working at P&G.\nLike Pringles?

It\u2019s\ntherefore fitting that Goldrush play\nthere following their return from an\nAmerican tour.\nThe first support band Tanaou fill\nthe stage with their six members.\nThey make a strange sound, coming on like Alfie trying to write the\nscore for a teen romantic comedy.\nIt\u2019s good, as awful as that sounds,\nthough their singer could do with\nsome lessons on tuning.\nGoldrush launch straight into\nnew material from their Ozona EP,\nnamed after the yokel nowheres-ville they broke down in on tour.\nIntroduced as a song about \u201ctrying things I shouldn\u2019t in the Joshua\nTree desert\u201d, Things I\u2019ve Lost\ndisplays a fair chunk of their musical arsenal; honey-coated vocals,\nsharp and jangly guitars, and beautifully harmonious melodies. Lead\ntrack from the EP\n, Wait For The\nWheels, has a stomping rhythm\nand catchy chorus. It\u2019s uplifting\nand rousing, putting a harder edge\non their normally indier-than-thou\nsound.\nNext up are a couple of old songs.\nTo my extreme relief, they play the\ncrowd-pleasing and glorious anthem\nthat is Let You Down, a song that\nstarts so tender it turns your legs\nto jelly, and finishes with powerful\nlayers of sound that hit you right\nin the gut. Secondly they play their\n\u201csmash hit\u201d Wide Open Sky, an unashamedly poppy song that is summer condensed into three and a half\nminutes.\nGetting back to the new songs they\nplay the offbeat, and undoubtedly\nbrilliant, Jupiter and the oddly dark\nThere\u2019s A World. Upon urging the\ncrowd to come to the front (which\nsees everyone shuffle shyly forwards\na couple of inches) they launch into\nthe rocky 52nd State, a track that\nmakes little sense on record, but\ncomes together live. I never thought\nI\u2019d live to see Goldrush go rock!\nThey finish on an as yet unrecorded track, which has a picked acoustic\nmelody overlaid by odd spacey electric guitar noises. In the customary\nencore, front man Robin is joined by\nco-vocalist and keyboardist Rob to\nplay a pretty acoustic track, before\nthe band finish with live favourite\nCounting Song, leaving a jubilant\ncrowd drenched in feedback.\nThough not exactly a new band,\nGoldrush have obviously benefited\nfrom a heavy touring schedule, and\nlook set to bring their own brand of\nuplifting indie to an ever-increasing\naudience.\nJames Millen\nGoldrush\nThe Borderline\nHHHHI\nThe Thrills: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna give you such a kicking\u201d\nSINGLE REVIEW\nBack with the latest excerpt from\nLet\u2019s Bottle Bohemia (Bohemia\nbeing quite a large part of the Czech\nRepublic, in case you\u2019re interested),\nThe Thrills have gone for a nice\npiano ballad.

However, for\nNovember\u2019s session, LTJ had something special in mind: a re-union, a\nchance to celebrate tunes of a certain vintage, and relive hazy memo-ries. It was time to return to Speed.\nIt was also our return to The\nEnd, after a long year\u2019s absence.\nHaving braved the arctic November\nwinds to rendezvous in Mornington\nCrescent, anticipation levels were\nsteadily fuelled by a few hours drink-ing. We touched down at the venue\nat around 11.30pm to be greeted by\nthe sight of a phat queue. However,\nthe efficient door staff moved things\non with a minimal amount of fuss,\nand before long we were inside the\nride. Descending down into that\nmost legendary of London base-ments, we were greeted by lights,\nsmoke, drums and bass \u2013 it was\ngood to be back.\nAfter a quick excursion to the bar,\nit was directly into the main room\nwhere things were obviously already\nin full effect. DJ Ink was at the helm,\nmixing tidily through a neat selection of atmospheric rollers. There\nhas already been much said in these\npages about the merits of The End\nas a venue, but a special mention\nmust be made of the atmosphere on\nthis night. The stark but stylish interior of the club complemented the\nbrand of futuristic music to a T and\nthe hundreds of people, shrouded\nin smoke, occasionally lit by a laser\ndisplay, were in full appreciation.\nAt this point it was time for a brief\nfunk interlude in the second room,\ncourtesy of a certain Jazzy B (\u201cback\nto life, back to reality\u2026\u201d) representing the soul2soul sound system.\nThe vibe was nice, and bodies were\nbeing shaken left, right and centre.\nHowever, one was always conscious\nof the events that were to take place\nin the main room \u2013 namely the main\nattraction, LTJ Bukem alongside\nthe ever faithful MC Conrad.\nLTJ is renowned for his musi-cal, string-fuelled take on drum\nand bass, and what can be said\nexcept that his performance lived\nup to all expectations \u2013 and then\nsome. The Speed era was one of\nthe most creative periods the D&B\ngenre has witnessed, and in this\nset we were treated to some of its\nfinest moments. Key tunes included\nBukem\u2019s own Horizons and PFM\u2019s\nOne and Only, not to mention\nthe tumbling sounds of J Majik\u2019s\nRepertoire. These were, of course,\ncomplemented by the melodic tones\nand conscious raps of Conrad, one of\nthe great MC\u2019s who is not afraid to\nlet the music do the talking.\nAs Bukem\u2019s finale wound down,\nthe crowd\u2019s response reflected the\nquality of the music. Who could possibly hope follow such a perform-ance? Does such an entity exist?\nThere was only one man it could\nhave been...\nFabio, the liquid master, stepped\nup in his own inimitable style at\naround 3am and to be honest he\ncould have left after his first tune.\nDigging deep to intro with that classic of classics, Atlantis (I Need You),\nthe tone was set. What followed was\nnothing less than an exquisite concoction of strings, warm bass and\nserious rhythms from circa 1996.\nHighlights included Alex Reese\u2019s\nPulp Fiction, whose pulsating\nbassline sounded gargantuan on\nthe thunderidge rig, and Digital\u2019s\nSpacefunk \u2013 you just had to look into\nthe DJ booth to see what this tune\nmeant to the Speed originators: the\namen dropped, Fabio bounced like a\nman possessed, LTJ amost snapped\nhis neck from excessive nodding and\nMC Conrad sincerely suggested that\nit be rewound back to the T-O-P\n.\nCome 4am, with metabolic rates\nexcited by the frequencies and\nrhythms, we made our exit. At this\ntime in the morning, having experienced such a venue and musical\ngoodness, there is very little one can\ndo but buy some crab flavoured noodles from the local all-night shop,\nand recount the previous hours beat\nby beat.\nAnthony Roberts\nReturn to Speed\nFabio and LTJ Bukem are two of the godfathers of drum and bass.

    "content": "With over 250 clubs and societies, wide-ranging commercial facilities and\nentertainments, combined with advice and support services as well as\nresponsibility for student development and academic representation, your Union is\nnot only at the core of College life, but also is a major business, with a turnover of\nalmost \u00a36 million.\nWith such a diverse range of activities and with significant\nresources under direct student control, we now need to look\ntowards the future.\nWhat students want and need from their Union is changing and so the Union has\nto manage its resources and optimise their effectiveness so that we serve you \u2013 our\nstudent members \u2013 better. The Union must adopt a far more strategic approach to\nits operations and move forward to ensure we provide the best for our students.\nWe need to have a strategy in place for the coming years that helps us to capitalise\nto maximum effect on the talents and enthusiasm of students, staff, and other\nstakeholders.\nIt\u2019s also clear that there needs to be a radical review of the way the Union uses its\nspace, ensuring that we make those assets under Union management work for\nImperial students in the most effective way possible.\nThat is why we have now embarked on our Strategic Review.\nWhat is the Strategic Review?\nThe Strategic Review is a comprehensive overview of all that we do at the Union.\nIt is the largest and most wide-ranging appraisal ever undertaken of the Union\u2019s\nactivities. It is fully inclusive, and seeks to draw on the views of the entire student\nbody.\nIt will work by drawing on our core mission, values and beliefs, examining our\nstrengths and weaknesses and consulting widely amongst the Union\u2019s stakeholder\ncommunities.\nOnce the review is finished the Union will formulate its Strategic Plan.\nWhat is the Strategic Plan?\nThe Strategic Plan will be the starting point of the 2005-06 and subsequent annual\nplanning processes and will lay down clear performance indicators for different\naspects of the Union\u2019s activities. Work on preparing the 2005-06 Annual Plan and\nBudget will start in January 2005, for inclusion in the College Planning Round,\nbidding for more funds from College. It will have a direct influence on how the\nUnion spends its money and how staff and student volunteers spend their time\nover the next four years.\nAccompanying the Strategic Plan will be a masterplan for the Union Building in\nBeit Quadrangle, looking at how it can be improved to offer the best services to\nstudents.\nWho will be overseeing the Review and the Plan?\nUltimately, ownership of the Strategic Review and Plan is in the hands of the Union\nCouncil as governing body. Council has already approved the project concept,\nand will review the first draft and approve the final version of the Strategic Plan. The\nExecutive Committee, meeting more regularly, is overseeing the process and the\ndraft Strategy as it evolves.\nSupporting the process and representing Union Stakeholders is an Advisory\nGroup, meeting regularly during the consultation exercise. Their job is to contribute\nto and comment on papers and the process, to give feedback and to represent the\nstrategic planning process throughout the Union and stakeholder bodies.\nMost importantly, the Strategic Plan can only be developed after the widest\npossible consultation of the student body. No view counts more than that of the\nusers themselves.\nSo, how can I get my views heard?\nThe best way for everyone to be involved is to fill in the on-line survey at\nwww.union.imperial.ac.uk from Friday 19 November. But hurry, because the\ndeadline for getting your views in is Friday 26 November.\nIt is really important that you take this opportunity in shaping the future of YOUR\nstudents\u2019 union and comment on various aspects of the Union and its services and\nactivities.\nAs an added incentive to completing this survey, we will put every person who fully\ncompletes the survey into a prize draw to win a whole host of prizes, including a\nSony Playstation, a Holiday Voucher and some beer!\nWhat other consultation is being done?\nWe are consulting the clubs and societies through a separate questionnaire, which\nlooks in detail at their work and how the Union can better support student activities.\nAdditionally, from later this month, focus groups of representative samples of the\nCollege community (externally facilitated and selected randomly to give a fair\nrepresentation) will meet. They will discuss their ideas for the strategic review and\nrespond to the results of the surveys.\nIn addition, individual students and groups are invited to contribute their own ideas\nand suggestions, in writing, to union.strategy@imperial.ac.uk.\nWhat happens then?\nAfter your input the Union will put together its final Strategic Plan for 2005-2008 and\nsubmit it to the Council for approval in January.\nOnce approved, we will start to implement the plan,\nmaking the Union closer to how you want it to be,\nguaranteeing it for the future and building on our past\nsuccess.\nUnion Strategic Review\nPHOTO: IAN GILLETT\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 18 November 2004\n6\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAfter months of being afflicted with a painful verruca on\nhis foot, my brother had completely given up all hope of\never getting rid of it. He\u2019d\ntried everything the pharmacist could come up with \u2013\nbazooka that verruca my foot\n(pardon the pun), but alas, it\njust was not meant to go.\nSo I idly started to search\nthe internet for possible rem-edies, when I came across\nquite a strange idea. The cure\nwas to tape a piece of banana\nskin to the verruca and leave\nit overnight.\nIt sounded totally insane, so\nwe had to try it out of sheer\ncuriosity. I cut out some pieces of banana skin, stuck them\nto his foot with plasters, and\namazingly, the verruca disappeared overnight.\nWe were in awe of the\nfact that a banana peel had\ndone what all these highly\nresearched and patented\ndrugs failed to do.\nIt is because of these socalled reliable drugs failing,\nthat more and more people\nare turning to natural thera-pies. There\u2019s also the upside\nthat they don\u2019t play too many\ngames with your poor liver\n(which probably has enough\nproblems dealing with alcohol anyway).\nGlaxoSmithKline\u2019s shares\nhave plummeted 12% this\nyear. This has been partly\ncaused by a lawsuit against\nthe pharmaceutical giant\nclaiming they had concealed\ninformation that would have\nalerted physicians that the\nantidepressant Paxil (Seroxat\nin the UK) could be harmful to children or adolescents.\nNow, this is not the first time\na major pharmaceutical company has had a lawsuit filed\nagainst them, and in view\nof that fact a recent survey\nfound that around 70-80% of\nUS consumers have an inherent mistrust in the industry. A\nmore local survey suggested\nthat around one in five people\nin the UK have tried at least\none form of complementary\ntherapy.\nPatients are evidently\nbecoming increasingly aware\nof the side effects and limitations of conventional medi-cines, and consequently,\nmore and more are turning\nto complementary therapies.\nComplementary medicine\noften focuses on the entire\nindividual, rather than specifically targeting their afflic-tions. Diet, environment\nand lifestyle are also taken\ninto account along with the\nmental, emotional and spiritual health of the patient.\nThe treatment aims to not\nonly cure the disease, but to\npromote an overall sense of\nwell-being, hence preventing\nthe patient from a relapse.\nPatients are often actively\ninvolved in their treatments.\nRather than being prescribed\na generic drug, the treatments are very much personalised to fit the patient\u2019s\nlifestyle.\nMost complementary therapies are based on the idea\nthat the body has a natural\nability to treat any disease,\nbut just needs a kick start,\nso treatments often aim to\nstimulate this natural healing\nability in the body.\nThere are five main complementary therapies - acupunc-ture, osteopathy, chiroprac-tic, homeopathy and herbal-ism. Other popular therapies\ninclude naturopathy (natural\nremedies like sunlight, diet\nand massage), aromatherapy and massage. There are\nalso more unusual therapies\ninvolving things like magnets\nand crystals. Other cultures\nhave whole disciplines of\ncomplementary therapies,\nayurvedic medicine from\nIndia, for example.\nIn acupuncture, fine, sterile\nneedles are gently inserted\ninto selected points on the\nskin, known as acupoints.\nThis is said to balance the\nflow of vital energy (Qi, pronounced \u2018chee\u2019) in the body\nand regulate organ function.\nResearch has shown that\nacupuncture actually triggers\nthe release of endorphins in\nthe brain, so even though it\nsounds painful, it is actually\nreducing pain! Thousands\nof acupuncture studies have\nbeen carried out all over\nthe world, showing it to be\neffective for a wide range of\nailments including asthma,\nheadaches, menstrual prob-lems, digestive problems and\nhigh blood pressure. It is also\nincreasingly being used in\nobstetrics and has been found\nto reduce morning sickness\nand ease labour. The World\nHealth Organisation recognises over a hundred conditions that can be helped by\nacupuncture.\nAccording to osteopathic\ntheory, the musculoskeletal\nstructure of the body and\nits function are closely con-nected, and so spinal imbalance can lead to discomfort\nand disease. Correcting\nthe imbalance and improving the range of movement\ncan therefore both ease pain\nand improve organ function.\nIt was Dr. Andrew Taylor\nStill who devised a system\nof manipulation techniques\nknown as osteopathy to rebal-ance the framework of the\nbody, improve joint mobility\nand allow proper function of\nthe internal organs. Daniel\nDavid Palmer, a gifted amateur practitioner, believed\nthat disease was a result of\nthe nervous system functioning abnormally. He developed\ntechniques for relaxing the\nspinal muscles and freeing\nthe body\u2019s natural healing\nenergy, and this system of\ntherapy became known as\nchiropractic. Osteopathy and\nchiropractic are collectively\nknown as manipulation tech-niques.\nThese techniques have\nbeen shown to be beneficial\nfor joint and back problems,\nespecially lower back pain,\nneck stiffness and knee prob-lems. It can also help relieve\nheadaches and ear, nose and\nthroat problems. Some osteopaths and chiropractors also\ntreat general health problems such as digestive dis-orders, menstrual imbalance\nand urinary disturbance.\nHomeopathy is essentially fighting fire with fire.\nIt was first discovered by\nDr. Hahnemann, who was\ndistressed by the barbaric\nmedical methods of his time\n(bleeding, purging, and leech-es). He observed that the cinchona bark, which was then\nbeing used to treat malaria,\nhad toxicological effects if\ngiven to a healthy person.\nThe bark often produced\nattacks of fever, very similar to the malaria fever. But\nwhen small doses of the bark\nwere administered to malaria\npatients, the malaria fevers\nwere reduced. Hahnemann\ndeduced that infinitesimal\ndoses of substances which\nwould cause symptoms in a\nhealthy person were capable\nof curing similar symptoms\nin a sick person.\nTiny doses of plant, animal\normineralextractsaresoaked\nin alcohol, diluted and shaken vigorously. The patient is\nthen advised on dosage. The\nmore a substance is diluted,\nthe stronger its therapeutic\neffect and potency is thought\nto be. No one knows exactly\nhow homeopathy works, but\nsome studies have shown that\nextremely diluted amounts of\npoisons like arsenic and lead\ncan help remove the actual\npoison from the cells and\nreduce its harmful effects.\nIn a famous, but controversial study, the French professor Jacques Beneviste\nclaimed to show that even\nwhen a substance is so diluted that it can no longer be\ndetected, it can still somehow\ninfluence living cells. In a\nlater study he found that this\neffect only occurs if the substance has been vigorously\nshaken and not if it has been\nfrozen or overheated. Other\nrecent studies suggest that\nwater may be able to carry\na \u2018memory\u2019 of the original\nsubstance. Homeopathy has\nbeen shown to be effective\nin the treatment of hay fever,\nasthma, skin disease, colds\nand flu, high blood pressure,\nwhooping cough, insomnia,\nirritable bowel and depres-sion.\nEvery ancient civilisation\nhas used plants for healing\npurposes, and herbal medicine is probably the most\nancient form of medicine in\nthe world. Around three quarters of the world\u2019s population,\nespecially those in developing countries, rely on herbal\nmedicine - and almost a quarter of all modern prescription\ndrugs, are derived from plant\nsources, aspirin from willow\nbark, for example. Recently,\nit was found that green tea\nis particularly potent in fighting cancer, and work is being\ndone to extract the particular\nchemical agent responsible.\nThe stems, leaves, flowers,\nroots, bark, berries, fruits and\nseeds of plants can be used to\nmake a medicine. The medicinal part of the plant is harvested or extracted and then\neither dried for use in teas or\nmade into ointments, pow-ders, pills, capsules, lozenges\nor liquid tinctures. Different\nherbs have been shown to\nbe useful for a wide variety\nof conditions, for example,\nechinacea and goldenseal are\nknown to boost the immune\nsystem and garlic is used by\nmany individuals as a protection against atherosclerosis,\ncoronary thrombosis, stroke\nand even some types of can-cer.\nWith more and more people\ntaking an interest in their own\nhealth, complementary therapies will continue to become\nincreasingly popular. As well\nas other benefits, it\u2019s also just\nfar easier to purchase a box\nof echinacea tea than try and\nhaggle some antibiotics from\nthe pharmacist (not that I\u2019ve\ntried).\nEven trained medics are\nslowly taking an interest.\nPsychiatrists are using hyp-notherapy, anaesthesiolo-gists are getting help from\nacupuncture and physiotherapists are using acupres-sure and reflexology. There\nare so many aspects of our\nnature that modern medicine\nignores (particularly non\nphysiological effects), that\nit seems inevitable that the\ntide will turn towards holistic\nhealth.\nNatural therapy making a comeback\nWith growing public anger both here and in the US at the practices of pharmeceutical\ncompanies, Anushri Patel explains the benefits of alternative complementary therapy\n\u201cMost complementary\ntherapies are based on\nthe idea that the body\nhas a natural ability to\ntreat any disease... so\ntreatments often aim to\nstimulate this natural\nhealing ability\u201d\n\u201cGlaxoSmithKline\u2019s\nshares have plummeted\n12% this year following\na lawsuit... claiming\nthey had concealed\ninformation\u201d\nAcupuncture needles are replacing syringes in the treatment of a wide range of diseases\nAncient medicine focuses on keeping the body at one with\nits environment to promote an overall sense of wellbeing\n\u201cAs well as other\nbenefits, it\u2019s just also\nfar easier to purchase\na box of echinacea tea\nthan try to haggle some\nantibiotics from the\npharmacist\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Impossible? We\u2019ll see\nIt puzzled the Greeks, Einstein couldn\u2019t do it, but maybe William Gates stands a chance\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 18 November 2004\n26\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nContrary to the seemingly popular\nand \u2013 lets face it \u2013 egotistical belief\nthat science has no boundaries, no\nfrontiers which the human race\ncan never cross, it appears that\nthere are inevitable gaps in our\nknowledge. From perpetual motion\nto unprovable theories such as why\nwe cannot travel at the speed of light\nand our inability to categorically\npredict the weather. AK Dewdney\ninvestigates these insurmountable\nbarriers in his most recent book,\nBeyond Reason, mathematically\nand physically arguing their impos-sibility.\nOver the course of scientific his-tory, there have been certain problems that have been encountered\nby scientists of all backgrounds and\nfrom all nations, and they have been\ndefeated. The Ancient Greeks, for\nexample, tried to create a cube from\na circle drawn on a sheet of paper,\nthe cube having exactly the same\nsurface area as the circle, whilst\nlimiting themselves to.compasses\nand a ruler.. This issue has been\nstudied by thousands of scientists\nwho tackled the problem, believing\nit a means by which they can win\nuniversal acclaim, and yet each of\nthem failed. Inevitably, Dewdney\nargues, because of transcendental\nnumbers.\nI must admit to having absolutely\nno idea as to what transcendental numbers are. Dewdney does\nhis best to explain, but the gap in\nmy knowledge is still resolute. A\nstrength of Dewdney\u2019s, however,\nis his ability to very deliberately\ndisplay the method of his work-ing, and explain the mathematical ideas upon which his argument rests. Simply put, the area\nof a circle can never be exactly\ndetermined as it depends on pi,,\nan irrational and non constructa-ble number. Therefore the desired\ncube is impossible to create. Go\non \u2013 give it a go. Instant scientific\nacclaim awaits if you succeed.\nThe construction of the cube from\nthe circle is one of the eight \u201cgreat\nproblems that reveal the limits of\nscience\u201d investigated by Dewdney.\nThey are split into two categories:\n\u201cMath in the Cosmos\u201d and \u201cMath in\nthe Holos\u201d (where \u201ccosmos\u201d means\nthe physical universe in which we\nlive and \u201cholos\u201d means the entire\nuniverse of mathematics). The one\ninductive, the other deductive sci-ence, these problems are examples\nof why we, the human race, will\nnever be able to elevate ourselves\nbeyond the realm of impossibility.\nApparently not quite everything is\npossible.\nThe \u201ccosmos\u201d problems were the\nmore interesting, accessible and\nengaging. I found this to be the\ncase as I am not an expert in the\ndeeply complicated and sophisticated mathematical theorems\nwhich are more common in the\n\u201cholos\u201d problems. Nevertheless\nthe very notions which are brought\nto light are fascinating.\nTake perpetual motion, for exam-ple. This is probably the simplest\nof the problems to understand.\nPerpetual motion directly contradicts Newton\u2019s law that energy can\nneither be created nor destroyed.\nFor a perpetual motion machine\nto exist, it would have to create\nenergy to enable its chosen type\nof motion, whether it be a rotating\nwheel or the movement of electrons in a superconducting ring, to\ncontinue undiminished throughout\neternity.\nThis is, of course, impossible\nfor the simple reason that resistances to motion (such as friction)\nexist, and that energy cannot be\ncreated nor destroyed. Therefore\nthe perpetual motion machine will\neventually grind to a halt having\nexhausted its supply of energy and\nbeen overcome at last by friction.\nWhat I found most interesting\nabout perpetual motion, however,\nwas the various attempts by scientists over the years to create a\nmachine that succeeded in perpetual motion. Dewdney gives a detailed\naccount of many of the machines\nwhich were built, painstakingly, by\nscientists-come-fraudsters. Yet the\nvariety of the machines concocted\nis so impressive that it shows the\ningenuity of our species. The irony\nis that the ingenious designs were\nmerely hoaxes.\nThe holos problems were the\nmore mathematically dependent.\nSimplicity had to be sacrificed at\nthe alter of word-limit; no doubt it\nwould have taken Dewdney hundreds of pages to build up many\nof the arguments he makes form\nscratch. The most interesting holos\nproblem was why the long term\nbehaviour of systems such as the\nweather and planetary motion can\nnever be predicted by any mathematical law. The reason for the\nenjoyment of this section was the\nintroduction of Chaos Theory,\nsomething which I have met before\nin Jurassic Park (the book, not the\nfilm) through the teachings of Dr.\nMalcolm. \u201cA butterfly beating its\nwings somewhere in the Amazon\nrainforest today will make all the\ndifference in Holland in a week\u2019s\ntime between a heavy windstorm\nand a nice day.\u201d Sound familiar?\nThe holos questions should, per-haps, be reserved for those who\nactually know about such things\nas strange attractors and nonde-terministic algorithms (computing\nstudents, that\u2019s one for you). There\nis, however, an element of this book\nthat nags at the subconscious, posing questions which anyone can\nexamine and fret over, losing sleep\nand sanity.\nThe idea that poses many problems for me is: if there is an\nexception to every rule, then is\nthere an exception to that rule? In\nother words, if there is an exception to every rule, and that itself is\na rule, then there must be one rule\nto which there are no exceptions.\nBut that immediately contradicts\nthe first rule!\nOne could go around and around\nin circles such as this forever\nand still come no closer to the\nanswer. These brainteasers are\nones which only leave a bitter taste\nin the mouth, rather than make any\nsignificant difference to science.\nWhich came first, the chicken or\nthe egg?\nIn spite of these questions to\nwhich there seem to be no answer,\na more important idea of this book\nis one that it only poses acciden-tally. (in that it is not a motive of the\nbook itself). That idea is: what significance do these impossibilities\npresent to science? I have already\nmade the point that the pursuit of\nthe perpetual motion machine gave\nrise to a wealth of design activ-ity, the creation of machines which\nwere ingenious but not for the correct reason. Will science as a whole\ngo the same way?\nThe point may be made that we, as\nscientists, have not yet discovered\nall the theorems and mathematical principles which are relevant.\nIt could be that in four hundred\nyears time someone will be the\nnext Newton, or the next Einstein,\nand present a branch of mathemat-ics, hitherto undiscovered, which\nchanges the complexion of the universe and our understanding of it. A\nbranch of mathematics that forces\nback the frontiers and undermines\nthe foundations of the impossible\nbarriers. Why not? Such a concept\nmay be idealistic and essentially\nludicrous to us in the twenty-first\ncentury, but why should we be so\narrogant as to assume that everything that can be discovered has\nbeen?\nIn many ways we are still those\nAncient Greek mathematicians\nwho believed every number was\nrational. This was their belief, a\nbelief that brought them closer to\nthe divine ideal of perfection, which\ngave them the means by which they\ncould elevate themselves to the\nstatus of deities. Men being Gods.\nMaybe in the future we develop\nsome means of achieving this. Hey,\nif we can\u2019t scale these impossible\nbarriers, then why not go around\nthem?\nUltimately these barriers may,\non the one hand, be detrimental\nto science. We may as a civilisation see the top of Everest and\nbelieve we can go no higher. Our\nvoyage of scientific discovery is\nover, and our weaknesses exposed.\nA bitter end to the dreams that\nnothing is beyond our grasp. On\nthe other hand these barriers may\nbe motivating, driving us to overcome these obstacles by one way\nor another and, in doing so, achieve\nharmony of science, where all con-cepts, beliefs and ideals fall into the\narms of a single idea that unites all\naspects of our existence, and provide the answer to all the questions\nwe are asking. The achievement of\nthe Olympian ideal, the elevation\nfrom man to God. But then, since\nthis voyage of discovery has been\nthe motivation for thousands of\npeople over the years, reaching\nthe end would present the problem\nof \u2018where do we go from here?\u2019 A\nshift of focus to new frontiers and\nhorizons. Maybe there will be no\nend to our labour. Maybe Dewdney\nis wrong. Maybe we can climb the\nEverest of science, and leap from\nthe summit like Icarus, soaring\ntowards the sun.\nBeyond Reason\nA K Dewdney\n(Wiley)\n\u00a319.99, 240pp\nHHHHH\n\u201cThis is, of course,\nimpossible...\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we can\nclimb the Everest of\nScience...\u201d\nAlbert Einstein: baffled\n\n"

I\u2019m\nalso involved in IC football\naswell, with have friends in all\nkinds of other societies who\nuse various parts of the union\nbuildings. So my experience\nof the buildings and clubs\nneeds do expand beyond the\nConcert hall and a few store\ncupboards.\nDANIEL CARRIVICK\nThroughout six years at\nImperial I\u2019ve been heavily\ninvolved with various committees and other union activities both at club member, club\ncommittee and CSC levels.\nThis has given me a comprehensive understanding and\nbroad knowledge of union\nprocesses, only achieved\nthrough many years of hard\nwork. It would be a shame\nto waste all this experience\nand I feel after having gained\nso much, I would like to give\nsomething back to benefit the\nstudents.\nOn the House Committee\nI\u2019ll represent RCC clubs by\nfighting for essential maintenance and improvements\nto the store rooms in Beit\nQuad west basements and\nthe Laundry.\nMARTIN CHONG\nSo why do I want to be elected\nto House Committee? Well\nfirstly I won\u2019t hide the fact that\nI have been or are involved in\nsocieties that make a great\nuse of the Union premis-es. For example I am the\nDramSoc president. However\nthis has meant I have spent\nan unhealthy quantity of time\nin the Union and have seen\nthe problems and heard the\ncomplaints, particularly about\nstorage space. In addition I\nwill be in a very good position\nto understand the pros and\ncons of any proposals and not\njust let money get spent for\nspending\u2019s sake. So vote for\nme!\nRICHARD JORDAN\nI am standing for house committee because I am heavily\ninvolved in two organizations\n(Ents and Dramsoc) that\ndepend on the union building and fully appreciate how\nimportant all of the union\u2019s\npremises are to every active\nmember of ICU. I also have\na good working knowledge of\nthe union buildings.\nAs a committee member, I\nwill ensure that the premises\ncan perform all duties expected from them, be it clubs and\nsocieties or hire to external\norganizations which generates revenue for the union\nand therefore its student\nmembers.\nSEBASTIAN JUNEMANN\nHaving been a student here\nfor over two years now\nI\u2019ve got a good idea of the\nworkings of the Union and\nhow it affects the students.\nBeing on the committee of\nImperial\u2019s MTSoc has given\nme the experience of dealing\nwith the sort of politics which\nthe Union is famous for and\nimmersed me in the running\nof this organisation. Making\nthe insane choice of running\nfor Union Council and House\nCommittee is really down to\none thing. I want to see the\nUnion run the way we want it.\nVote for me and I\u2019ll represent\nyou. RON won\u2019t.\nANTON PIATEK\nI am standing for House\nCommittee because I believe\nthat the rooms and facilities\navailable from the union are\nthe most important thing to\nmany clubs. Imperial has a\nhuge number of clubs and\nsocieties and as a committee member of three clubs,\nI know what clubs have to\ngo through. I intend to make\nsure the students get what\nis best out of the facilities\navailable.\nDUNCAN RICHMOND\nYes I\u2019m in DramSoc. There\nI\u2019ve admitted it. BUT.\nAs a member of DramSoc, I\nspend a rather large proportion of my time working in\nand around the Union\u2019s facili-ties. Hence I believe I am well\nqualified to stand as a member of house committee. Of\nparticular concern to me, is\nthe issue of storage space for\nsociety equipment within the\nunion itself. This issue is not\nmerely confined to DramSoc\nbut is particularly important\nto many of the sports teams\nin the Union and I am keen to\nbring this matter for discus-sion. The state of the union\nbars and entertainment venues is also I believe a key\nissue.\nDAN LEHMANN\nWhy vote for me? I have lots\nof knowledge as to how the\nunion works. I have been a\nmember of House Committee\nbefore and importantly, am\nnot a member of DramSoc, so\nI do have other users of union\nfacilities at mind.\nI have also sat on Services\nCommittee for just over\n2 years, and know a great\ndeal about the minibuses, as\nwell as how this committee\nworks.\nLast year I observed on\nTrading Committee, in which\nI put together a paper on loyalty cards with another mem-ber. Vote for me, because I\nknow what to do.\nCity & Guilds\nCollege Union:\nHONORARY\nSECRETARY\n\u25cf There is 1 position available, and\nthere are 2 candidates plus the option\nto re-open nominations\nJASON CLARKE\nIf I become Honorary\nSecretary I would like to\nmake all the members of\nC&G aware of this membership as not enough people are\naware of what C&G does at\nthe moment. Apart from my\ntraditional responsibilities to\nthose in the office I would\nlike to extend the functionality of the C&G office to those\nvisitors who come seeking\ninformation, creating a more\nfriendly environment with\nmore information available to\nthose who need it. I intend to\nmake and carry out plans for\na successful summer ball to\nfollow on the success of this\nterms\u2019 fresher\u2019s ball.\nHELEN DAWSON\nI have been Year Rep,\nChairman of Fencing, a\nmember of CGCU Active and\nMechSoc, and currently the\nDept. Rep for Mechanical\nEngineering. This wealth of\nexperience makes me the perfect candidate for Honorary\nSecretary because I have\nalready built up trust with\nstudents across college and\nproved I am organised and\ncapable of handling responsibility as well as day-to-day\nduties such as meeting min-utes. I have a good relationship with the Exec already,\nunderstand the commitment\ninvolved, I will inculcate\nenthusiasm and help make\nthe CGCU a pro-active and\nsupportive part of the lives of\nall engineering students.\nPUBLICITY\nOFFICER\n\u25cf There is 1 position available, and\nthere is 1 candidate plus the option to\nre-open nominations\nDEREK WAN Most students do not need to\nknow about the internal operations of the Student Union,\nbut quite often they are not as\ninvolved as they could be. Part\nof this problem can be solved\nby having a Publicity Officer\nserve as the first contact for\nstudents. The officer must\nlisten to the thoughts of the\nstudents, answer their ques-tions, pass on their queries\nas well as to deliver updates\non the ongoing events of the\nUnion. In addition, the Officer\nshould actively seek feedback\nfrom the students to find and\ntackle issues which can be\nworked on. I believe that I\nhave the necessary skills and\nexperience, as well as the\ncommitment to serve as a\nsuccessful Publicity Officer.\nFaculty of\nPhysical Sciences\n\n"

This included three\nwomen\u2019s crews, who, along\nwith the men, raced the Head\ncourse from Chiswick Bridge\nto Putney Pier between 10am\nand midday last Saturday. 550\ncrews from around the world\ntook part, with a mixture of\nOlympic, international, club\nand academic (both school\nand university level) rowers\ncompeting over the four mile\ntime trial.\nImperial\u2019s top boat, a Senior\n1 quad, had the audacious\nhonour (or outrageous misfortune as some may see it)\nto set off 13th, but finished\nthird in their category behind\nMolesey and London in a time\nof 19 minutes 26.94 seconds.\nThe Senior 2 coxless four\nwere beaten into second\nplace by Henley Rowing Club\nby a margin of less than 7.5\nseconds with an overall time\nof 19min 46.26sec.\nThere was a similar story in\nthe Senior 2 coxed four event,\nwhere Imperial were once\nagain forced into the second\nslot, this time by Isis (Oxford\nUniversity\u2019s official boat club)\nin a time of 20min 18.03sec.\nThe women\u2019s Senior 2 quad\nperformed well, finishing\n7th in their category behind\nsome very stiff competition\nin the form of ex-Olympians\nand international level row-ers. The other two women\u2019s\ncrews performed admirably\nin the Senior 3 coxed fours,\ncoming 10th and 11th overall with barely ten seconds\nbetween them.\nIn what is becoming a\nfamiliar theme for this race,\nthe curse of the Fours Head\nstruck again, this time in the\nSenior 3 coxed four category\nwhere Imperial came second\nbehind Oxford Brooks in a\ntime of 20min 40.97sec.\nIt just goes to prove the old\nidiom \u201cbad things come in\nthrees\u201d. Regardless, all the\ncrews performed well, with\na few 10th and 11th places\nfurther down the table, all the\nmore impressive when you\nconsider that the categories\ncan contain 60+ crews.\nImperial College School\nof Medicine Boat Club also\nentered three boats in the\ncompetition, with their first\nmen\u2019s boat coming 23rd in the\nSenior 3 coxed fours event\nand, coincidentally, the women\u2019s crew placing 23rd in the\nfemale equivalent.\nSaturday 13 November sees\ntheImperialCollegeBoatClub\nheading down to Cambridge\nfor our novice squad\u2019s first\nrace at the Cambridge Winter\nHead.

The only move\nof note was a Badger run and\nblaze over the bar onto the\nhockey pitch, but everyone\nwas playing solidly enough.\nDefensively, Joey Mac slotted comfortably into the\nWang\u2019s boots, and Pat \u2018Beef\u2019\nFarr was solid as ever. Bucks\ndidn\u2019t take advantage of the\nconditions, and the only work\nfor keeper Von Orfordhausen\nwere a couple of free kicks\nstraight at him. Nil-nil at half\ntime.\nAfter a few stern words from\ncaptain Badger, Imperial set\nabout trying to dominate the\nsecond half and get the win\nthat would propel us to the\ntop. The wind seemed to die\na bit, but we still had the\nconditions, and started to put\ntogether some good moves.\nA few corners were won and\nnot utilised, and Badger went\nclose with a shot from dis-tance.\nBucks were still a threat\ngoing forward and won more\nfree kicks around the box, but\nthe defence stood firm and\ndidn\u2019t wilt. As time wore on,\nBucks lost more and more\ndiscipline, and holes started\nto appear in their defence.\nIt was through one of these\nholes that JR threaded a\nsublime pass into the path\nof Leigh, on loan from the\nSeconds, at the right corner\nof the box.\nLeigh lined up to spank the\nball across the keeper, but\ninstead succeeded only in\nspanking it straight at Badger\non the penalty spot. The skipper seemed to catch the ball,\nput it down, then pass it past\nthe \u2018keeper who was out of\nposition trying to narrow the\nangle from Leigh. With the\nBucks players livid at the goal\nbeing allowed to stand, the\nImperial boys celebrated.\nDAL came on for Spanish\nfunboi Benji, and Imperial set\nabout defending their lead.\nBucks piled on the pres-sure, with more freekicks\naround the box, and Von\nOrfordhausen was nailed in\nthe face by their number 10\nas he tried to scoop up the\nball following a corner. In\nthe end, that was the closest\nBucks came to scoring, and\nImperial were 1-0 victors, taking them to the top of their\nBUSA group.\nFirsts take charge\nin BUSA\nFOOTBALL\n\n"

Well what we have\nhere is a little bit of history\nrepeating. Dedicated readers\nof these match reports will\nbe starting to see a pattern\nin their content. So, I\u2019ve said\nit before, but I\u2019ll say it again\n\u2013 what happened? We really\nwere the stronger team and\ndid not deserve this defeat.\nThe problem appears to lie\nwithin the first 20 minutes\nof the game, our \u2018waking up\ntime\u2019. For those of you who\nare not familiar, \u2018waking up\ntime\u2019 is the period during\nwhich we have to shake off\nthe morning of journal reading and tutorial sheets and\ntransform ourselves into the\nhighly motivated athletes\nwe truly are. Unfortunately,\non more than one occasion\nthis term, the opposition has\ntaken full advantage of our\nfirst-half haze and sneaked a\ncouple of goals in. And this\nwas exactly what happened in\nthe Portsmouth game.\nIn the first half, Portsmouth\nscored two goals, but enough\nabout them already, so I\u2019ll\nmove swiftly on to the second\nhalf.\nImperial dominated the\npitch and there was little\nplay outside Portsmouth\u2019s\nhalf. Tyson, out for blood,\npushed forward with force\nand proved to be a brick\nwall that the Portsmouth\nattack failed to penetrate.\nThe defence, including man\nof the match Yoda, became\nhonorary midfielders as the\nonslaught in the \u201cD\u201d contin-ued. Around this time, the\nPortsmouth goalkeeper (or\nmaybe a higher force that\nfelt the need to punish us)\ndisgracefully began to move\nthe goalposts, and continued\nto do so for the remainder\nof the match, proven by the\nfact that all shots on said goal\nwere just a little too wide or a\nlittle too high. Imperial were,\ntherefore, left goalless.\nWe have now played all of\nthe teams in our league, and\nalthough only one victory\nhas been claimed, we know\neach team (maybe with the\nexception of St Mary\u2019s) is\nbeatable.\nSo the warm-up is over,\nbring on round two. The ladies\nare on the warpath, hungry\nfor goal pie, out for revenge.\nBUSA Hockey South Eastern\nConference Women\u2019s 1A (bit\nof a mouthful) beware.\nHOCKEY\nDeIViant hockey continues\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 0\nGKT Men\u2019s 2nd 3\nBy Richard Kirk\nand Atul Rana\nOnce upon a cold November\nday, 13 intrepid adventures,\nalso known as the almighty\ndeIViants, made their way\nto the fortress Harlington.\nDespite starting their season a month late and being\nthrashed by Imperial Medics\nThirds the week before,\nspirits in the deIViant camp\nwere high. After all, we now\nhad a complete team and\nwere supposedly playing\n\u2018serious\u2019 league hockey.\nAfter some dynamic \u201cjumping around like skippy the\nbush kangaroo on caeffine\u201d\nstretching, we began our fight\nagainst GKT Seconds, who\nhad some suspicious characters from last year\u2019s GKT\nthird team.\nSadly, unlike last year\u2019s\nresults, this game did not go\nin our favour. The first half\nstarted promisingly but soon\ndeteriorated into fully-fledged\nmadness and fiasco with our\namazing 10-0-0 and 0-0-10 for-mations. Our shameful penalty corner attack also went\ninto the abyss of infinity and\ndark matter that was our own\nhalf!\nTo top that, Lady Luck was\nnot on our side either, as GKT\ncunningly got two deflections\nin and we gave penalties away\nin true deIViant fashion. By\nhalf time it was 3-0. Having\nhad \u2018that\u2019 loud Jack git yelling at us for a full 35 minutes,\nwe now meant business. We\nfought back with all our might\nand started to attack in the\nsecond half, pissing off Jack\nand his pack as much as pos-sible.\nSome spectacular saves\nfrom our new \u2018keeper Doug\nfrom the eight short corners\nthat we faced, together with\nfine umpiring from the ladies,\nkept us in the game and our\nspirits alive. Special mention\nalso goes to Tight Lips, who\nmade a guest appearance for\nhis old team. He shall never\nforget his deIViant roots.\nFollowing our match, several players got even more\nhockey, making cameo\nappearances for the Thirds.\nOnce again our goalkeeper\n\u2018What do you call a man with\na spade on his head\u2019 showed\nthe skills he gained in his previous life as goalkeeper and\nwicketkeeper as the Thirds\ntook a mighty drubbing too.\nOnly the hardcore few\nmade it to the Union later, and\nafter some deIViant dancing\nour \u2018keeper showed that not\nonly is he good at saving but\nhe can score pretty finely\ntoo!\nAll in all, having come back\nfrom our last 9-0 drubbing,\nthe latest 3-0 scoreline is a\nbig improvement. We\u2019ll be\nback again to deliver deIViant\nwrath, so watch this space.\nHOCKEY\nBunch of deIViants: Imperial\u2019s fourth men\u2019s hockey team\nHistory repeats INTERHALL\nFOOTBALL\nSUNDAY 7 NOVEMBER\nBeit Walkover1\nUnion 0\nB Sunley & W Jackson 3\nSelkirk & Tizard 3\nClayponds 6\nPembridge 2\nFisher 1\nFalmouth Keogh 3\nGarden & Weeks 1\nLinstead 3\nSouthwell 1\nWilson 3\nSUNDAY 14 NOVEMBER\nBeit 2\nClayponds 7\nFalmouth Keogh 1\nWilson 0\nFisher Walkover1\nUnion 0\nLinstead 2\nB Sunley & W Jackson 2\nPembridge 0\nGarden & Weeks 3\nSelkirk & Tizard 2\nSouthwell 0\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 18 November 2004\n4\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAngry seagulls, Proposition 71, Columbo\nThe news this week: man\nsacked because he was too\nfat to get through the security\nturnstiles at work. Student\ninjured as seagull tries to\nsteal her sandwich. And final-ly, German woman caused\n\u00a315,000 of damage when she\ntried to eat a bowl of muesli\nwhile driving her car.\nBush\u2019s election victory was\na few weeks ago now, but it\nwas just as absurd as any of\nthe stories mentioned above.\nIts effects are already becoming apparent, especially within\nthe scientific community.\nScientists wanted Kerry\nto win. Not only was the\nDemocratic candidate in\nfavour of all-out stem cell\nresearch, but he was also\nmore in tune with scientists\nwhen it came to other issues\nsuch as environmental policy\nand science funding. Kerry\nwas the candidate for science\n(see Felix 1300).\nSo what are scientists planning to do in the aftermath\nof such a disastrous turn of\nevents?\nCalifornians have just\npassed Proposition 71, a $3\nbillion funding measure that\nwill put the state at the forefront of stem cell research. It\nwon 59% of the vote and was\nshown to be popular across\nall ages, races and incomes,\naccording to an exit poll conducted for the Associated\nPress.\nThis vote could possibly\nmean a \u2018gold rush\u2019 of scientists from across America\nand the world to the Golden\nState. To stem this flow, other\nenlightened states such as\nNew Jersey, Massachusetts\nand New York should be quick\nto raise money for state-led\nresearch.\nSo not only has Bush polarised his country and the world\nwith his medieval foreign pol-icy, he has now polarised science within the United States.\nThis polarisation is perhaps a\nsymptomoftheculturalunder-current, the struggle between\nthe forces of enlightenment\nand dogmatic religion.\nThis week in Science, we\nhave a feature article on the\nbenefits and increasing popularity of alternative medi-cines. Anushri Patel looks at\nnatural therapy and describes\nhow her brother successfully treated a verrucca with\nbanana peel. We also have\na story about \u2018ethnic drugs\u2019,\nanother controversial story to\nemerge from the USA, where\nscientists are targetting drugs\nat ethnic groups. Rosie Taylor,\nwho happens to be our resident dietician, will be placing\nthis issue under the spotlight.\nAlso did you know that Lt\nColumbo\u2019s character was\nbased on that of Porfiry\nPetrovic in Dostoyevsky\u2019s\nCrime and Punishment?\nWhat a quality piece of trivia.\nA new drug, BiDil, is expected\nto be launched onto US markets next year, when it will\nbe prescribable for AfricanAmericans only.\nResults from clinical trials of the drug to treat heart\nfailure in African-Americans\nhave shown that survival\nrates increased by 43% when\nthe new drug was used in\naddition to the conventional treatment. The 18 month\nmulti-centred RCT, published\nin the New England Journal\nof Medicine last week,\nwhich enrolled 1050 AfricanAmerican patients with heart\nfailure, was stopped early\nbecause the results were so\ncompelling. Previous trials of\nthe drug using a mixed population sample showed disappointing results.\nThe research has sparked\ncontroversy, not because of\nthe impressive efficacy of the\ntreatment, but due to concerns that the researchers\nhave oversimplified the concept of \u2018race\u2019 without a real\nunderstanding of the genetic\nbasis for the medicine. There\nis a consensus among leading scientists that \u2018race\u2019 is a\nweak substitute for the various genetic and non-genetic\nfactors that influence health\nstatus.\nIt has been accepted for\nsome time that certain ethnic groups are more prone\nto some diseases than oth-ers. Heart failure, or end-stage cardiovascular disease,\naffects around five million\nAmericans, but AfricanAmericans suffer dispropor-tionately; they are affected\nby heart failure at a greater\nrate than that of the non-African-American population,\nand they present with and die\nfrom the disease at an earlier\nage.\nThe increased efficacy of\nBiDil in African-Americans is\nthought to result from genetic\ndifferences in the processing\nof nitric oxide in the body,\nlow blood levels of which\ncontribute to heart disease.\nHowever, geneticists argue\nthat the manufacturers of\nBiDil have neither carried out\npharmacogenetic evaluation,\nneeded to determine if genetic factors explain the drug\u2019s\nenhanced effectiveness in\nAfrican-Americans, nor have\nthey properly excluded the\ninfluence of subtle environmental factors.\nInstead, BiDil is being\nmarketed as a drug to suit\nan entire \u2018race.\u2019 However,\nAfrican-Americans do not\nshare a common ancestry\nand are genetically far more\nnuanced and variable than is\nreflected in just skin coloura-tion. Genetic variation among\ndifferent populations is a con-tinuum, rather than discrete,\nnonoverlapping entities and\nthere is therefore \u201clikely to be\nhuge variation in how African\nAmericans will respond to the\ndrug\u201d says leading geneticist\nProfessor David Goldstein\nfrom University College\nLondon.\nBiDil may be a little premature but the Human Genome\nProject, once completed,\ncould define a concept of race\nthat is scientifically credible\nand useful. With more data, a\nbetter understanding of individual genetic variation could\nbe achieved and the resulting\nknowledge could be important in helping to illuminate\nthe race issue. Geneticists\nfeel that information from the\nhuman genome project could\neventually be used to assist\ndoctors in streamlining the\nsearch for the right diagnosis\nfor a set of symptoms, and\nthen allow the use of drugs\ntailored to a particular patient\ngroup.\nHowever, concerns have\nbeen voiced regarding the\npossibility of research into\ngenetic variation impacting\nnegatively on society. There\nare worries that data showing genetic variation between\ngroups could be oversimplified and used by racists as\n\u2018evidence\u2019 for the superiority of a particular group of\npeople.\nOthers have voiced concerns that poorer populations\ncould be neglected in drug\ndevelopment, whereby companies developing drugs for\nspecific ethnic groups create\n\u201corphan genotypes\u201d \u2013 genetic\ngroups not large or profitable\nenough to conduct work on.\nAdvances in understanding\nthe genetics of richer populations could then lead to an\nexacerbation of disparities\nin the quality of health care\namong different racial or ethnic groups.\nA potential solution has\nbeen employed in the USA,\nwhere regulation ensures\nthat minority groups, that\nhave been traditionally underrepresented in clinical and\nbiomedical studies, are over-sampled in any government\nfunded genetic research, so\nthat significant results can\nbe recorded. However, such\nregulations do not exist in\nEurope.\nIt is likely that advances\nin genomic medicine will\nexacerbate health disparities unless explicit efforts are\nmade to ensure that future\nresearch and treatments are\ninclusive.\nEthnic drugs: sensible treatment or racist ideology?\nAs scientists in the US plan to market a new \u2018ethnic drug\u2019 for African-Americans,\nRosie Taylor considers whether science is in danger of reinforcing social barriers.\nAre ethno-centric drugs the wave of the future or just an example of bad science?\nYOUR SCIENCE VIEWS\ntell Felix what you think\nIn the title to the article on MRSA\n(last week)... it said that hospitals are\n\u2018deathtraps for the sick\u2019.

Historically, it marks\nthe day when the Guilds of\nLondon celebrate their prosperity and the Lord Mayor\nparades in a flamboyant gold\ncarriage through the heart\nof London\u2019s City district.\nNowadays it is just as colourful and frenetic, and includes\nbands, floats, processions,\nmilitary parades, a fair in\nPaternoster Square and fireworks on the River Thames.\nThe procession dates back\nalmost 800 years and has\nmarched through the Black\nDeath (1347) and the Blitz\n(1945). The Lord Mayor travels from his offices at Mansion\nHouse to the Queen\u2019s Bench\nto pledge his allegiance\nto the Crown, just as Dick\nWhittington did for the first\ntime in 1397.\nThe City and Guilds College\nUnion (CGCU), the Faculty\nUnion representing Imperial\nCollege\u2019s 4000 engineers, has\nparticipated in the show over\nseveral decades.

St Bart\u2019s, meanwhile,\ndid nothing to threaten, while\nrelentless Imperial pressure\nbegan to present opportunities from corners and open\nplay.\nBerks and Wright combined on the half hour to feed\nNedved (seriously), who baffled the St Bart\u2019s centre back\nwith a neat turn inside the\nbox before being obstructed.\nWith the Mallorcan at an altitude of 80ft, his feet behind his\nneck and crying \u201ceghhh!\u201d, the\npenalty was swiftly awarded.\nAfter reflecting on a season of uncompensated penalty box assaults, Wright then\ntook the time to place the\ngiant Art Attack set square\nprop (supplied by Imperial\ndefender and actual Neil\nBuchanan stunt-double,\nThomas Gray) against his\nfoot and map the direction\nof the spot kick straight into\nthe \u2018keeper\u2019s hands. Imperial\nFirsts still searched for an\nopener...\nThe breakthrough came\nquite deservedly on the half\nhour mark; a right wing cross\nfound its way to Sugito who\nslotted home coolly from the\nback stick. One-nil Imperial.\nA similar situation arose\njust minutes later, only this\ntime an unmarked Sugito\nblazed over from McMahonlike proximity to the goal.\nHalf-time came, and although\nfrustrated at a mere one goal\nadvantage, Imperial had\nrecorded possibly their most\nimpressive half of football all\nseason.\nEager to maintain their\nexcellent work rate, Imperial\nstarted freshly with some\nearly spells of possession. Yet\nthey lacked the movement\nand incision of their first half\ndisplay and went noticeably\n\u2018off the boil\u2019 for a quarter-hour\nspell. St Bart\u2019s were dogged\nin defence but offered little\nin the way of creativity, while\nImperial\u2019s sloppy execution\nshowed signs that their first\nhalf exuberance was perhaps\ntaking its toll.\nThe home side rallied halfway through the second half,\nand a succession of dead ball\nsituations finally paid dividends through Farr\u2019s header\nfrom a dangerous Elhalhuli\ncorner. With the comfort\nof a two goal cushion, and\nthe destination of the three\npoints never really in doubt,\nWright added a third with a\nneat finish from Joe\u2019s centre after tidy work down the\nright. Job done for Imperial,\nand a period of easy possession saw the game out with\na clean sheet and convincing\nresult, reward indeed for a\ndominant performance over\nweaker opponents.\nHighlight of the match\nbelonged to the Northern\ndisco feet of one Joseph\nMcMahon, who pulled out\nan outrageous 360 degree\nmega-Cruyff straight from\nMichael Flatley\u2019s locker.\n\u201cFlatley my dear, I don\u2019t\nRiverdance\u201d.\nImperial batter Barts\nFOOTBALL\nCity & Guilds 78\nThaiSoc 12\nBy Andrew Towers\nOn an unusually warm\nHallowe\u2019en weekend, the\nmost glamorous team at\nImperial College took to the\nfield for their first match of\nthe season in the aftermath\nof a \u201csuccessful\u201d pub golf session a couple of weeks ago.\nA ThaiSoc team that had\npreviously overturned the\nImperial Thirds team was the\nopposition, not to be taken\nlightly. The 22 man C&G\nsquad contained an eclectic\nmixture of first to fourth team\nplayers, all with one thing in\ncommon \u2013 the ability to bring\ngrotesque amounts of glamour to a rugby pitch.\nC&G stamped their authority on the game within minutes of the start, with Stu \u201cthe\nbeast\u201d East touching down\nafter some heinous try avoidance from Les Jon Spencer,\nour flying French fly-half.\nThe tries kept on com-ing, with Le Douge Higgins,\nLes Jon, and Jim \u201cmaster\nlungemeister\u201d Pedder all\ntaking advantage of a disorganised ThaiSoc defence. A\nlapse in concentration and\nsome poor tackling allowed\nthe ThaiSoc inside centre\nto crash through from short\nrange to open their scoring.\nOutwardly frustrated by this,\nC&G responded with another\nthree tries before half time,\ncourtesy of some great team-play and pornstar moves from\nLes Jon (still drunk) and captain Andy \u2018Teflon\u2019 Towers.\nHalf time score: 47-7.\nIn the second half, captain\nTowers called for improved\ndefence, bigger tackles and\nof course, more glamour. The\nteam responded instantly\nwith substitute centre and\nrevelation Alex Davis kindly\nshowing his opposite number\nwhere the floor was. The\nchampagne rugby continued\nto flow, with tries from Mark\n\u201cporno\u201d Wills, Pedder and\nLe Douge for a second time\neach, fresher and tour veteran Charlie (mini Nathan)\nDavidson, and Dom Chan.\nOther highlights included\nan overzealous spear tackle\nby Porno Wills, almost decapitating his unfortunate victim\nin the quest for the Biggest\nHit award. It was ThaiSoc\nwho had the last word though,\nwith a dubious chip and chase\ntry, duly awarded by a somewhat sympathetic referee.\nFinal score: 78-12.\nWith spectacular performances from all members of\nthe squad, and particularly by\nthe newcomers and freshers,\npicking a man of the match\nbecame the hardest moment\nof the day. The honour went\nto fresher and debutant Alex\nDavis for some silky skills at\ncentre.\nC&G Rugby\ntoo hot to\nhandle\nRUGBY\nNo forwards... no problem\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 35\nKing\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st 0\nBy Scotch\nThe Virgins have had a difficult start to the season, facing\nour two hardest opponents\nin BUSA in the two opening\nweeks, so we were hoping for\nbetter in our first ULU league\nmatch.\nFor the first time ever,\nwe had no forwards and a\nchanging room full of backs \u2013\nexcuse me? Are we still playing women\u2019s rugby? Some of\nus also had no pants, but I\nsuspect that wasn\u2019t a first!\nSo poor Udders had to be\nforcibly held down and made\nto put on the number three\nshirt, and off we went. Except\nthe opposition hadn\u2019t shown\nup yet, so we stood about and\ndrank Red Bull for a bit.\nBy the time the game kicked\noff, there was only time for\n70 minutes of rugby, but we\nmade the most of it.\nWithin the first five minutes,\nSpandex had taken a quick\ntap penalty and ploughed over\nthe line with three ineffectual\nKing\u2019s backs hanging off of\nher shiny white shorts. This\nset the tone for the rest of\nthe match, the forwards hogging the ball to great effect\nand carrying it up the pitch.\nOur second try was a similar affair, with the forwards\nmauling the ball over the line\nand Spandex suddenly popping out the other side of the\nruck to set the it down.\nWe then mauled the ball\nover the line again but the\nref decided it was held up\n\u2013 pesky refs, always spoiling\nmy fun. And then he had the\ncheek to disallow another try\nby Filthy. How rude.\nFilthy covered herself in\nglory again two minutes later,\nwhen our ball was turned over\non our 5m line and King\u2019s got\nthe ball to their wing, who had\nmade it to halfway and was\nclean through until Filthy\u2019s\nfantastic covering tackle.\nThe second half saw two\ntries from Joss, who picked\nup from the base of the scrum\nto crash over.\nWe made the most of our\nsuperiority in the scrum,\nwhere the King\u2019s front row\nwere struggling. Scotch took\na quick tap penalty and found\nher way through a dog\u2013leg\nto get clear for a fourth\nscore. Danger Mouse had\nspent the afternoon trying to\nwork blindside moves, which\nfinally paid off and allowed\nher through to score in the\ncorner, although she almost\ndropped the ball as she was\nso busy celebrating!\nKing\u2019s tried to catch us\nout with a quick restart,\nbut instead kicked the ball\nstraight down the throats of\nour forwards and into Felix\u2019s\nwaiting arms. We mauled it\n10m up the park until Kings\ncollapsed the maul. Scotch\npicked the ball up amid the\nconfusion, and the next\nbreakdown saw Udders take\nit on and power home from\nthe 22 for our final score.\nHonourable mentions\nmust also go to Bambi, who\nwas fearless on the wing as\nalways, although we didn\u2019t\nlike passing the ball right\nso poor Whiplash only saw\nthe ball twice all game! The\nbacks keep improving as\nthe weeks go by, and Ali had\nsome fantastic crash ball at\ninside centre.\nOur final special mention\nmust go to Alex Ferguson,\nwho dropped the C7G spanner on Dappy\u2019s foot, leaving\nher on crutches and compounding our forwards short-age. But then it was her silly\nfault anyway for gatecrashing\nthe Engineering Freshers\nBall.\nRUGBY\nHolloway Men\u2019s 4th 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 2\nBy Michael Nicholson\nWednesday was the biggest\nevent of the season for the\nfourths, the infamous Hammy\nTen pub crawl. Amazingly,\nthe date coincided with the\nHolloway away fixture, the\nbiggest and most difficult\ngame of the season.\nTop of league, undefeated,\nonly two goals conceded, and\nwith a full time manager,\nthere was no doubting that\nHolloway would be favourites\nfor this one. Imperial\u2019s task\nwas made all the more difficult when top-scorer Shwin\nwas ruled out with a knee\nligament injury, and Paul was\nstill struggling with an ankle\nknock. Oz was drafted in to\nplay on the left, and Chris\nParrot moved up front.\nIt was Holloway who\nstarted the brighter, with\ntheir midfield looking particularly strong, and Vanni had to\nmake a stunning tip over the\nbar to preserve the deadlock.\nImperial were having trouble keeping possession with\nmisplaced passes, poorly\nexecuted tackles and a lack\nof communication being very\nmuch the order of the day.\nAn injury to Holloway\u2019s left\nwinger prompted Captain\nVanni to rally the troops, telling us to play our game and\nkeep things simple. Obviously\nChris had been listening\nintently, and kept things nice\nand simple in the corner by\nperforming a perfectly executed rainbow kick. The team\nhowever did begin to dig in a\nlittle harder, and managed to\nget some sort of foothold in\nthe game.\nHolloway, however, got\nthemselves in front courtesy\nof a neat finish from their\ncentral midfielder, after the\nImperial backline had made\na complete pig\u2019s ear of a routine ball through the middle.\nInto the second half, it\nlooked like things would get\nworse with Holloway\u2019s constant attacking pressure akin\nto Vanni when he\u2019s on the pull\n\u2013 relentless and seemingly\nonly a matter of time until\nthey scored. Fortunately, they\nmissed a couple of gilt-edged\nchances: firstly Vanni made\na point blank save, tipping a\ngoal bound effort onto the bar,\nand then with Vanni caught\nout of position their striker\ntugged his short wide when\nhe should have done better.\nSuddenly with 20 minutes to\ngo Imperial found the belief\nwhich had been sadly lack-ing, and managed to create a\nchance for Jai. Their \u2018keeper,\nwho was slightly larger than\nyour average bungalow,\ncame off his line with surprising speed and managed\nto smother the well-struck\neffort. Still, the chances were\ncoming regularly now and\nImperial\u2019s defence began to\ndominate Holloway\u2019s now\nsole striker.\nEventually a corner from\nleft was met firmly by\nDemetris, leaping like the\npinkest of pink salmon, and\nthe ball looped into the top\ncorner despite the efforts of\nHolloway\u2019s man on the line.\nThe game was now wide\nopen and it was Imperial who\nseized the win with an opportunistic strike from Oz after\nDemetris had once again\nshown great perseverance\nand skill on the right. With all\nhands to the pump, Imperial\nsnuffed out the Holloway\nthreat and easily played out\nthe few remaining minutes\nfor probably the most significant win of the season.\nThe day was perfected by\nsome magnificent drunken\ndebauchery on the Hammy\nTen, the highlight of which\nwas Vanni proving true captain material by vomiting\nafter a whole two pints.\nFOOTBALL\nThe Imperial Virgins rugby team\n\n"

Like zombies, the\nlucky chosen few crawled\nup into the cockpit, happily\nnoted the lack of wind and\noptimistically suggested that\nwe leave at 5.30am instead.\nMate Dave was straight back\nin his sleeping bag, but the\nVantage crew were having\nnone of it and we set off into\nthe night.\nOn 30 October 2004, the\nImperial College Union Yacht\nClub left on our annual cross-channel mission. Two boats,\nVantage and Fandango, were\nchartered and 21 of us set\noff for Cherbourg in France\n(and yes, more than one passport was forgotten!) Store\ncupboards groaning with\nMorrison\u2019s finest junk food\nand plenty of beer, it seemed\nlike a great idea at the time\nto eat a Twix for breakfast.\nThose of us who spent much\nof the weekend lying flat on\nthe deck decorating the sides\nof the boat a less than pretty\ncolour soon regretted it.\nWith both boats well on their\nway, or so we thought, skipper\nMike received a desperate\ncall from skipper James P on\nFandango; they were still in\nthe marina with less than two\nhours\u2019 worth of fuel, which in\nthe light winds would not see\nthem to France. A quick scavenge yielded enough diesel\nto set off, but an hour behind\nVantage meant that against\nall odds the tortoise had a\nhead start on the hare!\nWe crossed the shipping\nlanes without mishap and\nfinally got the chance to do\nsome sailing. This was just\nas well because Fandango\u2019s\nproblems weren\u2019t over yet;\nthe engine spluttered to its\ndeath before they were even\npast the Isle of Wight, just\nwhentheskipperandhismate\nthought they deserved a quick\nkip below. Mate Dave has\nnever leapt out of his sleeping bag so fast! Unfortunately\nthis left Fandango reliant on\nsome decent wind to get to\nCherbourg and a goodwill tow\ninto the marina from its arch\nrival Vantage. But after the\nprevious weekend\u2019s gales,\nthe autumn sunshine and\nkeen wind was an extremely\nwelcome change and both\nboats enjoyed a glorious\ncruise interspersed with\nsome enthusiastic renditions\nof Bohemian Rhapsody and\nthe odd jig from our resident\nentertainer Jack.\nJust after 5pm, Cherbourg\nappeared on the horizon\nand the Vantage crew were\nlooking forward to a hearty\nFrench meal. But where\nwas Fandango? Two hours\nand a beautiful sunset later,\nFandango limped into sight\nheading for the leeward\nshore. We had all hands on\ndeck to get out the tow lines\nand fenders (and one unpopular camera). Following\nvarious fraught instructions,\nsome excellent skippering\nand under Jenny\u2019s naviga-tion, we finally made it into\nthe marina at 8.30pm local\ntime. Beers were the order\nof the day.\nBut there was no rest for\nthe wicked. Supplies, die-sel, broken engine, showers\nand dinner called. The girls\nembarked on a supermarket\nsweep ten-minute challenge\n(not aided by their pigeon\nFrench); members of the\nFandango crew went on a desperate mission for diesel; the\ntechnically minded got down\nto the dirty business of fixing\nFandango\u2019s engine; which left\ntwo champion French chefs\nslaving over dinner for 21 in\nthe galley.\nDinner was a merry affair\nwith everyone squeezed into\nVantage\u2019s main cabin for spaghetti bolognese and cheap\nFrench plonk, apart from\nJames Y who preferred his\n\u00a36.99 bottle of white spirit\n(oops, sorry, vodka) that came\nback to haunt him.\nA slightly later start on\nSunday courtesy of the\nclock change saw us heading into what looked like a\nstorm. Most of us slunk off\nback below deck for a good\nSunday lie-in and were woken\nup at lunchtime to beautiful\nsunshine and just in time to\nsee the dolphins swimming\naround Vantage. Meanwhile\non Fandango, broken heads\n(toilets) saw Dave, only\njust out of his sleeping bag,\ncaught out by an unexpected\ntack (thanks, Stefanos) taking a piss over the back over\nthe boat.\nThe race was really on\nas both boats took advantage of the good wind and\nsteamed back towards the\nIsle of Wight. Back in broadcast range of Ocean FM we\nenjoyed a good singsong,\nbasking in the sunshine and\nappreciating the cruising life.\nWith the sun going down fast,\nand temperatures rapidly\ndropping, spirits started to\nfail; we still had three hours\nof sailing against the tide to\nreach Gosport. Multiple layers of clothing and a dinner of\nPringles and Haribo restored\ncheer, just in time for a hair-raising return to Gosport\nplaying dodgems with ferries\nand tankers. Fireworks in the\ndistance didn\u2019t aid navigation\nbut after a fantastic, albeit\neventful, weekend, we made\nit back safely to the relief of\ntwo exhausted skippers and\ntheir crews.\nA fleeting visit to Cherbourg\nYACHT CLUB\nCrossing the channel to Cherbourg: Yacht Club chairman James spots the French coast\nDo you want thousands of readers to know all about your club or society?

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nFor the unlucky few who haven\u2019t\nheard about the antics of the\nBrighton-based Eighties Matchbox\nB-Line Disaster, here\u2019s a quick\nrecap. Lead singer Guy McKnight\ncries, dribbles and runs head first\ninto the speakers when performing live, and they got mainstream\nattention with their debut single,\nCelebrate Your Mother, about the\njoys of fornicating with your parents\n(\u201cIt\u2019s a dirty job but someone\u2019s got\nto do it well!\u201d he crooned), which\nwas followed up by the short spiky\nalbum Horse Of The Dog.\nThe Royal Society, their follow-up,\naims to send their goth-metal to a\nnew dimension, helped by Queens\nOf The Stone Age producer Chris\nGoss. Opening with the intense Rise\nOf The Eagles, it\u2019s a prime example\nof The Eighties Matchbox B-Line\nDisaster at their finest: menacing\nbass lines, quick riffs and surreal lyrics which are not too distant\nfrom a Leonard Cohen album. We\nhave Guy\u2019s awesome voice pelting\nout \u201cI wanna fly like an eagle / I\nwanna sing like Sinatra / I\u2019ve got a\ndate with destruction / I wanna love\nlike a mother!\u201d in his trademark\nbaritone, then switching to a high\npitched squeak for the chorus line,\n\u201cAll dressed up and ready to go!\u201d\nSurrealism and gloom is the order\nof the day here, with lyrics such as\n\u201cHere\u2019s you your skin, so pale and\nthin / Give me your skin for dancing in\u201d in the creepy I Could Be\nAn Angle, and the downright weird\n\u201cWhat do we do with puppy dog\u2019s\ntails? / What do we do with a bucket\nof snails? / What do we do with a\nboy like you? / We put them in a pot\nand throw them on a fire!\u201d on the\ngothic Puppy Dog Snails, which had\nme laughing like a loon when I first\nheard it.\nThe new production sheen can\nalso be felt, with Drunk On The\nBlood being an impressive Queens\nOf The Stone Age influenced mini-epic with two distinct parts, and\nthe bass-driven Mister Mental,\nwhich most people would know\nfrom Shaun Of The Dead. One of\nthe highlights of this process is the\ngloomy Temple Music, a surprisingly personal song of lost love, with\nthe haunting chorus \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve\nripped out your heart dear / I\u2019ve got\nto throw it away\u201d which is dripping\nwith atmosphere.\nDespite the band\u2019s strengths, the\nalbum in general suffers from a lack\nin diversity in other tracks. Some of\nthe guitar sections start to sound\nrepetitive and boring, recycling the\nsame riffs from before. Also, these\nsongs drag on too long, repeating choruses too many times and\nundermining the epic sound of the\nother songs.\nSo here\u2019s the crux: at 45 min-utes, it\u2019s just too long. Which is a\ngreat shame, because The Eighties\nMatchbox B-Line Disaster show\nsome great talent here for an atmospheric tune, but haven\u2019t managed to\ncreate a cohesive album, having too\nmuch filler in between the strong\ntracks. If they can learn to keep it\nleaner for next time, we could be\nlooking at one of the finest bands\naround today.\nMatthew Hartfield\nAppearances can be truly mislead-ing. I picked up From Shadows\nCame Darkness with half-hearted\npessimism, expecting, from the\nmonochrome cover and minimalist\npresentation, some sort of depressing but competent indie melancho-lia. I didn\u2019t expect an interesting,\nvaried and utterly surprising blend\nof classic rock and contemporary\nmetal, but that is exactly what I got.\nThe album kicks off with a simplistic and sweet classical piano track\nthat wouldn\u2019t sound out of place\nin either a HIM song or a Classic\nFM easy listening compilation, but\nit soon turns into something completely different. From the second\ntrack, Act of Sorrow, onwards,\nMendeed show off the metal credentials that have had them touring with the likes of Anthrax and\nMy Ruin. Marrying ambitious soaring guitars with speed drumming\nand desperate, hoarse screams and\ngrowls usually associated with the\nfar more extreme end of the musical spectrum, they create a blend of\nthe traditional and the outr\u00e9 that is\njust that bit more exciting than most\nof the generally available metal-lite\nout there. Not easy listening by any\nstretch of the imagination, it\u2019s still\ncompelling and intriguing; like ice\ncream laced with razor blades, you\ncan feel the danger but you just can\u2019t\nhelp yourself.\nIf it were indeed ice cream, razor-blade-laced or otherwise, the one\nthing you can be sure of is that it\nwouldn\u2019t be vanilla, even that really\nnice vanilla with the clotted cream.\nNot content with a highly skilled\nwinning formula, Mendeed scatter\nthe album with unexpected interludes \u2013 a spot of almost flamenco-esque acoustic guitar with floaty\nfemale vocals here, what sounds like\nchildren chanting in an unspecified\nAfrican language there, a hidden\ntrack that returns to the classical\ntheme of the intro, but with a much\nmore intense, brooding atmosphere\n\u2013 that make you prick up your ears\nwith curiosity. To switch metaphors,\nit\u2019s rather like eating Revels: you\u2019re\nnever quite sure what you\u2019re going\nto get, but you know it\u2019ll be good.\nExcept that Mendeed don\u2019t really\nhave an equivalent for the one flavour you always try to palm off onto\nsomeone else; it\u2019s all pretty damn\nfine.\nIn the interests of unbiased report-ing, it\u2019s probably best that I point out\nthat some sections of the album do\ntend to drag; in between the random\nbits of oddness, the music itself is\na little one-sided. Really, though,\nthat\u2019s splitting hairs when it\u2019s so\nbrilliantly executed: tight, coherent\nand relentlessly driven. Metal purists could demand some more integrity to the genre while those unacquainted with it could ask for a bit\nless obscurity, but all in all this is a\nfantastic crossover album that, at a\nmere 36 minutes, will leave you hungry for more. Like those teeny tiny\nindividual pots of Ben and Jerry\u2019s,\nbut with a lot more punch.\nAnna Novitzky\nPicture the scene. Four 30-some-things gather around their Ikea\ncoffee table after putting their 2.5\nchildren to bed. After discussing\nthe next people carrier they wish\nto buy, and celebrating the fact that\none of them has been promoted to\n\u201cexecutive-vice-sub-divisional-marketing-strategist\u201d, the subject turns\nto music. They suspiciously eye the\nDido CD lying on their aforementioned generic \u2018stylish\u2019 furniture,\nrecently, and hurriedly, removed\nfrom their in-car hi-fi. They read in\nthe latest Child Motivation Monthly\nthat exposing your child to violent\nTV actively suppresses their ruth-less-overachieving gland, and that\ndude from Buffy was in a Dido song\nor something. So, they ask, who do\nthey turn to next to provide their\nchildren with soothing drive-time\nmusic?\nIt could well be Feist. Oh my God,\nwhere to start. It\u2019s bland, it\u2019s annoyingly hushed, it\u2019s jazz for a generation devoid of soul and it\u2019s pretentious (there are songs in French!)\nPossibly worst of all, it thinks it\u2019s\nquirky. Compared to artists of a similar age producing gloriously eccentric solo semi-folk (see the brilliant\nDevendra Banhart, Regina Spektor,\nIron and Wine) it\u2019s about as quirky\nand interesting as a wall upon which\npaint dried 50 years ago.\nAnd the instrumentation! Just as I\nthought I would bite off my own ears\nif they didn\u2019t use drumsticks instead\nof brushes, I found I was begging\nfor their return as the percussion\nwas replaced with finger-clicks. And\nthat is pretty much the most interesting thing I can say about it. You\nmay wonder why there are no track\nnames stated here; you may wonder\nif I have only listened to it once. Oh\nno, I sat through it three times. Felix\nowes me a beer (I\u2019ve heard it, and I\nagree \u2013 Ed).\nWant a more quantifiable representation of its awfulness? Feist are\nsupporting Keane. That means in\ntheory they are not even as good as\nKeane. Go and buy this for someone\nyou don\u2019t like.\nJames Millen\nMotherloving, metal and tedium\nThe goth-punk Eighties Matchbox return with their new album, Mendeed impress despite\nthe cover, and Feist almost kills Felix with boredom\nEighties Matchbox B-Line\nDisaster\nThe Royal Society\nMCA\nHHHII\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nEighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster: their dragster of the same name, now sadly departed\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 18 November 2004 21\nMendeed\nFrom Shadows Came Darkness\nRising\nHHHHI\nFeist\nLet It Die\nPolydor\nIIIII\nMendeed: not your typical seaside band\n\n"

The traditional Friday night curry in\nShrewsbury was postponed\nto the early hours of Saturday\nmorning due to the poor\nplacement of Birmingham.\nNevertheless, when we got\nthere, we filled ourselves to\nbursting point and managed\nto make it to the hut in time\nfor a couple of hours\u2019 sleep\nbefore rising to the sound\nof birds cheeping in the\nSnowdonian wilderness.\nThe cooked breakfast only\ntook a few hours, and we were\nsoon on the road to find rocks\nand mountains to climb.\nOne group headed off\nto Tremadog for some top-rope and multi-pitch climbing whilst the rest of us set\noff for Snowdon. Half of the\nSnowdoneers went up Crib\nGoch and the others went up\nthe far scarier PYG track.\nThankfully, the Welsh weather gods were kind to us and\nwe all got to the summit safely and dry. The descent was\nslightly colder and wetter due\nto the presence of a cold, wet\nlake. The prize for the wettest\nT-shirt goes to\u2026\nAnyway, everyone made it\ndown safely and proceeded\nto the pub where we met up\nwith the triumphant climbers.\nDespite doubling their annual turnover in one evening,\nthe local publicans were as\nhostile as ever. Thanks must\ngo to club Welshman John\nwho tried his best to teach us\nthe Welsh national anthem.\nApologies must also go to\nclub Welshman John who we\nleft at the pub by mistake.\nSorry!\nOnce back at the hut, we\nhad a wholesome dinner\nand tucked into a few more\ndrinks. Some of us had a few\nmore. The more responsible\namongst us had a few more.\nThose less responsible took\nover from the more responsible and thanks must go to\nthem. Thanks.\nSunday morning was a bit of\na blur but we still managed to\nhave a fantastic day climbing\nat the Pinnacles. New routes\nwere scaled, bouldering problems solved and everyone\nseemed to enjoy themselves\ndespite their woolly heads.\nWe eventually set off for\nhome and all 31 of us made it\nback safely, if rather late, on\nSunday night.\nThanks to everyone who\nwent, especially the 17 fresh-ers who really got stuck in\nand made the weekend a\nsuccess. Hopefully you had a\ngood time and it\u2019d be great to\nsee you again.\nIf you would like more information about IMMC and our\nplans for the year, visit our\npage on the www.icsmsu.\ncom website.

Why\nnot? Great country, great food\nand brilliant people! But what\nhappens when the Spanish\ncome to London? There\u2019s so\nmuch to take in: the rain, fish\nand chips, sunset at half four\nin the evening, beans on toast,\ncockney rhyming slang and\nso on. These are just a few\nof the factors that contribute\nto the tremendous culture\nshock that we poor Spaniards\nget when we first arrive.\nTo be fair, it takes some\ngetting used to, and a feeling\nof homesickness is somewhat\nunavoidable when one stops\nand thinks of beautiful, sunny\nSpain. Fortunately, London\nis a great place and there\u2019s\nso much to do that this is\nnot a great problem, however\nevery now and then I have\nfound myself in the mood for\nsome good Sangria, dancing\na little Pachanga or eating\ndecent paella. Not necessarily all at the same time, but\nyou know what I mean!\nAnyhow, these and any\nother Spain-cravings that\nyou might have are what\nthe Spanish Soc is here for!\nWe want to bring a bit of the\nSpanish way of life to London,\nso that us Espa\u00f1oles will get a\nbit of home away from home,\nand everyone else can get a\ntaste of what being Spanish is\nall about.\nSo far this year, we\u2019ve had\na couple of really cool parties and meetings where\neveryone\u2019s had an excellent\ntime and even learnt a bit of\nSpanish (seriously, you drink\na bit and you\u2019re suddenly\nbilingual!)\nThe Day of the Dead party,\norganised with our mates\nfrom the LatAm soc, for\ninstance, was great! We hired\na club out and near enough\ntook over the place to organise a Hallowe\u2019en party, Latin\nstyle! That is with some san-grias here, some se\u00f1oritas\nthere, and a good time all\naround! I for one was out of\nmy tree and I wasn\u2019t the only\none \u2013 someone must have\nwoken up wearing a random\nsombrero!\nWe then organised another party last weekend. This\ntime, it was planned as a typical Spanish party, without the\nstereotypes, and it turned out\nto be a pretty random one!\nWe had a small bouncy castle\nthat proved to be a success\namongst the smokers, and a\nmysterious smoke machine\nthat actually popped out of\nnowhere for a short time\nand then left us, never to be\nseen again... spooky! Overall,\nthe result was a completely\ncrazy night, a whole bunch\nof newly acquainted couples\nand a good time in general.\nBut just in case that\u2019s not\nenough fiesta for you people,\nwe\u2019ll be organising a couple\nof new events soon.\nLook out for our upcoming\nboat party! This is a recurring\nevent, organised by a bunch\nof the mediterranean societies as well as the Latin people (we can\u2019t get enough of\n\u2018em). We\u2019ve hosted this event\nfor a couple of years now and\nit\u2019s always turned out to be a\nbig success and a good laugh.\nIf you want to know more,\nemail ignacio.quinones@ic.\nac.uk and I\u2019ll put you on the\nmailing list.\nOf course, we have good\nparties but we do organise\nother stuff! We\u2019ve been to a\ncouple of pubs and met up\nwith a few people who wanted to improve their language\nskills. So we\u2019ve made some\nnew friends in these little language sessions, but we\u2019re not\nalways that friendly! We\u2019re\nlooking forward to meeting\nour rivals in the upcoming\nfive-a-side world cup and\nwe won\u2019t be easy on you!\nSpeaking of football, coming\nup this Sunday is THE match:\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona,\nthe clash of the titans! We\u2019ll\nsee you in the pub for it; look\nout for the loud group!\nSPANISH SOCIETY\nSpanish agenda\nCompetitions\nSick of squabbling with your housemates over whose turn it is on the internet?\nIt can be a nightmare with a house-full trying to get online at the same time.\nBroadband for Students from BT is a brand new package which could be just\nthe answer \u2013 offering students a nine-month broadband contract* if they sign\nup before November 30th.\nThe new package is designed specially around your student year and is\navailable with the BT Wireless Network**.

BP claims 80%\nproved assets but if the SEC\n(Securities and Exchange\nCommission) were to investigate this, van der Veer is\nsmugly confident that the\nfigure would need to be re-adjusted. In fact, if all the\nmajor oil companies agree to\nan external audit, rather than\ntrying to dodge the inevitable forced investigation, an\nindustry-wide scandal could\nbe avoided.\nSpitzer strikes (again!)\nShare prices of three major\ninsurers fell by an average of\n4% as Eliot Spitzer, the New\nYork attorney general, broadened his investigation into\nMetLife, UnumProvident and\nPrudential Financial.\nAs investigations continue\ninto Marsh\u2019s practices, fresh\naccusations of insurers paying illegal commissions to\nbrokersinexchangeforcorpo-rate business arise. Arguably\nthe largest insurer in the UK,\nLloyds TSB has urged insurers that use Lloyds to ensure\nthat procedures are in place\nto prevent anti-competitive\npractices.\nFurthermore, as a sign\nof the far-reaching effects\nof Spitzer\u2019s probe into this\nindustry, Zurich Financial\nsuspended many of its staff as\nit carried out internal audits\non affairs related to Marsh &\nMcLenna.\nHSBC v Citigroup\nHSBC officials in Korea are\nhoping to increase their market share in Asia by acquiring\na 50% stake of Korea First\nBank, thus putting HSBC\nin direct competition with\nCitigroup, the majority stake-holder of KorAm bank.\nIf successful, both banks\nwill be competing for retail\nbanking and credit services to\nsmall- and mid-cap firms. The\n50% stake that HSBC hopes\nto acquire by 2005 is currently\nheld by Newbridge Capital,\nthe US investment fund, who\nintend to release it for $3bn.\nThe current negotiations\nare remarkably similar to\nthose in 1999, when HSBC\nHoldings Ltd sought to purchase Korea First as whole,\nbut was unwilling to transfer the amount the Korean\ngovernment demanded. Now,\nthough, HSBC has resumed\nits interest and it seems the\nexplosive growth of the Asian\nmarkets is the driving force\nbehind such an acquisition.\nKorean First Bank announced\nthird-quarter net profits of\n$30bn, a jump of 76% from\n2003.\nCredit card ruling\nA high court ruled last\nweek that purchases made\nabroad on credit cards would\nnot be protected under the\nConsumer Credit Card Act of\n1974.\nThe act, which allows consumers to claim compensation for transactions under\n\u00a330,000 if their contract is not\nhonoured, item is wrongly\ndescribed or does not arrive,\nwill no longer be applicable\noutside the UK. The beauty of this act, and the credit\ncard suppliers\u2019 detestation of\nit, is that the cardholder can\nclaim compensation directly\nfrom the card issuer rather\nthan the firm itself. This led\nUK credit card providers to\nreport spiralling liability costs\noverseas and resulted in last\nweek\u2019s victory against the\nOffice of Fair Trading, who\nwill now appeal against the\nruling.\nThe case, brought to the\ncourt by Tesco Finance, Amex\nand Lloyds TSB, however,\nhad the purpose of removing final resting liability with\ncard issuers in order to prevent mounting losses, especially with regards to online\ntransactions, which also form\na part of this case. At the\nmoment, the main dilemma\nfor firms is to protect customers from high risk, high value\nproducts bought from unrep-utable sources overseas while\nalso trying to lower costs and\nhence customer charges.\nLast week\u2019s judgement\nmeans that consumer protection is at the discretion of\nthe firm and depends on its\ngoodwill towards consum-ers, both of which will be left\nunchanged by the ruling by\nat least two banks, HSBC and\nthe Bank of Scotland.\nEvolution goes extremist\non short selling\nEvolution Securities, formerly Evolution Beeson Gregory,\nwas last week fined \u00a3500,000\nfor extrapolating it\u2019s strategy of short-selling, a method used by brokers to issue\nshares in advance of owning\nthem.\nAlthough this is perfectly\nlegal, one broker at Evolution\ntook it to such an extreme\nthat she sold two and a half\ntimes the total share issue\ncapital. The FSA came down\non Evolution after several\ninvestors\u2019 complaints of not\nreceiving shares and for the\nfirst time in the UK fined a\nfirm for \u2018market distortion\u2019, a\nform of market abuse.\nThe most significant consequence of this regulatory\nadvance by the FSA is that\nindividual investors are now\nmore protected in this sector,\nthus balancing the depreciation in protection from overseas purchases!\nIrate Irish\nThe Consumer\u2019s Association\n(CA) has announced a \u2018super\ncomplaint\u2019 after realising\nthat, year after year, the Irish\nbanks are consistently overcharging their customers in\ncomparison to their UK coun-terparts.\nAlthough consumer edu-cation, including knowing\nwhere to look and to shop\naround, is partly to blame for\nthe superfluous charges, the\nprimary reason is simply that\nthe top four Northern Ireland\n(NI) banks are placing their\ncharges within three pence\nof each other. The banks, who\nown amongst them 80% of\nthe total market share, have\nno extra costs or significant\noverheads that force them to\nhave such charges and are\nabusing their position in NI.\nFor instance, a two week\noverdraft for \u00a3500 would cost\n\u00a329 in the UK and \u00a3189 in NI,\nand cashing a cheque is free\nin the UK and at least 42p\nin NI.\nThis has frustrated the CA\nwho can now expect a decision\nby the Office of Fair Trading\nwithin two weeks due to the\nenhanced \u2018super complaint\u2019\nnature of the reporting.\nKorean First Bank in Asia:\nHSBC hopes to acquire a\nmajority shareholding to up\nit's stake in the Asian retail\nand medium size enterprise\nbusiness\nCredit card caution: purchases made abroad will no longer be protected under the\nConsumer Credit Card Act 1974\n\n"

    "content": "First of all, the trailer to this film is\nrather misguiding and pretty atro-cious, but the actual movie itself is\na bundle of laughter.\nConfusingly, the trailer gives the\nimpression that the movie is an\naction flick, but it turns out that\nTaxi falls into the comedy genre,\nand is a pretty good example at that.\nOne would think that the distribu-tors, 20th Century Fox, would give\nthe trailer more thought considering that it plays an integral part in\nthe decision-making process of the\nviewer: should they see the movie\nor not?\nRegardless of the trailer though,\nthe movie is pretty hilarious; not\ndue to the crazy jokes and brilliant\nwitty comments, but because of the\nplain lunacy of the plot, characters\nand overall feel.\nThis isn\u2019t a movie that is going\nto inspire you to greatness or\nincrease your IQ level. Just like\nBelle Williams (Queen Latifah) says\nto Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon),\n\u201cdon\u2019t think!\u201d\nThat is the key here. Watch it if\nyou are up for a good laugh and\nafter a couple of pints in the pub.\nNow for the secret plot of the\nmovie! What plot? There really\nisn\u2019t one. However there is a story,\ndirected by Tim Story (yes, that is\nactually his name!)\nBelle is a high speed taxi driver\nwho fires through New York streets\nway over the speed limits, with\ngadgets in her cab that put James\nBond and Batman to utter shame.\nHer normal life is put on hold\nwhen she meets wannabe top-cop\nWashburn whose undercover and\ndriving skills are on the lower side\nof the scale. They end up in a high\npursuit of four bank robbers, led by\nthe cold and calculating Vanessa\n(Gisele B\u00fcndchen).\nThis ultimately leads to Belle losing her taxi to the FBI and making\nher boyfriend lock her out of the\napartment. Belle joins forces with\nbadgeless Washburn to get her taxi\nback, and the only way to do this is\nto figure out the thieves\u2019 plot and\ncatch them. This is easier said than\ndone.\nObviously the highly accurate\nbank robbing plan is carried out by\nfour Brazilian supermodels, led by\nVanessa. Her acting is totally hor-rible, but this doesn\u2019t matter as her\nscenes are based around her impossibly long legs.\nThere is also a little girl-to-girl\naction that comes in between. So\nis this a guy flick? Yes. But\nneedless to say, the action scenes,\nhigh-speed car driving, humorous cliffhanger moments and silly\nmayhem provide fun for all. It\u2019s\ncomedy and something you could\nsee with your friends and have loads\nof fun.\nVidula Vinayagamoorthy\nTaxi, going places\nCourtesy of Vue Cinemas, Felix Film had an exclusive screening of Taxi last Friday.

Email all\nanswers to film.felix@ic.ac.uk.\nClosing date for both competitions is 22 November. Usual Felix\ncompetition rules apply.\nStar Wars goes online\nRight, lets get one thing straight\nladies. Your boyfriends will not have\nbeen best pleased if you decided to\ndrag them along to watch Bridget\nJones: The Edge of Reason. Those\nof us with the Y chromosome have\nbeen dreading this film. No \u2018buts\u2019.\nI had the misfortune of being\ndragged kicking and screaming to\nwatch it at the weekend. I knew that\nThe Edge of Reason was a chick\nflick. I am not judging this movie on\nthat basis; The Edge of Reason is an\nadequate chick flick. Fundamentally\nthough, there are some humungous\nproblems with this movie.\nDarcy and Cleaver are utterly\nunrealistic \u2013 no male in the real\nworld is anything like them! I found\nCleaver to be downright sickening,\nand a complete misrepresentation\nof boyfriends around the world.\nAnother problem with this movie\nwas the part where Bridget goes\nto jail \u2013 a complete time-filler and\ntotally peripheral to the actual \u2018plot\u2019\nof the movie. There really is no plot\nnow is there? Was there any character development? Did anything\nreally change between the start and\nthe finish? No.\nThe soundtrack was terrible, one\npop song after another, with absolutely no imagination or originality at all. The script was terrible, so\nbad in fact that I actually burst out\nlaughing at the most inappropriate\nmoment.\nI could go on for ours about why\nI hated The Edge of Reason, but\nthere\u2019s not enough room. As a final\nword on it, do yourselves a favour\nladies and leave your boyfriends at\nhome on Championship Manager\nwhen you go and watch this. It\u2019s\nprobably less destructive to your\nrelationship (but only marginally).\nOn to more positive things, I saw\nThe Grudge and Bad Santa last\nweek, which were absolutely fan-tastic. The Grudge is good example\nof horror movies at their best and\nBad Santa is so funny and politically\nincorrect it seemed wrong. They\ncome highly recommended. Also,\nalthough I didn\u2019t have time to do a\nreview, Shaolin Soccer is well worth\nwatching. I saw it a couple of years\nago, and wet myself. All of you out\nthere with a childish, silly sense of\nhumour should go see it.\nFor all you stereotypical Imperial\nmales out there, the new Star\nWars trailer is now online at\nwww.starwars.com. Unfortunately\nthough, the film won\u2019t reach us until\n19 May 2005.\nOther trailers that are worth a\nlook are House Of Flying Daggers,\nthe next big movie coming out of\nChina, which stars Zhang Ziyi and\nAndy Lau. Then there is Elektra,\na spin-off from Daredevil. There\u2019s\nalso a sequel to The Ring, unorigi-nally entitled The Ring Two. Those\nof you with a nervous disposition\nand a VCR should avoid this. Those\nof you who like to torment your-selves, like me... enjoy!\nHappy cinema going!\nALAN NG\nFILM EDITOR\nEnough reason for 70% of Imperial to go watch ths movie\nWant to review films, get free tickets and go to previews?

This in some instances\ncan make people feel low and down\nabout things. Also, this time leading\nup to Christmas in the academic\nyear is a notoriously busy time for\nstudents with lots of deadlines to\nkeep up with and a very high work-load.\nEveryone at some time in their\nlives feels down, sad or low; this\nis of course a normal part of life.\nPeople often describe themselves\nas depressed when really what they\nmean is that they are feeling a bit\ndown. However, when these feelings are not just for a couple of days\nat a time but in fact are for weeks\nor even months, this could mean\nthat you are suffering from clinical\ndepression.\nThis can affect everything you do\nand sometimes you can feel like\nthere is just no way out.\nIt is important to know how you\nfeel when you become depressed,\nand it is also important for your\nfriends, family and housemates to\nknow what to look for in you if they\nfeel you are suddenly not your normal self.\nHere are some things to look out\nfor in yourself and other people who\nyou may feel are depressed:\n\u25cf A feeling of overwhelming sadness\nand a loss of interest and pleasure\nin things you would normally enjoy\n\u25cf Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or\nhopelessness\n\u25cf Difficulty in sleeping and particularly that you are waking up a lot\nearlier in the morning\n\u25cf Feelings of anxiety, tension\n\u25cf Becoming irrationally worried\nand irritable\n\u25cf Feelings of tiredness, no energy\nor appetite, and loss of weight\n\u25cf Difficulty in concentrating, making decisions or remembering\nthings\n\u25cf Having recurrent thoughts of\ndeath or suicide\nIf you are suffering with depres-sion, you may feel that there is noone out there who can help you.\nBut at Imperial, there are plenty\nof people who can help. The Health\nCentre on campus can help people\nsuffering from depression, and so\ncan the College Counselling service.\nThe Union Advice Service can also\nhelp if it is affecting your work. Just\nremember, you are not alone.\nIf you have an interest in this\narticle or would like further infor-mation, please contact the Union\nAdvice Service on 020 7594 8067 or\nadvice@ic.ac.uk.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nPeople often ask me, \u201cWhat\u2019s so\ngreat about the Union anyway? Why\nshould I get involved?\u201d\nThere are lots of reasons that\nspring to mind: a superb range\nof clubs and societies; affordable\nplaces to buy food, drink, stationery\nor regalia; an evening of entertainment at one of our \u2018Ents\u2019 nights...\nthe list seems endless. However, the\none thing that makes me passionate about making a difference for\nImperial College students is repre-sentation. Indeed, one of the Union\u2019s\nprimary aims (and the only thing\nthat no other body is going to do)\nis to represent its students to the\nCollege and other bodies.\nHow do we do this? Well, in order\nto accurately convey the views of\nour students, we need to know what\nyour views are! The usual mechanism for this is our network of elected representatives, and it is right\nthat we should place emphasis on\nthis, since the Union is a democratically run organisation. However,\nthere are times when we need\nstudent feedback in a more direct\nway. One of those times is now. We\nneed direct student input on two\nbig projects which are taking place\nat the moment. The first of these is\nthe Union\u2019s Strategic Review, which\nis described in more detail on the\nopposite page. The other project is\nthe QAA Audit.\nThis year, the College will undergo\nwhat\u2019s known as Institutional Audit\nby the Quality Assurance Agency\n(QAA), an independent body set up\nto safeguard the public interest in\nsound academic standards. This\nis done by carrying out reviews of\nstandards and quality in higher education institutions.\nThe QAA considers student\ninvolvement in the audit process to\nbe very important and there are a\nnumber of ways in which students\nwill be involved. During the auditors\u2019 visit, groups of students will\nbe invited to meet with the auditors\nto discuss various aspects of their\nexperience of the College.\nIn addition to this, Imperial\nCollege Union is also invited to submit a written statement to the QAA\non behalf of the student body. The\nUnion considers this a worthwhile\nopportunity to contribute to improving standards within Imperial\nCollege and is now undertaking a\nresearch project that will form the\nbasis of our submission to the QAA.\nThe Union will soon be launching a questionnaire whose aims are\ntwofold: it will allow us to better\nrepresent your views when it comes\nto writing the submission, as well\nas forming the heart of the feedback necessary for the success of\nthe strategic review. Check out the\nUnion website\u2019s homepage (www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk) for the latest news\non these exciting projects.\nUNCLE SAM\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nWhere does the money go?\nImperial College Union is a \u00a36m\nturnover organization. You might\nlike to know where this money\ncomes from and how it is spent.\nSo, I thought I\u2019d spend this column\ngoing through it all. The key thing to\nrealise is that whenever you spend\nmoney in the Union it gets reinvested in student services and activities\nto benefit you.\nSubvention\nThe College gives the Union a sub-vention each year of around \u00a31m.\nThis is intended to support the core\nactivities of the Union: representing students, supporting your educational needs, looking after your\nwelfare and promoting legitimate\nstudent activities.\nThe money we receive from\nCollege effectively comes from the\nGovernment, so there are restrictions on what we can spend it on. We\ncan only spend the money directly\non Imperial students, and in accordance with the terms laid down by the\nCollege. We cannot, for example, use\nit to buy free beer for everyone.\nTrading income\nThe bulk of the Union\u2019s income\ncomes from our commercial servic-es. This includes the bars and catering in Beit Quad, Charing Cross and\nWye campus, as well as the shop and\nnewsagent on the South Kensington\ncampus\u2019 main walkway.\nBecause the Union is part of the\nCollege, which is a public body, we\nare again limited in what we can\nspend this money on \u2013 we have\nto spend it, directly, in benefiting\nImperial students. However, provided we meet that criterion, we can\nspend this money on pretty much\nanything. There are no detailed con-ditions, unlike with the grant from\nCollege.\nOf course, the trading operations\nhave costs too. Yet these are lower\nthan the income from these outlets.\nThe point is that the profits are\nused to subsidise the various other\nactivities of the Union. Whenever\nyou spend money in the Union, you\nare effectively spending money on\nyourself since the proceeds will be\nreinvested in student activities and\nservices.\nClubs and societies\nThe second biggest source of the\nUnion\u2019s funding comes from the\nclubs and societies. The Union, of\ncourse, gives money to clubs and\nsocieties, but they also raise a fair\namount themselves. All clubs have\na minimum membership fee which\nis calculated to be 25% of whatever\ngrant they have been given. On top\nof this, grants for some activities are\nonly part-subsidised (for example,\ntravel is subsidised by the Union\nat 50% with the balance being paid\nby the club or society\u2019s members).\nMany clubs are also successful at\ngenerating income through ticketed\nevents and sponsorship.\nThe Union supplements the money\nthe clubs raise themselves by giving\neach club a grant. These grants are\ncalculated during the annual budgeting round, held during the spring\nterm.\nAdministration, welfare and\nrepresentation\nJust under 10% of the Union\u2019s\nmoney is spent on office \u2018admin\u2019\ncosts. However, very little of this\nreally is admin. Much of it is representation (provision of sabbatical\nofficers and appropriate supporting\nfunctions). The Union also provides\na number of welfare services from\nthe full-time Union Adviser to the\nprogramme of \u2018soft skills\u2019 personal\ndevelopment courses.\nKeeping the buildings going\nSome money is also spent each\nyear on the upkeep of the Union\u2019s\nbuildings. We do not pay rent to\nthe College but we are responsible\nfor maintaining our own areas. In\naddition we also set aside a small\namount each year to save up for\nsmall to medium size refurbishment\nprojects. The last major project was\nthe establishment, in 2001, of the\nUnion\u2019s Media Centre and Student\nActivities Centre in the West and\nEast wing basements of Beit respec-tively.\nSummary \u2013 Union profits are\nreinvested in you\nThe Union is run for students, by stu-dents. The grant from the College is\nthe smallest chunk of the pie. Most\nof our money actually comes from\nstudents\u2019 own pockets (the trading income and the self-generated\nincome of the clubs and societies).\nAnd all of the Union\u2019s money is\nspent, in one way or another, on stu-dents, as directed by democratically\nelected student officers.\nIt\u2019s therefore important to remember that when you spend money in\nthe Union you are not only supporting the Union but essentially spending money on yourself. So next time\nyou are concerned about your club\nor society not having enough money,\nor not enough being spent on services that you use, please bear this in\nmind: if you decide to spend money\nin the Union that you would otherwise have spent elsewhere then you\nare increasing the pot of money that\nthe Union can spend on you.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\n\n"

    "content": "To those who haven\u2019t studied\nEngland in the 12th century or\nhave seen the classic 1964 film with\nRichard Burton and Peter O\u2019Toole,\nthe story of King Henry II and\nThomas \u00e0 Becket maybe rather\nunfamiliar. It is one of the greatest stories of friendship of English\nhistory, combining love, obsession,\ngreed and a mammoth power struggle between two men.\nThe play Becket was written in\n1958 by the French playwright Jean\nAnouilh, who took several liberties\nwith historical accuracy. He tells the\nstory of Thomas \u00e0 Becket as a Saxon\nnoble confused in Henry\u2019s Norman\ncourt, uncomfortable with Henry\u2019s\ndeep trust in him and in conflict\nbetween his loyalty to his king, the\nchurch and his own roots. This new\nproduction takes a traditional stance\non the play, and stars Dougray Scott\nas Becket, and Jasper Britton as\nHenry II.\nAt the start of the play, Henry has\nsingled out Becket from his group of\nnobles as his particular companion,\nand together they pass their time\nhunting and womanising. Henry\nconfides in Becket and, against the\nwishes of his other advisors, he\nmakes the young Becket chancellor.\nThe death of the Archbishop of\nCanterbury gives Henry the opportunity to make reforms in the\nchurch, and he decides to appoint\nBecket as the new Archbishop.\nBecket tries to refuse, telling Henry,\n\u201cI can\u2019t serve God and you at the\nsame time,\u201d but the King is ada-mant, and Becket is consecrated as\nthe new Archbishop.\nAbsorbed by his new role, Becket\nresigns as chancellor and turns\naway from his old life of excess to\nthat of an ascetic priest. He protects\nthe Church\u2019s interests and refuses\nto allow Henry to make the changes\nhe wants. Henry is furious, and soon\ntheir conflict reaches crisis point,\nforcing Becket to flee to the conti-nent.\nThe Pope insists that Becket and\nHenry make peace, and Becket\nreturns to England, but soon after\nexcommunicates the Archbishop of\nYork. Henry flies into a rage when he\nhears the news, which prompts four\nof his nobles to storm Canterbury\nCathedral. Upon his refusal to pardon those he has excommunicated,\nthey stab him to death, leaving his\ncorpse on the altar.\nAnouilh\u2019s take on the story has\na lot to do with his experiences\nin Nazi-occupied France. Dougray\nScott, as Becket, expertly portrays\nBecket\u2019s more duty-filled actions,\nbut his high-handed treatment of\nthe King before his consecration is\nsomewhat unconvincing. Although\nthe King relies on him heavily, looks\nup to him and is constantly reliant on his opinion, Scott\u2019s portrayal\nseems too detached, making the\nconflict he experiences more about\nhis duty to the King and God, rather\nthan his personal conflict of friendship versus duty.\nBritton\u2019s Henry is a much more\nengaging character. His alternating\nweakness and strength, his ever-changing power over Becket as a\nKing against Becket\u2019s power over\nhim as a mentor makes the play\nboth absorbing and unsettling. His\nobsession with Becket is convinc-ing, and his struggle to uphold his\nown wishes in the face of Becket\u2019s\ntyrannical attitude, coupled with\nhis deep personal love for Becket\nis seamlessly depicted. His growing self-hatred is sympathetically\nplayed, and by the end his final decision is both believable and a natural\nclimax.\nDon\u2019t be put off this play by its\ncomplex historical context. The language and style are contemporary\nand approachable, and the repeating\nmotifs of oppression and racism are\nstrikingly relevant to today\u2019s society.\nBut the lasting impression is of the\ndestructive friendship between the\ntwo leads, and the timeless conflict\nof love with duty.\n\u25cf Becket runs at the Theatre\nRoyal Haymarket until 12\nFebruary 2005 and is directed by John Caird.

Both France and\nJapan remained equal candidates to host the $12 billion reactor project. Nuclear\nfusion has been touted as\na long-term solution to the\nworld\u2019s energy problems, as\nit would be low in pollution\nand use limitless sea water\nas fuel.\nArctic thaw could\nopen vast new oil\nand gas region\nAn accelerating thaw of the\nArctic may open vast regions\nfor oil and gas exploration,\nbut that brings worries of\nspills in the fragile environ-ment. Scientists behind an\neight-nation report, saying that the Arctic sea ice\ncould almost vanish in\nsummer by 2100, said\noffshore oil and gas operations would be easier but\nmelting permafrost could\ndestabilize installations on\nland. However, oil companies\nremain unconvinced.\nNew UK airport\nscanner undresses\npassengers\nA new X-ray machine at\nLondon\u2019s Heathrow airport,\nwhich sees through passengers\u2019 clothes, has been\nattacked by civil liberties\ncampaigners. The machine\nuses low-level radiation to\nsee through clothing, producing an anatomically detailed\nblack and white image of the\nbody underneath. Capable\nof detecting solid objects\nconcealed under clothing, it\nstarted a four month trial in\nOctober.\nA DAY IN THE DIET OF... Dave Edwards\nRosie Taylor, Felix Science dietician, evaluates the Felix Editor\u2019s diet\n9am Breakfast is a bowl of Shreddies, with milk. Also a glass of orange juice.\n1pm Lunch from the JCR (a sandwich or the famous cooked breakfast) or maybe a chicken curry with rice if they\u2019re serving\nit at the Union. Throughout the day in my office, I\u2019ll be topping up from the water cooler \u2013 perhaps three cups in total.\n7pm For dinner I\u2019ll probably cook something from frozen, maybe chicken or turkey with chips. This will be accompanied\nby canned veg (sweet corn, baked beans etc) or a bag of pre-prepared veg from the fridge. I\u2019ll have a couple of glasses of\ncranberry juice, an apple and a Fruit Corner yogurt. A couple of times a week, I\u2019ll probably eat out and/or share a bottle of\nwine with someone.\n10pm I\u2019ll usually have an evening snack too, perhaps a chocolate mini roll. Actually my current favourite is Cadbury\u2019s white chocolate fingers.\nRosie Taylor, Felix Science dietician, says...\nDave starts the day well with a high fibre breakfast cereal. This is filling, and low in calories, not to mention full of nutrients. By including a glass of orange\njuice, he tots up a portion of fruit and vegetables, of which we should all be aiming for five every day. Dave\u2019s lunch varies from a sandwich, to a cooked break-fast. The sandwich is likely to be the healthier option. But as he only occasionally has the cooked breakfast, it\u2019s not too much of concern.\nThe evening meal is well balanced. Three tablespoons of tinned, frozen or fresh vegetables, including beans, count as a portion towards the five a day. The\ncranberry juice cannot count towards his fruit and vegetable intake since fruit juice can only count once a day, although of course he is still benefiting from the\nvitamins in the juice. The very healthy pudding of yoghurt and a piece of fruit completes his meal.\nDave says that he sometimes shares a bottle of wine. Current government recommendations advise that we have at least one or two alcohol-free days each\nweek to rest the liver, and Dave does well to adhere to this. The evening snack of chocolate, in the context of what is a very well-balanced diet, is perfectly\nacceptable. Overall, Dave\u2019s diet is really very good. He would do well to include some vegetables with his lunch, and an extra piece of fruit as a snack, but\notherwise, he\u2019s got the balance just right!\nOverall score: 8/10 Fruit and Veg: 4/5\nBy Amadeus Stevenson\nPhysics department\nLast we looked at software\nvulnerabilities and why you\nshould keep your computer\nupdated. The Internet Storm\nCentre (ISC) reported recently that 20 minutes was all that\na new un-updated copy of\nWindows XP needs until it is\ntaken over with worms, viruses and spyware. Chances are\nthat as you are reading this\nyour computer will have software surreptitiously using up\nyour computer\u2019s resources\nwithout your knowledge and\ntransmitting personal information to a third party.\nWhat is adware?\nAdware is advertising supported software, such as the\nfree version of the Opera web\nbrowser. These rely on showing the user advertisements\nwhile the program is running,\nso that the programmers can\ngenerate revenue to reduce\nthe cost of the product, and\nmake sure development is\nconstant. Some adware contains code which will collect\npersonal information about\nyou and send it to a third\nparty without your knowledge\n\u2013 this is spyware.\nThere are varying types\nof spyware, from tracking\nbrowser \u2018cookies\u2019 that record\nwhich websites you visit and\npass this information on to\nthird parties, which are easy\nto remove, to Browser Helper\nObjects (BHOs). BHOs can\nbe very useful (such as the\nGoogle toolbar), but the spyware variants can jeopardise\nyour privacy and computer\nstability, and are often very\ndifficult to remove. Many\ninstances of spyware can\nexist on a computer, which\nvery often will slow it down to\na crawl.\nHow did it get on my\ncomputer?\nA lot of spyware comes bundled with other programs,\nor is \u2018needed\u2019 to view certain websites \u2013 you agree to\ninstalling it on your computer\nby not reading the small print\n(License Agreement)!\nSome examples include\nKazaa, Grokster, Weatherbug\n(which installs itself with AOL\nInstant Messenger) and many\ndubious (pornographic or illegal software) websites which\nwill ask you to proceed with\nthe installation of \u2018required\u2019\nsoftware to view their site. If\nyou\u2019ve ever clicked \u2018Yes\u2019 without bothering to read what\nyou\u2019re being fed (see article\npictures) then chances are\nyou\u2019ve installed it yourself!\nOther spyware can install\nitself without your help\nthanks to the many vulnerabilities in Microsoft\u2019s Internet\nExplorer. If you use IE and\ndon\u2019t update it frequently, you\nare at risk. Many of these\ninstall attempts branch from\npopups on sites, which is why\na popup blocker such as the\none in Google\u2019s toolbar, or\nwith the Windows XP Service\nPack 2, is good idea. Also recommended is trying a different browser such as Mozilla\u2019s\nFirefox, which has a built-in\npopup blocker and far fewer\nsecurity holes.\nHow can I get rid of it?\nLuckily there exist some\nexcellent programs to clean\nup your computer if you are\ninfected, or suspect you are.\nWith many things like this\n(viruses), the best way to get\nrid of them is to prevent them\nhappening in the first place.\nWhat will it do?\nSpyware, when present in\nmultiple instances, will use\nup your system resources\n(CPU, memory and network\nbandwidth) and can slow your\ncomputer significantly down.\nThe worst kind of spyware is\nsimilar to a Trojan horse, in\nthat it will capture information as you type it, such as\ncredit card details and pass-words, and send this on to\nsomeone else who will use\nthis information.\nIs spyware illegal?\nIn October 2004 the US House\nof Representatives (joint\nSenate and Congress) ratified\nthe \u2018Spy Act\u2019 and \u2018Internet\nSpyware Prevention Act\u2019\nwhich impose heavy fines and\njail terms of up to five years\nfor individuals using spyware\nto gather information for\ncriminal purposes.\nUnfortunately implementing these laws will take time,\nand as we have seen from\nthe recent \u2018CAN-SPAM Act\u2019,\npassed to reduce the amount\nof spam, or junk email, we\nreceive, it may not have a big\nimpact on the day to day problems we have with spyware.\nAs we saw with vulnerabilities two weeks ago, Microsoft\nWindows systems seem to be\nmuch more affected by spyware than Mac/Linux/BSD\nequivalents. Try a different\nbrowser to Internet Explorer,\nadd this to the measures on\nthe left and you should be fine\nfor using the internet without\ntoo many worries.\nWatching your every move on the internet\nRecent reports show that 80-90% of computers are infected with spyware.\nHere\u2019s the lowdown for your questions and the downloads you need\nSymptoms of spyware\n\u25cf Getting unrelated popups when browsing or\neven when not browsing\n\u25cf Computer slowing to a crawl?
