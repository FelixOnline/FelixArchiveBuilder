    "content": "International poet and scientist to visit IC\nScience, Art, and Ethics\nHow long is now? Looking back it\nseemed like ages of silence.\nI was standing at the bar, a pint of\nbitter comforting my sense of doing, as\nthought about what I could say. He was\nan artist, and the other a poet. They\nlooked at me. I said nothing. They\nwanted me to speak. 1 had nothing to\nsay. How could I, a student scientist,\nrelate to their\nways of seeing\nand doing.\nMiroslav Holub\nconcludes the title\nessay of his book\na metaphorical monument to the heroes\nof science, in his short story Argonauts of\nthe Air.\nMiroslav Holub is a scientist, in the true\nWellsian sense. He is a prolific writer of\npoetry and essays, whilst researching into\nimmunology in Prague.\nIs he an unusual mam? Undoubtedly. As Ted Hughes, poet Laureatte, has written\nThe Demension\nof the Present\nMoment and\nother essays with\n'In this sense, our\nego lasts three\nseconds.\nEverything else is\neither hope or an\nembarrassing\nincident. Usually\nboth.'\nMy embarrassing\nincident was a feeling of two\nworlds, the artist\nand the scientist.\nThe world of the\ncreative\nimagination and\npersonal\nstatement, and\nthat of the dry\nrepetitive\ncramming,\nmeasuring and\ncounting. Yet\ndoes science\nreally destroy our\nsense of wonder\nand creativity,\nwhilst art\nnurtures and\nexpresses it?\nThis is a question that H.G. Wells raised as a student here. In the preface to the\nstudent magazine he founded and edited\nhe writes down his expectations. He\nexpected scientists to be writers and\npoets. Part of this vision of a creative\nscientist was inspired by his lecturer, the\nDean of the College, Professor T.H. Huxley. Wells was bitterly disappointed\nand uses the destruction of the College as\nBrief Reflection on test-tubes\nTake\na piece of fire, a piece of water,\na piece of a rabbit or a piece of a tree,\nor any piece of a human being,\nmix it, shake it, stopper it up,\nkeep it warm, in the dark, in the light, refrigerated,\nlet it stand still for a while\u2014yourselves far from still\nbut that's the real joke.\nAfter a while\nyou look\u2014and it's growing,\na little ocean, a little volcano,\na little tree, a little heart, a little brain,\nso little you don't hear it lamenting\nas it wants to get out,\nbut that's the real joke, not hearing it.\nThen go\nand record it, all dashes or\nall crosses, some with exclamation-marks,\nall noughts and all figures, some with\nexclamation-marks,\nand that's the real joke, in effect a test-tube\nis a device for changing noughts\ninto exclamation-marks.\nThat's the real joke\nwhich makes you forget for a while\nthat really you yourself are\nIn the test-tube.\n'Miroslav Holub is one of the half dozen\nmost important poets writing anywhere'.\nBut is he an abbe ration? Is his\ncombination of science and art a freak\naccident against the nature of these\nsubjects?\nThis is one among many questions that\nMiroslav explores, questions about the\nnature of our behaviour, what is a sane\nPoem printed by kind permission of Bloodaxe Books Ltd\nperson, ethics and science, disease and\nsociety. His personal reflections give a sense of excitement and wit whilst\ntravelling down beautifully guided\npathways of discovery, full of unexpected\nviews and destinations.

    "content": "s Massive restructuring of the college day is\nbeing considered by a college committee,\nthe 'Working Party on the College Day',\nchaired by Professor Alan Swanson.\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, told Felix that\nthe idea had emerged from a Board of\nStudies discussion in which students were\nrepresented. He pointed out that the\ncollege was 'short of teaching space -lecture rooms, seminar rooms, short of\nspace at lunch, short of timetabling space\nwith the novel combinations like\nchemistry and management and four\nyear courses requiring language study'.\nHe said that the committee was to\nrecieve feedback from students, and\nstressed that there was to be no increase\nin contact hours. He preferred a 'reduction on number of lecture hours'\nand an increase in the number of\nseminars.\nHe added that 'classical office hours\nwere a terrible straitjacket' and 'there\nwas a lot to be said for starting at 8.30',\nwhich would ease travel from afar as it\nwould avoid the rush hour. He said that\nstaff who would still hit the rush hour\ncould come in earlier and work before\nthe proper day started.\nProfessor Swanson said that the\ncommittee was still in the process of\nasking the departments for their views,\nand that the IC Union President, Paul\nShanley, was on the committee to express\nthe students' point of view. He said that\nthe Humanities department couldn't do its\njob under the present timetabling\nconstraints. In addition departments will\nhave to be controlled to stop them giving\nmore lectures in the extra time this\nproposal would produce.\nHe added that he had written to all the\npeople who might be affected - including\nRob Northey, Refectories Manager - to\nask their opinions.\nThe change to the college day will be\ndiscussed at the Union General Meeting at\n1.00 on Thursday 8th November in the\nGreat Hall. Please note that the date in\nthe advertisement on the back cover is\nwrong - the U GM is on Thursday, not\nTuesday as printed.\nStick-Up Suzanne Ahmet Resigns\nThe Management schools' plaque was\nmysteriously returned to its original\nposition last Sunday. It was stuck to the\nwall upside down with Blu Tack, with a carrot attached. A message was left with\nthe sign saying that it had come from 'the\nPhantom Carrot'. The perpetrator is\nthought to reside in Falmouth Keogh Hall.\nIt is believed that a member of the\nRoyal College of Science Union (RCSU)\nstole the sign believing it to be a part of\nmascot ry. The RCSU mascot ry team have\nbeen unavailable for comment.\nThe original sign was due for\nrep a cement and a new plaque has been\non order for some time.\nMore\nThefts\nA 'considerable amount of theft' has\noccured this term, according to Mr Terry\nBriley, security officer at IC. 'Since the\nbeginning of the term there have been 38\nrecorded thefts .. this is worse than\nbefore', he said on Wednesday.\nHe added that this week has seen three\nbike thefts - a total of \u00a3600. A wallet\ncontaining cheque book, driving licence\nand \u00a3220 was stolen from the Union\nGym. Mr Briley advised that lockers must\nbe used, and added that if anyone is seen\nacting suspiciously - for example loitering\naround cars or in departments - the\nobserver should immediately report them\non extension 3372.\nA football kit and two footballs were\nstolen from the Southside bar on\nWednesday evening. Paul Shanley, Union\nPresident, said that the kit belonged to a member of Imperial's1st team and was\ninsured for \u00a3360.\nSuzanne Ahmet has resigned as External\nAffairs Officer (EAO) to enable her to\ncontinue her normal affairs as RCSU\nPresident. A letter of resignation was sent\nto Murray Williamson, Hon Sec (Events),\ndated the 28th October.\nPapers for the re-election of the E AO Insult\nLast week the Universities Funding\nCouncil (UFC) rejected university bids for\nan increase in Government funding.\nAlmost 95% of universities had requested\nan increase exceeding the levels\nsuggested. The move by the UFC may\nhave been in retaliation for the\nuniversities failing to meet 'cost-cutting'\ntargets previously set by the Government.\nThe decision was described by Sir\nEdward Parkes as a 'grotesque insult to\nuniversities'.\nThe university bids may have been an\nattempt to cover the cost of the\nGovernment's plan to double the number\nof students entering higher education by\nthe year 2000. Student numbers have\nincreased by about 13% over the last two\nyears without an increase in funding.\nSir Edward said that the Government's expansion plans were unrealistic at the\npresent level of funding and that he\nbelieved universities would not sacrifice\nthe quality of education to augment\nstudent numbers. He strongly denied\nallegations that universities had secretly\ncollaborated to sabotage the new funding\nsystem in which funds would be allocated\nto universities that could provide the\ncheapest education.\nMrs. Currie said ' Any expansion has to\nbe funded three ways; tax payers, the\nstudents and their families, and the\nuniversities themselves.'\nwere put up on the 29th October on the\nstaircase leading to the Union Office.\nWhen questioned about the action Ms\nAhmet said Td rather do two jobs well,\nthan three jobs in a mediocre-fashion'.\nSoon after Sir Geoffrey Howe resigned.\nUCLU Loss\nUniversity College Student Union (UCLU)\nare to lose their Gym, workshop and the\n'Garage'. This follows last year's wrangles\nover the affair (Felix, issues 868-870, May this year). Nick McAlpine, Publicity and\nCommunications officer of UCL U, told\nFelix that the affected clubs had been\nrelocated 'as a short term measure'.\nHe added that the pharmaceutical\ncompany 'Eisai' had 'donated' \u00a3250,000 to\nthe college for the use of their facilities,\nbut that it was the Medical Research\nCouncil (MRC) that was to use the area\npreviously occupied by Union buildings.\nHe added that 'the picture has improved\nsince we learned more .... we have all\ntalked sensibly and the college is very\nhelpful at the moment'. He said that the\nunion 'aims to get a long term solution -we are making sure that the issue is kept\non the boil'.\nGive Blood\nIf you want to help medical science but\ndon't want to die first, City and Guilds\nCollege Union (C& GU) will be running a blood donating session in the Southside\ngym on Tuesday the 13th November.\nSign up now in the Guilds office or in\nthe J CR this Tuesday (6th November). All of the college are welcome.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "Edwina curries favour with students in an.\nUnfolding Future\nOn Tuesday, Mrs Edwina Currie, MP, visited Imperial College. Security was\nrather higher than as for the similar visit\nby Mr Cecil Parkinson, Transport\nMinister, a fortnight ago, with two\nsecurity men on the door checking bags.\nMrs Currie started by asking whether\nLabour would win the next election, and\nanswered herself by saying 'they haven't got a chance'. She cited three reasons\nwhy she was optimistic of the Tories\nretaining a majority in Parliament.\nFirstly, Labour have a tendency to pile\nup votes in seats they already hold,\nrather than seeking to gain new territory,\nand in many of the seats, they need to\nwin to control Parliament, they are not\neven in second place behind the Tories,\nthus they need to displace the Liberal\nDemocrats (who she referred to as the\nAlliance).\nSecondly, as a General Election\napproaches, Labour policies would come\nunder closer scrutiny. She said that\npeople would find 'many of these\nunworkable, expensive or empty\npromises'. 'What Labour wants is to\nsatisfy every interest group in our society,\nwithout it costing anybody any extra\nmoney.'\n'If you go through policy documents\nlike Looking to the Future, which sounds\nlike something Spielberg should have\nbeen involved in, and add up what they\nwant to do, and you ask whether it is\nfeasible, in many cases the answer is\n'Could be'.'\nHowever, she said that these policies\ncould not be carried out 'without\nsubstantial increase in taxes'.\nThirdly, for this reason, she considered\nthat the Tory policies were vote-winners;\nvery few people want to part with more\nmoney than they have to.\nThe rhetoric over, she invited\nquestions. During these it emerged that\nshe was strongly against parents having\nto support their offspring through college\nor university. She said that while she was\nat university, she was on full grant, but\nthe people who had to get some or all of\ntheir money from their parents had a harder time with financial worries, it\nbeing more difficult to get money from\nthem than a local authority. She was also\nstrongly against further education\nIttfigii\n' : i l^H Hi St\nFELIX\nEdwina presenting a student with their top-up loan.\ninstitutions charging tuition fees to UK students, saying that 'We, as a nation,\nbenefit from you being students'. She\nthought that this should be the\nGovernment's contribution towards\nfurther education. She added, 'Living\nexpenses are your business'.\nHowever, when questioned about\nStudent Loans, and the effect that this\nwould have on discouraging people from\npoorer backgrounds going to university\nwith the prospect of a large debt at the\nend, Mrs Currie said that as the current\nstudent loan was only \u00a3 4 5 0 a year, no\none would get far into debt.\nThis begs the question of who is to\nfund further education. If the Government\npays tuition fees, and parents are not to\nbe involved, who pays the living\nexpenses? She encouraged people to get\nholiday jobs; regardless of the fact that\nnearly everyone does anyway, even if\nonly to placate the bank manager.\nWhen questioned about the withdrawal\nof housing benefit to students, and the\neffect this had on discouraging students in\nLondon because of the high costs, she\nsaid that the Government was neutral on\nwhere students go for their education, but\nthat housing benefit was 'for poor people,\nnot you'.\nShe stated that a full grant is more than\na single pensioner gets, and that it would\nbe very hard to justify students getting\nmore than pensioners. 'You'd better stock\nup on the thermal underwear and save\non heating bills.'\nThe National Curriculum was raised,\nand in defence of it she said that 'it is an\nenormous step forward to have one, and\nto insist that everybody learns their own language, can spell, can put syntax\ntogether, can add up'. ' You go out and\njust ask people how to convert a fraction\nto a decimal, they don't know what either\nof them are, let alone how to do it.'\nShe thought that there was something\nwrong with the national ethos whereby\npeople would much rather become\napprentices rather than go to university,\nand would employ accountants rather\nthan engineers in industrial management.\nHowever, with the increasing unity with\nEurope, she hoped that the respect for\nengineers in the UK would increase, as\non the Continent. She suggested that\nstudents should 'get good qualifications,\nbe ambitious and get into management,\nor found your own business' and then in\ntime it would be possible to push salaries\nfor engineers up.\nNo controversial questions were put to\nMrs Currie, and this was not because of\nthe machinations of ConSoc: Mrs Currie\nselected questions at random (unless She\nmemorised all ConSoc's faces!). There\nwasn't even a reference to eggs. Come on\nSocialists and Communists, where were\nyou? Afraid of being converted?\n\n"

After my article was\npublished in FELIX( on October 19) I spoke to many people (ranging from\nConservative to normal), all of whom said\nthat the article was fair and accurate. I therefore take strong objection to being\ncalled a liar by Mr McCarthy, who in a subsequent letter to FELIX states that he\nwas not even present to hear Mr Parkinson speak. Either he is psychic or\nMr McCarthy was told by one of his\nreliable and totally unbiased ConSoc\nfriends (he neglected to mention that he\nis the treasurer of ConSoc) that 1\nmisquoted Mr Parkinson.\nIf I did misquote, I did so completely\nunintentionally. Mr McCarthy may like to\nknow that in future FELIX will endeavour\n(where possible) to keep tape recordings\nin such situations to resolve any\nsubsequent differences of opinion\nbetween concerned parties.\nLastly I would like to congratulate Mr\nMcCarthy in making fun of the complete\nlack of security during Mr Parkinson's visit; he may have stumbled upon an antiterrorist policy that is much more\neffective than the government's present\none; let's laugh at serious lapses in\nsecurity and maybe the IRA won't blow\nus up.

Everybody was dead\njolly at this early stage.\nFollowing The Brothers came, among\nothers, Ocean Colour Scene and Flowered\nUp.

Flowered Up actually have\na Bez (re Happy Mondays) of their own\u2014\na total loony who looks like one of Bill\nand Ben's mates.\nBy this time it was two-ish and people\nwere tiring. We'd all had our supper (a jacket potato that I'm sure RS M would\nhave been interested in) and were\nlooking for some stimulation. The bouncy\ncastle beckoned but the smell of sweaty\nfeet that had finally escaped from the\nDMs soon put people off that as well.\nThey showed Grease on video, thus\ninciting a bit of singing en masse, which\nFlowered Up\nwas fun, but when Robocop came on the\ngeneral concensus was that it was just too\nloud for five in the morning.\nThe discos started well. There were\ntwo, one for the indie black jeans DM lot\nand another for the dancy E generation.\nBreakfast was excellent\u2014croissants, jam\nand multiple cups of coffee and at 4.30am seemed remarkably app et ising. The security staff, who were initially\njust indignant, had finally succumbed to\nweariness and now couldn't give a monkeys fuck for the party, the people or\nthe rules that governed them.\nSeven o 'clock arrived and it was time\nto go. A few hundred had lasted out but\nthose who were conscious numbered only\na few.\nOn the whole the night was fun, but\nnot worth the money. Live Aid it wasn't. London meets Manchester? Perhaps.\nPrefab Sprout Competition\nHammersmith Odeon 22.10.90\nWith the album comes the tour, originally\ntitled 'The Comeback.' Finishing with two\nnights at the Hammersmith Odeon, both\nof which sold out, they produced a show\nI will remember for a long time.\nPrefab Sprout have never hit the mega\nmarket and this showed in the age and\ndiversity of the audience, no screaming\nteenagers here.\nThey played tracks from four of their\nfive albums concentrating equally on the\nnew and old material.\nFor me the whole show was one\ncontinuous delight, culminating in their\nsecond encore with the playing of their\nmost famous song 'When Love Breaks\nDown' and finally 'Doo Wop in Harlem.'\nA wonderful night from a wonderful\ngroup, they are not to be missed if you\nlike music where you can hear the words.\nIan Hodge.\nWe are giving you the chance of winning\na copy of Prefab Sprout's latest album,\nJordon: The Comeback. We have three\ncopies of the cassette and two of the\ncompact disk, one of which could be\nyours if you answer all of the following\nquestions correctly.\nWho featured on harmonica on the From\nLangley Park to Memphis album?\nWhich of the following is not a Prefab\nSprout song?\na) Doo Wop in Harlam.\nb) The Devil has all the best tunes.\nc) Green Isaac.\nd) On the right hand of God.\nWho are the last four tracks on side one\nof Jordon about?\nWhich two members of the band are\nrelated and what do they play.\nAll entries should be sent to the FELIX office to arrive no later than Wednesday\n31st October.

    "content": "The Handmaid's Tale Kate (Natasha Richardson), her husband\nher small daughter have just failed to\nescape from the Republic of Gilead\n(formerly the USA). Her husband lies\ndead in the snow, she is surrounded by\narmed border guards, and her daughter\nhas stumbled off into the bushes\nfrightened by all the noise.\nShe ends up with many other women who, for one reason or another, have\nbeen rounded up by the police and they\nare separated into those who are fertile\nand those who are not. The fertile\nwomen are sent off to be trained as\nhandmaids\u2014surrogate mothers for couples\nwho cannot have children of their own because the wife is sterile.\nIt is the near future. What was formerly\nthe USA has been taken over by a group\nof religious right-wing fundamentalists.\n99% of the population have been\nrendered sterile as a result of nuclear\naccidents and chemicals in the\natmosphere. The government supports\nracism and capital punishment (by\nhanging) for such crimes as rape, adultery\nand homosexuality.\nThe origin for the handmaids comes\nQueendom\nCome\nBy Ellen Galford\nThe author of this book doesn't have a chip on her shoulder, she's got five\npounds of King Edwards!\nSet in a future world where the\nConservative party has created a Blue\nReich, the story revolves mainly around\nScotland in general, and Edinburgh in\nparticular. The government has taken the\nConservative ideals to their illogical\nextremes, culminating with such\nmomentous pieces of legislation as 'The\nSexual Normality Act.'\nTo save the people from their\npredicament Queen Albanna is brought\nforward in time by her sorceress. As you\ncan imagine she comes from a time\nwhere things are rather different,\nparticularly in sexual terms.\nThe Prime Minister, as ever interested\nin her publicity, tries to use her to gain\nsupport for the dictatorship style\ngovernment. Unfortunately Albanna\ndoesn't play by the rules, creating havoc\nand mayhem wherever and whenever she\ncan.\nIt is defiantly not for the conservative\nminded and I don't expect many people\nhave read a lesbian love scene? Well you\nwon't here either but no subject is taboo\nand she def in at ly pulls no punches when\nit comes to the present government.\nA reasonable book but I can't help\nthinking that if she could control her\nparanoia the author could become a very\ngood writer.\nIan Hodge.\nfrom the story in the Old Testament of\nJacob and Rachel. Rachel gave her\nhandmaid to Jacob so she could have a child for her. This story forms the basis of\nthe 'ceremony': a sexual act taking place\nat a time when the handmaid is at her\nmost fertile and in the presence of the\nwife. It is very cold and impersonal and\nunsettling for all three involved.\nAlthough, because of their fertility,\nhandmaids have theoretically got a high\nposition in society, they are very much beneath wives and are actually not\ntreated well\u2014when they do have a baby\nthey don't even get a chance to see if it's a boy or girl before the mother has\nwhisked it off and claimed it as her own. Kate, although outwardly sub ser vi en tone has to be to survive\u2014never gives up\nhope of finding her daughter (who, she\nfinds out, is being brought up by another\ncouple) and either overthrowing the\ngovernment or escaping from the\ncountry. She has become involved with\nan underground group working to restore\nthe country.\nEven though Kate is going through a very traumatic time the film never\nactually becomes emotional\u2014it is far too\nfactual and realistic. Reading about the\nwhole situation may seem very far\nfetched but the film makes it appear far\ntoo plausible.\nJ LW. Young Guns II\nNot normally a fan of westerns I was\npleasantly surprised by this one. Unlike\nmost sequels which seem mainly a vehicle for making a lot of money on the\nstrength of the original film's name, this\none did actually appear to have a plot\nand a purpose.\nThe film begins with a solicitor's representative meeting an old cowboy,\nwho calls himself Brushy Bill Roberts and\nclaims to be Billy the Kid. He knows he is\ndying and wants to be pardoned. He says\nhe was pardoned over seventy years\nbefore and wants this pardon to be made\nofficial. The young man pooh-poohs this\nstory because he knows the legend of\nhow Billy the Kid was assassinated and\ntherefore can't be standing before him\nnow. So the old cowboy tells him how it\nhappened...\nThe story is actually based around fact.\nOne of Billy's former friends wrote a book called 'The Real Life of Billy the\nKid'\u2014but it was a failure, and a man\nclaiming to be Billy the Kid did actually\nturn up in 1950.\nEmilio Estevez as Billy the Kid successfully combines character is ts of the\narchetypal cowboy\u2014spinning of pistols\nand lightening quick draw\u2014with a realistic portrayal of the Kid as a person\nrather than a legend.\nI did really enjoy this film it is a humourous film with a plot and also good\ndrama which will please people like\nmyself. For the western buff there's the\nobligatory gratuitous violence, frequent\nshootouts and even a little sex.\nJ LW. "

The game\nproved very tough with both sides\nsuffering a number of injuries, most of\nwhich were caused by Dave Buckle who\nleft players from both sides sprawled\naround the park. Star IC defender Yasser\nHamdi was taken to hospital with a badly\ncut lip after a collision in the first half.\nGoals from Dave Phillips and Akio\nIwase helped to make the score 2-2 at\nhalf time but Q MW scored two quick\ngoals early in the second half. IC keeper\nMartin Atherton kept shouting in order to\nmake up for the lack of the large crowd\nthat a team of this standard deserves. His\nshouting was rewarded when two goals\nfrom Keith Cordeiro and one from\nAndrew Stanniland in the last 20 minutes\nleft Q MW wondering what had hit them.\nULU Six-A Side\nSunday 21 October, Wimbledon, IC II\nbegan their annual pilgrimage to Motspur\nPark for medals and glory. IC's qualifying\ngroup comprised CH X, RF H, Golds I and\nUC II.\nUC II provided IC with an excellent\naperitif as IC won10. MAb do scoring\nthe decisive goal and T Hulbert, the fish-like keeper, doing what fish-like keepers\ndo best.\nRF H proved a nasty prawn cocktail: IC\nwith D Cook scoring twice in a21 victory. Next on the menu was Golds I, a team full of UL U players and tournament\nfavourites. However IC were very hungry\nand devoured Golds I and spat out their\nbones with contempt, with goals from S Watson and N Leonard in a20 win. IC\n' wrapped up their group, against CH X,20 with S Barry scoring twice.\nThe quarter final, against Kings II, was\nwon at a trot, S Barry scoring the winner\nto set up a semi-final clash with Golds 1\nwho had somehow sneaked through via\nthe backdoor.\nIC dished out a second helping and\nknocked them out of the tournament. D Cook scored the winner with N Leonard\nscoring arguably the goal of the\ntournament. IC had marched 'Imperiously'\ninto the final but, sadly, RCI ended their\ndreams. Fortune was against IC as a lucky goal, inspired goal keeping and\nfading light denied IC the reward their\nplay undoubtedly deserved.\nIt was a complete team effort.\n14\nSailing\nThe Firefly Class Inland Championships\nwere held at the Welsh Harp last Sunday\n(October 21). IC Sailing Club entered two\nboats into the event, notable for the very\nstrong wind which resulted in the\nmajority of competitors getting a touch\ndamp. The first race unfortunately saw\none team go swimming after rolling a bit\ntoo far whilst running, and the other\nnearly joined them, filling up their boat in\nthe process. In the afternoon the teams\ngenerally sailed better, apart from a completely successful attempt by one of\nour boats to ram one of the competitors\nby ricocheting off a motor launch, and\nwere eventually rewarded with 13th and\n16th place. A video was made of the\nCanoe\nSo far this term, the Canoe Club has had\ntwo trips.\nThe first weekend trip of the year\ninvolved seven of last year's members\ngoing up to Swaledale in North Yorkshire\nto take part in a charity paddle on behalf\nof the Samaritans, M.S., and Guide Dogs\nfor the Blind appeal.\nA well organised event was rather\nspoiled by the fact that it hasn't rained up\nthere for some time and there was no\nwater in the river. After the first day's paddling and dragging of boats over\nrocks, we decided to head for wetter\nparts.\nAfter a wild goose chase North to the\nRiver Tees we ended up on the River\nUre, near Ripon, competing for a scrap of\nriver with all canoeists who' d realised\nthat this was the only spot of white water\navailable in the area.\nLast weekend we headed for Symond's Cross Country\nThe rest of London's students were but a hedgehog in the path of the IC\nsteamroller at the first colleges' league\nmatch, held at Parliament Hill over five\nmiles. Strong men were moved to tears\nas the Imperial warriors swarmed over\nthe field to win the first division and gain\nthird place in the second and ladies\ndivisions. Resplendent in all white with\nCaptain Marvel himself, Paul Northrop,\ntaking it by the scruff and running away\nwith the individual honours by a considerable margin. Behind him a flank\nof home talent had formed, with a stunning freshman performance from\nDave Johnstone landing him in third and\ngaining victory over Frank Dudbridge and\nAlex Gaskell (5th and 8th) both of whom returning with a vengeance from the\nabyss of physical injury. Four in the top\nten was the best performance by IC in\nevent which we will try to show later in\nthe term, possibly at the bonfire party on\nNovember 3.\nOn the weekend of October 27 and 28,\nthe IC Sailing Club entered a team into\nthe Foot Trophy, one of the major team\nracing events in Britain. The new squad\nfound itself struggling against much more\nexperienced teams, but. managed to rally\nitself for a resounding victory against the\nUniversity of London second team.\nAlthough hardly a brilliant result for us,\nthe chance to see some of the country's best teams in action should pay off in our\ncoming matches against other\nuniversities.\nYat in South Wales for the first of our\nFreshers' trips. With warnings of gales\nand floods, we set off enthusiastically on\nFriday evening.\nThe weekend's paddling consisted of a leisurely paddle in the Wye Valley,\nlooking at the scenery and having the\nopportunity to practice a few skills. There\nwas also the chance to play on the rapids\nof the Yat itself. The weather was great,\nand a good time was had by all.\nThe College club is predominantly\nwhite water, and we have a number of\nexperienced paddlers who are willing to\nteach beginners, or people who've done\njust a little bit. We have pool sessions for\nthis, but a better way is to come on a trip.\nFor further details contact Keith Wilson\n(Physics 2), John Kent (Life Sci 2), or\nMartin Hillcoat (Chem Eng 3).\nliving memory, and to round off the team\nCarl Edwards grunted his way to 19th in\nhis first league race after six years at\nCollege. His infectious enthusiasm\nextended into the second team; Bill\nSkailes, Dan McQueen, Ian Williams and\nJim Watson all enjoyed massive\nimprovements on previous placings to\nlaunch the B team promotion challenge,\nwith Duncan O 'Dell and Dave Budgett\nmaking fine debut contributions. In the\nwomen's section a savage warning was\nissued to the world as a full Imperial\nteam was finally a ssem be ld and attained\nthird rank.

    "content": "REVIEWS\nThe Freshman\nBrando! Broderick! Together at last on\nthe big screen! Matthew Broderick is the\nFreshman and Marlon Brando is Carmine\nSabatini who bears a startling\nresemblance to., er-m... Broderick is new in the Big Apple and\nmanages to find a worm in the first\nnineteen minutes who makes off with all\nhis clothes, money and self-respect. (The\nlatter may not be strictly accurate). His\nfather is as nutty as something very nutty\nindeed and tighter than something we\ncan't mention on prime-time Friday fare.\nHis professor runs a film college from his\nown books, which are compulsory to the\ncourse (sound familar eh kids ?) and so\nOur Hero has no choice but to take the\nfirst job offer he gets.\nWhich, in the way of such things, is\noffered to him by the very self-same\ncrook who ripped him off in the first\nplace. Said villain introduces Brod to\nBrand; ol' 'Five Million Dollars For The\nFirst Five Minutes' plays an honest Italian\nimporter who has a poster of Mussolini\nfor sentimental reasons and a vacancy for\na nice lad to run deliveries at a thousand\ndollars a trip.\nThis poses a moral dilemma for an\nhonest young fresher since he doesn't know the nature of his goods. At this\npoint, the film, which has thus far been\nshaping up as a gentle but obvious Mob\ncomedy takes a turn for the surreal with\nthe unmentionable package. It also grows\na good deal funnier, if you have a secret\nhatred of shopping centres and petrol\nstation attendants.\nBecause this is a Matthew Broderick\nfilm it ends in gratuitous but not\nun alloyed happiness. Various complicated\nmoral issues resolve them selve neatly and\nall is well with the world.\nThe Freshman is nicely made, certainly\nnot dull, and both stars give appealing\nand credible performances. It wins big\nBrownie points from us and we saw\nMariella Frostrup in the audience.\nP.S. For those of you who may not\nhave understood the above review,\nT.A. F.G.M. would like to summarise as\nfollows : It's a good film. It's a light\ncomedy. Go and see it. AND we saw\nMariella Frostrup in the audience\n(P.P. S. Why don't we get crap films any\nmore ?)\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine\nAnd A Bag Of Fish, Please.\nThe\nEnchantment\nThe Enchantment (Japanese with English\nsubtitles) is billed as an 'ultra-modern film\nnoir'. Very catchy, I'm sure. The plot\nconcerns a psychiatrist (played by a remarkably western looking Japanese\nmodel/actor\u2014Masao Kusakari) who\nbecomes involved with a mysterious (and,\nquite naturally, beautiful) patient. She\nhappens to have a serious multiple\npersonality problem,, on top of which she\nholds great and dark secrets in her\nheart(s) etc, etc.\nUnfortunately, though the plot may\ntwist and turn, the film rattles a little too\nmuch\u2014it is not quite as smooth as the\nmakers must have hoped. It's not too hot\non the noir bit either. You can't just have\na load of shadows and say: well boys,\nhere's a film noir. It lacks the\npsychological depth, the tension, the\natmosphere of the genre.\nAll this apart, however, there are some\n'nice bits'. There is a nice piece of irony\nin the opening and closing sequences (the\npsychiatrist is seen in the first shot of the\nmovie to have nearly cured a taxi-driver\nof his obsession with an ex-girlfriend,\nwhile at the end it is the kwa ck who\nis...well, you can guess). The relationship\nbetween the psychiatrist and his girlfriend\nis also quite interesting.\nThe Enchantment runs at the ICA until\nNovember 19.\nlft.\nDr. Faustus English National Opera, London Coliseum, 20th October.\nA cross between '42nd Street', 'The\nRocky Horror Show' and an amateur\nGilbert and Sullivan? That was one\nverdict on the ENO's revival of Busoni's Doctor Faust.\nFrom the moment the curtain rises to\nreveal Faust sitting at a modern\nexecutive's desk, wearing a modern suit\nand towered over by piles of filing\ncabinets arranged like a city skyscraper\nskyline, the audience knows it is in for an\nupdating of the sixteenth century\nmorality tale to the twentieth century.\nIn fact the whole design lacks cohesion:\nostensibly set in the early twenties, with\nthe women at the court of Parma\nwearing beaded 'flapper' dresses, the\nchorus are dressed like thirties mafia and\nHelen of Troy appears to have wandered\nin from the Cole Porter musical next\ndoor. Mephistopheles' transformation into\nFaust's stage assistant, wearing pink\nbasque, red garter and red stilettos was\nobviously meant to parody the magician's assistant's role, but merely ended up\ncamp.\nThese points would be merely irritating if\nit were not that the set itself, dragged out\nof mothballs for this revival of a1986 production, looks on the point of collapse.\nHowever, the staging does show some\nnice touches, for example, the triangular\nfloor consists of strips of rubber through\nwhich heads, hands and bodies can\nappear and disappear, but which can also\nbe walked across like a solid floor.\nAnother disappointing area is the\nchoreography. It was difficult to tell\nwhether similar movements were meant\nto be un synchronise d or were simply\nsloppily performed. The ENO are\napparently unable to stage convincing\nlooking crowd scenes: the chorus seems\nto mill randomly, exhibiting no emotion\nor sense.\nWhat is good about this production? The\norchestra, under the direction of Anthony Beaumont, play brilliantly as always, even\nif they sometimes drown out the singers.\nAlan Opie's Faust is excellent in such a challenging role. He has many protracted\nmonologues and is on stage for almost all\nthree hours of the opera. Graham Clark,\nrecreating the role of Mephistopheles\nfrom the original production, is also a fine\nperformer.\nThe direction shows some fine insight\nduring parts of the production, but varies\nbetween frenetic, seemingly pointless\nactivity and moments of visual banality.\nHowever it allows the opera's theme, that\n'human beings are responsible for their\nown actions and may not ascribe even\ntheir crimes and achievements to either\nGod or the Devil', to develop through\ngood use of repeated imagery.\nThis is certainly not a good introduction\nto opera for the uninitiated. It is perhaps\nonly fit for those who wish to be\nchallenged. This would have been far\nbetter as a concert performance than as a visual mess on stage.\nDoctor Faust continues in repertoire until\nNovmber 15th. Liz W. "

Union Office\nFriday lunchtime\nA Cosmic Ray and Solar Particle detector,\npart of which was built at Imperial, was\nswitched on by remote control on the\n23rd October. It is aboard the space\nprobe Ulysses, more than 18 million km from Earth. Two days later Imperial's magneto meter was made operational by a signal that took over a minute to reach\nthe probe.\nThe magneto meter is a highly sensitive\nmagnetic field detector, capable of\nmeasuring fields up to a million times\nweaker than the Earth's field. It will study\nthe large scale structure of magnetic field\nlines in the heliosphere.\nAll of the observations of the sun's field\nhave so far been confined to the ecliptic\nplane. The observations made with\ninstruments from Imperial College and the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory will provide\ndata to test the three dimensional models\nproposed by theorists. This may help us\nto understand the eleven year solar\nactivity cycle. Related to the Sun's magnetic phenomena this is believed to\naffect weather patterns on Earth.\nImperial's other instrument on board, a set of two atomic particle detectors, will\nmeasure fluxes in energetic protons\nreleased from the sun in solar flares. The\ninstrument, part of a complex of detectors\nprovided by an international consortium\nof scientific institutes, will investigate the\nway in which the heliosphere, and in\nparticular the sun, can act as a highly\nefficient particle accelerator.\nChaos\n'Chaos in Biological Systems' will be\ndiscussed by Professor R.M. May on\nThursday 7th November. The lecture will\nbe held at 1.15 in Physics Lecture\nTheatre 1. Everybody welcome.\nFire\nFire broke out in Bernard Sunley last\nMonday when a grill caught light. Chris\nDonegan, a past warden of Bernard\nSunley, said that a student discovered the\nfire and put out the flames with an\nextinguisher. He said that there had been\na large amount of smoke produced which\nset of the alarms at around midnight.\nMr Donegan said that the cooker\ninvolved had been examined by the\nCollege electrician and had been passed\nas safe. It was now back in use.\nMr Donegan said that there had been a good response' to the alarm. He commented that there had been a fire\nalarm test only that morning at 8.00.\n3\n\n"

Yes, Rose Of Avalanche have gone the\nsame way as the Soup Dragons to\nachieve commercial prestige...but it\nworks.\nEven the first track blights away the\ngloom, in Your Light'sOn, the bene fact i al purchaser is pleased by a liberal dosage\nof the traditional indie wah-wah and hip\nbeat, man. As the cover implies, a suitable concoction of Loop and Primal\nScream, in precise quantities, may total\nRose.\nMuch jolliness ensues. The vocals may\nbe an acquired taste, but somebody had\nto sing. Make It Right is bound to do well\nwhen released, and they ARE looking for\ninspiration, honest. It's a happy thing.\nSuddenly and daunting ly, the mood\nString A' Beads LP\nthickens. The acoustics strike wondrously.\nEven the voice is listenable.\nOoh, String'A 'Beads is the title track\nand deservedly so. Rose take the recipe\nand define beat, bends and bop pines s. Shake the ceiling. The whole is drowned\nin unashamed conviction, no concessions,\nno defeat. They seem to continue for\never. The rest merely glances by, a remnant from their earlier days. Having\nfailed the bop-beat scene, they now\ntrespass on New Model Army acoustics\nand clich es of typical loves, lost, held and\nlost again, sob, sob. The last track, Be True To Your Love is memorable, but\nnever quite gets there, and ends in a frustration of noise and wah-wah.\nEven so, they seem set to destroy any\nmega-basses still intact after the dance\ntakeover.\nSJH\nAlien Sex Fiend \u2014Camden Underworld\nAlien Sex Fiend, as you might guess from\nthe name, do not boast a reputation as\nthe most tasteful of bands. Their d if in it ive box-set contains a plastic dog-waste\nsi mula crum( commemorating their first\nrelease which flaunted the real version of\nsame upon its sleeve). This, and the\nphotos which adorn the gate fold of their\ndouble live LP, did nothing to reassure\nme, so it was with some trepidation that I found myself dragged to their first UK dates for a while.\nAt first glance the stage did nothing to\nquell my doubts, swathed as it was in\ncotton cobweb and amputee Barbies.\nNick Robertson & Slice\nThis acoustic offering shows precious little\ntalent. It initially sounds quite pleasant,\nShow Me A Sign 12\"\ninspired perhaps by early Housemartins;\nbut the singer hasn't got anything of\ninterest to say. The music is hardly\noriginal, making each song sound, at best,\nunmemorable. In an effort to relieve the\ntedium, Nick deploys gimmicks, such as\nscatting, but his voice is simply not up to\nit. The title track thus ends up as a complete mess. One song even ends up\nwith the old pub rock trick of speeding\nthe tempo up and up while The Flame\nsounds like a bad copy of a Tracy\nChapman song.\nUnless the group can develop an\noriginal sound of their own( assuming\nthey can find one) they will remain as\ncreators of slightly annoying background\nmusic.\nRel\nAfter much belching of dry ice and not\ninconsiderable amounts of audience\nanticipation the band finally took to the\nstage. The guitarist looks 'normal'\nenough. The percussion/keyboardist, clad\nin ragged lab coat, is otherwise. Mrs\nFiend, also on keyboards, is downright\nattractive in purple velvet. Nik Fiend...on\nstage, at last, is the least pleasant-looking\nman I have ever seen; white faced,\ntar ten trouser ed and puke-green Riddler\ncoat.\nThankfully the stage is too small for Nik\nto engage in his full antics and the music\nmore than makes up for it. ASF play a fusion of HM distort guitar and hard-edged dance percussion and keyboard\nwhich went down well with the audience,\nmost of whom were die-hard aficionados.\nWhile the songs are formula rise d to a certain degree there's enough variation to\nkeep the gig from turning into a straightforward industrial dance race, the tempo\nrising and falling through the BPM scale.\nDuring the hour-and-a half set most of the\nold favourites get a dusting off (Gef Into\nIt, Manic Depression and (ugh!) Sample\nMy Sausage) and the newer songs are\naired with a fair degree of panache for a first time out. EST...Trip to the Moon and\nBoneshaker Baby both moved the crowd,\nthe first as a long, drawn-out synth riff\nand the latter as a straight rock 'n' roller.\nIf you enjoy dance music with a little\nmore melody and power and you can\ncope with cut-price Alice Cooper visuals\nASF might be worthy of your attention.\nTheir latest album, Curse, is available\nnow, and they tour again next year.\n(This review has been written according\nto the new hip 'n' trendy editorial policy).\nStone.\n\n"

    "content": "Greame chats to the Unstoppable Sex Machine.\nCarter Interview MUSIC\n'Hello. Have you got a tape recorder?' He\nsmiled sincerely and his manner was very\npolite. Nice man this Jim Bob, 1 thought. I did have a tape recorder so we got on\nwith the interview.\n'Is it alright if its just me., he's in a bad\nmood, probably just smash your\nwalkman!..'\nJim Bob and Fruit Bat, the two\nmembers of Carter The Unstoppable Sex\nMachine, were in Brixton playing The\nFridge. Practically a home gig (they lived\nabout two miles away), it comes towards\nthe end of a gruelling UK tour.\n'It's just his name., his name is Carter\nand I started taking the piss, about the\nsex machine, and it just stuck.'\nAlthough Jim Bob generally sings the\nsongs, both members demand equal\nattention on stage, and yet they both lose\nto the adrenaline pumped music they\nthrash out. This is high technology guitar\npop, set against a manic backing tape of\ndrums, keyboards, bass and samples.\nEach of their guitars pierce through this\nmelange with over driven riffs of such\nhype that even the stiffs groove down.\n'Yeah, we lay the patterns down on a... yeah, good guess, as Alesis..' (a drum\nmachine for those not in the know) '..and\nthen go into the studio, add other sounds\nand the rest of it. We do use samples but\nless and less now.'\nThe way their sound goes together\nmakes it hard to characterise Carter.\n'Well, we've been compared to so\nmany, The Clash., even the Pet Shop\nBoys.' I myself can find no adequate\ncomparison although The Shamen provide\na similar sort of stage show. Strobes and\nlights all add to the situation to create an\naudio visual experience.\n'Yeah, tonight we will use their\nprojectors here. Basically because they\nwon't let us use our backdrops.\nApparantly they're not properly fire\nproofed. We know because the stage\nmanager set fire to them. He SET FIRE to\nthem just to pro ove a point, w anker. We're going to set fire to him later!' This\nunique style also gives them a universal\naudience, from the indie biker's jacket to\nthe dance y Converse boot.\n'I don't think it actually existed, it was\njust thought up by somebody. You can't liken The Happy Mondays to James or\nThe Stone Roses or The Inspirals. There\nare bands around, like The Charlatans,\nwho are influenced by one of those four\nand then other bands have copied them.\nThey're copying the wrong ones.'\n'The acid thing? Don't really have time,\nsometimes dance to it.'\nCarter's new single, Any Time, Any\nPlace, Anywhere, is the first released\nsince signing to Rough Trade. Already it\nsnip - <!\n\" * ' 3 i. is high up in the Indie charts at Number\n4 and is all set to storm the Gallop poll.\nThe single has been given good reviews\nand Jim Bob tells me that the video is\nexcellent, though unfortunately is not\nreceiving much airplay.\n'We do want to do well in the national\ncharts. We want to go on Top Of The\nPops. It's one of our aims at the moment.'\nAfter talking to him, this didn't surprise\nme. Jim Bob is actually quite a mild,\nconventional chap, despite the impression\nhe gives on stage.\nIt's obvious Carter don't want to be just\nanother hip indie band all their lives, and\njudging by the reception from the mixed\ncrowd at The Fridge, I don't think that\nwill be a problem.\nThe tour has been very hard work for\nthe two lads and their crew (especially\n'Fat Bastard' who is hailed with a half full\nbeer cans at the start of each gig) and\nthey will be glad to wind it up this week\nin Canterbury.\nIt's then back into the studio to record\nthe album for Christmas release, at which\ntime another mini-tour is planned, visiting\nonly their favourite venues.\nAs the Top Of The Pops theme blurted\nout their entrance, Carter came on stage\nto a rapturous welcome and quickly went\nabout the task of blowing everyone away.\nClutching my tape recorder (which\nhadn.t worked) I watched the steady\nstream of stage divers jump about around\nCarter and noticed that Fruit Bat never\nonce stopped smiling. He was loving it\nand I thought about what Jim Bob had\nsaid. I disagree. I can't imagine such nice\npeople wanting to smash my walkman!\n'Students., no I don't hate them., used\nto but I realised it was pointless.' What\nabout those who tid d ly wink down Oxford\nStreet? ' Oh yeah, that sort., yeah, they're\nwan kers!' Graeme\n\n"
