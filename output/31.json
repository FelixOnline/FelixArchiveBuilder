    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nTHE FASHIONS OF THK DECADE\nor THE NEW GARB AGE Dear dir, In view of a recent appeal for sartorial differentiation between the student and the Civil Servant, may I suggest that\" Felix\" should further the cause Dy the offer of a month's free subscription to the first student( or professor) to wear idA UV S buttons on his yellow waistcoat. The idea might well be extended. I suggest the ii tiU VE brim less bowler, with a motif of rampant, white hammers and sickles, to be worn in the bar and the Upper Dining Hall. Rainbow cords should be worn by\" the hound i bout town\"; each cord of a different colour, and the colour intensity to be normally distributed about the Knee.\" Trousers should be neatly creased to port and starboard, not as THEY have it, to bow and stern. Shoes should be semi* o rogue d, wedged, monk ed, and block toed, with leather in plaited yellow and white, red and silver, or MAUVE and white. Ties should be of fine plaited, coloured, leather strips. Awake, Arise, and Differentiate thyself. Let3 leg ance and originality be the keynote)\" Arturo\" Dear Sir, So the Guilds* want a new tie. I can well imagine the contrasting ideas. The sober minded will want something regiment ally striped, whereas the more artistic members will favour a fetching bom. The smarter set possibly had a yellow silk affair with' City& Guilds' College painted by hand in luminous paint in mind, and others might prefer something crested for their current girlfriends to admire. And I what would I like? It doesn't really matter when you wear a tartan shirt. Yours etc. D.J. W.(C& GU)\nEAST & WEST\nThe present, series of open meetings to discuss the International situation was given an excellent start on Thursday Jen.24 th, by Prof. Betts, Masaryk Professor of Central European History, speaking on\" The Intellectual Assumptions governing the attitude of the East to the West.\" In a brilliant lecture Prof. Betts brought out forcibly how the actions end statements of the West v. ere interpreted by the East not critically, on their merits, but whether or not agreed with the\" basic truths\" of Communism, u om munis m being an all embracing religion Faith is substituted for Reason. Liberty, Truth and Justice while difficult to define; in our world lose all meaning in a materialistic one,' EAST OH west Be ec. is best, expediency is the keynote. Peace while it is convenient, otherwise war. The discussion, containing abroad representation of views, was sufficiently lively for the majority to stay until9.30. p.m. Unfortunately the remarkable objectivity shown by the speaker was not shared by many participants. The decision to hold the meeting after supper in order to give an opportunity for an unhurried discussion was a welcome in ovation and the attendance of forty supported this experiment. We look forward to hearing Dr. Doreen Warr in er consider the ideals, structure, and actions of the West,on February7 th. The S. C.M. are to be congratulated for organising this series of lectures. iC WITH MY LITTLE!

Applicants please use form DDT12 X.P HC ENIX Owing to an unusually favourable configuration of the constellations( with Tau ru3in the ascendancy)' Phoenix Review195051' has appeared. The first obvious criticism to be made of this issue of our distinguished contemporary is that it is three months late in seeing the light of day. The' Review1 is, as I see it, intended primarily to present a summary of the preceding year's activities of the clubs and societies of the College, both as a record for' old stage rs' and as an Introduction for the fresher s; consequently, It should have appeared at the beginning of tho session. The editorial board should surely consider whether it is good policy to issue a copy more than half of which has lost much of its interest and topical it y. This maybe a suitable time to raise the wider issue of what' Phoenix' is to be a glorified school magazine as is the present Issue or a periodical of some literary and Intellectual p retention. I have no doubt that the aims of the board are high, but that the necessary material is not forthcoming from the members of the college. It Is to be hoped, however, that the two remaining issues of this session will do something to reestablish the necessity of' Phoenix' to the life of the College. "

    "content": "FELIX MODERATION Icy minds racing straight from the pole, playing fields inches deep in crisps now, looking for all the world a white Christmas, could not daunt those hardy players who proved once again capable of adapting themselves to any conditions. On the blustering day when England just failed to withstand the invasion from the West, convincing successes were gained over formidable opponents. The Rug ger team beating Wasps Vandals(135) fi> r the first time after outplaying them in every phase of the game, and last Saturday the Vets, who knocked out the Rug ger team in the first round of the cup last year, were outrun to a score of113. There is not ruthin the rumours that skis will be worn for the next match. Unfortunately both the Soccer and Hockey teams were beaten but not outplayed in the U.L. Cup. With such a good start to the second half season it would be a great pity if the standard of play was to fall because players are not up to form. No sports men would be willingly jeopardize his team's chances by not being fit and would be ashamed to have to explain a poor game by reference to festivities the night before. As there is a succession of carnival st nd dances in the near future, all of which depend for their su cpe s s upon the numbers and the so ir it present moderation and sleep, gentlemen.

It seems certain that the men's first will head their section of the League, and should beat King's first who seem to be the likely winners of the others eot ion. These don d men' steam had one good victory in beating a slightly weakened King's first team. We have played Cambridge Uni V.,\"A'' team at home and were narrowly beaten54 and this was without the assistance of our captain F.S. Lau. There will be a return fixture with Cambridge and a home one with Oxford in the very near future. The captain of our team, F.S. Lau, is also captain of the University of London Badminton Club, and this year succeeded in gaining the U. A.U. singles title. We have four or five members in the U.L. club and there is little doubt that the club is stronger now than it has been for many\nyears past and should keep up its high standard for atleast the next couple of years.12 th Jan..19 th26 th J an.nar riers SOCCER. U.L. C URI.C.0 U.C.1.I. C.' sU.L. Cup bid ended at Berry lands last Saturday when a valiant I.C. XI refused to be overwhelmed by a very strong U.C. side. For two thirds of the match I.C. were penned in their own half, fighting a stubborn rear guard action against a fast moving forward line, which included four of the regular U.L. side, brilliantly backed up by a half backline which included Godfrey, the U.L. captain at centre half. The success of U.C. can be attributed to this one man w hp time and again broke up the I.C. attacks, at the same time feeding his forwards with an accuracy rarely seen in college football. It was fitting that he should score the goal which decided the matcha brilliantly taken free kick from fully twenty five yards, which was in the back of the net before the I.C. goalkeeper had time to move. The game was played in traditional cup tie fashion fast robust tackling and grimly determined defensive play on both sides. U.C. were no doubt shaken at the end of the goalless first half b}a defence which would not crack even under the intense pressure which their forwards were capable of laying on and on three occasions when the U.C. keeper was\nbrought to his knees by shots from Hodge and C len shaw. Indeed at the end of this periodI.C. may well have been in the lead. For the first fifteen minutes of the second half I.C. dominated th a. play and came very close to scoring on several occasions} but then the game\nswung again to U.C.' sf p.v our, resulting in Godfrey' s goal. Time was played out with I.C. defending grimly an a attacking spasmodically. It can be recorded\" I.C. lost but honours were HOCKEY I.C.2U. C.0 On Wednesday23 rd J a xu ary I.C. avenged their unlucky defeat in the U.L. Cup. Both sides were roughly equally weakened by the loss of University and examination bound players, but with much of their brilliant( albeit so far unrecognised) talent remaining, the home side took the field, anticipating the sweetness of vengeance. Pur slow, graciously presented the opposing captain with choice of ends and proceeded to prove his wisdom by promptly scoring a scintillating goal, The remainder of the first half was occupied with dour midfield play with Power and Pur slow thrust ful in attack, and Pur slow and Power dogged in defence. Gillett, in the under worked rear division was occasionally seen on the field, between sprints off to remove yet another sweater. The second half honours got oI.C. who survived initial pressure by U.C. and then gradually took more\nand more of the play. A second goal came i rom ia long corner cleverly stroked by Pur slow, and Jarvis cracked home ahead highs norte r.J. G. Smith was impressive in this, his first match and throughout the game well supplied the. necessary ammunition for the Pur slow Power spearhead. cj. p.RC S. VR.S. M. The first match for the newly awarded Stephenson Cup for inter college hockey, was played between the R.C.S. and R.S. M.atH arlington on16 th Jan. The R.C.S. finally won a closely contested game by3 goals to2. Play for the first20 minutes was concentrate u in the R.S. M.25 area but determined defensive play by the Mines in which White was outstanding, prevented the R.C.S. from scoring. On the odd occasion when the R.S. M. broke through their forwards were fast moving and dangerous. The R.S. to. forced a corner, which although weakly taken, was not well cleared, and a hard shot from Hunt opened the scoring. Shortly after halftime Alderson scored again for the Mines after a defensive blunder in which almost all the R.C.S. defence were concerned. However throughout the game the more experienced R.C.S. team had had the lion's s ft i are of the play and finally Pur slow, standing in the goal mouth, found the ball a this feet and had no difficulty in scoring. A goal from Weight after a fine solo run made t.he score equal and Pur slow scored the winning goal for the R.C.S. after good work by Sherwood on the left wing.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nf point ELECTION OF PRESIDENTS\nE ow many students knowhow the President of I.C.i selected? The procedure is given in the Blue Book presented to you on first entering the college. The election campaign is run very quietly. A nomination r or mis posted on the Council noticeboard early in June where any Union member may be proposed. Just before the Joint Council Meeting the notice is removed, and the Joint Council decides who shall be our President. It has not always been like this. In the very early days of I.C. the President was the student President of Guilds, R.C.S.,& nines in rotation, and in s ffef et therefore he Has elected by the students. Later he was elected by the so called\" Students Committee\", and still later by the Students Finance Committee, the forerunner of Council. Apart from the very early days of\" Presidents in Rotation,\" the President has been the chairman of the committees which run Union affairs, and cam not be said to be the leader of the Union. Why should we have this system? It would surely be to the advantage of the Union to elect the President by ballot among Union members. In favour of the present system it is said that firstly Council members are more acquainted sith the nominees and are thus more in a position to form a correct judgement than the ordinary student. Secondly it is held that if ordinary students voted their President they would tend to vote for the man from their own college. Thirdly it is thought that politics might enter into the election if students had the vote. The first point must be discussed with a view to what kind of President the Union needs. Do we\nneed a President who is mainly the chairman of committees, Council in particular, and in effect the representative of Authority to us; or do we\nneed a President who is our leader \u2014 . our reo resent at ive to the Governors? The second seems the more likely, and can only be obtained by the students electing the President. This President could then be certain of the sympathy and backing of the majority of students. For the second point we must ask ourselves:\" Is Council above intercollegiate rivalries?\" If so, why do supporters of a candidate from one college try to get a proposer from one of the other colleges? The third argument in favour of the present system is that politics are brought into the election campaigns of other Colleges, This, it is held, is the worsts in of all but surely this happens here under the present system. Would Council put consideration of politics aside if a nominee were a Communist? Would they vote for him without any consideration of his political views. In summing up a man's character his political views have a very important contribution and it would be a great mistake to leave them out altogether. This does not meant Ji at politics should be the major issue of an election that also would be a great mistake. In favour of having the President elected by ballot is the advantage the t it would stimulate an interest in Union affairs by those we are wont to call Brown B agger s.Even they, when presented with the ballot papers could feel that they play quite an important part in Union affairs. Also, we could then say that he was our President, end not just a chairman and spokesman of committees.\" Mer p\".

In st. Ve r.Ing.) A most Interesting Engineering Project was pat before students undergoing tutorial in Miss J. Brown' scoff eo house. The author proposed a bridge, of ingenious design, to extend from City& Guilds College to the coffee hou3 e. The basic layout of the structure is that of an extruded tubular see3 aw, inclining downwards from the roof of C.&G. to Miss Brown's premises during the initial quarter of each working hour. The inclination would be reversed for the final quarter of each hour. The pivot, or rocking pier, will be mounted upon the Geological Museum roof. The foot walk will consist of many per f oct ly light f riot loa less rollers( each of9\" outer diameter, at8\" spacing). No additional supply of energy will therefore be required on either journey, once the initial potential energy has oe o.i obtained. The gradient of1 in52 is calculated to impart a terminal velocity at th oc off eo house counter sufficient to penetrate to the front of any normal queue. The roadway facilitates the passage of otherwise' mobile vehicles to and from coffee. The tubular bridge structure, or Schl lt t bahn stahl, will enclose road and footway. The bridge will have two outer surfaces one of the usual sulphur i zed brick and one of etched and polished molybdenum ferri tic steel for use once re roni al occasions. The cost will be borne by the Union. One questioner, enquiring how entrance to the bridge was achieved on the return journey( the entrance being some 162 feet above the coffeehouse roof), was referred to Braun h03en's paper on\" Hoch f re que n zte eh nik in Schau kel walz erp rob le rce\". The customary question:\" What about the Russians?\" was discussed at length, it being too late to return to more material lectures. A vote of thanks to Mr. Pr bl sk was withdrawn, due to his failure to pay for the audience's coffee. X. K.G. P. V7rr77777y77zr?7??777^\nWATER M6 CHARS ESF ROW BOTTOM OF BUCKET INTO OR.

Sadly missed by all her friends, Joan' s departure will be most deeply felt by the students of Sil wood Park, where she has been a keen and active chairman of their committee and also by I.

A. dances will no longer decorate the Union Entrance Hall, a.s Joan has left i.i th out passing on the secret of\" three dimensional\" advertising. p.r r\"V L<f) Ju u Froai our It us ic Correspondent. l he editor has sug^e e ted that articles on the subject of the musical life of the college should appear occasionally these being, not criticisms of performances, but commentaries on the current activities of the various societies. With this in view it may be as well to outline the main branches of the I.C. musical Tree a siu. stands at the moment.\nWe have a choir of some 85 voices which rehearses and performs under the baton of Dr. Reginald Jacques. The size of the choir makes it suitable for works not often performed by large choral societies and thus the choir concerts are usually of great interest to allmusic lovers. At present Haydn' s\" The Creation\" and Bach' scant at a\"Bide with Us\" are being prepared for a concert later in the term. The orchestra is suffering from an acute shortage of brass players and this factor severely limits the choice of works to be tackled. With a certain amount of judicious importing of local talent from B.C. It, some of the shortages have been overcome and at the moment Mendelssohn' s\" Italian\" symphony is being rehearsed, together with a Slavonic Rhapsody of Dvorak. The Thursday Concerts have a good following with often\" standingroom only\". A wide range of works is performed at a high standard this combination making the concerts one of I.C.'s greatest musical assets. The recorded music club is dormant at present owing to the lack of a suitable gramophone. The\nrecord library still exists so that with a little initiative this activity could be revived, bringing with it the possibility of inviting authorities to give illustrated talks on various topics the one\npart of I.C. musical life which is completely lacking at the moment.\n( C.&G. electrical dept. please copy).

IMPERIAL COLLEGE31 JANUARY1952[ Y DOINGS AT THE UNIVERSITY JAMAICA RELIEF BALL On February8 th. the University of London Union is organising a Grand Carnival Ball at Senate House in aid of the Jamaica Hurricane Relief Fund, in addition to the dancing in the Marble Hall there will be a Rum Fair in the adJoining Deller Hall, consisting of sideshows etc. contributed by each college. At11.30 pm. a Mardi Gras procession is to beheld, In wh i oh colleges are invited to enter a tableau formed by a team of up toten, the theme to be in keeping with the whole evening. This procession will be judged by Katherine Dunham( now appearing at: the Cambridge Theatre), atrophy being awarded to the best entry. In addition there will be the usual attractions, auctions, raffles and aRum bola. This is really a large scale draw with thirty prizes, including a typewriter, a vacuum cleaner, and bottles of drink( potent and impotent). Tickets for the Carnival, which lasts from9 pm. to2 am., may be obtained from the U.L. U. Office price257 single, or to members of U.L.U.15/,I tis hoped to raise \u00a3 1 0 0 0 .\nThe R.C.S. Entertainments Committee' regrets that the U.L. U. Carnival clashes with their' Rodeo1, but arrange mem ents had been made for this before the U.L. U. details we tre circulated, and could not be altered. DRAM. SOC. NEWS Not to be outdone by the blazer men of the college, the Dram. So c.are going, on tour' during the long vacation. They are hoping to put on >\na three act play at Cheltenham for a week's run. If the arrangements are successfully completed, I.CD.3. will be the first college production to play there. The producer will be Bernard latter, who will be remembered as To m.D' Are y, the M.P., in the Christmas production.( See photograph in the last FELIX). Our Joining in this venture, which started last year with the appearance of several productions by University societies, should not only spread the college reputation, but such experience in a'live' theatre should bean invaluable help to the society. FELIX MAKEUP We received excellent support last Sunday more than we expected because we omitted to request those coming to sign upon the notice In the Union hall. This will be there for next week; cm\nit are spaces for each shift to book up. SIL WOOD ON COUNCIL The position of SILWOOD PARK in I.C.h as received a further boost from Council. Until recently they had only an observer at the Council meetings. Now it is proposed to make the observer a representative with the status of an Officer of the Union, thus bringing the number of Officers upton in e.Ast his change involves amendments to Union byelaws the measure will have to be ratified by t wp Union General Meetings before it takes effect. The representative will be the Chairman of the Sil wood Park Committee. MORE REFECTORY FACILITIES\nLatest reports from the Refectory Committee indicate that the problem of efficiency is being tackled in a businesslike manner. In future tea, coffee, toast and marmalade will be made\navailable to nonresidents in the morning up to9.45 am., but complete breakfasts will not be generally available due to rationing difficulties. On February16 th.an experimental Snack Bar will be opened in the Lower Dining Hall during the Hop from9 to10.30 pm. If this proves successful, it is intended to open It every Saturday evening of the term. It is hoped that this service will fill along felt want of members of the Union. We have to rectify a misleading statement which appeared in the last FELIX: applications for the use of Ayrton Hall should be made to the Union Office. After approval the forms will be passed on to the relevant authority. UL. U. DEBATES This term it is Intended to hold U.L. U. debates every Friday as far, as it is possible in an attempt to make debating a regular and acknowledged part of the life of the University. The first motion of the term was' That this House believes that the Conservative Party regained power by hoodwinking the electorate.' It was proposed by a Labour candidate unsuccessful at the last election and seconded by a student official of the University Labour Society. Exactly the same combination of forces representing the Tories op \u00bbo sed the motion. The speeches from the platform were good despite their resemblance to election manifestos and there was en excellent response, numerically, from the floor although many of the speeches were irrelevant to the motion without having the justification of wit. A welcome innovation was what might be called' audience participation' or. since the motion was a political one, merely he c ii ling. The President, who was in the chair, gave interrupt ers a freehand as long as the speaker was not seriously inconvenienced. This sort of intervention, when kept within reasonable bounds, improves the atmosphere of the debate and prevents speakers from getting av/ay with outrageous statements. After two and a half hours of debating the House divided and the r. \u00bb tion was defeated by96 votes to68. LATE NEWS\nMonday Evening. The Evening Standard published a review on London University.

WEAR NE UNDERGRADUATE LIFE\nLife at college for the student newly arrived from school or the services is recognised as\" both j a test and a contribution in his development. The freedom at the principal^ institutions of this University is probably our popular characteristic much misrepresented in its rare appearance in newspapers. In fact it means that, if we accept that* the function of a university is the mastery and advancement of k nov/ ledge, we must leave its members( i.e. Professors, Lecturers and students) to study as they think best. However the entrant with the grasshopper mind may take college as an intellectual Holiday Camp. We have all known the sad stories at examination time of the jack of all trades, who is musician, mountaineer, politician, playwright and more at all times( though he is rarely the lover or the drinker). We should recognise him as the' terrible example' our Victorian elders would propound. Union life comprises a th let io clubs, faculty societies, debates and dances; amongst the other complementary activities music often occupies a specie' place, with the dramatic society close in popular interest. The student not generally interested in all these to some extent, should find a logical bias in one direction. No suggestion was made to us on entering college to plan our life here and to strike a balance between the inclination of the dilettante and the dutiful: as well as a sport or equivalent communal interest, most engineers should be concerned with their Engineering Society, zoologists with their Natural History Society etc., running them according to student needs; and at scientific I.C. each of these has the special opportunity tc attract the whole college. Esoteric lectures are better written and read than discussed.* In some of the L.C.C'. s Polytechnics granted University recognition, the atmosphere is more con cio us of registers controlling attendance from nine to fi we everyday. Facilities and familiarity with research are rare. These institutions provide great opportunities for Londoners to get excellent straightforward instruction for internal degrees and diplomas, possibly to the immediate detriment in competition of the graduate as we\nmean him. A comparison of these, Oxford and Cambridge, and us, with the' civic' universities, is given by\" Red brick University\", published recently by Penguin Books; and of which this is in part a review. mS.

PROFILEB RIA NW PUR SLOW FELIX Pkoto\nF or over half a decade the cloisters of I.C. have dinned to the hobnailed o lump of those who, having devoted their best years to His Majesty' s pleasure, rel in gul shed the command of battalions and brigades to assume government of clubs and societies. But in more recent times have come\nto be heard increasingly the patter of tiny feet as the trickle of ink stained school brats has streamed and swollen tinto the torrent that is almost upon us. Brought in on the first wave was British Way and Purpose Pur slow. Once he had shaken the foam from his face( and a more than metaphorical connection between Brian and froth rises naturally to the mind, of all that know him) he set to work, pausing only for the swift game of hookey, to fortify himself with a degree in Physics. From this safe but in sanitary position he turned his attention to the exploration of new territory. The now legend ry Joe MoC all, who had gathered about him a stalwart band of young things, selected Brian to be his successor as Captain of R.C.S. Hockey and democratically nominated him for the post. After an abortive bash at the Presidential Heights of R.C.S., Brian gave a glimpse of his mettle by agreeing to serve the Union as Secretary to President Hobnailed Haskell. Emerging at the end of last year a fully debauched licentiate of squalid school of Union politics he was so obviously returned unopposed amid scenes of un parallelled and orgiastic torpor. A precisely analogous evolution In the backwoods of H arlington and Committee Room \" A\" had also brought him first the Secretary ship and then the Captaincy of the I.e. Hockey Club. Other Prof i lists, restrained by bounds of common decency have made no more than passing reference to the amour o us proclivities of their subjects, but we are governed by no such scruples. Encouraged by early successes at home Brian swept through Scandinavia and the Low Countries in two successive campaigns and in a third laid waste the Iberian Peninsula. But it most not be supposed there are no quiet moments in Brian' s meteoric career as the avant guard e of the younger generation: moments of research into the frenzy induced in gas molecules when given the hot wire treatment; moments devoted to investigating the arrangements sustaining the trousers of the President of Guilds; moments of abandoned cross ruffing bur led deep in the Hostel night; or moments alcohol lc ally expanded Into\" monumental evenings\"? As the R.C.S. and its President toiled on the towpath last Morphy, none knew that the voice of B. W.P. recorded in one of these quieter moments, was being broadcast to the astonished masses of Asia in an Inter Varsity Brain sTru3t. It is the intention of Wolfe Pur slow to take the American Continent by storm starting with Canada when he has added a Ph.D. to his armament In this enterprise we are confident that Brian will go as far as the flexible laws of an expanding economy will permit him. Brian is most remarkable in that he is so refreshingly unremarkable. What he achieve she achieves by assiduous application of unremitting energy. We all wish him and America well.* See Felix No.16, p.4.(26/1/51). DRAMATIC SOCIETY FEB 2 3 rd. \u2022 HARLEQUIN A DE DRAMATIC CORRESPONDENT wanted for FELIX. "
