    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nA High\nSense of\nDrama\nLong Day's Journey Into Night by Eugene\nO 'Neill, directed by Jon Gulliver and\nperformed by Imperial College Dramatic\nSociety in the Union Concert Hall,\nWednesday March 16 to Saturday March\n19.\nEugene O'Ne ill, the only American playwright ever to receive the Nobel Prize for\nLiterature, is the author of such masterpieces\nas Electra, Desire Under The Elms and The\nIceman Cometh. Imbued with the tragic sense\nof life, he aimed for a contemporary drama\nthat had its roots in the most powerful of\nancient Greek tragedy\u2014a drama that could\nrise to the emotional heights of Shakespeare.\nImperial College Dramatic Society are\npresenting O 'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into\nNight, what made director Jon Gulliver choose\nthe play? He has seen it four times and was\nvery moved by it, and chose it because it was\n'intense, interesting, dramatic and demanding'.\nHe also felt it was 'about time we had\nsomething serious in College'. It is of course\nnot normally wise for an amateur dramatic\ng^o up to select a difficult and demanding work\nto stage. But Mr Gulliver is evidently a no-nonsense type of man and when it comes to\nart (he has also written some good poems for\nthe latest Phoenix), he goes straight to the\nhard things. I 'll say straight away that he has\nmanaged to catch the bullet-between his teeth\nbecause his production is moving and pretty\ncaptivating. It is so rare for a non-professional\ngroup to achieve this (and it is hard to\nremember a previous College production\nwhich has been as moving and convincing)\nthat it is a considerable tribute to Mr Gulliver's direction and his fine cast.\nA brief outline of O 'Neill's life is called for\nbecause Long Day's Journey Into Night is\nunashamedly autobiographical. The son of an\nactor, his early childhood was spent in the\ninsecurity of hot e[ rooms in trains and\nFamily harmony? Julie Kerr and Paul Nixon as mother and son with David Simmons as\nelder brother in background. Linda Taylor as Cathleen performs house hold duties.\nbackstage. It was a difficult, rough-and-tumble\nlife that resulted in his mother's drug addiction.\nHe was also, as a child, steeped in the peasant\nIrish Catholicism of his father and the more\ngenteel, mystical piety of his mother, two\ninfluences, often in dramatic conf ict, which\naccount for the high sense of drama and the\nstruggle with God and religion that distinguish\nO 'Neill's plays. After leaving Princeton\nUniversity after one year, he went to sea and\nlived a derelict's existence, submerged himself\nin alcohol and nearly attempted suicide. It was\nwhen he was confined to as an at a rium because\nof tuberculosis that he began to write plays.\nLong Day's Journey Into Night is an\nagonizingly autobiographical play, and one of\nO 'Neill's greatest. It was dedicated to his wife and the dedication contains some pretty strong\nwords. 'I give you the original script of this play\nof old sorrow, written in tears and blood...I mean it as a tribute to your love and\ntenderness which gave me the faith in love that\nenabled me to face my dead at last and write\nthis play \u2014 write it with deep pity and\nunderstanding and forgiveness for all the four\nhaunted Tyrones.'\nThe play is straightforward in style but\nshattering in its depiction of the agonized\nrelations between father, mother and two\nsons. Spanning one day in the life of a family,\nthe play strips away layer after layer from each\nof the four central figures revealing the mother\nas a defeated drug addict, the father as a man\nfrustrated in his career and failed as a husband\nand father, the older son as a bitter alcoholic,\nand the younger son (O 'Neill) as a tubercular,\ndisillusioned youth with only the slenderest\nchance for physical and spiritual survival. The\nmother and father loved but tormented each\nother, the elder brother loved but corr up ed him (O 'Neill), with O 'Neill himself, caught and\ntorn between love for, and rage at, all three.\nThe play depicts in one day the breaking up of\na family, and in prose that is pretty strong and\nmoving.\nIn his dedication, O 'Neill talks about 'facing\nmy dead'. O 'Neill's mother became addicted to\nmorphine after the birth of her son\u2014a 'cheap'\ndoctor administered the drug to her because\nof her great pain in delivering him. His mother\nnever lost her addiction and O 'Neill felt terribly\nguilty about this. His later consumption\nperpetuated her addiction and to O 'Neill, his\naffliction became a kind of 'gallows', a way of\nredeeming his mother. O 'Neill blames himself\nfor his life and the misery it created for his\n>age K> March 11,19831\nparents. There are even references in the\nplay to a certain Eugene, a first offspring who\ndied in early childhood, and the rather\nunwanted Edmund who was the substitute\n(Edmund in the play is the author). The play,\nas shown in the dedication, is really an apology\nto his parents, where he expiates his huge\nweight of grief.\nThe play consists of five characters. The\nfather, James Tyrone, is played by Chris\nBarton. Mr Barton gives a very convincing\nperformance of a drunken, volatile and tightfisted man. As the play wears on, Mr Barton\ngives his all, putting across a clever, forceful\nand passionate act. Mr Tyrone's wife, Mary, is\nplayed by Julia Kerr. The character is lonely\nhas never known a true home and has hands\nwhich are never still, fidgety and knotted by\nrheumatism. Ms Kerr gives a captivating\nperformance and her sensitivity about her\nhands' appearance and her humiliation by her\ninability to control the nervousness which\ndraws attention to them is well put across. A 'ghost haunting the past', the drug in her body\ncauses her to vac ill i ate between naive\ndaydreaming and bouts of anxiety. James\n(Jamie) Tyrone, the elder brother, is played by\nDavid Simmons. He is drunken and degen er ate. Placed in the theatre by his father, he is\naccused of spending his father's money on\n'whiskey and whores' and of corrupting his\nbrother. Mr Simmons gives a very good\nperformance. Talented and confident, his\nacting is almost professional in its standard.\nPaul Nixon plays Edmund Tyrone. Mr Nixon\ngives a most moving act and is especially good\nat delivering the odd pieces of poetry in the\nplay. Again, total involvement in his part. And\nlast but not least, the good looking Linda\nTaylor portrays well the tender-hearted and\njovial maid, Cathleen.\nThe production is extremely moving and\nforceful despite the odd criticism. There is, in\ngeneral, a rather too even intensity of dialogue;\nthe difference between lines of casual\nconversation and parts where individuals lose\ntheir temper could do with amplification.\nThere is also a lack of bodily gesture; there are\ntoo many long 'still lifes'. However, stage\ndesigns by Matthew Tonks are good.\nDramsoc's production, despite faults, is one\nof the best in recent years. It shouldn't be\nmissed\u2014your time will not be wasted, I guarantee. Unreservedly recommended for\nstudents and staff.\nNick Bedding\nHH HH HH H HH1 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Simon Rodan, realising his hack credibility is\nslipping, is determined to go down fighting. To\nthis end he is squeezing the last life-blood out\nof a wearied and wearisome issue and has\nreached some surprising conclusions\nNUS Grovel\nOn February 10 I went to Endsleigh Street to the offices of NUS to find\nout some facts about the organisation, how it functions, what it does\nand how much it costs. Most important of all I went to find out how\nmuch it would cost us and how badly NUS wanted us back in by the\nlevel of concessions they were prepared to offer on planned re-entry\nterms.\nFirstly let me put the record\nstraight regarding allegations\npeople make abut in eff ice n cy, bureaucracy and waste. NUS has\na job to do and it approaches that\njob in a most professional way.\nTheir offices are cramped and\naustere. By comparison, our\nUnion Office is the epitome of\nluxury. In a room the size of\nStephen Goulder's office you\nwill find four or more people\nworking at desks separated only\nby temporary partitions.\nIs this the sort of affluence\nand waste one hears about so\noften?\nSome of you who read London\nStudent may recall that the NUS\nstaff went on strike a little while\nago. Ah, I hear-you say, look at\nthe incompetent buffoons, they\ncan't even administer their own\npermanent staff. The reality is\nvery different. In an attempt to'\nincrease efficiency of working\npractices and thus reduce costs,\nthe executive were cracking the\nwhip with ever more force until,\nin November, a breaking point\nwas reached. Perhaps they\nwanted just that shade too much\nfrom their staff, but believe me,\nthat is the sign of a healthy\norganisation not a sick one. I would suggest that a parallel\ncould be drawn between NUS\nand BL in that each are emerging\nfrom a period of decline through\nthe efforts of their respective\nleadership to instil a sense of\npurpose and streamline the\nefficient running of the organ is a tion. According to its President,\nNeil Stewart, NUS is now in a better position both politically in\nterms of stability and in financial\nterms than it has ever been\nbefore.\nWhat would NUS cost us? The\nfigures being bandied about by\nthe anti camp hover around the\n\u00a320,000 or more mark, while the\npro faction will suggest the\n\u00a310,000 is the most we would be\nliable for.\nIn fact the figure NUS gave us\nis \u00a313,300 including conference\nfeel. I will state that again: our\ntotal sub vent ion to NUS will not\nexceed \u00a313,300, including conference fees. If anyone tells you\notherwise they've got their facts\nwrong. The expense, therefore is\nnot excessive and should not\nfigure in the NUS debate. If\nthere is a will to re-join NUS as a matter of principle\u2014which is\nreally what the issue is all\nabout\u2014we must be prepared to\nmake some small sacrifices to\ncover the cost.\nIncidentally, Alan Watson,\nNUS financial officer is confident that by looking through the\nunion finances, we can find ways\nof saving \u00a313,000 from our\nbudget without in any way\nlowering the standards of\namenities IC Union provides for\nour students.\nWhat about phasing our\nentry? Certainly this would be\ndesirable; it would also give\nAlan Watson some time to\ntighten up more areas of duplication and come up with at least\nsome of the sub vent ion. NUS are prepared to offer a three year phased entry whereby\nwe pay nothing the first year,\nshould we rejoin in the summer\nterm, one third the next, and two\nthirds the year after, rising to the\nfull whack in the fourth year.\nThis perhaps gives a measure of\nhow much NUS would like a college with Imperial's prestige\nback in the fold, since they\nwould be offering this scheme\ndespite strong objection from a large number of colleges already\nin the NUS.\nSo there you have it, the facts\nin black and white. I would\nsuggest that it is now high time\nthe issues were discussed; it is\nnow over four years since NUS\nwas last debated on a Collegewide basis. If anyone has any\nfurther queries regarding NUS I would be glad to try and answer\nthem.\nSimon Rodan\nEAO\nBeat the Rush!\nAdvertise now for next year's SABBATICAL ELECTIONS\nThe Handbook Editor is pleased to announce that, by\nspecial concession on the part of IC Union, the ICU\nHandbook is not subject to election publicity rules.

    "content": "CCMI\nMany thanks to Scapino, who submitted\nthis week's puzzle; any member of the choir\nwho wishes to complain will be ignored. '\nRehearsal Requirement-The Saga\nContinues\nAs you must have noticed (unless, like me, you\nhad developed an immunity to day-glow\nposters) the Choir Committee is organising its\ncentenary concert next Friday, and because\nthe Treasurer has lost his, Casio Random\nNumber Generator, a Working Party is\nmeeting to decide the Rehearsal Requirement:\nthat is, the minimum number of rehearsals that\neach singer needs to attend. Because the choir\nhas a slight balance problem at present, there\nare separate Rehearsal Requirements for each\nof the four parts: soprano, basses, altos and\ntenors, and their respective Rehearsal\nRequirements come in that order (though I'm not telling whether that's ascending or\ndescending order).\nA word of warning about singers. Tenors\nhave extended the practise of lying about their\nability to sing top notes, and now invariably lie\nabout everything. Altos, however, only sing\nevery other note in rehearsals; consequently,\nany number mentioned by an Alto is only a half\nof what it should be. (Isn't this contrived?)\nSopranos and Basses are always truthful\n(although this does not necessarily reflect on\ntheir singing).\nThe working party consists of four singers,\none of each type, and the following five\nstatements are made at The meeting:\n1. The sum of the Altos a* nd Bass\nrequirements equals twice the Tenor\nrequirement plus that for the Sopranos.\n2. As Sopranos sing three times as many\nwrong notes as Tenors, they need to turn up\nto three times as many rehearsals.\n3. The Altos need to attend one rehearsal\nfewer than the Basses.\n4. The product of the Alto and Soprano\nrequirements is twice that of the Bass and\nTenor requirements.\n5. The product of the Alto and Tenor\nrequirements is twice the Soprano require-ment.\nGiven that each member of the Working\nParty has made at least one statement, the\nAlto has made only one statement, and that it is\npossible from this information to calculate all\nfour rehearsal requirements\u2014calculate them.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday. \u00a35\nfrom Mend-a Bike for a randomly selected\ncorrect entry.\nLast Week's Solution\nOf Bars and Bars\nThis was another one of those puzzles in\nwhich I set the problem, without knowing the\nanswer, and wait for solutions to come in. The\nbest solution sent in was for nine string players\nto be removed. Three people saw this, and the\nwinning entry was (oh no, not again) from R Tan of Chem Eng 2, who can collect his \u00a35\ncheque from the FELIX Office after 1:30pm on\nMonday.\nThe first two diagrams show two possible\nways. The third diagram shows one of the\ncommon errors (a lot of people sent in seven or\neight as a solution); can you find the square\n(there is one!)?\nAnother of Perola's puzzles for the Footnotes\nthis week; it's not as difficult as I would like for\nthe Footnotes to be, but the difficult one\ncomes next week\nThe cyclists and the fly^\nI expect most of you know the puzzle of the\ncyclists and the fly (or the bulldozers and the\nbee) but to refresh your memories.\nTwo cyclists start twenty miles apart-and\nride towards each other at a steady speed at\nlO mph. A fly flies to and fro between one set of\nhandlebars and the other, until the cyclists\nmeet, at a speed of 15mph. How far does the\nfly travel?\nSince each cyclist goes 10 miles at lO mph before meeting the other, the fly is in flight for 1\nhour. So he travels 15 miles. So far so good.\nNow let us suppose that the insect in\nquestion has had a hard day. He still flies at\n15mph, but each time he reaches a cyclist, he\nrests for two minutes on the handlebars. How\nfar does this fly travel?\nIMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\nSYMPHONY\nORCHESTRA\nConductor: Richard Dickins\nSoloist: Barry Douglas\nWalton P0RTSM00TH POINT\nTchaikovsky PIANO CONCERTO No 1\nMahler SYMPHONY No 1\nFriday March 11th8 pm The Great Hall\nTickets : \u00a31 (students 75pI from : Orchestra Members\nHaldane Library\nThe Door\n\u2022 o \u2022 \u2022\no \u2022 \u2022\no \u2022 o \u2022\n\u2022 ' \u2022 o \u2022\n\u2022 OO \u2022\n\u2022 \u00b0 \u2022.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 of Two correct solutions ^\nO \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 oo \u2022\noo \u2022\n\u2022 o \u2022\no \u2022 \u00ab\noo \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nooo ooo \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAn incorrect one\nImperial College Dramatic Society presents\nLong Day's Journey\nInto Night\nBy Eugene O 'Neill\nWednesday 16th March to Saturday 19th March\n7:30pm Union Concert Hall\nTickets: IC Union Office\nDramsoc Store\n\u00a31.50\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union-Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

    "content": "Forceful,\nMoving,\nand Major\nTheatre\nMiss Julie by Strindberg, directed by\nClare Davidson, Duke of Yorks Theatre.\nAfter a sell-out run at the Lyric Studio,\nHammersmith, Strindberg's Miss Julie has\ntransferred to the West End. This short ninety\nminute drama is exciting, intense and powerful\nand Clare Davidson's production is nothing\nshort of superb. Cheryl Campbell, one of the\ncountry's top actresses, plays the heroine, the\nyoung mistress of an estate who seduces one\nof her servants. Her portrayal is extremely\nforceful and moving and a major theatre award\nmust surely be destined for this production\nand her performance in it.\nAugust Strindberg (1849-1912) is arguably\nthe most outstanding playwright in Swedish\nliterature. Although he produced a vast\nvolume of work in his life, ranging from short\nstories, poems and autobiographical novels to\nUtopian essays and treatises on chemistry and\nsemantics, his reputation rests on his plays.\nMiss Julie is perhaps his most famous.\nStrindberg had a pretty troubled life, and his\nworks reflect the conflict between his unstable\ntemperament and the world around him,\nwhether in his unhappy childhood, in his three\ntempestuous marriages, or in his constant\nstruggle for recognition, and sometimes for\nsurvival. His pessimism and recurring sense of\npersecution were exacerbated by hostile\ncritical reception of his plays and the charges\nof blasphemy which were brought against him.\nIn times of deep despair he sought solace in\nalchemy and the occult. Nevertheless, his\ncharacter rarely allowed gloom to get the\nupper hand. Ironically Strindberg wrote 'I find\nthe joy of life in its violent and cruel struggle.'\nOvertly, Miss Julie is a struggle between the\nsexes and between aristocracy and serfdom. A battle was continually raging in Strindberg\u2014\nthat of the aristocratic blood inherited from his\nfather warring against 'the blood of the slave'\nthat came from his adored mother. The\nheroine, Miss Julie, is a direct ancestor of Lady\nChatterley\u2014a woman of independence and\nstrong will, but Strindberg's character is\nconsiderably more complex than this. Her\nlover Jean (played admirably by Stephen Rea,\nwho has just played the lead role in Ireland's first feature film Angel) is also a complex\npersonality, but the two form a powerful\ncharacter study of opposing personal traits\nand social values.\nThis extraordinarily rich play is set on a Midsummer's eve, in a Count's kitchen. A party for the whole household is going on and\nMiss Julie's behaviour is arousing the attention\nof the guests. She seems to prefer mixing with\nthe servants. Cheryl Campbell with a rather\nmasculine tone of voice and an overflow of\nbushy blonde hair lends a pretty erotic\nperformance, and soon into the play a seduction takes place. The remainder of the\ndrama is filled with anguish as the lovers try to\nextricate themselves from their predicament.\nThe act brutally shatters long-held ideals and\nimpressions, and the physical and moral\nanguish of Miss Julie and Jean is very intense\nand very moving. With human relationships,\nStrindberg's breadth of vision is considerable.\nStrindberg's Miss Julie is of major\nimportance in modern drama. Together with\nIREVIEWSH\nthe dramatist's own vision. Naturalistic drama\nplaced the emphasis on the daily life of ordinary\npeople in their normal domestic circumstances\nwith a credible sequence of events taking the\nplace of emotional intrigue (which was found in\nrun-of-the-mill French drama, popular at the\ntime). It was heavily influenced by the example\nEmile Zola'sdram at is ation of his own novel\nTheres Raquim and some of Ibsen's earlier\nplays, these works formed the new\nNaturalism and the beginnings of modern\ndrama. Naturalism demanded that the drama\nshould be, in Zola's words 'a slice of life\nviewed through a temperament', that is, that\nreality should not merely be photographically\nrepresented, but organised and interpreted by\nof novelists such as George Eliot and Balzac.\nIn Britain the naturalist drama was championed by George Bernard Shaw and others.\nIn his preface to the play Strindberg explained\nthat he had tried to avoid 'symmetric,\nmathematically constructed dialogue' allowing\ninstead the characters minds 'to work\nirregularly, as people do in real life...split and\nvac ill i a ting'. He was also seeking to concentrate into ninety minutes what playwrights\nhabitually spread into four or five acts, thereby\navoiding an interval, which he thought 'was the\ncurse of the modern theatre'.\nA production it would be a great pity to\nmiss.\nNick Bedding\nFELIXI\nHellcat\nFeminism\nTrafford Tanzi by Claire Luckham\n(Hellcat Feminist), directed by Chris Bond\nand Ted Clayton, Mermaid Theatre.\nThis entertainment is presented as a wrestling programme entitled 'Battle of the\nSexes\u2014a fight to the finish' featuring the\nVenus Flytrap Trafford Tanzi (played by Julia\nNorth) versus the Ever Popular Dean Rebel\n(Neil Dickson) and a full supporting bill\nincluding The Trafford Tanzi Story. The play\nbegins with the latter tale. Tanzi's life is traced\nfrom childhood to feminism in a series of\nwrestling bouts against a variety of sexists: her\nmother, father, schoolgirl Platinum Sue and\nunfaithful chauvinist husband Dean Rebel. The\nproduction is designed to make the play as\nclose to a wrestling contest as possible. The\nstage consists only of a wrestling ring\nsurrounded on all sides by seats, Mel at the\nOrgan, and a master of ceremonies who\nintroduces the evening's events. The other\nimportant contribution to realism is the bar\nwhich is set up at the rear of the auditorium.\nBeer may be consumed throughout the play.\nThis is not a play at which one sits quietly in\none's seat wearing evening dress and peering\nthrough opera glasses. Rather it is participation theatre in which drunkenness and general\nrowdyism can make positive contributions to\nthe atmosphere. The high standard of the\nwrestling further encourages the crowd to take\nsides with either of the performers and has\nbeen achieved thanks to fight direction by the\nBritish Middle Weight Champion\u2014Brian\nMaxine.\nThere are two reasons that a play about\nfeminism could fail\u2014either the humour is\nsacrificed for the feminist message resulting in\na boring play or the feminism is watered down\nin favour of entertainment value which gives a fainthearted work. Trafford Tanzi achieves the\nhappy medium combining the anti-sexist view\nwith a really good night out.\nDon't miss it! Student standbys usually\navailable.\nNick Hill\nI March 11,19831 IPagell\n\n"

All\nwelcome, all sizes of party\ncatered for.\nFriday was the day when nine\nmens teams and four womens\nteams converged on Malet Street\nThe reason for this strange\noccur en ce was the annual intercollegiate team competition\u2014\nthis year there was a slight\ndifference in that the women\nactually had a trophy to fight\nfor, but more of the trophies\nlater.\nThe men'sB team ended up in\nthe worst side of the draw, and,\nwith the aid of their apricot\nphysicist, they put up a good\nfight especially against Brunei\nand LSE. Despite their valiant\nattempts IC B were unable to get\nout of their pool.\nThe women's team put up a very good fight and were only\nbeaten in the fight for the gold\nFELIXillllllil il WII Ill ll ll ll ill ll ll l II\nmedal and the trophy by a very\nsmall margin, all three women\nheld their own against more\nexperienced opponents.\nThe men's A team sailed\nthrough the pools, and, despite a nagging injury, managed to put\nBrunei in their place during the\nsemi-finals, and once more\nasserted their superiority over\nthe whole of the opposition by\ncarrying away the gold medal\nand the trophy.\nAs a summary the result of the\ncompetition was IC one, the\nRest of London Nil.\nThis leaves only one thing to\nsay, let's make it the double next\nyear.\nMen's A team: Tim, Graham,\nKeith, Terry and Mark S. Men'sB team: Mark, T Martin, Andy P, Andy B and\nRichard.\nWomen's team: Kathryn,\nCaroline and Gabby.\nFinally, congratulations to\nKeith, who has now got enough\npoints for his 1st Dan, and to\nme, for getting my 4th Kyu (blue\nbelt).\nA warning note: the bit about\nus in the IC Radio report just\nisn't true, Martin's been working\nvery hard on his vocabulary.\nBasketball\nThis defeat at the hands of\nPaddington College could prove\nto be the most significant of our\nmany defeats, since this game\nwas basically a play off for last\nplace in the league. The pressure\nis now on us to do well in our\nhome match against them on\nMonday night.\nThe teams were fairly evenly\nmatched, and we led for three-quarters of the game losing out\nin the last ten minutes.\nA switch to man-to-man\nmarking in the first half lost us\nan eight point lead before we\nreturned to a zone defence. In\nthe closing stages of the game,\nwhen we were only two points\nbehind, poor shooting and\nrebounding sealed our fate.\nEven twenty-eight points from\nour 'leader' Alan Smith didn't manage to tip the scales in our\nfavour, and a lot of work will\nneed to be done to take us from\nthe unhappy situation of coming\nlast in the league.\nTeam: Richard Jones, Thalis\nKaragounis, Alan Smith, Andy\nMuddle, Ken Jarrett and Tim\nVink.\nIC vs QMC 52-82\nThe game at Queen Mary\nCollege was closer than the\nscore line suggests. A six minute\nperiod at the end of the first half\nwhen Queen Mary scored 24\nunanswered points, mainly on\nthe fast break, destroyed any\nhopes of a victory, and in the\nend decided the game.\nIt was to our credit that we\nkept playing hard throughout\nthe second half, but it was only\nfor the sake of keeping the\nscore line respectable.\nTop scorer was player-coach\nAlan Smith with fifteen points.\nTeam: Frank Rawlins, Alan\nSmith, Thalis Karagounis, Andy\nMuddle, Tammam Hamza, Tim\nVink and Richard Jones.\nIn the past this illustrious\ncolumn has likened shooting 100\nto sex. Hence I am please to\nreport that Gary Smith has\nenjoyed his first carnal experience, climaxing his ton admirably with no sign of the nerves\nthat have previously plagued his\nperformance. Declining to\ncomment we are forced to\nassume that it comes naturally to\nGary. Meanwhile our glorious\nleader proposed that the secret\nof success lies in sexual abstinence. Unfortunately since I fail\nto observe any success in the\nlatter but have noted several\ninstances of blindness, such as\nan inability to distinguish match\ncards and a tendency to walk\ninto trees, I am forced to\nassume\nLast Sunday saw the practice\ntrip for the annual inter-CCU\nfull bore competition at Bisley.\nDespite the late appearance of\nGordon, looking not a little\nstrained, a full quota arrived at\nBisley about 11:00am. Tragedy\nalmost ensued before a shot was\nfired as a certain person who\nshall remain nameless (but can\nbe contacted via Elec Eng letter-racks) attempted to lead his\nflock across a rapid fire SLR\nrange. This would have undoubtedly decimated the pride\nand joy of ICRPC, though might\nhave put Gordon out of his\nmisery. As for the shooting\nhonourable mentions to Jim and\nLittle Gary for fine scores. This\nleaves the competition finely\nbalanced, for arrangements,\nteams, etc, see notices in range.\nLast week also saw the final of\nthe handicap competition between Mark Bourke and Andrew\nHamilton. After the first card\nproduced an equal score a two\nway vicious smear and innuendo\ncampaign resulted in Andrews\nvictory by a single point.\nCongratulations then to Andrew\nwhose consistently good shooting saw him through.\nFollowing our recent expose on\nthe activities of certain female\nrugby a ff ici on a dos at IC we are\nnow able to bring you the story\nof their first match.\nThe international notoriety\nand fame of this squad enabled\nthem to arrange a fixture with a ladies team of equal standing\nand skill\u2014Rugby Club Wag\u2014\nanother of the top European\nLadies teams.\nThe match kicked off at\n11:30am, and in a closely fought\nfirst half, the 'fiery' IC girls\nshowed their Dutch counter-parts, that sheer enthusiasm\ncannot hope to make up for a lack of technique and ignorance\nof the rules.\nHalf-time, and with the score\nat 22-0 the visitors had a hurried\nand worried team talk\u2014meanwhile Maribel Anderson, the\never ardent IC captain, suggested that having changed ends\nthey would be able to see what\n. the other 25-yard line looked\nlike.\nThe second half followed as\nthe first, despite the weariness of\nour home team. The Dutch\nfinally struggled to a540 victory, just clinched with a last\nminute try by their captain.\nThe spectacle was nearly as\nenthralling as the performance\nput on by like minded ladies at\nTwickenham the same after-noon.\nCelebrations continued into\nthe night in the Union. Our\nerstwhile captain accepted a gift\nof RCW knickers in the Zulu\nstyle\nThe evening drew to a close to\nthe muted strains of Glenn\nMiller.\nSpecial thanks to Jim Boucher\nand John Symes for training us.\nAlso to all who played, or\nsupported. And to looney-man\nfor his help and wit. Finally to\nWarwick for his instructive but\nunbiased refereeing.\nI March 11,19831 IPage15\ni "

    "content": "Forsyth's Saga\nLocal Hero, cert PG, directed by Bill\nForsyth, starring Peter Riegart, Burt\nLancaster, now showing at Odeon\nHaymarket.\nWatching Local Hero convinced me of two\nthings; firstly that Bill Forsyth's success with\nGregory's Girl was no accident, but more\nimportantly that Britain is still capable of\nproducing beautifully crafted, intelligent films.\nAs producer David Puttnam (whose credits\nrange from Midnight Express to Fame to\nChariots of Fire) explained on a recent South\nBank Show, Local Hero is aimed to fill a gap in\nthe popular film market\u2014it is a gentle comedy\nwhich updates and extends the old Ealing\nComedy tradition.\nIt concerns the attempts of an American oil\ncompany's attempt to purchase a remote\nScottish village, lock, stock and beach, in\norder to build a pipeline terminal. Eccentric\nmulti-millionaire Felix Kapper (Burt Lancaster)\nsends young executive Maclntyre (played with\ngreat skill by newcomer Peter Riegert) to\nclinch the deal. He arrives with aw impish local\nrep in tow and soon discovers that the quiet\nlife of the village encroaches on his former\nlifestyle. The local sp iv, Urquhart,. posing\nalternately as hotel owner and lawyer, is left\nto handle the deal and soon money fever\ntrickles into the community.\nIt is difficult to decide which particular\nqualities make this such an outstanding film\nBill Forsyth's disjointed narrative lends itself\nnaturally to light comedy. As in Gregory's Girl,\nthe casual observation of many characters\nleads to a sprawling, meandering plot which\nweaves uncertainly through some wonderfully\ncomic scenes.\nIn addition the photography is quite\nstunning, making the Scottish location look\nmore appealing than many a tropical paradise.\nMore than this, Kapper's obsession with the\nstars means that all too rare attention is played\nto the beauty of the night sky, resulting in\nsome truly memorable scenes.\nOn top of all this a fine cast of mainly\nunknown actors do full justice to the setting.\nPeter Riegert and Denis Lawson (who plays\nthe randy, opportunist, jack-of-all-trades\nUrquhart) deserve special mention for\ncontrolled and confident performances.\nMore familiar faces also fare well, including\nFulton Mackay as beachcomber Ben Knox,\nwho eventually obstructs the plans, to the\ndismay of the whole village. Burt Lancaster\nwas quite obviously cast to add prestige to the\nproject and was an excellent choice. Although\nhe only appears fleetingly, it is enough to\nremind you that he is one of the best American\nactors in the cinema.\nBut overall, what does the film offer? It is\none of those rare films which is warmly\nromantic without being over-sentimental and\nleaves you with a warm glow of appreciation.\nThe unashamed optimism (of the ending in\nparticular) cannot fail to be both satisfying and\nre-assuring, but it is the comedy which\nprovides the basis of the film. We see how\nMaclntyre grows to love the little village while\nGee what is this place anyway?\nall its occupants are busy planning how to\nspend their millions. Odd characters turn up,\nlike the Russian trawler captain with a taste for\ncapitalism who tells him 'You cannot eat\nscenery Mac!' Throw in the local motorbike r( played by Gregory himself, John Gordon\nSinclair) plus a few more running jokes and\nyou have a sparkling comedy which, while\nnever making your sides ache, seems to\nprovoke a constant chuckle.\nLocal Hero is a fine example of how\nentertaining simple, honest films can be. Its\nfaults are minor and I cannot see any reason\n, how anyone can fail to enjoy it. Indeed, it's the\nsort of film which should have audiences\nrushing back to the cinema for more and is\nanother step towards re-establishing the ailing\nBritish film industry.\nSo, tear yourself away from the television\nand go and see it. This film is definitely too\ngood to miss.\nMark Smith\nappear in the plot.\nHaving said all this, the film is ultimately\ndiss appointing. Perhaps it is just that this sort\nof story is not suited to the large budget\nAmericanised film treatment. Perhaps a more\nadventurous style could have been attempted\nby director George Ray Hill. It is the sort of\nstory that needs to jump energetically from\nincident to incident and back again not\nnecessarily in any coherent order. For the\nsake of continuity much of the satire has been\nsacrificed. Instead of the pace being kept up\ndriving towards the (unexpected) ending, the\nfilm comes over as a series of very funny\nincidents punctuated by portions of American\nsoap opera (yuk). True, the film has inspired\nparts, especially the animated sequence\ndepicting Garp's father, and Garp imagining\nthe suicide of a dinner jacket pianist from a seventh floor apartment block window. These\nscenes are not capitalised upon, instead the\npace slackens and we await the next 'funny\nturn'. For a story that attempts to profess that\nlife should be lived the film moves a little\nslowly.\nAnother disappointing aspect of the film is\nthat, by its nature, the story seems relevant\nonly to Garp. Many opportunities for\ncomment on wider issues are missed. The film\nbegins to explore attitudes to women, men's fears of women and above all the great\n'Undertoad'. However, it never really finishes\nwhat it starts.\nA word on performances. Robin Williams\nplays the part of Garp far too honestly. Garp\nshould appear more like Yossarian of 'Catch\n22' than the ail-American boy with a weird\nmother. His mother is played nicely by Glenn\nClose but again the performance lacks an v real\n'bite'. Perhaps the best character is ation comes\nfrom John Lithgow as Roberta Muldoon the\ntr an sexual ex-football player befriended by\nGarp's mother and later Garp.\nFinally, although d is app on ted that the film\ndidn't carry through to its potential to s at i rise and lampoon American life and attitudes,\nGarp is an entertaining film worth seeing for\nsome very funny scenes. It's just a shame that\nwhat has the potential to be a visual Tom\nSharpe novel\u2014isn't. Chris Mailaband\nLoopy goings on featuring the family Garp.\nFELIXI March 11,1983 Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "THE PIMLICO CONNECTION\nThe Pimlico Connection started seven years when twelve electrical\nengineering students went to tutor at Pimlico Comprehensive School (hence the\nname). Since then the project has steadily developed, and now around a hundred\npeople are involved each year, going to five different schools In the local area.\nOn Tuesday 15th March we will be having a Recruiting Lunch from 12.30 in Elec\nEng606. This will give people who are interested a chance to meet some students\nwho have tutored this year, and receive more information about how the scheme\nis run.\nThe following day, on Wednesday afternoon, we plan to take people to visit the\nlocal schools so that they can see for themselves what tutoring involves, and meet\nsome of the kids and the teachers.\nLuckily, tutoring is rather different from\nwhat the teacher in \"The Bash Street Kids\"\nshown here goes through.\nTutoring aims to give school-kids extra\ninterest, help and attention in small groups\nof four or five, as a change from their more\nnormal lessons. It is not at all like formal\nteaching - the atmosphere is more like that of\na group of friends. Tutors try to balance\ngetting to know the kids with helping them\nto understand the work. Because students\nare often closer to the pupils in both age and\nattitudes than the teachers, the kids find it\neasier to ask questions and show what they\ndo or do not know.\nEngineering Tutoring\nWe help with a variety of engineering\nsubjects at two local comprehensive schools:\nHolland Park and Pimlico. Tht actual\nsubjects tutored are woodwork, metalwork,\ntechnical drawing and design and\ntechnology.\nThe subject I tutored was tech ical drawing\nat Holland Park. I found it helpful to have\nhad some workshop and drawing office\nexperience, but it is not essential. I found\nthat I was gaining as much as the kids from\nthe lessons. It is certainly important to have\nhad some basic workshop experience for the\nother engineering subjects.\nHowever this did not prevent me from\nenjoying being with younger people who\nwere from a different background to myself.\nI think the kids found the lessons enjoyable\nas well and it made Wednesday afternoons\nsomething to look forward to with eager\nanticipation. Richard Elwen\nMech Eng 1\nWe tutor in science, engineering, maths and\nelectronics from primary level to Sixth\nForm.\nI greatly enjoyed my tutoring this year and\nall tutors find it a thoroughly rewarding\nthing to do. You can learn a great deal\nyourself too, about the subject,\ncommunicating, children, about yourself\nand about the educational system.\nWe particularly need women students to\ntutor girls who often think science and\nengineering is only for boys.\nIf you are interested then please come\nalong to the lunch on March 15th.. Tony Atkins\n_ \u201e . \u201e , Elec Eng 1\nFox Primary School\nI have found tutoring eleven-year-olds at\nFox great fun and also very challenging. It is\ncertainly different to see things from the\nteacher's point of view. The work group\nsystem means that one can quickly build up\nfriends hp s with the kids.\nScience at primary level is fairly simple\nbut as it is so basic it is very important that\nthe kids understand it properly. One has to\ntry and explain concepts in practical terms\nthat can actually be seen-this can be\nsurprisingly difficult when one is used to\nworking with abstract differential equations\nand so on.\nOne project involves building a waterwheel and using the tap water to raise a weight through a set of pulleys. Everyone\ngets soaked, you slip on the wet floor, bits of\nSellotape are found later in your hair and it\nis all marvellous fun.\nTony Atkins\nScience Tutoring at Pimlico\nI tutored science to thirteen and fourteen\nyear olds at Pimlico School.\nThe science taught is a mixture of\nchemistry, physics and biology. Mixed\nability teaching is used, in the form of\nprogress cards\u2014so allowing pupils to work\nat their own pace to some extent.\nAmong the 'units' we covered were 'acids\nand bases', 'respiration' (usually counting\nyour pulse rate before and after running\nround the playground) and 'classification of\nplants and animals'. Don't worry if you\ncan't remember what an arachnid is\u2014the\nanswer is probably in the book!\nThere are generally three tutors allocated\nto a class of twenty to thirty pupils. The\nwork often involves practical work of some\nsort and it was then that the teachers most\nappreciated our help.\nYou remain with the same one or two\nclasses for the whole of the session and find\nthat you get to know the kids quite well. The\nkids I met were generally very friendly and\nenthusiastic. They call you by your first\nname and enquire after you if you are absent\nfor any reason.\nIt was my first time as a tutor and I found\nit both instructive and enjoyable. I would\ndefinetly recommend the experience,\nespecially to anyone considering a career in\neducation. c,^. band ra Cairns\nIf you are interested but unable to come to the\nintroductory meeting, just contact Dr J. S.R. Goodlad.Elec Eng 501 (int 3080) or John Hughes,\nElec Eng 3.\nPage 61 [March 11,1983 FELIX\n\n"

As Steve Marshall's FELICES showed, all this tactic\nachieves is that College fail to\ntake FELIX seriously and,\nultimately, begin to wonder\nwhether a Union which holds\nEDITORIAL\nsuch an extremely aggressive\nattitude is worth so much\nmoney.\nThere are times when, as\nPallab said, the editor should be\nprepared to be outspoken. Of\ncourse College should be criticised when it's appropriate, but it\nisn't the most subtle of attitudes\nto set out to annoy them from\nthe start. He said in the campaign that an editor should not\nadopt a middle-of-the-road\napproach simply to avoid\nmaking enemies. True, but\nconversely an editor shouldn't make enemies just to avoid\nadopting a middle-of-the-road\napproach.\nSocial Colours\nAny full member of the Union\nmay nominate any other member for Social Colours which are\nawarded for 'significant contribution to College social life'.\nNominations, together with\nseventy-odd words of justification must reach Andy Grimshaw\nby the end of term.\nEnd of Term\nDoesn't time fly when you're\nenjoying yourself! We've nearly\n\"reached the end of term and, as\nusual, there will be no FELIX on\nthe penultimate Friday; the next\nFELIX, the last before the\nholiday, will be on Wednesday\nMarch 23 and the copy deadline\nfor this will be Friday March 18\nat 1:00pm. Sorry I forgot to\nwarn you of this last week.\nRhyno\nAt last someone has volunteered\nto write a regular humorous\ncolumn. Rhyno's first offering is\non page 7. Let me know what\nyou think.\nImpossible without\nAdrian James and Olivo Miotto\nfor news, Peter Hobbis for\nphotographs, Pinocchio and\nWalkabout-Looksee for their\nrespected columns, Tim Noyce\nfor cartoons (including the\nbirthday cake), Chris Mallaband\nfor sport, Diane Love, Melanie\nSteel and Shweta Otiv for\nWhat's On, Nick Bedding, Nick\nHill, Mark Smith, and Lee\nPaddon for reviews, the ultra-reliable Caroline Foers for\n\u2022clubs and societies, Tony Atkins\nfor his page, Gastropod and\nCordon Bleugh, Rhyno, all the\npaster s up, but especially Lynne\nJames and Lawrence whose\nsurname I have forgotten; and\nMaz and Pete the Print.\nMartin S Taylor\niiii \u2022 1 1 i it iiii iii \u2022 iiii iii*i ii<i TALES OF Nick Gardner last\nweek didn't leave Stephen\nGoulder unprepared, and so\nwhen a phone call from a distinguished-sounding male\nvoice caught Stephen alone in\nhis office one morning, he was\nimmediately on his guard.\n'Could I speak to Mr Goulder,\nplease?' the voice intoned, as\nStephen, with mounting despair,\nlooked round vainly for one of\nhis minions to take the call.\n'What was it you wanted to\nspeak to Mr Goulder about?'\nparried Stephen, preparing\nhimself for anything from\ncombine harvesters to love-affairs with Union Officers.\n'It's a matter of private\nbusiness, I'm afraid. Is Mr\nGoulder not available?'\n'Well, who shall I say wants to\nspeak with him?'\n'This is John Smith, the\nCollege Secretary...'\nAnd happily, Stephen being a master at blustering his way out\nof embarrassment, was able to\nmuster sufficient heartiness to\ncover his confusion.\nI WAS MOST grateful for the\nimplied compliment paid me by\nFELIX Editor-elect Pallab\nGhosh two weeks ago. You may\nremember that in FELIX 638 I wrote a paragraph lampooning\nthe performance of our Honorary Secretary. On the day of its\npublication I received no less\nBELOW than three visits from Guilds hit\nsquad. Then, at 5:30 that\nevening, Pallab plastered College with the message 'A Good\nFELIX Editor Makes Plenty of\nEnemies'. Nice to know who\nyour friends are.\nTHEY DO SAY you shouldn't kick someone when they're\ndown, but I don't see why you\nshouldn't, especially when the\nsomeone makes himself such an\neasy target as Andy Grimshaw.\nAs Honorary Secretary he has\nbeen harmless enough, locked\naway in his office where he can't do too much damage; this week,\nthough, he has donned his\nReturning Officer's hat which\nrequires of its wearer a large\nquantity of initiative and\ncommon sense, two qualities for\nwhich Grimwash is not re-n owned. In consequence he has\nbeen scuttling about College\nwith all the relaxed confidence of\na mother hen trying to eliminate\nany trace of bias in the elections.\nSTOIC were the first to be\nmoaned at. For their election\nspecial, some of their technicians\nmade a large 'Hustometer' to\nregister the applause for the\nvarious candidates' speeches at\nthe Hustings UGM. The Hustometer was never used, since\n\u2022 iii \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ir rrr\" ii \u2022 ir \u2022 iii iii iiii iiii~ i~i~i~ ri~i~i~i~ iL rr i~i~i~ i~i~i iii iii Grimwash felt it might prejudice\nthe voting; he was only prepared\nto tolerate its use if it registered\nexactly the same reading for all\nthe candidates. One might\nunderstand his attitude if anyone\nwatched STOIC anyway\nBut on to the elections them-selves. Doubtless you noticed\nthat the ballot boxes are all\nsealed up with red tape and\nsealing wax. The purpose of\nsealing wax is, of course, that\nbefore it sets it will take the\nimpression of a signet ring so\nthat if anyone should break and\nre-attach the seal it is immediately obvious that the wax has\nbeen tampered with. Grimwash\ndidn't bother with an impression\nin the wax: He said that no one\nwould bother to take the trouble\nto break and remake the seal\nanyway. Since at least one of the\nballot boxes was returned with\nthe seal broken, it seems he was\nright.\nStill, the boxes were all\nlocked, each with its individual\npadlock through its individual\nhasp, and...each with its in divi dual-key tied to the ballot box by\nanother length of red tape.\nWhen Welfare Officer Jon\nBarnett queried this Grimwash\nwas ready with razor-sharp\nlogic.\n'If we removed the keys,' he\nexplained 'they would all get\nmixed up, and it would take ages\nto sort out which key opened\nwhich box'. Nevertheless in the\nface of more incredulous queries\nour gallant hero undertook this\ndaunting task, and on Tuesday\nmorning all the keys had been\nremoved from the boxes.\nBut the incident which caused\nmost alarm was the total loss of\nan entire voting station\u2014ballot\nbox, papers, lists and all\u2014early\non Monday afternoon. An alarmed and totally bewildered\nReturning Officer dashed into\nthe FELIX Office and frantically\nasked if anyone had seen the\nballot box which should have\nbeen in the Bot-Zoo tea room,\nAll the FELIX staff denied any\nknowledge of its disappearance,\nwhereupon Andy fled the office,\nmore panicky than ever, and,\nreturning only to make his\ncustomary cry of 'Don't publish\nthis!' dashed into the middle of\nthe quad and started running\nround in small circles when he\nrealised he didn't know where to\nstart looking.\nEventually the FELIX Editor\ndecided to make some discreet\nenquiries and asked one of the\ncandidates who happened to be\npassing. Christine Teller explained that of course the ballot\nbox had been taken from BotZoo, and didn't Andy know that\nthat box is moved to the Union\nLower Refectory from 11:30 to\n2 o 'clock? Apparently not.\nFELIX March 11,1983 Page 5\n\n"

The\nfact is that civil defence for Britain, while we\nstill have nuclear weapons, only makes war\nmore likely, because (1) it cons people into\nthinking nuclear war is somehow sur viv able and therefore fight able, and (2) it indicates to\nthe Russians that we are preparing for a fight.\nIf you agree that civil defence is a dangerous\nwaste of money, then join us on Wednesday\nMarch 23 at 5:00pm outside Mech Eng\nconcourse.

    "content": "A CUSHY LIFE?\nDon Adlington, the College Counsellor, talks about the things that get students down\nand how to get help\nThere is still a tendency for people outside the\nworld of higher education\u2014that is most\npeople\u2014to assume that a university student's life is something of an easy option, a relatively\ncarefree and publicly funded hiatus before the\nserious business of 'working' for one's living. I doubt if it was ever so, in recent times at any\nrate, even for the very rich who were not\nrequired to jump through academic hoops to\njustify the receipt of the next grant cheque. It is\ncertainly not so now.\nI often talk to students who are quite\nunaware that they are almost certainly\ninvolved in the most difficult, most demanding,\nmost stressful undertaking of their lives.\nUniversity study is inescapably rigorous, and\nwhile one sometimes meets undergraduates\nwho have taken A Levels in their stride, it is\nunusual to meet one who would make such a claim about degree work.\nThe sustained demand for clear thinking and\neffective learning inseparable from university\nlevel work does not come easily to the very\ngreat majority of the student population. The\nsort of intellectual activity central to the study\nprocess is peculiarly susceptible to serious\ndisruption if the student runs into emotional\ndifficulties, whatever their source. You could\ndig holes in the road, serve in a shop or drive a bus relatively efficiently if you were upset, but\nyou can't, usually, study efficiently.\nIt is for this reason, and no other, that\ncolleges have seen fit to employ counsellors.\nStudents don't have more or worse personal\nproblems than their peer-group outside\u2014quite\nthe contrary\u2014but their impact on the\nstudent's central activity is far sharper. A. period of anxiety or distress lasting for just a few weeks might well affect a whole year's work, and it seems to me quite important\ntherefore that when things do go wrong, a student should do something about it fairly\nquickly. Talking to friends, relatives or tutors\nmay well be all that is needed, and indeed most\ndifficulties are resolved more or less informally\nin that way. A counsellor may have something\nto contribute however where these other\nsources of help are either not available, or not\nsufficient.\nSome students come to me with fairly\nstraight-forward 'welfare' type queries, and if I can't help directly myself, I pass them on to\nother people who can. It is important that\nstudents should feel that all the College's support services are receptive and easily\naccessible, and that they can make contact\nwith whichever agency seems most acceptable\nand most appropriate. For example, my work\noverlaps to some extent with that of the\ndoctors. One student feeling fed-up and\nworried may think it the most obvious thing in\nthe world to talk to a doctor about it. Another\none with exactly the same anxieties may not\nperceive things in a medical context at all, and\nmay call on me. Sjpnilarly a student with a convoluted financial or domestic problem may\nequally appropriately come to me or go to the\nStudent Services Office.\nIn reality most students I see\u2014and certainly\nthe ones I see over a period of time\u2014are\ncoping with a degree of anxiety or distress\nwhich may well originate outside the university\naltogether. Most of them experience a certain\nadverse effect on their academic progress, and\na major part of my work centres on minim ising the damage. Naturally some students become\nunhappy as a result of work going badly, and\nwhere that seems to be the case it seems\nsensible to explore the underlying reasons for\nhis indifferent performance. This kind of\nexploration may involve an honest appraisal of\nmotivation\u2014that is recognising that some\nstudent find the work impossibly forbidding for\nno more sinister reason than that they do not\nreally want to do it. They may have opted into\nthe wrong course, or the wrong college. They\nmay indeed\u2014in a small minority of cases\u2014\nhave ended up in university despite a profound\ndistaste for studying. How the individual\nstudent might handle this kind of situation\nvaries enormously, and depends oa a whole\nvariety of factors. For example if, despite his\nsubjective view of his performance, a student\ncan, with encouragement, keep his head just\nabove the academic water-line, he may well\nthink it sensible to accept the situation as it\nstands. One would take a different view, say,\nof an undergraduate expressing profound\ndoubts as to his choice or course or college if\nhe presented in the autumn term of his first\nyear, as opposed to the spring term of his\nsecond. Similarly there can be no blanket\nassumption that the student who acknowledges\na more radical distaste for study should\nnecessarily abandon the notion of graduating.\nDepending on his temperament, with\nsympathetic support from tutors, and having\nput his difficulties into some sort of\nperspective, he might well decide to continue,\nin the perfectly acceptable conviction that\nwhile a high class degree is beyond him, a pass\nor a third class degree may not be.\nApart from these motivation problems,\nthere are of course some other kinds of\ndifficulty which interfere, in a more or less\nserious way with students ability to work\neffectively. Very few people would question\nthat a bereavement, the death of a close\nrelative, and its subsequent distress would\nnormally disturb work for a while. From my\npoint of view a broken love relationship would\nhaw precisely the same consequence, since\nthey are both grief experiences. It is the\nnatural, ie non-pathological, consequence of\nsuch events that an individual becomes\nemotionally disabled for a while, and the value\nof talking to someone, eg a counsellor,.at such\ntimes is that to an extent the distress can be\nshared, and therefore more easily borne\u2014not\nthat it can be avoided or suppressed. Similarly\nthe very threat to a key emotional relationship:\nthe intuition, for example that there is\nsomething amiss in an important relationship;\nor a breakdown in parents' marriage, can\nhave a devastating impact on an individual's sense of emotional security, and hence on his\nability to work.\nThere can of course be other, less specific,\nreasons why a student may be miserable and\nunsettled. The university population is bound\ntogether by two important factors. It is a young\npopulation, and its members are all high\nattain ers academically. Students are not\nselected on the basis of their emotional and\nsocial maturity, and it is a striking fact that a student who has very high academic standing\nmay be far less capable socially, indeed may\nfind it almost impossible to make relationships\nwith his fellow men and women at all. This\nincapacity may not be highlighted until the\nstudent moves away from the assured\nstructure of the family, and as a consequence a student for whom, on paper, everything seems\nto be well set-up, may in reality find him (or\nher) self desperately unhappy, but not quite\nknowing why.\nI think that it is often helpful in these\ncircumstances to talk to someone, (a) on whom\none has a right to make demands, (b) in strict\nconfidence, and (c) who is unlikely to be\nshocked or surprised at whatever is revealed. I am very easy to contact in the basement of 15\nPrince's Gardens, beneath the Student\nServices Office and next door to the Health\nCentre. My internal phone number is 4205.\nDon Adlington\nDon Adlington\nPagel4l March 11,19831 FELIX\n\n"

Large numbers of\npeople turn out to make sure\nthat they're alright; and whether\nor not the South African regime\noppress and kills innocent,\npeople doesn't seem to matter,\nthey just don't want anyone\ninterfering with their education.\nAs for the education cuts;\nmainly the attitude is that we\nwon't be here much longer\nanyway, so it won't affect us.\nThe fact that it will affect other\npeople doesn't enter into it. Not\nonly that, but we're quite happy\nto let the NUS do our dirty work\nfor us, and reap the benefits.\n'But the NUS is too political,' I hear the cry; and my reply is that\nthe reason this place is so\napolitical is that the students\nsimply don't care. Those who do\ncare and act on it are seen as\nharmless cranks, happily tolerated as long as they don't threaten our prospective five-figure incomes.\nThis is a good College,\nacademically at least. We haye a tremendous potential which we\ncould use to alleviate suffering in\nother parts of the world. It seems\nlamentable that a lot of us would\nrather use it to line our own\npockets, and leave the cranks to\ncare for the suffering and dying.\nYours in despair\nL Mercer\nME3.\nUnion Hacks\nThreatened\nSpecies\nDear Martin\nPeter Burt's threats to kill any\nunion hack found in the Bot' Zoo Common Room must be\nviewed with concern.\nThis harmless, lovable crea-ture, noted for its colourful\nplumage, peculiar habits and\ndistinctive mating call ('quorum,\nquorum'), was once a common\nsight around College. However,\nexams, the need to get good\ndegrees and the increasing taxes\non beer have already reduced the\nnumbers of this species.\nThe Bot/Zoo Common Room\nis one of the hack's few remaining habitats, where it can often\nbe seen foraging for tea and\nbiscuits. Any attempt to exterminate the hacks there could\nultimately lead to the extinction\nof the species; something that\nshould concern us all.\nYours\nJon Stanley\nPresidential\ncandidate\nconfesses all\nDear Reader\nI have written this letter to\nclear up a few misunderstandings generated by my electoral\ncampaign. The campaign was\nrun on a totally joke basis\ninitially to bring a bit of humour\ninto an otherwise stuffy atmosphere but during the campaign,\nhaving spoken to a great many\nd is ill is ui one d students, we\nrealised that something had to\nbe done about the running of the\nUnion. Many ideas were discussed including the running of\nthe bars being turned over to the\nUnion and hence the profits\nreturned to the students and\nother matters concerning the\nlives of the general student body.\nWe decided not to make any\nserious policies as they would\nhave detracted from the overall\neffect of the campaign. The\ncampaign was not to make any\npoints about the failings of\ndemocracy but to enliven the\ndull lives of IC students.\nYous sincerely\nC Burgess\nKingdon of\nHeaven\nPage 41\nDear Sir\nRoger Kingdon writes (FELIX\nMarch 4) as if we were free to\nchoose a religion for its desirable\nsocial effects. Surely the only\n\u2022 H HM HMM HH NH March 11,1983\ncriterion for accepting a religion\nis that you think it's true, that it\ndescribes objective reality. Mr\nKingdon also expects his religion\nto produce a morally good\nsociety. He expects too much, if\nonly because it would require the\nconversion of all people who act\nfrom selfish or sectional interest.\nOtherwise (as with every religion\nso far) they will ignore it,\npersecute its adherents or\npervert it to their own ends.\nJesus claimed that what he\ntaught was the truth, and that\nthe truth would set us free if we\naccepted it and acted on it. Only\na minority of any society would\naccept it honestly. It would bring\nthem a personal peace and unity,\nbut in society it would bring\ndivision and hatred. The ideal\nsociety is coming, but not\nbecause people practise Christianity\u2014that only affects the\npopulation. God will perfect\nit...in his own time.\nYours faithfully\nJeff Allen\nHorsemen\ndemand\nWalpurgis Night\nDear Sir\nWe wish to complain about\nthe total lack of publicity,\nconcerning St Walpurgis Night;\nespecially as the Christian\nfestival of Easter is a well known\nevent and even has a bank\nholiday associated with it. The\nproblem is compounded by the\ntotal lack of virgins at Imperial\nCollege, thus making our task as\nthe Four Horsemen of the\nApocalypse extremely difficult.\nThus, in the same way as 'ICU\ninstructs' at UGMs, the Four\nHorsemen of the Apocalypse\n'instruct':\na) FELIX covers in depth St\nWalpurgis Night.\nb) All virgins congregate on\nthe Queens Tower on the said\nnight.\nc) The Archbishop of Westminster celebrates Mass on the\nnorth side of the Round Pond.\nd) Fosters is cheap in the\nUnion Bar all night, otherwise\nThe Great Frog shall be called\nupon to claim retribution (and\nall the Fosters he can drink).\nYours in slight annoyance\nThe Four Horsemen of the.\nApocalypse\nPS: All mail concerning St\nWalpurgis night should be\ndirected to 215 Hamlet Gardens,\nwhere it will be dealt with on the\nastral plane.\nSean Davis\nSir\nYour comments in Wednesday's results FELIX editorial\n(March 9) about the election of\nSean Davis as Hon Sec can at\nbest be described as irresponsible and at worst as back-stabbing. The electorate, like\nmyself consider Sean the best\ncandidate for the post. He is not\na complete unknown, as you\nseem to think; or a hack, which\nyou think is an essential qualification (Quote...complete\nunknown has (again) been\nelected...for this reason he\nshould not have been elected...\nunquote) and he will certainly do\nhis best for students and the\nUnion, given a little encourage-ment. The last thing he, and\nanyone else needs is to be\ns lagged off before even starting\nthe job. And to be compared\nwith Mary Freeman and a lottery is laughable.\nYour attitude is even more\ndamning when one considers\nthat you only become FELIX\nEditor by being the only can di date; and so when someone like\nSean Davies wins an election\nfairly you condemn them out of\nspite.\nYours aggrieved lyS P Holt\nPhysics 3\nPoster Protest\nDear Martin\nI wish to protest about the\ndefacement of a CND poster,\nfound scribbled with 'communists' and 'traitors'. These are\nhardly well thought out arguments, rather more negative and\nmindless. The communist label\nis not true as anyone who\nbothered to find out about CND\nmembership would very well\nknow. Even some conservative\nMPs have been known to have\nCND leanings. Perhaps they\ncome under the 'traitors' label.\nTraitor to what? The safety of\nthe nation perhaps? In CND we\nbelieve the safety of all people is\nonly possible by the reduction\nand final elimination of all\nnuclear weapons.\nPeople who disagree with the\nprinciples of CND are welcome\nto come along to the organised\nmeetings and discuss points in a civilised way. Scribbling on\nposters is childish, mindless and\ntotally lacking in thought for the\ndedicated people who give up\ntime every week to put them up.\nYours in disgust\nJE Cox (Ms)\n(on behalf of ICCND)\nI FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "ISPORTI\nFootball\nSemi Final\nfor FELIX\nThe FELIX football team\nlumbered into action again last\nweek, playing in the Guilds\nsoccer sixes at Harlington.\nUnlike other appearances this\nseason, the team lacked sparkle\nand were lucky to scrape into a semi-final, only scoring two\ngoals in their three qualifying\nmatches.\nThe class showed, though, in\ntheir quarter final when three\ngoals were hammered home in\ndevastating style. In the semifinal final FELIX Met the\nHolbein Bulldogs (??) and were,\nquite frankly, outclassed. However, an astonishing goal was\nscored by Peter 'Pele' Rodgers\nfrom a long range free kick.\nPerhaps the internal conflict\nin the side (three prospective\nsabbaticals) let FELIX down.\nHowever, to get into a semi-final\nwas no mean achievement and\nI 'll stick my neck out predicting\ngreat things for this talented\nside.\nThe Boat Club, d is put ably one\nof the top sports clubs at IC, met\nboth Oxford and Cambridge\nUniversities in races over the\nweekend. The obvious conclusion was that Oxford are certain\nto win the Boat Race, provided it\ntakes place, with or without\nBoris Rankov.\nAt Reaching Head of River\nRace on Saturday over a2V4 mile course, Imperial took 13\nmin 46 some 40 seconds slower\nthan Oxford who won the event.\nIC's time gave them fourth place\nin what is Britain's second\nlargest head race.\nOn Sunday, the eight took on\nCambridge in two private races\nover 8 minutes on our home\nwater on the Thames Tideway.\nIn the first race Imperial started\nwell gaining three quarters of a length lead before being swamped\nby a police launch. By the sixth\nminute Imperial had drawn back\nto half a length down (approx 1\nsecond) when the Cambridge\ncox decided to end the race by a deliberate crash.\nIn the second race Cambridge\nstarted with a one length lead\nand eventually won by three\nlengths, going six seconds in the\neight minutes. This was an\nexcellent performance by the\nCollege 1st VIII, especially as\nCambridge had three stone per\nman weight advantage.\nThe crew is: Box: Jerry 'FT\nIndex' Thorp; 2: Greg ' Who needs\na full Hack' Harding; 3: Andrew\n'Skier' Spa/dick; 4: Bin 'Gozzer'\nBradbury; 5: John 'Heavyweight'\nO 'Brien; 6: Bollock Brother Nick\nHartland; 7: Bollock Brother Tom\nAnderson; Stroke: Bill 'full body\ncondom' Dowing. Cox: Mastoid.\nIf the Rifle Club insist on\nputting forward their ridiculous\nclaim to being even average,\nthen the Boat Club wishes to\nchallenge them to a two-way\nmatch at shooting and sculling.\nWhich all leaves the question:\nWhy can't the Boat Club women\ntell the difference between cox ed and cox less four?\nFootball\nFirsts\nIC vs RHC 4-1\nCapt Andy Page resumed his\npersonal vendetta against RHC I with his own version of the 'one-liner' and in doing so sent the\nopposing team captain for an\nearly bath.\nIn a mixed game IC 1st XI\nfought hard to control the game,\nand soon took the lead through\nthe 'opportunist' Dave Stephenson. RH C never looked like\nthreatening Harlow's Wednesday afternoon workout, until\nChamberlain momentarily\nforgot that the team had changed\nends at half-time, allowed the\nRHC centre forward to run-on\nand equalise!\nResolute work in defence by\nDumbo and ex-Bee Gee, Martin\nCurran kept the midfield in\npossession and allowed the IC\nforwards to exploit the labour-ring RH C defence. A low\ndiagonal ball from Stephenson\nacross the RHC penalty area cut\nthe defence in two, and Flanagan\ndrove home at close range.\nMinutes later, Flanagan again\nlatched onto a brilliant through\npass to send the ball screaming\ninto the back of the net. Meanwhile, the referee got his money-worth, and sent the RH C \u2022captain off, as he and Page\ndiscussed the 'meaning of life'.\nShortly before full-time\nChamberlain made it 4-1 with a well placed shot totally out of\ncharacter!\nThis was a good team performance so close to the UL cup\nfinal.\nULU Cup Final\nIC vs UC 1-1\nLast Saturday saw IC First XI\nset out on another intrepid\nexpedition to Motspur Park, this\nyear defending the ULU Cup for\n.the first time. The pitch inspection gave all the vital inform-ation: the pitch was there, it was\nenormous, bumpy and we'd have to finish early before the\ntide came in!\nThey said after last year's final\nthat the drama then couldn't be\nsurpassed. They were wrong.\nAfter only a few minutes the ball\nwas sliding across UC's goal-mouth, and if only Reeve could\nhave decided which part of his\nanatomy to put it in with, we\nwould have been one up. However the first half continued with\nthe Flying Harlow performing\nminor miracles to stop us going\nbehind. Meanwhile Dumbo\ndecided that the centre backs\nneeded a hand and proceeded to\ntake most of the long through\nballs. Half-time came and still 0-0.\nThe second half saw us begin\nto establish a grip on the game\nand if spoon foot Griffiths could\nhave kept his shot down we\nwould have gone one up.\nEventually it fell to Rickard to\nput us in front and with only\nfifteen minutes left it seemed\nquite possible that we could hold\nout to win. Wrong! A few\nminutes later it was 1-1 and then\nextra time again.\nIn the first half of extra time,\nwe looked like scoring while in\nthe second half they did. During\nthat second half Page decided to\nhave a rest, sitting down complaining of cramp. John McGuckin decided to pass to him\nand we all had heart failure as\nthe forward took it off the\nfloundering Page. Fortunately\nwe survived and in the end it was\n1-1 and a replay on Sunday.\nPagel6 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "INEWSI\nImproper Suggestions\nA lecturer in the Department of\nComputing came in for strong\ncriticism after he canvassed for\none of the Union's election\ncandidates during a lecture on\nMonday.\nMr Roger Bailey was showing\nslides to a hundred first year\ncomputing students when he\nincluded a slide advising them to\nvote for Colin Cooper, one of\nthe candidates in the election for\nDeputy President. He then went\non to tell his students that if they\nhad not already made up their\nminds about the subject, they\nshould vote for Mr Cooper. He\nalso referred to the other\ncandidates as a 'bunch of\nwan kers '\u2014a remark which the\nclass took in good humour.\nWhen questioned later, Mr\nBailey told FELIX his impression of ICU was that Union\nOfficers spent most of their time\nstabbing each other in the back,\nand that in his opinion Mr\nCooper was not the sort of\nperson to do that. He denied\nhaving referred to the other\ncandidates as 'wan kers'. ICU President Stephen Goulder has sent a letter of complaint\nto Professor Lehman, head of\nthe computing department,\ndescribing Mr Bailey's behaviour as offensive and constitutionally unacceptable inter-ference. He also requested an\napology to the other candidates.\nIn the event, the result of the\nelection was not affected, as Mr\nCooper, who was not aware of\nMr Bailey's intentions, lost to\nChristine Teller.\nElection\nRules OK\nThe Elections Committee last\nweek rejected Lee Paddon's complaint about advertising in\nsabbatical elections.\nMr Paddon had lodged a complaint that Pallab Ghosh,\nhis opponent in the election for\nFELIX Editor and now next\nyear's Editor-elect, had exceeded\nthe \u00a345 limit on advertising. Mr\nGhosh submitted a signed\nreceipt from Mistral Print, the\nfirm that had printed his posters\nand hand-outs, and as the\nCommittee could find no breach\nof election rules, Mr Paddon's complaint was turned down.\nNew Dean\nProfessor ET Brown of Mineral\nResources Engineering is to\nbecome the new Dean of the\nRoyal School of Mines. The\nRector announced the appointment on March 3. Professor\nBrown will take up his post on\nSeptember 1 for a period of three\nyears.\nBot-Zoo\nThe sale of tea and coffee in the\nBiology Common Room was\nindefinitely discontinued last\nweek.

Hockey\nClub Win\nUL Cup\nAgainst enormous odds IC\nHockey Club triumphed over St\nThomas's Hospital in the final of\nthe UL Cup at Motspur Park on\nWednesday.\nA ruling by UL Hockey Club\non Monday night meant that IC\nhad to play the semi-final on\nWednesday morning followed\nby the final the same afternoon.\nSt Thomas's had already played\ntheir semi-final the week before.\nThe semi, played at 10:30\nagainst Guys Hospital, was an\nextremely hard-fought game. At\nfull time the score was 2-2. and\nafter half an hour of extra time\nIC ran out 4-2 winners.\nThe final commenced at\n3:00pm. Again at full time the scores\nwere level at 1-1, and after\nanother 30 minutes of extra time\nthe score remained the same.\nThe game was then decided on\npenalty flicks, five taken by each\nside, and College converted 4 to\nSt Thomas's2. \u2022 Anybody interested in making\nmoney in their spare time (who isn't!)?

Although none are\nfrom Picasso's Cubist period, the creative\nliberating influence of the movement is clear in\nn^m. 'In these pr in s, the plane of the paper is\nstill the surface or window of an illusion, but\n\\r jie fixed, single viewpoint has been\nabandoned and the figures are analysed in\nrelation to each other and to the space around\nand'between them.\nThe overpowering impression is of\nspontaneity; each is an immediate response to\nSiWOTtjentary impression\u2014a beautiful woman,\na \u00bb\u00a7j jp py idea, a vision of passion or violence. .\n<&4$\u00b0 Ruiz Picasso\nPicasso himself has said: 'Everyone wants to\nunderstand art. Why do people love the night,\nthrowers and everything around us without\n\u2022JHSfetSflSo n understanding them? But when it\nCCUOTKUD a picture, people think they must\n\u2022iLm a^&t and' it. If only they would realise once\narif j for a\" that an artist creates because he\nJi*B \u00ab^^create, that he himself is only an\nrir Js j gni fiG ant fragment of the world and that no\nmore attention should be paid to him than to\nmany other things which delight us although\nwe cannot explain them.' -So go, and be delighted. Pajt of the\nfascination of this series of 45 prints is that it\nspans changes in Picasso's style from 1920 to\n1955. Forget the austere abstraction of\nCubism and enjoy graceful classical nudes,\nsurrealist figures on a beach, naturalistic\nportraits and a group of wittily gay pictures\nshowing the bucolic revels of fauns, nymphs\nand muscled heroes.\nWhen is a print not an etching?\nHaving said that understanding is not the\nprime purpose of looking at pictures, a small\nfootnote, or rather mid-paragraph note, might\nnot come amiss to sort out the techniques of\netching and dry point. To print the simplest\nline, the artist must arrange for ink to be\n\u00ab cq ny eyed to paper by means of an incision\neither directly cut by a sharp instrument\n\u201e (engraving and dry point) or less laboriously\nj and indirectly by protecting parts of the metal\n|, plate and allowing acid to erode certain\nexposed areas (etching). Ink is applied to the\nwho je plate and then wiped clean from the\nsurface but left in the crevices; it is sucked out\nfrom these onto dampened paper under heavy\npr assure from a rolling press. The depth of the\ncut or the time exposed to acid affect the\namount of ink each incision can hold, and\nh,ence the tone of the line. Just to confuse the\nissue,, the two techniques can of course be\n^qo^mbi ned! \"Covent Garden By Day\nFrom the Edward Totah Gallery, I walked\nnw th east along Floral Street and turned right\ndown James Street towards the Piazza,\nCouent Garden.

Most of the restaurants are in\ncentral London although a handful are within\nwalking distance of College.\nThe prices given range from under \u00a34 to\nover \u00a320. Nearly half the menus cost between\nC7 and \u00a310, about 30% are between \u00a35 and \u00a37\nand 10'V are less than \u00a35.\nThroughout the book is a repeated warning\nthat the prices may vary and that service\ncharges etc are liable to be added unless the\nmenus state that they are included. This is a wry real point in that the term 'fixed price'\nmight otherwise lull you into thinking tl j at the\nmenu price is all you would have to pay. In\nfact, on a menu with a 'fixed price' of \u00a37.50 the\ncost of wine, coffee, cover charge and service\ncharge could well bring the actual bill to\naround \u00a324 for two.\nAlthough the guide is clearly aimed at the\ntourist market rather than the in dig i nous population it is nevertheless a mouthwatering\nread and a useful aid if you are looking for\nsomewhere to eat in an unfamiliar part of\nLondon.\nThe guide is available from the College\nBookshop for the price of a cover charge or\ntwo.\ncolours of the rainbow: it's sold by weight,\n\u00a32.40 per lb for paper and \u00a33.75 per lb for\nenvelopes.\nThe redeveloped piazza is now a rather\nsmart tourist attraction and a fun place for the\nfashion conscious to 'see and be seen'. Go\nwalk about on a bright spring day: from new\nand familiar titles at the Penguin Book Shop,\nstroll past the tempting window of Thornton's Family Confectioners, piled with delectable\nEaster chocolates; invest in a Shetland fair isle jersey or a classic checked vi yella dressing\ngown at S Fisher; amuse and em baras s friends\non April 1 with sophisticated kitsch from\nStrangeways.\nW Penn 'Baker, Delicatessen and Fruiterer'\nsells chocolate chip cookies, as big as saucers,\nfor 23p. If you're thinking of baking your own,\npop into Covent Garden Kitchen Supplies for\neverything from Savarin moulds for rum\nbaba s, through the Professional Sabatier range\nof knives, to earthenware marmite s for long\nslow cooking of British hot pots and French\nd aube s. Between the parades of shops is an open-air-under-cover market selling handmade\nknitwear, jewellery and 3-D wooden jigsaw\npuzzles.\nAnd when you've exhausted both wallet and 1\nfeet, stock up with herbal tea and traditional1 English treacle toffee (50p for 4oz) at Culpeper\nthe Herbalist, and head for home.\nWhere, When, \u00a3?\nPablo Picasso, Etchings 1920-1955, are at the |\nEdward Totah Gallery, 39 Floral St WC2 until |\nMarch 19.

March 11,1983\nGarp, cert 15, directed by George Roy Hill,\nnow showing at Warner West End.\nTS Garp is a man struggling against the\nundertow of fate. The odds are always\nstacked against him winning. Conceived, when\nhis mother took advantage of a dying soldier's erection, he didn't really have the best entry\ninto life. As one can imagine from the style of\nconception his mother was quite an odd\nwoman. Reacting against a family to whom the\nword sperm was dirty and against a life where\na woman was 'either somebody's wife or\nsomebody's whore' she attempted to protect\nGarp from the all-powerful disease of Lust.\nTracing Garp's life from childhood to death\nthe film shows us Garp as a child imagining his\nfather to be alive. We see Garp being savaged\nby a dog\u2014he later revenges himself by\nremoving the dog's earlobe with his teeth! We\nsee Garp the aspiring writer trying to cope\nwith is mother's sudden notoriety, given to her\nby virtue of her outrageous autobiography.\nFinally we see Garp's realisation that he\nhimself is part of the undertow, or in his\nchildren's words, the great and mysterious\n'Under-Toad' lurking, waiting to get you.\nThe film tells us Garp's tangled and muddled\nlife through a series of very funny incidents\nusing many 'screwball' characters. One of\nthese incidents may well appeal to the\nstatisticians amongst us. Garp decides to buy\na house when he watches it half-demolished by\nan aeroplane as the chances of it being hit\nagain are very slim!\nThemes that run through the film are Garp's yearning for his dead and unknown father, the\ncyclic nature of life and that great level ler, death.
