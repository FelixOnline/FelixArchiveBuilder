You have definitely lost.\nEnd of Game\n26\nAfter a brief rush of adrenal in, your panic\nsubsides and you decide to approach the\nsituation like a mature sensible adult. You go\nto the HUB Office to explain that there has been\na mistake and that you only wanted a light bulb\nchanged.

The\nlight was still on when you tried to replace the\nbulb. You have electrocuted yourself, blown\nevery fuse in college, and broken the brand\nnew bulb, You are dead. This is a terminal\ncondition. Very few people-have recovered\nfrom death and you are not going to be one of\nthem.\nSubsequently, you are elected as chairman\nof three major sub-committees and go on to\nbecome Union President. Your presidency is\nacclaimed as being the most efficient,\nsuccessful and enlightened in Union history.\nUnfortunately, the light bulb still hasn't been\nfixed. You have, therefore, lost the game.\n34\nYou are now in the cp lle ge tunnel system.

    "content": "Feature\nThe pros and cons of sizzling\nNik Jones on amateur rocketry\nAvid readers of ' Hobby and Modelling Mart' may have seen a series of articles on amateur\nrocketry\u2014what it is and how to do\nit. It also described the building and\nflight of the rocket kit 'SIZZLER'.\nQuite by chance I have been\ninvolved in exactly the same project,\nmy version of which appears below.\nFor more information read on. Amateur Rocketry (AR to it's friends) was introduced to students\nat Imperial at last term's 'Picocon'\nscience fiction convention. AR started in America twenty years ago\nand the business is dominated by\nthe firm 'Estes', whose proud boast\nof 'over 150 million successful\nflights' leaves one to ponder on the\nnumber of unsuccessful flights.\nHere, model rocket building has\nbeen a hobby for years\u2014although\nactually launching a rocket was\nillegal until eight months ago:\nCustoms and Excise having only\nrecently allowed the import of the\nsolid fuel engines from America. As a result, the grounded rockets built\nby British hobbyists have mutated\ninto minor monstrosities (such as a fin-stabilised Taj Mahal) for which\nsuccessful flight was a dubious\nprospect.\nBuilding a rocket is fairly simple.\nAt its most basic, the actual machine\nconsists of a hollow body with fins\nglued on at the base and a loosely\nfitted nose-cone held on with a elastic string. A parachute stored\ninside the main body ensures that\nthe rocket safely returns to earth.\nThe base of the rocket houses the\nengine. This resembles ab anger, with a solid fuel charge sandwiched\nbetween a clay base and a cardboard\nwadding top.\nThe launching pad is a flat metal\nplate and a three foot vertical spike\nsticking out the middle. The plate\nstops the exhaust from igniting the\ngrass underneath. A metal tube is\nglued to the rocket body and threaded onto the spike is used to\nguide the rocket on the first stage of\nits journey. The spike can be angled\nto allow for the wind, although the\nlaw does not look kindly on angles\nof greater than 30\u00b0 from the vertical.\nThe engines is ignited by an\nelectrical fuse and a simple battery\nand switch circuit. The circuit burns\nout the fuse, melting the clay and\ncausing the solid fuel to ignite. This\nprovides the power to launch the\nrocket.\nA short while after the main bulk\nof fuel is used up, the cardboard\nwadding ignites, pushing out\nparachute and allowing the rocket\nto float gently to earth. Simple! The\ndelay depends on the engine used.\nThe altitude attained can be\nanywhere between 400 and 2,800\nfeet, depending on engine size and\nrocket type. Obviously, a multi-stage rocket can fly higher than a single-stage r.A starter kit is about \u00a3 3 0 ,\nexcluding engines. Rocket kits can\nbe anywhere between \u00a34 to \u00a335, the\nmost expensive being the\n'Astrocon'. This has a110 camera\ninstalled in the nose and, on reaching the apex of its flight, will\nautomatically take a photograph of\nthe ground directly beneath it!\nEngines are about \u00a31.25 each. At a minimum of \u00a32.50 a flight multi-stage rockets are not cheap. To save\nmoney, rockets can be built from\nscratch. A friend made one from a toilet roll, a ping-pong ball, balsa\nwood fins and a parachute cut from\na plastic bag. It flew.\nOn to the test of the 'SIZZLER'\nrocket kit. This was carried out on a Friday afternoon by Imperial's own M SE1AR Consortium. Dressed in lab coats we set up the\nlaunch pad by Speakers Corner in Hyde Park. Assembly of the rocket\nhad been done over two days to give\nthe resin holding it together long\nenough to dry. Three launches were\ncarried out and it soon became\napparent that the ignition fuses\nmust be inserted very gently as they\nare very fragile. Carry a few spares.\nOn the second and third flights the\nelastic string detached itself from the\nbody and the race was on to catch\nthe nose before it achieved 'splash-down', in the Serpentine.\nTheoretically, the rocket should\nhave travelled 800 feet up and 400\nfeet horizontally. Ours went over\n1000 feet once and drifted half a mile\non the third launch! This was with\nthe spike angled into the wind. Had it been vertical, the Imperial Space\nProgram would have come to a soggy end!\nIncidentally, AR is illegal is Hyde\nPark without permission from the\nSecretary of State for the Environment. However, the two\npolice vans who had been watching\nour experiments made no attempt\nto move us on. Funny old world.\nRumour has it that starter kits are\navailable in Hamleys.

    "content": "Felix\nThe Editorial\nA very secret society\nFreedom of information and 'the\nright to know' is a subject which is\nclose to the heart of every journalist.\nIt is particularly close to the heart of\nBritish journalists because Britain is\nbecoming too secretive for its own\ngood.\nIn the true spirit of pravda, the\nproposed changes to section two of\nthe Official Secrets Act will restrict\nindividuals 'right to know' whilst\nproclaiming perestroika.\nLess widely proclaimed is the fact\nthat the act will remove an individuals right to claim to be\nacting in the interests of the public\nwhen accused of leaking 'sensitive'\ninformation. And, in what must be\nthe ultimate absurdity, it will\nbecome ille gel to repeat 'sensitive'\ninformation even if it has been\npublished elsewhere and is common\nknowledge.\nThe Data Protection Act is another\ncase in point. Ostensibly the act is\ndesigned to allow individuals to\naccess files of personal information\nstored about them on computer. In\npractice, the act contains so many\nloop holes and the Data Protection\nRegistry is so short of power and\nresources that the act has become\nalmost ineffectual. The Government\ncomputers are of course exempt\nfrom the act.\nEvery one remembers Peter\nWrights problems with Svycatcher.\nBut the affair is only one of a series\nof media clampdowns which began\nwith Duncan Campbells 'Zircon\nsatellite' programme banned from\nthe BBC despite the fact that it was\nbased on information which had already been published.\nThe country's growing paranoia\nand obsession with secrecy is as\nunnecessary as it is unhealthy. I would not argue with the claim that\nmatters which are important to\nnational security should not be\nbroadcast to potential foreign\nenemies, but as in vesta gat ive journalist Steve Connor has pointed\nout in an interview elsewhere in this\nissue, there is a need for 'national\nsecurity' to be properly defined; too\noften it is used as a blanket term to\nhide political embarrassment.\nPerhaps Britain ought to take a lesson from the United States whose\n'Freedom of Information act' has\nproved that Governments do not\ncollapse when a country's citizens\nknow what the Government is up to.\nA very secret Union\nImperial College's own student\nUnion would also do well to sit up\nand take note of the 'Freedom of\nInformation act.'\nOver the past two years it has\nembarked on its own dangerous\ncourse of secrecy and press\nparanoia. And it has divorced itself\nfurther and further from the\nstudents it represents.\nThe relationship between FELIX\nand the Union has been tenuous in\nthe past, but the iron curtain which\nseparated FELIX and the Union\nOffice in the heat of last year now\nseparates the Union from the\nstudents.\nThe Union is becoming less of a student organisation and more of a business. It is becoming obsessed\nwith money whilst forgetting that it\nshould be a service to the students.\nOn a political level, the Union\nseems to be drifting away from its\nroots. Union General Meetings have\nbeen very badly advertised this year\nand consequently very badly\nattended. Instead UG Ms are rushed\nthrough as quickly as possible and\nimportant issues are decided upon\nby only a handful of hacks.\nThe Union's attitude was summed up by their failed attempt\nto abolish Union General Meetings\naltogether. Had this gone ahead,\npower would have been centralised\nwith the 30 people who regularly\nturn up to Union Councils, and not\nwith the student body.\nThe irony is that people will\nattend UG Ms if they are told about\nthem. FELIX and IC Radio proved\nthe point with a College-wide 'say\nno to no say' poster campaign. The\ncampaign resulted in the most well\nattended U GM for several years,\nwith over 400 IC and 250 St Mary's students turning up.\nI am often accused of having\nproduced a 'biased' edition of FELIX\nand unfairly influencing the\noutcome of the U GM by printing\nopinion articles which were anti-abolition. In return I could accuse\nthe Union of unfairly biasing the\noutcome of the U GM by having 250\nstudents from St Mary's to turn up\nto vote for abolition.\nThe Union Council too, is\nbecoming more of a closet\norganisation. Earlier in the year a motion was submitted by next\nyear's president to the effect that the\nminutes of Council's sub committees should not be circuited\nto members of Council. The motion\nwas ostensibly tabled on the\ngrounds that this would reduce the\nlength of Council meetings and tempered with the claim that\nminutes would be available for\nreference in the Union Office.\nIn practice the changes have made\nno difference to the length of\nCouncil. What they have done is\ngive next year's Executive carte\nblanche to push through any policy\nthey see fit without the rest of the\nUnion being any the wiser.\nIt would be naive of us not to\nexpect them to exploit it.\nA very dangerous press\nA free media is very dangerous to\na Union which would rather make\nits decisions behind closed doors. So\nit will come as no surprise to learn\nthat FELIX has been singled out\nfrom the Colleges other publications\nwith behind the scenes threats from\nthe Union Office to attack the papers\neditorial freedom.\nBut as students are well aware,\nand as President Nigel Baker\ndemonstrated with FIDO, a paper\nwhich is not editorially free is not\nworth reading.\nAnd so the Union have played on\nthe FELIX Editors other role as Print\nUnit Manager.\nAt Monday's Council, a seemingly innocuous policy was\npassed which again singled out\nFELIX from the other publications\nby insisting that the FELIX Editor\npresent reports to Council on the\nPrint Unit.\nIt is in noc cuo us aside from the\nUnion's declared intention that the\nopportunity should be used to force\nFELIX to take on more 'external'\nprinting jobs.\nThey forget that FELIX Editor\nalready works a seventy hour week.\nThey overlook the fact that the print\nunits primary role is the production\nof FELIX and publicity for clubs and\nthey ignore the fact that if we took\non more outside work it would be\nat the expense of the clubs and\nFELIX. Its a case once again of\nprofits being put above students.\nA very last word\nEnough of this. I'm off into the big\nwide world and I must leave the\nfuture of FELIX and the Union in the\ncapable hands of my successor,\nDave Smedley.\n1\ntug\n4 * - \u00ab fV J l\\ Jr\nThis is what I look like on a good day.\nThere have been few editions of\nFELIX I have liked entirely, but this\none comes close. It was originally\ngoing to have had colour inside\npages, but due to litho failure this\nissue had to be entirely printed\noutside and the colour had to be\ndropped.\nIt's bloody typical.\nBili x FELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7\n2BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

    "content": "News Review\nNEWS FELIX takes a look at some of this year's news.\nBricks and mortar\nAlthough many of the stories\ncovered by FELIX this year have had\ntheir roots in the financial problems\nwhich have beset the College in recent times, there has been no\nreluctance on behalf of both the\nCollege and the Union to spend\nlarge quantities of money on refurbishments.\nThe year began with the College's decision to spend \u00a31.4 million to\nconvert the Main House at Silwood\nPark into a conference centre\ncomplete with accommodation for\nthirty businessmen, private dining\nrooms, a swimming pool and a squash court.\nSnack Bar shocker\nNext on the agenda was a \u00a340,000\nrefit of the Union Snack Bar which\nwas given the go ahead following\nlosses of \u00a335,000 the year before.\nThe new snack bar featured seating\nfor 100 people, a lowered ceiling and\nFebruary: Mechanical Engineering\nbuilt the world's largest candle for\nthe British Epilepsy Association.\na new lighting system. Vending\nmachines for confectionery and drinks were installed, whilst the\nexisting furnishing (2 years old) was\nmoved into the Union Lounge\nwhich was given a lighting tower,\na stage and a lick of paint.\nProphetic words were uttered at\nthe time by Deputy President, Chas\nBrereton who said 'if we don't get\nthem in the first term, we lose them\nforever.' Despite the expenditure\nthe snack bar did not prove as\npopular as it had in previous years,\nwith high prices and small portions\nputting off many students in the\nfirst week.\nLater in the first term FELIX\ncaused an outrage by photographing a caterpillar found\nby a student in a Snack Bar meal.\nDespite accusations from the Union\nPresident that the caterpillar had\nbeen planted by FELIX, the Union\nCatering Committee decided to\nrename the outlet 'Caterpillar Cafe'\nand purchased a painted sign to\nannounce the fact to the world.\nIn October, the snack bar was\nmaking profits of \u00a31500 a month,\nbut in December this had become a loss of \u00a32171. There was speculation\nthat stock had been stolen from the\nstore cupboard, but the losses were\ngenerally attributed to a falling\nclientele. The Union's response, to\nreduce portion sizes further, was\nheavily criticised by FELIX.\nRefectory blues\nNot to be outdone, the College\ndecided to refurbish its own Sherfield refectory at a cost of\n\u00a3300,000. New serve ries were\nintroduced, new tables and chairs\nwere fitted and a pasta bar installed.\nThe refectories hit the headlines\nagain in December when a \u00a322,000\ndeficit came to light. Refectory\nManager, Rob Northey was unable\nto explain the loss which occurred\nin the wake of a gross profit of\n\u00a373,000 in the previous year. The\nCatering and Conference Services\nManagement Committee put the\nlosses down to increased salaries,\nbut when asked to comment on the\nshortfall Mr Northey's reply was 'I know nothing I see nothing.'\nFELIX Editor sued\nMr Northey gained his retribution\nafter the Christmas issue of FELIX\nwhen he threatened to sue the\nFELIX Editor, Bill Goodwin, over a 'Norman the Ex-Union Rat' article\nalleging that he had embezzled\n\u00a322,000 from the refectories to buy\na Porsche with sun roof and leather\nupholstery. After taking legal advice\nMr Goodwin agreed to raise \u00a3100 for\ncharity and print a retraction,\nalthough Mr Northey was kind\nenough to drop his case subject to\nFELIX printing nice things about\nhim for the rest of the year.\nCooking the books\nThe Union Bookshop also had its\nown share of financial problems. A trading deficit of \u00a316,771 was discovered in March which auditors\nattributed to thefts by staff and\ncustomers and under payment of\nsuppliers by mistake. In April, after\nthe Easter break, the Bookshop\nmanager, Roy Hicks decided to take\nearly retirement and the Union\napproved a complete refurbishment\nof the shop. New cashing up procedures were introduced and the\ngo ahead given for an open plan\nlayout, an Electronic Point of Sales\nsystem designed to monitor stock\nlevels and a tele-ordering system.\nOn the horizon...\nMore building plans lie on the\nhorizon. The College has completed\nplans for a \u00a3500,000 health suite for\nthe basement of Southside Hall of\nResidence. If the plans are approved\nby Union and College Committees\nthe health suite will provide a multi gym, weights facilities, a solarium and saunas.\nMeanwhile \u00a340,000 has been\nearmarked by the Rector to pay for\na new public address system for the\nGreat Hall. A new lighting system,\nsound proofing and improved\nacoustics will be installed later,\nsubject to the Rector finding the\ncash.\nNew Chemistry\nAnother project on the cards is the\nconstruction of an extension to the\nChemistry building. Actually, the\nproject has been on the cards for\ntwenty years, but it has taken this\nlong for the University Grants\nCommission to find the \u00a33.6m funding required. The news was not\nuniversally welcomed amongst\nacademics in the Chemistry Department who were frustrated by\nthe small size of the building and its\nlack of lecture theatres and fume\ncupboards. The Department is now\nhaving to negotiate with the Science\nMuseum for the retention of its\nexisting lecture theatres in the Old Chemistry building. Academics are\nkeen to point out, however, that the\nold Chemistry building has not been\nproperly maintained during the\ntwenty years that it took to find the\nfunding for the new building and\nthat it is now in a condition which\ncan best be described as dilapidated.\nSquatters trash Hamlet\nAccommodation (or the lack of it)\nhas featured prominently in the\nnews pages of FELIX.\nSquatters were evicted from\nstudent residences in Hamlet\nGardens at the start of the year\nfollowing a court injunction. The\nsquatters had cause several\nthousand pounds worth of damage\nand had threatened Hamlet staff\nwith physical violence. The squatters through furniture out of\nwindows, left the flats covered with\nabusive graffiti and contract cleaners\nrefused to clean one flat where\nsquatters had kept a dog and eleven\npuppies locked inside. The accommodation office gave students\na rent free week in an attempt to\nensure that the flats were not left\nunoccupied after the Summer\nMay: Security Chief Geoff Reeves saved the day when he successfully defused\na hoax bomb.\n1\nPage 10 FELIX June 21 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nCome back Dave B all is forgiven.\nDave Burns' swan song, in the last\nissue of Felix, was stimulating,\nwritten with great verve and\nconviction\u2014a personal view of the\ncurrent state of the College. Mine,\nno doubt equally singular, does not\nin all respects tally with his, notably\nwith regard to our divergent view\non the merits of the Rector. What is\nrather more surprising is that, on a number of the issues he raises, I would agree , or differ only by a nuance.\nBut let us start with the Rector he is so often uppermost in my\nmind. I am sorry Dave that I bored\nyou on the first of October in1986. It is, I fear, too late to make amends.\nAs to that infelicitous phrase which,\nin a moment of exuberance, escaped\nmy lips, I will have to live with the\nrecord\u2014as did Queen Elizabeth the\nFirst, with respect to the occasion of\nher celebrated non-verbal utterance,\nwhich has reverberated through the\ncenturies, though of course none of\nher courtiers heard a thing.\nI am told that I recommended\njoining a club (singular). Now what\nis in my mental ROM is a recommendation to join two and to\ndevote serious efforts to both\u2014one\nsport and one society. Perhaps I reached the second one, after Dave\nhad fallen asleep.\n\"The Rector has declined to write\nitems for Felix this year...\". Not\nso\u2014he was never asked! In case my\nsenile memory was at fault, I did\ncheck this with the Editor. Why is\nhe not seen more with the troops?\nWell now, there you have struck a sore point. In the transformation\nfrom a working academic, to this\njob, the reduced opportunites for\ndirect contact with students is the bit\nthat I find most frustrating. Its a problem which is not easy to cure.\nI do see groups of students, usually\nthose playing some specific role academic affairs, representatives on\nstudent/staff committees etc. I have\nsupervised one Ph.D student\u2014that\nworked, but only because he was\nprepared to see me at 8 a.m. What\nabout the other 6000? I would\n.welcome suggestions. I did actually\ntell the President that I would be\nPage 16\nhappy to attend a Union Meeting\nand field questions. I did do just that\nonce, when Taig was Queen. I am\ngame to try it again. But of course,\nnot many students come to Union\nmeetings\nI should add that the role of chief\nexecutive of Imperial College is\narduous\u2014much, much more so\nthan running some commercial\norganisation having a similar\nturnover. Its not hierarchical-persuasion is all. Moreover the\nuniversity system is under attack\u2014\nand has been for the best part of two\ndecades. Paradoxically, it is much\nharder to defend an elite place such\nas ours, where almost every\nDepartment is amongst the top\nthree in the country, than a mediocre university. If you cut a little from a run of the mill university, it simply gives its\nmediocrity a slightly different hue.\nCut bits in Imperial College and the\ndamage is immediate and real. The\navoidance of lasting damage\nremains a formidable challenge.\nI cannot find any evidence to\nsupport Dave's analysis of the\nUnion\u2014how, in golden days it had\nhummed and now was on the\nslippery slope to doom. He appears\nto recommend \"kicking arse\" (k.a.), Dave Burns\u2014home and dry or out at sea?\nV\\1 as the primary route for effecting\nchanges. It may work in the Navy,\nbut in the real world, it is very rarely\na successful strategy, though it can\ngive great satisfaction to the kicker,\nan outlet for suppressed frustration;\nit is above all a call for public\nrecognition: \"I go, I go, look how I go,\nSwifter than the arrow from the Tartar's bow\".\nIn the Presidents that Dave\ncompared and contrasted, he\nbelieves that \"Christine Taig did not\nset out to change the world, so the\nworld was not changed\". Well\nDave, the world is a great big place.\nBut let me tell you of one little bit\nof it that she did change. We had the\nchance to buy 10 houses in Evelyn\nGardens. Then as now, we had no\nmoney. We had to borrow the stuff.\nTo service the loan, this required a complex re jigging of student rents,\nwhich could not have been done\nwithout the support of the Student\nbody. Christine Taig pulled it off. As a result we have Fisher Hall; 200\nmore students can live within\nwalking distance. Sure the rents are\nhigher than anyone wants\u2014but to\nmy mind getting rooms within\nwalking or cycling distance is the\nmost important single problem the\nCollege faces. What good would\nk.a. have done?\nI find myself in agreement with\nthe critique that too many students\nstart narrow and emerge even\nnarrower. But it is not a new\nproblem and I am sure that contrary\nto Dave Burns' view things are\ngetting better. Here the perspective\nlent by old age does have\nadvantages. I arrived here in1945( No, the Rector did not address us;\nI do not think I ever clapped eyes\non the fellow in my undergraduate\ndays). The social life was very\nle strict ed, the Clubs and Societies\na minute fraction of the riches now\non offer. There was for example no\norchestra, no chamber music. The\nnearest port off call for that was\nBloomsbury. Now the orchestra and\nthe choir are magnificent and as\nnear professional as any set of\namateurs are likely to get. We have\nsoloists who, should they tire of\nJune 21 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Science\non about 20km of cable but later on\n100 km. The second is much more\ninteresting. The plan is to deploy the\nsatellite 100 km below the shuttle to\nan altitude of 130 km. This will be\nthe first time this region of the upper\natmosphere has been subject to\nextended study; previously it could\nonly be reached by instrument laden\nsounding rockets for a few minutes\nat a time. The atmosphere is dense\nenough at this altitude for the\nsatellite to require s tabi lising vanes.\nAlready there are plans for an\nimproved upper atmosphere\nsatellite, streamlined and equip ed with a cooling system that will\nenable it to reach much lower\naltitudes; such a system will be very\nuseful for investigating ozone\ndepletion and the increasing\nconcentrations of greenhouse gasses\nin the atmosphere. A low flying\ntethered satellite would also make\nan almost ideal platform for military\nsurveillance although most official\nNASA sources are quite reticent\nabout this aspect.\nThe satellite is deployed as shown\nin the diagram, from a12m boom\nextending from the orbiter's payload\nso there will be a small in it al tension\nin the cable to prevent it from\nbecoming tangled. This is not\nenough to unwind the huge cable\ndrum carried on the orbiter so the\nsatellite must be deployed in it ally by\nsmall rocket thrusters. To retrieve it,\nit is simply wound in by an electric\nmotor on the cable drum. The cable\nitself is made of several materials\nand is very expensive, but a kilometer of it only weighs slightly\nHess than a kilogram, and although it is only 4 mm thick, it can\nsupport nearly 30,000 kg.\nThere are plans to test other\naspects of space tethers in the near\nfuture. The momentum scrounging\ntechnique (see box) is to be tested\nusing the SEDS (small expendable\ndeployment system); the idea is to\ndeploy a100 kg mass on a50 km cable which will then be cut,\nhopefully giving the mass a200m/s kick which will carry it into an orbit\nabout 700 km above the shuttle. This\ntechnique is almost ideal for use\nwith the space shuttle because most\nshuttle payloads are needed in high\norbits while the shuttle needs to get\ninto a lower orbit for return to earth.\nAnother application would be with\nthe supply shuttles to the space\nstation 'Freedom' (if it is ever built):\nIt would enable the shuttle to return\nto earth without needing to carry\nextra fuel for braking rockets and the\nstation would be given a small boost\nto counter the small drag it\nexperiences in its orbit.\nThe third tether application to be\ntested will be the PMG( plasma\nmotor generator). The idea is that if\nthe tether cable is an electrical\nconductor, then a large voltage\n(around 250 volts per kilometer of\ncable) can be produced. In this case,\nthe difficulty is trying to produce a useful current from this as you can't simply string two cables between\nthe satellites. The ingenious solution\nis to collect free electrons at the top\nfrom the surrounding ionosphere\nand eject them from the bottom\nsatellite, creating what is called a phantom loop. The in it al test system\nwill produce 5 kW of electricity but\nlater versions could be much larger.\nOf course the energy must come\nfrom somewhere; in this case it\ncomes from the energy possessed by\nthe orbiting shuttle which will\nslowly drop into a lower orbit when\nthe PMG is in use. The change is\nhowever quite small and doesn't matter much as the shuttles only\nstay up for about ten days anyway.\nThe current plan is to fit a full scale\nPMG to the space station to make\nuse of the energy given to it by\ndeparting supply shuttles.\nThere are many ideas for the use\nof tether systems in the long term\nfuture; many are, to be honest,\ncranky. One idea is to connect a space station in geostationary orbit\nto the earth's surface with a cable,\nallowing payloads ride into orbit on\nboard glorified cable cars. Apart\nfrom the fact you need a cable with\na strength to mass ratio about 10,000\ntimes better then the best known today, its a neat idea. Other\nproposals include a probe, to the\nasteroid belt, able to retrieve many\nsurface samples from different\nasteroids by fire ing and reeling in a small pen et rat or probe and very\nhigh resolution mapping of the\nmoon and other planets by very low\nflying tethered satellites (the military\nimplications have already been\nmentioned).\nTethers basically offer a new way\nof doing things in space and hence\nwill affect almost every aspect of\nspaceflight. It is a rapidly developing aspect of technology\nwhich is being watched with very\nkeen interest by the space\ncommunity.\nIMightline\nNightline\nNightline\nWhat is Nightline?\nNightline is a confidential telephone\nservice which provides both\ninformation and non-directive, non-judgemental counselling.

    "content": "On the Tube?\nThe Subterranean Avengers\nAlex Upton-Park is something major\nin the City: one of those people who\nappears with monotonous regularity\non television and radio to talk about\nRPIs and balances of payments. He has spent all his working life in the\nCity where he started as something-junior-to-someone-minor almost\ntwenty years ago.\nThis is the public face of Alex\nUpton-Park Cityman. But there is\nmore to him than this, for Alex\nUpton-Park is the founder and\nguiding light of the mysterious\ncommuter group \"The Subterranean\nAvengers'.\nTo find out more, I agreed to meet\nUpton-Park one lunchtime at\nEmbankment Station. I was to carry\na copy of the Telegraph under one\narm and a copy of Time Out under\nthe other. I felt schizophrenic. At one thirteen precisely he appeared,\nhis large bowler hat all but covering\nhis eyes and carrying a long\numbrella. He rushed across the\nstation to shake me by the hand.\n'Hallo! Upton-Park's the name, of\nMid bar c lloyd de Zoett West\nMerchant Bank,' his voice dropped\nto less than a whisper, 'you're from\nthe newspaper?'. I nodded. He\ngestured towards a nearby\nluminous green plastic seat. We\nboth sat down.\n'The others,' he whispered,\nglancing nervously around, 'will be\nalong in a minute.'\nA train arrived. The passengers\nsqueezed like grey toothpaste onto\nthe platform and forced their way\nup the stairs and out into the fresh,\nclean carbon-monoxide on which\nLondoners thrive.\nSuddenly Upton-Park stood up.\nHe looked up and down the\nplatform, apparently sc rut in ising every face. 'They're here!' he\nannounced mysteriously, 'the\ninterview may commence.'\nI took out my notepad and pen,\nsharpened my clich es, took a deep\nbreath and asked the question\nwhich had been irritating me all day:\n'What exactly are the Subterranean\nAvengers?'\nUpton-Park looked at me with\ncontempt. I was obviously not in the\nknow. ' WE,' he emphasised the\nword, 'are the ORIGINAL commuter protection organisation.\nFor over a decade, WE have\npatrolled the Underground: protecting the humble commuter\nfrom the dregs of society, fighting\nfor what is right and what is British.\nOne for all and all for one!' He stood\nto attention and saluted. I pretended\nI wasn't there. All around me,\npeople hid inside their newspapers,\nor started reading the wall posters.\nIt's a universal language, they were\nall saying 'never seen him before'.\nUpton-Park hummed the National\nAnthem and sat down. ' Why me?'\nI thought.\nUpton-Park put his patriotism\naway and continued.\n'Our primary task is to prevent\ntrouble. Now I know Kung- Ludo\nand all that is very popular with\nthese Guardian Angels, but it just\nisn't very British. Too direct. Too\nforeign. We work by forcing any\npotential trouble makers off the\ntrains before they can do anything'.\nAs if one cue, a train arrived and\nUpton-Park jumped on board. I followed.\nWe were in a fairly standard\ncarriage, surrounded by graffiti,\nadverts for temping agencies and\n'Poems on the Underground'.\nUpton-Park managed to get a seat.\nI had to stand. 'See that man,' he\npointed with his umbrella, 'that's Jim Snaresbrook. He will be the\n\"target\" for this demonstration.'.\nSnaresbrook was a small w impish man carrying a copy of the Times.\nHe was apparently trying to do the\ncrossword.\n'Say, the target looks as if he is\nabout to cause an incident, the\nAvenger in charge, known as\n\"District Line Information\", will\nsignal to others present that there is\ngoing to be an attack. Like this.'\nUpton-Park hit the roof twice with\nhis umbrella and looked long and\nhard at Snaresbrook. A tall man at\nthe far end of the carriage started to\nweave through the crowd. He\nstopped just behind the unfortunate\ntarget. 'This is stage one,' UptonPark informed me, \"The lanky\nfellow is from the Crossword\nsquad'.\nFrom where I was standing I could just hear the two men. The tall\nman was leaning over the shorter\nman's shoulder. ' No,' he was\nsaying, 'six down is definitely\nwrong. Seven across is obviously\n\"seraglio\". God, I could do this\npuzzle with my eyes closed...' He\nhad a whining, patronising voice of\nthe sort you wouldn't inflict on your\nworse enemy. He seemed to be able\nto talk without moving his teeth.\nUpton Park explained. The\nCrossword Squad apparently\nreceives early copies of every\nnewspaper and a highly trained\nteam spend much of the early\nmorning solving them. Copies of\nthe solutions are then sent to the\nduty members who are under\norders to memo rise and destroy\nthem. This valuable information can\nthen be used to irritate people to the\npoint of distraction.\nUpton-Park swung his umbrella in\na tight circle above his head and the\nCrossword Squad withdrew. 'Stage\nTwo,' he told me, 'is the umbrellas.'\nHe took his hat off and put it back\non again.\nThe Umbrella Squad leapt into\naction. Upton-Park pointed out each\nmember in turn. There was a short\nchubby lady armed with one of\nthose spring loaded folding umbrellas which open at the\nslightest provocation; a military\nlooking man wielding a short heavy\numbrella build like a club; and, the\nmost lethal of all, a city gent carrying\na long pointed bayonet-like b roll y underneath his arm. 'We brought a job lot of b roll ys second hand from\nthe Bulgarian Embassy,' explained\nUpton-Park.\nThey advanced on the\nunfortunate target, barging through\nthe unseeing crowds. Within seconds, he was surrounded. The\nactual attack was a short as it was\nvicious. I hardly saw what\nhappened. There was abo ing,a crunch, a thud, two gurgles and a howl of pain. Next thing I saw was\nSnaresbrook doubled up as his\nattackers lost themselves again in\nthe crowd.\n'If stages one and two fail, we\nhave to resort to our last resort. The\nmost hideous form of mental torture\nknown to man. The Walkmen.\nObserve...'. Upton-Park stood up,\nstamped his foot and sat down again.\nI began to hear a thudding hissing\nSound. Dum-di-di-dum-di-di. I looked around. Almost everyone in\nthe carriage seemed to be wearing\na walkman. They were all slowly\nturning up the volume. 'Stage three,\nlevel one,' Upton-Park informed\nme. He stood up again and stamped\nhis foot twice.\nThe walk men owners started to\nhum. It was a tuneless sort of hum,\ncloser to a moan or a whine. It\nbecame louder and louder, more\npersistent and more irritating. My head started to ache. In the middle\nof it all, the target was trembling.\n'Level two,' Upton-Park shouted\nabove the din. 'The Walkman Squad\nhave never ever had to go above a level two. But, if pushed we will\nresort to level three, our final,\ndesperate ultimate deterrent.\nWatch!'.\nHe grabbed two ceiling straps and\ndid a forward roll in mid air: a difficult mano eu ver in a crowded\ntube train. The effect was sudden,\nfrightening and unforgettable.\nSuddenly the walk men owners all\nstarted to sing. It was the worst\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 29\n\n"

Cheapskate\nThe time of year had come when everybody in Cheapskate was\nlooking back over the past and looking forward to the future. John\nSecretary smiled as he mused over some of the battles of old between\nthe Citizens of Cheapskate and the Surefield Fortress. Now he was\nleaving it all seemed so trivial.\nIt had never been the same since.. since...since Arthur Michael had\nleft. Phallix had a field day but never again would Surefield have such\na perfect scape goat. He still remembered the time Arthur Michael\nhad bought a new boat for the boat club, only to find himself promoted\nto the heights of Chief Landlady instead of Fleet Commander. That\nwas when they'd sent him to the tower as well. Yes, Arthur Michael\nhad spent a joyful Summer, throwing money from the top of the tower\nwhilst telling everybody exactly how many steps they'd have to climb\nto catch him.\nOf course when Michael had left, everybody had been terrified of\nbecoming his replacement in Phallix. The only candidate with the right\ninitials had been Senior Assistant Dogsbody, Malcolm AldHump, but\nthat had been td#obvious.\nJohn Secretary had an inward snigger as he thought of the Baron's face as he had realised that the new Arthur Michael was none other\nthan the Baron himself.\nDerek Dash had proven himself worthy so many times that there\nhad been little choice in the matter. His best entries had always\ninvolved him letting Mad Dash loose with the cheque book. Mad would\ngo out shopping and before he knew it she would have bought a crate\nof fancy lights for the Dining Room; thank goodness she'd managed\nto offload them all on McNorthey.\nMcNorthey, now there was a potential source of amusement. Such\na pity he had threatened to sue Phallix and forced Editor\nWillhebegoodforacolumninch to be nice to him all year. There's always\nnext year., thought John Secretary.\nThe Citizens' Office was so different now as well. Things had never\nbeen the same since Jolly Hockeysticks had privatised the Office two\nyears ago and the Citizens had voted in a group of accountants and\nmanagement consultants to lead them. John Secretary still\nremembered the days when the citizens had rebelled and had held\na last stand over McNorthey's Burger Bar. What revolutionaries they\nmust have felt as tl>ey refused to eat the burgers under the watchful\neye of the Chief Citizens. Surefield had shut the burger bar in a panic\nand had offered the new Chief Citizen, Ian Whygate, a free bag of\nchips for everybody who wanted to be ripped off by the burger bar\nin the future. John Secretary sure as hell knew who was boss...\nThe balance of power amongst the Citizens now lay with the\nbalance of the books. Nobody in the Citizens' Office wanted to know\nhow the Citizens felt about anything any more; their time was spent\non far more important things like what colour the new wallpaper in\nthe Citizens' Snack Bar should be and which new space invader\nmachine they should put in the fun room. John Secretary knew that\nthe Surefield Fortress had never changed, the changes in the Citizens'\nOffice just made it seem that way.\nPage 18 FELIX June 21 1989\n\n"

    "content": "News Review\nKenneth Baker visited IC and announced 'top up loans'.\nLetting Scheme.\nA squatter of a different sort came\nto light in November when it\nemerged that because of an administrative error, a member of\nstaff had been living in student\naccommodation for three years. The\nmember of staff concerned, Carlos\nFloreS refused to leave the flat when\nthe mistake was discovered,\nclaiming that he had sitting\ntennant's rights.\nAn expensive gamble\nIn September, the College spent\n\u00a32.9 million on a student residence\nin Earl's Court to house 40 students.\nThe rental for the residence, Olave\nHouse, a former Girl Guides Hostel\nwas set well above the rental in other residences, at \u00a355 per week.\nAlthough this figure was insufficient to pay off the interest on\nthe loan taken out by the College to\npay for the residence, the College\ntook the gamble that the loan capital\nwill continue to increase at a lower\nrate than the rise in value of the\nproperty.\n'People always accuse me of not\ntaking risks and now I'm taking\none' said College Secretary John\nSmith.\nRent strikes at IC\nEarly October brought with it the\nthreat of rent strikes from the\nresidents of Fisher Hall in Evelyn\nGardens who were complaining\nthat the Student Accommodation\nOffice had deliberately attempted to\nmislead them over rent levels. A meeting of ninety students voted to\npay rent only at the previous years\nlevels on the ground that they had\nnot been told about rent increases\nbefore moving in. Accommodation\nOfficer, Loretta O' Callaghan admitted that she had failed to\ninform students of the new rent\nlevels.\nA week later the threatened rent\nstrike was joined by residents of Beit\nhall who were angry that they had\nnot been informed of the increased\nrent levels - 12% greater than the\nprevious year - when they accepted\nplaces. They were also unhappy\nwith the College's decision to charge\nfor an extra weeks rent over the\nChristmas holidays.\nImperial College Union supported\nthe rent strike with a motion calling\nfor the College to use the income\ngenerated by taking on more\nstudents to sub sid is e accommodation. The motion was\npassed by a Union General meeting\nin an amended form which threatened a College wide rent\nstrike should the governing body\nrefuse to transfer \u00a31000 to the\nresidence account for every\nadditional overseas student taken\non.\nLexham rip off The power of the press can never\nbe underestimated. In early\nOctober, FELIX investigated\nallegations that the College was\nunfairly charging students for\ndamage in Lexham Gardens. The\nunusually high damage charges,\nwhich represented the accumulated\ndamage costs since the College\nstarted renting the Lexham Gardens\nhouses, had been passed on to\nstudents after the College had been\nforced to hand the property back to\nits landlord. Halfway through\nFELIX's investigation, the College\ndecided to reverse its decision to\ncharge students for damage they did\nnot cause saving itself considerable\nembarrassment in the process.\nCeiling collapse\nMany of the residences have been\ncursed this year with falling ceilings.\nThe first downfall hit Southwell\nhouse in October when a three by\nfour foot slab of % inch thick plaster\nbecame dislodged. The room was\nunoccupied at the time. There were\nat least five more downfalls during\nthe remainder of the year, though\nnot all of the incidents made it to the\nnews pages of FELIX. Evelyn\nGardens Superintendent, Peter\nLeeson, told FELIX that the College\nwas unable to afford to replace all\nof the eighty year old lathe and\nplaster ceilings but said that they\nwere checked every two years.\nThe College have now adopted a policy of sweeping up fallen ceilings\nas quickly as possible so that the\nevidence can be binned before\nFELIX photographers arrive on the\nscene.\n170 for sale\nIn November the cost of\naccommodation was becoming so\nmuch of a problem that Imperial's 'QT Soc' decided to re-inflate the\nresidence account by putting the\nRector's House up for sale. An advertisement was placed in The\nStandard and The Times offering\nthe residence for \u00a35 million and 'for\nsale' signs appeared in front of the\nproperty. Deputy President, Chas\nBrereton, whose phone number was\ngiven as the contact number said\nthat he had received some\ninteresting offers. Unfortunately,\nthe Rector was unavailable for\ncomment.\nTop up loans\nIf there is one thing which has\ncaused students to sit up and take\nnote more than anything else it is\nthe plans to introduce student loans\nby 1990. The plans were first\nmooted at by Education Secretary\nKenneth Baker during a low key\nvisit early in the year when he took\npart in an informal discussion with\nImperial students. The plans were\nannounced officially in the\nCommons in November, with a full\npage of coverage in the next day's FELIX. Under the scheme , grants\nwill be frozen at their current levels\nand students will be given an\ninterest free loan, but students will\nnot be entitled to claim housing or\nunemployment benefits.\nThe proposal allows a student\nliving in London to borrow \u00a3460 per\nyear and \u00a3340 in the final year.\ncontinued on page 32\nMay: the new Royal College of Science Union Executive are 'initiated'.\nNEWS June 21 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

Of course this could\nbe due to his consummate skill in\ndelegating all work to his staff to\navoid doing any himself.\nHe has had a varied and interesting 'career' at College,\nincluding being in QTSoc and\nindulging his taste for doing very\nodd and pointless things and\nstanding for the post of Union\nPresident and becoming President\nElect for approximately 48 hours,\nonly to be disqualified. It's nice to\nsee that he has finally managed to\nfulfil both ambitions by swapping\njobs with this year's president for a week.\nDespite his attempts at anon-y mit y, he has become well known\namongst certain parts of IC, namely\nthose people he has annoyed this\nyear. These are too numerous to\nmention but number much of the\nCollege hierarchy, several heads of\ndepartments, Union Office\nsabbaticals, various Union hacks\nand several religious, social and\nover-dramatic societies. The sad\naspect of this for Bill is that he rarely\nintended to annoy any of these\npeople and that most of the people\nhe deliberately set out to enrage\nhave failed to react in any way.\nAnother characteristic Bill has\nbecome renowned for is his stout\ndefence of FELIX and the freedom\nof the press against all comers. In\nfact he sem s to have spent a lot of\nthis year defending various\nfreedoms: the freedom to be bored\nsenseless by UG Ms, the freedom for\nSTOIC, IC Radio (Commerical Free)\nand FELIX to determine their own content without interference from\ncapitalist bourgeois exploiters (sorry,\nSydney Harbour-Bridge)...I think it\nwould do Bill some good to go and\nremind himself of the poster the\nFELIX Printer, Dean, has hanging\nby the litho: 'The freedom of the\npress is controlled by those who\nwork the presses'. Fortunately Bill\ncan operate the litho himself and\nthis has proved very useful when\nprinting the front page at one\no 'clock in the morning.\nSomething that the staff will\nremember Bill for is his\nperfectionism. This has deteriorated\nIf's lonely at the top.\nover the year as he has been forced\nto realise that he cannot do\neverything to the standards he\nwould like without forcing himself\nand his staff to take no sleep at all.\nHe has become kind hearted\nenough to allow us all to go home\nfor four hours sleep a week. This\nlightening of attitude has not\npermeated as far as the news pages.\nBill will insist on writing every word\nhimself, insist that he has to write\nfifteen stories to fill two pages and\nthen discover (by this time it is\nmidnight on Thursday, and the\ncolla tors have finished the rest of\nFELIX and are fretting for the front\npage) that there's only space for half\nof them and that he need not have\nwritten them all.\nAnother of Bill's endearing (?)\nqualities is his boundless\npessimism. 'We'll never get it ready\non time' he will mutter gloomily on\nTuesday afternoon only to find on\nWednesday morning that the\nnewspaper fairy has mysteriously\narrived in the night and pasted up\nall but three pages. The only reason\nFELIX is late is his aforementioned\nobsession with news.\nEnough of that. The FELIX Office\nhas been a very exciting place to\nwork this year because Bill's style of\n'management' has been to\nencourage all the staff to do\nwhatever interests them most and\nallow them to use some of the more\ntechnical pieces of machinery. This\nhas made working in the FELIX\nOffice educational as well as fun.\nBill would admit that this strategy\nwas as much out of necessity as\ndesign as he started the year with\nonly three regular members of staff\nfrom the previous year. The strain\nof producing his fresher s' issue\nnearly single-handedly has taken its\ntoll. Apparently there was a time\nwhen Bill was calm and organised\nand the Office was tidy. The staff\nwho have joined since the start of\nthis year can only believe this to be\na piece of mis reporting and a factual\ninaccuracy.\nBill has also been drawn into one\nof the favourite comforts of many\nprevious Editors: alcohol. He is\nreputed to have begun the year as\na sober and abstemious soul but was\ngradually led down the slippery\nslope of indulgence. He is believed\nto have been corrupted chiefly by\nhis Business Manager, but she\nclaims he was quite corrupt when\nshe first met him and didn't need\nany help at all. Bill has vague\nmemories of the many embarrassing\nacts he has committed whilst under\nthe influence this year, but the fact\nthat he is editing this article means\nthey will remain unpublished. At least for now...\nSeriously, Bill has been a great\nperson to work with: encouraging,\nenthusiastic and only occasionally a miserable sod. The FELIX Staff wish\nhim good luck as he leaves to\nbecome a real journalist and breathe\na sigh of relief that they can get rid\nof him at last.\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 31\n\n"

They mean the dirty hectic\nmetropolis that is London without\nits soul, its guts and the greater part\nof its alimentary canal: I mean, of\ncourse, the theatre.\nNow I'm not a 'Theatre-Goer' nor\nis there any such species (Phantom\nof the Opera fans excepted perhaps).\nBut I like my mind and my senses\nto be jolted into action once in a while and if ever there was a place\nand a time to jump start the neurons\nin your nod dle it was London in\n'88/'89.\nAlan Ayckbourn was the first to\ntake the jump-leads to my body. I was drawn to see his Henceforward\nat Richmond Theatre (still playing\nat the Vaudeville with a new cast)\nby a vague nostalgia for an old habit.\nSomewhere between the base of the\nseat and the tip of the funny bone\nwent two hundred and forty volts,\nmore than enough to tickle the\nalcohol smothered synapse\nguarding the only surviving route to\na fold marked 'Do Not Open'. Firing\non at least two cylinders and as oiled\nas a lager lout I uttered those clich ed words T really ought to do this more\noften'. It was the beer talking but I'd never heard a pint of Fosters make\nso much sense.\nIn order to ensure that I'd got the\nmessage right, I decided to check\nwith another anti pode an oracle by\nthe name of Castlemaine at a pub\ncalled the Orange Tree a little way\nup the road. As surely as I downed\nthe third pint of liquid gold, I saw\nthe sign that read \"Theatre club': it\nwas ordained.\nIn a small space above the pub I discovered that night what seemed\nlike an intimate bedroom scene.\nLove, betrayal and incestuous\nlongings were played out with\nferocious passion un tempered by\nthe presence of a hundred pairs of\neyes. Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles\nhad been staged as it ought to be,\ninescapable and taught.\nThat night settled the matter and\nconvinced me to cross the Rubicon\n(just west of Waterloo Bridge) into\na perpetual night of West End,\nFringe and Dance theatre. During\nthe preceding months three red-hot\nplays linked by the themes of anger\nand injustice had taken a steady\nattrition on my resolve to stay in and\nstick to the ve gie vision.\nLook Back in Anger, Osborne's classic play, lured me into the\nTheatre Museum Theatre in Covent\nGarden. I was promised that\ndirector Jim Dunk (who advertised\nMolsen lager on the box and so was\nan obvious connoisseur) had given\nthe play a great new re-interpretation. The result put me off\n'interpretations' and great\n'adaptions' for life. I saw it as Jimmy\nPorter betrayed. I'm still on the look\nout for a better production but\ncouldn't afford the one day 'Friends\nof the Earth' bash at the Coliseum\nlast Sunday.\nNext it was Arthur Miller's turn\nto stir up the bile with his version\nof Ibsen's An Enemy of the People at\nthe Playhouse. Sure enough the\nman has a persecution complex, but\nwho wouldn't have after a brush\nwith McCarthy? Kindled by the fires\nof outrage I left in search of another\nnoble victim.\nAs luck would have it I found a veritable martyr courtesy of\nTennessee Williams in his Orpheus\nDescending, Jean Marc Barr as Val\nXavier and Vanessa Redgrave as\nLady Torrance set the Theatre Royal\nHaymarket alight (almost literally)\nas they stoked up the fires in Hillbilly Hades. With Julie\nCovington as Carol Cutrere the\nevening went up in flames. It was\na baptism of fire for me as I discovered the heat given off by\nsuch a strong cast.\nI think that it was shortly after this\nthat my troubles became\ncompounded by the discovery of a new and perhaps more potent vice.\nDown and down I went into the\nseventh circle of hell and the\nRiverside Studios, Hammersmith.\nHere the floppy hat brigade fester\nin eternal damnation forced to listen\nto each other's pretentious prattle.\nThat night they were out in force but\nthey didn't detract from the\nstunning performance of Molissa\nFenley the New York contemporary\ndancer. I was staggered by her\nstamina and the vigour of her\nvisions as her naked torso twitched\nto the strings through the whole of\nStravinsky's Rites of Spring. I made\nmy escape just in time to avoid a particularly highbrow conversation:\nThe question being asked was\nwhether the nudity was in fact a creatively integral part of the work,\nor was Molissa gratuitously 'getting\nthem out 'cos that's just the crazy\nkind of New York girl she is'? I guess I 'll never know.\nIt was time to take stock I decided:\nTo assess where I was going with all\nthis. So I calmed down and took\nmyself off to the Fringe. To the Man in the Moon, a pub venue where I understood what was going on.\n'Yes. of course I like the\nfeeling...of a full cunt.', yelled the\ndemonic diva. Oh no, I was in for\na Berkoff battering. From My Point\nof View only lasted an hour thank\nGod. During this time, despite the\nnumbing ranting, the chief effect\nwas to make me marvel at the skills\nof two theatrical contortionists. Still,\nit was a great venue.\nBack at the bar I decided that I'd opt for the admittedly absurd rather\nAyckbourn's Henceforward\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 41\n\n"

But here there is little to\ncomplain about, and much to\npraise.\nThe story is one of love, prejudice,\nmoney and revenge.

He summons his enemies to the island\nusing his magical powers, but his\nmotives for revenge give way to\nhumanity and forgiveness. Prospero\nis in command of everything except\nhis own divided self. Wood's deep\nvibrato voice gives every word both\npower and expression.\nDesmond Barrit plays a roly-poly,\neffeminate Trinculo, whose scenes\nwith Stephano and a hideous\nmonstrous Caliban have never been\nfunnier.\nThe music is wonderfully wie rd and the magical effects are superb.\nThe production stresses all that is\ngood about the play\u2014it's chimerical,\ndream-like quality, the powerful yet\nvulnerable aspect of Prospero's character, the pathetic humour of\nCaliban, Trinculo and Stephano,\nand the innocent love of Miranda.\nBut above all, what makes the play\nso effective is its air of wondrous\nmagic and illusion.\nbond regarded as a joke.\nWhile Bassanio wins Portia,\nAntonio fails to meet his bond and\nso Shylock, long-time sufferer at the\nhands of Christians, claims his\npound of flesh. In the ensuing\ncourtroom scene Portia disguises\nherself as a lawyer and wins\nAntonio's case.\nThe production and performances\nare a delight to watch. A permanent\nset, consisting simply of columns\nenclosing the acting area is\ninstantaneously and un fussily changed back and forth between\nVenice and Belmont. Its\ntransformations are so swiftly\nachieved, using excellent lighting\ntechniques, that the scenes virtually\nmerge into one another, allowing\n..... < \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nfJ} Hoffman\nA Midsummer\nNight's Dream\nOPEN AIR THEATRE, REGENTS\nPARK\nThe Dream played in the park is quite\nthe most appealing production I have yet seen.

At first, I felt uncomfortable at the sight\nof hippies dancing around and flicking peace signs, but then it\nbecame clear that setting the play in\nthe 1967 Summer of Love suited the\ninnocent hedonism of the characters.\nIt seems silly to have Saeed Jaffrey\nas a mahar ish, Oberon and a sexpot\nTitania played by Sally Dexter, but\nsomehow it all seems to work.\nChristopher Benjamin plays a Felicity\nplump bumpkin Bottom\u2014a constant\nsource of hilarity, and between\nscenes we are entertained by the\nsounds of \"The Beatles', 'Simon &\nGarfunkel', 'Procol Harem', etc.\nThe comic finale is the\nperformance of Pyramus and Thisbe\nby Bottom and his cohorts. This is\na wonderful celebration of amateur\ntheatrical s. The chilliness of the\nnight air is quite forgotten as we are\nbeset by muscle wrenching laughter. The spirit of Shakespeare\nis preserved, and yet we cannot\nrecognise it as Shakespeare.\nThe entertainment value cannot\nbe overstated. It is great fun.

The subtlety which\nHoffman injects into his poignant\n'Hath not a Jew eyes...' speech is\npure genius.

    "content": "Reviews\nFair Game Tap\nAt a time in cinema development\nwhen almost every movie can be\nbracketed, (as a baseball film, or a role reversal, and so on), Fair Game\nfalls into the category 'damned\npeculiar'.\nThe blurb says 'psychological\nthriller', but for much of the eighty\nminutes I was tempted to say\n'blurb!'. And at the end I left\nthinking' oh'. On reflection,\nhowever it wasn't that bad.\nThe cast numbers three, one of\nwhom takes an early bath after five\nminutes, when his deadly black\nmamba bites him. This allows the\nnasty, Gene, to take the snake and\nplay a trick on his estranged wife\nEva. He leaves it in her loft\napartment. Serves the bitch right for\nabandoning the possessive bastard.\nHa! What a wheeze.\nAnyway, it's one of those cat and\nmouse affairs. The mamba will die\nof its own poison in one hour. Eva\ndoesn't know this, but we do, and\nso does Gene, who, being a computer whizz, is tracking the\nprogress electronically.\nOn the face of it, tension and\nexcitement could be abundant if\nplayed correctly. Unfortunately\nGorgio Maroder's score attempts to\nsustain the anxiety for the full eighty\nminutes, rather than taking snaps at\nit every so often.\nGregg Henry plays Gene solidly,\nif a little two dimensionally, but he\nis threateningly oppressive. Trudie\nStyler is rather more efficient as Eva,\nand manages to show contempt,\nfear and strength despite a poor\nImagine a die hard collection of\nhoof ers from the thirties and forties\nrekindling some public support for\ntheir art by hopping on the talent\nband wag gon begun by Famel\nYou've got Tap! It's a pity the\nband wag gon ground to a halt a few\nyears back.\nIn the spirit of its contemporary\npredecessor there are ample\nopportunities in the script for the\ncast to break into a 'duelling banjos'\nroutine. It must be said that all\nconcerned are pretty good at tap\nMusic and dance, on tap.\nscript consisting mostly of 'fuck!'.\nWhere the film surpasses itself is\nin the set: a rumbling cascade of arty\nvisuals that makes up Eva's home.\n(She's a sculptress, you see.) No minimalist refuge of yuppie dom this, it's like an aircraft hanger, full\nof bits of other buildings, and even\ncomplete with mini-tropical rain\nforest. Quite appropriate\nconsidering Styler is Sting's girlfriend.\nAll in all it isn'ta bad attempt,\ngiven that it represents Italian\ndirector Maria Or fini's first\ninternational film. I find it hard to\nsee where the \u00a34 million went,\nthough. Compare it to the similarly\nbudgeted Nightmare on Elm Street 4\nand look at the effects they got for\ntheir money. Perhaps the snake\ncommands a large fee and slice of\nthe box office.\nFair Game will suffer from its\nblockbuster competition, proving\nthat drawing the crowds can often\ndancing, and not bad when it comes\nto acting either.\nGregory Hines takes the lead as\nMax Washington, an ex-con intent\non forgetting his tap roots. Sammy\nDavis Jr plays his surrogate father,\nan old-time dancer with dreams of\nre juv in a ting the craft. 'Nobody ever\ntap danced to rock music'. His daughter Amy provides the film\nwith love-hate romantic interest and\ngives Max the necessary Jiminy\nCricket conscience.\nThe plot, insofar as one exists,\ndeals with the conflicts in Max's character. He has the opportunity of\nrebuilding a life of crime with his old\nacquaintances in gangland, or he\ncan scrape a living on the stage.\nTough choice. What we have then\nis a pleasant journey of dilemma\nand solution, quandary and triumph.\nThe direction captures the moods\nof the various scenes as it flicks\neffortlessly from smooth\nphotography to erratic editing. As a platform for a particular talent Tap\nmatches the best music videos. As a piece of cinema art, it is well\nexecuted and quite enjoyable.\nBut with a potentially specific\naudience, much like Eastwood's Bird, I can only hope Columbia\nPictures believe in the script: 'It ain't what you earn that matters.'\nAndrew Clarke.\nbe an unfair game.

This is the maxim which\ndrives the major characters in MartinS harman' s new play. Personal insanity being the\ninevitable consequence of trying to\nmake sense of a mad world. Bewildered by pessimistic visions of\npersonal demise and global\napocalypse they are either driven or\ngladly volunteer to leap with gusto\ncompletely off their rockers.\nSuch a premise should make for\nsome very comic opportunities and\nthese are brought out in abundance\nhere. A little patience is required\nthough to await the full fruit it ion of\nthese as the slower first half of the\ndouble bill lazily sows the seeds.\nTo outline the plot in detail would\ndetract from this later reward. I therefore take my lead from the i excellent programme to the piece\nwhich tries, with great success, to\ngive a flavour of the two locations.\nThis is accomplished with quotes\nfrom Lawrence Durrell's The Greek\nIslands describing both Corfu and\nSantorini.\nThe essence of these images of\nlight and heat freezing a timeless\nsanctuary of Platonic immutability\nis captured brilliantly by Ultze's sun\nbaked sets and Gerry Jenkinson's magnesium bright lighting. The first\nset at Corfu has the greater\nwhitewashed intensity and with it\nthe greater stillness. The impression\nhere is less of a madhouse and more\nof an asylum. An asylum from the\ndemands of the outside world.\nOne of those seeking sanctuary\nhere is David (Rupert Graves). He is a young, painfully shy and artistic\nhomosexual American Jew. This\nmight seem a paro dic combination\nindeed it draws a few laughs in itself. One must only remember\nhowever that Sherman himself is all\nof these things but young to see that\nsympathy rather than stereotype is\nthe source of this character. The\nother protagonist is Mrs Honey\n(Vanessa Redgrave) an American\nspinster and a globe-trotting\neccentric. Losbos and Nikos are\nowner and waiter, respectively, of\nthis paradise pension and complete\nthe tranquil picture. But, add a little\nintrigue and events take as in sister turn.\nIn the Santorini based second half\nwe have really arrived in bedlam.\nFrom this madman's eyrie we are\ntreated to a fantastic view of the\nworld twenty four years on in 1990.\nThis panoramic parody of all things\nabsurd in the modern world must\nsurely be a vision of the paranoid.\nBut when you're laughing with\nmadmen you should be prepared\nfor a shock.\nPerformances in both part one and\npart two are exceptional for their\nmeasured restraint. Strong directing\nfrom Robert Allan Ackerman is\ndoubtless to be credited for this.\nParticularly outstanding is Arthur\nDignam as the crazy old man in part\ntwo. Mystical yet profound when\nanimated and convincingly vacant\nwhen crushed the man makes a natural n utter. See this now, it's an\nabsolute treat.\nMAC.\nPage 38 FELIX June 21 1989\n\n"

An anti loans\nlobby formed itself and operated\nunder the umbrella organisation\n'water polo club.' The lobby\npresented an Emergency General\nMeeting of the Union with a motion\nmandating the Union Executive to\npresent a petition against loans to a Parliamentary lobby in January and\ncalling for the Union to organise a half day strike, subject to approval\nby departmental ballot.\nOver 170 students turned up to\nthe lobby and, with the support of\nthe Rector and the Governing Body,\nmost academic departments\ncollaborated by cancelling lectures\nand tutorials. Before the lobby,\nChairman of the Conservative Party,\nMP Peter Brooke put forward the\nGovernment's point of view to the\nCollege. He argued that loans\nwould increase access to higher\ne ducat a ion, reduce pressure on the\nparental contribution.\nIn late January, there was much\nuproar when both the National\nUnion of Students (NUS) and the\nUniversity of London Union (ULU)\npulled out of an anti loans march\nscheduled for the first of February,\nbelieving that they did not have the\nresources to organise the march\nsafely. Imperial College Union soon\nfollowed suit. The organisation of\nthe march was taken over by\nmembers of the Federal Campaigns\nCommittee (FCC), an informal\ngroup set up by the UL U Presidents\nCouncil, and went ahead as planned\nwithout incident.\nBop against Baker\nIn February Imperial College\nUnion joined in an NUS National\nEducation Shutdown in protest to\nloans. The shutdown culminated\nwith 800 students gathering outside\nthe Department of Education and\nScience (DES). As part of the\nprotest, the London School of\nEconomics canceled lectures and\norganised a 'Bop against Baker',\nUniversity College organised a picket of the College's entrances,\nand an 'Overdraft' disco, Kings\nCollege organised a mail blockage,\nwhilst catering staff at Thames\nPolytechnic staged a one day strike.\nAt Imperial, MP Bernie Grant spoke\nto 50 students in the Union lounge\nwhile pool and table football\ntournaments were held and information sheets were distributed.\nThe union was disappointed that,\nbecause of a low turn out at the\nprevious NUS March, the College\nhad refused to rearrange lectures.\nIn March, the NUS staged its final\nanti loans march which was supported by the Association of\nUniversity Teachers and Imperial\nCollege. Over 35,000 students from\nall over the country formed a two\nmile procession, severely disrupting\nLondon's traffic.\nULU President resigns\nFrom external politics to internal\npolitics. January saw the resignation\nof UL U President, Stewart Jackson\nfollowing a narrowly defeated vote\nof no confidence in December. Mr Jackson's resignation followed\naccusations that he had taken no\naction to support the anti loans\nmarches, had failed to provide\nbriefings for members of the\nExecutive Senate, and that he had\nno regard for the UL U vice\npresidents.\nIn an interview with the Times\nEducational supplement, Mr Jackson said that he had resigned\nbecause of friction which had arisen\nbecause of his right wing views in\na left wing student's union.\n'Being a Conservative in student\npolitics is like being a fox at a beagle\nhunt' he said.\nBeijing massacre\nThe troubles in China in June\nsparked waves of sympathy from\nstudents in London. According to\npolice estimates, 4000 turned up to\na candlelit vigil outside of the\nChinese embassy to pay their\nrespects to the 7000 students killed\nin the Beijing massacre. Earlier on\nthe same day the NUS organised a demonstration attended by 1000\nstudents. The Imperial delegation\nplaced a wreath on the 'martyrs for\nfreedom memorial' and presented a petition of 756 signatures (including\nthe Rector Professor Eric Ash) calling for an end to the violence in\nChina to embassy officials.\nMeanwhile, students at Imperial\nsigned 432 letters which were\ndelivered to Sir Geoffrey Howe\ncalling for the British Government\nto openly condemn the actions in China. The College, for its part, set\nup a hardship fund for Chinese\nstudents with collection boxes\nplaced in refectories for contributors.\nGeology cutbacks\nThe University Grants\nCommittee's( UGC) decision to\ndowngrade the Geology department in January provoked a strong reaction from members of\nstaff who claimed that the UGC had\nused unfair criteria when making\ntheir assessment.\nThe department had been told to\nlose 10 academic staff and 13 non\nacademic staff and to reduce its\nannual undergraduate intake from\n45 to 32 by October 1989. The\ncutbacks are likely to lead to the\ndepartment having to axe four year\ncourses and to reduce the number\nof options available to second year\ngeologists from 7 to 3.\nAcademics in the department\nwere critical of the UGC' s alleged\nuse of the Science Citation Index as\na means of assessing the quantity of\nresearch at Imperial. They argued\nthat the index does not take into\naccount many of the journals which\npublish the work from applied\nGeology Departments such as\nImperial.

As soon as term ends you should\nregister as unemployed at your\nnearest Unemployment Benefit\nOffice. As the summer term ends on\nFriday the earliest you will be able\nto register will be Monday June 26.\nTo find your nearest U BO you\nshould look in the phone book\nunder Employment, Dept of. The\noffices are usually only open\nbetween 9.30am3.30 pm so do not\nleave too late in the day to go to\nregister. When you go to the U BO. you should take your National\nInsurance card and if you have ever\nworked before, your P45.\n2. When you register you will have\nto complete various forms and you\nwill be told about arrangements for\nsigning, how benefit will be paid\netc. One of the forms you will have\nto complete is a UB671. This form\nincludes a questionnaire designed to\ntest your availability for work. A person's 'availability for work' is\ncentral to his or her claim for benefit.\nIt is therefore most important that\nyou answer the questions correctly\notherwise you could jeo pardi se your\nclaim, the questions with suggested\nanswers are shown here.\n3. When you register you should\nalso be given aBl form to claim\nIncome Support. There are two\nreasons for this:\n\u2022 As a student it is unlikely that you\nwill have paid sufficient National\nInsurance Contributions to qualify\nfor Unemployment Benefit.\n\u2022It takes several weeks to get a person's National Insurance record\nchecked so it is usual for most\npeople to claim Income Support for\nat least part of the time that they are\nunemployed.\nWhen you have completed the Bl you must send it to the DSS Office\nthat covers your address. The U BO staff will be able to tell you which\none it is. Make sure before you send\nthe form that you have answered all\nthe questions and enclosed any\nproof required.\nIt is then a question of waiting for\nthe DSS to process your claim. It\nshould be processed within 14 days\nof being received in the office but in\npractise it is usually much longer. If\nyou are concerned about your claim\nthen you must contact the DSS. If\nyou have no success then seek\nadvice. Don't just assume that your\nclaim is being dealt with as it is\nalways possible that your claim was\nnever received in the first place or\nthe DSS may have written to you\nand you failed to get their letter for\nsome reason.\nAlthough you will most likely be\nOne of the options: working behind the union Bar.\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 35\n\n"

    "content": "Interview\n'There is nothing\nsacrosanct'\nWhat is it like to be an. journalist investigating news stories like the\ngovernment's abuse of the Data Protection Act or the race for the discovery\nof the AIDS virus. Steve Connor is a science reporter on the Daily\nTelegraph, has worked on Computing Magazine and New Scientist and\nhas written books on both of the s fe subjects. Liz Warren went to the\nTelegraph building to interview hit n. How did you get involved in\njournalism?\nWhen I left university, I got on to\na graduate training scheme run by\nHaymarket Publishing. This\ninvolved both theory and practice\nworking on different magazines. I then worked on the technical press\npublished by Haymarket which was\nlater sold to a Dutch publishing\nhouse called V NU. After three years\nthere I joined New Scientist for six\nyears and then moved to the\nTelegraph.\nWhat was it that attracted you to\njournalism?\nI did a Zoology degree which is an\nunusual science because it's more\nliterate than mathematical. I 've\nalways enjoyed the writing part of\nscience but not the laboratory work.\nWhen I left University thinking\nwhat the hell to do, I felt that rather\nthan do something boring that\nmakes a lot of money, I'd do\nsomething which is a bit more risky\nand exciting.\nWhat do you think makes a 'good'\nnews story?\nThat's very difficult. From the\ncynical viewpoint, a good news\nstory's one that you can sell to your\nnews desk but very often some of\nthe best news stories don't get\npassed to the news desk.\nWhere do good stories initially\ncome from?\nFrom absolutely anywhere. There's no set formula. Stories can come\nfrom talking to people, from reading\nscientific literature or other\nnewspapers or press releases. You. can't control news. It happens and\nthere are angles to which specialists\nsuch as myself can take. If a plane\nfalls out of the sky then the general\nreporters will be on to it in terms of\nhow many dead, whereas I 'll be\nlooking at it from the angle of what\nwent wrong.\nHow do you actually set about\nresearching a news story once\nyou've got that initial information\nabout it?\nBy far the best tool every journalist\nhas is a telephone. You call whoever\nyou think has the information which\nyou want. If I had to put a ratio on\nit I think 80 % of my work is on the\ntelephone and 20% is reading.\nHow do you build up contacts in\nthe areas that you're interested in?\nYou just do build up contacts.\nBecause you speak to a lot of people\nyou come across people who can\ngive information and are very\nknowledgeable about their subject.\nIt happens in a natural way. You\ndon't have to ply them with drinks\nor take them for meals, a though sometimes that helps. Sometimes\nit's difficult to get information but\nI'm always surprised at how people\nwill help the press.\nWhat would you say is the biggest\nstory you've ever worked on?\nThe biggest story I first came across\nwould be a story which I wrote with\nDuncan Campbell about the\ndiscovery of the MI5 computer in\nMay fair. That was a very big story\nfor me then because it got picked up\nby all the nationals and on radio.\nThe impact of that was that I suddenly realised that I could affect\nthe news by what I wrote. More\nrecently, the feature for New Scientist about the discovery of the\nAIDS virus and the row between the\nFrench and American scientists over\nwho discovered it and who had\nproprietor i al rights.\nHave you ever been warned off a story while you've been researching\nit?\nAll the time. It varies from people\nwho say,'don't write anything yet,\nbecause it's going to be a much\nbigger story'. Generally you are\ntalking to people who are naive of\nthe way the news gathering process\nworks. They don't understand that\nif there's something in the public\ndomain there's nothing to stop\npeople writing about it. But that's very mild, that's just naivety. At times you do get threats of legal\naction warning you off publication\nwhich you should take seriously but\nyou shouldn't let them unduly\ninfluence the way you go about\ndoing things. Every story demands\naccuracy and that you speak to all\nsides on controversial issues. I 've\nalso had verbal threats, but nothing\nvery serious\nSo you've never had any physical\nthreats?\nNot really, no. There are journalists\nwho can have a gun put to their\nhead or whatever. I 've never been\nin that position, because I 've never\nreally covered that sort of story but\nevents in China really do highlight\nthe sort of threats that journalists\ncan come across.\nWould you protect the\nconfidentiality of your sources even\nif it meant breaking the law, for\nexample by holding back\ndocuments?\nWell as I understand it journalists\ncan protect their sources without\nbreaking the law. The short answer\nto that is that the two are not\nnecessarily incompatible. I would\nprotect the confidentiality of my sources and I have to, but I don't think, at the moment anyway, the\nsystem in this country is such that\nyou have to break the law. But you\nhave to guard against that situation\narising.\nWould you feel it justified to break\nthe law to get information for a story, by for example breaking and\nentering?\nNo. It is not worth committing a crime to get information. There is no\nneed for it. The official secrets act,\nwhich is no longer in force, was\nquite a blunderbuss in its approach.\nBy encouraging civil servants to give\nyou information you were\ntechnically in breach of it, but that's no longer the case. The new bill\ngoing through Parliament is much\nmore sinister in the sense that by\nsimply writing about things which\nthe government deems secret you\nwill be technically in breach of the\nlaw.\nWhen you have a government\nwhich is putting stringent controls\non the press you've got to decide\nwhether it's in the public interest to\npublish something while at the\nsame time running the risk of\nprosecution. If there is something\nwhich you really do feel is in the\npublic interest and you' ve convinced your editors and they\nand the publishing company are\nwilling to run the risk, then of\ncourse I would publish. But ultimately it's the publishers and the\neditors who will make that decision.\nHow justified do you think the\ngovernment is in using legislation\nto stop the publishing of\n'embarrassing' material?\nThere is a need to protect secrets\nwhich need to be kept for national\nsecurity. The problem is national\nsecurity has never been defined. It's used as a blanket term to cover\nanything which could be\nembarrassing to the government. I think the term really does have to\nbe hammered out and defined\nclearly. Anything which is part of\nnational security then obviously has\nto have classification. I do believe\nAS*** June 21 1989 FELIX Page 27\n\n"

    "content": "Science\nSatellites\non a string\nby Mike Morton\nSpace tethers have been described\nas 'the discovery of the wheel in space'. Although the concept is far\nfrom new, it is unfamiliar to many,\n'probably because no space mission\nusing it has ever been launched. The\nbasic idea is quite simple (see box):\ntwo satellites in different orbits will\nassume a stable configuration if they\nare connected by a long cable (of the\norder of 10's of km), and will orbit\ntogether with the cable along the\nradius of the orbit. This simple trick\nof orbital mechanics will have a huge impact on almost all aspects\nof space exploitation, making it both\nsimpler and cheaper.\nLate next year, the first of three\nmissions of the joint US-Italian TSS\nproject (tethered satellite systems)\nwill be launched. This will involve\nthe deployment and subsequent\nretrieval of an Italian built satellite\nfrom a space shuttle orbiter. The\nreusable, modular satellite has a mass of around 500 kg and is\npowered by silver-zinc batteries. As the satellite will only be deployed\nfor about 20 hours so solar cells\nwould be unnecessary. The satellite\nwill carry a variety of instruments,\nmostly concerned with investigating\nthe electric and magnetic fields of\nthis region, however the main\nobjective of the programme is to\nsimply demonstrate the feasibility of\ntethered satellites in space.\nThe first and third TSS missions\nwill involve deploying the satellite\nupwards from the shuttle, in it ally' Artist's impression of\nTSS\nThe Pull of Gravity\nGravity pulls more strongly on objects closer to the earth's surface.\nEverybody weighs slightly more on the ground then they do at the\ntop of a tall building. This effect is the basis for space tethers.\nImagine two satellites in separate orbits around a planet (A); according to Newtonian mechanics they would much rather be\nmoving in a straight line. To make them move in a circular orbit a force of some kind must act on them. This is provided by the gravity\nof the planet. As the inner satellite experiences a stronger gravitational\nforce it is able to move with greater velocity on an orbit with a smaller\nradius; it takes less time to complete one orbit.\nThis is summarised by Kepler's third law which states:\nWhere K is a constant, T is the time to complete one orbit and R is\nthe radius of the orbit. Imagine the two satellites are connected by\na cable (B). The cable has a tension because the lower satellite is\nforced to slow down and the upper one is forced to speed up. The\nupper one will want to rise and the lower one will want to fall but\nthey will exactly balance, producing the tension in the cable and\nallowing the stability of the system.\nThe orbital period of the system will depend on the position of the\ncentre of mass, and is the time in which a free flying object will orbit\nif it where at the position of the centre of mass.\nIf the cable is suddenly cut, the upper satellite will be boosted into\na higher orbit and the lower satellite will drop into a lower orbit (C). This trick is known as momentum scrounging because it is based on\nthe principle of conservation of angular momentum and is one of the\npossible practical applications of tether systems.\nSlower, higher Sped-up satellite Satellite moves\nsatellite wants to rise toward higher orbit\nFaster, lower Slowed satellite Satellite moves\nsatellite wants to fall toward lower orbit\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

The\ndeal is set to earn the Union in excess of \u00a312,000 per annum.\nAt the beginning of the year the\nCareers service budget was cut back\nby \u00a310,000. This coincided with an\nextra \u00a310,000 for a new secretary for\nthe HUB office, run by the Rector's wife, Clare Ash. The move provided leverage for\nthe Union to persuade the College\nto pay for a part time Welfare\nAdviser.

If the proposals go ahead, rent\nincreases in South Kensington may\nbe smaller in the future, according\nto College Secretary, John Smith.\nMr Smith's proposals were\nanounced to students at Silwood\nPark on last Monday. He recommends that the cost of a new\nhall of residence at Silwood Park be\nmet by a \u00a3500,000 College loan over\n25 years at a fixed rate of 9% interest\nper annum. The idea has the\napproval of students at Silwood\nPark who objected to the College's original proposal of a loan over 20\nyears at 12.5% per annum.\nSilwood Park student Chairman,\nIan Lowles told FELIX that the\noriginal plans would have meant\n'quite a substantial rent increase.'\nThe new proposals, he says, will\nallow for increases in line with\nsurrounding Colleges. The plans, he\nadded, will mean that the College\nis effectively sub sidi sing the new\nhall.\nMr Smith pointed out that the\nLaw prevents the College from\ndirectly funding residences. He added that his proposals could\nmean that students would lose out\nif interest rates were to fall in the\nfuture, although they presently\nstood to gain.\nThe new hall will allow the\nCollege to house undergraduate\n\"students on short courses separately\nto permanent postgraduate\nresidents. It is hoped that the new\narrangement will prevent\ndisturbances between the two groups which have arisen in the\npast.\nMr Smith's proposals include the\ndevelopment of a Conference\nCentre at Silwood Park. His original\nproposals were rejected by the\nGovernors at a College Finance and\nExecutive meeting in May due to\npressure from students over the\nresidence arrangements and fears\nthat the plans for the Conference\nCentre could be financially unstable.\nMr Smith now hopes that the\nSilwood Science Park Company,\n'Impact', will run the Conference\nCentre.\n'Impact' raises \u00a3200,000 per year\nfor the College. The new plans\nrecommend that this money be used\nas a basis upon which to develop the\nConference Centre.\nAlthough Mr Smith feels that the\nCollege may 'lose out a bit' initially,\nhe told FELIX that the Centre is ' An absolute winner.' He hopes to see\nclubs, societies and departments\nusing the Centre at weekends as its\ncatering facilities improve.\nOn your\nbike!\nThe University of London Careers\nAdvisory Service is holding a 'London Recruitment Fair' on5 th and 6th July at the Businesss Design\nCentre in Islington.

Imperial College's Careers Office\noffers a range of literature on employers as well as a Careers\nAdviser and other services.\nThe Careers Office has received a cut of \u00a33000 to its budget for next\nyear as well as a \u00a310000 cut this year.\nAnother\nBloody\nSabbatical\nUnion President Nigel Baker\noutlined his ideas for a fourth\nexecutive sabbatical at Monday's Joint Union Council. As a second\nDeputy President the new post\nwould be responsible for all aspects\nof student welfare. Members of the\nmeeting are to submit suggestions\nas to what Mr Baker should do with\nhis ideas by July 15.\nAccommodation office\ngets new dictionary\nThe College's Accommodation Office has 'no sense of the word\nurgency' when allocating students\nfor rooms over the Summer according to Lesley Rose in the\nCollege's Cash Office. Mrs Rose is\nin charge of the billing of students,\nwho must pay for Summer accommodation by the end of term.\nStudents are expected to receive\nbills, notifying them of their place\nthis Summer by today. Mrs Rose\ntold FELIX that many of the\nstudents involved are postgraduates\nwho are required to give notice of\ntheir departure from term time\naccommodation. She is concerned\nthat many students will receive\nnotification of their place in hall with\ntoo little notice.\nCollege Accommodation Officer,\nLoretto O 'Callaghan told FELIX that\nthe staff in the office had been\nworking hard for three weeks on the\nallocations.

Chevy Chase takes\nthe title role, a resourceful eccentric,\nplagued by his wife's alimony\ndemands. The inheritance of his\naunt's Louisiana plantation\nprovides a way out for Fletch, a murder mystery, and as Cilia would\nsay, a lotta laughs.\nChas swans through all this,\ndigging up clues from behind the\nvarious disguises he sports and\nwearing an amiable grin at all times.\nSmall effort is required to rekindle\nhis past roles in the same type of\nself-parody which accompanies\nsuch actors as John Cleese. An ecologically sound script with Video\nCoincidental to other big screen\nreleases listed here, two of the major\nvideos issued this month star\nTimothy Dalton and Chevy Chase.\nHawks has Dalton cast as a British\nLawyer, Bancroft, who meets\nAnthony Edwards, a terminally ill\nAmerican football player, while they\nshare a ward in hospital.\nThey need a diversion to make\ntheir lives bearable, and what better\nadventure than stealing an ambulance and making a dash for\nthe brothels of Amsterdam. The\ncombination of serious backdrop\nand humourous plot pigeon-hole\nthis movie squarely in the realms of\nthe black comedy.\nFunny Farm is another ideal\nplatform for Chevy Chase, just like\nall his other films. The inimitable\nblend of satire and farce is this time\nset against the old plot device,\nwriter's block.\nIn escaping the city, Chase and his\nwife, Madolyn Smith, discover an\nidyllic Utopia, full of folksy charm in\nthe mountain village of Redbud. But\nRedbud has more eccentrics than\neven New York.\nOkay, so the plot is a tad thin, but\nthe script is written by Jeffrey Boam,\nauthor of Innerspace and The Lost\nBoys, so it is almost certain to be\ngood. A strong support cast and the\nbenign charm of the lead indicate an\nessential rental.\nAndrew Clarke.\nsufficient humour makes this are commendable film. Highlight is a set-piece dream sequence, a satirical\nversion of Disney's Song of the\nSouth, complete with cast of\nthousands and cavorting animated\ndog.\nDreams of another kind are the\nbasis for the fourth Nightmare on Elm\nStreet, entitled The Dream Master. A hound from hell urinates fire on\nFreddy Krueger's grave and this\nresults in another re sure c tion for old\npizza face. His first move of course\nis to wipe out all the kids in a multitude of inventive ly gory ways.\nThe heroine is Alison, a credible\nperformance by newcomer Lisa\nWilcox, who proves to be a mixture\nof Bruce Lee and Jane Fonda. Robert\nEngland is once again excellent as\nFreddy; the sharpness of his wit\nmatched only by his clawed glove.\nThe \u00a33 million budget allows some\nimpressive effects to spice up what\nwould otherwise be a predictably\ndrab affair. No doubt the most easily\nanticipated scene though is the final\nhook from which Nightmare 5 can be\nhung.\nAlso doing the rounds at the\nmoment is Cocoon: The Return. A more conventional sequel in that it\nfalls way short of its predecessor.\nNot that the original was in any way\nspectacular. There are at least as\nmany sub-plots as characters and\nyet for all that it lacks a principal\nstoryline, leaving the impression\nthat none of the characters really\ndoes anything.\nSteve Guttenberg repeats the\nalien intercourse of the original\nminutes of epic cinema, 20 of which\nare previously unseen. Gloriously\ncolourful and magnificently\nperceptive, David Lean's masterpiece is a benchmark for all\nother big budget movies. Star of the\nshow, Peter O 'Toole, launched his\ncareer here, and went on to make\nsuch classics as Caligula and High\nSpirits. The film is showing at the\nOdeon, Marble Arch, and absolutely nowhere else.\nShowing nowhere, but the\nCurzon, West End is Paris by Night.\nFew releases have better timing than\nthis one\u2014it's about Euro MPs and\nsome of the things they do. Charlotte Rampling is the MEP in\nquestion, and aside from blackmail,\nmurder and a steamy affair, she has\nan alcoholic hubby to cope with.\nMichael Gambon is wasted in this\nrole.\nThe criticism of Thatcherite\nmorality may be a salient topic, but\nit cannot rescue an otherwise dreary\nthriller, which is anything but\nthrilling. It should be said that\nRampling is able to maintain her\ncareer motif of sexual entanglement,\nand a consistency of performance on\nthat level cannot be wholly ignored.\nElsewhere, an unchanging style is\npresent in Tom Holland's new film\nChild's Play. All of Holland' s previous films have been a remake\nof the boy who cried wolf tale. Here\nthe narrative has reached its absurd\nlimit, as the ' wolf turns out to be\na child's freckle faced doll called\nChucky, recently possessed by the\nspirit of a dead voodoo murderer.\nYou believe me, don't you?\nWell, Hello Dolly.\nCocoon, and his partner Tahnee\nWelch shows that she got the part\nmore through her mother's name\nthan her acting ability. This is one\nto see when you've seen everything\nelse, and puked some more in Southside.\nAt the other end of the spectrum\nis the newly restored Lawrence of\nArabia. The obsessive work of two\nenthusiasts has resulted in216 The predictability and repetition\ninvolved are overcome by some\ngood effects, most specifically the\npuppet, Chucky, in nine different\nforms and worked by an army of\npuppeteers. The result is a modest\nhorror flick with just enough blood\nto make you chucky up py, even\nwhen Southside affects you no\nmore.\nAndy Clarke\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 37\n\n"

The sort of\nquestions they might ask are:\n-Will I be able to get a job?\n-Should I stay in London or go\nhome\n-If I don't work can I claim any\nBenefit?\n-Can I claim Housing Benefit if I'm working?\nThe aim of this article is to look at\nthe different options available and\nwhat they involve.\n'Summer in the city' or at home?\nSome students only rent their\naccommodation during the\nacademic year and tend to return to\nstay with their parents over the\nSummer. Others will be keeping on\ntheir accommodation in order to\ncontinue living there into the next\nacademic year. If you will be leaving\nyour current address at the end of\nterm and are undecided about\nwhere to spend the summer you\nshould ask yourself the following\nquestions:\n\u2022 DoI want to spend the whole\nsummer with my family?\n\u2022 Can I get a job easily if I go home?\n\u2022 How much more will I be able to\nsave if I go home?\n\u2022 How much can I earn if I stay in London or if I went to another\ntown?\n\u2022 How much will I be able to save\nif I stayed in London or went\nelsewhere after allowing for living\nand accommodation expenses?\nThere are some obvious financial\nadvantages to spending the summer\nat home, however temporary jobs in\nLondon tend to be better paid so\nyou might end up saving more by\nstaying London or by going to\nanother area where there is better\npaid employment.\nClaiming Housing Benefit over the\nSummer\nAnyone claiming Housing Benefit at\npresent will know that their claim\nwill be closed at the end of the\nsummer term. This is because the\nassessment of a student claim only\napplies to the 'period of study'.\nOnce the Summer term finishes\nmost students will have completed\ntheir studies for the year and are no\nlonger in receipt of 'student income'\n(usually an LEA grant) and in order\nto continue to receive Housing\nBenefit a new claim will have to be\nmade based on the student's circumstances over the summer.\nThere are three situations in which a student might claim HB over the summer:\n1. If you are working and paying\nrent then you can claim HB based\non your earnings. This option is\nequally open to those in College\nowned accommodation who cannot\nclaim HB during the period of\nstudy. This is because the rules\nregarding this type of\naccommodation do not apply during\nthe summer vacation. Anyone applying for HB when working\nmust bear in mind that they are only\nlikely to qualify if earnings are quite\nlow, see box 1:\nStudent aged 18-24, paying rent of \u00a350.1\nMaximum amount of net earnings before HB entitlement\nceases\nHousing Benefit payable on rent \u00a350 and earnings of \u00a399\nStudent aged 18-24, paying rent of \u00a360.00 pw\nMaximum amount of net earnings\nHB Payable\nStudent aged 25+, rent \u00a350\nMaximum amount net earnings\nHB payable\nStudent aged 25*, rent \u00a360\nMaximum amount net earnings\nHB payable\n0.71p= \u2022 U.v hp.106.00,/1 nt\nA*>3p After getting your benefit, this will seem easy.\nObviously the less you earn the\nhigher your Housing Benefit will be.\nSo if you are working and your\nearnings are within the above levels\nor your rent is higher than \u00a360.00\npw it is worth making a claim. It is\nalso worth claiming if you are doing\nagency work where your earnings\nfluctuate or you have weeks without\nwork. The Housing Benefit Dept can\nassess your claim based on average\nearnings. If you are going to claim\nthis should be done as soon as you\nstart work. You can get a claim form\nfrom the Housing Benefit Office for\nyour area or if you are in London\nfrom the Welfare Office.\n2. If you are absent from your\naccommodation at any time over the\nsummer eg to go on holiday you\nmay be able to claim HB while you\nare away. So that someone who has\nbeen working and does not qualify\nfor HB could be entitled for the\nperiod he/she is away. Entitlement\nin this situation will depend on whether or not your main reason for\noccupying your accommodation is\nfor the purpose of studying. DSS\nadvise that attendance on the course\nshall not normally be regarded as\nthe main purpose of occupying the\nhome if a student:\n\u2022 Lived in the accommodation\nbefore the beginning of the course;\nor\n\u2022 has a child or young person living\nwith him or her; or\n\u2022 is aged 25 or over and has no other\naccommodation; or\n\u2022is under 25 and has no parent or\nguardian and no other\naccommodation.\nIf you are not sure whether this rule\naffects you or not you should seek\nadvice. If you decide to make ac liam for the period you are away you\nmust do so before you go. If you\nwill have no income during the\nperiod you are away it is quite in order to state on your claim from\nthat your income is ' NIL'.3. If you are unable to get a job in\ntime for the start of the vacation it\nis likely you will be signing on as\nunemployed and claiming Unemployment Benefit and/or\nIncome Support. If you are paying\nrent you will also be able to get HB. In the section on Unemployment\nBenefit and Income Support I will\nexplain how HB is claimed in this\nsituation.\nPage 34 FELIX June 21 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nWashing accounts in public\nTom Yates argues for external bank accounts\nThose of you who avidly read the\nU GM reports, or (odder still) read\nthe Union Officers' Reports, may\nhave noticed that the Union has\ndecided it's in favour of external\nbank accounts for individual societies. This may seem a small\nthing, but judging by the hassle it\ncreated in its passing and the fuss\nmade by the Union throughout,\nsuch an impression is mistaken.\nHere I hope to familiaris e people\nwith the existing system, and hence\nto try to outline the advantages of\nthe proposed system. Getting it\npassed by the Union was the easiest\nstage in the birth of such a system.\nGetting College to agree to it will be\nvery much harder, and I hope to\noutline what I perceive to be the\nreasons for this also.\nWhere do we stand now?\nIf you' ve never been closely\ninvolved with a club or society then\nyou probably don't realise how much red tape a society has to live\nwith in order to get access to what\nthe Union concedes is 'its money',\nbeing the money generated by the\nsociety in the pursuit of its activities,\nthrough ticket sales, membership,\nfundraising events and more. Such\nmonies must be banked with the\nUnion, then to draw on them the\nsocieties must come once a week to\nthe Union Office where the\nappropriate Honorary Senior\nTreasurer will pay out of the\nrespective Union account upon\npresentation of receipts to his\nsatisfaction. Should the society wish\nto buy anything, whether big or\nsmall, a society member must pay\nfor it from his own pocket, then be\nrefunded at the convenience of the\nUnion. Certainly, it is possible to\nuse a Union Order Form (if you can\nfind an MSC Chairman to sign it),\nbut many firms will not handle pro\nforma invoicing, especially for the\nsums involved in the average society\ntransaction.\nWhere would we stand under the\nnew plan?\nAt the top of the year, the society\ncommittee would meet and specify\nto the treasurer what the money in\nthe external ac cont could and could\nnot be spent on. Then, as and when\nthe money needed to be spent on such things, the Treasurer and Chairman would sign a cheque for\nthe amount, either to the creditor\ndirect, or to a society member who\nwould foot the bill but could get\nrepayment then and'there. Should\nmoney need to be spent on something not already approved by\nthe committee, then they just meet\nand authorise it, possibly as a class\nof payment ot be generally\napproved in future.\nWhat's to stop fraud?\nPrimarily, the Executive of a society\nare people who work for their\nsociety, not for its downfall. Note\nalso that the account is over viewed by the MSC that administers the\nsociety, who retain the power to\nfreeze the account should anything\nuntoward occur. Nothing will stop\nthe really determined fraud ster, but\nnothing can stop him now either\u2014\nnor will any but the most\nridiculously rigid system\u2014so there's no increase in risk for a great\nadvance in society freedom.\nSounds Good. What's the problem?\nThe core problem is it's never been\ndone before\u2014here, and it should\ncome as no surprise to find the\npowers that be at IC being\nnotoriously conservative. But it\nworks quite happily at many other\nBritish universities, who are happy\nto treat societies as collections of\nstudents pursuing a common interest, rather than as a multiplicity\nof small businesses. College will\nprobably oppose this on exactly the\nsame grounds\u2014that it doesn't fit in\nwith established business practice,\nnot auditing, etc. etc.\u2014but these are\nfal a cio us grounds. Societies aren't like little versions of NatWest Bank,\nthey're just too small to apply these\nmethods to. Ask an accountant to\naudit an account with an annual\nturnover of \u00a3400 and he'll laugh at\nyou\u2014all the way to the bank. If\nother objections exist, then it'll be\ninteresting to hear them. But none\nhave come up in the past eight\nmonths (this has been brewing for\na while now!) and I suspect none\nwill.\nWhat if College won't play ball?\nIf the only reasons against this are\nthe not-good-business-practice type,\nand it's going to founder on that,\nthen it may be worth considering\ndisobedience. The Union already\nhas the power to grant external bank\naccounts of any unregulated type if\nthey choose to do so, and are merely\nadvised not to do it without good\ncause, so there's some precedent for\nthis already. Some have said that in\nthe end, College have the final say.\nBut this is not really true. It seems\nunlikely that the Union would hit\nanything bigger than choppy water\nthrough pursuing this to the end,\nand if you, the electorate, find the\narguments of College\nunsatisfactory, the Union can be\ninstructed to proceed with the\nscheme regardless. This is\ninflammatory, of course, and a negotiated solution would be highly\ndesirable, but I urge you not to let\nthis action be stopped by irrelevant\nobjections.\nChas' rebuttal\nFinally\nOh good, the end. I'm not a great\none for arguing in public, and this\nonly ever came out because it had\nto, so I'm not going to waste space\nand time pursuing any half-baked\narguments through the pages of\nFELIX. There's quite a lot more\nbump h about this than appears\nhere, and if you really want to argue\nabout it, or feel you've a valid point\nto make, at least come and get the\nsmall print from me first, I live in room 6M69 Huxley and amon x6776. Any letters in the weeks to\ncome that aren't written on a full\ndeck are going to be ignored!\nThose of you who lie the idea,\nplease don't let it die.\nTom Yates\nWhen we went up to the Union Office to ask Chas where his reply to this\narticle was, he denied all knowledge of it. So, we picked up the nearest\nthing we could find to fill the space. This may paint a clearer picture of\nthe Deputy President's job function\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 15\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nscience, could most certainly make\nthe grade as professional musicians.\nYet it remains true that there are\nmany who are untouched by the\nsports, the politics, micro and\nmacro, by the social life of the\nCollege. It is true that Imperial\nCollege would be a better place if\nmore could be persuaded to\nparticipate. The theory that we are\nexacerbating the problem by our\nstudent selection procedures does\nnot bear examination. We are\ncertainly doing much more\ninterviewing than we did three\nyears ago. But there would be no\npoint in selecting for social graces at\nthe expense of academic\nperformance. It would be totally\nirresponsible were we to accept\nstudents who would then have\ndifficulty in following our, admittedly exceedingly tough,\ncourses.\nOf course it helps if, like St Mary's there are 25 viable applicants for\nevery place. The selectors there (as\namply displayed in a series of TV programmes) are able to go for\nacademic excellence\u2014plus some\nadditional talent. Their students'\nsuccess in sports and in the arts is\nstriking. It would help the whole of\nImperial College a great deal if we\ncould engender closer contact\nbetween the t wo Unions. The\nobstacles, as far as I can understand\nthem, appear to be of a somewhat\ntheological nature. Once again k.a. is not going to get us over that\nhurdle.\nI get the impression that Dave\nBurns divides non-academic\npursuits into Good Things and Bad\nThings. Visiting museums and\ntheatres I read as Bad; rowing is\ntolerated; but it is \"student activity\naround the College\" that seems to\nearn his accolade. But why choose?\nBeer, partners and song are not\nalternatives. They can prove\nmutually supportive even, in moderation of course, supportive of\nthe academic work.\nSo how can we achieve a greater\nparticipation? I would suggest a good start might be for the\nIt was different in my day\nHas the Rector missed the boat?\ncommanding heights of the student\nbody\u2014the Union and FELIX\u2014to\ndevote themselves more to that\ncause. I have not found much in FELIX towards this end. Too much\nof the time one gets the impression\nof a rather small number of people\nconversing, all too often ascribing\nthe worst possible motives to each\nother in the process. Now there are\nsome people in the world who really\nare b.... ds, but, when you examine\nthe situation carefully not really that\nmany. If one starts with the\ntentative assumption that most\npeople are not b.... ds, it can do\nwonders for getting things done such as recruiting our students, to\nour society.\nThe students could do a lot\u2014but\nso could we, on the academic staff.\nOur abortive discussions with\nRH B NC contained an element of\nthis thinking. A future with RH B NC would indeed have changed\nImperial College\u2014but then change\nis the only certainty, nostalgia for\none's youth the main deter r rent. It\ndid not come off, for a number of\npractical reasons\u2014but I think it was\nworth probing.\nA major departure, which I believe will have beneficial effects on\nour community, is the incidence of\nfour-year courses, with one year to\nbe spent abroad. My personal guess\nis that such courses will become\navailable in most departments; that\na very significant fraction of the\nstudents will opt to join them.\nMore immediately there is a growing recognition that not only\nare our courses intellectually very\ndemanding\u2014they should be\u2014but\nthey are also stuffed full of too much\nmaterial. At base, it is the result of\nworking in fields in which knowledge and understanding is\naccumulating with such frightening\nspeed. It would not be a problem in\na Department of Greek Philology.\nThe temptation is to respond by\nputting more into the courses. The\nproblem was highlighted by the\nUndergraduate Studies Committee.\nHappily, remedial pruning is\nprogressing rapidly throughout the\nCollege. It should yield some more\nwaking hours, which could be\ndevoted to non-academic\npursuits....\nDave Burns concludes with an\ninspiring coda. I am glad that he has\n\"fallen in love with the place...\",\nthough I would suggest that he\nmight try to be just a shade less\ncritical of anyone else he might fall\nin love with next. I am glad that he\nhas such a vivid sense for the history\nof the College; that he retains good\nmemories.\nWhich takes me to my title. Why leave? True there is that degree to\ntake away; there is the Sponsor who\nhas been patiently awaiting your\nmaturity, for you to take your place\nin the defence of the nation. But the\ncontribution which you could make\nto the College now, as an alumnus,\nis enormous. You may, for a while,\nuntil that first grey hair appears,\nhave more opportunities to\ninfluence Union thinking than you\ndid from the hustings. We desperately need young talent in the\nAlumnus Association. Yes, we are\nasking them for money\u2014for the\nvery first time (with student housing\none of the main aims...). But we\nwant a lot more from alumni than\ntheir financial support. We want\ntheir active participation towards\nretaining and enhancing the\nacademic reputation of the College,\ntowards making it a more exciting\nplace to study, inspiring it towards\nproviding greater opportunities for\na fuller existence, for everyone who\nis of our community.\nEric A Ash June 14, 1989\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 17\n\n"

A black steel\njutting and blood red walls put us\nin the mood for a tragedy rather\nthan a light-hearted comedy. Maybe\nsomeone had forgotten that King\nLear had ended its run.\nUnfortunately, the scenery\nactually gets much worse, as the\nplay moves into the forests of\nArden. We expect green grass, a brook, and a stage drenched in a cheerful summer light. We are\ntreated to dirt brown soil, poor\nlighting, a collapsed view of the\nwoodland through a tunnel, and a single stuffed stag. It becomes even\nmore horrific when side panels are\nuncovered to reveal reams of graf it ri professing Orlando's love for\nRosalind.\nThe tone of the play, in general,\nis so slow that it is left wanting. The\notherwise satisfactory Karl Johnson\nas Jacques, delivers his ' All the\nworld's a stage...' Speech with such\nsolemnity that one feels like\nsleeping through it rather than\nmarvelling at it. It is only when\nRosalind and Orlando perform their\nrapid repartee that the play captures\na mood and atmosphere of\nenchantment.\nIn fact, what saves the play is the\nexcellence with which the lead roles\nare handled. Fiona Shaw's Rosalind\nis the heart of the play. She has to\nplay a girl acting as a boy acting as\na girl. It is a part of such complexity\nand intricacy that to see Fiona Shaw\npull it off so adeptly was a joy. She\nis given good support by Adam Kote as a naive, boyishly charming\nOrlando.\nIt is to the full credit of these two\nleads that the text of Shakespeare\nshines through despite the\nabhor ation of a set.\nGhetto\nNational Theatre\nProductions\nHamlet\nAs reviewed in last week's issue,\nDaniel Day Lewis gives ames me rising performance in Richard Eyre's elaborate production\nof Shakespeare's greatest work. The\ndepth and appeal lies in the\ncomplicated and ironic character of\nHamlet, which is not lost to the scale\nof the production. Judy Dench and\nMichael Byrant head a powerful\nsupport cast.\nGhetto\nJoshua Sobol's play/musical is a moving testament to the courage\nand resilience of Jewish groups\nunder threat of extermination from\nthe Nazis. To save as many lives in the Ghetto, they form a theatre. If\none has employment, he is deemed\nto be useful and therefore escapes\nexecution.\nThe harrowing set serves as a monument to oppression. The\nmusic and lyrics are edged with\npoignancy and sorrow. The emotional ending may be a sad one,\nbut the message is one of hope and\nbrotherhood.\nThis is a unique theatrical\nexperience I fully recommend it.\nThe Black Prince\nThe March on Russia\nBill Owen gives a touching\nperformance as a retired miner, in\nDavid Storey's play about life,\nfamily, old-age and responsibilities.\nIt delves into the individual's isolation and the workings of society\nseen through various members of a 'happy' family from the coal faces\nof the North to the affluence of the\nSouth; from feminism and independence to traditional\nvalues\u2014each one has a view to put\nacross, but a single-minded way of\nsaying it.\nThe performances are good but\nthe script often has nowhere to go,\nand we are left with our thoughts\ndrifting away from the stage.\nAlso recommended at the National\nare:\nHedda Gabler\u2014Juliet Stevenson\ngives a memorable, contemplative\nperformance in Ibsen's classic,\nreworked by Christoper Hampton\n(Les Liaison's Dangereuses)\nFuente Ovejuna\u2014The tiny\nCottleshoe stage comes to life with\na tale of oppression and civil unrest\nin a small Spanish village.\nAll productions run throughout the\nsummer.\nThe Black\nPrince\nALDWYCH THEATRE\nIris Murdoch's intellectual comedy\ntouches on such topics as the nature\nof art, literature, happiness and\nneurosis. The central character,\nBradley (Ian McDiarmid), is a middle aged writer who has never\nwritten anything because, he says,\nhe is a perfectionist. In the first half\nhe prides himself on his aloofness\nThe\nPlantagenets\nTHE BARBICAN (RSC)\nThis trilogy of Shakespearean\nhistories, chronicling the life of\nHenry VI, the rise of Edward IV and\nthe death of Richard III, continues\nits successful run at the Barbican.\nThe action comes thick and fast, the\nsets are brilliantly simplistic and the\nacting is top notch. There are\nremarkable performances from\nRalph Fiennes as Henry VI and\nPenny Downie as Queen Margaret,\nwith flashes of genius from Anton\nLesser as Richard III. Inspired\ndirection from Adrian Noble keeps\nit flowing smoothly. The limpid\nexposition and majestic spectacle\nmake this an experience to cherish.\nMacBeth\nTHE BARBICAN (RSC)\nAdrian Noble's sinister and evil\nproduction of 'the Scottish play'\nsingularly lacks innovation, but is\nstill a good example of a solid, surefooted staging of the play.\nMiles Anderson plays an unremarkable MacBeth, the only\none of Shakespeare's great tragic\nfigures to be utterly damned.\nThe emphasis in this production\nlies heavily on a greedy, ambitious\nMacBeth, but loses a lot of the tragic\nqualities by making him so utterly\ndisp i cable. To add some sort of\nlevity to the play, the scenes with\nthe three witches turn into semi-comic pieces, which I feel destroys\nthe mood.\nWhat dramatic impact there is, is\noffered by the dark and gloomy set,\nin which the walls move in, making\nMacBeth's world more claus troph ic. The ending, particularly, is\nimmensely powerful and impressively choreographed in its\nuse of special effects. But on the\nwhole it's an un moving experience.\nand incorruptibility by life. Then in\nthe second half he suddenly\nsuccumbs to a mad passion for his\nfriend's teenage daughter.\nIdeas and intellectual agitations\nthread their way through the\ncharacter's escapades. A farcical first\nhalf turns to murder, mayhem and\nmisery in the second. Throughout\nthe play McDiarmid's philosophical\nflamboyance rides out the bumps in\nthe story, making it a highly\nenjoyable, compelling performance.\nThe self-indulgent rant about\nHamlet is especially funny\nJune 21 1989 FELIX Page 39\n\n"

We hope Dave Smedley will\nprove as generous and considerate next year.\nWe have each been (separately) derided as\nisolated loonies without the backing of the people\nfor our cause. But we each express total approval\nfor all that either of us has said, so neither of us\nis a minority of one. (And as one of us is Dylan\nthat makes three of us.)\nYours,\nDylan James, Maths 1,\nSaradakis Emmanuel, Physics 1.\nNot a spastic\nDeor Bill,\nI would like to comment briefly as one of the\nimplied 'social spastics' at the Physics leaving\nparty mentioned in Dave Bums' article.\n1. I object to the derogatory use of the word\n'spastic'.\n2. There are plenty of 'sportsmen, social is ers and doers' at Imperial and many are Physics\nundergraduates.\nHappily I share Dave's view of a worthwhile\ntime at Imperial, having experienced both the\n'warts' and advantages of my decision to come\nto a non-campus London college with a reputation for hard courses. It happens that my\nstudying and chosen activities left me time for\nRCS Rag or spending evenings in the Union\nSnack Bar.\nFinally, thanks to Paul, Paul and Margaret for\nmaking the Physics party such a good evening.\nYours sincerely,\nAlice Jacques, Physics 3.\nNail in my foot\nDear Bill\nAnother Friday, another article in FELIX\nknocking Imperial College. As an MSc student\ncoming to London after a first degree at a provincial university I confess to finding the\nwhole debate somewhat painful. Perhaps the\nworst aspects are the assumptions made by some\nauthors about life at other universities. If Imperial\nis guilty of anything, it is of engendering severe\nattacks of 'grass-is-greener it is' in some of its\nundergraduate population. Perhaps a few myths\nneed to be destroyed.\nMyth 1) Imperial turns people off science and\nengineering, so they all run off and become\naccountants.\nYes, a high proportion of Imperial students do\nleave science. In fact, a large proportion of all\nscience graduates leave science. In Cambridge,\nover 50% of engineering graduates go into other\noccupations. This reflects more upon the status\nof such jobs in our society than where the student\nstudies, as a cursory glance at the letters page of\nmost institute journals would reveal. Realistically,\ncapable people will go where they get the best\ndeal. Blaming dull lecturers, by no means an IC monopoly, is tempting but inaccurate.\nMyth 2) You have to work harder for an Imperial\ndegree, and yet people don't think of it as\nspecial.\nMakes your heart bleed, doesn't it? I thought I worked hard for my first degree, but Imperial\nengineering courses do seem frightening. This is\nhardly a secret; in fact it is one of the reasons why\nImperial did not appear on my UCC A form.\nHowever, they are well regarded. My sponsors\nwere eager to get people to come here, and\nseveral recruitment agencies note the regard with\nwhich Imperial degrees are held. Don't expect an\neasy ride anywhere though. In my own course,\nstudents were supposed to read beyond set\ncoursework, and discuss such extra work in tutorials. Technical subjects always have a reputation for being difficult; people who want\nthree years of work, and a good degree at the end\nof it are in the wrong field, rather than at the\nwrong place.\nMyth 3) IC students are more\napathetic/immature/self-serving than elsewhere.\nOf course there are representatives of these\nsections at Imperial; there are anywhere you go.\nTrying to inspire students to chip in and help out\nis always a problem. Let me assure Dave Burns\nthat 'social spastics' are a feature of all\nuniversities, as well as life in general, and not\nconfined to Imperial College. Some would claim\nthe entrance requirements keep out the\nsportsmen, social is ers and doers. Sadly the\nentrance procedure at Imperial is little different\nfrom elsewhere, although the required ' A' level\ngrades may be higher. In my own case, after\ntaking an exam I was offered two E's, with no\ninterview. Was this an elitist attitude towards me?\nStudent politics seem to have occupied large\namounts of FELIX, yet little of the conversation\ni of students. This too is mirrored at other\nuniversities. Student politics is seen as largely\nunimportant by most students; I make no\ncomment on this, I only note that it is no different\nfrom any other university. The low turnout of\nvoters at every student election during my own first degree, as well as at the initial election of the\nLSE President provides suitable evidence.\nMyth 4) There are no women at Imperial.\nThere is obviously an imbalance. What strikes me\nmore are the somewhat selfish reasons put\nforward for change by the male population of\nCollege. At least Imperial avoids the all-male\nheartiness of the older Oxbridge colleges, where\nknocking nails through feet was seen as an\nacceptable punishment for losing a round of\n'University Challenge', and rugby or rowing\nwere (and possibly still are) the only routes to\nacceptance. Noticeable is the disproportionate\namount of input women give to Imperial; a look\nat the number holding office in clubs and societies\nshows that many do not feel intimidated by the\nsituation. The fact is that sciences are still seen\nas a male domain; as long as this situation exists,\nand Imperial remains a science college, there will\nbe more men than women. The women have my\nsympathy. The male undergraduates who expected university to resemble an enormous\nknocking-shop should have read the prospectus\nmore carefully.\nIn Conclusion, of course there are things wrong\nwith Imperial, and these should be changed, but\nto imagine that Imperial College is far worse than\nanywhere else is foolish. I enjoyed my first\ndegree, and am glad that I did not do it at\nImperial, but I am sure that if I had, I would be\nglad I had not done it anywhere else.\nYours,\nSJ Kukula, MSc Composite Materials.\nThe staff agree\nwith you\nentirely\nDear Bill,\nI had intended to write a vicious letter s lagging off the lack of humour in your prodigious organ\n.(Fnarr, \"Fnarr, etc), I was also going to fill it with\nnasty, bitchy comments like; 'Perhaps you should\ncall FELIX \"The Snoozepaper of Imperial College\nUnion\". But I won't. Why? The reason is that on careful examination\nof this year's FELICES I have been converted (but\nnot by Pat Baker) and seen the light: Bill, you are\nwithout a doubt the greatest humour is t and\nsatirist alive today!\nWhilst other, lesser publications like Punch and\nPrivate Eye insist on being so unoriginal as to print\nhumour on the humour pages and the boring\nstuff on the letters pages, you have shown your\ntrue genius, Bill, by being completely avant garde\nand printing tasteless drivel, such as 'Dear\nMarge', that would not raise even a giggle from\na Hyena, on you 'Humour' pages; and yet, you\npaint verbal sketches of ludicrous, sur really unreal characters with satirical genius on your\nletters page.\nYou started off the year with minor political\nsatire\u2014an hilarious spoof on the far left entitled\n'IC Class War Group and the PC Blakelock\nscandal', a theme you have recently returned to\nwith your side-splitting character, the absolute\nto s ser James 'I think LSE were right' Nathan. It\nwas at Christmas that you really moved into the\nbig boys' league; religious satire. With your\n'Bottle of Whisky and the Koran Farce' you\nproduced a biting satire on Islamic\nfundamentalism that left Rushdie's standing and\nmore than likely hastened the Ayatollah's recent\ndemise.\nRecently, you have shown your originality yet\nagain by combining political and religious satire\nto form right-wing 'Chistian' (I use the term\nloosely) Dylan James. His arguments that God really does give a damn about what colour of\nrosette you wear on your lapel made me laugh\nso much that I needed emergency treatment on\nmy ribs at St Mary's( remember the side-splitting\n'Mary's don't like UG Ms'?). However, Bill, I feel that you may have gone\ntoo far and could be accused of racism for your\ncharacter 'Emmanuel Saradakis'. By making a complete dick head like that Greek I fear that you\nmay have deeply insulted the entire Greek\nnation.\nYours in worshipful awe,\nRick Eiardiman, ME1.\nPage 2 FELIX June 21 1989\n\n"

I asked Upton- Park.\n'It takes many years of practice.\nThere are certain types of people.\nPeople who are not quite normal\nlike us: who do not respect the great\nBritish traditions, our customs, our\nway of life'. He started to hum the\nNational Anthem again. I interrupted him. 'People who do not stand for the\nNational Anthem,' he snapped. 'I think these people are parasites on society. That's the difference\nbetween us and that other group,\nthe so-called Guardian Angels. We\nstand for what's right!'\nA train arrived, Upton-Park\njumped on board and clattered\naway to his wife and 1.8 children in\nSurbiton.\nThis may be considered offensive\nIt was with great sadness that I learnt, last week, about the decision,\nby council, to change the nature of\nthe editorial control over the Rag\nMag. This will drastically change the\nway in which the Rag Mag is\nperceived by students and will, in\ndue course, affect the Imperial\nCollege Rag Mag's ability to sell\nitself, and Imperial College's notoriety amongst Britain's other\nstudents.\nThe changes were deemed necessary to avoid the bad publicity\nin the press, and future threats of\nlegal action as have been received\nthis year, and in previous years.\nHowever, no clean up action will be\neffective against the increasingly\nreactionary students movement.\nThe Rag Mag is, after all a publication which is circulated on\nbehalf of IC students, and as editor\nI would have expected anyone\nwithin College who found it\noffensive to be the first to react,\nsince a substantial number were\nsold here long before the rest of the\ncountry had a sniff. Indeed the\nentire incident is the result of a written complaint from one\nUniversity (Keele) and hence its\nArea NUS, and unsubstantiated\nrumour circulated in The Times HE S that we were to be prosecuted under\nthe Race Relations Act.\nThe changes themselves are; the\ninclusion of a' This may be\nconsidered offensive' warning on\nthe cover, a section printed on blue\npaper containing jokes which are\noffensive to a 'normal' person, and\nexpanding the censorship\ncommittee. The warning on the\ncover is not going to hurt the Rag\nMag too much, in fact it will increase\nsales by a significant amount, so I am not worried about this. It\nnevertheless shows the unqualified\nand misguided views which the\nsupporters of the doctrine hold. If\nthey seriously believe that this 'well\nwe did warn you' approach is going\nto stop people writing to\nnewspapers and the Union President, to complain, then they\nhave no idea how these types of\npeople react. They are people who\nwant to find Rag Mags, newspapers, television, etc\noffensive, they uphold the rights of\nindividuals to have freedom from\nso-called persecution, whilst they\ncrucify others for exercising freedom\nof speech.\nThese people will react in the\nsame way to the blue section, and\nalthough they will be warned not to\nread it if they are 'normal', who can\nresist forbidden fruit, and again they\nare not going to refrain from\ncomplaining. Anyway, what is a normal person?\nAll of this pales into insignificance\nif the third change works in the way\nit is intended to. The addition of the\nWomen's Officer, an Overseas'\nStudents Rep, a Religious Rep, and\na Homosexual Rep, I think is the\nfinal nail in the coffin for the IC Rag\nMag we all know and love. I do not\nsay this because I want a bigoted\nand ultra-offensive Rag Mag, far\nfrom it, I believe balance in hou m our is the important factor.\nVirtually every joke on Earth plays\non somebody's misfortune or their\nposition as a social minority of some\nsort, in fact, most of these jokes\noriginate from within these groups\nthemselves. Let's face it, the best\nYiddish jokes are told by Jews.\nNazis, Arabs and the National Front\nmerely go out and kill them.\nHumour always works as a way of\ndefusing social tension. I reluctantly\naccept that in principle a censorship\ncommittee is necessary, to\nsometimes provide an alternative\nperspective for the editor. By\nspecifically introducing 'minority'\ninterests onto a committee that\nshould be objective and representative of the populace, one\nreplaces balance with banality. It is\na fact that everyone gets a thrill by\nbeing shocked.\nI think it is important to appreciate\nthe type of people that will react to\npublication, naturally they are in\npositions of power in their Unions,\nbut are representing the feelings of\ntheir members? I have sold several\nhundred rag mags this year, in total\n4,500 have been distributed, we\nhave received two written complaints and two verbal\ncomplaints. Yet dozens of ordinary\nstudents country wide have\nenthusiastically bought IC Rag Mags\non the strength of previous issues\n(notably not last years). And people\nrushed after us to buy copies when\ntheir friends showed them what was\navailable. Comments received\nincluded: 'It had better be an\nimprovement on the shit our Union\nputs out.'\nI appreciate that it is the JC Rag\nMag, and that the IC Rag committee\nhave recommended the changes,\nand that the IC President has\nreceived complaints, but who has\nsold the past four or five editions of\nthe Rag Mag? It's the CC U's particularly R CSU Rag. If IC Rag\ndon't like the content let the CC U's be a front for the Rag Mag, and\noperate through IC Charity Rag.\nThe article written in The Times\nby the NUS Vice President even\nwent as far as to question the need\nfor rag mags, and by implication\nRag, as a fund-raising machine, and\nhoped for the fund-raising needs of\nthe world to be met by mega-events\nsuch as Comic Relief, and Live Aid. Mega events raise money for mega\ncharities, little events raise money\nfor little charities. Let everyone raise\nwhat they can, how ever they can.\nIt has been shown in the past that\nthere is a market for IC Rag Mags\nand their ilk (such as the Medical\nSchool editions), we have the largest\ngeographic sales, let us pander to\nthe market. IC should not knuckle\nunder to the bully boys 'levellers'\nwho dictate how we should think,\nwe are free spirits and should not\nplay lap-dog to the NUS and its\ncronies!\nDavid Williams, on behalf of the\nRCSU Carnival Committee.\nDave Williams battles against the Rag Chairman\nPage 30 FELIX June 21 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nW k \u00a3 zw'JJ\u00a3\ne# kts be /or\nImperial College\nWith the recent increased interest in\nEurope and the 'breaking down' of\nbarriers scheduled for 1992 FELIX\ninvestigated the impact 1992 will\nhave upon Imperial College. One of\nthe most relevant aspects of the\nunification of the European Community will be the freedom of\nmovement to work in any EC country. Therefore graduates who\nhave a knowledge of a nEC language will be at an advantage.\nPresently students at IC can study\nforeign languages in evening classes\nwith the Humanities Department\nand some courses include a foreign\nlanguage as part of the degree.\nApproximately500 students\nenrolled for language courses this\nyear and Mr Stables, Head of the\nHumanities Department, anticipates\nfurther increase es. This October\nstudents will be starting degree\ncourses which will contain a year in\nEurope (or at least a year in continental Europe) as College\nrealised that Britain is in Europe part of the mentality the whole\nnation will have to deal with. The\nHumanities Department is offering,\nas a result of these course, language\ncourses which contain a more\ntechnical and scientific vocabulary.\nBritish standards in engineering\nand science will need to be replaced\nwith European standards. This has\nalready started and Professor\nDowling of Imperial College is\nchairman of the European Committee agreeing uniform codes\nof practice with steel structures.\nStudents will feel the effects of these\nchanges directly.\nThe status and, more importantly,\nthe salary of engineers and scientists\nis generally higher in continental\nEurope. Many IC graduates may\nmanage to both stay in engineering\nand get a reward for doing so by\njoining the army of British workers\nin other EC countries encouraged by\nthe changes of 1992.\nThe greater implication of the\nEuropean Community has led to\nsome major potential merges\nbetween technological companies.\nFor instance there has been mention\nof a linking of Siemens GEC and\nPlessy. this will have some impact\non a college like Imperial which\ndeserves a substantial income from\nresearch contracts. The effect of 1992\nwill be to offer greater opportunity\nfor contacts from European firms.\nCurrently Brussels awards research\ngrants and the money directed\ntowards it for redistribution will\nincrease. Already Imperial is well\nplaced with about seventeen such\npre-competition research grants, out\nof a total of thirty in the UK. Environmental controls decided\nby the European Parliament will be\ntougher than the current British\nones. This will result in more money\nbeing available for environmental\nresearch, and Imperial has recently\nset up a centre for environmental\ntechnology.\nOne important feature of the\ndevelopment of undergraduate\ncourses is to include somewhere\nalong the line education about how\npeople in other EC countries think\nand behave. The Dean of City and\nGuilds, Professor Pat Holmes,\npointed out the example of a West\nGerman marketing director who said that he sells his products in English but buys stuff in German.\nProfessor Holmes went on to say\nthat the Board of Studies had spent\ntime discussing what sort of\nlanguage courses should be taught\nto include a cultural component.\nConcern was expressed that some\npeople might not take up the four\nyear courses with a year in continental Europe if student loans\nare introduced and the London\nfactor causes some worry.\nThus 1992 will effect Imperial\nCollege in some direct ways and\nemployment prospects will be\nimproved. Already some companies\nfrom other EC nations are joining in\nthe milk round. The numbers of\npeople taking a foreign language\ncomponent in their course is\nexpected to increase.\nFELIX\nHANDOVER\nwill be held on the 2nd quarter\nof the third passing of the\nFelicitix.

    "content": "Interview\nthere should be more freedom of\ninformation in this country. It's the\nmost secretive society in the\nWestern hemisphere. I don't think\nthe replacement of the official\nsecrets act is going to make it any\nbetter.\nYou obviously think Britain is too\nsecretive. Where do you think\nBritain is heading in terms of\npersonal privacy?\nPersonal privacy is always\nsomething you can buy, I feel. I hate\nthe idea of personalised junk mail\ncoming through my letterbox. Some\npeople deem their letter box to be\na private thing. I also get annoyed\nat people ringing me up trying to\nsell me things on the telephone.\nThese are very mild forms of\ninvasions of privacy, they're just\nannoyances. But there are more\nsinister forms of invasion of privacy,\nstemming right up to the trawling\nof files by agents of the state in order\nto protect this thing called national\nsecurity. I'm sure it goes on, in the\nBBC for example where people have\nbeen refused jobs on the grounds\nthat they have something in their\npast which was detrimental to the\ngovernment or to society at large. I think it's a very sinister\ndevelopment in society. It's very\ndifficult to define: what is privacy?\nAre there any subjects you wouldn't research into for political,\nmoral or religious reasons?\nI would say as a general rule no. In\nterms of specifics, I 've got absolutely\nno interest in a football manager's sex life or the private affairs of some\nperson. I just don't want to do that\nsort of story. I don't particularly\nwant to read about it either. Apart\nfrom that sort of area though there\nis nothing sacrosanct.\nDo you find that journalism intrudes on your private life?\nI think increasingly so. It's very\ndifficult to divorce your private life\nfrom your professional life because\nnews isn'ta nine to five job.\nSomething might happen at twelve\no 'clock at night and you're rung up\nand expected to find the story. It\nespecially happens working on a daily national, but I don't think it\nunduly affects my private life. I still\nenjoy my private life.\nWhen you're writing do you prefer\nworking on your own or collaborating with other people?\nI prefer writing on my own because\nyou can't write by committee. I have\nworked with other people and I don't find it that difficult providing\nyou have a professional agreement\nwith the other person. In terms of\nwriting, I always write on my own\nbecause I cannot write one\nparagraph then the other person\nwrites the next paragraph. You can\nwrite something and then the other\nperson can add to it and you can see\nwhat they've done, but it's twice as\nmuch work, not half as much.\nThat's why I prefer doing it on my\nown.\nHow long has it taken you to write\nand research your books?\nThe first book took a long time, I think it was about three years. The\nAIDS book took a very short time.\nIt took about three months. The\nreason for that was that Penguin\nwanted a book on AIDS, they\nwanted it quickly and we had the\ninformation to hand, more or less\nresearched already. For the second\nedition which has just come out, we\nwere given a bit more time. I think\nit's improved because of that.\nDid you concentrate just on writing\nthe book or did you do it in your\nspare time from your job?\nI had to do it in my spare time,\naround my job, which was very\ndifficult. I'm not sure whether I will\nundertake the task again, not in the\nfor see able future because it's very\ntime consuming and all your\nholidays and evenings and\nweekends are taken up. It's very\nexhausting as well.\nWould you want to work freelance,\nmaybe to give you the chance to\nwrite another book?\nNot at the moment, no. I 've never\nworked freelance for long periods of\ntime, just odd months here and\nthere. Maybe at some point in the\nfuture I will think about it, but for\nthe moment I have no plans. I prefer\nthe security of working full time for\nan organisation.\nOn the Record was obviously\nincredibly well researched. Do you\nthink it was rather off putting including that much technical detail\nin it?\nWith hindsight I do feel it was a very\nsolid piece of research. I sometimes\nwonder how easy it was to read and\nhow many people were that keen on\nwading through that amount of\nmaterial. For me it was a bit of an\nexperiment because it was my first\nlarge project. Because Duncan\nCampbell with whom I wrote it had\nalready done several books, he more\nor less took the lead in it. To a great\nextent it was his book rather than\nmine. I don't think I would do it the\nsame way again if I had the chance.\nI would want to make it a bit lighter\nand easier to read. I think it was a bit solid.\nWho have been your role models?\nI don't think I have any really. There\nare investigative journalists whom\nI admire, David Leigh on the\nObserver who's done incredibly\ngood stories. But there are a lot of\ngood reporters on Heet Street. Andy\nVeitch, for example, the Guardian\nmedical correspondent is very good.\nOften on New Scientist I would be\ncovering stories which he had\ncovered and he would leave very\nfew angles for me to do for a weekly\nmagazine. So he is a good reporter.\nI don't really have role models. I think role models are quite\ndangerous.\nWhat do you feel should be the\nimage of science that national\ndailies should present?\nTalking of role models, look at the\nNew York Times and Washington\nPost: they cover science exceedingly\nwell. They have no em barras ment whatsoever about putting an\nimportant but technically difficult\nstory on the front page.\nNewspapers in this country tend to\nshy away from science and\ntechnology. It's changing, but it's a constant battle to convince news\neditors that science is important\nbecause I think they feel, and maybe\nthe general public feels, that science\nisn't important, that it's too esoteric\nand not entertaining enough.\nDo you think the public's perception, as fuelled by\nnewspapers, is that scientists are all\nlittle men in white coats?\nThere is this element that either they\nare mad or they are evil. The 1950's science fiction approach to scientists\nis finally being buried. But if you\nmention a scientist to most people\ntheir eyes glaze over. It's an uphill\nstruggle. All we can do is keep\nwriting the stories and throwing\nthem at the news desk and hoping\nthat they get in.\nWhat do you think the public's perception of journalists is?\nProbably not very high: grubby men\nin grubby coats. Most people read\nthe tabloids and they have a lot to\nanswer for. But working on the\nTelegraph I can't really see many\ngrubby people around.\nA threat from within\n'On the Record' describes how the\nintroduction of the plastic National Insurance\nNumbercard could lead to its use as a national\nidentity card. It could then form the skeleton\nof a national registration system which could\nseverely curtail personal freedom. After\nexperiencing some problems over the security\nof providing Union cards, Imperial College\nUnion consulted the College on the pos sibi l ty of merging computerised library cards with\nUnion cards. This scheme has been shelved\nbecause of administrative difficulties.\nA global College-wide registration system\nsuch as this would have allowed the linking\nof information on courses, examination\nresults, personal tutors' reports, non-payment\nof hall and course fees and, perhaps most\ndisturbing of all, could have led to monitoring\nsocial activities and political affiliations\nthrough offering computerised mailing lists\nto clubs' members on providing members\nUnion Card numbers.\nPage 28 FELIX June 21 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Alternative\nWALTER WALTER WALTER At this time of year, a strange and\nnow familiar feeling always\npercolates softly through Walters\nhardened and drink\u2014sodden soul;\na feeling which can best be summed\nup by the phrase \"There we went\nagain\"\u2014to be spoken with a sigh,\nand in a resigned tone of voice.\nAnother year is in the last drawn out\nstages of grinding to a close, and\nmembers of staff are drawing the\nblinds and dusting off the bottles of\nSouth African sherry, in readiness\nfor the celebration of the departure\nof yet another mass of the great\nunwashed, waving their newly\nminted degrees, into the brave new\nworld of chartered accountancy.\nWalter would naturally be the last\nperson to heap scorn on anyone\nwhose chosen career involved\ndirtying their hands with the\npassage of large amounts of\nsomeone else s money, but\u2014largely\ndue to the stickiness of his own relations with accountants over the\nlast few decades\u2014he is inclined to\nview the financial professions with\na rather jaundiced eye. In other\nwords, may they rot in Hell. Slowly.\nJust to prove that this is the last\narticle this year, there now follow a few lines from a song by the\nimmortal Ralph Vaughn Williams:*\nLet other men make money faster,\nlabour ing in the dark run ed towns.\nI don't fear a peevish master,\nthough no man may heed my frown.\nI be free to go abroad, or take again\nmy homeward road,\nTo where for me the apple tree do\nlean down low, in Linden Lea.\nTo those of you who are surprised\nat someone as embittered as Walter\nquoting poetry, here's a bigger\nsurprise: Walter has joined the\ngreen revolution.\nIt's true! Not only has he taken to\nadding lead-free gin to his cocktails,\nbut he is at this moment wearing an\nadditive-free tie, and this article was\ntyped in its entirety on a recycled\nword-processor. Until recently he\nwas investigating the possibility of\nfitting a catalytic converter to his\ncigarette holder, but he feels that the\ncost, estimated at \u00a3600, is a little\nexcessive. See the above remarks\nabout accountants.\nAll this atmosphere awareness\nbusiness has led Walter to wonder\nwhether hot air\u2014of the human\nderived variety\u2014can be considered\na Greenhouse Gas. If so, apart from\nthe obvious contribution made by\npoliticians within College and without, it is clear that people such\nas Dylan James should stand up and\nbe counted, so to speak, for the\ndamage they are doing to the\natmosphere. Since last he appeared\nin these pages, Walter has actually\nmet Mr James, and was surprised to\nfind that he seemed harmless\nenough \u2014 hardly the frothing Ghengis Kahn type one was led to\nexpect. It only goes to prove, for the\nhundredth time, that you shouldn't believe all you read, even in this\nexalted journal.\nWho was it who said that happy\nmen don't write their memoirs? The\nname of this perceptive individual\nescapes Walter for the moment, but\nthe truism remains true all the same,\nand applies most of all to the\nvolumes of hind sighted wisdom\nbeing penned at this time of year by\nour esteemed sabbaticals: If the\nlength of the memoir is proportional\nto the degree of unhappiness, then\nNigel Baker (may his tribe increase)\nmust be a miserable man indeed,\nand who can blame him. Never\nmind, old son: Nearly over now.\nAnd finally\u2014for there must\nalways be an and finally\u2014Walter\nwould like to thank all those well-wishers who have enquired after\nhim during his recent illness.\nActually, illness is hardly the right\nword. What happened, not for the\nfirst time, is that he was obliged to\ngo into hiding to avoid those nice\nmen from the Inland Revenue. He would also like to thank the staff of\nHM Prison Wormwood Scrubs for\nallowing him to write these lines\nfrom the comfort of his modern,\nwell equipped cell, and for the\nassurance that he may get off with\nthree years if he keeps his nose\nclean. Roughly the equivalent of\nbeing sent an ced to three years at\nImperial College, don't you think?\nAll the best!\n\\^Ov0 A& OU'TIf\" WE ALL Ot. T pu.
