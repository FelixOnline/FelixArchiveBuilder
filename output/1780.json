    "content": "Does Wes Anderson\u2019s latest entry live up to the hype?\nThe French Dispatch, starring Bill Murray, Benicio\ndel Toro, Frances McDormand, Jeffrey Wright\nand many more stars, is one of the most highly\nanticipated films of the year. The story follows the\nesteemed editor-in-chief of a European publication,\nwhose death inspired his editors to publish the\nworks of his best writers as a memorial edition.\nI was fortunate enough to catch the film at the\nLondon Film Festival 2021. If you\u2019re like me, who did\nnot read up much about the film before the viewing,\nyou might be as pleasantly surprised by it as I am. The\nFrench Dispatch is unlike any of the other Anderson\nfilms I\u2019ve seen, yet it remains to be stylistically\nrecognisable. It takes on a much larger scale than his\nprevious works, as The French Dispatch consists of\nthree independent stories, strung together merely by\nthe publication the stories are from. If this classifies as\nan anthology film, I think it fails the same way as most\nanthologiesdo\u2013somestoriesareweakerthantheothers.\nThe first story follows an artist who created\npaintings from the prison where he is serving a life\nsentence. It has the absurd humour from Anderson\u2019s\npreviousworks, andinmyopinion,standsoutthemost\nbecause of Adrien Brody\u2019s deadpan performance. The\nsecond story touches on student-led revolutions. The\ntale is interesting but not exciting enough to keep the\nmomentum from the first story. Last but not least, the\nthird story brings the audience on an adventure to save\na kidnapped kid. Visually, this is the most appealing\npart. Animations are weaved into live-action in such a\ncreative and imaginative way that you wouldn\u2019t expect\nfrom a film, even if it is directed by Wes Anderson.\nThe French Dispatch is stunning to watch, but\nat the same time hard to follow. The dialogues are\nmeanderingly long, and jokes get lost while the\naudience is still processing the lines. If it is to mock\nhowwritersoftencomeupwithterriblylongsentences,\nI stand guilty for this. Long lines work well on paper\nbut not on screen. It is the least accessible Wes\nAnderson film so far, making The French Dispatch a\nletdown for someone who generally likes his crafts.\nThe French Dispatch\nNew Film Release\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n22\nYasmine Chan Film Writer\nDune\nNew Film Release\nZanna Buckland Books Editor\nAword to the wise: if you\u2019re not a patient person,\nthis film probably isn\u2019t for you... That being\nsaid, the third remake of \u2018Dune\u2019, originally written\nby Frank Herbert, is thoroughly immersive. Despite\nnot having seen either of the first two versions, Denis\nVilleneuve\u2019s iteration is acclaimed by fans to be the\nmost true-to-the-novel \u2018Dune\u2019 yet. Ignoring the\nstar-studded cast for a moment, the vast, expansive\nscenes created by cinematographer Greig Fraser and\nhis team highlight the real stars of the show: Star\nWars-esque forts and spaceships that tower over\neverything. Dragonfly-inspired hovercrafts portray a\nrefreshing take on the evolution of human aviation.\nThroughoutthefeature,mesmerisingshroudsofmist\nandsandreflecttheintriguesurroundingtheplotwhile\nsimultaneously hiding the formidable, full-toothed\nsandworms that inhabit the dunes, albeit rendering\nsome scenes a little visually dull. This is by no means a\nfast-paced film, and intermittent flash-forwards make\nit a slightly trippy experience, but keep in mind that\naudiences should be expecting a sequel by late-2023.\nAction-packed scenes do come around, and slower\nsections provide time to process the occasionally\nconfusing storylines. It may even be pertinent\nto save deciphering the plot until afterwards.\nDespite the mountain of expectations that\nfollow them as the third manifestation of their\nrespective characters, the list of featured A-listersTimothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Fergusson,\nOscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa - give\nmostly stellar performances. Although fitting for\nthe relatively serious tone of the film, the intense\norchestral soundtrack running throughout the\nfeature can be at times overbearing and ostentatious.\nIn conclusion, coming back to the idea of\npatience; if you\u2019re looking to see a full-on action\nfilm, I would recommend \u2018No Time To Die\u2019, or\n\u2018Venom: Let There Be Carnage\u2019 instead. But if\nyou\u2019re in the market for a moving, breathing piece\nof cinematic art, get yourself a ticket and take a seat.\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n10\nAn interview with Dr Fredi Otto\nS: You were co-director of the\nECI (Environmental Change Institute) at Oxford and held an associate professorship there. Why\ndid you decide to come to Imperial?Willyoubuildacommunity\naroundweatherattributionhere?\nF: So, I think the last question is really\neasy to answer; I hope so very much. [...].\nBut at the moment I am still trying to\nfigure out how Imperial works and what\nI am doing. And WWA is also coming\nwith me so that will be based at Imperial. Why did I come to Imperial? Well,\nI think that the Grantham Institute is a\nreally great institute that has a large emphasis on impact and also has support\nfor that. They have a comms team, they\nhave a policy engagement team, they\nhave all the connections to Westminster and local decision-making which I\nthink is really important and interesting\nand an important part of my work. [...] I\nthink the Grantham Institute, they have\nfantastic people working on mitigation\nbut they don\u2019t have that much on the ad-aptationandlossanddamagesideandso\nI am also a good fit for them and it\u2019s not\njust that they are good for me.\nS: What are some of the questions in extreme event attribution you want to answer while\nyou\u2019re at Imperial?\nF: I think we have made huge progress\nin the last years on the physical science,\nweather side. That is, how we conduct\nthese attribution studies and which\nmethods to use, how to use the models,\nhow to quantify uncertainty and so on.\nBut I think where there\u2019s a huge area of\nresearch that still needs to be done is on\nthe link between the social or the real\nworld. What about a weather event is actually causing the damages? [...] Mostly,\nwhen we do climate science research, we\nlook at things that are easy to get out of\nthe climate model, so the hottest day of\nthe year, 90% rainfall intensity, and so\non. But what actually leads to damages\nis often a combination of different meteorological variables \u2013 and of course\nexposure and vulnerability. And so, understanding what it is about the weather\nthat we are vulnerable to and also understanding the role of vulnerabilities and\nexposure in turning a weather event into\na catastrophe is where there is still quite\na big research gap [...].\nS: Interesting. Extreme\nevent attribution has\nbecome extraordinarily popular with the\nmedia. Was that your\nwish initially and are\nyou happy with how\nthe media mostly portrays attribution?\nF: We founded WWA, the\ninitiative where we do these\nstudies rapidly on the timescale that feeds into the public\ndiscussion of these extreme\neventswhileorshortlyafterthey\nhave happened. So yes, it was\nthe intention to be part of that\ndiscussion. Before we did WWA,\npeople did ask about the role of climate change when an extreme event\nhappened, but scientists usually kept\nquiet and didn\u2019t say much, so the question was answered by people with only\na political agenda. We wanted to change\nthat to bring scientific evidence into that\ndebate so that we get a more realistic understanding of what climate change actually means. Given that that was our in-tention, I\u2019m very happy that it has been\nso successful and so many people, across\nthe science community, are working\nwith us and are working on these studies and that the media are picking it up.\nI would say I\u2019m mostly happy with how\nthe media reports it, apart from the fact\nthat there is too much focus on the num-bers. Phrases like, \u201cIt\u2019s become X times\nmore likely\u201d, have come to dominate\ncoverage. The context of exposure and\nvulnerability which we always give in\nthese studies doesn\u2019t often make it into\nthe media reporting. And I think that\u2019s\ndefinitely not just the fault of the media,\nbut also that we haven\u2019t quite found the\nright way of communicating that [the\ncontext of exposure and vulnerability]\nin our press briefings. [...] It\u2019s a really fine\nline between highlighting that we are in\nthe era of loss and damage, that climate\nchange is happening and already causing losses - but that, on the other hand,\nthere\u2019s a huge amount that you can do\nlocally to be better prepared for extreme\nevents and adapt to them and often a\nlarge driver is not the weather event it-self. If it is, then climate change is only\na small driver amongst many others. [...]\nS:Butthentofocusonlossand\ndamage, do we really need attribution science at all?\nF: I don\u2019t think we need attribution\nto deal with loss and damage in an individual context to help people who have\nlost. I do think in a global picture we\nneed attribution to realise how big the\ndamages actually are, so that we know\nhow much finance we need to mobi-liseinordertodealwithlossanddam-age. I think for that, larger scale picture attribution is important but not\non a local scale.\nS: Interesting.\nContinues on page 10...\nShirin Ermis Science Writer\nAt the end of a very eventful decade at the University of Oxford, Dr Otto is joining the Grantham Institute\nat Imperial this year. Science writer Shirin Ermis spoke to her to discuss her research, and what she wants to\nfocus on next.\nderstanding what it is about the weather\nthat we are vulnerable to and also understanding the role of vulnerabilities and\nexposure in turning a weather event into\na catastrophe is where there is still quite\na big research gap [...].\nS: Interesting.

Some\npeople just didn\u2019t like the survey,\nsome assumed I was a\nMarxist (somewhat\nmissing the mark),\nbut more commonly\npeople criticised the\nsurvey for being too\nsweeping to let those\nanswering it properly\nexpress their opinions.\nI would like to be clear:\nthis survey was not produced for you\nto accurately express your political\nviews. We ask intentionally broad and\nbinaryquestionstogleanclearanswers\nthat we can display in somewhat\ninteresting infographics and compare\ntoour2019versionofthesamesurvey.\nI believe that political polarisation\nis one of the most counter-productive\nphenomenons in the Western world\ntoday. People sort themselves into as\nmany different tribes as suits them\nand each position becomes sorted\ninto the political left or right (or\nLabour vs Tory in the UK). I\u2019m just\nthankful that we\u2019re not as partitioned\nin the UK as those in the US are.\nStudies have looked into\nbehavioural changes within a group\nof humans when they are divided into\narbitrary teams and given various\noptions of reward at the same time as\nbeing told what the other teams will\nreceive. For example, team A gets to\ndecidewhethertheyget\u00a3100andteam\nB gets \u00a380, or they get \u00a390 and team B\ngets \u00a350. The teams are not in contest\nwitheachother,thereisnowinningor\nlosing team, and the money will make\nno difference to the rest of\nthe proceedings, yet more\noften than not the group\nin charge chose to get less\nmoney if the other group\nwas detrimentally affected\nmore than they were.\nThis competitiveness\nand tribalism seems to\nbe a fundamental part\nof human nature, yet we can all\nsee that it\u2019s getting worse. There is\nabsolutely no need for mask wearing\nto be a left vs right issue, yet large\nswathes of US Republicans (and the\nConservative MPs in the House of\nCommons) refuse to wear them. If\nyou go back 70 years or so there is no\nclear ideological difference between\nthe Democrats and Republicans, and\nit was even the Democrat Dixiecrats\nin the south who tried to uphold\nracial segregation laws. No there is\nnot a single Democrat less liberal\nthan the most liberal Republican.\nSwinging back to the original\npoint, the Felix Political Leaning\nsurvey does not have the same affect\nas current social discourse. \u201cif you\nhad to pick one\u201d is not the same as\n\u201cyou have to pick one\u201d.

    "content": "FRIDAY 22ND OCTOBER 2021\nSCIENCE\n11\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nContinued from page 10...\nF: It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t put the\nmessage out, \u201cOh this is climate change\nso it\u2019s the responsibility of the global north, there\u2019s nothing you can do\u201d. I\nthink that\u2019s not true and it\u2019s never the\nonly thing that leads to losses and dam-ages.\nS: That\u2019s an interesting po-sition. So you\u2019re emphasising\nthat we have to adapt to climate\nchange as well and make communities more resilient to extreme\nevents.\nF: Not only that we have to but also\nthat we can. I think it\u2019s important to give\nagency to not make everyone feel completely disempowered.\nS: So then, do you do extreme\nevent attribution mainly for the\nmedia or do you do it for adaptation planning as well?\nF: For mitigation we have an inventory of emissions for every country, we\nhave metrics for how we measure our\nemissions. For adaptation, we don\u2019t have\nthat. We have no inventory of losses and\ndamages; we don\u2019t know what the impacts of climate change globally are. We\nhave no great method on how we measure them, so there\u2019s no metric quantifying what good adaptation actually is.\nAnd a lot of that is not something that\nyou can necessarily quantify with natural science. I think it is important to get\na more comprehensive overview of what\nthe impacts of climate change actually\nare, and from that side, attribution is\nactually helpful. [\u2026]I think in the small\nscale, you understand your vulnerabilities when an extreme event actually hap-pens. Doing an attribution study, looking at which aspect of the weather has\nactually led to this, is also useful locally\nbecause you can then know where you\nneed focus in the projections. We need\nto take that into account in our local adaptation planning.\nS: Very nice. Finally, what are\nthe big challenges for attribution science in the years to come?\nWhich problems do you set out\nto solve?\nF: Well, I think a big problem with\nclimate science in general, but with attribution in particular, is the huge bias\ntowards the Global North. We have far\nfewer studies in the Global South, we\nalso just have less data. And when there\nis data, there are studies that one could\ndo, but they are not done. I think understanding what climate change means on\nlocal scales on which we make decisions,\nand in the Global South, is something\nI would be really keen to help [with].\nOf course, I know it\u2019s important that\nthese studies are driven by people from\nthese regions but to do that, we, as the\nGlobal North, have a big responsibility\nto help with funding. And we already\ntalked about vulnerability and exposure\n- and what events actually cause damag-es. What are we actually vulnerable to?\nThere are more technical things as well.\nIn WWA we have a protocol of things\nthat we always have to do and have to do\nin a similar way so things are transpar-ent, and everyone can reproduce what\nwe do. We have some statistical ways\nof evaluating the climate models and\nthen deciding whether to use them or\nnot. But I think there\u2019s a lot of room for\nimprovement in how to identify which\nprocesses your model needs to be able to\nreproduce in a meaningful way, so that\nyou can actually use it. I think there\u2019s a\nlot of work left.\nThe author and Felix thank\nDr Otto for the time she took to\nexplain the future challenges in\nattribution science and its role\nin society. We are excited about\nDr Otto\u2019s work and welcome her\nwarmly to Imperial.\nFirefighters pumping water out of a tunnel in Liege, Belgium.

    "content": "Wow your friends with your superior crossword skills!\nCryptic crosswords almost always seem daunting\nand inaccessible to those attempting to start\nsolving them. Speaking from my own experience, my\nview of the puzzle used to be one of exclusivity, with\nseemingly endless rules to learn in order to crack the\ncryptic. I know that many of those unfamiliar with\nthem simply discard the task as impossible. However,\nwith a little practice and understanding of how the\nclues work, a cryptic crossword can be not only acces-sible, but deliciously satisfying to solve.\nThe grid\nAs with any crossword, the puzzle consists of a grid\nof squares, white and black, with the white squares\nbeing filled in by you, dear cruciverbalist.\nThe clues\nOf course, the clues of a cryptic crossword are what\nmakes it cryptic. The key to it is that, when you know\nthe rules of the cryptic, the answers to the clues should\ncertainly feel justified (if a little evil sometimes). There\nare four main types:\n1.Instructional\nMost clues will, in one way or another, tell you\nexactly how to \u201cbuild\u201d the word. We\u2019ll later discuss\nhow to identify different instructions, but for now let\u2019s\nlook at an example. The answer to \u2018Went around the\npond-life. [4]\u2019 is NEWT. The clue is an instruction to\ntake the word WENT, move it AROUND, to obtain\na word for POND-LIFE. Note that the clue contains\nthe definition of the answer (newt = \u2018pond-life\u2019) and\nthe rest of the clue is the instruction. Almost all cryptic clues will follow this structure, containing both the\ndefinition and instructions.\n2.Double definition\nThese clues are short phrases, with two words\nmeaning the same thing. An example from last week\u2019s\ncrossword is \u2018Lower basin. [4]\u2019. The answer is SINK:\nboth words mean SINK, but in different ways.\n3.Puns\nPun clues are just what they sound like \u2013 puns. An\nexample from last week is \u2018Scowl when you draw a\nterrible card. [7]\u2019. This one is GRIMACE, with scowl\nbeing the definition, and GRIM ACE being a pun for\n\u2018terrible card\u2019. Note that punctuation, such as the space\nhere, is ignored in the construction of words. Simply\nput, only write letters in the boxes! A crueller clue of\nthis type last week was \u2018Fat-free fish? [5]\u2019, with the answer SPRAT. The solver needs to know that a SPRAT\nis a fish and also the character in the rhyme beginning\n\u201cJack SPRAT could eat no fat\u2026\u201d. The pun here is a lot\nlooser than for the previous example, but still appreciable (I hope!).\n4.Implied definition\nPerhaps the trickiest of all cryptic clues are those\nin which the definition is implicit. Last week, we had\n\u2018How one could describe the acne-ridden clown? [4]\u2019,\nfor which the answer was PIED. Unlike the other\nclues we have mentioned, the definition isn\u2019t really in\nthis clue explicitly; rather, the clue is asking for a word\nthat could describe a clown, but also someone who\nis acne-ridden. We have a hybrid clue, using double\ndefinition (PIED as in blotchy and PIED as in having\nhad pies thrown at one\u2019s face) but in a covert way.\nIndicators\nYou\u2019d have my sympathy for saying that this all\nseems impossibly convoluted. However, there are\nmany indicators of the various things clues will be\ninstructing:\n1. Anagrams\nEvery cryptic has anagrams. There are countless\nhints that the letters in a clue are an anagram, normally associated with movement (e.g. \u2018around\u2019, \u2018about\u2019,\n\u2018running\u2019), with madness (e.g. \u2018wild\u2019, \u2018crazy\u2019, \u2018party\u2019), or\nwith potential (\u2018can be\u2019, \u2018made into\u2019, \u2018possibly\u2019).\nLast week we had the clue\nfor PERSIA being \u2018As ripe as a\nland can be. [6]\u2019 \u2013 the indicator\nbeing \u2018can be\u2019, and the definition\nbeing \u2018land\u2019. Therefore, we get\nthe name of a land which is an\nanagram of \u2018as ripe\u2019.\n2. Abbreviations\nCrossword abbreviations appear throughout the clues. Single\nletters or short abbreviations\nthat appear in the word will be\nsignified in the clue. For exam-ple, \u2018left\u2019 in the clue will often\nsignify the letter \u2018L\u2019 in the word. There are hundreds\nof possibilities for these, but a rule of thumb is that\nthe abbreviation will either be a very well-known one\n(such as MP for representative), or one you would see\nin real life (P for parking is seen on signs, so is a valid\nabbreviation). There is a Wikipedia list of these abbreviations which I strongly recommend bookmarking.\n3. Locators\nOften the position of parts of a word in relation\nto others will inform you of the whole word. Words\nlike \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018inside\u2019 indicate one word inside another,\nwhereas \u2018by\u2019 and \u2018next to\u2019 indicate words side-by-side.\n\u2018Down\u2019 clues sometimes include the words \u2018on\u2019 or\n\u2018below\u2019 to indicate stacking. An example is last week\u2019s\nclue for THRONG: \u2018Cram right into the undergar-ment. [6]\u2019. The definition is \u2018cram\u2019, with the abbreviation for \u2018right\u2019 being inserted into the word \u2018thong\u2019.\n4. Reversal\nThe word \u2018back\u2019 or \u2018up\u2019 can signify reversing the letters of a word. For instance, \u2018Put the gas back, it needs\nreinflation! [3]\u2019 is the clue for SAG.\n5. Sounds-like\nThe words \u2018We hear\u2019 or anything to do with speak-ing/hearing can indicate homophones.

    "content": "FRIDAY 22ND OCTOBER 2021\n9\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nIf you too have started many conversations this past summer with a comment on the crazy weather, you are in\ngood company, dear friend, and you\nlikely had a lot to talk about. Floods in\nGermany and China, heatwaves in the\nPacific Northwest and Canada, and\ntropical cyclones in Bangladesh. The\nmedia has brought us a constant stream\nof news about extreme weather events\nthis year. It almost seems unnatural now\nnot to talk about the weather as a manifestation of the climate and immediately go over to a heated discussion about\nmitigation of further climate change.\nBut this thinking is relatively new.\nFor decades, weather and climate were\nseen as two very separate things. While\nweather is what we witness in\nour everyday lives, climate is\nthe average of weather over\nmany years - often the time\nframe scientists discuss is 30\nyears. Trying to learn about\nthe climate by observing the\nweather on just one day was\nfrowned upon. As a conse-quence, scientists working on\nextreme weather events such\nas heatwaves, flooding or tropical cyclones usually kept a\nvery low profile in the media.\nClimate physicist Dr Fredi Otto noticed this but she\nalso could not help but realise that while scientists kept\nquiet, those with political\nagendas did not shy away\nfrom commenting on extreme events whenever they\nhappened. Her ambition was\nto bring the scientific discussion on extreme weather\nevents into the public. Her\nascent into the TIME 100\nMost Influential People list\n1 Prof van Oldenborgh sadly passed away last week. We offer condolences to his family and friends and all who knew him. His work has greatly influenced attribution\nscience and although we are focussing on Dr Otto this week, we acknowledge his immense contribution.\nalong with her collaborator Geert Jan\nvan Oldenborgh1\nspeaks of their success.\nThe two researchers founded the\ninitiative \u2018World Weather Attribution\u2019 (WWA) which is specialised in\ncreating studies that analyse how climate change changes the likelihood\nof extreme events. WWA produces\nthese studies in almost real-time, often while the event is still ongoing or\nonly a couple of days after the event.\nNaturally, while we are all still processing what happened, we are much more\nlikely to pay attention to their analysis.\nThe methodology of the group makes\nuse of incredibly detailed climate sim-ulations. Typically, they would compare simulations of possible weather\nin a climate that includes greenhouse\ngases by humans and simulations without these emissions. The researchers\nwould first decide on an aspect of the\nextreme event, like 3-day average temperatures or rainfall intensity in a specified region of the model and compare\nthe statistics in the two simulations.\nThis process of event definition, that includes decisions on which weather variables to use, what time frame to look\nat, and what areas to look at, actually\nis crucial for the result of an attribution study. It is also where most of the\nuncertainties of these studies originate.\nLet\u2019slookatthatinmoredetailforthe\nrecent flooding in Germany and Western Europe from July. The group decided to analyse the statistics of rainfall in\nthe two simulated scenarios; one with\nand one without anthropogenic climate\nchange. The observed extreme event\nwas defined as the maximum one-day\nrainfall in a wider area of Western Europe. This wider area had to be chosen\nbecause the flooding in just the smaller\narea that it occurred in this year was so\nunprecedented that the sample size of\nsimilar rainfall events in the models was\ntoo small to produce reliable statistics.\nLooking at the probability distributions\nof rainfall events in the two simulations\nand comparing them to the strength of\nthe observed event (see figure), the researchers then classified how likely the\nobserved event was in each scenario.\nThrough this analysis they were able\nto express whether or not the observed\nevent had been made more (or less!)\nlikely through climate change. The result for the large area that they chose\nwas, that it had been made 1.2 to 9 times\nmore likely by climate change.\nAttribution science can\nalso help policymakers and\nlocal populations understand\nwhich type of extreme events\nare becoming more likely with\nclimate change. This can be\ndone by giving return periods\nfor certain types of weather\nevents. The floods in Germany\nfor example are believed to be\na 500-year event. Nonetheless,\nin a recent article published\nin the Financial Times, the\nchair for least developed nations at the UN climate negotiations in 2015, Giza Gaspar\nMartins, voiced doubts. He\nflagged attribution science as\na privileged scientific pursuit,\ntaking emphasis away from\ndesperately necessary adaptation and mitigation efforts in\nthe global south. Dr Otto will\nexplain in the interview overleaf how she still sees attribution science as an integral\npart of the adaptation effort.\nShiris Ermis Science Writer\nIllustration of the general idea of attribution science. Rainfall amount is on the x-axis, the frequency of the corresponding events\nis on the y-axis. The distribution of rainfall events depending on their strength can be obtained from the climate model simula-tions. The observed event appears in the real-world distribution in a higher frequency than in the world without anthropogenic\nclimate change.\nScience writer Shirin Ermis discusses the link between weather and climate, speaking to climate physicist Dr Fredi Otto, Senior\nLecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute (pages 10-11)\nCrazy weather and the future of attribution science\nSCIENCE Edited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nFrequency\nNo climate change\nReal world\nObserved event\nRainfall\n\n"

    "content": "In 25 years, Britain has changed a lot, but Ayub Khan\nDin\u2019s look into the home of an immigrant family living in the north of England in the 1970s shows that\nmuch is still the same. The show stars a new generation\nof young and diverse actors playing six English-Pakistani teenagers \u2014 a few of whom also starred in Ackley\nBridge, another of Khan Din\u2019s creations. Whilst they\nembody characters set years before they were born, the\njoy and the pain they portray still feels very fresh.\nGeorge (Tony Jayawardena) came to England almost 40 years ago, married his white English wife Ella\n(Sophie Stanton) and, seven children later, is still trying to keep a firm grip on his teenagers\u2019 lives. George\nis funny, almost a caricature with his strong Pakistani\naccent, but also stubborn and, as we find out later,\ncan get very, very angry. The chemistry between their\nchildren, especially the four middle children, Maneer\n(Joeravar Sangha), Tariq (Gurjeet Singh), Saleem\n(Adonis Jenieco), and Meenah (Amy-Leigh Hickman)\nshines through clearly. After only a few interactions\nwe already feel as though we know these characters as\nfully-formed individuals \u2014 it is easy to recognise ourselves and our family members in their natural portray-als. The oldest brother, Abdul (Assad Zaman), brings a\ndistant energy as he experiences the pressure of making\nup for his disgraced older brother. The youngest, Sajit\n(Noah Manzoor) seems to have obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder; Manzoor plays the role with many little ticks\nandwegetthesensethatSajittrieshisbesttoshuthim-self away from the trauma of his dysfunctional family.\nAllthesiblingsstrugglewiththeiridentity.Religion,\nculture, and family are all interwoven and hold different meanings to each of them. The heartfelt dialogue\nbetween different members of the cast shows the nuance of the second-generation immigrant experience:\nstuck between the cultures of their ancestors, the traditions with which they were raised, and the land they\nwere born in. The play is backdropped by the outbreak\nof war and violence East Pakistan (modern day Bangladesh). This intensifies in the second half, mirroring\nthe drama in the characters\u2019 lives as arranged marriages\nare cunningly forced upon the eldest two brothers. The\nsituation seems impossible for the siblings to navigate,\nthat is until Saleem sits down and calmly explains to\nhis stubborn Pakistani father that his older brothers\ndon\u2019t want to get married, and this is not their time.\nThe audience erupted into laughter, a rather sinister\ninside joke that embodies the shared identity of many\nimmigrants.\nAlthough immigrant families have many challenges\nto navigate, the love and comedy is also a staple, and\nthis shines through the production. One especially\nmemorable scene sees Meenah and Maneer lip-syncing\nto a Bollywood classic \u2014 this begs the question, why\nare there not more Bollywood musicals being staged\non the West End, they would be a blast! Maybe Khan\nDin\u2019s next work should explore a more musical medi-um. I would love to see immigrant experiences from\nthe female perspective as, in this play, Meenah, the only\ndaughter, felt under-explored.\nFor something that feels fresh yet warm and familiar,\nwith lots of laughs and an extremely talented cast, East\nis East is definitely one to catch while you can.\nEast is East: Not just another dysfunctional immigrant\nfamily\nReviewed by Eamon Akil Farhat Arts Writer\nEast is East\nWhere?

    "content": "Honestly, I couldn\u2019t think of a time\nthat\u2019s more exciting than now to\nenter the space of cryptocurrency.\nYes, I know, that sounds fairly cliche, and you hear\nthat all the time from YouTube advertisements, but\nI\u2019m saying this from the bottom of my heart\u2026 there\nis no better time than now to enter the market of\ncryptocurrencies.\nWhy? Well, it\u2019s not because we just had a historical\nbull run in April that added 60,000 millionaires to the\nplanet, nor because bitcoin increased by more than\n7 millions times (yes, that\u2019s right, you could convert\nthat to 700 million percent, if you like) in price since\nit was first launched back in 2009, but because of the\nevery cool thing that is currently happening within the\nspace.\nBefore we look at some specific applications of\ncryptocurrency, it is essential to understand that most\ncryptocurrencies run on what\u2019s called a \u201cdecentralised\nnetwork\u201d, which means that there are no centralised\nauthorities that could obtain the exclusive rights to\nalter data stored on this network. This is crucial, and\nyou will see why soon.\nTaking the most well-known case of cryptocurrency,\nBitcoin, to act as an example, we could see how\nsome cryptocurrencies could be used in cross-border\ntransactions (basically, two people that live in two\ndifferent countries). Somebody could argue that\nBitcoin\u2019s value is so unstable that it is not suitable for\nbeing used as a currency. 0.001 Bitcoin might today\nbe able to pay off your weekly groceries, but tomorrow\nmight not even buy you a pot noodle! That is true\nin a sense, hence why \u2018stable coins\u2019 such as USDT\nand USDC are invented, whose values are linked to\nthe values of USD \u2013 the US Dollar, which makes\ntheir value relatively unchanged most of the time,\nunless USD experiences a big fluctuation in price.\nThis is also done in a much cheaper manner than say,\nTransferWise, or Revolut, because there is no middle\ncompany that\u2019s taking the cut from international\ntransactions. Instead, every computer (or \u2018node\u2019)\non the blockchain that supported the transaction\nwould obtain a fee from the transactional costs. But,\nsince blockchains can\u2019t do M&A deals, once a better\nblockchain with cheaper transaction fees come out, it\nwouldn\u2019t be bought by Apple or Facebook, but rather,\nit would get customers as people would simply prefer\nto use it more due to the lower fees.\nYou see? Decentralisation allows for better market\ncompetitions, as bigger blockchains don\u2019t necessarily\nhave that advantage if they don\u2019t regularly update\ntheir technologies and they also can\u2019t just overtake the\nsmaller blockchains by throwing billions of dollars\nat their face. This is why smaller blockchains such\nas Solana and Avax are gaining traction recently, as\nthey are cheaper to use, and also faster in terms of the\ntransactional speeds.\nFurthermore, I\u2019m pretty sure all of us have had\nthose weird experiences, where we are just having a\nchat with friends on some random topic that we have\nnever searched up on Google before. However, a few\nminutes after your conversation ends, your Instagram\nads start to display relevant contents of what you\nhave just discussed with your friends. That sounds\nkind of creepy, doesn\u2019t it? The truth is, the software\nyou use wants to collect your data and then sell it to a\nbig tech company (like say, for example\u2026 Facebook),\nwhich could utilise this data to provide more tailored\nadvertisements towards you. Of course, they could also\nuse this data to train their A.I., or, simply store them,\nfor many other purposes.\nThat is quite common nowadays, with tech\nconglomerates dominating the data world. However,\nmany geeks (including myself) hate that. So, many\nsmart engineers came up with the solution to store the\ndata not in any single company\u2019s storage place, but on\neverybody\u2019s computer. What\u2019s more important is that\nalthough this data is stored on these computers, they\nare not accessible to the owner of these computers,\nunless they have what\u2019s called the \u201csecret key\u201d to these\ndata. The exact mechanisms of how this work goes\ninto too much detail, but if anyone is still reading until\nnow, I strongly recommend you to search for how\nblockchain technologies work, and how WEB 3.0\nworks.\nThat being said, this is exactly what some\ncryptocurrencies are currently trying to do. Take for\nexample, GRT \u2013 the graph network. It\u2019s a new way of\ntransmitting data (known as a \u2018protocol\u2019) that utilises\nWEB 3.0 technology. It behaves like Google, but\ninstead of your search history being collected by any\ncompany such as Google itself, it is being collected\nby every computer that participates in the blockchain\nthat is lying below the application interface of GRT. It\nis decentralised. If someone wants to spy on this data,\nthey will have to break into the blockchain, which is\nvirtually impossible. The GRT is essential to every part\nof the economy on this search engine, hence why GRT\nis valued so highly.\nThere are many other applications, such as\ndecentralised data storage, decentralised video\nstreaming, decentralised commercial banking, so on\nand so forth. You do see a pattern here though. These\nmonopolised industries are usually the first to be\nchallenged by cryptocurrencies. It is essentially a social\nrevolution where authorities are being challenged. This\nis geeky, but this is the future of tech, unless you enjoy\na tech world where only FAANG exists and all other\nstart-ups are just there to be acquired by them.\nPeople say the asset class is purely speculative,\nbut the same was said about junk bonds 30 years\nago and they are now an essential part of any fund\nmanager\u2019s portfolio. Would the same happen to\ncryptocurrencies? Only time would tell, but one thing\nfor sure is\u2026 if the cryptocurrency space does keep\ngrowing and eventually mature into a market similar to\nthose of bonds or equities, then the early participants\nwould surely not regret their decisions.\nThere\u2019s only one way that Crypto\u2019s going \u2013 up.\nBitcoin... Dogecoin... ooh!\nWell, we think cryptocurrency is the future. For that reason, we\u2019ve dedicated 10% of our capital fund, QT Capital to research the various cryptocurrencies\navailable and monitor their movements as time passes.

The biggest fire is the Kincade\nFire in the North of California. As of\nnow, the fire is only 15% contained and\nhas burned at least 74 000 acres, leaving\nmore than a million citizens without\nelectricity or service.\nNearly 200 000 people have been ordered to leave their homes, while an astonishing 4000 firefighters are battling\nthe flames. Fire department representative Jonathan Cox says it could take\n\u201cweeks, if not months\u201d to extinguish the\nfires fully.\nIt is becoming more and more evident\nthat the frequency and intensity of these\nfires are highly linked to climate change,\nmore specifically they are linked to wind\nand soil conditions.\nIndeed, climate change has led to an\naverage increase of 3 degrees Fahrenheit\nfor this time of year in California. This\nsignifies hotter winds during wildfire\nseason and drier soils. The combination\nproves to have immeasurable impacts on\nthe number, size and power of the fires;\n15 of the 20 largest fires in California\nhistory have happened since 2000 and\nthe area burned has increased by 500%.\nThe current climate trends could signify a longer wildfire season. However,\ngenerally, it is uncertain what climate\nchange will mean for the future. The\nfires may be less frequent, according to a\nstudy by Guzman-Morales and Gershunov from January 2019.\nWith powerful natural disasters increasing not only in rate but also in proximity to large cities, will the US rethink\nits current Climate plan?\nThe country\u2019s President seems set to\nleave the Paris agreement as soon as pos-sible; his administration is said to be beginning the official withdrawal from the\nParis accords on November the 4th. As\nthefireswillundoubtedlyhaveeffectson\nthecountry\u2019seconomyaswellasCalifornians health and way of life, politicians,\ninstitutions and major companies are\nretaliating by installing acts and encouraging the citizens to take action, despite\nthe White House\u2019s agenda.\nFor them, the fires have sparked new\nconversations on current and future\nplans to decrease carbon emissions. For\ninstance, democratic congresswoman\nAlexandriaOcasio-Cortezhasbeenvery\nactive on twitter to remind the people\nto act quickly before the consequences\nof climate change become irreversible.\n\u201cThis is what climate change looks like,\u201d\nshewroteofaphotoofthefire.\u201cWehave\n10 years to cut carbon emissions in half.\nIf we don\u2019t, scenes like this can get much\nworse.\u201d. She continues to strive for the\nacceptance of a Green New Deal - legislation centered around sustainability,\nfocusing on tackling climate change and\nfixing the current economic inequality.\nStates are trying to adopt legislation\nto transition to cleaner energy sources,\nbut the deadlines remain distant. For ex-ample, the 9 states making up 16% of the\nUS\u2019s electricity demand, including California, Washington and Nevada have\nenacted 100% clean energy legislation\nwith targets between 2040 and 2050.\nTo decrease carbon emissions, California is inspiring other states to join their\nzero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate\nrequiring automakers to sell electric ve-hicles.\nThere is also a notable increase of\ncommitments from cities: since 2017,\n80 cities have committed to 100% re-newables.\nFinally, two major energy companies,\nXcel Energy and National Grid, have\naimed to dramatically reduce carbon\nuse. Xcel, for example, plans to go 100%\ncoal free by 2030 and 100% carbon free\nby 2050.\nThere has been some pushback from\nthe administration against most of the\nacts put into place. For instance, they are\ntrying to revoke the changes that California had made on the Clean Air Act to\nResearchers show noise pollution is\nthreatening a large number of species\nNew research from Queen\u2019s University Belfast has indicated that\nnoise pollution is threatening to over\n100 different species.\nThe researchers found that noise affects\nthe behaviour of a wide range of species\nincluding amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptilians. Noise pollution can\naffect species by interfering with their\ncommunication, which is important for\npicking a mate or warning for predator;\nthis disruption may lead to lower survival rates.\nFurthermore, noise pollution may disturb the balance of ecosystems, by\nchanging the dynamics between prey\nand predators. For example, bats and\nowls rely on the sounds of the potential prey, and noise pollution makes it\nmore challenging to hear and find their\nprey, forcing them to invest more time\nin sourcing food, which could lead to a\ndecline in these species.\nIn the aquatic world, fish larvae find\ntheir home based on the sound emitted\nby reefs. Increased noise pollution in the\nsea, mainly as a result of ships, makes it\nmore difficult for fish larvae to find suitable reefs, leading many to choose less\nsuitable reefs, which may\nreduce their lifespan.\nNoise pollution also has a\nhuge impact on the natural\nmigration of animals. Many\nbirds will avoid noise polluted areas during migration\nwhich in turn affects where\nbirds choose to live. These\nchanges in distribution of\nspecies can in turn affect\necosystem health as each species forms\nan integral part in maintaining the functioning of a specific ecosystem.\nThe World Health Organisation has\npreviously said noise is one of the most\nhazardous forms of pollution for people,\nbut this new meta-study found that it\nhashugeeffectsonthebiologyandphys-iology of amphibians, arthropods, birds,\nfish, mammals, molluscs, and reptiles.\nIndeed, all organisms studied, terrestrial and aquatic, were found\nto be affected, indicating that\nnoise pollution affecting\nanimals is the norm,\nnot the exception.\nPrevious studies\nhave suggested that certain species are affected by noise pollu-tion, but this meta-study is the first of\nits kind to provide quantitative evidence\non a widespread of species to encourage\ninstitutions to regulate noise pollution.\nThe study analysed the effects of noise\nLeah Denoun Science Editor\nXiuchen Xu Sustainability Editor\nThis is a pretty endangered bird\nPhoto credits: Wikipedia\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia Commons\nWildfires in Yosemite 2009 were started by idiots who left their campfire unatended smouldering\nof birds in Britain\nare at risk of extinction or cats\n15%\nJ\nJo\noi\nin\nn t\nth\nhe\ne B\nBi\nig\ng M\nMo\no o\non\nn C\nCa\nam\nmp\npu\nus\ns c\nch\nha\nal\nll\nle\nen\nng\nge\ne h\nhe\ner\nre\ne,\n,\n\n"

These sequences,\nand the associated Cas9 protein, play an\nimportant role in the bacteria immunological response against bacteriophages\n(a type of viruses that only infect bac-teria). In a nutshell, Cas9 is an enzyme\nthat can bind and cleave specific DNA\nsequences, where recognition of these\nspecific sequences is directed by a sequence of nucleotides known as guide\nRNAs (gRNAs) that Cas9 binds to.\nThe gRNA-Cas9 complex searches the\nbacteria genome for the DNA sequence\ncomplementary to the gRNA. Once\nthe DNA sequence is found, Cas9 cuts\ndown across both strands. This break\nin the bacteria genome initiates the cellular process of genome repair, during\nwhich scientists can introduce desirable\nchanges the genome. The Cas9 protein\ncan also be engineered to perform other\nDNA-editing functions, such as point\nmutations (as opposed to insertions or\ndeletions) and DNA recombination.\nIts acronym was given by a Spanish\nprofessor from the Universidad of Alicante named Francisco Mojica, one of\nits discoverers, around 30 years ago; al-thoughwehadtowaituntilthepastdec-ade to see a real jump of CRISPR from\nacademic research to a ground-break-ing gene-editing tool. We attribute this\nmerit to three scientists: Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Feng\nZhang.\nCurrently, there are three main\nstreams of research with CRISPR: the\ndevelopment of CRISPR-Cas9 technol-ogy, the usage of CRISPR as a molecular marker, and genetic engineering. The\nlast application is undoubtedly the most\nexciting and complex one. A recent example of this is the creation of transpar-entsquidsinJuly2020bytheMarineBi-ological Laboratory, based in the USA.\nCephalopods have one of the most advanced nervous systems of the entire animal kingdom. Thus, transparent squids\nwould ease the research of the nervous\nsystem and maladies associated to it.\nOther medical applications of CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering are also\npopular fields of research. Many dire diseases are caused by gene mutations: can-cer, cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, and\nmany more. In theory, CRISPR-Cas9\ncould locate those defective genes and\ncorrect them, curing the disease in con-sequence. However, the practical application of genetic engineering in clinical\nmedicine is still far as it depends on the\ndevelopmentofamorepreciseandeffec-tive CRISPR-Cas 9 technology.\nCRISPR-Cas9 is advantageous in\nits preciseness. The guide RNA targets\na specific and short sequence of DNA,\nand can target changes to individual nu-cleotides.Whatmakesitsuperiortooth-er gene-editing methods mentioned in\nthe introduction, TALEN and ZFN, is\nthe ease at which CRISPR can be adapted for different uses. The basic Cas9 enzyme does not need to be re-engineered\neach time, only the guide RNA needs to\nbe changed, unlike TALEN and ZFN\nwhere an entire new set of proteins is\nrequired for each new target sequence.\nThe cost of using CRISPR-Cas9 is also\nrelatively low, for example, you may buy\na home kit CRISPR-Cas9 for less than\n$300.\nOn the other hand, we cannot neglect\nthat this technology requires improvements in terms of reliability and effec-tiveness. Genes are complex. Indeed, our\nunderstanding of the function of each\ngene and how they interact with each\nother are still incomplete. Therefore,\nmanipulating our genome probably can\npotentially cause catastrophic and unexpected consequences. Furthermore, editing of genome of germline cells might\ncause irreversible changes in the following generations. The most famous case is\nprobably the one of a Chinese scientist\nnamed He Jiankui, who manipulated\nthe DNA of two babies to presumably\nprevent them from contracting HIV because their father was HIV-positive. He\nJiankui\u2019s intentions could be truly altru-istic, even though most media claimed\nthat his only motivations were fame and\nwealth. Without further deliberation,\nthe Chinese justice system sentenced\nhim to prison and prohibited him from\nconducting biological research forever.\nTo conclude, CRISPR-Cas9 has the\npotential not only to change how we\nview life, but to change the fundamental rules of the game. It is undeniably an\nexciting path, but we should consider\neverything related to genetic engineering with caution.\nWang Guo Science Writer\nA Review of CRISPR: a blessing or a curse?\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia Commons, NHGRI\nContribute to\nFELIX!\nWe\u2019re looking for writers, illustrators,\ncopyeditors, and more...\nEmail felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

It\nis aimed at undergraduates and postgraduates who are\ninterested in applying to jobs in the financial sector\nbut have not had the opportunity\nto understand the terminology that these institutions hide\nbehind.\nThis year's course has transformed through the efforts of\nthe Investment and Finance\nSocieties and is such a departure\nfrom their usual course that\neven previous years' cohorts\nwere allowed to re-register.\nThese talks are given by\nImperial alumni and members\nof the Investment and Finance\nsocieties, which allows them to\npresent the course in such a way\nthat complete beginners (like\nme) can understand.\nThe four week course runs on Saturdays this month\nfrom 10am to 12nn, and features the following topics:\n1. Introductions (some basic definitions), Industry\nPlayers, and a career focus on Markets,\n2. Industry Players, Equities, and a career focus on\nIBD/Advisory,\n3. Fixed Income, Commodities, Real Estate and a\ncareer focus on Asset Management\n4. Alternatives such as Hedge Funds, Derivatives\nand a career focus on Quantitative Analysts\nThe first lecture was given by a pair of alums\nwho graduated in 2014, and they walked us through a\nfew basic terms:\nAsset = something you own\nE.g. A burger stand, or an uncashed check, or \u00a320\nin your pocket.\nEquity = portion of ownership in a company\nIf you start up a burger stand with a friend, you\nwould usually own 50% of the equity of the burger\nstand. Equity in more technical terms would be the\nsum of assets minus the sum of liabilities, and this is\njust fancy-speak for \"I bought my burger stand for\n\u00a330, but I borrowed \u00a320 from my mum to buy it. So\nthe total equity of my burger stand is \u00a310, of which\nmy friend and I own half of.\"\nFinancing = getting money\nOr in a lengthier definition, either borrowing\nmoney (raising debt) or selling off parts of what you\nown (e.g. shares), which is called raising equity. In our\nburger stand example, you can access (= get)\nfinance (=\u00a3\u00a3) by borrowing more money\nfrom your mum, or raise equity (= worth)\nby renting out some space on your stand for\nadverts.\nSecurity = contract to pay something off\nIn fancy-speak, it's called a 'financial\ninstrument'. Technical terms: An asset or a\ncontract that you can trade and make money from the trade of.\nFor example, you have blackmailed\nanother friend, and you have in writing that\nthey now owe you \u00a3100. That's a security\n(= promise). You are secure in the promise\nthat your now-probably-not friend will pay\nyou \u00a3100 at some point. You can sell off\nthis security to another person, or keep it.\nEither way, you're getting some money out\nof it.\nHere are a few more technical\nterms:\nFixed Income (from a debt) =\nSomeone gives you a fixed amount\nof cash at fixed times, also known as\na bond.\nCredits = bonds issued out by companies only, and not countries.\nFor example, you wouldn't be\ngetting credit if you bought bonds\nin the British government, but you\ncan always obtain a fixed income by\ncharging interest on a loan.\nThe financial services industry\nis huge, and comprises sectors that you may or may\nnot have heard of: Banking, Insurance, Financing,\nPayments, Investing (and more). However, the biggest\nsectors are known as sell-side and buy-side, and this is\nwhat our speakers focussed on.\nSell-side = access to financing or the ability to trade\nSome examples: banks that loan you money, or\ntrading platforms.\nSell-side firms would underwrite loans (do loads of\nrisk assessment, e.g. your mum thinks you trustworthy\nenough to loan you \u00a320 for the burger stand.\nThey would also buy and sell shares for a fund, or of\na new company. (also called an IPO), e.g. those who\ndecide to buy up advertising space on your stand.\nSell-side is split up into public and private markets.\nPublic markets are those that help market players buy\nand sell securities, while private markets help other\ncompanies access finances.\nSell-side services for public markets are split up into\nmini-sectors you may have heard, like Sales &Trading,\nResearch, and Public Markets. Private markets can\nalso be split up, but into more fancy terms, like 'Debt\n& Equity Capital Markets', Mergers&Acquisitions,\nand Leveraged Finance.\nSell-side companies can be split into two - Buble\nBrackets, and Boutiques/Trading Firms.\nBuy-side = buy and/or sell securities\nFor example, someone would like to buy your IOU\nor sell you another IOU. (e.g. your friend signs an\nI-Owe-yoU \u00a3100 contract)\nNow, this can be split into two types of companies.\nA Hedge Fund can choose to buy advertising space\nfrom you whenever they like. A Private Equity Fund\nwould borrow money from a bank to buy your entire\nburger stand from you, as they think they can bring\nin more income if they managed it themselves. An\nexample would be someone walking up to your stand\nand offering you \u00a380 to buy the entire thing.\nSome last thoughts on the first lecture:\nThe slides are amazing and very detailed. This may\nsometimes make the pace of the talks a bit fast, but if\nyou focus on what is being said, you can always study\nthe slides better after the lecture. This lecture series\nisn't recorded (unlike all of your normal lectures), so\nyou have to either be there for it or live vicariously\nthrough the reviews published in Felix\neach week.\nThe course is graded through a\ncombination of attendance and a final\nassessment. Attending each of the four\nlectures contributes to 10% of your\nfinal grade, and in my opinion, it's\nworth it. You really do have to watch\nout for the QR code to register your\nattendance though, as it's easy to miss\nin between slides!!There was so much\nuseful information packed into those\ntwo hours that just can't be conveyed through looking at the slides.\nAlthough I do wish they had been\nrecorded, it's an amazing opportunity\neither way, and the slides uploaded to\nthe Teams help with reviewing the material through\nthe week.\nSecurities & Education Cert-Watch (1/4)\nLook at what you're missing out on!\nAmeena Hassan\nSEC student, Writer\nThe Securities and Education Certificate is a\nqualification awarded by Imperial's very own\nInvestment and Finance Societies. It is being run by\nImperial students to teach other Imperial students\nthe fundamental knowledge about Investment and\nbanking that is required for a career in these fields\nwhich have been shrouded in mystery due to overcomplicated terms.

That said, it was the broken English\nstamped on the cover in the bold white font that\ninstantly drew me in. I recall thinking why did the\nauthor choose to write \u2018louding\u2019 instead of \u2018loud\u2019?\nI would soon find out that Nigerian author Abi\nDar\u00e9 was very intentional in her use of broken, or non-standard, English, which she also used throughout\nthe book to embody the narrator and protagonist; a\nfourteen-year old Nigerian girl called Adunni who was\npulledoutofschoolbecauseshecouldn\u2019taffordthefees.\n\u2018The girl with the louding voice\u2019 starts with her life of\npoverty in the small, rural village of Ikati.

However, as a society we\nhave collectively turned a blind eye towards the devastating impacts that one\nbillion domestic, feral, and free-rang-ing dogs impose on wildlife globally.\nReports and studies have highlighted that feral and free-ranging dogs have\nbeen largely responsible for disrupting ecosystems by killing wild animals,\ntransmitting dangerous diseases, and\neven interbreeding with other canids.\nStudies have revealed that feral dogs\nare a potential threat to 188 endangered and threatened species global-ly. They have also been responsible for\nthe extinction of 11 vertebrates in the\nrecent past. With an exorbitant number of feral dogs roaming around close\nproximity of various wild reserves, they\ncan compete with other carnivores\nfor prey. There has been vast evidence\nof this including camera trap records\nshowing dogs feeding on wild carcasses\nSuch scavenging and killing of wild\nanimals by feral dogs have exacerbated\nthe negative impacts of dogs on wildlife especially in biodiversity hotspots\nlike India. A striking example of this is\nthe Great Indian Bustard, only 150 of\nwhich remain in the wild, which has\nbeen threatened by feral dogs in Rajasthan (State in India). Since the feral\ndog density is high compared to natural predators, the frequency of prey\nspecies getting attacked in the forest\nacross India has been extortionate.\nIn the UK, wildlife can similarly\nsuffer at the paws of \u2018feral cats\u2019, which\nroam across the countryside killing local wildlife and threatening the populations of European Wildcats through\ntransmitting diseases and interbreeding\nwith them. Speaking of diseases, this is\nanother way that feral dogs can threaten\nwildlife. Free-ranging dogs are known\nto carry diseases like Rabies which are\ntransmitted to animals like, wolf, jack-als, deer, foxes etc. during their close\nencounters with these wild animals.\nWhile activities like predation,\nhybridization, disease transmission\nthrough feral dogs and their repercussions on wildlife have been reported\nthrough several studies by conservation-ists, efforts towards mitigating these effects have not been investigated in their\nentirety. Unfortunately, the primary\nway proposed to deal with the issue is\nthrough the inhumane killing of feral\ndogs, rather than considering more sustained methods like animal birth con-trol, dog sterilization or restricting the\nfree-ranging behaviour of the animals.\nHopefully, through future emphasis\non these strategies we can minimize\nthe encounters dogs have with the wild\nanimals thus, helping numerously endangered species to persist in the wild.\nPhoto credits: Shantanu Sharma\nCoach accused of greenwashing\nCoach, the designer brand known\nfor its high-end bags and shoes,\nhas come under fire after environmental activist Anna Sacks posted a video\non TikTok exposing the company for\ntheir unmistakeable greenwashing. The\nvideo shows Sacks holding up handbags\nthat have been purposely slashed and\ndamaged by Coach employees, under instructions from the company to do this.\nSacks explains that the reason for this is\na tax loophole that allows these bags to\nbe categorised under accidental damage\n\u2013 leading to a reduced tax bill. After the\nunwanted merchandise is cut up, employees are told to throw them away in\ndumpsters behind malls, which is where\ntheywerefoundbyTiffanyShe\u2019ree (@\ndumpsterdivingmama on Instagram),\nwhose hobby is combing through\ndumpsters to find salvageable goods.\nAll this is in stark contrast to Coach\u2019s\nmerchandise repairing scheme, Coach\nRe(Loved), with the slogan \u201cDon\u2019t\nDitch It, Repair It\u201d. Coach has a policy of taking in damaged goods from\ncustomers and repairing it for them.\nOn their website, they state that \u201cit\u2019s\nanother small thing we can do to keep\nbags out of landfill and reduce our impact on the planet\u201d. The thousands of\npeople who have voiced their opinions\non this controversy online seem to all\nagree that the irony of this is unbearable.\nHowever, this type of practice is not\nexclusive to Coach \u2013 it seems to be a\ncommon theme among clothing retail\nbrands. In 2017, Swedish brand H&M\nwas famously exposed for allegedly\nburning 12 tonnes of unsold clothing\neach year, despite pushing an image of\nsustainability in their marketing. British\nluxury brand Burberry admitted in their\n2018 annual report to destroying \u00a326.6\nmillion pounds worth of merchandise\nto retain a reputation of exclusivity\nin their products. Across the board,\nranging from affordable companies to\nhigh-end designer brands, there is a\nglaring problem in the fashion industry.\nAfter Sacks\u2019 TikTok inevitably went\nviral, Coach saw a 44 percent plummet\nin online sales. Following the backlash,\nthe company published an apology post\non their Instagram, stating that they\nhave \u201cceased destroying in-store returns\nof damaged or unsellable goods\u201d. They\nalso mentioned that last year, they donated $55 million to \u201clow-income fam-ilies, individuals in need, those re-en-tering the workforce and educational\nprograms\u201d \u2013 an interesting inclusion\nthat commenters under the post described as a performative apology. This\ntype of response seems to be a classic\ncase of being sorry that they got caught,\nnot that they did it in the first place.\nThis controversy points to the bigger problem of consumer culture\nand the fashion industry\u2019s large-scale\nhabit of polluting the environment.\nClearly, there is something wrong\nwith the way these companies operate and policies to prevent these types\nof practices should be implemented.\nSrigan Moharir Environment Writer\nMarie Mori Environment Editor\n\n"

    "content": "How to walk out of the shadow of Oxbridge.\n\u201cHow did you fail the Oxbridge\ninterview and come to\nImperial?\u201d This was one of the most\ncommon (and embarrassing) questions\nI have heard since coming here. Imperial\nis one of the top universities, and\nthere was a time, particularly in 2015,\nImperial even surpassed\nOxford and ranked 2nd\nin QS World University\nRanking. But the weird\nthing is that despite\ncontinuously staying in\nthe top 10 list of QS,\nImperial still cannot\nget rid of the \u201chonorary\ntitle\u201d: Top Backup\nChoice for Oxbridge\nStudents. Of course,\ncoming to Imperial\ndoesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re\nanyway subordinate to\nOxbridge students. But\nfrom time to time, I\nwould wonder whether\nthere will be a day\nwhen Imperial gives up\nthe title of \u201cOxbridge\nbackup\u201d and proudly stands alongside\nnot only Oxbridge but Harvard and\nMIT. As Imperial students, we all\nshare the responsibility to better our\ncommunity,andIbelieveweallhopethis\nwill one day come true. I am writing this\narticletosharesomethoughtsonthishot\ntopic, and hopefully, it will light the way.\nSo, isn\u2019t the ranking accurate enough\nto show the competence? Well, forget\nabout QS ranking. If given appropriate\ntime, an average person won\u2019t find it\nhard to realise that Yale is not on the\ntop 10 list. The same goes for Princeton,\nColumbia, and UC Berkeley. Top-tier\nuniversities don\u2019t necessarily need a\ngood ranking to let people know that\n\u201cthey are good\u201d. And in fact, Imperial\nowns the title of \u201ctop\n10\u201d only for QS this\nyear\u2014not in Times,\nnot in US News, and\nnot in ARWU. This is\nnothing to really brag\nabout, and surely it\ncannot be our biggest\nadvertisement. Just\nsuppose next year\nImperial drops out of\nthetop10QSlist.How\nawkward it shall be!\nWhere are we\nlagging? Notably,\nalumni. One of the\nmost significant\ncontrasts between\nImperial and top-tier\nplayers should be the\nnumber of Nobel Prize\nwinners. Harvard has 165, Cambridge\n121, Oxford 72, but Imperial has only\n14 officially. The Nobel Winner page on\nthe Imperial website has been quiet for\nmore than 40 years (the latest laureate\nwas Abdus Salam in 1979). Frankly\nspeaking, except for a few people like\nAlexander Fleming, we can barely find\nany household names. This strange\nphenomenon has even aroused doubts\non whether Imperial is only nominally\ngood. It\u2019s not easy to get a Nobel\nPrize. It\u2019s even harder to get household\nnames (how many Nobel laurates\u2019\nnames can you remember?). But that\u2019s\nthe characteristic of a top-tier player.\nDon\u2019t frown. There is a way we can\nchange it. The time has come that we\nshould not be blinded by competition\nwith other universities but flourish\nin our own unique way. Students,\nprofessors, staff, and researchers\nshould not come to Imperial merely\nfor trivial personal interest, namely\nmoney. What we need are scientists,\nengineers, businessmen, and doctors\naimed to lead and change the world.\nWhat we need most is AMBITION.\nOnce, I heard somebody say that\nImperial lacks the soul. It holds true\ntoday. And facing up to this dilemma\nis more urgent than ever. Last year, we\ncancelled the motto Scientia imperii\ndecus et tutamen to protest against\ncolonialism,yetwe\u2019restillembarrassingly\nusing the colonial name, \u201cImperial\u201d\nCollege London. Positioning ourselves\nin the 21stCentury where the colonial\nempire has long collapsed, countries\nworldwide are caught in a fierce science\nand technology race, and humans are\nfacing an unprecedented climate crisis,\nwhat kind of new role shall we play?\nThe mission lies on us. The students,\nresearchers, staff\u2014everybody in this\nuniversitysharestheresponsibilitytofind\nour way forward. President Alice Gast,\nandtheincomingPresidentHughBrady,\nshould aim at uniting the university and\nreigniting the university\u2019s mission in the\n21st Century. Researchers, students,\nstaff alike\u2014dream big, work hard, go\nwhere there is no path and leave a trail.\nIt\u2019s not Oxbridge that matters. They\nare not worthwhile for us to waste\ntime on them. Ignite the passion,\nmake the difference, and follow our\nheart. We are from Imperial College\nLondon, and we will pave our way.\nWhy isn\u2019t Imperial on par with Oxbridge?\nRuntianWu\nWriter\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n30 Comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment Have an article in mind?\nEmail your idea or article to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPhoto credits: Ben Seymour on Unsplash\nOxford University campus Queen\u2019s Tower - Imperial campus\nPhoto credits: Imperial College London\nWHAT WE\nNEED ARE\nSCIENTISTS,\nENGINEERS,\nBUSINESSMEN,\nAND DOCTORS\nAIMED TO\nLEAD AND\nCHANGE THE\nWORLD.\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "We at the sports section of Felix\nhave recently becoming quite\nintrigued about the idea of doing a marathon (whether this ever becomes more\nthan an idea is another story\u2026) after\nsupporting a very good\nfriend of ours during\ntheir Royal Parks half\nmarathon. Therefore,\nwe thought it best to\nask someone who is\na bit of an expert in\nthem; Imperials very\nown head of rowing,\nPeterHardcastle.Many\nof you may not know\nhim but he has been head coach at Imperial since 2017 and before he was a coach\nhe was actually a three time Olympian\n(2000, 2004, 2008) for Australia as a\nrower. On top of this he has competed\nto the very highest level in triathlons,\nculminating in winning his division of\nIronman Wales in 2015 and qualifying\nfor the Ironman world championships\nin Kona Hawaii twice. After these sporting achievements he decided to take\nthings \u2018easier\u2019 by focussing on only doing\nmarathons. To this date he has competed in many marathons and repeatedly\nachieved a sub three-hour\ntime. A few weeks ago, he\ncompeted in the Berlin\nmarathon and once again\nposted a great time. Here\nhe is answering a few\nof our questions about\ntraining for a marathon\nand what they are actually like to compete in.\nHow did you go\nabout training for the marathon?\nTraining for this marathon was different to others as I didn\u2019t have my\nnormal training runs and routes. I was\non holidays with my family over the\nsummer so had to do my best to find\nruns here and there. Sometimes there\nwere only hills and sometimes there\nwas only altitude as I was in the Alps.\nBut in general, my training plan is to\ndo three key running sessions per week.\nWhat is your background in running and how difficult was it to train?\nI have been a rower, then did Ironmans including two World Championships in Kona, Hawaii. I am now\nrunning as it\u2019s less time consuming.\nWhat goes through your head during\na marathon? It\u2019s such a long period of\ntime to be running continuously\ncan you describe\nwhat that is like\nfor our readers?\nI break it all\ndown into smaller chunks of each\nkilometre and sets\nof kilometres. I\nalso try to run at\nthe pace I want to\nbe at and then relax and focus on\nmy breathing along\nwith looking at my watch and keeping\nmy heart rate at a certain level. As kilometres tick by I adjust those heart rate\nlevels. This is because if I let my heart\nrate spike or get caught out running\ntoo fast I will pay for it later on in the\nrace. Along with this I look around at\nall the buildings, landmarks and crowds\nand enjoy the atmosphere of the event.\nHow did you feel the marathon went?\nI feel it went really well. I went sub\nthree hours (2:57:18) which was my\ngoal. It wasn\u2019t a personal best but was\nan enjoyable race. Both half\u2019s of the\nrace were very similar, with the last 5km\nfaster than the first 5km and the second\nlast 5km fastest than the second 5km.\nEverything in the middle was consistent.\nWillyoubedoingthisagainandifso,\nwhatfutureeventsareyouhopingtogoto?\nYes, my goal is to complete the\nsix majors. I have now done London and Berlin and still have Tokyo,\nNew York, Boston and Chicago to do.\nWhat\u2019s the atmosphere like in a marathon?\nThe crowds in the major marathons\nare really good as they are lined all the\nway on both sides of the road. However, the crowd at the start is also amaz-ing. Hearing the top elite runners in\nthe world read out in front of you and\nstarting with tens of thousands of people creates a fantastic atmosphere.\nWhat tips would you give to someone who\u2019s never run a marathon before?\nStart with a training programme\nthat\u2019s achievable.\nHave key sessions\neach week, these\nneed to be progressive and allow\nfor you to build\nconfidence. Set\nout your plan prior to the day on\nhow you are going\nto pace it. Know\nyour nutrition\nplan and when\nyou\u2019re going to\nconsume energy.\nDo smaller races first and build to half\nmarathon before running a full mar-athon. I am happy for anyone to contact me if you want any help or advice.\nWhat running gear did\nor did not work for you?\nI don\u2019t trial gear on the day. I know\nmy nipples will bleed and I might get\na sore toe. However, I might try to\ninvest in getting a lighter singlet as\nmy one holds to much water more.\nWe hope that this conversation with\nPeter Hardcastle makes you considering\ngetting into running and potential have\na go at racing a marathon. Remember to\ntake it slow and ask for plenty of help\nalong the way if you are new to the sport.\nThere are many sports clubs at Imperial\nthat would love to lend a hand in completing your running, or any other sport,\ngoals. If any imperial student has recently completed a marathon and has anything they would like to add then do not\nhesitate to contact the sports section.\nFRIDAY 22ND OCTOBER 2021\n31\nSport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWant to try and run a Marathon?

With no legislature to protect\nconsumers, companies are free to make\nrepairs as difficult as possible, turning\nconsumers into cash cows. For better or\nfor worse, Apple sets the trends in tech-nology, and they have been at the forefront of this change.\nTake, for example, the back glass of\nmodern iPhones. The majority of the industry uses normal adhesive which can\nbe softened by heat, with an easy repair\nprocess costing about \u00a340. Apple, how-ever, use a permanent adhesive and then\nweld their camera lenses to the frame after the glass is in place. Apple will charge\nyou upwards of \u00a3560 to repair this \u2013 or,\nconveniently, about \u00a3100 less than just\nbuying a brand new iPhone. It does not\nmatter if this new iPhone is made from\n100% recycled materials or not \u2013 the\npoint is that there should be no need for\nit in the first place. Designing devices\nlike this is effectively designing e-waste.\nNot content with forcing independent repair shops to spend thousands on\nspecialised equipment to do these re-pairs, Apple has started to restrict the\nscope of these businesses even further.\nIn recent iPhone models, Apple has\nstarted to pair key phone components\nsuch as the battery, screen, and cameras\nto the phone at the factory. Swapping\nthese components \u2013 even with genuine\nreplacements from a brand new phone \u2013\nwill disable key features and cause error\nmessages to come cascading into your\nnotifications. The only ones with the\npowertooverridethesemessagesareAp-ple themselves. More niche repairs are\nsimply not possible outside of Apple\u2019s\necosystem, with exclusivity contracts on\ncomponent manufacturers forbidding\nthem from selling spare parts to repair\nshops.\nTo put it simply, Apple has been\nspending vast amounts of R&D time\nand money, not to improve their product but to make it difficult to repair. This\nis a cost that is paid by all of us \u2013 the\nconsumer, local businesses and the environment are all suffering due to Apple\u2019s\nobsession for control, and this is a trend\nthat must be stopped.\nThis week in Science...\nPotential energy production from rooftop solar panels could\nexceed energy used in 2019\nFruit flies smell even when asleep\nLargest koala chlamydia vaccine trial commenced in australia\nIn a first of its kind study, researchers at Imperial College London, University College Cork and Columbia University have identified \u201chotspots\u201d where placement of solar panels could generate the most energy.\nThe article published in Nature Communications identified 0.2 million\nkm2 of rooftop area from 130 million km2 of global land surface area\nand calculated the total global potential for petawatt-hour to be generat-ed. They found it could be 27 petawatt-hour per year (compared to 6pwh\nused globally in 2019). Solar panel technology and affordability is im-proving, but the usefulness of this energy production will yet depend on\ndevelopments in solar panel energy storage.\nHave you ever been peacefully woken up to the gorgeous smells of fresh\ntoast,sizzlingeggsandbacon,torealiseyouwerestarving?Meneither,but\nI know some fruit flies who have been so lucky. We have long known that\nhuman can process \u201csalient\u201d information (information that requires subconscious processing, like the smell of food or the calling of your name)\nwhilst asleep. Researchers at Imperial College London used an ethoscope\nto perform high-throughput behavioural analyses on thousands of fruit\nflies, and found they respond to a number of odours, particularly those\nthey are averse to. More impressively, they found that starved flies are\nmore responsive to food odours than non-food odours. The researchers\nalso found the region of the brain that stays awake during sleep, which is\nharder to trace in humans.\nResearchers in Queensland, Australia have commenced the largest clinical trial of a vaccine against Chlamydia pecorum in koalas. Chlamydia is\nrampant in koala population, with some populations testing up to 100%\nfor the debilitating and often deadly disease. Since 2018, Australia has\nseen its koala populations decline by around 30%, chlamydia is one of the\ndriving forces behind it. The research group has spent over 10 years developing this vaccine. Initial trials have proven positive, with the vaccine\nreducing both infection rate and symptoms. In this trial 200 koalas at the\nAustralian Wildlife Hospital will be vaccinated, and the efficacy of the\nvaccine will be assessed by comparing the hospitalisation rates of these\nkoalas with 200 who are unvaccinated.\nFROM IMPERIAL...\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nLucy explores the asteroid belt\nNASA\u2019s Lucy spacecraft launched this week atop an Atlas V 401. Lucy,\nnamed after the hominin fossil, will conduct fly-bys of 8 different asteroids over its 12-year mission duration. It carries a variety of scientific\ninstruments derived from earlier NASA missions, along with a golden\nplaque bearing quotes, poems, and songs from people around the world\nincluding Imperial alum Brian May.

    "content": "Imperial Athletes announces changes to sport at\nImperial\nSory Rewart NegaFelix Paris Correspondent\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n18 Felixonline.co.uk\nCATNIP\nImperial athletes (IA), the much criticised system\nfor sports club funding, implemented last year have\nannounced that they will be responding to complaints\nthat the system does not provide value for money, that\nit makes little sense for smaller, solo sport societies\nand that it erases clubs\u2019 individuality with a rebrand\nand a new way of working.\nLaunching after Christmas, Athletes of Imperial\n(AI) will, spokesperson Pasho Ver told NegaFelix,\n\u201crobustly respond to students concerns in order to\ndeliver the best version of sport for Imperial students\u201d.\nThese changes come from a series of student and\nstaff consultations done between last November and\nJanuary.\nNegaFelix reporter Mick \u2018Marmalade\u2019 Fronk has\nbeen able to have a look at the proposals before they\nare published next week.\nThere is some sadness among the student community\nabout the demise of the beloved IA organisation.\nFeb Senton, a fourth year Civ Eng student and keen\nathlete told NegaFelix \u201cI am really sad to see Imperial\nAthletes go. As a weekly golf, rugby, football and\nwater polo player as well as a semi-serious rower\nand triathlete I found the \u00a325 joining fee really\neconomical!\u201d\nAgreeing to speak to NegaFelix under a false name,\na source, described as high up in the Union, Romeo\nVenusden said \u201cTo be honest, having the College do\nall of this is going to take a lot of work off my, I mean\nsomeone\u2019s, plate\u201d.\nA prominent club captain, Rugger McKickabout\nwas relaxed about the changes saying \u201cI don\u2019t really\nunderstand what people didn\u2019t like about Imperial\nAthletes. We got loads of money every year. But\nI don\u2019t want to come across as indifferent to the\nsituation of smaller clubs. So if any other club captain\ncan beat me in a pint downing contest then I will be\nhappy to give them 10% of our social event budget.\u201d\nOur correspondent writes\nThe changes put forward in the AI mission statement are clearly meant as rebuttals to accusations made by students. However, it is clear that AI have made a number\nof errors in their survey and consultation process which have led them astray.\nWhile some of these changes are comical, a rule banning any form of face covering was clearly aimed at students who did not like wearing COVID masks, though it\nalso names swimming goggles, cricket helmets, fencing masks and gumshields in its prohibition, other rules are less benign.\nThe decision to provide students with a fully itemised bill at the end of each week will certainly let students see where their money is being spent but the creation of a\nnew class of sport societies called \u201cPovo socs\u201d offering sports such as nose picking, underground bare knuckle boxing and mud flinging for the low price of only \u00a31.50 a\nyear might create more problems than it solves.\nMeanwhile, club history and individuality has been addressed with a total prohibition on uniforms of any sort. Smaller clubs that found the Imperial Athletes\nmembership price too high for them will also be folded into one another in order to make their existence economical. The report contains a number of suggestions\nof the new and exciting sports that might develop out of this, including Post Modern Pentathlon consisting of Pole Dancing, Archery, Parkour, Ultimate Frisbee and\nSailing as well as Snooker Fencing, in which epees and sabres lunges are used to knock balls around the table\nOur correspondent writes\nImperial fails to impress in the Earthshot\ncompetition\nThe joint Imperial Engineers and UCL psychologist\nteam working out of the City and Guilds building\nwere told that their plan to \u201carm animals with modern\nweapons in order to give nature a fighting chance\u201d was\nboth irresponsible and missed the point. The judges\ndid concede however, that the flamethrower hippo\nwas pretty cool. Not even the cutting edge work done\nby the UCL team to imbue their test subjects with\nburning hatred towards humans nor their ability to hit\na moving target at 300 yards was found praise worthy.\nThe team are not too disappointed, however. Since the\ncompetition they have been approached by numerous\nstate organisations interested in their work. Feb\nSenton, lead researcher, told NegaFelix that their most\nrecent project, a wasp that can both sting you and tell\nyou to go fuck yourself was going down very well.\nThe recent Earthshot prize announcement ceremony brought disgrace to the competing Imperial teams. Of the 5 categories available, Imperial\u2019s teams came last in\nevery single one. Here is what the judges said about the ICL efforts.\nProtect and restore nature Prize\nSory Rewart NegaFelix Paris Correspondent\n\n"

Both actresses bring something different to the roles. Barks sings\nimpeccably and embodies Elsa\u2019s icy demeanour, while\nMcKeon\u2019s high energy and fun tone works perfectly for\nthe younger princess.\nOne of the most adored and recognisable characters\nfrom the movie, Olaf (Craig Gallivan), enters late in\nthe show but still manages to capture the most laughs\nand love from the audience. Kristoff (Obioma Ugoala)\nis another character oozing with personality and portrayed by a performer who exudes even more talent. It\nwould have been great to see more of him, rather than\nonly a ten-minute song about the Danish concept of\nHygge featuring naked dancers coming in and out of\na sauna. This was funny at the time but didn\u2019t add that\nmuch to an already jam-packed show where some characters needed a bit more time to shine.\nThe special effects and overall stage design were so\nsensational it sometimes felt as though other aspects\nof the show were easily overlooked. For example, the\nchoreography of the large ballroom dance numbers. In\nthe first half, the ensemble were easily overshadowed\nby other happenings on stage but, in the final ice scene,\ntheir coordination and ability to portray the emotion\nfinally began to shine.\nThe young girls who portrayed Young Anna (Sum-mer Betson) and Young Elsa (Minaii.K) must be commended for their difficult task of opening the first thirty minutes of the show. Betson, who makes her West\nEnd debut playing Anna, showed extraordinary talent,\nperfectly conveying the young energetic princess while\nsinging, dancing, and bicycling all over the stage.\nOverall, this is a must-see show, even the purist of\ntheatre lovers can appreciate the spectacle and, for anyone else, the effects will blow you away, and the refreshing story will make you a bit teary but very happy.

    "content": "The first time I listened to The Greeting Committee\nwas in January 2019 when Spotify suggested them to\nme, so I have whatever algorithm that was responsible\nforthattothankforthediscoveryofoneofmyfavourite\nbands. The track I heard was\n\u2018Hands Down\u2019, an energetic love\nsong driven by bright guitars\nand upbeat percussion. Now,\nthe band have released their\nsecond studio album Dandelion\nand gone are the professions\nof love by lead singer Addie\nSartino but the lyrical charm\nthat she possesses still shines on\nevery track.\nAt its core, Dandelion is a\nbreak-up album. Addie told\nAtwood Magazine, \u201cElise [my\ngirlfriend] and I have been\ntogether for five years. But in\n2019, we broke up for about\nfour or five months and I was\njust devastated.\u201d The album is\na guide through Addie\u2019s mind during the process of\nthe breakup. The album is about accepting that we all\nexperience grief, it is about dealing with the grief and\nfinally, it is about the growth we see on the other side\nof it.\nThe first track on the album (which was also the\nfirst single that was released from the album), \u2018Can I\nLeave Me Too?\u2019, sets off on the grieving process. It is\na plea to the person you have lost. The first line, \u201cwhy\ndoeseveryonedrivethesamecaryoudo?\u201d,issomething\nanyone can relate to. When we lose someone or\nsomethingimportantitbecomeshardtogoaboutdaily\nlife without being constantly reminded of the loss. The\nability to create such relatable moments within her\nlyricswhicharesopersonalhighlightAddie\u2019sincredible\nsong writing talent.\nThe feelings explored in the album can be seen\nchanging as the album progresses with grief being\nexplored through bargaining,\nself-loathing and the ups and\ndowns of healing. Just as the\ncathartic and driving \u2018Make\nOut\u2019 ends, the self-referential\n\u2018So It Must Be True\u2019 begins.\n\u2018Make Out\u2019 is one of my two\nfavouritetracksfromDandelion\n(I can\u2019t choose between it and\n\u2018How Long?\u2019). It is the most\nfun track on an album that is\ninherently about sadness and\nperfectly encapsulates letting\ngo of all cares. The kazoo-like\nsounds in the breaks (which\nI think are heavily distorted\nbacking vocals, but I am almost\ndefinitely wrong) are one of my\nfavourite new sounds on a track\nI\u2019ve ever heard. The track reminds me of artists like\nThe Regrettes or Lauran Hibberd with its gritty guitar,\nalmost conversational vocals -and ending with a \u2018bleurgh\u2019 from\nAddie, the regret after certain\nnights out is contained within\none sound.\nThe conversational vocals\ncontinue at the start of \u2018So It\nMust Be True\u2019. Addie speaks\ndirectly to the listener: \u201cback to\nthe wall / this record is one long\nsigh\u201d, \u201chere\u2019s your love song, cause\nit\u2019s what everybody wants.\u201d The\nsong is self-referential at heart,\neven referencing The Strokes,\nwho are one of the bands own\nadmitted influences, in the line\n\u201cgoing all Julian\u201d as a guitar plays a part that would fit\nperfectlyon Is This It.Afterthefreedomof \u2018MakeOut\u2019,\n\u2018So It Must Be True\u2019 realises that the feelings of love\nare still there for the person that was lost despite all the\ngrief experienced. It is the frustration felt when loving\nsomeone even though you feel you should hate them.\nDandelion also does what This Is It, The Greeting\nCommittee\u2019s first studio album, didn\u2019t always manage\n\u2013itfeelsgigantic.Pierce,thebassistintheband,credits\nthis to Dave Fridmann who mixed the album. It is\nmusic to walk down the street to and feel on top of the\nworld. Tracks that are sonically massive are perfectly\nfollowed by others that are beautifully sparse. This\nis most noticeable between \u2018So It Must Be True\u2019 and\n\u2018Wrapped Inside of your Arms\u2019 which is the single love\nsong on the album that Addie wrote around 5 years ago\nat a similar time to \u2018Elise\u2019, a single from 2017 written\nabout Addie\u2019s long-term girlfriend of the same name.\nThe album\u2019s heartbreak can be felt even more after\nknowingthis.\u2018Elise\u2019ispossiblyoneofthemostbeautiful\nlove songs to have been written\nin this century. It is personal\nand yet relatable. After listening\nto \u2018Elise\u2019, it is easy to imagine\nthe pain that led to Dandelion\nafter the breakup. By the end of\nDandelion, the grief felt has not\nyet been overcome but it has been\naccepted and healing has begun.\nWith 3 tracks on the soundtrack\nand a cameo in Netflix\u2019s \u2018To All\nthe Boys: Always And Forever\u2019,\nhints of an upcoming tour and a\nstellarsecondalbum,TheGreeting\nCommittee are definitely on their\nway to being a chart-topping band\nand I\u2019d recommend everybody to listen to them.\n25\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nDandelion by The Greeting Committee\nWritten by Joe Riordan Music Writer\nFelix Recommends\n\u201c\nIT IS THE\nFRUSTRATION FELT\nWHEN LOVING\nSOMEONE EVEN\nTHOUGH YOU FEEL\nYOU SHOULD HATE\nTHEM\n\u201c\nWHEN WE LOSE\nSOMEONE\nIMPORTANT IT\nBECOMES HARD TO\nGO ABOUT DAILY\nLIFE WITHOUT\nBEING CONSTANTLY\nREMINDED OF THE\nLOSS\nPhoto credits to Envato Elements\nFRIDAY 22ND OCTOBER 2021\nMUSIC\n\n"

Through poetic words and honest interpretations, this play gives\nten people a platform to speak about problems that\nmany of us face but are rarely discussed.\nOne particularly emotional story focused on a man\nlearning to appreciate the small joys of life that he used\nto take for granted, now that they are no longer the\nnorm. For all of us, 2020 brought a Christmas like no\nother. While many spent the festive season without\ntheir loved ones, unable to ignore the loneliness and\nhopelessness that came with it, there were still many\nlessons to be learned. This individual\u2019s monologue\nstarts with him alone on Christmas day. The turn in the\nstory arrives with his neighbours, who came to share\ntheir food. This small act of kindness and generosity\nmoves him to tears, shortly before his own family show\nup on his doorstep. It was clear that his authentic portrayal had struck a chord with most of the audience.\nAnothernoteworthystorywastoldbyayoungwoman who feared for her safety on the tube.
