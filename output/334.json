    "content": "Page 2 FELIX May3 rd,1973 PRESIDENT'S COLUMN\nNext Monday and Tuesday polling takes place\nfor President and Honorary Secretary of IC Union\nand there are a number of compelling reasons why\nyou should sacrifice five minutes of your valuable\ntime to mark a ballot paper.\nThere is a wide spectrum of opinion among the\ncandidates and moreover anyone Who was thinking of standing has had two months to make up his or her own mind. A President elected now will have\na real chance to get the Union into shape to get\nhis policies carried out. He needs to get ALL his departmental representatives working \u2014 both bringing up issues from his department for the Union to take up (as was the\ncase with the improvements in field course financing) and involving his students in implementing Union policies (as a FEW did this year with the\ngrants campaign). He needs to be quite ruthless\nin getting rid of dep reps Who go to sleep and do nothing as several did this year. This would be\none essential way of strengthening the union by stronger links with the ordinary members.\nHe needs to get ALL his departmental representatives working \u2014 both bringing up issues from\nhis department for the Union to take up (as was the case with the improvements in field course\nfinancing) and involving his students in implementing Union policies (as a FEW did this year with the\ngrants campaign). He needs to be quite ruthless\nin getting rid of dep reps who go to sleep and do nothing as several did this year. This would be\none essential way of strengthening the union by\nstronger links with the ordinary members.\nThe second thing he must do is get his executive\nworking as a TEAM. As individuals the present\nexecutive have made some useful contributions to\nIC Union and the Constituent College Unions but\nwe have hardly worked as a team. The purpose of\nan executive is to implement policy as decided by\ngeneral meetings. On this basis the whole of the\nexecutive should have responsibilities to IC Union unhindered by constraints from, say, a particular\nC CU.T his term the height of absurdity was reached when Rosemary Parker, President of RCS Union, was constrained by her own executive from speak-ing, voting or acting as she wished over the grants\ncampaign on a number of occasions, I say absurdity because the actual members of R CSU were at\nleast as much involved as any other C CU( if not\nmore so). But all it needs is a few demagogic, tiny-minded reactionary s*** stirrers on aCC U executive and IC Union Executive's effectiveness is greatly diminished. To achieve any advances for IC\nStudents we need a strong IC Union next year, not\na federation of petty warring factions. Hopefully\nnext year's President will see his task as strengthening his Executive and resisting federalist tendencies. \u2022\nAll the indications are that the next Refectory\nCommittee meeting will be faced with proposals\nfor price rises. Probably \" popular\" meals will go\nup less than others so that pie and beans will be the order of the day for most of us next year. It is\nthe function of neither the Refectory Committee\nnor the Governing Body to do a cover-up job for\nthe Government. Far less is it the function of the\nUnion. The blame for low grants and increased\nprices must be laid on the Government otherwise\nwe can hardly expect either grant increases or sub-si dies. If in spite of our opposition increases are\nimposed then it will be the task of next year's president to lead the fight to get them withdrawn. Early next session the new President will be\ninvolved in negotiations over the level of hall rents\nfor the following year. The government will then\nalso be taking a decision on grants (the triennial\nreview plan), so he will have to renew the campaign and particularly involve fresher s and inform\nthem of the issues at stake.\nThe danger is that if not enough people vote next\nMonday and Tuesday, next year's President and Hon. Sec. will probably not be elected until the\nmiddle of the first term next year. They will be\nfaced with immense problems \u2014 half the dept. reps\nwill have disappeared, the Executive will be doing\ntheir own things, Council will be ticking over in\nvery low gear and the College will have already\ntaken the major decisions which affect us all. Surely, we all have the duty to give our sabbatical officers a fighting chan ec to make this a strong\neffective union! Elect them now \u2014 come to the hustings meeting, listen, question, read the bump h sheets . . but, above all, VOTE ON MONDAY OR TUESDAY!! John Lane\nMARTIN'S BIT\nWelcome back to 3J.C.

We\nshould continue offering\n\"support\" to the other\ncolleges on rent strike,\nand prepare for one in\nautumn, if the DES still\nrefuses to consider the\nclaim.\nFor the summer term\nwe should turn our attention to other tactics.\n\"Work - ins\", \"Crawl -ins\", \"Phone - ins\",\npostgraduate demonstrating stoppages, are\nall useful and generally\nacceptable tactics.

ISSUE No. 334\nMANIFESTOS\nPAGE\n3\nTHE FOURTH TIME OF ASKING Yet another election\nnext week\nNext Monday and Tuesday, you, as a member of Imperial College Union, are entitled to vote in the fourth Presidential election of\nthe current academic year, and the second for the election of next\nyear's President and Secretary.\nThe last election, held in early March, was declared invalid since\nonly 540 people voted, a shortfall of nearly 500 from the necessary\n25 per cent, minimum poll. Candidates for President were Simon All nut and John Herrick, and those for Secretary were Rob Armitage\nand Roy Matthews.\nThis was the culmination of a disastrous year\nfor IC executive elections,\never since Chris Sheppard\nwithdrew from College\nlast June. The first election for his successor in October was a total fiasco,\nwhen 833 out of a total\nof 1100 voters abstained.\nThe second, where John\nLane was elected, was\nshort of the quota of 25\nper cent, but the election\nwas declared valid by aUG M desperate to avoid\nfurther elections.\nPRESIDENT There are three candidates for President.\nROB ARMITAGE stood\nfor President in October\nwould have got in unopposed had Roy Matthews,\nwho was more interested\nin training for Rugby than\ncontesting the elections,\nwithdrawn beforehand\u2014\nhe only announced his intention of doing so after\nthe election. Rob was last\nyear's Rag Chairman, and\nis this year's External\nAffairs Officer. He is also\non the University of Lon don UnionS RC Executive. A third year Physicist, he is a well-known\nfigure in the Union.\nJOCK VE ALL, your local revolutionary party\ncandidate, is an \"un align ed member of the left\"\nwith sympathies directed\ntowards the International\nMarxist Group, led locally by a certain Piers\nCorbyn. Although a hard\nworker for last term's demonstrations and days of\naction, he is probably better known to members of\nthe union as one of the\nprime perpetrators of the\n\"Letters from Heaven\" in last term's issues of FELIX.( His latest offering on\nChurch investment in South Africa appears on\npage 8 of this issue).\nNORMAN SAYLE S you are unlikely to have\nheard of before, unless\nyou are in the Union hier-arch y,in Botany or Zoology, or lived in Holbein\nHouse in1970/72. At pre-Gordon Jackson Jock Ve all Paul Wadsworth\nsent Bot/Zoo rep, he is\npossibly the most interesting candidate for President, since unlike the other\nand previous candidates\nhe has no political connections with the Union nor any affiliation to any\nparty, other than those\nwhich occur at frequent\nintervals in the Union Bar.\nHis organisational qualifications come from being\na leading member of the\nHolbein House Committee, and two years as Bot/\nZoo rep\u2014he was almost\nuncontested for the current year.\nSECRETARY Three candidates again\nfor this post.\nPETER GILLETT stood\nunsuccessfully for Secretary of the NUS at the\nNational Conference in Exeter this Easter, on the\nYoung Socialist Students\nplatform. His outbursts in Union Meetings are fam-o us, and have become\nprogressively more so of\nlate as they have become increasingly co her ent, articulate, to the\npoint, and suffer able. If\nyou agree that we should\nforce the Tories to resign\nand return a Labour government committed to Sosialist policies, this is the\nman for you.\nGORDON JACKSON has\nrocketed (almost literally)\nto fame over the last year\nor so through his handling of the Social Clubs\nCommittee. He became\nSecretary almost at once\nupon joining, and the\nChairmanship followed a mere blink of time later.\nNorman Sayles\nHe has attained a reputation for stealthy efficiency,\nand is a popular figure in the Union.\nPAUL WADSWORTH is\nthis year's Ents Chairman.\nUnder his guidance, Ents\nprofits this year have\nreached all-time heights,\nexceeding \u00a31500, and the\nline-up of groups presented each week has without\ndoubt been the best of any\ncollege in London and one of .the best in Britain.\nHe has a brash commercial attitude, and it would\nbe interesting to see what\nhe would bring to the post\nof Secretary . . . maybe\nconvert the whole of the\nUnion building to a permanent Ents office??\n(the election of the abstentions) and Secretary in the\nlast election\u2014where he\nHe can claim considerable experience from his\nEaster vac job as a dust-\n"

    "content": "May 3rd,1973 FELIX Page 3\nAN IF ES TO S resident\nNORMAN SAYLES\nIT DOES MATTER\nHi, my name is\nNorm, I am standing for\nPresident of IC Union for the coming year. I feel I must begin by ap-o logi sing for not seeming to be a very active\ncandidate for these elections, but as I have\nmy Finals during the\nfirst two weeks of term,\nthese being rather important( I cannot be\nPresident unless I pass!) I am having to\nspend most of my time\non revision.\nThe reason Iam standing is clear to\nthose who know me,\nand I hope will become\nvery clear to the majority of students in IC.\nI am an average student\nand thus feel that I would be a good person\nto represent the college\nin the capacity of President.\nI have now been at\ncollege for three years,\nduring which I have served on Council as Dept.\nrep. from Botany/Zoology for the past two. I was in Student House\nfor my first two years in\ncollege, and was on the\nhouse committee for the\nfinal year. I have been\nin digs and bed-sit this\nyear. Therefore, I have\na good idea of how the\ncollege admin works, and also have a very\ngood understanding of\nhow the normal student\nat IC has to spend His or Her time here.\nDuring the past three\nyears, I have become\ntired of seeing presidents who have been very\nlittle more than an extension of small but\npowerful political\ngroups within the college and the channel\nthrough which they\nhave worked. I have become bored with Union meetings almost every\nweek, and completely\nfed up of seeing the\npolicy of IC being that\nof the Minority, and NOT of the Majority.\nI believe the reason\nwhy most people in college are disinterested\nin the activities of the\nUnion is because of the\nfact that although they\ndisagree with certain\nthings which the Union is doing, they feel that\nthey have not the power\nto make their feelings\nknown. A way of overcoming\nthis particular problem is to have a President,\nand Hon. Sec. who are\nprepared to listen to\nyour ideas rather than\nmerely saying that your\nideas should be put for-ward at a Union meet-ing. In my opinion that\nanswer is not good en-ough. You are now\nthinking \"great, if\nSayles is so bitter on\nthe mechanics of the\nUnion, what does he 'in-tend to do about it?\" I will tell you quite\nsimply in spite of being told that this will never work \u2014 I will always endeavour to be\nfar more approachable\nthan others I have\nknown in places of\nauthority.\nNaturally I have ideas\nfor the future of the\nUnion, the main ones\nbeing: \u2014\n1 I think that we should\nattempt to become\nmore of an autonomous body by completely taking over\nand organising the\nUnion building our-selves. This means\nthat we would be entirely responsible for\nthe Lower refectory,\nincluding the Union bar. There will be opposition of course,\nbut I personally know of several members\nof the college administration who Iam sure would support\nour takeover.\n2 I believe that Imperial\nshould become more\nactive within NUS, I do not mean that we should follow en\nmasse all the proposals of NUS, thereby\ncomplying with their\nevery wish. In fact I mean the exact OPPOSITE. Although I feel that NUS is a useful body of students, I feel that at the mom ent, students throughout the country are\nbeing told what to do\nby the NUS, but surely the situation\nshould be the other\nway around, it should\nbe the students telling the NUS what we\nwant it to do I!! Owing to lack of\nspace, I summarise by saying if anyone wants\nto ask me any questions\nabout the role of President I know very little\nabout it at the moment,\nbut believe that the\nlearning of the job will begin once YOU have\nvoted for me.\nHelp ME to help YOU, Sincerely,\nNORM SAYLE S JOCK VEALL\nThe prime task for a President is to democratically organise students over specific issues which they face\nand not to irresponsibly\nturn away from them\nhoping they might dis-appear.\nTwo of the more important problems which confront us are accommodation and cuts within higher education (i.e. grants).\nACCOMMODATION\nNorthside has not\nbeen built and unless\nwe begin to do something about it, it never\nwill be. (We will keep\npaying the 35p voluntary levy into a fund for\na non-existent hall). An other 1,200 students\nare expected in the\nSouth Kensington area\nby 1976 so the situation\nwill not get better but\nconsiderably worse. It\nis not through paying\nvoluntary levies that we\nsolve our ac com mod ation problems. Any loan\nfinancing scheme at\nbest means money from\nour pockets into the\nhands of big property\nspeculators (are we after a higher grant to pay\nbigger voluntary levies\nto sub sid is e the rich?). Meanwhile for the majority of us who are paying \u00a35, \u00a36, or \u00a37 a week for a place we\nfeel the pinch.\nThanks largely to the\nproperty boom there are\nmore millionaires than\never before in Britain\ntoday. Even in the South\nKensington area the\nproperty developers are\ngetting 2 | million pounds of rate and tax\npayers money as bonus\nfor completion, by the\nend of 1 9 7 3 , of the luxury hotels that only the\nrich can afford to stay\nin.\nHow at I.C. can we\nface up to these problems? We can begin by\nworking with many\nthousands of other\nangry tenants within\nlocal tenants' associa-t ions. At the same time\nICU must help meet the\nimmediate needs of stu-dents, we must start up\norganised squatting and\nwork with various squatting organisations.\nTHE CUTS IN HIGHER\nEDUCATION can already be seen at Imperial College with the\nnon-existence of any\nfuture halls and the introduction of self-fin-anc ing in the refectories\nwith the resulting increase in prices and\ncuts in portions. In\n1 9 6 9 - 7 0 the College\nauthorities were allowed to write off a loss of\n\u00a330,000 on the catering side. It is also noticeable in some of the\nridiculous prices Mooney charges in the\nIC shops. These cuts in\neducation also affect\nthe catering and technical staff, the messen-gers, cleaners, etc.\nwhose wages are kept\ndown; they are also\nsubjected to productivity deals, short time\nwork and redundancies\nto cut costs. What can\nICU do about it? We must organise to fight\nagainst these cuts. The\nmore students involved,\nAs secretary of ICU\nthere can be no better\nchoice than Gordon Jackson. That's my firm\nbelief; that's why Iam proposing him. Since meeting him on Hall Committee I have been impressed\nwith Gordon' s quiet\nefficiency.\nHaving gained social colours for revolution is ing SEA Soc and initiating Cultural Evenings,\nGordon started this year\nwith the strong will( necessary) to chair\nS CC. As in SEA Soc he\nalso doubled as an efficient Secretary. S CC affairs have appeared in\nFelix too.\nPolitically central,\nGordon is not without\nopinion. Reserved in\nnature you will not be\nelecting a bureaucrat \u2014\nNEVERTHELESS HE WILL GET THINGS DONE, quickly and\nquietly.\nJOHN STARES, Mathematics111 The post of Secretary\nof ICU, for me follows\nsome years of organisation of big and small events. With my contacts and a knowledge\nof how to get jobs done,\nacquired while Chairman and Secretary of\nS CC( in 1 year!), Iam confident that I can be\neffective.\nSecretary\nGORDON JACKSO\nMy main role should be speeding up the implementation of Union\nPolicies and keeping\nmembers well in-formed.\nSome of the important areas in which I feel\nthat I can help are: \u2014\n* * Most Union Members have TOTALLY INA D EQUATE KNOWLEDGE of the intricacies of the UNION or\nCOLLEGE WOR KINGS. Hence they often do not become\ninvolved.\nEvidence: The num ber of people who complain about the\nRefectories, but do\nnot try and change\nthem, since they do\nnot know how they\nare run.\n\" \" INSUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR P0ST GRADUATES, WHO COMPRISE ABOUT40 PERCENT OF IC STUDENTS. \u2022 \u2022 GRANTS, where only\ndetermined support\nwill achieve the increases we all desire.\n\u2022 \u2022 EXCESSIVE BUMP H and notices AROUND COLLEGE, many of\nwhich are not read.\nI propose the following ACTION.\n* Give 'open publicity'\nto Union workings.\nTo start the desirable\nflow of information to\nevery Union member,\nI intend to:\n\u2014 Produce a \u00bb ebs of\narticles s xp fai ning clearly how various facets of the\nUnion work.\n\u2014Improve the Blue\nBook Format.\n\u2014Compile directories of useful information on such items as booking\nrooms, obtaining\nprinting in IC, and\nlists of committee\nmembers.\n\u2014 Endeavour to obtain a guide to the\nRefectories.\n* Provide more worthwhile Agenda and better publicity to attract more people to\nUnion Meetings.\n* Give any additional\nhelp required by the\nnewly created (but\nlong overdue) Posfgraduate Affairs Officer.\n* Encourage a rational-is ation of Society\nbump hand Notices.\nI have item is ed some\nproblems and some proposed actions would consider that I had failed in my job if I did not do much more.\nGORDON JACKSON... Chemical Engineering\nPG PAUL WADSWORTH\nThe Hon. Sec. is\nelected by the members\nof Imperial College Un ion to represent their\nviews to numerous bodies and committees\nboth within and outside\nthe Union and the College. I do not, therefore\nintend to state a series\nof promises. Instead, I want to express my personal view as to what direction the thoughts\nof the Union should direct itself next year.\nPARTICIPATION\nMore encouragement\nshould be given to the\nUnion's members to\ntake an active part in\nthe affairs of the Union. For most of the year the\nUnion's General Meetings (at which, acc or ding to the Union Blue\nBook, \" the policy of the\nUnion on important issues is resolved\") have\nbeen either barely qu or ate or, even worse, in-quo rate. For the Union to be really effective\nmore of its members\nneed to take part in this,\nthe most important of\nits activities. This is a Democratic Union. Let\nus direct its efforts towards being more representative of its members. COMMUNICA TION\nLast year's major\ncampaign slogan was\n\" communication\". More could still be done to\nimprove the interchange\nof ideas between the\nUnion's members and\nits Executive. Felix could present more\nmaterial about Union activities. How rh any of\nyou know what decisions have been taken\nat Council this year or\neven at UG M's for that\nmatter? I understand\nthat STOIC will get new\nquarters in the Maths building at present under construction. Surely\nthis would be a good opportunity to widen its\nservices.\nACCOMMODA TION\nAccommodation is\nstill a major headache.\nEven now Northside is\nin danger of not beinn\nbuilt. This hall is vital\nto the needs of we students and we must continue to ensure that it is\nbuilt even if it may be\nsmaller than originally\nplanned.\nFEE\nThe Union fee is\n\u00a38.50 per student. This should be raised, not\nonly to cover the cost of\ninflation but also to enable the Union to expand both existing and new activities.\nThis year sees the\nappointment of the long\nawaited Academic Director. The Union must\nstart to work with him towards more flexible\ncourses with the aim of\nincreasing both the\nchances and the scope\nof jobs available to IC\ngraduates.\nPlease read the\nbump h that I shall put\nout. In it I 'll explain\nthese and other points\nmore fully. I'm available\nin the RATT most dinner tim s s if you wish to\ndiscuss anything. If you\nvote for me. Even if you\ndon't agree, still vote,\nagree with me please\nThis Union cannot afford to have another invalid election.\nThank you.\nPAUL WADSWORTH the closer our ties with then the stronger will action of one form or\nworking people within be our position to fight another to ensure our\ncollege and their Uni back against these cuts, demands don't go un-ons, N UP E and ASTM S, by taking democratic heeded.\n\n"

The race involves transporting Morris Minor, ac comp a an (empty) keg of Tartan\nbeer from Edinburgh to\nLondon, and the various\nclasses of entry are for the\nmost novel way of doing\nthis, the team collecting\nmost money for their nominated charity and for\nthe team completing the\ndistance in the shortest\ntime.\nBoth C& GU and\nR CSU. entered for the\n\"collecting the most for\ncharity\" section and the\nIC team achieved a total\nof about \u00a31,150. R CSU came fourth with \u00a3401.33.\nThe IC team made the\ntrip in a tartan-liveried\nnie d by tartan-clad dolly\nbirds, and collected for\nAction for the Crippled\nChild. R CSU, collection\nfor Imperial Cancer Re search Fund, were considerably less resourceful,\nutilising solely a rented\nminibus driven in a manner which surprised even\nhimself (sounds better than\n\"without due care and at-tent ion\", which is the\ntruth) by a certain Martin C. Black.\nThe Tartan Race was\nentered by teams from\nuniversities and colleges\nthroughout Britain.\nJohn Randall\nelected by\nconference\nas NUS\nPresident\nThe Easter National Conference of the National\nUnion of Students took place at Exeter University on\nApril 2nd6 th. Imperial College Union was represented by five delegates and three observers, viz: Rob\nArrmtage, John Lane, Trevor Phillips, Piers Corbyn,\nSonia Hochfelder, Michael Silverleaf, Peter Gillett\nand Peter Lambert.\nThe Conference elected\nJohn Randall as new president of the NUS, to succeed Digby Jacks in August. John is at present\nthe Deputy President, and\nhis election came as something of a surprise, since\nmost people expected\nMike Terry, NUS Secretary and star of the occasional IC Union Meeting,\nto win. Competition came\nfrom, amongst others,\nPiers Corbyn, who stood\non an IMG-type platform.\nHe came second in the poll\n\u2014 from bottom.\nPeter Gillett, another IC delegate, stood on the\nYoung Socialists ticket for\nNational Secretary. A less-contested battle, he nevertheless lost \u2014 but fared\nbetter than any other YS S candidate in any other\nelection.\nMajor topics discussed\nat the Conference were\nGrants, the White Paper\non Education and Gay Rights. FELIX reporter\nALAS D HAIR CAMPBELL, who attended the\nconference, will be writing\nin depth on it in the next\nissue, out on Tuesday,\n15th May. New Hall\nunlikely to\nbe built\nIt now seems increasingly unlikely that there will be\na new hall built for Imperial College students in the\nforeseeable future. The cost of the planned ten-storey\nNorthside Hall has now risen to a sum of the order of\n\u00a311 millions, as against the original estimate of\n\u00a3500,000.\nThe College is faced\nwith the dilemma of only\nbeing able to raise the original sum \u2014 and even\nthen they would have to\nraise all hall rents to \u00a35\nper week in order to pay\nthe interest charges due to\nthe bank on the money\nthey would have to\nborrow.\nThere are several alternative plans. The most\nfeasible is probably to\nstill build at Northside (on\ntop of the swimming\npool) but to go for seven\ninstead of ten storeys. The\nother main option being\nconsidered by the Student\nResidence Committee is to\nbuild at Harlington, on\nthe College sports ground\n\u2014this would probably be\nlow-rise accommodation\nsimilar to that at Silwood.\nThe main problem here is\nthe one that would be\nfaced by its residents \u2014\nthat is, getting in to South\nKensington. Harlington is\nreasonably near to the\nnew Hatton Cross underground station on the\nPiccadilly line that will\nopen next year, but it's still quite a journey.\nOther alternatives that\nwere discussed at the last\nUnion Executive meeting\nof last term were \"b rid g ing the gap\" between\nPhysics and Aeronautics\nwith a new hall\u2014considered generally to be\nrather impractical \u2014 and\nconversion of 52/53 Prince's Gate and the remainder of Prince's Gardens\ninto a hall when Mathematics, Industrial Sociology and others move out\nin 1975. It was agreed that\nthe latter conversion\nscheme should be carried\nout in any case, subject to\nthe College agreeing to\nfinance the operation.\nUnfortunately it is very\ndifficult to give a true picture of the situation. At present all discussion is\ntaking place within a special sub-committee of\nthe Student Residence\nCommittee, and the\nUnion's representatives on\nthis, Brian Childs (Student\nResidence Officer) and Ian\nMcKenzie are keeping\nquiet about what is happening \u2014 even to the extent of not letting the\npresident of the Union know what is happening.\nThe only certainty is\nthat, if a new hall is built,\nit will be necessary to\nraise the rents of all hall\nrooms in order to pay the\ninterests on the loan.\n\"Praise the\nLord and\npass the\nprofits\"\nThe British Churches,\nas most people know,\nare run on very big business lines. They certainly make money in\nSouth Africa, that most\nChristian of countries.\nThe Prime Minister Belthazar Vorster and his\nbrother Dr. D.J. Vorster, a prominent official\nin the Dutch reformed\nchurch are both devout\nfollowers of Hitler and\nstout Christians.\nIt would clearly be a deplorable thing, how-ever, and against Christian unity, if the South\nAfrican churches were\nthe only ones to make a profit out of the African\nand Indian population.\n(The World Council of\nChurches even donate a few pence conscience\nmoney every year to support African guerillas\nfrom their fat takings\nfrom their investments\nin South Africa).\nThe Church Commission for England have\ncommissioned about 7\nmillion shares in four\ncompanies in South Africa. These are: British\nLeyland Motor Corporation, G.E.C., Metal Box\nand Associated British\nFoods. The market value\nof these shares totals\n\u00a36.5 million. The total\ncurrent value of shares\nPostgrads\nfurious over\ndemonstrating rates\nImperial College postgraduate students, disgusted\nwith the \"rotten deal\" that they are getting from the\ncollege over demonstrating fees, are planning a strong\ncampaign to get a standard \u00a32 an hour rate.\nAt present rates vary\nwildly from department\nto department, and average at about \u00a31 per hour.\nBest off are those in Physics, who are paid \u00a31.40\nan hour \u2014 including preparation time.\nPG's are especially\nangry since the Government declared in 1969 that\nthe average income of a post graduate student from\ndemonstrating fees was\n\u00a3160. They are asking the\ncollege for a minimum of\n\u00a3150 of work for any postgraduate who wishes to do\ndemonstrating. At present\nonly 4 4 % of ICP G's do\nany demonstrating.\nOther universities pay\nmuch more than IC\u2014for\nexample, Oxford and\nCambridge pay as much\nas \u00a33 an hour, and North\nLondon Polytechnic pay\n\u00a32.35.\nThe protest is being led\nby Post-Graduate Affairs\nOfficer Richard Mounce,\nwho is making representations to the Rector. The\nonly reason that strike action is not being contemplated is the lack of\nundergraduates to demonstrate to in the Summer\nTerm \u2014 and a protest of\nthis nature would have to\ncome in the Autumn term.\nhe claims were unconstitutional and in quo rate, is\nnow trying to invalidate\nthese elections on the\nsame grounds. He has so\nfar sent solicitors' letters\nto the incumbent hier-arch y. Further developments are awaited.\nJock\nMcEwan\nnew ULU\npre s. The Assembly of Councils of the University of\nLondon Union met on March19 th, and elected\nJock McEwan by a landslide vote as next year's President. He succeeds\nJoy Clancy. Opponents\nwere Tom Halloren, from\nthe School of Slavonic and\nEast European Studies,\nand Dermont O 'Donnell, a fiery character famed in\nUL U, who comes from\nBirkbeck College.\nJock McEwan is a3rd year Medical student from\nthe Middlesex Hospital,\nand is the first medic to\nhold the post. During the\npast year he has been Secretary of the UL U Student\nRepresentative Council.\nCathy Mortimer, Chairman of UL U Societies'\nCouncil, was elected as\nDeputy President. Her only opponent was once\nagain the redoubtable Mr. O 'Donnell.\nMr. O 'Donnell, who has\npreviously attempted to\nmake much political capital out of the previous set\nof elections, where he was\ndefeated by Joy Clancy\nand Mike Rosier, which\nowned by British Church\norganisations in South\nAfrica's big Corporations is \u00a37.5 million. The\nbig attraction to investment in South Africa is\nthe cheap labour so encouraging fat profits.\nThe average black\nworkman today in South\nAfrica is worse off in\nreal terms than in 1911,\nie, Leyland South Africa,\n11th biggest South Africa company, paid last\nyear on average to its\nunskilled and semiskilled coloured and African labour \u00a37 for a44 hour week. G.E.C., the\nbiggest electrical engineering group in the country pays Africans at the\ngenerous rate of 10.7p per hour or \u00a34.81 for a45 hour week.\nFifteen British church\norganisations have got\ntheir finger in the pie.\nThe Anglican, the Catholic, the Methodist, the\nEvangelist and the\nChurch of Scotland\namongst them.

    "content": "May 3rd,1973 FELIX Page 7\nA Fishy Tale\nSir, of all the topics\nnow occupying the attentions of the media,\nthe Icelandic fishing dispute is very much of a second string to issues\nlike Northern Ireland\nand the Common Market.\nSecond string, that is,\nin Britain.\nIn Iceland the 50 mile\nlimit is regarded as vital\nto the survival of a country that depends\ncompletely on the fish in-dust ry, having no other\nnatural resources or raw\nmaterials, thus no industry it can diversify\ninto. With such serious\nimplications the British\narguments against the\nlimit must be con v inc ing; but are they?\nBritain's opposition to\nthe limit is fourfold.\nFirstly, Britain does\nnot recognise that there\nis a conservation a rgu ment. Secondly, while\nBritain appreciates that\nIceland is economically\ndependent on fish, the\n50 mile limit will have\nserious implications on\nthe British fish industry.\nThirdly, Britain contends\nthat Iceland is in defiance of International\nLaw. Finally the 50 mile\nlimit does not recognize\nthe traditional rights of\nBritish fishermen to fish\nIcelandic waters.\nIceland states that\nthere is a conservation\nargument. In 1971 the\ndeath rate of cod in Icelandic waters amounted\nt0\\70% of all mature cod\nand 50% of immature\ncod, of which 80% was\ndue to the fishing effort.\nAlso cod older than 10\nyears in the catch are\nrare, whereas 15-20\nyears ago 15 year old\nfish were abundant. This\nmeans that fishing is\nbased on younger and\nyounger fish, so the\nspawning potential of the\nfish stocks is seriously\nthreatened. Twenty years\nago, cod spawned, on\naverage, twice a year at\nleast. Now, on average,\nit is only once. The implications are obvious.\nEconomically, Brit ain's dependence on fish\namounts to approximately 0.2% of total,\nemploying approximately\n0.5% of the population.\nThe figures for Iceland\nare 81% and 20% re-spec t iv ely. The catch\nfrom Icelandic waters,\nin 1971, amounted to\nless than 12% of the total catch. A50% reduction of fishing effort\nwould mean only a6% drop in catch, assuming\nthe fishing boats not\nused in Icelandic waters\nwere not used else-where. To imply, also,\nthat the British fishing industry cannot make up\nthe deficit on the seventeen or so other fishing\ngrounds used, casts aspersions on the skills of\nBritish fishermen.\nIceland is not breaking any existing international law by imposing\nthe 50 mile limit. The\nU.N. General Assembly,\nin 1972, passed a resolution recognising the\nrights of states to permanent sovereignty over\nsuper j a cent waters. Two\nJudges involved in The\nInterim Order, Padilla\nNervo and Mr. G.G. Fitzmaurice, both state\nthat the 50 mile limit is\nnot contrary to International Law. It is not\na question of Iceland\nbreaking the law, more a question of Britain misinterpreting the law. Alternatively, as Iceland is\nbreaking no law, Britain,\nby ignoring the laws of\nan independent sovereign state, is the only\nlaw breaker.\n'Traditional rights' is\nthe last argument Britain puts forward. We\nhave fished Icelandic\nwaters for 300 years.\nThree hundred years ago\nthe fishing limit around\nIceland was 32 miles.\nRecognition of the 'traditional rights' argument\nis recognition of an extensive fishing limit.\nA Iso when do 'traditional\nrights' come before the\nsurvival of a nation?\nThis then, is a summary of the British and\nIcelandic case. We welcome the views of the\nStudent body and would\nlike to hear from anyone who accepts the Icelandic case. Further information can be supplied to interested par-ties. We would urge all\nthose who agree with us\nto write to their M.P.'s, the national press, anyone who could help in\ngetting this issue into\nthe public eye.\nOnly by open pu oli c discussion will the British argument be revealed for what it is; self-centred, shallow and in-defensible.\nYours faithfully,\nFRIENDS OF ICELAND\nDerek Smith and\nDavid Jarvis\nPOETRY CORNER\nSOUTHERN FINNISH SUMMER NIGHTS\nLightless ray\nIn darkness bright.\nNightless day\nIn day less night.\nNights' no name\nFor summer light.\nDaydreams tame\nThe lying night.\nSun below\nAnd gulls in flight;\nSkyline glow Of lifeless light.\nLand bound sun And day bound night;\nMidnight' s none\nAnd black is White.\nRight is wrong And wrong is right;\nDay is song\nAnd music night.\nNight is none\nWhen dusk is dawn, Summer's fun When sleep's a yawn.
