The ships\nthat take London's sewage\ndown river to the estuary\nwhere it is dumped in the\nsea. The consequence of\nthis is that the \u00a335 million\nthat the GLC has already\nspent on de polluting the\nThames has all gone to\nwaste. The fish shoals\nwhich have been introduced into the Thames so that\nby 1980 we should be able\nto reap the benefits from\nthis long term planning\nwill nearly all have been\nkilled. The long term effects on the Thames is in-estimable. As a result of\nthis action by the GLC, millions of tons of sewage\nis being pumped into the\nThames, where it grossly\npollutes the river\u2014or is\nbeing stored in 'lagoons\"\nnear big housing estates in\nBecton and Thamesmead\nwhere it is becoming a very unpleasant health\nhazard. The councillors\nhave even pretended the\nsewage is non-toxic\" . . .\nthe tenants in Becton and\nThamesmead think other-wise.\nThe dispute started\nwhen the sludge boat men\nwere offered a new contract which imposes on\nthem the clauses of the\nnew Merchant Shipping\nAct under which the Ma ster of the ship can fine the\nmen on the spot up to \u00a350\nor suspend or dismiss\nthem for anything he\nthinks to be amis demean our. (The crew of the\ncruise liner, 'Ocean Mon arch' were each fined \u00a350\nby the master last week\nwhen they walked out in\nprotest over dirty living\nquarters). Unless the men\nagree to these clauses they\nwon't be allowed to take\nthe sludge out to sea.\nThe GLC has several\ncouncillors who wish to\n'hive off' the service to private enterprise, and there\nis already one subcontractor standing by ready to\nship the sludge out to sea\nat the rate of 50p per ton\n(at present it costs 15p). The subcontractors are- a sand and gravel firm who\nplan to bring back sand\nand gravel from the sea\nbed on the return journey . . . so they hope to\nmake a real killing. Several GLC councillors, it ap-pears, have shareholding\nin this firm and have\nthus a vested interest in ensuring that this private\ncontractor get the con-tract.\nThe convenor of the\nshop stewards has challenged the GLC Establishments Officer to a public\ndebate but to date the latter has not taken up this\noffer.\nJOCK VE ALL. As a so called member of' God soc',I feel I must reply to Mr. Campbell's poem in last week's FELIX. Mr. Campbell seems to suggest that Christianity is for people who can't come to terms with reality, and I would dispute that most strongly. One only needs to look at the hoards emerging out of Southside and the Union bars at midnight, to realise that for a lot of people life can only become a reality in an alcoholic haze. For others reality comes through drug trips, and sadly for some with an overdose of sleeping tablets. Have these people found reality? IC has its fair proportion of revolutionaries, one only needs togo to Union meetings to realise that, and yet the greatest revolutionary of all time is largely ignored; Marx, Stalin, Castro, Guevara, etc., attempted to change social structures, Jesus Christ changes people. Christ produced the only answer to the problems that confront everyone of us \u2014\nhis voluntary death on the cross for our sins. If we accept that death, Jesus Christ becomes a living reality. He has atl the answers to life's problems. Jesus said:\" I have come that you may have life, and life in all its fullness\". I pray that Mr. Campbell will come to realise that Christians, far from opting out of reality, present in the person of Jesus Christ, the only true answer to living a life of reality \u2014 the reality of a per-son al relationship with Jesus. Yours in Christ, DAVID HUMPHREY S Chairman of Methodist Society. Sir,I would like to debunk the attitude of the lunatic Left\nthat students\" are workers, too, as you will find when you are employed, and fight-ing for that first pay increase.\" In the five years between my first degree and return to postgraduate study, I received no less than ten salary increases. Not one of these I asked, demanded, struggled, or fought for. In three plus years at my first job,s even separate rises boosted my pay from \u00a3 1 , 5 0 0\nto \u00a3 3 , 1 0 0 . After changing jobs, a further three in eleven months took it to \u00a3 4 , 7 5 0 . A few months later, I quit. Ido not believe my case unusual; most employers have salary reviews periodically \u2014 every six months or so. If you merit am increase, you get it; you need neither ask, demand, struggle, nor fight.\nSincerely, JAMES H. FENNER. Meteorology P.G. ARMITAGE\nThe Spring Term statutory meeting of the University of London Union took place on Saturday at Chet sea College, and there were six hours of animated debate. Imperial College Union was represented by Rob Armitage, External Affairs Officer, who got himself elected on to the S RC Executive. The main topics of discussion were the Government's White Paper,\" Education: A framework for expansion\", the Grants Campaign and the setting up of a London Student Organisation. The major topic was the White Paper. A motion, proposed by Queen Elizabeth College in the form of Dave Emmett( also Chairman of\nthe S RC), attempted to set downS RC policy on all aspects of the White Paper; Nursery Education, Schools, In service training for Teachers, Higher and Further Education and the Diploma of Higher Education. Rob Armitage proposed four amendments, three of which were accepted; but the fourth, deploring the government's increase in defence expenditure at the sametime as cutting back education, was defeated. The motion especially deplored the\" Proposed decrease of20% in the education budget, from6.5% to5.0% of the Gross National Product.\" It also deplored the cutback of80,000 on projected figures for numbers MORE ON\nStudents at Stirling\nvoted at a meeting of the\nStudent Council to boycott\nthe University trials. They\nwill not be represented in\nany way at the hearings,\nand students witnesses\nhave refused to attend.\nThey have done this because they feel that it was\nEXECUTED\nof students in Higher Education and rejected the Dip H.E. as it stands. An amendment to remove a section of the motion affirming S RC's belief in the state run comprehensive system as the only fair system of education was, surprisingly, only narrowly defeated, various speakers extolling the virtues of private education and the two tier state system. Discussion on the proposed London Student Organisation was hampered by dissatisfaction and in comprehension of a flowchart indicating the suggested structure of the organisation.S RC did, however, accept the need for such an organisation and agreed to give it\ntheir support. John Wilson, VicePresident of NUS for Education, addressed the meeting on the subject of tomorrow's regional demonstration. Mistaking the meeting for a rather depleted Chelsea U GM, he went into all the tri vili a i ties, but stressed the importance of a good turnout in London if theN US Executive's negotiations with the DES next week are to be fruitful. Spurred on by what they described to a FELIX reporter as \" a manic desire to get home in time for\" Dr. Who\", the Executive rolled through the minor business in record time to finish the six hour marathon by5 p.m. STIRLING\nimpossible to get a fair\nhearing, for the reasons\nmentioned in i the last\narticle.

    "content": "February 20th,1973 FELIX Page 7\nTHE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS\nThe Significance of Population Growth In my last article I said that the root cause\nof the environmental\ncrisis was that industrial\ncivilisation has adopted\nan ideal, that of non-stop\neconomic growth, which\nhas now become unworkable owing to the\nmaterial limitations\nplaced upon us by the\nplanet on which we live.\nHowever, while resource\nshortages and pollution\nproblems will be the\nfactors which most directly affect the developed countries of the\nworld, the poorer nations will find that a third problem, that of\npopulation growth, will\nin most cases be their\nmajor headache. This is\nbecause their populations are growing much\nmore quickly than those\nof the developed co un tries. The population\n\"doubling - times\" of\nmost 'developing' countries are now about 20-35 years, whilst for the\ndeveloped countries they\nare in the region of 60-100 years. That means\nthat a country such as\nKenya with a doubling-time of 23 years, has, in\nthis short period, to\ndouble its food-pro duc tion, its housing, its\nschools, hospitals, roads\nand all its other amenities and necessities\nMERELY IN ORDER TO PREVENT ITS PEOPLE'S STANDARDS OF LIVING\nFROM DETERIORATING.\nAs far as food is con-cern ed, an idea which seems to have gained\npopularity lately is that\nthe 'green revolution'\nhas solved all the\nworld's problems for the\nforeseeable future. Nothing could be further from\nthe truth. All it does is to\nallow a short breathing\nspace in the struggle to\nfeed the world's growing population. If use is\nnot made of this to red u ce the rate of growth\nby a significant amount,\nwe will merely find ourselves confronted in a short while with the\nsame problem on a larger scale.\nThe limitations of the\ngreen revolution fall into\ntwo classes, the ' human' and the 'material'. The latter stem from the\nsimple fact that you can't produce extra food\nout of nothing! In order\nto achieve the high\nyields obtainable from\nthe new strains of wheat\nand rice, the plants\nmust have plenty of\nwater and a liberal dose\nof fertiliser. Thus unless\npolitical and economic circumstances allow a good supply of the latter\nand provision of a good\nsupply of the former (un-less irrigation can be\nused) advantages of\ngrowing 'super - wheat'\nare nil. The only difference between crop-fail-ure with the ordinary\ngrain varieties and with\nthe 'super' varieties is\nthat in the latter case\nmore people are likely to\nstarve as a result. Real\nbenefit can only be obtained from the green\nrevolution if the necessary proportions of the\nincrease in yield is\nstockpiled for use in a year when the crop fails.\nGrave economic and human problems also arise as a result of the\ngreen revolution. These\nmostly stem from the\nfact that growing a crop\nof 'super-wheat' requires\na higher initial investment than for ordinary\nwheat, partly because\nthe seed is more expensive and partly because\nof the cost of the fertiliser. Hence those who are rich enough to make\nthe investment (or obtain\na bank loan) can make\ngood use of the new varieties, whilst the\npoorer people can often\nfind themselves worse\noff than they were be-fore, if they rely on selling part of their crop to\npay for their other necessities. Other problems\ncan occur as a result of\nthe higher price of the\nseed for the new strains;\nfor example, adulteration of the seed with that\nof ordinary varieties by\ncorrupt merchants or\ngovernment officials. It\nis all very well for the\ncomfortable, well - fed\nscientists of the industrial world to sit in their\nlaboratories and 'solve'\nthe problems of the developing countries. Too often, however, they totally fail to comprehend\nwhat their so-called 'sol-ut ions' actually mean in\nhuman terms.\nIt is frequently pointed out that we would go\na long way towards solving the problem of starvation just by distributing more equally the\nfood which we already\nhave. While this may be\ntrue at present, there\nare several limitations to\nthis approach. Firstly,\nthe greater the distance\nover which the food has\nto be transported, the\ngreater the quantity of\nresources which are\nused up in the process.\nSecondly, where food is\ntransported across national boundaries, political problems are liable\nto arise. Do we really,\nfor example, want to see\na situation in which many of the poorer\npeoples of the world have to depend heavily\non food from North Am erica merely to stay\nalive? Thirdly, it seems\nlikely that the part that\nredistribution can play\nin solving the food problem will diminish rapidly\nin the longer term. It has\nbeen estimated that if all\nthe countries of the developed world lower\ntheir birth rates to replacement level by the\nyear 2 0 0 0 and all the\nother countries by 2 0 4 0 ,\nthen the world population will eventually stabilise at some 151 thousand million people, over\nfour times its present\nsize! Producing food for\neven half that number\nwill be incredibly diff i cult. The only rational\nsolution to the problem\nseems to be to stabilise\nthe world's population\nas fast as possible. If we don't take steps to do this ourselves then na ture will simply do it for\nus.\nThe most worrying aspect of the population\nproblem is perhaps the\nquestion of how much a decrease in the rate of\npopulation growth is inevitably tied to a corresponding increase in the\nmaterial standard of liv-ing. We know that countries can go through the\nso-called 'demographic\ntransition' (i.e. achieve a significant and permanent fall in the birth rate)\nwithout having any particularly advanced birth-control techniques. This\nhappened in Britain between about 1 8 7 0 and1930. In such cases the\ndecrease in birth-rate\nhas gone hand in hand\nwith the process of industrialisation and the\nrise in the standard of\nliving. What does not\nseem to be clear, how-ever, is whether a simi lar transition can be\nbrought about merely by\nmaking available sophisticated family-planning\nmethods but without a concomitant improvement in material welfare.\nIt seems very unlikely\nthat it can be, unless coercive measures are resorted to, and who precisely is going to claim the right to tell other\npeople how many child ren they can have?\nThus .the population\nproblem concerns not\nonly the under v eloped countries but the developed ones as well, for\nit is the latter who by\ntheir excessive material\ngreed and profligate\nwastage of resources are\nmaking it much more\ndifficult for the former to\nachieve one of the requirements for st a bilis ing their populations (ie\ndevelopment). Therefore, perhaps the main\nway in which the developed countries can help\nsolve the population\nproblem is to decrease\ntheir usage of resources\nand make more available\nto the rest of the world. One of the ways in\nwhich they can help do this is by s tabi lising, or\neven reducing, their own\npopulations. While this\nwill hardly be enough on its own, as I hope I made\nclear in my last article, it\nis certainly one of the\nthings which should be\ndone and it is also a measure which, in Britain at least, is likely to\nbe politically more acceptable in the short\nterm than, say, reducing\nthe per-capita use of re-sources.\nMIKE ROBSON\n(Chem.P.G.) On the workings of\nRefectories and\nMr. Mooney's Mind\nTHE COMMITTEE How is the Refectory\nCommittee constituted?\nSee green Blue Book pp149151. Thanks Martin.\nWhat does it do?\nft deliberates on all matters affecting the refectories and bars (run for the\nbenefit of members of the\ncolleges and members of\nthe Union), although its\nsub - committees largely\nhandle Complaints, Fin ance, Refectory bookings,\nBars and the college cel-lars. The Refectory Committee is responsible to\nthe Governing Body.\nA recent matter of great\nimportance is hygiene \u2014\ndealing with cockroaches\nand mice pie. f personally\nthink College has, by student bureaucrat standards\nat least, been incredibly\nslow in dealing with this\nproblem. But a fairly rigorous procedure for cleaning and pest control seems\nto have been finally adopted\u2014although not yet officially by the Refectory\nCommittee, we shall find\nout at the the next meet-ing. (Of interest here was\na recent story in the Evening News, relating to a fine\non some establishment for\nfailing to maintain a sufficient standard of hygiene:\nthe proprietor of a similar\nestablishment in the same\nstreet was quoted as saying\nthat infestation was not\nan insuperable problem.\nThe reason \u2014 'I keep my place clean'.)\nPRICES AND POLICY That wholesale prices of\nfood have risen is not un-known. But the following\nfigures might surprise you.\n% in Sep Feb crease\nBeef 38p49p28( lb)\nLamb22 p26p22 Pork 26p33p24 Potatoes 60p75p20(4c wt) Frozen\npeas .069p.075p10( per\npea?)\nThe wage bill rose from\n\u00a331,043 in the 5 months\nto 26/12/71 to \u00a345,726 for\nthe same period in1972. The basic rate has risen by\n12^%, the rest of the increase being from the employment of more staff in\nCollege Block (with a resultant larger turnover:\nhow about trying that in the Union Refectory?) and\nincrease management expenses (e.g. last year the\npost of Deputy Manager\nwas vacant for a considerable time with consequent saving). So it is seen\nthat food prices have risen\ntwice as much as wages.\nNow, it is Government\npolicy that catering should\nbe self-balancing, i.e. run\non a break-even basis.\nWith the exception of public holidays, the refectories\nare run all the year round,\nand the trading position\nvaries with time. Briefly,\nthe peak trading is October (on arrival of the\nfreshmen) is the main in put of profit to counteract\nthe losses made in the\nvacations and the summer\nterm.\nWhen prices were in creased in October by2 \u00a3\"/o( the grant went up by\na Whole 3%) it was\nthought that this would be\na sufficient increase to\nbreak even this year. Ho wever the current rate of inflation was not foreseen.\nSo, even if wholesale\nprices remain at their present level, the Refectories\nwill lose in the region of\n\u00a39,000 this financial year.\nTHE PROPOSED PRICE INCREASE Several things could be\ndone about this:\n1. Part of the loss could\nbe met from reserves (the\ntotal reserves are not large\nenough to cover the loss).\n2. The bar profits (difficult\nto estimate because of the\neffects of VAT) could be\nused to offset part of the\nloss instead of refurnishing Southside Bar.\n3. The entire profits of\nthe College Cellar might\noffset some of the loss.\n4. Prices could go up \u2014\nMr. Mooney proposed a25% increase in the main\ncourse charges, 2 0 % on\nchips and lp on vegetable\nservings. ( NB it is Mr. Mooney's duty as Catering\nManager to table this pro-pos al. Don't blame him \u2014\nto do so is only side-track-ing the issue).\nWhat will be done? 2\nand 3 are against both college and Union policy.\nThe Union reps will certainly fight any such pro-pos als, and such proposals\nare extremely unlikely.\nI. Will have to be used in\npart.\n4. This is the interesting\nbit.\nMr. Mooney wrote to\nthe Ministry regarding the\neffects of the 'price\nfreeze' on the proposed\nincreases. A copy of the\nreply is printed here. Now tell me that Phase 2 is not\na wage freeze. Does line 6\nof the text mean you can't raise net profits, or percentage profits? Very in-te resting. THE EFFECT ON STUDENTS Firstly, I believe prices\nare unlikely to be in creased. Secondly, there is\na much broader, and I think quite clear, con clu sion.\nTwo years ago the NUS went to the (Conservative)\ngovernment asking for\nmajor changes in the structure (and amount) of\ngrants. The Government\nrefused to discuss the\nmajor demands, whilst the\ntoken concessions they\nmade have been described\nby the CVC P as 'com-p let ely inadequate.' The Government, however,\nsaid that Universities\nshould keep down the cost\nof accommodation and\nmeals. However, the college have orders from the\nGovernment to make accommodation and re fec tories, self-financing, and\nare bound to do so. Vac ation letting has allowed\nImperials' authorities to\nkeep accommodation charges reasonably low, but\nthere is no comparable in come for refectories.\nOn one hand the University states \" We know\nstudents are in difficulty\nbut this can only be solved\nby the Government giving\nlarger grants\". On the\nother hand the government\nstates \"Grants would be\nquite adequate if Universities kept their prices\ndown\". Both agree there\nis something wrong but\nneither side will accept the\nultimate responsibility for\nthe students squeezed in the middle.\nACTION We therefore must\nchoose either to take some\naction or become poorer\nfrom year to year \u2014 or month to month. On the\nquestion specifically of re-fec tories, I believe that Mr. Mooney has been invited\nto the next U GM( which is\nan hour before the next\nRefectory Committee\nmeeting). Bring questions\nand ideas.\nAnd see you on tom or row's demo.\nRob Armitage\n(Mr. Armitage is one of\nthe 5 Union reps on the\nRefec. Cttee.

Swailes\nSails flapping, Fanny lay rolling in a trough. Ferocious extricated himself from under the Twig worm, and tried to think of something to do.\" The anchor!\" he thought. Clambering on to the deck, he made his way to the front of the boat, and looked for the anchor. There it lay, tied to the deck with some little bits of string. With water sluicing over his hands and shooting up his sleeves, Ferocious untied the string and lifted the anchor from the deck. With a short prayer that he was doing the right thing, he flung it over the side.\nThere was a rumble and a roar, as the chain rushed out, whisking Ferocious' legs away from under him. Yards and yards of chain disappeared over the side and down into the water. It occurred to a bruised Ferocious that the end of the chain might not be attached to the boat.\nHe hoped he was wrong. Luckily, he was, and the chain stopped running out with a jerk, and a cloud of damp rust. They still seemed to be drifting along, but at\nleast all that chain was holding them head to wind. Suddenly a shock ran through the old boat \u2014 they had been carried into shallow water and the anchor had bitten. The anchor chain sprang into the air, and strummed like a violin string. It seemed impossible that nothing would break under the tremendous strain, but everything held, and the Fanny came to reston her anchor.\" Not half bad,\" thought Ferocious, and looked around the craft. Obviously the next job was to get the remaining sails down. He called aft to Phosphorous to come and help, and together they managed to lower the mizzen and the ji b.\"Right,\" said a fully recovered Ferocious D in,\" now to deal with George.\" The two friends returned to the cockpit to find the Twig worm anxiously bending over the prostrate figure of the captain.\" Oh, dear,\" cried the Twig.\" I don't know what' s the matter with him, he just keeps muttering.\" True enough, poor George seemed to be unconscious, but all the time he kept muttering, a string of words and phrases that made absolutely no sense whatever.\" Tiny rubber bananas,\" muttered George confidentially,\" over intensive agriculture vagrancy sidewalks in the country, felling list to port in a storm bound...\" smilingly he rambled on.\" What do you think we should do?\" asked Phosphorous.\" Let's get him inside,\" said Ferocious. Carefully they carried George down the companionway, and laid him, still muttering, on his bunk.\" We must send for some, as it were, medical assistance,\" said Ferocious importantly,\" there must be some sort of communications equipment onboard\". The three survivors searched the cabin for a radio, or even a hooter. They found nothing. Suddenly Phosphorous gave a shou t.\"Here,\" he said,\" this could be it.\"\" Tarmac adam and eve,\" said George helpfully. Phosphorous held up a little box with holes drilled in the top. Written on one side were the words\" Foe tid Message s\".\"How strange, not to say macabre,\" commented Ferocious,\" open it then, dear boy, don't keep us in suspense.\" His handshaking slightly, Phosphorous lifted the lid.\" You rang, Sir?\" said a deep voice from within. Phosphorous recoiled and nearly dropped the box.\" Oh, give i there, old son.\" said Ferocious, impatiently. He took the box from Phosphorous' trembling fingers and looked inside. A tiny bat stood in one corner of the box. It bowed from the waist, and said,\" Good evening, Sir.I am Foe tid the ship's communications system. If I can be of any assistance to you, Sir, you have only to ask.\" Ferocious was momentarily at a loss for words, but not for long.\" Well, tiny leathery creature, it is like this,\" he said,\" George has been struck down with a strange muttering disease, and we cannot really sail the boat without him. So we need to summon help of a medical nature, as you might have it.\" Once again the little winged weir die inclined its head,\" Might I suggest, Sir, that I summon the assistance that you require? I can fly to any destination within fifty miles, and return.\"\" Splendid\" said Ferocious,\" off you go\nthen and find usa doctor for poor old George.\"\" Certainly, Sir,\" said Foe tid, and flapping\nhis crinkled wings he flew straight out of the door and away over the storm tossed waters.\" Bit like Noah, really,\" said Ferocious. Night was fast approaching, and the intrepid trio made themselves as comfortable as possible, to try and get some sleep.\nIt was not easy, as the boat still rose and fell on the rollers, and George's muttering was too loud to be ignored. Finally the three fell into a fitful land dreamless sleep. Phosphorous was the first to wake. George was still muttering away on his bunk, and Phosphorous went over to peer at the patient.\" Ostriches C roes us,\" said George by way of greeting.\" Morning George,\" said Phosphorous. The captain seemed neither better nor worse. It was then that Phosphorous noticed that the boat was no longer rolling and tossing all over the place. In fact he could stand up without having to hold on to any-thing. He made his way out on to the deck. The air had that six a.m. feel about it, cold and fresh, a weak sun spilling over the sea. The latter was as flat as the proverbial mill pond, just a tiny ripple running here and there to break the mirror surface. Phosphorous was impressed, and stood for along moment looking out over the water, thinking that perhaps this boating had something to it after all. His dreaming was interrupted by the arrival of Ferocious D in.\" Morning, dear boy,\" he said gloomily,\" a trifle nippy about the kneecaps, is it not?\"\" I had n't really noticed,\" said Phosphorous, a little annoyed at having his moment of solitude disturbed.\" That, dear lad, is because you are well clad in a layer of fat which Ido not p.ss ess. More' s the pity at time s.\"\"Um,\" said Phosphorous,\" perhaps you' rer lj ht.\"\" Dear lad,\" replied the un squash able Ferocious,\" Iam almost always right, but don't let it disturb you. I propose to concoct some breakfast. Will you join me?\"\"In a moment,\" said Phosphorous. Ferocious disappeared below, leaving his friend to a few more minutes staring sadly out over the leaden sea, now tinged with copp er as the sun rose higher.

Usually, I give\nMooney a wide berth and Southside\na desert. Like many others, I operate\na personal Mooney boycott which\ntakes me to the RCA, or Harrods staff\nrestaurant or even the Hot Pot at\nEarl's Court. At all of these the taste-buds can emerge well-satiated at a price wholly competitive to Chez M's eating houses.\nOccasionally, when time is short,\nI eat in the Union but on this day circumstances took me to Southside.\nUnfortunately the S.U. was not operating a boycott to dissuade me from\nrecklessness and I was swept inside\nby the mixed aroma of vinegar and\nthe cashier's profuse adornment of\nstale perfume. Any satisfaction to be\nafforded by a Mooney meal is likely\nto come from quantity rather than\nquality though the one is prone to\nusurp the other to such an extent that\nmost of any lavish portion is dumped\non the clearing table as the hasty retreat is made. I arrived at the head\nof the queue full of optimism . . .\n\"Pork, please.\"\nThe woman serving the spuds was the one in the blue suit, the boss-woman. She seems to have more\nhands than Eric Sykes but tends to\ndisappear up her own. I wish Victor\nwould teach her to smile. The guy in\nfront of me asks for roast potatoes.\nRoast potatoes! That's a joke. He gets\ntwo small ones. They bear a remarkable resemblance to greasy dumplings squeezed into a pair of con-dom s. \"Chips, please.\"\nI get about a third of a typical chip-shop portion.\n\"Can I have some more chips,\nplease?\"\n\"That's a portion\"s he says, glaring at me sexless ly.I arrest the bulge within my trou-ser s,\"it's a vary small one,'' I say.\nI decide to become what is called\npetulant in such circumstances and refuse to accept this grotesque black\nob'ect which comprises about 10 per\ncent of my chips. She replaces it with\none other. Unhappily she unearths\nmany other rank, black specimens on\nmy plate taking the one off. These\ncomprise about 5 0 per cent of my\ndam i po.t 'on and I proceed to take\nthem off, one by one. She becomes what is called petulant in such circumstances and snatches the plate\nback. It is returned with the offending matter removed and replaced. I masochistic ally accept a potion of\nphosphorescent green beans, hand\nover 22 pence, eat the meal and leave. I am still hungry. The pork was quite nice.\n. . . AND REFECTORY\nBOYCOTTS\nStudent politics is a bit of a game,\nreally. New issues crop up each year,\nonly to be replaced by other, more\nfashionable confrontations the follow-ing. Double punishment and common\nrooms have been and gone and o th ers, NUS membership, for example,\nget resurrected every few years when\nthere is nothing else of special interest raising its ugly head. This continual change of direction is mainly\ndue to the annual turnover of Union\nofficers and the radical alteration in\npolicy which often ensues. The college administration, however, doesn't change very much at all. Many college negotiators have been sitting on\ntheir committees for years. Some for\nmany years. Many for too many years.\nWhat these many years have taught\nthem is the art of diplomacy \u2014 or, in\ncruder terms \u2014 tactical bullshit.\nIf you write critical letters from one\ncompany to another, say, very often\nthe reply you receive will not answer\nmany, if any, of the points you raised;\nit may well appear to reply to a completely different letter. This non-committal, procrastinating disease is\nvirulent in any sort of political confrontation and is a very effective weapon against the enthusing but tactically naive student. Often non-de-c is ions are calculating ly delayed until the summer vac. when they are\nquietly forgotten under a mounting\nblanket of dust. For others an abrupt\nnegative, weeks after the summer\nterm has ended when no-one is around to put up much of a fight.\nThe prophylactic for this sort of opposition is to concentrate on central,\nperennial issues and to organise a very effective campaign. Two obviously recurrent subjects, always of\nimmediate concern to students, are\ngrants and refectories and it appears\nstrange that tactics adopted by I.C. Union are an attack on the second\non behalf of a campaign to increase\nthe first. Strange, maybe, but then\ngrant money is used to buy food and\nthe less the cost of the food, the\ngreater the actual worth of the grant.\nIn the opinion of many, I.C. refectory\nfood is both expensive and lousy (rel-at ive to comparable places) and any\nboycott specifically to improve the refectories would be justified.\nMooney, who is now talking in\nterms of a25 per cent increase in\nrefectory costs and has instructed his\nstaff to give smaller portions may well\nbe in eff i cent but this can only be\nshown by an examination of the ac-counts. If it is so, internal changes\nmust be demanded. The current boycott however, is not concerned with\nthe efficiency of the catering at IC,\nbut is st II relevant to refectories because the system of Un:\nvers it y financing (which includes the provision of\ngrants) demands that they should be\nself-fin anc 'ng. A refectory boycott has\nbeen held before when South s de was\ninfested with cockroaches and it\nb ought rapid improvements after\nIVtooney's in't 'al tantrum when he\nsent all the staff home so no supper\nwas served. The current boycott is\nunlikely to achieve such swift results\nprimarily because its aims are not so\ncle a ly and locally defined.\nOne of its chef aims should be to\nget the college, in the shape of the\nrector, to pub lc ly declare support for\nthe grant campaign. He has expense d sympathy for the students' plight privately so why not a public statement?\nPerhaps Penney's delaying that one\nuntil he ceases to be rector at all.\nMARTIN DOUGHTY "

If you know about the Titanic and the Marie Celeste, then nothing that\nGeoffrey Jenkins says about the\n' War at ah' will be very surprising. His story follows the traditional line, the\nyear is 1 9 0 9 and the crack ' Blue Anchor' liner the War at ah sinks with out trace or survivors off the coast of\nSouth Africa. When in 1 9 6 7 the\nGemsbok, a Viscount Airliner of\nSouth African Airways disappears in\nexactly the same place, then the mystery starts to become complicated. The characters are weak, and their\nactions and emotions predictable;\nhowever, luckily for the author, the story moves quickly and he becomes engrossed in the descriptions of the\nstorms at sea. The story of the War at ah's disappearance is a true one (only the facts\nhave been changed to fit the book)\nand one where there is still consider able doubt and mystery surrounding the disappearance of this modern' safe' liner. Recently this controversy\nwas reopened in the correspondence columns of the Times. Was it the\nextra deck built on at the last minute\nthat made her top heavy and caused her to capsize or was it the coal bun-ke redon her decks for the long voy-age, or perhaps it was in the freak\nseas experienced by the British C rui ser HMS Bir aug ham during the second worldwar off the Por do land coast\nthat the true solution lies?\nDown with Skool! by Geoffrey Williams and Ronald Searle. Armada Lion, 2 0 p. Do you have haunting memories of school, did you keep dragon fi ies in\n\" Sir's\" desk or was it you that spotlighted the stagehand tiptoeing across the set while the heroine sobbed in\ndarkness? Even if you did none of\nthese things, then you must surely\nremember those sadistic teachers that\ntweaked your ears and shaved your\nhead with a ruler. ' Down with Skool' brings it all back in a delightfully\ngood humour ed way... well worth looking at.\nMY FAT FRIEND Jennie Linden is the 29-year-old\nFat Friend. For the past 6 years, since\nher father died, she' shada rather\neffeminate boarder, Henry (Kenneth\nWilliams). Last year she took in an other. James, an18 year-old Scot, a naive, burly bookworm who has just\nfinished his first novel. He' s also the\nhouse cook.\nFat these past dozen years, it's only after meeting Tom in her bookshop that she embarks on a reducing plan. His work has taken him East for\nfour months; she will surprise him upon his return at Christmas. The first act is filled with Henry' s funny, though often snide, remarks on her rotund figure. His cajoling is instrumental in keeping her will power\nup. He has the best comic lines in London, while James' are naively\nwitty.\nThe second act changes timbre.\nAlthough still comedy, there'san edge of drama as she copes with losing three stone. James is upset, as he liked her better (or at least as well)\n\" THE REAL INSPECTOR HOUND\" AND\" AFTER MA GRIT TE\"( SHAW) Four years a goI attended, very\nmuch against my better judgment, a play by a fellow called Tom Stoppard. I had not heard of him, and the name\nof the play \" The Real Inspector\nHound\"' hardly seemed inspired\n( \" More avant-garde rubbish\" I thought). The evening transformed me, and I have become a devotee of\nthis writer's brand of humorous obliquity.\nThe evening at the Shaw starts with\" After Ma grit te\", \u2014 a lightweight\nplay which opens in the utmost ob-s curit y, with( amongst other seeming absurdities) a man in waders telling\na girl in a ball dress about a one-legged footballer skipping along with at otto is e under his arm, but carries\nthrough to a conclusion that is as utterly logical as it is funny, with all explained.\" The Real Inspector Hound\" how-ever, which forms the bulk of the\nevening, begins quite reasonably,\nwith two critics, Moon and Bird boot,( sic) awaiting the opening of a Wh oas she was before; he is not helping\nthe \" cause\". This friction makes her\nmore determined than ever to remain\nslim. The final scene shows a surprised, perhaps perplexed, Tom confronting\na noticeably changed Fat Friend. But the play ends, for me, puzzling ly; it\nwas ambiguous. I was ambivalent where at first I emphasised. The ending is not unexpected, just odd. This play attempts the terribly\ndaunting task of combining a comedy( first act) with a drama( second act). It was, in general, a successful syn thesis. Only the final minute puzzles\nme. She and Tom have found out\nsomething about themselves and others; James has had a book accepted, finally. But Henry has us\nbaffled. We haven'ta clue what he\nis to do. \u2022\nThat's my only criticism of an otherwise fine production. In a different\nvein from most WestEnd comedy, it\nbenefits thereby. High y recommended. Globe theatre, Shaftesbury Ave. JIM FENNER. Dunnit, which in time comes to bear\nan uncanny resemblance to \" The Mousetrap\"( Hello? This the drawing room of Lady Muldoon' s isolated\ncountry residence one foggy morning in early spring') but by the end the\ncritics are on stage (dead at that)\nand two of the cast are giving the\nplay-within-a play the blasting it\nrightly deserves, which Moon and Bird boot never did. The conventions\nof the WhoDunnit \u2022 are lovingly\nrocked(' I 've known whole week-ends when Muldoon Manor, as this\nlovely Queen Anne House is called, might as well have been floating on pack-ice for all the good it would have done phoning the Police'), the\ncritics are slated, the plot thickens\nand Stoppard' s use of language tri-u mph so 'er all. The current production of \" The Real Inspector Hound\" is coming, with its companion piece \" After Ma grit te\" into the last fortnight of its\nrun at the Shaw Theatre, (halfway\nbetween Euston and St. Pancras Stations), but it is still as worthwhile as\nany show in London. Tickets from\n2 5 p for Students. Bob Carter\nThe IC Operatic Society put on a creditable performance, for IC at\nleast, with their production of\n\" lol an the\" last week in the Union. The audience was as packed as the\nstage during the finale; the entire cast\non stage resembled more the rush\nhour on the Circle Line than a chorus\nline.\nThe individual performances that\nstood out were Barney Burnham and Brian Parsons as the two Earls, Pat\nElliot as the lovelorn Ph yl is and Peter Mills as the very susceptible\nChancellor. Unfortunately Private\nWill is of the Grenadier Guards appeared to be struggling to find his\nnotes, and an electrically cranked Fairy Queen would have been an ad vantage: the impressions of Cilia Black, without the accent, came over\nabove the music in a definitive f ash ion.\nThe Orchestra, largely consisting of drafted members of RCM( as was the majority of the female chorus)\ndid their stuff with vigour: only when over loud or subtly quiet did they fail\nto sound convincing. The stage, set off by what appeared\nto be eminently edible scenery, was severely cramped. The fairies tended\nto come across as a1s tX Von their\nown; the effect when joined by the Earls, Dukes, Marquises, Viscounts and Barons was one of the Op soc Gang Show \u2014 and their obvious enjoyment of the whole proceedings convinced everyone that they were riding along on the crest of a wave. Concert\nOnly after a great last minute rush\ndid.I manage to get to the concert on Saturday night. Unfortunately I missed the beginning of Back Door's set, but from what I heard (I certainly\ncouldn't see anything for periods\nlonger than five seconds), they\nseemed to have developed quite an original brand of bluesy music, using\nbass, drums and saxes.\nDuring the interval, I managed to\nsqueeze into a rather small region on the floor, but this merely shifted the\ndiscomfort and about quarter of an hour after Fairport had taken a stage\nin almost total, but temporary, dark-ness, I was virtually praying that each\nnumber would be their last.\nAs for their music, I was surprised at the number of songs they bor-rowed. These consisted of \" Country Pie\", Dylan' s George Jackson, and also ones from Jerry Reid and Buddy Holly. Their own compositions were quite good, and generally light on the\near, though there were times when they jigged along quite nicely, especially in the encore, Dave Swarbrick' s fiddling injecting a little fire at these\ntimes.\nNot unnaturally, they included a few pieces from their new album,\" Rosie\", among which was the title\ntrack, a delightful ballad. Despite all this, I can't help feeling that they\nhave seen better days in their long\nand complicated history. For those\nwho are interested, the present lineup is Jerry Donnahue and Trevor\nLucus, electric and acoustic guitars,\nDavey Pegg, bass, Dave Swarbrick. fiddle and mandolin, and Dave Mattocks, drums, with just about everyone having a go at singing. SOUNDER( U). Rialto, Coventry Street, from the end of the month. Directed by Martin Ritt\nSounder is the name of the dog belonging to a coloured family who live and work on a sugar farm in\nLouisiana during the Depression(1933). If you( like me) have an instinctive abhorrence of animal films, don't be put off, because the\nstory is more about the relationship\nbetween the son and the father during\nthe difficult times they all have to go\nthrough. The father is arrested for\nstealing food and is sentenced to a year's penal servitude, but due to\nlocal policy, the family are not allowed to know where he is being\nkept. The son manages to find out\nvia a sympathetic local white woman, and prepares to make the 5 0 - mile journey on foot to find his father.\nEventually he finds the prison camp, but is unable to find him, but is taken\nunder the wing of a black school mistress who, recognising his in tell i gence, offers to take him into the\nschool for the next term.\nI came out of this film feeling\nrather overwhelmed by what I thought\nwas the excessive wholesomeness, though this may be, as someone pointed out, because there is no rape\nscene or car chase. What is good about this film, however, is the splendid acting by everyone, even the dog, but more important, the basic attitude of the film. The coloured family\nis dealt with sympathetically, but not\nover-indulgently ( which was one of\nmy criticisms of \" Guess Who' sCo ming to Dinner\"), the family were treated in exactly the same way as if\nthey were some poor white family\nin a1950's Hollywood budget movie.\nThere was no race-relations preach ing at all. For that I was grateful.\nThe direction and camera work were good, but not outstanding: the\nfilm tended to drag on occasions, and the camera shots were nice, but un varied. ( Music, incidentally, by Taj\nMahal, and very good). So go, and take your girlfriend with you, if you like to see nice people in nice surroundings winning through. But if,\nlike me, you like to escape into a cinema, don't worry, the rest of the\nfilm industry is on our side.\n' SERGEI' Felix Diftrg It's different over there\nTUESDAY,20 th FEBRUARY1235 Catholic Society Mass.

Are you looking for a place to spend those\nundecided years between high school\nand working? Do you want a place to\ngo to get away from nagging teachers,\nnagging parents, nagging world problems and simple pain of arthritis\nand neuralgia? Well, friends, you need look no farther. Clarkson College of Technology is the place for\nyou. Ideally situated in lovely Potsd am New York, you will be overlooking the scenic Racquette River, known all over the North Country for its\nflowing water. Are you from a big city? Potsdam is afflicted with the\nhighest unemployment rate in the\nstate, which means you will be able\nto choose from a wide range of\nslums, marauding gangs of alcohol crazed youths, and perverts of all shapes and sizes. Are you from a small town? You will be able to enjoy\nthe latest in big-city conveniences,\nsuch as electricity, telephones, and streets named after every imaginable\nspecies of tree. Yes, people from all types of environment will feel right\nat home here in Potsdam. But what does Potsdam have to\noffer in the way of entertainment, you ask? Just one of the highest bars-per-capita rating in upstate New York.\nMany of industry's finest alcoholics got their start right here in Potsdam. We also boast the only $ 1 . 5 0 movie\ntheater left in the world and also a McDonald's and a Carroll' s and a Mister Donut for those interminably\nlong, hazy nights when all you seem\nto do is get hungry. For the male\nchauvinists we have a whole college filled with girls just a short walk\naway. For the female the males at\nClarkson outnumber you10 to 1. Rem ember you don't have to look pretty\nto make it here at Tech, all you need\nis a sense of adventure, a desire to\nreach out for what you want and enough money to pay for it.\nPotsdam is easily accessible by all major dogsled lines and by some jeeps. During the summer you will be\nable to leave Potsdam by any form\nof transportation known to man. The summer usually runs from early July to late July which makes for a lot of\nfun in the sun except during the rainy\nseason \u2014 early January to late Dec em ber. For those who would rather fly,\nthe town of Potsdam operates a large\nwell-equipped cow pasture which can easily be converted into a parachute\ntarget area in times of national emer-gen cy. All these things are merely frosting\non the cake, however. Not only is\nClarkson located in a fabulous entertainment mecca, but it is also the site\nof a fine engineering school. We offer\ncourses leading to degrees in Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, Civil, and Choo Choo Train Engineering. Not to\nmention our pioneering Industrial\nConstipation Department, and the\nnewly mismanaged Industrial Mis management Department. But Clarkson does not believe in cluttering a student's mind with just facts and figures. We believe a well rounded\nindividual should also have his mind cluttered with history, novels, letter\nwriting and lots of compositions which test your ability to write lots\nof compositions. Our Humanities and Social Insignificance Department are\nnot overlooked just because Clarkson is an engineering school. Clarkson spends thousands of dollars a year\nof your money so that you will know who was the Assistant Secretary of\nState in 1 8 3 2 and that the \" Grapes of Wrath\" is not a book about violence in the wine industry.\nBut, all work and no play makes\nJohnny apply to another school and we have a firm policy of not letting\ngo of any student who can still pay\npaper, the Clarkson Integrator. Nothing like I.C., of course, as you'rt\nsee. . . .\nhis own way. Therefore, wee mph a size freedom of choice in choosing one's courses and schedule. YOU have the freedom to protest OUR choice of which classes you are to\nattend. You also have the freedom to sit wherever you want in the class\nunless your professor makes the\nchoice for you. We have recently begun to offer a number of pass-fail\noptions \u2014 your professor has the-option, of course. These and other\ninnovative teaching methods have\nearned Clarkson College the Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial for Modern Instructional Methods in a Techno log ical School Located in or Near a Small Rural Town and For the Prevention\nand Extinction of Loquacious ness. Many of you cringe, however, at the thought of accidentally learning\nanything while enjoying yourself at\ncollege. For a slight decrease in tuition you may pursue a degree of\nBachelor of Arts in Extra-Curricular\nActivities. Some of the more noteworthy graduates in this field include\nClarkson' s Board of Trustees, the\nPresident of General Pinball, and Bugs Bunny. You may also choose to\nparticipate in outside activities in addition to your other major. Be aD.J. on WT S CFM. Do you like comic books? \u2014 get on the staff of the Clarkson newspaper. Do you like to-sleep late? \u2014 cut classes. There's something for everyone here at Tech. You will also be able to attend the many parties, dances and cancelled concerts which are jointly sponsored by Clarkson and Potsdam State.\nOf course, in order to more fully\nappreciate your life at Clarkson, you-will need a place to live. We offer a variety of living conditions which are designed to emulate the neigh-bor hood you would like. There are decrepit tenements known as Ham lin-Powers, low income housing projects in the Cub ley Reynolds Ross Brooks complex, middle class\" nice\" rooms in Moore House and modern-pre-fab s for social recluses in Dorms5 and6. We realize that for many of you, this will be your first time living\naway from your parents and you won't be prepared for sudden inde-pen den ce. To make your transition\neasier, we require you to live on cam pus for at least two years. We also\nsupply each floor with a Resident\nBabysitter. You will not be allowed to drive, have girls in your room, smoke pot, make noise after 1 0 : 0 0 p.m. or\ngo out in the rain without your rub-be rs. After four years at Clarkson you will have gained enough independence to be able to go out into the\nworld and cross the street by yourself (don't forget to look both ways iy. Clarkson College of Technology wants you to become a responsible,\nrespected member of society for only\n$ 4 , 5 0 0 a year.\nOur admissions requirements are\nbased solely on academic achieve-ment. If you are a high school g radu ate, or expect to be within the next\nfour years, please enclose one year's tuition and you will become a mem ber of the class of ' 7 7 . Two years'\ntuition, prepaid, will qualify you for\nthe class of ' 7 6 ? and also for our grand prize drawing of a free toaster.\nDue to a limited amount of funds,\nscholarships can only be awarded to\nthe most deserving students. Therefore, anyone who pays for four full\nyears in advance will receive a full-tuition scholarship to Potsdam State's Crane School of Music. Your money\nwill be used to finance our new soci at science lab, to be located in the\nArlington Inn.\nIf there are any further questions\nplease address all inquiries to Chancellor John Graham, somewhere in\nthe Bahamas.

Norman St. John Stevas, under-Se-c ret ary of state for the\nDES hasn't seen anyone\nfrom the NUS since he\ntook office, Well, the\nGovernment will hardly\nbe able to ignore this de-mo, as we'll be right outside their windows.\nSPORTS: \u2014 so that all\nsporting students won't have to face the dilemma\nof a muddy pitch or the\ndemo, the ACC has cancelled all sports fixtures\nexcept for a few cup and\nleague games which cannot be rearranged. Come\nalong then, and bear in\nmind that beer is not one\nof those commodities\nwhose price is fixed by\nstage II so if you want to\nbe able to afford a few\njars in six month time,\ncome along and make\nsure you get a higher\ngrant now.\nAll social reps are reminded to publicise the\ndemo on blackboards and\nmake announcements in\nlectures today and tom or row.\nAt Queen's tower at\n12.45 we shall be joined\nby the mass contingents of\nstudents from other Usk\ncolleges. Tickets for the\nUnderground will be sold\n\u2014 price 15p \u2014 a paltry\nsum compared to the \u00a3100\np.a. increase we're de-manding. At1.15 the demo will move off to South\nKen, where trains will be\nwaiting to take us to Russell Square. We assemble\nin Malet Street and at 2.15\nwe move off with all the\nother colleges in the Southern region down Southhampton Row to the\nKingsway, round the A ld wych (legally a demo is a vehicle and so has to observe one-way systems)\nand across Waterloo\nBridge to the DES. The rally after the demo\nwill be held on the South\nBank near the DES. Speakers at the rally will be\nfrom a London based\nTeachers' Union, the Labour Party, various Trade\nUnions and Digby Jacks\n(Pres. NUS) and Judy\nCotter (Pres. U LIES A). The importance of you\ncoming to this demo cannot be underestimated,\nbecause the strength of arguments that the NUS have in a week's time will\ndepend a lot on the turnout for this demo.\nSEX For further Unexpurgated\nDetails come to\nthe Queen's Tower at\n12.45 tomorrow\nDIRECT\nACTION!\n90%\nsupport for\nRefectory\nBoycotts\nTwo refectory boycotts have taken place so tar,\nboth at Southside. They were organised by the Union executive, (some of them) and the grants action com-mitte e, following a( quo rate) vote at the union meeting\nof February 1 to hold refectory boycotts as part of the\nI.C. campaign in support of the N.U.S. grants cam-pa ign. As the time when the negotiations between the\nN.U.S. and the DE.S, are to take place draws closer,\n(Feb. 27), it is felt by the grants action committee to\nbe important that students demonstrate their solidarity\nwith their leadership.\nThere were about\ntwenty Students picketing\nstudents who had intended\nto eat in the refectory, and\non the second occasion\nsome people stood outside\nMe chEng to save people\nthe walk back to College\nBlock. It is impossible to\nassess the exact financial\nimpact, or to find out the\npercentage success in terms\nof the number of students,\nsince Mr. Mooney is suppressing certain in form a tion. In particular, whereas before the final till\nreceipts were rung up after\nlunch, as is normal in any\nshop, now the till is covered up, or the final total,\nwhen read, is replaced by\na row of nines or 50p. But\nthe people who eat at\nSouthside regularly (very\nUGM LASHES OUT OVER REFECTORY PRICES\nThursday's Union Meeting showed its anger over\nrefectory prices in sharply-worded exchanges during\nthe President's report.\nJohn Lane, ICU President,\nreported that Mr. Mooney\nwas asking for a25% rise\nto cover the losses his refectories were likely to in cur this year.\nVarious members of the\nUnion told the meeting\nthat, even though price in creases had not been\napproved, Mr. Mooney\nhad instructed his staff to\nreduce the size of portions\nand to charge double if\nthe portions appear to be\nlarge (even if you haven't asked for a large portion).\nAngry members claimed\nthat this constituted a price rise, and were only\nquiet ene don being told\nthat refectory prices\nwould be a major topic\nof discussion at the next\nUnion Meeting on Thursday week.\nMr. Mooney has been\ninvited to this meeting to\nstate his case and to\nanswer questions, and,\nsince the U GM comes only\nan hour before the\nnext Refectory Committee\nmeeting, it is hoped that it\nwill have some effect.\nMINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE STEPS IN At the end of January\nMr. Mooney wrote to the\nMinistry of Agriculture to\nask clearance to raise\nprices under the freeze. Informed sources say that\nthe Ministry replied to the\neffect that prices can be\nraised to recoup increased\ncosts of raw materials if\nprofit margins are not in-creased, but that since\nMooney's increased turnover since 1971 has covered such increases and\nChe profit reduction has\nbeen caused by wage in creases, no increase in\nprices would be permissible. The Ministry will\nnot agree to price rises to\ncover increased wages\nbill's. FELIX SURVEY FELIX is to survey refectories next week for\ndiscrepancies in prices and\nquantities, and our report,\nWhich? Refectory will be\npublished in next week's issue. So watch out, Mr. Mooney, Felix's plainclothes consumers are\ncoming!\nChin people, often with\nscurvy), estimated 7 0 %\nand 9 0 % respectively in\nthe two boycotts so far.\nWhat is perhaps more\nencouraging is that many\npeople were persuaded by\nthe pickets to support the\nboycotts, by, it must be\npointed out, verbal per sua sion. Many of the people\nwere not acquainted with\nthe N.U.S. campaign, and\nwhen they were told, were\ntotally in support of all the claims. Most of the\npeople who did eat were\nstaff, and a lot of Mor mons. One of them said\nthat he did support the\nclaim, and assured us that\nGod was on our side, but\nhe was hungry. Of the students who went in, the\ncommonest comment was\nyes, I support the claim\nfor increased grants, but\nthis is not the way to do it.\nNon; of these students was\nat the Union Meeting\nwhich voted for refectory\nboycotts. Again, some students argued for the\n\"rights of the individual to\neat where he pleases, that\nbeing democracy.\" It was\nargued that this concept is\nwrong. Democracy consists\nof supporting the democratically taken decisions\nof a particular organ is a tion, and in changing these\ndecisions within the framework of the organisation.\nStudents can expect\nmore lightning boycotts.\nAll the pickets are very\ngentle people, and the one\nor two people who intend\nto walk past the pickets\nare urged to stop and\nargue the case.\n\n"

The Club started life\nas the University of London Canada\nClub back in 1 9 6 2 , and BUN AC was formed the following year to expand\nthe cultural and travel possibilities\nof the U. L.C.C. into a national club\nfor all university students, with\nbranches at each University. By the\nend of its first year of existence,\nBUN A Chad some3,000 members\nand had operated its first transatlantic flight programme of 11 flights.\nFrom the start it was felt that for\nthe Club to be successful, it would be better if it did not run its own travel programme, but had an agent\nto run it. This would avoid BUN AC having too strong an image of a travel\nclub, and allow it to concentrate\nmore on purely Club activities. The BUN AC flight programme was then,\nas now, handled by B.S.T. C. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the British Universities Student Travel Association( BUSTA) which is a nonprofit educational charity and whose surpluses are directed towards student travel scholarships.\nDuring the 1 9 6 0 ' s BUN AC's membership soared and its flight programme expanded so that by the end of the decade its annual membership was regularly approaching\n2 0 , 0 0 0 . This caused something of a problem for the flight programme because as an affinity group, the Club's charters were limited by a Civil Avi ation Board's rulings of a20,000 membership limit and a\"6 months' membership before you can fly\" rest ric tion.\nAccordingly, B.S.T. C., which by\nthen had moved into the European\nStudent Flights business, obtained\npermission for BUN AC to operate its\ntransatlantic charters on the same\nbasis as those of European flights.\nThis benefited the student in three\nways. First of all, he did not have\nto be a club member for 6 months \u2014\nhe could join today and fly tom or row. Secondly, he didn't have to be\nan actual University student \u2014 any student between 16 and30 was eli-gi ble. Finally, he was no longer tied\nto a fixed outward and return date\npackage, but could choose his East\nand West-bound flights separately to\nsuit his particular plans.\nCertainly no one can accuse\nBUN AC of not trying their utmost to\nlive up to their slogan and\" make America possible\" for British students\nto visit with the minimum of cost and\nfuss. Over 6 0 , 0 0 0 members have\nflown BUN AC over the last ten years\nand helped them gain an excellent\nreputation for reliability in the sector\nof student travel.\nO.K. Big Deal. But how does\nBUN AC operate and what does it offer the student?\nBUN AC operates on two levels \u2014\nnationally and at college or university level.\nOn a national scale, BUN AC has its headquarters in London at 4 6 Charlotte Street, where it employs a small, full-time staff. They ensure that the\ncollege North America Clubs are kept\nsupplied with membership cards,\nhandbooks, publicity, etc., and they\nalso do the running of the Club's services such as BUN A CAMP, as u mmer camp counselling scheme; the\nBUN AC EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMME, which enables students to\nget a summer work visa for the USA; and the BUN AC EMPLOYMENT SERVICE, which fixes up guaranteed jobs\nin the summer vac. for those students\nwho are unable to find a job for\nthemselves and would otherwise not\ngo to the US. All policy decisions regarding\nBUN AC are made solely by a National\nCommittee, composed entirely of\nstudents and elected annually from\nrepresentatives of the various North\nAmerica Clubs around the country.\nThis ensures that BUN AC's services\nare kept in touch with what students\nwant and can afford, i.e. it is run by\nstudents for the benefit of students.\nAt a University level, the voluntary\nNAC committees are responsible for\nrecruiting members and encouraging\ninterest in North America by holding\nfilm shows, talks, etc., and by being\navailable to answer members' questions on travel, employment, and the\nlike. I.C. has had its own North\nAmerica Club for some years now, and those wishing to find out about\ntravel to America or interested in\nhelping to run the Club are asked\nto contact Chris Gibbs ( Weeks84) or Bob Evans (Tizard 1 5 4 ) . IC NAC urgently needs helpers.\nFinally a word or two about some\nof the services BUN AC are operating for 1 9 7 3 : \u2014\n(1) 1 9 7 3 Flight Programme.\nThis year the student has the\nchoice of over 1 0 0 flights to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco,\nToronto or Vancouver, departing from\neither London. Belfast, Birmingham, Manchester or Prestwick. He also\nhas the choice of booking a student\nflight, or an ABC( Advance Booking\nCharter) flight for a few pounds less,\nalthough on some routes only ABC flights operate.\nABC charters are being introduced\nthis year and will be the only sort\nof charter allowed in future. Briefly,\nthe advantages of ABC flights are\nthat they are cheaper and are not subject to any eligibility restrictions. This\nmeans that a student can now take\nhis parents or girlfriend (who perhaps\nis not a student) to the States at a low price whereas for student flights\nonly husbands/ wives can accompany\nthe student. The drawback to ABC flights is that they must be booked\nthree months in advance, whereas\nstudent flights can be booked right\nup to the last minute.\nReturn flights to New York start\nat \u00a358 ( ABC) or \u00a362 (student\nflight). These rates are fully competitive with, if not cheaper than,\nrates offered anywhere \u00bbIse, especially since they include such extras\nas free drinks and meals on the\nflights, hotel accommodation in North\nAmerica on the night of arrival, plus\ntransport from airport to hotel, airport taxes, and a copy of the \" Student Guide to North America\". Students can rely on BUN AC's reputation for reliability, especially this\nyear with the airline carrier being\nalmost exclusively Panam.\n(2) Bunacamp\nThis programme is aimed at those\nwho enjoy the outdoor life but maybe cannot afford to shell out the money\nfor flight. Greyhound pass, etc., before departure. The scheme offers an eight-week job as a counsellor in an\nAmerican children's summer camp.\nAll the student has to pay is cm \u00a38\nregistration fee, and Bun a camp pays\nfor his flight, transport to the camp,\nboard and lodgings and a minimum of $ 1 7 5 pocket money.\nThere are still some vacancies for\ninstructors in certain sports \u2014 contact IC NAC for more details, but\nhurry as lists close shortly.\n(3) Exchange Visitor Programme\nFor those who do not fancy camp counselling there is the E VP, operated\nby BUN AC in conjunction with the\nUS-based Council of International\nEducational Exchange.\nAdmission to this programme gives\nthe student a J l visa which enables\nhim to take any form of paid employment in the U.S. and thus makes a summer vacation in America financially viable.\nEvery year over 3 , 0 0 0 users of the\nprogramme discover that working for\nabout 8 weeks and travelling around\nfor about 4 weeks need only cost\nthem the same as a fortnight's holiday\nin Europe.\nMany wait until after arrival in the\nStates to find a job, bu f for those\nwho don't Wish to do this there is\nalways the BUN AC Job Directory.\n(IC NAC are hoping to arrange a talk about the E VP on Thursday, February 2 2 ) .\nIC North America Club \u2014 Contact\nChris Gibbs ( Weeks84); Bob Evans\n(Tizard 1 5 4 ) for details of member-ship, etc.\nOxford St eet was declared independent last Wednesday by rev o luton aries f;o mRC S brandishing placards and coil ect 'ng t'n s.

Almost every University or\nCollege in the UK that has a X country team (and\neven some without!) will be there, bringing Olympic\nrunners Dave Bedford, Ray Smedley and Andy Hol den, and many other internationals.\nThe local attractions included a weakened IC team\nand an Old Boys team, (they're not so old, so watch\nout IC!). The RCM have answered the call \" You too\ncan run against Dave Bedford\", they have threatened\nto withdraw if he fails to turn up!\nThe race will be started in Rotten Row by the Rector\nat 3.00 on Saturday and the prizes presented by Lady\nPenney in the union afterwards.\nAnybody wishing to help should contact Steve Webb\nor just arrive early at the Union; they will be able to\nfight for tea with the rest.\nfootball\nTHREE IN A ROW FOR I.C. BATES DESTROYS U.C. At Headstone Lane on Saturday 10th February, IC made sure of their third UL cup final in three years by defeating UC2 \u20140.\nThe conditions were not suited to good football and\nthe game was never a great spectacle, but there were a few isolated moments of good play from both sides.\nThe first twenty minutes belonged to UC. They had a shaky IC defence in trouble several times and, but for\nGerwyn Edwards' good work in goal, IC would have\nbeen in even more trouble. One save in particular\nshowed the class of Edwards. A shot from 20 yards\nwas hit hard and low, with the wind and despite the\ngreasy turf he managed a great dive to his left to push\nit away for a corner.\nAs the game wore onIC began to settle down and\nonce Paul Worthington had accustomed himself to the\npoor surface, his winger was rarely in the game. The man of the match, however, was Steve Bates whose\nmidfield tackling gave UC no chance to settle down\non the ball. But Bates did more than tackle \u2014 from a partly-cleared corner he pulled the ball down and struck a deceptively lazy shot which swerved viciously\nunder the despairing dive of the UC 'keeper.\nWith this goal behind them IC took command for\nthe rest of the half and were unlucky not to score at\nleast another two goals. Maurice Hastings went close\nwith a header from a corner kick and Billy Milne beat\nthe 'keeper with a delicate shot after a good run, only\nto see the ball cleared off the line.\nWhen the half-time interval came IC were well in control of the game. But as often happens to IC they\nstarted the 2nd half as they started the first, badly.\nUC only really had one good scoring chance but the\ngeneral performance of IC during this period was\npoor. However, just as in the first half they came back\nstrongly. Steve Bates was still getting the tackles in and it did one good to see Pete Lonnen working so\nhard in midfield. He is undoubtedly much more useful\nthere than on the wing.\nChances to score were still rare for both sides and\nmost of the second half was played between the penalty areas. Byron Smith and Billy Milne both had half-chances to score but with ten minutes to go the score\nwas still 1\u20140 and it didn't look much like changing.\nThen tragedy hit IC, a perfectly fair tackle left Mau rice Hastings with a nasty bruise, superimposed on four\nor five other ones which he has picked up during the\nseason. Hastings had to go off and the sub., a defender came on in midfield. Almost immediately IC launched the decisive attack of the match. One long\nball was cleared and Bates promptly chipped it back\nto the edge of the box where Smith headed it on to\nMilne who sent IC to Motspur again with a close-range\nshot.\nUC didn't seem to appreciate that they had been\nfairly beaten and the last 10 minutes were just a little\nsilly. In fact they were bloody stupid. Kicking a goalkeeper repeatedly when he is on the ground is not very\nclever. But then UC footballers never were very clever.\nI would like to be able to say that the referee was\nresponsible for the game not deteriorating into a battle\nbut it was in fact only the restraint of the IC team\nwhich kept the free kicks down to two a minute during the last five minutes.\nNow to nicer things: the final will be at Motspur\nPark on Saturday 10th March when IC will attempt to\nmake it three in a row against Birkbeck or Bedford.\nThere is also the possibility of winning the league after a fine display in beating King's recently.\nTeam: G. Edwards, M. Manning, P. Worthington, I. Postlethwaite, I. Bell, J. Kelly, S. Bates, P. Lonnen,\nB. Smith, M. Hastings (sub. R. Kill), W. Milne.\nOn the same day at Birkbeck's ground at Greenford in the Upper Reserves Cup Semi-Final IC 3rds defeated IC 5th s in a fast and open game. The 5th s produced some hard running which unsettled their opponents and the opening minutes were evenly contested. Control was made difficult by a heavy shower before the game and perhaps this was the factor which made the game close. Eventually the 5th s were\npushed back into defence and a period of constant pressure\nproduced a fine angled drive from Geoff Gilbert which Gordon Lack managed to turn round the post. The 3rds were not\nto be denied and shortly afterwards a goal came. Alan Peterson received the ball near the edge of the box and floated a shot into the corner of the net as the defence stood flatfooted seemingly confused by the flight of the shot. This\nproved to be the only goal of the half and the second-half\nbegan with a further period of 3rd team pressure.\nThe 5th s counter-attacked and produced their best chance\nof the game when a fine cross from the left beat the defence\nand left Pete Bintliff with an open goal which he surprisingly\nmissed from close in. A clinching goal came when Alan Wilkinson surged through from defence and scored a typical\nmidfield-strikers goal when his 30 yards effort eluded Gordon\nLack to make the score 2\u20140. The 3rds now go on to meet\nBirkbeck 2nds in the final at Motspur Park on March 10th, where they will be trying to make up for the 2nd teams'\nthoughtlessness in allowing Goldsmith's to win it last year.\nImperial's other semi-finalists, the 6th s went down 2\u20140 to\nan LSE IV which looked not unlike LSE II. However the 6th s have done well to get this far and they still have a good'\nchance in the League.\nR.K./ A.P.t idd ly w It has fallen to me once again to write a Winks\nreport, the one you've all been waiting for. On Sunday, U th February, we ventured up the A10 in2 cars, pulling our star player behind on an air bed. We were visiting Cambridge to play them in the Prince\nPhilip Silver Wink competition, and our team was once\nagain glorious in defeat. As we were two players short,\nBob and Helen each had to play a pair, while Glyn suffered J.J. and Mike played with Shelagh (!)\nThe brilliant Mr. Douglas (6 second interviews to\ndate) managed to win a game in his own inimitable\nstyle while the rest of us lost, or drew.\nWe were drastically handicapped by the licensing\nhours and being booze less could not attain the usual\nhigh standard of play reached on Thursday nights.\nCrawling around on the floor is not suitable for people\nwith flash jackets or delicate young ladies (that means\nme and if you disagree I 'll bash you), but against these\nterrific odds we scored 22 (Helen 8^, Bob8 \u00a3, the rabble\n5) to their 62.\nAfter 3 rounds we adjourned for milk and hot water\n(they called it \"tea\"), b ikki es and the Beano.\nBob, the co iff eur, said he was great\u2014perhaps that's why the car windows steamed upon the way back\nto Southside bar for a pint or six, to end the day in style.\nThe previous week we entertained Quesh, a team of\nex-Southampton University members. They had in their\nclan a certain Alan Dean, the English champion, no\nless. Against such formidable opponents we lost 1\\\u2014\n55|, but the outstanding achievement of the year must\nsurely be the gaining of a point off A.D., the second\npoint he'd lost in five games!\nUnfortunately we were without Bobby, before whom\nmountains collapse, ferocious beasts tremble and\nWinks players plead for clemency from the tortuous\ndealings of his squid ger. Without this maestro, how\ncould we hope to win?\nThanks to all those that turned up to play, and to\nthose that didn't \u2014 * * ? ! \u00a3 ? * ! !\nThought for the day \u2014 is beef curry a new type of\ntrouser cleaner?\nThe Wonder Team: Helen Isaac (latent genius), Bob\" Flash\" Douglas, Glyn Jones, Mike Ixer, John James\nand Shelagh Crawley. A men. he cke j/ Last Wednesday, the I.C. cup side qualified to meet Guy's hospital in the final of the U.L. cup, by defeating Barts30. This victory was achieved by the I.C.'s normal game of ten\nmen hockey, i.e. keep your own goalkeeper out of the game.\nFor the first ten minutes, the ball was continually in or\naround the Bart's twenty-five, but their goalkeeper was\nuntroubled in this period. Then for the rest of the first half,\nneither of the teams could be bothered to get going, so the\ngame became bogged down between the twenty-fives. The\nonly moment that relieved the boredom was a goal by John\nSchofield.\nThe second half was completely different, as I.C. scored\ntwice in the first five minutes. The first of these goals came\nfrom a short corner pushed out by Iki Keller to Jaz Missn,\nwho pushed the ball into the centre for Jag Gahir to push\nhome. The final goal was scored by John Schofield.\nThe previous Saturday, I. C.1st XI met B.A.C. Weybridge\nand deservedly won 2-1, the goals coming from Downs and\nRickman.\nMeanwhile the 2nd and 3rd XIs were playing Old Creights\n1st and 2nd teams. The 2nds won10, but the 3rds were\ndefeated 2-0.\nMixed Hockey\nLast Sunday the I.C. mixed hockey team played Westfield\nCollege. Victory was assured, with tft e executioner on the\nI.C. side and the final score was 2-1 to I.C. Straight from the\nbully in the first half, I.C, swept into the attack, and scored,\nbut were unable to score again before half-time. Westfield\ncame more into the game in the second half, and after a hectic scramble in the I.C. goal mouth, Westfield were\nawarded a short corner, from which they scored, to make the\nfinal score 2-1. I.C. should have won this match much more\nconvincingly, when one considers the number of chances\nthey created.\nFinally, a special thanks to all the people who played on Sunday lunchtime.\n\n"
