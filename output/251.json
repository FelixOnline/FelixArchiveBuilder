    "content": "2 FELIX\nSECURITY\nAT IC\nIn an organisation as large as I.C., with its great number of\nresearch projects and its valuable equipment, security plays an important part. Thus it is disturbing to find that security is not what\nit should be, especially in the Union building, and that virtually anyone could walk in and walk off with anything he wished.\nSOVIET UNION\n50 YEARS AFTER Union\nUnder the present conditions\nthe security guards spend more of\ntheir time ensuring that experiments do not go berserk than they\ndo controlling the movement of\npeople in the buildings. The situation is especially bad in the\nUnion Building which they describe as impossible to check.\nWhen the last person leaves the\nUnion Building the Duty Officer\nmakes a final check, sees that\ncertain doors are bolted and reports to the Security Guards,\nwhose responsibility the building\nthen becomes. Often, however,\nthis is not done, especially when\nmembers of Dramsoc., Ents and\nFELIX are working. After this\nthe building is patrolled about\nevery two hours. This would be\nfairly satisfactory if it were not\nfor the fact i hat it is almost impossible to make sure that the\nUnion is empty in the first place\nas there are three staircases and\nseveral doors through which people can gain admission.\nInside the Union there is no\nalarm system and so while the\nsilver cupboard is locked it is still\npossible to remove the silver.\nBreaking into the Union is simple\nas was shown by UC when they\nstole Mike at the beginning of\nlast session. Since then the only\ntightening of security has been the\nfitting of special window locks at\nthe back of the Union at street\nlevel. Should a guard be attacked\nwhile on patrol it could be, according to the guards, up to two\nhours before anyone would seriously begin to search for him. A check is made on his progress\nthrough a building, but this check\nis only to make sure that the job\nis being done properly.\nPatrols\nFor instance when on patrol in\nthe Beit Quadrangle, the guards\nhave to pass certain clocking,\npoints at which they register their\ntime of passing. This system\nhowever can only check his\nmovements when he returns. In\nthe new buildings there is a much\nmore efficient system\u2014one more\nbenefitting IC\u2014all the clocking\npoints are connected to a control\npanel, and there are facilities for\nthe patrol man to talk to the control desk. In this way a guard\ncan never foe missed for more\nthan about a quarter of an hour.\nIn addition if a key to any door\nis found to be missing it is possible to change the cylinder of\nthe lock in less than half an hour.\nThis makes security much\ntighter in the departments, as it\nshould be'. In addition, everyone\nworking after the building has\nbeen closed must have a pass\nfrom the head of the depart r rien t and on entering this building sign\nin a book. This book is not\nanother piece of bureaucracy, it\nis there to show how many people\nare in the building in case of fire.\nThe book, however, is frequently\nignored, as members of staff have\nkeys to back doors and have no\nneed to pass through the main\nentrance.\nGuards\nPossibly the weakest part of the\nsystem is the men themselves.\nFor the most part the men are\nover 50. They do the job for a variety of reasons\u2014some because\nthey are only physically able to\ndo light jobs, some have sidelines\nand regard the job as an easy way\nof keeping up their stamps. These\nmen work 45 hours a week, in-and earn about \u00a316 a week including overtime. In a large department a patrol takes about two\nhours, during which time they\nmust be constantly on the move.\nThey find their work tiring\nand admit that they put their feet\nup for a couple of hours, which is\nsurprising as they say 24 men are\ninsufficient to look after the whole\ncampus. When a flood occurs,\nwhich is not infrequent due to\nbadly clamped pipes on experiments, this deficiency is especially\nbad.\nMr. Seaford, the Domestic Bursar, who holds ultimate responsibility, admits that security is not\nall that it might be, but adds that\nif there were 100 per cent security, which is anyway impossible\nwith the present financial all oca tion, the movement of people\nwould be so restricted as to endanger their lives in case of fire.\nHe says that there are special arrangements for certain parts of\nthe campus, but what he does not\nknow is that one night his security\nguards were in the Finance Office\nwhen a bell rang which they\nthought was the alarm. It turned\nout to be another guard ringing\nthe door bell.\nThere are possibly two things\nwhich can be done to tighten security up. One is to double the\nnumber of guards\u2014the other is to\nmake sure that existing rules\nabout security are strictly kept\nto. This is essential if I.C. wants\nto gain any research projects from\nthe government and industry and\nif the Wooden Horse Club want\nto keep Mike.\nFortunatelv things are being done\ndone to improve the sec uri tv. which is reputed to be among the\nbest in British universities. When\nthe new college block is finished\nthe guards will move their head-'quarters there and will be able to\nfollow the movements of every\nguard on the campus almost to\nthe last step.\nEX PLO68 The Exploration Society, now\nabout 40 members strong, is\nhoping to get the backing of the\nExploration Board for four expeditions this summer. Plans are\nbeing made for an expedition to\nSierre Leone to study electric\npower and another to Kenya to\nstudy Geology and Botany. Two\nother expeditions to study telecommunications in Ghana and\nelectric power in Spain have also\nbeen suggested.\nAs well as organising expeditions, the society gives students\ninformation about cheap travel\nabroad, produces a yearly review\nand holds a series of lectures.\nThis year they include talks about\nlast summer's expeditions to\nGreenland, Ethoipia and th Orinoco. The next lecture, \" Advanced talk on Kraken\" (Nov.\n2! st). will be of special interest\nto members of IC.\nAlthough well timed, on the\nday of the Moscow celebrations,\nTuesday's general studies lecture\non \" The Soviet Union 50 Years\nAfter,\" failed to touch much of\nthe subject which was not already\nknown. The lecture was given\njointly by Mr. Colin Williams, the\ngeneral secretary of the AngloSoviet Friendship Society and\nMr. Victor Grishin, a member of\nthe Central Committee of the\nSoviet Communist Party, to discuss comments made in the\nTimes now and back in 1917\nabout the Soviet Union.\n\" Strange,\" he said. \" that the\nTimes in 1917 should say, 'Those\nin Petrograd will live to regret\nwhat it is to give anarchy full\nreign,' while today it congratulates the Soviet peoples for their\nachievements.\" Mr. Williams\nadded further that the Times\ncredited this advancement not to\nideology, not to the natural resources in Russia, but to the\nquality of the Russian people.\n\" Why was it then,\" he argued,\n\"That these qualities had not\nrevealed themselves before 1917\nunder the old feudal system ?\nAfter a warning to students about the anti-Soviet propaganda he introduced Comrade\nGrishin. Unfortunately an interpreter was required, which made\nsome of the well-meant compliments of Mr. Grishin sound like\ncold platitudes.\nProgress\n\" The progress of the Soviet\nState is a difficult thing to talk\non for a short time,\" he said,\n\" But facts and figures can give\nan indication of the kind of advancement made.\" Great progress had been made despite the\nfact that twenty of the past fifty\nyears had been spent in wars and\nrestoring the economy after the\nwars. Because the standard of\nliving had improved generally\nover the last few years less money\nwas to be allocated to heavy industry but more to light indus-try, for the production of consumer goods. Experiments are\nnow being carried out in Russia\nin the field of management; to\nprovide factory managers wit fia free hand in enterprises, so that\nthey can use their initiative to\nimprove efficiency at the works.\nMr. Grishin laughed at the way\nwestern writers thought this was\na move towards capitalism. Such\nexperiments had been going on\nfor two years and had proved\nvery effective.\nLater this month OSS are to\nstart operating night-time blood\ndo ning sessions. This scheme\nwhich is the brain-child of Dr.\nPaterson of the Health room,\nseeks to make available to hospitals an all night supply of\nfresh blood when required for\nemergencies.\nThe mechanics of the scheme\nare that the hospital will, in the\nevent of an emergency, contact\nthe Southside night porter, who\nwill knock up one of a number\nof known OSS hall members.\nHe in turn will find from his\nlist a donor of the right blood\ngroup, who at the time is in his\nhall room, and take him to the\nhealth room where the blood will\nbe drawn and rushed to the hos-pital.\nFinally he concluded that\nRussia still had many difficult\nproblems but they would all be\nsolved in time by the Soviet\npeople who are all striving for a better standard of living and\nworld peace.\nThe questions put by the audience had to be simple in order\nto help the interpreter and so\nwere of a practical rather than\nideological nature. On the question of censorship of books and\npapers, Mr. Grishin said that\nthose -which expressed views contrary to the moral and ideological outlook of the Soviet people\nwere prohibited.\nMr. Williams concluded the\nlecture by saying that we must\nbe careful not to compare our\nsophisticated way ,of life in\nBritain which has taken three\nhundred years to develop, with\nthat in Russia which has only\ntaken fifty years. He said that\nwe must appreciate that different\npeoples in the world have different values and cultures from\nourselves. Further, he said that\nprogress in the world must be\nmade towards creating a better\nunderstanding between nations,\nand nations must learn to be\nfriendly towards each other and\nto appreciate each other's differ-en ces. Mr. Grishin presented the College with several attractive souvenirs and gave a book on Soviet\npaintings to the president of the\nI.C. Communist Society.\nOSS, who are organising the\nnormal blood do ning session\naround the college, would like to\nemphasise that anyone in hall\nwho has booked to give blood\nbut would rather join this\nnew night scheme, should cross\noff and contact Barry Bradshaw\nof Civ Eng 3 and Southside 668\n(or sign the other list on the\nboard in the Union). No one\nwho wants to volunteer for the\nnight scheme should give blood\nat the normal session, as there is\na compulsory 21 week recuperation period between donations.\nRemember all blood groups\nare equally valuable, as people\nfall ill in the same ratio as the\nnumber of people in each group !\nSmall section\nof a big business\nCellulose fibres, the basic ingredient of all paper\nproducts, magnified 140 times.\nThe world of paper and paper products continues to\nexpand with dramatic rapidity. The Wiggins Teape\nGroup, as one of the largest producers in this field\nemploying about 20,000 people, is actively concerned\nwith many of the new product applications. A diverse\nresearch and development programme aims to ensure a continuing increase and improvement in our range of\npapers. Our exports to 122 different countries make up\n25% by value of all paper exported from the U.K. We need graduates from all faculties to support our\ngrowth. We train them quickly and thoroughly and give\nearly responsibility in a variety of careers. If you would like\nto know more, please write to the University Liaison\nOfficer, Wiggins Teape Group Management Limited,\nGateway House, 1 Watling Street, London E.C.4, or\ntelephone him on 01 -248 2020.\nThe Wiggins Teape Group\nOPERATION BLOOD NEWTHINK\nAs incorrectly reported in Felix,\nNewthink will be out on November 20th( not the 13th as last issue\nstates).\nThis is a new student magazine\nco-edited by Piers Corbyn (Phy-sics 3).\nThe contents are varied to suit\nall tastes, and included in the first\nissue are features on \" China and\nAsia \" \" Student politics,\" \" Defence spending in relation, to our\nbalanced payments problems,\"\nand many other well-reasoned\nnicely balanced articles.\nOn being asked to describe the\npaper, Piers said : \" well; it has\na front page and a back page,\nand is definitely the student magazine for this white hot technological era.\"\nActually he is being unduly\nmodest. The paper contains 36\npages, and at Is. 6d.a copy is\nalso good value for money.\n\n"

The theme\nwas Britain's entry into the Common Market and Mr. Alison was\nfirst to take the stand.\nChinese Threat\nHe foresaw a change in future\nworld power politics, mainly as a result of the threat of China,\nwhich would direct the attention\nof USA and Russia to the Pacific\nin a united effort to face China.\nThis would mean that the USA\nwould relax political relations in\nEurope, while Russia, owing to\nits geographical position, would\nstrengthen its position in Eastern\nEurope. He considered that it\nwas in Europe's interest to form\nan alliance, in which internal differences would be forgotten, in\norder to withstand the pressures\nof Russia. Britain has always\nbeen a part of Europe, both historically and geographically, and\nso should take steps to join the al-li ance. As regards economics,\nhis reasoning was not so com-ple te, but he saw that with larger\nengineering projects and new\ntechnical developments Britain\nwould be able to reap great rewards from the EEC, despite all\ndifficulties.\nCost\nSir Robin was not so sure, to\nput it mildly. He was very worried by the effects that the Treaty\nof Rome would have on our\nprivate lives. He made the point\nthat the EEC's institutions could\noverrule any law made in Parliament, and this he considered a threat to our freedom. He said\nthat the cost of joining would be\nat least \u00a3500 million per year\u2014\na heavy burden on the economy.\nMr. Moyle presented a very good\nargument in which he estimated\nthe cost to be nearer \u00a3800 million\na year. A large increase in the\ncost of living would also result\nbecause of the agricultural policy.\nContributed\nby\nC.J. GILLHAM\nACROSS\n1. Versatile knave (4, 2, 3. 6)\n9. 8's bird (7)\n10.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nNOT WORTH\nTWOPENCE?\nSir,\nThe last issue of FELIX contains an in teri ew with our Rector,\nLord Penney, so it is appropriate\nthat the feelings of many people\nabout the Rector should be ex-pressed.\nLast Spring, when it was announced that Lord (then Sir William) Penney was to become our\nRector, a few people (e.g. Malcolm Duckett) created a commotion because of Lord Penny's long and close involvement with\nweapons, mainly nuclear, research and development since the\n1940s. Most other people, while realising that many considered that\nLord Penney had \" mis-used \"\nscience and that his image was\nnot therefore, good for IC, which\nis, after all, a centre of scientific\nand technological progress, felt\nthat Lord Penney might be all\nright as a man and were willing\nto \" give him a try\"; anyway,\nwhat could they do?\nLord Penney had made a number of appearances at IC, all as\nunimpressive (as was noted by\nFELIX) as the last.\nIn his speech to RCS dinner,\nLord Penney did not say much,\nbut that was only a dinner.\nOn Commemoration Day Lord\nPenney spoke for only five min-ute s, again not saying very much.\nRather unimpressive so far.\nWhen asked by FELIX to\ncomment on what Wells said in\n1934 (IC has no social ideas, etc.,\netc.). Lord Penney said, among\nother things, that he would rather\ncriticise non-scientists for their\nignorance and disinterest in\nscience and technology. Ignorance and disinterest\u2014when Lord\nPenney was asked to comment\non the governments increase in\noverseas' students' fees, he said\nthat he could not offer a considered opinion.\nSurely our Rector should be able\nto offer considered opinions; he\nshould think more, rather than\njust be clever. At this moment\nwhen tens of thousands of young\npeople choose Arts rather than\nSciences, we expect our Rector to\nbe able to talk for more than five\nminutes; he should try to give\nus some inspiration and sense of\npu ur pose in what we are doing\u2014\nwe want to be able to feel that\nscience and technology can act u all do good\u2014Do we want to\ndo good?\u2014good for humanity\nrather than weapons manufacturers. P.R. CORBYN.\nMike\nSir,\nIt was with disappointment\nthat I heard of the general attitude being taken by the mem-be rs, and more especially the\nExec, of ICU to their mascot,\nMike. That two members of the\nUnion should consider it necessary to go so far as to steal it\nthemselves in an attempt to stir\nup some interest seems to be a sad reflection on the state of the\nUnion. If the two students concerned would get in touch with\nme via the Editor of Felix, I will\nassist them in any way I can.\nThe mascot was constructed in\nthe first place as being representative of ICU and was only able\nto be stolen because of IC student\napathy . . . time after time aur-ing its construction, student help\npromised was not eventually\nforthcoming and even now,\nnearly a year later, an unlimited\nnumber of students could get in\nand out of the Union at night by\nthe same method used in the\ntheft.\nIt seems to me that the Union\nshould either decide they no\nlonger want Mike and then decide\nwhat to do with it, or they should\ndamn-well put it back on the\nplinth.\nI was also interested to hear\nthat ex-second year student\nFrank Morris was an ex-president\nof WHO although I was president\nlast year and Dick Conn the year\nbefore that!\nI still possess the WHO files,\ntaken to be the documents of\nPresidency, so if the President (or\ncandidate) would get in touch\nwith me I could pass them on.\nYours faithfully,\nRALPH CORNFQRTH.\nIC Politics and\nthe Brain Drain\nThere is growing talk in these\ndays of disillusionment with poli-tics, politicians, democracy and\nthe whole process of democratic\ngovernment.\nAt a Teach-in a week last\nThursday on the Common Market, where three MPs gave their\nviews on the consequences and\nadvisability of Britain joining the\nCommunity there was a total of\nseventeen members of the College\ngiving them a hearing. Although\nit can be said that this is an old\nissue and there is very little that\npeople do not know about it now,\nLord Chalfont's recent indiscretions at Lausanne and M. Couve\nde Murville's Gaullist uttering s at\nthe last meeting of the E.E.C. did\ngive it a certain topical importance. The Teach-in certainly\ndeserved more than the half per\ncent of the members of what the\nObserver, in a leading article,\ncalled the \" . . . Only centre of\nexcellence in the country! \" While\nI would be the last person to say\nthat people ought to go to political Teach-ins, the present rumblings in the country on the low\nstatus of its technologists and\nscientists and their non-part ic ipa tion in governmental affairs and\nmanagerial positions seems ridiculous, when the students of the\n\"centre of excellence\" are not\nconcerned about one of the most\nimportant economic and political\ndecisions ever to be made by\nBritain. Why bother about the\n\" Brain Drain \" when the brains\ndo not, in fact, care about the\ncountry they live in, and thus\nwould not be an asset to society\nanyway? One is led to suggest\nthat they would be a liability if\nthey were given a larger share in\nmajor decision making. How\nmany people know that if Britain\ndoes join the Common Market\nfood prices would go up by at\nleast 10 per cent and the general\ncost of living by 3 per cent, which\nin simple terms means that\nMooney will raise his prices by\nat least 15 per cent, so that one\ncould then have a meal with foul\ncutlery for about 5s. in the subterranean regions of Southside?\nThe brains of this country like to\nsee magic in hypnotism rather\nthan heckling their elected Members of Parliament. Is it morally\nright for the Political Societies\nCouncil to invite three Members\nof Parliament on a day of three\nbye-elections to lecture to an\naudience of seventeen r jeo Dle? RAKESH MOHAN\nEnts\nSir,\nIn y' edition dated 1st October, 196/, which appeared on\nsale on 1st November, 1967, Colcutt made certain allegations\nabout the intention of Imperial\nCollege Entertainments with regard to the run ing of the Plastic\nFairly Tale. 1 would like to take\nthe opportunity of putting the\nrecord straight.\nThe Plastic Fairy Tale was envisaged as non-profit making entertainment for those members of\nthe College who wished to spend\nan evening dancing to discotheque type sounds in surroundings which were to be somewhat\ngayer and less crowded than it is\npossible to provide at a full scale\nSaturday evening dance.\nMembership was instituted to\ngive some sort of unity, rather\nthan exclusiveness, to the club.\nThis membership is open to all\nmembers of the College Union,\neven the Rupgby Club.\nImperial College Entertainments would be most interested\nto meet, or be told of, one person\nwho has been refused membership of the Plastic Fairy Tale.\nThe main advantage of the membership system, from the organisers point of view, is that it enables us to prevent the entry of\npeople who have already spoilt\nthe entertainment of the other\nmembers within the club. No\none, however, is prejudged when\napplying for membership.\nPerhaps I can finish by repeating the invitation given at the\nclose of the Plastic Fairy Tale,\nevery evening; any one who has\nany constructive ideas about the\nrunning of the Plastic Fairy Tale\nor entertainments in general,\nshould get in touch with the Entertainments Committee and we\nwill discuss them. We extend\nthis invitation to Colcutt of\ncourse.\nYours faithfully,\nG. SAGE,\nAsst. Sec, Ents. Committee.\narid\nmore Ents\nSir,\nColcutt's invidious remarks in\nthe last issue made me wonder\nhow he ever got into I.C. If he\nis unable to tell the differ e rence between Yak-hair and the hair of\nthe lesser Mongolian Yeti he\nshould cease to write on such\ntopics. (Who ever heard of a velvet-trimmed Yak anyhow )\nAs for his remarks about the\nPlastic Fairytale, he should have\nrealised that the easiest way to\nget people to come to something\nis to suggest that membership is\nrestricted. Nobody was refused\nadmission on the opening night,\nbut perhaps an exception can be\nmade in his case, just to make\npart of his article make sense.\nYours, etc.,\nKEITH GUY,\n(Chairman I.C. Ents.)\nP.S. \u2014 I.C.E. NTS=The Inhumane Colcutt for Entertainment.\nPolice attacked\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to Mr. Bland's letter\nin the last issue of Felix, I say\nlook at the bruises left by the\npolice on certain IC students.\nI 've witnessed enough unproved\npolice brutality at demonstrations\nin the past to know where the\nblame lies. Police riding on\nhorses with batons drawn into a crowd is ordered from above, not\ndecided at the time. I know the\nPeace Movement fairly well, and\nwe are not violent.\nMALCOLM DUCKETT.\nCOL CUT T My predecessor on this column had some chastening experiences : one or two were at ICWA hands (knees and ?). So I'm handing over to a group of fictional characters.\nThe scene : A Council Chamber. A Damoclean sword is suspended over all non-executive members who may dare to disagree\nwith the executive. The executive enters, like the devil, through a hole in the floor. They bear a gagged dummy representing ordinary\nUnion members.\nEnter, from the mouth of a suckling babe, a nymph like figure\ndisguised as Colcutt, who addressed his tiny audience.\nColcutt:\nToo long have you, through ignorance shielded\nNot known the power the exec, has wielded.\nThe exec, playing their self-appointed roles\nHave turned into miniature de Gaulles.\nWho,finding isolation easy,\nPlays his accordion in the Elysee.\nAnd is, Nerolike, amazed to see\nThe simple folks like you and me\nUninterested in what he pretends to be.\nHis isolation leads to apa the e. The President: As in Union meetings, I hope no one has anything\nto say.\nBob Mackman : Several planks in my election platform wood\nimprove the year rep. system and perhaps make them more powerful\nas a body.\nMartin Lack : If someone would give me the idea, I shall arrange\nto have Mackman shot as a rebel member of the exec.\nPete Ruhemann : (in triplicate) This could create problems.\nThis could create problems. This could create problems.\nSteve Mallinson : My text for today is far too long and complicated for me to quote at length. But I do think that we should not\nconsider ourselves here in council as an elite, merely as an oligarchy.\nIt is far simpler to make decisions in a committee, especially if one can\ncontrol that Committee oneself. It is ridiculous to expect 3,500 educated students to be able to make a decision. Far better, I should say,\nto keep the power where we want it. Let us in R.C. C. dispense our\nmoney as we wish but let it go no further. Where will it end if we\nintroduce student representatives to the decision makers of this Union?\nKeith Guy : While disagreeing with little that the exec, have done\nto disaffect I.C. students, I dislike the way in which they have gone\nabout it.\nThe President: Please defer your remarks, Mr. Guy.\nIan Wells : (a veritable mine of information): Hear, hear.\nGuy : Little things please little Mines. I have held my peace\nlong enough. I should like to say (flashes brilliant smile round\nCouncil!!) that the exec, should tell me when they wish to disillusion\nme. I appreciate their power and I know only too well that while\nthe Union should dictate to Council, who should dictate to the exec,\nit is the other way round. But I resent this interference with Ents.\nMeddle where else you like but don't meddle with me. (Guy here\ngoes white in face and Council hopefully waits for him to hit Phillips).\nThe President: Shall pass this on to my secretary.\nDave Harris : The Exec, is there to meddle; if council objects\nthey know what they can do about it. Nothing. We as the exec,\nconduct the day to day running of the Union. Look after the days and\nthe years will look after themselves. We keep the Union sufficiently\ndisorganised to make sure they don't lay a finger on us. We're on\ngood terms with the B.o.G.( Board of Governors\u2014Colcutt) and so\nwhat is the relevance of the rest of the Union. We give them their\nmoney back, weather and Jordan permitting, in the form of subsidies.\nPete Ruhemann : What is the nature of their subsidies ?\nThe President (now revealed as Ray Phillips): Money. No more\nruminating, please : I like Pete. (Council gathers round and chants\nwhile Phillips holds gagged dummy aloft.)\nWe believe that we are here\nTo act as I.C. Union's peers.\nThe Union should keep us in check\nBut up the Council and Exec. .\nThe three in one is two in three :\nIt's less for them and more for we.\nColcutt:\nThe essence of ths brief extract\nShows just how high the cards are stacked\nAgainst those who'd like to break in\nAnd break apart the magic ring\nHe, who's just passed the Colcutt buck\nTo me, stirred up a lot of muck\nI now should like to make a hit\nStirring up a load of ideas.\nSir,\nI am writing this letter to give\nthe lie to anyone who calls Imperial College \" a vast inhuman\nblock of super-powered brains.\"\nI have been kept away from my\nwork through illness for six\nweeks. During this time I have\nbeen deluged with letters, telephone calls and visitors, both\nfrom members of staff and fellow\nstudents.

I am writing\nto give a permanent record of\nthis quite spontaneous human\nresponse from people at all levels\nof the college.\nI regret that I have to abandon\nmy various permanent posts in an\neffort to catch up with my work,\nbut I do not want anyone to misinterpret this necessary resign a tion. I should point out that my\nillness was not due to overwork\nat IC, and I look forward to resuming active Union work if\npossible next term.\nYours faithfully,\nC.E.

FELIX\nCEDITOR'Somme nt The purpose of the three clubs committees, ACC, RCC, SCC, is\nconstitutionally said to be \" to sanction the formation of any relevant\nImperial College club for which there can be proved to be need and\nfacilities.\" On this basis there need only be the formation of an\nAnti-Social Clubs Committee (with a similar purpose in mind) before\nthe ardent group of \" Loo and Lift\" s crawlers may bt formed into\none of IC's most active clubs\u2014the facilities are undeniable and the\napparent need is becoming more and more obvious around the lifts\nand loos of IC .\nJust think how their activities could expand if given a small\nUnion grant and coherent leadership. They could arrange themselves\ninto years and departments\u2014spread throughout the college and\nblacken every lift and loo with obscenities, puns, rhymes and, best of\nall, just plain filth.\nOf course the interests of specialists could be developed by having\nspecial events weeks\u2014for instance they could start with an \"underwear\nweek\" when every member, under the guidance of an underwear\nspecialist, could go round the college writing \" knickers,\" \" slim line\nbra \" and, for lady members, \" jock straps \" all over the lift ceilings.\nThis could be followed by a joke week. Monday and Tuesday would\nof course be practice days for well worn puns, but, taking the Wednesday half holiday as an opportunity for giving tuition, members could\nadvance for the rest of the week into the more sophisticated field of\nLimericks.\nHell, the range is unlimited; they could progress from these to a lavatory joke week, sex week, anatomy week . . . the mind boggles.\nSo active they could become that in no time they would be\nestablished in the college and would justify being given a grant\nto go on tour\u2014where to? South Kensington, Bognor, Europe,\nDarkest Africa? Who knows how far the fingers of filth of the\nICLLSC could spread?\nCome on, you lift writing juveniles, pull yourselves together ; you\nare at University now not primary school. Defacing the lifts and\nlavatories around the college lowers the tone of the whole place,\nquite apart from demonstrating the warped and infantile minds of\nthose who do it.\nIC SURVEYS\nWe learn that the welfare officer intends to conduct yet another\nsurvey among the students of IC. This time the subject is to be student\nmoney. In principle this is a good idea as it not only gives a yardstick\nfor future generations but shows whether or not we need an increase\nunder the Government's expected review of the whole grant structure\n\u2014or does it?\nIn my first year at college the year rep. did a survey on our\nopinion of the course, the lecturers, the lab. periods and so on. One\nlecturer at least publicly denounced the results (which were not unfavourable to his course) as worthless because, he s^ id, the questions\nwere the wrong ones and they were asked in the wrong way. To us\nthe survey appeared thoroughly reasonable and likely to produce\nuseful results.\nIt is pertinent, then, to ask at this point if, when we produce a set of figures purporting to represent our financial state, they will be\naccepted by anyone but us. If we produce statistics to prove that\neach student needs an average increase of say \u00a32 per week, will the\nGovernment negate all the effort put into obtaining the figure by\nmaintaining that our sampling technique was inadequate?\nHowever expert the student interrogator may be, the fact remains\nthat he is an amateur\u2014the most damning of all crimes in the eyes of\nthe professional. Would it not be worthwhile to give this survey a greater prestige by consulting a firm of surveyors, such as Gallup or\nNOP\u2014even if they cannot improve our method, \" in consultation with\nat the bottom of the published work gives it a previously\nunheard of authority.\nNUS LOSE THEIR GRIP\nI understand that already this session UC have expressed serious disillusionment with the present administration of NUS and LSE only\nremain members through a last minute Union decision and intervention of their Director, Dr. Adams. The main cause for concern\nseems to be the fact that \u00a339,000 out of an NUS income of \u00a372,000\nis spent on staff salaries and the cost of several other administrative\nitems seems excessive.\nThis may well mean that the ULU will take on a new lease of life.\nIn the field of student complaints the trend still seems to be one of\nmass protests by significant bodies of students, and so, no longer\nhaving the NUS flag under which to march, it seems quite possible\nthat London Students will increasingly turn to ULU as the parent\nbody for their protests.\nWhether ICU would follow such a trend I doubt as we have been\nvery fixed in our autonomy for a long time, but for the smaller colleges\nand those nearer ULU, geographically and in spirit, The University\nUnion presents a convenient ready built body to which to switch their\nall eg ien ce.F HX Imperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel.

When\nthe A. A. amalgamates with I.C. its me hi be rs will officially become\nuniversity students. The University Grants Committee must then\nnecessarily meet the annual operating costs of the school and its 380\nundergraduates\u2014a total of approximately \u00a3210,000 per annum. It was\nhoped that the U.G.C. would also provide the initial capital for a new\nsite for the school\u2014on the I.C.\" campus,\" close to the Royal College\nof Art\u2014and the construction of a building to house the school. The\nsum required was estimated at \u00a3670,000, but due to the freeze and\nother considerations, the U.G.C. held back, and the situation was\ndeadlocked until August 1967. By this time the matter had acquired\nsome urgency. The lease on the Association's present premises\nexpires in mid-1972. Before accepting students for this academic year\n(the course takes five years) they had to be sure of a building to house\nthe school from 1972 on.\nThe situation has now been partially solved\u2014the U.G.C. have\nagreed to meet the annual running cost of the school, and to make a minor contribution to the cost of its new building. Where the rest of\nthe \u00a3670,000 is to come from is as yet unclear.\nAlan Lirtlewood, chairman of\nthe Architectural Association\nstudent body, photographed\nat a recent interview\nArchitectural Aethetes\nFirst impressions of the school\nare of an academy far removed\nfrom the impersonal efficiency\nthat characterizes the lecture\ntheatres and laboratories of I.C. Their present premises in Bedford\nSquare consist of a series of large\nrambling rooms, partitioned into\nworking sections by decaying\nbeaver board. Sartorially AA is\nyears ahead of I.C.'s dull display.\nThe attitude to work is somewhat\ndifferent and drawing boards tend\nto be lined with guitars and anti-LBJ posters rather than slide\nrules and logarithms. The sense\nof urgency and pressure so prevalent in I.C. lectures and; tutorials\n(particularly near June) is noticeably lacking. There are two important points to make about the\nschool. First, that it is much\nmore arts-oriented than one might\nexpect, the policy being that\nactual calculations and practical\napplication of ideas are best delegated to the engineer. Second,\nthat the school runs on the basis\nof staff-student equality to a degree unheard of in I.C. If the\nstudents feel dissatisfied with their\nlecturers and principal they can\nreadily apply pressure to dispose\nof them. But on the other hand,\nthe system pays dividends if the\nlecturers are worth their wage.\nuninformed\nThe students of the Architectectural Association are not overwhelmingly in favour of joining\nI.C. Alan Littlewood, the student chairman, in a recent interview with FELIX, said that this\nwas because they had not been\nsufficiently informed of the issues\nin question. \" I wish I could tell\nyou what our negotiating council\nis doing,\" he said. \"All they have\ngiven us is a deceiving silence. I don't think that they, are capable of negotiating efficiently with\nI.C.\" Deceiving silence or no,\nLittlewood's readily apparent\nconcern with the negotiations has\na point. The greatest asset of the\nschool is its informal organ iz a tion. Littlewood feels that when\nthe A. A. amalgamates with I.C. this informality and flexibility\nmay well be swallowed up in\nI.C.'s super-efficient teaching ma-chin e. He is against the idea of\ngiving permanent posts to the\nschool's teaching staff; this may\nwell come to pass with the transformation to University status,\nbut it would be a blow to the\nschool's staff-student equality.\nreluctant Union.\nThen there is the student union\nside of the merger. Littlewood\nsaid, \" I don't want to go out on a limb, but I want the school to\nhave complete say in what happens to the school's students' sub-script ions.\" It's indicative of the\ngeneral fear in the Architectural\nAssociation that when the amalgamation takes place, the A. A. will simply disappear into the\ncavernous maw of I.C. With this\nin mind, they would like to remain as autonomous as possible.\nAgain, there is a significant point\nbehind this. At present most of\nthe student subscriptions goes in\nhiring speakers to discuss extracurricular architecture, and there\nis no question of a massive clubs\nstructure such as there is at I.C. Presumably the A. A. would prefer to continue this way, rather\nthan drain resources into I.C. clubs. But in all fairness it seems\nan unrealistic attitude and raises\nquestions about places in Halls of\nResidence, membership of I.C.'s clubs, and even the right (gosh!)\nto eat at Mooney's emporia.\nGiven time, the A. A. will probably change their views. It would\nbe a great pity if they did not\u2014\nI.C. could only gain by joining\nwith 380 arts students. Whether\nthe A.

The people in the\ntube train were not amused and\none lady was prevented from getting off at one station by the sheer\nnumbers in the carriage. (You\nwill be pleased to hear that she\ngot off at the next station).

So went the first\nIC Council meeting on Monday, 6th November. However, closer\ninspection reveals that amid the many items of Ruhemacratic rubbish\n(termed after that famous IC bureaucrat)\u2014apparently so vital to the\nsmooth-run uni r.g of any self-respecting body\u2014there were in fact a number of issues that proved quite important.\nHaving quickly cleared min-ute s, matters arising and corre-sponde n ce, President Phillips\ncalled upon Dr. Ken Weale, the\nUnion Senior Treasurer, to present to Council the financial estimates for the coming session for\ntheir approval.\nExplaining that the delay in the\npresentation of last session's accounts was solely the fault of the\nprofessional auditor, from whom\nan apology (and assurance of\nspeedy action) had been obtained,\nDr. Weale went on to outline IC's expected turnover this session,\nhighlighting the change in system\nof grants for constituent colleges.\nHe proposed that in future each\nconstituent college should get 18s. per head instead of the old\namount of 15s. and that in addition RSM should get \u00a3500\u2014it\nused to be \u00a3400\u2014because they're\nonly little! He said that this was\nreally only an administrative\nchange, as from their grant the\nconstituent Colleges now could be\nexpected to cover all their costs\ninstead of the practice in recent\nyears of applying to Council for\nnumerous small supplementary\ngrants. The small increase of allowance to constituent colleges\nresulting from this adjustment\nwould, he said, put their share\nof the ICU expenditure up from\n14 per cent to 16 per cent.\nUnder discussion of these estimates Andy Jordan, one of the IC\nfloor reps., pointed out that the\nUnion was due to resume its\npolicy of putting aside money\neach year to cover the cost of refurnishing the Union premises.\nHe said that a working party set\nup in 1964 had reported that to\nrefurnish the Union above the\nlounge level (\ndue> last year),\nSouthside (due in 1972/3) and\nthe Union parts of the new College blocks (about 1979) would\ncost about \u00a340,000. lo achieve\nthis it would be necessary to invest \u00a32,500 each year from session 1967/68, by which time it\nwas expected that following the\nquin que n niu m the Universities\nGrants Committee (UGQ would\nhave raised the Union fee from\n\u00a34 to \u00a37 per head per annum.\nPriorities\nMr, Jordan went on to say that\nthe Union should get its priorities\nright because at present large\nitems of \"expenditure were favouring small groups of people\u2014he\ncited as examples the facts that\nthe Swimming Club got \u00a3160 to\ngo on tour, Soc. Soc. got given\n\u00a322 to send four members o a conference and the Gliding Club\nhad an annual grant of \u00a3400 for\n40 student members. He continued by saying that to wait until\nthe expected Union fee increase\nmaterialise d before improving our\nreserves was not acceptable, because although this increase\nwould bring the Union an extra\n\u00a39,000 per annum it was not unreasonable to suppose that the\ncost of living would rise by 3 per\ncent per annum or 30 per cent\nover the next 10 years, which is\nthe minimum time before which\nwe may expect a further increase\nof grant. This would mean that\nour current financial troubles\nwould recur for future generations if we relied upon them to\nbuild up our reserves from their\nfee increase.\nReserves\nIn reply to Mr. Jordan, Dr.\nWeale said that the Union reserves at the present stood at\n\u00a310,000 and that he did not think\nthat we would suffer by not investing this year as long as the\nexpected increase came within the\nnext two years. Dr. Weale pointed\nout that the College authorities\nmight take a dim view of our investing money this year as they\nhad just given us money to offset\nlast year's deficit.\nAndy Jordan then remarked\nthat the investment ^was for specific and necessary expenditure\nin the future and not just saving\nfor the hell of it\u2014and when this\noutlay became necessary it came\nin large quantized sums. To this\nDr. Weale replied that he would\nrather think of it coming \" intermittently in bursts.\"\nIn answer to questions from\nvarious members, Dr. Weale summed up by saying that the matter\nof an increased Union fee had\nbeen broached in 1963, agreed\nby the College in 1965 and was\ndue to emerge from the comp k x of quin que n ni al politics at any\ntime.\n\u00a31000 in year?\nTo conclude this discussion,\nMr. Jordan put a motion to council which read : \" that this council should take steps to ensure\nthat there was available at the end\nof the year \u00a31,000 to put into the\nUnion reserves.\" The r potion was\ndefeated, there being four in favour and a number of abs tensions. Continuing the review of the\nestimates, RCC and ACC were\ncalled upon by the Chairman of\nSCC to justify their increased\ngrant; in both cases it appeared\nthat the increases were solely the\nresult of inflation and had been\nTwo entertaining moments in a dull Morphy Day,\npower hits P.C.60, and Chris O 'Donnell recovers from a syrup pie.\nMORPHY DAY FUZZED\nparty offset by small economies in\nother directions. Mr. Lowin, another floor rep, then suggested\nthat council increase the amount\nallocated to buying newspapers as\nthis was a good way of attracting\nmembers to the Union. After\nsome discussion Martin Lack was\nrequested to investigate the possibility of re-allocating papers to\ngive more in the term and fewer\nin the vacations.\nA motion that Council accept\nthe estimates was then put and\npassed nem con.\nThe meat of the meeting seemingly now past, there followed\ntwo hours of \" discussion \" (to\nelevate the ensuing chit-chat and\npetty bickering to an almost un-recognisable plane) from which\nemerged little.\nFollowing a number of instances of failing communications,\nmainly between Ents Committee\nand the Executive, it was agreed\nthat in future a report of exec\nmeetings should be posted on the\nCouncil notice board.\nThe Silwood Park rep said that\nthe Research Assistant Union fee\nought to be paid by the College\nto encourage them to take an\nactive part in the Union (thus\nalleviating the problem of continuity at Silwood where most students are doing a one-year MSc\ncourse). After some discussion\nRay Phillips agreed to bring the\nmatter up with the Registrar.\nRex Lowin then reported that\nthere had recently been a meeting\nof the Rector's parking committee\nat which a figure of75 spaces for\nstudents' cars in College controlled areas had been agreed. Council instructed the exec and Messrs.\nLowin and Fryer (the Hall rep\non Council) to organise the allocation of these spaces and report\nthe system of selection used to\ncouncil.\nFinally, following a request\nfrom an obviously waning Mr.\nJordan that there be more frequent Council meetings to shorten\nthe proceedings, Ray Phillips\nclosed the meeting and repaired\nto a curry house and \" hostelry.\"\nThe future of Morphy Dav has been plunged into doubt after\nthe police intervention in this year's proceedings. It is hard to see\nhow it can carry on without several changes in its format.\nAs usual, the three Constituent College armies travelled down\nseparately, causing havoc to the traffic in South Kensington and the\narea of Putney bridge, and distress to travellers and railway staff on\nthe Underground system. However, before the R.C.S. contingent\nfinally arrived, the police had appeared in force and for bidder i. the\nbattle on the towpath to go ahead.\nBob Mackman, Chris O 'Donnell\nand Ian Wells tried arguing with\nthe police inspector who was apparently in control of the situ a tion, but could not prevail upon\nhim to ch n age his mind and let\nthe celebrations continue according to tradition. He took their\nnames and warned them that if\nany missiles were thrown, the offender or offenders could be\nbe charged with causing a breach\nof the peace and would be arrested immediately. A few\nminutes later a chief inspector arrived and repeated his sub or di nate's warning, adding that the\nflour bombs which people were\ncarrying vo ul d be described as\noffensive weapons and if any of\nthem were dropped on the tow j path, this would constitute an\noffence under the terms of the\nLitter Act. Eventually, after\nseveral minutes of pleading from\nthe presidents, he agreed to let\nthem throw custard pies at each\nother but steadfastly refused to\nallow anything else to take place.\nProvocation\nAccordingly, a tter explicit instructions to their followers not to\nengage in battle, the three presidents carried out the ancient\nritual, surrounded by a body of\npolice men. Most of the missiles\nwere then disposed of in the\nRiver Thames, but unfortunately\na few flour bombs landed in the\nvicinity of the members of Her\nMajesty's Constabulary and several of these gentlemen, including\nthe chief inspector, turned rather\npale. A few people were severely\nwarned for doing this but no further action was taken, and in\nfairness to the Putney Police, it\nmust be said that they acted with\ngreat restraint in the face of extreme provocation by I.C. stu-dents.\nAfter cheering the crews home\nin the boat races, a body of perhaps 500 students returned to\nSouth Kensington. Again the rush\nhour traffic w.:s continually held\nup on Putney Bridge and in Exhibition Road, where a small red\nM.G. was carried onto the road\nto block the traffic. One person\nwas carried off to a police'car in\nPrince Consort Road for swearing at the police but was released\nafter Mikj Tait intervened on his\nbehalf, the arresting officer, by\nthe way, using much more vehement language than that which\nhad caused the arrest. Officers\nfrom the \" Police Special Patrol \"\nthen broke up the ring-a ring-of\nroses around the Albert Hall,\nand the gathering dispersed\nquietly.\nIt seems that in future years the\npolice will be quick to clamp\ndown on Morphy Day activities\nas they were this year, so there\nseems little like li hod of it continuing in its present form. The inconvenience caused to members\nof the general public can only\nreflect badly on the students of\nI.C. and this inconvenience should\nbe minimized in future. Nobody\nreally wants Morphy Day to die\nout altogether, but the activities\nmay have to be drastically re-vised. The Constituent College\npresidents and vice-presidents intend to meet in the near future to\nreview the position and it is hoped\nthat they will come up with ideas\nthat will meet with the approval\nof the students while not alienating the police and public.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 3\nPrior peregrin at es around the Union\nThe times they are a 'changing. The time has come to inquire\njust why IC Union exists. Is it just an excuse to have two college\nbars, or is it possibly something a little deeper ?\nAs an entertainments centre it is splitting up; more people going\nto Southside and an already austere Union building becoming even\nmore stark and empty. With facilities, but not a substitute Union\nbu i luin g, available in the new college block, the physical d is embo di ment of a corporate union will be complete. Southside, although a very popular watering ground, does not possess the facilities of the\nUnion, and never will, so, with no real focus, will IC disintegrate into\na kind of cafe society, wandering from a Wells Soc. meeting in Mech.\nEng., to the Union for a game of darts, to the college block to lift a few weights, to Southside for a Nightcap? Or can enough excitement\nbe generated by the activities of the Union to retain an identity, a situation where the social facilities are regarded not merely in utilitarian fashion, but as a focal point. For this to materialise we need\nthat elusive ghost which has haunted I.C. for so long, \"an active\nUm \u00b0 n,..'. \u201e happening, he doesn't like to be\nBut what is an active Union? ie ft put. Then all you need, is an\nefficient organiser to farm out .the\nwork and keep people on their\ntoes. This is happening in Ents.\nthis year, but it should be happening everywhere.\nCheap Records\nA record shop will sell you an\nLP for the all-in bargain price of\n32/6. They buy them for about\n24/-, so they're making a fair\nprofit out of you. Now there are\nabout 3500 of us at IC and we\nspend a fair bit of bread on those\nblack pieces of plastic, so why\ndon't we get together and save\nourselves a little of that cash?\nFor students to go into the retail business is not at all unusual\nin the USA, so why not here? A small beginning, with just a small\ntable in, say, Southside lounge,\nmanned by volunteers with a small stock of records (most records could be obtained on order,\ndrop your order in a Southside\nroom and collect it 2 days later)\nis all that is necessary. Not only\ncould new records be sold, but\nstudents with discs they want to\nwave goodbye to could sell them\nhere. In addition it would act as\nan information centre. If we can\nprove a need for an idea like this,\nthen maybe we could get decent\nbacking from the Union, extend\nthe range of products available\nand put the thing on a permanent basis. Perhaps we could do\nsomething with the Southside\nexcuse-for-a shop at the same\ntime.\nSo, please, if there is anybody\nwho knows anything about the retail trade, or is prepared to help\nwith a venture of this kind, please\nget in touch with me via the Mech\nEng rack or accost me in the bar\nand then we can start things hap-pen ing. In the meantime, if anyone wants an LP for 25/- I can\nget them one, provided the demand is not too great.\nLES PRIOR\nContrary to popular belief, it is\nnot one in which a few union\nofficials work themselves impotent arranging ways of keeping\nthe masses happy throughout the\nyear. It possesses a number of\nattributes, not the least of which\nis that worthwhile things can happen there, but only if they are\nwell organised by a large number\nof people. It is also one where\nthe events relate rather better than\nat present to what is happening\noutside the college. Why, for instance is there no interest here in\nthe Arts and in creative work in\ngeneral? It is not because scientists are unable to appreciate the\nArts, they are just hung up.\nSo how do we bring them\ndown? Bigger and better general\nstudies lectures are not the ans-wer. The majority of IC students\nonly attend half a dozen lectures\nin their entire student life, they\nare only interested in something\nimmediately gro ov able on, and\nthis is what we must give them.\nFor example, few students would\nconsider it worthwhile going to a showing of recently made experimental films, but give them a competition for films made by IC\nstudents and this would automatically involve over 100 students\nwho would spread interest by\nword of mouth; give it maximum\npublicity, maybe even get that\nobnoxious instrument the popular\npress, to take notice; then show\nthe films along with other more\nprofessional examples, give the\npeople loud music, happenings\nand coffee to fill in the gaps and\nyou might have created something\nworthwhile at last.\nThe above example is of\ncourse, infeasible, but it does illustrate the organization and assistance required to put a show\nlike this on the road. That students are apathetic is nonsense,\nthey simply need to be invited to\nhelp rather more than at present,\nand once involved, they must be\ngiven something worthwhile to do.\nRemember, friendship is your\nbiggest weapon, if you give someone the idea that something is\nIC Words\nMr ICWA elected\nThe usually dull ICWA\ngeneral meeting was livened up\nlast Tuesday (November 7th) by\nthe Election of Mr. ICWA. The\ngentlemen were not allowed into\nthe meeting until other business\nhad been cleared ; they were\nmeanwhile entertained with a free pint in the Union bar. Perhaps this was why there were\nmore candidates than the nomination papers had hitherto\nshown. . There were in fact ten-candidates all longing to be Mr.\nICWA, all of whom swore that\nthey had been conned in to\nstanding while they were drunk.\nBefore the proposal speeches was\nthe usual display of knobbly\nknees. This was rather dull as\nthe only candidate suitably\ndressed was Ian Wells, who came\nclad in rug ger shirt and shorts.\nThe proposal speeches proved\nto be highly entertaining, even if\nsome were rather longer than\nJane Pearson would have liked.\nAfter the first paper ballot there\nwas a tie between Andy Vickerstaff and Pete Hall. After a further show of hands Pete Hall\nwas declared Mr. ICWA 1967/68.\nIt is interesting to note that Pete\nHall won the title \" King of Jez \"\nby virtue of his knobbly knees.\n(I am told that Butlin's run a similar contest if Mr. Hall should\ncare to turn professional). Although the election proved very\namusing it was not such fun as\nthose held at the ICWA party\nwhere cheers of support from\nmembers of ICWA helped to enliven the proceedings.\nICWA Carpet\nOn the subject of parties, it is\na great pity that because of the\nnew carpet they are not allowed\nto be held in the ICWA lounge.\nAt present members of ICWA\nhave no place in which to hold a GENTLEMEN w= MINES Freshers dinners are now all\nover, and Morphy Day is behind\nus. I was a pity that Mines did\nnot do as well in the races as had\nbeen hoped, but this was largely\ndue to unfair Guilds practice in\nusing an expert at stroke. However any disappointment felt by\nthe Minesmen ,at the tow-path\nfarce was quickly washed away\nthat evening in a superb Minesnight held at the Prospect of\nWhitby. About 40 men and a fair smattering of women, eventually pushed their way into the\nProspect and proceeded to consume quantities of beer, and to\nsmash their fair share of glasses\non the floor. Ian Wells considers\nthe night a complete success, as\nhe not only lost his voice sing-ing, but also managed to get arrested for causing a disturbance\nin the tube on the way home.\nOn the following night the\nRSM Association held their annual dinner. After a number of\nexcellent speeches, including one\nby Lord Tweedsmuir\u2014son of\nJohn Buchan, and some light refreshment in the Senior Common\nRoom, about 15 Minesmen repaired to the front of Royal College of Art, where they proceeded\nto sing a rousing Chorus of the\nMines chant to the Queen as she\nemerged from the building. The\nQueen smiled and the Dukr,, serious to begin with, smiled broadly\nand acknowledged with a wave.\nMr Wells is rather regretting\nhis move to re institute the post\nof Hon-Pornographer. After a lapse of several years, the post\nhas now been filled by Dave McNaughton. Dave assures us that\nbe has colle ced some very incriminating evidence on Ian and others\nafter the Mines Fresher-Women\ndinner, held on Tuesday 31st, which was enjoyed by all who\nwent.\nMACK MANIA Congratulations to Roger Webb\non becoming our new Honorary\nSecretary. As it only took two\nRCS General Committee meet-in gs, plus use of Presidential\nemergency powers by President\nBob Mackman for this simple\ntask, it will be interesting to see\nhow any really difficult business\nwill get done.\nThe main reasons are problems\nwith General Committee qu or a( vacancies for Secretary, Physics\nDepartment rep, Officer for academic affairs, plus a couple of\nmissing members rendered meetings in quo rate) and Malcolm\nparty; let us hope that the proposed cover for the carpet will be\nbought soon !\nBar Prices\nA lot has been said about increased bar prices, but no one\nhas yet pointed out that raising\nthe prices in Southside but not\nin the Union is unfair to the\nmembers of ICWA. Why should\nwe have no option but to pay 2d. extra per pint (yes, we do drink\npints). Quite often we are a ban donned by our male companions\nwho go in search of the cheaper\nbeer. Please don't say, \" Well,\nthere's the lounge bar,\" the atmosphere is dismal and anyway\nit isn't open every night. So I say put up the Union bar prices\nand lower the Southside prices.\nANITA FURNESS.\n'Twas down by the towpath one lunchtime in fall,\nContingents of students were set for a ball,\nWith bags full of flour and bags full of fruit.\nAnd the arms were completed by bags full of soot.\nThe boat n ce was started and battle was near,\nCustard pies at the ready\u2014but was the coast clear?\nTo be sure it was not for eight van loads of fuzz\nHad surrounded the towpath\u2014who gave them the buzz?\nThe inspector walked up to the Presidents three,\n\" You'll all be arrested if you fight now,\" quoth he,\n\" Throw your arms in the river and just clear away! \"\n\" We're just watching a boat race and we're here to stay! \"\nWe argue and argue and then compromise,\nThe only \" affray \" must be with custard pies,\nThat is the signal to all of I.C. Throw your arms in the river and go home to tea.\nWith a sickening squelch the custard pies struck,\nSome soot and some flour in the river we chuck.\nBut the smoke and the fumes they became so dense,\nWe can't see the river\u2014not even the fence.\nSo all thrown at random were soot, fruit and flour,\nBut random he ducked\u2014and now was the hour,\nStanding behind random was the inspector so grim,\nAnd the ammo was slung with vengeance at him.\n(Abrupt change in metre\u2014to show we're engineers)\nNow we come to the tragic bit,\nThere was no way of stopping it!\nThe cops no longer had clean kit,\nIt was covered all over in marmalade, marmalade, marmalade.\nAll that remains to be said about Morphy Day is that Guilds won\nboth races; and by two lengths in each case. Congratulations and\nmany thanks to our boat club Captain Neil McBride and his dedicated\ncrews.\nAnother big event in the Guilds calendar occurred on Sunday\nwith the annual London to Brighton run. For the seventh year in\nsuccession Bo again finished the course although slight trouble was\nexperienced in the shape of three punctures. However, Dr. Denton\nin the tender car fought his way through the traffic to our assistance\non every, occasion\u2014aided and abetted nobly by our two sports car\noutriders, Moore and Harris. Thanks are due to many Guildsmen\nin this venture : to those who turned out py jama clad to give Bo such\na superb send-off from Hyde Park; to those who went down to the\nmotor club lunch in Brighton (also attended by the owner and crew\nof the only other James and Browne known to exist\u2014a youngster\nof 1904!); to the back-room boys who helped prepare and polish Bo\n\u2014and most of all to our drivers Dave Knowles and Bill Mackey whose\ntremendous verve and co-or d in at ios, coupled with an admirable disregard in true pioneer spirit of petty traffic rules (like red lights, or\ndriving on the left!) enabled us to get to Brighton a mere hour behind\nschedule. Thanks very much to all concerned.\nNext big date in the future is the Guilds Rugger Sevens\u2014this\nSunday at Harlington. This is a really superb sporting social occasion\u2014we would like to see every year in every department put out\nat least one team ! The competitions is for the Hugh Ford Trophy, but\nlarge beer prizes are at stake. Support, particularly female, is very\nwelcome and coaches will run from the Union. All turn out for a great day!\n(Spooks) Duckett's strong views\non Mike Tait being given only\ntwo days' notice to leave Hall.\nHowever, on the academic front\nthings seem to be moving. We've\ngot an Officer for academic af-fairs, Mr. Wield, who was elected\nunopposed. Which brings us to\nthe next point. R.C.S. is going\nto get a management study\ncourse, or at least a SociologyEconomics one. On an experimental basis, ten lectures or so\nare going to be given his year, and\nif these are a success, R.C.S. may\nbe included in the general College - Sociology - Economics - Psychology Course now given to\nMines and Guilds. The idea is: \u2014\n\" To introduce the concepts of\nthe Social Sciences and show how\nthey can be applied to the systematic analysis of the economic\nand sociological environment in\nwhich decisions have to be made\nin industry, and to the understanding of people working at all\nlevels in industrial and governmental and academic organisations.\" If you are interested, watch\nthis column and come and join in\ndiscussion in the next Union\nmeeting.\nI am informed that at the moment the R.

Although the\nground was very slippery it was\ngreat credit to Arthur Loveday,\nthe groundsman, that the game\nwas played at all.

In two quick\nraids in the middle of the second\nhalf Ian Tasney and Mike Pratt\nscored to give a very spirited IC\nvictory.\nWOMANS HOCKEY I.C.4 King's College 0\nOn Saturday, our undefeated\nteam travelled down to Mitcham\nin pouring rain feeling sure that\nthe pitch would never be fit for\n\u00ab match after a week of continuous rain. Fortunately the opposition were even, more convinced and two of them just\ndidn't bother to turn up. Our\ntask was not a difficult one.\nWith our own solid defence, we\nwere able to concentrate on finding the holes in theirs. Despite\nseveral missed opportunities, four\ngoals were scored and eleven\nrain-soaked but victorious\nplayers dashed off the pitch for\nthe hot showers.\nMIXED\nHOCKEY I.C.2 \u2014Essex University 0\nI.C.6 \u2014Heston 1\nThe I.C.. Mixed Hockey team\nplayed fast and skilfully against\nan erratic and often dangerous\nHeston team; one Icwarian has a shiner to prove it, and another a suspected chipped bone! But the\ngirls were not the only ones to\nsuffer In this match as the goalkeeper made one of the best saves\nof the season; half-way across the\nD she headed the ball in a manner\nwhich would, have done credit to\nDave Mackay.

Nelder, Physics III.\nG. NELDER\n(Captain).\nCross Country\nwin league\nrace\nImperial College won the\nLondon Colleges cross-country\nleague race at Borough Road\ncollege last Wednesday. Over a muddy course of four and i a quarter miles the race was run at\na fast pace which suited our team\nwho gained second,! seventh,\neigth, fifteenth and sixteenth\nplaces. This was good enough to\nwin by nine points. The second\nteam showed C's strength in\ndept by finishing eighth out er f fourteen, beating many other col-leg e's first teams. Although we won this race, the\nfirst tea ah is still lying in second\nplace and is determined to beat\nthe \"professional\" Borough Road\nteam.\nASHLEY DEANS.\nGuilds lead Min nia Ifce Morphy race\nLine out at Harlington. IC Extra 1st against Oxford \"A\" Soccer\n2nd XI Trounce\nGoldsmiths\nAfter a disappointing start to\nthe season the second XI has\nfinally struck true form, now that\na reasonably settled team has\nbeen established.\nWith their only previous victories being in the two league\nmatches against Q.M. C. II and\nUC. II, the victory against Goldsmiths II last Saturday took IC\nII to the top of their division in\nthe U.L. League. This match\nproved to be a rout with IC winning 9-0, goals being scored by A. Richards, A. Ebbutt (2), M. Whittle (3) and three own goals\nfrom the Goldsmiths full-backs.\nThe seconds, followed this victory with another good 3-1 win\nagainst Portsmouth Tech II on\nWednesday. IC came off as worthy winners with three good goals\nscored by F. Coldwell, B. Hall\nand A. Lafferty.\nThe rest of the season looks\nvery promising for this Second XI\nand it is pleasing to note that so\nmany of this team could confidently step into a First XI place\nif called upon.\n' A successful day at Harlington\nwas ensured last Wednesday, with\nthe First XI drawing 2-2 against a very strong Portsmouth side; the\nFourth XI beating Kings 3rd XI\n1-0 and the 7th XI beating L. S.E.5th XI 5-2.\nStarting favourites in both\nraces, Guilds duly won the Morphy and Lowry Cups, their\nseventh double in ten years. The\nGuilds crew, with two inter-nationals, let from the start in the\nMorphy race. After one minute\nMines were trailing by one\nlength with RCS a further three-quarters length back. After two\nminutes Mines spurted to go\nclear of RCS and overlap Guilds,\nbut the latter went smoothly\naway to a1| length lead which\nwas maintained until the last\nfew strokes when Mines fell\nback. Final result was 1 Guilds,\n2 Mines, 3 RCS, distances 2\nlengths and 2 lengths.\nIn the Lowry race, a piece ot\nopportunist co xing by Mines\ntook them away to a one length\nlead at the start. Guilds started\nslowly but soon overhauled RCS\nan d then Mines. Mines hung on\ngamely to the boat house but then\nblew up and trailed in two\nlengths behind. Final result:\n1 Guilds, 2 Mines, 3 RCS, distances 2 lengths and 4 lengths.\nWinning crews : Morphy : Bow,\nR.N. BcBride ; 2, M.J. Wrigley ;\n3, P.A. Lowe ; 4, R.A. Vernon ;\n5, R.I. Allum; 6, T.P.

Although maintaining a territorial advantage it\nwas only an excellent penalty\ngoal by John Lum which gave\nus a30 advantage at half-time.\nIn the second half the sense of\nurgency increased and towards\nthe end we ran in two tries by\nDave Bell and Bob Pine, one\nbeing converted by John Lum.\nBoth tries were built on very\ngood forward domination \u2014\u2022 a rare achievement against such a good side.\nThe Ex 1st XV have been\nplaying very well indeed, losing\nonly 5-6 to Rosslyn Park Roebucks due to a last minute try,\nlast Saturday, and beating a strong Wasps XV 15-0 this\nSaturday.\nOnce again, in the interests of\nthe smooth running of the club,\nI would appeal to everyone to\nconsult the team lists regularly as\nchanges have been made as late\nas Friday lunchtime.\nTHE STORYSOFAR.\nRpmes\nHAD SETTLED\nDOWN TO THE (\n9 to 5 DRX/DG\u00a3gy\nOF TECHNICAL\nCOLLEGE LIFE.\nIT\nWASN'T QUITE\nWHAT HE\nEXPECTED^ SO\nTHE APATHETIC\nROT SET IM....\nROINES\nr so You \"v^ THINK THIS\nCARTOON IS\nqo/NG TO END WITH ME FLAT\nON MY BACK ? \u2022\nWELL, YOU'RE\nLEAD ff J GH T/'I 'VE FIIJISHBD ALL\nMY PROBLEM SHEETS\nREPORTS....

Ion nt au, in newly polished spl en dour, was driven out under the careful guidance of Dave Knowles\n(driver) and William Mackey (co-driver).\nAn attempt was about to be made (What do you mean, we've\ndone it every year since the war) on the great feat in all vintage car\nlives\u2014the London-Brighton run, (1967).\nA reckless drive of about 400\n%W JjPS\nte w \u2022\n\u2022\nyards to Hyde Park followed and,\nscattering the crowds in all directions, Bo arrived at the starting\ngrid to be greeted by about forty\njoyous City and Guilds students\nclad, as tradition has it, in py-jam as, and one rather less joyous\nRAC official (\" not quite so fast\nthere, please !\")\nAt 8.25, or thereabouts, Bo was\noff, and by the time it reached\nPark Lane it had already overtaken everyone else in its group\n(even though most of them had\nleft a few minutes earlier) and\nwas going really well down Constitution Hill, along the Mall, and\nby the time it reached Westminster Bridge it was already\ncatching up the stragglers of the\ngroup that had left earlier. Unfortunately a traffic jam had\nformed on Westminster Bridge;\nstill, no trouble\u2014over on the right\nhand side of the keep left signs,\nover a set of red lights and we\nwere through round the corner on\ntwo wheels and straight past the\ntender car which was carrying\ntools, spares and your intrepid\nFELIX reporter.\nBlow out\nAll went well for the next two\nmiles until, on a sharp right hand\nbend (well, they are all sharp if\nyou go round on the wrong side\nof the road) with a satisfying bang\n(It's the best way to go, says the\ndriver), a rear tyre blew out. Still\nno matter, out came the jack and\nnew inner tube, off came the tyre,\nback on and inflated with the foot\npump within 16 minutes (was that\nProf. Ford I saw on the foot\npump just then?\u2014no, surely not).\nAway we went again, flat out to\nmake up lost time. Suddenly, at\na cross roads, some maniac in a modern car came across in front\nof us (What was that? The lights\nwere red our way? You must be\ncolour blind). Bo was going too\nfast to brake (well, the foot brake used to work mate, but you know\nhow things go) and we were\nforced to swerve up the road at\nright angles to the intended\ncourse. A quick reverse and we\nwere back on our way.\nFuel Pump\nUp Brixton Hill the engine\nstarted running rough and eventually stopped. What was the\ntrouble? nothing serious. Who\nturned the fuel tap off? Never\nmind, must have been the vibrations. Off once again, through a few more red lights and we had\nmade up 10 of the 15 minutes lost\nby the wheel change. A few more\nmiles and the fuel tap was turning\nitself off again. Out leaned the\n\u2014 mind that car in front \u2014 co-driver. Too late, up another Side\nstreet to avoid collision and back\non to the road again.\nAbout another hour, and Gatwick was passed and about two\nmiles further on another pun c ture; this time the inner tube was\nall chewed up. Could it be\n\" whilst accelerating away from\ntraffic lights \"\u2014quote from\ndriver, could it be \"constantly\ngoing round - corners with the\nwheels on the wrong lock \"-quote\nco-driver. Where has that tender\ncar got to? about ten minutes\nlater it caught up, the inner tube\nhaving ben mended by your\nFELIX reporter (\" I hear he's from RCS.\u2014No, impossible\"),\nanother 15 minutes and the new\ntyre was on (Was that President\nChris O 'Donnell I saw on the foot\npump? Surely not).\nStopped\nAway again and afer a few\nmiles on the wrong side of the\nroad we were flagged down by a policeman (What were those\nsigns we had been making? Well,\nofficer, they mean we've got two\nBo\u2014Brighton Bound\ncylinders.)\nSuddenly, another blow-out,\nsame tyre. (You sure he's from\nRCS?). The only inner tube left\nhad no valve, still, get Chris to\npump it up to some fantastic\npressure and bung on a dust cap,\nthat should hold it. If not, fill it\nup with newspapers and old\ncomes of FELIX and thine s. Then away again, more slowly\nthis time with only 18 miles to go.\nFinding the tyre was holding the\ndriver increased speed\u201445 mph\ndown hills, 30 mph on the flat\n(Who said the speed limit for the\nrun is 20 mph? Never mind,\nyou can't hold a good car down.)\nPhoto G. Marshall\nSuccess\nNearer and nearer came\nBrighton and thicker and thicker\nbecame the traffic (What's that,\nOfficer, we can't form a4 th lane\non a three lane road, Sorry) but\nvaliant efforts from the driver got\nus through (Prof. Ford, have you\nany comments to make about the\ndriving? Ford: \" It left me petrified \") and still running as ever in\ncame Bo at 12.25. We had made\nit again.\nUp went Prof. Ford to get the\nmedal (only bronze, after all that\ntrouble ?) and off went the crew\nand the band of loyal City and\nGuilds supporters who had come\ndown by coach, off to a celebration dinner at a well-known hotel\n(send the bill to FELIX'please)\nand a few (who said a few?)\ndrinks.\nGUESTS IN HALL\nThe Tizard Hall Committee\nhas suggested a scheme whereby\nthe arrangements for hall residents having guests to stay at\nweekends could be considerably\nimproved; so far it has failed to\nmeet with the approval of the\nHalls of Residence Representatives Committee.\nAt present any resident who\nhas a guest coming has to wait\nuntil the Friday morning before\nthe weekend to see if there are\nany ;guest rooms available and\nthere are usually insufficient. The\nHall rules state that anybody who\nis going to be away for a weekend\nmust inform the housekeeper so\nthat his room can be used as a guest-room if necessary. For this\nthe occupant gets nothing but the\nknowledge that somebody else\nwill be using his room, that he\nhas only one small drawer that\ncan be locked and that he'll have\nto put away the po sessions that\nhe has around the room.\nMany people want to have a guest at some time during the\nyear and want to know reasonably well in advance if a room\nwill be available, the present arrangements don't seem to satisfy\nsome of them and this has resulted in the not uncommon presence of guests in rooms illegally.\nThe Tizard suggestion is that\na Hall should buy a small number\nof camp-beds that residents might\nhire to erect in their rooms when\nthey have a guest at weekends.\nThere would be regulations under\nwhich residents would supply details of the guest to the housekeeper or Sub-Warden in advance\nand the housekeeper's or SubWarden's permission should be\ngiven before a camp-bed was\nmade available. This system has\nbeen used successfully in the University of Keele and elsewhere.\nIt would, (for the present at\nleast!) apply to male guests only.\nThis proposal is meant as an\nextension of the present arrangements for guests in Hall, rather\nthan the institution of a\" free for\nall\" for guests. It is meant to\ncater for those who have occasional guests from home or other\nuniversities and not for those\nwhose mates live in digs in Wimbledon and would like to hit the\nI.C. scene all weekend.\nSurvey\nRex Lowin, IC welfare officer,\nannounced at the council meeting that in anticipation of an\nattempt by the Government\nto introduce loans to stu-dents, he intended to conduct\na survey in IC to ascertain how\nthe means test affects us\u2014what\nour average income is\u2014and how\nmuch we spend on essentials.\nAs he says although this may\nnot much affect the present\ngeneration, it will give a yardstick\nagainst which future students\nmay compare their grants.\nRex urges the fullest co-opera-tion in this survey, as it is only\nby a large response that any relevant figures may be obtained.\nPREGNANCY\nTEST SERVICE\nResults by return.

Every week there appears vast\nquantities of free, disposable,\nscrap paper called SENNET. In\nview of the regular appearance of\nthis litter, which admits to origins\nat ULU, we thought that an investigation could profitably be\nmade while our representative\nwas there on other business.\nInquiry at the messenger's desk\nin ULU brought him sympathetic\n(or merely contemptuous?) looks\nand directions to the depths of the\nULU building, where he eventually found an apologetic looking\ndoor bearing the words \" SENNET OFFICE.\" Bracing himself for the expected squalor, he\nentered and was amazed to find\nthe minute room immaculate.\nSeated at one of the decrepit\n(even by Felix standards) typewriters was a willing female who\noptimistically propositioned him\n. . . about joining the SENNET\nstaff. Apparently un dismayed by\na polite refusal she proceeded, not\ntoo subtly, to try to extract information about I.C. and met\nwith resounding failure. However,\nprompted by an upsurge of goodwill he volunteered to give our\nailing rival a helping hand for a few moments and was soon\npounding away on the above-mentioned typewriter, shocked to\nfind that the only available paper\nwas the reverse sides of used\nsheets, while carbon copies were\nunknown. At least this explained\nthe tidy ness \u2014there wasn't even\nenough scrap paper to make a mess.\nBefore leaving he learnt that\nthe cause of this shortage was the\ninadequate financial support received from ULU. One wonders\nhow anyone can possibly be expected to produce a newspaper\nunder these conditions and, even\nthough their product isn't the ultimate in student journalism, how\nfrustrated the hardworking staff\nof SENNET must be.\nQuotes of the Fortnight\nQUOTES :\nEbdon : When are they going to make Mooney \" What's Off \" editor?\nWhat's On editor : Oh no, I can't compete with Mooney,\nRedmayne (of Ebdon): That's rather nice.\nPete Hall: \" My knees have been overexposed recently.
