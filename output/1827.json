Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a big enjoyer of the\nindie-pop giants, but this Finsbury Park crowd was\nteetering on the obsessed super-fan side, I was\nscared. The lineup was exciting with huge names\nlike Cigarettes After Sex and Bleachers also on the\nlist - it was set to be a great day for music.\nWe settled in as Pretty Sick opened with a fine\nset, nothing to write home about really. The guitarist was the most entertaining to watch, squeezing\nevery possible drop of tone out of his guitar. With\nhim was a competent singer and a great drummer.\nGenerally though, their energy was lacking and it\nseemed like they wanted us to win them over rather than the other way round, but the music was\ngood. The highlight was definitely their final song\n\u2018Dumb\u2019 as the majority of the crowd knew this one\nand that injected a temporary boost of energy into\nus.\nAs they left the stage, a silence befell the park\n- the early July sun was strong, all the carefully applied eyeliner was beginning to melt, and the alt\nTumblr crowd around us were dropping like flies.\nWe desperately needed someone on stage, and\nsomeone good.\nAs if in answer to my prayers, four middle-aged\nmen humbly took to the stage. To the untrained\neye, it would have looked like a bunch of dads\npicked up some instruments, but to me, I knew my\nears were about to be blessed by the godfathers of\nMidwest emo, and you could not contain my excite-ment. The 1975 demographic however were generally not as excited as my group, it was clearly not a\nfantastic fit for American Football to be performing alongside the Dirty Hit folks, but there were\na few pockets of anticipatory chatter around us\nwhich just added to the atmosphere. Their sound\ncheck was lengthy, but that\u2019s understandable \u2013 after all you can\u2019t rush greatness.\nEventually it ended and they were ready! They\nopened their set with \u2018Stay Home\u2019 a melodic, at-mospheric, mainly instrumental track, with a scattering of repeated, mumbled lyrics, easing us nicely into their more polished, laid-back sound after\nthe grungier Pretty Sick set. It was at this point\nthat I began to cry, I guess it was just overwhelming watching the band that popularised my favourite genre almost two decades on from their debut\nalbum, but it\u2019s also not the first time I\u2019ve cried at\na gig so maybe I should just start taking tissues.\nNext was \u2018The One With The Wurlitzer\u2019, an American Football essential, featuring drummer Steve\nLamos on the trumpet. I could tell this one was going to be challenging for the crowd, with interesting chords and piercing trumpet accidentals, it\u2019s\nan acquired taste for sure.\nHaving opened with more instrumental songs,\n\u2018Silhouettes\u2019 was a welcome introduction to frontman Mike Kinsella\u2019s singing voice, steady and\nspeech-like, supported by his cousin Nate\u2019s harmonies - it started with a whopping three glockenspiels layering cascading rhythms, a really\nimpressive piece. I was blown away by just how\nidentical the live versions were to the recordings.\nThroughout their set, not a single one of them uttered a word, letting the music speak for itself and\nshrouding the band in a delicious mystery.\nThen out came a guest singer in place of Paramore\u2019s Hayley Williams for their collaboration\n\u2018Uncomfortably Numb\u2019. The levels were a little\nstrange for this one, with Mike\u2019s voice overpowering his counterpart\u2019s but it was a crowd favourite,\nslightly more upbeat and singable than the previous songs. Kudos to the sound team for getting the\nvolume of Nate Kinsella\u2019s bass just right, the band\u2019s\ntwinkly guitar riffs and funky drums are tied together perfectly by his interesting rhythms and\ncarefully selected intervals and it was important to\ngive the bass enough weight.\nAt this point in the set, groups in the crowd were\nbeginning to lose interest, I guess if you don\u2019t know\ntheir music, it\u2019s quite challenging to get into it,\nespecially live, due to its slower, more emotional\nnature. People were beginning to sit down around\nme, no way to treat emo royalty \u2013 but don\u2019t get me\nstarted on the state of concert etiquette nowadays.\nLuckily for them, the set was winding to a close\nand the recognisable opening riff of \u2018Never Meant\u2019\nemanated from Steve Holmes\u2019 guitar. Instantly, I\nsaw about 100 phones shoot up in front of me to\ncapture the iconic riff, I can\u2019t judge, I too immortalised it on my Instagram story (sorry followers).\nWith that, Mike stepped up to the mic, uttered a\nquiet \u2018thank you\u2019, and that was it. Who knew how\nlong I\u2019d have to wait to see them in England again?\nAmerican Football: Enough said\nMusicWriter\nAMANDA PAUL\nMUSIC\nAs if in answer to my\nprayers, four middle-aged\nmen humbly took to the\nstage.\n\u201c\n\n"

Refusing to confine itself to a single category, it\nhosts club nights, drag brunch, movie nights, and even a caf\u00e9,\ncovering you for every occasion. When I think about what\nmakes me want to come back, it\u2019s not necessarily specific aspects of the events, but the people it has brought together,\nthe atmosphere and sense of community it creates.\nRetroCaf\u00e92.0\nSW6 6BS, Fulham\nTucked away on trusty\nMunsterRoad,thisquaintcaf\u00e9\nwas opened by rock and blues\nlover Andy with the dream of\nhaving a welcoming source\nof coffee and pastries in the\ndaytime, that transforms\ninto a live music bar by night\n(once you shift the couch a\nbit and bring a few stools and\namps). Sit with a book (or your\nlectures, Imperial, gosh) on a\ncouch under the low-hanging\nAmerican diner-inspired\nlamps and enjoy Andy\u2019s\n\u201860s/\u201970s folk rock selections:\nSimon & Garfunkel, Joan\nBaez, Fleetwood Mac, you get\nthe gist. Tara rewarded her\nworking week with an aged\nbeef burger on Friday nights\nwhile enjoying Niall Kelly\u2019s\nunparalleled blues renditions:\na combination of cheer,\nchortle and chills. You\u2019ll never\nhear anything like it.\nBluesKitchen\nNW1 7JN, Camden\nBlues Kitchen, also in Brixton and Shoreditch, is our default live funk and soul\nclub night host. Go on a Friday or (and) Saturday for a late night boogie. Go on\na Wednesday night for half price cocktails (and a boogie). Arrive before 9 PM\nfor free entry, but we would recommend booking a table if you intend on having\na slightly costly bite: wings, (fucking delectable) burgers, milkshakes \u2013 did we\nmention cocktails? A classy crowd, a classy house band, and a classy place.\nTara favours the Brixton chapter because there\u2019s a whole floor dedicated to\ndancing (and you can avoid the Camden crowd). So. Much. BOOGIE.\nSlug@The\nRedback\nSW6 5NH, Fulham\nYou will develop a toxic\nrelationship with Slug.\nThe playlist is essentially\nunchanged since Joe\u2019s first\ntrip over years ago but sadly\nthe \u00a32.50 Jagers are a relic of\nthe past. When he last went,\nthey were a hefty \u00a32.70. Do\nnot enter this place unless it\u2019s\na Wednesday night otherwise\nthe only other people there\nwill be underage locals and\nsome concerningly old men.\nDo not enter this place sober,\nyou\u2019ll see past the fa\u00e7ade and\nwill want to leave immediately.\nMost importantly, do not enter\nthis place expecting anything\nother than sweaty mediocrity\nthen you\u2019re going to be\npleased because it\u2019s actually a\nfun night. It\u2019s crowded but you\nsee everyone you know. The\nmusic is the same every week\nbut they\u2019re all good singalong\nsongs. You\u2019ll hate yourself the\nmorning after as you drag\nyourself to a 9 AM lab session\nbut it was worth it.\nInfernos\nSW4 7UH, Clapham\nJoe has no memory inside of Infernos and maybe that\u2019s for the\nbest. The only thing he can recall is there being a floor-to-ceil-ing fish tank on one of the walls. If anyone makes the trip to the\ndepths of Clapham, please let us know if this is true or if he hal-lucinated. The place is full of the usual Clapham types - but the\nmusic is fun, cheesy pop so as long as you\u2019re adequately prepared (thank you, Aldi wine), you\u2019ll love it.\nWhiteHeatClub@\nTheLexington\nN1 9JB, Islington\nOne of the better Indie club nights in London with free entry on Dice before 11:45 (get\nthe Dice app, if you\u2019re looking for gigs to go to as well). Be warned, it might be empty\nuntil 12 but stick it out and I promise it picks up into a good night. There\u2019s a bar downstairs that you can go back down to once you have your free stamp so chill down there\nuntil it gets busier upstairs. Once it does, this is one of my favourite nights out in London, playing hits from Jamie T and The Strokes to The Cure and LCD Soundsystem.\nMinistryofSound\nSE1 6DP, Elephant & Castle\nThe Ministry of Sound club in Elephant and Castle caters to diverse\ncrowds, perfect for those appreciative of different sub-genres of electronic dance music. The club comprises of four rooms, each presenting\nwith different music genres including house, techno, trance, and drum\n\u2018n\u2019 bass. They host many events and rave parties, and have Milkshake\nstudent nights every Tuesday. Ministry of Sound is great for casual club\nnights or full-on raves, and generally stays open till 5-6 AM. It\u2019s not the\nfanciest of clubs to go to, and does get quite hot and stuffy, but the DJs\nand liveliness really make up for it. There is an outdoor area with benches and food stalls, which is nice for socializing with other students. They\nare very strict about final entry, so make sure you get there on time otherwise you will be denied entry!\nHeaven@G-A-Y\nWC2N 6NG, Embankment\nIf you\u2019re looking for a starter gay club, this place is for you. Playing slay pop girly hits from\nthe \u201880s to now, it\u2019s a great place to get your boogie on and dance the night away. However\nif you\u2019re looking to meet other LGBTQ+ people, TURN AROUND! The place has too high a\nconcentration of straight men trying to flirt with gay women.\nOthers to\nCheck Out\nScala\nTroxy\nThe Jazz Caf\u00e9\nE1\nThe Windmill\nCaf\u00e9 1001\nPhonox\nTroubadour\nMap Studio\nCaf\u00e9\nNext Door\nRecords\nSebright Arms\nGremois\nUnderworld\nFabric\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n24 | Film 29 september 2023\nI\nf you were to go ahead and google the\nmost recent quirky, occult-spooky,\nwacky or slightly boring movie that\nyou watched in the cinema, there\u2019s a\npretty good chance that it was distributed by A24. Despite only being founded\n11 years ago, the output of the studio has\ngenerated sixteen Academy Awards, including two Best Pictures (Moonlight and\nEverything Everywhere All At Once). Their\nstatus as an \u2018indie\u2019 film studio is getting\npretty debateable to say the least.\nSo what gives? All the oldheads of\nHollywood and NY Times journalists have\nbeen telling us that cinema has been lying dead and buried at the bottom of a\npile of Disney dollars for the last decade\nat least. How did A24 manage to grow so\nquickly whilst only selling tickets to people that like to call movies \u2018films\u2019? Well,\nfirst and foremost because that isn\u2019t really true \u2013 at least not anymore. A24 might\nhave started outside of the sphere of\n\u2018mainstream\u2019 audiences, but Everything\nEverywhere grossed over $140 million.\nThe stated aim of the studio at its founding was to attract the new online generation away from summer blockbusters,\ntoward films where directors and writers\nwere given more artistic liberty. Coming\nout of the back of the recession era of the\nlate 2010s, A24 saw a vacuum for that\nsort of studio and made their home in it.\nThat unique offering, combined with\neither a shrewd eye for picking diamonds from the rough or a significant\namount of luck, enabled A24 to build a\nloyal following amongst both consumers\nand filmmakers. Personally, I think no\nsmall part of their success is due to their\npartnership with Ari Aster, director of\nHereditary and Midsommar and one of the\nexperts spearheading the modern, surprisingly popular horror genre. Out of all\nA24\u2019s films (bar Moonlight and Everything\nEverywhere), those are the ones that I\u2019ve\nheard people talking about the most,\nregardless of whether they\u2019d claim to be\n\u2018film fans\u2019. Maybe something about films\nlike that enables them to break out of\nthe potentially unappealing dullness or\naloof-ness that people might usually associate with \u2018arthouse\u2019 cinema.\nTheir reputation for quirky or left-field\nfilms has led fans and critics alike to coin\n\u2018A24\u2019 as a genre in and of itself. Whether\nthat will help or limit their success in the\nfuture remains to be seen, but after this\nyear\u2019s Academy Awards, they\u2019ve certainly established themselves as a Hollywood\nmain player.\nThe A24 formula\nFILM\nFilmWriter\nJONAH HEWETT\nA24 logo design sketch. GrandArmy\nA\nfew weeks ago, a friend and I sat down to watch\nCitizen Kane for the first time. I wasn\u2019t sure what\nto expect \u2013 everyone knows it as \u2018the best film ever\nmade\u2019, to the point that it\u2019s become a joke, especially because you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find someone who has actually watched it these days. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t even\nsure what it was about \u2013 I thought it was some kind of\n1940s crime drama, because I semi-consciously associated the name with the fairly unsuccessful 2010 videogame Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days, which is rife with criminal activity. Oddly enough, it isn\u2019t that \u2013 it\u2019s a two-hour\nchronicle of the life of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster\nKane, a fictional character partly woven from several\ncontemporary influential media moguls of the late 19th\nand early 20th\ncentury. Citizen Kane begins by dramatically and cryptically killing its main character, and then\nlaunches into an energetic \u201840s newsreel that describes\nhis entire life \u2013 and the events of the film \u2013 in sensational detail. Suddenly the newsreel ends, and we see a shadowed room, punctuated only by two shafts of light and a\ncascade of overlapping conversation from the men creating the newsreel, their silhouettes barely outlined in\nthe gloom. Then exterior, night-time, the roof of a club.\nThe camera moves up and over the skylight, framing the\nwoman slumped lonely over one of the empty tables,\nthen descends through the roof and pulls in close. Citizen Kane has thus far zipped through several genres and\na myriad of cutting-edge filmmaking techniques that\nwould have been exponentially more difficult to pull off\nback then, and we\u2019re not even fifteen minutes into the\nfilm. People say old movies are slow and boring because\nthey often are. But now imagine you\u2019re in the audience\nin 1941, and the last film you watched in the theatre was\nGone with The Wind, and you\u2019ve just watched those four\nopening scenes. The linear structure and lingering dia-CitizenKaneis\nactuallyprettygood?\nFilmWriter\nJONAH HEWETT\nA24 partial filmography in a collage. Mike Buzadji\n\n"

From\n10p standing tickets at the Royal Court\nTheatre to \u00a35 tickets at the National Theatre to DramSoc socials, there\u2019s almost\ntoo much choice.\nSpeaking of DramSoc, I can personally attest that being part of the messy fun\nthat is a bunch of STEM students totally\nin charge of bringing the Arts to life was\na game-changer during first year.

A\ngaping hole is left in the lives of those of\nus who haven\u2019t been fortunate enough to\nsecure internships. Histrionics aside, reading is an excellent way to fill the free time;\ncatching up on novels and non-fiction titles\nalike. Below are brief reviews of five books\nI\u2019ve completed over the summer holidays.\nBefore the Coffee Gets Cold\nby Toshikazu Kawaguchi\nKawaguchi\u2019s novel adaptation of his\nplay Before the Coffee Gets Cold, is a series\nof linked short stories set in an old caf\u00e9 in\na back street of Tokyo. The charming Caf\u00e9\nFuniculi Funicula is home to some eclectic regulars, welcoming staff, and a magical chair by which time travel is possible.\nThough this time travel has absolutely no\nscientific basis, customers are able to visit the past or future provided they adhere\nto a specific set of rules.\nKawaguchi implements the tools of\nmagical realism that are employed in\nother Japanese works such as the Studio\nGhibli films and the novels of Murakami.\nThrough his characters\u2019 poignant en-counters, Kawaguchi explores themes of\nlove, loss, family, and marriage, all with a\nsense of fun and optimism. The scene-by-scene short story style and easy conversations in the novel make it an excellent\nread for when you\u2019re on the go.\nCh\u00e9ri by Colette\nColette is one of the most acclaimed\nFrench writers of the early 20th\ncentury.\nBased in Burgundy and Paris, in France,\nColette churned out novels and short story anthologies, most of which have been\ntranslated into English, among other lan-guages. Among her most recognisable\ntitles \u2013 Gigi, The Vagabond, and her Claudine series \u2013 is a short novel called Ch\u00e9ri.\nCh\u00e9ri tracks the life of its impetuous title\ncharacter through the eyes of his older\nlover Lea.\nLea is a sophisticated 49-year-old socialite clinging to her beauty, while Ch\u00e9ri\n\u2013 given name Fred Peloux \u2013 is a 25-year-old bachelor. The two engage in a quiet\naffair until Ch\u00e9ri is called to wed a girl\nnearer his own age. Colette\u2019s development of Lea examines the need for women \u2013 and older women in particular \u2013 to\nuphold their reputation in society battling against the desire for fulfilling sexual relationships.\nTo delve deeper into the life and mind\nof the French author, who writes from\nher own experiences with affairs and\nscandals, watch Keira Knightley\u2019s portrayal of her in the film Colette.\nMiss Austen by Gill\nHornby\nThe title of Miss Austen refers\nnot to Jane Austen, but to her older sister Cassandra (Cassie), who\nsupported Jane throughout her life\nand career. The novel is a fictional account of the circumstances\nleading Cassie to burn a collection\nof letters written between herself,\nJane, and several of their close\nfriends. Gill Hornby took it upon\nherself to fill in the gaps surrounding Cassie\u2019s motivations through a\nseries of fictional letters and mem-ories, all based on real facts about\nthe family and their relatives.\nHornby emulates the tone and vernacular of Jane Austen\u2019s own nov-els, adding a dash of family drama\nand a drop of witty humour to the mix.\nIf the name Hornby sounds familiar,\nit\u2019s because Gill is sister to author Nick\nHornby. Inspired writing clearly runs in\nthe family, as Miss Austen is delightfully\nentertaining and a touching portrayal of\nthe loving relationship between the Austen sisters.\nThe Summer Book by Tove\nJansson\nRecommended to me by a friend,\nTove Jansson\u2019s The Summer Book was an\nintriguing read. If you\u2019re familiar with\nJansson\u2019s Moomin books and illustra-tions, it will come as no surprise that\nThe Summer Book is filled with similarly\nquirky sketches and uniquely vivid de-scriptions.\nJansson\u2019s premise is the chronicle of\na long childhood summer through a series of loosely connected but independent vignettes. Just as our own summer\nmemories are linked to specific interactions and activities, so is the relationship\nbetween main character Sophia and her\ngrandmother; simultaneously fleeting\nand immortalised.\nThe book explores youth and curiosity\nthrough Sophia\u2019s wide-eyed, emotional\nanalysis of her surroundings, juxtaposed\nagainst Grandmother\u2019s experience and\nknowledge. Scandinavian simplicity\nshines through in this gem of a novel,\nand it\u2019s perfect reading for the transition\nfrom the summer to autumn months.\nA Life on this Planet by David\nAttenborough\nSplit into three parts \u2013 \u2018My Witness\nStatement\u2019, \u2018What Lies Ahead\u2019, and \u2018A\nVision for the Future\u2019 \u2013 David Attenborough\u2019s latest publication is a comprehensive commentary on the interconnected-ness of biodiversity and climate change.\nAttenborough leads the reader through\nhis career in conservation, his lifelong\nrelationship with the natural world, and\nhis time working at the BBC, demonstrating how these passions intertwined.\nWhile becoming one of the most beloved\ntelevision presenters in the world, Attenborough was able to lend time to wildlife\npreservation and climate change caus-es, learning about these issues in great\ndetail. In this semi-memoir, he calls for\npeople to think more urgently about how\nwhat we can collectively do to reduce our\nimpactontheplanetandbringsattention\nto those who are already making great efforts to do so. His informed predictions\nof what our world may become in the\nfollowing decades are enough to give the\nreader nightmares and make them want\nto get up and join a climate protest. A Life\non Our Planet is a poignant recollection of\na life well lived as well as a guiding light\nfor living in a better future.\nSummer snapshots\nBOOKS\nBooksEditor\nZANNA BUCKLAND\nYour Books editor documents a\nseason full of literary travels.\nFelix reading on the beach.

For many stu-dents, this will mean a\nyear of hard work, late nights, and\nexams. We hope, however, that\nyou will find time in your busy\nschedules to pursue your extracurricular interests, and hopeful-ly, pick up a weekly copy of Felix.\nWhat is Felix?\nFelix, for those of you who have stumbled upon our publication for the first\ntime, is Imperial\u2019s very own student\nnewspaper. Published every Friday\nduring term time, Felix contains a\nwide range of content produced by\nentirely by Imperial students. In our\npages, you will find news, investiga-tions, opinion, and reviews on a wide\nvariety of different topics, ranging\nfrom the environment to music, to\nImperial\u2019s very own societies.\nFelix was first published on 9th December 1949. Since then, the paper\nhas gone on to win national awards\nand break stories that have ended up\nin the national news. Our contributors\n\u2013 all former Imperial students \u2013 have\nachieved acclaim working for publications such as the BBC, WIRED,\nthe Financial Times (see page 7), The\nGuardian and The Economist.\nIf print isn\u2019t your preferred format,\nfollow us on Instagram (@felix_im-perial) or sign up for our new weekly\nnewsletter, The Lowdown (see front\npage QR code), where we\u2019ll give you\nbite-sized updates on the most important developments on campus,\nand send you an early digital copy of\nthe newspaper. We aim to shed light\non stories the College won\u2019t tell you\nabout, and to report on your\nexperiences as students (and staff!)\nLast year, we published stories on\nstudent dissatisfaction at the Physics department, and allegations of a\ntoxic culture within Imperial\u2019s security\nteam. This year, we intend to continue\nin the same vein.\nOur motto, \u2018Keep the cat free\u2019, refers not only to our status as a free-to-read publication, but also to our\neditorial independence.

This is indicative of the dramatic changes that have taken place\nat the paper, after the editorial problems that plagued Felix during the\nfirst half of the 2022/23 academic\nyear. Following a period of fortnightly publishing from February to June\n2023, we are back to putting out issues weekly. The interim arrangement where three volunteers shared\nthe role of Editor-in-Chief, has now\ncome to an end. Felix returns with a\nfull-time Editor \u2013 though, for the first\ntime in 51 years, that Editor has been\nappointed, not elected (see page 6).\nWe hope this first issue is a signal of\nour intent.\nAcknowledgments\nLastly, I would like to thank our team\nof contributors for their hard work and\nrelentless dedication to putting this\npaper out. Everything you see within this paper has been put together\nremotely, and on a compressed timeline \u2013 the result of frustrating delays\nwithin the Union and College in appointing the Felix Editor.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n26 | Film 29 september 2023\nof that, and highlights some of the worst\naspects of Allen\u2019s filmmaking. To see Johansson excelling in this stage of her\ncareer, I\u2019d recommend giving The Other\nBoleyn Girl or He\u2019s Just Not That Into You\na go instead.\n2011. We Bought a Zoo\nWe Bought a Zoo is your typical feelgood family movie, and is based on a true\nstory to boot. Based loosely on journalist\nBenjamin Mee\u2019s memoir, the film details\nlife after his wife\u2019s death. Reeling from\nthe trauma and left with two grieving\nkids to look after, Mee (played by\nMatt Damon) looks for a change\nof scenery by buying a new house\noutside the city. The only catch?\nHe has to take ownership and\nmanagement of a zoo along with\nit. Scarlett Johansson plays down-to-earth zookeeper Kelly Foster \u2013\na combination character of three\nzookeepers Mee worked with to\nreopen the facility.\nIn the film, Rosemoor Wildlife\nPark is located in California, but\nits real-life counterpart is Dartmoor Zoological Park in Devon,\nEngland. The Rosemoor version\nof the tale is heart-warming,\nheart-breaking, and at times ter-rifying, but most importantly it\nbrought attention to the incredible story of the real zoo. In biop-ics such as this one, it takes a certain skill to adapt the story into\na screenplay without reducing\nor overdramatising it. Director\nCameron Crowe is exceptional\nin doing this, and the portrayal\nof human and animal interactions is masterful. We Bought a\nZoo is definitely comfort movie material;\nit\u2019s one to come back to again and again.\nJohansson\u2019s boldness and fiery repartee\nwith Damon help make it a particularly\nentertaining watch.\n(Benjamin Mee also studied Science\nCommunication (MSc) at Imperial College, graduating in 1992!)\n2019. Marriage Story\nMarriage Story presents another incredible performance by Johansson, as\nNicole Barber, wife to Adam Driver\u2019s\nCharlie Barber and mother to Azhy Robertson\u2019s Henry. Deeply emotional, Noah\nBaumbach\u2019s drama follows Nicole and\nCharlie as they navigate the decay of their\nmarriage, the fallout of their divorce,\nand eventual reconciliation. It is unusual and refreshing to see a story about a\nbreakup in which neither party is motivated by the desire for an alternative re-lationship. The film traverses every possible feeling that could be experienced\nunder such circumstances: anger, fear,\nregret, nostalgia, admiration, freedom,\nlove. Johansson and Driver have great\nchemistry, but they really shine in their\nsolo scenes, showing vulnerability in the\nface of separation. The movie presents\nwell the multitude of dilemmas and the\nreassessing that happens once a couple\nhas decided to get divorced, as well as the\nimpact it has on any children of the marriage and family members involved. Despite all their differences and how much\nthey change, no matter what happens\nbetween them, the couple puts their son\nHenry first. Marriage Story earned Laura\nDern a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for\nher role as Nicole\u2019s aggressively supportive lawyer, and it is somewhat surprising\nthat Johansson wasn\u2019t granted the same\naccolades. Her ability to create such a\nconvincing, authentic character and display the necessary range of emotions so\nunreservedly is what makes the actress\nirreplaceable.\n2023. Asteroid City\nI was fortunate enough to secure tickets to Glastonbury this year, and even\nmore fortunately managed to squeeze\nin a free viewing of Asteroid City on the\nSunday morning. Hot and exhausted, a\ncouple of friends and I filed into Pilton\nPalais \u2013 the festival\u2019s in-house cinema\n\u2013 to watch Wes Anderson\u2019s newest mas-terpiece. We were treated to an opening\nshort film featuring and introduced by\nBen Wishaw, as well as a personal introduction to Asteroid City from none other\nthan Tilda Swinton, who is an avid supporter of Pilton Palais.\nAnderson is known for his unique,\niconic cinematic style, so much so that\nit has sparked imitative trends in the\nworlds of photography and videography.\nHis ability to maintain a clean, minimalist look without compromising on depth\nand intricacy is astounding, and one\nthat he has spent years perfecting. Asteroid City is no different, and takes this\nto a whole new level by incorporating\nthe mixed media of live action footage\nand animation, both in technicolour and\nblack and white.\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine that \u2018Asteroid City\u2019\nis simply a quirky American town name \u2013\nand it is, to some extent \u2013 but the film also\nhas actual extraterrestrial ties. Running\nalongside this surprising venture\ninto the world of astronomy is the\nstory of a father trying to break\nthe news of his wife\u2019s death to her\nchildren while on a road trip to a\ngifted and talented science pro-gram. I\u2019ll say little more about the\nplot for those who have yet to see\nit, but it is an unexpectedly wild\nride of a movie.\nEven the cast is iconic, filled\nwith many of the familiar faces\nthat have frequented Anderson\u2019s\nprevious projects. There is a specific kind of acting that threads\nthrough all of his movies, and\nit\u2019s a style that Scarlett Johansson and the rest of the A-list\ncast - Jason Schwartzman, Tom\nHanks, Maya Hawke, and Tilda\nSwinton to name a few \u2013 execute\nmagnificently. The actors move\nand speak as deliberately as the\ncamera moves between set piec-es, allowing focus to fall on the\nvisual contents and dialogue of\nthe scene. This could be misconstrued as stiff and rigid if it lacked\nemotion, but, on the contrary, it\ngives the heavier parts of Asteroid City\u2019s\nscript time and space to sink in; freezing\nactions and facial expressions for a few\nprecious moments.\nI\u2019ll never tire of watching Wes Anderson\u2019s work, just as I\u2019ll never tire of watching the evolution of Scarlett Johansson as\nshe continues to take on brilliant directors and complex personas.\nNorth Star \u2013 the directorial debut of\nKristin Scott Thomas \u2013 premiered at the\nToronto Film Festival on 7th\nSeptember,\nand is Johansson\u2019s latest acting credit.\nScarlett Johannson in the discussed titles.

What types\nof magnetometer are used in your\nmissions?\nFrom my perspective, I\u2019m interested in\nthe planetary science, and one of the\nmost important realisations that we\u2019ve\ncome to in the last 20 years is that you\ncan use magnetometer instruments not\nonly to measure the environment inside a\nplanet, but you can use them to see inside\nthe planet as well, and the planet\u2019s moons\ntoo. And so, magnetometers are always\ndescribed as in-situ instruments, they\ntake the measurement where you\u2019re at\n- but in some sense they\u2019re remote sensing instruments too - measurements you\ntake on the outside allow you to work out\nwhat\u2019s going on inside. As far as evolving is concerned: there are two types of\ninstruments that can and are being built.\nThere are the Rolls-Royce type instru-ments, that go on planetary missions like\nJUICE, and there you need to be flying an\ninstrumentthathasalotofflightheritage\n- you don\u2019t want to be flying something\nthat might not work - ESA and NASA\nknow that. For a JUICE-type mission, you\nneed to show the instrument is at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 9, which is\nready to go into outer space. In fact, one\nof the sensors we built for JUICE was at\nTRL 5 that was first chosen, that was a\nscalar sensor. We had, during the build\nphase, it was flown on a Chinese mission\nthat showed it was able to fly. For smaller\nmissions, CubeSat for example, you can\nfly these small magnetoresistive sensors,\nthose are very light, and you can afford to\nfly them where the TRL isn\u2019t so high. It\u2019s a\ntest case; if it works, it demonstrates you\ncan fly the instrument on a subsequent\nmission. It\u2019s a prong approach - build the\nbest instruments you can but also make\nsure the ones that\u2019ll give you the best science output are the ones that are known\nbest, and you know they will work.\nBut we still fly more than one - on\nJUICE, we\u2019ve got three! We usually fly\ntwo, if you want to measure the magnetic\nfield around a planet you want to make\nsure you\u2019re measuring the magnetic field\nof the planet and not the spacecraft: and\nso we put the magnetometers on a very\nlong boom; one on the very end and one\nhalfway down. That allows you, through\nthe gradiometer technique, to measure\nwhat we can see halfway down compared\nto the end, and that works out if there\u2019s\nany spacecraft field. But it\u2019s also redun-dant; on Cassini, the one at the end of\nthe boom built by the Jet Propulsion\nLab, stopped working once one year after we got there; so we only used the one\nthat was halfway down the boom. Space\nis quite scary! You\u2019re never quite sure\nwhat\u2019s going to happen!\nYou should assume you\u2019re going to\ncome across difficulties at some stage.\nOn Cassini, when the onboard sensor\nstopped working, we had to think about\nhow you\u2019re going to recalibrate the in-strument. One of the things we needed to\nis know where the zero level of the instrument is: if you\u2019re measuring really small\nchanges in a magnetic field and you\u2019re\nsaying, \u201cOh, we\u2019re seeing an ocean,\u201d if\nyou don\u2019t know where the zero level is\nthat doesn\u2019t help very much. What we\nused to do on Cassini is that we used the\ntwo different instruments to calibrate\neach other. Once we only had one left\nthough - we had to roll the entire spacecraft to calibrate the remaining mag-netometer: around two separate axes, in\na quiet field. When I went to the Cassini\nproject and told them we had to do that,\nthey said: \u201cReally?!\u201d. You need to be ready\nto think of a solution.\nIgniting the Passion for\nPlanetary Science and\nBreaking Barriers in STEM\nM: You mentioned your interest in\nplanetary science, what makes it interesting for you - especially as lots of\nphysicists like space!\nIt was a rather circuitous route to get\nthere. I was at an all-girls school in South\nAfrica and I didn\u2019t do science at school.\nThey didn\u2019t have science, and I was quite\ngood at maths \u2013 my dad worked at the\nlocal university, and they were willing\nto take a chance on me and offered me\nthe opportunity to do a BSc. And the\nfirst couple of years were really difficult:\ndidn\u2019t understand physics, didn\u2019t understand chemistry. But I persevered, and in\nthe end I got a PhD in Applied Maths. I\u2019d\nnever looked at a piece of data in my entire life! I then went to Germany for two\nyears, I was on a fellowship and again I\nwas working in Applied Maths. And then\nI came here, where I was working with\nthe Principal Investigator of the mag-netometer instrument on Cassini; but\nthen I was focusing on a theory-based\nproject. After about six months he said\nto me: \u201cOh, we\u2019ve got a spacecraft going\nto fly past Jupiter, called Ulysses, which\nused Jupiter as a planetary assist to get it\ninto orbit around the Sun. We want to put\na magnetic field model together for Jupiter, are you interested?\u201d. That sounded\nreally interesting so I said yes - and that\u2019s\nhow I got into planetary physics. So basically I said yes to something that sounded\nvery interesting but really I wasn\u2019t sure if\nI could do it!\nBut, in fact, my first view of Jupiter and\nSaturn was because of my dad who built\na telescope when I was a kid, and we saw\nJupiter and Saturn through the telescope,\nso there\u2019s a tenuous link there.\nM: As a woman in STEM, have you\nfaced many challenges progressing\nthrough your career, or has it been relatively straight forward?\nI don\u2019t feel that I\u2019ve had any challenges.\nBut I make it clear to people if I don\u2019t appreciate the way they behave.\nIt was people before me who helped\nme break through the glass ceiling. There\nwas a colleague of mine who worked at\nUCLA, she\u2019s an emeritus professor, Margaret Kivelson, she\u2019s 94, and she\u2019s doing\nsomething similar on the Europa-Clipper\nmission to what I\u2019m doing on JUICE. She\nwas the one who helped pave the way - I\nsort of followed her.\nM: So it\u2019s almost like standing on the\nshoulders of giants.\nYes, although Margie\u2019s 5\u2019 3\u201d! But, my ideal would be when that isn\u2019t a question\nthat\u2019s asked. And we\u2019ve got a way to go\nbefore we get there, I think. You know,\nI think one of the issues with kids at\nschool is they don\u2019t see many female sci-entists. And so they don\u2019t think, \u201cOh yes,\nof course I could go and do physics or do\nchemistry\u201d. We\u2019ve got an outreach program in the department where we have\npostdocs, some of our students going out\ninto schools, talking about anyone being\nable to do science. And so we still need to\nwork on it. But my ideal would be when\nyou don\u2019t have to ask me that question.\nIt might be beyond the end of my career,\nbut let\u2019s hope we get there.\nA New Chapter: From Head of\nDepartment to IOP Presidency\nM: Congratulations on becoming the\nPresident-Elect of the IOP! How do\nyou feel about that? It\u2019s a very big responsibility and also there\u2019s a rich history of physicists who have held the\nsame position like Lord Kelvin, Ernst\nRutherford and Jocelyn Bell Burnell.\nIt\u2019s quite cool, isn\u2019t it?\nIt is very cool. So let me put it into con-text. I have another year and a bit left in\nthis role. And so I\u2019m planning my future.\nI will stay at Imperial, but once I stopped\nbeing Head of Department, I realised I\nJ-MAG, Imperial\u2019s magnetometer currently onboard JUICE.

I want a bit of a range.\u201d I said.\n\u201cMaybe football for sports, one for arts, and one for edu-cation. Maybe singing and medical devices?\u201d I respond-ed. I had already read the website and seen the mass\nof societies available, but I was thinking about which\nwould be most useful. Should I take advantage of the\nsocieties on offer and join as many as I can? Should I try\na new sport, activity, or skill? Should I join the Korean\nsociety to try and learn the language better? Many questions such as these were in my head. I had a few people\naround me to ask questions, so I took advantage of that.\n\u201cDon\u2019t join too many societies.\u201d said Amy \u201cyou won\u2019t\nhave time to make a proper impact in so many societies.\nJust focus on one or maybe two. Also, you have your\nclasses to focus on.\u201d I took her advice and only joined\none society in my first year. I quit early on due to the\ntime commitment, and thought I had to wait until my\nsecond year to try again. Year two rolled around and I\nso I tried again, but again found I couldn\u2019t commit. In\nearly February of my second year, I applied to Felix and I\nnow finally feel I have found my place within Imperial\u00b4s\nsocieties scene.\n\u201cGo to the Give-it-a-Go sessions, stick to only one or\ntwo societies\u201d, said another friend. \u201cJoin one cultural\n(your country) and one personal interest (e.g., an art or\nclimate change club)\u201d. This friend is currently the chair\nof her cultural society and co-chair of the CEC.\nAt Felix, we sent a short survey out to our Instagram\nfollowers to see what advice they would give to you,\nthe newest batch of students at Imperial. From 20 re-sponses, 85% joined a society in year one. An average\nof 2-6 societies were joined by each person, yet the majority only joined one (an outlier with 9 societies raised\nthe average). 50% had joined a cultural society, and, of\nthe ones that did, gave an average rating of 3.6 out of\n5. When asked to rank their societies time commitment\nfrom 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest), the average response was\n6.5/10. The mode was 10/10.\nStudents were also asked to comment on their socie-ties. Out of 19 responses, the majority of comments said\nthat they \u2018enjoyed it a lot\u2019, \u2018made lots of great friends\u2019,\nand made some of their \u2018fondest memories\u2019. Some\nmembers quit due to \u2018inactivity\u2019, \u2018superficial and cold\ncorporate meetings\u2019, lack of \u2018interesting events\u2019, and one\nresponder mentioned they \u2018didnt have enough in common with people\u2019. That is completely understandable. I\nhave quit two societies purely due to personal reasons.\nSometimes quitting helps you move forward to other\nthings. The final question asked for people\u2019s advice on\njoining societies. \u2018Go for whatever makes you interested in things\u2019. Societies are a great way to \u2018make friends\u2019,\n\u2018stay fit\u2019, \u2018relieve stress over exam time\u2019, \u2018try to a sport\u2019,\n\u2018meet invaluable people\u2019, \u2018build your career\u2019, \u2018broaden\nyour horizons outside of school\u2019 and \u2018be adventurous\u2019.\nI remember that, at the Freshers\u2019 fair, it was overwhelming having people talking to you and trying to\npersuade you to join them. \u2018Look at the website before\ngoing to Freshers\u2019 fair and make a list; it can get a bit\noverwhelming going in blind\u2019, one survey responder\nsaid. Freshers\u2019 week is already packed with socials and\nintroductory events, and the fair is the cherry on top of\nall these fast-paced events. However, one answer of the\nsurvey made a good argument to \u2018use the low-commit-ment period of Freshers\u2019 week to really dig in and attend\nas many events as you can\u2019.\nSign-ups are often in the same week and tryouts\nmight be the next day. Only 24 hours to make a decision!\nBack in first year, I knew I had to make my decision\nquickly, so I chose what I knew: football. A great start,\nand I thought that would be it, until I became Societies\neditor for Felix.\nImperial Athletes\nIn order to join any official sports clubs, you must\njoin Imperial Athletes; the annual fee is \u00a310. Many\nsports teams play in national organisations and leagues\nagainst other universites, hence competition is a natural\npart of these societies. Most sports have tryouts early on\nin order to determine the official teams which will play\nin national leagues. Other societies are more welcoming\nfor people who want to join in the middle of the year. I\ncan\u2019t speak for all societies, but if you are interested in\njoining mid-term, just send an email or a message on\nInstagram or other social media, and see what their policy is. I felt more than welcome to try each society that\nI interviewed for articles last year. You might also see\nmultiple societies for the same sport. ICSM stands for\nImperial College School of Medicine; the medics team,\nwhile RSM stands for the Royal School of Mines, which\nhouses departments such as Materials, Bioengineering,\nand Earth Sciences.\nCultural Societies\nLast year, I watched Singaporean society perform a\nbeautiful and hilarious three-hour long self-written musical and wrote an article to comment on their success.\nI was amazed. Pure enjoyment filled my tears as I cried\nof laughter. Furthermore, seeing how the Turkish society raised funds after the earthquake or how my friends\nannounced the Moroccan society\u2019s plans to respond to\nthe earthquake in Marrakech, I began to see that cutural\nsocieties are more than just homes away from home for\ninternational students; they are also opportunities for\nothers to learn and support without leaving the UK.\nFelix and Societies\nI interviewed a number of societies in the last few\nmonths, and I plan to interview more and more in the\nupcoming terms, so please email felix@ic.ac.uk if your\nsociety would like to publish a feature, or if you would\nlike to give me the honour of interviewing your society\nto writing about it myself. The Societies section aims to\ntell the success stories of our students outside of aca-demics. We at Felix love to learn more about the incredible ideas that our peers come up with.\nFind more information about each society and see all\nsports clubs by scanning the QR code below.\nUntil next time,\nCharlotte\nImperial\u2019s\nsocieties\nSOCIETIES\nSocietiesEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nWelcome to Felix\u00b4s\nSocieties section,\nwhere we aim to paint\na picture of the vast\nscene of student-led\nclubs at Imperial.\nDon\u2019t join too many\nsocieties. You won\u2019t\nhave time to make a\nproper impact in so\nmany societies.\n\u201c\n3\nOCT\nWelcome Fair,\nSouth Kensington campus\n\n"

On 12th\nand\n15th\nMay 1972, Imperial students took to the ballot to appoint Oliver Dowson, a first-year Maths student, to the\nrole of Felix Editor. Prior to this, the Editor was selected\nby the volunteer staff that worked on the paper.\nThat first election was notable in more ways than one\nfor the newspaper. In addition to being the first Editor\nelected by the student body, Dowson would become\nthe first to serve in the role as a sabbatical officer of the\nUnion. This would make Felix the only British student\nnewspaper with a full-time editor-in-chief.\nFurthermore, Dowson would become the first Felix\nEditor to produce a weekly publication.\n\u201cIt was very much a hobby-type newspaper before\nthat,\u201d said Dowson, when I spoke to him last Thursday.\n\u201cIt was not much more than a dozen or so of us, who\nmet up on an evening or two a week to put together\nsome content.\u201d\nThe paper was published fortnightly before Dowson\u2019s election, and the Editor, who was then a full-time\nstudent, had to juggle their Felix duties with university\nstudies. Their only privileges in the role were a guaranteed room in a College hall of residence (rent not paid\nfor), and the right to drink from the Editor\u2019s tankard in\nthe Union Bar.\nMany previous Editors struggled to manage the\nworkload; then, as today, in a university of STEM stu-dents, the paper struggled to find contributors. Indeed,\nDowson\u2019s immediate predecessor bemoaned \u2018the prevalent apathy at IC\u2019, saying it made editing Felix \u2018infinitely\nmore difficult\u2019\n.\nIn 1969,\nan Editor resigned citing\n\u2018the lack of\nstaff working\nfor Felix at the\npresent time\u2019\n.\n\u2018Left [with]\na straight choice between carrying on in my present\ncapacity and ultimately destroying any chance of getting a good degree at the end of the year, or resigning\nthe editorship, I have decided on the latter course,\u2019 he\nwrote.\nAs early as 1959, one prescient Editor proposed a\nsolution: \u2018If the Union could be persuaded to pay out\nsome more money and employ at least two permanent\nstaff for their newspaper, then perhaps the weekly Felix\nwill become a possibility!\u2019\nAnd so, 13 years later, such an arrangement was\nreached, albeit with only a single sabbatical officer at\nthe helm. Dowson recalls that the very first Felix Editor election was something of a shoo-in. \u201cI didn\u2019t have\nmuch opposition, as I remember. None of the other volunteers wanted to go on and become the full-time Editor.\u201d His only opposition was \u201cone guy who was heavily\ninto the Socialist Worker fraternity, and spent most of\nhis platform talking not about the newspaper, but the\nneed to spend time waving the flag for workers.\u201d\nImperial has changed significantly since that time,\nbut Felix continues to publish, and the Editor-in-Chief\nremains a sabbatical officer. Talking to past Editors, I\nwas surprised to hear that our current difficulties recruiting students were a source of frustration even then\n\u2013 as one put it, \u201cStudents enjoyed reading\nFelix, but few showed\nmuch interest in how\nit was produced\u201d\n.\nThis year, we would\nlike to bring you content that informs, en-gages, and entertains,\nand to give the paper and its content a bigger presence\nat the College. But to do that, we need to add to our\ndedicated team of contributors.\nTherefore, I would like to reiterate the message in\nour editorial this week: if our content interests you, and\nyou are at all considering getting involved, please get\nin touch! Some open roles are advertised on page 3,\nbut we are always looking for more contributors. If you\nhave a different skill set that you think could still benefit\nthe paper, please email me at felix@imperial.ac.uk. And\nyou are always welcome to submit content to our sections by emailing the relevant section editor (see page\n2, \u2018Contact Us\u2019, for details).\nFelix Editor to be appointed\nfrom now on, not elected\nT\nhis year, for the first time in Felix history, the paper\u2019s\nEditor-in-Chief was appointed by a selection panel,\nafter Union Council approved a motion by former\nFelix Editor and Student Trustee Sam Lovatt to change\nthe selection process.\nSince 1972, the Felix Editor has been elected each year\nin a Union-wide ballot, usually together with the other\nsabbatical officers of the Union during the annual Leadership Elections.\n\u2018This process is no longer fit for purpose\u2019, reads the\nmotion to change the process. \u2018Three of the last four\nFelix Editors have operated at a standard below that expected of them, leading two of them to resign before the\nend of their year in office.\u2019\nIn the new appointment process, applicants for\nthe role will be required to submit a CV, alongside answers to three questions. The questions will assess their\nknowledge of higher education, Imperial College, and\nthe student union.\nTheir applications will be reviewed by a selection\npanel for shortlisting. Under normal circumstances, the\npanel will have a student majority, and will consist of\nthe Union\u2019s Director of Membership Services, a Student\nTrustee of the Union, the Union Council Chair, the outgoing Felix Editor, and a representative from the College\nCommunications Division.\nShortlisted candidates will be invited to submit a\nshort article in response to a prompt devised by the\nentire panel. The submissions will be assessed only by\nthose panel members representing Felix and the College\nCommunications Division.\nAfter this, all shortlisted candidates will be invited\nto an interview, which assesses their ability to manage\nstakeholders, lead the Felix team, and report on current affairs relevant to Imperial students. In addition to\nanswering a series of questions from the interviewers,\ncandidates will be required to edit a short written piece\nfilled with errors. Only the Director of Membership Services, a Student Trustee, and the Council Chair will conduct the interview under normal circumstances.\nThe entire panel will then convene to decide upon the\nbest candidate. If there are no appointable candidates,\nthe appointment process will be re-opened.\nChange is biggest\nshake-up to paper\u2019s\nstructure in 50 years.\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nBlast from the past...\nI dug deep into the archives\nto learn how the Felix Editor\nbecame a sabbatical officer.\n\n"

It was founded only a few months ago by\nXiang Hong Tan, a third-year Chemical Engineering student\nat Imperial. I sat down with Xiang Hong to find out more\nabout the initiative.\nWhat is Towards Net Zero (TNZ) and what are your\naims?\nTNZ is a global initiative that is student-led, and currently all\nthe members are students from Imperial. They are mostly\nfrom engineering backgrounds. The mission is to educate\nand empower individuals with knowledge and skills to make\nan impact in sustainability. There are a few aims, segmented into different target groups. The first one is students,\nbecause we have the education and power to make significant changes in the future when we are working, especially\nin green careers. Then there\u2019s the younger age, kids or high\nschoolers. We might organise some workshops [or] make\nsome simple, interactive, appealing content [for them].\nI love how your content targets the people that haven\u2019t\ngone into university yet, because when they\u2019re making\ntheir course and career choices, they can have that in the\nback of their head. What format will this content take?\nIt\u2019s a global initiative, so we want everyone around the\nworld to access information. The only way we can do that is\nthrough social media, because everyone has social media ac-counts. Our priority is to upload to Instagram so that everyone around the world can come across [our content] and be\neducated. Everyone uses Instagram, whether you\u2019re young\nor old. We also have content on LinkedIn to target the pro-fessionals, because LinkedIn is used to seek career opportu-nities, and there are a lot of green careers. We might make\n[professionals] knowledgeable and expose the LinkedIn\ncommunities to these green career opportunities.\nYou\u2019ve got a lot of online presence \u2013 but since so much of\nyour committee is Imperial based, are you planning any\nin person events?\nWe are going to organise some events with Chemical Engineering Society, because most of us [study] chemical engineering and one of [our] directors is part of their committee.\nWe will collaborate \u2013 we provide ideas for content and they\nprovide us with the location, the venue, and refreshments.\nThose [events] are only for Imperial students. But we also\nhave plans to extend it by including international students.\nCurrently we have a team based in France and they are mostly working on the politics and economy aspects of the TNZ\ninitiative. I told them about the idea of organising activities\nat their university.\nAre there any plans to expand outside engineering, to\nmaybe get people on board from the sciences or even\nmedicine?\nYes, currently we have medicine students as our ambassa-dors. Because, as I said, we want to be inclusive. There are\nsome medicine students who are working on the simpler\ncontent \u2014 with titles like Climate Change 101 \u2014 so it\u2019s a\nsimple step for them to contribute to this initiative.

Whether you\u2019re a fresh face to the\nBig Smoke or a regular City dweller, you\nnow have the perfect opportunity to reap\nthe benefits that London bestows upon\nthe artist, the art-lover, and the art-curi-ous. London has some of the oldest and\nlargest collections and galleries in the\nworld, but with so many institutions to\nchoose from, knowing which to tackle\nfirst or which will appeal to you the most\ncan seem difficult. Thus, Felix has compiled a list of essential galleries for you to\nexperience and familiarise yourself with\nfor a true London art experience.\nThe National Gallery\nThe most obvious choice of a gallery in\nLondon is the National Gallery (often referred to as NatGal). Located in Trafalgar\nSquare, the National Gallery is one of the\nUK\u2019s largest collections of international\nart. In this gallery, you can expect to find\nart spanning the Renaissance all the way\nup to the 20th\ncentury, including paintings by big names like Da Vinci, Titian,\nTurner, and Bacon. NatGal is the perfect\nplace to experience all kinds of art from\ndifferent periods, and get a flavour for\na variety of artists and art movements\nfrom around the world.\nThe Portrait Gallery\nAround the corner from NatGal is the\nNational Portrait Gallery, a vast collection of portrait paintings from over the\nages. This type of gallery appeals not just\nto the art-lover, but also to the avid histo-rian, as portraits give us insight into historical periods and into the personal lives\nof famous figures throughout these ages.\nTate Britain\nLocated in Pimlico, the Tate was\nfounded by the co-owner of the \u2018Tate &\nLyle\u2019 sugar company to house a large collection of acquired art.

Flash forward 15\nyears, and you must choose between the bizarre Hocus Pocus, with a plot that made me yearn to have been\nin the writers\u2019 room, and Free Willy, which could have\nput you off enjoying an aquarium ever again. Another\n15 years later, and the choice is between Mamma Mia,\nwhich made every viewer dream of moving to a Greek\nisland, and The Dark Knight, featuring one of the most\niconic Jokers to date.\nAdding to this saga of polar-opposite blockbusters\nwith the same summertime premiere date, 2023 saw the\nrelease of Barbie and Oppenheimer. While some claim\nthis was an intentional move by Warner Bros, the company behind Barbie, due to their vendetta against Christopher Nolan, director of Oppenheimer, it cannot be denied that both films benefitted from the rivalry. Many\npeople who would have otherwise only watched one of\nthe films saw both on the same day just to \u2018do Barbenheimer right\u2019, the notion of simply watching both films\nwithin the week of release deemed as being not enough.\nPlanned outfits, primarily for Barbie watchers, became\na must, and group plans for coffee before Oppenheimer\nand cocktails before Barbie were commonplace.\nIn my opinion, as someone who admittedly lacks the\ninclination to go to cinemas nearly as often as a cine-phile, competition like this is one of the best things that\ncan happen for both the creators of films and the theatres in which they\u2019re played. For the first time since at\nleast the pandemic, I had genuine difficulty finding a\nseat both on and after the release date. The films\u2019 combined box office grossing was over $2 billion USD, and\nthe seats for both films being sold out worldwide for\nweeks speaks to the sheer success both have achieved.\nSomething that Barbie has also achieved in spades\nover a short period is causing breakups, particularly affecting heterosexual couples. The film is Greta Gerwig\u2019s\nbiggest project to date, with a greater budget, marketing,\nand controversy than any of her previous films. Gerwig,\nwho also directed Little Women and Ladybird, is known\nfor the feminist subject matter of her films, which are\ncelebrated for their exploration of girlhood and the loss\nof innocence associated with maturing. Barbie is no out-lier, exploring the effects of the patriarchy on both men\nand women after the residents of the feminist utopia\nBarbieland encounters the ideals of the real world. The\nfilm also features the employees of Mattel themselves,\nas well as a mother-daughter duo whose actions lead\nBarbie to begin experiencing human emotions such as\nsadness and anxiety.\nNow, what about this could lead to breakups? They\nappear to be caused by men\u2019s reactions upon seeing the\nmovie, and the ensuing conversation once the unhappy\ncouple leaves the theatre. A common complaint against\nBarbie is that it has exaggerated the problems faced\nby women, and presents men as incompetent villains.\nUpon realizing how much the other gender stressed that\n\u2018not all men\u2019 are aggressors, and that men have issues\ntoo, women often found themselves embroiled in the\nfruitless argument regarding which gender has it worse.\nA lack of consensus can eventually lead to more problems or the realization that maybe the partners don\u2019t\nhave the same viewpoints in life. For some, it\u2019s not even\nan argument that ends the relationship \u2013 some women\nwho have been long unsatisfied with their relationships\nhave reported that the movie made them come to terms\nwith their previously repressed emotions, leading to\nthem ending the relationship for their own sake.\nOf course, one could argue that Barbie isn\u2019t the cause\nof the relationships ending. They would be right \u2013 Barbie\nis a common denominator, but not the cause. So what\nhas it done to deserve this backlash? Firstly, Barbie is a\ncomedy movie, making it easier to dismiss \u2013 the movie\nleans towards satire and humour to communicate with\nits audience, barring some select scenes, hence some of\nits messages can be missed by viewers, especially if they\ndon\u2019thavepreviousexperiencewiththetopicsdiscussed\nat hand. Secondly, the movie starts with an introduction\nto Barbieland \u2013 a feminist utopia where the Kens are\nconsidered second-class citizens, with no purpose in life\nother than making the Barbies happy. This predictably\nleads to outrage among certain viewers, when they have\nnot yet made it to the end of the movie, which concludes\nthat both the Kens and the Barbies were wrong. The film\nends with both Barbie and Ken setting off to find their\ncalling, no longer conforming to the toxic gender norms\nthat had previously made them miserable. Frankly, it\u2019s\nas good a message regarding gender equality as it gets,\nand, like any good piece of art, it provokes emotions in\nits audience.\nIn defence of\nBarbie\nCOMMENT\nCommentWriter\nBARBARA ROSE\nGreta Gerwig did what\nshe does best \u2013 making\nwomen mourn for their\ngirlhood and making\nmen uncomfortable.\nGreta Gerwig discusses Barbie at an event.

Clarke\u2019s less-er-known novels, Prelude to Space, documents the documentation of the first\nmoon landing. It was first published in\n1951, 18 years before the actual moon\nlanding took place, and was one of\nmany literary preconceptions of the\nevent.PreludetoSpace\u2019splaceinthescience fiction genre could be debated, as\nmuch of its plot takes place before anyone actually steps foot on the moon.\nInstead it follows American historian\nDirk Alexson as he learns the technicalities and politics that go on behind\nthe scenes, in boardrooms and labo-ratories. The perspective is an interesting one, that has been of increased\npublic interest in the years since the\nreal mission of Apollo 11. Prelude is\nproving an entertaining read, and even\nmore so given Clarke\u2019s choice to house\nthe space agency in London, including\nlocations not far from our own university\u2019s campus.\nK\nilling Thatcher, written by The Guardian\u2019s Ireland\ncorrespondent Rory Carroll, retraces the events\nsurrounding the infamous Brighton bombing in\n1984 and the IRA\u2019s attempt to kill the sitting Prime Minister, Margret Thatcher. Released in the wake of the 25th\nanniversary of the Good Friday agreement, the non-fic-tion book is the first to focus solely on the event.\nThe man tasked with assassinating Maggie Thatcher, ironically named Patrick Magee, was someone who\ncan\u2019t catch a break. He had a troubled relationship with\nhis wife, got arrested countless times, and, this goes\nwithout saying, didn\u2019t manage to kill Thatcher.\nCarroll\u2019s detailed account of Magee\u2019s whereabouts in\nEngland are interspersed with his own reflections later\non in life, which are characteristically dry \u2013 for example,\n\u2018my life was too chaotic\u2019 used to describe \u2018...a series of\nsetbacks\u2019. Magee deliberately presented himself to the\nworld as so dull that no one seems to even remember\nwhat he looks like (a useful trait for someone who has attempted to assassinate a sitting prime minister); Carroll\ndoes well to chip away at this fa\u00e7ade and reveal a more\ndetailed portrait of the man. The bleak reality of being\nan anonymous IRA operative in England is contrasted\nwith the historical implications of the task at hand. Just\nas how Guy Fawkes planted a bomb under the Houses of\nParliament that didn\u2019t even go off, and now effigies of\nhim are burned every year. The events of the book must\nseem surreal to those born after The Troubles; \u2018one of\nthe great what ifs\u2019 that even Thatcher herself chose not\nto comprehend.\nCarroll dwells on some of the major turning points\nthroughout The Troubles, such as the death of Bobby\nSands and the rise of Gerry Adams\u2019 Armalite and Ballot\nBox strategy, providing context for readers unfamiliar\nwith the period. However, by focusing on the \u2018England\nDepartment\u2019 \u2013 and specifically a single operation of\ntheirs \u2013 these public-facing protagonists are sidelined in\nfavour of a different kind of history. One populated with\nregular people: students, office workers, and landlords.\nThe accounts in the book provide important insight\ninto the human cost of the troubles on both sides. Relief\ncomes, somewhat unsurprisingly, not from the members of the IRA (and Gerry Adams), but from the British detectives tasked with locating Magee. The tangle\nof regional agencies searching for Magee as he evades\ncapture across the UK, with the regional jurisdiction\nchanging every other page, results in a thrilling chase of\ncomically bureaucratic proportions.\nMaybe it\u2019s still too soon for a screen adaptation of\nthese events; Carroll has been sensitive with his accounts and sources (with obvious reason), and many\nwounds are still fresh, particularly regarding Thatcher\u2019s\nthen \u2018loyal enforcer\u2019 Norman Tebbit, whose wife was\nparalysed by the assassination attempt. However, the\nbook is a thorough account of a major event in modern\nBritish history that is genuinely hard to put down. Following the successes of The Crown, with its relentless\nmarch from past through to present, and the Happy\nValley genre of regional crime drama, Killing Thatcher\nhas all the hallmarks of a hit series. Regardless of how\npeople judge the event, Carroll has provided a valuable\naccount, and one to remember.\nBook review:\nKilling Thatcher\nBooksWriter\nTOM SAVAGE\nA commentary\non Rory Carroll\u2019s\ninvestigation into the\nnear-assassination of\nMargaret Thatcher.\nThe Oxford University Press Very\nShortIntroduction books are, as the title\nsuggests, brief but complete overviews\nof various topics, explained by an expert on the subject. Climate Change\n(originally Global Warming) is one of\nthe earlier titles in the series, which\nstarted in 1995, and as such doesn\u2019t\nhave the most up-to-date graphs. However, it still covers a relevant history of\nclimate research and the impacts of\nclimate change and global warming on\nsociety,bothtangibleandhypothetical.\nWhile Maslin\u2019s exploration of statistics\nand figures is excellent, the frequent\neditorial errors throughout this particular title make it a slow read. Regardless, the Short Introduction books\nare compact and efficient, and are still\nuseful to get a feel for the subject ter-minology, as well as basic concepts and\nbackground.\nCurrently reading...\nClimate Change: A Very Short\nIntroduction by Mark Maslin\nPrelude to Space by\nArthur C.

He\nwill see out the remainder of his term, which ends in\nDecember.\nAllan returned to his post on 14th\nJuly, and heads of\ndepartment were informed four days later, in an email\nfrom College President Hugh Brady. The College said it\nwould inform students when they returned to university after the summer break.\nNone of the four anonymous allegations against Mr\nAllan have been substantiated, and he has vehemently\ndenied all but one of them \u2013 that he told a woman her\ndress \u201csuited her figure\u201d. Mr Allan said he made the\ncomment after seeing she was \u201clooking a bit down in the\nmouth\u201d, in an attempt to \u201ccheer her up\u201d. A spokesperson\nfor Allan said he was \u201cmortified\u201d after making the com-ment, and apologised immediately.\nAllan chose to step back at a meeting of College Council on Friday 12th\nMay, saying he was doing so in the interests of the Imperial community. His resumption of\nduties marks a change from his original position; in\nMay, Mr Allan said he would be stepping back until the\nsituation was resolved.\nIn the aftermath of the allegations, Allan embarked\non a campaign to assert his innocence. In a series of\nmedia interviews during May and June, he rebutted the\nclaims, and positioned himself as a defender of the presumption of innocence.\nAllan described the current discourse around cases like his as \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d. He told\nThe Times he was \u201cdefinitely on the side of the angels\u201d,\nhaving spent \u201cmy working life actually trying to ensure\nthere are opportunities for women\u201d.\nSpeaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News in June, he said\nthere was \u201cabsolutely no substance\u201d in the claims, and\nfelt he had been \u201cpropelled under the nearest bus\u201d. Allan said he had received hundreds of letters of support\nsince the claims emerged, many from women who knew\nhim.\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that [the allegations] surfaced together in one article in The Guardian\u201d, he continued. \u201cThat after 50-plus years of\u2026impeccable conduct towards wom-en, suddenly, this little clutch of allegations appears\u201d.\nAllan said that throughout his career, he had supported women who had faced unwanted advances from\nsuperiors. But, he added, \u201cI am worried at the moment,\nthat we might take a step back, because quite a lot of\nmen say to me they\u2019re getting increasingly nervous\nabout working with women, mentoring women, something I\u2019ve done a lot of right through my career.\u201d\n\u201cI mean isn\u2019t that a bit sexist in itself?\u201d countered\nRidge.\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Allan elaborated:\n\u201cYounger male CEOs are now saying: \u2018Be careful about\ngetting in a lift with so-and-so in case an allegation is\nmade.\u2019 And this is really unhelpful to women.\u201d\n\u201cNow we\u2019re getting to the stage where men\u2019s rights\nalso need to be protected.\u201d\nThe Guardian, which originally reported the allega-tions, said: \u201cWe stand by our journalism and the people\nwho continue to come forward to tell their stories despite the significant risks involved.\u201d\nJohn Allan resumes role as\nCollege Council Chair\nAllan is facing four\nunsubstantiated\nclaims of inappropriate\nbehaviour towards\nwomen. He denies\nthree.\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nJohn Allan speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News in June. Sky News\nHistory Group\u2019s recommendation to rename the Huxley Building was met with strong reactions. Huxley was\na slavery abolitionist, but, noted the Group, \u2018his essay\nEmancipation \u2013 Black and White, espouses a racial hierarchy of intelligence...that fed the dangerous and false\nideology of eugenics\u2019.\nAt a forum to discuss the proposals in early 2022,\nmany staff and alumni expressed distaste towards the\nproposed renaming of the Huxley Building. One faculty\nmember argued that there was very little evidence for\nHuxley\u2019s alleged links to eugenics, while another described Huxley\u2019s essay as \u2018a polemic for the abolition of\nslavery.\u2019\nOne comment submitted prior to the forum accused\nImperial of rewriting the past and making \u2018an ungrate-ful, spiteful generation feel better about themselves.\u2019\nAnother urged the College to \u2018stand strong against\n[such] ridiculous accusations\u2019.\nUltimately, Imperial settled on a compromise: it said\nit would retain Huxley\u2019s name, but \u2018provide a fuller understanding of [his] complex character\u2019. A new joint\nname would be created for the Huxley Building, by adding the name of a \u2018pathbreaking scientist from a Black,\nAsian, or other minority ethnic background\u2019. A similar\napproach would be taken with the Beit Building, pending consultation with students.\nImperial has yet to proceed with either of these ac-tions. Renaming Central Library is its most striking\ndecision to date on this matter.\nIf you would like to comment on the discussion above,\nplease write in to comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\n\n"

Lost in Translation\nOften hailed as a great modern\nclassic, Lost in Translation was one\nof those films that felt slightly in-timidating, and potentially disap-pointing, to watch. It\u2019s a film that\ncalls for the right headspace and an\natmosphere free of interruptions\nand distractions for full appreci-ation, so what better time than a\nlazy summer evening at home?\nLost In Translation is subtle and\neffortless. It has a natural flow to it\nthat feels almost melodic. There is\na gentle rhythm and comedy to Bill\nMurray and Scarlett Johansson\u2019s\nperformances that brings their\ncharacters gracefully to life. This is\nthe work of Sofia Coppola\u2019s insightful writing.\nAs they say, \u2018a picture paints a\nthousand words\u2019, and each frame\nof Lost in Translation paints double\nthat. The brilliance of Coppola\u2019s\ndirection comes from her ability\nto evoke depth and emotion with\nminimal dialogue. She creates artistic scenes around her characters\u2019 solitary experiences, during\nwhich we are asked to question\nand envision their thoughts. It\u2019s a\nstyle of filmmaking that begs to be\nwatched over and over again; each\nviewing revealing more about both\nthe people on the screen and in\nfront of it.\nThe audience is gradually given\nmore context about Charlotte (Jo-hansson) and Bob Harris (Murray),\nand so over the course of the movie can fill in more of these silent\nsnapshots with ideas about what\nthey may be thinking. Is the lonely young wife of the photographer\nthinking about leaving him now\nthat she is a college graduate and\nsearching for a career? Does the\npensive washed-out actor dwell on\nhis youth or ponder his future? We\ndon\u2019t get all the answers from Coppola, because we simply don\u2019t need\nto. It\u2019s a film that observes others\nonly as we can in real life; from\nthe outside. It is indeed \u2018an exercise in empathy\u2019 as one reviewer\ndescribed it. We can never know\neverything that goes on inside\nsomeone else\u2019s head, all we can do\nis share experiences and conversations that may tune our frequency\ncloser to theirs.\nThe choice to set the film in\nTokyo was equally clever, as the\ntone of the city mirrors that of the\ntwo lost souls: vibrant yet isolat-ed, advanced and traditional, fun\nand solemn at the same time. The\nmany facets of Japan\u2019s capital reflect those of the human condition.\nThe romantic element of the film is\nboth crucial and inconsequential;\nsomething that can only really be\nexplainedbythefilmitself.Though\nadvertised as a romantic-come-dy-drama, Lost in Translation far\noutpaces any other film falling\nunder this category, and really has\nearned the countless accolades it\nhas received. An excellent decision\nfor 17-year-old Johansson, as it secured her the Best Actress award at\nthe 2004 Venice Film Festival.\n2008. Vicky Cristina\nBarcelona\nThere aren\u2019t many films that\nI won\u2019t give a fighting chance by\nwatching the entire reel, but unfortunately for ScarJo, this was one\nof them. Chosen on a whim by my\nsister and I while travelling in Barcelona, the title alone didn\u2019t give\nus high hopes. Directed by Woody\nAllen and featuring some dicey\nacting from its main cast members,\nincluding Spectre\u2019s Javier Bardem\nand Iron Man 3\u2019s Rebecca Hall, the\nfilm documents two friends\u2019 trip\nto Barcelona during a time of personal crisis for each of them. Vicky\nis married, Cristina is not; the two\nmeet a suave (or sleazy) artist while\non holiday, and proceed to engage\nin various affairs. The appearance\nof Penelope Cruz as the artist\u2019s\nestranged ex-wife did little to improve the situation. The plot is un-satisfyingly circular, and despite\nwatching only the beginning and\nthe end we learned about as much\nabout the human experience as we\nwould have if we\u2019d seen the whole\nfilm. It feels more like a drama than\na rom-com, and even that genre assignment seems misplaced. Allen\u2019s\ntrademark is profound commentaries on the dynamics of romantic\nand sexual relationships and their\nlasting effects on people, but Vicky\nCristina Barcelona is the opposite\nlogue you expected has gone with the wind, only to be\nreplaced by the coolest shit you\u2019ve ever seen happen in\n35mm.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Citizen Kane was so popular at the\ntime, and why it has remained a favourite amongst filmmakers and film critics. But whilst technical and narrative innovation is a commonly given explanation when\npeople ask why some old film is so popular, it can a little esoteric. But Citizen Kane actually is more than just a\nbag of movie magic tricks. The script is watertight \u2013 not\na single line really feels wasted, and there are so many\nzippy one-liners in the newsroom scenes that it almost\nfeels like Leslie Nielsen\u2019s Citizen Kane. The back-to-front\nstructure works great, creating a thin semblance of\ntruth that gradually gives way to the more nuanced \u2013 but\nstill obscure - reality. It\u2019s an obvious simile to the news\nsensationalism that is Charles Foster Kane\u2019s bread and\nbutter, but it feels fresh and well placed here where it\nmight feel played-out in a modern film. And in general,\nthe fact that it was so new and innovative in 1941 seems\nto have made it age so much better.

It\u2019s a beautiful\nday, and the late September heat is almost as warm as Michele\u2019s welcome into\nher office. One of the most immediate\nthings one notices about Michele is her\ncharisma - we speak to her with more\nease than we would have thought, and\nthe interview flows more like a conversation than anything else.\nMichele Dougherty, Head of the Physics Department, is renowned for her pioneering work in planetary science, and\nher role as the Principal Investigator for\nthe magnetometer instrument on the JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) mission\nstands as a testament to her expertise and\ndedication to unraveling the mysteries of\nour solar system. In this interview, we\ndelve into Michele\u2019s remarkable journey\nandhercriticalcontributionstotheJUICE\nmission, which is poised to provide unprecedented insights into the enigmatic\nicy moons of Jupiter: Ganymede, Callisto,\nand Europa. Her work not only involves\ndeciphering the complex magnetic environments of these moons but also holds\nthe potential to reveal the presence of liquid water, an essential ingredient for the\nemergenceoflifebeyondEarth.Michele\u2019s\nleadership and scientific acumen shine\nas we explore the intricate dance of\nmagnetism and the tantalizing prospects\nof extraterrestrial oceans in an ongoing\nquest to further understand the cosmos.\nPersonal philosophy\nM: When you lead these missions, do\nyou have a personal philosophy? Cassini, for example, ran from 1997 to\n2017, it\u2019s 20 years and these missions\ntake place over such a long period of\nyour life.\nI wasn\u2019t involved in Cassini right at the\nstart, I became involved once it was\nlaunched. It was launched in 1997, and\nended in 2017.\nI see JUICE as a way of paying back for\nCassini, I wasn\u2019t involved in the initial\nideas about Cassini - in doing so I became\ninvolved in all the great science without\ngetting involved from the start. JUICE is\na payback, and I do hope I\u2019m around once\nwe get there.\nTo put it into context, we first started\nthinking about a Jupiter-like mission\nback in 2008/2009, I was asked to lead\nthe Science Definition team, put the mission together, and we sent the proposal\nto the European Space Agency (ESA) in\n2012. I then stepped back, as I wanted to\npropose to build an instrument. During\nthe COVID lockdown we started building the instrument, and then launch was\nhalfway through!\nDeveloping a magnetometer\nT: Proposing an instrument to the ESA\n- is it a competitive process?\nOh, yeah - it\u2019s a competitive pro-cess. What we did on the team is we\nlooked at the science, put together a\nmodel payload, and suggested to ESA\nthat this is what we think are the instruments needed to do the science, and used\nthat as a basis to then put out a call saying\nthese are the instruments we\u2019re looking\noutfor,youcouldevenproposeaseparate\ninstrument. It is an international compe-tition, people around the world propose,\nyou feel very nervous if you don\u2019t get cho-sen! I ensured that a number of competitors were on my team, making it easier\nfor them to choose. In the end, there were\nthree or four different teams that put forward a proposal for the magnetometer\ninstrument. Fortunately they chose us\n- and then that was the start of the hard\nwork - we said in our proposal we can do\nall of this great science - but we needed to\nmake sure we could build the instrument\nso we could actually do it - and I think we\nhave - it\u2019s a beautiful instrument - even if\nI say so myself!\nM: We spoke to Dr. Nicola Fox earlier this\nyear, head of Science at NASA, and she\ndiscussed Imperial\u2019s prestige with mag-netometers on projects like JUICE, the\nParker Solar Probe; what makes Imperial\nso good at making magnetometers?\nFrom my perspective, the most important\nthing is that we\u2019re driven by the science\nthat we want to do. We don\u2019t just crank\nthe handle and build instruments, we decide what science we want to be involved\nin, and lead, and build the instruments\nlinked to that. That\u2019s our strength, we\u2019re\ndriven by the science. We have a fantastic\nengineeringteam,butit\u2019sthesciencethat\nwe do that drives what we want to build.\nFelix speaks to Michele\nDougherty about her role as\nPrincipal Investigator on JUICE\u2019s\nmagnetometer.\nSCIENCE\nProf. Michele\nDougherty spills\nall about JUICE\nScienceEditor\nTAYLOR POMFRET\nProf. Michele Dougherty.

He established the International Centre for Theoretical Physics\nin order to educate scientists in developing countries and provide them and their\npeers in other countries with a forum for\nscientific discussion.\nWhy this? Why now?\nIt is important to place the decision to\nrename the Central Library in context.\nIt emerged out of the discussions and\nprotests following the murder of George\nFloyd in the USA. Imperial College was\nforced to confront its past, and the legacies of some of its most prominent ben-efactors.

This issue, in honour of National\nPoetry Day (October 4th\n2023), we read five\nexcerpts from works by Black British poets,\ninspired by cultural, historical, and personal\nexperiences.\n1. Kumukanda\nby Kayo Chingonyi\n\u201cIf my alternate self, who never left,\ncould see me\nwhat would he make of these literary\npretensions,\u201d\nBritish-Zambian writer Kayo Chingonyi\u2019s poem Kumukanda presents a beautiful reckoning of what it means to have\nlives strewn across countries. The ques-tions, decisions, and complications that\narise and necessitate or, at worst, demand a voice for them to be heard.\n2. A Portable Paradise\nby Roger Robinson\n\u201cAnd if I speak of Paradise,\nthen I\u2019m speaking of my grandmother\u201d\nThe announcement of Roger Robinson\u2019s collection A Portable Paradise as the\nT. S. Eliot prize-winner felt like seeing the\nsun fully descend into the horizon. An\narc finally completed by this legendary\nBritish-Trinidadian poet and musician\nwhose work has been dedicated to stringing together words describing the Black\nBritish experience into poetic forms. A\nPortable Paradise very much carries oral\ntraditions in its words. It deserves to be\nkept close, in the breastpocket, much like\nthe words of similarly great poets like\nMaya Angelou and Gwendolyn Brooks\nacross the Atlantic.\n3. A Parable of Sorts\nby Malika Booker\n\u201cOn / the strike of dawn, we skittered\nfrom shadows, the\nredeemed walking day\u2019s straight-road\ninto warpland.\u201d\nA Parable of Sorts is a different kind of\npoem, intense from the onset and persistent until its final line, when it lets off a\ngreat big exhale. This remarks the talent\nwith which tenet of Black British poetry,\nMalikaBooker,describesasceneofdance\n\u2013 rhapsody in motion \u2013 as well as displays\na range of fierce poetic techniques that\nmake the challenges of capturing dance\nin poetry seem easy.\n4. Amo Amas Amat\nby Bernadine Evaristo\n\u201cWho do you love? Who do you love,\nwhen the man you married goes off\nfor months on end, quelling rebellions\nat the frontiers, or playing hot-shot senator in Rome;\u201d\nThis poem, taken from the prologue\nof the verse novel (yes, those exist!) Emperor\u2019s Babe by Booker prize-winner Bernadine Evaristo, is a beautiful reflection\nof what can occur in the fusion between\nforms as she writes, so soulfully, an evocative depiction of a woman challenged\nabout the man she loves.\n5. The Perseverance\nby Raymond Antrobus\n\u201cI am still outside the perseverance,\nlistening for the laughter.\u201d\nGut-wrenching, powerful, and moving are words not quite able to capture\nthe weight with which Raymond Antrobus narrates his personal tale about fa-therhood. It\u2019s a beautiful poem, and one\nwhich I hope you\u2019ll read and enjoy.\nThese poems are not a definitive list, as\nthere are many more poems out there capturing the Black British experience, but I\nhope seeing this sample of what\u2019s available might get you interested in the world of\nBlack British poetry, and captured by the\ninsight and imagination of these incredible\npoets.\nTo read the full version of\neach of these poems, scan the\nQR code here:\nOur incoming Books editor\ndiscusses literature by Black British\nauthors in a new weekly segment.\nCombining the\nstanza with heritage\nBooksEditor\nFIYINFOLUWA OLADIPO\nEnvato Elements\nThe announcement of Roger Robinson\u2019s\ncollection...as the T.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n20 | ARTS 29 September 2023\nM\nany moons ago, I had the delight\nof talking to a fellow musical lover all the way from New York, the\ncradle of musical theatre itself and the\ndwelling place of many musical greats\nsuch as George Gershwin, Stephen Sondheim, and both Rogers and Hammerstein. After comparing our favourite musicals (I stand by my pick of Hello Dolly!),\nshe then went on to say that what struck\nher about London was how many adverts\nthere were for musicals based on every\nfilm under the sun, with the same title of\n[insert film here] \u2013 The Musical!. I asked her\nwhether that was also the case on Broadway, and she reassured me that you find\nit there all the time, but that she was surprised to see it here as well. She was expecting to see something fresh and new.\nI had wondered if this spree of musical\nmediocrity had indeed become an epi-demic; wondered which power ordained\nthat we should experience such delights\nas Back to the Future \u2013 The Musical! and\nShrek \u2013 The Musical!. The confirmation\nthat this was indeed an epidemic and not\nsome West End-borne plague made me\nponder how we can debase ourselves and\nwallow in the so-called-entertainment of\nan ogre belting out ballads with chord-based piano accompaniment.\nTheactorJeremyIronswroteintheTelegraph that \u2018people would rather sing a\nsong than watch quality theatre\u2019 and that\n\u2018the serious age of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s\nwere now gone\u2019. On this point I have to\nagree with him. What first popped up on\nthe musical scene were a growing number of jukebox musicals such as Mamma\nMia! and We Will Rock You.Instead of having composers and librettists handcraft\nnew music and lyrics for a gripping story,\nit\u2019s easier (and cheaper) to take existing\nsongs and throw them into a fairly basic\nplot. I will admit that some of these are\nentertaining, especially for a silly night\nout with friends, but for someone who\nwants to see something fresh and bold,\nthese do not suffice.\nThe jukebox is not a new phenome-non, in fact, we can trace its roots even to\nthe first musicals which, in effect, were\nmusicals featuring all the popular song\ncycles by famous composers. What separates the greats from the new, however,\nis that, when incorporating already popular songs into a musical, they went to\ngreat lengths to write massive orchestral\novertures, interludes, and motifs to expand on their music, as well as bringing\nin huge casts of dancers and entertain-ers. What we get from our musicals now\nis songs followed by dead silence and dialogue while you wait in anticipation for\nsomeone to start singing something else.\nFrom there, writers of new musicals\ncould see how the jukebox was beginning to outperform and so writers took\na different tack to their musicals which\nwas\u2026to just write all your songs like pop\nsongs and hope for the best. But that\u2019s\nnot enough you see, as people can be\nwary of new things, and a new musical by\nsomeone you\u2019ve never heard of could be\na recipe for disaster! To combat this, the\nsolution now is to use familiar plot lines,\nand since, on average, fewer people read\nand take trips to the theatre, film plots\nhave become the stories everyone knows.\nWith this equation we find ourselves at\nthe answer; pop songs plus film plots\nequals modern musicals.\nWhat is the solution to this situation\nwe find ourselves in? I\u2019m afraid to say\nthat there may not be a solution at all, for\na few reasons. Firstly, currently occupying most of London\u2019s major theatres for\nungodly lengths of time are the heavy\nhitters of the theatre world, Wicked, The\nPhantom of the Opera, Les Mis\u00e9rables, and\nThe Cursed Child spawned by J. K. Rowling, leaving little wiggle room for budding composers and playwrights to take\nroot and produce fresh, new musicals\nwith sublime music and inspired plots.\nMy second point is that a full-on musical with choreography, orchestras, and\nnovel composed scores are far too expensive for most theatres to stage. It is much\ncheaper to minimise cast numbers and\nbash out popular songs than it is to have\na fully orchestrated and choreographed\nfeast-for-the-eyes.\nIt looks like we may have to put up with\nour predicament of seeing [Film] \u2013 The\nMusical! sprawled across every tube station and splashed on the side of buses for\nthe foreseeable future. Despite that, I still\nhold a glimmer of hope that the continuing popularity of Sondheim (A Chorus\nLine, Les Mis\u00e9rables, and now the revival\nof Guys and Dolls) stands as a testament\nto the fact that people still want to hear\ngreat musicals, and that maybe someone\nwill soon be inspired to take up a pen and\nwrite the next best thing to hit the stage.\nWhen did jukebox and film-based\nmusicals take over?\n\u2018The theatre, the theatre, what\u2019s\nhappened to the theatre!?\u2019\nArtsEditor\nGILBERT JACKSON\nThe 2019 revival of A Chorus Line.

What kind of\nmeasures and platforms are you pro-moting?\nBasically research, because we need new\nresearch to solve problems. Without re-search, we don\u2019t know which direction\nwe are going in, how we can change\nsignificantly, [and] how we can start the\nchange. So we have developed and established an online platform called NetZeroWiki. It\u2019s open source, and everyone at\nImperial can contribute by researching\nand uploading articles there. Everyone\ncan come and make any changes they\nwant \u2013 basically fact checking \u2013 and they\ncan discuss articles. We want to create\na community [that is] environmentally\nconscious, to get everyone to speak about\nsustainability, [and] to get everyone\u2019s attention on climate issues. We will do a\nlot of talks, seminars, workshops, which\nwill be online or in-person depending on\nthe topic. If [we] want to target the Global Initiative we\u2019ll be online and the topics\nwill be quite general. If we do in-person\nevents at Imperial, they will be more ac-ademic.\nThat\u2019s really exciting, any speakers\nlined up already?\nI have some potential speakers. One is a\nresearcher \u2013 she\u2019s working on how we can\nuse AI to solve climate change. I think\nthat would be super interesting. I\u2019m also\nreaching out to different departments\nand research groups \u2014 for example, the\nGrantham Institute, the Energy Futures\nLab, and the Sustainable Gas Institute. So\nwe want to get some professors who are\nfree and willing to give us a talk.\nYou also mentioned in your vision\nstatement that you want to see more\nclimate-related improvements at Imperial, since most of your committee\nis based here. What sort of improvements do you want to see this year at\nImperial?\nI think Imperial is doing pretty good right\nnow, they have [taken] a lot of action. I\ndon\u2019t have any significant suggestions\nor ideas. I think maybe provide a shuttle\nbus, because there are some [students]\ncoming from outer London who will use\ncars. [Imperial] can buy some electric\ncars and buses, because some of the current buses are still polluting.\n[Professors] can actually opt for more\n[fuel-]efficient flights [to conferences].\nThere are some flights that already take\ntheir carbon emissions into account \u2013 using carbon credits, so they pay for how\nmuch carbon dioxide they emit. This\nmoney will be going to the sustainable\nenergy sector. These airlines are actually doing something to help the [energy]\ntransition. But the prices are, of course,\nmore expensive. Professors can definitely spend more money to be part of the\n[energy] transition. But I think it should\nbe a choice, not by force. We want people to be willing to make changes. Even\nthough [professors] have the ability to\nbuy cheap tickets, which are more carbon\nintensive, we should convince them that\nthey have a choice.\nSo you believe in changing people\u2019s\nminds, rather than making people do\nthings because they have to. Finally,\nhow can students get involved with\nthis initiative?\nThey can reshare our content [on] social media platforms to promote our in-itiative, exposing their friends and their\ncommunities to this knowledge and\nasking them them create more environmentally conscious communities. One\nperson shares to 10 people, each of those\nshares to another 10 people \u2013 if we keep\ndoing that, it will exponentially increase\nthe number of people who are being environmentally conscious. That\u2019s our ultimate aim. We already have 150 follow-ers, even though we just set up [in July].\nThese are the global members, and there\nare also committee members. If anyone\nis interested, they can sign up [to join the\ncommittee] and we\u2019ll allocate them to\ngroups which they are interested in.\nScan the QR code below to follow Towards Net Zero on social media and\nsign up to be on their comittee!\nA word cloud made using the Towards Net Zero initiative\u2019s mission and vision statements.

I was searching for something\nthat would revitalise me; something\nhearty, brothy. There I found Mama Pho.\nAs soon as you go in, you are not only\nwelcomed by the employees, but by the\naromas of herbs and meaty wafts. One of\nthe waiters was nice and knowledgeable\nenough to recommend a few dishes to\nme; I ordered Ph\u1edf T\u00e1i \u2013 a rice noodle soup\nwith rare beef \u2013 and Ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2 \u2013 deep-fried\nspring rolls filled with pork and prawns.\nCondiments were simple but effective; I\nwas served lime, mint, bean sprouts, co-riander, and chilli. Basic, but everything\nyou needed to complement your pho.\nApproximately 10 minutes after or-dering, both dishes arrived. Again, simple and effective. The Ph\u1edf T\u00e1i was beautifully displayed. The medallion-shaped\nbeef\u2019s red translucency was a centrepiece\nsurrounded by swirling indulgent broth.\nIt was perfection in its moment.\nSo why is it a paradox in a bowl? The\nbroth was clearly (no pun intended)\npacked with umami from the beef, but\nit the fresh after-taste was perfectly balanced out with herbal notes; a contradiction in a sip. This makes you want it again\nand again and again. I enjoyed my last\nsip of soup as if it was my first. But this\nwas only the tip of the iceberg. With this\ngolden foundation laid down upon my\ntongue, the specific combination of tender beef, soft noodles, and condiments\ncreates something soul-filling. Something to note is that I personally find a\nlot of restaurants serving Ph\u1edf with beef\nbrisket, but having the rare beef medallions added more joy to the bowl, due to\nits flavour and tenderness*.\nThe Ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2 was a delight to eat. The\nspring rolls had a flat, thick, multilay-ered structure, rare to find in commercial spring rolls, which made the rolls a\nmountain\u2019s worth of joy to eat. Not a tiny\nfragment was spared once I had finished\neating, and I was surprised at the preservation of the rolls\u2019 crispiness. The filling\ninside was delicious, although it did not\nseem special to me. It was delicious for\nsure, but didn\u2019t make a big impression.\nThe spicy fish sauce complementing\nthe rolls was very good, however, again;\nnothing special. Maybe I was expecting\nmore, after my experience with the Ph\u1edf;\nbut it was disappointing compared to\nFOOD&TRAVEL\nMama Pho,\nthe paradox\nin a bowl\nFoodWriter\nMINJAE KIM\nRead about Minjae\u00b4s cultural\nexperience with Vietnamese food\njust a 5-minute walk from campus.\nThe front page of the menu explains more about Vietnamese cuisine.

So my answer to her was that in\nsome ways I saw Cassini as a robot because it\u2019s got enough good software on\nboard, that it can make some of its own\nchoices about things. It can make some\nof its own decisions. And so that was my\nanswer to her. It wasn\u2019t an actual robot,\nbut the spacecraft was sort of like a robot.\nT: I must say the magnetometer boom\nis perfect.\nOf course, you know, because I told her it\nwas the most important part of the space-craft. You know, I say that when people\nthink I\u2019m joking.\nI\u2019m also not joking when I say to kids in\nthe audience, you\u2019ll be working on JUICE\ndata. I\u2019ll probably be sitting in the sunshine drinking at Gin and Tonic saying, \u201cI\nwouldn\u2019t have done it like that!\u201d Because\nI won\u2019t tell you how old I would be when\nwe get to Jupiter. You can add eight years\non to what I am now.\n8) Do you think aliens exists? We\nasked Nicky and surprisingly we\ndidn\u2019t get a yes or no answer!\nI\u2019d like to rephrase the question slightly.\nThe word alien always unsettles me. Life\nof some kind, elsewhere in our universe,\nyes. It might be bacteria, and that\u2019s part\nof what JUICE is all about, is to see whether the ingredients for life are there. And\nyou know, I was really careful, and I told\nthe team, when we presented to the European Space Agency for JUICE, \u201cYou can\u2019t\nmention the word life.\u201d\nWe\u2019re not searching for life. We\u2019re\nsearching for the ingredients for life. It\u2019s\na subtle difference, but with JUICE, we\u2019re\nnot going to find life. With JUICE, we will\nbe able to confirm whether one of the\nthree, or all of the three moons, have the\ningredients that you need.\nAnd so for me, I think one of the most\nimportant realizations we\u2019ve come to in\nthe last 30 years is if you\u2019re looking for\nliquid water, you don\u2019t have to be close\nto the Sun to look for it. You know, in the\nlast 50 years, the focus has always been\nMars. But you can find liquid water much\nfurther away from the Sun, beyond the\nsnow line, so that yellow dashed line is\ndistance from the Sun. If you\u2019ve got liquid water on the surface, it\u2019s going to be\nice. But you can find liquid water oceans\nunderneath the surfaces.\nT: I\u2019ve seen some concepts where\nNASA want to set up some robots on\nthe surface and perhaps drill into the\nsub-surface of these oceans.\nNASA was talking about Europa lander\nbeforetheyhadaEuropaorbit.AndIsaid,\nbut where do you go to land? You know,\nyou need to do it in steps. And so there\u2019s\na NASA mission called Europa Clipper,\nwhich will focus on Europa as JUICE is\nlooking at Ganymede and Callisto. And\nfollowing Clipper and JUICE, we will\nknow where the ice crust is thinnest on\nthese moons, and so that\u2019s where you go\nif you\u2019re trying to get under the surface.\nBut you don\u2019t want to land somewhere\nwhere the ice crust is 100 kilometres in\ndepth. You know, it\u2019s a bit embarrassing.\nSo it\u2019s a step-by-step process.\n9) Lastly, what\u2019s the one thing you\nwould like JUICE to discover: is it the\npresence of liquid water or something\nmore intricate?\nSomething more intricate. So Ganymede is a really cool place to go if you\u2019re a\nmagnetometer person, because it\u2019s the\nonly moon in the solar system that\u2019s got\nit\u2019s own internal dynamo field. And so\nwhen I lose sleep, what I lose sleep over\nis how we\u2019re going to separate all these\neffects out. We need to be able to separate the magnetic field of Jupiter out of\nthe data, and that\u2019s changing all the time.\nIt\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s changing, because\nthat\u2019s what induces the electrical currents that flow in the ocean. So without\nthat changing field, we wouldn\u2019t know\nthere were actually currents there. So we\nneed to separate that up. There\u2019s lots of\nplasma in the environment that generate\ncurrents, and they generate a magnetic\nfield. Those change with time, we need\nto separate that out. Then there\u2019s the\ninternal dynamo of Ganymede, which\ndoesn\u2019t change in time, so that makes it\na bit easier. And then last but not least,\nwe\u2019ve got these induction signals that are\ntiny. The instrument is good enough. We\njust need to be ready to be able to do it.\nI want us to resolve depth of the ocean\nand its salt content, work out whether it\u2019s\na global ocean, and then with the other\ninstruments, see whether there\u2019s organic\nmaterial there as well. We can\u2019t do it all\nourselves.\nBut the other thing I\u2019m excited about\nis what we don\u2019t yet know we\u2019re going\nto find. With Cassini and Enceladus, we\nnever thought we\u2019d make that discovery.\nSo let\u2019s see what else there is there to dis-cover!\nMichele\u2019s dedication to both scientific excellence and promoting diversity in STEM is\na gift to future generations of scientists. We\nthank her for her time and wish her the best\nfor her future role at the IOP!\nFor a deeper insight into magnetom-eter technology and Imperial\u2019s role\nin the JUICE mission, simply scan\nthe QR code for Felix Issue 1824.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n12 | SCIENCE 29 september 2023\nwanted to do something else as well as\nresearch. I was approached as to whether\nI wanted to go for the role. And I thought,\nyeah, that actually sounds quite interest-ing. So I essentially will shadow the new\nPresident for two years and then I\u2019ll become President for two years.\nT: One of the big things about the IOP\nis outreach; it does lots for Physics\nEducation to disseminate the field of\nphysics. How are you intending to do\nthat?\nI think one of the things I\u2019d like to make\nclearer to people who want to become\nmembers of the IOP is that you don\u2019t\nhave to be an academic working in physics to be a member of the IOP. You know,\nphysics is of interest to lots and lots of\npeople who are not necessarily working\nas physicists. So that would be something I\u2019d like to expand, is to have more\npeople join the IOP, just because they\u2019re\ninterested in physics. I think one of the\nthings that scientists are not always very\ngood at is explaining what they do to the\ngeneral public. And they should be, because it\u2019s the tax money of the general\npublic that\u2019s actually funding what they\ndo. I think that needs to be more impor-tant. Everyone should be doing a bit of\noutreach, just as part of their job.\nBut I\u2019m still learning. You know, I haven\u2019t even had my first meeting yet! So I\u2019ll\ngo into learning mode for the first couple\nof years. Come back in two years\u2019 time\nand ask me what my focus is going to be.\nM: Back to your point on science com-munication: I completely agree with\nyou. People have no idea how science\nworks or what scientists do. There\u2019s\njustaveryopaquebox\u2013it\u2019slikeablack\nbox almost, right? I feel like in science\nthere is a perception you have to fit an\narchetype, right, like you have to be a\ngenius, especially in physics?\nYou don\u2019t need to. I\u2019m not a genius. I\u2019m\njust, you know, quite good with people.\nAnd I surround myself with really good\nteams, you know? There was a young\nlady who did a PhD in my group many\nyears ago now, who went on to become\nthe science editor for The Times. So a\nphysics degree is a perfect way is so ver-satile, and perfect if you wanted to get\ninto journalism.\nT: I\u2019m working with Dr. Boris Leistedt at\nthe moment who is the supervisor of my\nUROP. He also came from a non-phys-ics background, and is completing\nresearch in the field of astrophysics - he\ndidn\u2019t do physics as his bachelor\u2019s.\nSo there\u2019s more of us out there!\nQuickfire Questions\nIn our usual fashion, we conclude our\ninterview with Michele by delving into a\nfun and spontaneous round of quickfire\nquestions, offering a glimpse into her\npersonality beyond the realm of planetary science and STEM advocacy. Starting\nwith summer\u2019s hot topic - Barbenheimer!\n1) Have you seen Oppenheimer?\nNo, but I really want to.\n2) Have you seen Barbie?\nNo. I don\u2019t plan to see Barbie. Oppenheimer is a long one. Just going back to\nthat friend and colleague of mine, when\nshe did her PhD Viva, she did it at Harvard many years ago, and her supervisor\nknew Oppenheimer. And he was in town\non the day of her Viva, and so he came to\nthe celebratory dinner afterwards. She\ndid say to me - it was by the time when he\nrealised what the impact of the bomb had\nbeen and how the world was changing,\nand he didn\u2019t seem a very happy person.\nNo, I\u2019m really looking forward to\nwatching it, you\u2019ve got to steal yourself in\na way, because three hours is a long time.\nI\u2019m more getting excited about the Rugby\nWorld Cup.\n3) Do you have a favourite book?\nMy confession is that when I want to re-lax, I read crime stories. But what I also\ndo, and I\u2019m quite weird, is I will go back\nand read books, because it\u2019s very relaxing\nto read a book that you know what the\noutcome is. But also, it means that you\nactually, in some ways, I enjoy the book\nmore, because you see nuances in it that\nyou didn\u2019t see in the first run-through,\nbecause I\u2019m very impatient. When I read\na book, I want to get to the end. So if I\nread it a second time, then I see things\nin it that I didn\u2019t see. Hmm\u2026 the single\nbook I\u2019d take on a desert island with me\u2026\nI think it would be Lord of the Rings. That\nwas our night-time reading. When I was\na kid, and my sister was a kid as well, my\ndad read Lord of the Rings. And so I got a\nvery soft spot for it. But because it\u2019s such\na long book, it would keep me going for\na while on a desert island. Crime novels\nand Lord of the Rings!\n4) Favourite place on/near campus?\nI love Hyde Park. I go running in the\nmorning in Hyde Park. And when I\u2019ve\nsometimes had really difficult meetings\nas head of department, I will sometimes\ngo for a walk in Hyde Park afterwards just\nto clear my head. But you know, I also\nquite like to view it from this office.\n5) How long have you been in this of-fice?\nI started the job in January 2018. So five\nand a half years. Not that I\u2019m counting,\nI\u2019ve got 483 days left in the job. I\u2019ve got a\ncountdown clock.\nM: It\u2019s like the five minutes to midnight clock, isn\u2019t it?\n(In the corner of her room, next to her\ndesk, and a fat stack of papers is a rather\naustere-looking clock. Counting down.\nIt\u2019s an interesting way to think of things.)\n6) Favourite museum in South Ken?\nI think the Science Museum, if I had to\nchoose, but it\u2019s really interesting. I\u2019ve\nworked here for 30 odd years. Gee - it\u2019s\nquite scary! And I haven\u2019t been into the\nScience Museum more than once in a\ndecade. I think it\u2019s because we\u2019re right\nnext door. You know, people come and\nvisit London and they go to the Science\nMuseum and say, \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky you\nwork next door to the Science Museum.\u201d\nAnd I\u2019m thinking, \u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s there,\nbut I hardly ever go.\u201d\nBut I think if I had to choose, I\u2019d say the\nScience Museum. Partly because I had a\nbit of Cassini in there, the flight spare.\n7) Do you get a sense of pride if you see\na flight spare from an experiment that\nyou\u2019ve personally worked on?\nIt\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s not a very technical\nterm, I know. It\u2019s really great when other people enjoy what I do. And I think\nfor me, one of the most exciting things\nis when you\u2019re giving a public outreach\ntalk, and you\u2019ve got young kids in the\nroom who are still at school, and you sort\nof look at them and think they\u2019ll be the\nones working on the JUICE data.\nPart of the magic of speaking with\nMichele is how animated she is \u2013 she captures you with her way of speaking, moving\nher arms about in an animated way. As she\nspeaks she gets up and moves, picking up a\nframed picture on the bookshelf in the far\nend of the room.\nI mean, let me show you. I gave a Royal Institution lecture about Cassini many\nyears ago. And there was a four-year-old\nlittle girl who came up to me after and\nsaid, was there a robot on Cassini? And I\ntalked to her about it, and she then sent\nme this [a drawing of the Cassini space-craft]. So, yeah, there\u2019s Cassini, the space-Launch of JUICE spacecraft from Ariane 5 rocket on 13 April 2023. Beno\u00eet Seignovert / Wikimedia\n\n"
