Strangely enough average sports\nDarticipation rose from 11 hours'1\na week for the average undergraduate to 2 hours a week for postgraduates but this could easily be\na quirk of our particular sample.\nMuch more significant, from the\npoint of view of social part ici pat ion, is the time spent in clubs, at\nhops and in pubs both at IC and\nelsewhere in London. While a freshmen spends 22% of his leisure\ntime at IC social functions, the\ncorresponding figures for postgraduates drops to 10%. More\ndramatic is the increased use made\nby second year, third year and\npostgraduate students of what\nLondon has to offer. First year\nstudents spend only an hour a week in outside cultural activities\nand t we hours in London pubs.\nThe postgraduate student, how-ever, spends about 4 hours a week\nand 31 hours a week on these activities respectively.\nWhy then is there this progressive movement away from IC ?\nMost students feel that the variety\nand quantity of extracurricular\nactivities at IC are high but surprisingly few make any real use\nof them. Moreover, the use made\nof them declines with time spent\nin College. It appears that the\nfreshmen are attracted while their\ncolleagues have acquired a more\nword ly and cynical attitude towards the student life. As they\nmature, students look more and\nmore outside the College for entertainment and relaxation. The\nman referred to cynically as the\n'brown-b agger' who only spends a9.005.00 day at IC, may well be\nthe man who is getting much more\nout of living in London than 'the\nlads' in the Union bar, out drinking each other.\nSCIENCEMINING and\nENGINEERING\nSTUDENTS\nA similar trend to that above\nis found between students in the\nscience faculties on the one hand\nand those in engineering and mining on the other. While the no,-age science student is more active\nin his leisure, th js activity is directed away from IC. Less likely to be\nat toe union bar, ac trie batur u a yuu psi, or m IC social clubs, be is\nmore ii ice iy to be on the sports\nuei a oi engaged in an ob by, than\nhis engineering colleague.\ntie spends considerably more time\ntn an others at concerts, cinemas,\njazz and beat clubs and in London\npubs.\nATTRACTIONS\nof the\nMETROPOLIS\nLondon, as a capital city, as a world ci. tte for music, for theatre,\nas an intellectual hub, must inevitably attract large numbers of\nstudents away from the smaller and\nmure confined College life. An\nattempt was therefore made to\nestablish the numbers of those who\nwere 'IC orientated' and those who\nwere London orientated'. 'IC\norientated' was defined as he\nwhose social life and interests\nwere mainly centred on IC. That\nis of the total number of hours\na week spent in a gregarious man-ner, he who spent the majority of\nhours at IC or in connection with\nan IC activity. It was found that\nabout 26% of students were '1C orientated while 35% were\n'London orientated'. IC therefore\nas a University College, suffers\nfrom its existence in the metro pol is; but, what of the remaining 39%\nwho could be classified into neither\ngroup!' Presumably they are not,\nas has been suggested, inactive in\nevery direction. FELIX could find\nlittle that they did with their time!\nGaining little from the College, or\nthe city, they might as well be in\nthe wilderness of Sheffield or\nDurham!\nAPATHY\nand EFFORT\nTHE LADS\nAgain the eagerness of the\nfreshmen to look to IC appears,\nfor 40% of first year men were\n'London orientated', compared\nwith the ave i age of 26 %. This\ncan be partially explained by\nthe fact that 'the lads' from\nthe Union Bar while doing most\nof the organising of events in the\nCollege, nevertheless form a closed group from which most students are excluded. This fact probably discourages many from attempting to make the college\nThe question of responsibility of\na member to his community arises.\nTo put it more bluntly, are students responsible for their own\nsocial life in the College ? Clearly,\nthey are. Are we then to ascribe\nthe general disuse of existing facilities to apathy ? Not entirely\u2014for.\nimperial College lacks several\nfacilities which make the other\nUiversity of London colleges at-tractive. One is the lack of women:\nsingle girls at IC are outnumbered\nby their male colleagues by at\nleast 14 to 1, making IC an essentially male preserve. There is\nalso the question of ac com mod at ion. The average student lives 3\nmiles from the College and requires over 20 minutes travel time to\nget to and fro. This fact must, together with the lack of women,\ndiscourages many from returning to\nIC in the evening.\nWhat can be done to improve the state of students here ?\nClearly the greatest priority must be\ngiven to accommodation on the\ncampus. For the most part, how-ever, responsibility for improv ment lies with the student himself. The\nUniversity of London, despite its\nwide programme of cultural and\nsocial activities is almost totally\ndisregarded by IC students. \\s for\nwomen, we have the Royal Collect\nof Art and numerous secretarial colleges next door.

    "content": "FELIX 15\nAT LAST THE SPORTS\nCENTRE IS STARTED\nWork has now begun on the new Sports centre which will occupy\nthe site formerly known as 1-7 Princes' Gardens, but what will\nit include ? When will it be finished, and who is going to run\nit ? These are some of the questions which FELIX thought should\nbe answered and so inquired into them.\nThe Sports centre will contain four squash courts, one 75 foot\nrifle range with a two tier firing point and a swimming pool of\nlength 82' 6\", breadth 40' maximum depth 11', nr ni mum depth\n4'. The pool will also be fitted with a three metre spring board,\nat n ree metre fixed board and a one metre spring board.\nThe ASA were consulted on the dimensions of the poo! and\nadvised against a metric pool. There will be seating round the\npool for e'g h ty people, and limited standing room.\nPLANS COMPLETED1963 The plan* which the centre is being built to at the moment were\ncompleted in 1963, and although since then there have been some\nmodifications, they have not entailed any reduction in the facilities to\nto be afforded. The delay in starting to build has been due mainly\nto pv o dec ural matters . (budgeting considerations, curtailments of public\nfinance selective employment tax etc) and not to any building or planning problems. The centre is now expected to be finished in June 1968.\nOn being asked whether he thought a gymnasium should have taken\npriority over the four squash courts, Ray Phillips, Chairman of the\nAtheletic Club's Committee, disagreed. He said, accepting the need\nfor a swimming (pool, a(. bas on able sized gymnasium could not be\nbuilt on the site available in Princes' Gardens. Also the present gym,\nif used efficiently, is adequate and will probably be adequate in the\nfuture taking into account the declining interest in sport at IC. He\nemphasised that the sports centre is just the first stage in the development of sports facilities on die campus and that it only seemed right to\ngive priority to Close clubs which had lost their facilities. There was\nthe squash club, which 'lost\" its courts to the Chemical Engineering\nDepartment, and the rifle club which lost its range to the new Biochemistry block. When asked whether the tennis club would receive\nany new courts anywhere he said that efforts had been made to fin I new courts for the tennis club, a plan to convert Princes' Gardens into\ntennis courts had been rejected and the Natural History Museum had\nturned down a request to use some of their grounds for tennis courts.\nMr Mee, the Assistant Development Officer, said that a plan to make\ntennis courts on the top of Southside Halls had been rejected as there\na^ too many projections on the roof, such as lift shafts, ventilation s etc.\nA 'Steering Committee has been set up to look into possible ways\nof running the Sports centre, and held its first meeting on December\n6th. Ray Phillips said, after the first Committee meeting that it is\nhoped to pp point a Sports centre Manager, who will probably be a young\ndiploma of Loughborough, by the beginning of next session. The Sports\nCentre will probably be run by a sub-committee of the Athletic clubs\ncommittee and will have a constitution much the same as the present\nAthletics Grounds Committee. The 'Steering Committee' will meet\nagain consider the proposals further, after members have visited Liver-,\nnool and Cambridge to see how the sports facilities there are run. Mr\nMeto has already visited Sheffield Universitv where there is an enormous\nn \u00ab\"w sports -centre and learned a great deal which can be applied to\nthe sports centre at IC,\nThe foundations of what will become ICs snorts\ncompletion is expected b v June 1968.\nPhotograph b vD. Ormiston\ncentre\u2014\nSpeaking on the general running of the Sports centre ' Ray Phillips\nsaid the swimming pool will probably be open from 9 am. to 9 pm\nMonday to Friday and 9 am to 6 pm on \"'a Saturday, though much of\nthis time would be specifically for certain clubs.\nTwo of the squash courts will also be for team use only, and two for\ngeneral use. The rifle range will be for club use only. Some of these\nproposals may be modified when a manager is appointed if he has any\nimprovements to make. The Centre will have a staff of seven people :\u2014\none Sports Centre Supervisor (Manager) two pool attendants, two basket\nroom attendants, and two porters. At the moment it seems likely that\nadmission to the pool will be similar to that at UL U where a six penny turnstile operates,\nThe next stage in the redevelopment of Princes' Gardens will be the\ndemolition of 8-15 Princes' Gardens to make way for the Northside\nHalls'. These will join with the halls which are to be built over the\nSports Centre. The Sports Centre halls will house 224 men. After\nthis a lounge 'Sports Hall' will be built behind the Northside Halls.\nThis will be much more flexible than a gymnasium and it will' be pos-sibi e to convert it for indoor football, rugby, basket ball, and tennis as\nwell as normal gymnastic activities. There will also be separate rooms\nfor Judo, table tennis, etc.\nThis is all quite far in the future however, as two of . the\n\"c cup ants of 8-15 Princes' Gardens have leases lasting until 1976. Thus\nwork will not start on the 'Northside Halls' till at least 1976, and the\nSports Hall will not be begun until after Nortiiside is finished. There\nis no starting date fixed yet even for the 1 alls above the Sports Centre\nand in fact UGC approval has not yet been received.

This was a good\nvictory for IC, as Kings recently\nWon the U.L. U. knock-out com-petition, in which IC were en-te red. Kings opened the scoring in the\nsecond minute with a goal which\nwas due to some poor marking by\nIC who were still somewhat dis-organised. However, after this set-hack ':ho College tightened and\nheld Kings for the rest of the\nquarter. In the second quarter IC\npressed hard and were rewarded\nwith a goal by K. Ong, who beat\nthe goal-keeper with a flick-on,\nwhile heavily marked. Kings then\nattacked and were kept from scoring by some good work in the IC\ngoal, by G. Mills, and the first half\nof the match ended with both\nteams level on one goal.\nIn the third quarter IC got on\ntop and went into the lead when\na Kings attack was tr oken up and\nOng went through on his own and\nonly had to put the ball past the\ntop and went into the lead when\ngoal-keeper. A couple of minutes\nlater Ong completed his hat-trick\nwith a shot from a narrow angle\nfrom the left wing. The fourth\nquarter saw IC on the defensive,\ncontent to hang on to their lead.\nThis they did, even though Kings\nwere awarded a penalty, which\nthey missed. Towards, the end of\nthe game Kings pulled back one\ngoal when IC had one pla/er sent\nout, but from the ensuing centi e IC maintained possession and\nemerged winners by 3 goals to 2,\nwith high hopes of winning the\nleague this season. . .\n\n"

Anyone interested is always welcome.\nR.W. C. The idea for a Jazz Week at IC\n(Jazz Scene '67) was born from a feeling that the enthusiasm of the\nmusicians of the Jazz Club was not\nfinding suf fci ent outlets owing to\nthe comparatively few opportunities to play before live audiences.\nThe Jazz Club at IC has in the\npast produced some very good\nmusic and musicians but lack of\nexternal stimulus can lead to the\nClub becoming introspective and\nfinally apathetic.\nIt was felt that the Jazz Club\ncould play a much greater part in\nUnion activities and involve its\nnon-musicians to a greater extent.\nThe best way to carry this out is\nto improve the Jazz Club image by\nbringing it before the eye of the\naverage Union member in as forcible way as possible. It is hoped\nthat Jazz Scene '67 will make an\nimpact on all Union members,\nparticularly those responsible for\norganising Hops, etc. It is probably\nnot realised that the average jazz\nmusician is willing to play for the\nsheer pleasure of playing, so that\ngroups from the College Club will\nnormally be happy to play for a nominal fee (or beer!).\nDuring the week of Jazz Scene\n'67, besides the presence of outside groups and personalities, there\nwill be 'Jam Session' evenings\nduring which College groups and,\nwe hope, groups from the other\nColleges will play. These sessions,\nwill be very informal and should\nprovide a lot of good music.\nJ. H. Above: The Splinter Group\nIC Jazz on view Jazz on tap\nDo you want a jazz band of your favourite style? IC Jazz Club can\nsupply it\u2014at modest prices of course. This may be a slight exaggeration\nbut certainly the jazz club spans the whole field of jazz with its present\nselection <at bands.\nThe three broad divisions of\njazz today\u2014tr ad, mainstream and\nmodern jazz are each represented\nby an ac compi shed band. In addition we have a very versatile\npiano band group, an-up-and-com-ing tr ad band and the nucleus of\na big band.\nICs tr ad band is the \"Splinter\nGroup\" led in paths between 1915\nand 1930 by John Franklin on\ntrumpet. This band emerged 'from\nthe \"Royal Garden Stampers\" of\n1964 and has gone from strength\nto strength ever since. It is regularly seen at parties, carnivals, etc.\nThe mainstream contender is\ndie \"Clay-Holt 6\" co-led by Roger\nClay on trombone and John Holt\non tenor sax. Though it has only\nbeen in existence for one term it\nhas made swift progress, probably\nbecause of its composition of experienced musicians. Again, as for\nCollege bands in general, parties\nand hops are its main dish.\nMore way-out concepts L are\navailable from the modern \"New\nBelow: The Clay-Holt 6\nBelow right: The New Jazztet\nPhotographs by D.

Usuany to be heard\nin his trio he may with luck be\nheard with his friends in quartet\nand quintet.\nLatest band\nOur latest band is a second tr ad band, the \"New Jazz Group\" under the leadership of John\nMatthews on clarinet.

    "content": "FELIX\n5\nHow many times...? Sir.\nI have just been taught how to\nsolve a Second Order Differential\nEquation for about the fifth time\nin eighteen months. I don't mind\nthe repetition all that much; after\nall, I have nothing personal against\nSecond Order Differential Equations, and they are an important\ntopic in my field of study. What\nI resent are the reasons behind the\nrepetition.\nObviously, five lecturers have\nneeded to use the method during a lecture, and weren't sure whether\nanyone else had taught it to us.\nYou'd think that anyone compiling\na course would first find out what\nwe had been taught, or alter at iv ely when we are going to be\ntaught it. I 've lost count of the\nnumber of times that lecturers or\nexperiments in practical periods\nhave used material from other\ncourses which we either haven't finished or else haven't even start-ed.\nThe other important thing in a course is of course the lecturer.\nStudents are selected on the basis\nof their academic ability; why\naren't lecturers selected on the\nbasis of their teaching ability ? Al though I like a system in which\na lazy student is not compelled to\nwork, I don't see why it follows\nthat a bad lecturer should not be\ncompelled to improve his lecturing.\nHe lectures for our benefit and if\nhe does the job badly, something\nshould be done about it. There is\nnot even any official channel that we\ncan use to tell lecturers how good\nor how bad they are.\nOf course, we do have good\nlecturers too. One of ours has just\ncompleted twenty lectures, accompanied by an almost verbatim transcript running to about 150 printed foolscap sides of \"notes\", copies\nof which were circulated among\nthe audience. I enjoyed his lectures,\nbut they were almost a complete\nwaste of both his time and ours.\nFinally, there are those minor\nmatters like courses which end in\nNovember, and which we are examined on in June with no refresher\ncourse in between; courses which\nbegin in the Summer term a few\nweeks before the exams; and\nchunks of a course be ig cut out\nof an exam I suppose I will be\ntold that if we had worked harder\nduring the year these things would\nbe no ..problem. But we are at\nuniversity to learn (among other\nthings), and I see no reason to\nlearn the hard way when there is\nan easy one. The end, not the\nmeans, is important.\nIsn't it time that someone sat\ndown and actually thought about\nwhat is taught, when it is taught,\nand how it is taught ? How about\nthe revolutionary step of actually\nasking the students which courses\nare best laid out and best timed,\nand, especially, which, by name\nare the good and the bad lect ur ers, and why ? Or does nobody care\nabout the people on the receiving\nend ?\nW.H.O. claims the GPO tower\nAbove: the new siting of the Below: the reduced tower com pars to ien mascot before it was render- with a sewing needle,\nred invisible by means of RAPE.

The extra mass is\nconverted into energy and trans-, mitte d to the final site where .:\nt is\nstored until the arrival of the reduced tower.\nInto action So on Tuesday 10th January the\nThree Mascoteers, under the\nauspices of R.N. Hayfork proceeded to the foot ef the tower and\nprepared to RAPE it. The appa i at us was tested on an offensive buie\nwho subsequently crushed under a falling snowflake.\nThe tower was rapidly reduced,\nplaced in a match-box and a life-sized cardboard replica erected in\nits place so that the GPO would\nnot be inconvenienced. The\nminiature tower was carried to IC\nand by means of RAPE was reconstituted and placed in the middle\nof the Guilds Quadrangle.\nNow invisible So as not to arouse the wrath of\nthe College authorities by scarring\nthe campus with this hideous\nstructure, a permanently pola rising invisibility barrier was erected\naround the tower.\nIC is proud to have effected the,\nfirst theft of this mascot.

The\nI.C. club, who are having\ntheir most successful season\nfor many years, expected to be\nin the running for second\nplace, and hopes were high\nbefore the start. The competition was made keener by the\nfact that the race also functions as the I.C. Championships, and there was much\nfriendly rivalry between members of the constituent col-leg es. Furthermore, Mines\nwere determined that R.C.S. should\nnot have their usual walk-over and\nwere fielding a very strong team\u2014\nincluding Nick Barton, a former\nBritish junior miler and Kings College student; Tony Mason, a first\nyear Minesman of great ability;\nand 'old lag\" Howard Smith, last\nyear's IC Champion.\nThe race started fast but soon\nslowed down to become a long\nbattle against the slippery cond it ions.

Mike Hale\nIttUw to f \u00a3HX\nSouth African Universities\nSir,\nI refer to your newsletter which\ncontains the following item :\nTn view of the total lack of\nuniversities for black South Africans in Soudi Africa, it is planned\nto set up an IC South African\nStudent Appeal Fund. The aim of\nthis fund is to bring a black South\nAfrican to this country to study at\nIC for three years. The fund would\npay his fares and give him a little\ngrant for his stay here of the order\nof that given to other students at,\nIC. The carnival charity can make\nan, invaluable contribution to getting this fund well on the. way to\nthe required \u00a32000.'\nThis is not a true representation\nof the facts. Usually we would not\nfeel compelled to react to such a statement, but as a request for public money is involved, we feel\nthat perhaps you would like to put\nthe record straight. There are\nthree Bantu university colleges\ncatering exclusively for Bantu\nstudents in South Africa. They are\nthe University College of the\nNorth, catering specifically for the\nBantu peoples of the northern\nTransvaal; tie University College of\nZululand\u2014^for the Zulu nation in\nNatal; and Fort Hare, for the\nXhosa people of tire Transkej. The\nstandards of instruction at these\ncolleges are laid down by the\nUniversity of South Africa, which\n\u2022\nis*\" also the examining body.\nThe University of South Africa\nis unique in many ways. It is not\nfw ly an examining body but is also\n$, teaching university\u2014by corre sj pond en ce. Students axe from all\nnational groups in South Africa,\nt aclu ding our Bantu population,\ngroups. I should also mention that\nmany applications for enrolment in\ntoe Bantu University Colleges are\nregularly received from outside\nthe Republic's borders, particularly from students in Lesotho,\nbotswana and Swaziland\u2014so many\nin fact, that it has been decided\nto award places at these colleges\nfor & limited number of foreign\nBantu students only. The reason\nfor this is that we would rather\naccommodate our own Bantu\nstudents.\nJ.J. BEYTELL\nInformation Attache\nSouth African Embassy\nEd.: The Student Technologist# defines a university college as 'like\na university and doing university\nwork, but . . . lacking the power\nto grant degrees'.\nSir,\nI should like to take the opportunity of replying to Mr\nBeytell. As he so rightly says, the\nUniversity of South Africa is\nunique in many ways. There ara\nindeed African university colleges\nin South Africa but these would\nnot classify as universities in a sense accepted in this country or\neven in the normal white South\nAfrican sense. 40% of the students\nat these colleges are not even taking degree courses. The academic\nstandards are low and the salaries\nof the professors and lectures are\nconsiderably lower than those received by their colleagues in the\nwhite universities. Professors, for\nexample, receive \u00a3450 less per an-num. Added to this, African teachers receive less still than their\nwhite counterparts and they may\nnot in normal circumstances teach\nin a white university. Thus the\nmoney spent per head at these\ncolleges is considerably lower\nthan at other universities. Even\nthe capital cost is lower. It is\nnoteworthy that the ei mated capital expenditure on the two\ncolleges of the North and 1\nof\nZululand is \u00a3400,000 each. This\nmay be compared with the\n\u00a32,000,000 to be spent on the first\nstage of the similar institution at\nIbadan to cope with two-thirds of\nthe number of students expected\nat the two Bantu colleges.\nThere is at these colleges no\nsuch thing as university autonomy,\na freedom respected almost\ndi rough out the world this side of\ndie Iron Curtain. They are under\nthe direct control of the Minister\nfor Bantu Education.\nFor those who remain unconvinced or who would like to know\na iu u; uia tn JajaJ p moM j'ai om first instance to the Rt.

However, the\nright to with old letters from public-ation, either in part or in toto, is\n*e served. THE EDITOR reminds all contributors that copy for any issue of\nFELIX must arrive on or before\nthe Wednesday before publication.\nCE D IT OR' Somme nt Union successes...?\nSometimes it is pleasing to be proved wrong. Having spent several\nhundred words wondering, in past editorials, why the Union does so\nlittle that is constructive, I am reassured to find that there are people\nwho care. Probably the best news of late has been about Carnival.\nCarnival looks like having its best year yet if the results to date are\nto be typical of the year. Even Jerry Stockbridge, who must take a large amount of the credit for the success, confesses to being somewhat\namazed. But he alone is not responsible; probably a major factor has\nbeen die decision to move Carnival into the constituent Unions and\nthus make it part of Union life rather than just another Union organ-is ation. The Vice-PVesidents have done excellent work in ensuring\nthat the Union members have known what is going on, with the result\nthat several hundred pounds has been collected by each Union. Indeed,\nthis year the whole group of people associated with Carnival seems a lor\nkeener than was the case last year. The prospects are good; this in\nitself is a good situation, because if Carnival had done badly for two\nyears in succession, its very future existence would have been doubtful.\nToo much money? Perhaps there js a tendency among the organisers to concentrate\nsolely on the task of collecting money for this very worthwhile charity.\nThe procession is unlikely to take place because it is a great deal of\ntrouble and only raises \u00a3100 and the Dramatic Society's revue may be\nreduced to one night because it does not make very much. The organisers seem to forget tii at people take part in Carnival, not out of any\nsense of righteousness from 'doing good', but because they enjoy it.\nCarnival exists not only to collect money for charity but to provide\nenjoyment and entertainment for th\u00ab members of the Union.\nA chance for independence One of the other worthwhile events to take place this year, was the\neffort made by Rob Collinge and one or two others in preparing his\nreport (in this issue), which could materially affect the future of the\nUnion. The Robbins report makes it quite clear that the increase in the\nnumber of places in Halls of Residence should keep pace with the\nnumber of students\u2014this has not happened in general though IC is better\noft than many colleges. In the near future the number of students in\nIC is going up to 4,700 thus decreasing still further the ratio of hall\nplaces to students. Student Houses would be independent of the College,\nbeing run and owned by the Union.

Report on housing\nOver two thirds of the students at Imperial College spend more\nthan 70% of their grant on food and accommodation alone. This\nis one of the many facts revealed in a report produced by Rob\nCollingt'. a second-year engineer. The report is based on a10% survey taken last term among IC students living in accommodation\nother than the College Halls of Residence. The survey was taken\nas it was felt that the standard of student housing had declined\nto a level where the student is no longer reaping the benefits of\neducation in London.\nThe Robbins Report noted in 1963 that 'there is every sign that\nin most places the limit of available lodgings has now been reached.\nIndeed, if we consider the nature of some of the lodgings in which\ncircumstances oblige students to live, the distances that they are\nforced to travel to their work, the lack of privacy\u2014there are\ncases where three students share one study bedroom\u2014and the\nabsence of any kind of supervision, it can be said that the limit\nhas been passed.'\nThe Collinge Report found that\nonly 40% of those in the survey\nhad facilities for private study. Of\nthese, one in three lived at home\nor in other hostels of the univers-it y. The Robbins Committee observed that the student needs some\nform of privacy\u2014 a room of Jiis\nown\u2014through his university career\nand the Russell Report, produced\nrecently by Bedford College notes\nthat 'the need for privacy is not\nmere psychological or tempera-mental; it is academic*. The\nCollinge Report notes 'It must be\na matter for grave concern that\nso few Imperial College students\nthe have the conditions of privacy\nnecessary for study.'\nTraveling time\nIt was found that two-thirds ot\nstudents spend more than an hour\neach day in travelling between the\nCollege and their housing. The\naverage time spent was lj hours\nand nearly 1\n0\n% of students spent\nmore than two hours per day in\ntravelling. The report concludes\nthat these figures may account for\nthe reluctance of many students to\nmake the journey to the facilities\nof Central London and the difficulty\nmany find in taking an active part\nin the social life of the College.\nConditions\nStudents were invited to grade\nthe conditions in which they live.\nThe report concludes however, that\nthe results of this may not be accurate as many would be disinclined to admit to living in slum\nconditions and' 'fair' was taken as\na neutral answer. Most said that\nthey lived in fair conditions and\n\u2022\n> few in excellent.\nThe University Lodgings Bureau\nwas used by 45% of students but\nonly 50% of these were satisfied\nwith its service. Those who used\nit had better conditions but tended to be further away from the\nCollege. Of the many complaints\nreceived about the bureau, the\nmain one was about the small\nnumber of flats it could provide:\n.it appears that there is a large\n'demand for flats rather than digs\nor bed sitters. In view of the\ngenerally high demand for accommodation there is probably little\nthat can be done by the bureau to\nobtain higher standards.\nThe report concludes 'that the\ntypical IC student is not in an enviable position. He must pay high\nprices and has long travelling time.\nEven after this inconvenience, the\nstudent does not live in conditions\nmost conducive to study. Indeed,\nit seems strange that the Department of Education and Science continues to expand and im Drove the\nteaching facilities in London whilst\napparently, sparing little thought\nfor the students who are to use\nthem. The time for action is now.'\nStudent Houses\nDuring the current credit squeeze\nit seems unlikely that the \u00a31 million or so needed to build a Hall\nof Residence could be obtained by\nthe College. Rob Collinge points to\na solution in the form of Student\nHouses. Such houses flourish in\nthe USA in the form of Fraternities and are owned by the student\nbody and run by the residents. As\nno new buildings are required\nthey can provide student accommodation more quickly and more\ncheaply than Halls of Residence.\nIn the Kensington area many 99\nyear leases are currently about to\nfall-in and if the Union were to\nRob Collinge, Treasurer of the\nH.G. Wells Society, who conducted the survey and wrote the\nreport on housing conditions.\nJohn Dibblee, Secretary of the\nH.G. Wells Society, who investigated Fraternity House in the USA\nand the possibility of establishing\none at IC.\nbuy some property, now is the\ntime.\nThe capital cost per student is\nestimated at \u00a31,500 in this area\ncompared with \u00a32.000 for a full-scale Hall of Residence. By working in smaller units, capital of\n\u00a330.000 to \u00a350.000 would be\nneeded instead of the \u00a31 million\nfor a Hall of Residence. Running\ncosts would be covered by rents\na \u00bbd letting to foreign students\nduring the vacation.\n'Student Houses would therefore\nseem to be a solution to the lodging problem that could be implemented rapidly and cheaply if\nthe source., of capital were avail-able'.\nThe report was presented to\nCouncil at its last .'ting by\nDeputv-Prc :;dent D(.. McBain.\nCouncil accepted it and, recommended that the Welfare Officer\nPete Finch should investigate the\npossibilities of raising the necessary capital.\nNote: A deputation from NUS\nmet senior officials of the Department of Education and Science on\nthe 17th January to discuss student\nhousing.\nHardship for overseas\nstudents?\nThe Government plans for increased fees for overseas students\ncould severely effect Imperial College, which has proportionally one\nof the la ige st populations of such\nstudents. In spite of the Government scholarships fund to\nmeet the \u00a3 50 fee for overseas students with official who\nhave already started higher education courses the 3\n4\n% of overseas students in Britain who live\non \u00a340 a month or less, will be\nput in a more difficult financial\nsituation by these new measures\nas a large proportion of them are\nprivately financed. Two thirds of\nthe overseas students now in\nBritain receive no financial support\nexcept that from their families.\nOn January 3rd Geoffrey Martin,\nPresident of the National Union of\nStudents, said that the Union regretted that Ihe Department -if\nEducation and Science had taken\nsuch an important and far reaching\nstep, which will drastically reduce\nthe number of students in Britain\nfrom the developing countries.\nThe provision of places at colleges and universities for these\nstudents is one of our most valuable forms of overseas aid, but\nthe new Government measures will\nnot only deter new students com-j ng to Britain, but will..,force\nstudents already studying; he\"r# for\ncollege entrance qualifications to\nfind an un budgeted \u00a3250 extra a year or return home\u2014without a degree The existing u ust funds\nwhich , can pr r \u00ab\"ie grants for\noverseas students are already inundated with legitimate applications\n\n"

Game Hunt\nAbove: Comforth, Tapir & Co.\nRight: Howard rides the Tapir.\nCrime &\nPunishment\nPunishment may be said to be\ndeserved by the offender, or it\nmay be said to deter or reform\u2014\neach of these views will be examined in turn by Mr E.R. Honderich\nin his series of General Studies\nlectures. In the first of these he\nbegan by defining punishment and\nthen defended his definition against\nvarious lines of attack. He then\nwent on to consider the first of the\nthree justifications of punishment\u2014\nthe doctrine of re tri but iv is m. Arguing very lucidly, Mr.\nHonderich attempted to show that\nmost arguments in support of this\nview are absurd and untenable.\nHe destroyed the notion of equivalence between offence and penalty\nand also showed that the principle\nof equal treatment for equals, unequal treatment for unequal s in the\nrelevant sense, does not logically\nlead *to a view that punishment\nshould be imposed. If the criminal\nmakes himself unequal in the relevant sense, the unequal treatment might be reward\u2014and it\ndoes not even follow logically\nfrom this principle that unequal\ntreatment need be initiated at all.\nMr. Honderich thought that the\nmost forceful argument against this\nposition consisted of the assertion\nthat man should not be made to\nsuffer unless good comes of it. He\nbriefly stated the re tri but iv is t view\nof Hegel, but as this seemed to\ndepend upon moral principles having a sort of existence, this Seemed\nto him absurd.\nThis very striking lecturer, tall,\ntrans-Atlantically-accented and\nclutching a fistful of beads concluded the lecture' by perambulating himself round the lecture\ntheatre inviting comments.

Tel.: FUL 7969\nLast Friday morning the\nWooden Horse Club effected the\nremoval of the mascot of Northern Polytechnic & National College of Rubber Technology. The\nmascot is a rather tatty tapir\n(see footnote) answering to the\nname \"Horace\".\nSeveral preliminary excursions to\ntile College had made it obvious\nthat Horace did not like his surroundings there-\u2014after all, how\nwould you like to be chained up\nin a dingy Union lounge r This resulted in its removal to the rather\nmore pleasant surroundings of IC.\nThe Club decided that the removal could most effectively be\ncarried out during the first few\nminutes after the Union opened.\nTwenty Wooden Horse Club members duly arrived at 8.30 and enjoyed a cup of coffee in the Poly\nCafe opposite, some even had\nbreakfast.\n\u2022 The tapir was removed by cutting the case-hardened steel chains\nwhich used to secure it to a railing arrangement around him. The\nmascot was then transported, via\nan emergency exit, to a waiting\nvan parked nearby. ' Unfortunately\nHorace was too big to fit inside\nthe van while still attached to his\nstand, so this was carefully removed and sent back in another van.\nAfter posing for photographs in\nfront of the College, comp lite with\ncloe k tower, which was .two r xu \u00bbute s slow at the time, the successful\nuia a coLe ers returned to IC.\nHorace was later displayed in\nthe bar and seemed to take an instant liking to Howard, as the\npicture shows.\n\"The mascot was not damaged\nduring the raid and the first clue\nhas adal rey been set, so, if Horace\nis to be returned to its owners it\nseems they have got to do a bit\nof detective work\nApparently, stuffed tapirs are relatively rare items these days and\nwe are informed that the Zoology\ndepartment does not possess one.\nIt seems a pity that it has got to\nbe returned.\nA tapir is a distant relative of\nthe elephant and looks rather like\na long-nosed pig.

The article was removed and replaced by a letter\nfrom the Vice-Chancellor.\nGuild officials thought that this\nwould be the end of the matter,\nbut the University Council went\non \"to ask the Guild to provide\nthe Registrar with copies of all\nGuild publications immediately on\npublication\", instructed \"each copy\nof 'Wall' to be signed and certified\nby the president of the Guild or\nthe available Guild officer next in\nseniority\", and informed 'the\nGuild that if matter appears in\nGuild publications which is judged\nby the University to be offensive\nto members of the University staff\nor a hindrance to them in the performance of their duties, the\nCouncil will hold the author, editor and Guild liable to University\ndisciplinary measures.\"\nPresident Tony Klug commented\nthat the events \"Must not be interpreted as a weakening in the\nGuild's long-standing reputation of\nresponsibility, but rather as revealing an inadequacy in the Guild's present m aclu nery for the control\nof its publications. It is the\nGuild's responsibility to improve\nits own control.\"\nConflict at\nLoughborough\nThe question \"who holds the\nwhip ?\" has been raised at Loughborough following the rustica tion of three students for the removal\nof a sign at a Nottingham hall.\nThe Union Council argues that it\nwould have been more appropriate\nhad it meted out punishment\u2014\nsuspension from the Union for a term and a fine of not less than\nfive pounds\u2014but the pro-Vice-Chancellor considered this a case\nwhere the university's prestige and\nreputation were involved.\nOf the Union Disciplinary Committee he said, \"It might be as\nwell if the UDC confined itself\nto matters directly concerned with\nunion affairs in the first instance.\nWhen the committee has gained\nsome experience it will probably\nbe able to take complete control\nof discipline.\"\nReviewing NUS membership\nNewcastle University is reviewing its attitude towards the National Union of Students. By three\nvotes, however, the Students' Representative Council rejected a proposal that the NUS committee\nbe disbanded and its functions\nbe taken over by the SRC welfare\ncommittee.\nThe rejection of a change to a single transferable voting system\nat the recent NUS conference aggravated Newcastle's situation. The\nUnion in November stated that it\nmay review its continued membership if STV is not adopted at\nEaster.\nCourier\nBungled kidnap A pressman covering the attempt to kidnap Miss South Africa\nat Cambridge in November described it as \"the most bungled\nrag stunt (he) had ever seen\".\nOnly slightly ruffled, she continued\nas planned to speak against the annual debate motion that \"beauty\nis only skin deep\"; the motion was\ndefeated unanimously.\nVarsity\nIllegal canvassing\nAllegations of illegal canvassing\nin the \"dirtiest union elections\never\" have been brought against\ncandidates for the presidency and\nlibrarianship at Bristol, who were\naccused of making a formal electoral pact and conducting canvassing\nin support of this. A Bird, who has\nbeen previously fined, by the\nunion for conspiracy to canvas,\ncommented, \"This seems to be a smear campaign motivated from\npersonal spite\"\nNonesuch\nLSE review\nof regulations\nLSE has decided to set up a committee with equal representation from the student population\nwhich will undertake a complete\nreview of the School s regulations.\nStudent buys\nfreedom\nAfter 35 days detention in a Greek prison awaiting trial following a car crash, a Birmingham\ngraduate was sentenced to six\nmonths in jail for \"murder by\nneglect\".

This\nevent has been gaining in popularity in recent years and as many\nas forty branches from universities\nall over the country sent delegates\nthis year. The International Relations Club was represented by a full delegation.\nPolitical manoeuvres have never\nplayed a great part in past UNSA\nConferences and this year was no\nexception. Delegates debated various domestic, national and international issues, first in specialised\ncommissions and then in full\nplenary sessions. The system was\nfound most satisfactory, enabling\ndelegates to examine an issue at\ndepth. The policies thus formulated on South-East Asia, Southern\nAfrica and Economic Development\nhad therefore the merit of\nthorough investigation. A major\nUNSA project\u2014Teaching of International Affairs in schools\u2014is now\nwell advanced and the report of\nan extensive survey is due out towards the end of the year. An\nemergency debate on Overseas\nStudents' fees condemned the decision and the Association decided to resist any increase.\nAll in all is was a most stimulating time.

Let him help you draw up a personal budget that will give you a chance to build up a small reserve of capital.\n2. The price of success. The more successful you are, the\nmore expenses you will have. And the more you'll need\nto keep track of where your money's going. Clothes,\nentertainment, foreign travel, children's education. The\nWestminster gives you a precise record of how you spend\nyour money and will pay all your regular bills by ' standing\norder'.\n3. When you reach the top.

Reserve parties attempting to retrieve items of gear lost\nin the snow on the mountains were\nrepulsed by die conditions; and one\ngroup spent half the night climbing down the mountain arriving at\nthe bottom, just in time to meet\nthe search party. Despite traditional New Year's Eve revels, climbing\nwent on the next day, and no\nserious falls were recorded. On the\n2nd day the club, left the splendidly well-equipped Glen Brittle hut\nonly to get stuck in snow halfway\ndown the Highlands.
