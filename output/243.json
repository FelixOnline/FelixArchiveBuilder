    "content": "FELIX\nThe Government de bac:? over the overseas studen's' fees increase continues to be\nhotly debated throughout th?\ncountry. It is rip ht that it\nshould be. It is essential that\nthe pressure of protest be mi;\ni tanned until the Government\nresolve is reversed. Seldom in\nour modern and supposedly\nenlightened community has\nthere been a more hypocritical\nand callous action, for the decision is not only a wrong and\npoor one for Britain, it is an\nimmoral one, particularly so\nfor being made by a Socialist\nGovernment\nWhat then are the factors involved in this startling de term in ation; factors which one assumes\nMr. Crosland has considered? One\nthat he undoubtedly considered,\nnudged from behind by the\nTreasury, is the saving in foreign\ncurrency\u2014estimated at \u00a35 million.\nThe Government has since stated\nthat the extra fees from overseas\nstudents from the under-develop-ed countries will be reimbursed\nto their respective countries. The\nsaving is therefore even less. For\nthis saving, partly indeed compared with, say, the total expenditure on education\u2014\u00a3177 million\n\u2014or, say, the defence bill\u2014\n\u00a32095 million\u2014the Government\nis prepared to snuff out in midstream the University or College\ncareer* ol numerous students now\nin Britain. Th.p \u00abe are the students\nsupporting themselves, or supported by private means, many of\nwhom will be unable, on it e un-able, just to gather the extra\nmon ev required. After spending\nin time, one, two, or more\nyears, in expenditure, money that\nthey could probably ill-afford, and\nin effort, innumerable hours of\nenergy, concentration and worry,\nth fy must now return to their\ncountries with nothing in return,\nexcept perhaps bitterness.\nThis, then, for them is quite\nj imply a breach of faith. It is as\nFEES IN CRc AS ESymptom of Insularity\nDAVID\nif a housewife had contracted to\nbuy a washing machine on hire-purchase; half way through the\npayments the company trebles the\nprice of the machine, threatening\nto take it away if the increase i:> not paid.\nThere are too the man/ students in the future who will now\nnot have the opportunity of an\nadvanced education hero, and it\nis this factor above all which\nseems to have been callously\nignored. There are of course those\nparochial and purblind individuals\nwho will say \"Whv should we, in\nthese islands, support the education of people from far countries,\ncountries which sometimes ma linn us ?\" An answer can be given in\npurely mercenary terms. Britain\nwill benefit immeasurably, though\nindirectly, on her investment. The\nimpact of British ideas and the\nBritish way of life on the developing minds of foreign students here\nmust inevitably be vast and t^ eir\nactions, their decisions, as they become leaders in their communities will be coloured by their ex-peri en ce. Britain will reap eventual rewards for the goodwill\ngiv>n But the real answer is far deeper and far more important. It lies\nin our capacity as human beings\nto feel; in our social conscience,\n\" ir as John Donne has said:\n'No man is an island entire of\nhimself. If a clod be washed from\nEurope, Europe is the less e...\" In Britain we are well aware of\nthis. We have a well-developed\nsense of the community. But why\nis this social conscience or community awareness confined merely\nto those within the geographical\nboundaries of Great Britain, and\nb v POTTER\nnot extended to the world com-m unity, to the whole of mankind?\nTo misquote Gertrude Stein, a man is a man is a man\u2014the same\nwhether he comes from Steeple\nBumpstead in the World, Rio de\nJaneiro or Shanghai. Just as we\nin Britain make a community decision to support each other so we\nshould extend this resolve to the\nworld community.\nWhen on amomi ng in Aberfan\na mine dump falls and slays 116\nchildren, it is not only the moth-ers, fathers and brothers of the\nchildren who sutler, it is not only\nthe people of Abcrfan who suffer,\nnor the people of Wales, but the\npeople throughout the country feel\nthe disaster and rush with aid by\nword and deed to try and fill the\ngap. But we so em incapable of\nextending this awareness one step\nfurther\u2014to the whole of humanity including those beyond our\nislands. We seem to be emotionally insensible to the fate of\nhundreds of children dying daily\nin Africa and Asia from callous\nstarvation. We save a fund of\n\u00a31,600,000 for the people of\nAberfan but in a given day send\na fraction of this for I 'he children\nof Africa, Asia and South America\nIt is this lack of awareness of\nthe whole community ( of mankind\nwhich is reflected so sadly in the\nGovernments decision to increase\noverseas students' fees. While the\ncountry taxes itself according to\nthe means of each individual, we\nas a rich 1\nit ion are not prepared\nto tax ourselves for the individuals\nbeyond our boundaries. The\namount of overseas government\ngrant aid in 1965 was \u00a3110 million (compare with Gross National\nProduct\u2014\u00a330,900 eq. million\u2014or\nGovernment Income 'eq.\u2014\u00a314,000\nmillion.)\nIt is not only capital, however\n,,i.;r.i, w l, \u201e1 yl provide | ) l]t knm v ledge, technology and li amir rg. While\" we hide smugly as a nation\nbehind (in the words of the new-Beatles' song) our \"privet-hedge\"\nmentality, while politicians squab-ble, the world knows how to produce more, how to grow more.\nThus though we are not affluent\non the American scale, what we\ncan provide above all is know-ledge, energy and \"know-how\"\nAnd one of the best ways of providing this\u2014at a small cost to\nourselves\u2014is through teaching and\neducation. We should be thinking\nof taking in more overseas stud-ents, not eliminating them.\nHence this decision is not only\nmisguided, it is immoral; immoral\nfor the malaise, the indifference\nit shows to the world outside.\nThis is all the more cruel for it\nbeing the action of a Socialist\nGovernment which purports to\nhave a sense of the community.\nIt is worse still for it appears to\nbe politically expedient. The\nGovernment must cut foreign expenditure to balance payments.\nThis is accepted. If this cut had\nbeen made in some other area\n(for example a further defence\ncut) the average voter might well\ncomplain. The average voter has\nnot complained about the overseas\nstudents' fees increase. Few votes\nhave been lost. The outcry has\ncome only from the academic\nworld I Is IC protesting vigorously\nenough ? We as a College are affected more than most, for the\nproportion of overseas students at\nIC is one of the highest in the\ncountry. Where are our elected\nleaders now, our presidents, our\nvice-presidents, our secretaries and\nthe whole top-heavy structure of\nstudent representation ? Here they\nhave a real obstacle to overcome.\nIt is a worthwhile, nay necessary\naction to protest strongly now,\nrather than organising the darts\npla ving in the Union bar, or\nquibbling over the price of the\nnext hop tickets. What are we\ngoing to do ? A petition is being\nsent round for signatures. Let -s get the maximum number of signatures on it. We can, too, join in\nthe national absence from tutorials and lectures on February\n22nd. SALAM cont\ncame mildly excited. (Compare\nthe amount spent' on high energy\nphysics with the Gross National\nProduct, or the expense in Vietnam. Physics is cheap.\"\nIt has been said that man's social development hasn't nearly kept up with his technological development. How do\nyou feel about this problem?\nHis reaction to this question revealed the hun mn Atari kn is m that\nis often associated in the public\nmind with many scientists. He\nbegan by saying that I must understand that his is the point of\nvi w of an Easterner looking at\nWestern society and not Undelr-.\nstanding how its wealth and power\ncan be so misused, or not used\nat all. With all the resources we\nhave at hand how can there be\nso much poverty and starvation in\nthe world today? Even the Western countries have economic recessions and: \"This is absurd.\nThe world is crying out for know-ledge, and goods, and we can\ngive them these. Why isn't world\nproductivity geared to making\neveryone happy?\"\nHe made the acute observation\nthat social conscious ess has risen\nto the point in England that,\nif there is gross unemployment in\nWales, the English will get excited about it. But if thousands are\nstarving 1\n,\n1 Thailand? \"Why does\neveryone think small?\" he asks.\nWhere is a global conscience?\nDo you think it is the responsibility of scientists to\nteach politicians to appreciate\nthe technological resources\nthat the v have to relieve suffering and to distribute goods\nand knowledge ?\n\"Hell no,\" he said, \"it is the\nresponsibility of scientists themselves to run the machine. Plato\nrealized this,\u2014what is it? World\norder will not come until ~Mlo-soph ers are kings and kin; are\nphilosophers.'\nHe went on to talk about tn edf s advantages of a scientist. The\ntrouble is that he seldom has the\nopportunity for making big de-c is ions. But this Salam feels is\nmore a lack of experience than\nanything else, and is e as il v cured\nOnce faced with the Problem of\nhaving to bt a statesman to take\ndecisions,\u2014a scientist could soon\nlose his narrowness and become a competent lead sr.\nHe suggested that more people\nwith scientific training should\ngo into the civil service\nand the administrative end of in\ndust ry. He quotes the case of\nFrance's rapid economic resurgence after the second World War\none reason for its speed and effectiveness was that there were\nand are, scientists and technologists at the ton, many of t 'lem\ngraduates of the Polytechnique in\nParis. The Polytechnique was founded by Napoleon to train military\nengineers, but many now go into\nthe civil service and industry.\nThese scientifically trained men\nfoi m the backbone of France's de-velo p ment. \"Imperial College should consciously de ve looe this role in\nBritain\", be said. We should encourage people from IC to eet into position of responsibility,\nnot to get buried in government research laboratories.

Inevitably this leads to the occasional production of\nan artist's less brilliant works and many Gilbert and Sullivan fans consider\nthat Ruddigore falls into this category.\nIt would be nice to be able to\nMy that the Gilbert and Sullivan\nSociety offset this by giving an\nexo ep tian i ally mter est f ng perform-ance, but unfortunately they\ndidn't. The common Imperial College occur en ce of a small audience\nprobably didn't help the actors\u2014\ndespite the steady arrival of people\nthroughout the first 40 minutes.\nAllowing for this, though, the\ngeneral impression was that while\nthe singing and orchestra had\nbeen amply rehearsed, the acting\nhad been left very much to look\nafter itself.\nEngineers in the chemical industry\ncan fairly claim to face a wider range\nof interesting problems than in any\nother industry ICI is in the forefront\nof the chemical industry and offers\nvirtually unlimited variety of opportunity in design, development, production,\nresearch, and many forms of industrial management. ICI gives each engineer\nthe chance to develop his technical and managerial abilities and\u2014\nequally important\u2014offers unlimited prospects for advancement.\nFurther information is given in\nCareers for Engineers and Careers for Chemical Engineers\u2014two leaflets in a series published\nby ICI for the information of engineers, chemists, physicists, mathematicians and statisticians\nwho are considering a career in industry.\nSend for any of these titles Careers for Engineers\nCareers for Chemical Engineers\nCareers for Chemists\nCareers for Physicists\nCareers for Mathematicians and Statisticians\nResearch Opportunities in ICI\nWrite to: Miss Huart, Staff Careers Section,\nImperial Chemical Industries Limited, London S.W.1 Good opening\nThe first act opened well, with\na well sung solo part by one of\nthe bridesmaids, played by Mary\nMacphail, and a chorus by the\nvillage corps of permanent brides-maids, who could at all times be\nheard above the orchestra level.\nThe lead actors who followed immediately afterwards were something of disappointment, not least\nbecause Rose Maybud (Susan\nBrowne) looked somewhat older\nthan Dame Hannah (Catherine\nRobinson).\nColin Davis seemed rather unhappy with his part as Robin\nOakapple, and was determined to\ntell the audience so, but he gave\na much more convincing performance in the Second Act as the\nBad Baronet.\nExactly why it is difficult to\nsay, but the whole production\nwarmed up enormously in the\nSecond Act, perhaps because this\npart of the script is much more\ndiama tic, and amenable to over-acting. Gilbert's many banalities,\nfrom being merely jn fr x ria ting became actually amusing at times\nin this act, and for this much\ncredit is due to Mad Margaret\n(Jenifer Caws) and Sir Despard\nMurgatroyd (Jaclt Hopkins), whose\nclear enunciation and carefully\ncont rb Mei d un<jer act i hg mad b the\nbest of Gilbert's often vicious\nironies.\nNot Memorable As Gilbert and Sullivan the production was entertaining as G&E is entertaining, but it was not\na memorable production of\nRuddigore.\nN.

In a detailed report n resent H by Pet\u00b0 F 'rt'-h to Union Council,\nthe sources of finance, an estimate of typical furnishing and running expenses and suitable currently available leases are given. The report,\nwhich had been given only a brief reading by the members, has been accepted with few reservations.\nMost discussion centres on the fundamental problem of finance. Tm report suggests that the best source would probably be industry and. that\nthe old students associations could be of great help with this. Chris Molam\nnoted that the Old Centralians had been keen a number of yea fs ago to\nbuild a hall for Guildsmen. This brought the objection that a single-Col-leg e hall might be unpopular, though any increase in ac como dati on would\nbe useful. The essential is that any money obtained should be without\nstrings, the proposal to have the College run the appeal was changed to\none in which it was merely s pons oie d by the College.\nThe old students' representatives showed their value in their concern\nover the legal aspect* and offered to assist.\nThe estimates are based on an lease for six months, and thus\ninitial plan for fifteen bedrooms\nwith two common rooms, and vary\nfrom \u00a32300 to \u00a33000 p.a. This\ncovers heat, lighting, water,\nlaundry, repairs and maintenance,\ninsurance and cleaners wages but\nno rates (the Union does not pay\nrates).

    "content": "FELIX\nA NEWBORN KRAKEN THE EARTH IS BASICALLY A WATER PLANET, with\nseven tenths of its surface covered by sea. Little is known of\nthis vast area, as only a minute portion has been charted. The\nmust productive areas are the continental shelves, lying no deeper\nthan 1,000 ft and representing ten percent of the ocean floor.\nToday, this region is just within reach and it is thought that\nin five years time work will be comfortably continuing at these\ndepths.\nThere is an estimated oil potential of 100,000 million tons, and the\nmajority of this could be recovered by under-water drilling operations,\nimmune to surface storms. Other mineral wealth abounds, and sea\nfarming is, at pie sent, in its infancy. Fresh water, becoming increasingly\nmore difficult to find on land, could be extracted and pumped ashore.\nThese represent a few of the -benefits which could be derived from the\nability to work under the sea.\nAt present the problem is to\nsurvive, for extended periods, under the oceans. Work on this goes\non hi America, France and Russia, and names such as 'Sealab' or\n'Coushelf are now well known. In\nthis country little is happening, or\nso it may appear. The Royal Navy\nhas stated that such work is outside its terms of reference. It is\ndifficult to imagine any one .in-dust rial concern putting up at\n.least \u00a3100,000, in an enterprise\nthat would be beneficial to the\nwhole industry, and not just itself.\nAs a university college, IC is in\na unique position to undertake\nsuch a project and stands an excellent chance of obtaining service co-operation. The designers\nwould have the whole College to\ndraw upon for information. There\nis a supply of eager and voluntary\nlabour\u2014sections of the design\ncould become official projects for\nthird year undergraduates. There\nis also a considerable wealth of\nknowledge in the Sub-Aqua field,\nand thus the capacity to man the\nproject, both above and below\nwater.\nWith this in mind the Underwater club have embarked on\nproject Kraken. This involves the\nestablishing and manning of an\nunderwater house and evaluation\nof its use for work on the British\nContinental Shelf. Additional to\nthis are t ne medical aspects of\nliving in this hostile environment,\nme testing of new ideas in underwater technology and general\nscientific studies.\nPrevious houses have been\nspherical or cylindrical in shape,\nbut IC intend to use a rectangular structure, (25'xl5' xl3' high).\nSuch a structure will be easier to\nerect, and since -the internal and\nexternal pressure will be the same,\ncarries little load. The anticipated displacement is about 110 tons\nof water, so that something in the\nregion of 60 tons of ballast will\nTwo persons will live in the\nhouse for a full fort nig nt, while\nothers will stay tor shorter periods;\nlong enough to carry out particular research work. The British\nSub-Aqua Club are keenly interested and are willing to give their\nsupport to the project. Although\nthe aquanauts are in control below\nine water, a large surface team\nwill be required. Their job is to\nmaintain the only links with the\nsurface\u2014f el jsc it jr i city land telephone!\ncables and maintaining a system\ntor safety checks.\nA model of Kraken, the house in\nweeks, below the waters of the British\nsupplies and external lighting systems\nbe required. The whole house\nm, ust be mounted on \"levelling\nlegs\" to ensure that the floor is\nhorizontal,\nTho interior is divided into\ntwo large living areas; one damp\nfor the diving equipment, workbench etc., and the other dry for\nsleeping, laboratory work, control\nand decompression areas. The air\nsupply to be used is still under\ninvestigation and will possibly be\n93% Nitrogen, 7% Oxygen. This\nwill be circulated continuously\nthroughout the two week venture,\nand thus must be cleaned and\ndried.\nmta is depth, (25-90 ft), the\npressure approaches v to 4 at mos p her es, so direct ascent to the surface\nwu i nut ue possible, w uuo u cu auge rous \"Denus . the danger\not a diver los mg the house cannot\nDe overlooked and several novel\nscn em es are being planned.

Also\nhelp from the services is expect-ed, and there will be a meeting\nwith the Navy in two weeks time.\nThen a suitable site has to be\nchosen. Three are now under consideration ; Plymouth, West Scotland, and the N.E. coast. In fact\na dive has been arranged at\nPenlee Point, near Plymouth, to\ncheck on the sea bed and other\nconditions.\nNow it appears that IC's name\nwill be added to the brief list of\nunderwater living concerns, and\nby the summer of 1968 all should\nbe working and the experiments\nbeginning\u2014quite an exciting prospect for all concerned.

    "content": "10\nFELIX\nPROF.ABDUS SALAM\nAn International by MARTIN WALKER\nFrom a distance Abdus Salam is a small Pakistani gentleman\nwith a moustache. But this appearance is deceptive. His secret-ary's attitude towards him varies from a mixture of respect and\nwonder to stark terror. \" All I can say,\" she says, \"is that he's a man of the world.\" She refers to him, in his absence, as\n\"Father\". There is clearly much more to the man than meets\nthe eye.\nA glance in Who's Who gives\npart of the answer. He is a Fellow\nof the Royal Society, Science Advisor to the President of Pakistan,\nand a member of the United\nNations Advisory Commit^e on\nScience and Technology. He was\neducated at Government College,\nLahore, Pakistan, where he took\nan M.A. in mathematics. He also\nhas aB.A. and PhD from\nCambridge, where he was a fellow of St. John's College, and\nworked under Professor Kemmer.\nHe has made 'contributions to the\ntheory of elementary particles,'\nand has received an honorary degree and several prizes for physics.\nHe is a member of the Athenaeum\nClub.\nWhen I in taT Tv Sew 'ed him, 'he\nwas relaxed and talked easily with\na sense of humour, leaning back\nin his chair with his hands clasped\nin front of him. He appeared\npleasant and easy going, but gave\nthe inescapable impression that inefficiency or inaccuracy would infuriate him. While we talked,\nthe telephone rang. T rang\nearlier,' he said. 'You'd better\ncheck with your message service.\nThey don't seem to be doing\ntheir i ob.' He rang off.\nThe atmosphere in physics at\nCambridge in 1947 was very ex-citing. The discovery or II\u2014mesons\nin cosmic Ways had confirms d Yukawa's prediction of their existence a dozen years earlier, and\nopened up hitherto und reo medi of\navenues of research. Salam was\ndoing part II of the mathematics\ntripos at Cambridge when the discovery was made. Both Professor\nF Hoyle, and his tutor, a gee1 Kist, urged him co taKe the ph ys i's tripos, though for different reas-ons. His tutor wanted to see if\nsomeone with a first in mather rf at ics could do the physics tripos in\none year: Salam could, and did.\nHe des ribes that year as ver v difficult: T hae ne er worked so\nhard, before or since.' He confessed to finding the ex peri metal work particularly tough anu in lt that he didn't hae the aptitude for\nit. But the desire 'to be able to\nlook a 'real physicist' in the eye'\nhelped him to persevere and to\nobtain a first in physics.\nPeople with first in physics did\nexperimental research and Salam\nwas duly assigned a problem to\ndo with alpha-particle scattering\nfrom tritium. But he disliked having his work depend on the whims\nof a technician, or on an act of\nGod. An experimental physicist\nmust be patient; Salam is not.\nWhen he lea\"-ned that it would\nFigure \u2014\ntake months for as upn ly cf fc r f*iu m to arrive from th\" United\nStates, he asked to be allowed to\nwork in theoreticaL physics,, something which at that time in the\nCavendish was reserved for students with only seconds or thirds in\nthe physics tripos! So, l'n1950 at the age of 25, he began research on meson theory under\nProfessor Kemmer.\nPhysics has been Salam's major\ninterest in life. He was attracted\nby the desire to understand, but\nmainly by the excitement of\nelementary particle physics. However he also reads a good deal of\neconomics and enjoys oriental music.\nHe has worked hard for Pakistan\nin the fields of scientific administration and science teaching\nTo what aim is the work in\nthis department directed ?\n... Salam replied : \"To the elucidation of the fundamental laws of\nnature.\"\nThis sounds very vague but a little thought will convince the\nreader that there was no need to\nexpand on Salam's reply to the\nquestion. Theoretical physics is\nthat simple\u2014and that comp li cat ed.\nIt has been suggested that\ntheoretical physics has become a mathematical game dean d indeed some mathematicians\nprobably approach theoretical\nphysics: if citri h if. way,i \u2014but hot\nSalam. He and Professor Matthews\nlook at mathematics from a pragmatic oo in t of view; it is a too'\nto aid in the formulation of\nphysical problems and in getting\nanswers. 'We construct the maths\nwe use as we need it to understand the physics.'\nWhat is the role of theoretical physics ?\n'I came across a good quotation on that the other day,\" he\nsaid, rummaging among some\npapers, \"but my secretary must\nhave taken it away. It goes something like this: \"Surely this is a great part of our dignity as men,\nthat we can know and that\nthrough us matter can know itself;\nthat beginning with protons and\nelectrons, out of the womb of\ntime and vastness of space, 'we\ncan begin to ude rsl and; that\norganised as in us, the hydrogen,\ntire carbon, the nitrogen, the\noxygen, those 16 to 20 elements,\nthe water, the sunlight, all having\nbecome us, can begin to understand what they are and how\nthey came to be.\"\nHe had obviously been attacked before on the question of\nwhat, if any, use was research into elementary particles. He admits that, except for those in\ncosmic rays, elementary particles\nare purely man's construction.\nThis week FELIX\nstarts a new series of articles looking into the lives\nof some outstanding personalities on the IC camp-us. In this, the first article,\nMartin Walker talks to a figure he admires, a man\nof wide international re-now n, Professor Abdus\nSalam who shares the chair\nof Theoretical Physics with\nProfessor Matthews.\nvoid of physical content or\nsignificance. Do\nSalam did not agree. 'This', he\nsaid, 'is nonsense!'\nHe went on to qu al ifv: some experimental physicists talk this way,\nThey just don't exist naturally.\nHe joked: \"There are only\nthirteen omega-minuses in the\nuniverse\u2014and we made them\nall. But who knows ? Later on\nthey may make bombs out r.l omega-minuses! But this is nonsense of course.\" He laughed.\nDo you envisage any great\nsteps forward, of the order of\nEinstein's Special Theory of\nRelativity say, in the n eir future ?\nHere he was on comfortable\nground. \"Relativistic quantum\nmechanics is right,\" he said, win,\nan air of futility, but a lot of work\nhas yet to be done.\" Salam c visages no dramatic breakthroughs\nduring the next twenty years,\npartly because in elementary particle physics we must wait for\nmachines that will enable us to\nprobe distances shorter than ten\nto the minus thirteen cm. in mat\nter, and partly because, as he\nsaid \"great break troughs are a one\nin a century thing. We've already\nhad relativity and quantum mechanics in the twentieth century.\"\nDo you think that there is\nany limit to what we can ko w about nature?\n\"Physics will never stop giving\nus surprises. But whether the surprise comes at ten to the minus\nsixteen cm. or ten to the minus\neighteen cm.\u2014who can say r\"' He\nwent on to say that we will st\noo\ndoing physics only when \"for\nsome reason we can no longer do\nexperiments.\" He gave general relativity as an example. Physicists\nlost interest in a theory of gravitation when it had been shown\nEinstein's theory satisfied the\n'three cosmological tests' No\nother experimental check on the\ntheory was possible, and hence no.\nprogress was possible. What good\nis a theory if it cannot be checked\nagainst nature? But, as he pointed\nout, a dances in technology\u2014for\nexample, satellites,\u2014.could give\nrise to new experiments and revive interest in relativity.\n\"Intrinsically,\" he said, \"we\ncan go on indefinitely\u2014somewhere or other, a breakthrough\nwill occur. But elementary particle physics may die for practical\nreasons, because the cost of\nmach mes to probe to shorter distances becomes prohibitive. Of\ncourse someone may come up\nwith an idea\u2014for a superconducting accelerator of some kind say\n\u2014 which will allow us to get tc\nvery high energies for only a few\nthousand pounds.\"\nDo you consider it necessary\nto justify the high cost of research in high energy physics?\n\"Knowledge is worth whatever\nit costs to a quire it.\" Here he be-\n"

Budget: Will Students Get Less Money? Speculation in political circles regarding the likelihood of cuts in tax allowances for children seems to be now agreed that no overall decrease of the tax allowance., will occur. However, some commentators, notably in the Sunday Times, strongly suggest that income tax allowances for children will end at age19, irrespective of whether the child is receiving full. time education art er this age, or not. This measure would obviously hit parents with children at university and particularly those parents who are responsible for paying for their children any portion of their maintenance grant.

With this in\nmind he made a' successful application to the Union for the Staff\nRuttery to be open on D and D night.

Though there are many faults ana\ncomplaints, as a whole it is carrying on well. There are Carnival,\nwhose haul so far approaches \u00a32000, the Entertainments Committee, who took great pride in announcing their profit at Council\nrecently and FELIX itself, which shows every sign of breaking-even, a situation which makes it almost unique amongst student\nnewspapers.\nIt is not only in these respects that there is high activity, with appeal\nfunds for Vietnam orphans and South African students, a lobby of Parliament and the work done on student houses, the usefulness and interest\ncf Union life increases. Whatever one's views of Mr Duckett and his\nid tal s, his enthusiasm could well be emulated by many of those not actively engaged in die Union.\nHowever, to return to finance, the need for success is greater this\nyear than ever before. When the estimates were prepared at the beginning of the year it became apparent that, unless a loan of the order \u00a31000\ncould be obtained from the College, the Union would run into debt by\nthe end of the year. The Union finance of the past two years has been\nbased on the expectation that the Union fee would be increased to \u00a37\nper person per year; in view of the recent remarks by Mr. Crosland at\nLancastei and elsewhere, it is entirely possible that this may not be forth-coming. This point was made by Dr. Weale, the Senior Treasurer, to\nhau shed Council meeting (even Phillips was silent).\n'the loan from the College has still to be settled the fee may not be\nincreased; no longer can the attitude that 'the Union can afford it' be\naccepted.\nIt is a great pity that Mr Jordan, having raised the question of the\npublicity given to Council proceedings, could not attend the most recent\nof those famous convocations. I feel sure that he would have been impressed nay, bewildered by the level of debate which takes place, from\nDavid Reich, who always gives the impression of talking rubbish own-when uttering the greatest common sense, to flippant Ray Phillips, who\nis the a no the os is of Mr Reich. Even the present strong chair cannot prevent the members chasing each other into logical cul-de-sacs off the main\nroad Seriously though they've doing a grand job!\nThe riming of this last meeting i was such that it is possible to Include\nthe eve' ts of it in the main issue. I hope Mr Jordan is satisfied\nINTERESTED EN .\nWINE\nWAR\nWOODCUTS\nThen come to the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\n13 Princes Gardens\nfor a book about it.\nOpen Term:\nMon Fri (not Wed)y10.07.0 Wednesday d10.05.30 Vac: Mon-Fri 10.0-12.0\n1.0- 5.0\nLAM LEY'S technical & general\nbooks\nart materials\ndrawing\ninstruments\nstationery\npaperbacks\n1,3 & 5.

Sir,\n\"Keep at them\" This was die\nadvice of Teremy Thorpe and\nother sympathetic M.P.s to 100 IC\nstudents taking part in the\nN.U.S./ R.S.A. lobby of M.P.s to\ngam support for the tens ot\nthousands of overseas students\nseriously hit by the Government's decision to triple fees for overseas students (\u00a370-\u00a3250). \"you\nhave a very good case and s. ii'ul d win, you must not be put off by\nnods of agreement and no act-ion.\" said Nigel Fisher, Tory M.P for Surbiton.\nThis bore out much of the\nopinion of the Radical Student Alliance( R.S.A.), who were afraid\nthat N.U.S., while saying the rigi-.t things, would tone down student\nfeelings on overseas studen rt fee\nrises to ineffectiveness. Crosland\nhad eu logi sed N.U.S. at Margate\nas a responsible, respected body\nand yet had announced these increases on the first day of the\nChristmas Vacation without consultation of N.U.S. or Universities.\nThis is what respect gains for you.\nThe plight of overseas students is\none of immediate hardship and\nmust be fought with all the vigour\nthat sympathetic students can put\ninto it. N.U.S.'s tactics of mini-protests cannot be allowed to toe\nus this particular case. This is not\nmilitancy for militancy s sake, but\nmilitancy because this is a cause\nwe cannot and should not lose. In\ntli is spirit R.S.A. assembled an\nadditional 2,000 students to swell\nthe carefully regulated N.U.S. lobby to proportions lat really made\npeople take not i cf In view of rec t press publicity on R.S.A., it \u201eeem s necessary\nthat I declare myself not a Communist. I am a Liberal and the\nmoment R.S.A. becomes the voice\nof one faction, be it Liberal, Communist or Comish National, I will\ndenounce it. Its council of 20 is\nin fact carefully balanced between\n4 each from Liberal, Communist\nand Labour (non Trotskyite) and 8\nIndependents. Many radical Tories\nhave also participated. It can only\nexist as long as it is unanimous,\nas long as it espouses causes supported by all, the moment it\nsplits, it loses its point. Thus I don't think anyone need fear a takeover by any group, the moment\nthis happens the rest would denounce it and the offending faction would be saddled with running\nOH DAD, POOR DAD,\nmamma's hung you\nin the closet,\nand I'm feelin' so sad.\nby A.

At\npresent it is very clearly sticking\nto a non-factional approach. However much the Press and N.U.S. might ti y to \"Red smear\" it, the\n30uht u u ents from 90 colleges who\nattended the inaugural convention\non Jan. 28th/29 th know how firmly it was put on this path. Of\ncourse it is political and radical,\nit strives for change, towards an\nideal of freedom and justice in\nEducation and Student life, but it\nis not partisan. When it becomes\npartisan it dies.\nR.S.A. exists to work within\nN.U.S., to save N.U.S. from itself.\nMost of all, it provides what\nN.U.S. stifles, a grass-roots voice,\na platform for anyone with something worth saying and with\nenough support. Its strength is in\nunanimity and the number of\nstudents supporting it. When an\nissue such as student loans comes\nup that IC has supported, it must\nthrow its weight in with R.S.A. and others who feel as strongly\nabout it. By covering our eyes and\ndissociating ourselves from\nR.S.A., we will ensure that it becomes what we all fear, unrepresentative, unsympathetic and ineffective , another N.U.S. Of course IC must decide on\nits own, what its attitude to issues\nis, but once it has, let it strive\nwith all of a similar opinion to\nmake its views count.\nMike Mansfield\nC ND Sir,\nOur society came in for a great\ndeal of criticism and bad reporting in your last issue. The latter\nwas prevalent both in \"That Exhibition\" and \"demagogic CND\".\nThis was obviously not deliberate\nbut has led to some of our remarks\nbeing interpreted in totally the\nwrong way.\nMay I first of all answer the\ncriticism levelled at the Vietnam\nphotographic exhibition,. We accept entirely the opinion that this\nexhibition was heavily anti-American biased. We, as a society,\nbelieve the U.S. forces are in\nVietnam illegally, a view shared\nby U Thant, and therefore can\nseparate the victim from the ag-gresso r.I do admit, however, that\nI personally did not completely\nagree with the exhibition. I\" cart-cont accept the glorification of war but in the main I am sympathetic to the N.L.F and\ncan justify their fighting. We did\nat first make it clear that this exhibition was designed by the\nBertradl Russell Pjeace Foundation\nbut were ordered by the College\nauthorities to remove all reference\nto them.\nThe reason we put up such an\nopenly biased display was because\nthis would cause the controversy\nwe wanted. In the past, taking a more neutral attitude, at great\ncost to our own consciences, we\nhave not been able to stir this\nUnion away from its sluggish\napathy. During our display I have\nheard more discussion on the\nVietnam War than I have heard\nbefore at this college. We will be,\nfollowing this up with discussions\nCont'd "

Eng. building,\nwas on Monday She 6th largely\nover-run by Libyan students from\nuniversities all over the U.K. Banners stating their demands\nwere put up outside the Embassy,\nto signify the start of a sit-down\nstrike. The banners have since\nbeen removed, but the students\nare still clustered in the gloom .of\nthe Embassy Hall. At the time of\nwriting the situation is that the\nLibyan Government has cancelled the students grants, and that\nthe sit-down strike has become a hunger strike with Mr Bashir, its\nleader, firmly committed to a showdown. IC is not represented.\nFrom what one can gather the\nLibyan Government has been\nviolet n ly opposed to the Libypn\nstudents' Union for a long time.\nStudents have been detained, refused grants and teaching fac il it ies, even wounded and killed in\nwhat the public itv handout describes as a peaceful demon strat ion' The present .strike is part of\ncampaign to force their Government\ncampaign to force Government\ninto a more tolerant and reasonable attitude.\nJ. Mullaly\nThe concern of the Union Executive for the effect that this\nchange would have on the ability\nof students from poor countries\n^or under priv il edged classes in the\nmore wealthy ones) to benefit from\nour highly developed higher educational system, was expressed in\nthe motion read by Brendan\nParker. Subsequently the meeting\ndecided to send the delegates on\nthe NUS sponsored lobby on the\n1st February. Presumably the\nidea was to have one student\nlobbyist for 1000 members up to\na total of 200. The participation\nof our three delegates (myself,\nDerek Boothman and Nitim Som)\nwas not accepted but some complimentary tickets to the NUS\nprotest meeting were supplied. At\nthe meeting a number of MPs and\nprominent academics indicated\ndisagreement with this particular\nCabinet gem. The general concensus was that the \u00a35m saved\n(the sole official reason for the\nchange) would easily have been\nsaved on some other item of\nGovernment exp edit ure. RSA Triumph\nSo much for NUS; it so happens that the Radical Students\nAlliance won the day by calling\nfor a mass student lobby of\nParliament on the same day. The\nthree official delegates and about\n100 other IC students joined this\nlobby and waited for hours out\nin the cold for the Parliamentary\nprocess to accommodate them.\nThe queue outside the House\nwas the longest I 've ever seen\nand I'm sure most of the students\nnever got into the lobby.\nHowever, well over 150 MPs\nwere seen most of whom agreed\nwith our point of view and many\nWere annoyed that the change in\nScene from the Gilbert & Sullivan\nSociety's production of 'Ruddigore'.\nReport on page 2.

The second team had\nnarrow victories against Chelsea and West Ham(l), but easily beat the\nother teams entered.\nIn the third division the College beat U.C. and Q.E. C. and at the\nfinal venue d drew with Sir John Cass. This left I.C. and S. J.C. equal top,\nand so- a deciding contest was arranged. R. Butler battled heroically for\nI.C. against a strong opponent, but after six minutes there was still no\ndecision.\nAfter ad.c us sion between the officials, it was agreed to have one more\ncpu'-cst, to continue until a full point was achieved. Keyte, a beginner\nlast term, was sent out to fight the S. J.C. man. After six minutes Keyte\nsr.or eda half point with a ko-soto-gan counter to a hip attack. The S. J.C. man now attacked furiously but eventually they went to ground, and\nKeyle held his man down for a full point.\nThus IC had made a clean sweep of the league.\nTEAMS :\u2014\nFirst team : K. Glover, R. Jackson, M. Mathews, M. Reilly, D. Shaw.\nAlso J. Gwyther and P Crossley.\nSecond team :\u2022 R. Butler, J. Gwyther, B. Connong, M. Hincher, P. Crossley.\nFINAL GAME\nAT SHENLEY on Saturday the third e even^ IC's last remaining team\nin the ULU football cup competition, went down in the semi-final to a strong UC second eleven.\nThe match opened with IC doing most of the attacking and several opportunist shots from the forwards went just wide of goal. As the game\nprogressed UC came more into it but the IC half backs held control of the\nm kl tiel d and UC never look de dangerous. Meanwhile IC kept attacking\nand after a good run tii rough the middle, Horlock was obstructed in the\npenalty area when it looked as if he would score. Soon afterwards the\nbest chance of the match was wasted, when the UC defence was caught\non the wrong foot. Perry jumped over a centre from Ebbutt, but Wellfair\nshot wide of the open goal.\nTwo minutes before half-time IC scored when Ebbutt took advantage\nof a bad back pass, and ran through to score. However, the jubilation was\nshort-lived as UC scored straight from the restart, and half-time appeared\nwith the scores equal.\nUC attacked strongly in the second half, but Hayes in goal looked un-beat able. Then some slack marking in the IC defence allowed the opposing\ncentre forward to put in an unstoppable shot, to give UC the lead.\nThe match ended with IC still atta ac king but, unfortunately, time ran\nout before they could force an equalise r. R.D. Holmes\nIMPROVING HOCKEY\nTEAM MARCH ON\nHockey: IC3, UC1\nIN THE SEMI-FINAL of the U.L. cup competition, a balanced\n1C eleven gave U.C. a lesson in hockey. After the club missed\nmany chances, Goddard twice found the goal. The first followed\na clever free hit by Phillips and the second came from good work\nbetween Mayes and AnketelL\nIn the second half a coasting IC were en erg is ed by a deserved\nU.C. goal, and the game hung in balance. A fine save robbed\nGoddard of his hat trick, but Phillips made sure from a short\ncorner shot, which no-one saw.\nTEAM : Green, Grics, Peters, Ramsel, Hill, Phillips, Barlow,\nCotton, Goddard, Mayes, Anketell.\nIC l st,1 High Wycombe 1st,0. AFTER A POOR first half of the season die hockey club has been\nshowing more promise, and after a72 win over a weak Royal Vets, die y were prepared to meet a stronger challenge when High Wycombe visited\nllar i in gl on, on Saturday.\nThe game n egan rather scrap pil y with the visitors well on top while\nIC struggled to settle down. There was little or no co-ordination in attack and the defence, several times, only just managed to keep out the\nopposing forwards. After the interval, however, the College defence\nstood firm and, building on this, the attack began to show some hint of\nth rast.A fine goal, mid-way through the second half, by Pete Cotton was\nthe only scores\u2014lea v. ng the College side feeling a trifle lucky to win.\nHowever, it the defence remains as solid, they are unlikely to concede\nmany goals, so it only requires the forwards to find some shooting power,\nto finish the season in a blaze of glory. As they are now in the cup final\nthe season cannot end as a failure.\nSaturday Next\nHyde Park Road Relay\nSaturday next is the day of the Hyde Park Road Relay, starting at 3 p.m. I ne ri y det ark Road rte lay was inaugurated by the Cross Country Club\nof the Imperial College of Science and Technology in 1949, when there\nwere 9 entries The entry has grown steadily each year to this year'sng i 're of cve i100 teams, representing universities and colleges from all\nover the country, and this year, for the first time, several from the Continent. This fixture is now the most representative of all university athletics\nfixtures and t ne largest relay race in Europe, if not the world.\nEach member of the 6-man teams will run the 3-mile course; which\nencircles the Serpentine, on roads and pathways passing through Hyde\nPaik und Kensington Gardens. The start, change-over, and finish will be\nnear the west end of Rotten Row.\nMany famous athletic personalities have taken part \u2014 Bruce Tulloh,\nRon Hill, Herb Elliot, to name a few.\nLast year saw Mike Turner and Fergus Murray racing, Mike breaking\nthe course record lor the third fear running.

The leader, Dave Sweeting, had gone ahead to recon o it re the passage and had taken a wrong turning when his light also\nfailed.\nAll concerned, not knowing\nhow close to the entrance they\nwere, decided to wait there rather\nthan risk getting hopelessly lost.\nMeanwhile at about 2.00 a.m. search parties from the remainder of the caving Club set out. Unfortunately a very thick mist prevented them finding the entrance,\nand they spent most of the night\nstumbling across the moors.

However, it will work much\nmore effectively if people know\nhow to get a complaint dealt with.\nComplaints can be divided into\nthree broad categories :\n(1) Suggestions about improving\nthe amenities etc.\nExamples of those are complaints about lack of cutlery,\ntrays, etc. and bright ideas for\nkeeping the food warmer. Put\nthese in the com n la in ts book, and\nthey can be dealt with straight-away, as such a lack is obvious on\ninspection.\n(2) Complaints about standards of\nfood. etc.\nExamp'es of these are cold\npeas, small portions, and lack of\nchoice. Please put anything like\nthis straight in the book. If one\nperson makes an v ot 'ii ese com-plaints, he could be assumed to\nbe, respectively, finicky, hungry,\nor choosey, but if ten people all\nsay the same thing, then there is\ncertainly something wrong; and\nwe can try to improve matters.\nLack of choice\nWith particular reference .o tl.e \"lack of choice' complaint, would\nyou specify which dishes are\nand what the time is. This way\nwe can more easily judge how\nmuch extra food is needed.\n(3) Complaints about a bad portion\nof food, or the price being wrong.\nExamples of these are foreign\nbodies in the food, etc. If you\nthink your meal is a really bad\none, as distinct from one of low\nstandard (see type 2 complaints),\nthen the best way to deal with\nthis is to complain directly to\nwhoever is in charge of the refectory staff at that time. If you\nask the cashier, she will tell you\nwho to see. This way you can\nget a better meal, but put it in\nthe book as well, so that we realise the meat pies, for example,\nare suspect. If you do not get\nsatisfaction from the staff, though\n1 think you will, then go stra i gY it to the refectory complaints officer,\nif possible with specimens (they\nhave been produced before).\nPrice increases?\nIf you think the price of some\nmeal has suddenly gone up, then\nplease point mis out at the time.\nIt could be a mistake, and il you\ndo something about it you could\nsave everyone from paying extra.\nThere is a fourth 'category' of\n'complaint' which gets put in the\nbook, which usually reeds some-think like 'Mooney, where did you\nlearn to cook?'

    "content": "IC THE STUDENT AND Report by the\nUniversity of London\nYouth Council\nFor the past seven years, the University of London Youth\nCouncil has been carrying out an experiment in Human Relationships. The object of this experiment has been simply to encourage students to spend part of their spare time meeting and\nhelping other young people in London who normally have grown\nup in a very different environment. Because of the advantages\nwhich a student will often have over the average London youngster,\nit is felt that there is much that he or she can do within the context of the Youth Serice, to share his or her enthusiasm for life\nwith these young people, while at the same time reaping a harvest\nof benefit from the experiences to be gathered along the way.\nImperial moves in\nAbout twelve months ago, a small committee was set up in Imperial, as a sub-committee of O.S.S., to investigate openings for\nIC students to further Youth Council projects in the South West\nLondon area. As this was the first time that students in this\narea had been involved in the Scheme, it was at first necessary to\nexam the the scope for involvement. Somewhat to the surprise\nof the Committee, it was soon discovered that, behind the Regency\nfacade of Sloane Square and South Kensington a mere 4d. bus\nride from the College, there existed two Youth Clubs which were\nin desperate need of help.\n1\nCottee bar at Oft the Record\nOff\nthe\nRecord\nAny illusions which members of the Imperial College\nYouth Council had previously\nheld about Youth Clubs and\nYouth Work were immediately\nshattered on first entering the\n'Off the Record' Club. \"This\nClub\", reports Paul Shevlin,\nYouth Council member, \"meets\nin a dimly-lit basement. The\nClubroom has a coffee bar at\none end and, on a raised floor,\na table tennis table at the\nother, the rest of the room\nbeing taken up by half a dozen\nor so girls dancing, while their\nboy friends and others look\non. Many sit, relaxed, chatting\nand drinking coffee. This is\nnot to say that there is no purpose in the Chib: far from it.\nAlthough few members involve\nthemselves in especially creative activities, there is an informal atmosphere which is\nboth pleasant and worthwhile,\nit is also true to say that the\nmembers respect the authority\nof the leader.\nNot a take - over bid\nThe students who are at\npresent visiting the 'Off the\nRecord' Club feel strongly that\ntheir reason for going there is\nnot so much to organise the\nmembers into creative activities but rather to get to know\nthem as friends. Although the\nstudent is older that the average Club member, he has\nmuch in common with him. Although often products of different environments, they\nshare a common culture, and\nby getting to know each other\nthey will be making an immense and very necessary contribution to breaking down the\nlast remains of the social barriers of our society. It can already be seen that the achievements which students at the\n'Off the Record' are beginning\nMeeting at Off the Record\n\\\nto make, far from stemming\nfrom an old fashioned mode\nof 'do-gooding', owe their\norigin to nothing more complicated than a mere desire to\nbroaden their own outlooks\nand those of some of London's young people.\nSaints\n&Sinners\nSt. Philip's Youth Club in\nEarl's Court Road offers a vivid contrast to the 'Off the\nRecord' Ciub. Richard Jeifery,\nof IC sums up the atmosphere\nas follows: \"The Club meets\nin a Church hall, but is in no\nway a Church Club. Membership is open to all, as is only\ntoo obvious on looking round\nat those who attend. The\nfacilities are adequate without\nbeing exceptional. Tab^-tennis\nis taken very seriously, and\nthere is coaching for this every\nweek. The record-player pla vs an important part in the life\nof the Club, but it does not\ntake so prominent a place as\nii does at the 'Off the Record'.\nThe dart-board, which is on\nthe stage, is used by a large\nnumber of members every\nnight. There is aT.V. room,\nwhich also serves as the vestry\nto the Church. The coffee bar\ndoes a good trade. The noise\nin the Club is deafening at all\ntimes, ^specially in the Entrance\nHall, where an extension to\nthe record-player enters into\nopen battle with the shouts of\nyoung people com in s and co-ing, drifting in and drifting\nout. In recent months there\nhas been a certain amount of\ntrouble in the Club, with some\nmembers on d rui gs. The new\nClub Leader has had wide experience with drug addicts and\ndrug addiction in general, and\nis anxious to quash this problem as soon as possible.

Motoring as a means\nof transport could never progress if it was restricted; speed restrictions\ndid not necessarily increase safety; in fact, the bunching of cars travelling\nat the same speed created danger. Speed limits of 65 to 70 mph in\nAmerica had produced cars with impossible handling : power brakes and\nsteering made them too insensitive for anything but parking. Moreover,\nspeed limits varied from state to state; there was no agreed best speed.\nThe French had the best syst square ot the speed. The Americem: there is no speed limit, but\npolice keep a close watch on traffic dangers. The answer to the\nJsafety problem is better driver\neducation\u2014the 70 mph speed\nlimit was like 'the man with the\nred flag who walked in front of\nearly cars.'\nAgainst the motion. Professor\nBuchanan proposed the \"rule of\nreason' Mr Hill's argument was\nappealing but emotional. Automobilies were a good idea, but\ncaused terrible accidents, and\nshort of rebuilding all our roads\nand ensuring that everybody\ndrove perfectly, we could only exercise care and self-discipline. The\n30 mph limit in towns had decreased the accident rate. Since\nmotorways were designed for 70\nmph ;iO-one could complain that\nthe speed limit was unfair, and\nuniformity of behaviour on t'^ em\nwas safer since at 70 mph a driver covered 200 feet before he\ncould react to danger. Moreover,\nthe energy dissipated in an accident was proportional to the\nan situation was better than ours.\nSeconding the motion, Tony\nDuke quoted statistics showing\nthat speed limits did not reduce\naccidents. For example, 76 people\nwere killed on the roads at\nChristmas in 1965, and 102 in\n1966. The Road Research Laboratory had concluded that the 30\nmph limit in towns did some\ngood, but admin jj str abV fci costs\nwere out of all proportion to the\nresults. The individual driver\nshould limit his speed to the conditions and to his skill.\nBrendan Parker, opposing, said\nthat drink prop ably affected the\nChristmas accident rate, but the\nspeed limit did not. Expert drivers might be able to drive fast\nsafely, but how many cars were\nsafe at 70 mph?\nPoints from the floor included:\n'Why should we all be restricted to\nthe same speed?\" and 'Why should\npeople die for the enjoyment of\nothers?\" Advisory speed limits\nwere proposed, as well as the\nidea that drivers should he tested\nas to their maximum safe speed.\nProfessor Buchanan concluded\nthat the argument that speed limits were unenforceable was rid io ul sous. Since motorway:, were designed for a certain speed, this\nlimit should be enforced. The\nfact that tn ere was a law against\nmurder in this country and that\nthis was broken was not a valid\nreason for doing away with the.\nlaw.\nThis produced tha retort from\nGraham Hill that the reason thai\nthe law against murder was unenforceable was that the police\nwere too busy chasing motorists.\nThe vote : 145 for, 103 against,\n13 abs tant ions. UNION:\nAssociate\nMembership\nThe membership of IC clubs\nis now to be open to non\nUnion members. This was the\noutcome of a long discussion\nat the last Council Meeting.\nThere was much discussion\nabout the report of the Commitee which originally con-s de red the problem of Associate Membership; this was\ncentred on the economics and\nwho should decide upon the\neligibility of applicants. It\nwas eventually agreed that it\nwas unnecessary to limit applications to members of approved organisations as the\nnumber of people involved\nwould not be large.\nEconomics\nThe use of the phrase \"eco nom ic subscription\" caused some concern to be expressed by some\nmembers of Council; most of hem\nrecognised the in advisability ot\nsub sidi sing Associate members at\nthe expense of others but were\nstil not satisfied. The difficulty was\nultimately resolved when Frank\nFuchs was inspired to give Council an Economic Lesson. When he\npointed out that \"economic\" implied availability and desirability\nah well as financial considerations,\nthe original phrasing of this pa -t of the report was allowed to stand.\nThe version of the report that\nwas passed allows clubs who want\nassociate members to apply to\ntheir Clubs Committee which will\nu \u00bbe its discretion about who to\nadmit an'' how much to charge.\nWhen asked by Frank Fuch< if\na letter about this dec'i in ri would\nbe sent to various institutions,\nTony Duke said that he felt it\nwas not necessary to advertise for\nmembers. There were people who\nhad already enquired about io in ing clubs and these would now be ad-mitte,\nDM. HarmS.
