Surely the reason for having\nsomebody in the chair at these meetings is that they can\ndecide who is going to speak and when they speak, so\nthat the meeting doesn't become a free for all. This isn't to be taken as a comment about the Chairman, who\nappeared to be doing his best to keep order, but about\nthose people who don't realise this and whenever they\nheard something they disagreed with felt forced to\nimmediately shout out their response without waiting for\nthe speaker to finish. As I recall, our Union supports\nfreedom of speech, which I have always understood to\nmean that everybody has the right to speak without\ninterruption (time permitting), whether other people agree\nwith what they are saying or not; after today's meeting\nit appears to me that some people think that freedom of\nspeech relies upon the ability to shout down anybody with\ndifferent opinions or beliefs to your own. I think that\nhistory has shown that the latter version can frequently\nlead to confrontation and violence; and where possible\nshould not be used for the discussion of important matters.\nHow can we expect to hold our Union meetings in this\nmanner, and not put students off of attending them?\n1 have deliberately avoided writing about the issues\nwhich caused the furor (ie the Union Bar and Snack Bar)\nas I believe that they should be discussed at an organised\nquestion and answer session with all those involved and\ninterested present, and perhaps a bit of patience from all\nthose who have questions to ask or points to make. Who\nknows, maybe if we can do this successfully and show\nthat our house is in order St Mary's will consider reopening negotiations?\n/ remain, etc:\nEddie Kiernan MRE1.\nTrue or false?\nDear Judith,\nI hope you enjoyed 'Feeliks'. I apologise for the few\ncopies which went out anonymously (under 100) but when\nthe original was printed it was intended as a private joke\nwith a small circulation. After we made the decision to\nproduce a large number of copies I agreed to put my name\nto the document.\n'Feeliks' was produced to highlight the poor quality of\nnews reporting in FELIX over the past few weeks,\nespecially when referring to Union matters. You have left\nyourself wide open to accusations of bias and selective\ninaccuracy and have no real defence. Your consistent\nbadmouthing of the Union President in supposedly\naccurate, objective and impartial news reporting is\nindefensible.\nIn last week's leading story you expressed clear opinions\nover the attack on yourself by Neil McCluskey and Nigel\nBaker whilst purporting to cover the AGM as news. It\nis a matter in dispute as to whether the meeting could direct\nyou what to do and expressing an argument in favour of\nyour side during a news story is a clear breach of your\njob description. The editorial is the place for opinions.\nThere again, does anyone take your editorials seriously\nanymore?\nIC Union is your employer. A general meeting of ICU\nis recognised as the authoritative voice of the Union until\nsuch time as its quorum (that is, how representative of\nthe students the meeting is) is challenged. This you chose\nnot to do. so you implicitly recognised the AGM at that\ntime as the voice of your employers. Surely an employee\ncannot ignore a mandate from their employer which in\nthis case did not interfere with Pub Board's beloved\nconcept of editorial freedom.\nDear Judith, please, whatever lies, breaches of\nconfidence, one-sided rants and anything else you may\nchoose to put within the pages of our beloved newspaper,\nplease keep your news reporting fair, unbiased and free\nof opinion. Otherwise surely all the Union's confidence\nin its employee may be lost forever. I am quite willing\nto go to the expense and hassle of producing 'Feeliks' if\nI feel there is need.\nYours sincerely,\nNeil Motteram, ICU External Affairs Officer,\nEditor of Eeeliks'\nIt must have taken you so much time and effort to\nproduce 'Feeliks'! I'm sure that all those students really\nappreciated it. Just for your information, I chose not\nto misuse the call of Quorum. Perhaps I will in the\nfuture...\nThe only fan letter\nDear Miss Hackney,\nBefore you come to the end of your term as FELIX\nEditor, I would like to compliment you on the standard\nachieved while you have been in the chair. I have read\nFELIX since the first issue (with some gaps), and have\nseen it go steadily downhill until during some of the last\nfew years it was something of which university students\nought to be ashamed. But during your tenure I have noticed\na big change for the better, in both content and presentation\n(the number of spelling mistakes and other evidences of\nlimited literacy has been reduced).\nI hope FELIX will always be a vehicle for independent\nbut responsible reporting and comment; but it can be that\nwithout being scurrilous, obscene or illiterate, and I think\nthat you have done a good job.\nBest wishes for your future,\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Swanson.\nCorrection\nDear Judith,\nI wish to correct any misconception which may have\narisen from the paragraph in 'Blackmail', Friday 20th May. concerning responsibility for the reorganisation of\nthe Union.\nThe facts are:\nMr Harbour-Bridge initiated and drew up the 'White\nPaper' referred to and only subsequently was I involved.\nYours sincerely,\nJen Hardy-Smith, Union Administrator.\nSmall Ads\nANNOUNCEMENTS \u2022 Environmental Soc is looking for a keen and active leader for next year.\nWe have a good list of contacts already\nso get in contact with RJ Heap, Life\nSci pigeonholes.\n\u2022 FREE IDC ribbon cable, in lengths\n10cm to 2m.

    "content": "F\"IE II It's been a jolly little week. It's been\nthe kind of week when people skip\ninto the office, give you a cheery grin,\nand then hand you a letter s lagging you off. If you want to keep up-to-date with the latest Union Office\nversus FELIX saga then turn straight\nto page ten.\nThe next three weeks' FELICES\nwill be a little on the thin side due to\na distinct lack of any copy and\ncolla tors and that most of you have\nbetter things to do than read FELIX.\nHave no fear, I will not be sitting on\nmy behind during this time as we are\nplanning a mega-big last issue to\ncome out on Wedndesday 22nd June.\nDon't miss it!\nEditorial Freedom\nWhy is my editorial freedom so\nprecious to me and to you as members\nof this students' union?\nLet me tell you a little story. Last\nsummer Pippa Salmon produced an\nexcellent Union Handbook to be sent\nto all Freshers in September. When\nshe had finished all the artwork, she\nsent photocopies to the Union\nExecutive for their approval. It's standard practice. The Executive\nwere unhappy with several things: the\narticle on women at IC was too\nnegative they felt (it was written by\nlast year's President Christine Taig);\nthe gay and lesbian article wasn't sympathetic enough (it was written by\nlast year's ICU Gay & Lesbian\nWelfare Officer): and they believed\nthat the article on the Union Bar ought\nto have been more of an\nadvertisement for the outlet (it was\nwritten by last year's Internal Services\nOfficer).\nPippa agreed to make the changes\nto the gay and lesbian article,\nswitched two paragraphs and changed\ntwo sentences in the women at IC\narticle and allowed the Executive to\nre-write the Union Bar article under\nprotest.\nSo Freshers read: 'A warm and\nfriendly if rather dimly lit room, the\nUnion Bar is a meeting place for\nfriends or somewhere for a well-earned drink after a hard day's lab/problem sheet or sporting day.'\nSounds nice, doesn't it? But it doesn't sound like the Union Bar I know.\nAnother thought experiment for\nyou. Certain Union Officers believe\nthat all Union activities should be\nwell-publicised in FELIX by means\nof full-page adverts. They say that as\nthe Union is giving us \u00a311,000 each\nyear, this service should be free of\ncharge. This sub vent ion is enough for\nan eight page FELIX every Friday.\nThe reason we can provide bigger\nFELICES is because we work hard\nfor external advertising and the\nFELIX staff spend a lot of their spare\ntime doing money-making external\njobs. So the Union, that's you in\ntheory, 'owns' eight pages each week.\nLet's take a page off for Union\nOfficer's reports and another for the\nweekly diary of events. That's six left\neach week. There are over one\nhundred clubs and societies. Let's devote one page to all the clubs and\none page to all the sports. You now\nhave four pages left. The Union\nOffice want a full page ad each week\nto publicise UG M's, regalia,\nbookshop and the trading outlets.\nEach club publicity officer is\nhankering after their .rightful boxed\nad to publicise their special event.\nLet's guarantee each club one full\npage ad each year. That's a total of\nfour pages of 'in-house' ads each\nweek. And that's your own eight page\nFELIX.\nIt sounds all incredibly exciting but\nwould anybody bother to pick it up\non Fridays\u2014and would anybody want\nto take a year out to produce it?\nFollow the experiment through to its\nlogical conclusion\u2014kill the Cat,\ncreate a Union Public\nRelations/Communication sabbatical\nwho produces an information sheet,\nruns the Union's Print Unit, does all\nthe Union's publicity, sits on the\nExecutive and duplicates Union\nminutes in his/her spare time. Life\nwould be so much easier for all the\nUnion Officers and College\nadministrators without the Cat on\ntheir backs: No one to point out their\nmistakes, inadequacies, dod gy dealings and dirty tricks. We would\nall be blissfully ignorant about what\nwas actually happening in College\nwhile we read how super-du per the\nUnion Snack Bar was and what a nice\nguy the President is.\nThe Union represents students but,\njudging by regular attendance at\nUnion General Meetings, consists of\nabout 150 people. The Union is too\ninsular, it doesn't appeal to the\nmajority. The Union Officers make\ndecisions for themselves and not the\npeople they are meant to represent.\nHowever, the FELIX Editor has to\nmeet the needs of the readership. In\nmy manifesto I stated that FELIX\nought to inform, entertain and\ncriticise in order to do its job\nproperly. I truly believe that FELIX\nhad done all three things this year.\nFrom the little feedback I do get each\nweek, most students enjoy reading\nFELIX (and all 4000 copies do get\npicked up). The only complaints I ever hear are from a minority in the\nUnion Office who believe the Libel\npage should be replaced by a 'how\nwonderful we are' page.\nFELIX is for the students, not for\nthe Union Office, and a good Union\nPresident will use FELIX as a means\nof communication without insisting\nthat the newspaper toes the Union line\non every issue. Every week I have\nallocated a page to the Union for\nOfficer's reports, notices and U GM ads. It has been severely underused,\nexcept by the Honorary Secretary,\nwho is the only one who can be\nbothered to write anything to inform\nyou of what he had been doing with\nhis time (see Annual Reports, 13th May). I believe this year's FELIX has\nallowed adequate exposure to the\nUnion and its clubs while providing\nentertaining articles on a wide range\nof student interests. Am I deceiving\nmyself?\nCertain Union Officers seemed\nintent at the Annual General Meeting\nto waste important time discussing the\nneed for a FELIX Editor's Annual\nReport when we all came to find out\nthe truth about the Union's trading\noutlets. They were concerned that\nfigures quoted in FELIX were\nincorrect, but FELIX can only repeat\nwhat others tell its reporters. What\npoint is there in FELIX distorting\nfigures?\nThe whole argument occured\nbecause I asked the President if he\nintended to write an annual report,\nand if it would be distributed in\nFELIX. Writing a report is part of his\njob description. I read it in the Blue\nBook (the Union's standing orders\nand policy document), so it must be\ntrue!\nWhy shouldn't the FELIX Editor\nwrite an annual report?\nWell, I do! The annual report I write, however, is presented to\nPublications Board and not directly to\na UGM (as are the rest of the reports).\nThe distinction is that I am not an\nOfficer of the Union. I make no\nUnion policy and I have no power in\nthe running of the Union.\nFELIX is financially accountable\nthrough Publications Board which in\nturn is accountable to the Union.\nPublications Board is a useful buffer.\nThis is why I let Publication Board\nChair Chris Martin answer questions\nasked about FELIX at both Union\nCouncil and UGMs. It is his job. I have no objections to answering\nquestions asked directly to me at\nUGMs regarding my administration\nwork as FELIX Editor and Print Unit\nManager. I do object to answering\nquestions on the content of FELIX.\nIt is not for Union Officers to decide.\nThe only power aUG M has over the\nFELIX Editor is the ability to censure\nor sack. If you think I haven't carried\nout my job description then throw me\nout, don't alter the nature of FELIX\nbecause of me.\nSo how do you as a student body\nstop me from printing what I like but\nnobody else does?\nYou tell me! That's what we have\na letters page for. (I think it's appropriate to mention at this point\nthat I have printed every letter I have\nreceived this year.) It is the letters\npage that should be used to point out\ninaccuracies, not at aUG M. We\ndropped 'The Baron' and its\npredecessor for precisely that reason.\nPerhaps, Blackmail will go that way\ntoo...\nBelieve it or not, I am quite a reasonable sort of person. I don't print anything which I believe to be\nuntrue or libellous. It is very easy for\ncertain Union Officers to accuse me\nof lying or deliberately misleading the\nstudent population, but the burden of\nproof should lie with them, not me.\nEvery contentious news story is sub-edited by two different members of\nstaff. I discuss major decisions with\nthem\u2014we bounce ideas off one\nanother. I'm very lucky that I have\nsuch a good team behind me.\nI think that 4000 of you know\nexactly what I have been doing with\nmy time this year. Ask me for an\nannual report and I 'll hand you the 29\nFELICES we have produced so far.\nBut do you know what your Union\nOfficers have been doing on your\nbehalf over the last ten months?\n2 Friday May 27th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Makes a change from the\nusual anonymous contributions. It is however a pity to\nsee that you still view fiction as fact and facts as lies. If\nyou wish to quote from Council either wait until the\nminutes are produced or record the meeting on tape. Do\nbear in mind though that sound recorded evidence is not\nadmissible in court.\nIn your letter you hold Sydney personally responsible\nfor a number of motions being passed at the meeting. May\nI remind you that there are nearly fifty members of\nCouncil, of which over thirty were present at the meeting,\nall of whom have individual votes. Can Sydney really be\npersonally responsible for the way in which these people\nvote?\nYou accuse Sydney of 'orchestrating' Council. As far\nas I am aware Sydney did not threaten any members of\nCouncil, he did not bribe any members of Council, nor\ndid he blackmail any members of Council. What he may\nhave used is something called charisma, that, combined\nwith enthusiasm may have persuaded people to see the\nlogic in his arguments. Any person tabling any motion\nat any meeting tries their hardest to persuade the other\nmembers at the meeting to pass that motion. What I think\nyou hold against Sydney is that so often he succeeds. Can\nI detect a little envy of Sydney being able to do this where\nyou can't? Yours,\nNeil McCluskey, Sydney's Side-kick.\nPS. What is better Sydney's Side-kick or Judith's Floozie?\nFalse or true?\nDear Judith,\nI read with interest Paul Shanley's letter in FELIX 803\nand am pleased to see that FELIX workers such as Paul\nare continuing to uphold the principles of true and accurate\nrepresentation of the facts in their letters as well as in the\npaper in general. However. I do feel that it is necessary\nto bring some points to your attention where Paul's habitual high journalistic standards seem to have slipped\na bit.\nItem 1: The referral back of the Pub Board colours and\nthe whole issue of Pub Board colours, was not brought\nup by Syd HB( ne Howgate) but by myself. The issue\nof the content of FELIX did not even enter my\nconsideration, but merely the fact that the award of so\nmany colours within a small body (such as Pub Board)\nis degrading the value of IC Social Colours for everybody.\nItem 2: The addition of preparation of Council/UGM\npapers to the duties of the appropriate chairman was\nnecessary since nobody was responsible for these essential\nduties as the job descriptions then stood. As for a job\ndescription changing after election, that is one of the risks\nof office.\nItem 3: While Mr Shanley would like to imply that only\na select few people he dislikes made all these supposedly\nflawed decisions, he should remember that both the above\nitems, and that of Mr Tyler's social colours were taken\nby majority vote by the whole of Council. Unlike FELIX,\nCouncil is still democratic. It should be noted that Dave\nwill still receive IC social colours this year via his award\nof a Guilds UGA.\nTo close this part of my letter, I believe Mr Shanley\nhas deceived the populace of IC by this misrepresentation\nand distortion of the facts.\nOne other matter raised by FELIX 803 I feel needs\ncomment. It is suggested in a news article that a UGM\nhas no 'practical power over the FELIX Editor' other than\ndismissal. This matter is contentious and the above\nstatement is a matter of opinion rather than a factual\nstatement. News articles are not the place for the statement\nof editorial opinion. It is my belief that the part of the\nFELIX Editor's Job Description stating that they are\n'Responsible to the UGM for...' means that a UGM can\nask for reports from the Editor. Whether this is the case\nor not. I believe that someone who spends of the order\nof \u00a310,000 of our money, and has their salary paid by\nus is honour bound to tell us how that money has been\nspent. While I support the principle of editorial freedom\nso dear to the hearts of Judith. Paul and all the other\nFELIX hacks, I also support the principle of editorial\nresponsibility, and there has been precious little\nresponsibility in FELIX this year, as many of the items\nin Blackmail, for example, prove.\nI hope that the spirit of FELIX that has prevailed this\nyear does indeed die with the arrival of next year's editorial\nteam.\nYours sincerely,\nDave Clements, SCC Chairman 87-88.\nItem 1: As far as all of us remember, it was Mr\nHarbour-Bridge who brought the subject of Pub Board\ncolours up and it was he who made the formal proposal\nthat they should be referred back. Point of\ninformation\u2014Mr Harbour-Bridge was present at the\nPublications Board meeting the week before when\nChris Martin announced how many colours had been\nawarded and he made no complaint. It was only when\nhe saw who had been awarded the colours that he\nobjected to them.\nAs far as the rest of your points regarding FELIX,\nplease read my editorial.\nSecond class?\nDear Judith,\nAs ex-residents of Rayleigh House, we've suffered\nconsiderable inconvenience from visiting estate agents and\nhaving to move in the middle of the year. Not only this,\nbut our new accommodation is very inferior and more\nexpensive.\nThe final straw came when we received our new bills\n(May 16th) which overcharged us by \u00a3 7 0 and also\ndemanded a second key deposit, though our original\ndeposit has yet to be returned to us. We went to the\nAccommodation Office to point out their \u00a3120 mistake\nand were treated as if the offence were ours. Having been\ngiven only two days to pay this bill, we inquired what\nwould happen to people from Rayleigh who had not\nreceived bills. The aggressive reply was that we all had\nreceived our bills on May 9th( not true).\nThe impression we got was that mentioning Rayleigh\nHouse opened up an old wound. We are sick of being\ntreated like second class citizens, after all, it's College\nAccommodation that's making mistakes, NOT US!\nAnnette McGrath and Lara Sherwin.\nL FELIX Friday May 27th198811 "

    "content": "TENNIS\nLondon Cup:\nImperial College 2nd team\u20141\nLSE2 This was the London intercollegiate\ntournament quarter final, and due to\nthe format of only three rubbers,\nimmediately required winning from\nfrom the three pairs. Unfortunately,\nsince this was the first second team\nmatch of the season, the form was\nslow to come.\nOur first pair, K Cheung and J Van\nVlyman went down 6-2 6-1 to the\nLSE first pair, which contained a German who was 'as hot as s**f( quote from J Van Vlyman). The\nsecond pair of M Lavelle and V Buttereit lost 6-3 6-1 to their opposite\nnumber while the third pair of\nTermanini and Harrison had a shaky\nstart but won 1-6 6-2 6-2 to restore\na little pride to the team.\nThe second team is still in the UAU\nso we may taste success yet...watch\nthis space!\nOn Sunday May 22 IC were playing\nthe University of East Anglia at\nNorwich. After surviving Vk hours\nof Andy Hill's driving IC knew it was\ntheir lucky day. IC, having arrived 2\nhours late (funny that happened last\nyear), found UEA In a very\ndetermined mood. Andy Hill and\nMark Lavelle, obviously still shakey\nfrom the journey lost a close first\nmatch to the UEA first couple. Julian\nJones and John Roberts won their first\nmatch comfortably against the UEA3 rd pair whilst Paul Skipworth and\nMike Morces had an excellent victory\n6-2. 7-6 against the UEA 1st pair. So\n3-3 going into the final round IC\nneeded to win 2 out of the remaining\n3 matches. Although battling well Hill\nand Lavelle lost very quickly 6-0, 6-1,\nputting a lot of pressure on Jones and\nRoberts to beat the UEA 1st pair.\nPlaying like men inspired they\nsucceeded winning 7-5, 6-3. This left\nSkipworth and Morcos with the\nrelatively easy task of beating the\nUEA third pair. Through numerous\ndouble faults and general poor play\nthey lost the first set 6-4. They\nstruggled to win the second 6-4 and,\nfinding themselves 4-2 down in the\nfinal set, needed inspiration. This\ncame from their team-mates and\nplaying some excellent tennis they\ntook the next 4 games to win 6-4. This\nexcellent victory leaves IC unbeaten\nin the U AU so far.

FELIX\nACING\nNext week sees the big flat race of the\nseason, the Ever Ready Derby. Being\nrun at Epsom this year, it promises\nto be a great race over the classic 1 Vi\nmiles. The present going is fast,\nwhich should favour the likes of\nUnfuwain and Minster Son, but the\nrunning of the new favourite Red\nGlow will be something of a mystery.\nHe pulled out all the stops when\nbeating Keefah, Glacial Storm and\nIC RADIO\nAs seen in last week's FELIX, we do\nhave a show every Monday at 8am and Wednesday at 1pm. And our\njingle machine is a human called\nDangle Pringle, the amazing\nbilingual human jingle machine'.\nThere will also be a sports review,\nweather report, Miles' Handy Tips,\nLetters Page, Chrissie FELIX,\nDangle. Random Call and Phil, AnnaMarie and Fez.\nSanquiro in the Mecca \u2014Dante at\nYork. That was on good ground, but\nHe struggled when failing to Minster\nSon in April. However, Red Glow is\nby the great Nijinsky, and I believe\nthat he can win on Wednesday, with\nThe Charmer, who was running on\nwell when second to Doyoun in the\n2000 Guineas, following him past the\npost.\nRecently, Minizen Lass has clocked\nup a hat-trick of good wins under\npenalty, and may well be running in\none of the class races later this season.\nDiminuendo was travelling well when\nwinning at York against reasonable\nopposition, and looks good for the\nOaks on June 4th. Siesta Key also won\neasily when beating one-time Derby\nhopeful Alkharif by 6 lengths at Bath.\nThe other Derby looming is the\nDaily Mirror Greyhound Derby on\nJune 25th. This promises to be a great\ncontest between Curryhills Gara,\nSummerhill Gem and Fearless Ace.\nHeats began on Tuesday night, and\ncontinue on THursday and Saturday.\nOdds at present are 16-1, 14-1 and\n20-1 respectfully, but I feel that\nKillouragh Chris at 33 -1 represents\ngood each-way value.\nHaving stuck my neck out, I hope\nthat you will be stacking a little of\nyour grant on the Derby, and we'll\nsee next week if I was right.\nCookery Club\nA gastronomic\nsurvey of the world\nNigerian\nConnection\nThis week we go off the beaten track\nto take a brief look at the dishes of\nNigeria. I am grateful to John\nDurodola of Mech Eng for providing\nme with an interesting discourse on\nNigerian cuisine. He made every dish\nsound tant a lising. The gastronomic jewel\u2014'MoinMoin' (pro nou ced with the n's silent).\nThis is a special steamed dish in\nwhich soaked, ground beans are\ncooked in a tomato and chilli sauce.\nShrimps, fish or liver can be added.\nI would sav our the taste of this dish\naccompanied by plain boiled rice.\nJohn told me of a Swiss lady visiting\nNigeria who became enthralled by its\ntaste and took a recipe back to her\nhome town where it took root as a 'piece de resistance' in the local\ncuisine.\nPepper Soup (very common in East\nNigeria)\u2014This soup is eaten with\nnothing to follow. One simply has the\nsoup, drinks some water and wanders\noff. The local Nigerian herbs impart\nthe kidney, liver and meat broth with\nproperties that are reputed to keep the\npiles at bay. This soup is an institution\nin the country and must be tried.\n'Fura & Nono' (North Nigeria)\u2014\nJohn insists that there is nothing more\nsoothing to drink in the fierce heat of\nthe Nigerian sun than this preparation\nof fresh milk (nono) and ground corn\n(fur a) Dodo\u2014This is a dish made by frying\nplantains over a low flame. It is\nusually eaten with rice or beans in an\nonion, tomato and chilli sauce.\n'Alewa'\u2014A sweet made from sugar\ncane that is worth trying.\nThe Great Tuber Dishes\nAnyone who has lived in West Africa\nknows the importance of tubers as a staple, food. The yam or the cassava\nbase is always accompanied by a soup\nwith vegetables and meat added. The\nchoice of base is usually either\npounded yams, 'Amala' (made from\nyam powder), 'Eba' or 'Gari' (made\nfrom cassava flour) or 'Futu' (made\nfrom cassava flour). Amongst the\nchoice of soups to accompany the\nstarch base one can expect to find\nEgusi soup (a major ingredient is a special Nigerian Melon) and Okra\nsoup.\nPlaces to eat in Lagos\nTam-Tam on Broad Street, behind\nLeventis Stores.\nRestaurant Museum Kitchen, TafaBalewa Square. The Tinubu Square\narea is a good place to find good\ncuisine at affordable prices.\nTraditional Lagos food can be tried\nin the Isale-Eko area and in the Race\nCourse area.\nInexpensive evening meals may be\nenjoyed in a number of 'Bukaterias'\non Awoiowo Road in Ikoyi even\nthough this is a posh area of the city.\nWhat Next?\nThe gastronomic survey will be taking\na look at eating in Athens, Italy and\nAmerica as soon as I have received\nenough to write about.\nBye, Yishu.\nFELIX Friday May 27th19889 "

    "content": "Unwanted\nrot\nCynical people used to suggest that\ncar manufacturers deliberately\ndesigned their cars to rust so that\npeople would have to buy more cars.\nThe same attitude in the textile\nindustry was s at iris ed in the old\nBritish film Tlie Man in the White\nCoat where Alec Guinness plays a scientist who invents an in destruct able fabric: the work force of the company\nrefused to adopt the idea because they\nthought it would leave them without\nfuture jobs. Their attitude appears to\nbe mirrored by the book trade who\nseem to design their products to\ndisintegrate after a set period of time.\nThe average paperback; even if\nlooked after well, will fall to bits in\nten years. This may be OK if the book\nis a Jackie Collins novel, but it is\nhardly acceptable if it is a textbook\nand contains useful information. Our\nstocks of scientific journals become\nconsulted less frequently as they get\nolder, but many still must be kept on\nopen access in case some vital result\nis unavailable anywhere else. If they\ncrumble to dust, vital information\nmay be lost forever.\nThe problem is actually a relatively\nmodern one. Sometime in the 1850s paper makers discovered cheap ways\nto turn wood-pulp into acceptable\npaper. This turned out to be\nconsiderably cheaper than cotton-rag.\nHowever, the machinery used for\npulping the wood left the wood fibres\ntoo short (this lowers the structural\nintegrity of the resultant paper) and\nthe chemical processing of the pulp\nleft the resulting paper acidic.\nAnother part of the paper-making\nprocess placed another time bomb in\nthe paper: one of the chemical\nadditives decomposes with time to\ngive even more acid. The acid eats\ninto the structure of the cellulose in\nthe wood fibres, making them brittle.\nThese problems are exacerbated by\nthe moisture from people's fingers,\nair pollution, unfiltered sunlight,\ncentral heating.\nThese factors turn most modern\nbooks into brittle fragile objects after\na few decades. Really old books\n(published before about 1800) are still\ngoing strong and don't deteriorate\nunless they are handled too much.\nLibraries that want to maintain their\nmodern books have a big problem.\nThey could put them all on microfilm,\nbut this is inconvenient and\n6\nexpensive. So they have been\nsearching for chemical methods of\npreserving the original bits of paper.\nOne solution involves neutral ising the acids present in the original paper.\nThis is easy for paper-makers to do\nsince they can actually incorporate\nother chemicals into the original paper\nthat neutral is e acid as it is formed. But\npublishers tend not to do this since it\ncosts more. So libraries need to get\na method to retrospectively protect\ncheap book paper.\nOne chemical method developed\nfor the American Library of Congress\ninvolves a spontaneously flammable\nchemical called tri ethyl aluminium.\nThis may sound paradoxical, but the\nchemical's reactivity is the key to its\nsuccess. The books are placed in a closed chamber, the air is removed\nand replaced by the volatile chemical.\nThe chemical slowly penetrates the\npaper, reacting with anything\nremotely acidic and leaving enough\nalkali to neutral is e any future acid\npenetration. The excess chemical is\nremoved under vacuum before letting\nthe air back in.\nUnfortunately, this method works\nbest on new books and does nothing\nfor those already halfway to dust. So,\nthe British Library commissioned\nchemists at Surrey University to\ndevelop a better method. They came\nup with something that both preserves\nand strengthens paper.\nAgain the books have to be\nimpregnated with the preservative\nmolecules, in this case ethyl a cry late and methyl meth a cry late( perspex is\na polymer of methyl meth a cry late). An antacid can also be added. The\nbooks are then irradiated with gamma\nrays which cause the chemicals to\npolymer is e and to react with the\ncellulose. This strengthens the paper\nby up to ten times, vastly increasing\nits durability. If the cocktail of\nchemicals is mixed well the the\nprocess causes no not i cable change to\nthe texture of the paper.\nUnfortunately it can cost \u00a3 5 0 per\nbook. If mass processing can get this\ndown to about \u00a3 6 per book then the\nmethod would be competitive with the\nAmerican solutions (and it can be\nused on partly degraded books).\nHowever, there is one good thing\nabout paper rot: the junk mail that fills\nup my letter rack will eventually\ncrumble to dust.\nNew hope\nfor fatties\nBeecham Pharmaceuticals have\ndiscovered the ultimate slimming pill.\nIt encourages certain cells to burn\nexcess food to produce heat. This\nshould be sheer joy for addicts of\nCadbury and Mac Donalds.\nChemicals such as adrenaline\n(produced by the body in times of\nstress to make you ready to fight or\nrun away) have been known to\nencourage useless fat burning for a long time, but they tend to give you\nheart attacks as well. Beechams\nchemists performed the trick of\nbuilding a similar molecule which\nonly caused heat generation without\ncardiac acceleration. And the\nmolecule can be taken as a pill (unlike\nadrenaline and its natural relatives).\nUnfortunately for the fatties,\nBeechams don't want to sell the drug\nor put it through full clinical trials.\nThey say the market is too small. This\nmight be true in worldwide terms, but\nthe British obesity market is huge (no\npun intended) and someone is sure to\ntake the sales job up.\nLeft-hands\ndie young\nAbout one in ten people are left-handed. This small percentage makes\nit easy for the rest of us to ignore\nthem. So left-handed implements are\nfew and far between and the poor\nsouthpaws are made to feel they are\nin a persecuted minority. They used\nto comfort themselves with the\nknowledge that at least God liked\nthem, but this had now been shown\nto be untrue: apparently he had made\nthem so that they die young.\nIt has been known for some time\nthat there appears to be a decrease in\nthe percentage of left-handers in older\npopulations. This might be explained\nby a previous generation of teachers\nwho forced young children to write\nwith their right hands, but left-handedness is impossible to\ncompletely eradicate. On the other\nhand there is some evidence that some\ndiseases are more likely to attack left-handers (allergies and immune system\nproblems are common).\nTo get some hard evidence on\nlongevity differences, Diane Halpern\nand Stanley Coren (California State\nUniversity and University of British\nColumbia) decided to look at The\nBaseball Encyclopaedia where dates\nof birth and death and throwing hand\nare all recorded. Their evidence\nconfirms that right-handers live\nlongest. Average life-expectancies are\nabout one year less for the poor\nsinistra ls( useless historical fact: our\nword sinister comes from the Latin\nfor left and reflects the medieval\nsuspicion of the unusual). The\ndifferences appear to be statistically\nsignificant by conventional tests.\nMortality rates appear to be the\nsame until about the age of 35. From\nthen on about two percent more left-handers bite the dust than right-handers each year.\nWhy should the poor sinistra ls suffer this (slightly) speedier fate? It\nmight be because they are genetically\ninferior to the rest of us. On the other\nhand (no pun intended) it is possible\nthat most of the difference is\naccounted for by the greater\nlikelihood of accidents in a world\ndesigned for right-handers. So the fact\nthat left-handed scissors are difficult\nto find in the shops may actually be\nkilling people. It's not that they are\ninferior, it's just that right-handers are\nin the majority.\nFriday May 27th1988 FELIX\nUNDER THE MICROSCOPE\nby Steve Black\n\n"

The\nPresident, eager to see if the story was\ntrue, looked up the telephone number,\nrang it and asked to speak to Mr Rose.\nWhen Alan finally came to the\n'phone, the President slammed it\ndown and was seen pacing around the\noffice for several minutes claiming\nthat he was going to kill the absent\nDP when he next saw him.

The next\nmorning he became distraught when\nhe thought that he had not only\nmislaid his keys but also his contact\nlenses. His anxious friend, concerned\nthat Mr Shanley would have to wear\nhis glasses (ugh!), rang around\nCollege to find out where the lenses\ncould be.\nThe lenses were eventually\nfound\u2014in Mr Shanley's eyes!\n\u2022 HOLBEIN HOUSE'S least\nfavourite heartthrob, Yishu Nanda,\nhas been living up to his reputation\nas 'Yishu the Octopus' again this\nweek.

The\nlecherous Mr Nanda was last seen\nchasing Ms Bains around the JCR\nthreatening to bare his hairy chest.\n\u2022QUOTE OF THE WEEK: comes\nfrom Alan Hepper, Guilds Hon Sec.\nOn witnessing an argument between\nlast year's FELIX Editor David Jones\nand reformed alcoholic Paul Shanley,\nMr Hepper remarked: 'It's a battle of\nthe the wit and the half-wit'.\nbia cK MAiL Information required on the following topics:\n\u2022 Why was last Thursday's AGM held in the Union Concert Hall\nwhere, if the meeting had been quo rate, fire regulations would have\nbeen broken?\n\u2022 ICU DP-elect Chas Brereton has moved into present DP Alan Rose's room in 96 Beit Hall following Mr Rose's departure. Mr Brereton is\npaying the full whack for his hall bill. However, the phone in the room\nis still fully operational. Who is footing the bill for all Mr Brereton's personal phone calls? On the subject, why has Mr Brereton moved\ninto the room, when Mr Rose is still the official occupant?\n\u2022 Neil McCluskey, our illustrious RCC Chairman, has given out details\nof where to contact ICU Deputy President Alan Rose should students\nneed him. It seems to me that other officers may be needed at all\nsorts of times.

ICU President\nSydney Harbour-Bridge bet College\nChief Security Officer Geoff Reeves\nan undisclosed amount. Mr HarbourBridge claimed that he could get his\nhand on an R37 within four days. For\nthe uninitiated, an R37 is a master key\nthat gains entry to most of the\nSherfield Building and Beit Hall.\nAfter three days with no success, Mr\nHarbour-Bridge got desperate. He\napproached an acquaintance of his and\nasked to borrow his R37. 'Of course,'\nsaid the acquaintance, 'what do you\nwant it for?'. 'Oh,' came the reply,\nT had a bet with Geoff Reeves'.\n'F* ck off,' said the acquaintance.\nThe following letter was received in\nthe FELIX Office this week:\nIt was sad to note that, on your\n'Blackmail' page in the last two issues\nof FELIX, some accusations of\nalleged activities of mine whilst at\nschool. I was, at first, confused as to\nwhere these allegations could have\noriginated. I then remembered, that\nin my second year at school, it was\nalleged by one of my classmates (to\nthe rest of my English class) that I had\ncut off a few pubic hairs privately\nduring a lesson. (A typical childish\njoke). I also remembered that Mr\nAndrew B Thompson, once of that\nclass but no friend of mind, is now\na first year Maths student and Bean's Club minion.\nI ask you to note that, following the\npublishing of the allegations, I have\nreceived a tasteless slur stuck upon\nmy pigeonhole in the Union Office.\nThese allegations, even if they did\noriginate with Mr Thompson, are\nwholly untrue, damaging, and\nliterally libellous. May I ask for you\nto publish a public apology to myself\nand a withdrawal of the above-mentioned allegations and suggest that\nyour informants/columnists make\nsome form of public donation to Rag\nas rec comp ense. Otherwise I feel that\nI may have to take legal advice on the\nmatter.\nI sincerely hope I do not have to\ntake the matter further, be it a formal\ncomplaint to ICU Publications Board\nor to a higher body.\nYours sincerely,\nNeil Motteram.\nWe are terribly sorry for having\nallegedly libelled you Neil, old boy.\nPlease take our unreserved apologies\nbut our alleged source claims that it's all allegedly true.

Residence Insurance\nFor those of you who are interested,\nmy analysis of the claims on this\npolicy for the last two years has\nthrown up some interesting figures.\n1 calculated the claims history for last\nyear (Aug '86 to July '87) to be \u00a315\n218 on a premium of \u00a320 169. This\ngave a claims ratio of 75%, which\nwas too far over the generally\nacceptable 60% to avoid a rise in the\npremium for this year to \u00a324 097, a rise of 19%. In order to compare this\nyear with last, I calculated the claims\nhistory for each year up to the end of\nthe spring term. For 86/87 this was\n\u00a311964 and for 87/88 it was \u00a3 7 8 9 2 ,\na difference of \u00a34072. The portion of\nthe claims history in 86/87 arising\nfrom key thefts in Linstead was\n\u00a33697. The close tally of these figures\nis quite remarkable. It seems to be\ndemonstrated that real improvements\nin security can have a real effect on\nthe premium.

    "content": "FELIX NEWS FEATURE\nWUS not WU SWhere did your quid go?\nImperial College Union is a member of the World University\nService (WUS), an educational charity which works for\neconomic and social justice in the Third World. Last term,\nICU decided to sponsor a Third World student on a course\nwhich would be appropriate to the developing needs of his/her\nnative country, following the initiative of last year's President\nChristine Taig. The money for that student's transport, living\ncosts, fees and residence was to be found by the Union and\nthe College.\nThe student arrived in this country\nnine years ago as part of the\nWesternisation Programme of the\nShah of Iran. Since the revolution in\nhis home country, he managed to\ncontinue his education by working\nillegally and gaining support from his\nparents in Teheran.\nHe was eventually thrown out of\nCollege accommodation because he\ncould not pay his hall bills and spent\nthree months living with Mr HarbourBridge in Linstead Hall.\nIn February, the Warden of\nMontpelier Hall and a close personal\nfriend, Kevin O 'Connor, managed to\npersuade a company to sponsor the\nstudent for a sum of \u00a37,000 to pursue\nOriginally College administration\nwere keen to establish a South African\nScholarship under the WUS scheme\nbut it was realised that it could not be\nup and running until the academic\nyear 1989/90. Union President\nSydney Harbour-Bridge (name\nchanged in aid of Comic Relief) was\nkeen to see some other student gain\nbenefit from the Scheme before he left\nCollege.\nThree stages had to be completed\nbefore the WUS Scholarship could\ncome into operation: a rent-free place\nin a hall of residence had to be\nnegotiated: some means of\nmaintenance had to be arranged; and\ntuition fees had to be paid for by some\nmeans or waived by College.\nThe first stage was relatively easy\nto accomplish. The Union agreed to\nguarantee one of the sixteen Union\nplaces in residence to the WUS\nstudent and Mr Harbour-Bridge got\nagreement at a Union General\nMeeting that the College Residence\nAccount should pay for the room. He\nexplained that just a pound on\neverybody's rent each year would\nenable a Third World student to come\nto Imperial.\nThe second stage has been more\ndifficult to achieve. Mr HarbourBridge proposed that ICU Charity\nRag should adopt the student as one\nof their supported charities each year.\nHe believed that this would be the best\nway to pay for such a student's living\ncosts. But nobody showed up to argue\nthe WUS case at this year's Rag\nAnnual General Meeting and the\ncharity wasn't adopted.\nThe third stage is entirely up to the\nCollege departments who have been\nasked to waive their fees.\nDespite the stage two hiccups,\neverything seemed to be going quite\nsmoothly. In February, the Student\nResidence Committee (SRC) agreed\nthat the Residence Account would pay\nfor a room in hall. It was decided that\na postgraduate student would live in\nMontpelier Hall and an undergraduate\nwould take the first year in a shared\n^ mu i if fW\" COnsort Road\nLondon S\\ V7 2BB Td: 0\nJ5 S951U Ex, 3\nT,iC Thc Mur.dir do b\"'I' SO 10 CO'.\nrT. ic- period of o', \u00ab\n' prc-wr.i tha,t here \u2022> \u00ab ' * Jime you ,\nsc'.oi ir?L.

It\nwas also agreed that it would be\neffective from the point when the\nUnion managed to support a student\nnominated by WUS. Each student\nwould have their case reassessed\nevery six months and be expected to\nbe of good academic standing at the\nend of each year.\nOne significant decision that was\nmade by the SRC was that they did\nnot specify that the sponsorship had\nto be for a South African. The reason\nstated to the WUS was that they did\nnot want to be tied down to South\nAfricans, who may not necessarily be\na needy group in the future. WUS\nagreed that the scholarship could\n'potentially be available for any WUS\nnominates'.\nIt was shortly after the SRC\nmeeting that Mr Harbour-Bridge\ndecided that the 'free' room he had\nsecured by U GM could be used this\nyear for 'a needy case'. He nominated\nan Iranian MPhil student in the Civil\nEngineering Department.\nfurther research on journey times in\nLondon. This money was deemed\nenough to pay his fees and left around\n\u00a31,500 for his living expenses.\nMr Harbour-Bridge persuaded both\nCollege and WUS that as students\nwere prepared to pay for a Third\nWorld student this year, they would\ncover the cost of this student's hall\nbills for the next year. He told\nmembers of the SRC that 'the WUS\nscheme would enable Mr X to\ncontinue his PhD until this time next\nyear by which time he will have lived\nin this country for ten years and be\nable to apply for residential status and\ngain a full work permit'.\nHowever, the Chairman of the SRC\nBrian Levitt was unhappy about the\nplan. In a letter to the President on\n2^nd February, he expressed his\nconcern about the turn of events: 'A more fundamental objection is that\nSRC agreed, with reluctance, to the\nWUS student sponsorship on the basis\nthat it would be used to bring a student from a Third World country\nto this College to be educated\u2014ie that\nthe scheme would benefit not merely\nthe student but the country concerned.\nI cannot feel that either SRC or the\nUnion Council would have agreed\nsimply to use the money and the place\nto help somebody already in College,\nor already having received\nconsiderable help from the College\nand about whom there must be some\ndoubt as to whether he will return to\nhis own country.'\nDespite Dr Levitt's objections, Mr\nHarbour-Bridge informed members\nof the SRC on 25th March that, as\nCollege Secretary and WUS had\nagreed to his plan, he had asked the\nAccommodation Office to give the\nstudent a place in Montpelier Hall.\nAt the beginning of this term,\nCollege residents were surprised to\nfind an extra pound added to their\ninsurance bill. A letter enclosed with\nthe bills explained that it was to pay\nfor a year in residence for a student.\nIt also gave everyone the opportunity\nto reclaim the pound from the Union\nOffice if they did not agree with the\nlevy.\nFELIX spoke to Dr Levitt\nyesterday. He said that he still had\nobjections to Mr Harbour-Bridge's methods but realise cT that the student\nwas indeed a needy case. He also\nemphasised that no student was\nobliged to pay the pound if they did\nnot want to.\nEditor-in-chief Judith Hackney\nBusiness Manager Chris Martin\nReviews Editors Andrew Clarke\nand Sumit Guha\nClubs Editor Andrew Waller\nSports Editors Dominic Strowbridge\nand 'Hector' Sullivan\nScience Editor Steve Black\nFeatures Editor Kamala Sen\nTypesetting Rose Atkins\nPrinting Dean Vaughan\nContributors: Pippa Salmon, Sunny Bains, Paul Shanley, Andrew\nClarke, Adrian Bourne, Delator, Chris Jones, Chas Jackson, Neil\nMcCluskey, Steve Black, Lloyd Ruddock, Al Birch, Noel Curry,\nKamala Sen, Chris Martin, David Jones, Yishu Nanda, Roy, Andrew\nWaller and all the colla tors.

    "content": "\u2022 , . \u2022 . . .\nvie M by\nAdrian\nBourne\nOo30 This weekend sees the start of the\nFormula One North American mini\nseries, probably the toughest month\nof the year, with three hard races and\nno return to base.\nSunday's Mexican Grand Prix is\nfollowed in two weeks time by the\nCanadian event with Detroit on June\n19th. The Circuito Hermanos\nRodreiguez, just outside Mexico City,\nis a2.7 mile medium speed circuit\nwith a twisty back section and a long\nstart/finish straight entered from a banked 180\u00b0 corner. The surface is\nnotoriously abrasive and mid-race\ntyre changes should be the order of\nthe day. Perhaps the most interesting\ntopic will be not who wins but what\nthe TV coverage is like. At Rio, the\ndirection was its usual appalling\nstandard, the technical quality bad and\nthe BBC only showed highlights.\nThings improved markedly for Imola\nwhere RAI provided excellent\npictures but the BBC goofed badly by\nshowing the race half an hour after\nit had finished (much to the\namusement of Radio 2). For Monaco,\nthe BBC decided to show the whole\nrace truly live but were let down by\nthe poor direction from the\nMonagasques. The situation this\nweekend is likely to be even worse.\nAs the football World Cup showed,\nthe Mexican TV service is not\ntechnically brilliant and the directors\nsimply do not have enough motor\nracing experience. An added\ndisadvantage this year is the loss of\nthe in-car cameras, mounted last year\non the Lotus of Satoru Nakajima and\nthe Brabham of Andrea de Cesaris.\nThe French manufacturers of the\ncameras, the Thomson electronics\ncompany, want their name displayed\non the screen when the camera is\nused, in much the same way that the\nFormula One timekeepers LonginesOlivetti get a credit for any timing\ninformation. However, the other\nsponsors won't allow this so Thomson\nhave withdrawn die* cameras.\nOnto the race itself. McLaren lost\nvaluable test mileage when they had\nto return straight home from Monaco\nto repair Ayrton Senna's badly\ndamaged car rather than heading for\nMonza like many other teams. Having\nalready destroyed one car this year,\nSenna is probably not the McLaren\nteam's favourite driver at the\nmoment. Ferrari enjoyed a bit of a revival at the Monte Carlo, finishing\nsecond and third, but this is not\nentirely unexpected given that their\nprivate test track, Fiorano, is similar\nin character to the principality's streets. Williams finally scored a1988 World Championship point when\nRiccardo Patrese finished sixth. The\ncontinued overheating problems of\nthe Judd engine are hardly likely to\nbe helped by the Mexican heat.\nPredictions: Senna to win, Thierry\nBoutsen (Benetton) top at mo. Meanwhile, in the States, the\nworld's biggest sporting event will be\ntaking place\u2014the Indianapolis 500\nmiles. Qualifying was dominated by\nthe three Penske PC 17 Chevrolets\nwho occupy the front row. Pole\nposition goes to Rick Mears with a four lap qualifying average of\n219mph! Lining up alongside him are\nteam mates and fellow former\nwinners Danny Sullivan and Al Unser\nSr. Fourth is my tip for victory,\nMario Andretti, the 1978 Formula\nOne World Champion, going for his\nsecond win at Indy. Other possible\nwinners include Al Unser Jr, Michael\nAndretti (son of Mario), Dutchman\nArie Luyendijk and Emerson\nFittipaldi, another former World\nChampion.\nElsewhere, at Dijon, France, Briton\nSteve Soper looks set to continue his\ndominance of the European Touring\nCar Championship in his Ford Sierra\nCosworth RS500, having won three\nof the four rounds already held.\nHighlights of the Mexican GP will\nbe on 'Grand Prix' on Sunday night\nwith Indy hopefully to be shown later.\nNext week: Silverstone F3000,\nBritish F3 and Touring Cars.\nLive on\nArrival\nFour of the most talented alternative\ncomedians come together late on\nSaturday evenings for the next two\nweeks. Steve Punt, Flip Webster,\nGuy Jackson and Hugh Dennis\nentertain with a mix of sketches,\nsatire, songs and sometimes painful\nobservations on society.

    "content": "MIL\nDeath\n(Cert PG)\nTo say that this comedy thriller is\ntypically formatted is something of an\nunderstatement. If you've seen Death\non the Nile, Evil Under the Sun or\nMuder on the Orient Express then you\ncould well claim to have seen this film\nalso.\nIn the usual style of Agatha Christie\nthere is a murder and too many\nsuspects to count on one hand.\nAmongst all this is Hercule Poirot\nspotting the clues and sifting through\nto identify the culprit. As you expect\nhe does this with all the pleas ance and\nhumour evident in his previous cases\nand the Belgian's portrayal by Peter\nUstinov is predictably good.\nThe supporting cast boasts no less\nthan seven other major stars, and with\nsuch strong competition, none of them\nhave a chance to steal the show, from\neach other or from Ustinov.\nParticularly good is Piper Laurie\n(Carrie, Children of a Lesser God) as\nthe wicked Mrs Emily Boynton, the\nobligatory murder victim. So\nconvincing is Laurie that I couldn't wait for her to die. Equally proficient\nis Sir John Gielgud, providing\nPoirot's necessary sidekick for the\ninvestigation, in the form of Colonel\nCarbury. Ustinov and Gielgud are\nfunny together, and undoubtedly the\nhighlight of the film.\nThe picture falls short of the mark\nin two respects. Firstly, the initial\nscene-setting is too vague and drawn\nout. producing a sense of boredom\nabout the whole thing. Then having\nreached the murder, collected the\nclues and rounded up the suspects for\nhis typically dramatic revelation at the\nend, Poirot lets us all down by giving\na poor motive for each of the\ninnocents and leaving the audience in\nno doubt as to the identity of the\nmurderess a good ten minutes too\nsoon. In short there is no tension in\nthe film, and that surely is the most\nimportant element in a thriller.\nWhat the film has going for it, aside\nfrom Gielgud, Laurie and Ustinov, is\nthe pleasant backdrop of 1937\nPalestine. The director Michael\nWinner (Death Wish, The Wicked\nLady) makes full use of the locations,\nfrom desert to cas bah to ocean liner,\nand had the characters been more\nconvincing I might have believed they\nwere really on holiday there.\nAppointment with Death is a pleasant film, quite entertaining if not\nexciting. It has the trademarks of the\nproduction-line company that Cannon\nhave become through churning out\npictures to fill its cinema screens, and\nas a result you'll probably prefer to\nread the book.\nAndrew Clarke.\nurn\nAll About Eve\nThis must have been the worst All\nAbout Eve gig I have ever been to.\nAfter losing my tickets, I finally got\nin due to the kind management,\nmissing the first five minutes. I don't think I missed much though. The slow\nones were okay, but it was the others\nthat missed. They didn't nudge\nbottoms as they usually do,\nparticularly In The Clouds and In the\nMeadow. Perhaps it was the venue,\n(filled with record company guests\netc, just sitting there, destroying the\natmosphere). Give me the Astoria or\nMarquee any day of the week.\nFields of the Nephilim\nTown & Country Club, May 18.\nThe Nephilim are a strange bunch:\nwith cowboy hats and dark glasses,\nthey appear to be very similar to The\nSisters of Mercy. Also, their vocalist,\nCarl, has the same growl and I could\nhear very few of the words sung\ntonight. However, the Nephilim also\nplay hard and fast, with their set\ncontaining many new songs,\nincluding their new single Moonchild.\nIt was when their older songs\nemerged that the air was filled with\n'snake y' arm movements and people\nsitting and standing on other people's shoulders.\nIt was absolutely brilliant.\nMac.\nFELIX Friday May 27th19887 "
