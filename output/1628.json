You spend ages\nwaiting for a blood-spattered neo-Western\nfilm, and then three\ncome along at once. In the past\nfew months Quentin Tarantino\nmade a welcome return with his\npotboiler gore-fest The Hateful\nEight, Leonardo DiCaprio dragged\nhimself through miles of wilderness\nin The Revenant, and now we have\nBone Tomahawk, a horrific traipse\nthrough cannibal-infested deserts,\ndirected by screenwriter and author\nS. Craig Zahler. Midway between\nthem, Bone Tomahawk manages to\nbe more inventive and memorable\nthan either.\nThe story is one of a classic\nWestern: a small town is terrorised\nby a group of Native American\n\u2018savages\u2019, who disembowel\nfarmhands and steal away town\ndoctor, Samantha O\u2019Dwyer. The\nsheriff teams up with Mr O\u2019Dwyer,\nbackup deputy Chicory, and\nlocal womanizer John Brooder,\nembarking on a journey to kill the\nIndian tribe and rescue the captives.\nThe main bulk of the story happens\nwithin the first half hour,leaving the\nremainder to languidly unspool, as\nthe motley crew face down raiders,\ngangrene, and cannibals.\nKurt Russell is on excellent form\nas Sheriff Hunt; he could have\nwandered off from the set of The\nHateful Eight, beard intact. As the\nbumbling old widower Chicory,\nRichard Jenkins is endearing, and\nsimilarly Matthew Fox inhabits the\nworld-weary character of Brooder\nwell, giving him a wit that \u2013 while\nnot razor sharp \u2013 is still the most\ncutting that side of the Mojave.\nHowever, the real draw here isn\u2019t\nreally the acting; it\u2019s the script.\nZahler made his name as a novelist,\nand his talent with both description\nand dialogue is obvious here. The\ndramatic opening perfectly builds a\ntension that remains a background\nhum throughout; there is no\nclimactic battle, no dramatic scenes,\nbut just four men making their\nway agonizingly slowly through\nthe desert. The writing is extremely\nwitty too, the drama punctuated\nby lengthy sojourns about the best\nway to read a book in the bath.\nWhile there is not much dialogue,\nZahler makes sure each line shines,\nstripping it of extraneous bloat,\nuntil he is left with a sharp bone of\nspeech, gleaming in the desert sun.\nOf course, the idea of a group\nof white men facing off against\nNative American \u2018savages\u2019has a long\nhistory in the Western genre; that\nthe dehumanising image was used\nto justify colonial atrocities should\ninspire more than a twinge of guilt\nin the viewer. However, the way\nZahler writes the antagonists means\nthey don\u2019t resemble any form of\nhumanity, let alone a real American\ntribe. Early on in the film the men\nask for the assistance of a Native\nAmerican tribal expert: \u2018They\u2019re\nnot my own kind,\u2019 he says, \u2018Men\nlike you wouldn\u2019t distinguish them\nfrom Indians, even though they are\nsomething else entirely\u2019.\nAnd he\u2019s right. The tribe have no\nlanguage, communicating through a\nseries of mystical howls; they cripple\nand blind the women members of\nKurt Russell, stealing scenes as the town sheriff, in the bloody, brutal Bone Tomahawk. Photo Credit: Shutterstock\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nThe script\nis stripped\nof bloat,\nleaving\nsharp bones\nof speech\nThe good, the bad, and the cannibalistic\nBridging the gap between modern Westerns, Bone Tomahawk shines through\nthe group to keep them docile and\nin the most memorable scene of\nthe film \u2013 which I won\u2019t spoil here\n\u2013 they graphically mutilate one of\nthe characters. In short, they are\nsub-human, filling the same role\nas zombies or vampires in other\nhorrors \u2013 a surface upon which\nhumanity can project their worst\nfears. I question whether such a\nportrayal is any more offensive than\nthose where Native Americans are\n\u2018peaceful mystics\u2019 or \u2018noble savages\u2019,\nexisting in a state of communication\nand harmony with nature, gifted\nwith a deep insight into the balance\nof the world. Such portrayals posit\nthe Native Americans as something\nto be \u2018understood\u2019 by the white\nsettler, who acts as a pupil for the\nIndians\u2019 teachings about the world.\nIt would not be remiss here to\nmention The Revenant, which\nportrays Native Americans as\nboth horrifically violent savages,\nand revered spiritualists, in touch\nwith the history of the earth. Bone\nTomahawk eschews this, and \u2013\nwhile certainly a gamble \u2013 is all the\nBone Tomahawk\nDir: S. Craig Zahler Script: S. Craig\nZahler. Starring: Kurt Russell,\nPatrick Wilson, Matthew Fox,\nRichard Jenkins. 132 minutes.\nstronger for it. It is also, perhaps, a\nstronger film than The Hateful Eight\n\u2013 certainly, it is less saturated with\nquick-fire dialogue. And while all\nthree films revel in their violence,\nBone Tomahawk is the one that\nstrikes the balance just right: in\nThe Revenant the brutality rung\nhollow, becoming meaningless; in\nThe Hateful Eight blood was strewn\nacross the set with such aplomb\nit brought down bathos on the\ndramatic proceedings; but in Bone\nTomahawk there is a sense of real\nviolence, not inflicted unwillingly,\nbut certainly not gratuitous.\nBone Tomahawk doesn\u2019t shy away\nfrom violence, but it never feels\nlike an ordeal, something to just\nget through in order to reach the\ntriumphant payoff at the end. In\nBone Tomahawk the biggest danger\nisn\u2019t the wilderness, or the savage\ntribes, but the men who inhabit it,\nand this is the film\u2019s biggest strength.\nAs Samantha O\u2019Dwyer says: \u2018This is\nwhat makes frontier life so difficult.\nNot because of the elements, or the\nIndians, but because of the idiots!\u2019\n\n"

I\nalso feel morally obliged because of\nEmmeline Pankhurst and shit.\nIf you can, you should probably\nthink about voting in the EU\nreferendum as well. There's a good\nchance you've dropped off the\nelectoral register, what with the\nTory rule change,discouraged by the\nElectoral Commission, that's meant\n770,000 names have been deleted.\nYours could be one of them! C'mon\nthey're reading of your texts, at least\nregister to vote. The solution to this\nproblem is inherently Googleable,\nand you just need a proof of address\nto make everything right again.\nIf you dodged voting last year\nbecause of your constituency was a\nFELIX, Beit Quad,\nPrince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nPrinted by Iliffee Print Cambridge,\nWinship Road, Cambridge\nRegistered Newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 FELIX 2016\nLetters\nMadam Editor,\nI was surprised to see that\nPresident Alice Gast has signed the\nround-robin letter (Sunday Times\n21/02/16) organised by the Britain\nStronger in Europe group, which\ncampaigns to keep the UK in a\nfundamentally unreformed EU at\nall costs.I hope Prof.Gast will make\nit clear that she supports the letter\nin a personal capacity and does\nnot speak on behalf of the entire\nuniversity, which of course contains\na much greater diversity of opinion\nthan this letter suggests.\nI found it very curious that Prof.\nGast believes that, \u201cin the EU\nthe UK is \u2026 a more attractive\ndestination for global talent\u201d. Surely\nto attract global talent we should\nadopt an immigration policy which\ntreats all nationalities on an equal\nfooting, rather than arbitrarily\nprivileging EU immigrants\nover those from other countries.\nAllowing free movement from the\nEU in a time where restriction of\nimmigration is government policy\nmakes it more difficult for talented,\nhigh calibre immigrants \u2013 such as\nPresident Gast herself \u2013 to join us.\nWhat about collaboration?\nNeither CERN nor the European\nSpace Agency, two of the world\u2019s\ngreatest scientific collaborations,\nare EU bodies. Participation in the\nERASMUS and Horizon 2020\nprogrammes is not restricted to\nEU member states, so UK students\nwould still have the opportunity\nto study abroad and academics\nwould still be able to collaborate on\ninternational research if we vote to\nleave the EU.\nImperial is especially well placed\nto thrive post-Brexit due to its\nstrong academic links with the East:\n\u201cImperial College London strives\nto be China\u2019s best academic partner\nin the West\u201d, as Prof. Gast recently\nsaid. Furthermore, many of the\nproblems that scientists are trying\nto solve, such as climate change, are\nglobal rather than regional in nature.\nThese problems require worldwide\nco-operation.\nFinally, on funding. We all know\nthat the UK is a large net contributor\nto the EU budget. In the event of a\nBrexit, the UK government could\nmatch or increase the funding that\nresearch organisations receive from\nthe EU. In any case, EU science\nfunding is miniscule: the European\nResearch Council plans to spend\n\u00a31.3bn across the entire EU in\n2016. The Department of Business,\nInnovation, and Skills will spend\n\u00a35.8bn on UK research in the same\ntime period.\nIn the 21st\ncentury, distance has\nnever mattered less. Thanks to the\nInternet, it is as easy to collaborate\nwith Auckland as with Aachen\nor Aberystwyth. We have always\nbeen an outward looking nation: In\norder to continue as a world leader,\nwe must raise our eyes from the\ncalcified trade bloc that is the EU\nand look to more distant horizons.\nThe world is calling to us. How will\nwe answer?\nJasper S. Menkus\nIt'll probably just go to\nvoicemail.\n-Ed. The EU referendum back in 1975 got a few Imperial students going then too.\nstronghold,votinginthereferendum\nis arguably the first time your vote\nwill matter as much as anyone else's.\nIf you have any opinion on Britain's\nplace in the world, trade blocs,\nhuman rights laws, or the ease with\nwhich British teens can interrail,\nyou should probably have a little\nthink about voting.\n\n"

He pointed out that\n\u201ceven when we look at nature, our\nimagination constructs the picture\u201d\nand true to this belief, Delacroix\nexpressed the emotions felt before\nnature through subjective use\nof colour and form. This offered\na precedent for a new type of\nlandscape painting taken up by the\nImpressionists, who expressed the\npersonal experience and sensations\nevoked in the artist by nature\nthrough their paintings.\nThe Death of Sardanapalus, the reduced 1846 version, by Delacroix Photo Credit: Philadelphia Museum of Art\nThis\nreaffirms\nhis role in\nmodern art\nIn Room three are Delacroix\u2019s\nsurprisingly bold flower paintings,\na relatively underrated part of his\noeuvre.

He painted flowers as a way\nto show mastery of colour, and they\nwere some of the earliest examples\nof the revolutionary movement \u201cart\nfor art\u2019s sake\u201d; painting for sake of\npainting, for aesthetic joy of artist\nand audience.\nOver all in Delacroix\u2019s works\nin this exhibition, including ones\ninfluenced by mythology and\norientalism, his color scheme is\nvery similar to that of the avant-garde works. His omnipresent and\npersistent palette of bright bold navy,\nred, yellow, and black immediately\nbrings to mind the palette of\nMalevich\u2019s Suprematism paintings.\nDelacroix himself said, \u201cI dislike\nreasonable painting\u201d \u2013 a statement\nresonant of an abstractionist\u2019s\nmotto, isn\u2019t it?\nThe last room seems to reaffirm\nDelacroix\u2019s central role in\ndevelopment of modern art. There\nis just one small painting by him in\nthis room,alongside several works by\nMatisse and a work by Kandinsky \u2013\nboth prominent figures of the early\n20th\ncentury modern art world. This\nroom implies Delacroix\u2019s lasting\nlegacy, and it\u2019s a shame that it ends\nso early in the art history timeline!\nIt would be even more curious to\nsee Delacroix\u2019s influences on later\nmodern artists such as Picasso.\nThe show\u2019s punchline is FantinLatour\u2019s Immortality, where\na winged figure representing\nimmortality showers roses towards\nthe greenery of a park above\nwhich the name \u201cDelacroix\u201d faintly\nhovers. This is almost too blunt an\nexpression of the show\u2019s theme of\nDelacroix\u2019s enduring legacy when it\nhas already succeeded in subtly and\nartfully expressing its title in various\nways throughout each of the rooms.\nPerhaps it is not only the influence\nof his revolutionary use of colour\nand form to express feelings that\nlives on in modern art, but also\nthe central idea for painting that\nhe expressed in the last line of his\npersonal journal \u2013 \u201cThe first merit of\npainting is to be a feast for the eyes.\u201d\nDelacroix and the Rise of Modern\nArt is at the National Gallery,\nLondon until 22nd\nMay\nA trippy look at first-time parenthood\nI\nread Nina Segal\u2019s script for\nin \u201cIn the Night Time\u201d in a\nmad, streaming rush, coffee on\nfingertips on pages in the dregs\nof whisky and sleep.

His focus\nis on the minimalism of the staging\n\u2013 including the eerie neon glow\nof the \u2018precious child\u2019 (or a plastic\ndoll with broken legs). Chaos spills\nacross the stage in the wink of a dog\nand a lion with a thorn in it\u2019s paw.\nLike all good children\u2019s stories, the\ngrown-up jokes are in the sidelines,\nbut the play leaps for them.\nIt suffers only in that the pitch is\nhard to maintain. Once the tide\u2019s\nin and the big bad world has burst\nthrough the window how do you\nstop it pouring out? At points the\nplay verges on manic \u2013 and that\u2019s\nundoubtedly the point \u2013 but the\naudience is, maybe, drowned just a\nhint too quickly to register the full\nforce of the flood.\nGate has pulled out the stops on\nthis \u2013 some of the most thought\nprovoking theatre I\u2019ve seen in a\nwhile. And c\u2019mon IC \u2013 it\u2019s on your\ndoorstep for \u00a37.50.

Anyone\nwho\u2019s seen Swept Away or The\nNext Best Thing should know that\nshe\u2019s never set the bar high for\nmusicians-turned-actors. For ease\nof list-making I\u2019ve excluded artists\nfrom the 50s and 60s because\nstarring in shitty films seemed to be\na requirement in those times (here\u2019s\nlooking at you Elvis):\nBeyonc\u00e9 Knowles\nLong before she was dominating\nthe Super Bowl half-time show\nand releasing music videos\nwhich warrant short-film status\nthemselves, Beyonc\u00e9 was a budding\nfilm star.

Bey\u2019s\nFord Prefect was easily the best\npart of this film, and the rapper has\nalso stolen scenes in many others,\nincluding The Italian Job remake.\nJustin Timberlake\nConsidering his superstar status,\nJustin Timberlake\u2019s movie career\nsuccess came as little surprise.\nTimberlake has now starred in\nseveral features from Rom-Coms\n(to be expected) to serious dramas.\nAdmittedly, one need only watch\nBlack Snake Moan to know he\u2019s\nno DeNiro, but the charisma that\nmade him so successful in music\nalso lends something special to his\nfilms. Special shout out to The Social\nNetwork.\nBEN COLLIER\nEquality at the Oscars?\nAhead of the Academy Awards this weekend, we ask whether or\nnot it\u2019s time to pull the plug on gender-segregated acting awards, in\nfavour of a gender-neutral accolade\nT\nhe year that saw the\nfirst Academy Awards,\n1929, also saw two\nlandmarks in the march\nfor equality: in the UK, the 1929\nelection was the first one in which\nwomen under 30 could vote, leading\nto it being termed the \u2018Flapper\nElection\u2019; and in Canada, five\nwomen led a campaign to change\nthe legislature to recognise women\nas \u2018persons\u2019, meaning they could\nstand for any role in government.\nIn the nine decades since, we have\nseen revolutionary strides in sexual\nequality, and yet Hollywood awards\nremain a region of segregation:\nwhen the Academy Awards are\nbroadcast, the acting categories will\nstill be split along gender lines, as\nthey have been since their inception.\nSo why is this? It could be argued\nthat early on in the days of the\nfilm industry, women were rarely\nafforded interesting parts, and that\nSteinem said: \u2018it\u2019s not like upper\nbody strength\u2019 \u2013 acting requires\nskill and hard work, and this is\nindependent of the individual\u2019s\ngender. To continue to portray\nwomen actors as \u2018separate but equal\u2019\nreally isn\u2019t true equality.\nFurthermore, having a single\nacting award could set a precedent\nfor the industry: where the\nAcademy goes, the industry follows,\nand by breaking down gender lines a\npowerful message could be sent out\nto studio heads.The gender pay-gap\nin Hollywood has \u2013 rightly \u2013 been in\nthe news in the last couple of years.\nFrom Frances McDormand talking\nabout how she has only been paid\nher going rate once in her career,\nto Jennifer Lawrence and Amy\nAdams being paid significantly\nless than their male co-stars in\nAmerican Hustle, gender equality is\nbecoming a driving force in shaping\nthe industry. Adopting a gender-the decision to separate out actors\nfor awards ensures that at least two\nwomen will win an Oscar every year.\nConversely, nowadays it is acting\nwhere men and women are most\nequal in the industry: last year only\n6 non-acting awards were given to\nwomen, out of 19; there has never\nbeen a woman nominated for Best\nCinematographer; and Kathryn\nBigelow remains the only woman\nto win the Best Director award.\nShould we have separate gender\ncategories for these awards too?\nWhile I do agree that there\nneeds to be a lot more done to\nencourage women across all areas in\nHollywood, I don\u2019t feel like having\nacting awards divided by gender is\nthe best way to recognise women\nactors working today; all it does is\nplace them in a category of their\nown, furthering the idea that their\nwork is inherently \u2018different\u2019 to the\n\u2018serious\u2019 work of men. As Gloria\nAs Patricia Arquette pointed out in her Oscar speech, Hollywood is a hostile place for women. Photo Credit: StudioCanal/Fox/John Shearer AP\nThe Smuggler\nDir: Angus Sampson, Tony\nMahony. Script: Angus Sampson,\nLeigh Whannell. Starring: Angus\nSampson, Hugo Weaving, Leigh\nWhannell. 103 minutes.\nM\naking a film about\nbowel movements is\na tough sell. But that\nhasn\u2019t stopped Tony\nMahony and Angus Simpson, the\ndirectorial duo behind Australian\ncrime drama The Smuggler, who\napproach the topic with great vision,\nbut a lack of even-handedness. Set\nagainst the backdrop of the 1983\nAmerica\u2019s Cup, which saw an\nAustralian yachting team breaking\nAmerican dominance of the race,\nThe Smuggler tells the tale of Ray\nJenkins (Tony Mahony), a young\nman from the back end of nowhere\nwho spends most of his time\nrepairing televisions, being looked\nafter by his mother, and playing\nfootball in his local amateur team.\nA trip to Thailand for the team is\nfunded by shadowy small-town\ncrime boss Pat (John Noble),\nand Ray is convinced to smuggle\nheroin back across the border in\nhis stomach, in order to help out\nAngus Simpson as Ray, in the somewhat confused film The Smuggler. Photo Credit: The Smuggler PR\nwith his parents\u2019 financial troubles.\nHowever, he is stopped at the last\nminute by customs, and detained\nin a hotel, where \u2013 rather than face\ncriminal charges \u2013 he opts to try\nand hold his bowels for the next ten\ndays, at the ire of police agent Croft\n(Hugo Weaving).\nOn the surface, this film all about\nshitting could easily turn out to be,\nwell\u2026shit. And the promotional\nmaterial doesn\u2019t help either \u2013\nshowing Mahony bending over, it\nseems to promise some kind of high-jinks caper centred around laxatives\nand defecation. But actually The\nSmuggler is more than that, with\na variety of different moods and\nthemes explored. At some points\nattempts at humour are made, but\non the whole this is an incredibly\nbleak film, more in keeping with\nsocial realist dramas than black\ncomedies. Ray seems a little simple,\nripe for exploitation, and protests\nas the pellets of heroin are forced\ndown his throat; he is regularly\nabused by the police chiefs in charge\nof him, who make him endure\nscalding showers; his dad, buckling\nunder pressure, starts drinking,\nand verbally abuses his wife before\nmeeting an untimely fate; his own\nmother tries to slip him laxatives in\norder to get him arrested. At times\nit\u2019s unclear whether I\u2019m watching a\nhumorous exploration of Australian\nmasculinity, or a Shane Meadows\nfilm.\nElsewhere, Mahony and Simpson\nseem to have taken a cue from\nDavid Lynch: one scene is eerily\nreminiscent of the famously\ndisturbing karaoke scene in Blue\nVelvet, where Dean Stockwell sings\nalong to Roy Orbison \u2013 only this\ntime it\u2019s crime boss Pat crooning\nat the funeral of Ray\u2019s best friend,\nmurdered by the police; elsewhere,\nRay\u2019s inner turmoil (both mental\nand gastrointestinal) is represented\nby a series of malarial fever dreams,\nwhich drip with Lynchian sweat.\nScenes like this are excellent,\nbut the issue is that Mahony and\nSimpson don\u2019t seem to know what\nthey\u2019re making: is it a dark satire\non Australian competitiveness,\nwith the America\u2019s Cup serving\nas a metaphor for trying to keep\nup in a changing world? Or is it\na social drama, where young men\nfrom working class towns are kept\nstuck in a world of petty crime and\npolice brutality? Whatever it is, it\u2019s\ncertainly far from shit \u2013 with a bit\nmore of a unified vision, Mahony\nand Simpson could have had an\nexcellent film.Even though it doesn\u2019t\nreach those heights, The Smuggler is\nfar better than its scatilogical matter\nmay suggest.\nFRED FYLES\nneutral acting award could show the\nAcademy recognises \u2013 and values \u2013\nwomen\u2019s work the same as men\u2019s.\nAnd if an appeal to equality doesn\u2019t\nreach you, what about just a appeal\nto quality? Now, we know that, by\nand large, the Academy Awards are\nmeaningless. Meaningless both in\nthe \u2018what about Syria?\u2019 sense of the\nwider world, but also within film\nas an art form; brilliant films don\u2019t\nget awarded anything, and the vast\nnumber of bad films that get awards\n(1994: Forrest Gump, 2002: Chicago,\n2005: Crash) indicate that Academy\nAwards are not about artistic\nmerit. But this problem is more\npronounced in the acting category.\nLet\u2019s consider this year\u2019s nominees:\nLeonardo DiCaprio will probably\ntake home the Oscar for his\nportrayal of Hugh Glass, a role that\ndoes not reveal any ability to convey\ncomplex emotions or nuance;\ninstead, it\u2019s another example of\nhow voters love seeing actors suffer\non screen (Hollywood sure is a\nsadistic industry). But then perhaps\nhe deserves the award, since it\u2019s\ndefinitely an absolutely stinking\nyear: Eddie Redmayne layered on so\nmany simpering affectations as Lili\nElbe that I\u2019m not sure whether the\nportrayal is offensive to just the trans\ncommunity, or women in general;\nBryan Cranston similarly conjured\nup a number of tics in order to\nplay Dalton Trumbo, in a role that\ncould be best described as \u2018pained\u2019;\nand Matt Damon was amusing, but\nnot much else, in humdrum The\nMartian.\nBut if we turn to the Best\nActress nominees, it\u2019s a different\nstory. Jennifer Lawrence, easily\nthe worst of the bunch, still packs\nin more emotional range than\nDiCaprio. Saoirse Ronan is equally\ncaptivating in her role as Irish shopgirl Eilis, imbuing her with a deep\nvulnerability that hardens into an\ninner strength. Charlotte Rampling\ndelivers a performance that would\nbe award-worthy just for what she\nbrings to the ending alone: a shot\nthat will haunt your dreams and\nlinger in your mind. Brie Larson,\nthe likely winner, is a magician on\nscreen, as the traumatised abuse\nvictim of Room who must hold\nit together for her child. And, of\ncourse,Cate Blanchett is completely\nphenomenal as the complex,\ncontrolled Carol Aird, in Todd\nHaynes\u2019 sumptuous masterpiece\nCarol.\nIt seems unfair that, if Laron and\nDiCaprio win the awards, Ronan,\nBlanchet, Rampling, and Lawrence\nwill all leave empty-handed,\ndespite putting in barnstormers of\nperformances. By splitting the role\nalong gender lines, it increases the\nchance that any particular year will\nassemble a shortlist of bad apples,\nmeaning the meaning of winning\nis cheapened. Now, imagine if\ninstead, we had a group of 8 actors,\nof all genders, competing for a\nsingle award; that way we\u2019d be more\nassured that whoever won would\nrepresent the pinnacle of that year\u2019s\nacting.\nUltimately, the continued\nexistence of separate acting awards\nis a mystery for me. By continuing\nto split along gender lines, the\nAcademy sends out a message\nthat men and women are separate,\nwhile simultaneously lessening\nwhat winning an Oscar means. Not\nonly that, but abolishing gender\nlines would make the ceremony\nconsiderably shorter, and \u2013 as\nanyone who has stayed up to watch\nthe Oscars will tell you \u2013 that would\nbe like manna from heaven.\nFRED FYLES\nMeryl Streep, clutching her Oscar, and thinking of how she\u2019s so much better than you.

On the other hand, koala\nbears are specialists; they can only\neat eucalyptus leaves, live in trees,\nand need warm climates.\nThis simplified dichotomy is also\nmirrored in the scientific world.\nThere are highly specialised experts\n\u2013 for instance, those who research\nthings like vascular remodelling\nin systemic and pulmonary\nhypertension, and generalists\nlike the field naturalist who\nintegrates knowledge of botany,\necology, engineering, management,\nchemistry, etc. in systems research.\nRecently, with increasing access\nto higher education and the\nentrenchment of institutionalised\nlearning, specialised focuses in\nsciences have become increasingly\ncommonplace.

It may even introduce\nthe baby to the risks associated\nwith harmful bacteria such as the\ngroup B Streptococcus, causing\nfatal infections in the newborns.\nSuch risks would have otherwise\nbeen dodged.

An explanation proposed is\nthat this gender pay gap is due to\nthe way products are described by\nmen and women on the site. Men\ntend to use more flattering terms\nthan women. However, even when\nsentiment was controlled for, the\ngender gap was still apparant.\nMore interestingly,this gender gap\nwas larger for new items than used\nitems, with a 19% compared to 3%\npay gap respectively. One possible\nexplanation for this is that people\nsubconsciously trust the judgement\nof women to describe good quality\nover men.\nLukianova-Hieb et al. 2016 @\nNature Nanotechnology\nAuctioning with\na gender gap\nwho excelled physically, socially,\nartistically, and in numerous\nintellectual fields was revered as the\ngreat thinkers and thought to spawn\ninnovative creativity.\nThis transition from valuing the\njack-of-all-trades to the master-of-one marks a distinct cultural shift\nin science. On the one hand, with\nincreasing numbers of scientists,\nengineers, and researchers across\nthe board, it seems natural that\nwe would settle into specialised\nniches; if we are freed up from a\nmore surficial knowledge of many\nthings, we can delve very deeply\ninto a singular problem or topic \u2013\nwhich surely is beneficial. However,\nthe crux of that issue comes when\nit\u2019s time for researchers to resurface\nfrom that depth and share those\nfindings in such a way that the\nknowledge is beneficial for society\nat large, which is not always\ncommon. Another issue is that in\nlosing generalist perspectives, we\u2019re\nlosing cross-disciplinary ideas and\nholistic ways of thinking that are\nquite useful in problem-solving and\ninnovation.\nSo while we\u2019ve dove head first\nand perhaps unconsciously into\nspecialisation, maybe it\u2019s best for\nthe scientific world to take cues\nfrom the natural world and retain\na mixed balance of specialists and\ngeneralists, so that we can benefit\nfrom these two very different, yet\nequally valuable mindsets and ways\nof undertaking scientific research.\nNAOMI STEWART\nS\ncientists are sent back to the\ndrawing board as researchers\nsuggest \u201chobbit\u201d skull\nprobably doesn\u2019t belong to\nan ancient human.\nThe perpetual mystery of human\nevolution has just lost a potential\ngrandfather of modern humans.\nIn 2003 the remains of a new\nprimate species, Homo Floresiensis,\nwas discovered in a cave on the\nIndonesian island of Flores and\nwere thought potentially to be a\nversion of modern humans. It\u2019s easy\nto see how their colloquial name\nof \u2018the hobbits\u2019 stuck; the average\nindividual was estimated to be\nthree foot tall and weighing 25kg,\nmeaning they would be by far the\nsmallest species closely related to\nhumans. Initially, the specimen was\ngenerally accepted to be a form\nof early human that lived 15,000\nyears ago. This theory suggests the\nreason for the shrunken stature\nand grapefruit sized brain was due\nsimply to a genetic defect that spread\nwithin this isolated population. An\nalternative theory was the specimen\nwas an ancestor of Homo erectus that\nhad undergone insular dwarfism\ndue to a shortage in the food supply,\nobtaining their hobbit like structure.\nHowever, recent research strongly\nindicates that the hobbit species\nHomo floresiensis may not be part of\nHomo at all.\nIt may seem news of little\nconsequence but the findings have\nignited a controversial debate about\nthese specimens, since previous\ninconclusive research has suggested\nmultiple explanations for these pint\nsize primates. A study published\nin the Journal of Human Evolution\ndocuments results from state of the\nart analysis of a layer of the most\nintact of the nine skulls excavated\nover the last ten years. The results\nfrom the analysis, such as skull bone\nthickness indicated that the skulls\nshowed \u201cno characteristics from\nour species\u201d. Even with extensive\nspecialisation, it is expected that\nthere would be some common\nfeatures between modern humans\nand the remains if indeed they were\npart of the Homo line. Additionally,\nanalysis of the skull showed no signs\nof significant genetic diseases that\nwould have to have been present\nfor the data to support the original\ntheory.\nThis opens up the mystery species\nto a multitude of questions about\ntheir origin and their relation to\nother primate species, including\nour own. Despite the wealth of\ninformation gained by the analysis,\nthe researchers remain unable to\nidentify what the species is likely to\nbe. Lead author, Antoine Balzeau\nsaid, \u201cSo far, we have been basing\nour conclusions on images where\nyou don\u2019t really see very much.There\nis a lot of information contained in\nbone layers of the skull\u201d.\nEven though the analysis provides\nstrong evidence that the species\nisn\u2019t ancestral to Homo sapiens, the\nstudy failed to rule out the second\nhypothesis. Therefore, it remains\npossible that the hobbits were a\nsubset of the ancestral group to\nHomo erectus that became smaller\nover time due to lack of key\ndietary requirements like iodine.\nHowever, it is also possible that\nthe remains represent the existence\nof a whole separate species, which\nwould open up a whole other can\nof worms for scientists trying to\nuntangle homo sapiens increasingly\ncomplex phylogeny. Balzeau simply\nconcluded: \u201cFor the moment, we\ncan\u2019t say one way or the other\u201d.\nRemains\nrepresent\nthe\nexistence\nof a new\nspecies\nOur science and engineering mix is wrong \u2013 there\u2019s too much specialisation and\nnot enough generalists.

Only last week, 250 people\nwere trapped in their hometown\nin Idaho, USA, as a result of a\nmassive landslide blocking the\nhighway connecting them to the\nrest of the world. This week, one\nman died and another two were\ninjured during a minor landslide\nin Ara Damansara, Malaysia, and\nfive villages were covered in dust\nand debris threatening residents\nwith suffocation, as a result of a\ndry landslide at Myagdi, a popular\ntourist destination in Nepal.\nHowever, landslides are not a\nphenomenon limited to terrestrial\nenvironments. They are known to\noccur underwater as well and may\nhave devastating consequences.\nAround 8200 years ago, such a\nlandslide occurred somewhere\nbetween the North Atlantic and\nthe Arctic Ocean, off the coast of\nNorway. Sediment that had been\ncollecting for thousands of years at\nthe edge of the continental shelf\nstarted sliding down the Norwegian\nsea resulting in area of sediment the\nsize of Maine travelling at speeds of\nover 40 miles per hour.\nThis massive relocation of land\nalso moved tonnes upon tonnes of\nseawater, sending tsunamis crashing\nover northern European shores\nsubmerging areas as far as 20 metres\nunderwater.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even comprehend the\nsize of a landslide like this,\u201d says\ngeologist PeterTalling of the United\nKingdom\u2019s National Oceanography\nCentre.\n\u201cA single landslide can move more\nsediment than all the world\u2019s rivers\nmove in a year.\u201d\nAlthoughunderwaterlandslidesof\nthis magnitude are not as common,\nsmaller landslides do occur more\nfrequently than you might expect.\nMany are known to have taken\nplace only in the last few centuries,\noften causing small tsunamis, with\nrecent research suggesting the 2011\nTsunami that struck Tohoku, Japan,\nwas only as devastating as it was due\nto an underwater landslide triggered\nby the earthquake.\nIn the past, the only evidence of\nthese immense geological events\nwas scarring of the seafloor, which\ncould only be recognised through\ncomparison of different seafloor\nmapping attempts. A series of\nunderwater landslides that occurred\nat Prince William Sound in the\nGulf of Alaska in 1964 were only\nidentified 60 years later, after a new\nmapping expedition compared its\nresults with the previous map which\nhad been generated 16 years prior to\nthe landslides.\nNow through the employment of\nadvancements in sonar technology\nwe are able to get a more detailed\nglimpse into the history of such\nphenomena. Multibeam sonar, for\nexample, provides a detailed model\nof the seabed surface,while sparkers,\nelectrodes emitting high-frequency\nacoustic pulses can penetrate\nmultiple sedimentary layers. Such\ndata can provide information on the\nsize, shape and path of landslides.\nYet, even though we now know\nmore about these phenomena than\nwe did before, predicting when the\nnext underwater landslide might\nstrike remains a challenge.\n\u201cRight now, to answer that\nquestion, one of the best things we\ncan do is keep looking for evidence\nof past landslides in places that we\nknow have had big tsunamis\u2019\u2019 says\nLesli Wood from the Colorado\nSchool of Mines.\nIndeed, with such range of size,\nimpact and conditions surrounding\nthese events, it is hard to formulate\nrules to predict when, where and\nhow powerfully the next one might\nbe. Topography, water quality and\nsediment composition all affect\nhow the seabed might react, so\ndetailed analyses of seafloor samples\nfrom earthquake ridden areas can\nprovide crucial data that can help\nbuild predictive models.\nTopromoteresearch,collaboration\nand awareness, Wood created an\nopen source database describing\nover 300 landslides based on their\nshape and size. She hopes that\nsoon the database will be enriched\nwith much needed geological data\nthat will enable risk assessment of\nprecarious areas, providing crucial\ninformation to the engineering\ncommunity.\n\n"

Sat slightly\nangled towards each other and\nseparated by an unassuming coffee\ntable were two of the greatest\nliterary figures of our time. I was\nseated right at the back (everything\nelse was sold out), and their figures\nwere dwarfed by the massive screen\nbehind them with their names\nemblazoned across. Kazuo Ishiguro\nand David Mitchell may be the only\ntwo people on a vast stage regularly\nused for entire orchestras or dance\ntroupes, but their presence filled the\nspace around them and commanded\nthe attention of rows upon rows of\nfans, writers, geeks and the curious.\nClearly, their words have touched\nthe lives of many.Being a passionate\nfan of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s books, I\nhad eagerly signed up for the event\nentirely because of him without\nactually realizing who David\nMitchell was. I mean, I\u2019ve watched\nCloud Atlas,but I am ashamed to say\nthat I have never actually read any\nof his books. On the other hand, I\ncount Ishiguro\u2019s Booker prize-winning novel Remains of the Day as\none of the books that have changed\nmy worldview, and his short story\ncollection Nocturnes completely\noverturned my ideas of the magic\nthat can be done with beautiful\nlanguage.\nHowever, this event turned out\nto be exceedingly fruitful precisely\nbecause of the dialogue between\nthe two arguably similar but\nultimately very different writers.\nMitchell describes his first book\npromotion event abroad where he\nwas pleasantly surprised to find\nan impressive crowd, only to learn\nthat they were all there for Ishiguro,\nwho was also at the event. He is\nfifteen years younger than Ishiguro,\nbut the two are good friends, often\nsending each other manuscripts\nfor comments and exchanging\nideas over the telephone. At one\npoint, Mitchell talks about how the\nmultiplayer board game Dungeons\nand Dragons inspired him as a child\n\u2013 to which Ishiguro replied that he\nhad mentioned the game to him\nbefore, but he had no idea what it\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Editor\nwas because he was probably too\nold!\nFriendly banter permeated much\nof their conversation,which was split\ninto three sections, each preceded\nby a clip. Since the event was titled\n\u201cAmong Giants and Ghosts\u201d, it was\nonly appropriate that the first clips\nwere from the films Sixth Sense and\nThe Innocent. Interestingly, they\ndisagreed fundamentally on what\nthey found scary about ghosts \u2013\nMitchell narrated a story his brother\ntold him as a kid, about a misplaced\nliver and his grandfather\u2019s ghost.\nIshiguro, however, contended that\nthat was more horror, which he\nthought was distinct from eerie,\nfear-inducing beings and events.\nHorror didn\u2019t scare him \u2013 what he\nfound scary was simply the existence\nof the supernatural, a being at the\nedge of reality.\nTo Ishiguro, ghosts show that\n\u201cour control over the world is\nnot complete\u201d, and that was\nwhat scared him. Writing, then\n\u201cunleashes this force or power\u201d.\n\u201cDo you write because you want to\ncreate something out of nothing,\nthen?\u201d Mitchell asks. Ishiguro\u2019s\nstories often deal with characters\nthat are struggling with ghosts\nwithin themselves, or the ghosts\nof decisions that they have made.\nLiving in Lord Darlington\u2019s estate\nlong after its days of glory, Stevens\nfrom Remains is constantly haunted\nby the mistakes of his past.\nThe second clip was from a samurai\ncomedy film, where two samurai\nstare at each other, tension building\nup palpably without any movement\nat all,until both of them slash across\nat the same time.Ishiguro points out\nthat Mitchell is far more acquainted\nwith writing action scenes than he\nis, and the pair went on to discuss\nthe value of writing about action,\nconsidering that films can do a far\nmore vivid job. Mitchell points out\nthat it is the build-up to the fight\nthat makes or breaks the game in\nwriting action, not the exchange of\nblows itself. Raising the example of\nWar and Peace, Ishiguro adds that\nwriting also allows one to move\nmore effectively between the micro\nand macro aspects of the action.\nAt one point, Ishiguro brought up\nthat he found Mitchell \u201cremarkably\nfearless as a writer, perhaps even\nreckless\u201d.\nDavid Mitchell and Kazuo Ishiguro, giants of the literary world. Photo Credit: Paul Stuart (left), Jeff Cottenden (right).\nClearly, their\nwords have\ntouched\nthe lives of\nmany\nIshiguro\u2019s\ncharacters\noften\nstruggle\nwith ghosts\nwithin\nthemselves\nDespite keeping a notebook of\nideas, Ishiguro said that most of\nthem didn\u2019t end up anywhere as\nhe found it greatly uncomfortable\nto write outside of his personal\nexperience, almost like he did not\nhave a right to.\n\u201cDo you hesitate in the same way?\u201d\nhe asked Mitchell, who replied that\nhe had a point of writing books that\nare quite different from one another,\nand in that process he tends to\nveer into the unfamiliar. However,\nboth agreed that there are certain\ncultural and political areas that they\nfelt compelled to avoid, because\nthe right to write them \u201chad to be\nearned\u201d\u2013 such as African American\nliterature being so richly filled by\nnative writers.\nPerhaps this avoidance of real\nhistory stems from a fear of\nmisrepresenting the past and doing\ninjustice to real tragedy. I do not\npersonally see anything wrong with\nappropriating history in works of\nfiction, if a particular time or event\nsuits the creative plot one has in\nmind. No one bills novels as history\nbooks, and there is no obligation to\nbe accurate, after all.\nIt was a great pleasure listening\nto two great writers chat, on this\nwhirlwind tour across a range\nof issues. I will never cease to be\namazed by the capacity of human\nimagination that creates words and\nimages so elaborate and beautiful\nthat speaks to so many people at\nonce.\u201cAmong Giants and Ghosts\u201dis\nan appropriate title not only because\nof the discussion of ghosts and\nfantasy, but because these are two\ngiants of contemporary literature.\n\n"

Photo Credit: Wikipedia\nL\nove him, hate him, agree\nor disagree with him, it\nis undeniable that US\nsupreme Court Justice\nAntonin Scalia was one of the most\ndivisive and outspoken American\npolitical figures of this generation.A\ngifted jurist and bastion of American\nconservatism, his aggressive style of\nquestioning and acerbic put-downs\nof opposing opinion made him\nrespectively loved and reviled by\nRepublicans and Democrats of all\nstripes. His passing, while away at a\nluxury ranch in Texas, in many ways\nmarks the end of a political era.\nIt also marks the beginning of a\ndesperatefightbetweenRepublicans\nand Democrats to secure control\nof his empty seat on the supreme\nCourt. The Court itself is the\nhighest level of judicial authority\nin America, consisting of nine\nmembers. Since Ronald Reagan\nappointed Scalia in 1986, there\nhas been a modest majority of five\nassociate Justices widely viewed as\n\u2018conservative\u2019. With Scalia\u2019s passing,\nthe partisan split between this\n\u2018conservative wing\u2019 and its liberal\nopposite number is even, meaning\nthat whoever can secure the ninth\nseat left by the late Antonin Scalia\nwill have a court favourably inclined\ntowards their policies.\nIn this regard, President Obama\nPresident\nObama is\nat complete\nliberty to\nchoose\nwhomever\nwe wishes\nand his Democratic Party have an\nadvantage.The process of appointing\na justice to the supreme Court itself\nis governed by the US Constitution,\nwhich reads: \u201c He [The President]\nshall nominate, and by and with the\nAdvice and Consent of the Senate,\nshall appoint ... Judges of the\nsupreme Court\u201d. The constitution\nis clear: the Senate (currently held\nby the opposing Republican Party)\nmay sign off on a candidate put\nforward by the President. However,\nthey cannot put forward a candidate\nof their own.\nThis brings us to our current\nquandry: President Obama is\nat complete liberty to choose\nwhomever we wishes to sit on\nthe court, provided the GOP\n(Republican) controlled senate\napproves. However, in the wake of\nScalia\u2019s passing, Senate majority\nleader Mitch McConnell has vowed\nto prohibit any appointments made\nbefore the next President assumes\noffice in January 2017, eleven\nmonths from now.\nMcConnell\u2019s supremely\nirresponsible stance on Obama\u2019s\nsupreme Court nomination will\nleave the Court without a ninth\nsitting Justice for almost an entire\nyear, severely weakening it\u2019s ability\nto set a binding precedent on a\nnumber of important upcoming\ncases. His argument that, because\n2016 is an election year, nomination\nshould wait until the next President\nassumes office, is little more than\nsophistry: no fewer than five other\nnominations to the supreme Court\nhave been made in election years.\nUnder this light, McConnell\u2019s call\nfor a delay is,in equal measures,both\nintellectually dishonest and crassly\npartisan, a thinly-veiled gamble\nin the hope that the next sitting\nPresident will be a Republican. It\nis also the potential first step on\na slippery slope: if the Senatorial\nmajority can hold off on confirming\na nominee for eleven months in\norder for the current President\u2019s\nterm to end, then why not one-and-a-half, or two years, or longer still?\nPolitically however, there are few\noptions available to the Republican\nParty: with the passing of Scalia,\nthere is now an even ideological\nsplit between the remaining eight\nsitting justices. Because supreme\nCourt appointments are made for\nlife, any appointment made under\nObama would tip this balance away\nfrom the GOP, possibly for many\ndecades to come. Given that the\nsupreme Court is a useful cudgel for\nboth parties to beat down unwanted\nlegislation (the GOP has used the\nfavourable 5-4 split afforded by\nScalia to bring challenges to both\nObamacare and the DREAM\nAct), and a means to hedge against\nchallenges to new laws passed by the\nGOP held Congress,it should come\nas no surprise that maintaining a\nconservative majority in the Court\nis seen as an absolute necessity for\nMcConnel and Co.\nThere is also a Presidential\nelection to consider. Had Scalia\npassed away closer to the January\n20th\ninauguration date,it would have\nbeen no difficult task to have simply\ndelayed a vote on the Supreme\nCourt nominee until after the new\nPresident was sworn in, after which\nthe previous candidate could be\nsilently replaced. However, delaying\nthe vote until Obama leaves office\nmeans that the whole ordeal will\nbe dragged out for eleven more\nagonizing months. McConnell\nand his Senate will also need\nto provide a strong justification\nfor denying any nominee a vote:\ndelaying the appointment of\nan otherwise qualified jurist on\nideological grounds will be seen by\nthe electorate as a nakedly partisan\nattempt to misappropriate one of\nAmerica\u2019s three legislative bodies.\nIt is therefore likely that President\nObama will elect a well-regarded\nmoderate (his current top choice,\nSri Srinivasan, was elected to the\nDC circuit court unanimously by\nthe Senate) and force the Senate\nRepublicans run in circles as they try\nto justify their stance. Should they\nbe unable to justify their blocking\nof an appointment, then they will\nsuffer for it come election time.\nThe remaining eleven months\nwill be an excruciating legislative\nbattle, for both Democrats and\nRepublicans. By pre-emptively\ncalling for a blockage of any supreme\nCourt nomination, McConnell et\nal have put their cards squarely on\nthe table: even if they do eventually\nallow a Senate vote on a nomination,\nit should be absolutely clear to all\nthat it is nothing more than party-political pretence. If he was still\nalive, Antonin Scalia \u2013 a vigorous\ndefender of Constituational\noriginalism \u2013 would surely have\nsome scathing rhetoric of his own\nfor Mitch and Co.\nOn second thought though,\nperhaps he wouldn\u2019t...\n\n"

The lyrics\nthemselves are also a standout point\nwith them being written in a second\nlanguage, a kind of warped and\ntwisted English. This gives rise to\nodd and quirky lyrics, adding to the\nwhole craze of the songs.\nThe opening track, \u2018Garden\u2019, is\nslowly before building to a crescendo\nof jangly guitars and vocal outbursts\nby Ana and Carlotta, by which time\nyou can\u2019t help feel pumped up and\npassionate towards their cause.\nWhat follows is the craziest\nsong on the album, \u2018Castigadas en\nel Granero\u2019 (roughly translated to\n\u2018Grounded in the Barn\u2019). A blend of\nmad lyrics are present (\u201call I see is a\nbig cow / and now I\u2019m eating all your\ncorn)\u201dbut are hardly recognisable in\nthe frenzy which ensues. It feels like\nyou should be dancing around like\nnobody\u2019s watching by the end of it,\nand this is neatly followed by \u2018Solar\nGap\u2019, a twinkly guitar instrumental\nechoing the hazy end to a party.\nThis soothing mood leads back\ninto the second half of the album,\nwith themes staying around the\ntrials and tribulations of young love.\n\u201cI am flirting with this guy, just to\npretend I\u2019m fine\u201d gives off a vibe of\npassive aggressive backstabbing at a\nformer flame, akin to staring across\na room and toying with them.\n\u2018Bamboo\u2019, along with \u2018Castigadas\nen el Granero\u2019, is a throwback to the\nband\u2019s first released material and yet\nagain captures a snappy outburst of\nlove, swiftly followed by the slowed\ndown and beautiful \u2018And I Will\nSend Your Flowers Back\u2019. Taking\nit down a notch gives a feeling\nsimilar to a long summer night,\ntwinged with the sadness of letting\ngo. \u201cSpace, what a fucked up mess\u201d\nis the motto which runs throughout\nand the style which Hinds seem\nto run with, that of peaking with\na passionate, heartfelt message is\nagain present.\nThe final two tracks on the album,\n\u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Man\u201d and \u201cWalking\nHome\u201d, are reconciliatory tunes,\nwith the former fitting in the same\ncalming vibe as \u2018And I Will Send\nYour Flowers Back\u2019, leading nicely\ninto the closing track which returns\nto the upbeat roots that opened the\nalbum up.\nThe crazed lyrics also are present\nagain, \u201cYou\u2019re the rice of my bowl\u201d\nbeing a particular favourite outburst\n(and also a rejected Valentine\u2019s Day\ncard slogan).

When\nthey did however, they played\nwith a youthful exuberance that\nthe recorded version just couldn\u2019t\ncapture.\nThe songs were bolstered by\nthe atmosphere and vice versa,\ngenerating a performance which\nwhile not the most technically\naccurate was bursting with fun. The\ncrowdjoinedinwiththeoutpourings\nof love,lust and longing,and danced\nalong in the spirit of it all.Rounding\noff this carefree, adolescent mood\nwas an encore in which the girls\ninvited their friends onto the stage,\nto dance around to a cover of \u2018Davy\nCrockett\u2019 like one big party.\nAll in all the polished sound of the\nalbum dampens the rawness of the\ngroup, a key factor in what stands\nthem apart from the rest of the\ncrowd. They\u2019re not manufactured\npop clich\u00e9s,they\u2019ve bottled an actual\nfeeling, a whirlwind summer filled\nwith all the emotions that young\nlove provides. It\u2019s hard to capture an\ninstant but in this case Hinds have\nmade huge strides towards it; it\u2019s\nnot perfect but it now remains to be\nseen whether they can do it again\neven better.\nLeave Hinds alone!

Both\nfollow similar themes, of jealousy\nand breakups, as well as starting off\nThe raw\nemotion\nshines\nthrough\nthe closing moments of a sunset and\na fleeting summer romance.\nBut where these songs are a decent\nlisten on a tube ride, they take on\na whole new life when played live.\nThey\nplayed\nwith a\nyouthful\nexuberance\nO\nver the past decade,\nLondon has lost over\nforty percent of its\nsmall music venues,\nand it is a similar story around the\ncountry. Notorious venues such\nas the Sheffield Boardwalk have\nalready closed, which saw greats\nsuch as The Clash, Sex Pistols,\nand Arctic Monkeys play there at\nthe beginning of their respective\ncareers. Many more small venues\nare at a risk of shutting down, like\nthe 100 Club on Oxford Street and\nthe Troubadour on Old Brompton\nRoad, which has gone up for sale.\nThe alarming rate of these closures\nis down to a combination of reasons:\nincreasing rent prices, ridiculously\nharsh licensing scrutiny, and the\npressure of building more housing\nleading property developers to raise\nblocks of flats next to these clubs.\nThis will inevitably cause more\nnoise-abatement notices to be filed\ncosting the venues thousands of\npounds to contest.\nTo preserve the cultural value\nthat these institutions bring to the\nBritish music scene,something must\nbe done. The UK music industry is\ncurrently valued at \u00a33.5 billion and\nis mainly based on the small venue\ngig here at Imperial. Without these\ngrassroots venues the British music\nindustry is simply not sustainable.\nIt is not only artists that need\nthese institutions to help their\ncareers. Small music venues provide\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for\nbar staff and technicians amongst\nothers.They, too, use these venues as\nopportunities to hone their talents\nand improve their career prospects.\nIn all professions you will have to\nstart at the bottom, no one starts\noff playing Wembley or being a\nlighting engineer at the O2.\nHowever, as much as it is about\nthe live music, it is also about the\nrole they play in the society. Small\nvenues have played host to activism\nand good for the surrounding\ncommunity. They have a heart,\na soul and a connection to their\ncommunity. These venues are a\nmeeting place for people with ideas,\ndiversity and a non-conformist\nattitude. It is imperative to hold\nonto passion, culture, art and fun\ntimes, to fight for what makes our\ncommunity ours. One of the many clubs at risk of shutting down.

The album\ninstead barrels along with funky\ninstrumentation and stringently\ncontrolled improvisation to provide\nmusic which is more at home in\na club than a jazz bar. Songs like\n\u2018Smarra\u2019 and \u2018Quiet Mind\u2019 have a\ndance music aesthetic similar to that\nadopted by Bonobo and other jazz-inspired producers. The group\u2019s use\nof acoustic instrumentation allows\nthem to create this music with a\nstrictly organic feel.\nThe most impressive aspect of\nMan Made Object is its ability to\nmaintain strong melodies with free\npercussion. This is best seen on the\nopening track \u2018All Res\u2019, where a\nhomely piano loop allows for some\nupbeat drum experimentation.\nThe album\u2019s subtle blending of\ngenres allows it to break free from\nits inspirations.

After a fantastic kick,\nthe defensive team were on. The\ndefense were extremely strong and\nwere able to stop the Killer Bees\nfrom advancing. After the fourth\ndown, the offensive team were on.\nWith a miraculous QB sneak,Kevin\nKim swerved and ran through the\ndefensive lines and, from our red-zone, scored an amazing touchdown\n(two point conversion successful).\nAfterwards,the defensive team were\nable to force a fourth down near\nour end-zone but, due to a fumble,\nBath were able to recover with a\nfew yards to spare from their first,\nmuch-needed, touchdown. With\nthat advantage, Bath were able to\nscore making it 6-8 as the two point\nconversion was unsuccessful.\nUnfortunately, afterwards, the\nImmortals defensive players picked\nup injuries and with a lack of\nplayers, many offensive members\nwere forced to play both ways. A big\nshout out to the offensive linemen\nwho stepped up in a time of need\nand filled in where necessary. With\nthe lack of players, special teams\nwere lacking organisation and many\nplayers had to step into fill the\ngaps before snaps. With a fatigued\nImmortals squad, Bath were able\nto take advantage and piled up\ntouchdowns. This unfortunately\nended with a score of 49-8; we wish\nthe Killer Bees a good and successful\ntrip up to Sterling and for the rest of\ntheir season.\nAfter the game, as is our tradition\nafter every last match of the season,\nthe Immortals formed a tunnel for\nthe leavers; I would like to dedicate\nthis section of our match report to\nthe leavers: Jonathon Robert Joseph,\nMarcus Stead-Hall, Bami Falana,\nEmanuel Oladayo Olagbaju, Rhys\nKilian, Noach Ben-Haim, Kevin\nKim, Paulius Viskis, Rayane M.\nJackson and Alex Brockhurst.\nJonathon Robert Joseph, played\nfor the Immortals and American\nfootball for the first time this year,\nplaying fullback. Jon has been an\nessential part to the team this year,\non and off the field, being loved by\nall.\nMarcus Stead-Hall, ex-publicity\nofficer and running back/full back\nhas been with the club for five years.\nThrough his days he\u2019s been known\nto specialise in cut blocks, with any\nlinebacker fearing to get on the field\nwhen seeing him. Bami Falana,\njoined the club last year and was\nalways playing running back until\nhis last game of this season where\nhe was playing as a linebacker and\na defensive lineman. His athleticism\nis known to all around; with his pace\nand strength he was a massive asset\nto the offense.\nEmanuel Olagbaju, current\nsecretary, has played for the club for\nfour years. Throughout his glorious\ncareer he played as a running back,\nslot, and a defensive lineman, his\npower and agility is famous within\nthe team and the American football\ncommunity in the country, his\ntrucking count is off the charts,\nand any defensive player going up\nagainst him would crumble against\nthe fear of being destroyed.\nRhys Kilian joined the team this\nyear as a wide receiver however, his\nversatility and experience meant that\nhe was playing in other positions\nsuch as quarterback and running\nback, through which he performed\nphenomenally. Loved throughout\nthe club, Rhys will be missed on and\noff the field.\nNoach Ben-Haim, undoubtedly\none of the best receivers this team\nhas ever seen, has been with the\nclub for two years and before that,\nplayed at Coventry University as\nEverybody through the tunnel. Photo Credit: Imperial Immortals\nOld faces make an appearance at American Football\u2019s Bath match\nThe\nImmortals\nwere\ndetermined\nnot to end\nthe season\nwith a loss\na wide receiver as well. His speed\nand strength have been such an\nimportant part of this team\u2019s offense\nand he has had many highlights\nincluding his one handed reception\nin the last game.\nKevin Kim has played since 2011,\nstarting out as halfback then wide\nreceiver then quarterback this year.\nHe is known around the team not\nonly for being extremely tough\nwhen it comes to receiving hits, but\nalso for being an all round fabulous\nperson. He has lead our team to\nmany touchdowns and he will be\nmissed.\nPaulius Viskis, an absolute beast\nof a defensive player, has played\nfor three years as a linebacker and\na defensive end. His brute strength\nwould cause any quarterback to\nshiver in fear.\nRayane M. Jackson also played\nas a defensive lineman and\nrunning back and is well known\nfor being a monster both ways.\nHis determination and passion has\nbrought the team up many times\nand his craze for sacks has led to\nhim to becoming an amazing player.\nFinally, Alex Brockhurst, ex\ntreasurer and current sponsorship\nsecretary for the club, has been\nin many positions including\nlinebacker, safety, corner back and\nrunning back. He has always been a\nmassive part of the team, whether it\nis on the field or behind the scenes\nin terms of running the club. He is\ntruly a tremendous player causing\na lot of havoc for anyone going up\nagainst him.\nThe club would like to thank all\nthe leavers for their contributions\nand we wish them a successful\njourney for the rest of their careers!\nAs is our\ntradition\nafter every\nlast match\nof the\nseason, the\nImmortals\nformed a\ntunnel for\nthe leavers\nA big shout\nout to the\noffensive\nlinemen\nwho\nstepped up\nMedals aplenty for the rowers\nNewcastle\u2019s BUCS Head up proves a successful trip for the team\nToby Heaton\nWriter\nF\nor Imperial\u2019s rowers,BUCS\nHead was moved from\nthe metropolitan Boston\nto the tropical Newcastle\nthis year (a Head race is a rowing\ntime trial, rather than a side by side\nrace). ICBC sent up 22 of our finest\nathletes to compete on the Sunday,\nin an attempt to prove that the\nstrength of our squad is defined by\nquality, not quantity.\nAfter a seven hour drive up to\nNewcastle on the Saturday morning,\nthere were doubts about the race\ngoing ahead at all. The conditions\nwere abysmally windy and choppy\nduring our paddle on Saturday\nafternoon and we came off the water\nwet, cold and apprehensive about\nthe racing tomorrow \u2013 the forecast\nwas only meant to get worse.\nAfter a hearty meal from some\nuncomfortably friendly Northerners\nand a good night\u2019s sleep in the\nfinest accommodation north of\nthe M4, the crews were ready for\nthe first races of the day. The first\nboat to race the 4700m course was\na coxless four of Andrew Halls\n(Club Captain, 4th\nyear Materials),\nJames Redhead (Civ. Eng. exchange\nstudent), Alex Ball (2nd\nyear Mech\nEng) and Juha Lepannen (3rd\nyear\nMathematics). This crew raced\nwell, navigating the unfamiliar\nTyne river to secure a silver medal\nin their Championship category,\nbehind the home favourites of\nNewcastle University.The next crew\noff was a coxed four of Ben Thomas\n(Environmental Tech. MSc), Toby\nHeaton (2nd\nyear medic), Tristan\nVouilloz (3rd\nyear Mech Eng), Ollie\nHines (3rd\nyear Theoretical Physics)\nand cox Chris Au (Environmental\nTech. MSc). This crew managed to\ndo one better than their teammates,\nbeating Edinburgh and Newcastle\nto win a gold medal.\nThe final crew in this division\nwas a lightweight (less than 75kg)\ncoxless four of Paul Jones (PhD\nBiomaterials), Romain Barnoud\n(PhD Computer Science), Rob\nMcPherson (2nd\nyear Materials)\nand Myles Holborough (3rd\nyear Materials). The four upheld\nImperial\u2019s strong lightweight track\nrecord by winning a bronze medal\nin their category. The afternoon\noffered more challenges for the\nrowers. Wind had picked up,\nmeaning that the racing would be\nslower this time round.It was time to\nbring out the big guns for the finale\nof the weekend\u2019s racing \u2013 the men\u2019s\neights. We had two eights racing at\nBUCS: one championship eight,\ncontested by British universities\nfor the fastest student eight in the\ncountry, and one intermediate eight.\nOur intermediate eight was made\nup of people ICBC coached from\ncomplete novices at the start of the\n2014/15 academic year. The crew\nwas Dugald Fraser, Tom Burnell,\nJac Reid,Fabio Albertani,Lawrence\nJones, Vitaly Delve, Paul Li\u00e9tar, JT\nBaird and cox Emily Boother. This\neight would be competing against\nuniversity second eights, because\nof the ruling against entering more\nthan one boat in a championship\nevent. Our championship consisted\nof some familiar names: Romain\nBarnoud, Toby Heaton, Ben\nThomas, Ollie Hines, Tristan\nVouilloz, James Redhead, Andrew\nHalls, Myles Holborough and\nChris Au. The eight set off second,\nfollowing Newcastle down the\ncourse and brought the prized gold\nmedal home to London! Finally,\nthe intermediate eight put in a\nstorming performance to come 5th\nwhen competing against far more\nexperienced rowers.\n22 athletes sent up to Newcastle,\n22 BUCS medals brought back to\nLondon.

A truly well\nE\nntering into the second\nterm of the last year of\nmy Joint Maths and\nComputing Degree, I\nthought to myself, \u201cHow can I\ndistract myself from my work in a\nridiculous way I haven\u2019t tried yet?\u201d.\nHaving already become captain\nof the most obscure sport on the\nplanet (underwater hockey \u2013 don\u2019t\nask), and literally played God in a\nDramSoc play last year, I decided\nit was time to actually become\nGod. Sadly, gaining omniscience\nis fairly difficult, so I settled on\ndirecting. Sadly, nobody liked the\nplay I wanted to do, so I settled on\nassistant directing someone else\u2019s.\nThe play in question is Birdland,\nby Simon Stephens. It follows Paul,\na rockstar at the height of his fame,\nhis subsequent downfall, his descent\ninto madness, and how it alienates\nand destroys his relationships\nwith everyone around him. The\ndialogue is sharp and witty, and it\nprovides interesting commentary\non the celebrities of modern society.\nArmed with a script, budget, and a\nproducer prodding us to get on with\nit, we began our search for our cast.\nAuditions were one of my favourite\nparts of directing, as I got to see the\nwide range of acting talent we have\nright here at Imperial.\nHaving being told Leonardo\nDiCaprio sadly wasn\u2019t available, we\nsettled on our cast over Christmas,\nand rehearsals began. For the last\nsix weeks, Jack Williams (the\ndirector) and I have been blocking\nout scenes, bringing out emotional\nperformances, telling actors to \u201cact\nhigher and/or drunker\u201d,and making\nPaul a bigger dick than we thought\npossible. I\u2019ve loved every moment of\nit.\nFrom the initial idea to the\npolished performance, every actor\nbrings their own spark to a scene,\nand it\u2019s the collaboration that makes\nthe play great. \u201cTry it and see\u201d has\nbecome one of my favourite lines,\nbecause even the weirdest sounding\nideas can really make a scene.\nSitting back and watching a play\nBirdland on stage for the first time.\nThe cast are all fantastic, having\nreally grown into their characters;\nthe crew are also fantastic, pouring\nnights and days behind the scenes to\nThe Life of Paul.

Imperial did return\nFELIX's request for clarification.\nWhilst the short letter starts\npositively, listing the benefits EU\nmembership provides, it goes on to\nsay that leaving would mean\u201ccutting\nourselves off from established\nnetworks\u201d and would ultimately\n\u201cundermine\u201d Britain\u2019s position as a\nE\nngland's Junior Doctors\nare set to strike again with\nthree 48-hour walkouts\nplanned for the coming\ntwo months, meaning that planned\noperations and procedures may well\nbe affected, but emergency care will\nbe maintained.\nThese strikes, to be held on 9th\nof March, and the 6th\nand 26th\nof\nApril, are the consequence of the\nimposition of a new contract on\nthe Junior Doctors last week by\nhealth secretary Jeremy Hunt, a\ncontract which the British Medical\nAssociation (BMA) said would be\n\u201cbad for the future of patient care,\nthe profession and the NHS as a\nwhole\u201d.\nThe disagreements between the\ngovernment and the BMA largely\nrevolves around patient safety,\nworking hours and basic pay rates,\nas well as what constitutes overtime,\nespecially on weekends.\nIn the mean time, Junior Doctors\nhave launched a legal challenge\nagainst the government over the\nimposition of the contract. They\nhave applied for a judicial review\nto challenge the decision, and are\nexpected to argue that the ministers\nhaven't properly investigated\nwhether the new contracts will\ndiscriminate against part-time\ndoctors, and so likely unfairly\nimpact women.\nAfter a ballot conducted in\nNovember showed that 98% of\nthe BMA\u2019s 38,000 strong cohort of\ndoctors supported industrial action\nin protest to the contracts, Hunt\u2019s\npopularity has been slim among\nthe profession and the wider public\ntoo.

Photo Credit: Netflix\nWhat if the Doctor was a mind-controlling murderer, rapist and sociopath? Photo Credit: Netflix\nL\nately there\u2019s been some\nstrong comic book TV\nadaptations debuting,\nranging from the gritty\natmosphere of Daredevil to the fun\nand colourful world of the Flash.\nMarvel\u2019s Jessica Jones manages to\nbring another successful, while at\nthe same time different, mood to\nthe table. Focusing on the more\nshady side of the Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse, the show has very much a\nnoir feel to it.\nThe show features Krysten\nRitter as our titular hero, a hard-drinking PI with superpowers and\na mysterious past. Ritter is on full\nform, being perfect as Jessica Jones,\nsomeone with rough edges who\u2019s\nbeen driven into a more secluded\nnature due to the terrible stuff she\u2019s\nbeen through. She has the right\nbalance of wit and arrogance and\nin spite of everything, still has an\ninnate desire to help others and be a\nhero.It\u2019s nice that in spite of the wall\nshe\u2019s built up around her, she has\nempathy for the people victimised\nby the villain Kilgrave and the main\nfocus of the show is her efforts to\ntake him down.\nDavid Tennant gives an amazing\nperformance as Kilgrave, being as\ngoodasVincentD\u2019onofrioasWilson\nFisk in Daredevil, if not surpassing\nhim.Kilgrave has the ability of mind\ncontrol, making people do whatever\nhe wants them to while at the same\ntime being a narcissistic sociopath\ndomination. He simply acts in the\nmoment, doing whatever\u2019s on his\nmind with anyone who\u2019s present. At\none point he remarks how difficult\nit must be not to have his powers,\nshowing how deranged he truly is.\nIt\u2019s a testament to Tennant\u2019s acting\nskills that he can charm you with\nhis humour and likeability, even\nmaking you sympathise with him at\ntimes,before turning and reminding\nyou why he\u2019s so repulsive.\nAn interesting choice made by the\nshowrunner, Melissa Rosenberg, is\nnot to shy away from the fact that\nKilgrave is a rapist, both mentally\nand physically, and tackles head\non the consequences of what he\u2019s\ndone to so many people and how it\nchanges them. The show takes the\nidea of a supervillain to its scariest\nand most evasive place while making\nsure not to lose focus or devalue the\npeople who have been victimised by\nhim. The writers don\u2019t back away\nfrom this and give opportunities\nto show how the characters process\nwhat has happened to them and\nwork on what to do next in wake of\nsuch a violation.\nThe remaining supporting\ncharacters are also portrayed well\nand help to bring out different\naspects of Jessica\u2019s personality.\nCarrie-Ann Moss as Jori Hogarth is\na ruthless and manipulative lawyer,\nbeing a shark of the world of law\nwhile Jessica\u2019s neighbour Malcolm,\nportrayed by Eka Darville, is\nsympathetic and endearing. Wil\nTraval portrays Will Simpson, an\nadaptation of the character Nuke,\na cop who only sees things in black\nand white and has the aura of\nhaving something off about him.\nMike Colter as Luke Cage proves\nhe\u2019s more than capable of having\nhis own Netflix series, being tough,\nstrong and sharing great chemistry\nand sexual tension with Jessica.\nThehighlightsupportingcharacter\nis Rachael Taylor as Trish \u2018Patsy\u2019\nWalker as Jessica Jones\u2019s adoptive\nsister and best friend. She acts as a\ncontrast to Ritter\u2019s character and it\u2019s\ngreat seeing how, while being polar\nopposites of each other, the two\nwomen support and complement\neach other.\nA weak link of the series is the\ncharacter Robyn, another one of\nJessica\u2019s neighbours. She\u2019s unlikable\nin all her appearances and too\nheightened and farcical for this\nworld. It doesn\u2019t help that she gets\nmore involved in different plot\npoints as the show goes along. The\nnumber of time and scenes spent on\nHogarth\u2019s marital issues, despite the\npayoff, felt like a bit too much.\nAlso, like Daredevil before it,\nJessica Jones felt like the more\nstronger episodes came a little\nbefore the end. I\u2019m not saying the\nending isn\u2019t good ,but the build up\nwas done much better.\nHaving said that, Jessica Jones\nis still a true triumph adding\nsomething different to the superhero\ngenre. It\u2019s the most adult entry from\nthe Marvel Universe with plenty\nof R-rated violence and a frank\ndepiction of sexuality.To the show\u2019s\ncredit, none of these scenes feel as\nif they\u2019re present for shock value or\nfor show, but rather help depict the\nharsh and brutal world of the story.\nJessica Jones is a grim show and\nreally creepy at times. However,\nit\u2019s a compelling series from start\nto finish with an excellent lead\ncharacter guiding us through the\ndark and murky underbelly of the\nMarvel Universe.This is a stand out\nseries, not just for Netflix\u2019s line up\nbut also for the ever-growing world\nof superhero shows in general and is\ndefinitely worth a watch.\nJessica Jones is available on Netflix\nNo sympathy for the devil. Photo Credit: HBO\nT\nhis show really snuck\nup on me. HBO seems\nto have pushed it out\nwithout the sort of\nfanfare one would expect; especially\ngiven the names attached to this\nproject. When Martin Scorsese\nand Mick Jagger say they\u2019re doing\nsomething together, you pay\nattention. So, I decided to give the\ntwo hour premiere (directed by\nScorsese himself) a chance.\nWas it worth it? Well, mostly.\nThe series has certainly managed\nto capture my attention, although,\nperhaps not as strongly as I\u2019d have\nliked. And, it is not without a few\nissues that keep it from reaching the\nheights I hoped it would. That is, so\nfar, at least.\nFirst though, let\u2019s discuss the\ngood. The series explores the\nmusic industry in the 70s; mainly\nfollowing record label executive\nRichie Finestra (featuring Bobby\nCannavale in a rare starring role)\nas he attempts to stay on the wagon\nwhile keeping his company alive.\nThe performances are all solid, and\nthe show manages to pull together\nquite an eclectic cast. Sporting the\nlikes of Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple,\nand, most bizarrely, Ray Romano;\nthere really is nothing but praise to\nkeep hooking the audience back,\nand keeping us on our toes as the\nshow went on.\nI\u2019m still interested though, and\nthe characters and acting mean I\u2019m\ninvested enough to keep watching.\nUltimately, I have faith in Scorsese\nto give us and interesting and\ngripping new series.\nVinyl is available on Sky\nThis opening episode definitely\ndrags on for too long, and it lost my\ninterest slightly towards the middle.\nIt also throws a lot of dangling plot\nthreads at the viewer from the outset;\nslightly overwhelming us, and\nmaking each one seem less weighty.\nThese should really have crept in\nslowly as the series progressed, and\na few particular ones (no spoilers)\nwould have served as great ways to\nSaad Ahmed\nTelevision Editor\nA\nvengers Earth\u2019s Mightiest\nHeroes is a fantastic\njourney into fun and\nadventure, with writing\nthat embraces the best elements of\nMarvel media as well as the original\ncomic book roots. With well done,\nserialised storytelling, an excellent\nvoice cast and superb animation,\nAvengers EMH is a lot of plain,\nawesome fun that anyone can enjoy.\nThis show adopts the nature of\ncomic book stories well, having big\nadventures with ongoing plots and\nsubplots to keep you going and\ncraving the next installment. It does\na fine job of retelling and adapting\nclassic stories while being original\nand keeping things grounded in its\nown universe. This series features\nall the major highlights of the\nMarvel films plus more. It does its\nown spin on plots like the Winter\nSoldier storyline and an invasion of\nan alien race. Without the demands\nof a film calling for more grittiness\nor realism, this show is able to show\nthe best of the Avengers. While\nsometimes serious, the show is not\nafraid to let the more fantastical\nelements of comics to appear.\nThe show also features a large and\nrotating team of Avengers. Each\nmember of the team has their own\nquirks as well as their time to shine.\nThe show makes you interested and\ninvested in all the characters, even\nwith the likes of Hawkeye. The\ncharacters themselves have their\nown developments and journeys,\nwhether it\u2019s Thor and his qualms\nwith his family or the Hulk trying\nto gain acceptance from others.\nSpeaking of characters, the\nshow features a ridiculously large\nleads his own Avengers team into\naction.\nThe voice-acting of the show is\ntop notch. Every character sounds\noriginal and organic, some of\nwhom sound uncannily similar\nto their movie counterparts. The\nanimation is also a treat, with a\ngenerous amount of detail as well\nas engaging and blockbuster-like\naction sequences. Occasionally the\nstories are simple and generic and\nsometimes plot threads are dropped,\nonly to be picked up much later. In\nspite of this, every episode is a blast\nto watch.\nThis show only did last two seasons\nbefore it was axed making it join the\nranks of awesome shows cancelled\nbefore their time. With amazing\ncharacters, and great stories, this\nshow was a love letter to decades\nof comic book mythology. If you\u2019re\nimpatiently waiting for Marvel\u2019s\nfilms, this is a show that\u2019ll keep you\noccupied until then.\nAvengers Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes\nis available on Amazon Prime\nAssembled we\u2019re strong; together fight as one. Photo Credit: Disney XD\nThis series\nfeatures all\nthe major\nhighlights of\nthe Marvel\nfilms plus\nmore\nnumber of people from the Marvel\nuniverse. Practically all the major\nAvengers villains are shown,\neach with their own motives and\nobjectives. There is also a number\nof supporting characters as well as\nguest appearances from heroes like\nthe Fantastic Four and even the\nGuardians of the Galaxy. In one\nepisode, Spider-man forms and\nbe had here. All the classic Scorsese\nhallmarks are also here; from the\nprotagonist\u2019s verbose narration \u00e1 la\nWolf of Wall Street and Goodfellas,\nto the occasional surreal sequences.\nIn this piece, they take the form\nof cutaways to renditions of iconic\ntracks performed by representations\nof the relevant icon.\nOn the topic of the music; the\nsoundtrack, and its integration\ninto the episode is just fucking\nawesome. There\u2019s also some great\nuse of visual metaphors throughout;\na particularly effective example\nbeing in the closing sequence of the\nepisode.\nAs I said earlier though, the\nepisode isn\u2019t without its problems.\nAll the\nclassic\nScorsese\nhallmarks are\nalso here\nSaad Ahmed\nTelevision Editor\nJessica\nJones,\nsomeone\nwith rough\nedges who\u2019s\nbeen driven\ninto a more\nsecluded\nnature\nwith absolutely no morality or\ncode.

Rayman Legends,\nLittleBigPlanet, Bionic Commando,\nand Shadow Complex are all notable\nfor their presentation, whether\nrealistic or stylised. Innovating\nwithin the platforming genre is\nhard, so developers often use visuals\nto distinguish their work.\nUnravel is by all accounts beautiful.\nIt focuses on the miniature, with a\nsmall protagonist known as Yarny\n(made entirely from red yarn).\nTrees, twigs, and rocks become, as\na result of Yarny\u2019s size, relatively\nmassive structures within the game\nworld. Small rodents, birds and\ncrabs become large, threatening\nenemies.This magnified world, with\nits almost lifelike graphics, evokes a\nreal sense of exploration and awe in\nthe player.\nThediverseenvironmentsrepresent\nmore than just places, they hold the\nmemory of an old woman whose\nhouse acts as the hub world.Yarny is\na physical representation of her love,\ncrafted by hand, with the red yarn\nthat trails behind connecting her\nmemories to help her reminisce.The\nmemories that the player collects as\nthey traverse the world exist only\nfor a brief moment, and even then\nthey are obscured and blurry. The\ntrials and tribulations of the player\nrepresent the struggle of someone\nlooking back on their past, hoping\nto find something to comfort them.\nThere is a sadness and loneliness in\nUnravel that underpins everything.\nWhat really sets Unravel apart\nfrom other platformers, is the literal\nunravelling of the character you\nplay as. The red yarn becomes a\nsupport, a rope swing, a lasso, and\na trampoline. It\u2019s length is limited,\nforcing the player to carefully\nthink about the order of their\nactions. Unfortunately, many of\nthe environmental puzzles feel like\nthey are impossible to complete the\nfirst time you\u2019re faced with them.\nConstant deaths, which cause you\nto respawn at a checkpoint, ruin the\ngames otherwise leisurely pace.This\nis where Coldwood Interactive\u2019s\npuzzle-platformer ultimately\nunravels; there is no balance\nbetween punishment and reward.\nUnravel is a classic case of style\nover substance. However, its style\ncannot, and will not, be ignored.\nThere are a few games that look as\ngood, especially from development\nteams this small. More frequent\nrespawn points and less timing-based puzzles could have made\nUnravel a truly exceptional game.\nUnravel is out now on PS4, Xbox\nOne and PC\nThere is a\nsadness\nand\nloneliness in\nUnravel that\nunderpins\neverything\nUnravel is a\nclassic case\nof style over\nsubstance\n\n"

The play relies on a\ntotally immersive sound experience\ndue to the lack of other actors and\nscenery. This is made possible by \u2013\namong other things \u2013 the strange\nhead, which is revealed to be a\nbinaural microphone \u2013 one which\nrecords sound in three dimensions.\nIn this threadbare setting, he begins\nto weave the almost hallucinogenic\nfabric of a totally different world.\nWe were asked to switch off\nMcBurney\nevokes\npictures of\nthe Amazon\nrainforest\nusing his\nown voice\nas an aural\npaintbrush\nHe weaves\nthe fabric\nof another\nworld\nour mobile phones at the start of\nthe performance \u2013 not unusual.\nBut now it seems all the more\nappropriate as we find ourselves in\nan \u2018auditory plane\u2019 soaring above\nthe ground. Suddenly, McBurney\u2019s\ndaughter\u2019s voice interrupts him and\nhe begins to have an exasperated\nand very real conversation with her,\nalthough her voice is actually a six-month old recording. And so, the\nentire mood and cleverness of his\npiece is set from the off: where does\nthe boundary lie between the past,\npresent and future?\nA performance which involves\nthe audience wearing headphones is\nat first slightly disconcerting. I am\nused to seeing, hearing and reading\nstories, but this was an entirely new\nexperiment in storytelling: I was\nliving the tale. McBurney evokes\npictures of the Amazon rainforest\nusing his own voice as an aural\npaintbrush, along with items on\nthe stage and at times a classical\nsoundtrack.The art he creates ranges\nfrom stomping out the hauntingly\nrhythmic beats of a tribe\u2019s strange\ndance to sloshing a water bottle\nuntil it is a turbulent river. All this\nalong with his convincing rendition\nof the deep American accent of\nLoren McIntyre, whose voice\nseems to evoke the presence of the\nphotographer with us.\nMcBurney\u2019s voice and the sounds\nof the Amazon are just \u201cbehind\nyour frontal lobe\u201d as he himself\nput it; both physically and \u2013 as we\nwere soon discover \u2013 mentally. In\nthe play McIntyre\u2019s adventure in\nthe rainforest transcends into a\nphilosophical journey and this is\nportrayed very effectively. It is said\nthat radio sparks the imagination\nand television kills it, and this\nwas never more evident: soon, I\nmyself began not only to hear the\nKayapo warriors move through the forest; in The Encounter Loren McIntyre, an American photographer searches for the Mayoruna .

This non-linear\nview of time and space is also\naccepted in physics where time\ncan have multiple dimensions, and\nyet it never seemed so tangible as\nwhen listening to the, at times,\ntrippy performance. We sometimes\njump, not only through McIntyre\u2019s\nlife, but through McBurney\u2019s own\npast which in a way mirrors the\nstory, further creating a sense of\ndiscontinuous time and drawing\ninto question the vague boundaries\nbetween people\u2019s lives.\nThis is a performance of\nalternating senses of togetherness\nand isolation. The simple lighting\nprovides a powerful mental stimulus\n\u2013 adding character to the sound\nyet not detracting from its impact,\nbecoming at some points rain, and\nat others fire. In the background,\nthe anechoic wall upon which\nmuch of the lighting dances is\nshaped as such that it looks like a\nlarge optical illusion, appropriate\nto the psychedelic and almost\nuncomfortably deep experience that\nMcBurney is planting while inside\nour heads.\nMuch of the piece\u2019s brilliance\nstems from the fact that McBurney\nknows many of the ideas he\nwishes to share are not explainable\nin words. This phenomenon of\ncommunication through thought\nas opposed to language is a theme\nMultiple\ndimensions\nof time\nseem\ntangible\nessential to the story, and is in a\nsense shared with the audience due\nto the way the story is told.Darkness\npervades the piece, alluding to that\nempty void full of sound within our\nown heads.\nOverall, I would describe this\nproduction not as a production\nbut rather more accurately as a\ntimeless piece of art about nature:\nas a brilliant performance which\nmanages to capture the essence\nof an exotic location and people,\nbut also the nature of our own\nminds whether time really exists\nas we know it. Rest assured you are\nguaranteed a powerfully moving\nperformance.\nWALEED EL-GERESY\nThe Encounter is on at The Barbican\nuntil 6th\nof March.

There are no\nother voices in this narrative, no\nprops or distractions. The only\nornament of this stage is just a girl,\nhalf-formed.\nShe is a stranger just yet.\nBy the end, we know her story\nintimately \u2013 we know her intimately.\nIf we look hard enough,we can even\nrecognise a part of ourselves in her.\nBased on Eimear McBride\u2019s novel\nof the same name, A Girl is A HalfFormed Thing was adapted for the\nstage by Annie Ryan,and performed\nsolo by Aoife Duffin. This play\nfollows the journey of a girl from\nbirth to the golden age of twenty.\nTold from the girl\u2019s perspective, we\nhear a stream of thoughts and inner\ndiscourse as her life meanders into\nadulthood.\nFar from the predictable coming\nof age story, this is about finding\nstrength and fortitude in the face of\na cruel reality.The girl is abandoned\nby her father shortly after birth.\nShe must cope with a controlling\nmother and the everyday reality of\nher brother\u2019s terminal illness. She\nis sexually abused by her uncle at\n13. Sex becomes an escape and an\nanaesthetic for her. Her exploration\nshows that female sexuality is a\npowerful thing: both a crippling\ncurse and a powerful gift for a young\nwoman in today\u2019s world.\nDespite the manifold,she remains\nresilient in her search for meaning\nand a sense of self.\nThe unflinching inner life of a girl growing up\nAnisha Kadri\nWriter\nEimear McBride\u2019s astonishing novel is transformed into an empowering performance\nThis is a play of striking simplicity.\nMost modern plays seem garish\nand superfluous. The bare stage\nbecomes Aoife\u2019s playground as\nshe paints us a scene beyond the\nsparse set, mixing the bold outline\nof her body language with the more\nintricate brushstrokes of her speech.\nAlthough the language of the play\nis indicative of the its Irish roots, it\ndoesn\u2019t really matter where the story\ntakes place; its narrative is distinctly\nuniversal.\nThe real magic comes from the\nmasterful scripting. The syntax has\na poetic rhythm to it, but ventures\nbeyond the limits of literary\nconvention. Surprisingly, her words\nremain relatable, maintaining an\nunflinching honesty. Like the girl in\nthe title,her thoughts and her words\nare half-formed, fragmented, and\nhurled at us with no apology, fast\nand slow, hitting each point with\nsearing precision.\nThe play tackles a much more\ngeneral commentary on society,\nand childhood. It would be unjust\nto relegate this play to any single\ngenre. Empowering for people of\nall genders, it demonstrates a great\nbeauty in resilience.\nAn exceedingly experimental\ntheatrical adaptation, A Girl is A\nAoife Duffin delivers a captivating solo performance in A Girl is A Half-Formed Thing.

I found it perhaps one of the dullest, uninspiring,\nhollow films I\u2019ve seen in recent memory; while in the\ncinema it may seem like a real journey, but looking back\nyou are hit with the realisation that the film actually says nothing\nof interest or note. Spotlight could be a dark horse, as could The\nBig Short, but really I feel like the award would serve the film\ncommunity best by going to Mad Max: Fury Road. An inventive,\nhigh-octane, perfectly-balanced film, Fury Road creates a world\nfilled with improbable characters and highly-detailed ecosystems\nand after the credits roll you wish you could stay longer \u2013 surely the\nmark of a great film. It would also help break the drama homogeny\nthat has consumed the Academy,showing us that an action film can\nstill have great merit.\nBest Director\nWill Win: Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (The Revenant)\nShould Win: Lenny Abrahamson (Room)\nI\nt looks like I\u00f1aritu will win this award for the second year\nin the row for his work behind the camera in The Revenant.\nReally it would be no surprise: Academy voters enjoy it\nwhen things are spelled out for them, and The Revenant is\nso stuffed full of technically impressive shots that voters can sleep\neasy knowing there is indeed someone giving the film direction.\nHowever, I prefer those whose work is a little less obvious; I think\nit takes much more skill to create a tightly controlled drama, and\n(glossing over the outrage that Todd Haynes wasn\u2019t nominated)\ntherefore I think the award should go to Lenny Abrahamson. Not\nonly does he delicately handle the brutal subject matter of sexual\nabuse story Room, but he also ekes out two of the most genuine\nperformances in recent years, from Brie Larson as Ma, and the\nstunning, revolutionary Jacob Tremblay as Jack.\nBest Supporting Actress\nWill Win: Kate Winslet (Steve Jobs)\nShould Win: Rooney Mara (Carol)\nB\nookies have Kate Winslet down as the likely winner,\nfollowing her performance in Danny Boyle\u2019s Steve Jobs,\nduring which \u2013 dodgy Polish accent aside \u2013 she showed\noff her powerful expressiveness. The dark horse of the\nrace could be Alicia Vikander, who acted Eddie Redmayne into a\ncorner in The Danish Girl. Jennifer Jason Leigh is unlikely to get the\nnod, although The Hateful Eight marks a welcome resurgence in her\ncareer. Similarly, Rachel McAdams was possibly the best actor in\nSpotlight, but probably won\u2019t hold up to the others. For me, Rooney\nMara deserves to take home the award for creating the complex,\nemotionally-layered Therese Belivet in Carol; unfortunately,\nthat role lacked bombastic moments or hysterical outbursts, and\ntherefore will be overlooked by the Academy.\nBest Actress\nWill Win: Brie Laron (Room)\nShould Win: Cate Blanchett (Carol)\nI\nn direct contrast to the offerings on display in the Best Actor\ncategory, I can\u2019t remember a year when the Best Actress race\nhas been stuffed with such fantastic performances. Out in\nfront for me are Charlotte Rampling, for her devastating turn\nin 45 Years, Cate Blanchett, who formed the foundation of Carol,\nand Brie Larson, for her stunningly affecting performance as abuse\nsurvivor in Room. While Saoirse Ronan was charming in Brooklyn,\nand J-Law was bolshie in Joy, neither of them can match the others\nin terms of the power of their performance. Smart money is on\nLarson to win on the night, and though I will be happy for her,\ndeep down I feel Blanchett outstripped all competition with her\nnuanced, controlled performance as Carol Aird.\nBest Actor\nWill Win: Leonardo DiCaprio (The Revenant)\nShould Win: Nobody\nG\nod, this is a bad year for actors. Following on from his\nwin last year, Eddie Redmayne put in an offensively\naffected performance in The Danish Girl, meaning real-life trans pioneer Lili Elbe had no resemblance to any\nhuman being I have ever met. Similarly, Bryan Cranston portrayed\nDalton Trumbo as a collection of bizarre tics given human form,\nusing a voice that suggested toothache. Matt Damon was adequate\nin The Martian, but for a film that is basically centred completely\naround him, he made very little impact. I haven\u2019t seen Steve Jobs, so\nI can\u2019t comment on Michael Fassbender,but I don\u2019t know if it could\nbe worse than the others. All signs point to this award going to\nLeonardo DiCaprio for his role as grizzled survivalist Hugh Glass,\nshowing that to win an award you don\u2019t need to show nuance or\nskill, just a willingness to grunt a lot and eat bear liver on screen.\nBest Supporting Actor\nWill Win: Sylvester Stallone (Creed)\nShould Win: Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies\nM\naybe it\u2019s the theatre snob in me, but I would love it\nif Mark Rylance takes home the award. Legendary\nfor his theatre work, not least as artistic director of\nThe Globe, Rylance\u2019s performance in Bridge of Spies\nis magnificent, and recognition would show the worlds of film and\ntheatre are not as distinct as people think. As Soviet spy Rudolf\nAbel, Rylance brings a sense of deadpan humour in his controlled\nperformance, and is the best thing in Bridge of Spies. I don\u2019t think\nTom Hardy\u2019s performance in The Revenant was worth shouting\nabout, and similarly Christian Bale\u2019s nomination for his blunt\ntreatment of hedge funder Michael Burry is baffling. Mark Ruffalo\ncould be a possibility, given his outburst of energy in Spotlight, but\nultimately I think Sylvester Stallone will nab it, less for his turn in\nCreed, but more for recognition of his decades of work.\nBest Original Screnplay\nWill Win: Tom McCarthy & Josh Singer (Spotlight)\nShould Win: Tom McCarthy & Josh Singer (Spotlight)\nO\nut of the five nominees for this award, only two have\ncome up with truly inventive ideas: Ex Machina and\nInside Out both tell completely original tales, one\nlooking to our childhood past, the other to a potential\nfuture. The others all take on real-life happenings: Cold War\ncounter-intelligence swapping in Bridge of Spies; the Catholic\nchurch molestation scandal in Spotlight; and the rise and fall of\nN.W.A. in Straight Outta Compton. However, while it is tricky\ncreating something out of nothing, it is arguably more difficult\nto tackle a historical event and afford it the required gravitas and\nrespect. This is exactly what Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer have\ndone with Spotlight, which manages to present an immensely\ncomplex and controversial topic without a sense of dumbing things\ndown for the audience.\nBest Documentary\nWill Win: Amy\nShould Win: The Look of Silence\nI\nknow people say let bygones be bygones, but I can\u2019t help feel\nthat this year\u2019s award should go to The Look of Silence, if only\nto compensate director Daniel Oppenheimer for the fact that\ntwo years ago his absolutely mind-blowing documentary The\nAct of Killing lost out to 20 Feet From Stardom,a documentary about\nbacking singers.The Look of Silence may not be as powerful as his last\nfilm,but history calls for reparations.Ultimately,however,the award\nis likely to go to Amy, Asif Kapadia\u2019s portrait of Amy Winehouse,\nwhose descent and death is played out in graphic detail. Whilst\nthe film relies on footage obtained by the paparazzi who arguably\nhelped drive Winehouse to her death, and its voyeuristic feel makes\nyou feel complicit in her addiction and downfall, Amy would be a\nworthy winner.\nBest Original Score\nWill Win: Ennio Morricone (The Hateful Eight)\nShould Win: Carter Burwell (Carol)\nA\nll signs point towards Ennio Morricone winning this\nfor his scoring of Tarantino\u2019s Western The Hateful Eight,\nand why not \u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful piece of work, managing\nto be stirring,exciting,but never overbearing.You might\naccuse Morricone of ripping off tropes of Western music, but he\npretty much invented them. Star Wars has its usual John Williams\ntreatment, but does he really need a sixth Oscar? You\u2019re getting\ngreedy John. Similarly, Bridge of Spies has a perfectly perfunctory\nscore from Thomas Newman,all swelling strings,but any Cold War\nfilm that doesn\u2019t make use of Nena\u2019s \u201899 Luftballons\u2019is dead to me (I\nknow it was set decades before Nena released this banger, but really,\ndoes that matter? No. The answer\u2019s no.) However, Carol-lover that\nI am, I would love for this to go to Carter Burwell, for his delicate\ncompositions, which complement the tightly controlled drama.\nBest Adapted Screenplay\nWill Win: Adam McKay and Charles Randolph (The Big Short)\nShould Win: Phyllis Nagy (Carol)\nP\nity the voters for this award; few Academy voters actually\nwatch the films nominated, let alone go through the\nhassle of reading the books they were based on, and this\nmeans that the skill of many brilliant screenwriters has\nnot been recognised. Out of the last five awards, four have gone to\nfilms based on non-fiction books, perhaps reflecting the difficulty\ntackling such subject matter can pose when compared to pieces of\nfiction. As such, it is likely that The Big Short will win, and while\nthe screenwriters\u2019 effort to make such an elephantine topic as the\nhousing collapse accessible in an 120-minute film is admirable, I\nwould love to see the award go to Phyllis Nagy for her pitch-perfect\nadaptation of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s The Price of Salt, which retains\nall the brittle sharpness of the original text, and is the most faithful\nadaptation I have possibly ever seen.\nBest Cinematography\nWill Win: Emmanuel Lubezki (The Revenant)\nShould Win: Edward Lachman (Carol)\nA\ncinematographer can make or break a film \u2013 and yet the\nrole is often overlooked by cinema-goers. This year the\naward will inevitably go to Emmanuel Lubezki for the\nthird year in a row, for The Revenant \u2013 it\u2019s probably fair,\nsince the scenic shots are by far the best thing in the film. Vittorio\nStoraro does equally good work in The Hateful Eight, although\nthe interior shots means he can\u2019t show off his chops; and in Mad\nMax John Seale takes us through the entire colour spectrum,\nfrom blistering reds to cooling blues. However, I think shooting a\nbeautiful film is easier when you already have natural beauty in front\nof you; it takes something more to take a city street,and capture the\nurban magic through the grime. And that\u2019s why I think Edward\nLachman should win, for his sensuous portrayal of NYC, heavily\ninfluenced by Saul Leiter\u2019s masterful photography.\nBest Animated Feature\nWill Win: Inside Out\nShould Win: Inside Out\nN\now, I hear Anomalisa is supposed to be brilliant. It\u2019s\nnot out until next month in the UK, but the buzz\naround it is that it\u2019s a subtle, nuanced, beautiful piece\nof work \u2013 which means that it will undoubtedly lose\nat the Academy Awards. Luckily, it seems that the award will go\nto Inside Out, which would be a completely worthy winner. Taking\na look at the interior life of a child going through a rough patch,\nInside Out connects us with our childhood memories, managing to\ncommunicate vastly complex psychological and emotional concepts\nwith an ease that belies its ingenuity. Inside Out marks perhaps a\nreturn to form for Pixar, which is joyful news in and of itself. Oh,\nand it made me weep like a baby 10,000 feet above the Atlantic,\nglass of plane wine clutched in my hand. Make of that what you\nwill.\nour picks for the Academy Awards\n\n"

So when 2nd-year\nphysicist Nick Bradley secured the\npart of Sweeney - undoubtedly one\nof the most coveted characters in all\nof musical theatre, and in his debut\nperformance with the society no less\n\u2013 quite a few people were surprised.\nWhile Nick, at 6\u201911\u201d (at a guess),\nis as physically imposing as they\ncome and is known throughout\nthe college for the quality of his\nbeautiful singing voice, he\u2019s one of\nthe last people you would guess is\nlikely to grab the nearest razor and\nbegin slashing merrily away.A night\nin the union with him reveals in\nhim an aptitude for banter, a pining\nfor New Orleans, and a passion for\nmusic but not a thirst for blood.\nHowever, the second the cast\nsaw Nick perform \u201cEpiphany\u201d,\nthe turning point of the musical\nand arguably the most exhilarating\nnumber in a show full of exhilarating\nnumbers, everything became clear.\nIt turns out that the man of many\ntalents is also an exceptional actor.\nDuring the first run of the show the\nonly note director Pete Noden made\nfor the scene was \u201cNick \u2013 a little bit\nof wee came out\u201d.\nNick leads a colourful and\nexceptionally talented cast of\ncharacters as they tell the tale\nof Todd, a barber wrongfully\nimprisoned who has escaped\ncapture and returned to London.\nEncountering his old neighbour\nMrs. Lovett, he plots his revenge\nwith her on the Judge that sent him\naway and took his daughter. Along\nthe way he meets a na\u00efve young\nsailor (played by myself), a half-crazed beggar woman, an \u201cItalian\u201d\nbarber and his servant boy, and a\nbeadle working for the judge. As\nthe story unfolds, these characters\ncollide with each other in ways that\nwill impact them forever.\nWhilst the story itself is thrilling,\nthe legendary musical score\n(composed by the great Stephen\nSondheim) is what makes the show\nthe masterpiece it is.Tackling one of\nthe most challenging productions in\nall of musical theatre was something\nthat the entire cast found daunting\nas the rehearsal process began, but\nunder the rigorous musical direction\nof Henry Harrod each number has\nbeen polished clean as a whistle.\nIt has been woven together with\ndexterity into a sonic tapestry that\nglistens more and more brilliantly as\nthe show progresses.\nHenry\u2019s commendable efforts\nin finding a top-quality band have\nalso paid off \u2013 at the first band\ncall when I sung \u201cJohanna\u201d, one of\nthe most well-known songs from\nthe show, I was filled with a new\nlove for the number as I heard the\nThe Demon Barber of Fleet Street takes a turn on Exhibition Road\nbeautifully powerful swell of brass\nthat underscores it.\nThe songs themselves also give\nthe performers a chance to shine,\nand each and every member of the\ncast has risen with gusto to the\noccasion. The exceptional singing\ntalents of the ensemble gives every\nchorus number a strength that\nsends chills down the spine, and the\nleads match that power with their\nperformances; standouts include\nEmma Watson\u2019s portrayal of Lovett,\nwith a belt range that would put\nany performer to shame, fresher\nFergus Wade\u2019s mesmerising turn\nin the role of servant boy Toby, and\nEhsaan Shivarani\u2019s show-stopping\nappearance as barber Adolfo Pirelli,\nwho leaves the audience laughing\nwith every minute of the little stage\ntime he has.\nThe directors\u2019 choice to include\nsongs that are traditionally\nconsidered optional also bolsters the\nperformances of the leads; first year\nchemical engineer Laurence Ankers\u2019\nportrayal of the beadle Bamford\nexplores the attics of the human\nhearing range with his high notes,\nHatty Campbell\u2019s beggar woman\nfully expresses every dimension\nof the haunting character, and\nArun O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s Judge Turpin\nhas his shocking chance to make\neveryone in the audience squirm\nin discomfort. Roshani Abbey is\nalso a highlight, showing off her\nbeautifully smooth soprano range\nin the heart-warming \u201cGreen Finch\nand Linnet Bird\u201d solo.\nIt has to be said that the duets are\noften the most stunning part of the\nshow; the fabulous interweaving\nthat builds between the four voices\nof Anthony, Johanna, the Judge and\nthe Beadle by the end of \u201cLadies In\nTheir Sensitivities\u201d is truly magical\nto take part in, and a moment that\ntook place in AS2 when glittering\nrays of sunshine danced through\nthe windows and onto the backs of\nMTSoc\u2019s Sweeney Todd will get your blood pumping Photo Credit: Cem Hurrell\nNick and Emma as they performed\nthe breath-taking duet \u201cMy\nFriends\u201d remains the highlight of\nthe rehearsal process for me.\nWhile I enjoy nothing more\nthan to wax lyrical about the power\nof the show, and while listening\nto the soundtrack can do a lot\nto communicate the thrill of the\nmusical, there truly is no substitute\nfor seeing these exceptional\nperformers in the flesh. So gather\nround and attend the tale \u2013 it runs\nfrom the 2nd\nto the 5th\nof March in\nthe Union Concert Hall, and tickets\nare already selling like hot pies.\nIt promises to be a truly unique\nproduction, and is likely to be one\nof the best in MTSoc\u2019s history.\nTo get your ticket, visit https://\nmtsoc.co.uk/tickets/\nOne of\nthe most\ncoveted\ncharacters\nin all of\nmusical\ntheatre\nThe duets\nare often\nthe most\nstunning\npart of the\nshow\nTom Stephens\nWriter\nThere\ntruly is no\nsubstitute\nfor seeing\nthese\nexceptional\nperformers\nin the flesh\nO\nn 17th\nFebruary 2016,\nthe 5th\nNew Financial\nWorlds Conference\nwas successfully held\nat the state-of-the-art Bloomberg\nAuditorium in London.\nThe day was split between\nInvestment Banking and Global\nMarkets. The diverse range of\nspeakers left attendees with an\nunparalleled understanding of the\ntwo areas. With an inside-scoop on\nhow to break into these exclusive\ndivisions from the industry\u2019s best,\nattendees are now better equipped\nto differentiate themselves amongst\nthe fierce competition.\nThe day started with a talk\nfrom a Managing Director at the\nInvestment Banking Division of\nGoldman Sachs. Having worked\nat the division for close to 20 years,\nhis extensive experience quickly\nexpanded attendee\u2019s knowledge on\ndebt financing and LBOs.\nThe next speaker was Omiros\nSarikas, a principal advisor at AHV\nAssociates LLP, a private equity\nfirm. With a long track record in\nM&A and PE/VC, he diligently\nexplained the life cycle of a fund,\ntheir position in the financial world\nand how attendees should align\nthemselves to the industries\u2019 needs.\nChristopher Wickli from Citi\nrounded off the Investment Banking\nsession with an excellent summary\nof what ECM involves and the\ncharacteristics that make a successful\nbanker in this area. The first Global\nMarkets speaker was Nigel Khakoo,\nthe Global Head of FX Trading at\nNomura International, who focused\non Abenomics and derivatives.\nUsing a recent example he explained\nthe use of options in order to take\nadvantage of central bank events.\nOur final speaker, Marc Mourre\n(pictured), the former Vice\nChairman of Commodities at\nMorgan Stanley, is widely acclaimed\nas one of France\u2019s most famous\nbankers and, true to expectations,\nprovided an eye-opening view on\nthe future of the oil sector.\nMarc Mourre giving a talk on the future of the oil sector.

Indeed, for anyone\nIC Finance Society hits 2000 members\nL\nast Tuesday Imperial\nCollege Finance Society\n(ICFS) successfully\novertook Medical\nEducation(thebiggestdepartmental\nsociety) in terms of membership. By\nFriday, ICFS reached yet another\nmilestone by becoming the first\nsociety to exceed 2000 members.\nWhat is it that has brought\nmore students together than\nany department at Imperial? As\na career-orientated society, the\nmain focus of ICFS is organising\nevents for its sponsors. Networking\nsessions and trading games had\nattendance at an all-time high,\nwith several boasting more than\n200 attendees. Some students even\nreceived invitations for an interview\nthe following day and secured their\ndream job as a result. In particular,\nICFS caused a riot outside Eastside\nbar when hundreds of suit-wearing\nmembers queued for a chance to rub\nshoulders with City professionals\n(and free pizza!).\nIt\u2019s not all to do with finance,\nthough! ICFS also held its first ever\nsocial event \u2013 those that gave it a\nchance had one of the best nights\nof their life, with food and drinks\non us all night. Our annual dinner\npromises to be even better with\nmore than \u00a370 subsidy per person.\nWe also heavily subsidise our\ntwo international trips: the New\nYork trip with all expenses paid for\n22 members (including one lucky\nwinner of a completely free trip!)\nand the Tanzania microfinance trip,\nwhichgivesmembersanopportunity\nto volunteer their skills to help\ngrow small sustainable businesses\nin close-knit communities. We also\nteamed up with RAG to promote\ncorporate social responsibility by\ndelivering the Charity Challenge of\n2016, where Raincatcher Imperial\nwon \u00a31500 for their outstanding\ncharitable efforts.\nFollowing on from the success\nof our New Financial Worlds\nconference at Bloomberg HQ, we\u2019re\nalso hosting the London FinTech\nConference 2016 in collaboration\nwith other universities. CEOs\nand leaders of ground-breaking\nstartups will discuss the future of\nthe industry, with an opportunity to\nnetwork and potential job leads.\nWe also hosted the University\nInvestment Banking series, where\nboth categories were won by\nImperial teams, beating the likes of\nCambridge and LSE.\nTheteambehindarecord-breaking\nyear is the ICFS committee, who\nhave dedicated a lot of their free\ntime to using the resources they had\navailable to the best of their ability.\nThe result is clear: our members\nhave gained insight into the\nindustry, made good contacts\nand had fun while doing it. With\nelection time looming, people are\nextremely determined to be on next\nyear\u2019s ICFS team- it has accounted\nfor around 200 new members. Will\nyou be part of our story?\nIskren Peev\nWriter\ninterested in finance, attending next\nyear is an absolute must considering\nthe insight you will gain, as well as\nthe exclusive and diverse network\nthat you are sure to build.\nImperial College Finance Society successfully hosts the Conference for its 5th\nyear\nProvided\nan eye-opening\nview\nThe gang.

Photo Natasha Khaleeq\nD\noctors are not going to\naccept the new contracts\nthat Jeremy Hunt is\ntrying to impose on\nthem,so they\u2019re planning three more\nstrikes as well as launching a judicial\nreview.The government condemned\nthe announcement, arguing that\nthe contract will improve services.\nHowever, Dr Johann Malawana\n(leader of the BMA junior doctor\ndivision) states that the general\nconsensus amongst junior doctors\nis rejecting the imposition: \u201cthe\ngovernment must put patients\nbefore politics.\u201dAlso the BMA have\nfound legal grounds for a challenge\nand if the Equality Act (2010)\nequality impact assessment has not\nbeen carried out, they will take the\ngovernment to court. However,\nDanny Mortimer, chief executive\nof NHS Employers stated that the\nmajority of the BMA\u2019s concerns\nhad been addressed in the final\ncontract and urged junior doctors\nto reconsider.This is the most bitter\nclash since the creation of the NHS.\nA\nt Sh!t Sc!ence, we argue\nthat all research, no\nmatter how ridiculous,\nhas a purpose and brings\nus all closer to the truth.\nThis week: penguins. You thought\nyou knew just how adorable\nthey were, but that was until you\nheard the news that makes them\nfrigging awesome. Fat penguins are\nscientifically more likely to fall over.\nThis is what results from a study\nhailing from the University of\nRoehampton suggest, in a paper\naptly titled \u2018Fat King Penguins\nAre Less Steady on Their Feet\u2019.\nThe authors reminds us that\nvery comprehensive studies have\npreviously shown that pregnant\nwomen and very fat people, have a\ncompletely different gait than thin\npeople (would we dare to say they\nwaddle more?). So applying this\nresearch to penguins just makes\ncommon sense, really.\nAnd this story just keeps on\ngetting better. To substantiate their\nMARIANNE GUENOT\nSh!t Sc!ence\nThin penguins waddle, but fat penguins wobble\nclaims, they captured fat penguins,\nput them on a treadmill, and filmed\nthem. Which means that now, all\nover the internet, are videos of\npenguins on a treadmill!\nThe results show (who cares, at\nthis point, right?) that although the\ngait and stride length of penguins\nremain the same, regardless of\ntheir weight, fatter penguins have\na higher \u201cleaning angle and leaning\namplitude\u2019\u2019. Translation? Fatter\npenguins waddle normally, but they\nwobble more! Complete happiness\nensues.\nThis all sounds mildly ridiculous,\nbut as always, it serves a greater\npurpose. This research subscribes to\na wider line of enquiry called gait\nanalysis, the study of locomotion\nof humans and animals. Carefully\nstudying the dynamics of humans\nwhen their motions are hindered,for\ninstancebydebilitatingdiseasessuch\nas Cerebral palsy and Parkinson\u2019s,\nhas helped doctors develop new\ntreatments and surgeries. Studying\nthe gait of animals can give us a\ndifferent insight into dynamics\nof locomotion, which can, for\ninstance, help us develop more\neffective robots.\nThe gait of penguins has been\nstudied since the 1970s, and\nhas been puzzling scientists\never since. Whereas penguins\nseem very at ease in water,\npart of their life cycle involves\ntraveling huge distances on land,\npainstakingly and awkwardly\ndragging themselves step-by-step while conserving enough\nenergy for them to make the\njourney, sustain themselves, and\nfeed their female and newborn\nchick. Studying their gait can\ngive us insights into a previously\nuncovered mode of locomotion.\nSo next time you see a cute\nanimal doing something stupid,\ngrab a camera and immortalise\nwhatever shenanigans might be\ntaking place. For science!\n\u2018\u2018Sally, nobody likes a penguin that wobbles\u2019.\u2019\n\u2018\u2018You calling me fat?\u2019\u2019 Photo Liam Quinn\n\n"
