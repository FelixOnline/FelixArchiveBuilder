The committee\nmeeting on Thursday was\nheld specifically in response\nto the boycott. All that\nhappened during the meeting was a direct result of\nthe boycott. The blitz of\ncleaning, cull mina ting in Mr.\nMooney's inspection on monday morning, would surely\nnot have occurred if there\nhadn't been trouble brewing.\nThe main effect, however, is\nclearly a heightening of\nawareness of the problems.\nFelix Was the boycott a personal attack on Mr.\nMooney?\nJ.G. No, as 1 said in the\nbump h sheet. This was\ndirected against the whole\nstructure of, and complacent\nattitude to, college catering.\nMr. Mooney has a difficult\njob to do, and his difficulties\nare clearly aggravated by\nthe financial straightjackets\nimposed upon him.\nNo, this was an indication\nof the strength of feeling\nabout both the quality of\nmeals and the generally lax\nattitude of the authorities.\nFelix What are your reactions to the criticisms of\nyour publicity sheet?\nJ. G.Mr. Stephenson's criticism that the refectories\noperate within a budget is\ntwaddle. I made it quite\nclear that I was talking\nabout capital expenditure,\nnot current expenditure. An example of this is the provision of a washing-up\nmachine in Southside. An other example is the repair\nof the fabric \u2014 in Southside\nthe cockroaches nest behind\nthree missing tiles. It seems\nto me that some people are\nopposed the discussion of\nany form; viz Mr. Stephenson's moans about Felix\nFelicity and the Sun at the\nemergency refectory committee meeting. If he thinks\nhe has cause for complaint\nlet him come to the Massive\nMooney Meeting and expound in public.\nMore tasty morsels to be found on the floor in Southside.\nThe Boycott\nThe Southside refectory\nboycott happened last Tuesday (the 20th),5 days after\nthe Union meeting had decided to hold it.\nPublic relations were done\nover the weekend, with the\nproduction and distribution\nof 1000 bump h sheets. These\nproduced reactions from Mr.\nStevenson, amongst others.\n(See interview).\nForewarned, the usual\nS. S. clients were not unduly\nsurprised to meet with a picket line when they arrived\nfor their Tuesday midday\nMooney. Corbyn, Webb and\nButterworth, and many\nmore, did sterling work in\ngentle persuasion; nevertheless about seven people did\ninsist on breaking through\nthe line.\nAfter a while it was\nrealised that people were\nsimply going upstairs to the\nsnack-bar, and that food was\nbeing taken up there. The\npickets spread their sphere\nof influence to the snack\nbar instantly. Thus was the\nboycott effected!\nIt was reported that some\nrolls were taken over to the\nshop, but since nobody knew\nabout that, very few were\nsold. The shop as a whole\ndid record business.\nPickets wandered away\nabout 1.30, and some people\nwandered into the refectory\nrather mystified about the\nlack of activity.\nSince nobody quite knew\nwhether the boycott was all\nday or lunchtime only, and\nnobody was prepared to de-cide, no pickets turned up in\nthe evening. This is reputed\nto have surprised the staff,\nwho were expecting a lazy\nevening and had gone home.\nFew attend\ndiscussions\nThe Monday lunchtime\ninformal discussions in the\nElectrical Engineering Department have been suffering from a lack of patronage\nrecently. The discussions,\nusually after a short introductory chat cover anything\nfrom birth control to trams.\nLast year the discussions\nwere well attended by students and staff, but now\nboth seem to be missing.\nSandwiches, biscuits and\ncoffee are provided in the\ncommon room of level 6 at\n1.00 p.m. everyone welcome\nwho wants to air views on\nthe subject being discussed.\nArchitectural\nAssociation\nFurthei to the article on\npage one concerning the\nArchitectural Association,\nthere will be a happening in\nthe Great Hall, College\nBlock, at one o 'clock today.\nThe A. A. is putting on some\nform of review, according to\nusually reliable sources, and\nas many people as possible\nare urged to attend to see\nthis amazing spectacle and\nmeet students from the A. A. Moon Film\nNot withstanding other attractions last Thursday\nlunchtime, about 300 students and staff heard Lt-Col\nWeiner of the USAF talking\nabout the Apollo project.\nLt-Col Weiner's talk was\nwell illustrated with slides\nand the IC premiere of the\nApollo 12 moon landing film\nrecently released by NASA. The audience seemed amused\nby the americanism s and\nappreciated Lt-Col Weiner's concern that parts of the\nfilm were American Propaganda which was too much\neven for a native! The talk\nwas concluded by a look at\nthe orbiting space station\ndue for launching in the\nmid-seventies; men will be\nspending up to two months\nengaged in astronomy and\nproduction of items such as\nball-bearings. In answer to\nthe question 'will the United\nStates put women into space'\nLt-Col Weiner said that it\nwas possible, but thought\nthey were too much trouble\non earth, let alone in space.\nOne and a half meetings\nSince your last succulent\nissue of Felix, there have\nbeen one and a half Union\nmeetings. The first meeting,\na fortnight ago, discussed at\ngreat length, a motion on\nstudent representation on\nvarious college committees.\nThis motion was met with a bewildered silence from the\nmajority of people pre scent, with only a handfull of non-apathetic s chanting \"co-adult\ncom unity\" at frequent in-ter vals.

In a discussion\nabout the length of queues\nit was revealed that three\nyears ago Mr. Mooney\nblamed this on the students\nwho wasted time hesitating\nbetween one succulent dish\nand another. A point of information from the floor\nrevealed that the frequency\nof appearance of meat balls\non the menu would be\ngreatly reduced if the cockroaches were removed. The\nmotion was passed and, for\nreports on the resultant boy-c ott, see the front page of\nFELIX. Carnival\nHappenings\nThe amazing Carnival\nConcert HiM happen to-night. Al Stewart and Brigid\nSt. John are appearing with\nGaswork in the College\nBlock this very eve, there\nare still some tickets left, so\nhere is a chance to hear good\nmusic, while it's on your\ndoorstep.\nJust for the novelty Carnival is attempting the first\never legal street collection\non the seventh of march, and\nyour help is needed to pull\nthis off.

So watch\nfor these or get information\nfrom the Carnival office.\nCAVING CLUB\nCarnival would like the\nsupport of more college\nclubs like the heroes in the\nCaving Club who were to be\nseen recently with helmets,\ncaving g rots, ladders and\nropes, travelling Underground to Westminster\nBridge. Upon arrival, three\npothole rs descended to collect samples of Thames\nwhile bemused passers-by\nwere relieved of surplus cash\nin aid of charity.\nThe police, who had been\nwatching this operation,\neventually recovered their\ncomposure and moved the\nintrepid explorers on. They\nthen decided to go down the\nKing's Road, where the in-habitants, noticing their\ntrendy gear, showered them\nwith further contributions.\nIn all, the total collection for\nHandicapped Children was\nover \u00a330.\nWhile on the subject of\nmoney it looks as though\nwe will have collected \u00a36,000\nby the end of term since the\nConcert is making a profit\nand another is likely later\non.\nAs a final remark, Carnival would like to get raffle\nticket selling over with soon,\nso could the books be\nhanded in as soon as pos-sib le. The meeting was adjourned for a week and reopened last Thursday to\nrubber stamp the quin que n niu m working party report.\nThe quorum was challenged\nand the meeting fizzled out\nwith a belch and a fart.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 2 FELIX 29th January, 1970\n\u2014FELIXPROBE\u2014\nSouthside Kitchens\nTwo weeks ago, Felix staff heard disturbing rumours concerning the State of the hygiene in Southside kitchens and\nincidents of cockroaches in the food. Felix staff therefore\nvisited the kitchens on a night early in the week, before\nFelicity broke the news.\nOn that evening, there had been a late evening dinner.\nFelix staff saw piles of dirty pans and unwashed plates left\nout in the kitchens overnight. Clearly the kitchen staff had\ndumped the dinner there and gone home!\nInsects, notably cockroaches between \\ and \\ \\ inches in\nlength, were crawling all over the walls and floors; the\nmachines, such as bacon slicers and potato peel ers, were\ncovered by them! Even more 'roaches were tucking into the\ntrays of old uncovered food, and also into uncovered food\nwhich the Felix staff thought would probably be used the\nnext day!\nIn all, the impression gained by Felix staff was one of\nextreme filth and bad hygiene.\nLeaving the dirty dishes, Felix staff moved on to investigate\nthe vegetable store.\nAs they opened the door, two mice ran out. Inside the\nstore-room, there were a few bags of vegetables, mostly\nonions, which were completely covered by insects. At the\nother end of the room, the floor was disgustingly dirty. Two\ntrays of old rat poison had been upturned, and a new one\nleft standing in the filth.\nAt least three of the Felix reporters present stated that they\nwould not eat at Southside again until the situation improved.\nTwo days later, Felix staff again toured the Southside kitchens in\nthe small hours. There were no unwashed plates, though not all the\npans had been cleaned, and trays of old food were uncovered. Two\ncockroaches were seen to crawl into a paper bag full of fresh bread\nrolls. A further few nights passed until Felix again looked in. The\nstandard of cleanliness was actually acceptable\u2014the reason is soon\nrevealed by the notice on the office door to the effect that:\nMr. Mooney has instructed the College Block cleaners to come\nover. You are to ensure that they get all the necessary cleaning\nstuff and that every inch of the floor, including various store-rooms, is covered, ready for inspection by Mr. Mooney on Monday\nmorning.\nIn other words, the situation was so bad that the Refectory Mana\nger had felt it necessary to call in extra help and give a full\nweekend's warning of an inspection!\nMOONEY A SPECIAL FELIX INTERVIEW V.J. G. Mooney The Catering\nManager at I.C. for the last\n16 years\nThis could be your last chance... Throughout the country, undergraduates have been reading our book-\"Graduate Careers in British\nLeyland''. And a lot of them have\nalready made appointments to see us\nwhen we call at their universities.\nSo the time is fast approaching when\nyou should do the same.\nWe are the only major British\nowned motor manufacturers, with\noutstanding technical\nachievements to our credit -the front wheel drive\ntransverse engine concept,\nhydro last ic suspension, gas\nturbine development, and a new alloy \"Prestal\". These achievements have made us the country's fifth largest company by sales value,\nand its largest exporter.\nSo we need graduates of all\ndisciplines, for fifteen major functions\nin six divisions of the Corporation.\nFull details can be found in our book.\nRead it, and make your appointment\nwith your Appointments Board before\nit's too late. Your Appointments Board\ncan give you a copy. Or write to\nDerek Beasley, Graduate Appointments Manager, British Leyland\nMotor Corporation, Berkeley Square\nHouse, Berkeley Square, London Wl.\nAfter the steady increase in the criticism of the\nRefectories by students, culminating in the boycotts of the Southside (see front page), Felix reporter Tony Kirkham went to see the Refectory\nManager, Mr. V.J. G. Mooney, to ask for his comments on the situation.\nMr. Mooney thought that the trouble had been brewing for about six months now, and that in his opinion\nthe Refectories had become the current target for\ncriticism. All the staff in the Refectories were tired of\nthis attitude, which was reminiscent of the way all\nschool-children automatically grumble about school\ndinners.\nAs for the Southside food, Mr. Mooney did not accept that\nthe standard was much lower than elsewhere. There were\nmany complaints last year, but now the work of the same\nchef in College Block was regarded as the best food in College!\nThe basic reason for all\nthe Southside troubles last\nterm had been the lack of a good chef. The man Mr.\nMooney had hoped to get\nto take over Southside had\nbeen unable to come after\nall; this was due to the 4\nmonth's delay in opening\nCollege Block. At the beginning of last term, Southside\nkitchens had been run by a succession of poor chefs, resulting in many complaints.\nHowever, halfway through\nthe term the chef from the\nstaff buttery at 170 Queensgate was transferred to South\nSouthside. This stopped the\ncomplaints, but this man was\ntaken ill shortly afterwards\nand so the kitchens had to\nstruggle on without a chef\nuntil Christmas.\nMr. Mooney also blamed\nFELIX and FELICITY for\ncreating an anti-Southside\nfeeling, and also grumbled\nthat it was difficult to communicate with the present\nICU Council. Moreover, he\nthought the comparatively\ndepressing atmosphere in\nSouthside did not assist enjoyment of the food.\nIn all, an unfortunate term\nfor the kitchens. But Mr.\nMooney is convinced that the\nstandard will improve soon.\nHe has a new and competent\nchef, with the recuperating\n\"170\" chef as second-in-command, and he looks forward to the complaints dying\ndown.\nThe number of meals\nserved in the lower Refectory at Southside has\ndropped recently, and\nnow only 400 lunches\nand 450 evening meals\nare sold. There has also\nbeen a drop in customers\nfor the waitress service\nSouthside restaurant,\nthough the snack bar is\nstill going strong.\nMost of the Southside\ncustomers have gone over\nto the College Block, although 200 have headed\nfor the Union lower re-fec tory, which now serves\nabout 500 per meal-time.\nThe total number of\ncustomers is, moreover,\ndown on last year by a sizeable factor.\nA pile of empty pans waiting to be washed up. When told\nof this, Mr. Mooney expressed surprise, and said it would be\ndue to staff problems.\nInfestation Moving on to the alleged\ncockroach infestation in\nSouthside, Mr. Mooney stated\nthat it was no worse than\nmost outside restaurants and\nconsiderably better than\nsome. He cited the Savoy\nwhere cockroaches are often\nseen crawling across the din-in groom floor!\nCockroaches were basically\nclean, harmless animals, despite their ugly appearance,\nand were a negligible health\nhazard. Of much more concern were the flies. College\nBlock in particular suffered\nfrom large numbers of flies,\na nuisance which started during the recent dustmen's strike. Also, the Union kitchens were troubled by many\nblack beetles coming out of\nthe heating ducts.\nIn Southside, the problem\nhad been declining for a number of years now, and\nRentokil hoped to drive out\nthe last 'roaches from the\ncrevices shortly. Moreover,\nthe Public Health Inspector\nwas offering advice.\nDirty Dishes When asked about the\ndirty dishes left overnight in\nthe kitchens in Southside, Mr.\nMooney said that the staff\nwere supposed to clear up\ncompletely and put away all\nfood before going home, but\nthey were often unwilling to\ndo this late at night. In College Block this was not a problem, thanks to a \u00a32,000\npot-washing machine, but in\nSouthside everything had to\nbe done b v hand.\nWork Study Lastly, the proposed Operations Research investigation\ninto his organisation. When\nsuch a study was done at\nDurham the suggestions in\nthe report were all \"uns at is factory to operate\" {Durham\nRefec. Manager), and so the\nreport was shelved. Mr. Mooney thinks the same will happen here, and all the report\nwill do will be to produce a large number of unworkable\nsuggestions at great expense.\n\n"

Perhaps they will yet prove that\nthey are not merely a bunch of drunken vandals, as many\npeople seem to think, but are in fact fine athletes, well trained\nas a team and excellent tacticians as individuals.\nBy the way, it seems to have gone un-noticed that\nI CW A Hockey have only lost one game this season.

Both\nKeith and Jim McCarty.\nand even the producer Paul\nSamwell-Smith, were under\nthe money making yoke of\nMickie Most, while John\nHawken is ex-Nashville\nTeens and Louis Cennamo\nis ex-Chicago Line Blues\nBand.\nTheir sound is un class if i able as John on piano and\nharpsichord, and Louis on\nbass have a pursuing\nclassical effect on Keith and\nJim's basic melodies.\nMany of the tracks are\nmade up of smaller sections,\neach identifiable with every\nwalk of life, but the entire\ncombination produces an\nalbum worthy of its title.\nOn \"Island\", the tune\nsung by Jane is^abruptly intercepted by harpsichord\ninstrumental and then returns at the end.\nI must admit that I identify the basic melody of\n\"Kings and Queens\" with\n\"Shapes of Things\", but the\nbuild up around it disguises\nthe original melody.\nLouis is an extremely\ncompetent guitarist and is\nmost noticeable on \"Inno-c en ce\" while I like harpsichord on \"Wanderer\". The\nlongest track \"Bullet\"\nseemed to drag without\nache i ving any positive ob-j ect ive, sadly. Just as in the\nfourteenth century, Renaissance could be the start of\na new way of thinking,\nalthough I doubt if it will\nbe quite as revolutionary.\nTHE JOHNSTONS\n\"BITTER SWEET\"\nIRA 211\nThis group were the first\nto record \"Both Sides Now\"\nin Britain and on this\ntheir fourth album they do\na treatment of another Joni\nMitchell number \"Marcie\".\nThe title track is a Gordon\nLightfoot number, as also\nis \"The Gypsy\". The choice\nof material by this trio can\nhardly be said to be biased\nas it ranges from a medley\nof reels learnt by the\nguitarist Mick Moloney, and\nother traditional numbers\nlike \"The Spanish Lady\", a Dublin street song, to contemporary classics like\nLeonard Cohen's \"The story\nof Isaac\" and Ewan MacColl's \"Jesus Was A Carpenter.\"\nAn interesting collection\nof instruments is used on\nsome tracks and the finished\neffect shows them to be one\nof Britain's most consistent\nfolk groups.\nKEITH CHRISTMAS\n\"STIMULUS\"\nSF 8059\nPress adverts for this\nrecord read \"folk-rock for\nyour mind\", and, as a very\nearly release for Keith, is\nenough to promote considerable interest in him. Besides\nbeing an undergraduate at\nBristol, the fact that he dislikes the environment in\nLondon deters him from\nmaking many appearances\nhere. I was lucky enough to\nsee him play in the summer\nand was impressed by his\nintentness in playing.\nCOME THE REVOLUTION When the socialist peoples' paradise of I 'SK secedes from\nthe pawn of reactionary Imperialism, ULU, certain changes\nwill have to be made to prevent revisionist fascists and\ncapitalists from corroding our pillar of revolution.\nThe first step in our path is the suppression of that\napologist-fascist publication, FELIX. (N.B. The peoples of\nthe glorious USK use Afrikaaner Mike's definition of a fascist \u2014 one who disagrees with CEFE \u2014 instead of the\nImperialist's dictionary definition). The Editor of that rag,\nFELIX, must learn that he is not permitted to edit long\nand boring articles submitted by the peoples' representatives,\nnor is he allowed to publish any Xeptionally \"fascist\" rub-b ish! The oppressed workers who slave to put out this reactionary muck will be rehabilitated and be given- the\npri vele ge of duplicating USK maps and pump h sheets.\nIn order to maintain the high quality of USK socialism\ncertain words and views will have to be re-aligned. We\nhave already redefined fascist. The word \"please\" will be\nreplaced by \"we demand\"; \"scruffy yo b\" will in future\nsignify a socialist worker who has liberated himself from\nthe conventional regimentation of the capitalists; \"boring\"\nwill signify in most cases an explanation from first principles\nof Union doctrines; \"news\" shall mean \"biased comment\";\nand he who publishes the news shall be called \"the man\nwho sits behind the Editor's desk and publishes what he is\ntold to\".\nKarl X Bronstein\nRECORD\nREVIEWS\nOn this record he is backed\nby Mighty Baby and performs seven of his own com-positions.

The purpose of the exhibition is to try and illustrate some\nof the new toys and \"playable s\" now available to both young and old.\nIn the first of a number of brightly coloured rooms is arranged the smaller pieces of\nthe exhibition. These include a number of psychedelic jigsaws (very difficult), some mediocre dolls and puzzles, but also two \"Teddy Bears\" with rubber John Betjeman faces.\nThe latter \"Betjeman Dolls by John Haworth\" may be pulled into almost any deformity,\nwith little difficulty.\nCHOP\nFarther in is a gruesome\nassemblage of chains and\naxes carefully arranged in a wooden box. This game, yes\ngame, was aptly named\n\"Chop\" by its maker, Victor Newsome. Also included\nare a comprehensive set of\nrules but frankly this isn't the toy for 1970's Christmas\nstocking.\nNearby in a green-walled\nroom is a device for rearranging proverbs. Really\nthis is just a novelty but\nit's still surprising how much\nunconscious humour and\ndirt is hidden in these innocuous phrases. You might\nalso find a box that makes\nnoises, some building bricks\nhinged together, and a number of diabolically simple\njigsaws.\nNot far away is the next\nroomful of curiosities. Large,\nyellow and L shaped, in my\nmind it contains the more\nfascinating of the exhibits\ndisplayed. Lying on a couch\nare a number of red PVC\n\"limbs\" which clip together\nto form\u2014well that's up to\nyou. Opposite is a hanging\n\"tree\" of pale spongy\nmaterial \u2014 which to the\nuntrained eye could be mistaken for a collection of\nbaseball gloves.\nThe Politician by\nJohn Willats\nSub terra nia London New Arts Lab\nAt one end of Robert\nStreet are some red glass-panne l led doors reminiscent\nof a fire station, and written\nabove them 'Institute of\nResearch in Art and Technology \u2014 London New Arts\nLab'.\nInside two events are\nabout to begin: Warhols\nfilm 'Lonesome Cowboys'\nand 'The People Show' \u2014\n'somewhere to sit, something\nto eat and a place to be\nsick in' . . .\nA5/ ticket to 'The People\nShow' will buy you entrance\nand coffee, 6/6 soup and\nroll as well. You walk into\nthe room, dimly lit with\npink and green lights. Blocks\nof empty chairs are arranged\nat the far end. Beneath a lampshade hung with pipe\ncleaner swastikas someone\nis typing and beside them a gramophone plays dust-damaged Maurice Chevalier.\nSignificance seekers can reflect on a mound of assorted\nrubbish spread across the\nfloor. What about audience,\nactors, action? These are\nembodied in one and the\nsame person \u2014 you. The\nusher appears 'Is there anything madam would like?\nA newspaper, a bowl of\nsoup?' He returns with the\nEvening Standard. 'If there\nshould be an air raid, the\nshelter is through that door'\nDownstairs, macrobiotic\nfood \u2014 Japanese green tea\nand whole wheat buttered\nbread are on sale and International Times, Rolling\nStone etc from the books tall. Membership of the Arts Lab\nis 2/6 for one day (i.e. price\nof ticket + 2/6) or 10/- a year for students, only on\nproduction of N.U.S. card.\nHowever student membership (on production of your\nN.U.S. card and 10/6) of the\nNew Cinema club, which\nshows some of its films at\nthe Arts Lab, entitles you\nto go into programmes at\nthe Arts Lab, Round House,\nElectric Cinema Club and\nseveral other similar\nsocieties. The New Cinema\nClub is showing the Dylan\nfilm 'Don't Look Back' on\n3 February. Free programmes of films and details\nfrom the New Arts Lab, 1\nRobert Street, N.W. I, and\nN.C.C..122 Wardour Street,\nW. l. Frances Campbell\n3D Snakes and Ladders by\nKingston College of Art\nTIN MAN\nJust as curious but\napparently purposeless is a lifesize tin politician built\nby John Willats. On pressing a ballot card into an\nadjoining box, he will\nsimulate the actions of most\npoliticians by blowing into\na red balloon. Passing on\nit's difficult to miss a large\nwhite box whose lead is\nplugged into a wall socket.\nWhen in use it may be\ndriven around by operating\ncontrols inside. However,\nonce inside, there is no way\nof knowing in which direction you are travelling \u2014\nwhich could explain the fact\nthat it's not in working\norder.\nWhile some in my opinion\nare highly creative, other exhibits tend to be extensions\nof familiar toys; an example\nis the cuddly toy brand of\nsnake by Lise Bayer. Also\nan extension yet still somehow original is the 3-dimensional snakes and ladders\nbuilt by Kingston College\nof Art. Marbles replace the\nfamiliar coloured counters.\nART AT IC?\nThe exhibition might well\nbe beneficial and interesting\nto anyone in IC with even\nvague leanings towards art.\nOne of my own favourite\nexhibits, illustrates the now\npopular usage of the Sciences in Art. It's a walking\nrobot, built by Dick Bixby\nand Hugh Baird, called\nsimply Oswald.\nAnd for those who feel\nthe exhibition really did\nlift them to greater things,\nthere is on sale a collection\nof posters and prints of\nwidely varying design and\ntheme. Most are in a sensible\nprice range and would\nideally fill that blank gap\non your wall.\nART DRAMA\nTwo days from now, as\na part of the above ex hi bi tion. ICA is staging, what\ncan best be described as a happening by involving a computer in a dramatic\nproduction. The game/play,\ndevised by John Wood, will\nbe acted out by the Manchester College of Art and\nDesign Drama department\nat 12 noon, 2 pm and 4 pm.\nThe purpose of using the\ncomputer is to bring an\nelement of randomness into\nthe production, and each\nperformance is unique, the\nplot being dependent upon\nthe me chan is ed soundtrack\nand the rules of the game\nitself. The only constant in\nthe play is its title \u2014 \"King\nof Shouting House\" \u2014 and\nit is around the fantasy\ncourt of Shouting House\nthat the play is located.\nElectronic music is supplied\nby David Piper and direction was by Gerald McNally.\nThose interested might\nphone the Institute of Contemporary Arts 930-0493.\nAnthony Sims\nMalcolm Bailey\nOswald by\nDick Bixby and Hugh Baird\n\n"

They think for a start that it's uniformly\nwarm \u2014 the winters there\ncan be hell. Often trying to\ntalk about the conflict between the Afrikaner South\nAfricans and the English\nspeaking ones, I find that\npeople believe that all\nwhites in South Africa speak\nEnglish. Whereas in fact of\ncourse, the antipathy between the two groups is a key factor in South African\npolitics.\nIt arises out of the\nEnglishmen's contempt for\nthe Afrikaners' pastoral\nbackground, and the\nAfrikaners resentment at\nthis. At one stage, this antipathy could have been a possibility for diverting the\nAfrikaner (and thus South\nAfrica) from the paths of\ncapitalism; the old guard\nAfrikaner was very high-principled and not overly\nmaterialistic. (\"Scratch the\nback of an Afrikaner and\nyou find a Socialist\", said\nsomebody in 1939).\nBut, like most peoples\nbrought into contact with\nWestern culture and concepts of progress, the attraction of consumer goods,\nplastic pleasures and distracting comforts was over-w hel ming. And the story of\nthe Afrikaner in South\nAfrica of late is the story\nof a people learning and\napplying the aims of Western\nlife \u2014 material comfort\n(=money) and power.\nIn 1948, the Afrikaner\nachieved political power. It\ntook ten years for them to\nrealise something that the\nLabour Government here\npretend not to realise: that\npolitical power is not enough\nto control a country, you\nmust have a finger in the\neconomic pie.

GORMAN AND THE TRIP Films not blessed with\nthe approval of the British\nBoard of Film Censors,\nessential for exhibition in\nthe commercial cinema, provide film societies and\ncinema clubs (who don't admit the general public)\nwith the controversial\nmaterial which, depending\non one's attitude towards\n\"those who know best\",\nmakes film societies and\ncinema clubs either outlets\nof free artistic expression or\ndens of pornography for\nmoral deviants.\nRoger Corman, after a decade of directing science\nfi O tion and horror films has\nfallen foul of the censor with\ntwo films, \"The Trip\" and\n\"The Wild Angels\" which\ndeal respectively with drugs\nand motor-cycle rebels.\n\"THE TRIP\" was written\nby Jack Nicholson (the\nalcoholic lawyer of \"Easy\nRider\") and features Peter\nFonda and Dennis Hopper\n(producer, director and co-actors of \"Easy Rider\")\nSusan Strasberg and Bruce\nDern. The censor was clearly\nunimpressed by the charming note tacked on \"The\nTrip\" warning of the dangers\nof drugs: everything is\nshown to be quite ecstatic\nand pleasurable. Mr. Corman bases its plot less images on his own experiences under the influence of LSD as he\nfollows Fonda, as a disillusioned director of TV commercials, on a trip\naround town.\nBo Widerberg has directed six full length feature\nfilms. \"ELVIRA MADIGAN\" was released last\nyear and is in great demand\nfor film society screening\nafter wide distribution at\nspecialist cinemas in many\n1\nprovincial centres. It is\nbased on a true story, well\nknown in Sweden, of the\ndoomed love of a young and\nbeautiful tight-rope walker\nwith an army officer who\nleaves wife, children and\nrespected position to run\naway with her. The fate of\nElvira and Sixten (played by\nPia Degermark and\nThommy Berggren) is predestined since they cannot\ncompromise the life they\nwish for with life as it is;\nthey know that life must\nend. The visual and aural\nsettings of the story with\nromantic ravishing detail\ncreates a lyrical elegy of\nconsiderable beauty. Although \"Elvira Madigan\"\nwas in no risk of censor\ntrouble, \"Adalen '31\",\nWiderberg's latest film (now\nat Academy One, reviewed\nby Xris last term) may have\nbeen. Taking the romantic\nframework from \"Elvira\"\nit tells of a strike which provoked a riot and ultimately\nthe massacre of peaceful\nmarchers. It also tells of the\npersonal relationships within\nthe community; one particular scene of sexual exploration by hypnosis would almost certainly have been cut\na year ago; the fact that\nAcademy Cinemas have not\nexploited \"Adalen '31\" as\npornography (which it is\nnot) strengthens the censors'\ndecision.\nImperial College Film\nSociety will be screening\n\"Elvira Madigan\" and \"The\nTrip\" on Friday 6.2.70\n(details in What's On).\n\"Adalen '31\" and \"The Wild\nAngels\" are likely material\nfor screening next season.\nc0L CUT T So at last something has happened. The great mass of apathetic gits\nat I.C. have at last got off their fat arse s and done something concrete,\nsomething positive towards the A. A. negotiating impasse. It's a shame\nit won't do any good.\nIt won't| do any good because nothing we do in this place is taken\nseriously. We have the pantomime of J.U.R. G.O. \u2014carefully designed so\nthat nothing happens and no decisions are made; we have our menial\nrepresentation on all the committees of the college that don't do anything\nespecially useful; we have condescending statements made to us about\nhow important student participation is on a departmental level (i.e. where\nit won't have any effect); as long as we sit quite like tame cats lapping\nup our milk of mean ling less concessions then everybody will be happy\n\u2014I.C. will function smoothly for the benefit of the establishment from\nwhence it came; as soon as we do something, so everybody goes mad.\nAs I write this, it is the evening of the raid on the A. A./ I.C. negotiating\ncommittee meeting and two days after the boycott of Mooney. By the\ntime you read this, the administration will have erupted. We shall be\ndamned, criticised, condemned. We were militant. We were stirred up by\nmilitant agitators. We will be compared to L. S.E.A militant minority\nis misrepresenting the views of the majority, etc., etc.\nPart of this is partially true. Certainly those who took direct action\nwere not representative of the Union. But for all this is was a good thing,\nbecause it made the masses suddenly enlightened. 'Our aim is to make\npeople so conscious of their environment, that they will get up and do\nsomething about it' (\u2014Zappa). 'Our aim is to make people aware'\n(\u2014Corbyn). NOW, amongst all the accusations hurled against them, I.C. students will be able to get up and say how fed up they are with the\npatronising attitude of the administration. They can say that hey wan\nto be treated like adults and not a load of school kids. They alone can\n'tell it like it is'.\nBut will them? Are the events of the past week dynamic and momentous\nenough to arouse the dormant masses? They had better be; because unless\nwe unite now, unless we decide our policies and state our principles, unless\nwe can stand up for ourselves, I.C. Union will be finished, representation\nwill be finished, our contribution to the university will be finished, we will\nbecome a nonentity.\nIt really is now or never.\n\n"

The refectory com-mitte e, Mr. Mooney, and\nsome of his manager esse s also wish to attend a Union\nmeeting, to be held in the\nnext two weeks.\nThe refectory committee\nheld an emergency meeting\non Thursday (immediately\nafter the Union meeting).\nThis meeting accepted the\ninvitation to the food Forum,\nthought it was a good idea.\nApart from that, the meeting consisted of Mr. Stephenson complaining of the cockroach publicity in Felix,\nFelicity and the Sun. Mr.\nMooney related the saga of\nthe S/ S chefs; and suggestions on improving the\nwages and quality of the\nstaff. Students on the committee also asked the staff\nif they would condescend to\neat in lower S/ S at least once\na week.\nExplaining the philosophy\nbehind the motion John\nGoodman said that Mr.\nMooney had been complaining about a lack of communication between the\nvarious bodies concerned\nwith the refectories. In view\nof this and the fact that the\nstudent body had not had\nan opportunity to put forward constructive suggestions\nfor improvements, an open\nforum would be a good idea.\nThis would be attended by\nthe refectory committee, the\ncaterers, and a representative of the administration\nwould be invited to explain\nthe college's attitude (es-pec i ally to finance).\nThe question of a full boycott has been put off until\nafter the open forum, which\nwill almost certainly be on\nThursday 8th. Posters will\nbe circulated, and it is hoped\nthe Great Hall will be filled!\nStudents are asked to think\nof suggestions for improving\nthe college catering and also\no^ any complaints.\nThe Student's Case John Goodman, who organised the boycott, gave his\nviews in an interview with\nFelix.\nFelix Why did you arrange the boycott?\nJ. G.I arranged the boycott because of a general\nfeeling of discontent and\ndissatisfaction with college\nfood. The cockroaches were\nthe last straw, and it was\nclear that this was the issue\nto arouse the student body.\nFelix What were you trying to prove?\nJ. G.I was trying to prove\n(and succeeded in proving)\nthat direct action works. Mr.\nStephenson and the staff\nmembers of the refectory\ncommittee claim that the\n(Turn to Back page,\ncolumn 1)\nInconciusive Evidence\nLast week, a meeting of\nTizard Hall Disciplinary\nCommittee was held to consider the conduct of one of\nits members. The meeting,\nwhich was closed, considered\ninformation that Mike Muller had been found at 9-30\none morning with a woman\nin his bed. The information\n(unconfirmed) which FELIX\nlias, suggests that Miss\nSmailes, the Tizard house-keeper, was investigating the\nlack of bog doors on Muller's staircase. She went to\nsee the staircase rep. (Mul-ler) and saw two lumps in\nhis bed, one with a head\n(his) and one without a head\nin evidence.\nMuller wrote a poem to\nFELIX, (see page 3) which\nsays that he should not be\ncondemned for spending the\nnight a woman.\nIt is believed that this\nwould not constitute a defence at a Disciplinary Committee hearing and yet no\naction is to be taken due to\n\"inconclusive evidence\".\nFELIX concludes from\nthis that Muller denied the\n\"offence\" at the committee\nmeeting. Comment overheard\nin the Press Room\u2014\"There's nothing wrong in what I did, and anyway, I didn't do\nit.\"\nSome tasty morsels\nin the kitchens\nFelix asked Mr. Mooney\nfor his opinions on the\nboycott. He gave the impression of being upset and\noffended by the boycott,\ndespite John Goodman's assurances that the action was\nnot intended as a personal\nattack on him.\nIn his opinion the standard\nof hygiene in S/ S was acceptable and the food was\nnot any worse than the other\nrefectories. The boycott to\nhim was pointless; it would\nachieve nothing, and the\nonly people who would lose\nwould be the customers, as\nthe financial loss entailed by\nthe boycott could only be\npassed onto them.\nMr. Mooney said that the\nkitchen staff in S/ S were\nmore annoyed than he him-The\nOther\nSide\nof\nthe\nStory\nself was. The staff were particularly annoyed when they\ncould not recognise many of\nthe pickets as regular users\nof the refectory. They were\nalso offended that the students found their food in edi ble. Moreover, said Mr.\nMooney, there was the underlying fear that, if the\nsituation got worse, the kitchens might close and the\nstaff would almost all lose\ntheir jobs.\nMr. Mooney also mentioned that the boycott had\ntaken him by surprise. He\nhad only heard of it that\nmorning (tuesday) and did\nnot think that the students\nhad time to organise their\nprotest. In fact, he was preparing for the boycott the\nfollowing day, Wednesday.\nBefore and after Mooney Chip\ntil ii Violence\nflares at\nI. C.Hop Student\nbadly cut\nThe disco at the last I.C. hop had to be closed early\nfollowing some trouble between visiting skinheads and\na boy from Chelsea college.\nREPORTS differ as to the\nevents leading up to the in-c ident, but it seems that\nTerence Davidson was sitting\ntelling a joke to his girl\nfriend when a skinhead, who\npossibly thought they were\nlaughing at him, thrust a beer glass into Davidson's face, cutting it badly, Tim,\nthe DJ, closed the disco immediately and turned on the\nlights; a boy was apprehended at the door and was\ntaken to the police station for\nthe night. Earlier in the\nevening there was another\nincident in the Beit quadrangle which resulted in\nsomeone from the Health\nCentre being called to treat\na girl who was injured.\nThere were several skinheads at the dance but it is\nreported that all had Students' Union cards. The\ndance itself was a success,\nbut more as a concert given\nby the Procul Harum, since\nthere were so many people\nit was impossible for anyone\nto dance.\nObituary\nAlistair Buchanan\nThe R.C.S.

A. for three\nyears, he stimulated and infused new life into what was\nvirtually a dying Association.

    "content": "/9th January, 1970 FELIX Page 3\nED ON BOYCOTTS\nDISH-WASHERS\nAND C.E.F. E. So Piers awakens on a Tuesday morning and decides to\nhold a boycott of Southside Lower Refectory, Snack Bar\nand Shop. Naturally it was very effective, taking everyone\nby surprise, including the blok e who was to organise it,\nand causing Southside refectory to close down in the evening.\nThat there was cause for a boycott there is not much doubt,\nnot only in view of the cockroaches that even the food can't kill, but also considering the unwashed crockery and uncovered food left overnight; nevertheless, how did council\narrange it that the boycott organising should be left to the\nwhim of the president or any other one person? The only\nthing to recommend the way the boycott was held was the\nfact it worked.\nThe College Block refectories have the use of a dish-washing machine (at \u00a32,000) wh ics takes up a great deal of\nthe work-load which would normally fall on the kitchen staff.\nSouthside has no such machine, which could well account for\nthe aforementioned unwashed dishes which the staff would\nbe understandably reluctant to start on at the end of the day.\nThe purchase of such a machine for Southside would automatically cut down the amount of filth left in the kitchens,\nwhich is part way to solving the bug-problem.\nFinally, C.E.F. E., and 'is that fat cat getting lazy?'.\nThis is the sort of remark which fails to endear this so-called\nbranch of the I.C. left-wing to the FELIX editorial staff\nwho have to spend a good deal more time working on\nFELIX than they would like. We have dead-lines to meet\nand copy spaces to fill with a certain amount, and only a certain amount, of copy, so if C.E.F. E. or anyone else would\nlike to see a newspaper comprised solely of 1500 word articles\ndiversification, participation, representation, re sur gita tion, etc., etc., I suggest they write them themselves, post them to\nthemselves and read them themselves.\nPro-Felix\nself, or by allowing sub-editing by Felix.\nThe first point is more\nsubtle and strikes at the very\nroots of news coverage. Any\nnewspaper which has an intelligent readership of people\nholding all shades of opinion\non various subjects, must, if\nit is to be respected, present\nnews in a readable, informed\nand unbiased manner, and\nunder no account be a vehicle\nfor the personal views of the\ncontributor. Unfortunately\nsome of Felix's most prolific\ncontributors are suffering\nfrom the malaise of writing\nopinionated news and sometimes refusing to rewrite their\narticles in an unbiased form.\nIt is reasonable that if Felix\nis to maintain credibility as\nan informed disse minato r of\nnews throughout the college\nit must unfortunately refuse\nsuch biased copy, even if\nthis means that news coverage is not as adequate as it\ncould be.\nDAVE CHANT\nDear Ian,\nRecently Felix has come\nunder criticism over its news\ncontents, in that there isn't enough of it and that when\nprof erred, is often refused or\nradically altered by Felix\nsub-editors.\nThe first factor is partially\nexplain able by staff shortage\nand the lessening willingness\nof constituent colleges to forward copy usable in their\nown publications.\nOn the vexed question of\nrefusing news, this has arisen\nbecause some of Felix's valuable and original contributors\nseem to be losing sight of\n\"what is news and what is\nopinion?\" or sending copy\nwhich is important but in\na style which does not induce\na less involved reader of the\narticle to read the whole\nlength of the article or to note\nits most salient points. The\nsecond point is the lesser of\nthe two evils, and easily curable by the contributor him-THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nEDITOR: Ian Carr\nNews: Dave Chant, Ian\nWilliams and John Bowman\nFeatures: Tony Sims and\nFrances Campbell\nPhotos: Simon Hoyle, Andy\nThomas, Malcolm Bailey\nBusiness: Ian Quarrinton\nSports: John Darley\nWhat's On: Mark Hollings\nCirculation: Felix and Sennet\nRoger Lindsay\nTyping: Susan Parry\nChief Minion: Mister Anthony\nJohn Kirkham\nHelped by: Mike Yates, Pete\nMorgans, Arnold Darby\nThanks to: Piers Corbyn, John\nGoodman, John Schofield &\nJohn Ackers\nPrinted by: F.

Surely this is\na most important sector for\nexpansion. It is time to raise\nthese colleges from the second class alternatives to university that they tend now\nto be, and to divert from irrelevant occupations many\nprospective arts students.\nWhy?\nThe talk is of admitting to\nuniversity all those who are\n\"capable of benefiting from\nthe type of education uniquely available in universities\".\nWhat though is this education\nthat is so unique? Is it the\nmuch vaunted \"critical edu-cation\"? One would hope so.\nYet as we know, the present\nsystem does not provide this.\nAnd it is not entirely the fault\nof the universities. For they\ncan deal only with the products of the preceding sectors\nof education and it is probable that, if there were to be\nan emphasis on creative\nthought, many of the present\nuniversity students, with their\neducational backgrounds,\nwould not be able to cope.\nThis is why it is important\nto concentrate on the colleges\nof education. For if sufficient\nof the creative minds who\nwould otherwise be given a university education could be\ndiverted to colleges of e duca tion, the standards of teaching would rise, the type of\neducation would change and\nthe position would arise within a generation in which the\nmajority of school-leave rs could benefit from a critical\neducation.\nThat there is a need for a new approach in the pre-university sector is clearly\nevident; it is only some weeks\nsince the teachers were in the\nstreets and they're not only\nasking for money. Wouldn't it be nice if the government\nwere to take the logical step\nand attack the problems of\nteaching and education at all\nlevels, starting by attracting\n(or forcing perhaps, if you\nconsider the implications of\nexpanding the colleges of\neducation and not the universities) the 'better brains' back\ninto the schools.\nYours,\nMIKE MULLER.\nOPEN POEM\nAuthority\nwhy must you continually\nbug me ?\nYou see the things I 've got\nand call me\nbankrupt (morally)\nI'm not.\nYou find a woman in bed with me\no tragedy and scandal \u2014\nyour shocked faces\noutraged appearance\nmight lead people to believe\nthat I'm a vandal.\nYou take our expression of love,\nrub it in the dust\nlabel it \" HIS LUST \"\naccusing me of immorality.\nYou take her body\nsmeared by your hands\n(which are dirty)\nand accuse her of promiscuity !\nYou interrupt\nthe most beautiful\nmoment \u2014\nthen complain if\nI'm abrupt.\nYou (so you say)\nact this way\nonly till the day\nwhen we know/have accepted\nyour way\nas right.\nBut hell, I 'll fight!\nYou're not allowed to cloud\nmy light,\nshadow the bright moments of happiness ;\nrender impotent my bliss.\nI 've been living a while,\ntravelling and loving;\nmade friends in a hundred\nforeign tongues,\ndanced naked under their suns.\nAnd now, you dare accuse me\n\u2014 or did I expose your poverty\nof being happy !\nthe lackluster irrelevance of your reality?\nif so, I'm sorry.\nMike Muller\n\n"

However he probably won't go\non to say that the coloured\nchild gets considerably less\nfrom his years in school than\nhis white friends. This fact\nis very clear among the West\nIndian population of Notting\nHill where coloured children\nalways do less well academically than their white counterparts. The West Indian slave\nsociety\u2014in which the family\nunit was completely destroyed\u2014still leaves on the\nWest Indian character the\nscars of apathy and irresponsibility which perhaps\nonly time will remove com-p let ely. The environment of\nthe average West Indian boy\nis not in the least conducive\nto intellectual growth or\nsocial responsibility; and\nlastly his parent's attitude to\nhis education is likely to be\none of two things: either non\nexistent, or the 'work now\u2014\nPhoto: Reg Sacks\nWelcome to the rat race\nWe don't know why the rat has become the\npejorative symbol of the human condition.\nEverything struggles for survival; why single\none out?

We need chemists for Research and\nDevelopment, and for Marketing and Production,\nbut we need other graduates, too.

Thus both socially and psychologically\neverything works against the\nWest Indian boy making the\nmost of the education offered\nhim; and tends to leave him\nuninterested in anything\nother than the more frivolous pleasures.\nThis problem in the Notting Hill area was first tackled by the people of Community House; and was thus\nlinked through the Chairman\nof OSS, Keith Lindsay, with\nImperial College. Members\nof their Youth Groups were\nencouraged to bring along\ntheir homework problems\nand get help and advice from\nYouth Group organizers.\nThis really brought their\nneeds to light, and as a result one evening a week was\ndevoted completely to homework classes. In fact a two\ntier system evolved; firstly\na somewhat random system\nfor immediate help with particular problems which\nallows people to observe;\nand be observed. Secondly\na system of personal tuition\nwas set up for some of the\nboys. This tutor system has\nmany obvious advantages,\ngiving a feeling of continuity\nto both tutor and tu tee, and\nallowing the tutor quite intimate contact with the boy's milieu.\nA person from I.C. who\nagrees to help with these\nclasses will probably after\na short time of general help\nand observation, agree to\nbecome a personal tutor to\none of the boys; and to take\non responsibility for arranging lessons. Space\u2014although\nin short supply\u2014is available\nat Community House, but\noften tutors visit their pupil\nat home. In this way the\ntutor can become more\naware of the particular problems facing the boy \u2014 and\nalso getting to know the\nboy's parents can be very\nilluminating.\nThe details of the lessons\nare entirely a matter for the\ntutor\u2014but certain objectives\nare always kept in mind.\nAnyone teaching a secondary school boy must obviously to some extent teach\ntoward examinations, those\nteaching younger boys are\nluckier in having a broader\nscope. However the main objectives must surely be to\nhelp the boy appreciate\nscience and art as more than\nO level subjects and to introduce him to worlds of creative science and art. Also,\nand not less important, to\nhelp him, through his intellectual growth, to disentangle himself from his environment in order to be able\nto think about the problems\nof- society as a whole (into\nwhich he may have considerable insight).\nThis for me is where all\nthe enjoyment of this work\nlies: to try, while teaching\ntowards the obvious objective of O levels, to instill in\nmy pupil awareness; awareness of his own self; awareness of what he can be to\nsociety; and awareness of\nwhat he can inherit from\nsociety\u2014its past achievements and failures and most\nimportant its hopes for the\nfuture.\nTim Corn, Chem II\nCurrent Diversification\nAt their meeting on October 29th, the Board of Studies\nasked the Pro-Rector to oversee the current arrangements for\nthe provision of non-technical studies in the college and, by\nmeans of regular meetings with the staff involved in these\nactivities, to explore what can be done to meet the increasing\ndemand for these studies.\nAdministrative support is being provided for the ProRector by the General Studies Office. Mr. Goodlad of the\nElectrical Engineering Department is gathering information\nand convening informal meetings of interested persons.\nThe first meeting of the \"Diversification and Co-ordination\nCommittee\" is scheduled for February 4th. As 1C Union Academic Affairs Officer 1 have been asked to report on the\nviews of the Union. Apart from presenting the motions\npassed at Union meetings 1 should be interested in putting\nforward the views of those who are opposed to divers if ica tion, or in any way feel unhappy about it. Needless to say I should also like to hear from those interested in divers if ica tion!\nAreas in which people may like to express views could be,\nfor example, purpose of the UG degree, relationship of degree to future employment, development of individual talents,\ntype of diversification wanted (both technical and non-tech-n ical), should such courses be given in the first year or last\n(or indeed, throughout the three years), whether such courses\nbe assessed and if so what proportion of the total degree\nmarks should they carry and so on.\nIf you seek any specific information about current goings\non please see Mrs. Ward-Bailey, Room 572, College Block,\nand let me have your views and opinions as soon as possible.\nBrian Haines (IC Acad Aff Officer)\n\n"
