    "content": "22 Books Felix \u2022 22 November 1999\nThe Dating Game, Davina McCall\nExpect no great revelations. Dav in a McCall' s book is light, enter tai ning and completely unoriginal. There is nothing here that a couple of good mates couldn't have told you. This is a book for the tube. Light\nenough to carry around with you all day, interesting enough that you can ignore your fellow passengers, but not so enthralling that you'll\nmiss your stop. However, McCall is nothing if not thorough. She divides dating into six\nsections, beginning with 'the dilemma', passes through' how to meet a mate', 'first date protocol1, 'sex' and' couple dom' to end with 'splitting\nup'. Her knowledge is carefully divided into heart shaped bullet points\n(except in 'splitting up' where they're broken hearts) and the example stories are enclosed in boxes; presumably this is so you don't confuse them with the rest of the text ( heaven forbid). To be fair to McCall she does state at the beginning of the book that\nher advice is heeded at your own peril. This is a good point. While much of the book states the blindingly obvious 'You'll meet someone when you least expect if and places togo on a first date( restaurant,\ncinema, concert) - other pieces of information are perhaps a little\nmore personal to McCall. I'm quite sure she is alone in using such phrases as' Tommy tod ger still in the toy shop'. One of the earliest points is that when you meet someone you should be yourself, not someone you're not. Fair enough. Although it does somehow make the rest of the book a little pointless. I mean if you're\na paranoid xen oph obe perhaps rules on how long you should wait\nbefore phoning your beloved are not for you. On the plus side, this\nbook doesn't offer any euphemism drenched meaning of life, nor does it present single life after thirty as a love desert.\nIn short almost anyone could have written this book( assuming they'd dated a few times and weren'ta complete stranger to literacy). The simple fact is most of us just didn't. We have other things to do. Complete Prose, Woody Allen\nFor fans of Woody Allen this is a must have. A collection of fifty-two\npieces of writing which is full of Allen's wit and idiosyncratic worldview.\nNot so much a book for reading straight out as for dipping into from time to time. Complete Prose contains some truly laugh out loud moments and all of the stories and plays encompass Allen's particular view of life, society and relationships. For example 'Selections from the Allen Notebooks' which are to be published' posthumously or after his\ndeath, which ever comes first':\nGetting through the night is becoming harder and harder. Last evening, I had the uneasy feeling that some men were trying to break into my room to shampoo me. But why? I kept imagining Is aw shadowy forms, and at 3 A.M. the underwear I had draped over a chair resembled the Kaiser on roller skates. When I finally did fall asleep, I had that same hideous nightmare in which a woodchuck is trying to claim my prize at\na raffle. Despair.\nA classic Woody Allen blend of comedic surrealism and paranoia which runs more or less through all of the pieces in the books. This does make for a truly Woody experience in each piece, but means that reading many at a single sitting can reduce the effect and even start to grate on your nerves somewhat. It is impossible to read these stories without he a ring Allen's voice and delivery in your head, and it would be a very different and perhaps diminished experience for someone unfamiliar with\nAllen's film work.\nWoody takes aim at his standard targets of love, sex, marriage and fidelity, and also looks at western thought and philosophy as seen by a neurotic New York Jew. Rife with literary references, familiarity with Faust\nand the works of Franz Kafka is advisable, although by no means necessary. Really a pleasure to read and your parents will appreciate it too. \u2022 Katherine Russell\nFelix Recommends\nRemember that the two reviewed titles are available from the Waterstone's on campus at a discount of 2 0 % .\nTake advantage of this offer Monday to Friday 9:00am to 7:00pm and Saturday 1 0:00am to 5:00pm.

    "content": "10 Feedback Felix \u2022 22 November 1999\nPoi nt\nAs I have said before, sport is\nextremely important to students.\nAnd rightly so, since it allows the\nparticipant to develop both physically and mentally during their time\nhere. It fosters community spirit\n(\"the ability to work in a team\" is\nsomething which prospective employers increasingly look for in\napplicants CVs) and it's a great\nexcuse to keep the bar profits\nrolling.\nSo, given the importance of such activities, can we at IC claim to provide an environment under which sporting excellence is\nallowed to flourish? Well, in one area at least. The IC Boat Club repeatedly proves itself the better of\nboth Oxford and Cambridge( and,\nby the way, we don't have to bribe\nsteroid-filled Americans to come here and row for us). Our rowers\ngain gold on the water - and in the\nexam hall - on their own merits.\nDon't get me wrong, our other\nsports clubs do we ii enough within\nUL leagues, but that Boat Club\" edge\" just isn't there. But wait - I hear you cry - our other sports\nclubs don't have the benefit of professional training facilities such as\nthe Putney Boat House, nor Olympic standard coaches such as\nBill Mason. Exactly. Which is why\nIam surprised that nobody has\never asked \"why not?\". I 'll tell you why not. The true\npicture is that ICU, in reality, has\nvery little control over the Boat Club. In fact, it only provides roughly 5 0 % of its funding. The real force driving up standards on the river is Frank Murray, IC's professional Sport & Leisure Manager. Since his arrival at IC five-odd\nyears ago, Frank has revolutionised\nthe boat club, spearheaded major projects and set about upgrading sports facilities general ly. The boat club's poorer relatives\nat ICU, whilst not getting a bad deal by anyone' s measure, simply\ndo not have this powerful resource\nat their fingertips.\nWhich is why I'm about to suggest something a bit radical. Loughborough University is\nrenowned for the excellence of its\nsports teams. This is made possible\nby the university's direct funding of\nan Athletics Union, distinct from the Students Union: a similar pos i tion to the one enjoyed by IC boat\nclub. Free from the shackles of petty student politics, teams can get on and train with top-class\nfacilities and top-class resources.\nSurprise surprise, they win. Habit u ally.\nIn a world where more and more new universities are tempting\nstudents to their hallowed portals\nwith bigger and better facilities, IC\nneeds to recognise that more and more people will expect similar\njuicy morsels for their \u00a3 1 0 0 0 p.a. membership fee.\nPerhaps it's time for ICU to\nadmit defeat. For years it has known that Frank Murray has the\nmeans to make sport better for all\nat Imperial. In short, it is time to let\nthe professionals do their job, and establish an Athletics Union, with\nan elected student as its president\n(and Frank as its manager) to rehabilitate sporting life here at IC.\nPRESIDENT PREPARED\nAs reported on last week's front page of Felix, the\nC&G \"Raiders of the Lost Bus\" trip to Brighton and its associated antics did not go exactly to plan.\nUnfortunately, too many people knew about the\nplot to kidnap UL U President Matt Butt, and the\nteam's attempts were foiled. One of those who thought she was in the know was our very own\nsupremo, Natasha. However by the time news of\nthe plot had reached her presidential suite, details\nof the scam had become rather sketchy. On hearing that a squad was going to attempt to kidnap\n'the president' and take them to Brighton, Natasha jumped to the erroneous conclusion she\nwas the target. Kevin can confirm that to avoid\nbeing caught unprepared, on the morning of the\nBrighton Run she was up, dressed, and ready to\nbe snatched before 6 am. Kevin hears Natasha was actually looking forward to a nice relaxing\nday at the seaside, and was thoroughly di sap pointed when the squad failed to turn up.\nMONEY MONEY MONEY\nAt the latest ICU Council the re was a lot of talk on the subject of fines, bans, and other punitive\npenalties that could really get on your nerves\nshould you or your club find themselves on the\nreceiving end of them.\nClubs can now be fined or banned from Union Facilities if their paperwork is not up to scratch. In\naddition the maximum fine and charge that can be imposed on a student by the disciplinary committee has been reviewed and increased: the fine\nhas gone from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 and the charge\nfrom \u00a31 0 0 to \u00a3500. Still on the topic of fines, the\nquestion of where money raised by fines should\ngo was discussed. It was asked if this was a particularly important point to consider, as surely the\namount of money raised by fines should be very\nlow, as it has been in previous years. Natasha immediately enthusiastically responded: \"Say if a Mish\nMash\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nwhole rugby team came in ... and they were fined\nfifty quid ahead, you could make a fortune.\"\nERICSSON EXCUSES\nKevin is not happy with the present state of the\nEricsson deal. When Kevin first heard of the deal, he saw it as a fantastic opportunity to get brilliant,\naffordable communications for IC students. As a non-apathetic student, Kevin made his opinions\nknown to the student representative dealing with\nEricsson, as well as writing them in his column( come.to/mishmash to read all Kevin's previous\ncolumns). It is still not too late to resolve the situ-ation. Ericsson stand to make a huge amount of\nmoney from IC in the long term, and will not be\nput off by a few reasonable requests from stu-dents. Kevin hopes that ICU will not support a proposal which is significantly less impressive than\nthat which we should be able to demand. The latest is that although \"Internal calls will be free,\nshort codes will not be in the same way they are\nnot at the moment\". Kevin had assumed that\nthings could only get better, even he will be\namazed if Ericsson proves to be worse than ACC. WOW\nThe new Rector, who is presently remaining\nin nominate, has been selected. Kevin can confirm\nthat when their name is announced, reaction will\nbe one one of: \" Wow\". Kevin has also learnt that\nthe new Rector's wife has already been shown\nround the magnificent rector i al residence at 1 7 0\nQueens Gate, and has said she: \" Quite likes it.\"\nThe Director of Estates was rather disappointed at\nthis comment. Any plans he may have had to sell\nthe architecturally outstanding house he has\nrecently described as \" a nice piece of real estate\"\nwill almost certainly have to be put on hold.\nTo comment or contribute:\nhttp://come.to/mishmash\nor email mishmash@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

The former ICU President, currently in his final year of Joint\nMaths and Computing, has\nformed an odd alliance with the email service Fun mail. His love of\nJames Bond and his appreciation of the free web based email service has led him to change his\nname by deed poll to james@007. co. uk. The move is attracting\ninterest from national press and a photoshoot for one national paper is already being arranged. The rising star commented,\" Ha ving been President of Imperial\nCollege there is only one thing left\nto do become the coolest man in\nthe world!\" Fun mail allows users to have\nup to 2 0 personalised email addresses using domain names, for example there was a popular response to their last En gal nd Scotland releases where addresses such as name@ lionheart. co. uk and name@ braveheart. co. uk were available.

He felt the\nservice, which is \" particularly popular amongst students\", mixed a unique stylish humour with sound technological service \" The under lying system is the most robust on\nthe market.\" New releases currently being planned include those for\nHanukkah, Christmas and the Millennium. In Brief\nCAMBRIDGE INITIATE\nNEW LINK-UP WITH MIT\nA partnership agreement between\nCambridge University and the\nMassachusetts Institute of Techno logy has been hailed by the govern ment as a\" path breaking in nova tion\" which will form the basis for\nthe future of global higher e duca tion.\nDetails of the final project are\nstill sketchy, as the deal has so far\nonly received approval from both\nsides in terms of broad principles,\nbut it is already known that the\n\" CM I\" will have funding of at least\n\u00a384 million. Of this, \u00a368 million\nwill come from the Treasury'sCa pital Modernisation Fund, whilst the\nremainder emanates from industry\ndonations. The CM I will have four broad areas of activity: integrated research; professional practice programmes in innovation and entre-pre n eur ship: undergraduate education; and the creation of a National Competitiveness Network.\nMED SCHOOLS ACT TO\nEND DISCRIMINATION\nMedical schools across the country\nare acting to counter recent\nresearch which suggests that there\nis an unwitting bias towards women and whites. According to the\nresearch, conducted by Notting ham's Professor David James, most\nof the discrimination occurs at the\napplication stage, and consequent ly it's applications procedures that\nare under review. Although qualifications are not an issue, Prof James believes that asking people to list\nactivities that demonstrate their\ngood qualities (em pathi sing, time\nmanagement, team working, priori-ti sing, caring etc) is the problem, as\nwomen and whites tend to get\ninvolved in more extracurricular\nactivities.\nAs a result, this year Nottingham has asked its applicants to\ndetail experiences from their lives,\nrather than just listing activities.\nOther medical schools are devising\naction plans, encouraged by the\nCouncil of Heads of Medical Schools, and will be watching the\nresults of Nottingham' s changes with interest.\n\" BEACON\" STATUS OFFERED\nTO TOP UNIVERSITIES\nThe Quality Assurance Agency has\nredrafted it's plans for assessing\nuniversities once again. Vic e Chancellors have been given just over\nthree weeks to respond to a proposed framework that will band universities into three categories,\n\" excellent\",\" approved\" and \"not\napproved\" according to the quality\nof their teaching. Under the government's preferred system of\n\" name and shame\", universities\nwhich receive excellence awards will be conferred \" beacon\" status.\nThe paper goes on to suggest that\ncontinued excellence \" could properly be regarded as a beacon that\nothers should emulate\". These plans are designed to provide a compromise between Vic e Chancellors and the Government, but\nmixed feedback to the proposals suggests that it could be some time\nyet before a new quality control\nand audit system is finally agreed. MASSIVE NEW FUNDING FOR BIOTECH CENTRES\nThe government is set to announce a programme to pump millions of\npounds into biotechnology research. The funds will be available to help key institutions coord i nate the growth of high-tech \" clusters\", as recommended in a report\ncommissioned by science minister\nLord Sainsbury. University spin-off\ncompanies could also be big winners, with hefty government bac king on offer. Prime targets for initial\nfunding would appear to be\nOxford, Manchester, Surrey, Cam bridge, Dundee and Cardiff.\n\n"

Only when the\nclub night is as good as this one. Not that I have many less than brilliant nights at clubs. Thinking about it though, there is good reason for this...\nThe clubs I usually go to are\nones that make an effort to\nimpress the c lubbers, rather than\nthose strange clubs that seem to\njust want to be cool. And those\nclubs usually fail anyway. Kno wing Bedrock well then, after having been a number of times, I knew before the night even started that it was going to be more than brilliant. Every detail of the\nnight was perfect - the beer, the\nvodka, the venue, the tunes, the\ndancing... Dancing at Bedrock is perhaps one of the most easily accessible dances for anyone. Rather than\nhaving to try to dance all you have to do is turn up and let the\nmusic take over. Uplifting tunes\nare aplenty at this venue and that's why this is perhaps the best\nclub night I 've ever been to. Going back next month is there fore something I have to do and although the experience has\ngiven me a block on my writing\nstyle, this will never stop me going. Super venue, super club; Bedrock kicks arse.\nGet you the message? You should do, so don't mess up! James Hippies Use Side Door @ The End\nall this scratching is making me itch!\nFriday night saw me (Tom) and Dave heading to that prestigious\nvenue, The End. Normally, the high price and long queues would put us off, but not tonight, ohno, for we were on The\nGuest List. Not that would apply to most of you reading this, but\nit makes things that much sweeter to be ushered in like a VIP.\nWall of Sound rarely fails to impress and tonight was no ex c ep tion. In The Bad Magic bar DJ Mighty Mi couldn't make it, so\nwas replaced by Prime Cuts from the Scratch Perverts. This man does wonders with two turntables, and his mixing and scratch ing were textbook. The choice of tracks was a little bit lacking however, and it left me thirsting for something a bit more. In the Main Room, DJ Touch e from the Wise guys delivered that\nbit more... and even more and more! Flawless mixing of choice big beat whipped the crowd into a frenzy. He even dropped in\nsome of his own tracks. When Ooh La La came on as the\npenultimate track, faces all around lit up. I thought I'd hear that\nsong to death, but hearing it echo around the basement caverns with a beat so thunderous even Thor would be jealous, I couldn't help losing it. If The End was a rocket, then DJ Touch e put it into space. The sound system at The End is great. It real ly knocks you off your feet without making your ears bleed too much. Unfortunately, the star of the show, Dimitri from Paris wasn't there. I haven't got a clue who his replacement was, but he was\npretty poor, sticking to generic deep house with not much to\nkeep you interested. If we want that, we'll go to the Ministry!\nBack in the Bad Magic bar, DJ Greenpeace was spinning the\ngreatest breaks around. This man knows his so u!, and there\nwas a never a lack of inspiration from his voluminous record box. This was the perfect uptempo but chilled end to the\nevening. Our rocket is now orbiting round Mars, and I think it's going to stay there. Until next Friday, of course. This night confirmed my opinion that The End is one of the best\nclubs in London. Getting Prime Cuts as a replacement just\nshows the sort of power they have. The place is open until 5 am as well, making sure that you always get your money's worth, even for the \u00a31 0 it normally costs to get in. Recommended! Tom\nRecommended\nClubbing\nClubs, Trios, Taxi bars and those funny Munch mallow things. We all know that a Club is the\nbest option, so if you can - get down. Monday 22th November; \u00a38\nFree Saptal Ram Benefit @ The Scala; \u00a38\nLoads of names of the bill here to try and raise\nawareness of the 'Free Saptal Ram' issue.\nThere's DJs from Asian Dub Foundation, Primal\nScream and Massive Attack to name but a few,\nand on top of this we'll get Irvine Welsh and\nHoward Marks on the mic. This has got to be\nmore than good. Tuesday 23th November\nTuesdays @ Le Scandale; \u00a35\nYes, it's Tuesday again and time to convert an\nunsuspecting club just off Oxford Street into an\nextension of the union.\nThursday 25th November\nHighrise @ Home; \u00a35\nHighrise is slowly becoming the night home is\nknown for. This may have something to do with\nFriday and Saturday nights at the venue getting\na cheesy and expensive badge compared with\nHighrise's bargain \u00a35 entrance fee.\nFriday 26th November\nMove @ The Ministry; \u00a310\nThe Ministry dishes up its usual Friday night\nselection of techno and hard house. To be\nexperienced at least once.\nSaturday 27th November\nFreedom @ Bagleys; \u00a312\nThis week Freedom celebrates the launch of\n'Human Traffic'.

    "content": "22 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Music\nVarious\nBrokedown Palace\n(Mercury)\nA soundtrack album from a Hollywood blockbuster can be\nan exercise in mediocrity. Ho wever this effort, from a film starring Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes, strives to go a bit fur-ther. The film is about two girls\nwho, whilst on holiday in Thailand, get falsely accused of\ndrug smuggling a crime that\ncan deserve the death penalty\nin Bangkok. As such the album is filled with a lot of female vocalists getting emotional over rolling,' ethnic1 beats.\nThese songs mostly annoy with\ntheir sameness and lack of any\nnew ideas. A few tracks do stand out though: Sarah Brightm an adds a gospel twist whilst\nPJ Harvey gives us a more quirky sound. Thankfully, the male contingent\nmake up for the rather ordinary\ntunes supplied by the girls. Two\nexcellent, more upbeat tracks\nby Audio web and Asian Dub Foundation make the album more bearable. Tricky does his\nmumbling stuff with DJ Mug gs but still fails to disappoint. Had a member of the opposite sex\nwritten this it would have per-formed better.\nNot staple listening by any\nmeans but it contains enough tasty morsels to make me come back for seconds.\nfrequency v/\\ The Artist...\nRave Un2 The Joy Fantastic\n(Arista)\nWhen an album by an ageing artist is full of guest appearances including Chuck D, Sheryl Crow, Ani DiFranco and Gwen Stefani (of\nNo Doubt), it's almost certainly down to a lack of original material\nand a need to add 'designer names' to a poor product to increase\nsales (please refer to Tom Jones). He's appeared in both the American Billboard pop and R&B chart every year since 1 9 7 8 and no\ndoubt this impressive record will continue with the singles to be taken from this album. The Press Release states that The Artist ' breaks new ground every\ntime he releases music. Not only as a visionary trailblazer with his\nconstant exploration, but as an innovative trailblazer', but if you'd fallen into a coma for fifteen years and woken up to hear his new\nalbum, you could be forgiven for thinking that you'd just been in a prolonged sleep. This is along way from the coolness and sophistication of Get Off and Cream. Instead Prince has managed to recreate the type of sound that he needed the New Power Generation for.\nRave Un2 The Joy Fantastic is classic Prince. He composed, arranged and produced the album and in anticipation of its release\nGeorge Michael wrote the song Too Funky as a summation of its\nsound. The Artist combines rock guitar ing with nu-funk giving the listener more twangs than a corduroy concert and Phil's seventies d jing put together.\nFrom the first song( that takes the same title as the album) Rave Un2\nthe Joy Fantastic The Artist hits you with a wall of sound, his voice as\npowerful and distinctive as ever. His collaborations are often barely\nnoticeable, relying on his famous cast as backing singers and musicians. An exception to this is his cover of Every Day Is A Winding\nRoad with Sheryl Crow which is nothing short of brilliant. Most mo dern day covers are merely the same song with a different voice( see\nPlacebo's20 th Century Boy). The Artist puts a completely different\ninterpretation on the song though, I didn't even realise it was a cover until he hit the chorus. If you're a Prince fan then this album won't disappoint. For those of\nyou expecting something new though, you'll find a return to the roots\nnever did anyone harm and it has worked in giving The Artist a much needed resurgence of life.\nVarious\nBossa Tres... Jazz\n(Warner)\nThis CD is the result of a JapaneseFrench collaboration producing a fusion\nof Jazz, Latino and Dance. It is over 1 1 0\nminutes of, apparently, \"pure, deep, jazzy\ngrooves\". It is claimed that this project \"is\nan ode to ecstatic diversity, richness and open minded values, a soothing and serene pathway into the new millennium\".\nThis is a mighty big claim to live up to.\nOne would expect that with the mishmash of national cultures and musical\nstyles involved, an exciting, interesting\nand original sound would result. FAT\nCHANCE. It so lacks originality that it\ncould have been produced by any of the\nweaker members of the early nineties\nacid jazz scene. The majority of the tracks\nare just so lifeless and boring: they just\ndon't go anywhere. Now this might be\nbearable if the tracks were short but these\n\"jazz entrepreneurs\" have deemed it necessary for the listening public to endure at\nleast six minutes of repetitive jam before a break. To make matters worse, the beats\nare uninteresting in the extreme.\nNow this is not to say that this CD is totally terrible but if you want something that\nis interesting and listenable then the\nmajority of the tunes just don't cut it. The\nexceptions to this are Cilberto and Candomble, which blends a great eastern\nguitar riff with experimental dithering key-board. In conclusion, this project provides an\nendless stream of musical meandering s that are pleasant enough to the ear but\nafter a few tracks tends to bore.\nThorn Dave Dan B "

Imagine that the Council misreads the certificates, then goes ahead to court - but doesn't tell\nthem. After the case the Council threaten to send in the Bailiffs.

Check out the web site\nfor information on the services provided - www.ad.ic.ac.uk/health c en tre. A recurrent problem is the surprisingly high number of appointments made by patients who then\nchoose, for whatever reason, not to\nattend those appointments - a\" no show\". Current figures from the\nHealth Centre suggest that since\nDecember1998 the amount of time\nlost through\" did not attend\" appointments is approximately equivalent to\na full-time doctor working for eight\nweeks at the Health Centre. This is\nquite a significant amount of time. If\nyou have an appointment and can not make it, cancelling it frees that\ntime up for other patients. There is no cancellation fee, there is no recrimination for calling or emailing them\nneed the exemption certificates\nagain... l phone registry and they\nsay \" one week, standard procedure\". The words' n of*** ing way' sprung to mind and in fact the magic one week was broken after\nsome sharp wrangling. Surely,\nthough, the registry could and should have jumped to attention to\nhelp these guys - it shouldn't take\nthe Union President getting vicious\nto make things happen in an emergency. If the guys had not come to see me, would Registry honestly\nhave let them loose their stuff to the Bailiffs? It appears so... Then imagine that when the\nguys go to Registry they change their tune and say two days but not\ntoday. It is the opinion of the Registry that other students, waiting for standard proof( which you have\nmonths to supply) should take\nprecedent over those facing immediate loss of their belongings. They\nclaim that there maybe people facing Court action in the queue. For the interest of the Registry staff,\nmost people who come to Court will speak to either me, the D PEW or the Union Advisor, and I know of\nand cancelling. That extra 8 weeks\ncan be put to good use towards\nICH C patients, leading to an even\nbetter service. All students and staff\nare potential patients so it is in all our interests.\nGroups operating on campuses.\nUniversity can be a trying time.\nEvery year groups and organisations\ntarget campuses across the country,\nplaying on student's weaknesses to\nencourage them to join in with their\nactivities. IC usually suffers less than\nother colleges in London. However\nstudents need to be vigilant and aware. If a stranger approaches you\non campus offering friendship, support and help as long as you attend\na meeting of their group DO NOT ACCEPT. One meeting may lead to\nanother, pressure maybe applied,\nleading to sustained attendance.\nTheir offers are hollow and sustained\nno cases as urgent as this at present - in fact cases this urgent come up once every 5 years. I asked the\nother Presidents of UL U, some from Colleges of twice the size of IC and they all replied emphatically that\ntheir registries would do all they\ncould to get the certificates done in\na day. All said their college would manage it and some said their\nf or ms usually only take two minutes\nand asked me why we have a queue anyway - good question. Obviously, the Council is to\nblame for the main cock up, and after hours of struggle we got what was needed.

Due to our late afternoon arrival\n(it takes two and a half hours to get there) our match time was reduced from1 hour to40 minutes to try and avoid playing in\ndarkness. This meant last year's scoring rate of a goal per minute was repeated, aided by the fact\nthat they were a player short for the first 1 0 minutes.\nIn lacking a keeper, Sarah, our shooter, had free shots on goal but still managed to take 2 or3 attempts to get them in. However, the presence of a keeper marking her (when she turned up) caused the ball to zip through the net first\ntime from all angles. Combining with Shirley, our other shooter, a flood of goals completely deluged an overwhelmed Wye side.\nAt the defensive end there was\nlittle for Kirstie and Rachel to do we'll overlook that one conceded goal!\" We had to let have one didn't we?\" The attack cleaned up; Dorothy, Paula and Jane snuffed out any attempt at Wye offensive play before it could reach the IC circle. In fact, Paula\nwas so enthusiastic that at one point she knocked the ball out of\nDorothy' s hands. All of us overcame some extremely close mar king during the match Did the Wye players know that they had to be 3 feet away from the opposing players?\nIn the end, we were playing in\nthe dark with Shirley completely disappearing due to the background of conifer hedges at the IC\nend of the court. All you could see was a white T shirt leaping around. Bad luck Wye, we hope that\nthe merger doesn't disrupt our annual fixture.\nIC II 6 0\nLSE III 1 0\nThe IC Seconds made their spectacular debut with a blinding victory against LSE III. With the weather\nnearing Antarctic temperatures, catching the ball at first proved difficult. Fortunately, however, we began to thaw out once our goals started rolling in. Shooters Jess\nand Sara proved to be our unbeatable deadly duo, with 2 0 goals being scored in the last 1 5 minutes. Fantastic play by the whole team and a confident start to the forthcoming season. Volleyball in undefeated season\nMEN\nAfter along summer period sav our ing last year's fantastic performance( BUS A national final),\nthe time has come for IC to start it\nall over again. And what ada un ting task in front of us - from the formidable team of last year,\neverybody' s gone! So we just get another bunch of very good play-ers. With the usual wide ranging collection of foreign imports( from\nTaiwan, Switzerland, Germany, France and Greece), it seems that\nwe have once again managed to put together a great team. Let's see.... \u2022 IC30K CL In our first fixture of the season we played King's College. Big rivalry between the two teams, but in the end a comfortable victory\nfor IC. They just could not handle it. Total superiority.\n\u2022 IC30 QMW\nAgain IC just walked all over the opponents. There was a fright\nat the start though our setter,\nJohn, could not make it to the match and we had noone that\nhad ever played in such an imp or tant position( a bit like when goal keepers get injured and no more subs are allowed, for the football fans out there). So, Er wan stepped in and took the risk. He did a brilliant job, managing to improve as the game went on. But in the end, another solid performance from our boys, under the brilliant captaincy of Beat ( aka Terminator),\nmeant that another London opponent had succumbed to IC power.\nWOMEN Contrary to their male counter parts, over the past few years, the women' steam has not performed at the highest level. However, this\nyear things have changed! We have an outstanding group of players who are playing the game at levels that one expects to see only at the BUS A nationals. All9 girls in the team( coming from France, USA, Switzerland, Spain and Malaysia) are simply top class\nplayers. Unfortunately, three of\nour players will leave after Xmas which will make things ies s easy.\nMeanwhile we'!! goon and destroy London opposition. \u2022 LSE 0-3 IC For the first match of the season, the girls faced LSE. The fee ling was that our team had great\npotential, but being the first fixture\nof the year there was some nerv-o us ness in the air. IC started out in\nfull strength and with some solid setting by Ma gali and Vas so( unfortunately in her on iy appearance of the season) the team pulled an important and moral i sing win over LSE.\n\u2022 KC L13ICA lot of tension in the air, that's for sure. Both teams were\ndetermined to fight for their lives.\nIC started bad three players\narrived late, thus the warm up and initial line-up was not ideal. It was a nail-biting first set and KCL grabbed it by the smallest of mar gins, 2 5 - 2 3 . For the second set,\nchanges were introduced and the late arrivals went in. IC played superbly and clinched this one easily. At this time we though KCL would have realised we were the better team and would let it go, but they dug in and fought hard. Another nail-bitter, but IC came out on top, this time by 2 6 - 2 4 .\nThe last set was a mere formality.\nIC was now in full swing, playing spectacularly and closed the match in convincing fashion. A special mention to An is ah who stayed on the bench for the vast\nmajority of the game, but then\ncame in the last set and was unstoppable, spiking every single\nball. And for Maria Jo who got a small share of the action but n eve r stopped supporting the team. MIXED\n\u2022 QMW 1-3 IC\nThe mixed team plays in the First Division of the UL U league. Having won it two years ago and finished runners up last year, our reputation is high. First match was away at Queen Mary's. As usual, a lot of uncertainty was in the air due to the lack of team training, but confidence was high. The game started well and we clinched the first two sets comfortably. Beat, the stand-in coach, was in a social mood, giving everybody an equal chance of playing. This\nmeant the team was changing all the time and eventually the price\nwas the loss of a set. The opponents' captain was mes meri sed with the play of our girls and at\nthe end of match kept on asking where had we found them. They\nwere impressive indeed! Especial ly Sarah, the captain, who did a magnificent job as a middle play-er, blocking everything they threw\nat her.\n\n"

    "content": "6 Science Felix \u2022 22 November 1999\nWhat is Science? What is logic?\nDo we need them? Science investigates\nThis is Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, and all of you will have taken a science subject at some point, and maybe you're\ndoing science right now. Or are you? Is there\nreally a difference between studying science and carrying out science? Do we really know what science is? Over the next few months I 'll be trying\nto find out more about the science that goes on in this place and what it is about science which makes it such a powerful form of human thought. It's1,500,000BC, and what will one day become downtown Cairo is your home for tonight, a series of caves and shelters. Amongst your many natural enemies you can count cold, disease and the large animals which linger in the dark. But you know about flames. Some times lightning strikes or hot weather bring large fires and with them, heat and light. All the other animals fear it,\nand although you use it to\nyour advantage, you are still\ndependent largely on when these fires come. But one day you notice that a sharp flint makes as park almost like a tiny fire. Could these be tiny fires?\nCould they be used to make fires? You take some small twigs and dry leaves, things you know burn easily. You add as park... Of course, whether our ancestors used reason or a lucky chance to make fire will probably never be known. But look at the method you just\nused. Observation, hypothesis, design experiment, perform experiment, collect results, draw conclusions, learn something new. This is the\nfundamental scientific method, from which every-thing we study here comes. It's been argued in the past that a scientist\nwill know the underlying processes behind a syst em, so it's naive to describe someone so primitive as a scientist. He would know nothing of the\nphysics of aflame or the chemistry of iron, for example, while a true scientist would. However, think for a moment about what science is; the\nstudy and application of acquired knowledge, and the discovery of new knowledge through the\nscientific method. In short, scientific knowledge and scientific reasoning. So a scientist can be a person who thinks scientifically. So whilst our logically minded caveman may not have a white\ncoat yet, you could still consider him to be a scientist. Unfortunately, while we may spend a great \"The next generation\nof scientists must\nbe able to think like\nscientists, or\nscientific reasoning\nstops.\"\ndeal of time here learning and applying scientific knowledge, it's easy to lose sight of scientific\nreasoning. Laboratory work will consist of an edited version of discovery you will learn the\nimportant and correct techniques for working in\na lab, but you will rarely have to come up with a hypothesis and go through the entire process for yourself. Worse still, in the first few years, entire\nexperiments are set out in the script before you, with no requirement to follow a pattern of reasoning to reach your conclusion. Even lectures, which makeup the majority of the course, will\ngenerally consist of relaying facts, while saying little of the reasoning which lead to the discovery of this\nfact.\nSo why is this so imp or tant? Well, scientific knowledge only goes so far, and the next generation of scientists, currently in training, will\nbe expected to use their scientific reasoning to push the\nfrontiers further. They will not be able to do this without being able to think like scientists. They must knowhow to acquire new facts, as well as apply current knowledge other wise scientific progress stops. So why aren't these\nsecond nature to the whole College by now? Probably the only answer is that there's not enough time. Imperial didn't get to where it is by\nturning out graduates who think by pure reason, but don't even know the basics of calculus. How ever, there's time in a three or four year course to\nteach something extra. Maybe our scientists\nwould be able to communicate with a much lar ger section of the public if, instead of a language, the Humanities Department began to revive the\nalmost forgotten ancient skills of logic and rhetoric. Imagine arguing in French without speaking it to a reasonable degree of fluency. Logic gave birth to science and is the basis of the scientific\nmethod, while rhetoric is the highly developed art\nof persuasion and communication. There is an option in Science Communication available, but\nrarely .taken up, while logic is assumed knowledge. In an age where science is considered to\nbe the most developmental force on which progress depends, yet scientists are less able to\ncommunicate with the general public worldwide, surely these should be considered as important as learning a foreign language?

Its Abomination. A mysterious plague has incapacitated the entirety of the present-day\nUSA millions are dead( it would neve r happen in a film - unless it was\nEurope). Responsibility seems to fall (at least in part) on a major cult\nknown as 'The Faithful'. Its mutated followers are doing their best to either recruit (no semblance to real life there then) or kill the saner survivors of the chaos. Enter the player with his secret team of bio engineered Nemesis operatives, and its time togo practice some anti-religious butt-kicking.\nMissions range from wasting all cult missionaries within a particular sector to protecting your own premises. As the game progresses and your knowledge grows new objectives will become apparent. A maximum of4 soldiers can betaken on any mission, putting an emphasis on strategic and stealthy combat if you wish to pullout with your squad still in tact. Being outnumbered is great since it makes it all the more satisfying when you gruesomely take-out 6 cronies with a sneak i ly placed grenade, and then retreat before the enemies lock on to your\nagent. Although real-time, the action can thankfully be paused to allow you to change orders at critical moments without this option the\ngame would be nigh on impossible. Viewed from an isometric perspective one may complain about the lack\nof game area you can see on the screen at any one time. However, the\ndecent graphics pull some attention away from this grievance, as does the extensive environment interactivity with large numbers of cars and weird organic growths available for your want on destruction. Based on a sprites/ prerendered background graphics engine even I could be assured of smooth scrolling and animation on my lowly PI 6 6 with 2 MB V RAM. Turn on the gore and watch those body parts fly! (ahem...)\nBesides trigger experience, some shifting of resources, team manage ment, and missions election are all vital to your cause. Unfortunately however, the depth of such options is shallow compared to the X com series where the player controlled spending and research goals are as important as manufacturing criteria.\nAbomination may not leave you revelling in its wake, but it is a good effort nonetheless and comes highly commended, particularly for gamers without monster PCs. In association with\ngames wire. com\nA WHOLE NEW WORLD\nIndependence War - Defiance (PC)\nIndependence War - Defiance is unlike most space combat simulators in\nthat it doesn't put you in the cockpit of a dinky fighter. Instead you're in\ncharge of a160m long 'Dreadnought' class corvette. The Special Edition\ncomprises the original l War, released two years ago, where you serve in\nthe Commonwealth Navy suppressing Indie insurrection along with the\nnew 1 8 mission Defiance Campaign where the table has been turned and your fight for freedom as an Indie Captain. Kicking off a strong plot is a cracking14 minute intro movie. Earth relies\non its colonies to feed its population but the colonists aren't happy with the\ndeal! The colonists seek justice in an independence war. In game cut scenes build this story further.\nIndependence War's outstanding feature is its Newtonian based flight\nmodel. Flying the Dreadnought is a very different experience to the Fl5's of other games. When the engine's turned off you just keep moving. This\nallows for a variety of manoeuvres unseen elsewhere, such as sideways\nmovement and the ability to flip over 1 8 0 degrees and hammer the enemy on your tail whilst travelling in the original direction. This system is truer\nto life than most games making it interesting and fun to play. If this system isn't your cup of tea, an alternative arcade mode is provided. When the game was originally released a friend of mine mistakenly\nbelieved that l War used his 3Dfx card because of its speed and amazing graphics, not realising that it was unsupported. Only now are the graph ics starting to show their age against the likes of Home wor/d and X Beyond\nthe Frontier and even they aren't that much ahead. Glide support has now been added, so ships look better than ever if you own a3 Dfx card. Ho wever as most people's graphics cards only support Direct3 D they won't be able to see this. The software engine is excellent (though limited to\n6 4 0 x480). In the Defiance campaign there are also some new add it io nal features such as a mid-point mission save, zoom function, collision\nalarm and a weapon load out screen addingto the experience; unfortunately, these haven't been added to the original campaign. Despite a lack of multi-player missions the branching mission structure,\ninvolving plot line and unusual flight model create a unique space-sim\nexperience. If you have the original l War \u00a320 is a lot to pay for the Defia n ce campaign as the 3 DFX upgrade is freely downloadable along with a mission editor. If you didn't get l War and are into space combat games, Independence War sets itself apart from other titles and is well worth loo king at. I keep going back to it.\nViv Tim\n\n"

    "content": "22 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Music\nfrequency\nTalking All That Jazz!\nBemsha @ Notting Hill Arts Club\nAll the jazz fans will understand when I say that we're quite a rare bread. That's why I'm always trying to get others involved and interested. You wouldn't believe how many people can tell you they hate jazz without having listened to any real jazz man. I'm going\nto tell you about a club in Notting Hill which will interest anyone. Go there, and then\nyou'll be able to have your own opinion on jazz.\nThe Notting Hill Arts Club isn't only a jazz club; in fact, it's only home to jazz musicians\non Tuesday nights, but maybe that's why you should try and give it a go. The atmosphere is exactly what you would expect: noisy, lots of drinking, everybody having fun\nchatting up the women whilst listening to some really groovy improvised music; the\nentry price is ridiculous ( \u00a35 after 8pm, free before ), although the drinks inside aren't cheap; but most importantly, the music is great. This club is known as Nathan Haines'\nkingdom, because it's this very talented (and very young!) saxophonist/singer and his\nband who pack the club every Tuesday night. Along with his usual band, he invites DJ's and other musicians to bring you every kind of improvised music from Latin jazz to\nheavy funk through hip-hop, and it always works perfectly.\nThere is another reason why this club is irresistible. It was created to enable young\nartists to bring their talent to the stage, and therefore its regular clients are would-be\nphotographers, designers and... models. Yes, I knew this might just be the best argument to check out the club. The details are below and if you've got a Tuesday night free\nsoon make sure you get down.\nNotting Hill Arts Club\n21 Notting Hill Gate Wl 1\nTuesdays 8pm lam\nFree before 8pm, \u00a35 after.\nAs well as tunes being spun on the decks, I'd also like to mention a couple of live gigs\ncoming up soon. These kind of gigs are more than worth the entrance fee.\n25th November\nScott Hamilton @ Shepperton Jazz Club\nThis American saxophonist has been around for a very long time, and is a regular at\nthe Pizza Express Jazz club. It's the first time I 've see him elsewhere in London. He\nalways delivers superb ballads rather than upbeat music, but that's good from time to\ntime. This one depends on your mood.\n29th and 30th November\nIan Shaw & Claire Martin @ Pizza Express Jazz Club\nThey're performing a brand new show called If It's Magic, supposed to be a celebration\nof the work of Stevie Wonder. This'll be more than great, whether you're a fan of Shaw\n& Martin or not. The other great thing is that it's at Pizza Express so the food will be\npretty good too.\nEffiene\nDeath in Vegas\n@ Shepherds Bush Empire\nDeath in Vegas. Three words, or two really as 'in' does-n't count. Okay then 'Death' and 'Vegas'; two very different words that both conjure up very different things\nin my mind. 'Death' makes me think of people dying\nand how bad it must be, and then for some reason I think about suicide and how stupid it is. Vegas on the\nother hand allows me to think on a much more fun\nlevel. I think of gambling, drink, sex, drugs and all the\nhedonism that goes with the city that is Las Vegas.\nThis is what I was thinking about just before Death in\nVegas played at Shepherd's Bush Empire last week.\nMaybe strange, or maybe not. But as soon as the band\ngraced the stage with Dot Allison, their m esme rising first guest of the night, ail this disappeared as I let the\nmusic take over.\nIf you've heard Death in Vegas's recent Contino Sessions you'll know that their music is quite unique. Lying\nin a trip py no-mans-land between the rock, dance and\nelectronica genres, they possess a style that is perfect\nfor sitting around and having a think to. On the other\nhand it's also perfect music for sitting down, emptying\nyour head of all your worries and just letting the music\nwash through you as you listen to the many intricacies\nof the tunes. Death in Vegas seem to employ more\nmusicians than a small classical orchestra and this\ngives them a meaty stage presence that smaller bands\ncan on iy dream of. Further, the light and graphics\nshow is a feast of a delicious multitude of flavours,\nwhich when summed with the music make one of the\nbest live packages of any of the UK bands of the late\nnineties.\nAll in all, this was a tremendous night. Three of the\nfour guest singers on The Contino Sessions turned up\nto add to the delight of the packed audience, with\nBobby Gillespe giving perhaps the most memorable\nperformance with his wavy dancing and his fresh new\nschoolboy haircut. If you get the chance to go, a Death in Vegas gig is hard to beat, and much better\nthan a night with some of the more famous acts out\nthere. Have a think about it.\nJames\n\n"

Nice.[ ecu s] The lions share of the \u00a3 1 2 0 0 0 0 or so that heads in the direction of the CC Us goes to ICS M Union( something like \u00a3 8 0 0 0 0 this year) to fund club and society activity (which isn't included in the section\nabove). There's also a few thousand pounds for C CU publications (ahem), mascot ry and Exec expenses -note that noone gets any money to sub sid is e social\nevents, so all dinners, balls, shows and discos must\nbreak even .\n[ sabbatical salaries ]\nThis year we have six sabbaticals( four Union officers, the Felix Editor and the Med School President),\nall receiving a salary linked to the standard PhD grant,\nincluding a free hall room as part of the deal. Each one costs approximately \u00a31 3 5 0 0 , so I hope you think\nSABB SALARIES\nyou're getting your money' s worth...\n[ staff salaries ]\nThe Union wouldn't function without a backbone of continuity, based around some damn fine permanent staff. Although the staff who run and man the\n. bars, catering and events are paid for out of trading\nrevenue, the salaries of the remaining full-time and part-time (ie student) staff still makes up the largest\nportion of the funding cake, requiring nigh-on aqua r ter of a million pounds to keep the Union running.[ admin ]\nThe least fun element of any organisation is\nadministration, and as so much of what the Union does is voluntary, it probably looks like it occupies a worrying ly large portion of the funds available. How ever, although much of this section is accounted for by\nthe more mundane items (stationary, travel, de pre ci ation and the like), I 've also lumped things like elections, marketing and welfare provision into the\" admin\" bracket, so at least some of it is actually providing useful services.\n[ miscellaneous ]\nErm...well it's the stuff left over, and to be honest\nI'm not quite sure what's accounted for by that in no cent looking9%. At a guess I suspect that maintaining the minibus fleet and providing for the women's minibus service are in there somewhere, along with\nsimilar fluffy stuff like the day nursery and student\ndevelopment. Very nice, I'm sure.\n.^^^1^\nApr\n\n"

Dear Felix,\nAs the proposer of the \" NUS Demo\" resolution passed by iCU council, I'm pleased to see it stimulating some debate (Breakpoint, Felix\n1 1 5 7 ) . I'm a strong believer in\ndemocracy and believe that such\ndebate is its backbone. Can I therefore suggest to Mr. (Ms?) \"Break-point\" that (s) he submits a paper to\nthe next union council, allowing\nthese concerns to be openly debated\nin a democratic forum?\nGeorge Constantinides\nICU Equal Opportunities Officer\nDear Felix,\nI feel I must reply to the points\nmade in Breakpoint in last weeks\nissue. Whilst broadly supporting Mr or Ms Point's right to remain anonymous, to use this anonymity as a cloak to hide behind, then level a series of in a curate criticisms and veiled insults, seems unfair and cowardly.... The ICU holy grail is to be\napolitical and proud of it. I see nothing to be proud of in standing back\nand doing nothing while student\nhardship is worsening. I see nothing\nto be proud of in apathy and ignorance of the wider situation. Most of\nall, I see nothing to be proud of in\ntaking cynical sideswipes while a hard-working few in the national student movement do their level best to\nchange things for the better. The\nmotion to Council, if BreakPoint had bothered to check out his or her\nfacts, included a clause which\ndeplored \"the career is m rife within\nthe NUS\"; precisely the problem to\nwhich he or she refers.\nIncidentally, one might ask why\nsupporting a demonstration is\nregarded as \"playing in the murky\nworld of politics\" but opposing one, criticising various MPs and government proposals for the Lords isn't?I don't think this is a coherent position;\nit smacks of double standards, but\nthen apathy in the face of cut-backs\nand other denigration s has always\nsuited the right wing.\n....Breakpoint's sniff in ess about\n\" new\" members of council are tantamount to an argument for ensuring\nthe Union is always run by the same old tried and tested hacks...If BreakPoint is unhappy with the democratic\nprocesses of the Union, any suggestions for improvement would be welcome. Life-long elective dictatorship\nfor presidents perhaps?\nFinally, I 'll leave you and BreakPoint - with this thought: the\namount spent on advertising the\ndemonstration is a tiny fraction of the\nannual pewter tankard budget.\nPaddy Hayes\nRIVALRY RELIGHTS\nDear Felix,\nI would like to raise a couple of\nissues about Mr. Ganesarajah's column in Felix last week. Firstly, how does the statement that C&G fresh-ers have an A level points average of\n2 9 , which obviously makes them\nsuperior to all the other fresher s at\nImperial, have any relevance to the\n\" big question\" of what C& GU can do for them? To imply that C&G graduates earn more than other IC\ngraduates purely because of the fact\nthey have an \"industry orientated\"\ndegree is nonsense. I think that the\nmedics may claim quite rightly that\ntheir degree's are actually rather\nmore \"industry related\" than those of\nC&G, since the vast majority of ICS M graduates are actually going to use\ntheir qualification for their job, rather\nthan taking the highly original choice\nof management consultancy. Also, I don't remember junior doctors having a huge choice in starting salary!\nThe fact that the courses in RS M are\nactually designed with industry help\nis obviously not an example of having a lucrative \"industry orientated\"\ndegree, since ARS M is the acknowledged benchmark for excellence\naround the world in the mining and petroleum industries. I would also\nlike to ask; who is the more rounded graduate? Someone from RS MorI C SM who graduates having learnt\nsocial and interpersonal skills by\ngoing to social events whilst studying,\nor the C&G star who has 2 9 UC AS points but has never gone out.\nSurely, the \" big question\" that\nC&G students should be asking is\nhow their exec is still organizing\nevents that fail to improve their social\nand recreational skills, since noone turns up to them, hence the heavy\nlosses. For the President of C& GU to\nsay that he doesn't mind if they waste\ntheir Union resources is inappropriate and not helping his students. If he\nwant's to see a well run event, that\nappeals to students, he could do worse than attend the RS M Christmas Ball. Our Freshers Dinner had nearly 5 0 % of the fresher s attending.\nThe day C& GU manage25%, I 'll\ntake my hat off and say well done. Yours faithfully,\nMatt Cockayne, R SMU President\nMEDICAL DEFENCE\nDear Felix,\nI agree with Ben Jones (not my\nreal name) Medicine4 on the subject\nthat Felix has improved vastly, but the\nidea of Prince Albert is to not be a Felix clone. It is to give the medics\nacross the campuses some lighthearted humour and something alternative to read. You won't find the\nlatest cinema/music/sports reviews\nas in the more formal production of\nFelix; rather a light-hearted and humorous look at life on the various\nmedical campuses, various amusing, random articles ( Do you, Ben Jones,\nown a llama ??) and the jolly capers\nof some of those in the med schools\n(activities of which often do involve\nrude words) !! Whilst Prince Albert\ndoes go over the top sometimes,\nwho cares ?? If you are so sensitive\nas to be insulted by the material in\nPrince Albert, perhaps you should\nleave your copy unopened and give\nit to someone who will appreciate it\nfor what it is (i.e. most of the pop ul ation of the Med Schools !!).\nJames (my real name)\nCor.\nThe deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 1 2 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk. Letters may be edited for length but not grammar or spelling.\n\n"

It's very simple, and very nice.\nIf you' re out to impress that lovely\nlady living on your fourth floor, this\nis the way to do it. You'll need to hogan entire cooker to do it, but it's well worth the effort (trust me,I 've not died of food poisoning yet). You'll need( in metric student\namounts): per person: \u2022 Enough rice to fill 1/2 a plate\n\u2022 2 0 0 g of chicken (cut into\ncubes Sainsburys do some nice stuff cut up for you, you lazy sod).\n\u2022 6 (small) or5( medium) sized\nnew / Charlotte potatoes.\n\u2022 1II onion (medium)\nand also... \u2022 Some Dijon mustard (bottle)\n\u2022 Some honey (jar)\n\u2022 Double cream (small carton)\n\u2022 Tarragon (a spice type thing)\n\u2022 Chives (fresh or freeze dried)\n\u2022 Salt & pepper (of course)\n\u2022 Garlic cloves (1 -2 depending on whether you fancy your chances or not)\nYou'll also need to locate a wok( which your parents bought you when you came here), a saucepan for the rice (ditto) and another saucepan and large frying pan/ wok to do the potatoes. This is\nwhere cooking for a friend (potential or otherwise) might come in\nhandy.\nIf you have no friends, you'll\nneed to borrow( read: steal) some kit from your friendly hall kitchen,\nor your flat mate who doesn't cook anyway and lives out of microwave meal boxes.1. Boil the potatoes( wash\nthem first). They should take about30 mins to cook(25 mins if nice\nand bought from North End Road Market). Add5 mins if needed( if\nthey are too hard), but it should be easy to push a fork through them when they are properly cooked you want them soft but not falling\nto pieces.2. While the potatoes are boiling, you might also want to boil\nthe rice. Rinse first. How long it\ntakes to cook depends on the rice,\nbut if you try some and it doesn't taste \" hard\" then you' re there.\n3. While you' re boiling stuff,\nfinely chop the onion, leaving a quarter of an onion left over.\n4. Fry the onion with the wok on low heat, add the chicken, switch to frying capable heat and cook until the chicken is cooked and looks white.\n5. Add the double cream to the fried chicken. Add a tablespoon of mustard and honey to the sauce per200 g of chicken. Add more to taste, sprinkle in\nsome tarragon, and leave to sim mer. You' re hoping for a lot of the\nmoisture to burn off here, and you should be left with a sauce about the consistency of a good curry\n(not one you bought from the Union).6. Fry some garlic and the rest\nof the onion in a large frying pan, in a little butter.\n7. When the potatoes are cooked, drain and add them to the frying pan. Add some more butter. You' re trying to coat them so they cook better and develop a crunchy exterior.\n8. Cook until the potato skin is\nslightly brown/ golden( de pen ding on the way you cook).9. Remove the potatoes from the frying pan and sprinkle with\nsalt (sea salt is best), pepper, and chopped chives.\n10. Drain the rice (rinse with\nsome boiling water if it looks a little starchy).\n1 1. If the cream sauce hasn't boiled off well enough, add some more mustard and/ or honey. You might also want to add some salt\ndepending on how good your mustard was, and some honey depending on your taste.\n1 2 . Serve with a side salad comprising of lettuce, celery and chopped, very ripe, avocado. If\nyou can find a decent mustard\nbased salad dressing then so much the better, but a nice French\ndressing does just as well.\n1 3 . Eat, accompany your meal with a nice white wine, and enjoy.\n\n"

And they can play\nfootball (apparently) since they beat\nus 9-0 in the league a week ago. But the IC spirit reigned supreme -it's the Wednesday feeling of no lec-ture s, stuff the coursework, play the\ngame and hit the bar( not the wood work). It's in BUS A that we're invincible. Another match, another result,\nanother 3 points well earned (if\nslightly on the fortunate side).\nAn impressive opening from the\nShady Ladies resulted in early goals.\nHedge, Vasso and Frenchie were\nimpenetrable (much to their disappointment) in defence and fed mid fielders Tart, Louise and Girlfriend\nwith great balls to their hearts con tent. Tina showed excellent skill in\nher debut performance. Her long\nball found Jazzy Jeff who dodged the bemused defence and her flashy\ncross found the boot of the talented\nClark Kent. It was10 to us.\nIC were sharp in intercepting the\nwild UCL passes and were quick on the attack. A flick from The Mayor landed in Kent's way, who went on to cruise past UCL's defence and smash one past the helpless goalie.\nOur20 lead relaxed our team, but half-time was a long time co ming (it usually is unfortunately). The break was used well by UCL to\nrecover and think tactics. This was shortly followed by another, debatable, goal definitely offside (we're\nthinking pitch length here) but the ref\nwas too busy looking at Dumb and Dumber' s legs to notice. What had been an entertaining first half quickly turned into scrappy Southampton passing, hopeful Wimbledon style\nlong balls, and the sort of finishing\nNewcastle would be proud to ex hi b it. A couple of (tactical?) substitutions later, and the ball once more\nfound it's way into the UCL half -over and over again. Images of the\nfirst half (bails flying at us, but not\nbeing able to put them away) haunted us each time the ball flew into\ntheir penalty area. Spurred on by\nMae and Hard Kaur's persistence,\nKent turned on a defender and the\npressure was too much. The UCL player obviously wanted to be on the\nwinning side and aided in the 3-2\nvictor/. An own goal, a miracle, and the sweet sound of the full-time whistle has never been so appreciated.\nG'n' T, once again, saved the day with superb saves. She's just too good. Imperial find window to victory\nRugby - Sponsored by A ALT RAN University of East Anglia I5 IC I43 Unfazed by the wind and rain we found when we arrived, we warmed up in the changing room. This was a must win game and the boys came out really fired up. The forwards in\nparticular had a great game with\nCharlie C unwell and Jon Bound leading the charge. After some great\nruc king Dune Rainey crossed in the\ncorner for the first try. We got lazy\nearly on and they scored a dull try.\nThis spurred the boys into action and a try from Dave Gay and two from\nJames Philip condemned UEA to the\nshark tank. We hot-wired their tra c tors, foiled the cunning female assassins and showed them our golden eye.\nUEA II 1 0\nIC II 17\nAfter a sadistically early start in\nSouth Kensington we arrived in a land of no electricity, heating or sun\nshine. We were quickly changed and raring to go. That was until the\nweather set in ...but in the true spirit of IC Rugby we braved the sleet\nand hail.\nAlthough the weather was still\nbitterly cold at kick-off, the troops\nwere fired up and read to go. The first quarter was highly uneventful,\nwith the conditions hampering the\nefforts of both sides, but midway\nthrough the first half the IC brilliance\nbegan to shine through and, after a beautiful passage of play, a quick\nshimmy by Nick Parker broke the\ndeadlock with a try in the corner. At this point the opposition began to\nwise up and despite continuous\nhammering from the likes of Matt,\nMo and Rick, play stagnated until\nearly in the second half. The fresh\npair of legs securely attached to Tim \"hello boys\" Denyer charged their\nway towards the line bringing the\nscore up to 1 0 - 0 . Spurred on, the\nseconds rallied and came back with\nthe taste for blood, beating the\ndefence into submission and leading\nto yet another try for the Londoners\nfrom Jim, easily converted by Tez.\nIC seemed untouchable, but in\nthe final minutes of the game the\nlads from Norwich managed to push through twice and score on both occasions, but it was a case of\ntoo little too late.\nSCOREBOARD FOOTBALL( Mens)\nIC 2 nd XI 4 - 0 Q MW IC 7th XI 5 - 1 SOP FOOTBALL( Womens)\nIC XI 3 - 2 UCL HOCKEY( Mens)\nIC 2 nd XI 0 - 1 UCL ICS M32R HUL NETBALL IC 1st VII lots - less Wye IC 2 nd VII 6 0 - 1 0 LSE\nRUGBY( Mens)\nIC 1 st XI 4 3 - 5 UEA IC 2 nd XI 1 7 - 1 0 UEA IC 3 rd XI\nSQUASH IC 2 nd41 LSE\nSORRY - NO OTHER\nRESULTS AVAILABLE\nDUE TO TECHNICAL\nPROBLEMS BEYOND\nOUR CONTROL\n\n"

    "content": "22 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Clubs & Societies 33\nOutdoor Club\nSTEVE JOLLY\nA\" Wild Weekend in Wales\" was promised, and exceeded all expectations. After a leisurely drive up and a nun feasibly early\ncooked breakfast, Tryfan ( 9 1 5 m) was attacked from all directions except up. Various fogies led the way with some nifty climbing, Antoine giving a particularly impressive demonstration of technical skill by rolling a fag in high winds at3000 feet. Nasty weather provided wet rocks and bonus green slime at no extra charge while preventing the( allegedly)\namazing views from distracting attention from the slippery rock.\nSnowdon was just as wet, but some patient scrambling was well\nworth it, as once above the clouds the view was amazing; the knife\nedge of the horseshoe ridge sticking through the blanket of fog like\nsomething randomly poetic. The low level cloud was concentrated around the mountains, and it was possible to see for miles.\nAs per normal, incredible quantities of top food( and alcohol, for once) were provided on Saturday night by our Catering and Pudding Officers; consequently the night was punctuated by the moans, groans and stumbling s of overindulged club members, and by the explosive sound of Steve supplying his fellow sleepers with a generous helping of ch under.( Also at no extra\ncharge.) Sunday saw the club's attentions shift to the Snowdon area; several members strolled round the famous Horseshoe( back wards), while others went off for some roped scrambling. The Chasm Face sounded interesting,\nand in fact was.

Armed with the power to arrest any\nmilitary person - whatever the rank -anywhere\nin the world, Brenner is determined to solve\nthe crime, no matter where his pursuit leads,\neven if the clues point to his hero, General \"Fighting Joe\" Campbell( James Campbell). Campbell's daughter was the pride of Fort\nMac Callum, a poster girl for the military -beautiful, smart, a superior officer. When she is found bound and dead in the middle of a training field, the authorities fear the worst\nand team Brenner with another CID veteran,\nSara Sunhill ( Madeline Stowe).\nEntrapment is about' Mac' Mac Dougal( Sean\nConnery), who has a nun tarnished reputation\nas the world's greatest art thief. So when a priceless Rembrandt is stolen in New York, the\nevidence points to Mac. Insurance investigator Virginia (Gin) Baker( Catherine ZetaJones) persuades her boss, whose company will lose $ 2 4 million on the theft, to let her go after the master criminal. G in gets more than\nshe bargained for when she meets Mac. Eyes Wide Shut is the last work by Stanley\nKrubrick and stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. If you haven't heard the hype about this\nfilm already then what planet are you on! The stars play man and wife and the film is about their marriage. Definately worth watching.\nThe cinema will be having their Christmas party during the last week of term. Watch this\nspace for more info!\nThe Prince of Egypt: Out to Rent or Buy 22/1 1/99\nBased on the Biblical story of Moses, The Prince of Egypt\nis an animate d caper by Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks Pictures in their latest attempt to dethrone Disney. By targeting adults as well as children the material is both serious and fun; and also offers great attention to detail. With\na cast including Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jeff\nGoldblum, it just can't be missed. The animation is brilliant, particularly the unleashing of the ten plagues. The only weakness is the soundtrack. The songs just don't click\nin the same way as Disney's. This video release loses\nsome if it's cinematic a we but is still worthwhile viewing.\n(4/5)\nDave\nLife is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella): Out to Rent 2 2 / 1 1 / 9 9\nThis is the story of an Italian Jewish family in the years\nleading up to and including the Second World War. The film is split into two juxtaposed halves. The beginning is a light slapstick, which covers the happy times when waiter\nGuido( Roberto Benigni, who also directs) courts school teacher Dora( Nicoletta Braschi). In comparison the seco nd half is shocking as Guido, Dora and their young son Joshua( Giorgio Cantarini) are taken to prison camps. Guido now uses his tomfoolery to protect his son. It is this\nthat gives it a different perspective to previous holocaust\nfilms. (4/5) \u2022\nKatherine\nShe's All That: Out to Rent 22/1 1/99\nThis is yet another teen movie churned out from Hollywood's production line. What does it offer beyond what's come before? Very little I'm afraid. The most popular guy\non campus, Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.), bets a mate the\nhe can turn the school geek, Laney Bogs (Rachel Leigh\nCook), complete with her big b off in glasses, into the Prom\nQueen. The rest is obvious. Bogs loses the glasses, is suddenly beautiful and Siler falls in love. The problem is you just can't help but get involved although most of the jokes\nfall flat. In the end, it is just an average teen flick with a hip soundtrack and a happy ending. (3/5)\nDave\nThis week Screen has EdTv goodie bags to\ngive away containing all the usual stuff.

    "content": "I Big Issue\nICU\nFelix \u2022 22 November 1999\nDAVID ROBERTS\nImperial College Union what is it? It's that big brick building surrounded by builders, where the bar is, right? Yep, that's the one surely - couple of bars, some really cheesy music, lots of drunk footballers, occasional party, that kind of thing... Sound like your view of the Union? Probably if it isn't then you' ve either been sucked into the murky world of Union politics or you' re one of the few first year's who actually bothered to trek all the way through( and take in) this year's Union Handbook. So, amI going to wheel out the standard Union advert once again? Well, actually, no. Rather than my usual stream of praise and PR, it's probably about time that we looked beneath the surface after all, the College entrusts the residents of the Quad with \u00a3 7 5 0 0 0 0 on your behalf every year, so what are they doing with it all? In simplistic terms, that amounts to \u00a3 7 5 per student head and that's before you take into account other income streams\nincluding an annual trading surplus in excess of\n\u00a3 1 5 0 0 0 0 . So, do you think that you' re getting your75 quids worth? Checkout the opposite page for a thorough breakdown of where your money' s going, and makeup your own mind. First of all, however, I'm going to look at a few of\nthe other accusations which are frequently levelled at ICU...[ democracy vs bureaucracy ]\nThe first impression that most newcomers to the Union( newly elected club officers and the like) get\nis that it's hopelessly embroiled in a level of bureaucracy and faux democracy that would make the\nworld of Dilber t look streamlined. Apart from really\nbad PR, is this view of endless committee meetings( which seem to talk around issues for hours, whilst\nleaving all the real decisions to be made behind the scenes) true? Well, there' s certainly no end of committees attached in some way shape or form to the running of the Union, all with their own impe net r able set of acronyms, customs and rules - however, this is true of student movements as a whole. It'dbe very dangerous to let students with no previous experience and very little training loose with thousands of pounds of taxpayers money or the safety of\nseveral hundred students - that's why most student\nunions make a big play of electing three million undergrads to important sounding positions and then let the permanent staff get on with actually running the place. In this respect, ICU is no different -they' re just less proficient at hiding the particularly boring committees under the carpet( if I actually\nstopped to tell you what the likes of House Commit tee or Student Development Committee actually did, you' dbe asleep before you reached the end of the sentence). The big difference here is that, as we're a bunch of Imperial College students, we're much bigger sticklers for rules and regulations. If the letter\nof the law( or, from time to time, the letter of a fifteen year old book of regulations) says that you can't do something then, goddam it, we're going to\ngoto great pains to make sure that noone does it.\nConsequently, it can be painfully difficult to get cer tain things done, as noone wants to tell you how to\nbend the rules to get around the relevant stumbling block... Oddly, it's the same problem that pervades much of the S her field Admin Monster( except that\nthe Union staff, sabbaticals and staff do at least tend to smile and act in a friendly manner whilst telling\nyou that the answer is are sounding\" no\").On the\nother hand, however, a solid obedience to a fairly\nrigid set of guidelines does mean that, provided everything you want to do lies within those lines, getting things done can be a walk in the park, re qui ring two minutes of your time( and half a dozen sig natures) - just try setting up your own club and you'll\n(hopefully) discover that it's not actually very difficult\nto get your hands on Union money. So, questions of bureaucratic problems aside, is the\nUnion truly democratic? Well, point one, turnout is\nlow. Very low. Last year less than10% of the College actually bothered to vote in the sabbatical elections, whilst some Constituent College Union and De pRep elections saw your representatives elected by a literal handful of people a situation that certainly\ncouldn't be described as democracy in action. But\nwho' s to blame? The oft quoted explanation for the ridiculously low turnout( which, in actual fact, is\ncomparable in percentage terms with many other unions across the country) is that no one's going to\nbother voting if everything seems to be going well. Maybe. More to the point, the seemingly inescapable adherence to an a political stance ensures that elections are never decided on policy,\npersonal politics or affiliations. In all honesty,\nturnout will remain low until there genuinely looks like there'sa difference between the candidates. Last year we saw fourteen candidates stand for sabbatical positions( myself included) and, apart from a couple of more\" extreme\" choices, there was practically nothing to choose between them apart from personality, gender, department and hair colour. And if that's the case, why bother voting at all? Until\nwe get a decent Jeffrey Archer v Ken Livingstone bat-tle, turnout is going to continue to crawl along the floor.\nOn the other side of the coin, however, once a group of officers have been elected they do tend to\nrun things in a( more or less) democratic fashion. Whilst some may attempt to steamroller those around them in an attempt to further their CV or personal agenda, the forced adherence to that com plex committee structure means that getting anything controversial done is damn hard. Noone is\n\n"

The geriatric referee managed to give an indirect free kick inside the box after Brad was brought down. Then when Dave was cruelly cut up and injured by a vicious Q MW player, the referee failed to produce any card. The frustrated IC\nteam had a bit of a barney at half\ntime to clear the air and came out for the second half raring togo. The second half was a transformation IC were fast on the break, and loads of chances started to appear. The first to fi nish was Eni ola with as creamer of a shot from the edge of the box. More fluid attacking moves led to a through ball for Brad, which he clinically finished. Joe and Magic used the wings superbly and Joules' magical balls led to War ren taking the ball down on his\nthigh in the box and finishing with\nhis left foot. By this time IC were in complete control, the defence and Ricky in goal were out stand ing. Before the end there was time for Brad to scramble a goal. A brilliant second half performance by IC II - come on boys, let's boost the next round of BUS A. Random score box England0 Scotland1 Oh dear. Chances of England getting past the first round of Euro 2 0 0 0 ? Not a lot.\nICS MI3R HUL I2 The first half saw the Medics play\ntheir best hockey of the season. However, despite the fantastic open play of the ICS M midfield\nand attack, the deadlock was br oken after 2 0 minutes by a slick set\npiece. Apa cy move by Reilly was terminated illegally, and from the\nensuing short-corner Fish pool finished from6 yards, nutmeg g ing the keeper.\nHowever, Holloway hit back immediately. The Medics concentration lapsed, allowing Holloway to win their first short-corner of the match. It was duly dispatched. But with both Keysell and Reilly playing so well on the left and right flanks respectively, it was only\na matter of time before ICS M retook the lead. This time a break\nby Keysell found Meyer free on the\ncentre-spot, and he finished with\naplomb. With half time approach ing the game seemed set for Holloway to be massacred, but a freak goal on the stroke of halftime prevented that. Sanjay made a break into the D and melted a fantastic shot into the keeper.\nHowever, the rebound from the\nfortuitous save found a panicky Holloway defender who belted the\nball clear in defensive des per a tion. However, the clearance travelled a full 8 0 yards to the opposition centre forward, who found himself bereft of Sanjay, his mark er. He finished easily past the\nmarooned Petter.\nThe second half saw Holloway emerge with more rum bus tio us intent. But Meyer, receiving the\nball in a dead position by the by-line, eluded three defenders Kanuesquely, before finding Keysell in\nspace to score the winning goal. IN BRIEF\nSquash\nCross Country\nImperial College CrossCountry Club are pleased to announce the\nengagement of Daisy Boy and Sticky Sarah. They celebrated their\nannouncement with 21 st and28 th place and we wish them all the\nbest for the future.\nDon't ask why, but the race at\nWimbledon Common was our home match and so we had the\nprivilege of starting the race, with\nUCL stuck in traffic.\nThe race was cold. Very cold. It was business as usual forD or chi e, winning her second successive race, and Louise, back in\nthe top ten.\nStan-Ron left his secret lover at\nhome and was4 th. XXX-Gaffer\nwas 7 th and the veteran of the race was next home in12 th. Frank, Stereo Dan and Daisy Boy closed the first team in 1 9 th,20 th and21 st.\nAngus\" I didn't goto La Scand ale last night\" improved48 places to55 th. Well done. That\nwould have taken most of us into\nnegative positions!\nIC II 4\nLSE II 1\nAfter losing their previous two leaguematches the IC second team found itself under intense\npressure to go to LSE and bring\nback a result which w oui d keep\ntheir BUS A Cup campaign alive.\nFirst up to play were Paui (on\nhis debut) and Eric. Paul opened his account for the 2 nds with a highly impressive 3-0 victory and gave the team a crucial head start.\nWhilst on the other court Eric, who held his nerve magnificently through a nail biting finish, managed to secure a32 victory to extend our lead even further. The team then suffered it's only loss.\nSteve battled hard but was unable to avoid complete humiliation in a match that lasted just under seven teen minutes. Nonetheless, LSE's recovery proved short lived as Jeffrey promptly won the next match\nin three straight games, confirming\nvictory for IC and making f he last\nremaining match a formality.\nFootball\nIC VII 5\nSOP II 1\nAfter a run of rather poor results,\nIC VII were determined to rack up a good score against SOP II. After\na stirring team talk by the g uv nar, IC started very strongly and managed to trip over his boot laces and fall into the net holding the ball!\nWe created chance after chance, with captain Jamil rattling the post\nwith a snap shot, but we still finished the first half only 2-0 up. SOP II came back strongly in\nthe 2 nd half and created a couple of chances, but IC kept pushing\nforward, and mid-way through the\nhalf Chris scored with a cross-comes hot, and Mark finished well to make it 4 - 0 . SOP finally\nmanaged to put one in on the\nscramble. The final goal was scored by substitute Pete Cheung from close range. Goalie X au did not have much to do but was outstanding when called on. So a first\nwin and hopefully first of many for IC VII.\nHockey\nic II o UCL II 1\nA terrible performance on a worse\npitch saw the mighty seconds lose.\nBut having won the league we were not concerned and we're still\non our mighty mission to victory -it's just this was a bit of a hiccup.\nWith our star player Bruce Lee\nconfined to the goal because of\nthe absence of the mountain that\nis E. Honda, we were always going to suffer. The result was a poor attempt to beat a team that should\nhave been destroyed by the mighty\nseconds, but we did thrash them\nlast time. And by the way did we mention that we' ve already won the league? We'll try that again shall we.\nThis week, Felix really WILL be at HaH in gt on, so watch out!\nSorry for everything that didn't get in (especially fencing, who I keep forgetting about), but\nthere was no room!

All full-time students are exempt from the tax and only need to\nprovide their local Council with a certificate from their Registry Office. Even\nthough the three students who shared\nthe accommodation had done this,\nthe Council plagued them with\nmonthly calls last year demanding they pay. On each occasion the individuals would explain that the necessary forms had been sent. Their\ndetails would then be checked and apologies made. As the students were not there to\ndefend themselves over the summer,\nthe Council became convinced they\nhad tax dodgers on their hands and the bemused trio were summoned to\ncourt. One of them explained \" We were really stunned.\" They reacted\nquickly, contacting Westminister\nCouncil and once again insisting that\ntheir details had been sent and they\nwere told the necessary information\nhad indeed been received and the\ncase would be dropped. The students were overwhelmed\nwhen they received a letter on14 November informing them the court\ncase had gone ahead, they had been\ntried in absentia and the magistrate\nhad ordered bali ffs to arrive in two\nweeks. The letter was dated 1 1\nNovember leaving them only eleven\ndays to save their possessions. The Council was now insisting on a new\nexemption certificate and the students\nrushed to the Registry office in hope\nof a saviour.\nThey were told they would have\nto wait a week and were frantic when, having explained the desperation of\nthe situation, the reply did not\nchange.. They brought their case to\nICU President Tasha Newton, who felt\nthe Registry's response was \"totally\nunacceptable\" and took the matter to\nthe Deputy Academic Registrar. It was\nagreed the students could collect their\nforms that day, but on arrival they\nwere told they would have to wait\nanother two days. Only after a return\ntrip to Ms. Newton did they receive\nthe papers.\nThe certificates have now been\nsent to the Council, who have promised to confirm that bali ffs will not be sent, and that the students' credit ratings will remain intact. Ms. Newton\nwas dismayed by the Registry office's lack of compassion: \"Their job is to\nhelp people, if they can't do their job\nbecause they can't cope then they are\nsimply not doing their job.\"\nOne student who is looking into\ntaking legal action against Westminister Council for harassment stated\n\"Registry are more interested in their\nown standard procedure and bureaucracy than our needs.\"\nMammoth genetics research lab unites departments\nArtist's impression of the new project\nJIM G EACH& SUNIL RAO\nDespite rumours to the contrary, it\nappears that construction of the new MultiDisciplinary Research Building (MDRB) is well underway and, weather permitting, construction ought to be complete on schedule.\nThe new nine-storey ed building, located behind the Biochemistry\nbuilding, is to house and encourage scientific research projects that are of a multidisciplinary nature, to try\nand encourage better com muni c ation between departments.\nRichard Toy, Major Projects\nManager in College's Estates Divis ion, explained that construction\nhas been put back a week due to problems with digging foundations.\nDaniel Foreman of the Heery Project Management Company, who is\nco-ordinating the work, explained\nthat the Imperial site is very old, and consequently the process has been hampered by underlying debris left\nover from previous structures.\nThe building is apparently still\non budget, though, and construction work is expected to finish by\nJanuary or February, with the bu il ding opening for use by November2000. A few mock-ups of the project were constructed before being\nrejected, but again, that is normal for projects this size.\nRichard Toy and his team are confident that \" the quality of the\nMDR B will surpass that of the award-winning Sir Alexander F le ming building.\" "

Recognise! etc.), and a variety of other equally\nbizarre characters, my trip began outside the Union building at 6 : 0 0\non Friday evening. I had never\nactually been with the I CM Con one of their trips out of London before, despite having been c lim bing with them for two years on artificial walls in London, so I was unsure of how much I was going to enjoy myself. I am,I 'll be the first to admit, a pansy, and have never\nexperienced the (apparent) delights\nof camping and inadequate toilet\nfacilities and I felt as if this was perhaps throwing myself in at the deep end a touch. I 've always been a hotel man myself.\nWe left, and after a fairly\nuneventful journey (which involved\neating the most food I 've ever\neaten in my entire life in some random town), we arrived at the campsite. Surprisingly, it wasn't raining (even though I had checked the weather report: my luck is much more efficient than the Met). It was\ndark, however, which made my attempts at helping to put a tent up much less than useful, but event u ally we were set up and, though cold, we were still dry. For the most\npart. Alex, however, had decided he was going to relieve himself in\nthe traditional male fashion. He could see the bark of the chosen tree reflecting the cool moonlight in\nthe dark (he had no torch), and the\nhy p not ising effect it had on him completely blinded him to the fact\nthat it was in the middle of a stream. He changed, and we ail\nwent to our tents.\nThe next morning brought mostly cold, I remember, but according to the others it was quite\na nice day. I was unconvinced, having always been under the impression that one needs feeling in the\nfingers to climb effectively. I was warned that this was pessimistic,\nand told to stop complaining. So off we went. We drove to The Roaches, which was where were\ngoing to spend our weekend climb ing, and after some wandering and wondering, we dumped our stuff on a big rock, paired up, and went off\nto find things to climb. I 've climbed a lot inside, but nothing could prepare me for the fear of being\nattached to a wall thirty feet up by\ntwo VERY small pieces of metal,\nattempting to belay (hold the rope\nof) someone who was about twenty\nfoot above me.I was afraid. Very\nafraid. But I have to say that getting\nto the top (and some of the intervening period) was very enjoyable. Although I 'll never admit that to my\nclimbing partner ( who mI hold fully\nresponsible for the stains in my trousers). The first day went by without serious incident for us, although the Rescue Services were\ncalled for another group: one of their members had taken a fall.\nThat evening we drank. And I played darts (and lost).\nOur second day dawned, and it was damper, but still not quite\nraining. By this time, however I was\nbeginning to see the cold as my\nfriend (though I 'll probably take\nwarmer, more waterproof clothes\nnext time, so maybe as a friend\nwith halitosis), and thus was in a far\nsuperior mood. We went to a local\ntown for breakfast, and got a bit\nwaylaid, since it now had begun to drizzle and the clouds were very\nlow. We were there, then, at eleven\no' clock, so some of us saw their\nRemembrance Day parade, which\nwarmed the heart of even the cold est cynic (i.e. me). So when we left,\neven though the weather wasn't as good as the previous day, we were\nall ready to do some serious climb ing, and climb we did. However,\nour luck wasn't as good that day,\nand we actually had two injuries\n(more than the usual bleeding hands, which I 've NOW been told\nis standard on grit-stone). One of these, we hope, has been walked off, but the other required more serious attention (due to it being a bump to the back... better safe than\nsorry), so we packed up a little\nearly and trooped to A& E in Stokeon-Trent. The individual in question\nhad relatives nearby, however, so they arrived to relieve us, and we made our way back to London. We stopped again at the same town (if\nyou ever pass through Lutterworth\ngo to the Cottage Chinese Takeaway. Mm mm) where I ate even\nmore than the last time, and soon we were back in the sprawling metropolis of London. Using ac un ning human chain we unpacked the gear from the van in record\ntime, and were all on our way back home before you can say \" How much money, like, would I need, to be aMil lee on air?\" Would Ido it again? Probably.\nWould I recommend it to anyone else? Definitely. It gets you out of\nLondon, and in touch with your fear\nof mortality, and I would certainly\nrate it as one of the most interesting experiences I 've had while at\nIC.\nContact Megan\nmegan.bradley@ic.ac.uk.\nPhoenix\nANDY OFORI\nThe original publication of Imperial\nCollege has returned for f he millennium.

    "content": "22 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Feedback 13\nDear Felix,\nI have just read your Issue 1 1 5 7\nand agree wholeheartedly with\n\" Ben Jones (not my real name)\"'s feedback letter. Felix is read by a lot\nof the Medics not based at the\nSouth Ken. Campus, as it gives us\nall a link with what is going on at\nSouth Ken. Felix is entertaining,\ninformative and readable. However,\nconcerning the comments made about Prince Albert, I was shocked. Prince Albert, and the previous\nmagazines for the Medics, are not\nmeant to insult, offend or disgust\nany reader. They are witty, silly and, alright, sometimes puerile but\neveryone loves them! They area tradition of the Medical Schools and are a light relief from everyday\nwork and toil. The people that write\nfor the magazines are many and unprejudiced. Iam sure that the\nPhysics department have funny\njokes about the Me chEng. department and vice versa. The medics\nhave funny digs at non-medics just\nas the non-medics have funny digs\nat them, they are not meant person ally nor to offend and most medics\nare good friends with the other non medical students at IC.\nYour Faithfully\nKat\n3rd Year Medic Dear Sir,\nThere has recently been an increasing number of letters to Felix\nregarding the treatment of Medics by Felix itself. This must surely be\nwelcomed, as any debate regarding the publication is beneficial to its\ndevelopment. I have but a few\npoints I wish to make: Every newspaper asserts its own individuality and style, this appeals to certain segments in society and allows a niche to develop. How ev er, Felix is supposed to be the news-paper of all of Imperial College, therefore it has the responsibility of\nrepresenting the views of all students in all departments. As such, when inflammatory articles are repeatedly printed about Medics( part of IC, whether anyone likes it\nor not) it is irresponsible of the Felix\nstaff to provide unbalanced op in ions, and state 'facts' that are regularly dubious in their nature. I presume that the students write these\narticles do so because they have at\nleast some interest in reporting, so it\nmakes sense to encourage journalistic integrity by confirming facts\nand writing unbiased pieces.\nThe silliest thing I have read in\nFelix is the editor attempting to\ndefend anonymity of ' MishMash'. He has passed responsibility of this\ncolumn on to its writer, who has\nshirked responsibility by not giving\nhis/her own name. You are al! passing the buck without any of you having the guts to stand by your\nopinions. You do not represent\nImperial College, you represent a bunch of amateur hacks who write\nbadly.\nYours sincerely,\nBill M cCl at chi e2nd Medicine AND FINALLY...\nDear Editor,\nReading your letters page, two\nor three things jumped out at me, and urged me to put finger to key-board: Firstly, Tasha's discussion viz a viz Waterstone's; perhaps I can inform the debate a little by revealing that College awarded the book store contract to the company( and\nnot to ICU, who had reliably been\nrunning the bookstore for years)\nbecause they promised that \" The IC\nWaterstone's will be our Flagship\nAcademic Store\". Yeah, and the\nTitanic was un sinkable. Secondly, Iam sure you have\nheard of couples using College facilities for uses other than those\nintended, as RSMII suggested? I refer of course to John Foster and Annette de Lima, using our prized\nacademic centres as conference\nfacilities above all. I was so honoured to receive my fees invoice\nfrom IC last year in an envelope\nfranked \" CHOOSE IMPERIAL COLLEGE FOR YOUR CONFERENCE\". I also support Tasha Newton110% in her bid to establish an alternative to the NUS.

As this short piece\nseems to be slowly moving from an introduction to Frequency to a full-on column I'd like to take the op port uni ty to continue this pr ogres sion. I moaned last week\nabout people complaining about the music and club\nsections, and as I found putting my opinion across was so\nmuch fun, I'd like to do the\nsame again...... frequency...\nit's weekly\nAlright then - the Millennium, and as the KLF famously said\n- ' What the Fuck is Go in' On?' Well I'm still undecided myself, but when I looked at\nthe date the other day I felt\nmy first worry that I was leaving the decision too late. So what are the options? First of\nall I suppose I could spend\nthe time in a nightclub. Well\nthat's going to be expensive.\nIt's also going to be a nightmare organising my mates to\nbuy some tickets. Another option is just hanging around the London, but if you've ever\nhit Trafalgar Square before\nyou'll know that this is a nightmare of an idea. So what's left? At the moment I'm trying to decide between\nfinding a messy house party\nand working and then s pen ding the money earned on a trip to Amsterdam. However if\nanyone has any better ideas,\nI'd love to hear them. Thanks\nthen, and goodbye. The Longpigs\nMobile Home\n(Epic)\nAfter three years, The Longpigs have finally returned, but the few fans that\nthey once had are now running even thinner. So The Longpigs face the\nimpossible task of trying to sell a great album, with very few head-turning\nsingles, to the masses, without the support of a fan base that similarly-sized bands( the Bluetones, Dod gy and the like) rely upon to boost their\nsales and get themselves noticed again. Because of this, Mobile Home, an album rated as 8 / 1 0 by both NME and The Melody Maker has not\neven made a dent on the top ten-album chart in its first week of release.\nThe Sun Is Often Out, The Longpigs debut album, gave us such near\nclassics as She Said, Lost Myself and the souring On and On, but since\nthen, while touring in the US and battling that second album wall, all con tact with them has evaporated. No public attacks on other bands or the\ngovernment, no outrageous rock and roll incidents, no charity gigs or even aCD: the lack of aUK appearance has erased the name of the\nLongpigs from the public's memory. Even when lead singer Crispin Hunt\nwas bottled recently in a gig by his former drummer, they received less\nspace in the NME than the important news that the Dawn of the Replicants were releasing another ER Just writing good music sadly isn't enough anymore. With a singer as distinctive as Crispin Hunt, it's very hard for an album by\nthe Longpigs not to sound' long pigs y'; Mobile Homes certainly does. You\ncan really tell from the album that their time away has been hard; the\nmusic is very moody. Not a No Surprises moody, that makes you want to\nslam your head in the oven and dream of glue sticks, he's got too much of a point to prove, he's pissed off. Each song has been soaked in the\ngut-wrenching passion Hunt displays in the debut album, with lyrics to\nmatch. The Frank Sonata, the first from the album and the most likely follow up single to Blue Skies is far and away the best song from the album and sees the only true return to a guitar-pop tune. They still have the slow\nlove songs in Baby Blue, their screeching rage in Blue Skies; it is indeed\na well-rounded album. However, like many before the wait has been too long and any hope of a successful return has long been buried.\nSo here's to The Longpigs, may they rest in peace. In their memory, here's some classic lyrics from the new album: 'love like you've never been burnt,\nkiss like your tongue is on fire, suck like you don't need the money, sin\nlike there's nobody judging, cos honey if you tried, I'd come running to\nyou child, like lassies final mile.' Quality.\nDave Various\nMajor Force West 93-97\n(Mo Wax)\nThis isn't your standard 'grab a bunch of\nobscure records, and dump them on aCD' kind of compilation. While many of\nthe tracks are doubtless almost impossible\nto obtain through normal channels in the\nUK, they are all here on merit, rather than\nobscurity. Its difficult to categorise most of\nthe music on this album. Perhaps it's just\nenough to say that it's good. At a push I would say that most of the tracks could be\ndescribed at heavily rewired, beat-led\naural experimentation. Which doesn't really mean anything. It's all got a jazzy feel -pushing back boundaries with fearsome\nbuilding beasts and moog ish weirdness.\nThat there is a track with the moniker \"Here\ncomes the Funky Monkey\" should be\nenough for any Thomas's out there.\nThis isn't mainstream music. If doesn't really have lyrics per se, apart from a few\nscratched out samples and yelps. The\ntunes don't really work as background\nmusic - if you have it on, you listen. There\nis a chilled vibe about this collection, none\nof the artists featured are in any hurry to\nbuild to a crescendo of noise. Most favour\nthe approach which sneaks up on you in its\ncomplexity rather than shocking you outright with chaos and confusion.\nThe most enjoyable thing about listening to\nthis compilation is the way the music takes\nyou on a journey. When those instrumentals have you in their grip, your mind wanders pleasantly, I often found myself visual-ising things to accompany the music,\nwhich is often like a film score in its style.\nLet yourself ease in, and goon a journey to\nthe West.\nID Joel\n\n"

Tricycle Theatre - Kilburn Tube\n\u00a39.50 Cone. Lyric Theatre - Hammersmith Tube\n\u00a3 5 - 1 2 Cone. This is, without doubt, one of the\nmost mind numbing ly tedious pieces of theatre I have ever had the misfortune to see. Tim Fountain's new play unsuccessfully attempts to bring together the writings of Quentin Crisp in a disastrous monologue reminiscent of a nursing home inmate with verbal diarrhoea. This\nplay murders Crisp's work and induces even the most sedate theatre\ngoer to contemplate homicide. The theatre itself, to say the least, is\nless than ergonomic with it's cramped uncomfortable seating you soon find the back of your head nestled nicely in the crotch of the person behind you. Bette Bourne plays the 91 year old Crisp and appears himself to be a budding case for the pro euthanasia campaign. This man shouldn't be let\nout on the street without a psychiatric nurse escort, let alone on the\nstage. The most exciting part of the\nplay was when his wig nearly fell off:\nriveting.\nThe monotonous drool was punctuated with occasional epigrams made completely nonsensical by Bourne' s reliance on the Prompt poor girl, I doubt she has ever worked so hard in her life. If you are tempted to see this play then retire to a darkened room and shoot yourself. Marks out of five - don't make me laugh.\" Who will rid me off this turbulent Priest?\" - said the King; meet\nthe men who did they hacked the ArchBishop to pieces on the\naltar of his cathedral. Thomas a Becket was the Priest, Henry II the King, the four knights the murderers. The people loved Becket and so the\nKnights had to keep a low profile, very low. They lived short of\nfood and heat in a castle in Kn are s bough so the enraged Bec ket supporters did not lynch the m.I guessed that this story had been given a more modern edge when the Knights called Becket a\" complete and utter fuck wit\" and described his murder as\n\"the worst career move in history\"\nThe play explores the effect of such a terrible deed and subsequent isolation. The knights cherish \"Loyalty above all, loyalty\"\nto the King and to each other - but can it stop them from destroying each whilst under the strain of being locked in the\ncastle?\nWe see the degeneration of the knights together and alone for such a time. They get drunk all the time on bad wine and are subject to great bouts of sexual frustration - one of them loves\nthe housemaid, who is in love with one of the other knights,\nwho, in turn, has turned into a mad drunken recluse... Meanwhile, the other two knights used to love each other - very confusing! At one point they become so bored with such utter isolation and as their place within the local community had reached legendary status - that they open the castle to the public and pretend that they are praying all day, only eating bread before bed time.\nIf there is a star in this strong cast it is Johnny Lee Miller, of\nTrainspotting fame, bringing that extra kick that made the play\nreally come to life. Richard Wilson shows what an accomplished theatre man he is as director of this fast moving witty, sharp and daring play. A joy to watch; the Tricycle theatre has done it\nagain. Your four best friends - the lads together-then one of them hangs himself.\nFour characters, using dance, joke telling\nand acting, portray the difficulties facing the\nfour men dealing with this death and its\neffect on their relationships with each other.\nThe performance style is set somewhere\nbetween contemporary dance and more traditional acting. This perhaps means that to\ntruly appreciate the show you need a certain\nknowledge and appreciation of the use of\nmotion and dance in theatre.\nThe production is brave and Frantic A ssem bly (the production company) has had a string of successes and a West End tour\nsince it formed in 1 9 9 4 using this blend of\nthe two arts. The overall effect in hymns produces some very entertaining scenes when\nmotion and sp e ech are used effectively.\nThe acting, however, badly let down the\nmain story, with the portrayal of the main\ncharacters as \" lads\" falling flat. Two of the\nactors were just far too camp to effectively\npull off lad is m may by that's all you can expect from such good dancers! The characters individual mental struggles\ndealing with the loss of one of their crew\nlacked punch. Some of the physical it y of the\ndance went some way to touch the audience but otherwise we were not emotionally\ninvolved. An entertaining show that in its 6 0\nminute performance produces funny scenes\nusing both motion and space, but with no\nreal drama. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Ally pally ID Mo "

It was put to him that ICU is\nnot a part of the NUS, that IC has a large proportion of overseas students and that many of the home students come from affluent background s.He was interested to note\nhow apolitical the Union is, with no particularly vociferous student political organizations under the\nbanner of ICU. He did not seem unduly surprised to find that, unlike\nmany student unions, ICU does not\nhave a Lib Dem society under its\nwings.\nMr Willis was accompanied by\nRobert Browne, the Liberal Demo crat candidate in Thursday's by-election for the Kensington and Chelsea seat, and was met by\nNatasha Newton( ICU President),\nTim Trailor (Deputy PresidentC lub s& Societies), Kevin Butcher\n(Deputy President - Education& Welfare), David Hell ard aka james@007. co. uk( ex-ICU President), Rob Haslehurst ( Academic Affairs Officer City & Guilds College Union). Coincidentally, Michael Portillo, Tory candidate for the Kensington & Chelsea by-election, was seen campaigning around South\nKensington the same morning. Mr Portillo spoke at College last Friday, and Felix hopes to bring a report next week. Careers Fair Flourishes Darwin Development\nGARETH MORGAN Last Wednesday's ICU Careers Fair\nwas a great success, attracting\nalmost fifty of the world'stop g radu ate employers and around two thousand students. There was a wide range of companies, as well as\nthe College Career s Service present.\nFrom high-flying City jobs with\nthe likes of Chase Manhattan Bank\n(winner of f he 'highest quoted starting salary' award at \u00a328,000) and Deloitte Consulting, to more technical careers with Logica or Arup, there was plenty to choose from. The only real problem with the\nevent had been the marquee erected in the middle of Beit Quad. Combined with the building works,\nthis had made access to the Union a problem. As Felix went to press,\nhowever, there had been no reports\nof Wednesday night revellers injuring themselves on the glass doors.\nThe Beit marquee full of prospects Photo: Stephen Hughes\nSUNIL RAO\nEverybody knows about the Nat u ral History Museum rocks, fossils,\ndinosaur skeletons, earthquake exhibits. A big, impressive looking building on Cromwell Road that\nIC students can get into for free,\nthough very few ever do so in the\nyears they spend here, and a great\ntourist attraction.\nWith any museum, there's always lots of activity behind the scenes - not all related to the acquisition and maintenance of objects meant for display or to be kept in the collection and the\nNatural History Museum is no exception. It should come as no surprise therefore to find that the\nMuseum takes part in a fair amount of scientific research, mostly in the field of biodiversity.\nThis research is to be brought to the fore, as plans for a\" new sci-en ce in it at ive\" are unveiled. The Darwin Centre, due to open to the public in the summer of 2 0 0 2 , will allow members of the general public unprecedented access to its research collections, mostly relating to the fields of\nentomology and botany. The Museum currently employs three\nhundred scientists, and the new project will finally bring their work into the limelight. Plans area foot to hold talks and demonstrations from members of the scientific\nstaff, and for live video links into\nthe research labs so that members of the public can actually see and hear for themselves the work being carried out. The \u00a3 1 0 0 million centre will\nalso offer public access to the collections database the Museum maintains, which includes identification guides relating to the nat ural world and conservation. Work is currently being carried\nout on the topics such as acid rain, parasitic wasps and on the\nstudy of diseases ranging from bil-harz i a( schistosomiasis) to on cho cerci as is( river blindness).\nThe Museum currently has partnerships in over sixty countries, in\naddition to the work it carries out here in Britain.\n\n"

Famous for crushing numerous carson tacky late Saturday afternoon TV, they've finally made their\nway to the N64. Monster Trucks, the WWF/ WCW of the driving world, sure have the potential to entertain and their incarnation into Monster Truck Madness\n64 from Take 2 does not disappoint. Take to the mud tracks in one of many different trucks, each sporting original and classy names such as 'The Hitman'... Well at least you can't fault\nthe programmers in their attempts to recreate the whole ethos of monster truck racing. As per usual there is a singleplayer 'circuit' mode where you compete against3 other computer vehicles over10 racetracks, always looking to finish in first place in order to progress. Americans certainly love power over finesse -just look at their Nascar racing compared to our beautiful Fl. In compliance with this,\nthen, you'll find that the handling of the mo nster truck ( although realistically modelled) isn't as easy or sensitive as you might have hoped for, but with practice the anticipation required will become second nature and you'll be able to pull off cracking manoeuvres. Besides driving competency you'll also have to engage in\nsome aggressive tactics and the familiar action of shunting your rival drivers off the track will become routine business. Get knocked about a bit too much or attempt to climb too steep an incline and you'll find your self rolling over. Various power ups litter the tracks that can perform benign acts such as oil-slick deposition to the sexier missile armament or even the transformation of your veh i cle into a flying machine. Graphics and sound have been well catered for although it would have been nice to see the trucks get bust up over time considering all the punishment they take. In exhibition mode you can also change the weather and lighting\nconditions. However, where Monster Truck\nMadness really sparkles is in multi-player\nmode. Unlike many graphically demanding driving games, here up to4 players can bustle for supremacy at once which is just soo ooo much more fun than the normal2. Include the computer if you want and race on a track, or else\ntry out some of the sub games such as tag, summit rumble and soccer( push giant foot balls into goals not as easy as it sounds!). If\nyou're looking for something that doesn't take\nitself too seriously yet still provides endless hours of driving mayhem, this is it.\n\u2022 Viv\nPong (PSX)\nAmI right in saying the original Pong was the first\ngame to use a graphical interface? Maybe. Any way, that game(2 paddles,2 goals, and one bouncing ball) still forms the basis of this latest\nedition.\nI usually approach remakes of classic games with\ntrepidation as they rarely live up to reputation (eg\nSpace Invaders and more recently Rampage\nWorld Tour), since the old concepts can no longer\ncompete in the continuously adv a nc ing (at least\nfrom a technological point of view) gaming world.\nThis version of Pong however completely blasted\naway any such doubt. The game is fantastic - its\namazing how many ways the programmers have\nwangled different games out of one simple concept. Take one snow scene and add to it penguins who,\nwhen hit, give you more balls to cope with. Win this comparatively easy level (by scoring 10 first)\nand you'll have to deal with intruding polar bears\nand shifts in wind direction. Then take football,\ngive each player 2 paddles (one goalie and one\nstriker) and try to score 1 0 goals. Beat this and you'll get molehills, tie and the game will be settled on a penalty shoot-out. The key to the success\nof this game is the realistic physics of the ball. It\nmoves and responds in utter perfection, and this\nfactor coupled with some of the best graphics I have seen for the Playstation mean that you can not but gloat at the eye candy emanating from the\nscreen.\nPong has much in the way of lasting appeal games are short enough to play against the computer or a mate whenever, whatever. In single\nplayer mode you'll need to beat certain levels to\nunlock others ensuring there is always reason to come back for more until every world and every\ngaming arena have been uncovered. All in all,\nPong is a brilliant remake of its forefather, a winning formula which has been given a makeover with enough frilly extras to guarantee that it still\nworks in this modernised world.\n\u2022 \u2022 BH Dv, v "

Of particular note was the Karaoke Barnight\nin Southside, where everyone made a fool of themselves, including the resident gangsta rappers go Se gun. As noted previously, most\nfresher s do not remember the Freshers Dinner, but some people claim they've forgotten it ( Moon y). There was a high turnout, and everyone seemed to be enjoying\nthemselves at the bar later, soon to be regretted by some when the pictures come out( limpet boy, you know who you are). There were\nsome impressive attempts to win the shark hat and beer goggles, not forgetting the ch under bib. To\nsee who the winners are, come along to the U GM at the end of term, when all crimes can be grassed up. Many students also attended\nthe R SMA Annual Dinner, with all30 students being sponsored by\nAssociation members, and had an enjoyable evening, thanks to those\nwho organised it.\nThe next main event to hit the RS M is a week of high spirits, drinking and fun that is Foreign Students\nWeek. For those of you in the dark,2 students from each good mining college in Europe( that's you banned Cam bou me) comet oR SM for a week of revelry and education in RS M traditions that culminates in\nthe Christmas Ball (more about that\nlater). It includes an open top bus trip around London on Monday afternoon, with beer and an RS M tour guide included. On Tuesday\nwe travel down to sunny Cornwall for a trip to the China Clay Works, and a pub crawl around Dartmoor organised by a member of staff\nwith intimate knowledge of the area. We return on Thursday to the\nRS Mbar for our foreign students\nbar night, with free beer and yards\non offer.\nThe weekend begins with the\narrival of 4 0 Dutch lads from Delft\nunder the pretence of a rugby\nmatch on Saturday 4th December.

    "content": "22 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Films 25\nHow much do you value your privacy? Do you have any skeletons in your closet that you don't want people to find out? How would you feel if your life was\ntelevised to over a100 million people 2 4 hours a day, 7 days a week? Well,\nRon Howard thrusts these questions upon Ed Pekurny in his new movie, EDfv.\nLast year we got The Truman Show dealing with the crisis of a man who does\nnot know that his life is being televised to the rest of the world. The story deals\nwith a cable company who, in a desperate attempt to improve their ratings,\nemploy a31 year-old video store clerk, Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey). They want Ed to allow his life and his interactions with the rest of his family and friends to be televised 2 4 hours a day, 7 days a week for a certain length of\ntime. He agrees under pressure from his brother Ray (Woody Harrelson) and then, unknowingly proceeds to wreak havoc on his family and friends by\nattracting unwanted attention to them.\nThe big difference between The Truman Show and EDfv is that in The Truman\nShow, the main character was being filmed without his consent, while in EDtv\nthe character is being filmed out of his own choice. Now would anyone really want to do that? To awaken in the morning to two cameras directed toward\nyour face or to go to bathroom with a cameraman waiting outside to catch\nyou as soon as you walk out the door. Apparently some people are willing to\ndo this! Provided that you can believe this point, then the movie is a generally\nenjoyable one where you don't have to think too much. It's very obvious that\nRon Howard is trying to make a point about the rapidly deteriorating A meri can media culture (to go along with our British one), but perhaps he should\nfirst look closer at people who are willing to make a mockery of their lives and those of their friends and family in a desperate attempt to attract attention to\nthemselves. As one character says, \"People used to be considered famous for\nbeing special. Now they're just considered special for being famous.\"\nThe acting is fine by everyone in the cast. The acting by Woody Harrelson as\nthe brother, Ray and Martin Landau as the stepfather, Al really stands out. Landau is absolutely hilarious in each scene he's in and Woody Harrelson continues to provide fine supporting comic turns. And Rob Reiner, director of films\nsuch as A Few Good Men and This Is Spinal Tap, plays the head Studio Executive.\nWhen this movie was released in America it was unfairly compared with The\nTruman Show and consequently suffered at the box office. While they have the\nsame basic idea, The Truman Show was more original and, to me, superior to\nEDtv, which seems like an extended sitcom. However, they are still different\nmovies that should be judged separately - and the movie provides an enjoyable night out. Just as long as you're not being followed by cameramen.... One simple word applies to this film, which can be repeated an arbitrary num ber of times at your leisure: \"Why?\" Upon hearing of Carrie 2 - The Rage, this\nis probably the same question that fans of Carrie, the 1 9 7 6 Brian De Palma\nclassic, may also be asking. Twenty years after the first film, we are re-intro-duce d to high school life in the US. The first film made a huge contribution to\nstarting audiences' obsession with adolescent issues and was seen by many to\nbe incredibly effective, with both its emotional themes and its offbeat, slightly\ndisturbing visuals.\nThe sequel, like the original, has a lead heroine armed with the power of\ntelekinesis. In spite of her suspicious similarity to the original Carrie (who was\nwondrously acted by Oscar-nominated Sissy Spacek), there are a few differ-enc es.Her name isn't Carrie, it's Rachel, and she isn'ta naive, vulnerable\npubescent unaware of her secret talents. Rachel (Emily Bergl) is an angry Goth, and she knows all too well of her ability to fling objects using the power of her\nmind.\nThe overall premise is almost identical to Carrie. Rachel is an outsider, different to most other school kids. Again, there is a maniacal, god-fearing mother,\nhelping to explain to us why Rachel got into that world-hating state in the first\nplace. However, where Carrie's mother was a disturbing, ever-present force\nthroughout the original film, adding to its imposing mood, Rachel's mother\n(played convincingly by J Smith Cameron) is safely locked away in Ark ham Asylum. There is very little point to her character, other than to force a link\nbetween the two films. It turns out that Carrie and Rachel are half-sisters, related by their womanizing father. The plot flows almost identically to the former\nfilm, with similar set pieces. Eventually, towards the end of the film, we are\nawarded with a fantastic special effects laden finale. Combined with over the\ntop gore, it becomes nearly impossible to care about the characters anymore.\nYou'll have more fun sitting back and laughing at the death scenes.\nThe Rage is disappointing but there are some pleasing performances throughout the cast, especially from Emily Bergl in her big screen debut. Oddly, clips\nfrom the first movie are unnecessarily spliced into some of the scenes and Carrie fans will even recognise familiar sounds edited into the soundtrack. You\ncan't blame anyone for comparing the two films. Unfortunately, whatever technique is employed, nothing will distract you from coming to the conclusion that\nThe Rage is anything more than an updated remake. What is unacceptable is\nthat, in the end, the story is redundant. You're probably better off renting Carrie on video. It is also difficult to recommend the film. The difficulty and disappointment lies in the fact that despite all the pointlessness, there is a lot of obvious talent in this movie, and whether you like it or not, the ranks of hot, young\nacting ability will continue to grow.\n(mr an Sunil\n\n"

Are you ready for the\nDigital Age?\nWhat's the story...\nBob Dylan has probably caught the Zeitgeist of the age better than most. His lyrics are truer now than when they were penned in 1 9 6 3 . What is\nthe idea of this new business section? Simple. If\nyou are reading this article then you are pro b ably a student at IC, which is one of the better\ntechnical and scientific universities in the country.\nIt has an international reputation. So what? This\ncolumn proposes that of all the universities in the\ncountry, IC is best poised to take advantage of turning its intellectual capital into the basis for world class companies. Looking across the pond\nThe first question that needs to be answered is\ncan Britain compete with the 8 0 0 1 b gorilla of the\nworld economy: the good ol' US of A? Let's just\nlist some world class American technical universities: MIT; Texas A&M; Stanford; Caltech; Berkley. Pick anyone of these: Stanford say. In\nthe past 2 0 years here are some companies, that\nyou might have heard of, that had there roots in\nthis institution: Sun; Silicon Graphics; Yahoo; Amazon; Cisco. The list goes on. An interesting exercise to do, is to get a copy of the Financial Times, look\nat the Nasdaq share prices page and calculate\nthe combined value of these companies. I challenge anyone to name a European university that\nhas produced so many valuable companies in\nthe past twenty years.\nThe twenty year test\nI picked twenty years because it is a number that\nis easy to relate to, it's probably about the mean age of an IC undergrad. In twenty years time\nmany of us will be in our forties, or thereabouts.\nHow many billion dollar companies do you think\nwill be created as a result of a direct association with IC? Feel free to email Felix with your\nanswers.\nHowever, if you stretch the boundaries of this\nlittle exercise it will include companies like Intel\nand Hewlett-Packard, and the combined value\nstarts to look silly.\nThe profit motive\nThe historians of the age will probably focus on the exploits of men and women of scientific\ngenius, citing names such as Lovelace, Babbage, Turing, von Neumann, and Cray. That's probably why Iam not a historian. Don't misunderstand meI respect all of the above hugely,\nand I'm sure there are people of their calibre\namongst our ge ne ra tion at IC. But while science\nis the fuel of progress, business has and always\nwill be, the engine of progress. Who doesn't want to make a profit? Be it an individual, company, institution or country. It is the profit motive\nthat has driven the shift from Machine Age to\nDigital Age and to whatever age comes next.\nMaybe even Internet Age? And it has been an epic shift.\nWhat bugs me is how little advantage IC\n(institution, students and le cuter s) has taken of\nthe changes in the global economy, especially\nthe commercial is ation of the internet. After all, the WorldWide Web was created just down the\nroad by a UCL lecturer. This column has a healthy sce pti c sim about the rate at which\nEurope is producing world beating high tech\ncompanies. Have you heard the story of Darryl\nMattocks? Darryl who?\nSix years ago two guys in their early thirties,\nindependently had the same idea. One of them\nwas in Seattle the other in Oxford. They both set\nup what each claimed to be the world's biggest\non-line bookstore. Both listed around a million\nbooks, both were equally accessible from any-where in the world, and both offered similar\nservices for customers, such as e mail notification when a new book by a favourite author had arrived. In theory this should have been a classic\nexample of how the internet would make an on sense of geography? Wrong. You know the story about the other guy pro b ably better than Ido. Who is he? Jeff Bezos,\neveryone's favourite internet billionaire. What happened to Darryl you may ask? Well, he didn't do too badly I suppose: he sold out for about two million pounds. This case study is a salutary lesson for any-one out there considering starting their own high\ntech business. Let's propose the following hypothesis: for any given high tech idea, with\neverything else being equal, it is a heck of a sight\neasier to turn it into a market leading business\nproposition in the US than outside of it. This is\nnot to say it is impossible but for practical purposes the distinction seems slight. This column will seek to explore the reasons this appears to\nbe the case. The government is so concerned that it published a hefty e commerce study this\nsummer E is good\nOpen any newspaper, watch any TV channel, listen to any radio station and you will be bombarded about' e commerce'. Quite a lot of the\ntalk is rubbish. The truth about e commerce at\nthe moment is that very few companies knowhow to make a profit using it. Hence the wealth\nof views, articles and opinions. It is often a case\nof the blind leading the blind. Here'san idea, if\nyou want to make a lot cash become a ne commerce consultant. At times of confusion and uncertainty people seek certainty. Hence any 'visionary' who states his case convincingly enough will be heard through the noise. Who is\nthe Henry Ford of the Internet age? There a few potential candidates out there and this column will seek to separate the wheat from the chaff.\nIt's the economics, stupid\nHaving a bright idea, or a killer application in\nthe current lingo, or being the smartest person\non the planet can actually count for surprisingly\nlittle. Not even the biggest country in the world\ncan defy the laws of economics, let alone anyone individual. From the business perspective,\nthe internet has not yet destroyed distance as the\nbook selling example shows.\nAnother area that this column intends to\nexplore is what infrastructure is required to give\nImperial a competitive advantage. It boils down to why is there not an equivalent to Silicon Val ley here. There have been murmuring s about Silicon Fen, and it is certainly a potential com pet i tor to any London based high tech centre.The\npoint can be illustrated by stating an extreme\nexample. An African teenager with the smartest\ninternet idea is not going to get very far, if he is\nstuck in his village.\nKick off\nThis column will kick off with series of articles\nprofiling of a former Imperial PhD student and one time lecturer, who I like to think of as the Billion Dollar Doc. Watch this space. Bashari Bakari\n\n"
