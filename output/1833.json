    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n22 | Books 10 November 2023\nI\nf Gustave Flaubert had begun his beloved Madame\nBovary with, as one might have thought, Madame\nBovary, it would not be strange to imagine the first\nwords (albeit in a very 18th\n-century manner) coming\nacross like the opening of an Old Hollywood romance.\nIt would describe our eponymous protagonist, perhaps\npeering over a balcony, with a hopeless longing on her\nfair face. It would brim with a sentimentality accustomed only to emotion obscured behind the heavy grain\nof film. And the rhythm in Flaubert\u2019s sentences would\nmove only by the sounds of a loud and lonely string or-chestra.\nBut a question to myself: why Madame Bovary? And\nwhy now?\nThe title cemented itself as one of the greatest to hit\nthe literary industry, but picking it up from a forgotten\npile of books on my bedroom floor was nothing more\nthan a fateful means to pass time on my 50-minute\ncommute. Innocence and naivet\u00e9 were good qualities\nto come into reading it with. Reading Madame Bovary\nunder such mundane conditions shrunk Flaubert from\nliterary giant to simply another writer, and opened me\nup to a series of small revelations that emphasised the\nimportance of fiction. But back to the novel.\nSay dramatic irony were a disease; then Madame\nBovary is down bad. In this 1856 novel, Flaubert depicts\nthe mind of Emma Bovary \u2013 his protagonist \u2013 with a narrative voice that neither casts judgment nor offers defences for her, but is there to merely, solely, depict her\ncharacter. But there are also instances of carefully crafted disconnect, one in which our knowledge of the hopes\nand motivations of one character become shattered\nby the actions and beliefs of another, and this piece of\nFrench realism begins to unfold with a sort of didactic,\nalmost theatrical quality. Do not be deceived \u2013 Madame\nBovary is a novel on and of romance.\nFlaubert portrays Emma through her many woes in\nlove. But fret not reader, through these overlapping and\ninterweaving stories of a hopeless romantic, the story is\ndeeply involved in the ideas and psychology of romance;\nquestioning the exact origins and intent of desire and\nwhat it means to romanticise. To this effect, the language of Flaubert carries the grandeur and exuberance\nof the ideas that he captures, mimics, and sometimes\nmocks, effectively building these themes up across his\nmagnum opus.\nThe novel tells the story of a woman married to a boring man called Charles. It is this life of boredom that\nFlaubert uses to set the stage for Bovary\u2019s many acts of\nescapism \u2013 balls, clothes shopping, affairs \u2013 to avoid\nthe inescapable, inevitable dread attached to her married existence. Is this whetting your literary appetite?\nIf not, then that\u2019s exactly the point. Flaubert targets the\nMadame\nBovary,\nsitting\nonthe\nVictoria\nLine\nBOOKS\nTo quote Gustave\nFlaubert: \u201cShe wanted\nto die, but she also\nwanted to live in Paris.\u201d\nBooksEditor\nFIYINFOLUWA T. OLADIPO\nSay dramatic irony were\na disease; Madame\nBovary is down bad.\n\u201c\nLady in Blue: an oil painting of the eponymous character. Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial BFI LONDON FILM FESTIVAL | 19\nISSUE #1834\nY\noYorgos Lanthimos\u2019s Poor Things offers a bizarre re-imagining of the classical Frankenstein tale, which\nyou wouldn\u2019t know if you haven\u2019t watched the trailer or read any other promo material. When we first meet\nBella, her speech, walk, and actions are confusing. Just\nlike the professor\u2019s\nassistant, we find ourselves wondering why\nshe behaves this way\nand what led to her\ncurrent state. However, it doesn\u2019t take\nlong to discover that\nshe\u2019s Godwin Baxter\u2019s\n(Willem Dafoe) exper-iment, along with the\ngoose-headed pug,\nduck-headed goat,\nand other peculiar\ncreatures. It is mpor-tant to note that Bella Baxter, played by\nEmma Stone, calls him\n\u201cGod\u201d, perhaps based\non his teachings. As\nwe delve into Bella\u2019s\nworld, we see research\nassistant Max, played\nby Ramy Youssef, fall\nin love with her, despite her weirdness\nand unclear origins.\nBut, unfortunately\nfor him, right after\ntheir engagement, a\nsolicitor named Duncan Wedderburn visits Baxter\u2019s mansion,\nseduces Bella and\nconvinces her to join\nhim in his grand and,\napparently, sex-filled adventure.\nDuncan is a hilarious character who goes through\nmany emotional stages with Bella. Mark Ruffalo\u2019s performance was truly elevating for the character and was\na perfect casting for the role.\nThroughout the film, we witness Bella\u2019s transforma-tion, as she explores her senses and desires. This story is\ntruly fascinating to watch, as a once unconscious being\ndiscovers taste, pleasure, fear, disgust, and a variety of\nother feelings and emotions. The film also doesn\u2019t shy\naway from the explicit elements of her awakening and\nfeatures multiple scenes of full nudity in sexual scenarios labelled by her as \u201cfurious jumping.\u201d\nWhile the film initially adopts the classic black-and-white cinematography associated with many Frankenstein reprises, as Bella\u2019s journey unfolds colors gradually\ngrace the screen. She escapes the eerie mansion, venturing into a world unlike any I\u2019ve ever seen. The Baroque\nstylistic choice perfectly complements this unique tale\nand demonstrates Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s technical and imaginative prowess. Some locations even depict Biblical\nimagery, such as the Tower of Babylon, suggesting possible sources of inspiration for the director.\nThe production\nteam and costume designers deserve a special mention for their\nbrilliant use of shapes\nand colors. The vivid thematic elements\nof the world held me\ncaptive, as I eagerly\nsought out every intricate detail on the\nscreen.

The \u2018limerent\u2019 describes the person\nafflicted with limerence. It manifests\nitself as intrusive thinking, idealising,\nthe fear of rejection, and dependence of\nmood on the LO\u2019s actions. It is neither\nlove nor lust, as it relies on the doubt or\nabsence of reciprocity.\nIn arts and photography, limerence is\nnot widely discussed. It\u2019s hard to imagine\nhow the concept might present itself naturally in the compositions of light and\nshapes that can be captured on camera or\ncanvas. I think this might be because lim-erence does not have a definite object. Or\nrather, limerence is not about loving the\nLO, it\u2019s about the want to be loved by them,\nas Jean-Paul Sartre notes. In other words,\nlimerence is not about who one aims\nthese feelings towards, but about oneself.\nWell, if the LO is not important, then\nthere\u2019s no picture to take, you might\nthink. It\u2019s logical then to assume we can\nonly describe it visually by presenting\nthe limerent and the environment that\nsurrounds them. Can we portray the\nsubject to fit our intuition of limerence?\nMaybe, but I think it\u2019s far easier to have\nthe environment speak for the limerent.\nAccording to my own interpretation of\nwhat limerence would look like through\na visual medium, Owen used what I think\nis the perfect combination of colours for\nthe background: purple, or the sum of\nblues and reds. These become the vehicle\nof the limerence, as \u2018I\u2019m feeling blue\u2019 and\n\u2018blushing\u2019 are two great representations\nof the concept\u2019s characteristics. Thus, in\nviewing the purple haze of a Hong Kong\nsunset we might find ourselves wondering if the limerent girl wishes there was\nsomebody there to share it with, possibly\na person who had become the centre of\nher world a few days prior.\nI also propose an alternative, more\nambitious interpretation. Maybe it is the\nviewer that is the limerent, and what we\nare looking at is in fact the LO. We could\neven imagine anybody we want as the\nsubject of Owen\u2019s photo and transfer our\nown idealisations onto it. As such, the\nphoto becomes but a mirror of the LO\nhidden in our own minds. Look my way is\nthe photographer\u2019s thought as they take\nthe picture and, by extension, the viewer\u2019s thought.\n\u2019Limerence enters your life pleasantly,\u2019\nwrites Dorothy Tennov, the psychologist\nwho first coined the term in 1979. And it\nis a pleasant, limerent experience looking through Owen\u2019s lens.\nLimerence\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nTo love, to be\nloved, or is it love\nat all?\nScan the QR code to\nsubmit for the next\ntheme \u2018CitySilence\u2018:\nLook my way.

Students who have\nbeen elected to represent the interests of their\nvoters instead stare glumly into the distance, and\nwish they were anywhere but here.\nA paragon of democracy it is not.\nThis made Tuesday\u2019s session of Council all the\nmore interesting \u2013 two significant motions were\npassed, each of them of the type normally seen only\nonce in a year. As usual, about half of Union Council\u2019s\nelected had nothing to say, but for once, the student\nbody itself decided to engage with Council.\nYour Editor counted seven students who had\nturned up of their own volition to support a motion\naccusing both Imperial and ICU of \u2018disregard[ing]\nthe voices of the wider community of students on\ncampus\u2019. Whether or not you support the motion,\nwhich called on ICU to condemn Israel\u2019s retaliatory\nattacks on Gaza, it was hard not to be impressed by\nthe fact that for once, Union Council was alive.\nThe arguments presented by both sides were\nat times stilted. (For example, President Camille\nBoutrolle argued that condemning Israel\u2019s retaliatory\nattacks \u201ccould have legal implications for the\nUnion\u201d, but when pressed was unable to elaborate.)\nNevertheless, there was, for once, some sensible\ndebate, and ultimately, the motion was passed.\nAn equally noteworthy motion was presented by\nImperial Climate Action (ICA), Imperial\u2019s homegrown\nclimate activism group. Seconded by Union\nPresident Boutrolle and three other ICU Officer\nTrustees, ICA convinced Council to back calls for\nImperial to divest from fossil fuel companies.\nThis newspaper has covered the College\u2019s\nexisting policy extensively in recent weeks. Imperial\ncontinues to invest in oil and gas companies \u2018that\ndemonstrate they are actively moving towards\nmeeting Paris Agreement targets\u2019 \u2013 and it sticks to\nthis line with an almost religious fervour.\nBoth of the motions above must be approved by\nICU\u2019s Board of Trustees.\nIf given the go-ahead, ICU will lobby Imperial to\ncondemn Israel and to divest from fossil fuels. In the\nlatter case at least, it will have some impact.\n*\nI\nn any other week, the passing of either of these\nmotions would have been front-page news.\nBut this just so happened to be the week that\nFelix broke a national news story, beating papers\nsuch as the Daily Mail to the scoop by securing\na (then) exclusive interview with the subject, Mr\nManoj Sen.\nMailOnline lost no time stealing our thunder,\nscrambling to publish a \u2018follow\u2019 article, initially\nlittered with inaccuracies. But when you see the\nstory online or in print, know that it\u2019s Felix wot broke\nit.\nSelina Ye\n\n"

The French students understand\nthat fresh baguette can go stale within\nthe same day and Germans keep bakeries open even on Sundays. On the other\nhand, bread from the grocery store is sold\nin bags with roughly 20-24 slices, lasting\na single student for perhaps six days.\nThat, is not bread.\nIf we define bread to be a mixture of\nflour, water and optionally some yeast,\nmany types of bread would instead be\nconsidered cake. There is nothing wrong\nwith that - but then toast should not be\nconsidered bread.\nMaking bread at home is not too dif-ficult. Obviously, there are millions of\nrecipes online, but the little secret involves bread-mixes. They require roughly 500ml of lukewarm water, a few hours\nfor sitting and 1 to 1.5 hours of baking in\nthe oven to produce the bread that you\nwant. No kneeding, surprised?\nA typical breadmix comes as a dry-mix, hence it can be portioned to produce smaller\nloafs of bread at different\npoints during the week or\nthe month. Consumers can\nalso choose to add whatever nuts or dried fruit they\ndesire into the mix. In my\nlast loaf, I added chia seeds.\nThe outcome is a dense\nslice of goodness without\nany added sugars or preservatives.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial \ufeff | 11\nISSUE #1833\nT\nransportation is a divisive subject in climate change\ndiscourse. The need to continue using oil for fuel;\nuse of private versus public vehicles; how privilege\nlessens the impact of taxation; and electrification as a\nsustainable transportation model, for example. These\npoints are all intertwined, but my focus for the next\ncouple of weeks will be on pedestrianisation and public\ntransport as sustainability solutions.\nIn 1977, Groningen in the Netherlands implemented\ntheir Traffic Circulation Plan, that effectively created a\nno-car, pedestrianised zone overnight, centred around\nVismarkt square, by redirecting and restricting cars to a\none-way inner circle road. The move was implemented\nby Max van den Berg - a young politician with a vision\nof a car-less city - with support from the public, and other young and like-minded politicians. Given the Netherlands\u2019 current reputation as the cycling capital of the\nworld, this kind of forward thinking might come as no\nsurprise now, but in the \u201870s, citizens were flummoxed\nby the sudden inconvenience in taking their car to run\nerrands, and local shopkeepers thought that the lack of\ncars would harm their businesses.\nOn the contrary, footfall, sales, and employment increase in such pedestrianised areas. The reduced number of cars directly benefits citizens through significant\ndecreases in air and noise pollution, which creates a\nmore pleasant atmosphere. Additionally, a sense of safety and community is nurtured, and this pedestrian-cen-tric experience is particularly beneficial for children\nand older people.\nOther cities hosting similarly pedestrianised urban\nareas include Zagreb in Croatia, Brussels in Belgium,\nand Almaty in Kazakhstan. Brussels boasts the largest\npedestrian-only zone in Europe, located near many of\ntheir historic landmarks and unveiled in 2015. Zagreb\u2019s\npedestrian zone is centred around Ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107\nSquare, enclosing many of the city\u2019s biggest tourist attractions and shopping outlets.\nThereisanotherexampleofthismuchclosertohome:\nBute Street, just down the road from South Kensington\nstation. The street has been restricted to vehicles since\nsummer 2021 and is now officially being redeveloped\ninto a fully pedestrianised avenue, where car access will\nbe limited to delivery and emergency vehicles.\nOf course, there are multiple steps that must be taken\nfor such a pedestrianising project to be approved. Locals\nhad to advocate for it and gain support from the relevant\nstakeholders (local council, stores, and residents), and,\nmost importantly, it actually has to be feasible.\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that these kinds of initiatives haven\u2019t\ntaken hold on a larger scale, but the barriers to their\nimplementation are considerable. But imagine somewhere like Oxford Street or Exhibition Road being fully\npedestrianised (the latter is already halfway there!) and\nwhat a difference it could make to the experiences of\nshopping and attending university.\nThe \u201915-minute city\u2019 is an urban-planning concept in\nwhich all essentials are available to every citizen within\na 15-minute walk or cycle. Proposed by Carlos Moreno\n\u2013 a French-Colombian researcher in city planning \u2013 in\n2015, the concept has unfortunately been met with re-sistance, with some seeing it as paving the way for large-scale gentrification. It would also be challenging to extend the plan to suburban areas, where accessibility is\nalready much lower than in urban areas. Conspiracy\ntheorists even believe it to be a method for governments\nto repress or restrict communities to a particular radius.\nDespite this opposition, the idea has been adopted\nin a few places around the world. Melbourne, Australia\nhas devised a plan to create 20-minute neighbourhoods\nthroughout the city between 2017 and 2050, and Ottawa, Canada has proposed a similar plan for developing\na network of 15-minute neighbourhoods over the next\n25 years.\nThese projects can only be executed if the general\npopulus show the engagement and initiative to carry\nthemout.Governmentsneedtofollowsuit,aswellasen-suring, through targeted regulations and development,\nthat such neighbourhoods will be effective in meeting\nthe needs of their citizens. Informed decision-making\nand consultations are crucial for establishing safe environments and protecting the poorer people in these\ncommunities. Willingness of people to advocate for radical ideas only comes if the systems in place encourage\nand facilitate them.\nIs it possible that the only way to put people off driving cars is to completely cut them off from being able\nto use them? The alternative for longer distance travel\n\u2013 public transportation \u2013 is another widely-debated sub-ject, and one that I\u2019ll look into in next week\u2019s issue.\nOn foot or by car?\nThe choice\nshould be simple\nWITH ZANNA BUCKLAND\n\n"

Cut to\nthe evening and the\nbuilding\u2019s fire alarms\nring, forcing Adam to\nvacate the comfort of\nhis home.\nHe appears intrigued by the sight of\na neighbour who has\nblatantly ignored the\nalarm, silhouetted in\none of the building\u2019s\nwindows. This exposition builds up to an\neventual meet-cute\nbetween Adam and\nthe younger man he\nlearns is called Harry (Paul Mescal), prompting the early\ndays of a relationship.\nAlongside the couple\u2019s blossoming romance runs\nalongside Adam\u2019s regular visits to his parents (Claire\nFoy and Jamie Bell), who are still living in the suburban\nneighbourhood where he grew up. However, through\nthe countless hours we spend with Adam as he travels\nback and forth on the train, there is a sense that things\naren\u2019t quite right.\nAndrew Scott is ay in real life whilst Paul Mescal isn\u2019t,\nbut the two have amazing chemistry regardless, as does\nScott with Foy and Bell. This allows Haigh to really sell\nthe relationships as being deep and true, which is particularly important given that the film is partly inspired\nby Haigh\u2019s own experience of growing up queer in the\n\u201870s - he even filmed\nscenes in his actual\nchildhood home. He\nties in the feelings\nof guilt and anxiety\namong the queer community at the time,\nespecially due to the\nprevalence of AIDS.\nAdam\u2019s relationship\nwith his parents mirrors the interactions\nbetween many young\npeople and their families who were in a\nsimilar position, with\nhis mother showing\nconcern, rather than\nanger or enthusiasm,\nupon learning about\nhis new boyfriend.\nAll Of Us Strangers is\na maze of a narrative,\nfacilitated by impressive sound engineer-ing, an intense score,\nand a knack for framing poignant shots of\nthe characters\u2019 emo-tions. Despite closing\nout on a nice scene\nof the couple, Haigh\ndoes a brilliant job of\nleaving the audience\nfeeling ill at ease and\nuncertain about the\nevents that took place. I would definitely recommend\nthe watch, especially since this review doesn\u2019t do the\nfilm justice; just be prepared to feel a little strange af-terwards.\nQueer is polite, like all\nthe dicks were taken out\n\u201c\nRelease Date January 26, 2024\nRunning time 105 minutes\n26\nJAN\nDirected by Andrew Haigh\nWritten by Andrew Haigh\nProduced by Graham Broadbent,\nPete Czernin, Sarah Harvey\nStarring Andrew Scott,\nPaul Mescal,\nJamie Bell,\nClaire Foy\nDeputyEditor-in-Chief\nZANNA BUCKLAND\n\n"

Evidently a cultural phenomenon, the\nBlack comedy attracted masses of London\u2019s Black community to the Southbank Centre with its\npromise of Samuel\u2019s\nsignature mix of hu-mour, drama, and an\nincredible score.\nSetting the film in\nbiblical times, Samuel inserts a character named Clarence\n(played by LaKeith\nStanfield, who was\nalso in The Harder\nThey Fall) into the\nstory of Jesus\u2019s cruci-fixion. Clarence is a\ncynic, and has little\nreverence for the Messiah, who has adopted\nClarence\u2019s twin brother as one of his disci-ples. The story follows\nhis journey through\nseeing the opportunity to profit from\nperforming so-called\n\u2018miracles\u2019 for crowds,\nto understanding the\nneed to have faith and\nbelieve in things other\nthan simply what\u2019s in\nfront of him.\nFor pretending to\nbe the Messiah and\nscamming people out\nof their money, and\nthen for not giving up the real one, Clarence is ultimately crucified by the Romans, along with many of his\nbrethren.\nThe residents of this altered Jerusalem, who are mostly black, are constantly at war with the white Romans.\nThis seems to overtly represent the disparity between\nwhite cops and marginalised Black communities in cit-ies, without feeling jarring or overstated. One running\ntheme is the idea that, whilst people within the community might have their differences, when it comes to\nstanding up against others (like the Romans) who seek\nto oppress them, they will always band together.\nThe long list of actors in the cast includes RJ Cyler,\nCaleb McLaughlin, Alfre Woodard, Teyana Taylor, David\nOyelowo, Anna Diop, and Omar Sy. Notably, on IMDb\nthe supporting actors who feature most heavily in the\nproject are much lower down in the credits, while James\nMcAvoy and Benedict Cumberbatch, who probably only\nhave about 20 minutes of screen time or less, are second and third on the\nlist. The real Messiah is played by black\nBritish actor Nicholas\nPinnock, subverting\nthe audience\u2019s typical\nimage of God\u2019s son.\nWhat stood out the\nmost throughout the\nfilm was the music,\nco-produced by Jay-Z,\nthat nicely complemented the plot. Samuel\u2019s own background\nas a music producer\ngives him a leg up in\nthis department, and\nhe even claims to \u201csee\nmusic and hear the\nfilm when writing the\nsoundtrack\u201d. The costumes were also stun-ning, which can be\ncredited to Antoinette\nMessam, who was also\nSamuel\u2019s costume designer from The Harder They Fall.\nThis was one of the\nbest films I\u2019ve seen in\na long time, and I can\u2019t\nthink of any criticisms\nfor it \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be\nsurprised to see it recognised in the next\nawards season. Samuel\u2019s visions are spectacular, and his hope is that people will watch his films and see stories they can relate\nto, as well as to \u201creintroduce innocence and hope\u201d. For\nhim, filmmaking is \u201cnot a dream; it\u2019s an aim, intentions,\nplans\u201d, and The Book of Clarence is a plan he has managed\nto execute to perfection.\nI\u2019d never overthrow Rome\n\u2013 my good friend is Roman.\n\u201c\nRelease Date January 19, 2024\nRunning time 136 minutes\n19\nJAN\nDirected by Jeymes Samuel\nWritten by Jeymes Samuel\nProduced by Jeymes Samuel, Shawn Carter,\nJames Lassiter, Tendo Nagenda\nStarring LaKeith Stanfield, David Oyelowo\nOmar Sy, Anna Diop, RJ Cyler,\nMicheal Ward, Alfre Woodard,\nTeyana Taylor, Caleb McLaughlin, ...\nDeputyEditor-in-Chief\nZANNA BUCKLAND\n\n"

Martin Scorsese\u2019s new film, Killers of the Flower Moon,\npromises a lot; and it absolutely delivers.\nThe film is based on the eponymous book which tells\nthe true story of the\nOsage Nation. A Midwestern Native American tribe, the Osage\neventually settled in\nOklahoma, where \u2013\nas luck would have it\n\u2013 the land was rich in\noil.Owningtheminer-al rights on their land,\nmany Osage natives\nbecame wealthy, but\ntheir luck would soon\nturn as unscrupulous\nbusinessmen tried to\nprofit off them. The\nfilm focuses on the socalled \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019\nof the 1920\u2019s, when\nmany of the Osage saw\ntheir headrights taken\naway through legal\nloopholes and, more\nheinously, murder.\nLeonardo DiCaprio\nplays Ernest Burkhart,\na down-in-the-dumps\nWWI veteran with a\nperpetual frown and\nlittle to look forward\nto in life. That is until his uncle, William\nHale (Robert De Niro),\nself-proclaimed \u2018King\nof the Osage Hills\u2019,\nproposes a business\nopportunity. Long-time friend and sponsor of the res-ervation, Hale points out the benefits of marrying into\nMollie\u2019s (Lily Gladstone) wealthy Osage family. But the\nfewer descendants in the family, the more money there\nis to go around for the Hales\u2026 the conclusion is, as Imperial professors would say, trivial.\nThe three leads all do a fantastic job of depicting the\nintricate interpersonal relationships and power dynamics on the reservation. DiCaprio is believable as the adrift\nyoung man who falls deeper and deeper into corruption,\nraising interesting questions about the true nature of\nevil. The real scene-stealer for me was Lily Gladstone,\nquietly observing the horrors around her and finding\nherself in an inescapable bind. But what truly strikes\nthe viewer is subverting the expectations for a story set\nin the \u2018Roaring 20\u2019s\u2019. Instead of the glamorous community of white party-goers that you would expect from\nthat era, the upper class in Killers of the Flower Moon is\nmade up of the Indian Council, a group of tribal chiefs,\nelders and family heads speaking out for the needs of\nthe Native communi-ty. As local and state\nsheriffs turn a blind\neye to the murders of\nthe rich Osage, the Indian Council reach out\nto the newly-founded\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, led by J.\nEdgar Hoover, to finally crack the case.\nAs you can probably tell by now, this is\na story of corruption,\nbetrayal, greed, race,\nfamily, and, strange-ly, even love. There is\nso much to unpack\nand explore that I\nwould be tempted to\nsuggest it would have\nbeen better suited as a\n4-part mini-series, to\nallow the viewer some\nbreathing room between the intertwining intrigues. Nonetheless, the script is\nexpertly crafted and\nnever feels like it drags\non for too long. Despite its behemothic\nlength, the film manages to keep your attention throughout,\nin large part thanks\nto the incredible directorial work. I would call Killers of\nthe Flower Moon a veritable Hollywood classic: the perfect storm of great actors and a great story. Go watch it\nnow, or for the sake of your bladder, wait until it comes\nto streaming; it\u2019s produced by Apple TV+.\nRelease Date October 20, 2023\nRunning time 206 minutes\n20\nOCT\nDirected by Martin Scorsese\nScreenplay by Eric Roth, Martin Scorsese\nProduced by Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas,\nMartin Scorsese, Daniel Lupi\nStarring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro,\nLily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons\nTantoo Cardinal, John Lithgow,\nBrendan Fraser, ...\nFilmWriter\nIOANA ESANU\n\n"

And, no, it\u2019s not your typical\nRomeo & Juliet tale; it\u2019s actually quite the opposite \u2013 ob-sessive, unsettling, and deeply disturbing. The original\nscreenplay of Saltburn\nby Emerald Fennel, is\nan R-rated psychological thriller drama primarily set in the mid-2000s at an English\ncountry estate .\nIt opens with a confession of love, albeit a\nrather creepy one, like\nthe words of a secret\nstalker. The mysterious man behind this\nvoice remains unknown at this point,\nbut we come to know\nhim as Oliver (played\nby Barry Keoghan), a\nfresher at Oxford. Oliver is your quintessential nerdy guy with\na scholarship, coming\nfrom a working-class\nbackground. From\nthe first day, he\u2019s recognised by his kind,\nforming a bond with a\nfellow nerd. However,\nwe aren\u2019t able to grow\ntoo attached to this\ncharacter, as Oliver\nsoon abandons him\nfor Felix. Who is Felix,\nyou ask? Unfortunately, this is not a story of\nour newspaper\u2019s or-igins. Rather, Felix is the subject of the earlier confes-sion, who is exceptionally hot and filthy rich. Regardless\nof gender or sexuality, a single glance from a guy like Felix quickens the heartbeat of everyone who meets him.\nSo how do two such different classmates even start\ntalking? As it turns out, a flat tire is all it takes to join\nthe cool kids. After offering his bike to a stranded Felix,\nOliver is invited for drinks with him and his entourage.\nOne thing leads to another and \u2013 no, they don\u2019t fall in\nlove \u2013 they become best mates. Not everyone supports\ntheir friendship, suggesting that Oliver is another one of\nFelix\u2019s \u2018charity cases\u2019: \u201cHe will get bored of you ...\u201d.\nUpon hearing news that Oliver\u2019s dad has died, Felix invites him to his family estate in Saltburn for the\nsummer, since Oliver is devastated and can\u2019t bear the\nthought of returning to his troubled family. That\u2019s where\nit all begins, and you\u2019re in for a ride. Secrets, drama, lies,\nand questionable decisions are the bones of the film.\nEmeraldFennelldidagreatjobatcomicallyportraying\nthe most upper class\nand how detached\nthey are from the real\nworld: \u201dPamela died...\nshe\u2019d do anything for\nattention!\u201d Although\nthe movie sometimes\ntakes dark turns, its\nbizarre events and\nwitty one-liners evoke\na wide range of emotional reactions from\nthe audience. Fennell\nclearly knew what she\nwas doing and aimed\nto capture our attention with something\nviewers are not used\nto seeing on the big\nscreen.\nThe sound, cine-matography, produc-tion, and cast\u2019s per-formances, especially\nRosamundPike\u2019s,were\nall exceptional and\ncontributed greatly\nto the movie\u2019s quality.\nI confidently recommend you watch Saltburn; however, I can\u2019t\ncall it among the best.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong;\nit was a wild ride, but\nthe final drop of the\nrollercoaster was too\nsteep. The ending felt rushed and somewhat too fictional without significant consequences, as if the character had written his own dream ending. Despite all this,\na few scenes in the movie will forever be etched in my\nmemory.\nRelease Date November 17, 2023\nRunning time 131 minutes\n17\nNOV\nDirected by Emerald Fennell\nWritten by Emerald Fennell\nProduced by Emerald Fennell, Josey McNamara,\nTom Ackerley, Margot Robbie\nStarring Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi,\nRosamund Pike, Richard E.

I proposed Berenjak, a Persian-style restaurant that had been\ncollecting dust on my want-to-try list. We checked availability for our preferred date - no luck. We tried the day\nafter, the weekend after, and the one after that. None of\nthem were available either. Succumbing to the \u201cwant\nwhat you can\u2019t have\u201d trope, we determinedly booked\nthe first Saturday evening table we could find. For the\nSoho branch, this happened to be on 7th October, and\nthroughout July, August, and September, we avidly\nglanced over the Berenjak menu in an effort to gear up\nfor the meal that was to come.\nWaking up on 7th October was not far from waking\nup on Christmas morning; months of anticipation had\nbuilt up to a child-like eagerness to sit down at the dinner table. As we impatiently bided the time until the\nevening hours, we couldn\u2019t help but wonder: would this\nbe the meal to change our lives?\nWith our table booked for 20:15, we dutifully arrived\nfive minutes earlier. Tucked into a bustling side street\nof Soho, Berenjak\u2019s open counter design manages to account for what feels like the large majority of the alley\u2019s\nfootfall. After sneaking our way through curious crowds\neyeing the restaurant, we managed to inform the staff,\nnot without a hint of pride, that yes, we had a booking.\nWhile waiting for our table to be prepared, we couldn\u2019t\nhelp but grin at the two-hour waiting list announcement to passers-by. We were incredibly glad that we had\nour four months old booking.\nDespite arriving at Berenjak early, our table was ready\nonly 15 minutes after our booked time. We sat in the\nback room of the restaurant where dim lights and mellow music made for a warm welcome, and we cozied up\non the corner table. After careful examination of the\nmenu, which was more of a cross-check with our memorised version, we were diligently explained the menu\nand portion sizes before placing our order. The service\nremained great throughout the meal, though we were\nasked to leave at the end because the next guests were\nwaiting outside.\nFor starters, based on the recommended quantity, we\nwent with the Sangkak (flatbread, \u00a34), Hummus (\u00a37.50),\nMirza Ghasemi (cooked aubergine dip, \u00a38.50), and Panir\nSabzi (feta and herbs, \u00a38). All in all, very good options\nwiththeauberginedipbeingmypersonalfavourite.Coal\ncooked and nicely spiced, it had an almost meat-like flavour that was perfectly complemented by the bread. The\nhummus came in at a close second. Made with black\nchickpeas, its deep flavour carried us through our whole\nmeal and went nicely with the fresh herbs accompanying the feta dish. Personally, this was more than enough\nto take me through the night. But as so often, we were\ncriminally betrayed by our empty stomachs\u2019 greed, and\nthe big bulk of the order was still to come.\nFor our mains, we ordered the Jujeh kabab (chicken,\n\u00a319.50), the Koobideh kabab (minced lamb, \u00a318), and\nthe house rice (\u00a36), all recommended by our waitress.\nBoth meats were incredibly well flavoured and tender,\nleaving us remorseful about our earlier indulgence. The\nrice, though good, was nothing to write home about.\nWhen it comes to drinks, we went with Les Trois Domaines Blanc, Guerrouane, Morocco 2021. Albeit admittedly not a wine connoisseur, I did quite enjoy our selec-tion. To our surprise, it was the cheapest bottle on the\nmenu, though prices seemed to be set rather arbitrarily,\nwith 500ml costing \u00a320 and a whole 750ml bottle, \u00a332.\nNot to say that this discrepancy threw us off from ordering the bottle.\nDid we overpay for a meal that another London location would\u2019ve offered at a fraction of the price? Maybe.\nStill, the food was great, service was lovely, and the Soho\nlocation made for a great ambience during and after the\nvisit. Slight minus points for having to wait for the table\nand then being rushed out, though I do understand it\ngets busy on a Saturday evening. I would definitely re-turn, and, although maybe not life-changing, it was very\ngood food that certainly increased my appetite for Persian cuisine. 8.5/10.\nBerenjak, a not-so-secret spot in Soho\nFOOD&TRAVEL\nFood&TravelWriter\nDELIA GINCU\nRead as Delia discovers a culinary moment worth to wait four months for.\nCheck out Berenjak\u2019s Instagram Account\nHummus and Flatbread Delia Gincu\nJujeh Kabab and Koobideh Kabab Delia Gincu\nWould this be the meal to\nchange our lives?\n\u201c\n\n"

The treaty united governments across the globe and\nprovided a sense of optimism that the\nimminent climate disaster could be\naverted by bringing emissions to net-zero before 2050. However, the recent\nstudy led by Imperial College London\u2019s Dr\nRobin Lamboll, and published in Nature\nClimate Change under the title \u201cAssessing\nthe size and uncertainty of remaining\ncarbon budgets\u201d, has suggested that this\nclimate time bomb is ticking faster than\ninitially predicted. The emissions threshold could likely be exceeded by the end of\nthis decade.\nClimate budgets redefined\nIt has been known since early 1896 that\nthe acceleration of carbon dioxide emissions after the Industrial Revolution\nhad a possible threat to our climate\nwhen Svante Arrhenius published a\npaper titled \u201cOn the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground\u201d. Even so, it wasn\u2019t\nuntil the mid-twentieth century that\nglobal warming began to gain traction and measurable public interest.\nToday, climate change is regarded as one\nof the most pressing areas in scientific research. With ever-changing global\ndynamics and the constant emergence\nof new scientific models, perpetual\nevolution became an intrinsic property\nof the field of climate science, as illustrated by Lamboll\u2019s research.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) predicted that\nin order to have a 50% probability of\nachieving the goals set out by the Paris\nAgreement, a remaining carbon budget\nof 500 billion tonnes was available. The\nremaining carbon budget serves as a\nrepresentation of the amount of carbon\ndioxide which can be released into the\natmosphere without causing the temperature limit to be exceeded.\nLamboll\u2019s study made several key\nadjustments to the methods used in these\npredictions. Such adjustments incorporated newer emission data, updated\nclimate models, and adding non-carbon\ndioxide emissions into the data. Greenhouse gases encompass a range of compounds that have a similar blanketing\neffect on the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, so considering the amounts of other gases like\nmethane and nitrous oxide simultaneously being emitted will reduce the remaining carbon budget.\nAdditionally, the study incorporated\nthe impact of aerosols, small particles\nwhichcanbereleasedintotheatmosphere\nduringcombustion.Themajoirtyofthese\nparticles reduce the Earth\u2019s temperature\nby scattering and reflecting sunlight,\nand provide seeds for cloud formation.\nBoth reduce the amount of energy that\nreaches the Earth\u2019s surface. As the global\nenergy landscape shifts from fossil fuels\nto renewable sources, fewer aerosols will\nbe released into the atmosphere, diminishing this cooling effect, and further\nshrinking the remaining carbon budget.\nConsequently, this has dramatically\naccelerated the timeline, pushing the\nnet-zero deadline forward to 2029, based\non a remaining carbon budget of 250\nbillion tonnes and current emission rates\nof approximately 40 billion tonnes per\nyear.\nLooking ahead to COP28\nWith the 2023 United Nations\nClimate Change Conference (UNFCC\nCOP28) in Dubai approaching at the end\nof this month, research like Lamboll\u2019s\nintensifies the pressure on world lead-ers. It amplifies the call for reconstruction of sub-par climate efforts before the\nwindow of opportunity to limit\ntemperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C is rapidly\nclosed.\nSCIENCE\nImperial research\nurges climate\nreality check\nScienceWriter\nEMILY WENTWORTH\nSmoke stacks from a greenhouse gas-emitting mining facility.

The original motion brought to Council called Israel\u2019s retaliatory attacks \u2018war crimes\u2019.\nBut Boutrolle asked for the phrase to\nbe removed, arguing that it \u201ccould have\nlegal implications for the Union.\u201d\nNazerali observed that Craig Mokhiber, upon stepping down from his post as\nthe New York director of the UN\u2019s human\nrights body, had called Israel\u2019s actions\ngenocide. Nazerali said that genocide fell\nwithin the definition of a war crime.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the argument is about\nthe definition,\u201d said Boutrolle, \u201cbut more\nthat such language has not been used by\nany official government organisation, so\nwe feel this could lead to big reputational\ncosts.\u201d\nAfter further discussion \u2013 and input\nfrom non-Council members present to\nsupport the motion \u2013 students agreed\nupon \u2018the killing and targeting of civilians\u2019 as a suitable substitute for \u2018war\ncrimes\u2019.\n\u201cSaying nothing is louder\u201d\nTowards the end of proceedings, Silwood\nUnion Treasurer Alex Auyang warned\nCouncil members to \u201cbe cautious about\ntaking political stances, especially given\nHugh Brady\u2019s comments \u2013 him having to\nbacktrack and change his stance based\non different student groups being upset\nat different times.\u201d\n\u2018I don\u2019t know whether this is going to\nupset more students than doing nothing.\u2019\nAuyang\u2019s comments incensed one student observer, who argued that in the\nlight of Brady\u2019s \u201cvery evident bias\u201d and\nsupport of \u201cone side over the other\u201d, the\nUnion had a moral imperative to condemn Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza.\nBringing the discussion to a close,\nNEWS\ncomments, saying they were made \u2018in the\nheat of the moment\u2019, and calling them \u2018a\nlapse for which I sincerely apologise.\u2019\nHe said he knew Dr Zachariah\u2019s family\nfrom his hometown in India. \u2018His father\nis still a good friend of mine.\u2019\nSen said his comments were published\non a private Facebook group of \u2018around\n30 people\u2019, and later made public by\nDr Zachariah \u2013 allegations which Dr\nZachariah denies.\nHe said that he had made the\nantisemitic remarks in response to\n\u2018provocation\u2019 from Dr Zachariah. \u2018Ben\nZachariah called me an alcoholic\u2026 a very\ncruel thing.

LivingOS\nthings we do and the way we do them to\nexchange the life that is for the life that\nought to be. As he writes: \u2018deep down [\u2026]\nshe was waiting for something to happen.\nLike a sailor in distress, she kept casting\ndesperate glances over the solitary waste\nof her life, seeking some white sail in the\ndistant mists of the horizon.\u2019 Madame\nBovary emerged at a time when the romantic genre was being shown the way\nto the exit, and writers were reaffirming\ntheir right to be real (hence: the genre of\nrealism), and thus genuine.\nIt was upon reading this novel that I\nunderstood what Flaubert meant when\nhe said, \u2018Madame Bovary c\u2019est moi\u2019 (trans-lated \u2018Madame Bovary is I\u2019). That is to say,\nhe himself was as much the inspiration\nfor Madame Bovary as anything else, and\nthe tale starts to make even more sense.\nThese notions of romance, ambition,\nand desire have been rebirthed over and\nover in literature and in society, and especially in an environment like Imperial\u2019s. Emma goes to extreme lengths to\nachieve the sort of image she envisioned\nfor herself, based on the fickle aspirations\nborn in her childhood. Not unlike Emma,\nmany of us often build our lives around\nthese things \u2013 our jobs, our friendships,\neven our future aspirations. Moreover,\njust as how Flaubert shows Emma\u2019s desires for love and affluence as fuelled by\nthe cheap romantic literature she read\nin childhood, our own desires in life can\nequally be fuelled by what we\u2019ve seen in\nthe media, and our pride, semblance of\nreputation, and expectations from others\nand ourselves.\nIt is only after reading Madame Bovary\nthat I began to truly appreciate that indeed there is indeed a line to be drawn between loving \u2013 which is active, where we\nembark on uphill battles for things and\npeople out of a true appreciation for them\n\u2013 and being in love \u2013 where we sometimes\nact on an infatuation with an imagined,\nand therefore impossible, ideal, often to\nour own detriment. With Madame Bovary,\nGustave Flaubert advocates for the for-mer, the harder option: the effort of deciding to actually love.\nThis is the first in a series discussing literature as read while on the London Underground.\nI\nmet author Tom Slemen, best known for his Haunted Liverpool series, while in high school, when he visited to talk\nabout the unusual history of Liverpool. His visit to my\nschool in Knowsley, a borough within Liverpool\u2019s city region,\nwas dedicated to sharing the city\u2019s unusual history. The captivating way he told his stories left a lasting impression on me\nin how he spoke with a deep sense of pride for his Liverpool\nroots. This was particularly meaningful considering some of\nthe stereotypes associated with Liverpool. His positive influence shaped my perspective of my city. This passion has once\nagain been captured in his new book, Strange Liverpool.\nBorn and bred in Liverpool, Slemen provides informative\nand convincing evidence on mysterious events that have happened in his hometown, from the past to present, that will\nmake you question your perspective of it. It encouraged me to\nview the city from a slant angle, one that goes beyond conventional perceptions and reveals a mysterious and sometimes\ndarker side to the city.\nWith the support of extensive research, Slemen has written a book that documents strange, but true, occurrences\nthroughout Liverpool\u2019s history. Delivering some truly bizarre\ntales, the book creates an interesting new perspective on the\nhistory of the city through his enthralling narrative.\nA quick read, Strange Liverpool consists of a collection of\nshort stories detailing unusual incidents such as the story\nof \u2018Wild Animals at Large\u2019, which details a chimpanzee\u2019s frequent escapes from Liverpool Zoological Park in 1938.\nSlemen also writes about unsolved mysteries like the \u2018Mass\nGraves in Old Swan\u2019. Old Swan is an area in Liverpool where\n3,561 unmarked coffins were found under a plot of land. No\nrecords were found of the graves in the church beside the mass\nburial site, so some suggest they have been there since before\n1840.\nThis book offers a broad overview of the strange beauty and\nhistory of Liverpool, that allowed even a local like myself to\nlearn something new about my hometown. I would definitely\nrecommend this book to anyone, as it introduced to me events\nthat would have seemed thoroughly unconvincing without\nSlemen\u2019s deft storytelling.\nA chimpanzee going about its day. Hans Hillewaert\nTom Slemen\nand Strange\nLiverpool\nOne of our new Books\nwriters explains their\nattachment to Slemen\u2019s\nwriting.\nBooksWriter\nNATALIE LEWIS\n\n"

One of the big hits LFF had to experience this year was the SAG-AFTRA strike, which left the\nred carpet of the event starless. Throughout the span of\nthe festival, we only saw directors, producers, some of\nthe production teams and only a couple of writers, since\ntheir strike was over by September 27, 2023.\nOther than that, the festival organisation was spec-tacular, all thanks to the amazing team at BFI, all the\nvolunteers, the Pace Prestige security team and the new\nfestival director Kristy Matheson. We will most definitely hear more about the films and series presented at LFF\nin the upcoming year.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n16 | BFI LONDON FILM FESTIVAL 10 November 2023\nW\nhile I am decidedly not a motorcycle enthusiast,\nthe captivating plot of Jeff Nichols\u2019 The Bikeriders\ndrew me in from the very beginning. This film\nis a gritty exploration of the Chicago Vandals motorcycle club set during the rebellious 1960s and early 1970s,\ndelving into themes of\ncompanionship, trust,\nand intricacies of biker subculture\u2019s complex relationships.\nAs director Jeff\nNichols explained\nbefore the screening,\nthis story is based on\nthe work of Danny\nLyon, a photojournalist at the time, who\nplays a crucial role in\nthe film\u2019s storytelling.\nHe doesn\u2019t serve as a\nnarrator, but his interviews control the flow\nof the story.\nThe Chicago Vandals may appear to\nbe a typical motorcycle club, but they\u2019re\nmore than tough guys\nin leather jackets;\nthey\u2019re a close-knit\ngroup, even a family.\nAs viewers, much like\nthe photographer portrayed by Mike Faist,\nwe are gradually initiated into the club.\nThe journey begins with Jodie Comer\u2019s character, Kathy,\nrecalling her first\nencounter with Benny, one of the bikers, portrayed by Austin Butler. Their\nmeeting takes place in a local bar, the Vandals\u2019 resi-dence, where Benny\u2019s silent intensity immediately captures her attention, but the atmosphere is intimidating\nfor her, and she leaves the place in distress, with her\nwhite pants covered in handprints. Soon after, Benny\nfollows, and they spend the night riding around on his\nbike.\nHe\u2019s not a character of many words, and we barely\nhear his voice at first. Benny possesses a silent intensity,\nthat speaks volumes without him dropping a single sen-tence. He even manages to divorce a married couple by\nmerely sitting in front of their house for an entire day.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Austin Butler is a talented actor, but\nthere\u2019s something about him, perhaps his whole Elvis\nsaga, that makes me laugh, even when I see his face in\na serious setting. However, he really manages to portray\nthe mystery of Benny\u2019s character and how unpredictable\nhe is. Troublesome might be an understatement when\ndescribing his character. Yet, beneath his rugged exterior lies a sense of vulnerability and inner turmoil that\nadds depth to his character.\nAlong with Benny in the first scene at the bar, we\u2019re\nintroduced to other members of the Chicago Vandals,\nincluding the man\nhimself, the leader\nof their pack, Johny,\nplayed by Tom Hardy.\nDon\u2019t be fooled by his\nstrong manly appearance \u2013 his voice will\nsurprise you. Similar\nto Benny, this character looks tough, but is\nsoft and vulnerable on\nthe inside. The club is\nhis family, and he will\ndie to protect it. The\nbond between him\nand Benny is much\nstronger than fam-ily, eventually forcing Benny to make a\nchoice between the\ntwo.\nKathy, as Benny\u2019s\npartner, navigates the\nchaotic waters of life\nas the love interest of\na biker. Through her\nstories, we gain deeper insight into this\nwild world of The Bikeriders. Comer\u2019s performance was nothing\nshort of outstanding, I\nwouldn\u2019t be surprised\nif it earns her a nomination or two.\nJeff Nichols captures the essence of the biker family and their unbreakable bonds. After leaving the theatre, I felt I was lacking\nthat kind of feeling. We, as the audience, become emotionally invested in their world, immersing ourselves in\nthe dynamics of their relationships, and that connection\nis the true strength of The Bikeriders.\nRelease Date December 1, 2023\nRunning time 116 minutes\n1\nDEC\nDirected by Jeff Nichols\nWritten by Jeff Nichols\nProduced by Sarah Green, Arnon Milchan,\nBrian Kavanaugh-Jones\nStarring Jodie Comer, Austin Butler,\nTom Hardy, Michael Shannon\nMike Faist, Norman Reedus,\nBoyd Holbrook, ...\nFilmEditor\nMIKE BUZADJI\n\n"
