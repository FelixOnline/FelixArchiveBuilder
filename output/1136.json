This\nproves to be very interesting, as nei ther of them knows what each other is thinking. It's similar in style lo Bridget Jones' Diary by Helen fielding, as it is about the same type of people. Jack Rossitcr is a single, woman eating twenty-seven year old who lives\nwith his best mate in London. He once had a serious relationship but he broke\nit off. However, he has been unable to commit to anyone since. In other words, he' s Just been picking women up for fun. I bet l hal is mos l IC blok es' dream.

Although il is about relationships, il isn'ta romantic novel more a snippet of two peoples' lives.\nHelen\nPANDORA\nby Anne Rice\ncaca caca Effectively the sixth novel in Anne Rice's best-selling Vampire Chronicles, Pandora is the story of a minor character of that name from her earlier books. Born to a noble Roman family two thousand years ago, Pandora grows into a woman of beauty, intelligence and culture. She is\nforced to flee to Antioch during the Emperor Tiberius' purges, where she is\nmade into a vampire by Marius, another character from the Chronicles. After a brief description of the next two millennia as a vampire, the bookends as Pandora leaves for New Orleans to renew her acquaintance with the Chronicles' hero, Lestat.\nThe book is presented a sPan dora's memoirs, written in a modern day Paris cafe, this style is similar to\nmuch of Rice's other work, but more descriptive, sensual and evocative. It's very absorbing, and the characters are\ncomplex and believable. Compared to the earlier Vampire Chronicles, there isn't so much action ( although there is\na fair bit), it is a much more personal journey; a more feminine perspective,\nperhaps( previous narrators have been male). Having read the previous books, all the references to established characters and events were fairly clear,- if\nyou have n't read any of the others,\nthough, Pandora may seem a little\nconfusing. Most of the background to the story is in The Vampire Lcstat. The\nhistorical events in Rome fit nicely with\nthose described in Robert Graves'/ Claudius, which helped since they are\nreferred to but not really explained. They do add nicely to the authentic feel of Pandora' s life, though. Overall, Pandora is a great continuation of the Vampire Chronicles, and a well written, intelligent novel. Although it's not the best intro duc tion to Rice's work, it is almost essential for fans. Out now in hardback is\nthe next story in this s cries, Armand,\nanother character who gets a whole book to himself.\nGareth\n\n"

    "content": "10 15 February 1999\nBritish food has received more than its fair share of crit-ic is m. The problem is typical of this country, rooted in\na view of food for sustenance rather than pleasure. As\nattitudes start to change, we' ve adopted more and more foreign recipes into our diet. But what our native\ncuisine traditionally lacks in flavour, is more than made up in the sheer warmth and wholeness of the food. Even the harshest critics of British food are often still\npartial to a slice of roast meat, a Yorkshire pudding or\na little fruit cake. We now need to take a fresh look at\nBritish cooking. With a little work to avoid the typical\nflavour drain, some of our own food can be really special. Sausages accompanied by mashed potato are great example of a traditional British meal. When made well, it can taste fantastic. Nigel Slater describes perfectly the joy that is b angers and mash, particularly in\nhis latest book Real Food.\nSausages\nI subscribe to the sausage cooking philosophy advocated by Matthew fort of the Guardian. For mc, the only method is to cook them really slowly in a pan. The sausages must be good quality, preferably from a butcher.\nThe method couldn't be simpler. Just put them in\na frying pan over a really low heat, and cook for about\nan hour. Slow cooking means there's no need to pierce the skin. No holes means no loss of juices, but\nthe semi-permeable skin of good sausages does allow\nfat to slowly seep out, forming a fantastic sticky goo that makes the wait totally worthwhile.\nMashed Potato\nSchool mash, made from powder and served with\na scoop. Even now the mere thought makes me cringe,\nso it's strange that proper mashed potato now ranks\namongst my favourite foods. The only essentials are\nCooks\nCorner\nreal potato, and something to moisten it up. Potatoes\ncome in two basic types: waxy, and floury. Igo along with Nigel Slater's verdict that mash is best made from\nthe floury varieties, such as Maris Piper, Desiree or King\nEdwards.\nPeel and chop the potatoes, then boil as usual.\nDrain the pan, then put it back on the heat for a minute or so. this extra drying increases fluffiness. Use\na hand masher to squash the potato, then add the\nextras. I normally stick in some butter and milk. Surprisingly, milk tastes far better than cream in mash. An alternative is to use olive oil instead of the milk and but-ter. Adding chopped parsley or basil makes another\ngood variation.\nOnion Gravy\nA great accompaniment for sausages and mash.\nOnion gravy can have almost as much flavour as meat\ngravy.\n1 large onion about SOg butter\nhalf tablespoon flour\nquarter pint of stock\nWorcestershire sauce\nSalt and Pepper\nMelt the butter in a large saucepan. Peel and chop the onion. Cook slowly with a lid for about twenty\nminutes, until the onion goes really brown. Stick in the\nflour, then cook for a further minute. Add the stock\nslowly, mixing all the time. Season with salt, pepper and\nWorcestershire sauce, then turn down the heat and\nbubble for a further 15.\nNext week: Food to impress\n\u2022*\u00bb\nThere pr+s S; \u2022j^ Mo \u00a3 AL.

Despite the three thousand licensing agreements made between American universities and the private sector, the total income generated am mounts to only two percent of the universities' research budgets. There are currently several companies within Imperial College which promote the exploitation of new break-through s. Imperial College Innovations Ltd was created last year with the By Gareth Morgan\nspecific aim of capital ising on cutting-edge research areas such as bio sensor chips and materials coating technology. However, the view of Lita Nel sen, marketing director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is that\npatent revenue is unlikely to ever become a major source of research\nmoney. Even the biggest money spinning breakthroughs only generate a trickle\nof funding compared to that from sources such as the Higher Education\nFunding Council. Although Britain is looking towards\nthe United States for inspiration on industry funding, the situation there has remained the same for the past\nthirty years: support for basic research\nremains at about seven percent of institutes' research budget. Another problem is that pressure\nto patent research may behaving adverse effects on other activities. Ms Nelson feels that it is important that\nuniversities do not make compromises in order to please private Investorss ome thing which she feels MIT has avoided.15 h'11 Editor: Ed Sexton\n, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 : : \u2022 . \u2022 ' .\n\u2022\n' .News Editor:; Andrew Ofori\n. . . . .\nU'.

The\nfigures were the country's highest in their\nrespective categories and spearheaded the\nsupremacy of London colleges in the salary\nstakes. UCL placed second with 277 staff\nearning over \u00a350,000 and 21 earning above\n\u00a3100, 000. Completing London's sweep was King's in third with 183 people earning\nover \u00a350,000 and6 bringing in over \u00a3100,\n000 last year. The capital's cost of living is\npartly responsible for the top-flight salaries.\nBut many of the highly paid hailed from\nmedical schools and universities strongly\nlinked with industry.\nLondon's dominance has placed pressure on the Oxbridge colleges, amongst\nothers, to enhance their salaries: 115 and121 staff earned over \u00a350, 000 at Oxford\nand Cambridge respectively.\nThe top job at London Business School\nwas the most lucrative vice-chancellor's position they paid the three individuals\nwho filled the role a staggering \u00a3207, 000\npro rata. The LBS also had the country's highest paid academic based at a publicly\nfunded institute, who earned in excess of \u00a3220, 000. Vice-chancellors nation-wide\nprospered last year receiving an average\npay rise of 4.8%, surpassing inflation. Imperial's rector Sir Ronald Oxburgh placed 55th in the country earning \u00a3111,000 in 1997-98.\nThe Association of University Teachers\nwished to see the trend reflected throughout University staff, with their assistant general secretary commenting: 'There is no doubt that vice-chancellors deserve every\npenny, but a university's achievements-depend on all its staff as much as the individual at the top...we don't begrudge vice-chancellors their pay increase but yet again\nthey are paying themselves a far greater\nincrease than they do their staff. We wait\nto hear of a vice-chancellor who refuses to\ntake a bigger pay rise than his staff. We suspect it will be a long wait.\"\nIC completed its copious expenditure\non staff with colossal redundancy pay-offs.\nFour members of staff earning over \u00a350,\n000 a year, received \u00a3338, 000 in compensation for loss of office.\nIn the wake of the HEFCE figures, the\nHouse Of Commons technology committee heard a plea from Sir Keith Peters to\ndouble professors' salaries. Sir Peters, head\nof Cambridge University, suggested an increasing the current professor i ate salary\nfrom around \u00a341, 000 to \u00a380, 000, in order\nto make allowances for moving and setting\nup home. \"Americans just laugh at us\"\nstated Sir Alec Broers, Cambridge vice-chan-cell or as he spoke of how his university was\nunable to attract researchers from industry\nand abroad.

Just when you think\nHollywood is getting its act together and actually making some half-decent\nmovies for once, something comes along to reaffirm your faith in\nHollywood' s fatal flaws. In this case,\nit's Jack Frost, a movie which bases itself on the premise of( brace your self) a man called Jack frost being reincarnated as a snowman, and given one last chance to redeem him self in the eyes of his son. First things first, however. Despite the hideous ethos behind the movie, Keaton, Preston an dAddy{ The Full\nMonty) put in fine performances, and the father-son relationship is surprisingly cheese-free. Surprisingly, how ever, the Snowman itself is dire. What should have been a display of CGI wizardry turns out to be a low-budget tas-tic outing for the traditional blok e in-a foam-suit. Well made and professional as the rest of the movie may look( with some neatly choreographed ski chases and show ball fights), you can't get away from the fact\n21\nHis name's Jack Frost - Just how cruel were his parents?\nthat the lead character is wearing the kind of costume usually found in\nschool pantomimes. Kiddies movie yes,\nbut Toys R Us costumes? I think not.\nDespite the fact that Jack Frost has\n' Christmas holidays' written all over,\nit's being released in February thanks\nto the traditional lag between US and UK release dates - which can only be a good thing, as excessive viewing figures could potentially lead to Jack Frost\n2 - a concept I don't even want to think\nabout. Q Dave Win cinema tickets with the\nKENSINGTON\nDespite the fact that it's not released\nuntil next Friday, This Year's Love has\nalready been touted as this year's Full\nMonty or Four Weddings. However, whilst such comparisons might make you think of an easy going, vaguely romantic, comedy, what you actually\nget is a much grittier slice of life. A cross\nbetween Mike Leigh and Men Behaving\nBadly might be nearer the truth.\nIt's undoubtedly going to be well\nworth seeing, and, thanks to the Odeon Kensington, you can catch it for free. To\npick up a pair of tickets, all you have to do is answer the following question: Which American actress will star\nIn Nottlng Hill, this summer's follow-up to Four Weddings'?\nIf you know, then email your answers to film.felix@ic.ac.uk before Wed nes day evening. The first five names out of\nthe virtual hat will win a pair of tickets.\nI'm sorry for the delay in printing the names of the winners of the Shakespeare in Love competition, but (at last)\nhere they are:\nChiara Manfletti\nMathew Hindley\nTim Rhodes Alex Thackery\nDominic Guppy There were in fact two correct answers\nto the competition - Tom Stoppard wrote\nboth The Fifteen Minute Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildcnstcrn Arc Dead\n- so either movie was accepted. PDATE\nArmageddon\nArmageddon has taken a lot of abuse\nsince its release last August largely\nbecause( thanks to Godzilla and The\nAvengers) every action movie released\nlast summer was decreed poor. However such criticism is unfair as, unlike\nmost of last year's other blockbuster\nofferings, Armageddon delivered what\nit promised big explosions, an all star\ncast, some light relief from Steve\nBus ccm i, some damn impressive CGI\nand effects, and an unremitting mou n tain of cheese. As long as you accept that this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film (translation:\ncheesy, action packed and edited like\nMTV), and rent the video on that\npremise, then you'll enjoy it. After all,\nmovies are supposed to be fun, aren't they?\nKissing A Fool\nPut together three simple components: a bunch of young American writers; a love triangle; and a star of Friends (David\nSchwimmer). A recipe for disaster,\nsurely? Well, surprisingly, no. Admittedly,\nit's not particularly great either, but it's undeniably competent, acceptably\nentertaining, and wittily written. More importantly, considering the time of year, it might be prudent lo suggest this\nas an ideal movie to rent for an evening\nin with your girl/boyfriend (in ol her words it's not totally absorbing, you won't look sad/soppy/adolescent if you rent it, and if everything goes a bit Pete\nTong it's not actually a bad movie).\nPaulie\nHere we go again. Lassie and Flipper\nreally do have a lot to answer for. Babe\nand Free Willywete acceptable, but the\nrecent flood of talking animal based\nmovies begins to grate. This time around the mutant pet in question is the\neponymous Paulie, a fast-talking par-rot, no less. Having 'lost' his first owner\n( young Hallie Kate Lisenberg), he spends the rest of his life attempting to\nfind her again. In actual fact, it's fun,\nknock about stuff, ideal for your little\nbrother (should you happen to be hampered by such an annoyance) - I 've just\ngot a personal vendetta against the\nentire genre. Sorry. D Dave\n\n"

I'm a Third year Physics Student who has done so many things for the union so far. In\nmy first year I was completely apathetic\nand did very little. In my second year,\nhowever, I became involved by be co ming the Duplicating Officer (I was in\ncharge ol ki pr nd ii<'!

And at the same time being involved with\nfinances for several clubs I have had the experience at a lower level.

See how we can improve the services\nrun by the union for you. So to summarise I want to do the\nbest for the union! Ian Clifford\nYou may ask why you should vote for\nIan Clifford. Firstly, I have experience of the Union finance system. As treasurer of the City & Guilds College Union Iwork with clubs& societies, assisting them with budgets, claims and unravelling red tape. I have faced the dreaded Union budgeting rounds and won. I have prepared the finances of the C& GUas a whole. I knowhow the Union runs from a club finances ideas well as the services side. Secondly, I have been a student at Imperial for five years and a member of several clubs including the Mountaineering Club, Pimlico Connection and the Catholic Society. Iwork in the Union Resource Centre, helping both students and union staff - I will be as approachable as a sabbatical like Iam as a member of staff. Personal contact and interest is important in establishing a good working relationship. Next year I aim to: \u2022 Increase communications& training with treasurers \u2022 Open up the union to more students \u2022 Reform funding, payments and standardise subsidies Undergraduate\nFourth Year\nElectrical Eng Department\nPaul Hickman\nUndergraduate\nFourth Year\nChemistry Department\nIam currently in my fourth year at Imperial, and in my time here my involve-ment in the Union has grown from extensive use of the bar facilities to my\ncurrent involvement which includes sitting on the Union House Committee. Iam also an active committee member of\nthe Dramatic Society, which has given\nmc the chance to work closely with many\nclubs and societies throughout the\nUnion. I have particularly enjoyed working as part of the team for Union Carnivals and the Summer Ball. These activities, along with keeping my ear to\nthe ground, have given mca good knowledge of the way the Union is run.\nI believe the Union's trading outlets are\nvital for it to continue to provide the services we all expect of it, while expanding to provide new and improved services\nI expect to encounter some minor problems with Ihe continued merger of the\nMedical school, however I believe I will\nbe able to deal with these, in conjunction\nwith the other sabbaticals, based on the\nprinciple that all clubs should be treated\nequally.\nNext year I intend to: \u2022 Provide training for all clubs officers to\nensure finances are run properly at all lev-els.\n\u2022Improve Union services by ensuring the results of the current focus groups\nare implemented, where possible. If this\nproject is successful then I will look into\nextending it.\n\u2022 Ensure that the policy on subsidy levels is applied fairly to all clubs and soci-e ties. Overall I feel Iam capable of doing the job well, and I would also like to do\nthe job.I believe my experiences will\nallow mc to pick up the day-to-day tasks\nrapidly and then get on with real work that needs to be done to give us all the\nUnion we want.\n\n"

El\nChris\nAlbums\nCASSIUS\nCassius partying like it's1999.T his CD is the result of the ten year partnership between french producers Phillipc Zdar\nand Hubert BlancT ran carl, as well as\nmany other artists they have been the producers of choice for french rap 'star'\nMC Solaar. So there.\nBasically, this CD is chock full of large\nfrench beats, messed up vocal samples\nand the occasionally looped monkey. Phillipe and I lu bert really show off their\nmastery of the 303 beat box with this\nalbum you can hear that distinctive hi-hat on practically every track - this is no bad thing but it does end up sounding rather dated sometimes. But I suppose one man's dated is another man's retro.\nThe album is certainly a mixed bag, with\noccasional tracks sounding post iv ely anno rex ic in their production, and others\nend up so crammed full of beats that\nthey threaten to fuse your speakers.\nCassius don't stray much from the well established 'build it up, knock it\ndown' school of dance mu is ic pro duc tion. They sculpt the beats into a roar of bass and then pull it all away - leaving\nonly a solitary vocal or looped sample.\nWhile they are firmly entrenched in the\nlate '90shappy clapp y house sound, their earlier roots are there for everyone\nto see. With a South Park Chef esqu c sample looped on one of the standout\ntracks of the album, Hey Babe they show their respect for 7 0 s funk which has undoubtedly influenced them a great\ndeal. Most of the beats in the album are\nelectronically generated, but Cassius do deploy varied African percussion and make great use of bizarre samples - as\nwell as the previously mentioned mon key on Invisible, violins are used occassionally but effectively.\nWith sixteen tracks on this album Cassius certainly deliver value for money,\nwhile not every track is quite up to the\ninfectious beats and delicious funk of Ihe\nmonster hit Cassius 1999, there are enough little gems and sou!th umping moments to raise this LI5\nabove the stan-dard. Standout tracks include, Somebody Nulife and the previously\nmentioned Hey Babe and Invisible.\nCassisus are another great band from the French revival that seems to\nhave been happening recently. They join\nDaft Punk and Air as bands to watch in\nthe new millenium1999 is a great way to finish it. EH\nJoel\nTHE KYND\nShakedown \u00a3\nPower pop-ta stic! Jangly guitars!\nNasal vocals! I 've really taken to\nthese guys. This type of music is\nrare these days. The whole album, to\nme at least, is full of pop songs that\nsound like the band want to have fun,\nand they want you to, even more. Let's reminisce over the '60s shall we?\nThe insert to the album doesn't give\nmuch away: no lyrics and only the briefest of acknowledgements and information. However, it docs show that three\nof the band still think the old 'Liam and Noel' haircut (circa 1994) is cool. I think\nwe can forgive them on the grounds that\nthis is one hell of an album. Actually no,\nthat's the wrong phrase; it's more of an exceptional one. I 'll explain: I don't think\nthat The Kynd would like mc to use the\nword 'hell' or any other blasphemous or\nabusive words for that matter. They look\ntoo wholesome and Walton ish, they\ncould be smacked-up to the eyeballs,\nbut if they are they do a good job of hiding it.\nI don't know their influences but I'd bet awad of money that Madchester had\na lot to do with their particular brand of sonic entertainment, along with '60s pop and rock 'n' roll (same as every other\nband, then). But their sound isn't as similar to all those indie bands that have\ngone before them. The first track, World's Finest could be ripped off a Green Day\nalbum, except it's a lot mote musically\nadept, and Green Day wouldn't be caught dead with a tambourine. As we spin our way through the album at a heady 33 1/3 rpm we encounter, intentionally or no, sly winks and clandestine\nnods to a number of other bands of the\nsame ilk. We have a copy of Cast on Almost There which I liked, although Cast irritate me greatly. There's an Inspiral Carpets-c sq uc ditty in Chestnut and a milder version of OCS on If You Think This\nIs Easy... This, along with Egotripperand\nthe beatific, if slightly corny English Girl\nWalking is a stand out track. Three out of\neleven ain't bad. The album as a whole has a full-on hippie revival them about it,\nalbeit with a contemporary twist. Ihe\nideals are there but there's a modern feel\nmixed into that retro catch in ess. This, it\nhas to be said, is a good thing. H Christian\n\n"

Stef Evans\nBio chem II\nIQ Sec\nDefend Free Education\nDear Felix,\nLast week I read an article in the excellent electronic newspaper, SchNEWS,\nwhich I have to share with you. The subject is close to all our hearts, our e duca tion. In this country we have seen what\namounts to the privatisation of our edu cation system by the implementation of\npolicies such as the nation curriculum in\nschools to the tailoring of degree courses\nin universities to the needs of business\nand industry, not people or the planet.\nThis year we have seen the the governments' latest nail in the coffin of e duc ation for all, tuition fees are now a reality.\nYet we are not alone, other governments\nhave also been 'reforming' the education\nsystems in their countries. However, these reforms are attracting so much more resistance abroad then in Britain\nthat it puts us to shame. In Greece, pupils and teachers have\njoined forces to oppose the implementation of the2525/97 Act which seeks to\nlink education directly to the needs and fluctuations of the economy. The Act,\nintroduced nearly a year ago and billed\nas \"a broad reform of the education syst em\" means, in reality, intensification of Science and Maths\nTutors Required\nScience and Maths tutors required in\nLondon and the Home Counties.\nGraduates only\nTop rates.\nTel 0181 349 2148\n(Top Tutors Agency)\nthe curriculum, rivalry between schools\non the basis of the education offered\nand total loss of free class discussion\ntime for pupils. First to react were the\nteachers, culminating in four days of serious rioting in many Greek cities in\nNovember. Pupils then occupied over\n1000 schools in December. The government hoped the kids would 'get it out of\ntheir systems' by the time of the Christmas holidays arrived. No such luck, come mid-January 800 schools were still occ u pied. The government began prosecuting pupils and a wave of threats and terror began to spread.\nStarting on January 15th, demonstrations swept almost every Greek city,\nin Athens, where25,000 people protested, 14 arrests were made with\nheavy charges centred on two people, Arban Belala, a17 year old Albanian and Vasilis Evangelidis, a30 year old anarchist\nand unemployed teacher. They denied all charges and got put on remand for\ntheir troubles. On January 19th, as demos and riots continued to sweep the co un try, Vasilis announced, \"What is most\nimportant today is the continuation of the struggle, the solidarity with the occ u pied schools and the coming together\nand the communication of all people in\nstruggle.\" And the struggle has continued, on the 21st January, over 40 activists\nwere arrested, mostly in Athens and Patras, and bailed until le bru ary. Ihe\ndemos show no signs of abating.\nMeanwhile, back in England, \"I think\nit's very reasonable. It's a fair market\nprice,\" was the comment made by a Lond on School of Economics student on tuition fees. Why not take a leaf out of the Greek schoolbooks and do some thing to defend our education system\ninstead of sitting back and letting it\nbecome closed off to all except those\nable to pay for it.\nB.

    "content": "20 15 February 1999\nReviews\nHideous Kinky \u2022 \u2022\nStarring : Kate Winslet, Said Taghmaoui, Bella Riza, Carrie Mullan\nDirector: Gillies MacKinnon\nKate trades In posh frocks for cute kids.\nK ate Winslet's first movie after\nTitanic ought to be a massive\nblockbuster, for which she'll pocket several million, right? Wrong it's a low budget Brit Flick, which aims to ape the success of Saharan set romances like The English Patient. Hideous Kinky\ncontains elements of a thousand different British movies, all tied together in a seventies-set, retro-styled package.\nYet despite the obviously promising premise, it's painful to watch. Never before has a96 minute movie managed to feel so long - we're talking Dances With\nWolves levels of numbing tedium. The\ncinematography is undeniably good, but\nwhilst the first few panoramic sweeps across the Moroccan wastelands produce\na sense of a we, the seventieth identical\nshot simply serves to make you aware of how static the movie actually is.\nThe real problem, however, is the simple lack of plot. As the movie opens, Winslet is struggling to.make ends meet in Marrakesh, having left her upper-class\nEnglish origins behind her when her husband deserted her. So, she scrapes a living by selling dolls in the market, whilst\nsimultaneously attempting to bring up her\ntwo children, played by Riza and Mullan\n-whose favourite words are (according to\nthe press notes) 'hideous' and 'kinky'.\nHowever, despite an outward pretence of\nhappiness, none of them are happy -until help arrives in the form of the mysterious Taghmaoul - playing a charismatic\nlocal worker called Bilal ... and that's about it. They travel back and forth across\nIndistinguishable plots of desert (until\nyou lose all interest in where they actually are), losing and finding each other in\nan entirely predictable way, but, in a nut-shell, that's the entire plot.\nIndeed, so uneventful is the movie\nthat the only question it raises is why Winslet chose to make it at all. (True, she met her husband James Threapleton on set, but she was hardly to know that\nwhen she signed the contract). If It's an\nattempt to avoid typecasting, then it's a damn good one but it's also a pretty fast\nroute to being entirely forgotten by Hollywood. Indeed, fans of Winslet, queen-of-costume-drama (Titanic, Hamlet, Jude,\nSense & Sensibility) will hardly recognise\nthe weathered, tanned actress they see\non screen.\nNonetheless, she( and indeed all of the other stars) still turn in decent, competent performances. Yet none of them do anything more; the basic problem with Hideous Kinky is that it contains\nnothing that brings the screen to light.\nHaving secured a star and a nice location,\nthe production crew seem to have shut-up shop and decided that any more work\nwould be superfluous. And sadly, the box-office receipts will probably bear out\nthat decision, fl\nDave\nA Night at the Roxbury *\nStarring : Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan, Chazz Palminteri, Molly Shannon, Dan Hedaya, Richard Grieco.\nDirector: John Fortenberry, Peter Markle\nMovies based on Saturday Night Live sketches tend to be somewhat hit and miss.\nWe' ve had the brilliant( Wayne's World, Blues Brothers) and the dismal( Coneheads, It's Pat). Many of the stars themselves have gone on to become members of the Hollywood elite ( Dan Ackroyd, Billy Crystal, Mike Myers etc). So is A Night at the\nRoxbury in the same league? Er, no. Definitely, absolutely, positively not. Let's look at the evidence. Firstly,\nit's based around the American club scene. Now, If this movie has any sense of accuracy at all. It's nothing like it is here and consequently Ferrell and Kattan's geeky behaviour sim ply doesn't transfer. Secondly, we' ve seen this kind of thing a million times before just checkout the morning schedule on Channel Four during the school holidays. Thirdly, and most conclusively, look at the soundtrack listing:\nWhere do you go my lovely( No\nMercy), Disco Inferno( Cyndi Lauper),\n\"What Is love, baby don't hurt me...\". That's right. It's a Now 6 soundtrack. Help.\nPop M uzi k(3 rd Party) - and above all\nthis, the recurring theme of 'What is\nLove' by Haddaway. All of which would be OK if this was set in some kind of kitsch, 80's retro world but it isn't, it's present day. Please God, no. Ultimately, however, the real problem with A Night at the Roxbury is\nthat it simply isn't funny. Only once during the entire film did the preview audience laugh( if you don't include the stifled guffaws every time Haddaway started to play) - and that was when it became apparent that the entire final scene had been lifted from Jerry Maguire. The problem may well be that the humour doesn't translate;\nor maybe we suffer because hardly\nanyone in the UK watches Saturday\nNight Live (just imagine a US audience going to see a movie version of a Harry Enfield sketch). More likely,\nhowever, is that it's due to the common problem of trying to force two minutes of material into ninety minutes of celluloid. Whatever the answer is, however, the net result remains the same a comedy that you' ll laugh at, not with. And that's A Night at the Roxburys\none saving grace it's so phenomenally bad that it's funny. Bring back Chevy Chase, all is forgiven. Q Dave\n\n"

    "content": "15 February 1999 Comment 5\nThe Audible Conscience\nWeek after week I wake up to the shrill,\ndemented, electronic wailing of my cheap plastic alarm clock. I crack open my eyes and am greeted by the feeble glow of sunlight perm eating my thin, nylon curtains, blotted out by the\ndwarfing concrete constructions of the City and the\nsmoggy haze of pollution suspended in the atmosphere. Outside, processions of aggressive cars rake\nthrough the streets. Exhaust fumes circulate thickly\nin the air and loom over the city like a mocking halo. I he pavements arc densely cluttered with flocks of people herding to work. People leap across the road through gaps in the unyielding t raf fic, rejoining the crowd of pedestrians on the opposite side. It's always the same crowd Is ec here but never the same faces. All of them are hurrying to go somewhere but none ever get any-where,- for surely enough it'll be there again tomorrow: the same crowd with many faces walk ing, rushing, crowding, shoving and crushing all so that they can do it again the day after, and the day after that. All sharing that same mindlessly determined gait.\nIdo always recognise one face. Dressed in a grey, woollen overcoat with his arms huddled across his chest to hold it close, he trudges endlessly around Kensington. His face is smudged with the leaded and sooty dust of the city. His\nwaist-long, thickly matted and deteriorating grey\nhair resembles a worn and dishevelled carpet. I have never once seen him stop to rest, speak or\nask for anything. I expect he will be dead before the end of winter. And all around me the streets of the City live\non; crawling and heaving with the oppressive and suffocating population. We live like rats in an over-crowded cage that snap and tear at each other and then trample their wounded. Climbing Ihe economic ladder has become everything; road rage is\ncommon news,- some people arc robbed, run over\nand killed; others arc left for dead, living on the streets. In this glorified concrete slum humanity has long ago seeped through the drainage grating and into the sewer. We are so absorbed in the endless nurturing of our brave new world that we must leave il up to the homeless, cynics and outcasts to truly admire it. The result has been mass urbanisation: an unnatural, unreasonable, polluted, overcrowded, in human and repulsive crea tion. There is no sanity to be found here. People who live here have become too blind, deaf, numb or ignorant of their environment to care about it.\nThe only way they can get through a day of their\nlife without the inconveniences of conscience and humanity is by persuading themselves that our world is Ihe only way; lh at anybody who tries to\ntell them that the world can be made better is an idealist, a dreamer, cynical, an extremist, a red, naive, unrealistic or just mad. It is the greatest tragedy of this world this final solution that but\na minority appear to be aware enough of the world in which we live to care enough lo change it or even acknowledge thai it should be changed. Ih rough out history and on into the present Ihe\nfoundations of society, our views and our values continue to shift like deserts and s, if only we make them. Every voiced dissent, every awakened mind, every inspired opinion, every gesture and every deed will move them and influence what they will become. But the world is thick with the stench of apa thy, and it appears that all you will let little change in the near future. In the mean lime our gene r ation may look forward to when this will all be ours. Each of us will be spending everyday of our meaningless existence burning up our lives in\norder to keep up with everybody else. Each of us\nwill be no more lhan a fart in the ventilation.

This\ntime it's Julian Cope, formerly of the early eighties band The Teardrop\nExplodes - a solo artist since '83 and an egotistical and a supposed self indulgent flawed genius, if ever there were one. The title of the album is that of a track from the 1991 album Peggy Suicide.\nThe album covers the two phases that\nCope spent signed to Island Records,\ntor those not familiar with his music,\nCope goes for the self absorbed sadness\nlike the Smiths, add some synthesisers\nand the odd experimental bit here and there, and that's it.\nThe early part of the album covers\nPhase One,/9861988 and is a bit of a mix. My personal favourites arc the catchy Trampoline and the Smiths-like\nCrazy harm Animal. Apart from these,\nonly .Charlotte Anne stands out as good material whereas the experimental Transporting just smacks of pure self-indulgence. The latter part of the album. Phase Two,19911992 is dire. There is a fine line in music between eccentricity\nand bad taste and I think that Cope sprinted across it sometime during the late eighties.\nI can only think that this has been released to jump on the'80 s revival\nbandwagon. Whether designed for nostalgia or to catch a new generation - as\nthe title does suggest, frankly, it's a waste\nof money. I lis two existing greatest hits\npackages are much more selective. In all,\nthis album does more to put people off\nlistening to Julian Cope than lo get you to buy his back catalogue. Currently\nunsigned to a record label, he really\nshould give up and go home.

Cot\nDefarl - he's focused dally.\nRecently San Francisco and LA\nhave been the hot areas for\nfinding the 'next big thing' as far\nas hip-hop is concerned, spawning Jurassic 5 and numerous other fine, raw talent collectives. And as far as DJing\ngoes these areas have been the most\nforward thinking as well, producing some of Ihe most innovative scratch-ing, beat displays, and pleasing melodies in hip-hop at the moment. Defari is one of the new breed of West\nSide rapper, whose talent has been honed free styling at house parties and\nMC ing for fun. His voice is nothing special but his lyrics flow smoothly, with\nassurance, occasionally sounding like\nRakim; on a bad day!!\nThe sound of the album is typical\nWest Coast hip-hop, much more fresh\nand open than the clouded NY sound with excellent scratch displays that are\nnot too over the top. Often the melody is basic, layered over an intense beat,\nthat can be quite infectious. Overall the\nproduction is slick, from time to time the\nsound can be quality through and through, at others it is basic. This gives\na good feel to the album so that one doesn't get too sick of the over smooth, rich sounds. Defari also has a few famous friends to help him out on his\nrapping talc, Xzibit, Tha Alkaholiks and Phil Tha AgonyTo mention but a few.\nfocused Daily is not a bad album though it's certainly not amazing. There\nare a few good tracks on it but nothing really stands out. If you like West Coast\nhip-hop focused Daily Is a good buy otherwise I'm afraid that Defari on the strength of this album will fade into the\nswarm of other undistinguished rappers\nwaiting for that one single that will\nlaunch him to stardom.

With Leicester packing their\ndefence we found it very difficult to create a scoring chance and although 2-1\nwas a disappointing result the opposition\nprobably deserved it.\nWith minutes to go, the sun broke\nthrough the clouds, reflected off the Medallion of Joy and temporarily blinded\nStout Stout, allowing the2 nd scum( how rude!) to slip through and slide one past\nPete Tong, who was unfortunately busy\nmixing his essential selection at the time.\nBut the Disco Squad was un bowed, and Lager Lager broke down the left wing, showed a bit of fire and the rest of the boys saw that it was the way forward. 2\nminutes later we were slapping the ball\nabout in their D, Chopper swooped in\nand the boy of joy made it 1 - 1 . Top\nBanana!\nAnd so penalties were to decide who was to continue on the path of glory, and who was to be consigned to the depths of derision and general piss\ntaking. Top marks must go to our goalie\nPete Tong, who displayed flair and panache and also saved 2 p flicks.\nCasanova, Baps and Fabio all scored, with The Sundance Kid and Indian Cowpat Category settling for moral victories.\nThe 2nds only managed to slip one past\nour mighty Tong and so must bow out\nas honourable losers.\nCOME ON THE THIRDS ARE GOING ALL\nTHE WAY, BABY!

    "content": "4 News 15 February 1999\nStudents Revolt Against Indonesian Turmoil\nBy Marc Broster\nIndonesia was badly affected by the1997 economic crisis, wages were cut\nand the price of essential items increased hugely,- prices by 3 8 % , train\nfares by50%, chicken by86%. tor Indonesia's working class (86 million people), the crisis meant un employ ment, starvation and homelessness. A revolution was led by students, followed by the country's workers,- in January 1998\nthere were widespread strikes, followed by student protests. On12 May six students were shot by troops in Jakarta,\ncausing further riots, and student demonstrations. The army attacked students in the streets but could not stop\nthem occupying the parliamentary build-ing.\nSuharto, who came to power after\na coup in 1965 that killed over half a million people, resigned as a result of the people's actions. However, there were few changes, since he was replaced by his deputy BJ Habib ie. The fight fot democracy will continue. On Thursday 4 February, Imperial's Socialist Worker Student Society and Environmental Society hosted a group of students from Indonesia who are active\nin the organisation that has been integral to the struggle against the regime in Indonesia. The students are touring Britain to raise awareness of their cause,\nand Felix was able to ask one of the students some questions after the talk.\nFelix: What drives you to carry out your\nfight?\nWhen you have a consciousness you have to give all your energy to it. The\npeople of my country supported me in\nthe past, so it is my obligation to do this.\nFelix: How did you begin to organise the\nrevolution?\nWe have a tradition of organisation in\nthe university, so we have established\nan atmosphere where social and political problems are always being dis-cussed. Almost every year we organised\nlittle strikes, which is why when the crisis really began to bite the strikes\nerupted more regularly. We organised when the new students came to the campuses every new term, by showing them the oppression which exists in\nIndonesia. We organised big discussions and after about a month of edu cation we broke up into small discussion\ngroups. The raw materials of the movement came from these groups. Felix: What do you discuss?\nEverything, we discuss national issues\nand conditions and we have ideological\ndiscussions to educate students in Marxist ideas on politics and economics. We stood for the student council and used\nthose positions to organise. In May we argued that students had to build links\nwith the urban poor and with workers.\nWe won that argument on our campus, and people came to address our mass\nmeetings. Felix: Are there any problems In your\norganisation?\nWhen it was announced that Suharto\nhad stepped down there was im medi ate jubilation. But then a section of the\nstudents argued that Habibie's appoint-ment should be welcomed because he was a good Muslim. Others were not\nhappy that Habib ie had been made president. When the universities go back\nin August we expect this process of polarisation to grow. It is important that\nwe continue to build on the campuses. Felix: Are you scared?\nYes, of course, we're just normal people,\nten of my close friends have been in jail\nsince 1996, and twenty of my friends are\nmissing.\n*\u2022 \\ v N\\''* \u201e\u201e f Borneo >\nIndian Ocean\nKalimantan f4/ Ujunrgpandang' ,\n\u00bb '-fS\nNorth\nPacific\nOcean\nPAPUA\nUlan\n.\u2022'VusrMua, J Inaugural\nIC MEDICS SUMMER BALL date: 24th June 1999\nvenue: Cobham, Surrey\ntime: 2pm till 6am1 Tickets on reserve "

    "content": "Teddington Faces Axe: Cobham Next?\nA new College report threatens a radical\nshake-up of student sports provision, and ultimately suggests the sell-off of two of\nImperial's three sports grounds.\nThe report, based on a survey of sports\nusage from September 1997 to December\n1998, recommends that \" the College should aim to cater for the outdoor sports\nat one location\". This would almost certainly result in Harlington becoming home to all club sport, as it is the only ground with the capacity to cater for all of IC's needs.\nHowever, whilst gravel extraction continues at the Heathrow site (which is\nscheduled for at least the next six years),\nadditional space will be required. Thus, at\nleast one of the other grounds will earn a short-term reprieve. The report notes that\na total provision of around90 acres is\nrequire; at present, Harlington provides 50\n(a further 35 will be released when quarrying is complete), Cobham adds a further\n50 acres, whilst Teddington provides only\nBy David Roberts\nPhoto: Felix Archive\n12.5. Consequently, it is widely believed\nthat Teddington (historically home to St\nMary's sport) has already been earmarked\nfor sale. Moreover, Teddington is un doubt IC Sport - heading for Harlington?\ned ly the most attractive venue for prospective buyers, lying as it does in the centre\nof a large residential estate - which also\nmeans that, unlike the other two grounds,\nthere is no potential for further develop-ment. Ihe only real point in its favour\nwould seem to be that it is the cheapest\nground to run, with a budge led deficit of\n[42 000 this year (compared with [43 500\nfor Harlington and[101380 for Cobham).\nOn a brighter note, however, the\nreport also recommends that the switch in\nfocus to a single ground should allow \"the\ndevelopment of a full range of high quality sports facilities\", including an improved\npavilion and a much broader range of all-weather and floodlit pitches.\nI he report was due to be discussed at\nlast Fhursday's meeting of College Athletics Committee, and although the outcome\nwas not known as Iclix went to press,\nsenior Union sources suggest that the\nsale of Teddington is now almost certain.\n\"As far as College is concerned, we don't need Teddington - and they're obviously\nnot going to ignore the massive amount\nof money that the sale would generate...it\nwon't be long before Cobham goes too\".\n\"Lucky\"\nA student who fell from the first floor of the Union into the foyer escaped with\njust a broken wrist. Ihe incident, which occurred late in the evening of Friday 5\nFebruary, is the first of its kind for several\nyears, but has still raised Issues c once r ning stewarding procedure at Union events.\nThe accident happened sometime around 1.30am. when Union stewards\nwere attempting to clear people out of the upper rooms of the Union. The stu-dent, a first year undergraduate, was reportedly attempting to slide down the banister of the stairs by the Union Dining\nHall. According to eye-witnesses, he rapidly lost his balance, and fell approximately 5 m to the concrete floor below, landing on his right hand side. Miraculously he did not hit the stairs or any other\nobject on the way down. Stewards responded to the situation rapidly, calling\ncollege security and an ambulance. Paramedics arrived at around1.50 am and Fall For\nBy Ed Sexton\nPhoto: I he daunting drop\nFirst Year\nasked for the event to be closed, resulting in the Union being emptied five minI ute s earlier than usual. The injured\nI student was taken to hospital and released around three hours later, after\nhaving his wrist put in plaster.\nMark Home, Lnls and Marketing Manager, described the student as\n\"incredibly lucky... we're glad it wasn't more serious\". He also mentioned that\nthe student appeared to be \"under the\ninfluence\" of alcohol. Ihe accident has\nnecessarily raised concerns over safety.\nIan Oillett, Safety Director for the col-leg e, has been in contact with the Union and has discussed whether further safety\nprecautions need to be taken. He agreed\nwith Mr Home that \"to end up with a broken wrist is extremely lucky\". Ihe most\nlikely change is that a second steward will\nbe brought up to the first floor when the\nUnion Dining Hall is being cleared in\norder, as Mr Gillctl put it, \"to monitor\nbehaviour on the staircase.\"\nInside..\u2022\nComment -tuc ay 5\nLetteFS - Request for info 6\nEditorial & Valentines history 7\nColumns - Cooking8 Valentines Messages12 Manifestoes -14 of them 14\nFilm - Competition20 ArtS & book reviews 22\nMUSiC - Defari album review 24\nClubSCene - Mass26 GameS - Natural Fawn Killers 28\nSpOrt & Diversions 30\nCrOSSWOrd sim no prize 32\n\n"

Somehow the medics woke up and got\npast Baldrich and Miranda and man aged to run into 'keeper Flo giving them a penalty. They put in another and IC sat\ndown at half time to some talk on tactics from captain Slave.

Greenwich, ranked second in the BUSA\nSouth West Division, was far from a match for the IC men's basketball team. For the first knock-out of the BUSA Championship, IC, without performing well,\nonly had problems for about 20'. Even\nthough a home match, the tie had to be played at the Union gym of Queen Mary\nas there was no court available to IC for\na Wednesday fixture. The match started\nwith IC taking a small lead of 4-8 points.\nHowever, the bad rebound record of the forwards and the low percentages of\nthe guards allowed Greenwich to finish\nthe half ahead(3229). As soon as the second half started IC tightened their\ndefence, eventhough the offence remained problematic. The result was that a difference of about ten points\nwas secured and this was to remain until\nthe end, despite the last-minute efforts\nby the Greenwich guards. In the average-to-bad general performance of IC, Sasa\nBjelogrlic, Adam Winton and the Captain,\nTheodore M our out is offered, in comparison, the more reliable solutions.\nA lot of things need to be improved if IC\nare to win their second knock-out away\nto Oxford Brookes. The inclusion of Stefano Bondi, a new2.05 m center, in the\nsquad, as well as the return of Elias 1\n1 lad Is\nafter a two-week absence due to illness\npromise significant strengthening of the\nteam near the basket. If at least some of\nthe guards can have a good day in\nOxford on Wednesday, IC have a good chance to be in the BUSA finals for the\nfirst time ever.

The\nexhibition itself is not much of a stretch\nfor McQueen who sticks to what he knows best; using novel camera angles\nand projections to cast new light on his\nsubjects.\nNowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than in \"Drumroll\", a triple screen\nfilm of a barrel being rolled by McQueen down the streets of Manhattan. We view\nthe journey out of both ends of the bar-rel, from an eccentric position, and looking radially from the surface of the barrel.\nWhile the film does prove interesting in\nhighlighting the number of circular objects\nthat one encounters when travelling\ndown a street, and serves as an excellent\nillustration of the motion of a point on the\ncircumference of a rolling circle, which you may have been contemplating since\nyour GCSE physics classes, once the quasi-novelty of the camera placement wares\noff one is left with the feeling that nothing new has really been accomplished. The same is true of the other film\ninstallation, \"Deadpan\". McQueen recreates the classic Buster Keaton scene where he is spared from being crushed\nunder a falling wall by a conveniently\na silent four and a half minutes of slow accurate measurement?) there was not a motion black and white. Only once do we lot lo take home after the initial novelty,\nsee McQueen flinch as the wall speeds But maybe that's exactly the- point\nMcQueen shows no emotion in spite of\nevents, no anticipation and no relief, and\nthe viewer therefore has nothing to relate\nto on an emotional level.\nAll in all, the exhibition isn't going to\nradically alter the way you view the world,\nbut for a pound it's worth a look. At least\nat the end of your visit you'll feel that little bit more urbane for just having entered\na gallery and your engineer friends will be\nimpressed with your level of sophistication\nor not.\nThe exhibition is open until 21 March\nand associated events include several\ngallery talks and a special one day conference on the meaning of political in the\ncontext of contemporary art.\nRussell\nUntil 21st March located window( we've all seen it).

How fitting that Grace Theatre\nshould choose to put on a double bill\nabout infidelity and betrayal. In 'The\nStronger' I was unfortunately distracted\nfrom the theme by Mrs X's teetering fur\nhat. It was hard to ignore because although there were two other characters\non stage ('Miss Vand the waiter) she had\nall the lines - yes, this was a monologue. It also occured tome how well I could\nplay the part of Lmile in The sound of silence'. It goes something like this:\nEnter stage right wearing tuxedo, drunk. Girlfriend rants about you not phoning. Ignore her. Goto bed. Read\nnewspaper. Smoke a cigarette. Goto sleep for Vi hour while girlfriend rants on.\nAnd on. And on. Get up. Put on trousers.\nExit stage right to go out drinking.\nThis play was a monologue too. A singer talks herself to despair in front of\nher insensitive, sometimes sleeping lover.\nQuite similar to 'The Stronger' where a betrayed wife talks herself to despair in\nfront of her husband's mistress.\nBoth ladies in the Stronger were immaculately dressed in the style of the\nturn of the century Christmas shopper -all mink coats and fur hats - as befits this\nperiod melodrama. A commanding performance from Christina Greatrex drew\nsome attention away from her misbehaving head-piece which, despite her\nbest efforts, eventually slid away to reveal\na non-period hair style.\nI like fringe venues because they\nusually allow drinks in the auditorium, so\nif the action becomes less than interest-ing, one can always pick up one's Guin ness and appreciate that instead. I found myself doing this several times. To trek all\nthe way to Clapham lo see this was slightly disappointing. Although the prog ram me boasted about the Shakespearean pedigree of the performers, I thought something was slightly lacking.\nlain\nUntil 11th February\nLatchmere pub, 503 Battersea Park Road\nClapham Junction BR\nTickets: concessions \u00a37\nPerformance times: Tuesday - Saturday\n8 pm, Sunday 4.30pm Brett Donovan spoke to the ICSM cast of\nBlood wedding after watching them in\nrehearsal.\nAfter much deliberation, ICSM opted for\nthe production named Blood Wedding. After many successful productions including Shakespeare, it was thought apt to play this Spanish Tragedy. What\nmakes Blood Wedding stand out from Shakespeare is perhaps that is less nebulous and somewhat shorter than Shakespearean affairs with only three acts.\nA tragedy, lede rl co Lorca's play mirrors a true story that took place at Almeria in 1928 . Ihe title hints at the plot. This\nis no ordinary marriage - the bride is\ncaught between the man she wanted to\nmarry (Leonardo), with whom she feels\nexhilarated and exciting, and her bride-groom to be. a safe and dependable character. Leonardo marries another woman as a result of family feuding. Adulterous passion flows between Leonardo and the bride to be, with the\nresult that the bride leaves abruptly at\nthe ceremony with Leonardo. Incidentally, Leonardo is the only named character in the play.\nCentral to the play is Ihe notion of fate and heredity. In the emotional struggle how will the passions and impulses\nfair against the social conventions? How will the struggle with bad blood end?\nthroughout there is much symbol ism, both in terms of characters played\nand some of the more latent ideas, lor example two characters play the roles\nmoon and death. Blood Wedding is directed by Rosie\nBeal-Preston, a1 st year clinical medic. An\nexperienced actor, she is certainly accustomed to treading the boards, and the\ncast in form mc that she is an excellent\nand accomplished director. She has aimed to be as faithful to the original\nmeaning as possible, unlike other interpretations which lend to bias toward\nthe sexual aspects.\nBeing a preview I was not allowed\nto know the ending. But I have an inkling of what may be in store, probably involving a bloody finale, but for\nwho m?I now have to attend the whole performance, if only for completeness. However with the time and effort\nexpend in addition to the skill of the cast\nand directors, I doubt it will be anything\nother than a success.\nBrett\nPerformances: 1 7 , 1 9 and20 th February\n\n"

The only group for which there\nwas any increase at all - with a0.4% increase in numbers that is more than\naccounted for by the rise in actual population is the under-21's from the UK;\napplicants from every single other group\nhave fallen in absolute terms. The\nbiggest falls have been in engineering and the sciences - Civil, Electrical and Electronic Engineering applications have\ndropped over 11 % ; Physics applications\nfell 10.3 % , and even 'sexy, trendy' Biology has been hit, with applications falling\n3.4 % . Ihe biggest drop - over 20 % - is\nin Computer Science and Software Engineering, while Business and Management studies is still by far the most popular subject.\nImperial College, particularly, has been hit with an overall decrease in\napplications of4.8% with a19.3% decrease in overseas applications, doubtless precipitated by the economic crisis\nin the Far East.\nCash for Qualifications\nSeveral IC students were startled last\nmonth to receive a spam message via\nemail essentially offering a degree, admittedly from a non-accredited uni-vers it y, for payment.

Although Mr Luck\nattempted to restrain the burglar, he escaped, dropping the loose change he had picked up, and ran away down I ul-ham Road. Fortunately, nothing was taken, although Mr Luck was left bruised\nby the encounter.\nCollege security was quick to arrive\non the scene and the police arrived\nrather later.

    "content": "28 Games 15 February 1999\nNatural Fawn Killers aka NFK (PC)\nJanuary has really been a tad too quid for\nthis reviewer. Perhaps SimCity 3000 and Alpha Centuri will be in the shops by the time that this review hits the lecture the-at re, but apart from these small bright\nlights the only creatures stalking the game shops have been compilations or\nworse still, the B Game. Natural fawn Killers has B game written all down its\nspine.\nfollowing the beaten trail that Deer,\nDuck and Grizzly Hunter have stalked,\nNatural Fawn Killers tries to inject a slight amount of humour into the\notherwise dead pan hunting game.\nUnfortunately in the same way the\nNational Lampoon team attempts to\nparody American film genres, NFK\nhas hammed it up too much and included too little meat. The hunter\ngames captured the interest of the\nBritish public in the same way a flat-^ mate's genital warts capture one's interest - they might well be out\nthere but you sure didn't want to experience the pain of even seeing them. To play the hunting games properly\nrequired the player to do very little for\nmost of the time. Stalking and making animal noises ap cars to pretty much sum up most of it. NFK is much more inter-est ng for the first few minutes, but the\nsimplicity and limited nature of the game play soon bring your interest levels back\nto catatonic. Forget having to stalk the\nprey, this is much more like a Doom situation - run things down and shoot\nat short range. There is a telescopic\nlens option on the hunting rifle for\nsniping at creatures, both big and small, though this is mostly a waste\nof time. Shooting creatures from distance should be what this game is about. Unfortunately smaller creatures seem to ignore you until you get almost close enough to stomp on them rather than scar per away.\nAs for attempting to take on larger\ncreatures with the hunting rifle is Ihe\nsimplest way to get chomped or\nstomped on yourself.\nAs far as the graphics go at least\nthey have 3 D acceleration card\noptions to produce polygon graph-ics, but incredibly uninteresting and simplistic polygon ground and river\ngraphics. Fven the polygon animals\nwere not as impressive as could be expected. The rabbits were very sim-ple, though at least they had managed to draw and animate a fawn with\na little more detail, though it does look\nremarkably like Bambi in appearance. The sound is on the same level; for\nmovement there is the choice or either\ncrunchy leaf, crunchy ground or sloshing\nwater sounds.\nDespite loathing most of this game name sly the simplistic gam c play, the graphics and the sound there were things which were slighly better. The\nhumour, though sick, carries the game for a few minutes. Shooting creatures at close range produces aortic\nspurts of blood, or if you get a good enough shot on the smaller animals an instant decapitation - now I told you it was sick. There is also\nthe ability to waste a series of small\nfurry and large scaly creatures using\nnot only a hunting rifle, but gat t ling guns, grenade launchers even rocket launchers. Rabbit problems.\nJust drop a bomb near them. The only other saving grace was the\ncomplete lack of a made up story. No p retention of a quest or a task, just a simple shooting game. Unfortunately even\nthis can not really compensate for what\nis a very poor game. What ever you do do not buy this game, and even the\nwalk to your local rental outlet might not\nbe worth it - especially if it's cold, far\naway, or you have to actually have to pay\nlor it.\nGary S Depressed - No one loves you! At least there are more Previews\nSid Meiers - Alpha Centuri\n, 1 , \\ ./\nSid Meier has generally had the Mid as touch in producing strategy games. Civilization and Civ 2 were responsible for\nthe loss of millions of work and home hours throughout the western world. Their friday afternoon projects Masters\nof Orion and MOO2 were less perfect,\ncontained some nice touches in that\nyour offensive and defensive weapons could be modified, so a fleet of fast,\nlightly armed ships could attempt to\ntake on a heavily armed death start hough usually without anything like the success\nenjoyed in the movies.\nSo Sid is about to give\nbirth to Civilization 3, or\nbecause of his split with\nMicroprose, Alpha Centuri\n(Microprose kept the rights\nto the Civ name). Set on the first colony out in\nspace - the peaceful en ding to Civ and Civ 2, where you take command of one of many factions of the original colony ship and attempt to lead them to domination of\nthe planet - either by diplomacy, by\necomonic ally out producing your opponents, or by old fashioned genocide. Expect heavily revamped graphics, Al\nand the inclusion of a custom weapon platform editor.\nBest of all, there is an internet server\nbased multiplayer option. Now you can\nattempt to plot your way to the top against organic, intelligence. Time to test\nplans of global domination on the rest of the world.\nSimcity 3000\nWith Civ, the other strategy game that\npretty much has been burnt onto the\nback of the retina is the Simcity series.\nThe original Simcity was a game( hat\nalmost anyone could play, though few really mastered. The sequel Simcity 2000\nwas a step forward both in graphics and involvement, but was much easier to\nmaster. Soon excitement was only found\nin playing god and raining disasters\ndown on New Coventry.\nSimcity 3000 has extra complexity\nand improved graphics. We can hope that the dificult y level is corrected.\n\n"

    "content": "15 February 1999\nRag steps back from\nthe brink\nW ell, it's been a while, but it\nhad to happen eventually. Rag have finally got their act\ntogether, recovering from the in famous Willis era and the subsequent wilderness years. It would seem that\nthis year's events have proved to be very successful, and you can't argue with \u00a35000 for charity, mate. Of course, this figure may com pare un favourably with the medics' efforts, but no normal human beings will probably ever be able to match their slavish dedication and detachment from reality, to wit the Mli nci dent. All told, congratulations to both Rag camps, with four cheers for Sarah\nCoburn for finally giving ICU Rag its\ncredibility back. It makes a change to start on a happy note, particularly after\nlast week's uncompromising piece on incompetent staff, for which I make no apologies. And before you ask, the stitches I have are not due to a negative response from one of our Sherfield brethren...\nRebirth of the GLC?\nWhile I may have scribbled reams about tu rope, I haven't said anything about an imp or tant issue facing us a little closer to\nhome, namely the Greater London Authority, fearful that some of you may think that I don't hold an opinion on it, here goes my two' penne th. Now seems a goodtime to comment on it, because the Let Ken Stand campaign is getting into full swing. Not the mayoral election. Not the candidates election. No, the current battle is to get dear old Ken on to Labour's short-list.\nWhy the big fuss, I hear you cry?\nOlder readers should remember, of course, that Imperial's first years would have been about three years old when the Greater London Council was in its\nself destruction mode, so it bears repeating that\nKen Living stone as leader\nof the GLC was viewed, in\nsome quarters,\nas slightly wanting in his\nstewardship of the council. From where I stood, the man was off his\nrocker, more left wing than Stalin, and hell-bent on open battle with Lady\nThatcher. I still remember the halcyon daywhen she put the GLC and its\ninsidious sidekick, ILLA, out of their\nmisery. Unfortunately, this was not before millions had been wasted on a huge range of projects that ranged from the lunatic lo downright dis-graceful. The Thames Barrier, for exam ple, came in at about19 times the original budget; even Imperial can'th old a candle to that sort of incompetence. To list even a hundredth of the crackpot schemes that the GLC funded under Livingstone's leadership\nwould fill a year's Felixes.\nIt is also forgotten by many that\nKen secured the leadership after a Left-wing\ncoup, deposing the newly elected moderate council leader.\nAdmittedly, at a time when the influence of Red Ted Knight was still very strong, this\nwas not an uncommon event, London having more Marxists insurrections than Central America. Those who think of Ken as a witty, newt-loving\nblok e should bear this in mind. Simon Baker\nVoice of Reason\nTo stand or not to stand\nPi\n\"...from where I stood,\nthe man was off his\nrocker - more left wing\nthan Stalin, and hell-bent\non open battle with Lady\nThatcher...\"\nrob lem is, for reasons that are\ninexplicable. Ken is very popular with the electorate-. This greatly\ntroubles Mr Blair. The fact that anyone other than Blair is\nseen as popular is\nobviously a source of anguish for Our Glorious Leader, but there is an added complication in this\ncase- Ken is a Social ist. This, paradoxically,\nis why Ken plays well to the gallery, insofar\nas he is not a typical\nbrainless, humour less Blair drone, with which the Government benches are stuffed to bursting Therefore, he must be stopped at all costs. He must not be allowed to\nstand, let alone become Mayor. Of course, this is\nrubbish. If the Labour Party rank and file sup port Ken, he must be allowed to stand, and ultimately face the judgement of the pe o ple. Blair's opposition is\ncurious from a number of angles. It\nreinforces his image as a control freak,\nwho is permanently worried about dis-agreement and conflicting view/\npoints, however trivial.\nConsulting my Ladybird book of Clinical Psychology, I think that' s called paranoia. Also, if\nLabour have done the job properly( well, it's possible at a squeeze, I suppose), the GLA will have so little\npower that\nthe mayor, whosoever that should be, will ne ver be in apos i tion to rock the boat. If they have n't been that careful in the small print, God help us. Chances arc they have,\nto a greater or lesser extent, so let him stand. I must admit that this silly spectacle is great for the Conservatives, because at this rate it will be a one horse race, with Labour failing to decided upon a candidate in time for\nthe voting. Here' s hoping. A sea of red tape\nThe bigger question has sadly already been decided: do we need this new authority? The answer is no, but unfortunately we were stitched up in the referendum. Despite much campaigning, the issues\nof Mayor and Assembly were not split,\nmeaning all or nothing. The appointment of a mayor to oversee matters\nsuch as transport in London is pro b ably for Ihe good\"... do we need\nthis new authority?\nThe answer is no, but\nunfortunately we\nwere stitched up in\nthe referendum...\"\nThe only potential\ndownside from scrapping the GLC, outweighed a mill ion fold by the positives, was the elimination of a figurehead office for London. The personnel was decidedly dod gy, but the role was there. A mayor who was empowered lo co-ordinate pan-met-ro polit an issues would be beneficial, simple to implement and cheap. But ohno, we can't stop there.\nLet's whack in another tier of bureaucracy, just to ensure' democracy'. Sadly, local democracy is usually a sure-fire way of wasting money on the\npet projects of self-interested councillors who like the sound of their own voice slightly more than is healthy.\nConsequently, some of the benefits of\ncross-borough co-operation will be sacrificed on the altar of local account ability. If we really want some kind of\nmayoral accountability, beyond that\nto the electorate, delegates from the London boroughs, presumably their\ncouncil leaders, could form such an\nassembly. As it is, we have all the cost\nof running and housing the elected representatives. It is far too early to say\nif we are looking at a GLC Mk II, but\nwhatever the outcome, it is not the best solution for London. Yet again a policy for changing the way in which we are governed has emerged from New Labour half-baked and giving the\ndistinct impression that it has been drafted on a Chianti-stained napkin in\nIslington.\nSi\nA blatant plug\nome thing that I 've been meaning to plug for some lime is the IC\n' Summer Ball at Alexandra Palace.\nI managed to b laga ticket last year-1\nsay b lag, because I left it late and had\nto engage in all sorts of horse trading-and it was absolutely brilliant. You always think that these grand ideas fall\nshort in the delivery, but this was one of the rare times when Imperial delivered what was promised. This year will\nbe much bigger, and I have no doubt that tickets will go like hotcakes. Get\nyour cheque books out and prepare for what will be a cork er. Not 'arf.\n\n"

Luckily Iam unable to comment about President\nClinton' s impeachment( or lack of it),\nas at the time of writing the Senate was still debating behind closed doors. At the end of the day, though, we all\nknow the likely outcome he'll get a telling off, a slap on the wrist at best\n(or worst, depending on your political\npersuasion). With the cameras and reporters removed from the chamber, however, it is interesting to speculate how each Senator will use his allotted\nspeech time. You can see it now;\" Mr Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen. Did you hear the one about the Irishman...?\" Perhaps they could whittle away the minutes reciting poems for\ntheir loved ones. Whatever they're up to, I'm sure they couldn't possibly be\ntalking about impeachment. That\nwould go against the etiquette of the American legal system it would begetting to the point.\nA flick through news closer to\nhome is more interesting.' Chelsea Lose at H arlington' can do nothing but\namuse me. If players who are paid millions are stupid enough to leave Rolex es lying about in changing rooms, they won't get any sympathy from me. that financial and health problems are connected comes as no surprise whatsoever the old maxim 'healthy in mind, healthy in body' has scientific backing and, funnily enough, was the topic of my final year project.\nDon't start mc... Beyond Understanding?\nIgor Alexander's' Magnus' is a far more interesting topic. I personally do not have a problem with AI -1 can accept that within my lifetime there will pro b ably be computers whose responses are comparable to humans. What is\nmore interesting is asking at what point do we call such machines conscious, and give them the rights associated with such a property? After all,\n' higher animals'( i.e. pets) have more legal rights than your Pentium based workstation. How much longer can such a distinction be maintained with out moral contradictions creeping in?\nOf course, what is really at stake is our definition of consciousness, and specifically human consciousness. What is it to be human? Not an easy\nquestion for a Monday morning, I realise.\nThe point is that this is a philosophical question, and not merely a scientific one. No amount of neuro logical investigation or cunning circuitry can answer it, although they might provide different perspectives on what the question actually means. It may well be that the act of recognising consciousness defines il - i.e. if\neveryone believes a machine or computer program to possess human-like\nconsciousness, then for all intents and purposes it does indeed possess it.\nThis implies that your own 'status' as\na human is defined by those around you, and not from within you. Which would suggest il is impossible to fully\nunderstand what you mean by your\nconsciousness, as you play no part in\ndefining it. Hmmm. One for those late\nnights around the camp fir c,I'd say.\nElections Elections Elections\nIt seems that an unbelievable num ber (ie double figures) of you have\ntaken notice of the Union's call to nomination papers. Your five pages of manifestoes pushed this week's Felix\nto 32 in total. Hustings will belong. Very long. Votes will take hours to\ncount, re-allocate, and count again. Sorry, I'm just visual ising the ten days ahead. Honestly, Iam delighted; more pages keeps my printers in\nemployment, longer hustings means more beer drinking, and I love staying\nup all night producing election specials\n(OK, so that last one's only half true).\nGood luck to each and every one of you. And to the rest of you ICU members; they' ve signed up, written 300\nwords, put up posters, laid their pride\nand reputation on the line - so V OIL FOR THEM! Felix on the Move Again\nYes, it's four in the morning, and I'm complaining again. Those of you who arc nearer finals than fresher s' week will remember that last year le lix( and the now closed Print Unit) occupied an odd shaped, but ultimately spacious office where the dBs bar now resides. When the Beit redevelopment is complete, Felix and other Pub Board\nclubs will have lovely new offices in the basement, in time for the start of the2000/01 academic year. In the inter-ve ning two years, le lix was to have\n'suitable temporary accommodation', according to meetings my predecessor and I attended last summer. Ihe current office is, in my opinion, ideal - the\nfact that it is smaller than the previous one is outweighed by its shape, location and general ambience. Next year,\nhowever, we have nowhere to go. At\nthe moment it seems likely thai we will\nbe given the cabins near Physics - on the right as you head down from Prince Consort Road towards the Sherfield Building. They are not, in my opinion,' suitable accommodation', temporary or otherwise. I should note at this point that Iam no l( yet) blaming anyone. I would rather not have ahead to head argument with L sl ales.I have poked around college abi l,and can't really\nsee anywhere else thai is suitable. But\nnine thousand of you see more of the campus in one day than I could sec in\na week, even if I spent all the time looking. So if anyone does have any bright ideas, I would very much like to hear from you. If anyone agrees wil hme that those cabins are unsuitable;, I might be wanting to hear from you too...\nVale Valentines\nSo, how was Valentine's Day? I suspect\nthat I spent it filling in MSc application fot ms, doing my laundry and watching the Cartoon Network, while my Valen tine revised for forthcoming exams( good luck to everyone in Biology II by\nIhe way). Ilo pc Tully you spent it doing something more romantic. As lor the\nbest Valentine message in this issue...\nI don't know they're all soo good, I can't decide. Sarcasm is definitely a conversational tool...\nLn ough from me. To save you from\nmadness and to fill up the rest of this\npage, my good friend lain Mc n aug hl has written a brief history of Valentines.\nLnjoy your boy/ girlfriend, enjoy being single, whatever. Just make sure you vole.\nThe History Behind Valentine's Day\nValentine's day has along history. Us\norigins arc shady and uncertain but probably have their\nroots in Roman customs. On the four-teen th day of le bru arya festival\nknown as Luper cali a was celebrated. I his involved ritual whipping of young women with animal hide thongs to\nward off evil wolves and, so I hey believed, make them more fertile. The\nlatin for goat skin thong is feb rua this\nis where the month gets its name from. The Romans were a kinky lot,\nstill, it sounds more exciting than sending someone who doesn't know you exist an anonymous card in the hope that they might notice you as a result.\nWhat has whipping got to do with\nValentine's day if you' re not as a do masochist? Well, it's quite fun for those who haven't tried it. The date is\nassociated with fertility and picking a mate. It was a commonly held belief that birds (the flying kind) didn ol choose their suitor until Valentine's day each year.\nSaints Valentine( there were two of the m)arc both thought to have\nbeen early Christian priests. One was executed by the Roman emperor Claudius in 270 be for marrying young couples in contradiction of an impe rial order banning all marriage. Claudius thought that marriage distracted men from their duty to soldier for the empire;, so he banned it. Saint\nValentine married couples in secret,\nbut was found out, imprisoned and beheaded. The other Saint Valentine wasabi l of a Christian martyr. Imprisoned for\nhis beliefs, his parish children missed his kindness so much that they took him loving notes which they passed between the bars of his cell. The records don' l say anything about his\nsweetheart, only children. by lain McNaught\nThe reason why a fertility festival became a saint's day is the same reason that\nthe winter solstice became Christmas and the festival of the moon goddess Faster - Christian adoption of Pagan riles. I he Middle Ages saw the emergence o( Valentine's traditions as we know them today. I he first Valentine is generally attributed to that French\nsmoothie Charles Due d' Orleans. A prisoner of war in the tower after\nAgin co url in 1415, he wrote a rhymed versed' amour to his wife in trance on Saint Valentine's day. He followed this\nup with another sixty or so which can still be seen in the British museum. He clearly wanted her to keep his side of\nthe bed free, no l to mention Ihe fact\nthat he was probably getting a little\nfrustrated in the tower. In the seventeenth century il was common( or unmarried maidens lose ek their ideal man by pinning bay\nleaves lo their pillow on Valentine's night in the belief that they would dream of their future husband.Men would draw a woman's' names from a hat and wear il on their sleeve for\nthe next week hence the term we a ring one's heart on one's sleeve. Giving cards was common by the\n1800s.I'd say its much less fun than\nwhipping each other, but that's the way things have gone. Now you can cut out red crepe paper hearts for\nyour teacher at primary school or sends wish W lI Smith cards to those people you' ve always fancied but n ever had the g ut s to talk to. In the latter case I recommend beer as in my experience Dutch courage is far more success s ful than cryptic messages in poorly dis-guise d handwriting. Still, it's a nice;\nexcuse for you and your significant\nother lo make a romantic( and hope fully passionate) night of it. I know1 will.\n\n"
