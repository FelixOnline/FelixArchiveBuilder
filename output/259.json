    "content": "10 FELIX20 MARCH1968 HRY :\nSETBACKS\nAt a General Studies lecture last week Humphry Berkeley, chair\nman of the United Nations Association in Britain, explained the two\nsevere setbacks the campaign for human rights had received in this\ncountry in the past three weeks.\nLast December at a public meeting, members of all three political\nparties had given their support to the broad aims of the campaign\nwhich are to bring about an end to discrimination against women,\nand people of different races, both in Britain and her remaining\ncolonies. He accused the Lord Chancellor and Mr. Quintin Hogg of\nbeing \" shabby in the extreme \" for having disclosed these aims only\nthree months before supporting the 1968 Commonwealth Immigrants\nAct. Only the Liberal Party had emerged from that episode without\ntarnishing their honour.\nKenyan Asians\nThe position of the Asians\nin Kenya had been a problem\nsince 1963. Mr. Duncan Sandys,\nwho at that time was concerned\nabout the position of the 160,000\nAsians in Kenya, had said that\nas they did not satisfy Kenya's condition for citizenship they\nshould be given U.K. passports.\nThe idea behind this plan was\nthat while these Asians were\nachieving the conditions of citizenship which is that at least one\nparent is Kenya born, they would\nhave rights as British citizens.\nDuncan Sandys had not envisaged\nthat they would come and settle\nin Britain, but when this began to\nhappen hastily pointed out the\nloophole in the law. In Kenya,\nthe Asians had to work using\nwork permits, and as preference\nfor jobs was given to Africans (or\nrather Kenyan nationals) they\nfound work hard to find and some\ncame to this country\u2014many\npanicking after Duncan Sandys'\noutbursts. The British Government became unnecessarily disturbed by an influx of about 1,500\npeople a year and produced the\nCommonwealth Immigrants Act\nwhich had a two fold effect. The\nULU\nIN\nACTION\nOur university union is run by\nthe Presidents' Council and its\nvarious Sub-committees. PC's membership is the president of\neach constituent college of UL U and one other rep from each college\u2014the UL U agent. Between\nthem they must administer the\nunion and form the policy of the\nmembers. It is the latter that has\nbeen the centre of some interesting controversy this session. The\nmatter arose when the UL U rugby club played a fixture\nagainst an all white South African\nuniversity touring team, contrary\nto a directive from President's Council, who asserted that the\nfixture was contrary to Union\npolicy made in 1965\u2014that \" the\nuniversity does not take part in\nfixtures against South African\nteams \"\u2014and that the fixture was\nagainst the union's anti-a par heid policy. The issue seems now to\nhave become a thinly veiled rift\nbetween the sports clubs commit-tees, who maintain that clubs may\ncompete against whom they wish,\nand Presidents' Council, which\nnaturally wants to retain its\nsovereignty. The split will come\nto an interesting head at the next\nmeeting of the PC in May when\nthe motion that \" The Presidents'\nCouncil resolves that all Committees of the Union must be bound\nto implement policy decisions of\nthe Presidents' Council,\" will be\ndebated.\nPresident Elected\nThe election for President of\nULU for next session was held at\nthe Council meeting on Monday\nthe 11th March. It was a closely\nfought election in which Roger\nten years came in ten days and\nthat those left behind had a basic\nright removed as it became impossible for some of them to enter\nthis country for 40 or 50 years.\nBarbaric Hangings\nTurning to Rhodesia Humphrey Berkley described the recent\nhangings as barbaric. He said\nthat while the men were guilty of\nvile murders they had been kept\nunder sentence for three years\nwhich was a good basis for a re-pri eve. He added that as the right\nof appeal to the Privy Council had\nbeen refused and the Royal Prerogative of mercy had been\ndenied the hangings were illegal.\nMajority Rule?\nThe arguments for supporting\nthe Smith regime were question-able. The one that the Africans\nare not ready to govern looks ridiculous when countries like\nZambia and Malawi, which are\nat the same state of development\nas Southern Rhodesia have gained\nindependence. He felt that he\ncould only laugh at those who believed that anyway Africans\nwould achieve majority rule in\n15 years time. Under the 1961\nconstitution certain conditions\nmust be fulfilled before full voting\nrights can be achieved, primary\namongst these being secondary\neducation. The Smith regime was\npouring plenty of money into primary education, but had actually\nrefused a British government\ngrant for secondary education. He\nfeared that there seemed no basis\nfor negotiation, bloodshed might\nbe the only solution as the British\nGovernment with its history of\nsuccessful de colonisation must\nnever surrender to the 215,000\nwhites in Rhodesia.\nBingham, the current UL U coordinating officer, narrowly defeated fellow UC man, Fred\nEvans.\nSennet Sabbatical?\nAt last there is some hope of\nhaving a decent University news-paper, as some progress is being\nmade in instituting a sabbatical\nyear for the Editor of Sennet\u2014a move that I feel may well go a long way towards remedying the\npresent appalling position.\nFinally should any member of\nthe union be interested in the conduct of his affairs then he is entitled to observe meetings of the.\nPresidents' Council from the gallery of the Council room.\nRODERICK J. RED MAY NE(I. C.U.L. U. Agent)\nIRC TALKS ECONOMICS Economic Development is often talked about by economists in\nabstract. Some do not seem to realise that they are really talking\nabout relieving people of poverty. \"Poverty,\" Dr. Schumacher\nthought was the key word when tel king of development. He was\nwas starting the seminar on Technology and Economic Development\norganised by the Indian Society and the International Relations Club\non Thursday, 14th March.\nAfter having seen a harrowing film on the Bihar famine last week,\none which had to be stopped in the middle because of the extreme\nmisery shown in it, part of the audience were in no doubt about the\nneed for and meaning of economic development for the u ner developed part of the world. Dr. Schumacher started off by saying\nthat since the vast majority of people in the poor countries live in\nvillages that is the sector we should be endeavour ing to develop. He\nasserted that very soon we will have to stop the rush to cities since\nthey are reaching their saturation point: indeed, one only has to look\nat Calcutta in India or Lima in Peru to realise the gravity of the\nsituation. Having accepted that an incessant flow of people into\ncities will cause chaos: breakdown of services, mass unemployment\nand hunger, one is led to the inescapable conclusion that people will\nhave to remain on the land and this is only possible if their agricultural methods are improved. Dr. Schumacher believes that the way\nto do this is not ti give the peasants a sophisticated tractor or a combine-harvester but to try and find something between that and the\nsickle. This he calls the application of Intermediate Technology. His\nIntermediate Technology group has prepared a catalogue of relatively\nsimple tools available in England and the group tries to make this\ninformation avail a be to people in the poor countries. Groups similar\nto his have now been established in India, Peru, Columbia and the\nWest Indies. He gave various examples of how these groups had\nhelped in saving large amounts of money by providing information\non simple tools which can do the same task as very much more\nexpensive and sophisticated tools wholly inappropriate to the rural\neconomies. ,. . .. .\nt ions to it since it is unreasonable\nto expect Western firms to forego\ntheir royalties from developing\ncountries. To get round the problem Dr. Oldham suggested the\nformation of an International\nTechnology Agency which would\nhave two basic functions: (i) Technological and Economic, and\n(ii) Legal. It would advise firms\nin the poor countries on the kind\nof technological help they should\nhave and then give them legal\nadvice on the intricacies of patent\nlaws. He suggested that the rich\ncountries could give the licensing\nfees as aid : e.g. if a French firm\nwas to receive some royalties the\nFrench Government could give\nthem to it in French currency and\nas a result all concerned would be\nhappy : the poor country gets appropriate technology free, the\nfirm gets its royalties regularly\nand easily and the French\nGovernment gives aid in its own\ncurrency and helps a French firm\nsimultaneously. Despite this in-Free Technology\nDr. Oldham of the Sussex\nScience Policy Research Unit\nspoke on the paper his unit has\npresented at UNCTAD in New\nDelhi on \" Technology Transfer\nto Developing Countries: the\nRole of Licensing Agreements.\"\nUnder the present international\nnational patent and licensing\nlaws the poor countries pay enormous amounts to the rich countries with their scarce foreign exchange resources in buying their\ntechnical know-how. Approximately \u00a31 billion are paid annually in licensing agreements of\nwhich the United States gets approximately 57 per cent of all\npayments though it itself pays out\nonly 12 per cent. While it seems\nobvious that this is an undesirable\nsituation it is difficult to find so luge nio us suggestion some members\nof the audience were all for the\npoor countries pirating technology and forgetting about patent\nlaws !\nTurn-Key Projects\nMr. John White gave a spirited\ndefence of the viability and use of\nTurn-Key Projects which he defined as \" projects (usually large)\ncarried out by a contractor and\nhanded back to the purchaser\nwhen they are operational.\" He\nfirst decried all the \"One reason\"\ntheories of development like that\nof Dr. Schumacher and stressed\nthe multiplicity of problems that\nhave to be faced when talking of\ndevelopment. It was in this context that he spoke of the uses of\nlarge Turn-Key projects. The\nobjections raised against the sse are\nu suu ally with reference to past\nprojects which have failed. These\nhe said were usually because of\ndifficulties in the practical administration of these plants and he\ngave the examples of the new\nsteel plants in India. Thus the\nprinciple, or the potential use and\nviability of large turn-key projects\nis, in fact, u suu ally not ques-tio ned. Science Policy\nMr. Nigel Calder, the well\nknown science journalist and\nformer editor of the \" New Scientist,\" spoke on the need for science policy in developing countries to decide effective resource\nallocation. He stressed the need\nfor long term general planning\nand questioned the efforts of the\npoor countries in merely aping\nthe rich western countries. He\nseemed to be of the view that the\npoor countries should try to develop their own technologies appropriate to their societies. This\nwas not to say that they should\ngo through the same industrial is ing process that Europe went\nthrough but their methods should\nbe entirely new.\nThe meeting was a very instructive and fruitful one and\nsome novel ideas were heard.\nThere seems the obvious need for\npeople to devote more time on\nthese problems and, as Mr.\nCalder said, some basic re-think-ing is essential and delve in Western Technology totally inappropriate to their own countries ?\nRAKESH MOHAN.\nIRC LOOKS\nAT CB W Javad (Adolphe) Hashteroudian, a third year Chemist, has\nformed a group within the International Relations Club to investigate the use of Chemical and\nBiological Warfare in Vietnam.\nThey are at present compiling the\ninformation and hope to publish\ntheir results in the summer term.\nWherever possible they hope to\nuse only information from Western sources and as much technical and scientific data from open\nliterature as possible. They are\nin fact having difficulty because\nthere is so little information in\nthe literature and so much of it\nconflicts. The report is to be as\nunemotional as possible.\nNon -lethal ?\nThey have evidence from NFL sources that chemical warfare is\nbeing used but they are disregarding this information and using only that gleaned from Western reporters. The Americans\nclaim that the only chemicals\nthey are using are anti-folia nts which they say do not harm\npeople. They also admit to using\nami-riot gases. These are however marked, \" Not to be used in\ncases where death is to be\navoided.\" One of the compounds\nthe Americans are using is caca-dili c acid. This is arsenic and\nthe minimum lethal dose is 182\nmg per kg body weight. Even so\nthe US claims this just passes\nthrough the body without any\nharmful effects.\nWhen asked why he and his\ncommittee were compiling this\nreport, Mr. Hashteroudian said\nthat as he thought this was a scientific college and many\npeople may in future be involved\nin this type of warfare, it was\nonly fair {hat they should know\nwhat it entails.\nMORE ULU\nLanguage Bank\nOne of the first constructive\nthings UL U has done in living\nmemory is to instigate a language\nbank scheme. Initially envisaged\nas a totally independent project,\nit is now proposed that we should\noperate in conjunction with the\nCamden Committee for Community Relations who already have a small similar scheme. The idea\nis to provide people who are willing to act as translators for\nrecent immigrants, foreigners involved in the law courts or just\nanyone who needs an interpreter.\nThe area in which ULU, and\nmore particularly IC, can help is\nto act as a source of recruitment.\nHowever the entire success of tins\nworthwhile project lies in finding\nsufficient volunteers to offer to\nput their name into the language\npool. So if any of you are willing\nto help and are proficient in any\nlanguage other than English\nwould you contact Rory Redmayne in 96 New Beit (or via the\nCiv. Eng. or Union racks) as soon\nas possible so that London University may start to play an active\npart right away.\nHG LOSES\nSG Sinclair Goodlad, President of\nthe HG Wells Society since its\nformation in 1963, is to retire\n(from being President) at the end\nof this session. The job is to be\ntaken over by Lord Jackson of\nBurnley, Pro-R.ector of the College.\nMr. Goodlad is also giving up\nthe Sub-Wardenship of Tizard\nHall this Easter as he is getting\nmarried.\nINSTANT\nPUBLICITY\nDue to the present gro tty state\nof publicity within the Union, the\nS. C.C. has in its wisdom decided\nto hold a teach-in on Publicity at\nthe beginning of next term.\nSubjects covered will include\nhandling of Gestefax. Dyelines\nalso poster design. Open to all\nthe College, but especially for\nfuture Publicity Officers. Any\nenquiries to Robin Dibblee,\nTizard Hall.\nCARNIVAL\nRAFFLE\nEveryone is reminded to sell\n(and buy) raffle tickets for Carnival. The main prize of a Murphy\ncolour television set will be\nawarded to the winner of a separate competition between the\nfifty people selected by the\ndraw, for which the first prize is\na Pentax Sia camera, second\nprize a Grundig TK 145 tape recorder and third prize a Russell\nHobbs electric coffee percolator.\nThere will also be a prize for the\nperson who sells most tickets.\nThere will be a great chance\nover Easter to sell tickets. Anyone who thinks he may be able to\nsell more tickets than have been\nallocated to him, or has sold out\ncan obtain more from his year\nrep or for PGs from Bernie New,\nMaths 2B or 642 Tizard Hall.\n\n"

Three men come in, representing the establishment.\nAccording to them he is out of his\nmind because it is obvious that\nthere are men down there playing\ncards with boxing gloves on. On\nthe surface they are talking nonsense but there is a lot of truth\nbehind it. The highly stylised\ndialogue between the men was\nvery fast and repetitive and was\ndone very well. They poke fun\nat all sections of society, the\nchurch, politicians, scientists and\n\" the man in the street.\" The\ntwo old women, gossiping about\ntheir husbands in the background\nwere very amusing.

    "content": "20 MARCH1968 FELIX11 MESSING ABOUT IN BOATS WrW\nIn, out, in, oat, in . . . tn ln la a can be aul te tiring.\nThe ICBC, although little publicised, compared with many IC\nclubs, can certainly claim to be one of the most successful. A record\nof several victories at Henley against college and club crews, many\nUniversity of London wins and the fact that we have never lost posses\nsion of the University Trial Head Trophy in the seven years of its\nexistence confirms this.\nPerhaps a brief summary of the state of rowing at the present\ntime would be in order. Competition is broadly divided into races of\nnovice, junior, junior-senior and senior status and oarsmen can win\na number of events at each level. Clubs attempt to maintain crews\nof each status since the transition from novice to senior may only take\na few years.\nThere are two main ways of running a race. One is the \" head\nrace \" type in which teams are timed over a certain distance and the\nfastest time wins. The \" knock-out\" races of an open regatta are\nwhere two or more teams race side by side on a knock-out basis.\nThe standard of crews varies from clubs producing crews of\ninternational standing, for example Tideway Scullers, to the crews\nfrom schools, colleges and clubs which make up the bulk of the rowing in the country. On the whole, club rowing is of a higher standard\nthan that of school or college although there are exceptions, of which\nIC is certainly one, up to the standards of most clubs.\nNovice\nTraining. ..\nTo maintain the standards from\nyear to year, a club has to look to\nits novices for providing material\nfor the senior teams of later years.\nMany oarsmen come to us with\nexperience gained at their schools,\nmany novices start with no knowledge of rowing but this does not\nmatter. Fourteen members of\nthe three experienced crews at IC\nhave been trained only since they\narrived here. An IC ex-novice,\nnow in his third year, rows for\nthe UL U first eight. #\nTraining begins soon after\nFreshers' Day with the twenty-odd novices being taken on the\n\" tank\" where they are shown\nthe rowing technique by the\ncoach, the \" tank,\" a rowing\nsimulator, is arranged so that\neight oars-men can sit and row in\na fixed frame, with water circulating past at the same rate as if\nthey were on the river. They\nsoon find out how to avoid\n\" catching crabs \" and flailing air.\nThey are then put in crews and\nrow for one mile or so along the\nriver. The distance is slowly increased to 3, 4, 5 miles until, by\nthe second term, ten to eleven\nmiles has been reached and the\nboat is then moving quite fast.\nNovice racing starts in the summer and the eventual victory in a novice race at an open regatta\npromotes you from novice tc\njunior status, a step accompanied\nb va ducking in the river.\nSadly, novices quite often give\nup and we have this year reached\nan all-time low of twelve who\nhave remained faithful since signing up on Freshers' Day. However, it is never too late to join\nand novices who come late are\nalways found a team place.\n. . . . and\nSenior Training\nFor seniors, training begins immediately at the beginning of the\nyear. Much important work is\ndone in the gym (although less\nhere than at other clubs, unfortunately). Here, strength training is\ninflicted on all experienced oarsmen and some novices. It involves lifting very heavy weights\na few times (3 in our method)\nand the size of the weight is increased until the lift is just\nachieved Sometimes, fitness-circuits are employed but usually\noverall fitness comes with quite\na heavy programme of rowing\npractice on a Mortlake to Putney\ncourse (4\u00a3 miles). Sometimes the\ncrews are raced against each\nother on a handicap basis for the\nbenefit of slower, crews.\n. brings\nsuccess\nThere is no substitute for this\n(raining as is shown by the success\nof all our teams in this year's Winter Eights. After beating\nQMC in the first round, our\nfirst eight met UC, who had a blue and a purple and several\nUL U trialist s in their crew. After\nrowing dead level for a while, IC\neventually pulled away to win by\n2 lengths. These were our main\nopponents and we eventually won\nthe final.\nOur juniors and novices were also\nsuccessful in winning all their\nraces, the novices winning their\nfinal by almost 1 minute!\nOther victories include winning\nthe Southern Universities Championships and the win of our first\neight in the UL U Head of the\nRiver race.\nSmall Boats\nSmall boats are extremely good\nfor showing Hp faults in techniques since, if things go wrong\nin a sculling boat, there is no-one\nto. Blame but yourself! As you\nimprove, you get a feel of how\nwhat you do affects the boat and\nthis eventually leads to a greatly\nimproved technique in the eights.\nY. H.A. Round the Horn\nNot quite\u2014but it was certainly\na weekend to remember! Two\nminibus loads of men and women\nfrom IC and Bedford stayed in a Norfolk barn over the weekend\nand managed ?o fit in some excellent sailing, between memorable stomach-turning meals provided by their tame chef.\nWeather on the first day was\nsunny with a moderate breeze,\nthe second day turned to gusty\nwinds sufficient to get some excitement out of the 22ft. half-decker s. Most boats made (as\nlast year) an epic voyage across\nthe gusty two square miles io\u00a3\nwater known as Hickling Broad,\nbut on its return one boat managed to overturn in the strong following wind whilst performing a tricky mane ou vre( called \" hitting\na mooring post\"). The occupants\nfound that the water was wet and\ncold; but they're all panting in\nanticipation of the whole week's sailing which will take place over\nEaster.\nIf you're interested in joining\nthe Easter party, contact any\nY. H.A. Group member. Beginners will find that Mike Lovett's lucid \"Notes on Sailing\" will\nquickly brush away the. o bsc uri ties!\nF.B. KEYHOLE Y. H.A. Group General Publicity.\nWe experimented in previous\nyears with this idea as a method\nof improvement but it took so\nlong to teach people how to scull\nthat little hard work was put in\nand fitness suffered. Furthermore,\ncrew-members forgot how to row\nin an eight and the rowing suf-fe red. Still, the experience gained\nin sculling, pair and four-man\nracing put us in good stead for we\ngained several wins in summer\nsculling events.\nBurn- up\nAn interesting side line to\ntraining is the all-comers burn-up\nfrom Mortlake to Putney. Everything that could vaguely be said\nto be floating was paddled up to\nMortlake by ICBC members and\nany other interested parties.\nThen, starting with the slowest,\nthey all headed back to Putney.\nCome Hammersmith, they all got\ntogether and havoc was wrought\non the placid waters of the\nThames, the confusion continuing\nuntil the assembled hordes arrived\nat Putney.\nProspects\nThis summer our crews stand\na good chance of several wins.\nMay I especially mention our 3rd eight here.

    "content": "2 0 MARCH1968 FELIX9 THE SUNDAY\nMORNING SCENE\nIf one starts with the bold assumption that you don't spend\nSunday morning in bed (like any sane being) and the less bold assumption that you are not engaged in worship at the local shrine,\nwhat is there to do to break the monotony of Sunday morning?\nIf you refer to standard works on the \" happenings \" in London you\nwill find that the only activity which seems promising is the Sunday\nmorning market at \" Petticoat Lane.\"\nWell, one Sunday morning recently a further deterioration in the\nstandard of the \"Sunday Times\" Colour Supplement drove me to\nventure out to see what this place really was. The tube to Liverpool\nStreet is the best way to get there and Petticoat Lane, a fictitious\nname for the Market which is held in Middlesex Street, is only a few\nhundred yards a wav. The area surrounding the market is hardly inspiring but it is\nthe sort of area you expect to find\nin East London. So what do you\nsee as you enter the street where\nLondon's equivalent of the famous markets of the World is\nheld\u2014a seething mass of\nhumanity thronging down the\nmiddle of the road with endless\nrows of stalls either side of the\nroad. This confirms the conclusion that this is the main activity\nin London at this time on Sunday. Another conclusion you soon\narrive at is that most people,\namong whom is a large proportion\nof Americans and European tour-is ts, come just to look. I suppose the most popular attraction\nis the china and crockery salesmen with their non-stop, machine-gun patter and their crowd drawing act of throwing complete sets\nof china into the air and catching\nthem again almost invariably\nwithout mishap. I can count\nmyself among a privileged minority who actually saw several\npieces of \" unbeatable quality and\nworth ten times the price \" china\nshatter on the ground and a contented glow pass round the on-look ers. China\nJugglers\nBesides china what else is sold\nin the market? Well a large proportion of the market is devoted\nto clothes. They seem to be quite\ncheap and the quality is predict-able. This is not the place to buy\neveryday clothes but is just the\nplace to kit out with something\nsuitably \" extrovert \" for Morphy\nDay or Carnivals. If you are particularly addicted to useless objects in subtle shades of bright\npink or green plastic purporting\nto be \" Empire made\" this is\njust the place to come. It is conceivable that there are some bargains to be had but these, I suspect are few and this is basically\na place just to look. Like all\nsuch places Petticoat Lane is full\nof \" characters \"\u2014like the one\nfaithfully sticking to his duty of\ninforming the world that it's\" End is nigh \" and colouring the\nbelief with the occasional discordant hymn, the blok e who\ntries to persuade you that you\nreally can't do without a\" Universal vegetable sheer\" (which\nyou can buy in Woolworth's for\nIs. 6d. anyway!), and of course\nI know everybody wants their\nphoto taken with a neurotic\nmonkey, well this is just another\nfacility of Petticoat Lane.\nI think, if your willpower is\nstrong enough to get up on Sunday morning, then it is well worth\na visit but one tip, don't take any\nmoney with you then you won't be tempted to spend it and also\nyou can't tempt anyone to lift it,\na common hazard of gatherings in\nLondon.\nTONY LAKE. SIGHT AND SOUND\n\u2014 Touch Typing the T^ sy Way H.G. Wells predicted it, Aldous Huxley described it, SIGHT\nAND SOUND did if. Man has at last been turned into a machine\nthat will do what it is told to do (for part of the time anyway). How\nis it that a small group of people are dominating the minds of thousands of people up and down the country ?\nThe first stage is to trap the victim. Most people admit that the\nbest bait is food or to be more precise \" bread.\" How do we cet\nbread? By earning it. How do you do that? Well, SIGHT AND\nSOUND will tell you that quite a good way is by touch-typing. They\nseduce you into believing what a useful asset typing is and how much\nit will increase your chances of getting any job. then once they have\ngot you the brainwashing begins.\nTowards the end of last term,\nseven members of FELIX, assorted young ladies and a man\nwhom the supervisors soon began\nto describe as a\" hard case\"\nfiled into a room containing little\nmore than a set of desks with\ntypewriters on them and the fabulous SIGHT AND SOUND learning devices. These were a decrepit\ngramophone\u2014in a smooth cabinet\u2014and a chart displaying the\ntypewriter keyboard in a kaleidoscope of colours. We were told\nto put our fingers on the eight\nyellow keys of the typewriter in\nfront of us (these curious machines had plain keys so it was\nimpossible to cheat).\nNervous\nSpasms\nThe introduction started with\na metallic voice coming from the\ngramophone and lights flashing\non the board in front of us. The\nvoice said, \"Q now, A now, Znow.\" Each time it said a letter\nthat letter was lit up on the board,\nand each time it said \"now\" everyone in the room had a nervous\nspasm and in one violent convulsion pressed the appropriate key\nwith the nearest finger. For six\nsessions each lasting an hour we\nwere subjected to this treatment\nand by then we could type at\nabout 8 or 10 word* per minute\nwithout looking at the lights.\nThe next stage was more sinister\u2014no lights just headphones\nconnected to one of six or eight\nThe Audio-only room\nprogrammes. Lesson one of this\nstage was supposed to check that\nwe could type at 8 to 10 words\nper minute, or to be more accurate about 40 twitches a minute.\nIn Lesson two the magic voice\ngave up saying \" now \" and was\nreplaced by a metronome. During\nthis stage our twitch i bil it y was increased to about 70 to 75 twitches\na minute. The more resistant\nvictims had to go through this\nlesson three or four times before\nthe brain washing was complete.\nFurther lessons produced the magical rate of 100 twitches, or 20\nwords per minute, which is the\nguaranteed speed after 12 lessons.\nConcentration\nDespite this rather Orwellian\ndescription the typing course is\nwell worth the effort. The methods may appear impersonal but\nthe girl supervisors do their best\nto create a relaxed and more personal approach. It can only fail\nif one approaches it feeling tense,\nor if one's concentration wanders.\nMany people find it difficult to\nfocus their attention on one object\nfor an hour, and when this object\nis typing many people find it im-possible.\nFor anyone interested in le i ing to type the sight and s; id\ncourse can be thoroughly re com mended. The cost is 1\\ gn s to stu-dents. Members of the FELIX\nstaff will be happy to answer any\nfurther queries about it.\nJOHN SOMME\nARAB SOC MAKES FRIENDS\nA week last Tuesday evening\nthe Arab Society had as its guest\nspeaker Mr. Colin Jackson, a Labour MP and member of the\nexecutive of the council for the\nAdvancement of Arab-British\nUnderstanding.\nHe started by explaining the\norigin and aims of CAABU,\nwhich had been started mainly\nby MPs, writers, professors and\nstudents during the Arab-Israeli\nwar last June as a reaction to the\nIsraeli propaganda which was\nalmost all that was being disseminated in Britain. CA ABU now has about 1,000 members\nand recently got 1,200 members\nof the general public to a meeting on the problem of Arab ref u gees. The purpose of CA ABU is\nP HOT SOC EXHIBITS\nTo-day sees the last day of the\nPhotographic Society exhibition\nin Mech.

Fagg, A.P.R. S., who\ncommented that the selection of\nprints was varied and pleasing\nbut the standard of entries in the\nTechnical and Record section\nwas, he thought, rather low for a college such as this. It is interesting to note that two of the\nthree prize winner!' in the Photojournalism section have appeared\nas FELIX new j;ol o graphs this\nyear.\nto promote Arab-British friendship by political as well as cultural means. He mentioned that\nBritish soldiers would be out of\nthe Arab world in four years and\nsaid that a military presence did\nnot help understanding anyway.\nHe wanted to see more cultural\nexchange between Arab countries\nand Britain. \" I'm fed up with\nseeing the Bolshoi Ballet.\"\nNo antisemitism On the question of Israel he\nsaid that it was an affront to the\nArab peoples to have a theocratic\nstate imposed in the middle of a completely different part of the\nworld. He likened the situation\nto Mexicans \" going home \" to\nTexas and forcing Americans out\nwith the aid of China. He completely denied that there was anything anti-semitic in the opposition to Israel, and said there were\nROI NES scores again\nStuart \" Roines\" Senior was\non Thursday elected unopposed\nas Guilds Publicity Officer in\nsuccession to John Collis who\nresigned.

He likened the blue crosses\nput up on shops held by Arabs\nwho refused to open them to the\nyellow ones put on Jewish shops\nby the Germans in the last war.\nThe only peaceful way he could\nsee for the settlement of the Israeli problem, which he described\nas optimistic was : recognition of\nIsraeli, ships of all nations entitled to pass through the Suez\nCanal, withdrawal of Israel: to\nher position in June 1967 (in clu d ing giving up Jerusalem) and the\nsettlement of refugees.\nThis plan was severely criticised by many of the audience\nduring questions, by people who\nwanted Israel destroyed, but Mr.\nJackson said that he thought in\ntime Israel would become an\nArab Jewish state since there was\na net immigration into Israel and\nthe Arab Jews had a higher\nbirthrate. Other questioners\nwanted him to condemn the Arab\nmonarchies and sheikdoms, but\nhe did not want to factional is e the CAABU.\nI found some of Mr. Jackson's argument somewhat naive but on\nthe whole the meeting provided\nsome points worth considering\nagainst the usual background of\npro-Israel information dispensed\nin this country.\nDAVID COOPER.\nSilwood\ncomes of age\nThis year is the 21st anniversary of the College taking over\nthe Silwood Park Field station.\nTo mark the event a special ball\nis being arranged on June 7 th.\nES Peri mem Well's Soc's Ghost Group are now in the process of sorting and\nanalysing the returned forms of their first ESP experiment. The\nparticipants had to try to reproduce drawings made by a transmitting\nagent. All together five experiments have been planned, each involving 100 people.\nAbout half of the first batch of forms have been returned and 90\nper cent of people remembered to do their drawing every day nr' standard of drawing has been high (who says that scientists have no\nartistic ability?) Apparently the best drawings came from the Botany\nDepartment. A lot of the drawings had a nautical flavour. There\nhave been a lot of ships and lighthouses. Clocks have also featured\nstrongly, but this may have been due to the introduction of BST in\nthe middle of the experiment. Other favourites have been tables,\nchairs, geometrical shapes and daffodils. (Spring is on. the way,\nfolks!)\nAt the moment the original drawings are being kept secret so\nthat the judges cannot tell when they were done or who the v were\ndone by. The drawings are being judged several times by different\njudges for similarity of shape and similarity of subject. A statistical\nanalysis of results will be made by computer.\nThe name and location of the transmitting agent is being kept\nstrictly secret; in fact very few people know. The Group have been\nvery clever in not even telling their PRO man Jonathon Moont. All they will say is that the transmitting agent is located somewhere in\nLondon, aged between 30 and 40 and completely dissociated from I.C. At 8 a.m. in the morning he makes a drawing from a book. The\npage number of the book is obtained by playing dice. The drawing\nis then pinned up in his room. More than ten drawings were made in\ncase there was precondition or post-condition.\nMore people are still required for the second experiment and\nanyone interested should contact Jonathon Moont (Elec. Eng.). This\nexperiment will involve people from other universities as well as IC.\nUniversities in Australia and America have been contacted and it is\nhoped that they will join in the later experiments, although the cost\nand time involved might be too great.\nANNE WHEATLEY, Physics 3\nlb MR1\nThere was a young man in the Robbery,\nWho went from being flippant to snobbery.\nHe talked to Lord Bill\nFor good and for ill,\nBut not to the rest \u00a9fi the mob be ry.AN ON "

    "content": "FELIX20 MARCH1968 A series in which articles are\ninvited on subjects dear to the\nwriters' hearts.\nThe Frontiers\nof Human\nIgnorance\nSTEVE MALLINSON.\nThere is a dusty little office in\nthe grimy heart of one (or many)\nof our major cities. It is filled\nwith little men whose sole aim in\nlife is to persecute students. At\nirregular intervals they send requests to students\u2014they would\nbe grateful if one would fill in\nthe enclosed form and return it\nwith one's National Insurance\ncard. If like myself one has lost\nnot merely the present but the\nlast three cards they go into a frenzy of delight and choose\nanother form\u2014at random, it\nseems\u2014which must also be filled\nin (if the answer is \" no \" write\n\"no,\" a dash is not sufficient).\nOn one occasion I was sent a large sheet of paper which asked\nwhether I had taken a commission\nin the Merchant Navy.\nThis is a mental picture which\nI cannot shake off my mind. It\nis a natural reaction to human\nidiocy\u2014and what typifies this\nmore than the blind obedience to\n\" the System \" that form-filling\nrequires. I am amazed at the\nmoment by the number of firms\nwho wish to know not merely my\nfather's occupation but my \" O' level marks. The assumption\nthat the forms were concocted by\nan idiot with a sense of humour\n\u2014no one else could remember\nand compare the irrelevant information requested\u2014is difficult\nto avoid.\nThis distribution of signal less noise is not confined to forms.\nHave any of the letters to the press\non the recent student disturbances really said anything useful?\nWho are these people writing to\nGordon-Walker, and what form\ndo these letters take ? Aren't these also examples of word flowing about with little purpose and\nless effect ; aren't they just stereotyped reactions which the ever-yielding public reads and is expected to absorb with gratitude ?\nAnother major area of surplus\ncommunication is advertising.\nThe same message is repeated at\nvast cost in time and money and\nthe main purpose, it seems, is to\nkeep the competing products at\nthe same level in the public con-s cio us ness. Would people really\nfeel deprived if half the hoard-in gs in this country were torn\ndown, half the stream of circulars one receives were never sent?\nAll this vast amount of paper\u2014\nmostly ignored\u2014must surely *be\nmeasured in forests of wood and\nmillions of pounds\u2014-and isn't it a waste of time.\nProfessor Elliot in his recent\ninaugural lecture warned that the\npresent computer revolution was\na grave danger in that the machines are all too capable of\nswamping us in facts to such an\nextent that we will be in can abl c of reading let alone using all the\ntabulated output. He stressed\nthe need to reduce the output to\nsimply understood graphs and\nvisual display both of which\nmay be easily and rapidly understood and, if no longer needed,\ndiscarded.\nThere is, I think, an essential\ndistinction between information\nand facts. The number of the\nlatter which flow, to very little\npurpose, into filing cabinets, magnetic tapes, reports, tables of results and all too rarely into waste\nbins not only waste time and\nmoney but tend to swamp us to\nthe extent that we cannot stand\nback and absorb the information,\nif any, that they contain.\nWe must have new criteria of\nefficiency: are the waste-bins\nfull, the filing cabinets empty ?\nPeople must take precedence over\nsystems. Someone must be able\nto say \" Enough.\" We must try\nto question the questions (they're\nmore important than the answers)\nand then perhaps the dusty office\ncould close and the little men be\npensioned off.\nWe must stop pushing forward\nthe frontiers of human ignorance\nor we shall become a race knowing more and more facts about\nmore and more subjects and\nknowing less and less about\nthem.\nARE THEY MANIPULATING\nYOUR MIND ?\nAbout fifty prospective publicity officers, or just interested\npeople attended a talk on \" Advertising \u2014 Manipulation of the\nMind\" by Mr. Robert Brandon,\nthe head of an advertising\nagency, sent along by the Advertising Association. His talk dealt\nmainly with generalities about\nthe planning of advertising cam-pa ign s, rather than with the\nspecifics of producing advertise-ment s, and turned out to be\nrather dull.\nHe contrasted the old-fashioned statistical approach\u2014\nWhat are we selling ?\nTo whom are we selling ?\nWhen are we selling ?\nWhere are we selling ?\nwith the psychological approach\nof David Ogilvy\u2014\nTo whom are you talking ?\nWhat do you want to say ?\nWhat is in it for them ?\nWhat are we trying to sell ?\nExtremes\nHe used two pages from a recent Sunday paper colour supplement to illustrate extremes of\nthe two basic kinds of advert is ing. One was an advert for a cigar and was largely irrelevant\nto the product, using most of the\nspace talking about celebrating,\nand then suggested that when you\nwant to celebrate you should\nhave a cigar. The object behind\nthis was to implant the idea\nwhich would come to the front of\nthe mind at the right time. The\nother was an advert for a book\nclub, which had a reply paid\norder form with it. Visual presentation was not so important\nbut the page was packed with\nall the information necessary, as\nthe reader had to be persuaded\nto buy books on the spot and not\nhave the idea implanted.\nHistory He then gave a short history\nof advertising, saying that it was\nstarted in the 1880's by William\nHesketh (later Lord) Lever who\nhad the idea of packaging and\nbranding his own goods and then\ngetting other shops to sell them.\nIn 1887 Lever saw Millais's \"Bubbles\" in the Royal\nAcademy, bought it and started a tradition which survives to this\nday of advertising Pear's soap\nusing this picture. The printing\nmachine was also instrumental in\ngetting the advertising revolution\nunder way. About one-quarter\nof the people .employed in the\nprinting industry in the country\n(80-100,000 out of 340,000) are\nemployed in advertising. There\nare 18-20,000 people in the rest\nof the industry. Because of advertising the number of people\nselling goods to shops is drastically reduced and frees these\npeople for more creative act iv i ties.\nHe ended by giving some specific examples of advertising campaigns which he considered good\nand successful.\n\n"

    "content": "I20 MARCH1968 FELIX NO NEPOTISM\nIN BEIT\nDear Sir,\nIn Andy Jordan's column Mar.\n6th, he comments on the allocation of Warden's places in halls\nof residence. It seems that Mr.\nJordan is accusing me of using\nthese places to put members of the\nGliding Club into Beit Hall. He\nexplicitly says \" But it is bound to\ncause speculation when certain\nmembers of these clubs got into\nthese halls when they were not\nselected by the hall committees.\"\nThe previous sentence makes it\nclear that he is referring, inter\nalia, to the Gliding Club and Beit\nHall.\nSo far as Beit Hall is concerned,\nthis alle a ation is quite untrue.\nThe Warden of Beit Hall has\nfive places at his disposal. From\nthe records of the last five years\nit is apparent that they have\ngenerally been filled with \" deserving cases,\" on medical or\nother grounds. When these places\nhave not been required for this\npurpose, they have simply been\nfilled from the waiting list. Out\nof the 25 students involved over\nthis period, only one has been a member of the gliding club (two\nyears ago) and membership of the\nclub was not the primary reason\nfor admitting him. At present\nnone of the Warden's places are\noccupied by members of the\nGliding Club. Those members of\nthe club resident in Beit Hall\nmust therefore have been chosen\nby the Selection Sub-Committee\nor, in the case of fresher s, have\nbeen recommended by their de-partments. In this hall, selection\nof residents is genuinely in the\nhands of the student members of\nthe Selection Sub-Committee. I retain my power of veto, but I am\nglad to say that it has not been\nnecessary to exercise it for some\nyears.\nThe several members of the\nGliding Club in Beit Hall may\nwell have put this hall as their first\nchoice on the application form,\nbut it is clear that they are admitted on their own merits. This\nsuggests that the club contains\nsome rather worthy members,\nwho do not have to depend on the\nnepotism of the Warden, as Mr.\nJordan would have his readers\nbelieve. In this context, is it not\na Good Thing for the Warden to\nshare an interest with some of his\nstudent residents?\nNow that Mr. Jordan is aware\nof the facts, I expect him to retract his allegation and render\nan apology.\nYours faithfully,\nF.G. IRVING\nAndy Jordan writes\nIt is unpleasant to find that one\nhas been dishonest in effect if not\nin fact, especially in print.

However, your Late\nNews Editor described this Teachin in terms which were more blatantly prejudiced than any I have\nheard in previous debates on this\nsubject.\nYour editor reported the arguments of the South Vietnamese\nMinister clearly and in some de-tail, but of his opponent's speech\nhe said only the following, \" He\njuggled quotations without too\nmuch regard for who actually\nsaid them, and juggled figures to\nentertain us. This was no reasoned argument, but an effective\noutpouring of scorn and pre ju dice.\"\nI should prefer to judge for myself whether or not this interpretation is justified by reading a synopsis of the speech written as\nsympathetically and in as great\ndetail as the report of the Minister's was.\nAn in d is pensi ble duty of any\nnewspaper which claims to be\nmore than a partisan tract is to\ngive opposing views with equal im-partiality, and this Felix Late\nNews has failed to do.\nANDREW STEWART\nElec.

I was\nthere.\nI am not anxious to discuss the\nVietnam issue itself in the late\nnews columns, rather I wished to\nreport the phenomenon of a successful teach-in at I.C.I assure\nyou I can write in a much more\nprejudiced fashion when the occasion demands.\nNLF at\nPolsoc?\nDear Sir,\nI must make one correction to\nyour article on our Vietnam\nmeeting on March 5th. This is\nthat I.C. Political Societies Council is hoping to arrange for a spokesman from the South Vietnamese National Liberation\nFront, not the North Vietnamese\nas you said in your article.\nAs one of the questions at the\nmeeting revealed, the British\nGovernment used to have a permanent ban on the issue of visas\nto South Vietnamese N.L.F. spokesmen\u2014in fact, this was the\nstatement which we received\nfrom the Home Office last November in answer to our request\nfor a visa for this meeting. We\norganised a lobby of M.P.'s and\nas a result of their pressure on\nthe Home Office, we received a letter from the Home Secretary\nto the effect that \" there is no\npolicy of automatic refusal.\" It\ntranspired at a meeting which we\nhad with Home Office officials in\nFebruary that they were chiefly\nconcerned to see that an N.L.F. spokesman did not go from our\nmeeting to another .such as a disorderly rally in Trafalgar Square.\nAt the time of writing, we have\nreceived no reply to our requests\nto various N.L.F. delegations in\nEurope for a spokesman. When\nwe do, we will approach the\nHome Office for a visa, for a meeting probably for May.\nYours sincerely,\nMIKE BAILEY.\nSecretary, Pol. Soc.

In those days, the opposition party\nwas a radical party. And then one day, the devil became God and\nthrew the Tory God from his heaven. And God was righteous,\nmiddle-class and anti-student (if the middle-classes and Duncan Sandys\nwere). No longer was there a place for the protesters to protest. If\nyou hated the Americans in Vietnam, the racial is m of Rhodesia, the\nracial is m of Rhodesia, the attacks on the living standards of all but\nRobert Maxwell and Swiss bankers, you might as well have joined\nthe Conservatives as Labour.\nSo when Harold Wilson and Denis Healey went to Cambridge, the\nonly apparent form of protest left was used. No one listened to words\nnow ; an open mouth might foul the Socialist government. I said\nSocialist : there must have been many hues of Socialism from Hitler's national socialism to Karl Marx's. Before that time, when even your mummies and daddies listened\nto stories at other parents' knees, some declared they would fight for\nKing and Country, decried attacks on Abyssinia, rejected Munich.\nThey were students. They disagreed with their elders. It may be\nargued that history proved them right. Age does not always bring\nwisdom.\nThe second time around, people wrote to the Times : \" Our students will find that the long-suffering taxpayer will protest successfully\nthat these are not the sort of person who should have the privilege of\na university education.\" Patrick Gordon-Walker thought the effect\nof student demonstrations on the grants issue was \" very grave.\"\nNo one had heard him say that the in sobriety of Morphy Day would\naffect grants. Political undertones of the noise, raised through desperation at a political system which suddenly no longer accommodated\nall political opinions, gave the signal for a barrage of illogical it y against the students. k And in the quiet concrete corridors at the foot of Collcutt's tower, they endlessly discussed apathy and no one cared. They were\nscientists; they had chosen interests remote from human situations,\nand they did not care about other people's problems. Some cared\nbut the v did not rebel in Prince Albert's hallowed cloister. They\nand their mentors agreed in soft acquiescence. The outside realities\nrarely percolated through the glass and cement.\nThere was, after all, little to rebel about. When the students\nwanted a better dialogue with the powers that were, their representatives sat with the Deans' Committee. All were sweetly reasonable.\nBut some seemed to think that methods unnecessary in their own\nmonastery were therefore unnecessary outside. The methods used\noutside were denounced as the actions of a vocal minority, said to be\nunrepresentative of the students as a whole.\nBut could not this argument be extended to their own exe uti ve. Was it representative of students as a whole, this vocal minority?\nAnd were its members really the voice of the people when it seemed\nthat they could not maintain contact within themselves. The hapless\nsix arranged for two union meetings not only at the same time as one\nanother but on the day of two departments' open day. They were to\nhave organised a meeting of council members with year reps but\nunfortunately two-thirds of the year reps were not informed. They\ndeclined to call a council meeting, when so requested by council, on\nthe grounds that council had nothing to discuss: the next meeting\nlasted five hours. In the certain knowledge that no one cared, they\nfailed un constitutionally to post Union meeting agendas.\nNapoleon did not make Moscow. Art Garfunkel did not make\nthe Albert Hall. Barbarella Hempeldumpkin did not make the big\ntime. I did not make Barbarella Hampeldumpkin. This executive\nhas yet to make ICU tick.\nRGperftT\n\n"

The\npitch was uneven and iron hard\nwhich made controlling the ball\nvery difficult. This seemed to\nrob the game of skill and it became a contest of strength and\ndetermination.\nThe first twenty minutes were\nrather slow, tough tackling from\nboth defences cutting out the\npossibility of any dangerous\nattacks. But then a slip by the\nIC defence, mainly due to tricky\nconditions, left QMC's centre forward on his own with only the\ngoalkeeper to beat which he did\ncompetently. 1-0 to QMC but a minute later it was 1-1 ; almost\nstraight from the kick-off IC\ncentre-forward Tony Richards\ncompletely beat the QMC goalkeeper with a beautiful 25-yard\nvolley.

The IC\ndefence fought back, Wojtowicz\nthe goalkeeper making two good\nsaves. With about 10 minutes to\ngo, however, IC's luck ran out\nand QMC equalise d. This seemed\nto bring IC to their senses and\nthe final 10 minutes turned out\nto be a nerve-w racking fight to\nthe death. Both teams came\nclose to scoring on a number of\noccasions and with only 3 or 4\nminutes left IC got a decisive\nfree kick just outside the QMC\npenalty area. The ball was\nfloated across into the QMC\ngoal-mouth and headed over the\ngoalkeeper's head towards the\ngoal-line. Breathing stopped as\nabout six players ran to meet the\nslowly dropping ball whose destination was obviously hotly disputed but Denis Harlock was\nthere first to put it into QMC's net and the cup was I.C.'s.

Drawn in the four\nteam league they easily came top by beating Royal Holloway 1-0,\nKings 1-0, and Bedford College 3-0.\nHaving earned their place in the final, they had to wait to see\nwho would win the five team league. As it turned out UC were convincing winners making the final a replay of the preceeding Saturday's match.\nIC heartened by the vociferous\nsupport of the victorious IC football 2nds were on the attack for\nmost of the first half, and after a lot of pressure on the UC goal,\nthe left wing, Joyce Butcher,\npushed the ball into the corner of\nthe net. At half time the score\nwas 1-0, but shortly afterwards\nUC equalized after a defensive\nmix-up.\nIC was a little disheartened by\nthis but cheered up immensely\nwhen UC deflected a cross-ball\ninto their own net. The game was\nclinched when the left inner,\nMargaret Lumley, made a long\nsolo run beating all defenders and\nslammed the ball into the back of\nthe net. IC had beaten UC again\nand won the tournament.\nThis season has been the best\nthat ICWA has ever known. They\nhave won both the mixed and\nwomen's one day tournaments\nand also the UL knock-out cup.\nSuccess is due both to the skill of\nthe players and to the exceptional\nteam spirit.

VIETNAM MEETING\nA public meeting entitled \"Vietnam the social responsibility of science\" was held\nunder the auspices of the I.C. Peace Action Group on Monday. Only about 20 people\nbothered to attend and consequently in waiting for others to come, the meeting started\nvery late and not everyone had a chance to speak.\nDr. Steven Rose (of Biochemistry) spoke first and dwelt at length upon the affair of\nDow Chemicals (reported elsewhere in this issue) who make Napalm and defoliants for use\nin Vietnam.

What is science? Science has to do things around us. Its real value is to make the people who\nstudy it better. Therefore we should not associate ourselves with the science used in Vietnam as it was bound to wight heavily on our consciences and certainly make us bad.\nConsidering the attendance at the meeting, one wonders I.C. really cares about the\nuse of science in modern warfare.

    "content": "4 FELIX 20 MARCH1968 CEDITOR'Somme nt Another term ends, most of the year's activities have finished.\nThe Union will sink into examination euphoria with the only events\nto brea'!: into the monotony of revision (or catching up on a year's lectures) will be the elections of a few club committees to beat the\nMay 1st Hall application deadline, the few summer sports clubs, a couple of bleak issues of FELIX and if everything goes to plan the\nfirst residents will be moving into Linstead and the first student house\nand the Sports Centre will come into use. Of course a new executive\nand Council will be elected, in fact Barry Sullivan is already Presidentelect of Mines, but that doesn't seem as though it will worry many\npeople, particularly when the present exec won't even put the stu-dents' views, which they supposedly represent, or provide any leader-ship, by lobbying their M. Ps., and everybody will have gone home by\nthe time the President and Secretary are elected.\nSo what has happened this term? Whilst York and Leicester\nhave been demonstrating about refectory prices, Aston and Regent St.\nPoly have had trouble over representation on their Governing Bodies,\nManchester and Cambridge have demonstrated against members of\nthe government, and students from all over the country have taken\npart in action to oppose the grants cut. what has I.C. done? Corporately nothing whatsoever, unless you count the passing of two relatively\nminor constitutional changes for the first time. I do not have access\nto details of all student unions in Britain, but I would hazard a guess that I.C. is the only major one in the country which does\nnot have an official policy on the grants issue. Perhaps, as Andy\nJordan says in this issue, it is because we have not for a long time had\nto fight for our rights in this College, that people are finding it difficult\nto believe that now they must. Or since they are not too hard up at\nthe moment they think that they will be able to live on a slightly\nincreased amount in three years time (if not mummy and daddy will\ncough up anyway). What happens if mummy and daddy can't afford\nit, or decide it's time you supported yourself?\nThere are many good things about I.C. Union, in fact much can\nbe compared with the best in the country, the clubs are excellent in\nquality, quantity and variety. The social calendar is the best in\nLondon ,and many people put in a lot of work making them so.\nBeing, like Mr. Kinsella, (see the letters in the last issue) a past chairman of a club, I knew this long ago. So do Council, over half of\nthe student members have held the post of chairman on the equivalent\nposition in I.C. clubs, whilst most of the rest have been active in\nthem. The I.C. sports clubs have had a large number of successes this\nterm, as have many of the other clubs in one way or another, and they\ndeserve the congratulations of everyone in the College.\nHowever, if the Union does nothing as a body, then interest will\nwane not only in the Union itself but in its clubs, which after all are\nan integral part of the Union. Judging by the correspondence in the\nFB L1 X letters column and the declining attendance at Union meetings\nv ople are becoming rapidly more and more disillusioned with Union\npolitics. It should not be necessary to cancel General Studies because\nof a Union meeting and it cannot give Mr. McDowall, who arranges\n(and cancels) these lectures much comfort to know that his work has\nbeen in vain, especially when much of the failure is due to executive\nbungling, as it was on Thursday. When six people cannot arrange\nUnion meetings so as not to clash, what hope have 3,650 got?\nI had always thought that the constituent college presidents sat on\nthe executive to ensure co-ordination between our four Unions and\nt6 make sure that the interests of the three were not in opposition to\nthose of the one. Apparently I was wrong. By all means let us keep\nthe tripartite structure, it is a fine tradition, and as such should not be\ndiscarded quite so carelessly as some would, but when there is a clash of interests I hope that it will not again be EC' s which will\nsuffer.\nImperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel.

Dear Sir,\nMay I first commend you on\nyour attempts to bring the decrepit union to life and on your\ncoverage of the grants campaign.\nHaving done that, can I now dare\nto call you apathetic and parochial and express the hope that\nthis will be printed.\nFor us, students, our Union is\nimportant, our grants more so,\nbut do these topics deserve as\nmuch as half of the space in\n\" FELIX\" as they have been\ngetting in the past two issues ?\nShould not a student newspaper\nhave more comment and criticism on topics of a slightly wider\nnature ? While I cannot presume\nto tell you what your job is I do\nfeel that \" FELIX \" can be improved still more than it has been\nin the past.\nThe last issue could have had\na comment on the recent controversial, effectively racialist, im-mig ation bill; especially since\nthere is such a large number of\ncoloured students in the College.\nIt is seldom that one finds other\nuniversities mentioned in\nFELIX : surely the recent events\nat Leicester and Sussex Universities should have elicited a critical\nword from you. Earlier this session you reported a decrease in\nthe applications to IC and mentioned the swing away from\nscience, but you seem oblivious\nof the publication of the Dainton\nReport which could have a considerable bearing on the future\nscientific and technological community of this country. The\nSouth Kensington bye-election is\nsoon to be held : the nominations\nwere filed last week but even\nthough we live in this area\nFELIX has nothing to say on the\nsubject. With so much space\ndevoted to \" in \" union politics\nnot more than ten societies were\nmentioned in the last issue : is\none to conclude that the other\n70 odd are largely dormant ?\nThese were a few of the random\ntopics that spring to mind which\ncould have found space in\nFELIX. Surely your staff of\n20-plus can do better.\nI do not know what you think\nthe aim of a student newspaper\nis but may I voice what I feel\ncould contribute to making\nFELIX a more lively newspaper:\nit would have the following\nbroad categories of articles:\n(i) College activities: These\ncould include reports on important happenings during the fortnight\u2014cultural, social and sport;\ncomments, reports, etc. on the\ndoings of the Union; information,\non future events.\n(ii) External university events\nand happenings: Presumably you\nget newspapers from all universities in the country and some\nfrom abroad.\n(iii) Political comment on topical issues.\n(iv) Reviews of plays, films,\nballet, opera, etc. After all we do\nlive in London.\n(v) Book reviews.\n(vi) Original articles of a literary nature.\nI hope you do not take this to\nbe a belligerent letter for it is\nmerely a suggestion on how\nFELIX could be more lively\nand not so introspective. The vast\nmajority of students do not consider the Union or their status as\nstudents as the be-all and end-all\nof their lives.\nYours faithfully,\nRAKESH MOHAN.\nMIKE\nUNITED\nWE STAND\nMike\u2014our wandering mascot.\n(The right way up this week)\nSir.\nI should like to thank r^ li*\nfor their dramatic expose of the\nreasons for the repeated disappearance of Mike. It must now\nbe quite apparent to WHO that\nthe sky hooks shown in the last\nissue to be the sole support cf\nour mascot are quite inadequate;\nlet us hope that on recovery Mike\nwill in future be kept in its rightful place on it? plinth.\nYours faithfully,\nRODERICK J. RED MAY NE. Apology\nUnfortunately, due to lack of\nspace in tl is is su \u00ae, several letters\nhave not been published: These\nmay be seen on request.\nRecent editions of FELIX have\ncontained much copy concerning\nthe apathy and apparent disillusionment by many IC students\ntowards the parent Union and its\nofficers. From this and the poor\nattendance at Union meetings, it\ni:. reasonable to conclude that\nsomething is seriously wrong with\n.he organization and structure of\nstudent activities within the Collage as a whole. In a recent is-sue, your correspondent \" Apathetic Chemist\" beneath a veneer of frivolity, managed to\npoint out several important contributory factors which have\nhelped to bring abou i the present\nsituation.\nHowever, I feel that the\nstrength end impact of these fac-tors, such as the lack of aims and\nof policies, depends to a large extent on the persona'i ties and\n\" political\" climate prevailing\nwithin the Union at any one time,\nand cannot, therefore, be regarded as the correct a a gnosis to\npreclude any \" cure.\" Certainly,\nas a postgraduate student with\npast experience of stud ant life at\nUniversity College, London,\nwhich is comparable in size and\nstatus to IC. I suspect that the\nreasons for this apathy lie in the\nstructure of the College and are\nthreefold in number : \u2014\n1. The existence of the three\nconstituent college Unions serves\nonly to dilute and weak?;-: the participation of students in Union\naffairs. Much of the available\ntalent for organisation and leadership is creamed off by *he Colleges and the rank and file o: students have insufficient time,\nenergy or inclination to follow\nboth of the available be cues.\n2. In a un ivars iy sol leg e which is so pre dom in cnt ty concerned with science and 'cino-logy and lacks a broad range of\nacademic disciplines amongst stu-dents, the standard of debate and\ndiscussion is bound to reflect this.\nWhilst the individuals may be of\nthe highest standing and repute,\nthe spectrum of the College is\nnarrow and restrained and expert\nopinion whether from the staff\nor students is not available on\nmany matters, thereby reducing\nthe authority with which the College speaks.\n3. The division of the College\ncampus into segments, each separated from the other by main\nroads, is a deterrent to student\nmovement and whilst it would be\ndifficult to prove, it could well\npartially explain poor attendance\nat various functions. Certainly a united campus helps to give students a sense of identity and be-longing.\nWhat then can be done about\nthis? Presumably the negotiations\nwith the Architectural Association\nconcerning their admission to the\nCollege is the forerunner of increasing academic choice. Also it\nis conceivable that traffic management or upper pedestrian circulation could unite the College\ncampus at some time in the\nfuture. But both of these solutions require time, and the more\nimportant question is what can be\ndone now? In answer to this I would suggest that one thing can\nbe carried out immediately and\nmay be the most advantageous\nstep of all\u2014abolish the constituent college Unions and concentrate the student energies ;.n to the\none that counts, the main College\nUnion. Certainly, it is by IC\nUnion and not by C&G, RSM or\nRCS Unions that ICST is fudged\nby and listened tc in other quarters. W.A.i1. KEE, F.G. "

Outside\nthe US Embassy the police stood three deep and struggled to contain\nthe demonstration. When the police horses advanced on the crowd,\nIC students were almost trampled underfoot. They say, \" Police were\nsadistically kicking people who had been knocked over,\" presumably\nbecause they had ignored police orders. After the activities outside\nthe Embassy the crowd was supposed to go to that symbol of American imperialism, the Hilton Hotel, but for the most part the militants,\nwere either in police buses or in hospital.\nWESTMINSTER\nLOBBY FAILS\nLast Wednesday about twenty LC. students attended a\" mass \"\nlobby oJ M.P.S about students grants. It was a fine demonstration of\nstudi it t \"apathy\" as on iy about 500 students, teemed to consider it\nworth while to draw attention to their sorry financial state. Perhaps\nthey could not afford the fare to Westminster.\nStewards appointed by N.U.S. marshalled people into their constituencies telling them that when there were six people to see one\nM.P. they would be let in. Six I.C. students quickly formed themselves into a group to see Mr. John Smith, M.P. for City of London\nand Westminster in whose constituency I.C. lies. On entering the\nlobby they filled in a little green card requesting to see Mr. Smith and\nbegan waiting. For an hour and a half they waited only to hear that\nhe was not to be found. By this time more I.C. students h;.d gained\nentrance to the lobby and filled in their green cards. Unfortunately\nnone of the ten M.P.' sI.C. students requested to see could be found.\nOther student groups\nwere\nmore successful and about 20 or\n30 M.P.'s came out to see their\nconstituents. Most students\nseemed quite satisfied with the interviews they had, but this was\nhardly surprising as the majority\nof \" available \" M.P.'s seemed to\nbe members of the Opposition.\nNotable among \" absent \" M.P.'s was Patrick Gordon Walker, the\nEducation Minister, who had\nbeen seen entering the House\nduring the afternoon. The inability of the messengers to find\nhim can only be interpreted as a measure of his cowardice and not\nof the length of the corridors in\nthe Houses of Parliament. No\nleading government minister\nseemed available which was surprising as there was a division\nwhile the lobby was going on.\nOnce a gan diplomacy seems to\nhave triumphed over democracy.\nThe I.C. turnout can only be\ndescribed as disappointing. Three\nmembers of the External Affairs\nCommittee appeared and only one\nactually got into the lobby. No\nmembers of the Executive were\nthere and only two members of\nCouncil, who were there because\nthey are External Affairs Committee members too, deemed it\nnecessary to try to see their\nM.P.'s. Perhaps they represent\nthe Union in other ways but i seem to have ignored one of\nmost effective ways of making\nstudents' wishes known.\ney\nle\nhe\nDOWSTAYAWAY\nThe proposed recruitment visit\nto Chem Eng by Dow Chemicals,\nwho make napalm in the U.S., has been cancelled following\nrumours that IC Peace Action\nCommittee was organising a demonstration to coincide with\nthe visit which would have been\non Monday.\nLast week. Bob Mackman,\nPresident of RCS, heard of the\nplanned demonstration and notified President Phillips. He then\nwent to see the Rector, who decided that the publicity could be\ndetrimental to IC. At the Rector's request Professor Ubbelohde,\nhead of Chem. Eng. department,\ngot in touch with Dow who\nagreed to cancel the visit and arrange the interviews elsewhere.\nA petition to the Rector asking\nthat firms who \" misuse science\nin Vietnam \" should be prevented\nfrom recruiting in the College is\nbeing circulated by the Peace\nAction Group.\nNO FAME\nUNION MEETING\nDEPLETED BY GUILDS\nDespite the vast volume of\npublicity heralding Georgie\nFame's appearance at the May\nBall, Ents now announce that he\nwill not, after all, appear. There\nwas a clause in his contract allowing him to withdraw up to six\nweeks before his projected ap-pe ann ce. Recently he was\noffered a film contract and is taking advantage of this clause.\nEnts now are trying to engage the\nScaffold and Dave Mason, late of\nTraffic, to replace Fame, and\nwith any money over they may\ntry for Madeleine Ball.\nNEXT FELIX\nThe next issue of FELIX will\nbe a duplicated one on the first\nWednesday of term, 24th April.\nAll contributions, What's On,\nSmall Ads., etc., must be received\nby 7 p.m. on Monday, 22nd April.\nNEW DEAN\nThe new Dean of the Royal\nSchool of Mines will be Professor M.G. Fleming of the Mining\nDepartment. He was elected to\nsucceed Professor J. Sutton of\nGeology, and will assume office\nfor a period of three years starting next session.\nThursday's Union Meeting, as was generally expected, took place\nin its by now accustomed state of in quo racy and was eventually\nadjourned by President Phillips until the early part of next term.\nHowever, had it not been for the annual event of the Guilds Field\nCup, which was taking place at the same time, the numbers present\nmight just have been boosted from 250 to the 300 required for a quorum. One cannot accuse Guilds 'of directly sabotaging ICU\nmeetings, but this is the second time this year that a Guilds happening\nhas coincided with a Union Meeting (the previous time being a Guilds\ncarnival collection at the Varsity match). So with the quorum failing\nyet again, it now seems that Derek Boothman's mammoth constitutional amendment, the major item for discussion, will be lost for\neternity without even being debated.\nDespite the attendance, several'\nitems of mild interest occurred\nincluding the unopposed election\nof Rob Collinge, author of the\nCollinge Reports on Student Finance and Student Houses, to fill\nthe vacancy on Council caused by\nthe resignation of Malcolm\nDuckett several weeks ago.\nA letter had been received\nfrom the Rector outlining the\nstructure of the Appeals Board\nfor hall residents convicted of\ndisciplinary offences. This is to\nbe the Senior Warden, the student Halls Rep. on Council, and\na Warden not involved in the\ndispute, with the final right of\nappeal being to the Rector. Appeals must be within 48 hours.\nOn Frank Fuchs' insistence, Ray\nPhillips promised to get confirmation of the right of students to\ntake witnesses before the Board.\nDeputy President Martin Lack\ngave details of new furniture for\nthe Upper Lounge, new curtains\nRob Collinge ; elected unopposed\nfor the Concert Hall, new bar\ncarpet for Southside, etc., followed by Malcolm Duckett's suggestion of a new executive for\nICU and Les Ebdon's era~k\" Why not re-cover the old one?\"\nMuch laughter at this and at Ray\nPhillips' inevitable riposte.\nThe Left Wing of the Union\nthen swung into action with complaint from Les Ebdon, Chairman of the Socialist Society,\nabout some publicity for the\nUnion meeting which seemed to\nimply that ICU dissociated itself\nfrom rallies and similar action on\nstudent affairs. Phillips dealt\nwith this rather ineffectively and\nEbdon went on to inquire about\nIC's policy on grants. In reply\nto this, pert not-yet-blonde-again\nBabs Hedge, of the External\nAffairs Committee, said that as\nthere had not been a quo rate Union meeting recently she had\nbeen unable to get a definite\npolicy statement on the line to\ntake. Not exactly a solid excuse\nbut she added that, up to now,\nthey had been public ising and\nsupporting NUS activities.\nFinally, Derek Boothman,\nChairman of the Communist\nSociety, asked what had happened about the'proposed visit of\nDow Chemicals, who are thought\nto make napalm for use in Vietnam, to the college. The President stated (as reported elsewhere\nin Felix) that he had consulted\nthe Rector and because of the\nrisk of adverse publicity if the\nvisit went ahead, it had been\ncancelled. At this news Mr.\nBland proposed that the Rector\nbe congratulated on his dec i soon, but this was lost in the ensuing\npolitical squabble as Bill Doris\nimmediately challenged the\nquorum before a vote could be\ntaken. Surely the most petty way\na quorum has ever been chal-leng ed. And so we wait until next term\nfor the constitutional amendments to be debated\u2014if they\never are.\n\n"

Soc.\nbut won, ironically enough, by\nMike Beck of Civil I, who projected his winning entry with\nmore vigour than a cro dynamic\nprecision. The competition was\nwatched in sheer bewilderment\nfrom the Electrical and Civil Departments\u2014and in sheer terror as\nthe revolutionary circular entries\nfrom Bill Caruthers and Mike\nClay collided with various distant buildings at high velocity,\nwinning their designers a special\nprize for ingenuity.\nLast Thursday was the Field\nCup which, after much confusion\nand battle, was tied between the\npugnacious combatants from\nMech.

The first prize\nis a colour TV which should interest a lot of people. There is\nalso a prize to the person selling\nthe most tickets. It must be mentioned that Jez has been supporting Carnival.

Last week, Felix\nreporter Pat Rotheram spoke to him at his house in Fulham. At\nthe time he was in bed with bis \" third damn cold this winter,\" feeling\nfar from scintillating.\nUSA& PIRATE EXPERIENCE\nJohn began work as a DJ five years ago. He was in America\ndoing stations in Texas, Oklahoma, and California. At the time the\nBeatles started, he was called upon to be a Beatle expert, \" doing\nresearch on the colour of Paul McCartney's eyes, and other vital\nissues.\" When he left America he joined Radio London. After London\nclosed down, he applied to the BBC, and ended up on \" Top Gear.\"\nHe finds that working for a Civil Service Organisation can be\nfrustrating.\n\" We have to have the records\nfor the show chosen by Thursday\nnight, so we can get the morning\norders printed. It takes two producers and two secretaries and a cast of thousands a whole week to\nget it together. On the pirates we\nused to grab an arm load of\nrecords and go down and play\nthem.\"\nUnion red tape\nHe has strong views on the\nmusician's union.\n\"Their insistence on limiting\nthe amount of needle time available on BBC destroys creativity,\nas groups have to play safe to\nsurvive, even now.\nIt appears to be an entirely self\ndestructive organisation, and this\nthing about not being able to use\nsession musicians on recordings is\nso ludicrous, it means an awful\nlot of musician's union people are\ngoing to be put out of work. Most\nof the guys learned to play a bugle\nin 1944. They came out of the\narmy casting around for an occupation and so they joined the\nunion, and went to play in a pit\norchestra in Workington; and\nthese are the people who set the\npolicies: It's living death, really.\"\nTy ran nos aur us\nRex\nWe talked for a while about Ms\nshow, and how he picks the\ngroups to appear on it. His aim\nis to place good groups in front\nof the public, and get them recorded if he can; to get people\nlistening to their L.P.s, and possibly to buy l item as well. The\ngroups on Top Gear do double\nJohn Wesley\nHarding\n\" John Wesley Harding,\" is, in its own way, as significant a step\nfor Bob Dylan, as Sergeant Pepper was for the Beatles. Both albums\ncontain a good deal that owes nothing to their predecessors; both\nwere, at the time of their issue, unique in one or other of their\naspects. Yet while Sgt. Pepper was the peak of a process of increasing\nsophistication in Lennon and McCartney, the new L.P. by Dylan\nrepresents a definite break with his earlier work. It is notable for its\nlack of passion; for the short anecdotal style of each song; for the\nrestrained and uniform backing. Furthermore it is notable for the\nway it blends the idioms of \" folk-rock \" (to coin a phrase) and\ncountry-and-western music to produce something entirely new. Overall it has the relaxing lazy style of country-and-western, but on the\nother hand the lyrics are something of an improvement on the \" I love\nyou because\" line. Added to this there is the totally distinctive\nquality of Dylan's voice and his squeaky coarse harmonica. While\nthe harmonica is unchanged, Dylan's voice has altered, become softer\nand more measured; he tends to \" sing \" much more than he did\nbefore.\nSo what does the L.P. contain? Twelve short songs, mostly in\nthe form of anecdotes or short stories. Some are fanciful, some\nserious; they have a kind of Aesop-fable sound to them. The first line\nof the first song is enough to emphasise how Dylan's lyrics have\nchanged : \" John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.\" The\naggressive harshness has gone, and what we have instead is a series\nof calm, withdrawn, sometimes wry comments on the way people are,\nand the way they act. One of the best numbers is \" I pity the poor\nimmigrant \" in which, although his terminology is vague (the word\n\" immigrant \" could be possibly replaced by \" self-seeker \") the meaning comes across clearly. Incidentally the most tuneful track, it is based\non \" Come all ye tramps and hawkers \"\u2014a traditional folk ditty.\nIn two other good songs, \" Ballad of Frankie Lee \" and \" Lonesome\nHobo.\" Aesop-Dylan goes so far as to hand the listener his moral on a plate\u2014which makes a change. Throughout, the L.P. is full of nice\ntouches : lines like \" It's not a house, said Judas Priest . . . it's a home!\" and in \" Dear Landlord \" \" I hope that you receive it well,\ndepending on the way you feel that you five,\" show that Dylan has\nnot lost his touch as a lyricist; and the last two numbers, including\n\" I 'll be your baby tonight\" with lazy steel guitar, must be the most\nrelaxing, soothing tracks recorded for some time.\nIn general, and as an integrated whole, the L.P. is very good, and\nwell worth buying (if you like that sort of thing). No one number is\noutstanding; they should be all heard together. Superficially very\nsimple, it is the most mature thing Dylan has done. How much he has\nbeen affected by the accident in which he broke his neck, is impossible\nto say, but his first recordings, eighteen months later, have been worth\nwaiting for,\nJOHN MULL ALY recording sessions, and John\nt lun ks that the extra time put into\nthis slums in the quality of the\nmusic. One of the groups w li ich has appeared on Top Gear is\nTyrwviosaurus Rex.\n\" I first met Mark when I came\noff London. There were four in\nthe group at one time, but he\nfinally decided to settle for just\nhim an il Steve. I thought at the\ntime that he had a very strange\nvoice and could really do quite\nwell if given the exposure.\nGroup\npromotion\nSince then I 've been working\nquite hard on giving them expo-sure. The extraordinary thing is,\nwith the pop music business being\nwhat it is, nobody believes I'm doing it for nothing. You know,\nthey think I'm either managing\nthem or I 've got some violent\nhomosexual relationship with\nMark or something. It's very\nsick, nobody can accept that anyone does anything for anyone\nwithout getting paid for it.\n\" They've got a single coming\nout, which I really think can be a hit record. Mark's voice is so\nextraordinary, it's a bit of an\nacquired taste. He's written a song called \" Deborah\" which\nthey're going to record tomorrow,\nwhich is fantastic. It's very much\na Tyrannosaurus Rex song which\ncoincidentally is very commercial.\nI'd like to see them on \" Top of\nthe Pops.' Be a change from the\nTroggs and people like that\u2014\nDave Dee and his kinky whip\ncracking s.\" Mostly it's groups I see working somewhere who are good, or\ngroups who make nice records.\nSometimes the producer puts\nsomeone on who horrifies me.\nBrenton Wood was on one week\nand I had to introduce something\ncalled the 'Qogum-Boogum song,'\nthe thought of which still strikes\nme cold. I suppose my greatest\nsuccess was with Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band, because their L.P. almost got into\nthe L.P. charts, which is purely\non the strength of my praying and\npromoting them. Nobody else\nseemed to be bothered.\n\" I rate the Incredible String\nBand very highly indeed. They're\nconstantly progressing, you know,\ntheir ideas are getting nicer and\nnicer. They've got a new LP\ncoming out, called ' the Hangman's Beautiful Daughter' which\nis incredibly good.\"\nDisc Jockey John Peel\nRock Revival\nThe conversation veered round\nto pop music in general. Saying\nthat f/ op music seemed extremely\nturgid at the moment, I asked him\nabout the \" rock revival \" which\nDJ's seemed to be babbling about\nevery lime I turned on the radio.\nDid he consider it as a serious attempt to inject life into the music,\nor a serious attempt to sell more\nrecords?\n\" The rock and roll thing was\npart of an entire sub-culture and\nyou can't recreate the conditions\nwhich gave rise to it in the first\nplace. You'll end up with an\nemasculated version of the\noriginal thing. No, I think popular music is in the position that\npainting was at the turn of the\ncentury. You have one load of\npeople doing chocolate-box\ncovers\u2014your Englebert Humperdincks. And then you have people\nwho are trying to do some worthwhile things, without over intel-lect u a lising it, which is the great\ndanger. People listen to something\u2014Dylan particularly\u2014and\ntend to over-interpret it. Even\nL.P. sleeves\u2014it's ridiculous, isn't it? There are many people\nmaking good music now who are\nignored, because the British\npublic has this great craving for\nthe mediocre, because they don't want to become involved. It's not\njust the Mums and Dads who are\ndashing out to buy Englebert, it's the kids too, which is rather\ndispiriting.\"\nLiverpool poets\nWhile Jolm ate a small meal\nincluding a fork-shattering attempt at some frozen cottage\ncheese, we talked about his home\ntown of Liverpool. He doesn't get up there now as often as he\nwould like to . He is a friend of\nseveral of the \" Liverpool Poets,\"\nBob Dylan Photo courtesy of CBS Records Ltd'.\nAdrian Henri, Roger McGough,\nAndy Roberts, Mike Evans, and\nMike Hart. I told him I'd heard\nBrian Patten at a poetry reading\nlast year, and been very imp res sed. John hadn't met him, as\nhe's moved away from Liverpool.\nSeven of them have formed a group, calling themselves ' The\nLiverpool Scene.' Combining\npoetry and music, ti vey play as a jug band, a rock band, and with\n\"Adrian reading px je try to Andy's extended guitar improvisations.\"\nI asked him if he thought tli ey would make a large impact on\npopular culture.\nI'm hoping they will. The\nbook (The Liverpool Scene) sold\nquite well, and I think this poetry\nand song thing is going to grow,\nbecause there are so many poets\nwho are recording at the moment.\nPete Brown's got a poetry band,\nand Leonard Cohn has this LP,\nwhich is beautiful. I think Donovan is a poet, and I think Mark\nis in his own way. It's becoming\nincreasingly difficult to say who's a poet and who's a song writer\nwhich is good.\n\" There's an LP coming out\ncalled \" McGough and McGear.\"\nIt's got a thing which Paul McCartney produced, with Roger\ndoing \" Summer with Monika \"\naccompanied by Andy. This\ntraces a relationship and the\nmusic does as well : it's very\neffective and I'd like to see it\nhappen more often.\"\nDONOVAN Donovan hasn't appeared in\nEngland since his Saville Theatre\nconcert about a year ago. When\nDonovanfirstappeared, I said,\nmany people thought he was Bob\nDylan carbon-copy; but surely no\none thought so these days.\n\" No. Well, he's such a nice\nguy, which is good. I'm a bit\ndisillusioned with everybody at\nthe moment, even the Beatles.\nTheir new record is such a bring-down. I can well live without ever\nhearing it again. You can talk to\nDonovan as an ordinary, friendly\nperson, he doesn't put on any airs\nor anything. I was most impressed\nwhen I met him. I thought somebody who writes such nice things\nand has such nice ideas couldn't possibly be like that in person.\nAnd he is really, just like his\nsongs.\"\n/ mentioned Donovan's recent\nradio interview, when he talked\nabout the concert.\n\" He's run into problems with\nhis management. You know,\nthey're going to insist he gets\npaid some enormous amount, and\nand they won't let him donate the\nmoney to charity, which is a drag.\nBecause I'm sure he'd want to if\nhe could.\"\nAs I left, John Peel was not delighted with having to do a show\nt lie next day, and threatening suicide if he ever again showed signs\nof becoming ill.\nPAT ROTHERAM\n\n"

There are three possibilities: a stay in Europe,\nNorth America and elsewhere, with elsewhere probably the most expensive and Europe the cheapest The means of approaching these\npossibilities are also three in number: (he hitch-hiking method, the\nautomobile method (try to ensure that the car belongs to your friend\nand not to you), and the public transport method, this last tending to\nbe rather expensive.\nA quick glance through any colour supplement or a hasty leer\nat the bikinis etc. of a travel agent's window is enough to make your\nchoice difficult, are you big enough for the Bahamas?, Malta '68 is the\nMed's fun playground, France this Summer? pas de problem, play\ncowboys on a dude ranch in Canada, Portugal is generous, which\nGreece will you bring back with you ? Nepal gives good vibrations,\nIreland is only two hours away, etc. etc., all these tantalize the\nwould-be traveller's imagination. However from a student's point of\nview there is one hindrance viz. lack of money\u2014never mind a \u00a350\ntravel allowance. There are some student-orientated agencies\u2014who\nfrequently advertise in FELIX\u2014for instance Quo Vadis (who take\nyou as far as \" six-day \" Israel), continental Minitrips and New\nFrontier travel. These are the people to contact for an organised\nmotor trip, and to give you some idea of the cost, New Frontier\ntravel gives you 4 weeks in Greece or Turkey for \u00a355. If you can't dig up the advertisement contact FELIX.\nLSEWHERE\nHolidays in Europe and North\nAmerica are relatively well documented, holidays elsewhere less\nso. A cheap way of seeing a relatively distant part of the world\nis through VSO but this is a lengthy project. Within the scope\nof a summer vacation a few possibilities (if you can afford them)\nspring to mind, Japan for one.\nThis can be reached via the internationally known Trans Siberian\nRailway or (more cheaply) by\nbooking into a BUSTA charter\nflight. It is, of course, best to obtain a job in Japan before you\nget there. India and /or Nepal\nmay well be the next big tourist\ndiscovery not to mention bonus\nspiritual benefits. If you can\ntravel there unassisted, well and\ngood. If not Penn Overland trips\nwill drive you from London to\nCalcutta in two months for a large\nsum of money\u2014\u00a3133 (Penn Overland Tours, 122 Knightsbridge,\nLondon). Africa (or a part there-of) is another largely unexplored\ntourist tract and whether you fly\nto it. sail to it, or take a Land\nRover, Ethiopia is rumoured to'\nbe \" a good place to stay.\" At\npresent, driving there poses problems since the Sudan refuses to\nallow foreigners to drive across\nthe Sudan-Egypt border. If you\nfeel l ike splashing out \u00a3360 you\ncan take a Trans-Sahara Minitrek\nExpedition for all of 34 days\nwhich takes you from Algiers to\nAgades and back. Or you can\nrisk the journey unassisted.\nFor those restless, footloose,\nadventurous nomads among us\nwhose lust for travel will never be\nsatisfied, there are further possibilities : Outer Mongolia, Chile\nand Australia to name but three.\nWhen, if ever, you get there,\nplease send FELIX a postcard\nabout it.\nIn the meantime do not forget\nto take a full supply of ballpoint\npens when travelling through\nRussia. These can be sold at exorbitant prices to peasants all\nalong your route to finance your\njourney. The same goes for\nlots of other capitalist goods, we\nare reliably informed\u2014only, do\nnot get caught.\nAMERICA\nDowntown New York by night\nIt is not too late to joo k flights\nto America with BUNAC this\nyear, providing yr u are at present a member.

These can only be obtained before leaving Britain. An\nAmerican Airlines card may be\nuseful if you are under 22. It\nentitles you to travel half price\n\" standby \" on internal flights in\nthe USA on most major airlines.\nMore about visiting America\nwill appear in the first full issue\nnext term.\nFor those who prefer to go un-restricted, Europe is both the\ncheapest and the most convenient\nplace. Hitchhiking, though becoming less easy each year, is\nvery possible though a trifle arduous; it's also free. France is\nreckoned to be difficult (though it\nis said that waving a Union Jack\nhelps,) while Italy is relatively\neasy. Ease of hitchhiking in other\ncountries varies between the two\nRussia; the\nthe Crimea.\nSwallow's Nest in\nEUROPE\nextremes. Where you go depends\non what you want, but in general\nFrance is unrewarding, apart from\n(say) Paris, les chateaux de la\nLoire, and the South Coast.\nSwitzerland is very beautiful complete with jangling cows and the\nEiger but tends to be expensive.\nItaly particularly the northern\nhalf is a good place to go, also\nexpensive but contains interesting\nhistorical items viz, the Colliseum\netc., and scenically the Dolomites\nin the North East compare very\nwell with the rest of the Alps. The\nthree good places in Europe\n(leaving aside Scandinavia) are\nAustria, Yugoslavia and Greece.\nAustria and Yugoslavia are both\ncheap, and bought meals are\nlarge. Austria boasts the Tyrol,\nand Yugoslavia its Mediterranean\ncoastline. The inland section of\nYugoslavia is dull, hot and Belgrade is particularly unrewarding;\nbut the coastline scattered with\nislands having names such as Krk\nand Hvar is well worth a visit.\nHvar is particularly re com men ded.\nQuite how Greece has changed\nunder a year of military regime\nis difficult to say, but two years\nago it was certainly the best all-round holiday prospect in Europe,\nbeing cheap, very beautiful, featuring superb bathing, the Acropolis, Delphi, Mt. Olympus, and\nvery friendly people. Added to\nthis, the islands of Greece with\nCrete are also very lovely, with\nheaps of white stone masonry\nplaced at irregular intervals about\nthem.\nIf you do not wish to hitch hike\nyou can drive; this means that\nyou don't have to carry everything on your back. On the other\nhand driving long distances is\nvery tiring and boring and a combination of hitchhiking and (stu-dent priced) travel might be pre-fer able. There are advantages to\nboth modes of travel. If you drive\nget hold of a camping car net( it\nsaves money on camp sites) and\nA A3 star insurance is also worth-while. If yon can manage to acquire them Michelin campsite\nguides are very useful and better\nthan the A A equivalent.\nIncidentally if you happen to\npass through Tournus in Central\nir ran ce stop off and buy some\nhome-made honey there\u2014it is\ntruly excellent.\nGREECE and TURKEY34 days\n29 guineas\nCoach Camping Expedition Departure dates: June 2 6, July31, Miss E.
