    "content": "2 FELIX PhOFlLt\nTHE PRESIDENT AS STUDENT ORATOR LAST YEAR\nR.H. T. GARNETT\nRichard High-Tension Garnett waa,\nin common with many of lis, born and\npursued a relatively orthodox career\nbefore entering I.C. some years ago.\nHe is now engaged (academically) to a Cornish tin-mine; we hope that they\nwill be very happy and perhaps one day\nproduce some high-grade ore.\nSecretary of the Union last year,\nHigh-Tension has the stature of many a present-day dictator - being neither\ntall nor thin. If looking far the\nPresident, don't let the dizzy heights\nof his Office mislead you into looking\non too high a plane: 5ft. will oat oh him right between the eyes. In his\nyouth he played rug ger but now prefers\nto conserve his energy for other pur-suits.\nHis o or pu leno e has further\nincreased since his acquisition of a motor-a ooo ter. But, chubby though he\nmay be, women have oft been known to\no all him handsome. Besides being\npossessed of a ready charm and wit, he\ncan also be a a i ao he i vous imp, as hostel\nresidents since 1956 know to their oost.\nAlthough more at ease in a baseball cap, tartan shirt and mining\nboots (he considers trousers a luxury) - HT* s urbane handling of a sherry glass is unparalleled and his\nformal speeches masterful.\nPeculiarities:HT has a predilection for a raw\ncarrot, wh i oh he considers as one of\nNature's bounteous gifts.\nHT, among a wealth of original\nthought*, is a firm adherent to the\nbelief that the Death-Watch Beetle\nia here to stay.\nHowever, an impression of Richard\nas a playboy would belie his prodigious\ncapacity for hard work and his ruthless\nefficiency: two essential qualities\nwh i oh ensure a successful Presidency.\nOFF TO PERU When we read about expeditions to\nfar off places, many of us wish that\nwe too could climb the highest mountains or tread the icy wastes of Polar\nregions. However, for the great majority the dreams are never realised\nowing to lack of opportunity. Those\nof us at Imperial College are more fortunate than most because the opportunity\nfor exploration does exist.\nTowards the end of 1955 a body\nknown as the Imperial College Exploration Board was formed to sponsor expeditions of a scientific and adventurous nature, proposed by members of\nthe college: students or staff, men\nor women. The Board, wh i oh meets two\nor three times each session under the\nchairmanship of Prof. H.H. Read, has a membership representing the teaching\nstaff, the Unions and the old students\norganisations. It has an income of\n\u00a31200 per year provided by the college\nand I.C. Union and it has discretion to\naward grants to proposed expeditions as\nit sees fit. Last year for example,\nit gave its support to expeditions which\nspent the summer vacation in places as\nwidely separated as Ghana, Iceland and\nNorway. It must be emphasised, however\nthat the support of the Board must be\nbought as early as possible, especially\nfor the more ambitious proposals.\nEXTRA MURAL TOUCHSTONE\nTouchstone is the occasion when\nserious topics are discussed at lei sure in the congenial surroundings of\nI.C.'s Country House at Silwood Park:\nthis term has two such week-ends.\nThe first, on November l st and 2nd, with \"The Problem of Force\" as the\nsubject, should prove extremely con-t rovers i al, the main speaker being\nR.H. S. Crosaman, O.B.E., M.P., well-known for his lively oratory: the\nsecond, to be held on December 6th and 7th, will consider \"Second Thoughts\non Marxism\", under the guidance of\nProf. H. Levy of the Maths. Dept.\nGENERAL STUDIES\nThe General Studies this term again\ncover a wide range of subjects, and\nare given by a number of well-known\nspeakers. Of special interest may be\nmentioned a series of lectures on\nvarious aspects of Nuclear Warfare,\nincluding radiation hazards and the\nmilitary implications of the H bomb:\nthe speakers on these topics will inc lude Prof. Dame Kathleen Lonsdale and\nSir George Thomson.\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer,\nthe St. Hon. Heathcoat Amory, M.P. will be giving his hopes and fears for\nour future, and a subject of wide and\nnever-failing interest, \"Modern Marriage\", will be discussed by D.J. Bredahaw, the Sec of the Hat. Marriage\nGuidance Council.\nAntony Hopkins will continue his\nseries of talks on the appreciation\nof a main, and those interested in\npoetry, sculpture end ballet will also\nbe well catered for.\nOne such proposal was discussed by\nthe Board last April: it is intended\nthat a party of six should visit the\nNudo de Apolobamba on the Peru-Bolivia\nborder in the summer of 1959. Preliminary approval was given to the scheme\nand preparations are under way. Present indications are that the programme\nwill include geology, surveying and\no limb ing, although the details will not\nbe de oid ed until the party has been\nselected. Further applications for\nmembership will be considered if they\nare sent ii m ned i at ely to Mr G. Bratt,Room\n113, Physacal Chemistry R.C.S. or Mr W. Melbourne, Aero.\nThe Peru Expedition will absorb a considerable proportion of the funds\nwh i oh the Board will have available this\nyear but it is hoped that there will be\nsomething left for one or two smaller\nexpeditions. Decisions about next\nyear's expeditions will be made at the\nnext meeting of the Board which will\ntake place at the end of this term.\nProposals must be submitted to the Hon.\nSec. (Mr P.F. Taylor, Civil Eng.) not\nlater than November 14th. Detailed\ninstructions about submitting proposals\nto the Board will be posted on the Exploration Society not ioe board in the\nUnion.\nP. F.T. THE VANISHING\nPHOTOGRAPHER It is my painful duty to report and\nexplain an unfortunate incident which\nwill mar for acme the memory of last\nsession's President's Ball. A photographer had been hired to cover the\nevent in the usual way, and during the\ncourse of the evening he flashed away\nindustriously so that he and his lady\nassistant took a considerable number\nof cash orders. A few weeks later it was obvious from the complaints received that this photographer did not intend\nto send his customers the prints they\nhad payed for, and a visit to his address soon confirmed this. He had, it transpired, disappeared shortly after\nJune 20th the date of the Ball - leaving many creditors po un\\ ing at the\ndoor, and needless to say, the police\nwere looking for him.\nThe matter is now entirely in the\nhands of the police, so there is little we can do at the moment. I would like\nhowever to get some idea of how much\nmoney was involved, and I would be gi\u00bbdi fall who placed orders, including\nthose who did receive some prints,would\nlet me have details so that I can pass\nthe information on to the polio e. My predecessor, Gil Streets, joins\nme in offering sincere apologies to\nthose who were victims of the fraud. I should point out, especially to Freshers\nthat we have never had a crooked photographer before, and I shall do ay beat\nto ensure that we never have another.\nJohn Sheldon\nChairman Entertainments Committee\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 5\nPRESIDENTS MESSAGE The Freshmen coming up to Imperial\nCollege this year are most fortunate\nin that they are arriving at a time of\ncomparative peace; a peace unequalled\nduring the past three years. Admittedly the new Physics Block on the corner of Prince Consort Road is in the\nprocess of being built, and in addition\nPrince's Gardens are rapidly changing\ntheir appearance but the Union building is now complete and free from the\nexperiments of civil engineers.\nThe amenities provided by the Union\nare not produced by the wave of a wand,\nas so many appear to be in this modern\nwelfare state, but by members them sel v es. Since, then, the Union Building belongs to all the students, I would ask\nthem to treat it with care and to govern their conduct throughout the Union\nwith a liberal measure of common-sense,\nfor it is the policy here to have as\nfew rules as possible.\nThis general principle applies also\nin the academic life where work is not\naltogether compulsory. The student\ntherefore has to strike a compromise\nbetween his academic and non-academic\nactivities. Very soon he realises\nthat although he comes to college to\nobtain a degree, this is not the only\nqualification to assist him in his later\ncareer. Therefore I would implore every Freshman to make the greatest possible us* of the opportunities provided\nfor social life and athletic activity\nwithin the Union. It has been said\nthat the student who does nothing but\nwork from 10am. to 5pm. every day, and\npursues no other interest,is a fool.\nHowever I would like to add that one\nwho takes advantage of his new-found\nfreedom and does nothing but play, finally failing his exams, is a greater\nfool by far. The secret perhaps is to\ntackle everything with the utmost energy\nomitting nothing.\nOne complication of life at I.C. is the dual responsibility which each student holds. For example, I.C. has the\nfinest reo or d of any college within the\nUniversity of London, and each student\nshould be proud to be a member of this\nUnion. At the same time, however,\nhe must remember that he is also a mem ber of the constituent college Unions,\nIt is from the latter that the I.C. Union draws its strength and they most\nnot be forgotten.\nA word to the post-graduate Freshmen; after three or more years at another University they may be rather\ntired of student affairs, but we would\nnot like them to retire from the Union\nlife for we can learn so much from them\nin a college which has one of the highest percentages of post-graduate students in the oo un try. Finally, Union Officers have encountered exactly the same problems as the\nFreshmen and are only too willing to\nhelp. If therefore you have any problems or criticisms do not hesitate to\ncontact one of the Union Officers,\neither by writing or by calling personally at the Union Office under the arch-way.\nR.H. T.G. THE SOCIAL WHIRL On entering College life Freshers\nfind a bewildering number of social\nevents confronting them and often the\nmental confusion caused by this deters\nthem from taking advantage of the\navailable opportunities.\nThe most prominent events are the\ndances and dinners. Every Saturday\nnight there is a 'Hop' usually organised\nby one of the many I.C. societies.\nFormal Dances are run periodically: the\nCommemoration Ball is normally held at\nClaridges while the Mines, Engineers'\nand the Country House Ball (R.C.S.) are held within the College as also is the I. C.W. A. Formal Dinner and Danoe.\nAt the other extreme ere the most in formal Carnivals organised by the 3\nconstitute nt Colleges of I.C. Dinner in Hall is held every Tuesday evening, designed to encourage mare\npersonal contact between staff and stu-dents. There are two Wine Hal] Dinners.\nPeriodically the I.<3. Dram. Soo.\nproduces plays while the I.C. Musio Soo.\norganises recitals and o ono ert s of\nvery high quality.\nThe R.C.S. Smoking Concert, a function reviewing departmental tal ent, is a must for R.C.S.. The only 'official' rag day is\nMorphy Day, the day of boat racing on\nthe Thames at Putney. For those who\nobserve the annual Nov. 5th 'warning'\nthere are organised fireworks at Harlington while far those to wham the\n'warning' means nothing the fireworks\ndisplay at Trafalgar Square is worthy\nof recommendation.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE BOOKS TALL INSTRUMENTS BLAZERS\nTEXTBOOKS SCARVES\nJOIN THE I.C. CHOIR. NELSON If you expect me, like the rest of\nthe shower who write this thing,to\nexude platitudes to Freshers, you're\nway off the beam.\nPersonally I 've no sympathy with\nthem, but as long as they go back\nto Ealing at five o 'clock with their\nlittle brown bags s nd keep away\nfrom the Bar, I tolerate them.\nA block in Prince's Gardens was swept\nby fire the other day.

In due course he got a First, so he became a professor and seduced his secret-ary.\nRECENT VIEW OF IMPERIAL\nRUINS\nTHE HALO A NE LIBRARY Have you ever heard of the H \u00abI Library? Most people haven't. The\nold Union library, wh i oh consisted\nmainly of fiction,has been greatly enlarged during the last nine years with\nthe aid of generous grants from Touchstone. These have been primarily devoted to reinforcing the non-fiction\nsections, and as a result the college\nnow possesses a balanced collection\nto suit every conceivable taste.\nHoused off the Guilds library in the\nUnwin building and renamed after a distinguished member of the college, the\nlate Lord Haldane, the library awaits\nto amuse and to educate. It is now\nunder the control of a joint committee\nof students and staff with strong financial support from both college and\nUnion. Mr A.G. Quinsee B. A.,F.I \u00bbA. is the full time librarian and the hours\nof opening are from I to 5p.m. each\nweekday.\nEvery conceivable interest is catered for. Amongst recent additions is' A Treasury of Ribaldry' ed. by L. Untermeyer, or on a slightly more sophisticated plane, the complete works of\nArthur Miller and Eugene O 'Neill. For\nthe tongue-tied, 'English Love Poems'\nmay provide some assistance, as might\nthat best-selling collection of American Folklore -'The Kinsey Report'albeit a little ragged at the edges.\nAmong the seemingly unending stream\nof war-books, 'Arnhem' by Major General\nUrquahart is noteworthy, as is Hitler's Youth' by Franz Jetzinger. The recently issued 'Concerto and Symphony' in the\nPhoenix Music Guides series is excellent\nin its field. If you prefer to take\nyour science from the 'Tele',Patrick\nMoore's 'The Amateur Astronomer' will\nbe familiar. The series on the History of Technology is, surprisingly en-ough, worth browsing into, and Herman\nOberth's 'Man into Space'makes absorbing reading.\nFor those interested in hobbies\nother than the above 'The Art of Cricket'\nby Bradman is vastly superior to the efforts of Len and Dennis; \"The Focal\nEncyclopaedia of Photography', a 'Sail-ing Premier1\nby W.D. Pork and the 'Log-ical approach to Chess' by Blaire and\nRumble are also recommended. The\nGuinness Book of Superlatives will inflate your ego in the Bar.\nOthers wh i oh come to mind in a necessarily personal choice are 'The Church\nin Russia' by Spinka and the vicious\n\u2022Parkinson's Law or the Pursuit of Progress'. But even if you cannot read\nat all, don't fret. We have a useful\nReference Atlas of Greater London, and,\neven if this is a little hard, a series\nof jolly picture travel books of Greece,\nTurkey, etc.\nLast year's membership reached 468,\nof wh i oh40 were staff. This leaves\nover 80 % of the college taking no advantage of the facilities offered then\nto amuse, educate and broaden their\nminds in the true spirit of University\nlife. Our hope is to make the library the centre of all that distinguishes us from a correspondence course\n- why not use it? P.H. G. Draper.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX3 EXPLORATION IN OS A. In November 1957 the I.C. Exploration Board was approached, on behalf\nof a group of 2nd year Botanists and\nZoologists, with a view to obtaining\nfinancial aid for a proposed scientific\nexpedition to northern Norway. Offici al support was eventually received in\nthe following April, fortunately much\nof the major organisation had been completed by this date.\nAt the request of the Board the\nparty was restricted to nine persons,\nincluding two girls. The original\nplan, to travel north to Hammerfest,\nhad been abandoned due to prohibitive\nexpense and a fresh objective, Osa in\nHardanger, was a oo ep ted. A multitude of oases left for Newcastle in mid-July, and the party fol lowed on the 21st, sailing for Bergen,\nhappy in the fulfillment of eight months Optimistic speculation. The two\ndays Journey forged, link by link, x chain of disjointed memories. The\nfilth of the Tyne; mountains and seagulls in the sunlight; the great\nbridge at Haugesund; torn hands on\ntea-o he3 ts;a sick feeling as kilo\nafter kilo of equipment was charged\nfor freight age at a fabulous rate;\nBergen rain; snow-o app ed peaks mirrored\nin calm water; the fjord-side road\nterminating in a heap of shattered\nrock a few metres from Osa; infinite\nhunger.\nOsa, a small hamlet of farm steads, lay at the head of Osafjord, he nme d in\nby prodigious peaks. Torrential rivers\nraced through two valleys wh i oh ran\ninland from the village and our ears\nwere never free from the thunder of\ncascading water. The base o amp beside the smaller river was situated on\nthe valley floor a mile above the village, in a clearing of the alder wood-land. Towering to two thousand feet\nabove were the shear rook walls, friendly in the sun but dark and forbidding\nin the mountain mist.\nDuring the first night torrential\nrain fell and by morning, with the\ngirls almost afloat, it was obvious that\nat least three of the tents were somewhat less than waterproof. The day\nwas spent erecting make-shift fly sheets, which proved to be invaluable\nas there were but eight rain less days\nin the following five weeks.\nOSA FJORD. C The almost incessant rain of the E first week indicated that good weather Q could not be expected and we soon q became reconciled to the prospect of\nconstantly wet boots and damp clothing. A Despite the adverse conditions, so ie nTt if io work went ahead with little inter- -Lr up tion and a vast volume of data was rv\ncollected. Of this, more detail\nwill appear in the report to the Exploration Board,and there is the p ossi bC ili ty of a paper being published.\nOn the third day two of the party\nexplored the head of the valley; the\ngreatest height reached was 3900 ft. where the lake feeding the river was\nfound to be heavily ice-covered and\nsurrounded by extensive snow fields.\nThe northern face of Vass Fjoro, the\nregion's highest peak, although snow-covered, appeared o limb able. However,\ndue to the distances and o limbs in vol ved, it was evident that any scientific\nwork at high altitudes would have to be\no on duo ted from an advance camp.\nThere was very little personal\nfriction in the o amp, even at times\nwhen morale was lowered by the evil\nweather. Few o or a plaints were voiced\nabout general conditions, o amp duties\nor, most important of all, food,\nalthough finally the consumption of\n'Ryvita* sandwiches, nut, banana and\nfruit bars became somewhat of an\neffort; The presence of the two\ngirls added a moderating influence and\nled to the cultivation of the art of\nambiguous statement. One never to\nbe forgotten comment (from a woman\nnaturally) was:- \"He came into the\ntent and attempted to remove my py j a mas!\" (?) a They appeared obsessed\nwith the removal of clothing (not their\nown!) end on one occasion ao ert a in young woman, holder of high office,\nsprained her thumb during the theft of\nmy best er ease less trousers.\nNEEDLE John R. Etherington.\na Editor's query.\nAs the new oo lle ge year starts, one\nis more conscious of many facts that\nbecome a oo ep ted as a normal and integral part of oo lle ge life as the year\npasses. One of these is the extremely\nni\u00bbn number of women in a predominately male oo lle ge. This is alone a major problem in some ways because it is unnatural to, have numbers so out of\nproportion. Ignoring the side of the\nquestion which demands an increase in numbers of women and discusses how to\nmake this possible, this leaves the\nother side which considers what part\nthe women can or should play.\nJudging by numerous conversations\nand quoted remarks, the average man\nconsiders the women at I.C. as creatures\nto be feared, avoided and ignored as\nfar as possible. He will condemn\nthem without knowing them and if by\nchance confronted with any favourable\nfacts (or otherwise) the retort is\nmerely 'women' with a shrug of the shoulders and the matter is dismissed.\nThis is luckily not true of many who\nwork hard for the oo lle ge in o lub s and\nsocieties but these latter are very\nmuch in the minority.\nWhat is the answer then to this\nsituation? To break down this barrier\nof indifference, a woman has to choose\nher path o are fully. If 3he attempts\nto be friendly, there is the danger of\nbeing thought forward. If she leaves\nothers to make the first step, it is never made, and she is either dismissed\nas dull, stupid or morbidly shy. Some\npeople may say that there is no need\nfor this barrier to be broken down at\n\u00bbli but surely that is denying one of\nthe fundamentals of a University education - the freedom to mix and meet\nall types of people on a oom ra on ground.\nIt appears then that the only path left\nfor the women to follow is to be plea-sant, well dressed and as easy to get\non with as possible thus shifting part\nof the burden on to the men.\nIf the men would only approach the\nproblem with open minds and be willing\nto alter their opinions the situation\nwould soon be radically altered. This\nis not an attempt to throw all the\ninitiative on to the men as the women\nmust play their part. If both sides\nhowever could play their part, the\nbenefit that they would then obtain\nwould be immeasurable.\nJ.T. S.

W.S.C. labours\nunder the handicap of being a comparative handful. The courage and enthusiasm with which they compete in many\nsports earns, deservedly, the admiration of the entire College.\nThe Rugger, Soccer and Hockey Clubs\nhave reported very successful seasons.\nThe Rugby Club won the U.L. Cup, for\nthe fifth time in seven years, and\nenjoyed another fabulous tour of Prance.\n\"Despite hospitality wh i oh proved, in\ncertain oases, overwhelming, Saintes\nwere beaten 6-3 and the matches with\nScarlat and Royan drawn 3-3 before large\nand appreciative crowds. Attempts\nto drink the whole I.C. party under the\ntable were repulsed with heavy losses\non both sides, but far heavier on the\nFrench side\".\nThe Soccer Club second, third, and\nfourth teams all won their respective\ndivisions of the U.L. League.\nThe Hookey Club provided 6 members\nof the U.L. first team, but still lost\nonly 5 on their 29 first XI matches.\nOutstanding feature of the season was\nthe Dutch tour. I.C. played in the\nDutch Universities tournament and somewhat embarrassed everyone by reaching\nthe final. However they kept AngloDutch relations completely amicable by\na diplomatic withdrawal in favour of\nthe team they had beaten in the semi-final, who went on to win the champion-ship.\nThe Boat Club have also had a fine\nyear, bringing yet more silver-ware\nto the Trophy case. In the Head of\nthe River, I.C. moved up 4 places to\n12th. We must mention the outstanding\nsculling of Martin Geylard, who finished\n7th in the scull ers* Head, following\nthis by magn if io ent wins in the Willesden, Chiswiok and Walton regattas.\nThe Cross-country Club gained an\neasy vio tory in their U.L. Championships, and provided the individual\nwinner in John Evans. In the Hyde\nPark Road Relay, I.C. dipped 50 seconds off the record, but were narrowly\nbeaten into second place by Liverpool\nUniversity.\nThe Athletic Club was just pipped\nin the U.L. Sports by U.C.,9$ points\nto 95.\nA dub with a really outstanding\nrecord ia the Rifle Club, wh i oh entered\n16 teams in 13 different divisions of\nvarious leagues, obtaining 9 first\nplaces and 5 second.\nBoth tha Swimming Club and the\nBoxing Club won their U.L. Championships, the latter sharing their trophy with Kings*.\nDEVON CRICKET TOUR. The 15th. Cricket Club tour of Devon\nbegan in the murky mists of Plymouth,\nwhere only one of three fixtures could\nbe played. In thin match I.C. shot\nout the Royal Naval Barracks on a sticky\nwicket for 52 ( Hearn 7-14, in d. hat-trick) and showed a superior batting\ntechnique under such conditions themselves by knocking up the required runs\nin 45 minutes for the loss of 4 wickets\n(Kitchener 23 no.) The weather, the tempo of the or io ket and the evening festivities all improved together ss time went by, culminating in a glorious four days at\nTorquay. A supporters' group of drinking ex-I.C. students arrived on the\nSaturday and inspired the teem to an\neasy vio tory over Uplyme, where Murden\ndumped 75 in an hour ( in d.14 fours)\ntowards the I.C. total of 144. Uplyme\nfell for 76, mainly to Oggi (6-26)\nX.C. hit up 178-5 declared (Kitoh\n48 n.0., Hearn 35, Kapur 30) against\nWhinple, the cider village, and Oggi\ngained further fame by hitting the oak-tree wh i oh flourishes half-way to the\nboundary. This won him the year's dropped catch kitty, amounting to thirty\ntwo \u00abh MH\u00abE \u00ab. which at 6d par cat oh, ia\npretty good going. Since Oggi had contributed no small portion of the kitty\nfrom his own pocket, it was considered\nIronical injustice that he should win\nit all back. Whimple replied with\n111-7 (Logan 5-26) and a joyful evening ensued.\nSo to Torquay, where first an evening match was played against a good\nteam raised by the sporting Torquay\nskipper, J.E. Dickenson. His XX declared at 137-9, but unfortunately I.C.o apt a in Hearn misinformed his tea a aa\nto the finishing time. He tried to\nremedy this by manually altering the\npavilion dock, but was ignored.\nMeanwhile his batsmen, Kitoh\u00abner(5l) and Bartholomew (42 n.o,),mes meri sed and irate at finding everything conspiring against them, tried to pull\nthe game out of the fire, but L.C. had\nto be o on tent with a draw at 129-5.\nOggi' a a en td derangement was the chief\ntopic during the hilarious celebrations\nwhich followed*\nCONDENSED FROM ANNUAL\nA.C.C. REPORT\nThe Squash Club succeeded in winning 20 matches out of 26. The Cricket\nClub and Golfing Association did well,\nbut the Table Tennis, Fencing, Badminton, Sailing and Judo Clubs report\nonly fair years.\nThe A.C.C. \"has given birth to a new Club .... the Basket Bd l Club\nnow exists and has played and won it a first match.\"\nAfter en undistinguished dram with\nBrixham, there came two truly m ago if i \u00a9ent and bard-fought matches with Paignton, especially against the bowling of\nthe professional J. Kelly (Northants)\nHowever, they made 131 (Kitoh 33, Bartholomew 30) and held Paignton to 107-7\nafter an excellent battle of fluctuating\nfortunes.\nA new peak of exo item en to a mein the finale at Torquay, who were put in\nto bat by I.C. and dismissed for 142,\nCarter doing the hat-trick in hie 5-32.\nL.C., with two hours to get the runs,\nstarted badly and were 9-2 after 25\nminutes. However a tenacious sad determined stand by Murden (42) and Kitch\n(68 n.0.) of 87 in73 minutes gave I.C.a winning chance. Amidst mounting ex-cite ment, Hearn and Kitoh added 37 in\ntwenty minutes and I.C. got home with\nthree minutes to spare - our first vio tory over Torquay since 1954 and a fitting\noHm jT to the season.\nThe team owed much of their success\nto their ability to achieve evening relaxation over the foaming glass. Happy reunions with our hospitable Devon\nhosts were followed by debates and discussions until the early hours, often\nculminating in ceremonial paddling etc.\nin Torbay. Freshers who wish to experience this great institution shod d note June 23rd July 3rd in their\ndiaries, in big red letters.\nMARTIN GAY LARD. A member of the I.C. Boat Club,Martin Gay lard, starting the 1958 season\nwith an ambitious but unsuccessful entry in the Wingfield Sculls (Amateur\nChampionships;,ended with victories in\nfour open senior sculls events.\nHaving come seventh in the scull er's Head', he won at Willeaden Regattadao rowing in a successful Junior-senior\ne ox less four - at Chiswiok Regatta from\nG.C. Justios, at Walton and at the Metropolitan Regatta.\nIn the Diaswaoda at Henley, a televised race, he successfully used against\nthe United States o hampi on tactics evolved especially for upsetting adherents to the uniform-pace theory of\nracing. In the semi-find he realised\nthat the Russian Olympic Gdd-faed ali at7. Ivanov, a much faster Soulier, was\nplaying with him and cunningly reserved himself for a vicious sprint up\nthe enclosures, but was beaten in very\nexciting race for wh i oh he got much\npublicity - the distance waa $ length.\nIn the Empire Games trials he was\nnarrowly beaten by S.C. Rand, who also\ndefeated him at Mdsey Regatta, sculling\nthe 6 minute course at an average\nrating of 34,\nTha University of London, in contrast to most Public Schools and rowing universities, appears to consider\nthat it has insufficient t dent to\npromote a sculling race in beet boats.\nMartin Geylard probably confirmed this\nopinion by falling in, when about to\nwin the final of the U.L. Potter cup\nw hio his rose d in rum-turns.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD tm per id College Union S.W.7. Printed by S IL VOUS PLAIT Ltd, 307a, Telephone Place W.14. "

In October 1934\nthe present vehicle was purchased for\n\u00a340 from a blacksmith in Shropshire.\nLike her predecessor,Bo' has participated regularly in the Veteran Car\nClub Brighton Rally and is good for\nmany more.\nShe has two horizontal cylinders,\nlubricated by drip-feed, giving a total\ncapacity of 2464 00s. The inlet\nvalves are automatic and pressure-oper-a ted, while the exhaust are driven by\ncamshaft. Steering is by rack and\npinion; transmission is by chain drive\nwith no differential. The car bure tt or system is somewhat odd and ignition is\nby tremble r coil. Her a noi ent lighting consists of paraffin side and tail and acetylene front lamps.\nIn a \"Felix\" Road Test in May 1953\nBo' registered a speed of\n33 mph, and while her acceleration was\nnot up to modern standards, her braking\nwas rather better. Petrol consumption is12 mpg.\nBOANERGES.\nJezebel is a1916 Dennis fire-tender, used by the London FireBrigade until 1932, when she was\nsold to Crossfields of Warrington,\nthe soap makers, who employed her\nuntil 1955. Somejttme during this\nperiod her pumps were removed and\nshe was subsequently used to tow a mobile pump. In 1955 Crossfields\nvery generously presented her to\nR.C.S. Technically she has a4 cy Under(9,121 oc.) engine w hio his supposed to\nproduce 90 bhp at 1,750 rpm. Suspension is highly dependent - one cart\nspring on each corner and no dampers.\nThe solid tyres, although giving a rough\nride, make steering very light.\nShe has done about 500 miles since\njoining R.C.S., including two trips te\nSilverstone and one to follow the\nBrighton Run. Anyone wanting a rick\nwill be welcome, providing they have\npolished the statutory area of\nbrass.\nCHARIOTS CLEMENTINE\nClementine, the steam traction engine owned by the R.S. M. Union, was made\nin 1919 by Aveling and Porter of Rochester. She was acquired by Mines at\nthe end of October, 1954- Since that\nauspicious occasion Clementine has\nsteamed on R.S. M. and I.C. ventures, and\nher\u2022relations with the Constabulary,\nthough at times strained, are still un inhibiting. The engine weighs 6\u00a3 tons loaded,\nhas solid rubber tyres, and is properly\ntaxed and insured. Two people are required for her effective control, steer-s man and driver. The latter must be\nlicenced under Group A. Maximum\nboiler pressure, raised by \"Welsh dry\nSteam\" coal, is a little below 200 psi.\nTo stop in a hurry, the 3team regulator is shifted so that steam is applied to both sides of the pistons, effectively locking them. Two-speed\ngears are fitted, the engine needing to\n\u2022be stationary in order to change.\nA warning: Should you wish to inspect Clementine when steam is raised,\ndo not stand too o lose. When 'prim-ing' occurs, water that has accumulated-in the cylinders may be shot up the\nchimney, where it picks up large\nquantities of soot - which has a considerable \u2022 fall-out' area.\nJEZEBEL\n1\n\n"
