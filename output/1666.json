We were gonna do a \u2018pagan\nissue\u2019 dedicated to religion, with a graphic\nillustration of the Devil splashed across the\nfront cover. But then in April May announced\na snap general election and we were like\n\u2018God damn\u2019. We forfeited the pagan issue for a\nGE2017 issue, because if we don\u2019t get political who is?\nThere\u2019s only a week left until the general elections.\nIf you haven\u2019t given up all hope and aren\u2019t just tired\nof being made to exercise your democratic right, well\nyou\u2019re gonna love this issue. We\u2019re talking idiot\u2019s guide\nand manifesto analyses, we\u2019re talking comment and\nNHS, we\u2019re talking Imperial poll results, we\u2019re talking\nbingo. Seriously, you\u2019re in for a treat.\nAnd even if you\u2019re sick and tired of democracy,\nmaybe flicking through issue 1666 will motivate yo ass\nto roll off the sofa and down to the polling station and\ncast your vote.\nUs younger voters are often perceived as\ncomplacent, indifferent, resigned (often all three).\nThese are the attributes that seem to be summoned by\nour disappointed forefathers to explain the low voting\nrates amongst their offspring in recent years. Yet this\nlatest general election has acted like a call to arms. On\nthe 22nd\nof May, the last possible day for registration,\nalmost a quarter of a million under-25s registered.\nNow, just over a week later and a week before the\n8th\nof June, the latest YouGov poll is predicting a hung\nparliament \u2013 a parliament wherein no single party has\nachieved majority \u2013 which would be an unexpected\nblow to May and the Conservative party.\nThe poll has come under scrutiny, as YouGov\nemployed a new questionable methodology to arrive\nto these results, but the reality is that until the very last\nvote has been cast and accounted for, everything is\nup in the air.\nRegardless of my political beliefs, I want to say that\nit doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ll vote Conservative,\nLabour, LibDem, Green, Ukip or Women\u2019s Equality\nParty. It might not even matter whether you decide to\nvote at all (despite the centrefold urging you to). As\nlong as you read up and make an educated decision.\nAs long as you make your voice heard. As long as\nyou\u2019re not just giving up your rights.\nSo read up and above all, enjoy.\nT H E\nT E A M\nAddress | felix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB || Telephone | 02075948072 || Printed by | Mortons Media\nGroup Ltd Media Centre, Morton Way, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, LN9 6JR || Registered Newspaper | ISSN 1040-0711 || Copyright\n\u00a9 felix 2016\nEditor-in-Chief | Lef Apostolakis || Deputy Editor | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || News Editor | Matt Johnston, Joanna Wormald || Comment\nEditors | Vivien Hadlow, Tessa Davey, Jonathan Masters || Culture Ringmaster | Fred Fyles || Culture Editors | Indira Mallik, Meryl Anil,\nAnurag Deshpande, Theo Farah, Simran Kukran || Puzzles Editor | Hamish Beck || Clubs & Societies Editor | Abigail de Bruin || Science\nEditors | Lizzie Riach, Ipsita Herlekar || Millennials Queen | Tessa Davey || Millennials Editors | Saad Ahmed, Sanjay Battacharaya, Matt\nJohnston || Sports Editor | Sam Smith || Illustrator | Nathan Macabuag || Copy Chief | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || Copy Editors | Alex Adler\n|| Centrefold | Lef Apostolakis || Front Page | Esther Maltby\n\n"

    "content": "WhyI\u2019mvotingConservative\nA\nnyone who\nthinks that this\nelection is not\nabout Brexit,\nis out of touch\nwith the reality\nof the task ahead. Brexit will be\nlooked upon as a turning point\nin this country\u2019s relationship\nwith its neighbours. Some\nargued that this was the worst\npolitical choice this country has\never made. For a long time, I\nwas one of those people. I\nfound economic security in\nthe status quo and certainty in\nthe confines of a dysfunctional\nEU. However, the way Britain\nhas been treated after Brexit\nby the EU highlights the\ndivergences in the core of the\nEuropean project. For Europe,\nthe EU was an emotional\npeace project after WWII and\nthe end of the cold war. For\nBritain, it was all about trade\nand never about giving up\nsovereignty. In the light of this\ndisturbing EU tone, we must\nforge new trade agreements to\nsecure our future. This country\nwas always a merchant\ntrading country. We need to\nbe where the buyers are and it\nis not Corbyn who is going to\ndeliver these trade deals.\nTherefore, the upcoming\nsnap general election\nconstitutes a larger threat to\nthe welfare of this country. The\noutcome will not only dictate\nwhat kind of future we get\nafter the negotiations, but also\ndefine what sort of country we\nfor nothing. We\u2019d be tied down\nto trade deals with the slowest\ngrowing block of nations in the\nworld, unable to sign any with\nIndia, the US and China. The\nBritish people would also have\nto accept continued freedom\nof movement of EU nationals.\nThis sort of political speech\nmight displease a large part\nof the readership of this\nnewspaper. After all, Corbyn\nis offering a manifesto that\npromises a lot to students\nincluding scrapping tuition\nfees. But Britain cannot\nafford his social economic\nprogramme.\nThis election offers a real\nsettlement Theresa May gets\nwill become law.\nIn contrast, a Labour\ngovernment would certainly\ninclude an SNP alliance,\nguaranteeing a second\nScottish referendum and\neffectively breaking up this\ncountry. This portrays a weak\nand divided Britain.\nTheresa May has made\nher strategy clear and her\nparty has supported her.\nCommandeering a large\nmajority will give her a\nmandate to walk away\nfrom Europe if the Eurocrats\nwant to punish this country.\nMeanwhile, Corbyn lacks\nany political nous, leaving\nus exposed to a European\nproject that wants increased\nfederal rapprochement. He\nis adamant on a Brexit deal,\nstating that no deal \u201cis not a\nviable option\u201d. This increases\nEU leverage, raising the final\n\u2018divorce bill\u2019 beyond \u00a360\nbn. Theresa May could very\nwell walk away and leave\nthe EU with a massive hole\nin its budget. Here lies the\ndifference: she is ready to go\nto extreme extents to secure a\ngooddeal.Hewillcompromise\nto what\u2019s on offer.\nThe EU\u2019s attempts to\ninterfere in this election\nthrough the Downing street\ndinner leaks just show the\nThis is guaranteed with a\nLabour implemented 26%\ncorporate tax, up from the\n17% promised under the\nConservatives. Multinational\nbusinesses are already\nconsidering relocation, this will\nbe the final nail in the coffin.\nFailure to keep businesses will\nmake us look desperate for\na deal and that is the wrong\napproach.\nThis country has achieved\nso much since the 1970\u2019s. Ask\nyour grandparents what that\nera was like, union strikes,\nunemployment. A vote for\nCorbyn is a vote to return to\na bygone era of socialist folly.\nTheresa May offers something\nmore familiar, a more British\nBritain, rather than a divided\none. It is now my firm opinion\nthat a hung parliament will be\nthe most catastrophic political\nand economic decision of\nour generation. The rise and\nfall of this country is on the\nballot box and I am voting\nfor pragmatism over blinding\nsocialist idealism.\nPhilip N. Kurukgy\n\u201cDear diary, today I decided to call an election, I was getting a bit bored\u201d \\\\ Jay Allen\nare.\nThe only way of making a\ndisaster of Brexit would be\nelecting Corbyn. He will most\ncertainly compromise with\nthe EU and sign an EEA type\nof agreement, like the one\nNorway has in place.\nWe would give up our\npolitical influence in Europe\n\\\\ The only way of\nmaking a disaster\nof Brexit would be\nelecting Corbyn \\\\\n\\\\ She is ready\nto go to extreme\nextents to secure a\ngood deal and he\nwill compromise to\nwhat\u2019s on offer \\\\\n\\\\ Corbyn is\noffering to\nscrap tuition\nfees but Britain\ncannot afford his\nsocial economic\nprogramme \\\\\nchoice and two radically\ndifferent visions of Britain. The\nCorbyn choice is to renege\nthe economic achievements\nof the post-Thatcher era, and\nbuild a country based on the\nmost socialist manifesto ever\nproposedwhilesimultaneously\nnegotiating Brexit \u2013 something\nhe will never be able to do.\nBrexit will be a big enough\ntransition and will require a\nunited team with front bench\npolitical experience. I simply\nfail to see this successfully\nhappening with a Labour\nparty with tumultuous divisions\non both Brexit and the Corbyn\nleadership.\nTheresa May can deliver\nthe best outcome of what is a\ndifficult situation. She needs\nthe strong mandate, a 400+\nMP landslide that would offer\nher flexibility to displease\nEurosceptic MPs. This will be\nkey when parliament votes\non the negotiation outcome.\nDelaying the next general\nelection from 2020 originally\nto 2022 guarantees that the\nsurvival instinct that EU\nleaders have exhibited. They\nwant to prevent any future\nexits and set a disturbing EU\nprecedent. They want a weak\nLabour government, one weak\non Brexit, as Britain must not\nthrive outside the EU.\nC o n s e r v a t i v e s\nL a b o u r\nG r e e n\nU K I P\nL i b e r a l D e m o c r a t s\nS N P\nP l a i d C y m r u\nUKIP|PaulNuttall\nU\nKIP, the United\nK i n g d o m\nIndependence\nParty, to give it its\nfull name, has for\nthe last decade\nor so been essentially Nigel\nFarage and friends. He was\nthe leader that led the party to\nthe fulfilment of their primary\ngoal, for the UK to leave\nthe European Union, before\n(eventually) handing over\nthe reins of the party to Paul\nNuttall. The manifesto this time\naround focusses on making\nsure the government, whoever\nthat may be, is pressured into\na full and swift cutting of ties\nwith Brussels.\nThis comes in the form of\nleaving as soon as possible\n(2019), paying none of the\n\u2018divorce bill\u2019 from the EU (for\nour \u201cshare of the financing of\nall the obligations undertaken\nwhile it was a member\u201d), and\nquitting pretty much all of the\nEU initiatives and unions (the\njurisdiction of the European\nCourt of Justice, the EU single\nmarket, and customs union).\nOh, they also want \u201cfull\nmaritime sovereignty\u201d too.\nRule Britannia, Britannia rules\nthe waves, and all that.\nMigration, or lack thereof,\nis also a pillar of UKIP policy\nand they pledge to cut net\nmigration to zero i.e. one\nin, one out. This is in tandem\nwith unskilled and low-skilled\nmigrant labour being banned\nfor five years, with skilled\nworkers and students needing\nvisas to work/study in the\nUK. There is also a pledge to\nrestore university maintenance\ngrants but also one to end\nstudent loans for EU nationals\nafter Brexit.\nForeign aid is also to be\nslashed and funnelled into the\nstruggling NHS, contributing\nto an extra \u00a311bn for NHS\nand social care combined.\nHeadlines have also\nbeen drawn to their policy\nsurrounding the ban on\nwearing a burqa or niqab in\npublic. As an addendum to\ntheir views surrounding the\nbarrier to communication and\nthe risk to security UKIP feel\nthe garments pose, they are\nalso concerned at the lack of\nVitamin D that wearers may\nbe getting from decreased\nexposure to sunlight. The\nburqa and niqab masks\npeople\u2019s faces, much like the\nVitamin D excuse masks UKIP\u2019s\ntrue intentions. No news yet on\nwhether their sympathies also\nextend to those of us stuck in\nthe library revising all day.\nAnd just when you think we\u2019d\nhad enough of them, UKIP\nalso pledge to hold a public\nreferendum on something\n(literally anything) every two\nyears based on public opinion.\nFun Fact: The manifesto namedrops U2 frontman, Bono. Prediction: Their vote share will tumble and they will likely have no MPs. Poor Paul.\nSNP|NicolaSturgeon\nT\nhe Scottish National\nParty (SNP) rose to\nprominence in 2015\nafter they swept 56\nout of the 59 seats in\nScotland, solidifying\nthemselves as the voice of\nScotland in Westminster.\nChunks of SNP policy, as\nis the same with Plaid Cymru,\nfocusses on topics which are\n\u2018devolved\u2019 and aren\u2019t voted on\nin Westminster. Despite that,\nthe manifesto does actually\nlay out how the SNP would\nvote in some cases (essentially\nthey\u2019d vote as they would if the\nmatter involved Scotland).\nThe keystone of SNP policy\nhas been the fight for Scottish\nIndependence, a case\nwhich they fought for in the\nindependence referendum\n(#indyref) back in 2014. After\nBrexit they now want a second\nreferendum (#indyref2).\nSturgeon and the SNP were\noriginally planning to have\nthis referendum before Spring\n2019 but it\u2019s now been pushed\nto sometime after the final\nBrexit negotiations go through.\nWith regards to Brexit, the\nSNP want to protect Scotland\u2019s\nplace in the EU single market\nas well as actually getting\nthe Scottish Government\n(themselves) a place at the\nBrexit negotiations.\nSimilar policies to Labour\npop up here and there in the\nmanifesto, including a \u00a310\nminimum wage, no increase in\nNational Insurance/VAT, and\ntriple lock on pensions.\nAnother point of note is\nthat it\u2019s the deputy leader,\nAngus Robertson, who\nwould represent the party in\nWestminster. This is because\nSturgeon is the Scottish\nFirst Minister and that job\ncomes with its own Georgian\ntownhouse. I\u2019d probably send\nmy deputy to Westminster too.\nFun Fact: Scotland or Scottish is mentioned 515 times in the manifesto. Predicted Seats: Scotland\u2019s largest party by far, they\u2019ll probably lose a seat or two.\nPlaidCymru|LeanneWood\nA\ngain, due to\nd evo l u t i o n,\nPlaid isn\u2019t\nreally up\nagainst the\nbulk of the\nmain party policies. The\ndevolved Party manifestos\nare so removed from the\n\u2018Westminster\u2019 policies that\nthe Llafur Cymru (Welsh\nLabour) manifesto doesn\u2019t\nonce mention Jeremy Corbyn.\nSome parts of Welsh life\nare inevitably governed by\nWestminster but the Walesspecific policies can make all\nthe difference when casting\nyour vote.\nWales is set to be one of\nthe areas hardest hit by the\nloss of EU money, and one of\nPlaid\u2019s key policies is ensuring\nthat Westminster promise to\nreplace every penny. Plaid are\nalso promising to guarantee\nrights for all Europeans\ncurrently in Wales, and aim\nto secure a strong Brexit deal\nfor Welsh agriculture and\nindustry.\n\u00a37.5 bn would also go\ntowards infrastructure\ninvestments in hospitals,\nrailways, schools, roads,\nand housing, as well as vast\ninvestments in health, social\ncare, and policing. They would\nintroduce an independently\nverified living wage and\nliving pension, and invest\nsignificantly in education at all\nstages, including increasing\nthe availability of Welsh\nlanguage education.\nThe manifesto promises a\nnew Welsh legal jurisdiction\nand human rights charter.\nThey pledge investments in\nrenewables and a new Climate\nChange Act, and promise\nto fight to scrap Trident and\noppose military action without\nUN and parliamentary\napproval. Their key pledge\nis to continue to fight for an\nindependent Wales, elevated\nfrom \u201ca minor English region\u201d\nas it currently stands. They\npromise further powers for\nthe Welsh Assembly, including\nhaving an independent\ncommission examine the\ndistribution of funding across\nthe UK to ensure Wales gets\nthe best deal. They would\nhave the Welsh Assembly\ntake a more prominent role in\nnational decisions that have\nimplications within Wales.\nFun Fact: Dydw i ddim yn siarad Cymraeg. Prediction: Around the same as last time, three, maybe four MPs.\nG E 2 0 1 7\n\n"

It\u2019s just a case of how big\nthe Tory majority is. My bet is on\nover 9,000.\nHere\u2019s the truth about the parties\nfighting for your vote:\nLabour: Deluded commie scum\nLib Dems: Ha ha we screwed\nthem over in Coalition\nUKIP: We gave you Brexit so\nvote Tory\nSNP: You had your referendum\nso shut up\nGreens: Flower people\nTories: For rich people (you)\nAs a loyal Tory, I begin my day\nchanting \u201cStrong and Stable\u201d multiple times until my flatmates tell me\nto shut up. May is a great leader!\nIt\u2019s no matter that unlike Thatcher,\nshe is for turning, she\u2019s completely\nuncharismatic, is stiff and uninspiring and runs away from a debate.\nWe called this election despite\nMay\u2019s constant denials, expecting\nthis to be in the bag. Instead, we\nmessed up royally and Labour may\nactually win this. How could this\nhappen when we control all the\nnewspapers and TV news? Unacceptable! That is why I am here to\ncanvass for your vote with bland,\nboring sound-bites.\nThe Conservatives are the party\nfor working people. We say that\nwith a straight face while we cut\nyour healthcare, your education,\nyour lunch, your benefits, your\njobs. We will also cut your hair,\nyour nails, your arms, your nose,\nyour ears etc. We will alienate the\nelderly by cutting pensions and\nimposing a dementia tax. Also,\nlet\u2019s ignore young people who are\nthe future of this country.\nWe will help you by focusing our\nattention on legalising fox hunting\nwhile nurses and teachers use food\nbanks. Pooh pooh it\u2019s their fault\nfor being poor. They didn\u2019t work\nhard enough, unlike me who was\nborn into wealth, went to a private\nschool and used all my papa\u2019s\nconnections to get my job.\nThe Conservatives will grow\nthe economy. Only rich, well\nconnected people will benefit\nbut the wealth will trickle down,\neventually, somehow. We will give\nyou the right deal for Brexit, under\na Prime Minister who campaigned\nagainst it in a referendum we\nbadly miscalculated. In order to\ndistract the masses we will then just\nblame everything on immigrants,\nwhich we have failed to limit.\nRemember, the Conservative\nparty is for you, unless you\u2019re\npoor, homeless, disabled, young,\nin university, not in university,\nworking class, middle class, work-ing, unemployed, old or dead. In\nwhich case, fuck you, you useless\ndeadbeat.\nS\no Mrs Thatcher 2.0 is\nfinally quaking in her\nboots. Her 20 point\nlead in the polls has\nshrunk fast and now\nwe are on the cusp\nof a new dawn. No more will\nthe people accept a corporatist,\naristocratic, unequal society built\nby and for the rich. No to cuts in\nthe NHS, no to tax cuts for faceless\ncorporations, no to the lunch\nsnatcher!\nIf you are still undecided here\u2019s a\nrundown of all the parties:\nUKIP: Fascists, racists, Islamophobes, everything-phobe\nTories: Evil heartless scum\nLib Dems: Oh you poor thing\nSNP: Please don\u2019t vote for them,\nplease\nGreens: Who?\nLabour: The saviour of mankind\nSeriously, Corbyn is like your\ngrandfather whom you can drink\nwith at the pub while everyone\naround him starts moving away.\nMay is a vampire who feeds off\nthe blood of the miserable. Like\nreally, how has no one figured that\none out yet?\nLabour has a plan for you. We\u2019ll\nthrow money at everything, at the\nNHS, at schools, at old people, at\nbabies\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter that we\ncan\u2019t pay for it, and the rich people\nwill bugger off when the taxes go\nup, we\u2019ll just print money because\nwe don\u2019t know basic economics.\nAfter all, John McDonnell has\npromised solidarity with Stalinists,\nand they\u2019re paragons of economic\ngenius. We\u2019ll keep you safe by\nabolishing MI5 and the army,\nwhile we throw billions at Trident\nand then never use it. What could\ngo wrong when we\u2019re friends with\nthe IRA and Hamas?\nIt doesn\u2019t matter than 80%\nof Labour MPs oppose Corbyn\nand that he has never had any\nleadership experience. Put aside\nyour horror at the thought of Diane\nAbbott as Home Secretary (and\nyou thought Boris was bad). The\nHouse of Commons won\u2019t be a\nmess and we will negotiate any\nBrexit deal even if we don\u2019t know\nwhat we\u2019re doing and those EU\ntwats rip us off. After all, a bad\ndeal is better than no deal.\nUnder Comrade Corbyn, we\nwill unleash a new society. This is\nonly phase one.

In this\nversion, the setting is moved\nto Berlin in 1981, before\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall.\nThe titular character, Frank\nWoyzeck, is a young British\nsoldier stationed in Berlin,\nstruggling to provide a home\nfor his girlfriend, Marie, and\ntheir child. As they aren\u2019t\nmarried they cannot live in\nthe barracks, but Woyzeck\u2019s\nmeagre salary can barely\nafford their tiny apartment.\nDesperate for money,\nWoyzeck agrees to take part\nin a mysterious clinical trial\nof an unknown drug. Here\nbegins his descent from a\nstruggling young man into\ndesperation, delusion and,\neventually, insanity.\nThe story retains many\nof the elements of B\u00fcchner\u2019s original \u2013 Woyzeck is\nstruggling with poverty and\ninsecurity, and is manipulated by people in power: his\nsleazy army captain engages\nhim in menial tasks, whilst the\nmysterious doctor engages\nhim in the trial without any\ninformation. However, this\nadaptation heaps additional\ntrauma into Woyzeck\u2019s past.\nWe are told he was abandoned by his mother, later\nretrieved from the orphanage\nWoyzeck at the\nOld Vic | Saving\nan overblown\nadaptation\nVaishnavi Gnanananthan\nBoyega impresses in an\notherwise lacklustre adaptation\nof George B\u00fcchner's unfinished\nplay.\nWoyzeck is on at the Old Vic until June 24th\n.\nTickets from \u00a312\nJohn Boyega and Sarah Greene in Woyzeck\n\\\\ Manual Harlan\nonly to be forced to watch\nhis mother have sex with\na customer. He has been\nplagued by rejection from\npotential foster parents and\ndeemed to be \u2018difficult\u2019. The\nplay also makes allusions to\nan \u2018episode\u2019 during a previous assignment in Belfast,\nthat leads to Woyzeck being\nshunned by many of the other\nsoldiers. These additions are\nsomewhat excessive. B\u00fcchner\nintended the original to depict\nthe struggles of the working\nclass \u2013 Woyzeck\u2019s troubles\nare results of financial pressure and abuse by those in\npower. However, the multiple\ntragedies almost remove this\nmessage. This Woyzeck is so\ntroubled that what happens to\nhim seems almost inevitable.\nThe change in setting to\n1980s Berlin adds little to\nthe story. There are some\nattempts to connect the\ndivided Berlin to what is happening to Woyzeck. However,\nthese references carry no\nweight and the attempt itself\nseems disingenuous. This is a\nreal pity as everything else\nreally comes together. The\nstaging is immersive, with\nthe use of shifting walls that\nadd depth to every scene.\nMoments where Woyzeck\nrips into the walls to reveal\nblood and flesh are powerful,\nespecially as those walls\nremain on stage, forming an\nincreasingly bloodstained\nbackdrop.\nThe real strength of this\nadaptation is the cast. John\nBoyega (of Star Wars fame)\nis truly compelling as the\ntitular Woyzeck. He captures\na delicate vulnerability that\nmakes Woyzeck an endearing character and ensures the\naudience is undoubtedly on\nhis side. As Woyzeck begins\nto fall apart, Boyega keeps\nthe audience invested in his\nemotional journey and, in the\nfinal scenes, brings an almost\nsurreal intensity to the role\nas Woyzeck\u2019s life collapses\naround him. There are strong\nperformances from the rest\nof the main cast, including\nSarah Greene as Marie and\nBen Batt as a fellow soldier,\nalthough it\u2019s clear that\nBoyega is the star of the show.\nAll in all, the strong production and cast are somewhat\nlet down by the story.\nWoyzeck contains so many\ncompelling elements, but\nthe overly tragic backstories\npull the audience out of the\nnarrative.\n\\\\ The story\nretains many\nof the elements\nof B\u00fcchner\u2019s\noriginal- Woyzeck\nis struggling with\npoverty and\ninsecurity, and is\nmanipulated by\npeople in power\\\\\n\\\\ John Boyega (of\nStar Wars fame)\nis truly compelling\nas the titular\nWoyzeck and\ncaptures a delicate\nvulnerability that\nmakes Woyzeck an\nendearing character\nand ensures\nthe audience is\nundoubtedly on his\nside \\\\\n\\\\ There are some\nattempts to connect\nthe divided Berlin to\nwhat is happening\nto Woyzeck,\nhowever, these\nreferences carry\nno weight and the\nattempt itself seems\ndisingenuous \\\\\n\n"

All EU nationals\nliving in Britain will have their\nexisting rights guaranteed with\nthe hope that the EU will provide the same for all 1.2 million\nUK citizens living in Europe.\nBut what about students? In\n2015, Ed Miliband vowed to\nreduce tuition fees to \u00a36,000\na year. This time Labour have\ngone further and will abolish\ntuition fees altogether (includ-ing those who start university\nthis autumn) and reintroduce maintenance grants.\nAnother welcome move is the\nexclusion of students from\nimmigration numbers (which\nthe Lib Dems promise too)\nand to ensure Britain remains\npart of the Erasmus student\nexchange scheme after it\nleaves the European Union.\nCorbyn and Labour have\nalso found an unlikely ally\nin the form of the UK Grime\nscene with #grime4corbyn\nbeing used by some of the\nUK\u2019s biggest and best MCs\nto show their support. If\nnothing else, Jeremy\u2019s got a\nnew career to fall back on if\nit goes awry on June 8th. A\nJme/JC collaboration has got\nMercury Music prize written\nall over it.\nFun Fact: Largest manifesto, I know because Diane Abbott told me. Prediction: Second largest party, possibly enough to form a Lab/Lib/everyone else coalition.\nLiberalDemocrats|TimFarron\nT\nhe Liberal\nDemocrats know\nthere is a less than\nsmall chance of them\nbecoming the largest\nparty, and are\ncampaigning instead to\nbecome the main opposition\nparty. Their key manifesto\npledges revolve around them\nholding the Conservatives to\naccount on issues such as the\nNHS, education, and most\nprominently, the EU.\nThe Lib Dems have pledged\nto have a second referendum,\nthis time not on whether to\nleave the EU or not, but on the\ndeal that the government has\ngot at the end of it all. With\nregards to EU negotiation,\nthe Lib Dems are fighting to\nretain membership of the\nsingle market and the customs\nunion and want the rights of\nEU citizens in the UK to be\nmaintained (naturally with the\nconverse happening too).\nEconomic policy wise, a \u20181p\nin the pound\u2019 on income tax\nwill raise \u00a36bn for NHS and\nsocial care services. The IFS\npredict that this rise in income\ntax would bring in more money\nthan Labour plans, and in a\nmore forecastable manner,\nbut would affect the top half\nof households rather than the\ntop 2% that Labour would\ntarget. This NHS spending will\nalso accompany a \u00a3100bn\npackage of additional\ninfrastructure investment\non various\np r o j e c t s ,\n(300,000 more\nhomes, \u00a37bn\ninto education,\n\u00a3300m to\np o l i c i n g )\nalong with\nchampioning\nboth the \u2018Northern\nPowerhouse\u2019 and \u2018Midlands\nEngine\u2019 (yes, the latter is now\na real thing too).\nAnother stalwart of Lib Dem\npolicy, and one which features\nagain this time round, is the\nlegalisation of Cannabis. The\nparty want to bring in a legal\nmarket for the currently Class\nB drug, cutting\ndown the load\non police forces\nas well as\nincreasing the\ntax revenue (as\nseen in some\nUS states).\nReinsta ting\nuniversity maintenance grants\nfor the poorest students, as\nwell as bringing back student\nnurse bursaries, is also in the\nmanifesto but they\u2019ve steered\nwell clear of any promises\non reducing tuition fees. WE\nHAVEN\u2019T FORGOTTEN,\nNICK.\nAside from policies, there\u2019s\nalsotheirpledgetorefrainfrom\nforming a coalition with any\nother party. This is something\nthat caused them to lose great\nswathes of their 2010 voters\nafter they compromised some\nof their key policies while in\npower with the Tories from\n2010 to 2015. Whether\nleader, Tim Farron U-turns on\nthis in order to get some of his\nkey manifesto points enacted,\nremains to be seen.\nFun Fact: Tim Farron is up against \u2018Mr Fish Finger\u2019 in his constituency. Seriously. Prediction: Around the same as last time, 10 MPs-ish.\nGreens |CarolineLucas&JonathanBartley\nT\nhe Green Party\nare the party that\nare pushing the\nmost towards a\nutopian society\nwith their manifesto,\nchampioning animal rights,\nenvironmentalism, and a\nunited Europe (in the form of\nthe EU).\nThe Greens, similar to the\nLib Dems, want a second\nreferendum on the terms of the\nBrexit deal with the EU and\nanother final choice of staying\nin the union (we might actually\nhave to leave and rejoin, it\u2019s\nall a bit unclear as we\u2019re the\nfirst).\nOne big shakeup would be\nenacting a four-day working\nweek, a policy which the\nmanifesto tackles in half a\nbullet point. All I want to know\nis what day they\u2019re actually\ngoing to turn into a weekend,\nFridays currently feel more\nlike weekends but everyone\nloves a good Bank Holiday\nMonday. It\u2019s a toughie. Other\nchanges to the working world\ninclude the banning of zero-hours contracts and steps\ntowards a universal basic\nincome as well as a minimum\nwage of \u00a310 by 2020.\nStudents may be glad to hear\nof their proposed tuition fees\nscrapping, and fully funded\nstudent grants, bold promises\nbut ones which you shouldn\u2019t\nbank on. Students looking for\nwork in the oil/gas/nuclear\nenergy sectors will be less\nhappy though, as the Greens\naim to replace these entirely\nwith renewables.\nThe environment is at the\nheart of the agenda too, with\na keystone of it all being an\n\u2018Environmental Protection Act\u2019\nto restore and safeguard the\nenvironment. Although this is\na bit vague in the manifesto,\nthere are plenty of policies\nwhich detail things from\ncancelling airport expansions\nto increasing protections on\nenvironmental zones (Green\nBelts, National Parks etc.).\nIn complete opposition to\nUKIP (as most of their policies\nare) is the increase of the\noverseas aid budget from\n0.7% to 1% of the GDP.\nAll in all the Greens face an\nuphill struggle to be a viable\nforce in Westminster as the\ncurrent voting system doesn\u2019t\nwork in their favour at all. They\nonly gained one MP in 2015\n(one of the two co-leaders of\nthe Party, Caroline Lucas) and\nlikely won\u2019t gain a whole lot\nmore.\nCriticism has been drawn\nover the lack of concrete\nfigures in the manifesto but\nthis may be due to the brief\nplanning period that the snap\nelection has caused. Imagine\nyou only had three hours to\ncomplete your lab report,\nyou\u2019d be a bit hazy on all the\nfigures too. And remember,\nas their arch nemesis UKIP\nshowed, you don\u2019t actually\nneed MPs to start a revolution,\nyou just need public support.\nFun Fact: Shortest of the manifestos (26 pages). Very environmentally friendly. Prediction: Likely just the one MP, the flaw of FPTP.\nC o n s e r v a t i v e s\nL a b o u r\nG r e e n\nU K I P\nL i b e r a l D e m o c r a t s\nS N P\nP l a i d C y m r u\n\\\\ Another stalwart\nof Lib Dem policy is\nthe legalisation of\nCannabis \\\\\nG E 2 0 1 7\nManifestobreakdowns|Thepolicyheadlines\nThe following pages break down the main party manifestos and summarise a few\nkey policies. This is by no means a full and in-depth analysis of each party. Mainly\nbecause the manifestos are long and complex, and it\u2019s exam season. [Insert tinfoil\nhat theory that the timing of the election coincides with the time when young voters\nare away from their constituencies/too busy to fully engage]\nThese should be brief guides, and the manifestos themselves should be consulted\nbefore you vote (or at least the impartial and bullet-pointed BBC synopses of them).\nAnother good resource is uk.isidewith.com, a website which asks your opinion on\npolicy points and, within a degree of error, gives you an idea of who best fits your\nviews. Aside from all this, the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) is an impartial body\nwho have looked into the main party manifestos and given their verdict of the economics behind it all, well worth a look too. Also visit yourvotematters.co.uk to find\nyour local candidates as well as theyworkforyou.com to see how the incumbent\nhas performed.\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t let felix be your sole source of political information (or\nany other publication/party website for that matter), you need to be fully informed\nwhen you cast your vote (or spoil your ballot) on June 8th\n.\nConservatives |TheresaMay\nT\nhe Conservative\nparty started this\nelection campaign\nwith the sole intent\nto claim a larger\nmajority and\nstrengthen their position when\nit came to negotiating the\nfuture of Britain after Brexit.\nWhen the snap election was\ncalled by Theresa May back\nin April it seemed a full-blown conclusion that a large\nConservative majority was\ninevitable, but that lead in\nthe polls (of around 24%) has\nbegun to slide in recent weeks.\nJust how confident was May\nof winning a majority? Well\nshe announced her support\nfor the return of fox hunting\nlast month, a policy that 78%\nof the public disagreed with.\nWhatever your feelings on the\nmatter, to back a policy that\nless than a fifth of the public\nagree with was a ballsy move.\nThe issue of the moment,\nBrexit, is one which the Conservatives aim to facilitate as\nsmoothly as possible, leading to a \u201cstrong\nand stable\neconomy\u201d. The\nmanifesto sets\nout plans to\nleave the single\nmarket and the\ncustoms union\nwith the EU,\nwhilst seeking a\n\u201cdeep and special relationship\u201d\nwith it. It almost sounds roman-tic. Almost.\nWith this exit from EU, the UK\nwill be able to pursue trade\ndeals more openly with the\nwider world. May believes that\nthis is now the way forward,\ndespite backing the Remain\ncampaign.\nThe NHS is a non-Brexit\ntopic that is discussed by all\nparties, with the Conservatives\npledging \u00a38bn\nextra fund-ing. The Tories\nhave chosen\nto tackle the\nrising costs of\nsocial care by\ni n t rod uc i ng\na plan which\nalters how\nmuch people\npay towards\ntheir own care. These plans\nwill raise the current threshold\nat which people start paying,\nfrom \u00a323,250 to \u00a3100,000,\nbut the exemptions that meant\n(usually) houses wouldn\u2019t count\nas assets could be scrapped.\nThese rules will also now apply\nif you get care in your home\n(for illnesses such as dementia,\nhence why it\u2019s been nicknamed\nthe \u2018dementia tax\u2019). This means\nmore people could be forced\nto sell off their home to pay\nfor their care, albeit not while\nthey\u2019re living. These care costs\nseemingly had no limit in the\nmanifesto, until May U-turned\nand said that there would be a\ncap on lifetime care costs. No\nconcrete figure has yet to be\nput on that limit though.\nThe economy also features\nheavily in the manifesto, with\nthe ever recurring pledge to\n\u2018balance the books\u2019 (make\nsure government spending =\ngovernment revenue) which\nwill now not occur until 2025.\nPlans to raise personal tax\nallowances to \u00a312,500 and\ncut corporation taxes to 17%\nwill be maintained from the last\ngeneral election. Basically \u2018we\npromised to do this by 2020\nand we\u2019ll keep going towards\nthat\u2019. Increases in VAT have\nalso been ruled out, fantastic\nnews, as I can barely work out\n20% of prices as it is, let alone\nsome other decimal value.\nIf you\u2019re hoping to see May\ndiscuss these policies directly\nwith the other party leaders\nthen you\u2019ll be sadly disap-pointed, she chose to \u2018meet\nvoters\u2019 directly up and down\nthe country rather than debate\nwith the other leaders on TV.\nAmber Rudd, current home\nsecretary, did however take\nher place in the BBC debate\non Wednesday.\nFun Fact: In the manifesto, \u2018strong\u2019 appears 86 times and \u2018stable\u2019 a mere 20 times. Prediction: Around enough MPs to form a majority, could go either way though.\nLabour|JeremyCorbyn\nA\nt the start of\nthe General\nE l e c t i o n\nc a m p a i g n\nwith 24 points\nb e t w e e n\nthe two major parties in the\npolls, a massive Conservative\nlandslide on the 8th\nof June\nlooked all but inevitable. It was\nmeant to be an election about\nleadership of the \u201cstrong and\nstable\u201d kind, not one fought\non policy. But the popularity\nof Labour\u2019s manifesto and\nkey promises has surprised\nmany. They have offered a\nmanifesto, which while large\nswathes of the press might\nlabel as extreme, is in tune\nwith a large proportion of the\npopulation.\nThe slogan \u201cfor the many, not\nthe few\u201d is at the core of many\nof the document\u2019s proposals.\nThe party have promised to\nincrease income tax for the top\n5% of earners, or those earning over \u00a380,000, with new a\nnew 45p rate as well as a 50p\ntax rate on all money earned\nover \u00a3123,000. An arguably\nmore extreme measure is the\nincrease of corporation tax\nfrom 19% to 26% \u2013 Labour say\nthat this will raise up to \u00a319.4\nbillion a year \u2013 but others warn\nthat companies will move business away from the UK as a\nresult (especially in an uncertain post-Brexit climate).\nThe most transformative\nmeasures in the manifesto look\nat bringing back many private\nservices into public ownership.\nRailways will be run by the\ngovernment when franchises\nexpire (at a cost of nothing to\nthe taxpayer) and a fare cap\nwill be introduced. The manifesto also includes the promise\nof at least one publicly-owned\nenergy company in every\nregion of the UK, a return to\npublic control of the national\ngrid, and a ban on fracking.\nBritain\u2019s unions will be very\nhappy with Labour\u2019s manifesto\nas it includes the creation of a\nMinistry of Labour to enforce\nworkers rights as well as the\nrepeal of the Trade Union Act.\nUnpaid internships and zero-hours contracts will be banned.\nAnd workers will finally be\npaid a Living Wage with the\nMinimum Wage rising to at\nleast \u00a310 by 2020.\nOn Brexit, the manifesto\noutlines what the party hopes\nto achieve in talks with the\nEU. Single market and customs union benefits are to be\nretained as well as membership\nof many R&D groups (which\n\\\\ Plans to raise\npersonal tax\nallowances to\n\u00a312,500 will be\nmaintained \\\\\n\n"

    "content": "TheElectionandTheNHS\nS\nince the surprise\nof 7th\nMay 2015,\nthe NHS has fallen\ninto its darkest\ntimes since its\ninception. As a\nmedical student, seeing my\ncolleagues here and across\nthe whole medical profession\nhas, frankly, made becoming\na doctor look the least\nappealing it\u2019s looked since 14\nyear-old me decided it was\nthe route I was going to take.\nAnd I\u2019m not alone in thinking\nthis: since 2014, applications\nfor medical school have been\nin constant decline. The most\nrecentfiguresreleasedshowed\nthat (from UK applicants) the\nnumber of students applying\nin 2016 compared to 2014\nhad fallen roughly 13.5%,\nwith one of our fellow London\nmedical schools, St George\u2019s,\noffering clearing places for\nthe last two years running.\nHowever, it goes beyond\njust the beginning of training.\nThe staffing crisis has only\nbeen exacerbated by the\nConservatives. With the\ninfamous Junior Doctor\ncontract imposition, the\nnumber of Junior Doctors\nchoosing to stay with the NHS\nafter their foundation training\n(the first two years after\ngraduating) fell to record lows\nin 2015 to just 52% (down\nfrom 71.3% just six years ago).\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop with\ndoctors, I don\u2019t have enough\nwords to go into detail, but\na simple \u2018nurses food banks\u2019,\n\u2018nurse\u2019s strike\u2019, \u2018below inflation\npay rise\u2019 (for it\u2019s sixth year\nrunning) in your chosen\ninternet search engine will\ngive you a sense of the gravity\nof this NHS-wide crisis.\nI\u2019ll obviously be prioritising\nthe NHS on June 8th\n, but I\nstrongly urge everyone do the\nsame. The NHS brought you\ninto this world, it\u2019s what\u2019ll see\nyou out, and it will be there\nfor every broken bone, mental\nhealth problem, and ailment,\nno matter how large or small,\nin between. Even without\nthe statistics and endless\nTerrestrial TV documentaries,\nit\u2019s plain to see the NHS is at a\nbreaking point, and you don\u2019t\nneed to dust for fingerprints to\nsee who\u2019s to blame.\nPersonally, I\u2019ll be voting\nLabour. In Hammersmith\nthey\u2019re the only hope we\nhave against a Conservative\ngain (with only a 6.8% swing\nneeded for such an outcome).\nBut while this is the case, what\nI think is best for our NHS is\nstopping the Tories. Thus I\u2019m\ntaking the typical millennial-F a c e b o o k - s p a m m i n g\napproach of promoting\ntactical voting.\nHonestly? I\u2019m not sure who\nwould handle the NHS best\nanymore. The Blair years\nsaw waiting times slashed\nand resource availability\nskyrocket, but also saw A&E\nand maternity services closed\nin around 60 local hospitals.\nThe Lib Dems\u2019 plans look\npromising but we all know\nhow easy they are to bend\non promises. The only thing I\ncan say for sure is as a future\nhealth care professional, me\nvoting Tory is like a turkey\nvoting for Christmas.\nWhoever you are, you will need the NHS at somepoint \\\\ NHS\nfelix\nTHE\nGENERAL ELECTION\nSURVEY\n2017\nCale Tilford\nHOW RESPONDENTS VOTED IN 2015 (%)\nHOW RESPONDENTS INTEND TO VOTE IN 2017 (%)\n140 PARTICIPANTS\nMEAN AGE OF 20.9\n77% IDENTIFIED AS MALE\n21% IDENTIFIED AS FEMALE\n2% IDENTIFIED AS NON-BINARY\n88% UNDERGRAD\nPHYSICS STUDENTS\nWERE MOST\nLIKELY TO\nVOTE LABOUR AT\n88%\nDATA COLLECTED BETWEEN\n12TH\n- 26TH\nOF MAY\nONLY 86 STUDENTS WHO TOOK PART IN THE\nSURVEY WERE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN 2015\nBACK IN 2010, 56%OF RESPONDENTS TO\nA FELIX SURVEY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD\nVOTE FOR FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS\nTODAY JUST 8%OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEY\nWOULD VOTE FOR THE PARTY\nWHEREAS COMPUTING\nSTUDENTS\nWERE MOST\nLIKELY TO VOTE\nCONSERVATIVE AT\n44%\nTURN OVER FOR MORE\nGREAT STATS >>>>>>>\nDan Faehndrich\nC o n s e r v a t i v e s\nL a b o u r\nG r e e n\nU K I P\nL i b e r a l D e m o c r a t s\nS N P\nP l a i d C y m r u\nWhyI\u2019mvotingLabour\nS\noft on security,\ndenying the deficit,\nand incapable\nof addressing\nconcerns over\ni m m i g r a t i o n .\nThese sound like the sort of\naccusations the Conservatives\nlevelled at the last Labour\ngovernment not too long\nago, and yet, after seven\nyears in government, these\nare all areas in which the\nConservative party have\nfailed by their own metrics.\nTo anyone who even vaguely\nfollows politics, the election on\nthe 8th\nof June seems to be a\nforgone conclusion. Of course\nTheresa May will win in a\nlandslide. Of course Labour\nare going to haemorrhage\nseats. But should this really be\nthe case?\nConsider Brexit, currently\nbeing pursued with reckless\nabandonbytheConservatives.\nIt seems they\u2019re keen not only\nto close the door on Europe,\nbut throw away the key. Not\nonly are they threatening\nto withdraw us from the EU\nwithout an agreement, which\ncould be extremely damaging\nto our economy but they\u2019re\npulling us out of European\norganisations we don\u2019t even\nwe champion at Imperial:\nvalues we hold not out of\nsentiment, but because we\nknow fruitful results are borne\nout of cooperation. For all\ntheir lines about left-wingers\nand the economy, here the\nConservatives are clearly\nputting populism ahead of\neconomic credibility.\nConsider that national debt\nis the highest it\u2019s been in fifty\nyears, the NHS is extremely\nvulnerable and underfunded,\nand that doctors (doctors for\nChrist\u2019s sake!) have taken to\nthe streets against Jeremy\nHunt, who nonetheless\nhas retained his position.\nConsider that the Education\nMaintenance Allowance has\nbeen scrapped, fees are set\nto rise indefinitely, that local\ngovernment funding (which\ncovers things like libraries,\nhousing and adult social care)\nhas been slashed. Consider\nthat the party of small\ngovernment and national\nsecurity has passed legislation\nspecifically to invade your\nprivacy and cut tens of\nthousands of police jobs.\nRecall the repeated failures\nto reduce immigration and\ncontrol spending. Non-EU\nmigration alone, which can be\ncontrolledbyUKgovernments,\nexceeded the promised total\namount. They\u2019ve failed to\nkeep their promises regarding\nthe deficit, assuring us it would\nbe eliminated by 2015, then\n2017, then 2020 and now\n2025. Whether you think\nthese promises were sensible\nisn\u2019t important here: they\nwere made, and it is therefore\nentirely fair to criticise the\ngovernment for failing to keep\nthem.\nConsider their own\nmanifesto, which included a\npolicy that would strip you\ndown to your last \u00a3100,000\nof assets after death, an\nextremely regressive form of\ninheritance tax, should you\nrequire care while suffering\nwith a degenerative disease\n(dubbed the \u201cdementia tax\u201d).\nTheresa may have halfheartedly backed down on\nthis \u2013 the first time a party has\nbroken a manifesto pledge\nbefore an election \u2013 but she\u2019s\nmade clear a similar policy\nmight yet survive and don\u2019t\nforget, the Conservatives\nthought this would be a\nsensible idea in the first place.\nLabour have put forward\na more optimistic manifesto.\nUnlike that of the Conservative\nparty, it was fully costed at the\npoint of publication. People\ncan disagree about the\nspecifics, but all the numbers\nare out there. In stark contrast\nwith the Conservatives, Labour\nhave pledged to restore the\nEMA, abolish tuition fees,\nrecruit 10,000 police officers,\ninvest\u00a3250bnininfrastructure,\nrenationalise rail and mail to\nimprove efficiency and lower\nconsumer costs and undertake\nBrexit in a responsible manner\nthat puts the economy first.\nFor this, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s\nparty is being painted as\nradical, but why? None of\nthem are out of step with the\nrest of Europe, and indeed\nmany (abolishing tuition fees,\nrenationalising Royal Mail)\nare merely a restoration\nto the balance that existed\nunder that great socialist\nMargaret Thatcher. On the\neconomic front, the Tories\nand tabloid press tell us that\nthe Labour party cannot be\ntrusted, and indeed they must\nbe on shaky ground if their\nunderlying ideas are only\nendorsed by two recent Nobel\nPrize winners and a diverse\ngroup of other high profile\nacademics (who cares about\nexperts these days, anyway?).\nThose of you worried that,\nfor example, taxes on the\nwealthy might drive them\nabroad should note that the\nConservatives are a) driving\njunior doctors abroad at a\ntime when the NHS is short-staffed and b) pursuing a hard\nBrexit which might be a lot\nmore damaging to business\nthan a few extra pennies of\ntax on the most successful. The\nsmall income tax increases\nsuggested are very much\nin step with our European\nneighbours, and the suggested\ncorporation tax would still be\nlower than that of most major\nEuropean countries and the\nUnited States of America.\nThroughout this campaign,\nthe Conservatives have chosen\nto focus on personality instead\nof policy, pitting the \u201cstrong\nand stable\u201d Theresa May\nagainst Corbyn\u2019s \u201ccoalition of\nchaos,\u201d but the British people,\nand certainly those of you at\nImperial, should be intelligent\nenough to see through that.\nIdeas have to come first\n\u2013 if you don\u2019t believe me,\nask yourself where David\nCameron is right now. Even\nengaging with their argument\nabout leadership reveals their\nweaknesses: a strong leader\nwouldn\u2019t refuse to debate\ntheir opponents, hide from the\npublic at carefully managed\nevents, or abandon any policy\nthat meets the slightest hint of\nresistance.\nTrusting the alternative to\nthe establishment is never\neasy, but ask yourself if, in\nthe face of all the evidence\npresented here, you can\nsupport the Conservative\nparty in good conscience.\nRather than voting for a party\nthat\u2019s hinted it\u2019ll bring back\nfox hunting and doesn\u2019t seem\nto have education, healthcare\nor international cooperation\nhigh on its list of priorities,\nvote to challenge Theresa\nMay\u2019s vision on Brexit.

    "content": "felix\nC U L T U R E\nFriday 2 June 2017 19\nculture.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/culture\nL\nast season, when\nEmma Rice was\nappointed artistic\ndirector, the Globe\nseemed to set a new\ncourse. Her tenure\nwould mean the company\nwould no longer be focused\nsimply on conservation of\nShakespeare but on mutation\nand adaptation of the\nclassic texts for a modern\naudience. Yet, this, only\nher second season, is also\nRice\u2019s swansong \u2013 she will\nbe stepping down in a few\nmonths, and if her adaptation\nof Twelfth Night is any\nindication, she is making it\ncount.\nIn Rice\u2019s production we\u2019re\ntransported to a parallel\n1970s, a world in which\nShakespeare\u2019s verses are cut\nwith disco anthems, glitter,\nbright lights, and enthusiastic\ndancing. Twelfth Night, for all\nits fun is a text shot through\nwith melancholy. These\nsubtler, darker emotions get\nlost in Rice\u2019s production; what\nit lacks in nuance it more\nthan makes up for in sheer\nentertainment. The audience\npacked into benches and\nstanding in front of the stage\nwere buoyed by the dazzle\nand spectacle of the produc-tion, which more than once\nfelt like a raucous panto; able\nto capture wonderment and\njoy in equal measure.\nA lot of things happen in\nTwelfth Night: after a ship-wreck, the twins Viola and\nSebastian are separated; the\nheroine Viola finds herself\nwashed up in Illyria, a far-off\ncountry that Rice imagines\nas a seventies Scotland. In\nIllyria, Viola disguises herself\nas a man, Cesario, placing\nherself in the service of Duke\nOrsino who is trying to win\nthe favour of the wealthy\nCountess Olivia. Viola as\nCesario goes to woo Olivia\non behalf of the Duke but\nfinds that she has become\nthe object of Olivia\u2019s affection whilst she herself has\nfallen in love with the Duke.\nMeanwhile, Olivia\u2019s steward\nMalvolio, is tricked by others\nin Olivia\u2019s household into\nthinking Olivia has fallen in\nlove with him, and proceeds\nto act so inappropriately that\nhe\u2019s carted off to solitary\nconfinement. Things come to\na head when Sebastian, not\ndead after all, also washes up\non Illyria and is mistaken for\nCesario.\nIt can be a challenge for the\ncast to effectively convey to\nan audience who may not all\nbe familiar with the plot. In\nparticular, Olivia\u2019s fool, Feste,\ncan be a tricky character to\ntranslate in most productions.\nHere, he has been transformed into something of a\none-man Greek chorus: Le\nGateau Chocolat, drag act\nextraordinaire, holds court\nonstage, baritone soaring.\nJohn Pfumojena as Sebastian\nand Anita-Joy Uwajeh as\nViola are both assuredly char-ismatic, Uwajeh, who has the\nmeatier role, is particularly\nso. It is however, Katy Owen\nas the uptight steward Malvolio, who steals the show.\nOwen is afforded plenty of\nopportunity to show off her\ncomedic chops, her physical\ncomedy in particular, is pitch\nperfect, teetering always on\nthe edge of the truly ridicu-lous. In the latter scenes when\nMalvolio comes to realise\nthat he has been tricked,\nOwen really shines, letting\nthe veneer of his control and\nself-possession fracture to\nreveal his needy vulnerability.\nOwen chooses to play the\nrole straight, giving no hint\nin the performance that she\nis a woman playing a man.\nTwelfth Night is a story of\nsubversion, and rightly, Emma\nRice has put reinvention of\ninterpretation and diversity of\ncast at the centre of her vision\nfor the play. In many ways,\nthis was the play everyone\nhad been looking forward to\nfrom her, Rice has consistently\npushed at the boundaries\naccepted at the Globe.\nShe\u2019s drawn her fair share\nof criticism for her productions as well as admiration.\nI was offered something of\na window into the former\nlast week when I was seated\nnext to a rather elderly white\ngentleman for the perfor-mance. It was clear from the\noutset, he was not going to\nbe a fan. He sat stony faced\nas the magnificent Le Gateau\nChocolat, resplendent in\ngold, belted out the opening\nsong. Magnanimously, I\ngave him the benefit of the\ndoubt \u2013 drag acts can be\nTwelfth Night at\nthe Globe\nIndira Mallik\nEmma Rice remixes Shakespeare\nwith disco anthems and glittery\nfun.\nTwelfth Night is on until August 5th\nat the Globe Theatre\nTickets from \u00a35\nLe Gateau Chocolat as Feste in Twelfth Night at the\nShakespeare's Globe \\\\ The Shakespeare's Globe\na shock to the uninitiated,\nperhaps he\u2019d warm to the\nperformance. But it was\nalready too late: by the time\nhe\u2019d composed his face into a\nrictus grimace of 'tolerance',\nTony Jayawardena, and then\nin quick succession, Theo St.\nClaire, Kandaka Moore, and\nNandi Bhebhe were on stage\nin their kilts. This simply was\nnot on - he\u2019d come to see\nShakespeare, who were these\nbrown-skinned interlopers?\n\u201cBlack and Scotch?!\u201d he\nmuttered, incredulous, as if\nthe thought that anyone with\nskin darker than the colour\nof weak tea might ever wear\ntartan had never occurred\nto him (clearly, he was not\na fan of chef extraordinaire\nTony Singh). He waited a few\nmore moments, presumably to\ndetermine whether this really\nwas happening in front his\nown eyes, when the cast did\nnot turn any fairer, he gathered up his jacket and left, all\nbefore ten minutes were up.\nThis worked out excellently\nfor me and the reviewer next\nto me, we shuffled into the\nspace he\u2019d vacated, and\nproceeded to enjoy the show,\nview no longer impended by\na pillar.\nNothing quite brings up\nidentity politics in theatre\nlike Shakespeare. Though\noriginally devised as entertainment for the masses,\nthese stories are often seen\nas the preserve of the elite,\nhis fierce progressivism is\nforgotten behind the fug of\noutdated language. Who gets\nto tell these stories, and who\nconsumes them? Rice\u2019s answer\nis that muscular adaptation\nof the text and inclusivity are\nthe best ways to maintain\nthe Shakespearean legacy,\nin her tenure she confronted\nthe Globe\u2019s establishment,\npushed at the accepted\nboundaries in much the\nsame way that Viola\u2019s arrival\nshakes up the puritanical society in Illyria. Not all of Rice\u2019s\nexperimentation has hit the\nmark, but at least she tried,\nand it is a great shame she\nwill no longer be afforded the\nopportunity to explore some\nmore.\n\n"

She is\ncommitted to supporting Theresa May\u2019s strong and stable\nleadership to secure the local\neconomy in the future.\nDe\u2019Ath is focussed on human\nrights, in particular those for\nLGBT+ people and women\nsuffering domestic violence.\nFox is firmly against a hard\nBrexit and has accused Conservatives and Labour alike\nof failing to listen to Remain\nvoters. She has promised to\nfight for liberal values and\nstand up for civil liberties.\nFinally Cashmore owns\na business with an annual\nturnover of \u00a32 million per\nannum, thinks there\u2019s need for\na second EU referendum and\npromises hope, creativity and\npersistence.\nBraine is one of the more\nseemingly sane UKIP can-didates. His website and\ncampaign leaflets offer accusations of a \u201cfake Brexit plot\u201d\nand mentions a \u201cLibLabCon\nsurrender-cartel\u201d... wut? His\npriorities include cutting immi-gration, funding the NHS with\nmoney taken from the Foreign\nAid Budget, and helping immigrants to integrate.\nStudents and locals joined\nfor a chance to grill the keen\npoliticians on matters close to\ntheir heart. Before entering\nthe space, attendees were\ngiven the chance to submit\nquestions to the organisers.\nThe panel was chaired\nby Union President Nas\nAndriopoulos who promised\nhe\u2019d stay apolitical. Opening\nstatements were well received\n(Yes, even Braine\u2019s which\nincluded the characterisa-tion of judeo-christianity as\nmankind\u2019s greatest engine\nfor prosperity, and even Borwick\u2019s who insisted she cared\nabout North Kensington\ndespite it being outside her\nconstituency) and generally\nreflected parties\u2019 general\nviews. As the discussion\nprogressed though the\nmood shifted. The discontent\nand frustration in the room\nbecame palpable as Braine\u2019s\nconsistently inflammatory\nremarks started being met\nwith jeering, Borwick was\nheavily criticised by fellow\npanellists and audience\nmembers alike, and even Fox\ntook a hit when an audience\nmember accused the LibDems\nof betraying \u2018The People\u2019 who\nhad loudly voted Leave.\nGenerally responses\nmirrored party manifestos,\nand demonstrated which\nparties and candidates had\ndone their homework. The\ndiscussion kicked off with\neducation with De\u2019Ath and\nCashmore being proponents\nof tuition fee abolishment.\nOn the other side of the\nspectrum Borwick maintained\nthe system works perfectly\nfine and fairly (though she\nadmitted interest rates could\ndo with some adjustment),\nclaiming that more students\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds have been going to\nuni than ever before (though\nthat might be because there\u2019s\nmore of them). Somewhere\nin the middle Fox didn\u2019t\nexplicitly say what her\nstance on fee scrapping is\nthough she did imply tuition\nfees are a necessary evil,\nand instead LibDems were\ndead-set on doing something\nabout student maintenance\ncosts. Also somewhere in the\nmiddle Braine echoed UKIP\u2019s\ninfamous stance of scrapping\ntuition fees but only for STEM\nsubjects, causing an outburst\nfrom English Literature graduate Cashmore.\nQuestions on education\nfrom the floor were mostly\ncentred around concerns for\nthe funding of STEM. How\nwould parties fund STEM and\nResearch and Development\n(R&D) without international\nstudents or tuition fees?\nThe only serious response\ncame from Labour who have\npledged spending 3% of\nthe GDP on R&D. Braine\u2019s\nresponse was reallocating\nthe Foreign Aid Budget and\nBorwick went on a tangent\ntalking about her visit at\nCERN.\nNext came the NHS and its\nprivatisation. Fox started by\nreinforcing her commitment\nto a universal NHS. She did\nhowever distinguish between\nhardware and clinical ser-vices, claiming she\u2019s open to\nprivatisation of the former.\nBorwick returned to the\nfavoured party message of\nno money, no honey. A strong\neconomy is necessary for\nproper investment in health\nservices. The Conservatives\nhave already provided\n\u00a310 billion to the NHS, she\nclaimed, and would release\nan extra \u00a38 billion over the\nnext parliament (though if\nyou have kept up with analyses of the manifestos, you\nwill be aware that this money\nwill actually come from cuts\nin other sectors). Skirting\naround the controversial\nConservative social care\npolicies, she merely said that\nsocial care and health care\nshould be integrated and\ncare should come first when\nit comes to a growing and\nageing population.\nUKIP promises to put\nanother \u00a36 billion into the\nNHS again from the magical\nForeign Aid Budget. They\u2019ll\nalso bring in some 35,000\nGPs and nurses (though\nit\u2019s unclear if there will be\nany willing takers of these\npositions).\nThe Greens promised even\nmore \u2013 \u00a320 billion \u2013 from\nscrapping Trident (which\nCashmore says is pointless\nand costs \u00a33.6 billion per\nannum) and Financial Transaction taxes.\nFinally, De\u2019Ath attacked the\nTories\u2019 \u201cappalling\u201d record. He\nhighlighted the 24,000 nursing vacancies and criticised\nthe uncosted Conservative\nmanifesto. Borwick returned\nfire, criticising the unsuccessful PFI scheme under the\nLabour government (even\nthough the idea was first\nimplemented by John Major\u2019s\ngovernment). She claimed\nit was easy for the other\ncandidates to make promises\nbut the Conservatives had\npresided over an increase in\ndoctors, operations and care.\nQuestion once again started\ncoming in from the floor, with\naudience members chastising\nthe current government for\nhealth cuts, hospital closures\nand the recent \u2018Dementia tax\u2019\nplans.\nFox started by calling out\nthe irony in the conservatives\nwho have presented non-costed manifestos criticising\nthe costed manifestos of their\nopposition. She acknowledged that current LibDem\nplans would not bring UK\nhealthcare spending in line\nwith the EU average but that\nit was \u201ca step in the right\ndirection\u201d.\nDe\u2019Ath and Cashmore\nalso jumped on the\noffensive criticising the government for health cuts and\nshort-sightedness.\nOn the defence, Borwick\nreturned to the idea of social\ncare, this time mentioning\nthe manifesto promise that\npeople would be left with at\nleast \u00a3100,000 after paying\nfor their social care and made\na vague reference to the\nsuccessful rolling out of pilot\nschemes.\nLast came the issue of Brexit\nwhich was always going to be\nimportant given that 33-40%\nof Imperial students aren\u2019t\nBritish. The question specifically referred to what each\nparty would do to guarantee\nthe rights of EU students.\nBorwick and Braine both\nmaintained that contrary to\n\u201ctabloid drivel\u201d internationals in the UK did not seem\nworried.\nCashmore quickly came to\nthe offence citing the feelings\nof fear and discomfort many\nnon-UK nationals were\nfeeling.\nIn another dig at the Tories,\nDe\u2019Ath proclaimed that\nBorwick had just won the\n\u201cTheresa May award for not\nanswering the question\u201d. His\nanswer was simple: the rights\nof all nationals would be\nguaranteed. Fox also agreed\nthat guaranteeing the rights\nof nationals was the right\nthing to do. She also stressed\nthe importance of making\nordinary internationals feel\nat home, not just the Chelsea\nelite. In response Borwick\nasked \u201cWhy are you saying\nthat all plumbers must be\nEuropeans?\u201d despite nobody\nhaving asked that question.\nAt that point the discussion\nlost focus and quickly moved\non to Environment.\nUnfortunately there were\nonly five minutes left to\ndiscuss environmental policy\nwhich gave candidates a\nthirty second window to air\ntheir green views. Unsurprisingly everyone\u2019s main focus\nwas London\u2019s appalling air\npollution. Notably Borwick\nand Braine did not mention\nclimate change, with the\nUKIP candidate additionally\ngoing into a tangent about a\nGerman diesel conspiracy.\nThat concluded the event\nwhich was surprisingly civil\nand an overall success.\nNow go vote.\nLef Apostolakis\nJoanna Wormald\n&\n\n"

    "content": "21 felixonline.co.uk/millennials millennials.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 2 June 2017\nfelix M I L L E N N I A L S\nSEX\nThe near-peg experience\nThe ultimate feminist sexual act and a culture\u2019s fear and obsession with butt stuff\nI\nwent home last week for\na few days over the bank\nholiday. As always when\nI go home, I opened up\nTinder and began to\nswipe. I mostly use it as\na way to keep track of who\nfrom school is single, but\nsometimes use it to shark on\nhot students and locals.\nI swiped right on a few\npeople before I ran out of\ncandidates (it\u2019s a very small\ntown). Being the very fussy\nTinderer that I am, I only\nhad two matches: Ben* and\nAdam*. Shortly, Adam mes-saged me.\n\u201cWanna peg me?\u201d\nIt was a charming message\nthat really appealed to me.\nSuch a careful message, so\nconsiderate of my profile,\nacknowledging that I was a\nwoman with a brain as well\nas fantastic good looks. I was\nalready enamoured with this\nAdam, but best to play it cool.\nIn my classic girl-on-Tinder\nway, I didn\u2019t reply.\nHaving drinks with my best\nfriend the next evening, I\nshowed her the message.\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou have to do it!\u201d Instead\nof being put off by the forwardness of the message, she\nthought I should be keen.\nSure, I was curious. Pegging\nhas always been something\nthat I\u2019ve wanted to do, but\nfinding a man willing to let\nme peg them has proven\nnearly impossible. Pegging\nwas the only thing that my\nlast boyfriend decreed as\na hard no, an attitude that\nseems to be all too common\namong men that I bang. And\nso here someone was offering\nme the holy grail of sexual\nacts, a fucking black swan of\nan opportunity. The chance\nwas being presented to me to\nget this pegging experience\nunder my belt so that we\ncould all move on, no strings\nattached.\nAnd so I replied.\n\u201cDo you have the\napparatus?\u201d\nHe did. We established\nmore details on the situation.\nHe lived a five minute walk\naway (really, a very small\ntown), wasn\u2019t a local (so\nhopefully the small town thing\nwouldn\u2019t be a problem), and\nwas willing to let me, a total\npegging noob, fuck him in the\narse with a strap-on dildo. I\nmean really, what could go\nwrong?\nWell, it turns out, I could.\nPlagued with one of the\nworst coughs of my adult\nlife, I knew there was no way\nI would be able to pound\nsomeone\u2019s ass without collapsing into a hacking, choking\nmess on the floor. I needed to\nstall a couple of days.\nSo under the pretence of\nwanting to see if he was a\nserial killer, I asked him more\nabout himself. Striking the\nbalance between feigning an\ninterest and really wanting\nnothing more from this man\nthan to, as he so delicately\nphrased it, make him my\nbitch, let me tell you, is chal-lenging. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure\nI got it quite right. Maybe I\nused too many puns. Is there\nsuch a thing as too many\npuns? It wasn\u2019t a complete\nboner-killer, but I can\u2019t say it\ndidn\u2019t put a bit of a dampener\non things.\nRegardless, we agreed\nto meet the next night. The\nevening came around, and\nwith rare warning before\nI have sex, I went to the\neffort to shave my legs and\neverything. I was feeling\nempowered; this was going\nto be the night that I lost my\npegging virginity, and really\nit was going to be a metaphor\nfor my whole life as I finally\ngot to assert my dominance\nover a man.\nAs the time ticked closer,\nhe stopped replying to my\nmessages. What had been\nrapid-fire enthusiastic flirting\nbecame silence, and with our\narranged time impending, he\ntragically unmatched me on\nTinder.\nMy pegging dreams came\ncrashing down around me.\nDisappointment aside \u2013\nwhat struck me most about\nthis experience, beyond the\nfact that poor Adam was\nclearly kink-shaming himself\nfor his desires to be pegged,\nwas that my female friends\nwere so taken by this idea \u2013\nsome went home to discuss\nit with their boyfriends, so\nenthusiastic they were about\nthe idea. What is it about\npegging that strikes the imagination of so many women, yet\nstrikes fear into so many men?\nThere are plenty of men \u2013\nstraight, gay, or anything in\nbetween \u2013 out there who love\nto be pegged. Whether it\u2019s\nthe change in power dynamic\nor the stimulation of the\nprostate, once you get a taste\nof it, you\u2019re bound to go back\nfor more. A new experience\ncan create greater intimacy \u2013\nif you\u2019re already in a sexual\nrelationship \u2013 and switching\nup sexual habits can really\nstimulate the appetite.\nBut for a lot of men,\nwhether it\u2019s internalised\nhomophobia, fear for their\nprecious buttholes, or not\nwanting to relinquish power\nto the weaker sex, it\u2019s a total\nno-go. Pegging is the ultimate\nfeminist sex act: to make a\nman the receptive partner,\nwhether it\u2019s in a submissive or\ndominant sense, in our world\nthat worships the phallus,\nputting on an artificial penis\ninevitably causes a shift in\npower.\nSo women, don\u2019t be afraid\nto ask if you want to take\ncontrol over a man, and men,\nopen up your minds and anal\nsphincters to the idea of being\npegged. It might turn your\nworld upside down.\nP.S. Sorry this is all so het-eronormative but you know\nwhat, this peg-o-phobia is\nreally only a straight person\nproblem, queers have got it\ndown.\n*Names are not changed to\nprotect the privacy of these\nmen.\n\\\\ What struck me\nmost about this\nexperience was that\nmy female friends\nwere so taken by\nthis idea some went\nhome to discuss it\nwith their boyfriends\n\\\\\n\n"

Not entirely sure why, though my therapist has\nhinted that maybe, it could be in part the suspected indecision that some people have suggested plagues me and the\nsubsequent pathological need I perhaps have sometimes felt,\nof keeping as many options as possible open.\nSo yeah, I might be voting. Or not. But if I do, who should I\nvote for?\nBest,\nJustine Mabe (but you can call me Tina. Or Joy. Or Jodie)\nHoney,\nI totally feel ya. I struggle with decision\nmaking as much as the next person. This\nmorning for example I was debating whether\nI was going to have chocolate or banana\nweetabix minis for about an hour. In the end I\njust barged into my housemate\u2019s bedroom and\nberated her for a good quarter of an hour\nfor not making better cereal choices. I mean\nwhere are the Coco Pops, the Crunchy Nut,\nthe selection of exotic muesli?\nNeedless to say that by the time I was done it\nwas lunchtime and I just ended up reheating\nsome leftover Sunday roast and having that\ninstead.\nAnyway you get it, I\u2019m indecisive AF. I\nremember last time I had to vote, at the EU\nreferendum, I spent the day prior on my\nHOROSCOPES\nbedroom floor in foetal position, with my\nthumb in my mouth doing breathing exercises.\nWhen I finally made it to the polling station, I\nspent probably a good 30 minutes staring at\nmy ballot. My palms were so clammy, when I\nfinally made up my mind I had to get another\nballot because my first one was soaked and\nhad basically disintegrated in my hands.\nThe EU referendum however was a tremendously valuable experience that really helped\nme make decisions more confidently and act\na bit more impulsively. Despite me personally\nvoting Remain, the UK still voted Brexit.\nSo go vote and don\u2019t overthink it, \u2018cos if the\nuniverse is dead set on fucking you over there\u2019s\nnothing you can do to prevent it.\nBig luv,\nChris xxxx\n\n"

In addition\nto providing the nuclear\nwarheads for each of the\nVanguard submarines that\nmake up Trident, the AWE\ncontributes significant amounts\nto the coffers of Imperial.\nImperial is one of five British\nuniversities to have a \u2018Strategic\nAlliance\u2019 with the AWE and\nas such is the beneficiary of\na five-year investment. How\nbeneficial is this exactly?\nBetween 2010 and 2012,\nImperial received \u00a37.7million\n\u2014 more than the other four\nuniversities with Strategic\nAlliancescombined,according\nto figures in a report published\nby the Nuclear Information\nService (NIS) and Medact,\na non-profit organisation\naffiliated with International\nPhysicians for the Prevention\nof Nuclear War. A Freedom\nof Information request by\nNouse, the newspaper of the\nUniversity of York, reveals\nexactly how much Imperial\nhas gained from this alliance\nsince that time.\nSince 2012, Imperial has\nreceived \u00a39,358,488 from\nthe AWE \u2014 substantially more\nthan any other university that\nresponded to the FOI request.\nAlmost half of this amount has\ngone to the Institute of Shock\nPhysics (ISP) and the Centre for\nInertial Fusion Studies (CIFS)\nas \u201cresearch expenditure\u201d.\nThere is no mention of any\nwork on nuclear warheads\nin research currently being\ncarried out by the ISP or CIFS.\nSo why invest in the College?\nAlthough Imperial might\nnot be directly involved in\nthe development of nuclear\nweapons, research carried\nout here is still useful for the\nAWE \u2014 specifically that of\nthe Plasma Physics Research\nGroup (members of which are\nalso involved in work by the\nISP). For example, a gas gun\ninstallation jointly funded by\nImperial and the AWE allows\nresearchers to investigate\nthe behaviour of materials\nunder extreme pressures and\ntemperatures \u2014 the same sort\nof conditions that are found\nin the middle of a nuclear\nexplosion. Then there\u2019s the\nwork on hydrodynamics,\nwhich can be used to model\nconditions and behaviour\ninside a nuclear warhead.\nSince the UK is prohibited\nfrom testing nuclear weapons\n(it has been a signatory of\nthe Comprehensive Test Ban\nTreaty since 1996) all of this\nis essential for the AWE to\nbe able to provide safe and\nefficient nuclear deterrents.\nIn addition to spending\non research, the NIS report\nfound that between 2010\nand March 2012, Imperial\nreceived financial aid from the\nAWE for consultancy work,\nPhD scholarships, contracts,\ncourses, publications,\nconferences and staff support.\nAside from this funding,\nthere are also non-pecuniary\nadvantages to be gained on\nboth sides. The partnership\nbetween the ISP and AWE\nprovides a \u201ctwo-way transfer\nof technical expertise and\nequipment\u201d. The AWE\nprovides training for students\nand academics and interacts\nwith ISP collaborators to foster\na \u201cnetwork of knowledge and\ntechnology\u201d. In return, the\nAWE benefits from being able\nto access expertly-trained\nindividuals, being able to\nconduct research in the public\ndomain, and publishing joint\nresearch papers in peer-reviewed journals. It is not\nunreasonable to conclude\nthat the alliance also allows\nthe AWE to scope out\npotential future employees;\nof all the FOI requests made\nby Nouse, Imperial was the\nonly respondent to explicitly\npromote employment\nopportunities at the AWE by\nhosting career events and\ndisplaying relevant marketing\nmaterials.\nAWE priorities are clearly\nfocussed on the continuous\nmaintenance of current\nnuclear warheads and the\ndevelopment of a successor\nsystem. The AWE also\nsupports the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty, though it is not obvious\nwhat form this support takes\nbeyond the tight security\nmeasures in place to prevent\nnon-nuclear states getting\nhold of sensitive information.\nAway from the military sector,\nthe AWE is part of the national\nemergency response when\nnuclear accidents occur in\nthe UK. According to the ISP\nwebpage, working with the\nAWE allows the public to\nenjoy safer manufacturing\nmethods, stronger vehicles\n(both civilian and military\ngrade), better protection\nagainst acts of terrorism and\nnatural disasters, and more\nreliable satellites.\nThe research carried out\nat Imperial in conjunction\nwith the AWE has plenty of\npotential benefits. Work on\nthe effect of explosions on\nhuman tissues could be useful\nin treating blast injuries for\ninstance. There is, however, a\nless cheerful prospect. The NIS\nreport highlights the potential\n\u2018dual use applications\u2019 of\nuniversity research \u2014 i.e.\nthe ability to use the results\nof research for \u201cmilitary\npurposes contributing to the\ndevelopment of weapons\nof mass destruction\u201d. For\nImperial, this could mean\nthe weaponisation of studies\ninvolving wave propagation\nor shock processes. When\ndealing with sensitive areas\nof research, projects are\nreferred to the Research\nEthics Committee, though\nthe NIS report could not find\nclear evidence of how the\nCommittee makes decisions\nas to whether research should\ngo ahead or what guidance it\nprovides for handling sensitive\ntopics.\nThis is by no means the\nfirst time Imperial has\nworked closely with military\norganisations and looking\nat the financials gains to be\nmade, it is unlikely to be the\nlast (Imperial has previously\nworked in association with\nthe Ministry of Defence,\nDepartment of Trade and\nIndustry and QinetiQ,\na multinational defence\ncompany, on guided weapons\ntechnology). If it is to continue\nwith these partnerships and\nalliances, Imperial needs to\nbe more transparent about\nwhere its funding is directed\nand what impact its research\nmay have. When approached\nby felix on the subject of\nResearch and Consultancy an\nImperial spokesperson said\n\u201cthat is subject to a security\nclassification above Official\nSensitive [and] is not permitted\nto be undertaken by College\nstaff on any College campus.\n\u201cRelevant Imperial\nDepartments flag employment\nopportunities at AWE to\nstudents as part of the\nCollege\u2019s efforts to promote a\nbroad range of career\npaths\u201c\nAWE funds everything from trident to blast injury research \\\\ Defence Images\n\\\\ Since 2012\nImperial has received\n\u00a39,36 m from the\nAWE, substantially\nmore than any other\nuniversity \\\\\n\n"

    "content": "UKIP, the right wing\nmainstream party, are present\nin the fray as more of an\nideology than an actual force\nin Westminster, with their\n12.7% of votes eventually\nleaving them with no MPs.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t\nimportant though; they ran on\na platform to get out of the\nEU in 2015 and because they\ngot so many votes, they were\nable to force David Cameron\ninto holding a referendum\n(because Dave was scared\nof losing some of his MPs to\nUKIP). Long story short, they\naccomplished one of their\nmain policies, and brought\nabout a massive change to the\nUK, while having fewer MPs\nthan the Lib Dems. Currently\nthey\u2019re led by Paul Nuttall\nbut Nigel Farage, their ale-drinking, cigarette-smoking,\nEU-hating figurehead is never\ntoo far from the picture.\nThis is because at the end of\nthe day you are voting for a\nlocal representative, albeit\none who\u2019ll be somewhat tied\nto a national agenda, and\nthey may have particular\npolicies or beliefs that either\nalign or clash with your own\nviews.\nAnd what\u2019s the likely\noutcome?\nHonestly, it\u2019s getting less and\nless clear by the minute. When\nthe election was called by May\nin April, some polls had her as\nfar ahead as 24% over Labour\nbut as May (the month) went\npast, May (the Prime Minister)\nand the Conservatives had\ntheir lead cut (despite local\nelection losses for Labour) and\nnow June may be a disaster\nfor May (the Prime Minister).\nThis has been largely in part\ndue to a surge from Labour\nrather than a demise for\nthe Tories \u2013 although May\u2019s\n\u2018U-turn\u2019 on social care and\nhow it would be funded didn\u2019t\nhelp them. Local elections\nhave also thrown an extra\nindication of the mood of the\ncountry into the mix, with them\noccurring just a month before\nthe general election, not\nhalfway through a parliament\nlike normal.\nLocal-level governance is\nvery different to the roles that\nMPs have and often votes\nare cast with local issues\nin mind, but general trends\nare probably not too far\noff the pace. Essentially the\nConservatives did well, Lib\nDems did okay, Labour did\npoorly (although this is still\na moving picture), and UKIP\nwere annihilated (this doesn\u2019t\ndo their losses justice).\nAny hopes for a Labour\nwin on June 8th\nlooked to\nbe further diminished, as a\nparty that was going to make\na surge would most likely\nhave made gains rather than\nlosses like they did. However,\nturnout is always lower for\nthese local elections and the\ndemographic of who votes is\ndifferent (not all parts of the\ncountry vote too).\nAs of going to press though,\nthe Conservative party will\nlikely be the largest party but\nwon\u2019t have gained the massive\nmajority that they were hoping\nto achieve. This all depends on\nhow good an indication the\nlocal elections were, whether\nthe current Labour surge in\npopularity continues, and\nwhether the \u2018shy Tory effect\u2019\ncomes into play. And besides,\nif we\u2019ve learnt anything\nrecently, the polls are always\nwrong anyway.\nTurn to the end of the pull-out\nto see how Imperial students\nare planning to vote in our\nreasonably scientific poll.\nWhat to look out for on\nJune 8th\nVoting opens at 7am\non Thursday June 8th\nand\ncontinues until 10pm the\nsame day, but the general\nrule of thumb is that if you\u2019re\nin the queue by 10pm you\u2019ll\nbe eligible to vote (don\u2019t use\nme as your lawyer in court\nthough). During the day\nthere\u2019ll actually be a weird lull\nin the election HYPE as once\nthe polls are open, all the\nnews can report is that \u201cvoting\nis underway\u201d as they aren\u2019t\nallowed to influence voting\none bit.\nAs soon as the clock strikes\n10pm then all hell breaks loose\nas the \u2018Exit polls\u2019 are released.\nThese are opinion polls\nconducted as people leave the\nvoting booths and are roughly\na representation of the results\nahead. As the voting closes\nhis retirement to chair the\nBBC\u2019s coverage. Be prepared\nfor his sleep-deprived sass\nwhen spin doctors try and spin\nthe unspinnable. BBC, ITV,\nSky News, and Channel 4 all\nhave coverage of some sort,\nthe BBC is usually the more\nserious and formal outlet with\nall the big names and Channel\n4 have Jeremy Paxman, David\nMitchell, and Gogglebox for\na bit more of a light-hearted\ntake. The BBC also includes\nJeremy Vine in his virtual\nreality hell (you\u2019ll know it\nwhen you see it) and the stats\nguru Professor John Curtice,\nthe only man who can keep on\ntop of literally every vote and\nwhat it means. Flick between\nall four channels during the\neight-plus hours of coverage\nfor best effect.\nBy morning, a pretty clear\npicture should have emerged\nand later in the day, if a\nmajority party is present, a\ngovernment will be formed\n(provided The Queen lets\nthem). If there\u2019s no clear\nwinner, that\u2019s when the \u2018fun\u2019\nbegins. Parties will have to\ntry and form a coalition (very\nhard after the Conservative/\nLib Dem coalition in 2010\ndidn\u2019t go swimmingly) and if\nthat fails we\u2019ll either end up\nwith a minority government,\nwhich will find it hard to pass\nlaws and bills, or we might\nend up with another election.\nAnd nobody \u2013 and I stress,\nnobody \u2013 wants that.\nRegardless of your politics\nand regardless of whether\nyou\u2019re voting in a safe seat or\nnot, go out and vote. Take the\nlittle bit of time out of your day\nto exercise your democratic\nright, and even if you don\u2019t\nvote for a particular party, just\nspoil your ballot in a hilarious\nway.\n\\\\ The \u2018main\u2019\nparty manifestos\nare covered in the\nfollowing pages,\nbut do some\nresearch on your\nlocal candidates\ntoo \\\\\nThe Green Party represent\nthe opposite end of politics to\nUKIP, being the party which\nmixes environmentalist and\nleft-wing economics with a\ndollop of progressive politics.\nJointly led by Jonathan Bartley\nand Caroline Lucas (their only\nMP), they are often amongst\nthe top-four parties vote-wise,\nbut due to the electoral system\nthey find it hard to win seats.\nThe largest regional parties,\nthe Scottish National Party\n(SNP) and Plaid Cymru,\nrepresent Scottish and Welsh\ninterests respectively. The SNP\ndoes considerably better out\nof the two and has amassed\n56 MPs as opposed to Plaid\u2019s\nthree.\nThe \u2018main\u2019 party manifestos\nare covered in the following\npages but make sure to do a\nlittle bit of research into your\nlocal party candidates too.\nThe 2015 election results \\\\ Brythones\n\\\\ Voting opens at\n7am on Thursday\nJune 8th\nand\ncontinues until\n10pm the same\nday \\\\\nit\u2019s then a race between\ncertain really competitive\nconstituencies as to who can\n\u2018declare\u2019 their results first. The\nwinner the past few elections\nhas been Houghton and\nSunderland South, with other\nconstituencies in Sunderland\nfollowing close behind. They\ntake it so seriously that voters\nare instructed to only fold their\nvotes once, and the ballot\npapers were reduced from\n100gsm to 80gsm paper, truly\nefficiency at its finest.\nFrom then on the results will\ntrickle in throughout the night,\nthe bulk of which should be\ndeclared by about 3-4am.

No, you\nhaven\u2019t woken\nup from that nap\nin 2020, they\u2019ve\ncalled an early election. Do\nyou have no idea who you\u2019re\nvoting for? Well, you\u2019re in luck\nmy friend, because we\u2019ve got\na whole pull-out complete\nwith manifesto breakdowns,\nand personal views on who\nfellow students are voting for.\nBut before all that, let\u2019s have\na look at the overall state of\naffairs.\nWhat\u2019s happening?\nOn June 8th\na general\nelection is being held to\ndetermine the makeup of the\nUnited Kingdom Parliament,\nin particular the political party\n(or parties) that form Her\nMajesty\u2019s Government (yeah,\nthe Queen still runs it all, on\npaper).\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t the Fixed Term\nParliament Act get passed\nwhich meant general elections\nwould be held every five\nyears (2015, 2020, 2025\netc.)?\u201d I hear you cry \u2013 well\nyes, kinda. While this is still a\nlaw, there\u2019s a loophole in the\nact which means that if two\nthirds of MPs vote for an early\nelection, an early election is\ncalled. But why did the Prime\nMinister, Theresa May, call an\nearly election, and why did\nthe other parties support her?\nMay decided to try and\ncapitalise on her high in the\npolls in order to increase the\nnumber of seats her party\nhas, and in turn make passing\ndecisions through parliament\neasier. May could\u2019ve held out\nuntil the end of the fixed term\nbut with Brexit ever present\nshe likely couldn\u2019t see what\nthe political landscape would\nbe like in three years time \u2013 I\nguess she didn\u2019t have 2020\nvision. The other parties voted\nfor this early election because\nthey had to; if they wanted to\nput themselves in power the\nonly way they could do that\nwould be by an election. Even\nif they knew they were going\nto lose, if they didn\u2019t even\ntry then they\u2019d look weak\n(and certainly not strong and\nstable).\nSo how does the UK\npolitical system work?\nThe whole of the UK\n(England, Wales, Scotland,\nand Northern Ireland) is\nsplit into 650 constituencies\nwho each vote for a single\nMember of Parliament (MP)\nto represent them in the\nHouse of Commons. The vote\nin each constituency takes\nplace via a \u2018First Past The\nPost\u2019 system, whoever gets the\nmost votes wins. This system is\ncriticised as it can lead to vast\nmisrepresentations of how the\nUK as a whole voted in the\nnumber of seats awarded to\nparties. For instance, UKIP\ngarnered 12.7% of the total\nvotes cast but only ended\nup with one MP in the 2015\nelection (until that MP left the\nparty), roughly 0.2% of the\nnumber of seats in House of\nCommons. The opposite has\nalso been seen with the SNP,\nthey achieved 4.7% of the\nvote but gained 8.6% of the\nseats.\nWhetheryou\u2019refororagainst\nthe policies of these parties, it\u2019s\nnot an accurate representation\nof the electorate\u2019s views and\nchanges to the voting system\nare constantly advocated.\nChanging this system to a\n(sorta) proportional one was\nput to a referendum in 2011,\nbut it was a bit of a farce and\nit never got close to passing.\nFurther changes to the\nsystem were to be enacted by\nthe 2020 election, the number\nof MPs was to be dropped to\n600 and the boundaries were\nto be redrawn so that each\nconstituency had roughly the\nsame number of people in it\n(something which currently\nvaries wildly) but these\nchanges obviously didn\u2019t take\nplace in time.\nAnother quirk of the\nsystem is that there\u2019s a slight\ndifference in what an actual\nmajority is. A majority, when\nit comes to votes in the House\nof Commons, actually means\nneeding slightly less than 325\nMPs (half of 650). This is due\nto some MPs not voting, either\nby choice or by design.\nSinn Fein MPs from Northern\nIreland choose not to take\nup their place in Parliament\nas their core belief is for a\nunited Ireland, one which\nisn\u2019t overseen by a British\ngovernment. The Speaker and\nDeputy Speakers of the House\n(the ones who you see shouting\nORRRRRRDDDDERRR) are\nonly allowed to vote in a\ntie, and even then they have\nto vote a certain way. This\nis because even though the\nSpeakers are elected MPs they\nhave to renounce all political\nstances once they take these\nroles to remain impartial,\nwhich sucks if you live in their\nconstituency as you lose your\nelected representative.\nSo who are the main\nparties?\nThe current party in charge\nis the Conservative party\n(nicknamed the Tory party),\nled by Theresa May. May\ninherited the position by virtue\nof being the only one left in\nthe Conservative leadership\nelection, and is aiming to lead\nher party to an even larger\nmajority of MPs than the one\nshe currently commands.\nAiming to spoil her party\u2019s\nparty is Jeremy Corbyn,\nLabour party and opposition\nleader. The Labour party\nare the \u2018opposition\u2019 party\nas they got the second most\nseats and votes behind the\nConservatives. Broadly\nspeaking Labour are left-leaning on the political\nspectrum and the Tories are\nright-leaning. These positions\nare then dragged further\ntoward or from the centre\ndepending on the political\nclimate, the leader of the\nparty, and the issue that\u2019s\nbeing discussed.\nThe Liberal Democrats are\nsomewhat in the mix too,\ncollecting 7.9% of the votes\nin 2015 but getting only eight\nMPs. This is a huge step down\nfrom their 2010 result due to\nthe backlash from the coalition\nthat they entered into with\nthe Tories, which is univerally\nbelieved to have been a bad\nmove for the LibDems. Their\nposition as the minority party\nin the coalition deal meant that\nthey really didn\u2019t have much\nsway and had to backtrack on\nsome key 2010 policies which\nclashed with the Conservative\nstances *cough* tuition fees\n*cough*. They\u2019ve switched\nleaders since then, from Nick\nClegg to Tim Farron, but the\nnorth remembers.\n\\\\ She couldn\u2019t see\nwhat the political\nlandscape would\nbe like in 3 years\ntime \u2013 I guess she\ndidn\u2019t have 2020\nvision \\\\\nThis place is slowly becoming my second home \\\\ STML\nG E 2 0 1 7\n\n"
