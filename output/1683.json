At the beginning\nof this year, I have decided to get an iPhone X:\none of its flagship features\nwas Face ID. It is a great\nfeature and works flaw-lessly, allowing me to use\nmy phone immediately\nafter raising it up from the\ntable. However, one might\nask: how are companies\nand governments going to\nuse my data?\nPractically speaking\nthis is quite an easy\nquestion to answer; eth-ically, not so much. We\ncan discuss examples of\nthe uses of facial recognition software and judge\nwhether they\u2019re right or\nwrong. Does the law of\nthis country, and of all\nAzure platform. Microsoft\nwas one of many sponsors\nbehind ICHack, providing\na whole suite of solutions\nfor application development \u2013 ranging from facial\nrecognition to judging a\nperson\u2019s emotions from\ntheir expression. Now this\nall sounds great in theory,\nand I have nothing against\nMicrosoft or its platform;\nI believe everyone should\nhave access to great\ntechnology. However,\nit\u2019s easy to forget in this\nexcitement about how\nthese services can be\nmanipulated. Almost all\nideas using these services\nwould work best when we\nrecorded the user without\ntheir attention; after all it\u2019s\nbest to see how someone\nis feeling without them\nposing for a selfie. If you\nwere on the app-store and\nsaw an app that would\nrecord you all the time,\nwould you download it?\nRegardless of how much\nof an improvement it\nwould make, would you\nsay yes? How can you be\nsure that the company or\nindividual behind it won\u2019t\nmisuse your data?\nIn a perfect world we\nwould not have to resort\nto tracking every person,\nhowever in this broken\nworld we might just have\nto. A lot of good can come\nof it, we can stop terrorist\nattacks, burglaries and\nviolent attacks to name\na few by ensuring the\nlocation of dangerous individuals are known to the\nauthorities. Once again\nthough, we are coming to\na cross-roads where we\nmust decide if this good\nis coming at the cost of\ntoo much of our privacy.\nFurthermore, we must\nask ourselves whether\nthe grainy CCTV pictures\nwe always see on our TV\nare good enough for an\nartificial intelligence to\njudge whether someone\nwas there or not. Ultimately, at any point in this\ndebate, we can not resort\nto tracking minorities\nand vulnerable groups, as\nlimiting as it may be to\nthe scope of the mass-sur-veillance taking place.\nThe actions in China are\nworthy of condemnation\nand we must never go\ndown a similar path.\nOne of the greatest\nprivacy concerns of facial\nrecognition is that it is\nable to collect its data in\njust a fraction of a second.\nIn Russia, this technology\nis already at large, with\nan app called \u2018FindFace\u2019\nwhich allows you to find a\nperson on Russia\u2019s leading\nsocial media network,\nVKontakte. With our\npersonalities and pictures\nincreasingly out there, it\nwill only become easier to\nfind who we are and what\nwe are like.\nIn one way we\u2019re\nalready giving this power\nto our governments. A\nlot of people get emotional about privacy, but\nno one acts like it\u2019s of\nany importance. Surely,\nit\u2019s not as easy as: \u2018If\nyou\u2019ve got nothing to\nhide you have nothing\nto worry about\u2019? This is\ndefinitely something to\nthink about, especially\nas cognitive-enabled\napplications are created.\nArtificial intelligence is\ncausing a massive stir-up\nin our society, from robots\ntaking over our jobs, to the\nweaponization of it to end\nthe lives of other human\nbeings more effectively.\nAlgorithms can now recognize far more than just age or gender // Mac Observer\nApple\u2019s Face ID uses infrared scanning to let you sign in using just a snap of your face // Bloomberg\n\u201cHowever,\none might\nask: how are\ncompanies and\ngovernments\ngoing to use\nmy data?\u201d\nTECH\nRobert Kaluzny\nTech Writer\nothers, allow for the recognition of the difference\nbetween these right and\nwrong cases? As a computing student who enjoys\ndevelopment in his spare\ntime, this is a question I\nask myself often \u2013 most\nrecently at ICHack 18,\nthis year\u2019s edition of\nthe Imperial College\nHackathon organised by\nDoCSoc.\nOneinstanceofapplication of facial recognition\nsoftware is Microsoft\u2019s\nWhy the latest developments in facial recognition should leave us worried.\n\n"

That\u2019s\ncome around\nquickly. It\nseems like only\na few months ago that\nwe were all gearing up\nfor last year\u2019s Leadership\nElections, and here we\nare already with a whole\nnew set. Well, when I\nsay we were all gearing\nup\u2026 more like those\nwho were running and\nassorted Union hacks, but\nwhen you\u2019re running a\ncampaign it can be hard to\nsee anything outside of it.\nImperial College Union\nregularly prides itself\non having \u2018the biggest\nstudent democracy in the\ncountry\u2019, but what does\nthat really mean? Is there\nany way you can really\nmeasureavalueasabstract\nas democracy? The Union\nhas traditionally done so\nby looking at metrics like\nthe number of candidates\nrunning, and the turnout\nat elections, with completing an online ballot\nstanding in as a proxy for\ndemocratic engagement.\nAnd, to be sure, having\npeople turn up to the polls\nis a hugely vital part of\nany democratic process \u2013\njust look at what happened\nwith the general election\nlast year, where high youth\nturnout swung a number\nof constituencies, not\nleast our own Kensington constituency, which\nturned to Labour despite\nall odds. But democracy\nis not a coat you can shrug\non and off as you feel like\nit; it\u2019s a living, breathing\nbeing that needs continual\nrenewal and engagement.\nIf I seem to be in a bit\nof a pensive mood, that\u2019s\nbecause this election\nmarks something of a\nturning point in my year\nas Felix Editor: all the\nsabbatical officers are\nnow about six months into\nthe job, and soon we\u2019ll\nknow who\u2019ll be taking\nour places (don\u2019t worry,\nthere\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll be\nrunning again). The time\nfor us to make change is\nquickly running out, and\nwe all need to think hard\nabout what we\u2019re going to\ndo as we serve the remainder of our year.\nIt\u2019s with this in mind\nthat I turn to the Union\nitself. While nominations\nare open from this week,\nthey don\u2019t close until\nthe end of February, so\nwe have an entire month\nbefore the big election\nroadshow is kicked off.\nIt\u2019s more than enough\ntime to sit back, reflect,\nand ponder on the state of\nthe Union. What has been\ndone well? What should\nwe focus on for next year?\nOr should we just scrap\nthe whole damn system\nand start again? These are\nthe kind of questions Felix\nwill be examining over\nthe next few weeks.\nI know some of you\nmight find all this talk of\nUnion politics awfully\ndull \u2013 you just want to\nskip through to the cen-trefold (two this week!),\nHangman, and the puzzles\nsection. It\u2019s cool, I get you.\nBut if you\u2019ve had enough\nof pontificating about the\nnature of democracy, I\nhave one suggestion: run\nfor Felix Editor yourself.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed \u2013 we\u2019ll teach you\neverything you need to know. If you\u2019re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk\nWhat is the debate about?\nThe debate centres around proposed\nchanges to pension schemes for university\nstaff. The current pension scheme used\nin higher education is the University\nSuperannuation Scheme (USS) \u2013 a defined\nbenefit pensions scheme in which the\nemployer is responsible for contributions\nup to a salary of \u00a355,550. Beyond this, the\nUSS switches to a defined contribution\nscheme, where pension value is linked to the\nperformance of the stock market.\nUUK proposes to end the defined benefit\nscheme and switch to a fully defined\ncontribution scheme \u2013 a move UCU general\nsecretary Sally Hunt called \u201cthe worst\nproposal I have received in twenty years of\nrepresenting university staff\u201d. Alistair Jarvis,\nthe chief executive of UUK, has said the\nchanges are necessary to\u201censure the scheme\nremains sustainable.\u201d Sam Gyimah, the new\nuniversities minister, however, last month\nwrotetoEllieReesMPsayingtheUSSpension\nscheme was\u201cstrong and stable\u201d.\nDr Michael McGarvey, President of\nImperial College UCU, told Felix:\u201cDepending\non calculations \u2013 which are highly contested\n\u2013 the increased contributions required to\nfund the defined benefit USS pensions might\nbe very little, or \u2013 at the very most \u2013 10% of\nImperial\u2019s annual operating surplus\u201d\nThere are concerns this could leave\npension funds at the mercy of fluctuations\nof the stock market in the future. Last year\nProfessor Michael Otsuka, of the London\nSchool of Economics, estimated for some\nstaffswitchingtothenewschemewouldlead\nto a reduction in the value of their pension\nof 60%. An Imperial working group, which\nwas commissioned by College management,\nproduced a critique of the basis upon which\nUUK is recommending changes, saying \u201clack\nof transparency remains a key issue\u201d in the\ndebate.\ndisruption to their edu-cation, and we will work\nwith departments and the\nstudents\u2019 union to discuss\nand implement mitigation\nplans. We hope to keep\ndisruption to a minimum.\u201d\nThe National Union of\nStudents (NUS) this week\nissued a joint statement\nwith UCU, saying they\nwere \u201csister organisations\ncommitted to promoting the interests of our\nmembers and defending\neducation\u201d. The unions\nsaid they were \u201cproud\nof our work together in\ncalling for a better deal for\nstudents and staff\u201d, and the\nNUS asked its members\nto \u201ccontinue to call for the\nuniversity employers to\nrecognise the seriousness\npensions, but have chosen\nnot to.\n\u201cAt a time when real\npay has fallen by around\n20% since 2009 and staff\nfacilities are being withdrawn (the latest being\nthe swimming pool at the\nSt. Mary\u2019s Campus), this\nis another disappointing\nindication of the value\nmanagement place on\nstaff at Imperial.\u201d\nA College spokesperson informed Felix that\nUCU notified them of 522\nmembers at Imperial, of\nwhom 276 are academic\nstaff, 102 are research\nstaff, and the remainder\nare postgraduate stu-dents, or administrative\nand managerial staff.

The result is an eclectic jumble that oozes colour.\nI\nt would\u2019ve been a\ngood name for a marbled paper collage\nI made about four\nyears ago \u2013 or at least a\nbetter one than whatever\nhedonistic tripe I presumably came up with.\nMarble Skies, British\nart-rock quartet Django\nDjango\u2019s third album,\nactually bears something\nof a resemblance to my\nteenage artistic endeav-ours. Though a patchwork\nof shapes, styles, and\nmoods, each piece fits\ntogether with surprising\ncoherence, and the whole\nthing is coated in a vi-brant, psychedelic, spacey\nglaze.\nThe opening and\ntitular track immediately\nindicates a clear departure\nfrom the feel of their\nprevious album. Born\nUnder Saturn was very\nmuch dominated by big\nsounds, pounding and\nplodding through steady\nbeats and muscular riffs.\n\u2018Marble Skies\u2019 conveys a\nnew sense of urgency, an\nassured charge that sees\nthem deftly sweeping\nthrough layers of Kraftwerk-esque retrofuturism,\npunctuated by fast-paced\nverses. \u201cTake us as we\nare\u201d, the chorus boldly\ndeclares - they\u2019ve never\nsounded more confident\nin their style.\nSomething previously\nalien to Django Django\u2019s\ndiscography comes with\nsecond track \u2018Surface to\nAir\u2019, in the form of guest\nvocals from Slow Club\u2019s\nRebecca Taylor, reincarnated as her new solo\nproject, Self Esteem. The\ntempo drops a bit for this\none, and it feels somewhat\nlimp in comparison to\nits predecessor. Usual\nprogress is soon resumed,\nhowever, with \u2018Champagne\u2019, which is reminis\u201cIs it a bit\nsuperficial?\nPotentially. Is\nit enjoyable?\nInarguably\u201d\n\u201cAn assured\ncharge\nthat sees\nthem deftly\nsweeping\nthrough layers\nof Kraftwerkesque\nretrofuturism\u201d\ncent of their first album.\nStaccato guitars, whirling\nsynths, and a faint background of elevator music\nmake this a pleasant but\nlargely forgettable track.\nNext up is energetic\nlead single \u2018Tic Tac Toe\u2019.\nBehind its throbbing\nbassline and chugging\ndrumbeat, the lyrics draw\non themes of nihilism and\nthe banal repetitiveness\nof modern, consumerist\nlife (\u201cLately, have you\never wondered why we\u2019re\nput here / playing each\nand every game / day\nby day?\u201d). As always,\nthe sounds are texturally\nrich and the production\nimmaculate, and though\nit may initially sound like\nsomething of a throw-away, closer inspection\nreveals evidence of their\nmeticulous studio crafts-manship.\nAfter a short burst of\nspace rock in the form\nof \u2018Further\u2019, with its\njangly riffs and spiralling\nmellotron, the album\nreally starts to take\nshape. The understated\nand wistful \u2018Sundials\u2019 is\nperhaps their most tender\nmoment to date. With a\nnaked piano riff taking\ncentre stage, shy Beach\nBoys harmonies glide\nethereally over distant\nreverb and sublime saxophone interludes. The\nserenity is soon disturbed,\nhowever, by the syncopated intro of \u2018Beam Me Up\u2019.\nThis dark and brooding\ntrack is a real standout.\nThe sound is industrial and\nbleak; the familiar falsetto\nniceties are dropped in\nfavour of a chilling but\npurposeful delivery,\nlaid over an undulating\nbass and a progressive\nsynth accompaniment. It\nwouldn\u2019t be out of place\non a Horrors album, or\nalongside some of Alt-J\u2019s\nmore lively work. Double-tracked vocals and\ndense sonic layers give it\na very intense, full-bodied\nflavour that makes for\nan impressive auditory\nexperience.\nPulling a tight hairpin\nonce again, \u2018In your\nBeat\u2019 is a straight up\npop banger. With an\nuplifting sing-along\nchorus about dancing,\nyou\u2019d be forgiven for\nmistaking it for a Calvin\nHarris record. There are\nhyperbolic builds, even a\ndrop. Perhaps this is their\nattempt to break out into\nthe mainstream, or maybe\nthey just wanted to take\na rest from being opaque\nand artsy to make a fun\nfeel-good song. Either\nway, it\u2019s perfect for radio\nplay, indie disco playlists\nand sun-soaked festival\nsets. Is it a bit superficial?\nPotentially. Is it enjoya-ble? Inarguably.\nLaser guns and bouncy\nbeats fill the extended\nintro of \u2018Real Gone\u2019 with\na very LCD Soundsystem\nfeel, before switching\nto a Jagwar Ma style\nelectronic piece. Eventually, the high octane\ndrum machine gives way\nto a gentle tinkle and fade\ninto \u2018Fountains\u2019. German\nelectronic and krautrock\npioneers Kraftwerk are\nchannelled once again,\nthis time via panpipes\nthat could\u2019ve been lifted\nstraight from \u2018Autobahn\u2019.\nFrontman Vincent Neff\nshows his vocal prowess\nhere, with delicate,\nsustained high notes\nand buoyant transitions,\nnot dissimilar to that on\nJungle\u2019s eponymous 2014\nrecord. Despite the recurring nihilistic themes,\nthe LP closes on a note\nof optimistic agnosticism\nand acceptance.\nOver ten short and\nreasonably disconnected\ntracks, Django Django\ndabble in a variety of\ngenres, but wholly\ncommit to none. There\u2019s a\ndistinct shift towards pop,\nbut not at the expense of\nartistic integrity. It\u2019s extremely playable and only\ngets more infectious upon\nrepetition. While Marble\nSkies likely won\u2019t be held\nin as high regard as their\nmercury prize nominated\ndebut, it serves as an\nimportant stepping stone\nthat secures their position\nas ones to watch and keep\nwatching.\nMark Rothko eat your heart out // Ribbon Music\nMUSIC\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Django Django.\nLabel: Ribbon Music Top\nTracks: Beam Me Up;\nSundials.

Smith\nMUSIC\nJack O\u2019Brien\nMusic Writer\nT\no pretend that\nthe clamorous\nand lengthy\ndiscography of\nThe Fall, the fabled post\npunk band spearheaded\nby the imperious and now\ndeceased Mark E. Smith,\nhas shaped and defined\nmy musical tastes would\nbe a lie. I cannot claim\nthat the fractious frontman\nserved, as he has to so\nmany others, as a particularly important influence\non my musical inclination\nup until his death, or at\nleast not consciously.\nInstead, the influence\nof his now silent raspy\nMancunian voice, best\nheard conjuring up bizarre\nand uncouth imagery over\nrepetitive guitar riffs, had\nbeen a wayward one in my\nlife. Smith existed to me\nas the man behind such\nbelters as \u2018Hit the North\u2019,\n\u2018Totally Wired\u2019 and \u2018Hard\nlife in the Country\u2019. He\nwas the notoriously acerbic delinquent with the\nfamously quick temper\nand tendency towards\nphysical violence. He was\nthe endlessly endorsed\nand recommended artist\u2019s artist, upheld and\nwritten about at length\nby journalists far trendier\nand more talented than\nI. He existed as a spectre;\na wraith whose work I\nnever fully indulged, a\ncultural behemoth I never\nfully absorbed.\nIt is for this reason\nthat it seemed weird that\nafter the announcement\nof his passing on 24th\nJanuary, I felt a sense of\nloss usually reserved for\nartists who have held a\nmore significant sway on\nmy tastes. Even after the\ndeath of Prince or Bowie,\nartists who by the brute\nforce of radio-friendly\nosmosis I had imbibed\nalmost endlessly, I didn\u2019t\nfeel as bothered as when I\nheard the news of Smith\u2019s\nelicited such a peculiarly\nstrong response. Am I so\nsentimental as to mourn\nthe loss of those I barely\nknew, especially in the\ncase of an obscurity like\nSmith?\nAn answer, at least in\npart, emerged a few days\nlater when the comedian\nStewart Lee, an apparent\nFall mega fan, appeared\non Radio 6. Lee commented that whereas\neveryone had some\nconnection to the deaths\nof Bowie and Prince,\nMark E. Smith remained\nunique as having a deep\nand fruitful connection\nwith a minority. He was\nthe pioneer of a band\nsealed into legend not by\nthe mass act of popular\nidolisation, but instead\nby the intense adoration\nof a few. The Fall was the\nmost famously unknown\nband of all time - an\never shifting ensemble\nof musicians bundled\ntogether by its leader.\nThey were only loved by\nthose for whom the penny\nhad dropped, those who\nhad, at the least, made the\neffort to discover them in\ndepth.\nThe upset I felt at his\ndeath has been realised\nas the knowledge that\nI would have loved his\nmusic while he lived,\nthat, for me, the penny\ndid not drop while he\nwas alive. He was not the\nwraith I thought he was,\na grumbling ghost on\nthe fringes of my tastes,\nbut a staunchly northern\npoet who domineered a\nscene with such relentless temerity that I feel\nashamed to remark that\nit is only now that I have\nbegun to explore his work.\nI have cruelly learned\nwhat I was missing. In\nthe past few days, I have\nrevelled and nourished my\nsoul on the cold northern\nabstraction of his cryptic\nlyrics. I have hijacked\nspeakers so that I may\nbelt out his Godly tunes\nfor my own indulgence in\nthe presence of gentiles,\nand even dozed off into\nviolent dreams at the\nbehest of his eclectically\nangry music. I am sure\nthe commentariat who\nheld Mark E. Smith as a\npinnacle of creativity are\nenvious of the freshness\nwith which I now tuck\ninto iconic old albums and\nperformances. I am sure\nthat they too share the\nselfish glee I now take in\ngetting to know the well\ncurated museum of Mark\nE. Smith, with its varied\nand seemingly endless list\nof quirks.\nI lament never seeing\nhim live, as I was urged\nto do by my annoyingly\nprescient brother. Instead,\nI can only take solace in\nthe poetry of an artist\nI have come to late, an\nartist I missed before I\neven knew it, who said\nthings I wish I could have.\n\u201cYell down nights in\nhysterical breath / Those\nNorthern Lights, so pretty\n/ Those big big big wide\nstreets / Those useless\nMPs / Savages\u201d\nRIP Mark E. Smith.\nIn light of the passing of legendary The Fall frontman Mark E. Smith, Felix\u2019s hottest new music writer offers his\nown profound and earth-shattering insights into an artist he knew too little about.\nMark E. Smith passed away on January 24th. His Legacy, however, lives on. // Flickr/ neate photos\n\u201cHe was the\npioneer of a\nband sealed\ninto legend\nnot by the\nmass act\nof popular\nidolisation,\nbut instead\nby the intense\nadoration of a\nfew\u201d\npassing. This led me to\nwondering as to why an\nartist who had existed\nonly in my periphery had\n\n"

Bacteria\ngaining resistance is a\nnatural process, but this\nhas been accelerated by\nthe misuse of medicines.\nThe consequence of this\nis that bacteria remain\nunaffected by our current\nmedications, leading to\nlonger stays in the hospi-tal, greater medical costs\nand increased mortality.\nThe way to combat antibiotic resistance in bacteria\nis to develop new drugs\nthat can kill them. The\ndrug development process\nset by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) is\na long and costly process,\ncoupled with uncertainty\non whether a new drug\nwill actually succeed to\nthe next stage.\nWhile this ensures the\nmedicines you use are\nsafe, the downside is that\nit can take decades for\na drug to finally reach\nthe shelf of your local\npharmacy. To accelerate\nthe process, scientists and\nengineers across disci-inside a research system\nsimilar to a computer. The\ninstrument is designed to\nrecreate the environment\nof the human body, such\nas airflow. Medicines,\nFDA announced that they\nare entering a multi-year\nresearch and development\nagreement with Emulate\nInc. They will be evaluating their Organs-on-Chips\n(OOCs) technology to\ncheck if they can be\nused in the drug testing\nprocess. There are three\ncomponents to OOCs:\nOrgan-chips, instrumentation and apps.\nThe organ-chips are\nthe size of an AA battery.\nThey are lined with living\nhuman cells and have\nmicrofluidic channels that\ncan allow the flow of air\nor blood, just like in the\nhuman body. The chips are\nflexible, allowing motions\nlike breathing or muscle\ncontraction to be simulat-ed. They are also transpar-ent, allowing researchers\nto analyse the organ\u2019s\nfunctionality, behavior\nand response at a cellular\nlevel. Some examples of\nOOCs include: Bloodvessel-chips, liver-chips,\nlung-chips, etc.\nOOCs are placed\nthem.\nApps help provide\nprecise control of an\nOOC\u2019s living microenvi-ronment and configure the\ncell architecture amongst\nother functions.\nRecently, a team of\nresearchers from the\nDivision of Hemostasis\nand Thrombosis at Beth\nIsrael Deaconess Medical\nCenter (BIDMC) collaborated with the Wyss\nInstitute and discovered,\nusing a blood-vessel-on-a-chip, small molecules\ncalled parmodulins. They\nprovide anti-inflammatory\nand antithrombotic protection to endothelial cells\nwithout interfering with\nthe blood clotting process.\nThis property makes par-modulins good candidates\nfor new drugs. Through\nthis study, one can see\nhow OOCs can accelerate\nthe safer development and\nevaluation of drugs.\nWyss Institute founding\ndirector Dr Donald Ingber\nalso proposed that OOCs\ncan replace animal testing\nearly in the drug development process to ensure\ngreater efficacy and safety.\nOne of the main problems\nwith animal testing is that\nthe drugs are tested in cells\nthat don\u2019t function exactly\nlike those in the human\nbody. Hence, researchers\nneed to do extensive\nexperiments to check for\npotential side-effects in\nhumans, which can take\nmany months. According\nto the Nature journal,\n85% of drugs fail in early\nclinical trials due to this.\nDr Ingber proposed that\nby injecting drugs into\nan OOC, researchers\ncan analyse the effects\nof the drug on human\ntissue itself at an early\nstage without potentially harming humans.\nHowever, while animals\ncan shed light on how the\ndrug can affect behavior,\nOOCs only show physiological effects of the drug\non a small group of cells.\nIf OOCs are to become\nthe next-generation\nmethod of drug development and research in\nvarious industries, they\nneed to be able to be\nmass-manufactured and\nautomated, ensuring\nthat they are produced\ncontinuously with quality\ncontrol. Up till now, they\nhave been manufactured\nin small batches to be used\nin academic research.\nEarlier this month,\nHarvard published a study\nin the journal Biofabrication that described a new,\nfaster method for manufacturing hearts-on-chips.\nDr Lisa Scudder, co-lead\nauthor of the study, said:\n\u201cOur new heart-on-a-chip\nfabrication method uses\na UV laser to pattern the\nhydrogel, employing\nriboflavin to sensitise the\ngel for optical ablation\u2026\n[This] creates features on\nthe gel much faster, but\nwith the same resolution\nand reproducibility, as\ntraditional moulding techniques.\u201d\nDr Janna Nawroth, the\nco-lead author, added that\nthe process is scalable,\n60% faster than the old\nprocess, and gives uniformity without altering\nthe hydrogel properties.\nThis makes the technology a step closer to mass\nproduction and use by\npharmaceutical compa-nies.\nThough OOCs are not\nyet ready to be mass-pro-duced and distributed,\ngood progress has been\nmade in showcasing its\npotential in drug-test-ing, suggesting a more\nefficient future for the\nprocess.\n\u201cAntibiotic\nresistance in\nbacteria is one\nof the biggest\nthreats to\nglobal health\u201d\n\u201cIt can take\ndecades for a\ndrug to finally\nreach the shelf\nof your local\npharmacy\u201d\nYes, that\u2019s an organ // Harvard\nplines are collaborating to\nfind new drugs and drug\ntesting methods. One such\ngroup is Emulate Inc.,\na Wyss Institute (from\nHarvard University) start-up.\nIn April of last year, the\nchemicals and other toxins\ncan be introduced into the\nchip via the instrument\nand the effect of them on\nthe cells lining the chip\ncan be analysed due to\nthe modular nature of the\nsystem. OOCs can also be\nconnected together using\nthe instrument to better\nunderstand the interactions between different\norgans and the effect of\nforeign substances on\n\n"

The scene, which\nis several minutes long, is\na masterclass in naturalistic acting, and ingenious\nwriting \u2013 it takes place\nin near silence, and for a\ngood portion of the time\nthe stage is empty, save\nfor dozens of dolls that\nstare out into the audience\nwith unblinking glass\neyes \u2013 we can only guess\nat Burke\u2019s movements by\nthe sound of her footsteps\nin the rafters. From these\nfirst moments, in a cast of\nimmensely capable actors,\nBurke is the runaway\nstar. She commands the\nstage with her soft spoken\nvoice and deliberate, quiet\ngrace.\nEventually we meet Eli\n(Tom Mothersdale) and\nJenny (Anneika Rose),\na New York couple that\ncome to stay at Mertis\u2019\nB&B. Though at first they\nseemingly appear happy\nand in love, we soon see\nthat their relationship\nis on the rocks, despite\ntheir best efforts. We\nhear snatches of arguments floating down the\nstairs on their first night,\nand then rapidly their\ndisagreements spill out\ninto the public. Just as\nthe heating in their room\nwill not switch on, the\nchill in their relationship\nrefuses to thaw. Hamfisted\nattempts by the two to\ndraw the other out lead\nto escalations: when at\nhis behest Jenny tries\nto be candid about her\ndisgust at Eli slurping\ncereal, he accuses her of\nanti-semitism: \u201cLike, oh\nJesus, the big loud hairy\nJew is like smacking his\nlips again and chewing\nwith his mouth open and\nit\u2019s totally repulsive.\u201d\nNothing will convince\nhim that that is not what\nshe meant.At times it feels\nclaustrophobic watching\nthese desperate, intimate\narguments on the cluttered\nstage because they sound\nso real. Bakers has such an\nuncanny talent for writing\ndialogue, her characters\nstop and start when they\ngo to talk, bumble through\nwhat they say, the writing\nis so precise it sounds\nimprovised: it is easy\nto wonder what these\nreal-life people are doing\nup on stage.\nBaker\u2019s writing is\ncleverinotherways:\u201chave\nyou ever felt watched?\u201d\nMertis asks Jenny over\na glass of wine towards\nthe end of the second act.\nJenny looks out into the\naudience where hundreds\nof pairs of eyes intently\nlook back. \u201cNo,\u201d she says\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d After\na pause, she revises her\nanswer, admitting that she\nhad always felt judged\nby a childhood doll who\nto her seemed furious at\nher. To Mertis\u2019 friend,\nGenevieve, played by a\nfantastic June Watson,\nthis seems entirely\nnatural. \u201cOf course she\nwas angry!\u201d she exclaims,\n\u201cto be a piece of plastic...\nto be shaped into a human\nform and trapped! People\nmanhandling you. And\nthen put in a dress. Put\nin an itchy little dress!\u201d\nThis scene in which the\nthree exceptional female\nleads sit around a table\ndiscussing their lives\nreveals John as quietly\nfeminist \u2013 of course these\nwomen know what it is to\nbe angry at being objecti-fied, how could they not?\nBaker\u2019s frequent\nallusions to being\nwatched echoes Margaret\nAtwood\u2019s The Robber\nBride, in which Atwood\nwrites that that everything\na woman does, \u201cincluding\nnot catering to male fan-tasies, is a male fantasy:\n...pretending you have a\nlife of your own... unconscious of the ever-present\nwatcher peering through\nthe keyhole, peering\nthrough the keyhole in\nyour own head, if nowhere\nelse\u201d. Atwood\u2019s words\n\u201cyou are a woman with\na man inside watching a\nwoman\u201d are never truer\nthan in the case of Genevieve, an elderly blind\nwoman who for many\nyears had felt her ex-hus-band had control of her\nmind and was dictating\nher every action.\nBaker\u2019s writing finds a\nperfect partner in director\nJames MacDonald, whose\napproach is considered\nand cinematic. Over the\ncourse of nearly three and\na half hours, he allows\nBaker\u2019s characters to\nevolve gradually, occupying the stage at the edges,\nor sometimes not at all,\nmaking the events that\nmuch closer, more real.\nBaker\u2019s meditations on\nloneliness, and our power\nto acutely and precisely\nhurt those we know the\nbest are powerful. The\nonly missteps she makes\nare in her conscious effort\nto be spooky: Christmas\nlights flicker ominously,\nthere are references to\nquasi-sentient rooms; all\nof this is unnecessary,\nJohn is haunting enough\nwithout the addition\nof actual ghosts. This\nsingular, brilliant play\ncements Baker\u2019s position\nas one of the best, most\ninteresting playwrights\nworking today.\nThe story of a failing relationship in a possibly haunted B&B is a showcase of playwright Annie Baker\u2019s genius.\nTom Mothersdale and Anneika Rose in Annie Baker\u2019s John // Stephen Cummiskey\nARTS\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nWhere?

If we are to ascribe\nto the films of Richard\nLinklater a mission state-ment, however, it would\nbe to make that land fa-miliar. Or rather, familiar\nenough.\nLinklater is a director\nwho trades in nostalgia,\nan emotion generated by\nimages and objects that\nare tantalisingly familiar,\nand yet achingly inacces-sible. From capturing the\nmemories that will later be\ntinted with a rose-colour-ed nostalgia \u2013 as in Before\nSunrise, or Everybody\nWants Some! \u2013 or having\ncharacters watch events\nplay out and turn into\nmemories before their\nvery eyes \u2013 as in Patricia\nArquette\u2019s matriarch in\nBoyhood \u2013 Linklater is\nat his most comfortable\nwhen bringing the past\nwithin touching distance\nof an audience.\nIn theory, then, Last\nFlag Flying, his sequel\nto Hal Ashby\u2019s 1973 film\nThe Last Detail, should\nsee him on home territory.\nWe follow three Vietnam\nveterans, reuniting in the\nnear past of 2003, and reflecting on the experiences that shaped them thirty\nyears before, thus generating a form of memory\nthat is twice-removed\nfrom the viewer. With\nthe audience re-engaging\n\u201cWith Last\nFlag Flying,\nLinklater is\ntoo concerned\nwith wallowing\nin the past,\nrather than\nreflecting on\nit\u201d\n\u201cAs usual,\nLinklater\ndelivers\npunchy\ndialogue, with\nthe cracks\ncoming thick\nand fast\u201d\nwith their experiences of\nnearly 15 years ago, and\nthe characters reaching\nfurther back into decades\ngone by, Linklater is on\nfamiliar territory. What\na pity, then, that the film\nremains little more than\na by-the-numbers affair,\nwhich quickly becomes\nsentimental, losing any\npolitical clout in a maudlin\nsensibility.\nSteve Carell plays\n\u2018Doc\u2019,whowascourt-martialed and imprisoned as a\nyoung man serving in the\nmilitary. Now, thirty years\nlater, an America still\nreeling from the shock\nof 9/11 has embarked on\nanother seemingly-point-less war, which has\nresulted in Doc\u2019s son\u2019s\ndeath in Baghdad. With\nthe narrative thrust justly\nprovided, Doc seeks out\nhis old marine buddies\n\u2013 Sal (Bryan Cranston)\nand Mueller (Laurence\nFishburne) \u2013 to help him\nescort his son\u2019s body back\nhome.\nNaturally this is easier\nsaid than done, and \u2013 amid\nsome terse conversations\nwith Colonel Willetts,\nan anaemic attempt at\nan antagonist played by\nYul Vazquez \u2013 the men\nare forced to take the\ntrain through the Eastern\nstates, accompanying the\nyoung man\u2019s body. Lo and\nbehold \u2013 another buddy\nmovie.\nAs usual, Linklater\ndelivers punchy dialogue,\nwith the cracks coming\nthick and fast, but there\nis a sense that he is abandoning the naturalistic\napproach he took with\nBoyhood for a more\ncontrived script. The\nthree characters have\nclearly-defined roles\nwithin the narrative:\nCarell\u2019s performance is\nthe most impressive, with\na willfully-restrained\nembodiment of Doc,\nwho stands quietly at the\nperiphery of most scenes.\nIt\u2019s a welcome contrast\nto Cranston, who ratchets\nup his wise-cracking\nboozehound to the n-th\ndegree, until Sal is little\nmore than a caricature\nof what war does to the\nindividual. Linklater\nindulges this character far\ntoo much, and it quickly\nbecomes tiresome. Fishburne delivers his lines\nwith his usual gravitas\n\u2013 fitting since Mueller\nhas reformed since his\nold days, and is now an\nordained minister \u2013 but\nthere is little out of the\nordinary in his perfor-mance.\nWhere the film really\ndisappoints, however, is\nin its attempts to form a\ncritique of the political\nenvironment of the ear-ly-noughties, in particular\nAmerican foreign policy.\nThe action occurs against\nthe backdrop of Saddam\nHussein\u2019s capture, less\nthan a year into a war\nin Iraq that would leave\nhundreds of thousands\ndead. Characters begin\nto make motions towards\ncriticism of the state,\nbut Linklater always has\nthem pull back, segueing\ninstead to discussions\nabout Eminem or the\nrapidly-developing cell\nphone technology.\nIt has been more than\n14 years since the beginning of the Iraq War, and\n16 years since September\n11th \u2013 we are now further\naway from that point in\ntime than the characters\nin the film are from the\nfall of the Berlin Wall. It\u2019s\nmore than enough time\nfor a director to take on\nthe challenge of critical\nreflection, to engage with\nour own recent past, but\nsadly Linklater fails to\ndeliver. His characters\nalways stop short of\nsaying anything outright,\nand \u2013 as a result \u2013 they\ndon\u2019t say anything at all.\nWith Last Flag Flying, he\nis too concerned with wallowing in the past, rather\nthan reflecting on it.\nSteve didn\u2019t get the memo about the dress code // Amazon/Lionsgate\nDir: Richard Linklater.\nScript: Richard Linklater;\nDarryl Ponicsan.

He\nis the head of Imperial\nCollege\u2019s own Neuropsychopharmacology\nUnit, of which the\nPsychedelic Research\nGroup is a part. Sebastian\nGonzato caught up with\nhim to find out more about\nwhat this group does.\nWhat does the Psychedelic Research\nGroup study and to\nwhat end?\nThe group has been\naround since even before\nI arrived at Imperial,\nand it has two aims \u2013 to\ninvestigate the possible\ntherapeutic uses of psych-edelics, as well as to understand the experience of\npsychedelia. The latter is a\nvery old question indeed.\nWilliam James, a 19th\ncentury American philosopher and psychologist,\nfamously wrote that \u201cno\naccount of the universe in\nits totality can exist that\nleaves these [alterations of\nconsciousness] disregarded\u201d. The question then is\nhow to do so? Today we\nhave brain imaging so we\nare able to, in a way, \u2018look\ninside people\u2019s heads\u2019 and\nfind out what\u2019s happening.\nAnd what effect do\npsychedelics have on\nthe brain then?\nAll the psychedelics\nwe\u2019ve investigated \u2013\npsilocybin, LSD and now\nDMT \u2013 they all induce\nwhat we\u2019ve called \u2018the\nentropic state of the\nbrain\u2019. The process of\nlearning involves your\nbrain becoming more\nrigid, more constrained,\nbut psychedelics disrupts\nour normal thought\npatterns by making\nconnections in the brain\nthat aren\u2019t usually there.\nIt\u2019s this entropic state of\nthe brain that we believe\ngive psychedelics their\ntherapeutic value.\nHow so?\nTake a disorder like\ndepression. People who\nare depressed ruminate\nover the same depressing\nthoughts over and over\nagain, but psychedelics\ncan break these patterns.\nWe recently published a\nstudy in October where\nwe gave 20 patients\nwith treatment-resistant\ndepression psilocybin\nin a therapeutic setting.\nThey all experienced\na single trip, and all of\nWhat are the challenges you face in\ncarrying out your\nstudies?\nThe psilocybin study\nwas in fact a safety\nstudy, but we\u2019re unable\nto do any further studies\nbecause psilocybin is\nillegal. We\u2019ve had the\nstudy approved by an\nethics committee, but it\u2019s\nvery difficult in the UK to\nobtain the drug. In other\ncountries, as you may\nknow, this is not the case.\nPsilocybin is legal (in\ntruffle form) in Holland\nfor example, and there\u2019s\na huge industry in illegal\ntreatments using it.\nThat most psychedelics\nare illegal is a real shame,\nbecause we know from\nour study and others\nthat they could be of\ntherapeutic use. There\u2019s\na great amount of historical research into LSD for\nexample. The US government funded 140 medical\nstudies into the drug, but\nthen this was stopped due\nto the hippie movement\nin the \u201860s when it was\nmade illegal. In fact, LSD\nis the only drug which\nwas banned because it\nchanged the way people\nvoted, and the Republican\nparty was afraid of this.\nWe\u2019ve started seeing\ndecriminalisation of drug\npossession in some countries such as Portugal, but\nwe really need policies\nthat allow these drugs\nto be studied and allow\ndoctors to decide whether\nthey should be prescribed\nor not.\nTo listen to a longer\nversion of the interview,\nvisit http://bit.ly/2nmDw-vI\nSCIENCE\nSebastian Gonzato\nScience Writer\nDavid Nutt chats LSD with Seb // Imperial/Wikimedia\n\u201cPsychedelics\ndistrupt\nour normal\nthought\npatterns,\nmaking\nconnections\nthat aren\u2019t\nusually there\u201d\nthem experienced some\nimprovement in well-be-ing immediately after.

The Immortals\ndefense stifled the\nPython\u2019s running game,\nwith Jacob \u201cmore MVPs\nthan socials\u201d Lamb and\nDom \u201chave you heard my\nmixtape?\u201d DeSilva giving\nthe opposing running\nbacks no room to breathe.\nThe revamped offense\nalso took the game to\nCambridge, with Ben\n\u201cskips first and goes for\nthe home run\u201d O\u2019Brien,\nHarry \u201cNaCl\u201d Lawrence\nand Tom \u201cMr chripse\nyour ex\u201d Smith consistently carving through.\nLawrence would find the\nfensive line were winning\nthe battle in the trenches,\nwith veteran Daniel \u201c4\nmore years\u201d Grumberg\nleading the way.\nThe second half saw\nthe Pythons bite back,\nhowever. An error on\nspecial teams lead to\nexcellent field position\nfor Cambridge for the\nopening drive of the third\nquarter, who duly converted it into a touchdown of\ntheir own to tie the game\nat 6-6.\nThe Immortals would\nreply with a big drive of\ntheir own, driving the ball\nto the Pythons\u2019 goal line.\nTo their credit, Cambridge\nstepped up their game, and\na big goal line stand would\nkeep the scores even as\nthe Imperial offense failed\nto punch it in.\nInexperience and a lack\nof numbers began to take\nits toll on Imperial as the\ngame wore on, however\nthe desire to win was still\nthere as the Immortals\ncontinued to make big\nplays. One highlight was\nAnuj \u201closes to green boi\u201d\nMehra putting a crunching\nhit on their key player, a\nmove that rejuvenated the\nwhole Immortals squad.\nAnd it was in dou-ble-overtime where the\nImmortals would strike.\nLawrence connecting\nwith Lukas \u201cnickname\nnot appropriate for Felix\u201d\nHann to send the Imperial\nside line into rapture.\nThe teams will meet\nagain at Harlington in two\nweeks\u2019 time.\nBecome Immortal\ntoday and come play\nAmerican Football for the\nbest university team in\nLondon.\nContact Immortals at\namerican.football@ic.ac.\nuk\nImperial 1st\nXV lose to Brunel in tough contest\nL\nast Wednesday\nmarked the return\nof ICURFC 1st\nXV to rugby\nafter Christmas, in which\nthey took on Brunel\nUniversity. Following\na close loss to Brunel\nin November, last time\nthese teams met, Imperial\nwere determined not to\nlet history repeat itself.\nThe cold, windy and wet\nconditions at Harlington\ncouldn\u2019t dampen our spir-its. We started strongly,\nand our forwards were\nable to truck the ball up\ninto Brunel\u2019s 22. Quick\nhands from flyhalf Harry\nAllingham allowed Alex\nAmato to run over for\nan easy try. With James\nField\u2019s conversion we\nwere 7-0 up early in the\ngame. Dropped balls and\npoor discipline prevented\nus from gaining attacking\nmomentum for the rest of\nthe first half. Brunel kept\ngot up and turned over the\nball after making a tackle.\nBrunel\u2019s talkative inside\ncentre was also soon introduced to the ground when\nhe tried to run through\nIsaac Bailey and was, less\nthan politely, made to sit\ndown. Unfortunately, our\neager defence gave away\na penalty for being offside\nand Brunel made the score\n7-3 from the tee.\nThe second half started\nexactly how the first half\nhadn\u2019t. The team had\nswitched off. Holes in\ndefence started to appear\nand IC failed to keep\npossession of the ball.\nThis allowed Brunel to\nscore two tries in quick\nsuccession, making the\nscore 7-15. However, all\nhope was not yet lost. Line\nbreaks and Big Carries\nfrom Big T, Big Nate\nand Big Shuz inspired\nthe team to turn the game\naround.

And he now hates more people\nthan ever before.\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nT\nhis week, I have\nbegun to cycle\nmore. I\u2019m a big\nfan of cycling because one of my favourite\npeople in the whole of the\nUK is a large advocate\nof it. Yes, he might break\nranks in the Tory cabinet\nand tell outright lies, but\nat least his hair looks\nfantastic perched on top of\nhis head, like immaculate\nthatch on a traditional\nBritish cottage. I could\nalmost write dedicated\nlove poetry for Bo Jo, but\nI\u2019d certainly feel like I was\ncheating on the King of\nthe Tories, or as he would\nprefer it, Rex Cuntz. ReesMogg and his charmingly\nelitist outlook is what gets\nme out of bed in the morning \u2013 if only to realise that\nmy parents aren\u2019t wealthy\nenough for me to ever\nget a better bed or indeed\neven aspire to a better bed.\nHowever, it is not for me\nto question the wisdom\nof the class system, as it\ndid spawn the greatest\nEmpire that humanity has\never witnessed, on which\nthe Sun Never Set and\nthe Screaming Never\nStopped. It definitely had\na net positive effect on humanity in general, unless\nof course you count the\npoor bastards that were\nbusy being exploited/\nmurdered/enslaved for the\ngood of the mother coun-try, and, somehow, they\nare conveniently easy to\nignore. It is also critical\nto remember that inequality is only real when we\ntalk about it: the less it\u2019s\nmentioned, the more\nlikely it is that the dumb\nfuckers that make up the\nmodern-day peasantry\nwill continue rutting in the\ndirt without a care in the\nworld. Best to keep it on\nthe low down, otherwise\nthey might do something\nabout it and that would be\ndisastrous. No one wants\nanother 1917.\nAnyway, to return\nfrom my eulogy to those\ngreatest of men and\nwoman that make up\nour ruling aristocracy,\nI have started cycling\nmore, and I have only\none observation to report.\nThe bane of cyclists is\nnot left turning buses or\npedestrians that fail to\nhear you approaching and\nsimply step out into the\nmiddle of the road with\nall the care of a Samurai\ncharging Gatling guns.\nIt is instead people that\ndrive very large cars. For\nsome reason, probably a\nsuperiority complex, these\npeople drive these vessels\nwithout paying attention\nto their surroundings, and\nwhen their surroundings\nrudely intrude on their\nserene progress throughout the cramped streets\nof London, their sole\nresponse is to gesticulate\nviolently, before headbut-ting the horn and volubly\nexclaiming, \u201cget off the\nroad, you wanker.\u201d My\nreasoning for this response\nis that they are not used\nto having to interact\nwith poor people such as\nmyself except when my\nperson is being crushed\nbetween their Land Rover\nwith four-wheel drive\nand some railings. I am\nalmost convinced that\nthe only reason that they\nfail to go through with\ncrushing me to death is\nthat they don\u2019t want to\nhave to clean the blood\noff their car. As a defence\nmechanism, it\u2019s not much,\nbut it certainly beats being\nforced to become some\nsort of human mashed\npotato. In fact, it\u2019s almost\nlike that lizard that squirts\nblood out of their eyes\nto confuse their enemy.\nThat is my final defence\nmechanism: stay away or\nI\u2019ll bleed on you.\nTherefore, I\u2019d like to\noffer some upgrades that\ncould make this defence\nmechanism completely\nobsolete. As far as I\u2019m\naware, there are not very\nmany options, as the\nwhole idea is to minimise\nthe risk of mess. My first\nidea is to attach heated\nBoadicea blades that\nwould instantaneously\ncauterise the wound. Yes,\nit would make the car a\nlittle wider, but I don\u2019t\nthink that has ever been a\nconsideration that has put\nyou off before. Secondly,\nsimilarly to the red flag\nmen that walked in front\nof the car, you could utilise\nsome plebs of your own\nto run alongside and beat\nany unwanted cyclists to\ndeath. Minimise the mess\nto yourself and further the\ncause of the class system\nby setting the Third Estate\nagainst one another.\nWhat\u2019s not to like?\nThis article may not\nreally be about cycling.\nHa ha got you.\nFor some, cycling is a lonely pastime //Flickr\nNew Year, New News!\nFelix are setting up a weekly newsletter, delivered\nstraight to your inbox.

It\u2019s pretty\nstunning in general, but\nfor about six weeks every\nsummer it becomes a\nparticularly breath-taking\nplace to be. Humpback\nwhales are abundant in\nthese waters during that\ntime, and this beach is\nthe perfect spot for land-based whale watching,\nwith humpbacks coming\nwithin ten meters of the\nspectators on the beach.\nThe sea here is teaming\nwith little fish that the\nwhales are feeding on,\nand the odd bigger wave\nwashes a handful of them\nashore \u2013 easiest fish BBQ\never.\nAs I sat there, in awe of\nthese majestic creatures,\nit occurred to me that this\nwas the first time I had\nbeen completely relaxed\nin a good long while. The\nprevious months had been\na crazy frenzy. In preparation for our big trip, my\nwife and I had bought an\nold German fire engine.\nThe week I was trying to\nfinish my PhD (a relatively stressful feat in itself)\nand weekends were spent\ntoiling away on the fire\nengine to build the perfect\ncampervan. Although we\nwere busy seven days a\nweek, there was something incredibly satisfying\nabout swapping the lab for\na real hands-on job with\nguaranteed progress every\nweekend.\nMost of the rest of our\ntime was spent planning\nthe trip, trying to sort out\nthe logistics of shipping\nour van to Canada, and\ninsurance for ourselves\nand the camper. Just two\nweeks before our departure date I passed my viva.\nSomehow we also found\ntime to throw in a surprise\nwedding at our leaving\nparty just ten days before\nour flight to St. John\u2019s,\nNewfoundland (at only\n5.5 hours flight time from\nLondon, this amazing\nlittle town should be on\neveryone\u2019s bucket list!).\nWe\u2019d been planning\nthis trip for a very long\ntime, and we had both\ndreamt about driving the\nPan-American highway\nbefore we\u2019d even met.\nNow it was finally hap-pening! We had shipped\nour old fire truck from\nLiverpool to Halifax on\nthe east coast of Canada.\nFrom there we drove\nacross Canada to the west\ncoast and up to Alaska.\nThe plan is to follow the\nwest coast from there\nuntil, about 18 months\nlater, we hit Ushuaia in\nArgentina, the southernmost city in the world.\nIt\u2019s easy to think you\nunderstand that Canada is\na big country by looking\nat the map, but we\u2019ve\nnow realised that only by\ndriving from one coast to\nthe other can you really\nappreciate just how big\nit really is. We\u2019ve taken\nabout three months to\ndrive coast to coast and\nput about 18,000 extra\nkilometres on the clock\nof our trusty van. In\nbetween, we\u2019ve often\nfelt that we could easily\nspend our entire trip in\nthis amazing country and\nstill wouldn\u2019t be able to\nexplore all its breath-tak-ing wilderness. There are\nsome great cities too, but\nit\u2019s the end-of-the-road\ncommunities and sitting\nby a campfire (many\nlit with pages from my\nthesis, very therapeutic)\nin the middle of nowhere\nin the Yukon that have left\nthe biggest impressions\non us. We\u2019ve met a lot\nof amazing people too,\nand travelling in an old\nfire truck definitely helps.\nIt\u2019s a great conversation\nstarter.\nLate in October, on our\nway south from Alaska\nalong the west coast, we\nhit black ice in northern\nBC and tipped over the\nvan in a ditch. Dream\nover? Unfortunately, the\ndamage to the vehicle was\npretty substantial. We had\ncrashed in the middle of\nnowhere and needed to\nget towed about 700 km\nto the nearest garage that\ncould help. Two months\nlater we\u2019re still waiting\nfor spare parts from\nGermany.\nFed up with the relentless rain in Vancouver,\nwe hired a car to explore\nthe west coast of the USA\nwhilst we\u2019re waiting. The\ntrip must go on! We\u2019re\nvery sad not to be in our\nvan for this part of our\ntrip, but once it\u2019s back on\nthe road, we\u2019ll head down\nto Mexico and pick up\nour trip from there. For\nnow we\u2019re just excited\nto explore some more of\nAmerica\u2019s great National\nParks.\nIf you\u2019re interested to\nfind out whether we\u2019re\nback in our fire truck or\nwant to hear some more\nstories from on the road,\ncheck out @guidiary on\nfacebook and Instagram.\nLooking down on Dawson City from the Dome // Konstantin Holzner\nThe Rocky Mountains, one of the most stunning parts of the trip // Konstantin Holzner\nTravelling the Americas in an old fire engine\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met a\nlot of amazing\npeople too,\nand travelling\nin an old fire\ntruck definitely\nhelps. It\u2019s\na great\nconversation\nstarter\u201d\n\u201cWe could\neasily spend\nour entire trip\nin Canada and\nstill wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to\nexplore all its\nbreath-taking\nwilderness\u201d\n\n"

Segall had\nbeen hinting at an album\nfor a while, dropping numerous promising singles,\nbut nothing could prepare\nus for the project that\nfollowed. The Californian\nmastermind lets\nhis wide range of influences bleed through into\nhis music, allowing a\nmulti-coloured stream of\npunk, rock, psych, folk\nand funk to shine through,\nshowing huge freedom\nin style and utilising the\ndouble album format\nto its full experimental\ncapacity. The result is a\nproject that\u2019s passionately\nfunny, expansive, violent\nand concise all at the same\n\u201cTy Segall is a\ngreat example\nof a true\ngenius who\neffortlessly\nemploys\nthe DIY\nexperimental\nattitude\nassociated\nwith modern\ngarage rock\u201d\nRex\u2019s 1973 LP Tanx.

Ty Segall\u2019s\nwife Den\u00e9e shouts \u201cI see\nfear in freedom!\u201d while\nTy steers the bull around\nthe pen and right out the\nfucking gates. Abruptly,\nthe band slides to the\nother end of the spectrum\nwith \u2018Cry Cry Cry,\u2019 a\nBeatles-esque ballad with\ntropical swinging psychedelic twangs. Freedom\u2019s\nGoblin is truly released\nat this point; the band\u2019s\nguitarists battle doom\nriffs on \u2018She\u2019 and spiral\ninto yet more sax-infused\nmadness, this time going\nfull psychobilly on\n\u2018Talkin 3\u2019. Finally, instead\nof fading out, the band\nthrow down \u2018And, Goodnight\u2019, a sprawling twelve\nminute electrified cover of\ntheir surreal 2013 single\n\u2018Sleeper\u2019. The album had\nalready blown my mind\nand this song serves as the\nperfect head-fuck into a\ncomedown.\nThe album is a symbiotic mix of the beautifully\nmessy and the overpow-eringly crisp, owed to\nthe outstanding nature\nof anything Steve Albini\ntouches. Ty Segall is a\ngreat example of a true\ngenius who effortlessly\nemploys the DIY experimental attitude associated with modern garage\nrock. Despite the album\nspanning 19 songs and\nclocking in at an hour and\nfifteen minutes, Freedom\u2019s\nGoblin doesn\u2019t feel drawn\nout in the slightest, and\nleaves the listener with a\ntaste for more that only\nSegall can satisfy \u2013 and I\nhave no doubt he will.\nI mean, it\u2019s not The Life of Pablo, but for a collage, it still stands out. // Drag City\nMUSIC\nCallum Ritchie\nMusic Writer, @_crill\nArtist: Ty Segall.

Ty comes off as\nmelancholic and contem-plative, sounding almost\nlike Thom Yorke in places\non this track. These songs\nset the tone for the rest of\nthe album as Segall flirts\nwith a whole range of\nemotions and personality\ntraits - which is in part\nwhat makes him such an\ninteresting and relatable\nperformer.\nThe albums then takes\na disco funk detour into a\ncover of Hot Chocolate\u2019s\n1978 track \u2018Every 1\u2019s a\nWinner\u2019. The band act as\ntutors, demonstrating a\nmasterclass in distorted\nfuzz riffs, enlisting the\nhelp of actor and longtime friend Fred Armisen\non percussion. \u2018Despoiler\nof Cadaver\u2019 catches the\nwave and continues riding\nthe bubbling juicy funk\nfor all its worth. The conversation over this song\nis indulgently sexy, weird\nand sinister, in the best\nkind of way possible.\n\u2018When Mommy Kills\nYou\u2019 leaves you chasing\nthe thread of the album\nas chords and distortion\ncontinue to bewilderingly\njump around, never\nleaving you quite enough\ntime to grasp the song,\nwhile the high backing\nvocals taunt you. \u2018My\nLady\u2019s On Fire\u2019 treads on\nsome common ground,\ndrawing influence from\nT. Rex and shows off\nTy\u2019s songwriting skills,\nresulting in an optimistic\nand lively but equally sad\nsong. The melodies of the\nsong get under your skin,\nand the hornlines on top\nblow them throughout,\nscattering and irrevocably\nentwining them with you.\nThis Marc Bolan influence\nis made clearer on \u2018The\nMain Pretender,\u2019 which\nthrows a sax into the mix,\nheavily referencing T.\nBam! // Tony Franois\n\u201cThe album\nis a symbiotic\nmix of the\nmessy and the\ncrisp\u201d\ntime.\n\u2018Fanny Dog\u2019 opens the\nalbum; as heavy layered\nguitar beatings ensue, Ty\nallows his raw vocals to\nlead you through\na goofy song\nabout his\ndog.\nThe\nbrass\nbuilds up\nand adds\nhuge\nweight\nto the\nsong\nbefore\ncrushing\nyou into an\ninterlude.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFRIDAY, 2ND\nFEBRUARY, 2018 FELIX\n8\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nWe are all Hadiza\nWhy the case against Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba is having repercussions throughout the medical community.\nPOLITICS\nTheo Farah\nPolitics Writer\nI\nn the days following\nthe successful appeal\nby the General\nMedical Council\n(GMC) to have Dr Hadiza\nBawa-Garba struck off the\nmedical register, meaning\nshe is not able to return to\npractice for at least five\nyears, a crowd-funding\ncampaign has raised over\n\u00a3200, 000 to fund further\nlegal counsel for the\npaediatrician. The money\nwill be used to pay for independent legal review of\nthe ruling and potentially\na legal challenge to the\nHigh Court decision, as\nwell as the original ruling\nof manslaughter by gross\nnegligence.\nThe swell of support\nfrom doctors across the\nUK was triggered by\nconcerns over patient\nsafety following the ruling\nand perceived scapegoating by Dr Bawa-Garba\u2019s\ntrust and the GMC to\ncover up systemic failings\nin the run up to the tragic\ndeath of six-year-old Jack\nAdcock in February 2011.\nThese concerns were\nshared by health secretary\nJeremy Hunt, who tweeted\nthat he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the potential\nimplications of the ruling.\nWorries were voiced by\nHunt and doctors over the\ndamage done to transparency in medical education\nfollowing the use of Dr\nBawa-Garba\u2019s portfolio\nreflections in the trial,\nwhich were submitted by\nher defence. Thousands\nof doctors have penned\na letter warning of the\npotential consequences,\nsuch as more defensive\nmedicine and less expressive reflection, which\ncould contribute to similar\nmistakes in the future\nand subsequent harm to\npatients.\nJack Adcock was\nadmitted to the Leicester\nRoyal Infirmary Hospital\nat around 10:30am after\nbeing sent there by his\nGP. He presented with\ndehydration secondary to\nvomiting and diarrhoea,\nshallow breathing, and\nblue lips. When admitted\nhe was unresponsive and\nlimp. Initially treated with\nfluids and oxygen, after\na chest x-ray revealed\npneumonia, he was\nprescribed antibiotics.\nJack seemed to recover\ninitially, but at 7.45pm he\nwent into cardiac arrest as\na complication of sepsis,\nwhich had been missed by\nthe medical team. Around\nan hour previously, he\nhad been given an unpre-scribed dose of enalapril,\na regular medication he\nwas prescribed following\nheart surgery in early life.\nJack died 90 minutes later,\nafter resuscitation failed\nto revive him.\nThe original ruling of\ngross negligence manslaughter is grounded\non the failings of Dr\nBawa-Garba having\nhastened the death of\nJack. Several mistakes\nwere made, which were\ngiven in the evidence of\nDr Cadel, expert witness\nof the prosecution and\nwere admitted by Dr Bawa-Garba herself. These\nincluded missing signs\nof sepsis on admission,\nfailing to ask for consultant review by phone or in\nhandover at 4.30pm, and a\nthree hour delay in reading\nthe chest radiograph.\nSeveral key mitigating\nfactors were found to\nhave contributed to the\nday\u2019s events by an internal\ntrust report, yet were not\nincluded in the original\ntrial. The extent of their\ncontribution was such\nthat the report concluded\nthat no single cause for\nthe death was able to be\nidentified. These were\noutlined in an account\nwritten by several consultant paediatricians in\nsupport of Dr Bawa-Garba. They included the fact\nthat she was doing the\nwork of three doctors that\nday, as her consultant and\nthe other registrar were\naway on leave. Due to IT\nfailure, her House Officer\nwas having to phone for\nresults in the afternoon,\nmaking them unable to\nassist in care. In addition,\nthe agency nurse caring\nfor Jack was not trained in\npaediatrics.\nDespite all of this,\nJustice Ouseley, of the\nGMC appeal, ruled that\nthese conditions were not\n\u201csomething she had not\nbeen trained to cope with\nor was something wholly\nout of the ordinary for\na year 6 trainee\u201d. This\nspeaks volumes about the\ncurrent state of the NHS,\nthat a trainee working\nwithout supervision is\nexpected to do the job\nof three doctors without\nmaking any mistakes.\nHence, empathy for Dr\nBawa-Garba is strong,\nwith the hashtag #wea-reallhadiza cropping up\non Twitter. Many doctors\nhave experienced similar\nworking conditions in\ntheir careers, especially\nin recent years within\na buckling, chronically\nunderfunded NHS. Dr\nWilmshurst, Consultant\nCardiologist at Royal\nStoke University Hospital\nhas asked the GMC to\ninvestigate his 40 years of\nclinicalpractice,admitting\nto clinical errors leading\nto delayed diagnosis and\ntreatment. Writing to the\nBMJ, he stated \u201cit is clear\nthat the High Court agreed\nwith the GMC that honest\nerrors should be career\nending mistakes\u201d.\nThe tremors from the\ncase have reached medical\nstudents here at Imperial,\nwho fear what the decision\nof the GMC means for\ntheir training. One student\ncommented that they are\n\u201cterrified\u201d that doctors are\nexpected to cope without\nadequate resources and\nnot only do one job, but\nthat of two other doctors.\nAnother said that they are\n\u201chesitant\u201d to engage with\nthe reflective process for\nlearning purposes if it\ncan be used as evidence\nagainst them. Perhaps\nmost worrying is the\nGMC\u2019s move to strike Dr\nBawa-Garba off, despite\nthe previous ruling of\nthe Medical Practitioners\nTribunal to suspend her\nfor 12 months. Supposedly this was done in the\npublic interest, to restore\nconfidence in the profes-sion. To many, however,\nthe decision seems to be an\nact of political and public\nappeasement, and will do\nnothing to prevent similar\ndeaths in the future.\nDr Bawa-Garba\u2019s trial has serious implications for the medical industry in the UK // CC\n\n"

It\u2019s a\ntraditional form of dance\nwhere you dance in either\na pair or small group with\na \u201ccaller\u201d on the stage\ntelling you how to do\nthe moves. You\u2019ll start\noff slow, with the music\ngetting faster and faster\nand everyone getting very\nsweaty! There\u2019s always\na real mix of abilities,\nbut the dances are easy\nenough that even if you\nhave two left feet you\ncan easily follow. And\neven if you do mess up,\nso many other people will\nalso be making mistakes\nthat it won\u2019t even matter.\nBesides, most of the time\nyou\u2019re fairly tipsy (or\nvery tipsy if you have\nan alcohol tolerance like\nmine) from going to the\npub beforehand or visiting\nthe bar downstairs for\nsustenance, and most of\nthe other dancers will be\nthe same, so no one cares\nif you mess up \u2013 really,\nwe recommend a bit of\nfreestyling.\nFor those of you who\ndon\u2019t know, this fun event\nis found in both Irish and\nScottish traditions, with\nthe Irish spelling c\u00e9il\u00ed and\nthe Scots ceilidh. Technically speaking the one\nin Camden is a Scottish\nversion with kilts and free\nshortbread at the end, but\nthe actual dancing and\nmusic is pretty much the\nsame. And who doesn\u2019t\nwant free shortbread?\nAdmittedly, most\nstudents aren\u2019t initially\nexcited at the prospect of\nattending a folk dancing\nevent. Which is fair\nenough \u2013 many of our\nmembers who had never\nbeen to a ceilidh before\nwere incredibly sceptical\nand took a lot of convincing to attend our first\nceilidh last term. But all of\nthose who were uncertain\nyet still came to our first\none, were among the first\nto buy tickets when we\nwent again this second\ntime \u2013 and I think that\nspeaks for itself!\nIf you\u2019re currently\nfeeling sad because\nyou\u2019ve missed out on such\nan amazing event \u2013 there\u2019s\nno need to worry, because\nIrish Society will be going\nto another ceilidh soon!\nAll the details are on our\nFacebook page, and next\ntime we\u2019ll be going to one\nin South Kensington. To\nadd to all this excitement,\nit will also be St Patrick\u2019s\nDay so this is an extra\nexcuse to join us for drinks\nand dancing. Everyone is\nwelcome to come along,\nwhether you\u2019re Irish,\nScottish, or just looking\nto have a great night!\n(But seriously, half of our\nmembers aren\u2019t even Irish\nat all.)\nEmily Daborn\nKINKY KLUB \u2013\nIMPERIAL\u2019S NEWEST\nCSP\n\u00a7\nWith more than 350\nstudent clubs at Imperial,\nit might seem that there\naren\u2019t any interests not\ncatered to by a CSP. This\nisn\u2019t the case, however,\nand each year sees the\ncreation of a number of\nclubs, driven by passionate individuals who\nguide their club from\nconception to fruition.\nOne of the newest clubs\nto be placed in the New\nActivities Incubator is\nKinky Klub, described\nas \u201ca non-judgemental\nplace where you can ask\nquestions about the kinky\nworld we live in\u201d. We sat\ndown with Chair Alexandra Dakin to chat about\nthe story behind Kinky\nKlub, and its increasing\npopularity on campus:\nWhat was the driving\nmotivation behind\nthe creation of Kinky\nKlub?\nWell I am a very open\nperson by nature, so\ntalking about sex comes\nvery naturally to me. But\nlately I came to realise\nthat there isn\u2019t a place\nwhere people can go and\nask questions about what\ngoes on behind closed\ndoors in a safe environ-ment. I have found that\nonce you start talking to\nsomeone about what they\nlike and what they dislike\nthe conversation becomes\neasy very quickly \u2013 it\u2019s\njust about getting over\nthat first hurdle of embarrassment or shyness. So I\ndecided to create a society\nwhere that first hurdle\nno longer exists \u2013 where\npeople can express themselves freely without the\nfear of judgement.\nHow have you found\nthe process of creating the club? Was it\nan easy journey, or\ndid you feel you had\nto justify yourself\nquite a lot?\nThe waiting period after\nsending in the application\nwas quite long, and things\nseemed to keep getting\npushed back. I honestly\nnever thought the Union\nwould allow it in the\nfirst place but when the\nsecond stage came around\nthe only thing they were\nconcerned about was how\nmuch money the society\nmight make! They never\nasked for any special\njustification \u2013 in fact they\ngot excited by it!\nWhat are the main activities of Kinky Klub\ngoing to be this year?\nWell our first big\nevent will be a Sex Shop\nCrawl around Soho. We\nalso want to get speakers\nin to do talks, as well as\nintroducing people to the\nalternative nightlife of\nLondon. I have also had\nmany requests to do a\nkinky tour to Amsterdam,\nso hopefully that will go\nahead too.\nWhat do you think\nthe main challenges will be for Kinky\nKlub?\nThe main challenge\nI think will be to not get\na name for ourselves as\nbeing the \u2018orgy club\u2019 \u2013\nobviously if people want\nto have an orgy that\u2019s up\nto them but that\u2019s not what\nour society is exclusively\nfor. I can give you tips for\nsure, but I ain\u2019t organising\none!\nYou\u2019ve already got\nover 70 members \u2013\nare you surprised at\nthe Klub\u2019s popularity?\nI have to say I was\nreally surprised by the\nsupport the society\nreceived from the get go.\nI thought I would at least\nhit a little bit of resistance,\nas nothing like this has\never been done at Imperial\nbefore, but instead people\nhave been so excited by\nour societies creation.\nIt just goes to show that\neveryone is a little kinky\non the inside!\nTom Bacarese-Hamilton, Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), told\nFelix: We\u2019re an inclusive\ncommunity at the Union,\nwe have all kinds of different student groups and\nwe\u2019re happy to support\nstudents to explore their\ninterests. We look forward\nto reading their risk\nassessment, and helping\nthem have an impact on\nthe student body.\u201d\nIrish Soc having a ball \u2013 make sure to catch their next ceilidh/c\u00e9ili soon! // Irish Society\nENVIRONMENTAL\nSOCIETY \u2013 IT\u2019S EASY\nBEE-ING GREEN\nBeing Green should be\nsomething you strive to\ndo all year round, but if\nyou don\u2019t know how then\nImperial\u2019s Green Week is\na good place to start! The\nEnvironmental Society\nhas an exciting calendar of\nactivities planned from the\n12th\nto the 18th\nof February\naiming to inform and help\nyou to lead a more sustainable lifestyle. With bike\nworkshops, vegan food\ntastings, clothes swaps,\nand film screenings you\u2019ll\nbe sure to find something\nto do.\nOn Monday and\nThursday we\u2019ll be running\nbike repair workshops\nso you can fix your bike\n(for free!) and also learn\nhow to do it yourself. If\npainting is your thing,\nwe\u2019re also organising\nan art workshop with\nLeoSoc. Tuesday will see\na film screening of Black\nIce about Greenpeace\nactivists protesting the\nfirst-ever oil drilling in the\nArctic Ocean. In addition\nto having members of\nGreenpeace joining us on\nthe evening, we are extremely lucky to have one\nof the Arctic 30 with us\nto answer your questions\nfollowing the film!\nOn Wednesday there\nwill be a Marine Conservation Society information stall during the day\nfollowed by a film screening of Chasing Corals, in\nthe evening.\nOn Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday we\u2019ll\nbe running various\nworkshops in our Secret\nGarden.

Our campaign\nChasing Corals is inspired\nby the film of the same\nname and encourages\npeople to reduce their\nplastic consumption to\navoid it going into our\noceans.\nMany people associate\nbeing green with being\nvegetarian or vegan, and\nfor good reason: animal\nhusbandry has significant\ndetrimental impacts to\nthe environment. Our\nLess Meat Less Methane\ncampaign teaches people\nabout these by organising\na Less Meat Awareness\nweek and petitioning\nthe Union for Meat Free\nMondays. We also run a\nFood Co-op where you\ncan buy locally sourced\nfood with little markup.\nIn short, there\u2019s a lots of\nways of getting involved\nwith us and helping to\nmake Imperial a university you can be proud of\nhaving attended!\nYou can find the\nFacebook page for the\nGreen Week at www.\nfacebook.com/Imperi-algreenweek/.

The\npublication \u2013 entitled The\nBallot or the Bullet: Why\nthe best thing we can do\nfor democracy is destroy\nit \u2013 argued that student\ndemand for democracy\nwould only increase if\nelections were banned.\nProfessor Mark\nMcGrath, Chair of\nEuropean History at the\nUniversity of Leicester,\nwas the lead author of the\nstudy. He told Hangman:\n\u201cIn putting together the\nreport, we did a great deal\nof research into students.\nWe found a clear pattern\nof behaviour: students\nwould never use a service\nthat was on offer, but as\nsoon as you decided to\nwithdraw it, they\u2019d all\nsuddenly start bitching.\nWe therefore felt that\nbanning student elections\nwould mean everyone\nwould suddenly pay\nattention to them\u201d.\nHedwig Grantly, Imperial College Union\u2019s\n\u2018Deeper Democracy\nDeliverer\u201d, told Hangman\nBy banning democratic\nengagement, we believe\nstudents will suddenly\nstart demanding the right\nto vote.\u201d\n\u201cAlready this morning\nwe\u2019ve been inundated\nwith complaints from\nUnion Council members,\nwho say we\u2019re undermining the fundamental\nprinciples of student\ndemocracy. Once this\noutrage trickles down to\nthe students at large, and\nriots break out in Metric,\nwe\u2019ll reopen nominations\nand watch them flock to\nthe ballot box.\u201d\nThe move has already\nprovoked a fierce reaction\nfrom students. Julius\nPutnam, a final year chemistry undergraduate, told\nHangman: \u201cI\u2019ve never\nreally cared about the\nUnion, and I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ve actually ever voted\nin previous elections.\nBut not they\u2019re trying to\nremove something I don\u2019t\neven use I\u2019m going to fight\nto the death until elections\n\u201cThat\u2019s over. It\u2019s cancelled\u201d// Imperial College/ICU\nat this clear trampling of\ndemocratic rights,\u201d she\ntold Hangman, \u201cwe\u2019re\ngoing to use every tool at\nour disposal to reverse the\ndecision. We\u2019ll even start\na change.org petition if we\nhave to\u201d\nHangman expected the\ndecision to be welcomed\nby members of FashSoc,\nbut one of their representatives told us \u201cfor the\nlast time, we\u2019re fashion\nsociety, not the alt-right.\u201d\nOther students seemed\nless affected by the de-cision, however: when\nHangman spoke to students in the College Cafe\nabout the move, who said\n\u201cwhat\u2019s the Union? Is it\nthe same as the College?\u201d,\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what a\nDPFS is\u201d, and \u201cplease\nleave me alone.\u201d\n\u201cAs Joni\nMitchell\nteaches us, you\ndon\u2019t know\nwhat you\u2019ve\ngot\u2018til it\u2019s\ngone\u201d\nare reinstated.\u201d\nLouise Prufrock,\nhead of Imperial Labour\nSociety, called the move\nan \u201coutrage for democracy\u201d. \u201cAs a student political\ngroup, we are in disbelief\n\u201cStudents have\nthreatened to\nstart a change.\norg petition if\nthe elections\nare not\nreinstated\u201d\nthat the move, though\n\u201cbold\u201d, would \u201censure a\ngreater participation than\never\u201d: \u201cIf Joni Mitchell\nhas taught us anything, it\u2019s\nthat you don\u2019t know what\nyou\u2019ve got \u2018til it\u2019s gone.\nARIES TAURUS GEMINI CANCER LEO VIRGO\nLIBRA SCORPIO SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN AQUARIUS PISCES\nThis week you\u2019re Ipsos\nMORI, and for the love\nof God just leave me\nalone I\u2019m not going to fill\nout the fucking NSS.\n43\nISSUE 15\nFELIX\nHANGMAN negafelix@imperial.ac.uk\nHANGMAN\nThe staff members\nwith the greatest\nnumber of SACAs\nnominations will get\nto keep their pensions\nNegafelix\nEditor-in-Chief\nS\ntaff members\nwith the most\nnominations in\nthe Student Academic Choice Awards\n(SACAs) will see their\npensions reinstated, in\nthe latest development\nover staff pensions.\nAcademic staff up and\ndown the country are set\nto go on strike later this\nmonth and in March,\nfollowing disputes about\npension pay. Following\ndeadlocked talks between\nthe trade unions and senior\nCollege management last\nweek, Imperial College\nUnion have been working\nwith the College to try and\ncome up with a solution.\nEarlier this week,\nKyle Fandergoose, Vice\nProvost (Scab Employment), announced the\nchanges. In an email sent\nout to all Imperial staff,\nFandergoose said that\nthe changes were \u201ca fair\nsolution to the drawn out\nnegotiations\u201d. He told\nHangman: \u201cat Imperial,\nwe pride ourselves on\nworld-class research and\ncutting edge technological\ndevelopments. However,\nas a staff member pointed\nout to me the other day,\nwe\u2019ve also got students\nwho need teaching. I don\u2019t\nknow if this is a new thing\nor not\u2026 nevertheless,\nthis new method means\nthat some staff will get to\nkeep their pensions, while\nthose who students don\u2019t\nlike or know will bear the\nbrunt of costs. It seems\nvery fair.\u201d\nNeil Babcock, the\nUnion\u2019s Deputy President (Edutainment), told\nHangman \u201cfor the past\nhalf-decade we\u2019ve been\ngiving out our famous\nmugs to those who are\nnominated for SACAs \u2013\nso well known now that\nthey\u2019re almost an Imperial institution. This year,\nhowever, we wanted to\ndo a bit more to recognise\nour wonderful staff \u2013 as\nwell as a mug, those who\nreceive the most nominations will also have the\nadded benefit of a sense of\nfinancial security post-retirement.\u201d\nOne staff member was\nunhappy with the changes,\ntelling Hangman: \u201cit\u2019s bad\nenough that I have to deal\nwith students complaining\nabout their late feedback\nand unclear marking guid-ance, but now I have to\nbe actively nice to them?\nScrew that.\u201d Other reactions ranged from \u201cstudents, what students?\u201d to\n\u201cwait, I\u2019ve been supposed\nto be teaching?\u201d\nSome staff seemed\nhappy with the changes,\nhowever. Dr Jess Syntess,\nfrom the Department of\nMaterials, told Hangman:\n\u201cthese changes make\nperfect sense. It\u2019s about\ntime we recognised how\ncentral teaching is to our\nroles, and how much\nwe enjoy spending time\nwith our students. I really\nvalue all my wonderful\nstudents, and hope they\u2019re\nreading this. If any of\nthem wanted to make a\nSACAs nomination for\nme, it only take a couple\nof minutes. Please.

Despite a close\nmatch in epee and a win\nin sabre, their strong foil\nteam managed to swing\nthe match to an overall\nwin.\nThat loss motivated\nus to work even harder\nin the next match against\nCambridge. Guilia\nMandelli managed to\nsecure the final point in a\nhard fought foil match to\nsecure a win of 45-44, and\ndespite a close loss in the\nepee, Niamh Spence led\nthe sabre team to a large\nlead win, resulting in a\ncomfortable victory over\nCambridge\nThe last match on\nSaturday extending into\nour 9th\ncontinuous hour\nof fencing was against\nBristol.

Our\nleague consisted of\nOxford 1s, Cambridge\n1s, UCL 1s, Bristol 1s,\nand us. Our first match of\nthe weekend was against\nUCL, a match we needed\nto win if we were to avoid\nbeing in the relegation\nspot. Firstly, our incredibly strong foil team\nanchored by Guillermo\nDelberque carried us to an\neasy lead of 45-24. This\nwas followed by UCL\nwinning epee by a single\npoint but an exceptional\nperformance by Matei\nGrama lead the team to a\nwin overall. Imperial 128\n\u2013 UCL 114.\nOur next match was\nagainst Cambridge. Just\nas we were about to start,\nan old injury of James\nOdger\u2019s, our strongest\nepeeist, put him out of the\nmatch. We persevered,\nachieving a close win in\nepee, and a close loss in\nfoil. In the final round of\nsabre, we were cursed\nwith injury again when\nChris Erickson suffered a\nhand injury that rendered\nhim unable to fence, and\nwith no substitute avail-able, we conceded the\nbout. Two injuries making\nwhat could\u2019ve been a\ndecisive win into a very\nclose defeat. Imperial 120\n- Cambridge 125.\nOur final match of the\nSaturday was against\nBristol. We began with\nfoil again, with the skill of\nour foil team giving us a 7\npoint lead going into epee.\nWith Guillermo filling in\nfor James, we struggled\nagainst an experienced\nteam, losing epee. Despite\nan incredible performance\nfrom Guillermo filling in\nfor Chris this time, sabre\nwas no better. Imperial\n103 - Bristol 128.\nWe all arrived Sunday\nmorning refreshed and\nhopeful. We had only one\nmatch against Oxford,\nand we were confident we\ncould win, despite being\n3 fencers short of our full\nteam. We began with foil,\nand a strong showing from\nall fencers: we foil with a\n5 point lead. Sabre was\nnext, where we pulled it\nback and closed the gap to\n10 points. The final match\nof foil was close the entire\nway through, interrupted\nonly briefly by one of\nOxford fencers ripping\nhis mask off to throw up.\nWe entered the final bout\nleading 40-37 and needed\nto get to 45 before they\nget to 41. It now all lies on\nFilip Anies who takes it\nto an excruciatingly close\n44-40 but just missed the\ncrucial last point. The\nfinal score: Imperial 125 -Oxford 127.\nWe finished 5th\nin the\nleague, ahead of UCL,\nand considering the\ninjuries we faced and the\nfencers we were missing,\nwe are incredibly proud\nof our performance.

Despite this\nbeing a friendly match,\nintended to be just a warm\nup for the competitive\none we had planned for\nthe Saturday, we were\nfaced by Lisbon\u2019s finest\nwater polo players.

As the social\nmembers played our first\nteam trained on the other\nend of the pool.\nAfter training we\nventured back to our\nhostel, where we greeted\nby some lovely staff\nwho gave us pizza and\nsangria which was much\nneeded! We then ventured\nas a team to the bars as a\nteam social in exploring\nsome of Lisbon\u2019s famous\nnightlife.\nThe team awoke on the\nSaturday excited to play,\nthe hostel provided a large\ncomplimentary breakfast\nand our first team took the\nopportunity to carb load.\nWe then had a few hours\nbefore we needed to travel\nback to the pool. Many\nmembers of the team took\nthe opportunity to go for a\nshort walk and explore the\nlocal area, while others\nnapped and prepared for\nthe game.\nThe game commenced\nshortly after 1pm and\nwe played in running\nquarters. Despite a strong\nlead of 2-0 in the first five\nminutes of the game we\nsoon realised our team\nwas exhausting quickly\nand that subbing in and\nout was crucial to ensure\nour team didn\u2019t tire too\nmuch. Despite the change\nin tactics by the end of the\nfirst quarter the score was\na draw at 2-2.\nA quick team chat in\nbetween quarters about\nsubbing tactics and\nensuring we swum back\nquickly when the ball\nchanged hands helped to\nchange the game around\nfor a minute or two as we\nscored and were playing\nwell; however the Lisbon\nteam were strong and\nwere putting up a good\nfight so by the halfway\nmark the game had turned\naround with a score of 7-3\nto Lisbon.\nThe social team from\nthe sidelines begun to\ncheer, and their support\nkept the morale high. One\nof our alumni, Laurence\nSuckling, then made a\nsurprise appearance in the\nviewing area and we knew\nwe then had to give our\nbest and not lose hope.\nThe first few minutes\nof the third quarter\nwere uneventful with\nneither team scoring or\nconceding. Then in our\npossession Laurence\nbegun to chant \u201cLeo..\nLeo\u201d and Leo, spurred on\nby the support, swum up\nand was passed the ball,\nmaking an amazing goal\nto win title of man of the\nmatch. The excitement\nwas short lived as we\nfinished the quarter with\na score of 10-4 to Lisbon.\nThe final quarter we\nwere determined to put\nup a strong fight and we\nplayed strong until the\nend. Even though the final\nscore was 15-9 to Lisbon\nwe ended the game in\nhigh spirits as we knew\nwe had played really well\nagainst a very strong and\nprepared team.\nFollowing a photo the\nsocial team were keen to\njump in and play from\nwhere we left off the\nprevious day; the first\nteams were exhausted\nand keen to shower for\nour evening social with\nLisbon.\nLater that evening we\nmet the Lisbon team at\na restaurant where we\nenjoyed a three course\nmeal and wine with the\nteam. We discussed water-polo \u2013 and of course less\nserious matters \u2013 before\nheading back to the bars\nwith Lisbon\u2019s team as our\nguide. We returned in the\nearly hours and enjoyed a\nlong and much needed lie\nin on the Sunday.\nOn Sunday we had\noriginally planned some\nland-based training.\nHowever as many of our\nteam were feeling worse\nfor wear we decided to do\na long walk as a team and\nstretch out our muscles\nfrom the previous days.\nWe walked from the\nhostel to Lisbon\u2019s famous\nOceanarium.\nIn the evening we\nhad planned a team\nbonding activity \u2013 Bubble\nFootball!\nThis was really fun and\na great opportunity for our\nsocial team and our firsts\nteam to bond and play in\nmixed groups. It involved\nus playing football while\nin a Zorbing ball. It was\nincredibly tiring and definitely compensated for\nour failed gym set in the\nmorning.\nOn Monday morning,\nwe packed up and got\nprepared to leave. We\ntravelled to the Lisbon\nTime Out market and\nenjoyed a large meal\ntogether where we could\ndiscuss the events of tour\n\u2013 the biggest tour we have\never been on, and our\nmost successful to date!\nICSMWP hit the pool // ICSMWP\nICSMWP looking fly on the short // ICSMWP\nWomen\u2019s 1st Team Fencing come second in the Southern Premier League winning four out of five matches .\nFencey McFenceFence // ICU Fencing\n\n"

One\nparticular category has\ncontinued to be the source\nof much debate throughout awards season, with\ncommentators and voters\nalike unable to come to\nagreement. Across the\nGolden Globes, BAFTAs,\nand Academy Awards\nthis year we have had ten\ndifferent people nominated for Best Director,\nan unprecedented total,\nand a somewhat welcome\nchange from seeing\nthe same five directors\ncompete from January\nto March. In the end we\nwound up with four first\ntime nominees, including\ntwo making their directorial debuts, joined by a\nman who has been widely\nlauded as our greatest\nworking director.\nThere has been\nmounting pressure on the\nAcademy in recent years\nto reward a more diverse\nrange of performers and\nartists. Suggestions that\nthe largely older, white,\nmale voting pool lean\ntowards voting for films\nmade by their peers have\ncaused the Academy\nto take measures to\ndrastically alter the demographics of its voters,\nincreasing the number\nof women and ethnic\nminorities, and lowering\nthe average age. 683 new\nmembers were invited to\njoin the Academy in 2016.\nPrior to this, the voting\nmembership was by the\nAcademy\u2019s own count\n94% white and 76% male.\nAfter, it is 89% white and\n73% male. While still a\nfar cry from equality, the\nshake-up was a step in the\nright direction. This has\nundoubtedly influenced\nthis year\u2019s nominations,\nwith older stalwarts\nRidley Scott and Steven\nSpielberg \u2013 who received\nGolden Globe nods \u2013 shut\nout for the younger Greta\nGerwig and Jordan Peele,\nboth making films from\nperspectives that are not\nseen nearly enough on the\nbig screen. There is still\na huge amount of work\nthat needs to be done to\nensure that studios, production companies, and\nindependent financiers\ninvest more in women\nand ethnic minority filmmakers (only 11% of films\nin 2017 were directed by\nwomen, a figure that has\nnot increased since 2000),\nbut this is a start.\nCall me old-fashioned\nthough, but I for one\nwould like to see the\nactual five best directorial\nefforts of the past year\nbe nominated in the\nfive Best Director slots.\nCrazy thought: maybe the\ncategory should do what it\nsays on the tin. Of course,\nthe Academy is allergic to\nlower budget, avant garde\nfair, and has consistently\ndisplayed a quality akin\nto xenophobia in its unswerving exclusion of for-eign-language directors\nfrom the race. The likes\nof Sean Baker and Shane\nCarruth will likely never\ncome close to Academy\nrecognition, nor David\nLowery for last year\u2019s astonishing A Ghost Story;\nmeanwhile, the Michel\nHazanavicius\u2019s and\nMichael Hanekes of this\nworld come once in a blue\nmoon. Even if we accept\nthese limitations, the\ninclusion of Gerwig and\nPeele is still somewhat\ncontentious. Were they\nreally part of the best five\nEnglish-language mainstream film directors last\nyear?\nToanswerthatquestion,\nwe need to really think\nabout what it means to\ndirect a film. At a basic\nlevel, we can go with\nDavid Mamet\u2019s definition:\nthe director has two main\nduties \u2013 to know where\nto put the camera, and to\ncommunicate with the\nactors. This is rudimenta-ry, and does not encompass the auteur theory of\ncinema, of which each of\nthis year\u2019s five nominees\nis an exponent, with all\nof them serving as writ-er-director-producers (bar\nGerwig, who is merely a\nwriter-director). However,\nto assess this year\u2019s candidates for arguably the\nmost prestigious prize in\ncinema, let us go along\nwith Mamet\u2019s ideology.\nFirst up, Guillermo Del\nToro. Though never nominated for Best Director\nbefore, he won the Golden\nGlobe and Critics Choice\nAward, and is widely\nexpected to follow this\nup with victories at the\nBAFTAs and Oscars. Del\nToro\u2019s career has largely\nbeen focused on stories\nabout mythical beasts,\nand he has a knack for\ntying in these narratives\nwith important periods in\nhistory. On this occasion\nhe weaves a romance\nbetween a mute janitor\nand a merman-like\naquatic creature from the\nAmazon with the masculine toxicity of the Cold\nWar. Del Toro\u2019s work is\njaw-dropping, particularly\nthe beautiful underwater\nshots and a wonderful\nblack and white musical\nsegment that harks back\nto the Classic Hollywood\nera. There is more than\na little Douglas Sirk in\nthis picture, and Sally\nHawkins\u2019 is mesmeric in\nthe lead, ably supported\nby Octavia Spencer,\nRichard Jenkins, Michael\nShannon, Michael\nStuhlbarg, and Doug\nJones in heavy suiting\nand make-up. Does he\nknow where to put the\ncamera? Check. Does he\nget great performances\nout of his actors? Check.\nIf as expected Del Toro is\nvictorious, he will be the\nfourth Mexican winner\nin the past five years.\nOther directors would be\nwishing Trump\u2019s wall had\nbeen erected a few years\nago.\ngiving two of the best\nperformances of the\nyear. In that respect she\ncertainly fulfils her duty\nas a director assuredly. On\nthe other hand, one has to\nquestion whether her task\nin directing Lady Bird\nwas really as difficult as\nthe grand scale of Denis\nVilleneuve\u2019s triumph\nwith Blade Runner 2049,\nor whether her choice of\nshots had anywhere near\nthe subtext of Luca Guadagnino\u2019s sensual Call Me\nby Your Name. Gerwig\npasses the test with Lady\nBird, but her test is like\nKey Stage 1 mathematics\ncompared to the University level work Villeneuve\nand Guadagnino have\nattempted and pulled off.\nThere is no doubt that\nGerwig is riding a wave\nof momentum with the\n#MeToo and Time\u2019s Up\nmovements. It is insensitive to compare the suppression of female directors to the sexual violence\nagainst women that has\nled to these uprisings, and\nyet that is exactly what\nhas happened. Society\nis rightly demanding\nwomen be treated fairly\nand equally in all aspects\nof life, but this may have\npushed Gerwig into a\nposition she does not\nnecessarily deserve over\nothers. The strength of\nher film is in the honesty\nof its script, and while her\ndirection is adequate, it is\nnot comparable to some of\nthe others who have been\nleft out.\nGet Out was a gargantuan financial hit. Jordan\nPeele\u2019s social commentary certainly seemed to\nalign with the current zeit-geist, and while initially\nwell reviewed \u2013 but not\nacclaimed to the extent\nof the likes of Dunkirk,\nCall Me by Your Name,\nThe Florida Project, or\nPhantom Thread \u2013 it has\nsince gone on to top more\nyear end lists than any\nother film. Peele draws\ndecent performances from\nyoung talents like Daniel\nKaluuya, Lakeith Stanfield, and Caleb Landry\nJones, and the always excellent Catherine Keener\nand Bradley Whitford.\nHowever, Allison\nWilliams is simply dire,\nand Lil Rel Howery\u2019s\nmoments are jarring, and\nnot in a good way. This\nis surely Peele casting a\nthrowback to his sketch\nshow acting days, and not\na particularly welcome\none. Comparison with\nThe Killing of a Sacred\nDeer is useful, as Yorgos\nLanthimos\u2019 ability to\ncreate suspense through\nmotivated and careful\ncamera movement and a\nstaccato score is far more\neffective than anything\nPeele is able to conjure\nup, evidencing Peele\u2019s\ndirectorial shortcomings.\nPeele\u2019s concept, particularly that of the sunken\nplace, is insightful, but\nagain, like Gerwig, one\ncannot help but feel that\nthe strength of this film\nis in the script (which\narguably comes loose in\nthe third act anyway) and\nnot in the direction. Still,\nPeele becomes only the\nfifth black person nominated for Best Director,\nfollowing recent nominations for Barry Jenkins\nand Steve McQueen. One\nwould be hard pressed\nto find anyone that considers Peele\u2019s directorial\nachievements on a par\nwith the elegiac lyricism\nof Jenkins or the gritty expressionism of McQueen.\nSteven Spielberg.\nJames Cameron. Quentin\nTarantino. There are but\na handful of directors\nwho have been able to\ntransform themselves into\na brand, but Christopher\nNolan can surely count\nhimself in this elite\ncompany. Considering the\npopularity of the likes of\nInception and The Dark\nKnight, it will have been\nof surprise to many to\nlearn that Dunkirk was in\nfact Nolan\u2019s first Oscar\nnomination for Best\nDirector. In reality, this\nis the first time Nolan has\nreally deserved it. Dunkirk\nis his best film, playing to\nhis strengths while cutting\nout his tortured leading\nmen with dying wives and\ncringe-worthy dialogue.\nNolan has stripped down\ncinema to its foundations\n\u2013 sight and sound \u2013 and\npushed those elements to\nthe limit. Dunkirk does\nfalter in the sense that\nthe emotional beats, such\nas the death of Barry Keoghan\u2019s young volunteer\nGeorge Mills and the\ncapture of Tom Hardy\u2019s\nspitfire pilot Farrier, do\nnot truly resonate. Undeniably though, Nolan\ndelivered cinema in its\npurest form, and deserved\nhis nod for Best Director.\nBergman, Scorsese, and\nKubrick, superb scores,\nbeautiful cinematography,\nrichly unique characters,\nand tremendous acting\nperformances are all\nhallmarks of Anderson\u2019s\nwork, particularly as he\nhas matured and moved\ninto a more refined\nand less wild mode of\nfilmmaking. Perhaps the\nthree greatest male acting\nperformances of the\ncentury came in Anderson\nfilms \u2013 Daniel Day-Lewis\nin There Will Be Blood\nand Joaquin Phoenix and\nPhillip Seymour Hoffman\nin The Master. This highlights his extraordinary\nabilities as a director, and,\nalongside his sumptuous-ly framed shots (which\nhe composed entirely on\nhis own this time round,\nserving as his own cine-matographer), showcase\nhim as the finest filmmaker of his generation.\nPhantom Thread is not\nanother step on the ladder\nto greatness for Paul\nThomas Anderson; he has\nalready long resided in the\npantheon of the greats.\nIt may be controversial\nto suggest that Gerwig and\nPeele have received their\nnominations on the basis\nof politics, but it certainly\nseems to be the case that\ntheir inclusion has been\ndriven by the desire to\ninclude more women and\nethnic minorities, especially when their work is\nstacked up against that of\nDel Toro, Anderson and\nNolan. Their nominations\nhave certainly caused\ndebate, and prompted\nquestions on how we\nshould judge the quality\nof directing. At this year\u2019s\nOscars, many of the Best\nPicture nominees will also\nbe competing in other cat-egories. Were films akin to\nmathematical equations,\nonce one removes the\nacting, writing, and technical elements of the film,\nthen Best Picture should\nequal Best Director. Sadly\nthat is not the case, and\nit is incredibly hard to\nseparate the director from\nthe rest of the production,\nmore so than any other\ncategory. Filmmaking is\nthe most collaborative of\nprocesses, and the lines\nbetween individual disciplines are so often blurred.\nIt is the director\u2019s job to\nbring all these elements\ntogether into a cohesive\nvision. When they all do\ncome together it can yield\nspectacular results. That\nis what good directing\nis, and that is what good\nfilmmaking is.\nThat framing, tho // Focus\nDel Toro\u2019s beauty-drenched shots // Fox Searchlight\n\u201cThere is more\nthan a little\nDouglas Sirk\nin Guillermo\nDel Toro\u2019s\nThe Shape of\nWater\u201d\nGreta Gerwig is one of\nthe most versatile actors\nof her generation, and has\nshown herself to be a dab\nhand as a writer, co-pen-ning Frances Ha and\nMistress America.

Despite my reser-vations, I was pleasantly\nsurprised by how much\nI enjoyed it. For starters,\nI could understand what\nthey were saying \u2013 traditional Chinese opera\nis often sung in a shrill\ndialect, which is difficult\nfor the untrained ear to\nfully make out.\nThe Handan Dream\nwas written by Tang\nXianzu, a poet and dramatist in the later years of the\nMing Dynasty in China.\nAlthough separated by\ngeography and culture,\nTang and Shakespeare\nhappened to live at the\nsame time, and even\ndied in the same year,\n1616. Both playwrights\nproduced work that\nexplored the timeless\naspects of human nature\n\u2013 expressions of life that\ntranscended time and\nspace. It is no wonder that\nboth thus left significant\nlegacies in their respective\ncultures.\nThe \u2018Handan Road\u2019\nrefers to the road en route\nto the state exams, which\npasses through the city of\nHandan. Over the years it\nhas acquired a metaphorical meaning, referring\nto the journey one takes\nto officialdom. In ancient\nChina, an intellectual\u2019s\nforemost goal is to study\nhard, pass these official\nexams, and become an\nofficial.\nThe Handan Dream\nfollows the protagonist\nLu, an intellectual who\nhas spent his whole life\nstudying the classical\nworks with the aim of\nwalking the Handan road\nand passing the state\nexams with flying colours.\nHowever, we see him on\nhis fourth journey, after\nhaving failed the exam\nthree times before. On the\nway, he stops by an inn\nwhere a Taoist priest gives\nhim a magic pillow, on\nwhich he falls asleep while\nwaiting for his millet meal\nto cook. Lu is whisked\ninto a parallel life where\nhe meets and marries a\nlady of wealth, bribes\nthe officials and passes\nthe exams. He becomes a\ndecorated official only to\nfall into the traps of fame\nand wealth, and after a\nlife of ups and downs he\nsettles to celebrate his 80th\nbirthday \u2013 only to wake\nup from the dream.\nThe Taoist priest\nsuggests that perhaps this\nvision of an \u2018ideal\u2019 life is\ntrapping his reality, and\nthat perhaps, happiness is\nwithin reach as long as Lu\ncan let this vision go, as in\na dream. Lu refuses, and\nkeeps the magic pillow,\npreferring instead to live\nhis dream.\nThe central idea of\nthis play can be summed\nup in the Taoist priest\u2019s\npoetic verse: \u201cI look back,\nsmile and pass Handan\nwithout a rest\u201d. This idea\nof \u2018looking back with a\nsmile\u2019 is a particularly\nChinese expression of\nletting things go. Indeed,\ndirector Wang Xiaodi\nwanted this adaptation\nto focus on this philosophical attitude of Tang\nXianzu, basing her script\nadaptation, set, costumes\nand other aspects on this\nidea \u2013 rather than the more\ntypical interpretation of\nthe play as a criticism of\nofficialdom.\nAnd indeed, when it\ncomes down to it, what is\nan \u2018ideal life\u2019? Is it what\nsociety has conditioned\nus to believe is the ideal\npath for us, or is it what\nwe really want? It is\ndifficult to say why Lu\nis so bent on the Handan\nroad, and whether he had\nstopped to explore his\nown motivations. And if\nit is something external\n\u2013 people often pass the\nexams by bribing \u2013 what\ndoes it take to shake the\ndreams off with a laugh?\nPerhaps the ideal life is\nsimply an illusion, a red\nherring, only as real as the\ndream Lu had.\nAlthough Tang originally wrote The Handan\nDream as a traditional\nChinese opera, this adaptation presented it as a\n\u2018ci ju\u2019, or \u2018poetic drama\u2019,\nwhich is a similar style to\nhow Shakespeare writes in\nverse. It retains the beauty\nof the poetic language\nwhile being more accessible to modern audiences.\nThis production also made\nuse of what is known as\n\u2018freehand stage design\u2019, a\nfeature of Chinese opera\nwhere the stage is split into\ntwo layers, one representing reality while the other\nthe dream. During the per-formance, the separation\nbetween the two shifts and\noverlaps, representing the\narbitrary separation and\nLu\u2019s movement between\nthe two.\nThe protagonist Lu is\na typical member of the\nancient Chinese intellectual community. This play\nmakes use of fantastical\nelements to explore their\noutlook towards life, motivations and understanding of their fate, while at\nthe same time expanding\ninto a wider discussion\non human nature and the\nexamined life.\nTang Xianzu\u2019s classic Ming dynasty opera ponders this very question, in a new adaptation by the Guangzhou\nDramatic Arts Centre.\nThe new Yeezy season takes a colourful turn // Ji Qiao\nARTS\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Portrayals are often\none-dimensional, heavy\non aggression and toxic\nmasculinity. In this landscape of facile stereotypes\nwhich are dismissive at\nbest and openly racist at\nworst, playwright Tarell\nAlvin McCraney\u2019s work is\nan oasis of richly layered,\ntender writing.\nMuch like Moonlight,\nfor which McCraney won\nan Oscar last year, The\nBrothers Size explores\nthe bonds between black\nmen and the complexities\nof Southern masculinity.\nThe play, back at the\nYoung Vic after a decade,\nis steeped in allusions\nto Yoruba mythology. It\nfollows two brothers in\nLouisiana. Oshoosi, who\nis younger, has just been\nreleased from the State\nPenitentiary and is living\nwith his older brother\nwhilst on parole. Ogun,\nnamed for the Yoruba\ngod of hard labour,\nwants Oshoosi to clean\nup his act and get back\ninto work. Straight-laced\nOgun and happy-go-lucky Oshoosi clash as\nlong-buried emotions rise\nto the surface, and the two\nattempt to negotiate the\nbittersweet path to reconciliation despite being\nhaunted by Oshoosi\u2019s\ntime in prison. Entangled\nin this family tension is\nOshoosi\u2019s prison-mate\nand erstwhile lover, the\ncharming Elegba, who\nOgun does not trust.\nFrom a relatively\nsimple narrative of\nreunion McCraney\nweaves a script that feels\nAnne Carson-esque, on\nthe cusp between poetry\nand prose. The naturalistic quickfire dialogue\nis peppered with lyrical\nmonologues periodically,\nthe characters slip into\nsong, recalling memories\nthat seem inextricably\nlinked with the melodies.\nUnusually at times the\nactors pause to announce\ntheir stage directions. This\nis a consciously modernist\napproach and it takes\n\u201cIt would be\neasy for the\nplay to fall\napart, but the\nsheer charisma\nof the three\nleads make\nMcCraney\u2019s\nwriting soar\u201d\nsome getting used to, but\non the whole it works \u2013\nadding comic flair to some\nscenes, and conjuring up a\nwoozy, dream-like atmosphere in others.\nIt is an arresting and\noften profound piece of\nwriting, but a script as idiosyncratic as McCraney\u2019s\nstands or falls on the skill\nof the actors. In director\nBijan Sheibani\u2019s produc-tion, there is nowhere to\nhide: there are no props,\nno scenery, and no stage.\nEncircled on all sides by\nthe audience, the actors\nperform inside a white\nchalk circle. It would be\neasy for the play to fall\napart, choked by its own\nintricacies, but the sheer\nblinding charisma of the\nthree leads \u2013 Jonathan\nAjayi, Sope Dirisu, and\nAnthony Welsh \u2013 make\nMcCraney\u2019s writing soar.\nSheibani, who was\nlauded for his work on The\nBarbershop Chronicles,\nalong with choreographer\nAline David, directs the\ntrio to move together in\nsublime harmony. With\nlithe, muscular grace, they\ntumble, sway, and dance\naround each other, palms,\narms, face becoming\ncovered in scattered\nred chalk, all the while\nspeaking in a Southern\npatois - at once colloquial\nand lyrical.

As a result of the\ntenacity of the war-mon-gering Roman elite, a once\nmighty civilization was\nreduced to rubble. Thus,\nif history teaches us any-thing, it is that consensus\ncan be achieved by merely\nreinforcing any viewpoint\nrepeatedly. The whitewashing of the crimes\nand odious views of\nWinston Leonard Spencer\nChurchill has been very\nsuccessful due to the\nbarrage of bipartisan and\nuniversal reverence given\nto him. This is a dangerous example of history\nbeing rewritten by the tide\nof adulation presented\nby numerous books and\nfilms \u2013 most recently Joe\nWright\u2019s Darkest Hour, in\nwhich Gary Oldman plays\nChurchill.\nAfter watching Darkest\nHour, one can not help\nbut be impressed by\nOldman\u2019s performance\nand consequently fall prey\nto the reluctant hero image\nof Churchill that has been\ncultivated since 1945. The\ntrue legacy of Churchill,\nhowever, is far more\ncomplicated and requires\nhonest introspection.\nOne the most inaccurate scenes from the film\nshows Churchill riding the\ntube on his way to Parliament, and in the process,\nby talking to the average\nBrit, he gains the courage\nto oppose any notion of\nsurrender. This would\nhave been uncharacteristic\nof the man who once said,\n\u201cthe best argument against\ndemocracy is a five-min-ute conversation with the\naverage voter\u201d. While this\nharmless scene was added\nfor cinematic effect, it\nnonetheless contained a\ndangerous rewriting of\nhistory, especially since\none of the \u201caverage Brits\u201d\nthat Churchill interacted\nwith was a black man of\nAfrican descent. The real\nChurchill was a white-su-premacist who fervently\nopposed any immigration\nto the UK by people of\ncolour, making it unlikely\nthat real Churchill would\nhave ever treated a black\nman as an equal constit-uent, to whom he was\naccountable.\nThe purpose of\nthis article is to bring\nforth an indictment of\nthe high crimes and\nmisdemeanours of\none of history\u2019s worst\nimperialists. Genocide,\nuse of \u2018weapons of\nmass-destruction\u2019 against\ncivilians, and being an\nardent believer in racial\nsuperiority are only the tip\nof the iceberg.\nHowever, before any of\nthe lesser known travesties\nare examined, we need to\naddress the biggest myth\nof all: Churchill having\nthe foresight regarding the\nneed to combat the evil of\ntotalitarianism. While it\nis true that Churchill had\ncome to realise the danger\nHitler posed from the early\nyears of the Third Reich,\nhis zealot-like opposition\nto socialism meant he\nwas a strong advocate for\nBritish neutrality during\nthe Spanish Civil War.\nBecause of this morally\nbankrupt policy, the fascist\ncoalition of Mussolini\nand Hitler strengthened\nand propelled Franco\nto power. The silence\ntowards the Blitzkrieg\nperpetrated on Barcelona\nand the other great cities\nof Spain was deafening.\nIn fact, in the late 1920s,\nChurchill openly admired\nMussolini\u2019s brutal crackdown on communists by\npraising how \u201cfascism\nhas rendered a service\nto the entire world\u201d.\nChurchill, as displayed by\nthe political positions he\ntook throughout his life,\nopposed Nazism not out\nof any consistent moral\ncompass but instead to\npreserve the tyranny of\nthe British Empire. While\nChurchill was waging war\non behalf of the Poles\nand Czechs to restore\ntheir trampled rights, he\nwas also systematically\ndenying those very rights\nto the colonised world.\nThe aura of Churchill\nstems from the image\nof the underdog status\nBritain unfortunately\ngained when it stood alone\nin Europe fighting against\nthe Nazis. However, the\ntruth couldn\u2019t be further\nfrom the fictitious image\nof little Britain standing\nalone. Britain was never\nalone during the war.\nThe prime-ministers of\n\u201cwhite\u201d commonwealth\nnations of Australia, New\nZealand, Canada, South\nAfrica, and Rhodesia\npledged their continued\nsupport even after the\nfall of France. However,\nthe most astonishing acts\nof solidarity are found\namong those who were\nnot privileged with the\nrights of equality and\nuniversal suffrage; those\nwho were not the masters\nof their destinies, yet still\nvolunteered to fight for\ndemocracy and freedom\nin Europe (those very\nrights which were denied\nto them). India alone contributed over 2.5 million\nvolunteers to fight in the\nwar, who were accompanied by their comrades\nfrom the Caribbean,\nAfrica, the Middle East,\nand South East Asia.\nThe likes of Mao and\nStalin are correctly placed\nin the pantheon of brutal\ndictators alongside Hitler\nand Mussolini, for the\nmass-starvation they\ninflicted on their people.\nThe legacy of the British\nRaj was catastrophic\nfamines, none more so\nthan the Bengal famine of\n1943-44. These were not\nnatural events, but direct\nconsequences of callous\npolicies. The Bengal\nfamine killed over 3\nmillion loyal citizens as a\nresult of Churchill\u2019s racist\nviews regarding Indians \u2013\nhe ordered the export of\nmore than 70,000 tonnes\nof grain out of India in\nJuly of 1943 to shore up\nreserves in Britain and\nfor a disastrous campaign\nin Greece. In Churchill\u2019s\nown words, \u201cstarvation\nof anyhow under-fed\nBengalis is less serious\nthan sturdy Greeks\u201d.\nChurchill\u2019s ambivalence\nIt\u2019s time we stopped avoiding examining Churchill\u2019s crimes // Wikimedia\nPOLITICS\nAvirup Banerjee\nPolitics Editor\nIn films like Darkest Hour, Winston Churchill is whitewashed as an elder statesman whose\nwarnings were ignored. It\u2019s time we examine his imperialist legacy.\ntowards the suffering of\nIndians was considered\nextreme , even by his con-tempories. When ardent\nimperialists like Leopold\nAmery \u2013 secretary of\nstate for India \u2013 implored\nChurchill to act, his only\nresponse was \u201cIndians\nbreed like rabbits\u201d, that\nthey \u201care beastly people\u201d,\nand asking \u201cwhy isn\u2019t\nGandhi dead yet?\u201d More\ntroublingly, when conscience stricken leaders\nin Canada, Australia, and\nAmerica offered to send\ngrain to relieve the famine,\nChurchill declined in the\nfear that they may be sunk\nby Japanese submarines.\nHow was this any different to Stalin\u2019s Holodomor\nin the Ukraine?\nfor the age of empire.\nHowever, Churchill\nmaintained to his cabinet\nthat this pledge only\nextended to the citizens\nof Europe, proclaiming\n\u201cI have not become the\nKing\u2019s First Minister in\norder to preside over the\nliquidation of the British\nEmpire.\u201d\nEven if one were to be\ncharitable and not level\nthe charge of genocide\nbut instead the milder\naccusation of criminal\nnegligence in handling\nthe Bengal famine, the\nMau-Mau rebellion does\nnot leave any room for\nambiguity. After Churchill\u2019s return to power in\n1951, his government\noversaw the suspension\nof habeas-corpus and\nthe forced detention of\n150,000 Kenyans \u2013 men,\nwomen and children \u2013\ninto concentration camps\nin which rape, castration,\nand electric shock torture\nwere the norm. All this\nwas done to protect the\ncolonial apartheid regime.\nWhat was promised to\nhave been left behind in\nNuremburg continued\nunder Churchill\u2019s su-pervision. However, it\nshould not have come as a\nsurprise: after all Churchill was mightily impressed\nby the first ever concentration camps during the\nBoer War.\nThe Geneva Protocol of\n1928 which outlawed the\nuse of chemical and biological weapons did not\nmaterialise in a vacuum.\nPoison gas continued to\nbe in use in warfare after\nthe First World War, once\nagain with Churchill\u2019s\napproval. Whilst serving\nas the Secretary of State\nfor the Colonies in 1921\nhe expressed his desire to\nuse \u201cpoisoned gas against\nthe uncivilized tribes\u201d\nand to provoke \u201cterror\u201d\nin order to subdue any\nresistance to British rule\nin Mesopotamia (modern\nday Iraq).\nChurchill\u2019s contempt\nfor the people of the\nMiddle East was groomed\nin his early years as a\nsolider in the Anglo-Afghan War in the late\n19th\ncentury. He would\nlater write with a proud\nboast of how the British\n\u201cdestroyed the houses,\nfilled up the wells, burned\nthe crops, and broke the\nreservoirs in punitive devastation\u201d to unleash terror\non the the native Pashtun\ntribes.\nto his war-time ally\nJoseph Stalin, \u201cbecause I\nintend to write it\u201d. Unlike\nthe other two leaders of\nallied coalition, Roosevelt\n\u2013 who died in office weeks\nbefore the war would end\n\u2013 and Stalin, Churchill\u2019s\nsix volume, Nobel prize\nwinning account of WWII\nwould shape his enduring\nimage as a wartime leader.\nAnd so Churchill was\nright: history has been\nvery kind to him. Very\nlittle is ever written about\nthe disastrous Norwegian\nCampaign of 1940, which\nwas planned and executed\nby Churchill, but would\nresult in Neville Chamberlin losing support and\nironically propel Churchill\u2019s rise to power.\nIt is important to note\nthat, to his contempories,\nChurchill wasn\u2019t particularly popular. Throughout\nthe 1930s, due to his\nracist opposition to the\nGovernment of India\nAct, he was relegated as\npeople of colour, his early\nwarnings on Hitler might\nnot have fallen on deaf\nears. Interestingly, even\nafter \u201cleading\u201d Britain to\nvictory, he was given the\n\u201corder of the boot\u201d by the\npublicinanoverwhelming\ndefeat in the 1945 general\nelection. Churchill was a\nnot a reconciliatory figure.\nHe never expressed regret\nabout his treatment of\npeople of colour within\nthe British empire. The\nuniversal admiration\ngiven to Churchill is\nsynonymous with what\nNoam Chomsky calls the\n\u201cmanufacture of consent\u201d.\nThe reality remains that in\nmany of the former British\ncolonies, Churchill is not\nrevered as a liberator,\nbut is derided as a gross\nhypocrite, racist, and an\nunrepentent imperialist.\nChurchill should be held in the same regard as colonialists like Cecil Rhodes // CC\n\u201cChurchill\nshowed no\nremorse\ntowards the\nhistorical\ninjustices\nsuffered\nby Native\nAmerican\npeople\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just Indians\nthat Churchill despised.\nHe referred to Palestinian Arabs as \u201cdogs\u201d\nand showed no remorse\ntowards the historiacl\ninjustices suffered by Native-American and Aboriginal-Australian people.\nChurchill\u2019s obscene racial\nviews would be abhorrent to any fair-minded\nindividual \u2013 yet they are\nalways omitted in his\ncountless portrayals in\nthe media. The Atlantic\nCharter, which cemented\nthe Anglo-American\nalliance, was signed with\nwildly different interpre-tation. To Franklin Roosevelt the commitment\nof \u201cright to self-determination\u201d extended to all\nof humanity, serving as\nthe final nail in the coffin\n\u201cMany of the\nproblems\nfacing the\nMiddle\nEast can be\ntraced back\nas products\nof British\nImperialism\nfrom Palestine\nto Iran\u201d\nMany of the problems\nfacing the Middle East\nare still a direct product\nof British imperialism,\nfrom Palestine to Iran.\nAfter Churchill returned\nto power in 1951, the\ndisastrous policies he advocated would ultimately\nproduce the unintended\nconsequence of establishing a rogue theocratic\nregime a generation later.\nIn order to protect the\ninterests of private British\noil corporations, the CIA,\nwith the urgings of British\ngovernment, orchestrated\nthe return to power of the\nbrutal Shah of Iran in a\ncoup against the secular\nand democratically\nelected leader of Iran,\nMohammad Mosaddegh.\nChurchill was consistently on the wrong\nside of history for most\nof the important issues\nof his time \u2013 his fierce\nopposition to the women\u2019s\nsuffrage movement, for\nexample, was exemplified\nby him saying \u201cnothing\nwould induce me to vote\nfor giving women the\nfranchise\u201d.\n\u201cHistory will be kind to\nme,\u201d Churchill remarked\n\u201cThe reality\nremains that\nin many of the\nformer British\ncolonies,\nChurchill is not\nrevered as a\nliberator but\nderided as an\nunrepentent\nimperialist\u201d\na political pariah. Had\nChurchill had a more\nenlightened view towards\n\n"

From\n24th\nJanuary to 18th\nMarch\nit takes over the labyrinth\nof tunnels below Waterloo\nstation every Wednesday\nto Sunday with a program\npacked with theatre, film\nand comedy.\nCreated by London-based contemporary\ncircus team, Chivaree\nCircus, this show is a\nmix of circus and theatre,\nfeaturing fire-breathing,\nacrobatics and aerialists.\nIt\u2019s loosely based on\nthe myth of Persephone\nand her abduction by\nHades, God of the Underworld. The audience\nis greeted by a masked\nfigure, Charon, and\ninvited to journey into the\nunderworld with Charon\nand the three \u2018Furies\u2019,\nperformers wearing\ndog-like headgear, representing the three-headed\ndog Cerberus. It\u2019s a far cry\nfrom the standard seated\nshow you might expect\nthough: the audience are\nguided through the vast,\nopen space that is the\nForge, the Vaults\u2019 largest\nvenue, as the performance\ntakes place around us, the\ncast gently shepherding us\nfrom place to place. We\ngather around Rebecca\nRennison as Persephone\nfor a contemporary dance\nsequence, the three Furies\nenthrall with juggling\nand fire-breathing \u2013 a\nrepresentation of Hades \u2013\nand we are led across the\nForge in a journey that\nmimics Persephone\u2019s on\nthe river Styx, here represented by ropes pulled by\nthe cast.\nThis is where the\nperformance begins to\nfocused less on storytelling and more on awe and\nspectacle. However, this\nfocus doesn\u2019t always play\nto its strength \u2013 in many\nparts it feels more like a\nsequence of separate acts\nthan a story as a whole\nand many seemingly key\naspects are easily lost on\nthe audience. The cast\nclearly represent Persephone, Hades and other\ninhabitants of the under-world, but the details of\nwho they are get easily\nlost.\nIn a lesser show, this\nmight have been perfor-mance-ruining, but the\nstrength of the performers\nis such that, even when\nit\u2019s confusing, Becoming\nShades is still somehow\namazing. At one point we\nare invited to encircle a\nlonesome figure dancing\non a pole, taunted by the\nother performers around\nher. Her dance is amazing\nand the claustrophobia of\nthe audience and other\ncast members encircling\nher only adds to the sense\nof palpable distress. This\nis far from the only impressive routine; there\u2019s\nmore amazing acrobatic\nwork, with elaborate\nacrobatic performances\nusing only ribbons and\nrings suspended from the\nceiling.\nThis isn\u2019t to stay that\nthe entire show is flawless.\nA brief comic interlude\non \u2018how to train your\nhellhound\u2019 is jarring \u2013 it\nmakes little sense and the\ntone is so completely out\nof keeping with the rest\nof the performance that it\nseems hardly part of the\nsame show.\nThe all-female cast are\nwithout a doubt the best\npart of Becoming Shades.\nRebecca Rennison\nas Persephone really\nleaves an impression;\nas does Alfa Marks as\nHades. Rosie Bartley,\nJessica Pearce and Isobel\nMidnight are brilliant as\nthe \u2018Furies\u2019. They drive\nthe performance, forming\nthe bridge between the\nbeautiful aerial solos of\nthe two stars. They don\u2019t\nrest and, even during the\ninterval, they remain in\ncharacter, interacting with\nthe audience in a way\nthat prevents the mood of\nHades from dissipating.\nThe other stand-out\naspect of the performance is the music. The\noriginal score, created\nby Sam West, captures\nPersephone\u2019s tragic melancholy and the darkness\nand terror of Hades. It\u2019s\nrendered all the more\neffective by the live performance from West and\nfellow performer Becks\nJohnstone, whose operatic\nvoice perfectly captures\nthe eerie melancholy of\nthis particular version of\nHades.\nDespite its flaws, there\nis a lot to be said for\nBecoming Shades: it\u2019s\ncertainly different from\nstandard theatre or circus\nand there is a uniqueness\nto the experience that\ncan\u2019t be overstated. If\nyou fancy an immersive\nperformance and want to\ntry something different,\nit\u2019s a show that wont leave\nyou feeling disappointed.\nPart theatre, part circus, Becoming Shades isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s an experience that will leave you in awe.\nstray from the story it is\nsupposed to be telling.\nFor the bulk of the per-formance, the links to the\nmyth are loose and the\nreferences to it are often\nhard to grasp beyond\nthe overall themes and\naesthetic; this is a show\nDance and acrobatics save the plot in this immersive\nUnderworld\nWear your face mask: the air in the Underworld is like, really, really bad // Maximilian Webster\n\u201cPerformers\nare so strong\nthat, even\nwhen it\u2019s\nconfusing,\nBecoming\nShades is still\namazing\u201d\nARTS\nVaishnavi Nathan\nArts Writer\nWhere?

From \u00a322.50\nBECOMING SHADES\nISIS, 4Chan, and WhatsApp: Theatre for the Lulz\nFor a play examining the radicalisation of young men, Javaad Alipoor\u2019s production finds an innovative way to\nbring its audience together.\nT\nhe Believers Are\nBut Brothers\nopens at the Bush\nTheatre, after an\naward-winning run at the\nEdinburgh Fringe in 2017.\nIt tells the stories of three\nyoung men who, through\ntheir encounters online,\nbecome exposed to and\nenveloped by the murky\nwaters of extremism.\nTwo of the stories follow\nyoung British Muslims;\nAtif from the south coast\nwho travels to Syria to\njoin ISIS and Marwan,\nfrom the \u2018post-industrial\nNorth\u2019, who volunteers\nto join an aid convoy to\nSyria. The third story\nfollows Ethan, a 21-year\nold white man from\nCalifornia, obsessed with\n4Chan and the alt-right.\nThe Believers is undoubtedly timely though\nstrangely one of the only\npieces of theatre willing\nto tackle radicalisation\nin all forms head-on.\nBut what makes the play\ntruly unique, is its use of\nWhatsApp. Prior to the\nshow-day, an email was\nsent out to attendees,\nencouraging them to sign\nup to a WhatsApp group\nto \u2018enhance your experience\u2019. On the outset, this\nappeared to be a small\nquirk of the show, perhaps\neven a gimmick. But as\nthe play progressed, it\nbecame clear that being\na member of the group\nwas not only essential to\nfollow the narrative, but\nallowed for the audience\nto engage with a piece of\ntheatre in a completely\nnew and exciting manner.\nBilled as a one-man\nplay, the production actually features two\nactors, both of whom are\ncritical to it success. The\nfirst \u2013 the \u2018Performer\u2019 \u2013 is\nJvaad Alipoor, the play\u2019s\nwriter and co-director. It is\nAlipoor alone that speaks\nto the audience and recites\nthe stories of The Believers. The second \u2013 the\n\u2018Operator\u2019 \u2013 is a mute at a\nkeyboard, lingering in the\nmurk of cold-blue computer light at the back of\nthe stage, played by Luke\nEmery. His role is operate\nthe technical aspects of\nThe Believers; which\nprimarily involves sending WhatsApp messages\nto the Believers group.\nIt would be easy for\nthis play to take aim at\nsocial media and the\nrole of the internet in\nradicalising young men.\nand had the play been\nwritten by an outsider to\ninternet culture looking\nin, I fear the play may\nhave hit such a dud note.\nThankfully, Alipoor is\nas qualified a playwright\nfor The Believers as one\ncould hope for: by his\nown admission, a fan of\nencryption-based messaging and a young man\nwho has connected with\nnumerous new people\nonline. Alipoor is also a\nBritish Muslim, frustrated\nby the media narrative surrounding his community,\na narrative that he: a. does\nnot recognise and b. is not\nallowed to partake in. He\nis a Bradford native, serving as Artistic Director for\nthe Northern Lines theatre\ncompany that works with\ncommunities in the city\nwho do not normally\nengage with theatre.\nAlipoor delivers\neach story in segments,\nalternating his position\non-stage for each and\nregularly breaking the\nfourth wall during transi-tions, to comment on the\nproceedings or provide\nbackground to the peculiarities of 4Chan.Although\nnever quite acting per se,\nAlipoor is a truly excellent\nstoryteller. His recounting\nof the characters\u2019 tales\nis delivered with such\nemboldened conviction\nthat each story takes on\na life of its own, distinct\nfrom others not just in its\ncontent, but in the Alipoor\nwho tells it. On their own,\nthe stories are compelling.\nAt the play\u2019s climax,\nhowever, Alipoor ties the\nlives of Atif, Marwan, and\nEthan together in a spectacular sequence fitting for\nsuch a bold piece of work.\nFitting too, that in a\nplay that discusses meme\nculture and the serious issues of racism and misogyny that stem from it, the\nplay is able to switch from\nhumour to sombreness on\na dime. Midway through\nthe play, Alipoor asks the\nWhatsApp group, \u2018What\u2019s\nthe weirdest thing you\u2019ve\nseen on the internet?\u2019.\nCue the chorus of notification pings and audience\nchuckles as the accounts\nof witnessing strange porn\nflow in. Then, a user by\nthe name of \u2018Forthelulz\u2019\nchimes in, \u201cFucking\nwhiney feminists\u2026.\u201d\nhe begins, and proceeds\nto message half a dozen\ngrotesque paragraphs\nabout rape and murder,\ndrawing gasps from the\ncrowd. Of course, the\naccount is under the control of Emery and despite\nmost, one imagines, in\nthe crowd being aware of\nthis it puts an immediate\nend to the audience\u2019s\nmessages and laughter.\nSo too, the play\u2019s\ncomparison of the radical-isation processes of ISIS\nand the alt-right is poign-ant, not because of their\ndifferences but because of\ntheir shocking similarity.\nTo quote one of Alipoor\u2019s\nonline acquaintances, a\ngay Rabbi from Alabama,\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a bigot when\nyou pick the book up\nyou\u2019ll be a bigot when\nyou put the book down.\u201d\nInterspersed between the stories and\naudience engagement,\nAlipoor delivers a fourth\nnarrative; the conception\nof ISIS from its roots in\n1950s Egypt, through to\nAl-Qaeda and Osama bin\nLadin, and eventually\nits founder and leader\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nAlthough these stories are\ndelivered with the same\ndistinctive Alipoor flair,\nthey fail to add anything\nsignificant to the overall\nplot of the play, and time\nwould have been better\nspent with the \u2018brothers\u2019.\nIn the play\u2019s final act,\nAlipoor sends a speech\nto the WhatsApp group,\none sentence at a time, the\ngoal being that a random\nmember of the audience\nwill read the line aloud for\nthe room to hear before the\nnext is sent. Ironic, then,\nthat in a play focusing\nentirely on young men,\nthe vast majority of voices\nto read aloud are those of\nwomen.\nIn his Foreword to the\nplay\u2019s script, Madani\nYounis, Artistic Director\nat the Bush Theatre\ncomments that \u201cThis\nis not an echo chamber\nplay.\u201d Sure, Alipoor has\nwritten a play focusing\non two tiny subsections\nof society, but they\u2019re\ntwo subsections that\nhave a disproportionate\nimpact on the news and\ncontent that everyone in\nthe western world \u2013 men,\nwomen, Muslim, secular\n\u2013 engages with and reacts\nto online. And away from\nthe play\u2019s portrayal of the\nmost extreme of extreme\ngroups, it provides a commentary on the larger role\nof social media in society;\nits ability accelerate the\ntransfer of ideas - good\nand bad \u2013 and bring total\nstrangers together.\nThe theatre is normally\na reserved environement;\naudiences sit in reverence\nand pitch blackness,\nhonouring the work of\nthe actors before them.\nThe Believers shows that\nit is possible to appreciate and engage with a\nperformance in spite of a\ncacophony of phones and\nconstant flaring of screens.\nNever have I felt so connected to those around me\nduring a play. Rare is it\nthat a play can prove to be\nas thought-provoking for\nits means of delivery as its\nstory, acting and message.\nRarer still is it to find a\nplay that, although not\nperfect, is unequivocally a\nmust-see.\nOne-v-one me on Rust, n00b // The Other Richard\nARTS\nAdam Gellatly\nArts Editor\nWhere?

While\nTheresa May announced\nin October that tuition\nfees would be frozen\nfor the upcoming year, a\nnumber of student groups\ncontinue to have concerns\nover the link between\nTEF and marketisation of\nhigher education.\nThe NSS is sent out\neach year to final year\nundergraduates at higher\neducation institutions in\nthe UK.

Last\nOctober, it was announced\nthe President of the\nGraduate Students\u2019 Union\n(GSU) \u2013 one of Imperial\u2019s\nsix Constituent Unions,\nrepresenting taught and\nresearch postgraduates\n\u2013 would become a paid,\npart-time role. The role\nwill take up two working\ndays a week, and the GSU\nPresident will receive a\nstipend of \u00a310,000. Luke\nMcCrone, the current\nGSU President, told Felix\nat the time: \u201cI am certain\nthe position will be more\nhotly contested in future,\nhopefully helping to\nattract better quality candidates.\u201d\nThis year will also see\nthe traditional two week\ncampaigning period \u2013 one\nweek of campaigning\nbefore voting opened, and\nthen a further week of\ncampaigning while voting\ntook place \u2013 replaced with\na single week of voting\nand campaigning.\nA spokesperson for the\nbegins, and voting opens\nat the same time.\u2019 They\nalso cited the new week of\ntraining as providing more\nsupport for candidates.\nReaction to the new\nvoting period has been\nmixed. Claudia Caravello,\nPresident of the City and\nGuilds College Union\n(CGCU), told Felix: \u201cI\nthink students having\nto spend only one week\ncampaigning will be\nbetter for their studies\nand wellbeing, but it will\nrequire candidates to\nplan their campaigns a\nlot more. The campaign\nperiod will intensify, and\nthe week will go by pretty\nquickly.\u201d\nOthers cited concerns\nover the advantage it\nmight give some students.\nAbhijay Sood, Academic\nAffairs Officer for the\nRoyal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) told\nFelix: \u201cBy eliminating\nthe pre-voting campaign\nperiod, the Union are\ndenying those who are\nless well known on\ncampus the change to get\ntheir names out there, and\ngiving others an unfair\nadvantage.

Netball\ngained 40% of the vote,\nwith 216 students choosing the 1st team for the\nHeadline match. Kabaddi\nachieved 32% of the vote,\nand Men\u2019s Rugby (1st\nTeam) gained 29%. This\nmeans that IC Kabaddi\nwill be playing the Showcase match; they played\ntheir first match as part of\nVarsityFest only last year.\nThe choice of Netball\nfor the Headline match\ncomes after they previously played the Showcase\nmatch at VarsityFest 2017.\nIn their application, they\nsaid the team were well\nsuited to headline VarsityFest due to the \u201cfast-paced\nand high-scoring nature of\nthe game\u201d, and promised\nto \u201coffer a competitive\nmatch that is unlikely to\nbe one-sided\u201d.\nEllen Fletcher, Club\nCaptain of Imperial\nCollege Netball, told\nFelix: \u201cThe 1s have had\nan incredible start to\n2018, and haven\u2019t lost a\nmatch yet \u2013 despite some\ninitial nerves, the team\nare now working hard to\nkeep their winning streak\ngoing through to Varsity!\nIt\u2019s an exciting change\nthat a women\u2019s sport will\nbe headlining, and I think\nit shows how much people\nenjoyed the Showcase last\nyear, and how far both\nclubs have come.\u201d\nA Union representative\ntold Felix: \u201cThe student\npoll on Varsity\u2019s Headline\nand Showcase has really\nopened up the event to\ninclude a spotlight on\nnewer and developing\nsports, while highlighting\nImperial\u2019s inclusive sporting community. Netball\u2019s\nsuccessful Showcase\nin 2017 continues to be\nsupported by students,\npushing them on to\nachieve 2018\u2019s Headline.\u201c\nThis year is the first\ntime the Headline match\nhas been a women\u2019s\nteam since 2015, when\nWomen\u2019s Rugby were the\ncentrepiece. Their game\nwas overshadowed by a\nnumber of issues, including transport mix-ups\nmeaning coaches left\nearly, and allegations of\nverbal abuse from staff\nmembers. The captain of\nthe club said at the time\nthat the events \u201chighlighted the sexisn that is unfortunately very present\nat Imperial.\u201d\nVarsityFest is in its\n16th\nyear, and will see\nICSM teams competing\nagainst Imperial College\nteams across 11 sports.\nThe matches will take\nplace across three dates:\nwater polo on Friday 23rd\nFebruary; Hockey VarsityFest on Wednesday\n28th\nMarch; and the main\nVarsityFest on Saturday\n3rd\nMarch.\nthe decision \u201cdeeply dis-appointing, short-sighted,\nand unjust\u201d. It also argues\nthat it goes against Sport\nImperial\u2019s \u201ccurrent strategy of promoting mental\nand physical wellbeing\u201d.\nThe St. Mary\u2019s Hospital Association (SMHA),\nthe alumnus organisation\nfor the St. Mary\u2019s medical\nschool graduates, also\ncited concerns over com-munication. They said\nthey \u201cdeplore the lack of\nconsultation that appears\nto have occurred prior to\nthe closure of the pool\nbeing announced.\u201d\nIn a statement to Felix,\nrepresentatives of the\nSMHA said: \u201cIn financially constrained times, we\nfully recognise the need\nfor tough decisions to be\nmade regarding facilities\nfor students and staff. It\nmay be the case that the\npool has been underused\nin recent years, but this\nmay be because of poor\nmarketing and under-investment. Talking to\ncolleagues in the hospital,\nvery few are even aware\nof the existence of a pool\nin the medical school.\u201d\n\u201cWe strongly back\nthe need for open,\nthoughtful consultation\nand publication of the\nfacts relating to usage\nof the pool and efforts at\nincome-generation that\nhave been tried before a\nfinal decision is made.\u201d\nACollegespokesperson\nsaid \u201cthe costs of required\nmaintenance mean it is\nnot sustainable to continue running this facility\u201d,\nand that the pool\u2019s closure\n\u201cis part of the College\u2019s\nwider cost savings which\nare designed to allow for\nreinvestment of funds into\nthe academic mission.\u201d\nThe petition refers to\nthe long history of St.\nMary\u2019s pool, which has\nbeen open for 80 years.\nKevin Brown, Trust\nArchivist for Imperial\nCollege Healthcare NHS\nTrust and Curator of\nthe Alexander Fleming\nMuseum Laboratory, told\nFelix of the pool\u2019s historical pedigree:\n\u201cAlexander Fleming\nwas one of the first users\nof the swimming pool\nwhen it opened in the\nearly 1930s.

There is a wide\nrange of other venomous\nanimals too \u2013 including\nthe platypus, jellyfish,\nand, surprisingly, two\nspecies of frogs! To be\nclear, venom is a toxin\nthat requires a delivery\nsystem such as a stinger\nor a fang. Venoms are\noften confused with poisons which conversely\nhave to be ingested for\ntheir effects to be deadly.\nThe paradox with\nvenom is that while it can\ncause harm, it can also\ndo some good! Recent\nresearch has shown it\nmay provide a potential\ncure to diseases such as\ncancer. As someone who\nhas been fascinated with\nvenomous animals since\na young age, I took the\nopportunity to visit an\nexhibition at the Natural\ndifferent purposes. For\nexample, snakes and cone\nshells share the use of\nvenom as a tool for preda-tion; bees and wasps use\nit as a defensive mecha-nism; and it also allows\nfor easier blood feeding\nfor vampire bats! There\nare numerous diverse\ndelivery mechanisms and\nfunctions of venom within\nthe animal kingdom,\nand many of these were\nhighlighted in the exhibit.\nAs much as I enjoyed the\ninitial hall, where you are\nintroduced to different\nanimal groups and how\ntheir venoms differ, I\nfeel that plants were left\nout for the single reason\nthat they do not generate\nmuch interest. Yet plants\nare venomous!

This is an area I\nfind interesting, particularly how our understanding of venom has changed\nover time, as well as the\ntreatment! I would recommend visiting the exhibition if you, like me, have\nan interest in the natural\nworld and the world of\nvenom systems. The fact\nthat the museum is only\na couple of doors down\nfrom the South Kensington campus makes it particularly inviting! If you\nare planning on going, it\ndoes cost to enter \u2013 but\nfear not: the National\nHistory Museum has\na special discount\nfor Imperial College\nstudents, so make sure to\nshow your student card\non entry.

In\nreality, the proper definition of a planet is more\nimportant than just the\nsemantics. It can provide\nastronomers finding new\ncelestial objects with a\nbasis of classification,\nthus making it easier to\nidentify if the object under\ninvestigation is a planet\nor not. This distinction is\nimportant for scientists as\nit provides indirect ways\nof inferring properties of\nthose \u201cplanets\u201d by using\nideal comparisons with\ncloser, and easier to ob-serve, planets.\nKevin Schlaufman, an\nastrophysicist at Johns\nHopkins University, has\nproposed an upper limit on\nthe mass of space objects\nthat qualify as a \u201cplanet\u201d.\nAccording to his most\nrecent study, this upper\nbound of a mass should\nbe between four and ten\ntimes the mass of Jupiter.\nHowever, this is only an\nexclusionary criterion,\ndisqualifying anything\nheavier than that as a\nplanet. Anything lower in\nweight would need further\ninvestigation in order\nto classify. This finding\nis significant because\nit helps to distinguish a\nvery large planet from a\nbrown dwarf \u2013 an object\nwhose mass lies between\nthat of a very large planet\nand a star. These are\nself-luminescent, and\nhotter than a planet due\nto deuterium and lithium\nfusion, but they are\nnot massive enough to\nsupport the nuclear fusion\nof protium (hydrogen).\nAccording to Schlaufman,\nthe current classification\nis insufficient and leaves\nambiguity in results.\nHe proposed another\ncriterion to settle the\ndebate: the chemical\nmake-up of the closest\nstars. This argument\nroots from the process\nof the formation of stars.\nThe giant planets such as\nJupiter form from a bot-tom-up process \u2013 a rocky\nbase is built, which is then\nenveloped by a gaseous\natmosphere. Since planets\nanalysed 146 planetary\nsystems and inferred a\nfew facts about space\nobjects: those greater\nthan ten times the size\nof Jupiter are seldom\nfound near these heavy\nmetal enriched stars who\nprovide resources for\ntheir development. Thus,\nany celestial object lying\nabove the upper limit\nidentified should be categorised as a brown dwarf\nas opposed to a planet.\nThough this may end up\nopening a fierce debate \u2013\nsimilar to the exclusion\nof Pluto as a planet from\nour solar system \u2013 but\nthe development of a\nrobust definition eases\nthe identification of new\nplanets and their study. As\nour picture of the universe\ngets bigger, a more\nmethodical definition is\nrequired to help provide a\nclearer view.\nSCIENCE\nVarshit Dusad\nScience Writer\nRIP Pluto // Wikimedia\nConnect with conservation \u2013 Visiting Venom\n\u201cAnother\ncriterion for\ndeciding class\nis the chemical\nmake-up of\nclosest stars\u201d\nBut the brown dwarf\nforms due to gravitational\ninstability which leads\nto the mass of clouds to\ncollapse over itself. This\nprocess is like the formation of a star.\nSo how do the planetary\nlimits become relevant?\nWell, Schlaufman\nFind out more and register online\nimperial.ac.uk/imperial-award\nReflect on your experiences\nGain the Imperial Award\nBenefits of registering and participating in the Award\n\u25a0 You can access a personal,\nprivate online portfolio\nallowing you to track your\nactivities and experiences.\n\u25a0 You\u2019ll get a line on your\ntranscript for each Stream\nyou complete and an extra\nline if you achieve the full\nImperial Award.\n\u25a0 Participating will improve\nyour writing skills,\nhelping with job and grant\napplications.\n\u25a0 You will develop attributes\nhighly valued by employers.\n\u25a0 There is nothing to lose,\nonly successful students\nhave the outcome recorded.\n\u25a0 The Imperial Award is\ndevelopmental, the skills\nyou learn and attributes you\ndevelop will remain with\nyou forever.\n\u25a0 There are plenty of support\nresources available,\nincluding workshops, videos\nand your personal tutor.\nA novel tool for the future of heart repair\nBiomechanical mapping provides useful information for regenerating lost heart tissue due to heart attack.\nH\neart attacks\ncause the heart\nto be temporarily starved\nof blood flow and oxygen\ndue to a blockage in the\ncoronary arteries, which\ndeliver oxygen-rich blood\nto the heart. This blockage leads to scar tissue\nwithin the heart. As we\nage, this damage is often\ndeemed irreversible due\nto the heart\u2019s inability to\nreplace damaged tissue\nwith regenerated healthy\ntissue. The irreversibility\nof this tissue damage affects the daily life of heart\nattack survivors, reducing\nthe heart\u2019s efficiency in\npumping blood to the rest\nof the body. When muscles do not receive enough\noxygenated blood, heart\nattack survivors can feel\nfatigue or shortness of\nbreath, among other unfavourable sensations. More\nseriously, scar tissue in the\nheart can lead to congestive heart failure or dilated\ncardiomyopathy \u2013 both of\nwhich are fatal conditions.\nFor the researchers at the\nUniversity of Houston\n\u2013 in collaboration with\nthe Baylor College of\nMedicine and the Texas\nHeart Institute \u2013 finding a\nmethod to reverse damage\nto the heart tissue following a heart attack has been\ntheir primary aim. They\nhave recently gotten one\nstep closer to their goal by\nusing an optical technique\nto compare the mechanical\nproperties of healthy heart\ntissue with damaged heart\ntissue in mice models,\nwhich they plan to use to\ntest the effectiveness of\nregeneration techniques.\nIn the first study of its\nkind, Kirill V. Larin of\nthe University of Houston\nSCIENCE\nCaroline Wolfe\nScience Writer\nand James F. Martin of\nthe Baylor College of\nMedicine used a technique\nknown as OCE \u2013 optical\ncoherence elastography,\ndeveloped in Larin\u2019s lab\n\u2013 to map the mechanical\nproperties of the heart.\nOCE is based on optical\ncoherence tomography, a\nhigh-resolution biomedical imaging technique.\nAs MRI and ultrasound\nboth provide information\nabout tissue mechanics on\na larger scale than necessary to image mice hearts,\nOCE was deemed most\nappropriate for use. OCE\nhas nanoscale sensitivity,\nand its resolution is ideal\nin determining if healthy\ntissues begin replacing\nscar tissue due to therapy.\ntissue exhibit different responses to the mechanical\nstimulation. Based on the\nresponses of healthy tissue\nversus damaged tissue,\nthe researchers were able\nto develop mathematical\nmodels to represent the\nbiomechanical properties\nof the cells.\nLarin and Martin\ninduced heart attacks in\nmice, then waited six\nweeks for scar tissue to\nform before excising\nthe hearts to perform\nOCE. This enabled them\nto gather information\nregarding the mechanical\nproperties of healthy\ntissue versus scar tissue.\nDuring the ex-vivo study,\nthe hearts were soaked\nin potassium chloride\nto ensure a uniform\nthat the muscle fibres in\nthe damaged tissue were\nstiffer and more disorganised than the fibres in the\nhealthy tissue. This was\ndeduced from the decrease\nin elastic wave velocity,\nnatural frequency, and\nanisotropy (directionality\ndependent) reaction to the\nwave propagation in the\ndamaged cells, respec-tively.\nBoth researchers hope\nto continue using OCE to\ngather mechanical properties of regenerated tissue\nin order to develop a cure\nfor scar tissue in the heart.\nThe scarring in the mouse\nhearts is believed to be\nsimilar to the scarring\nthat humans incur due to\nheart attack, making this\nmethod of mechanical\nmapping applicable to the\nover 75,000 people that\nsuffer a heart attack in the\nUK every year.\n\u201cIrreversible\ntissue damage\naffects the\ndaily life of\nheart attack\nsurvivors,\ncausing\nshortness of\nbreath\u201d\nOCE is made up of\nan imaging unit and an\nair-pulse delivery unit\nwhich involves very small\nmechanical waves applied\nto the heart tissue in the\nform of low-pressure air\npulses.

After\nvomiting on the sidewalk\nhe is helped by a woman,\nFrau Hanna Schmitz, in\nher thirties. Once he has\nrecovered, he decides to\nthank her for her help.\nWhat began as a gesture\nof gratitude, with dubious\nintentions, led to a love\naffair between the two.\nAfter a few months\ninto this affair, Schmitz\ninexplicably leaves town\nand Michael, leaving him\nto question their relationship and whether she\never shared his feelings\nfor her. Fast forward a\nfew years and Michael, a\nstudent studying Law at\nuniversity, joins a Professor\u2019s seminar dealing with\nthe trials of people with\nlinks to the Nazi regime,\nwhether facilitating it in\nthe form of prison guards\nat concentration camps or\nturning a blind eye to it.\nObserving one of these\ntrials, Michael recognises\none of the defendants:\nHanna Schmitz.\nHe becomes engrossed\nwith this trial, never\nmissing a day. He starts\nto feel numb towards her,\ncondemning her actions\nwith all of his being, only\nto recant those condemnations when reminiscing\nabout their relationship.\nHe finds himself in the\nturmoil of trying to come\nto terms with his country\u2019s recent history which\nseems to clash directly\nwith his own adolescence.\nThis novel explores\na range of issues and\nhandles them extremely\nwell given its relatively\nshort length. The writing\nis stark, bare of any\nsuperfluous descriptions,\nenabling the reader to\nassume a position of\ndetachedness from the\ncharacters.\nThis, I believe, allowed\nme to objectively judge\nthe characters and the\nsituations they were\ninvolved in without the\nauthor invoking those\njudgements through\nin-depth descriptions of\nthe characters\u2019 thoughts\nand feelings. It permits\nthe reader to arrive at their\nown conclusions without\nbeing nudged there by the\nauthor, which is something I really appreciated\ngiven the topics that were\ndealt with.\nIt would have been so\neasy for the author to make\nMichael condemn and\ndisown his own memories\nof Hanna once he realises\nthe atrocities she has\ncommitted, a position that\nmany people would sym-pathise with. Yet he deliberately allows Michael to\nreturn to those memories\n\u201cThe novel\ndoes not shirk\naway from\ndeconstructing\nhow guilt\nis handed\naround and\nshared\u201d\n\u201cSchlink also\ndeals with how\na country tries\nto reconcile\nwith its recent\npast, in an\neffort to heal\nitself\u201d\nto question Hanna\u2019s guilt\nand whether she deserves\nhis denouncement.\nSchlink also deals with\nhow a country tries to\nreconcile and confront its\nrecent past, in an effort\nto heal itself. How easy\nit is for the generation\nthat came into adulthood\nafter the end of the war to\ncondemn and judge those\nthey perceived to have\nbeen complicit, almost to\nthe point of making them\nfeel good, a prototype of\nwhat we term political\ncorrectness today.\nWhile some undoubtedly deserve those\ncondemnations, whether\nthose who kept silent do is\na different matter. \u2018What\nwould you have done?\u2019 - a\nquestion Hanna puts to\nthe judge during her trial\nis one this new generation\nhas not contemplated\ncarefully in their frenzy\nto assume a higher moral\nground, but is one which\nMichael grapples with.\nWhether he would have,\nwere it not for his personal\ninvolvement with one\nof those defendants, is a\nquestion left to the reader,\nand one I would have to\nanswer with a resounding\nno.\nThe novel has been criticised for trying to invoke\nsympathy to Nazi crimi-nals, questioning Hanna\u2019s\ntrue extent of participation in those crimes and,\nby extension, her guilt. I\ncannot disagree more; the\nnovel does not shirk away\nfrom deconstructing how\nguilt is handed around and\nshared, painting a grey\npicture of how humans\ndeal with morality in such\ncircumstances, rather than\nthe black and white one\npeople seem to want it to.\nThe questions that\nMichael grapples with are\nquite philosophical and\nposed in such a way that\nthey demand the reader\nto at least ponder them\nbefore moving on to the\nnext sentence. Despite\nbeing mostly ignorant of\nphilosophy, I found these\nquestions very accessible\nand posed in a way that\nmakes the reader want to\nthink about them and form\ntheir own opinion rather\nthan an exercise in highlighting the author\u2019s great\nintellect. These questions\nretain the beauty, or some\nmight argue the frustrating aspect, of philosophy:\nthere is no right answer.\nBernhard Schlink, author of The Reader // Wikimedia\nContemplating troubled pasts in the City of Literature\nTravellingtoplaceswitharichhistoryistheperfectbackdropforexploringbooksthatmighthaveanenlightening\ncultural connection\nBOOKS\nPavan Inguva\nBooks Writer\nT\nhe seeds of this\narticle were\nsowed over\nDecember break,\nduring a weekend I spent\nin Hamburg, Germany\nand a visit to Lubeck\n(Birthplace of Thomas\nMann), followed by a\nweek in Poland.\nI only found out when\nin Krakow, that it is designated a UNESCO city of\nliterature. This made more\nsense after learning about\nKrakow\u2019s literary culture\nsuch as the large number\nof bookstores, literary festivals and famous authors\nassociated with the city.\nHaving finished the first\nbook, The Woman of the\nDunes by Kobo Abe, I\npicked a second book by\nPolish Author Czeslaw\nMilosz whilst in Krakow\nfor the rest of my trip,\nreviews of which will be\nthe subject of this article.\nKobo Abe\u2019s The Woman of the Dunes\nThis story starts off\nwith Niki Junpei, a\nslightly socially awkward,\navid insect collector who\ndecides to take a weekend\ntrip to some sand dunes\nin a rural part of Japan,\nin hopes of finding rare\nor even new species of\nbeetles. He is subsequently trapped and enslaved\nby the villagers in a sand\ndune approximately 60ft\n\u201cThis book\nserved as\nan excellent\nbackdrop to\nmy visit to\nPoland\u201d\n\u201cThis placed\nMilosz in a\nposition to\nshed light on\nthe history\nand psyche of\nPoland and its\npeople\u201d\nunderground together\nwith an initially cold\nwoman who houses him.\nKobo Abe skilfully shows\nhow a person\u2019s inner\nmonologue and the praxis\ninto outward action (both\npersonally and in how he\nrelates to other people)\nchanges during such a\ndark period of capture,\nfrom initial resistance to\nbargaining and blackmail\nand finally, the loss of the\ndesire to escape.\nThe man first tries to\nreason with his captors\nto no avail. His efforts to\nescape escalate further till\nhe finally succeeds one\nday only to horribly fail by\naccidentally falling into a\nquicksand pit. He is hu-miliatingly lowered back\ninto the pit. Following his\nrecapture, he slowly loses\nthe will to escape.\nHis interaction with\nthe woman who has been\ntrapped for much longer\nthan him yields further\ninsight into the psyche in\nrelation to her predicament and the outer world.\nAt the end, the man has a\nworkable plan of escape\nbut decides to postpone\nit indefinitely, indicating\nhis loss of the will to\nescape. This ending has\nbeen compared to George\nOrwell\u2019s 1984 which bears\nremarkable similarities.\nOn a literal reading,\nKobo Abe does a great job\nin showing how a person\nresponds to an externally\nimposed state of imprisonment and throughout\nthis read, the very injustice imposed onto both the\nman and woman partially\ntriggered me. This served\nas an excellent backdrop\nto my visit to Poland\nwhich in the 20th century\nwas profoundly affected\nby both great wars and the\nrise and fall of the Soviet\nUnion.\nHowever, it is also\npossible to consider this\nstory from a metaphysical standpoint of Zen\nBuddhism, almost as a\nsort of Sisyphean task,\nand view the man\u2019s en-snarement as the mechanism to which humans are\nbound to the Maya of the\nmaterial world.\nCzeslaw Milosz\u2019s The\nCaptive Mind\nCzeslaw Milosz, the\npolish author and poet was\nthe recipient of the 1980\nNobel prize in Literature.\nHis life story involves\nseveral major events of\nthe 20th century, (un)\nfortunately giving him a\nfirst-hand experience to\nparadigm-altering events\nsuch as the rise of Hitler,\nthe Holocaust and the\nrise and fall of the Soviet\nUnion to name a few.\nThis placed Milosz in\na position to shed light on\nthe history and psyche of\nPoland and its people and\non the nature of oppression and totalitarianism,\nwhich he did so exceedingly well in The Captive\nMind. Despite this book\nbeing contextualised\nto Stalinism in Eastern\nEuropean countries, the\nanalysis remains relevant\nand applicable.\nThe first three chapters\nset up the psychologi-cal, philosophical and\nsocial context in which a\nperson\u2019s mind becomes\ncaptive whilst living under\ntotalitarian rule. The first\nchapter describes how and\nwhy Stalinist ideology,\nparticularly Dialectic Materialism is stomached by\na person. This is done by\nusing the metaphor of the\n\u2018Pill of Murti-Bing\u2019 based\non another book written\nby Stanislaw Witkiewicz.\nThe second chapter\ndetails the nature of\nCentral and Eastern\nEuropean people\u2019s perception of the free western\nstates and its associated\nhistorical and psychological tensions and how this\nsets the context to which\neastern-bloc intellectuals\nmay not be drawn to the\nwest.\nThe third chapter\ndescribes the practice of\nKetman, where an individual hides his true beliefs\nfrom others, in doing so,\nderives a sense of satisfaction for such deceit. This\npartially robs him of the\nwill to outwardly reject\nthat ideology.\nMilosz then goes on to\ndescribe how four Polish\nintellectuals responded\nto this paradigm with\noutcomes ranging from\nsuccessful adaptation, the\nloss of the creative spark\nor even rejection of the\nnew system. To end the\nbook, Milosz describes\nthe Soviet\u2019s analysis and\napproach to controlling\nPolish society and its\nbrutalising of the Baltic\nstates.\nDespite the fact that\nI was originally hoping\nto pick up a fictional\nwork by a Polish author,\nthe strength of Milosz\u2019s\nwriting and the insights he\nprovides made it a thoroughly enjoyable read and\na great way to learn more\nabout Poland.\nKrakow was designated a UNESCO City of Literature in 2013 // UNESCO\n\n"

Student satis-faction? Employability?\nInnovation? It doesn\u2019t\nmatter! We beat them!\nExcept it does matter.\nEnormously. According\nto a UCAS report, we\nhave overtaken Oxford\nand Cambridge to become\nthe UK\u2019s most unequal\nuniversity. We have the\nlowest proportion of\nstudents coming from\nlow-income areas in the\nUK compared to any other\nuniversity in the country.\nLet\u2019s be honest, though.\nThis was never a secret.\nWe all study or work here,\nwe don\u2019t need any report\nto tell us what we already\nknow. Imperial is a bastion\nof privileged education.\nAnd funnily enough,\nif I understand the data\ncorrectly, the report only\nfocuses on UK students,\nsorting them from low-in-come to high-income\nbased on the areas where\nthey went to school. It\nwould be interesting\nto publish some sort of\nGini coefficient based on\ndata from Home, EU and\noverseas students, even if\nthe results are more than\npredictable: if Imperial\nis the most international\nuniversity in the UK, and\nconsidering the fees paid\nby overseas students,\nit\u2019s easy to infer how\nmuch more unequal this\nuniversity might be. And\nit might get worse in the\nfuture. Brexit is coming\nvery soon, meaning EU\nstudents will probably\nstart to classify as general\noverseas students, jacking\nup their fees and removing\ntheir Student Finance.\nI don\u2019t have a problem\nwith studying surrounded\nby rich people. That\u2019s\nnot an issue in itself. It\ncan bring up some side\nissues, like the fact that if\nyou grow up in a wealthy\nbubble you can end up out\nof touch with the rest of\nsociety\u2019s problems. But\nthis is always avoidable if\nyour intentions are good\nenough and you put in a\nbit of effort.\nThe real issue is providing society with equal\nopportunities for students\nfrom every background to\nhave a shot at studying at\na world class university.\nAn interesting thought\nto consider is how the\naverage graduate job\ndestination would change\nif Imperial weren\u2019t that\nwealthy. We already\nknow banking is the top\nindustry of choice for\nImperial undergraduates,\nafter health and social\nwork (because, you know,\nmedics). Would this fact\nstay the same? On the one\nhand, one would think that\nstudents from high-in-come families are, at\nleast stereotypically, more\npressured to succeed \u2013 the\nexpectations they have to\nfulfil are higher compared\nto someone who\u2019s the first\nin her family to attend\nuniversity. Their definition of success is shaped\nby their surroundings (so\nmaybe earning less than\n\u00a340k just after graduating\nwon\u2019t feel like enough).\nOn the other hand,\ncoming from a higher-in-come family can provide\nyou a more effective\nsafety net after you\ngraduate, which means\nit\u2019s easier to refuse jobs\nyou don\u2019t want and be a\nbit more vocational, while\na lower-income student\nmight feel pressured to\ntake the first job they\ncome across.\nThese are all generalisations of the choices\nindividuals make under\ndifferent circumstances,\nbut it\u2019s always interesting\nto consider what forces\nare at play regarding\ncareer decisions when\nyou come from different\nbackgrounds.\nBut going back to the\nissue of equal opportu-nities, we hear a lot of\ntalk referring to the high\ngrades needed to enter\nImperial, and the fact\nthat, on average, schools\nfrom poorer areas tend to\nachieve lower grades. This\nis the problem with the\ndata: it\u2019s hard to decouple\nthe problem of inequality at Imperial with the\nproblem of lower grades\nfrom poorer backgrounds.\nAt first, it feels like the\nsolution lies in trying to\nimprove the conditions for\npoorer students and come\nup with strategies that\nwill improve their grades\nduring high-school. And\nthis is true to a certain\nextent. But we can\u2019t\nignore two facts: firstly,\nthat it\u2019s harder to focus\non your grades when your\nfamily is having a hard\ntime; secondly, that part\nof the value proposition\nof private schools is better\nperformance. As long as\nA-levels remain a com-petition, private schools\nwill fight to the death to\nget their students up in the\nperformance charts.\nIt makes sense to\nconsider asking for\ndifferent grade requirements depending on your\nbackground. But it\u2019s not\nthe only option we have\nto consider, and there is\na large debate to be had\nover the fairness and\neffectiveness of such an\napproach.\nbrave souls get a part time\njob to support the cost of\nliving. If they are able\nto, for example, work at\nthe Union bars and not\nhave their performance at\nuniversity being affected\nby it, they are absolute\nheroes. Just overcoming\nthe accumulation of lack\nof sleep after working\nnight shifts and being able\nto finish their coursework\nis a huge feat in itself.\nAnd yet, most students\nwouldn\u2019t welcome a\nbig campus move to a\nmore suburban area. The\nmove is already arguably\nhappening for some parts\n\u2013 postgraduates are being\nmoved in great numbers\nto the White City campus,\nand halls in Acton have\nbeen up and running for\nthree years now. It does\nseem like the longer-term\nstrategy involves moving\nas much as we can out of\ncentral London.\nBut we don\u2019t want\nto move. OK, I get it.\nIt\u2019s nice to be in South\nKensington, surrounded\nby museums and Hyde\nPark. Gazing at a lit up\nNatural History Museum\nevery night when I come\nhome from the library is a\nbeautiful sight I still can\u2019t\nget used to. But we have\nto face the hard facts. The\nprice to pay for all these\nprivileges is studying in\nthe UK\u2019s most unequal\nuniversity. And without an\neventual move of all the\ncampuses out of Central\nLondon and into areas\nsuch as Acton and White\nCity, Imperial\u2019s inequality\nwill keep increasing. The\nchoice is hard, but a more\ninclusive community with\nequal opportunities is\nsomething worth giving\nup your privilege for.\nMoving to areas like White City might help with the issue// Imperial College \u201cThe cost of\nlife in central\nLondon has\nto be driving\nsome of this\ninequality\u201d\nFor Imperial, however,\nthere are other approaches\nthat might help with the\nissue which don\u2019t involve\ngrades at all. Because it\u2019s\nnot only a grades problem.\nImperial\u2019s main campus is\nin Kensington, which is\narguably one of the most\nexpensive neighbourhoods in all of Europe.\nThere is no way that\u2019s\nnot a large deterrent when\nlow-income students\nconsider their applica-tions. To go to lectures,\nmost undergraduates will\nhave to be happy paying\ntheir \u00a3175/week or paying\na bit less, or alternately,\ncommuting for hours and\nblowing all the money on\ntransport anyway.The cost\nof life in central London\nhas to be driving some of\nthis inequality. OK, some\nAll the President\u2019s pigs \u2013 why we can\u2019t ignore\nthe issue of free choice\nThereisnodoubtthemaleattendantsofthePresident\u2019sdinnerwereengagedinlewdbehaviour.\nBut treating the hostesses as victims ignores the reality of their free choice to attend.\nCOMMENT\nShaul Rosten\nComment Writer\nP\nicture the scene:\nyou, a hot young\n20-something in\nuniversity, are\ninvited to a dinner party\nby a few members of\nthe opposite sex. They\ninstruct you to wear\nsomething revealing and\ntight, and even go so far\nas to specify what sort\nof underwear you should\nhave on. You go, and,\npredictably, they are\nflirtatious; propositioning you, touching you,\nand generally revelling\nin lewd hedonism. Are\nyou surprised? Unless\nyou were brought up\nunder a rock, I would\nimagine not.\nThis is the preface\nto the now infamous\nAnnual Presidents Club\ncharity dinner, that took\nplace on the evening of\nThursday 18th at the plush\nDorchester hotel. It was a\nmale-only event, at which\n130 \u2018hostesses\u2019 \u2013 young,\npretty girls \u2013 were given\ninstructions to dress in\na manner identical to\nthose in our hypothetical\nscenario: they were told\nto wear \u201cskimpy black\noutfits with matching underwear and high heels\u2026.\nblack sexy shoes\u201d. The\nFinancial Times went\nin undercover, exposing\nbawdy male behaviour,\nwith roaming hands, outrageous comments, and\nmultiple propositions to\nspend the night. Rightly,\nthere was a sentiment of\ndisgust at this behaviour.\nOddly, in my opinion,\nthere was also an attitude\nof shock, and an overall\ntone of victimisation on\nthe part of the women\ninvolved.\nYes, the male guests\nlargely behaved like\npigs \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that the women\nwere victims. Caroline\nDandridge, the woman\nresponsible for recruiting\nthe hostesses, informed\nthem in advance of the\nnature of the evening,\nbanning them from\nbringing phones, advising\nthem to lie to boyfriends\nabout whereabouts, and\ntelling them in advance\nabout the \u201cannoying\u201d\nmen after relaying the\naforementioned dress\ncode. Gross, I know \u2013 but\nwarning nonetheless.\nThese women knew what\nthey were doing, and\nchose to do it anyway.\nSome of them have done\nthe event for multiple\nyears, and the FT itself\nadmitted that some hostesses interviewed viewed\nthe night as \u201cfun\u201d. Even\nfor those who didn\u2019t, it is\nabsurd to want to believe\nthat they had absolutely\nno idea what they were\ngoing to be there for. They\nwere obviously and sickeningly invited as pieces\nof meat, and were treated\naccordingly. I think that\nthis behaviour, a seedy\nunderbelly of human\n(mostly male) nature, is\ndespicable, and ever since\nI first encountered people\nwith these attitudes at\nschool, I was revolted,\nand I kept my distance.\nBut the rhetoric of\nvictimisation on the part\nof the women is misplaced and exaggerated;\nit jumps on to the recent\nbandwagon of lurid men\nabusing innocent women,\nand ignores the reality of\nthe choices these women\n\u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013\nmade. Consider a different scenario: a man going\nto visit an escort, or going\ninto a strip club. Are the\nmen who generally do this\nboorish and lascivious?\nAbsolutely. Is the woman\nin question a victim? Of\ncourse not. She made\na choice to participate,\nand her actions are her\nown. I see no reason why\nthese hostesses, who, by\nall accounts, were well\ninformed, should be\ntreated as victims.\nI was also puzzled\nby the general attitude\nof surprise; that this\nbehaviour is deplorable is\nimmutably true, but that\nit is uncommon is not,\nand I expect most of us\nknow it. It is an attitude\nthat pervades many soci-eties, especially Western\nsociety, which considers\nitself enlightened and\nprogressive. Lauded\nestablishments such as\nthe Cafe De Paris, where\nwomen dance half-naked\nbut it is called cabaret,\nrather than stripping, are\nconsidered artsy, chic, and\nany other word people\nlike to use to justify their\nattendance, and to substitute \u2018salacious\u2019.\nPeople \u2013 mostly\npleasure. The adult\nentertainment industry,\nscavenging on the liberal\nrhetoric of freedom of\nexpression, instructs its\npatrons from a young age\nthat people are objects for\nyour pleasure. Whilst I am\ndisgusted by this, and the\nculture of objectification\ntaken to an extreme by\nthose attendants at the\nPresidents Club, I have\nbeen disgusted by it for\nsome time. That a bunch\nof rich men get together to\nbe gross is not a surprise\n\u2014 it\u2019s strange that people\nkeep pretending it is.\nThere are consequences\nof the choices made by\nsociety, of the things it\ndeems appropriate and\nthe boundaries it considers acceptable to cross.\nWestern culture has no\nproblem with pictures of\nhalf-naked women on the\nwalls of the tube, or the\nfront of a magazine. And\nyet, it seems shocked to\ndiscover that, predictably,\nthis encourages a culture\nof objectification and\nlewdness.\nThe Presidents Club\nDinner was an unfortunate event, demonstrating\nthat there are a good proportion of men who are\ngross, objectifying, badly\nbehaved and lecherous -but this is not news. And\nyes, the men are horrid,\nbut that doesn\u2019t make\nthe women victims, and\nif they choose to engage\nin this sort of work, they\nsit in the same boat with\na society that inculcates\nobjectification. If people\nare genuinely shocked,\nand genuinely want this\nattitude to change, perhaps\nan introspective look at\nthe practices and values\nof their society would be\nprudent.\n\u201cThe male\nguests largely\nbehaved like\npigs \u2013 that\ndoesn\u2019t mean\nthe women\nwere victims\u201d\nmen \u2013 all over the world\nbehave like this, and\nmany institutions in our\nsociety fuel them. Advertising encourages us to\nthink about people solely\nas objects, and we call\nsomeone who takes their\nclothes off to be objectified a \u2018model\u2019, cementing\nour justification of their\npresence as non-human\ngratification machines;\ntelevision is rampant\nwith over-exaggerated\nnudity and an obsession\nwith the way people\nlook; magazines show off\nshirtless men and bikinied\nwomen, using the word\n\u2018empowered\u2019 to make us\nforget that, choice or no,\nthey are presenting people\nas objects for viewing\nWe\u2019re just raisng charity money // Wikimedia\n\n"
