We\nlove an exclusive here at\nFELIX, but even we were\nrather surprised that real\nhacks from the Evening Standard\nand MailOnline took notice of a\nstory that hasn\u2019t even been on our\nfront page for two weeks or so.\nAnd bless RAG,because whatever\nyou think of them, they\u2019ve had a\nrough ride of it recently. Not only\nwas their publication removed and\ntheir arms twisted for an apology\n(always a way of getting the most\nsincere response) it\u2019s now come to\nlight that their perfectly innocent\njailbreakers were removed from a\nflight to Turkey for raising money\nfor a charity that helps Syrians. Bit\nof a case of mistaken identity, but\nthis was only realised after they'd\nbeen questioned under Schedule 7\nof the Terrorism Act 2000, which\nmeans anyone can be held by police\nat a travel hub for up to nine hours\nand be questioned without a lawyer,\neven if the police have no grounds\nA word from the Editor\nEditor-in-Chief\nGrace Rahman\nComment Editors\nTessa Davey and Vivien Hadlow\nScience Editors\nJane Courtnell and Lef Apostolakis\nArts Editors\nIndira Mallik, Jingjie Cheng and\nMax Falkenberg\nMusic and Games Editor\nCale Tilford\nFilm Editor\nFred Fyles\nWelfare Editor\nNoor Mulheron\nPuzzles Editors\nHamish Beck and Roxana Radu\nFood Editor\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nTV Editor\nSaad Ahmed\nSport Editor\nJosh O'Donnell\nTechnical Babe\nLuke Granger-Brown\nCopy Editors\nMattin Mir-Tahmasebi, Anthony\nVoyage, Henry Lloyd-Laney and\nCecily Johnson\nNews\nFeatures\nComment\nScience\nFilm\nArts\nMusic\nTV\nGames\nClubs & Societies\nHangman\nPuzzles\nSport\n3\n6\n7\n8\n12\n19\n23\n25\n26\n27\n29\n31\n30\nfor suspicion.\nThe story\u2019s a happy one though,\nbecause after being released by\narmed anti-terror police, which\nwould have made even this Great\nOrmond Street Hospital Charity\nenthusiast cry and go home, the\ngroup from RAG decided to brush\nthemselves off and hitchhike to\nPoland. Nice.\nOur story on the banning of\nboycotts may not immediately\nseem like an Imperial friendly\none \u2013 the union haven\u2019t voted to\nboycott, divest from or sanction\nanything since 1984, when the\ncollege hiked prices in the Queen\u2019s\nTower refectory (back then the\nunion also held \u2018porn film nights\u2019 in\nthe QTR though, so it was a pretty\ndifferent time). It's an important\nright of local democracies like ours\nto choose who we do and don't buy\nfrom, and without this option, local\ngovernment is weakened.\nAs the Union vs Free Speech\ndebate spreads from our letters page\nFELIX, Beit Quad,\nPrince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nPrinted by Iliffee Print Cambridge,\nWinship Road, Cambridge\nRegistered Newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 FELIX 2016\nLetters\nIn response to 'Rag Mag battle\nbecomes racism row', Issue 1626\nSir/Madam,\nAs a former RAG Chair and\nsomeone who was also heavily\nmocked in the RAG Magazine, I\nfind it disingenuous of the Union\nto suggest that the targets of RAG\u2019s\nsatire were chosen based on their\npersonal characteristics. Although\nunder my tenure as RAG Chair\nwe may have chosen not to publish\nsuch content,we must accept that as\npeople in positions of authority we\nbecome targets for public satire.\nTo suggest that the Union\nPresident was selected for criticism\non the basis of her gender seems to\nme absurd: I am the only person of\ncolour satirised in the magazine, yet\nI do not suggest that this is because\nRAG is racist.\nDiscrimination and victimisation\nare indeed truly awful facets of\nsociety that must be stamped out,\nboth on campus and in the wider\nworld. Part of doing this includes\nensuring that we only cry \u2018racist\u2019\nwhen a person of colour is offended\nif they were targeted because of their\nskin colour, and that we only shout\n\u2018sexist\u2019 when a woman is criticised\nbecause of her gender. Anything\nelse is a shameful disservice to those\nwho have truly suffered such abuse.\nBen Fernando\nRAG Chair, 2014-15\nIt's madam. You know it's\nmadam. Madam Editor, please.\nAnd yes, it obviously wasn't\nsexist. We all know it wasn't, but\nif they want to keep saying it was,\nlet them. Let's just hope it didn't\nstarve GOSH of an extra dialysis\nmachine.\n-Ed.\nIn response to 'Your union\npresident speaks on RAG mag\n'sexism'', Issue 1626\nDear Lucinda,\nI read your article last week and\nwould like to reply to some of the\naccusations directed at us.\nThe RAG mag is made to be\naccessible and funny. Thus, as the\nunion president, an article about\nyou was published as you would be\nknown by a lot of students.\nHaving read the article I do not\nbelieve you are \u2018singled out\u2019 because\nyou are a woman and in fact the\narticle also includes commentary on\nother (male) sabbaticals.\nCallingthepiecesexistundermines\ngenuine sexism. It is true that there\nis a very distorted ratio at Imperial\nand as a woman I am challenged\nby this as well. However, this does\nnot mean you can use your gender\nto make yourself the victim in a\ncase that has nothing to do with\nsexism; the article does not even\nmention your gender. Rather it is\na satire about your opinions given\nat an interview with IC radio and\non social platforms such as Twitter.\nIt criticises your statements about\nScottish Independence, the UK\nand the poor which many found\noffensive and racist.\nFurthermore, I do not believe this\narticle is justification for stopping\nwomen entering positions of power\nas I believe this article would have\nexisted whether you were male or\nfemale. As a \u2018woman in power\u2019, I am\naware that any position of power\nmakes you a figurehead and open\nto criticisms and satire from other\nstudents.This is an important aspect\nof free speech.\nThis is as true for women as it is\nfor men.\nFreedom of speech, and\nindeed freedom of the press, are\nfundamental rights as important\nas the struggle for equal rights\nacross genders. By 'banning' this\narticle and threatening the RAG\ncommittee, the Union have trodden\non these freedoms in a way that goes\nagainst the very principle of the\ncollege's legal obligation to promote\nfree speech.\nI hope you realise that because of\nthis dispute, a lot of charity money\nwas lost. We are working with three\ncharities; GOSH, Porridge and\nRice and British Refugee Councils.\nFinally, by condemning the RAG\nmag, we have lost valuable publicity\non the largest fundraising week\nat Imperial. We cannot express\nour dismay at how much was lost\nbecause of this commotion.\nI believe men and women are\nequal and just because you were\nthe subject of an article, it does not\nmean your gender was.\nKind regards,\nRAG Vice Chair of Activities,\nAlicia Graham\nWhether you think they've\nmessed up or not, we can all admit\nthat RAG have had a hard time of\nlate. Let's just hope the union has\nbeen supporting the committee\nthrough all of this as it as much\nas it supports some of its student\nsabbaticals.\n-Ed.\nPAGE 5\nfelixonline.co.uk FRIDAY 12th\nFEBRUARY 2016\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYour President speaks on RAG mag \u2018sexism\u2019\nRAG has gone too far, and should take responsibility for putting women off taking on\npositions of responsibility\nLucinda Sandon-Allum\nUnion President\nNobody banned anything. Photo Credit: RAG\nW\nho\u2019s to blame for the\ngender imbalance\nat Imperial, and\nin science and\nleadership in general? \u201cNot me\u201d,\nyou\u2019re thinking. For the vast\nmajority of you, that\u2019s correct. But\na tiny proportion of our community\nfails to recognise their role in\ncreating that awful reality.\nThe institutional culture\nsurrounding gender at Imperial is\nnot an inevitable fact of life. It is\ncreated, and sustained, by people\naround you, right here, right now. In\nthe same way that no one raindrop\nconsiders itself responsible for the\nflood, no one person considers\nthemselves responsible for the fact\nthat Imperial can be, on occasion, a\nhostile environment for women.\nNo one\nraindrop\nconsiders\nitself\nresponsible\nfor the\nflood\nBut sometimes, it becomes\npossible to pinpoint a single action\nor incident that perpetuates this\nreality. I can say with complete\nconfidence that the actions of the\nRAG committee in publishing the\nRAG mag with offensive content,\nbased on tired stereotypes about\nwomen and drawing upon aspects\nof my personal life, has directly\nled to women deciding against\ntaking up leadership roles in our\nstudent community. I know this\nbecause students that have been\nconsidering a future as Union\nPresident or one of our Deputy\nPresidents have now seen how a\ntiny minority of our students act.\nIt\u2019s clear that some individuals think\nthat tradition justifies bullying, or\nthat it\u2019s somehow acceptable not\nto challenge your peers about what\nthey say or do, or to refuse to take\npersonal responsibility.\nThese actions have led to a female\nstudent withdrawing their run for\na position of leadership, for fear of\nbeing subjected to the same abuse.If\nthis is the way a few loud voices treat\na woman in leadership, via trollish\nstereotyping and personal attacks, it\nis not a surprise that other female\nstudents have been discouraged\nfrom aiming for a leadership\nposition. And so, Imperial\u2019s gender\nimbalance lives on for another year.\nBeing an adult is about taking\nresponsibility for the consequences\nof your actions, and the individuals\ninvolved in writing that piece need\nto accept what they have done\nand the impact they have had.\nAs students we all have a duty of\nresponsibility and mutual respect.\nIf these values are not upheld and\nboundaries are crossed, the people\naccountable must confront their\nunacceptable behaviour.\nEvery student is entitled to speak\nfreely, but the RAG mag is an\nattack on this. Freedom of speech\ndoes not equate to freedom from\nconsequences. This is an issue the\nFELIX editor tackled herself in her\neditorial on the 29th\nof January.\nBy condemning the article,\nImperial College Union is in\nno way preventing RAG from\nraising money. As a previous RAG\ncommittee member and a huge\nsupporter of the society I want them\nto be as successful as possible.\nHowever, we want RAG week\nto be a success, not a scandal. It is\nperverse to argue that raising money\ncan only be successful by being cruel\nand \u2018joking\u2019 about natural tragedies.\nRAG week charities support victims\nof ill health, war and poverty. One\ncharity, Porridge and Rice, works to\nempower Kenyan women to break\nfree from the cycle of poverty \u2013 a\nworthy goal, undermined by using\nsexist stereotypes as publicity for\nfundraising.\nThe RAG mag writers must take\nfull responsibility for the reduced\npublicity they have caused for\nthis week of fundraising. They\nhave potentially discouraged\nparticipation, donations and\nsponsorship by tarnishing RAG as\na group that permits and enables\nbullying.\nWe must stop this culture that\naccepts bullying, accepts fewer\nwomen leaders, and dresses up\npersonal attacks as \u2018tradition\u2019 or\n\u2018satire\u2019. It is not acceptable for\nan article to be written to target\nan individual\u2019s personal life, and\neven more so depicting someone\u2019s\nmurder.\nI know that the majority of\nImperial students have no time for\nbullying, tasteless personal attacks,\nand gendered stereotypes masked\nas \u2018banter\u2019. I am and will always\nbe proud of the work I\u2019ve done\nas Union President to encourage\nyoung women to study science and\nto take the challenge of leadership.\nI would love to say that equality\ncan solely be achieved through\noutreach projects and publicity, but\nthey are only half the battle. The\ndeeper challenge is to confront and\nuproot prejudices and structures\nthat support and enable gendered\nattacks on women - even, or\nespecially, when disguised as \u2018banter\u2019\nor \u2018tradition\u2019. It is just cold, hard\nreality that the path to equality\nis blocked by damaging habits,\ningrained prejudices, corrosive\nbehaviours and plain old bullying\nand harassment.\nI am grateful for the support I\nhave received - from President Alice\nGast to student groups,societies and\nstaff,all appalled by the behaviour of\nthese few individuals. Together, we\nwill stand up to sexism and bullying\nwherever we see it.\nThe RAG\nmag writers\nmust\ntake full\nresponsibility\nfor the\nreduced\npublicity\nThe piece in question, which the\nMailOnline subsequently rehashed.\nto the national press and back again,\nlet\u2019s not forget the worst part of\nthis media storm: the fact that the\nEvening Standard\u2019s print edition\ncalled your beloved FELIX an\n\u201cofficial union magazine\u201d.\nTake this if you take nowt else: we\nare not the union\u2019s, and we\u2019re made\nof paper. Never have been, always\nwill be!\n\n"

Firewatch\nhas much in common with Telltale\u2019s\ngame, released by Campo Santo, a\nstudio founded by creative leads\nwho had previously worked on The\nWalking Dead.\nUnlike Telltale\u2019s point-and-click\ninspired adventure games, the\nstory unravels from a first-person\nperspective. Early marketing hinted\nat a game that looked and played\nlike a survival game, with the player\nchopping down trees and exploring\ncaves, but the player\u2019s interaction\nwith the environment is in reality,\nrather limited. Firewatch is not a\nhiking simulator.\nThe four-to-five hour story follows\na volunteer fire lookout, Henry, and\nhis relationship with his supervisor\nDelilah (they communicate via\nwalkie-talkie). The script, from\nwriter Sean Vanaman, manages to\nsuccinctly tell a story which mixes\nhumour and mystery.

Photo Credit: Firewatch, Campo Santo\nspoiling too much, Firewatch isn\u2019t\na story that is grand or fantastical;\nit\u2019s grounded in reality with a tight\nfocus on the interaction between\nits main characters. Some have\ncomplained that it is anti-climatic\nand non-cathartic, a symptom of\nthe fact that it offers something\nnew in video games \u2013 a narrative\nthat is more subtle. Gamers are\nused to instant rewards and results,\nbut Firewatch requires the player to\nthink and reflect.\nThose who can\u2019t afford a flight\nto North America to visit it\u2019s lush\nnational parks will find solace in the\nsetting of the beautiful wilderness\nof Campo Santo\u2019s debut release.The\nenvironments,rendered in the Unity\nEngine, are inspired by Yosemite\nand Yellowstone. Whether you are\nwalking around a forest, a cave or a\nlake, the game is truly breathtaking.\nThe changes in environment and\ntime of day are reflected in Chris\nRemo\u2019s moody score. When the\ngame is at it\u2019s most thrilling,\nthe soundtrack adds even more\nsuspense. It\u2019s part of the continuing\ntrend of indie games with great\nsoundtracks.\nThe only downside to an otherwise\nspectacular debut, is the game\u2019s\npoor performance on the PS4.\nNormally, I don\u2019t like focussing on\nthe technical problems with games,\nbut with Firewatch the frequent\nframerate issues are noticeable.\nHowever, play the game on PC and\nyou\u2019ll be able to fully enjoy one of\nthe best adventure games in recent\nyears.\nFirewatch is out now on\nPS4 and PC\nThe brilliant first-person adventure game from the minds behind The Walking Dead\nImperial\u2019s gaming magazine\nreturns this spring\nWe want\nwriters and\nillustrators\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFirewatch\nis not\na hiking\nsimulator\nOne of\nthe best\nadventure\ngames in\nrecent years\nthread that is unnecessary.The voice\nactors Rich Sommer and Cissy\nJones (who play Henry and Delilah\nrespectively) bring life to script in\na way that is unparalleled in video\ngames.

Overall, when\ncompared to something like My\nBeautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\nwhich featured various godfathers\nof rap such as Wu Tang members\nRZA and Raekwon as well as Jay Z,\nThe Life of Pablo has a more modern\nand fresh feel. Kanye\u2019s mastermind\nfor production is seen in flashes of\nabsolute brilliance such as the outro\nto \u2018Famous\u2019, the explosive gospel\nsections of \u2018Ultralight Beam\u2019 and\nthe short intro to \u2018Wolves\u2019.

Ultimately\nI do not see this as a bad thing, as\nI have always been less of a fan of\nKanye\u2019s concept albums such as 808s\nand Yeezus. As it stands, The Life\nof Pablo is a work of energetic yet\nsoulful expression \u2013 Kanye doesn\u2019t\nhold back and this is where his\npassion shines through.

And, despite\nall the drama, The Life of Pablo is\nabsolutely phenomenal.\n\u2018Ultralight Beam\u2019opens the album.\nThis gospel banger, with its church\nchoir,organs and auto tune is already\nmany people\u2019s favourite of the\ntracklist as is Chance the Rapper\u2019s\nverse.In my opinion,it\u2019s the best rap\nalbum opener since Nas\u2019 \u2018NY State\nof Mind\u2019 or GZA\u2019s \u2018Liquid Swords\u2019.\nThe track is anthemic perfection.\nListening to the rest of The Life\nof Pablo, it then becomes clear\nthat Kanye started as he wished to\nproceed.Two other stand out tracks\ninclude the haunting and nocturnal\n\u2018Wolves\u2019, and \u2018Father Stretch My\nHands Pt. 1 & 2\u2019, which are both\nvery reminiscent of Atlantan\nrappers such as Future, Migos and\nKanye West causes tidal waves with his eighth album\nKanye\nseems to\nbe drawing\ninspiration\nrather than\ngiving it\nMetro Boomin with their trippy\nautotuned vibes.\nProducer-wise, if one said\nthat Yeezus was made great by\ncollaboration with Rick Rubin and\nMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\nby Jeff Bhasker then Chance\nshould be considered the master\ncollaborator on this record. As\nalways (to quote Jayson Greene)\nKanye \u201cmakes people you don\u2019t care\nabout sound fantastic and people\nyou do care about sound immortal\u201d.\nReturning faces from other projects\ninclude Kid Cudi who features in\n\u2018Father Stretch My Hands Pt.1\u2019 as\nThe Life of Pablo really wasn\u2019t\nworth the hype (sorry Ben).And Mr.\nWest certainly isn\u2019t happy with all\nthe critics who have dared to suggest\nit isn\u2019t the god-like masterpiece he\nhad hoped (Pitchfork gave it a 9.0 so\nI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s complaining).\nI guess life\u2019s hard being married to\na businesswoman who earned $52.5\nmillion in 2015. Kanye needs some\nhelp, and he needs it now. His art\nmight be great, but it\u2019s not worth\nmore than building schools for the\nimpoverished.\nHe wanted the world to\nknow his struggle\nTakes so hot they are literally hell\nCALE TILFORD\n\n"

For the first\ntime, Gate publicity maestro Tash\nBrown looks a tad worried. She\nneedn\u2019t be.Gate\u2019s work is exactly the\nkind of thing I wish we had more\nof here at Imperial. Passionately\ndone and served up with a massive\ndollop of generosity on the side,\nGate Theatre is one big cosy theatre\nfamily \u2013 and y\u2019all are invited.(Check\nout its outreach programme!) Kidd,\nfresh from rehearsals, bubbles with\nthe same outspoken friendliness,\nand we sit down to talk Ireland,\nImperial and art.\nFELIX: After working with the\nYoung Vic, and now here at The\nGate, are you starting to feel more\npart of the furniture in London?\nBK: [Laughs] I don\u2019t think anyone\nfeels part of the furniture in London\n\u2013 it\u2019s too big!\nFELIX: Is it more bread and\nbutter in London and fun in\nDublin? How does your work with\nDeadCentre fit in?\nBK: London is much more of a\nbubble. It\u2019s commerical. Directors\nlearn to get 4-star reviews from the\nGuardian, and Simon Stephens is\nSimon Stephens because of West\nEnd transfers [Laughs]. There\u2019s\nno such thing as famous people in\nDublin. It\u2019s a lot more informal,\nmore like a family, more \u201cWhat are\nyou going to f*** up next?\u201dThe most\nimportant people will just pop along\nto your show. Here, it\u2019s hierarchical.\nThere are more stakeholders, and\nyou get a lot more feedback \u2013\nsomeone (normally a well educated\nwhite man) who\u2019ll say \u201cWell done,\nyou\u2019re clever enough\u201d. But that\u2019s a\nhuge support, in the sense that you\nhave someone there legitimising\nwhat you do.\nFELIX: This is your first play\nat the Gate, and an international\npremiere, too. What made you pick\nup this script?\nBK: Actually, it was the other\nway around! This is my first time\ndirecting something at the Gate...\nBen Williams\nArts Writer\nI\u2019d tried (unsuccessfully) to apply\nfor a number of things, and got\nrejected. As a director, it\u2019s a dream\nwhen someone rings you up \u2013 that\nnever happens! I don\u2019t actually\nknow how many Nina [Nina Segal,\nIn the Night Time playwright] and\nChris [Christopher Haydon, Artistic\nDirector at The Gate] interviewed,\nbut I think they had me in mind\nwhen they were thinking of putting\non the play.\nFELIX: A friend of mine saw it\nand compared it to lyrics. To me it\nreads like a kind of epic poem. It\u2019s\none big stream of consciousness,and\nthere isn\u2019t a single stage direction in\nthe whole piece. How hard has it\nbeen to get that sense of flow across,\nand keep up some tension?\nBK: It\u2019s a hard play. My first\nquestion when I read the script was\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t this a short story?\u201d It\u2019s\ndefinitely a very langauge-focused\nplay. I don\u2019t really do \u2018creeping\ntension\u2019 or anything like that. I\nthink there\u2019s a million different\nways you can direct things. There\u2019s\nnot necessarily one set way, I just\ntry to be explorative and flexible.\nA director should generate ideas \u2013\nyou can have a rough feel of how it\nshould be but you need to be open to\nthe idea that something might have\nto change. For me, the set design,\nthe production is very important. I\ncan have five or six competing ideas\n\u2013 the set is the thing that has final\nchoice \u2013 when it has to become an\nactual, physical thing.\nFELIX: How important has it\nbeen to have that link with the\nwriter [Nina Segal]?\nBK: That\u2019s a very important\nrelationship. Nina is just starting\nout and she has a whole wonderful\ncareer of writing ahead of her. You\nsee she\u2019s very discreet \u2013 I think even\nif she thought we were f***king it\nup she wouldn\u2019t say. She\u2019s confident\nenough in her writing to trust us,\nand that someone will get it right,\neventually!\nFELIX: How difficult was the\ncasting? I mean, the minute I read\nthe script, I immediately thought\nthat you need someone who\u2019s going\nthrough this... [Just having kids]\nBK: [Laughs] It\u2019s bizarre to think\nhow we would have made the play\nwithout someone in the production\nhaving kids. I don\u2019t have kids, no\none at the Gate has kids... If Alex\n[Alex Waldmann, \u2018Man\u2019] hadn\u2019t had\nkids I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d have\ndone! We cast it as naturally as\npossible. These are two people who\ncould believably be the people in the\nscript.... above all, I think you cast\ntalent, and you cast people who are\ninterested in the role.\nFELIX: So, the curtain comes\ndown on the first night. How am I\nchanged?\nBK: I don\u2019t know... hopefully\nyou\u2019ll laugh and cry and think\ndifferently about the universe. It\u2019s\nabout creating a space for someone\nto have an emotional journey.\n([Laughs] \u201cThey better f**cking\ncry!\u201d) I don\u2019t think people will come\naway and want to be this or that. No\none cares what a play is about \u2013 they\ncare what a play\u2019s going to be like.\nFELIX: What drives you as a\ndirector?\nBK: I want to get to the point\nwhere you can see it again and get\nthat same feeling you felt when you\nfirst saw it. I want to introduce an\naudience to that thrill that I had in\nmy head.\nFELIX: Let\u2019s say that science\nis essentially about trying to make\nsense of the world. Isn\u2019t that what\nart\u2019s for? Why is there such a big\ngulf between the two?\nBK: There\u2019s this cultural cringe.\nIt\u2019s quite easy I think for a scientist\nto come to the theatre, to go to a\ngallery. It\u2019s not easy for someone\non the arts side to go the other way\naround.This idea of the Renaissance\nman has been lost; we\u2019re all\nspecialists \u2013 and that\u2019s a shame. But\nsome people would disagree with\nyou. Perhaps the point of art is to\nsay that the world mostly doesn\u2019t\nmake sense. Art tries to dance\naround the gaps where we don\u2019t\nknow \u2013 it\u2019s about God and death. I\nreckon as a scientist, the only reason\nyou get out of bed in the morning is\nthat you have the belief that there\u2019s\nthis idea of progress. What if there\nis no endpoint?\nFELIX: So you wouldn\u2019t try to\nbridge those gaps? It\u2019s not nature\nthat made these boundaries...\nBK: I suppose there isn\u2019t a\ndifference between Chemistry and\nemotions. I definitely wouldn\u2019t\nsupport the idea of forcing all\nphysicists to do ballet. But some\nof the things we\u2019re doing with\nDeadCentre are trying to challenge\nthe way that the audience interacts\nwith the theatre. It\u2019s not just a\ncase of come in, sit down, watch\nsomething. For example, there\u2019s\none show we\u2019re doing where the\naudience has headphones and can\nhear a directors commentary on the\nshow, while the show is happening.\nWe\u2019re trying to make it more of a\nconversation with the audience.\nFELIX: What advice would you\ngive someone trying to get involved\nin directing?\nBK: Do all the things I didn\u2019t do! I\nkind of just fell into everything, fell\ninto \u2018stuff\u2019. I came late (after trying\nto be an actor), and I was jaded,\nworried \u201cI was too old for this\u201d.\nDevelop your taste, see as much\ntheatre as possible. Talk to as many\npeople as possible.Don\u2019t be afraid of\nknocking on doors (or some public\nschool boy will get there before\nyou). Above all, don\u2019t get obsessed\non fixed paths \u2013 theatre isn\u2019t just\none thing.\nBen Kidd, the new kid on The Gate\u2019s block. Photo Credit: The Gate Theatre\nIn the Night Time. Photo Credit: Bill Knight\nFELIX asks Gate Theatre\u2019s new director Ben Kidd about directing and his latest work\nT\nhe Winter\u2019s Tale is a\ntrue winter\u2019s delight. It is\nperformed at the Globe\nTheatre, but fear not\nas it isn\u2019t an outdoor getting-wet-standing-in-the-pit affair, rather\nyou are welcomed to an enchanting\ntheatretuckednextdoor,therecently\nbuilt Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.\nThe Playhouse is a replica of the\ntheatre that Shakespeare\u2019s plays\nwere written for, with no modern\ngiveaways in sight.It is intimate and\nsnug; the small stage is surrounded\nby the limited audience and entirely\nlit by candlelight,giving a sense that\nyou are peering into someone else\u2019s\nliving room. Along with the rich\nand vibrant characters, the musical\nquartet and the intimacy you feel\nwarm and cosy, enough to brighten\nup even the dreariest of winter\nnights.\nOn entering the theatre I heard\nmurmuring that we were in for a 3\nhour ordeal, however even if it was\nit definitely didn\u2019t feel like it. The\nWinter\u2019s Tale follows the (not too\ncomplicated) story of the jealous\nand suspicious King Leontes\nwho accuses his wife, the serene\nHermione, of adultery with his\nchildhood friend, another king. The\ntale follows the consequences of his\nsudden jealousy and the tragedy and\nrather fortunate events that follow.\nThe first half is a little slow\nand riddled more with the usual\nShakespearean outpourings of\nemotions, speech and monologues,\nhowever it is not too hard to follow\nand you feel a certain sense of\nsatisfaction for keeping up.\nAfter a very sincere first half\nthe second half picks up the pace,\nbeginning with a jester style\ncharacter who carries this comic\nfeel through to the end.The morose\natmosphere before is dissipated with\ndeclarations of love and a surprising\namount of singing and dancing.\nThis juxtaposition of tragedy and\nthen comedy brings the play to life.\nThe acting as expected was\nimpressive. Not particularly\nexceptional, but good enough. They\nmade good use of the stage, often\nwalking through the audience and\neven at one point jumping into the\ncrowd and squeezing themselves\nonto the seats.The seats were a slight\ninconvenience as they are cushioned\nbenches, so unless you get a seat at\nthe rear you have to support your\nown back, making it a little difficult\nto get comfortable. But any notion\nof discomfort is soon forgotten\nwhen you get lost in the play. The\nending is slightly bizarre, but there\nare enough good times to make up\nfor it.\nOn the whole it is a unique and\nenjoyable experience, possibly more\nso for the charming atmosphere\nthan the plot.\nThe Winter\u2019s Tale is on at the Globe\nuntil 22nd\nApril\nThe Globe\u2019s The Winter\u2019s Tale is striking in its clever use of an intimate atmosphere\nCalling all writers, artists, photographers and creators of art!\nIt is halfway through the term and we would like you to start thinking about what you might want to submit to our termly\nPHOENIX publication.

And now,\nseven years on, Guadagnino is back,\nand has brought Swinton along for\nthe ride, in his remake of Jacques\nDeray\u2019s 1969 work La Piscine.\nSwinton is Marianne Lane, a\nworld-touring, glitter-coated rock\nstar, presumably based on a Bowie\narchetype. Following an injury to\nher vocal cords, she has retreated\nto a private villa in the Strait of\nSicily for rest and relaxation, with\nher long-term boyfriend Paul\nin tow (Matthias Schoenaerts).\nUnfortunately, they are tracked\ndown by Harry (Ralph Fiennes), a\nrecord producer and old flame of\nMarianne\u2019s; he brings along newly-discovered daughter, Penelope\n(Dakota Johnson), and they settle\ndown to an uneasy holiday.\nAll four leads are excellent in their\nroles. As perhaps the only character\nwho could possibly be construed\nas \u2018realistic\u2019, Schoenaerts brings a\nsense of groundedness to his Paul.\nSwinton faces a challenging role\nin that Marianne can for the most\npart only communicate in whispers,\nbut as usual her immense physical\npresence comes to the fore. As\nHarry, Fiennes dominates all the\nscenes he\u2019s in \u2013 dancing around the\nliving room to The Rolling Stones,\ndiving naked into the pool, nearly\ndriving his car over a cliff; whenever\nhe enters the frame it become \u2018The\nHarry Show\u2019. Continuing on from\nhis star-turn in Wes Anderson\u2019s\nGrand Budapest Hotel, A Bigger\nSplash sees Fiennes expanding his\noeuvre into broad comedy.\nBut the real discovery here is\nDakota Johnson, best known\nthus far for her work in the\nflaccid Fifty Shades adaptation; as\nPenelope she radiates a true sexual\ncharisma, mixing the ing\u00e9nue\nand the deviant in a chimerical\nbeast of a role. Manipulative and\ndevious, the interactions between\nher and Marianne bring to mind\nthe sparring between Charlotte\nRampling and Ludivine Sagnier in\nFrancois Ozon\u2019s Swimming Pool,\nanother psychosexual drama deeply\nindebted to Deray.\nGuadagnino carries over some of\nthe trademark features that left their\nmark on I Am Love: his creeping use\nof the slow-zoom shot; frequent\njump-cuts; and his propensity to\nhave food stand in for dialogue.\nWhile the latter technique fitted in\nquite well with the plot of his last\nfilm (Swinton\u2019s character\u2019s lover\nis a chef), here there are instances\nwhere it is (figuratively) over-egged.\nWe have Marianne being shown\nby an old nonna how to prepare\nDakota Johnson as Penelope, in the sun-drenched erotic thriller A Bigger Splash. Photo Credit: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nThe real\ndiscovery\nhere is\nDakota\nJohnson as\nPenelope\nA Bigger Splash fails to make an impact\nDespite the best efforts of Swinton and co, Luca Guadagnino's latest dissapoints\npure white ricotta, Harry handling\na grotesquely oversized hunk of\nparmesan at a tense dinner. In fact,\none of Penelope\u2019s first actions is to\npeel and bite into a ripe fig in a way\nthat would make Angela Carter\nblush.\nThe island setting, too, feels like a\nmisstep. A barren island that admits\nno beauty, A Bigger Splash resists\nthe best efforts of cinematographer\nYorick Le Saux; there are some\nbeautiful scenes shot at night or\nsunset, but in all the daytime scenes\nthe hot Mediterranean sun bleaches\nall life out of the film. It\u2019s another\nunfortunate contrast to I Am Love,\non which Le Saux also worked;\nwhile that film manages to capture\nthe frantic energy of Milan and the\nsun-dappled splendour of Sanremo,\nwith A Bigger Splash he can only\ndo so much with the setting.\nFurthermore, there is the bizarre\nchoice to set all the action against\na backdrop of the current European\nrefugee crisis: towards the middle of\nthe film we start to hear news reports\nof drownings near Lampedusa, and\nPenelope is ogled by a group of men\nduring a hike into the mountains\n(it is perhaps worth pointing out\nthat they are the only non-white\ncharacters encountered in the\nfilm, and have no lines). It is very\nunclear what point this is supposed\nto serve. Are we supposed to feel\namused at the irrelevant worries\nof the rich and famous being cast\ninto shadow by \u2018real\u2019 struggles? Or\nare the characters supposed to be\npsychologically trapped, just as the\nrefugees are physically detained?\nThe overall effect is just to leave a\nsense of confusion on the screen,\nand a bad taste in our mouths.\nStanding on its own, A Bigger\nSplash is a solid film; competently\ndirected, well acted, and \u2013 despite\ncertain missteps \u2013 delivering a\npowerful psychological impact.\nHowever, given Guadagnino's last\nfilm, it comes as a disappointment.\nI Am Love was like a beautifully\npresented plate in a Michelin-star\nrestaurant \u2013 sumptuous, vibrant,\nand delectable. In contrast, A Bigger\nSplash is much like the volcanic rock\nupon which it is set \u2013 unnerving,\nhostile, and ultimately desolate.\nF\nrancis Ford Coppola\u2019s\nGodfather films (excluding\nThe Godfather III \u2013 no one\nlikes the third one, let\u2019s\nbe real) are often considered to be\ntwo of the greatest films ever made.\nIn fact, they sit nicely below The\nShawshank Redemption\u2019s top spot\non IMDb\u2019s Top 100 Films list.\nHowever, The Godfather is not the\nbe-all and end-all. One must never\nforget that the \u2018gangster film\u2019 genre\nis rich in quality, and can branch out\nfrom the standard mid-1900s Mafia\nsetting:\nOnce Upon a Time in\nAmerica (1984)\nOnce Upon a Time in America is\nthe first in the trilogy of films by\nSergio Leone, which also contains\nthe classic Once Upon a Time in\nthe West. The fact that this feature\nfollows the entire lives of a group of\nJewish ghetto youths and their rise\nto power in New York means that\nit is notoriously long. I\u2019ll be straight\nthough, unless you\u2019ve experienced\nthe 251 minute extended director\u2019s\ncut you have no right to complain\nabout the length.\nReservoir Dogs (1992)\nTarantino\u2019s feature-length debut\nmovie \u2013 and, in my opinion, one\nof his best \u2013 is an intricate, stylish,\ntheatrical story set almost entirely\nin one location. The film is such a\nclassic and many of its scenes so\niconic that it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve already\nhad countless Tarantino fanboys\ninsist you watch it already. Why in\nGod\u2019s name haven\u2019t you then?\nHard Boiled (1992)\nAsian crime dramas are the\nspiritual cousins to the classic\nAmerican Mafioso film. Be it an\nartistic and violent Yakuza drama or\ngritty 90s Hong Kong action romp,\nthe Eastern film industry has many\ncontenders for critic\u2019s top spots.\nHard Boiled focuses on tough-as-nails cop Yun-Fat Chow drives the\nnarrative.For reference,Body count:\n307.\nBEN COLLIER\nThe top three\ngangster films\nthat aren\u2019t\nThe Godfather\nA Bigger Splash\nDir: Luca Guadagnino.

Starring: Tilda\nSwinton, Ralph Fiennes, Dakota\nJohnson, Matthias Schoenaerts. 124\nminutes.\nDoc corner: ExitThrough the Gift Shop\nBen Collier\nFilm Writer\nL\nast week we had The\nImposter \u2013 a gripping\ndocumentary following\na bizarre case of identity\nfraud and murder. The film was\nheavy with recreation scenes and\nutilised them to such an extent\nthat it blurred the lines between\ndocumentary and feature drama.\nThe documentary of choice this\nweek continues the theme of mixing\nreality and fiction. The difference\nhere is that it's kind of the point.\nIn reality, Exit Through the Gift\nShop may not even be allowed to\nfeature in this section, as it\u2019s not\nreally clear if it can really be called a\n\u2018documentary\u2019.\nThe narrative presented to us\n(should we take the film\u2019s word\nfor it) is that an eccentric amateur\nfilmmaker Thierry Guetta set out to\nlocate and document a number of\npopular street artists, including the\ncontroversial graffiti artist Banksy.\nGuetta was interested in filming\nthe creative process, \u2013 telling many\nprominent \u2018street artists\u2019 that he\nis making a feature documentary\nwhen, in reality, he has no intention\nof editing his footage.Banksy,as I\u2019m\nsure you know, is a fan of anonymity\nand as it turns out eventually turns\nthe cameras back on Thierry.\nIn the end Banksy is credited as\nthe director of this film, taking the\ncreative reigns to tell his own story\nwith Guetta\u2019s supposed \u2018mountain\nof video cassettes\u2019 to hand. The\nfinal parts of the film describe how\nBanksy convinces Thierry himself\nto become a street artist under the\ntitle of \u2018Mr. Brainwash\u2019. \u2018M.B.W.\u2019\ngoes onto make millions off the\noh-so-trendy art crowd of LA. The\nissue here is how much of this story\nwe believe, and personally, I don\u2019t\nbelieve any of it. In this way, whilst\nthe documentation of the other\nstreet artists is factual, Banksy quite\nclearly fabricated this character of\nGuetta to tell his own story. I\u2019m\njust not massively interested in\ndebating its legitimacy.\nTo the film\u2019s credit, there is\na nice blend of sweet and sour\nhere with humour and political\nsatire both featuring heavily. The\nfilm shines in its first act which\ngives us the backstory of various\nprominent street artists such\nas \u2018Space Invader\u2019 and Shepard\nFairey. Also interesting is how\nthe film explores the idea that the\nmost important thing in the art\nworld is not the quality of your\npieces but rather your ability to\ncreate hype. Banksy, through this\ncharacter of Guetta, exposes how\ncomfortably commercial street\nart has become.\nThe fact remains that he\u2019s so\nunfathomably annoying that\nyou\u2019ll want to reach into your\nTV and strangle him by the third\nact. If Banksy makes another film\nwithout the pretentious nonsense\nor over-complications, I\u2019ll make\nsure to give it a watch.\nDeadpool\nDir: Tim Miller. Script: Rhett\nReese,Paul Wernick.Starring: Ryan\nReynolds, Morena Baccarin, Gina\nCarano,T. J. Miller. 108 minutes.\nC\nritics have been\npredicting comic book\nmovie fatigue ever since\nMarvel\u2019s The Avengers\nback in 2012, yet audiences are\nturning out in droves to increasingly\nstale comic based blockbusters.\nMany had hoped that Deadpool,\nthe eighth installment in the\nX-Men series and the directorial\ndebut of Tim Miller, would provide\nsomething radically new.The source\nmaterial from which it could have\nborrowed is vast and diverse, but\nwriters Rhett Reese and Paul\nWernick have instead delivered\na formulaic origin story and a\nforgettable villain. Whilst it might\nbegin mid-action, it spends far too\nmuch time in flashbacks to the\nprotagonist's past: Wade Wilson, a\nmercenary for hire, unlocks mutant\npowers in an attempt to cure his\nterminal cancer and becomes\nDeadpool. The film follows his\nattempts to hunt down the man who\ndisfigured and tortured him in an\nexperimental weapons programme.\nRyan Reynolds, who plays the\ntitular antihero, gives a performance\nthat perfectly captures Deadpool\u2019s\nwacky sensibilities. The ensemble\ncast, however are mixed: as\nWeasel, Wilson\u2019s best friend, T.\nJ. Miller plays the same character\nhe plays in HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley;\nMorena Baccarin provides much\nneeded romance as Vanessa, and\nher relationship with Wilson,\nalthough accelerated (through a\nsequence of interesting sex scenes),\nis surprisingly believable for a\ncomic book film. Two lesser-known\nX-Men make welcome appearances\nin the film: Colossus (Stefan\nKapi\u010di\u0107) and Negasonic Teenage\nWarhead (Brianna Hildebrand),\nproviding counter-balance to\nDeadpool\u2019s crude humour.\nComics readers will know that\nWade Wilson can be a complex and\ninteresting character; unfortunately,\nDeadpool offers none of this.\nUnnecessarily obscene, always dark,\nand never clever, the self-aware\ncomedy and repeated breaking of the\nfourth wall are an attempt to appeal\nto the worst kind of demographic.\nFull of obscure references and\nawful jokes about topics ranging\nfrom genitals to murder, Deadpool\nis nothing more than the Reddit of\nmovies.\nCALE TILFORD\nRyan Reynolds as wise-cracking, fourth-wall-breaking, uninspiring Deadpool Photo Credit: 20th Century Fox\nSuper-cool 'artist' Banksy.

Photo Credit: Wikipedia\nH\nong Kong experienced\na fiery Chinese New\nYear as protesters and\nthe police clashed on\nthe night of the 7th\nof February.\nWith 130 people injured and 67\npeople arrested, one might be\nsurprised to find out that the riots\nstarted with fishballs,a popular local\nsnack that could be bought from\nstreet vendors.\nDuring the Chinese New Year,\nas many restaurants close early,\nsome streets become informal food\nmarkets, populated by hawkers\nthat sell curry fishballs, imitation\nshark\u2019s fin soup, and other street\nfoods. Many of these hawkers are\ndoing business illegally, as they\nhaven\u2019t obtained a licence from the\nFood and Environmental Hygiene\nViolent\nclashes\nbroke out\nand the city\ndescended\ninto\ndarkness\nDepartment (FEHD).In fact,a vast\nmajority of Hong Kong\u2019s hawkers\nare illegal as new hot food licences\nhaven\u2019t been distributed since 1980,\ndue to difficulties in managing the\nsafety and cleanliness of the food\nstalls.\nThe FEHD are known to be\nrather lax regarding these offences\nduring the Chinese New Year, as\nthe informal markets are traditional\nduring this holiday. However, this\nyear, the FEHD decided that New\nYear\u2019s Eve would be a prime time\nto enforce the regulations. The\nnews spread and groups organised\nprotests on social media against the\nFEHD in the Mong Kok area.\nThe FEHD were helpless against\nlarge groups of protesters, and the\npolice were called in, leading to\na standoff between the two sides.\nViolent clashes broke out and the\ncity descended into darkness and\nchaos. The violent protesters threw\nbricks and other items at the police,\nphysically assaulted officers, and set\ncars and mounds of trash alight.\nOn the flip side, police officers\nwere using pepper spray, attacking\nprotesters with their batons, and\nthrowing bricks back towards the\ncrowd. Members of the press were\nalso injured in the skirmishes. The\nnight climaxed with gunshots,\nfired towards the sky by a traffic\npolice officer, and as the sun rose\nthe protesters retreated. In the days\nthat followed, people were arrested\nfor rioting and obtaining access to a\ncomputer with intent to commit an\noffence or with a dishonest intent.\nThe night left the city in shock.\nAs politicians awoke, parties\nbegan to swiftly condemn the\nviolence. Government officials\nstated that the riots had nothing\nto do with localist movements, the\ngovernment\u2019s approval rating, or\nhawker regulations. Supporters of\nthe protest condemned the police\nforce\u2019s actions with others coming\nto the support of the police force,\nsaying that the police were, in fact,\ntoo restrained.\nSupporters of the protest zero\nin on the fact that fishballs led\nto bullets and police brutality,\nwhile those against looked at the\ninjuries sustained by the force and\nthe helplessness of some under-equipped officers.\nPulling the camera back, we see\nthat the clashes escalated step-by-step and the violence from both sides\nwas irrational and unreasonable.But\nmore importantly, the fishballs were\njust the final straw for the protestors,\npushing them towards violence. We\nare looking at a city that has slowly\nbut surely fallen from its place as the\nnumber one international financial\ncentre in Asia to a political mess\nwith a steadily worsening economic\nissues. Sure, this may be the result\nof the rapidly growing Chinese\neconomy and changes in the sociopolitical environment, but the\ngovernment is not without fault.\nThe executive branch of Hong\nKong has no accountability to\nthe general public, because it is\nappointed by a small group of\nelectors. The Legislative Council is\ncontrolled by the pro-establishment\nparties, with 30 out of 70 of the seats\nbeing functional constituencies,\nallowing small groups to have\nimmense voting power. Time after\ntime, the Hong Kong government\nhas continued to push unwanted\npolicies, heedless of public outcry.\nSome examples include: The\nMainland and Hong Kong\nCloser Economic Partnership\nArrangement, The National\nEducation issue, the police response\nto Occupy Central, the shameful\nfaux universal suffrage plan, the\nattempted implementation of\nsimplified Chinese and Mandarin\nas the main language for education,\nthe missing booksellers incident,the\nforced appointment of the Hong\nKong University Council chairman,\nthe push for the Copyright\n(Amendment) Bill 2014 are all\nexamples of enforced policies for\nthe interested reader.\nBut Government officials believe\nthat this Fishball Riot has nothing\nto do with their actions? They may\nbe acting clueless now, but let\u2019s\ndispel once and for all the fiction\nthat the Hong Kong government\ndoesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing. It\nknows exactly what it\u2019s doing.\nThey are undertaking an effort to\nchange the city, and to make it more\nlike China. A significant portion\nof the public (particularly the\nyounger generation) are tired of the\nmainlanders flooding the streets of\nTsim Sha Tsui, buying up property\nand causing baby formula shortages\nwhile the government does nothing\nbut encourage them. Something\nneeds to change, and in my opinion,\nthe first step would be to remove\nthe system of electors and institute\nuniversal suffrage.\nNo one is saying that true\nuniversal suffrage would solve every\nproblem in the city and make it a\nmagical fairy land with a 420%\nGDP growth per year and a happy\npopulation. However it would make\nthe government accountable to its\npeople,and perhaps these seemingly\nthoughtless actions, and the riots\nthat follow, would happen less\noften.\n\n"

Where can you pray when\nyou\u2019ve only got five minutes?\nISoc\nWriters\nM\nuslims are probably\none of the easiest\ngroups of people\nto identify from\nthe way we dress, girls being more\nobvious than guys. As Muslims we\nfind that there\u2019s a lot of confusion\nabout why we do certain things and\npeople speculate because they\u2019re too\nscared to ask in case we get offended.\nContrary to what the media might\ntell you,1 in 5 of us don\u2019t sympathise\nwith a certain group of people. In\nfact we\u2019d be more than happy to tell\nyou why we don\u2019t eat all Haribos or\nwhy I didn\u2019t join the Pub Crawl at\nthe start of the year. For those too\nshy to question us directly, here\u2019s a\nselection of questions Muslims on\ncampus have been asked in the past.\nWe pray five times a day wherever\nwe can and nip out whenever we\nfind an opportunity during labs. If\nthere\u2019s only ten minutes before the\nlecture starts it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019m going\nto trek it to the Prayer Room (in\nPrince\u2019s Gardens) and make it back\nin time. We pretty much disappear\nto anywhere we can find a small,\npeaceful space on campus. It also\nhas to be clean, so along with that\nportable charger, a travel prayer\nmat can also be quite handy. This\nincludes lecture theatres, empty\nrooms, secret corridors and between\nYes, you\nprobably\ndid see me\nawkwardly\nmassaging\nmy foot\nbookshelves. Basically anywhere\nthat won\u2019t cause an inconvenience\nto anybody else. One Islamic\nSociety member made it her aim to\npray in every building atleast once\nbefore she graduates. On Fridays\n(holiest day of the week), we pray in\ncongregation in Beit wherewe even\nhave speakers set up to deliver the\nsermon.\nUnfortunately we don\u2019t have\n\u201caesthetically pleasing\u201d waterproof\nhijabs yet (swimming caps don\u2019t\ncount) and it\u2019s harder to shampoo\nwith a scarf covering your hair. In\nall seriousness though, our hijabs\nare only worn in front of unrelated\nmen.We can take them off when it\u2019s\na girls only setting or the men are\nclose relations.\nBefore prayer we have to wash\nour hands, face, ears, arms and feet.\nSo yes, you probably did see me\nawkwardly massaging my foot.\nThat would be the call to prayer.\nIt\u2019s the same as the one you might\nget woken up by on a trip to Turkey\nor Egypt.\nMany of us learn to read and recite\nQur\u2019anic Arabic and sometimes\naccidentally drop phrases such as\n\u201cinsha Allah\u201d, \u201cmasha Allah\u201d and\n\u201cAlhamdulillah\u201d into standard\nEnglish conversations. Force of\nhabit. They mean \u201cGod-willing\u201d,\n\u201cGod has willed it\u201dand \u201cPraise be to\nGod\u201d. We also greet other muslims\nwith \u201cSalaam\u201d or \u201cAssalaamu\nalaikum\u201d or if you\u2019ve got that extra\nbit of breath, \u201cAssalaamu alaikum\nwa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh\u201d.\nThey all mean peace be unto you\nand the last means \u201cpeace, mercy\nand blessings of Allah be upon you\u201d.\nBut no, other than that not all of us\nare native Arabic speakers and so\nfor many of us, this is the most we\nspeak. However, many non-Arabic\nspeaking muslims learn the language\nto enhance their understanding of\nthe Qur\u2019an. Not all Arabic words\nhave an English equivalent so it\u2019s\nbetter to try and understand things\nin context.\nDates for next week\nMonday 22nd\nFebruary\nDiscover Islam Exhibitions in\nSAF and Sherfield\n\u201cIslam\u2019s Contribution to\nHumanity\u201d by Adnan Rashid\nWednesday 24th\nFebruary\nDiscover Islam Week Free Lunch\nThursday 25th\nFebruary\nDiscover Islam Exhibitions in\nSAF and Sherfield\n\u201cTommy Evans: The Liberation\nof A-Man\u201d Poetry Event by\nBritish Hip Hop Artist\nWhere do you go to pray\nat Imperial?\nDo you shower with your\nscarf on?\nDid I just see you\nwashing yourself in the\ntoilets?\nMate, what is that\nalarm?\nDo you all speak Arabic?\nCan you hear properly\nwith that scarf on your\nhead?\nA travel\nprayer mat\ncan also be\nquite handy\nSorry, could you repeat the\nquestion please?\nReligion can be a sensitive topic\nwhich is why many tend to avoid\nasking questions.

Another\nNorthumbria goal quickly put\nthem back in front, but TJ, Ramon\nFernandez, responded with a great\nshot from far out to end the first\nquarter 2-2.\nAs the second quarter progressed,\ngrowing home support pushed\nNorthumbria into the lead and\nby the third quarter they had\naccumulated a four goal advantage.\nRunning out of time, four goals\ndown, and a long way from home,\nthings weren\u2019t looking good for\nImperial. A time out was called to\ngather the team before the game\nslipped out of reach.\nImperial came out of the time out\ncomposed and determined, quickly\nscoring three goals in a row with no\nresponse from Northumbria thanks\nto solid defence and great saves from\ngoalkeeper Maurice Zard.The third\nquarter continued and Northumbria\nmanaged to regain their lead leaving\nthe score 10-8.\nThetalkgoingintothefinalquarter\nstressed the importance of keeping\nour defence strong, and a reminder\nof how important the match was\nsent the tired Imperial team out\nwith a new lease of life. Impeccable\ndefending left Northumbria\nfrustrated and prevented them from\nscoring a single goal in the last\nquarter despite having three man-up attacks. Still two goals down\nwith only three minutes left on the\nclock Maurice made another top\nsave, passed the ball down the right\nwing to Alberto Lauri who played\na perfect pass into Ramon\u2019s hand\non the left. Ramon exclaimed \u201cthis\none\u2019s for you Jenny!\u201d as he put the\nball away for his fourth and most\nimportant goal of the game.\nWith less than a minute left on the\nclock swim captain, Alex Picksley,\nmade a decisive tackle in our half\nand played the ball to safety. From\nthere, Laurie Edwards, managed to\nget the ball to captain, James (Irish)\nMccomish, who came in from the\nright side and put the ball past their\nkeeper on the near post to level\nthe scores 10-10 with less than 20\nseconds remaining.The final whistle\nblew and penalties were to follow.\nAlberto scored the first penalty\nfor Imperial and Maurice made\nan important save putting us in a\ngood position. Adamos Solomou\nstepped up next and scored, again\nfollowed by a Northumbria miss.\nNorthumbria pulled back thanks to\nan Imperial miss, but David calmly\nscored his to keep the pressure on.\nA questionable signal from the\nref meant Imperial captain, Irish,\nhorribly miscued his penalty and\ndidn\u2019t even get to take it forcing the\nteams into sudden death instead of\nsecuring the win. Alex Macaulay\nscored, as did Northumbria. Next\nup, Laurie Edwards kept calm\nunder the pressure and scored,\nputting everything on their next\npenalty taker. Imperial stood\npoolside watching as Northumbria\ntook a strong penalty towards the\nbottom right corner. But somehow,\nafter four long quarters and six good\npenalties, Maurice had the legs to\nget his hand to it sending the ball\nonto the post, and Imperial into the\nnext round.\nWell-deserved celebrations began\nimmediately and the team travelled\nhome with high hopes for the next\nstage of the competition in Sheffield\nin March.\nWith a\nnumber\nof starting\nplayers\nmissing\nthings were\nnot looking\ngood\nA reminder\nof how\nimportant the\nmatch was\nsent the tired\nteam out\nwith a new\nlease of life\nJames Mccomish\nWriter\n\n"

Although\nthere were technical reasons as to\nwhy the space could not be evenly\ndivided, they had still left only one\nfemale toilet.\nHaynes\u2019 survey proposed making\nthe four grouped toilets unisex, as\nwell as the single accessible toilet, to\nplease anyone uncomfortable with\nthe idea of mixed loos.\nThe survey results were shown to\nEstates, who agreed the situation\nwas unacceptable. Instead of\nmaking the toilets all unisex, there\nwas strong support for making the\nmen\u2019s toilets women\u2019s and making\nthe single female accessible toilet\nunisex.\nOne RSM member told FELIX:\n\u201cAs a woman in male dominated\ndepartments with usually around\nhalf the number of women\u2019s toilets\nas men\u2019s (meaning walking ten\nminutes to toilets if any are out\nof order), having our Head of\nDepartment take charge and do\nsomething about it is amaze\u201d.\nThe department of materials\nholds an Athena Swan Silver\naward, which is an accolade given\nto Higher Education or research\nbodies that can prove they are\nactively advancing female staff and\nstudents in an attempt to achieve\ngender equality in the workplace.\nThe works are to be completed\nover the 5th\nand 6th\nof March.\nFemale toilet users of RSM can\ncollectively breath a sigh in relief.\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nLabels are for cans, not for toilets.

There was\nsome miscommunication involved,\nand college were told the group\nwere arrested, which they were\nnot. However, the students were\nnot contacted by anyone at college\nduring this time (or since) regarding\ntheir safety.\nDespite the ordeal, the team went\nback to Heathrow the next day and\nflew to Berlin, before hitchhiking\nto Radzymin in Poland, which\namounted to 907 miles in 36 hours.\nThis meant they had raised \u00a3724,\nnot including the amount they had\npaid for the unused flights.\nThe group were told their removal\nwas a direct instruction from the\npilot but suspected it was because\nthey had asked a flight attendant if\nthey could make an announcement\nabout the charities to the passengers\nover the plane\u2019s intercom. The\nattendant said she would ask to the\npilot and it was soon after this that\nthey were removed.\nWhen the group returned to\nthe UK they had a meeting with\nthe union and RAG, where they\nwere told that the union would\nhelp them recover the money from\nTurkish Airlines, which would add\nto the funds they\u2019d raised for charity,\nand that perhaps there would be a\nmeeting with senior management\nat college. However, weeks passed\nand the jailbreak group did not hear\nanything from the union or college.\nEventually,through RAG,they were\ntold that the union\u2019s senior managers\nnow felt that \u201cany correspondence\nregarding this matter should come\ndirectly from the students rather\nthan from Imperial College Union\u201d.\nThe jailbreak team members\ntold FELIX they were \u201cextremely\nfrustrated\u201d with the union, so\ndecided to attempt to recoup\nthe charity money themselves.\nAlthough several weeks had now\npassed, the group repeatedly tried\nto get in contact with Turkish\nAirlines, which culminated in\nSyrian charity confusion gets RAG team pulled off flight from Heathrow to Istanbul by\nanti-terror police\nThe group spent all morning fundraising before heading to Heathrow. Photo Credit: Facebook/Two and half Asian\u2019s\nJailbreak\nThe group\nwere told\ntheir removal\nwas a direct\ninstruction\nfrom the\npilot\nthe three students turning up at\nthe company\u2019s headquarters in\nKensington Olympia last week.\nAfter initially promising them a\nfull refund, a member of staff later\nemailed the group saying they would\nonly be paid back the tax. After\nexplaining the situation once again\nto the airline, they finally agreed\nto pay back the amount which had\nbeen raised for charity.\n\u2018Hand in Hand for Syria\u2019, the\ncharity whose name seems to have\ngot them chucked off the flight,told\nFELIX that it was \u201csorry to hear\nthey encountered difficulties\u201d but\nthat \u201ctheir total raised amount was\nincredible, and we\u2019re so grateful that\nthey have dedicated to raising funds\nfor the people of Syria\u201d.\nRAG told FELIX they were\n\u201cextremely grateful for the support\nreceived during and after the\nincident from the Student Activities\nteam\u201d at the union but that it was\n\u201cunfortunate that senior managers\nin the union felt it was not\nappropriate to help out the students\nto recover the money\u201d, adding that\nthey were \u201cextremely proud of the\nteam for persevering and recovering\nthe money and delighted that this\ncan now be donated to great causes\u201d.\nThe union told FELIX that they\nhad \u201csupported these students\nimmediately after the incident and\nworked closely with College to\nensure there was no impact on their\nstudies or ability to travel in future.\nWe decided that the students would\nhave a greater chance of getting a\nrefund if they contacted the airline\ndirectly, which turned out to be\ncorrect.\u201d\nRAG jailbreak involves teams\nof students attempting to get as\nfar away from a starting point as\npossible in a 36 hour period. The\nteam can\u2019t spend any of their own\nmoney, and must use donations\nDespite the\nordeal, the\nteam went\nback to\nHeathrow\nthe next day\nor favours to travel. The teams are\nsponsored per mile they get away\nfrom Imperial, with the record\nfor the furthest being Singapore.\nAlthough this one happened back\nin November, another jailbreak\nhas been scheduled for the 19th\nof\nMarch.\nTurkey is one of the main routes\ninto Syria, especially for Westerners\nwho go there to fight. The British\npolice say they suspect up to 700\npeople from the UK have gone to\nwork or fight for jihadist causes in\nSyria and Iraq. Schedule 7 of the\nTerrorism Act 2000 allows police\nto hold people at ports, rail stations\nand airports even without needing\n\u201creasonable suspicion\u201d. They can\nthen be held for up to nine hours.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nDespite all this, they still made \u00a31100 for charity. Photo Credit: Facebook/Two and half Asian\u2019s Jailbreak\n\n"

With\nthree associate members and four \u201cI\nshouldbeinlectures\u201dmembers,there\nwas a good balance of experienced\nmembers and those who were yet to\nlearn the endless inside jokes. After\na sufficient acclimatisation period of\ncheese and chorizo, it was time to\nget into the water.\nAlthough no one was keen for the\nstandard shake out dive, we were\nall pleasantly surprised, especially\nJo \u201cMs. BSAC\u201d Beresford, as there\nwere cuttlefish at almost every\nturn. The afternoon dive was also a\npleasant surprise as the abundance\nof nudibranchs was also ideal.\nLikewise there were plenty of\nscorpionfish and bearded fireworms\nto keep us on our toes, or more\naccurately, our hands off the reef.\nThe next morning marked the first\nof many dives where we all flirted\nwith the maximum allowed depth,\nexcept for Andreas \u201cWas No One\nElse Legal\u201d Georgiou, that is. The\nBlue Hole was the chosen dive site,\nalthough it was quite dark, and thus\nthe more exotic name of the Black\nHole was used. Red Cross was the\nafternoon boat dive, and was well\nworth the five minute ride. To top\noff a great day, we went back in after\ndark for a night dive filled with\nmore cuttlefish, nudibranchs, and\nsome giant sea hares.\nWhile it wasn\u2019t a Sunday, we still\nwent to the famous Cathedral the\nnext day \u2013 it just happened to be\n30 metres under water. It wasn\u2019t\nuntil the afternoon artificial wreck\ngraveyard dive that Keshwyn\n\u201cComputer Bending\u201d Annauth\nactually monitored his depth.\nUnfortunately, the drysuit donning\nguide was strict about the \u201cdon\u2019t\ngo inside the wreck\u201d rules, which\ndid not please Olivia \u201cPenetration\nKeen\u201d Ashton. The next morning\nhad something special in store,\ntwo seahorses, leading Alex \u201cBaby\nInstructor\u201d Leonard to call the\nunnamed dive the \u201cSeahorse\nSafari\u201d. The afternoon held in store\na welcomed shallower dive,allowing\neveryone to breathe a bit more than\nusual. The night was topped off\nwith a final night dive, with Karim\n\u201cFashionably Late\u201d Nahas leading\nfrom the front. The final dive\ninvolved a serious surface swim, but\nGrouper Run did not disappoint,\nand there were plenty of the giant\nfish to spot.\nThe trip ended as most ICUC\ntrips do, and that was with a\nfew decompression beers, wines,\nsangrias, shots, and ice cream.\nCarrying on the tradition attributed\nto the legendary previous chair\nTheo, the last night ended back in\nthe water sans clothes. Luckily Josh\n\u201cHides Your Clothes\u201d Mo was on\nhand to help everyone dry off first.\nICUC on some Finding Nemo hype.

Photo Credit: The\nGuardian\nB\noycotts have long been a\nway for local government\nto use direct action to\ncondemn government\napproved policies, such as apartheid.\nHowever, the government has\nannounced new plans to bring down\nheavy punishments on government-funded bodies such as NHS Trusts,\ncity councils and universities if they\nchoose to operate so-called \u201ctownhall boycotts\u201d.\nThe government has called such\nprotests \u201cdivisive\u201d and say they have\nthe potential to be anti-semetic.\nIt\u2019s not just Israeli products that it\nwill be illegal to avoid for \u201cunethical\u201d\nreasons. Companies involved in the\narms, tobacco or fossil fuels trades\nwill also be safe from democratically\nvoted for \u2018discrimination\u2019.\nFirms who up until recently\nwere running some operations\nin the West Bank, such as Veolia\nand Sodastream, have since left\nthe area due to mounting pressure\nfrom the public. Scarlett Johansson\nnotoriously severed her ties with\nOxfam rather than the sponsorship\ndeal she had with SodaStream when\nthe charity expressed disapproval of\ncompanies with factories in the area.\nLast year, Sussex\u2019s student union\nvoted to join the boycott,divestment\nand sanctions movement by\nchoosing not to sell Israeli products\nin their union-run shops. SOAS\nstudents voted last year in favour\nof a boycott of Israeli academic\ninstitutions. The union\u2019s YES\ncampaign emphasised after their\nwin that the move was to target\n\u201cIsraeli institutions complicit in\nthe oppression of Palestinians, not\nindividuals\u201d.\nImperial\u2019s own union has not\nvoted to boycott any Israeli products\nor institutions.\nThe rules could also affect\npublic bodies boycotting other\ncauses or businesses, such as\narms manufacturers or fossil fuel\ncompanies, many of which have\nbeen boycotted by other universities.\nThe move has been called an\n\u201cattack on local democracy\u201d by\nrepresentatives of Labour leader,\nJeremy Corbyn. If this rule had\nexisted back in the 60s and 70s,\nthe anti-apartheid in South Africa\nmovement of boycotts would have\nbeen illegal.\nThe official announcement of the\npolicy is due to be made by Cabinet\nMinister, Matt Hancock, when he\nvisits Israel in a few days time.\nFELIX previously reported that\nseveral Imperial academics had\nsigned an open letter promising to\nboycott Israeli institutions. Boycotts\nlike this would be perfectly legal\nunder new rules.\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nImperial RAG mag story published in Evening\nStandard and MailOnline\nCompanies\ninvolved in\nthe arms,\ntobacco or\nfossil fuels\ntrades will\nalso be safe\ncontinued from front page\nThe piece went online on Tuesday\nmorning, and remained on the front\npage of the Evening Standard\u2019s\nwebsite for several hours.\nAs the Evening Standard story\nbroke, the president\u2019s personal\nTwitter account became private.\nLater that day a similar story\nappeared on the Daily Mail\u2019s\nwebsite.This longer article included\nmultiple references to Lucinda\u2019s\ncomment piece in last week\u2019s\nFELIX, in which she claimed that\nshe had been the victim of \u201ctrollish\nstereotyping and personal attacks\u201d\nand that the union\u2019s actions were\n\u201cin no way preventing RAG from\nraising money\u201d.\nLower down in the piece, which\nswings in no particular direction\nin support, it\u2019s mentioned that IC\nFemSoc said they hadn\u2019t thought\nthe piece was sexist.\nThe article also links to an Imgur\nupload of the RAG article itself,\nwhich FELIX has been unable to\nprint.\nIn the article\u2019s comment section,\nThe story didn\u2019t quite make the sidebar of shame.

A\nresearch team led by Nils Schuergers\nexposed a plate of Synechocystis\nto a directed light source under a\nmicroscope, to then observe the\nbacterial response At the bacteria\u2019s\nside opposite to the incident light\nand direction of movement, a bright\nspot was realised. They discovered\nthat this was indicative of the\nbacteria acting like a little eye. The\nlight spot was the result of light\nfocused from the beam, hitting the\nbacteria, the bacterias surface then\nbehaving as a lens,and its cytoplasm\nas the retina, re-focussing the light\nbeam.\nThis phototaxis process by\nSynechocystis is a negative response\nto bright light exposure on their\nsurface. Scientists investigated\nthis further by shining a laser onto\nthe centre of a plate contiaing\nSynechocystis, and then using a\nlight to direct the cells towards this\ncentre. They found that cells would\nMorgaine Stiles\nWriter\nA fresh look through bacteria\nBacteria or eyes? Synechocystis elicit a primitive version of \u2018sight\u2019.

It\nis a fingerprint of our individuality,\ncapturing our primitive past and\neven the behaviour of our ancestors;\nand it seems our ancestors hooked\nup with our evolutionary \u2018cousins\u2019\na lot earlier than we previously\nthought. Specifically 110,000 years\nearlier.\nIt is not a novelty that we find\nNeanderthal DNA in human DNA,\nhowever, an international group\nof researchers recently found the\npresence of a reverse situation. That\nis, human DNA incorporated into\nthe genetic code of a Neanderthal.\nA 50,000-year-old Neanderthal toe\nbone contained a human signature\nembedded within its collagen case.\nThe findings have posed the need\nto rethink human migration in the\nlight of the now apparent genetic\nevidence, pointing strongly to an\nearlier migration out of Africa.\nKuhlwilm et al. 2016 @ Nature\nmove towards the laser, until they\nhit the beam, where they would\nthen retract.\nFurther research showed that,\nwhen two sources of light were\nintroduced, the bacteria would\npresent two spots on their surface,\nand move towards the light sources\nat an intermediate angle between\nthe two.\nBeing cyanobacteria, and thus\nusing photosynthesis to make\nglucose for energy, it is important\nthat Synechocystis and similar\nbacteria have a system to navigate\ntowards optimal light conditions.\nThat is, the bacteria need enough\nlight to make sufficient glucose,\nbut should not be exposed to too\nmuch light, which would damage\nthe bacteria cell. Here scientists\nexplored the mechanism to which\nthis optimum is achieved.\nAlthough this is a beautifully\nelegant method for spherical\nbacteria to respond to light, it\nremains to be seen how this will\ntranslate to rod shaped bacteria,\nassuming, they even use a similar\nmethod\u2026 Watch this space.\nC\nane sugar, honey, raw\nturbinado, coconut\nsugar, agave syrup. Many\nnutrition experts sitting\non their high horses all wax lyrical\nover these glistening labels, eager to\nproclaim the nutritional properties\nof each.

All these sugars\nare the same, in the sense that they\nall get processed the same way.\nToo much sugar in any form is\ndangerous.\nProcessed starches and breakfast\ncereals might as well unzip\nthemselves from their beige coats\nbecause they are digested in an\ninstant, in much the same way as\nour bodies process that brownie or\nbowl of salted caramel Haagen Dazs\n(which I must admit will always be\na firm favourite of mine). Eating a\nbowl of sugar and eating a bowl of\ncereal may taste different, but below\nthe neck, they\u2019re metabolically\nidentical.\nSo what about sugar in fruit?\nAh, another question that almost\nAlexandra Lim\nWriter\nAre there really different sugars?\nOr why your agave syrup isn\u2019t really any better\nScience\n& the City\nS\nhe walks among us and with\nus.

But it\u2019s more than just a\npragmatic method of understanding\nthe universe and creating new ways\nto navigate and interact with it;\nit\u2019s a creative force in our human\nsociety with powerful feedback\nmechanisms that determine many\naspects of our lives. So no matter\nhow interesting (or dreary) you may\nfind it, it\u2019s worth exploring how we\ninteract with science and the many\nimpacts it has on our lives \u2013 from\nthe kid learning the hard way that\ngravity is a very real force when they\ndo that first belly flop at the pool, to\nthe disenchanted adult zoning out\non the couch, to some droning late\nnight news about climate change.\nIn Science & the City we\u2019ll\nexplore the many interconnected\nways that we interact with the\nscientific way of thinking, and\nits real-world application. From\nsocietal interactions, challenges\nwithin scientific communities,\nconnecting science with other\nsectors and spheres of life,to cultural\nand historical understandings and\nbeyond, we\u2019ll explore together this\nvery modern way of thinking about\nour world. Questions like why is\nso much of researcher\u2019s time now\nallocated to grant writing instead\nof research? How do we address\nsexism in laboratories and research\nfacilities? Why are field naturalists\ndying out? How do we make\nour research exciting to different\naudiences \u2013 or do we even need to?\nConsidering Imperial College\u2019s\nstrengthsinsciencesandthefactthat\nwe have the greatest concentration\nof high-impact research of any\nUK university, many of us will go\non work directly in science, often\nin influential positions. So let\u2019s\nconsider what space it is that science\noccupies in the world as we move\nthrough it, with it, and because of it.\nAnd if you have any thoughts\naround the human side of science,\nget in touch, and we can go for a\ncoffee (or tea, or water, or whatever)\nand explore your views of Science &\nthe City.\nNAOMI STEWART\ndemands a series of catfights in the\nvegan community. Yes, fruit has\nlots of sugar, especially mangoes,\ndurians and grapes. Even the ratio\nof fructose to glucose in fruit and\ntable sugar is practically the same.\nKeeping in mind many scientific\nstudies have proven that, although\nfructose increases blood insulin\nand glucose levels in the fasting\nstate, making it seem that much\nbetter than glucose alone, it actually\nincreases average triglyceride levels\nmore than glucose. However, it\u2019s\nthe fibre and vitamins in fruit that\ncompensate for this, and add to the\nwholesomeness of eating fruit. The\nproblem arises when you\u2019ve got a\nbottle of fruit juice for fuel, because\nthis has no fibre whatsoever. You\nSugar resembles crystal meth a bit too much. Coincidence?

Sadly,\nand ironically, the stuff wreaks\nhavoc on our normal metabolic\nroutes and hormones, most notably\ninsulin\u2019s neurobiological actions.\nThe infamous sweetners aspartame\nand Splenda still produce drastic\nspikes in insulin because the brain\nis tricked into wanting sugar, sugar\nand more sugar.\nI know I\u2019m making it sound like\nthere\u2019s just no win-win situation.

The first five\nminutes were relentless from the\nboys, giving the medics no room\nto breathe. Five minutes gone, five\npoints scored, courtesy of Mike\nThe whole gang. Photo Credit: ICURFC\nThe score was 34-15 to IC Rugby 1s in their match against the King\u2019s Medics\nWright who crashed in from short\nrange.\nA bit of sloppy play allowed Kings\nto go over in the corner to level the\nscore. Game on. A strong restart\nfrom IC allowed Tom Hedley to\ntrundle over from the back of the\nmaul. Another brilliant piece of\nplay allowed the towering Josh\nO\u2019Donnell to go over in the corner.\nI believe there was something about\na scrum try for King\u2019s, but I won\u2019t\ngo into that for the sake of the\nforwards.\nSoon IC were able to force the\nhand of the ref. The King\u2019s player\nsaw a yellow. Poor guy, he probably\njust fancied a respite from the\nunrelenting pummelling. Soon\nanother IC maul was over the line.\nTom Hedley, once again. It makes\nyou think that maybe he plans to\nstay at the back of the mauls, doesn\u2019t\nit?\nAnd then it happened, a moment\nof pure brilliance. The ball was\npassed out to the faster, more\nhandsome Bryan Habana, Alex\nTamato (Not DNS). Given some\nspace, the dashing young speedster\nand author of this article, was able\nto take on the full-back and with\nhis silky smooth feet and tiny lady\nhips send him the wrong way to\nwaltz on past him. Amato could see\nthe line gleaming in front of him\nand the chance to finally earn his\nfather\u2019s love, but alas the opposition\nwinger just managed to bring him\ndown. A moment of silence broke\nand hearts were in mouths, which\nwas all rather melodramatic as his\nmomentum carried him over to\nscore half a second later.\nNo. 9, James Field, was taken off\nthe field so we could field another\nscrum half/stroppy toddler, Matt\nBlackett. Despite the best efforts of\nBlackett and the opposition on the\nside of the field, he was unable to\nsufficiently piss off the referee and,\nmuch to Field\u2019s disappointment,\nremained on the field.\nThe bonus point confirmed, IC\nwent for the jugular, knowing that\npoints difference would likely\ndecide the league.

Outclassed.\nA less than satisfying end to a\nmediocre performance from IC,who\nknow they\u2019ve got more to give.Final\nscore was 34-15.

The game opened\nwith a few changes to the regularly\nfielded side \u2013 most notably in the\nbacks with Ed Durkin stepping in\nat ten. A guest appearance at prop\nfrom Eifion Foster got the horns\nblowing when he put Hobson over\nthe line for the first score of the\ngame and the second score of his\nlife.

And yes, since\nScottish money is legal tender in\nEngland, that means a new face will\nbe on the funny looking notes that\nmomentarily confuse you every now\nand then at the ATM. Personally I\nthink it\u2019s a solid choice considering\nthatbyallaccounts,MarySomerville\nwas a textbook scientific badass.\nDespite showing great intelligence\nfrom a young age, Somerville\u2019s\neducation was largely informal and\npartially self-taught due to the social\nconventions restricting her from\nhigher education. The restrictions\nplaced upon her only worsened after\nthe death of her 10 year-old sister,\nwhich her parents blamed on Mary\u2019s\ndetermination to be educated.\nRegardless of these hurdles\nSomerville became a respected name\nin the scientific community as an\nadult, her translations and original\nworks about astronomy becoming\nwidely popular. She became the\nfirst female member of the Royal\nAstronomical Society and her work\nwas instrumental in predicting the\npresence of the 9th\nplanet, Neptune\nin our solar system. On top of\nall that, Somerville continued to\nfulfil the expectations of a well-connected socialite, supported\nwomen\u2019s suffrage and was one of\nthe most influential science writers\nof her time.\nMary Somerville may be the\nfirst female scientist to appear on\na Scottish banknote, but when it\ncomes to representation, scientists\ndo quite well for themselves. To\nname just a few\u2026\nCharles Darwin\nOk we\u2019re starting off with the easy\none; Darwin is the only scientist\nto be featured on a note currently\nin circulation, as well as being the\nmost famous biologist of all time.\nHowever, none of this could have\nbeen predicted when he initially\nboarded The Beagle. Darwin had\nnot completed his studies and\ntherefore was taken on as a self-funded secondary naturalist for\nthe journey, with the ship\u2019s doctor\nholding the role official. Even his\nfather considered the trip a waste\nof time. Darwin and his majestic\nbeard are gracing our tenners aat\nthe moment and have been there\nsince the turn of the millennium.\nHowever,the prolific regency author\nJane Austen is scheduled to replace\nMary Somerville, a scientific badass in astronomy and mathematics, proposed to be the new face of the Scottish \u00a310.

A lesser known\nrole is the fact that Newton served\nas warden of the Royal Mint, or\n\u201cMaster of the Mint\u201d for 30 years.\nIt\u2019s quite fitting then that Newton\u2019s\nface was stamped on all one pound\nnotes from 1978 until 1988, when\nthe switch to coins sadly took\nhim and his fancy telescope out of\ncirculation forever.\nFlorence Nightingale\nI\u2019m counting the lady of the lamp\non this list because her revolution\nof nursing was down to applying\nsimple scientific principle to medical\npractices. In addition , Nightingale\nwas a talented statistician and\nthe first female inducted into the\nRoyal Statistical Society. One of\nthe hallmarks of Nightingale\u2019s\ncareer were sanitary reforms, after\ndemonstrating with stats that a lack\nof sanitation was directly linked to\nmortality rates in rural India. Based\non her findings, she continued to\nlobby for social reforms to improve\nhygiene in Britain and abroad.\nNightingale later set up a Nursing\nSchool and wrote multiple books on\nher methods of care, some of which\nare still used today. Much like Mary\nSomerville, Nightingale also found\ntime to be a pioneering feminist,\nwriting a series of essays on female\nindependence. Literature critic\nElaine Showalter dubbed the most\nfamous of these essays \u201cCassandra\u201d,\na \u201cmajor text of English feminism\u201d.\nFlorence Nightingale was on the\n\u00a310 note for 19 years before being\nreplaced by Charles Dickens.\nAs for future nominees for the\nhonour of being on the other side of\nthe Queen\u2019s face, my personal picks\nare\u2026\nAda Lovelace\nWhy? Easy. Lovelace was a\ncharismatic mathematician and\nwidely considered to be the first\ncomputer programmer, writing\nthe first algorithm designed to\nbe performed by a machine.\nAdditionally, Lovelace was close\nfriends with and was tutored by\nSomerville. These women both\nbeing on currency money together\nwould be a triumph for the scientific\nsisterhood.\nJ.J. Thompson\nWhy? Aside from having a\ncool name and excellent facial\nhair, Thompson was a as a genius\nphysicist who won a Nobel prize for\ndiscovering the electron in 1906.He\nwas also a gifted teacher, inspiring\nmany famous pupils including\nErnest Rutherford and Niels Bohr\nwho would go on to make major\ndiscoveries in physics as well.\nThis week\u2019s science picture\nNatasha Khaleeq\nWriter\nA mumerical stimulation of the black hole colision Colours signify the degree of petrubation of the spacetime fabric (the gravitational waves).

The measurements suggest\nthe black hole collision released a\nwave og gravitational energy equal\nto three times the mass of the sun.\nProf Danzmann (a leading\nEuropean scientist at LIGO)\npraised the finding as one of the\nmost important discoveries since\nthe Higgs boson and on par with\nthe discovery of the double helix.\nDetecting the waves opens up\nthe Universe to completely new\ninvestigations leading to a new era\nof astronomy.\nC\nockroaches are despised\nby everyone. With the\nwhole human race out\nto squash them into\noblivion, you\u2019d think they\u2019d have\ndied out by now. But instead, they\nthrive, popping up in the most\nrandom places, and miraculously\nsurviving the most vigorous\nsquashing. Scientists have therefore\nspent months investigating why\nit is so freaking hard to squish a\ncockroach.\nScientists from the University\nof California have collected\nhundreds of high-resolution, slow-motion videos of them squishing\ncockroaches. This technology\nshowed that a cockroach can\nprogress at top velocity, a whopping\n600mm per second, through a 6mm\nhigh crack, and can fit comfortably\nin a crack as small as 3.2mm high.To\nconfirm that cockroaches are super\ncompressible,the scientists flattened\nthem with a piston applying up to\n900 times their own body weight.\nThe nobble cockroach Periplaneta americana, practicaly (and to our dismay)\nunsquishable.

This shows\nto everyone that the cockroach is,\nscientifically, the creepiest animal\non Earth (or is that just me?).\nBut there is more to this research.\nIt subscribes to a line of scientific\ninvestigation called terradynamics,\nwhere scientists study how animals\nmoveinthehopeofdesigningrobots\ncapable of negotiating complex\nterrain, such as muddy, sandy, or\nrough surfaces. By analysing the\nmovements of cockroaches, the\nscientists have uncovered a new\nmode of locomotion on which\nthey modelled a palm-sized, soft-bodied legged robot. This robot\ncan manipulate very rough and\nconstricting environments in a\nway that no other robot could. The\nauthors of the paper claim that\nthis is the first step towards an\neffective \u2018search-and-rescue\u2019 robot,\nwhich could help us rapidly locate\nsurvivors in disaster situations.\nSo next time you question the\nlogic behind a piece of research,\nnext time you look at a Nature\narticle twice,scrunching up your\nface,next time you roll your eyes\nto the projects that manage to\nsecure funding despite being\nbased on some seemingly\nridiculous premise, think about\nwhat we\u2019ve learned from the\ncreepy yet humble cockroach\nand recognise that perhaps sh!t\nscience is in fact....The Sh!t.\nBe free litle buddy.
