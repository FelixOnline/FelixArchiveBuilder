    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILES THE EDITORS ALARM\n\" Will70 a writ* ali ttl* sooner,\"said the Editor to his aw n, \"Press day is now upon us and wa h avn' t raised a pen.\nThink how angrily our readers and subscribers would protest\nIf they hadn't got their Friday rag with wh i oh they always jest.\"\nWill yon, won't you, will you, won't you, will you start to writ*?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will yon start to writ*?\n\"Ton really have no notion how demented Is hall be,\nIf they writ* and tell me even one* they hate the gat s of me.\"\nBut all the board with one accord immediately said\n\"Ton know it really is through us that Felix can be read.\"\nCan't you, won't you, cant' you, won't you, can't you start to write?\nCan't you, won't you, can't you, won't you, can't you start to write?\n\" It matters little at what time we all see fit to come\nFor no matter when we start, the job is always done.\"\nAt last the suffering Editor decides HE will begin,\nAnd his merry band of helpers decide they will join in. Will you, won't you, will you, wont you, won't you start to type*\nWill you, won't you, will yon, won't you, won't you start to type/\nTHE POWERS THAT BE While none of the characters in this photograph is actually carrying the Times, they are\nall Top People. Felix offers no prize|to the\nfirst to identify them. Their separate likenesses have each adorned these papers before,\nand they now do so together because of the it\neditor's metaphysical belief in emergent evo-lu tion: the doctrine, that the assembly may add\nup to more than the sum of the parts.\nThe parts themselves are intrinsically\nremarkable. The seated,sages,Tony Goodings,\nJohn Hart and Mike Rutter, who guide the\ndestinies of R.C.S., Guilds and Mines, are each\nformidable figures. The last two,particularly,\nbring a wider vision to Onion discussions from\ntheir exotic backgrounds in Rhodesia and Lancashire. All have admired the versatile mastery of\nthis trio at fresher s dinners, Union meetings,\ncarnivals,and in the dignified old world atmosphere\nof the various formal dances. Then, loom i agf from the insets, there are the less-publicised\nfigures of retired oarsman Kim Ash and barnstorming Les Allen. These gentlemen, the Chairmen of A.C.C. and S. C.C., spin a mysterious financial web in the background, and distribute vast\nsums of Union money to the clubs.\nStanding left, and much improving the picture,\nMiss Wendy Pipe, the President of I. C.W. A. Seldom can this depressed class have had a livelier leader, or one so accurate with a saucepan-ful of water.\nStanding right, Union Secretary Andy Levine,\none-t lae Guilds president, twice Student Orator,\nand now (supreme honour!)

The Union President,\na man of foresight (tipped Crepello for the\nDerby at Christmas), has served in many offices,\nbut never to such valuable (and sometimes de-va stating) effect as now.\nAbove the individual eccentricities of this\nexceptional octet rises their collective contribution to student democracy and independence\nduring this year of re-establishment and re-consolidation. Tha Union depends on the willing\nand capable, characters who man its( frequently\ntedious) coa mitte es and give up much of their\nspare time to man them.If the electorate picks\nas good a collection of forthright spokesmen for\nnext session it will have done well.\nCHARTER JUBILEE For the o on veni eno* of its readers, Felix reproduces the acre important details of the\nofficial programme for* a j28 th \u00bb\n3.02 Mr. Allen will take th* Gentleman-is*-Waiting's hat, and will place it la the\nPowder Eoos.\n3.1*\n3.24\n3.28\nMr. Batter, Mr. Goodings, Mr. Bart m& Mr. Levine, who will b*la th* Freoessipa and on the Platform, should be !\u2022\nposition near th* Powder Room at 2.40,\nand whan the Chancellor has *nt*r*dt a* Reading Roost they will taka position far the Proosssiea (with Mr. Lavias, the\nStudent Bedell in front) near the ents a a as to the vestibule just in a ld* the 3ea la a> Coarjoa Room,\nBofara taw Cbaacallssr rises, Hr< Saaford.\nwho will o*la ta*wi mga( aorta.) will B0T* the nearest a i or sph o a a aad glass It han^y to the Chanoallar.\nWhen tha applause far the SkwasaUar's speech diss down, Mr. Ssafars will pla a* tha a i or oph oas la front af tha 1\nWM \u00bb tha app la as e for Jfcv\ndied down, tb* feats* will thanks of fiat Callage tat te3.33 Bigkt tall a eat ara of the Guard of Honour, instructed by Mr. Hewoy, will be in oh arg* of th* eight large umbrellas, aad\nwill shelter Her Majesty and other members\nof ta*p roo ea a i enal party across ta* Garden and Priaa* (..es or* Road.\n(See Water Rag Report)\n4.06-4.10 The Chanoellear, together with those\nla attend a no*, will go by taw west ant rano e of the Large Structures Laboratory\nto the court yard where the 3 College\nas soot s will as drawn up t* tha sooth.\n4.10-4.34 If the weather is wat th* Large BB~ te all s s will be a sed forth* return j om Whsa Mr. Annas sees the Cibmaoellar i as peat i ag. tha Hasoots he will go tet a a Bait Arotaray aad la fera Mr. Barley mt\u00bb\nwill as ta the Walaa Building sad i at waa Mr. Washy who will ha at the fci a a Sees?.\nMr. Bewfcy will wars tas sts i afa am a a ah ft as r sad th* stewards *a tha firs* Osjaw\nfill wax* those la the aiming Sail.4*1? f*a wall ho se\u00abwe&\n5.99 Sr. All a a will tafe j, \u00bb\u00ab\u00ab0\u00ab'*J \u00ab*te W n it tag's hat t tim. j mU UMm fit1' ENGINEERS' BALL\nTh* Engineer's Ball last Friday night\nturned out tc be its usual unrivalled sue*\nces s. It started at a few minutes pa at eight whan a somewhat inebriated top table\nstumbled in, and after finding their places,\nth* dinner was served. This was an excellent\nmeal - with shrimps, chicken, etc. The only\nfault with th* dinner was that the main dish\nprovided was beer. One or two of the ladies\nsee aed to like this, but on the whole they\npreferred to renal n dry.\nWhen the dinner finally finished the band\nhad already been playing for over an hour\nto the few non-diners. The arrangement of\nth* Concert Hall was well done, with arm-ob niv s and tables suitably arranged. The\ndancing lasted until3 sua., the floor being\nnever empty and never crowded. Our correspondent considers that this was on* of th* best social events for a long tine.\nFAIR DEAL FOR MILLER\nKEITH MILLER, continued.\nLast year Miller was rightly highly\npraised for his work in helping to found the\nExploration Board which was one of the college\nshowpieces. This year when trouble is in the\nair, the college even though assured of the\ngood publicity from the Expedition tried to\nhush up the whole business. Apparently loyalty\nto its students does not extend to the risk of\na little publicity. Hot that such publicity\nwould have any adverse effects on the college\nfor is it not reasonable to suppose that everyone would sym pathis e with a college seeking to\nhave such a ban removed or at least to be informed of the reasons why the ban was placed/' As\nMr. Miller has been heard to say in the Bar,\n\"lou know who your real friends are when you\nreally need them\".\nIt is reassuring to know that the democratic\nmachine does operate and that secret governmental\ndecisions can be reversed and someone had to\nclimb down. Readers of Felix will rejoice in\nthis and wish Keith and his merry band the very\nbest of luck in them thar hills. \u00ab stave sia s,ao xj a jSa oia ew&9? of ds nsS^ OOT, ea, *tT*aW\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nSUCCESS AND FAILURE In the U.L. Trials, three members of I.C. distinguished themselves; Brian Curtis in the furlong,\nTerry Hyslop in the 120 and 440 yd s. hurdles events\nand Dave Smith in the Hop Step and Jump. The latter\nproduced a jump of 47'2\", which unfortunately was\nnot allowed.\nThese three members of the Club, plus Les Locke,!\nrepresented the University in the match against\nParis on Sunday 5th. May. Here Smith won with a triple-jump of 46'6\". This, and Hyslop's performance of 55-6 sees, in the 440yd s. hurdles, make\nthem rank in the best twelve performers in Great\nBritain in the last year. The previous evening in Paris may have had some stimulating! mental effect.\nI.C. have had one match, versus Sheffield and\nBirmingham Universities (at Sheffield), in which\nwe were last. However, we introduced new songs\ninto their bar and enjoyed their Hop. Much, sport\n(but no can-can dancing) was also exhibited oh\nthe early morning train home.\nWe had a weak team at the above meeting and\nthis is partly due to the indifference shown by\nmembers in their support of the College club. In\nsome events we cannot even raise the required a number of competitors and the points for placings\nare thus being thrown away. More enthusiasm is required and all members are asked to keep a close\nwatch on the notice-board. New recruits of any\nstandard are still most welcome.\nathletics\nSPORTS DAY.\nComing Athletice Fixture* \u2022\nWW 22^' 2!* C0l le8e W Wimbledon\nwee?' \u00bb\"y f118101* CARDIFF NN I'S( A) Bristol!\nWed. 29th. Bay Loughborough (A)!100 YARDS\nI.C. W.S.C. SHOCK THE JUDGES\nOnce again ICWSC fielded a team of gallant,\nbrave, dauntless, un fault e ring sportswomen to\nparticipate in the U.L. Championships. They\nfought their way to the finals, their spirit sun damped by torrential rain, there to give a magnificent display of their ability. As one\nJudge was heard to remark to another during\nthe W>, \"Oh, here oc me the other two. Do you\nthink they are going to finish?\"And they did( eventually) to win 5 points for I.C. One competitor in the high Jump o alm ly announced her intention to start jumping at\n4'6\", the I.C. entrant however flew with grace\nand comparative ease over 3'6\" to finish equal\n5th. The hurdler excelled herself by completing\nthe course leaving all the hurdles standing and\nundamaged, to oom ea valiant 5th. The long Jump finalist, apart from being\nsurrounded by cameramen clam our ing to take her\nphotograph, also learnt how to do the long\nJump, never before having attempted such a magnificent feat.\nThe results? fell ICWSC came 6th for the\nU.L. Challenge Cup and a close third for the\nSherwood-Factor Cup.\nSpecial mention should he mads of Janet Petersen who came 2nd. in the 880.yd s. and has been\nasked to represent London University in ths\nBritish Universities competition.\nRUG GER CLUB At the A.

Seed\nThe business of organising a tour in S.v. France next Christmas was put in the hands of\nnext years o ap able secretary before the mooting\nretired to the bar. Here Les Wilson, our Cornw all tour coach driver, led a convivial evening\nand later the assembled company departed in his dilapidated coach to a local hostelry)\nDespite the fact that this major event was\nheld much earlier in the season this year, College\nRecords were set up in the Shot Putt (J. W.S. Newman - 40' Si\"\"), Javelin (H. T.L. Evans171'8'') and the mile medley relay (Guilds -3 mins 42.4 sees.). \"Best Sports Performances\"\nwere set up in two other events. One was in the\n120 yards hurdles by Terry Hyslop in15.5 sees,\nand the other was in the 1-mile by John Evans\n(4 mins 13.1 sees) who made other runners resemble cripples.\nRumoured lack of training of the'R.C.S. tug-of-war team was disproved when they beat\nGpilds In the final after a lengthy l st pull\nwhich brought spectators to their feet in excitement.\nBrian Curtis completed the double in the\nsprints (10.2 and 23.3sees) and Les Locke won\nbo^h the 440 yards (51.4 sees.) and the -jt-mile\n(2 mins. 1.8 sees.).\nWith George Schenkel, the holder, missing\na bruised knee, the pole vault title was taken\nby A.W. Smith who cleared 9'6\" in excellent\nstyle.\nBoth jumps were of a good standard, John*\nHobson producing 20' 10$-\" in the long jump and\nT. Hyslop clearing 5*Tin the high jump.\nOther notable performances were by triple jumper Dave Smith who was 2nd. in the javelin\nwith 160.'7'.'i only 3' short of the old record,\nand Pete Rayment who led most of the way on the\n\u2022Jr-mlle (2nd. in2 mins 2.8 sees.).\nCongratulations to Guilds who won the\nChallenge Shield easily, with R.C.S. second.\nThe few spectators who did turn up to\nsupport their colleges were treated to an\nenjoyable afternoon's sport in glorious\nweather.\nCRICKET\nThe 1st. XI has not made a good start to the\nseason, due mainly to the instability of its bat-ting. However this early season rustiness is beginning to disappear,as seen last Saturday,when\nI.C.h it1548 declared against O. Sinjuns, and\nlost a very close match by two wickets in the\nlast over of the day. Murden (53) and Shepherd\n(40) were the main contributors to the total.\nAgainst L.S.E., the l st. XI lost by one run,\nthe last eight wickets falling for 12 runs.. In\nthe match against Reading University they scored\n207-6, whilst I.C. only managed to make 109-9.\nR.A.E. Farnborough were no match for the I.C. bowlers and were all out for 34, I.C. winning by\neight wickets. The most successful bowler to date\nhas been N. Bbattl, while J. Carter has bowled well\nbut has suffered the fate of all slow bowlers -dropped catches.\nThe 2nd. XI has played three matches so far,\nall of which have bean drawn.\nU.L. CHAMPIONSHIPS In the finals of the U.L. Championships on Sat.\n11th May at Hotspur Park, I.C. narrowly lost the\nRoseberry Challenge ;Cup to U.C. by 81 pts. to 70.\nthe result would have probably been much closer\nbut for a motor-cycle accident to Hyslop on his way to the track to appear in four finals, and\nthe absence of Locke, playing football for Scotland. Ve o an look forward to next year with considerable confidence, as several of ear fresher s performed extremely well, especially In the\nevents in which we have not had finalists for several years, Curtis 2nd. in the 220 and third in the 100yd s. and Newman 4thin the shot. Evans,\nwinning ths mile in40412.6 sees and Smith 1st in the hop-step-s nd Jump, were our only in divi dual winners, and deserve congratulations on\ntheir performances.

    "content": ">\nFELIX DRINKING FOUNTAINS/ The many drinking fountains and o attie troughs In tha Borough of Kensington are a legacy wh i oh dates bao k nearly a century.\nWithin ons mile of the Albert Hall there\nexist more than twenty drinking fountains,\nthree of wh i oh are integrated with cattle\ntroughs. Surprisingly the majority still function and most of the fountains are\nfitted with some sort of battered alloy drinking mug hung on a length of chain.\nTh* provision of this fit ment enables one\nto drink in a civilised manner - instead of\nsuffering the indignity of presenting one's face to a wavering jet of cold water.\nThirsty dumb animals are not neglected\neither. The production model drinking fount a in supplied by the Metropolitan Drinking\nFountains and Cattle Troughs Association,\n(M. D.F. and C.T. Assn.) has a small foot-bath in the base of the fountain from wh i oh lower creatures may drink.\nMany of the local drinking fountains are\nInteresting as examples of monumental work\nand as sources of local history. The old fountain opposite the taxi rank on Kensington Gore shows the charitable nature of the\nlocal residents. 'Presented to the Parish\nby an inhabitant of Kensington in1859' it is now believed to provide tea-water for the nearby taxi-drivers' canteen. The cattle trough beside the canteen bears the inscription, 'be kind and merciful to all animals;\nin memory of Esther Benjamin, f8241879.' Through the M. D.F. and C.T. Assn. the Benjamin family have been associated with other\ncattle troughs; on* in Bayswatar Road is attributed to David Benjamin, 1815 to1895 Just off the Broad Walk In Kensington\nGardens a bronze fountain was 'erected in1951to mark the site of an ancient spring\nwh i oh in1856 was named St. Gorvor'a Well\nICWIZ\n(After answering these questions honestly, tarn\nto page 7 to see what type you are)\n1) Do you get up\na) in tia e for breakfast\nb) is time for lectures\no) in time for lunch\n2) Do you wash\na) before meals\nb) one* a day\no) not at all J) Do you a at a) at tha Savoy\nb) at Jane Brawn'so) at Mooney'sd) not at all4) In lectures do you wear\na) a skirt b) trousers\no) both\nd) neither\nafter th* patron saint of Hanover by Sir Benjamin Hall, the first Commissioner of\nWorks, 1855 to1858, and created Lord Lienover in1859.* Th* fountain given by His Highness the\nMaharajah of Vijianagran Is certainly th* largest fountain in this dist riot and is th* only one with royal associations; for this, 'Cattle Trough' has been omitted\nfrom the M.

It was erected in1867 but\nunfortunately th* sandstone steeple with\nits buttresses, griffins and gargoyles\nhas been severely eroded and it is now\nsurrounded by a paling.fane s for protect-ion.\nTha fountain marking the 80th. anniversary of the Association is crow aed with\nao harming bronze statuette of two bear\ncubs fighting; it is the work of Keeble\nSmith.\nOther fountains are too numerous to describe in detail. On one in Hyde Park,\na nymph seated on a water lily leaf holds\na spouting dolphin under each arm. By St.\nGeorge's Hospital a flower seller uses\none as avas s, and tha fountain in Exhibi tion Road ( in memory of L.

The Association is still erecting\nfountains, the latest being outside Caltsx\nHons* in Brampton Read.

    "content": "it ux ROMANCE AT COLLEGE Beginning a new.eeri al of love and\npaa a ion sat in tha heart of the Onion.\nLeonora stood on the edge of the\ndance floor a pathetic figure - mousey\nhair Just touching her drooping shoulders,\nher squinting eyes misty with the un shed tears, her mouth a little too large for true beauty. Those swimming eyes fol lowed the dashing Rugger captain as he\na wept by laughing gaily o yer the shoulder\nof a beautiful woman, and it was like* knife turning in her tortured breast .\nThere was a oh ok lng sensation in her\nthroat, and rushing from the hall she\nthrew herself down in the Ladies Cloakroom, the bitter tears flowing uno he oke d down her ashen oh eek s. Soon the sobs\nw racked her body less often, and the con-v ul sive shuddering s ceased. She sat up\nand looked at her reflection in the mirror.\nHow had she come to this sorry state?\nHer thoughts went bao k to the day she\nhad first met Snotty as hi a friends affectionately called him - the tall handsome\nSnotty who only ten minutes previously had\nout her dead out there on the dance floor. It had mot been a romantic meeting -the refectory queue and Leonora struggling to manage a lunch tray, a bottle of milk, a book.and a purse. Suddenly Snotty had\nappeared in front of Leonora - so arf slung\nrakishly around his neo k, duff le coat askew\nand with that one aided smile wh i oh she had\ncome to love so much, he had bowed1 low and\nin one sweeping movement relieved her of\nher purse. \"Tou look so beautiful in that\nwhite dress with the pea green soup stain showing off your slender neo k and shoulders\n- I can't resist helping you.\" He touched her elbow and a shiver went through\nher whole body wh i \u00abh set her pulses beating and sent the blood rushing to her\noh eek s. \"But I hardly know you,\" Leonora\nstammered, but by the end of lunch she\nfelt that she had known him for a long\ntime.

FOE SOME TEARS. KEITH MILLER, THE PRESIDENT OF GUILDS UNION LAST TEAR AND A PRIME MOTER\nIN THE FOUNDING OF THE EXPLORATION BOARD, WAS THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION H THE BOOSE OF COMMONS.\nDaring the debate it was announced that the\nban on Miller, imposed by the Pakistan Government,!\nhad been withdrawn. All I.C., knowing of the\ntremendous untiring effort he has made in getting the forthcoming expedition to the Himalayas\non a sound footing, will rejoice at this news.\nThere can be little doubt, however, that some\nof the facts behind the story are truly amazing.\nIt appears that news of Millar having been\nbanned was received some weeks ago by the senior\nmembers of the Exploration Board. Some attempt\nwas made to have the decision reversed, both\nobviously meeting with some difficulties, they\nreached a conclusion that this was impossible.\nIt is noteworthy at this stage to realize that\nduring this period, neither student members,\nnor any I.C. Union Officer, nor EVEN MILLER aU-SELF, were informed. Eventually the Exploration\nBoard informed Keith that, much as they naturally sym pathis ed with him, there was little or \\\nnothing he could do about it. In an endeavour\nto keep the whole event quiet, and so that no-one\nneed ever know, it was even suggested that Keith\nshould resign because of \" ill health\". Evan\nwithout knowing why Keith had been banned, the\nBoard advised him to accept the decision with as\nlittle fuss as possible.\nFor those who know Keith personally, it will be no surprise to hear that he did not take too\nkindly to this treatment. He visited the M.P. for Blackburn (his home town), Mrs. Barbara\nCastle, and the High Commissioner for Pakistan\nin England. He asked Mrs. Castle to raise the\nmatter in the House of Commons. In addition,\nKeith approached several College dignitaries\nfor help in providing references that might\nlend weight to his appeal. The student presidents and the Warden of the Hostel readily\nagreed to help, and letters were sent to Mrs.\nCastle, the High Commlsloner for Pakistan, and\nMr. A.H. Albu, who is an M.P. on the governing\nbody of the College. The letters explained\nthat, he Is not only a member of the expedition,!\nbut also its originator.\nMiller had been a valuable and industrious\nmember of college society during his stay at I.C. The letters asked that the ban be with dr w n or\nelse at least some reasonable explanation be\ngiven.\nThe lively discussion that took place in the House on May 9th. was fully reported in the\nTimes next day and mentioned in a number of the\nother daily papers. Mrs Castle asked a ma bar\nof questions about the nature of information\nthat is passed by the British Government to the\nGovernments of the Commonwealth in such circumstances and the right of appeal in such a case. She also asked questions about the Miller\ncase in particular. The discussion included a speech from Mr. Albu who spoke up for Keith and\nMr. Callaghan commented that the whole case\nsmacked of McCarthy!SB.\nA copy of Hansard has been purchased and\nplaced in the reading room for all those wh s would Ilka to read the proceedings la full. Tha result,as we now know was a resounding\ntriumph for Keith and his band of determined\nsupporters. Mr. Alport (Under Secretary of\nState for Commonwealth Ralatioas) announced that\nthe Pakistan Govexnaaat had withdrawn its objection to Miller( this wae pr asua abi y baaed on\ninformation supplied to them by tha British Government).\naxis WILLIS, whe was President of Guilds\nlast year obtained a 'first', and has beam\nworking at SugVy since.

Shortly after1 p.m. a fawn Morris\ntru ok was seen to app roa oh the Union at\nhigh speed from an Easterly direction.

It seems somehow strange\nthat in a week Mr. Miller has managed to reverse\nthe decision not te grant him a visa, when the\nExploration Board had failed to do so. Kitch was\ninformed that raising the matter In an endeavour\nto change the decision might only lead to mora\ntroubles and Keith jeo pardi sed even more rf the\nban became widespread knowledge.\nOn the face of it there can be only one answer\nthat the college in trying not to dirty its nose\nwith any public exposure aid it* hast initially\nti keep the whole procedure 'la camera'. Considering the position in which the college finds\nitself, that was understandable as long as Keith\ndid not know. However, when he had declared his\nIntention to have the whole matter thrashed oat,\nif need be at the highest level irrespective ef\nincidental risks, it was the college that should\nhave stood at his shoulder and given his whole\nhearted support.\nff l ffa HPSTPT continued on nags 2.\n\u2014 Hi i|i.) rH,- ib ably always wear - and oar ry in gpl a oar de explaining the purpose of their visit,e re seed the Beit Quadrangle and entered\nthe Union Bulldog by the door near the bar\nHopes for some goad sport In the bar were\nhowever dashed when the1 party turned left into the lounge.

This vehicle nude a return run\npast the Union at high speed scattering the assembled crowd.\nAt this point, civil war broke out.\nLong standing differences of opinion between the floors of the hostel became apparent as hostilities broke out. The oro wd in the road were treated to an enjoyable\ndisplay of water throwing. The President\nof I. C.W.

The first, in the last issue,\nwas expected to promote a flood of angry letters.\nThe response has been negligible.\nHaving been in the College for a sufficient\ntime to justify an opinion, it is mine that the\nstudent population shows an unwarranted lack of\nfamiliarity with the rules of English grammar\nand with spelling. One may find examples of this\ndeficiency in this very journal(although many of\nthe errors are typographical ones, it must be\nasserted). The opinion is quite widely held that\nschooling up to G.C.E. may be blamed.\nPassing from walking to running, examination\nof a fair sample of reports by undergraduates and\npostgraduates of their practical work shows that\nindustry might benefit if some formal instruction\nwere given in technical writing at the University\nstage.
