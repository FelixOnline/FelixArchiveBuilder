    "content": "felix M I L L E N N I A L S\n22 felixonline.co.uk/millennials millenniuals.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 5 May 2017\nI\n\u2019ll be honest that Jesus\u2019\ndeath break was so long\nthat I completely forgot that\nI write in this spunk-rag of\na newspaper and the two\ndualities that make up this\ncolumn must be awoken from\ntheir slumber. In order to do this I\nmust utter the fateful words which\nall felix writers utter before they\ncommit mirth and hilarity to page:\n\u201cNobody reads this except our\nparents, and people wanking\nto the centrefold during exam\nseason\u201d.\nListen up all you left-tards: in this\nstressful time of exams just know\nthat there are plenty of people\nwho you went to school with who\ndropped out after year twelve who\nare earning more money than you,\nown a car, probably happier, and\nprobably getting more sex than\nyou stuck in this shit hole. At least\nyou got two A*s in your A levels I\nguess. Maybe if you privately-edu-cated twats worked a day in your\nlife instead of worrying about\npronouns, you\u2019d be somewhere by\nnow instead of doing a master\u2019s\nand becoming a banker-wanker\nlike the rest of Imperial.\nBut let\u2019s talk Trump: although we\nmanaged to get him to the White\nHouse, the real battle is far from\nover. I can\u2019t believe how bad the\nmedia is attacking papa orange\nfor the minor shortcomings over\nthe past 100 days. If they had prohibited the women and the other\nminorities of the ethnic variety\nfrom working, then we wouldn\u2019t\nbe in the current, wall-lacking\npredicament we find ourselves in.\nA wall is the only thing that will\nkeep our burrito-buddies south of\nthe border, as these Mexicans are\njust so slippery from all that taco\ngrease, that any hole in the wall\nwill allow them to eel their way\ninto our country to rape, murder,\nand worst of all, force us to learn\nSpanish.\nCloser to home we are being\nforced to do the worst thing a\ndemocratic government can ever\nask you to do: vote again. When\nI heard that we were going to be\nobligated to fuck up our country\nfor the second time in a year,\nall I could do was groan and\nhalf-heartedly bash one out to the\npapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 bust of Margaret\nThatcher in my kitchen. Perhaps\nwhen Theresa May finally allows\nthe demon inside her to manifest\nitself in physical form then MAYBE\nwe can hurry up to the deporting\nof anyone who looks too dark\nto be from these fair Isles. As for\nme, I plan on deporting my Greek\neditor as soon as possible. Maybe\nthen we can finally clear all the\nsmashed plates and get rid of the\nstench of olives from the office and\nactually get some work done.\nI\nam completely overjoyed, dear\nreaders, and it has nothing\nto do with the hemp-infused\nEaster eggs I\u2019ve been inserting\ninto my rectum. We have\nfinally made actual progress in\ndefeating the rise of fascism. First\nof all, this election: now the British\npublic has woken up to the lies\nand deceit that was Brexit and the\nConservative party, we can finally\nsort this shit out and great comrade\nCorbyn can finally assume his\nrightful place at 10 Kremlin street.\nOnce Jezza comes into power,\nhe will redistribute the wealth\n(somehow) and by doing that he\nwill be able to afford all the things\nhe is promising to spend money\non despite having no plan. By the\nlooks of Jeremy\u2019s snapchat he is\nhard at work speaking to his key\nelectorate that are unconvinced:\nbabies. Sure, perhaps they won\u2019t\nsway the election in quite the\nway we would hope, but Jeremy\nis playing the long game, way\ninto the future when the Labour\nparty has disintegrated under his\nmisguided idealism. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll\nmake Freddos cheaper as well.\nThen there\u2019s Trump: first 100 days\nin office were a complete failure\nso we can impeach him basically\nand if Hillary isn\u2019t busy giving\ntalks to Wall Street, I\u2019m sure she\ncould move into his place almost\nimmediately. We would finally\nhave a female president, although\nthe main work for her would be\nto make sure everyone uses the\nright suffixes and pronouns when\naddressing the presidentress.\nAfter that, perhaps she can spend\nsome time repairing relationships\nwith North Korea but, you know,\npriorities. It also seems as though\nthis wall fantasy Agent Orange\nhad envisioned is dead in the\nwater and nothing is to come of\nit. Frankly this is good because I\njust feel like (if I may first check my\nprivilege) the noble Latin people\njust make the best burritos. I think\nthat mother Gaia blessed them\nwith the right size fingers to wrap\nseitan slices in a gluten-free wrap.\nAlso they do bring the best ganja\nthis side of Jamaica (Jah Rastafah).\nThe next couple of months will\nbe long and turbulent for all you\nexam-takers, but just remember\nthat a piece of paper can never\ntruly define who you are as a\nperson. Unless that piece of\npaper is instructing you to stay\n500 metres away from schools\nat all times, then you\u2019re probably\ndefined as a paedo.\nThings are looking up\nboi\nJonathan Masters is finally\noptimistic about the the state of\nthe world... kind of\nWe\u2019re only 100\ndays in but things\nare looking\ngoooood\nMonathan Jasters talks\ncontingency plans for in case the\nleft takes over.\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nTheresa May\u2019s\nHair Salon\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAre millennials\ntoo entitled or do\nwe just deserve\nbetter?\nTessa Davey thinks that millennial\nentitlement is a good thing\nT\nhe media is\nobsessed with\nmillennials being\nmore entitled\nthan previous\ng e n e r a t i o n s ,\nwhat with all those years of\npraise, encouragement, and\nsocial media. It\u2019s a great\nrhetoric: we\u2019re all narcissistic\nnightmares, who are too\nobsessed with our personal\nbrand and too lazy to put our\nheads down and memorise\nthings that we could easily\nGoogle.\nMaybe we are more entitled,\nbut I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a bad\nthing. I don\u2019t think millennials\nhave an expectation of having\nthings handed to us, but we are\ninstead more willing to fight for\nthings than generations before\nus who weren\u2019t so hell-bent on\nchanging the world.\nI\u2019ve been at Imperial for a\nlong time, and when I started\ntherewerestillstudentsfiltering\nthrough the system who paid\nonly \u00a31,000 of tuition fees\na year. I paid just over three\ngrand a year, and while I\nwill obviously be paying this\nback for the next couple of\ndecades, I don\u2019t think I got a\nbad deal. The teaching might\nnot all have been great (some\nmay have been terrible) but\nwe just got on with it and\nultimately I graduated with\na very reputable Master\u2019s\ndegree that certainly has\nincreased my lifetime earning\npotential far more than the\nstudent loan I\u2019ve amassed.\nBut this was back in 2008,\nand now higher education\nis a lot more expensive for a\nset of young people who are\nfar more socially aware and\ninformed than I ever was at\ntheir age.\nOf course, I\u2019m part of\nthe generation that was\nheartbroken by the Lib Dem\nbetrayal when tuition fees shot\nup. With English degree debt\nnow the highest in the world,\nthe average student paying\n\u00a39,000 a year for university\ncan expect to owe more than\n\u00a344,000 by the time they\ngraduate. This increase made\nmuch more of a difference\nthan the small and gradual\nfee rises that crept up before.\n\\\\ We are becoming\nincreasingly entitled because\nwe realise that if we want\nto get anything we have to\ndemand it and fight for it \\\\\nAlthough theoretically there\nare more student loans,\nbursaries, and there is more\nsupport available now, paying\nthat much for university is a\nbig deal, and students are\nexpecting a lot more for their\nmoney.\nThanks to a greater collective\nawareness, post-\u00a39000\nstudents have mobilised,\ndemanding higher quality\nteaching than the years of\nstudents before them ever got.\nThey\u2019re getting aggro at poor\nfeedback, suing universities\nover inadequate supervision,\nand generally throwing their\ntoys out of the pram about not\ngetting what they think they\ndeserve. Do you think that we\nhad the privilege of watching\nPanopto lectures in bed while\nannotating the conveniently\ndistributed course handouts\non our iPads? We had to show\nup at 9am and copy down\nnotes from a blackboard while\ntrying not to choke on chalk\ndust if we sat near the front.\nWe didn\u2019t have guaranteed\nfeedback within two weeks,\nand we had barely any contact\nhours that didn\u2019t consist of\nsitting with 250 other people\nin a lecture theatre, and we\ndidn\u2019t complain.\nBut do you know what? We\nwere fucking stupid not to do\nso. A lot of the poor teaching\nwe had was subpar to the\npoint of unacceptable, with\nlecturers being prevented\nfrom teaching after they\u2019d\ndoomed a whole class to an\naverage exam mark that was\nscaled up to 40% and an\noften completely nonsensical\ncourse structure.\nPoor teaching isn\u2019t the fault\nof lecturers who don\u2019t care\nabout students. It\u2019s difficult\nfor teaching staff. I\u2019ve seen\nboth sides and I get it.\nTeaching staff are overworked\nbecause, to oversimplify,\nCollege prioritises research\nover teaching. It brings in\nmore money, and it makes a\nbigger impact on our global\nreputation. But College\nwouldn\u2019t exist were it not for\nthe students, who have the\nability to lobby for change\nas they effectively hold\nCollege to ransom. There has\nbeen so much development\nand change in the teaching\nstandards at Imperial over the\nlast few years as more and\nmore students have become\nentitled enough to ask for it,\nbut the quality of teaching is\nstill hugely variable.\nI have so much admiration\nfor the students who came\nafter me who took control of\ntheir education and fought for\nbetter teaching. The ones who\nare bothered to fill out SOLE\nand tear any terrible teaching\nto shreds; the ones who leave\nfeedback and ask for more\nresources; the ones who have\nstood up and lobbied College\nto give them value for money;\nthey have absolutely earned\nthe better teaching that they\nare getting (although of\n\\\\ They\u2019re getting\naggro at poor\nfeedback, suing\nuniversities over\ninadequate\nsupervision, and\ngenerally throwing\ntheir toys out of the\npram \\\\\ncourse, there is still a long way\nto go).\nBut at the same time, many\nof the students who came\nafter me are little shits who\nseem to be chronically unable\nto check their emails and\nreply appropriately like the\nadults they are. For all their\ninternet literacy, they seem\nto be too lazy to read the\nhandouts carefully or perform\na basic Google search before\nrunning to teaching staff, or\nto stop scrolling Instagram\nto give their full attention to\na tutorial. You deserve of a\ngood education, but you are\nnot entitled to being spoon-fed\nthe answers, and university is\na step up from school where\nyou do have to manage\nyour own learning to some\nextent. Having identified a\nvalid demand, some students\nare regressing back into\nschoolchildren, forgetting that\nwhen you come to university\nyou have to at least pretend to\nbe a grownup and not waste\nthe time of those providing\nyour education.\nThose who shit on millennials\nare wrong \u2013 we aren\u2019t entitled\nbecause we\u2019ve always been\nhanded things on a plate. We\nare becoming increasingly\nentitled because we realise\nthat if we want to get anything\nwe have to demand it and\nfight for it, and the more\nconnected we all are, the\neasier this becomes. Channel\nyour deserved entitlement into\nfighting for a better education,\nbut don\u2019t think that a better\neducation means that anyone\nis going to do the work for\nyou.\n\\\\ You deserve a\ngood education, but\nyou are not entitled\nto be spoon-fed the\nanswers, and at\nuniversity you do\nhave to step up and\nmanage your own\nlearning \\\\\n\n"

The sigh dissipated\ninto thin air as the navy blue\nwas replaced by a cloudless,\ncornflower blue. A few wisps of\ncoral-coloured cotton candy clouds\ndrifted past. It was 6pm and it was\nbright outside.\nA white, delicate petal from a\nplum blossom tree flew with the\nlight breeze, swirling around in\nmid-air like a fairy. It wasn\u2019t \u2018till\nthen when I realized that it was\nno longer winter anymore. South\nKensington had awakened from\nits hibernation and blossomed into\nspring.\nI always believed that our palette\nchanges with the seasons, so it\u2019s\ntime for a refreshing change! This\nprawn, lemon and asparagus\ntagliatelle is the perfect dish to\ncelebrate those breezy, sunny\nafternoons, or a fix for those grey\ndrizzly days. The lemon brightens\nup anyone\u2019s mood while the dash\nof cream embraces all the flavours\ntogether.\nIngredients (two servings):\nJuice of 1 lemon (plus some peel and a\nfew slices for garnishing)\n110g fine asparagus, chopped into\n1-inch long sections\n250g of prawns\n2 cloves of garlic, minced\nA pinch of crushed chilli, salt and\npepper\n100ml double cream\n250g tagliatelle, linguine or spaghetti\nMethod\nCook your pasta according to the\ninstructions on the packet, drain.\nMeanwhile, heat up some olive\noil in a big pan, pan-fry the\nprawns until slightly pink. Remove\nand set aside.\nSaut\u00e9 the asparagus, add the\nminced garlic and crushed chilli\nAdd a dash of pasta water, allow\nto simmer for 2 minutes on low\nheat.\nAdd the prawns and the cream,\ngrated lemon peel and the lemon\njuice.\nStir and allow to bubble gently.\nStir in the pasta, season with salt\nand pepper.\nEnjoy!\nAndrada Balmez\nChristy Lam\nI\nhope you\u2019ve enjoyed hunting\nfor Easter chocolate eggs and\nthat you don\u2019t feel sorry for\nnot letting your younger sister\nget more than two. Good job,\nby the way. But now that you\nare out of your sugar coma, it\u2019s\ntime to start wondering what you\nare supposed to do with all those\nkilos of chocolate you\u2019ve acquired\nover the past month. I\u2019m not saying\nthat you can\u2019t just eat them \u2013 God,\nforbid! \u2013 but maybe it\u2019s time to\nfeel like a decent human again. At\nleast for a little bit.\nIngredients:\n300g chocolate\nSalt\n300 ml double cream\n100 g sugar\nAmaretto (to taste, but remember that\nyou are trying to make mousse, not\nget drunk)\n1 tbsp (good quality) cocoa powder\nFirst, smash up the chocolate into\nrelatively small pieces \u2013 yes, it\u2019s\ntime to unleash all the anger you\nhave inside on the poor choco-late. Afterwards, simply melt it in\nbain-marie (do I have to explain\nthis to you?). Actually, just go for\nstudents\u2019 best friend: melt carefully\nin the microwave. Depending on\nyour skill in the kitchen, you might\nwant to add a little bit of butter,\nbut this is not necessary.\nMix the double cream and the\nsugar in a separate bowl. Add\nthe salt and the cocoa powder.\nWhen well-mixed, add the melted\nchocolate and keep mixing. This is\nthe moment when you should taste\nit and make sure it does not need\nany finishing touches. You are still\nallowed to add extra sugar or a\npinch of salt. It\u2019s really hard to give\ndirections when you are using a\nchocolate mix \u2013 assuming that you\nare using the Easter leftovers and\nnot some baking chocolate chips.\nFinally, add some good old\nAmaretto. Up to taste, really. But\nyou should also keep an eye on\nthe consistency as you don\u2019t want\nit to go liquid on you. Pour it in a\nfancy cup and decorate with nuts,\npistachios or anything else you\nfancy (I normally go for the nut\nand strawberries variety). Let it\nsit in the fridge for at least three\nhours \u2013 it depends on the size of\nthe serving. Consume!\nTime to get rid of all that chocolate you\ncouldn\u2019t finish and have been hoarding all\nEaster? Want to eat it but finding yourself\nat the verge of bursting? felix has found the\nperfect solution for you!\nEaster egg hunting\n\n"

To name but a\nfew, Nothings Into Somethings (where we hear him\nreveal the tension that exists\nbetween himself and an ex\n\u2013 thought to be Serena Williams \u2013 who is now engaged),\nLose You (where we hear\nhim bemoaning the fact that\nhis commitment to rap has\ncaused distance from family,\nfriends and lovers) and Since\nWay Back (where we hear\nhim link up with PARTYNEXTDOOR). I would argue 808s\n& Heartbreak by Kanye West\nwas the first successful emotional rap album, but Drake\nhas since turned \u2018emo rap\u2019\ninto his own niche on which\nhe\u2019s been able to build the\nfoundation of his career and,\nin turn, influence countless\nartists. In a genre in which\nhyper-masculinity is the norm,\nhe\u2019s made it acceptable for\nrappers to show vulnerability\nand emotion through their\nmusic. Lyrics like \u201cI just take\nthe dreams I\u2019ve been sold and\nsell \u2018em for more\u201d on Glow\n(the Kanye-assisted track\nwhere they rap about how far\nthey\u2019ve come in the industry\nand how they\u2019re going to\ncontinue to shine, or \u2018glow\u2019,\nfor years to come), \u201cOut of\nbody / that\u2019s just how I feel\nwhen I\u2019m around you shawty\u201d\non Teenage Fever (an R&B\nballad which samples Jennifer\nLopez\u2019s classic If You Had My\nLove) and \u201cEverything these\ndays is textual / I just want\nto get a lil\u2019 sexual with you\u201d\non Since Way Back sound\nlike ready-made Instagram\ncaptions and make me want\nto text exes I don\u2019t even have.\nSomehow, Drake has made\nbeing moist cool and he continues to exploit this to great\neffect throughout this project.\nDrake\u2019s recent obsession\nwith UK urban culture and its\nsubsequent influence on his\nmusic is evident throughout\nA\nfter countless\ndelays\n(something\nwhich is\nseemingly\nbecoming\nan unfortunate feature of all\nDrake releases these days),\nMore Life was finally released\non 18th\nMarch. My excitement\nwas palpable to say the\nleast. In my opinion, Drake\u2019s\nwork often falls victim to his\nown procrastination and\nhype, raising expectations\nto unattainable heights and,\nbefore even listening to his\nlatest offering, I already\nhad countless questions:\nWill it live up to the massive\nexpectations? Who or what\nis this mysterious \u2018October\nFirm\u2019? What makes this\nrelease a playlist, not an\nalbum? More Life is a\ngargantuan 22 tracks long so\nthere\u2019s a lot to unpack. Let\u2019s\nget into it.\nDrake kicks off More Life\nwith Free Smoke, a hype\ntrack whose intro is a sample\nof Nai Palm\u2019s soulful voice\nfrom Hiatus Kaiyote\u2019s track,\nBuilding a Ladder. After this\nsmooth intro, we hear \u201cAnd\nmore chune for your headtop,\nso watch how you speak\non my name you know\u201d, a\nsoundbite of Drake\u2019s ominous\nmessage for his competitors\nfrom his acceptance speech at\nthe American Music Awards.\nDrizzy then launches into\nstraight bars, using the rest of\nthe track to proclaim his dominance over the rap game\nand even sneaking in a few\nmore shots at Meek Mill in the\nprocess (\u201cHow you let the kid\nthis project. UK singer-song-writer Jorja Smith has a\ntrack named after her (Jorja\nInterlude), and we hear her\nsilky vocals take centre stage\non Get it Together. There\u2019s\nalso the hauntingly beautiful\n4422 sung entirely by UK\nsinger Sampha (whose debut\nalbum, Process, bangs by\nthe way) and Grime king\nSkepta spits some venomous\nbars on Skepta\u2019s Interlude.\nPromising young South\nLondon rapper Dave (whose\ntrack Wanna Know got the\n\u20186 God remix\u2019 treatment) can\neven be heard talking on\nthe outro of Teenage Fever.\nWe were told in advance by\nNineteen85, producer and\nmember of OVO R&B duo\ndvsn, that Drake would use\nControlla and I suspect that\nthis new Jamaican Drake\nis here to stay. Drake can\neasily adapt to make any\ngenre his own (just listen to\nhis guest verse on his recent\ncollaboration with Wizkid,\nCome Closer), and his ability\nto try his hand at new genres\nyet simultaneously keep it\nquintessentially Drake is a testament to his versatility as an\nartist. Having said that, Drake\nneeds to be careful that, by\ndabbling in all these different\ngenres, he doesn\u2019t become a\n\u2018jack of all trades but master\nof none\u2019 parody of himself.\nDrake is often criticised for\nbeing a \u2018culture vulture\u2019 \u2013\nsomeone that jumps on the\nwave, exploiting whatever\ncraze is popping in rap for\nas long as it\u2019s popular before\nmoving on to the next fad-and, although I think labelling\nhim a \u2018culture vulture\u2019 label is\nharsh, I do think that Aubrey\nis a bit of a beg, to put it\nbluntly. Although receiving a\nco-sign from the 6 god can\nseem like a dream come true\nfor an artist, this seemingly\nselfless act of \u2018putting an artist\non\u2019 has actually proved to be\nself-serving on Drake\u2019s part,\nwith artists like iLoveMakon-nen falling foul of the 6 God\nco-sign curse in the past.\nThis makes me even more\nsceptical about his bizarre\nobsession with UK culture.\nIt was recently revealed\nthat Drake has bought the\nrights to and will be starring\nin season 3 of Top Boy, the\ngritty Channel 4 drama\nabout London gangs. He\u2019s\nalso apparently opening an\nOVO store, the first of its kind\nworldwide, in London. With\nDrake, we know that, in order\nto remain at the summit of hip-hop, every move has to be\nmeticulously calculated and\nI can\u2019t tell if Drake\u2019s recent\ninfatuation with London is\ngenuine love or all just a\nMore Life to \u201cintroduce new\nmusic and new artists to the\nrest of the world\u201d. Drizzy\nclearly felt the need to shine\nlight and show love to the\nGrime & UK music scene as\na whole, hence the strong\nUK presence on the playlist.\nHowever, this tactic may\nhave backfired on Drake,\nwith many American fans\ntaking to Twitter to complain\nabout the amount of Grime\ninfluence on the album. Giggs\nin particular has received a\nlot of backlash online from\nAmerican fans who simply\ndon\u2019t understand why lyrics\nlike \u201cAnd you already know I\nlove them breasts, lookin\u2019 all\nperky\u201d and \u201cBatman, da-nana-da-na\u201d on KMT get us UK\nfans so gassed.\nOn More Life, Drake also\nshows his appreciation for the\nCaribbean influence that has\nbecome such a staple part of\nhis recent music and success,\nwith the \u2018Jamaican Drake\u2019\nthat we were introduced to\n\\\\ Drake has since\nturned \u2018emo rap\u2019\ninto his own niche\non which he\u2019s been\nable to build the\nfoundation of his\ncareer and, in turn,\ninfluence countless\nartists \\\\\nfightin\u2019 ghostwritin\u2019 rumours\nturn you to a ghost?\u201d). The\nhigh-energy start continues\nwith the thumping 808s of\nNo Long Talk, one of my\nfavourite tracks on More Life,\nand the first time we hear UK\n\\\\ Drake\u2019s work\noften falls victim\nto his own\nprocrastination\nand hype, raising\nexpectations\nto unattainable\nheights \\\\\n\\\\ Aubrey is a bit\nof a beg, to put it\nbluntly \\\\\non Views taking the reins for\nMadiba Riddim and Blem.\nBoth tracks feature smooth,\ntropical, dancehall-type beats\nsimilar to that of his 2016 hit\n\n"

Rice paper\nShoji (screen doors) form\nthe centrepiece of the stage,\nslowly opening and closing,\nreshaping the stage, repo-sitioning characters from\nthe dark nights to fragrant spring gardens.\nThe lights create\nsoft gradients of\nblues and oranges\nwhich Cio-CioSan (Ermonela\nJaho), usually clad in white or\npale pastels, gracefully dips\nin and out of.\nThe costumes, too, are\nsimple and elegant. It is this\nsimplicity that clashes with\nthe over-dramatisation of\nsome of the performances\n(we get it, you\u2019re a butterfly\n\u2013 stop flapping your kimono\nsleeves now please), causing\ndissonance and drawing\nattention to some of the more\nproblematic elements of\nPuccini\u2019s opera.

Its complex\nrelationship with the rest of\nthe world can be put down to\nits history and the governing\nKim dynasty.\nNorth and South Korea\nwere founded in the confused\naftermath of the Japanese\nsurrender in 1945. The Soviet\nand US armies occupied the\ncountry up to the 38th\nparallel\nnorthandbeganadministering\nthe two zones separately.\nAlthough there were plans for\nan eventual reunification of\nthe whole peninsula, the onset\nof the Cold War prevented\nthis. Therefore in 1948 two\nseparate states were set\nup: North Korea under the\nleadership of Kim Il-Sung and\n\\\\ By adopting\nnuclear weapons\ncapable of striking\ntheir enemies,\nthey are able to\nadopt the MAD\ndoctrine, and thus\nrender themselves\ninvulnerable to\nenemy attacks \\\\\nSouth Korea under Syngman\nRhee. Both states were\nsupported by the relevant\nideological superpowers, the\nNorth by communist China\nand the Soviet Union and the\nSouth by the US and NATO.\nBoth states had the desire\nfor a reunified Korea, and\nin 1950 the North decided\nthat a military invasion of the\nSouth would achieve this.\nThe war ended in 1953, with\nboth sides more or less back\nat their starting positions, but\nnever officially made peace,\ncontributing to the climate\nof suspicion and barely\ncontained aggression that\ncontinues to the present day.\nIn 2012, a new ruler, Kim\nJong-Un, ascended to the\nthrone as the newest dictator.\nSince then North Korea has\nbeen increasing frequency\nand brazenness with which it\ncarries out both missile tests\nand nuclear detonations, with\nthe goal being that of nuclear\nweapons that can hit America.\nTo put this in a strategic\ncontext, the ultimate aim of\nthe North is the reunification\nof Korea and the total security\nof the state. In order to do\nthat, it will need to conquer\nthe South while in turn\nbeing immune from foreign\naggression. It cannot muster\noverwhelming force militarily\nwhen compared to the forces\nof its potential enemies, nor\ncan it rely on past allies such\nas China to supplement its\nmilitary strength.\nBy adopting nuclear\nweapons capable of striking\ntheir enemies, they are able\nto adopt the MAD doctrine,\nand thus render themselves\ninvulnerable to enemy attacks\nunless those enemies want to\ngo nuclear. Nuclear weapons\nwould also enable the North\nto threaten other states with\na nuclear strike in order to\nobtain economic or territorial\nconcessions, for example\nremoving trade restrictions, or\nsurrendering South Korea in its\nentirety to the North. Overall,\nthe prospect of a nuclear\narmed North is bleak and\nterrifying for its opponents,\nleaving no checks or balances\non the regime.\nTherefore, what can be done\nabout North Korea? Currently\nthe approach is the \u201csoft\u201d\nmethod, embargoes on the\nregime. This has impacted the\nNorth Korean economy by\ndenying it access to Western\nmarkets, but it remains\nfunctional mainly due to the\nsupport of China.\nChina is an ally of the North,\nhaving fought unofficially\nbeside it in the Korean war.\nTrade with China accounts for\n83% of the North\u2019s exports\nand 85% of its imports\n(OECD data), giving China\na considerable amount of\neconomic influence. Although\nChina is showing signs of\nimpatience with its nuclear\nambitions \u2013 it refused a\nshipment of coal from the\nNorth recently \u2013 it is unwilling\nto halt trade completely\nand collapse the country\u2019s\neconomy entirely. Therefore,\nsanctions remain ineffective.\nAnother option that is\ncurrently under consideration\nis a military invasion of the\npeninsula. This would be\ncostly, and it is doubtful that\nthere is the political will for\nsuch a sacrifice. There is also\nthe fact that North Korea\nhave a considerable amount\nof heavy artillery aimed at\nthe South Korean capital of\nSeoul at all times, capable of\nreducing it to rubble. Russia\nand China would also be\nreluctant to sanction such\nan engagement as it would\nalter the strategic balance\nof the region, placing US\ntroops right on their border.\nThe recent deployment of a\nTHAAD anti-missile system met\nconsiderable opposition from\nboth countries, so imagine\nthe objection if the whole of\nNATO turned up at the 38th\nparallel.\nA third option is turning\nPyonyang into radioactive\nrubble, but this is even more\nunlikely than a land invasion.\nNo one wants to cremate\nKorea quite yet.\nEssentially, North Korea has\nall the cards. China is unwilling\nto risk destabilising North\nKorea or allowing a greater\namount of US influence in\nthe region by a strengthened\nSouth Korea. This protects\nNorth Korea from the effects of\nWestern sanctions. War is not\nviable due to reluctance from\nthe West and the influence of\nRussia and China.\nNorth Korea will continue to\ndevelop its nuclear weapons in\nrelative peace, until it is ready\nto use them. Dialogue with the\nregime will be critical in order\nto attempt to make it more\nopen and less fond of nuking\nthe world to a nice radioactive\norange.Thisdialoguewillhave\nto come from both China and\nthe US if it there is any chance\nof North Korea not possessing\nthe ability to destabilise the\nKorean peninsula and the\nwider far east.\n\\\\ The Korean War ended in\n1953, with both sides more\nor less back at their starting\npositions, but never officially\nmade peace \\\\\n\\\\ An option is\nturning Pyonyang\ninto radioactive\nrubble, but this is\neven more unlikely\nthan a land invasion.\nNo one wants to\ncremate Korea quite\nyet \\\\\n\\\\ The prospect of\na nuclear armed\nNorth is bleak and\nterrifying \\\\\n\\\\ North Korea has\nbeen increasing\nthe frequency and\nbrazenness with\nwhich it carries out\nboth missile tests and\nnuclear detonations,\nwith the goal being\nthat of nuclear\nweapons that can hit\nAmerica \\\\\n\n"

By\ncontrast, Heroes\u2019 story is a\npaper-thin and there are only\nthree or four characters that\nare really integral to the plot.\nIf you really want a truly fun\nand immersive experience,\nyou\u2019re better off buying any\nof the other Fire Emblem\ngames.\nHaving said that, the mobile\nversion does pack a really\ncool exclusive feature which\nallows you to use and play\nwith any of the characters\nfrom Fire Emblem\u2019s long\nhistory. This gives the game\nthe same fun \u2018collect \u2018em all\u2019\naspect that\u2019s made Pok\u00e9mon\nso popular. The only problem\nthis causes is that all the\nfan-favourite characters have\na rarer occurrence rate, so\nyou\u2019ll probably spend your\ntime getting mostly C-list\ncharacters. Adding insult to\ninjury is the fact that these\nrare popular characters are\nobjectively better than your\naverage C-lister. So playing\nwith a unit you\u2019re not a great\nfan of when in addition they\nobstacles and sometimes\nhave to deal with enemies\nwho just keep on coming. Fire\nEmblem Heroes by contrast,\nis much more simplified and\nsmall-scale. You only control\nfour units at a time and the\n\\\\ You need to\nplan ahead and be\nstrategic about how\nyou play \\\\\nUnited, we attack! \\\\ Nintendo\nFire Emblem Heroes is free\non Android and iOS\nmap is small enough to fill\nyour entire screen. This means\neach round is shorter yet\nthis makes it a much better\nfit for mobile platforms. You\nopen the game, get a quick\nten-minute fix and you\u2019re\nback to whatever you were\nworking on. Unless you have\nterrible self-control, in which\ncase before you know it you\u2019ll\nhave spent a good hour on it.\nThis game doesn\u2019t have the\nrandom number generators\nthat have been known to\nmake the original games frustrating as heck. Also absent\nare the more subtle features,\nsuch as weapons durability,\npermadeath, and unit pairing.\nThe more simple nature of this\ngame takes away from the\nexcitement of trying to get\nthrough difficult levels, but on\nthe other hand, this it makes\nHeroes more accessible for\n\\\\ Use and play\nwith any of the\ncharacters from\nFire Emblem\u2019s long\nhistory \\\\\ncan\u2019t even pack a punch, can\nget old fast. Still, overall, the\nfeature is nice and there\u2019s a\nreal novelty to seeing characters from different games all\nwork together in your team.\nOutside of the story, there\u2019s\nplenty you can do to level\nup your characters and have\nfun. You can fight it out in\nthe Training Tower or battle\nwith other people\u2019s teams in\nthe Battle Arena. There\u2019s lots\nof rewards you can earn to\nincentivise you to keep playing and the game mechanics\nare such that you never truly\nfeel stuck. There\u2019s also always\nsomething you can do or a\nfreebie you can get that can\nhelp you make your way\nforward.\nFire Emblem Heroes may not\nbe perfect but it\u2019s definitely a\nfun experience and a good\nstart of bringing the experience to smartphones and\ntablets. Despite its shortcom-ings, the spectacularly fun\nbattles and ability to meet old\nFire Emblem friends makes\nthis game worth the free\ndownload.\n\n"

As it is\nstored in a fridge there is no\nchance that the fumes will be\nextracted.\nAcryloyl chloride is fatal\nif inhaled and is also a\nlachrymator (induces tears),\nmaking it difficult to clean up\nand generally deal with safely\nin the case of a leak.\nThe March incident was a\nresult of a bottle put in the\nfridge by a PI who has now\nleft the department. The bottle\nwas forgotten, ultimately\nleading to the polymerisation\nof the acryloyl chloride\ncontained within and the\nrelease of hydrochloric acid\nfumes. Staff has been advised\nto check fridges and ensure\nthe disposal of any forgotten/\nunused acryloyl chloride.\nThe same advice has been\nissued with stores of Acryloyl\nchloride (contains MEHQ as\nstabiliser), Acryloyl chloride\n\\\\ This is the second\nincident of this\nnature, involving\nthis particular\nsubstance in the last\n18 months \\\\\nChemical spill culprit confirmed New Dean\nnew day\nnew life for\nEngineering\nS\ntarting this October,\nCollege will be\nwelcoming Prof.\nNigel Brandon as\nits new Engineering\nDean.

Brandon will be\nreplacing Prof. Jeff Magee\nwho\u2019s held the role of Dean\nsince 2011. He\u2019s been serving\nas Vice-Dean (Research) for\nthe past year.\nIn a press release, the\nProvost James Stirling\nwelcomed Brandon calling\nhim \u201cthe ideal person to\nlead the Faculty through this\nexciting next stage\u201d.

    "content": "felix C U L T U R E\n14 felixonline.co.uk/culture culture.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 5 May 2017\nT\nhey are just a\ngang of back-chat comedians\ndeliberately\nundermining\nmorale with this\nimpertinent, unpatriotic rag.\u201d\nSo goes Lieutenant Colonel\nHowfield\u2019s complaint about\nThe Wipers Times, a satirical\ntrench newspaper brought\nto life in the Arts Theatre\nthanks to Ian Hislop and Nick\nNewman.\nJames Dutton is somewhat\nreminiscent of Alan Alda in\nM*A*S*H, playing Captain\nFred Roberts who remains\ndefiantly cheerful in the face\nof the horrors of his daily life\nyet is still privately vulnerable\nand afraid of what might\nhappen in the very uncertain\nfuture. George Kemp is\nduring a Q&A session after\none performance. The jokes\nare a stark contrast between\nterrible puns and what Hislop\ndescribes as a \u201csharp, black,\ncallous, extraordinary level of\nhumour.\u201d\nThis dichotomy sets the tone\nof the show, which sandwiches the heart-breaking\npoignancy you would expect\nfrom a World War I drama\nbetween surreal sketches and\ncomic music hall routines. It\nis refreshing to see that the\nentire cast is strong throughout these song-and-dance\nnumbers. These musical\ninterludes (used to glide from\none scene to the next) are all\noriginal compositions from\nNick Green and take poetry\ndirectly from the pages of the\nnewspaper as their lyrics.\nAlmost as unexpected is\nthe large number of women\nin amongst the uniformed\nTommies. If I counted cor-rectly, Clio Davies and Emilia\nWilliams rotate between nine\ndistinct female roles. In fact\nalmost everyone in the cast\nswitches effortlessly between\nmultiple roles, whether that\nbe between major roles\n(when not busy printing The\nWipers Times as Sergeant\nTyler, Tetsell is promoted to\nGeneral Mitford and the\nDeputy Features Editor of the\nDaily News) or doubling up\nas a host in the fantasy hippo-dromes of Roberts\u2019 mind.\nAlso to be saluted is\nthe genuine camaraderie\ndepicted between the men of\nthe 24th\nDivision, particularly\nHenderson (Kevin Brewer),\nBarnes (Jake Morgan), and\nnew recruit Dodd (Peter\nLosasso). The credit for the\nbest scene in the show however has to go to Sam Ducane\nand Ross McLaren, portraying jumped-up army sticklers\nLieutenant Colonel Howfield and his aide-de-camp\nBobbing Bobby. Roberts and\nhis men can barely keep a\nstraight face as Howfield\n(who is adamantly against\nthe publication) asks if\nRoberts thinks the division\nis being offensive enough.\nDucane also makes a rather\nwonderful (albeit incredibly\nbrief) appearance as the most\nstereotypical Frenchman you\ncould possibly imagine but I\u2019ll\nleave you without context for\nthat one.\nOne of the piece\u2019s stronger\npoints is its scope for\nLost Gem\nRediscovered\n| The Wipers\nTimes\nJoanna Wormald\nThe Wipers Times is at the Arts Theatre\nuntil the 13th\nMay and will tour the UK for\nthe remainder of 2017\n'The Wipers Times' Play by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman performed // Arts Theatre, London\na perfect complement as\nLieutenant Jack Pearson, who\ncautions and encourages\nRoberts in equal measure.\nUpon discovering a printing\npress, the pair decide to set\nup a weekly newspaper. Their\nendeavours are enabled by\nSergeant Tyler (Dan Tetsell),\nwho conveniently worked as\na Fleet Street printer before\nwar broke out. Despite complete editorial inexperience\n(and the difficulties that come\nwith working in the middle\nof a warzone), Roberts and\nPearson managed to print 23\nissues of The Wipers Times\n(named after the mispronunciation of Ypres by the British\nsoldiers) from its inception in\n1917 to the end of the war in\n1918.\nOver the 100 years that\nhave since passed, The\nWipers Times and its creators\nwere largely forgotten. Until\nHislop found a copy of the\npaper whilst working on a\nRadio 4 documentary.\n\u201cNeither of us had seen\nanything like it before\nbecause it was so surprising\nto find that people were\nmaking jokes at all in that situation.\u201d Newman explained\nimprovisation.

Don\u2019t\nstand by in silence and watch\nas the mountain of debt you\nfind yourself in continues to\ninsidiously grow around you\nand overshadow your future.\nThe choices this country\nmakes at the ballot box have\na demonstrable impact on\nall of our lives, so don\u2019t lose\nyour voice \u2013 make the choice\nto stand up for your interests,\nand register to vote for the\nchange you want to see.\nY\nou probably\nmissed the\nmemo, buried\ndeep under a\npile of revision\nnotes but the\nfact remains: The cost of your\ndegree has just increased.\nInterest rates on student\nloans have risen by around a\nthird \u2013 up from 4.6% to 6.1%.\nThe reason for the increase\nstems from changes first\nintroduced in 2012 to the way\nstudent loans are repaid. The\nnew policy links the interest\nrate payable on student loans\nto the Retail Price Index (RPI)\n+ 3%.\nThe erratic nature of the\nU.K. economy since the EU\nreferendum last year has seen\nthe value of the pound fall, and\nwith it the RPI has increased\nto 3.1%; this is compared to\n1.6% last year, and 0.9% the\nprevious year.\nWhat this really means for\nstudents is that the level of\ndebt we will accumulate by the\ntime we graduate will increase\nin very real terms \u2013 before in\nfact, we even begin paying\nanything back. So let\u2019s say\nyou started your degree three\nyears ago with annual tuition\nfees at a base rate of \u00a39,000.\nAfter one year you\u2019d have to\npay back your tuition fees plus\nthe interest rate (3.9% at the\ntime) coming up to a total of\n\u00a39,351. Assuming tuition fees\nand interest rate remained the\nsame over the course of your\nthree year degree, by the end\nof it you\u2019d have racked up a\ntotal debt of \u00a329,160 (or the\ninitial \u00a327,000 of tuition fees\nplus an additional \u00a32,160\nworth of interest). But given\nthe current increase in interest\nrate, you\u2019d have a total debt\nof \u00a329,914 instead. That\u2019s\n\u00a3754 of additional debt\nequivalent to one month\u2019s\nworth of London rent, before\nyou\u2019ve even started paying\nyour student loans off.\nThis scenario only describes\na standard bachelor\u2019s degree\nunder these changes. Over\nthe course of four years (or\nsix for medics), with no cap to\nthe level RPI can rise to, and\nparticularly in the immediate\neconomic aftermath of\nBritain\u2019s divorce from the EU,\nstudents could see thousands\nof pounds being added\nonto their loans before they\ngraduate.\nThe Intergenerational\nFoundation is now referring\nto us as the \u2018Packhorse\nGeneration\u2019; saddled with\nbillions of debt that many\nof us will never be able to\npay back in full. Indeed, the\namount of student debt owed\ncurrently stands at around\n\u00a376bn, compared to \u00a334bn\nin 2011 \u2013 with much of this\ndebt now being sold off by\nthe government to private\ncompanies.\nFurther cause for concern is\nthe additional front-loading of\ndebt that will be introduced\nthis coming November. With\ntuition fees now set to rise in\nline with inflation, increasing\nthe maximum amount payable\nto \u00a39,250 starting this year,\nthe level of debt students can\naccrue is increasing, as is the\ninterest they will be expected\nto pay on it.\nDue to this, it can be argued\nthat students pay a double\ninflationary \u2018uplift\u2019 on their\nL\nast Wednesday\nmarked the day of\nthe largest graduation\nceremony at Imperial\nwheremorethan3000\ndoctors, engineers,\nscientist and \u201cfuture business\nleaders\u201d from 93 countries\ngraduated.\nWatched by a record 9400\nguests (which is surprising\nconsideringnoonereallywants\nto watch anyone graduate\ntwice) the ceremonies were\naddressed by President Alice\nGast. \u201cYou have the potential\nto accomplish great things,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cI hope that you\nwill use your intelligence\nand education to solve the\nproblems of today and the\nproblems that will arise in the\nfuture,\u201d she added, making\naudience members wonder\nwhat secrets board members\nof Chevron are privy to.\nDuring the ceremonies,\nan honorary degree was\nstudent achievement\nincluding Paralympic bronze\nmedalist and bioengineering\npostgraduate student, Captain\nDavid Henson, currently\nsitting on the Advisory Board\nof the Imperial Centre for Blast\nInjury Studies as the veterans\u2019\nrepresentative.\nAllthreetwohourceremonies\ntook place at the Royal Albert\nHall, although the highlight of\nPostgrad graduation day was\narguably the full evacuation\nRelieved postgrads finally graduate\nLef Apsotolakis\nof both the Bone and Rod\nHill buildings, opposite the\nBeit Quad, after someone\noperated the manual call\npoint triggering a fire alarm.\nIt is unclear whether the alarm\nwas triggered accidentally or\nas part of a practical joke.\nUnfortunately the evacuation\nwas of little use to graduates\nand their families being bored\nout of their minds across the\nroad.\nRPI % RPI + 3% Total Debt \u00a3\nnow\nYear Total Debt \u00a3 at a 3.9\nconstant interest rate\n0.9 3.9 9,351\n2014 9,351\n1.6 4.6 19,195\n2015 19,066\n3.1 6.1 29,914\n2016 29,160\n\n"

From\nstart, he placed van Aschat\nand Reijn in a theatre venue,\nwhich itself contributes to the\nconstruction of a contemporary non-space.\nThe stage is stark, kept at\nbare minimum; septic, its contours are linear, uninterrupted\napart from some cut geometric volumes and Perspex\nwindowed doors, all softly\nback lit. The visual element\non stage that metaphorically\ncrashes the characters is a\nsinister suspended combustion\nengine that unsettles throughout the play, with its rumbling\nnoise, smoke, and spewing\nof blood-like oil. Aside from\nthis, an automated harmonica\nsupplies part of the music\nand a discrete treadmill that\nemphasises the meaningless\nattempt of the characters\nto escape, but eventually\nrunning nowhere. The whole\nglorious design set is the\nsuccessful result of a long-term collaboration between\nvan Hove and the highly\ntalented Jan Versweyveld and\nit is one of the play\u2019s biggest\nstrengths.\nAlthough there is no\naddition to the stage \u2013 apart\nfrom Reijn trashing the floor\nwith a bin-load while madly\nsinging a French song \u2013 there\nis a dynamic soundscape of\nmusic, rhythmic notes, and\noutdoor Foley of crickets and\ncats, in which the characters\u2019\nfates unfold, as they run\ntowards an inevitable climax\nof death. The rich soundscape\nalso accounts for some issue\nabout the adaptation of\ndialogue: flat and slow, it can\nhamper the conversation\u2019s\npace. But, when everybody is\nsilent, it allows you to appreciate the stylishly perfect\naesthetic of the set as well as\nJude Law's physique du r\u00f4le.\nAs Van Hove\u2019s fourth Visconti production, Obsession\nThere will be\nblood\nAgnese Abrusci\nObsession is on at the Barbican till the\n20th\nof May\nTickets \u00a316\u201360\nJude Law as Gino in a new stage adaptation of Visconti's penetrating social drama directed by Ivo van\nHove // The Barbican\noriginal\u2019s atmosphere of\nsocial misery, so clearly what\nallured the Belgian director\nwas the obsession angle, the\nfixated passion that consumes\nthe two characters, and\nthe impossibility to sustain\nit without leading to their\ndestruction.\nGino is a magnetic and\nfeline drifter played by an\nintense joy-for-the-eyes Jude\nLaw, who wanders into an\nisolated caf\u00e8 and encounters its owner, Joseph (Gijs\nScholten van Aschat), and\nhis much younger, frustrated\nwife Hanna (Halina Reijn).\nFatally attracted, Gino and\nHanna engage in an affair\nwhilst plotting to murder her\nhusband; but the guilt haunts\nGino, and their unbearable\npassion drags them into a\nfatally destructive spiral, in\nperfect line with any Greek\ntragedy.\nThe drama appears more\nsexually charged than in the\noriginal film, and the two lead\nactors go at it with a passion\nthat will ultimately destroy\ntheir idealistic romance. Law\nis muscular, moody, and\nfeatures a company of very\ntalented Dutch and British\nactors, led by Law, who all\ngive convincing, solid acting,\nsupported by a strong visual\nelement that always keeps the\naudience engaged. But when\nthe climax comes \u2013 with its\noverpowering music and its\ncinematic seascapes raising\nfrom the stage floor \u2013 all of\na sudden it derails the viewer\ninto a deep romantic territory,\nlosing the powerful noir texture of the drama. In the end,\nwhile van Hove's version of\nObsession appears well exe-cuted, and will still leave you\nlonging for the Belgian direc-tor's next project, it lacks that\noriginal power of Visconti's\nmovie, where passion arises\nout of a sordid and desolated\nsocial environment.\n\\\\ Gino is a\nmagnetic and feline\ndrifter played by an\nintense joy-for-the-eyes Jude Law \\\\\n\\\\ The stage is\nstark, kept at bare\nminimum; septic,\nits contours are\nlinear, uninterrupted\napart from some cut\ngeometric volumes\nand Perspex\nwindowed doors \\\\\n\\\\ The whole\nglorious design set\nis the successful\nresult of a long-term collaboration\nbetween van\nHove and the\nhighly talented Jan\nVersweyveld and it\nis one of the play\u2019s\nbiggest strengths \\\\\n\n"

You probably don\u2019t\neither. In fact I\u2019d go so far\nas to say that no one likes\nbeing cheated on. Unless\nyou\u2019re into cuckolding but\nthat\u2019s a whole other story.\nLast time I got cheated on\nit made me feel betrayed\nand angry not only at my\npartner, but also at the other\nperson that had participated\nin the backstabbing that is\ncheating. At the same time I\nhave both unknowingly and\nknowingly slept with someone\nwho was in a monogamous\nrelationship, so my being\nangry is hypocritical at best,\nand completely illogical at\nworst. So... is being the \u2018other\nwoman\u2019 ok?\nLet\u2019s try a mental experi-ment. You\u2019re in Metric with\nyour buds. The alcohol is flow-ing, and you\u2019re vibing with\ntake them home. That is until\nsome busybody butts in and\ncoughs out a \u201ctaken\u201d leading\nyou into an existential crisis\ncentered around a single\nquestion: Do you still fuck\nthem?\nA lot of what you do comes\ndown to social obligation,\nand whether it\u2019s a worthwhile\ntrade-off for the hassle and\naggro that it\u2019s gonna incur.\nOr, some might say, a question of morals. But does this\nbit of information \u2013 info that\nyou didn\u2019t ask for and that\nthe person you want to bang\neveryone you\u2019re flirting with\nif they are taken? Or do you\nslip in the question just as you\nrequest the Uber? Is it too late\nto ask when the clothes are\ncoming off? What about just\nbefore you climax? Is it up\nto them to police their own\nbehaviour and make their\nown decisions?\nThese are all valid ques-tions. On the one hand, to\ngive informed consent, you\nneed to be aware of the situation enough to justifiably call\nyourself informed. But is their\nrelationship status a relevant\nwith them or their partner.\nThen you almost contractually\nhave social obligations to\nthem which probably include\nnot screwing with them and\ntheir partner. But if you\u2019re not\nfriends with them, is it any of\nyour business? Why should\nyou go out of your way to\nenforce something for this\nperson who is insignificant\nin your life at the expense\nof your own pleasure; is\nsomeone else\u2019s monogamy\nyours to enforce? If you think\nyou should be preventing\ncheating, where do you draw\nthe line? You\u2019ve established\nus. In our family-value society\ncheating equals failure. Our\nanger is a result of us trying\nto cope with society questioning our value as a partner.\nWere we not enough for\nthem? Did we do something\nwrong? It\u2019s the feelings of\nbetrayal and inadequacy that\nare the kicker, rather than\nlegitimate anger that two\npeople meaninglessly rubbed\ntheir genitals together. I\u2019m\nnot saying you shouldn\u2019t be\nangry \u2013 a deal is a deal. If I\nhad been promised a two for\none lobster dinner and had\nto pay full price at the end of\nmy meal, I\u2019d be pretty fucking\npissed.\nBUT the priority should be\nanger at the person who\nhas betrayed us, rather than\nprojecting betrayal onto\nsomeone who really had no\nvested interest in us. If I can\njustify feeling guiltless when\nI sleep with someone who is\nsupposedly in an exclusive\nrelationship, I should be self-aware enough to recognise\nthat I\u2019m not actually angry at\nsomeone who does the same\nthing.\nIt\u2019s the responsibility of the\npeople in a relationship, and\nno one else, to be respectful\nof their partners, whether that\nmeans being honest or being\nfaithful or paying rent or\nkeeping the toilet seat down.\nIf they\u2019re a cheater, they\u2019re\na cheater, and nothing you\ndo makes a blind bit of difference to their relationship.\nSo now put yourself back in\nMetric with this hottie.

And more\nimportantly, should it?\nRegardless of the complexities of their relationship and\nthe trustworthiness of the\nparty-pooping source, suppose you found out that they\nweren\u2019t single the morning\nafter instead. Should you\nhave known? Should you\nhave asked them and if so\nwhen? Is it necessary to ask\ndetail? Just as you don\u2019t need\nto know their brother\u2019s name\nor the town they grew up in,\nor quite frankly their name,\ndo you really need to know\nthat they\u2019re taking a night off\nfrom going steady with that\nchick they met in the library?\nPolicing the sexual exclusivity of everyone who crosses\nyour path can\u2019t be your\nresponsibility.\nIt\u2019s different if you\u2019re friends\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being the other woman\n\\\\ You\u2019ve\nestablished they\u2019re a\nscumbag: if they\u2019re\nnot fucking you,\nthey\u2019ll be fucking\nsomeone else \\\\\nthey\u2019re a scumbag: if they\u2019re\nnot fucking you, they\u2019ll be\nfucking someone else.

The track features\na catchy flute sample, which\ntrailblazer. It also makes the\nhook to Portland, where we\nhear Quavo sing, \u201cHell nah,\nnever let a nigga ride your\nwave\u201d all the more ironic,\nwhen it could be argued that\nDrake has ridden waves in\nthe past. Even the penultimate track, Ice Melts, sounds\nslightly similar to Broccoli\nby D.R.A.M. (who claimed\nDrake \u201cjacked\u201d his song\nCha Cha for his 2015 hit\nHotline Bling). It raises the\nquestion, when does drawing\ninspiration from something\nsimply become imitation and\nis Drake\u2019s music guilty of\nthe latter? The saying goes\n\u201cimitation is the sincerest form\nof flattery\u201d, but this is not the\ncase in the competitive world\nof hip-hop. I would argue\nthat Drake doesn\u2019t overtly\nride waves, he simply keeps\nin touch with popular trends\nand positions himself in such\na way to ensure his music\nalways remains relevant, a\nnecessary skill and something\nhe does better than any other\nartist.\nOnce I overcame my initial\nhope that, by delivering a\nplaylist instead of an album,\nDrake would treat us to something completely different and\nunexpected, I was able to\nenjoy More Life for what it is:\na stellar, albeit typical Drake\nproject. As he\u2019s done on previous albums, Drake uses the\nfinal track, Do Not Disturb, to\nunload, letting fans hear him\nat his most pensive and vul-nerable. He raps\n\u201cLast verse I\ngotta do is\nalways like surgery / Always\ntryin\u2019 to let go of anything\nthat\u2019ll burden me / That\u2019s the\nreason you can feel the tension and the urgency\u201d before\nproceeding to fire some\nthinly veiled disses at fellow\nToronto rapper Tory Lanez:\n\u201cLast chance I get to make\nsure you take it personally\n/ Take this shit to heart, it\u2019s\nalways executed perfectly /\nIf we do a song it\u2019s like takin\u2019\nmy kids to work with me /\nYou overnight celebrity, you\none day star / Swear I told\nyou that I\u2019m in this bitch for\neternity / I am a reflection of\nall your insecurities / Behind\nclosed doors, a lot of 6 god\nworshipping / Done talk\nnow, \u2018cause there\u2019s other shit\nthat\u2019s concernin\u2019 me\u201d. These\nare Drake\u2019s most direct shots\nat Tory Lanez (whose real\nname is Daystar Peterson\nand whose debut album is\ntitled I Told You) since his\n\u201cNew Toronto\u201d reference\non 2016\u2019s Summer Sixteen.\nThis is typical of Drake in\nthe sense that, throughout\nMore Life, he sticks to familiar\nmaterial, namely pensive\nmusings about his relation-ships, success and his rivals\n(on Gyalchester, he spits \u201cI\nknow I said top five, but I\u2019m\ntop two / And I\u2019m not two\nand I got one / Thought you\nof his career on Sacrifices (as\na Young Thug fan, I\u2019m weirdly\nproud of him for coming from\nmumble rap at its finest to\nactually speaking English \u2013\nor as he calls it \u201cTalkin\u2019 neat\nlike a geek\u201d \u2013 on a verse).\n2 Chainz is also featured on\nthat track and the man simply\nhasn\u2019t missed the mark with a\nfeature in like 6 years. We\u2019re\nnot bored of this Drake formula for success yet but will\nwe soon tire of it? Artists like\nKanye West are constantly\npushing the boundaries by\nregularly reinventing their\nsound and surprising fans\nwith a fresh approach to their\ncraft and I believe that, for\nhis music and artistry to reach\nnew heights, Drake needs to\nartistically challenge himself\nmore.\nAfter countless listens, I\nstill don\u2019t really know the\ndifference between a playlist\nand an album. Perhaps, by\ndubbing it a \u2018playlist\u2019, Drake\nmeant More Life would lack\nthe cohesion or clear theme/\ngenre of an album. Instead,\nhe delivers a real blend\nof genres, with Jamaican,\nLondon and Toronto Drake\nall co-existing in beautiful\nharmony on this project. In\nmany respects, More Life\nsucceeds where his previous\noffering, the solid but somewhat underwhelming Views\nfailed. Although it is 2 tracks\nlonger than Views, More\nLife doesn\u2019t feel excessive\nand better manages to grip\nlisteners from beginning to\nend. Despite the fact One\nDance is an absolute tune, it\n\\\\ I can\u2019t tell if\nDrake\u2019s recent\ninfatuation with\nLondon is genuine\nlove or all just a\nmarketing ploy \\\\\nseems to be the key to\nmaking a hit hip-hop record\nthese days (Future\u2019s Mask\nOff, 21 Savage\u2019s X and\nKodak Black\u2019s Tunnel Vision\nall feature flutes in their\nproduction) \u2013 the flute is just\nhot right now. Quavo and\nTravis together on a track is\nalso a recipe for success \u2013\nthe duo simply does not miss.\nQuavo + Travis + flute = fire!\nThe track\u2019s title is seemingly\na reference to the Portland\nTrail Blazers basketball\nteam, suggesting that Drake,\nQuavo and Travis consider\nthemselves trailblazers in hiphop culture. However, with all\nthe controversy surrounding\nMore Life and many pointing\nout that Drake\u2019s flow on KMT\nsounds suspiciously similar to\nupcoming rapper XXXtentacion\u2019s on his single Look At\nMe, it is ironic that\nDrake calls\nhimself a\n\\\\ He delivers a real\nblend of genres,\nwith Jamaican,\nLondon and Toronto\nDrake all co-existing\nin beautiful harmony\non this project \\\\\nhad one, but it\u2019s not one,\nnigga, nah\u201d, reminding us\nof his success and further\nasserting his superiority over\nhis rivals in the genre). For\nalmost a decade, Drake has\nbeen rapping about what it\u2019s\nlike to be Drake, taking us\nthrough the ups and downs of\nlife as the 6 God and we\u2019re\nstill all ears. Drake is just that\nguy. It\u2019s the reason I cringe\nwhenever he does his London\naccent yet I still listen to every\ntrack he drops. He even\nmanaged to get Young Thug\nto spit the most eloquent verse\n\\\\ Paper Soho\nDrake previewing new songs in February \\\\ Paper Soho\n\\\\ I believe that,\nfor his music and\nartistry to reach\nnew heights, Drake\nneeds to artistically\nchallenge himself\nmore \\\\\ncould be argued that it lacked\noriginality and was simply a\nrehashing of Kyla\u2019s 2008 UK\nFunky house anthem, Do You\nMind. In contrast, on More\nLife, Drake better tows the fine\nline between appreciation\nand appropriation, ultimately\nsucceeding in paying homage\nto his numerous musical\ninfluences. Since his magnum\nopus, 2011\u2019s Take Care, I\u2019ve\nbeen waiting for Drake to produce a cohesive body of work\nwhich matches its quality and\nsubsequently has a similar\nseismic impact on the culture.\nHe previously came close\nwith 2015\u2019s If You\u2019re Reading\nThis It\u2019s Too Late and, in my\nopinion, More Life also comes\nvery close and deserves a\nseat up there with some of\nthe best work of his stellar\ndiscography.\n\n"

The invite only \u2018secret\u2019\nclubs have been accused of\nsexism, discrimination, and\nelitism among other things in\nthe past and the Union has time\nand time again reiterated it is\nnot in any way affiliated with\nthem. The paper, proposed\nby Andrew Olson, attempted\nto limit tankard use by Tie\nClubs by enforcing the Equal\nOpportunities Policy.\nOlson argued that according\nto the policy, the Union should\n\u201ctry and foster an environment\nfree of unfair discrimination\nand harassment\u201d and that any\nclub which fails to comply with\nthis policy as a consequence\nshouldn\u2019t have access to\nUnion resources. He argued\nthat merely the invitation only\nmechanism in which the clubs\noperate should exclude them\nfrom using Union resources.\nThe paper is an attempt to\ntackle concerns of a culture of\ndiscrimination thought to be\nprevalent within these clubs.\nIt did however cause many\nTie Club members to view it\nas a witch-hunt and request\nboth anonymous voting and\namendments that would\nremove references of the Tie\nClubs (namely the 22 Club,\nthe Chaps Club and the Links\nClub from the paper). After a\nvote it was decided that voting\nwould not be anonymous\nAs soon as the paper was\nput to discussion, protests\nstarted pouring in from the\nfloor, which saw a higher\nnumber of students that usual,\npresumably Tie Club members\nand students that had come to\nshow support for the paper.\nAlmost immediately, ICU\nPresident Nas Andriopoulos\nprotested allegations that his\ninvolvement with the Tie Clubs\ncould interfere with carrying\nout his role. \u201cI have no problem\nseparating my professional to\npersonal life and I found any\ninsinuations in the paper and\non Facebook groups that I\ncouldn\u2019t quite unimpressive,\u201d\nhe said. Contrary to his\nopening statement he\nproceeded to argue almost\nevery point raised by Olson.\nHe also voted against Note\nThree which put on record that\nconcerns have been raised\nsurrounding \u201ccertain alumni\ngroups\u201d (referring to the Tie\nClubs) and Resolution Two\nwhich basically would amend\nthe Tankard Policy in order\nto ban groups that violate\nthe Safe Space Policy (again\nreferring to the Tie Clubs) from\nusing tankards.\nEllie Winstanley current\nACC Chair and XV\u2019s club\npresident as well as several\nother Tie Club members and\nrepresentatives also took to\nthe floor to protest certain\npoints. Winstanley claimed\ncertain club leaders had been\ntrying to \u201cmodernise\u201d certain\nclubs to make them \u201cmore\nprogressive\u201d and maintained\nthat the XV\u2019s were in fact\na sister group to the 22s.\nRegarding the XV\u2019s she said\n\u201cWe do not discriminate based\non gender and on race and I\nfeel like not acknowledging\nthe progress that we\u2019ve\nmade is in fact hindering it.\u201d\nThough this change might be\nhappening it should be noted\nthat the Links for example only\nhave one female member who\nis currently a student.\nJames Cox Deputy President\nfor Clubs and Societies and\na Tie Club member also\ntook to the floor to defend\nthe organisations. Cox\nclaimed there\u2019s been a lot of\nmisinformation surrounding\nwhat these \u201cpublic facing,\nself organising alumni\nassociations\u201d do and do not\nget up to and proclaimed\nhis disappointment in the\nmarginalisation of Tie Club\nmembers to several audience\nmembers\u2019 amusement.\n\u201cThe motion today ignores\nthe efforts of recent years to\nallow anyone who wants to\ncome along and wants to get\nto know the club members to\nbe part of one. The clubs don\u2019t\nwant people to feel like they\ncan\u2019t come along if they want\nto even if that\u2019s not coming\nacross. These are students\nfacing the same financial,\nphysical and mental health\nissues as everyone else, not\nprivileged private-schooled\nboys as people might believe.\nI can\u2019t personally seem to get\nmy head around as to why\ngroups renowned for the\npromotion of free expression\nhave rallied in support of a\npaper that marginalises a\nsmall minority of students and\nhow they spend their free\ntime.\u201d\nSeveral students also showed\nup to push for measures\nagainst Tie Clubs. Notably\nFintan O\u2019Connor, newly\nelected Deputy President for\nWelfare was unforgiving.\n\u201cThis paper is not out to smear\nTie Clubs or to smear their\nmembers\u201d, O\u2019Connor said\nadding that it was an effort to\ncreate an inclusive and open\ncommunity and concluding\nthat \u201cit\u2019s inconsistent with our\nbeliefs to continue to support\na relic of institutionalised\nprivilege [referring to the\ninvitation only policy] even in\nsuch ways as tankard storage\nand that is why I\u2019m supporting\nthis paper.\u201d\nWhen pressed for details\non the process behind the\ninvite only mechanism Tie\nClub members said it\u2019s about\n\u201cmeeting\u201d and \u201cinteracting\u201d,\nwhatever that means.\nAfter a lengthy discussion\nof amendments, the paper\npassed with a majority\nvote. Notable votes against\nseveral notes, beliefs and\nresolutions predictably came\nfrom Andriopoulos, Cox,\nand Winstanley but also\nfrom RSMU President Noah\nHawkings and ICSMSU\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nClaudia Caravello. The full\nbreakdown can be found\nonline.\nAlex Adler a postgraduate\nCouncil members was satisfied\nwith the result. \u201cI\u2019m glad\nthe paper passed despite\nthe amendments which I\nfeel slightly weakened the\nsentiment. I\u2019m happy to see\nthat a subject could raise such\nvigorous debate in Council,\nalthough I would rather see\nit also happen with issues\nmore relevant to the student\nexperience, like tuition,\nbursaries and racism.\u201d\nThe Union spearheaded\nby Deputy President Finance\nand Services, Rachel Blythe is\nexpected to soon start dealing\nwith the Tie Club tankards.\n\\\\ Merely the\ninvitation only\nmechanism in which\nthe clubs operate\nshould exclude them\nfrom using Union\nresources \\\\\n\\\\ James Cox\nproclaimed his\ndisappointment in\nthe marginalisation\nof Tie Club\nmembers to several\naudience members\u2019\namusement \\\\\n\\\\ When pressed\nfor details on the\nprocess behind\nthe invite only\nmechanism Tie Club\nmembers said it\u2019s\nabout \u201cmeeting\u201d\nand \u201cinteracting\u201d,\nwhatever that\nmeans \\\\\nA&E Chair Rob Garside literally eating popcorn at Council \\\\ felix\n\n"
