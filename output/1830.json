Full stop.\u2019\n\u2018I will ensure we take swift action against it wherever\nand whenever we see it,\u2019 wrote Brady in a private letter to\nthe two societies on Tuesday morning.\nJewish Society and Israeli Society expressed gratitude\ntowards the fact that Brady had written back to them.\n\u2018Imperial\u2019s response has been improving over time,\u2019 said\na representative of Jewish Society, speaking to Felix after\nseeing Brady\u2019s letter. \u2018But the bar was very low to start\nwith.\u2019\nBrady reassured Jewish and Israeli students that \u2018Your\nsafety as part of Imperial\u2019s community is of paramount\nimportance for me and our wider leadership team.\u2019 He\nurged them to \u2018report hate speech, harassment or abuse\nto university management, or via our Report and Support tool.\u2019\n\u2018We will have to see how things change moving forward,\u2019 said the Jewish Society representative. They\npointed out that all of the support measures mentioned\nin Brady\u2019s letter already existed, but that students feared\nreporting antisemitism for fear of being identified. \u2018Imperial has already banned hate speech, but still these issues continue.\u2019\nThe representative called on the College to describe\nHamas as a terrorist group in communications to the\nwider student body \u2013 something it has yet to do. \u201cHamas\nis a designated terrorist group. Supporting them is ille-gal, and inciting any violent antisemitism is illegal. Several students and staff do need to be reminded of this.\u201d\nThe original open letter describes the experience of\nJewish students on campus. \u2018Even in relatively peaceful\ntime,\u2019 it says, \u2018Imperial Jewish and Israeli students feel\nfear on campus. They are scared to be openly Jewish and\nopenly Israeli for fear of classmates and lecturers attacking them. They fear verbal repercussions, online har-assment, discrimination, isolation and bullying. These\nfears are well founded, many students have reported antisemitism and racism on campus.\u2019\nSome Jewish students have described incidents in\nwhich they have received insensitive comments from\ntheir personal tutors. Felix is not sharing the details of\nthese incidents in order to protect the identities of the\nstudents involved.\nOthers say that they feel unable to approach their tu-tors, pointing to their friends\u2019 experiences and their tutors\u2019 comments on public forums.\nJewish Society says that students feel isolated; since\nthere are so few Jewish students at Imperial, they fear\nthere will be no one to protect them if they are subject to\nantisemitic comments.\nImperial\u2019s changing rhetoric\nBrady\u2019s response is the most recent in a series of communications Imperial has sent on the war and the Hamas attack.\nThe first few of these drew criticism from Jewish and\nIsraelistudents.AtweetsentfromImperial\u2019sX(formerly\nTwitter) account on 10th\nOctober, said that its \u2018thoughts\nare with all those affected by the escalating violence in\nIsrael and Gaza.\u2019\nThe next day, Provost Ian Walmsley sent a letter to Imperial\u2019s Jewish and Israeli societies, stating that \u2018Our Imperial community stands as one against acts of violence\nand hatred,\u2019 and expressing his shock at the \u2018appalling\nviolence in Israel and Gaza\u2019.\nOn the afternoon of Friday 13th\n, Jewish and Israeli Society sent an open letter to the College, at the same time\nas a series of other letters from staff, students and alum-ni.\n\u2019We do not understand\u2026 why Imperial hasn\u2019t condemned [Hamas\u2019s] heinous acts,\u2019 they wrote, expressing dismay that Imperial had made no mention of the\nproscribed terrorist group. \u2018We feel shocked that these\natrocities have been so heavily downplayed.\u2019\nReferring to the College\u2019s response thus far, they said:\n\u2018Vague, non-commitment that could have been written\nby ChatGPT is an affront to our dignity\u2019.\nThe letter ended with a call for the College to meet\nwith Jewish and Israeli students to discuss how best it\ncould support them.\nHours after the open letter was published, Imperial\nPresident Hugh Brady sent a statement to all College\nmembers, saying, \u2018This week\u2019s terrible attacks by Hamas against Israel and the escalation of violence in Gaza\nhave been truly shocking.\u2019\nWhat happened in Israel and Gaza?\nThis section contains details some readers may find distressing.\nIn the early hours of Saturday 7th\nOctober, Hamas, the\nproscribed terrorist group governing the Gaza strip,\nlaunched a surprise attack on Israel. Thousands of\nrockets were fired, and Hamas militants breached the\nGaza-Irael barrier, massacring at least 1,400 civilians\nand soldiers, and taking hundreds hostage. Videos posted by Hamas on social media show that Israeli victims\nwere set alight, dismembered, beheaded, and raped.\nIsrael retaliated swiftly, pounding the Gaza strip with\nits own airstrikes. As of 15th\nOctober, Israel\u2019s strikes are\nestimated to have killed at least 2,670 people, and injured thousands more. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been forced to evacuate northern Gaza, and\nIsrael has imposed a total blockade on the strip, preventing the entry of food, water, electricity, and water. These\ndevelopments have exacerbated the existing humanitarian crisis in the region. Nearly half of the 1.3 million\nresidents of Gaza are children.\nUN human rights experts have condemned Hamas\u2019s\n\u2018deliberate and widespread killing of innocent civilians\u2019\nand Israel\u2019s \u2018indiscriminate military attacks against the\nalready exhausted Palestinian people of Gaza\u2019. They described the actions of both sides as war crimes.\nHughBradyrespondsto\nopenletterfromJewish\nandIsraelisocieties\nThe letter had slated\nImperial\u2019s \u2018ChatGPT\u2019like response to the\nHamas attack.\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nNEWS\n\n"

The\ncomposer, Ros Gilman, is a worthy challenger to this task. Having studied violin\nperformance, composition, and conducting at both the University of Music, Vienna and the Royal School of Music, Ros has\naccumulated a plethora of qualifications\nand repertoire, having worked alongside\nshort-film director Anna-Ester Volozh, as\nwell as working on the HBO series Folklore and programmes for various channels in Germany and France.\nRecently Ros has worked with Volozh\non The Last Cloudweaver, an animated\nshort film about an ancient dragon who\nbestows the knowledge of \u2018cloudweaving\u2019 to his young apprentice. For his work\non this film, Ros was nominated for a\nSeptimus Award as well as, most recently,\nreceived accolades at the London Music+Sounds Awards.\nA few weeks ago, I had the pleasure to\nspeak with Ros himself, not only about\nhis award nominations, but also on his\nlife as a young composer, his recent work,\nand his transition to orchestral composi-tion, as well as looking at his influences\nand methodology.\nGJ - Having read your biography, I was\nhoping to hear, in your own words, your\njourney from being a\nmusician all the way to being a film\ncomposer?\nRG \u2013 My journey started very early on;\nboth my parents were professional musicians and when I was three years old, I\nstarted my journey as a violinist. I went\non to study concert violin at in Vienna\nbut, unfortunately, I suffered a hand injury which put it all on hold. For me it was\nthen a question of \u2018what do I do?\u2019 I\u2019ve always loved films, and have always loved\nmusic, it made sense to combine those\ntwo loves. That was how I ended up going back to university to study to be a film\ncomposer.\nGJ \u2013 Do you think writing music for\nfilms and TV comes with its challenges?\nRG \u2013 Absolutely. There\u2019s sort of an upside and a downside here. The structure\nof the music is already predetermined, I\nfeel that my job as a composer is to reinforce the emotion of the story presented\nto you. The challenge is that you\u2019re not\nfree to write whatever you like, but also\nyou must follow the director\u2019s vision;\nthey have an idea of what they want to\nachieve in a scene, the challenge is to find\nout what they\u2019re after.\nGJ\u2013Inthiscase,howdidyoufindworking with Anna on The Last Cloudweaver\nand working for the first time with a full-scale orchestra.\nRG \u2013 It was wonderful! Anna and I\nhad worked on one occasion before with\na smaller orchestra on a project called\nJohanne. She approached me with The\nLast Cloudweaver and I immediately said\n\u2018absolutely!\u2019 It was ambitious for a short\nfilm, but Anna kindly gave us such a\nlarge music budget with which to work.\nOftentimes, Anna guided me in a direction I wouldn\u2019t have always gone but it\nworked out well and working with this\nlarge lineup was a welcome moment.\nGJ \u2013 I notice that you worked on a lot\nof electronic music in your early career.\nWhat was it like being able to take the\nreins of a full-scale orchestra this time?\nRG-Itwaswonderful.Itwasbothhumbling and wonderful being with these\nprofessional musicians. You know, with\nolder and wiser musicians they might be\nthinking \u2018who is this young guy?\u2019 but it\nturned out to be a great experience.\nGJ \u2013 This film lacks any dialogue, so\nyou use motifs throughout to represent\neach character. How did you come up\nwith these melodies and harmonies for\neach character and scene?\nRG \u2013 As you say, there\u2019s no dialogue, so\nit was great being able to assign themes\nand particular instruments to each char-acter. The story features a dragon and a\nyoung girl, the dragon is very grand and\nold and so I used a solemn theme played\non the cello; the girl is more impatient\nand younger and so she was represented\nby a piccolo playing a nostalgic but playful theme.\nGJ \u2013 You mentioned nostalgia, I heard\nyou using the pentatonic scale throughout and I wondered if you used these\nmore ancient modes to emphasise that\ntheme?\nRG\u2013 I think there is that reason behind\nit, but one reason was because the director loves Japanese animation, and you get\na lot of these harmonies and melodies in\nJapanese music, particularly the music of\nStudio Ghibli by Joe Hisaishi.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n6 | NEWS 20 october 2023\nA\nmerican oil giant ExxonMobil has\npulled out of a careers talk hosted\nby Physics Society, Imperial\u2019s departmental society for Physics students.\n\u2018Due to concerns from climate activists\nand students in our community, ExxonMobil [sic] have made the decision to pull\nout of this event,\u2019 reads an email from\nHenry Leitch, the Physics Society President. \u2018We\u2019re very proud of our community for raising their concerns to us and\nhope they feel heard.\u2019\nLeitch writes that PhySoc was not paid\nfor the event, and that it was \u2018purely a careers opportunity for students to show\ninterest in... PhySoc is not sponsored by\nany oil companies.\u2019\n\u2018However,\u2019 he continues, \u2018many graduates do work in this field, and it is likely\nmany will in the coming year.\u2019\nHow it happened\nTalking to Felix, Leith outlined the sequence of events that led to the careers\ntalk, and then its subsequent cancella-tion.\nAn Imperial graduate who worked\nfor Exxon\u2019s Global Trading group approached Physics Society with a proposal for the company to host a careers talk.\nThere was no monetary incentive, says\nLeith.\nThe graduate told Leith that the Global\nTrading group had taken on eight Imperial students in the previous year. \u201cThey\ntold me they were looking to expand the\ngroup, and they were saying, \u2018We\u2019ll reach\nout to universities and do the standard\nprocedure of offering graduate jobs to\npull in students.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSo I go, \u2018Cool.\u2019 I share many of the\nsympathies which many other people\ndo, but my personal views on Exxon were\nnot important. The equation for me was\nthat some people are taking these jobs,\nand restricting that would be almost as\ncontroversial as not restricting it. My job\nis to provide these opportunities.\u201d\nSo, Leith and the Physics Society committee planned and advertised the event.\nThe backlash was swift, he says. \u201cIt all\nhappened over the course of a day \u2013 or\neven less.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doing lectures and then I\u2019m coming out and I\u2019m talking to friends about it\nand then I\u2019m going into lectures and then\nnext they\u2019ve pulled out. We were getting\nmessages left, right, and centre.\u201d\nLeith is reluctant to name the individuals and groups that contacted him,\nbut says the society received \u201cpassionate\nmessages\u201d, and that the complaints were\n\u201creasonably widespread\u201d, coming from\nstudents and other activist groups.\n\u201cI immediately told the Exxon people\nwhat was happening, and they decided\nto pull out for security reasons\u201d, he con-tinues. \u201cThey said that they weren\u2019t able\nto send someone in with enough security\nprovision to be able to run the event safe-ly, because it was too close to the date of\nthe event.\u201d\nHe admits he was na\u00efve in assuming\neverything would proceed smoothly.\n\u201cThis has been a learning curve for me.\nIn handover documents [for next year\u2019s\nPhysics Society committee], I\u2019m going to\ndoubly stress that these things are risky,\nbecause this was quite a scary experience\u201d\nHowever, the Physics Society committee still feels there is value in holding\nevents like this, rather than cancelling\nthem altogether. \u201cIf we ran this event,\nthen people who care could ask constructive questions and create debates around\nit. The idea of shutting down discussion\nis something we were against.\u201d\n\u201cIs it the choice of the individual, or is\nImperial\u2019s job to restrict student access\nto these companies as part of a wider\nagenda to make the world a better place?\nThat\u2019s not for me to answer.\u201d\nExxonMobil highlighted its \u201clongstanding\u201d relationship with Imperial,\nsaying, \u201cMany Imperial alumni have\nbuilt long and highly successful careers\nwith ExxonMobil. \u201cToday,\u201d it said, \u201cOur\nfocus is on delivering the critical energy\nand essential products the world needs\nwhile at the same time reducing emissions to accelerate the world\u2019s path to a\nnet zero future.\u201d\nExxonMobil and climate\nscience\nExxonMobil has been criticised for its\nstance on climate change. A study published last year in Science, a peer-re-viewed academic journal, found that between 1977 and 2003, Exxon\u2019s scientists\nhad \u2018predicted global warming correctly\nand skilfully\u2019. \u2018Yet,\u2019 it alleged, \u2018Whereas\nacademics and government scientists\nworked to communicate what they knew\nto the public, ExxonMobil worked to\ndeny it.\u2019\nAt Exxon\u2019s 2013 annual shareholder\nmeeting, Rex Tillerson, then CEO, said\nincorrectly: \u201cIf you examine the temperature record of the last decade, it [hasn\u2019t]\nreally changed.\u2019\n\u2018What if [after] everything we do, it\nturns out our models are lousy, and we\ndon\u2019t get the effects we predict?\u201d\nBetween 1989 and 2010, Exxon published regular \u2018advertorials\u2019 in major\nAmerican newspapers, with titles such\nas \u2018Unsettled Science\u2019 (\u2018it is impossible\nfor scientists to attribute the recent small\nsurface temperature increase to human\nactivity.\u2019)\nThe company has also been accused of\ndonating millions to lobby groups that\nsought to deny climate change \u2013 claims\nit denies.\nLast week, ExxonMobil agreed to buy\nshale group Pioneer Natural Resources\nfor $60 billion, betting on the continued\nimportance of oil and gas in the world\u2019s\nenergy supplies. The move came just a\nmonth after the International Energy\nAgency said that demand for oil, natural\ngas, and coal will peak before 2030.\nExxonMobil said it believed it was\n\u201cuniquely well positioned to help society\nachieve its net zero ambition.\u201d\n\u201cWe recognise that climate change is\nreal and that is why we have launched an\nentire business dedicated to helping lower emissions.\u201d\n\u201cOur Low Climate Solutions business\nis working on major carbon capture and\nstorage (CCS), hydrogen and biofuels\nprojects to help lower emissions in vital,\nbut hard to decarbonise sectors, such as\ntransport and heavy industry. And we\nare drawing upon our experience, competencies and competitive advantages\nto develop new solutions to help address\nthe net-zero challenge.\u201d\n\u201cWe encourage everyone at Imperial\nwith an interest in a career in energy to\nfind out more in the \u2018Our Approach\u2019 and\n\u2018Careers\u2019 sections of our website.\u201d\nExxonMobilpulls\noutofPhysSoc\ntalkafterstudent\nopposition\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nNewsWriter\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\n\n"

So much so\nthat it has arguably lost its grav-itas. How many of us actually\nunderstand the term when we\nread it? What does it mean to\ngoverning bodies and corporations that have set net-zero targets for themselves?\nFrom an informal survey of\n43 people (family, friends, and\nacquaintances), I found that\nmost could hit the mark on a\nsimple definition of net zero:\n\u2018emissions produced by humans\nequals emissions absorbed from\nthe atmosphere by humans\u2019.\n\u2018Carbon\u2019 and \u2018greenhouse gas\u2019\n(GHG) emissions were used in-terchangeably, some respondents mentioned economic im-plications, and others expressed\nstrong views about the term.\nMany expressed uncertainty\nin their ability to define it. And\nsome defined it entirely outside\nthe context of climate change by\nsimply stating its mathematical\nmeaning.\nThe UN\u2019s definition is that\n\u2018net zero means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close\nto zero as possible, with any remaining emissions re-absorbed\nfrom the atmosphere, by oceans\nand forests for instance.\u2019 The\nWorld Resource Institute (WRI)\ndefines net zero targets as being\nachieved \u2018when all emissions released by human activities are\ncounterbalanced by removing\ncarbon from the atmosphere in\na process known as carbon removal\u2019. BBC Bitesize (targeted\nat young people) describes net\nzero as \u2018the point at which the\nnumber of greenhouse gases being put out into the atmosphere\nis equal to the number that are\nbeing taken in.\u2019\nThere are a number of key issues in the definition of net zero\nand, more importantly, in the\nconcept itself.\nFirstly, net zero, referring to\nnet-zero GHG emissions tar-gets, is a term that gets thrown\naround a lot by news outlets, in\ngovernment press releases,\nand in companies\u2019 social\ngovernance and responsibility reports. Often,\nthese terms are\nused without\nany kind of\nexplanation\nor justification and\ncould easily\nbe taken out\nof context and\nmisinterpreted by read-ers, as reflected in some\nresponses to my survey.\nEven using the word carbon to qualify emissions\nentails something different\nto greenhouse gases.\nHow can people feel empowered to vote on governments\u2019 climate agendas without being fully informed and\nknowing what terms like net\nzero actually mean? The way\npolicy proposals are worded\ncan influence the public and\nprivate sector\u2019s receptiveness to government inter-vention. Technical literacy\nshould not be taken as a given,\nand thus reporting should take\ngovernment policies and announcements and help make\nthem accessible to all readers of\nvoting age. If policies are proposed in terms that don\u2019t make\nsense to everyone, this excludes\nvoters who feel they don\u2019t understand enough to show their\nsupport or opposition, and invites decisions to be made by\nmisinformed voters.\nBoth in the UK and beyond,\nenvironmental targets have\nbeen shifted significantly over\nthe years. The 20 Aichi biodiversity targets, which were set\nin 2010, expired in 2020 with\nnone being met at a global level.\nThe 2015 Paris\nAgreement on global warming\nis now revisited every year at the\nConference of Parties (COP) on\nclimate change to hold nations\naccountable to their commit-ments. But it also allows them\nto adjust their individual and\ncollective climate goals.\nThe UK\u2019s rolling back\nof its net-zero targets\nencompasses delayed\ninitiation of bans on\nthe sale of new oil-and gas-boilers\nand petrol and\ndiesel cars, as\nwell as announcing they would\nnot be implementing new\ntaxes on flying\nor eating meat.\nThese targets,\nwhich contribute\nto the government\u2019s overarching\nclimate commit-ments, have been shifted\nto later dates with no real\nevidence or sound reason-ing. I for one don\u2019t see the\nissue with maintaining a solid goal when they won\u2019t even\nnecessarily be met at the end of\nthe day. What is the point\nof even setting targets\nif they can so easily be\nadjusted to suit a different agenda?\nOne failure of net\nzero is inherent \u2013 the\nidea of being able to offset one\u2019s GHG emissions. The\nundertone of this tends to be \u2018we\ncan emit as much as we want as\nlong as we find a way to absorb\nthe same amount of emissions\nin return\u2019. Corporations usually\nimplement this through carbon\ncapture and storage (CCS) methods such as forestation and direct air capture (DAC), as well as\nindirect methods like improving production efficiency or\nhabitat restoration.\nGHG offsetting can, however,\nbe harmful. An example of the\npotential damage it can cause\nis the planting of monocultural\ntree plantations that adequately\nperform carbon sequestration\nbut don\u2019t regenerate ecosystems and promote biodiversity.\nOffsetting practices often don\u2019t\ndirectly address other environmental problems that humans\ncause: biodiversity loss, food\nwaste, toxic chemical waste and\npollutions (air, ocean and land),\noverexploitation of natural re-sources, and ecosystem degra-dation.\nOur personal impressions of\nnet zero can be very different to\nwhat corporations and governments are actually working to-wards, and it is difficult to hold\nthem accountable. A net zero\ntracker at zerotracker.net compiles data on net-zero commitments from the largest global\ncorporations and whether they\nreport on their progress, which\nallows consumers to easily find\nthis information (if they choose\nto look for it) and shows how\nlacking some of these major\ncompanies\u2019 climate commitments still are.\nAs much as it appears that\nthe concept of net zero has been\ncorrupted, my intention is by\nno means to criticise net zero\nalone, but to encourage readers\nto think about environmental\nreporting in general. What other terms can you think of that\nare unclear or overly technical?\nThe two biggest topics in environmental activism at the mo-ment, biodiversity and climate\nchange, have endless nuances\nand assumptions attached to\nthem and can be used just as ambiguously as the term net zero.\nThe ability to question language\nand to be aware of its limitations\nare vital for understanding why\nwe aren\u2019t in the position to enact\ndirect change and to better put\npressure on the people who can\nactually make a difference.\nequals emissions absorbed from\nthe atmosphere by humans\u2019.\n\u2018Carbon\u2019 and \u2018greenhouse gas\u2019\n(GHG) emissions were used in-terchangeably, some respondents mentioned economic im-plications, and others expressed\nstrong views about the term.\nMany expressed uncertainty\nin their ability to define it.

The Nobel\nPrize in Chemistry 2023 was awarded to\nAlexei Ekimov, Louis Brus, and Moungi\nBawendi for their groundbreaking work\non quantum dots.\nShrinking science\nDue to quantum confinement, quantum\ndots are not simply nanoscale versions\nof macro-sized semiconductors.\nGenerally, in bulk materials, such as bulk\nsemiconductors, electrons are free\nto move. However within quantum\nconfinement, the laws of classical\nmechanics governing these electrons are\ntossedasidewhenelectronsaretrappedin\na small space like a quantum dot, and the\nmaterial properties begin to be governed\nby quantum mechanics instead. The\nenergy levels accessible to the electrons\nin a quantum dot now become discrete,\nrather than the continuous energy\nband structure that we expect from\nbulk materials. Interestingly, the gap\nbetween these quantised energy levels\nis inversely proportional to the size of\nthe nanomaterial - as the quantum dot\nis made smaller, the energy gap becomes\nlarger. The most intriguing part of this\ndiscovery is that despite being made of\nthe exact same material, quantum dots\ncan be tuned to emit different colours of\nlight, only by changing their size.\nFor a clearer perspective on just how\nsmall these are, a typical quantum dot\nfallsintherangeoftwototennanometres\nacross. By comparison, a human hair\nhas a diameter of 50 micrometres,\n10,000 times larger! Although some\ntheoretical scientists made predictions\nfor the behaviour of such materials,\nthe almost incomprehensible scale\ndifference used to present a barrier to\nsynthesising them and obtaining real\nexperimental evidence. The 2023 Nobel\nLaureates in Chemistry overcame these\nchallenges, redefining the landscape\nof nanochemistry and its potential\napplications.\nIntroducing the laureates\nAlexei Ekimov and Louis Brus both\nfollowedindependentanddifferentpaths\nto the discovery of quantum dots. Seven\nyears after obtaining his PhD, Ekimov\npublished a paper in 1981 in which he\nobserved that the size of copper chloride\ncrystals within a glass matrix, controlled\nby temperature, influenced the final\ncolour of the glass. This discovery is\nrecognised as the first synthesis of\nquantum dots, which Ekimov referred\nto as \u201cthree-dimensional microscopic\nsemiconductor crystals\u201d.\nQuantum dots entered Louis Brus\u2019\njourney as an academic by a stroke of\nserendipity in 1983. While researching\nsemiconductors in solution, Brus noticed\nthat day-old solutions containing\ncadmium sulfide nanoparticles displayed\na different colour to freshly prepared\nsolutions.Throughtransmissionelectron\nmicroscopy, he determined that this\nresulted from the nanoparticles forming\nlarger clusters over time, demonstrating\nquantum size effects in solution.\nMoungi Bawendi enters the scene\nslightly later. His research at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nfrom 1990 onwards streamlined the\nsynthesis and improved precision in\ncreating quantum dots of a specific size,\nboth of which were vital in improving\ntheir commercial applicability.\nMicroscopic scale,\nmacroscopic changes\nAlthough quantum dots are small in\nstature, their applications and potential\nspan all disciplines of science. This\nincludes acting as biosensors in disease\ndiagnosis and monitoring, increasing\nthe wavelengths of light harvestable by\nsolar cells, and raising image quality\nof electric screens. Their versatility\nextends much further. A basic search of\n\u201cquantum dots\u201d into a scientific database\ngenerates 140,000 results, emphasising\nthe groundbreaking efforts by Ekimov,\nBrus and Bawendi. Their contributions,\nrecognised by the Nobel Prize, will leave\nmore than a nano-sized footprint on the\nfuture of science and technology.\nSCIENCE\nNobel\u2019s nanochemists\nand the legacy of\nquantum dots\nScienceWriter\nEMILY WENTWORTH\nQuantum dots with vivid colours stretching from violet to deep red.

Equinor\nwill be operating the recently approved Rosebank oil\nfieldintheNorthSea.InJune,Shelltoldinvestorsitplans\nto expand its natural gas operations. BP plans to expand\nfossil fuel operations in the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico,\nIndonesia and more. This is despite the International\nEnergy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change stating that no new fossil fuel projects\nare compatible with reaching net zero carbon emissions\nby 2050.\nImperial and the Science Museum\nImperial College and the Science Museum have a\nrelationship stronger than just being neighbours. As\nwell as co-hosting the Great Exhibition Road Festival\nwith other institutions, Imperial\u2019s Business School\nheld their Welcome Day at the Science Museum\nearlier this year. Furthermore, PhD students from\nImperial\u2019s Grantham Institute provided evidence for\nthe Shell-sponsored Atmosphere exhibition. Most\nimportantly, three Imperial academics sit on the Science\nMuseum\u2019s Advisory Board. Two of them are Professor\nWashington Yotto Ochieng, EBS, FREng from the\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering,\nand Dr Mark Richards from the Department of Physics.\nFelix asked these academics what they thought about\nfossil fuel sponsorships.\nDr Richards \u2013 a researcher on air pollution who\nlectured on environmental technology \u2013 explained\nto Felix how aware he is of the need to reduce carbon\nemissions. He believes that every climate solution has\nits nuances, and an underrated solution is reducing\nglobal energy demand. Dr Richards emphasised the\nimportance of an inclusive, holistic energy transition \u2013\nwhere no industry or community is left out of climate\ndiscussions, and socioeconomic issues are tackled\nalongside environmental issues. To him, this means\nscience institutions need to work with industries that\nsome people no longer desire but are best placed to\nprovide clean energy for everyone. When asked about\nthe Science Museum\u2019s sponsorships, Dr Richards said\nhe knows that the museum has relationships with fossil\nfuel companies but is unaware of the details of any\ncontracts. He accepted his Advisory Board position to\nencourage the Science Museum Group to make positive\nchanges that benefit all.\nProfessor Ochieng also enjoys the societal impact of\nhisAdvisoryBoardposition.HetoldFelixthattheScience\nMuseum has the advantage of convening industry,\nworld-leading scientists, and the public so the world can\nreach net zero carbon emissions faster. In particular, he\nacknowledged that industry funding allows scientists to\nsharetheirresearchonclimatesolutionswiththepublic.\nProfessor Ochieng explained how very concerned he\nis about the climate crisis, and how he wants fossil\nfuels to be phased out as quickly as possible without\ncompromising energy demand. While he recognises the\nneed for climate solutions to be profitable to industry,\nhe campaigns against environmentally damaging\npolicies. Since Imperial and the Science Museum are\nattractive public educational institutions, Professor\nOchieng believes they should hold energy companies\naccountablefortheiremissionsandhelpacceleratetheir\njourney to net zero. For example, the Science Museum\nGroup\u2019s \u201cpartnerships panel\u201d uses the Transition\nPathway Initiative \u2013 which Professor Ochieng thinks is\nthe strictest code for corporate climate responsibility \u2013\nto assess potential partners. By setting high standards\nfor energy companies, he believes the Science Museum\nGroup can encourage those companies to reshape their\nfossil fuel-dominated business models faster than they\nwould otherwise.\n\u201cThe Transition Pathway Initiative only assesses\nthe climate awareness and stated intentions of fossil\nfuel producers\u201d, said Professor Waage, \u201cand may score\na company above the threshold used by the Museum\neven if their actual performance to date in reducing\nemissions is poor.\u201d For example, although BP, Shell,\nand Equinor want to be net zero companies by 2050,\naccording to Greenpeace, less than 0.2% of their energy\nproduction was renewable in 2022. The Adani Group\nconglomerate has a Transition Pathway Initiative score\nunder the Science Museum Group\u2019s demands, but Adani\nGreen specifically satisfies those demands. According\nto Reclaim Finance, the initiative does not consider\nwhether companies have scope 3 emissions targets\n(emissions associated with others burning the fossil\nfuels they extract), and understates the importance of\nshort-term reductions in carbon emissions.\nIn another link between Imperial and the Science\nMuseum, Professor Ochieng revealed to Felix that\nhe introduced Science Museum Group executives to\nImperial\u2019s Sustainability Strategy committee \u2013 which\nhe sits on \u2013 to share ideas and best practice in internal\ncarbon reduction.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that there are Imperial academics\nwho are on the board of the Science Museum,\u201d said Dr\nDave Clements. \u201cThey need to wake up, smell the carbon\ndioxide, and actually start acting for the good of the\nworld - rather than the good of the Science Museum\u2019s\nbank balance.\u201d Dr Clements was not the only one taking\nsuch stance. \u201cScience Museum managers - and this\nincludes three distinguished Trustees and Advisors\nfrom Imperial College \u2013 will be aware of the science,\u201d\nsaid Professor Waage. \u201cSo why are they permitting these\nsponsoring companies to greenwash their reputations\nat the expense of the Museum\u2019s credibility?\u201d\nI am horrified that the\nmuseum is fine with these\ncompanies\u2019 names in a place\nof information and education.\n\u201c\n\n"

As a conse-quence, the Physics department, which\nhad a disproportionately high number\nof boycotters, was unable to fully mark\nexaminations for many first- and sec-ond-year modules.\n\u2018Since staff undertaking the MAB are\nnot required to inform the College until\ntheir marking is due, the Department had\nvery limited knowledge of how severe the\nimpact would be until very close to the\ndate of the examiners\u2019 meetings,\u2019 says the\nreport on the students\u2019 complaint.\nHowever, it acknowledges that \u2018students could have been informed about\nthe developing situation and the department\u2019s plans, and could have been more\nactively involved in formulating those\nplans.\u2019 It recommends that the department should \u2018involve students in decisions about what actions to take\u2019 and\nshould \u2018keep the whole cohort informed\nin a timely manner\u2019.\nIt also recommends that \u2018the Departmentshouldbeasflexibleaspossiblewith\nregard to resit examinations.\u2019 In mid-July,\nsome modules had been marked entire-ly, and some only partially, as a result of\nthe MAB. Students were therefore given\nprovisional passes on the basis of the ful-ly-marked modules, and told they would\nhave to resit the MAB-affected modules,\nif it emerged at a later date that they had\nfailed. Students were given the chance to\nresit in August 2023 \u2013 before they knew\nwhether they had passed or failed, or al-ternatively, to resit the exam at the end of\nthe 2023/24 academic year.\nThe report recommends a change in\npolicy here: \u2018If a student now finds that\nthey will have to take a resit in summer\n2023 for a module they failed at the first\nattempt, the Department should allow\nthem to defer it to the August/September\nresit period if requested.\u2019\nThe original complaint noted that students had lost one in every 10 hours of\nlectures to strikes. \u2018We are still not receiving the education promised by the university\u2019, wrote the complainants, arguing\nthat the missed content would hurt their\ncareer prospects.\nThe report acknowledges that around\n9% of lectures in the 2022/23 year were\nmissed, but says that only 2% of the content was fully undelivered, with the remainder delivered via lecture notes. This\nfinding has been received poorly by the\ncomplainants.\n\u201cI am surprised that the department\nconsiders lecture notes an acceptable\nsubstitute for teaching,\u201d said the head\ncomplainant. \u201cThe implication by the\ndepartment is that we could learn their\ncourse using a PDF - which is not the\nstandard of teaching I expect from a supposedly world-class institution such as\nImperial.\u201d\nOthers concurred: \u201cIt feels that the department willfully ignored a key part of\nthe complaint,\u201d said a student represent-ative, who wished to remain anonymous.\n\u201cHanding us lecture notes on the final\nday of the course without problem sheets,\ntutorials, or seminars does not count as\nteaching us the content. The department\nseems unwilling to acknowledge that\nthe way they handled teaching over the\nstrikes was inadequate and seems to care\nmore about seeming to have done a good\njob than about actually doing a good job.\u201d\nThe complainants say they will appeal\nthe outcome of the report to the College\nSecretariat. Meanwhile, undergraduate\nphysicists say they are struggling to keep\nup with new content this year, as a result\nof missed content last year. Many are\nworried about their Comprehensives, exams that cover all content in the first and\nsecond years of the course.\nCarlo Contaldi, the Deputy Head of\nDepartment (Education) told Felix that\nhe was disappointed with the \u201cconfrontational tone and language adopted\u201d in\ndiscussions suggesting that students\u2019\ncomplaints amounted to a demand for\n\u201cstrike-breaking and asking students to\nchallenge picket lines\u201d, despite the student body\u2019s claim to support the striking\nlecturers and their goals. He criticised the\nstudents\u2019 \u201ccontinuous criticism\u201d calling it\n\u201cdistracting\u201d and said that if students feel\nthat they do not have confidence in him,\nthey should inform the Head of Department and he would step down immedi-ately.\n\u201cA slap in the face\u201d: Physics\nstudents dismayed at MAB\ncomplaint outcome\nNewsWriter\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\n\n"

While British Petroleum (BP) sponsors the\nScience Museum Group\u2019s STEM training academy, Shell\nandEquinorhavesponsoreditsexhibitions.AdaniGreen\n\u2013 a renewable energy company part of a conglomerate\nincluding coal mining operations \u2013 is sponsoring a\ngallery about climate change that will open in spring\n2024. Most Imperial students and staff expressed their\ndispleasure with the sponsorships, but some explained\nthe importance of the fossil fuel industry in mitigating\nthe impacts of climate change.\nWhat does the Imperial community\nthink?\n\u201cIt depends on the partnership,\u201d said a chemistry\nstudent. \u201cWe must act against fossil fuel companies and\ntheir environmental impact, but that does not mean\nangrily opposing any institution that has anything to do\nwith them.\u201d A mechanical engineering student said \u201cI\ndon\u2019t mind as the museum should be non-profit anyway.\nAlso, I don\u2019t think there are many vested interests.\u201d\nProfessor Nilay Shah, Professor in of Process Systems\nEngineering in Imperial\u2019s Chemical Engineering depart-ment, said \u201cI feel that we have a responsibility to engage\nwiththemoreenlightenedcompaniesandsupportthem\nwith transition plans as the global energy transition will\nhappen faster if the heft of the current energy industry\nis used constructively. On the other hand we are not interested in projects associated with increased extraction\nof fossil fuels.\u201d\nOthers openly voiced their support for the\nsponsorships. \u201cWorking with energy companies at the\nforefront of science, while also allowing them to fund\ncampaigns to bring science to the people is great,\u201d\ncommented a medical student. \u201cThe current hype train\nof people trying to force organisations to break ties with\nfossil fuels is ludicrous virtue signalling at its worst\u201d\nechoed Xiang Hong Tan, another student. \u201cFossil fuel\ncompaniesshouldnotberestrictedfrompartneringwith\nthe Science Museum. Science is science, not politics,\u201d he\ncontinues. \u201cYes, fossil fuel companies have a history of\ngreenwashing, but the transition to a net-zero economy\nstill requires significant scientific research and capital.\nWho else has the tremendous amount of capital ready\nto be contributed towards net-zero initiatives? \u2026 Oil\nmajors should not be shunned because of their track\nrecord.\u201d.\nOthers were vocal in opposing the Science Museum.\n\u201cMost fossil fuel companies have no interest in keeping\nto the limits of the Paris Agreement\u201d, said Dr Robin\nLamboll, a research fellow from Imperial\u2019s Centre for\nEnvironmental Policy, \u201cand their involvement in\ndiscoursearoundclimatechangeiseithertodelayaction\nor to greenwash. When the project is purely to inform\nthe public or to investigate political solutions, it\u2019s hard\nto avoid the risk of motivated reasoning to keep funding\nflowing, even when communicators and researchers\nhave good intentions.\u201d Similarly, Dr Dave Clements, a\nReader in astrophysics at Imperial, said \u201cIt\u2019s clear that\nthe current management and board of directors are\nmore worried about money than, frankly, the science -and they\u2019re quite willing to let organisations like Adani\nbe able to have some commercially motivated input into\nexhibitions.\u201d Another chemistry student agrees with\nthis, saying the museum\u2019s \u201ccontinued affiliation with\nthe fossil fuel industry shows they are not willing to put\nevidence before financial gain.\u201d\nStudentsandstaffalsoexpressedtheirdiscontentwith\nthe fossil fuel sponsorships by highlighting the Science\nMuseum\u2019s importance as an educational institution.\n\u201cAs a scientist, it\u2019s galling that the Science Museum\never accepted any relationship with such a destructive\ncompany,\u201d said Dr Julia Halder, a teaching fellow in\nPublic Health at Imperial. \u201cAs an educator, I am horrified\nthat the museum is fine with these companies\u2019 names\nin a place of information and education.\u201d Similarly,\nanother student began to \u201cdistrust [the museum\u2019s]\ncommitment to science and public education\u201d due to\nthe sponsorships.

All were waiting for\nthe row of presentations at the \u2018Pitch\nNight\u2019, an event hosted by Imperial\u00b4s\nEntrepreneur Society. Seven pitches\nby representitives of startups founded\nby Imperial alumni, all from different\ncorners of innovation and technology,\nwent on to present their unique ideas.\nThese companies aim to solve the big\nchallenges in our society: unsustainable\nfashion, inefficient medical diagnostics\nand prevention, infectious diseases,\nincompetent office management and \u2013\ninterestingly enough \u2013 insufficient startup formation.\nEach entrepreneur had five minutes\nto present and another ten minutes for\nquestions from the five guest panelists,\nrepresenting venture capitals. The\nquestions were focused on the scalability\nof the company (for example, if the\ngoal was to expand to the US and other\noversea markets), and their business\nmodel (how the company would profit).\nWhile the ideas themselves were enough\nto amaze the audience, the hardships\nand struggles of entrepreneurship\ncertainly left a lasting impression as\nwell. From funding to recuitment and\nmarketing, these entrepreneurs needed\nto navigate through them all. In their\npitches, presenters provided insights on\nthe nature and scale of the social issues,\nand how these problems have been \u2013 and\ncan be better tackled. The presenters also\nlayed out their future plans on operations\nand funding.\nThe night kicked off with Impli,\na company developing a subdermal\nimplant to monitor hormones levels for\nwomen.Thestartupaimstoaidinfertility\ntreatments, a currently expensive and\nineffectual process. The second team,\nCorma, is building a Chrome extension\nthat manages all software-as-a-service\n(SaaS) licences acquired by a small or\nmidium-sized company, streamlining\ntheir use of business softwares. RapiDx\npresented their ultrafast polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) test to detect\nurinary tract infections, sexually\ntransmitted infections and respiratory\nillnesses, providing a method for at-home screening of these diseases. The\nfourth team, fibe, introduced a method\nto fabricate strong cotton-like threads\nfrom waste potatoes, collaborating\nwith fashion brands such as H&M or\nInditex. Flexr, another biotech startup,\nworks with professional atheletes to\nimprove posture, spot health risks and\nmanage stress levels by analysing body\nmovements with artificial intelligence.\nIn an effort to make entrepreneurship\neasier, StartIn facilitates co-founders\u2019\nmeetings, news and event updates,\nand the hiring process with one simple\ncloud platform. The final presenter,\nNex.Q, is developing a machine learning\nalgorithm to reduce hospital infections.\nOf the seven companies, RapiDx was\nranked first by the panelists with its\nmarket strategy, earning a spot in the\nexclusive London Startup Fair hosted by\nImperial. Attendees had a chance to see\nthe interiors of RapiDx\u2019s custom built\ndevice, kept as a secret most of the times\nby the startup.\nThe event involved start-ups that\nhad already achieved a few rounds of\nfunding, with five to fifteen employees,\nand had worked on their idea for at least a\nyear. This surely would provide valuable\ninsights for would-be entrepreneurs\namong the audience. In an interview\nwith Felix, the event coordinator,\nJared Stoloff, a 3rd year bioengineer,\nshared how he reached out to these\ncompanies and how he selected them.\n\u201cLinkedIn is an amazing tool\u201d, Jared\nsaid, illustrating to your correspondent\nhow startup founders could be found on\nImperial\u00b4s alumni page. After a more\ndetailed study on the startups, he invited\nthirteen for an initial meeting. Seven\nwere eventually shortlisted for being the\nmost relevant for the target audience.\nAfter the presentations, the attendees\nhad the opportunity to talk with the\npresenters, learn from their experiences\nand get to know each other. Surely, the\nbrandname of Imperial helped a lot in\nmaking all of this happen. \u201cA few calls\ngo a long way,\u201d Jared explained. A simple\ne-mail got him into contact with many\nexceptional people, whom, according to\nRidhi Maheswari, the president of the\nsociety, included \u201cthe greatest minds in\nthis country\u201d.\nThe Entrepreneur Society aims to\nhost one such pitch night every term, so\nwatch out for the next one, which will\ntake place in early 2024. Of course, this\nis only one of the many events organised\nby the society. On 17th\nOctober, there\nwas a fireside chat with Michael Seibel,\nfounder of Twitch.

Published 29 years ago,\nit describes the events surrounding the\nlife of footballer Paul \u2018Gazza\u2018 Gascoigne\nthrough the 1990s. Its author \u2013 literary\ncritic and poet Ian Hamilton \u2013 passed\naway in 2001. However, his depiction of\nthe rise and fall of this talented man remains timeless. Hamilton writes from\nthe perspective of a lifelong fan, willing Gazza up the football field from\nbehind the pen. A self-styled \u2018Gazzamane\u2019, he celebrates the highs with literary\nflourish, and reports on the lows with all\nthe authority of a disapproving parent.\nIfirstcameacrossGazzaAgonistesviaa\nseries of recent tweets, showing footballers who graced the covers of the London\nReview of Books throughout the 1980s\nwith cover titles like \u2018Social democracy,\nSociology, Soccer\u2019. Karl Miller, the editor\nof the LRB at the time, pioneered, as The\nGuardian mentioned in his obituary, \u2018a\ndistinguished style of soccer journalism\u2019.\nGazza Agonistes is perfectly placed within this subgenre, and feels so far away\nfrom the current state of football critique\nwhich consists largely of clips of Mark\nGoldbridge looking sad on YouTube.\nWriting in 1993 (with an afterword\nwritten in 1998, after Gazza\u2019s exclusion\nfrom the World Cup squad that year),\nHamilton describes being attracted\nto Gazza\u2019s \u2018legendary scampers\u2019 while\nplaying for his childhood club,\nNewcastle United, and then moving to\nTottenham Hotspur, Hamilton\u2019s childhood club. This transaction of loyalties,\nfrom one man\u2019s sporting allegiances to\nthe other, provides Hamilton with the\nemotional license to report on Gazza in a\nway that is distinct from the tabloid journalists who plagued his career.\nGazza Agonistes highlights just how\nmuch the culture of football has changed\nthroughout the last 30 years. Players\nwere expected to take accountability for their own actions: justifications\nfor drunken nights were laundered by\ntabloids to be aired out in the court\nof public opinion. The concept of the\nbeautifulgameseemedmuchmoretangi-ble when those involved as players talked\nand behaved like those watching. Gazza\nwould go to the pub with his mates, like\nus; end up in fights, like us; and famously\nshed a tear, like us. There is an argument\nagainst this level of scrutiny. It destroyed\nPaul Gascoigne; why should people earning a living have to answer for their actions outside of their work?\nFor better, or worse, player engagements with social media and journalists\nare now heavily vetted. Clubs avoid risking anything that could undermine their\nimage, and in turn, net worth. Owners\nare looking to sell at reputational highs,\nwhilst fans want owners to leave when\ntheirclubsareattheirlowest.Whoknows\nwhat Hamilton would think of players\nexpected to answer for nation-states, and\nrespond to sportswashing allegations?\nAgonistes is a reminder of a simpler,\nmore passionate time in football, best enjoyed listening to the soundtrack of the\n1990 Italy World Cup, Pavarotti\u2019s Nessun\nDorma. For all of Gazza\u2019s mistakes, and\nthe treatment he endured, his epic struggles will not be repeated, neither will an\naccount as poetic as Hamilton\u2019s.\nA look back at the legendary life of Paul Gascoigne.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001a\u0018\u001d\u0014\u0018\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0018\u0013\u0012\u0017\u0011\u001d\u0016\u0010\u001e\u001a\nBOOKS\n\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001e\u0016\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001a\u0018\u0017\nIt is the reviewers who have the last word.\n\u001e\nale Fire appeals to many of those that\nlove literature. However, it is a text\nthat delights in its forms, but rather\nthan respecting the genre, clothes itself\nin a flayed skin of art, obscuring the ho-munculus beneath. Nabokov forces together a poem and its criticism to create\na higher, third text between the lines on\nthe page. He fails, I believe, not due to his\npoor writing; some of the Shadean lines,\nparticularly in the third canto, are beautiful and Kinbote is funny in his own way,\nbut due to the impossibility of what he\nis trying to accomplish. His text as much\ndeserves its reputation for literary genius as any of the vast annuals, bought by\nStar Wars afficionados, that expound on\nexactly how lightsabres work and what\nthe intestines of the Tatooine-dwelling\nsand mammals look like. If the tangential revelation of a vast world can be\ncalled masterful, they manage the\ntask far better, without the need to\nresort to cheap suggestions of madness or untrustworthiness. Pale Fire\nis a journeyman\u2019s piece. An experiment\nthat should have never left the notebook.\n\u001d\nabakov\u2019s reputation for highly\ncrafted prose makes his novels obtuse to some, often critiqued for a\nloss of soul and sensibility in favour of\nliterary games and acrobatics. Perhaps\nnowhere better does this fall than on\nPale Fire: fake literary commentary of a\nfake poem written by a fake poet. Stuck\nin his academic ivory tower,\nNabakov satirises academic\nliterary criticism, calling\nout its narcissism through\nslight references and quiet\none-liners. A myopic focus on\nrarefied prose and postmodern structure can be meaningless, but I find that\nthese aspects give the novel its punch.\nNabokov allows a cohesive narrative to\nemerge from the disparate notes of the\ncantos \u2014 maintaining the facade of serious commentary while giving enough\ninformation to instil a sense of unease\nand paranoia in the reader. Distilled to\nits plot, the novel is simply the ramblings\nof a madman, but it is through the initial\ndeceit and this particular metafiction\nconcept that the reader gains more insight into the psyche of the narrator. In\nthis case, the literary game played here is\nnot one of fanciful wanderings, but one\ndesigned to engage the reader more in its\nworld than most novels ever have.\n\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001b\u0015\u001e\u0014\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0017\u0011\u0017\u001e\u0016\u001c\n\u001b\u0016\u001a\u0015\u0017\u001c\u0014\u001c\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0010\u001e\u001f\u0017\nsand mammals look like.

I would also say\ncomposers like John Powell, who composed for the Shrek franchise and How to\nTrain your Dragon Nicholas Brittell and\nLudwig G\u00f6ransson are also other composers I enjoy listening to.\nGJ \u2013 I can tell in your work, the idea of\ntexture is quite important to you. Do you\nthink texture is of greater importance in\nfilm these days?\nRG \u2013 I feel that film music has changed\nin recent years: music in movies these\ndays is certainly moving towards a more\ntextural approach, you don\u2019t have many\nof the great melodies that you\u2019d hear\nfrom John Willimas or Howard Shore,\nbut I certainly admire the modern work\nof Alexandre Desplat, who still uses melody very well.\nGJ \u2013 You\u2019ve recently been nominated\nfor two prestigious awards, the Septimus\nAward for best soundtrack and more recently for best original music for a short\nfilm at the London Music+Sounds Awards.\nWhat does it feel like being nominated\nand recognised for your achievements?\nRG \u2013 It feels great. I think as composers we put a lot of blood and sweat into\nour work; many hours spent on our own\nwith many challenges to face. The music\nwas composed very early, and recorded\nduring a time when COVID restrictions\nwere still active, which presented us with\nthe great challenge of finding a country\nin which a symphony orchestra was allowed to record. In light of this challenge\nand all the hard work that went into the\nscore, it\u2019s great to be awarded for all this\neffort.\nGJ \u2013 Are we going to see more Japanese\ninfluenced music from you in the future,\nor will you branch out?\nRG \u2013 Earlier this year I finished working with Anna on a new project which\nI\u2019m hoping will be released soon. I think\npart of my job as a film composer is being flexible in terms of musical genres.\nI enjoy writing fantasy music but right\nnow I\u2019m working on a feature film with\nan Austrian award-nominated director\nthat\u2019s a drama shot in black and white.\nThe score is much smaller and very dif-ferent; no Japanese influences this time.\nI think it\u2019s about finding the collaborative aspect with the director and finding\nthe right language for the film; it\u2019s one\nof the things I enjoy most about being a\ncomposer, it keeps you mentally fit and it\nalways keeps you challenged.\nThis interview has been edited for length\nand clarity.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001b\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001c\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0012\u001d\u001a\u0011\u001d\u0010\n\u0016\u0018\u0015\u001b\u0014\u001d\u001c\u0017\u0013\u0012\u001b\u0011\u0018\u0012\u0010\u000f\u0011\u001e\u001d\u0012\u000e\u001b\u001e \u001b \u0019\u0013\u000e\u000f \u001b \u001d\u001c \u0013\u0019\u0017\u0018\u0012\u001d\u0011\n\n"
