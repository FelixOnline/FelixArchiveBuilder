    "content": "Dear Mr Fox\nFurther to our conversation\nyesterday (November 12th)I wish\nto inform you of the following'\nfacts concerning the disgraceful\nstate of the Junior Common\nRoom in the Sherfield Building\ncaused by a party held there on\nNovember 11th.1. That eight female cleaners had\nto be employed to clean the room\nafter they had performed all their\nnormal duties in the Sherfield\nBuilding.\n2. That these cleaners were\nrequired to remove urine stains\nfrom the cloak room.\n3. That there was broken glass on\nall floors of the S her field Building.4. That a large number of fixtures\nand fittings (eg light bulbs,\nfurniture etc) had been destroyed.\nI wish to point out that this is the\nlast example of a long series of\n'parties' where a considerable\nunpleasant mass has been left\nwhich the cleaners have had to\nclear up. Thse responsible for\ncreating the situation were\nobviously incapable of even\npartially tidying up after\nthemselves.\nIn view of these nasty and extra\nduties the cleaners consider that\nthey should be suitably recompensed. Otherwise it is the\ngeneral feeling of the cleaners\nthat we can no longer continue to\nperform such unpleasant tasks.\nYours faithfully\nJoyce Smiles\nChairwoman N UP E( See Brain Drain)\nDear Sir\nIf anyone is thinking of tabling a motion on abortion for the next\nUG M,I hope they think again.\nNo wonder that the frenzied\nfeminists and the equally fanatical\nopponents of abortion managed\nto empty the last U GM. Ninety per cent of students in\nthis college are physically incapable of becoming pregnant\nand most of the remainder would\nnot know how to, including, I suspect, Messrs Attenborough\nand Clarke.\nThe time has come for the silent\nmajority to tell both the supporters and opponents of\nabortion to stop trying to impose\ntheir views on the Union. If they\nwant to support their causes\nfinancially then let them do it out\nof their own pockets and not the\nUnion purse.\nDisgusted, Tunbridge Wells\nDear Colin\nFollowing the slow-moving\nproceedings at last Tuesday'sU GM, surely debates and speeches could be shorter in\nlength. In one and a half hours,\none motion was voted on, and a second fully debated only to be\ncut short by the stupid actions of\nsomeone yelling quo rate, not\nbecause the meeting was exceptionally small or undemocratic, but just for political ends to\nmake sure the vote did not go the\nopposite way to his beliefs (not\nthe most democratic of actions).\nBoth motions moved slowly and\nwere debated fully, even to\nexcess! Speeches for and against\nmotions could be restricted to two\nminutes, with a one minute\nextension, and speeches only\nfrom proposer s and seconds for\nand against the motion, with one\nspeech each way from the floor.\nThis may seem a restriction on\nfreedom of expression, but it\nwould certainly lead to a more\nefficient union meeting: with\nmotions being debated fully, yet\nconcisely, and more action!\nYours sincerely\nPhilip Cole\nChem Eng 1\nDear Sir\nThank heavens for the cuts!\nICU having failed (sorry - not\ntried) to help the majority of its\nmeme be rs, the Government has\nat last sprung to our aid. A6% reduction in student intake next\nyear. Just think of the implications\nof this. There will be 6% fewer first\nyears competing for places in\nHalls, houses and flats. Ifthere are\nless foreign students as well then\nthis means even less pressure on\naccommodation. Just think for\nevery one less overseas student,\nevery one less first year, then the\nbetter (less worse) is our chance\nof finding somewhere to live next\nyear. Callous thought isn't it? And\nyet assuming still more students\ncame to IC just where is ICU\nproposing to accommodate them\nall? Probably the answer contemplated involve sale swilling orgies all night, every\nnight, in the Union bar, with sleep\nbeing obtained during lectures\nand food\nWe have heard a lot recently\nabout lack of support at major and\nminor events such as rag and\nunion meetings. Setting aside the\nargument that this might be due to\nthe sheer stupidity of these\nevents, has it ever occurred that a lack of attendance might stem\nfrom the distance required to be\ntravelled to these events if you are\nnot living 'on campus'. If more\npeople could be accommodated\nnear to IC then more people just\nmight turn up.\nYours faithfully\nRJ Glass\nMech Eng 2\nSir\nA few weeks ago, OXFAM made\nan appeal to the Joint Chaplaincies of the Colleges in\nWest London to raise funds for\ntheir Cambodian relief. This\napproach was discussed at the\nChaplaincy General Meeting of\nOctober 28th, where I subsequently volunteered to organize\nthe Imperial College end of the\nCollection.\nAlthough debate was very\nunlikely, with an agenda already\nholding six -motions including\nthose on John Shuttleworth, the\nCorrie Bill, Education Cuts and\nZimbabwe (sic), I decided to\npresent a motion to the U GM of\nNovember 6th to draw attention to\nthe current events in Cambodia\nand the collection, today, for the\nvictims thereof.\nConsequently, it was with great\ninterest that I read Mr Cortazzi's very eloquent letter in last week's FELIX. I am prepared to admit that\nthis motion, prepared in a hurry\nand submitted two days after the\nofficial deadline, was somewhat\nill-informed, especially in Notes\n21 which is totally false, but I can\nfind nowhere in my motion, any\nmention that Pol Pot caused this\ndisaster, but only that he brought\nit to the present, horrific conclusion. Even so, I feel I must\noffer some reply to this letter, as it\nappears to me, far worse than ill-informed, biased. I notice that in\nhis eagerness to air his anti-Soviet\nprejudices, introduced with the\nescape-clause 'most recently', he\nfails to mention the real cause of\nthis 'prolonged war, instability\nand violence' and I quote from a leaflet provided by 'Third World\n\u2022 First':\n\"For three years from 1970\nCambodia was subjected to the\nmost intense aerial bombardment\nany country has ever experienced, by the B52 bombers of the\nUSA. The equivalent of five\nHiroshimas in tons of bombs were\ndropped.\"\n\u2022 This and the invasion by South\nVietnamese troops forced the\nCambodian peasantry from the\nfields into the cities and a previous\nfood surplus turned into a massive\ndeficit.\nUnlike Mr Cortazzi, I don't wish\nto extol the virtues of any side in\nthis debacle - in face one can only\ncondemn the expulsion of\nmillions of ethnic Chinese from\nVietnam - but I can still appreciate\ntheir problems with Chinese\ntroops to the North, Ships to the\nEast and Allies, the Khmer Rouge,\nshelling over the border from\nCambodia on the West. Whether\nor not one agrees with their\nsubsequent course of action, I can't see how it leads to the\nconclusion of ' Nazi style' expansion is m and the uli mate subjugation of Thailand. Furthermore, I wasn't aware that\nthere were over 1/2million ethnic\nChinese in Cambodia, let alone\nthat this many have drowned at\nsea at the hand of Heng Samrin.\nSo as to stop this letter getting\ntoo long, I can only refer anyone\nstill interested to articles by John\nPilger (New Statesman, Sept 21st and Oct 12th) and the publication\n'Cambodia is dying - Why?'\nproduced by Third World First.\nFinally, if Mr Cortazzi, or\nanyone else concerned at the\nplight of the expelled ethnic\nChinese 'Boat People' of Vietnam\nwould like to help in a tangible\nway, contacts me (c/o the Union)\nI 'll put them in touch with the\nInternational Volunteer Service\nwh are currently working with the\nrefugees in Kensington Barracks\nand are desperately short of\nvolunteers. Also, anyone wanting\nto help the starving people of\nCambodia, there is a collection\ntoday at IC, the proceeds of which\nwill go to OXFAM. Thank-you\nJohn Whitehouse\nChem PG Dear Colin\nI would like to take this\nopportunity to reply to those\nfellow members of ICU who, at\nlast week'sU GM, answered my\nexercising my democratic right to\nchallenge the quorum of the\nmeeting with abuse.\nFirstly, I felt that the meeting\nwas on the point of making a grave\nmistake by passing the motion\nthat was before it and the r by condoning the murder of unborn\nchildren.\nSecondly, I believe that if ICU is\nto pass such an abhor ent motion\nthen it should do so with the\nconsent of many more of its\nmembers than just the minimum\nquorum.\nI do, however, apologise to the\npeople wanted to get onto the\nother motions on the agenda, but I feel that the meeting would have\nadjourned anyway before we had\nhad the opportunity to discuss\nthem.\nSo then, I would like to urge all\nmembers of the Union to come to\nthe next U GM( on the 27th) and\nthrow out this revolting motion.\nYours\nAlan Burton\nCCD3 Dear Colin\nI think there are too many letters\nin FELIX.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Clark\nCCD3 JUST ONE\nPAGE OF\nLETTERS\nTHIS WEEK!\n2\n\n"

    "content": "SERVICES\nTHUMBS AWAY\nThere is something of an art to hitch-hiking: obviously there is an element of luck,\nbut there are ways and means of improving\nyour chances of getting a lift. The basic\nprinciple is making it as easy as possible for a driver to stop for you.\nWHERE TO STAND\nThree factors should be considered:\n1. Drivers should be able to see you easily.\nYou need to be able to give them a chance tc\nthink about giving you a lift so the further in\nadvance they see you the better.\n2. The traffic must be moving relatively\nslowly. Cars travelling at 60mph along a fast\nstretch of road aren't going to suddenly stop\nwhen they see a hitch-hiker. Find somewhere\nwhere the traffic has been slowed down:\nroundabouts are usually the best bet - stand\nabout twenty yards past the roundabout\nwhere cars can easily stop.\n3. There must be room for a vehicle to pull to\nthe side of the road - a lay-by or bus stop so\nthat they don't interfere with the rest of the\ntraffic when they stop for you.\nMOTORWAYS\nIt is illegal to hitch on a motorway and the\npolice are pretty strict on it - \u00a325 fines are not\nuncommon. The slip roads are the places to\nget a lift. Stand just in front of the sign which\nsays No L drivers, no pedestrian, etc and the\npolice don't normally move you off. At service\nstations it's a good idea to wander around the\ncar and lorry park badgering lorry drivers as\nthey come back to their cabs.\nROUTES\nThe most direct route is not always the\nquickest way to go: choose the route with the\nheaviest traffic. For example, when heading\nfor the South West the M3/A303 is the most\ndirect way but the M4/M5 is quicker. Always\ncarry a map and have a good look at the route\nbefore you start: it is useful to know where a place is before you accept a lift to it. I find\nGeographers AZ 5 miles to the inch the best\nbecause they are very clear and detailed.\nWHICH LIFTS TO ACCEPT\nThe longer the better and always bear in\nmind the chances of getting a lift from where\nthe driver drops you. Motorway interchanges\nshould be chosen with care so that you don't get stuck at one where there is very little'feed'\non the motorway.\nDon't get dropped off at interchange A because all the traffic going South will be\njoining the motorway at interchange B: get\ndropped off at the services before or an\nearlier interchange. Motorway interchanges\nare a bit of a problem because you can't hitch\nthere: again, get out at an earlier interchange.\nSIGNS\nI have great faith in destination signs,\nespecially on motorways. A sign s ya ing 'Newcastle please' at the start of the M1 isn't over-ambitious - you're likely to get a lift\nstraight there and a car only going to Watford\nisn't likely to stop for you. I find it better to\nrefuse short lifts and wait until I get one going\na reasonable distance.\nETIQUETTE\nWhere there are several people hitching it is\nnormal to form a queue facing the oncoming\ntraffic.\nGilly Anchors\nRAILWAY SOCIETY\nFor the first trip of the session it was\ndecided to use one of BR's 'Round Robin'\ntickets, which offer ac iru lar trip on scheduled\ntrains, and the route decided on was EustonCarlisle - Skipton - Morecombe - PrestonEuston.\nDeparture from Euston was at 07:45 on a particularly cold Saturday morning, and\nCarlisle was reached at 11:30. A two hour\nstop-over followed, during which the group\nsplit in two: one half to the local bus-station,\nand the other in search of food. After lunch\none of the group remembered that Carlisle\nhad the only nationalised pubs in the country,\nand this resulted in our sampling the local\nbrew (not very good). As it turned out the\nbreweries here were de nationalised in 1972,\nbut it was a good excuse.\nDeparting from Carlisle on a train for\nSkipton, we made our way over the Settle\nand Carlisle line, which was the object of the\ntrip. The line is one of the most scenic in BR's current passenger network and some very\ngood views of the Northeren Pennines are to\nbe had from the many high viaducts on the\nline. The passage of Long Meg viaduct, which\nis sharply curved, resulted in one of the group\ntrying some interesting acrobatics to obtain a photo of the head of the train. Stopping Settle\nstation proved interesting as the train was\nsome three times the length of the platform,\nresulting in our pulling up at the station\nseveral times and drawing forward repeatedly.\nDeparting from Skipton after changing\ntrains, this time the train was a LeedsMorecombe dmu rather than a loco hauled\ntrain, we made our way along the line to\nCarnforth. Clapham station was a point of\ninterest, as Richard Dunsford had some\nsignalling equipment from here. The station\nturned out to be very archaic and the former\nsignal box had long since disappeared along\nwith the branch line to Tebay on the West\nCoast main line.\nA longish stop-over in Morecombe again\nsaw the group dividing into the bus-freaks\nand those more interested in food. A visit to a restaurant on the sea-front saw us served\nwith food costing twice as much as we had\nordered, and after some interesting language\nwe left, somewhat lighter in the pocket than\nintended.\nThe journey back to Euston, changing\ntrains at Lancaster and Preston was after dark\nand saw us reaching Euston again at 22:40.\nAn interesting trip and well worth repeating\nat some point in the future, if future rail-se vice cuts don't see the Settle and Carlisle line\nbeing axed, as has been threatened from time\nto time.\nChris Veale\nICU OFFICIAL\nCAMBODIA\nCOLLECTION\nTODAY proceeds go to OXFAM for\nthe relief of the victims of\nthe famine in Cambodia.\nHUMAN RIGHTS MOTION\nThe Human Rights Motion presented\nat the last U GM will be brought to the\nnext UGM on November 27th. Copies\nof the United Nations Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights are\navailable from the Union Office or me:\nTim Hillyer, Maths 3.\nSTOP PRESS\nTwo squash courts in the\nSports Centre are now\navailable to be booked.\nPHOTOSOC\nNext Wednesday (November 21st), we\nwill be visiting the Royal College of Art\nphotographic department in Cromwell\nRoad. The people going will be shown\naround the place and there should be\nan opportunity to take some pictures of\nmodels (who will hopefully be\nprovided).

Playing with\nthe wind in the first half, the 3rds ran rings\nround the 2nds static midfield. The break\nthrough came when A Betts failed to hold on\nto fierce shot from Esberger and D McPhail\nran into score. A typical sparkling run from\nArmstrong left Merrit with a clear cut chance\nwho blasted the ball home. After the break the\nwind got worse and the battle then looked all\nuphill, especially as P Lakin brilliantly guided\na looping cross into his own goal.\nImmediately after the restart, A Donaldson\nheaded in from a corner to make the score 3-1. At this point the 2nds started to play a little,\nwith an effort from D Dean just skimming the\noutside of the post, but the defence held out\nlike the Berlin Wall. With time running out for\nthe 2nds, tempers began to fray with Phil\nNiccolls boiling over but the situation was\nsoon rectified when A Cable dealt with him\naccordingly. Then with a good move up the\nleft hand side from A Phillips and A Donaldson, D McPhail ran in to tap home his\nsecond which wrapped it up 4-1.\nRules and Prizes\n1) MAX RANGE WINS-Prize is 50%\nof takings.\n2) Darts to be made of PAPER and\nSELLOTAPE, or GLUE.\n3) Darts to be MAX LENGTH 2ft, MAX WINGSPAN 2ft.4) First 2 Throws 10p Subsequent\nthrows 5p.5) Competitors must agree to abide\nby judges decisions.\n6) In the interests of safety each\ncompetitor is requested to obey\nthe directions of marshall s.

After scoring a penalty in the first five minutes, it looked as\nthough the underdogs might be in with a chance. However, RCS soon moved into the\nlead with a try by Tim Latham, following a superb run along the wing by Robin 'Boy\nWonder' Richards. Will Price increased this\nlead when he crossed the IC line from a five\nyard scrum. Going into the second half with\nthe wind behind them, RCS were looking for a big score. The continuous pressure on the IC\ndefence led to one or two scuffles, but the\nreferee kept the game under control. Robin\nRichards scored the try he had earned in the\nfirst half, after a particularly uncoordinated\nIC three quarter had dropped the ball. A Tim\nLatham penalty made the score 15-3. IC\nmanaged to get back into the game briefly\nand Bob Thomas, IC's best player by far,\nbecame the first man to cross the RCS line\nthis season. There was never any chance of a shock def at for RCS, and Paul Holley.soiled\nthe victory with a try in the final nj nute s, making the final score 19-7 to RCS. Finally, everybody in RCS rugby wo un like\nto congratulate John Norton on being\nappointed captain of IC 2nds.

The force\nwill be under the control of the British\nGovernor.\n10,000 STEEL JOBS TO BE AXED\nBritish Steel Corporation will close its plant\nat Shotton with a loss of 6,420 jobs by March.\nA further 2,500 ancillary jobs will also go.

After Pope John Paul made it clear\nthat he could accept no slackening in the\ncontraception rulings one Vatican priest said\nthat making changes to these laws would\n\"solve most of his financial problems\novernight. Contributions from Catholics in\nthe US would quintuple in gratitude. But don't tell anyone I said so.\"\nSUNDAY11 ZIMBABWE/RHODESIA: TWO DAY TALKS\nDEADLINE\nIf the talks fail to move further in the next\ntwo days, Britain is prepared to per sue a one-sided settlement with Bishop Muzorewa.\nBritain's basic plans for the transitional\nperiod will be put forward to the PF for a final\ndecision.

The new company\nwould not make programmes or own studios\nitself but commission them from the other TV\ncompanies and outside producers. The \u00a36080million a year needed to run the new\nchannel would come partly from each ITV\ncompany in the form of a subscription and\npartly in sub sid is ation from the main ITV\nnetwork.\nCARTER STOPS IRANIAN OIL IMPORTS\nPresident Carter, to make it clear that\neconomic factors would have no influence in\nthe US dealings with Iran over the embassy\nsei ge, ordered an end to all American oil\nimports from Iran.

From the 29th November to the 6th December ICU is presenting\nEnvironmental Week.\nA quick flick through the pages of any of the big nationals will turn up news on progress,\ndevelopment and decisions all concerning the Environment. These issues will affect the\nquality and type of life we will all have and shape the future.\nIt isn't news to any bo by that this is a critical and crucial time for these issues. What is i he future of nuclear power after the Three Mile Island incident? What about the 250 sq. km\narea proposed for mining in Belvoir-is it the jobs.the coal or the view which is more\nimportant?^ With a proposed cut in the grant to London Transport what is the future of tho-buses? WlAk.\nThese and other current issues affect people in every department in this.college in every\nsubject. Environmental Week has daily debates and discussions on all the topics which\nconcern you, with views from both sides.\nThe subjects range from 'the chemical aspects of f aiming and food production' to the\nnuclear power question and Britain's future energy policy. For each topic we have the\nspeakers that really matter; Sir Derek Ezra, David Owen, The Lord Flowers, Tom Burke,\nProf Scorer, Dr Goddard, Mr North from ADAS, Mr Sandford from the GLC and many\nmore. Also featured will be an Env Fair on Wed 5th December. At this, over a pint of\nbeer, you can meet many environmentalists and researches, see relevant films, listen to\nspeeches etc etc. So keep this date free. This week will also have its action spot. The\nweekend of the 1st and 2nd of December all those interested can go and effectively\ncreate an adventure playground for London children. Building structures, painting\nmurals etc means it should be great fun.\nIn next week' FELIX we will be putting in part 1 of the ENV WEEK PULL OUT. This will\ngive a run down of the topics for discussion,times.venues and speakers. So watch out for\nthis and keep the dates free in your diary and also look out for the day glow posters which\nyou will be going up shortly.\nLast week we published two en v articles, one being an anti-nuclear argument. During the\nweek you will be able to hear both sides to the argument allowing you to construct your\nown personal opinion.

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE BILLIARDS AND\nSNOOKER CLUB\nTo be or not to be, that was the question.\nThe answer: NO! The league no longer exists.\nThat thunderous ly popular plaything of\nSans hit Teapot has ceased beyond reasonable doubt, to exist. But still, IC A and\nB teams managed to play friendlies. The A team played LSE. Jeffrey Donald Stlkes\nKeymer played first and I must say', he does\nseem to have lost some of his cud d lines s maybe due to his visit to the 'Clinic' but he still\nmanaged to thw ape his opponent who was a bit good; OK! Second on was Chris Von Tripp\nwho was heard humming 'My Balls are Alive\nWith the Sound of Music', but this didn't affect\nhis screwing or positional 'fore'play and he\nwon by kilometres. Next to the table strode\nDave 'Burton on the Button' Crosslove, in a matching two-piece suit in pretty brown (crap\ncoloured). Continually grooming himself, he\nspiff ingly won the match - jolly good show.\nOnto the table came Teapot, who was told\n'get down from the table. You're not in the\njungle now'. Getting down, he removed his\nbanana and picked up his cue. He won easily\non the b w own. Last on was Martin (by special\nrequest) Pwoudlove. His head came through\nthe door followed a minute later by the rest of\nhis body. He shrunk to his normal seven feet\nand started with the game where he easily\nbeat his opponent (in the head maybe!).\nTeam: G Keymuir (Capt), C Tripe, D Crosswire, S Teapot and M Proudlover.\nThe B team played Charing Cross. It was\nonly friendly so after Leclezio has beaten up a few of his own team members, they got down\nto the serious business in hand. Alan ' JR R Tolkein' Leclezio, who has often given cloth\nripping performances, said during the match\n'this is even more enjoyable than being a garden gnome'. I can't believe that\nblasphemy, and if fairyland find out, I'm sure\nKing Fairy will banish him to Gobbledy\nGobbledy land. But he won anyway.\nThere's always one in the team and Uncle\nBulgaria has produced a real nur d specimen\nthis season. Tomsk committed the cardinal\nsin of losing and must suffer the inevitable\npenalty - a compulsory season ticket to\nChelsea Football club (no flogging it to\nSanshit).\nHow could Chris Calvert follow this! He\ncouldn't: Our Sekretry Steve Jeans did. What\na Brutus he is. He wrangled some good\nmoves and gained some leeway. He levied the\ngame his way and after some FUs from the\naudience, he won to make the score 2-1.\nHow could our mild mannered ace Seamus\nArmstrong follow this (note repetition). He\njust looked his opponent in the eyes and\nSeamus' gloomy smirk, froze to a redundant\npla zm a, his opponent. His opponent was just\nlove lost and the games was of no mor\ninterest, so Seamus won. (I hear his\nopponent has a broken heart). Last on was\nKrezewski and after ten minutes name\nbartering, he beat hs opponent to a degenerate, worm eaten, wombat do's pulp.\nTeam. A Leclezy, T McLemon, S Genius\n(Capt), St Headstrong and J Crezoosky.\nOn Saturday the Snooker Plus Tournament\notherwise known as Trippy's pocket money\nsession was held. Initially only six people\nturned up, but this was increased to nine, so\nwe formed three groups of three. In my group,\nAlice, Damian 'Omen 2' Kelly and I. Alice\n'Goldilocks' Cameron was one up against me\nwhen Sanshit decided to form a knock-out\ncompetition so using expletives like s....t, b.... t.d, c...t,f.. k.r and w.. k.r, Alice forced\nSanshit to feebly apologise and the\ncompetition continued, the final was played\nearly on between Tripp and Keymer which\nwas traumatic ally won by Tripp.\nEarlier on, in the quarter finals, Alice\nbrought off a formidable humiliating two-nil\nvictory over 'Chalky' T^e lock and was heard\nto iterate, 'I 'll let my rockets off tonight' and I CROSS COUNTRY\nAfter a bit of struggle, having arrived at\nGuildford with only two runners due to their\nbeing another race on in London as well, we\nmanaged to get together a team for the Stag\nHill relay after meeting Mark Pickard there\nwho opted to run twice and by borrowing\nanother two runners.\nThe race was a6 x2 mile relay and was on\nthe roads around the campus and was a very\nfast course.\nThe first runner off was Gary Longhurst\nwho strolled round coming in in a mediocre\n20th position to hand over to Mark Pickard\nwho as usual ran well bringing the team up to\n7th position as he handed over to Russ\nWeston who ran well against a very fast field\ncoming in 19th. The fourth runner off was Dave Barret who\nalso found the course rather fast coming in\n24th handing over to our guest runner Derek\nTENPIN BOWLING\nA promising 8-2 defeat. The club played its\nfirst Universities and Colleges TBA match\nlast Saturday home to Brunei. For a change\nthe organisation went well, perhaps too well,\ngiving us three full mens' teams, the full\nladies' team and even two reserves. On top of\nthis everyone arrived on time (just) despite\nthe Secretary's amazing navigation - from\nPrinces Gardens to Hammersmith Bridge via\nBattersea Bridge!\nSo far, so good. Then the match started.\nThe first game (of three) looked hopeful. The\nfirst team were continuing from their success\nof last year. The seconds also won, the ladies\ndid well in losing narrowly, but the thirds were\nannihilated. However Brunei first and\nseconds put up excellent bowling performances making our first struggle to get\ntheir win. The seconds lost despite great\nbowling from Joe Ng, Albert Yue and Robert\nCheng, all with 500 series: the thirds and\nladies were defeated heavily following good\nfight backs.' A promising defeat' I said? Well, as\nexpected, Brunei have a strong team and had\nplayed two matches prior to this, our first. It is\nbeat that wiley Irish punta nist and mod\nDamian Dermot Kelly (beg or rah).I got\nhammered by Tripp in semis and Alice just\ndidn't bother to play Keymer so the\ncompetition and it was all down to the\nDenmark for a game of space invaders - It's about time they had one in college instead of\nthose useless games in the Union Lounge!\nThe Great Gareth\nwho maintained the same position to hand\nover to the unstoppable Mark Pickard who\nmanaged to regain three places in a field that\nwas by now a bit spread out, to finish the race\nin 21st position.\nThe race was won by Borough Road\nCollege with their 2nd and 3rd teams\nfinishing 2nd and 4th, the 3rd team home was\nBristol University.\nAfter the race we were able to fill ourselves\nup at tea having tickets for two teams\nalthough we only had one team, although this\nwas only after we managed to retrieve the tea\ntickets which some idiot had given in with the\nvaluables.\nHaving thus indulged ourselves we bade\nourselves farewells to our guest runners and\nthe two of us headed back to London whilst\nMork rode off into the sunset bound for\nanother race.\nhoped (by an optimistic Exec) that\nSouthampton and Portsmouth will not be so\nstrong. This remains to be seen.\nTeams\nFirst: Ron Johnson, John Knight, Brian\nMacGowan, Danny Lau and Tubby Woo.\nSecond: Albert Yue, Lawrence Poon, Nigel\nHeath, Robert Cheng and Joseph Ng.\nThird: Neil Hunt, Ray Cook, Nigel Windsor,\nJOe Wong and Tim Hillyer.\nLadies: Delia Wong, Ruby Wong, Merhala\nThurai, Marie Cheong and Louisa Lau.\nAnd special thanks to our reserves: Robert\nThong and Paul Jeynes.\nThe League is progressing well; but there\nare still a few vacancies in teams. Of course\neveryone is welcome to come along.\nTransport arrangements have altered slightly\nin that minibuses and/or cars will leave Aero\n(opposite Beit Arch) on Wednesdays at 2:30\nprompt.\nSee you there,\nTim.\nPS - If any of the Exec bowl a sub - 100 game\nin the League or in a match, the guilty party\nwill stand a round in Stans.\nIC SAILING CLUB\nThe first event of the season, the Foot\nTrophy was held at the Welsh Harp Reservoir,\nlast Saturday and Sunday,1011 th\nNovember. This three boat team event\nattracted sixteen entries from as far away as\nCornwall and Rochdale, and included-an IC\nteam, and the UL1 st team which has four IC\nmembers. Teams were split into two groups\nof eight with the top two in each group going\ninto the semi-finals.\nIC's first match was against the much\nfancied Wembley 1st team, which we won.\nThis was followed by easy wins over United\nHopitals and Cambridge, two very close\nmatches. This completed the first day's programme, with two more qualifying\nmatches to come, and our chances of\nqualifying still in the balance.\nIn Sunday morning's first match, the UL ladies put up no opposition at all, but we were\nwell beaten by Granchester (ex Cambridge)\nin the final match. This put us fourth in our\ngroup, and so we failed to qualify.\nUL 1sts, meanwhile, qualified with only one\ndefeat, but lost narrowly in the semi-final to\neventual winners Custaways (consisting of\nex UL members).\nAll in all this was a promising start to the\nseason by IC against some very good\nopposition.\nIC team: John Williams (Captain), Dave\nCulshaw, Alan Beaney, Nick Ajderian, James\nBaxter, and Colin Murray.\nUL 1sts team: Dave Derby (IC), Geoff\nTitmuss (IC), Jan Robson (IC), Chris Lewis\n(IC), Mark Rushall (Chelsea) and AN Other\n(UC).\n15\n\n"

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Friday, November 16th,1979 Issue No. 534\nFREEZE ON CCD EXPENDITURE\nThe Computing and Control Department's staff/student committee heard, on Tuesday\nevening, that CCD is in a dire financial\nsituation. With commitments such as staff\nsalaries and maintenance taken into account\nCCD is already \u00a340,000 in the red for the\nwhole academic year. As a result Professor\nLehman has ordered a complete freeze on all\nexpenditure, in the hope of bringing the true\nnature of the situation home to the college\nauthorities. As the Head of the department\nexplained at the CCD fresher s dinner at the\nend of October the situation has arisen\nbecause the department if funded at the same\nlevel as a mathematics based subject. Its\nfiscal needs, however, correspond to that of\nan Engineering Department.\nIn the long term Professor Lehman is\nhoping that when the Mathematics and\nComputing subcommittee of the University\nGrants council visit the department, next\nMarch, they can be persuaded to re-classify\nthe department. This would theoretically\nincrease the amount of money allocated by\n\u00a3200 for every full time student.\nIf the present freeze on expenditure is\ncontinued it is expected that the supply of\nline-printer paper will run out by the end of ter\nline-printer paper will run out by the end of\nterm. First year students face additional\nproblems in that the supply of punched cards,\nwhich is the only form of input medium used\nby CCD1, will be exhausted within 3 weeks.\nICRN\nMISSING PAINTING\nA painting has gone missing from the\nBotany-Zoology Common Room. It was\ntitled, \"Phenomenal Cardinal Wingspan.\" It is\ndescribed as a bright, modern depiction of a butterfly. The college is particularly anxious\nto trace the work, since it is on loan from a professor. The painting is insured for over\n\u00a3300.\nAny information regarding its whereabouts\nshould be given to Mr. Dawson, the chief\nSecurity Officer (Room 165 Sherfield\nBuilding). A photo of the painting will appear\nin next week's FELIX.

Well done, all those\nwho turned up in shorts, corks and sandals,\nwe are believed to have demolished 70 cases\nof Swan.\nThe following day a dozen bleary-eyed and\nsore-headed Minespersons crawled into\nMines at 8:30am, donned overalls, helmets,\nlamps and six-packs and. set out for the Lord\nMayor's procession. Having found the float\nand IC Jazz band we duly processed through\nthe city and took over the bar of the London\nMetal Exchange float and then processed all\nthe way back again. We were congratulated\nby quite a few people on the liveliness and\noriginality of our float - special thanks must\ngo to Andy Lewis and Pete Gilligan for all\ntheir work up to and on the day.\nOn Monday, a group of blasphemers went\nto Piccadilly Circus to see 'Life of Brian' and\nthoroughly enjoyed themselves. If you\ncouldn't get a ticket - sorry but try earlier next\ntime.\nHighlights of the well-attended UGM on\nTuesday were the unusual slides of the great\nand good Wyn Jerkins, the semi-abortive hit\non T Rev and the awarding of the 'Git' tie to\nPaddy Hoskin.\nAll those who turned up for Chaps CJub's Ragarama In the evening thoroughly enjoyed\nit. The fastest times for orally peeling a banana were Keith Baldie (Mat Sci 2) and\nPete Newman (Min 2) both with 3.0 seconds.\nIn the peel off Keith Baldie won and duly\nacquired the prize of a bottle of sherry. Final\nevent of the evening was the obstacle race\nwhich was won by Barney McCabe (Physics\n2) who proceeded to down the contents of his\nprize - a glass yard.\nAnd so to Wednesday and MORPHY DAY.\nA thousand thanks to all those who rowed\nand fought their guts out for Mines. Special\ncongratulations must go to Morphy 8. We\nwon the oar (of course) after a tough battle -well done everyone!

    "content": "THE\nSHORT-LIFE\nHOUSING\nGROUP\nThe aims of the short-life housing group\nare:\n1. TO FIND UNUSED PROPERTY\nFinding houses is easy! All you do is walk\naround with your eyes open with a pencil and\npaper at hand.\n2. TO DISCOVER THE OWNERS\nThe council are a useful source of\ninformation, or just ask the local people.\n3. TO PERSUADE THE OWNERS TO ALLOW\nTHE GROUP TO USE THE HOUSES\nThis is sometimes the most difficult as some\npeople take a bit of persuading.\n4. TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY REPAIRS\nObviously, the time that the property is\navailable for is an important factor. If it is\navailable for over five years then we are\neligible for a Mini-Housing Association Grant\n(Mini-HAG). For shorter periods, only a few\ncouncils give you a grant.\n5. TO LIVE IN THEM\nNormally the occupants pay only the rates\nand bills with a small rent being payable to the\nGroup. This would in fact add up to about five\npounds a week.\nThe advantages of this scheme are that it\ngives you the chance to work as part of a group and with people outside college. There\nare many people with useful skills such as\nplumbing and plastering etc., on the dole who\nhave more time than students. Two\nsuccesses of the group are at:\n1. Shepherdess Walk, Hackney: These\nhouses are in a bad state of repair, but with\nthe aid of grants and a lot of support they are\nbeginning to be habitable.\n2. East Sheen: At the other end of the 33 bus\nroute. A four bedroom house, which needs\nminimal painting and wall-papering but\nwiring may need attention, any offers of help\nwould be appreciated.\nIf you want a cheap place to stay for next\nyear then you have to start NOW! Interested\nperson, please see Michael Arthur, Welfare\nCentre.\nJan Czernuszka\nAt the time of writing Rag Week is almost\nhere and several people in RCS are looking\nknacker ed already. This is simply a result of\ntoo few people trying to do too much be it\nconcerned with Jez, the rag float, Broadsheet\nor rag collecting.\nThis is a situation which cannot be allowed\nto develop into one which many large\nnebulous institutions will appeal for help, the\nresponse to which is a surfeit of willing\nvolunteers. They come along only to be told\nby the clique at the top that everything is fine\nand their help is not needed. Insult is added to\ninjury when they are later told that the job was\ndone by the same old people.\nAs I am sure you app pre cia te by now, RCS\nis not like this and any cliques that do exist\nare eminently join able. Over the next week\nyou can prove this for yourself by supporting\nthe rag events which spec if i ally involve RCS.\nStart this afternoon and tomorrow morning\nby helping with our rag float (in the office)\nand continue by going on the procession in\nthe afternoon (collect cans from the office\n' from 12:00 hours onwards).\nSupport would also be welcome for the raft\nrace on Sunday and if your Exec let you down\nin anyway you can always take your revenge\nby torturing them on Thursday lunchtime.\nLots of support is also required on Tuesday\nfor the disgusting games at lunchtime -makes a change from a Mooney and for the\nFox/O 'Boyle insignificant event in the\nevening.\nEnding on a bright note Steve White\ncollected over \u00a3100 for rag last weekend and\na showdown with Zoshia is expected soon.\nOn the subject of chemists our Ents\nChairman in his infinite wisdom is organising\na night out to see 'The Life of Brian' on\nDecember 4th, so watch out for details or ask\nyour Soc Reps.\nIf you have any complaints about the Union\nor you're just naturally inquisitive you can\nfind most people that matter and a few that\ndon't in the Union Bar most Sunday evenings\nafter Officer's meetings.\nSee you there!\nNick Watmough\nCITY AND GUILDS\nLast week was quite quiet as far as Guilds\nwere concerned with the only event of note\nbeing the Lord Mayors/GUILDS Show where\nas one of the two free student entries we\nshowed London who GUILDS are. We were\nseen doing a Boomalaka by about 10,000,000\npeople on BBC TV and some of us were\nshown in close-up (the stardom is going to\nour heads). The show was great fun and\nthanks to all those who helped build the float.\nON to all the future events....\nSATURDAY 17th is the Rag Procession,\nstarting from the Union Office at 11:30. This\ntime we have a street collection licence so we\nwould like as many people to turn up and\ncollect as possible.\nSUNDAY 18th has the inter C CU raft race at\n10:00am in Princes Gardens so come along to\ncheer us along. There is a rugby match in the\nafternoon with some star names, so meet at\nBeit Arch at 11:15am if you want to go and\nwatch.\nMONDAY is the Aerosoc Paper Darts\nCompetition at iu nch time in Beit Quad, so\nany budding aircraft designers should make\none and turn up.\nTUESDAY sees the day we present some\nreally disgusting competitions In the Quad at\nlunch tine. THURSDAY is the Exec torture when buckets\nof ye uch are put all over the Exec members\neveryone loves or hates.\nFRIDAY is the GUILDS' Carnival, tickets\nshould still be on sale at \u00a32.50 from the Union\nOffice so hurry up and don't miss this\nastounding event.\nHIT SQUAD\nIf you want anyone hit with a custard pie\nduring Rag Week contact Mr N Kalsi or Mr P Leggett in the GUILDS Office with details of\nwho you want hit, where they can be found at\nvarious times and any other helpful\ninformation. The prices are as follows:\n50p students\n\u00a31.00 notables (ie Exec members etc)\n\u00a35.00 lecturers (they must agree to be hit)\n\u00a325.00 Lord Fs Bryan\nC& GU Publicity Officer\nTHE BRAIN DRAIN\nSQUASH COURTS\nTemporary repairs have now been made to\ntwo of the courts, and these are now available\nfor use.\nROOM BOOKINGS\nAny member of the Union can book rooms\nin the building (and JCR) to hold a party etc.\nfree of charge, but a deposit is required in\ncase of any damage being down or mess not\nbeing cleared up properly.\nI must stress this point about cleaning up\nafter parties; on Sunday night someone using\nthe JCR made no attempt at cleaning up and\ndid a considerable amount of damage, which\nhas resulted in them being fined \u00a3140. (The\ncleaners felt so strongly about the mess, they\nwrote a letter: See letters' page).\nBOOKSHOP\nSome people have commented to me that\nthe bookshop doesn't stock (or often runs out\nof) books which are particularly recommended by their department. Any\nsuggestions on this matter (or any other ways\nin which people think that the bookshop\ncould be improved) should be given (in\nwritten form!) to their Year Academic Rep or\nDepartmental Rep who will hand them on to\nme.\nNOISE\n% Some Beit residents have complained to\nme about the amount of noise made by some\npeople leaving the Union late at night,\nparticularly as they go through the Archway\n(which I live directly above). My solution is\nsimple: I 've put a bucket of water on the\nbalcony outside my room. Watch out!\nMALCOLM\nUNIVERSITY\nCHALLENGE\nFREE TRIP TO\nMANCHESTER\nICU is taking part in University\nChallenge and Granada TV is\nproviding a coach, leaving Union\nArchway, Beit Hall, at 1:00 p.m, next Wednesday, 21st November.\nNames to JEN, IC Union Office.\n\n"
