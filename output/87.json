    "content": "2 FELIX& m \u00a3i \u00a3e: Dr. Weale\nKenneth Edward Weale spent ht s undergraduate\ndays at Aberyswyth, where he obtained a first in Chemistry, and, after a brief excursion into\nindustry, came to I.C. as research student in1946. His cunning and methodical brain caused him to plan\nhis research programme with great care. He spent\njust over two years doing experimental work, then\nhe performed superfluous confirmatory experimental\nwork until the summer, so that he could combine\nwriting his thesis with spending every day at Lord's or F. 'arlington.\nHe is one of the few members of staff who take\nan active interest in Union affairs. He is the Hon.\nTreasurer of I.C. Union as well as President of the\nCricket Club and a Vice-President of the Rugby foot-ball Club, Students will be relieved to hear that\ntheir Treasurer is very thrifty: even Mrs. Robinson claims that it took her five years to cadge a sherry from him.\nIn his student days Ken gained a purple in both\nboxing and rug ger. He has twice been with I.C. Rugger ci ub to Delft, some of whose students believe\nhi a to be the hero of the fano us old English rug ger song \"Round and round went the bly great Wheel.\"\nHe sits on the Middlesex Rugby Committee.\nPerhaps Weale has achieved most notoriety in his activities as a cricketer, in which capacity he\nmodestly styles himself \"The Great Doctor.\" He bats\nwith a rare and graceful artistry, his most impressive]\nstroke, which he frequently brings into play, is a firm forward push wide of mid-on, which sends the\nball over the slips'heads for two. His innings\nhave varied from brilliant to dismal: on one\nsingular acca sion he struck 67 not out (including\nsix sixes) in29 minutes. In another innings he\nspent over twenty minutes in scoring nought. His\nbowling prowess is rather an unknown quantity:\nlast year the only occasion on which he was put on\nto bowl was in a Sunday match, when he himself,was\ncaptain.\nHis alertness of mind, so essential to a cricketer was demonstrated when he narrowly averted a road accident by changing the car he was driving\nstraight from fourth gear into reverse.\nHis likes are Devonshire cream, which he\nhas-been known to consume at14 lb. at a time, and\ncats. He is evasive about his dislikes, hut claims\nthat his most infuriating experience was when\ngiven out lb w by W.P. Goss at Cambridge.\nHis qualifications as sub-warden of the Hostel\nare legion. His dignified and burly appearance once\ncaused him to be mistaken for the house detective\nin a large Torquay hotel. It is rumoured that in the days of his early youth he attempted, whilst* living in a hostel, to sail across a pond in the\ngrounds in a wardrobe drawer. He has been known\nto refer to the Hostel as a \"Palace of Sport.\"\nOne way and another Weale gets through a vast amount of work. One could only wish that more\nmembers of staff were prepared to devote so much\ntime and energy to the extra carri cula r activities of college life as he is.\"n \"th. Floor,\nEast Wing,\nBeit Building,\nDear Sir, Whilst browsing through the back numbers\nof the Ministry of Education reports, student\nfunds; the legal aspect of; I was struck by ths\nlack of for sight and imagination shown in the\nMinistry. The reports deal with lotteries, pools\nplans (and this incident ly, makes most interesting reading. There was one case where the Principal of\na famous university won \u00a375000, and promptly\nabsconded with the funds - but that is digressing),\ncharity 'Rags', sporting and cultural entertainment\n(a sort of open day so that the man in the street\ncan see how his money is being spent). Now and\nthen a large \"help the poor des it ute student\" camp-ain is organised - but this generally fails in its aim, for it seems that the only person who wants\nto help a poor des it ute student is another poor\ndestitute student.\nAs I have already said, there exists a considerable lack of for sight among the people\nwhose duty lies in raising money for students.\nI am a naturally lazy man, and as such, I naturally look for less energetic - and more certain ways\nof raising the necessary finances. \"Why,\" I ask\nmyself \"why cannot the existing sites of buildings\nbe used to advantage? The ins ides are used - why\nnot use the outsides?\" And following this train of thought, I stumbled upon the answer which has\nbeen found everywhere but here. Advertisments are\nlegion - look at Pica dilly Circus, where, every\navailable vertical( and sometimes horizontal) area\nhas been used to advertise. Why cannot some of our\ncollege buildings be treated in the same way?\nWe've never thought of it that is the answer.\nAESTHETIC YET UTILITARIAN - NEW-LOOK FOR THE HUXLEX.\nAnd the aesthetic need not be sacrificed for the utilitarian. No, indeed, the cultural value of the buildings can be enhanced by discriminate advertising. Take the Beit Building, for instance. A large, full leng h poster for \"Luxury-foam\" mattresses at 1st floor level, ladies\ngarments to the west, gentlemen's underwear to\nthe east, and crowning all, a\" Per sil washes whiter\"\nin neon lights. Put a \"Drink more milk, and keep\nfit\" on the new Aeronautical and Chemical Engineering Building - and the students keep fit while\nMr. Mooney sells more milk, makes more profit, and lowers the price of meals even more. It works from every angle, as the Americans say.\nYours, etc.\nAlbert Lentil. "

    "content": "4 FELIX\nViewpoint by\nEgnHSTOM AMD THE 8.CfC.\nD.M. Wells\nIn ths Autumn Number of Phoenix and the last two\nissues of Felix there hare appeared comments on some of the\nproblems confronting the Social Clubs Committee, both at\nthe present time and when the expansion scheme iso cmp let e. The most notable thing about these comments is that while\nmuch space is devoted to the pros and cons of schemes for\ndecentralisation, very little is said about the problems\nthemselves. The writers of the previous art lo les are no\ndoubt well aware of the problems involved, but in my view\nwe must know ex a otl y what has to be solved before any off\nthe discussion about possible solutions can become! profit-able.\nAs I see it, the S. C.C.'s difficulties may be classified under three main headings: 1) Finance, 2) Representation, 3) Administration, and it is by their effect on\nthese that any so he mes for reorganisation or limitation of\nmembership must ba judged. Muoh lias already been argued\nabout the intrinsic merits of small specialised or sectarian clubs as opposed to larger ones catering for many\npoints of view, and I do not intend to add any more to\nthis discussion. I must, however, say that in my opinion\nit should be aba sio pri no ip le that any group of people\nwith a oom mon interest is entitled to form itself into an\nofficial I.C. club, provided that the problems outlined\nbelow can be overcome. In other words, there should be\nno question of preventing the formation of clubs as a matter of pri no ip le. The financial problem is certainly the most acute ana.\nMoney for the various clubs i3 granted in bulk to the\nS. C.C. by Union Counoil and it is the unenviable task of\nthe S. C.C. executive to divide this amount fairly between\nthe clubs, according to their estimated needs. It is al ready necessary for some of the clubs' own estimates to be\nreduced to prevent de ju i> nd \u00ab\nu u>< jedi ng available supply, and\none of the arguments against the formation of new clubs is\nthat they can be financed only at the expense of existing\nones. Ho doubt more money will be available as the Onion,\nincreases in size, but the needs of existing clubs may\nalso be expected to increase, and if the increase in numbers leads to the need for several new clubs the position\nwill grow steadily worse.\nIf the reasonable assumption is made that the money\nfor social activities is never likely to be unlimited, any\n' solution to the problem of finance would seem to require\nthe introduction of a system by wh i oh the money allocated\nto each o lub could be impartially assessed in relation to\nits contribution to College life. A possible alternative\nwould be the creation of certain o lub s prepared to have\nall the advantages of official recognition save that of\nsupport from Union funds. Unfortunately, the first of\nthese alternatives demands a person or committee with Solomen-like qualities, and the second presupposes a rather\nradical change in human nature. However, I think it is along these lines that a solution will have to be sought.\nThe size of the*.CO., and its composition, present\nthe second main problem. The efficiency of any committee\ntends to fall off in proportion to its size, and it is difficult to reo on oil e this with the need for representation\nof all interests. This will of o our se become worse as\neach new club is formed. There is also the potential\ndanger that if a large number of small clubs were represented the voting of the committee might on occasion not\nrepresent the opinion of the majority of club members.\nThese problems seem to call for some form of reorganisation,\nbut whatever form this takes it is unlikely to please every-body.\nFinally, there is the problem of administration. This\nis really an aspect of the size problem, for the1 large numbers greatly increase the normal executive work of a com-mitte e. Arising from this is the danger that, with the\nbest of intentions and through sheer necessity, work wh i oh should be done by the whole committee has to be left to the\nexecutive. This may create the feeling that the oom mitte e is controlled by its executive and that it is itself there\nonly to advise and not to make decisions.\nI have tried to outline the main problems of the S. C.C.(w hi oh are probably shared to some extent by other Union\norganisations) as I see them, and I do not pretend to know\nany of the answers to them, if indeed satisfactory ones\nexist. I hope no one will accuse me of casting reflections\non the work of the S. C.C. or of any of its officers or members, because that is net my intention, nor have I any a xs to grind. These comments will have achieved their purpose\nif they stimulate members of the Union to thought and discussion about a problem wh i oh closely concerns them and\ntheir successors.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR NIL DESPERANDOM\nDear Sir,28 th. Jan. 19S6 Tour leader in the last Fekix suggests that\nyou believe an interest in culture to be waning\nat I.C. This is not borne out by Onion Library stat is tc s. Based on the rather scanty figures available, during the period 1930-39 about 6.5 % of the student\npopulation ware members of the Union Library, During\n1945-54, the corresponding average figure is almost\n18* and is slowly rising. I know that there are other factors than an\ninterest in culture to account for this almost three\nfold increase in reading. However, although the\nLibrary Committee deplores the fact, that only one\nstudent in five takes the trouble to borrow books\nfrom us, there is every indication that present\nday students are more interested in general reading\nthan were their predecessors of almost a generation\nago.\nTake hope. Sir. Remember, there was not even\na\" Felix\" six(?) years ago.\nYours faithfully, Peter Rowe\nChairman, Union Library Committee\nPRAISE FOR NELSON\nDear Sir, R.S. M. Bessemer Lab.\nI would like to congratulate you for having\npublished in\" Felix\" Nelson's \"Guide to the Womenrts\nColleges\". However, though this guide has been\nsadly needed for a long time.I fear that it is in complete and in one instance even wrong.\nThere are certainly more than fourteen women's colleges in London within fairly easy reach of I.C. and I hope that in the near future a complete\nguide can be drawn up giving more information. For\ninstance, how many people know where the Froebel\nEducation Institution is? Also this guide could\nbe widened to take in Nurse's Homes and give warning-to which to avoid.\nYours Etc.\n\"Hop Happy\"\nREDUNDANT U.L. U. CARDS?\nDear Sir, R.C.S. Union Lounge\nFebruary 5th.1956 Much has recently been said of the uselessness\nof the U.L. union cards issued last term. I contend\nthat these cards will in time prove their worth\nand should therefore be kept. I used my card\nrecently y not for its primary purpose but to gain\nadmission to the union premises of another university. No do up tIsh all be able to find further uses for my card; such as obtaining cheap student\nrates for entrance to shows of exhibitions.

Meanwhile, in the front of their very noses,\nReggie was given his coat of many colours by Our\ntwo painters, the artistic character of their attentions not being realised until it was too\nlate. The participants then made good their escape\nwhile the might of Kings was still too stunned to\n\u2022Ike a move. Brian Oggi again played a distinguished\npart in the retreat.

This will offer improved facilities for for ie gn and provincial tu dents in transit through London or visiting for a few days.\nA proposal was made at the last I.C. General Meeting that the Union should rejoin the N.U.S.. and since the President said such\na motion needed notice, it has been formally\nsubmitted for consideration at the next Union\nMeeting,\nImperial College has been a member of the\nN.U.S., but left for various political reasons,\nThe Union officers have always felt it their, duty to provide for the social and athletic activities in the College, and to avoid association with anything bearing a political tag.\nThus we left N.U.S. after a very short membership in T939 when it suggested that all students\nshould have exemption from military service, and\nthe jr should register as pacifists to achieve\nthis end.\nImperial College joined again after the war,\nthough the Royal School of Mines refused to be\nassociated with this act of the ipa'rent; union.\nFollowing the red scare years after the Berlin airlift, the College left again because of the\npolitics of the N.U.S., who had sent its officers to Moscow. The Royal College of Science remained\na member for a further two years.\nThe cost to the College at present to be a member of N.U.S. would be one shilling per head,\nthough this will increase to l/3d. next year.\nIndividual students may be members for10/ per\nyear.\nThe advantage of being in N.U.S. must be\nconsidered to see what value we get for this sua.\nIt gives the College societies a chance to\ntake part in various contests and festivals: debating, drama and folk-dancing are the chief\ncurrent activities. Individuals can get cheap travel facilities through chartered aircraft, though these are\navailable outside the N.U.S., and holiday tours\nare also organised by other travel bureaus, A labour exchange is provided for vacation work,\nthough since many Imperial College students\nmust have technical training, this is not so\nuseful. One must pay extra for this service\nof the N.U.S. and its organisation appears to\nbe too bureaucratic;, but no doubt it provides a service for those lacking initiative. What is probably the most important adv ant. age is that it gives students recognised represent-at ives. At present the N.U.S. claim to represent\n75* of the students of this country. With a100% support they could command more respect. They\nhave been recognised by the government to the\nextent of serving on various Ministry of Education committees. Although this might be decreed\nas a political activity, it gives students, or\nat least their representatives a chance to\nexpress their views.\nThe present President of N.U.S. is a Conservative. Hence the close lias on with the Government\nand the support for affiliation by the Conservatives in the College. Other members of N.U.S. and possibly future Presidents have opposing\npolitics, and hence the Socialists in the College\nsupport affiliation. Both sides seem confident\nthat theirs will dictate policy.\nWhether I.C. Union joins and is associated\nwith one side or the other, or whether it preserves its political independence will be\ndecided at the next General Meeting.\nCOMPETITION.\nMr Mooney of Mooney's( formerly known as\nQueenies) invites comment and advice on the layout\nof Ayrton Hall during the lunch hour so that\nmaximum efficiency and speed of service may be\nobtained. Please send your suggestions to the\nEditor \" Felix\" the most original of which will be printed in the next issue.\nTHIRTY YEARS AGO.\n\"Almost the only science which has not been\npractised at South Kensington is town planning.\"\nQuotation from University Reform in London by\nT. Lloyd Humberstone, published in1926. Ne/son V Co/um n AN INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE concerning a no-parking sign has been passing between the I.C. and Cambridge Boxing Clubs following the match\nat Cambridge. We v nder st aad that the sign has\nnow been returned, with an additional inscription \"with the compliments of Imperial College.\nTHE OLD BOGEY. 85% of all high school graduates\nin Spain enter a college or university; however,\nin comparison with the number of first semester .\nstudents, only a relatively small per sent age completes its university training: at the medical\nfaculty58%, at the judicial49%, arts 48%,\nveterinary 40%, pharmacy 38%, natural science\n25% and at the faculty for political and economic\nscience only 11%,\n(Revista de Educacion, Madrid)\nTHE SOCIALIST SOCIETY hope to hold a spiritualist meeting to which George Bernard Shaw and\nLenin have been invited. THE WRONG IDEA. Any member of the Carleton\nCollege Students' Association found drinking\nalcoholic beverages on college property will be brought before the College Judicial Committee\naccording to a recent decision of the Student\nCouncil. Punishment will range from fines to>\nexpulsion from the Students' Association.\n(\"The Carleton\", Ottawa)\nSAYING OF THE WEEK. \" I will look at any additional evidence to confirm the opinion to which I have\nalready come\"- Mr. Hugh Molson, Parliamentary\nSecretary, Ministry of Transport.\nTHE WOMENS' COLLEGES: I am quite aware that there\nare a number of errors in my guide in the last edition and while a polo gi sing, would nevertheless\nlike to remind my critics of the difficulties inherent in such a survey. For example, I fear that there is one error due to the fact that the\nfilly who gave me the information on one college\nwas trying to dispose of my attentions at the\ntime. As G do not think there are any errors due\nto a converse trend in my affairs( no place\nstated as staying open all night), I am thankful\nto \"Hop Happy\" for reminding me about the Nurses'\nHomes (the Editor tells me you don't need to go\nfurther than one Nurses' Home and he seems to\nknow). But returning to the errors, a number of\npeople have wrongly contradicted me.bega use the\nregulations had changed since they last knew\nthe place; regulations change quite frequently\n(when they are tightened up, there is usually\na good story somewhere).\nTONIGHT'S THE NIGHT. Reviewing the film\"0 Dreamland\", John Gale writes in the Observer:\n\"On entering Dreamland, the amusement park,\nyou are first invited to see a model of the\nelectric chair which dealt with the Rosenbergs,\nthe atom spies; then \"Torture through the Ages\"\"You must see torture by burning oil\" implores\nan unctuous voice, \"your children will love it\".
