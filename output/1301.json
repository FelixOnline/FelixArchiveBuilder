    "content": "Horror movies are a fine art. Many\nhave failed because the audience\nare disappointed unless they\u2019re\nscared witless and go home with the\nfear of God in them. The problem\nwith horror movies is they are an\nintrinsically personal entity. What\nmight petrify and paralyse one man,\nanother would scoff and sneer at. So\nlet me enlighten you: Saw terrified\nme to the very core. Yet, watching it\nwas bordering on enjoyable \u2013 I can\nnever understand why people don\u2019t\nlike a good horror movie. Maybe it\u2019s\njust the sadomasochist in me speak-ing, but I love being frightened.\nI\u2019m not afraid to admit that I actually screamed at one point during\nthis movie, something I have never\nexperienced before (so don\u2019t start\nmaking judgments about me yet).\nWatch the movie, and if you don\u2019t\njump, you\u2019ll deserve a medal. To\ncapture the imagination and attention of an audience as well as Saw\ndoes is unique.\nA good horror film is a rare treat.\nTouted as the best horror movie\nsince The Blair Witch Project, Saw\nis a disturbing yet meaningful movie.\nOne of the most fiendishly inventive\nthrillers for a long time, it is a troubling and violent film that merrily\nplays with your mind as it twists and\nturns through its tricky and menacing plot.\nSaw tells the story of two men,\nAdam (Leigh Whannell) and\nLawrence (Cary Elwes), who mysteriously awaken in a dilapidated\nbathroom, both chained by the ankle\nto steel pipes from which there is\nvirtually no chance of escape, with\na blood-soaked body between them.\nNeither man knows how or why they\nare in this situation. To say any more\nwould be an injustice to the film.\nSaw has some horrifically imaginative deaths and a filthy, soiled\nappearance that is comparable to\nSe7en. The structure of the movie\nconsists of flashbacks that work fantastically well in keeping you puzzled and guessing. When the truth\nis revealed and all the pieces start\nfalling into place, the film becomes\nenthralling and riveting. To say that\nyou could not tear your eyes from\nthe screen would be an understate-ment. To say that you would be\non the edge of your seat would be\nan understatement. No matter how\nhorrific or gruesome the scene, your\nsheer curiosity carries you through\nthe movie.\nCinematography and soundtrack\nwork in harmony to generate a bona\nfide sense of claustrophobia and\ndisorientation. The tension really is\ntangible at times; the silence of an\naudience can be deafening. The costume of the villain is one of the most\nunsettling elements to the movie,\nand not since Stephen King\u2019s It have\nI been so unnerved by a simple\ncostume. Cleverly, first time director Wan leaves a lot to the imagi-nation, leaving your imagination to\nrun riot.\nSaw isn\u2019t without its flaws\nthough. Whannell, who is also the\nscreenwriter, is average at best.\nHis performance at times is laugh-able, especially in the emotionally\ncharged scenes. The same can be\nsaid of Elwes. Their lack of talent\nis a real shame in such a cleverly\ndevised movie. The supporting cast,\nGlover and Leung, are steady and\ndependable, if not amazing.\nForegoing the supernatural for a\nmore realistic serial killer protago-nist, this is the kind of horror film\nthat is really chilling. It will stick\nlong in the memory, no matter how\nhard you try to forget it. Brilliantly\nterrifying, yet masterfully intelligent\nand original, Saw is a rare breed of\nmovie.\nAlan Ng\nFilm Editor\nGo see Saw!\nEvery piece has a puzzle...\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 14 October 2004\n22\nSaw\nDirector: James Wan\nStarring: Leigh Whannell, Cary Elwes,\nDanny Glover, Ken Leung\nLength: 100 minutes\nCertificate: 18\nHHHHI\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nHow much blood would you shed to stay alive?\nLayers of fun? Or not, as the case may be...\nGet Carter. The Long Good Friday.\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking\nBarrels. Snatch. What does this\ntell you about the British gangster\nmovie? That there are already far\ntoo many of them? Yes, perhaps.\nOr that they\u2019re good, so let\u2019s have\nsome more. That must have been\nMatthew Vaughn\u2019s reasoning before\nhe decided to direct Layer Cake.\nAs described in its awful trailer\n(involving a pompous cookery show\npresenter listing all the different\n\u2018ingredients\u2019 that make a good gangster movie), Layer Cake promises\na heaped tablespoon of violence,\nchopped up film-making, a dollop\nof swearing, and a pinch of sex \u2013 all\nserved in a piquant cockney accent.\nSuffice to say I expected a generically modified Lock, Stock and Two\nSmoking Barrels clone.\nThe plot surrounds, in no particular order, a nameless London\ncocaine dealer, a Yugoslavian neo-Nazi sect, a bunch of incompetent\ncockney gangsters, the missing\ndaughter of a rich English aristo-crat, five million pounds worth of\necstasy, and a hired killer by the\nname of Dragan who specialises in\ndecapitations.\nPrepare to be slightly under-whelmed by the acting, which lacks\nthe vitality and rawness of the cast\nof Lock, Stock. Layer Cake stars\nDaniel Craig (The Power of One,\nTomb Raider) as \u2018X\u2019, the hero of our\nstory. It also stars Dexter Fletcher\n(Gamesmaster presenter, and also\nfrom Lock, Stock) and Shakesperian\nactor Michael Gambon (Gosford\nPark) as a wealthy, violent aristo-crat.\nThe director, Michael Vaughn, was\nthe producer behind Lock, Stock and\nSnatch. Unfortunately, what Vaughn\nfails to understand this time is that\nyou can\u2019t have your Layer Cake and\neat it. The reason why the aforementioned gangster films were successful is because they were original\nand they did something different.\nThat is what led to the revival of the\nentire genre. However, Layer Cake,\nas demonstrated by the trailer, is\na very conscious attempt to latch\nonto the tail end of our forgotten\nfascination with hyper-violence and\ncriminal Londoners who compulsively break the rules.\nGuy Ritchie made Snatch and\nLock, Stock look like a piece of\ncake. But Layer Cake is laboured,\ntedious and self-conscious. Unlike\nJason Stretham, the verbally agile\nand convincing star of Lock, Stock,\nDaniel Craig looks like a constipated\nGordon Tracy from Thunderbirds\nand sounds like the voiceover from\nThe Magic Roundabout.\nUndeniably, the film has some\nmoments of entertainment thanks\nto some MTV-style hyperkineticism\nand moments of belly-chuckling\nhumour. But from the first scene,\nwhich had shades of Ray Liotta\u2019s\nopening speech in Goodfellas, we\nare presented with a movie that fails\nto serve up something fresh and\noriginal, essentially being a badly\ndisguised collage of a host of other\ngangster films. Every scene has\nbeen done before, every character\nportrayed in the recent collective\nmemory.\nSo the question is, are the public\nsick of seeing British gangster mov-ies? Have we had enough of cockney\nhardmen bowling around shouting\n\u201cListen you muppet, you\u2019re a slag\u201d\nand then shooting some poor guy\u2019s\nface off? The answer, I think, is yes.\nParadoxically, given its relatively small budget (\u00a34 million) Layer\nCake will inevitably make money.\nHowever, as with Donnie Brasco\nwhich was the last great American\ngangster film, Layer Cake marks the\ndenouement with which the British\ngangster movie genre has, finally\nand inevitably, been exhausted.\nDarius Nikbin\nLayer Cake\nDirector: Matthew Vaughn\nStarring: Daniel Craig, Dexter\nFletcher, Michael Gambon\nLength: 104 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHIII\n\u201cNo matter how\nhorrific or gruesome\nthe scene, your sheer\ncuriosity carries you\nthrough the movie\u201d\nSaw has a filthy, soiled appearance comparable to Se7en\n\u201cPrepare to be\nslightly under-whelmed by the\nacting...\u201d\nin association with\nOdeon Kensington\nsee What\u2019s On, page 12\nWant to review films, get free tickets and go to previews?

    "content": "10 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 14 October 2004\nFEATURE felix@ic.ac.uk\nGraduating and leaving university\nis a big step for anyone \u2013 not only\nfinding a job, but choosing the right\none. As an Imperial graduate, there\nare certainly more choices avail-able, from working in industry to\nworking in the City, but very few\npursue their interests and try to\nmake a career of them.\nI am doing just that. Without realising it, I was building up my business during university by developing my interest in photography. I\ntook photographs, wrote to readers\u2019\ngalleries in photographic maga-zines, and designed a website, www.\nalexfineart.co.uk. The positive\nfeedback I received from people,\ncoupled with my own desire to do\nsomething completely different, set\nme a challenge to pursue a career\nas a freelance photographer.\nAs soon as I had completed my\nexams I was out taking photographs and building up my port-folio. Initially I had broad photographic interests in order to get a\nfeel for which area appealed to me\nthe most. However, it is always at\nthe forefront of my mind that it is\nbest to be a master than a jack of\nall trades. So, although I am still\nat an early stage in my career, I\nknow I will be concentrating on\ncityscapes and landscapes in the\ncoming months.\nNow I have built up a reasonable\nsized portfolio, it is important to\nmarket the images to as wide an\naudience as possible. I have discovered that, although web-based marketing can work well once you are\nestablished, people initially want to\nsee your work before committing to\na purchase. So I pursued galleries\nto exhibit my work. Fortunately,\nI have been given my debut exhibition Light, Direction, Reflection\nat the Blyth Gallery at Imperial\nCollege (level 5, Sherfield Building)\nwhere I am exhibiting photographs\nof London and Imperial. The three\nthemes symbolise decision-making:\ninitially you have an idea (light)\nthat you follow through by taking a\ncertain course of action (direction)\nand finally you reflect on your decision (reflection).\nAll photographs in the light theme\nare black and white, helping to\nemphasise the contrast within each\nphotograph. Each image shows a\nsource of light, whether it be natural or manmade, to which your eyes\nare drawn. The recognition of this\nlight should reflect the belief that\nyou have seen your idea. Having\nhad this idea, you choose to act on\nit and decide on a course of action.\nDirection symbolises the journey\nwe face in taking a decision, and the\nnames of the photographs in this\ntheme are meant to mirror some\nof the processes we use in deciding\nour course of action. Contemplation,\nfocus, the walkway and parallels\neach describe a different aspect of\nchoosing and following through our\ncourse of action. Once any decision\nhas been taken, it is within our\nconscientious character to reflect\non our choice. The final theme,\nreflection, explores reflection within architectural photographs.\nThe black and white photographs\nin light are more classical, whilst\nboth direction and reflection show\ncontemporary colour photographs,\nmany of which are of Imperial\nCollege.\nIt has been a huge learning experience so far, planning and setting\nup an exhibition. It can take weeks\nto obtain the right photographs,\nwhich must then be printed,\nmounted, framed and hung in the\ngallery. Alongside all of this, you\nhave to market yourself, approach\npotential sponsors and advertise\nthe exhibition. I now understand\nwhy most photographers spend\na month taking photographs, followed by a month solely marketing\nthem. Although I have only started relatively recently, I have soon\nfound that making new contacts\nfrequently is essential: writing a\nletter to someone could just spark\nan invaluable opportunity. It is that\nelement of luck that I relish as a\nfreelancer.\n\u25cf Alex Holland\u2019s exhibition\nLight, Direction, Reflection is\nin the Blyth Gallery, on Level\n5 of the Sherfield Building.\nAdmission is free.\n\u201cIt can take weeks\nto obtain the right\nphotographs...\u201d\nPursuing photography\nImperial graduate Alex Holland on the early stages of his career as a freelance photographer\n\n"

Critics say\nthat the only way to achieve\nthis fairly is to have a much\nmore transparent admissions system, with students\napplying to universities only\nafter they know their A level\nresults. Other suggestions\ninclude individual module\nmarks appearing on the\nUCAS form, and the development of new aptitude tests,\nlike those already being used\nin medical and veterinary\nschool admissions.\nWhether the admissions\npolicy of Bristol does contravene human rights is an issue\nthat will have to be decided in\nthe courts, but the report may\npersuade the Government\nthat the way forward for\nadmissions is to develop tests\nand interviews that examine\nthe ability to learn of the\nstudent, and not the level\nof coaching that has taken\nplace. Taking students\u2019 backgrounds into account in the\nadmissions process may be\nfairer, but this also demands\na lot of time in interview and\ncannot ever form a perfectly\nfair system.\nWhichever selection method does take place in the\nfuture, it seems certain to\nbe post-results, meaning that\napplications are not wasted\nand only those students with\nthe appropriate grades need\napply to a particular course.\nSelecting more state school pupils may\nbreach human rights of those rejected\nWho gets to come here?

I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s in anyone\u2019s best interests for me to continue in\noffice.

The\ntiming of the decision was\nparticularly surprising, coming at the beginning of the\nacademic year and just after\na successful Freshers Week.\nWhen Felix asked him why\nhe had offered to resign, Mr\nArif replied: \u201cHey. Things\nhappen.\u201d\nBy Wednesday, the\nPresident had decided to stay\non, and was confident that\nhe was \u201cthe best person for\nthe job\u201d.

    "content": "I had forgotten how much I love the\nTate Modern. Making the trek down\nthe District Line, I fully expected to\nstay in the gallery for about half an\nhour to take in a new photography\nexhibition, and ended up wandering\naround for most of the afternoon.\nIf you go to one gallery in London\nthis year, make it this one. Where\nelse do you find such a mixture\nof modern masters and experimental spaces? Where else can\nyou walk straight from works by\nPicasso, Modigliani and Spencer,\nto a massive sound-video installation showing nocturnal animals\npassing through the artist\u2019s studio\nat night (Mapping the Studio by\nBruce Nauman)?\nIf you do go, take the time to find\nthe west door and enter through the\nTurbine Hall. This towering industrial space usually houses a large-scale work of art, and the glass roof\nand steel rafters make a fantastic\narray of shadows in the space, demonstrating that floor-to-ceiling concrete can be beautiful.\nThe exhibition I went to see is\nby a Malian photographer called\nMohamed Camara, born in 1985,\nand who only started taking photos\nin 2001. All this makes him a bit\nintimidating. His works are the third\npart of a series called The Public\nWorld of the Private Space, which\nshowcases new works by international artists not well known in the\nUK. This is in fact Camara\u2019s first\nexhibition in Britain, and his first in\na public gallery.\nThe exhibition contains a collection of about 60 photographs and a\nvideo, all of which deal with domestic subject matter from Camara\u2019s\nhometown, Bamako in Mali. What\nis immediately striking about the\nphotos is their intense use of light\nand shadow. Many depict everyday\nscenes inside dark houses partially\nilluminated from blinding sunshine\ncoming through doorways and cur-tains. The pictures demonstrate poverty \u2013 Mali is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, mixed with accents of\nwestern life such as football shirts\nand adidas shorts, illustrating the\ninfluences of youth culture.\nCamara captures movement and\nactivity as if it were an accident from\nunusual viewpoints, like glancing\nthrough a window, around a corner,\nor reflected in a mirror. He takes the\nposition of an impartial onlooker \u2013 it\nis as if his presence is accidental,\nyet many of the shots are set up,\nand his exceptional use of vertical\nlines, light and shade, strong blues\nand earthy browns are reminiscent\nof portraiture and still life, without\nappearing contrived or false. Their\nintimacy and use of angle implies\nthat rather than looking in on life,\nthe artist is looking through the\ndomestic scene around him into the\noutside world.\nCurtains and drapes, along with\nthe blinding sunlight they shade, are\nimportant in this series. They are\nused to hide aspects of the domesticity Camara is capturing, and to\nreveal intimate details of the lives\non show. Camara repeatedly captures sleeping or relaxed people,\nand the contrasts of white light and\nblack shadows deaden these scenes,\ncreating an intoxicatingly drowsy\natmosphere.\nThe video, Les Rideaux de\nCamara, 2004, continues the theme\nof curtains as focal points from the\nphotograph collection. It consists of\na series of interior shots of curtains\nblowing in the wind, and records\nthe movements in and out of the\nhouse. These are representative of\nthe recurring theme of viewing the\nbright, light outside world from the\ndark interior. The continual fluttering of the curtains reveals the scene\nboth by showing the exterior activ-ity, and by momentarily illuminating the inside of the house. These\nshafts of light catch the texture of\nthe walls, the objects on the floor\nand the edges of figures, intrusively\npermitting a slight glance of the\nlives surrounding the static position\nof the camera.\nThe images are hypnotic \u2013 the\nrepetitive billowing of the curtain,\ntheimpenetrableblackoftheinterior\nand the sporadic movement around\nthe viewer, who gains a viewpoint\nof intimate observation of a routine\nwith a continuous, timeless quality.\nThey capture mesmerising domesticity of faceless people, and though\nthe actual view changes frequently,\nthe overall impression is of repeti-tiveness and normality described in\nan honest and intimate way.\nIf you are interested in photography and emerging talent, this\nexhibition is certainly worth seeing.\nTaking time to look closely at the\nimages reveals a wealth of intricate\ndetail and gives privileged access\nto a private world.\nIf you\u2019re not tempted by this\nexhibition, take the time to go\nto the Tate Modern anyway. The\npermanent collection is an excellent combination of more famous\nworks and emerging talent \u2013 it\u2019s\nnot all piles of bricks! Each time\nyou go, things have changed and\nthere are new areas to discover.\nFor example, I found a storytelling opera describing the process of\nsexual differentiation in the womb\nusing images from fantasy, Celtic\nlegend and fetishism. The work,\nCremaster 5, by Matthew Barney, is\ndescribed as a \u2018personal mythology\nfor a fragmented world\u2019 and ends\nwith one man dropping from a vine\nand another sinking in the Danube,\nsymbolising the dropping testicles\nand creation of a male baby. Odd,\nbut certainly creative. Enjoy.\n\u25cf The Turbine Hall this week\nreceives its latest installation.\nFor our enjoyment (at least until\n28 March 2005), the Tate Modern\nhas commissioned American artist\nBruce Nauman.\nNauman is known for his use of\na wide variety of media in his art.\nFor this project, he has chosen to\nproduce a sound work featuring the\nhuman voice.\nThe Turbine Hall installations are\nknown for their power and innovative approaches to what we fondly\ncall art. Hopefully Nauman\u2019s contribution to the Unilever Series\nwill live up to the expectations of a\npublic that was stupendously spoilt\nlast year by Olafur Eliasson\u2019s The\nWeather Project. For those of you\nwho can\u2019t remember what that was,\nI mean the one where the Sun was\nindoors.\nIt has also been announced that\nUnilever have decided to extend\ntheir sponsorship of the Turbine\nHall installations by a further five\nyears. So, if Nauman proves to be a\ndisappointment, at least we should\nhave five more chances of seeing\nsomething as good as last year\u2019s\ninstallation.\nOn a slightly related tangent:\nNauman studied maths and physics\nbefore finding his calling.\nHypnotism at the Tate Modern\nEmily Lines visits the third instalment in the Tate Modern\u2019s series of displays of new\nwork by artists rarely exhibiting in the UK\nPhotography exhibition\nUntitled: Mohamed Camara\nTate Modern\nAdmission free\nThe Tate Modern, just in case you don\u2019t know what it looks like, from St Paul\u2019s Cathedral\n\u201cThe images capture\nmesmerising\ndomesticity of\nfaceless people\u201d\nI\u2019ve been doing a quite a fair bit of\nwalking around town lately, as one\noften ends up doing when showing a\nvisitor round. Apart from the resulting aching legs and sore feet, not to\nmention a renewed lack of faith in\nLondon Transport, the whole experience has been quite enjoyable.\nWhen you live in London you miss\nso many sights, or in my case you\nreally begin to take them for grant-ed. Not only is London bursting at\nthe seams with museums and gal-leries, but we also have a fantastic\nnumber of historical sights and a\nwealth of glorious architecture.\nLondon has examples of so many\ndifferent architectural styles (though\nI must say that all this awful sixties\nstuff has to go, and soon if at all pos-sible). The timescale that the architecture spans here is vast \u2013 there are\nRoman remains in the City and even\nwe at Imperial are at the vanguard\nof design with our very own Norman\nFoster business school entrance.\nArchitecture is most definitely a\nform of art, but unfortunately it is\none that is mostly forgotten by both\nart lovers and philistines alike. So, if\nyou know something about architecture or are at all interested, please\nfeel free to inform the rest of us\nthrough these pages. My own knowledge of architecture doesn\u2019t stretch\nmuch beyond Inigo Jones and a very\ndetailed array of useless information\nabout Chiswick House for which I\nhave GCSE History to thank.\nOn another subject, I went to the\nopera quite recently, and more of\nyou should do so too. Opera is quite\npossibly my favourite art form, and I\nlike to plug it as much as possible.\nThe Royal Opera\u2019s season is well\nunder way, as is that of the English\nNational Opera at the newly refurbished Coliseum. Both are currently\ndoing productions of Mozart operas,\nso there are no excuses not to go.\nMozart always writes good tunes,\nand he can also be funny (unlike\na certain Mr Shakespeare whose\nsense of humour has not really stood\nthe test of time as well as it could\nhave).\nAs I have a little bit of space left to\nfill: Marcelo Alvarez is a wonderful\ntenor who should be heard, even if\nonly on a recording.\nPAOLA SMITH\nARTS EDITOR\nRamblings on the subject of art (and walking)\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 14 October 2004\n20\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

After being banned from\nplaying with The Libertines due to\nhis continuing drug problem, he has\nnearly been imprisoned for an offensive weapon charge and earned a\nreputation of not turning up to his\nown gigs (of which one no-show\nin Aberdeen was greeted with a\ncrowd riot). He was expected to\npathetically fall from grace, but this\nconcert was a warning sign to such\nnaysayers that he is still capable of\nperforming a blinding rock and roll\nshow.\nGreeted with electrified cheers\nfrom the audience, Pete wasted no\ntime in ripping into the set opener,\nMan Who Came To Stay. Backed\nby his group Babyshambles, who\nshowed they were capable of pounding out jagged rock that could rival\nthe Libertines, Pete was clearly\npleased to be performing. He sang\nhis lungs out and even launched\nhimself into the crowd twice, whilst\nall the time being given the crazed\nsupport that most would only associate with a Michael Jackson concert.\nHe even got the crowd to sing along\nwith him when he performed Happy\nBirthday for guitarist Pat Walden.\nDespite this, you could see that all\nwas not well with Pete, which was\nevident from his wandering attention span in the early stages of the\nset. However, it snapped back when\nit came to references to his past,\nsuch as the snarled lyric \u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe difference between death and\nglory\u2026\u201d on Fuck Forever, and the\naccelerating/decelerating Gang\nOf Gin, which blasts his former\nLibertines bandmates.\nThe tempo slowed halfway through\nthe set, when he was joined by\nformer Massive Attack vocalist Dot\nAllison for a few acoustic numbers,\nbut the main treat of the evening\nwas the three beautiful renditions\nof old Libertines favourites Don\u2019t\nLook Back Into The Sun, Time For\nHeroes and What Katie Did, the\nformer accompanied by a stunning\nand surprising xylophone arrange-ment.\nAfter this, the gig went back into\nfull-on rock mode, which Pete does\nbest, and after an hour\u2019s set which\nended with the thrashing Wolfman,\nhe left the stage with the crowd in\nhysterics. Despite what the music\npress might say about him, this\nnight showed that Pete is still on\ntop form, and even if the Libertines\ndo go under, the Arcadian spirit will\nstill be carried on, which can only be\ngood news.\nMatthew Hartfield\nBabyshambles\nKing\u2019s Cross Scala\nHHHHI\nThe esteemed Mr\nMillen makes his\nreturn to these pages\nFree tickets\nAfter a week with no competitions (shock horror) we\u2019ve\nmanaged to lay our hands on a couple of tickets to see\nthe excellent Seether at the Mean Fiddler on Tuesday 19\nOctober.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of them, Seether featured on the\nSpiderman 2 soundtrack and are absolutely huge in South\nAfrica, where they are originally from. Their debut album\nwas among the top sellers of the year in their home country\u2019s anaemic rock market.\nTheir new single, Broken, features the vocal stylings\nof Evanscence singer Amy Lee and is out right now. The\nrecord has been produced by the well-known nu metal producer Jay Baumgardner, who\u2019s also been involved with acts\nlike Papa Roach and Drowning Pool.\nSeether are flying into the UK to play three gigs, and this\nis their only one in London. If you want to win these two tick-ets, just answer this simple question: What was the name of\nEvanescence\u2019s all-conquering number one single?\nAnswers to music.felix@ic.ac.uk please, with \u201cSeether\ncompetition\u201d in the subject line.\nBabyshambles: the ever coherent Pete. Why does he even bother to wear a guitar?\nI bet this band truly believe the\nhype they\u2019ve been gathering. They\nprobably think they\u2019re \u201cquirky\u201d and\n\u201cthe next big thing\u201d. Gaining much\ncritical acclaim, especially following\ntheir tour with fellow merchants-of-mediocre The Ordinary Boys, the\nKaiser Chiefs (depressingly) may\nhave their dreams come true.\nThey\u2019re a bit like Franz Ferdinand\nwithout the originality or risqu\u00e9\nhomoeroticism, or Dogs Die In Hot\nCars without the \u2018being good\u2019. I wish\nI could describe it more, but my\nbrain is shutting down after having\nthis on repeat for the last ten min-utes. I think there\u2019s some honky-tonk keyboard, a quiet bit, some\nhandclaps maybe. You get the idea,\njust don\u2019t get the single.\nJames Millen\nNormally, I\u2019d try to put an attention-grabbing opening paragraph here,\nbut Marilyn Manson needs no intro-duction. You know who he is, your\ngranny knows who he is, and she\ndoesn\u2019t think he\u2019s at all the sort of\nperson you should be listening to.\nBut when was doing what you should\never any fun?\nPersonal Jesus, the single taken\nfrom Manson\u2019s best of album Lest\nWe Forget, fits neatly into the great\ntradition of his previous covers: as\nwith Sweet Dreams and Tainted\nLove, he has taken a faintly drippy\neighties classic and invested it with\na generous shot of the anger and bile\nthat made him famous. The result is\nless vitriolic than might have been\nexpected, but it\u2019s damnably catchy\nand, like much of his music, surprisingly fun to dance to.\nWhile it\u2019s true that these days it\u2019s\nmore about the spectacle than the\nmusic for Mr Manson (was it ever\nnot?), it\u2019s also true that he really\nknowshowtoputonashow.Matching\nthe decadent aesthetics of his recent\nalbum, The Golden Age of Grotesque,\nwith its spooky synths, jerky beats\nand hoarse vocals, Personal Jesus\n\u2013 song, video and performance \u2013 is\na sight to behold, monochrome suits\nand scantily clad ladies and all. Plus,\non a recent appearance on CD:UK,\nManson\u2019s make-up made the under-tens in the audience cry. The old\ndog\u2019s still got it.\nAnna Novitzky\nThe Kaiser Chiefs\nI Predict A Riot\n(Drowned In Sound Recordings)\nHIIII\nMarilyn Manson\nPersonal Jesus\n(Interscope)\nHHHHI\nSINGLE REVIEWS\nEastern Lane are definitely a singles\nband. A couple of bland EPs were\nfollowed up by a decidedly mediocre debut album, Shades Of Black.\nBut then out of nowhere came Feed\nMy Addiction and Saffron, two taut,\ntight and, more importantly, fantastic rock songs.\nNow comes the brilliantly titled\nI Said Pig On Friday. Some would\nsay it\u2019s a dark tale of local custom from their worrying League\nOf Gentlemen-esque home town,\nBerwick-upon-Tweed. Personally I\nprefer describing it as a glorious\nslice of storming indie-disco-rock.\nIt\u2019s another weapon in the growing\narsenal of the budding guitar-music-you-can-dance-to scene.\nI Said Pig On Friday is by no\nmeans as perfect as its title. A kinder\nreviewer might describe the main\nriff as \u201cinfectious\u201d, but I would say\n\u201crepetitive\u201d, or even \u201cfor God\u2019s sake\npeople it\u2019s only two notes played\nover and over and over again\u201d. And\nthe bizarre a capella bit sounds wor-ryingly, um, inbred. There\u2019s a good\nchorus though, and it\u2019s got one of\nthose cool endings, you know, where\nit just... stops. Listen out for it at\nyour local indie disco, and get on the\ndance floor.\nJames Millen\nAlternative Music Society President\nWhere did The Departure spring\nfrom?

That\nmeant any chance of success\nin rifle leagues was dramatically reduced. Then they had a\nflood at their range, meaning\nthat they couldn\u2019t start shooting for the first two weeks.\nIn addition, some guns were\ndamaged in the process.\nHowever, after a bad start,\nthings started looking up. A\nlot of people were interested\nin clay pigeon shooting, which\nmeant that there was a full\nteam to represent Imperial\nat the BUSA championships.\nIn fact, many of the team had\nonly started shooting clay\npigeons earlier in the year.\nThe true disaster this year\ncame with the closing down of\ntherange.Therangehadbeen\nbuilt with the aid of the club in\nthe 1970s, and although it was\nsmall it was also very handy.\nIt will become a storage room\nnow \u2013 what a brilliant use for\nbullet-resistant walls!\nThe club has now relocated\nto the huge Stock Exchange\nRifle Range, which, although\nspacious with many different\ngadgets and a self service bar,\nis unfortunately in Moorgate.\nThe club hopes to subsidise\ntravel to and from the range.\nThey have also armoured a\nsmall cupboard on the South\nKensington campus to store\nshotguns, which will make it\neasier for them to organise\nclay shooting excursions.\nDespite the numerous\nsetbacks, last year still provided some successes. Isao\nMatsumoto was able to win\nhis prone rifle class in the\nNRSA Eley championships.\nLeo Fok came third for the\nthird year in a row in his air\npistol class at the same cham-pionships.

Apart from the\ngrand institution that is the\nSymphony Orchestra, there is\nthe lesser known Sinfonietta\nwho, as well as performing\ntwo concerts every year, also\norganise a tour to foreign\nclimes. Previous tours have\ntaken in Paris, Stockholm and\nBarcelona, but the 2004 tour\nwas to be a three country\nBaltic odyssey including four\nconcerts, two soloists and a\nlot of vodka.\nIt began at a moderately\nrespectable hour on Thursday\nmorning in a crowded terminal at Heathrow, packing double basses in bubble\nwrap and pleading for a more\nflexible luggage allowance.\nBefore long, we were touching down at a snowy Helsinki\nairport for a three day stay\nin Finland. After moving into\nthe youth hostel where we\nwere staying, everyone started exploring Helsinki which,\nfor me, involved a fantastic\nmeal before getting lost on\nthe freezing streets. Helsinki\nis a quiet city; not surprising\nas the Finns have a reputation for being reserved.\nThe next day, many people took the short boat trip\nthrough the frozen harbour to the fortress island\nSuomenlinna. Cue mass\nsnowball fights. Our first concert was that evening in the\nworldfamousTemppelieukion\nkirkko, a church cut out of\na rock, in central Helsinki.\nHere we performed the\nWilliam Tell Overture,\nElgar\u2019s Cello Concerto\nwith soloist Ed Furse, and\nDvorak\u2019s Symphony Number\n8 to an enthusiastic Finnish\naudience.\nOn Sunday morning, after\nthe second concert and a\nnight watching rugby in a\nFrench bar, the orchestra had\nto get their hungover selves\nto the harbour to take the\nearly ferry across the Baltic\nto Tallinn, capital of Estonia.\nThe main entertainments\ncatered for on the ferry were\nballroom dancing and bingo.\nThe Estonian band\u2019s cover of\nMrs Robinson was unforgettable\u2013thinkTheLemonheads\nin 40 years time.\nTallinn is one of the best\npreserved medieval cities in\nEurope, and the ancient walls\nand spires were spectacular.\nHighlights included climbing\nto the top of the largest tower,\npart of the Estonian parlia-ment, and a meal at a medieval restaurant complete with\ncostumed waiters, authentic\ndishes and clay tankards for\nthe beer.\nThe concert the next day\nfeatured Oliver Coates playing the Dvorak Cello concerto\nin another huge church, the\nKaarli Kirik, which was on\na hill overlooking the town.\nAfter this, it was off to the\nBeerhouse for a grand tour\nmeal and much drinking.\nHere, beer was served in\none litre stein glasses. These\ncolossal vessels could have\ncaused some problems, as\nafter the meal it was on to\nour private coaches to drive\nfive hours across the Russian\nborder to St Petersburg.\nFortunately, a pit stop was\ntaken. Crossing the border\nwith over 50 drunken students was an experience to\nsay the least, but with the\nbureaucracy behind us we\narrived in St Petersburg for\nbrunch.\nNothing can prepare you\nfor the sights and sounds of St\nPetersburg. Our hotel was by\nthe River Neva, next to where\nthe Aurora, the famous battleship that signalled the start of\nthe revolution, is moored. A\nshort walk away was the St\nPeter Paul fortress, with its\ninfamous prison and cathedral with its stunning golden\nspire. Over the river was the\ngolden dome of St Isaac\u2019s\ncathedral, the breathtaking\nopulence of the Winter Palace\nand Hermitage museum, and\nalso the must see Russian\nOrthodox \u2018church on spilled\nblood\u2019, built on the spot where\nTsar Alexander II was mur-dered.\nTo explore this city completely would take months.\nRussian food and drink was\ngood and cheap, so many of\nthe orchestra chose to try\ndishes such as caviar, sturgeon or an authentic beef\nstroganoff.\nThe final concert of the tour\nwas to take place in the concert hall of our hotel, attended by an appreciative audience of fellow guests. All that\nwas needed now was an end\nof tour party. This was fuelled\nby beer at 40p a bottle and\ncopious quantities of a clear\nliquid that is very prominent\nin Russia; its name, along\nwith the finer details of the\nnight, escape me. Suffice\nto say there was attempted\nCossack dancing at one point,\nand I still have the bruises.\nThe coaches then took us\nback to Helsinki to catch the\nplane home. Special thanks\nmust go to our conductor Dan\nCapps, chairman Adam Smith\nwho organised this mammoth\ntour, and soloists Ed Furse\nand Oliver Coates.\nThis coming Easter,\nthe orchestra will be off to\nVienna, sometime home to\nMozart and centre of the\nmusical world for centuries,\nand Bratislava, historic capital of Slovakia. Expectations\nof another successful tour\nare high after seeing the pictures of Viennese palaces and\nhearing that beer is 30p a pint\nin Bratislava. Make sure you\ndon\u2019t miss out.\nSinfonietta rehearse every\nMonday evening in the Great\nHall. For further information about joining, visit www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/arts/sinfoni-etta. Our next concert will be\non Tuesday 14 December in\nthe Great Hall. Look out for\nposters nearer the time.\nFrom Russia with love\n9\nSINFONIETTA\nBy Chris Jackson\nRAG Chair\nWelcome to another article\nfrom Imperial College Union\nRAG which I have the honour\nof fronting this year. Following\non from my previous article,\nthis one is a mixture of thanks\nand apologies.\nFirstly, some thanks are\ndue to those who visited us at\nthe Freshers Fair and helped\nus get our fundraising off the\nzero mark with a nice \u00a3108.31\nfor our charities, which are\nthe Mercury Phoenix AIDS\nTrust and Cancer Research\nUK. I know this may not be\nthe world\u2019s biggest amount,\nbut it is a start, and if you feel\nwe should be raising more\nthen get involved and make it\nhappen! The freshers meet-ing, for anyone who wants\nto find out more (or didn\u2019t\nget round to seeing us at the\nfair), will be on Thursday 21\nOctober at midday in dBs. I\nlook forward to seeing some\nof you there.\nThe mention of Freshers\nFair brings me onto the apologies section. Some might\nthink that an apology to\nthe City and Guilds College\nUnion is in the offing for the\n\u2018borrowing\u2019 of their mascot\nSpanner. Others might think\nI am about to say sorry to\nthe poor Union staff on the\nradios who were reportedly\ntrying to locate it, or to those\nwho couldn\u2019t get more pressing problems sorted out due\nto the radios being clogged\nup as people searched for\nthe aforementioned piece of\nbrass. But no, I am apologis-ing to none of these people,\nand only to the student population in general for not managing to extort more than \u00a310\nout of City and Guilds College\nUnion President John Collins\nfor Spanner\u2019s safe return.\nSuch derogatory payments to\nRAG charities (from a former\nRAG treasurer no less) must\nbe dealt with, so watch out\nCGCU, we\u2019ll be back.\nThe other apology must\ngo to those who were hoping to join the pub crawl that\nwas mentioned previously\nin these hallowed pages.\nSadly, due to a mistake by the\nMetropolitan Police relating\nto collecting licences, this has\nhad to be postponed. With a\nbit of luck and no more prob-lems, it should be back before\nChristmas. Watch this space!\nOther events in the offing include something for\nChildren In Need, which this\nyear is on 19 November, and\nthe World AIDS Day mega-raid on 27 November. This\nis the perfect chance for all\nof you who asked questions\nlike \u201cAre you the people who\nrun around doing crazy stuff\nfor charity?\u201d to do just that.\nKeep the date free; details\nwill follow.\nFinally, Dave (Felix editor)\nseems to think it is a good\nplan for RAG to feature regularly in this publication, so\nyou have the privilege of looking forward to some more of\nmy inane bumblings in the\nfuture whenever I feel I have\nsomething to tell you about.\nIn the meantime, keep an eye\non the RAG website, www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/rag, for any\nmore minor updates.\nRAG\nThanks and apologies from RAG\nOliver\nCoates plays\nthe Dvorak\nCello Concerto with\nImperial\nCollege\nSinfonietta\nThe \u2018church\non spilled\nblood\u2019, St\nPetersburg\nSpanner stolen: Chris (right) shows off the City and Guilds mascot\nDo you want thousands of readers to know all about your club or society?

In a couple of weeks,\nthe clocks go back and that journey\nhome suddenly takes place in the\ndark. At these times, it is important\nto be aware of personal and possession safety issues. Here are some\nfacts, figures and safety tips to help\nyou during your time at Imperial.\nAround one third of students\nbecome victims of crime while at\nuniversity. Latest Home Office figures have revealed that domestic\nbreak-ins rose by 7.9% over the past\nyear and that 11.8% of students in\nprivate accommodation experienced\ndomestic burglary.\nStreet criminals range from your\nArtful Dodger to your Bill Sykes.\nMuggers will target your wallet and\nyour mobile phone, while more violent types might want to physically\nharm you.\nOver 100,000 bicycles are reported\nstolen every year. They are a popular target with thieves because they\ncan easily be sold.\nBelow you\u2019ll find the Union Advice\nService\u2019s top ten tips for protecting yourself, your home and your\nwheels:\n\u25cf Lock your bedroom door, even if\nyou\u2019re only going to the kitchen or\nbathroom.\n\u25cf Check doors and windows are\nlocked at night or when going out\n\u2013 don\u2019t assume someone else will\ndo it.\n\u25cf Make a list of your personal prop-erty, including the serial number\nand descriptions. Use an ultraviolet\npen to mark electrical and other\nitems with your Imperial College\naddress, followed by your identification number on your student card.\nAlternatively, mark property with\nyour parents\u2019 postcode. Not only will\nthis make it easier to trace stolen\nproperty but it can help police gain\nevidence about offenders.\n\u25cf Think ahead. Don\u2019t walk home\nalone late at night \u2013 arrange in\nadvance to stay with a trusted friend\nor pre-book a taxi.\n\u25cf Never leave drinks unattended\nin pubs or clubs. When you go to\nthe toilet, ask your friends to keep\nan eye on your drink. Try to have\nyour drinks in bottles and cover the\ntop with your thumb when walking\naround. Men\u2019s drinks get spiked too.\nIf you suspect your drink has been\nspiked, contact a member of staff or\ntell a trusted friend.\n\u25cf Don\u2019t show off your cash, mobile\nphone or laptop, or leave them lying\naround. Never leave your bag, wallet\nor purse unattended, and don\u2019t carry\nyour chequebook and card together.\nTake out protection for your credit\ncards and note all your card details\nat home, so you can cancel them\nquickly if they\u2019re stolen.\n\u25cf Try to go to the cash point in daylight if possible. Be aware of people\nstanding too close to you, and always\nconceal your PIN. If it\u2019s dark, go with\na friend if you can and don\u2019t check\nyour money in full view.\n\u25cf Always lock doors, windows, the\nboot and sunroof when leaving your\ncar, even if it\u2019s only for a minute.\n\u25cf Never leave belongings in a car\n\u2013 even an old coat could tempt a thief\nthat there might be something valuable in the pockets. If you have to\nleave anything, lock it in the boot.\n\u25cf Keep cars topped up with petrol\nand park in busy, well-lit areas.\nRemember, the Union Advice\nService give out personal safety\nalarms to students for free.\nFor further advice on all personal\nsafety issues, please contact the\nStudent Adviser, Nigel Cooke, on 020\n7594 8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.\n\u25cf The Student Adviser will be\nin the JCR today from 11am\nuntil 3pm to answer your questions and give out information,\npersonal attack alarms and\ncondoms.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nWhat are more important?\nDoughnuts or votes?\nThe case for doughnuts:\nDoughnuts are generally quite\nnice. The texture of a doughnut is\na work of art that tickles the fancy\nof the taste buds of many of the\ngreat and good. Doughnuts, when\nthey have fillings, provide a sensuous gastronomical experience. They\nare great cold and fantastic hot, but\nwhatever you do, don\u2019t put them\nin the microwave (the filling heats\nmuch, much, faster than the dough\nand you\u2019ll burn your tongue). You\ncan buy a packet of five doughnuts\nfrom Tesco for the price of \u00a31.\nThe case for votes:\nVotes are power. Votes in Union\nelections help ensure that the Union\nis representative of your views.\nVoting shows the College that you\nbelieve in the principle of student\nrepresentation (even if you just vote\n\u2018New Election\u2019 because you think\nthe candidates are all rubbish).\nMore votes means that your department has more reason to listen to\nyour views when making changes\nto courses and facilities that affect\nyou.\nWhat\u2019s more, this year, Imperial\nCollege Union is trialling \u2018Mustafa\u2019s\nclub and society bonus funding\nbonanza\u2019. It\u2019s very simple. When you\ncast your vote, you get to nominate\na Union club or society to receive an\nextra 25p of funding to their budget.\nLet\u2019s put that in perspective. Four\nvotes give your club \u00a31. That\u2019s five\nTesco doughnuts for the price of\nfour votes. Bonus. No brain-er, any-one?\nOK, let\u2019s cut to the chase. From\ntoday until the end of the weekend,\nyou can vote online for members of\nUnion Council, Committees, ULU\nCouncil and various faculty and\ndepartmental vacancies, at www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/vote. Do it now. Get\nyour doughnuts.\nTrust\nElected student officers hold a position of trust. What is trust? Trust\nis not a tangible entity. It\u2019s not a\ncommodity we can buy or sell. It\u2019s\neasy to destroy but very difficult to\nrebuild.\nUnionOfficersare\u201ctrustees\u201dunder\nEnglish charity law. Nevertheless,\ntrust is more deep-rooted than that.\nAs elected officers, we have to operate on a principle of trust. You have\nto believe that we hold your best\ninterest interests at heart. You have\nto have faith in us to represent your\nviews accurately and to the best of\nour ability. You have to trust us to do\n\u2018the right thing\u2019 \u2013 when no-one actually knows what \u2018the right thing\u2019 is,\nother than that their idea is different\nto everyone else\u2019s.\nAt the end of the day you have to\nbelieve, without any doubt, that your\nelected representatives will do their\nbest \u2013 and do what they believe to\nbe \u2018the right thing\u2019 to serve your\ninterests. If you don\u2019t have such\nfaith in election candidates, vote\n\u2018New Election\u2019. If you do have such\nfaith then give them a chance to\nprove themselves. What appears to\nbe \u2018wrong\u2019 may turn out to be \u2018right\u2019\nin the end.\nResignation?\nYou may have heard that I\u2019m quit-ting. I\u2019m not a quitter. I was elected to a job. I shall see it through\nbecause I know I\u2019m the best person\nto see it through, even if the pressure sometimes gets a bit much.\nEnd of story. This week\u2019s other news\nstories are more interesting and\nimportant.\nThis week\u2019s competition\nIf a Union club or society gets a real-ly, really huge amount of votes cast\nin the elections (I\u2019m not sure what\n\u2018huge\u2019 means yet since it\u2019ll depend\non turnout), then they\u2019ll get a prize.\nI\u2019m not sure what the prize will be\nyet, but it might involve doughnuts.\nIf you\u2019re lucky.\nBike Sheds, bike sheds, bike sheds.\nThey\u2019ve become urban legends\nin some schools (and perhaps in\nrevered institutes of higher educa-tion), where they are renowned for\nexploratory sexual encounters or\nthe illicit abuse of drugs.\nBut why am I talking about them?\nWell, cyclists\u2019 parking facilities have\noccupied quite a lot of my time\nover the summer. The President\nhad received numerous complaints\nregarding the new Faculty Building\nbike store (that\u2019s in the blue Lego\ncube, for the uninitiated) and the\nremoval of cycle racks around the\ncampus. On a long journey back\nfrom Birmingham, he asked me if\nI cycled, to which I foolishly replied\nthat I had been known to, and the\nrest, as they say, is history.\nImperial College has traditionally\nbeen the crime hot-spot of South\nKensington, thanks to the high incidence of bike theft and vandalism,\nso in response to this, a few years\nago, the Union lobbied College for\nsecure cycle parking facilities. The\noriginal plan was to put the facility\nunder the walkway, but when they\nstarted to draw up plans for the\nFaculty Building, that was seen as a\nbetter location.\nBack in May, when the Building\nhad been completed, a College\nnotice was sent out informing all\ncyclists who wanted to use the new\nstore to register their bikes with\nCollege Security. This was necessary for two reasons: access to the\nstore is by swipe card only, so they\nneed to know who should be allowed\nin there, and in the case where bikes\nare stolen on campus, the crime is a\nlot easier to follow up if the cyclist\nhas registered.\nThere were teething problems\nwith the project, but Estates staff\nhave promised to improve the conditions in the bike store.\nIn addition to the creation of the\nnew facility, there has been a strategy of concentrating cycle parking\nfacilities in certain key locations\nacross the campus, where visibility and security are good. Another\nimprovement is the new covered\nracks in Beit Quad, secured through\nfunding from Transport for London.\nOne of the most exciting developments is an open meeting to which\nI would like to invite all interested\nparties, which will also be attended\nby the Assistant Director of Estates,\nto discuss cyclists\u2019 concerns. It will\nbe held on Wednesday 20 October at\n5pm in the Read Lecture Theatre.\nI have also set up a mailing list\nfor people to stay abreast of the\nlatest developments. To subscribe,\nsend an email to bike-users-subscribe@imperial.ac.uk. One of\nthe things I shall be aiming to do in\nthe future is set up a users\u2019 group\nthat can discuss cycle rack issues\non a regular basis and provide feedback to Estates, who will hopefully\nbe in a position to improve things.\nIf you have any views on the topic,\nplease don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch.\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nUNCLE SAM\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\n\n"

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nFarringdon is a funny place at night\nat the weekends. Around the time\nof the last tube, the streets near\nthe station are awash with people.\nWhilst the majority will be on their\nway to giant superclub Fabric (see\nSize Matters, right), a good proportion will be heading to one of the\ncity\u2019s oldest and most popular clubs,\nTurnmills.\nThe club has a fair amount of history attached to it \u2013 it was the first\nplace in the UK to hold a 24 hour\nentertainment licence, the birthplace of gay hard house pioneering\nclub Trade, and it has been owned\nby DJ Tall Paul (who also runs Duty\nFree Records from there) for more\nthan 15 years.\nInside, the club is deceptively\nlarge, vaguely L-shaped, with low\nceilings. On some nights, it can support up to four different rooms of\ndifferent music. Taking a wander\naround, you\u2019ll discover that there\nare plenty of nooks and crannies to\nlose yourself in. The d\u00e9cor is colourful and abundant, with drapes,\nold movie posters, strangely shaped\nrails and nobbly divisions. There are\nseveral seated areas, and it\u2019s usually not too hard to find a place to\nsit when you need a breather. The\nsound systems are huge, and even if\nthey\u2019re not the best around they are\npunchy and do the job well.\nTonight I went to check out The\nGallery, Turnmills\u2019 resident Friday\nnight. With a large base of mem-bers, tons of regulars and a grand\nreputation, it\u2019s easy to see why this\nis normally a rammed session, and\nthat\u2019s without even mentioning the\nline-ups. Which I\u2019m about to do.\nPaul Oakenfold played here the\nprevious week, Armin van Buuren\nthe week before that. This month\nFergie and Tall Paul are playing too,\nso you can see this is a good place\nto come to check out big names.\nTonight, those names were Timo\nMaas and Dave Seaman, and by the\ntime I had arrived Timo was already\nplaying.\nThe self-styled German is a producer as well as a DJ, and before he\nmade it big he used to sell mobile\nphones. Once he got into the music\nscene, he became one of the busiest men in the industry. Fans of\nthe music will remember his classic\nproggy Ubik. He\u2019s remixed many\nbig artists, including Kelis, Placebo,\nGarbage and Fatboy Slim, and that\nAzzido Da Bass track a couple of\nyears ago. The compilations Music\nfor the Maases, collections of remixes plus some of his own tracks,\nhave been successful accross two\nvolumes.\nThere\u2019s only one way to describe\nthe was Timo Maas plays \u2013 wet\nand hard. Driven by his desire to\nmake music away from the standard \u201ccheesy shit\u201d, he takes good\nquality dance music and throws it\nabout to whip up a frenzy on the\ndancefloor. His music is bouncy and\nfun yet to the point and smart. He\u2019s\nnot afraid to play popular or commercial music either \u2013 he played\nthree Prodigy tracks. After a good\nfew hours on the dancefloor, getting\ndown to Timo\u2019s blend of what some\npeople call \u2018techno pop\u2019, I came to\nappreciate the air conditioning.\nWhilst in some corners of the club\nyou might feel a bit of an icy blast,\nwhen you\u2019re in the thick of it you\u2019ll\nbe grateful for the circulating air,\nkeeping sweat to a minimum.\nNext up, it was the turn of progressive DJ Dave Seaman on the decks.\nA former DJM champion and past\neditor of Mixmag, Seaman has been\naround for a while. As well as breaking such prolific artists as Sasha,\nDigweed and Full Intention via his\nmate\u2019s record label, Stress, he\u2019s a\npopular remixer and has a string\nof successful mix CDs to his name,\nincluding Global Underground and\nRenaissance titles. All in all, this guy\nreally knows where it\u2019s at in terms\nof dance music.\nHis mixing is, as you\u2019d expect,\nsuperb. Heavy, harmonic basslines\nand esoteric vocals and samples are\nmixed together with great musicality and dexterity. There was never\nany question of the dancefloor not\nbeing full; at times I find this place\na wee bit claustrophobic, getting\nbumped around by too many shoulders and elbows. For the most part,\nthough, this isn\u2019t really an issue, so\nlong as you have the right attitude\nand acknowledge that everyone is\nthere to dance. You\u2019re going to be\nsquashed, people will push past you,\nbits of bodies will poke into yours.\nIf you have personal space issues it\nmight get a tad wearing when that\nsweaty monkey bumps your arse\non every beat of a snare. It\u2019s just as\neasy and a lot better to just shrug\nit off though \u2013 be tactile, accept\nthat clubbing is a contact sport, and\nbecome absorbed in the crowd.\nIt is a lot easier to tolerate a\npacked dancefloor when a lot of your\nfellow revellers are attractive members of the opposite sex. Luckily,\nin Turnmills, there\u2019s no shortage.\nThe clientele are stylish and sexy,\nand the way they dress matches\nthe decor (or possibly the other way\naround). They\u2019re friendly, up for it,\nand not afraid to check out what\nother talent is around. If you\u2019re looking for a place to go clubbing, with\nproper, decent dance music, and a\nchance of pulling too (which is surprisingly easy \u2013 loud music means\nno small talk), Turnmills is ideal.\nLooking around the place throughout the night, you\u2019ll see plenty of\nface sucking going on.\nAll in all, The Gallery is a consistently good night out, well worth the\nmoney, and with the possibility of a\nlengthy queue if there\u2019s a particularly famous DJ on.\nSimon Clark\nWet and hard, Seaman too\n\u2018Percussive wet funk\u2019 from German DJ Timo Maas and progressive\nhouse from stalwart Dave Seaman on show at The Gallery\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nCLUB REVIEW\nHere\u2019s an unusual situation: myself\nand my (male) housemate sitting in\nthe living room discussing what to\nwear for the night out, while asking\nour other (also male) housemate if\nhe\u2019s got any clothes we can borrow.\nNot something that happens every-day, if ever. Had we had our brains\nmessed with by aliens? No. We were\ngoing to Trash.\nUsually I wouldn\u2019t give a club with\na dress code a second glance, feeling happily safe in the knowledge\nthat wearing trainers is going to\nsave me from whatever godforsaken trendy West End club I\u2019m\nbeing enticed to go to. But this is\ndifferent. It may be a dress code,\nbut it is comfortably without limits\nor standards. Allow me to explain:\nAccording to their website, Trash\nwant you to \u201cmake an effort\u201d, with\nabsolutely no explanation as to\nwhat that means. The first time I\never went there I was turned away,\nbut this time I had help (we were\non the guest list) so we weren\u2019t too\nworried, opting in the end for the\nusual festival t-shirt and a typical\nindie stripped t-shirt.\nEntering the club, there\u2019s a dance\nfloor to the left with an award-win-ning sound system that sounds\nbreathtaking. To the right is a bar\nand a very nice chill-out area with\ncouches and tables. The founder of\nThe End, Mr C, did an excellent job\nof making the venue enjoyable not\nonly to those who want to dance,\nbut also to those who just want to sit\nin a corner somewhere and enjoy\nthe music. The headline DJ tonight\nwas called Annie, a Norwegian girl\nwho plays a very good mix of happy\nelectric pop. She wasn\u2019t on for more\nthan an hour, being replaced by\nresident DJs playing a wider variety of music, including the likes\nof J5 and Dead Prez in the chill-out room, and dance/techno mixes\non the dance floor. By now, the\nplace had started to pick up and the\ndance floor was filled with happy\nsmiling people. If you\u2019re still wondering about the dress code, most\npeople were dressed stereotypically\nindie, with a few goths and punks\nwandering about.\nTrash is a very good night out and\nhighly recommended, even if you\ndo have to go through the hassle\nof finding something to wear. The\ncrowd are nice, with all manner of\npeople and ages showing up. It\u2019s\na great place to go if you want to\ndance, or just be a wallflower and\nenjoy the music.\nOlle \u00c5kesson\nTrash\nThe End, West Central Street\n\u00a35\nHHHHI\nNordic beauty Annie\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 14 October 2004 19\nSize\nmatters\nLondon has some huge\nvenues.

Usually there\u2019s\ndrum and bass in the second room,\nwhich means many many chavs.\nStill, sometimes it\u2019s fun to don a fake\nBurberry cap and hoody and blend\nin.

    "content": "Science science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 14 October 2004 5\nDo you like sushi? Imperial\nCollege scientists have discovered that the puffer fish\n(\u2018fugu\u2019), a Japanese delicacy\nknown for its deadly after-taste, may be able to reduce\nthe spreading of cancerous\ncells, otherwise known as\nmetastasis.\nWhen metastasis occurs,\ntreatment becomes difficult\nand so new ways to diagnose the potential metastatic\ntumour and suppress it are\nneeded. The puffer fish produces a toxin called tetrodotoxin (TTX), which can\nbe deadly since it blocks the\nactivity of certain ion chan-nels, normally found in nerve\nand muscle cell membranes.\nIt is so deadly that only the\nmost skilled (and licensed)\nJapanese chefs can prepare\nthe dish.\nSo why is this toxin important in cancer research? The\nImperial group is a part of the\nBiological Sciences depart-ment. Led by Professor\nMustafa Djamgoz, the team\nof PhD and post-doc scientists were the first to discover that the ability of prostate and breast tumours to\nmetastasise involved the\nexpression of TTX-sensitive\nion channels. In other words,\nthey found that aggressive\ntumours seem to become\nexcitable, rather like nerves\nand muscles. These were\nidentified as voltage-gated\nsodium channels (VGSCs)\nand were expressed specifically in prostate and breast\ncancer cells that had the ability to metastasise.\nProstate cancer affects\n50% of men by the age of 50.\nTreatment includes drastic\nsurgery which can result in\nextreme functional problems.\nBreast cancer, although more\neasily detectable, affects one\nin nine women, both young\nand old. In many cases, the\nprimary tumour is not the\nkiller, so the ability to distinguish early whether or\nnot a tumour will metasta-sise would save many men\nand women from devastating\nsurgery. The expression of\nVGSCs in prostate and breast\ncancer may be a novel way of\ndetecting if the tumour will\nmetastasise.\nDespite on-going phase II\nclinical trials of the use of\nTTX for treating pain and\nheroin addiction, the prospect of utilising TTX for prevention (or cure) of cancer\nmetastasis remains difficult.\nIn the meantime, recent\nadvances by the Imperial\ngroup have been in the development of a novel antibody\nthat exploits the fact that it\nis the embryonic form of the\nsodium channels that have\nan increased response during cancer progression. In\nbreast cancer, this embryi-onic ion channel differs from\nthe adult form by 7 amino\nacids and so would allow the\nantibody enough specificity\nto \u2018lock\u2019 onto and block the\nchannel.\nIn the same way that TTX\nblocked the channel and\nreduced metastatic behav-iour, it is hoped that the antibody will do the same.\nScott Fraser, a post-doc-toral scientist in the group,\ntold Felix: \u201cThere is the possibility that the antibody will\nbe used for early and definitive diagnosis and therapy of\nbreast cancer metastasis.\u201d\nHeadofthegroup,Professor\nDjamgoz, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s a\ngood old channel and it is a\nviable target for treatment of\nmetastatic disease. The antibody works as a \u2018magic bullet\u2019 which can either deliver\ndrugs directly to the tumour\ncell or itself become the channel blocker.\u201d\nHowever, it seems that utilising the same approach for\nthe prostate cancer VGSC\nwill be more difficult due to\nthe channel sequence differing by only one amino acid.\nProfessor Djamgoz concluded by saying: \u201cI am still\n(also) very optimistic for the\nuse of natural toxins in the\ntherapy of metastatic dis-ease. After all, botulinum\ntoxin (\u201cbotox\u201d) is equally\nlethal but works because it\nso specific and its dose and\nlocality of application can be\ncontrolled\u201d.\nThe group\u2019s research is\nwell-funded by a number of\norganisations, including the\nMedical Research Council,\nCancer Research UK, the\nWellcome Trust and the\nBBSRC. A series of public\nrelations exercises also led\nto the establishment of a\nregistered charity (the Pro\nCancer Research Fund, or\nPCRF) that supports the\nneuroscience approach to\nfinding novel solutions to the\nmost common cancers in the\nworld. The charity also raises\nmoney by organising various\nsocial and sporting events\nthrough the PCRF Support\nGroup and volunteers.\nl If you would like to\nknow more about the\nresearch or support\nthe PCRF, you can visit\nwww.prostatecrf.org (or\nwww.bio.ic.ac.uk/staff/\nmbad) or donate directly\nthrough www.justgiving.\ncom\nImperial innovation in cancer research\nImperial College stands at the cutting edge of cancer research. This week Emma Williams\ninvestigates some recent innovations and talks to the scientists now in the front line\nPuffer fish produce terodotoxin (TTX), a neurotoxin which blocks ion channels associated,\naccording to researchers, with the spreading (or \u2018metastasis\u2019) of cancer tumours\n\u201cThere is a\npossibility that the\nantibody will be\nused for early and\ndefinitive diagnosis and therapy\nof breast cancer\nmetastasis\u201d\nBy Kate Wighton\nScience Communication\nStill searching for drinkable decaffeinated coffee?\nBacteria may be the answer.\nIn a study to be published\nin the Journal of the America\nChemical Society, scientists\nhave claimed to have engineered bacteria to produce a\nmolecule responsible for the\nbreakdown of caffeine. This\nmolecule could be introduced\ninto coffee plants to create\ndecaffeinated plants, resulting in good-tasting, naturally\ndecaffeinated coffee.\nIn coffee plants, caffeine\nis produced very quickly but\nbroken down very slowly,\nhence the high caffeine con-tent. This slow breakdown is\ndue to a slow-acting decaffeinating enzyme. The team\nat Emory University, Georgia\nengineered bacteria to produce a faster version of this\ndecaffeinating enzyme, which\ncan then be reintroduced into\ncoffee plants, enabling the\nplants to rapidly break down\ncaffeine.\nChemists Justin Gallivan\nand Shawn Desai, who are\nbehind the work, essentially\nused bacteria as miniature\nchemical reactors.\nIn this case, the bacteria\nwere engineered to depend\non theophylline, the product of caffeine breakdown.\nHowever, the bacteria would\nnot make the theophylline\nmolecules under normal con-ditions. This problem was\novercome by making the bacteria dependent upon theophylline for survival.\nTo isolate the enzyme\nresponsible for converting\nthe caffeine to theophylline (the product of caffeine\nbreakdown), DNA thought to\ncode for the decaffeinating\nenzyme was then introduced\ninto the bacteria.\nTo ensure that the bacteria\nneeded this enzyme for sur-vival, the chemists designed\na \u2018survival switch\u2019. This\nswitch recognised theophylline and turned on a protein\nthat would give the bacteria antibiotic resistance.\nHowever, only caffeine was\nmade available to the bac-teria. As Gallivan explained,\n\u201cthey now need the breakdown product (theophylline)\nof the enzyme for survival,\nbut they can\u2019t do much with\ncaffeine\u201d.\nHenceexposingthebacteria\nto the antibiotic would force\nthem to rely on the enzyme\nto perform the decaffeinating\nreaction, produce theophyl-line, and in turn switch on\nthe antibiotic resistance and\nsurvive.\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\nwe will know that all of the\nsurviving bacteria have\n\u2018learned\u2019 to break down caffeine to theophylline, and\nthus contain the enzyme that\nwe\u2019re interested in,\u201d says\nGallivan.\nThe fact that the bacteria\nnow need theophylline for\nsurvival may increase the\nenzymes\u2019 efficiency. \u201cWe hope\nto use this process, known\nas directed evolution, to help\nspeed up the enzyme to break\ndown coffee faster,\u201d Gallivan\nsays.\nThe more efficient enzyme\ncould then be introduced back\ninto coffee plants, and voila:\ndecaffeinated coffee straight\nfrom the plant.\nThe research is still in its\nearly stages. Interestingly,\nwhether the alteration of the\nrate of caffeine breakdown\nwould have any physiological\neffect on the plant was not\nmentioned.\nHowever, even if this work\ndoes lead to good decaffeinated coffee, there is still an\nage-old question that this\nresearch cannot answer:\nwhat is the point in drinking\ncoffee if you don\u2019t get the caffeine kick?\nl Further reading:\nwww.emory.edu\nDirected bacterial evolution to help develop decaf coffee\nDecaf coffee: bacterial evolution could give it more flavour\n\u201cAt the end of the\nday, we will know\nthat all of the surviving bacteria have\n\u2018learned\u2019 to break\ndown caffeine\u201d\n\n"

The club fenced at\na high profile event entitled\n\u2018What Price Gold? Should\nLondon Persist in its Bid\nto Hold the 2012 Olympic\nGames\u2019, held at the Imperial\nCollege Tanaka Business\nSchool for its opening. There\nwas also success in the BUSA\nindividuals\u2019 competition\nand the University College\nInternational Competition.\nThis summer, the fencing\nclub managed to take a small\nteam to Hong Kong. They\nwere invited and competed\nin the Hong Kong University\nof Science and Technology\nInternational Competition.\nThey were the only team\nfrom Europe and the west \u2013\neveryone else had come from\nuniversities in Hong Kong,\nMacau and Singapore. The\nsmall squad of five Imperial\nstudents and one from SOAS\ndecided to compete in as\nmany events as possible.\nThe team arrived in Hong\nKong a week before the competition began. This enabled\nthem to see all the major\nsights of the country, from\nthe Peak, the highest place\non Hong Kong, to the world\u2019s\nbiggest bronze Buddha. They\nwent around all the major\nmuseums as well as bars,\nclubs, restaurants and shops.\nThe first day of the competition saw individual matches\ntake place. Everyone was\ndoing both weapons, with\nexception of Fabian and Eric\nwho decided to concentrate\non ep\u00e9e. Admittedly, most of\nthe team were not amazingly\nexperienced, having only\nbeen fencing for a year. This\nexplains why no one brought\nhome any medals, although\nstar fencer and president,\nEric Lai, came eighth in ep\u00e9e.\nHowever, everyone enjoyed\nthe challenge.\nThat night, some of the\nImperial team went out par-tying, arriving home at 4am,\ngiving them only four hours\u2019\nsleep before the next day\u2019s\nfencing match. However, they\nkept on doing well, only nar-rowingly losing the foil team\nmatch and winning the ep\u00e9e\nteam match. By the time of\nthe second ep\u00e9e match, Eric\nhad arrived, which got the\nteam\u2019s spirits up. Despite all\ntheir efforts though, they were\ndefeated by much stronger\nopposition.\nAttheendofallthematches,\nalthough the Imperial team\ndidn\u2019t win any medals, they\nstill received a small gift for\nturning up.

He also\nownsTampaBayBuccaneers,\nwho, although they are currently at the bottom of their\nrespective American league\ntable, have had their profitable moments.\nThe attack\nIn order for Glazer and his\ntwo sons to own Manchester\nUnited, they need to over-home four major hurdles\nand about 100 small ones.\nGlazer has yet to offer an\nunrefusable premium to the\nclub\u2019s two biggest sharehold-ers, JP McManus and John\nMagnier, in order to obtain\ntheir share.\nThe chances that McManus\nand Magnier will bow to the\ntentative offers made by\nGlazer, including a premium\nthat could see them gain a\n\u00a317m profit, are currently\nvery slim. The pair are no\nstrangers to the risks associated with misplacing their\ninvestments, especially as\nthey themselves made their\nmillions through sports bet-ting.\nHowever, Glazer has shown\nhimself to be clearly ahead of\nthe mark by opting for backing from the highly respected\nAmerican investment bank,\nJP Morgan. The current 300\npence per share offer would\nvalue the club at over \u00a3780m,\nbut this is likely to rise significantly as McManus and\nMagnier hesitate on the offer\nand demand a higher price.\nIf Glazer can succumb to the\npair\u2019s needs, his next challenge would be to evade the\nthorny arms of Shareholders\nUnited, a commitee set up\nto ensure that control of the\nclub stays with its fans and\nnot with wealthy individuals\nor big businesses.\nNext, Glazer will have to\nwrestle with the Manchester\nEducation Committee, whose\ninvasion of the pitch during\nUnited\u2019s latest game showed\ntheir resentment of Glazer\u2019s\nmove and their strength in\nnumbers. It is worth pointing\nout that it was these same\ncommitees and alliances\nthat battled against Rupert\nMurdoch succesfully almost\nsix years ago.\nHaving steered his way\npast all that, Glazer will most\nprobably come head to head\nwith Keith Harris, chairman of Seymour Pierce, the\nLondon based investment\nbank that has issues over\n\u00a3450m in equity.\nIf Glazer reaches this stage,\na fierce battle will no doubt\nensue, and both men currently have a 50\u201350 chance of\nowning the club. The reader\nmay at this point be thinking\n\u201cGood luck Glazer, you fool\u201d,\nbut it is worth considering\nthat he has a massive advantage that could be the turning\npoint in this affair. Whether\nit was advance planning or\njust luck, only he knows, but\nGlazer has already secured a\n19% stake in the club through\nhis family\u2019s equity holdings.\nThe payoff\nIt is almost certain that\nif Glazer were to own\nManchester United, his first\nmove would be to regain the\nlosses incurred as a result\nof the takeover, which are\nexpected to run into millions.\nBut what will be his methodology in balancing his books?\nUnited fans, as much as\nyou may enjoy reading these\narticles, should look away\nnow to avoid a panic attack.\nGlazer will, like any other\nsmart investor, recoup his\nlosses by exploiting your passion of watching your favourite club play. Ticket prices\nfor home matches at Old\nTrafford could increase by up\nto \u00a315 and, combined with the\nproposed increase in seating,\ncould easily generate enogh\nrevenue in one year to make\nGlazer\u2019s takeover well worth\nit.\nYour intervention\nIt may seem far fetched, but\nthe reader could be the\none deciding the face of the\nclub in just over four years.\nAlthough I promote \u2018get\nrich quick\u2019 schemes heavily,\nthis time I will restrain myself\nand inform you of another\ngenuine way to make real\nmoney.\nI received an email just a\nfew days ago inviting me to an\n\u2018Entrepreneurs\u2019 Challenge\u2019.\nIt started off: \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever\nsaid to someone that you\u2019ve\ngot this really good idea that\u2019s\ngoing to pay for that Ferrari\n[Scaglietti, obviously], then\nhere is the place to prove it.\u201d\nThe Entrepreneurs\u2019\nChallenge, as might be obvious from it\u2019s name, is for those\nwho have an innovation that\nthey are prepared to present\nto a panel of judges. And the\nreward? Apart from listening\nto inspiring speeches by successful entrepreneurs, there\nare opportunities to compete\nin a range of competitions\nwith prizes ranging from\n\u00a3250 to \u00a325,000. That won\u2019t be\nenough to affect Manchester\nUnited, although receiving\nadvice from expert consultants and raising investment\ncapital to make your idea a\nreality, like many have done\nin the past, will.\nForget supporting Man Utd.

Each year, over\n\u00a355,000 worth of prizes are\nawarded to students. Come\nalong to our launch party on\nTuesday 19 October and find\nout how you can enter and\nhave the opportunity to win\n\u00a325,000!\nThe launch party is your\nopportunity to learn how\nyou can get involved. Piers\nRobinson, Student Business\nMentor, will be explaining\nhow you can enter and win\none of the many prizes. Be\ninspired by successful entrepreneur Dan Germain, one\nof the founders at Innocent\ndrinks, plus hear from previous winners what they gained\nfrom entering the competi-tion. The Challenge organisers will also be on hand to\nanswer to any questions at a\nnetworking and drinks session held afterwards at the\nTanaka Business School.\nThe Challenge is open to\nall Imperial College students,\nundergraduate and post-graduate, and is run by the\nEntrepreneurship Centre in\nthe Tanaka Business School.\nYou do not need to have prior\nbusiness or commercial\nexperience to enter. Previous\nwinners have come from\na variety of departments,\nsuch as Physics, Medicine,\nMechanical Engineering and\nBiological Sciences.\nThe \u2018Ideas Challenge\u2019, the\nfirst part of the competition,\nruns in the autumn term and\nasks for a 2\u20133 page summary\nof a business idea. Ten \u00a31,000\nprizes and ten \u00a3250 prizes will\nbe awarded to the winners at\nthis stage.

This may\nhave offended the band mem-bers. According to witnesses,\nMr Flint and two of his colleagues then jumped down off\nthe stage and began to punch\nthe student, who was left with\ncuts and bruises to the head\nand face.\nA friend who stepped in\nto help the student was also\nattacked. The pair were then\nforcibly removed from the\nvenue by Mr Flint\u2019s body-guards, and the band continued to play. Later that night,\npolice officers questioned\nthe band members and the\nstudent, who eventually\ndecided not to press charges.\nAccording to a senior Union\nsource, the police were prepared to make arrests on\nthe scene for actual bodily\nharm.\nIt has been suggested that\nthe student\u2019s actions immediately prior to the incident may\nhave provoked the attack.\nHowever, a close friend of his\ntold Felix: \u201cKnowing the guy,\nI can\u2019t imagine he would have\nsaid anything offensive to\nthe band.\u201d\nThe band denied any wrong-doing, and it should be noted\nthat the majority of the dBs\naudience enjoyed their per-formance. The assault was\nan isolated incident in an otherwise successful Freshers\nWeek for Imperial College\nUnion.\nMr Flint last performed\nwith The Prodigy two years\nago.

He claims\nthat his was a \u201cclassic clich\u00e9d\nstory\u201d.\n\u201cI was always playing practical jokes as a child and getting into trouble in school,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI was never going to be\nthe type of person who could\nhold down two jobs.\u201d\nHe finally made the decision to move to London, and\nhe\u2019s never looked back.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nWith their counter-culture packag-ing, angled fringe haircuts and monumentally stupid name, you\u2019d be\nforgiven for writing off yourcodena-meis:milo as yet another Converseworshipping \u2018emo\u2019 band. I\u2019d already\ndone it without listening to a note.\nBut instead of bastardising At The\nDrive-In\u2019s back catalogue by feeding through Pro-Tools and making\nit pop (cf. Finch), yourcodenameis:\nmilo clearly have a little more ambi-tion.\nTheir sound is a sometimes disquieting mix of lurching, stop-start\nriffage, slower progressive guitar\npassages and the occasional monumental chorus. They\u2019ve inherited\nAt The Drive-In\u2019s love for complex\ndual riffs and innovative chord pro-gressions, Biffy Clyro\u2019s relentless\nvolume changes, and the mighty\nTrail Of Dead\u2019s gloriously over-the-top vocals.\nOpener All Roads To Fault welds\na schizophrenic, shouty verse to a\ntruly massive guitar-destroying chorus that\u2019s convincing enough proof\nof the band\u2019s intent. It helps that it\nhas a hook roughly the size of every\nStrokes chorus put together. The\nProblem jerks from quiet to loud\nalmost without warning, providing\none of the most thrilling moments\non the album, while Fourthree sees\nyourcodenameis:milo using their\nquiet side: pretty, lilting guitars join\nthe heavy moments together, providing a little relief from the assault.\nCapturing the sound of live, heavy\nguitar music has always been a real\nchallenge for producers \u2013 records\njust won\u2019t sell if the guitars don\u2019t\nsound just right. Luckily for your-codenameis:milo, they managed to\nsecure the legendary Steve Albini\nbehind the desk. Once again, his\ntouch proves essential to this record\n\u2013 as First Mater Responds moves\nfrom its heavily compressed verse\ninto a huge wall of grinding distortion with squiggly guitar arpeggios\ndancing everywhere, you can almost\npicture the huge grin on his face.\nThe duelling, call-and-response guitars on the high point of the album\nLions, Then Donkeys will induce\nheadbanging not seen since \u201cOne\nArmed Scissor\u201d in all but the most\nsedate.\nIf anything, yourcodenameis:milo\nhave found a \u2018sound\u2019 that\u2019s incredibly mature for a band so young.\nUnlike, say, Reuben, they\u2019ve not\npainted themselves into a stylistic\ncorner. If you\u2019ve heard a few records\nfrom what could be loosely termed\nthe British rock underground \u2013\nbands like Million Dead and Pretty\nGirls Make Graves \u2013 I can guarantee you\u2019ll find something in this\nrecord to love.\nAndrew Sykes\nMusic Editor\nThere\u2019s something just a tiny bit\nterrifying about Nick Cave. It could\nbe his Neanderthal eyebrows, his\nimpressive bird\u2019s nest hairstyle, or\nhis grave, cadaverous stare. But I\nthink it\u2019s probably the total surrealism of almost everything he does.\nUtterly compelling, but a tiny bit\nterrifying.\nTwo albums packaged as one,\nAbattoir Blues and The Lyre Of\nOrpheus deliver a double dose of the\ndelightful Cave madness. Sounding,\nat various times, like frenetic jazz,\ndisjointed blues, energetic country,\nsmooth easy listening, gothic bal-ladry and a gospel choir on crack,\nthis is an eclectic mix united by a\nmorbid exuberance and some frankly quite mental lyrics. All gleefully\nintoned in Cave\u2019s sepulchral vocals,\nthey range from the self-mocking\n(\u201cI look at you and you look at me\nand deep in our hearts know it /\nThat you weren\u2019t much of a muse,\nbut then I weren\u2019t much of a poet\u201d)\nto the vaguely obscene (\u201cI put one\nhand on your round ripe heart /\nAnd the other down your panties\u201d)\nto the mildly confusing (\u201cI\u2019m down\nhere babe with the eskimos / With\nthe polar bears and the Arctic snow\n/ With a party of penguins who do\nnot know / How I can get back to\nthee\u201d). Referencing historical and\nliterary figures from Karl Marx to\nthe ancient Greek poet Sappho, it\u2019s\nan intelligent and amusing collection that will have you discovering\nnew gems listen after listen.\nThe music itself is heavy on the\npercussion and \u2018unusual\u2019 instruments \u2013 panpipes, anyone? While\nfairly simple, it has a drive that\nrenders it almost hypnotic. At times,\nit seems that the Bad Seeds have\nlost their habitual gloom to begin\nproducing almost upbeat ditties; at\nothers the familiar malaise returns\nwith renewed intensity. Not really\none for the emotionally unstable,\nAbattoir Blues and The Lyre Of\nOrpheus is definitely an acquired\ntaste \u2013 the spooky, dominating\nvocals and schizophrenic rhythms\ncan be unsettling to say the least.\nBut those who dare to brave the\nlunacy \u2013 or who have already picked\nup the urge \u2013 will find themselves\nlistening for hours with a silly little\ngrin on their faces. Mad as a fish\nwith a motorbike but just as much\nfun, this is a nice little treat that just\nkeeps on giving.\nAnna Novitzky\nYou might not have heard of The\nSoundtrack Of Our Lives (TSOOL),\nbut on first listen they are instantly\nfamiliar. This six piece from Sweden\nare fronted by a man who insists on\nwearing a toga all the time, sounding\nat times like Exile On Main Streetera Rolling Stones, and at others\nthe rightful heirs to Pink Floyd\u2019s\nthrone.\n2001\u2019s Behind The Music brought\nTSOOL to the attention of the UK\nmainstream music press. This, their\nfirst album for three years, carries\non exactly were Behind The Music\nleft off. It is an album that grabs you\nfrom the first note, and before you\nknow it, you\u2019ve picked up the entire\nlyrics and sang it to yourself as you\nwait for the bus. Or at least, I have.\nThe single Bigtime is a perfect\nexample of TSOOL\n\u2019s sound, incorporating pleasingly dirty guitars, a\nriff that Keith Richards would chew\nhis own arm off for, and a suitably\nbizarre lyric about the damage done\nto society by technology from the fantastically named Ebbot Lundberg.\nBy the time the anthemic, air-guitar\nfriendly chorus rolls around, you\u2019re\nnodding along while Lundberg yells,\nsomewhat cryptically, \u201cBig time!\nWe\u2019re all partners in crime!\u201d\nThe immediacy of every single\nsong on this record is truly refresh-ing, but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s predict-able. Much more than that \u2013 TSOOL\ntake the same chord changes you\u2019re\nheard a thousand times from a thousand different guitar bands, and\nsomehow make it sound fresh. A\nclever riff here, a well-placed vocal\nline there, and you begin to see how\ngood a band with six very talented\nsongwriters can be. And they\u2019re\nSwedish, which always seems to\nhelp.\nLyrically, Lundberg is quirky and\ndirect. He\u2019s not singing in his native\nlanguage, which often has the effect\nof making the simplest lines sound\nslightly odd. His voice has a wonderful smoky edge to it, which he\nlayers over itself many times \u2013 it\u2019s\nalmost as if there\u2019s a bizarre choir of\nLundbergs singing every word with\nhim. On Midnight Children, he lets\nhis bassy voice ring over a grooving guitar and spacey organ figure,\nrescuing the track from mediocrity.\nIn fact, when the quality control does\nfall, as it does in the middle of the\nalbum, the vocals are usually the\nthing that saves you pressing the\nskip button.\nJust like Behind The Music, the\ninterplay between the two very talented and endlessly versatile guitar-ists, Ian Person and Mattias B\u00e4rjed,\nis what drives the record. Along with\nthe aforementioned Bigtime, Royal\nExplosion showcases their harder,\npower-riffing style. Heading For A\nBreakdown has a delicate two note\npattern in the foreground, and a genius bluesy figure in the background.\nTSOOL aren\u2019t exactly innova-tive; in fact, they\u2019re positively retro.\nThis record isn\u2019t quite as good as\nBehind The Music, which featured\na more diverse sound than that displayed here. Some people may tire\nof the relentless \u2018borrowing\u2019 from\nthe great rock bands of the last 40\nyears, but the unique spin they put\non it prevents them from becoming\na cover band.

    "content": "Schr\u00f6dinger, Schumann\nand psychology\nCan a physics equation, a dead composer and Martin Cansdale explain the mysteries of reality?\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThis is a book about a quantum\nphysicist called John Ringer. It\u2019s\nalso a book about the last days\nof Schumann, an amnesic hospital\npatient called Harry Dick, and the\nwinter in which Schr\u00f6dinger discovered his famous equation. Not\nsatisfied with all this, Mobius Dick\nalso considers reality, coincidence,\nand causality.\nIn a nod towards one of the many\nother works discussed in this book,\nthe four threads are carefully inter-woven. At first, the subplots seem\nlike distractions, with no explanation\nof why the next chapter is a seemingly irrelevant tale of a nineteenth\ncentury composer. As it becomes\napparent that the stories are linked,\nthe question of why they are there\nis replaced by a delightful mystery\nof what they mean. The interplay of\nthe plot strands is clever and effec-tive. Rather than have a main story\nwith the others adding something to\nit, each depends on the others in a\ncomplicated symbiosis. The themes\nof the book are introduced by Ringer,\ndisdained with cool scientific clarity,\nand then picked up and enlarged by\nother characters.\nThe main \u2018Ringer\u2019 plot concerns\nthriller-like events at a research\nstation in the Scottish Highlands.\nIn spite of this, it has a meditative feel given by Ringer\u2019s frequent\nreminiscences and philosophical daydreams. The tempo of the\nbook comes more from movement\nbetween stories than from John\nRinger\u2019s adventures.\nThe tones of the stories are cap-tivatingly varied. Ringer interacts\nwith others, but the story barely\nseems to leave his own train of\nthought.Schr\u00f6dingertalks,observes\nand experiences more vividly, while\nHarry\u2019s amnesic confusion gives a\ncompletely different confused and\nsuperficial air to encounters with\nhis therapists.\nAccording to a review of Crumey\u2019s\nlast novel, Mr Mee, \u201cthe deadpan\nhumour never wavers.\u201d The one\ncriticism I have of this book is\nthat I spent 100 pages wondering\nwhether it was meant to be funny.\nThe author seems to be making\nsly digs at \u2018unscientific\u2019 modes of\nthought, by putting idiotic remarks\nand unfounded conclusions into\nthe mouths of artists and psycholo-gists. Would a \u2018writing therapist\u2019\nreally tell a patient that she was\nonly working in a hospital because\nthere was no money in short story\nwriting? Would a psychologist, in\nwhat seems to be the near future,\nreally jump straight from the name\n\u2018Thomas Mann\u2019 to phallic associa-tions, or ask an amnesic patient to\nguess what symptoms they might\nhave been showing before the accident which robbed them of their\nmemory? It\u2019s not really clear if\nthese attacks are meant to amuse,\nor are part of rather clumsily executed caricatures. Fortunately, this\nproblem becomes less noticeable as\nthe stories progress.\nJohn Ringer uses an analogy to\ndescribe Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation,\nand how it relates to the real world.\nHe compares reality with a giant\nbook, containing all possible stories.\nThe appeal of Mobius Dick comes\nfrom an inversion of this image.\nOf the stories contained within the\nbook, which are \u2018reality\u2019? Are the\nstories all \u2018true\u2019 in the framework\nof the book, or is one somehow\nmore real than the others? Throw in\nquantum mechanics with its prob-abilities, wave-particle duality and\nother common-sense defying con-cepts, and you get a fascinating\nnovel.\nMobius Dick\nby Andrew Crumey\n(Picador)\n\u00a316.99, 312 pages\nHHHHI\n\u201cI spent 100 pages\nwondering whether\nit was meant to be\nfunny\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 14 October 2004 21\nCloset humour\nThere\u2019s something strange in the neighbourhood. Who ya gonna call? A zookeeper, a sex therapist\nand a lifestyle coordinator. Martin Smith, Books Editor, has all their numbers\nScott Spectrum is the slightly\nnerdy brains behind the successful television show Space Man In\nSpace. Space man flies his spaceship around the galaxy and battles\nspace aliens in space. Nice and\nstraightforward, just like Scott\u2019s\nlife. He has a beautiful wife and\na boss who loves him. However,\nagainst all reason, Scott wakes up\none night to find a giraffe in his\nwardrobe. Or rather, the ghost of\na dead giraffe. From here on in,\nthings start to get a bit weird.\nThe Giraffe, Jim, turns out to be\na profane, perverted, beer-swill-ing apparition that seems intent on\nsaving Scott\u2019s life in the style of A\nChristmas Carol, with images from\nhis past, present, and future. The\nkey to this cunning plan seems to\nrest mainly on Scott giving his wife\nContinence \u201ca good seeing to\u201d. And\nso the fun begins in one of the silliest\nbooks I\u2019ve read in quite a while.\nJim Giraffe is a bizarre romp\nthrough the imagination of Daren\nKing, full of zany hairpin bends and,\nabove all, more sexual innuendo\nthan you can shake a large rubber\nphallus at. The character of Jim\nis inspired, and together with the\nwell-meaning but erotically clueless\nScott they make an a very odd but\nextremely funny pair. Even more\nbizarre things happen as any sense\nof ground rules about what is physically possible are discarded. This\nmakes for a very entertaining read\nthat appealed to my twisted sense\nof humour for at least the first third\nof the book. However, as the story\ncontinues, I think the imagination\nbecame a bit too much for me: if\never the writer seemed to back in\nto a corner plot-wise, you could\ntell that yet another \u2018shifting of the\ngoal posts\u2019 was about to occur. Like\nJim sprouting a pair of wings, for\ninstance. Then again, he is an imaginary giraffe... or is he? Anything\ncould happen in a story like this, and\nit often does.\nGoing to bed having read the\nfirst half, I dreamt about the glowing review that I was going to give\nthis book. It was witty, original and\nreadable. However, the final three\nchapters utterly spoilt it for me: it\nseemed as though the author had\ngot a bit bored with the story and\nhad just decided to end it. In short,\nI recommend that you read and\nthoroughly enjoy everything but\nthese three chapters, carefully tear\nthem from the back of the book and\nburn them with a copy of the script\nto the third Matrix film. That way\neveryone\u2019s happy. Then just write\nyour own ending. It shouldn\u2019t be too\nhard, just make something up. Then\nagain, maybe you\u2019re one of those\npeople who likes Marmite, and you\u2019ll\nadore just how random Daren King\ncan be. Reading this has certainly\ninspired me to get hold of Boxy on\nStar, his first book.\n\u25cf The accompanying website,\nwww.jimgiraffe.com, is equally daft and includes a version\nof noughts and crosses with\nScotts and Jims.\nJim Giraffe\nby Daren King\n(Jonathan Cape)\n\u00a310, 216 pages\nHHHII\nWhat\u2019s yellow and dangerous?

    "content": "8 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 14 October 2004\nThe first question you must\nbe asking yourself is what in\nGod\u2019s name is a Rat Race?\nWell, you get a few students\ntogether, you make them run\naround fearlessly and cause\nhavoc, and at the same time\nyou try to get them to an\nunspecified destination. And\nthere you have it, London zoo\nin your back yard. Kind of\nlike the movie Rat Race, but\ninstead of the million dollar\ncash prize and a single des-tination, we tweak the rules\nand make them go to a dozen\nplaces, giving away a few\nthings a little more affordable\nto a students\u2019 union.\nAt first we thought not\nmany people would turn up,\nbut in fact a few dozen came\nalong for a couple of hours of\nmayhem. So, after getting the\nteams registered and named,\nwe read them the rules.\nBut do freshers ever listen?\nAbsolutely not \u2013 it\u2019s not in\ntheir innocuous nature, and\nwho can blame them?\nI have to say it\u2019s quite exciting when teams are ready\nand waiting at the start line\n(like at a marathon) and then\nyou throw them the first clue\nbut hold them down just to\nannoy them, telling them that\nthey have to wait until the\nword \u201cgo\u201d (how exacerbat-ing). Then all of a sudden, a\nherd of rhinos are running\nmad and wild inside Mech\nEng, screaming. Before realizing what was happening, I\ncouldn\u2019t help but think of the\nmovie Jumanji.\nObviously, I\u2019d warned them\nthat running through public\nplaces wasn\u2019t the best idea.\nSo what\u2019s the first thing they\ndo? Run like mad through\nTanaka once the race starts,\npelting each other with water\nballoons and water guns. Of\ncourse this wasn\u2019t outside as\nyou would have expected, but\ninside the building around\nanyone and everyone.\nNaturally,Iplayeddumband\nhad a go at them, because the\nsecurity guards were waiting\nat the door (they probably had\nnothing better to do anyway).\nAfter a bit of negotiation, I\nblagged them out of trouble\nwhile they ran off to catch\nup with the other teams that\ngot away. Imagine Imperial\nunder attack from a bunch\nof guerilla fighters swarming\nthrough the College grounds,\nand add a few laughs in\nbetween unexpected water\nballoon ambushes!\nAs one of the organisers\nwaiting at the various check\npoints, it was like watching a\nslow motion of frenetic racers\nmaking their way to the finishing line. It was also probably one of the funniest things\nI\u2019ve ever seen while standing\naround South Ken.\nI felt bad for the museum\nstaff when they saw students\nwith a bunch of water guns\nrunning in and shouting in a\npanic: \u201cWhere\u2019s the Raphael\npainting room?\u201d or \u201cWhere\nare the dinosaur fossils?\u201d The\nonly thought going through\ntheir mind was probably: \u201cWe\nneed emergency back up.\u201d\nThen it hit me: what if they\nget arrested?\nWe started a water splash\nout in front of the Science\nMuseum and in the College\nwalkway next to STA Travel,\nand it seemed like almost everyone was wet for the most\npart of the Rat Race. It was\ngreat to see them all going\nwith the flow, and just letting\nloose. The groups were getting through the check points\npretty well, (with the aid of a\nfew carefully directed hints\nfrom CGCU officers).\nAt the STA travel check\npoint on the Sherfield\nWalkway, Helen, Caroline and\nRob waited patiently in their\ntraditional yet garish CGCU\nblazers, making the check\npoint unmistakable. However,\nthe freshers took a while to\nget there and we got bored\nwaiting. So we decided to\nhide with our water guns and\nlaunch a surprise attack from\nbehind, showering all the racers and a fair few passers by\nas well.\nAll hell then broke lose once\nthe freshers realised they\ncould get extra points for hitting people with water bombs.\nVery soon, the walkway was\nawash with water and crawling with security guards! Rob\nsheepishly took most of the\nblame while security gave us\nall a \u201cgood ticking off\u201d for\nenhanced effect. The entire\nconversation was caught on\ncamera by STOIC TV and it\nwent along the lines of:\nSecurity Guard: \u201cWhich\ndepartment are you from?\u201d\nRob: \u201cLots.\u201d\nGuard: \u201cWhat are you\ndoing?\u201d\nRob: \u201cA Treasure hunt [tri-umphant grin].\u201d\nGuard: \u201cWho\u2019s responsible\nfor the water guns?\u201d\nRob: \u201cLots of people.\u201d\nAnd so, after Rob finished\ngiving the Security Guards\nlots of inherently irrelevant\ninformation, we made a run\nfor it, only to be caught again\non the other side of campus\n\u2013 this time resulting in several names being put down\nfor reference.\nThe funniest moment of all\nhad to be getting the fresh-ers to do star jumps and\ngymnastics on the steps of\nthe Albert Hall. How did we\nmanage that? Well, when\nthere\u2019s a cool prize involved,\nthe momentum\u2019s there and\nyou\u2019ve got nothing to lose,\nthen you can pretty much\nget freshers to do anything\nyou want. And did we hesi-tate? Not for a minute! You\nshould have seen everyone\u2019s\nfaces, especially the music\nscholars walking out of the\ncollege, shocked, and probably thinking \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong\nwith those IC students?\u201d\nI was a bit scared when a\nbunch of police officers drove\npast. \u201cTechnically\u201d we need\na licence to play loud music\nin a public place, but luckily\nthey didn\u2019t stop. Let\u2019s hope\nwe don\u2019t receive a court summons in next week\u2019s mail.\nYou could see there was a\nfriendly rivalry, which I hope\nwe can extend to all Imperial\nCollege Faculty Unions. Let\u2019s\ncontinue to all have a laugh\ntogether, because before you\nknow it, your time at uni is up\nand little stories are all that\u2019s\nleft. The only thing left to say\nis that I hope we see you at\none of our next CGCU events.\nWatch this space.\nHands in the air: freshers do starjumps on the steps of the Royal Albert Hall, as part of Rat Race 2004\nClubs & Societies felix@ic.ac.uk\nCITY & GUILDS\nCOLLEGE UNION\n\u201cWho\u2019s responsible for the water guns?\u201d\nIn the CGCU Rat Race 2004, several dozen freshers caused havoc as they searched\nfor clues and tried to reach their \u201cunspecified destination\u201d. Henri Ozarovsky and\nHelen Dawson attempt to put the madness into words\nA martial art for the 21st century\nBy Alex Gibson\nKrav Maga is one of the latest martial arts to reach the\nUK. Originally developed by\nthe Israeli Defence Force, it is\nnow taught to everyone, from\nthe special forces to civilians\nlooking for an effective means\nof self-defence.\nKrav Maga uses instinctive\nmovements that are easy to\nremember in dangerous situ-ations, and combinations of\nstrikes, locks and holds to disable attackers. Training also\nincludes practising with multiple opponents, and learning\ndefences against attackers\narmed with anything from\nknives and baseball bats\nto firearms. Environment\nawareness is also part of the\ncourse, which can ideally\nprevent you from getting into\na confrontation in the first\nplace.\nThe overall emphasis is on\ntraining for \u201creal life\u201d situa-tions, which is reflected in the\nscenarios practised. There\nis also a strong fitness ele-ment, with exercises done to\nimprove strength, coordina-tion, and dexterity.\nI started training at the\nLondon Academy of Krav\nMaga (LAKM) last November,\nand can highly recommend\nthe instructors for both their\nprofessionalism and sense of\nhumour \u2013 classes are great\nfun to go to as well as providing high level training. It\u2019s\npossible to take on sparring\norientated classes too, as well\nas take grades. A number of\nseminars are held throughout the year, with instructors\ncoming from as far afield as\nthe US and Israel to demonstrate and discuss new tech-niques.\nThe LAKM have recently\nopened up a new venue near\nGloucester Road aimed at\nImperial students, and hope\nto establish themselves as\nan official Union club soon.\nIf you\u2019re at all interested,\nthen why not pop along for\na free introductory lesson?\nThe Class meets between\n4.30 and 6pm on Tuesdays,\nat St Stephen\u2019s Church\nHall, 48 Emperor\u2019s Gate\n(just off Gloucester Road).\nAlternatively, feel free to\ncontact me on alexander.\ngibson@ic.ac.uk, and check\nout the LAKM website, www.\nkrav-maga.org.uk.\nKRAV MAGA\nKrav Maga in action\n\n"

    "content": "In America you can now get car\nstickers in support of John Kerry\nwhich simply read: \u201cHe\u2019ll do.\u201d I doubt\nthat this is authorised campaign\nmerchandise, but it does highlight\nthe current trend in politics \u2013 it\u2019s\nnot that you vote for your favourite\ncandidate, you just don\u2019t vote for\nyour least favourite. And in a two\nhorse race, that doesn\u2019t leave many\noptions. Kerry isn\u2019t going to publicly\nbase his campaign solely on the fact\nthat he isn\u2019t George Bush, although\neverybody knows that this fact alone\nwill win him plenty of votes in the\nNovember poll.\nThis side of the pond, the situation\nis remarkably similar, right down to\nthe key dividing issue \u2013 Iraq. Except\nover here, not only do we worry\nabout whether the war was right,\nbut also the extent to which we,\nor rather the Government, blindly\nfollowed in America\u2019s footsteps.\nEveryone has a view on the issue\n\u2013 plenty against, a few for, and a lot\nof us somewhere in between.\nFor those vehemently against the\nmilitary action, the next general\nelection (which is expected by May\n2005) will be the long-awaited opportunity to get rid of Tony Blair. Who\ndo they vote for instead? Who cares,\nas long as it\u2019s not Blair.\nBlair, Blair, Blair... but what about\nthe rest of the Government? When\ncriticising the UK\u2019s actions over\nIraq, most will blame Tony Blair\ndirectly. Following the brutal and\ntragic murder of Ken Bigley last\nweek, there were claims that \u201cBlair\nhas blood on his hands\u201d. Not the\ngovernment, not Labour, but Blair.\nPerhaps if he did stick to his alleged\nagreement to step aside and hand\nover the reigns to Gordon Brown,\nLabour\u2019s election campaign would\nbe a much easier ride.\nThe fact that the Prime Minister\nhas become almost the exclusive\nhate figure represents the disparity within the Labour party that\ncould ironically rescue it at the elec-tion. Plenty of Labour MPs vocally\nopposed the war and continue to\ndo so, and many do an excellent\njob serving their local communities.\nThis could be enough to tip some\nanti-war, anti-Blair votes back into\nthe red territory. I refer to this as\nthe call centre effect \u2013 you get all\nriled up with the phone/gas/electric-ity/catalogue company, but then get\nthrough to the most pleasant underpaid telephonist and end up apolo-gising for bothering them with your\ncomplaint. Or is that just weak willed\nme? Damn, manipulated again.\nIs it wrong to vote like that? Well\ntechnically no \u2013 you\u2019re electing your\nlocal MP\n, not the government. It just\nhappens to be the rule that whichever party gets the majority of the seats\n(give or take) also gets the keys to\nDowning Street. The Prime Minister\ngets elected by the back door, almost\nas an afterthought. It sounds daft\nput like that, but it\u2019s based on the\nreasonable assumption that if the\nMPs are popular, so too will be the\nparty leader. Unfortunately this goes\nhorribly wrong with big issues such\nas Iraq \u2013 disagreements occur, and\nthe party fragments. Ironically, in\nthis case, it could work in Labour\u2019s\nfavour. Blair may act like he\u2019s a\npresident, but it\u2019s lucky for him that\nhe\u2019s not elected as one.\nFor those not distracted by local\nissues who are determined to get\nrid of this government, the question\nis \u2013 what, or who, now? The opposition obviously, that\u2019s what they\u2019re\nthere for\u2026 oh hang on, that\u2019s the\nConservatives isn\u2019t it. And Michael\nHoward. Oh...\nSuddenly it becomes a bit more\nobvious why, despite the Iraq mess,\nthe election still isn\u2019t clear cut.\nHaving followed the conferences\nquite closely this week (I have a stack\nof newspapers here that my father\nwould be proud of), the resounding\nmessage from Bournemouth seems\nto be \u201cwe\u2019re nice people really, please\nbe our friends\u201d, like the unpopular\nkid on the first day of school.\nThere are two parts to this \u2013 first-ly, shedding the stuffy, grey image\nembodied by John Major. \u201cA little less conversation, a little more\naction\u201d echoed around the conference hall. Shadow cabinet ministers\nappeared in video diaries gushing\nabout their personal lives, announcing for example that they enjoyed\nlistening to Dido CDs in a bid to\nconvince us that they actually are\nreal people. But do we mind if our\npoliticians are a bit stuffy \u2013 let\u2019s face\nit, one of the Tories\u2019 most popular\ncharacters is Boris Johnson, and\nnobody would suggest he\u2019s a real\nperson!\nThe second prong of the attack\nis the policies. At least the\nConservatives have some, but many\nseem to have been devised with\nDaily Mail readers firmly in mind\n\u2013 don\u2019t like speed cameras? We\u2019ll\nscrap them! Immigration: bad!\nAsylum seekers: evil! It\u2019s all a bit\nreactionary for my liking, taking on\nthe easy targets. Still, it\u2019s worth a\ntry \u2013 but they should remember\nthat just because people rant about\nthings, it doesn\u2019t make them sound\npolitical policies.\nThe highlight of the week had to\nbe when Busted added their support\nto Howard\u2019s band of merry men.\nI honestly don\u2019t know who to feel\nmore sorry for.\nSo with the Conservatives in a\nstate, where does that leave us. The\nLib Dems? Before they even start\nwith policies, they need to get people\nto take them seriously. There have\nbeen glimmers of hope, but there\nare still a lot of people who won\u2019t\nvote for them because they think\nit\u2019s a waste of time and effort. The\nproblem is only compounded by the\nanti-Iraq movement, with the Tories\npicking up the vote of Lib Dem supporters who ultimately are more\ndetermined to get rid of Blair and so\nsupport the most likely candidate to\nbanish him to the political graveyard\n\u2013 or Bayswater as the post number\n10 residence is to be for Tony and\nCherie.\nUKIP? You\u2019re having a laugh,\nright? Europe may have been\nthe big issue at the last election,\nbut look what the negative policy\nnow favoured by UKIP did for the\nTories last time around. I\u2019m sorry,\nbut Robert Kilroy-Silk gives me the\ncreeps. At least when he was doing\nthe talk show you could avoid him\n\u2013 now he jumps out when you least\nexpect it, like some monster in a bad\nhorror film. And when did UKIP (the\nacronym) become \u2018Ukip\u2019 as far as\nall the papers are concerned? Is it\ntoo tiring to hold down the shift key\nfor so long? More likely, they want\nus to forget what it stands for (UK\nIndependence Party, in case you\ndidn\u2019t know), to avoid the continuing\naccusations of being a one-policy\nparty. There are other policies, after\nall. Erm... anyone?\nSo where does this leave us? I\nhave no idea. Still, that will make for\nan interesting election, I suppose.\nDid you notice that I haven\u2019t really\ndiscussed any of the actual issues in\nany significant depth? Should there\nbe so much other stuff to talk about?\nWell like it or not it seems that there\nis. But for those of you who actually\ncare what these people are standing\nfor, if anything at all, next week I\u2019ll\ncast my cynical eye on the major\nparties\u2019 views on student funding\nand see if any of them can come up\nwith something resembling a fair,\nand dare I say effective, solution.\nJAMES ROBINSON\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 14 October 2004 7\nWho will you not vote for?\nIn the current political climate, voting for your favourite candidate seems less important\nthan making sure your least favourite candidate doesn\u2019t win\nWould you call your friend if you\nknew it would cost you \u00a32 for five\nminutes? If you answered no to that\nquestion and are shocked that a five\nminute call could cost that much,\nthen this article is just for you.\nFirst off, mobile networks in the\nUK are especially known to be\ndodgy when it comes to educating\npotential customers about the true\ncost of using their services. Many of\nyou might have seen ads promising\n\u201cdouble minutes\u201d or \u201chalf price line\nrental\u201d, but upon reading the itsy\nbitsy text at the bottom you will discover that there are as many strings\nattached to the offer as there are to\nPinocchio. That is why I have written the following guide, for freshers\nand seniors alike, to help guide you\nthrough the labyrinth of choices and\nto give you the lowdown on each of\nthe networks.\nAt the moment, there are eight\nnetworks available to choose from\nin London. They are Vodafone,\nT-Mobile, Orange, O2, Three, BT\nMobile, Virgin Mobile and Tesco\nMobile. Many of you might never\nhave heard of some of these before,\nbut don\u2019t panic, I\u2019ll cover them all\nhere. In addition to the eight, there\nis another network, Easy Mobile,\nexpected to be launched by the end\nof the year.\nThe first six networks mentioned\nabove all offer postpaid/monthly\nservices. This means that you agree\nto pay a certain amount of money\neach month in return for a fixed\nbundle of call minutes and/or texts.\nAlternatively, all of the eight networks (except BT) offer another\nservice called prepay, more commonly known as pay-as-you-go. This\nmeans that you pay only for the calls\nor texts that you make. Generally,\nmonthly is better for people who\nconsistently call or text a lot, and\nprepay is better for those who sporadically use their phones to make\nquick calls. The bundled minutes in\na monthly service is usually cheaper\nthan if you call the exact same minutes using prepay, but bear in mind\nthat if you don\u2019t use up the minutes\n(perhaps you are on holiday over-seas) in a particular month, they\nusually cannot be rolled over and\nyou end up paying for something\nyou didn\u2019t use.\nUnlike many other countries, calling a mobile on a different network in\nUK usually is much more expensive\nthan calling a mobile on the same\nnetwork or calling a landline. For\nexample, calling a Vodafone mobile\nfrom an O2 mobile would cost 45p,\nwhereas an O2 to O2 call would only\ncost 15p. Therefore, a good tip would\nbe to get a mobile on the same network as most of your friends, otherwise you might find yourself with a\nhuge bill! Another difference in the\nUK is that most incoming calls are\nfree, so it is often a good idea to get\nsomeone to call you instead of you\ncalling them. Bear in mind, though,\nthat calling a friend and hanging up\nafter a ring in order to get them to\ncall you back might be the quickest\nway to lose that friendship!\nThankfully, some networks have\nrealized that what customers really\nwant is a fixed rate to call any net-work, as remembering which network your friends are on takes up\nvaluable brain power which should\nbe conserved for remembering stuff\nlike which pubs offer the cheapest\npints. Tesco Mobile and Three are\nboth good choices if you call numbers on other networks often. Tesco\ncharges a flat rate of 20p per minute\nto any mobile or landline, and an\nincredibly cheap 10p per minute to\nany three numbers of your choice.\nOn the other hand, there is Three,\nwhich offers you calls to other networks at 12p a minute, with calls to\nThree mobiles at 5p and landlines\nat 10p.\nSome of you might be wondering\nif there are offers specifically for\nstudents. I am glad to say that there\nare, although I can\u2019t say I am too\nimpressed with them. Vodafone and\nOrange both have student offers,\nwith the former giving 250 free texts\na month if you sign up for the \u00a330\n\u201cAnytime 200\u201d plan, and the latter\ngiving 1000 free texts and 50% off\ncalls to UK landlines. This, at first,\nseems a good deal (after all, free\nstuff is best, right?) However, upon\ncloser inspection, a 12 or 18 month\ncontract is required, and the phones\non offer look like old stock from the\n1990s. You are better off taking one\nof the numerous other plans that\nthey offer.\nThe other networks that I haven\u2019t\ncovered yet (T-Mobile, BT Mobile,\nand Virgin Mobile) appeared to me\nas dull, although there were some\nunique points about them. T-Mobile\nhas cheap off-peak plans for calling your friends on weekends, but\nunfortunately they charge you \u00a33\nextra if you don\u2019t pay by direct debit.\nBT Mobile was just boring (perhaps\nthat\u2019s why I haven\u2019t found a single person on it so far), and Virgin\nMobile is only worthwhile if you text\na lot to other Virgin mobiles (3p per\ntext).\nIn a nutshell, there\u2019s a multitude\nof choices out there, and it is best to\nchoose carefully or you might end\nup wasting your week\u2019s allowance\non one or two calls.\nMobile networks: what they try to hide\nDid you know a five minute call could easily cost you \u00a32? Boon Koh investigates\nCalls can be costly: make sure you get the best mobile deal\n\n"
