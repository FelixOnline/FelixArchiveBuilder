    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday September 5th19862 Handbook:\nBarclays\nControversy\nFlares Up\nDear FELIX,\nI feel that I must make some comment concerning\nthis year's Handbook. Although it is undoubtedly an\nextremely informative, well balanced and clearly laid\nout piece of literature, the whole effect does tend to be\nsomewhat spoilt when on opening the front cover the\nfirst thing one sees is an advert for Barclays Bank.\nBarclays' position as the major banker of apartheid\nhas been widely reported and discuss sd recently, so in\nthe light of this controversy would it not have been\nsensible to find some other advertising to fill what\namounts to only \u00a3500 worth of space? Although it is\ntrue that IC Union has no policy on Barclays (the AntiApartheid motion not having obtained a hearing so\nfar), all the same a great deal of anger and upset could\nhave been avoided by sidestepping an advert with such\nemotive overtones.\nFinally, Judith Hackney must be congratulated for\nproducing what must be the best Handbook for some\nyears\u2014it is a shame that this achievement should be\nmarred in this way. How long will it be before IC\nUnion does have some policy on Barclays so that\nsituations such as this can be avoided in he future?\nYours sincerely,\nCharles Troup\nDecision\nDefended\nDear David,\nThe ICU Handbook has just returned from the\nprinters and already there has been criticism of my\ndecision to include a Barclays Bank advertisement.\nThis decision was not lightly made; the overriding\nconsideration was a financial one since several other\nregular advertisers had pulled out and the Handbook\nwas set to show a deficit of several hundreds. When, at\nthe eleventh hour, the ICU Exec, made known their\nwish that the advert should be removed, I agreed that\nthe Handbook should carry a loose insert giving\nreasons why the University of London Union does not\naccept Barclays cheques.\nEverybody coming to IC is intelligent and has a right\nto open an account with the so-called 'dirty' banks. (It\nshould be noted that all the four major banks have\ninterests in South Africa). I also have to point out that\nevery Handbook up to now has carried a Barclays\nadvert and that we still have no policy on Barclays.\nI stand by my decision.\nYours,\nJudith Hackney\nICU Handbook Editor\n1986/87\nAn Appeal\nDear Sir/Madam,\nI am writing to you as I believe that in your\ncapacity as President of the Students' Union you\nmay well be able to be of assistance to me and my\nfamily.\nTo put you in the picture, my daughter has been\nin hospital for several months and is to return home\nshortly to recoup e rate. Her illness is in no way\ninfectious but the doctors believe that she will need\nabout a year to recover, before she can return to\nwork. Initially, I shall be able to stay with her but\nafter that I wish to make arrangements for\nsomeone to come to our home every day so that she\nis not left entirely alone every day. I therefore\nthought it might be possible that a student would\nbe willing to come in for a few hours once or twice a week during the afternoon. I would point out that\nmy daughter does not need a nurse but merely\nwishes to have somebody else present in the flat.\nThe student would not be expected to keep her\ncompany and would be free to read or pursue their\nstudies as they wish.\nIf you think it would be at all possible that you\ncould put us in touch with a student who could help\nus out in the way described above I should be most\ngrateful. I should add that we live in South\nKensington, near the Gloucester Road tube and\nthat, if required, we would be happy to provide you\nwith references. I can be reached during the day at\nthe address and telephone number given above.\nWith kind regards,\nYoursfaithfully,\nMaria Gani-Senger.\n(Editor's note:\nAnyone interested should contact Christine Taig in\nthe Union Office).\nDesperation\nDavid Jones John Noakes\nSir,\nHave you by chance noticed the remarkable\nsimla rit y between ex-Blue Peter presenter John 'get\ndown Shep' Noakes and FELIX Editor David 'man\nabout town' Jones. I wonder if they are by any chance\nrelated?\nYoursfaithfully\nS Kirk\nFELIX NOTICE: Owing to the impending move of the\nFelix Office, and to other severe technical difficulties we will\nnot be taking on printing work until after the beginning of\nterm. This includes publicity for Freshers fair.\nAnnual Report\nA significant amount of time and\neffort is currently being spent on\npromoting the image of Imperial\nCollege, both to prospective\nstudents and parents, and to people\nin industry. Since the beginning of\nthe summer vacation, the re styled annual report has been in\npreparation and is due to be\npublished in early October. Unlike\nprevious reports, which have been\nchiefly a weighty collection of facts\nand figures, this year's production\nis a glossy brochure aimed at\nselling the College to the reader.\nNext month IC will host the\nUniversity of London Science for\nIndustry Exhibition. This is\nanother excellent opportunity for\nthe College to stress to prospective\nstudents its reputation as a leading\nscience college. Whilst this\napproach is logical enough, it is\ndisappointing that the College\nshould always take pains to\nemphasize IC's well established\nreputation as a science institute\nrather than examine critically\nwhether that reputation is matched\nby the quality of the courses it\nprovides.\nHandbook\nThe Barclays Bank motion has my\nfull support and, like Mr Troup, I hope IC Union will shortly adopt it\nas policy. As Editor of FELIX I am\nin the fortunate position of being\nable to choose for myself whether\nor not to comply with any\nrecommendation for no Barclays'\nadvertising. This is not the case for\nthe Handbook Editor and I would\nask the Exec, to remember that\nnone of their immediate\npredecessors would have turned a hair over the inclusion of a Barclays' advert. In Judith's position I would have felt entirely\njustified in refusing to agree to the\ninclusion of a disclaimer.\nCredits\nUnbelievable thanks to Judith\nHackney, Sunny Bains, Chris\nEdwards, Simon Lewis, Hugh\nSouthey, Mark Cottle, Sarah\nKirk, Chris Hall, Lisa Edinger,\nJane Spiegel, Christine Taig,\nJackie Peirce and Dave Colley.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on\nbehalf of Imperial College Union Publications\nBoard and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit.

    "content": "Opininn\nUnion Blues\nAN OPINION BY HUGH STILES\nIt looks very much as if next year\nwill see the merger of Saint Mary's Medical School into Imperial\nCollege. The first such\" change in\nthe College stricture since it\nformed through merger around the\nturn of the century. What does this\nall mean in terms of the Union?\nThe general concensus amongst\nUnion Officers last year was that St\nMary's can best be accommodated\ninto the existing Union structure as\na fourth Constituent College Union\n(CCU). This is a fine idea, however\nit will not work.\nDecisions in the Union are\nessentially made by two bodies:\nCouncil and Exec. The former\nmeets once a month in term time to\nhear reports from Officers and to\nconsider the minutes of all the sub-committees. Exec meets more\noften and undertakes business that\ncannot wait for next Council, room\nbookings, discipline and similar. If\nCouncil is in quo rate then the\nun fabled business defaults to Exec.\nExec is formed by the President,\nDeputy President, Hon Sec, and\nthe Presidents of each of the\nCCUs. Thus adding a fourth C CU President would give the CC Usa majority in the Exec. This I believe\nwould be unacceptable to most\nUnion Officers.\nOne way around the problem\nwould be to take on board a fourth\nsabbatical Officer; a Deputy\nPresident (Services). Consider\nhow the DP's job has expanded in\nrecent years. There is now\nNorman's Snackbar, the Union\nBar, the Regalia cum Sport-shop\nand the Bookshop (jointly\nadministered with the CCUs) all to\nbe run in addition to the DP's original duties. Further, the\npressure on the Union administrative staff (Jen and Pat) has been\nincreased by all the extra\ndocumentation to process.\nGoodness knows, they had plenty\nto do before all this extra work.\nTherefore having another\nsabbatical would mean that the\nexisting members of the Union\nOffice would be able to give their\nfullest attention to their old duties\nwhilst the new sabbatical devoted\nall his/her time to keeping the\nvarious Union services trading\nprofitably. Harking back to the\nearlier mention \"of Council, you\nmay be aware that there was a good\ndeal of trouble last year in getting\nCouncil quo rate( it must be\nquo rate to commence business).\nWhy was this?\nThe real problem is that Council\nis not only composed of Union\nOfficers; every department also\nhas a representative and, since\nthese seem to consider themselves\nprimarily answerable to their own\nC CU, they do not bother to turn\nup. To take these Dep Reps off\nCouncil is problematic \u2014 they\nrepresent their Departments and\ntheir Departmental clubs. This\nleads to another point. It is possible\nfor unprincipled CC Us to persuade\nDep Reps to turn up to Council and\nvote with the C CU simply by\nthreatening to with old or reduce\nthe departmental club's grant. To\nmy mind the problem could be\nsolved by placing all he\ndepartmental clubs in a Major Sub\nCommittee (MSC). Therefore one\nperson would replace all the Dep\nReps on Council, thereby reducing\nquorum and leading to more\nbusiness being conducted at\nCouncil rather than defaulting to\nExec. Opportunities could then be\nmade, principally through C CU channels, for Dep Reps to air their\ngrievances. Hence the Dep Reps\nwould lose nothing and in fact they\ncould be rendered solely\nanswerable to their CCUs.\nNow the CC Us and MSCs have\nnever got on very well, especially\nwhere finance is concerned. This is\ndecided primarily at Union Finance\nCommittee with the MSCs and the\nCC Us accusing each other of not\ndoing enough to cut their\nestimates. Every year in Council or\nat UGMs we hear that the CC Us are 'independent and autonomous\nwithin ICU'. If this is the case then\nMS C/CC U friction could be easily\nreduced.\nLet the CC Us go to College for\ntheir sub vent ions in just the same\nmanner that ICU has to. How could\nthey object? If they are not\nhoodwinking UFC they have\nnothing to lose. Objections on their\npart would surely indicate sharp\npractices somewhere in their grant\nclaims.\nSince changes will have to be\nmade anyway in order to\naccommodate St Mary's, the\nUnion should take advantage of\nthis golden opportunity to\nstreamline and simplify its\ncommittees.\nThe year to come is an\nunprecedented opportunity to\nchange the Union's structure, to\nmake it more responsive to the\nwishes of the ordinary students, to\nmake the machinery of decision\nmaking clearer and more\naccess able and above all to get the\nUnion working once again as a unit\nwith no internal divisions\nrepresenting your views to College.\nPlease give some thought to the\nideas put forward here. The Union\ncannot continue forever suffering\ninternal schisms and rifts. It must\nevolve or die. I would rather it were\nthe former.\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY'S GARAGE( Personal service guaranteed)\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE MEWS SOUTH KENSINGTON LONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 581 1589\n\u2022 For Sale VIS I CALC4 spreadsheet for IBM PC and compatibles.

Set in\nAndersontown, Belfast and Dublin,\nOurselves Alone is at times\nfearfully funny, but rarely does it\nprovide the specific intensity or\nanger associated with the issues of\nNorthern Ireland. Instead it deals\nwith the theme of antagonism\nbetween emotional and political\nfeelings.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded1949 Generous Kenneth Education Secretary Kenneth Baker\nhas announced an increase of \u00a354\nmillion in funds for colleges and\npolytechnics in 1987/88. This brings\ntotal funding for these areas of\ntertiary education to \u00a3715 million,\nand represents an increase of 8% on\nthe figure for 1986/87, far exceeding\nmost expectations.\nMr Baker set out the proposals in\na letter to Mr George Walden,\nChairman of the National Advisory\nBody for Public Sector Higher\nEducation. Of the \u00a354 million\nincrease, \u00a339 million will be added\ndirectly to the total available for the\npublic sector of higher education,\nand \u00a315 million will be 'applied\nselectively' by Mr Baker in areas\nlike science and technology and\n'applied research of value to\nindustry'.\nIn his letter, Mr Baker described\nhis proposal as 'generous' and said\nthat he was sure it was a good\ninvestment. He commended\nparticularly the polytechnics,\nquoting an increase in 'full-time\nequivalent numbers' of 45%, and a reduced unit cost of 18%.\nThe surprise announcement\ncomes after the National Advisory\nBody had proposed drastic\nreductions in the number of\nstudents admitted to colleges and\npolytechnics, anticipating that cuts\nwould be essential. The basic\nincrease is still less than that\ndemanded by the NAB to maintain\nstudent numbers at the current\nlevel, but when the \u00a315 million for\n'special schemes' is included, the\nsum on offer is greater than that\nclaimed.\nMr Baker stressed his\ncommit t ment to maintain access to\nhigher education and said that the\nmoney he was making available\nshould allow for expansion at\npolytechnics and colleges of higher\neducation. Though impressed with\nthe overall record of the public\nsector, he added that not all\ninstitutions were performing to this\nlevel, and lend particular emphasis\non the staff-student ratio.\nFELIX Blues The production of the first term-time issues of FELIX may be\ndisrupted owing to delay in\nconversion work on the new Print\nUnit offices.

    "content": "News_\nTower\nDrill\nThe Queens Tower was swarming\nwith firemen early last month as\npart of a rescue exercise organised\nfor members of the Kensington,\nChelsea, and Fulhamfirebrigades.\nThe chief aim of the drill, arranged\nin coordination with the College's Red Cross and safety units, was to\ndetermine how difficult it would be\nto rescue a visitor to the Tower if\nthey were injured or taken seriously\nill. The firemen experienced\nconsiderable difficulty in getting the\n'victim' down the narrowest\nstairways in upper levels of the\ntower, but it was later decided that a special stretcher would be sufficient\nfor a successful rescue.\nThe fire brigade also performed a breathing apparatus drill when\nreserving two dummy bodies from\nthe tunnels immediately under the\nTower.\nSurprise\nProfits\nFigures are coming in about the\nperformance of the Union's Sports\nShop and Snack Bar. The Sports\nShop made an un predicted profit of\n\u00a32500 after having lost money last\nyear. Union Deputy President,\nJackie Peirce, puts this down to the\ncutting of opening hours and the\nreduction of staff to one person.\nHowever, the Snack Bar did not\nmake as much money as expected\ndespite a turnover of \u00a351500. Ms\nPeirce said that this was because\n'prices coming in were too high and\nprices going out too low'. She did\nnot predict a great - increase in\nprices, though, as she believes that\nthe Snack Bar is essentially meant\nto provide a service to students and\nnot just a money-making operation\nfor the Union.\nSpanner In The Works\nSpanner, the handbook of City &\nGuilds Union, will not appear on\ntime this year because of a computer fault. Richard Davis, co-Editor of Spanner, had almost\ncompleted the Handbook using an\nApple Mackintosh Pagemaker\nwhen a system failure resulted in\nCounting The Cost\nmost of his work being lost. As a result Spanner will not be ready in\ntime to be mailed with the ICU\nHandbook. Mr Davis is aiming to\nhave Spanner ready for Freshers'\nWeek but admits this may not be\npossible.\nThe Chemistry Basement During The Flood\nThe Chemistry Basement When Cleared\nThe flood in the basement of the\nChemistry building on July 31st( See FELIX 745) is estimated to\nhave caused between \u00a37000 and\n\u00a310000 of damage. The flood was\nprobably caused by a valve being\nleft open, but Chief Engineer,\nDavid Evans, pointed out that this\ncould not be confirmed since the\nestates workers and fire brigade\nopened and closed a large number\nof valves in attempting to control\nthe flooding.\nThe Union Executive have\ndiscovered that the IBM PC\ncompute T system which has been\npurchased by the Union is\neffectively useless as it stands. The\nsystem was ordered by last year's President, Carl Burgess, under the\nguidance of Internal Services\nOfficer, Alan Rose, at a cost of\napproximately \u00a33000. It is intended\nto handle the Union's accounts and\nfor word processing. The problems are twofold:\nfirstly, certain of the items delivered\nby dealers Xitan Systems were not\nthose originally specified. The\nkeyboards for example are designed\nfor use with a different machine and\nprevent certain keys being used.\nHowever, the situation is made\nfar worse by the fact that many of\nthe components of the system are\nincompatible or inappropriate to\nthe use for which they were\nintended. The additional memory\nComputing\nCatastrophe\nunits installed are not suitable for\nrunning the popular Lotus 1-2-3\npackage which has also been\npurchased. Additionalmemory and\nideally a co-processor are also\nrequired. The video cards in the\nmachines at present prevent the use\nof many of the facilities offered by\nthe Lotus software. Also useless is\nthe Epsom printer which has been\nbought, not only has it arrived\nwithout an appropriate parallel\ninterface but it is an obsolete model\nand it is unlikely that new parts for\nit can be obtained.\nThe Union staff are not happy\neither with some of the software\nThe word processor program is not\nthe best choice for those intended to\nuse it and no arrangements have\nbeen made for training for the full-time staff. While a Pascal compiler\nbought at a cost of \u00a3152 appa rant ly has no use apart from allowing\npeople to do their computing\ncoursework on the machine.\nIt is thought that \"some of the\nhardware can be returned to the\ndealers and credited against future\npurchases by College who are a large customer for suck equipment.

Professor Ash will\nbe speaking on the 'Information'\nTechnology Revolution' on Friday\nOctober 17.\nParsons\nWins Silver\nImperial College high jumper Geoff\nParsons won a silver medal in the\nCommonwealth games at\nEdinburgh last month when he\ncleared a height of 2.28 m. Geoffs\nperformance in the European\nGames in Stuttgart last week was\ndiss a pointing however; he failed to\nwin a medal.\n\u00a3200 For\nHandbook\nIn a bid to \"strengthen the links\nbetween Imperial and its\nneighbouring.' colleges, the Rector\nlias made^vail able \u00a3200 for extra\ncopies of this year's ICU Handbook\nto be sent to the Royal College of\nArt and Royal College of Music.\nThis is part of Professor Ash's plan\nto get students from the RCA and\nRCM to use Imperial's facilities and\ntie come n fore involved in its clubs\nand societies.\nStonewalled\nStudents of RCSU are still having\ndifficulty getting into their office\nfollowing the construction of a wall\nas part of the conversion of the\nformer SAC Office into a flat. The\nplans for this conversion were\nshown to last year's ICU Exec who\ngave their approval; it is not clear\nwhether the obstructing wall was\nincluded at this time and Carl\nBurgess, ex-ICU President, has\nsince denied that he ever saw the\nplans.\nRCS students currently have to\nenter their office via the Southside\nHalls entrance (West end) and\nthrough the door onto the link\npassage. Few students have keys to\nthe Halls and hence cannot gain\naccess.\nNew Club\nWork is in progress on the new\nHolland Club in the basement of\nthe Sherfield Building. The new\nclub is due to be opened by the\nRector on December 1st. Bike Crash\nThere was a minor motorcycle\naccident on campus last Friday\nwhen a student came off his bike\nafter turning across a trail of oil.\nThe accident occurred around\n4.30pm.

Only two students are\nnow working in the tower and there\nare no guided tours.

    "content": "Feat ura FELIX, Friday September 5th1986r Capital Ideas has\nbeen cremated and\nDown & Out in\nLondon has risen\nphoenix-like from\nthe ashes to continue its good work\npromoting the arty-far ty. Today I decided\nlife was worth living\nafter all. At least\nfor the next month\nanyway. Tomorrow sees London' s best\nFREE fireworks\ndisplay over the\nbanks of the\nRiver Thames starting at\n8.30pm. It's part of Thames day which has been\nrescued from\nthe demise of\n,. the GLC by\n1\nthe SouthBank Board and retains\nj? the aerobatics,\n^ craft stalls,\nbarge races\n(j and power boats\n^ in the true\n\u00ab Thames day tradition.\nOn the river banks\nyou'll find all\nmanner of enter-, tain ment s: brass\nbands, jazz ensembles\nand rock artistes\n| F with The Gro over sp Steel Orchestra, the Searchers( hands up\nwho remembers them!),\nHarvey and the Wall b angers and\nTerry Lightfoot and his band. There will\nbe free Hollywood films at the N FT plus free admission\nto the Hayward Gallery all day. The fun starts\nat 12noon and lasts\n'own& Out in London\ntill 10.30pm and is centred\naround the South Bank\nbetween Waterloo and\nWestminster Bridges, nearest\ntubes are Waterloo and Westminster.\n' hy is it that all the good\nevents are happening on the\nsame day? Another FREE\nevent on Saturday is Ska music on the Common which( surprise, surprise)\ntakes place on Clapham Common. Ska music flourished in the 1960s and enjoyed\na revival in the 1970s when\nTwo Tone brought out ska-style records by The Specials and Selector. Between 2 and\n8pm you will be treated to the\ndelights of Desmond Dek ker, the Del tones and Potato5 at the Bandstand.\nWhy not check out the Ska in\nthe afternoon and the fireworks in the evening?\n1 realised today why I gave up\ncommuting into College last\nyear when they cancelled my train. Something told me that\nit was going to be one of those\ndays \u2014 or nights. For those of\nyou who enjoy train travel then\nyour day is the13 th September when Network SouthEast( the same network that cancelled my\ntrain) has its annual Network Day. You can travel anywhere\nin the south east region for\nonly \u00a34 and if you hold onto the\nticket you can claim \u00a34 off of a Network Card\u2014for discount\ntravel all year. Personally I just\ncan't wait!\nL^ and of Hope and Glory....'\nOnce again it's Last Night of\nthe Proms time at the Royal\nAlbert Hall. It's the best sort of\njingoism if that' s your particular kind of perversion\n\u2014 all great fun. Remember to\nwear your Union Jack Yfronts though. The only\nsnag is that you have to ,\nprove that you've been\nto the Proms four times\nalready this year (so if you haven't been yet you better get\ngoing fast!) in order\nto secure a ticket for that\nperformance. Once the Proms have vacated the venue it's handed over to more ' modern' music. Everything But The Girl play there on October\n14th costing anything between\n\u00a36 and \u00a38 and sultry Suzanne Vega on November 17th&18 th for \u00a35-8. But the most\nexciting visitor has to be\nAlison Moyet on November\n19th&20 th. tickets are by\npost only from: Alison Moyet\nBox Office, PO Box 77,\nLondon SW4 9LS. Just slip in\n\u00a36-9 for you ticket plus 50p per\nticket booking fee and an SAE.\nCheques should be made\npayable to 'Alison Moyet Box\nOffice'. Is this girl shrewd or\nwhat?\n/ And still they keep on talking\nabout bringing Queen back\nfor an Imperial gig! Do you know that it costs \u00a310,000 to\nhire the Royal Albert Hall for\none night? I wonder how much Wembley Arena costs. Perhaps I should ask A J Jarre au next time I see him as\nhe's appearing there with\nGwen Guthrie on the 20th( \u00a310.50, \u00a39.50, \u00a38.50. Starts\n7.30pm). Actually there are\nquite a few good gigs around\nLondon this month. If you like\nhip-hop don't stop music then\nHammersmith Odeon entertains Full Force, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, The Real Roxanne, and DJ Cheese on2627 th September (\u00a37.50,\n\u00a36.50, \u00a35.50. Starts 7.30pm). I guess that the best one to\ncatch is the jump-jive outfit\nChevalier Brothers and Lino& theY ow City Expedition at Ronnie Scott's, Frith Street on21 st( \u00a35/\u00a35.50\nDoor. Starrs 8pm) or slightly\ncheaper at Ding uv a//s, Camden Lock tomorrow (\u00a34).\nAll tickets are available from\nthe usual agents.\nI 've always thought that\nLondon has more than its fair\nshare of exhibitions. Some even worth making an effort to\nsee. Most of us pass the Ismaili\nCentre every day but never\nbother to take a look inside. It\nhas an excellent gallery called\nZaman a within it and its\ncurrent exhibition is Centuries of Gold the\ncoinage of medieval islam.\nShow your Union Card and\nyou'll get in for 50p. Not your\ncup of tea? Well, the Hayward Gallery on the South Bank\nhas lots of rude photography\non show in its exhibition\n! Amour F ou. Catch it when\nyou visit on Thames day. The NationalMuseum of Art& Design( or the V&A to those\nmore familiar with its usual\ntitle) has Blitz Fashion until\nthe 28th with a multitude of\ndesigner Levi jackets on show.\nIt's up to you to whether you\nwant to pay the entrance fee or\nnot. The final one that caught\nmy eye was the Masonic Exhibition at Freemasons\nHall, 60 Great Queen Street.\nDesigned, so they tell me, to\n'tell Freemasonry's story to\npeople who are not Freemasons' \u2014 so that excludes\nhalf of the College hierarchy.\nAdmission is free.\n\n"
