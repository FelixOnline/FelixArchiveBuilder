Is this what masculinity is all about?\n\\\\ When you\u2019ve\ngot action heavy\nadventures, you\nget impossibly\nbulky and beefy\ncharacters \\\\\ncharacters with a \u2018shoot\nfirst and ask questions later\u2019\nmentality. It\u2019s understandable\nthat this is catering to the\nsomewhat aggressive nature\nthat resides in everyone, but\nat the same time it\u2019s doing a\nbrilliant job of painting a very\ngrim image of male nature\nand masculinity in general.\nI admit, these are games\nafter all, and it\u2019d be boring\nas heck if every conflict was\nresolved by talking it out. The\nissue is most games have very\nI\nn the olden times, the\nworld was in a very\ndifferent place. Just look\nat old stories and folktales to get an idea; they\nalways sprang out of\nthe aspirations and concerns\nof the time. After centuries\nof storytelling, it can get\npretty tricky to cut those\nbonds. Obviously, society has\nmassively evolved and moved\non from then, however video\ngames are still struggling to\ncatch up.\nEveryone knows female representation isn\u2019t exactly ideal\nin games, but the same is also\ntrue for men. Both physically\nand attitude-wise, we\u2019re\nalmost always given a one-di-mensional portrait of men in\nvideo games substitute brains\nfor brawn.\nGames are, first and\nforemost, a visual medium,\nand when you\u2019ve got action-heavy adventures, you get\nimpossibly bulky and beefy\ncharacters. Predominantly all\nmale characters are depicted\nthis way, as muscular and\nhulking. You could look at this\nas appealing to the gamer\nmindset, giving them an\nopportunity to be someone\nwith great physical prowess\nthat would take years of\neffort to obtain in real life.\nI, myself, don\u2019t find these\ndesigns personally threaten-ing, though it doesn\u2019t mean\nthat such representations\naren\u2019t downright silly and,\npotentially, prevent games\nfrom being treated seriously\nas an art form. Besides, men\naren\u2019t the only people who\nplay video games, so it\u2019s no\ngood having this unrealistic\nmasculinity portrayal as the\nstanding norm.\nEven more harmful than the\nappearance of these characters is their attitudes. A lot\nof characters have as much\npersonality as those created\nby Stephenie Meyer. It sort of\nmakes sense why characters\nare written this way; males\nhave traditionally been\nportrayed as destructive (just\nlook at history). However,\nit\u2019s one thing to beautifully\nportray the glory of physical\nhardship, it\u2019s quite another\nto use violence as a means\nof getting from one point to\nanother.\nThere are female characters with violent tendencies,\nfor sure. But it\u2019s so much\nmore common to see male\n\u201813-year old\u2019 thoughts of how\nmen resolve conflict. Also,\nwhen violence has no context\nor reason, or is the only way\nto go forward, things become\nproblematic.\nYet games are slowly\nbecoming more and more\nstory driven and with this\nbirths more complex characters who bring out different\nand more appealing sides\nof masculinity. For example,\nin the Mass Effect series, the\ncharacter of Shepard brings a\nlot of depth to the quintessential leader role as he deals\nwith the dichotomy of leader-ship: ruthlessness and nobility.\nBoth sides deal with the\nburden and eventual aftermath of choice. This caters to\na man\u2019s instinct to take charge\nand lead, not necessarily like\nan alpha male, but more so\nas someone in an influential\nand superior position.\nAnother character who\nhighlights a different side of\nmasculinity in video games\nis Nathan Drake from the\nUncharted series. This series\nreminds us that \u2018boys\u2019 know\nhow to do one thing very\nwell: have fun. Nathan Drake\nis vibrant, well dialogued,\nand a fun every-man, taking\nthe adventure from one stage\nto the next. Adventurous characters like him remind us that\nit\u2019s the journey, with trials and\nobstacles along the way, that\nmatter. It\u2019s man\u2019s nature to\njourney outward and explore;\nwhile this isn\u2019t much possible\nin modern society, films and\nvideo games help satiate this\nFallacies of masculinity in games\nthirst for adventure. While\nsome games may still have\nthe aforementioned faux that\ntarnishes the image of mascu-linity, games like Uncharted\nplay up the other features\nthat can appeal to us.\nGames have still a long way\nto go, especially compared to\nother forms of media. While\nat the end of the day, games\nare just simple fun, it can be\ndifficult to ignore the ways\nthey misrepresent men and\nmasculinity. It\u2019s inevitable that\ngames will grow with their\naudience, but until that time,\nit\u2019s best to praise and enjoy\nthe developers giving depth\nand complexity to male characters while ignoring the ones\nwho can\u2019t get their heads out\nof seventh grade.\n\\\\ Boys know how\nto do one thing very\nwell: have fun \\\\\nvideo games. While there are\nplenty of games out there that\nfeature mentally strong and\npsychologically deep male\ncharacters, the majority of\nMaster Chief, all fire power and no talk \\\\ Darwin Yamamoto\nSaad Ahmed\n\n"

Joanne Beale\nfrom Engineers Without\nBorders, in her talk \u2018Massive\nSmall Change in Mozambique\u2019 opens our eyes to the\nfact that doctors are not the\nonly ones saving lives directly\n\u2013 engineers are doing it too.\nJoanne spent two and a\nhalf years in Mozambique\non a project to ameliorate\nwater conditions. In a country where only 25% of the\npopulation has access to safe\nwater, 20% of children had\nconsistently been dying of\ndiarrhea before they reached\nthe age of five, a direct result\nof poor water conditions and\nlack of sanitation. Joanne set\nout with a simple mission: to\nreduce this child mortality\nrate by spreading information\non water sanitation, building\nwater wells and encouraging\nthe construction of latrines in\nevery house.\nJoanne took on volunteers\nfrom local communities and\neducated them on water\nsafety, aiming to reach every\nhousehold to maximize\nthe effect. Most locals had\nremarkably little knowledge\nabout water sanitation, with\ncommonplace methods of\npurification, including boil-ing, UV and chlorine being\nalmost unheard of. Only\n30% of the local population\nhad any access to latrines\nand common practices like\nhand-washing before meals\nwere scarcely practiced.\nJoanne\u2019s educational\nprogram revolutionized the\ncommunities she touched\nwithin just two years: 97%\nof all households targeted\nreceived aid, 75% of them\nhaving functional latrines at\nthe end of the program and\nwater purification techniques\nnow being widespread\namong 80% of the popu-lation. This has resulted in\nchild mortality being cut by\nmore than half, a figure that\nis expected to improve as\nthese measures reach more\ncommunities.\nWhat is truly remarkable\nis with how few resources\nand a virtually inexistent\ngovernment collaboration,\nthis was achieved. The only\npaid member of the project\nwas a single field worker who\nmanaged to train 15 local\nvolunteers, who themselves\nLife-saving engineering\nand experiences we are all\nalone; as Tennessee Williams\nput it, \u201cWe are all sentenced\nto solitary confinement inside\nour own skins, for life\u201d.\nDespite how scary and overwhelming this all may seem,\nthe fact that we can function\nand continue to question and\ndiscuss these matters at all is\nnothing short of incredible.\nWe as humans are unique\nin our ability to question, to\ndebate, to discuss. I can ask\nyou how an apple tastes,\nwhat pain feels like to you\nor what colour a strawberry\nis, but I will never be able to\nexperience any of it in the\nsame way you do. However,\nwe can continue to ask and\ndiscuss and hopefully, some-day, we will get there.\nC\nolour is an\nillusion. When\nwe look at any\nobject, likely\nthe first thing\nwe notice about\nit is its colour. Colours are\nincredibly important to our\nunderstanding of the world,\nand we use them all the time\nin art, film, photography,\nand in science. Despite all\nthis however, it is a fact that\ncolours do not exist in the\nexternal world. Colours are\nnot an intrinsic property of\nany material, rather they\nare the representation\nthat our minds produce of\nthe light given off by any\nobject. They do not exist\noutside of our minds and\nare simply our interpretation\nof a certain range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum;\nas such, it is impossible to\ndetect or measure how you,\nor in fact any other person,\nexperiences any colour.\nThis leads to an interesting\nand rather scary idea: the\nfact that different people\ncould perceive colours in\ncompletely different ways.\nFor instance, imagine you and\nI look at the same object, say\nan orange. I would see the\ncolour I think of as orange,\nbut you could see the colour I\nthink of as blue; however, we\nhave both been brought up to\nlabel that colour as \u201corange\u201d.\nSo when asked what colour\nthe orange is, we both answer\ncorrectly and say orange,\nbefore parting to go about\nour lives. But despite agreeing\non the colour, we have no\nidea how very different our\nexperiences of the same\nobject were.\nLet\u2019s say I met a man who\nwas born blind. He would\nhave never experienced\nseeing any colour, so I decide\nto teach him about colours,\nstarting with light. I start from\nthe fundamentals, such as its\nbasic properties like wave-length, frequency and speed,\nand work my way to the more\ncomplex, such as quantum\nmechanics. I could teach him\nevery single equation to do\nwith light. I could teach him\nthe optical and opto-elec-tronic properties of every\nsingle material; that is, how\nlight interacts with materials.\nI could teach him every single\ndescriptive word assigned to\nevery colour, and have him\nmemorise the exact range of\nwavelengths for each colour.\nI could even teach him every\nbiological process involved\nin how our eyes and brains\nprocess light, and how an\nimage or colour is formed in\nthe mind.\nBut he would never be able\nto actually see or experience\nany colour. I could tell him\nthat red was a hot, passionate\nand angry colour. I could say\nblue was cold, that green was\nthe colour of grass and blue\nthe colour of the sky. None of\nthis would matter. He would\nnever experience seeing\nany sort of colour, no matter\nhow I described it. No colour\nwould ever appear in his\nmind no matter what I said or\nhow I explained them to him.\nThese private, indescribable,\nraw feelings or experiences\nhave been termed \u2018qualia\u2019\nby philosophers, and we\nseem to be utterly incapable\nof expressing or explaining\nthem. This could be because\nour languages are unable\nto produce these qualia in\nother people\u2019s minds; and\ngiven time and advances in\nlanguage and technology, we\ncould be able to accurately\ndescribe a raw feeling and\nhave another person experience that same feeling.\nQualia, such as our perceptions of colour, cannot\nbe measured with any tests\nwe devise. Other conditions,\nsuch as colour blindness, are\ndifferent in that they cause\nreal-world effects in the\npeople affected. People with\ncolour blindness fail to see\nthings or differentiate colours\nin a way that most people\ncan, so they can be tested\nand diagnosed. However,\nthere could very easily be\nmany different ways of seeing\nand experiencing colours,\nwhich do not alter a person\u2019s\nbehaviour or performance\nin any tests we could devise.\nIn that case, there would be\npeople who prefer certain\ncolours or prefer certain\ncolour combinations, which\nindeed currently happens.\nThis is extremely important,\nas it shows that we can never\ntruly understand what any\nother person experiences,\nshort of crawling into their\nsubconscious and experiencing things from their\nperspective first-hand. When\nit comes to our perceptions\nQasim Mahmood examines the science behind seeing\ncolours, and why experiencing them may be visually\ndifferent for everyone\nDoallcolourslookthesame?\n\\\\ Colours do not\nexist outside of our\nminds, they are\nsimply our interpretation of a certain\nrange of the electromagnetic spec-trum. It\u2019s therefore\nimpossible to detect\nor measure how\nanyone experiences\nthem \\\\\n\\\\ We are all\nsentenced to solitary\nconfinement within\nour own skins, for\nlife \\\\\n\\\\ We can never\ntruly understand\nanother person\u2019s\nexperiences \\\\\nSara Hamilton reviews how \u2018Massive Small Change\u2019 speaker Joanna Beale inspires others to\nmake a difference by improving sanitation in Mozambique\ntrained 20 counsellors each,\nwho succeeded in reaching\nout to 440,000 people.\nJoanne also expressed her\njoy at the willingness of\nlocals to cooperate, with\napplications for volunteering\npositions from people with\nwhom she did not even share\na common language swarming at her door.\nSo next time you think\nabout your careers prospects\nperhaps consider, just for a\nsecond, the millions of communities that could use your\ntechnological and scientific\nknowledge to empower\nthem. They might just need it\na tiny bit more than the stock\nexchange market does.\n//renatodantasc\nsolar, nanotech-powered\nclothing. The study, published\nonly days ago in Nature\nCommunications, has successfully weaved solar powered\nfilaments into textiles. This\ncomes from Associate Professor of nanotechnology Javan\nThomas, who mentioned Back\nto the Future was a major\ninspiration for him to \u201crealise\nthose cinematic fantasies\u201d.\nThe research builds upon\nprevious work conducted by\nMr. Thomas and his associ-ates, where they developed\na cable not only capable\nof transmitting energy, but\nalso storing it, rather than\nrequiring a grid or battery.\nThe team developed thin, flexible and lightweight copper\nribbons, which are split\ninto two layers: one energy\nstoring layer; one solar cell\nlayer. Their groundbreaking achievement removes a\nmajor limitation to solar cell\nportability, as the energy\nflowing through them has\nalways required a battery for\nstorage. The proof-of-concept\nwas demonstrated using a\ntabletop loom and a bit of\nyarn.\nMr. Thomas\u2019s work is likely\nto revolutionize wearable\ntechnology so far as allowing\nus to charge our phones and\nother gadgets with jackets or\ncoats by simply \u201csliding them\nin a pocket\u201d. Furthermore,\nmilitary applications would\nbe especially promising,\nparticularly for soldiers\nstationed in desert climates.\nThese men must often trek\nfor days and carry up to 30\npounds of batteries on their\nbacks, which isn\u2019t easy, even\nin a calm, safe environment.\nOther potential uses for this\nnovel technology include cars\nthat could function on solar\nenergy, store that energy and\nre-charge themselves so long\nas there is sunlight.\n\n"

How\ndoes Netflix\u2019s modernisation\nof the iconic Voltron franchise\nhold up?\nU\npon first hearing\nof the Voltron\nreboot, I was\nsceptical. The\nfocus of the show\nwas to be on\ngiant flying robotic lions that\ncould combine together to\nform an even larger robot. It\nmade me think that it would\nbe a lesser version of a\nTransformers/Power Rangers\nmash-up. Two things made me\ndecide to give it the benefit\nof the doubt. One was the\nfact that it was on Netflix,\nwhich has yet to disappoint\nwith any of its original shows.\nThe other was the fact that\nthe creators of the beloved\nAvatar shows (Legends of\nAang and Korra) were the\nshow runners. I\u2019m happy to\nsay that my expectations\nwere blown straight out of\nthe gate and that I\u2019m now a\nVoltron fan.\nThe concept of Voltron is\nundeniably cheesy but the\nshow\u2019s so cleverly written\nthat it feels more like a\nnatural part of the plot than\na gimmick. The overarching\nstoryline is pretty standard; a\ngroup of young heroes come\ntogether through a series\nof events and are chosen to\nbe the pilots or paladins of\nthe Voltron lions. Their task\nis to be the protectors of the\nUniverse, with season 1 specifically focusing on the evil\nGalra Empire.\nThe series is well structured\nand tightly paced. Honestly,\nit feels more like one big\nmovie than a show of several\nepisodes. This makes it ideal\nfor binge watching of course,\nthough it may seem as if it\u2019s\nover all too soon. The energy\nand action blend smoothly\ntogether, making you crave\nthe next installment. The\nanime-ish art style and\ncombination of cel-shading\nand traditional hand-drawn\nTV comes neatly together to\nmake a work of art.\nHaving said that, some\nparts of the show are a little\ngeneric and tropey. You have\nthe standard coming together\nas a team, everyone gets\nseparated, and then they\nget betrayed by a seemingly\nfriendly person. Then again,\na lot of things these days\nare pretty tropey (*cough*\nStranger Things *cough*) and\nas long as the execution\u2019s spot\non (which it definitely is for\nVoltron!), it can be forgiven.\nIf tropes are something you\nactively despise, this show\nmay not be the one for you.\nAesthetically, there are\na number of similarities\nbetween this show and the\nAvatar shows. This is not\nsurprising given they share\nmany showrunners. It\u2019s not\njust the animation style and\naction sequences, even some\nof the jokes are in a similar\nvein. Of course, this is brilliant\nnews for anybody who was\na fan of either Avatar, and\ndesperately needs something\nto fill the void. While some of\nthe jokes can get a little bit\ncringey at times, it never feels\nlike too much and is always in\na fair balance.\nThe main characters are\nalso enjoyable and well writ-ten. Initially they come across\nas the usual generic heroes\nyou would expect. However,\nwith each episode, you learn\nmore about their back-stories,\nquirks and traits; ultimately\nyou end up rooting for all\nof them. Each pair-up and\nadventure brings out different\nsides of the characters and it\n\\\\ The energy\nand action blends\nsmoothly together,\nmaking you crave\nthe next instalment \\\\\nThey look like competent \u2018heroes\u2019 \\\\ Netflix\nHis acting is a bit robotic, to be honest\n\\\\ Netflix\ncan be both endearing and\nhumorous to see the different\npersonalities interact with\neach other.\nUnfortunately, the same\ncannot be said for the antagonists who are the series\u2019\nweak point. The Galra Empire\nserve as the season\u2019s villains,\nbasically being the heroes\u2019\npunching bags either directly\nor indirectly. They\u2019re portrayed as a typical alien race,\nbent on having the ultimate\nweapon and conquering the\ngalaxy. They are never given\nmotivations beyond this and\nare never shown any depth or\ngiven any development; basically they\u2019re ripped straight\nfrom the Marvel movies. It\nfeels like their entire race\nconsists of serious, angry war\ngenerals, making you wonder\nwhy they haven\u2019t eradicated\nthemselves from in-fighting.\nIn the grand scheme of\nthings, this is a small point,\nwhich in no way detracts from\neverything else. I\u2019m not sure\nhow similar or dissimilar it\nmay be to the older Voltron\nshows, but this version is\nwithout a doubt an epic,\ncolourful, and funny take on a\nclassic 80\u2019s series. In a world\nwhere things are becoming\nincreasingly dark and gritty,\nit\u2019s a welcome change of\npace to see Voltron: Legendary Defender embrace its\ngoofy and outlandish roots\nwhile being an epic adventure in its own right.\n\n"

This\nis the cycle, the torment, in\nwhich many gay Palestinian\nmen live in today. Escape,\nhide, capture, return, repeat\nuntil death.\nDirector Yariv Mozer\u2019s Invisible Men, offers a raw insight\ninto the lives of some of these\nmen, who have committed\nno crime except to love those\nwho their society has deemed\nunfit. It unapologetically\nshows the struggles these\nmen face, the torture \u2013 literal\nas well as emotional \u2013 they\nhave been through and the\ntorture they face. Their lives\nare at such risk that the only\nway they are guaranteed to\nsurvive is through applying\nfor asylum outside of Israel.\nThe administration involved,\ncompounded with their unsubstantiated belief that they\nwill not succeed, as well as\nplain reluctance to leave their\nhomeland serve as major\ndeterrents for many men.

However, the move\nthat will catalyse it is how\nmasculinity (and femininity) is\nviewed worldwide. The mind-sets of numerous families,\ncommunities, and countries\nneed to be changed about\nthese issues. The view that\nthe LGBT community partake\nin something \u2018dishonorable\u2019\nneeds to be scrapped. And\nfilms like this are necessary\nin raising awareness to our\ngeneration, the ones who\ncan further change about\nsuch problems around\nthe world.

The complications\nof shooting the film were\nnumerous: Yariv described\nhow he always had to stay\na good distance behind the\nmen whilst shooting in public,\nfor their safety. However,\nbeing filmed by a Israeli crew\nalso gave the men a shield;\nthey felt like they belonged\nin the Israeli community, and\nhence felt safe.

It must have been\na daunting proposition.\nAssembling the definitive\nlife story of the world\u2019s most\nfamous film critic is certainly\nnot an easy task. It makes\nme therefore happy to\nreport, that James ultimately\nsucceeded in producing a\nbiography with subtlety,\nsincerity and an undeniable\nintelligence.\nOverall, it was an interesting\nexperience watching this film\nas I was only vaguely aware\nof Roger Ebert\u2019s work. I knew\nwho he was but, I suppose\nnot living in America or being\nalive whilst his show was on\ntelevision, I was never really\naware of the cultural juggernaut he was. I certainly had\nno idea about the intricacies\nof his character and personal\nlife which James explores\nand presents so well here.\nProducing comprehensive\nbiographical documentaries\ncan often be hard. After\nall, any person one wishes\nto study is a complex being\nwith opinions, characteristics,\nbiases, likes and dislikes all\nworking together. Where Life\nItself succeeded was in leaving me with the feeling that\nI really got to know Ebert. I\nalso liked how the filmmakers\nwere not afraid to include\nsome of the less glamorous\naspects of Ebert\u2019s life, from\nhis alcoholism to his ego. But,\nwhereas other directors often\npresent topics like these in a\nmanipulatively melancholic\nway, James understood that\nthese were human flaws\nand presented them with the\nnuance and complexity that\nshould be expected when\ntelling a deeply personal life\nstory. The way Asif Kapadia\nhandled Amy Winehouse\u2019s\nlife story in Amy is another\nexample of this done well.\nThere were a few things\nI think the film was missing\nhowever. His love for film was\nmade clear but I never got a\nsense of his opinions or which\nfilms he liked or disliked, and\nfor what reason. Which films\naffected him the most? What\nphilosophies does he spell\nout in the way that he writes\nabout them? On top of this,\nI also really wanted to know\nwhat made Ebert better than\nthe average reviewer on\nRotten Tomatoes. There were\nalso a few parts of the film\nwhich felt slightly pointless, at\nleast to the wider narrative.\nThe section on the Cannes\nfilm festival is an example\nof a part of the film which\ndidn\u2019t really go anywhere or\nprovide interesting insight.\nI would understand if other\npeople disagree with me on\nthis though. Overall, I commend the filmmakers for being\nrestrained in their runtime and\nnot letting everything drag\non for too long. It\u2019s definitely\na pitfall for a lot of similar\nbiographical films, Scorsese\u2019s\nMarley is one example. All\nthis adds up to a biographical film which works in every\nway it should. I should think\nEbert would be very happy to\nadd this documentary to his\nlegacy.\nBenjamin Collier\n\\\\ Assembling the\ndefinitive life story\nof the world\u2019s most\nfamous film critic\nis certainly not an\neasy task \\\\\nThe Invisible Men \\\\ Mozer Films\nYariv Mozer \\\\ WikiCommons\n\n"

The\nterms might be joking; the\nprinciples behind them are\nnot; emotional constipation,\ntestosterone fuelled posturing,\nand (violent) aggression form\nthe basis of what sociologists\ncall \"hegemonic masculinity\",\nin other words, the socially\nacceptable heteromasculinity\nof gunslinging cowboys from\nmid century Westerns. Male\nballet dancers do not easily\nfit into this narrative, whether\nthey have ripped abs or not.\nBallet, in the eyes of many\nhas resolutely fallen into\nthe category of \u201csissy stuff\u201d;\n\"prancing princes\" is how the\ncritic Andrew Bland described\nclassical male dancers in\n1960. Sadly, the dogwhistle\nhomophobia in Bland\u2019s term\nand ones like it have not\nstayed relegated to the 60s.\nIn 2003, a sociological study\nof male ballet dancers found\nthat homophobic slurs were\nstill used to describe male\ndancers and their work. The\nalmost superhuman athletic\nfeats that might\u2019ve earned\nthis cohort of real life Billy\nElliots acclaim from the Reddit\ncrowd had they taken place\non a field, or a track, become\nthe focus of derision when\nthey take place on stage.\nWhy is this the case? Some\nhave argued that while\nconventional athletics is\nabout action to achieve a\ngoal, dance is action for it\u2019s\nown sake, for the sake of\nbeing seen. To be on display,\nto become an object of the\nfemale gaze is a threat to the\nconventional ideas of mascu-linity. For some, women are\nmuch more suited to the role\nof object; it\u2019s no coincidence\nthat figures in music-boxes,\ntiny figures spinning on cue\nare cast as ballerinas. These\npresumptions on a woman\u2019s\nability disregards the blood\nand sweat that make up the\nperformances of real life bal-lerinas, in favour of the tautly\nheld postures, and the tulle\nof their tutus. How to fit men\ninto this narrative though?\nThroughout history, male\ndancers have been under\npressure to embrace effeminacy (and to some degree the\nassumption of homosexuality\nthat comes along with this) or\nutterly reject it in a display of\nover the top machismo.\nMatthew Bourne\u2019s Swan\nLake attempts to subverts\nexpectations to encompass\nflapping their arms menacingly trying to intimidate each\nother rather than performing\nin harmony. This is a display\nof hegemonic masculinity, of\npower, not aestheticism. The\nmovements are exaggerated,\ndiscordant with the familiar\nmusic, it\u2019s meant to be at\nleast a little funny - a send up\nof how gung-ho masculinity\nlooks in this scenario.\nIt would\u2019ve been easy for\nthe whole production to\ndescend into parody, but\nBourne\u2019s Swan Lake remains\na story of tortured love.\nThe prince is revealed to be\ncloseted, visions of men haunt\nhim; in the opening scene, he\nstarts awake from a dream\nabout a strangely alluring\nman. Later on in the first act,\non a night out in a club full of\nsailors, the prince\u2019s dances,\nthus far subdued, become\nsexually charged. It is not\nmeant to be; the night ends in\na physical altercation which\nleaves Siegfied bruised and\nbloody on the pavement. He\nis rebuffed by his mother, and\nthe woman he was seeing\nis revealed to be on the\npayroll of the evil Secretary\nwho is seeking influence at\nthe palace. Despondent,\nDeconstructingthemythof 'prancingprinces'\nIndira Mallik\n\\\\ Bourne\u2019s Swan\nLake is a tender\ndepiction of a\nclosested man \\\\\nboth. In the original Swan\nLake, a Tchaikovsky classic,\nSiegfried, a prince who is\nbeing married off by the\nQueen against his will, falls\nin love with Odette, a girl\nwho is cursed to be a swan\nby day. Only true love will\nlift the curse cast by the evil\nVon Rothbart. Swan Lake is\none of the few ballets that\nhave taken root in the public\nconsciousness. Rarely do new\ndirectors attempt any sort of\nmajor revision to the tried and\ntested format of the 19th\ncentury original. It was perhaps\nMatthew Bourne\u2019s inexperience with ballet that allowed\nhim the boldness to reimagine\nSwan Lake as a love story\nbetween two male leads.\nIn the Bourne staging, first\nperformed in 1995 in Sadler\u2019s\nWells, the swans, traditionally\na corps of female dancers\nare replaced by bare chested\nmale dancers in feathered\nhose, faces done up in\nwar-paint like black make\nup. Bourne has said he was\ninspired by the \"aggressive,\nmuscular\" side of swans; the\nviciousness that belie their\nserene exteriors. One of the\nmost iconic sequences from\nthe original is the dance of\nthe little swans. In this pas\nde quatre, four (female)\ndancers, arms linked, perform\na piece of devilishly difficult\nsynchronised choreography.\nIn the Bourne version, the\nperformance sheds its veneer\nof order; instead of restrained\nsteps in synch, the dancers perform daring leaps,\nthe prince stumbles into a\ndeserted park, where he\nmeets the Swan King.\nThe performance by the\ndancer in the role of the Swan\nKing is by turns menacing\nand sensual. He radiates a\ncertain wildness in his solo\nperformances. However, the\npas de deux between the\nprince and the Swan King\nare tender, loving. If the\ndance of the little swans is\nplayed for laughs, this central\nrelationship is thankfully,\nnot. Matthew Bourne has\nsaid depicting a romantic\nrelationship between the\nSwan King and the prince\nwas not his \u2018explicit intention\u2019,\nbut the homoeroticism is fairly\nevident. In this production,\nthe characterisation of male\nballet dancers comes full\ncircle; rather than rejecting the associations with\nhomosexuality, Swan Lake\nreclaims it. In doing so, it\ncreates a far richer, far truer,\nand most importantly, a far\nmore interesting depiction of\nmasculinity.\n\\\\ Dogwhistle\nhomophobia has not\nstayed relagated to\nthe 60s when\nreferring to male\nballet dancers \\\\\n\\\\ Michel e Carla\nA\ns Oreste\nstarted, I\nthought for\na fleeting\nmoment that\nI was in the\nwrong place. Had I gotten\nlost among the twisting\nalleyways of East London?\nWhy was a mascara-streaked,\nhammer-wielding teenage girl\nbutchering a hapless prisoner\non stage?\nThen the orchestra struck\nup the opening chords, and\nI realised that said girl was\nmeant to be Ifigenia. In\nHandel\u2019s original (though\noriginal is a bit of a misnomer,\nOreste is a pastiche of music\ncobbled together from earlier\nworks), Ifigenia is the unwilling priestess of Diana on the\nisland of Tauris, forced to\nritually sacrifice all those who\nland on King Toante\u2019s shores.\nHer long-estranged brother\nOreste, driven mad by the\nFuries for murdering his\nmother, wanders the world in\nsearch of relief and is washed\nup on Tauris. Ifigenia tries\nto help him escape from the\nisland with the aid of Filotete\n\u2013 the captain of the guards\nwho has fallen in love with\nher. This plan is complicated\nby the capture of Oreste\u2019s\nwife Ermione, and his faithful\nfriend Pilade who have come\nto Tauris in search of him.\nBefore I had quite recovered from the initial shock of\nseeing the temple of Diana\nrepresented by a slaughterhouse (complete with a\ngenerous splash of blood\nfrom the latest sacrificial\nvictim), Oreste himself shuffled into view. Dressed in\ntatty pyjamas and picking\nvacantly at his shirt hem, he\nlooked more an escapee from\na mental asylum than the tortured \u201cman of noble descent\u201d\nthat Ifigenia proclaimed him\nto be. But then he opened his\nmouth to sing, and what a\ncontrast! On that gritty, graffi-ti-ridden stage, after the gore\nand horror of the opening\nscenes, Angela Simkin\u2019s voice\nwas unexpectedly beautiful.\nThe more I watched, the\nmore mystified I became.\nDirector Gerard Jones\u2019\nproduction of Oreste is\nintentionally ugly and\nstripped-down, devoid of the\nniceties of classicalism. There\nis nothing sacred about ritual\nsacrifice in Jones\u2019 vision of\nTauris \u2013 only madness and\nhorror. I soon came to the\nconclusion that everyone\nwas insane; except perhaps\nPilade, a lone figure of normalcy in a cast of deranged\ncharacters.\nDespite my preference for a\nclassical style, the modernity of the production was\nnot what perturbed me. As\na Beckett-esque absurdist\ntheatre unfolded on stage, the\nsoaring notes and romantic\nlyrics seemed to be from a different production entirely. \u201cO\n\\\\ As a\nBeckett-esque\nabsurdist theatre\nunfolded on stage,\nthe soaring notes\nand romantic lyrics\nseemed to be from\na different\nproduction entirely.\n\\\\\nIs this even the\nright theatre? |\nOreste\ndisappoints\nClaire Chan\nOreste is on at the Royal Opera\nHouseuntil19th November2017\n.\nStart time: 7\n.30 pm\nRuntime : 170 minutes\nGritty, and stripped down: Oreste at\nthe ROH \\\\ Clive Barda\nfairest eyes of my beloved\u2026\nFor you I shall suffer the joys\nand ills of Fate!\u201d \u2013 How could\nI believe that, coming from a\nslavering Filotete who leered\nafter Ifigenia at every oppor-tunity? Jones might have been\ngoing for dissonance, but it\njust did not work.\nOreste is a long, three-act\nopera, and the ROH made\nthe unfortunate decision to\nrun the first two acts together.\nBy the end of the second act,\nI had grown quite weary of\nthe characters. Nothing made\nany sense. Vacuous, twitchy\nOreste failed to inspire in me\nany admiration or reason\nto believe why the other\ncharacters were so willing to\nlay down their lives for him.\nWhen the reunited Oreste\nand Ermione sang their\npassionate \u201cAh mia cara\u201d\nduet at each other with an\nutter lack of emotion, it was\njust too much. I closed my\neyes. That certainly improved\nthe performance; the lovely\nvoices of Angela Simkin and\nVlada Borovko carried me\n\\\\ Had I gotten lost\namong the twisting\nalleyways of East\nLondon? \\\\\naway.\nAt least the denouement,\nwith its final twist, managed\nto explain the peculiar actions\nof the characters in the first\ntwo acts \u2013 but the belated\nrealisation that it was all\nintentional was too little, too\nlate. Hilariously, Pilade gave\nup on the lunacy surrounding\nhim, donned his lifejacket and\nslipped quietly away in the\nlast scene. Presumably he was\noff to a saner island.\nDespite the somewhat\nmisguided production, the\ntalent of the singers managed\nto shine through. Oreste is the\nROH\u2019s annual production of\nthe Jette Parker Young Artists\nprogramme, and there was\nno small amount of talent\nshowcased on stage that\nnight. Angela Simkin (Oreste)\n\\\\ This production\nis intentionally\nugly and stripped-downdevoid of the\nniceties of\nclassicicm \\\\\nand Jennifer Davis (Ifigenia)\nstood out for me especially,\naccompanied by the very\ncompetent Southbank Sinfonia under conductor James\nHendry.\nIf Gerard Jones is aiming to\nshock audiences with his postmodern production of Oreste,\nhe certainly managed to do\nso. I\u2019m not very sure what else\nhe managed to achieve.\n\n"

I gasped and stood up\nfrom my chair in excitement,\ncatching awkward stares\naround the library and\nworried glances from my\nlab partners, thinking I had\ngone mad from the endless\nliterature search.\nIn case you were wonder-ing, Dominique Ansel is a\nFrench-born pastry chef and\nowner of the Dominique Ansel\nBakery in New York, Tokyo,\nand finally, finally, finally in\nLondon in September. He\nshot to fame with his many\nsignature creations, including\nthe Cronut\u00ae, the Cookie\nShot and the Frozen S\u2019mores,\nforming 2-hour long queues\noutside his Tokyo branch\nevery day just for a flake of\nthat Cronut delicious-ness.\nAfter a sleepless night in\nanticipation, I marched to the\nWaterloo at 8:45 the next\nmorning in the freshest grey\nsweater in my wardrobe, a\nheart pumping with adrenaline and, of course, an empty\nstomach. I was led to a bar\nbeside the London Eye where\nI was fed champagne (yes,\nchampagne), business cards\nfrom fellow bloggers and\nDominique Ansel\u2019s chocolate\nmousse, fresh from the bakery\nin Belgravia, served on silver\nplastic spoons. I was sent\nto the London Eye some 20\nminutes later with a group of\n15-or-so bloggers, all almost\nskipping with happiness as we\nreached the capsule.\nIt took a bit of pushing and\nshoving to get everyone into\nthe moving capsule. But no\none was bothered as we were\ngreeted with a beautifully\ndecorated capsule, with the\nbright September morning\nsunshine and Dominique\nAnsel himself, grinning to us\nfrom the back of the capsule\nwith no sign of tiredness\nwhatsoever from the last two\nrounds of breakfast.\nIn the center was a table\nwith a white- striped table\ncloth, yellow flowers and\nwhite wicker baskets presenting some of Dominique\nAnsel\u2019s best creations: the\nCronut\u00ae, Welsh Rarebit crois-sant, the DKA, the Eton Mess\nLunchbox and the Salted\nHoney Tart.\nDominique waited patiently\nbefore stealing the spotlight\nfrom his creations back to\nhimself. He gave a brief introduction of himself, his bakery\nand the pastries on the table,\npassing around a basket of\nDKA\u2019s while he spoke. The\nDKA, Dominique\u2019s Kouign\nAmann (one of his signature\nitems), was a small Breton\npastry with a crispy, caramelized crust on the outside and\na flaky, buttery crumb within.\nWe were halfway up looking over the glorious morning\nview of the whole of London\nwhen the feast started. Hands\nfrantically grabbed the\npastries, clearing a quarter\nof the table in 30 seconds.\nI bit into the salted caramel\nand cocoa nib Cronut\u00ae, the\nflavour of the month. My\nstandards set by the several\nCookie Shot. On the small\nwhite squared dish was a\nchocolate chip cookie in the\nshape of a shot glass with a\ncoating of dark chocolate\ninside. By the side was a jug\nof cold, sweet, vanilla-infused\nmilk, poured into the crunchy-and-soft cookie cups, filling\nto the brim. This delightful\npiece of kitchen engineering\nis available across all his\nbakeries from 3 pm on the\ndot, right in time for a child\u2019s\nafter-school snack.\nWhile I was sipping the milk\nfrom my cookie, a pair of\nbloggers next to me located\ntheir hands on an Eton Mess\nLunchbox, Dominique\u2019s take\non the British dessert. Inspired\nby Korean lunchboxes, the\nclear plastic boxes were\nfilled with black pepper mini\nmeringues, \u201cstrawberries\nmade of mousse and jam,\nChristy Lam\nCronut dupes that have inhabited London since the Cronut\ncraze was instantly thrown\naway by the real deal. It\nwas exceptional. The pastry\nitself, with a coat of sugar\non the outside and a ring of\nicing on top, was incredibly\nlight, with clear layers of\nthin, flaky pastry revealing a\nvelvety salted caramel cream\nin the center. We were overwhelmed by the explosion of\nsenses, aided by the level of\nexcitement in the capsule, and\nnodded to each other with\nwide, glistening eyes.\nI grabbed my next target\nwhich I\u2019ve been drooling over\nfor years on Instagram \u2013 the\nsession ended as we were\napproaching the base. Wait!\nWhat about the leftovers?\nDominique had us covered\nby distributing around bright\norange takeaway boxes,\nwhich we all filled up with the\nleftover treats to our hearts\ndesires.

This\nphenomenon, known as\npresbyopia, is brought\nabout by the hardening of\nthe lens and weakening of\nthe muscles around it over\ntime. Many explanations\nfor this deterioration\nare founded by popular\nopinion, with most blaming\nthe evils of technology\nin one way or another.\nHowever, new research\nindicating that humans are\nnot alone in this problem\ncan, perhaps, debunk these\nideas. Researchers at Kyoto\nUniversity noticed how a\nsenior male bonobo called\n\u2018Ten\u2019 was staying a noticeable\ndistance away from a\nfellow troop member as he\ngroomed them, appearing to\nrequire this distance to see\nlice in their fur. This simple\nobservation prompted a\nlarger study involving the\nanalysis of a decade\u2019s worth\nof behavioural footage of the\ngrooming patterns of bonobo\nchimps in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo. The results\nRyu explains, the relative\ncohesiveness and gregariousness of bonobo assemblages\nmeans that, for the most part,\n\u201cold bonobos can just follow\nthe younger individuals\u201d.\nThis research also has\nseveral implications for\nhumans, with the authors\nsuggesting that we could\nnow investigate how other\ntissues senesce in bonobos in\ncomparison to humans and\nwhether this could explain\nwhy humans live so much\nlonger. Ultimately, it seems\nthat progressively worsening eye-sight is down to an\nunavoidable throwback to the\ncommon ancestors we share\nwith these great apes. In any\nrespect, at least it\u2019s not solely\ndue to staring at computer\nscreens all day, regardless of\nwhat our grandmothers may\nsay.\nof this study showed that,\nwhereas younger bonobos\n(<30 years) tended to focus\nat around 10cm, individuals\nwho were 40+ had to move\nover 20cm away to groom\nproperly.\nUnfortunately, this deterioration in the bonobos\u2019 eyesight\nlikely implicates serious\nconsequences in their social\nstanding and even survival.\nOlder bonobo males are\noften among the least popular grooming partners and\nthis is seemingly the result of\ntheir eyesight-induced inability to hold up their half of the\nmutualistic practice of groom-ing. Moreover, in the dark\nCongolese rainforests, far\nsightedness could also lead to\nproblems with navigation and\nthe spotting of human hunters.\nHowever, as head researcher\nof this project Dr. Heunglin\nDo old bonobos need to go to specsavers?\nW\nhy do\nwe find\nsome\npeople\nmore\nattractive than others?\nQualities such as a sense of\nhumour, good looks, and\nhonesty are often considered\nattractive. However, you\nmay be surprised to discover\nthat your immune system\ninfluences your choice of\npartner.\nThe immune system is the\nseries of molecular mechanisms that defend against\ninvading parasites. But what\ndoes this have to do with\nattractiveness? Attractive\nindividuals are said to possess\n\u2018good genes\u2019 that affect the\nimmune system in a way that\npromotes health. These genes\nare detectable and can be\npassed on to offspring.\nSo, what do good genes\nlook like? The \u2018handicap principle\u2019 suggests that signals\nwhich put the signaller at a\ndisadvantage are reliable.\nTestosterone is an important\nmale sex hormone which\npromotes the growth of\nornaments in animals but also\nreduces immune cell activity.\nfewer bouts of ill health and\nalso father more offspring.\nSymmetry is also a good\nindicator of genetic quality,\nrepresenting an ability to\nbuffer against environmental\ndisturbance. Men and women\nconsistently rate increasingly\nsymmetrical faces as more\nattractive.\nBeauty may even be in\nthe health of the beholder.\nWomen who have suffered\nfrom childhood illness have a\nstronger preference for more\nmasculine male faces. This\npreference is even stronger\nin individuals with poorer\ncurrent health.\nThe \u2018complementary genes\nhypothesis\u2019 suggests that individuals will be most attracted\nto mates with maximally\ndifferent immune systems.\nThe major histocompatibility\ncomplex (MHC) is part of\nthe immune system \u2013 MHC\nmolecules bind to infectious\npathogens, initiating an\nimmune response. Partners\nwith dissimilar MHCs will produce offspring with a diverse\narray of MHC molecules, providing defence against many\ndifferent pathogens. Females\nare able to recognize the\ndegree of dissimilarity of a\npotential partner\u2019s MHC using\nodour. Women scent-rated\nmen\u2019s t-shirts as being more\nattractive if the wearer had\na dissimilar MHC. Opposites\nreally do attract.\nTherefore, costly ornaments,\nsuch as a peacock\u2019s tail, can\nonly be maintained by healthy\nindividuals. The \u2018immunocompetence handicap hypothesis\u2019\nsuggests that animals showcase their good genes through\nornaments that represent their\nability to cope with parasites.\nIn humans, potential good\ngene indicators are facial\nmasculinity and symmetry.\nTestosterone promotes a typically masculine appearance,\nincluding a wide face with\na strong jaw and prominent\nbrow ridges. There is mixed\nevidence as to whether women\nreally prefer masculine faces.\nBut are \u2018masculine men\u2019\nhealthier? Studies have shown\nthat masculine men report\nMasculinity vs. Attractiveness\nThe(alphas)andomegasof food\nF\nact: \u2018Brain freeze\u2019\nhas a biological\nexplanation.\nIt even has an\nunpronounceable\nname: sphenopala-tine ganglioneuralgia. When\nsomething very cold touches\nthe roof of your mouth (called\nthe \u2018palate\u2019), it rapidly cools\nthe blood in the small blood\nvessels around your sinuses.\nThis causes them to constrict,\nand then to rapidly dilate\nagain when the blood warms\nup again (which happens\nwhen you stop necking ice\ncream to take a breath).\nPain receptors in your mouth\ndetect this relaxation of the\nblood vessels, but due to\nsomething called \u2018referred\npain\u2019, it feels like the pain\ncomes from your forehead,\neven though the signals\noriginated in the roof of your\nmouth. This is because the\nsame nerve carries signals for\nfacial pain and palate pain,\nand because you\u2019re just more\nused to being slapped in the\nface than in the roof of your\nmouth you assign this pain to\nyour forehead as a force of\nhabit.\nResearching brain freeze\nmight seem pointless, but\nscientists actually use it as a\nmodel for other headaches\nthat are not understood as\nwell, such as migraines, so\nsomewhere out there there\u2019s\nprobably a scientist that will\npay you to eat ice cream\nas fast as possible. Time to\nsack off those consultancy\napplications.\nBrain\nFreeze\nSophie Protheroe discusses how nature has shaped our taste in men\nAlexandra Lim explains the important differences between omega-3 and\nomega-6 fatty acids, and why we should be controlling our intake of both.\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\n@BitesOfScience\n// The millions we\nspend nowadays on\naspirin, ibruprofen,\nand paracetomol\nis money spent to\nundo the effects of\ntoo much omega-6\nand too little ome-ga-3 in the diet //\nNowadays, an oversupply of macronutrients (fat,\ncarbohydrates and protein)\ncontributes to the increase\nin obesity and diabetes.\nHowever, many overlook the\nsignificance of the severe\nlack of micronutrients. This\nis just as bad. The problem\nis that we\u2019re eating more\nseeds than leaves, and it\u2019s\nthe leaves which compress\nall the healthy treasures our\nbodies thrive on: antioxidants,\nphytochemicals, and omega-3. Most people associate\nomega-3 with fish only, but\nfish feed on algae which is\nwhere the most common fat\nin nature, alpha-linolenic\nacid (ALA), originates. So\nhow does omega-3 link to\ndiabetes? Since omega-3\nmakes cell membranes more\npermeable, cells are also\nmore sensitive to insulin,\nthat chemical that regulates\nfat storage. This means an\nomega-3 rich diet could help\nto protect against obesity.\nI\u2019m not saying seeds are all\nthat bad. In fact, they boast a\nwhole host of health benefits.\nFor example, sunflower seeds\nare rich in B vitamins that\nnourish your nervous system\nand bones. However, these\nguys are rich in omega-6 fatty\nacids, which are involved in\nfat storage rather than neurological development, glucose\nmetabolism, and inflammation\ncalming. Since the two types\nof fatty acids compete with\neach other for enzymes and\nspace in our cell membranes,\nthe actual ratio of omega-6\nand omega-3 matters more\nthan we think. Replacing\nthe recommended omega-3\namounts with omega-6 can\nbe hazardous to health. The\nmost surprising statistic in\nPollan\u2019s book was that the\nratio of omega-6 to omega-3\nin most Americans now is\n10:1 rather than 3:1 before\nthe introduction of seed oils in\nthe 80\u2019s. Hence a key note at\nthis point: don\u2019t start downing\nomega-3 pills unless you\nalso reduce your intake of\nomega-6!\nOmega-3 is highly unstable\nin nature, but sadly, the food\nindustry is more focused\non storing food (never buy\nanything with a shelf-life of\nforever, except for perhaps\nhoney) rather than promoting good health. So many\nmeat, dairy and other typical\nmarket buys are stuffed with\nomega-6 instead of the marginally better stuff, or worse\nstill, have omega-3 replaced\nwith partially hydrogenated\noils. Most supermarkets\npromote \u2018low-fat\u2019 or \u2018non-fat\u2019,\nwarping our minds into thinking that fat in general is the\ngreatest demon of all. Joseph\nHibbeln, a researcher at the\nNational Institute of Health\nsaid that the millions we\nspend nowadays on aspirin,\nibuprofen, and paracetamol\nis money spent to undo the\neffects of too much omega-6\nand too little omega-3 in the\ndiet. The scary bit doesn\u2019t\nend there. Similar population studies concluded that\nfalling rates of omega-3\nwere correlated to ADHD in\nchildren and rising rates of\nsuicide and depression. How\ncrazy is all this? The obvious\nsolution here would be to eat\nmore omega-3 rich foods, but\nin light of this fantastic book,\nI implore a more dedicated,\nalmost meditative approach.\nThis is not a lazy demand to\n\u2018eat well and be healthy\u2019, this\nis a necessary mental shift in\nthis day and age of growing\nnutrition science and bad\nmedia.\nBenjamin Collier\n// Sadly, the food\nindustry is more\nfocused on storing\nfood rather than\npromoting good\nhealth //\nI\nhereby appeal to\neveryone: pick up a\ncopy of Michael Pollan\u2019s\nIn Defence of Food this\nweek. It truly drives\nhome how food is being\ntreated in this nutrition-crazed world, with people\u2019s\nsad attempts to reduce it to\nhealth components. Most\nforget that food in itself is\nmore significant than this.\nOne key fact that stood out\nto me was Pollan\u2019s stance on\nomega 3, the polyunsaturated\nfatty acid which we know\nis good for overall health,\nespecially the brain. There\nare other fats which our body\ncan synthesise from other\nnutritional components, but\nomega 3 isn\u2019t one of them,\nmaking them more important\nthan we think.\nHigh in\nOmega-3\nHigh in\nOmega-6\nFlaxseed\nOil\nVegetable\nOil\nMayonnaise\nFish\nNuts and\nSeeds\nChia\nSeeds\nPotato/\nCorn chips\nSeafood\nFast\nFood\nSoybeans\n//Cloudtail the Snow Leopard\n\n"

I\u2019ve studied under both\nschool systems, coming out the\nother side with insights into\neach. No-one could accuse\nme of not being qualified\nenough to speak about the\nvirtues and pitfalls of the\ngrammar system. A significant\nnumber of Imperial students\nattended grammars and most\nlikely support the grammar\nsystem, either vociferously\nor nonchalantly; however, I\nwonder if from the privilege of\nyour educational bubble, you\nhave ever looked outside?\nUnder the guise of \u2018educational overhaul\u2019, the Tory\nand coalition governments\nthrough the actions of former\nresident government snake\nMr Michael Gove and his successor Nicky Morgan, as education secretary, have been\nresponsible for scrapping the\nintegrated AS-Level, trying to\nforce every school to become\nan \u2018Academy\u2019, and completely\nredesigning GCSEs with effectively zero notice. The latest\nbrainwave by our illustrious \u2013\nand need we mention unelected \u2013 Prime Minister Theresa\nMay, is to dispense with forty\nyears of alternately overt and\nimplicit educational policy, by\npaving the way for the reintroduction of that most divisive of\nschools: The Grammar school.\nFor the Scots, Welsh, or\nNortherners among you,\nGrammar schools are meant\nto represent a progressive utopia \u2013 poor but brilliant eleven\nyear olds are to be offered an\neducation akin to their rich pri-vately-educated counterparts\nin specialist schools where entry is based solely on academic merit. These brilliant children would be able to reach\ntheir potential without (heaven\nforbid!) the less erudite dragging them down. They would\nof course be selected using\nthe most accurate measure\nof intelligence known to man\n\u2013 the eleven plus entrance\nexam, serving as the key to the\nfuture. Pass it and a world of\nopportunity opens, but fail it\nand the doors are bolted shut.\nThe problem of this vision is\nthat the eleven plus exam is far\nfrom a level playing field for\nall students, acting more as a\nclass separator than a discrim-inator of intelligence. As anyone who has sat exams such\nas the UKCAT, MAT, or their\nilk will know that tutoring is\nomnipresent and shoved into\nyour face at every opportunity\n(shout out Medify). No matter\nhow \u2018tuition-proof\u2019 these exams claim to be, the availability of resources and practice to\nfamilies with the means to pay\nfar outstrips the poor with po-tential. Anecdotally, this leads\nto a middle-class invasion and\ninfiltrative classism with clear\nconsequences on students. It\u2019s\nnot without reason that Tatler, a traditional magazine of\nthe wealthy has published a\nlist of top state schools, most\nof which are grammars \u2013\nwhy waste money on Private\nschool tuition when tutoring\nfor the 11+ is cheaper? Grammars have become an outpost\nof the rich at the expense of\nothers.\nThe Grammar school I went\nto was situated in a deprived\narea, surrounded by poorly\nachieving comprehensives.\nConsequently, almost everyone in the local area took\nthe test to try and get in, else\nthey would have to resort to\nthe failing local secondaries.\nYou might expect then, that\nmy school would have people\nfrom the local area? In actual fact, I could count on two\nhands the number of people\nwho lived within walking distance to my school. Hundreds\nof kids are bussed in from the\nsurrounding areas commuting\nfor up to 45 minutes. If you\u2019ve\never commuted to uni, you\nalready know the negative\nimpacts of this; if you haven\u2019t,\nrelying on two daily school\nbuses to get there, effectively\npreventing you from partaking\nin after-school activities, isn\u2019t\nmuch fun at all. Schools should\nhave a strong link to their local\narea, with intake coming from\nthe local children and deeply\ninvolved in local society. How\ncan grammars possibly have\na link to the local community\nwhen three-quarters of their\nstudents come from an entirely\nseparate borough?\nGrammars suck the intelligent and rich out of local\nschools, leading to a high\nachieving enclave within\na failing school area. Poor\nschool results lead to difficulty recruiting excellent staff,\nand wealthier families choose\nto move away to other areas,\ncontributing to the isolation\nof the school community. The\nresult is a vicious cycle of failure and decline, from which\n\\\\ I wonder if from\nthe privilege of your\neducational bubble,\nyou have ever\nlooked outside? \\\\\n\\\\ We\u2019ve tried\ngrammar schools\nbefore, and they\ndon\u2019t work \\\\\n\\\\ Grammars suck the\nintelligent and rich out of\nlocal schools, leading to a\nhigh achieving enclave within\na failing school area \\\\\nLondon\u2019s secondaries are only\nrecently escaping.\nIt appears to me that a far\nsimpler solution, benefiting\nthe masses and preventing\nthe deepening of social di-vide, is simply to try and raise\nstandards across the board.\nI was fortunate enough to\nattend an excellent comprehensive school; indeed, its results ranked among grammar\nschools even though it takes\neveryone in from the local\ncommunity. Teaching quality\nwas on a par with the gram-mar, but with wider benefits\nfor the entire school popula-tion. There is no reason that\nother students around the\ncountry cannot benefit from\nthe same education, save for\nMrs May\u2019s idealism.\nWe\u2019ve tried grammar\nschools before, and they don\u2019t\nwork. The 163 educational relics scattered across England\nare not models to be revered,\nbut products of a bygone age.\nPerhaps we ought to spend\nless time shoving students\nbetween new educational\nmodels every few years, and\nactually invest in the teaching\nprofession. Segregation is not\nthe solution.\n\n"

In short: who\nknows? But we did some\nresearch (and asked a lot of\npeople) to try and at least\nvaguely answer some of these\nquestions.\nIt was really interesting\ntalking to straight men about\nmasculinity and whether they\nthink it impacts their desirabil-ity. Obviously our sample isn\u2019t\nnecessarily representative\nof the global population, or\neven the British population,\nbut hey, we tried.\nCharacteristics typically\nassociated with masculinity\nsuch as a good physique, ath-leticism, financial security and\nconfidence were acknowledged for playing a part in\nmale desirability but other\nmore traditionally feminine\ntraits, such as kindness and\nsensitivity were also considered important factors. Guys\nfelt that there is some pressure\nto be masculine, strong and to\npick up the bill, but they also\nfelt that women don\u2019t really\ncare much for demonstrations\nof bravado.\nDoes that illustrate a shift\naway from masculinity\nnorms? Maybe. At the end of\nMasc4Masc | felix seeks real man Lef Apostolakis\nthe month in Southbank, there\nwill be a whole weekend\ndedicated to addressing\nthe challenges and issues\nsurrounding the masculine\nidentity. Tackling about\nstopping violence towards\nwomen, addressing the\nsilence surrounding male\nmental health and generally\nthe social constraints that\nit\u2019s the unbearded male with\nthe strong jawline that has the\nadvantage, as beards signify\nage, maturity and social\nstatus, attributes sought after\nin long term partners.\n\u201cUgh this is so heteronormative.\u201d I was literally about\nto\u2013 Anyway, scientifically,\nit\u2019s strongly suggested that\ngay men prefer masculine\nfetishises it. Masculinity\nbecomes the main object of\ndesire, the ideal to aspire to,\nthe end goal. Being masculine\nbecomes an even greater\ncommodity: If I had a pound\nfor every time someone\nbegged me to let my mon-obrow grow, I\u2019d probably\nindulge in weekly eyebrow\nthreading.\nMasculinity is constantly\nsought after and applauded.\nGay culture is full of such\nexamples. Just take a look\nat the porn industry (or just\ntake our word for it). It is\noverflowing with hypermas-culinity, and a quick look at\nthe \u2018dating scene\u2019 will verify\nthat this is not an isolated\nphenomenon. Hook-up apps\nare full of unabashed masc-4masc profiles: users looking\nfor masculine men, real men,\nMEN.\nAs a gay man, you will\nreceive positive reinforcement\nfor every \u2018choice\u2019 you make\nthat enhances your mascu-linity. Do you have a beard?\nDo you have body hair? Are\nyou tall and muscular? Are\nyou an authority figure? Do\nyou do SPORTS? Is your voice\nnice and bassy? Do you have\na big dick? Prepare to be\nadored. You will be felt up in\nclubs, invited to threesomes\nand called daddy (probably).\nOn the other hand, your\nstock will lose value for\nevery choice you make that\nembraces your feminine side.\nDo you look like a prepubes-cent girl? Do you sway your\nhips when you walk? Do you\nindulge in elaborate hand\ngestures? Is your voice high\npitched? Do you dress flam-boyantly? Sorry, no femmes\n(unless you\u2019re so hyperfem-inine you fall into a fetish\ncategory).\nIt is a very weird situation\nto be in. Imagine you\u2019ve just\ncome out, thinking you\u2019ve left\nall those people who belittle\nyour masculinity because\nof your sexuality (gay men\naren\u2019t real men), only to find\npeople who passive aggressively belittle your masculinity\n(I\u2019m not into camp men. I just\ndon\u2019t like it when gay men\nplay into the stereotype. If I\nwanted a flamboyant man, I\u2019d\nbe straight).\nYeah. Kinda awkward at\nbest. Soul-destroyingly disgusting at worst.\nSo does masculinity affect\nyour sexual success? Probably. Should you be worried\nabout it? Probably not. Just\nbe yourself, \u2018cause at the end\nof the day, it doesn\u2019t matter\nhow much you\u2019re getting, if\nyou feel dead inside.\n// For city boys,\nmascing it up will\nprobably help //\n// Do you have a\nbig dick? Prepare to\nbe adored //\n// Sorry, no femmes\n(unless you\u2019re so\nhyperfeminine that\nyou fall into a fetish\ncategory) //\n// When it comes\nto hooking up, it\u2019s\nthe unbearded\nmale with the strong\njawline that has the\nadvantage //\nmen (just as straight men\nprefer feminine women).\nThis pressure, contrary to\npopular belief and despite (or\nmaybe because of) the gay\nstereotype hypermasculinises\nTHE GAYS. As Greg Brown\nfrom ASAPScience explains,\nif masculinity is the approval\nand acceptance from other\nmen, then gay men (who for\nobvious reasons constantly\nseek the approval of other\nmen) are hypermasculine.\nSo it\u2019s fair to say the male\ngay scene has a particularly odd relationship with\nmasculinity. It glorifies and\ndefine masculinity.\n\u201cBut will looking masculine\nget me laid?\u201d It\u2019s complicated brah. Looking purely\nat the sexual appeal of yo\u2019\nface, a 2014 study showed\nthat masculine faces were\nmore desirable in urban\nenvironments, suggesting\nthat traditional Western\nmasculinity norms are socially\nconstructed and break down\nin novel societies. Another\nstudy found that beards are\nmore sought after in cities\nwith larger populations. So\nfor city boys, mascing it up\nwill probably help.\nAt the same time, don\u2019t over\ndo it. Beards, for example,\nare trendy and all that, but\na recent study suggests that\nwhen it comes to hooking up,\n\n"

Whether\nit was Star Trek in\nthe 60s pushing for minority\nrights, or shows like Will &\nGrace and Ellen normalising\nand publicising LGBT rights\nin the 90s, TV has frequently\nbeen willing and capable\nto push the envelope. One\nof the areas it has perhaps\nlagged behind, however, is\nin its handling of the male\nprotagonist.\nThere tend to be about three\nmodes for any leading male\ncharacters: the platonic,\nwholesome \u2018hero\u2019, the gruff\n\u2018anti-hero\u2019, or the squirrelly\n\u2018nerd\u2019. All three hinge on a\nlimited, traditional idea of\nwhat defines \u2018masculinity\u2019\n\\\\ There tend to be\nabout three modes\nfor male characters:\nthe platonic,\nwholesome \u2018hero\u2019,\nthe gruff \u2018anti-hero\u2019,\nor the squirrelly\nnerd \\\\\nor, in the case of the third,\nthe lack thereof. The \u2018hero\u2019 is\nthe oldest of these, the classical John Wayne-type with\nchiselled jaw and chiselled\nethics. The \u2018nerd\u2019 is smart but\ncowardly, well-meaning but\nlacking the courage to stand\nup for what he believes in.\nThe \u2018anti-hero\u2019 is perhaps\nthe most infuriating of the\nrejectionist stereotypes, often\nsquandering the opportunity to examine traditionally\nneglected aspects of the\nmale psyche. Addictions and\nmental illnesses are trivial-ised and turned into purely\ncosmetic affectations, while\nself-destructive behaviour is\nfetishized.\nAs of late, however, series\nhave been making efforts\nto fully consider the impact\nof this mind-set, and various\ndifferent shows have begun\nconsidering the traditionally\ntaboo subject of men\u2019s mental\nhealth. In general, TV has\nbegun to question its own,\nand to an extent society\u2019s\ndefinitions of masculinity.\nShows such as Mad Men,\nBojack Horseman, and Rick\nand Morty present incredibly\nflawed male protagonists that\nmight be superficially likened\nto \u2018anti-heroes\u2019. The difference\nhere is that an attempt is\nmade to examine thoroughly\nthe consequences of and\nreasons for their self-destruc-tive behaviour. In fact, it is a\ncentral theme in both of the\naforementioned series.\nMad Men\u2019s Don Draper\nis the quintessential picture\nof the \u2018ideal man\u2019; suave,\nsuccessful, and dapper. Yet\nhe is also an adulterous wom-aniser, a worsening alcoholic\nand smoker, and running from\nhis past. None of these things\nare glorified here, and are\ninstead scrutinised. Draper\u2019s\nflakiness and constant need\nto find new partners is a\nconsequence of his poor\nrelationship with his parents\nand a result of growing up in\na brothel. His alcoholism is a\ndependency.\nSimilarly, Bojack and Rick\nand Morty present aging protagonists struggling to cope\nwith their depression. Their\nfronts of stoicism are quickly\nrevealed to be manifestations of one of the most toxic\naspects of \u2018masculinity\u2019: the\nreluctance to seek help. Over\nthe courses of their respective\nseries, both spiral further into\ndarkness, all the while retaining a coarse exterior and\npushing people away. These\nThis is what real men look like \\\\ William Tung\nqualities are what feed into\ntheir various self-destructive\nbehaviours.\nMore and more shows are\nrepresenting experiences\nengaging in discussion that is\ndiscouraged by \u2018masculinity\u2019.\nThe underrated SundanceTV\nshow, Rectify, discusses the\ntouchy subject of prison\nsexual assault. The oddly\naccepted and ridiculed reality\nof prison-rape is put under the\nlens here. The protagonist is\na victim of this, and the show\nfollows his attempts to come\nto terms with his experiences\nand life outside prison. There\nare no jokes made at his\nexpense and the series does\nnot shy away from thoroughly\ndissecting the impact of such\nan event. A big part of the\nseries is also the reactions\nof other characters to the\nprotagonist\u2019s experiences,\nand how society attempts to\nbelittle them.\nEven Donald Glover\u2019s\nAtlanta points out the sorts of\ntoxic masculinity poverty and\nghettos can generate, and\ntheir natural end-points. The\nvery first episode ends with\none of the main characters\nshooting and killing a random\nstranger, just to avoid losing\nface.\nOn a more real-world level,\nartist Grayson Perry has\nmade multiple documentaries questioning traditional\ndefinitions of masculinity\nand sexuality. All Man, in\nparticular, takes the viewer\nto various locales typically\nassociated with masculine\nactivities and highlights the\ndysfunction or contradiction\nthat can reign there.\nWe\u2019ve come leaps and\nbounds since the paper-thin\nplatonic heroes of early\ndramas and sitcoms, and the\never-diversifying TV industry\nseems to be gradually\nengaging with, and hopefully\nnormalising, a diverse range\nof concepts of masculinity.\n\\\\ More shows\nare representing\nexperiences that\n\u2018masculinity\u2019\ndiscourages \\\\\nUnfortunately,\nmen dominate\nthe best roles in\ntelevision. So,\nyou\u2019d think that\nthey\u2019d at least be\nrepresented with\nnuance, right?\nWell, that tends\nnot to be the\ncase.\n\n"

At the same time,\nmaintenance grants and NHS\nbursaries are being scrapped,\nand the student loan terms are\nbeing changed.\nThe march was announced\nearlier this year in July, but\nhas steadily been gaining\nmomentum. On Monday\nthe 14th\nof November,\nthe government released\namendments to the Higher\nEducation and Research Bill\nEducation demo still happening\n...despite the Higher Education and Research Bill ammendments\nLef Apostolakis\nof university governance\nand downgrading research\ncouncils.\nIn a piece for the Guardian,\npublished last October,\nProfessor Stephen Curry,\nDirector of Undergraduate\nStudies in the Department\nof Life Sciences, addressed\nthe need for amendments to\nthe Bill, and warned against\nthe Teaching Excellence\nFramework (TEF), particularly\nthe creation of a super-research council. \u201cNever\nbefore in the history of British\nscience have so few individuals\nbeen responsible for so much\nspending,\u201d wrote Curry.\nFurther on the downgrade\nof research councils and the\ncreation of a new powerful\noverarching council, UK\nResearch and Innovation\n(UKRI), Curry wrote: \u201cfrom\nbefore the middle of the last\ncentury, science\u2019s influence\nin government has had multi-polar characteristics. Heads of\nautonomous funding councils,\nWhitehall chief scientists,\nlearned societies, academics,\nand even campaign groups\nhave together worked with,\nand sometimes against,\ngovernment to protect the\nresearch base. This can never\nbe the task of one or two\nindividuals, yet the proposed\narrangements invest a great\ndeal of power in the chair and\nchief executive of UKRI.\u201d\nWe talked to Curry about\nthe amendments released\nearlier this week: \u201cI was\npleased to see the amendment\non Monday that sought to\nclarify that the Secretary of\nState (via the OfS) could NOT\ngive any guidance on what\ncourses universities could or\ncould not teach,\u201d said Curry.\n\u201cHowever the OfS still has\nthe power to repeal university\nRoyal Charters and that still\nseems to me to be a threat\nto the independence and\nautonomy of our universities. I\nalso remain concerned about\nthe loss of voice and standing\nof the research councils in the\nestablishment of UKRI. I\u2019m not\nagainst UKRI per se \u2013 it could\nwell do some good things but\nI think further amendments or\nclarifications are needed to\nensure that the voice of the\nresearch community is heard\nloud and clear in government\u201d\nHowever, Sorana Vieru,\nNUS Vice President (Higher\nEducation) warns, \u201cnow is not\nthe time to be complacent\u2026\n[students] will be taking to\nthe streets on November 19\nto demand our voices are\nheard.\u201d\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m pleased to see\nthe changes we\u2019ve been\ncalling for put in place, the\nbeing made about them.\nThese amendments show how\nstudents can have an impact\nand influence change if we\nwork together\u201d, she continues.\nThe education demo is\norganised by the National\nStudents Union (NUS) and\nthe University College Union\n(UCU). In preparation, at a\nrally hosted by SOAS Union\non Wednesday, attended by\nNUS President Malia Bouattia\nand Leader of the Labour\nparty, Jeremy Corbyn.\nWhen asked about the\nstance of ICU on the education\ndemo, Union President Nas\nAndriopoulos said \u201cImperial\nCollege Union, which is not\naffiliated to the National\nUnion of Students, does not\nhave a formal stance on the\ndemonstration or the Higher\nEducation and Research Bill.\nAs of yet, none of our students\nhave approached the Union to\njoin the demonstration. We do,\nhowever, hold concerns about\nthe bill which will allow for-profit organisations to enter\nthe Higher Education sector\nmore easily. Furthermore,\nwe do not think that the\nmetrics that will be used\nto access teaching quality\nin the Teaching Excellence\nFramework are necessarily a\ngood measure for excellence.\u201c\nhe continued.\nAmendments also included\nappointing a student\nrepresentative to the Office\nfor Students Board, more\nsupport for postgraduate\nresearch training and stronger\nprotection of students. \u201cIt\nseems to me a good idea to\nhave student representation\nin the OfS,\u201d said Curry,\n\u201chowever, I remain worried\nabout aspects of the TEF\n\u2013 it still risks becoming\nburdensome and too heavily\ndriven by metrics which (as we\nall know) do a very poor job\nof capturing or characterising\neducational quality, which is\nthe thing that students, staff\nand government all ought to\nbe working together on.\u201d\nThe amendments were made\npublic as Jo Johnson, Minister\nof State for Universities and\nSciencetooktotwittertoinform\nstudents and lecturers of the\ngovernment\u2019s willingness to\nlisten, saying \u201cThanks for the\nscrutiny - listened to students,\nunis and academics,and today\ntabling range of amendments\nto the HE & Research Bill\u201d.\noriginal omission of a student\nfrom an office named after\nus showed the government\u2019s\nplans for what they really are\n\u2013 driving market competition\nand not ensuring student\nneeds are met.

    "content": "Friday 18 November 2016 17\nculture.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/culture\nfelix\nC U L T U R E\nCohen\u2019s last album marks the end\nof a legendary career. Filled with\nmellifluous lyrics and soul-stirring\nmusic, it has been received with\ncritical acclaim. Sadly 2016 has\nstolen another great, but can an\nartist like Cohen ever really leave\nus behind?\nT\nhis is not strictly a\nreview. Given the\ncircumstances it\ncan\u2019t be. Instead,\nit is a look at how\nan album takes on\na new life when its creator\npasses away so shortly\nafter its release \u2013 or, more\nappropriately, how an album\nallows for the continuation\nof a life that is no more. If\nyou read practically any\nof the existing reviews for\nLeonard Cohen\u2019s now final\nLP, You Want It Darker, you\u2019ll\nsee a string of 4 star, 5 star,\n9/10 and \u2018A\u2019 reviews. These\nhave not come about from\na sense of pity on behalf of\nthe music press \u2013 nor could\nthey, the album was released\nover a fortnight before his\nsad passing on 7th\nNovember\n\u2013 but because the album is\nquite simply that good.\nThere\u2019s no mistaking\nCohen\u2019s age on You Want\nIt Darker. Reaching his 82nd\nyear during the recording\nprocess, his voice has permanently dropped an octave\nor two since his debut in the\n60s. But in alignment with his\nprevious works, the poetry,\nthe religious overtones, and\nmost importantly, the humour\nremain. It\u2019s easy to miss\nbehind the melancholy of the\nmusic that Cohen has delivered over the last 5 decades,\nbut his dry wit is what sets him\napart from the majority of his\ncontemporaries: \u201cI heard the\nsnake was baffled by his sin,\nhe shed his skin to find the\nsnake within\u201d, \u201cI struggled\nwith some demons, they were\nmiddle class and tame\u201d. It\u2019s\nnot laugh out loud like a\nRandy Newman song, but\nupon reflection you can spot\nthe nods and winks laying\nwithin the harrowing subject\nmatter. On a side note, Is This\nWhat You Wanted is perhaps\nthe best example of the juxtaposition of pain and humour\nin Cohen\u2019s career. Away from\nLeonard\u2019s own performance,\nthe instrumentation on You\nWant it Darker is second\nto none. From the driving\nbaseline of the album\u2019s title\ntrack, to the surf-rock guitar\nof Leaving the Table, and the\ndevastatingly beautiful strings\nnear the album\u2019s end, Cohen,\nhis son Adam, and Patrick\nLeonard are to be commended for the production\nacross the 35 minute run time.\nNot forgetting, of course, the\nfemale backing vocalists, a\nconstant in Cohen\u2019s music as\nmuch as the wit, but who take\non a new life when heard\nalongside the now deeper\nvoice of the Canadian singer.\nYou Want it Darker is\nthe third studio album to\nbe released by Cohen\nsince 2012, Old Ideas and\nPopular Problems being the\npredecessors, a prolific streak\naccompanied by relatively\nconsistent touring since 2008.\nMuch of this, it is speculated,\nis down to money problems.\nIn 1994 Cohen had all but\nretired from music; the singer\nmoved to the Mt. Baldy Zen\nCentre, a Buddhist Monastery\nin the Californian Mountains,\nto the West of Los Angeles.\nenjoyed his return to musical\nrelevance so much that they\ncontinued well beyond the\npoint of necessity. What\nwas so remarkable about\nthis return to song writing,\nhowever, is not how it came\nabout, but that the resulting\nmusic was so great. Many an\nartist has delved back into the\nstudio after a long period of\nmusical silence, lured by the\npromise of rekindled wealth,\nonly to produce frankly dire\nand sickeningly nostalgic\nalbums. Unlike most, Cohen\nentered a completely new\nartistic period in his career,\nwhich was received with\nacclaim from fans and critics\nalike. A dazzling climax for\none of modern music\u2019s great\nheroes.\nMuch was made in January\nof this year at the poignancy\nand beauty of David Bowie\u2019s\nBlackstar \u2013 he knew his death\nwas upon him, and his lyrics\nand music reflected that in\na devastatingly wonderful\nmanner. Comparisons of\nCohen\u2019s and Bowie\u2019s final\nreleases are inevitable \u2013\nboth men lost their lives to\ncancer. What sets the events\nsurrounding You Want It\nDarker apart from Blackstar,\nhowever, is the time between\nalbum release and artist\u2019s\ndeath. For Bowie, this was just\ntwo days, while for Cohen,\nover two weeks. Reviews\nof Blackstar were thus rife\nwith analysis of Bowie\u2019s last\nhurrah. With You Want It\nDarker, there was time to\nassimilate and see an album\nbeyond just a swansong. On\nthe face of it, the album is a\ncollection of love songs, a lost\nlove, a love that keeps the\nworld from going cold, and\nof a love for our protagonist\u2019s\nsaviour (Treaty, If I Didn\u2019t\nHave Your Love, and Travelling Light, in that order).\nOf course, from this week\nall of that has changed. For\nthe generations of Leonard\nCohen fans to come, of\nwhich there will be many, the\n\\\\ But in alignment\nwith his previous\nworks, the poetry,\nthe religious\novertones, and most\nimportantly, the\nhumour remain \\\\\nHe was ordained a Zen\nBuddhist monk in 1996, and\nstayed at the centre until\n1999. During this period and\ninto the 2000s Cohen\u2019s manager and former lover, Kelly\nLynch, managed his finances,\nbut recklessly. Lynch effectively stole millions of dollars\nfrom Cohen. Despite suing\nand winning in 2005, Cohen\nnever got his money back,\nmuch of which was a retirement fund. So came the tours\nand albums, though Cohen\nCohen\u2019s light has gone dark, but the night\nwill not have him\n\\\\ This is not strictly\na review. Given the\ncircumstances it can\u2019t\nbe \\\\\n\\\\ Cohen entered\na completely new\nartistic period in\nhis career, which\nwas received with\nacclaim \\\\\n\\\\ Takahiro Kyono\n\n"

Meanwhile we\nsend our best wishes to the\nwomen competing in their\nregionals this weekend.\nT\nhe indoor frisbee\nseason has well\nand truly got\nunderway, and\nthe Imperial disc\nDoctors (dD) were\nable to send three teams to\nthe men\u2019s indoor regionals,\none of only two teams in the\nregion to be able to do so.\nHaving won this competition\nlast year, expectations were\nhigh, but the team wanted to\ntake a steady approach for\ncontinued success.\nThe first few games\nfor the 1st\nteam were\nstraightforward, generally\nplaying lower-ability teams.\nThere was one must-win\ngame against an under\nseeded UEA 1s side; a\nloss here would\u2019ve put the\ntournament win out of reach.\ndD were definitely up for\nthis and came out strong\nto go 3-0 up, a lead that\nthey would hold, eventually\nwinning 7-3.\nSunday saw the team finish\nthe group stages beating\nCambridge 2s 8-2. Next\nwas a semi-final against\nCambridge 1s, a fixture with\nsome history after we broke\ntheir winning streak last\nyear. dD came out strong\nas usual and won a place in\nthe final against St Mary\u2019s,\na one dimensional team\nwith several tall receivers.\nOnce again, dD came out\nwith a great defensive setup\nto put pressure on those\nlong throws and competed\nwell in the air. Despite\nfalling behind early on,\ndD\u2019s patience and clinical\noffence saw them through\nto win the final 7-5, with a\nCallahan (Ultimate Frisbee\u2019s\nequivalent of an own-goal)\nto secure the game.\ndD 2s had a mixed pool\nwith two 1st\nteams and two\nfairly even 2nd\nteams. They\nwere able to see off both\nof the second teams in\ntheir group to hold seed,\nincluding not conceding in\nan 8-0 victory over UCL.\nThis placed them in the 9-16\nbracket in which they fought\nwell and had a noticeable\nvictory beating Cambridge\n2s, a satisfying repeat of\nmixed regionals two weeks\nago.\ndD 3s had a relatively\ndifficult group, where they\nwere both learning to play\nas a team and playing\ntough opposition. They were\nnoticeably growing as a\nunit throughout their fixtures\nand were able to compete\nwell in the round robin and\neven though they beat both\nHertfordshire and UCL\n2s, they were only able to\nfinish 20th\n(out of 22).

Cooking a steak\nlike this, directly on a bed of\nembers, is an experience to\ntry if you haven\u2019t already - the\nend result is something that\nreally makes me feel alive.\non the outside, there is never\nthe same degree of perfection\nin the inside. I\u2019ve done pan\nfried, reverse seared, roasted\nand almost every varia-tion. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\nthey were all tasty - but the\nbeautifully tender middle was\nspoiled by the band of grey,\novercooked meat around\nthe edge - a simple flaw with\nThe only problem is, crunching your way thorugh bits\nof burned on charcoal isn\u2019t\nexactly tasty. That, plus the\nwide disparity in the degree\nof doneness in the steak\nruined what should have\nbeen a beautiful dish.\nI have cooked steaks in\nmany ways, and the underlying problem with so many\nis that whilst they may look\nbeautiful, browned and crisp\ndirect heat cooking and the\nfact that no steak is perfectly\nuniform - some areas will\ncook faster than others.\nThe only method yet to satisfy my desire for pink, tender\nmeat from edge to edge is\nsous-vide \u2013 waterbathing\na vacuum sealed piece of\nmeat for anywhere from 1-72\nhours, with amazing results.\nI was fortunate enough to be\ngiven an immersion circulator\n(read: heating element, pump\nand temperature feedback)\nfor my 21st, and good god\nof food, it transforms steaks.\nIt give you something that\nin the restaurant world we\ndesire exceptionally highly \u2013\nconsistency \u2013 as by cooking\nat 54.5C, you guarantee\na perfect medium rare.

Last play of the\ngame. Continuing to connect\nphase after phase, the\nopportunity eventually came\nand full back Alex Hawkings\ncrossed the whitewash to put\nIC even. Windy conditions\ntipped the ball off the tee\ntwice so Charles Price-Smith,\nreplacing regular kicker\nHenry \u2018Topknot\u2019 Allingham,\nlined up the drop kick, drifting\njust wide of the posts. A\nvaliant draw to finish and a\nperfect set up to a team pub\ngolf trip, leaving the majority\nof the team handicapped (pun\nfully intended).\nT\nhe 9th\nof November\nsaw the rugby 1st\nXV arrive at their\never windy fortress\nHarlington to face\nUCL. After a brief\nhiatus during the warm-up,\nthe team were out for a few\nminutes before heading back\ninto the changing room to\nslide on their \u2018mysteriously\nmoist\u2019 playing shirts.\nAt kick off, IC came out\nfiguratively (and literally)\nsteaming as they applied\npressure on the opposition.\nTouchline support saw the\nfour biggest tackles of the\nseason so far in the space of\ntwo minutes. Each individual\nbattle put UCL behind the\ngain line. Although IC\nstruggled for possession, it\nwas clear UCL had little to\noffer from their backline as\ntheir forwards continued to\npick and go from multiple\nrucks. Despite this, a ragged\nball out to their backs and\na dropped tackle saw\nthem head under the posts\nfor their first points. Not\ndisheartened, IC were soon\nback in UCL\u2019s red zone, with\nJosh O\u2019Donnell finishing off a\nfantastic display of physicality\nfrom the squad\u2019s favourite\nginger, Sam Moorby.\nIC\u2019s lineout was struggling\nto find a rhythm, with plenty\nof lost possession. This\nwasn\u2019t helped by fly half\nJames Field, who decided\nto question whether the ref\nknew what sport we were\nplaying. He confirmed\nwe were indeed playing\ngentlemen\u2019s rugby, by raising\nhis right arm to place Field in\nthe sin-bin. This put the team\nunder pressure and placed\nthe opposition on IC\u2019s try line.\nA lapse of concentration from\nbewildered Alex Clayton\nallowed UCL to jump over the\nline for an easy try.\nIC came out firing after the\nrestart. Eventual Man-of-theMatch Clayton exploited\nisolated attackers to steal\ntheir possession twice at\nTopofthePeck-ingorder\nL\nast weekend, fresher\nHarry Peck competed\nat the Irish Open, an\ninternational men\u2019s\n\u00e9p\u00e9e tournament in\nDublin. Although he\nhas fenced regularly at an\ninternational level for both the\ncadet under-17s and junior\nunder-20s, it was Harry\u2019s\nfirst senior international\nevent. Starting the day with\nno ranking Harry ended\nup in poule one, where he\nachieved five victories out of\na possible six, losing only to\nGiannotte from Luxembourg\nwhilst defeating fencers from\nIreland, Australia, Slovakia\nand Germany.\nThe first round acted as\nseeding for the second round,\nwhere Harry found himself\nin poule six. He won three\nof five matches, beating\ncompetitors from Slovenia,\nthe USA and Poland along\nthe way. The losses came\ncourtesy of a fencer from\nSingapore and his Brixton\nclubmate, also in the pool\nwith him, from Bulgaria. After\nthese two rounds Harry found\nhimself in 29th\nplace going\ninto the direct eliminations out\nof 64 fencers.\nIn the first round of\nknockout matches, Harry\nfaced off against French\nfencer Martelly, seeded\n36th\n. Refereed by Imperial\u2019s\nown Jamie Simpson, Harry\novercame his start to finish\nincredibly strongly winning the match 15-12. This\ngave Harry a really tough\nmatch in the last 32 of the\ncompetition against the 3rd\nranked fencer Zorzato from\nPoland. The result of the\nmatch was even clearer than\nthe first, a comfortable win\nfor Harry 15-9, setting him\nup against his Great Britain\nand Brixton teammate, Aml\nSinclair. Again Harry breezed\npast his opponent earning\nhimself a place in the quarter\nfinal of the competition\nagainst the Portuguese fencer\nArede.\nThis match proved to be the\ntightest so far, coming down\nto a sudden death point. But\nHarry again proved his ability to be triumphant, winning\n13-12. The semi-final against\nthe Romanian Dragomir was\na return to form for Harry,\nwinning 15-10 and setting\nup a nail-biting final against\nanother of Dragomir\u2019s fellow\ncountrymen. The final was\nback and forth, neither fencer\ntaking a substantial lead.\nThe Romanian led Harry for\nlong periods of time, however\nour Brit pulled ahead at a\ndecisive time in the match to\nwin 15-13 and take the title\nof Irish Open Champion! This\nmoves Harry just outside the\nworld top 200.

After arriving at\na university campus where\nthe only signs of life were\nan unsuspecting man in a\nkitchen and a karate class,\nthe team were nonetheless\nconfused. None more so than\nTJ Leo Pashov, who insisted\nwe were still in Belgium.\nThe men had drawn strong\nopponents in the group\nstages, namely Essen and\nthe home favourites Aachen.\nThe women also had Aachen,\nwith DJK SV Poseidon\nmembers of the squad having\nnot played competitively\nbefore, it was not all doom\nand gloom. There were some\npositives. David Moores and\nTobias Dawson completed\nthe club\u2019s first successful \u2018Protokol\u2019 in two years, making an\nimpression on the locals with\ntheir interpretation and button\npressing skills. More positive,\nhopefully lasting, impressions\nincluded personal achievements for Andrew Duckworth\nand Ronan Tanguy, who\nwere complimented on their\nwater polo assets (cheeky)\nby an interested local. An\nafter party followed; a great\nchance for International Relations officer Sam to find out\nthat local teens thought quite\nhighly of British students.\nWith the words of the great\nMickie Krause still ringing in\ntheir ears, the guys lined up\non the Sunday morning full\nof optimism. Despite Sam\u2019s\nbest efforts to deflect tame\nopposition shots into his own\nnet, one Imperial goal (scored\nby Ramon, dedicated to\nJenny Lea) led to another and\nbefore we knew it, Imperial\nwon by a favourable margin.\nNext game also saw success,\neverything capped off with\na debut international goal\nfrom Jon Arizti. Finishing\nwith a 50-50 win ratio, the\nhighest ever from an Imperial\nDuisburg for company but\nwith their squad totalling\nonly three players, they were\ngoing to have a tough time\nplaying a seven-a-side sport.\nOnce the Germans finally\nshowed up, a team bonding\nsession alleviated concerns.\nHaving borrowed players,\nteam in the tournament, the\nguys could go home happy.\nThe girls unfortunately come\naway without a win, despite\nLaura\u2019s best dabbing efforts.\nOverall, a successful trip.\nHuge thanks to Social Sec\nMassive Tobias Dawson for\norganising everything.

Or fines\nnight.\n\\\\ Imperial won\nby a favourable\nmargin \\\\\nthe women made a nervous\nstart, with club President Tina\nTrigle tackling teammate\nOzzie, stealing the ball and\npassing it to the opposition.\nThe guys were also having\nproblems, with a \u2018moving\ngoal\u2019 blamed for the dip in\nshooting form.

By now,\nmost of the world seems to\nknow that Donald Trump is\nthe president-elect of the\nUnited States.\nWhat isn\u2019t as clear, however,\nis how much he will scale\nback from his hateful rhetoric\nand proposed policies during\nhis year-and-a-half long\ncampaign.\nTrump has revealed a lot\nsince his victory, some of which\nwas aired in a 60 Minutes\ninterview with Leslie Stahl on\nAmerican TV Sunday night.\nBut even with Trump\u2019s\nsurprising victory, some\nImperial students aren\u2019t\nshocked \u2013 because they\nhaven\u2019t been following along.\n\u201cThere have been a lot of\npages in the news about it, but\nI\u2019ve been studying and trying\nto get in publications and\npapers,\u201d said Caner Sahim,\na 27-year-old PH.D. student\nstudying electronics.\nDavid O\u2019Reilly, a 21-year-old student in his fourth year\nof chemistry, has also been\nuninterested.\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow politics at all,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI\u2019ve just never really\nbeen interested \u2026 I really like\nreading, specifically the fiction\ngenre.\u201d\nOne idea many devastated\nAmericans have had is to\nmove to Canada because of\nTrump\u2019s victory. Alexis Boutin,\nhowever, doesn\u2019t think that will\nwork as well as some people\nthink.\n\u201cTo be honest, I see all these\npeople moving to Canada,\nbut it\u2019s such a different country\nthan the United States,\u201d\nsaid Boutin, a 23 year-old\nCanadian studying finance\nand accounting.\nIt also isn\u2019t as easy as\nAmericans think to just move\nnorth. The Washington Post, an\nAmerican newspaper based in\nthe nation\u2019s capital, reported\nthat Americans will still need\na permanent resident\u2019s visa\nin order to move past the\nCanadian border.

The meeting, to\nbe held by Hammersmith &\nFulham Council is likely to be\nkey in gauging public support\nfor keeping the hospital open.\nTo understand just how\nimportant this issue is to\nresidents, one only has to\nexplore the local picture. In\n2014, control of H&F Council\nchanged hands, largely as a\nresult of debate over the future\nof Charing Cross. Walking\nthrough the borough, \u201cSave\nOur Hospitals \u2013 no votes here\nfor candidates that don\u2019t listen\u201d\nposters adorn windows. Even\nlocal celebrities, such as Bill\nBailey, are coming on board\nthe campaign. The Save Our\nHospitals group, previously\nscoffed at by politicians,\nis now regularly attending\nImperial College Trust board\nmeetings and scrutinising the\ndecisions they make; forcing\nconcessions on a range of\nissues and bringing the debate\ninto the public eye.\nThe plans they oppose\ncome as part of the North\nWest London Sustainability\nand Transformation Plan\n(STP) \u2013 inspired by the Five\nYear Forward Review for\nthe NHS \u2013 which places a\ngreater emphasis on the need\nfor increased primary care\nprovision, better IT facilities,\nand education to enhance\ngeneral public health.\nHowever, campaigners\ncontend that this shift is at\nthe expense of acute care,\nand could be seen merely\nas a cost-cutting exercise. A\nkey part of the STP will see\nEaling Hospital close in the\nnext few years, with Charing\nCross to potentially follow\n\\\\ Even local\ncelebrities, such\nas Bill Bailey, are\ncoming on board\nthe campaign \\\\\nSelf explanatory really \\\\ Save Our Hospitals\n\u201clocal hospital\u201d is and just\nhow extensive the demolition\nprocess will be.\nWhilst the government states\nthis is part of a wider goal to\nequalise health outcomes\nfor people in different\ncommunities, campaigners\ncontend that the issues run\nmuch deeper.

This\nhowever, is exactly what\nwe\u2019ve seen take place with\nfresh new artists championing\nthe cause to give these issues\na well-deserved place in the\nspotlight.\nThe emergence of honest\nand introspective rap is\nfar from a new phenom-enon; in fact some of our\nmost celebrated rap artists\nincluding Biggie, Tupac and\nEminem have been known to\nrap about the grim realities\nof their past with brave\nhonesty. In Death Around\nThe Corner Tupac plays the\nrole of a character living in\na harsh urban wasteland\nwhere the \u201cskinny\u201d people\n\u201cdie\u201d and where his character is fixated on \u201cstaying\nhigh\u201d. His effort to escape\nthis numbing habit quickly\nspirals into a loss of control,\nanxiety and paranoia. He\ndraws parallels between\nhimself and his father who\nhe says was \u201cmadder than a\nmotherfucker\u201d, as he realizes\nthe hereditary nature of his\ntendencies. Artists have since\ncontinued along this stream\nof self-reflection and social\ncommentary but this has often\nbeen paired with equally striking and blooming confidence,\nand a focus on issues that the\nartist has overcome, and so\nserves as a sign of success\nrather than weakness.\nAlternatively artists like\nMarshall Mathers have indirectly gone about channeling\nthese thoughts through characters elaborately created\nto touch upon whatever is\ndeemed taboo. This technique\nhas been employed more\nrecently by artists such as\nTyler the Creator who plays\nWolf Haley, a balaclava\nwearing alter ego with a taste\nfor \u201cGreen paper, gold teeth,\nand pregnant gold retrievers\u201d.\nThrough Wolf he expresses\nthe darker and more twisted\ncorners of his imagination,\nbut never without struggle,\nas Tyler retorts with \u201cFuck\nsocial media labeling them\nas \u201csoft\u201d and \u201clame\u201d. Often\nthese criticisms have come\nfrom fellow musicians and\nprominent members of the\nmusic industry. Incidents like\nthis remain proof that many\nlisteners continue to yearn for\nthe more traditional rhetoric\nof success, stories of coping\nin the face of adversity and\ntransforming ones life from\nrags to riches.\nMental health and hip\nhop have had a difficult\nrelationship for decades,\nwith members of the culture\ninsisting the matter being\na fallacy, or worse, even a\nsign of weakness. This had\nled to many artists rejecting\ncollaboration with those keen\nto speak out about personal\nvulnerabilities, or even worse,\nlabels refusing to put out\nreleases where these topics\ntake center stage. Artists like\nDrake have been frequently\nmocked for speaking openly\nabout their feelings of iso-lation, jealousy, paranoia\nand irrationality. Many of\nhis releases were met with\nharsh criticism especially\nafter recent tensions when\nMeek Mill accused Drake\nof using ghost writers on his\nalbum. Meek Mill took part\nin the back and forth on\nsocial media during which\nhe attacked Drake saying \u201cI\nheard that shit, that shit was\nvery soft. Baby lotion soft\u201d. In\nan environment where hyper\nmasculinity and self-suffi-ciency are cherished, writing\nemotionally sensitive songs\nwith the help of ghost writers\noften means asking for this\nkind of harsh reception. With\nthis kind of backdrop, recent\nefforts by rap artists like\nKendrick Lamar to speak out\nabout isolation and substance\nabuse should be recognized\nand credited. In his track\nSwimming Pools, Kendrick\nspeaks about how alcoholism\nbegins with an attempt \u201cto fit\nin the popular\u201d and quickly\nspirals into a self-medicated\nneed to \u201cdrown their sorrows\u201d. Kendrick even goes\nto great lengths discussing\nthe genetic predisposition\nto alcoholism when he raps\nabout how his \u201cgranddaddy\nhad that golden flask\u201d.\nOne new artist in particular\nwho experienced the brunt of\nrigid attitudes towards what a\nrap artist should or shouldn\u2019t\nbe is R&B/Soul musician\nFrank Ocean, who spoke\nvery openly about being\ngay in the rap industry. In an\ninterview in 2014, he spoke\nabout the difficulty getting to\nwork with other rap artists in\na studio, simply because of\ntheir prejudices towards his\nsexual orientation. Nonetheless, Frank Ocean was able to\ngarner a dedicated fan base\nwith tracks such as Thinkin\u2019\nBout You where he sings;\n\u201cMy eyes don\u2019t shed tears,\nbut boy, they bawl when\nI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 \u2018bout you\u201d \u2013 a\nsubtle nod towards the love\ninterest he sings about. More\nclearly however, on We All\nAnte Up | a new age of hip hop\n\\\\ Despite hip hop\nand rap artists\ngiving their troubled\nlisteners something\nand someone to\nrelate to, this hasn\u2019t\ncome without\ndifficulty and\nbacklash \\\\\nmoney, diamonds and\nbitches, don\u2019t need \u2018em\u201d on\nhis 2011 track Yonkers.\nHowever despite hip hop\nand rap artists giving their\ntroubled listeners something\nand someone to relate to, this\nhasn\u2019t come without difficulty\nand backlash. Artists like\nChildish Gambino and Kid\nCudi have grown accustomed to a storm of critics on\n\\\\ Artists like\nDrake have been\nfrequently mocked\nfor speaking openly\nabout their feelings\nof isolation, jealousy,\nparanoia and\nirrationality \\\\\n\\\\ Antonio Rull\n\\\\ Mental health\nand hip hop have\nhad a difficult\nrelationship for\ndecades \\\\\nT\nhis is Peckham\nrapper Nathaniel\nThompson\u2019s first\nLondon headline\nshow, despite\nover 10 years\nmaking music. He says he\ncan\u2019t believe this is finally\nhere after all the aggro; it\u2019s\nbeen a long time coming.\nCommonly known as Giggs,\nhis accolades include BET\nbest hip hop artist UK, and\nhis latest album debuted at\nnumber 2. Previous London\nshows are not missing due\nto a lack of interest \u2013 the\nForum is sold out and the\ncrowd are enthusiastic.\nUpon entry, it is clear that\nsecurity is a concern; ticket\nholders are subjected to\nthorough bag checks and\nasked to put all metal objects\nin a clear plastic bag, then\nwaved over with metal\ndetectors. Inside, security\nguards litter the crowd. These\nconcerns are not just due\nto a particularly energetic\nmosh pit, but probably due to\nGiggs\u2019 past in the Peckham\nBoys\u2019 Gang. Having been\nsentenced to two years for\nfirearm possession in 2003,\nand arrested again, then\nacquitted, on similar charges\nin 2012, putting on a London\nshow has come with some\nobstacles. Previous shows\nhave been cancelled by\nthe police, most infamously\nleading Giggs to upload a\npublic apology to YouTube in\n2013, sarcastically thanking\nthe police for always slowing\nhim down.\nThe show is based heavily\noff Giggs\u2019 latest album,\nLandlord. The set is impressive\n\u2013 the front of a block of flats\nwith dynamic silhouettes in\nthe windows coordinated to\neach track performed. Giggs\u2019\nlyrics, delivered by his trademark booming voice, get as\ndark and gritty as his subject\nmatter. Introducing Just\nSwervin, he says this is a song\nto light up to (but of course,\nnot in the venue) \u201cI put my\nmum through a nightmare\n/ But now she don\u2019t check\nthe news / Because her son\nwasn\u2019t out there / I\u2019m in the\nhouse with some houseware\u201d\nhe raps. Aside from this, the\nvibes are celebratory. Crowd\nfavourites Look What the\nCat Dragged in and Talking\nthe Hardest have the venue\nbuzzing \u2013 empty cups and\neven a tracksuit can be seen\nflying up above the moshpit.\nThe party vibe intensifies with\nthe arrival of grime royalty\nKano, JME and Skepta.\nIconic performances of 3\nWheel-ups, Man Don\u2019t Care\nand It Aint Safe are followed\nby Whipping Excursion, the\ncurrent single from Landlord.\nGiggs is joined on stage by\nall performers of the show\nfor the finale, celebrating as\nconfetti cannons fire. All in\nall, a triumph.\nGiggs at\nO2 Forum\nKentish Town\nTry he sings \u201cI believe that\nmarriage isn\u2019t between a man\nand woman, but between\nlove and love\u201d. Since, Ocean\nhas received praise for his\nmusical work and efforts to\nchallenge the norms within\nthe inner circle of musicians\nand tastemakers.\nOn Real Friends we hear\nKanye West, a man notorious\nof isolation. The track opens\nwith Kanye asking questions,\nwhich appear to emerge\nfrom a deeply seated anxious\npsyche; \u201cReal friends, how\nmany of us? / How many of\nus, how many jealous? / Real\nfriends / It\u2019s not many of us,\nwe smile at each other / But\nhow many honest? / Trust\nissues\u201d. In this case what is\nbeing said isn\u2019t particularly\nprofound no matter how\nhonest, but what is important\nis who appears to be speaking about these issues. For\nartists like Kanye West to rap\nabout his anxieties to the millions of listeners who tuned in\nto the release of Life of Pablo\nis a reflection of a time where\nthat has been deemed more\nacceptable and a time where\npraise has started to replace\nbacklash.\nOn his album To Pimp A\nButterfly, Kendrick Lamar\nfeatures a track titled i, where\na percussion heavy 70s\nsoul groove is paired with a\nchorus of voices singing the\nlead hook \u201cI love myself / Illuminted by the hand of God,\nboy don\u2019t be shy / I love\nmyself / One day at a time\u201d.\nHere Kendrick brings something slightly more refreshing\nand previously lacking to\nthe table. Instead of simply\noffering listeners the chance\nto relate to his troubles and\nstruggles, he also offers to\npick them up with a message\non sleeplessness in the digital\nage (as on Melatonin), isolation in a hyper-connected\nworld, racial and political\ntensions (The Donald) as well\nas dealing with mourning\nand death. Throughout the\nalbum, Phife Dawg, Q-Tip,\nAli Shaheed Muhammad and\nJarobi White do what drew\nfans to the group in the first\nplace: delivering an honest\nreflection of time we live in\nand standing by it. This is\nexactly what hip hop and rap\nmusic has always stood for.\nBe it good or bad, for better\nor for worse, truth and honesty have always held center\nstage such for artists of the\ngenre. And so, with global\nshift in attitudes towards\nacceptance and diversity\nbecoming more prominent\nand widespread, we can\nonly expect these genres of\nmusic to be at the forefront of\nchanneling this progressive\nchange, with better things to\ncome for artists and listeners\nalike.\n\\\\ Frank Ocean\nspoke very openly\nabout being gay in\nthe rap industry \\\\\nfor his self proclaimed\ngod-status, put his ego in\nthe back seat to discuss trust\nissues and a looming sense Mazen Almaskati\nSimran Kukran\n\\\\ Shane Hirschman\nof positivity and a reminder to\nlove oneself.\nA few days ago, hip hop\npioneers A Tribe Called Quest\nreleased We Got It From\nHere\u2026, their latest 16 track\nalbum featuring verses from\nthe remaining three members\nand the late founding member\nof the group Phife Dawg.\nThe album is a mind-bending\nexcursion through troubles of\nour modern day, with focuses\n\\\\ Eli Watson\nIs hip-hop finally casting the spotlight on mental health\nissues, violence and gender identity?\n\n"

His\ninfluence reaches far and\nwide: people have named\neverything from rock bands to\nsubatomic particles after his\nwriting. Joyce was something\nof an enigmatic figure (his last\nwords were \u201cDoes nobody\nunderstand?\u201d), and the only\nthing more inscrutable than\nthe man himself was his\nwork. Ulysses was banned\nfor a long time in most of\nthe English-speaking world\nbefore being named by\ncritical consensus as \"the\nmost important novel in the\nEnglish language\". Finnegans\nWake, his masterpiece that\ntook seventeen years to write,\nhas been called \"the most\ncolossal leg-pull in literature\",\nand has even been compared\nto Egyptian hieroglyphics.\nDubliners, his collection\nof fifteen short stories, is a\npioneering work of modern-ism. Quietly innovative, the\ncollection redefined how\nstories could be told. In it,\nnationalism and naturalism\nblend; instead of a conventional beginning in the thick\nof it, the stories start long\nbefore the action; the climax,\nrather than a final act of\nshowdown in blazing gunfire\nis in internal 'epiphany'. The\ntension and emotion in these\nsmall moments of quiet inspection deliver an emotional gut\npunch that lingers long after\nthe reader has put down the\nbook.

Araby, one of the\nmost readable stories in the\ncollection, is a simple tale of\na boy who is infatuated with a\nbeautiful but inaccessible girl.\nFilled with a sense of chivalry\nand honour, he idolises her as\na goddess. Hoping to win her\nlove with a gift, overcoming\nthe obstacles thrown his way,\nhe travels to the exotic, faraway bazaar, Araby. When\nhe arrives, it\u2019s too late; the\nbazaar has closed.

What silly\nromantic idea has driven him\nto such a pointless journey?\nThe story ends in this moment\nof disillusionment.\nIf it feels like I have given\naway the plot, worry not.\nJoyce\u2019s stories are not about\nthe plot, and the climaxes are\nnot about such-and-such hap-pening, rather, they are about\nnothing happening, about\nbeing stopped in one\u2019s tracks\nin a way that only sudden\ninaction can bring about.\nThere is no flashy twist-end-ing, rather, it is almost as\nif the characters suddenly\nrealise they are mere automatons written into a story,\nand all their motivations and\ndrives are devoid of any real\nmeaning.

The writing is\nnot tragic but melancholic;\nwith this bittersweet, sheer\nshadow of an emotion, Joyce\nexplores the full range of\nhuman feeling.

(We\u2019ve paraphrased some of the boring\nUnion language, don\u2019t worry)\nTeaching\n1. Staff should work with\nstudents to improve teaching\n2. Give credit to exceptional\nlecturers and allow them the\nfreedom to try innovative\nteaching methods\n3. Students should be given\nthe opportunity to act as\nteaching consultants.\nAssessment and Feedback\n4. Traffic Light system to\nforce feedback to be timely\n(two weeks late equals red)\n5. Departmental leader(s)\nshould be responsible for\noverseeing the quality of\nfeedback, interacting with\nAcademic Reps and students.\n6. Students and staff should\nwork closely to co-design\nassessment/feedback\nAcademic Support\n7. Continue developing the\nPersonal Tutor system,\n\\\\ The most satisfied\ndepartment is\nCivEng (96%) with\nPhysics bringing up\nthe rear (67%) \\\\\nSo what is the NSS?\nThe National Student Survey\nis kind of self explanatory:\nfinal year students complete\na survey just before they\ngraduate, rating the university\nin several categories. 23\nquestions cover the eight\ncategories of \u2018Teaching\u2019,\n\u2018Assessment and Feedback\u2019,\n\u2018Academic Support\u2019, \u2018Organisation and Management\u2019, \u2018\nLearning Resources\u2019, \u2018Personal\nDevelopment\u2019, and \u2018 Students\u2019\nUnion\u2019. These then show\nCollege and the Union where\nthey need to up their game,\nrelative to either themselves\nor the wider university world.\nAnd what did the NSS\nsay this year?\nBasically in six of the\nsectors Imperial is below\nthe average score with only\n\u2018Learning Resources\u2019 and\n\u2018Student\u2019s Union\u2019 bucking the trend. Learning\nresources also ranks us 11th\nin the country and the rest\nof the categories place us\nanywhere from 56th\nto a worrying 151st\n(out of 157 Higher\nEducation Institutions). Overall our satisfaction was 83%\nwhich sounds pretty good\nuntil you realise this puts\nus 114th, with the national\naverage being 86%. It\u2019s also\na 5% drop from ourselves a\nyear ago. The most satisfied\ndepartment is CivEng (96%)\nwith Physics bringing up\nthe rear (67%). Physics also\ndropped the most from last\nyear, a decrease of 20% in\nsatisfaction, quite the drop.\nSo what are the plans\nto solve this?\n10. Provide termly timetables in advance of term start\ndates (i.e. stick to the actual\nCollege policy)\nLearning Resources\n11. Look at how best to use\nspace within college, especially at busy times\n12. Make sure facilities are\nstill world-class and push\nutilising digital technology for\nlearning too\npossibly via a Personal Tutor\nnetwork. Consider splitting\nthe academic and pastoral\ncare aspects of the role.\n8. Standardise the administration around mitigating\ncircumstances\nOrganisation and\nManagement\n9. Compile all deadlines that\na student may have, in order\nto spread them out evenly\n\\\\ Compile all\ndeadlines that a\nstudent may have,\nin order to spread\nthem out evenly \\\\\nPersonal Development\n13. Ensure all departments\nagree a minimum amount\nof free time for students.\nDecided by Faculty working\nclosely with students.\n14. Make sure the skills\nemployers want are in\nmodules\nThe Union\n15. Look at how to tell the\nstudents what the Union is\nactually doing.\n16. Find how to engage students and allow them to make\nthe changes they want.\nWhat does it all mean?\nThis all depends on whether\nthe recommendations are\nactually adhered to once\nenacted and are actually\nworthwhile. What the declining student satisfaction does\nmean is that it effects our\noverall ranking as a univer-sity. This has the potential to\neffect our place within the\nTeaching Excellence Framework (TEF), the government\npolicy which means your\ntuition fees rise by \u00a3250 next\nyear. So that might change\nshould Imperial keep falling.\n\n"

Stop\nwhining and bow down to your\nnew master. I mean President. Not\nracist.\nO\nkay, give me a\nsecond. I just\nneed to mop\ndown all the\ntears off of my\nkeyboard.

Bernie was just\nbetter \u2013 even though he didn\u2019t\nhave anywhere near the amount of\nCapitol Hill experience, or senior\nleadership experience, he was\nfunny and charismatic.\nAs soon as I found out, I\nmessaged all 40 of my Tumblr\nfollowers and we launched a\nprotest outside the American\nEmbassy immediately after I\u2019d put\nmy tofu in the fridge to marinate\novernight. How dare they allow\na person we don\u2019t like become\ndemocratically elected?

Although I felt\nvaliant in protesting something that\nhappened in politics that I don\u2019t\nlike, the actual idea of working in\npolitics and trying to enact change\nsounds a lot harder than posting\nthink pieces in my blogs every few\nweeks.\nThe biggest shock for me was\nthat my entire social media feed\nseemed to be totally against\nTrump, and all the websites that I\nread and frequently comment on\nwere saying he was really bad,\nand yet there was a mysterious\nelectorate that appeared from\nnowhere who wanted change.\nUm hello, did you not see the\npast eight years?

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nC O M M E N T\nWhat the Brexit\nruling means for\nour democracy\nCallum Hunter welcomes parliament\u2019s\ninvolvement in the Brexit process\nO\nn the 3rd\nNovember, the\nHigh Court\nh a n d e d\ndown a decision stating\nthat the Government needed parliamentary approval\nbefore triggering Article 50.\nWhilst the Brexiteers have\nmade an outcry, stating that\nthis is a breach of democra-cy, it is actually a vindication of the United Kingdom\u2019s\nparliamentary sovereignty,\nsomething they campaigned\nfor earlier this year. We must\ntherefore use this judgement\nto push the Remain camp\u2019s\nideas to the forefront, so that\nthey are not neglected as they\nhave been so far.\nThe government, that is Ms.\nMay\u2019s cabinet, believed they\ncould use an ancient law,\nknown as the crown preroga-law. The parliamentary law\nthat must first be overturned is\nthe 1972 EU communities act.\nAs a result, the government\nneeds parliament\u2019s approval\non their Brexit plan before the\narticle can be triggered. This\nis all down to the fact that, as\nLord Lester QC amply sums\nup, \u201cministers are accountable\nto parliament and the courts\nfor the way they use their public powers.\u201d\nThis all comes together to\nreaffirm, certainly in my mind,\nthat the constitution of this\ncountry works to serve the\npeople, and to hear all of our\nvoices.\nAlas, there has been an\noutcry, best demonstrated by\nnewspapers such as The Daily\nMail and The Daily Telegraph.\nThere were, and still are,\nclaims that the judges who\npassed down the ruling are\n\u201cout of touch with the country\u201d and \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d It is ironic then that the\nparliamentary sovereignty the\nLeave campaigners fought so\nhard for has come back to bite\nthem in a place where the sun\nhas certainly never shone.\nThis ruling, however, will\nserve all the people of the UK\nwell. It will seek to serve not\nonly the Remain campaign,\nbut also the Leave campaign,\nas they finally have the \u2018sovereignty\u2019 that they so longed for.\nNigel Farage fears that this\nruling means we may be heading for a \u2018half Brexit.\u2019 I am\ncertainly hoping for such an\noutcome, given that, basically,\nhalf of the country voted to re-main. What is more, surely this\nruling is exactly what Farage,\nJohnson and Davis were hoping for, handing the power\nupon a large variety of var-iables. Everything from the\nwill of a party to whip votes,\ndown to conviction of each\nand every MP. However, what\nI can tell you is that Brexit may\nbe on course for a bumpy ride.\nAt this moment in time, Jeremy\nCorbyn has been unclear as\nto whether he intends to whip\nvotes in the Labour party,\nand it seems unlikely that he\nwould. If other parties follow\nsuit, and MPs stick to their original stance, then it will be 479\nfor Remain and 156 for Leave,\nleading to a complete halt of\nBrexit.\nThis may sound undemocratic and ridiculous, but I welcome it. In most other countries a vote of 66.7% or above\nwould be required to trigger a\nconstitutional change without\nparliamentary approval; or a\njoint vote between the people\nand parliament would be re-quired. Why is it then that only\n52% \u2013 a margin that could\n\\\\ Farage fears we\nmay be heading\nfor a \u2018half Brexit\u2019.\nI am certainly\nhoping so, given\nthat half the\ncountry voted to\nremain \\\\\nback to parliament. Unfortunately, the ruling isn\u2019t on their\nside. As a result, petty whining\nhas ensued from the right-wing\npress. As a consequence, the\npeople who wanted Brexit\nwould now like the power to\nbe thrust unto them and parliament left out of the negotia-tions. I call hypocrisy.\nThe question now is, what\ndoes this ruling really mean\nfor Brexit?\nThat question is a tough one\nto answer as it is dependent\n\\\\ The\nparliamentary\nsovereignety the\nLeave campaigners\nfought so hard for\nhas come back to\nbite them \\\\\ntive, to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary approval.\nHowever, since this law cannot\nbe used to affect parliamentary laws, Article 50 cannot be\ntriggered using the medieval\num of their MPs and lobbying.\nThis is a glimmer of hope.\nWe can finally make parliament truly work for us, and\nmake sure they are not \u201cout\nof touch\u201d when they make\nthe coming decisions. This ruling holds hope that we can\nhave easily swung the other\nway \u2013 is enough? Surely that\nis the unconstitutional thing\nhere.\nThe ruling is a welcome sight\nin a sea of never ending struggles towards Brexit. It gives\nRemainers the hope that their\nvoice will actually be heard in\nthe Brexit negotiations.\nI believe that we are on the\ncusp on getting a deal which is\nnot only focused on the Leave\ncampaigns ideals, but on the\nideals of the 479 MPs, and\nover 16 million people, who\nvoted to remain. With parliamentary approval needed, the\npeople can have their voices\ntruly heard through the medi-\\\\ Petty whining\nhas ensued from the\nright-wing press \\\\\n\\\\ If MPs stick to their\noriginal stance, it will\nbe 479 for Remain and\n156 for Leave, leading\nto a complete halt of\nBrexit \\\\\nachieve a \u2018half Brexit,\u2019 just like\nthe \u2018half leave\u2019 we saw on the\n24th\nJune.\nThis is an opportunity we\ncannot let go of, we must utilise it and push our agenda\nforward to parliament. We\nhave seen that the constitution of this country is alive\nand kicking, despite the leave\ncamp\u2019s attempts to suppress it,\nso we must use it.\nTo paraphrase the poet Dylan Thomas, \u201cwe will not go\ngentle into that goodnight.\u201d\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n404\n- FILE\nN\nO\nT\nFO\nUN\nD\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\nrepeated 24/7 the avalanche of\nlies directed at her for the last 30\nyears. Hillary Clinton was right\nwhen she said there was a vast right\nwing conspiracy against her, with\nthe media serving as an echo chamber for everything from bogus scan-dals, such as the nonsense about\nher emails, to blaming her and even\ncalling her an \u201cenabler\u201d of her husband\u2019s infidelity in the 1990s. The\nicing on the cake was the crazy\nTrump conspiracy of Hillary Clinton\nmurdering her close friend, Vince\nFoster, who had tragically committed suicide (which was confirmed\nby three federal investigations).\nIn the 1950s it took the courage\nof journalist Edward R. Murrow and\nthe respected army counsel Joseph\nWelch asking \u201chave you no decen-cy, sir?\u201d to shame Joseph McCarthy\nand awaken America to the division\nhe was creating. Sadly, today\u2019s media has no such stalwarts, and instead the corporate TV executives\nchasing after ratings provided\nTrump with over two billion dollars\nof free media coverage. Worst of\nall were the inlets like CNN with\ntheir pseudo objectivity normalising\nTrump by creating a false equiva-lence.\nHowever, the scariest contributor\nto the result is the fact that Russia\nhas been able to do what the Soviet\nUnion had never even come close\nto doing \u2013 placing a puppet in the\nWhite House. Russia just won the\nCold War 27 years after the fall of\nthe Berlin Wall. Vladimir Putin had\ntwo accomplices in his pursuit of\ndestroying American democracy:\nJulian Assange and the FBI.\n\\\\ Russia has just won\nthe Cold War 27 years\nafter tha fall of the\nBerlin wall \\\\\n\\\\ Trump won\u2019t have to\ncreate his own Gestapo,\nmerely inherit an FBI\noverflowing with extreme alt-right agents \\\\\n\\\\ The future of America\nlies in its youth, which\noverwhelmingly rejected the\npolitics of fear \\\\\nAssange\u2019s WikiLeaks which\nhacked the private emails of only\nthe Democrats, only leaked private\nmessages from within the Clinton\ncampaign to the willing media. Lastly, the FBI Director James Comey,\nbreaking with all precedent, violated the Hatch Act and used the machinery of the FBI to interfere with\nthis election. The reopening of the\npolitically charged email investigation only ten days before election\nday swung the pendulum in Trump\u2019s\nfavour. Trump has already promised to jail his opponents, including\nClinton, and destroy the independence of the judiciary, so it seems\nthat Trump won\u2019t have to create his\nown Gestapo, but merely inherit an\nFBI overflowing with extreme alt-right agents.\nIn 1964 when the far-right candidate\nBarry Goldwater lost in a landslide, the\nRepublican party, instead of moderating,\ndoubled down on conservatism, and consequently went on to win the next five of the\nsix general elections. On the other hand,\nwhen the great liberal George McGovern\nlost to Richard Nixon for opposing the Vietnam War, Democrats accepted defeat\nand surrendered to the neo-con foreign\npolicies of Nixon, Reagan and Bush. Liberals must learn to be as committed to our\nbeliefs as conservatives are to theirs \u2013\nstanding up to Trump and pursuing social\njustice, international peace and diversity.\nAmerica is a great country, and the odorous slime of Mr Trump might stain it for\nnow, but as hope rises again the stench will\nwash away, because the future of America lies in its youth, which overwhelmingly\nrejected the politics of fear. This is the last\nhurrah for the racist old white man. Since\nthe revolution of 1776, Americans have\nendured horrors from genocide against\nNative Americans to slavery and civil war,\nfrom the Great Depression to WWII \u2013 and\nevery single time America has come back\nstronger in the everlasting pursuit of building a more perfect union.\nNow as Liberals, we must stand with our\nbrothers and sisters of America, who are\nin the front lines of this war. In closing, I\nwould like to thank Hillary Clinton and Tim\nKaine for running a campaign with hon-our, and especially to Mrs Clinton for her\nmany years of service for America and the\nrest of the world. Whilst the glass ceiling\nmay not have been shattered today, consolation may be found in the popular vote,\nwhich she won by a margin of more than\n200,000.\nIn the words of Martin Luther King Jr,\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to the mountaintop, and I want\nyou to know tonight, that we as a people\nwill get to the Promised Land\u201d. Therefore in\nthat spirit, nothing can stop an idea whose\ntime has come, for America will have a female president sooner than we all might\nthink.\n\n"

You\u2019re in decent shape, feeling good about yourself, and you\u2019re satisfyingly still just about able to hit\nthe same maxes that you could in the summer when you were working out every day. But then you look over\nat the guy working out next to you. He\u2019s ripped as hell; his biceps are bigger than your head, his abs could be\nused to grate cheese, and he\u2019s got the deepest V you\u2019ve ever seen. You instantly feel inferior, your arms now\nfeeling weedy and weak, and you vow to work out every day until you\u2019re hench, the way you ought to look.\nAfter all, who\u2019s gonna look at you twice like this?\nSo you start hitting up the gym on the reg, knocking back the protein shakes, and doing more and more reps in the\nhope of those sweet, sweet gains. You start to bulk up, muscles building and tightening, and people are impressed,\nchecking you out wherever you go. But the gains are disappointing: you keep looking over at this other guy at the gym\nand he\u2019s still way bigger than you. You ask yourself how you could get this built; you\u2019re never going to be good enough\nfor anyone until you\u2019re a big as him. And then you think to yourself: steroids may be the answer.\nAnabolic steroids are effectively synthetic testosterone\nthat stimulate the growth\nin muscle and bone tissues,\nwhich are taken by many\npeople to improve their\nathletic performance and\nto stimulate faster muscle\ngrowth. Steroids are often\nseen as as bit of a miracle\ndrug, and we would be\nkidding ourselves if we pretended that they\u2019re not being\ntaken widely both in professional sport and amateur\npeacocking.\nThere are dozens of\ncommon types, that are\nusually injectable or taken\norally, although patches\nand implants aren\u2019t unusual.\nThese steroids are usually\nprescription-only drugs,\nbought online, and used ille-gally, often in periodic cycles.\nThey all have two things\nin common: they do boost\nmuscle growth and repair,\nand they have some pretty\nnasty side effects.\nAs these drugs affect a sex\nhormone, they affect men and\nwomen in very different ways.\nBoth men and women are\nprone to paranoia, mental\nhealth problems, and bursts\nof anger (roid rage is real),\nwith women being significantly more prone to these\neffects around menstruation.\nAnd steroid addiction is no\njoke. After long term steroid\nuse, natural testosterone\nproduction ceases, making\nyou effectively dependent on\na supplementary source. One\nconsequence of this is atrophy\nof your no longer required\ngonads \u2013 shrunken testicles\nreally is a thing. As if that\nweren\u2019t bad enough,in men\nthey also increase growth\nof breast tissue, stop sperm\nproduction, kill libido, and\ncause erectile dysfunction.\nThese are not things to play\nwith if you prioritise your sex\nlife, let me tell you. In women,\nthey do kind of the opposite.\nClitoral enlargement, excess\nhair growth, and lack of\nmenstruation are all common\nconsequences, and well as an\nenhanced sex drive.\nBoth men and women will\nexperience some level of\nacne, balding, and steroids\nare known to cause liver and\nkidney disease, heart disease\nand enlargement, blood pressure problems, and a reduced\nimmune system. If you\u2019re using\nthem to build muscle, you\u2019ll\nget less athletically fit, and\nyour eyesight may suffer.\nAnd they\u2019re pricey as fuck\ntoo \u2013 that\u2019s your entire social\nbudget blown. But that\u2019s okay,\nbecause when you\u2019re this into\nsculpting the perfect physique,\nyou don\u2019t have time to be\ngoing out partying anyway.\nAnd it\u2019s all worth it for that\nglorious bod, right?\nAlthough women do take steroids, the stereotype of\nthe typical user is usually a man, because using steroids to enhance a muscular physique is a very male\ndominated thing. The physical image of masculinity\nis generally very desirable in men, while women are\nsocially pressured to avoid masculine traits in favour\nof the desirable femininity. The images of stacked\nmen that we\u2019re bombarded with as the ideal are not\nrealistic, with steroids no doubt playing a significant\nrole in producing this aesthetic.\nMen are under a huge amount of pressure to conform to this masculine ideal. So many men that they\nfeel that they need to bulk up to be seen as attractive,\nmanly, or to be taken seriously, and steroids provide\na route out of this insecurity with a shortcut to self-es-teem. Steroids certainly work if your goal is to get\nbig, but are they really worth it?\nWhat exactly do steroids do, though? And what\u2019s the\nharm?\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug use, visit\ntalktofrank.com\n\n"

Quite a mouthful, but only a thin\nveneer of what is Donald Trump.\nSo how did we get from Barack Obama\nto Donald Trump?\nTrump\u2019s victory can be attributed to four\nmain factors: failures of the Democratic\nparty, the incompetence of the media, external intervention by Russia and the polit-icisation of the FBI.\nHillary Clinton was correct; Trump\u2019s supporters do fill up the basket of the deplorable of American society. They are the\nheirs of the Know Nothings and the Confederacy of the nineteenth century by operating through fear. Yes, the Republican\nParty has, for over 40 years, employed the\nrace-baiting southern strategy predicated\non whipping up xenophobic white voters\nagainst all minorities. This is most evident\nin the disenfranchisement of poor African-American and Latino voters by purging thousands from the voter rolls in swing\nstates like Indiana and North Carolina,\nand by closing over 800 voting stations in\nDemocratic districts in Arizona and North\nCarolina. All of these were accomplished\ndue to the Supreme Court, in its infinite wis-dom, gutting the Voting Rights Act.\nEven with this ugly history of the Republican party, Trump\u2019s rise is still unprecedent-ed. The last four Republican candidates\n\u2013 Romney, McCain, Bush and Bob Dole\n\u2013 are paragons of virtue compared to this\nlunatic. Trump has emboldened the hidden\nracist vote and normalised it like nothing\nbefore, not even condemning the KKK. But\nthis was also the country that twice elected\nan African American with the middle name\nHussain. So, whilst the moral bankruptcy\nof the Republican party was in clear sight,\nthe failure of the Democratic party must\ntoo be examined.\nIn the end, Trump won the electoral college through his strength\nin the industrial \u2018rust belt\u2019 of Ohio,\nPennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the latter three of which\nhadn\u2019t gone to the Republicans\nsince 1988. In these states, real (in-flation adjusted) median wage has\nstagnated since 1980, and only this\nyear were there any signs of im-provements. This was in large part\ndue to the trickledown economics\nof Ronald Reagan. Ironically how-ever, it was presidents Bill Clinton\nand Barack Obama who pushed\nthrough significant right-wing legislation that the Republicans never\ncould, by neutralising the political\nleft. In the process, they also alienated the Democratic base.\nIt was Bill Clinton\u2019s legislation that\nderegulated Wall Street by repealing the Glass Steagall Act, which\nprotected depositors\u2019 money from\ninvestment banks. When George\nH. W. Bush failed to get NAFTA\nthrough Congress, it was Bill Clinton\nwho subdued the unions and crippled the manufacturing industry. It\nwas Clinton\u2019s crime bill that brought\nthe era of mass incarceration of\nminorities, resulting in the fall of\nAfrican American voter turnout because of the lingering resentment.\nIt was the Clinton welfare bill that\ncut benefits for the poor and thus,\nfor the first time in a generation,\nwhite working class voters rejected\nthe Democrats. It is Barack Obama\nwho has deported more Latinos\nthan any other president, so was it\nsurprising that Trump won as many\nLatinos as Romney did?\nHillary Clinton only received 55%\nof the millennial vote, which is down\nfrom Obama\u2019s 60% in 2012. This is\nbecause many young voters are\nfrustrated by Clinton\u2019s close association with Wall Street and her previous military hawkishness in Iraq\nand Libya.\nEven with the faults of the Democratic Party, both Barack Obama\nand Bill Clinton were great presidents and Secretary Clinton was\nstill an impressive candidate with\nexperience and espousing progressive policies in education, healthcare and climate change, let alone\nbeing the first female candidate for\nthe presidency in a major party.\nOne thing that is certain is that the\nmedia need to own this outcome.\nThis is their Frankenstein\u2019s monster,\nand perhaps the problem was their\ndiscomfort with the idea of a strong\nfemale leader.\nThe corporatist news media has\n\\\\ The media need to\nown this outcome. This\nis their Frankenstein\u2019s\nmonster \\\\\n\\\\ Trump\u2019s victory can\nbe attributed to failures\nof the Democratic party,\nincompetence of the media,\nintervention by Russia and\npoliticisation of the FBI \\\\\nHong Kong has\nbigger problems\nthan Trump\n\\\\ The government\nnow has the power\nto actually deny the\nresults of a democratic\nelection and \u2018post-select\u2019\ncandidates \\\\\nDon Y Ma discusses the recent attack\non democracy in Hong Kong\n\\\\ Bricks were\nthrown, pepper was\nsprayed, people\nwere arrested,\nfreedoms were\ncrushed. Just the\nusual in the Special\nAdministrative\nRegion \\\\\nThey picked a bad fight and\nare paying the consequences.\nThis is about the Hong Kong\ngovernment\u2019s inability to uphold justice, rule of law, and\nseparation of powers, which\nare core principles of a functioning democracy.\nFirstly, while the NPCSC has\nalways had the power to interpret the Basic Law, there are\nset provisions for this power\nY\nou think the US\nelection was the\na p o c a l y p s e ?\nTake a look at\nHong Kong.\nHong Kong\nrecently had its Legislative\nCouncil (LegCo) elections, in\nwhich two candidates from\nthe Youngspiration party, Leung and Yau, were elected.\nIt is important to note that\ntheir platforms focus heavily on achieving democratic\nself-determination for the future of Hong Kong. The two\nelected legislators then had\nthe brilliant idea of protesting\nthrough their oaths. Standing in front of a \u201cHong Kong\nis NOT China\u201d banner, they\ntook their oaths while replacing \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u201d with \u201cpeople\u2019s re-fucking\nof Chee-na\u201d, Chee-na being a\nderogatory term used by the\nEmpire of Japan against China.\nHowever, the Department of\nJustice suddenly filed for a judicial review of the chair\u2019s decision to allow for the second\noath, completely disregarding\nthe authority of the LegCo\nChair as well as the most basic of government principles:\nseparation of powers. Yet\nsupporters of the government\nargue that the Basic Law does\nnot explicitly mention separation of powers.\nRita Fan, a pro-Beijing politi-cian, stated that the Basic Law\nonly guarantees judicial inde-pendence, \u201cmeaning that judicial decisions should not be\naffected by the government or\nany influential people in Hong\nKong.\u201d Yet even before the\ncourt could make a decision\non the judicial review case, the\nNational People\u2019s Congress\nStanding Committee (NPCSC)\nused its power to interpret the\nBasic Law, specifically Article\n104 regarding oath-taking, as\nfollows:\n\u201cNo public office shall be assumed \u2026 by anyone who fails\nto lawfully and validly take the\noath or who declines to take\nthe oath.\u201d\n\u201cAn oath taker must take the\nTheir oaths were deemed invalid by the LegCo Chair and\nthey were due to retake their\noaths at the next Council meet-ing. This was not the first time\nthat a Legislator would have\nbeen allowed to retake their\noath.\nprotesters and the police, reminiscent of the Umbrella Revolution. Bricks were thrown,\npepper was sprayed, people\nwere arrested, freedoms were\ncrushed. Just the usual in the\nSpecial Administrative Region.\nThere aren\u2019t many options\nleft for the people of Hong\nKong. Accept the status quo\nand watch our liberties, free-doms, and rule of law slowly\ndeteriorate. Give up, and let\nHong Kong become the Chinese City of Xianggang. Or\nwe could fight back. The question is how? How do we fight\nagainst a growing superpower with a choking grip in every\nnook and cranny of our beloved city? Peaceful protests and\neven riots have proven ineffective in the past, so what\u2019s next?\nWhat can we do when every\nlevel of society from universities to the Legislative Council\nis segregated politically?\nI certainly don\u2019t have an\nanswer for these steeping\nquestions, but I sincerely and\nsolemnly hope that it isn\u2019t\n\u201cnothing\u201d. In the meantime, all\nI can do is helplessly sit here\nand watch my home slowly\nfall apart, brick by brick, law\nby law.\noath sincerely and solemnly,\nand must accurately, completely and solemnly read out\nthe oath prescribed by law.\u201d\n\u201cAn oath taker is disqualified\nforthwith from assuming the\npublic office specified in the\nArticle if he or she declines to\ntake the oath.\u201d\n\u201cIf the oath taken is determined as invalid, no arrangement shall be made for retaking the oath.\u201d\nSupporters of the govern-as listed in Article 158, which\nstate that the courts of the Region shall seek an interpretation through the Court of Final\nAppeal if it concerns \u201caffairs\nwhich are the responsibility of\nthe Central People\u2019s Government, or concerning the relationship between the Central\nAuthorities and the Region\u201d.\nNothing within Article 104 corresponds to those two criteria,\nmaking this an obvious step\ntaken by the Central People\u2019s\nGovernment to deny not only\nthe two legislators in question,\nbut also any other candidates\nof public office that they deem\nunfit, according to their own\ninterpretation. What makes an\noath sincere and solemn? This\ngives the person administering\nthe oath the power to disqualify anyone they would like.\nTrump may have said that\nhe wouldn\u2019t accept the results\nof the election, but the frightening reality in Hong Kong is\nthat the government now has\nthe power to actually deny the\nresults of a democratic election and \u2018post-select\u2019 candi-dates. Furthermore, this interpretation before the end of the\ncourt case is a clear violation\nof the judicial independence\nof the Hong Kong judiciary. In\nthe end, the courts will rule in\nagreement with the interpreta-tion, and this ruling will serve\nas a precedent for all future\ncases, effectively validating\nthe \u2018post-selection\u2019 method.\nThat night, between 8000\n(police estimate) and 13000\n(organisers estimate) people\nprotested against the inter-pretation. This devolved into\nviolent clashes between the\nment insist that the NPCSC\u2019s\npower to interpretation is written in the law, the interpretation has simply cleared up the\nmisunderstandings regarding\nArticle 104, and people with\nnothing to hide shouldn\u2019t have\nto fear an interpretation. Additionally, they argue that opponents of the interpretation are\ndoing so in support of the two\nlegislators\u2019 actions.\nBut there\u2019s the thing: I couldn\u2019t\ngive less of a fuck about those\ntwo idiots. This story has escalated far past the fate of Leung\nand Yau, whose political careers are without a doubt over.\n\n"
