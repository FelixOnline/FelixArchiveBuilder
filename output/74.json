Whan your correspondent want to Interview the\nChairman of the Athletic Clubs Committee he had\nto Invade the wilds of the lew Hostel, where he\nfound his subject in bed. \"Charlie\" Chester was\nBuffering from flu, after, we suspect, an excess\nof athletic pursuits. Though It may not be surprising since he spends his working hours in a constant temper at use room in the Bessemer Laboratory, which can only be entered through an air lock.\nJuan Stanhope Chester was born In a small fish ing village with a Spanish flavour in the Isle of\nUan. This start gave him a touch of the romantic\nwh i oh Is possibly the key to his character.\n\"Charlie\" went to school at King William's College in the Isle of Uan. He rose to prominence\nas a member of the 1st X.V and the athletics team,\nand he actually became a College Praepostor. After\na year in the Navy he came to I.C. and studied\nmetallurgy. Again he soon became noted in rug ger circles and has played for the R.S. U. and I. Ci\nteams regularly aver sino e. Ha has also appeared\nin the University ti am, After a season as Vice-Captain of the I.O. H.F.C., he wan elected to control the entire (porting\nactivities of the o ol leg eai Chairman of the A.0.0. Like many Mines men \"Charlie\" has travelled\nextensively and been in many difficult situations\u2022\nOn appearing In an H. S.U.b lai er and a cloth cap\nin Montreal, he was mistaken for a Russian Naval\noff ioe r and nearly arrested. In Spain his vigorous\nparticipation in' Fiestas is noted, particularly to\nthe point of bathing fully o lot he d, thus showing\no are ful regard for the Spanish laws on the sub j eot. The roman t lo influence in his life is demonstrated\nin his likes and dislikes. Of the former he quotes\n\"hunt ln\", shoot in1 and fi ih in'\"; poetry, a major\npassion, he ie a noted de ol almer of eu oh ep los as\n\"The called of lak imo Nell\", and also the important\nsub j eot of drinking. His tastes In this dlr so tion are beer and agua dien te. as for dislikes, he lists a series of female types. Those who cannot dance,\ntalk shop while wearing evening dress, are arty-or aft y, eat gs rl lo and lastly show bad taste in dress\nesp eo i ally in the wearing of short shorts when obviously not suited to them. This of course\nImmediately leads to the woman he dos s like. In\nthis he Is quite positive; vivacious redheads; she\ndoe ent allow him to be ln tere;, od in any others I Although he has taken no pains to disguise his\nChristian names it was natural that \"Charlie\"\nbecame known as the namesake of the celebrated\n\"Cheerful Chester\".

During this we met a marshal, Ian Smith of Chen. Tech., who was seen again several\nhours later trying to unwrap his Fraser-Mash from a telegraph\npole before the locals discovered their loss of oom mun lo ation. Due to the liberal application of highly polished ice,\nand the attendant bl if s ard, David'sA.O. took to the hedgerows and ditches with the say abandon usually associated with\ninveterate inebriates. Having crossed all our bridges many\ntime before we o a me to then, and collected sundry other required Information, we returned to Basingstoke Just before\nmidnight.\nThe ne xj j seo tion was a1 The 40 minutes allowed for\nplotting was a gross underestimate,and we were many minutes\nlate setting out.

The A.O. became completely cut of control, and\ncrashed Into the deepest part of the ford. This was soon\nfollowed by \"Incident\" number 2 when the writer nearly fell\nout at 50 m.p.h. due to his door opening suddenly. This was\nnot, as alleged, a deliberate attempt to leave the party'\n\"Incident* number 3 - David discovered that the only way to\nstop an one sharp bend was to go straight on and ram the hedge,\na feat obviously tried, Judging by the beh&gg led state of the\nhedge, by several o th nr drivers.\nthese incidents failed to remove the outward\no alm always shown by chief navigator Brian Steed; but.the\nnest one, No. 4, wh i oh was the backing of a large wall Into\nus, resulting In the removal of one near light, caused fia jah Tasuf to vacate his rear seat in favour of the author, remaking that one felt better In the front.

A broken cam-shaft proved to be the cause of the trouble,\nso we trooped back to London, by car and train.

List Saturday I.C. organised their annual ROAD\nRELAY round t ne2 j mile circuit in Hyde Park.\nA record entry fort ne race is ample evi de no e of\nthe ever increasing popularity of this event amongst\nthe Colleges and Universities,an event which, has\nnow gained some National importance.\nTne rao e was won in excellent style by Lough.oo rough in the record time of lh r.12m.28s. Four runners broke the old course record.the\nfastest time being recorded by J. KNOPF (Selwyn)\nwith a time of 12m55s, J.S. EVANS of 1.0. being\nthe second fattest with a time of 12m56s. The snow which, had caused some anxiety during\nthe week,nad completely disappeared and although\ncold the weather remained dry.\nA strong body of la uf fled up spectators were\npresent at t ne start and at 2.47p.m. twenty seven\nset off at a very fast pace down the lone mile\nstretch of Rotfcen Row.\n\u2022r he officials and spectators were kept well in formed as to the race positions by tue U. I.e. Signals department.\nThe first lap was an indicator that the course\nrecord would almost certainly be broken,when M. tty man of Southampton a a me within a second of breaking\nthe record.There was very little dist an oe separating\nthe lead.ing runners at this stage and Loughborough\nU.C.. Notts.and Heading Univ. were all within striking dist a yoe. Stewart of I.J. was 12th at the end of\nthis lap.\nAt the end of the second lap Loughborough had\ncome into the lead.apo Bit ion they held for the\nrest of the rao e.U. C. were challenging strongly\nat this stage and Haywood ran aver j good lap to\nbring Q.M. C. into #rd pla oe. Oldfield.a fresher, ran\nwell but dropped one pla oe. During the third lap Notts.and U.C. fought out\na hard battle Brown of Notts.giving them seo on d position with U.C. several seon ds in front of an\nimproved Sheffield and Q.M. C. Meanwhile Ansell of\nI. Chad kept 13th position. It was in the fourth lap that I.o. began to move\nup,a fine run by Mellor bringing us up to 11th position.Loughborough had now established a clear\nlead,with Nottingham,Reading,U.C. and Sheffield\nkeeping a fast pace behind.\nSo round to the fifth lap with John Evans\ntaking over from Mellor.The big catch up was on.\n6vans, running his best rao e for I.e. stormed round\nthe course in12 m56s to shatter the existing record,and gained four places.Notts.were finding\nthe pao e too hot and Bristol moved up to take their place.Reading were now in second pla oe and U.C. third.Trevor Bailey now carried on the good work\nand doing his fastest time of 13m10s he gained '\nanother four places to bring I.C. into fourth\npla oe, some 15 yards behind Bristol who had gained\nthird place by good running over the last two laps.\nPerhaps the biggest cheer of the day went to\nBill Pain the U. L.C.C. C.o apt. running for N.E.C. who came in last' by a clear ten minutes.\nMrs.Logan the wife of the Principle of the\nUniversity along with the Reotor and his wife\nwere present a i the tea after the rao e. Mrs.Linstead presented the cup and medals,and\nMiss B.M. Walker of I. C.W. A. presented Mrs Logan\nand Mrs Linstead with bouquets.\nIjinliiil mention must be.made of Alan Hartley whoa*\nbard work and efficient organising enabled tha after-noon, to fee a great suo o ess. WATER POLO CHAMPIONS. On Thursday 24th. the I. C.1st VI beat Kings\nCollege thus continuing an undefeated record for the\nseason; this victory brought us tha university Championship in the Water Polo League.\nThis excellent reo or d has bean achieved by close\nteamwork with a sharp shooting forward line, booked up\nby a defence wh i oh was always ready to move up in at-tack.\nTo date goals for amount to 29 with 11 goals ag-a in st.I.C. First Team :- Chasten, Clark,\nHemingway, HoAdam, Stewart, and Lampard.\nRUG GER On the morning of the France v England international\nthe 1st team defeated Nottingham University at Harlington\nby 6 pts to 3 . From the start the I.C. pack asserted\nits superiority and the three-quarters were well served\nfrom the scrum. She tackling of the I.C. backs has shown\nsome improvement of late and the wings,when given the\nball,looked dangerous. Nottingham opened the scoring\nwith a penalty goal, but after this I.C. dominated the\nplay Spooner touching down for an un converted try in the corner. I.C. continued to press in the second half\nthe match being decided by another Spooner try.\nThe 'A' XV,after a hard match, jus* failed to hol B the Vickers Armstrong's team- being defeated by 6 pts\nto 3. However the 'B' XV bewildered the Vickqrs second\nteam and won by the magnificent score of 30 pts to nil. Fillmore played his usual brilliant game.\nRIFLE CLUB.\nThis year the o lub is yet again having a highly successful season and has done well in both the leagues and friendly\nmato he s. In tha London University league they have 3 teams in the\npremier division and the 'A' team has won all its mato he s to\ndate, and Is well on the way to retaining the Engineers Cup\nfor yet another year.\nIn the Inter-University League the 'A' team again met\nwith suo o ess, and apart from losing to Cambridge, beat every\nother university in tho country, and so for the seo on d time\nin 3 years the I. U.L. Cup returns to I.C., the only college\nin the competitions. This has been achieved only by good\nshooting and a great amount of luck.\nThe 'C* team was formed experimentally at the beginning\nof the year, so that members oo ul d obtain mato h practice before entering the other teams. This team has shot exceedingly well and is at present second to London 'C in its\ndivision.\nThe friendly mato h with the Metropolitan Police ended\nfavourably, but they are awaiting their revenge when we visit\nthem in the summer.\n'A' Team. I.H. Abbott, J. M. Alexander, C. Bentley, B.C. Cope, FA. Lemin, T.H. Read, J.R. Ryder (Capt.) & S. P.O. Jasainger.\nIvan Abbott has achieved distinction by having an average of 99.7 in the London League all through this season.\nBADMINTON I.C. Badminton Club have three teams in t ne U.L. Badminton League,and so far this season the teams\nhave a one hundred per cent re or d.int ne league\ncompetition.Out of the thirteen matches played\nonly one game has been 10Bt6 only one game has been lost a friendly match\nwith Reading University.\nTwo of the best wins were agains. Oxford Univ.\nWoodpeckers and Cambridge Univ.,due mainly to the\nhigh standard of play of their first two couples,\nTony Walker and Graham Lawrence,and Neville Ginn\nand C.L. Yap.\nThe mens 1st VI are expected to win the\nChamDionshiDB for ti.e4th year in su joss si<M. TUDO\nIn recent weeks the I.C. Judo team have fought two of\ntho more important provincial universities. These were\nreturn matches from the Winter Term, when I.C. managed\nto win both without much difficulty. This terra, how ev er, both opponents were in strict training for a Varsi ty match, and the scores were more even.\nAt Oxford the first I.C. man became rapidly airborne\n- the result of two stomach throws. Cruse, Hodwell and\nMacpherson evened the scoring with taio to shl s,hare l gosh is, and kam l shl hog at arles. Burford made some good\nthough unsuccessful ren-rak uwa i a mig its url kom las hls. The result waa a win to I.C. by 6i points to 6.\nWhen Cambridge came up last Saturdaythey round a rather\ndepleted I.C. team. Seth did well to draw against a higher graded opponent, whom he had worried with some\nstrong seo ln age attempts. Williams was swift with okur la ahi hare l but waa finally sat upon by a larger opponent.\nRotgana a oo red quickly with his usual o ao to gari a and\nMaspherson brought some difficult hara igo s hls, the\nfinal score being Cambridge )pts.,I.C.i pta.

    "content": "FELIX\nAPT EXHIBITION Trout Stream Bernard Parker.\nArt as a hobby is very popular at I.C. as witnessed\nby the reo ent exhibitions, and more important, by the large\nnumbers visiting them.\nThe founder of the I.C. Art Club, Mr. Bernard Parker,\nis largely responsible for the increasing interest and so it was most fitting that he should give an Exhibition of his own\nwork - no small task.\nThe Exhibition was a fair selection of his work - oboe ots, line and ordering clearly outline his interests.\nHis painting makes a straight-forward statement, its simplicity comes from a direct and strong feeling, most\nevident in his still life groups. He has a rapid and\nsweeping technique, is capable and enthusiastic\nBoth oi\u00b1 and water-colour were used, the latter being\nused with a clean, clear freedom particularly pleasing in the\nlandscapes. Outstanding among these were \"Porthtowen\",\n\"Saltwood Castle, Kent\" and \"Trout Stream\".\nWith still life groups in oils, there was a tende no y to\nsee the original realities as optical eff eot s, failing to\nimpress the deeper reality intangibly underlying the sce nio. But to quote the artist himself, he prefers a rio her, stronger\neffect than nature, and the use of pure bright colours.\nPerhaps it should be that where a visual art is concerned a critic should try to subordinate his interpretative\nto his descriptive faculties - leaving the former to the\nindividual.\nThe treatment of \"seascapes\" - mostly small boats around\nChelsea - has a charm wh i oh shows the artists the understanding and feeling for his subject. Among these was a personal choice \"Boats\" (No. JO) - whose delicately soft\ntones differ so markedly from the other works.\nIt was an Exhibition well worth visiting - truly representing the high standards in Art at I.C.E. I.S. COMING EVENTS. There's no time like the present-Get your Saster Bell ticket today.\nGOING DOWN. ihi r ty nine stalwarts from Guilds and R.C.S. assembled\nin Exhibition Road at the unearthly hour of 6.45 last\nSaturday week to discover what the \"Miners\" see in their\nchasen profession.\nTheir destination was Betteshanger Colliery, near Deal,\n'iV.li oh was reached at 10 o 'clock. The stalwarts then\nchanged into a variety of \"old clothes\" ranging from boiler\ns. dt s to a very nice line in Gent1\ns Natty Suiting.\nAfter being supplied with lamps they de so ended2,000 i 'set into the warmth below. A half-mile walk, a mile\ntrain ride, and a farther very long walk along dark, dusty,\nand seemingly dangerous tunnels brought the party to the\ncoal face.\nThen followed a100 yard crawl along the fao e whose\nheight never exceeded 4 feet and was in p lao es less than 2\nfeet.\nSome interest was aroused by the knowledge that\nwithin an hour of the arrival of the party some of the\nwooden props suo porting the roof had failed allowing it to collapse Into the working space.\nThe coal-cutting machinery and conveyer belts were\ninspected, and then the long walk back to the train\nOn returning to the bottom of the shaft the party\nlooked at a modem e leo trio loco, in a newer part of the\npit. Then up into the cold again for a shower and belated\nlu noh( on the N.C. B.). General impressions of the visit were that the miners\nearn all the money they get, and that no-one would be doing\ntheir National Servioe \"down under\".\nH.E. P.

    "content": "FELIX\nFOODS UP VEY Over 300 people took the trouble to fill is our QueatiennA.tr* forms of last i a aue. This represents about one third\nof our air o ul ation and ana fifth of tha Collage population.\nIt is probable that many people who do not use College Rafeotoriea figured among those not returning forms, so that our\no overage of people who eat in must have been high. Equal\nproportions of returns ware obtained from R.C.S, Mines St Guilds.\nThe first four questions we asked were purely statistical,\nso that we o an show the results in typical statistical fw anion: Question I. Our first question was to find out whether people used\nCollege facilities for sating and if so, wh i oh ones.\nThe diagram shows how students from the three Colleges\nuse existing Refectories.\nKIT\nQueeniea\nUnion (U. D.H.&L. D.H.) Snack Bar\nBring sandwiches\nEat elsewhere\nDon't eat\nThe horizontal scale is proportional to the total number\nof students in each College, so that the areas are proportional to the actual numbers from each College who lu noh in that\nparticular way.\nQuestion 2.\nThe seo on d question was to find out at what time In the\nlu noh hour most people went for their lu noh. These results\no an be summarised in straightforward percentages :-GUILDS R.C.S. MIKES\nLunch before lectures finish 41 1\n*\n1\nLunch immediately after\nlectures finish\nLunoh some time after\nlectures finish\n46 49\n13 10\n40\n32\n28\nGUILDS R.C.S. m hoss202332564241243527 Question 3.\nThe third question was:- \"\nH \u00bb\nj w long do you usually queue?\"\nAgain the results o an be summarised as straightforward percentages :-Queue not at all\nQueue up to 10 mins.\nQueue up to 20 rains, or\nlonger\nThese results o an be analysed with those for the e er lie. questions. The larger percentage of Guildsnen, who eat in\nQueeniss, are those who usually queue far 10 minutes or long-er; ana those hardy people who queue for se me tine are generally those who gofer lu noh just before or just after lectures finish. Most people who are prepared to wait, and\nhave their lunch later, do not have to queue far their meal;\nhowever, in jaw era l these late-lu no her s patron is e the Union\nRefeotexy.\nQuestion 4.\n\"If more dining accommodation were available would you\nuse it?\". The answers to this question were pr act io ally un-a nimo us; people would use extra a ooo mmo dati on if it were\nprovided. With the new ref eo tory opening on March 1st the\nproblem is partly solved. Those people who would not use\nextra dining space appear to be those people who either bring\nsandwiches or eat elsewhere at present.\nThus it appears that extra dining space will serve to\nmake things more oom for table for those who already eat in\nCollege, rather than to oop e with extra numbers.\nThis is all the information we have room to print\nthi a week.\nNext week we hope to in o lude a summary of the general oom plaints against the present arrange m rats, and a few suggestions as to how they might be improved.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nCassandra wishes to thank her many admirers for the k inc thoughts and valuable presents despatched in her direction;\nshe wishes to express her disapproval of the FELIX reporter\nwho noticed half of her on the bar at a recent social occ as ion; and she is really much too pleasantly occupied to was t tine writing vitriolic tripe for FELIX. \u201e\nAyrton Hall Refectory.\nDear Sir,\nAs my duties as manager ess of the Refectory will end u March 25th1955,I should like to express tc the staff and\nstudents who have used the Refectory my very sincere than.'.t to all who have made my work such a pleasure. I owe much\nto the co-opera ti \u201en of the students who have always ii el ped to make the work of the Refectory go smoothly.\nI should like also to thank Mr. D.W. Hopkin for the\ngreat help and encouragement he has always given me. I could not say how much I regret leaving the dear old City\nand Guilds Refeotory after so many years.\nYours sincerely\n^u een ie.I. C. Union,\nFebruary 15 >\nDear Sir,\nConsiderable attention has been drawn of late to the\nharmful effect upon children of their reading, as called,\n\"horror oom i os\".I enclose a leaflet published by the\nNational Union of Teachers as I feel sure that you will\nwish to publicise the surprising fact that \"Felix\" is one\nof the publications listed therein as being harmless.\nYou will note that these publications are not \"recommended\",\nnor is the list unalterable, but even so, it should prove\na relief to many anxious parents of students at I.C. No doubt you oo ul d have \"Felix\" deleted from this list\nif you feel tales will be adversely affected by its presence\nthereon.\nI am, Sir,\nYour faithful reader,\nRoger Fisher.\nSir,\nIn and around the Union one frequently hears comment\non the lack of support given to certain college societies.\nIndeed the opinion is often expressed that I.C. is nothing\nmore than a degree factory turning out uneducated sausages\nwith B. Sc. stamped on the skin.\nUnfortunately the U.G.C.' s policy is not to provide\nnone y for building student hostels. Further the oost of\nbuilding suo h hostels is.roughly \u2022 \u00a31,000 per resident, so\nthat the oha no e of finding a benefactor to provide the\nrequired funds is very small.\nAs another solution we feel that extending the lu noh break to 2 hour*, for the whole week, would give some of the\nsmaller o lub sao hano e to attract more members. At the\nnone nt the majority of students spend a considerable time\ntravelling between home or digs and I.C. and so think twice\nbefore spending an hour or two here in the evenings, which\noften involves them in Biasing supper. However confronted\nwith a2 hour luna h break they would probably go along to\nfind what these ol usa do, and discover that they were inter-este d. Surely for all o ono ern edit is better to start at\na fixed tine every day ao that we nay hear no more the phrase:\n\"Oh, I forgot it was a9.30 day.\"\nYears,\nP. L.L.A.H. G. "

C.M. together organised a brains trust on Colonial Affairs on Thursday 17th. An impartial Chairman was provided by the International Relations Club, and the panel\nconsisted of Mr N. Macpherson, Conservative M.P. for ICumfries, Mr J. Johnson, Labour M.P. for Rugby, Mr J. Morgan,\nPress Secretary to the S.P.C. K., and Mr R. Mukerjee of\nLincoln's Inn. Only two questions were submitted in before the session began.\nPretty well all the colonies were covered by the\njue st ions, and it was amusing to see how the two M.P.s tried io il agni fy their differences of opinion. Mr Morgan's forthright analysis of the unrest in Africa was masterly.\nKenya, Malaya, India, South Africa, the Falklands, the\nWest Indies - all were examined in the short time avail a ble, and provoked much thought*\nAMERICAN EVENING The cries of \"Dozey-do .... Honour your partner\n.... Allemande left..\" wert; to be heard in the Snaok Bar\nuntil 10.^0 p.m. last Friday. It was all over the attempt\nof the International Relations Club to promote AngloAmerioan understanding. It started on Thursday with an\nI.r..C. sponsored General Studies Lecture which must have\ncome close to setting up a record - it lasted until 3\u00bb20\np.m. and finished with square-dancing on the evening of\nthe following day. Prof Newell1\ns lecture attracted an\naudience of 120 who gathered to find out 'How the Americans Got that Way.1\nThey found out. The lecturer showed\nhow the European and African roots and the early rugged,\npioneering en vi rome nt of the Americans all contributed\nto T.ake the -j ne ricans of today.\nThe 'American Evening', with the square-dancing\npreceded by films and a short talk on music (by a CanadianJ ) was thoroughly enjoyed by all present and high\nspirits were maintained until the end. It is hoped to\nhave more people attending these functions in the future\nand many who are not normally attendant would do well\nto change their habits.\nI fl\nRECTOR'S CUP BOXING TOURNAMENT The ring, hired from an outside firm, had appeared\nin the Snack Bar as if by magic during last Tuesday afternoon. For the first time in the history\nof the Rector's Cup the tournament was held under\nthe auspices of the A.B.A. who supplied the off ici als. This combined with the spirited crowd that\nwatched and the even more spirited boxing (?) of\nthe contestants made the evening a delightful and\nmemorable one.\nThe Mines won by shear weight of numbers; R.C.S. were able to produce only three, perhaps four, boxers and withdrew from the contest; Guilds could enter\nonly eleven boxers against the Mines' twenty-two.\nOf the nine fights between Guildsmen and Miners,\nGuilds won five. The following are the individual\nresults:- (Miners first) T. Aitken beat U. Best, (pts.); T.M. Kesjel\nbeat J. Chapman, (stopped 1st round); R. Lowson lost\nto R. Fillmore,(st pd1s trn d);J. Reynolds lost to\nA. Palmer, (st pd1s tr nd); B.E. Lowes lost to H. McKenzie,(st pd1s trn d);B^B. Young beat M. Gray,(pts).\nR. Kingdon lost to J. Baker,(pts); H. Huckin beat P. Southgate,(stp d2 ndr nd);H. Ramstad lost to h. Corbett,(pts); the pot for the best winner went to\nR. Fillmore.\nThere were also three bouts between Miners gaining them the six points which won them the match.\nTwo exhibition bouts were given by members of Battersea Boxing Club to demonstrate how boxing should\nbe done.\nThe boxing was entertaining if not brilliant and\nthe referee showed great discretion in stopping the\nbouts before anyone got hurt too much. One contestant was heard to say to his.opponent \"My God, I'mt is ed\" half way through the first round and then to\nask \"What's the score?\" after going down for the\nsecond time. Incidentally, Mr. Southgate wishes to\ncontact the man who said \" Box man, box \" as he\npicked himself off the floor.\nHUmore based Ms usual brilliant bout.\naF el/x goes HOME On Monday of last week honour was satisfied between Messers\nPultaney A Co. of South Kensington, and FELIX of Imperial College.\nOne o old winters day many years ago the sign-board shown in the\npictures earns to live in the FELIX cupboard. We never knew\nexactly how i to a a e there, probably it walked; at any rate that\nis our story.\nThe day we took it back was o old and windy, 30 we did not\nwait around for very long. The picture on the left\nshows the sign-board being placed on its hook. . The Asst.\nProduction Manager is doing the re-banging, helped by the Advertising Manager, while the Business Manager and the Editor look en.\nthe despairing hand belongs to the Features Editor, who is literally supporting the whale venture..

Mr. Peter Southgate has been elected to be the next Editor. Mr.\nSouthgate is well known to FELIX readers already from\nhis drawings and contributions as PAES. He carries with\nhim the best wishes of the retiring Editor.\nIn writing this kind of departing note one finds that\nthere are so many people to thank that it is difficult to\nbegin. First and foremost are the FELIX Board :-Paddy Clark, John Pownall, Alex Fraser, Geoff Grimshaw,\nJohn Bramley, Roger Sykes, Mike Turner, Bill aids on, David Hattersley, Bob Fillmore, Trevor Huthen and Julius\nKosky. ff it h out their hard work FELIX would never\nout at all. Thank you, one and all. In addition there are our regular salesmen, and\nsaleswomen too, and the kind people who come al omg on\nSundays to help. Then there are the people really behind the scenes, the young ladies from the L.C.S., and\nelsewhere, who so patiently type for us; and 'S 'll Vous\nPlait'.

J' The manner in which Mike Neale conducts Union\nMeetings with the maximum efficiency has already\nreceived appraisal. The last Union meeting in the\nphysics lecture theatre was no mean example of\nhis technique. There was only one thing wrong -he was wearing the President of I. C.V.

Instead of its usual theatre\u2014and\u2014buffet annual\nouting, the Hockey Club decided to hold a Binner\nthis year. Held on Thursday 24th, the dinner was also\nattended by Captains of the U.L. and U.C. teams, and\nwas a great success. There was much conviviality in the Bar afterwards, everybody buying the Captain a drink in order to try and get included in the Hol land Tour this Easter. Many darts were thrown, and\nsome managed to find their way to the board.\nili Two weeks to go for the Easter play by the Dram.Soc.,\n'^and Miss Jean Osborne had yet to have a single rehe a* sal.

A notable specimen,\na monument to his endeavours, is being worn by Dick\nJanes, ex-President of the Mines. R.C.S., who withdrew from the contest are inconspicuous but for their\nlittle white flags.\n|^ FELIX now has a beautiful new typewriter. It has\na lot of knobs and buttons which are considerably\nmystifying the staff but, although several typewriters are used in making up this paper, we reel\nthat the standard of print will be raised.\n* To quote the DAILY TELEGRAPH, Dr. Heywood, of\nthe Imperial College of Science and Technology\nhas been selected to s it on a Solar Energy Committee in Phoenix City, Arizona. Is he sure that\nthis IS a Solar Energy Committee - and not a dastardly attempt by the Second Year Mechanicals\nto dispose of him amongst the underworld of that\ncity?
