It is\nalso a country with a number of different racial groups,\nand some people are in the awkward position of being\nthe wrong colour. The laws are so designed that these\npeople \u2014 the black members of the community \u2014are\nobliged to minister to the needs of the whites. In their\neveryday lives they are restricted and degraded in everything they do. They cannot come and go as and when\nthey wish, they cannot occupy themselves as they wish,\ntheir families are frequently broken up, they are taxed\nin equitably, their labour is bought at ridiculously low\nrates, and their job tenure is totally unpredictable\nUnfortunately for some,\nthey live in the wrong\nplace. How is this pos-sib le? It is the policy of\nthe white South African\ngovernment that people\nwith different coloured\nskins shall live their lives\napart from each other, in\ndifferent places and in different ways according to\ntheir different traditions.\nHowever, the population\nof the country is spread\nout and mixed up in a relatively random fashion.\nThe policy Of separate development dictates that\nsame areas are solely for\nwhite development, some\nfor solely black people,\nsome for solely Indian\npeople, and so on. In the\ncase of the blacks, the\nareas reserved for them are\nknown as the homelands.\nOf course, not all black\npeople live in the home-lands; on the contrary. Almost all the able-bodied\nare employed in the indus-try, the mines, the farms\nand the homes of the white\ncommunity.\nThe black homelands\nare made up of poor agricultural land and are isolated from urban areas.\nBlack people living outside\nthe homelands and not engaged in serving the white\ncommunity will have to go\nthere, despite the fact that\nthey, and generations before them, have never been\nthere before in their lives.\nWhole villages have to pull\nup their roots, lose practically everything they\nown which is not much\nanyway, probably just\ntheir homes and a few\ncattle\u2014to be transported\nfrom the \"black spots\"\nwhere they live to new\ntowns in the homelands.\nOften they face years of\nuncertainty as to the\nfuture; usually they\nare only given a few\ndays notice before their\nremoval. On the day, a fleet of lorries arrives to\ntransport them. They are\ntaken away, to a place\nwhich they do not know,\nand dumped. They are\nusually left in the middle\nof nowhere, often as barren as a desert, at a place\nwhere there are no houses;\nthey have to build their\nown, although building\nmaterials are seldom pro-vi ded, and initially the\nonly accommodation is\ntents; where there is no\nfood and hardly any\nwater\u2014the nearest shop\nmay be miles away \u2014 and\nthe ground is usually too\npoor to provide even a subsistence economy in the\nlong term, let alone *he\nshort term; where there is\nno industry to provide employment \u2014 so that the\nmen have to leave their\nfamilies and become mig-grant labourers in order to\nearn some money so that\nthey can pay the poll tax,\nand to enable them to sur-(\nvive. Where there are no\neducational or medical\nfacilities, and even when\nthese do arrive, they are\ncompletely inadequate;\nwhere there are no sanitary facilities or power\nsupplies.\nDuring the ten years\nfrom 1959 to 1969, nearly\na million people were resettled in this way. Protests have been prevented\nby intimidation, and\nwhere they have emerged,\nthey have resulted in\narrests and prosecutions.\nThe land is overcrowded,\nthe population destitute\nand starving. Incidence of\ndisease is extremely high,\nas is the mortality rate.\nWhat is more, the homelands are closed to those\npeople by whom the South\nAfrican Government does\nnot wish them to be seen.\nCosmas Desmond was a priest at a mission serving\na% lack spot' in rural\nNatal. In 1969 the population of the village was resettled in the homelands.\nBecause of his awareness\nof the conditions of Limehill, where they were re-settled. Father Desmond\nmade a journey\u2014illegally\nthrough the homelands to\nfind out what things were\nlike elsewhere. He published his findings in a book \"The Discarded\nPeople\" (Penguin, 1971)\nand he assisted in the production of a film, \"The\nDumping Grounds\". \"For\nhis attempts to assist Africans, he was refused a passport to visit his family\nin England. For his pains\nin exposing the conditions\nin the African homelands,\nhe was put under house\narrest. He is restricted to\nhis house for a large part\nof each day; he is restricted in his movements outside his house; he is restricted in the number of\npeople he can talk to; and\nhe is prevented from communicating with some. His\nmovements are closely\nwatched by the police.\nOn Tuesday, 5th December, the film, \"The\nDumping Grounds\" will\nbe shown at Imperial College. All members of the\ncollege are urged to see it.\nYou may be shocked by\nwhat you see, and you\nought to be, for it portrays\na situation which can\nonly be regarded with dismay and disbelief by anyone who 'maintains decent\nmoral standards. In this\ncountry the Anti-Apartheid Movement and a host of liberation movements representing black\npeople throughout the\nsouthern part of Africa,\nare fighting for the rights\nof these people and the\nfight is being carried out\nwith guerilla tactics on the\nground of Southern\nAfrica; they are fighting\nfor the right to be able to\nlive a decent, normal life,\nwithout fear, without hun-ger, without being misused and treated like ani-mals, without being moved\naround like garbage and\u2014\nmost important\u2014the right\nof self-assertion. For many\nyears South Africa was a possession of Britain, and\ntoday our country helps to\nmaintain the regime\nthrough its economic associations. We must therefore bear a major responsibility for the situation.\nThe example of Cosmas\nDesmond should encourage everybody here to help\ncarry the struggle for the\nintroduction of justice\nthere to a successful con\nel usi on. TUESDAY, 5th DEC.\n13.15\nELECTRICAL ENG. 408\nFILM \u2014 \"THE\nDUMPING GROUND\"\nSpeaker\u2014\nSTEPHANIE SACHS,\nan ex-patriot South Africa\nAround and\nAbout\nStudent Britain\nArnold Rugby\nLSE BEATEN AGAIN\nOn Wednesday, 23rd November, City and Guilds\nRugby l st XV travelled to New Maiden to play LSE\nl st XV away to eventually prove that there are now 27\npeople at I.C. who don't think they are the best college\nside in London. The day was quiet cold with little wind\nand the sun by 2.45 p.m. was quite low in the sky.\nGuilds won the toss and elected to play down a slight\nslope in the pitch with the sun shining into the oppositions eyes.\nThe game started well and a good standard of rugby was produced with both sides struggling to gain\ncontrol of the play. Good searching attacks by Guilds\nnever let LSE settle down and with the forwards working well to provide a good deal of ball for the backs\nit was clear that Guilds were a match for this supposedly strong opposition team. Attacks by LSE were\nnot a real danger and the Guilds three quarters and\nback row forwards were covering and tackling tremendously well. Much of the play was in the opposition\nhalf, and when the first half finished it was clear Guilds\nwere in a strong position even though the score was\nstill 0-0.\nThe second half started with both teams knowing\nthat a big effort was to be made for at least 20 minutes.\nThe sun had by this time disappeared and enabled the\nGuilds team to match their game to LSE's without a disadvantage. Even though the opposition were attacking strongly it was Guilds who made the first score\nwith a penalty kick by R. Hughes to put us 3-0 in the\nlead.\nHeartened by this score, the Guilds team pressed\nmore and more, harassing and attacking well, and\nit was on such an attack that a loose ruc k formed near\nthe opposition's try line. A break by M. Rickard from\nthe maul resulted in him scoring a well deserved try\nabout 10 yd s out from the post. The conversion was\nkicked by R. Hughes to make the score 9-0.\nLSE by this time were a bit upset but they had not\ngiven their best yet at all. In the next section of the\ngame the play was very fierce with heavy tackles and\nrough mauling, which for the good of both sides the\nref brought to a quick end. The game was coming to\na close with LSE attacking strongly and Guilds defending well. However in the last few minutes, the opposition fly-half broke through our cover to score a try\nwhich was converted to make the score 9-6 which was\nthe final score when the ref brought the game to a close\nshortly afterwards.\nTeam : P.

The row was\ncaused because BJH had\nmade a recent tour of\nSouth Africa and Rhodesia playing to segregated\naudiences which, Leeds\nStudents said, implied\nacceptance of the apartheid system. The Leeds\nUniversity Union exec\nspent many happy weeks,\nso it seems, arguing the\npros and cons of having\nBJH play, and changing\ntheir position weekly.\nEventually BJH did play\n. . . to a very low audience.\nThe concert made an estimated \u00a3700 loss.\nStill at Leeds, Leeds\nUniversity Union made a loss exceeding \u00a37,500 last\nyear, Which would have\nbeen bigger had the Union\nnot dug into its reserves.\nThe Union's Finance Committee have warned the\nUnion that this year's loss\nwill exceed \u00a320,000 if they\ndo not cut back expenditure drastically.\nBRADFORD University Union has solved its\nfinance problem by telling\ntheir Ents to make a \u00a31,000 profit this year.\nTheir Union Council finance meeting lasted from\n6 p.m. at night to 8.45 the\nfollowing morning, and\nthey did not complete their\nbusiness.\n\"It seems that we are\nall living a Utopian exist-en ce, although perhaps we\ndon't appreciate it\", says\nPalatinate, newspaper of\nthe Durham Colleges.\n\"We have received not a grumble, not a quiet\nmoan, not even a hesitant\nsuggestion concerning life\nin Durham.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX November 28, 1972\nFELIX FINANCIALLY\nMore than four out of every ten householders in this country own their own homes.\nThe time may come when you will want to join them. But how is it done? And what are\nyour chances? We talked to an expert to get some of the answers.\nA roof over your head.\nIt's one of the basic pri-ori ties. And finding a roof you can call your\nown is one of the major\npre - occupations of people who are beginning to make their way\nin life. It's something\nyou'll be worrying about\nsome day, perhaps. The\nchances are that if and\nwhen you reach the point\nof buying your own\nplace, you'll be doing so\nwith the aid of a building society.\nWell, what is a building society? What does\nit do\u2014and how? Leslie\nPask is the manager of\nthe Norwich branch of\nthe Nationwide Building\nSociety, one of the biggest in the country. He\nagreed to stand in the\nfiring line while FELIX\nFINANCIALLY shot the\nquestions.\nFirst of all, what is a building society?\nPASK: It's an organisation which lends money to people who\nwant to buy their own\nhomes. Owner-occupiers\nrepresent about 45 to 50\nper cent of householders\njust now. But it'll probably be about 60 per\ncent by the end of the\ndecade.\nFF : is borrowing\nmoney from a building\nsociety the only way of\ngetting a house?\nPASK: Well there's always the pools . . . but\nfor the chap who hasn't got several thousand\npounds handy, the building society is the ideal\nway to get the money.\nBuilding societies handle\nabout 90 percent of\nhouse purchase in this\ncountry.\nFF: How does one\nqualify for a building\nsociety loan?\nPASK: If you're over\neighteen, you qualify.\nThat's the minimum age\nfor entering into that\nkind of contract. But\nnaturally, that's not the\nwhole story. More important is that the building society has to be\nsatisfied you can repay\nthe loan.\nFF: What yardstick\ndoes a building society\nuse to make that judge-ment?\nPASK: In the normal\nway, a building society\nwill not lend a sum exceeding three times the\napplicant's annual in-come. Or, put another\nway, the monthly repayments should not exceed\none week's income. Of\ncourse, they are rough\n\\nd ready guidelines.\nFF: So if, say, a graduate starting his career\ndoesn't start by earning\na big salary, he's had it.\nRight?\nPASK: No, that's not\ntrue. I personally would\nalways take into account\nan applicant's future\nprospects. If a young\nman demonstrates his\nforesight by wanting to\nown his own property,\nI'm prepared to make\nallowances for the fact\nthat he may not, on the\nface of it, have the\nmoney. Most building\nsocieties have schemes\nwhich allow, for ex-ample, repayment of interest only in the first\nyears, without repayment of capital. This\nhelps to keep a young\nmans' outgoing s in line\nwith an increasing in-come.\nFF: Supposing the\nman is married. Would\nyou take a wife's income\ninto account?\nPASK: Yes, in the\nright circumstances.\nWe'd have to be satisfied\nthat both have reasonable earning capacity.\nAfter all, if we handed a mortgage to a chap with\na low income and a wife\nintent on having child-ren, he'd soon be in a hell of a mess, wouldn't he? We wouldn't be\ndoing him any favours by\nhelping him put a millstone around his neck,\nwould we?\nFF: So you have to be\nsure we've got the\nmoney. OK, supposing\nour applicant had a reasonable job and good\nprospects. How much\nwould you advance him\non the house he wanted?\nPASK: Ninety percent,\nin some cases, 95 per-cent.\nFF: And suppose he\nhad to borrow the money\nfor the other ten percent\nfrom the bank. He'd be\npaying that back, too.\nYou probably wouldn't regard that very favour-ably, would you?\nPASK: You're right to\nsuggest that building\nsocieties are cautious.\nThey have to be. Once\nupon a time, they'd always insist on an applicant putting down his\nown money for a de po sit. It gave him a substantial stake in the\nwhole thing. But building societies are changing their thinking. For\none thing, the rising\nvalue of houses means\nthat the moment the\nowner crosses the\nthreshold, it's worth\nmore than he paid for it.\nThat way, he does have\na stake. That's why they\nwill consider people who\nhave borrowed everything to get a house. As I said earlier, the main\ncriterion is that the chap\nwho gets the mortgage\ncan afford to pay it back.\nFF: And where do\nbuilding societies get the\nmoney to lend?\nPASK: From two\nsources. From the savings people invest with\nus: and from the continual repayment of loans.\nFF: It is difficult to get\na mortgage right now,\nisn't it?\nPASK: Yes. The demand is outstripping the\nsupply. Building societies can only lend what\nthey have in the kitty.\nWhich makes it all the\nmore important for\nyoung people to start\nthinking about this now.\nRegular saving \u2014 even\nin small amounts \u2014\nwith a building society\nnot only demonstrates a sense of responsibility:\nit also puts him, as an\ninvestor, into a favoured\nposition when he wants\na mortgage.\nFF: Alright. Our man\nhas done all you want.\nHe's got job prospects,\nhe's put a few pounds in\nthe building society, his\nwife is on the pill. But\nwhat about the actual\nprice of the house he\nwants? Isn't it going to\nbe out of reach, any-way?\nPASK: Not necessarily. Look, three years\nago, houses were cheap,\ncompared with other\ncommodities. In the past\nthree years, they've risen\nfast, to about their economic level. They'll keep\nrising, but only to keep\npace With living stand-ard s.I think the peak of\nthe house prices boom\nhas been passed.\nFF: But it's not going\nto be easy, is it?\nPASK: It would be\ndishonest to pretend it\nis. But there are ways of\nhelping oneself. And the\nmost important is to\nbegin thinking about the\nproblem now. Start sav-ing.\nFF: But what if a building society still rejects an application?\nPASK: Then shop\naround. Go to a dozen\nbuilding societies. They\nall offer just about the\nsame facilities, but they\ncan be offered in different ways by different\nsocieties. Dig around.\nFind a manager who\nwants to understand\nyour problem.\nFF: So you'd say there\nis some hope for the\nyoung chap who wants\nto join the group and\nbuy his own home?\nPASK: Age has little\nto do with it. An intelligent approach has everything to do With it. Anyone who wants to own a house is being in tell i gent. After all, it is probably cheaper than renting in the short run: and\nit's the best way to financial security in the long\nrun. But whatever run\nyou have in mind\u2014start\nnow.\nCarnival\nIt's a pity that Jeff Beck\nwithdrew from this year's Rag Carnival (it's not the\nfirst time) because what it\nneeded badly was a name to\npull the crowds. Argent,\nalthough a welt-known band\nfailed to do this. They played a fairly competent but\nunoriginal set which nevertheless was well received.\nRod Argent is an accomplished organist and has talent\nenough for more than twelve-bars and commercial songs.\nThe bassist was solid and\nmoved about inciting the\naudi ien ce to dance. The rest\nof the band didn't make any\nimpression. Russ Ballard's guitar playing was insignificant and the drummer, although introduced as one of\nthe best in the country was\nonly average. Their set climaxed in 'Hold Your Head\nUp' which featured an excellent organ solo and two\nrockers, 'Sweet Mary' and\n'Keep on Rollin'. By this\ntime the audience were\nthoroughly enjoying themselves and brought the band\nback for an encore.\nEarlier the first band to\nappear on stage were Biggies\nwhom I unfortunately missed.\nRainmaker, an acoustic duo\nsounding a bit like America\nthen played a pleasant relaxing set in the J. C.R. They\nwere followed by the incredibly bad Ellis in the Great\nHall. Steve Ellis and Zoot\nMoney proved that they\ncouldn't sing and Andy Grobeck, from Frankfurt, played\nsome lousy guitar while imitating a fish. Zoot later himself admitted that they were\nonly \"pissing about playing\nsecond-rate pop and hoping\nfor a hit single.\" Steve had\ntwo broken ribs which he acquired in a fight in Germany\nthe previous week and had\ntaken two pain-killers before\nthe act.\nAfter Ellis it was a relief\nto listen to John and Beverly Martyn. John featured\nhis now famous echo-guitar\neffect. He achieves this amazing sound by fitting a pickup to his old battered guitar\nand playing it through a copy-cat unit and fender\nre verb amp. After Argent\nMike Absolam presented us\nwith the amusing adventures\nof Superintendent Maglagan.\nThis act for me was the best\nof the evening. The audience\ncertainly enjoyed him too as\nhe was brought back for at\nleast three encores. It's a pity\nthere weren't more people\nthere.\nThe disco sounded great.\nThe Great\nChariot Race\n(or Ben Hur has\nnothing on us)\nQuite a good turn-out on quite a nice day (though\nnumbers could easily be improved on if you realise\njust what a small percentage of the USK students\nabout 200 is). Anyways, or maybe several ways,\nthere were enough to cause the usual panic in the\nlocal pie bs, as a bed on wheels, not to mention amines man on wheels and other equally grotesque\nthings on wheels sped down Oxford Street (sped\nbeing the operative word).\nNo wonder the average gout ridden collector (too\nmany Mooney specials?) had a hard job collecting\nsufficient donations if he/she/it had an even harder\none of keeping up with the main attractions. If they\nhadn't have been going so fast, then many more\npassers-by would have had the opportunity and the\ntime to put a coin in the box (coins were even\nthrown at the entourage at one stage, whether in\nan effort of benevolence or rage was hard to dis-cern). Granted if the collectors had taken a more\nleisurely pace then they could have spent more time\nsoliciting (?) but then the people around them may\nhave missed the entertainment.\nAnother sore point (especially for the poor girl\ninvolved) was the overturning of a perilous mines\ncontraption which should not have been tried in the\nfirst place as it was obviously unstable. The end\nresult was a fractured skull and a stay in h osip tal, not a good advert for rag, especially as we were\ncollecting for crippled kids, and almost added\nanother to their number. So more care in future and\ngreater fun will be had for all.\nTo any interested sex-mechanics there were a lot\nof spare birds around (Institute Francais vintage)\nso a bit of harmonious tin rattling went on. It seems\nalso that they collected quite a sizeable amount\ncompared to Guilds measly \u00a318 (plus six missing\ncans), so being butch isn't everything.\nBeing Butch did count quite a Sot in the heats\naround Speakers Corner, where one or two lads\ncome off at the corners and rolled around in the\ngrass, all good clean fun. The vehicles involved\nwere also quite gay, clothes racks, supermarket tro l lies, pram s.... even Guilds bed had flowers on it.\nThe whole lot then went under Marble Arch subway\ndown quite a long slope which prematurely aged a bowler-hatted commuter walking the other way and\nproceeded along Oxford Street. Three collecting\napes were in evidence and one collected an umbrella laid over its back after scaring its aged owner.\nAt one point an enterprising policeman suggested\nwe travelled on the road, not the pavement, so\nalways glad to comply we moved onto the highway\ngoing the wrong way down a one way street. After\nthis things went from worse to bad and the procession broke up with Mines and Guilds efforts sporting back down Oxford Street (Mines won, but didn't of course have the comfort of a Grand Touring\nvehicle which the Guilds' bed offered).\nSplinter groups (sounds nasty) moved off collecting in varied directions, 'Clem' the Mines lorry\nbroke down, and everybody's hero the Felix reporter\nleft for home . . . .\n\n"

The roofing felt was\nold and cracked, bulging between two sup-ports. Beneath the bulge lay Phosphorous\nthe Jobrot, fast asleep. A smile decorated\nhis pleasantly ugly face, and his grubby\nsleeping-bag rose and fell as he snored.\nWith a grunt he rolled over onto his back,\njust in time to catch half a gallon of cold,\nleafy water in the face.\n\"Major catastrophe!\" he shouted, choking\nand spitting out bits of tree and root, \"dis-aster strikes lone Jobrot \u2014 help urgently\nrequired\". Fortunately, it was not a disaster,\nand when Phosphorous had woken up a bit,\nand calmed down a lot, he was able to look\naround his shed and take stock of the dam-age.\nA football-sized hole in the roof, and\nrather damp bed seemed to be the\ntrouble.\n\"Not so bad\", though Phosphorous, and\ndecided to get up. He struggled out of his\nsleeping bag, and pulled on his much-patched jeans, and King Canute tee-shirt.\n\"Time for breakfast\" thought the Jobrot,\nhis mind conjuring with images of corn-flakes, coffee and bacon. But it was riot to\nbe. A cold wave of reality washed over the\ncornflakes and bacon, leaving only half a jar of instant coffee\u2014which was all he\nhad left in his food box.\n\"Oh! Nasty things!\" he cursed, and sat\ndown inadvertently in the roof-disaster pool\nof water.\n\"Oh! Very Nasty Things!\" he cried, thoroughly disheartened.\nThere was only one solution; he would\nhave to go elsewhere for his breakfast. He\nwould go and see his friend Ferocious Din,\nand scrounge some food from him. So he\npulled on his Moggle-fur coat, for it was\nchilly outside, stuck a bucket under the hole\nin the roof, and set off for Ferocious' house.\nDespite his empty stomach, and the rather\ndepressing weather. Phosphorous felt quite\ncheerful. He began to hum a little tune of\nhis own composition, and gave a leap in\nthe air at the end of every tenth bar. It was\nalready well into Autumn and everywhere\nlay huge piles of fallen leaves. Phosphorous\nran, with a strange shuffling step, through\nthe leaves, shouting.\n\"I am the amazing Jobrot leaf plough\".\nTo his surprise one of the piles contained\na large lump of tree, over which he fell, to\nland glider-fashion on his nose.\nHe was not really hurt, but lay in the\nleaves for a moment, musing on the cruelty\nof fate. He was just dropping off to sleep,\nwhen he remembered what he was doing\nand where he was going. He got to his feet\nand headed breakfast ward once more.\nLeaving the trees, he could see Ferocious'\nplace in the distance and broke into a trot.\nLittle legs whirring, Moggle-fur coat flying.\nPhosphorous arrived breathless at Ferocious' front door. He read the brass plate\nover the door :\n\"THIS CONVENIENCE OPENED\nby ALDERMAN F. PAUNCH\n15th September 1895\"\nFerocious lived in a Public Loo. Most of\nthe fittings had been removed long ago, but\nthe walls were still tiled, and verdigris covered pipes snaked from floor to ceiling. At\nthe end of the main room was a small\ncubicle, which offered \"Wash and Brush-up\n6d\". Under the faded sign was a frosted\nglass door, through which Phosphorous now\npassed. Ferocious Din snored peacefully\ninside. He was a long angular creature looking in need of both services originally provided in his bedroom.\n\"Wake up, Ferocious\", said Phosphorous,\na little nervously. There was no answer. \"Oh\ndear\", thought Phosphorous, \"WAKE UP\" he bellowed.\n\"Don't panic, women and Dins first, remember you're British\", shouted Ferocious\nsitting up very quickly. \"Oh, it's only you,\ndear boy\", he said in more conversational\ntones. \"If you continue to wake me in that\nheart-hammering fashion, I fear our friendship may founder\". The lean Din screwed\nhis monocle into his left eye and got up.\n\"You were wearing that thing in the other\neye yesterday\", said Phosphorous, tact-less ly. \"Possibly, dear lad, possibly\", replied\nFerocious trying to'look haughty, \"the affliction is never constant\". Phosphorous knew\nthat his friend' wore the monocle for show\nalone, but felt it unwise to say so.\nFerocious was peering hopefully into his\nfood cupboard.\n\" A spot of breakfast, perhaps?\" he asked,\n\"That is what you came for I suppose?\"\nMuttering to himself Ferocious left it at\nthat, and set about pouring out the corn-flakes, and cooking some bacon.\n\"Gosh no, Ferocious\", lied the Jobrot, \"I An exclusive serial is ation of this new book by S.J. Swailes\nin nine parts starts in this issue of FELIX, and will continue\nweekly until the middle of next term.\ncame to see you\".\n\"This is great\", said Phosphorous, as the\ntwo friends sat in Ferocious' living room,\ndrinking coffee, after an excellent breakfast.\n\"Quite possible, old chum, quite pos-sib le\", murmured Din, his good humour res-to red. Hardly had he spoken than there came\na knock at the door.\n\"Enter\", said Ferocious, trying to look\nas much like a householder as possible.\nA short bulky individual came in. He wore\na long grubby raincoat, and carried, under\nhis arm, an old leather briefcase. From the\ncase he drew an official looking piece of\npaper.\n\"Are you Ferocious Din, occupant of this\nconvenience?\" he asked of Phosphorous the\nJobrot.\n\" No\", said Phosphorous, quite truthfully.\nThe visitor glared suspiciously at Ferocious.\n\"What about you?\" he said.\n\"Oh no\", said Ferocious, \"I'm his bro-ther, 'Terrible' \u2014 can I help?\"\n\"Well, I don't know\" replied the man,\n\"you see I. have this Summons for him\".\n\"Now you come to mention it\" stammered Ferocious, trying to keep the note of\npanic out of his voice, \"I recall he has gone\naway on a very long holiday\". But the Summons man was peering at the label on Ferocious' cloak where it hung behind the door.\n\"Property of F. Din Esq.\" he read, \"looks\nlike he forgot his coat, eh?\"\n\"He's gone somewhere very warm\", tried\nFerocious, \"he doesn't need lit there\".\n\"I don't be liev j) a word of it\", growled\nthe representative of justice.\n\"Neither do I\", said Phosphorous, momentarily confused. It looked as if there was\ngoing to be a nasty disagreement, but the\nsituation was saved by the strange plumbing in Ferocious' living room. One of the\nfinely worked cisterns which lined the wall\nteetered on its mounting and, still attached\nto its pipe described a precise arc and\nstruck the Summons man unconscious.\n\"Oh gosh, terrible things\", said Phosphorous, quite shocked. Callous Ferocious\nDin was not so moved.\n\"I was going to fix that\", he said, \"what\na piece of luck, it r night have fallen on me!\"\nBut Phosphorous was kneeling beside the\nSummons man.\n\"He's still alive\", he said. \"I can hear\nhis heart beating\u2014help me get him into\nyour bedroom\". Ferocious looked offended.\n\"I say, dear lad\", he protested. \"I don't really want strange chaps on my bed: you\ndon't know where he's been . . . . \" his\nvoice died away as Phosphorous leapt to\nhis feet, waving the Summons.\n\"Hey, look at this\", he shouted, \"it's not\nthe usual Loitering one, it says 'MAGIC\nSUMMONS' on the top\".\n\"You're right, dear boy, deuce d in trig u ing\", said Ferocious, snatching the Summons from Phosphorous' hand, \"let me have\na close study of this document\". Removing\nhis monocle to clear his vision. Ferocious\nscanned the Summons and started to read:\n\"Magic Summons; drawn up this Severalth day of Sometember, nineteen what ey few\" (Eh? said Phosphorous \u2014 \"It is a magic summons\" said Ferocious). \"The\nSummons\" read Ferocious, \"calls Ferocious\nDin and Phosphorous the Jobrot (\"Me too\"\nexclaimed Phosphorous, \"so it would seem,\nold son\" replied Din), to take part in an\nadventure of the highest quality. Adventurers are advised to roll the Summons into a tube of small dimensions and look down\none end.\n\"Well\", thought Ferocious, \"who do I know who'd think that send me a Magic Summons was a funny joke? He\nstared suspiciously at Phosphorous. But the\nJobrot was peering excitedly at the Summons.\n\"Come on, Ferocious\", he pleaded, \"let's try it \u2014 you know, roll it up and every-thing\".\n\"You try it, dear chap\", said Ferocious,\noffhandedly, \"it all sounds terribly boring\nto me\".\nWhile Phosphorous was fiddling with the\nSummons, Ferocious mentally checked a list\nof his friends for demented humorists.\n\" Um\", he pondered. It seemed too complicated for Phosphorous' simple mind, and\nyet it had his silly touch. \"Dashed puzzling\",\nthought the un trusting Din. If it wasn't the\nJobrot then it had to be the appalling Crispin Toads, whose strange sense of humour\nhad given Ferocious a lot of.trouble in the\npast. It had been Crispin who had sent Ferocious a postcard, expressing condolences\non the death of his pet worm, \"Tonsil\" purportedly from the Queen. Din had just been\ncomposing an appropriate reply to Her Ma>\nest y when he had noticed that the original\nwas postmarked \"Wandsworth\". Yes it had\nto be that objectionable Toads behind this\nlatest unlikely scheme. \"What sort of idiot\ndoes the nasty fellow think Iam?\" thought\nFerocious, \"Magic Summons indeed \u2014\npathetic!\" He was plotting something fitting\nas a Crispin-fool er when Phosphorous let out\na yell.\n\"Hey!\" he shouted, \"Treble Hey, ooh, ooh\nFerocious look, look, look at this\". He was\npeering down the rolled up Summons, and\nwaving his arms about.\n\"Restrain yourself, dear boy\", murmured\nFerocious, thinking that perhaps Phosphorous had got something to do with this silly\nbusiness after all \u2014 he was hamming it up\nso much.\n\"No, look\", said Phosphorous. \"I can see\nsomewhere else down the Summons!\"\n\"Come, come old friend\", said Din, re-assuring ly, \"all you should be able to see\ndown that thing is the none too salubrious\nwall of my living room\".\n\"Just look\", said Phosphorous, thrusting\nthe rolled Summons into Ferocious' hand.\nSlowly, and with an air of total unconcern.\nFerocious raised the Summons to* his un-mono oled eye.\n\"Well, I 'll be disinfected\", he gasped. His\nmonocle dropped, and swung on its string.\nThrough the rolled-up Summons Ferocious\ncould see a long sandy beach fringed with\npalms, not unlike an advertisement in the\nSunday Times Colour Magazine. \"I remain\nspeechless, dear chum, I am without com-ment\", said a pale Ferocious.\n\"Pretty fantastic isn't it?\", said Phosphorous.\n\"Very splendid\", replied Ferocious, lowering the Summons from his eye, \"but it\ndoesn't really get us anywhere, does it? I mean, it's a lovely party trick, done no doubt\nwith the proverbial mirrors, but it has no\nreal function, has it?\" Phosphorous could\nthink of no immediate answer to this, but\nhe was still delighted with the Summons\neven if it was only a toy.\n\"Let me have another go, Ferocious?\"\nhe pleaded, \"please\".\n\"Just a moment, dear boy, I am studying\nthe phenomenon a little closer\", Phosphorous could contain himself no longer, and\nreaching over to Ferocious, he stood on tiptoe and looked down the free end of the\nSummons.\n\"Oh lovely\", he said, as the beach reappeared before him.\nThe two friends stood for a moment facing each other, looking down opposite ends\nof the Magic Summons. Gradually the light\nbegan to dim, the tiled walls began to\nwaver and wobble \u2014to seem less like walls\nthan curtains. Suddenly, with a brilliant flash\nof light, and a giant's breath rush of air,\nthe curtains were flung aside and vanished\ncompletely \u2014 leaving Phosphorous and Ferocious standing on the beach.\nThe two stood in silence for a moment,\nstaring about in wonder.\n\"I feel I must sit down\", said Ferocious,\nand did.\n\"This is really tremendous\", said the\neasy-going Jobrot, running his fingers\nthrough the sand, and stretching in the sun.\n\"Better than your chilly old living-room,\nisn't it?\"\n\"It's not a question of that, dear boy\",\ncomplained Ferocious. \"I object to being\nwhisked from the middle of my living-room\nfloor onto this nasty beach, without any consultation whatsoever. Besides I never got a chance to cancel the papers\".\n\"Don't fuss so much\", said Phosphorous,\n\"the adventure has started\".\n\"So, dear lad, it would seem\", said\nFerocious, un enthusiastically. emo s ah\noli day in California...\nWITH NO HOTEL EXPENSES\nEXCHANGE YOUR FLAT, ROOMS OR\nHOME WITH A HOLIDAY FRIEND OR\nRENT OUT YOUR PRESENT\nACCOMMODATION TO VISITORS\nFROM AMERICA OR\n\u2022 SPECIAL STUDENT\nEXCHANGES, BY TERM OR\nYEAR, INCLUDING\n^d>i ENROLMENT, all arranged by\n^ INTERNATIONAL\nHOSPITALITY SERVICE\nNon profit making society\nrepresented in San Francisco,\nto arrange exchange holidays.\n1\n1\nIII11 IV Send coupon or telephone for free colour brochure.\nTO: INTERNATIONAL HOSPITALITY SERVICE \u2022ep tj,97 Chancery Lane, London WC2 A1AF.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX November 28,1972\nLetters\nto the Editor\nCEFE\nand tin*\nJews\nSir,\u2014/ read with interest\nthe article in CEFE (not the\narticle in the new opinion\npage of Felix) regarding\nletter bombs vis a vis Arab\nTerrorists and Israeli \"ter-r or is ts\". The article basically\nstates that the letter bombs\nhave been organised by the\nIsraeli Government and associated Zionist organisations\nin an attempt to bring the\nBlack September Movement\nand other admitted terrorist\norganisations into disrepute.\nI cannot argue with their\n\"facts\". I assume CEFE is\nthe omnipotent power of\ntruth, i.e.I give them the\nbenefit of the doubt.\nHowever, I do question\ntheir logic. Am I to believe\nthat some arbitrary Jews are\nlying 6 feet under due to\nsome arbitrary propaganda\norganised by some arbitrary\nforces within Israel? Am f to believe that the Israeli\nGovernment has hired alleged\nArabs (or well-disguised\nJews; the resemblance as a race, and not a religion, is\nnot coincidence) to hijack\nplanes? Am I to believe the\nIsraeli government sacrificed\nits athletes in Munich as a propaganda exercise? Am I to\nbelieve that God-knows-how many Jews were gassed in\nGermany as a political exercise in propaganda, or that\nthe persecution of the Jewish\nrace in the Bible (taken as\nan important historical document and not as mere re li gion. A great deal of it has\nbeen substantiated from\nother sources) is yet another\ncon? Perhaps the Jews drove\n' themselves from Egypt and\ndrowned half of their number\nin the Red Sea.\nI await a reply from CEFE\nsaying \"Yes!\" Come on bud-dies, be realistic, emerge\nfrom your naivet e. Of course, the nation of\nIsrael is surrounded by criticism and opposition. Perhaps\nthe decisions made in 1916\nand 1948 were wrong. But,\nalas, the population of Israel\nis 100% behind the Israeli\ngovernment's attitudes towards the surrounding Arab\ncountries. Sorry, I neglected\nthe Palestinian refugees, Why\ndon't the Arab nations offer\nto help the refugees? Is it\nbecause they would lose a political weapon, one of the\nvery few they have? Why\nalso don't the Israelis give\nback the territories they won\nin their little sortie of 5 years\nago? Yeah, sure. And leave\nthemselves open to the same\nkind of genocide threat as\nbefore. It is always said that\nJews aren't stupid; in this\ncase they certainly are not.\nOf course, whose land is\n\"Israel\"? Well let me say\nthis:\nAll \"Europeans\" get out of\nAmerica, leave it to the \"In-dian s\". \"Indians\", get out\nof America, back across the\nAlentian Islands, back to\nAsia from whence you came.\nLeave America to the\nBuffalo.\nEnglish, get out of England, back to the Continent\n(what price the EEC now,\nbuddy? ).\nIrish, you can solve all\nyour problems, come back\nto England with the Welsh\nand Scots, this is your co un try, but you ran away. Cape\nColoureds of South Africa,\nsend the whites back to\nEurope, and once they have\ngone, go back to your own\nlands further north.\nTime is a great healer, my\nfriends, I hope you can survive long enough to heal\nyourselves.\nYours T.T.C. C.H* Paul Jowitt.\n\"The Felix linguistic expert says that these hieroglyphs probably mean \"Till\nthe cows come home\", but it\nis open to other interpretations. Lager:\nfurther\nopinions\nSir,\u2014/ would like, first of\nall, to congratulate and thank\nMr. Martin Doughty for his\narticle, \"The Great Lager\nRip-Off\", which is more than\noverdue, it only being a pity\nthat his enlightenment should\nbe limited to students of I.C. May I, however make two\npoints:\n1) To be fair to the name\nof Carlsberg we must differentiate between draught\nCarlsberg, as said brewed\nand marketed by Watneys,\nand Carlsberg HOF (or \"ex-port\"), also draught, which is\nnot only brewed in the Carlsberg Breweries in Copenhagen but also begged there,\nand exported in this form.\n2) This is in my experience, albeit that this can in\nno way be said to include\nCentral London, retailed in\noutlets, normally free houses,\nroughly comparable in number to Whitbread's Stella\nArtois.\nThe difference between\nthese two brews, apart from\nbeing obvious to anyone who\nhas had the fortune to sample\nthem, is made in the pump-head decoration; the HOF\nvariety having an actual\nmodel of a Copenhagen mermaid sitting on a rock, covered by a canopy, which in\nfact now proclaims the word\nHOF, until a few months ago\nit was \"Export\"; as opposed\nto the Watney's Carlsberg\nwhich just uses a plastic pictorial form of the aforementioned mermaid.\nOtherwise thank you for\nan excellent article.\nYours faithfully,\nRichard G. King,\nMaths I. Exee\nMoiling\nStock?\nSir.\u2014This letter is about\nthe disgraceful way the\nChairman at Thursday'sU. G.M. handled the meeting after the discussion on\nthe Murray Report. In particular he refused to acknowledge the fact that the\nQuorum was being challenged on two separate\noccasions.\nOn the first occasion he\n\"Refused to hear\" the challenge while the Academic\nAffairs Officer, Mr. Doherty, came over to me to\nexplain that the motion had\nto be decided by the next\nday. Following this motion\nI again challenged the\nQuorum by means of a Point of Order. Mr. Black\nthen stated that a challenge\nwas not a point of order, I was shouted down when I tried to rephrase the chal-leng e. As a result of the actions\nof the exec, outlined above\nless than a hundred students have committed the\n4,000 students of I.C. to\nsupporting the students of\nStirling University and mandated our N.U.S. delegates on a grants motion.\nWhether one agrees with\nthe motions is unimportant\nbut what is important is\nthat the exec will conspire\nto prevent a union member\nexercising his constitutional\nright to challenge the Quorum if they want a motion\nto be passed.\n(Mr. Black's objection to\nmy challenge being in a Point of Order is invalid\nsince whether or not the\nmeeting is Quorate DOES\nrelate to the conduct of the\nmeeting and also Standing\nOrder 18(e) states:\n18 With a motion before\nthe meeting the Chairman shall not allow a member to rise ex-ce pt:(e) to challenge\na quorum, which shall\nbe allowed at any\ntime in the meeting\neven on a point of\norder.)\nAny union officer who\ncommits such a blatant infringement of the constitution is not fit to hold office.\nYours sincerely,\nR.F.

    "content": "28th November, 1972\nNEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nFREE! ISSUE No. 320\nNext week\nin\nFELIX\nFull NUS\nCONFERENCE\nREPORT\nCONF\nMOURNS TRAG\nBut the peace\nended there\nMourning the death of\ntwo members of the delegation from Stirling uni-vers it y, who were tragically killed in a car crash\nion the M6 en route to\nMargate, the N.U.S. conference opened on a melancholy note. The, assembled members stood in\nsilence during a moving\nceremony in honour of the\nie ceased delegates, all\ntheir differences buried for\nthe moment as the whole\nbody of the N.U.S. joined\ntheir thoughts, perhaps\nlor the last time this year,\nto contemplate their common loss.\nThe peace ended there.\nThe conference got under\nway, strikingly more\nrowdy and disorganised\nthan last year.\nTHE HOUSING\nMOTION\nNational rents strikes\nwere called for by the delegates who consider that\nin addition the N.U.S. and student unions must\nnegotiate the use of short\nterm council housing for\nstudents. A national rent\nstrike was ordered for\nJanuary with a day of action in February. Surprisingly the conference did\nnot make any demands as\nregards building of new\nhalls but concentrated its\nefforts to increased grants\nto cover the high cost of\nliving, brought about\nlargely by recent substantial rent increases. The\nattention of the conference\nwas drawn to Birmingham\nhall fees, presently half as\nmuch again as at I.C. It is\nclear that government\nmoney cannot be forthcoming in every quarter\nand the conference definitely came down on the\nside of money in our\npockets rather than halls\non our campus.\nREPRESENTATION\nA call for democratic\ncontrol of all Higher Educational establishments by\nstaff, students and local\ncommunity interests. As\nwith all other motions\nthere was a strong emphasis here on trade union involvement in student\naffairs.\nGRANTS\nThe stress in the grants\nmotion lay in the argument that the T.U.C. would not stand for the\nmoney we get and so we\nmust ally with the trade\nunion movement and the\nLabour party in order to\nget grant increases. The\nissue of student weekly\nwages was shelved for the\ntime being as the conference felt that it should not\nbe pressed until the mass\nof students were in favour.\nIt was pleasing to see the\ndelegates accepting, for\nonce, that on this issue\nthey did not enjoy the\nsupport of the student\nbody. The aftermath of\nthis motion, however,\nleaves us in no doubt that\nthe future of N.U.S. is destined to lie with the\nT.U.C. Other motions to be\ndiscussed, at the time of\ngoing to press, are conference reform, student\nnurses and union autonomy. Imperial College students will be relieved to\nhear that their delegates\nare taking a very active\npart in proceedings but\nseem certainly to be following the left wing view\nwhich marks the tone of\nthe whole conference. One\nalmost fears for the survival of the union mandate or I 've lost touch\nwith student feelings.\nSTUDENT PRESS\nThe student press since\narriving at Margate o an only describe their treatment as disgusting. The\nnational press representative, one Francis Bupa,\ncould see no point in\nallowing any press seats\nfor student newspapers as\nhe considered \"the Sun\"\nwas more relevant to students than any student\nnewspaper. (Would you\nbelieve it\u2014Ed.). Consequently he assigned thirty\npress places for thirteen\n\"national\" newspapers (in-clu ding the Margate\nHerald and the Margate Examiner) and\ntried to push all\nthe student press into side\nseats where they couldn't even hear, let alone see,\nwhat was happening. Following a hard fought cam-pa ign, during which much\nbad language was thrown\nabout by our national\npress representative,\n(Francis to his friends, if\nhe's got any) with the aid\nof Leslie Murphy, the student press representative,\nwho perhaps should have\nforeseen the problems, we\nmanaged to get press seats\nand so will be able to\nbring you a full report of\nthe conference in Felix,\nnext week.\nMargate, Sunday.\n\"\nI take a6M wheel'\ninside by chariot\nTHE STACKRIDGE SOUND\nStackridge are a band that always have gone down\nwell on the college circuit, and Saturday night proved\nto be no exception, when they played to a particularly\nresponsive audience. Unfortunately they were without\ntheir beloved \"Crun\", who was in hospital at the time\nhaving his appendix removed, but they managed to\nget a bass player to replace him, although guitarist and\nvocalist James Warren took his place whenever pos-sib le. They started with a good stomping sound, followed\nby \"Tea Time,\" a quieter piece containing a flute solo\nfrom Michael Slater, known to all as \"Mutter\".\n\"Anyone For Tennis\", their new single, sounds delightfully dated, and this, with fiddler Mike Evans'\nsinging, or rather screaming, of the Beatles classic,\n\"Twist and Shout\", showed that they were entertainers as well as musicians.\nSeveral of Stackridge's songs are about fairyland\ncharacters, and from their collection they produced the\nsad story of \"Syracuse the Elephant\", and the tale of\nthe monster \"Slark\", which I thought was spoilt by\n\"Mutter's\" loon ing in the middle.\nThey came back to do a medley of jigs for an\nencore, much to the audience's delight, which \"Mutter\"\nwas hard pushed to keep pace with with his dust-bin\nlid bashing, and they returned yet again to perform\n\"Dora The Female Explorer\".\n\n"

    "content": "November 28, 1972 FELIX Page 3\nThe\nPres.\nDep.\non behalf\nof Himself\n(Mainly)\nI refer to tbe front page of last FELIX, the article\nconcerning Council; such an original topic for FELIX\nto take upon itself to discuss. (Why? Controversial is\nour middle name \u2014 Ed.). It pointed out the shortcomings of the three CCU Academic Affairs Officers, I think it got one or two things confused. Miners have\ndifferent interests to Scientists who have different interests to Engineers. It is almost inevitable that once\nwe get a President (perhaps \"if\") then Mike Doherty\nwill be presenting to Council some ideas on Academic\npolicy. (Mike has some ideas on the subject). Those\nCCU AAO's will be able to give a valuable contrib u tion, giving different and diverse views.\nOf course, you might think that Council shouldn't deal with this type of stuff. Who then? An IC UGM?\nRather unwieldy. Or the proposed 20-member council?\nLook, a38 member council at least provides the POSSIBILITY for opinion from just about every facet of\nthe student opinion. (Except for the extreme a pathis t.I'm sorry a pathis ts, there's not much we can do for\nyou).\nOf course, the article mentioned Floor Reps. It correctly says that they don't represent anyone by them-selves. Tell me, when did anyone speak off-the-cuff on\nsome arbitrary topic and represent anyone but himself.\nIt's about time you learnt that \"representative\" means\n\"Delegation of responsibility without repercussions\"\nunless some specific mandate has been made. But you\nknow as well as I do that a floor rep isn't mandated,\nso what are you getting at?\nFinally, let me pose two guest ions.1. If the \"bureaucratic decisions\" were made by noone in particular, or some small body that could in no\nway realistically reflect the opinions of 4,000 people at\nIC, or even say the 2,000 participating Union members,\nwould you meekly accept them or question them?\ni.e. Is it not better to know that some supposedly\nreflective body, i.e. Council, has tried to make a valued\nappraisal and decision, rather than have the result\nfoisted upon you?\n2. Why, if the article is in favour of a mini council,\ndid Felix attempt last year, with the innovation of a sabbatical editor to press for a place on Council for\nthe Editor (In fact, 1 told Joint Council in May that I did NOT want a place on the Council; it was the idea\nof the Editor at the time.\u2014Ed).\nThe first question is for you to decide, but I think I can partly answer the second.\nMost places on council have come as a result of\npressure at IC UGM's from the people who hold the\nview that Council could benefit from the ideas and\nreflective attitudes of persons holding various posts.\nThe additions came as a result of IC UGM's voting on\nthese propositions. They did NOT come from Council.\nPause.\nThat's the end of my opinion, now on to some fact:\nThe Union\nAs you may have noticed if you've been across there\nlately, things aren't yet ready. The RATT should be\nopening in the near future. Watch this space for further\ndetails. The Bar in the Union Lower Lounge is nearing\ncompletion (I'm not so sure about solidarity with the\nworkers, but more in favour of good solid workers)\n(Eta, ha . . . Ed). There will eventually be a Juke Box\nin the Lounge. Please send me ideas for singles to\nJUKE BOX, c/o TONY BLACKBURN (My real name\nis Paul Jowitt, but don't tell Jimmy Young) IC UNION.\n'1 want to see\nthe SRC change .\n\"I want to see the SRC change\u2014change in quality,\nchange in what we do . . . \"\nSo do I, having been to the emergency SRC (Students'\nRepresentative Council) meeting on the Murray Report\nheld at the University of London Union last Monday.\nThe quote came from Tony Lake, without question the\nmost highly skilled student speaker in the University,\nwho told the meeting that that night was \"the night we\nlose our innocence\".\n\"The end of the divorce of students with the authorities begins tonight\u2014we must become a federal union\nand act federally\", he said.\nLove and kisses,\nPAUL JOWITT\nEd's footnote: Next time, please Paul, read the article\nbefore criticising it. I think, to quote you, \"you got it\nwrong\". Our correspondent is wondering whether it's really necessary to have the Dep Pres on Council . . . .\nBut what does \"acting\nfederally\" mean? Surely\nnot the farce I witnessed\non Monday, when six prepared candidates were returned unopposed onto\nthe Senate Working Party\non the Murray Report.\nThe first part of the\nmeeting was totally pre-dic table. A motion on\nMurray, proposed by the\nExecutive, was eventually\npassed without dissent and\nwithout abstention. The\nmotion welcomed the proposals for the new Senate,\nCourt and Joint Planning\nCommittee, the offer of\nstudent representation on\nUniversity bodies and the\nstrengthening of smaller\ncolleges, but lamented the\ndecision not to offer school\nstatus to Goldsmiths'\nCollege and noted the \"un-satisfactory position\" over\nthe Privy Council policy\nof 'reserved areas'.\nThe debate, which took\nninety minutes, consisted\nin the main of forced\nspeeches on the motion,\nwhich was generally acceptable to everyone pre-sent.\nThe few bones of contention were manifested\nin several amendments,\ntabled variously by St.\nMary's College, Charing\nCross Hospital Medical\nSchool and the Chairman\nof the SRC (Dave Emmett), all of which were\ndefeated.\nBut no amendments\nwere even tabled against\nthe final part of the\nmotion, which welcomed\nthe setting up of the Senate Working Party including six students, and\nresolved the SRC to elect\nat that meeting, \"a representative and expert team\nof students to co-ordinate\nand communicate student\nnews on the Murray Report to the University and,\nwithin the SRC, between\ncollege Unions\".\nSo having passed the\nmotion, the SRC came to\nthe business of elections.\nIt rapidly transpired that\nnot only had the Executive drafted the motion,\nbut had also prepared six\ncandidates for the six\nvacant posts on the Working Party. Stephen Moss,\nExternal Affairs VicePresident of King's College, proposing the can di dates, said that there had\nbeen no other nominations\n. . . hardly surprising,\nsince negligibly few of the\nassembled delegates had\nknown of these nominations (or indeed that there\nA Personal\nViewpoint\nby\nOliver\nDowson\nwere to be nominations at\nall) prior to that after-noon. To some delegates\nthe elections came as a complete surprise. Other\nnominations were not even\nasked for until after Mr.\nMoss had proposed the\nExec's choice, and ploughing confidently onward,\nleaving the other delegates\nspeechless in its wake, the\nExec sewed up their election with no trouble and\ntwo abstentions in just a few minutes.\nOf the Six, some had\nwithout doubt the required mixture of expertise and represent at iv it y: others selected were inevitable as ex-officio candid-at es, and those remaining's merits were dubious.\nTony Lake was the\nSRC's representative on\nthe Murray Committee,\nand with his long experience of the University and\npowers of oration was a natural choice. Jock McEwan was the only member of the Exec chosen\n\u2014he is the Secretary to the\nSRC and a medical student at Middlesex Hospital.\nJoy Clancy, President of\nULU, and Dave Gilles,\nVice-President for Services, are both on the team.\nSteve Moss told the meeting that Miss Clancy\n\"knows more about the\nUniversity than any of\nus\" and was a \"very good\nspeaker\" . . . well, she\ncertainly \"knows what she\nwants\" anyway. Dave\nGilles, who came to the\nmeeting as a representative of the INstitute of\nEducation, was however\nelected to the working\nparty on an NUS platform\n\u2014\"he has the whole nation of students to think\nof\", said Mr. Moss. Dave\nMcVitty, although not\npresent at the meeting,\nwas also elected: he is the\nPresident of Goldsmiths'\nCollege, and, the meeting\nwas told, \"has the interests of small colleges at\nheart\". Paul Goddard,\nPresident of Chelsea College \"stands up on his own\nmerits\" according to Mr.\nMoss, although he did not\nelaborate further than suggesting him to be a good\nspeaker.\nKeith Baker, VioeChairman of the SRC, told\nme that these were not the\nonly people approached:\nseveral others they asked\nwere either unavailable or\nunsuitable.\nIn an LSPA interview\nwith Mary Dunne of\nKings' News, Dave Emmett, the Chairman, said\nthat he considered the\nelections quite fair \u2014 he\nor another member of the\nExecutive had telephoned\nmost delegates present at\nthe meeting during the\nday and informed them of\nthe candidates and election\nprocedure. Few, he said,\nhad expressed any doubts.\nHe correctly stated that\nan opportunity for other\nnominations had been\ngiven.\nBut what sort of an\nopportunity? There's not\nmuch any delegate can do\nwhen he is told what is\nhappening by telephone at\nthree o 'clock in the afternoon with the meeting\nstarting at 7.30. Stuck at\ntheir own colleges, with\nfour-and-a half hours to\nthe meeting, there was\nlittle choice for delegates\nbut to sit back and let it\nall happen.\nOh, I was forgetting.\nAfter the Exec's candidates had been proposed,\nMr. Ernmett offered to\ntake other nominations \u2014\nbut since, in the five-second pause that fol-lowed, no-one shot up and\nsaid anything, nominations\nwere closed.\nAlthough it may be admitted that democracy\ndoes sometimes tend to be\na hindrance, it would be\nnice if the SRC could at\nleast give a semblance of\nit now and again. They\nmight at least have put up,\nsay, ten candidates for the\nsix places so there would\nhave been a choice.\nUnless we get our own\npolitics working fairly,\nhow on earth can we complain about Governments\nand other bodies working\non a national scale.\nsmall\nads\nKEOGH\nCURTAINS:\nLast Thursday night\nfour curtains were removed from Keogh Hall\ngallery.

However, the\ni rst real chance fell to Speedbird, but Boulton saved\ncompetently from a close range blast. The first half\ncame to its end with a goalless score line, in fact, I.C. still had to produce a clear shot at goal.\nThe second half became even more of a procession\nthan the first\u2014it could have been due to one of the opposition walking off for no apparent reason. The goal\nin ally came from a short corner pushed in by Jag jit\nGahir \u2014 undoubtedly the best player on the pitch \u2014\nillegally stopped, but well-hidden, by John Astley and\nfinally cracked into the back of the net by Mick Downs.\nThe miss of the match also fell to Mick Downs who\nmanaged to hit the post of an empty net from only two\nyards out.\nThis week's strop was provided by a certain R. Cam,\noops, Paul Jowitt after only five minutes of achieving\nMs life-long ambition of playing for the l st XI. Praise\nalso for Graham Popple for his continuing improvement at left-back.\nThe 2nd XI received their biggest defeat of the season\u20148-1 from Hayes 2nds. A comment on the match\nwas: \"We were only two or three down with 15 minutes\nto go, but then we got tired from running about our\nown D.\" The 3rd XFs match against Hayes 3rds was a quiet\naffair and did not reach the level of last year's attempted blood-bath. The first quarter of the game consisted\nof almost continuous I.C. pressure which resulted in a goal by Tim Feline after Dave Murch's short corner\nshot had been blocked. Hayes fought their way back\ninto the game, but the score was still 1-0 at half-time.\nAfter an initial burst of I.C. pressure, Hayes controlled\nthe rest of the second half and eventually scored a deserved equalise r when a shot was deflected into his own\nnet by an I.C. defender.\nTeam: Heifer; Parkinson, Murch; Wombell, Lobban,\nCritchley; Brooks, Brewster, Feline, Evans, Fernandes.\nAt the end of this week's report I would like to add\na word of thanks to the members of I.C. who turn out\nfairly regularly as umpires, in particular, Dave Browne\nand John Andrews.\nMIXED HOCKEY\nThe Mixed XI extended their unbeaten run to 13\ngames with a22 draw against City. However, in this\ntest match we were exceedingly lucky not to lose. Mike\nSilverleaf, making his debut in goal, had a devastating\nmatch\u2014he let in both shots he had to save in the first\nhalf. Starting the second half 2-0 down, I.C. began to\nplay some decent hockey and two goals by Jagjit Gahir\nlevelled the scores. However, I.C. slackened off once\nagain and only a dynamic save by Mr. Silverleaf in the\ndying seconds prevented defeat.\nLadies' Hockey\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a rather hairier collection\nof legs than usual were on display at Harlington, as the\n1st XI were entertaining the Analytical Abstracts, an\nall-male team comprised of those stalwarts who work\nan the crumbling depths of the Old Chemistry Building. This team contained all manner Of sportsmen,\nfrom rowers to chess players, but few hockey players,\nso the game, to say the least, was unorthodox. The\nladies' team also contained some unusual faces, notably\nPaul Jowitt, who starred as left inner, and Rosemary\nParker (R.C.S. president), who gave a creditable performance as R.H. Both were press uri sed into playing\nat the last moment.\nThe game was not very fluent for several reasons:\n(a) several of the men appeared to be intent on barging the women off the field; (b) the referee, R. Mounee,\nkept a very close watch on the game (and the R.C.S. president) and blew up for every foul, real or imaginary,\nwhich meant that the game stopped every half minute\nor so; (c) injuries to both sides.\nHowever, the men moved the ball well, with some\ngood attacking play by their captain, C. Little, and\ndefensive work by J. Andrews. M. Walters (L.W.) and\nB. Sharp (L.I.) used their sticks well (both sides of\nthem) having been coached by their wives all week.\nThe men took the lead halfway through the first\nhalf with a goal by B. Sharp, Who scored after trapping the ball nicely with his feet. (The women, waiting\nto be awarded a free hit, were caught off guard). The\nmen's next goal game in the second half, scored by\nJ. Andrews, who pushed the ball into the net after an\nattacking movement starring Chris Little and John\n(ankle-tap per) Bland. A few minutes later the girls\nwere awarded a penalty flick after P. Jowitt was sandwiched between four of the men. Paul scored from this\nto bring the tally to 2-1. This was the final score, though\nspecial commiseration goes to Tom Ryan, who broke\nthrough in the closing seconds to put the ball in the\nnet, but was thwarted by the final whistle going just\nbefore the ball crossed the line.* The game was played\nin good spirit and was enjoyed by all.\n*It was heard later that the referee took an involuntary cold shower after the match.\nTEAMS:\nMen: N. Fouzder, S. das Gupta, J. Kapur, J. Andrews, D. Bevan, j. Moore, C. Little (capt.), M. Walters,\nB. Sharp, T. Ryan, J. Bland.\nWomen: J. Buzzard, M. King, J. Manfield (capt.),\nR. Parker, C. Brown, S. Fairweather, G. Bowden,\nP. Jowitt, L. Beynon, E. Baker, M. Hill.\nfoo i bol On Saturday the 18th of November I.C. played Royal\nHolloway at Harlington. For the first half I.C. played\nlike a bag of spam and against a better side than Royal\nHolloway (and there are few worse) would surely have\nbeen several goals down at half-time. It wasn't only\n\u2022the defence which was letting I.C. down, the midfield\nfailed to mark tightly enough and when they did get\nthe ball through to the forwards there was no one prepared to shoot for goal, instead there was always one\npass too many, allowing R.H. C. to clear their lines. Late\nin the first half Pete Lonnen put in the only respectable\nshot of the half and gave I.C. an undeserved 1-0 lead at\nhalf time. In the second half (after a few words of encouragement from our beloved captain) I.C. played\na little better and the R.H. C. forwards were rendered\nharmless by much tighter marking. Peter Lonnen, who\nwas playing well on the left made it 2-0 when he hit a30 yard lob over the keeper into the far corner of the\nnet. I.C.'s third goal came when a cross from Mick McConvey was headed home by I.C's very own combination of George Best, Martin Chivers, and Rodney\nMarsh (if you want to know who that is, ask Pete Lonnen). The fourth and last goal was a fine header from\nMaurice Hastings. Finally I must say what a great game\nIan Bell had\u2014because he keeps telling me to.\nContinuing their improved form, I.C. II gave a fine\nperformance in beating one of the strongest sides in\ntheir division, Birkbeck II 2-1 in a fast, open and entertaining game, which neither side really deserved to lose.\nBirkbeck pressed hard in the early stages, but I.C., on\nthe few occasions they broke out of defence looked\ndangerous. Birkbeck's skilful forwards were generally\nwell-contained by the I.C. defence, but Martin Clark\nin the I.C. goal was forced to make more than one good\nsave before I.C. began to establish a greater degree of\nmidfield control. Noel Sandler and Alan Peterson in\nmidfield began to win much more possession and I.C. came forward in strength to create several chances. Bob\nDay was chopped down at the ede ge of the box and\nbrought a fine save from the Birkbeck keeper from the\nfree kick. On the half-hour I.C.'s pressure brought its\nreward when Pete Willey, put through by Peterson's pass hit a cross shot w hid h was blocked by a defender's arm. Taking the penalty himself, Willey made no mis-take, and, spurred on by this goal, I.C. increased their\nwork rate and began to control the game. Dave Arise!\nand Derrick Cash were not putting a foot wrong at the\nmiddle of the back and Alan Wilkinson, drafted into\nthe side at late notice was playing as to rmer at left-back. Anything that did get through the defensive\nshield was dealt with brilliantly by Clark in goal.\nThe second half began with strong I.C. pressure;\nDave Green and Noel Sandler were playing much further forward than usual. And things looked black for\nBirk'beck when, after Peterson was fouled at the edge of\nthe box, Day's free kick was headed home by Derrick\nCash. Bill Pike and Pete Willey were combining well up\nfront and I.C. looked set for more goals. But Birkbeck\nshowed their character by running harder to break I.C.'s rhythm in midfield, and the back four came under much\nmore pressure. From one such attack Cash was unlucky to be spotted handling the ball and it seemed that\nBirkbeck were back in the game, but Clark, diving low\nto his left saved the spot kick to crown a great performance. But Birkbeck were coming with more confidence now\nand I.C. were definitely flagging. Twenty minutes from\ntime Birkbeck grabbed the goal they had threatened,\nand from then to the final whistle it was end to end\nstuff, each side making chances from quick breaks out\nof defence. But I.C. managed to hang on to their lead,\nwhich they just about deserved by virtue of Martin\nClark's performance. Birkbeck could claim that they\nwere worth a draw and even unlucky not to win. It was\nthat kind of game.\nAlso on Saturday the 6th team were a little unlucky\nto lose 4-2 to Westfield II.\nOn Wednesday the 22nd the l st XI played King's at Colliers Wood. Having previously beaten King's31 in the cup everyone should have known the strength of\nthis good King's side. However this made no difference\nas most (i.e.10) of the side played as though the opposition was a kindergarten side. Consequently I.C. lost\n4-1. The only player who could even say he had a good\ngame was Gerwyn Edwards who made several good\nsaves especially in the second half, when the midfield\nfolded up completely and left the defence rather ex-posed.\nThe 2nds followed up their fine win over Birkbeck\nwith a41 victory against King's. The 6th s again found themselves a goal down to a King's side\u2014the 3rds this time. Yet again they came\nback strongly in the second half, scoring 4 goals in 12\nminutes and eventually ran out 5-3 winners. But for\nthe forwards atrocious shooting the result could have\ns as i ly been a repeat of last week's result against King's IV. The 6th have now won 4 out of their 5 league\ngames, scoring 25 goals. R. J.K. rowing Surprise ! The first Boat Club news of term !\nFor some unknown reason, the last article never quite\nmade it \u2014 but, never mind \u2014 a last we are in print\nnow, so here goes \u2014\nAfter spending the first five weeks of term in the\nextensive training any ambitious Boat Club needs to\nsucceed nowadays, Saturday, 4th November, saw the\nI.C. Boat Club compete for the first time this season.\nThe event was the \"Fours Head of the River Race\", in\nwhich over two hundred IVs row between Chiswick\nSteps and Putney.\nThe l st VIII was split up for this event into two IVs\n\u2014 one cox ed and one cox less. The cox less IV managed to maintain the good position we achieved last\nyear, which was 33rd overall. The cox ed IV, on the\nother hand, was frankly disappointing. A heavy crew,\nthey finished 96th overall. This poor performance is\nperhaps due to the fact that their coxswain lost a verbal\nbattle with a Leander cox soon after the start. Nothing\nso de moral ising to a crew than such a defeat!\nOur third IV, rowing in the Senior ' C division, provided some amusement near the finish of the race when,\ndue to an unfortunate accident, two members of the\ncrew found themselves rowing a considerably shortened\nstroke. Perhaps they should not blame themselves too\nmuch though \u2022\u2014 the \"blue\" boat in which they were\nrowing, rivals the Queen's Tower in antiquity.\nThe best performance of the afternoon was put up\nby the Novice IV, containing members of our 2nd VIII.\nThey finished third in their division in what was a very\npleasing performance.\nLast weekend, our 2nd VIII competed in the Vesta\nSenior C VIII's race, to defend the 14 pint prize Tankard which we won last year. In a creditable perform-ance, they were beaten by Strafford, the eventual win-ner s. The margin was only half a length, and had our\ncrew been able to lift into top gear for that last vital 30\nseconds, the race might well have been ours. I think\nthat perhaps the reason we did not manage this was a lack of fitness amongst certain crew members. \u2022\nNext week \u2014 read how we did in the L'.L.

Prisons, however even fewer of us will\nbe in the same position as the 150 long term\nconvicts. The authors of this new book have\nchosen to tell the story of the murderer, violent\nrobber, attempted murderer, he t ero sexual and\nhomosexual criminals, the sad plight of those\nisolated and detained in the maximum security\nwing of Durham Prison. These people are there\nto protect society from their actions and\nthought to deter them and others from similar\noffences, to be punished by enforced seclusion\nand deprivation, to be persuaded or forced to\nconform or more simply just to be put out of\ncirculation. In the majority of civilised countries there is no death penalty, banishment or\nphysical torture, consequently locking people\nup is the severest form of punishment. In our\nown particular country there are 40,000 people\nimprisoned . . . the 150 discussed here are\nfor the most cases in for life.\nThe problems confronting these people are\nincreased by the closed emotional world of the\nsecurity wing, the lack of choice of friends and\nthe complete severance of contact with wives\nand girlfriends. All these facts left me with a distinct and very real fear of the consequences\nof breaking the law and a sympathy for those\nthat had and were now suffering. This book\nleft me also with a thought that perhaps organisations such as R.A.P. really deserve very\nclose consideration. In no way did I find the\nauthors social ising or moral ising but I did find\nthe anecdotal style of the book interesting and\neasy to read.\nPerhaps the conclusions one may draw are\nthat getting into a maximum security wing is\ndifficult, getting out is probably only marginally easier, it certainly is not as one Durham\nPrison officer described it, \"It seems they want\nto live like landed gentry. They seem to be\nforgetting completely that they are in prison\nfor punishment.\"\nThe Making of the English Landscape\nby W.G. Hoskins Macmillan and Penguin\nIn a decade which has seen a remarkable proliferation of attention to the environment it is\nperhaps worthwhile to consider a book which avowedly attempts to offer an understanding of its\napparently natural and meaningless make-up. Dr.\nHoskins has written a pioneer work in that he\nattempts to explain the appearance of the whole\ncountry in terms of the successive processes which\nhave acted upon it. In chronological sequence he\nbuilds up today's England, revealing it to be an\nabler and more delicate organism than might be\nsuspected.\nBut this book is not solely for the ecologist. It\noffers an Increased awareness of our surroundings\nby explaining the significance and pattern of their\notherwise haphazard and jumbled features. Written\nin terms comprehensible to the layman it nevertheless encompasses a remarkable scope and depth\nfor so concise a volume. While the skill with which\nit makes a coherent whole of the subject is unrivalled in any other work.\nThe large numbers of photographs and maps are\nan integral part of the text, and the skilled presentation of this material enhances the attractiveness\nof the book enormously. As both hardback and\nPenguin versions are expensively produced in glossy\nformat, at \u00a32.10 and 80p respectively, the offer is\nvery reasonable value.\nWhile generally passive, Dr. Hoskins does present his conclusions in a direct vein. He flays the\n\"England of the arterial bypass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil; England of the bombing range\nwherever there was once silence\". But in a field\nwhere dramatic challenges and platitudes are the\nnorm he has produced an absorbing and scholarly\nwork which Will appeal to those of deeper interest\nthan the search for ready debating ammunition.\nPerhaps the sources of this lasting quality lies in\nDr. Hoskins' concern for the environment regardless of fashionable enthusiasms. With a first publication date of 1955, \"The Making of the English\nLandscape\" predates any bandwagon and will\nprobably still be respected when much of the present effusion on the environment has been mercifully forgotten.\nRaghnall M. Craighead.\nRECORDS It's a Beautiful Day \"At Carnegie Hall\"\n(Columbia \u2014 Import)\nYes readers an imported album, as yet unavailable officially in this country and secured for \"Felix\"\nat great expense? I fear it may also be their last as\nrumour has it that violinist David LaFlamme, the\nmainstay of the group since its inception, has now\nleft.\nI saw It's a Beautiful Day at the Bath Festival in\n1970, when they appeared early on the Saturday\nevening and were well received. However, to my\nendless regret since that occasion, I didn't pay much\nattention as I hadn't heard of them before. Groups\nlike It's a Beautiful Day, with one or two instrumental virtuosos, always go down better live, when\nthe players' ability is given full scope. They haven't returned to England since.\nThe line-up of the group on this record is LaFlamme, Val Fuentes, the grossly underrated drum-mer, and Patti Santos, the singer giving to wearing\nvery short tight hot pants, if the sleeve photograph\nis anything to go by, all of whom survive from the\nfirst album; Fred Webb, who replaced Linda LaFlamme on organ after the first album, and the two\nnewest arrivals, Bill Gregory on guitar and Tom\nFowler on bass.\nThe first track is Taj Mahal's \"Give Your Woman\nWhat She Wants' 'and features some dextrous guitar from Gregory. His playing, though possibly not\ntechnically superior to that of Hal Wagenet, whom\nhe replaced, has a more extrovert style that comes\nover better in a live performance. This is followed\nby \"Hot Summer Day\" from the first album; the\nmelody is, along with Soft Machine's \"Slightly All\nthe Time\", one of the few that really give the impression of general idleness. The lyrics and vocals\nare a bit \"twee\", in fact I could say that about the\nwhole album, as LaFlamme's voice sounds tailor-made for country-and-western music; however,\nthat's a small criticism.\n\"Bombay Calling\" closes Side One and in between the theme that sounds remarkably like Deep\nPurple's \"Child in Time\", are a couple of steaming\nsolos on organ and violin. LaFlamme's piece sounds\nvery oriental ly influenced. The second side opens\nwith \"Going to Another Party\", not noteworthy\napart from some percussive guitar-playing. \"Good\nLovin\" I don't enjoy \u2014 both singers try to sound\nlike soul brother and sister and for me it doesn't come off. This failure is made up for by the last\ntwo numbers, however, \"The Grand Carnel Suite\"\nis my favourite, just long enough for the interest to\nbe maintained and with a square-dance feel to it.\nI wonder if it got the audience on their feet? The\nlast song is \"White Bird\", the group's best known\nnumber, and once noted as LaFlamme's tour-de-force, as anyone who's seen the \"Sounds of the\nSeventies\" film will testify. However, on this version he stays in the background and most of the\nnine minutes is taken up by a gentle guitar solo. A fitting end to the concert.\nIt's a Beautiful Day have never been as popular\nin Britain or the States as some of CBS' other \"pro-gres sive\" bands\" like Santana, for example, but\ntheir following is loyal and enthusiastic. Most of\nthem must have been at this concert, as the applause\nis very loud, possibly dubbed on afterwards. I like\nthis album and it has enough of the facets of popular heavy rock for it to be their most successful\nalbum. Pity that the band aren't together to receive\nthe plaudits.\npw ys When, back in March, I last visited a play at the\nAlmost Free Theatre in Rupert Street (near Piccadilly Circus) the atmosphere was very tense, for\nthe enterprise was very new, and the ground was\nuncertain beneath its feet: artistically and financially. Now the atmosphere has relaxed, and the\nCompany has got well into its stride. The feeling\nthat it could be strangled at any moment by the\nCritics or the Bailiffs, fortunately, has gone.\nThus it is that the new play '11 Josephine's House' by the black actor-playwright Alfred Fagon\ncan be enjoyed easily, without deep soul-searching\nas to the 'validity' or 'point' of the production.\nBasically it is a raucous, and often hilarious, story\nof a group of assorted (very) West Indian im mi grants, including a genial lay about Castan, a struggling Club singer David, a self-righteously sanctimonious deacon (note the small d) George, and his\nhouse-keeping soul-sister Gloria. This mixture produces some pretty riotous behaviour\u2014not at all\nwhat you would expect to find in an English semi\u2014\nand in this lies the 'point' (if any were needed)\nof the production. For while the setting is familiar,\nwith plastic roses, fitted carpets, sherry glasses,\n'tasteful' pictures in frames and an anaemic ally green settee, the inhabitants live a very different\nlife from their white neighbours \u2014 not better or\nworse \u2014 only different. This is the point, that the\n\"Oh, my suffering black brother!\" attitude is as\nmistaken as the \"Why can't they live like us?\"\nangle.\nBut to delve too deep is a mistake here, for, on\nstrict, technical criteria, it is not yet a good play.\nThe first act is quite a bit too long, and dramatic\nclimaxes are reached too often to produce any real\neffect. But the acting (including the playwright him-self) is good, though the single white girl, who\n'shacks-up' with David did seem rather out of her\ndepth. Roland Rees' direction is sound, and has\nused (literally) the energies of the cast to the ut-most, and, in the intimate auditorium with the\naudience on the sides of the stage, an unfamiliar\naspect of life in our Sceptred Isle has been successfully opened-up to the gaze of any who will trouble\nto travel to Rupert Street. The theatre seat is almost\nfree. Bob Carter.\nCLASSICAL HOOT\nFew cities can claim to equal the constantly high musical standard of London.\nThe concert halls here provide a variety of\nmusic guaranteed to satisfy most tastes and\nthe Festival Hall perhaps leads the field.\nCertainly the programme on the evening\nof the 23rd November looked interesting\nand varied. It was a shame that as the London\nPhilharmonic Orchestra took their seats there\nwas still room for more audience, for as it\nturned out the evening was to provide enjoyable performances.\nThe programme started with the Lontano\nfor Full Orchestra by Gyorgy Ligeti. This is\nthe first time that the piece has been performed in London. During its length of about ten\nminutes the music seems designed to generate\nan atmosphere rather than to present a particular line of melody. The LPO under Bernard\nHaitnik their principal conductor responded\nbeautifully and the resulting mood was one of\njourneying through shadowy mists.\nThe change in style between the Ligeti and\nLiszt's Piano Concerto No 2 in A is considerable but the orchestra continued to play excellently this time supporting Alfred Brendel\nas soloist. Liszt's music demands a virtuoso\npianist and Mr. Brendel who has long been\nassociated as an interpreter of Liszt was in\ntop form.\nThe piano concerto in its one movement\nrequires absolute concentration together with\na profound understanding of the contrasting\nmoods by the soloist. At the same time the\nconductor and orchestra must respond which\nthey certainly did.\nThe audience loved it but following the\ninterval there was more of the Brendel/Haitnik\ncombination this time with Liszt's Totentanz\nfor Piano and Orchestra. This is an impressive\nwork on the theme of a Mass for the Dead\nand again requires tremendous dexterity on\nthe part of the soloist. The mood is rather\nsombre but the brilliance of Liszt's music prevents it from becoming gloomy or pointless\nand the whole piece comes to a loud end in\nwhich the whole orchestra and piano join to-get her. Even here Mr. Brendel succeeded in\nmaking himself heard. The loud and warm\napplause which filled the hall showed how\nsuccessful the combination was.\nThe evening ended with Stravinski's Petrushka : Burlesque in Four Scenes. This ballet\nmusic is not as melodious or lyrical as Tchaikovski's and for that reason without the\ndancing to go with it makes great demands\nupon the listener. In spite of the lack of warmth\nthere is a great intellectual quality to the music\nand Mr. Haitnik, with good support from the\norchestra especially among the brass and\nstrings, brought this across.\n\n"
