Bred nowhere in particular( I.e. London) he Is, Intellectually, a Unive\n\u00abr* al Man. An Interest in Chemistry, which showed\nHr elfin eir ly youth, produced a First in due\ncourse, followed by a happy-go-lucky P.G. career,\nwhich gave Mm time to become X.C. Union Secretary.\nXV an undergraduate, he started to play hookey in a desultory fashion, but eventually this gave\nc lace to Gliding as his chief sporting interest.\nHow\u00bb\u00bb*rh* is best Know* tb conn ol s s eure by\nhis Oreen Lady\", an unclothed female figure, who\nhat dominated many I.C. posters in the last two\nyears. She has advertised, with notable suo o ess, Smoking Concerts and Carnivals for R.C.S. It is generally considered that she plays a part in Mr.\nAtkinson s life, similar to that played in Shakesoeare's by the \"dark lady . Reputedly modelled\non a member of I.C. IS.A.( on wh i oh subject there\nhas been an Irrational amount of speculation), an\nanalysis of her, in Freudian terms, leads to some\nstartling coma e ts on her creator's ohara o ter.( c.f. his lamented \"Moral Deform Club\")\nOne suspects that he would be more at hone\non the River Gauche than at I.C. he is deeply\ninterested in painting (though quite incoherent\ninvert al expression of it) and is very mu oh affected by bright colours. It seems particular-ly fortunate that he should be in a responsible\nUnion position this Session, for it is certain\nthat his views on decoration of the New Union\nwill be heard and they may even be followed.\nAs an organizer, Vern is efficient. He was\nChairman of R.C.S. Entertainments Committee last Veer, '-<nd produced the memorable Carnival\" Or gia Romana , the oe leb rated Smoking Concert, and u new venture, the R.C.S. Country House Ball, which\nwa\u00ab outstandingly successful and which will,we hope\nbo repeated. Perhaps his moat successful enterprise ha a been his Ballet in the Carnival Cabaret,\nin which * ' i, Kitchener, prima ballerina, made an\nun fo.\"e tte ble hit descending like Lohengrin fr ott the roof, in the middle of the first act.\nSuch was the flexibility of Mr. Atkinson's prod-uc tion that the audience never realised that Mr,\nKitchener w is not due to appear until the second\nact. This latter virtue of\" flexibility\" is desirable in eon r.ed tid n with. his Gliding activities. Readers of the latest PHOENIX may have noticed that the hei-o of this s creed holds the oo sSt lon of Art Editor11. e. does ail t ne drawings)\nHe has also published a few short stories, which\nour crit lo did not rave over, but which were better than most.\nThe post of Union Secretary Involves this year anur s ner of extra Jobs because of the exp an sion. Mr. Atkinson is responsible for the smooth\ntransition of Union affairs from the Gymnasium\nblock to the Belt Building and is at the moment\nnegotiating with the University for use of the Impe rial Institute for our Social purposes. It is anticipated that he will be successful. In this, and in the many other tasks which\nmake the life of a Union Secretary miserable, we\nwish him all tho suo o eos we a* pe\u00abt from him.\nA.S.

AC. UNION MEE T/ NG\nThe first Union Meeting of the Session\nwas held on Monday, Oat. 11th.in the H.C. S. The President opened the meeting by asking everyone to stand in silence for one min-ute, as a mark of resp eot to the Rector.\nHe then announced, as most of the College\nknew, that Commemoration Day and Commemoration\nBall were o a noel led for this year, but that\nfull mourning for the Union would end that\nnight (the day of the funeral). It was hoped that some kind of Union Ball would be held\nInstead of the Commem. Ball, later in the Session.\nThe main business-of the meeting was taken\nup with a discussion of the arrangements for Nov. 3th. The discussion consisted mostly of\nremarks from the President, who performed his thankless task with remarkable diplomacy and\ntao t. His object was to put over to the Union\nwhy once, again Nov. 5th. must pass un heralded as an occasion for a Rag, at least as;- officially recognised. The reasons were strong;\nfirstly the Union could not expect its elected\nand responsible officers to organise Rags,\nwh i oh should be essentially spontaneous; and\nsecondly, aa a result of last year's events the\nU.L. Senate had Issued an ultimatum to all London students and had asked for the co-operation\nof U.L. U. The ultimatum was to the effect that any student in trouble with the Authorities on November 5th. would be sent down. The Union\nacknowledged these reasons and was then asked\nto .consider what I.C. would do instead of a Rao\non Nov. 5th. The President indicated that the\nreason for the date of the present meeting\nwas that the Union would thus have plenty of\ntime to o on s lder what waa to be done. Little arose from the floor on this matter so that\nmost probably, aa usual, I.C. will officially be at Harlington for Guy Fawkes Day.\nOther business waa the election of Basil Evana and Also Fraser to the Entertainments\nCommittee, and the selection of 'Hags' Slater\ns s an 'ERE, the custodian of Herbert's key.\nThe attendance at the meeting was about 250,\nwh i oh was small considering the importance of\nthe agenda. This is where the loss of the Gym\nbe oom ea most marked, since there is now no o entr al meeting-pla oe. Possibly also Guildsmen and\nMiners are loth to go into the R.C.S.| The tone of the meeting was very subdued,\none almost might say tame for a Union meeting,\nremembering the informality and blunt speaking\nin the Gym. It is to be hoped that the Union\nwill keep the temper of its Meetings up to the\nold lively level, wh i oh does not mean, the wholesale slinging of fireworks, but does mean part ici pati on, both in wit and in plain speaking,\nfrom the floor as well as from the Chair.\nRIGHT LADS - ON THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER\nREMEMBER IF THEM THERE STUDENTS IS\nSTANDING STILL, IT'S LOITERING WITH INTENT4 AND IF THEY BE MOVING , IT'S FORMING A PROCESS lOM) *\n\n"

Several months previously, noticing a loose wooden block in the floor, he had lifted it, found nothing there except some floor sweepings, and had left a note commemorating his Inspection. When a. new Professor took the room over, a few days ago, he noticed the wooden block, and\nasked his students what it was for. They did not know, and cms of the\u2122 lifted it for him. He, and\nh\\sP r off is j or( who was watching, with interest) were surprised t of in cf staring up at them our friend's note, Inscribed \"NOS^YB\". \u2022\nThe reaction of the Professor was most\ncreditable, and Illustrates vividly the Idea l^e lAch my nt of the succes:ful ac inti st! he moved\nnot K muscle, not- raised an eyebrow a millimetre. He ft sker f his. student to replace the block, with tbe note underneath. HOW DO YOU EAT?\nJudging by the state of the Refectory queues during the first days of term, eating lunch tn is session is going to be an even more\nlen gui y operation than before./ iLl X proposes to conduct a survey into the use made of the Ref eo tory, the Snack Bar, and Que nie' s at lunchtimes. Ah attempt will also be made to find the proportion of students eating in the college and outside. A survey conducted last year on queues in tue evening yielded some useful information, but the time factor is usually far more important at lunch than it is in tue evening. The crowd at, lunch is of an altogether different order, and the two studies are entirely separate. If you are interested in the collection and interpretation of tries e figures, please drop a line to the Editor. LIMERICK\nThere was a young man called a fresher', Vno nay or may not have some leisure If he has a Brown Bag Then his spirits will flag From t ne moment he starts being a fresher. ODD BOD S It is often confusing for the fresher, newly arrived a tI.e., to recognise and\ndistinguish between the various breeds of\nstaff which haunt the precincts. It is hoped that these notes may be of some help to the naive. Starting from the top and working down-wards: -Dean. Ihe novice may confuse\nthis species with the Professors mentioned ;\nbelow, and students have been known to leave I.C. still under the Impression that a Dean\nwas a hole in the ground. Suffice it to say\nthat a Dean is always a Professor but a Professor is not always a Dean, \u2022\n(To make the matter more difficult Deans alter from time to time and so it is a case of Dean one day and gone the next.)\nProfessor. The greatest difficulty is often experienced by fresher s in identifying a Professor, and in fact they oo mein all shapes and sizes, the only oom mon feature being that they are\nnot often seen. As a solemn warning to the\nnewcomer, if you see a portly figure dressed in overalls and carrying a bucket and a broom,\nbe careful, it may be t ne Professor! Be fri enc ly to your Professor, wish him good morning to put him a this ease, congratulate him on the\nefficiency of his department ( if he shows\nfaint surprise at this it is because he is' so\nused to talc ing the efficiency of the department\nfor granted that the idea may be a little strange), then ask him how the kids are and\nhow the research is going. A few friendly remarks like these have made a big differ eno e to the careers of many a student.\nLecturer. Most abundant in the early morning, con-cent ration decreasing exponentially with time\nafter3 p.m. Recognised by grey suit, white\ncollar and general air of having nothing to do. Will answer questions if cornered but\nthis may prove dangerous if persisted in. Junior Lecturers. An interesting study of a young man gone\nwrong; paradoxically they have mu oh less to\ndo than a leo ture r. Since all possess an\nair of having the world on their shoulders, this may be due to the low salary or to\nsecret vice. Demonstrators.\nA research student who has sold his soul for lucre. Can be found prowling around\nlaboratories, identified by the fact that they\nare the only people not actually doing anything!\nThey have a general spirit of non-cooperation\nand enjoy exercising a peculiar brand of sarcastic wit which is handed down from gene ration to generation. Can be disconcerted by an apparently guileless demand for the\ncorrect result. Laboratory Stewards.\nOften mistaken for Professors and vio ever s a. Research Students.\nAgain not strictly staff but sometimes\nconfused with the latter by the newcomer.\nEasily recognised and often seen in the\ncorridors, badly dressed and carrying things) this is because they work on the pri no ip le\"if you see something lying about, pick it up,\nit may oo mein useful\". They live in rooms\no rammed to the ceiling with bits and pieces gathered according to this dictum. The same\ncreed serves them in good stead at the Hops,\nwhich explains why shorthand typists are so\nrarely met on Saturday nights. Many research students have a marked\na version to working between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., a neurosis conditioned by their undergraduate\ndays. They have a strange little blue god\nof their own which they call \"The Thesis\" and\nto wh i oh they make as a or if ioe of their results. Those who have no results can often be found\n.sobbing in dark corners because their little blue god is angry.\nT.W. "

Although he had not been\nwell for some time, hie death o a me as a great\nshook to all his friends. Sir. Hoderio o a me as Heotor to I.e. in1948 in\" succession to Sir Hiohard Southwell, bring ing to the task all the experience, energy and\ndrive of his long and distinguished career in the teo i mio al branches of the R.A.J?. Exceptionally gifted in many directions, as\nan artist whose work will be remembered by all who visited the exhibition of drawings and\npaintings at the College last year; as an au-thor; and as- an engineer at Farnborough in the\nearly days of u. it was as an administrator that the Rector excelled. Having a strong academic background as the\nson of Prof. M.H ill,E.R.3. and a graduate of University College, t ne Rector had firm views on\nthe purpose of a University life. He believed that Uie college was not merely a collection of lecture rooms and laboratories, hut aol ubin the broadest sense where the student developed\nu is character by meeting people and making las ting friends and Impressions.\nHe realised tu at one essential to this ideal was a ii app y staff student relationship, he fostered Dinner in hall as a function at which staff and students could meet on Informal\nand equal ter:as\u00bb Today that function is a very\nreal part of College life. There as at all soci a la at ii e rings lad^ n ill and Sir Roderio were\nthe perfect notts. taking av. ur;n and lively interest in all ti.e ir0u est s.

SEELEY Circulation:1200 It was with surprise and profound\nshook that the College learned last week of\nthe death of the Rector, Sir Roderic Hill. On Wednesday, Oot. 7th. Sir Roderio had lun ched in the City and was walking along Great\nTrinity Lane when he collapsed. The Union extends its deep sympathy\nto the bereaved family, Lady Hill,, 'Sfudenoe\nand Phoebe Ann, who many of us know so well. Sir Roderic was an Air Chief Marshal,\na wartime chief of Fighter Command, and the\nman responsible for the defeat of Hitler' s Flying Bombs. A man of his accomplishments\npossesses many facets seen by the public eye,\nand these were reflected by the obituaries printed in the \"Times\", \"Daily Telegraph\",\n\"Manchester Guardian\", and other daily news-papers. The \"Times\" cutting has been pin ned on the General Studies Board in the Union\nEntrance Hall, where everyone o an read it.

But mobil ising our second\nbest quill, we are going to tell you (In response\nto your many enquiries) about our personal tar.te\nin men. We consulted our list of eligible bach el ors(nylon shirts and ter yle ne socks essential) and what we found there set us thinking. This la what we thought.\nWhy is it that R.C.S. has such a monopoly\nof weedy brown bag gers, lacking In charm and cul ture?\nWhy is it that Gulldsmen, though usually\npleasant, charming and courteous, are often\nrather dull? Why are the Miners so much better thun the\nrest? Miners are the sort of men a girl ll k^oto meet; Engineers are the sort of men a girl'\", mother likes to meet; but who in h?r se:ese wants to\nmeet the I.C. brand of scientist? Cassandra,\nR.C.S. men who feel exceptional should transfer to\nMines immediately.\nIt is not un of fi ol ally denied that the\nI.C. w.S.C. pot will be in use this ft eos 'tim. No\ndetails are: unknown.\n\n"
