Left, far left, ultra left and falling off\nthe edge.\nThe conference opening was fairly lively\u2014\nmainly due to the fact that the introduction\nwas given by the President of Liverpool\nUniversity. \"So what?\" you might say. Well,\nall is revealed when I tell you 'that he was\na Tory (capital t intended).\nThe majority of the conference was taken\nup with a mixture of Executive report and\nthe main motions (reported on separately\non this page and elsewhere). As ait IC, when\nsomeone stood to make a point of order it\nwas inevitably used to try and make a speech\nfor or against the item under discussion.\nThis inevitably wasted considerable amounts\nof time as did the time spent asking the\ndelegates to be quiet. The impression was\nthat most delegates were wasting the money\nspent by their constituent unions as they\nweren't even listening to the debates. Instead they preferred (\nto try and ensure that\nno one else could hear.\nThere were several \"in sections\" that most\npeople managed to twist into their speeches\none way or another. The most noticeable\nwas the FE and small colleges. These are\napparently a section that have got little\nattention within the national union in i the past but it apep a red that they were trying\nto make up for at least 1\n0 years. Minorities\nwere also heavily supported.\nThe Federation of Conservative Students\nwere also there in force and they came in\nfor quite a bashing throughout. They also\nproduced ahu mph sheet which you either\nignored, laughed at or complained about\ndepending on your colour, sorry shade\n(mainly in varying degrees of redness) of\npolitics. Their series of seven were, however,\nonly a drop in what must have been an\nenormous drain on the country's paper\nstocks. Another interesting point about the\nFCS was that they were selling Tribune'\non their Stall in the entrance way outside\nthe hall. The person who said that student\npolitics are complicated knew what he was\ntalking about\nThroughout conference there were several\nsubsidiary meetings for different groups.\nBroad left, women, entertainments, student\ndrama, etc., etc. There were also Compositing Meetings. For those who don't know\na brief explanation may be necessary. Before conference numerous colleges submit\nmotions that they would like to see discussed at conference. These are then circulated and the colleges prior it is e several for\ndiscussion at conference (the top five are\nnormally discussed). At conference, all the\nUnions that have submitted motions on a prior it is ed topic get together to try and find\npoints of common understanding between\ntheir own views on the same topic. After a lot of hard bargaining and !\n9\nome give and\ntake from the people concerned they finally\narrive at one complete motion (normally\nfairly large) with several smaller amendments which represent views that are not\nheld by the majority of those submitting\nmotions. This motion and amendments is\nthen debated on the conference floor.\nConference also suffered from 'celebrities'\nlike one person who always seemed to find\nit hard to sit down and was invariably blocking up the gangways during both debates\nand more especially votes when no one is\nsupposed to be standing.\nI can think of only one redeeming factor\nof conference. That is that 'luckily there is\na comedian on the NUS executive (Colin\nBurke, Executive member and former president Of Bangor). He is to 'retire' soon but\nhis replacement is nearly as funny (and\nalso president of Bangor). Conference was\nworth it if only for the closing speech given\njointly by these two.\nP.A. Wadsworth\nRACIALISM & OVERSEAS\nSTUDENTS\nThis proved to be a major\nissue in Conference, provoking a heated debate, and a( largely unwarranted) storm\nof controversy in the Press.\nOriginally it was not down on\nthe order paper; however,\nfollowing a short procedural\ndebate, the motions on Racialism and Overseas Students\nwere combined, and were\nthus discussed in place of the\nHousing motion.\nHence. what eventually\ncame to the floor of Conference, after i the compositing sessions, which tended to\nbe a bit hairy, because of the\ndifficulty of combining two\nmotions, was a resolution\nbasically concerned with\nracial is m and its manifestations. Four main issues for\na national campaign were\nidentified:\na. overseas students\nb. education\nc. discriminatory legislation\nd. the growth of fascist or-gan is at ions. It is generally recognised\nthat overseas students face\ndiscrimination in having to\npay \u00a3254 in tuition fees as\nagainst \u00a387 for \"home\" stu-dents; in being forced to pay\nup to \u00a320 in LEA hostels, as\nwell as VAT; in terms of a \"quota\" system in many col-leg es; and in terms of discrimination by landlords, accommodation bureaux and\nemployment bureaux.\nConference called for a campaign against this discrimination and in addition,\nrejected the suggestions by\nthe- Commons Expenditure\nCommittee that fees for overseas postgraduates be raised\nto \u00a31,300. This is an issue\nparticularly pertinent to IC\nwhere some 40-50 per cent of\npost grads are from overseas.\nConference condemned\n\"the racial is m existing in the\neducation system\". This is\nreflected in the many books\nused by schools (\"Little Black\nSambo\", \"Biggies\", etc.), the\nhigh number of non-white\nchildren in schools for the\n''educationally sub-normal'',\nand the recent \"theories\" of\ninequality between races,\npropagated by so-called scientists, eg. Eysenc, Jensen and\nShockley.\nConference called for a refutation of these ideas and\nfor the introduction of black-studies courses into schools,\neso as I to combat th conception that 3rd world people\nhave no history, culture or\nachievements.\nThirdly, Conference rejected the 1971 ImnYigation Act\nas racist and discriminatory.\nNoting that most of its provisions did not apply to Europeans, delegates rejected the\nview that racism stems from\nthe presence of black people\nin Britain.\nComplaints against the Police and racist activity were\nlargely ignored by the Government, and the machinery\nof Race Relations remains\nlargely ineffective. Thus\nwhilst massive publicity is\ngiven to racist speeches, e.g. Powell's diatribes, the replies\nby anti-racist groups go\nlargely unheard. ,\nFinally the bit that you all\nheard about. This was an\namendment which fell into\ntwo parts. Thefirstcalled on\nUnions not to grant financial\nor material assistance to\nopenly racist or fascist organisations (e.g. National Front\nor Monday Club\u2014not the\nConservative Party) and to\ndeny them a platform.\nMany people became steamed up about the right to free\nspeech. However the professed raison d'e tre of the named organisations is to get\nrid of people that they dislike because of (their colour,\nand if this is not immediately\npossible, 'to i brutal is e them\nin such a way that they will\neventually go away. This in\nitself is a fundamental denial\nof a man's right to exist.\nHence, it would seem correct that the apostles of racial hatred should not be invited onto College premises\nbecause they are preaching a denial of freedom to the few\nby the many, and thus forfeit their \"right\" to free\nspeech.\nThe argument that it is possible to debate with fascists\nis quite spurious. On the one\nhand, it is insufferable arr or ance to pretend that a student might out-argue Enoch\nPowell, no matter how clear\nthe rights and wrongs before-hand. On the other hand, we\nhave the experience of Jews\nin Nazi-occupied territories\nas a precedent of \"reasoned\ndebate\" with fascists.\nHence the essential issue is\nwhether to invite racists to\nColleges or hot. I do not see\nthe issue as being in grave\ndoubt; I believe that students\nparticularly the overseas Stuents, will reject the concept\nof having fascists on campus.\nIn this case, the issue of\nwhat to do if these people\ndo get on to campuses is\nof very little importance.\nBesides, the idea of basing\na campaign on us waiting\nfor fascists to hold a meeting so that we can disrupt it\nanyway is quite ludicrous.\nFinally the point is that,\nparticularly, in terms of the\ncampaign on overseas t lud ents, we now have a national\ninitiative to go ahead with.\nI expect to see some action\non this front very shortly;\nsupport the campaign.\nT. Phillips\nPOSTGRADUATES\nCONFERENCE EXECUTIVE REPORT\nNUS executive prepare and take a report\nshowing exactly what use the resources of\nNUS have been put to since the last report.\nThey must show, especially, what they have\ndone on specific mandates from Conference.\nAs the Executive is composed mainly of\nnon-sabbatical officers, who are not able to\ndo all that conference expects of them, there\nare, usually,fireworks as a particular mem-ber's incompetence in one section (often due\nto spending too much time on something\nelse) is ruthlessly exposed on the conference floor. Written questions to the report\nare tabled in advance of conference and\nan answer is supplied at conference. If this\nanswer is not satisfactory a verbal supplementary question can be asked by the constituent organisation during the time that\nsection of the report is before conference.\nIf the reply is still unsatisfactory the constituent organisation can move any of the\nfollowing procedural motions:\n1. Reference Back of the report.\n2. Rejection of an executive opinion.\n3. Instruction to do what they were mandated to do.\n4. Continuation as not enough has been\ndone yet.\n5. Censure on a member of the executive.\n6. Removal of a spec fic responsibility from\na member.\nThe report was split into sections of\nMeetings, Adult Education, Assessment,\nCareers advice and counselling, Casework,\nEnts, Gay Rights, Grants, Health Students,\nHousing, Lecturer Training Part Time and\nIndustrial Students, Postgraduates, Representation, Specialist Groups, Sport, Student\nHealth, White Paper, Women, Art 'Colleges,\nCollege of Education, Technical Colleges\nand Polytechnics, Universities in the Education and Welfare section, Legal Advice and\nAid, Regions and Areas, Disputes, Student\nCommunity Action, International and Miscellaneous, Overseas Students, Race Relations/\nRacism, NUSS, Conservation and Trade\nUnions.\nOf special interest to I.C. students might\nbe:\nEnts: NUS's clown Burke still thinks\nbrokerage is feasible someday (5-10 years\nin answer to a supplementary question).\nGay Rights: Al Stewart has responsibility\nstill.\nPostgraduates: dominated by NUS/ASTMS\nclash over negotiating rights.\nWhite Paper: Like I.C., NUS has done\nvery little. NUS had a mandate to run a campaign on a similar (Standing to Grants.\nExec blatantly ignored this. Stuart Paul wa3 censured and the report referred back.\nWomen: A very militant lot. You dont\nargue with Judy Cotter!! Best (in fact only)\nthing they could do is to try to organise\ntrouble at the anti-abortion rally in London,\non 28th April. A rather sterile lot.\nEssex was presented at conference at the\nstart of the revolution. Great glee wheal\nStuart Paul (Broad Left candidate for Presf*\ndent) was quoted as saying that it was all\njust an IMG stunt. Conference generally to\nsympathy.\nSunday Times National Student Drama\nFestival: Exec was against having anything\nto do with this. A strong drama lobby re*\nfer red back the report with a great deal of\nhelp from Al Stewart who had been landed k with a bad policy from his predecessor^\nA one-day conference on drama is to be\norganised and this will resolve the matter.\nSoviet Dissidents: This is rapidly becoming\nsilly. Both at Margate and Liverpool, Exec\nhave tried a Whitewash. This time John\nCushnlhan\u2014I will defend Russia as the best\nstate\u2014presented a report. This was really a treatise on newspaper subjectivity. I.C. cult\nthrough the waffle with its only question:\n\"Does Exec deny that the weight of evidence is that there are massive numbers\nof genuine dissidents in the Soviet Union \"a John Cushnihan replied that he did not\ndeny that there were substantial numbers\nand he had no doubt about this.\nThe report was so bad it was referred\nback.\nAll the deg elates should have copies of\nthe report and you 'should be able to see\none if you come into I.C. Union office and\ngrab one of the I.C. Exec. I shall be available\nto give further details when we report to\nCouncil.\nD. SINCLAffi\nDeputy President,\nELECTIONS\nAs far as I am sure many of you are\nconcerned, the only important and doubtful\nresult was in the election of President.\nThere were five challengers:\nBeeson\u2014Young Socialist (I don't know\nwhat to do now the Tories have resigned\").\nHill\u2014International Socialist (Wears dark\nglasses to shield himself from the realities\nof i the world).\nMcGowan\u2014International Marxist group\n(very difficult to understand, but his ideas\nt vere similar to those of the ultra-left).\nPaul\u2014Broad left (Scottish, beer gut, this\nyear'sD.P. quoted to be the \"Executive\ndoll of the Broad Left movement\").\nRandall\u2014This year's president (No particular political affiliation other than Left\u2014\nmost frequently used adjective, verb, pronoun . . . is F.E's.( Further Education col-leg es) due I to the great deal of support he\nhas gained from this sector over the past\n1\n2 months).\nThe only real contenders for the post\nwere Paul and Randall, who have been bitching at each other since last November when\nMr. Paul and his Broad Left friends decided\nthat Mr. Randall's lead in the Grants campaign was lacking in incentive and new\nideas, or rather, his support for what was\nhappening was non-existent.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Paul did not realise\nthat whilst he was spending so much time\ncriticising Mr. Randall, he was not in fact\ncarrying out a mandate laid on him by Margate conference, i.e. to develop a campaign\naround the White Paper on the content of\nhigher education, which was supposed to\nbe given equal priority to the Grants cam-pa ign'! This bitching had gone on for some\ntime, and had lost support for both can di dates, consequently, when the votes were\ncounted it was very close, there only being\n21 votes between these two candidates in\nthe final analysis:\n3rd1 st1 st2 nd count reallocation\nBeeson 1\n0\nHill 1\n0\n5 106 1\n3\n1\nMcGowan 25 28\nPaul 281 285 287\nRandall 263 265 266\nThe motion on postgraduates prior it is ed at the Universities Specialist Conference\nformed the main part of the substantive motion. Sections on overseas postgraduates\nand the expenditure committee's report were also included. The only contentious issue\nwas whether or not the NiUS should have sole negotiating rights as far as tutoring and\ndemonstrating rates are concerned. There were two amendments on this\u2014one stating\nthat (Postgraduates should join (the relevant trade union. Which would then negotiate\non their behaK and the other giving sole negotiating rights to the NUS. Both were de-feat ed.A fuller report on the postgraduate debate appears on page 4.\n314\n335\nMy only comment is that I saw Randall\nout walking with his wife and young child\nshortly afterwards, and he looked like a man who realised that a majority of 21 out\nof 649 votes was not what could be called\na clear indication that the NUS conference\nwanted him to be their President.\nThere is however one consolation, he cannot make a worse job of it next year than\nhe has this year.\nThe second election was a clear cut affair,\nand the obvious candidate deserved to get!\nelected, this was Al Stewart. He has had\nresponsibility for the Gay movement in\nNUS this year, and as such has done an\nexcellent job. The other candidates were\nWaller (Far Left idiot), Robinson (inexpert*\nen ced member of ConSoc), Martin (obsessed\nwith occupations and militancy).\nThe voting was as follows:\nWaller 1\n4\n8\nStewart 430\nRobinson 1\n0\n7\nMartin ill\nThe third election was for a National\nSecretary. Starring in this episode was the\nfamous Steve (Basher) Parry, this year's National Secretary, who has been accused\nof everything from bringing children into\nthe world, to removing them from it. lit\nwas obvious from the start of the hustings\nthe other candidates had merely been put\nup to get at Parry, but my impression wa\u00bb\nthat he was the obvious candidate. The\nvoting was as follows:\n1st1 st2 nd3r* count reallocation\nBurke 206 208 219 300\nFitzpatrick 9\nLukes 36 38\nParry 326 329 330 352\nPov;y105106130 The fourth sabbatical election was for\nNational Treasurer. The only real candidate\nfor this was Charles Clarke. The voting was\nas follows:\nClarke 362\nFitzpatrick 173\nRobinson 9\n4\nWillshire 8\nThe remainder of the elections on to\nthe NUS executive were not quite so heated,\nand a list of successful candidates follows:\nVicej\nPresidents\u2014Services, Robertson; Eduj\ncation, Slipman; Regions, Bailey; without\nPortfolio, Carr.\nExecutive Officers\u2014Gates, De Graaf, Webster.\nExecutive Committee Officers\u2014Elliot,\nMale, Povey.\nNext year's executive is mainly allied tX> the Broad Left political faction, which can\nprobably be classed as the least extreme,\nmost sensible grouping which there is at\npresent. Those few members of the executive\nnot in this group should in general remain\nunobtrusive with (hopefully) the one exception of John Randall. Bt will i be interest\ning to see over the next 1\n2 months if Wie\nexecutive achieves as much as it is capable\nof doing.\nNORM\nGRANTS ON PAGE 6\n\n"

This\nlatest album of theirs was recorded live\nat Central Park, NYC, last August.\nShaNaNa specialise in rock'n 'roll in the\nlate '50s style. They are excellent when\ndoing remakes of the originals but their\nown material tends to be sadly lacking.\nThis live album also contains the stage\npatter that they included in the holding\nof a dance contest. It doesn't work and\nonly helps to spoil the continuity of the\nalbum.\nThe Dubliners\u2014Live\nOne for the folk freaks amongst you.\nAlso a live recording but this one is in\nthe more humbler surroundings of the\nShakespeare Theatre Club in Liverpool.\nIncluded on this album are, of course,\n\"Seven Drunken Nights\", \"Dirty Old\nTown\", \"Whiskey in a Jar\", and \"Black\nVelvet Band\". Also captured is some of\ntheir stage patter that adds so much to\ntheir live performances. Highly recommended for folk lovers.\nRoy Buchanan\u2014That's What IAm Here For\nAs many of you will no doubt know\nRoy has emerged in the last 18 months\nas a guitarist good enough to rival (and\nbeat) the best. This album has all his\nhallmarks. Flowing riffs, extended instrumental sections (although there is\nonly one purely instrumental track), and\nbad vocals. Roy only sings on one track\nbut I found Billy Price's vocals rather\nharsh. Roy is an excellent guitarist and\nit really shows on the track \"Hey Joe\",\nhis dedication to Jimi Hendrix and a number that always goes down well at\nhis concerts. 1 like it and would recommend it but then I'm biased.\nReturn to Forever\u2014Hymn of the\nSeventh Galaxy\nReturn to Forever are probably better\nknown for one of their members, Chick\nCorea, who plays mainly electric and\nacoustic pianos. This would probably be\ndescribed as modern jazz, though I admit\nthat I wouldn't know. They have just\ncompleted their first British tour and\nhave apparently been drawing in the\npeople. I couldn't say that this record\nwould convert me into being a lover of\nthis kind of music, but I 've no doubt\nthat someone, somewhere, likes it.\nThe Doobie Brothers\u2014What Were Once\nVices Are Now Habits\nThis, along with the next reviewed\nalbum, are the pick of what is a fairly\ngood bunch of records. The Doobies\nhave been recently making a strong impact on the British scene and I have\nbeen eagerly looking forward to hearing\na record of theirs. It is very easy going\nwith plenty of soft, gentle guitar picking\nwell augmented with pedal steel guitar.\nThis combines with excellent vocal harmonies to produce what I would call a pleasant album. That word, however,\ndoesn't go anywhere near to fully describing it. I really enjoyed this album\nand would recommend it highly.\nSeals and Crofts\u2014l.n born Child\nAs mentioned above this is also an\nexcellent album. Very much in the style\nof Crosby, Stills and Nash but with\nrather more production work in the use\nof horn and string arrangements for the\nbackings. The numbers are mainly joint\nworks between Messrs. Seals and Crofts\nand they are put over very well by them\nand the rest of the band. Very much\nagain a record to be highly re com mended.\nHenry Gross\u2014Henry Gross\nHenry Gross is a relative unknown in\nBritain, though he has a fair reputation\nin America. He worked with ShaNaNa\nfor 18 months and then 'retired' from\nthe scene. After this retirement he invited\nsome friends along to a studio and the\nrecordings that were produced are this\nalbum. A very competent album but\nit is unlikely that he will be able\nto break into the commercially mind c market that exists in the record industry.\nHe has written most of the songs him-self, but he gives an excellent rendition\nof the Lindisfarne hit 'Meet Me On The\nCorner'. Well worth a listen to, if you\ncan find one to listen to.\nNUS Conference (cont'd.) GRANTS MOTION\nThe production of the motion on\ngrants at Liverpool was, as usual, a long and arduous process. Because of\nthe necessity to bring the submitted\nmotions up to date following the\nGeneral Election, emergency amendments were allowed- to be submitted on\nthe first day of conference. After many\nhours spent in compositing sessions conference was presented with a document\ncontaining the main motion and seventeen amendments to be debated. All the amendments from IC concerning\nopposition to national rent strikes,\nopposition to loan-financing of post-graduates, and support for equal\ngrants and fees for British and overseas students were composite d into the\nmain motion.\n' :\nThe debate took about six hours on\nthe evening of the fourth day of conference and it is to the great credit of\nt jie delegates and observers that very\nfew submitted to the temptation of the\nbars for more than a few minutes during the whole time of the debate. The\ncomplexity of the motion finally passed\ncan be gauged by the facts that there\nwere 56 points under 'conference notes',\n20 under 'policy', 19 under 'campaign\nphilosophy', 11 under 'tactics' and 32\ninstructions to NUS executive, Constituent Organisations and areas.\nObviously with so many points a lot\nof the motion went un debated, the\namendments cent ring around a few of\nthe more contentious. One of these was\nthe proposal to or agni sea national\ndemonstration in London between\nMay 7 and mid-May to call on the\nGovernment to meet the full grants\nclaim and end all victim is at ions, this\ndemonstration to go to Labour Party\nHQ. NUS Exec, opposed this on the\ngrounds of #he difficulty pf organising\nsuch a demo in the summer term and\nproposed a delegate rally instead,\n\"The Sting\"\nDirector George Roy Hill, with Paul\nNewman and Robert Redford at local\nABC's and Universal, Regent Street.\n\"Zardoz\"\nDirector John Boorman, with .Sean Connery.\nOdeon, Leicester Square.\n\"Serpico\"\nDirector Sidney Lumet, with Al Pacino.\nParamount, Regent Street.\nI went to \"The Sting\" because I couldn't get into Russell's \"Mahler\". I still haven't seen \"Mahler\", but I have\nseen the best film produced since \"The\nGodfather\".\n\"The Sting\" is the story of two con-men who set out to pull the Big One\nthat every con-man dreamt of. It is set\nin Chicago, during the Depression. The\nplot unfolds so beautifully it would be a disservice to the film to reveal it any\nfurther. The team of Newman and Redford (Butch Cassidy) comes together\nagain, but the real praise must go to the\ndirector, George Roy Hill. The film\nflows easily, and subtly, with the camera\npicking up an occasional glimpse of the\nruin of the American depression: the sets\nare accurate and convincing, like the\ncostumes, without being overdone, as in\n\"Gatsby\".\nPaul Newman is better than I 've ever\nseen him: he plays the con-artist Gondorff, with ease and subtlety. Redford is\na fine foil for him (even if he does underact a little); Eileen Brennan turns in another gem of a supporting role (I can't think why she hasn't yet had an Oscar).\nHowever, all the actors benefit by Hill's excellent handling and David Ward's script.\n\"The Sting\" took seven Oscars. It\ndeserved every one, and more. See it\nearly, as you'll want to see it twice.\nJohn Boorman's \"Zardoz\" is not on a par with his last film, Deliverance. However, anyone who can get Sean Connery\nto prance around for the best part of an\nhour in a red loincloth and crossed bandoliers earns my respect. Connery plays\nan enigmatic and primitive intruder into\na \"technological commune\" in 2293,\nwhere the inhabitants are sealed off from\nthe barbaric outside world. They live\nmonotonously satisfying lives, and have\ndiscovered the secret of eternal life\n(hence the need for sexual desire has\ndisappeared. Sorry, lads). The \"brutal\"\nConnery, by penetrating the Camelot\nupsets the balance of the perfect community and precipitates a cataclysmic\nclimax to the film, at which point several\nquestions are resolved.\nScience fiction fans will love it, despite\nthe two or three totally ludicrous seq-u en ces. For instance, in a sort of psychedelic tutorial Connery absorbs \"all there\nis to be know ed\"; Boorman attempts to\nindicate this by flashing bits of complicated formulae across the screen with a background of Beethoven and snatches\nof Shakespeare and Eliot. It doesn't work.\nFor all this, the entire film is enjoy-able. It is a brilliant visual experience,\nwith some memorable and dramatic\ncamera work. Connery, Charlotte Rampling and Sara Kestelman bound around\nwith unbridled enthusiasm, and somehow manage to make the dialogue bear-able. It is interesting to see John Alderton of \" My Wife Next Door\" giving a fair performance as a cynical and bitter\nmember of the commune.\nThis is by no means a\"2001\" and says\nnothing about anything\u2014but it is a trip\nworth taking.\nIn real life, changing society isn't always that easy. Frank Serpico joined the\nNew York City Police as a bright-eyed\ncadet, ready to fight alongside New\nYork's finest, to battle corruption and\ncrime, only to discover that the force\nitself was riddled with graft and corr up tion. Serpico kept clean, resisted threats\nand blackmail, and was eventually a major witness to the Knapp Commission\nof 1971, which exposed corruption of\ngrotesque proportion in the NYPD, and\ncaused the resignation and/or indictment\nof half the police force's senior officials\nin New York.\nThe story of Serpico's personal cr u sade, with the central questions in the\nstory about the sort of man who will\nbecome a policeman, and stay true to\nsome sort of ideal and fight the system,\nis the subject of Sidney Lumet's \"Ser-pico\". It is a thunderous bore. Al Pacino\n(of The Godfather fame) struggles manfully against the rest of the cast and\nLumet's direction, but the film falls flat,\nand avoids the issues. Read the book.\nSpeaking of books, I read \"The\nExorcist\" oh the train down from Manchester, then went to see the film. 1\nshould have stayed on the train. Despite\na fine try at the role of the possessed\ngirl's mother, by Ellen Burstyn, and some\nastonishing (and vaguely unpleasant)\nmake-up and special effects, \"The Exorcist\" is never better than ordinary. This\nsurprised me as William Peter. Blatty's book is at least as fine a novel as \"The\nGodfather\", written in a similar commercial vein.\nWilliam Friedkin, the Oscar-winning\ndirector of \"The French Connection\"\nclearly tried his best to repeat his earlier\nsuccess, and could have done so. However, he was unlucky. Or was there more\nto it than that? Maybe he'd better get\nthe priests in for his next picture.\nbacked up by a National Strike: they\nwere soundly beaten and the demo will\ntake place on May 12. Another\namendment passed easily against Exec,\nadvice called for an extraordinary conference to be held to consider the proposals in the grants review when it has\nbeen announced (just like the one held\nhere at IC last year this is likely to be\nheld in early June).\nA motion of censure on most of the\nBroad Left members of the NUS Exec,\nfor failing to call, as members of the\nNUS Exec, for students to vote Labour\nin the Genera! Election, wa.s lost on a card vote by 248K to.I98K. In their\npersonal capacities of course they all\nworked for a Labour victory. A further\nmotion of censure on; Stuart Paul for\ndisrupting the grants campaign by the\nway he conducted his campaign for\nNUS Presidency was however passed\nby an even larger margin.\nThe grants campaign has been going\nnow for 18 months or more and obviously there is great difficulty in finding\nnew tactics to employ so the. tactics to\nbe used for the rest of 'the year are\nmuch as before, being mainly designed\nto win support from local and national\ntrade unions and Labour Party groups.\nApart from the demo, local: action is\ncalled for particularly in the week May\n1\u20147, this to include a national protest\nwrite-in by students to the Government\nand a mass petition circulated amongst\nthe public.\nThere is something for everybody to\nget involved in, so if you want to j influence the outcome of the grants\"\nreview, get stuck in now! \u2022\nP.

It is divided into sub-headings, all of which\nare linked and should be Of interest to most of you.\nNUS Insurance/Travel Office\nAs many of you will know, Ithis \"office\" has been\nbehind a counter in the Room at i the Top for Ithe past\ntwo years, and before then was behind a desk in the\nJunior Common Room, College Block. The reason it\nwas moved to Room at the Top was as a focal point\nfor a room destined to be the ce nl tre of activity on an\nopen-plan scheme.\nAs it happened, there was no security on RATT, and consequently all the information/office equipment\nwas regularly destroyed or ait the least tampered with\nby elements of our student intelligentsia.\nThe only other people to use RATT, were the Student Councillor, Ents for meetings, and a very few\npeople for evening meetings. As such the area was\nbeing greatly wasted in use, and it was felt, could be\nbetter used for other purposes. Consequently, NUS Insurance/Travel have moved into the old Committee\nRoom off the lower lounge, and the required work in\nthis room should now be completed. It is hoped that\nthe office will now be in easy reach of students and\nthat you will make use of their excellent opportunities\nfor saving money.\nRoom at the Top\nAs I have just mentioned, the RATT is Ito be used\nfor other business than merely NUS Travel/Insurance.\nThe plan which you see on this page is an outline of\nwhat alterations will take place, and it is hoped that\nyou Will make full use of the new room.\nAC C,RC C, and SCC will make use of the three\nrooms on the North side of the RATT, and SCAB( Ents, Folk, OpSoc, etc.) will use the large room on\nthe South side and the Student Councillor the small\nroom.\nAlterations should be complete by ne xl t October, and\nI would think that ne xl t year's Deputy President will\ngive full instructions as to the use of the room.\nPrinting Unit\nOver the past two terms we have been investigating\nthe possibility of reducing the cost of Felix (at present\nabout \u00a3130 per issue!!). \"Not too difficult\" you may\nsay \"merely go to a cheaper printers\". But it is not\nthat easy, we are now dealing with the cheapest printers, so where do we go?\nWhat we are doing is Ito move over to printing\nFelix on offset litho. This involves a vast capital\noutlay for machines (\u00a38,000) and paper (\u00a320,000), but\ngives us the chance of reducing the cost of Felix to\nabout \u00a330 per week. The college have agreed to pay\nthe entire of the capital, and the equipment and paper\nhas now been ordered, and should be installed by July\nof this year.\nThe printing room will be behind a partition in the\npresent Upper Lounge (next to the Felix office) and\nmust, as I am sure you appreciate, be out of bounds\nto students. We will be employing our own typist and\nmachine operator for the Unit, and thus will be completely self-contained.\nOn the machines, we will be printing Felix, Phoenix,\nRag mag, USK Handbook, Blue book, Union diary,\nSocieties Handbook, and maybe some College publica-t ions. IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR SOCIETIES OR INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE BUMP H PRINTED ON THE MACHINES. The person in the Union ito speak to about these\nmachines is myself this year, and Mike Williams\n(Publicity Officer) next year.\nto back stairs t Ctte Rm D6 Welfare\nCtte Bra B Social, Cultural,& Amusements\nBoard\nRiding Jar in s^ Ctte Km A Clubs Cttes\nie.

And now to get on the final item of the\nreport dealing with the scrappy piece of junk which\nwas put out by the Communist Parity last week about\nthe events at Essex University. Although they cannot\nhelp being biased in what they write I feel some of\ntheir comments are totally unjustified, and that\" we\nshould look at the Essex University situation in the\ngrimmest light possible. The events at Essex University began by a group of left Wing militants occupying\npart of the administration block \"as their act of support for the Grants campaign\". During this occupation 36 students were charged with attempting Ito stop\nlectures and generally cause a disruption. These 36\nstudents, it seems, are probably Ithe more political\nelement of the Students Union and as such it is felt\nthat they have been victimised against. After the occupation three of these 36 students were expelled from\nthe College and arising from this a group of people\ndecided Ithat their expulsion was unjustified and that\nthey would picket the College in order to try and\nreverse the decision.\nNo-one can condone the actions of Vice Chancellor\nSloman, but at the same time no-one can condone\nthe actions of the students. From Ithe position of a very un militant College we can see quite clearly that\nthe militancy which has occurred at Essex has done\nabsolutely nothing for the Grants Campaign, nothing\nfor the three students who were expelled and less than\nnothing for the students' image as a whole. I believe,\nas I am sure many other students believe, that the\naction of the militant students from Essex and also\nthe droves (less than 100) of militants from outside\nEssex is not representative of the student body as a whole and not even representative of the majority of\nstudents at Essex University. This has been more than\nadequately shown by the amounts of \"mass support\"\nthat has been mobilised. Only a few dozen Essex\nstudents spent their holidays manning the \"picket\nlines\" during the Easter vacation, and only 200 of\ni them attended the picket on 24/4/74 (last week). This\nis out of a total of 2,100 students on what is a campus type university (i.e. majority living in). Also,\nonly 500 (out of a total membership of 660,000) students actually attended the demo last week.\nYou may have seen in the Communist Party bump h sheet that the Executive sent a letter to Essex University condemning the actions of the students. This\nletter was sent as an expression of i the ideas outlined\nabove in order to try and show that not all students\nbelieve that militancy is the only way to success. Also,\nin the communist bump h sheet it is indicated that\nFelix has been taken over by the Executive, i.e. that\nit has now become a biased and bigoted newspaper.\nThis is an absolute load of bullshit. 90% or more\nof the articles in Felix are submitted by individual persons or clubs and are merely set out in the newspaper by Mr. Wadsworth. If it had been taken over by\nthe Exec then surely this would not be so. As for the\nstatement in the bump h sheet that negotiation is not\nthe way ito success this top, I believe, is false. A great\ndeal of negotiation has gone on in this college over\nthe past few years and I don't think anyone of us can\ngrumble at the deal which we are getting, i.e. Hall\nRents \u2014 the lowest in the country and almost static\nfor the past three years; Refectory prices are the lowest\nthroughout London, this year's increase being approximately one-fifth of that experienced at LSE; the\nUnion Grant from the LEAs being approximately\n\u00a326,000 and our sub vent ion from the College a further \u00a320,000 plus \u00a348,000 for welfare, health and\nsports facilities; and \u00a380,000 extra this year spent by\nthe College on items which the Union has requested\u2014\nsuch as printing equipment, paper, improvements and\nmodifications to Union premises. We have a situation\nhere where the Union and the College can work together and I feel that it is only the Union who could\npull out of this cost and this the College most certainly does not want.\nI will leave it up to you as an individual to judge\nthe events at Essex. The above is the feeling of the\nExecutive and as such we feel it would be the opinion\nof the majority of students at IC, although anyone of\nus would be only too delighted to discuss the issue\nwith you if your views are different to ours.\nSAVE AS YOU LEARN (cont.)\nbe rs. Remember that\nEndsleigh preferential\nterms continue throughout life. It is understood\nby most people that heath\nis very important and\nequally so ill-health can\naffect the terms of Life\nAssurance in the future.\nIn some instances occ up a tion, overseas travel, and\nhazardous sports or pastimes can substantially\naffect the cost of life as-sur ance. Advice taken\nearly in life is therefore\ninvaluable and can pay\nbig dividends in the\nfuture, so come and see\nyours truly at Committee\nRoom \" A\", Union Buildings, on either Monday's or Thursday's from 12.30\n2.30 p.m. House Purchase\nYou may not be considering buying a house\nright now but you almost\ncertainly will one day.\nEndsleigh offer advice on\nBuilding Society investment which will be a great help when you do\ncome to make probably\nthe single most important\npurchase of your life.\nNEW OFFICE\nThe Endsleigh office\nhas now moved along\nwith NUS Travel to Committee Room A, Union\nBuildings and the Insurance office is open during\nterm time twice weekly\non Mondays and Thursdays from 12.30-2.30 p.m. Immediate cover is available for motor, property\nand travel insurances, including winter sports,\nmountaineering and motorcycle insurances.\nI hope to see you there.\nTED YORK, Insurance\nAdvisor, Endsleigh Insurances (Brokers) Ltd.\nSCAB MANIFESTO\nThis Thursday lunchtime there's a Union\nMeeting in Ithe Great\nHall, at which you'll be\nelecting ne xl t year's SCAB\nChairman/Social Sec. In\nthe next few lines I'd like\nto tell you why I'm standing for that post, and to\nurge you to' vote for me\nin that election.\nFirstly let me outline\nmy idea of the job of\nSCAB Chairman. He\nshould\n1 Optimise the standard,\nrange and quantity of\nEntertainments provided by IC Union.\n2 Get the maximum co-. operation possible between SCAB Organisations for the benefit\nof IC Students.\n3 Maintain and improve\nthis year's good relations between SCAB\nand College.\n4 Represent and safeguard the interests of\nSCAB organisations on\nCouncil.\nNow let me tell you\nwhat I 've done this year\nand why 1 think it will\nenable me to carry out\nall the above duties effectively and to the full. This\nyear I 've worked on the\nEnts committee, giving\nme an up to date knowledge of the problems involved in putting on big\nmoney events at IC. I 've\nalso worked on Linstead\nDisco which has given me\na good idea of how the\nsmaller SCAB organisations function. This experience will be of invaluable help in carrying out\n1 and 2.\nI 've also been involved\nin producing and presenting a fortnightly discussion programme on\nSTOIC. Ability gained in\nchairing these discussions\nwill enable me to chair\nSCAB effectively and un-bias ly. Organisational experience in producing\nthese programmes and in\nsuccessfully obtaining\nsupport for a Campus\nRadio Station at IC, will\nprove of immense assistance in carrying out all\nof the duties of SCAB\nchairman to the full.\nBut doesn't the job of\nSocial Sec require some\nsecretarial experience ?\nNO, Mike Simmons this\nyears Social Sec (resigned\n\u2014Ed) says that the job\nrequires absolutely no\nsecretarial experience.\nEven so haven'tI got\nenough on my plate without taking on more?\nNo, all that I shall be\ndoing next year outside\nacademic work, will be\nIC Radio and, if elected,\nthe job of SCAB chair-man. If not elected, I will\ncontinue to work with\nEnts and help se it up IC\nRadio. As far as STOIC\nis concerned, I have already told both this year's and next year's Chairman, that I will be doing\nno work for STOIC after\nJuly 1st,1974. In addition to carrying\nout the duties of SCAB\nChairman I would also\nencourage\n1 All SCAB organisations to be more ambitious in what they present (particularly C CU Ents).\n2 A diversification of all\nentertainments to cater\nfor all tastes.\n3 The development of\nlunchtime entertain-ment, as Started this\nyear by Operatic Society.\nWell I hope that's convinced you that I'm the\nright man for the job. I'm standing because I believe\nI can carry out the duties\nof SCAB chairman/Social\nSec and improve entertainments here alt IC better than any of the other\ncandidates standing. So\ncome along and vote for\nme this Thursday, 1 p.m. Thanks for listening.\nClive Dewey\n\n"

Well, several boring\nthings: the election of a committee, ratification of a constitution, very short reports, etc. But also there\nwill be a few motions. Why are these important? Well\nthey will give the committee a mandate with\nwhich to negotiate with the relevant authorities. So\ncome along, it shouldn't last more than an hour.\nThe present \"Postgraduate Plight\" has warranted\nleading articles in Nature and New Scientist, a two\nweek report in THES, letters in the Times and the\nGuardian, and questions in the House of Lords. The\ngrant for the next three years will be announced\nsoon. So, will our plight be over, or just entering a new phase? Just in case of the latter, we must be pre-pared.\nThe postgraduate group has been active in this college for just over a year now. It has achieved a lot.\nLet's keep it active, there's plenty more to achieve\nyet.\nIC PGG AGM i( FRIDAY 3rd MAY\nJl pm. Elec Eng 408\nI ELECTIONS ELECTIONS\n1 Nomination Papers for P.G. Affairs Officer,\n} Secretary and Treasurer now up Union\n| Lower Lounge till 1/5/74\nMUDDLE\nOVER\nREPORT\nThe Exploratory Committee is a College committee with two student\nrepresentatives which meets occasionally to discuss things that it is mandated to discuss. Recently\na Board of Studies Meeting referred to it the\nHouse of Commons Expenditure Committee's report on Postgraduate\nEducation. So it (the\nExploratory Committee)\nset about making a report\non the report. It met Without the two student mem-be rs, mainly because of a lack of communications\nat the Union's end, and\nproduced a report. This\nreport was totally unacceptable to the postgraduate group, and indeed most students who\nhave seen it, so we wrote\nanother report i.e.a report of a report of a report if you follow.\nWhat are these reports?\nWell the government report recommends-loans to\nsupplement grants and\nhigher fees for overseas\nstudents. The College\ncommittee's report says\nthat it does not oppose\nloans in principle as long\nas the grant element is\nadequate, and additionally it does not oppose\nhigher fees for overseas\nstudents in principle but\nit depended on whether\naverage or .marginal costs\nwere charged. Our report\nis much simpler.\nWe oppose loans and\noppose higher fees for\noverseas students in principle. THE POSTGRADUATE NEWS\nHALFPAPER OF IC\nIssue No. 10\nNUS DISCOVERS PG's The NUS has at last\ndecided that postgraduates are students and now\nhas policy covering nearly\nall aspects of postgraduate education. The main\nsubstantive motion was\nconcocted by UCL, Imperial and others, and\nthis was passed by an\noverwhelming majority.\nThe many aspects dealt\nwith in the substantive\nmotion include research,\ngovernment policy on PG education, overseas post-graduates, demonstrating\nand tutoring rates, relations with industry, cooperation with trade unions, working conditions, relations Vis a vis\nthe 'supervisor' and finally the need ito organise\nactive postgraduate associations. On research the conference declared that 'The\nfunction of research is to\nprovide information and\nfurther the understanding\nof the environment of\nman, so that he might\nbest gain advantage from\nthe resources available to\nhim, in all fields of human\nendeavour' (Wot's that\nBrian). Conference also\nstated that postgraduates\ncarry out much of the research in many departments and as such are an\nindispensable (but of\ncourse) part of the uni-vers i ties. As far as government\npolicy on PG education\nwas concerned, conference took note of the\nthird report from the Executive Committee (Edu-cation and Arts sub-com-mitte e) and the fact that\nthe NUS executive has\npublically condemned it.\nMost of the proposals\nembodied in this report,\nsuch as loan subsidies for\nBritish Students and increases in overseas' students fees were totally\nunacceptable.\nThe fact that overseas\npostgraduates (where are\nyou?) have special problems has been accepted by\nACCOMMODATION\nCommencing 1974/75,\nthere is a new rule that\nall postgraduates may be\nresident for 2 years regardless of previous years\nin residence as an under-graduate; any years in residence as an undergraduate are discounted.\nThere may be some\nstudents who did not\nknow about his ruling,\nand assumed they were ineligible to apply because\neither\n(a) they had been in residence for one year as an\nundergraduate and one\nyear as a postgraduate, pr\n(b) they had been in residence for 2 years as an\nundergraduate.\nIF YOU COME INTO\nEITHER OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO APPLY FOR RESID EN CE NEXT SESSION.\nApplication forms are\navailable from the Residence Office, Room 161,\nCollege Block.\n(a) The closing date for\npostgraduates who have\nhad one year in residence\nas a postgraduate is 12.00\nnoon, Monday, 6th May,\n1974.\n(b) The closing date for\npostgraduates who have\nnot lived in residence as\na postgraduate is 1s tAu gust, 1974.\nNUS. Among these are\ntheir weak financial position the churlish behaviour of the British government in preventing them\nfrom taking part time\njobs and the threat of visa\nremoval (i.e. deportation)\nif they join trade unions.\nFinally conference objected to the fact that\noverseas students have to\npay excessive tuition\n(what tuition?) fees.\nOn demonstrating and\ntutoring rates conference\nexpressed their disgust at\nthe use of postgraduates\nas cheap labour, and declared that payment\nshould be tied to the\nbasic rate of the University lecturer's pay scale.\nWhile conference had\nno objections to industry\nsponsoring postgraduate\nstudents, the style and\nnature of Ithe research\nshould not be rigidly dic-tate d. Conference declared its distaste for military research and any\nother type not beneficial\nto mankind. On trade\nunions, conference was in\nfavour of complete co-operation.\nWorking conditions\nshould be conducive to\nthe type of research being\ndone. Ready and frequent\ndiscussions with the supervisor are essential, and\nhe should be available for\nat least nine months of\nthe year. Under their section conference also declared that all fees and\ncosts incurred by the student in the preparation of\nthe thesis should be paid\nby the grant awarding\nbody.\nThis is but a brief summary document. If any\nPG wants to read\nit, please contact me.\nT. ABRAHAM.\nSAVE AS\nYOU LEARN\n\\-----------------------In these days of rising\nprices and inflation it is\nrefreshing to be able to\nbring to the attention of\nstudents and graduates a way of saving money. I am referring to the range\nof policies offered by\nEndsleigh Insurances, the\nwholly owned brokerage\nof the NUS.\nThose of you who have\nhad occasion to need insurance for your car,\nproperty or overseas\ntravel have almost certainly encountered the\ntraditional attitude towards students requiring\ninsurance. Students are a bad risk, extra premiums\nmust be imposed is the\ngeneral consensus of op in ion. END SLEIGH DISA G REE. Endsleigh were set up\nby the NUS to provide a full Insurance Broking\nService to students and\ngraduates in 1965. From\nthe starting point of a single room we have expanded to a network of\n37 NUS Insurance Centres throughout the U.K. This remarkable growth\nhas been achieved by\noffering policies in all\nclasses of insurance, at a discount. At the same\ntime the quality of the insurance cover is guaranteed by Endsleigh only\ndealing with leading insurance groups. Endsleigh's strength lies in the\n600,000 membership of\nthe NUS and the even\ngreater number of graduates. The Conventional and\nthe Unconventional\nThe insurance requirements of students and\ngraduates often mean that\nconventional insurance\npolicies do not provide\nadequate protection alt a reasonable coSt. Endsleigh have therefore\ndeveloped a range of policies which are exclusive\nto students and graduates.\nIn addition Endsleigh are\nable to provide cover for\nsome of the more unusual\nrisks: Last year for instance elephants joined\nthe Stampede for Endsleigh policies. A Students\nUnion required cover during rag week and it was\nprovided, elephants and\nall!\nCover for Top Climbers\nInsurance of the British\nTorre Egger expedition\nrepresented the greatest\ncoup yet for the special\nmountaineering policy\nannounced last year as an\naddition to Endsleigh's ISIS range of policies. Al though this is not Ithe first\nlarge expedition to use\nISlS-4he1973 Jotenheim expedition was insured by Endsleigh\u2014it is\nthe first world-class one.\nThe ISIS Travel Insurance schemes operated by\nEndsleigh have always\nenjoyed considerable success for two particular\nreasons. Firstly, the rates\nare competitive and the\npolicies offer wide ranging\ncover. They are uncomplicated and easy to un-der stand. Property Insurance\nThe Endsleigh technical\ndepartment has now successfully incorporated the\nvirtues of the ISIS system\ninto a range of property\ninsurances. As the needs\nand circumstances of\ngraduates differ from\nthose of students, it was\ndecided to diversify into\nseparate contracts for\neach, as has been done in\nMotor Insurance. Each\npackage deals especially\nwith the type of accommodation in which the\ninsured is most likely to\nbe living; the student plan\npolicy is specifically for\nhalls of residence, shared\nflats, lodgings and bed-sitters, but whilst the\nGradplan property insurance policy includes cover\nfor non self-contained and\nshared accommodation, it\nis primarily for the graduate living alone with his\nfamily in completely self-contained premises. Both\npolicies are primarily\ncontents insurances, that\nis Ithey are designed to\ncover household goods\nand personal effects\nagainst a variety of risks,\nwhilst in the home of the\ninsured person.\nMotor Insurance\nThe only compulsory\ninsurance in the U.K.( apart from National Insurances) is motor in sur ance. By law you must\neffect insurance to protect third parties, which\nincludes \u2022 passengers,\nagainst loss or injury. It is\ntherefore not surprising\nthat Endsleigh provide\nspecial policies for students (Student Plan) and\ngraduates (Gradplan).\nLuckily at Endsleigh we\nare able to give you value\nfor money. You will be\npleasantly surprised to\nread that Endsleigh can\nactually cut the cost of\nyour motoring. Ask for a quotation, you will not be\ndisappointed.\nLIFE ASSURANCE\u2014\nFOR NOW AND LATER\nIt is not always appreciated that Life Assurance is not just a means\nof providing financial\nsecurity for dependants;\nit is also a very valuable\nmeans of building up\ncapital for future needs.\nThe earlier you start, the\nbetter the terms available.\nIndeed almost everyone\ntaking out Life Assurance\nfor the first time wishes\nhe had done so earlier.\nThere are many different\ntypes of policy and the\nEndsleigh approach is to\ndiscuss your own particular needs before making a recommendation. Endsleigh offer a full range of\nLife Assurance and Savings schemes available at\na discount for NUS mem-cont'd page 5\n\n"

Present price is about\n\u00a314. Council endorsed its\nearlier decision of 4.2.74 to\nbuy these.\nThe financial estimates\nfor 1974-75 were carefully\nconsidered.

(Full copies of\nthe report are available\nfrom the Union Office),\nThis constitutes a summary of the proceedings,\nderived from the, as yet,\nun ratified minutes.\nSTUDENT JOURNALIST CONF\n8th \u2014ll th April 1974\nThe conference was for\nstudents interested in newspapers and handbooks and\ndealt with most matters in\na rather general way.\nThe first talk of the conference was from Brian\nJones, Northern Editor of\nThe Guardian. He spent\nmost of his time criticising\nthe layout of the student\nnewspapers he had in front\nof him (not Felix). The\nmain points he made were\n(1) to keep the typefaces\nuniform (2) not to overprint in colour (3) and to\nput fillers in at the bottom\nof the page, not halfway\ndown.\nNext was supposed to be\na practical session. We\nwere put into groups and\ntold to produce a news\nsheet (two sides of A4) on\nsix topics which we could\nget the details on by bribing the Salford exec. Most\n(at Salford University)\ngroups decided that this\nwas rather silly, more fitted to a school project\ngroup than to a NUS\nconference. Eventually\nthree out of 10 papers\nappeared.\nLater we met Peter\nBarnes from the Daily\nMirror who spoke about\nphoto-journalism. This\nwas not very relevant to\nstudent newspapers.\nThere was a report back\nfrom the Advertising\nAgency Working Party.\nApparently last year's conference set up this party,\nand a feasibility study was\nto have been made. Predictably, nothing had come\nof this, and it was more\nor less decided to set up\nanother working party,\nand to have a new report\ndrawn up. We could then\nprovide similar services to\nDominion Press and JEP\nand can make them available for all students. This\nagency would initially deal\nwith handbooks, then extend to newspapers.\nA talk on Business and\nManagement followed.\nThis was rather un in s pir ing, and would have been\nbetter directed at someone\ntrying to sell a book.\nA man from A.B. Dick\nprinters spoke about printing methods, mainly litho.\nHe dealt with the different\nplates that can be used,\ntheir suitability and cost.\nWe were then given the\n'Report back from the\nStudent Press Agency\nWorking Party'. The general idea is to set up a central office to collect all\nstudent newspapers and\ngather together main news\nitems to send out to all\nstudent papers. The NUS\nexec, seemed more interested in this th a a anyone\nelse, but it was agreed to\nset up a new working\nparty.\nThe best talk of the conference was from Letraset.\nIt included films, slides\nand handouts of free\nsamples, wall e harts, etc.\nThe only other lecture\nof any interest was on student broadcasting. A girl\nfrom Essex University\nRadio told us about the\ntimetable of their station.\nAltogether the conference was well worth at-tending, especially: for\nthose like myself who had\nlittle prior knowledge on\nthe subjects discussed.\nIf anyone wishes to find\nout more about any of\nthese topics I will be quite\nwilling to discuss them in\ndetail with those people.\nJacqui Gerrard.\nNUS CONF\nOnce again this Easter\nthe ritual \"NUS Conference\" occurred. And once\nagain the politicians of tomorrow met to practice\ntheir talents and try to get\ntheir names in the Daily\nTetlegraph. It was estimated that the delegates\nsplit roughly into three\ngroups\u2014340 million com-munis ts, international\nmarxists, maoists, revolutionary socialists, and\nother moderate organisations; three un aligned and\ntwo conservatives.\n\"The moderates suffered\noutset. Stuart Apall, 57,\nfailed in his bid for Presidency of the Union, and\nthis he blamed on the\nConservative faction of\nthe conference. One de le gate, Cedric Foreskin, 94,\ntold me it was a victory\nfor common sense and he\nhoped there would be no\nrecurrence of such miscarriages of justice.\nProbably the most controversial decision of the\nconference was to prevent\nfascists from speaking at\nUniversities by violent or\nmurderous methods. I spoke to our own Trevor\nPhilpott about this decision and asked him if he\nsaw the removal of the\nfreedom of speech as\nsomething of a fascist policy itself. Mr. Philpott,\nreplied that he had voted\nfor the motion because\nfascist speakers cause violence and, since there are\nno intellectuals at Universities, no useful discussions\ncould take place. Mr.\nPhilpdtt went on: \"Tfie\nConservative Society never\nask me to speak at their\nmeetings\u2014or any of my\nfriends like Mr. McGoohay, Jimmy Red or J. StarIynne. I think freedom of\nspeech should apply only\nwhen people say the right\nthings\". When questioned\nmore generally about the\nconference Mr. Philpott\nrecounted that \"some of\nthe birds were quite nice\".\nMr. Philpott is 13.\nI asked a fresher, Cyntia Smegma, for her impressions of the confer-en ce. She replied: \"Before\nI came here I thought\nmotions were something to\ndo with Crapping. Now I know!\".\nCan you\nspeak\nEnali\nSome people can't. In\nfact, an estimated 60- per\ncent of the world's population can't. And an estimated 2 per cent of the\nstudent population of Imperial College have difficulties with the language.\nThis year, 90 overseas\nstudents were taking English classes in college\nduring the first term. Perhaps half of these found\nlanguage a severe handicap\nto their a cade mfc \u00abnd\nsocial life. We can guess\nBlack & White\nor\nChrome and\nCrimson\nTenacious black and\nwhite poster makers are\nrife on the campus. Don't you think that posters in\nheavy lettering punctuated\nwith blotches and uninspiring sketches makes\neven the most extraordinary event seem average if\nnot a little bit dull?\nYou always notice the\ncoloured posters.

That prospective students who have not had\nEnglish as the language of\ninstruction for some part\nof their education should\ntake an examination in\nSeptember immediately before joining college. The\nexamination would be set\nby the college, compulsory,\nand taken in London.\n2. ' That a th ree months\ncourse in English be made\navailable preceding the\nexamination for those that\nwant it.

Heffer & Bateman were noted and suitably commented upon).,\nOn arrival at our Guest\nHouse the intriguing paradox arose of how to fit\nten (male) bodies into\neight beds. The subsequent events in room 7\nwill never be known, but\nthe respective latecomers\nto the breakfast table\nwould suggest the arrangement was not too\nincompatible. (What\nabout room 9, Ian?).\nOn Good Friday we\nplayed our first match\nagainst the Galleymackers (from Ashby-de-la\nZouch). The \"All Star X\" plus an obliging goalkeeper from Bath University,\nput up an amazing display of hockey skills, but\nwent down 3-2.\nThe same afternoon we\nplayed Leahoe. The game\nopened in grand style\nwith a scintillating first\nhalf performance by IC.\nHaving opened a two goal\nlead, we decided to give\nLeahoe a chance, which\nthey promptly took and\nequal lise d. Unfortunately\na bit of needle crept into\nthe match, with one pile\nup, in particular, of\nwhich the 1st XV pack\nwould have been proud.\nIn this game, Richard\nCameron was forced to\nretire with a fractured\nappendage. Whilst this reduced our squad to nine,\nwe were grateful to have\nan efficient umpire for the\nrest of our matches.\nSaturday morning's op-pon ents, Lowestoft Railway, proved easy meat.\nMick Downs slammed a \"four-trick\" (even without his gloves) and consequently bought a round at lunchtime. Nigel Woodhouse also scored to give final tally of\n5-0.\nThe afternoon's match\nagainst Haverhill was\nplayed in utter confusion\nwith both teams playing\nin blue and white. However, IC overcame the\nproblem better than our\nopponents and triumphed\n2-0.\nWe were al! glad to\nhave a day off on Sunday\nto nurse our wounds.\nTim Hanson made better\nuse of his time than most\nby picking up a fiver (his\nsecond within a month.\nClub treasurer would you\nbelieve!) Most evenings\nwere spent patronizing\nthe 'Spread Eagle' (it appears that we left that\npub branded as a gang\nof lunatics!) Our revered\ncaptain MDD claims that\nhe won the 'Fizz-Buzz'\nchampionship but\nin reality he was too\npissed to remember exactly what happened. The\nevenings ended with the\ninevitable room 9 Card\nSchool (How much were\nyou down Tim?).\nOn Monday we were\nback in action against\nthe Tightons XI( from\nBristol). This was a memorable game for Bob\n(Hopalong) Evans. Not\nonly did he snap up two\ngoals, but he was also\nstruck in the face with a full-blooded shot from\nDave Harrison. Dave was\nimmediately congratulated by the rest of the poker crew (Bob had a lucky run the previous\nnight). Two more goals\ngave us a comfortable 4-1\nvictory. This game was\nplayed with the hysterical\nsupport of two fourteen\nyear old girls who, rumour\nhas is, had been suitably\nseduced by a certain member of the team who shall\nremain nameless. I believe they came from\nLeeds. (Isn't that right\nTim?)\nEveryone appeared to\nenjoy themselves and the\nresults show that the tour\nwas also a success from\nthe hockey viewpoint.\nP5, W3, Dl,L I, F15,\nA6.\nGoalscorers: M. Downs\n7, D. Harrison 5, R. Evans 2, N. Woodhouse\nr. \u2022\nTeam: Mick (Spot the\ncorrect wife) Downs; Bob\n(Hopalong) Evans; Tim\n(I can lose more money\nthan you can) Hanson;\nMike (You've got a lot\nof hockey in you) Hatcher; Richard (Fingers)\nCameron; Nigel (Hit a tit) Woodhouse; Dave\n(Give the goalie a chance)\nHarrison; Dave (Wat a mover) Balderson; Ian\nRead (Read 1); John\n(Super-cripple) Andrews.\n(Original script by IGR,\nlibellous additions by\nJELA and RCE).\nRUGBY\nRUGBY CLUB TOUR\nThe tour party arrived\nat Victoria very promptly\nwith two minutes to\nspare, as recommended\nby British Rail. A quiet\nrail trip to Dover was followed by an even quieter\nboat trip \u2014 after the first\nhour that is. After this\ntime everyone was too\npissed to speak and the\nduty free shop was sold\nout of all spirits. Rob\nJones had the first puke\nof the tour.\nWhen we had arrived\nat Ostend enough of us\nhad sobered up to carry\nthe rest off the boat. Here,\nTim Thomas signed a six\nmonth contract to film as\nthe naked partner of\nBrussels most famous\nmanikin and was assured\na bed for this time with\nthe raving poof ter in the\nfur coat. Customs officials\nwere seen to shake their\nheads in disgust as they\nsaw their beautiful country invaded by this apparently un civilised mob.\nThe train journey to\nBrussels was a continuation of the binge on the\nboat, pass the bottle being\nthe most popular game.\nThe scenes at the hotel\nwere chaotic. A dozen\npissed students milling\nabout the reception was\nnot the way to gain entry\nto the hotel and Tour\nManager was told to take\nthe party away to sober\nup. The rest of the party\nlay prostrate on the pavement outside the hotel in\na state of absolute bliss.\nThe rest of the evening passed quietly in the\nCafe Royale where our\nhosts of the following day\nentertained us. Entry to\nthe hotel was secured\nafter our passports had\nbeen confiscated and\nTour Manager had given\na promise of good behaviour (Raucous laughter).\nThe night in the hotel will\nnot be described as we do\nnot want any evidence in\nwriting.\nAn early start was\nmade to the next day\nwith a meeting at the\nRoyale at 1.15 p.m. From\nthere we were ferried to\nthe Brussels' British\nground. An entertaining\nand very enjoyable game\nwas played. We scored\nfirst after about 5 minutes through Martin Cotter but were pinned back\nfor a long period during\nwhich time Ithe Brussels\nBritish equalise d With a good try. However, the\nclass was beginning to tell\nand tries were scored by\nCotter (3), Hughes (2),\nSpanker (1) with a penalty in reply. IC ran out\nwinners by 31\u20149.\nWe were entertained\ncordially by the opposition and were given the\nBrussels rendering of\nEskimo Nell, after the\nmatch. In between tapping Roger the Dodger for\na job a lot of ale was\ndrunk\u2014at the Dodgers\nexpense of course.\nA thoroughly enjoyable\ntime was had for the rest\nof the time uninterrupted\nby any more matches as\nthe services team we had\narranged to play were all\nposted abroad the previous week (subtle).\nWe were invited to return annually but a biennial fixture was provisionally accepted. We\nwould like to thank ACC\nfor their generous grant\nespecially Big Max. His\nsilver hammer has been\nconfiscated to pay for the\nvarious damages that occurred on the tour.\n(The team wish to remain anonymous\u2014Sports\nEd.)\nCricket\nThe Cricket Club hopes\nto run three sides every\nWednesday and Saturday\ncovering all standards\nfrom Minor Counties to\nme.

March to\nDowning Street: 3 p.m. RALLY AND PUBLIC MEETING: 6 p.m., with speakers from\ntrade unions and socialist organisations (venue to be announced\nlater).\nLAST SEPTEMBER, the democratically elected Attend\u00a9 government was overthrown in\nChile by the local ruling class.\nSince then, the military junta\nthere has banned all trade unions\nand political parties, gagged the\npress and denied the people\nfreedom of speech. In order to\nstay in power, The Chilean military have so far murdered over\n30,000 people and put an equal\nnumber in prison.\nThe coup was encouraged and\nsupported by international companies such as ITT, who feared\nthat their ability to plunder the\nwealth of Chile would be lost to\nthem forever. Many of the companies who worked actively to\nbring down Allende have large\ninvestments in Britain. If the\nChilean people are to be aided\nin their fight against dictatorship,\nthe big monopolies, and the governments representing their in-te rests, must be denied the right\nto continue with their support\nfor the military butchers.\nBefore the last election, many\nLabour leaders publicly pledged\nthat a future Labour government\nwould break all links with the\njunta1. But once in office, the\nLabour Party have failed to\ncarry out their former promises.\nMr. Callaghan, the Foreign Secretary, has told parliament that\nhe intends to allow \u00a365 million\nworth of arms to be sent to this\nrepressive regime.\nEric Heffer has been the only\nmember of the government to\ndate with courage enough to condemn this decision. We support\nMr. Heffer'is statement, but recognise that words alone will not\nalter the government's attitude.\nAs many people as possible must\ndemonstrate on May 5th against\npresent government policy, which\nrepresents a betrayal of both\nthe Chilean and British working\nclass.\nHowever, this isn't the sole aim\nof the demonstration1. The gov-ern ment' s record has shown that\nwe cannot leave it to them to\nensure that the junta is denied\nall trade with Britain. If the government fails to change its policy on Chile, trade unionists have\nto make certain that the warships\nordered by the junta are not finished or launched from British\nshipyards. This action must be\ncombined with a general blacking\nof goods going to or coming from\nChile.\nThe Labour government must\nalso be made to change its attitude toward political refugees.\nOn this issue, Mr. Wilson's Social\nDemocratic counterparts in Sweden have a better record than\nhis own administration. They\nhave provided grants to employ\nlecturers, students and artists\ndeprived of their jobs and homes\nin Chile because of their commitment Ito the Chilean working\nclass. The Labour Government\nhas to exceed this example and\nopen the doors to all those who\nhave managed to escape from\nthe repression raging in Chile.\nDEMAND THAT THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT\nWITHDRAWS RECOGNITION NOW!\n\n"
