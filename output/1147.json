    "content": "22 Arts 1 June 1999\nSELF TAUGHT - DAVID BIAMEY\nSherfield Gallery\nH ow many elastic bands does\nImperial College use every day?\nJust speculating... I should think\nthat the offices, labs and hospitals use\nhundreds. If not thousands.\nDavid Blarney, the artist behind the\nrecent exhibition at the Sherfield Gallery,\nis deeply interested in elastic bands, just\nlike all you people who actually considered the question opening this article.\nDavid Blarney is probably not much interested in numbers, however. He is more\ninterested in how elastic bands fit into\nthe 'paraphernalia of an educational institution'. But how does he stretch our perceptions of the elastic band? You sit\ndown and watch a continuous loop of\nslides, each depicting an elastic band.\nSome elastic bands are new, clean,\nstarkly photographed. These would not\nbe out of place on the Ikea desk of an\nup and coming graphic designer. Other\nslides show elastic bands as grimy,\nscrewed up tangles of rubber. If you\nlooked hard enough, you might spot\nthese sprawled over the floor in the dusty\noffice of an ageing Cambridge don. All\ncontorted, twisted, like spaghetti. The\ncreations of an anguished pasta chef\ntripping on acid, perhaps?\nThe elastic bands are micro sculptures, devoid of scale and projected onto the\nwall at enormous size. You can see every\nfine structural detail. Initially you might\nthink: 'Oh, how boring, let me get back to\nbeauty of these everyday objects. This is\nsurely an exercise in Zen.\nEvery so often, the elastic bands\nare interspersed with travel brochure\nphotos - an alpine forest, a mountain\nmy fluid mechanics revision.' But stay a little longer and relaxation will set in. Now you\nwill concentrate on the detail and, if you're\nlucky or drunk, begin to appreciate the\nvalley, an orchid, a tropical fish, a beach\nat sunset. As these slides fade into their\nelastic band counterparts, they produce\nsome interesting, even soothing,\neffects. The elastic bands are one instal-la tion. The other is an empty slide projector struggling to focus its light beam\nonto a wall. A square of white light\nchanging size - in and out, blurring and\nfocusing. And all the time the projector\nfrantically whirring and clicking. Once\nyou have seen the elastic bands, this all\nseems to follow quite naturally. Is this\nZen again?\nMaybe this exhibition annoyed\nsome of you (\"this isn't art, damm it!\"), but if you responded in this way, I think\nthat you are missing the point entirely.\nChallenging our perception of art has\nbeen tried many times before, not least\nby the great Marcel Duchamps, who at\nthe beginning of the century either\nmade a good living passing off toilet\nbowels as sculpture, or challenged the\naccepted norms of his age. Which viewpoint you chose depends entirely on\nyour conception of art, of course!\nI don't believe David Blarney is trying to create phoney controversy. He is\nclearly too sophisticated an operator to\nsimply be repeating the old clich es of art\nversus non-art. Whatever it means (and\nit may mean nothing!), I liked it anyway.\nWilliam Burns\nA NIGHT AT THE MOVIES - ICSO CONCERT\nGreat Hall\nT he theme of the Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra's latest concert held on Friday 21 May was dis-tinc ti ve. Entitled A Night at the Movies,\nit featured popular music from past films.\nAccording to a member of the orchestra,\nthe feeling was that with the end of\nterm a few weeks away, they may as well\nhave some fun with the music they\nplayed. The concert itself was conducted,\nas always, by IC's Musician-in-Residence\nRichard Dickins with assistance from\nAndrew Zolinsky and Alex Cominos on\nthe piano and violin respectively. An\ninspired and passionate rendition of\nTchaikovsky's great work, the Swan Lake\nSuite, opened the evening. Everyone\nhas probably heard the piece at one point or another but may not know who\nwrote it. The performance had to be\npaused though due to a couple of late\narrivals with very loud boots. A technically\naccomplished performance of Rhapsody\nIn Blue by George Gershwin (a popular\ncomposer at IC) was played next.\nAfter the interval, the chairman of\nthe orchestra, Euan Barr was thanked\nfor his hard work and commitment\n\"absolutely wonderful\" piece of music\nthat he was conducting for the first time.\nMusic from Indiana Jones, the last performance according to the programme,\nfollowed. Once the piece had ended, a few unsuspecting members of the audience left somewhat prematurely as we\nwere then treated to a sensational and\ntopical encore of Star Wars.\nAudience reaction was generally\nfavourable although some complained\nthat the trumpets were too loud during\nseveral sections and there were too\nmany dod gy notes for their liking. As to\ntheir favourite piece, most people I spoke\nto believed the Gershwin was the best,\nalthough I personally favoured\nSchindler's List. The soloists, in particular,\ndelivered sensational performances.\nWhile as professional as the orchestra's previous efforts, this concert was probably not as accomplished as the last one\n(featuring Mahler among others).\nMansoor Choudhury & Tank Miller\nthrough the past years. He was presented with a bottle of champagne and\nproceeded to lead off with Jurassic Park,\nthe first of the John Williams compositions to be played. Next came Schindler's List which Mr Dickins introduced as an\nI "

    "content": "10 Travel Feature 1 June 1999\nAn Oasis in West Africa\nWorking and living in Ghana is not only personally satisfying,\nbut carries valuable CV points as well...\nClaire Bayntun shares her experience of\nliving and working in this vast African\nnation, and the benefits of voluntary\nwork in general.\nAmid a swirl of unstable, corrupt and often internally violent francophone countries, Ghana sits comfortably, as\nwide and grand as its women sat on the packed 'tro-tro' minibuses.\nWhere is Ghana? Despite my love of the world\nand an insatiable desire to be on 'speaking terms'\nwith as much of it as possible, I did not know where\nin the dark continent this country held court. I was\ngoing to live and work there, so I had better know\nits coordinates. I always feel that it is a traveller's duty to be able to find his own way to his destin a tion, just in case the pilot loses his sense of dire c tion. You never know.\nDramatic realignment was needed on leaving\nthat special aircraft-cabin climate. Heat and humidity hits like a wall. That warm tropical smell was familiar to me from other equatorial lands that I had\ntravelled in. Excited anticipation. Removal of the\nfleece.\nThe roads were roads. The houses, houses.\nAnd then... the shanty shacks, the pot hole crevasses,\nthe smells, the sounds... Africa. But each ensuing\nday there was a developing story.\nGhana is much more than a part of Africa: It\nreserves the right to be rather different from what\none might expect. African countries are always\ngoing to have an intriguing attraction; the warmth\nof their 'developing' status, a fascination with the\npeoples' 'almost' contentment in living with so lit-tle, and a jealous delight in the discovery of the freedom and closeness of their communities. I feel that\nthese sentiments are felt by most foreigners visiting\nAfrica. And, of course, being white-skinned in a continent of black, you get the honour of. being' a guest in their land', every moment of the day.\nUsually these features bring many added disadvantages and difficulties in moving and living\nwithin these countries. This is where Ghana becomes so special.\nGhana is an oasis In West Africa, or indeed, the\nAfrican Continent. It is remarkably safe, unswerving ly hospitable, and can offer those Western comforts\naround the clock, throughout the year. And the pe o ple? My new way of describing the most friendly of\npersonalities is to refer to them as 'Ghanaian'.\nThere are sand, palm-fringed beaches, bodyboarding waves, bars, clubs, restaurants, cinemas,\njet-skiing, go-karting; a place of plenty for anyone.\nYou can also teach in the schools, help with conservation projects in the tropical rainforests, do your\nMedical Elective in the hospitals and rural clinics,\npractice law In a firm, accountancy, IT, marketing, or\ncomplete your dissertation there.\nThese are just some of the opportunities available to you. I was there for four months, living,\nbreathing and working in Ghana with the organisation Teaching and Projects Abroad. Volunteers were\ndoing a full range of work, and an equally rigorous\nprogramme of social activities. Volunteers are the\ncreme de la creme, guaranteeing good company,\nfirm friends and excellent contacts for life. It can\nseem a bit odd to pay for the honour of 'volunteering' yourself, but when you are there you do\nrealise what you are achieving; real personal satisfaction is yours on an immediate basis. And the long\nterm advantages are also substantial in this present\nday scramble for graduate jobs.\nGhana is a superb destination for this pro-gram me. It is 'Third World', but with all the mod-cons\nif you need them. You can get a position in almost\nany area of work through the organisation. Both\nyourself and the people that you are assisting gain\nenormously from the cultural exchange.\nIf you fancy the idea, but not In Ghana, or want\nto use the opportunity to brush up on a language\nat the same time, the organisation also operates in\nMexico (Spanish), Brazil (Portuguese), Togo( French),\nIndia, Nepal, Russia .... And a few others! Wherever\nyou chose to work it is a great way to take a break\nfrom studying, whilst giving yourself something that\nwill help you in the long term; prospective employers look at volunteers who have worked in developing countries as resourceful and dynamic\nindividuals who can cope with challenges, have an\ninternational breadth of experience, and are, after\nall, a bit of a saint. Perfect.\nFor me, Ghana did offer something outstanding.\nIt has found itself clearly defined on my map; the\nemphasis is on having as much fun and madness as\npossible in a beautiful part of the African continent,\nfull of culture and tribal groups, and where you can\nlive 'a life of Riley1\nfor a few pounds. Try it - wedge\nyourself in next to a large Ghanaian lady, and feel\nthe ample ness this country has to offer.\nYou can contact Teaching and Projects Abroad on\n01903 859911, or e mail: ln fo@t each lng abroad.co.uk\n\n"

UCL Union, whose failure\nto support the occupations drew criticism\nfrom both students and London Student,\nare involved in the negotiations. Communication Officer Ollie Burbage-Hall\nBy Gareth Morgan\nsaid that the Union, although supporting\nthe students' claims, felt that the demonstrations had been counter-productive.\nMeetings could have taken place sooner\nwithout the disruption, he said.\nThe only genuine success story so far\nhas been at Goldsmith's College, as\nreported in Felix 1140. The High Court\nruled in favour of the protesting stu-dents, and prevented the College authorities from interfering with the education\nof anyone who was genuinely unable\nto pay.\nMeanwhile, there are increasing\nfears that the crisis in University funding\ncould result in further fees and costs for\nstudents. Rumours of top-up fees, differential fees and even outright privatisation abound, although no institution\nhas levied extra charges on Undergraduate degrees. Postgraduate courses are\nnot covered by law, though, and fees\nhave been rising. There are also 'hidden\nextras', such as library or internet access\n- there have been proposals to charge\nCambridge students for accessing websites based overseas.\nSir Ron Oxburgh, Imperial's Rector,\nhas ruled out top up fees, which would\nhave been added onto all students'\ntuition bills. Some leading universities\nhave contemplated differential fees, in\neffect charging more for expensive\ncourses such as sciences, but no institution has spoken out on either side of\nthe debate. The final power lies in the\nhands of the Secretary of State for Education, David Blunkett, who can block\nany efforts by universities to charge additional fees.\nDespite the fees, many universities\nwill still suffer a drop in funding next year\nof up to two percent, prompting many\npeople to wonder where the money has\ngone.\nBig Tutor is Still\nWatching You\nThe cameras in the BMS building,\nallegedly used to catch out rowdy\nmedics In lectures, have found their\nway into the Times Higher Education\nSupplement (THES). First discussed in\n'Mish Mash', Felix issue 1144, an article\nappeared on page 2 of THES on 21 May.\nThe cameras and microphones in\nthe building's lecture theatres are supposed to be there to aid com mu nica tion, and allow remote lecturing.\nHowever, some students have claimed\nthat the surveillance equipment could\nbe used to \"identify the trouble-makers\",\naccording to THES after speaking with\nWade Gayed, ICSM President.\nWhile all sides seem to be taking the\nentire affair as a bit of a joke, it has to\nbe asked whether the cameras are\nindeed used for such Draconian purposes and, if so, what is being done to\nstop it. _\nISSUe 1147\n1 June 1999\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nAssistant Editor & Films: David Roberts\nPhotographic Editor: Jonas Lindsay\nMusic Editors: Dennis Patrickson\n& Jason Ramanathan\nGames Editor: Gary Smith\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nClubscene: Giles Morrison,\nGurminder Marwaha &Joel Lewis\nArts Editor: Helena Cocheme\nScience Editor: Alokjha\ni Is your\npint really\nnecessary?\nKOSOVO\nAPPEAL\n0870 60 60 900\nCollection box in the Union Office\nDrought Continues\nThe eyebrows of statisticians have been\nraised all over Imperial College this week, as once again\nthe summer term proves to be devoid\nof any interesting news.\nAlthough this perceived drought\nseems to be far less severe than it\nwas last year, where space-wasting\narticles were given the glory of the\nfront page, Felix is still struggling to\nfind anything at all worth writing\nabout. The editor of Felix, Mr Ed Sexton, was heard to comment: \"There's no bloody news! Where's my lighter?\"\nSenior statistician Mr J Monkey commented: \"We have been attempting to find a correlation between this\nseemingly perennial lack of news and\nsome other factor or factors which is\nor are heavily prevalent in the summer\nterm. One theory is that Felix staff are\nfar too busy taking drugs to be bothered to find anything useful to do.\"\nFelix does not discount this point\nof view, although Mr Sexton believed\nthe constant and demeaning train of\nexaminations to which students are\nsubjected throughout the summer is\nmore likely to be the root of the pro b lem,- indeed, two senior Felixers have\nbeen in psychotherapy after attempting particularly fiendish contour integrals. Once again\nBy All Campbell Union staff were little help in providing\ninspiration, merely laughing hysterically when probed, but it seems likely\nthat this is just sour grapes due to\ntheir incarceration in the Union building during such beautiful weather Chris Ince, Deputy President (Finance\n& Services) was heard to comment \"I hate Unions\", although it was later\nrevealed he had in fact said \"Onions\".\nThe situation seems so desperate\nthat allegations of \"news-fixing\" are\nrife, with one intrepid amateur journalist allegedly considering staging his\nown death to help fill just one page.\nThe occurrence of such questionable\npractices as these have been strenuously denied by all those involved in\nthe Felix news team. One member\nrefuted all allegations: \"It wasn't mc\".\nOn a positive note, however, an\nold ping-pong ball was found underneath a table in Beit Hall. The ball was\napparently left there some years ago\nby a then fresher, and only surfaced\nlast week. The owner is believed to be\nin his mid-twenties, and could possibly\nplay ping-pong.

    "content": "20 Games 1 June 1999\nOfficial Formula 1 Racing (PC)\nEidos\n*\u2022\u2022\u2022\nI 've never quite seen why people get so\nexcited about Fl racing - after all, if you\ncompare it to driving up the Ml on a wet\nNovember Friday at about 7.30pm in a rusty Renault 4 which catches the wind\nside-on as you come over the hill just\nsouth of Sheffield, Fl definitely comes a poor second in terms of danger, excitement and general adrenaline rush. I think the attraction's more to do with\nglamour - the shiny cars, the film-star-esque drivers, the pit stop blondes and\nthe vast wad ges of cash that are put\ninto squeezing a couple fewer inches per\ngallon out of each engine. And Murray\nWalker of course, who is admittedly good\nvalue-for-money.\nThis is a very different racing game\nfrom Tank Racer. As suggested by the\ntitle, it is a simulation of Formula 1 Racing, except without the pit stop blondes\nand, in my case anyway, the film-star-esque drivers. Murray Walker's also lack-ing, but more of that later. The\ngame has been produced with\nthe blessing of the Formula 1\nAssociation, so can be\nii expected to be fairly close to\n\u2022 the real thing. It contains all\nthe stuff you'd expect - accurate (presumably - I haven't measured them) models of all\nthe F1 tracks, all the current\nteams and drivers, the ability to\ntweak your car's set-up, multiple camera views of all your\nfavourite crashes, black flags and so on.\nThe graphics are very nice, with the\ncars being modelled particularly nicely,\nand the circuits too are neatly represented. That having been said there are\none or two corners which have clearly\nbeen cut, particularly with the spec ta tors, who are represented by a flat panel\nof blobs, the sort of thing Jackson Pollock\nwould have knocked out as I a Christmas card to a friend \u2022 HH HH he didn't particularly like. jjB J BJ BJ BJ The sound is also a bit of a MW BBI disappointment, particularly fH| the narration. I 've already\nmentioned i he lack of Mur- yi?\"5 B \u2122 jP ray Walker (who'sI replaced by someone who\nsounds Australian), but more importantly\nthere has been little attempt to embed\nthe narration into the game, being limited to a few stock phrases which are slotted in almost at random. Equally the\nenvironmental sounds (engines, crowds,\netc) are all there, but seem curiously\nremote. These might seem like funny\nthings to pick up on, but this is meant to\nbe a simulation, not an arcade game,\nand the difference between a good sim\nand a bad sim often comes down to the\ndetails.\nThe driving is night-marl shl y hard; even on the\neasiest of settings with all\nthe cheats I could find\nswitched on (useful things\nike no damage, automatic\nbraking and gear chang-ing) I still found myself\nunable to go round the\nsimplest of circuits without\nspinning out several times.\nIf this is as accurate a representation of the cars handling characteristics as is\nbeing claimed, then Schumacher (x2), Hill, Irvine et al may deserve more\nrespect than I 've been willing to.give\nthem so far. I couldn't keep on the road\nwhen all I had to do was point the car in\nthe right direction -1 hate to think how\nthey manage it while worrying about\nchanging gears and doing pit stops. All-in-all? Well, it's not bad, but the\nlack of attention to the peripheral details\nhas damaged the game overall. I also\ncan't help feeling that they need to look\nat their car models - they are very sensitive, which might be fine for f1 drivers\nand fans, but is off-putting for someone\nwho's less interested. If you're looking\nfor an FT sim which is bang up-to-date\nand accurate, then this is the one to\nbuy. If you're looking for something a bit\nmore fun and a bit less anal, go for\nsomething like Microprose's venerable\nbut still playable R GP at least you'll\nstand a chance of winning a race or two.\nAnd for those of you looking for this\nweeks reference to our Beloved Games\nEditor -1 couldn't work it in. Sorry.\nDanny\nMarvel Super Heroes vs Streetfighter (PSX)\nVirgin Interactive\nPlayStation.\nSummary:\nSpidey and mates pick a fight with the\nStreet Fighter guys and gals.\nWhats It all about:\nAnother beat-em-up arcade conversion\nof a very special Capcom arcade game.\nBasically a product of an overactive imagination when some marvel comic fan\ncomplained that the street fighter blok es and lasses wouldn't last 30 seconds in a fight against some real heroes. Someone\nfrom Capcom overheard and spiderman\nand wolverine get to kick cam my' s electronic butt all the way across the screen.\nGood Graphics:\nArcade quality graphics once again.\nAlmost certainly the same engine as last\nweek's Darkstalkers 3 beat-em-up but\nwith characters you will instantly recognise - well anyone brought up on kids cartoons or marvel comics in the last twenty\nyears will. Supposedly sixty frames a second - they were a little too quick to count\nmyself so I 'll believe them for once.\nSeraphim\nSounds:\nStandard\nNeo-geo\nunit bleats\nand beeps.\nVery retro\nbut not all\nthat good\nreally.\nGreat\nGameplay:\nBeing recognisable characters\nwith moves that match takes\nthe sting out of the fact that i otherwise it is standard 2D usual bits and pieces, individual fights, team fights and T team tag fights. Then there |\nare the special moves, both\ndocumented and undocumented, but\nonce again we run-up against the 2D beat-em-up wall again. Pretty much\neverything that has been done is being\ndone again - it is like expecting the next\nracing game to\nlook like a high\ndetailed pole position rather than\nthe polygon\npacked Gran\nTourismo 2.\nSex and Violence:\nViolence is pre-sent, though of\nthe cartoon and\n..... ,.\n^ no blood variety -nothing that your granny would complain about - though people dressing up\nin tight lycra and hitting each other hard\nis a little suspect if you ask me, and definitely something for the home rather\nthan the streets, and only with a consenting partner.\nWho will buy it:\nOK, of all the 2D beat-em-ups out at the\nmoment this has to be one of the bet-ter. If you really want one and you can't wait for Street fighter Alpha 3 - reviewed\nnext week - this would be the one. Good\nfor Spiderman fans who want to see\ncam my get beat badly (Kylie minogue\ntake that - You should be so lucky, bl at, loco mate on this smash). GaryS.\n\n"

With no-one you ever\nheard of in it? And it's not even based\non a sixties TV series? Oh dear. But, no\n- The Cube is actually a damn fine movie,\nbasing itself on (dare I say it) genuine\nsuspense, in tt i gue and slow, confusing\nrevelation (good sci-fi should be at least\na little confusing - if your average punter\ncan understand it then why doesn't it\nexist now?) The characters may be ridden with stereotype, and the dialogue\ndoesn't flow very well, but you should-n't let that get in the way of a clever and\ninventive concept and some very scary\nstatistics. Oh, and it's pretty gory into the\nbargain (the slicing and dicing of the first\nvictim is frighteningly engrossing).\nHome Fries\nSince her return from rehab. Drew Barrymore's work-rate has been impressive\n- with half-a dozen (by-and-large successful) movies a year, she's clearly trying to make up for lost time. This\nparticular effort may have gone straight\nto video, but it's surprisingly likeable\nnonetheless. Pitting waitress Barrymore\nagainst the sons of the married man\nwho she has become pregnant by, it's a bizarre mix of black and romantic comedy (the boys are intent on scaring their\nfather back into the arms of their\nmother, and whilst one son wants her\ndead, the other falls in love) which never\nquite works out which of the two it\nwants to be. Nonetheless, Barrymore's engaging as ever, and the movie ends\nup as easygoing fun in spite of itself.\nChildren or the\nCorn IV\nYep, it's time for yet another Stephen\nKing adaptation -1 mean, just how many\nbooks has the man written? More to the\npoint, how much has he earned? Oh well, ignore such petty squabbling and\nget down to the review...well, this latest\ninstallment of Children of the Corn is\nadequate if not exciting; It's weird, it's gory and it's got psycho Pagan American\nkids. In other words. It's exactly what\nyou'd expect from any horror franchise\nwhere Individual movies can only be\ndiscerned by their accompanying roman\nnumeral. Very eighties.\nDave\n\n"

    "content": "1 June 1999 Sport 23\nUnion women win battle of the bars\nThe atmosphere was buzzing with Southside and ICU supporters separated only\nby the holy turf on which we now stood\n- ready for Southside to kick off. Yes this\nwas the tie of the season between the\ntwo biggest rival clubs in the College, if\nnot Britain. They met at Hyde Park, the\nhome of South Kensington Football.\nJudging from the line-ups, we\nappeared stronger and the fans were the\nmore confident and boisterous, whereas\nthe Southside lot were notably quiet.\nSouthside had most of the play in the\nfirst minutes. Some frantic passing from\ntook them into the ICUnited defensive\nterritory. ICUnited got the ball into the\nlast third of the park when Mel cleared\nfrom defence after tackling a Southside\nplayer. The ball ended up at the feet of\nMarie who defeated two Southside\ndefenders to fire home - scoring her first\nImperial goal ever. Southside kicked off\nagain, Amy and Anna kept up the\ndefence well, and it wasn't long before\nMarie got the ball again, whacked the\nSouthside defence, spared them no\nmercy and ICUnited were 2-0 up.\nFor the third time, Southside kicked\noff but made progress into the United\nhalf. The kick came to nothing, goalie\nFlorence whacked the ball upfield and it\ncame to a goal kick for Southsidc. Marie\ncompleted her hattrick just before half\ntime when a long kick from Florence\nplaced the ball on the left wing. Cutting\ninside and turning goal wards, the captain\nran across goal, turned and placed the\nball neatly between two defenders and\npassed the reach of the goalie. \"Sit\ndown, if you're three nil up!\" screamed\nthe ICU supporters. Captain Marie\ndropped back to defend with Amy taking her place as striker and within 3 minutes Flo had passed clear to Amy who\ntook a few touches before firing in a fantastic shot. ICUnited 4, Southside 0. So\nfar so good, and the whistle blew for\nhalf-time.\nSuper-sub Jess replaced Amy at half\ntime and ICUnited kicked off to find that\nthe referee had dropped the second\nhalf to 15 minutes at the request of the\nSouthside players. He also seemed to\nhave taken pity on them when they\nstarted receiving free kicks and throws\nfor no apparent reason. The game went\non regardless and it all changed as\nUnited conceded a free kick near their\ngoal area. Amish mash of ICUnited\nplayers formed half hearted wall which\nparted to let the free kick through. Florence went mad as Marie tried to explain\nthat if the Berlin wall could fall, we had\na valid excuse for this one crumbling to\npieces.\nSouthside started off with \"You're\nnot singing any more\" and chants of\n\"We're going to win 5-4\" when Marie\ntook the kick-off, charged into the Southside defence and put another one in the\nback of the net to take her tally to 4 and\nthe score back to a respectable 5-1. At\nthat point United fans went mad and\nSouthside went quiet once more. The\nlast remaining minutes saw Marie take\na free kick from 30 yards out which the\nkeeper saved.

    "content": "1 June 1999 Opinion\nWhat would Legalisation Lead to?\nIn the second of our two part exploration of the attitudes surrounding the legal is ation of drugs, Felix looks at the arguments in\nfavour of de-re gul atl on. Danny Kushllck, a spokesman for Transform - a pressure group which believes that current British drug\nlaws should be re-examined - answers questions on the benefits and problems of legal is ation. Q: Will direct action such as the mayday march help legal is e cannabis?\nA: I don't know whether rallies like\nthis actually change anything in themselves and we are deluding ourselves if\nwe think that they do. However, as part\nof a larger plan, it plays its part.\nCannabis will be legal is ed when\nthe crisis caused by its prohibition combined becomes too great for Government to bear - financially and in terms\nof public opinion. And also when\nthe government feels\nsafe enough to put it\nproperly on the political agenda.\nOur job as drug\nlaw reformers is to\nraise the issue on\nthat agenda. Our activities range from standing\nin elections on the single\nissue of legal is ation, speaking to local and\nnational policy makers, direct\naction like smokey bears picnics,\nproducing policy documents, getting\nmedia coverage, starting student\ngroups etc.\nTransform is part of a larger alliance\nto change policy and legislation in the\nUK. Or work falls into three main areas:\nPolicy, Membership and Media. We are\ninvolved in policy making forums at a local and national level. We have an\nactive membership who involve themselves in activities from writing to their\nMP to putting on debates and parties.\nWe have three active student groups\none of which is an official student society affiliated to the NUS.\nQ: How do events such as the mayday march fit In with Transform's policy\nof re-examining the legal status of all\nIllegal drugs?\nA: Cannabis prohibition Is one part\nof the problem. It is an important fight\nto repeal this bullshit law. I received a letter this morning from a50 year old\nguy who's serving 9 months in a Welsh\nprison for growing his own to alleviate\nback pain. Eric Mann is also serving a year for growing his own for arthritis.\nHe's50 odd too. It's positively bar-bari c. However, the consequences of the\nprohibition of heroin and crack are far\nworse. At least half of all property crime\nis related to fund ral sing to support a habit. It is purely because of the prohibition of these drugs that the price is\nso high and consequently addicts have\nto steal to support it. Most of the\nMafia's profits accrue from illegal drug\nsales. The market belongs to them. It\ncosts the UK 6 billion pounds\na year dealing with the fall-V out from prohibition. The\nIllegal trade in the UK is\nworth 19 billion a year.\nMany of our inner city\nareas are being decimated\nby street dealers\nand violence, dirty\nneedles and acquisitive crime. Intravenous drug users\nthemselves are\nscapegoated and\nsuffer the health consequences of prohibition.\nIncreased HIV and Hepatitis\ntransmission, death from\npure heroin (ten in Bristol\nin the last 2 months, six In Norfolk) etc etc. As far as we are concerned it is anti-prohibition is m which is\nthe important Issue rather than the specific issue of cannabis. And by addressing drug policy as a whole we can begin\nto see the underlying issues involved in\ncreating progressive change.\nQ: What Is your response to the\noften heard criticism \"It's all very well to\nlegal is e some relatively harmless drugs,\nsuch as cannabis, but these Inevitably\nlead on to harder and more addictive\ndrugs, which have serious and undesirable social problems associated with\nthem\"?\nA: We are absolutely clear that it is\nso-called dangerous drugs which need\nto be legal is ed. It is absolutely madness\nto leave the dangerous drugs In the\nhands of an unregulated uncontrolled\nmarketplace. We have a choice here:\nWe have four methods of distributing\ndrugs -1 Over the counter eg. aspirin,\n2 Licensed outlets eg. alcohol 3 Prescriptions eg. prozac, or 4 The criminal market. The choice is ours. We\nknow that there are 200-300 thousand\nheroin addicts in the UK. Do we want\nthem to buy their drugs from International cartels or from doctors. Would\nwe want alcohol and tobacco sold\nexclusively through the criminal market?\nIf we were to ban them we'd increase\nthe price massively, lower the quality\nand have a massive increase in property\ncrime associated with feeding a tobacco habit. And let's not be deluded\nby the language of the government.\nAlcohol and tobacco are very dangerous drugs. How come we're so concerned about the gateway myth of\ncannabis leading to 'harder' drugs,\nwhen the gateway drugs that we all\nstart using first are the very dangerous\nones of alcohol and tobacco. Tobacco\nkills 300 each every day, alcohol 100\neach and every day, heroin 3 each and\nevery day. Interestingly most of the\nheroin deaths are to do\nwith ignorance of the strength of\nwhat they were using. A problem that\nwould be solved by legal ising. Heroin\nis a relatively safe drug compared with\nalcohol and tobacco. And let's not forget that cannabis is not harmless. It is\ngenerally smoked and smoking causes\ndisease. Remember Bob Marley died of\nlung cancer.\nThe serious and undesirable social\nproblems associated with heroin, crack\nand speed are in the main created and\ndefinitely exacerbated by their illegality.\nThe issue is to create a policy around\ndrug use and misuse that first and foremost reduces harm and reduces costs.\nProhibition does not do that and legal-is ation does. It's that simple. Legalisation is not a cure-all however. People\nwill still get ill and die as they do with\nalcohol and tobacco. But we could\nreduce the crime associated with mis-use, raise revenue, stop stigma ti sing addicts, give out better information,\nrestore civil rights, empty our prisons\nand ultimately begin to address the\nunderlying problems drug misuse,\nnamely poverty and lack of opportunity. The Arts Appreciation Society\nwishes to thank all of its 283\nmembers for their continued\nsupport over the last year.\nSome of the shows for which\nwe intend to arrange, tickets\nduring the coming year include:\nChicago * The Lion King\nWest Side Story * Rent\nSaturday Night Fever * Cats\n...plus loads more, including other\nmusicals, opera, ballet an<I, ir c vh ihi ii or is$0 y ARTS OC Imperial College Union Arts Appreciation Society\nFor further information, please e mail a\".o<( \u00ab,ic ac uk\n\n"

Showing uncharacteristic\ndisloyalty to the cause, I was gleefully\ncounting down the days until I could\nconfidently announce that the trees\nhad gone to the great arboretum in\nthe sky. then a leaf appeared. I was . >'.f|| \u00a7\nshocked. Immediately I suspected foul\nplay and began to look for signs of a bit\nof handiwork with some foliage and\nAraldite. Now the bloody things are\ncovered in leaves and- this really hurts-are starting to look like proper trees.\nDamn you, Ian Caldwell! In the words\nof old man Jennings, the fairground\nowner, I'd have gotten away with it if\nit wasn't for those pesky Estates senior\nmanagers.\nThe Battle of Orgreave it wasn't. The AUT strike was a bit of a damp\ns qui b, with precious little evidence of\nany real disruption, at least as far as I could tell. As you know, I'm not usually\nthe first one on the barricades hoisting\nthe red flag aloft, but I have some sympathy with this cause, if not the actions\ntaken. Calling a strike during an exam\nperiod is questionable, but for the\nImperial AUT president, Laura Barker, to\nsay that 'she will stand behind students\nwho skip exams' Is grossly irresponsible, be to scrap national pay scales. A relic\nI suspect that using secondary industrial from the sixties and seventies, it is\naction as an excuse ut patently ridiculous\nfor not attending an \"...in the words of old that academics at\nexam would get Imperial and De\nshort shrift from man Jennings, I'd Montfort on the\nboth the College and same grade are paid\nSenate House.

Universities\nindustry are settling should be free to set\nfor the same or less. But that is not to their own salaries, rewarding people\nsay lecturers do not deserve more. They commensurate with their standing. Secondly, the last vestiges of tenure should\nbe swept away. The idea of a job for life\nis unacceptable these\ndays, serving only as an\nalmost insurmountable\nbarrier to sacking\nincompetent academics. If people are\ngood, they have nothing to fear from such a measure as their abilities will secure their\nlong term prospects.\nThat is not to say that\none should fear as\ninstrument of personnel policy. Shortterm contracts are less than helpful,\n\"...this strike was\nnot helpful, but\nnot as unhelpful as\na pledge of support\nfrom the NUS\npresident...\"\nBaker\nVoice of Reason\nbut have appeared in part as a consequence of the risk of giving tenure,\njust in case the person concerned turns\nout to be a disappointment. If we had\nthe same employment regime as the\nreal world, good people would stay and\nprosper, while the wasters would be\nshown the door. Finally, performance-related pay should be introduced. It is\npainfully simple to assess the performance of academics by a combination\nof publication records and existing\nappraisal methods. If somebody hasn't published in years and is universally\nperceived to be a crap lecturer, why\nshould they be entitled to an automatic\npay rise? Publications on their own\nrarely succeed in quantifying the contribution of a lecturer, since many do\nmore than their\nfair share of teach-ing, and do it\nextremely well.\nTaking both\ntogether, the setting of bonuses\ncould be achieved\nsimply, cheaply\nand, most importantly, fairly. I have\nalways believed\nthat it is deeply\nunfair that lecturers are paid so little\ngiven their qualifications and the time\ntaken to achieve them. They should\nreceive more, but I fear that this pet u lant, outmoded approach will win them\nfew concessions. Despite their assur-ances, students are bound to be\naffected by strike action. If they wanted\nto focus the attack on the university\nauthorities, they should direct their\nmembers to refuse to comply with their\nnon-academic, administrative duties.\nCome to think of it, if you managed to\nbring Sherfield to a halt, after a week\nthe College would have saved enough\nmoney to quadruple your salaries. This\nstrike was not helpful, but not as\nunhelpful as a pledge of support from\nthe NUS president. Frankly, with friends\nlike Andrew 'ooh Tony, you're such a wonderful man, please will you give\nme a safe seat when I 've finished\ndestroying the reputation of the NUS'\nPakes, who needs enemies?\nI was going to give my two 'pen-ne th on the Ericcson PFI bid to run the\nphones and suchlike, but space has\nbeaten me again. More about that next\ntime probably, but now for something\ncompletely different. I'm going to say\nsomething nice about College Catering.\nHonestly, not a wind-up, I assure you.\nA couple of weeks ago, I attended a combined '22/Links/Chaps Clubs dinner in the SCR. For those of you not\nfamiliar, these are the three elective\nsocial clubs of Imperial, dismissed by\ncertain senior College members as little more than a collection of pissed up\nlouts, despite counting the Deputy Rector among their number, which provide the backbone of alumni relations.\nAnyway, the point is that the food was\ngood. No that's not right- it was excel-lent, the best meal I have ever eaten at\nIC. Normally in such situations, there is\ntendency for the beef to be over-cooked, but this was knocking on the\ndoor of perfection. All in all, a superb\nthree courses, served and presented\nvery well. My old sparring partner John\nFoster, Head of Catering, should congratulate all his staff for performing at\ntheir very best to deliver a brilliant\nevening. Christ, if you can please me,\nthe sky's the limit, John.\n\n"

Hopefully this won't offend any fundamentalist Christians, but\nI really don't like Bible quotes being used\nto sum up or defend a position. Why?\nBecause you can find averse in the Bible\nto defend pretty much anything. If anyone\nhas a good argument against this, which\nwon't lead to a protracted exchange of\nbiblical references, my ears are open.\nAnd while I'm at it, I have to disagree\nwith your portrayal of my former depart-ment's staff.

Earlier on this\nyear, as I'm sure many of you remember,\nI was forced to apologise in tail-between-the-legs Sun-like style for printing the infamous comic strip. Well, last Thursday I discovered a copy of the C& GU Songsheet for the 1997 Fresher's Barnight in the\nFelix Office. It had the usual Guilds' songs,\nincluding 'The Engineers Song', which\ncontains such beautiful lyrics as \"she was\nsplit from arse to tit, and the whole fucking Issue was covered in shit\" and the\n(in?)famous 'Mayor of Bayswater's Daughter'; \"She went to Glamorgan, her cunt like\na barrel organ\".\nIf some individual paid for the\nphotocopying etc then I can't really\ncomplain. If, however, it came out of\nC& GU funds... well, I'd be surprised if\nevery Guildsman, and particularly\nGuildswoman, thinks that is a good way\nto spend public money. This little pedantic ramble doesn't really have a conclusion,\nbut I would be interested to hear any\nopinions on the subject. Can\nlanguage be as offensive as visual\nportrayals? Suppose 50% of C& GU members attended and enjoyed that bar night does that justify the song sheet? What if\nit was 20%? 10%?

    "content": "12\nAlbums\nMusic\nLES RHYTHMES DIGITALES\nDarkdancer\n1 June 1999\nMEDAL\nDrop Your Weapon\nAnd will an A# work here? Lovely.\nW ith all the hype that followed\nFrance winning the World Cup\nlast summer you might have\nthought that the people of Britain\nwould have had enough of their closest\nneighbours. Flowever, as well, as\nFrench managers and players still doing\nwell in the English premiership, it seems\nas if 1999 is going to be another successful year for French music in our\nmusic charts.\nThe French music explosion began\nin 1997 with the emergence of Daft\nPunk's wondrous Homework album,\nwhich was heralded by many as the\nalbum of the year. This was followed in\n1998 with a similar feat by Air with Moon\nSafari. Then in summer 1998, as if the\nfootball wasn't enough, the British public choose the French Music Sounds Better With You by Stardust for their main\nsummer anthem. When 1999 came\nalong, one might have thought it was\ntime for the Brit-boys to hit back, but the\nFrench dominance has continued with\nCassius's fabulous 1999, and now we've\ngot the equally excellent Darkdancer by\nLes Rythmes Digitales.\nWith Darkdancer, Les Rythmes Digitales follow the pattern set by their fellow countrymen and the style is thus a blend of pop, cheese, electro-80s and\nthe crucial touch of Frenchness. However, the similarity by no way takes the\nedge or originality away from the music.\nThe sounds are different enough to be\nrefreshing, but similar enough to retain\nthat je ne sais quoi.\nIt starts off as it means to go on\nwith instant head-bobbing funk, and simple vocals that will have the listener\nsinging along almost as quickly. The\ntunes follow similar patterns and the\nnon-complex structure only adds to the\nappeal. There's also a number of guest\nvocalists present on the album. Perhaps\nthe most interesting being Nik Kershaw,\nwho gave us the unforgettable Wouldn't It Be Good in the 1980s. Kershaw's vocals\nare present on Sometimes, which\nalthough not as bad as the song with the\nsame name by Erasure, is not the best\ntrack on the album. Nevertheless, guesting on a tack by a credible dance act is\nmore forgivable for an '80s rock star\nthan trying to revive your flagging career\nby landing a part in Eastenders.\nSo all in all those French boys have\ndone it again. Darkdancer is cheesy at\ntimes, and it doesn't break any barriers\nwhen it comes to music making, but it's funky, it's groovy and I suppose above all\nIt's got that Frenchness. BI James\nMAN OR ASTROMAN\nEeviac\n*\u2022\nI your television?\nW hat can I say? This is weird,\nseriously weird. Obsessed\nwith all that is vaguely futuristic and scientific, Man or Astroman\nhave endeavour ed to create the mother of all 'space rock' albums and failed\nmiserably. This is so bad, so unbelievably boring that I am lost for words.\nSo here's the background; They are\na trio from Alabama who go by the\nnames of Birdstuff, Coco and Star Crunch\nand I would describe their 'astro style' of\nguitar playing as being not dissimilar to\nyour average 'boy along the corridor'\ndesperately attempting the opening\nchords of Beetlebum for the 5th time at\nmaximum volume and still getting it\nwrong.\nThe album is childishly simple in its\nstructure. Each track opens with some\nrandom sample from a sci-fi film, the guitars play fast and hard and sometimes,\nif you're lucky, you might hear someone\nsing. All in all, the appalling guitar playing and screamed lyrics interjected with\nsamples of old men talking about futuristic type things make for a pretty unique\nlistening experience which I'm sure\nsome people could learn to appreciate.\nThe surf and skate kids love 'em because\nthey're so crazy. They have been known\nto set fire to their heads on stage..How\ncool is that?! Having s lagged them off so\nruthlessly I feel I must send at least one\nfairly positive comment their way; The\naforementioned samples scattered\nthroughout the album ate quite funny\nand provide a much needed source of\nentertainment that makes the guitar\nplaying just about bearable. Overall, the\nmost noticeable thing that hits you about\nthis album is aptly put in the very first\nwords you hear on pressing the play\nbutton. 'It's the same old series of signals\nover and over again' says the distinctively\nfuturistic sounding man in the opening\nsample of Interstellar Hardrive.\nPut over some wacky surfing film or\nas the music for a computer game, these\n13 tracks would sound brilliant. But without the pictures that should accompany\nthe sound, listening to this is like torture.\nIn conclusion all I can say is give me\nsci-fi geeks, give me futuristic lingo that\nI don't understand, give me anything but\nthis.

    "content": "24 Sport & Crossword 1 June 1999\nCRICKET-1st XI\nImperial cruise into Semis\nby Gus Paul\nThe IC 1st XI cruised into the semi finals\nof the ULU Cup with a crushing 128 run\nvictory over LSE last Wednesday. On a sunny afternoon at Harlington, IC, put\ninto bat by LSE, racked up an impressive\n229 for 7.\nTop scores from Jawwad Rasheed\n(69), who again dominated the bowling\nbefore being forced to retire with a knee\ninjury, and keeper John Williams (48)\ngave IC a good total to bowl at. LSE did-n't help themselves by dropping 5\ncatches, and IC scored 80 runs in the last\nTO overs, Nick Holt with a particularly\naggressive 24 off 13 balls, despite one of\nthe LSE bowlers taking 3 wickets in 4\nballs.\nLSE had trouble with the Imperial\nopening attack and both openers\nscratched around before Murali (2-20)\ngot them out. The middle order were\nkept tied down to 3 runs an over, but\nAdam Uttley (2-7) and Jawwad (3-19),\ncapping a great all round performance,\nrushed the rest of the team out cheaply\nand tSE were all out for 101. IC looked\nquite comfortable against some bowling\nthat, with a couple of exceptions, was\nfairly ordinary, and some athletic fielding,\nparticularly by Jon Ainsworth on the\nboundary, underlined ICs superiority.\nThe firsts can now look forward to an\naway semi-final against either last year's finalists Royal Holloway, or a rematch\nfrom the group stages against Bart's. The seconds, meanwhile completed\ntheir season a couple of weeks ago with\na victory over Kings 1st XI. The depth of\nthe squad is show by the fact that they\nhave last year's first team captain\namongst their ranks. The win, believed\nto be the first time the IC 2nds has\nbeaten a firsts team, was enough to\nknock a powerful King's team out of the\ncompetition.\nIC 229/7 (Rasheed 69) v LSE 101 (Rasheed 3-19)\nIC won by 128 runs\nScorecard inside on page 23\nFOOTBALL\nSouthside thump Union in football\nOn a sunny afternoon of Sunday 23rd May, Southside and Union armies met at\nHyde Park ready for this mouth-watering\nbattle.\nA slightly less serious girls match kicked\noff first, which was pretty much dominated\nby the Union and their star player Marie.\nThe Union won 5-1, but Helen grabbed a consolation for Southside, blasting home\na free-kick from all of about twenty yards\nwhich would surely have broken the net\nhad there been one. This was a great spec-tac le, rounded off by the players exchanging shirts after the final whistle.\nNext came the main event, the men\ntook to the field. Early indications were that\nthis was going to be a rough and tough\naffair, as Southside's Craig had to retire\nfrom the game after just one minute with\na knock on the nose - I thought you were\nfrom the North East son? Also, seconds\nafter this a soft Union geezer went down\nafter receiving a knee to the testicles, much\nto the Southside supporters delight. 'Ref\nhad to blow his whistle for fouls many\nmore times.\nThe deadlock was broken when Southside gained a free-kick about thirty yards\nout. Super Nick ran up and curled a fine\nshot into the top left corner, sending players and fans alike wild. Despite Southside\ndefending like lions, one instance of slack\nmarking allowed the Union to equalise.\nHowever, they bounced back superbly\nwhen Warren rose to head in - this was the\nman who had won the fe ague this season\nwith the IC 1 st team finishing as top scorer\nand who scored a hat-trick in the famous\ncup final victory.\nSo at halftime Southside were leading\n2-1. The second was similar to the first -fast, furious and dirty. The union squandered opportunities to score and so did\nWarren who played poorly. However, the\nmatch was wrapped up well and truly\nwhen Southside's sweeper Soso added a third with only a few minutes remaining.\nWhen 'Ref blew his whistle for full-time it\nwas shear carnage, and the celebration\nwere to continue well into the evening\nback at THE bar - that's Southside Bar.\nThe Union won a boat race drinking contest but I'm sure they must have cheated\nsomehow!\nLast week's crossword was won by Will Dugdale.

The chorus is incredibly\ncatchy, irritatingly so (in a good way)\nand there are some smashing har-monies. All this is backed up with a breezy riff and thumping beats. Get up\nand dance!\nGay Dad - Joyl\nIt's difficult to pin down what's so good\nabout these lot because there are so\nmany faces to the music. They've got that\n70s Glam thing going on but with such\na contemporary 90s sound. Joy! has a dark, mysterious verse and a totally juxtaposed chorus that work well together.\nAll Gay Dad need now is a real break into\nthe mainstream.\nIAm Seven - Welcome\nA lot of the offerings this week sound\nquite similar, like these, Trashmonk and\nLiberty 37. IAm Seven do have a little\nmore to offer than Liberty 37 in that the\nsingle's a smidgen more poppy and will\nmost definitely appeal to a wider audi-en ce. There's a hint of Ash (God forbid)\nin the vocals and a punk style riff that, all\nin all make for an enjoyable track. The\nother tracks on this are of a high standard\ntoo.\nLiberty 37 - Oh River\nA British version of the Deftones? Not\nquite. Liberty 37 are certainly loud and\nhave their hearts set on being the\nDeftones but with those lyrics and vocals\nthe note they hit is more along the lines\nof Silverchair. The b sides were In the\nsame vein too. They can have a point for\nmaking me giggle at the line mice\nhave eaten all the strings.'\nThe Moffatts - Until You Love Me\nIf ever there was a reason microwaves\nwere invented, this is it. Full power for a couple of seconds was all it needed to\nkill the offending kids' noise and create\npretty blue lightning to bring happiness\nto all. Just think Hanson but with less originality and the inability to write their own\nsongs. Spare us.\nRuby Cruiser - (Wow, How Cool Is) Joe's New Car\nAnd Crap Song Title Of The Week goes\nto Ruby Cruiser. It's not a bad song but\nthe whole sound is that of a bunch of\nmates messing about in a garage and\nnot being too bothered about who's lis-ten ing. Having cars (and explaining them\nin minute detail), buying drugs and ageing hippies do not a good song make.\nRemy Zero - Cramarye\nThis is a bit of an arty one, this. Gramarye\ngets a touch dreary in places but the\noverall feel is a melancholy one. I got the\nimage of an 80s rock star from the\nsinger's voice but maybe that's just something wrong with me. The second track's less mental hospital and more a walk in\nthe park. Talented.\nTrashmonk - Polygamy\nDo you remember Terence Trent D 'Arby?\nWell, the lead singer has a sound of old\nTerence about him, which is un for tu nate. Apart from this sad fact Polygamy\nisn't that bad, in fact I rather like it. It's one of those songs that makes you feel\nlike you're being watched: it's creepy. I got pissed off by the third version,\nthough. H Christian\nBeastie Boys - Remote Control / 3 MCs\nand! DJ\nAhh, the boys at their best. Missing the\nusual superb lyrics and some insane DJ\nskills from Mix Master Mike. There are\ntwo versions of this single - try to get the\nsecond with the added bonus of a live\nvideo rendition of 3MCs and One DJ.\nAnother classic from the Grand Royal\nvault.\nFridge - Klnsoshlta Terasaka\nIf you like lyrics don't buy this single, cos\nit ain't got any. They would get in the way\nanyway. This is a lovely piece of chilled\nout beats and keyboard. Ahhhh.\nLovecraft - Fun With Flashlights\nThis indie-ish slow number ambles along\np least an ly enough. The Bs dies rock out\na bit more - sounding more and more\nRadiohead-like as they progress. The\nsinger starts to sound worrying ly Bowieish at some points. He wants to watch\nthat.\nSuper Collider - It Can't Be Long\nSounds a bit ketamine influence, this\none. Very drugged out and as a result It\nfeels like the tune is dragging its feet at\ntimes. The midfield general remix is\nmuch more correctly paced and the big\nbeats really help it along.\nOne Lady Owner - Police Car Sex\nPredicatable, punk ish pointlessly distorted pap wh ci h tries to seal a couple\nmore copies by putting a sexy nurse on\nthe cover of the single. Works for me.\nGarbage - You Look So Fine\nIs it me or do all of the Garbage tracks\nhave exactly the same beat in the back-ground? It'll doubtless be very succes ff ul it's just not much of a change from pre-Symposium\nvio us efforts. The fun Loving Criminals\nremix on the other hand is just so much\nbetter. Lovely and twisted and dark. Buy\nit for the remix alone.\nErassy - Bonus Beats EP\nVery college rock with a bit of break-beats thrown into the mix. They rock out\nimpressively on one of the b sides while\nthe final track provides a bit of free beat-age for all you budding Fatboy Slims out\nthere. Like a chimp with a303 on bad\nacid. Nope, I don't understand that last\nsentence either.\nSystem of a Down - Sugar\nThrash metal punk from some tediously\nweird looking guys. Not very good at all.\nAnd the 'uncut' version doesn't have\nnearly enough swear words in it.\nToploader - Achlllles Heel\nJust a really good song. Takes elements\nof Robbie Williams, Neil Young and Soungarden - but much, much bigger than the\nsum of its parts. It's just epic on the\nscale of the Phantom Menace. Will be\nhuge if there is any justice.\nStroke - Internal Call\nVery Spiritualized. Very, very Spiritualized. First track sounds similar to a Sneaker Pimps (remember them?) song\nthat I can't quite remember the name of.\nPleasant enough to the eardrums but\naccompanied by an almost per men ant sense of deja-vu.\nSix by Seven - Two and a Half Days In\nLove With You\nBoth the title track and B sides get quite\nepic at times. They can talk the talk but\nI am not quite sure if they can walk the\nwalk. Have a listen first.\nNojahoda - Teach Me How to Fly\nAnnoyingly catchy. With the emphasis on\nannoying. I swear there Is a casio keyboard boss a nova beat in the back-ground. Suddenly goes from boss a nova,\nto sheer ROCK. Should have been rock\nall the way through in my opinion, features a mental video on the cd too -great.\nSymposium - Killing Position\nNrggggh. This is very much a balls out\nsong. Wicked riffs very much in evidence.\nStill not sure about the singer when he\nisn't belting it out at full volume. Otherwise no complaints. H Joel\n\n"

It\nwould not be an advantage to the majority of the population to have the drug\nlegal is ed. There are a few extra points I'd like to\nmake which support the law on cannabis\nas it stands.\nIt is impossible to test drivers to see if\nthey are under the influence of cannabis.\nThere was recently a trial for a test that\nturned out to be unreliable. Consider a young man or woman who has been\n\"pulling bongs\" for an evening can drive\nhome knowing that they can not be prosecuted for driving under the influence\nunless they admit to doing it. I think we'd all rather this person could not get away\nwith it so easily, for the sake of everyone's safety.\nCannabis users are shown to be more\nlikely to suffer from psychosis than non\nusers.\nThe fact that the de criminal is ation would be impossible to reverse if implemented. Current cannabis dealers are likely to\nmove onto dealing harder drugs, especially those who deal drugs for members\nof the criminal fraternity only because they\nare in debt to them and those in the dealing cycle (those who \"tick\" drugs to help\npay back debts).\nCannabis is currently \"almost freely\navailable\" and can be used and enjoyed by\npeople in their own home with virtually no\nchance of police interference and\nabsolutely no chance of a custodial sentence unless they are criminally active in\nsome other way.\nEdd Dixon\nDear Felix,\nThere was one thing in particular that\nsprang to mind after reading Andrew\nVivian's article on cannabis. The problem\nwith illegal substances isn't supply or the\npolice. It's the (fairly reasonable) attitude\ntaken by most employers and say, universities, that people who take cannabis are\ncriminals and should therefore be pun-is he d,f he threats of unemployment,\nhomelessness and expulsion are very real,\nbut would fade if cannabis were to be\nde criminal is ed. When was the last time\nyou heard of anyone being kicked out of\nHalls for having a beer?\nOh yeah, before I forget: the Net does-n't create porn, terrorism or whatever, it just\nmakes it a little easier to find. A copy of Razzle probably costs less than the time you'd spend downloading a couple of images,\nand all you need to make bombs is a small\namount of chemical knowledge and a lot\nof care. Having said that, the Net will\nprobably need some kind of regulation\nsoon be fot e it collapses from over-use\nanyway...\nLet's see, if I sell my entire stash, I can\nalmost afford a Summer Ball ticket.\nAnon\nGM Food Lacks Research\nDear felix,\nI read with interest the views of one SW\nCooper in his recent letter to Felix (24th May\n1999). I am glad he was disturbed by the\nlaminated sign on which the guarantee of\nGM free food was not possible. Unfortunately he then went on to heap praise on\nit because IC is a 'veritable centre for\ngenetic research'. This is precisely the reason why so many people in Britain are not\ntoo keen on the idea of transgenic food -lack of research. Much of the research\ndone on the effects of GM food is done\nby the companies who patented the novel\nplant in the first place. In a largely unregulated industry, most guidelines are vol-unt ary, and it seems to many that te search is kept to a minimum so that the company\ncan recoup its outlay as soon as possible.\nMany claims made by companies such as\nMonsanto are along the lines of \"feeding\nthe world,\" \"lowering costs,\" and \"lowering\nherbicide use\". Yet we currently overproduce food to the tune of one third, and it\nis due to unfair economic distribution that\nthere are starving people in the world.\nPharmaceuticals are subject to very\nrigorous testing before they are released\nonto the market, delaying the release for\nan average of about 12 years. This is to prevent disasters such as the thalidomide case\nrecurring. Drugs, in any case, can always be\nrecalled should any effect prove un de sir able. However, a rogue gene can never be\n'recalled' and instead will proliferate very\nquickly once in the environment, so effects\nnot seen now could appear in the future,\nwith nothing we could do to stop it. There\nare also other ethical issues - to what extent\nis it acceptable to patent the food chain,\neffectively giving monopolies to those\npatent holders, and does the continued\ndesire to make agriculture as mono cultural as possible have any positive effects\non biodiversity, and wildlife in general? Do\nconsumers have the right to choose not to\neat GM food?\nThe scientific community is by no\nmeans united in its views on the technology, as can be seen by the recent press\nrelease by the BMA and while I can see that\nbiotechnology could have many positive\neffects in the fields of medicine and pharmacology, it seems to me that the lunatic\nrelease of GM organisms into the environment is possibly one of the biggest\nerrors we could make. I would like to finish with a quote from the report the BMA\npublished (probably not 'sound scientific\nminds' here but never mind):\n'..We recommend a moratorium on\nthe commercial planting of GM crops in the\nUK. The moratorium should continue until\nthere is scientific consensus (or as close\nagreement as reasonably achievable)\nabout the potential long-term environmental effects'.\nThomas N.D. Tibbits\nLecturers v Students\nDear Felix\nContrary to the advice in Felix, I did not elect\nto show solidarity for my lecturers on Tuesday. Several friends who took the occasion\nas an opportunity to have a lie in asked me\nwhy not:\n1) I do not know of one lecturer who\nshowed any solidarity to their students\nover the tuition fees issue.\n2) Several of my lecturers have made\nit crystal clear that teaching undergrads is\na chore and that we are an annoying hindrance to their research work.\n3) Having sat in a pub and overheard\nme ch eng lecturers deride the (perceived?)\npersonal and academic inadequacies of\ntheir students, I wondered exactly why I should bother supporting people who feel\nso much contempt for me and my fellow\nstudents.\n4) Exactly how much do lecturers earn\nfrom consultancies?\nThe phrase Give and gifts will be given\nto you, for whatever measure you deal out\nto others will be dealt to you in return' (Luke\n6:38 & The Beach) comes to mind...\n2nd yr bio undergrad\nThe phrase \"Why do you look at the speck\nof sawdust In your brother's eye and pay\nno attention to the plank in your own eye?'\n(Luke 6:41) comes to mind...\nSummer Ball Update\nDear fellow students,\nThree times more rides, including an indoor\nBig Wheel, Classic Horse Carousel and\nDodgems. Twenty-four coaches instead of\neight to get you there and back. \u00a315,000\nspent on production, compared with only\n\u00a35,000 These are just three improvements\nthe 1999 Summer Ball has on last year's ball.\nTickets were selling at 25/hour last\nweek and are only on sale for another 5\ndays. Monday the 7th June is the closing\ndate, but don't be the one to leave it to the\nlast minute only to miss out, buy your\nticket today. Congratulations to Nalini Balakumaran (Biochemistry III) and Josh Lawson (Physics I) who have both not only won\ntheir money back from having got their tickets early, but will also enter this week's and\nevery subsequent week's draw for more\nprizes.

In all countries the state also\nasserts this right.

These\nsites are useful resources for anyone interested in this issue.\nFor content labelling to be effective it\nIs essential that publishers label their con-tent. It is particularly important that inoffensive content is labelled as such else\nchildren may be blocked from reading it.\nMany readers will have the opportunity to\ninfluence this in their professional lives\nand I urge them to do so.\nJames Bayley\n(Web Solutions Manager)\nDeadline for letters for\nis 12noon Wednesday.\nLetters may be edited for length, but\nwill not be altered in any other way.\nLetters need not be signed, but a swipe card must be shown when submitting anonymous letters.\n\n"

    "content": "1\nJune\n1999\nKEEP THE CAT FREE EST 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College Students Show Little Interest in Strike\nThe Association of University Teachers'\none-day strike, which took place at\ncolleges across the country last Tuesday (25 May), has been described as\na success by its organisers. The effectiveness of the strike here at Imperial\nis more questionable however, as is\nthe overall outcome of the industrial\naction.\nServices within college were undeniably affected, with the central library\nclosing earlier than usual and many\ndepartments going without key academic personnel for the day. According\nto Ms Laura Barker, AUT representative\nat the college, the AUT \"mounted an\neffective picket\": On the ground, how-ever, there was relatively little sign of\nthe strike, and most campus entrances\nwere left un picketed throughout much\nof the day.\nAccording to the Registry all examinations scheduled for last Tuesday\nwent ahead as planned. As Felix went\nto press it was unclear whether any\nstudents had skipped exams, but it\nseems unlikely, suggesting widespread student apathy towards the\nstrike. Ms Barker commented \"stu-dents ranged from those fully supportive and joining us on the picket\nline to those who had little information\nThe 'fat cat' Vice-chancellor on show at Imperial last Tuesday\nPhoto: Ed\nor interest in the issue.\" She described\nmost students as \"sympathetic but\nunderstandably concerned with their\nown affairs\".\nAUT action was more successful\nelsewhere in London, with pickets and\nrallies generating much press inter-est. Outside London a series of pickets and rallies ensured that the AUT\ngot its message across. Although student support was mostly confined to\nNUS representation, students at\nAberdeen handed out stickers in\nexamination halls and joined in AUT\nrallies. At most universities exams went\nahead, using non-AUT staff to Invigilate, but at many campuses it was far\nharder to organise them than at Imperial. According to AUT sources Liverpool University was practically closed.\nClayponds Approved\nClayponds is at last to be built a Village hall', after years of discussion\nand campaigning. The decision was\nfinalised at the Rector's Committee\non Student Residences, held last\nweek, and should result in a new\nsocial area for the hall, which is situated in South Ealing, opening in\nabout a year's time.\nDetails of the plans for building\nthe social area were still vague as\nFelix went to press, with neither college nor ICU sources being able to\nconfirm exactly how the project will\nbe funded. It has been suggested that an upper limit of \u00a3120,000 is rea-By Ed Sexton\nson able for the project, but it could\ncost considerably less. Some money\nwill almost certainly be provided by\nthe IC Trust, with the rest being generated from increased rents: It seems\nlikely that residents of Clayponds will\nsee their weekly bill increase by\nabout \u00a31.20 a week for the next five\nyears. Although many have suggested it is a dangerous precedent to\nfund hall projects by increasing rents,\na survey of Clayponds residents\nrevealed that 8 0 % of them would be\nprepared to pay Ihe ex lr a rent in\norder to get the hall built.\nIf the project goes according to\nplan, the new building should be finished sometime next Spring Term,\nand possibly even by the end of 1999.\nDavid Hellard, ICU President, was ve ty pleased with the decision, but added\na cautionary warning on Ihe subject\nof increased rents; \"presumably the\nrents will drop back down after five\nyears.\"\nDr Mark Tyrer, warden of Clayponds, was unfortunately unavailable\nfor comment at the time of going to\nprint.\nAlthough there was strong support from the NUS, support from individual student unions was less\nforthcoming. Leeds Student Union did\nactively support the strike, but ICU\nwas less than vocal on the subject.\nDavid Hellard, ICU President, hoped\nthat students had taken his advice and\ncome in to college if they had exam i nations, but vowed to fight college if\nany students had been penal is ed for\nmissing them. Ms Barker stated \"we\navoided putting any pressure on students who reported that they were\ngoing in for exams\".\nAll AUT members who were on\nstrike are supposed to have pay\ndeducted: The University and Colleges\nEmployers Association issued instructions that the amoun t deducted\nshould be 1 /260th of the striker's pay.\nMost institutions, including Imperial,\nhave accepted the AUT's proposal that\nthe amount deducted be 1/365th of\nthe striker's pay. Pay deducted from\nstaff should be given to the university's hardship funds, but it was unclear at\nthe time of going to print whether or\nnot Imperial would take up this idea.\nFurther industrial action may be in the\npipeline for later this month and next\nyear.\nInside..m L6tt6rS - Drugs & Porn 4\nEditorial - Ed fills space 5\nColumns- Voice of Reason 6\nScience - Herbal Remedies 8\nOpinion - Cannabis II 9\nFeature - Ghana 10\nCompetition-Railcard 11\nReVieWS -The usual lot 12\nSport - Clash of the Bars 23\nCrOSSWOrd -by Sheep24 "

    "content": "1 June 1999\nAlbums\nBASEMENT JAXX\nMusic 13\nH mmm. Methinks I have found\nthe sound of the summer here.\nBut first of all, who are the Jaxx?\nSimon Ratcliffe and Felix Buxton take\nresponsibility for this album. They hail\nfrom Camberwell and hold degrees in\nengineering and languages. So they\naren't just a pair of brainless monkeys\nwho fluke d out a wicked album by random button pressing.\nThe best thing about this album is\nthat it doesn't take Itself too seriously.\nThere has been a worrying trend recently\nof a lot of tunes that may have some\ngreat technical features, and are very\nnice to listen too but don't get you dan c ing. Which is what dance music is all\nabout after all. It's practically impossible\nto listen to this album and not at least\nswing some body part in time to the\nmusic (ooh-err miss us). Seriously though\nthis maybe the best dance album of the\nyear - until the Chemicals present their\neffort at least - and it's going to be pretty\nhard to beat this one.\nThe first single off the album Is the\nrather funky Red Alert, it's the one with\nthe great quote 'ain't nothin' goin' on\nbut history' that is being relentlessly overplayed on Radio 1 right now. The really\ngreat thing about this tune is that it\nblends so many different styles and\nvoices that it always surprises you with a little something that you hadn't noticed\nbefore.\nAnother bunch which will be sure to\nget you grooving are Bingo Bango, YoYo and Jump n' Shout. How can a track\ncalled Bingo Bango possibly not be fan-tast i c?I'm not sure about that, but this\none certainly hits the spot. It goes crazy\nwith relentless Latin rhythms, calms it\ndown with a nice bit of pl inky plo nky and\nthen brings it all home with that whole\ncarnival atmosphere -1 defy you not to\nsamba. Yo-yo has what I would describe\nas a crunching bass line, tis ten and you\nwill understand. Drugged out lyrics also\nfeature heavily - 'You were a prophet\nfrom above, then you came and sucked\nmy butt, my pain became my strength,\nI am reborn and deaf not dumb, the\nstreet forget' - meanings on a postcard\nplease. Jump n' Shout brings in a bit of\ndancehall sound that has recently been\nenjoying mainstream success such with\nartists such as Glamma Kid. Anyway this\ntune has all the classic dancehall qualifications - a thumping beat, almost indecipherable lyrics and that indefinable\nswing that causes uncontrollable body\nmovement when heard. Nicesh.\nThis album isn't house, garage, pop,\nacid jazz or funk. Basement Jaxx only\nhave one style - if you ain't dancing,\nchange it. It works to superb, effect on\nRemedy. Get the Jaxx, get funky, get\nhappy - what a great remedy for the\nclassic British summer. El Joel\nAFRO CELT\nSOUND SYSTEM\nVolume 2: Release\nIf you were to think that Afro Celt\nSound System made music that\nwas a strange crossover between\ntribal African music and the sort of Irish\nmusic that makes you cringe, you'd be\njust about right. You'd also probably\nthink that it's a blend that's about as\nadvisable as tipping custard in your\nbeer, but on that count you be most\ncertainly wrong.\nSurprisingly the crazy pipes of the\nIrish and the banging tribal drums of\nAfrica fit together like hand in glove, and\nfurther, the blend of Gaelic and African\nvocals doesn't turn out to be such a bad\nidea either. The album features guests\nsuch as Sinead O 'Connor and ex-Pogues\nJames McNally, and although at times\nthe album turns out to be more Irish\nthan African, the cheesy ness of Riverdance is thankfully avoided.\nVolume 2: Release therefore turns\nout to be not as bad as expected and\nshould give the Afro Celt Sound System\na much longer life expectancy than their\nsatanic half-sisters Bewitched. El\nJames\nBARRY ADAMSON FURSLIDE\nThe Murky World Of. Adventure\nJesus, there's me thinking\nPortishead's music was seedy and\ndank. They've got nothing on former Magazine and The Bad Seeds\nmember Barry Adamson, and this\nalbum amply highlights the fact.\nKicking off with a reworking of\nBernstein's title-track from the Sinatra\nSmack-flick The Man with the Golden\nArm we're plunged neck-deep into the\nmire. Horns squeal as they slowly\nasphyxiate and OI' Blue Eyes chases\nthat one last fix. Jesus Devil swings and\nslides with Impeccable grace as Barry\neu log is es about untimely death -mmm mmm, nice! Mitch and Andy\ndescribes the grisly end of a small-time\nhood who gets off on pulling jobs\nwhilst wearing his dead wife's panties -no really, if I'm lying, I'm flying, he pc at. This music would be perfect accompaniment to a James Ellroy novel or\nHubert Selby Jr.'s 'Last Exit to Brooklyn'.\nYou can just imagine a world of petty\nc rims on the make, drag queens wired\noff their tits and chewing the roach of a recently toked joint. The Vibes Ain't Nothin' But The Vibes is lounge-room\nmusic of the most gorgeous sepia-toned hue; John Barry xylophone and\noh-so-cool piano. 007, A Fantasy Bond\nTheme sees reggae beats and a tune\nI'm sure you all know intertwine in\nKingston, Jamaica. Taking tracks from\nthe al burns Moss Side Story, 'o ul Murder, Oedipus Schmoedipus,\nSomething Wicked This Way Comes\nand As Above So Below the collection\npresents us with a real smorgasbord of\neclectic beats, vibes and tunes. El\nChris\nAdventure is the debut album of\nthe New-York based indie band\nfur slide. The album starts off\nwell with Over My Head a rousing tune\nwith some great throaty vocals. Jennifer\nTurner (lead vocals) is plainly the boss\nof this band - belting out tuneful harmonies and growling along with the\nbest of them for the ran ty bits. Of which\nthere are few. I am really glad that\nfur slide haven't taken the route of\nmost female fronted indie bands and\njust whined about how crap it is being\na girl in the '90s. Jennifer knows what\nshe wants and by all accounts has got it\n- she's not afraid to sing about It either.\nOver My Head is a great first track\nwith some tasty distorted guitars and an\nevil catchy chorus that is sure to get\nloads of air time on indie radio and TV\nshows. Jennifer seems to be singing\nabout how scared she is of some newfound responsibilities and how oddly\nhappy she is with the situation.\nMy favourite tune of the album is\nthe hard rocking, organ-ta stic Today Forever. The tune comes complete with a wicked chorus containing some very\nnice sh harmonizing from the rest of the\nband. This track grabs you by the ear\nhole and won't let you go until you are\nwell and truly awake and wide-eyed.\nMy Friend's Gallery is a coy, kooky little grower of a track. It's full of some\nalmost Sergant Pepper-esque moments\nof echo boxes and drums cres endo ing.\nIt doesn't seem like much on first listening but it definitely plants some\nseeds, which blossom on further listen-in gs. The rest of the album, apart from at\nmost 3 other tracks, ultimately just lives\nup to the high expectations set up by the\nfirst track. But only just. Furslide are\nextremely technically proficient - they\njust need to take a little more time on\nthe more creative aspects of the next\nalbum, and perhaps explore more of\nthe electronic aspects of their sound\nwhich emerge towards the end of the\nalbum. It should be a cork er. El\nJoel\n\n"

    "content": "16\nReviews\nFilm 1 June 1999\nNotting Hill * * * *\nStarring : Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Emma Chambers, James Dreyfus, Rhys Ifans, Tim Mclnnerny, Gina McKee\nDirector: Roger Michell\nBy now you must know what\nNotting Hill is all about; the long\nawaited follow-up to second-most-successful-British-movie-of-all-time Four\nWeddings & A Funeral, it starts with\nalmost exactly the same set-up, is driven\nby the same calibre of script, and produces an equally brilliant end product.\nUnless something very strange happens,\nthis will be the most successful British\nmovie of 1999. No question.\nConsidering how many trailers,\nreviews and clips there have been on TV\nand in magazines over the last few weeks,\nyou've probably got a fairly thorough\ngrasp of the plot too - and again, it owes\na lot to its predecessor. Hugh Grant\nreturns, re pleat with comedy hair, upperclass stutter and winning style, and once\nagain he's trying to win over the American girl who keeps disappearing back to\nthe states at inopportune moments. This\ntime, however, there's an even bigger\nchallenge blocking the path to true love,\nas this time the object of his affection just\nhappens to be the biggest movie star in\nthe world... oh, and the Greek-chorus\nsupport characters are back- the dip py girl,\nthe disabled loved-one, the life-long\nInteresting trivia: his salary - $1 million; her salary -$15 million.\nlooser, the weird flat mate and once\nagain they get all the best gags.\nSo haven't we seen this all before?\nWell, no. Sure, it doesn't have the same\nbrilliantly fresh feel of Four Weddings\n(whilst the jokes are all new, their style and\ndelivery is familiar) and, like its pre dec es sor, you can see the end coming from a mile away - yet the quality of the writing\nlifts it head and shoulders above its com-petit or s. The characters come alive (OK, so\nthey're all chara c ture s, but so what); the\nplot twists and turns its way towards its\ninevitable conclusion to a satisfying\ndegree; and Roberts and Grant make a fun (if unlikely) romantic pairing.\nIt's the support cast, however, who\nprovide the real turns of brilliance - indeed\nRoberts has so few lines that she's mostly\nleft to smile and react to those around her,\nwhilst Grant makes the most of the lion's share of the dialogue. BBC stalwarts\nMcKee, Mclnnery and Chambers are on\ntop form (the scene where Grant turns up\nto his sister's party with a date that just\nhappens to be the most famous actress\nin the world is simply superb comedy), but\nthe real star of the show is Ifans. His every\nappearance on screen is a moment of brilliance, as he slides through life completely\nunaware that he's saying and doing completely inappropriate things - and, to take\nnothing away from his movie-stealing per-form ance, it's the quality of writing that's behind it all.\nf ike all sequels, however, it's going to\nsuffer in comparison to its predecessor\n(OK, let's ignore The Godfather Part Two\nfor a moment). It's not as original (for obvious reasons); Hugh Grant's stuttering\nsh tlc k is slightly more predictable, and\ndisbelief just begins to creep in. Yet, it's just as funny, Roberts is clearly superior to\nAndie MacDowell and, if anything, it's even more upbeat -1 defy you to leave the\ncinema In anything less than an incredibly happy mood. Stress relief par\nexcellence. Q Dave\nShe's All That * \u2022 * *\nStarring : Freddie Prinze Jr, Rachael Leigh Cook, Matthew Lillard, Paul Walker, Anna Paquin, Jodi Lyn O 'Keefe\nDirector: Robert Iscove\nOK, before I begin I feel it's only\nfair to warn you that I'm a sucker for really cheesy romantic\ncomedies. More to the point, you'd better be one too, otherwise you're going to\nabsolutely hate She's All That. Filled with\nevery clich e, predictable turn and time-honoured teen caricature in the book,\nit's like an episode of Dawson's Creek\nwith the intelligence surgically\nremoved... yet I loved it. It's brilliantly\nuplifting, unbearably cute and (sur pris ingly) genuinely funny. The only downside is that, like all the best teen flicks, it's completely and utterly detached from\nreality.\nThe premise is simple. Prinze is the\nStudent President, the coolest guy in\nschool, and a cert for Prom King. Yet with\nonly a few weeks to go before that legendary event, he gets dumped by mega-bitch O 'Keefe. Cue rash promise to best\nfriend Walker that he can make any girl\ninto Prom Queen. [If that sounds strangely\nfamiliar, then you're probably thinking of\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (or the\nmusical incarnation, My Fair Lady), which\nthe writers of She's All That seem to have\nborrowed heavily from.] Anyhow, empowered with the ability to pick any girl in the\nentire school, Walker picks introverted\ngeek Leigh Cook as the girl Prinze can't possibly turn into Prom Queen. Er, hello?\nI realise it's a plot requirement, but surely\nunless you're phenomenally shallow, you\ncan't help but realise that this girl is incredibly pretty? Oh well, at least it gives Prinze\nthe opportunity to launch into his winning\n(albeit formulaic) chat-up technique -which, as we're all perfectly aware, can't help but succeed in a movie like this.\nThe point of all this is that, yes, the\nmovie is very predictable, and no, it does-n't have a Kevin Williamson style ironic\ntwist at the end. The movie is formulaic,\nbut the fact that the makers have actually\nspent some time putting some effort into\nthe dialogue, sub-plots and, most Importantly, the material around the edges,\nbrings it to life. Consequently, whilst you\ncan't help but root for Cook and Prinze,\nand yearn for O 'Keefe to meet her come-up pan ce, it's Scream's fill ard who steals\nthe show, overacts like a man possessed\nwhilst remaining thoroughly obnoxious.\nOh, and his dancing is a sight to behold.\nIn truth though, it's the dream-like\nstate of this world that I love (complete with\nmy all time favourite - the comedy syncopated dance routine). After all, who would-n't want to live in a world where\neven the short, fat geeky kid\ngets a girl? Q Dave\n\n"

    "content": "1 June 1999 Games 21\nSilver (PC)\nInfogrames\nMl Role playing games are suddenly gaining\na bit of popularity. Even as far back as the\nold 8-bit prehistory days there were a few\nhardened souls playing the temple trilogy\non the creaky commodore 64, but things\nhave moved on. The worlds are no-longer flat 2D plans and the characters\nand games are much less repetitive than\nthey were. Could Silver be another in the\nline of FFVII and Zelda64 to encourage\nthe average Quake head to take up the\nsword and bow rather than the rocket\nlauncher?\nThe story, above all, the story! They\nall come with a story and Silver is no\nexception to the rule. In a galaxy a long\nway away, or something like that, a despotic and magical ruler (Silver) and his\ncronies rule the land in a way that would\nlead Amnesty International to have a small cat te ry of kittens. His wife's trapped\nin a rather loveless marriage and, realising that Silver is not really the 'let's be\nfriends' kind, kills herself. Silver then goes\nabout the task of finding a new wife by\ntaking all of the women in his kingdom\noff to his castle. A few of the mens folk take offence and start to\nform small camps in the\nforest\nintending\nto bring\ndown Silver and\nbring back the women -and hopefully before tea\ntime.\nYou start as David. His\nwife's been abducted,\nand his grandfather is\nchopped up by Silver's son pretty early in the\nstory - reason enough to\njoin the resistance and\nhunt down Silver and\nhave a chat about police\nstate brutality. Throughout the many worlds, and\ndespite taking control of\nothers as your party\ngrows, he is your main\nfighter character. He's pretty nifty with the sword\nand quite neat with the\nshield, which is handy for\nsupporting any argument\nwith creatures from other\ndemonic worlds. The control method is pretty simple to grasp - the point and click\nmovement and a slightly more complex\nif w point, click and hold down a button to\ndirect the sword and missile targeting\ndoesn't really require many\nhours of practice to master.\nSelecting items is also simplicity itself, though as you\nare rummaging through the\nbackpack the enemies do a good job of turning you into\na David kebab.\nIt would not be a fantasy game without the liberal sprinkling of magic\nitems and spells. David soon\ngets a magical sword which\nfires small painful doses of\nmagic at his enemies, and\nwhile Davy boy isn'ta true\nmagic user, other members\nof your team are much\nmore adept at throwing\nmore powerful magic\nacross the room. The puzzles, though, are fairly basic,-the brain power here is in\norganising the troops and\nfighting the enemy in the\ncorrect\norder rather\nthan working out\nwhich lever\nopens which door, for\nonce I'm not complaining - this is a game which you can enjoy\nrather than lose your hair over.\nThe graphics are impressive for this\ntype of game, the main characters wander about the detailed pseudo 3D back-grounds, and are well animated even if\nthey move a little bit too mechanically-perhaps the arnie swinging shoulder\nlook is back in for the beefed out hero\ntypes. The sounds are also better than\nexpected, swords and shields clank and\nbang, magic fizzles magically and\nmachinery make industrial clanging\nnoises.\nOverall the game will keep you\nentertained for a very long time - longer\nthan it takes for NATO to win a war\nagainst a european state with one army\ntied behind their back. And yes even the\nodd Quake head might be able to put\naside his rocket launcher and move over\nto the fantasy side. Just make sure that\nthey don't realise that they are playing a fantasy game for the first five minutes\nand by then it will be too late - the addiction will have been firmly planted.\nGary S. Dream + Broadcast = Dreamcast\nSega's new 128bit baby prepares for a September birth.\nFresh from the UK post E3 press event for\nSega's new big boy in the console mar-ket, the UK and ace reporter G has gone\nfrom knowing nothing to knowing pretty\nmuch everything about the new\nmachine.\nSega are promising a September\nlaunch, and for your \u00a3199 you get not\nonly the fastest console on the market,\nbut instant access to the internet, e mail\nand a www browser - try all that with a PC for the price. Sega have managed to\nteam up with BT and ICL to create the first\nEurope wide local call cost ISP portal for\nthe Dreamy one. BT will handle the dial\nup and ICL the online service design.\nThe problem with these new shiny\nconsoles is the scarcity of available soft-ware. Whereas the Sony 2 machine\npromises to be able to play old games,\nSega have not gone down this route\nand will instead have ten fresh spanking\nA titles available in September, with\nanother twenty to be released for the\nChristmas rush.\nAside from the e mail and web\nbrowser bits the internal modem does\nhave a gaming use. One of the first will\nbe for Take the bullet.\nTake the bullet is set against a presidential campaign in the late 60's. Playing a bodyguard to a threatened\ncandidate you can defend the main man\nin either first or third person view.\nThough it sounds a little bit like Goldeneye it gives the option of using either the\ncontroller or, for the realist, the Dreamcast light gun. Once again rooms about\nthe country will ring out with the cry\n\"He's armed, take him down\".\nBut where's the modem come in?\nwe all cry. Well there's a fancy deathmatch mode where four players on a single machine can attempt to drill lead\nholes in each other. There is the similar\noption to play the same deathmatch\nover the phone line against fifteen others - see, the modem is used.\nRather than use simple boring bits of\nplastic in order to store game info Sega\nhave created the Visual Memory system.\nThese are bits of plastic with a led display\nthat plug into a hole in the handset. The\nVMS unit not only stores game info and\nscores. It can be used to change options\nwithout them popping up on the screen,\nso if you really wanted you could tell your\nvirtual Beckham to be impetuous and\nkick out without anyone realising or actually noticing. It can be used as a clock and\na calendar (though a watch seems to do\na similar job in my book), it can also be\nused as a hand held games machine and\ncan even connect to another VMS unit to\nplay 2 player games.\nI or all those who want to know what\ngames art; on their way, while looking a little heavy on the arcade side there's a bit of delight for everyone.\nAirforce Delta: KONAMI\nBlue Stinger: SEGA\nCool Boarders DCS : EGA\nJimmy While's2 Cue Ball r VIRGIN Expendable : INFOGRAMES\nFl World Grand Prix : VIDEO SYSTEMS\nHouse Of The Dead 2 : SEGA\nHydro Thunder: MIDWAY\nMarvel VS Capcom : CAPCOM Monaco GP : UBISOFT\nMortal Kombat Gold ; MIDWAY\nM SR (Metropolis) SEGA\nNBA 2000 : SEGA\nPowerstone : CAPCOM NFL Quarterback Club 2000 : ACCLAIM\nRayman 2 : The Great Escape : UBISOFT\nReady To Rumble : MIDWAY\nRed Dog : SEGA\nRedline Racer: UBISOFT\nSEGA Rally 2 : SEGA\nSega Soccer: SEGA\nSonic Adventure : SEGA\nSoul Caliber: NAMCO Speed Devils : UBISOFT\nSupreme Snowboarding: INFOGRAMLS\nTake The Bullet: SEGA\nToy Commander: SEGA\nTrick Style : ACCLAIM\nUEfA Striker: INfOGRAMES\nVirtua Fighter 3TB: SEGA\nWild Metal Country : INFOGRAMES\n\n"

    "content": "18 Clubscene 1 June 1999\nOmnipotence\n@The Imperial Gardens\nCamberwell, SE5. Monthly Fridays,\n10pm6 am, \u00a312/\u00a315. Capacity1,000. Dress code - funky club wear. It was the first birthday of this\never-popular South London night\nabout two months ago, and they characteristically celebrated it in style. The\nnight had all the ingredients necessary\nfor everyone concerned to have a top\nnight out. As I go through the review\nthe list will seem pretty familiar but,\nafter all, that's what makes a night\nout great, and nowadays all too often\nclub promoters in the capital lose sight\nof formula for successful nights.\nFirstly the venue was nice. The\nlayout of small rooms and confusingly\nwinding corridors make the Imperial\nGardens intimate, but never too small\nIn capacity. This place can soak up a surprisingly large amount of c lubbers within its fake-flower decor, although\nit may have been better off having\none really large main dancefloor, as\nthere was a tendency for that old 'bar-near-dancefloor problem' to niggle a bit. But that's only a minor point. Overall the club itself is a great little venue,\ndespite not being very well known.\nAs for the music. Well, they only\nwent and got John \"00\" Fleming to\ncome in and headline. He's perhaps\none of the best around at the\nmoment, and his blend of uplifting\nhard house and soft techno kept\neveryone going until the very end.\nHe was ably assisted by Rachel Auburn\n(of Candy Girls fame), and with this\ncombination there really were no\nlosers on the night. Happy music -that's the only way of describing this\nsort of stuff. Just try and dance to it\nwithout a smile on you face. The way\nall dance music should be, in my op in ion.\nThe promoters also did a fine job,\nwhich is quite an uncommon thing in\nthis era of packaged super-clubs and\nlack of attention to detail. Everything\nwas there on the night, from the\nimportant aspects mentioned above\nto the tiny little things that you notice\nthat make your night one to re mem ber. I am, of course, referring to the\nfreebies that they handed out\nthroughout the night - sweets, mix\ntapes, and even Omnipotence sticks\nof rock. They also laid on piss-take\ngames for people to play when they\nwere relaxing away from the music.\nThe Rubix cubes, chess, checkers, and\ncolouring-in books with crayons were\nvery much appreciated.\nAnd finally, and probably most\nimportantly Omnipotence appears to\nattract a very friendly crowd. Slightly\ndressed up, but not pretentious, the\ncrowd were revisiting the more\napproachable days of clubbing a few\nyears back. Little attitude infiltrated\nthis night, and seeing as how this was\nthe 1 st birthday party, I guess it was full\nof regulars. All in all a great place to\ngo and meet some wonderful people.\nEnjoy.\nPowerful clubbing\nEscape From Samsara\n\\@The Fridge\nBrixton. Fridays, 10.30pm6 am, \u00a33/\u00a310/\u00a312. Capacity - 1,000. Dress\ncode - none.\nWell, what more can we say about\nthis night? Not much really. If you are\na regular reader of Clubscene then\nyou'll have read my review on it a few\nmonths back, and if I was to write\nanother it would just be a carbon\ncopy. You see, EfS never really\nchanges, and this is most definitely a very good thing. Every week it delivers,\nand this is why it is ranked as one of\nthe best club nights in London. If\nyou've been you'll know what I mean,\nand you know you'll keep on going\nagain and again. And if you haven't Club Reviews by Giles\nmade it there yet, then put it right at\nthe top of your must-go places. You\nknow you won't regret it.\nWonderful escapism\nAlbums\n]\nAlbum of the Week\nVARIOUS\n'Necessary Pieces'\n(Nordic Trax)\nCanada's premier record label\nNordic Traxx release their first mix album\n-and what an album it is too. Mixed by\nTyler 'T Bone' Stadius the album is full of\ntracks with deep beats, fresh melodies\nand subtle jazz/ groove? influences.\nOpening the proceedings is Sea to Sky s 'Up Jumped the Boogie' with its cool\nbeats and gentle melody sets the scene\nfor the rest of the album. Sounding very\nmuch like American and UK house\nfused together, you would be forgiven\nthat Laurent Gamier had produced it\nOut In June.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPlaid\n'Rest Proof Clockwork'\n(Warp)\nOn impulse, you think is just a collection of random noises, but when you\nlisten carefully to it you discover it has\nmany influences be it rare groove, funk,\ntechno and even house. The music is\nvery electronic but flows sr fi oo th ly from track to track giving it elegance. A highly\ncomplex album, but Plaid - arguably the\nfinest act of the experimental genre -have created a masterpiece.\n* * * * * \\\nVARIOUS\n'Glasgow Underground Volume 2'\n(Glasgow Underground'\nKicking off with the deep yet jazz\ninfluenced 'Winter Sadness', this double\nCD album takes you'through a spellbinding journey of excellent house\nmusic. The album is a representation of\na scene that is now massive in Scotland\n- that of the Glasgow underground.\nSome of the tunes featured on this 22\ntrack album include Idjut Boys/ Quakerman's 'Frog's Arrrse' with Its thumping\nbass, Romanthony's 'Clap Ya Handz' with\nits fresh guitar licks and gentle start lead\nto. a breakdown that is simply awesome.\nExcellent follow up album to the massive\nfirst volume.\nOut In July.\n* * * * *\n\n"

According to the WHO, 80% of the world's population would say yes,\nand use alternative medicine as a primary source of healthcare. Joanna Marchant investigates...\nAlternative therapies\nare rapidly gaining\nacceptance in the\nWestern world - an\nestimated one third of\nadults have used\nthem.

Some alternative procedures can\nalso be dangerous, for example a cup unc ture, which has been associated with\nseveral life-threatening conditions, including hepatitis B and HIV infections, spinal\ncord injury, septic a emi a and acute\nasthma.\nOther therapies and herbal remedies do not have any effect, and a particularly worrying scenario occurs when\npeople use alternative therapies as a replacement to conventional medical\ntreatment. There are often no regulations controlling practitioners.

Practitioners\nspend time talking to\npatients, listening to their problems and\nencouraging them to relax - an undoubtedly beneficial approach which is scarce\nin the NHS.\nBut do these alternative treatments\nwork, other than as a placebo effect? In\nmost cases we just don't know, and that\nIs precisely the problem.

By the time she came to the\ndoctor she was in the very late stages.\nShe's probably dead now\". The NHS is\nnow moving to integrate many alternative therapies into the service, but the\nbasic problem remains - that most of\nthese treatments are not clinically proven.\nThere is no reasonable evidence that\nthey work, or that they are safe.\nThis situation is starting to change,\nhowever. The Department of Complementary Medicine at the University of\nExeter was established five years ago, the\nfirst of its kind in the world and still the\nonly Complementary Medcine Department in Britain. The department aims to\nconduct rigorous interdisciplinary\nresearch into the efficacy, safety and\ncosts of complementary medicine.

Safety is\na primary concern.\"\nClare's work is going well\nhas already been shown to be at least as\neffective in treating depression as conventional medicines, and with far fewer\nside effects. Other trials being conducted by the department include\nacupuncture for headaches and for\nsmoking cessation, spiritual healing for\nwarts, and homeopathy.

But there are problems. \"One\nof the main difficulties\", explains Clare,\n\"is getting the practitioners to take part\nin our trials. It is irrelevant to them\nwhat the scientific results are - either\nway they will still have\npeople queuing for their\ntherapies.\"\nPeople in society\ntoday are becoming\nmore and more disillusioned with an orthodox\nmedicine that can't provide all the answers, that\nuses drugs which are\nseen as artificial and\nwhich cause side\neffects. Many are now\nturning to the idea of a natural cure. It Is important for us all to realise\nthe danger of ignoring\nthe benefits of some\nherbal medicines and traditional treat-ment s, but also the dangers of turning\nour backs on conventional medicine in\nfavour of untested, anecdotal tte at ment s. The best way forward for Western medicine is undoubtedly an integrated\napproach, but only if the alternative therapies are first subjected to the same rigorous scientific testing as conventional\ndrugs.\n\n"

Statistics\nKevin was pleasantly surprised when\nhe learnt of the real-life nature of the\nstatistics exams taken by first year medical students at Imperial. The exams,\nwhich are taken whilst sitting in front\nof a computer involve being given a set of experimental data, choosing an\nappropriate test, and instructing the\ncomputer to carry the test out. This\nprocess is made idiot-proof by the\ninclusion in the program of a very useful and easy to use 'help system',\nwhich explains the circumstances in\nwhich each statistical test should be\nused, and contains instructions on how\nto interpret the results. Perhaps the\nfact that that no one had specifically\ntold the medics about the 'help' features incorporated into the program\nexplains the fact that not all the\nwannabe doctors passed the exam.\nCarry on regardless\nFor reasons best known to themselves,\nmedics are an arrogant and independent bunch all over the world and\nthose lecturing here at IC's medical\nschool are no exception. Recently a malfunction in the BMS technic s resulted in a medical lecture being\nbroadcast to both the medical and\nbiology lecture theatres. Whilst the lecturing doctors voice was booming out\nof the loudspeakers, a poor biology\nlecturer was left\nhelpless and unable\nto continue her lecture over the ethereal voice of the\ndoctor. The doctor\nlecturing the medics\nwas made aware of\nthe problem; how-ever, as the fault was\nIt's all too complex for its own good.\"\nMIT here we come\nImperial College's status as the MIT of\nEurope in terms of its academic standing is unquestionable. However, Imperial's students have a lot to do before\nwe can compete on\nthe world stage with\nthose at MIT. Students at MIT are\nrevered worldwide\nfor their 'hacks', the\nmost recent of which\nwas to transform a huge classical dome\non one of the Instinot directly affecting A Mostly Harmless Column by tut e's buildings into\nhim he decided to Kevin, a random entity who the Star Wars robot\ncontinue regardless, knows nothing about nothing R2D2.

Pandora's Box is a black box that is kept in\nthe murky depths of the Presidents\nOffice.
