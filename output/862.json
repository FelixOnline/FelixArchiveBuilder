    "content": "Matthew Johnson takes the opportunity to experience Hong Kong's frenetic lifestyle, before the colony and\nits six million people are handed over to Chinese rule.\nTurning Cantonese\nAs the plane entered its final approach for Hong Kong,\nI strained my eyes against the glaring light of the cloud\nwhich enveloped us. Suddenly we broke through, and\nI could see hundreds of buildings huddled in the tight\nspace between shoreline and hillside. The view was\nstatic, and yet the hectic life beneath was screaming\nat you. It is an image which will not rapidly fade.\nHong Kong is so small that it hardly registers on any\nmap, it is barely thirty miles long, and most of this\nspace is still only sparsely populated. It makes one\nmarvel at its crowded population of almost six million\npeople, who export more than the whole of Great\nBritain. Perched on the edge of China, its precarious\nexistence is soon to change when in 1997 it will revert\nto Chinese control. It first came into existence in the\nnineteenth century as a base for English drug barons\nwho wanted a site from which to conduct their trade\nwith the Mainland. Unhindered by heavy taxation and\npolitical upheaval, it has continued as a centre for\ntrade and capital. It enjoys the second highest\nstandard of living in Asia behind Japan, and its lust\nfor profit might make even Mrs Thatcher blush.\nThose who seek after a little enclave of England in\nthe Orient will be disappointed, for Hong Kong is\nvibrantly Chinese. The principles of Feng Shui (the\nbalance of nature) still hold sway over architectural\nscience, and the many traditional temples stand as a testament to the the continuance of Taoist ways. But\nthis is not to say that it is an ancient society, quite\nthe opposite. In fact it is hard to find a building that\nis older than about thirty years. Once a building is no\nlonger needed it is torn down and another built in its\nplace. The bamboo scaffolding used in the\nconstruction of even modern tower blocks is an\ninteresting witness to this unique blend of cultures.\nThis intriguing mix of cultures makes Hong Kong a marvellous place for the traveller. The range of\npossibilities is astounding: from the mountainous\nterrain of the New Territories to the simple life still to\nbe found on many of the little islands to the chic\nshopping arcades and skyscrapers of Central. Its\nreputation for fabulous shopping is also well earned.\nThe price of consumer goods, walk men, calculators,\ncameras etc is generally between one half to two\nthirds the British price, though you should check if it\nis possible to obtain an international guarantee (avoid\nthe tourist trap of Tsim Sha Tsui, go to Mong Kok for\nthis sort of thing). Hand tailoring is also well\nestablished, and it is often possible to have garments\ncustom made for a price equal to or less than the price\nof an equivalent item off-the-peg in England. If you\nwant reasonable quality, it is best to leave 4-5 days\nfor completion. But some of the best buys are\nundoubtedly to be found in the craft section. The silk\nembroidery and hand crocheting are really beautiful,\nand still quite affordable (try Chung Kiu or Nathan\nRoad).\nAlthough the principal language is Cantonese, most\nnotices are also written in English and it is spoken in\nmost shops, banks, restaurants etc. The traveller\nshould find little difficulty in communicating. Food is\nanother good reason for visiting Hong Kong. Most of\nthe different styles are represented (Cantonese,\nShanghaiese, Peking, Vegetarian...), including many\nfrom overseas (Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean...).\nThere is really no lack of variety, or quality. For those\nof you bored stiff by sweet and sour pork or beef chop\nsuey, try real Chinese food for a change. It is three\ntimes as good.\nHowever one of Hong Kong's strengths is also one\nof its weaknesses: its pursuit of profit has become one\nof its principal cultures, a culture which could equally\nwell belong to many other nations. Under the fairly\nbenevolent rule of the British the colony has thrived,\nbut it lacks the knowledge of democracy and the\nsurge of nationalism which might assist its survival.\nIn this regard Britain is much to blame. Having held\nthe territory for about a hundred years, that it should\nwait until the last minute before granting to the people\nof Hong Kong that which its own people enjoy as a right is really a scandal. That is not to say that Hong\nKong could live independently: not only is it physically\njoined to the Mainland, but depends on it for both food\nand water. Considering how much blood was shed to\npreserve the liberty of only two thousand Falkland\nIslanders, it seems a travesty that we should dismiss\nsix million people so carelessly.\nWith the return to Chinese rule imminent, the\noutflow of skilled people is considerable. There is no\none who has not considered such an option, though\nfor the vast majority escape is impossible. It has been\nargued that Hong Kong is too much of a jewel for the\ncommunists to risk damaging its future and their own\nchance for economic revival. But it is also a source\nof ideas of liberty and justice. For a sick ger on to c racy, driven to massacre its own people to retain power,\none may well ask whether this will prove simply too\ndangerous for them.\nMatthew G Johnson.\nPage 10\n\n"

The\nprogramme will be concerned with the future of the\nnuclear industry and the economics of energy\nProfessor Goddard, head of the Nuclear Powers\nsection of Mechanical Engineering, said that the BBC\nhad approached him to ask for his help on studying\nthe future availability of professional staff to keep the\nindustry running safely.\nThe students are all taking the Nuclear Engineering\noption and the programme is expected to be screened\non the 28th March this year.\nTwo episodes of the Channel Four programme\n'Fourth Dimension' will be filmed in a tent on the\nQueen's lawn this Saturday (3rd March). The series\nlooks at current science issues.\nPeople interested in taking part in the debate,\nentitled 'the Greening of Science', should turn up at\n11.00 am on the Queen's Lawn. At 5.15 a second\nfilming run will include more features on Imperial\nCollege; Professor Davies from the Aeronautical\nEngineering department will be on the panel.\nComplaints\nThe ICU Elections Commitee, who are responsible\nfor overseeing the way in which the ICU sabbatical\nelections are run, dismissed a complaint about the\nconduct of a Presidential candidate on Thursday.\nThe complaint was lodged by two other candidates\nfor the post of President. The candidate denied\nallegations of breaking publicity rules by fixing\nstickers and handouts to walls. The Elections\nCommittee felt that there was no proof that the\ncandidate or his supporters were responsible for the\nlocation of the stickers and handouts and dismissed\nthe complaint.\nThe candidate was told that if any candidate or any\ncandidate's supporters were caught breaking election\nrules, they would be excluded from the election.\nSellout\nSt Mary's Union President, Rhydian Hapgood, has\nagreed to a plan for the proceeds of the sale of tennis\ncourts at St Mary's Hospital Medical School's sports\nground in Teddington to go towards building a new\nIC hall of residence. The money will be donated to\nthe Imperial College/St Mary's Merger Appeal fund.\nA condition of the donation to the fund is that\nImperial College must also make an 'appropriate\ncontribution' towards the cost of the hall.\nLecture I Constantine S. Nicandros, President and Chief\nExecutive of Conoco Incorporated, spoke at IC on\n'The Innovation Imperative' last Tuesday. It was the\nfirst 'Sir Barnes Wallis lecture', to be held annually,\nsponsored by the Instute of Patentees and Inventors.\nA good attendance of over 100 people was reported.\nStudents slept out on the college walkways in\ncardboard boxes last Tuesday night to help the\nCentrepoint Soho charity for young down-and-outs.\nThirty-five students from the West London\nChaplaincy attempted to sleep from 10.30pm until\n9.30am the following morning outside the entrance\nto the Electrical Engineering Department.\nMs Rachael Kitley, a second year Life Scientist,\nsaid that each of the students had been sponsored for\nroughly \u00a330-\u00a340 each. 'It wasn'ta very cold night,\nbut we were still not able to sleep properly', she\nadded.\nLecture II Rugby win\nThe director of the IC Humanities department, Mr Eric Stables, will be giving a talk under the title 'Satire\non Campus: Universities and the Comic Novel'. It\nwill be held in the Read lecture theatre, level 5\nSherfield, at 1.15pm on Tuesday 6 March.\nPrizes\nAn award of \u00a3750 was made to Alan Smith, an IC\nPetroleum Engineering MSc graduate, on the 23rd February. The money was given by a British oil\ncompany in recognition of his high standard of work\nand 'maturity and leadership qualities' according to\nhis former tutor, Dr Raad Issa.\nThe same company also gave \u00a3500 to Andrew\nScott, an IC Chemical Engineering undergraduate,\nin January.\nA strong IC team took to the field at Motspur Park\nto loud support from over 100 IC supporters on a windy rainy Sunday. Scoring a try virtually from the\nkick off, IC soon consolidated with two penalties to\nlead 10-0. By the time St Thomas' had their hooker\nsent off mid-way through the first half (for injudicious\nuse of the knee), the general feeling in the crowd was\nnot whether we would win but rather by how many.\nTwo more tries gave IC a lead of 18-0 at half-time.\nPlaying into the wind in the second half, IC scored\nanother try before St Thomas' even bothered the\nscorer. However, stout defence by IC restricted them\nto two penal i ties whilst IC ran in another try to give\na resounding victory of 26-6 at full-time. Fine\nperformances from all the team both in attack and\ndefence combined to ensure everybody had an\nexcellent reason to spend Sunday evening engineering\na massive hangover for the next morning.\nCompetition Elections\nA two week tour of Japan is a prize for an essay\ncompetition organized by the Japan Information and\nCultural Centre (465 6500). The essay is entitled\n'Japan-European Relationship in the 21st Century'.\nThe offer closes on the 10th April. Details are\navailable from the Union office or the Japanese\nEmbassy (number given above).\nAlmost 200 people attended the hustings for the four\nUnion Sabbaticals took place last Thursday in the\nJunior Common Room. A hustings was also held at\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School last Monday.\nVoting will take place in all departments on the 5th and 6th March.

Please be\nready to produce your union cards at the ballot box.\nObituary Auction\nFriends were saddened and profoundly shocked by\nthe death of Juan Martinez in a motor accident on\nFebruary 26th. He first came to Imperial College in\n1986 to undertake a MSc course in the Physics\nDepartment and continued his studies for a PhD\nDegree of which he was already in his 3rd year.\nFriends will miss his happy smile and great sense of\nfun which touched so many of the lives around him.\nHe was a very special individual and a credit to his\nfamily.\nFriends and acquaintances are invited to attend a Requiem Mass to be held on Monday March 5th at\nthe Brompton Oratory, Old Brompton Road at\n12.30pm in his honour.\nThe government's plans to expand Britain's Universities could result in Universities 'bidding' for\nstudents at-prices recommended by the Universities\nFunding Council (UFC), according to a report in The\nIndependent.\nThe University of East Anglia believes that this will\nresult in a fall in the number of science applicants\nbecause the tuition fees will be more expensive per\nscience student than for an arts student.\nThere are rumours that the mandatory payment of\ntuition fees by students' borough councils will be\nphased out. This would be replaced by charging the\nstudent directly.\n\n"

    "content": "A visit to Peru can provide high drama and some of the most dramatic scenery in the world.\nMartians in darkest Peru\nThe final leg of our 24 hour journey to Bolivia was in\na small Lloyd-Aero-Bolivair plane from Line to La Paz.\nThe Lufthansa flight could go no further than Lima,\nas La Paz Airport is 4000m up and the atmosphere\nis too thin to allow jumbos to land, even with the\nrunway double the length. Getting on the plane we\nwere greeted with a 'Buenos noces' from a stewardess and an incongruous party atmosphere.\nIncongruous at 2am local time. We were closely\nfollowed by the ju bill ant Bolivian football team who\nmust have just beaten Peru and we resigned ourselves\nto clapping and cheering them with the rest of the\npassengers as if they were our home team. At La Paz\nwe were greeted by television cameras and a bleary\neyed 'Welcome to Bolivia' by our tour courier.\nThe advantage of travelling with your parents is that\nyou don't have to pay. No more slogging away at the\nlocal newsagents for months before; just persuade\nthem when they next have a windfall (like a retirement\nlump-sum for example) that it would be wonderful to\ntake a family holiday in some choice exotic location.\nSimple. But there are drawbacks: you have to go at\ntheir pace and on our tour, the average age was 55\nand there was no one the right side of\nthirty something. Altitude was not only a problem for aircraft: many\nof our party suffered from headaches and altitude\nsickness and one woman had to be given oxygen and\nwas flown home. Things at 4000m go very slowly,\nincluding the Bolivians, and their economy.\nThroughout this part of South America, one cannot\nescape the feeling that the Spanish conquistadores\nraped the country and, with independence, Bolivia\nwas left to pick up the pieces. La Paz has a unique\nhybrid cultural heritage of Spanish and Inca elements.\nThe Churches are built in the 'Mestizo Baroque' style\nwhich compromises Christian saints with pagan Inca\ngods, basically so that the indigenous population could\nidentify with Christianity. But with its economy largely\nbased on fluctuating tin markets and the coca leaf\nBolivia hasn't much more than its football team to\ncelebrate.\nWe crossed Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable\nlake in the world, by hydrofoil and landed in Peru.\nImmediately as we stepped onto dry land vendors of\nllama rugs, sweaters and wall hangings were upon us.\nThis was to become a recurrent theme during the\nholiday. With inflation running at over 1000% our\nAmerican dollars were particularly sought after. We\npaid a visit to the increasingly commercialised floating\nreed islands of the Uros Indians and the next day we\ntook a fifteen hour train ride through the Andes to\nCuzco, the Inca's ancient capital. The train was hard\neven in 'luxury' tourist class but fortunately the, now\nirritating, vendors were largely excluded from our\nseparate carriage. The scenery was not as spectacular\nas one had been led to believe either; flat tish planes\ninstead of dazzling white mountains. At dusk we came\nto a sudden halt, at first we feared it might be Maoist\nterrorists. In fact, in the fading light, the driver had\nfailed to spot a drunk lying on the line and had run him\nover. We arrived five hours late, but by this stage no\none seemed to really mind.\nThe next few days were spent admiring the feats\nof the Inca civilisation: its architecture, metalwork and\ncraft works. We toured many a crumbling temple or\nfortress including the legendary Machu Picchu (The\nLost City of the Incas) which was stunning. We stayed\novernight in the hotel adjacent to the site and at\nsunrise the feeling of world less ness was quite\nunimaginable.\nFor the remainder of the holiday we descended the\nAndes by coach and drove up the coast through\ndeprived Peruvian towns with little to recommend\nthem as far as package tours are concerned. At Nazca\nwe flew in light aircraft over the 2000 year old Nazca\nlines. Animal shapes, often 100 metres across, etched\nin the desert and only visible from the air. Why the\nNazca civilisation should draw figures that it could not\nsee itself remains a mystery. One hypothesis is that\nthe lines were created by Martians as one of the\nfigures resembles an astronaut!\nOur final stop was Lima. A city of ten million people,\nmost of whom live in shanty towns. It's not surprising\nthen that 80% of tourists fall victim to either theft or\nattempted theft. One of our party was punched in the\nback and another had his trousers irreparably slit in\nan attempt to steal his money belt. Our courier asked\nhim whether he had lost anything; 'only my dignity'\nhe replied. Fortunately, for my trousers at least, I succumbed to the inevitable food poisoning for the\nlast two days and was confined to bed. During this\nthere was a hotel strike, a prolonged power cut and\ngeneral civil unrest in the adjacent Plaza des Armas.\nMercifully I was attended by one of the three doctors\nin our party: one advantage of going on a package\nholiday for the bourg eos ie. It's also a lot safer\ntravelling en masse; one lone British backpacker in the\nhigh Andes was captured by the Maoist terrorists,\ngiven a mock trial in the village square (for being\nBritish) and promptly shot by firing squad. But don't let this put you off going-it's all part of the\nadventure.\nAdrian Pagan.\nHHjjjHHjH^^^^HflflHB\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "Invasion ofthe killer ballot boxes\nOn March 5 and 6 the whole of the campus will be\ninvaded by a species known as 'the ballot box'. This\nblack creature reaches a height of about 18 inches and\nexists on a diet of ballot papers.\nThere is a very particular way to feed a ballot box.\nEach example will be accompanied by a 'minder' who\nwill check your Union card and punch a hole in it. He\nor she will then hand you 4 ballot papers (one for each\nsabbatical post).\nThe Single Transferable Vote (STV) System is used\nin the selection of candidates. You place a1 next to\nthe candidate who, in your opinion, is the best. You\ncan stop here or, if you wish, choose a second choice\nby putting a2 next to another candidate, and so on\nuntil there are no candidates left or until you think no\nmore are worthy of a vote.\nYou cannot give candia tes equal preference and\nnumbers must be in consecutive order starting with 1.\nEvery ballot paper has the choice of 'New Election'\non it. If you make this your first choice you are making\na very serious statement. You are saying that there\nare no suitable candidates for the post. If you make\nit your second choice then you are saying that there\nis only one candidate which is suitable and that you\nwould rather have a new election than have anyone\nelse winning. If you vote for New Election for a joke\nthen you are partially responsible for the waste of\nabout \u00a31000.\nDo not mark your ballot paper with anything but\nnumbers or it will be deemed invalid.\nBallot boxes are open between 10am and 5pm. They stay sealed until the count begins. A candidate\nmust pass quota to be elected. Quota is half the total\nvotes minus spoilt (invalid) papers plus one.\nMathematicians among you will realise that it is\nimpossible for two candidates to achieve this magical\nby Fiona Nicholas, Returning Officer\nnumber. During the first round of counting only first\nchoices are counted. If a candidate reaches quota at\nthis point then he is elected. If not, the candidate with\nthe fewest votes is taken out of the running and his\nsecond choices are reallocated to the remaining\ncandidates. The disregarded candidate may have had\nsome ballot papers with only a first choice on them.\nThese cannot be transferred; the total number of\nvotes is decreased and so is quota. This process of\nreallocating votes continues until one candidate\nreaches quota or until the only remaining candidate\ndoes not have enough votes to pass quota. If the latter\nsituation arises, the election must be re-run.\nJust to end, here are a few examples of valid and\ninvalid papers:\nValid papers\nCandidate A4 Candidate B2 Candidate C3 Candidate D1 New Election 5\nCandidate A Candidate B1 New Election 2\nCandidate A New Election 1\nInvalid papers\nHow much for your vote ?\nCandidate A Candidate BX Candidate C New Election\nCandidate A Candidate B Candidate A1 Candidate B Candidate C New Election 3\nCandidate A1 Candidate B Candidate C1 New Election\nNew Election\n\n"

    "content": "IMechE WellSoc\nEuropean industry is preparing for a home market\nof 320 million people. UK companies seeking a competitive share in this market will soon be recruiting\nprofessional engineers from a pan-European pool of\ntalent. The European Commission is committed to\nenabling qualified members of a profession to practice\nanywhere in the European Community. Young\nengineers graduating in the UK will therefore gain\nmany opportunities to extend their horizons. There will\nbe strong competition for their skills, but anticipating\nemployers initial uncertainty over the relative\nstandards of engineering qualifications, job seekers\nwill need to be prepared.\nThe Eurling title is a move to obtain common\nrecognition across Europe of a professional\nengineering education. An engineer who achieves\nchartered status with an Institution such as the\nIMechE or IEE, is qualified to apply for the Eurling title.\nMany have done so already. They see it becoming a 'passport' giving them greater mobility and\nrecognition for working in Europe. The Federation of\nEuropean National Associations of Engineers hopes\nthe move will lead to greater coherence for the\nengineering profession in Europe, promoting our\ncompetitiveness with Japan and the USA.\nThe implications of the Single European Act for\nengineering and a checklist for the providers of\nengineering education and training will be presented\nin an IMechE lecture on March 6. Professor Jack Levy,\nthe Director-Engineering Profession of the\nEngineering Council, will also describe the Eurling title\nand how it reflects the engineering profession's commitment to heightened activity and mobility for\n1992. The Greater London Young Members' Section\nwould like to invite you to attend this lecture, to be\nheld at 6.30pm in room 342 in the Department of\nMechanical Engineering at Imperial College. We hope\nthis will provide an opportunity for both students and\npractising engineers to find out how best to qualify\nfor a career in Europe. Coffee will be served from 6pm and after the lecture there will be a buffet and time\nfor informal discussion. We would also like to enable\nthose who offer education and training in engineering\nto discuss the challenge of Europe with Professor\nLevy, a former head of department at City University.\nRockSoc\nAt the beginning of last term, RockSoc staged its first\never gig with a live band and rock disco. It was a great\nsuccess and since then we've continuously been\nasked to do it again. On March 8 we're putting on an\neven bigger and better show.\nWith backing from ULU RockSoc, we've got ETA\nand support and a disco all for \u00a32. ETA have recently\nbeen playing the clubs around London and last week\nsupported Excalibur. They play a mixture of mainly\noriginal material plus a few covers [AC-DC, Georgia\nSatellites, Motley Crue). Their music will appeal to\nalmost all rock fans being neither out and out thrash\nmetal or sleazy glam rock. Needless to say this is an\nevent not to be missed and will start in the Union at\n8pm. When set up three years ago, RockSoc didn't originally intend to put on these shows, so the large\nbudget required to do so was never applied for. The\nclub's objectives have now been changed to include\nsuch events. Next year we hope to expand this and\nput on more bands, but we need support. We know\nthere's an interest in College, so if you want to see\nmore Rock music at IC come to the RockSoc AGM\non Monday March 5 at 12.30pm in Southside Upper\nLounge.\nHow would you like to run around 27 acres of\nwoodland shooting people with paintball guns? On\nMarch 14 WellSoc will be holding its annual Skirmish\ntrip to Bullswood Skirmish site in Surrey. We will be\nleaving from College at 12.45pm, returning when it\ngets too dark to continue. If you are interested in an\nenjoyable, muddy afternoon killing people, send a cheque for \u00a311 (please write membership number on\nthe back) to N Williamson, Physics 2 or see any\ncommittee member. This will cover transport and\nentry to the game. Extra ammunition will be available\nat \u00a32 for 12 rounds and hire of camouflage jackets\nand trousers will be available.\nWellSoc members may well receive a subsidy but\nICSF are also invited along for the same \u00a311. Hurry:\nwith this discounted entry, places will go quickly.\nVino!\nOn Tuesday we were given a real taste of Australia.\nOrlando produces about 20% of all Australian wines\nincluding 'Jacob's Creek'-Australia's number one\nseller. Penfold, Lindeman and Orlando (referred to as\nthe PLO) alone are responsible for 50% of Australian\nwine production. In spite of these impressive\ncredentials Orlando remains relatively undiscovered in\nthis country.\nSimon Ladenburg of the Orlando UK office\nintroduced us to the high-tech side of the Australian\nwine 'industry' with a corporate video depicting\nstretches of huge stainless s tell fermentation tanks,\nlabs filled with scientists analysing samples and halls\nof roaring automated bottling lines. For all this\ntechnology, however, it is still the palate of the master\nwine maker, Robin Day, who judges the merit of the\nwine in the bottle.\nAppropriately, we began with a Jacob's Creek Dry\nWhite retailing at \u00a33.29 and tasted our way up a superb 1986 St Hilary Chardonnay for \u00a37.20. A little\nconfusion was generated by the ' 1989' vintage of the\nJacob's Creek which Simon resolved by explaining\nthat the Australians harvest their grapes in\nFebruary/March-six months ahead of the Beaujolais\nNouveau hype. This summer you may even see some\n1990 Australian wines on the shelves.\nThe reds were started off by Jacob's Creek Dry\nRed, which is marketed in Australia as 'claret'\nalthough it contains 65% Shiraz: a distinctly forbidden\ngrape variety in Bordeaux. Clear favourite of the three\nreds was a1986 St Hugo Cabernet Sauvignon\n(\u00a37.20) which Orlando considers its best-a deep\nwine with ripe berry/black current flavours and a very\nlong finish.\nThe evening was rounded off with a curiosity: a fortified port-style muscat from the Morris family in\nRuthergled who have been making it for generations.\nIt charmed us all with its thick sweet f iggy flavours\nand long warm nutty finish, a steal at \u00a37!\nDon't miss next Tuesday's Sherry tasting, given by\nthe Sherry Institute of Spain, which is sure to convert\nyou if you're not already an addict. Put into your diary\nthe tasting of white wines from Bordeaux by or Hon\nPresident and Editor of Decanter. Dave Rowe (March\n13), the Coffee tasting (March 15) and lastly the\ntasting of Alsace wines (20 March).

Don't forget the March 21 booze cruise costing\nca. \u00a310.\nOSC\nInternational\nElection time has come round again and this also\nmeans election time for the Overseas Students\nCommittee. Since hardly any soul walking around at\nImperial College knows what this committee does, let\nus just try to explain some of our activities.\nWhat is the OSC?\nThe Overseas Students Committee (OSC) is one of\nthe Union Major Sub-Committees (MSCs) supervising\nand cooperating with the functioning of the overseas\nstudents societies. These are the various national and\ninternational societies at Imperial College. The\nmembers of the OSC are the sports, welfare, events,\nliaison and publicity officers, 7 ordinary members, the\nsecretary, the treasurer and the chairman.\nWhat does the OSC do?\nThroughout the year, the OSC organises inter-society\nsports tournaments: volleyball, soccer and others. It\nsubmits the societies' grant claims to the Union (after\na detailed inspection) and defends the Overseas\nStudents rights and welfare interests on several Union\nand College committees. The Welfare Officer and\nChairman are allowed the joys of sitting on a large\nnumber of Union and College committees, all very\nenjoyable and rewarding. When there are problems\nwith the organisation of societies, the OSC attempts\nto solve these problems. The highlight of the year is\nwithout doubt the International Week, which is\ncoordinated by the OSC and is guaranteed to be a lot\nof fun to organise.\nWhen are the elections?\nHopefully you now know a bit more about the OSC.\nOur elections will be held in the last week of term.\nBefore then, feel free to get in touch with us.\nThe Overseas Students Committee.\nPicoCon 8\nJust when you thought it was safe to open FELIX\nagain...the PicoCon article strikes back! Tomorrow\nImperial College Science Fiction Society is holding\nPicoCon 8, the eighth (you don't say) in its line of\nannual SF Conventions. With videos, guest authors,\nsilly quizzes and more there is something for every\ntaste in the SF and Fantasy range.\nFor those interested in reading SF (and the authors\nwho write it) we've got talks by Bob Shaw and Dave\nLangford, both well known as British SF writers. If TV\nand Film is your line, we've got a video programme\nincluding Blake's7, Star Trek: The Next Generation,\nThe Prisoner, Monty Python and more.\nSpace enthusiasts can hear talks on Space Tourism\nand Terraforming, while war gaming types can see a live role-playing demonstration courtesy of Wargames\nSociety.\nWe also have traditional fun in the form of The\nQuiz-watch teams from Britain's great universities\n(plus 0****d and c******'e) do battle with each\nother. See authors expound on the Discussion Panel,\nand listen to SF hacks sing at the Folk Workshop! Or\njust wander around our dealer room.\nPicoCon 8 runs from 10am to 10pm on Saturday\nMarch 3. Admission is \u00a34 for members, \u00a35 for non-members. All events take place in the Union Building.\nAbsolutely no train spotters.\nPage 15\n\n"

    "content": "An adventurous holiday need not cost the earth, writes Ian Hodge.\nCheap and cheerful\nBefore you jet off to the four corners of the world\nperhaps you should stop and think again. Rather than\nspend hundreds of pounds flying to dark dank\ndestinations think about staying somewhere a little\ncloser to home (and more sociable).\nThe Youth Hostel Association is a charity originally\nset up to allow young people to unearth the delights\nand pleasures of Britain without it costing a fortune.\nThe hostels are open to all, but the initial aim persists\nand the prices are kept as low as possible.\nAlmost without exception the hostels are converted\nbuildings ranging from schools to vicarages and\nfarmer's cottages in some of the more remote\nlocations.\nIt will never be up to five star standard, could you\nafford it if it was? but it will be very friendly and\ninformal with the warden making you feel at ease very\nquickly. The atmosphere is not clique y at all and new\nmembers are made more than welcome.\nThe prices range from \u00a32.60 for a simple hostel, no\nmore than a hut with toilets, beds and a kitchen, to\n\u00a37,50 for the equivalent of the Hilton with carpets and\na television. There is a full range of prices between\nto match anyone's budget and even food is available\nif you feel like having a break from your own cookery.\nThe hostels are not all in national parks with many\nof them in seemingly uninteresting parts of the\ncountry, but this is the one of the delights of staying\nin a hostel. You can discover the true nature of the\ncountry, find the hidden character and enjoy yourself\nmuch more than if you were tramping up the\nmountains with thousands of others.\nIf the idea of sleeping in dormitories worries you\nthen do not fret, they are not long stark rooms with\nbeds lined up like soldiers on parade. The rooms have\nabout twenty beds in them,normally bunk beds, and\nthey are light and clean and not oppressive at all.\nAll hostels have a member's kitchen so that you can\ncook your own food. The cutlery, crockery and all\ncooking equipment is provided. One small tip is to take\nyour own matches and a tea towel, they should be\navailable but both tend to become damp and not work\nvery well.\nIn addition to the basic needs of sleep and food the\nhostel will have a small communal area with soft\nchairs and books. You should soon find yourself\ntalking to people you have never met before and will\nnever see again.\nA key to enjoying your stay in any hostel is not to\nbe reserved and stilted, everybody else is in a new\nenvironment so muddle through together.\nTo help keep prices as low as possible you will be 1\nasked to perform some sort of task in the hostel. This\nnever takes up much time and sweeping the floor is\nnot much of a hardship and remember its saving you\nmoney!\nMembership this year is \u00a34.00 for under 21 's and\n\u00a37.60 if over.If you would like to try hosteling but\ndon't want to become a full member until you are sure\nthen go to any hostel and ask fora guest pass. It will\ncost you \u00a32.60 and allows you to stay in any hostel\nfor two nights. If you decide to become a full member\nyou can use the pass to get a two pound reduction\non the membership fee. If you know somebody who\nis a full member then they can take you to any hostel\nfor three nights and you will only be charged the\nnormal hostel charges. '\nMembership does have other advantages, it entitles\nLast summer, after finishing my exams with a mad\nrush of relief, I felt like a holiday; nothing fancy, just\nto get away from the pressure that had been\nsurrounding and enveloping me for the last few\nmonths.\nI had joined the YHA the year before to go to the\nIsle of Wight, a stones throw from my home town of\nPortsmouth. Perhaps a little further from home this\ntime so I began to search through the handbook for\na suitable destination.\nMy first thought was to try York, a historic city that\nI had never visited and with plenty to do. My hopes\nwere dashed as the hostel was booked for the next\ntwo weeks and I started a job in three.\nAs a second thought I tried several of the Hostels\nin north Wales and I hit lucky. Both LLeder Valley and\nIdwal Cottage had room available when I wanted to\ngo. Within a week I had booked my rooms, bought\nmy ticket and was on my way.\nThe journey was an uneventful one, British Rail\nmanaging to keep to its timetable for once and after\nthree and a half hours I arrived in Llandudno Junction\nonly to have to wait an hour and a half before a train\nto Betws-y Coed.\nI stayed for three nights in Lleder Valley during\nwhich time I managed to climb one small mountain\nand wander over some of the bleakest and windiest\ncountry that I had met for a long time. The views from\nthe hills were fantastic and were well worth the effort\nput in.\nyou to a ten per cent discount in all YHA adventure\nshops (there's one south of Covent Garden) and their\nprices are already the lowest around. You will also be\nentitled to discounts in various shops and museums\nthroughout the country; every little helps.\nTo become a member send your money to the\nYouth Hostel Association, Trevelyan House, 8 St.\nStephen's Hill, St. Albans, Herts AL1 2DY. The youth hostel network is a national asset, don't allow it to die from lack of use. There is a whole\ncountry out there for you to explore so before you jet\noff to far flung countries find out where you come\nfrom first.\nIn Wales, it hails\nThe hostel was an old cottage and had about\nseventy beds and was a grade 4, middle of the range.\nInside there was plenty of space and a lovely wooden\nfloor in the dinning room. The kitchen itself was\nsupplied by a gas cylinder of propane that was visible\nfrom the window, perhaps a bit dangerous?\nDuring my stay I met a very friendly and normal\nAmerican (yes, they do exist) and together we had\na long discussion about the American presidential\nelection. Even then there were jokes about Dan\nQuayle, 'I wouldn't buy a used car from him' was a remark that has stuck in my mind.\nTravelling on to the second hostel the weather\nturned nasty and so my initial aim of climbing another\npeak had to be abandoned. Idwal Cottage is situated\non the A5 trunk road to Holyhead and so the traffic\ncan become a little heavy, literally. At one stage a lorry\ncame along the road that filled almost both lanes and\nwas accompanied by four police motorcyclists.\nUnfortunately when I arrived at the hostel I was a. couple of hours early and the hostel had not opened\nyet. Waiting for two hours in the pouring rain was not\nfun but finally the door opened and I could begin to\ndry off.\nMy troubles were not over as a school party arrived\nand brought all the things I had been trying to forget,\nnoise and disorder. The main body of the hostel was\nan old farmer's cottage but I was in the annexe that\nwas a converted chapel with an iron gate and three\ninch thick oak door.\nThe kids did not manage to ruin my stay but they\ndid begin to grate after a few days. They spent most\nof the night swinging from the rafters but after a few\nwell placed words they eventually stopped.\nThe local scenery was very rocky and there were\nseveral geologists that were making surveys of the\nrocks in the area. Regrettably for all of us the weather\nclosed in and nobody could do anything for almost two\ndays.\nI did manage to get to Llandudno and see The Great\nOrme and the pollution that is the Irish Sea. The town\nis a typical seaside town and there is a shop that sells\nthe largest walnut whirls in the country. Four inches\nhigh and 50p, most of it is cream but they taste great.\nWhen the weather did clear it was time to go home,\nregrettably I did not manage to climb many large\npeaks, not even Snowdon. It now costs nearly ten\npounds to go up by train, and the summit was cloaked\nin mist the whole time I was there.\nIt was a fun holiday, I had enjoyed myself greatly\nas all the people I had met had been friendly, and it\nwas well worth the money spent.\nThe cost had been about thirty pounds to get there\nby train, twenty for the accommodation and the same\nfor food. Added to this was about ten pounds for\nmiscellaneous expenses making a total of eighty\npounds. The transport was by far the most expensive\npart and from now on I'm going everywhere by coach.\nPage 9\n\n"

Though it seems the risk was too\nmuch and instead Slow Motion Kisses has been\nreleased already as the first single. This is a soft and\nsubtle, whispering track.

The Hamsters are lined up to top\nthe bill, a blues based rock band, making classic rock\nguitar sounds, tempered with good ol' 12 bar blues\nas in their rendition of Down to the Doctor.

    "content": "Why? Oh Why?\nDear Editor,\nIt is not often that I feel very annoyed at any of the\nletters in FELIX but I feel I have found an exception.\nDylan James has apparently never noticed that a significant proportion of all higher education students\nlive in accommodation provided by their colleges.\nConsequently none of the rent they pay covers the\nrates charged for that residence and therefore the Poll\nTax is merely an extra charge that their, already\nmeagre, grant has to cover.\nPerhaps he thinks we should write to the University\nGrants Council to request subsidy for this ridiculous\ncharge since they will no longer be paying the rates\nfor College accommodation!\nAlso, it seems unlikely that the landlords who are\novercharging many students for private\naccommodation, (since they are only short hold tenants) will find it within their hearts to decrease the\nrents when the Poll Tax arrives.\nTake the blue rosettes out of your eyes Mr James\nand you will see how ludicrous it is to introduce a 'fair'\ntax in a grossly unfair society.\nDave Matthews, Elec Eng 1.\nOh Why?\nDear Dave,\nAs a second year student living in Hamlet Gardens\npaying \u00a345 per week rent I would be delighted to pay\n\u00a3 100 a year less with the introduction of the Poll Tax\n(sorry, Community Charge) as stated by Dylan James.\nIt occurs to me, however, that Mr James is living\nin a different world from most students at Imperial.\nHow many landlords are going to reduce rent with the\nintroduction of the Poll Tax given that they can gain\napproximately \u00a35.25 per week per student? Very few\nI suspect. I suspect it's also unlikely that private\nlandlords will give rent breakdowns for enquiring\nstudents, more likely that the students will get\nnervous breakdowns.\nRealistically it benefits no one except for an\nexclusive few in certain boroughs of London.\nLet's all thank Mrs T for making landlords rich.\nYours sincerely,\nS Harrison, Physics 2,\nD Lane, Physics 2,\nS Gillings, Physics 2,\nOh Why?\nDear Dave,\nI would like to point out the 'misinformation' which\nDylan James chose to propagate in his letter last week\n(FELIX issue 860).\nMr James states a figure of \u00a35.25 for a typical\nstudent rates bill. What he conveniently fails to\nmention is that most students are entitled to a80% rebate on their rates, thus paying only \u00a340 per\nacademic year.\nAs for Westminster's Poll Tax of \u00a3200, this can be\nattributed to the fact that the City has an unusually\nlarge number of businesses which will be crippled by\nthe uniform business rate.\nAnyone who suggests that Poll Tax is a fair system\nis either thick or Conservative, the two not necessarily\nbeing distinguishable.\nYours sincerely,\nS A Ghouse (Chem Eng 3).\nDear Dave,\nRE: Asian Soc.\nI would like to disclose a few facts which I think\neveryone has a right to know (especially the members)\nabout the life story of Asian Soc, and raise a few\nquestions.\nFirstly the only reason Bhertendu set up an Asian\nSoc was because he knew no one would have elected\nhim as President for the Indian Soc. It was an ego trip.\nThe setting up was helped by 'contacts' eg former\nIndia Soc president Kob and by his dear friend Wouter\n(OSC Chairman) who pushed the motion through the\nUnion.\nI am a member of the Asian Soc and the reason I joined it was because it was meant to represent a more cultured part of Asia. This is why Asian Soc was\nnot merged with the Indian Soc according to\nBhartendu. The actual reason the two societies did not\nmerge was because they would have had to have reelection for which Bhart was not too keen on.\nI have yet to go to any cultured event Asian Soc\nhas organised. There have been a few discos which\nreally don't justify the purpose of the society. If I wanted to go to discos, I could have gone to a lot\nbetter ones elsewhere.\nThe actual running of the society is questioned. The\ntreasurer resigned due to, quote 'dictatorship'. That\nthe society is in debt I find hard to believe, since Asian\nSoc boasts to have over one hundred members with\nmembership at \u00a31.50, this already amounts to \u00a3150.\nThis plus Union subsidy is more than any newly\nformed society could want. The tickets for the first\nevent were sold at an average price of five pounds,\nI was not present at the function but trustworthy\nfriends told me that there were at least one hundred\npeople there. Therefore all this adds up to a substantial\nincome. So surely (as the JCR is free to hire) we must\nsearch for the money in Swiss bank accounts?\nWhy hasn't the Union or the OSC made a sufficient\nenquiry on this matter. Or are they afraid of losing\nface? Or did Bhartendu's ego write cheques his\nsociety couldn't cash?\nYours,\nAnil Loadwa, Mech Eng 3.\nWhat?\nDear Dave,\nI feel compelled to write to you to answer the letter\ntitled 'Obscure' in FELIX last week (issue 860). The\n'ICU sabbatical' mentioned is indeed me, and I admit\nthat the alleged comment is attributable to my very\nlips.\nI bele ive that your correspondent is referring to a remark I made about the behaviour of the former\nRCSU Vice President at the Civil Engineering Freshers'\nDinner. I stand by this statement even today, the\nreason for the letter you received is that I objected\nto being quoted in a motion to an RCSU General\nMeeting without my permission, and on a matter I, incident ly, did not support. Without this clause in the\nmotion the proposer was forced to withdraw it, and\nas such his personal crusade against the former VP\nwas thwarted.\nI am sorry that your correspondent has blighted your\npages with such a pointless, anonymous stab at an\nanonymous victim. The author drinks with me in the\nBar most nights, so I see no reason as to why he could\nnot raise the issue there. Anyway, Captain Cunt here\nis your reply.\nYours,\nDavid Williams, ICU Deputy President.\nSmall Ads ADVERTISE IN THE FELIX SMALL ADS SECTION\nFREE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nANNOUNCMENTS\n\u2022 Postgraduate women: Lunch 12.30pm Friday\n23 Feb.

    "content": "The Diviners\nBuddy Layman is a boy with a genuine gift for\ndetecting water. He can not only find underground\nwater in order to dig wells, he even knows when it\nis going to rain, even though there is not a cloud in\nthe sky. He also has a phobia about water and refuses\nto touch it under any circumstances-even to wash.\nThe villagers all know of Buddy's gift and although\nthey wonder at its accuracy they accept it for what\nit is and indeed make use of it. Apparently Buddy fell\ninto a river when he was five and was under the water\na long time, in fact he almost drowned. His mother\ndied saving him. Both of these incidents have made\na great impression upon Buddy for when he is asked,\nafter finding a well for Basil Bennet, a neighbouring\nfarmer, how h fe detects the water he replies that 'he\njust closes his eyes and thinks of his Mama'. This\nsearch for his Mama and a failure to understand where\nit is that she has gone, or even why, is a recurring\ntheme in the play.\nOne day a stranger arrives in the village looking for\nwork. It is at the height of the depression and Ferris\nLayman, Buddy's father, cannot understand why a man would leave a perfectly good job at such a time.\nHe refuses to employ him until he knows what his\nprevious job was. C.C. is forced to tell Ferris that he\nwas a preacher. Not having had a church or preacher\nfor ten years this news spreads round the town like\nwildfire and from then on C.C. has no peace from\ncertain members fo the community who cannot\nbelieve he has given up preaching.\nBuddy soon makes friends with C.C. who tries to\nhelp him cure his fear of water, if only to help cure\nhim of an everlasting itch which is gradually getting\nworse. C.C. also falls in love with Jennie Mae,\nBuddy's sister, who tries to look after Buddy as well\nas she can in default of their mother.\nNicholas Cannon is excellently cast as the sixteen\nyear old Buddy. He is childlike and simple and very\ncredible in the role. In fact the casting overall is very\ngood.\nThe play is set in Indiana, USA and maybe the cast\nwould have been better to reset the play elsewhere\nor at least not bother with the American accents\nwhich were, in the main, appalling. Richard Hamilton\nas Basil, had the best accent and even this was not\nat all convincing.\nApart from this the play was very enjoyable. The\nplot is original and interestingly dealt with and the play\nis very well written. The acting is good-the casting\nhelped this. This is the second play in the series\n'Women in the Moon', run by the Man in the Moon\nTheatre Club, highlighting the work of women\ndirectors and as with the previous play The Dutch\nCourtesan, very few props are used and very little\nbackground scenery-much of this is left to the\naudiences imagination. Even the ending of this play\nis very powerful leaving a good impression-an\nessential feature of any play.\nThe Diviners is on at the Man in the Moon Theatre\nClub, 392 Kings Road, Chelsea.

    "content": "Touring across America reveals unknown delights.\nOn the road\ngolds of Fall. We also drove round the Finger Lakes,\nsome of which reach forty miles long. The scenery in\nthis area is very reminiscent of Switzerland or Austria.\nApart from the language, it was very easy to imagine\nthat we were in Europe, instead of 3000 miles away.\nThe town of Niagara Falls (on the American side of\nthe Falls proper) is actually a rather tawdry town, with\nlittle to recommend it apart from the beauty of the\nFalls themselves. These are extremely impressive,\neven in the rain, and the boat ride on the Maid of the\nMist has to be one of the most exhilarating\nexperiences open to tourists (you can always go over\nthe Falls in a barrel, a feat which has been survived\nby nine people, but this is only recommended for those\nwho really want to go to extreme lengths to acquire\nexciting holiday tales!). Even just taking the boat ride,\nyou get completely soaked, despite the provided\noilskin s. From Niagara, we then proceeded along the shore\nof Lake Ontario, finishing this stretch of our trip with\nan excursion to Wolfe Island, just over the border into\nCanada. From Cape Vincent, the ferry stopped on the\nUS side, we then drove southwards again, through\nthe Adirondack Mountains, across Vermont, and into\nNew Hampshire. Having about five days left, we\ndecided to try and get back up to the Candadian\nborder by going up along the East Coast. In the end\nwe only got as far as Maine, one of the northernmost\nStates. Despite the tourist traps, Maine is a very\nbeautiful place, with some striking scenery, in\nparticular the Acadia National Park on Mt Desert\nIsland. Once we had looked round there, we had\nregretfully to return to Boston, give up our (very large\nand comfortable) hire car, and return to New York City\nby train. This time, we took the subway to JFK a i port( this being less expensive than a cab!). The subways\nare uncannily like the London Underground, even\ndown to the sudden emergence into daylight halfway\nfrom the city centre to the airport. However, in London\nyou can't see the tops of the skyscrapers from\nHeathrow! Also, the subway trains are air conditioned( which is very welcome) although the stations\nthemselves can get very warm indeed.\nOur flights both ways were on time, and all in all\nwe greatly enjoyed our stay in the United States.\nThere's much, much more to see than we managed\nto, despite the fact that we covered over 2,000 miles\nin our two weeks, and we'd love to go back.\nAnna Stebbings, Chem 3.\nThis summer, I spent two weeks in the United States\nof America, travelling around New England. This was\nas part of a travel award scheme set up by\nInternational Paints PLC. After getting through to the\nfinals of the award process, I was given one of the\nten travel bursa ries awarded this year, in order to visit\nthe Interlux Yacht Finishes plant in New Jersey. The\naward was for one thousand pounds, to cover all\ntravel expenses. In return for this, I had to spend three\ndays looking around the Interlux plant, and on my\nreturn to England write a brief report.\nSo, having made all the necessary travel and\ninsurance arrangements, my boyfriend and I flew out\nfrom Heathrow on Kuwait Airlines, arriving at J F Kennedy airport in New York. Although we arrived in\nNew York at 8.00pm Eastern Standard Time, it was\nof course 1,00am GMT, and it felt like it! We took a cab into Manhattan, where we were going to stay at\nthe Vanderbilt YMCA, This is right in the skyscraper\ndistrict in Midtown but nevertheless quite reasonably\npriced. We stayed in New York for a couple of days,\nand explored Manhattan mainly on foot\u2014the best way\nto get a proper feel for the place, although we did use\nthe subway once or twice. One afternoon, we walked\nall the way from Midtown to Battery Park on the\nsouthern tip of Manhattan, a distance of about four\nor five miles. This was an interesting experience, and\nenabled us to see many different districts and types\nof buildings (some of the 'districts' were as small as\none block, such as a fabric merchants' district).\nFrom New York City, we travelled to Boston by\ntrain, where we were to pick up our hire car (this\nworked out cheaper and more interesting than hiring\na car from an airport in New York). In Boston we also\nstayed in the YMCA, but this wasn't as pleasant as\nthe one in New York. After struggling through the oneway system of central Boston (complete with the old\nLondon favourite of no left/right turns in places), we\nset off across Massachusetts heading for New York\nState, before heading south to New Jersey and the\nInterlux factory. We made the 250 mile trip in one day,\nalthough it was dark by the time we checked in at the\nmotel where we stayed during our time visiting the\nfactory.\nThe Interlux staff were very friendly and\naccommodating, giving us easy-to-follow directions\nas to how to get to the factory in the first place, and\nwhen we were there, giving us a very comprehensive\ntour of the facility. The outfit in New Jersey is not very\nlarge as factories go, as a large part of the\ndevelopment work on new products takes place at\nother locations. This is especially the case when it\ncomes to field testing of new products, and in fact\nthe main function of the New Jersey plant is a manufacturing one. However, the plant did seem very\nefficient, and the staff friendly, making our visit very\nenjoyable.\nAfter seeing the factory, we left New Jersey and\nheaded northwest through New York State to Niagara\nFalls. On the way, we passed through the Catskill\nMountains and National Park-magnificent, wooded\nmountains which were just turning to the reds and\n\n"

They claim light baths\nhave had dramatic effects; one previously suicidal\nwoman is having the best winter of her life using light\nas a drug. More advice from Prof. Reiter; 'Keep the\nbedroom light on...and you should get your old drive\nback.'\n\u2022 The chance of a child developing leukaemia is\nsignificantly linked to the father's exposure to\nradiation. This is according to a report published a couple weeks ago by the Medical Research Council\nconcerning the population in the vicinity of the\nSellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.\nThe present maximum allowed dose for radiation\nworkers is 50 mill is evert s( mSv), although two years\nago the National Radiological Protection Board\nrecommended reducing this to 15 mSv. The report\nconcludes that workers who received more than 10\nmSv six months before conception increased the risk\nof their child contracting leukaemia by six to eight\ntimes.\n\u2022 A film of microscopically grooved plastic could\nmake significant savings in fuel for airlines. The ribbed\nfilm entirely coves an aircraft's fuselage except for\nsharp curves such as the edges of the wings. It has\nbeen tested for a year on an Airbus A300, owned by\nthe airline Lufthansa, and has not been damaged or\nclogged up. The grooves in the film help to lower\ntur bu lance in the layer of air next to the aircraft's skin.\nPredicted fuel reductions are about 1.5%\ncorresponding to 70 tonnes for aircraft on short haul\nflights and 310 tonnes for those on long haul flights\nper year. These represent monetary savings of\n\u00a310,000 and \u00a340,000 respectively.\n\u2022 The European Space Agency (ESA) are trying\nto revive Giotto, a deep space probe. In March 1986\nit met Halley's Comet with an accuracy in tracking\nequivalent to hitting a dinner plate in Hyde Park with\na bullet fired from Edinburgh. It appears that Giotto\nhas survived almost without damage after this\nencounter. Although the probe and its antenna are not\norientated correctly, ESA have been able to make\ncontact and hope to instruct it to re position. It has\nenough fuel to pass close to Earth this June in order\nto send it off into a new orbit to coincide with another\ncomet, Grigg Skjellerup.\nLiz Warren presents an overview of the Process Systems\nEngineering IRC at Imperial.\nSafe simulations\nProcess simulation packages allow designers to model\nprocesses, for example a chemical plant composed of\ndifferent process units. They allow complicated\ninteractions, such as parallel chemical reactions, to\nbe calculated and processes such as startup and\nshutdown to be tested. They also allow on-line control\nand optimisation of plants. Packages can either model\nsteady state situations or they can shed light on the\ntime dependent behaviour of plants. The Chemical\nEngineering Department at Imperial has developed\nsuch a package, known as SPEEDUP, which it has\nmade into a commercial success.\nAny process can be represented on SPEEDUP if it\ncan be written down as a mathematical model.\nSPEEDUP'S main advantage over many of its rivals is\nits ability to handle time dependent equations. It is also\ncapable of dealing with plants in a 'non-sequential'\nmanner, that is, it does not have to know everything\nabout all the previous units in the process as long as\nit has sufficient information overall to solve the\nproblem.\nSPEEDUP has been under development at Imperial\nsince 1979, Initial work was funded by the Science\nand Engineering Research Council (SERC). In 1986,\nProsys Technology of Cambridge, who were already\ninvolved in the simulation market with their own\nprocess database, began marketing SPEEDUP on\nImperial College's behalf. Clients include companies\nsuch as BP and Dow Chemicals. Prosys are now\nresponsible for the commercial development and\n.marketing of the package, while further software\ndevelopment is being carried out at Imperial College\nin the new Interdisciplinary Research Centre (IRC) for\nProcess Systems Engineering, which was set up last\nsummer under SERC funding.\nThe existing SPEEDUP package is already a sophisticated tool. A valuable application is its use in\ntraining plant operators. Plants can be modelled and\nincorporated into other programs, such as a graphical\ninterface. Training modules can then be devised which\nwill allow trainee operators to learn to respond to\nchanges in the modelled plant, such as a variation in\nfeed quality, without losing real products or\nendangering the safety of a real plant.\nSPEEDUP can also assist more experienced\noperators in two ways. It can help operators opt i mise plants on-line by linking the plant's control system to\na model of the plant. The second way in which\nSPEEDUP can help experienced operators is by\nbuilding up an 'expert system', or knowledge base,\nwhich can advise operators on the best course of\naction in particular circumstances.\nCurrent development is progressing in several areas.\nPioneering work is being carried out on generating the\nequations which provide the rigid mathematical\ndescription of the plant from a less rigid description\nsuch as the kinetics of the reaction and physical\nconfiguration of the catalyst in a reactor. The system\nwould build the necessary equations and ask for\nsufficient physical data to solve the problem.\nAnother major area of development is to extend the\nability of SPEEDUP to handle both discrete and\ncontinuous processes within the same model. Most\ncurrent dynamic simulators can handle complex\ncontinuous processes but are unable to model discrete\nevents such as startup and shutdown. Programs\nwhich can handle this sort of event are usually unable\nto model all but the simplest continuous process. The\ncombination of the two types of event in the same\nprogram is increasingly important as the chemical\nindustry places greater emphasis on batch processing.\nA third area in which the system is being developed\nis batch optimisation. This will handle the situation in\nwhich process equipment is used with different feeds\nin varying combinations to produce a range of\nproducts. This can be a complex problem when there\nare a large number of desired products. The system\nwill be able to provide the optimum schedule for the\nbatches to be processed to allow the greatest profit\nto be made. Again the increase in the use of batch\nprocesses stresses the importance of this\ndevelopment.\nDynamic simulators such as SPEEDUP also give\nplant designers several advantages. Many plants are\ndesigned using steady state simulation and this can\nlead to over design and unnecessary cost. Dynamic\nsimulators also allow designers to seriously consider\nthe oper ability of the plant early in the design stage\nand allow them to explore plant control without any\nrisk of accidents. A combined discrete/continuous\nevent simulator also provides the opportunity to\ndesign and test controllers and control strategies.\nDynamic simulators are at last providing design\nengineers with a real opportunity to produce better,\nsafer designs at less cost.\nPage 14\n\n"

    "content": "When I Fall in Love\nReleased originally in the US under the title Everyone's All American, When I Fall In Love is one of those\nmovies that traces people through a good portion of\ntheir lives. Although it is being promoted heavily as\na love story this is but one of the threads of the plot.\nGavin Grey (Dennis Quaidl is a sports hero at\nLouisiana State University. Leading the 1956\nAmerican football team to win the suger bowl, he\nacquires the nickname 'The Grey Ghost'. He goes on\nto play the professional game, pausing only to marry\nhis long term sweetheart, that years Magnolia Queen,\nBabs Rodgers (Jessica Lange). 'Did you ever see two\nmore gorgeous creatures than Gavin Grey and Babs\nRodgers?' fawns a member of the crowd. Over the\nyears they breed like rabbits while Gavin's nephew\nDonnie spends the whole time madly in love with\nBabs. Donnie (Timothy Hutton) has a successful\nacademic career while Gavin's goes down the tubes\nand Babs embarks on hers. All the tensions come to\na head at a college reunion in 1981.\nThe passage of time over the 25 years the film\ncovers is marked in a variety of ways. Very little\nreference is made to real-world events apart from a..'.' Hi. :\nRomero\nperfunctory nod to black right campaigns through the\ncharacter of Narvel Blue (Carl Lumby). Instead we are\ntreated to a wide range of fashions and haircuts on\nMs Lange and variety of style for Hutton too. The\nsoundtrack has also been designed to reflect the\nperiod each scene is set in, with a variety of\n'con tempor y' music used throughout.\nFilm\nFilm\nThe specially filmed football scenes are inter cut with real NFL footage, and so are shot on 16mm film\ninstead of the normal 35mm, giving it a realistic grainy\neffect. Otherwise the camera work is competent but\nuninspired, the most obvious angle being used much\nof the time.\nThe acting is, on the whole, adequate but Quaid\ndoes not turn in a particularly impressive performance,\nmaking Grey seem a very stereotyped person. Hutton\nmakes the most he can of a fairly undemanding part\nand Lange makes a good job of portraying the\n'southern belle with brains' character of Babs. The\nrevelation of the film is John Goodman, who plays a friend of Gavin's. Best known for his portrayal of\nRoseanne Bar's husband in TV's Roseanne, he is both\ncomic and tragic as a man whose life collapses due\nto a gambling and drinking problem-a great\nperformance.\nUnfortunately the film tries to hit too many targets\nand ends up missing them all. It has no real sense of\npurpose and one never really feels that you care for\nthe characters. A very weak and uninspiring film.\nAdam T.IK Romero is a film that succeeds in doing what Oliver\nStone's Salvador failed to do. Romero tells the story\nof El Salvador through the eyes of the one man who\nhas become a symbol of the suffering and hope of the\ntiny Central American republic: Oscar Romero, who\nis portrayed with great sensitivity by Raul Julia. The\nfilm is not without its faults; for example, although\nthe dialogue is in English, many of the characters,\nparticularly the smaller roles, speak with such heavy\naccents and bad pronunciation that it sounds as if they\nare having trouble communicating, rather than simply\ngiving a more authentic flavour to the film, and some\nof the dialogue is a little clich ed. None of this,\nhowever, detracts from the immense power of the\nfilm.\nWhen Oscar Romero is appointed archbishop the\npriests working to make the church more committed\nto the poor are dismayed; Romero is a conservative,\na man whose reality is a world of books and the\ncomfort afforded to El Salvador's elite. When his close\nfriend, Father Rutulio Grande, (who is played by\nRichard Jordan) is murdered by a death squad for\norganising peasants to defend their rights, Romero's Page 4\neyes are opened to the suffering and violence around\nhim. Romero becomes a voice for the voiceless and\nhe comes increasingly into conflict with the\ngovernment and the armed forces. As repression\nincreases against the mass organisations and the\nchurch, Romero is even more outspoken. In his\nSunday homily in the cathedral, Romero orders the\nsoldiers to stop the repression. The film ends the next\nday when, while saying Mass in small chapel, Romero\npays for his commitment with his life.\nRomero is a balanced and moving study of a country\ntorn apart by poverty and civil war. It is also a beautiful\nportrait of a man who undergoes the most painful\nconversion. Romero is, perhaps, an unusual character\nfor a Hollywood film: an overweight, be-spectacled\nand staid archbishop, yet the film shows him, in his\nown way, to be a remarkable hero. The release of this\nfilm, just three months after six priests who worked\nwith Romero were murdered for their commitment to\nthe same cause, makes its impact even more\npoignant.\nJulian Bommer.\nValued\nFriends\nTheatre\nlot of us have experienced the anguish of organising\na flat share. Your so-called friends 'gaz ump' you at the\nlast minute, and you and your pet hamster are left\nwith a luxury apartment for six. But imagine what it\nwould be like if you were to invest 30k of your hard\nearned readies into an Earl's Court Basement with a group of friends one year and the next you find that\nyour loyalties as well your friends' loyalties have\nchanged and that the flat has doubled in price: in most\npeoples' experience, Friends and Money don't mix.\nThis is approximately the scenario in Valued Friends:\nFour ex-students have been living in the same\nbasement for ten years and their new yuppie landlord\ntries to blackmail them into moving out so he can\nredevelop the whole block. They resist and, with a typical sweep of Thatcheresque logic, decide to buy.\nInterestingly, since the play was first performed over\na year ago and interest rates have gone through the\nroof (as it were) the play has been endowed with an\nunintentional twist: 1990 is NOT the time to buy\nproperty.\nWriter Stephen Jeffreys has produced a funny and\nhighly intelligent study of Eighties moe urs.

Keele\nUniversity Student Union (KUSU) has\nwritten to the Rector, Sir Eric Ash, and\nMr Neil McCluskey, IC Union President,\ncomplaining that the publication was\nhighly offensive, but not giving specific\nexamples.\nMr Hal Calamvokis, Rag Mag editor for\nthis year, said that he believed no example\nwas cited as none would stand up to their\ncriticism. He claimed that accusations of\nracism were 'ridiculous' since neither he\nnor his fellow editor, Mr John St Hill,\nwere of British origin. He said that in his\nview the only faintly sexist joke was one\nreferring to women drivers.\nHe said that the magazine went through\na censorship committee comprising of the\n3 Union sabbaticals, the Rag Mag editor\nand chairman, the officer for lesbians and\ngays and it would have contained the\nwomen's officer had there been one at the\ntime. They approved the publication.\nWarwick University have also banned\nthis year's edition and Leicester University\nbanned last year's. Mr David Williams,\nIC Union Deputy President and last year's Rag mag editor claimed that along with\nAston University and the medical colleges,\nIC's Rag Mag is independently produced\nand as such has gained a reputation for\noriginality which is popular with students.\nHe added that this fact irritated other\nUniversities and they probably banned it\nwithout even looking at it.\nMr Williams claimed that any change\nin the style of IC's Rag Mag towards\nconforming with other editions would\ncompromise its selling capability. He said\nthat the purpose of rag mags was to raise\na laugh and raise money.\nThe Deputy President of KUSU said\nthat the rag mag had been banned because\nit was 'racist, sexist, ab list and heteros exist and generally offensive.'

She added that\nthough they had received a reply from the\nRector, no reply had been forthcoming\nfrom IC Union.\nMr McCluskey said he would not\ncomment on the matter until further\ndecisions had been made.\nMSF picket meeting\nH \u2014 i WSBBm .\nm mm\nII\n\u2022\n1111\n\u2022\nOver 100 members of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance (MSF) Union picketed a meeting of the Management ana\nPlanning Group (MPG), the College's highest executive body, on Thursday. The picket was held to highlight objections\nto possible compulsory redundancy for seven MSF members. Chris Stringer and Susan Sharp, IC MSF Chairman and\nSecretary, read a statement to the meeting on behalf of the IC MSF.\nIC MSF were supported by members of the MSF from other universities, including King's College, Queen Mary and\nWestfield College and Manchester University.\nChem Eng in disgrace\nThe Chemical Engineering Departmental\nDinner last Friday was a disgrace\naccording to many who attended it. At the\nevent, held in the Senior Common Room,\nboth academics and students behaved in\na compromising manner in front of the\nguest speaker, Dr Peter Williams of\nOxford Instruments pic.\nAllegations have been made concerning\nthe behaviour of Professor Lester\nKershenbaum towards catering staff\nduring the evening. He denied them\ncategorically. 'It was more rowdy than\nusual,' he said, 'but not excessively so\u2014it\nwould have been nicer if it had been less\nrowdy'.\nMr Rob Northey, IC Refectories\nManager, said that he had 'expressed\ndisapproval' to the department and added\n'I think that senior academics should keep\ncontrol'. He said that the damage that he\nand his staff had to clean up comprised\nmainly of vomit and broken glass and\ncertainly did not add up to \u00a35000 as\nrumoured, but he declined to elaborate\nfurther.\nChem Eng Society has been billed for\n\u00a315 for a turntable broken during the\nevent, and a spokeswoman from Chem\nEng Soc said ' I didn't enjoy the evening\nas much as last year'.\nOther academics in the department have\nexpressed anger over the whole affair, and\nmany Chem Eng first years received an\nadmonitory lecture on the following\nMonday morning.\nProfessor Bill Wakeham, head of the\nChemical Engineering department, is\nrumoured to be very unhappy with both\nthe students and staff involved, but was\nunavailable for comment.\n\n"

    "content": "on campus travel\nWith the vast expansion of the independent travel\nmarket in the past few years, STA has established\nitself as a leader through its use of well-travelled\nconsultants and low-priced, flexible tickets. At the\nULU travel student office we have all travelled\nextensively and as College grad ute s are sympathetic\nto your requirements-the back-up provided by the\nSTA organisation worldwide is second to none, with\nover 100 offices in 20 countries, staffed by multi-cultural, experienced consultants.\nHere at STA we are all encouraged to travel as\nmuch as possible in order to keep our own travelling\nexperiences and knowledge up to date and to ensure\nthat, unlike some other sectors of the travel industry,\nwe do not become divorced from the realities of the\nworld that we live in. Nowhere has this been more\nevident than in the momentous changes that have\nrecently occured in eastern Europe.\nFor a few hardened (and dedicated) western\nStalinists the mystique of the communist bloc has\nalways been a very strong magnet. The disintegration\nof the stal insist orthodoxy in eastern Europe has\ngalvani sed the interest of the public at large, but\nindependent-minded travellers specifically. Even the\nbriefest of examinations would reveal that eastern\nEurope has always had much more to offer than\nstatues of Lenin and collective farms. Within its\nconfines it is possible to discover some of the most\nmagnificent cities to be found anywhere-Prague,\nBerlin and Cracow to name but three-all strangely\npreserved by their en casement for years in a neo-Stalinist order. These countries also boast some of the\nmost spectacular scenery, from the rich forests of\nCzechoslovakia, to the rolling plains of Hungary\n(where one can still get a genuine feel of the feudal\nway of life of the Tartars) to the Carpathian mountains\nCompetition\nof Romania; where mede i val castles mingle with ski\nresorts in a bizarre testament to the privileges enjoyed\nby the communist party elite.\nIt is often difficult to comprehend that all this is\nwithin easy reach, and can now largely be done an\nInter-rail ticket. (Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia and\nCzechoslovakia are all included) even with the\nexpansion of package holidays to such areas as\nYugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania, eastern Europe still\nremains largely unexplored and underdeveloped.\nHowever, this situation is unlikely to remain for very\nmuch longer, especially with the urgent need for hard\ncurrency to shore up delap i dated economies. At STA\nwe have been instrumental in helping to create an\nawareness of travel to this and many other areas of\nthe world not covered in an 18-30 brochure and this\nis something that we intend to maintain. A healthy\ncommitment to travel.\nWhere oh where oh where would you like to go with a free \u00a3100 travel voucher? STA have generously\ndonated a \u00a3100 travel voucher for use on any travel costs booked through them. A weekend away\nor travel abroad could be yours with this prize. The competition will be in three parts, with each section\nbecoming progressively more difficult. This week's questions are:\nWhat is the capital city of Lichtenstein?\nWhat is the capital city of Denmark?\nWhat is the capital city of Finland?\nKEEP YOUR ENTRIES. DO NOT HAND IN ANYTHING YET. THERE WILL BE TWO MORE SETS OF\nQUESTIONS IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. ALL QUESTIONS WILL BE REPRINTED AT THE END OF THE\nCOMPETITION.\nPage 13\n\n"

    "content": "Fencing win UAU final\nLast weekend, Imperial College Fencing Team\nconfirmed their status as Britain's best university\nfencing team by winning the final of the UAU team\nchampionships in a tense, action-packed competition.\nDespite appalling organisation, including lack of\npresidents and electric scoring apparatus, the semifinals eventually started on Saturday, with IC meeting\nancient rivals UCL. From the outset, UCL looked\nshadows of their former selves and were obviously\nin awe of the formidable IC team. The sabre team\n(Jorg, Maurice and Nick) were in good vocal form.\nNext, the foi lists went to work and despite a slight\ncontretemps near the start (resulting from the\npresident not knowing the rules) Peter, Nick and\nSimon Laight brought off a very respectable 6-3\nvictory. With the overall score at 13-5 going into the\ne pee, IC needed only 1 bout for a place in the final;\nwhen it came with the score at 14-6, UCL conceded\ndefeat, meaning that e pee is t Simon Evans did not\neven get to walk onto the p iste. Meanwhile, Bristol\nhad beaten Manchester in the other semi-final and\nwatched us storm to victory with fear in their eyes.\nOn Sunday the organisational fiasco continued:\nfirstly, the sabre president had to be woken up and\ncalled to the venue. Bristol had by then realised that\nthey would have to resort to dirty tricks if they were\nto beat us and insisted at the last minute that the\nmatch be fenced in the order foil-sabre-e pee instead\nof the usual sabre-foil-e pee which had been used in\nthe semi-finals. Naturally, IC captain Dave Matthews\nprotested strongly, but rather than keeping a consistent format, the ineffectual organisers settled\nthe dispute by tossing a coin, which went in Bristol's favour. Thus, our sabre team, who had spent the past\nhour warming up both mentally and physically, had\nto wait around while the foil match was fought. Foil\nwas apparently Bristol's strongest weapon, but IC\nwere more than a match for them, with Peter fencing\nbrilliantly and Gully and Nick also putting in excellent\nperformances. The score in the foil was 6-3 to us as\nthe sabre urs prepared to secure the match. However,\nit transpired that the IC sabre team were not only\ncompeting against Bristol but also against some quite\nappalling judging from the 'neutral' Manchester team.\nDespite spirited performances by Jorg, Maurice and\nNick, the sabre match rapidly degenerated into some\nsort of sick joke and IC lost 4-5, a disgraceful travesty\nof justice and fair play. This brought the overall score\nto 10-8 and it was left to the e pee is ts to finish the\njob. Could they regain the 'surfin' spirit of last season?\nThe answer was an emphatic 'yes', with Peter again\nfencing to the max and Simon Evans starting to return\nto form just when he needed to. Nick Hills completed\nan extraordinary 3-weapon performance as he stuffed\nin an aggressive p rise de-fer action to win the decisive\nbout, driving the IC team wild and making the Bristol\nteam suddenly very silent. The eventual score in the\ne pee was 6-3, making the overall result 16-11.\nCross Country\nThe London Colleges League reached its glorious\nclimax in a10 km road race in Battersea Park. After\nan astounding early season, the team challenge had\ncrumbled to fall 100 points behind perennial rivals\nOxford Poly, so this time individual performances\nwere the order of the day.\nAs the superior Chaston romped away to his third\nwin in the series, Paul settled for second, waiting until\nthe last 50 metres before opening his legs and\nshowing his behind to the ailing Thames Poly man.\nThis assured him the overall individual title by just two\npoints and sealed a stunning debut season for the bio-mathematician. Always plugging away in the chasing\ngroup was Dave Flannel, who found it harder to\nfunction on this unnatural surface, but nevertheless\nSailing\nIC Men's& Ladies v Manchester\nIC Men's& Ladies v London\nOn Saturday Feb 24, Manchester travelled down to\nNorth London to race against Imperial and the\nUniversity of London. Manchester are at the head of\nthe northern BUSA league for both men's and ladies\nand showed a very high standard of sailing.\nImperial raced Manchester men first and due to a bad start by Imperial, Manchester sailed into first and\nsecond place. Tactical sailing by Imperial blocked their\nthird boat from gaining the third place until the last\nleg, when superior sailing by the Manchester men's team allowed them to win 1-2-3.\nImperial then went on to race Manchester ladies.\nThis time Imperial started well, gaining first, third and\nfourth places, good team racing then allowed Imperial\nto pull up to 1 -2-4. However catastrophic gear failure\nled to a collision at the first mark causing 2 boats to\nretire. This led to Imperial winning 1-2.\nRacing was then abandoned as gusts in excess of\n20mph were leading to an unacceptable amount of\ngear failure.\nPage 16\nfound the strength in the later stages to pull up to\n24th, and secure tenth in the overall individuals.\nPride was at stake lower down the field, as Bill\nSkailes, Jim Watson, Ian Williams and Dan McQueen\nenjoyed another close scrap. It was Bill who gasped\nhis way up to 56th, leaving the other three to finish\nwithin 20 seconds of each other and all in the top 70.\nWith the track campaign now about to begin, we look\nforward to stuffing the opposition more thoroughly\nnext autumn.\nNone of this was possible without Alex Gaskell and\nFrank Dudbridge, whose contribution the club\nacknowledges. While they organised just about\neverything going this year, we look forward to them\nactually participating in some races in the future.\nBoat Club\nOn Saturday 17th the IC first eight taught the\nCambridge Blue Boat a lesson in head to head racing.\nCambridge had ventured down to London for their first\npre-boat race warm up and challenged IC to two eight\nminute races. The first race ended after five minutes\nwhen the crews collided, the second race saw IC gain\nan early lead and although Cambridge challenged hard\nthey were never able to get back on terms and IC took\nthe spoils.\nOn Saturday 24th the Boat Club travelled to\nNottingham for its first competition of the year. With\nsix members at Great Britain trials, the men were\nslightly under strength but still managed three\nvictories. The 1st four smashed all before them to win\nthe overall race by a considerable margin. The second\nand third fours also recorded easy victories in their\ndivisions. For the novice men this was their first taste\nof racing and they were extremely unlucky to lose by\nonly one second. The new found strength of the\nLadies Boat Club was in evidence during the race, they\nperformed well above expectations and scored a notable victory over Oxford.\nWu Shu Kwan\nLast Sunday, Wu Shu Kwan held a grading in the\nUnion gym. A large number of Kung Fu students took\npart, many of whom were beginners going for their\nfirst belt. The standard displayed was excellent\n(particularly by our own club), with some powerful,\ngraceful forms and exciting sparring. The event went\nwell and the club expects a very high pass rate.\nBadminton\nUAU Semi-Finals, York 1990\nLast weekend the Imperial men's2 nd team travelled\nto York University for the UAU semi-finals. After a successful qualifying competition in which both the\nfirst and second teams qualified as group winners, the\n2nd team were drawn at home against Nottingham,\nwho had been the victors at the same stage the\nprevious year. It was always going to be a difficult\nmatch but the fact that IC's3 rd pair weren't up to\ntheir usual standard only served to exaggerate this.\nThe top pairing of Punit Khare and Tim Bartle managed\nto win all their 3 rubbers although there were a few\ndangerous moments against Nottingham's very\ncompetitive 3rd pair. The score was level at 4-4 and\nso attention was focused on the final rubber and after\nmuch doubt Carl Edwards and Jin Yee Urn won a close\ncontest to secure a quarter-final place against Cardiff.\nThis proved a somewhat easier task with everyone\nperforming well and the stalwart Tim and Punit again\ncontributing to the overall score of 6-3.\nIn the semi-final stage they played Leeds, the\nholders and overall strongest badminton playing\nuniversity in the country. The IC team of Tim and\nPunit, Carl and Jin Yee and Julian Jenggi and Patrick\nKhoo made the long journey with high spirits, but\nunfortunately these were not to be realised. Despite\nmany extremely close rubbers, Leeds were winners\nby 8-1, although it is fair to say that the final score\ncould have been considerably closer than that. It was\nunfortunate that IC's involvement in the tournament\nshould end at the semi-final stage. We are convinced\nnext year we can go at least one better.\n\n"

Having seen the results of the College's attempts to get work done by external contractors,\nI strongly doubt the merits of such a privatisation. The\nCollege has a serious cash-flow problem and often has\ndifficulties paying its bills on time. This must have a strong influence on the overpriced, shoddy work\nwhich is performed by private contractors around the\ncollege.\nI believe the College is in for a rough ride with the\ntrade unions, which will not improve as the pennies\nare f uther pinched each year.

    "content": "Born on the Fourth of July\nA filo fax is a popular contraceptive. On the same lines,\ncalling a film starring all-american Tom Cruise Born on\nthe Fourth of July is enough to put anyone off their\npopcorn. Trite highschool dances, Ultra-Brite teeth\nand those good 'ole Independence Day Parades: At\nfirst sight it reeks of Jingoism.\nBut this film is really about the American Dream and\nJingoism, turned sour.'Tom Cruise plays small-town\nboy Ron Kovic who, after highschool, for the want of\nsomething better to do, joins the Marines. 'There's nothing finer, nothing prouder than to be a United\nStates Marine', he's told. This is a debatable assertion\nat the best of times, but at the beginning of the\nVietnam War....\nRon survives in Vietnam for two years, witnessing\nand even committing varied atrocities until he is near\nfatally wounded and is sent home, paralysed from the\nchest down. This is where the real fight begins: As\na 'vet', Kovic returns to a country that doesn't feel\nproud about him, as he was once lead to believe, but\nfeels sorry for him. He also finds out that he has been\neffectively sterilised: Will I ever be able to have\nchildren', he asks, 'No, but we have a very good\npsychologist.' His fight is to create a new life for\nhimself when that of his youth has been shattered\nbeyond repair.\nOliver Stone (also director of Platoon) has produced\nan intelligent and mercifully non-sentimental film\nwhich is bound to outshine all the other Vietnam Films\nthat the distributors have imposed upon us recently.\nStone collaborated with the real Ron Kovic (the film\nis his life story) on both the screenplay and on location\nmaking the proceedings startlingly realistic. At 2hrs25 mins, it is not a short film; but to compensate this\nthe range of characters and situations employed\ncoupled with the imaginative photography is more\nthan sufficient to hold one's attention.\nPerhaps the most startling thing about Born on the\nFourth of July is Tom Cruise. His portrayal of the lead\nrole was utterly convincing and was of a quality that\nfew young actors can attain; definitely worthy of his\nOscar Nomination and he alone is worth the price of\nyour ticket. Tom, we all love you.\nBom on the Fourth of July opens today.\nAdrian Pagan\nTrop belle pour toi F Dad\nBernard, a young successful businessman, is happily\nmarried with a beautiful house, beautiful car, two\nbeautiful children and an arrest ingly beautiful wife,\nFlorence. Suspecting an infidelity with his secretary,\nshe bursts in on him at work, but upon beholding the\nplainness of her imagined adversary she dissolves in\ntears of relief: what attraction could a woman hold,\nwhose form can barely be distinguished from the\noffice furniture which surrounds her? Nonetheless the\naffair develops, and the subsequent shock-wave\nthreatens to wipe out not only his own marriage, but\nthose of his circle of friends.\nTrop belle pour toi is a wonderful mix between\nsparkling parable and comic tragedy. Florence, who\npleads to be accepted as an equal, is an icon of\nbeauty. Her life of endless admirers has not equipped\nher to comprehend that at heart she is, as she desires,\ncompletely ordinary. Colette (the secretary) however\nhas led a quiet life untroubled by the attention of\nothers. Those few who pause to look into her eyes\nand wonder what lies beyond, are by nature very\ndifferent. They are the. sensitive vulnerable ones.\nThe director Bertrand Blier, who also wrote the\nscreenplay, clearly enjoys confounding expectations.\nHis clever use of inter cuts allows, without loss of\ndirection, the various stages of the plot to meld into\none more concise whole. He also enjoys several\ncinema to graphic jokes aimed at American cinema\namong others, but you will have to stay awake to\ncatch them. All three main actors (Josiane Balasko,\nCarole Bouquet and Gerard Depardieu) give superb\nperformances, though Josiane Balasko's portrayal of\nthe dumpy secretary is particularly magical. Her\nsensuous love scenes reflect her ability to transcend\nphysical limits, showing us a character rich in both\nemotion and compassion.\nIn conclusion Trop belle poi toi is a love story, but\none which is neither formulaic nor overly sentimental.\nIt well deserves the special jury prize that it won at\nCannes in '89 and will lift the soul of all but the most\nhardened pessimists.\nTrop belle poi toi opens at Chelsea Cinema, The\nLumiere and Camden Plaza tonight.\nMatthew G Johnson.\nWell we've had the thirty something s and their babies,\nso now its time for the thirty something s and their\nparents. John Tremont (Ted Danson of Cheers\nnotoriety) is a successful businessman who is too\nbusy to visit his parents much of the time. All this\nchanges though when he hears that his mother has\nhad a heart attack. Dropping everything he flies to his\nparent's home. There he finds his father a sorry\nsight-barely able to care for himself, reduced to\nsenility by inactivity. John decides to devote himself\nto restoring his father to health, growing closer to him\nin the process. Then Dad himself falls ill...\nThe film tries to mix comedy and drama, and in that\naim it is largely successful. Some of the scenes\nbetween John and Jack Tremont (Jack Lemmon) are\ngenuinely moving although, to be honest, they can get\njust a little too sentimental at times. The comedy is\nalso good, especially a scene in which Bette (Olympia\nDukakis) is talking to her son about her sex life, and\nJohn can't believe his ears. Unfortunately they rarely\nmanage to blend the two, tending to alternate\nbetween them with depressing regularity.\nAlthough the impressive cast do their best, they are\nstruggling against a badly constructed script. John\nseems to be able to take unlimited time off from his\njob, Jake falls ill and gets better rather too frequently\nto be believable and the whole thing seems overlong.\nWhat could have been a good study of the relationship\nbetween parents and children has not been kept under\ntight enough control, leaving the film to meander\naimlessly, obscuring the point. A nice first attempt\nfrom producer Goldberg, better luck next time.\nAdam T. Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Charles English describes his trip to the Sahara last year.\nNomads on wheels\nThere was a time when the trade routes across the\nSahara were used by Tuareg nomads, working the\nimmense salt-caravans between such mythical places\nas Niane, Djene and Timbuktu. Today, though, much\nhas changed. The sons of the salt-traders who\ncrossed and re crossed the desert in caravans of up\nto 60,000 camels that would go from Northern\nAlgeria, to Timbuctou and Niger and back again are\nnow more likely to be seen racing a Toyota Land\nCruiser around downtown Tamanrasset. But little of\nthe Tuareg mentality has changed, only the means\nwith which he accomplishes it. Hoary dromedaries,\ngargling and spitting their way between nomad\nsettlements have been supplanted successively by\nLand Rovers, and now by the more reliable Toyota\nLand Cruisers that fly past on sand tyres cobbled\ntogether with string. The swaying salt-caravans have\nbeen swapped for Berliet and M*A*N trucks,\nsteaming through the sand with a tail of dust flying\nup behind like some fantastic al sand-borne\ncombine-harvester.\nInto this clash and fusion of cultures has come a new ethnic minority; the white man. In days of yore\nthe European tourist would be regarded as an alien,\nof immense wonder and excitement, to be treated as\npublic property to be examined, experienced and\ndigested by the group. But now he is commonplace;\na symbol of wealth, a source of money, spare parts,\nand BIC bir os. There is much so-called 'tourism' here\nnow, though the 'tourists' do not think of themselves\nas such. To most, 'Tourism' implies Benidorm or the\nCosta Brava. 'Explorers' is more like it, doing battle\nwith an unknown and dangerous desert-yet to the\ntribesmen they take things very easily, sticking to the\nmain routes and drinking too much water.\nAmong these exists the new breed of Saharan\ntraders. These are tough, young Europeans, many\nGerman, in search of an adventure on the cheap. Their\nroutes are usually traditional, taking either the fast,\nflat and empty p iste across the Tanezrouft, or the\nmore interesting road across the Hoggar mountains.\nTheir transport and merchandise, though, have\nchanged and been rolled into a single entity: a secondhand Peugeot or Mercedes. These cars can be\nbought in France or Germany, or indeed the UK, for\nfour or five hundred pounds, repaired a little, and\ndriven across the desert where they are highly prized\nby wealthy and enterprising Nigerenes. Their sale can\neasily cover the cost of petrol, food and the flight\nhome. For most it can provide them with an invaluable\nand free holiday; for some, drivers of almost new\nMercedes 190s and the newer Peugeots, it has been\ndeveloped into a profit-making business. Sales of such\nvehicles are usually arranged in advance, the\npurchaser is often an agent for some rich and powerful\n'patron' behind the scenes.\nThose taking a car, however, should be very\nselective as to make and model. Secondhand\nPeugeots pretty much have the market cornered in\nWest Africa. Spares and mechanics are hard to come\nby, so any car other than the ones that are well known\nand for which parts can be salvaged from the scrap\nheap are of little value unless a complete set of spares\nis brought with them. Also, the more 'wide boy' the\nimage, the more valuable the car becomes. Stickers,\nmetallic paintwork and anti-static strips will all\nincrease the value of a car to be sold. It is perhaps\na bitter irony that the car-sticker proclaiming 'Turbo'\nwill increase a vehicle's value hugely in Niger, a country with a90.2% illiteracy rate.\nFor those making the long, dust ry drive South, Niger\nis a promised land, the end of the heat and strain of\nthe desert. Here spare parts can be obtained, cheap\nbeer can be bought, fresh mangoes can be found in\nabundance. Deep in the tropics, it is in the south of\nNiger that the dense greenery begins. Yet further\nSouth is the edge of the tropical rain forest. Like a vast\nexperiment, humid and steaming, it is a place of\nsuperlatives; spiders are the biggest, snakes the most\npoisonous, fresh fruit the tastiest and diseases the\nmost virulent. Everything from elephants to malarial\nmosquitos to greenery grows faster and larger than\nin more temperate climates.\nMost, but not all, make it. The track South of\nTamanrasset to Assamakka is littered with burnt out\nshells of Peugeots and VW buses that have broken\ndown or even exploded, usually as a result of storing\npetrol cans on the roof in the sun. This is not often\nterminal as the next passing truck usually has room\nfor a couple more passengers, or at least enough\nwater to spare. Yet still some tourists die almost every\nyear. At the Algeria/Niger border of In Guezzam this\nyear are four Peugeots ail-but covered over by the\ncreeping dunes. They had belonged to a group who\nhad decided to skip customs on leaving Algeria to save\nthemselves some cash, avoiding the main track past\nthe border point and taking a diversion some 30 miles\nto the West. All four had variously broken down or\nbecome stuck in the sand. They sat and waited for\nhelp to come for two weeks, maybe less, in the end\ndrinking the water in the radiators of their cars. But\nno one came until too late, and the Peugeots have\nsince been brought to the border post. Sinking slowly\ninto the sand, they recall hauntingly the desert's slow,\nalmost gentle ir resist ability. Charles English.\n\n"

    "content": "The Telescopes, Kitchens of Distinction, New\nFast Automatic Daffodils and the Chairs\n-ULU 22.2.90\nThe Chairs, who knows, nobody else bothered to turn\nup either; they probably got sat on.\nThe New Fast Automatic Daffodils sounded\nuncannily like The Happy Mondays. Not only because\nthe lead singer, Andy Stearpoint, is a Mane, but\nbecause of the tom-tom drum beat leading the near\noratory vocals over a field of wavering, w hinge ing and\nnear pointless guitars, down a track to jollity and\nmindless dance music. They even brought along their\nown Bez, who played the toy drums with his hands\nfor a couple of tracks and just bugger ed off for the\nothers; no-one minded, he just made up the numbers.\nTheir set was fast, furious and almost fun, not quite\nThe Happy Roses, but the Manchester attitude was\nin there somewhere, calling for 'Scallies of the world\nto unite,' and they did.\nNow, Scallies are misguided and harmless sorts,\nwho could even pass as trendy in down-town\nManchester or perhaps bopping away in the Hacienda,\nbut, at a gig where slam dancing and stage diving are\nthe norm, they're so out of it that it makes them far\nmore entertaining than the New Fast Automatic\nDaffodils (that's not saying much). To see a Scallie\nstage dive is reminiscent of a kite, flares flapping in\nthe wind, and to see a Scallie try to slam dance is\nreminiscent of a total dick head. Onward to the Kitchens of Distinction was a definite\neasterly move.\nWhile the singer sings songs with bitterness from\na moral and political stance which can most easily be\nlikened to Morrissey, the guitarist is on another planet,\nentirely alone but observed by droves of bemused\nfans. He dances around the stage, a victim of far too\nmany rock videos in his youth, the stage is his, well\nwhat's left after the vast floor space taken up by a multitude of effect pedals.\nThey came to ULU from outer space, fresh from a European tour and played an excellent set for thirty\nminutes, with strong feelings and striking lyrics,\nbacked by a manic guitar sound, pummeled through\nnumerous effect pedals, giving a totally unnecessary\nsound.\nEach song relied on the bass and vocals to carry it\nthrough, as the guitarist and his hyper-active ankle\nleapt around from effect to effect, seemingly\nrandomly, but all with the same overall useless effect.\nThe most popular songs (though still not down on\nvinyl) were The Third Time They Opened The Capsule\nand Prize, which carried to the whole audience (and\ncost less than a pound of bananas). They were both\ndance able for the straggling Scallies and new-found\nfans on the dancefloor and still sounded excellent\n(really it did, to some of us), to the more reserved\nhugging the walls and up on the balcony.\nThe band are now heading studio wards and won't be touring again until May. Let's hope they realise how\nfraudulent and useless the guitar sound is before\ncontinuing or eating any more Creme Eggs.\nThis is going on for ev aaaaaa a....aaaaa argh! The Telescopes were pretentious wan kers and were\ndragged through a brilliantly irate and moody set by\nlead singer, Steven (or was it Jim Reid), for thirty\nminutes until finally the illusion they had constructed\nself-destructed.\nSongs like The Perfect Needle and Anticipating\nNowhere were fiercely mellow whereas Violence and\nThere is no Floor threw the crowd into a fierce mosh\nfuelled by Steven's strangled and screamed vocals.\nThough moshi ng was limited by the sweat box atmosphere of ULU; wot no ventilation? The idea to\nturn the house lights on for five minutes during the\nset was a bit of a scorcher too!\nWhen someone spat at Steven it was the final\nstraw: 'A pound of carrots please Mr Jones the\nGreengrocer,' said Steven. 'We're not gonna play\nanother song, until that fuckin' w anker who spat at\nme gets up here.' Who did he expect Sparticus or\nMeteoric Telescope Attack\nperhaps Mr Jones the Greengrocer. A tortured version\nof To Kill a Slow Girl Walking ended the set and they\ndidn't come back.\nAt a glance they were The Jesus and Mary Chain,\nthey have the same attitude (problem). Their sound\nhas more direction and ebb and flow, in and out of\nguitar spurred frenzies, never does a sense of\nconsistency or conformity fall upon a track. But each\ntrack ultimately depends on Steven's tempestuous\nmoods.\nOoh, Steven we love it when you get angry, go on\ndo it again.\nDel, the whole Del and nothing but Del (except\nthe crap photos), so God help us.\nKitchens\nTHE GREENGROCER'S GUIDE TO\nDOMESTIC FRUITS\nFriday 2nd March\nCarter the Unstoppable Sex Machine\n+ Senseless Things + Nutmeg ULU\nThe Creatures Town & Country Club\nJames Ray's Gangwar\n+ Asylum Fulham Greyhound\nSpandau Ballet Docklands Arena\nSaturday 3rd March\nColdcut Brixton Fridge\nSunday 4th March\nLoop + Godflesh Town & Country Club\nMonday 5th March\nCud + Flik Spatulata + Barbel Dingwalls\nTears for Fears Wembley Arena\nChicago + Marilyn Snapes Hammy Odeon\nTuesday 6th March\nStrawberry of the Week:\nFelo-de-se...Op. on the Green, Shepherds Bush\nThe Railway Children Subterrania\nWell Loaded Fulham Greyhound\nThe Other Side\n+ Some Have Fins\n+ Spectral Temple Marquee\nTears for Fears Wembley Arena\nWednesday 8th March\nKiwi Fruit of the Week:\nRed Hot Chilli Peppers\n+ Gaye Bikers on Acid Astoria\nPale Saints\n+ The Real People ULU\nThey Might be Giants Powerhaus Islington\nFriday 9th March\nHouse of Love Royal Albert Hall\nRide LSE Student Union\n\n"
