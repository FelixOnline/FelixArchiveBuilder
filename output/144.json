    "content": "CAL US TORR BE Aa Amerioa is the apparent \"leader\"\nof the western world, its sociological\nproblems are ob wi ou sly of interest and\nimportance to its \"followers.\"\nVance Paokard has just recently\nbrought out another book on American\nsoo i ology. His first book, \"The Hidden\nPersuaders\" dealt with his country's methods of motivational advertising while\nhis second \"THE STATUS SEEKERS,\" 21/-,\ninvestigates American class behaviour.\nThere are, as sociologists have\ndiscovered over the whole world, five distinctive o lasses in Amerioa.\nThese are the Real Upper, Semi-Uppen\nLimited Success, Working and Real Lower\no lasses, with a notable cleavage between\nthe top two and the remaining three. This\ncleavage, we are told, is almost entirely to do with e duo ation. This, only\noo lle ge graduates can hope to a oh i eve the\nsuccess required to pit them in the top\ntwo o lasses. Without the help of advanced\ne duo ation one is left struggling against\nan insurmountable barrier. American society is also stratified on racial lines. For instance, a torn\nAmerican Jew or Negro is of much lower\nstatus than a top British American.\nSo Amerioa, w hio his thought to be\nthe most ol as s less so oie ty in exist eno e is, it appears, as class conscious as\nGreat Britain was fifty years ago.\nThis country has been gradually\nlosing its class rigidity in the present\ncentury but it is still evident. If America in flue noes Britain in its attitude\nto status as much as in many other things\nwe shall return to our old ways.\nParadoxioally, the upper classes in the United States tend to oop y old world\nBritain. This stems from the fao t that\nthe early British settlers were of higher\nclass than the other settling nationals.\nThus, an upper ol as s Amerioan striving for status will buy a faded family portrait from an antique dealer and show it to\nguests aa \"one of my British ancestors.\"\nCoach lanterns on the gate-posts and old faulty window panes also give the right impression to visitors. A quis it ion of antiques is not the only\nsymbol of status. Another one, equally\nas potent, is wealth. This has been recognised for Sissi time and is shown by comp let ely unnecessary gadgets, 3u oh as air conditioning, 30 foot television masts\nand larger cars.\nThis ol as s striving has become so\napparent recently that advertisers are\nspending a considerable amount of money\non research to find out 'how to advertise\na pro duo t to make it desirable as a high\nstatus symbol.\nThe main point, however, seems tu oe\nthat the author considers that lower ol as s children do not have sufficient opportunity\nfor higher education and so the natural\ntalent of clever oh il d renin the lower\nstrata.goes to waste due to the rigidity of the class system. He considers that\na modern society cannot afford to tolerate\n3uch waste.\nFELIX\nTn these stories he captures the\nweaknesses and eccentricities of his\ncharacters displaying them with great\nskill in scenes ranging from pathos in one extreme to high comedy in the other.\nThe themes are really a pleasure to\nfind: one, of a poor little weakling of\na man whose life is disrupted by the\nmurder of a prostitute in an adjacent\nflat; another of the bullfight organised\nto raise money for the Spanish R.S.P.C.A.; and yet another of the unhappy Czech\nAmerioan wife, who tries to solve her\nproblem of a frigid husband with the\nassistance of aT.V. psychiatrist. Each story in itself is highly enter-tai ning and the complete product is one\nof the best books of short stories pub-li shed reo ent ly. The author isar radu ate of Pennsylvania State University and has a Masters\nDegree from Columbia. He has worked\nfor a Boston newspaper, the Associated\nPress and several magazines. He became\ninterested in human behaviour early in his career and has published the two books\nmentioned with great success. (The first has already been translated into nine\nlanguages). He has been on several lecture\ntours around Kurope and the U.S.A. and is an associate member of The Amerioan Socio logical Society.\nMr. Packard attacks the present\nol as s system in Amerioa throughout) the book\nand fills it full of intriguing socio logical details ranging from class attitudes\nin sex behaviour to choosing a house. One,\nhowever, is constantly aware of the fact that the author is only telling you about\nthe things wh i oh help his case. He either has tried to colour his book with slight sens at i osi al is m, always quoting the extremes\nfrom his references, or he has tended to\ndiscover only what he wants to di so over. In either case, one oo ul d go to Amerioa,\nand not be able to find a trace of those\nthings which he abhors .\nThe book is written in an easy style, far better than his first book which was\nat rifle ponderous, and if read with reservation is highly entertaining, inform-at ive, and well worth reading.\n\"ADD A DASH OF PITT\" pr ioe15/ is a recently published book of eight\nshort stories by Peter Ustinov.\nSTANDARD REVIEW Up to the time of going to press\nonly three issues of the Evening Standard \"University of London Special\" have\nbeen printed,, yet these and other columns\nhave been filled with tales of cabals,\nIntrigues and the type of political man-o eu ve ring that one gets used to in Union\naffairs. So far I have been disappointed\nthat the criticisms expressed by I.C. students have missed the main point.\nThey are concerned with the fao t that\nlittle mention has been made of I.C.A glance at the issues will show that\nsooner or later we will take our turn in the \"College Close - ups\" on the first page. But to me the whole matter hinges\non whether the supplement is directed towards students or towards the public.\nIf the latter were the oas e then\n\u2022one of us oo ul d have any serious\nobjection. But the course of events\nseems to point to the former. Information on the circulation and distribution of the supplement seems to be\nconfused wh i oh does not surprise me in view ofthe nebulous and evasive answers\nI received from a man who purported to\nbe in charge of the distribution depart-ment. When I asked him whether the is sues were on sale in places other than\nthe College Unions he replied that some\nwere sold in the West End. He refused\nto give the proportions sold to students\nFELIX on the SPOT Onoe again Felix has broken new\nground. As our first photograph shows,\nour renowned Editor has reached the\nbottom at last,accompanied by all the\nFelix staff. Illuminated by a soft ned\nlight,Mike Barron worked late into the\nnight and with each, word the hole he has\ndug for Felix sank deeper. At last,it\nwas ao deep that, only by climbing up alam pos too ul d the bottom be seen. The\nbottom has now disappeared along with s ii members of the Felix staff and one disgusted lam post. What Gad Brough is doing\nno-one seems to know but hopes ran high\nthat he might be, joining the Foreign Legion; but unfortunately this was not so.\nTou,too,can come and work in the Felix\nhole. Contact our renowned Editor,Mr. Troglodyte Barron,Hole 123,Prinoe Consort Rd.\nS.W.7. Telephone No. OLE 759-and to the public Being already somewhat embarrassed by my questions he re-erred, me to Berwick, the Assistant Ma\naging Director of the newspaper, w n of brain child the supplement is. He t.a out and unobtainable.\nIt seems in view of the reticence\nof the Evening Standard that the schema\nis intended primarily to get more students to buy copies, and not to provide ,\n'\nan informative and mature comment on the';!\nUniversity for the general public. In jj f this case we must disagree with the ven-ture. The premature decision already f taken by The King's College Union in support of the supplement and of Spell man was motivated primarily no doubt by\nthe uninspired art iole in the second\nissue which featured them. I fear that\nthe spotlight directed suddenly upon\nthem has so dazzled them that they cannot see the audience before whom they\nstand - not a credulous public but their own university colleagues.\nThe Supplement is so a roe lya threat\nto the college newspapers for I feel that students will quickly realize its worth. It cannot hope to perform the\nfunction of Sennet and it adds nothing\nto the University. Let's keep it outside the gates.\nNorman B. Greaves.\n\n"

    "content": "BOYCOTT Dear Sir. Even if spa oe permitted we would\nnot here try to convince you and your\nreaders of the horrors and inhumanities\nof Apartheid as practised in the Union of\nSouth Africa. Any of them who bother to\nread this letter must by now have their opinions one way or the other.\nBut we find it impossible to\nunderstand those who claim to be anti apartheid and yet seem to be emphatically\nanti-boycott. With one breath they say\nthat the non-European3 should be given\nmore rights and responsibilities, and with\nthe next that they are too irresponsible\nto know what is good for themselves. The\nboycott these people say will only harm\nthe non-Europeans. But surely they themselves are the best judges of any harm that\nthey may suffer and in fact every South\nAfrican non-European organisation of any\nappreciable size has asked us to support\nthe boycott. If you support the underdog\nin his struggle for freedom then when the\ntime comes to show your support in the\nway he asks, so not hide behind excuses.\nAnd one must admit that some of\nthe excuses put forward are somewhat\nludicrous!' \"We cannot boycott South\nAfrican goods because we have not boycotted\nthose from Hungary and China.\" Even if the cases were strictly comparable this is still a negative approach. In the\nSouth African case the suppressed themselves have asked for a boycott, a refusal is a sign of support of the Apartheid and\nBaaskap policies. We therefore echo Hr. Bust's words; there is too much apathy, too\nmuch criticism with action. Here is a chance to sf cow your feelings against\nApartheid. Support the Boycott.\nWe would like to take this opportunity of asking those who are organ-ising the proposed South African Society\nwhen this Society will be holding a meeting to decide policy. We feel sure that\nthere are many more tb ki,t&e75 signatures\nreferred to by Mr. Buet who are actually pro-boycott. After all the aim3 of the\nSociety were stated to be, simply, to\nbring together those students who have\nan interest in South Africa Here was\nno reference to the boycott. Lastly we\nunderstand that the notice was not stolen,\nas Mr. Buet accuses, but removed by the\nS. C.C. Chairman after the time proscribed\nwhich it was his duty to do.\nYours faithfully, C. Aholick\nW.E. Maomillen\nD.B. Kristmanson.\nS.K. Subbaroyan\nJ. W. Smith\nHOW TO BECOME PRESIDENT or\nTo Be or Not To Be\nStudents aspiring to the Presidenoy\nmay care to read the following hints\npicked up from long e ape rien ce at I.C. There are three main methods of\naction, the sportive, the social, and,\nthe most succ e3 ful in recent years, a weighted combination of both.\nLet us take the last one first. The point to remember is that you mustn't be too good at your chosen sp^rt, or if you can't help being good at it, have an\nargument with the management. This will always help by getting the sympathy of\nthe mob. Next, don't be too obvious:\ni.e. never be captain or secretary,\nbecause you' ll tread on a lot of peoples*\ntoes and probably finish up by not wanting\nto be President anyway. Lastly, don't drink too much beer, your oj m or anyone\nelse^a. This leads to exclusion from\nI. C.W. A*, the surest way to social success\nin this College.\nOn Thursday, 4th. Feb., it is supposed that the newly-formed Beer and\nSong Society had an emergency general\nmeeting in order to amass forces against\nthe motion devised to poke into their paunchy sanctuary. The I.C. Debating\nSociety, under the delightful chairwoman ship of Miss Tompsett, had the\nmotion that 'this house believes that all members of the union and their guests\nshould be allowed into the I.C. bar,'\nbefore it, and sparks were expected.\nJohn Cox, proposing, gave a fine display of brinkmanship, ineffectively reviewing everything from apartheid to\nto-morrows 'Worker' editorial. J. Carter,(Jim, in case you don't know)\nopposing, tossed out a selection of his more contained jokes, resorting to his well\nworn technique of never talking to the\npoint. \"You come here with a pre-determine<\nmind, in any case, not really to listen to mej\" Perhaps some principal speakers\nat I.C. will some day realise that most\npeople attend debates in order to hear\nthe principal speakers speak tei the motion,\nIn the social sphere, you must always\nbe ready to accept offers of coffee,\nespecially from I. C.W. A. This is most\nimportant. It is not necessary to give\ncoffee yourself, or even to drink the\nfilthy stuff in your own room, but never,\nnever, refuse an invitation. I. C.W. A., realising their position as arbiters of\nsocial success, and having the casting\nvote, as it were, in the Presidential elections, will damn you out of hand if you. refuse to be bored over coffee, or\ntry to be independent. So, make a lot of rather superficial friends among our\nwomen, but don't on any account fallin love with one. This gives rise to,\nwhat might be politely termed, differ en ces of opinion, on the third floor. Now for the sporting method.\nThere is only one way to make a success^\nful attempt in this manner, and that is to be a Rugby Club character, par ex cell ance. In this way, you make hundreds .\nof enemies, but also hundreds of drunk e ji buddies who will say \" It's about time\nwe had a decent blok e as President, in stead of this lousy shower of - \". The\n- indicates some suitable epithet. A feeling then arises among the sportsmen\nthat something mu3t be done, and abusive\nattacks are made on Council, from which\nyou of course, stand aloof. You then\nbecome accepted as a natural candidate\nby the boozers, and the only reasonable\nboozer by the hoi poll oi. This could\nwork well, but has not, I believe, been\nsuccessful.\nLastly we come to the social tech-ni que, this is the most difficult of\nthem all, and requires a lot of nerves,\nguts, and the ability to speak in debates. I would not suggest this method to anyone except an obvious\ncandidate.\nNow you know how to become Presi*>\ndent, and if you succeed, you can look\nforward to a year of absolute hell, be o a use those who wanted to be President\nin your year, those who want to be\nPresident ilex t year, a motley collection of stirrers, and your Supervisor, will all-combine to make you look an idiot. Coed luck friends, you need it. The second speakers wen. .\n.\n. higher\nthan usual standard and thoughts returned to/ the gay bit of fluff delicately skipping\nover the body-strewn floor for daily Guinness , The floor speeches were\nspasmodic, fao es tending to the - \"Whose\nrou hd next?\" - expression. The ex-Bresident of Debates, rejoicing in his newly found ple bian freedom, shed his apathy, and twice attempted to add a touch\nof class to the proceedings, with some\nsuccess it must be added. In the final speech, John Cox returned to his more\nusual form, and added a touch of serious-ness, which might have caused one or two\npeople, to think carefully of their own\nposition, if not of the motion. All in all, a disappointing debate, rarely reaching the standards that one should\nexpect from this College of Science and\nTechnology. The motion, by the way, was\ndefeated, with more,abstentions than votes\nfor.\nNICE ARROWS? BY I CW A. for the election of Mr ICWA 1960\nThis will take place on\nFebruary 29th. A list of\nprospective candidates for this, meritorious post is on the\nmain Union notice board. Proposers will be expected to ext oll the s pe oi al virtues, or\notherwise, which befit their candidates for the post, before\na full meeting of the Association. This will be followed\nby an absolutely democratic\nplebiscite after which the\nsuccessful candidate will be\nelevated with due pomp and ceremony to the chair of office.

    "content": "EXPLORATION WEEK* FEM X, Last week, Mr, Oheeney's excellent\nposters told us, was Exploration Week at\nImperial College. Now it's all over we\ncan look back and ask ourselves why. Why\nhold an exhibition? Why publish a review?\nThe reas to i3 are several. First and perhaps foremost, is that we've had a large\nnumber of expeditions in reo ent years,\nsome of them bad, some mediocre but most\nof them good. Not many people realised what had been done on these expeditions\nand so the Exploration Week gave them a chance to learn. In addition to this many firms and sections of industry had\nsupported these expeditions, both fina noi ally and in kind, and th ds was their chance too, to see the results of their support. A third, and equally good reas-on, is that if the present high standard\nof exploration at Imperial College is to\ncontinue, new blood and ideas must enter\nthe field from outside, and new people\nbecome interested.\nThe exhibition was opened by the\nRector on Monday and, despite the railway\nstrike, about twenty representatives from\nfirms attended the opening. At the opening the Rector announced that he had received a telegram of best wishes for the\nExploration Week from the present contingent of five I.C. men at present with\nF.I.D.S. in the Antarctic. A very\nthoughtful and timely gesture.\nTo coincide with the exhibition, a publication, \"The I.C. Exploitation Review\"\nwas brought out. The editor, Nigel Clark,\nand his staff are to be congratulated on\nthe high standard of thi3 review, especially as none of them had had any previous\nexperience of publication.\nOn Tuesday and Thursday at lunchtime\nOr, Cott and Mr. iX in can Carse lectured on\nAfrica a nfl the Antarctic respectively.\nBoth lectures were beautifully illustrated and were generally enjoyed.\nThe ''IxplOBation Society Dinner was\nheld on Wednesday, and it was pleasing to see that quite a number of people brought\nguests.\nFinally, what was the general impression of the week? Host people seemed\npleased with the exhibition, and many\npeople from outside seemed to have at t ended. Five hundred copies of the review\nhave been sold, and the lectures wer s quite well attended. In all, the reaction\nhas been encouraging.\nMOTORING FOR THE SPECIALIST The Institute of Advanced Motorists\nwas formed three years ago, with Government help. Its aim was to improve the\nstandard of driving in this country by\nmeans of tests and lectures. At present\nit tests about 8.000 people a year, of\nwhom about 50 per cent pass. The Institute also organizes social and sporting\nr vents for its members.\nDuring the three years, the Insti tut e's tests have received much publicity and the standard is generally accepted to\nbe very high. It is not considered ad is grace to fail. Application for a test\nis i a de on a form provided by the Institute, which includes questions on driving experience, age, occupation and type of\ncar, etc. The fee is \u00a32 but a further \u00a31\nhas to be sent with this as a year's subs cri pti on for membership. A test is usually arranged about 6 to8 weeks after the form i3 received.\nI arrived for my test rather\nnervously because not only had a lot of people taken an interest in my\nbeing tested, but my car was 3 years older\nthan T and lacked many of the improvements\na modern car has. The examiner met me\nand introduced himself, lie w nr ned me that\nthe test would cover all types of road\nbut that there would be no \"catches.\" He\nexpected a very high standard of driving but said he would not ask questions on\nthe Highway Code, although I must not\nbreak any of its rules. After this brief introduction we\nmoved off. Immediately he gave me a very steep hill3 tart. I managed to do this quite well and.acquired some\nconfidence. The route was over about\n35 miles of mixed roads, in heavy and\nlight traffic. The examiner gave very\nclear instructions as to the route and\nwe started to discus s the relative merits\nof different makes of cars. He did not\nonce mention my driving although he often\ncriticized the driving of other road users\nwe saw. He commented on the good condition\nof my car, saying that if all cars had as\nmuch attention paid to them as mine, there\nwould be fewer accidents.\nLater he asked me to give a running\nco:,ment6 xy on my th ouc;h t3,wh i oh was rather\ndifficult. Luckily I had expected this and practised a little before. I remembered to mention the traffic conditions\nbehind and well in front and to can ment on pedestrians. After about two minutes\nhe said I could stop. This was the hardest\npoint of the test as I tended to think at\nthe same rate as I was talking.\" \u00bb\n'\n/\ne finished back at the starting point\nafter about an hour and a half, and he\nthen criticized my driving. I had been\nover cautious., but this was probably\nbecause I was under test. I had to realize that the Institute required a very high standard and it was no disgrace\nto fail. However, I had passed i! He went\non to compliment se me points of my driving and said that my tech ni jue on roundabouts\nwas the best he had seen for a long time.\nI was very surprised to have passed because I made mistakes on the test that I do not normally make, but he must have\nput these down to nerves.\nThis summer my father took the test\nand passed. He then suggested that I should take it and volunteered to pay\nfor me. He wished to show, by my pass-ing, how low the standard really was. I had been driving for only 3 years, and,\nhe claimed, could not have reached a very high standard. Because I wis free\nto accept a test at any time of day\ndu ri,g the next month, I was able to fix an appointment within three weeks\nof malting an application.\nAt one point he asked me to describe\nthe la3t road sign passed, obviously to\ncheck on my observation. I replied that\nI was not sure, but expected that it w. as\na \"Road Harrows\" sign, because the road\nhad just reduced in width and T was taking\ncare to give room to vehicles coming the\nother way. He seemed quite satisfied. With this reply. Later he asked me to\ndo two special tests. The first was to\nturn the car round in a very harrow road;\nhe told me afterwards th rt he wished to\nsee if I knew the size of my car and did not let it hit the kerbs. The other was\nto reverse round a small triangular island\nwhich was on a steep slope, and to keep\nas close in as possible the whole way rand .\nI had. to finish with the oar parked by the\nker b facing up the hill. The test has had no real effect on my\ndriving. Immediately after passing I drove very cautiously as I felt the\n\"Hesponsibllity\" of being an \"Advanced\nMotorist.\" However, this phase 300n wore\noff and I drove nor l ally again, I now\nno longer try to prove myself a good\ndriver, but Jet my friends look at the\nbadge on the front of my car instead.\nThe fact that I passed, not only proves\nmy father's point that the standard of\nthe test is not so high, but as half\nthe candidates that take the test fail, the general standard of driving on the\nroads to-day must be very low.\n\n"

WE\nWe are to blame,of course. That you, the\nUnion, did practically nothing worth printing; that you WROTE p rao tio ally nothing\nworth printing; that you presumably had\nnothing worth writing; all these are minor\"\npoints compared with our dreadful error in producing a Felix, wh i oh in your es tim ation,\"wasn't up to standard.\"\nBut while you crumbled, even then you\ndid not bother to ;>ick up a pen and say,\n\"I think that such and such an article is st n pid. Why not ?\" We can only presume that you are far busier than is good\nfor you, or that you are scientists of the\ntype referred to by the eminent Sir Bruce\nWhite. \" Scientists should be on tap, not\non top.\"\nFelix is the pulse of student opinion.\nWe would only be too pleased to print your\nviews, and you ought to be able to read\nothers. As it is, the only views you ever\nread are those of the Felix board, to get he i with the handful of outside (Hostel) stal warts; because these are the only people\nwho ever write to Felix. The decline of the power to write\namong scientists is a grave ill. The profession has never been noted for its or at ors; thus literature is its best way of\nself expression. Now, when the scientist is of more importance to the world than\never before, he is becoming inarticulate, apart from the limited perfection he can\nachieve in his so called specialised tech-n ical papers and reports. The reasoning\nvo ioe of the scientist, the man who knows,\nis seldom heard in the clatter and babble\nof political fury which sweeps over the\nworld; but a tI.C. it is different. The\nauthorities, if they are wise, pay attention to the will of the students. The\nWILL of the students oo ul d be expressed\nthrough Felix. That is why it exists. If you pay your four pen oe every\nfortnight, that helps to keep Felix independent. We are not sub sidi sed, \u2022md we are not obliged to print a uv thing we don't want to print. NeKSter\nare we subject to censorship. But\nthese advantages wh i oh your four pence manages to hold secure, are not much\nuse if you do not supply us with something to proclaim our independence\nand TOURS.\nImportant news comes rarely; and\nwe fill a good deal of our space with\nfeatures, some useful, some faintly humorous. Here we rely on you. If the material is there, we will present\nit. If the enthusiasm is there, we\nwill reflect and amplify it. If apathy,is there, we can only weep.\nBat PNE S V/C Letter From V \u00ab u RICCI WRONG Dear Sir,I am usually prevented from writing to your newspaper by the one fact that SC\nmu oh has aroused my ire that I wouldn't know where to start. Today however I was roused by one\nthing above all else and so will concentrate on this. I refer to the letter by your Critic\" Ricci.\" Having nothing\nwhatsoever to do with the dramatic society\nas did your previous correspondent, Mr.\nShipley, preface my criticism with an\napology.\nRicci appears from his letter, both\nthrough its form and the views expressed\ntherein, to be an Intellectual, Long\nHaired, n it. I am aware that my description is repetitive. A man who cannot sort\nhis ideas out better than Ricci does should\nnot be allowed to criticise, for the essence\nof. criticism is surely a balance of pros\nand cons. If the pros are greater than\nthe cons then the criticism is favourable\nand vice versa. How does Ricci attempt\nto separate \" tell i ig a story'1\nfrom\n\"investigating a situation.\" Without a situation there can be no story and in telling the story the situation must\nbe clarified, which presumably involves\nthe investigation of factors influencing\nthe situation. Sometimes the investigation\nis deeper than o th. rs but to separate and\ndivide as Ricci does brings us back to\nthe old argument of which came first, the\nChicken or the Egg. (Can any expert on\nevolution help?)\nBasically I believe that plays,\nstories and poems were written originally for entertainment on the one side and\nprofit on the other. The expression of\na writer's feelings whilst doing this is usually subconscious if the play is to\nbecome art at all, and it will only become great art if these feelings touch\non the fundamental experiences of life. Let us be entertained for then we will listen and let us criticise accordingly.\nIt is an old platitude that Secrets will out, but I am happy to say that so will art without your pet (mon)goose Rio oi delving in and looking for it. l ours faithfully, John R. Looms.\nFOX HUNTER? Dear Sir,I should like to take this opportunity of bringing to your notice the fox-like behaviour of a certain person who,\nit would appear, is against fox hunting. The I.C. Riding Club decided to give a talk on fox hunting this term and was very\nkindly given a lecturer from the British Field Sports Society panel. A poster\nwas put up of the Internal Union Board,\nadvertising this meeting but within a few days it had been torn down.\nThis letter was held back in the\nhope that the persons who were against\nfox hunting would ao pear at the meeting\nbut their tactics seemed to exclude\nhonourable methods of approach.\nYours faithfully, Tony Gillham,\nPres. Riding Club.\nRE RIMSHOT Dear Sir or Man,\nLike this Rimshot is a juvenile in size 10 boats. In his(?) first article he gave a lucid, in te resting ao count of the history of jazz\nin1959 from temporary visits to permanent exits. Then in his last( I hope)\narticle a sad contrast; that John\nStaccato is the greatest is not for me\nto judge but one can hope that he will not last.

Those\nof us who in our Third Year attempt to\nbecome the theoreticians of the future\nhave the extremely irksome arrangement\nof taking our lectures commonly with\nthe mathematics second or third year.\nExcellent- though these lecturers are,\ntheir interpretation of the materials\nis liable to be defined more from the\npoint of view of the rigorous mathematician than from the standpoint of the\nphysicist, who is more interested in the\nuse of mathematical tools than in the\nanalytical discussion of these tools.\nFor my part, I find that living this\n\"double life\" between the maths, and\nphysics buildings has created innumerable Freudian complexes which can\nonly be resolved by the ultimate fate\nof us all madness!\nYours in Bedlam,\nFred ilo bert s.

    "content": "HE NEWSPAPER GvF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 144 Friday February !2tK19604 dRUG GER CLUB GIVE I. C.HANCE OF TRIPLE CROWN Not a great game, nor even a memorable one other than for the fao t that it put I.C.on oe again into the final of the\nU.L. U. Cup.\nProm start to finish the game was\nscrappy, being broken up by spasm odio three quarter movements, which inevitably\nfailed to reach the winger.\nIn the loose the College forwards\nwere undoubtedly superior to their opposite numbers and had the potential to\ndominate the play. In the line outs\nand the tight I.C. were again superior,\nparticularly striking being the jumping of\nJohn Bridges and the hooking of Dai Howe ll. In the second half I.C. lost only\ntwo of the set sorum s which gave an ind-*\ni cation of their superiority in the tight.\n\u2022 At half back I.C. did not get going\nuntil the. second half and even then.both\nhalf backs were slow in their movements,\nTheir slow ser vio e of the ball gave the\ncentres, who were very closely marked bj\nthe C.E.M. backs, little room in which\nto move and neither winger had a clear\nrun after the ball had travelled the\nthree quarter line.\nThe bao k row on oe again showed their\nvalue to the side and all three played\na great game. Otto Gilbert now seems\nto have regained his previous form and\na break of his from the line out in the\nsecond half left both his own team and\nthe opposition standing.\nC.E. M.k ioke d off and almost immediately I.C. were penal is ed for one of\ntheir centres being offside. For some\nunknown reason the referee had the kio k taken from the point of play rather than\nwhere the infringement had taken place.\nHanoook's kick was wide. Randal Peart\nout I.C. ahead, b.a penalty from the\nC.E.M. twenty five, a few minutes later.\nThis so ore gave I.C.a lead of 6-0 at\nhalf time.\nIn the seo iud half I.C, played a little better, and we saw some good linking up by the forwards.; Dai Howell,\nJohn Bridges, and Kris Tronski were ever\nprominent, the last two, sometimes seen\ncharging from the line out with several\nC.E.M. players clinging to them.\nFrom the first real three quarter\nmovement of the game Randal Peart came\ninto the line and scored a very fine try.\nHis own kick at goal failed. Some intelligent kicking by the centres gave J. Egan\nseveral good runs, but unfortunately he\nalways had too many men covering him, to\nmake the tine.\nThe final score came when Pat Bruce\ncame up very qui ok ly on to a loose ball\nover the C.E.M. line and touched down.\nMike Bregaiszi, who had led his team with\nfire and vigour added the points with akio k which brought back memories of the\nlast Cup game against Kings.\nIn the closing minutes. C.E.M. pressed hard and we saw some good running\nby their backs, but the I.C. line remained intact, and the final score was 11-0.\nThe final is on Saturday Feb. 20th. and we would like as many people as possible to help beat Vets at Motspur Park on\nthat day.\nMake a note oj Feb. 20th; T.G. King.\nCONGRATULATIONS Felix would like to offer its congratulations to Miss Hilary Tompsett\n*nd Mr Guy Hawkins on their engagement.\nPRESIDENTIAL VE W POINT The attitude of the IC Executive to\nthe Evening Standard's venture was\nrecorded in the last issue of Felix.\nThe deo is ion not to give information to\nthe paper has been adhered to, but behind\nany deo is ion that was taken was the idea,\nthat as soon as they published UL news\nin all editions we would give the\nStandard information. For under these\ncircumstances it is a venture worth\nsupporting. It was hoped that o ono er ted action by the College Unions and by ULU\nwould change the Standard supplement to\na suitable form. That is why at ULU\nPresidents' Council I tabled a motion\nurging the Colleges to give no help to\nthe Standard until it was clear that\ntheir UL supplement was serving the\nUniversity a useful purpose.\nIC Council on Monday evening supported the actions taken by the Executive.\nActing on the Bxeoutive decision I refused Mr John Clarke permission to write his\nfront-page story on IC last week, telling\nhim that only when the news was given in\nall editions would we support the venture.\nMr Clarke invited me to lunch to hear the\nreasons in full, an opportunity w hio hI took on Monday 8th February.\nm At the reopening yesterday of tha\nadjourned Presidents' Council I withdrew\nmy motion in favour of a ULU Executive\none that \"ULU recommends to the Evening\nStandard that it discontinues its UL\nslip edition\". I spoke to this motion\nand urged other colleges to follow IC's lead by refusing information. The\n.notion was carried by 16 votes to 10.\nIt appears though, that the other big\noo lle ges intend to get what they can\nfrom the scheme, for they voted against\nthe motion.\nAlso at the Presidents' Council it was agreed in view of a letter of apology\nfrom Mr Spellman that the suspension be\nlifted from midnight on Sat 13th Febj\nwhich means Council has in the space of\nthe same meeting agreed to his suspension\nand then lifted it almost at once I An\naction which I'm afraid will look like ao limb down by the Executive, since they\nproposed that suspension be lifted. It\nwaa also agreed, by a narrow majority,\nthat ULU only have observer status at NUS\nin future and not delegate status. The\nwearisome Presidents' Council dragged on\nover two days for 10| hours, of wh i oh at\nleast Vi hours concerned merely the\nproblem of Spellman, after the S. Africa\na cy c ott and the Standard embargo. I am\nthinking of initiating a Presidents'\nCouncil boycotts\nLes Allen - 10th Feb 1960.\nSTOP PRESS I.C.A. FC.

    "content": "AROUND THE TOWN\\ The history of the British \"musical\"\nhas so far. been one of a series of uninspired \"tonio\" productions o on si sting of\na thick s lio e of one aspect of British life o over ed with a layer of clotted sen-ti mentality. Except for Osborne's \"World of a Paul Sliokey\" w hio hoo ul d not\nin any way be o all eda success, this has\nalways been the case. The current production at the Royal Court \"The Lily White Boys\" may, I hope, be the first of\nmany to break away from this tradition. Tart, Cosh kid and Wide boy decide\nthat crime does not pay, that it is the\nrespectable that are comfortable and they\nset about seeing how they might join this, to them, elite group. Psychologically\nimprobable, maybe, but this is of no\nimportance to Harry Cookson, the playwright\nwho develops the situation with a biting satire w hio his continually present (perhaps\ntoo much so). The lyrics, which are only\nused when necessary, are by Christopher\nLogue and are set to music by Tony Kinsey\nand Bill Le Sage. The whole thing is brilliantly pro duo ed by Linsay Anderson.\nAlso recently opened, in the West End\nis another very fine play - John Mortimer's \"The Wrong Side of the Park\". It is extremely difficult to say something\nbriefly about this production, the basic\ncomplexity of w hio his added to by the\npresence of several implausibilities. The situation is to begin with this:\nthe Lee family, including parents and\nsister-in-law live in a large house\nfull of Viotorian gloom and ty pio ally over ornate. Into the house comes a lodger, who evokes in Mis. Elaine Lee\nmemories of he first husband. Elaine,\nplayed with beautiful o on tro l by\nMargaret Leighton, is a neurotic, nervously overwrought and drawn between\nthe a out al reality of her present husband and the ideal is ation of her former\nhusband in the lodger, both of whom she\nis inevitably comparing. Richard\nJohnson tao kle s very successfully the\ndifficult part of Elaine's husband with\nfine supp nfc t from Robert Stephens and\nWendy Craig. Peter Hall directs. Riooi.\nENGINEERS BALL The evening of Friday, January 30th saw a remarkable display of dinner jack-ets, white shirts and pretty girls. The occasion was, of course, the Engineers'\nBall, claimed by C.&G. to be the last word in I.C. social functions. Certain\nit is that the dinner was excellent, but\nnot more so than the speeches. Jolyon\nNove, C.<j bG. President, opened the\nafter dinner activities when he paid\ntribute to Mr. Manton's long service to\nGuilds Union as Honorary Treasurer. He\npresented Mr. Manton with an inscribed\ntankard and salver. Mr. Manton replied\nby saying that he had enjoyed doing the\njob and that it involved very little work. It is very difficult to believe\nthis last remark for Mr. Manton has put\nin an immense amount of work and the\nUnion really is very grateful to him.\nThe Dean, Professor Saunders, then\nproposed the health of tb\u00bb Union and\nJolyon Nove replied. Tim Wadsworth\nproposed the health of the guests in a very witty manner with references to\nthe past of the guest of honour, Monty\nHolbein, these caused a great deal of\nlaughter, especially from Mr. Holbein.\nThe other guests, including the Chief\nPercolator of the Instant Coffee Warming\nAmalgamation, the Presidents of t.C. and\nMines, and stepping in for a slightly jaundiced John Forster, the Secretary of\nR.C.S., were also wittily welcomed.\nMonty Holbein then rose,and gave oodles\nof advice to all the young ladies present on how to marry an engineer and all that. This was really uproarious and\nwas well received by all. The ball was very good, the bar and\ncoffee pit well patronised, and a good\ntime so to speak was had by all. I think congratulations are due to the\nGuilds Entertainments' Committee, and\nespecially to Tim Wadsworth, who\norganised the whole affair very\ncompetently.\nCOMING EVENTS\nFebruary 12th Huxley Society\n\"World Government\" (see notices)\nFebruary 16 th\nFilm Show \"Le Mans, 1955\"\nRoom 266, Aero. 5.45 p.m. FASHION SHOW I.C. will be represented by five members of I.C.

At this time of year the\nusual spate of jazz competitions appears\non the scene, and this year I.C. will probably be better represented than ever.\nJazz competitions generally tend to be\nrather poor affairs for the musicians\ntaking part. They are usually organised\nby people who' know very little about\nmus i a and musicians and are often judged\nby people who know even less l The usual\nstate of affairs is with about ten bands\nand one stand - that means ten drum kits, ten basses and about fifty musicians,\nand one stand. About five minutes playing time is allowed for each band (how\ncan a band possibly show its capabilities in two Bhort numbers?),and probably\ntwice as raich is allowed for changing\nbands over. The time spent by the judges\nin the bar constitutes a large proportion\nof the evening. Needless to say conditions are somewhat sham boli c one might\neven say chaotic.\nThen why do we enter - you might say\nObviously the thought of winning completely overshadows any thoughts concerning\nthe administration. Then there is pre s tige; all the other big oo lle gea are going to enter. We have bands wh i oh can\noutplay all of them put together.\nSo .we enter.\nKen Gibson's traditional band has\nreceived well deserved praise from all sides. Formed only a few weeks ago,\nthey have now built up a large repertoire and are playing a beautifully relaxed style of traditional jazz.This\ngroup has been entered for the WUS\nCompetition organised by N.E.C. and\nthey received favourable comment from\nthe judges of the preliminary round.\nThey are also entered for the InterU n ivers i ties Jazz Competition at\nReading on Feb. 17th. May I wish them\nthe very best of luck - they deserve it. The Jazz Gardeners comprising\nMessrs. Rushton, Farnsworth and Pr it chard o on tin ue to reo e ive high praise\nfrom all quarters. Their playing at\nhops is always attended by an app reo i at ive audience and congratulatory\nremarks just flood in. Their progress\nseems continuous - a wonderful recording session in the Pye - Nixa studios\nand the prospects of a commercial record\nare among their latest achi ev ment s. Many\nhigh hopes are pinned on the Jazz Gardeners for the Inter - Universities Competi tion at Reading. Incidentally, a coa o his being run to Reading on Wednesday 17th. Feb., and a quick application to Mr.\nRushton may secure you a place.\nRimshot.\n\n"

    "content": "7\nEXPLORATION IN THE TROPICS by Dr. Hugh B. Cott aa part of the I.C. Exploration Week.\nIt is refreshingly rare to find an\ns xplorer, who does not talk about his Last, or last but one expedition, but\n3an put over to an audience some of the\nloo u mula ted experience which he has gained\nhiring a lifetime of exploration. Br.\nhigh B. Cott, the dire ot or of the Univi rsi ty Museum of Zoology, Cambridge has\nthis ability, and as a result the lecturer hi ch he gave as part of the general\nstudies programme on Tuesday was one of\nthe best lectures on exploration we have\nyet heard at I.C. Dr. Cott started by saying he was\nlot an explorer, but merely a traveller and a naturalist. As his lecture pro-oe ed edit be o a me obvious that this was\nnot quite the truth. Many of the close\nup shots of wild animals which he\nshowed revealed not only a standard of\nphotography of the highest tech nio al excellence but also a very obvious\ndisregard of personal danger. His\ncomment that. .. \"when photographing\nwild animals, in order to get a good\nphotograph, one shouldn't just point\nthe camera at it, but get close enough\nso that it fills the reflex screen\"...\nsurely puts him into the class of an\nexplorer, in this particular field at least. In the first part of his lecture,\nDr. Cott compared tropical with other\ntypes of exploration. He pointed out\nthat the amount of equipment needed\nin the tr opi as is small by comparison\nwith, say, a polar or a high mountain\nexpedition, and that a tro pio al expedition can very easily live off the\nland. Further that polar exploration\nis more likely to be concerned with\ngeophysical or geographical exp lor at ion, and that in the, tropics attention\nIs naturally foo us sed more on the immense variety of both animal and plant\nlife wh i oh exists there.\nDr. Cott moved next to photo-graph y,a subject evidently close to his. heart, and pointed out that bas-ic ally there were two techniques.\nOne could either be prepared and try\nto get photographs as the opportunity\narose, or one oo ul d wait for the sub-j ect and plan any given photograph.\nFinally, to end his talk, Dr. Cott\nsaid that even an explorer oo ul d not\nbe on the move and working all the time,\nand that a hobby was essential. He\nthen showed a series of slides of pen\nand ink sketches done during his\nspare moments in A fria a. At this juncture Dr, Cott showed himself\nto be not only a first rate photographer,\nbut an artist of quite exo ep tian alt al ent. Indeed, these final sketches left\nthe audie no e with su oha vivid impression\nof their eu bj eot, that photograph, even\nof Br. Cott's high standard, oo ul d no\nwhere near equal them.\nSTANDARD SAFARI CROSSCOUNTRY The second team was unlucky to lose\nby only half a point to University College\nin a league fixture held at Mitcham on Wed.\n27th. In the same mato h KiJig's College\nand L.S. B. were easily defeated. The I.C runners were well spread out after the\nsix mile run: Huntley (3), Hammonds (5)\nand Butler(8) were the first three home.\nOn the same day another second team\nheavily defeated Brentwood School by 29\npts. to49 at Petersham. Bernard was\nfirst with Berber (2) and Yi'ar ren(3) fol lowing some way behind.\nA first team travelled to Aylesbury\non the following Saturday to run against\nthe Vale of Aylesbury Athletic Club. The\nmatch was very close and resulted, in a narrow victory for I.C. by 27 pts. to\n28. The course was heavy and times were\ncorrespondingly slow. Collins(2) finished\nfirst for I.C. with Bernard (3) not far behind. At the same time a second team\neasily defeated Bancroft's School in Essex.\nWith 6 runners in the first seven positions\nthe final score was I.C.2 nd,13 pts.\nBenoroft's School 29 pts. Notable performances were those of George Turner, vr tio won,\nand Hoger Hedge, our new up and coming star\nwho was fifth. The University College Annual Invitation Race was held at Parliament Hill Fields on Saturday 6th Feb, A strong\nOxford Tortoises team won with 88 pts.\nfollowed by I.C. first team with 90 pts.\nand Southampton University121 pts. The\nsecond team were 8th being the fourth London College team to finish. John Collins was 2nd while Larkum (10), Bernard (12)\nBarber (16) and Warren (21) put up very\ngood performances. Roger Hedge was the\nthird2 nd team runner to cross the line.

The\nusual method is to run the distance in ten\nmile stages but other variations have been\nused.\nAt present Birmingham University hold the record, with a time of under 93\nhours; other Universities to have com-,\nple ted are Oxford (the originators), Cambridge and Exeter while an attempt by\nBristol was defeated by last summer's hot weather.\nIt had been hoped that an I.C. team should make an attempt but instead\nthe team will now be drawn from the whole\nUniversity. Even so it is likely that the\nmajor support will be from this College.\nThe two reserves are taken so that\nif one of the team breaks down the whole\nattempt can continue using a replacement.\nThese two also act as ooo ks, drivers, etc.\nbut even so several others will be needed\nto complete the Escort Party, and anyone\ninterested in taking part is asked to contact J. H. Collins through the Union\nRack - It should be pointed out that the\nactual running is one of the lesser problems compared with arranging Escort\nvehicles and meals and sleeping of the\nRunners.\nBEAU TIC WAR I ANN*7 CAROLYN RUSSELL SQUASH The 1st team have continued in their winning vein over the last fortnight,\nbeat i rir Keble College. Oxford (3-2), \".Vest-minster Hospital ( 4 - l), Leicester Univers it y(41), St. Catharine's College, Cambridge (3-2), but unfortunately they went\ndown to London Hospital, with a much\nweakened team (3-2): we hope to reverse\nthis decisively on the 16th l? eb. when they\noom e to play at I.C. The vio tory against\nLeicester was very pleasing, since they\nwere one of the three sides to beat us\nlast term.\nUnfortunately everyone was eliminated from the U.L. Cup in the 1 st and\n2nd rounds. Brian Avient went out to Mike Kingston, the University Captain,\nfinding it difficult to^get used to the\nfast casts at St. Mary's. Peter Odell\nlost to Tim Goodwin, U.L. Secretary.\nHans Espig to Gazadar, ex-U.L. Captain\nand Pakistani international; they could\nhardly have picked better opponents S Brian Haywood lost to Tony Ch ign ellin a very good match, but he found to his oost\nthat the effects of too much Christmas\n\"pu d\" were still with him. No news has\nbeen heard from U.C. concerning the inter college 3-a side competition, so it looks\nas though we may have a w.o. into the\n3rd round.\nThe 2nd Team's record is not quite\nSO good and they have had to put up with\na. number of cancellations, but we hope they\nwill manage to make a better finish to\nthe season.\nNext week the 1 st Team has a busy\ntime with four matches on hand. The\nEscorts (H) on Monday, King's College (H) on Tuesday, Ashstead (A) on Thursday, and\nYiueen' s 'College, Cambridge (H) on Saturday.\nEscorts and Ashstead were two of the three\nclubs which beat u3 last year, out of\nabout 30 played, and Quern's beat us (0-5)'\nlast term; we shall have a hard task on\nhand if we are to beat all three.\nThe run is planned for the week\nafter Easter ( April19 th26 th) when it i3 hoped that weather conditions will hot\nbe too unfavourable\nJohn H.
