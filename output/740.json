    "content": "There have all done well this year even the sports hop. BOOKSHOP\nAfter a \u00a31000 loss in 1983-84, a \u00a327000 profit was made last year with \u00a35000 being\npaid to the four Unions. This year a better return is being expected. Accounts and\nstock control are in the process of being computerised.\nSPORTSHOP\nAfter two bad loss making years the Sportshop may well show a small surplus this\nyear. The losses were in many ways due to large amounts of old opening stock from\nwhen the running of the shop was transferred to Union control from the Southside\nShop nearly three years ago. Roy Hicks and Jason Gold are larg ley responsible for\nthese improvements and should be thanked for their efforts.\nSNACK BAR\nThis has progressed well this year, with much improved takings, but unfortunately\nthis has meant longer que ques. Ways of alleviating this must be considered as part\nof a general refurbishment of the room. Norman and Julie have worked hard and\nremained cheerful, despite a high turnover of regular assistants. Yet again they\ndeserve the highest praise. The part of Senior treasurer has been filled this year by\nthe appoint e ment of Dr Bob Schroter, a former chairman of the College Refectory\nCommittee. His imput has been significant already.\nUNION BAR\nWithout a doubt this has been the more time consuming aspect of my job as well as\nbeing the most enjoyable. When we took over the Bar, often a lot of background\nwork, it was partly due to the commitment of Martin Parsons and the College\nappointing Moore Lyttle as manger whilst they were in charge that the changeover\nwas smooth and larg ley problem free. We have been extremely lucky in finding two\nsuch dill i gent Barmen as Moore and Kevin Buckley. Complaints about the toning\ndown of excesses have been outweighed by the drifting back of more non-hacks.\nMoore's approach has been vital in this aspect,\nUNION BUILDING\nIn a rapid period of change and expansion such as we have experienced this year,\nitis inevitable that some parts of an already full job description will have to take a back seat. Sadly this year, the Union Building has not received the attention that it\ndeserves. Hopefully, Jackie can do better at this next year..\nNIGHTLINE\nNightline has been threatened with extinction this year, despite the work of Anne\nCox. This has been largely due to a loss of revenue was precipitated by the KQC\nmerger, Pete Wilson has been liaising between Anne and College and ULU.\nHowever he has recently not been able to spare the time to keep this up, and I have\ntaken over. At present I am still trying to secure financing for next year. There is a possibility that Nightline may move to ULU.\nWOMEN'S OFFICER\nI was delighted to see this post created, and indeed play a small part in if s creation.\nWhilst this post may smack of tokenism, this is an important add it on to the list of\nofficers, especially in a college with so few women students. For it to succeed, a good first holder of the post was needed. None better than Christine Taig could have\nbeen found. I raised the same issue for the first time this year at GU C in my ULU\npresidential campaign. ULU is now set to follow ICU and this is something that we\nshould be proud of.\nCOLLEGE COMMITTEES\nBy and large decisions are made at College level before these committees meet.\nMore of these decisions are outlined in other areas of my report or Carl's. GOVERNING BODY, AND FINANCE AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\nGoverning Body is the ultimate decision making body in College. It is an extremely\npolite and very stuffy meeting Quentin and I seriously considered doing the\nunthinkable of voicing complete opposition to a paper that had been presented as if\nit had ICU agreement. This was the new College disciplinary proc ce dure s, but on\narrival at the meeting a extra paper was tabled which agreed to our proposed final\namendments. F&E is effectively an interim Governing Body. All three of us have\nspoken up when necessary at both bodies, e quitting ourselves pretty well in my\nview.\nSAFETY COUNCIL\nVery early onin my first meeting of this, Ibegan to wonder what on earth I was there. I am a Maths Graduate who has hardly set forth in a lab since leaving school. The\nquestion of the Deputy President being ex/officio safety officer must seriously be\nrecommended when s/ he comes from a non-lab orientated discipline.\nAccident reports have been dominated as usual by Chemists who either stab\nthemselves when their pipettes breaks whilst a filler is being attached or obtain a mouthful of acid otherwise. Accident reports from Chemists are so common because\nof their dill i gence in reporting them and the nature of their subject or is it because\nChemists are chumps?\nHOUSE COMMITTEE\nThis is now claimed by a Governor, Peter Foster, and no longer by the Rector. It has\nbeen an effective forum for free discussion. I have quite enjoyed it. This has been\nthe only effective yet not stuffy, high powered College committee.\nCATERING AND CONFERENCE SERVICES MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\nThis is almost totally useless. All too often it is just a forum for Rob Northey and Gill\nDavies to bitch at each other in public. John Smith uses it as a way of formally\napproving his decisions.\nBAR COMMITTEE\nI chair this. Basically, with the advent of the CCSMC it has no power, I am trying to\nfind a new dire c it on for it.\nREFECTORY USER COMMITTEE\nHas as much power as the Bar Committee. Simon Perry prom tes his views as those\nof the committee even when it is united against him. Northey just waffles on for ages\nabout nothing.\nOUTSIDE BODIES\nICU has a habit or trying to be belligerently independent and ignorant of many of\nthese. I have tried to get to know about a few of the most relevant.\nULU\nll m peri al College has had a bad reputation within ULU reaching the pits last year\ndue ot Michael Newman and a Hit Squad. This has changed this year Carl, Quentin\nand I get on well with a larger member of officers from other colleges and the ULU\nExec. I have been actively involved at ULU and enjoyed it. As a result I belive that I have helped make ICU one of its most influential constituent unions. Sabbaticals\nfrom all over the University phone me up to ask for advice or help. This has to reflect\nwell on ICU. The most obvious example of this was a request by a number of ULU\nhacks that I stand for President. After a lot of thought I did stand. One of the reasons\nthat I lost was a lack of campaigning as I was not prepared to abandon my job, or\nstudies, for two weeks like most other candidates.\nNUS\nIt never ceases to amaze me how many people around this college pontificate forth\non this subject without knowing what the hell they are on about. Very few people will\ndeny the need for a national representative body for students. For some people this\njustifies open ended subservience. For others the left-wing domination of this\norganisation condemns it as a complete waste of time. When I arrived here nearly\nfive years ago I knew nothing about the arguments for or against NUS, yet\nwhenever NUS is discussed people who know bugger all about nothing bele ive they\nare experts. After a year in office I know a lot more about NUS than I realised ther\nwas to know, yet I remain to be convinced either way. If there is to be a referendum\nabout this next year I hope that it will be the culmination of a well informed debate.\nDon't be fooled by arguments like; These left-wing loonies want to rip you off\" or\n\"We must join because otherwise we are getting the benefits of the NUS without\npaying our money\".\nNSSO\nThe NUS set up the National Student Services Organisation as a way of taking over\nthe various student bulk purchasing organisations for their own political ends. NUS\nd is affiliates are not allowed to join, but may enjoy the benefits of NSSO on payment\nof three times the normal membership. Phil Woolas stated to Jackie and me that this\nis to prevent d is affiliation. Ibelieve that this is also intended to force re affiliation. To\nmaintain this position, NUS have injected \u00a350,000 into NSSO and created company\nwith virtually unchangeable rules. So far we have not lost out on any deals. It would\nalso appear at the moment that ULU is prepared to continue to support us if NSSO\nare able to bring pressure upon suppliers to remove or reduce discounts.\nColleagues\nJen, Pat and Kathy; they have coped admirably with our eccentricities and failings\nThere is no point in saying any more as I would only end up repeating the praise in\nprevious reports.\nCarl and Quentin; we are still friends after a year. I could not have done my job\nwithout the shear hard work of Quentin or the eccentric brilliance of Carl, I cannot\nthink of one plan or objective taken on by ICU this year which has been achieved -usually because of Carl.\nConclusions\nDespite all the hard work and frustration, I have to admit to a sense of ache ive ment and enjoyment. It's difficult to see why this is, especially when being Deputy\nPresident is such a thankless job. I wish Jackie all the best for next year.\nHon Secretary\nQuentin Fontana\nIt is not my in tet ni on that this report be confined to just what I have done but to give\nsome idea about my views of this union whilst speaking from experience derived\nfrom other Universities I have spent time at.\n1 Transport\n1 a Administration This year I have introduced a new booking system for weekend\nminibus hire with a form being used which is intended to provide more information\nthan was previously available on random slips of paper. They seem to have\nworked fairly well in allowing me to make more eff i cent use of our own busses,\nalong with outside hire ones. There have been some quite considerable problems\ntough with cancellations and I feel that the general attitude of clubs is very poor,\no articular ly when they try to get me to change the system to give their own club\npriority even when they don't really need a minibus.\n1b The Union Crewbus Fleet (Italian Minibusses Inc) I have tried to keep all the\nbusses in reasonable running order and in particular the oldest one (HLO yellow )\non which I have spent quite a bit of money to keep it going as it is cheaper to do so\nthan to keep selling and replacing with new vehicles. I don't believe that having a somewhat scrappy bus is any problem as the whole idea of the fleet is to provide a cheap and basic service without frills. I must however complain about the level of\nmisuse by students which is a major contribution factor to the short life on the\nbusses. The fleet will be shortly be increased to five busses which I believe will be\nwell worthwhile, being three thirteen seaters and two seventeen seaters, this is\nsomething I am doing with an election promise. I must express my thanks to\ntransport officer Jerry Hasnip for all the help this year in keeping the fleet in\nreasonable order.\n1 c Outside Hire Buses In general. I have managed with just Budget and\nTranslocation, with Swan National supplying some early on. There seem to be\nproblems for next year as Budget Earl's Court are stopping supplying minibusses,\nwhich may result in greatly increased costs so the whole concept may require\nlooking into. Some of the late cancellations have resulted in a great deal of bad\nfeeling with the hire companies.\n1 d Accidents There has been a general attitude that the Union should be\nresponsible for all accidents rather than the drivers\n2 Insurance\n2a Club Equipment At the start of the year there were three different files\ncontaining various inventories of equipment owned by clubs and societies, many\nof which were we el out of date and bore very little resemblance to to what was\nactually insured. I have now reduced them to one file of up-to-date inventories and\nadjusted our policies accordingly. I have had major problems all year with clubs not\nsupplying me with inventories or giving updates, so it is very possible that that\nthere is much valuable equipment which is uninsured. Some people are, however,\nvery good at updating inventories, particularly DramSoc and IC Radio. As h write there are quite a few outstanding claims, many of which I am waiting for\ndoc ume nation from clubs which most are very slow to provide.\n2b Halls of Residence At the start of the year some negotiation, by Carl and myself\nresulted in a reduction of the premium from \u00a315 to \u00a37.50 but this is unlikely to be\nrepeated next year due to an increase in claims and it is possible that the premium\nmay be increased sharply. At the time of writing I am looking at a new type of\npolicy.\n3 Duplicating Service\n3a Duplicating The Union dupl ict a ing service basically consists of a photocopier, a Gestetner and a typewriter, all of which are available for use by clubs and\nsocieties. The photocopier has given the most problems this year, particularly due\nto a complete failure of the auto-paper feed mechanism., only working when\nmanually fed. It took ages to get Canon to come and fix it but they did eventually\nand, at the time of writing, it is running well. It was during the period of inaction that\nthe office acquired the second photocopier for office use which I believe Jen and\nPat are finding very useful in that they can use at any time, without waiting for\nstudents to finish with it., this being a major problem with just having the one. The\nGestetner is working reasonably well when in cap p able hands but has been\ncausing a few problems for the less experienced. It is not easy to say why. I have\nunfortunately been very lax in cleaning it but I hope to be able to hand over a dean\n\n"

I 've\nnever read such a load of\nrubbish. Try and read the 9\npages of reports included\nin this week's FELIX. In\nthese reports almost every\nofficer attempts to bitch\nabout the people they don'tI like and praise their friends.\nThere are some which are\nextremely unpleasant\npersonal attacks on people\nwho've put a lot of time\ninto the Union. Perhaps\npeople should remember\ntheir own faults before they\nstart attacking other\n, people. This year has been\ni a poor one for the Union.\n, People should be trying to\nfind out what went wrong.\nThey shouldn't be\nattempting to put the blame\non others. I wish certain\nUnion Officers would grow\nup and stop acting like\nspoilt children\nFELIX has been attacked\nby Union President Carl\nBurgess. He accuses me of\nfilling FELIX with 'esoteric\nand incomprehensible\narticles' and ignoring the\nordinary student. He has\naccused me of factual\ninaccuracies. (Read the\nsection of the report on\nFELIX, it's on page 2 of the\nreports under Pub Board).\nIf the report is passed by\nthe AGM I will have to\nconsider my position and\nmay well resign.\nYou've read FELIX this\nyear. I think its reported\nICU AGM\nThursday 1pm facts and reflected your\ninterests fully. You've read\nFELIX so you know if I'm right or wrong. If you want\nto defend FELIX's right to\ncriticise the Union come to\nthe U GM and oppose Carl's report before the end of\nterm. If you agree with Carl\nand think FELIX has been a waste of money this year\ncome and support the\nreport so that I resign and\nsave the Union some\nmoney.\nHall Rents\nThe College has decided to\nraise rents in halls and\nhouses by an average of\n5.35%. The undergraduate\ngrant next year will be 2%\nhigher than the grant this\nyear. This means that\nstudents living in hall will\nyet again have less to\nspend in real terms on\nfood, books etc then they\nhad the year before. The\nGovernment is making life\ndifficult for students . There\nis no need for the college\nto help them. When the\nConservative government\ncame to power, it was still\ntrue that most people could\nafford to come to College.\nNow you generally need\nparental support. The class\nof 86 are being supported\nby their middle class\nparents. Imperial is trying\nto attract the best students\nby offering the best\ncourses. There's no point\nhaving the best courses in\nthe country if there's nowhere for your students\nto live. The most alarming\nthing is the fact that the\nUnion didn't oppose these\nprice increases.\nCredits\nNormally I use this section\nof FELIX to thank the\npeople who've helped on\nthe issue. As this may be\nmy last issue I'd like to\nthank all the people who've\nhelped on FELIX this year. I think that together we've\nproduced some good\nFELIXs and I'd like to thank\nyou all for your efforts.\nYou've all worked far too\nhard and I disagree with\neverything Carl and others\nhave said about you. I don't really know how to express\nmy appreciation sufficiently\nbut I hope thanks will do.\nThanks.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College\nUnion Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union\nPrint Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW72 BB,( Tel 01-589 5111\next 3515).

    "content": "Gestetner at the end of June. As far as the typewriters go we have had a somewhat unsuccessful year as they have proved to be reliable despite replacing\nthem. At the time of writing the club's one is working although my recent fixing of it\nlends me to have grave doubts about ifs reliability. A major change I have made to\nthe duplicating service has been to move the photocopier from my office into the\nmain office. I didi this for two main reasons, first to get it out of my office so that I would be able to work easier without interruptions which are very damaging to a train of thought and hence make working much more difficult, and also to put it in a postion where it can be supervised better. I feel that h te move has been\nworthwhile.\n3b Disposal of junk I have cleaned out a large amount of junk from my office and\nthe Queen Mum's Poweder room (my store room) so that there is now much more\nroom to accumulate new junk and useful artifacts. I have also taken quite a few old\nmini te books down to the college archives, apparently the first time for may years\nthat this has been done.\n3c Stationary Maintaining the Union stacks of stationary basically consists of\n5a king a Sainsbury's trolly down to central stores a couple of times a week. This is\na job which takes up a remarkable amount of time, particularly due to opening\nhours. I have endeavored to keep a reasonable amount of usable items for various\nitems, but this has not always been possible.\n4 Union Committees\nThere are many of these that I sit on and a significant number for which I take\nminutes. Minute taking and writing up takes a remarkably large amount of time and\nI find it very difficult to see the justification in having a paid sabbatical to do this\nwhen it could be easier for each committee to appoint if s own secretary viz MScs\nand the Academic Affairs Committee, this releasing the Hon Sec to do more\nimportant jobs as the Union ex pans ifs sphere of influence and trading, and\nchanges ifs set up and organisation over the years. I will admit that this may be a problem for only this year being due to Council's desire for expanded minutes,\n\u2022something that has caused Pat and myself a lot of work. I have attempted to keep\nthe minutes accurate and I feel that I have achieved this, the lack of apparent\ncorrections being fairly indicative, but I have included the odd joke or personal\ncomment to try and make them more interesting.\n4a UGMs and Exec News This year UGMs appear to have resulted in reasoned\nargument for the most part on several issues of direct relevance to IC students.\nOne thing that I have found somewhat worrying is the way in which, when I put\nfairly flippant comments in my report along with serious reports, the only parts\nwhich get questions are the flippant ones. It has as ever been as disappointing to\nfind that UGMs are in quo rate. The challenging of quorum has lead to a great deal\nof debate about quorum as ac ncep t in that many people dont appreciate the\nreason for its existence. Quorum exists to protect the Union from having\ncon ten cio us policies passed by an unrepresentative number of people, any\nreduction in the level of quorum would lessen the power of any UGM decision as\nwell as making UGMs much more vulnerable to the 'block vote' type of tactic from\nany pressure group. For the past four years Exec News has been printed in the\nFELIX PPrint Unit to provide a better quality publication. I found problems with it\nthis year due to the rapidly moving events in the first term and also the problems\nwith Tony, the printer, being off sick at so I reverted to the previous system of\nGestetner printing which resulted in greater flexibility but poorer quality. The\ncahn ge was for reason of circumstance rather than being a move to change the\nsystem permanently so I don't know what Dave will do next year nor shall I advise\nhim which way to go.\n,4b Council: Council this year has been very fraction a ted with a very obvious divide\nbetween the FELIX clique and the rest wi ch has lead to a very unhealthy\natmosphere and a great.deal of bickering. I have had the general impression this\nyear that Council has been working against the Union rather than for it with a general opinion that it has tended to concentrate on a couple major items of\nbusiness to the almost complete exclusion of other, lesser but still important items.\nIt was for this reason that, on my re com end ation, the Executive decided to split the\nJanuary meeting into two halves so that the issue of the proposed FELIX move\nwould not cloud the other items on the agenda. I feel that this was a success but I very upset when, at the second meeting, a line was deleted from the minutes of\nthe first which succinctly summed up the situation at that moment. Another of the\nmajor problems with Council this year has been the officers not submitting reports\nin time for them to be typed, duplicated a nd circulated so that other members of\nCouncil have been unable to read them properly and consider the implications of\nthe items mentioned. It was this point that led to the cancellation of the March\nmeeting due to there being an a parent lack of business. Subsequent information\nhas indicated that I was correct to do so.\n4c GUC: Over the year I have come to the conclusion that ULU GUC is a complete\nand utter waste of time except to visit ULU bar and meet students from other\ncolleges. It tends to concern itself with far too much petty party political wrangling s with very little actual interest in the direct affairs of students. One thing that I have\nfound very disturbing is the total lack of respect that the majority of delegates have\nfor the views an ad opinions of others when they differ even slightly from their own\nextreme left wing politics. There have been times when I have been very amused\nby the complete lack of s uss that some delegates have and the way they make\nclaims without any information to back them up. LSE have been the worst\noffenders in this respect but they are not alone.\n4d MSCs: Whilst the three s a bbb at ical officers are full members of the MSCs, their\nrole is little more than to observe and make sure that they don't act\nun constitutionally. Unfortuantely I haven't been able to attend as many of these\nmeetings as I would have liked, mainly due to the timings of the meetings, but I have been reasonably impressed by the professional manner in which they have\nbeen run, credit for this must go to the chairmen.\n4e Internal Services: This I feel has probably been the best and most effective of\nthe minor sub committees this year and was largely responsible for much of the\nearly work with respect to the Union Bar. Meetings have tended to be long and\nfairly verbal but unlike some other committees this verbosity hasn't been confined\nto one or two individuals and most of the discussion has been useful and objective.\nMuch of the credit must go to chairman Alan Rose for making this a very useful\ncommittee.\n. 4f External Affairs: This is a total contrast to Internal Services in that it has done\nvery little as a committee apart from discuss what is on the GUC agenda. This\nincludes motions which are frequently about issues on which we have no policy as\na Union so voting has to be done at the disc re sion of the delegate. The EAO has\nhowever tried to force a party line which almost defeats the object of having\nelected delegates to GUC. I have rarely bothered to take minutes for this\ncommittee due to there being nothing but GU C discussed and as such make no\napology for not doing so. The worst thing about this committee is that the\nChairman has been dealing with items and campaigns behind the back of the\ncommittee with almost no reference to it. .\ndictatorship ,in many ways it has but I make no apology for it as I feel that it is\ninevitable when only a couple of people actually know what is going on.\n4h Union Finance Commmittee:This showed the usual CCU/MSC divide but I got\nthe impression that there wasn't the same antagonism as there has been in\nprevious years with a general air of realism. I am writing this before the May UFC so\nmy opinion may change greatly then. The permitted expenditure policy statements\nwere a useful exercise.\n5 College Committees: I only sit on a couple of these which is something that I am\nextremely grateful for as they are generally very tedious and don't seem to do much\nof any consequence.\n5a Refectory Users:This is a committee which combines the ranting s of Chairamn\nSimon Perry with the smooth bullshit of Refectory Manager Rob Northey. It was\nnote able that the most constructive meeting that this committee had was the one\nwhen Northey was out of the country.\n5b Health Service Users: This is extremely boring and I really dont know why the\nHon Sec sits on it, it was probably due to a bit of delegation a few years ago. I dont\nthink that most of the members really know what the committee is trying to do and\nmuch of the discussion a pears to have been on items which seem irrelevant or\nshould be dealt with by other committees such as Safety Council.\n5c Parking and Traffic: This is a complete and utter waste of time as Security Chief\nGeoff Reeves tends to take over and run the meetings despite officially being the\nsecret ay. The most that I can say in its favour is that this committee doesnt meet\nvery often.\n5d Governing Body and F and E: These committees are a complete contrast to the\nother College Committees in that they tend to result in reasoned argument and\ndiscussion of many of the issues which are of major interest to the College rather\nthan being rubber stamp committees. Although it is not easy to make a major\ncontribution during the meetings, the post meeting lunches are a very useful way of\ngetting the students views known to some very influential people such as politicians.\n6 Parking Permits: I see em to have managed the allocation of these with e the minimum of fuss mainly due to not advertising the appeals procedure meaning that\nit was those who really deserved and actually wanted them who got them. Once the\nappeals allocation had been made I only had one person complain and they were\nfirst on the short list for reallocation of returned permits anyway, although when one\nbecame available he didn't bother to pick it up. The introduction of the \u00a35 deposit\nresulted in some being returned which is at least an improvement on previous years.\n7 Elections. The sabbatical elections went off fairly smoothly, although I had a great deal\nof difficulty in getting an elections commit ee together. In the event it didn't matter, but a couple of decisions which should have been committee decisions I had to take myself. A major problem occured with the election rules in that a major change was proposed last\nyear and went before the elections sub commit ee but as there is no record of them being\npassed, I had to work with the old rule, which are woefully inadequate. The problem only\ncame to light after the sabbatical papers had gone up, so there was nothing that i could do\nabout it. The dep rep elections didn't go off as smoothly, mainly due to incompetent\nreturning officers, illustrating that there are times when it may be a good idea to delegate\nresponsibilities. Other elections seem to have been performed with the minimum of fuss.\n8 Union Bar. The bar has been a prime target for a Union take over for years, and now we\nhave it. This has caused me a few problems in a social sense as I feel guilty about drinking\nin Southside when I could be increasing the Union bar takings. The main problem is that\nthe bars are a very good place for officers to meet non 'hack' students, and that limiting\noneself to the Union tends to reduce the contact one has with the general student body\nthus limiting the feedback one gets from them, hence making the job of representation\nmore difficult. It has been a problem I have found very difficult to overcome.\n8a Bar Boycott. I was very impressed with the response to the boycott call, and I feel that it\nreflected well on IC students that when something is worthwhile and attainable, yet\nrequires a personal sacrifice, they are p reared to make that sacrifice and fight for it What I was less impressed with was the resp once of the Union officers. The Union bylaws state\n'the officers of the Union shall be responsible for carrying out the policy of the Union as\ndetermined by a General Meeting.' yet when it came to the picket to enforce the boycott,\napart from the six members of the Executive committee I can only think of three council\nmembers who regularly attended being Alan Rose, Hugh Stiles and Tim Palmer. In my\nopinion this lack of commit t ment to the Union was deplorable. I write this six months after\nthe event so I apologise too anyone whom I have forgotten.\nCONCLUSION\nSo that in my view of my is the year broken up into sections but the question I must now ask\nis whether the whole is the sum of the parts. I don't think that it is exact ll y and I leave the job\nwith an impress io on of the whole year rather than a lot of impressions of various parts. So\nwhy did I do it? And would I do it again? Over the year I have frequently been asked why I took on the job and the usual reply that I have given has been 'I got drunk one nigh f. Before the start of the evening of the Guilds Centenary Barnight it hadn't occured too me\nto stand but for some reason, whilst under the in fl lu en ce of a couple of halves of shandy, I let Chris Mason per su ad me to stand just for the sake of having an election. I spent nothing\non my campaign, considerably less than Dave who was unopposed, yet I was elected\ndespite being beaten by AB Stain by 22 votes, i had always intended to resign immediately\nif elected but Roger Preece persuaded me to do it so I did. Despite this somewhat\nun encouraging start I have no regrets about doing the job apart form it taking up a year of\nmy life in an activity that will in all probability have little to do with my future career, at my\nage every year counts. As far as achievements go, the answer to that question must be\nthat as I org in ally only intended to force an election I achieved that admirably yet I still work\non the job so I suppose that any general achievement over the year must must be\nconsidered. I haven't reality done anything more than what is required in the Hon Sec job\ndescription yet a simple job description only identifies areas of responsibility and the\nincumbent man can expand or contract their activities within those areas almost at will. It is\nvery diff ii cult to assess how well one has performed as it is easily possible too convince\noneself that one is doing the work of two people whilst not actually fulfilling one's own\nresponsibilities so I will have to leave performances as an open ended question for others\nto decide on. The question of whether I would do it again is probably the most difficult to\nanswer as I am now writing with hindsight and feel that I have some idea as to what the job\nentails. Again I must leave this as an open ended answer as my reply would usually\ndepend on my state of mind at the time but I would like to state categorically that my move\nto a provincial university is in no way intended to qualify me for a second sabbatical year\nnor do I intend doing one. When it comes to fulfilment of election promises I can only think\nof two positive points that I raised both during the Hustings questions, the first was that I would like to see an increase in the size of the minibus fleet something which is currently in\nthe process of happening, the second was to improve the quality of paper darts at UGMs. I have made absolutely no effort in this direction apart form supplying more paper for\npractise, I humbly grovel and beg forgiveness.\nI apologise for the length of this report and also for areas which overlap with Carl and\nDave's reports but I have tried to give my overall impressions of my view as Hon Sec along\nwith my philosophy of work and professional interactions with col teague ss.I also apologise\nif large parts of this report seem like one long complaint, much of it was written in a somewhat pissed off mood, I cant really hate students that much as Is t it il want to spend\nanother three years amongst them pushing my university career to over a decade in\nlength.\nCREDITS\nThere are far too many people to thank by name but particularly thanks must go too Jen,\nPat, and Kathy for keeping me sane and putting up with me for a year and to all those\nwhom I have served on committees who have had to put up with my minutes and appa ling sense of humour.\n\n"

As may be\nexpected from misogynistic\ntales of femme fatale s, the\nwoman in question gets her\njust deserts, punished for\nher sexuality.\nThe film too is rather\npredictable full of\nunimaginative and clich e ridden direction. I can't really recommend it on any\nlevel, in spite of the\nmarvellous M Serrault, and\nTHEATRE\nFail/safe is a story of four\nwomen and their ties to\neach other. By looking at\ntheir lives, Fail/Safe\nexamines a variety of\nemotions, ranging from\nguilt and jealousy to\nlon lines s, emotional\nblackmail, communication\nand the problems of facing\nold age.\nThere are two separate\nfront rooms through which\nthe audience must pass to\ntake their 'Fly on the wall'\nseats. One is occupied by\nGwen, her sister Ella, and\ndaughter Jo on a Summer\nSaturday. The other, by\nMavis, who is periodically\nvisited by Jo during the\nmonth preceeding the\naction occur ing in Gwen's room.\nEssentially the plot in\nGwen's home revolves\naround the 42 year old Jo,\nwho has only recently\nmanaged to move out and\nreturns for the weekend.\nTorn by feelings of anger\nand guilt, Jo superficially\nblames her mother for the\ninadequacy she feels, but\nshe is fully aware that her\nfaults lie chiefly within\nherself.

Homage to\nCatalonia is one of Orwell's brilliant but lesser\nrecognised works,\ndescribing his part in the\nSpanish Civil War, which\nwas the equivalent of Korea\nwhere both US and USSR\ngave aid to the same side.\nThe fighting, the lice in the\ntrouser seams, dogs\nbranded with revolutionary\nslogans and Italian fascists\nmachine-gunning civilian\nrefugees at Malaga are all\ndescribed clearly and\nobjectively. The early\neuphoric war gave way to\nbickering between the\nCommunists and\nAnarchists, which\ndisillusioned Orwell and left\nhim and his comrades in\nthe International Brigade\nmarked as traitors. After\nbeing wounded in the neck,\nhe, his wife and a fellow\nsoldier escaped over the\nFrench border, fleeing from\nthe people that they had\nfought for.\nThe best parts of the\nbook are the concluding\ndiscussions of the nature of\npropaganda, government,\nfascism, false and real\natrocities, which are much\nmore worthwhile than the\nponti fi cations of noncombatant English\nintellectuals. Orwell's humanity, humour and\nvision are well expressed in\nthis book, published by\nPenguin for \u00a31.95.\npossibly because of the\nrather ham MS Rampling.\nFinally to complete the\ntheme of women and film,\nthe ICA is running a series\nof exploitation films\ndirected by women.

Jo's visits afford\nher a way of offsetting the\nguilt she feels regarding\nher mother.\nThe performance given\nby Helena McCarthy, a real\nold lady, as Mavis, is one of\nthe most impressive I have\never witnessed.

    "content": "do not actually own anything, certain areas of the building were granted to us tighten up the agreement, and so our provisional agreement became final\nfor our use by the Governing body and what the Governing Body gives it can\ntake away just as easily. The Union has no separate legal identity and derives\nits status from the Governing Body so as a consequence can not own\nanything.\nJCR Refectory Changeover\nAfter much debate by my predecessor it was decided that to improve the\nRefectory System in Sherfield Building the Refectories all had to be on the\nsame level because of the problems entailed in food transferal. To this end it\nwas agreed that the JCR and the Lower Dining Hall would be interchanged.\nThis work has now been started but due to delays and the plans of the\nSherfield Building being incorrect the program has had to be revised so that it\nwill be completed in segments over a period of three years. This year they\nhave removed the JCR bar and are building a fast food outlet to replace the\nButtery and have knocked a few holes in the wall for windows and are site ment of the door. The JCR will still be in operation at the start of the\nnext session so do not panic. It all seems to be going very smoothly and after\n24 years it is absolutely necessary to modernise.\nImpossible without:\nUnion Permanent Staff\nIt is so easy to take for granted the people who make life more easier for\nyou but although they have eased my way I greatly appreciate the amount of\ntime and effort that they have put in to ease my way. It has been a diff i cut year not only for us but for all of them and I cannot thank them enough. It is\nfortunate for IC Union that we have such people as Jen, Pat, Kathy, Norman,\nJulie, Tony, Rosemary and Moore in our employ.\nQuentin and Dave\nAlthoughmuch criticism has been hurled upon them, it would not have been\npossible for me to achieve anything if they had not been there to support me\nat the times when it really counted.\nExperience is not the be all and end all of a sabbatical what is most\nimportant is the willingness to learn, listen and communicate. It was rather\nunfortunate that nobody was willing to communicate with us, perhaps we\nsmell a bit, and this led to a lot of unnecessary and undesirable friction that\neverybody could have done better without.\nFinally\nNever before in the annals of IC Union has so much been done in so short a time by so few. The good that men do is oft interred with their bones but\nnevertheless I can only wish Christine, Jackie, Gutman and Dave the best of\nluck next year and hope that the good points more than compensate the bad.\nMay the Force be with you.\nCarl Burgess\nDeputy President\nDave Kingston\nThis report is an attempt to summarise the work that I have done the events and\nactivities that I have been involved with this year. It is of necessity in many places a personal view. I hope that those that I have criticised will think about what I have to\nsay and act on it if they agree with me.\nUGM'sI wonder from time to time whether they serve a useful function. They are rarely\nquo rate and despite being a forum for the public questioning of the sabbatical\nofficers, they rarely provide anything but trivial questions. I am convinced that an\nunscrupulous sabbatical could commit the Union to extremely damaging policies by\nhiding recommendations in a long winded report. Why are meetings so rarely\nquo rate? Not enough interesting motions is one answer, but who's fault is that?\nProceedural wrangling is another. It amazes me that the cream of the country's scientists and engineers cannot concentrate on something as simple as standing\nAt the end of last June we were budgeting for a \u00a35000 de fec it. Fortunately all of the\nmajor sub-committees under spent and then de fec it was covered even after the cost\nof half a boat was taken into account. Bookshop income has helped ease any\nworries for this year.\nNext year's estimates are proving to be source of difficulty with a number of people\nout to screw the Union for all it's worth. I would like to thank all of those who have\nhelped weed these ludicrous claims out. At the time of writing I am trying to leave a balanced budget for next year.\nOne problem for next year has been the five year plans for capital expenditure\nsystem. It appears that a number of clubs who have failed to obtain as much\nequipment as they would have like through their MSC or C CU have claimed for this\nunder five year plans over the last two or three years. I have moved some of these\nclaims back to where they belong thus creating some of the problems with the\nrecurrent expenditure estimates. However, this has been necessary so as to\nalleviate some of the pressure that the equipment fund under for next year.\nAnother real pain in the arse, has been the take over battle for the Distillers\ncompany in which we held shares. After bid and counter bid by the Argyll Group and\nGinnes, I accepted the final Guinness offer.\nMAJOR SUB COMMITTEES\nI have tended to regard my role on these more as observing them part a ici pate. This\nis largely because they have all been very well run and not needed control from\nabove.\nMINOR SUB-COMMITTEES\nthese have varied enormously from being useful to useless, this is largely\ndependant on the performance and quality of their relevant chairmen.\nTRANSPORT\nI am secretary to this. It meets more for the sake of meeting since Q, Kathy and\nJenny do all the work on a day to day basis and are the only ones who know w hafs happening anyway.\nINTERNAL SERVICES\nExcellently run by Alan Rose. Alan has been a model chairman. Not only has held\nregular meetings and developed the role of the committee as the Union has\ndeveloped this year, but has also put in a lot of work outside of the committee, it is\nunbelievable that this is the same committee that J Martin Taylor spent little time at\nbod g ing up last year. As a forum for discussing trading services it has been useful/\nAlan has made a valuable contribution to the running of the Bar, Snack Bar.\nbookshop and sports hop. EXTERNAL AFFAIRS\nGren fails to see what his relationship to this committee is, or indeed what the role of\nthe committee is. All too often EAC's have been just a discussion of the next GUC yet\nat the following Council meeting, a report is presented suggesting an incredible\namount of discussion on many and varied topics. Sub-committees are supposed to\ncarry out work at a level that Council does not have time for, and council assumes\nthat a chairman is reporting the views of his committee and not himself. What is even\nmore interesting is what has not been reported either to his committee or council,\nhow many people have heard about his discussions about NUS re a filli ation contrary\nto Council policy? Gren has in my view abused his own position so as to achieve his\nown aims. One wonders if it is any coincidence that a large proportion of EAC\nmeetings have been at 12.15 on a Monday when he has had a lecture to be at 1.30\nthus preventing any discussion on non-GUC material form taking place.\nFurthermore, I am still intrigued as to why he took ICU's copy of the University's accommodation survey from the Union Office without asking anyone\nWELFARE\nPete Wilson has been largely useless as a welfare officer, although this is not a reflection on his e thus i as m. Only two meetings have taken place, although this is\ntwo better than his three predecessors. His ideas are as ill thought out as Gren's and\nare frequently expensive with no realistic idea of a source of funds. This is a problem\nfaced by finance officers everywhere and is not specifically a criticism of Pete.\nENTS\nAfter arranging a good Freshers's week programme all we have been tea ted to is a bloody shambles. There has been a committee (of sorts) largely populated by\npeople more concerned with freeloading than organising events. See Welfare for\ncomments about money.\nACADEMIC AFFAIRS\nAnother year and another commit ee for J Martin Taylor. His talking shop style is\nmuch better suited to this than last year's Internal Services. If s a shame that the\nrabble collectively known as Dep Reps have not taken advantage of this.\nICCAG\norders, besides which there have been very few of these wrangles this year\nanyway. One answer that is not often promulgated is the fact that our quorum of 300 Do you know that the ICCAG chairman is an officer of the Union and sits on Council?\nis one of the highest that I have come across, and in fact our UGM attendance is I find it difficult to see why this is not an SCC club,\nbetter than most other London colleges. RAG\nCOUNCIL Rag has been it's usual roguish self and in doing so has rained more money than in\nCouncil has been dominated by a bunch of loud mouthed ego maniacs who appear previous years. The Rag Mag was again a source of trouble. It need not have been\nto discuss and decide issues with virtually no facts to work on, and attempt to had Tony Spencer listened to the sabbaticals. Neverthless the enthusiasm of\ndestroy and diminish anything that the sabbaticals and even UGMs do. Constructive people like tony is one ofthe reasons for Rag's success and not the uninspiring\ndiscussion only occurs when someone outside of this clique has a chance to get a word in edgeways (this is not Hugh Stiles' fault). I have a very low opinion of a body\nthat judges an officer's report on the basis of it's length, and not its content or the\namount of work done by that officer. Why is it that Council prefers long winded\nreports by officers who have done bugger all but put ill considered and ill discussed\nthoughts on paper and at lenght?\nEXEC\nThis is the converse of Council Roger, Dave, and Simon are a constant source of\nfresh ideas and are among the most dedicated of officers. This has been the most\nenjoyable of all committees despite most of the meetings being at some ungodly\nhour of the morning.\nFINANCE\nThe year started controversially with incidents concerning the Boat Club and\nIndustrial Society. Last year's Exec decided that a new racing eight should be\nbought for the Boat Club after Simon Errington had reported a massive under spend on the part of ACC. After their win at Henley, the new boat was ordered, only for\nSimon to report that ACC had spent more than he had thought due to two large bills\nhe had forgotten about. Fortunately, just as we were about to cancel the order for\nthe boat, College were persuaded to provide \u00a33000. Whilst I agree that expenditure\nperformance ofthe Chairman. The resurgence of interest in Rag in C& GU and\nRSMU provides one of the best reasons forthe continued existence of the CCUs.\nCAMPAIGNING\nICU has not been involved in much campaigning whilst I have been here, but this has improved this year, campaigns that I have been involved in have varied from the\nsmall turn out to the NUS 'Fowler' demonstration to the Harrods leafletting and the\nwidespread support by students for the AUT strike.\nBAR BOYCOTT\nThe biggest campaign by far was within the college, and was of course, the Bars\nBoycott. When we called it we were by no means convinced that it would be a success. The support of the students was amazing with College losing over \u00a312000\nin takings that week, I arranged special prom t ions during the week at the Norfolk\nTavern and the Merrie-go-Downe,. A rep from Arkelts told me that their sales to the\nMarrie-go-Down increased six-fold that week. If students support was excellent, the\nopposite could be said for the officers with only Alan Rose, Tim Palmer and Hugh\nStiles helping the Exec enforce the boycott. The boycott was a success in getting\nCollege to concede the principle. What was far more difficult was convincing the\nofficers who had done bugger all in the boycott to work towards the the take over.\nIndeed it seemed that these people were determined to block the transfer to Union\nof this sort of money should be decided by UFC, this was an exception. The decision control by imposing negotiating conditions upon us and creating an inflexible stance\nhad to be made when it was, and that is one of the reasons that you have executive\nofficers of a student's Union. Industrial society were a different problem. When we\ntook office, Industrial society were continuing to refuse to close down two outside\nbank accounts. They refused to talk constructively, so Carl and I suspended them\nfrom the Union. Negotiations commenced and after early intransigence on their\npart, Richard Eccleston and I reached a provisional agreement but UFC refused to\nfrom which we could not negotiate. Cart and I ignored the conditions that the one\nand only meeting of the Union Planning Group tried to impose and effected a good\nagreement with college and in time with out original plans. One does not ordinarily\nignore a committee decision, but in this case we were in a far better position to judge\nthe facts that anyone else. I think that so far we have been proved right.\nTRADING SERVICES\n\n"

    "content": "Annual Reports\nPresident\nCarl Burgess\nThe Annual Report of the ICU President\nIntroduction\nThis has been year of many changes ranging from a new Rector in the driving\nseat to a new Refectory Manager and all the ensuing events caused by this.\nThis report is an account of the year and includes my opinions on the Union\nand the College.\nWith only a year to achieve anything it is very difficult to promote change\nyet I feel that this year we managed to keep the Union dynamic and on its\ntoes. This has led to severe criticism of myself and my fellow sabbatical\nofficers by people who would rather see the union remain unchanged.\nMany people have also commented on and criticised my behaviour as\nPresident, thinking that I should act in a holier-than-thou manner to the\neveryday student. To those I say that I do not agree with them and refuse to\npretend to be someone I am not. The Handbook said 'This is your President,\nwhat have you let yourself in for?' Those who elected me knew what to\nexpect, those who didn't bother to vote have only got themselves to blame.\nThe Union and Its Committees\nUGMs\nThis year again there has only been one quo rate UGM, the first one. This is\nvery disappointing as it is supposed to be the sovereign body of IC Union and\nhence creates policy which affects all students at this college. Many people\nwho did turn up were not interested in what the sabbaticals were doing but\nonly in motions pertaining to the Rag Mag, Women's Officer, Barclay's Bank,\nNicaraguan Coffee etc and leaving once their motion had been heard. The\nmeetings were ably chaired by Chris Hendy who had to deal with a particularly obnoxious rabble on some occasions. I am particularly sorry for\nMichael Newman, who put forward a motion on Union Organisation which\nwas never heard. He had put forward radical proposals to change the face of\nICU but nobody appeared to be interested, it seems that people are quite\ncontent to take part in the club or society activity but not in the decision\nmaking process that governs their facilities, money or even existence. I sometimes wonder whether they think that their club funds and equipment\nmagically appear for their use.\nWhatever the reasons for non-attendance, be it alternative events arr aged by\nsocieties clashing, be it lack of publicity, be it general disinterest, the UGM is\nnot just a practical for budding Aeronautical engineering students.\nCouncil\nCouncil almost went very smoothly under the cool control of Pub Board\nChairman Hugh Stiles but un fortuna tley certain officers with a love of seeing\ntheir names in the minutes were unnecessarily verbose and downright\nobstructive. They have yet to realise that a little incorrect knowledge is far\nworse than absolutely no knowledge at all. They need to take their heads out\nof the ground and see that the world is never black or white but just a rather\nunattractive shade of grey.\nNevertheless, although many hours were spent in pointless debate, all that\nwe wanted to happen has occured.\nThe absence of the Departmental Representatives is as usual as it is\nmysterious. I cannot work out whether they either do not know what their jobs\nentail or whether they can't find the Union office or haven't discovered that it\nexists yet.\nIt is typical of such a body to produce a patent report measure r to enable\nreports to be referred back if they are not long enough.\nThe Executive\nIn direct contrast to Council the Executive was a very ple sant affair. It was\nvery nice to work with intelligent, objective and helpful officers such as Dave\nPearce, Roger Preece, Simon Redlich, Dave Kingston and Quentin Fontana\nwho helped formulate the polices we undertook to carry out this year.\nWe have had to have twice as many meetings this year than last year, a lot\nto do with the major changes in the running of the Union but also to deal with\nan incredibly large number of disciplinary matters. I hope that the number of\ndiscipline cases drops next year as it is getting quite out of hand.\nMajor Sub-committees\nI have not been to as many of these as I would have liked for a variety of\nreasons including timetable clashes with other meetings, not receiving the\nnotification of the meetings and various other unanticipated occur en ces that\nmerited my attention.\nHowever those that I did attend were very competently run and were quite\npainless affairs and so I must thank the MSC Chairman for all their time and\neffort in administering their clubs and societies. Ian Bull had asked for all\noutgoing MSC Chairman to write a job description and all salient details\npertaining to the job which would be given to the incoming MSC chairman so\nthat they would know more fully what was necessary to be done. I can only\nreiterate this request as it can only help the smooth running of the Union.\nACC\nThere have been a few hiccoughs with ACC this year mainly due to Simon\nErrington, who started out as ACC chairman not being able to decide at the\nstart of session whether he was going to do his PhD or not. He eventually did\nnot and so had to resign without leaving the necessary information behind for\nhis successor Paul Dubenski. This led to a lack of communication between\nPaul and myself, since I had assumed that, Simon had briefed him on ail the\nrelevant details of the Harlington gravel extraction which will be later in the\nreport. Having said this the clubs have performed very well this year winning\nmany cups but I shall leave the details of that to the ACC Annual report. RC C Again this year, faced with a cut in funding, subscriptions had to be increased\nin line with the cost of the activity and the tour subsidy had to be reduced.\nTim Palmer achieved this with the minimum of fuss or complaints.\nNevertheless the participation in most clubs was not affected and a high level\nof activity was maintained. It would however be very helpful if clubs would\nnotify the chairman if they are not going to continue their activites in the\nfollowing year so that their funds and resources can be reallocated.\nSCAB Under the able guiding hand of Nick Shackley SCAB has continued to excel\nin all areas. Unfortunately problems arose with the Choir and Orchestra\nbudgets. They attempted to oust Nick from the College Music Committee as\nthey felt he couldn't properly represent them as he was in neither society.\nFortunately this was defeated. Also the College Music Society refused to\nincrease its allocation to these societies expecting the Union to foot the bill\nwhich due to our Financial intransigence we are unable to do.\nsec\nYet again we have had the hardy perennial problem of Industrial Society and\ntheir 'secret' bank accounts, lack of accountability and inability to answer\nphone messages thus cluttering up our receptionist with unnecessary\nrepeated calls. Richard Eccleston drew up a proposal to sort this out in a mutually acceptable fashion but Finance Committee, in their infinite wisdom,\ndecided that they should be able to spend 'their' money how they liked. I wish\nnext years sabbaticals luck cleaning with this problem, because its not going\nto go away by itself.\nAnother perennial problem is Ultra Vires which we have had to look at\nespecially in respect to affiliations to political groups and campaigns. A close\nscrutiny will have to be kept next year.\nAnother problem is political societies inviting potentially hazardous\nspeakers to talk at their meetings. Infiltration by pressure groups from other\ncolleges to incite trouble has been known to happen. This has now to be kept\nunder even greater control since the Freedom of Speech and Lawful Assembly\ndocument from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals has been\nbrought out.\nCorrection\nThe following lines were missed from the Hon See's report they should be inserted between columns 2\nand 3.\nthis committee is that the chairman has been dealing with item's and campaigns\nbehind the back of the committee with almost no reference to it.\n4a Welfare Committee: This has been similar in many ways to the External Affairs\nCommittee in that there hasn't been much discussed.The first meeting of this\ncommittee was in January meaning that there were no meetings in the whole of the\nfirst term. The January meeting was only held due to the Welfare Officer being\ninstructed to by Council so that constitutional changes could be di cussed. In the\nevent the Welfare Officer's prop oss als were greatly altered. The problems at this\ncommittee, were unlike External Affairs, more due to the in com pet ance of the\nchairman than a malicious intent to dec i eve for personal political reasons.\n4h House, Catering and Bar CommitteesThese have all performed adequately\nwithin their own spheres of influence, any problems that have been encountered\nhave been due to individual bungling outside the committee rather than any\ninherent problem. The meetings were somewhat lacking in frequency however.\n4i Executive Committee: As a committee this has worked very well this year, mainly\ndue to a genuine concern for the good of the IC Union. Council hasn't always agreed\nthe Executive but the Exec has normally been proved right in the end.\n4j Transport Committee: This is the main committee which I chair and as such my\ncomments may be somewhat biased. The main problem with this committee is that it\nis mainly composed of people who have little to do with the direct running of the\ntransport system except as users so their input cannot be expected to be extensive.\nAs such the committee has been almost a rubber stamp and a means of recording\nwhat has been going on. I have been the major speaker with Jerry, the Transport\nOfficer, being the only other regular contributor. A major change that I have made\nwith this committee is to dispense with bookings, apart from tours, and concentrate\non the practical side of the system such as the administrative system, pricing\nstructure and ve chile policy. It may sound as if the committee has been run as a "

It came to me by\nairmail (ie wrapped around a flying brick which was\ndelivered via the window) and\nbegins:\nDear Short Scruffy Git,\nI am an engineering student.\nYou probably won't know what\none of them is so I will explain.\nWe are the poor hard-working\nbastards who are supposed to\nbecome tomorrow's Captains of\nIndustry.

    "content": "It just remains for me to wish the Union (that means all its members s not just the officers) a fond farewell and that I hope that Dave and Christine and Jackie has a good a year as I have just re mm ber the words attributed to a famous black student leader: 'Bloody\nstudents, they give me so much gr rie f, they really piss me off.\nAcademic Affairs\nJ Martin Taylor\nThis year has seen the beginning of a process which may (or may not) lead to real\nchanges in teaching methods at the College. With the arrival of a new Rector, along\nwith evidence that the College's reputation for teaching is becoming tarnished (as\nevidenced by the dramatic fall in the number of applicants), the College set up an\nUndergraduate Studies Committee to produce proposals designed to re vital is e teaching. This committee, with its large student membership (which does not\ninclude myself), has spent all year in intense deliberations, and has addressed itself\nto all the age-old student complaints about lecturers who can't lecture, too heavy\nwork-loads, etc. Unfortunately it has not yet produced its first set of proposals, and\nalthough in draft form they look quite radical, I think the present delay is because\nthey are being watered-down in order to stand any chance of being accepted by\nBoard of Studies.\nIt's the same old story - there is always a perfectly good reason why any particular\nchange shouldn't be made. Everyone agrees on the need for some change, but\nwhatever is proposed, whilst always a 'good idea in principle', cannot be put into\naction because of some over-riding reason. My feeling is that what will eventually be\napproved will be token window dressing designed to justify having gone through the\nentire process, with the real problems and their potential solutions remaining\nunaddressed. Academics are still too stuck in their comfortable ways to make any\nhard decisions about the future of higher education, something which I find\nprofoundly depressing.\nCOLLEGE COMMITTEES\nThe most useful committee I attend as AAO is Admissions Policy. The members are\nAdmissions Tutors who are all interested in students and they are deeply worried\nabout falling applications. It is unfortunate that their concern has not permeated to\nall parts of the College, although I believe it is shared by the Rector.\nBoard of Studies is a fascinating body. It consists of a very large number of people,\nall the professors and many lecturers, and is chaired by the Rector. It is the highest\nacademic body in College. It makes decisions by consensus, which means in\npractice that if what is suggested meets with the Rector's approval it is the\nconsensus, and if it doesn't it isn't. Occasionally the Rector can't make up his mind\nand must judge what the mood of the meeting is. I will treasure the moment when\nthe Rector, after explaining that votes are never taken at BoS, asked for a show of\nhands to 'indicate the feeling of the Board'. BoS is basically a conservative body\nwhich makes any radical change difficult to achieve. Occasionally this works to our\nadvantage, but more often than not it is a major obstacle to reform.\nOther College committees I sit on include Vacation Training which has at last\nrealised why student reps didn't turn up - they never sent any notifications to the\nUnion. We are now playing a part in this again. Most discussion is hampered by a lack of statistics on how many students actually get vacation work through the\nCollege scheme. Careers Advisory has only met once and unfortunately I wasn't able to attend.\nI have also been a member of the Rector's Working Party on increasing the number\nof women students. This he set up after setting the ambitious target in his\nCommemoration Day speech of doubling the proportion of women at IC by 1992.\nThis working party, after some initial discussions, has arranged a series of two day\ncourses for sixth form girls in the summer. This is laudable, but offers little hope of\nmeeting the Rector's target given the limited numbers involved. Unfortunately the\nwider problem is largely outside the College's control, for example only 20% of\nPhysics A level entrants are female.\nACADEMIC AFFAIRS DAY\nThis took place for the first time in February, and I believe it was very successful. It\nconsisted of a speech and discussion with the chairman of the UG Studies\nCommittee, Prof. Blow, training exercises and discussion of Academic Affairs policy.\nI am glad that I have been able to start up what I hope will be a regular annual event\nwhich should improve the Union's Academic Affairs work. Ideally the event will be\nheld early in the session, and I believe my sucess or is already arranging it for the\nautumn term.\nALTERNATIVE PROSPECTUS\nThe AAC decided in the autumn term that it was unhappy with the decision not to\nproduce an AP this year. The decision was bad for a number of reasons - the\nprevious AP was seriously out of date, and was never intended when it was\nproduced to cover two years; the idea that schools will keep the old editions for\nanother year is unrealistic. In addition there is the argument that it is an important\nfunction of a student union to provide a student view to potential applicants to the\nCollege. Unfortunately the Union took a narrow financial view of the AP.\nI decided therefore to get the College to pay for the AP, since it is after all part of the\nCollege's overall recruitment effort, and a good AP is likely to encourage the right\npeople to choose IC. I won the support of the Admissions Policy Committee and the\nRector's Working Party on Women Students, but unfortunately time ran out before\nthe matter could be raised at a high enough level. I feel that we would have been\nsuccessful in obtaining the \u00a32500 we needed if there had been any support from the\nPresident, with his access to the Rector. Unfortunately, for convoluted reasons,\nvarious people including Carl Burgess decided they didn't want an AP this year and\nremained resolutely opposed to the idea even if College agreed to pay for it. It\nseems there are people prepared to oppose any idea simply because I'm in favour\nof it - but then that's student politics.\nIC UNION\nThis has been the worst year for the Union in the seven years I have been a student\nhere. We have undoubtedly the most in com pet ant, lazy and inexperienced\nleadership' that I have ever seen. They have succeeded in dividing the few active\nmembers of the Union as never before, and reducing interest in and respect for the\nUnion amongst its members to a new low. Fortunately, the College realise that this is\na one year problem and it hasn't affected their view of the Union too badly. But it is\nimpossible for the Union to expect to take on more responsibility when there is\nalways the threat of another year like this one. The lesson to all members of the\nUnion is clear - if you elect joke candidates to top jobs in the Union, then you will get\na Union which is itself a joke.\nJ Martin Taylor\nInternal Services\nAlan Rose\nSection A: Trading Outlets\n1. The Union Snack Bar\nThis outlet has consolidated its position after a very good first year and should\nreturn a larger surplus this year.\nSpace has continued to be the root of most problems, the main two being the large\nslow moving queues at peak periods and the lack of space to sit down and eat at\nthese times. To streamline the point of sale it is hoped that an additional microwave\noven and an extra till will be introduced by the start of the new year.\nExpansion into the area of externally sold food production (eg providing rolls for the\nbar) has increased productivity without a POS bottleneck overhead but has\nnecessitated the introduction of an additional employee. As the associated\npreparation work takes place in the morning, student casuals are generally\nunavailable. Suitable external candidates proved difficult to attract, eventually\nresulting in the arrival of an ex-IC student who had time on his hands. Whilst Pete\nHartley has done a great job, he may be resuming his \"studies\" at some stage and\nso we will be stuck with the same problem again.\nAlthough the Wednesday evening opening was hardly a howling success, it did not\nlose any money and is indicative of future bar/snack bar policy which will hopefully\ninvolve both outlets working together.\n2. The Book Shop\nAfter the \u00a31000 deficit of 1984, the 1985 surplus of \u00a327000 showed that the\nproblems were temporary, a fact born out by the recent half-yearly accounts which\nindicate that the shop should show an improved performance this year.\nThe book stalls organised by Mr Hicks, the shop manager, for the various\nconferences that have taken place at college this year have continued to be\nsuccessful.\nBecause of the fact that much of the shop's stock is dictated by the book lists submitted by members of academic staff, the stock levels and hence the shop's financial fluidity can often be adversely affected by thoughtlessly cobbled together\nlists. This will always be a problem but it appears to have caused less damage this\nyear than last.\nLike IC Union itself, the Book Shop is poised to move into the computer age. An\naccounting package is in the process of being into duce d and hopefully a stock\ncontrol package will be implemented before the start of the next academic year.\nJason Gold of the finance section has produced much invaluable work to aid this\nproject as well as all of the new technology will be to liberate the shop's management staff from a lot of tedious paperwork, enabling them to explore such\nareas as sales to outside organisations like technically based firms and other\ncolleges which is the only way forward as intern a j sales reach saturation point.\n3. The Sports Shop\nContrary to some of the ill-informed piffle in sabbatical election publicity last term,\nthe Sports Shop looks set to return a small profit this year after last year's small loss.\nIt is true to say that the shop still has outstanding debts from some time ago and it\nwill certainly need some form of re-vamp in the not too distant future.\nAt the beginning of the year, one of the shops main suppliers went out of business.\nThe fact that this company was NUS re com mede d is entirely consistent with that\norganisation's attitude towards trading which has always been little short of\ncretinous. The shop has pulled through well and new suppliers have been found.\nThe business has undergone a certain amount of streamlining this year with stock\nlevels being reduced and opening hours being adjusted to meet demand.\n4.The Union Bar\nThe January takeover of the Bar was brought about by a quite excellent popular\nresponse to the boycott and a great deal of discussion and haggling both within the\nUnion and between the Union and College.\nAlthough the end .result was inevitably imperfect the financial and administrative\nimplications of the takeover were moulded into a workable format. This was greatly\naided by;\na) A lot of hard work and investigation by Sabbatical officers, (particularly from Dave\nKingston)\nb) Co-operation and advice from the Refectory system, (particularly from Martin\nParsons).\nc) Informed and constructive criticism from Union Officers, (particularly from Nick\nShackley).\nd) Help and advice from other student bars (particularly from ULU).\nAnd was hindered by;\na) Ill-informed destructive criticism from Union Officers (particularly from Gren\nManuel)\nb) ill-conceived badly worded takeover agreements.\nSince the takeover the bar's takings have shown a steady increase up to a point\nwhere they are now on a par with last year's performance. A few minor\nadministrative hassles have come to light but should soon be ironed out.\nThis has been greatly aided by;\na) The hard work and patience of Union staff (particularly Jen, Mooore and Kevin)\nb) Most of the bar's customers.\nAnd has been hindered by;\na) Very bad attitudes from some 'customers' (most of whom have been from rugby\nclubs but I'm sure this is a coincidence)\nSECTION B NEW DEVELOPMENTS\n1. Machinery\nPete Wilson decided that the Southside Bar toilets needed a Durex dispenser. This\nwas installed last term and appears to be doing good business. Whether he thinks it\nis still a good idea after all pe uri le jokes he has had to endure over the last few\nmonths is another matter.\nI investigated the pos sibi l ty of installing a stamp machine and to this day I am\nwaiting for Automated Postage Services Ltd to iron out problems with their\nmachinery.\nThe idea of asking one of the High Street banks to install a Cash Point on campus\nwas mooted. Lloyds were originally interested but after pre longed discussions with\ntheir development department, the College Secretary, the Finance Section and the\nMech Eng Departmental Superintendent, Lloyds finally pulled out.\n2. Refurbishment\nIn order to attract more students into the Union Building, it was decided that the\nroom m which now houses both the Union Snack Bar and the Union Lounge Bar\nshould have a major facelift. This should make the room much more functional as a snack bar and make it somewhere where people can come for a quiet drink inn the\nevenings.

    "content": "This generally went well but publicity on both our part and that of the CCUs was bad\nand we suffered from a lack of attendance at a lot of events. 1 wish I could have had\na publicity officer as keen as Nick Shackley. The only new event was the Hypnosis\nlecture which went very well despite poor publicity. Apart from this all the events\nother than the street collections and carnival were better organised than before and\nraised more money. On a personal note I thought that Morphy Day was great fun\nand was the highlight of rag week.\nRag Mags\nI hope that Jelly produces something that is not as sick as this year and I wish him\nlots of luck. We only ran a couple of tours to other London colleges (which I did not\ngo on) and most of the rag mags were sold at the beginning of term and on the RCS\ntrip. One reason for this being that the printer only let us have a couple of hundred at\na time. Next year's committee should think about producing more which could be\nsold with a few trips in the first term.\nParachuting\nA good idea of Judith Hackney's which unfortunately suffered from lots of cock-ups.\nWe should still have raised about \u00a32000 from it. Our Valentine's Day Milk Tray\nmessage idea didn't go so well, Hugh Southey's mum being the only person to take\nadvantage of it. All the rest of my ideas such as Beit pancake races were\nconveniently forgotten about.\nRag Fete\nThis was organised very well by Man Tai with a little bit of help from myself. The\nparty worked out very well and most people got extremely pissed. Carl was already\npissed at 9.00am on the same morning and was extremely obnoxious to Anne\nDiamond. Anne Diamond did not wear Tony Spencer's jumper on TV-AM.\nGeneral Comments\nThis year we have raised about \u00a313,000 (+ \u00a35000). Next year's charities are\nNational Deaf Children, Cancer Research, RADAR, Brain injured children and a local group of Mencap. We are not supporting any African charities so go and run in\nHyde Park for Sport Aid.\nI would like to wish the best of luck to Man Tai and hope all the VPs get involved in\nRag Committee, bring their friends along and make the chairman s job a lot easier. I have enjoyed my year but wish that people would realise there is a limit to what you\ncan do. I would probably have done a lot more if I hadn't got pissed off half way\nthrough the first term due to excess hassles.\nRCC Chairman\nTim Palmer\nThis year for RCC has gone well, the RCC Exec has worked well, with Peter Hill, the\nVice Chairman running the accounts smoothly on and giving a helpful second\nopinion. Simon Seward, Jerry Hassnip and d Richard Collcott have all helped keep\nthe committee running smoothly. Frank Potter, RCC Hon Senior treasurer, has\nbeen invaluable as ever.\nThe clubs have had varying success this year, a lot depending on the personalities .\nand drive of people in them. A successful club generally has a hard working\nchairman and committee.. During the year, we lost Brewing Society due to lack of\ninterest. Chinese Chess Soociety joined RCC just before Christmas, providing us\nwith a new and different club. Astrosoc's committee h aave requested to be\ntransferred back too RCSU next year and Simon Redlich, RCSU President and I have agreed on this. Therefore next year, RCC will have only 28 clubs under its\ncontrol rather than the 29 I have had this year.\nAs for the other clubs, Keep fit have had a very successful second year with\nmembership almost double that of last year. Dance, and Billliards and Snooker\nhave some pleasing successes in competitions, with Dance also expanding their\nrange of lessons. Canoe and Caving this year have produced two potentially\nexciting expeditions to the Karokoram and the Rockies respectively which give\nsome indic cation of the high degree of expertise in these and other RCC clubs.\nFinancially this year has been tight. With care having to be exercised though out the\nwhole range of RCC finance. Next year, the same is going to be true. Although if\nUFC gets its way we may lose certain clubs which the 'Union' believes spend too\nmuch. This I believe is a very dangerous approach to take especially as we then\nhave to prior it is e our expenditure. This is NOT possible inn an organisation like the\nUnion which provides as service. I also believe we are still living in a 'land of milk and\nhoney' to some extent compared to the 'real' world, therefore everyone could take\nthe cuts needed with attacking certain clubs.\nI have enjoyed my year as RCC chairman and wish my successor and his Exec luck\nwith the next year. Success will as always depend on people rather than money.\nSCAB Chairman\nNick Shackley\nThe past year has seen a maintenance of the Board's activities with pleasing\ngrowth by a number of The Board's constituent clubs, despite continuing financial\npressure. I shall briefly detail the activities of The Board's societies.\nThe Chamber Music Society has not been active this year and its exact role in the\nmusical activities of students remains unclear. However, the recent appointment of\nRichard Dickens as 'musician in residence' by the College should aid its\nemergence next year. The Debating Society has held fewer debates involving\noutside speakers and has therefore been less visible to the general student\naudience but the involvement of its members in debates and the introduction of\ndebating workshops has proved succesful and popular.\nThe Dramatic Society has been as active as ever with three major productions and\nSCAB Nite being performed; two radio plays have been produced for broadcast on\nIC Radio, which have ensured the involvement of most members interested in\nacting. The 1985 tour to the Edinburgh Festival proved succesful; with no major\ndifficulties being encountered either in the running of the theatre venue (Theatre\nWest End), which involves considerable organisation throughout the year, or in the\nperformance of the Society's three plays.\nThe reformed Jazz Club has emerged this year and the efforts of a few in getting\nthe Club off the ground have been most succesful. Bands using the Club's facilities\nhave performed at SCAB Nite, Rag and RCS parties, as well as providing music in\nthe Union Bar, and the Club has organised a couple of its own gigs in the Lounge.\nAlso, a Big Band has been formed and is practising regularly. The Operatic Society\nenjoyed its traditional success with their February show, as well as performing at\nChristmas and at Easter. The tour to Devon, completely self-financing, went very\nsmoothly with good houses for all performances. The help and cooperation of last\nyear's Tour administrators has been most useful in sorting out the perennial VAT\nproblems.\nThe Choir has maintained its activity over the previous year with well-attended\nconcerts at Christmas and Easter, the installation of an organ in the Great Hall\nbeing a major asset to them. Some difficulties in their intensive rehearsals,\nessential for sufficient par act is e, have resulted in lower attend en ces. The\nOrchestra has seen improved attendances at its Christmas and Easter concerts,\nnot least due to the hard work of their committee, and the joint concert at Easter\nwith the Choir was a highlight and notable success for both parties.\nAll SCAB societies participated in SCAB Nite which was attended by about 200\npeople this year. Autumn is always a busy term for the SCAB clubs and I am most\ngrateful to all concerned for their efforts.\nThe hiring out of projectors and PA by the Executive continue with usage\nremaining broadly the same as the previous year. These items have remained a source of hassle and the loss by Ents of the PA speakers at the beginning of the\nAutumn term left Jazz Club in a difficult position just when it was getting off the\nground. The maintenance of this equipment is expensive and costs are barely\nbeing covered at the moment.\nThe Board now oversees six accounts and a degree of coordination is necessary,\npart icu a rly when sorting out the end-of-year VAT and returnable balance\npayments. I am grateful to Malcolm Walker of Finanace Section for his help in this\narea but it will take a couple of years for The Board to get used to this new role and\nthe help of the individual treasurers, which has been excellent this year, will always\nbe required. The computer is ation of the SCAB account has proved successful\nalthough the lack of a computer in the Union Office has complicated matters\nsomewhat; this will be remedied next year, I understand. The new, separate\naccounts for the Choir and Orchestra have proved successful, fully justifying the\ndecision of the two commit ees to go ahead with the change. The existing\nproposals regarding next year's funding by the College of Choir and Orchestra are\nmost unsatisfactory and this issue will continue to be per sued by the The Board\nuntil a fair and appropriate allocation is made.\nDuring the last two years, I have represented the Union on the newly formed\nCollege Music Commitee. Overall, I have been impressed with the willingness of\nthis commit ee to tackle the basic problems faced by the musical societies in the\nCollege. However, the commit ee must not be reticent in dealing with the financial\nsituation regarding College funding to musical activities. The belligerence of any\none individual must be overcome to ensure a satisfactory outcome for all parts of\nmusic at the College.\nFinally I would like to thank all members of The Board for their time and help over\nthe past year. Financial pressure, from all quarters, and the difficulties of\ncoordinating all our financial activities is not at all easy and their interest and\n. support has been essential and very much appreciated. In particular, I would like\nto thank Dr Don Munro for his work as Orchestra staff treasurer, a post he is,\nregrettably, giving up this year and the SCAB executive. In particular, I am\nindebted to The Board's senior treasurer, Professor Bill Wakeham, for a sense of\nhumour, an adroit signature and two years of amusing Thursday lun c times. Welfare Officer\nPete Wilson\n\"Dave Kingston has been largely useless as a Deputy President\". Recognise this\nphrase? It is the one which Dave Kingston used to describe my work for the Union\nover the last year. Neither statement is very constructive.\nI think I can best report my actions as Welfare Officer this year by answering\nDave's crit is isms. Of course during the year, my first as a Union Officer, I have had\nmy short comings, but then even Sabbaticals have short comings.\nDave crit is is es my ideas as being ill thought out, and with no realistic idea of\nfunding. Each year the Union receives a quarter of a million pounds from College.\nDo you think spending an extra \u00a3200 pounds a year on a more effective rape\nalarm, to be given free to women students, is ill thought out. Do you think spending\na few pounds a week on a minibus service to take students from the 'campus' to\nthe head tenancies, after the bars have closed, is a waste of your money? Dave\nKingston, and the other sabbaticals, refuse to even consider either of these ideas.\nI spent a lot of time in the second term attempting to find a solution to the 'Nightline\nCrisis'. The problem, simply, is that the funding has collapsed, and Imperial\nCollege ( not the Union ) has kept it going for the last year. I wrote to every\nSabbatical of every ULU College, and to every student newspaper, pointing out\nthe situation, and asking for money or publicity. However Colleges and Unions\nwere, at the time, unwilling to come up with the thirty pence, per student, which\nwould enable Nightline to survive.\nAnne Cox, the Nightline director, and I approached the Rector and the College\nTutor, who both agreed that the bottom line was Nightline is a valuable Service,\nwhich should not be allowed to collapse. As the solution to the problem is obviously\nLondon wide, and as I had exams looming, I left the situation in the more than\ncapable hands of the ULU president.\nFinally I would like to thank Anne Cox, Leslie Gillingham, and everyone else at\nStudent Services, on behalf of the Union, for their hard work. I would like to wish\nDave Kingston the best of luck in his career outside of college.\nAn afterthought; if you're interested enough to have read this far, then you will\nprobably have read the sabbatical reports as well. You should take them all with a pinch of salt, as it seems that Carl, Dave and Quentin have indulged themselves in\nmutual back-slapping, and a fair degree of back stabbing. Did you really want\nthese children running your Union. Roll on next year\n\n"

    "content": "The Week In Science\nTime Out Meets Tomorrow's World\nAids: The Search For A Cure\nThe fight goes oo on to try to find a cure or vaccine for acquired\nimmune deficiency syn d rom( AIDS). A cure cannot come to\nsoon-by March this year 10,000 people had died from aids,\nand 8,000 are dying now. The aids death toll in Britain alone will\nbe 3,000 by 1989 according to the public health laboratory in\nLondon. More than 160 people have already died form Aids in\nthe UK since it was discovered in nn1981. Aids is caused by a virus-a roughly spherical bundle of protein\ncontaining a single strand of the nucl lei c acid RNA. Viruses\nwork by invading host cells' and they are usually specific too\nquite a narrow range of hosts. The aids vii rus is specific to\nT lymph occ y lee cells. The virus binds to the surface of the cell,\nand the viral RNA and protein are injected. An enzyme in teh\nvirus called reverse trans rip t as e, transcribes the viral RNA into\nDNA which can then be in corp po rated into the host cell's genes. The viral genes stage a takover of the cell's machinery,\nand instruct it to produce replicas of the infecting virus particles\nare produced that the cell simply bursts. Alternatively the virus\nparticles can be released one at a time, while the host cell\ncontinues to live, grow, and re pr duce. Either way, the new viruses can then go off in search of more cells to infect and kill.\nAnother theory is that the virus causes the T lymphocyte cells\nto produce ly m mph to oo toxins which kill the cells\nThe cells that aids destroys-Tl lymphocyte cells- are special\nwhite blood cells produced to the thymus (a gland in the k neck) They are vital to the body's defence me can is m, which in a healthy person produces antibodies to ward off invading cells\nor viruses, in a patient suffering from Aids, the lymph ho cyte s are killed and the defence mechanism breaks down. Patients\ndo not die from Aids- they die form one of many different\na ill ment s that the defence mechanism would ordinarily deal\nwith.\nAs soon as scientists discovered that Aids was caused by a virus, they began to look for a vaccine to use against it.\nVaccines work by initiating the production of antibodies specific\nfor the virus. The antibodies bind to the virus and render it\nunable to invade the host cell. But unfortunately it has been impossible, so far, to produce a vaccine specific for Aids,\nbecause the virus responsible for Aids keeps changing its\nconfiguration. And it is difficult to be specific for something that\nkeeps changing. The approach to the problem being adopted by some scientists\nis to find some part of the virus that does not change. The most\nlikely candidate so far seems to be a component of the virus\ncoat, a protein called GP120. GP120 has been purified from\ncultured Aids virus and injected into animals. The animals\nproduce antibodies which, in the test tube, kill the Aids virus.\nThe next stage in testing this, or any other vaccine, will be to\n\"challenge\" vaccinated animals with Aids virus, and see if it\naffords protection: tests could then begin on humans. One researcher has expressed the gene for GP120 in\nvaccinia the virus from which the smallpox vaccine is made. Vaccinia is extremely good at transferring foreign genes into\nhost cells. Meanwhile other researchers are busy looking for\nother antigen sites on the Aids virus - sites that will elicit the\nproduction of antibodies.\nIt is clear, however, that any Aids vaccine is some years away.\nIn the t short term the quest is for a drug that will cure Aids\nvictims, rather than a vaccine that will prevent the disease taking hold. A drug developed by the Wellcome Laboratories,\na zi do thymi dine, is showing promise in early trials. After using\nthe drug for six weeks,15 out of 19 patients showed increases\nin the n uber of T lymphocyte cells in their blood. Five other\ndrugs are in the first stages of human testing, but anti-viral\ndrugs in Aids therapy must be able to cross the blood-brain\nbarrier, and so far only a zi do thymi dine seems able to do this\nand them only in some patients.\nThe best treatment at present is a drug to attack the virus,\ncombined with antibiotics, and interferon to try to repair the\nimmune system. But the most that can be done at present is\nprolong the victims.\nThe anti-viral drugs are designed to attack reverse\ntranscriptase, the viral enzyme described above that is\nessential to the virus's deadly function. Researchers in the US have succeded in determining the amino acid sequence of the\nenzyme: this should make it possible to design a better\nanti-enzyme drug.\nA completely different concept of Aids recovery is to remove\nthe bone marrow of patients andre pal ce it with healthy marrow\nfrom their ident i a cl twins: this has been attempted with three\nmale patients, but the results are not yet available.\nAids: Governments React\nGovernment's all over the world are waking up to the dangers,\nreal and imagined, of Aids. In Britain, the de apartment of health\nhas put full-page advertise mant s in the national press, advising\nof the dangers of rectal intercourse and using dirty needles for\ninjections. In California a law has been proposed that would\nallow compulsory Aids checks when there is a 'compelling\npublic health need'.\nThe US government proposes to close its borders to anyone\nwith Aids which will join leprosy, TB and syphilis on the list of\ndangerous contagious diseases. Saudi Arabia has banned imports of b bod, in an attempt to\nstem the spread of Aids. Saudi Arabian citizens are being\noffered new incentives to donate blood so that the country can become self-sufficient. Kuwait has set up the Middle East's first\nAids research centre following a conference on the disease held there in March. In Britain, the blood transfusion service now checks routinely\nfor Aids virus, hepatitis B and syphilis.\nMeanwhile, the. popularity of 'dips' at Hollywood parties has declined enormously.\nAids: Name The Virus\nA lot of controversy over Aids centres on the name used for its\nvirus. Two of the main protagonists in Aids research are\nembroiled in a bitter row over the name, and a committee,\nchaired by Professor Harold Var mus, has been deliberating on the subject for more than a year.\nThe evidence that the Aids-causing agent is a virus came from\nDr Luc Montagnier at the Institut Pasteur, Paris. He produced\nan electron micro graph showing virus-like particles which he\ncalls lymph a de no path yas so cited virus (LAV).\nSoon afterwards Dr Robert Gallo at the US National Institutes\nof Health showed that virus-like particles isolated from Aids patients were able to infect lymphocytes in culture. Gallo calls\nhis virus human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-III). Further\nresearch has since shown these two vi r sues to be essentially\nthe same. Last year techniques for the diagnoses of Aids were developed\nseperate ly by the two groups. The Pasteur Institute has filed a law suit against the US group, which has patented the\ndiscovery, on the grounds that the US technique was developed using material supplied by Montagnier\nMatters were made even worse when it was discovered that\nGallo had inadvertently used an electron micro graph of the\nFrench virus in his first paper on the subject.\nThe compromise name used so far has been HTLV-III/LAV, but\nthe Var mus committee has tentatively suggested human\nimmunodeficiency virus as the new name. Gallo has said that he will not go along with HIV; he was incensed when Montagnier used the term at a lecture before it\nhad appeared in a learned journal, against Var mus's strict\ninstructions.\nThe argument over the name seems somewhat trivial, and almost childish. It is worrying, though, that two of the leading\nresearch teams in the subject should appear to be at\nloggerheads.\n*Two new Aids viruses have recently been discovered, one by\nthe Paris group and another by the US group. The names given to them are LAV// and HTLV-IVrespectively. L4V// has so far only been found in two Senegal men. HTLV-IV seems to\nbe related to the Aids virus, without actually causing Aids\nsymptoms. "

The\nincrease was decided at the\nStudent Residence Committee\n(SRC) on Wednesday, and was\nnot opposed by Union\nrepresentatives at the meeting.\nThe rise also brings a restructuring in the relative\nprices of halls and houses. The\nmore popular halls in Princes\nGardens receive large increases\nof up to \u00a35 per week, whilst\nhouses have in certain cases\nbeen reduced. Bernard Sunley\nand Mining Houses are to\nreceive rent cuts of between \u00a31\nand \u00a32 per week, however the\nupgraded houses like Willis\nJackson and Holbein receive\nsmall increases.\nThe committee report claimed\nthat even the highest rent of\n\u00a332.66 is lower than the average\nprivate sector rent paid by IC\nstudents of \u00a335 per week from\ndata supplied by Student\nServices.\nWeeks and Linstead Halls are\nto become the most expensive\naccommodation with single\nrooms costing \u00a332.66 and\n\u00a331.61 respectively, increased\nfrom \u00a327.30.

The decision\nwill now be postponed until\njoint Council on Monday June\n16.\nEarlier Council had voted to\naward final colours to External\nAffairs Officer Grenville Manuel\nand Welfare Officer Pete\nWilson. The Social Colours\nCommittee had originally not\nrec commended either for an\naward.\n10% Cut For IC\nA cut in Government funding of\n10% over the next five years is\nexpected by the Rector,\nequivalent to the loss of 50\nacademic staff unless\nalternative funding can be\nfound. This assumes that the\nCollege will do no better than\naverage in the present round of\ncuts now being planned by the\nUniversity Grants Committee\n(UGC).\nThe Rector, Professor Ash,\nmade this prediction whilst\naddressing the AGM of the\nAcademic Staff Assembly, the\nbody of academic staff at IC, on\nWednesday. About 120 lecturers\nheard the Rector speak and\nanswer questions for about 45\nminutes.\nThe Government has told the\nUGC to cut the universities by\n2% per annum for five years in\nreal terms. The UGC is\npresently assessing how to\ndistribute this cut amongst the\nuniversities, and it is expected\nto hit some institutions harder\nthan others. The two criteria\nbeing used are the quality of\nresearch and the staff/student\nratio at each institution, with the\nlatter having twice the\nweighting of the former. Whilst\nIC scores well on the first\ncriteria, research, it suffers from\nhaving a staff:student ratio of\nProf Ash: worried about cuts\nonly 1:8, compared with 1:10\naverage nationally. It seems\nlikely therefore that the College\ncannot expect to do better than\naverage according\" to the\nRector. The special treatment\nthe college received in the past\nwill not, he believes, continue.\nThe only consolation is that the\ndamage to IC is expected to be\n'contain able'. What this means in practice,\nsaid the Rector, is that the\nCollege must fund about 50\nlectureship s from industry if it is\nto avoid losing posts. The\nalternative would be to allow for\nnatural wastage to cut 10% off\nthe number of staff, which\nwould happen in an unplanned\nway, and result in a static,\nde moral is ed staff. He thought\nthat industry would find it more\nfinancially attractive to pay for a lecturer post than to employ\nsomeone directly, and that it\nwas possible for the necessary\nnumber of posts to be funded\nover t We five year period.\nEarlier in his speech the\nRector described recruitment of\nstudents as IC's biggest\nproblem. Whereas the College\nhad not had to worry in the past\nit was now under pressure\nbecause of the fall in the\nnumber of 18 year olds and\nincreasing competition from\nother universities. The College\nhas only recruited 900 home\nstudents this year against a target of 1000. The UGC would\npenal is e consistent shortfalls\nfinancially, he thought, making\nit essential to meet the target.\nDepartments should put more\neffort into attracting students,\nfor example by producing\nglossy brochures, he said.\nThe numbers of overseas\nstudents are now back to the\nlevel when full-cost fees\n(continued on back page)\nFree!\nFriday 16 May No 740\n\n"

The most important\nthing is to get the work done in time for the start of the new year.\nSector C non Union Services\n1 Haldane Library\nThe record librarian refused to put a record bought by the Union's buyer into the\ncollection as she considered that the title of the artist was offensive. This\nprecipitated along discussion at ISC about moral responsibility and the librarians\nright of veto on records purchased by the Union's buyer with the Unions money\nwhich are intended for predominantly student ears. At the time of writing this position\nhas not been resolved.\n2. Southside Bar\nThe new Food Bar has been a great success. It has not harmed the Union's food\ntrade and provides good quality food at reasonably prices (but you knew that didn't you). I hope that I speak for everyone when I express IC Unions appreciation of\nRoger Pownall'sac he ive ment.3 Refectories\nThe quality of the food on offer showed some improvement immediately after the\nnew Refectory manger took over but seems to have done little since. There is still a long way to go.\nSECTOR D THE COMMITTEE\nAt the start of the year the committee seemed to be suffering from a lack of direction\nand purpose. Although it obviously became very pre occ up pied with the bar issue, I feel that it now has the correct structure for the future; divorcing itself from the nitty\ngritty of management and setting itself up with the responsibility for the\ndevelopment, publication and interaction of Union Services.\nAlan Rose\nPG Affairs\nGareth Fish\nSince being ca joule d into this job by Carl and Chris in July I must say that I have\nenjoyed myself although at times I have felt disp on dent about the lack of\ninvolvement of PG s in anything other than work or section/laboratory social ising. Small amounts of within departmental social ising has been organised. The lot of the\nPG at IC is a strange one and varies from section to section, department to\ndepartment. Workload varies social life is different. I would like to thank Gareth\nEdward -Jones for his work at Silwood and to thank Chris Martin (Treasurer) and\nHelena Bramwell for their contributions this year.\n1 Council: I have attended all meetings this year and felt that I have some\ncontribution to make to the general well being of the students that I represent and\nalso adding to the discussions giving the benefit of my 4.5 years at College.\n2 Bored Of Studies: Although I have missed the last two meetings due to being\nelsewhere in the first instance and representing the College at cricket in the second,\nI feel that I have learned a great deal about who runs College and I have raised a couple of important points about things in general at College. The next important\nthing is to make sure that representatives attend the BOS on 25/6/86 as it is at the\nfinal BOS of the year that the College always puts through devious course changes\netc with the Union being unable to stop them.\n3 Graduate Studies These meetings tend to last for 2.5 hours and are sometimes\nrather tedious. Lots of things of importance to both MScs and PhDs come up and I have always got my oar in on any matter that affects Postgrads. Ted Brown and the\nother academics as well as Messers Mee and Wheatly are friendly and I always get\nmore than my fair share of bicci es.4 Bar Committee I am the Council representative on this and for the last 15 months I have been secretary. Unfortunately this committee does not meet as often as it\nought and subsequently things that need doing and decisions by the committee,\nexcept price decisions, take several months to implement. One of the problems with\nBC is that the refectory manager does not turn up so it almost impossible to get him\nto answer to any of his misdeeds. Hopefully my two recommendations of 9/12/85 will\ngo some way towards preventing the farce of the price increases of last\nOctober/November. If Council agrees then I would like to continue to represent the\nUnion on this committee as I feel I have plenty to offer the Union on the bar front.\n5 UGMs I have been to the start of all the UGMs and think that I have continued to\ncontribute useful things to all those UGMs I have stayed to the end of. The last one\nended on a very sour note with there almost being a fight between the left and the\nright over the Barclays motion. The problems here lies in the apathy of the ordinary\nstudent who fails to attend and the meetings only become a political football after\nthe sabbatical elections. The vast majority of students at IC don't care about World\nPolitics, Nicaragua, Barclays Bank, or if they do they are too apathetic to do anything\nabout it. Until IC UGMs contain material of relevance to ordinary students they won't bother coming.\n6 Internal Services Committee I have attended most of these (when notified) and\nhave hence contributed usefully to the running of the Union Bar (see Union Bar).\n7. Beer Festival This is an important Rag Event and should continue to be\nsponsored by the Union as the potential of raising \u00a31 k is there. All that is required is\nsomeone will a pasion for beer { good real ale) to step forward and run the festival\nnext year. There is some doubt about the siting of next year's Beer Festival on\naccount of the work in the JCR and MDH. It may well have to take place in the Union\nBuilding. As ever I will contribute as much as I can to the running of this event.\n8 Union Bar I was involved in the Boycott. I did attend/man the picket lines and\nactively discouraged others from using the bars. I was in v loved in the takeover of the\nbar at all stages and enjoyed the battle with college. Mr Northey ought to be\ncastigated for his employment of Mr McVee. It left the bar in poor state for the\nUnion's subsequent takeover. For the first two weeks before Kevin Buckley's employment I was quite happy to be the cellar man and enjoyed the work. Since then\nI have been watching the progress of the bar and am pleased with the progress.\n9 PG Group this has not been very successful due to the failure of the PG's to turn\nup to the plough man's lunch and the Valentine's party. On a college wide scale the\ngroup is doomed to failure but organised departmental^ could be and is more\nsuccessful depending on departments.\n10 PG women Sam Chittendan has been co-opted as the Women's PG rep and\nhopefully will not have had much to do as PG Womens Officer.\n11 PG Appeals for several weeks I was pre sued by an MSc student who failed his\ndegree, appeal led, was de emd to have failed again, and spent three months seeing\neverybody he could repeatedly so as to try and get his degree. The Civ Eng\ndepartment, the registry, Prof Sayers, and myself have gone out of our way to to\nhelp him and we hope in the end he will res it and get his degree.\n12 IC Cricket Club I have been Hon Sec of this club and have put a lot of time into\norganising things and hopefully we should (weather permitting), be rewarded with a good season.\n13 Summary On the whole I have enjoyed my time as PG AAO and if anyone of you\nPGs out there is thinking of doing the job please come and see me. Of the above all\nthat needs to be done is 1,2,3 and 9. Overall I have enjoyed my time, as ever, and\nwill still be here til September 1987.\nPub Board Chairman\nHugh Stiles\nTo take the publications in turn:\nFELIX; This year has seen a very bold move by the editor in totally revamping FELIX\nand attempting to drag it into the mid 1980's. Although not universally popular, the\nsuccesses (and failures) of the new look FELIX should give next year's editor a firm\nbase from which to work.\nAfter last year when the student staff level fell to an all-time low, the student effort on\nFELIX has increased substantially with an almost completely new set of staff having\nbeen trained up over the year. Many of these people will be around next year and so\na higher standard of production from early on may be expected.\nFinally of course, there is the FELIX move; arguments for and against it abound, and\nI believe that only time will tell whether the move is a good thing or not.\nIC Radio; Beset initially by internal divisions, the radio station has settled down into a smooth running ry t nem, with almost too many erstwhile presenters to be\naccomodate d. The refurbishment of the Southside studio has moved very much further on this\nyear with the new mixer desk fast approaching completion. Attention is now being\nturned towards making Northside into a viable studio. The idea of 'Community\nRadio' still skirts the fringes of the IC Radio consciousness but as yet nothing can be\ndone.\nSTOIC; This has run very smoothly indeed and, certainly from my position, appears\nto run with a calm professionalism that gets the job done and still leaves time to look\nto the future.\nThat future has started to take shape this year with the first steps on the way to\nmaking the studio in RATT a viable alternative to the College studio. Plans have\nbeen proposed for the necessary partitioning and soundproofing and an edit suite\nhas been obtained at a favourable price from the College TV studio.\nHandbook; Generally well received this year although subjected to perhaps unfair\ncriticism from certain parts of the Union for too great a use of editorial freedom.\nThe question of how to dist i bute to overseas fresher s is still an unresolved problem\nas the bags of unclaimed Handbooks in Quentin's office testify. Sorting this out\nbefore next October must be a priority for the new Hon. Sec.\nPhoenix; At one stage going through editors like they were going out of fashion, the\nPhoenix has ended up in the lap of Chris Edwards who, I am sure, will do a very\ncapable job.\nThis year the magazine is being printed 'in-house' and is now target ted for its main\nsales in October rather than the late part of the Summer term.\nIt is regrettable that the changes in editorship nothing something special could not\nhave been arranged for this, the 100th year of the Phoenix.\nAP; At the end of last year it was decided to extend the print run on the AP in order to\nsave money this year by not printing one.\nAs this year wore on, more and more diss at is fact on with that decision came to the\nsurface until attempts were made to find the funding for a new AP for this year.\nIt was suggested to College that they should fund the AP since it was essentially a part of the recruitment propaganda rather than a publication for consumption by\nUnion members.\nIn spite of the fact that an editor was elected to oversee the AP ( be it a full issue or\njust a supplement) over a very foreshortened timetable, College were unable to\ncome up with the money.\nIt is unfortunate that the very best efforts of the two keen people involved, should\nhave come to naught in this manner.\nPG Handbook; To my sorrow this did not appear. Not one postgraduate felt they\ncould edit it for the benefit of future and potential postgraduates.\nSometimes I wonder why the Union bothers doing anything for postgraduates.\nOn a more general level I have been very tied up in my research this year and to a certain extent I have been a 'caretaker' chairman rather than the 'new broom' I set\nout to be. However, to my surprise, with the exception of placing orders, I have found that Pub.\nBoard operates very well with just gentle guidance required from the top, and credit\nmust go to the constituent parts for the responsible attitudes they adopt.\n\u2022 Financially things are not looking too bad, this being the first year without carry over the guessed at 15% contingency could have been too low. However, it seems as if\nthe matter was judged just right.\nMy thanks to Steve, Pete, Judith and to all the members of Pub Board all of whose\nmaturity in discharging their responsibilities took a lot of potential pressure away\nfrom me when I could least have coped with any difficulties.\nThanks Pub Board-I wish all MSC's were like you.\nH.N. S. Rag Chairman\nJohn Ingham\nMonopoly and tiddlywinks at the start of the year both went very well and I recommend the same form again next year. The two collections in Rag Week and\nthe Leapfrogging last term were less successful. I have obtained a list of licences for\nthe whole of next year so at least we can now plan which licences to use in advance.\nRag Week\n\n"

Well, yes\nwould have been my\nanswer to this, having seen\nthe repetitive rubbish that\nis paraded as 'Rock' music\nthese days. But as Ronnie\nhas been in the business so\nlong and has provided me\nwith so many hours of\nlistening pleasure in his\nvarious guises as heavy\nrock's most experienced\nentrepreneur, I decided to\ngive DIO a second chance,\nhaving seen them in\nNewcastle two years ago.\nThe venue Hammy ode a on, the time-well I thought it\nwas 7.30 but in fact it\nseemed to be anytime in\n1520 once they had started\nKEEL. The support group,\nled a reasonable if\npretentious start to the\nevening. But it was DIO\nthat we were waiting for\nand what a start! Straight\ninto the King of Rock and\nRoll, beat y and bouncy and\nall you'd expect from a rock and roll band. But the\nstage set had to be seen to\nbe believed! A medieval\ncastle, one roaring dragon,\nan awful lot of p hot en debauch ern and we were\ninto the most amazing\nstage set I 've ever seen.\nWith the drums kit hoisted\nhigh into the castle turret,\nand the keyboards on the\nother side, the lighting\ncomplimented both in a hitherto un imagined display\nof space production. Dio\nhimself was powerful and\nseemingly unfettered by the\nnigh-on 50 years of his life\nwhilst the new guitarist,\nCraig Goldie, dazzled us by\neffortless fits of virtuosity.\nThe lighting developed into\nlasers during 'Don't Talk to\nStrangers', which itself led\ninto an immense display of\ndrumming talent.\nAccompanied by laser and\nstrobe effects, by Jinnie\nAppic, one of Rock's most\nexperienced and com pet ant drummers. Solid support\nwas offered throughout by\nbassist Jimmy Bain, whilst\nkeyboard player Claude\nSchnell seemed to make\ntinkling the ivories as\nsimple as falling asleep.\nWhich none of us were\ndoing! The Dragon\nbreathed fire, smoke and\nlasers from the eyes, and\nthe show went from\nstrength to strength Ronnie\neventually defeating the\ndragon with an amazing\nlaser work. Heaven and hell\noriginal by Black Sabbath,\nI and Long live rock and\n\\\\ Roll, the Man on the Silver\nmountain, originally by\nRainbow (both with Duo as\na member, of course, led\nthe show to a fitting end\nwith We rock which\neverybody seemed to be\ndoing. We rock? We did,\nand if Duo sticks around,\nwe will be for year to come!\nBack In The DHSS\nMost students will at some time claim some form\nof benefit from the DHSS. In most cases this will mean\nfilling out some seemingly endless form, waiting a lot\nand then eventually re cie ving a giro. To many people\nthe exact means by which the amount on the cheque is\narrived at will seem mysterious, occasionally it will seem\nwrong. It is possible you may find yourself told you are\nnot entitled to benefit at all. Now while there are carefully\ndefined and arbitrary methods by which benefits are\nassessed mistakes are sometimes made. In which case\nwhere do you stand ?\nUntil recently I was probably as much in the dark\nas anyone else, but last September I found myself\ndisqualified from claiming Supplementary benefit for four\nweeks between finishing a temporary job and returning\nto college. Puzzled by the decision I decided not to let\nthe matter rest and so wrote off to the address given for\nthe leaflet about appeal ling. It now seems that the results\nof this may be rel event to other people this summer.\nAlthough ultimately I still find myself with no\nmoney it was a useful experience to find how the appeal\nsystem works. The first and most important point to\nmake is that by appealing you have nothing to lose and\neverything to gain. The first stage is that a DHS S employed adjudicating officer re-considers the claim.\nThis will result in a letter within a few weeks either\nawarding you benefit or, more likely it seems, upholding\nthe original decision. With this comes a further set of\ninstructions about what to do if you still disagree.\nGenerally you will find all sorts of obscure paragraphs\nfrom benefit regulations quoted at you. Although these\nmay seem rather difficult to relate to your particular\ncircumstances they will probably be fairly standard\nclauses which have become well used to cover all sorts\nof cases. If you want to find out what the DHS S are\nreally trying to say it is best to take your case along to\nsomeone with experience of these matters. This doesn't have to cost anything, the Citizens Advice Bureau is one\npossibility. Better stiff, if you are in college, Student\nServices Welfare Adviser, Lesley Gillingham, is\navailable to help with problems of exactly this nature.\nThe second stage of appeal is a Tribunal and\nafter consultation I decided to go along and find out what\none is like despite the fact that my chances of success\nwere actually rather minimal given the facts of the case.\nA Social Security Tribunal is not like a law court, in fact I found the whole thing to be very informal. The tribunal\nitself is composed of three laymen who are entirely\nindependent from the DHS S, they have a clerk who\ntakes care of all the paperwork and who also met me\noutside beforehand and explained the pro ceding s. There was a single representative for the adjudicating\nofficer who basically read out the papers I had\npreviously been sent.\nTribunal hearings can be open to the public (you\nare asked whether you mind about this before the date\nof the hearing) but from my experience this is not really a mass spectator sport. More importantly you can take\nalong someone to advise you or speak for you. In some\ncases Lesley Gillingham is able to assist students at\ntribunals, however in my case the hearing was held in\nthe town where I had worked and was beyond the scope\nof this service. You are not obliged to attend a tribunal\nbut it can only pay you to do so. You will not be out of\npocket as you are paid travelling expenses and there is\nalso a( modest) meal allowance if you are obliged to be\naway from home for longer than a certain time. It is in fac\npossible to have a hearing transferred to a more\nconvenient place if you have moved to another address\nsince your claim, for instance back to college.\nWhen it came to my turn the chairman of the\ntribunal was quite chatty about the whole affair and even\nasked me what I planned to do when I left college at the\nend. It transpires that the way I became caught by the\nsystem is quite common and hence worth noting if you\nhave a job this summer. When you are paid monthly in\narrears the DHS S will in fact assess your salary as\ncovering a month after the date you are actually paid.\nHence I found that despite being out of pocket between\nstarting work and getting my first pay cheque I was not\nentitled to dole money for sometime after I officially\nstopped working. So this is a cautionary tale, but at the\nsame time it carries an urge to never give up because it\nis always possible that you might be lucky and find a tribunal who look sympathetically on you.\nFinally it is important to remember that the\nbenefit system is not some hideous conspiracy against\nyou but is staffed by perfectly average people just doing\na job, it is up to you to make sure it works in your favour\nand not against. My case provides just one example; I was not aware until told at the tribunal that it is possible\nto continue claiming supplementary benefit after starting\nwork for a period of up to 15 days or until you are first\npaid. This is equivalent to about \u00a3 5 0 and is an\nentitlement rarely pointed out.\n16 Friday 16 May FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Waitrose Again....\nDear Hugh\nPlease find enclosed a copy of a letter I have sent to the\nManager of the Waitrose supermarket in Gloucester Rd. In\nthe wake of the letter which appeared in the FELIX issue\nnumber 738\nDear Sir or Madam You will short ll y receive, or perhaps have already received,\na letter-petition signed by the staff and students of Imperial\nCollege requesting you to cease selling South African\nproduce. As a student at Imperial College and a regular\ncustomer of your supermarket, I would ask and advise you\nto ignore the aforementioned letter. It is written by a very\nsmall group of well-intention ed but extremely naive and\nmisguided people who claim to represent the eight\nthousand students and staff at Imperial College but in fact\nrepresent a totally insignificant proportion of them.\nIt must be very clear to you that by stocking South African\nproduce you are in fact helping the black population of\nSouth Africa by providing them with an export market. As a large amount of South Africa's black population is\nemployed in agriculture, this can only be to their\nadvantage. In addition, people in general and students in\nparticular tend to buy whatever food is cheapest, best\nvalue for money or has the best taste. If any of your South\nAfriican goods fall into one of these categories and you\ncease to stock them, then we shall be obliged to shop elsewhere. And let me assure you that we represent the\nvast majority of your customers.\nYours faithfully,\nAlastairJ Seymour\nCharity: Right Or Wrong\nDear Hugh, I was very glad to read your editorial on charity.Indeed, if\ncharity stops people from facing the real issues, nothing\ncould be worse. Therefore, two questions arise: First, is this\nwhat charity actually does? and second, is there a place for\nit here and now? Large charities such as Oxfam have gone a long way\ntowards becoming political pressure groups. Most charities\ninvolved in the Third World do now look at the root of the\nflag activities are 'attended because of the fun involved'\nproblems rather than try to cover them up or quiet en some middle class consciences. There has been a time when\ncharities, especially those supporting (or having their roots\nin) the Church treated suffering people as the favourite\npastime of their members. Even our Rag activities are\nmostly attended because of the fun involved rather than\nbecause of the cause they serve.\nHowever, many charities play a major role in the solution of\nproblems. The case of charities for disabled people which\ncontributed towards major achievements in terms of\nlegal is ation by forming nuclei around which groups were\nformed and say was given to the people involved is one example. V SO, which asks for much more than a few\npennies, is another. Every charity must have as its target\nthe final solution of the problems but this does not mean that it shouldn't treat them as best as possible in the\nmeanwhile.\nThere are issues, like world hunger, where charity as such\nis inadequate. This is not always the case. The RNLI is a charity supported organisation which deals effectively with\nits object. Charity doesn't HAVE to be ineffective, neither\nhas it got to turn people away from the real problems.\nFurthermore, there is a place in the world for them. Not\neverything can be dealt with directly by the state, and\nservices that can effectively rely directly on the public\nshould stay clear from the muddy waters of party interests.\nPeople often support or oppose a certain cause just\nbecause it is 'their' party's general policy. Charities can often unite people from different ideologies on big issues\nwhereas parties can divide them on the same issues.\nHence the value of charities as fairly objective press sure groups.\nFinally, let me point out that we should at tat cha great value\nto the human individual. Saving a single child from hunger\nor disease is not comparable to painting one square foot of\nthe wall of a hundred-foot-tall building whose facade is\nworn and blackened. It makes no difference to the building\nbut it makes a world of difference to the child. As long as charities do save lives, even a few, we have to keep them.\nTherefore let us give as much as possible: Not only our\npennies but also our time, our thought, our effort for those\nin need. (A very good opportunity comes this week,\nChristian Aid week. CA works on agricultural development,\nhealth education and, above all, to empower people to win\ntheir own fight against poverty and suffering.

    "content": "This committee consists of the College Senior Tutor, The Senior Tutor for\nWomen, Nightline Director, Students Councillor and representatives form the\nDay Nursery, Health Centre Students Services and the Union.\nIt does not appear to be able to do anything but allows many problems from\neach area to be aired so that a coordinated approach can be made to alleviate\nthe most serious problems and to enable a better approach to be made of\nproblems that reoccur.\nCentral Libraries Committee\nA lot of space in the College is taken up by libraries and it was initially\nthought that there was a great duplications of texts and expensive periodicals\nand so some libraries could be merged. Eventually it was decided that the\nlibraries could not be merged but only; special list texts should be placed in\nthe departmental libraries and multiple copies of undergraduate texts should\nbe kept centrally. The library space in each department from my experience\nare used a great deal by students to work in and it would be a mistake to lose\nthis space.\nRefectory Users Commitee.\nThis has effect iv ley replaced the suggestions and Complaints Committee,\nhaving absolutely no power at all. It allows the users (staff, students) to\nquestions the Refectory Manager on what is happening and to bring up\ncomplaints from the little used complaints boxes and can suggest a proposal\nfor courses of action but at least we do find out what is actually happening.\nCommittee on Overseas Students\nAthough my pre des s or had criticised the need to spend vast sums on\nrecruitment visits to South East Asia the committee is still sending people on\n'holiday' to gain just a few people. Criticisms again were made a revamped\nbooklet explaining why it was inadvisable for prospective students to bring\ntheir fa miles over here has been produced.\nIt was decided that a certain percentage of the money which overseas\nstudents pay to the College should be given over to their welfare as it seems\nonly reasonable that if we bring them over here we should look after them.\nUnfortunately this money was again mostly allocated to recruitment visits\nunder he auspices of the Pro Rector (External Development). Although they\nhave been pushing for overseas married accommodation there is little that this\ncommittee can do about anything\nStudent Residences Committtee\nThere have been many problems this year both with the Southside and Evelyn\nGardens Remedial work. There were many worries that the work would not be\ncompleted in time and that there was no consultation with the residents as to how\ntheir halls should be reworked. This was eventually sorted out. Several Working\nparties were formed to deal with aspects of Southside Security, Evelyn Gardens\nWardens appointment procedure, and the procedure for re-applicants which to\nmy mind came to satisfactory conclusions. Southside has gained two security\nbooths at both entrances, the House Wardnes have been upgraded in status so th t they are now equivalent to Hall Wardens, Evelyn Gardens remedial work over the\nsummer will be far better co-ordinated with the summer letting scheme.\nPeter Hallworth has done a great job in creating several new overseas married\nflats by converting disused basements in Princes Gardens, He has also\nsucceeded in making Southside look quite nice while still keeping in with the\nGLC fire regulations. He has had adff i cult job to do and has had many people\nhaving a go at him, but I think within the financial constraints that he has had\nto work with he has done admirably well.\nTelephones have been a major pro lb em in the residences this year with vast\namo uht s of money being lost, for reasons of security I cannot say why, which\nhas led to the installation of new blue phones. Evelyn Gardens will finaly be\ngetting internal phones connected to the college system, but how many has\nnot yet been decided. Remedial works have been carried out in Montpelier\nHall but the entry phone still is yet to be operational.\nThe rents for next year are still to be decided but the SRC reserve will be\npreserved in case new accommodation comes on the market\nWardens Sub Committee\nThis has been a busy year for this committee with problems about the\nremedial work in Evelyn Gardens, security in general, new Wardens procedure\nand various problems dealing with the nitty gritty of residences in particular\nas opposed to the general policy decided by SRC. It is very useful as only\neach Warden knows the ins and outs of the particular residences.\nSnack Bar\nThis has had another successful year for the Snack Bar, It seems the college\nhave taken the hint as they have changed their style completely to emulate us.\nIt only goes to show that giving people what they actually want is the only\nway to succeed. The problems encountered are getting enough staff for the\ncorrect hours. Part time staff are extremely difficult to find for the morning\nperiod. Student casuals are also very hard to find for the lunch time rush.\nFortunately we gained a resting student to become a full time staff member\nand this arran g ment has proven very satisfactory. The operation will become\nmore me chan is ed with the introduction of a food processor and hopefully in\nthe future the catering operation will be expanded. Many thanks to Norman,\nJulie, Peter and all the casuals for their hard work.\nUnion Bar\nHaving only taken over this operation on Jan 1st it is significant that we\nshould show a profit in the quiet terms of the year. There has been a lot of\nwork ot do just to satisfy the health inspectors but now that we are in control\nwe are able ot devote time and effort to see that everything is brought up to\nscratch and eventually refurbished to our specifications. I must thank\neverybody who helped in the infancy of this operation especially Moore Lyttle\nfor all his hard work to sort out the existing problems\nBookshop\nAfter making a loss the previous year the Bookshop was back to its feet again\nand returned \u00a35k to the Unions. This year it is set to make an even greater\nprofit. The bookshop should be fully computerised by the end of session\nwhich will help the stock control and auditing process. Much thanks must go\nto Roy Hicks and Jason Gold for the work that they have put in\nSportshop\nFor the first time the sports shop looks like making a profit. This is mainly due\nto finally getting rid of the dead stock and cutting staff costs by reducing the\nhours of opening. I think that it is a valuable service and we should not think\nof closing it\nSTA Travel Office\nThis has continued to provide a good service (not only to Dave and Myself)\nbut due to the JCR/SDH changeover it wilt have to move although not until\nthe summer 1987\nItems and Events\nComputer\nAlthough my pre des s or reported last year that the computer would be\ninstalled at the start of this session he was unable to do this. Many problems\ndeveloped with the person who had been contracted to report on the subject\ntherefore it was left to me to pick up the pieces. After much consultation with\nvarious experts I finally decided on a workable system to deal with the Union\naccounts and word processing but at the time of writing having all the software\nand printers, I am suffering form the v agua ries of IBM who have not delivered\nthe goods. Hopefully, if IBM get their collective arse s into gear the system\nshould be installed by the summer.\nHarlington Gravel Extraction\nThis had been an ongoing situation since 1978 when a PhD student\ndiscovered that there was gravel underneath the playing fields. Much\nargument and debate went on as to how the money should be spent and how\nthe extraction would affect the sports teams. For the last two years plans had\nbeen drawn up on how many pitches were needed and how they could be\nfitted around the extraction works. The area that would be dug up would be\nrefilled and resurfaced so that it would be playable upon in 3 years time. This\nwas worked out by experts in soil mechanics and restoration. Unfortunately\nnobody had considered the quality of the pitches necessary for certain types\nof sports such as hockey and cricket therefore a big hoo-ha developed which\nled Mick Reynolds to redesign the entire area to accommodate the needs of\nthese various clubs. The planning permission has finally been obtained and a tender from Streeters, who own the land next door has been verified.\nThe Governing Body has agreed that the money obtained form the\nextractions should not disappear into the general College coffers but go\ntowards a capt i al project such as a new Sports Hall at South Kensington. This\nwill be necessary when the Old Chemistry building is knocked down and we\nlose the volleyball court.\nBar Takeover\nIt has always seemed very strange to me that a student Union should not\ncontrol its own building. Most modern Student Unions run all their facilities\nemploy hundreds of staff and do it very well. It was my considered opinion,\nseeing that we had turned a loss making refectory into a profit making snack\nbar that we could run our services in a better way than they were when the\nmanagement showed little interest. To this end a boycott of the bars was\norganised, a concept that was previously thought conceptually difficult if not\nimpossible. Suffice it to say it worked and we are now in control. The turmoil\nand strife that occurred up to the time of our takeover has now thankfully\nbeen eradicated from memory and we now again have peace in our time.\nNext year with the refurbishment of the Lounge Bar we shall be able to\nproduce a proper social centre within the Union Building and perhaps make\nthe Union more relevant to its members.\nRag Mag\nOnce again the Rag Mag has caused controversy. There have been several\narticles in the national press as well as the Bradford Argus. Understandably\nseveral people in Bradford were upset about the inclusion of certain Bradford\nCity fire jokes. Having tried to have them removed it was quite unfortunate to\nbe censured at the first meeting of the year but thats life. Nevertheless they\nseemed to have sold quite well but I hope that next years Rag Committee will\nact in a more sensible way now that a censor hip committee has been set up.\nWomens Officer\nThis year saw the introduction of the first IC Womens Officer. This was not\njust to replace the ICWA President who had a completely different function.\nThe Womens Officer is supposed to identify certain problems pertaining to\nwomen such as sexual harassment, sexist publicity, the attitude of many men\nincluding lecturers to women and other areas of which I had no knowledge\nbut a woman would directly experience. The election had necessarily to have\nonly women involved in the voting procedure to avoid the election being taken\nover by unthinking jokers. I felt that it was time for a Womens Officer since\nnow we are actively campaigning to get more women at this College\nNew Disciplinary Procedure\nThe situation had arisen that the present College disciplinary regulations\ndrawn up 17 years ago were unsatisfactory. The process of implementation\nwas unnecessarily cumbersome and hence so unwieldy as to-be unusable.\nUnfortunately there were many occasions that merited the implementation of\nthis process and so a new policy was drawn up after many months of\nconsultation, amendment and a lot of wrangling. It is a shame that this\nprocedure is necessary as so much u necessary violence and vandalism has\noccured this year. I can only hope that people syphon off their energy in more\nconstructive pursuits next year.\nINCOST\nHaving written at length about this elsewhere I shall not attempt to paraphrase\nthis at all but instead shall strongly recommend that ICU continues to send\ndelegate to it. It serves as a useful forum for the exchange of views between\nstudents of different nationalities. Many English people tend to neglect the\nimportance of other count i res as to what we do here, especially as a lot of IC\ngraduates eventually go to work abo rad.A specialist conference for\ntechnology students is a very useful forum, since co-operation n between\nnations in industrial, economic and technological development is becoming\nincreasingly common.\nFELIX, Bot Zoo and Union Buidling\nThe Botany Zoology Common Room has been a target for the expansion of\nthe biology department for a great many years. Since then the Biology\nDepartment have gotten more ambitious with the advent of several lucrative\nre a search projects for which they need extra space. The Rector decided that it\nwas a good idea to central is e the Biology department in S Ken, Ashurst lodge\nat Silwood being sold to raise funds, and so the Bot-Zoo Common Room and\ninitially the Lounge party room were to be used as extra lecture space for\nwhen the Biology Lecture theatres were converted into laboratories and\noffices. However there was a mighty uproar that we could not possibly lose\nthe lounge as it was the only party room in the Union that did not disturb the\nneighbours who always sent the police in to break up the 'riots' that were\noccur ing the Union Building.\nSubsequently the Rector and the College Secretary had a quiet stroll\naround the Union Building and took note of the large amount of disused\nspace in the building and appalling state that it was left it, especially the 'Ents\nOffice'. They then decided that this was an unacceptable situation and\nsomething had to be done about it. Hence the plan to move the FELIX office\nfrom its present location to the disused kitchen area behind the lounge. As an\nincentive for the move \u00a325,000 was been offered to re-equip the FELIX office.\nThe effect of all these upheavals is to central is e all the Unions activities in the\none building and hence prevent further takeover bids by the expansion\norientated Biology Department, with whom we have had the highly\nunsatisfactory arrangement of sharing the Beit Quad with. Suffice it to say we\n\n"

    "content": "Nevertheless trie societies have continued to be active and provide a valuable outlet for the political, religious and miscellaneous societies and their\nrole in broadening the life in this college.\nos c As more overseas students arrive new societies need to be set up to cater for\nthem. Alexis Papaspiridis has ably coped with this and has also managed to\nget their spending more under control.\nAlexis has ably represented the overseas students on the College\nCommittees he has attended especially in the areas of accommodation,\nwelfare, and recruitment practices.\nPub Board\nFELIX, the supposed newspaper of Imperial College Union has been a great\ndisappointment to me. I was under the misapprehension that Hugh Southey\nhaving held several Union posts would be the ideal position to publicise the\nUnion. Unfortunatley he chose to ignore his duty to the Unin which employs\nhim and decided to go on a campaign to remove a sabbatical. It seems\nincredible to me that he can continually fail to seek the truth but will rely on\nrumour and hearsay. The newspaper of Imperial College Union should be the\nvoice of the students and not just the voice of the editor. I have received many\ncomplaints from clubs and societies that their articles have not been put in.\nEven the sabbatical notices have been relegated to the editorial as footnotes.\nThe space is filled with esoteric and incomprehensible articles and reviews\nwhich are seldom read. Although FELIX is the best produced publication in\nthe University system I feel that more input from the student body is\nnecessary.\nAs for the other written publications the Handbook came under fire\nespecially for the cover which was meant to create an immediate bad\nimpression of the Union in general and myself in particular. Is it any wonder\nthat people do not get involved in the Union when their first impression are\nthat it is run by a bunch of incompetent idiots who by the vagaries of the\ndemocratic process elected to represent them.\nThere was no Alternative Prospectus this year as it was decided last year to\nproduce one biannually. This decision was taken because as there is little or\nno change in the departments each year, the money could be spent on far\nmore deserving causes. Unfortunatley J Martin Taylor and Sunny Bains took it\nupon themselves to campaign for the reinstatement of the AP knowing full\nwell that no money had been allocated for it. Ms Bains not to be outdone then\nwent for an AP supplement, how else could she possible gain the editorial\nexperience for her campaign to be the first female FELIX editor. However this\nhas not come to pass and so we'll just have to wait until next year.\nHaving not seen the Phoenix I cannot comment upon its artistic merit, but\nhaving seen the vast quantities of previous issues lying about cluttering up\nvarious offices I am forced to ask myself 'Is it really worth it?'\nIn co tra st to FELIX, IC Radio and Stoic have actually personally come to\nsee me and ask for my comments on a regular basis. They still continue to\nproduce very good quality programmes but they felt that the increased\nmembership fee decreased their levels of membership.\nPost Graduate Affairs\nGareth Fish has done very well in organising events for the sizeable postgraduate contingent in this college. This work ws started last yee r and has\nbeen built up admirably this year with a very good turn out at all their\nfunctions.\nUnfortunately nobody volunteered to produce the post-graduate handbook\nwhich ws a great success last year, I can only hope somebody produces one\nnext year.\nExternal Affairs\nThis year we have decided to adopt a far more sensible and realistic attitude\nto the University of London General Union Council and our input man ged to\nquiet en down the more radical loony left element which tends to frequent\nsuch bodies. I feel we made a valuable contribution to the debates and to the\nresponse to the green paper, which would have made us out to be absolutely\ncretins if they had set it out in its original form.\nWe have also been involved with the AUT strike, passing a motion to\nsupport the pickets and boycott the lectures. This solidarity against the\ngovernments educational policy showed the depth of feeling of both staff and\nstudents on this matter.\nThe leaflet campaign outside Harrods was fairly successful but there were\ncomplaints that it was not publicised sufficiently and so many people who\nwould have gone did not know about it. This is something to consider for the\nfuture if we are to continue our role as an effective campaigning body.\nNext year will see the emergence of the great NUS debate. We are a thorn\nin the side of the NUS at present because they cannot claim that they\nrepresent the total student body. It is a shame that they base their leadership\nupon party political lines and hence refuse to hear a significant minority of\nstudents that disagree with them. Hence the National Executive is completely\nmade up of NOLS people with no representation for anybody else and hence\nno desire to change their structure or policies. I think it is necessary to send\nvisitors to the conference to observe the events and see what it is really like.\nUnfortunately nobody went this year and so cannot report on if the\nproceedings have improved since I last went.\nENTS\nEnts have been very difficult this year with a complete lack of communication\nbetween their officers. The state of the Ents 'Office' was so appalling that the\nCollege Secretary and the Rector decided that those areas should be put to\nbetter use. Unless Ents get their collective acts together there will be more\nproblems next year.\nAcadmic Affairs\nThe major thing to happen this year was the setting up of an Undergraduate\nStudies Committee by the College which had originally only had the three\nC CU AAOs on it but included me when I expressed an interest. It seemed\nreasonable to have somebody who had just finished their undergraduate life\nand hence had a complete view of what was wrong with the teaching methods\nin all 3 or 4 years. Unfortunately we found out very early that there were a lot\nof things we didn't know concerning workloads, contact hours or whether\nstudents were satisfied with their courses there fore we drew up several\nquestion aires and obtained answers from each departments students and\nstaff. Each head of department was also interviewed once all this information\nhad been collated we were then able to draw conclusions and make\nrec commendations which will be going to the board of studies in the Summer.\nIt is very important that we do not lose momentum on these issues and so I hope the AAOs plus whoever takes over from me (it can be any sabbatical\nofficer) keep on hammering on the doors of bureaucracy. I would like to thank\nLuke Walker for all the work he has put in this year and wish that all AAOs\nwere as keen.\nThe Academic Affairs Committee organised its very first Training day for Ac\nReps. JMT finally had a good idea here. It worked very well and I would hope\nthat this can continue but much earlier in the year than this one was.\nIt seems that nobody knows what the Union is doing when it comes to the\nfield of academic affairs. Although staff-student committees are fine for\ndealing with immediate problems which crop up now and again in\ndepartments, the Union represents the students on the Board of Studies which\nformulates the educational policy of the college. All Dep Reps should attend\nthe Academic Affairs Committee in order to formulate the Unions view as to\nwhat this pol cy should be.\nThere was no alternative Prospectus this year, neither is there a supplement.\nThis was decided last year, in an attempt to save money. The question is\nwhether we should pay for it at all as it takes money from the current students\nto attract potential students? I suppose though it could be used as a weapon\nto cause the college to change, after all Victor Mooney retired after a really\nvicious attack in the AP about the state of the refectories.\nHouse Committee\nIt never ceases to amaze me how furniture moves all over the building or just\ndisappears never to be seen again. People just don't seem to understand that\nif we place tables and chairs in a room that is where they are supposed to be,\nif they are borrowed they should be returned. Anyway the building hasn't fallen down yet and the re decoration program is still under way. STOIC are\nhaving a studio built on the top floor, the lounge bar is going to be\nrefurbished during the summer and the IC Union Office is being transferred to\nthe tea room next to John Smiths office.\nCollege Committee\nGoverning Body, Finance and Executive\nThese are the two top college committees, each meeting once per term with three\nstudent observers. I felt that it was very important that we were able to contribute\ndirect knowledge of student problems to the Governors, and the Chairman took\nevery opportunity to ask our opinions on matters directly concerning students for\nexample the Harlington Gravel Extraction, the accommodation problems,\ndiscipline in the college etc. It is very important to keep on the ball as many issues\nhave been sidestepped for years but have now been finally resolved. They are also\nvery important for disseminating information since much much of the College\nInternal Business is discussed.\nCollege's House Committee\nThis committee controls all aspects of Residence, Refectories (including\nBars), Estates (now called Maintenance Services) and Conference. This year it\nhas formulated policy on the aims of its sections so that effective monitoring\nof the success or failure can be done. It can often by very useful way to\nbypass the lower-level committees who can not or will not respond to\ncontinued complaints and criticism.\nCatering and Conference Services Management Committee\nThis is a new committee set up at the investigation of Lord Flowers, the\nprevious Rector. It is chaired by the College Secretary. Its aims were to unify\nthe Refectory system with the conference office who in the past had to work\ntogether but had only done so with considerable friction.\nThere was much criticism of this as its resulted in the disbanding of the\nRefectory Committee and a shift of control from the users of the system, ie\nthe Academics, students and staff to the administrators who are there to run\nthese facilities for our benefit. This situation has led to the administrators\nbeing answerable to themselves which many Acadmics find un accept ib le.I think it will change in the foreseeable future.\nBoard of Studies\nThis is the top Academic Board of the College and is chaired by the Rector. It\ndeals with the academic policy of the College including creating professors,\nchanging courses structures and generally creates reams of statistics on\npass/failure/drop out/ application and varius other rates they can think of.\nThere was a serious drop in the number of applicants to the College this year\nwhich con cide d with a general drop in Science and Technology throughout\nthe country. This led to great worry about teaching standards and all\nassociated phenomena and the setting up of the Undergraduate Studies\nCommittee. The Data Protection Act caused a lot of concern becuase of\nexamination results are all on computers files. This led them to decide that\nthey would only release them if them to decide that they would only release\nthem if they were individually asked for as they bele ive that most students\nbelieve that the grades they are given are correct and so won't bother asking.\nIt seems to me that a few academics are completly out of touch with reality.\nGraduate Studies\nThis year as last year there was much discussion on the nature of a PhD.\nThere doesn't seem to be a concensus at all of what a PhD should consist of.\nNevertheless they came to a conclusion that most PhD theses are completely\nincomprehensible to even the most intelligent layman and hence decided that\neach PhD student should write a Scientic American type of report for\nsubmission as part of the degree. It is surprising that even though they are\nworried about PhD sub ms sion rates (a significant percentage submit after\n4,5,even 8 years) they still give the student more work to do\nUndergraduate Studies Committee\nThis committee was set up to replace the Education Technology Committee\nwhich was felt to be just a talking shop that achieved nothing at all.\nA great deal of work has been done by all the members of the committee\nand I must highly commend their efforts. We have had a very short time scale\nto work in since our conception but the recommendations that we have\narrived at will have far reaching effects if it is accepted by the Board of\nStudies-These recommendations include continual re-examination of\ncurriculum; limitation of student workload, the introduction of formal\ninstruction in learning skills; September res its; course unit systems; teacher\ntraining and assessment and various esoteric practises connected with these.\nI sincerely hope th t the Board seriously considers the document that we\nhave drawn up and implements all the recommendations that we have made.\nAthletics Committee\nThis committee overseas the running of Boathouse, Harlington and the South\nKensington Sports Centre.\nIt is surprising that even though we have many representatives on this\ncommittee hardly any of them turn up. Itis unsurprising that the Chairman was\nannoyed when he had flown over from the continent just to attend the\nmeeting.\nAthletic Ground Committee\nThis committee looks after Harlington our sports ground near Heathrow. The\nmajor business this year was the upkeep of the playing pitches while the\nextraction was occur in g.I shall write a full version of the Harlington Gravel\nExtraction later in this report\nWelfare Committee\n\n"
