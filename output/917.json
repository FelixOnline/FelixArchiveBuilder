    "content": "Feature Felix 917 15 November1991 Sponsorship Hypnosis Lecture\nTuesday will definitely be\nmomentous. In past years, for no\napparent reason, the Union staff\nhave never been actively encouraged to participate in Rag\nWeek. Bit of a shame really, seeing\nas how they're just as crazy as the\nrest of us. Anyway, for the whole\nof Tuesday, Cathy and Michelle,\nwho work behind the main desk in\nthe Union office, will be dressed as\nTweed leD um and Tweedle-Dee\nfor the whole day. This promises to\nbe a great spectacle so go up and\nsee 'em,and while you're up there\nchuck some money in their Rag\ncan. They're being sponsored to do\nit, so if you see them before\nTuesday put your name on their\nform.\nNext Friday is the City of London\nsponsored pub crawl, with people\nbeing sponsored per pint in each\npub. If you want to join in, or just\ncome along on the day, come to\ntoday's Rag meeting to find out the\ndetails.\nNext Saturday, as you are no\ndoubt aware by now, is the\nin famous Sponsored Nude Kamikaze Parachute Jump. If\nyou're around on the day go out and\ncheer. There' s nothing more embarrassing than having a hundred\nor so people cheering as you run (or\nwalk) naked from Harrods on a Saturday morning.\nYou will be there!\nOn Thursday of Rag Week at\n8.30pm, the Hypnosis Lecture will\ntake place in the Great Hall. If\nyou've ever seen Martin S. Taylor,\nhypnotist and magician, then I expect you'll be back to see him\nagain. If you haven't, then by all\nmeans go!\nThe first half of the evening is the\n'lecture'. Martin S. Taylor explains\nthe history and practice of hypnosis,\nand throws a few jokes in for no\nextra charge. This is possibly the\nonly interesting lecture ever to\noccur within any university but the\nreal fun starts in the second half of\nthe evening.\nSome people regard hypnosis in\nthe same light as astrology,\ndemonology and corn circles. It's not. It is a genuine feature of the\nhuman mind that it may be\nhypnotised, and hypnosis is used as\na modern medical tool. I have seen\nsomeone I know plunge a surgical\nneedle into the back of their hand\nwhile under hypnosis and they did\nnot feel any pain. Trust me, it's for\nreal.\nIt's also great fun to watch.\nMartin S. Taylor will be doing a lot\nServices\nof great hypnosis tricks and he will\nattempt to hy p not is e anybody who\nwishes to be hypnotised. But don't be afraid of coming along, as he\nwon't do anything to you too evil\nwithout your permission. If you\nwant to see this, or be part of it,\nthen come along.\nBut the best bit of any hypnosis\nshow is watching people you know\ndo very, very silly things. Like forgetting their own name. Or forgetting that the number 7 exists\n('count to ten' 'one two three four\nfive six eight nine ten' 'how many\ndwarves were there?' 'eight' 'name\nthem' \u2014 and he did!). Watching\nRAG WEEK TIMETABLE\nFriday 15 Guilds Carnival Union Building\nSaturday 16 RAG Raid Somewhere Far\nSunday 17 Giant Conga Prince's Gdns\nMonday 18 Mines Dirty Disco Union Building\nTuesday 19 Slave Auction\nCharity Auction\n& Barnight\nMech Eng 220\nUnion Building\nWednesday 20 RCS Beer Festival JCR (Sherfield)\nThursday 21 Hypnosis The Great Hall\nFriday 22 The Smoking Concert\nCabaret\nUnion Building\nSaturday 23 The Sponsored Nude Harrods to\nKamikazi Parachute Jump Union Building\nNo not the religious type, or the\nmechanical type, but the type that\nyou get done to other people during\nRag Week( all at a small cost, for\ncharity of course). Services include\nthe following:\nG no ming, Grim reaping, Handcuff ogram s and Pinta grams. These are obtainable via the\nRCS office (ext 8675) and are a fiver each.\nHit Squad (fl anning) will be\navailable from the Guilds' office\n(ext 8673) at \u00a31.50 for students and\n\u00a35 for lecturers and notables.\nIf you're not sure exactly what\nthese services entail, give the\nrelevant office a ring and they'll be\nonly too happy to tell you.\nBulk discounts are likely to be\navailable with a little haggling.\nHall Reps & Conga\nIf you're in hall and wish to know\nwhat's happening then the easiest\nway is by contacting your Rag Hall\nRepresentative. These are as\nfollows:\nBernard Sunley - Matthieu Pinel\n(ext 325) Michael Chamberlain (ext\n303); Falmouth Keogh - Andrew\nMcCall( ext 728); Fisher - Beccy\nLand (ext 406); Garden - Tamsin\nBraisher (ext 828); Linstead - Mark Bunyan (ext 773); Selkirk - Demi Jones (ext 748); Southwell - Sarah\nHortop; Ti zard Lorrie Butler (ext\n751); Weeks - Sandip Mehta; Willis\nJackson - Stuart Rison (ext 260).\nAlso contact them about any\nstupidities that you may wish to try\nin name of charity (that goes for\nduring the rest of the year as well).\nDon't forget to come and join the\nrest of the halls this Sunday\nafternoon at 3.00pm in Princes\nGardens for the biggest Conga that\nwe can manage. It should be a good\nlaugh and no-one does anything on\na Sunday afternoon anyway. We may also try another couple of\nsillies like a Caterpillar race (if you\ndon't know what this involves don't worry, very few people do) which\nshould also prove to be great fun.\n\u201410\u2014\n15 November1991 Felix 917 Feature\nRag Goodies are Here\nAndrew Wensley blunder across the\nstage in what he thought was a thick\nfog, bump into a wall that wasn't there and then search for the\ninvisible door was one of the most\nfunny things I have ever seen.\nDo come along. Tickets will cost\n\u00a33.50 at the door. Do get up if you\nwant to be hypnotised. Oh yes,\nthere's one big advantage in being\none of the final few on stage Martin S. Taylor usually leaves his\n'volunteers' with a suggestion that\nwater will taste like their favourite\nalcoholic drink, and will get them\ndrunk. Until midnight at least, when\nit all wears off with no hangover!\nThis year's Rag Mag has arrived\nbut will not be on sale until the Beer\nFestival on Wednesday. There will,\nhowever, be a few on sale in the bar\nevery night beforehand for at least\n\u00a32 (usual price 50p). And at last we have the Rag\nWeek T shirts. They are on sale\nnow for \u00a36 (which is cheap\ncompared to the \u00a310 you might pay\nnormally). They are available from\nRag Officers, Hall Reps and from\nthe Union Office.\nMascotry\nIMPORTANT The official fresh\nstart to Mascotry is happening today\nwith the handing back of Spanner\nand Bolt to City and Guilds. This\nis happening at l pm today on the\nQueen's Law n.C&G Slave Auction\nWhen: Tuesday 19th Nov Where: Me chEng220 Time:12.30 pm onwards\nOn Tuesday lunchtime it's the City\n& Guilds' annual slave auction. If\nyou haven't signed up yet and you\nwant to, do it quick. Slave auctions\nare always a good laugh (especially\nif you're participating). The general\nidea is that people are sold as slaves\n(all money going to Rag of course)\nto people or groups that then have\nthe services of that person for a day.\nDon't Panic. There are rules as\nto what a slave can and cannot do.\nHowever the best rule as far as\nslaves are concerned is that they\nmust be fed and watered for the\nday, good huh!\nIf you don't fancy being a slave,\nthen go along and buy one. They're\nalways good for tidying the odd\nroom, or two and taking lecture\nnotes. If you think that you may not\nbe able to afford a slave on your\nown, then form a consortium.\nLoads of people do every year and\nmore money goes to charity that\nway.\nBabble Cards\nIncluded in this Rag Week Pull-Out\nsection is a Babble Card for you to\ncut out and use.\nFor those of you who have not yet\ncome across these before, a Babble\nCard is given to someone who talks\nunnecessarily for a great length of\ntime on a topic of no interest or\nrelevance to anything in particular.\nSo, if you happen to be on the\nreceiving end of such mindless\nwaffle, then whip out your Babble\nCard, thrust it in their direction and\nhopefully they'll get the message.\nIf you happen to receive a Babble\nCard, then you are free to pass it\non to someone else who begins to\nbabble. By putting your name or\ninitials on the back of the card\nbefore passing it on, you can see\nhow many people have been given\nthe card before you, or how long\nit has taken for your own card to\nreturn to you.\nPlease make use of the Babble\nCard and help to eliminate senseless\ndrivel at IC.\nYES, IT'S THE PIT'S IT'S BULL..IT'S.. TOTAL ROTT\nTHIS IS VERY\nOFFENSIVE.\nKiller Extended\nOfficially the deadline for signing\nup for Killer was Wednesday.\nAlthough we have had a great\nresponse so far, it has been brought\nto my attention that there are still\na large number wishing to\nparticipate who have, as yet, been\nunable to sign up. As Killer only\ncomes round once a year it was felt\nthat it would be unfair not to give\nas many keen and eager assassins\nas we could the chance of their first\nkill. If YOU fall into this category,\nhaving not yet signed up, you will\nbe pleased to hear that we have\nextended the deadline to THIS FRIDAY. Today is your LAST chance. Sign up after the RAG meeting or at the Union office\nduring the day (it shuts 5.30). It's only \u00a32.50 & two photo's of yourself.\nFor those of you who have\nalready signed up, the official\nstarting time will now be 24.00 on\nMonday night. You will be\ninformed or where to collect your\ntarget from. We apologise for the\ndelay if your fingers are already\nitchy, but the more people involved\nthe more frantic it gets. Ha ha ha.\nYOU ARE ENTERING THE BABBLE ZONE\nBABBLE CARD\nYOU ARE A WITLESS CABBAGE.\nCEASE YOUR WITTERING\n\u201411 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 917 1\n5 November1991 Two thousand meals thrown away\nDear Adam,\nThank you for featuring the\nreport on Linstead Hall meals, in\nissue 915. I am writing on behalf\nof the residents of Linstead Hall, in\norder to explain the situation more\nfully.\nAlthough Linstead Hall provides\nfive evening meals a week, it has\nalways been possible for residents\nto sign out, and receive a rebate for\nup to two meals a week. However,\nduring the summer vacation it was\ndecided that the rebate system\nwould be scrapped, and residents\nwould be charged for five evening\nDear Adam,\nIn your reply to Professor\nSwanson's letter about the College\nDay, you asked whether the Trade\nUnions had been consulted.\nYou may be interested to know\nthat we were asked for our\ncomments by the Personnel Office\nat the end of May, and given a month in which to reply.\nDuring this period we sent a questionnaire to all our members,\nwho include administrative, library\nand computing staff as well as\nlecturers, asking for their views on\nthe likely effects of extended\nworking hours on their travelling,\nchildcare, research and other\nactivities.\nAs very little enthusiasm for the\nTuppence\nDear Adam,\nI feel I must write to you on the\nvery strongest terms.\nIt truly is a downright disgrace,\nwhy, oh why, can't people mind\ntheir own business.\nIt is hard to be a 'real' christian\nat IC. T.H. Huxley didn't believe\nin god yet they named the maths\nbuilding after him, while Jesus,\nwho did, was nailed to a tree. When\nwill we hear the whole story?\nIn this day and age surely we can\nexpect higher standards of oral\nhygiene. What do they teach school\nchildren these days?\nI say we must return to the old\nvalues. No more lax morals, easy\nmoney and fast girls. I can still\nmeals each week, regardless of whether they ate them or not. This\ndecision was taken when there were\nno students around to raise their\nobjections.\nIt is impossible for all residents\nto attend meals at 6 pm each\nweekday evening. Residents involved with many societies and\nclubs, working late in college,\ngoing home, not liking the meal on\noffer, or simply going out, either\ncannot be at all meals, or do not\nneed one.\nUnfortunately this new policy has\nproposed changes was expressed,\nwe were not unduly surprised that\nthe results of the questionnaire and\nthe specific comments made were\nnot passed on to the working party\nfor their consideration. Why should\nthey be, when the discussion by the\nBoard of Studies on23 rd October\nhad already been pre-emp ted by the\nstatement in the 'College Plan\n1991-92 to 1994-95' published\nduring the summer, which clearly\nstates ' The util is ation of accommodation will be increased\nduring the 1992-93 session by\nteaching outside of currently\ntimetabled hours...'\nYours sincerely,\nLaura Barker, Secretary,\nICAUT.\nha'penny\nremember the days when bread cost\nt up pence ha' penny. That's called\ninflation. Of course all this can be\nblamed on the abysmal level of student grants.\nHowever, IC what you are\ngetting at with your 'pussy' fetish.\nI would like to commend you on\nyour coverage of the recent spate of\ndog bugger ing attacks.\nPoetic justice has little to do with\nrhyming couplets or the judicial\nsystem in Marxist Britain.\nSo, why does Tony Tiger wear\npanty liners with security tabs?\nM. Schaeffer, Maths (2)\nP.S. Also to the person who\nthrew up in the foyer last Friday:\nWELL DONE!! stopped many residents from\njoining any clubs and societies\nwhich require them to miss their\nevening meals. With a rent bill this\nterm of \u00a3874.95 (single room), they\nfeel that they cannot afford to do\nthis. It is wrong to discourage\nresidents\u2014the majority of whom\nare first years, from involving\nthemselves with the sports, hobbies\nand social ising that is as much a part\nof university life as the academic\nwork.\nThese problems cannot simply be\nresolved by changing the time of the\nmeals, as has been suggested.\nApart from our objections to this\nnew system for financial and social\nreasons, there is also a moral issue.\nThe Catering Department now\nprepare about 188 meals each\nevening, regardless of whether they\nare to be eaten or not. A survey of159 residents revealed that during\nthe week, Monday7 Friday 11\nOctober 1991, at least 2 5 % of the\nfood prepared for these residents\nwas thrown away. We find this\nlevel of wastage unacceptable.\nAttempts have been made to\nintroduce a packed tea option. This\nwas originally only available on\nWednesdays and Fridays, but is\nnow available throughout the week.\nLinstead residents pay \u00a32.95 per\nmeal, and yet I calculated the value\nof the packed tea to be less than \u00a32.\nResidents are now telling me that\nthe value has been reduced further\nstill.\nThe whole situation is totally\nunsatisfactory. We want the old\nsigning-out and rebate system to be\nre-introduced immediately.\nI have been in contact with\nCollege Administration, but so far\nhave got absolutely nowhere. I am\nhoping that we can reach some\nsolution before next term\u2014by\nwhich time at least 2,000 meals will\nhave been thrown away.\nYours sincerely,\nElizabeth J Holmes,\nHall Convenor.\nSunday 1 December 91\n2.30 - 5.30pm mi\nGames & Toys *\nFather Christmas *\nFun and Feasting *\nGluhwein for grown-ups *\nMagic shows *\nPresent Making *\nDo come!

A sabbatical's main job is to represent students'\nviews but we can't do that without\nknowing the Union's stance and it\ncan't have one unless you, the\nstudents, make your views felt.\nCurrently we have to trust our own\njudgement on issues but who knows\nif that is the correct one? We believe\nit is but do you? For example, this\nU GM we were meant to be\ndiscussing the lengthening of the\nCollege Day but we couldn't. The Union could currently be bargaining\nfor the wrong thing where it comes\nto this issue but we don't know.\nDue to low numbers the U GM was closed early, there's going to\nbe an Extraordinary General Meeting ( EG M) in two weeks time\nwhich will be publicised. I hope\nmore people turn up as it is for\nyou\u2014every single IC student that\nwe're doing it.\nWomen's Weight Training Does anyone have any views on the\ndesirability of the women only\nsession in the weights gym in the\nSports Centre. Unless there is a strong feeling in favour then they\nwill be stopped. Can you phone\n3501. come in or send me a note if\nyou have any thoughts on this.\nThanks Finally, thanks must go to the\nstudent who wrecked the Union photocopier this week by putting the\nwrong transparencies in it.

The main aim of this is\nto make (and break) Union policy\non any issue that affects you. For instance if the current state of\nSouthside Bar concerns you then\nyou could propose a motion forcing\nthe sabbaticals to campaign for\nbetter premises. Motions can also\nforce a Union stance on issues such\n'as\"the Ayatollah's statement about\nSalman Rushdie. As you can see\nabsolutely anything can be proposed\nat a EG M whether it is passed or\nnot is another matter.\nThe next step after submitting\nyour motion is turning up to the\nGeneral Meeting where it will be\ndiscussed. The Chairman will call\nthe proposer to speak for the motion\nand then for objections from the\nfloor. Discussion will ensue from\nthere, hopefully ending in a vote.\nIf the vote is in favour then the\nmotion will be passed as Union policy.\nIf you' d like to submit a motion\nor feel strongly about something\nand would .like someone else to\nsubmit a motion on it then please\ncome and see Zoe Hellinger (Union\nPresident), Steve Farrant (Hon Sec\n(Events)) or Joe Fernley ( U GM Chair) and we'll help you format\nthe motion and give advice on how\nto get it through the EG M. Don't forget motions to be\nsubmitted by 5.30pm, Tuesday 19\nNovember.\nA Great Event\nAs another week has flown by and\nyou're presently wondering why\nFriday morning lectures always\nlook like Felix reading marathons\nyou'll be glad to know that Rag\nWeek is upon us. Penguin will have\ngiven details elsewhere but do go\nto the events.\nGuilds Carnival( Tonight)\nThe Union bar will only be open to\npeople attending the carnival so\ndon't turn up at Beit Quad just for\nthe bar. Please bring your Union card if you do w nat to come in.\nPublicity\nThere will be a review of publicity\nspace allocations at the end of the\nmonth.

Blues and Prince In A Pauper's Grave to Rubbish and\nSheriff Fatman. Their masterstroke\nis at the moment, their cover of\ntheir support's This Is How It Feels,\na cover which both retains the\noriginal's atmosphere, but attacks\nit with anger and feeling so\napparently missing from the\nInspirals' version. This IS how it\nfeels to be lonely. And God's not\ndead, no, he is alive, and kicking,\nand living in Sarf London.\nNow our highly regarded shit head of an music editor doesn't like Carter. But I think you all know\nexactly what he does like. Cramps\nand Cranes, and his lord Mr. Eldritch. Now I think the Sisters did\na one of the better shows at\nReading, and that Carter were off\nform there. But that was then and\nthis is now. The reason he doesn't like them is because you can hear\nthe words, there's not just a solid\nwall of feedback, that any half wit with an amp could create, because\nthey have a sense of humour,\nbecause they've got life and he's just dying to get one. Ladies and\nGentlemen, a toast: The Revolution.\n. Carter: Unstoppable.\nLise Yates.\nThe Senseless Things\n-Delmar 12\"\nPost-pop-punk or post-punk-pop.\nIf, indeed, the highly questionable\npractice of labelling bands as\nconforming to genres was ethically\nequitable, then either tag would suit\nThe Senseless Things. Melodic\nguitars? Hum. Simplistic Vocals?\nYeah!.\nThey really are ac liche, but at\nleast you'll know what you'll get -the same sort of thing that made the\nMission so endearing - pretty much\nthe same as last time. The same\nhyperactive croon about teenage\nromance and floppy fringed frippery, the same chunky guitar\nchopping, so reminiscent of Discharge and all punk spawn from\nacross the big pond.\nShock Horror! it's an acoustic\nnumber, fw uf fy music from the\nkings of clich e.I suppose they do\nit fairly well, but honestly, it's not\nentirely memorable (neither are the\nrest of the tracks). The Senseless\nThings have been stuck in the same\ngroove since the itching ly catchy 'Is\nis too late' and the general produce\nof that era ('era' is too big a word\nfor it, really). Maybe it's time\nsomeone told them it's1991, but\nwho knows; in the great scheme of\nthings, this kind of retrogressive\nnonsense may yet see it's own\ngrubby face exposed again. Oh, how sweet, how fleeting, how fickle\npublic favour is. Boys, don't hold\nyour breath.\nThe grin n in' twins.\nCandyland\n\u2014 Kingdom\nIn some hideous dreamscape in my\nhead, all three versions of Kingdom\nare sound tracking my distorted\nvisions as they jerk from surreal\nblurs to brief glimpses of reality that\nare horrific ally confusing. Only\nkidding, they're not really. It would\nprobably be a different story if I was\nstoned, but this is not the case.\nHonest.\nKingdom is still rather fine, a drunken, hypnotic dance fu hrer for\nthose times when the strobes start\na flickering and the world goes that\nlittle bit more blip py than usual,\npulsing with an irregular regularity.\nThe other side's quite enjoyable,\ntoo, but I can't see them bringing\nanything new to the party.\nDavid.\nCarter rear their ugly heads again.\nThe Cassandra Complex\n\u2014The War Against Sleep\nIf you're a Eurobeat/Industial/\nTechno freak, you'll know the\nmeaning of Speed, Coke ( TM), mania, more speed etc and buy this\nanyway. For the uneducated, The\nCassandra Complex dare to fuse\nharsh guitars and electro-mania in\nan atomic cocktail.

The Utah Saints proved that,\nso What Can I Do For You? Love?\nHuh. Rather, One Millionth Happy\nCustomer.

Thrash,\nelectro, indie bop (y ugh) hence the\nschizophrenia syndrome, ' Who shall we pretend to be?' With JVine\nInch Nails, they are one of the few\nothers who ' discovered' that\nterror ed live guitar can exist at the\nsame time as diseased ' live' technology. Well you may cower,\nyou brain-numbed and blind trend\ndisciples.\nHowever, as a consolation to the\nLost, The Cassandra Complex\ncreate their own Atmosphere for a finale. This is a Lullaby For The\nFirst Baby Born In Outer Space.\nThis is the Cyberpunx revolution.\nThe Dissident\nTo the individual who left\nthe Felix Office on Friday\nafternoon with a record case\ncontaining a collection of\n12\" records by The Sisters\nOf Mercy and other bands.\nTheir prompt return would\nbe appreciated as they are\nnot yours, I'm quite close to\nyou now; 'Vinyl Experience'\n(\nCamden) wouldn't take the\nrecords, would they?

Impress is a 'Business Expansion Scheme'( BES) company, and will pay\nCollege about \u00a32.9 million for the\nremainder of the estate.\nMr Malcolm Aldridge, Controller of IC's Financial Services, told Felix that BE S was\ninvented in 1983 by the\nGovernment to encourage small\nbusinesses by giving tax incentives.\nInvestors in the company are\nvirtually guaranteed a dividend,\nthough they must invest for a minimum of five years. Investors\nbought shares at \u00a31 each, to a total\nof \u00a34.5 million, and these will be\nbought back for \u00a31.45 at the end of\nthe five years. 'Impress' are to use\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, plans to\nguarantee College ac como dati on to\nall female IC students for the\nentirety of their course and to all\nfirst year students, even when they\nlive in London. These points were\nmade in a letter sent to all\nDepartmental heads this week. It\ncomes in the same week in which\nfigures were released by\npolytechnics which show that they\nhave a far greater number of\nstudents and thus a larger\nproportion of public money than\nUniversities.\nThe offer of ac como dati on made\nin the letter ended with the comment\nthat 'it is acceptable to make both\noffers to all prospective first years'.\nThe issue has been discussed by the\nApplications Policy Group ( APG) Felix has received a copy of a report\nclaiming that the Management\nSchool has been abusing the\nregulations for staff entering the\nschool. Until last year all staff of\nthe University of London and their\nchildren were entitled to attend the\nMBA Management Course free of\ncharge. This resulted in the\nover subscription by staff and the\nschool losing money. The Management Planning Group( MPG) stopped this entitlement in\nJanuary of this year.\nThe document claims that the\nhead of the Management School,\nProfessor D Norburn, changed\nthese rules over the summer and so\ntheir money buying property from\nthe College, and they will receive\nthe investment plus interest back\nfrom College at the end of five\nyears. In effect, the College is\ngetting a cheap loan for the interim\nyears which will reduce the\nresidence budget deficit.\n'Impress' is authorised to invest\nonly in letting s of residential\naccommodation and assured\ntenancies. Clayponds is an assured\ntenancy, which involves a contract\nsigned by both parties and the\noption of changing the rent to fit the\ncurrent market. Students living at\nClayponds do not have the option\nof going to an independent rent\ntribunal, as many assured tenancy\nholders do. The rent is decided by\nthe Rector on the advice of the\nCollege's Residence Advisory Committee. Mr Aldridge told Felix\nwho oversee College intake, who\nhave rejected the offer of having\nwomen in halls for all the time they\nare in college. Mr David Atkins of\nthe Applications Office said 'we\nshould not offer ac como dati on we\ndo not have.'\nLore t toO' Callaghan, IC Accomodation Officer, said that the\nproposals sounded 'like an excellent\nrecruitment drive' and that a large\nnumber of women on campus\nshould be encouraged from a 'safety\npoint of view.'. When asked about\nthe chance of ac como dati on being\nover-subscribed she replied that the\nscheme 'could work if deadlines for\nac como dat ions were strictly kept\nto.' Zoe Hel linger, Union President, attended the APC and\ntold Felix afterwards that the\nallowed his son to enter without\npaying any fees. When asked about\nthe changes, Professor Norburn\nsaid the situation was 'under\nnegotiation' and when questioned\nabout any children of the\nmanagement entering the school\nthis year he replied 'no comment.'\nTony Cullen, College Admissions\nDirector, said 'no one should be\ngetting a free course out of the\nManagement School, if they are I want to know about it.' The IC\nAssociation of University Teachers\nwho apparently produced the\nreport, were unavailable for\ncomment.\nthat this was 'not because we want\nto be oppressive landlords - or the\nBE S come to that,' but because\nrents in all College owned residences should be decided\nconsistently.\nAccording to Mr Aldridge, residents of Clayponds, who have\nto sign a five year rental agreement,\nhave a right to terminate their\ncontracts early, but no reciprocal\narrangement exists for the College.\nThis means that if a student finishes\ntheir study before the end of their\nrental agreement they do not have\nto move out of the ac como dati on at\nthat point. Mr Aldridge added that\nthe BE S 'doesn't really benefit\nstudents living in residences at all\nin terms of rents and such - only\nbenefits on wide and long term view\n.... what's good for College residence account is good for\nproposals were general y rejected.\nShe added that the idea of female\nac como dati on for the entire length\nof their course was 'sexist' and\n'taking positive discrimination too\nfar.'\nThe college has also asked\ndepartment heads to keep in contact\nwith prospective students as they\napproach the time when they enter\ncollege. The Rector also\ncommented in his letter that with the\nLondon allowance, IC students\nwere in a financially 'neutral'\nposition when higher rents were\ntaken into account.\nOn Thursday the Rector will be\nanswering questions in Huxley 213\nat 5.30pm. Questions can be\nsubmitted to Zoe Hellinger, Union President, beforehand.\nPoison\nPen\nA chain letter has been received by\nsome students in the Mechanical\nEngineering Department. The letter\nis headed 'With love all things are\npossible' and is typed. It is signed\nby 'St Jude' and contains promises\nof wealth and 'good luck' if the\nletter is continued and threats of\npersonal danger and death if the\nchain is broken.\nJonathan Griffiths, Union Deputy\nPresident, said 'this letter is\ninsulting to the intelligence, if it\nweren't so hard I'd use it as\nAnd rex.' students.'\nSo far 14 flats in Clayponds\nbelong to 'Impress', and 6-7\nstudents have signed the contract.\nWhen the remainder of the estate is\ncompleted, this will also be sold to\n' Impress'. Originally it was\nintended that an alternative part of\nthe estate was to be sold, but it was\nrealised in August that by the time\nthe money would be raised, the\nrelevant bit of the estate would have\nbeen occupied - and so, under the\nrules of the BE S, could not be\nbought by 'Impress'. By the time\nthe deal is completed 3 0 % of\nClayponds will belong to 'Impress'\nand 7 0 % to the College. This will\nnot make any difference in the rents\nor payment methods, said Mr Aldridge, and the estate will be\nmanaged as a whole by the College.\nClosed\nThe College libraries closed early\nlast Friday because of the\nwithdrawal of labour by security\nstaff. Usually at that time there are\nonly three librarians working in the\nbuilding and an employee of the\nlibrary said 'that the three librarians\ncould not be expected to work in the\nbuilding with no security'.\nCarnival\nCleared\nThis evening the Students Union\nbuilding will be cleared by 7.30pm in preparation for the Guilds\nCarnival, the first event of Rag\nWeek.

    "content": "1\n5 November1991 Felix 917 Union\nThe best way to describe the\nUnion Committee structure is as an\nonion: a complex layered structure\nof committees, power and\nresponsibility. Trying to cut\nthrough the layers and trace its\nworkings can bring tears to your\neyes. In this, and following articles,\nthe Union will be peeled apart layer\nby layer.\nDefinition of Terms\nUnion Officers: These are unpaid,\nelected students that are responsible\nfor a small area of the Union's activity, and answerable to the\nUnion General Meeting ( U GM). These include Transport, Publicity,\nPost-Graduate Affairs, Housing,\nWelfare, Rag, Ents, Women's and\nmany others.\nSabbaticals: These are paid\nUnion Officers that work full time\nfor the Union. The Union Office\nsabbaticals are responsible for the\nday to day running of the Union. This includes responsibility for the\nmajor areas of the Union's work\nand to represent the students on\nCollege committees. The final\nsabbatical is the Print Unit Manager/Felix Editor, who ensures\nthat the Union can produce publicity\nand documents at the appr opiate time.\nStudents are automatically members of Imperial College Union\n(ICU) and for whose benefit the\nUnion is run. Any student has the\nright to attend any Union meeting\nwhere they will have observing\nrights, except disciplinary hearings.\nSpeaking rights are given at\nUG M/EG M( Extraordinary General Meetings) and at the\nchairperson's discretion.\nThe Union General Meeting\nThe most powerful Union organisation is the U GM. These\nmust be held at least once a term,\nand it is here that the students of\nImperial College Union are\nrepresented. EG Ms can be called by\nanyone if they collect the signatures\nof at least 100 Union members. At every meeting there must be 250\npeople to satisfy quorum - a mere\n4% of the student population. All the Union Officers and sabbaticals\nmust attend to be questioned on\ntheir written reports (the Felix\nEditor does not submit a written\nreport), after which they are\nnormally accepted. The Union Executives usually present a few\nterse sentences to explain their\nactions of the last month. The\nOfficers are then subjected to an\nintensive questioning session from\nthe floor, after which the report is\npassed.\nOnce all the reports have been\npassed the motions, submitted by\nany student in advance to the\nChairperson, are debated and voted\nupon. If passed they become Union\nLaw and must be obeyed by all\nofficers. These can cover such\ndiverse topics as the role of women\nat IC, and what can be done to\nservice their needs, to the mental\nstability and competence of the\nFelix Editor or any other sabbatical.\nMotions are easy produce and can\nrange from the serious to the very\nsilly. Anything can be proposed,\nbut whether it is passed depends on\nthe attenders at the U GM. Recent\nhighlights include an attempt for\nsabbatical salaries to be increased\nto \u00a320,000, and a motion defining\nthe Union stance on student loans.\nHere is an example of a motion:\n\u2022 ICU Notes: 1. That the President\nglows too brightly in diffuse\nsunlight and/or ultraviolet light. 2.\nThat the Deputy President is always\nwell dressed. 3. That the Hon Sec(Events) has no dress sense at\nall. 4. That the Felix Editor ought\nto wear cleaner trousers.\n\u2022 ICU Believes: 1. A smart\nuniform would improve the\nappearance of the sabbaticals at\ntheir frequent public displays and\naround their respective work places.\n\u2022 ICU Resolves: 1. That standard\nsabbatical uniforms should be\ndesigned. 2. Sizes suitable for all\nthe sabbaticals to be purchased.\n\u2022 ICU Instructs: 1. All sabbaticals\nmust wear their appr opiate uniform\nat all times.\nAll motions are based on these 4\nparts: factual information, the\nreason for the motion, the aims of\nthe motion, and how that motion\nwill be implemented. They must\nalso have a proposer and second er. Council\nThis is a more streamlined version\nof aUG M with all the. students\nrepresented by their departmental\nrepresentatives, through their\nsocieties by their respective Major\nSub Committee ( MSC), and by\ntheir Constituent College Union( C CU) \u2014 City& Guilds College\nUnion, Royal School of Mines\nUnion, Royal College of Science\nUnion or St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School Union. All Union Officers are answerable to these\nmeetings and must attend.\nDebate can be very vigorous\nwhen major issues are being\ndiscussed. Recently one of the first\nmotions to reach the floor was to\nban smoking at Council and all\nUnion Committees. Two out of the\nfour sabbaticals were vigorously\nopposed to this motion, and they\nretaliated by amending the motion\nto include the eating of chocolate.\nThis was passed, annoying both the\nPresident, and Marc Ellis (a.k.a. Penguin, Rag Chairman), who\nspent the rest of the meeting sniffing\nat his chocolate bar.\nMajor Sub Committees (MSC)\nThe purpose of the six MSC s is to\nrepresent the interests of the\nstudents through their clubs and\nsocieties affiliated to ICU. The Social, Cultural and Amusements\nBoard ( SCAB) is responsible for all\nof entertainment societies. Publications Board (Pub Board)\nrepresents the media societies, i.e. print, radio and television. The Athletics Clubs Committee ( ACC) represents all the sports teams that\nplay in leagues. Recreational Clubs\nCommittee ( RC C) is in charge of\nall clubs that indulge in recreational\nactivities. Overseas Clubs Committee (OSC) provides a social\nstructure for foreign students.\nFinally the Social Clubs Committee\nis responsible for religious, political\nand pressure groups, and\nmiscellaneous societies.\nUnion Finance Committee (UFC)\nThis very important committee\nalways guarantees vigorous debate\nas everyone scrambles for the few\npennies tossed into the air by the\nDeputy President (DP) who is the\nchairman of these meetings. The biggest hot potato this year was\ndeftly handled by the DP when\nresponsibility forms were discussed. These forms were\ncreated by last year's sabbaticals to\ndefine who in the Union is\nresponsible for the organisation of\nevents, and the activities of the\nsocieties. Their implementation this\nyear led to one resignation in an\nMSC and threats of many others.\nMOTIONS\nfor\nEGM\nThursday 28 Nov\nl pm, Due in by\n5.30pm Tuesday 19 Nov\nHand into Union Office.\nFor more info see article\nin this FELIX.

I knew that,\nbut it is difficult to imagine one man\nhaving quite such a profound effect\non so many people's lives.\nWhen talking about someone who\nstarted off playing trumpet behind\nBillie Holiday, arranged music for\nCount Basie and went on to produce\nMichael Jackson's Thriller album,\nit becomes clear that Quincy Jones\nis a very big name in the history of\nAmerican jazz and popular music.\nWe also get a glimpse of the\nbackground of this successful black\nAmerican as he wanders through\nthe Seattle neighbourhood where he\nonce lived and recounts vague\nmemories of his mother who was\nmentally ill. Looking at some of this\nfootage it is quite difficult to see\nhow someone could emerge from\nsuch poverty to become an\ninternational star.\nQuincy Jones' creativity has\nspanned almost four decades from\nits beginnings with his close friend\nRay Charles, through to his\nassociations with jazz greats such as\nCount Basie, Charlie ' Bird' Parker,\nDizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis, all\nof whom are chronicled in this film\nwith interviews and archive footage. We are brought up to date\nwith clips of Michael Jackson and\nWhitney Houston along with\ninterviews with Melle Mel and\nother contemporary musicians. The\namount of material within this film\nis quite phenomenal, it's all laced\ntogether well and never becomes\nconfusing.\nYou don't have to be a jazz fan\nto enjoy this film, it's a portrait of\na man who has had a very big\ninfluence on American musical\nentertainment in many forms.\nOne small criticism I would have\nis that there's too many small\nsnatches of the music and it would\nhave been nice to hear a good blast\nof each song, but then again, with\nover sixty pieces featured, it would\nhave taken all night.\nRose Atkins. A Woman Destroyed\nFirstly, I must apologise for\nsubmitting this review so late; it's a cock-up entirely on my part. I grossly underestimated how long A Woman Destroyed was running for.\nThis means that tomorrow's show\n(9th November) is the last one.\nSorry.\nThe play is running for the short\nperiod of just three weeks, not, I may add, for want of punters and\ncritical acclaim. Indeed, applause\nfrom some journalistic quarters has\nbeen quite deafening. And that, I feel, is what this play is about: a tour de force - a very high brow,\ncritical exercise rather than a performance that foremost claims to\nentertain.\nMuriel is alone and lonely during\nthe Parisian winter festivities,\ndeserted by husband and offspring.\nDriven by frustration, she bears her\nguilt-ridden soul to the audience in\na one and a half hour monologue\nwhich lacks a little structure. Diane\nQuick, sole actress and translator of\nSimone de Beauvoirs play, strides\naround the stage in a beautifully\nwretched manner which, by its\nconclusion, can't help but to\ndepress. The play DOES have a little humour such as the line: \" My doctors prescribed me\ntranquil is ers.... the man's a sadist!\nthese are suppositories!\" which\nraised a chuckle but otherwise, so\ndevoid of humour, so bleak, you' ll leave the auditorium thoughtful if\nnot melancholy.\nIf you feel like a piece of deep,\nthought provoking stuff then you'll\nenjoy this, though I think it'll appeal\nmore to females than males. I found\nit intriguing... but not compelling.\nA Woman Destroyed is showing\nat the Hammersmith Lyric until the\n9th of November.\nSW CT GP( Somebody Who Couldn't Think of a Good Pseudonym)\nMonster in a Box is the latest in\nSpalding Gray's hilarious autobiography monologues and\nroughly picks up where Gray's Swimming to Cambodia left off.\nIn the film Gray tells of all the\ninterruptions he created, discovered\nand experienced in order to avoid\nwriting his enormous (1,900 page)\nautobiographical novel\u2014it being the\nMonster of the title.\nThe interruptions Gray describes\ninclude a trip to the Soviet Union in the company of several Hollywood stars for a Soviet film\nfestival, a residency in Los Angeles\nfunded by 'a grant to find people in\nLA not involved in the film\nindustry' (LA\u2014The Other), a trip\nto Nicaragua, and his cat as tropic experiences as the lead in Thornton\nWilder's Our Town on Broadway.\nWherever Gray goes mayhem\nand turmoil is certain to follow. The\ndirector Nick Broomfield (whose\nwork includes the hilarious documentary for Channel Four,\nThe Leader, His Driver, the\nDriver's Wife. Laurie Anderson's music and Gray's script and\nperformance create a self-deprecating, ironic New York voice\nwhich is quite distinct from, say,\nWoody Allen's. We enter Gray's consciousness and discover the\nbusiness that comes from too much\npossibility and relish Gray's unequal struggle to maintain some\nsort of balance whilst his inner\ndemons work their way through his\nsystem.\nTuesday, 'December 10, 1991\n7:00 - f fot 'Mufted'Wine in the Consort Qaffery\n7:30 - College Christmas Dinner \u2022'Main 'Dining 9f afC8:30 Carols \u2022 with the Coffer; Choir\n9:00 - Conversation ...

They will go in next\nweek. Please try to keep to the\ndeadline of12.30 Monday.\nThe Union Onion\nSteve Newhouse's article on the\nstructure of the Union on the page\nfacing started its tiny life as a space\nfiller because when I did the page\nallocation on Monday there was a large hole left over. It has turned\nout to be a very interesting exercise\nin management structure - the\nUnion cannot be drawn in two\ndimensions; the minimum required\nis at least six. One of the main\nsticking points are the Constituent\nCollege Unions ( CC Us) which are\nsmaller versions of the main Student\nUnion, and are financially subservient to it. The conundrum is\nexemplified by the position of St\nMary's College Union which was\ndescribed at the last Council meeting as an 'independent and\nautonomous C CU'. Independent,\nautonomous and constituent? There\nis considerable scope for improvement in efficiency in Union\nstructure; there appears to be a large\namount of repetition of services and\nmuch difficulty on the part of the\nstudent as to who they should\napproach for what service. I honestly don't know the answer and\nI am not trying to victim is e any or\nall of the CC Us, it just seems rather\nbizarre.\nSecurity Guards It has to be said that the College\nauthorities are, once again, playing\ntheir card in a high handed manner.\nVirtually the entirety of College\nmessengers and security have been\ntold that their services will not be\nneeded as of next February to make\nway for private contractors. I attended the Trade Union meeting\nlast Monday, attended by many\nsuch messengers, which seemed to\nbe heavily steamrollered by Derek\nDollar d, president of the\nManufacturing, Science and Finance Trade Union. He seemed\nintent on convincing those attending\nthat a strike was inevitable and\ndesirable. One of those attending\nsaid rather bitterly that the Student\nUnion had done nothing to help\nthem, whilst looking at me. This\nmakes me cross. Firstly, Iam not\na representative of the Student\nUnion, I am the editor of the\nStudent Union newspaper, and\nsecondly it is not the job of the\nStudent Union to protect the\nmessengers unless it is obvious that\nsuch action will adversely affect\nstudents. It is not obvious.\nStrange Letters\nOccasionally we receive unsolicited\nmail at the Felix office.

    "content": "Security Privatisation\nCollege security staff are to be\nreplaced by private contractors,\naccording to Gordon Marshall,\nDirector of College Estates. In a letter to all security, messenger and\ntraffic staff on the South Kensington\ncampus, he said that due to a 'need\nto modernise systems' the College\nwas proposing to 'contract out the\nwhole of this area of operations'.\nIn a meeting of all affected staff\nlast Monday, Derek Dollar d, President of the Manufacturing,\nScience and Finance Trade Union( MSF), said that he believed that\ncosts would not in fact be cut, but\ncollege would be 'wasting it\nsomewhere else'. He added that\n'nobody will get anything out of this\nexcept outside contractors'. He called for the unions to 'shut down\nthis place on the day of the\nGoverning Body meeting(4 December) subject to the\nresult of a ballot, of course.' This ballot is due to be taken on\nWednesday.\nIn his letter, Gordon Marshall\nstated that a period of one month's consultation was left open to talk\nwith the unions. Steven Newbold,\nDirector of Marketing, inferred that\nwithdrawal of the proposal was\nunlikely, stating that the proposal\n'would not have been brought\nforward at an immature stage'. The\nstaff under threat have been given\nthe hope that they can be redeployed\n'within the college, or elsewhere in\nthe University of London'. If this\nis not possible then the staff will\nhave to take voluntary redundancy,\nor have compulsory redundancy\nforced upon them.\nSue Sharp, secretary of IC MSF, told Felix that although the matter\nwas 'under negotiation, it didn't look hopeful.' She added that a petition is to be posted at messenger\ndesks and will be passed on to the\nRector, Sir Eric Ash, when enough\nsignatures are amassed.\nThe Fire Brigade were called out\nlast Friday to the Mechanical\nEngineering building when the\ndepartmental superintendent, Colin\nRogers, attempted to clear the\nbuilding by setting off the fire\nalarm.\nMr Rogers explained that he had\nbeen given the job of manning the\nmessengers desk whilst the\nmessengers and security were at the\nTrade Union meeting. When the\nbuilding had to be cleared at 5.30\nprior to being locked for the\nweekend, the fire alarm was set off.\nThe authorities in Sherfield had not\nbeen notified that there was no fire,\nso the Brigade were called.\nMr Rogers told Felix that 'he did\nnot think anything when he saw the\nfire engines, since fire engines are\ncontinually driving up and down\nExhibition Road' and added that on\nreflection he was ' acutely embarrassed' and 'would do it\nbetter next time.' A spokesman for\nthe fire brigade said that they must\ntreat every call as if it were a real\nfire and that they only hoped that\nwhen called to these incidences they\nwere not being called away from\nreal incidences which threatened\nlives.\nEGM\nThere is to be an Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting( EG M)on Thursday 28 November, in Me chEng220. The posts of Welfare\nOfficer, Publicity Officer and\nTransport Officer will be contested.\nPapers for these posts are on the\ncentral staircase, opposite the Union\nOffice, in Beit Quad.\n\n"

Not so ooo h, wow, gosh (but more like he's getting on a bit), Richard Dreyfuss!\nThis is a comedy\u2014what's that I hear you say: Richard Dreyfuss?\nComedy? Naaah! Well if Arnie can\ndo it so can anybody (well o.k. let's leave ICS F members out of this).\nYes this is a comedy, and one of the\nbetter ones around at the moment.\nMulti phobic Bob Wiley (Bill\nMurray) is a very nutty guy; even\nhis phobias have ' phobias. To overcome his problems he enlists\nthe help of Dr Leo Marvin( Rich).\nDr Marvin is a highly respected,\negotistical, fame loving psychiatrist.\nHowever he's going on holiday\nwith the fam and Bob wants help badly. So Bob and his pet fish Gil cleverly ferret out the Marvin s' private vacation hideaway. Tracking Leo down, Bob innocently\ninsinuates himself into the lives of\nthe Marvin family, who all come to\nadore the guest who won't leave all except Leo, who is taking a leisurely stroll into the twig let zone.\nUnable to regain control of his life\nLeo hits upon a plan to get rid of\nBob, a development that leaves\neveryone wondering who's crazy\nand who isn't. Bob is brilliant\u2014he seems to\nthink that everything Leo does to\nget rid of him is some sort of\nrevolutionary new therapy\u2014even\ndeath therapy!! This film was very\nwell thought out, the laughs aren't squashed into ten minutes of the\nfilm, and most of them are (for\nonce) funny. Bill Murray is\nCity Slickers\nCity Slickers is the latest comedy\nwith Billy Crystal, the guy from\nWTien Harry Met Sally, playing the\npart of Mitch, a man who has just\nturned thirty-nine, is stuck in a boring job, and is thoroughly fed up\nwith his lot in life. (Actually he's playing the same wise-cracking\ncharacter he played in WHMS, but\nhe's still very funny, so who\ncares?). When his friends, Phil and\nEd, come up with the idea of going\non an all-American cattle-drive to\nraise his spirits, Mitch's wife insists\nhe goes in order, as she put it, to\nfind his smile.\nAlong the trail, the three friends\nlearn they didn't know as much\nabout each other as they thought;\nPhil has been cheating on his wife,\nwith the checkout-girl at the\nsupermarket he runs, and hot pants Ed is in emotional turmoil about\nhaving children with his young new\nwife, afraid of the level of\ncommitment. Through hardship\nthey become much closer, as they\nslog through the harsh reality of\ncowboy life, herding cattle,\ndelivering calves, and trying not to\nget killed by the leader of a group,\nthe menacing Curly, played brilliantly by Jack 'Snub Nose'\nPalace.\nCity Slickers is a wonderful\nmovie, and was deservedly a huge\nhit at the American box-office,\ntaking in more than $110 million.\nCrystal is in hilarious form, and he\nis well supported by Daniel Stern\nand Bruno Kirby, playing his\nfriends, and Patricia Wetting as his\nlong-suffering wife. Many of the\nscenes, however are stolen by\nNorma, the wide-eyed calf whom\nMitch dei ivers. The appearance of\nNorman onscreen seldom failed to\nraise an 'a aar' from the audience.\nThis film has everything\u2014comedy,\naction, heartache, and bullshit\n(literally). It's a simple tale told\nvery well, and It hro roughly recommend it.\nRonnie C. excellent, showing everyone how\ntruly versatile he is. In fact the only\nreally annoying bit of the film is\nwhenever Leo' s wife Fay (played\nby Julie Hagerty of Airplane fame)\nopens her over sweet mouth, you\njust want to use some death therapy\non her.\nOn the whole then, well worth a few quid. You won't be sorry you\nsaw this film. What About Bob?\nYes (now where's that therapy\nbook).\nPoo.\nWe are pleased to bring you, for\none week only, the fabulous Quincy\nJones! Yes, this week sees the\npublication of the legendary Life\nAnd Loves of Quincy Jones by our\nvery own Rose Atkins, coinciding\nwith the first anniversary of the\npress screening.

We were totally\nabsorbed by the whole energy of the\nband, hit by vibe after vibe of wholesome goodness, right up to\nthe inevitable encore, Kiss, the most\nspectacular cover of this old classic\nyou're ever likely to hear. For those\nwho don't know, The Gutter\nBrothers can often be seen busking\nin Covent Garden, they've done the\nentire soundtrack for Harry Enfield's new T.V. series Gone to\nthe Dogs, and you can see them\nnext at the Borderline, November\n23rd.

    "content": "1\n5 November1991 Felix 917 Letters\nGrow up a little Dear Adam,\nAgain we see apathy mentioned\nwith respect to IC students both in\nthe realm of issues that affect\nstudents (Poll Tax, (see you all in\ncourt on the 21st), student loans and\nall the other ridiculously unfair and\nstupid educational reforms brought\nin by the present government) and\nin connection with college and\nUnion activities.\nThe first issue is most crucial \u2014\nnot enough students make not\ndifficult circumstances. This could\nbe due to the existence of sabbaticals and a more committed\nbreed of students being involved on\nthe organisational side (for instance\nthe OS C, with whom I have\ncontact, being the secretary of IC JapanSoc).\nIn short, although not perfect,\nICU does OK. Let's look at the CC Us, or more\nspecifically R CSU as that is the one\nI 've been a member of for five\nenough fuss about the slings and\narrows hurled at them from on high\nthat make living as a student in\nLondon as opposed to simply\nsurviving, damn nigh impossible.\nThis is very, very sad (unless of\ncourse you happen to agree with the\ngovernment, can't imagine why).\nSecondly, Union matters. This\ncan be conveniently divided into\ntwo ICU and the CC Us.I CU,I believe, although still slightly\ninfected with the disease that\ndeludes the sufferer into believing\nthat everybody needs them and that\nthey are more important than they\nreally are, does basically a good job\nin terms of events, the Union Bar\nand the like. They work well under\nyears (can the others be much\ndifferent?). I'm prompted to write\nmostly as a result of reading the\narticle on Mascot ry in both\nBroadsheet and Felix. This seems\nto typify the CC Us. Mascotry, for\nheaven's sake why? Like most of\nthe things connected with CC Us it\nstrikes me as a complete waste of\ntime, trying to steal little bits of\nmetal during missions planned to\nalleviate the severe sexual\nfrustration no doubt felt by these\nsad' immature cases. If the\nmascot e ers applied themselves to\ntheir respective degrees with the\nsame level of enthusiasm as they do\nto mascot ry then the intellectual\nstatus of the college might just rise\na little. Grow up a little.\nR CSU is no better. Silly, immature little people who still\nthink farts are funny, swapping\nstories about how drunk they can\nget and no doubt lying (for\ninformation I fall over after two\npints of weak lager). If anyone is\nsad enough to want into this little\nclique, they should be prepared on\nthe whole to fail their degree\n(usually Physics) (I open this second\nbracket to remind people that\ndegrees are after all what the loose\norganisation posing as the\nGovernment pay most of us to get),\nsing a ridiculous tribal tune (to my\nshame I do know the words) and get\ninto SciFi as an excuse to face\nreality. Anyone who doesn't believe\nme should read Broadsheet (making\ntwo of us) and sample that rapier\nwit of the contributer s. It's pathetic,\nit's clique y and in case they didn't know it C CU hacks are normally\nregarded as figures of ridicule or\nwan kers, or both. When are you\ngoing to learn, apart from the hacks\nthemselves, for whom the\norganisations really exist to\nserve\u2014Nobody gives a s**t about\nthe R CSU( and I suspect, the other\ntwo). I don't know how much the\nCC Us receive from the Union per\nstudent, but I'd prefer my share\ncash in hand right now\u2014backdated\nuntil 1987 if it's all the same to you\nas I have seen no benefit\nwhatsoever.\nAs for the hacks, it's not too late,\nrealising and admitting that you\nhave got a problem is half of the\nbattle as they say. What is the point\nin trying to perpetuate the worn out\nold myth that IC has got college\nspirit when you know that that's a load of crap. I 've seen more spirit\nat the annual convention of Alcoholics Anonymous\u2014let's all be\nhonest. Before you all say 'but with\ntw at s around like you, there never\nwill be a college spirit' I really don't give a s**t, we all find our own way\n(as Confucius said).\nWhatever we do, let's stop the\npretence that CC Us have a vital role\nto play that the word ' C CU hack'\nis anything more than a term of\ndisparagement. Abolish the\nmascots, abolish the CC Us and let\nthe associated clubs make out on\ntheir own. Oh by the way, mine's a bottle of 1080, anyone here read\nthe new Asimov novel? Kangela\narma do la,k angela arma do la... come\non everyone you know the words...\nMatthew 'Mary' Slater,\nAromatherapy PG II.\nAntiwar in Gulf Dear Adam.\nI am writing to you to protest\nagainst the participation in a meeting of the ' AntiWar in the\nGulf Society held on Thursday\n27th November, by a representative\nof the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Even though I believe\nthat the Palestinians certainly have\na right to voice their opinion,\nespecially in these recent times of\npeace conferences, I feel personally\nthreatened by having a member of\nan active terrorist organisation to\nrepresent them. The person in\nquestion was announced as having\nspent ten years in an Israeli prison\nand one certainly doesn't receive a sentence like that for driving\nthrough a red light.\nUntil the PLO give up their\nongoing terrorist activities, I feel\nthey have no right to a free platform\nin a place like this, especially in a supposedly apolitical college. Only\na couple of weeks ago, an Israeli\nbus was attacked and a mother of\nseven children was among those\nkilled. The PLO have failed to\nrenounce their covenant which\nstates their aims of the destruction\nof the Jewish State and claims that\nevery Jew is a legitimate target for\ntheir terrorist activities. I am sure\nthat you would agree with me in\nhaving meetings like this prevented\nin the future.\nYours faithfully.\nGaby Pell.

    "content": "1\n5 November1991 Felix 917 Clubs & Societies\nHumanist Morals\nThe Evolutionary Basis of Morals.\nHumanists claim that morality is\nbuilt on human nature, not God. Religion does not have a monopoly\non morals and ethics. How can this\nbe achieved?\nWhy be moral? What is morality?\nHow on Earth do human beings\ncome to have morality? These are\nbasic questions. Evolution makes\nparticular difficulty for the third\nquestion, for morality sometimes\nrequires altruistic behaviour - how\ncan animals who evolved according\nto Darwin's theory have come to\nbehave like that?\nThese question certainly require\nsensitive and subtle thinking. The second question gets to the roots of the matter. It has two parts: What\nis it that discriminates the right act?\nWhy does this, whatever it is that\ndoes this job, have the authority to\ndemand that we act accordingly?\nThe scientific understanding of naturalistic evolution states: One cannot derive a value judgement\nfrom a factual statement. The Humanist accepts Hume's Law, and\nat the same time claims that\nevolution is the key that unlocks the\ndoor to morality. That metaphor, of\na key to understanding, is the\nanswer.\nA theory of morality (theistic or\nnaturalistic) will point to something\nwhich (it claims) is ultimately\nimportant; it is valid if what it points\nto is ultimately important, and if the\ntheory draws the right conclusions.\nThe Humanist claims that evolution\ngives us the right understanding of what it is to be human, so that we\nhave the basis from which to draw\nthe right moral conclusions.\nThe above questions will be\ndiscussed (and answered?) in a talk\nby Harry Stopes-Roe on Thursday\n21st Nov at l pm in Huxley 340.\nHarry Stopes-Roe took his first\ndegree in Physics at the RCS and\nthen did Astrophysics research here\nand then Cambridge, but switched\nto Philosophy - his doctorate. He then lectured at Birmingham University on \" Science Studies\":\nwhat science has done to/for us.\nImportantly, science (for him) has\ndestroyed the credibility of a theistic\nview of the Universe. So, how to\nmake sense of Life Morality? The\nobvious answer for him was\nHumanism. This is his \" life stance\" (a term he originated)\nwhich he spent much of his later\nyears lecturing on. He also became\ninvolved with the British Humanist\nAssociation, being its chair for a number of years.\nRugby\nHistory\nRS M RUGBY1991 The story so\nfar:-RS M RFC has two teams this year\nfor anyone who is interested in\nplaying for the best looking team in\nIC. The first XV are undefeated to\ndate and are at present playing as\nthe IC 3rd XV in the U AU competition. Our results so far are\nshown in the accompanying results\ntable.\nOur 2nd XV have had two games\nbeating City & Guilds and just\nlosing to PCL3 rd's. The team spirit\nof this side is second to none. All are welcome to join the RS M club.\nIf you are interested visit the R SMU office or leave a message in the\nRFC pigeon hole. Finally good luck\nto all IC teams for the rest of the\nseason.\nKurt - RS M Captain.\nDribbling\nChamps\nThe Dribblers continued their fine\nrun of victories with a stunning\ntriumph over Hammersmith Hospital last Sunday. Having obviously heard of the Dribblers\nreputation, only eight\nHammersmith girls dared to turn\nout for the 10-0 thrashing.\nCaroline started off the scoring\nwith a goal in the first few minutes\nwhich was almost as amazing as her\nmiss later on in the half. Other goals\nin the game came from Permi (7)\nand Jo (2) with near misses from\nSara, Arlene and Rachael.\nEthel played a blinder in defence,\nas usual??!!??, as did Arlene who\nwas playing her first game for the\nteam. Credit must also go to the\ngoalie Emma, who kept a clean\nsheet and would surely have made\nsome amazing saves had any shots\ncome her way. Hammersmith, quite\nsensibly, didn't attempt to challenge\nthe Dribblers in a boat race!\nFinally, the Dribblers would just\nlike to congratulate Ethel, albeit a little late, for her amazing header\noff the line in the K CH Cup game.\nEthel you're a star, where would\nthe team be without you... top of the league probably!!!\nSPORTS RESULTS\nWOMEN'S FOOTBALL League: Dribblers100 Hammersmith Hospital\nHOCKEY U AU: Mens1 st23 Kings College1 st Ladies 1 - 2 Kings College Ladies\nRS M RUGBY U AU: Mens1 st190R HB NC Mens1 st1210 Reading\nMens1 st680 Kings College NETBALL League: Imperial 4 8 - 3 1 UCL II\nBADMINTON U AU: Mens1 st90 Kings College1 st Mens2 nd90 Kings College2 nd Ladies 9 - 0 Kings College Ladies\nHammersmith League: Mens90 Elliot Mixed90 Spartans\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
