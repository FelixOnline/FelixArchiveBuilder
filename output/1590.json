The\nself-styled HYPER JAPAN Christmas\nMarket succeeds brilliantly in\ncreating a thematic atmosphere,\npresenting not just the Japanese\nproducts, but stages and performance\nareas which emblazon every single\naspect of Japanese culture, from\nidiosyncratic fusion bands to\ntraditional Japanese tea ceremonies\nand dance theatre. HYPER JAPAN\nboldly claims that it is the best\ndepiction of Japanese culture outside\nof Japan, and as an outsider to the\nevent whilst knowing a fair amount\nabout the country, I am utterly\nbought by their claim\nThe event takes place in Olympia\nNational, near Hammersmith and\nWest Kensington. The bottom floor\nhas an array of delicious smelling\nfood stalls, all selling Japanese dishes\nand slightly bigger businesses along\nwith a huge stage at one end, whilst\nthe top floor seemed to be reserved\nfor independent shop-owners and a\nsmaller display area where martial\narts and other demonstrations were\ncarried out.\nFrom any point in the exhibition\nhall, whatever was coming from the\nspeakers beside the stage could be\nheard, and the stage could be seen\nfrom any point on the top floor,\nwhich mean that you never missed a\nthing \u2013 and never had to push your\nway through crowds or fight for seats\nto see what was going on. Between\nperformances, J-POP (Japanese\npop music) greatly enhanced the\nambience of the whole event.\nCosplay, or dressing up as fictional\ncharacters found in anime, manga,\nvideo games, films, etc is a noticeable\ntheme in the convention. Contests\nwere on for the best costumes but\nI only recognised Hatsune Miku,\na \u201chumanoid persona voiced by a\nsinging synthesizer application\u201d after\nwatching a quasi-3D performance in a\nside room of her songs. Sounds pretty\nweird to someone passing by, but I\ngreatly admire the Japanese creative\nspirit and Hatsune Miku has turned\nout to be a massive marketing success\nfor the company behind her.\nAlthough cosplay is one of the loci\nof the event as one of the pillars of\nmodern Japanese culture, it is not by\nfar the main one. In fact, one of the\nmajor successes of the convention\noverall was the fact that there wasn\u2019t\na single, individual focus; rather, a\nsmooth amalgamation of all aspects\nof Japanese culture presented in\ntandem which are consciously\nrecognisable but simply flow together\nand feel natural.\nOn the upper floor, there are a\ngroup of retro arcade machines\nand Japanese video game consoles,\nincluding a Dance Dance Revolution\non which I witnessed meteoric\ncompetition which redefined my\ndefinition of \u201cpro gamer\u201d.\nIn contrast, downstairs belonged to\nbig Japanese video game developers\nsuch as Square Enix and Capcom\nwhich promoted their latest products\nand merchandise.\nSoon the crowd was gathered\naround a sushi stand, and I\nmanaged to find myself witnessing\na tuna cutting display. The show\nculminated with the tuna mercilessly\ndichotomised by a five-foot long\nsword. I can testify that this smooth-filleted tuna beats John West with\nregards to taste and texture by\nformerly unimaginable amounts.\nBy far the most enjoyable was the\nsampling of all the sake, whisky,\nand umeshu alcohols for sale. The\nexhibitors were generous with\ntheir samples and light-headed\ngratification led me to purchase a\nbottle of Choya Umeshu, a delicious\ncitrus-smelling and flavour wine.\nUme is a sweet Asiatic fruit which is\ndescribed as somewhere between an\napricot and a plum.\nThe stage is full with back-to-back\ndisplays of sake mixing, technodelic\nperformances, karaoke, and an\nincredibly diverse, ballpark outline of\nevery imaginable and unimaginable\naspect of Japanese culture. However,\none performer\u2019s story stood out as\nparticularly galvanising. I snuck\nbackstage to get a cheeky interview in\nafter the performance had ended.\nHer name is Diana Garnett, an\nAmerican singer who shot to fame\nlast year by winning Song for Japan,\ndescribed as the Japanese equivalent\nto The Voice, Britain\u2019s Got Talent,\nand the X-Factor all rolled into one.\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to become a singer in\nJapan since I was seven,\u201d Diana tells\nme. \u201cMy dad watched a lot of anime\nso I had exposure to Japanese music\nand I wanted to be a performer before\nI\u2019d figured out all the details, like how\nfar Japan is from Washington DC.\u201d\nTwo girls cosplaying at HYPER JAPAN.

Diana first moved\nto Japan at the age of sixteen, a\ndaunting prospect enough for anyone\nwishing to move to a country with\n0.07% native English speakers. On\nher third and most recent visit to\nJapan, Diana also became an English\nteacher, instructing schoolchildren\naround middle school age. I asked\nher about the motivation behind her\nsinging \u2013 a fervent and passionate\nintensity which can be felt during her\nrenditions.\n\u201cAs a schoolteacher, I often get\nkids coming up to me when they\u2019re\nyoung with their dreams of becoming\nPok\u00e9mon masters, superheroes, and\nfamous ice skaters along with all\nsorts of wonderful things. But then\nthey grow up and settle into their\nperceived reality of just being able to\nlive as an office worker somewhere.\nIt\u2019s heart-breaking. I sing for my\nfans and anyone who happens to be\nlistening, in the hopes that they\u2019ll be\nbrave enough to follow their heart\nonce again.\u201d\nFundamental differences in the\nconstruction of sentences, such as\nomission of articles and subjects,\nall contribute to the difficulty of\nlearning English as a native Japanese\nspeaker. Diana\u2019s songs are all in\nJapanese only; is the language barrier\na problem this way?\n\u201cThe focus of the songs is not\nthe language, but the sound and\nmusic,\u201d Diana tells me. Japanese is\nnaturally a very lyrical and expressive\nlanguage due to its liquid consonants\nand this makes it still remarkably\ncommunicative even to a non-speaker\nlike me. As a musician myself, Diana\nand I concur by bringing up the\nindisputable fact that music is the\ntrue universal language of expression.\nThe realisation of a dream may not\nnecessarily come as a single, cathartic,\nwatershed moment. Diana continues\nto work on her music and she starts\nby collaborating with Joe Inoue,\nannouncing their work on December\n1st. Joe is an American-born Japanese\npop artist whose gained prominence\nthrough his song \u2018Closer\u2019 being used\nfor the opening song of the anime\nseries Naruto. Joe is well-known for\nplaying all the instruments in the\nbacking track when he records a new\nsong \u2013 in fact, his Facebook page\ndescription includes the line \u201cPlays\nall instruments.\u201d I manage to get\na few words with him too, after he\nagreed to marry a fan in the audience.\nIt remains to be seen if he is as true to\nhis word as he is dedicated to the red\nbean ice cream he claims he loves \u2013\n\u201cit\u2019s delicious and healthy,\u201d he claims,\nright before Diana quips back \u201cit\u2019s not\nhealthy, it\u2019s ice cream.\u201d\nJoe was born to Japanese\nimmigrants in California, and learnt\nJapanese from reading manga and\nwatching anime, despite growing\nup in Los Angeles. \u201cI had to teach\nmyself,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut the comics\nare definitely the number one\nJapanese textbook.\u201d As well as playing\nall the instruments in all of his songs\nand composing all of them himself,\nalmost all of his song lyrics are in\nJapanese too. It\u2019s Joe\u2019s first time in\nEurope and he expresses confusion at\nthe reason why the audience weren\u2019t\nreceptive to his American-style jokes\nabout boobs and such on stage. I tell\nhim that they\u2019re just being polite.\nHYPER JAPAN showcased a\nstrikingly extraordinary cultural\nevent, with a very strong inspirational\naftertaste. The message is clear.\nPursue your dream, and you\u2019ll end up\nliving it.\n\n"

With a\nplethora of new features including\na massive 2 inch curved screen,an\naccelerometer and a gyroscope,\nwhen the Gear S (right) arrives it\nwill likely be the best smartwatch\nyou can buy.(Due Early 2015).\nPhoto: Wikimedia commons\nPhoto: flickr.com\nPhoto: slashgear.com\nI watched a South Park episode\nrecently which lampoons the use of\ndrones and depicted how they could\nbe misused by the public on a grand\nscale, resulting in the need for police\ndrones and culminating in riots\nbetween the police and public drones\ncontrolled from the comfort of your\nbed. As I was watching I was just\nassuming that a decent drone with a\ncamera would cost you hundreds of\npounds but with a quick search on\nAmazon I found that you can get one\nfor less than \u00a335!\nX4 Quadcopter\nPhoto: Amazon.co.uk\nut what do you want under the tree?\nSmart Watches\nPhoto: androidpolice.com\nHowever, it is a very attractive piece\nof kit and it runs smoother than\nmost of its competitors. At \u00a3660 it is\nprobably not feasible to buy this for a\nfamily member or a significant other,\nbut for yourself it could be a cracking\ninvestment.\nMoto G 4G\nOne of the hottest budget\nsmartphones you can buy right\nnow, at under \u00a3145 the Moto G is\na fabulous device for the money.\nUnfortunately, the 4G iteration is\nonly available with 8GB of memory\nbut the Moto G has many qualities\nwhich put it on a level playing field\nwith the rest.\nThe second generation G (released\nSeptember this year) has a 1.2GHz\nquad-core processor, a sizeable 5\ninch display and like the 6 Plus, an 8\nmegapixel camera. Its size limits the\nbattery to a capacity of 2070mAh,\nlasting about a day of heavy use.\nHowever, for such a reasonable\nprice, this is almost (as Kevin Bacon\nwould say) a no-brainer.\nAlso worth a look...\nOnePlus One it may be the new kid\non the block but its earned a lot of\nplaudits this year despite beginning as\nan invite-only product. It costs under\n\u00a3260 for the 16GB model.\nThe Sony Experia Z3 Compact offers\neverything from its predecessor apart\nfrom a full HD screen. It\u2019s perfect for\nPlaystation 4 owners with the PS4\nRemote Play feature but also good all\nround in the smartphone department.\nThe Z3 can be found for under \u00a3330\nonline.\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 9\n28.11.2014\nFELIX\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIwas sat in a job interview,\nnervously trying to justify my\nexistence to a stranger and I was\nasked \u201cWhy did you chose to study\nat Imperial?\u201d. I think I managed\nto persuade him it wasn\u2019t because\nCambridge had rejected me and that\nit was in fact, \u201cImperial\u2019s academic\nrigour and forward thinking ethos\u201d.\nIf I\u2019m honest I applied because it was\ntop of the league tables and I came\nbecause I managed to get the grades.\nBut how do aspiring students\nchoose universities? This is the\nquestion a recent report by Which?\ntried to answer. It\u2019s important\nbecause with fees at \u00a39000 per\nannum, sixth form students are\nexpected to make rational consumer\ndecisions and commit to spending\naround \u00a345,000 on a degree. All this\nbefore you\u2019re legally allowed to take\nout a normal loan.\nI\u2019m fortunate. I\u2019m very confident\nthat my \u00a33,450 per year fees are\na worthy investment. Simply\ncomparing the mean Imperial\ngraduate salary with the median\nUK salary is enough to show that.\nBut that isn\u2019t always the case. The\nWhich? survey (which didn\u2019t mention\nImperial specifically) found 3 in\n10 undergraduates thought their\nexperience was poor value and that\n35% said they are \u201cunlikely to have\nattended university faced with\nhigher fees\u201d.\nThe risk that a course is a waste of\ntime and money is not just borne by\nthe student. It\u2019s a loan you\u2019ll only\npay back if you earn enough money,\nso the risk is also with tax payers,\nwho are the very people we tried to\nreduce the burden on by introducing\nfees in the first place.\nIn fact, the government now\nloses 45p of every \u00a31 it lends to\nstudents. Last year the student loans\ncompany paid out \u00a312.5 billion in\nloans to students and that\u2019s set to\nrise. The higher education sector is\nhaemorrhaging money.\nIf you arrive at a university and\nfind that your lectures aren\u2019t quite\nworth the \u00a350 each you\u2019re paying,\nyou\u2019re stuck. There\u2019s no chance\nto transfer to another university\n\u2013 you just have to start again and\npay another set of fees. If you drop\nout completely you have to pay\nback the fees, but you\u2019re not even\na graduate. In most industries the\nconsumer is protected by a regulator.\nIf you buy a broken car, you get it\nreplaced or refunded. But if you get\na useless course, you\u2019re stuck with\nit; no refunds apart from extreme\nsituations. The universities bear a\nvery small amount of risk in the\ngame, it\u2019s the students and the\ngovernment who take the risk. The\nexact opposite of normal business\nwhere the shareholders risk their\ninvestment if the customers leave.\nIf students are to be consumers,\nthen we need the protection and\nrights that come with that. This\nshould be one of the benefits of the\ntuition fee system but it has yet to\nhappen. Why? Because if a course\ncan\u2019t keep its students happy, and\nthey all leave with refunds, that\ncourse won\u2019t be open for long. The\ngood departments will flourish but\nthe poor departments will close.\nIt\u2019s creative destruction capitalism\n\u2013 students got their brunt of the\ndeal when the fees trebled. Now\nuniversities have to face the reality\nof the economic market too, and\nsomething tells me they won\u2019t like\nit either.\nThe transition of the tuition\nfee model won\u2019t be complete till\ndepartments who don\u2019t pay for\nthemselves have to close.\nGEORGE BUTCHER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nAttending University can be a risky business\n\"3 in 10\nundergrads\nthought\ntheir\neducation\nwas poor\nvalue\"\n\"It's the\nstudents\nand the\ngovernment\nwho take\nthe risk\"\nLast year the student loans company paid out \u00a312.5 billion Photo: Mid-Cheshire College\nOn Monday Spanish newspapers reported that BT were\nin talks with Telefonica over\na potential takeover of O2. It later\nemerged that BT are also discussing the purchase of EE from French\ncompany Orange S.A. and German\ncompany Deutsche Telekom. But\nwhat would this mean for us? Should\nwe be worried, or excited?\nThe move from BT shows clear\nintent to enter the mobile market.\nSince spinning off O2 in 2001 (then\ncalled BT Cellnet), BT has often\nregretted not being in the mobile\nmarket. They have made attempts to\nslowly move back in through deals\nwith O2 and EE over the past couple\nof years.\nWith this deal (whoever it may\ncome from) BT will suddenly have a\nmarket share of more than 29% (EE\nactually has 33% at the moment),\nand a platform from which to launch\na new \u2018Quad-Play\u2019 service. Quad-Play\nis a package currently on sale in Europe that offers Internet, television,\nlandline and mobile in one bundle.\nIt has proved to be popular in Europe\nbut is largely unproven in the United\nKingdom. Virgin Media attempted\nit, but with limited success.\nSo, what does this mean for us?\nShould we be worried about rising\nprices as a result?

Having spent more\nthan \u00a32.5 billion to upgrade its fibre\noptic networks and \u00a32 billion on\ntelevision rights in sport, BT have\na lot of money to make up.

When\nBT last spent this much, our line\nrental costs went up by a significant\namount.

Vodafone\nhave already been touted to form\na partnership with BSkyB if BT\u2019s\nmove proves successful, and it is also\nthought that TalkTalk will be looking for a partner.\nOne thing is for sure though \u2013\nmany will watch BT\u2019s next moves\nwith fascination and intrigue.\nBT is moving back into mobile.

Photo: Glamour.com\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Kendall\nJenner by now, then you\nprobably live under a rock. Her\nface has been plastered on every\nmagazine cover, from the likes\nof Vogue to the edgy Dazed and\nConfused. She is part of the new\nwave of social media powerhouse\nmodels, with multiple selfies posted\non her instagram account \u2013 a de\nrigueur daily ritual. Many will\nknow of her from her childhood\nappearances alongside her sisters on\nthe hit US reality tv series, Keeping\nup with the Kardashians. Despite the\nfame she acquired from appearing\non the series, she was determined\nto become a model from an early\nage, without the Kardashian name.\nIn an intervew with Juju Chang on\nNightline, she explained that she\nhas worked hard towards achieving\nher newfound succcess as a model,\nsaying \u201cIn reality I worked pretty\nhard for this, running around\ndoing tests. It wasn\u2019t like I just got\nit magically.\u201d When she was asked\nwhy she wanted to become a model,\nshe said \u201cI would always be looking\nat these supermodels, they were\njust so amazing to me, they were\nlike superheroes\u2026 I want to be some\nlittle girl\u2019s superhero. I want to the\nbest role model I can be to a little\ngirl or a little boy or to anybody.\u201d\nInterestingly, she has asked her\nsisters not to attend her catwalk\nshows, because she feels that this\nwould take the attention away from\nher, especially if her uber-famous\nsister Kim Kardashian West were in\nattendance. Recently, in an attempt\nto distance herself from her Keeping\nup with the Kardashians persona,\nshe dropped her last name so that\nshe would be taken more seriously.\nShe said that she did this at all her\nmodel castings last year, where she\nonly went by her first name. Kendall\nenjoyed her big-break as a runway\nmodel in September, for the Spring/\nSummer 2015 fashion season, which\nsaw her walk the runway for 13\nlabels at New York, Milan and Paris\nfashion weeks. Among some of the\nbig names she walked for were Diane\nVon Furstenberg, Chanel, Givenchy\nand Dolce and Gabbana. Her global\nsuccess as a fashion sensation has\nonly just began, and two weeks ago\nshe announced on her instagram\nand twitter accounts that she would\nbe the new face of beauty cosmetics\nbrand Estee Lauder.\nKendall is not only a hugely\nsuccessful model, but she is also a\nbusinesswoman, much like her older\nsister Kim. With her sister Kylie\nJenner, she has launched a jewellery\nline called \u2018Metal Haven,\u2019 a clothing\nline called \u2018Kendall and Kylie,\u2019 sold\nat US retailer Pacsun, as well as a\nshoe and handbag collection for\nSteve Madden. The budding model\nhas even ventured into writing, and\nin 2014 released a novel co-authored\nwith Kylie called Rebels: City of Indra\n(which was actually ghostwritten by\nMaya Sloan).\nKendall has said that her\nreputation as a reality tv star has\nmade it difficult for her to break\ninto the fashion industry, and she\nhas had to work a lot harder to be\ntaken seriously and build a career in\nmodelling.\nWith her recent rapid rise in\nfashion, rumours about her life\nhave run rampant. Recently, it was\nreported that fellow models were\nmean towards her during fashion\nweek, would bully her backstage\nand put their cigarettes out in\nher drinks. However, in her latest\nmagazine interview with Dazed and\nConfused, Kendall confirms that\nthese rumours are exactly just that:\nrumours. In the issue, which hits\nnewsstands on the 27th\nof November,\nshe said \u201cEveryone\u2019s been really\ncool to me. I\u2019ve never had one girl be\nmean\u2026 so far.\u201d\nThe rumours about her don\u2019t just\nstop at the runway either. Being\nas famous as she is, she has been\nromantically linked to many high\nprofile stars, including Justin Bieber,\nChris Brown, Harry Styles and\nmore recently, Dallas Mavericks\nbasketball player Chandler Parsons.\nEarlier this month, Kendall\ncelebrated her 19th\nbirthday\nat Chateau Marmont in West\nHollywood, where she re-united\nwith her close friend Selena Gomez.\nThe two were feuding after Kendall\nhad been spotted out to dinner with\nJustin Bieber, Selena\u2019s ex-boyfriend.\nIn a recent interview however,\nKendall set the record straight,\nclarifying that her and Bieber\nwere in fact just very close friends.\nAnother rumoured frenemy, Cara\nDelevingne, also attended the party,\nending rumours that the two are\nfeuding. Both Cara and Selena sang\nhappy birthday to Kendall.\nSo, what\u2019s on the horizon for the\nfashion sensation? The star will soon\nbe featuring as the new face of Karl\nLagerfeld\u2019s own fashion label, and\nit\u2019s been rumoured that she may\nreplace Cara Delevingne as the face\nof Chanel. This isn\u2019t so implausible,\nconsidering that Cara Delevingne\nhas announced that she will be\nfocusing more on her acting career\nnext year.\nKendall has compared her busy,\nwhirlwind year to living like\nHannah Montana. She told the\nNew York Times \u201cIt\u2019s definitely two\ndifferent worlds. I feel like Hannah\nMontana. But it\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\n"

The test\nwas scheduled to start at 18:00, and\nwithin ten minutes, students started\nreporting issues with their tests, such\nas images and formulae not loading\nas expected. Shortly afterwards,\nBlackboard went down.\nCourse Lecturer Dr Ralf Martin\nemailed students immediately\nafterwards, telling them he was\n\u201csuper furious\u201d. He told students\nthey had received \u201cmultiple\nassurances\u201d that Blackboard would\nbe able to handle the number\nof students running the test\nsimultaneously. Dr Martin made\nhis opinions very clear to students,\ntelling them in another email \u201cI can\nonly speculate that their [College\nICT\u2019s] server is so badly managed\nthat it cannot handle 450 students.\u201d\nSpeaking to Felix about the\nincident, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t personally\npromised that someone from ICT\nwould be present but it took them a\nlong time to respond, we still haven\u2019t\nhad a formal response. We couldn\u2019t\nreach anybody until reach anybody\nuntil several days after.\u201d\nDr Martin was also unimpressed\nwith apparent issues with Web\nBrowser compatibility, citing other\ntests that had issues due to students\nusing Google Chrome instead of\nFirefox or Internet Explorer, leading\nhim to tell students, \u201cChrome is not\nsome weird exotic browser. Almost\nevery lecture I would spend saying\nnot to use chrome but maybe that\nwas not the reason.\u201d The lack of\ncontact from ICT with Dr Martin\nhas left him confused and still trying\nto understand why it had failed.\nHe speculated that smaller courses\nhave used Blackboard successfully\nwith Chrome, so it was more likely\nan issue with the total number of\nstudents taking the test.\nIn an email to Directors of\nUndergraduate Studies who have\nstudents enrolled on the course,\nEdina Hamzic-Maguire of the\nBusiness School told colleagues that\nthe outage did in fact not register on\nCollege ICT systems. The Business\nSchool were also told by ICT that\nthe \u201ctest will be recorded in the\nteam calendar and someone may\nbe available out of hours to trouble\nshoot\u201d. When it came to the evening,\na phone call to ICT was made, but\nit went straight to a standard out of\nhours message. ICT later told the\nBusiness School that no staff were\navailable to be on standby past 18:00.\nStudents found the cancellation\nand subsequent rescheduling of\nthe test inconvenient, one saying,\n\u201cIt is extremely inconvenient for\nme as I both have interviews and a\nfuneral abroad in the coming weeks,\nmeaning that I will not have much\ntime at all to refresh everything\nwhich I studied for the test.\u201d and\nanother adding \u201cIt\u2019s all very well\nsaying that all we did is \u201cstudy the\nmaterial of a module you signed\nup for,\u201d but the fact is that if there\nhadn\u2019t been the blackboard test I\nwould not have chosen to prioritise\nmy time towards this module. The\nfact that I did so at the detriment of\nmy other modules, job applications,\nand extra-curricular activities,\nonly to find the test cancelled, is\nextremely inconvenient.\u201d\nThe Business School have received\npraise for taking students\u2019 views into\naccount when deciding how best to\nproceed, something most students\nbelieve is unique to the Business\nSchool. \u201cThe business school have\ndone a good job in considering\nwhat\u2019s best for students. An online\nsurvey for the best way to deal with\nthe situation is something most\ndepartments wouldn\u2019t do, and giving\ntwo different dates to do a test isn\u2019t\nsomething I\u2019ve heard of before.\u201d\nAn Imperial College Spokesperson\nwas keen to point out Blackboard\u2019s\ntrack record of reliability, issuing\nthe statement: \u201cThe College regrets\nthat an online Business Economics\ntest scheduled for the evening of\n13 November had to be terminated\ndue to a technical problem\nwith Blackboard \u2013 the College\u2019s\nvirtual learning environment \u2013\nthrough which the test was being\nadministered. Affected students\nwere polled on when the test\nshould be re-run and, to minimise\ninconvenience, two alternative dates\nwill be offered.\n\u201cAdvance checks showed no issues\nwith Blackboard, which has proven\na reliable system for the College,\nwith 99.99% service availability\nbetween Oct 2013 and Oct 2014.\nUnfortunately on this occasion, an\nunforeseen problem occurred.\n\u201cICT is working closely with the\nBusiness School and the supplier\nof Blackboard Learn to determine\nthe cause of the issue and to reduce\nthe risk of a future outage to the\ne-Learning System. The College is\ngrateful for the input of affected\nstudents who have been invited to\nshare what they experienced when\nattempting to use the system during\nthe test.\u201d\nPlanning for the test to be done\nagain is underway. In order to reduce\nthe stress and inconvenience to\nstudents, two different times will be\navailable: one before Christmas, and\nthe other after.\nThe Business School have decided\nnot to use Blackboard for the retests,\ninstead load testing alternative\nsoftware.\nPhoto: Karsten Seipp\n\n"

We do\nnot condone activities that cause\noffence to members of the public\nnor activities that can lead to\npotential damage.\nWe also do not instil a culture\nof excessive drinking of alcohol\nwithin our club.\nWhen these two allegations\nwere placed against the club, my\ncommittee and myself enforced\ninternal club sanctions. For those\ninvolved in the Heston incident,\nall players in the third team were\nbanned from social activities for\ntwo months. For those involved in\nthe coach incident, we enforced a\nclub-wide ban on socialising to end\nmid December. We also introduced\na club Alcohol Policy, and a Tour\nEtiquette Document.\nThese addressed the perceived\ndrinking culture that surrounds\nrugby and they also show that\nwe are addressing the perceived\ndrinking culture surrounding rugby.\nBoth these internal sanctions and\nthese documents have shown the\nextent of our co-operation with the\nUnion, College Tutors and Faculty\nand was our attempt to try and deal\nwith these situations as quickly and\nsmoothly as possible.\nAlthough we understand\nthe sanctions we feel that the\nGovernance Committee overlooked\nthe inancial implications the\nsanctions would have on the club.\nOur club is currently not sitting on\nsteady inancial footing.\nThis is not helped by the fact\nthat Imperial College Union, who\nclaim to treat both clubs for all\ncollege students and medic-centred\nclubs on equal footing, give the\nmedic rugby team 37% less grant\ncompared to IC Rugby; Both IC and\nus have 3 teams, both our First XV\ncompete in the BUCS 1A league.\nWe always exceed our\nmembership targets and we\nbring home more silverware for\nthe university and enter more\ncompetitions as well as earning\nSport Imperial more BUCS\npoints. Somehow the Union have\n\u201cjustiied\u201d this large disparity in\ntheir budgeting system and they\nthen also deemed their inancial\nsanctions towards our club\nappropriate in light of this.\nThese sanctions will enforce a\n\u00a310,000 loss to the club, which will\nrender the club inancially defunct\nby the end of the 2015/16 season.\nI feel that if the Governance\nCommittee were aware the extent\nthe inancial implications would\neffect the club, it could call into\nquestion whether Imperial College\nUnion have an alternative motive\nas to shut down ICSM clubs, to seek\na merger; a rumour that has hung\nover our heads for the past few\nyears.\nAnother point that is particularly\nannoying is that we feel incorrect\nminutes from a previous meeting\nwere passed on to the Governance\nCommittee due to a clerical\nissue, without our knowledge.\nThe minutes were in the revision\nprocess, but the inalised version of\nthe correct minutes never reached\nthe Governance committee. We feel\nthis may have impacted the decision\nmade concerning our sanctions,\nand therefore feel they may be\ndisproportionate to what actually\nhappened.\nI personally also felt\nuncomfortable by the way I was\ntreated by some of the senior\nauthority igures involved with\nthe process, who acted in ways\nI thought were inappropriate\nbordering on aggressive in\nmeetings I had with them. I\napproached Tom Wheeler about\nthese issues I had, and he was\nunable to rectify them, stating he\nwas: \u201c[the authority igure] was\nfrustrated that he was struggling to\nget to an answer [from Cross].\u201d I felt\nthis was reprehensible given I had\nbeen so co-operative throughout\nthe whole process.\nI do not feel that the welfare\nof myself nor my implicated\ncommittee members has been\naddressed by anyone senior at\nImperial, except for Dariush.\nI disagree that ICSMRFC\u201c[does]\nnot instil a culture of excessive\ndrinking\u201das this directly contradicts\nwith the fact that a bottle of Port\nwas listed on the Tour\u2019s kit list\nbecause it is\u201cmore eficient\u201dto\ndrink port.I do not believe that\nthe actions taken by ICSMRFC\n\u2018addressed\u2019the culture,but I do fully\nsupport the Club for taking its irst\nsteps towards doing so.\nOn the complicated subject of\nUnion Subsidy of ICSMRFC compared\nwith ICURFC,the fact of the matter is\nthat they budgeted for signiicantly\ndifferent expected costs in the CSPB\nBudgeting process.ICURFC spends\nconsiderably more on Instructors,\nGround Hire and Travel Expenditure\nand had 17.4% more members at the\nend of last year.\nOn the point regarding a\u201c\u00a310,000\nloss to the club\u201dit must be stated that\nthe Club caused signiicant damage\nto a Coach,which led to signiicant\nrepair cost.The inal invoice came to\njust over \u00a37,200,of which roughly\n\u00a31000 was due to non-window\nrelated repairs (including cleaning\nvomit from toilets).The remainder of\nthe\u201c\u00a310,000 loss\u201dis the opportunity\nloss of ICSMRFC being banned from\nsocial activity until 1 January 2015.\nIt was deemed by the Governance\nCommittee that allowing the Club\nto host a Social event (from which it\nproits ~\u00a32,000) after the Club failed\nto behave properly during previous\nSocial Activity was not acceptable.\nThe conversation referred to\nas\u201cinappropriate bordering on\naggressive\u201ddemonstrated the Chair\nof the Governance Committee\u2019s\nfrustration with Cross and his\nteammate\u2019s assessment of the\nwindow immediately after it was\ndamaged.Some of those present\non the coach at the time decided\nthat the window was only fractured,\nand did not pose a risk to other road\nusers,and therefore did not tell the\ndriver,demonstrating very poor\njudgement.\nThe most frustrating point raised by\nGeorge Cross in his statement is that\nthe decision\u201ccould call into question\nwhether Imperial College Union\nhave an alternative motive as to shut\ndown ICSM clubs\u201d.This is thoroughly\nabsurd.The Union only ever works to\nensure that all members who want\nto participate in Union activity,can.\nWhether the activity is organised\nby a Club that falls within the ACC\n(ICURFC) or a Constituent Union\nsuch as CGC,ICSM,or RSM is\nirrelevant to us.\nThroughout this process,we\nhave offered to sit down with the\nclub and discuss the inancial\nsituation that they are in,and\noffer support where it is needed\nwith a view to ensure activities are\nnot curtailed past their banned\nperiod.This support can take the\nform of allowing the club to use an\noverdraft,for example.We were\nfully aware of the implications of\nthe sanctions at the point of passing\nthem.\nbetter co-operation from the Medical\nrugby players than ICURFC, whose\ncaptain is now facing a vote of no-confidence from Imperial College\nUnion Council, the Medical team\nsanctions may have more adverse\neffects than those of the sanctions\nsuffered by ICURFC.\nDariush stated in his support of the\nappeal that the rulings against the\nMedicals will \u201cfinancially cripple,\nand possibly disband, a club who have\nadmitted their mistakes, have been\nco-operative and have shown their\neagerness to change to ensure similar\nevents do not occur in the future.\u201d\nFelix spoke to Dariush to expand\nupon the issue further. He explained\nthat, with the Medical team unable\nto acquire sponsorship as easily as\nICURFC, and still having similar\ncosts in running as a team, the\nfinancial costs of the incident could\nstifle the clubs ability to pay for\ntraining, transport and facility\nhire. \u201cFor a team to function at\nsuch a high level, the overheads are\nexpensive. They can probably cover\ntheir expenditure for next term, but\nin the next academic year they will\nstruggle.\u201d\nCurrently, the Imperial Medicals\nhave \u00a37,439.01 in their SGI, and\n\u00a32,724.96 in grant money. So far, the\nmoney to pay for the coach repairs\nand to cover the loss of earnings\nby the coach company (it was off\nthe road for seven days) has been\ndeducted from their funds, but the\n\u00a35,000 offered up as a \u201cgesture\u201d\nby the team captain has yet to be\ndeducted.\nFines for having to skip BUCS\nmatches come to around \u00a3600, which\nthey are yet to pay, and the loss of an\nexpected \u00a32000 from the Christmas\nBop means that financially the club\nwill be nearing the ends of their\nfunds very soon. Over the past seven\nyears, ICURFC had an income of\naround \u00a345,000 from sponsorship\nalone, whilst the Medical team\nonly acquired around \u00a33,000. Said\nDariush, \u201cPeople just don\u2019t want to\nsponsor students who will end up\nworking for the NHS. There is no\nincentive there for them to do so, so\nthey struggle to acquire funds.\u201d\nDariush concluded: \u201cICSMSU will\ndo anything to ensure the Medicals\ncan continue functioning, like they\nICSMSU would do for any club facing\nunprecedented financial issues.\nHowever in reality for the club to\ncontinue it will be a struggle.\u201d\nGEORGE CROSS\nICMRFC CLUB CAPTAIN\nTOM WHEELER\nICU PRESIDENT\nGeorge Cross gives his side of the story\nThe Union President responds...\n\n"

Dr Robin CarhartHarris of Imperial College University\nis one of a few scientists on the pursuit\nto bring a more scientific approach\nto modern psychedelic research and\nhas found evidence to indicate that\npsychedelics are more than just a\nfaded hippie emblem.\nI met up with him in his offices in\nHammersmith and discussed, among\nother things, the rise and fall of LSD\nin the scientific and public domain,\ntheories behind hallucinations, near-death experiences and his research in\nusing LSD to understand the inner\nworkings of the mind.\nLSD DISCOVERY\nTo fully understand where science\nis today we must take a brief look it\u2019s\npast. The discovery of LSD\u2019s unique\neffects arose accidently by Albert\nHofmann during the 1930s.\nThen a 37 year old medicinal\nchemist at the pharmaceutical\ncompany Sandoz in Basel, Hofmann\nbegan isolating active components of\nmedicinal plants, one of which was\nergot - a parasitic fungus that grows\nin rye and used back then to reduce\nmaternal bleeding during childbirth.\nDuring this pursuit in April 1943,\nhe inadvertently exposed himself to\nLSD, an ergotamine derivative, and\ncame home one day to find himself\ntripping balls, or as he puts it: \u201cI\nperceived an uninterrupted stream\nof fantastic pictures, extraordinary\nshapes with intense kaleidoscopic play\nof colours.\u201d\nCONTROVERSY\nSoon after this quirky discovery,\nfurther scientific research established\nthat LSD could lower ego defences\nand potentially allow access to the\nunconscious mind, revealing it as a\npotential tool to use in conjunction\nwith psychotherapy treatments.\nBetween the 1950s and mid-1960s\nover 1,000 clinical papers and several\ndozen books were published alongside\nsix international conferences on LSDassisted psychotherapy. However,\nwhat Hofmann could never have\nforetold was the progression of LSD\nfrom medical remedy to recreational\ndrug.\nWhen, after more than ten years\nof uninterrupted scientific research,\nthe drug began to take on a more\npublic profile as sensationalist\nnewspaper reports on LSD\u2019s curious\neffects opened the doors to public\nexperimentation.\nOne figure that spearheaded this\ntransition was Dr Timothy Leary,\na known apostle of LSD, who held\na vision that progressively diverted\nfrom scientific research and moved\ntowards the dangerous game of social\nand psychological revolution.\nPeople began taking LSD for\npleasure and popularity of the drug\ngrew almost synonymously with the\nhippie movement, taken as a way to\nget in touch with the self, other people\nand the environment, or to quote\nLeary: \u201cTurn on, tune in, drop out.\u201d\nIn 1966, due to bad publicity and\npolitical concerns, the authorities\ntook direct action against LSD and\nmade it illegal in the United States.\nWhat shortly followed was the\nimplementation of the UK Misuse\nof Drugs Act in 1973, classing LSD\nunder Schedule I, which by definition\nassumes it has little or no therapeutic\nvalue.\nSUGGESTIBILITY\nSince then, the story has stayed\nmuch the same and drug policies\nmore or less haven\u2019t changed\nsince the 1970s. In the Centre\nfor Neuropsychopharmacology\nat Imperial College, however, Dr\nRobin Carhart-Harris is pioneering\ninvestigations into LSD with results\nthat suggest a change is long overdue\nas current drug laws suffocate the\nprogression of neuroscience research.\nBy piling up strong evidence-based\nscientific knowledge on LSD\u2019s\neffects on the brain, Carhart-Harris\nis bringing a refreshingly scientific\napproach to this weird and wonderful\ndrug.\nWith a background in psychology\nand psychoanalysis at Bournemouth\nUniversity, Carhart-Harris\nlater moved to the University\nof Bristol to continue a PhD in\npsychopharmacology and is now a\nresearch associate at Imperial College\u2019s\nHammersmith campus, where I found\nhim one fresh October morning.\nWith an infectious enthusiasm for\nhis work and a clear, careful way of\nspeaking, Carhart-Harris describes\nhis progression from psychology to\npsychedelic research when, during his\nundergraduate years, his studies failed\nto satisfy his deep curiosity in wanting\nto understand the human condition.\n\u201c[Psychoanalysis] doesn\u2019t have much\ngrounding in a scientific approach\u2026 it\nwas more going around the edges and\nnot getting to the core of what is really\ninteresting and juicy,\u201d he explains.\nWhat truly changed the game,\nhowever, was his discovery of the book\n\u2018Realms of the Human Unconsciousness:\nObservations from LSD Research\u2019 by\nCzech psychiatrist, Stanislav Grof,\nwho worked on LSD in the 60s and\n70s. \u201cI read it in a day, was blown\naway and then thought this is really\nwhat I want to do, understand LSD in\nthe mind and put some real meat on\npsychoanalysis,\u201d he says.\nCarhart-Harris\u2019 research uses\nLSD as a way to manipulate\nthe mind and understand what\nDr Robin Carhart-Harris is bringing LSD research back to the 21\nAmerican counterculture against the Vietnam war\nPhoto: Robert Altman\n\n"

    "content": "28 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n28.11.2014\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA Reimagination of Biblical Size\n\"It's a\ngood idea\nwith truly\ndisastrous\nresults\"\nTwo huge, historically successful\ninstitutions which have\nrecently lost their appeal,\ntheir relevance and many of their\ndedicated followers: Opera and\nChristianity. What better way to\nshow the reviving powers of art than\nto create an exciting, contemporary\nopera about the Passion of Christ? As\npretty much everything in this new\npiece by John Adams, it\u2019s a good idea\nwith truly disastrous results.\nThe Gospel according to the\nother Mary, which the composer\ndescribes as a \u201cPassion oratorio\u201d,\nis a companion piece to his much\nacclaimed piece El Nino, about the\nbirth of Jesus. It aims to tell the other\ncentral Christian story, the Passion\nof Christ, though even this simple\nconcept is not necessarily obvious\nfrom the staging of the production.\nIn an attempt to score triple brownie\npoints (contemporary opera,\ncontemporary take on Christianity\nand awareness of social injustice and\ngender issues) the opera is recounted\nfrom the point of view of the women\nwho partook in Jesus\u2019 life: Mary\nMagdalene, her sister Martha and\nthe downtrodden, disenfranchised\nand exploited women who made up\nthe core of his early followers. Mary\nMagdalene is initially a promising\ncharacter; jailed for political protest,\nabused and mistreated in her past,\nshe is an unstable, self-harming and\nmystical character, embodying the\nambiguous sensuous-spiritual love for\nChrist that the traditional redeemed-prostitute view of her hints at. After\na few hopeful scenes however she\nseems to just drift around pointlessly,\nleaving the leading role to secondary\ncharacters. This is a real shame,\nas the reinterpretation of Mary in\nthis modern key is one of the most\noriginal ideas of this derivative and\nrepetitive production.\nThe opera is split in two acts, each\nof which recounts key stories from\nthe Passion. The staging is modern\nbut so sparse and inconsistent that it\nis hard to place. We\u2019re told that Mary\nhas been to prison, in which her cell\nmate was a drug addict going cold\nturkey and that Martha runs a hostel\nfor homeless women, setting the\nscene for a tough urban setting. Most\nof the large choral scenes, showing\nlarge dissatisfied rebellious crowds,\nare sung in Spanish, evoking scenes of\n20th\nCentury workers protest in South\nAmerica. Above it all floats a moving\ncloth with painted images of the\nprostate body of Christ. It is doubtful\nwhether Peter Sellars, the director,\nhad a clear idea of what he wanted\nthe stage to look like, but if he did, he\ncertainly did not get round to telling\nanyone else.\nThe interesting idea in the opera\nis the recounting of Biblical stories\nthrough the eyes of women. To\ndo this Sellars, who also wrote the\nlibretto, took female-friendly (or at\nleast neutral) texts from both the\nOld and the New testament, bulking\nthem out with an interesting array\nof 20th\ncentury poetry and texts\nfrom Saint Hildegard of Bingen (a\n12th\ncentury mystic). These create\nexcellent juxtapositions, taking\nthe edge off the preachy-ness by\nintegrating well known biblical\nphrases with emotionally charged,\ngraphic language. Regrettably, the\nlibretto does not shine as it should,\ndespite the very competent soloists.\nThe dramatic text and rousing\n(though long winded) music don\u2019t\ndo enough to lift the drab stage and\npassive cast. The opera is trying to\ntell us that the motives and problems\nthat motivated Jesus and his early\nfollowers are as pressing and relevant\ntoday as they were then, but how can\nwe believe it when the cast display so\nlittle involvement and commitment?\nTheir passivity is slightly mitigated\nby four \u201cdancer\u201d figures, who animate\nthe characters like shadows. Most\nof the time they\u2019re an annoyance,\nand further confuse the story as\nthey are not fixed to their character,\nflitting from one to the other as\nprops in a school play. The one\nglorious exception to this (almost the\nredeeming feature of this production)\nis Banks, an astonishing flex-dancer\nwho represents the moods of each\nscene. The second act is completely\ntaken over by him, as he is the only\nalive, vibrant and interesting thing\nleft in the performance. Certainly his\npresence is a bit odd, and definitely\ndistracting from the story, but his\nperformance is so extraordinary\ncompared to the flat, lifeless and\nconvoluted production that his\npresence is defiantly a relief.\nIt\u2019s a shame to have picked up so\nmany promising ideas and to have\nruined every one of them- John\nAdams and Peter Sellars would have\ndone well to take tips from Andrew\nLloyd Webber and Tim Rice about\nhow to make an edgy contemporary\nopera about Jesus- the Gospel\nAccording to the Other Mary has\nnone of the snappy popularity of\nJesus Christ Superstar, none of the\nintimate spirituality if faith and\nnothing that could keep the audience\nin their seats past the interval.\nThe Gospel According to the Other\nMary runs at the ENO\u2019s Coliseum until\n5th December. Tickets available from \u00a35.\nEditorial: The\nTransformation\nIssue\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nThe Western Canon.For some,it is\nthe creme-de-la-creme of artistic\nexpression; a source of extreme\nbeauty,and due recognition for a\nnumber of writers.For others it is\nan outdated concept,one that reeks\nof Western imperialism,racism,\nand misogyny.But what happens\nwhen you want to reinterpret a\nclassic work? In this issue of Felix,\nwe are looking at how classics are\ntransformed by contemporary\nartists.\nWe start off with the ENO,who\nare taking on possibly the most\nwell known piece of art in the\nentire world: The Holy Bible.In The\nGospelAccordingtotheOtherMary,\nJohn Adams has scored a dramatic\nretelling of the story of Jesus.\nClara Novela Clark delves into this\nopera,and lets us know whether it\nis a biblical success,or just an epic\nfailure.\nElsewhere,Jeff James takes on a\nnew reimagining of Sophocles\u2019\nancient drama Philoctetes; through\ncareful adaptation and radical\ndirection,James has transposed the\nplay into the modern age,turning\nit into a treacle-soaked production\n-StinkFoot.Peter Sarvari heads\ndown to The Yard Theatre to give\nhis judgement on the play,while we\nsit down for a chat with the director\nto ind out the challenges of taking\non a classic.\nPeter Sarvari also heads down to\nThe Barbican Centre to check out\nHowietheRookie, a dive into the\nalcohol-soaked realm of Dublin\u2019s\ncriminal underworld,bringing with\nit ierce lyricism and manic energy.\nThe lack of multiculturalism in\nthe Western canon is taken on by\nIndira Malik,who utterly destroys\nthe idea that medieval art features\nonly Caucasian people.Taking on\na whole range of examples,from\nBlack Madonnas to Hieronymus\nBosch,she explores how black and\nAsian people have largely been\nwritten out of this art history.\nFinally,Kieran Ryan challenges\nthe idea that the impossible\nis unobtainable.Taking an\ninspirational quote from author\nNeil Gaiman as a starting point,he\ngives some examples of artists who\nhave achieved the impossible,and\nin the process transformed the art\nworld around them.One such artist\nis Llew Watkins,who will be giving\na talk at Imperial next Wednesday.\nSo that\u2019s it for this week\u2019s issue;\nhopefully we should have showed\nyou that it is possible for art to\ntransform not only your view of\nclassic works,but the whole world\ntoo.\nClara Clark Nevola takes on the ENO\u2019s gospel interpretation\nJohn Adams' The Gospel According To The Other Mary at the London Coliseum Photo courtesy of the ENO\n\"It's a\nshame\nto have\npicked up\nso many\npromising\nideas and\nto have\nruined\nevery one\nof them\"\n\n"

Ed.].\nThis cumbersome piece of brass\nwas taken from the CGCU office last\nFriday morning by a member of the\nRoyal School of Mines Union (RSMU)\ncommittee, despite a member of the\nCGCU committee also being present.\nThe RSM student, a member\nof \u201cSkinner\u2019s Bottom\u201d (The RSM\nmascotry team) visited the office\nto return another mascot and a\ntankard that was stolen from CGCU\non Thursday evening during the TriUnion Bar Night. According to CGCU\nPresident, stealing mascots during\nthe night was off limits \u201cso that they\ncould meet for a play-date.\u201d Felix\nremains uncertain as to what this\nactually means but was not inclined\nto investigate.\nAfter being granted access to the\noffice by security, the student went to\nreturn the mascots, but was greeted\nby the CGCU Media and Marketing\nOfficer (MMO), seemingly fresh-faced\nafter the previous night.\nThe MMO did not recognise when\nthe RSM student lumbered the\nlarge, overbearing piece of hardware\ninto his Mary Poppins-esque sports\nbag, then left, Spanner in tow. Said\nthe MMO \u201cI thought the spanner\nwas already in the secret mascot\nstronghold safe from the slimy hands\nof RSMU.\u201d\nFelix spoke to Ben Warnick, who\ngave us a hilarious recount of what\nhappened. Said Warnick, \u201cAs soon\nas the CGCU\u2019s officer\u2019s attention\nstrayed, the spanner was hidden\ndeftly in a hockey bag and the Miner\nbeat a hasty retreat.\n\u201cThe weight of the spanner in the\nbag was not insignificant, sufficiently\nso that the Guildswoman commented\nPhilippa Skett reports on the loss\nof CGCU\u2019s mascot\nWhy is he wearing a cloak? Photo: Facebook\nDear Guildsmen,\nIt is with great shame and sadness that I must write this apology.For apologies I must for\nthe loss of our dearest,most spanneriest mascot,the Spanner.\nUnbeknownst to the CGCU Exec,most of whom spent the morning in question\nrecovering from the Tri-Union Bar Night,the cunning President of the RSMU had hatched a\ndastardly plan to robe us of our most scared of artefacts.\nHaving somehow gained access to the CGCU Ofice he was able to search unabated\nfor Spanner.Until,that was,he was walked in on by our Media and Marketing Oficer.To\nher shame she did not recognise the violation that was occurring in front of her or the\nincredibly heavy bag he walked out with.She believed all too easily the story he told about\nreturning poor violated Bolt and did not recognise the flattery he bestowed upon our ofice\nas the distracting lies they were.\nBut what chance did she have when up against such an astute,calculating individual\nas the leader of the great RSMU.What chance would any mere real engineer have when\nconfronted by the wit and skill of those who study the rocks.It is itting that we take this\ntotal defeat valiantly and it is right that we congratulate the RSMU on their patience,their\nadeptness and their determination.\nAnd now lonely Spanner,so far from home,faces the indignity of having to appear\nnext to the so much more impressive,shinning ediice of Davy and our union faces the\nhumiliation of being so clearly bettered by the RSMU.\nSo I apologise to you all for the loss of our mascot and the shame brought upon our\nUnion by it.I ask you for your forgiveness and promise that this will only make us more\ndedicated that one day the CGCU will reach the dizzying heights of success of the RSMU.\nTIM MUNDAY\nCGCU President\nThe letter of Apology\nupon the weight of bag. Despite\nbeing a hair from discovering the\nintercollegiate espionage occurring\nunder her nose, the miner managed\nto escape with the spanner much to\nthe embarrassment of the CGCU\nMascot Bearers.\u201d\nPhotos later surfaced of two\nmembers of Skinner\u2019s Bottom \u2013 one\nwearing what appears to be a fresher\u2019s\npub crawl t-shirt as a bandana \u2013\nbrandishing the large spanner in\nfront of the RSMU office. Both are\nwearing top hats, and one also appears\nto be in some sort of cloak, although\nit is unclear if the outfits are integral\nto the mascotry stealing, as one would\nassume a cloak would only hinder the\nmovement of a large metal spanner.\nRSMU then issued a ransom to the\nCGCU, asking for \u00a3250 to be donated\nto RAG, for evidence of Spanner\nworking on the bolts of Tower Bridge\nfor which it is allegedly designed to\ndo, for the president and Spanner\nbearer to do yards of alcohol and\nCGCU to write a grovelling letter of\napology.\nFelix has kindly printed the letter,\nmostly because we find it hilarious,\nsatisfying one of the four ransom\nnote demands. Since the Tower\nBridge walkway is closed after a\ndropped beer bottle smashed its\nnew glass walkway, it is uncertain if\nstudents will be allowed up wielding\na heavy piece of weaponry to attempt\nto unscrew any fixtures, but at time of\npress a spokesperson of Tower Bridge\ndeclined to comment.\nFelix has every faith in Tim\nMunday, CGCU President, that he\ncan indeed down a yard, and wish him\nevery success in his endeavour.\n\"one would\nassume\na cloak\nwould only\nhinder the\nmovement\nof a large\nmetal\nspanner.\"\n... why am\nI reporting\non a\nfucking\nspanner?\nEd.\n\n"

She took about 150\nphotos and all were blurry as I kept slipping and sliding about on the ice. She posted them all and then tagged me, and Mum liked some of them, then started to ask me about Dorothy\nduring our Saturday night Skype call. She wants me to bring her over for the weekend. MY BEDSHEETS ARE EVEN MORE EMBARRASSING AT HOME GOD NO\nSunday 23rd\nDorothy knocked on my door super early this morning, asking if I wanted to go for a walk in Hyde Park. I was planning on having a lie-in (I was up quite late on reddit) but she\npretended to go in this sort of childish strop until I said I would.\nShe still won\u2019t sleep with me, she says if I love her I will wait until \u201cshe\u2019s ready.\u201d That\u2019s \ufb01ne (obviously, I am a feminist after all) but when did we start telling each other we loved each\nother? This is meant to be a big point in a relationship, and we have been only going out like a week? Need to Skype Mum about this.\nMonday 24th\nReceived 55 whatsapp messages from Dorothy. Many consisted of just strings of emojis, some of which I didn\u2019t even recognise or even know what she was trying to say by using them.\nDating is hard.\nReceived a letter from Kris Kraye in jail in Turkmenistan, and he is coming home next weekend! They dropped all the charges and apparently he had started an underground gambling\ncircle with some of the cellmates, and he\u2019s a liability or something but it doesn\u2019t matter, he is coming home! I am going to meet him at the airport, and Dorothy really wants to come along\ntoo.\nTuesday 25th\nI spent the afternoon off in the library. I went to the fourth \ufb02oor (where all the fresher\u2019s study obviously, I am not ready for the imposing silence of the second \ufb02oor yet). It is so warm!\nEven though it is November people are walking around in shorts and t-shirts, and at one point I swear I saw someone literally tackle another person for trying to move their desk fan.\nWednesday 26th\nI told Dorothy that I was going to the ACC Bar night next week (as a geek lol so I can just wear 3D glasses from that cinema trip in freshers week) and she got super upset before\nI had even had a chance to ask her to come with me.\nI don\u2019t understand this woman .\nHANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The shadows on the wall\nreflect the play on the stage. An\ninnovative performance, such that\nyou have never seen before, at student\nfriendly prices. A must-see.\nStink Foot is a new adaptation of\nSophocles\u2019 Greek tragedy Philoctetes;\nPhiloctetes\u2019 foot is not stinking, but\nsmells like sweet treacle, Odysseus\nis a female, and Noptolemus, the\nson of Achilles, is overly straight.\nPhiloctetes has a magic bow, a reward\nfor saving Hercules\u2019 life, but was\nabandoned on a desert island by\nOdysseus, simply because no one in\nGreece could bear the smell of his\npoisoned foot. But now the Greeks\nneed to use of the bow in the long\nongoing Trojan War.\nWhen I set foot in the Yard Theatre\nand walked across the stage \u2013 built\nfrom recycled materials \u2013 to find\nmy seat, I knew I was going to see\nsomething unusual. But it is perhaps\nmore accurate to say that there\nwas no stage at all, with the actors\nperforming right in front of, and\nsometimes behind us. I felt that what\nI would see would be really involving\nand lively, but the cast exceeded my\nwildest expectations.\nThe story may not be long and\ncomplicated, but it can be interpreted\nin a myriad of ways. It shows us\ntwo entirely different characters,\nemploying two different kinds of\npersuasion, allowing us to see the\nresult of each.\nIt is like good cop versus bad cop,\none being kind and empathetic, the\nother authoritarian, while giving\nus an insight into the ruthless and\nselfish nature of humanity. Even\nwithout any interpretation the story\nwas easy to follow; despite the rather\nsimplistic plot our attention was\nmaintained due lively dialogues,\nbrilliant acting, and director Jeff\nJames\u2019 innovative means of depiction:\ndisplaying pain with harsh noise,\nhaving Philoctetes\u2019 foot ooze golden\nsyrup, using a DJ mixer to convey\ndivine messages \u2013 these are all ways\nto bring the audience closer to the\nperformance.\nPerhaps I wouldn\u2019t recommend\nthis play for those who are expecting\na full, epic story, or all night\nentertainment, given its snappy\n70 minute run-time. But for those\nwho enjoy watching well developed,\nfleshed-out characters, appreciate\nexcellent lighting and sound design,\nand are interested in the director\u2019s\npanache, then I couldn\u2019t recommend\nStink Foot highly enough. Theatre\nhas never felt so alive!\n\"... giving\nus an\ninsight\ninto the\nruthless\nand selfish\nnature of\nhumanity\"\n\"Theatre\nhas never\nfelt so\nalive!\"\nPETER SARVARI\nARTS WRITER\nFred Fyles chats with Jeff James about theatre, traditions, and treacle\nStink Foot by Jeff James. Daniel Millar (Philoctetes) and Joshua Miles (Neo). Photo: Bronwen Sharp\nTaking on the Classics: A Director\u2019s How-To Guide\nHow do you go about\nreinventing the wheel? This\nwas the question facing Jeff\nJames when he decided to take on\nSophocles\u2019 classic piece of drama\nPhiloctetes; directing and writing\nthe adaptation himself, James has\nshaped the play into something\nnew, renaming it Stink Foot after\nPhiloctetes\u2019 main feature: his rotting,\nstinking foot. It was this foot that\nled to him being abandoned on the\nisland of Lemnos for ten years, until\nit is prophesied that he is needed\nback in Troy in order for the Greeks\nto win the war; it is up to young\nNeoptolemus to convince him to\nreturn, using every ounce of skill\nand cunning in his mind. It\u2019s a heavy\nmantle to take on, and so we sat\ndown with James for a chat about the\nchallenges of adapting Greek drama,\nthe relevance of the play to modern\nlife, and the dangers of using gallons\nof treacle on stage.\nSo firstly, when did James become\naware of the play? \u2018I\u2019d read Sophocles\nat university, and thought that this\nplay was very interesting, funny, and\nprofound \u2013 I kept coming back to\nit, but thought it was too difficult\u2019,\nsays James; eventually it was a friend\nwho pushed him to produce the\nplay, saying \u2018if that\u2019s the play that\u2019s\nobsessing you, then you should go\nfor it\u2019. And taking on Sophocles as\nhis first adaptation, was that always\nthe plan? \u201cNo, initially I didn\u2019t know\nI would write it,\u201d admits James, \u201cbut\nthere were things that I could feel\nin the play, and wanted to express\u201d.\nAfter a period of deliberation \u2013 \u201cone\nscenario was to employ a writer, and\nadapt it in collaboration\u201d \u2013 James\nultimately felt that by writing the\nadaptation himself it would be \u201ceasier\nto get these ideas across\u201d.\nLuckily he wasn\u2019t alone in the\nendeavour; he has enlisted the help of\ndesigner Alex Lowde, with whom he\nworked in a Young Vic workshop the\nprevious year. Together they came\nup with an ingenious staging device:\ntreacle. 250 kg of the stuff, which\noozes out of the sores on Philoctetes\u2019\nleg, eventually covering the pristine\nstage. \u201cThe treacle idea actually\ncame really early on in the process\u201d,\nsays James, \u201ca nasty black pool is\nan interesting way of representing\nPhiloctetes\u2019 foot, which is supposed\nto be the most horrible foot in the\nworld.\u201d But the treacle takes on a\nmore symbolic role too: \u201cthe play is\nabout morality; Neo is employed to\ntrick Philoctetes, who is essentially a\nlonely disabled man. He starts off by\nsaying that he isn\u2019t the kind of person\nto trick people, but it\u2019s a question of\nethical compromise\u201d. As James puts\nit succinctly: \u201cin the end everyone is\njust lost in this shit\u201d.\nLike many things in the theatre\n(pyrotechnics, children, live animals),\nworking with treacle can pose a\nunique set of challenges for the\nactors. These can be both physical \u2013\n\u2018the actors would slip everywhere...\nthe treacle pulled out body hair\u2019 \u2013 and\nmental \u2013 James mentions that \u201cit\nwas interesting to see how a person\u2019s\nacting style can change as they\nbecome covered with the treacle.\u201d The\npresence of the treacle means that it\u2019s\na fine balance (literally) between the\nactor\u2019s intentions and their physical\nlimitations.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time James\nhas turned his attention to classic\ntheatre, having previously directed\nplays by Anton Chekhov and Harold\nPinter, but he admits that he is \u201ca bit\nbewildered by the distinction between\nnew writing and classic texts in the\nBritish theatre industry\u201d. He follows\nthe maxim of George Devine, one\nof the founders of the Royal Court\u2019s\nresident company, who said \u201ctreat\nnew plays like classics, and classics\nlike new plays\u201d, but admits that it\ncan sometimes be easier to access the\nclassic texts: \u201cthese classic plays exist,\nand it is easier to access them than\nto access the very best new writing,\nwhich often goes straight to the Royal\nCourt\u201d.\nBut are these plays still relevant to\nthe modern age? \u201cYeah, I think these\nclassic plays still explore modern\nideas\u201d, says James, who explored the\nlink between Sophocles and urban\nlife in his article The Desert Island\nand the City. \u201cThe desert island\nnever becomes a home \u2013 even after\nyears there, the castaway still wants\nto return home\u201d, he writes, \u201cwe are\nunable to get used to the strangeness\nof living alongside so many other\npeople, but the only thing worse\nwould be to live alone\u201d. Alongside\nthis theme of alienation and ethical\ncompromise, the play also explores\n\u201cthe difficulty of having a body;\nthe materiality of it\u201d, as expressed\nthrough the ever-present, stinking\nfoot of Philoctetes.\nIt can be difficult to adapt any\nclassic text, and James is aware of the\npossible pitfalls: \u201cwhen you adapt\nwell known texts people can get quite\nupset if they come to see it and don\u2019t\nrecognise the play exactly as they\nknow it\u201d. But taking on Sophocles\ncomes with its own challenges:\n\u201cthe form of the play is so strange\u201d,\nexplains James, \u201cSophocles had so\nmany radical ideas about the theatre,\nand it\u2019s so exciting that he engages\nwith the form at that level... but every\nother line in the play is a reference\nto a classic story or figure, the kind\nthat would be relevant to Greek\naudiences\u201d.\nSo what is his solution to this\nproblem, which can lead to the \u2018play\nresisting you\u2019? \u201cI tried to cut out all\nthe references\u201d, says James, \u201cexcept\nthe ones where we could show the\naudience exactly what we meant\u201d.\nUltimately any form of adaptation\nis daunting, and James has set his\nsights high by starting with one of\nthe founding fathers of the theatre,\nbut during our conversation his\nenergy and passion for the project\nis evident. Does he hope that this\nwill encourage a new generation to\nexplore Greek theatre? Perhaps. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot a question of accessibility, more\nabout communicating the things\nthat I really want to get across. But if\npeople get into Sophocles because of\nthis, that would be amazing.\u201d\nStink Foot runs at The Yard Theatre\nuntil 2nd\nDecember. Tickets are \u00a312.50\nadults, \u00a310.00 concessions\n\n"

    "content": "24 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n28.11.2014\nFilm\nilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park & Jack Steadman\nAlthough Jack Steadman probably isn\u2019t the hardest working man in Felix\nThe hardest working man in show business\nGet On Up\nDirector: Tate Taylor\nScreenplay: Jez Butterworth,\nJohn-Henry Butterworth\nCast: Chadwick Boseman,\nNelson Ellis, Viola Davis,\nOctavia Spencer\nBiopics have a weird status in the\nfilm industry. Most struggle\nto assemble some form of\nnarrative arc around the messy lives\nof the famous, but some \u2013 and only\nsome \u2013 transcend that to become\nsomething greater.\nJust occasionally, a film like Tim\nBurton\u2019s Ed Wood or Spike Lee\u2019s\nMalcolm X comes along, proving that\nreally can be something more to\nbiographical films than just \u2018re-telling\nthe story\u2019. Faced with the life of James\nBrown, one of the most influential,\nif not the most influential, figures\nin music, Get On Up has high\nexpectations saddled on it from the\nstart.\nAnd damn, if it doesn\u2019t deliver on\nthem straight away. The opening\nis riddled with an infectious\nmomentum, picking out two\nmoments in Brown\u2019s life before the\ninevitable jump back to the early\ndays. An elderly, borderline delirious\nBrown threatens some conference-types with a shotgun for the crime\nof using his toilet, and a younger,\nsuccessful Brown berates a pilot\nunder fire in Vietnam, insisting that\nthey make it to their gig for the army\ndespite the explosions rattling the\ncraft. Two very different moments,\ntwo very different snapshots of\nBrown. But immediately, two things\nare clear.\nFirst: This is Chadwick Boseman\u2019s\nfinest hour so far. He is utterly\nconsumed by the role, as magnetic\na screen presence as you\u2019d expect\n\u2013 as you\u2019d demand \u2013 from James\nBrown, and if this doesn\u2019t prove to\nbe the (potentially Oscar-nominated)\nbreakout role that launches him\ninto the acting big leagues, I\u2019ll be\ninvesting in an edible hat. The recent\nannouncement of his casting as Black\nPanther in Captain America: Civil War\nand Black Panther\u2019s own solo film\nprobably means I won\u2019t need to worry\ntoo much about that hat, but just in\ncase.\nSecondly: The Help director Tate\nTaylor is having an absolute blast\nhere. Working off a screenplay from\nJez and John-Henry Butterworth\n(the duo behind the summer\u2019s most\nunderrated piece of genius, Edge of\nTomorrow), his scattershot approach\nto chronology can sometimes make\nthings a little jarring \u2013 following\nthose first two scenes, the film ends\nup with whiplash from jumping back\nto the beginning, at which point it\nstarts to meanderingly tell the story\nin vaguely chronological order,\nreplete with the occasional scene from\na completely different point in time.\nBut there\u2019s a sense of fun pervading\nit all that makes you want to let the\nfilm off the hook \u2013 and besides,\ntelling the story straight would be\nfar too obvious for a film about a\nman who defied the obvious. That\nsubversive nature slips through in\nBrown\u2019s winks and nods to camera,\nculminating in one point with his\nwalking out of a scene while talking\nto Dan Aykroyd\u2019s manager, instead\nopting to continue the argument with\nthe camera.\nThe most extreme example of its\nkind, that little diversion manages to\novercome its oddities to help cement\nthe concept of this being Brown\u2019s\nstory from Brown\u2019s perspective, a\ntale \u2013 a legend \u2013 that he is spinning\nthe audience, even if that occasionally\nmeans letting him off the hook\nsomewhat for his less endearing\nactivities.\nThe fact this review has mostly\ncentred around the lead actor and the\ndirector is a reasonable reflection of\nthe impression the film gives off \u2013 the\nsupporting cast all put in excellent\nturns, with no noticeably flawed\nperformances beyond the occasional\n\u2018man with one line\u2019 being a bit dull,\nand the music inescapably glorious,\nis, obviously, but it all keeps coming\nback to Brown, and Boseman\u2019s electric\nperformance. Looking anywhere else\nor noticing anyone else, is tricky.\nEven in those moments where\nBrown is being borderline malicious,\nsociopathic even, it\u2019s still him you end\nup rooting for.\nGet On Up is a clever piece of\nfilm-making, an alluring cocktail\nof snapshots from a true industry\nlegend, all bound together by\nBoseman. Despite the time-jump-whiplash, there\u2019s an undeniable sense\nof momentum, and an infectious joy\nthat spreads throughout \u2013 making the\nmoments where the film pulls the rug\nfrom under you all the more painful.\nIt may not be to everyone\u2019s taste,\nand it may be a tad too long, but Get\nOn Up grabs your attention and keeps\nit for its entire 139-minute running\ntime. Which is, whichever way you\nlook at it, a pretty damn respectable\nachievement.\nSecond time\u2019s not that much of a charm\nJACK STEADMAN\nSECTION EDITOR\nThis year has been an interesting\nyear for comedy. We\u2019ve\nhad the hilarious-but-not-strictly-a-comedy Grand Budapest\nHotel and Guardians of the Galaxy\n(amongst many, many others), a glut\nof resoundingly mediocre entries\n(looking at you, Last Vegas), a few\npieces of questionably quality, and\nlastly the prime example in how to\nproperly do an American comedy\nsequel in 22 Jump Street.\nThe Jump Street sequel was an\nexercise in knowing what made\nthe first film so entertaining, and\nrespecting that while also making\nefforts to carve out new ground. It\u2019s\na high benchmark for comparison,\nwhich makes it a shame that, from the\nstart, Horrible Bosses 2 wields almost\nnone of that charm.\nThis was a much more traditional\nsequel, one which adhered to the\nspirit of the original (albeit with a\nnew director) without straying too\nfar from its comfort zone. A few\ngenuine laughs aside, the majority\nof the humour fell into the standard\ntrap of aiming to be offensively\namusing, and simply turning out to\nbe smirk-worthy. The saving grace\ncame from the natural talent of the\ncast, who are genuinely funny people.\nThe film seemed mostly content to let\nBateman, Sudeikis and Day bounce\noff one another, leading to several\nscenes that simply drag on too long\nwith unfunny riffs on various themes,\nwith the occasional flash of genius.\nThe fact that the out-takes, played\nover the credits, provide the highest\nlaugh rate per minute speaks volumes\nabout the talent of the cast \u2013 it\u2019s just a\npity that they\u2019ve been lumbered with\na film that feels so oddly happy to\nwallow in mediocrity.\nHorrible Bosses 2 works best when\nit allows the focus to stray outside\nthe leads \u2013 as likeable as the actors\nthemselves are, their characters are\nlargely unlikeable jerks, so spending\nany real length of time with them\nquickly becomes a drag regardless of\nany jokes they come out with. Chris\nPine and Jennifer Aniston both\nsteal the show \u2013 the former bringing\na manic energy that channels his\nCaptain Kirk at his worst, the latter\nturning up the nymphomania of her\nreturning, eponymous horrible boss\nbeyond the levels of the first film.\nBoth Pine and Aniston inject the film\nwith life right when it needs it most,\nblasting away the cobwebs of the\nexcessively long scenes of bickering\nto produce something genuinely\nfunny. The same can\u2019t really be said\nfor the rest of the supporting cast\n\u2013 there aren\u2019t bad performances by\nany means, it\u2019s more a case of poorly\nHorrible Bosses 2\nDirector: Sean Anders\nScreenplay: Sean Anders, John\nMorris\nCast: Jason Bateman, Jason\nSudeikis, Charlie Day, Chris\nPine, Jennifer Aniston\nwritten characters and a total waste\nof the ridiculously talented cast, not\nleast Christoph Waltz.\nHorrible Bosses 2\u2019s cast really is its\nbiggest strength. The soundtrack\nis utterly abominable (perhaps\npredictably), pushing the \u2018popular\nmusic that\u2019s sort of relevant\nright now\u2019 button repeatedly,\nwhile the editing is lazy and the\ncinematography standard for\nAmerican comedies \u2013 a bunch of\ntalking heads, a few predictable sight\ngags, and that\u2019s your lot. There are a\nfew inspired moments \u2013 the montage\nof the trio\u2019s plan for the money\ndrop that forms the film\u2019s centre-piece is hilarious, and the editing/\ncinematography suddenly up their\ngame to match \u2013 but mostly the\nwhole thing just feels like a missed\nopportunity. It\u2019s an entertaining\nmissed opportunity, and if you have\ntwo hours in your life that you need\nto fill with a comedy on the big screen\nyou could definitely do worse, but\nin the end, Horrible Bosses 2 is just\nanother not-bad, not-great either\nsequel. It\u2019s a shame.\nUnfortunately, you don\u2019t look quite this good whilst singing karaoke\nPhoto: Tate Taylor/Universal Pictures\nPhoto: Sean Anders/Warner\n\n"

Photo: Shutterstock\nHaving Trouble Sleeping?\nUtsav Radia reports on Imperial\u2019s research into getting a good nights sleep\nFirst baby has been born after womb transplant\n\"Previously\nsleep was\nthought to\nbe a very\npassive\nstate.\"\nIn the UK, 1 in 4 people suffer\nfrom some form of sleep disorder\nresulting in excessive daytime\nsleepiness. Researchers at Imperial\nCollege London, led by Professors\nWilliam Wisden and Nicholas Franks\nof the Department of Life Sciences\nand Dr Mick Hastings\u2019 group at\nthe MRC Laboratory of Molecular\nBiology in Cambridge, have shined\nnew light on exactly how the body\ncontrols when you wake up and when\nyou fall asleep (the circadian rhythm).\nThe human circadian system\nregulates the rhythm of the human\nbody by establishing normal\nsleep and wake phases. During the\ntransition from wakefulness to\nsleep, the brain gradually becomes\nless responsive to visual, auditory\nand other environmental stimuli\nand relatively more responsive to\ninternal stimuli. We now understand\nthis transition better in terms of\nthe stages of sleep \u2013 stage I being\nthe most superficial and stage IV\nrequiring the most stimulation to\nwake an individual; REM (rapid eye\nmovement) sleep is either considered\nseparately or as stage V sleep.\nPreviously, sleep was thought\nto be a very passive state of\nunconsciousness with decreased body\n(especially brain) activity. Nowadays\nwe know that sleep serves a variety\nof functions: from restoration and\nrecovery, to energy conservation,\nmetabolic replenishment of the brain\nand even memory!\nA \u2018master clock\u2019 found in\nthe hypothalamus called the\nsuprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is\nbelieved to be centrally involved\nin synchronising many other \u2018local\nclocks\u2019 that collectively modulate\nour body\u2019s state of activity. However,\nuntil now, we were not able to\ndemonstrate the effects of these \u2018local\nclocks\u2019 in the brain or explain the\nmechanisms by which they influence\nvarious areas.\nIn this experimental study on mice,\nthe contribution of one putative\n\u2018local clock\u2019 in histaminergic neurons\nin the tuberomamillary nucleus\n(TMN; lies outside the SCN) to the\nregulation of the sleep-wake cycle was\ntested. The underlying hypothesis\nof this study was that histaminergic\nneurones in the hypothalamus are\nsilent during sleep (i.e. they release\nno histamine) and only start firing\nafter the onset of wakefulness. The\nsubsequently released histamine,\nmade by the enzyme histidine\ndecarboxylase (HDC), enhances\nwakefulness by acting on areas of the\ncerebral cortex.\nThe scientists selectively deleted a\nwell known \u2018clock gene\u2019 called Bmal1\nfrom histaminergic cells in mice and\nfound that this led to higher levels of\nHDC expression and subsequently\nhigher brain histamine levels\nduring the day. As a result of this,\nthe test mice had more fragmented\nand shallower sleep, prolonged\nwakefulness, hindered recovery after\nsleep deprivation and even impaired\nmemory.\nThe researchers used\nelectroencephalography (EEG)\nanalysis to compare the levels of\nbrain activity during the sleep-wake\ncycles in control mice (i.e. those with\nthe Bmal1 gene in the TMN) with\nthose mice bred with the gene deleted\n(test mice).\nWakefulness and recovery from\nsleep was assessed by placing pieces of\npaper and plastic tubes in the mice\u2019s\nchamber to discourage sleep. It was\nfound that after 5 hours of sleep-deprivation, the control mice had an\naverage of 6 hours more sleep than\nthe test mice. Memory was assessed\nby observing the ability of the control\nand test mice to recognise two\npreviously familiarised objects after\na fixed period of sleep deprivation\nand a period of recovery. For both\ngroups of mice, sleep deprivation\nimpaired performance in recognizing\nthe objects; however, the test mice\nperformed worse and explored all the\nIn early September this year,a\n36 year old woman made history\nby giving birth to the world\u2019s\nirst womb-transplant baby.Ab-solute uterine factor infertility,\ncaused by either an abnormal\nor absent uterus,is considered\nthe only untreatable type of\nfemale infertility.It affects many\nwomen throughout the world,\nsome of whom have resorted\nto other motherhood options\nsuch as surrogacy and adoption.\nSeveral uterus transplantations\nhave previously been attempted\nbut no live births have been\nreported until recently,as part\nof a groundbreaking clinical trial\nled by Dr Matt Brannstrom of\nthe University of Gothernburg.\nIt has taken more than a decade\nof intensive animal research by the\nteam of scientists before achieving\nthis goal.\nThe Swedish woman was 15 when\nshe was told that she would never\nbear children of her own after being\ndiagnosed with Rokitansky syn-drome,a congenital absence of the\nuterus.The woman received the\nuterus from a 61-year-old family\nfriend,and after in-vitro fertilisation\n(IVF) treatment with her partner she\nunderwent a single embryo transfer\na year after the surgery.\nVincent was delivered prematurely at 31 weeks,He is normal and\nhealthy,much to the delight of his\nparents and the research team.\nBefore this case became a proof-of-concept for uterus transplantation as a treatment method for\nabsolute uterine factor infertility,\nthere were doubts as to whether a\ntransplanted uterus could provide\nnourishment to the foetus,and\nwhether a post-menopausal womb\nwowuld even work.Eight other\nwomen are currently involved in\nthe transplantation trial and the\nresearch team has recently announced that two more women are\npregnant having undergone the\nsame procedure.\nScientists have to consider the\nethical caveats that surround such\nresearch,which has been described\nas one that requires\u201cgreater ethical justiication than other organ\ntransplants\u201d.Critics have questioned\nwhether the operation would be a\nrealistic option since it only seeks to\nimprove one\u2019s quality of life rather\nthan being life-saving,yet it is\ncostly and fraught with many\nhealth risks.However,advocates\nbelieve it helps women to fulil\npersonal dreams of having a child\nand developing a maternal bond\nwhich could be missing from other\noptions,namely surrogacy.\nThis live birth has opened up\nthe possibility for treating women\nwith absolute uterine factor infertility and is a reflection of the long\nand challenging journey taken\nby Dr.Brannstrom and his team.\n\u201cI want people to know that what\nthey think is impossible can happen,\u201dsaid the new mother who\nhopes that other women will be\nencouraged and can tell the same\nstory in the future.\nKAY YI CHONG\nobjects equally.\nDr Xiao Yu of Imperial College\nLondon, lead author of the study,\nexpressed how \u201cexciting [it is] to find\nsignificant evidence of a local body\nclock. Now we know that the master\nclock is not working alone, but relies\non lots of helpers to wake up our\nwhole body\u201d.\nFurthermore, the next steps are\nto investigate if there is a direct\nlink between the SCN and other\n\u2018local clocks\u2019 to decipher how sleep-wake messages are interchanged.\nNonetheless, this study has helped\nus to establish a platform to better\nunderstand how circadian control\nmay be occurring in humans.\nHopefully, we are not far from\ntranslating this understanding\ninto tangible benefits for patients\nsuffering from sleep disorders.\nIt's a boy!

But Honest, with Truth to Tell.\nPETER SARVARI\nARTS WRITER\nHowie the Rookie is an 80\nminute single-actor play\ndirected by Mark O\u2019Hove and\nperformed by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor,\nplaying from the 19th to the 29th\nNovember in The Barbican Centre\u2019s\nPit Theatre. The piece won two prizes,\nattracted critical acclaim, and also\nwon the Irish Times Best New Play\naward. After all these fancy lines let\nme now dig deep into soul of the play\nand show what I found.\nIt all starts with that fearful\nrepetitive sound. It describes the\nmood of the night really well, the\npub and the pitiful characters, who\nhave no way out of the wood. This\nfirst sentence leads me to discuss\none word: character. Yes, but in what\nsense? Vaughan-Lawlor played one\ncharacter \u2013 Howie \u2013 and then in the\nsecond half of the play switched to\nRookie; during this, sometimes he\nplayed others, sometimes he did\nnot. But we know others existed,\nbecause he both mentions them\nwhile he was acting, and also since\nsocial interactions with other people\nwere expressed by Vaughan-Lower\u2019s\noriginal character. After this long\nand complicated diatribe, aimed at\nexplaining how one actor can give\nbirth to several ones who are playing\ndifferent characters, one is very likely\nto ask if the storyline can be followed.\nThe answer is yes; partly because of\nthe wonderful acting (more about\nthis later) and partly because of the\nstoryline, which barely exists. The\nplot the writer wants to convey is a\nmixture of short stories; situations\nbased around one guy or two. He\ndepicts a bunch of hopeless guys and\ngirls, and their way of living; it is\nsometimes funny, or eye-opening, or\ntruly sad, or even all at the same time.\nThe message the writer is putting\nacross is not within a soft shell, but\n\u2013 through the staging of the action \u2013\nbursts out in a non-fearful way.\nThat being said, the storyline and\nthe characters could be enhanced.\nThere was \u2013 I found \u2013 perhaps\ntoo much in terms of swearing\nor fighting, making it difficult to\nfind a character with whom one\ncould sympathise. But this must be\nattributed to the ruthlessness and\nthe candidness of the play and is a\nconsequence of its topic. If you want\nto see a romantic fairy tale with your\nloved one as a Christmas treat, this\nplay might be one to avoid.\nBut if you are bored with the\nmainstream theatre, and want\nsomething innovative, special and\nmodern, you have just found it here.\nThe play is definitely funny, if you\nare able to stomach its novelty; what\nmakes the story a lot more involving\nis Vaughan-Lawlor\u2019s amazing acting\n(and it wasn\u2019t just me that thought\nthis \u2013 one lady used that term at\nleast five times afterwards to express\nher admiration), the fast dance-like\nmovements, the really skilful use of\ntone, and the mysterious lightning,\nwhich combine to make the drama,\nthe action and the whole story lively\nand irresistibly involving \u2013 despite\nthe fact that there is only one man on\nthe stage. Due to Vaughan-Lower\u2019s\nstrong presence you start to feel you\nknow the characters, you grasp the\nplot and, by the end of the play, the\nstory is your own.\nHowie the Rookie runs at The\nPit Theatre at Barbican, until 29th\nNovember.

With\nthe costs incurred from the coach\ndamage, fines for missing matches\nand the loss of earnings from the\nReynolds Bop they can no longer run,\nthey may be out of action by the next\nacademic year.\nThe sanctions involved included\nbanning the whole club from\nsocialising, and also having to forfeit\nseveral key games. Those involved\nwith the incident will also have\nto take part in Union community\nservice.\nThe appeal was escalated past\nImperial College Union President\nTom Wheeler through to the chair of\nthe Union Trustee Board, Dame Julia\nHiggins, but was then rejected.\nIt was rejected on the grounds that\nthey thought the original sanctions\nto be justified enough; they had no\ndesire to modify them further and\nconsidered them an appropriate\nmeasure to stop such behaviour in the\nfuture.\nThe appeal, backed by the Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine Student\nUnion (ICSMU) President, Dariush\nHassanzadeh-Baboli, was made via\nemail on the 17th of November, and\nauthored by George Cross, the Club\nCaptain of the Medicals team. His\nextended statement on the matter\nis below. The appeal was rejected the\nfollowing day.\nCross appealed specifically against\nthe social ban element of their\npunishment, as the sanctions levied\nagainst the club currently prevent\nthem hosting the Reynolds bar\u2019s\nChristmas Bop. Traditionally, the\nbigger sports clubs with greater\nfinancial pressures, such as the\nMedicals Rugby team, run the\nChristmas Bop, which are very\npopular and often attended by both\nmedic and non-medical students.\nRunning the Bop would have\nhopefully recovered some of the costs\nlost, although it seems doubtful it\nwould be able to recuperate all of the\ncosts from the coach incident. They\nhave already missed several matches,\nand incurred fines as a result, and\nhave also had to cover the costs of the\ncoach damages and loss of earnings of\nthe coach company.\nSaid Cross in his appeal: \u201cIt will be\nan opportunity where we can prove\nour responsibility as a club and\nshowcase the fact we can be sober at\nevents as we will be responsible for\nstewarding.\u201d\nThey also challenged details that\nwere taken in the minutes by the\nGovernance committee. Although\nCross stated in the appeal that \u201cMy\ncommittee was and continues to\nbe embarrassed by the situation,\u201d\nthey took issue with the fact that\nthe committee stated that the club\nis \u201cresigned\u201d to the drinking culture\nwithin the club.\nCross outlined that \u201cbefore\nsanctions were imposed by the Union,\nthe club had begun to address this\nissue already, by creating a series\nof documents including a \u2018Club\nAlcohol Policy,\u2019 \u2018Tour Etiquette,\u2019 and\n\u2018Statement of Aims and Objectives.\u2019\u201d\nThe appeal, made by email, also\nfeatured a letter from Dariush to\nDame Julia Higgins. In it he stated\nthat he was \u201cConcerned that the\nGovernance Committee did not\ntake into account the financial\nramifications the sanctions would\nhave on the club.\u201d He pointed out that\nwith the costs to repair the coach, the\nBritish University & College Sport\nleague fines the team having to pay\nfor missing games and also the loss of\nearnings from being unable to host\nthe bop, the team will be \u201cfinancially\ndeficit within two years.\u201d\nHe also compared the sanctions\nagainst Imperial Medicals against\nthose that were held against Imperial\nCollege Union Rugby Football Club,\nusually known as ACC (Athletics\nClub Committee) rugby. These too\nwere suspended from playing and\nsocialising due to the ruling of the\ngovernance committee in response\nto the incident involving team\nplayers stripping on tube platforms,\nwhich took place towards the end of\nOctober.\nDariush highlighted that despite\nMedicals Rugby team left broke afte\nLast year's Imperial Medicals team celebrate their JPR Williams Cup victory at the Stoop Photo: Ian Gillett\n\n"

After\ninitially glancing at the subtitle \u201cget\nactive, no hassle,\u201d the anonymous first\nyear aeronautics student was hopeful\nthat finally he might get some information on how to address his flagging\nissue.\nHowever, he was left\ndisappointed when upon closer\ninspection he realised the leaflet\nwas actually advertising the\nnew Imperial Sport programme,\nknown as \u201cImpetus.\u201d\nThe scheme, that costs \u00a330,\nallows students to play sports\nwithout the having to commit\nand play in leagues.

The scanner was seemingly\ndismantled and carried out of the\nbuilding, in a manner that, according\nto a mechanic \u201cwould imply those\nremoving the scanner has some crude\nknowledge of medical machinery.\u201d\nCCTV was unable to capture the\nculprits on camera, as those cameras\nlocated in the vicinity were also\ndismantled and removed too. The\nsame mechanic told hangman, \u201cIt was\nlike these culprits had experience with\nthis sort of crime: the latest footage to\nbe recovered shows a group of men,\nsemi-naked, approaching the camera\nwith an apparent look of apprehension\non their faces. They then purposefully\ngrasped the side of the camera, and the\nscreen goes blank.\n\u201cIt was like they knew exactly how\nto stop a camera from capturing what\nthey were doing.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 31\n28.11.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEarlier this month, the author\nSaladin Ahmed wrote on\nTwitter \u201cthe fantasy vision of a\nmedieval Europe devoid of people of\ncolour isn\u2019t realism. It\u2019s a different\nword that starts with \u2018r\u2019 and ends with\n\u2018ism\u2019.\u201d\nI\u2019ve always been interested in art,\nand in all of those years of admiring\nRenaissance and Medieval artworks,\nthe thought that I was not seeing\nthe whole picture never occurred\nto me. The absence of art depicting\npeople of Asian and African descent\nin European art history seemed\nto me more an artefact of the\nlack of globalisation rather than\nthe erasure of existing artworks\nbecause they don\u2019t fit in with our\npreconceived ideas of Medieval and\nRenaissance society. But even my\nmost rudimentary of research has\nshown me that people of colour have\nbeen depicted throughout European\nart history, often as any other citizen\nwould have been, at all strata of\nsociety; yes, as slaves, but also as\ncourtiers, nobility and men and\nwomen of wealth and power.\nThese artworks are not even as\nobscure as one might imagine, often\nthe true story lies in looking closer at\nfamiliar works of art and recognising\nwhat is already there. The Garden\nof Earthly Delights \u2013 the triptych\npainting by the Dutch master\nHieronymous Bosch dates from the\nlate 15th\ncentury; three oak panels,\nit depicts a scene from Genesis,\nshowing amongst others things, the\npresentation of Eve to Adam by God.\nIt has been heaped with praise and\neven inspired Joan Miro and Salvador\nDali; but what art history books fail\nto mention is the incorporation of\nnot one but at least 17 figures that\nare clearly of African descent in\naddition to many others of different\nskin tones. This highlights the power\nthat erasure and miseducation\nholds; because we have been taught\nnot to expect it, we often dismiss it\naltogether.\nPeople of colour (who were\ndefinitely not enslaved) have\nbeen incorporated into tableaux\nthroughout European art history \u2013\nthere are black bystanders in Liberale\nda Verona\u2019s work Dido\u2019s Suicide, an\nEthiopian envoy forms part of one of\nCarlo Saraceni\u2019s frescoes created in\n1617. Scenes depicting the adoration\nof the magi have always shown at\nleast one king of the three to be a\nman of Middle Eastern or African\ndescent. These depictions range\nfrom Spanish paintings to Italian\nfrescoes to German wood cuttings,\nshowing that Europe has always been\na place that people of all nationalities\nand skin colour have travelled to,\nworked and settled in. The idea of a\ncompletely white Europe simply has\nnever existed.\nSo if this art has always existed,\nwhy is it not taught in our schools?\nWhy do we as children grow up\nwith an idea of Renaissance and\nMedieval society as one that is deeply\nsegregated? Evidence suggests that\nthis may have more to do with the\ninfluence of the 18th and 19th art\nhistorians than historical truth.\nTake for instance the case of the\nBlack Madonnas of Europe. Over 450\n\u2018Black Virgins\u2019 exist across Europe,\nincluding those attributed to Saint\nLuke who is said to have painted his\ncopies from life \u2013 a dark skinned\nVirgin Mary from an African or\nMiddle Eastern background. What\nis striking is that accounts of these\npieces do not hint that contemporary\nviewers found her anomalous in any\nway, simply referring to her as \u2018Our\nLady\u2019 without comment on skin hue.\nIt is only in the 18th or 19th\ncentury that these were seen to need\nexplanation, the perceived darkening\nof skin tone was attributed to an\naccumulation of smoke, careless\nhandling by worshippers and\ndeterioration of pigment. These\ntheories have now mostly been\ndebunked, showing that hues would\nhave deteriorated to a distinctly\nMartian green as opposed to the\nbrown of darker skin.\nIn the 18th and 19th century\nmany of these were painted over,\nincluding the statue of Mother and\nChild in Tindari, Sicily with its Latin\ninscription \u201cnigra sum, sed formosa [I\nam dark, yet beautiful]\u201d. \u2018Explanations\u2019\nfor Robert Campin of Fl\u00e9malle\u2019s\n1410 St Veronica painting with its\ndark skinned Christ are never offered\nup by artists of the time. It is only\nin later centuries that we find art\nhistorians trying to justify them as\nby this time, colonialism had meant\ndarker skin tones were seen as of less\naesthetic value.\nIn From Majesty to Mystery: Change\nin the Meanings of Black Madonnas\nfrom the Sixteenth to Nineteenth\nCenturies the anthropologist Monique\nScheer notes that \u201cJohann Wolfgang\nvon Goethe also expressed a sense of\naesthetic disappointment in black\nMadonnas in a comment from\n1816: \u201cHow the most unhappy of\nall appearances could have crept\nTransforming Modern Perceptions of Medieval Art\nIndira Malik explains how prejudices have clouded our appreciation of art\nSt Veronica by Robert Campin of Fl\u00e9malle (1410)\nin \u2013 that, probably for Egyptian or\nAbyssinian reasons, the Mother\nof God is portrayed as brown, and\nthe face of Our Saviour printed\non Veronica\u2019s veil was also given a\nMoorish colour \u2013 may be clarified\nwhen that part of art history is more\nclosely examined.\u201d\u201d\nAs modern viewers we need to\nrecognise that our perceptions of\nhistory and art have often been\nformed by people such as Goethe\nwhose racist and colonial views\nhave informed our idea of what was\n\u2018normal\u2019 in Medieval or Renaissance\nEurope.\nArt history may not seem like\na significant issue in the face of\non-going racial unrest. Only this\nweek, violent riots have resumed\nin Ferguson, Missouri when state\nprosecutors declined to bring charges\nagainst officer Darren Wilson who\nshot and killed Michael Brown, an\nunarmed Black teenager. But, history\nforms a large part of our identity and\nthe way we see the people around us.\nIn Black Indian: A Hidden Heritage,\nWilliam Lorenz Katz writes \u201cIf\nyou know I have a history, you will\nrespect me.\u201d and the sentiment was\nreflected by Chimamanda Ngozi\nAdichie in her 2009 TED talk:\n\u201cPower is the ability not just to tell\nthe story of another person, but to\nmake it the definitive story of that\nperson. Show a people as one thing,\nonly one thing, over and over again,\nand that is what they become\u201c.\nRepresentation is important; it is\nimperative that the history of people\nof colour in Europe does not become\ntied wholly to slavery and that the\ndiverse heritage of Medieval Art is\nnot lost in the tired trope of racism\nweakly disguised as \u2018historical\ninaccuracy\u2019.\nThe erasure of people of colour\nfrom the narrative of Medieval art\nis not only essential for the way we\nrelate to various groups of people\ntoday but to the art itself. As the\nfamous Guerilla Girls piece reads,\n\u201cyou\u2019re seeing less than half the\npicture without the vision of women\nartists and artists of colour\u201d. But this\ncould so easily refer to the art as well\nas the artists. In his essay on art and\npropaganda George Orwell wrote:\n\u201cevery work of art has a meaning\nand a purpose \u2014 a political, social\nand religious purpose\u2026 our aesthetic\njudgements are always coloured by\nour prejudices and beliefs.\u201d\nIt is important that we learn to\nrecognise our prejudice as artists\nbut also as modern critics; it is true\nas Goethe writes that Medieval art\nneeds to be more closely examined,\nbut perhaps ultimately it reveals\nmore about our own ideas and\nprejudices than it does about the\noriginal artists.\n\"The\nidea of a\ncompletely\nwhite\nEurope\nsimply\nhas never\nexisted.\"\n\"... perhaps\nultimately\nit reveals\nmore about\nour own\nideas and\nprejudices\nthan\nit does\nabout the\noriginal\nartists\"\n\n"

Without needing hypnosis\nor any authoritarian commands, LSD\ninduced a state of plasticity in the\nvolunteers\u2019 perception of the world,\nindicating big potential for use in\npsychotherapy.\nHowever, it remains a territory that\nsome people from a strict medical\nperspective might question. \u201cThere is\nthis psychological element that some\npeople might find too qualitative and\nabstract. But you just have to look at\nthe placebo effect to see how effective\nit can be,\u201d Carhart-Harris explains.\nADDICTIONS\nAlongside apparent heightened\nsuggestibility, Carhart-Harris\u2019\nresearch indicates that LSD could\nhelp with the treatment of addictions\nand depression. \u201cOrdinarily when\nwe experience the world, we do so in\nsuch a constrained manner...habits\nand routines we have are all about\ndigging certain channels in a way that\nwe slip into,\u201d he says. \u201cPsychedelics\nstart to fill in those channels that have\nalready been dug out so that they are\nshallower and you can start falling\ninto different channels.\u201d\nThis happens not just on a\nmetaphorical level but also mirrors\nwhat Carhart-Harris has found in\nchanges of brain activity. \u201cBrain\nactivity is governed to a large extent\nby important hub structures that are\nimportant for governing the channels\nof activity that the brain supports,\nand to some extent constraining the\ncircuitry of the brain. What we see\nwith LSD and other psychedelics is\nthat these hub structures are affected\nand their activity is disturbed, which\nseems to allow the brain to work in an\nunconstrained manner. Cognition can\nbe more flexible and to some extent\nbroader as connections can be formed\nbetween regions that are ordinarily\nnot connected or weakly connected, so\nwe see this heightened plasticity and\nintercommunication within the brain\nthat we would not see ordinarily,\u201d he\nexplains.\nUsing psychedelics to disrupt\nreinforced patterns on the brain in\npeople with addictions or depression\ncould introduce a suppleness of the\nmind, where new things can be learnt\nwhilst old things are unlearnt. A\nrecent study in the United States into\npsilocybin (magic mushrooms) and\ntobacco addiction, found that 80% of\nsmokers treated with psilocybin, with\nthe intention of giving up cigarettes,\nabstain from smoking 6 months after\nthe treatment, a better result than the\ncurrent best treatment for tobacco\naddiction.\n\u201cI have a strong conviction that\n[psychedelics] will develop into\ntherapeutics in the coming decades,\u201d\nCarhart-Harris says.\nHALLUCINATIONS\nOut of interest, I thought I\u2019d pick the\ndoctor\u2019s brain on his theory behind\nthe manifestation of hallucinations\nwhile under the influence of\npsychedelic drugs. These phantom\nvisions have historically played a\nhuge role in mysticism, the history of\nreligion and the religious experience.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a really good\nexplanation for hallucinations, but\nwe have some clues,\u201d he says. \u201cOne\nexplanation I could offer is that the\nbrain holds priors or predictions\nabout what it is going to be given in\nterms of sensory information. We\ncome into this world with some innate\ninformation about what the world\nwill be like, but you also develop an\nincredible amount of knowledge about\nhow the world is and this develops\nover time so that we can process the\nworld much more accurately and\nprecisely.\nWhat you see with psychedelics\nis that these priors and predictions\nstart slipping into conscious when\nnot induced,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cEssentially\nwhat you are seeing under LSD is the\nbrain itself, the information that the\nbrain already holds is slipping into\nour normal consciousness.\u201d\nDMT\n\u201cThere are always drugs we would\nlike to look at, but are unable to\nbecause of limited resources and\nprioritising research\u201d Carhart-Harris\nsays when asked if there were any\nother psychedelics he would like\nto investigate apart from LSD and\npsilocybin.\n\u201cAn interesting one is N,Ndimethyltryptamine (DMT), which\noccurs endogenously within the\nhuman body and in other organisms,\nand is prevalent in the plant world.\nIt is amazingly similar in molecular\nstructure to other chemicals present\nwithin the body that do important\nthings in terms of psychology, like\nserotonin for example,\u201d he says.\nThere are many wild and wonderful\ntheories surrounding DMT and\npeople have theorised that it may be\nresponsible for certain endogenous\npsychedelic, mystical-type experiences\nand how these arise in certain\ncircumstances such as near-death.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I agree, it\u2019s good to keep\nan open mind\u2026 but there is another\ntheory that is more intuitively\nappealing \u2013 that states of naturally\noccurring psychosis, when people go\n\u2018mad\u2019 so to speak, is due to endogenous\npsychedelic-like compounds being\nreleased in the brain, DMT is the main\ncandidate for that \u2013 but there is no\nevidence.\u201d\nIn order to get some conclusive\nbacking for this theory, researchers\nwould need to carry out a spinal tap\nand analyse the cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) to give a good index of what\u2019s\nin the brain in someone in a state of\nacute psychosis. \u201cSome of the best\nstudies that would really crack a\nproblem, are simply not feasible,\u201d\nCarhart-Harris says.\nPsychedelic research is still very\nyoung, but seems to be an incredibly\nfertile domain and on the up. Of\ncourse, these compounds are to be\ntreated with caution and CarhartHarris\u2019 research is carried out under\ncarefully controlled settings. \u201cThe\ndangers with psychedelics arise when\nthey are taken without the proper\ncaution,\u201d he says.\nFor many drugs the decisions to\nclassify them under Schedule I in the\ncurrent UK drug legislation was made\nbefore modern scientific methods\nallowed a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of their pharmacology\nand toxicology. As a result, drugs were\nlumped into groups not based on any\nconsideration of their physical harms\nbut on the assumption they had no\ntherapeutic value.\nBy breaking the 50 year taboo\nsurrounding psychedelics in research\nand confronting the mysterious\nwith honest scientific methods, Dr\nRobin Carhart-Harris and his team of\nresearchers have found evidence that\ncontradicts this assumption.\nprocesses are underlying common\npsychopathologies. \u201cIt is under\nappreciated by mainstream\npsychology and cognitive\nneuroscience quite how important\nand useful psychedelic drugs can be\nfor explaining the mind,\u201d CarhartHarris says.\n\u201cPsychedelics are powerful scientific\ntools, in order to understand any\nphenomenon, a powerful strategy is to\nperturb the phenomenon, which LSD\ndoes.\u201d\n\"...new\nthings can\nbe learnt\nwhilst old\nthings are\nunlearnt.\"\n\"...studies\nthat would\nreally\ncrack a\nproblem are\nsimply not\nfeasible.\"\nVisualisation of homological scaffolds (a) placebo (b) psilocybin treatment.

It\u2019s not clear\nfrom the name but it is described as a\n\u2018personal physical activity monitor\u2019\nand in a nutshell it tracks how you\u2019re\nexercising and sleeping. It has a\nsimple circular LED display which\nmonitors your heart rate for different\nactivities (cycling, football, running\netc). It can double as a watch when\nMisMisit Flash\nrequired and runs on replaceable\nbatteries which last up to six months.\nIt can be found for less than \u00a350\nonline and is a bargain considering\nhow relatively new the market is to\nthis type of technology.\n2014: a monumental year for tech, bu\nSmartphones\nLaptops/Tablets\nGaming\nApple iPad Air 2\nIt has been claimed by some as\n\u201cthe best tablet ever made\u201dand\nwhen you consider you can pick up\nthe 16GB version for about \u00a3350 it\nis very good value too.It took on a\nvery good tablet in its predecessor\nand improved the processor and\ncamera whilst also introducing a\ningerprint sensor.\nIn the quest for thinness,Apple\nhad to sacriice the side switch\nwhich started a few teething issues\nwith its users but this has not\ndetracted from their achievement.\nOnboard is a 1.5GHz triple-core\nCPU,a total of 2GB of RAM and a\nIf you fancy something different\nthis Christmas then maybe a\nChromebook is for you.\nData is not really intended to\nbe stored on the device,but a\n16GB solid-state drive is part of\nthe package with an extra 100GB\nprovided on Google Drive for free\nfor two years.It runs on Google\u2019s\nown OS and doesn\u2019t have the\nsnazziest of specs.\nWhat this computer lacks in\ntoys,it makes up for in comfort\nand design.It\u2019s easy to type and\nmove the cursor with the trackpad\nand is as stylish as Apple laptops.\nIt has a standard 13.3 inch screen\nToshiba Chromebook\nand,like the Air,works with a\n1.4GHz processor.\nAnother pro is the battery life\nwhich will give you about 7 hours of\nApple MacBook Air 13 inch 2014\nThe Air is back again and although\nthere have only been a few tweaks\non previous iterations,this version\nof the MacBook looks like one of\nthe best laptops you can buy today.\nIts main selling point is its battery\nlife,going for about 10 hours\ndepending on the display mode.\nIt comes with an i5 processor\nruninng at 1.4GHz and 4GB of\nRAM.The design is much the same\nas before (not many people will\nargue that they are unattractive)\nbut what you lose out on to other\nlaptops is the relatively poor\nquality of screen,but igures such\nas contrast ratio and sRGB colour\nspace coverage are those which\nare going to be critiqued by the\nkeenest of eyes.At just under \u00a3700,\nthe Air is a bit pricy compared to\n7340mAh capacity battery which\nwill give you about 10 hours of work\nor play.Even more impressive are\nits dimensions-a 9.7 inch screen\non top of 6.1mm of well-crafted\ntechnology.I feel a few of these\nare going to end up under the\nChristmas tree next month.\nAlso worth a look...\nTheSurfacePro3 reviewed by\nOsama Awara in issue 1586,\nprobably established itself as the\nbest\u2018lablet\u2019you can buy (which will\nset you back about \u00a31250 for the\nwhole tablet + keyboard package).\nPhoto: IGN.com\nPhoto: htechnews.com\n\u201cHoney, I think we need to talk. I\nthink we need a new addition to the\nfamily. I think we need a Wii U\u201d. This\npleading will probably manifest in at\nleast one home this Christmas time.\nIt may or may not have something\nto do with the recent release of Super\nSmash Bros. for said console.

Having (somewhat\nunfairly) lost out to LSE last year in\nthe battle for the top spot, our team\nwas hungry for a chance to take back\nthe championship, which has been\nwon by Imperial for 10 out of the last\n12 years.\nIt became apparent as the medals\nstarted pouring in that this was our\nyear. By the end of the day we had\nracked up a massive 12 gold medals,\n10 silvers and another 9 bronze to\ntake the championships, pushing our\narch-rivals LSE down to 3rd place and\nwinning twice as many golds as 2nd\nplace UCL!\nStar performances in the field came\nfrom Stephanie Koumbas and Erik\nTropp who won gold in the high jump\nwith an all-Imperial podium in the\nmen\u2019s. George Cross led an ICSM\ndominated men\u2019s shot put and Ines\nKubler revealed her hidden strength\nto take gold for the women.\nIt was also the women who stole\nthe show on track. Fresher Alex\nMundell wowed the competition with\ntwo golds in the 400m and 800m, a\nsign of what we can expect over the\nnext 6 years! Final year medic Sian\nMitchell took gold in the 200m and\n60m hurdles. However, the athlete of\nthe day has to be Emma Watkins who\ncould barely stand upright under the\nweight of her 5 medals, including a\ngold in long jump.\nIn a very tense men\u2019s 60m final,\nChris Chung managed to edge\nout James Roughneen and Sidney\nChan to win gold and complete an\nimpressive Imperial 1-2-3. Gareth\nHolden faced an inopportune fire\nalarm delaying the race start in\nthe men\u2019s 400m but managed to\ntake home the silver medal. This,\nof course, led to the inevitable fire\nalarm selfies and a certain photo of\none Movember participant (who shall\nremain nameless) that will surely not\nbe forgotten. In the much anticipated\nrelays, the Imperial women\u2019s team\nand the men\u2019s 1st team claimed the\nsilver medals, both narrowly missing\nout on gold.\nPhil Hughes, Lewis\nHamilton, and SPOTY \u2013 the\nWorld Sport Column\nIn the early hours of Thursday,\nAustralia batsman Phil Hughes\nwas pronounced dead at St\nVincent\u2019s Hospital in Sydney. He had\nbeen struck on the side of the head\nby a bouncer from New South Wales\nbowler Sean Abbott in a Sheffield\nShield match on Wednesday. In\nresponse, Cricket Australia chose\nto abandon the round of domestic\nmatches being played this week. They\nalso chose to cancel India\u2019s warm-up fixture ahead of the series in\nAustralia. Pakistan and New Zealand\nchose to extend their test match by\na day and suspend play on Thursday\nout of respect, while England and Sri\nLanka will have a minute\u2019s silence\nahead of their match on Friday. An\nobituary for Phil Hughes is on page\n39.\nIn Formula 1 Lewis Hamilton won\nthe Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at the\nYas Marina Circuit to win the World\nChampionship. Nico Rosberg, who\nwas the only person who could catch\nHamilton, was only able to finish\n13th, after his car had power issues.\nIn the Champions League Chelsea\nproduced the \u201cperfect\u201d performance\nas they beat Schalke 5-0.

The real competition\nof who could brave the vindaloo was\nwon by James Roughneen who didn\u2019t\neven break a sweat (almost). The\ntrophy proved to be the perfect vessel\nfor toasting our success and ensuring\nsufficient levels of merriment all\nround. The last leg of the day (pun\nintended) involved a trip to Be at One,\nHammersmith where two for one\ncocktails went down very well. This\nrounded off what was a spectacular\nday for Imperial Athletics and a\nfantastic team performance to mark\nrecord levels of participation!

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 39\nFELIX\nSport Editor: Kunal Wagle\n28.11.2014\nRacism is unacceptable.\nRegardless of who you are, the\nsituation you find yourself in,\nor any excuses you may offer up, the\nmoment you bring up someone\u2019s race\nis the moment that you have crossed\nthe line. However, there seems to\nbe one area where casual racism is\nendemic, and is rarely punished. I am\ntalking about football. If you Google\nfootball and racism, you will come\nupon scores of results, and ones about\nthe lack of it are rare.\nWhile you may believe this is\nactually about sport in general you\nonly have to look as far as NBA to\nsee how racism is treated in other\nsporting activities. In April this\nyear, TMZ released a recording from\nSeptember 2013 between LA Clippers\nowner Donald Sterling and a female\nfriend.\nSterling told V. Stiviano: \u201cIt bothers\nme a lot that you want to broadcast\nthat you\u2019re associating with black\npeople\u201d, and, \u201cYou can sleep with\n[black people]. You can bring them in,\nyou can do whatever you want\u201d, but\n\u201cthe little I ask you is ... not to bring\nthem to my games\u201d. The person she\nhad posed with on Instagram? Magic\nJohnson, a Basketball Hall of Fame\nplayer. After the comments he made\nhe was subsequently forced to sell his\nfranchise, and now has a lifetime ban.\nThis all happened within the space of\nroughly two months.\nNow consider the strange situation\nof Malky Mackay. Almost three\nmonths ago text messages of\nhomophobic, racist and sexist nature\nwere revealed, which had been\nwritten by Mackay during his tenure\nas manager of Cardiff City. This was\nfurther exacerbated when the League\nManager\u2019s association declared that\nthis was all just \u201cfriendly text message\nbanter\u201d \u2013 a statement they soon\napologised for. What!\nHowever, it seems that this did\nnot seem to be the end of Mackay\u2019s\ncareer, as it justifiably should have\nbeen. Instead he has now found new\nemployment as manager of Wigan\nAthletic. You may think that would\nbe the end of this story. But wait,\nthere is more.\nIn response to the controversy\nthat surrounded the appointment of\nMackay, Dave Whelan, the Chairman\nand Owner, made equally horrible\nstatements in support of his manager.\nHe tried to veil his comments as\ncompliments as well as comment that\ncertain words weren\u2019t actually racist,\nbut this resulted in it just coming\nRacism in football: Is the sport living in a deluded bubble?\nMAX EGGL\nSPORTS WRITER\noff as worse. Yet, no forced sales, nor\nlifetime bans, for either of these two\nmen. In fact, the FA and by extension\nFIFA itself is doing next to nothing\nto stomp out this disease.\nThey may have their high profile\ncampaigns, but honestly is this really\ncutting down on racism? There have\nbeen so many high profile cases,\nwhich never really lead to any sort\nof meaningful punishments. John\nTerry? Was found guilty, fined about\ntwo weeks wages and missed four\ngames before resuming like nothing\nhad ever happened. Luis Suarez?\nOnce again found guilty, (strangely\nenough supported by his team and\nmanager) and now living the high\nlife in Barcelona. There are many\nmore examples, but all of them seem\nto reach the same ending; nobody is\nreally punished.\nIf nobody is ever really severely\npunished, this casual attitude to\nracism will continue. Imagine\nsaying comparable things to your\nfellow students or work colleagues.\nYou would rightly get the sack\nimmediately. Anybody who thinks\nsomething as horrid as one race being\nbetter than another is an individual\nwho should not be part of our society.\nBut football is one of the only fields\nwhere leniency is upheld. Why? Is it\nthat FIFA in their inexorable quest\nfor profits has forgotten how to keep\nthe beautiful game unblemished?\nOne of the possible reasons is because\nin banning people, they risk losing\nprofits. If they had banned Luis\nSuarez or John Terry more severely,\nthey may have faced lawsuits, and\nlost ticket revenues. Do they think\ntherefore that it is much better to\ngive a slap on the wrist, and hope it all\nblows over?\nI am not trying to say that racism\nhas been eradicated in all other\nsports, but in football it seems so\nmuch more prevalent. What really\nfrightens me is that whilst this game\nis able to transcend race, culture,\nlanguage and sex, it will never be\nable to cross boundaries, because\ncertain individuals permeate football\nand certain authorities refuse to do\nanything about it.\nMalky Mackay and Dave Whelan are currently under investigation by the FA Photo: Wigan Athletic Football Club\n8th March 2009,Kingsmead,\nDurban.An Australian batsman\nis entertaining the crowd with a\nsuperb hundred.It was his second\nof the game,and meant that he,at\nthe age of 20,became the youngest\nman to score two hundreds in a Test\nMatch.It was just his second test\nmatch.This week,we mourn his\npassing.\nPhillip Hughes,who would have\nturned 26 on Sunday,was largely\nconsidered one of Australia\u2019s most\ntalented batsmen when he started\nout for New South Wales at the\nage of 18.He became the youngest\nbatsman to score a century in the\nShefield Shield Final when he\nscored 116 against Victoria to lead\nhis side to victory.It was his maiden\nFirst Class century.\nOn Tuesday,when playing for\nhis adopted side South Australia\nagainst his former side New South\nWales,Hughes was struck by a\nbouncer from former colleague Sean\nAbbott.Hughes fell forward onto his\nface.He would remain unconscious\nuntil his death in the afternoon on\nThursday in Sydney.\nHughes struggled to make the\nAustralian team,after being\u201cfound\nout\u201dagainst the short ball by\nAndrew Flintoff in the 2009 Ashes,\nand had to settle for being the irst\nalternative for the national side.\nThat didn\u2019t stop him from scoring 86\nfrom 75 balls in a win against New\nZealand and his third test century\nagainst Sri Lanka in 2011.He was\nselected for the one-day squad in\n2013,where he became the irst\n(and only) Australian to score on a\nhundred on debut.He would add\none more in the same series.\nIn his inal game Hughes was on 63\nnot out before that fatal ball.His\nteam mate Kane Richardson paid\ntribute,saying\u201cEven in your last\ninnings they still couldn\u2019t touch you.\n63*\u201d\nHughes died from vertebral artery\ndissection,an injury that has only\never been recorded a hundred times.\nAnd only once due to a cricket ball.\nThe injury was described by doctors\nas\u201cextremely rare and a freak\ninjury\u201d.\nHe leaves behind his mother,father,\nbrother and sister.\nAnd a grieving cricket world.\nKUNAL WAGLE\nSPORT EDITOR\nPhil Hughes: The world mourns death of young batsman\nPhoto: Mike Hutchings/Reuters\n\n"

The\ncollege is conducting reviews of\nthe circumstances surrounding\nthe incident as a whole, including\nPhoto: Emily Maunder\naddressing policies and procedures\nrelevant to the case. The review will\nbe done by the Director of Human\nResources at Imperial, accompanied\nby the Senior Consul, Professor\nRichard Thompson.\nAny findings will then be reported\nto a group of senior college staff, led\nby the provost, who will then put into\nplace any recommendations deemed\nsuitable.\nAn Imperial College London\nspokesperson told Fe\u00aclix that: \u201cStefan\nGrimm was a valued member of the\nFaculty of Medicine and news of his\ndeath at the end of September came\nas a great shock to colleagues. The\nCollege has been in touch with his\nfamily since his death to offer our\ndeepest condolences.\n\u201cAt a time when family, friends,\ncolleagues and students are still\ncoming to terms with a death, it is\nimportant to undertake any reviews\nin a manner that respects these\nsensitivities, and that does not create\na more difficult or challenging\nenvironment for those people.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s University Challenge team inalised\nThe University Challenge team\nhas been finalised after an\nextensive selection process. The\nnew team consists of 5 male students\nand was selected after passing several\nrounds of quizzes and a final trial\nstage.\nThe team consists of three\nundergraduate students and two PhD\nstudents. Ben Fernando, a third year\nphysics student and Captain of last\nyear\u2019s team, has made a reappearance\nalongside James Bezer, a third year\nphysics student (and one of Felix\u2019s\nesteemed Science Editors).\nNew to the team is Ashwin Braude,\na fourth year physics student, and\nOnur Teymur, who is working on a\nPhD in statistics. Also joining them\nis Patrick Dunn, who is a physics\nstudent, also currently working on his\ndoctorate.\nThe selection process started a\nfew weeks ago, with quizzes held\nby Imperial College Union in\nconjunction with Quiz Soc. The\n60-question test culled down 100\nhopefuls to 16, who had a call-back for\nthe evening of Friday 21st November.\nThe final trial was a mock-up of\nteams being questioned, Jeremy\nPaxman style, and observed by\nImperial College Union President\nTom Wheeler and Student Trustee\nThomas Lim.\nThe 16 students were judged on\nhow they interacted as a team and\ntotal scores were also taken into\nconsideration before the panel\ndecided on the final five.\nThe team will now have another\ninterview with the producers of the\nshow in January where they will be\nasked more questions, and in the last\nweekend in February filming will\ncommence in the Granada studios in\nManchester.\n28 teams make it to the televised\nfinals.\nLast year the team was knocked out\nat the January stage, so did not make\nit onto the screens of households\nacross the country.\nThe series is due to air during the\nsecond half of August.\nPhilippa Skett reports as the inal team is chosen following weeks of quizzes\nImperial College returns to top of the\nResearch Council Grants Table\nImperial College has returned to\nthe top of the league table for\nresearch council income for the\nyear 2013-14. It is the fourth time in\nthe last five years that the College has\ntopped the table, having been in third\nplace for the year 2012-2013.\nIn this edition of the league table,\nImperial was awarded \u00a3114 million,\nan increase of \u00a311 million on 2012-13. This meant that the College was\none of only ten institutions that saw\nan increase of more than \u00a310 million.\nUniversity College London (UCL),\nwho were last year\u2019s leaders, saw their\nvalue of awards fall by 42 percent.\nCambridge saw their value diminish\nby 45 percent, as it fell to fifth in the\nrankings.\nDonal Bradley, Vice-Provost\n(Research), said that he was \u201cdelighted\nto see the dedication and hard work of\nour staff paying off in what remains a\ndifficult funding climate\u201d.\nImperial was successful in only 29\npercent of its applications, which,\nwhen compared to other Universities\nin the top ten, is quite low.

And\nthat is exactly what we have done.\nA little overview; Enforcer is a \u201clifesimulator\u201d game, with an emphasis\non the police force side of things. You\nare a police officer, starting out in a\nnew little mountain town, and the\naim is to advance your career in the\nforce with the ultimate goal of being\nthe chief. However, in addition to this\nyou can also live your life, designing\nyour home, having fun with your pals\nand visiting the town. Lastly since\nthis game is a simulator, everything\nis done with hyperrealism (as far as\npossible). Right now the game is in\nbeta, so lots of features are currently\nunimplemented and there are still\nlots and lots of bugs.\nWhen I was offered this game I was\nsuper excited. I get to play as a police\nofficer (maybe rampage a bit, GTA\nstyle), as well as do some of that stuff\nthat makes the Sims so fun. However,\nalmost never playing any simulator\ngames I did not know exactly what to\nexpect.\nI jumped into the game as Frank\n(the most generic policeman name\never!), and saw how efficient the\nexisting police force was in my town.\nAfter pulling out my sub-machine\ngun and gunning down some people,\nI came to the conclusion that they\nwere pretty useless. No sirens, no calls\nnot even the bystanders seemed to\ncare! Hmm, I definitely would not be\nrelying on my colleagues here. So I\npromptly changed into my uniform\nand started policing. As I drove my\ncar into town, I immediately got a\ncall to pick up a drunk who had been\n\"This is a\ngame about\ndecisions,\nand how\neach\ndecision\nwe make\naffects\nboth us\nand those\naround us.\"\n\"Your ex\nis now\ngetting\nmarried\nhalfway\nacross the\ncountry in\na month.\nSo what do\nyou do?\"\nPhoto: irrationalpassions\nAlwaysSometimesMonstersis\nanindiegamebyVagabond\nDogandDevolverDigital.The\nfirsttimeyouloaditup,you\u2019llseeatiny\n(560x454)windowwiththegamelogo\nand3buttons\u2013NewGame,Credits,\nandQuit.Yeah,nooptions.Thisisa\nprettysimplegame.Youcanadjustthe\nwindowbypressingF6orF7,which\nmakethewindowbiggerandfullscreen\nrespectively.Ifitdidn\u2019thavethose\noptions,thesizeofthewindowwould\nmakeAlwaysSometimesMonsters\nprettymuchunplayable.\nWhenyoupressNewGame,a\ncutscenewillstart.Thisshowsahitman\nwalkingawayfromhisemployer,trying\nandfailingtoquit.He\u2019sinterruptedby\narandomguyonthestreet,whooffers\ntotellhimastory.Youhavethechoice\ntoshoottheguyorlistentothestory\n\u2013shootingtheguywillendintheguy\ndying,andthehitmancarryingonwith\nhislife.Gameover.\nAfewthingshappeninquick\nsuccessionifyouchoosethe(obviously\nintended)listenoption.Theguytells\nthestoryofamanhostingaparty,as\nacelebrationforhisnewjob.Hetalks\ntoabunchofpeople,andyouchoose\nsomeoneforhimtodrinkwith.Allofa\nsudden,thecharacteryou\u2019recontrolling\nswitchesforthethirdtime.Theperson\nyouchosetodrinkwithneedstogoout\ntothebalconytofetchhis/herpartner.\nAfteralittlebitofthis,itbecomes\napparentthatthisisthecharacter\nyou\u2019regoingtobecontrollingformost\nofthegame,whichisgoodbecauseIwas\nstartingtogetmotionsicknessfromall\nthebody-jumping!\nFastforwardayearandyourpartner\nleftyou,you\u2019reabouttogetkicked\noutofyourflat,andyourbookdealis\nfallingthrough.Totopitalloff,once\nyou\u2019vebeenevictedyoufindthatyou\u2019re\nnotgettinganymorecashforthebook\nyouweresupposedtobewriting,and\nyourexisnowgettingmarriedhalfway\nacrossthecountryinamonth.Sowhat\ndoyoudo?Scroungetogetherasmuch\nmoneyasyoucanfromwhereveryou\ncangetitandrushmadlyacrossthe\ncountrytostophim/her,ofcourse!\nThecoreofthegameconsistsof\ncontrollingthisthirdcharacterthrough\nvariousscenarios.It\u2019sprettyopenended,eventhoughthere\u2019safinalgoal.\nForthemostpart,youexplorethe\ntownandtrytogetmoney.Thereare\nafewworkminigamesthatmeanthat\nit\u2019simpossibletorunoutofcash,but\nthesecanbeavoidedifyoudoallofthe\n\u2018quests\u2019correctly.\nTheinventorymanagementleaves\nabittobedesiredandsometimes\nit\u2019snotoverlyclearwhatyouneed\ntodo.Overallthough,thissimplistic\ngameplayworksquitewell.The\nmajorityofthegameisplot,andthat\u2019s\nhowitshouldbe.\nThisisagameaboutdecisions,and\nhoweachdecisionwemakeaffectsboth\nusandthosearoundus.Eventhefirst\ndecisionofthegame,whetherornot\ntolistentotheguyonthestreet,hasan\nenormousimpactonthegame.Sure,\ntheycouldhaveforcedyoutolisten,but\nthatwouldhavetakenawayfromthe\nmessage.Youcomeacrosssituations\nthroughoutwhereyouneedtodecideif\nyou\u2019regoingtodotherightthingorthe\nthingthatwillfurtheryourowngoals,\nandthere\u2019sa\u2018fate\u2019scorethatreflects\nhowmuchofadickyou\u2019vebeen.Inthe\nend,youonlyhave30daystoraisethe\ncashyouneedthough,sosometimes\nbeingadickisnecessary.Throughthe\ngame,theplayerisconstantlypresented\nwithinterestingchoices\u2013someofthese\nhavenoimpactandothershaveimpact\nfarbeyondwhatyoumightfirstexpect.\nIshouldlevelwithyouatthispoint:\nIhaven\u2019tfinishedthisgameyet.Steam\ntellsmethatI\u2019vebeenplayingfor3\nhours,soIexpectagood2-5morehours\nbeforeIdoso.Maybemystorywill\nendwithmyprotagonists(Samantha\nandLizzie)reuniting.Maybenot.But\nthat\u2019swhatthisgameisabout.Wedon\u2019t\nknowhowit\u2019sgoingtoend,wedon\u2019t\nknowwhenit\u2019sgoingtoend.Whatwe\ndoknowisthatourdecisionsmatter,\nandwhenitdoesendeverythingthat\nhappenswillhavebeenasaresultofthe\nchoiceswemadealongtheway.\nTriggerwarning:AlwaysSometimes\nMonstershascontentwithracism,\nsexism,homophobia,transphobia,\nmentalhealth,sexualassault,child\nabuse,animalabuse,drugabuse,and\nsuicide.\nAlwaysSometimesMonstersis\navailablefromtheHumbleStore(with\naSteamkey)ordirectlyfromSteamfor\n$9.99or\u00a36.99respectively.\ncausing problems. After scanning\nmy HUD I realised that I could find\nthis menace on the minimap. And\nSo I did. However, midway through\nmy handling of this rowdy character\nI was called in to take care of some\nmurderer who was wondering the\nstreets. I had to make the hard\ndecision which one was the bigger\nmenace to society, and in the end I\ndecided that the drunkard definitely\ncould cause more harm (also I was like\nright next to him so\u2026yeah). However,\nwhen I tried to apprehend him\nand send him to the can, the game\ncrashed. Maybe the game judged me\non my ethics?\nOh well, so I started the game up\nagain and tried to make the good\nchoices. This time I was trying to\narrest some woman who had stolen\nfrom the bank. Not only did I end up\nchasing her for about a mile, the game\nended up crashing once again when\nI tried to send her to jail. So it wasn\u2019t\nmy choices!\nThe experience of the constant\ncrashing really ruined the game for\nme, especially since it was one of the\nmajor mechanics of the game that\ncaused the crash, meaning that I\nalmost couldn\u2019t play.\nSo presently I am pausing the game\nand waiting for it to be in a better\nstate before I play it again. Currently,\nthe AI is quite stupid, there are quite a\nfew bugs and lots of crashing. I mean,\nthe potential is definitely there. I felt\nreally badass (yes okay I know I am\nsad) when I was breathalysing people\nand giving them tickets, but on the\nother hand I couldn\u2019t really send\nthem to jail because the game would\nthen crash.\nSo I would advise y\u2019all, as much as\nyou love simulator games, to wait this\none out. The game will be awesome,\nbut not in its present state.\nPhoto: excalibur-publishing\n\n"

The suburb has been\nunsettled since 9th August when\npolice officer Darren Wilson shot and\nkilled civilian Michael Brown. Mr\nWilson, who shot Brown six or seven\ntimes said that he \u201cfeared for his life\u201d.\nWitnesses, however, claimed that Mr\nBrown, who was not armed, had his\nhands up when the first shots were\nfired.\nOn Tuesday a jury chose not to\ncharge Mr Wilson for the killing\nand as a result clear the police\nofficer of any wrongdoing. This\nsparked protests in Ferguson, which\nwere peaceful. The protests, which\nconsisted of an estimated 100 people\nmarching through the streets, were\nconducted in the snow. It is believed\nthat the bad weather may have had\nan effect on the number of people\nprotesting.\nPolice Officer Wilson said\nafterwards on television that he\nhad \u201ca clean conscience\u201d over the\nshooting. This statement was branded\nas \u201cdisrespectful\u201d by Mr Brown\u2019s\nmother, who went on to add that\nshe does not believe the policeman\u2019s\naccount of what happened that night.\nMr Brown\u2019s father said that\nprosecutors had \u201ccrucified\u201d his son\nin a character assassination. He then\nrequested that all protesters remain\npeaceful.\nMeanwhile, in California, protests\nturned violent in Oakland and Los\nAngeles.

You play as Isaac\nand must traverse through many\nfloors, each of which are randomly\ngenerated each time, and defeat the\nenemies with your tears. Each floor\ncontains many rooms and these\ncan contain monsters, treasure and\nitems. At the end of each floor you\nmust face off against a boss to open\nthe trapdoor to the next floor. Each\nfloor gets harder and harder but\nthis is balanced by the items you\nfind which serve to give you more\nhealth, let you deal extra damage\nand much more.\nThe main attraction of this game\nis its rogue-like play style. Each\ntime you play the game you get\ndifferent items, face a different\nlayout and have to defeat different\nenemies. Binding of Isaac is (at\nleast for me) a hard game where\non an average run I can do 3 or 4\nlevels but on a good run \u2013 which\nis a mixture of skill and good luck\nJebediah Kerman\nDay 1, Hour 4\nIt\u2019s with a heavy heart and a\ntear-tinged eye that the Kerbal\nSpace Centre has to announce the\npassing of Captain Jebediah Kerman\nthis week, following a rapid and\nslightly less-controlled-than-planned\nlanding of his space craft \u2014 The Ugly\nDuck II \u2014 about 20 metres south of\nthe launch pad he had departed from\n30 seconds beforehand.\nCpt J. Kerman had already\ndemonstrated his excellent flying\ncapabilities as pilot of the first ever\nmission launched by the Kerbal\nSpace Program, the Ugly Duck I.\nJebediah was always first in line\nfor missions with the KSP based in\npart on his enthusiasm, courage,\nand default setting at the top of\nthe list as programmed into the\ngame. His tragic death was a freak\naccident, inasmuch as the engineer\nwho designed the Ugly Duck II\nhad forgotten to check the staging\ncommands properly so that when\nthe main rocket engines fired, the\nparachute deployed simultaneously,\nBill Kerman\nDay 2, Hour 3\nThe Kerbal Space Centre regrets\nto announce the death of\nCommander Bill Kerman\nafter a spacewalk inadvertently went\ncompletely bollocks up. Commander\nB. Kerman had nobly stepped into\nthe shoes of Jebediah Kerman\n(which miraculously had survived\nthe wreckage of the Ugly Duck II\ndisaster almost intact) and had been\nthe primary pilot of the subsequent\n2 missions launched as part of the\nKerbal Space Program.\nAs commander of the Ugly Duck III\nmission, Bill became the first Kerbal\nto leave the atmosphere, reaching\na record height of 82,000 metres\nabove the surface of Kerbin. The\nsubsequent Ugly Duck IV mission\nsaw Bill become the first Kerbal to\nachieve orbit. Or rather it would\u2019ve\ndone if he hadn\u2019t decided to let go of\nthe side of the spacecraft whilst on\nEVA. Unfortunately ground-control\nhadn\u2019t actually noticed that Bill had\ntaken such a rouge action for quite\nsome time, as they were busy taking\nscreenshots for the KSP forum.\nQuestions are being asked about\nground-control\u2019s attempts to rescue\nBill, as various commands sent to\nhis EVA suit saw him drift wildly\nfar away from the craft as there was\ndecided confusion as to whether or\nnot the shift key meant up or down.\nBy the time common sense\nprevailed, Cmdr Kerman was 2km\naway from his craft, and out of\nmonopropellant. Friends and family\nhave all taken solace in the fact that,\nin death, as in life: Bill was too stupid\nto realise what abject peril he was\nconstantly in.\nIn the irst of a weekly installment Matt Allinson mourns his brave Kerbals\ndestroying them and sending the\nwhole craft into an unrecoverable\nspin. We can all take encouragement\nknowing that Jebediah died doing\nwhat he loved: experiencing 4 vertical\ng and 6 lateral g whilst pointing\nstraight at the ground travelling at\n140m/s. A true Kerbal Hero.\nRIP Jeb and Bill: Their sacrifice will never be forgotten Photo: Tumblr\n\u2013 I can do more. There is a steep\nlearning curve; beginners might\nfind it hard to get past the first level\nbut pro players can consistently\nget to the end and defeat mum.\nNo matter what level of skill you\nhave with this game the random\nelements of this game means that\nthere is aways a lot to see and\ndiscover even in the early levels. As\nyou play more and improve you will\nbegin to recognise patterns in how\nthe game plays and get excited when\nyour favourite item pops up.\nThe \u2018rebirth\u2019 of the game takes\nthe flash-based original and makes\nit what it always should have been.\nThe game now crashes less, has\nan even more beautiful Edmund\nMcMillen art style and has about\n100 new items. The game has been\nleft alone in all the right places\nwhilst also being improved and\nexpanded. Everything that was\nalready great and addictive about\nthis game is now even greater and\nmore addictive. Even players who\nmastered the original game will\nwant the new version because of its\nnew hard mode (as if the original\nwasn\u2019t hard enough). The PSVita\nversion plays very well, controls\nnaturally and the nature of Binding\nof Isaac means its perfect for a train\nor bus journey.\nOverall this game isn\u2019t new but\nit is definitely worth picking up\nwhether you are new to Isaac or\neven if you\u2019re an avid fan.\n\n"

The\ncompetition, now in its 20th year,\nwas featured in the 2012 film Pitch\nPerfect, which introduced the world\nto the now widely known \u2018Cups\u2019. The\nsequel has been confirmed for release\nin 2015.\nOn January 24th, 2015, eight a\ncappella groups from UK universities\nwill compete to win a place at the\nInternational Final, to be held in\nNew York City.\nThis is the first time that there\nhas been a round held outside of the\nUSA, although video entry has been\nallowed since 2012. The event will\nbe organised by Matthew Shirer, the\nICCA Overseas Producer at Varsity\nVocals.\nAlthough the A Cappella Society\nis hosting the event, Varsity Vocals\ninitially contacted the individual\ngroups separately regarding the\nuse of the Great Hall. There were\nsome issues with getting the space\nfor a reasonable price, with Henry\nHarrod, the A Cappella Society Chair,\ndescribing the situation as \u201cpretty\nheated in that respect\u201d.\nFollowing close to four weeks of\nnegotiation on the price, Henry was\non the phone to Varsity Vocals to\ncancel the College\u2019s participation\nin the event, when Campus Services\noffered a discount.\n\u201cAs I was sitting there, I got\nthe email through from Charles\n[Gallagher, Head of Hospitality and\nEvents], at the very last minute, and\u2026\nICCA\u2019s accepted over the phone.\u201d\nThree of the eight groups\ncompeting are London-based.\nImperielles, The Scopes and The\nTechtonics all perform regularly\nand have previously competed in\nThe Voice Festival UK (VFUK), the\nUK version of ICCA, The Techtonics\nreaching the final in 2014. This will\nbe the first time that Imperielles\nand The Scopes have competed at a\nnational competition.\nAll the King\u2019s Men, from\nKing\u2019s College London, round out\nthe London-based groups, with\nfour further groups coming from\nBirmingham, Durham, and Exeter.\nAll of the teams perform regularly,\nincluding visits to the Edinburgh\nFringe Festival, and many have\nplaced in national competitions.\nEntries to the competition were\nby video audition, to be submitted\nby 15th November. A successful\naudition would give a place in the\nCollege-hosted semi final, at the hefty\nprice tag of \u00a3200 \u2013 double that of an\nentry to VFUK.\nThe three groups who chose to enter\nfilmed their audition videos in the\nrecently renovated West Basement\nstudio, with Media groups assisting\nwith lighting and sound. Henry\nacknowledged \u201cteething problems\u201d,\nwith this being one of the first times\nthe Studio had been used in anger,\nbut pointed out that all three groups\nthat auditioned had been selected to\ncompete. Take Note, the society\u2019s\nother all-female barbershop group,\nchose not to enter.\nThe Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) and the Deputy President\n(Finance & Services) have already\nconfirmed their attendance at the\nevent, and other major figures on\ncampus will be invited, including\nCharles Gallagher, the campus official\nwho sent the eleventh hour email that\nsaved the event.\nThe event will also feature a guest\nperformance from Birmingham\nUniversity\u2019s Sons of Pitches, who\ncompeted at the 2013 ICCA Final in\nNew York.\nThey have since gone semi-professional, having released\ntheir debut EP, Not Too Shabby in\nDecember 2013. Despite this, they\ncontinue to compete, singing against\nThe Techtonics in the VFUK final\nlast year.\nA Cappella Society was founded in\nNovember 2010 and now comprises\nfour groups, with two more in the\nworks. Each of the groups has a\ndifferent style, and all maintain\na set to be performed over the\nyear. Multiple groups are working\non recording releases, with The\nTechtonics aiming to release a single\nclose to Christmas, and an album in\nAugust 2015.\nAll of the groups have expressed\ntheir excitement, with Peter Noden\n(The Techtonics Chair) describing it\nas \u201cthe opportunity to perform and\nmeet with the best of the British and\nglobal a cappella communities\u201d.\nImperial: Prepare to get Pitch-Slapped\nBen Howitt on the International singing competition to be hosted at Imperial\nA representative from The Scopes\nsaid:\n\u201cWe\u2019re so honoured to be\ncompeting in the first ever UK\nICCA\u2019s Semi-Final and it being held\nat Imperial was just an added bonus!\nWe can\u2019t wait to see the other groups\nperform and to show the judges and\nthe local crowd what we\u2019ve been\nworking on!\u201d\nThe movement of A Cappella to\nthe UK has been a slow one, but the\naddition of a true international\ncompetition is a big step in the right\ndirection.\nWe here at Felix wish the\ncompeting groups the very best of\nluck, and hope that the competition is\nappropriately aca-awesome.\nThe Scopes performing at Summer Ball 2014 (bottom) and Imperielles (top) Photo: Imperialelles/ Ben Lester\n\n"
