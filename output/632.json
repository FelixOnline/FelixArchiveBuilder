Win\nand Pat, played by Gemma Jones and Jim\nBroadbent respectively, arrive from a more\npress uri sed life in urban West Germany. They\nare inseparable teenage friends of years ago.\nBut the future has slipped in almost\nunawares. Whelan has made the main\ncharacter, Win, to stand for all of us who have\never looked for a refuge from that future. But\nher 'countryside of the mind' contains people,\nthe old teenage foursome. Her refuge is mutual\nlove and affection. The play is a sort of comedy\nof embarrassment as the two couples meet\nafter such a long separation and talk about\ntheir past and future intentions.\nBut it is the present the play is concerned\nabout and the way our 'mental refuge' can be\ngiven a nasty jolt by the unexpected sudden arrival of the future.\nThe play is very confident and clever, and\nquite rich in meaning. Some interesting\nparallels are drawn between clay and people (!)\nand the production has an excellent cast to\nboot.

The Oba, though not\ninvolved, consulted an oracle who predicted\nthe white men would destroy. his city. To\nappease the gods, and avert this disaster, he\nordered large numbers of human sacrifices\nand the decaying bodies were found by the\nRoyal Navy expedition when it reached Benin.\nHorrified, they exiled the Oba, cleared up the\ncarnage and then, to cover the expedition's costs (!), sold off ivories and bronzes found in\nthe palace. Many were bought by the British\nMuseum and placed in the ethnological\ndepartment where they were exhibited as the\nartifacts of primitive savages.\nOver the next twenty years the sculptures\nwere 'rediscovered'\u2014they inspired many\nEuropean artists, not least of whom Picasso,\nwho found them a trigger towards the\ndevelopment of Cubism.\nIt is only within the last forty years that other\nNigerian art-traditions too have been seriously\ninvestigated by archaeologists and art\nhistorians. The sculptors' technical skill in\nmodelling and firing terracotta and in casting\nbronze, using the lost wax method,\"Was\nextraordinary: the gallery guide supplied for\nthe price of admission, will elaborate on\ntechnical details.\nAppreciation back to front?\nWhat I found d is orientating, but ultimately\nrewarding, about the exhibition was its feeling\nof familiarity. I have an instinctive sympathy for\nthe Cubists' analysis and synthesis of forms:\nI 've grown up under their influence, subconsciously abos r bing cubist posters,\narchitecture, etc. The Royal Academy\nexhibition was rather like meeting a close\nfriend's family and recognising his mannerisms\nand the shape of his nose in his parents. Quite\nthe 'Wrong' way round\u2014Picasso achieved a new analysis of reality by penetrating the\nromantic haze that surrounded primitive\nobjects at the turn of the century, and seeing\nthem for the first time as just another kind of\nart: an art with a different concept of form,\nconcerned not with presenting illusions but\nwith making ritualistic totems and ceremonial\nmasks. It is this feeling of art as creation,\nrather than some sort of imitation, that comes\nacross so strongly from the Benin and Tsoede\nbronzes. In the terracotta Nok sculptures\n(dated 500BC to 500AD) the act of creation is\nthat of assembling abstract geometrical forms:\nthe style is one of sophisticated simplicity.\nIn complete contrast is the striking\nnaturalism of the metal heads of Ife. Idealised\nfeatures represent the stately bearing of the\nroyal figures and clearly demonstrate that\n'black is beautiful'.\nThe scope of this exhibition is considerable\nbut as a Walkabout-Looksee it seems tailor made \u2014equally fascinating to the archaeologist,\nthe 20th Century-art-enthusiast and the\namateur of smithing and casting techniques.\nWhere, When, \u00a3?\nTreasures of Ancient Nigeria is at the Royal\nAcademy of Arts, Burlington House, Piccadilly\nuntil 23 January 1983.

    "content": "EDITORIAL\nSouthside Security\nThree years ago a female student\nwas raped in Southside. A man\nused the lift to take her down to\nthe basement so that no one\nwould be able to hear her cries\nfor help. As a result of this, it\nwas decided that security in the\nbuilding was too lax and that\neverything possible should be\ndone to prevent such a thing\nhappening again. This is why the\n'basement' buttons on the\nSouthside lifts are now sensibly\nfitted with key switches, and why\nthere are wide-angled mirrors in\nthe entrance lobbies.\nBut another measure was\nintroduced at the same time, and\none which is by no means\nobligatory for the security of the\nHall: it was decided that the\nouter doors which lead into the\nlobbies should be locked at\n6:00pm and that all the doors\nshould be locked at 7:00pm. What does this achieve, apart\nfrom inconveniencing several\nhundred students and their\nfriends? While it is necessary to\nshut out a wide variety. of undesirables, ranging from\npotential rapists to thieves to\ntramps and illicit users of the\nlaundry, one wonders how is this\nachieved by locking up as early\nas 7:00 rather than at 11:30. say,\nwhen the bars are shut and social\nactivities begin to wind down.\nOn Saturdays and Sundays the\nposition is even more ludicrous,\nfor the security guards themselves are in some doubt as to\nthe official time of locking and\nunlocking, and it is never clear\nwhen access to the building is\navailable; often the doors are\nlocked all weekend. Surely to\nprotect the building from\nintruders the doors should be\nlocked at the most likely times\nfor an intrusion: during the\ndaytime when there are few\npeople about. It seems particularly pointless to lock the\ndoors at 7:00pm when they are\nopened at 5:00am. It is often said that locking the\ndoor doesn't really inconvenience visitors, since it's a simple matter to use the internal\ntelephone to call someone to the\ndoor, but anyone who uses this\nargument clearly doesn't appreciate the inherent difficulties. To\n. begin with, it is necessary to find\nan internal phone: itself no easy\ntask when the bar is shut. Then\nyou need the phone number,\nwhich is accessible if you are\ntrying to contact someone in\nFalmouth-Keogh and you know\nhis room number, but the\ninternal phone directory has no\nnumbers for the staircase phones\nin Selkirk or Tizard. Linstead\ndoesn't even have a comprehensive telephone system at all.\nAnd knowing the telephone\nnumber is no help if your friends\nare in the laundry, the television\nlounge, the kitchen, or anywhere\nelse except their room.\nThis is annoying, but there are\nmore serious consequences.\nIrritated by the inconvenience of\nthe security arrangements,\nstudents get round them in two\npotentially dangerous ways.\nThere are doors into Southside which are meant to be\npermanently locked, but can be\nleft open by anyone with access\nto the building. Southside\nresidents often open the doors\nwhen they are expecting visitors;\nas a result the doors are often left\nopen well into the night, when it\nis important to restrict entry.\nSecondly, so many residents\nare aware of the massive inconvenience caused by locking up at\n7:00 that they will gladly allow\nanyone to follow them into the\nbuilding at any hour of the day\nor night. In fact I have even seen\na note left pinned to the door of\nSouthside: 'Dear X, come and\nsee me in room YY Y, if this door\nis locked wait for someone else\nto go in and follow them.'\nSo let's outline some practical\nsuggestions. There is certainly a case for leaving Southside\nunlocked until 11:30pm and not\nopening it until 7:00am, and\nthese times should apply at\nweekends too. There should be a notice on the doors warning\nstudents not to allow strangers\ninto the building, such a sign\nwould not only remind residents\nof the dangers, but would also\nmake it psychologically much\neasier to refuse strangers access.\nAnd finally, there are internal\ntelephones lying idle just inside\nthe doors of Southside. Would\nthe expense be too great to\nmove them outside enabling\nbona fide visitors to phone their\nfriends at any time of the day or\nnight?\nIt is impossible to make a student Hall of Residence\ncompletely secure; but until\nsomething is done about Southside we will be forced to live with\na system which does very little to\nenforce security, and only serves\nto irritate the residents.\nStaff Vacancies\nThere is always room on the\nFELIX staff, especially for\nwriters (see me early in the week)\nand colla tors( just turn up on\nThursday evening), but over the\nChristmas holiday two important\nvacancies have arisen.\nFirstly, since Hugh Southey\nhas been elected Editor of the\nAlternative Prospectus he will be\nunable to continue as What's On\nCoordinator. This job is hard\nwork and needs considerable\ncommitment: the entries have to\nbe sorted and written up early in\nthe week (about an hour's work)\nand then laid out and pasted up\non Tuesday or Wednesday (at\nleast six hours' work\u2014say a whole evening). The job is not\none to be taken on lightly, but\nwill, as they say, provide considerable satisfaction to a reasonably tidy and conscientious worker with a good eye for\nlayout. Anyone interested\nshould see Hugh or me in the\nFELIX Office.\nThe other vacancy is staff\nphotographer, who lias es with\nthe news editor and other\nphotographers and tries to\ncapture the important happenings around IC on film. The\nperks of the job include using all\nthe FELIX photographic equipment (including, when necessary,\nthe Mamiya polaroid camera);\nthe commitment is to spend time\non Wednesday afternoon in the\ndarkroom, developing and\nprinting up to half a dozen films.\nAnyone interested, see me at any\ntime.\nCopy Deadline\nCopy for next Friday's FELIX should be in by Monday 5:30pm, but anything for inclusion in the\nspring term calendar must be in\nby 5:30 today.\nChristmas FELIX\nThere are a few Christmas\nFELICES left (although the free\ngift is not as fresh as it was in\nDecember) and also lots of last\nyear's The Phoenix all available\nfree from the FELIX Office.\nImpossible Without\nall the usual crowd, to wit, Hugh\nSouthey for What's On, Adrian\nJames for news, Lee Paddon,\nNick Bedding and Nigel Brand\nfor reviews, Walkabout-Looksee\nand Gastropod for their respective columns, Pinocchio, Dave Jago, Nick Pyne, Paul\nPhilippou, Peter Rodgers for all\nkinds of help, Chris Mallaband\nfor sport, Maz for typesetting\nand Pete the Printer.\nMartin S Taylor\nFELIX January14,1983 Page 5\n\n"

Still, here are the reasons;\n1. Almost-the longest common word in the\nEnglish language with the letters in strict\nalphabetical order. Our illustrious leader,\nMartin S Taylor, suggested 'Aegilops', a kind\nof grass, but I hardly think that that's common.\n2. Unconsciousness - Oh dear. This was\nsupposed to be the longest word which, when\nwritten in lower case, has nothing projecting\nabove or below the main body of the word.\nUnfortunately, the dot on the i provides as quibble here. A better, equally long contender\nis ou er nervousness.3 Bookkeeper - the longest string of double\nletters in a word.\n4. Wrong - it is. It was meant to be the\nlongest word with the letters coming in reverse\norder, but it is defeated by wronged.\n5. Facetious - the shortest word with all the\nvowels in alphabetical order. Fine, but *y!>s sometimes a vowel, so a better word is\nfacetiously.\nS. Queueing - the word with the largest\nnumber of consecutive vowels.\nDandelion Wine\nCucumber\nBeef Broth\nEgg\nFrench Onion\nGolden Pea\nAsparagus\nHaricot Bean\nThe Prize Puzzles\nScrnfcr's Soup Run\nA wonderful puzzle this, from Perola.

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union LORDS VINDICATE fCU\nHundreds of overseas students could be eligible for refunds of their fees\nand back-dated home student grants from Local Authorities, following\na ruling in the House of Lords last month. The judgement was the\nculmination of a five-year legal battle started by Imperial College\nUnion.\nThe Lords ruled that students\nwho have lived in Great Britain\nfor three years or more (including\nthose who came here on student\nvisas for purely educational\npurposes and have no intention\nof remaining in Britain after\ntheir courses) are eligible for\nLocal Education Authority\ngrants. As a direct consequence,\nit seems certain that these\npeople, who have until now paid\nthe high fees imposed on overseas students, will now be\nentitled to register as home\nstudents, whose fees are considerably lower and paid to the\nuniversities by local authorities.\nIt is reasonable to expect that i he fees paid by the students to t ne colleges will have to be refunded.\nIn addition, the increase in the\nnumber of Home Students\nmeans that College have exceeded the ' Home Student\nQuota' imposed by the Universities Grants Council. This is the\nmaximum number of students\npaying the lower fees that a College may accept in any year;\none thousand and fifty for\nImperial College last year.\nColleges are encouraged to accept\nas many overseas students as\npossible, because their independently paid fees (which have\ndoubled in the last three years)\nare a major source of income to\nthe Department of Education\nand Science. Colleges that\nexceed their home student quota\nface severe financial penalties,\nalthough in the case of Imperial\nand several other colleges which\nMichael Arthur, whose appeal has\nbeen upheld by the Lords.\nhave received preferential\ntreatment as 'centres of ex-cell en ce', these may well be\nwaived.\nThe wording of the 1962\nEducation Act is that students\nwho have been 'Ordinary Resident' in Britain for three years\nare eligible for grants. In\nJanuary of 1978, the Department\nof Education of Science sent a circular to Local Authorities\nsuggesting that people who had\nentered Britain on Student Visas\nto take O and A Levels before\ngoing to universities were not\nordinarily resident because they\nwere here for educational\npurposes only, and many intended to leave the country as\nsoon as they had qualified. Local\nAuthorities took this as an\ninstruction to refuse awards, not\nonly to these people but to\nvirtually all students who did not\nhold a British passport\u2014including one whose father had\nlived in Britain for seventeen\nyears.\nA number of test cases challenging these refusals were taken\nto court, among them one\nbrought by Imperial College\nWelfare Officer Michael Officer\nand Mary Attenborough, then\nICU President, on behalf of\nShahin Bagha, a first-year\nundergraduate in metallurgy.\nFor nearly five years Michael\nArthur and successive presidents\nsaw the cases go through Divisional Courts and Courts of\nAppeal until on December 16 last\nyear the House of Lords ruled\nthat any resident with a settled\npurpose \u2014 including that of\neducation \u2014 is an 'Ordinary\nResident'. In his speech, Lord\nScarman ruled that education is\na settled purpose, and that\nImmigration States and future\nintentions were irrelevant.\ncontinued on page 3\n'But I do stand and count them!'

HPV enthusiasts claim that these\nmachines are more comfortable,\nwarmer and faster over long\ndistances than bicycles\u2014the\nWindcheetah cruises com-fort ably at 3 0 mph. It is\nhoped that the 3,675 mile route\nwill be covered at an average\nspeed of 20mph, taking about\nten days to complete the journey.\nThe team will be divided into\ngroups of four working in eight-hour shifts. The groups will be\nbased in fully-equipped Dormobile-type vans in which they\nwill escort the pedal ler. Three\ngroups of four will cover the first\nfive days of the journey before\nhanding over to another three\ngroups. On top of the part ici pants' expenses, the team hope to\nraise enough money to buy an\nengine for a Brede-class RNLI\nlifeboat. This they will do by\npersonal and industrial sponsor-ship, and by selling the twenty-four square feet of advertising\nspace on the bodyshell.\nAnyone interested in taking\npart in the trip (there are still\nplaces in the team, and the\norganisers claim that you need\nnot be an ultra-fit racing cyclist)\nshould be at the meeting at\n1:30pm on Tuesday January 18\nin Room342, Mechanical Engineering, or contact John\nGilday (Chemistry 3) or anyone\nin the Guilds Union Office.\nJezebel Violated\nTaking it all lying down-the Windcheetah Street Legal Human\nPowered Vehicle without its body (which has yet to be built).\nAhead lamp and a bearing\nbelonging to RCS's motorised\nmascot Jezebel are in the hands of\nQueen Mary College Students'\nUnion.\nThey were stolen on the last\nWednesday of last term, but\nRCS did not discover who was\nresponsible until last Wednesday.\nAccording to Duncan Batty, the\nRCS Motor Club Chairman,\nthree people came to see him at\nJez's Garage where he was\nworking on December 15. Two\nof them pretended to want to\njoin the Motor Club and started\ndiscussing the matter with Mr Batty, while the third disappeared behind Jez and took ahead lamp and a bearing which\nwas being repaired after damage\non Morphy Day. The theft was\nnot discovered until later that\nevening.\nMr Batty revealed that the\nequipment, worth \u00a3600, was\nonly traced when he personally\ntelephoned the President of\nQM CU to find out whether she\nknew anything about it.\nQM CU want to exchange the\nstolen parts for their mascot,\nMary, which was violated by\nRCSU last year. However, Jez is\nnot a violate mascot and QMCU's action is thus against mascot ry rules. Mr Batty has asked\nQM CU to return the missing\nparts and eventually negotiate\nMary's handover with RCSU's Vice-President Fiona Owen.\n'The only ones to suffer are\nthe Motor Club members, as the\nbearing needs repairing and we\nwill not be able to run Jez for at\nleast another couple of weeks,'\nsaid Mr Batty, who has also\nwritten a letter of complaint to\nthe Principal of QM C. Duncan Batty\nFlowers' Powers\nThe Rector of Imperial College,\nLord Flowers, is to lead a two\nyear investigation by a committee of experts into the British\ntown and country planning\nsystem. The inquiry, funded by\nthe Nuffield Foundation, is\nlikely to recommend changes in\nthe system of public inquiries\ninto major building and environmental developments, such as\nthe current controversial inquiry\ninto plans to build a press uri sed water nuclear reactor at Sizewell.\nLord Flowers believes that the\npresent planning system devised\nto deal only with 'little, local\ndifficulties' is in need of reform.\nHe has previously chaired a government commission which\nproduced a major report on\nenvironmental pollution. His\nwork with this new inquiry is not\nlikely to affect his work as\nRector.\ncontinued from front page\nThe effect is that a large\nnumber of students not previously eligible for Local Authority grants now are; in many\ncases, the grant will have to be\nback-dated. These students will\nthen automatically become\nhome students, which will cause\ngreat concern over quotes and\nnext year's admissions. The\ncolleges also have to find a large\nsum of money to return these\nstudents' fees\u2014up to \u00a310,000 per\nstudent for a three year course\u2014\nand no college has easy access to\nthat kind of money. Imperial\nCollege's budget this year is\nofficially described as 'tight',\nFELIX HH IBm and it is by no means certain that\nthe Universities Grants Council\nwill supply the money. The\nRegistrar of the LSE (the college\nmost likely to suffer from this\nruling, and to the heart of the\nUniversity of London) told\nFELIX that neither the UGC nor the University of London\nhad given much scope for\noptimism.\nA spokesman from Senate\nHouse, the administrative centre\nof the University of London,\ntold FELIX that Senate House\nhas been in contact with the\nUGC and DES, and a statement\nfrom these bodies is expected by\nthe end of the month. In the\nmeantime, the Government will\nU anu ary be looking for ways to rewrite\nthe regulations for the award of\ngrants, but unless this can be\ndone without passing through\nthe House of Commons, it will\nprobably be left until after the\nnext General Election.\nImperial College Secretary\nJohn Smith has published a notice stating that no enquiries\ncan be answered on this subject\nat present. Meanwhile, the\nadmissions procedure (normally\nwell underway by January) has\nbeen thrown into confusion until\nsome policy has been reached on\nthe subject of next year's quotas.\nAn interesting feature of this\ncase is that although it was heard\nin the summer, the judgement\n1 4 , 1 9 8 3 BH HH H \u2022was not released until the end of j the Christmas term. The grant\nregulations say that Local Auth- j ori ties are only under an obligation to make an award where a I written application is received\nbefore the end of the student's first term at university.\nThe late publication of the\ndecision means that any student\nwho has not previously applied\nfor a grant will not be eligible. It\nis strongly advised however that\nall students who have not\napplied should do so at once as\nauthorities have a discretion to\nignore this stipulation which, in\nthese extraordinary circumstances they may be minded\u2014or\ncompelled\u2014to do.\n\u2022 HH HH H HI Page 3\n\n"

Out of the\nwreckage sp range the Fun Boy Three who\nquickly became Top of the Pops regulars with\na run of increasingly frivolous singles;\nmeanwhile, Jerry Dammers had crawled off\nwith a couple of Specials, a Bodysnatcher, and\na few others to form the Special AKA. Their\nfirst single, The Boiler, was a chilling account\nof a rape. Predictably, the BBC banned it as\n'distasteful', whereas it was anything but a gratuitous cash-in on the plethora of rape\ncases at the time. Nearly a year later, Capital\nRadio will only play the instrumental B side of\ntheir latest single. IVar Crimes (2-Tone 7\" and\n10\") is 'too political', a haunting lament for the\nvictims of last September's massacre in\nBeirut's refugee camps. Meanwhile, FB3\nrelease their most potent single since\nLunatics. The More I See (The Less J Believe)\nis a tensely orchestrated piece, specifically\nabout Northern Ireland (reminding us that\n'Belfast's only half an hour away') but also\nabout sectarian violence in general, and the\nconsequences for those caught in the\ncrossfire: '...another attack/leaves a widow in\nblack/weeping for her bereaved...And they\nkeep telling me/it's not my concern...' It's out\non Chrysalis as 7\" and 12\".\nAccording to Cherry Red Records boss Iain\nMcNay in the Christmas NME, independant\ncompanies are having a tough time facing up to.\nthe increasingly glossy competition from major\nlabels, as records seem to sell on the strengths\nof a. band's haircuts rather than the music.\nCherry Red seem healthy enough, and to back\nthis up, there's a compilation LP called Pillows\n& Prayers that is fifty minutes long and costs\nonly 99p( echoes of Virgin's samplers for the\nprice of a single that ranged from The Faust\nTapes in the early 70s through The Front Line\nto the recent Cash For Coics). This better-th ah average collection\u2014the sr-j nd track to a forthcoming film and video\u2014features a number 6t recent or forthcoming singles, from\nthe fizzy electronic pop of The Passage with\nXOYO, and Thomas Leer's All About You to\nthe acoustic wanderings of Tracey Thorn's Plain Sailing, and Ben Watt's Some Things\nDon't Matter. Cherry Red have quite a few\nacoustic acts, so it's no surprise to find Kevin\nCoynt here, fitting in well alongside The\nMarine Girls and the Thorh/Watt duo\nEverything But The Girl. As with any\ncompilation, there's a few oddballs: ex-Nightingale Joe Crow, Piero Milesfs excerpt\nfrom Modi-an Italian Mike Oldfield by the\nsound of it; shades of Omma-bleed in dawn,\nand something from Eyeless In Gaza who give\nsynthesis er duos a bad name, and name\nthemselves after an Aldous Huxley novel. One\nabsolute gem is the Monochrome Set's Eine\nSymphonie des Grauens, originally a1979 single on Rough Trade, and included here for\npossibly LW O reasons: firstly, Cherry Red will\nrelease the early singles on a retrospective\nalbum pretty soon, as the Set\u2014surprise,\nsurprise\u2014now record for the label. Secondly,\ntheir new material is crap. The cure nt single is\nsome juvenile cowboy whimsey called Cast A Long Shadow. Last year's Eligible Bachelors\nalbum is being re-promoted (as a film tie-in?),\nbu i this tawdry effort sounds rather dated, like\nIja rly Caravan out-takes in fact; limp 'humour'\npitched at the head rather than at the feet, it\nfalls severely short of its mark. Otherwise, full\nmarks to Cherry Red for a varied roster of\nartists; what with Compact's60 s kitsch,\nFactory's corporate chic, and Rough Trade's^ heer drive, maybe 1983 will see the indies bite\nnu< k. Nigel Brand\nIREVIEWSH\nUninspiring\nLaughter\nDucking Our by Mike Stott, directed bp\nMike Ockrent, Duke of York's Theatre.\nThere are a lot of dotty families about. I don't think anyone can deny this, it's just that\nsome families are more dotty than others. The\nCoppell family, feature in Ducking Out, are\npretty dotty indeed. In fact the family itself is\nalmost a flagrant absurdity. (Good phrase that,\nflagrant absurdity, I must use it again some\ntime). ' .\nThe play is an adaptation by Mike Stott of a play by Eduardo de Filippo called Natale in\nCasa Cupiello (Christmas at the Coppells).\nThe action takes place in the Coppell's flat in\nDerweht Block, the Lakeview Estate, in a town\nin West Lanes, over Christmas Eve, Christmas\nDay and ten days later. One might infer from\nthis that Warren Mitchell as the father of the\nfamily is playing an Alf Garnett type character.\nNot so. Len Coppell is a jovial easy-going\ncatholic. Like Leone Galla in Pirandello's The\nRules' of the Game (played recently by\nLeonard Rossiter), Len has a rock, an anchor\nin life, by means of which he can weather any\nstorm. His anchor is crib making and we find\nhim busy on Christmas Eve labour ing over a huge papier mac he holy crib, a veritable\nmagnum opus. His cribs save him from his\ntroubled, eccentric family, but not for long.\nThings reach a peak on Christmas Day and he\nis confined to bed with a severe speech\nimpediment.\nDucking Out is pure 'sitcom' and although a good laugh it was rather uninspiring. It had\nnothing to differentiate it from other comedies\nd'u u ui eccentric families that one often sees on\nTV. However, superb performances were\ngiven by Warren Mitchell (one of this comedy's most outstanding actors in my opinion) and\nLeslie Sands as Arthur Coppeli, Len's elder\nbut very odd bro the: Nick Bedding\nPS: The-most-obnoxious-person-I have-s at next to-in-the-theatre-in-the-year award was\nconferred upon a neighbour a; the end of the\nperformance of Duckmg Out. An extremely\nhigh accolade, it is not awarded lightly.\nNominees have to be of the highest calibre.\nThe winner was a genuine young bourgeoisie\nupstart (student). Telling his woman how\nmany tens of pounds he had spent on buying\nChristmas presents at Harrods, he was. Half\nclosed eyes. Pouting lips. SpeaKing in that\nrather silly front of mouth manner. Asking his\nfriend what Marcus and Gloria and Jeminia\nand others with those bleed in' bourgeois\nnames were giving him for Christmas.\nObnoxious little turd, theatre critics ought to\nbe afforded seclusion from such people. As if\nthere weren't enough unpleasant and\ndistracting. things in the world like poverty,\nhunger and the FELIX Editor's brown plaid,\ntrousers.\nPage 81\nFlagrant absurdity in 'Ducking Out'\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 January14,1983 Hi IFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nBistro Vino\n1 Old Brompton Road\n589 3888\nOpen every day from noon to 3:00pm and\n6:00pm to midnight\nOf all the restaurants within crawling distance\nof College, the Bistro Vino offers by far the best\nvalue for money if you are eating on a restricted\nbudget.\nAlthough there are several branches in the\narea, I am going to concentrate on the one in\nSouth Kensington\u2014mainly for the very good\nreason that I haven't tried any of the others.\nThe can del it atmosphere\u2014it doesn't quite\naspire to having an ambience\u2014is pleasant.\nThe walls are decorated with racks of wine\nbottles and plastic bunches of grapes are much\nin evidence.\nAs a tribute to its popularity, you often have\nto queue for a table, although if you arrive\nbefore 8:00pm you shouldn't have too much\ndifficulty. On a cautionary note, it isn't really\nsuited to a quiet romantic evening out as\ncouples tend to have to share tables, in rather\nclose proximity, with other diners. If you go in\na larger group, however\u2014say four upwards\u2014\nyou can get your own partitioned off eating\nspace which is far more satisfactory.\nAs should be the case, the best thing about\nthe Bistro Vino is the food. The starters cost\nfrom 70p to \u00a31. Most of them are adventurous\nand well prepared although portions can be on\nthe small side. Mushrooms a la Grecque\u2014\nbutton mushrooms in a ratatouille sauce\u2014is\nworth trying as is the Whitebait\u2014tiny whole\nfish fried in batter. Highly recommended is the\nSmoked Chicken Mayonnaise\u2014delicious.\nMain courses cost from \u00a31.90 to \u00a33.55 and\nare served with your choice of chips,\ncroquettes or rice. Entrecote Steak Diane with\nchips (\u00a33.10) and a side salad (60p) proved an\nexcellent combination. Gigot of Lamb\nRosemary at \u00a32.85 gives you a fair sized piece\nof lamb deliciously flavoured. The Rump Steak\nat \u00a33.45 seemed better value than the Fillet\nSteak at the same price. Their Chicken Kiev at\n\u00a32.85 is an excellent choice for garlic love re. Puddings, priced at 60-70p are uninspiring.\nMy Chocolate Mousse seemed to be\nunnecessarily small although at 65p one can't really complain. The Treacle Tart at 60p and\nthe Cheesecake were also fairly ordinary. The\nbest bet is probably the Bistro Sorbet.\nThe House Wine at \u00a33.50 is no better (or\nwo se) than one would expect.\nService is generally good although the main\ncouse can take its time in coming.\nYou would be hard pushed to spend more\nthan \u00a35 per head on food and service is not\nadded onto the bill.\nAltogether, highly recommended.\nMurder and Suspicion Still of the Night directed by Robert\nBenton, now showing at the Odeon,\nHaymarket.\nDespite the temptation to rest on their ET\nlaurels, UIP have released another very\npassable effort in Still of the Night. Meryl\nStreep and Roy Scheider (star of Jaws-the\none without the teeth) are the main attractions\nof this intricately woven story of murder and\nsuspicion.\nRoy Scheider plays Sam Rice, a psychiatrist\nwho is still reeling from his divorce when a patient of his is murdered (losing your wife is\nbad enough, but losing a patient as well is just\nplain carelessness). The murdered man's mistress, Brooke Reynolds (Meryl Streep)\nturns up at his office and asks Sam to return\nthe deceased's watch to his wife, the violins\nplay and he sweeps her into his arms; well, not\nquite, but Sam's blood pressure moves up a notch or two (and whose wouldn't?). Hard on her heels comes the tenacious\ndetective, Joe Vitucci, with just a suggestion of\nlasagne stuck between his molars. Thje\nevidence points to Brooke, but Sam reckons\nthere are better things you could do with a woman like that than put her behind bars. Can\nhe prove her innocent? Thus the trail of blood\nand corpses continues.\nStill, this is by no means a violent film, and\nthe blood and corpses are kept to a minimum.\nThe main problem with making a film of this\nsort must be generating the sense of tension.\nEven Hitchcock, the master of suspense,\noccasionally failed to deliver, ending up with a rather limp feeling of resignation in the viewer, '\nas he waits for the next thing to go bump in the\nnight. This film uses some cheap tricks, such\nas total silence followed by something hurtling\nin from nowhere. There is also a scene in\nCentral Park; everyone knows that you always\nget mugged in Central Park, which removes\nthe necessity on the director to produce the\ntension. I don't suppose Central Park can be\nreally that bad, but I must admit I have no\ninkling to test this theory at first-hand. On the\nwhole, the atmosphere is well maintained\nthroughout and rivets one's attention to the\nscreen.\nThe climax of the film is well worth waiting\nthe obligatory one and a half hours for with an\nempty seaside retreat being a perfect location\nwith real spook appeal, and there is a clever\nlink between this and a dream sequence earlier\nin the film. When the homicidal maniac is\nrevealed, s/ he (I'm not telling) is fittingly silent\nand menacing; s/ he's out to kill you, not wake\nup the neighbours. The acting is of high\nstandard throughout, with Meryl Streep\noutstanding. As anyone who saw her screen\ndebut in the un mitigating ly awful telly-epic\nHolocaust will tell you, she's at her best when\nbeing alternately terrified, agitated and grief\nstricken; for my money, the best actress on\nthe screen today. This is a very polished and\nrefined film all round. Despite the numerous\nmurders, we are spared the blood and gore\nnormally associated with this sort of goings on,\nthe camera just allowing you time to take in the\nblooded corpse for the instant shock effect\nbefore moving on, and despite the numerous\nsexual liaisons, we are only allowed one all too\nbrief glimpse of Ms Streep in the altogether,\nmore's the pity!\nLee Paddon\nnu xm a mmm mam mmm mmm Record Low Record companies are traditionally at a low\nebb over Christmas, and the New Year\u2014\nmaybe hangovers are particularly heavy in that\nindustry\u2014and this one's no exception; the odd\nnew release jostling with a handful of last year's leftovers for your attention.\nA few singles for starters. Island launch 1983\nwith their latest signing, Glasgow's Set The\nTone. Unfortunately, Dance Sucker isn't too\nhot; join-the-dots funk embellished with too\nmuch synth trickery. Much better are APB\nwho hail from Aberdeen, who have just reissued Shoot You Down (Oily Records); more\nbasic, more direct than Sucker, and all the\nbetter for it. How long before the music press\nhype 1983 as the year of Scottish New Funk?\nIn 1980, Postcard Records of Scotland were\ngoing to set the pop world alight, so we were\ntold, but instead their main bands Josef K, Orange Juice and Aztec Camera had either\nbroken up or dried up by the end of. 1981.\nJosef K recorded a string of sparkling singles,\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 January14,1983 HM H and an underrated LP before splintering, with\nlead singer and Kafka devotee Paul Haig\nretreating to lie low in Belgium. Justice may\nhave been a good single, but his' latest, Blue\nFor You (Interference), is unfortunately a rather monotonous, anaemic disco-ish effort.\nAnd on the subject of bloodless wonders, two\npositively weedy efforts: current John Peel\nfavourites The Farmers Boys sound like fifth-rate Orange Juice, awash with mannered\nvocals and s imp strummed guitars, on More |\nThan A Dream (Backs Records), whilst\n. Darkness & Jive resurrect the ghost of Marc\nBolan on Hooked On Your Love with dire\nresults.\nOn the brighter side the debut single from\nSouthern Death Cult, Fat Man (Situation 2),\ngallops away on some spirited drumming,\npropelled along by twang y guitars straight out\nof Ghost Riders In The Sky. Theatre of Hate\nfans should love it. This week's 'welcome back\nfrom the dead' award goes to Echo and the\nBunnymen; after the unwieldy Back Of Love\nsingle, The Cutter (Korova), is a welcome\nreturn to form, relying in part on those\nthematic hooks that dominate Rescue,\nMonkeys and A Promise, with a great tune\nbuilt around what sounds like an Arabian\n' continued on page 8\n\u2022 BH BB HH BB HH BH BH B Page 7\n\n"
