Mr. Ve all seems to be under the impression that we are\nmounting an anti-Soc.\nSoc. campaign; judging\nby the way he extolled\nthe beauties of socialism in his letter (Felix, 20\nNovember). The aims of christians\nare not to promote any political philosophy,\ncapitalist, communist or\nOtherwise, but to proc la im Jesus Christ in all areas of college life. In\nthe same way Jesus him self was more concern-ed about telling people\nof God than ilea ding them i in war against the Romans, much to the\ndi ^appointment of the Jews. In telling this message the christian needs to be\ninvolved in what 'is going\non around him, one does not want to be\" so heavenly minded as to\nbe no earthly use\". This entails playing a part, to a greater or lesser extent in the Union, and here one expresses one's own ideas about what is\nbest, whatever they may be. Iam sure Mr. Ve all would not discourage\nsuch involvement.\nFinally, I would like\nto comment on Mr. Veall's rather long win ded and philosophical arguments on man's basic rights. If he Wishes to look at man in this pessimistic way, With no economic or social rights\nall right that is up to\nhim. There is one basic\nright however, which man has denied himself,\nthis is the right to eternal life with his creator.\nThat man was created\nwith this right, that he lost it through offending\nGod, and that Jesus died\nso that men might regain\nlife is what the christian\n(who has rediscovered\nthis life) wishes to proc lai m.A very positive\nmessage.\nPhil Win n.Ed' s note: Correspondence on this kind of un scientific level is closed. Turbigo Soc.\nSir,\nWe feel we must protest that here unto for no mention has appeared in\nyour erudite columns of the newly formed Kid ney Turfoigo Society.\nThis lis as adm is demean our on your part,\nand must be remedied\nimmediately.\nFor the information of\nyour 'illustrious readers\nthe first seeds of this unprecedented amalgam ation of kidney connoisseurs were soon in Basil\nStreet S W3on Tuesday\nlast. After but two hours\nit was a thriving organisation of quad ro phonic dimensions.\nTo exemplify our as-pi rations, here is a brief\nsynopsis of the Turfoigoist manifesto: \" . . . we shall not cease our bitter struggle against\nanti-Turbigoism, until the\ndelicious aroma of the\naforesaid savoury delicacy pervades every nook\nand cranny in the civil i sed world( and Neasd en).\" As for forthcoming\nevents, we are currently\nplanning several wine and Turbigo evenings, a series of lectures, films\nand discussions entitled\n\" Tur big ois m Leads the Way\", and, of course,\nour Annual Dinner\n(menu to be published\nlater).\nNow you have got the\nfacts straight, we anticipate your full support.\nYours faithfully,\nYen dik Ogibrut\n(Chairman).\nKidney Turbigo\nSociety Headquarters,\nPrince Consort Road.\nRAILWAY SOCIETY\nTalk by Mr. F. Briggs on The\nSouth Eastern and Chatham\nScene (with slides)\nTues. 4th Dec. 5.40 p.m. M.E.664 All welcome\nStudent Counsellor\nAfter a fairly gentle run-in on a two days a week basis I shall foe taking up the post of Student\nCounsellor full J tl me from December 3 rd. This\nseems as good a time as any therefore to take\nadvantage of the Editor's invitation to introduce\nmyself through these columns. I have just finished five years on the staff of the Watford College of Technology Where besides\ndoing a certain amount of teaching I developed\nand ran a student counselling and welfare service.\nI have worked in the Hospital Service as a Social Worker and, for a period, as an administrator,\nand I graduated at the L.S.E. where I was a\" mature\" student from 1 9 6 1 \u2014 6 6 . Iam married With\ntwo small children. So much for the 'biographical\ndetails.\nWhat is a Student Counsellor? Those of you Who knew my predecessor, Bonney Hartnett, Will\nof course have a fair idea already, but for those\nwho didn't, and for first year students I should perhaps attempt some sort of definition because\nit is far from self-evident. In the U.S.A. Student\nCounselling has been big business for many years\nand some large universities have enormous Co un selling centres staffed by upwards of twenty or\nthirty counsellors, most of Whom would be trained\npsychologists or psychotherapists. In Britain the\ndevelopment of designated counselling services tin\ntertiary education has been much more cautious\nand remains very patchy. There is no real concensus as to what\" Counselling\" is( even in the\ntext books), but two broad truths are evident: \u2014\n(a) There is a growing feeling In the educational\nworld that \" Counselling\" services are a good thing\nto have, and( b) that Counsellors in this country\ntend to take a much more pragmatic approach than\ntheir colleagues in the U.S.A., for example, would consider appropriate.\nMy own stand is roughly this. Everyone in clu ding students, have problems, difficulties and stresses\nof one degree or another in his or her personal\nlife. Nearly always we either resolve them or learn\nto tolerate them as part of the normal fabric of\nour lives, and the idea Of consulting a salaried\n\" helper\" simply does not occur to us. We rightly\nkeep things to ourselves, we mind our own bus i ness. Generally speaking, in other words, we both\nprefer and are able to cope With the contingencies\nof life. It seems equally obvious however that there\nare occasions When our emotional self-sufficiency,\nat least for a time, breaks down, and we become\nto some extent dependent on the support of other\npeople. Bereavement is the most obvious and universal example of such contingencies. The causes\nof such debilitating emotional stress may of course\nbe much less dramatic than that and may indeed\nnot foe very obvious at ali i, but it is precisely In\nthese circumstances that a counsellor may foe use-ful. Ido not suggest for a moment that even in these circumstances the Counsellor is necessarily\nthe best or most appropriate person to turn to, but\nhe is one of the people who may be able to help.\nIn a nutshell counselling Is centrally concerned\nwith helping students to recognise and examine\nproblems which are giving rise to distress, and possibly affecting their work, in such away that\nthey can deal with it for themselves with greater\nconfidence. It may involve meetings over a fairly\nlong period, or the contact may foe quite ephemeral.\nThere is nothing mysterious, sinister or magical\nabout the process.\nIn practise of course 1 frequently see students\njust once \u2014 maybe to give some information ort \u00bb\nsuggest some more appropriate person. In any case the service is strictly confidential.\nIf you would like to talk Ito me my office lis at\nthe Student Health Centre, 1 4 Princes Gardens.\nIam available during normal office hours and can be contacted direct on Internal Number 4205;\nthrough the College main switchboard Extension\n1 8 9 3 ; or through the Health Centre Receptionist,\nI operate an appointment system but Will see any\nstudent Without an appointment on any given day if there is some urgency, though this may entail a short wait.\nDon Ad ling ton\nInternational Students' House\n229 Great Portland Street,\nLondon WI Tel. 636-9471\nThursday, 20th December:\n7.00 p.m. Coffee Party in the bar lounge.\n7.30 p.m. \"Sherlock Holmes\" Aldwych Theatre\nRoyal Shakespeare Company\u2014tickets 35p Friday, 21st December:\n8.00 p.m. Xmas party and disco.

Instead, because of the lack of people, I have now got to start again advertising ANOTHER union meeting to beheld this THURSDAY in the UNION CONCERT HALL, starting at\n1.00 p.m. The agenda is as before with the most important item baling the formation of a TENANTS ASSOCIATION( hopefully). During this week, due to the fact that someone has kindly volunteered to actias Union Publicity Officer, there is a strong possibility that there will be even more publicity than there was last week. If\na large number of people turn up there is an even stronger possibility that this will escalate and attract more people. The reason the same motions turn up everytime is that they are carried over from meeting to meeting because of quorum challenges. If you don't want them to come up everytime, then come to the Union Meeting and either pass or reject them. The sooner we take a decision on them the sooner we can move on to fresh business. Don't forget UNION MEETING THIS THURSDAY IN THE CONCERT HALL. BE IT HALL BASEMENT The college fire officer is very worried about the rubbish being stored in the Be it basement. On inspection With him last week I agreed with him. There lis a large accumulation of rubbish, clothes and other odds and ends that ought to be removed. Therefore( and this5 s mainly directed to those that are actually storing items down there) I have proposed the following:1. If there is anything that you don't want thrown away will you please let me know by Friday,21 st December.2. Wlil'l the owners of the old clothes please arrange for them to be delivered to their ultimate destination.3. All volunteers willing to help clear the area will be most welcome. POSTER STEALERS I have noticed, as have a number of people, that there seems to bear ash of Poster Removing occurring at the present time. The removal of a notice is not' a democratic way of expressing your disagreement with the views expressed by the people who put the poster up in the first place. If you wish to disagree the ngo along to the meeting advertised or write a letter to the people concerned or other such similar actions. This is especially true when posters advertising Union Meetings are removed. By doing this you are depriving someone of b is right to the knowledge that such a meeting exists. ME CH.ENG. REP. Mr. Richard Li.Lo ll eyre signed on the7 th November from the above post. A nomination paper was posted for the required8 college days. When this was removed there was only one nomination, that of Mr. Martin Philo of Mechanical Engineering3. I therefore deem Mr. Philo to be elected. COPULATION IN THE UNION CHAIR STORE At the last Council meeting held on Monday,12 th November it was brought to\nthe attention of the members present that people bad been seen copulating in the Union Chair Store( beneath the stage). Although the discussion at this point was a bit unclear there seemed to\nbe a general consensus that this was not really the right place for It. One of the reasons for this is that it could constitute a fire hazard( sort that one out if you can). Could all those people who regularly use the chair store for copulation therefore cease to do so immediately. UNION LIFT Those of you who regularly use the Union building and especially its facilities on the upper floors may have noticed by now that the lift\nis out of order. The reason for this is simple. Someone( or maybe something) has kindly removed the control plate from inside. The lift is\nan old one and parts are\nhard to come by. Because of\nthis it may he Easter before the lift is baskin operation. I hope that ail you people that have to walk up the stairs several times a week think about this. Maybe one of you somewhere i knows who has the missing item. Just think, three months without a lift in the Union adds up to an awful lot of stair climbing. I'm glad I very rarely have to go above the first level. P.A. WADSWORTH, Hon. Secretary.

NUS Conference, Margate, November 1973\n'Students were \" absolutely mad\" to think rent strikes would force the\nGovernment to pay higher grants,\nLord Annan, a senior member of the\nuniversity 'Chancellor's Committee\nsaid yesterday'.\nThe Telegraph\n'The IC delegation had not really\ngot together before leaving for Mar gate and had no decided policy. The\nsmall contribution made by our delegation was not worth i the \u00a3250\nspent'.\nNorman Sayles\n' We won a \u00a320 grant increase\nWe won a \u00a320 grant increase\nWe won a \u00a320 grant increase!'\nNUS Have a look at our list of delegates,\nwho are John East, Sonia Hochfelder, Alas d hair Campbell, Alf Perry or\nTrevor Phillips representative of\nImperial College opinion? Perhaps\nDave Sinclair can be considered to\nbe the true representative of IC; I never heard him come out strongly\non any point! The Delegation was picked mainly from the minority of\npeople who take an interest in Union affairs and make sure people hear\ntheir left wing policies. However our\nmodest contribution itself helped\nmake up the silent majority at Mar gate. The atmosphere at the conference and the views put forward can\nnow be arrived at with a little stretch\nof the imagination. Attending the conference and listening to the over\nemotional speeches and debates, one\ngets the impression that students are\nready to leave all and join in a massive uprising to 'destroy the unjust\ncapitalist system and all its evils this\nmoment. One returns to College, impatiently awaiting the Union General\nmeeting when the results of four\ndays of hard work will be put to the\ncollege, only to find that the few Who\ndo turn up are not particularly impressed by What they are supposed to\nhave voted for! Was it worth going\nthrough all the discussions and making all the resolutions? As the NUS never tire of saying, there was a \u00a320\nincrease in grants last year!\nEven accepting the fact that students are not going to be wildly enthusiastic about what conference\ndecides, there is still something to be\nsaid for ft. ft gives people a chance to\nexpress their views freely and see\nbow democracy does nd t work on a large scale! After the real work has\nbeen done by the compositing meetings in deciding upon the form the\n(motion and its amendments are to\nta1<e nothing remains to be done but\nfor the crude demagogues to polarize\nthe arguments completely and whip up people's fears and emotions.\nNapoleon's sheep then start bleating\nand a decision is made depending on\nhow far the delegates' emotions have\nbeen touched. The conference tries\nto be democratic in its procedure, but\nis tangled up in its own mesh of laws and standing orders. Countless challenges are made to the chair and hours are spent sorting out the pro-ce dure. The longest wrangle at the\nlast conference took a Whole hour to\nsort out. 1 will give a short description of what happened.\n1 Vote on a certain amendment \u2014\nresult close.\n2 Count \u2014 3 4 1 for, 3 1 3 against.\n3 Call for card vote (delegation vote\nwritten on card).\n4 Chairman' s refusal.\n5 Challenge to chairman's ruling.\n6 Vote on challenge close.\n7 Count:229 for, 2 6 6 against, 7 ab-stent ions. Chairman' s ruling overruled.\n8 (Card vote on amendment.\nThe Other challenges took anything\nfrom 10 to 4 5 minutes to resolve and1 have lost track of the number of\npo'nts of order raised. When conference did get down to debating, the\ntime allowed for speeches was H to\n2 minutes. There was no time to\nargue points logically, so the speakers\nhad t~> rely on the immediate emotional appeal of their speeches and usually run through the well repeated\npolicy of their particular party. Is it\ndemocratic to get bogged down in\nbureaucracy and vote on motions\nwithout having the time to discuss them in any detail, and what good are our ideal, democratic resolutions\nif we cannot enforce them? Perhaps\nthese conferences are the ideal training grounds for our future politicians\nWho want to learn how decisions\nshould be made! Our Journey\nIf the IC delegation was not representative of IC, it certainly was very\nrepresentative of our left wing groups!\nIn our little van we had the most\nmilitant members of the International\nMarxist Group, the workers revolutionary party, and the communist\nparty. It was inevitable that everyone\nshould try to make his own opinion\nheard, as the only opinion worthy of\nthe 4iC delegation and within a very\nshort time battles had been waged over all the burning topics. Needless\nto say, no one changed his mind, learned anything or even listened very\ncarefully. Attention soon wandered to\ntwo O Level students, the delegates\nfrom Paddington College of Further\nEducation, Who were getting a lift\nfrom us. They seemed to show great\nrespect and awe for these important\nsounding students and tried their best\nto learn everything! Other more sensible members of the delegation turned to the (two French institute girls in\nthe van. Piers Corbyn's neighbour was\nsoon Observed to be snoring away,\nwhile 'the other carried on with her\nbook. Fortunately for us Norm didn't pay much attention to all the uproar,\nand steadily drove on to Margate.\nOnce at Margate everyone rushed\noff to the compositing meetings on\nthe subject they were most interested\nin. A compositing meeting is where\nthe real work is done. Out of the\nnumerous motions and amendments, the most effective are selected and the line of attack decided upon. The\nexact wording of amendments, the\nbest psychological t, me of day to\nforward them and the proposer s have\nto be decided upon. Not be.ng a political animal I chose the gay soc com positing meet ng. The great grievance\nwith gay soc seemed to be Steve\nParry's behaviour at the summer Festival of Youth in Berl.n. He had not\nthought the cause of gay soc relevant\nto the delegation pol.cy, was alleged\nto 'nave struck Peter Tatchell, the\ngay soc member, and torn his placard\nsaying ' Gay soc supports socialism'. The great point to decide upon was whether to censure Steve, ask for a removal of his international responsibilities, or his resignation. No one\nseemed to be concerned with the\nfuture of Gay soc and( its develop-ment s.Well, as ' All' said 'People will be bitchy I' Conference began at 7.30 with\nJohn Randall, the'President's address.\nThe following excerpt will give an idea of John Randall's speech and his\nconference.\n\" As our campaign gathers strength\nwe hear again the old cry that students are a privileged elite and should\nbe grateful for their pittance. This is\nan argument that we have encountered many times in the past, but it\nhas a sinister undertone to it that is worthy of careful examination. If edu cation is seen as a privilege and not\nas a right then what is the position\nof those who do not form the elite\ngroup, in a complex modern society\na major constraint upon democracy is\nthe inability of the ordinary person to\nChallenge decisions of Government,\nsupposedly taken on highly technical\ngrounds, as well as those decisions\nthat are raised in a more straightforward manner on basic political\nprinciples. To deny access to education to substantial sections of the\ncommunity is to negate the spirit of\ndemocracy. But it is not surprising\nthat this (Government is not greatly\ninterested in having an educated and\ninformed electorate. We have seen\nit raise council house rents, and claim to have done so in the interests of\ntenants. We have seen it champion the cause of industrial democracy by\nseeking to smash the trade unions.\nWe( have seen it claim that rising\nprices are part of a programme to\ncurb inflation. We have heard it promoting peace, whilst selling arms to\nPortugal. We have seen it uphold\ndemocracy by heading the rush to\nrecognise the fascist junta in Chile.\nWe have heard it describe the biggest trade deficit in history as a problem of success and we have watched it expand education by slowing the\nrate of growth. Such a Government\nwould hardly wish its electorate to\nsee its catalogue of hypocrisy for what\nit is. To deny that education is a right\nof all is to foster the myth of the in fallible and omnipotent government\nand is to devalue and debase demo-c racy\". Reports and Frolics\nAfter the address came a lot of\nboring events like Minutes, Ratification of Policy, Reports, Announcements, Business 'and 'more Reports.\nI took the opportunity to go round to\nthe back of the hall where all imaginable groups like liberal students,\nGaysoc, Palestinians, Greeks, Health\nstudents, NUS and of course all factions of the left had stalls and were selling books and publications. One\ncould have arguments along any lines\nwith the attendants who seemed to\nhave nothing better to do than defend their beliefs. The bar was always\nfull and the coffee 'bar was kept busy\nselling cups of coffee for Bp whenever\nit was open. Given a choice 1 would have spent all my time in the compositing meetings and with the people\nWho really got things done, but Norman seemed to think that a Felix reporter who did not attend the conference full time (9.00 a.m. \u2014 1 2 noon)\nwas not worth his bread, so from then\non I spent my time dutifully sitting\nWith Norm( often with all other delegates elsewhere attending to th<\nown interests) ticking the mo tic and amendments as they were car-ried, defeated or deleted.\nAs conference did not end un^ l midnight, all social activities had to\nbe postponed to the early hours of\nthe morning. The bar in our hotel was\npacked until about 5 a.m. and the\nboard left meeting arranged on Friday went on until 3. There was great\nuproar over this meeting as the IMG were not allowed, so Piers of course\ntried to break in without much success. A door was torn down in the\nprocess I believe! Discos and parties\nwere also arranged on all the nights.\nOn Sunday the hotel bar was taken\nover completely by our over strained, drunk revolutionary friends. The\nbeauty of the expression on their\nfaces as they cried Revolution! Revolution! could only be appreciated by\nan outside observer as he fought his way through them! The next morning\nI was confronted by the havoc they\nhad caused. All the lace curtains had been pulled down, and there were broken bottles and cigarette ends\neverywhere.\nPiers Corbyn I am told slept on a borrowed bed stuck halfway into a cupboard. He invited six other of his friends to share the hospitality of the\ntwo original inhabitants of the room! Grants\nThe National Union of Students has\ncalled for a national rent strike from\nJanuary 1st in support of all demands in the grants campaign. Negotiations\nwere called futile and the NUS will\nwithdraw from talks with the D.E.S. after the first stage of the Triennial\nReview procedure.\nUnity of policy and action was tha\nmain point decided upon at the con-ference. A national rent strike encourages all colleges to participate, has\ngreater impact, and makes victim is ation difficult. The equal priority given\nto all demands ensures the involvement of a large body of students.\nThe disinterested ness of university\nstudents in the discretionary awards,\nthe first demand in the grants campaign, was blamed for last year's fail-ure s. A motion of censure was passed\non the executive for their handling of\nthe campaign and for their lack of\nleadership over the November 14\nwork in.\nAlthough Imperial College was one\nof the proposer s of the grants motion,\nit abstained over the vote because of\nthe call for a national rent strike. The\nunion policy of local action is apparent from the way in which the decision over the rent strike has been left\nto individual Halls and student\nhouses. Cont. on pa qe8 Continued from page 2\nDERELICT CARS From time to time,\ncars are abandoned on the College campus, where they rapidly bec ome derelict and attract the attentions of\npersons who cannibal is e them for spare parts.\nEventually they are disposed of at considerable\ncost to the College.

The day when to travel by air one may have to cross the Atlantic, all\ninternal flights having been replaced by high' speed surface transport, is\nnot so distant as politicians and \u2022 economists would like to believe.\nThis is the view of Professor Eric\nLaithwaite, Head of the Imperial\nCollege Heavy Electrical Department and champion of linear motor\nresearch and development as the\nonly contending solution to this\nproblem in Britain today.\nIn 1948, Professor Laithwaite resurrected the concept of a motor that\nessentially is an unrolled and extend ed version of the rotary electrical motor commonly known to us today.\nProducing straight line motion with\nno moving parts, cranks or gears,\nrecords show that the Mayor of\nPittsburg constructed a linear\nmotor as far back as 1890! Thirty\nyears after preliminary models were\nb jilt at Manchester University, Professor Laithwaite and his fellow re-searchers, have produced an entirely revolutionary concept in surface travel based on their \" single sided transverse flux linear motor.\" The system copes with every facet\nof a future high speed transport net-work; propulsion is produced with\nno mechanical or electrical connections and therefore very little f ric tion, levitation is produced by magnetic suspension, braking is an integral part of the propulsion unit and the system is self guiding. When compared with alternative schemes underdevelopment employing wheels on rails, and hover cushions for suspension with even air-screws\nand rockets for propulsion, it came as a major surprise when plans to\nclose the project test site at Earith,\nCambridgeshire were announced early this year.\nExport\nThe reason behind this decision seems ill-defined but rests on one\nexplanation by the Minister for Aeros pace and Shipping, Mr. Heseltine,\nthat the conceived linear motor train\nservice, giving speeds of 300 m.p.h. on main line routes, offered \". . . no\ncommercial use for 'that vehicle' in\nthe United Kingdom within the next\nfifteen years.\" The Minister not only\nseemed unwilling to forecast what\nBritain's transport needs would be\nafter that period but did not refer to\nthe one field that most suited the\nlinear motored system service char-act eris tic: export.\nWhat this system offered in export\npotential was the opportunity of selling a British system to link up Western Europe before rival projects under study in other European co un tries reach the stage of perfection\nto offer viable alternatives.\nWhen Mr. Marsh, Head of British\nRail said in 1972 \" We know an awful\nlot about wheels and a lot about\ntrack and track maintenance... a rather better proposition than banking on something about which we know virtually nothing,\" he avoided the more likely stumbling block to\nthe scheme. Recently the Head of\nBritish Rail's research and development division, Dr. Sydney Jones, put\nhis finger nearer to the truth when he\nstated that restrictions on high speed trains do not lie in the technological difficulties alone. The main problem was to build faster trains that could cope with the excessive curving of\nindustrial waste bin\nexisting rail tracks. Whilst British\nRail development seeks to work\nwithin the confines of present fac ili ties, by definition, a linear-motored\ntrain would involve colossal expend i ture in track replacement, essentially\nalong identical routes. Although\" wheels on rails\" trains would benefit from a track straightening prog ram me, they are consent to live\nwithin the present restrictions, so\noffering a far cheaper short term in-vestment.\nWaste bin And so five and a quarter million\npounds and thirty years of research and development were c cn~:g ned to\nths industrial waste bin in February\nese have started constructing a system they must soon find to be far\ntoo costly to be practicable. Nevertheless, in the light of the new, closer Europe, high-speed surface transport must come to fruition before the\nturn of the century. Despite their\ntemporary setback, the British team\ncome out in a far stronger position\nthan could be predicted, simply due\nto a series of patent and licensing shields that will effectively give their\ncompetitors no option but to seek\nto buy manufacturing rights. Again this has been achieved not by the\ngrand researches at the Earith test\ntrack but by radical thought, a little\nluck, hard graft and years of experience by the researchers working at\nProfessor Eric Laithwaite behind a tracked hovercraft display model\n(picture by courtesy of Malcolm McNeill, Daily Mirror).\nthis year. The project had always been fighting for money, formerly\nfrom the restricted pockets of the\nNational Research and Development\nCorporation. This body, whose total\nresources are limited to a borrowing ceiling of fifty million pounds, is totally inadequate to spawn the four\nhundred or so projects it has to investigate every year. Whilst the British site at Earith was closing its\ngates, its German counterpart,\nKrauss-Maffei, already having spent\ntwelve million pounds, was eagerly\nwaiting to snap up the know-how and personnel so suddenly flooding the\nmarket. Krauss-Maffei hired ten of\nthe Earith technical staff, all of whom turned out to be mechanical engineers not directly concerned with the\nelectrical theory involved.\nHigh-speed\nIt was here that almost everyone\nmade a colossal oversight. Today in\nthe basement of Imperial College Electrical Engineering block, lie all\nthe accumulated refinements and guts of a perfected system, only\nwaiting for a customer to promote\nits application. At present, Germany, France, Japan and the U.S.A. run\nsimilar projects in high speed trans-port. None of them have achieved the lead gained at Imperial College despite nine months having elapsed since Ear it h's closure. Concern must\nbe gripping the Germans as their exp eri ment s prove to be more and more expensive at higher speeds,\nproving true predictions Professor\nLaithwaite made in the past. Their\nclients, the Ontario Government, have accordingly become worried as\nexemplified by Atlantic telephone\ncall to verify the rumours with Professor Laithwaite. The French, led\nby M. Bertin, until recently employed an air-screw for propulsion instead of a linear motor, whilst the Japan Imperial College Electrical Engineering Department.\nOne major problem in track development has been the const ruc tion of a suitable electro-magnetic\njoint to connect aluminium sections of the base-plate. The Americans attempted aluminium welding to form\na continuous track as used in conventional steel tracks. On the first\ncold night the rail was ruined by\nsevere cracking. Professor Laithwaite'steam have perfected an\nelectro-magnetic connection which allows for an expansion gap between rails of up to one inch without a resulting power loss. The theory behind this is so basic that it\nis held no alternative answer will be\nfound, again leaving Britain with the\nupper hand through patenting proc edu res. But why is it that foreign\ncompanies can afford to sponsor investment whilst Britain, with solutions at hand, cannot effectively\nutilise them? Politics\nAll indications show that remounting interest in the research prog ram me may cause a modified\nEarith site to reopen. Under the\nprevious scheme, a three mile long test track was envisaged, mounting a high flood bank at the latter stage\nof the third mile. It was the sinking\nof costly piles to support this incline\nthat sapped so much of the finance.\nNow, building only as far as the base of the embankment, a two and a half\ntrack is planned for construction on\na greatly reduced budget. The scale of the test vehicle is not always appreciated, being sixty feet long,\nthe height of three men and crammed full of electronic telemetry\nequipment transferred directly from\nthe Harrier jump-jet enabling survey-ance of the vehicle's performance. During a visit prior to closure, the\nMinister of Transport, Mr. Peyton,\nmade an odd comment, saying that\nobviously the Advanced Passenger Train was further than Tracked Hovercraft, for it (the APT) contained seats. This was either an off-the-cuff\ncomment of an ill-informed administrator or that of a shrewd man; Professor Laithwaite's philosophy for\nyears has been that to sell a scheme you must take the part of a fair man and give rides.\nInevitably, to sell the merits of the\nsystem, Professor Laithwaite has been forced to enter the borderlands of politics, becoming as he prefers\nthe term, a technical\" diplomat\". In\nthis role he hopes to achieve one of\nthree possible stages for future in-vestment.\nFirstly and at present the only\noperable choice, is to sell patenting\nrights to competing investors and live on the profits of the know-how\nalone. Preferably and most likely,\nBritain will manage to reach the\nproduction stage of all rolling stock\nbut track construction will be undertaken by a consortium large enough and with sufficient nerve to venture\nraising the enormous capital investment necessary. Almost inevitably it\nseems this consortium will be based in Germany. Finally. British commercial concerns could be responsible for construction of all stages of the\nproject though this is almost certain\nly a non-starter for the reasons cited\nin stage two.\nPrecipice\nA saman born in Lancashire, Professor Laithwaite remembers the\ndays of depression when a declining textile industry threw people of all\nclasses into despair and poverty..\nWhilst the new machinery of the\nnineteenth century produced the\nhey-day of the cotton industry, complacency had set in concerning any\nneed to allow for further develop-ment.\nAnd so, while contentment\nreigned, the raw-material producing countries simply built on borrowed experience and carried away the\ngolden egg. In Professor Laithwaite's view, Britain' s technical efforts stand on this precipice again. It would be tragic to see another industry die in so similar a manner by the end of this century or sooner.\nWith this in mind, Professor Laithwaite has increasingly combined his\nacademic role with that of town crier. In his own words, to tell the\nworld that you have something worth\nlooking at is guaranteed no attention.\nTo get on the biggest orange box\naround and shout we've the greatest,\nthe fastest, the cheapest, the best\npossible conceivable in the whole of\ncreation, stands you a chance of\nsomeone taking a cautious glimpse at what you are peddling. To lend his point more appeal he often summarizes with a quote from W.S. Gilbert.\nIf you wish in this world to\nadvance your powers you're bound to\nenhance. You must shout it and stump it,\nAnd blow your own trumpet.\nOr trust me, you haven'ta chance. A.Z. STOP PRESS\nIn keeping with its policy of faith\nin the existing rail network, the Government yesterday committed itself\nto a \u00a3891m. investment plan over\nthe next five years to be spent on im proving rather than expanding present\nservices and guaranteeing the continuation of the APT project.\nNov. 29th,'73 A.Z.

ISSUE No.349 Union meeting\n1.00p.m. Thursday, 6th Dec,\nUnion Concert Hall\nNUS CALLS\nNATIONAL RENT STRIKE\nWhy the hell should\nwe go on a rent strike?\nBY NORM SAYLE SIam writing this article in an attempt to clear up some points of confusion in many people's minds about the aims and the realities of aRent Strike in Imperial College. For those300 or so of you who were at the Union Meeting last\nThursday, I don't wish to bore you with this article as Is hall be reiterating many of the points which I made in my speech at the meeting. For the other3,900 people in College, though, I hope my thoughts will be of some importance. To begin with, I must dispel the misapprehension in many people's minds that the aim of the Rent Strike is an attempt to\" force\" the College to reduce the rents in Halls and Houses. This would be a ridiculous move since our rents area slow as they could possibly be and they obviously do not need to be made any lower. In a nutshell, the Rent Strike has been called as a\" reasonable Way of expressing our views about the Grants' system as it stands at the moment\"( to use a phrase of Sir Br la in' s speech on Com mem. Day!). You may say to yourself:\" But what is wrong with the Grants' system?\" f get \u00a3520 each year and I can make that last me the whole30 week session.\" I can assure you, however, that if you are truly able to say this, then you are one of the very few members of this College on a full grant. The MAJORITY of our U.G. Students are MEANS TESTED Le. their grant is assessed on their parents' income and if the parents earn more than \u00a3 1 5 0 0 per year, the student's grant is drastically cut. This has several consequences, some of which areas follows: \u2014\n(1) Students, who are above the age or majority(18), a rest H'l dependent to a very great extent on their parents and as such are very restricted in the way they spend their< jr a rti:.\nt2) Many parents are assessed on a previous year's salary and have, since the time of assessment suffered a serious depreciation> \u2014 owing to one cause or another \u2014 in their wage, and therefore, cannot afford to pay the student the correct amount of money which is required to provide a full i \u00a3 5 2 0 ) grant.(3) Many parents refuse to pay their contribution to the grant as they do not agree with the way their child is running his/ tier life.(4) Many parents decide to use their contribution to pay for their child to stay at home during the vacations or to pay for some clothes when the student is at home, or other sundries such as these. Is peak from personal experience as someone who received a full grant during my three years in College but whose parents were only too happy to pay for these additional items. I reckon that I ended up with about \u00a3670 per year instead of \u00a3520 and this is where the Means Tested student is losing out again. From my comments on the Means Test, I think that most people would regard it as totally unjust to both students and parents. What we are calling for is a FULL grant for ALL and that the money obtained by the Government by Means Testing be recouped by a minor adjustment in the taxation system so that the money may foe got from the parents in tints way. If we now goon to look at the Other anomalies in the Grants' system which only as far as l.C. is concerned, r elate to\" minority groups\" in comparison to the widespread effect of the Means Test, we can recognise the following: \u2014\n(1) DISCRETIONARY AWARDS. This is away in which the LEA's can decide to give a student' a grant or not depending upon their own whims. It seems to make no difference whether the educational establishment is recognised by the Government or not. It also applies to those students who find it necessary to do are s it year. Even if the particular college recognised that the student had some peculiar difficulty the previous year and has a right to repeat the year, he is not entitled to a grant but, in general, te expected to support himself for the year. This problem is particularly acute in Further Education and Art colleges and, therefore, has a drastic effect upon a large proportion of the students of this country.(2) MARRIED WOMEN'S GRANTS. Here we have the situation where a female student who gets married to an on student, automatically has her grant cut by something in# ie region of \u00a3 1 5 0 to \u00a3200. In this way, a married student can find herself having to survive on a grant of around At the NUS conference in Margate, two\nweekends ago, a motion calling for a national rent strike, as opposed to local\nor partial ones, was easily passed.\nHot opposition was expected and received from\nthe NUS executive over this motion, as they had been attempting to de central is e the campaign, A censure motion was carried on the Exec, over\nnegating their role as the leadership of the NUS. this question referring primarily to their absence of\nleadership in the Nov.7 th march and abortive\nNov. 14th work-in.\nExec, attempted to postpone discussion on the\ngrants campaign and Chile, two politically very\ncontentious topics, by introducing hordes of international and emergency speakers and stretching\nout discussion of Steve Parry's Berlin poster-rip-ping antics to a phenomenal 4 i hours.\nFull conference report on page 5.\n\u00a3295. In the case of a male student who marries, this discrimination does pot occur. It is quite con cie v able that a student whose Wife is earning \u00a32,000 is receiving \u00a3520\nwhereas a female student whose husband is earning \u00a31600\ngets only \u00a3295. It must be agreed that this is an unjust and intolerable situation.(3) Postgraduate awards \u2014 These awards do affect a great number of the students of this college, and as such will probably be of great interest. In brief, as an undergraduate, a person is getting about \u00a315 per week to live on during term time, but once he becomes qualified, more mature, and also gains more responsibility as a postgraduate, his grant is slashed from \u00a3 1 5 per week to a paltry \u00a313.40 per week. In anyone' s books this is no less than an insult to the amount of study which the person has already done during his time in college. Another very real problem With the postgraduate grant for London scholars is that there is absolutely no weighting to account for the fact that the person will have to pay an Increase of about50 percent on food prices overall,100 percent increase in travelling, and also about100 percent increase in the cost of accommodation. Although t ne Undergraduate sum of \u00a3 4 0 does not go very far in this\npresent day and age, at least it shows that the D.E.S. have put some thought into the way in which they assess the Undergraduate grant, whereas this thought seems to be lacking from the Postgraduates. The final, or atleast another of the major anomalies of the Grants awarding system which I would like to draw your attention to is the same one as the Rector mentioned in his speech on Commemoration day, ie. the fact that the basic undergraduate grant is at present atleast \u00a3 1 0 0 less than it should be.I realise that many of us have survived on this basic grant for the past few years, but Iam sure that we would all admit that an increase of \u00a3 1 0 0 in the Grant which we receive would Improve our standard of living to put us more towards that frame of mind which is conducive to work. It is interesting to note that even Sir Brian suggested that this increase Would put us back to the level at which the grant was in1962. All the above are reasons why I think that YOU should support OUR Rent Strike. You may ask\" Why aRent Strike in support of a Grants campaign??\" Well, I will tell you. This Rent Strike which will be controlled by the students in residence themselves, is one of the only ways in which a large majority of our students can show what they feel about the Grants campaign. This expression of our feelings Will both be meaningful, and also will be a means of campaigning without directly affecting the college. I have been told that provided the residents give over the money to the college as soon as the Rent Strike is over then the college will feel very little adverse effect. From a close examination of the Constitutions which have been drawn up of the Tenants Association and also the Rent strike fund, lit lis obvious that the people who will be controlling the money are the people who actually live in the residence, and no minority groups be they rightwing or left wing will in anyway foe able to influence the decisions of the Rent strike Tenants Association. The reason that the control MUST stay in the hands of the Strikers is so that NOONE can tell them what to do, and when they decide that they want to call off the strike then they will be at perfect liberty to do so. It has been said that the D.E.S. already knows what the students of this country really do think about( the Grants system, and that nothing which we can do will change what they think one bit. But the point is that Imperial College has NEVER taken any kind of successful action on the problem of Grants, and thus successful action of this type would have an even greater effect than if we had been doing this type of thing every week for the past two years. Sir Brian has asked us to make our actions reasonable and also sensible, and this is I think exactly what we are doing in this case, and I would hope that Sir Brian sees it as such. What I hope to do once the Rent Strike has begun is to write to Sir Brian asking him to send a letter to Mrs. Thatcher in the D.E.S. asking her to explain the inadequacies as we see Itfoem, and asking her what actions he is proposing to take during the coming session. Hopefully with the bac king of the Union behind htm, then the action which Sir Brian may take could possibly have a greater effect upon the decisions made by the D.E.S. There are obviously many more, questions which need to be answered about the rent strike, either to clarify what is happening or to merely try to pull the whole thing to pieces. May I suggest that if you have any specific questions, could you please address them to either T rev Phillips or tome, and t f( there is sufficient interest in any of the Hall's or houses, either one way or the other, then you could perhaps try to get your Warden or one of the sub wardens to arrange a meeting of the Hall/ House residents either towards the end of this term or at the beginning of next term, or even both if you like, to which we could come along and try to clarify any points which you want to raise. PLEASE support the rent strike, as the only way in which ft can be made to be anything of a success is to get everyone in on it. If only a few people come out on strike, then it is not worth having, but if the majority support the strike, then we have a good chance of airing our views, and doing our bit to try and put the Grants system back on the road Which1am sure it was originally designed to follow. SUPPORT THE RENT STRIKE/ SUPPORT THE GRANTS CAMPAIGN. IT'S EASY? IT HARMS NOONE? if MERELY MAKES A POINT VERY CLEARLY. Please help us to help you. SOC soc\ncalls for mass UGMS.\nSir, \u2014 1 would like to correct certain factions\nof stu Went s who are suggesting that Soc.S oc. wants in quo rate unrepresentative UG M's to manoeuvre the meeting to\ntheir own advantage.\nThese people are creating a general feeling\nthat the union is simply a platform for the left\nwing in IC. Please note\nthat two members of\nSoc. Soc. were responsible for distributing\nleaflets, advertising the\nlast U GM through the\nphysics departments and refectories, in an effort\nto get people to come along and express their\nopinion.\nWhat any union wants\nto achieve is to get students to turn up to UG M's to provide a basis for constructive\ncriticism of any motion\nput forward and to aim for a better understanding of the issues involved, to get a broader\nfoundation for initiating\nan improvement in student life in its widest\ncontext. Those ideas are in totality parallel to the\naim of Soc.S oc. and isn't this what' every\nstudent wants the union\nto be? Any member of the\nunion can put forward a motion, this motion b eing accepted at the discretion of the chairman.\nI hope that many more\npeople attend the UG M's in future to vote\non the issues which are of very important relevance to their life in this\ncollege.\nJ.D.

Hence\nout of the actual social experience of his existing\nlevel of consciousness man projects this fantastic\nrelationship with supernatural beings because he\ncannot understand his existing relationship with society and nature, i.e. RELIGION IS FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS. Religion gives consolation to individuals but\ngives a false purpose to man when the actual\nmaterial relations of society are not understood.\nHence religion does not have an independent existence from the rest of the social and economic relations\u2014that is when social relations change,\nreligious beliefs change. The rise of Christianity\nwith the fall of the Roman Empire, Catholicism arose with feudalism (the marach ical structure of\nthe catholic church along with its ideology reflect\nthe feudal social relations), protestantism arose\nwith the evolution of capitalism, Islam with the\nAsiatic mode of production, primitive religions in\nIndia reflect the local tribal form of production \u2014\nTHAT IS RELIGION CORRESPONDS TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE. The key to understanding the Arab-Israeli conflict\nflows not from the religious differences (Jews have\nlived in harmony with the Arab Palestinian for hundreds of year), the religious differences only reflect\nthe conflicting economic interests in the Middle East particularly America and West Europe's interest in \" safeguarding\" their oil resources. In\nNorthern Ireland likewise the two religions reflect\nmaterial interests the Protestants having certain ad vantages over the Catholics see the demand for\ncivil rights as posing a threat to their meagre privileges. Both American imperialism in the Middle East and British imperialism in Ireland play on the\nreligious differences to encourage the deepening\nof the divisions among the masses so that no real\nthreat is posed to their domination.\nReligious practise is not 'a public expression of\na persons beliefs' (A. Syro p's interpretation of re-li gion) but an institution of the state in imposing\nthe beliefs of the ruling class on the masses. Under\nfeudalism the aristocracy used the Catholic Church to impose the beliefs of the aristocrats on the peasants and serfs. Under capitalism the capitalist\nclass likewise use the church( Protestant) to im pose its beliefs on the working class, e.g. Calvinism preaches that workers should work harder (so\nthat the employers can make more profit). Hitler recognised the role of the church very well, one of\nhis first acts on coming to power was to strengthen the hand of the church, so as to strengthen the\nstate in imposing the beliefs of the capitalist class on the working class. Religion is used as the opium of the masses \u2014 it covers the chains that harness\nthe oppressed with flowers. It is in this sense that\nonly private expression of religious beliefs should be allowed, religious institutions should be smashed alongside all the other institutions of the bourgeois\nstate.\nAs man gains an understanding of his relationships to nature the need for religion is eroded away. After a socialist revolution he should be able)\nto practise his religion if he still feels the need but religion should not be used as a repressive institution against the masses.\nIt is a pity that Syrop has to rest ort to mum foo jumbo rather than answer the question that if\nMaurice Maloney, A. Syrop, D. James and other\nGod Soc. people serious about the concern and freedom then they would support the campaign for\nthe release of Ivan Dzyuba and Vyacheslov Chor nou il, two Rus is an socialists from prison. Amongst other campaigns they should support would be\nfight the fight again t racism and particularly against\nthe National Front. The conclusion which must be drawn is their superficiality of their so called ' concern' for their fellow men. Even the church conn-mission( an institution of the state which invests\nthe church's money in the property market) showed whose side it is on last week when it sent 2 5\nbailiffs and 5 0 police round to their properties in Formosa Street, North Kensington and threw the\noccupants into the street. The net result an extra\n2 0 homeless.\nJOCK VEAL U Ed's note: Ivan Dzyuba has been released from prison, claimed the Ukrainian Writers Union on tha9t h November.\nINTERACTION launch new community bus\nscheme: \"no set hire charge\"\nInter-Action Trust, the\nKentish Town community arts group, has announced their latest project.\nAnother double-decker\nbus will join the Trust's fleet of buses which bring resources to where they are most needed in\nthe community.

There is no\nset hire charge, although the Trust reckons\nthat donations will be required to keep the bus\nrunning.\nEd Berman, director\nof Inter-Action, commented on the problem of\ncommunity transport:\n\" We have had literally\nhundreds of requests\nfrom groups over the\nyears for transport facilities. Previously we\ncould fulfil these requests only occasionally,\nbecause of our lack of\nresources. Since this\nnew bus was donated,\nwe hope it will answer\na lot more of the need.\nCommercial buses are\ntoo expensive for community groups. Donations of about half the\ncommercial costs would enable us to run the bus\nproperly.\n\" We hope that someday an action group\nor federation of groups\nin Camden will form to\ntake over the ownership\nand responsibility of this\nbus and others like it.\nThen the community would truly be providing\na lot of its own resources\nand managing them directly as well.

The Government's provisions on\nevery aspect of education, nursery\neducation, teacher supply, teacher\neducation, secondary education, further education, adult education, part\ntime education and higher education\nwere found to be totally inadequate.\nThe government proposes to cut back\nstudent places from 8 3 5 , 0 0 0 to\n7 5 0 , 0 0 0 in 1 9 8 1 . The introduction of\nthe Diploma in Higher Education\nwhich is a two year course is felt to\nbe a cheap form of education inferior\nin results to an equal time spent at a university degree course and unwanted by employers. The entrance requirement of two A Levels for entry\ninto B.Ed, degrees are felt unfair and\ndiscriminatory against working class\nchildren who have not had great\nemphasis placed on their academic achievements.\nAn amendment to blacklist all colleges offering the Dip. HE was de-feat ed, as the decision lies with sixth\nformer s and not students, and there\ndid not seem to be a satisfactory way of mobil ising the schools as well as colleges. A pupil desperate for a place in higher education might not\nbe very co-operative in refusing a chance to get a Dip. HE. The main decision taken was to\nrecognise that the White Paper campaign was just as important, if not\nmore so, than the Grants Campaign and that they should both be given\nequal priority.\nMiners and Phase III\nOur only speaker booed!\nConference condemned Phase III\nfor lowering the living standards of\nthe majority of the population and curtailing working class rights of free\ncollective bargaining, and for serving\nthe interests of the monopolies, and their allies, the tiny majority of the\npopulation who own and control the\ncountry's wealth. The only way of defeating Phase III was seen to be\nthrough united action of those whose interests it damages, the working class and its allies including the student movement.\nConference therefore decided to\npledge full support to the miners' strike and help it in any way possible.\nAn amendment proposed by Norw ood Tech. pointed out that the\nminers' struggle raised the question\nof power and was not merely a test\nof strength between the miners and the Government.\nSpeakers, on behalf of the amend ment, from the Workers Revolutionary Party warned continually of the\nfact that the Tories will not hesitate\nto bring in troops and tanks due to\nthe economic crisis.\nIC's only speaker Alas d hair Camp bell, supporting the amendment c lai med that the Littlejohn affair was only\nthe tip of the iceberg of the Government's undemocratic proceedings and\nwas booed for recommending a united campaign with the miners for\nthe removal of the Tory government.\nDelegates\nNorman Sayles, Trevor Phillips,\nDavid Sinclair, John Porter, John East, Alas d hair Campbell, Alf Perry,\nSonia Hochfelder.\nEditor's note: this is the personal\nviewpoint of the Felix reporter at the\nConference.\nIC SQUAT IN 28 JAY MEWS\nOn the afternoon of last Thursday a group of students from Imperial\nCoMege, in conjunction with Maida Hill Squatters, took over 28 Jay Mews \u2014 Which has been empty for6 months while students and families\nthroughout London suffer chronic homelessness and high rents.\n28 Jay Mews \u2014 like a number of\nother dwellings in the same block \u2014 is empty because, it is believed, the owner is speculating; hoping that by\ngetting vacant possession of the\nwhole block it could be profitably\nsold to Imperial College or used for\nother redevelopment.\nStudents today in London cannot\nafford to live. Typically, rents are \u00a39\np.w. \u2014 this is impossible on a grant\nof \u00a3520 p.a. Students cannot hope to reverse\nthe State's Tory educational policies\nunless we can prevent the implementation of these policies.\nA big factor in the chronic shortage\nof student accommodation in London\nis the cut-back in Higher Education\nexpenditure, which means accommodation is not built, subsidies are\ncut so college refectory prices go up,\nand the real value of grants is red u ced. In Essex University students are\ncontinuing their occupation of the\nUniversity administration block. To day there is a national demonstration\nthere in response to the call put out\nat Margate NUS Conference to defend\nthat occupation. The squat of 2 8 Jay Mews is part of that solidarity action.\nThe Essex occupation is directly\nagainst the cut-backs and their\neffects in Essex \u2014 for instance they\nare demanding firm guarantees that\ncatering and accommodation facilities\nare expanded.\nIn Westminster at the moment 1\nin 8 houses is empty. We believe that\nif the College Authorities are at all serious in their su port for the grants\ncampaign they should support this\nsquat and in conjunction with Westminster Council make use of some of\nthese empty buildings for the housing\nof students and families. There are more empty dwellings in Westminster\nthan homeless people.\nFrom this squat we ask the college\nauthorities to :\n1. Negotiate with the owners and Westminster Council to arrange permanent use of 2 8 Jay Mews and other\nempty dwellings in the block. This to\nbe done by a compulsory purchase\norder if necessary.\n2. Pay for repairs to and legal defence of the building.\nWe are approaching other squatting\ngroups, housing groups, tenants' or-gan is at ions, and Trade Unions to take\npart in the wider fight for decent\nhousing for all; and insist that the\nhomeless \u2014 students or families \u2014\nare not to blame for homelessness\ntherefore the authorities must be made to provide; and where they fail\nto do so we support its taking \u2014 its\nreal nationalisation\u2014as we are doing.

Golfing Society\nMatch Report for 28th November\nWith the wind how ling and the first snow flakes falling over South\nKensington the l.C. Golf\nTeam headed for the\ncountry hoping to gain\nsome respite. As we drove towards New Mai den we had hoped that\nthe Wind would slacken\nand the sun appear as\nTony Blackburn had indicated on the radio\nonly that morning. It did not; 'in fact it became\nworse. Rich, driving his\nLand-Rover as only he\ncan tried to check this\ndeterioration by cutting\ndown dead-end lanes\nand even heading back\nto London. Alas! it was ail in vain and by the\ntime the Kingston Poly\ncaptain greeted us at\nMaiden G.C. our appetite for competition had becomes owe what fro-zen.\nWhile the opposition\nstood shivering on the\n1st tee the l.C. team\nhelped themselves to\nsome excellent ham\nsandwiches( with and without mustard!) as\nwell as a few shots of\nwhisky. Give Pemberton\nwas upset to discover\n(hat the club possessed\nno raw onions, knowing full well that his golfing\nperformance without\nonions would be similar to Popeye's strength behaviour without spinach. However the thought of\nthe cold afternoon awaiting him soon cooled him\ndown. For tactical reasons\nthe captain insisted on\nthe team staying indoors\nfor at least half an hour\nreasoning that the opposition's feet would toy\nthen be part of the local\npack ice. He was not\nfar wrong. Walking out to the\nfirst tee the captain dec i ded he could not play\nmore than twelve holes\nin such conditions. He\nwould therefore have to\nslaughter his opponent\nquickly. This he duly\ndid, ably aided and abetted by his opponent\nwho, on finding himself\nfive down after seven\nholes, decided against a comeback and slid to an\neight and six defeat. This whole match took little\nover an hour and it was not until almost an hour\nlater, whilst the captain\nwas warming his socks by the open fire in the\nlounge, that the next of\nthe ' Nordic Braves' skated in. This warrior\nwas none other than\nnew cap Mike Strickland showing a broad four\nand three Victory smile,\na smile that he was un able to alter until he had poured a couple of\nsteaming hot cups of tea\ndown his glacier-ridden\nthroat.\nDarkness fell and the\nresting competitors grew\nanxious. Where was superstar Bill Calderw ood, Richdrover Brown, Clive Pe mb onion and Richard Wad di love? Could they be lost? Our\nfears faded as dinner\nwas served and soon we\ndid not care. It was whilst in this pleasant\nspirit that Bill (alias\nGod) came in, an obvious victor by three and two. ' Drover' Brown followed him, having\nhalved his match. Old 'Land Rich' had really\ncut things fine, being\nthree down with four to\nplay. Soon after this\nRichard Wad di love came in, an easy victor by three and two (repaying\nthe faith the committee\nhad had in selecting him. This lad shows great\npromise!)\nWhen dinner was over\nwe all sat back and relaxed by discussing the\n'Energy Crisis' in front\nof a large electric heat-er. Whilst in the process\nof totting up the score\nBill noticed we were one\npoint short. It was then\nthat we recalled that\nClive had not arrived in\nyet. Immediately the two sides decided to send\nout a search party. When all was organised Mike Strickland broke in\n(looking out the window at the time) saying,\n'Jeeze, it's still snowing and looks damned cold!' The search party sat\ndown again and waited. On the stroke of five\nClive staggered in a complete wreck. His golf\nbag was frozen to his back, his hair covered in\nsnow. Before he collapse d, knocking over my\nwhisky as he did so (a bad move) he muttered\nthrough his sleet-infest-ed jaw 'Lost!' Pouncing onto the frozen onion\neater we nursed him back to life with injections of brandy. When he came to we asked\nhim ' Why the hell did you stay out in the darkness and cold if you\nwere going to lose?' It\nwas then that he expounded on how he was\none down after seventeen holes and since his\nopponent was clearly\nlosing his way in the\ndarkness he felt he\ncould tie the match at\nthe last hole. Thus he\nw hopped his final drive\nstraight down the middle whilst his opponent putted his way up the fair-way, keeping the ball\nclearly in sight. Clive walked up to where his\nball should have been\nand did not see it.\nHence he had to o on cede the hole and match\nto his no-good-son-of-a poly gun opponent.\nThat Give's match\nwas an epic History will undoubtedly show. Indeed, although the season is yet young I have\nlittle doubt that when the historians come to\nreview the season,\nGive's match Will be regarded as his finest\nhour. Rich' s his nearest\nhour, and for the skipper\nhis coldest hour. The match as a Whole will stand as a tribute to the\nquality of guts mankind in all its forms can de-mon st rate; even as stu-dents.\nFinal Result: l.C. won Team: Nigel Foster\n( Capt), Bill Calderwood, Rich Brown, Mike Strickland, Give Pemberton,\nand Richard Wad di love( this is his real name. In\nprevious editions of\n' Felix' his various aliases\nhave been used for\nsecurity reasons \u2014 now\nhe is an established star\nthis is no longer necessary). Nigel Foster\nWHICH WAY NOW?\nCROSS COUNTRY CLUB REPORT\nLast Wednesday, a consortium of twelve\nintrepid cross-country\nrunners set off for the\npolar wastes of Potters\nBar in what can only be\ntermed 'a cong l omer ation of odds and ends' \u2014\notherwise known as a nR.C. C. minibus. With Steve Webb once again\nproving that this contraption could in fact move,\ndespite the fact that he\nwas flying around\nalarmingly on a sliding seat, we found ourselves\nat the Vets College at\nthe ridiculously early\nhour of 2 o 'clock.\nCross-country club\nefficiency was once again\ndisplayed when the Vets\ncaptain \u2014 and also aU.L. official, which explains everything \u2014 ask ed us When we had been\ninvited, as though we\nweren't supposed to be\nrunning. Despite the absence of G. Imp, the mis understanding was cleared up and along with L.S.E., Vets and\nBrunei, l.C. lined up to\nface battle with the near-Arctic conditions \u2014 Pad says he is working on a centrally heated jock\nstrap as certain extremities tend to freeze up\nwhen it gets so cold. The course was 5\nmiles of ploughed field,\nnumerous stiles and barbed wire fences,\nwoods and railway embankments, and anything\nelse you care to think\nof. Unfortunately, the\nsnow obliterated many\nof the flour markings,\nand any number of conferences were held to\ndecide which way to go,\nand matters were not\nhelped When workmen showed us the wrong\nway. Rob All in son, once\nagain, led l.C. home in\n6th place, and would have done even better\nin Pad'swell ies. Then\nfollowed Ian Ellis in\n12th place and Paul\nClarke in14 th. Rich 'Hair Artist' Harrington\ncame in with Keith ' my knickers are wet' Ahlers in joint 18th position\nand then came the famous packing at the back,\nfor which IC CCC has\nbecome renowned in\nathletic circles. Steve\nWebb, after turning an\nankle in one of the many\nploughed fields, ran in\nwith Rich' Alt' Garnett,\nwho seems to be suffering more than most of\nus, from a lack of train-ing. Ashley Cooper was\n2 3 rd, narrowly ahead of\nMike Welford in 25th, despite having numerous stops to decide\nwhether we were lost.\nThe match officials\nwere just about to give\nup hope of seeing the\nrest of IC, presuming\nthem lost without trace,\nwhen we saw the unmistakable sign of Pad's golden locks fluttering in\nthe wind. Along with\nhim were the Honorary\nFootball Officer, Rob\nM addison, and Andy Fairhead. Afterwards, as\nif it weren't already\ncold enough, we were given a drink of ice-cold\nshandy. Then back to\nthe changing rooms, and\na free five-minute demonstration by Rob Mad dison on how to dismantle a shower unit.\nAfter a good tea, we\nreturned to the Queen's in rapid fashion, and\nthen the Union, where\nRob All in son emptied\nhis pockets of our\nmoney, Keith Ahlers insisted on going to the\nBoltons, and is now a changed man. The meeting was adjourned at an\nunknown hour.\nInjuries include Pete\nJohnson( bruised foot),\nJ.S.( Jockstrap?) Kaliray (weak excuse), Geoff\nSpurr (bruised foot), G. Imp (irreparable brain\ndamage), Dave Howl brooke and Dave Jones with too much work.\nNeil Boag has been listed a missing person.\nDave Payne didn't ask\nfor a mention in Felix\nthis week, so he's not\ngetting one.\nMJW\nStratford Competition\n28th November\nThose members of the\nI.C. G.A. who didn't quite make the grade of\nthe first team also braved\nthe cold east wind and the howling blizzards of\nWednesday, November\n28th. The scene was suitably set, the course covered by ice-sheets, and greens lacking flag-sticks. Nine brave members turned out including such personalities as\nBev ( B.M.W.) Smith, Jules( the hustler) Dan, Adrian( the money)\nEvans, and Ron (can you\nlend me a golf ball?)\nWeatherall. Others included Tim Round, Mike( Mini) Marx and Howard Rosser.\nThe Winner by 6\npoints was, surprise, sur-p rise \u2014 Jules Dan, who returned an 8 8 \u2014 playing6 strokes below his 'official' handicap. Joint\nsecond were Tim Round\nand Adrian Evans, both\nwith 3 2 points \u2014 the\nlatter also scoring an 8 8 .\nAll available members\nof the golf club are encouraged to turn up at\nR.M.S. at about 13.00\nhrs. on Wednesdays for\nthese Stableford competitions. For a10p entrance 'stake' which goes into a 'pot' you\nhave the chance to return from the golf club\nactually having made a profit! (winner takes all). So far the record 'pot\"\nhas been 8 0 p! \u2014 surely\nworth turning up for.\nIf you golfers turn up\nat Civ. Eng. at 12.30 hrs.\non Wednesdays, there is\ngenerally a good chance of transport being available (though no guarantee of this can be given).\nAnd now that JULES has\nhad his handicap cut to\n18 by a majority decision\nof the Committee, everyone has a chance of\nwinning. Canoe Club\nSeveral days ago,\nmembers of l.C. Canoe\nClub took part in the\n'Descent of the River\nExe' from above Tiverton\nto Exeter, a gruelling 19\nmile race with fearsome\nrapids^ nd10 large weirs\nto be shot. The entry this\nyear was a record breaking 4 2 5 in all classes.\nThe 6 l.C. paddlers and\nsupport crew joined the\nUL U party.\nWe travelled to Exeter\non the Friday night in a transit and assorted cars\n(6 of them). Saturday\nwas spent looking over\nthe course (pubs) and The starts were Chaotic. Between 3 0 and89 boats lined up across the\nriver facing upstream,\nthe gun went and aH\nraced 2 0 0 yards up-stream, round a buoy\nand back down towards\nthe first weir. Then an other bunch started, also\ngoing upstream, to d \u00ab\nthe same manoeuvre.\nThis was repeated about\n8 times.\nDespite several swims and eskimo rolls all l.C. paddlers reached the\nfinish some with rather\nsmashed borrowed boats\n(one lost most of the\ninspecting the damage\ncause to 2 of the cars\nwhen they both argued\nwith the same tree.\nSaturday evening was\nspent drinking tactics\nand discussing beer in a superb little pub.\nSunday morning eventually came and everyone was suddenly struck\nby illness. The team\ndoctors, ph y sio and\nnurses (from various\nLondon Hospitals) c lai med it was nerves and so\ndespite some brilliant\ndetours we all reached\nthe start. The weather\nwas rather cold and the\nwater even colder.\ndeck). John Hubbard finished 1st in Senior K2 bringing back a big pot\nand a shield. Diana Dal g lies h came 3 rd, much to her surprise, in the\nLadies. Bob Jo ce,Ti m Perry and Bob Evans\ncame 9th,10 th and30 th respectively out of 1 3 0\nstarters in the Slalom Class. Dave Rosenthal\ndoesn't think he came\nlast. He did cross the\nfinish line with most of\nhis boat and several\npeople left way behind\nhim. Dave was paddling Senior K1. John H. and Tim P. \u00bb\n\n"
