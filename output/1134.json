    "content": "2 2\n\"\nT*\"*^ Games 1 February 1999\nPoohShark (PSX)\nGremlin\nIt's a Pool game. Yes I know that you probably thought that the pool game had been done to death a few years ago.\nThe last time the pool genre was seen it\nhad several knives in its back and was staggering down a back alleyway. Pres ume d dead, Gremlin have found it and, following drastic surgery, have brought\nit back to the streets with its new per-son a; Pool-Shark. So what makes PoolShark better than all those games that\nwere released previously? Is Pool-Shark a six-million dollar, fully bionic pool game or just a six dollar brush and shine job?\nPeople remembering those old Pool\ngames can conjure up the image of slightly squashed, squared off balls moving on a perfectly rectangular table.\nThings have improved since then. PoolShark offers the chance to play on not\none type of table but a whole shop worth\nof different tables. Play on accurate American sized tables, UK pub tables, and even full size\nsnooker tables. Also the\ntype of pool table affects\nthe background. Ahh yes\nthe background. Obviously the programming skills required to display\nthe table by itself were far beneath the prog ramming team, and so they have taken to placing the table in a virtual\nroom; so US tables play\nin either smokey pool clubs or airy American bar scenes. UK tables are placed in a pub-ish atmosphere, or a nice snooker club.\nThe programmers did toy with the Garage/Store virtual room for the 4 ft kids\npool table effect, but left it out because\nthe older programmers were complaining that that's really where their car\nT' T:,:r should be and if they did-n't pack it away there would be noX files.\nBut Gremlin have\nnot stopped there. In an attempt to make this the\ncomplete pools i mul ation they managed to sort out all of the different Rules sets. Unlike the\nreal world, you can find\nout the rules before playing a foul stroke and there is no opponent that suddenly admits that\nperhaps they really\nshould have mentioned that. Just to show off they even have managed to\nuse rules that allow different numbers of balls to be used.\nPool, though, is a two player game. What happens when flat mates and friends refuse to play after they get beaten for the tenth time\nin a row? Luckily the prog ram mers have decided to include some Al computer opponents, from the completely incompetent to the frighteningly good pool shark\ncrowd. So having captured\nthe width of pool, how I much depth and length\nI does PoohShark contain?\nI The graphics are crisp\n' and the balls move along\nthe table amazingly like proper pool balls\n- where players of my ability can snap the\ncue ball into the pockets and off the\ntable with an almost frighteningly regularity. PoohShark is a good game that has\nbeen spoilt by one thing. This one thing\nis the control mechanism. Instead of taking advantage of the analogue controller\nand providing a control mechanism like\nAct u a golf 3, (where the analogue controller controls the power of the shot), it\nis back to the old lining the cue and the\nball up and then pressing the button as\na power bar increases and decreases.\nWhile everything else in the game says\nplay me, this control mechanism says\nkeep your distance. Get used to it and the rest of the game is a delight. Definitely a try from your video shop before\nyou buy.\nGary 5.\nPreview Ville 3 - The Virgin Conception\nResident Evil 2 - The PC edition\nFinally Virgin Interactive is coming to the\naid of all those PC owners who don't have PlayStations or have playstation\nowning friends. All come and gather\nround for Resident Evil 2 is almost here.\nFor all those who have managed to avoid reading, listening or smelling the\npress coverage surrounding Resident Evil\nhere is a little bit of a hint of what you' ve missed. Back in 1996 Capcom released the original Resident Evil.\nA third person action adventure\ngame which featured tension in\nskip sized quantities. Playing\neither a male or female special\ncop, it involved exploring a deserted house where you uncovered clues behind the myst e riou s disappearances, found weapons, and defended yourself\nagainst\nmuch nastier and rather\nlarger place.\nHaving already consumed the residents of the\nsecluded house, the T Virus _\nhas now spread to the;\nnearest large population Jijj\ncentre; goodbye road rage, hello flesh eating zombies. Once again you can try\nto discover how the virus\ngot\nzombies and the various hell\nbound res i dents.\nThe sequel,\ntitled Resident\nEvil 2 so not to\nconfuse the American mar-ket, was set in a to\nthe\ncity, while avoiding\nzombies, and helping the few survivors of the disaster as c it her a rookie cop, or if\nyou like trouble, as\na spunky young heroine.\nSo what have they done to improve\nit on the PC? Well the graphics have\nbeen beefed up, and there is the choice\nof either the original English or the Japanese versions to play through. Above all,\nas long as they have not messed too much with the gameplay element( and\nthe 18 certificate seems to indicate not)\nthe game will be a certain five star.\n\n"

Email: stol c@lc a c.uk Tel:(017159)48104 Bust-A Gut\nFriday22 January saw in the first\nBust-A Gut comedy night of the new year. As usual dB's was filled\nto capacity, teeming with potentially\ndrunken students looking forward to\nanother series of acts from the Carlsb erg Ice Comedy Network. Ents manager Mark Home intro-duce d the night, accompanied by his\nusual bombardment of' original' heckles such as \" Nice nose!\" and\" Nice shirt!\"; he then went on to present Dan Evans as the com per e for the evening. As with any good com per e, he began with some audience participation. Although a standard tactic it\nwent down very well, aided by his\noriginal usage of the microphone stand as a'c lapo induce r'. When Dan An to polski mounted the stage, the audience was in a very\ngood, lighthearted frame of mind. He had the elements needed to make a very good comedian but unfortunately he had only just appeared on television two weeks before with the same routine. Not only had most of the audience heard his jokes prev i Oliver and Greg\nou sly, they even had the courtesy to\nfinish some of them for him. This cul-mina ted at the end of his act with a student heckle that left the comedian admitting defeat. After the interval, Dan Evans came back, larger than life, to introduce a very short set from an up and coming comedian Phil Nicol( not the Phil\nNic hol who headlined in November). Although he did have quite a few good jokes, he did not have the time to win over the audience completely one to lookout for in the future.\nNext up was the headline act of the night, Simon Evans. He certainly\ndid not disappoint anyone. We were treated to a superb display of intelligent and sarcastic deadpan humour that left the audience at his mercy. His\nact was excellently composed and unusually involved virtually no swear-ing. Observational comedy at its best!\nA truly enjoyable evening was had by all, and we look forward to Neil\nAnthony and Tony Burgess appearing at the next comedy night, on5 February.\nPresidential Talk-Back\nAfter all of my moan David Hellard, ICU President\ning over the last few m articles, it s time to\nreport back on move- | i|m ents in the College\nand the Union.|||| Ii rst of all, here's a list of discounts that\nwe can get in High\nStreet Kensington( note only HSK) with \u00bb \u2122\nan ICU card. There are still tens of companies I have to phone in order to get\nauthorisation from above, but here goes:\n1 0 % off at: HiTek, Top Gun, London:Dallas Pizza and Pasta (if over \u00a310 a head), Kensington Leather, Market\nLeather, Blazer, Jeans West, SONAKensington, Blacks, YHA Adventure Shop, 1 hr\nPhotos, Footlights (Food only).\nPlus: Tumblers (15% off food); The Studio ( 2 5 % off cuts) and Hair at Fairy (\u00a31 off\na cut and10% off anything else).\nSecondly, there's also good news on the library front, although not for a while. Next year the College is going to have an\nexperimental year of opening the library\non Sundays until 6 pm; let's hope that it\nproves to be the success we know it will\nbe. They are also looking into opening later than 9 pm on weekdays. The Health\nCentre is probably going to open later; as\nfor lunchtime openings, we're still push-ing.\nNext up, as the\nUnion has received so\nmany letters of com plaint about the Lond on Transport\nscheme( please keep\nthem coming), that if\nyou hand them into\nthe Union reception, we will check them\nand then send them by recorded delivery\nonce a week( thanks to Andrew Southern\nfor that idea). So now they'll reject you\nwithin days, not keep your pound and\nthere'll be no chance of your application\nbeing lost of stolen.\nThe College is introducing a formal\ncomplaints procedure for students. This\nwill allow you to monitor what is hap-pen ing to any complaints you may have\nabout the College and give different levels at which they can be settled, ranging\nfrom a College Tutor to possibly a Governor of the College Council.\nI hope that this gives you a bit more\nconfidence that the College and the Union\nare working to try and make your life at\nImperial that little bit easier.

Dress code none.333 is the name of the club and the night, well the night doesn't have a name( neither does their Friday night do as far as I can see). But does this matter\none little bit? Well, of course it doesn't. As long as everything is chilled and groovy in the club then who cares about\nbig name nights with wank y cult fol-lowing s? It's just as good to go to an unpretentious place like this with its\nown wank y cult following. There are\nplenty of regulars around on the Saturday night, but these are nice locals - no attitude or snobbery is shown to those clearly visible newcomers like myself. It\nwas as if I could have been going to the place for ages - and maybe I will in the future.\nI like most of the clubs that Igo to\non your behalf (tough life, I know!), but\nthis one was especially fluffy. From what I 've said above it is fairly clear that the club is just as important in this instance\nas the night. And if you went there you'd see why they mainly keep it to them selves. 333 is set on three different levels (of course!), the base is made of hard-edged D&B beats (with the crowd jumping about all over the shop), in the\nmiddle is your soft cheesy-house centre,\nwhilst the topping is an exquisite chill-out\nroom( one of the best I 've ever been to).\nIn this room where you can relax your\nbody after a hard bounce around the rest of the premises, but not to twiddle y, mind-aching ly boring nonsense by the Or band other assorted weirdos. No, this is chill-out music with a distinct edge to it. Soothing enough to be relaxing, but\nstill up-beat enough to keep that underlying feeling that you really want to go back and dance on the main dancefloor\nat some point soon. I know this is completely unprofessional of me, but I can't remember who any of the DJs were. No-one famous I don't think, but that was and is the whole point. It just didn't matter. The residents\nwere stunning (both their mixing and the\ntracks they played), the crowd was great,\nthe venue was funky, and you even had a choice of loos to go to (posh ones you had to pay for and ska nky fell as that\nwere obviously free).

    "content": "1 February 1999 Music 17\nAlbums Singles\nLTJ BUKEM\nProgression Sessions\nT he first two Logical progression\ntitles from the last couple of years have been heavy, fast,\nloud and sample laden drum and bass\naffairs ( who could forget that subliminal\nFerris Bueller sample?) and It was with\nsome optimism that I snaffled Mr B's latest studio offering.\nThe first impression is that of a more vocal style, keeping the trademark drum and bass drive but rounding off the edges of the sound, quieting down the big beats and generally calming the sound. He has added a very professional\nrefinement to the analogue treble lines;\nreminiscent of Orbital in their subtlety\nand lightness of touch. The sampling, too, has been tamed to an infrequent\ntreat instead of the staple (but wholly\nnourishing) diet of LTJ's previous works.\nSure enough, as the album continues,\nthe listener is drawn in, and the beats get\nprogressively harder and faster, moving into garage territory.\nThe vocals though, become a minor\nirritation with scant deviation from a very\nsmall repertoire of content and styles. For\nme,M C Conrad has an awful lot to say\nabout nothing. The quality of the music\nitself, gliding gently yet decisively from track to track, mood to mood, does more\nthan enough to satisfy, but after only ten minutes or so of listening you are begging for a change. A different vocalist or\npreferably an instrumental track? No, you get yet more of the unrelenting and almost grating onslaught of that same style, shamelessly and continuously extolling its own virtues. Even when a new rapper (DRSI believe) comes in, his\nstyle is largely un discern able from the resident. It seems a minor quibble, and admittedly I 've never been a fan of MCs banging on about how powerful the groove is and why we absolutely must listen to it -1 would prefer it vastly if they\nwould bloody well shut up and let me. And to be fair, the further the album goes, the more intensely the music comes at you, and bloody good it is too;\na rare instance in the creatively saturated field of drum and bass. Again, the\nanalogue effects have the potential to set it apart from the crowd, but that\ndamn MC just won't shut up. It's like\nbeing stuck in a cinema with someone telling you how good this bit is or to listen for this line because it is important\nlater: Just leave me to it, OK? Great beats,\ngreat bass, great atmosphere, great analogue work, but, well, you guessed it...\nTS Mr.Trout\nMidget are doomed to cult status.

When I received this CDI sat down on my funky inflatable chair and slipped the CD into my hi fi. All was well. But then my eyes glanced down at the sleeve notes\n- Smog's style Is described as \"Super\nSexy Space Cowboy\". Oh dear, I thought. This does not bode well. Luckily the music on the cd does rise\nabove the standard of the sleeve notes.\nBut not by much. I suppose if I had to pin some influences on this Chicago band, it would be Pink Floyd and REM. The lead singer has\na gravelly, gruff but tuneful voice and the rest of the band seem to be well skilled\nin their chosen instruments. But while\nsome tracks on the album worked in a simple and delicate way, I felt that some of the tunes sounded positively 'under\nproduced'. I appreciate that the band may be trying to move away from the highly techno log cal modern studio sound but at times the songs felt like\nthey needed a little fleshing out.\nProduction arguments aside the lyrics themselves involve a lot of thought\nabout how modern life is so anonymous,\nand routine. The songs detail fantasies\nabout chance eno unter s with strangers.\nOn the Road-esque travels through the country and beyond. The songwriter really seems to feel empowered by constant movement through his increasingly meaningless world. The lyrics really\nhelp prop up this album with the \" minimalist\" instrumentation forcing you to concentrate on the words being sung more than the rest of the bands contribution. This is an album of con traditions and half followed through ideas. After a couple of songs in this delicate style\nSmog have fashioned themselves along comes a Spiritualised Come Together\nstyle ro user, which shakes you up, with\nthe help of some tight harmonizing and the Chicago childrens choir.\nI think this album will probably grow on me with repeated listening s but I can't see it redeeming itself to suffice nt levels to merit a higher score. Summing up, this record has some really beautiful\nand delicate snatches of brilliance in it -but not enough to raise the standard\nabove average.\nOne to watch next album around. El Joel\nSIZZLA\nKalonji\nI wasn't expecting to be taken aback\nby this album when I picked it up,\nbut in confidence to my instincts, I was right. That's not to say that the material is totally crap. On the contrary,\nsome of it is very listenable and pleas-ant. I actually played this album twice\nwithin this week and it sounded different for the better on the second occ a sion.\nI wouldn't describe the sound as\npure, \"standard\" rag gae, if I may, it's more like a streetwise hip-hop beat riding on strong rag gae roots. Nothing stands out too much apart from break\nbeats on tracks such as Lovely Morning, which is a reviving track in its own right.\nAncient Memories is a perfect example of the hip-hop beats: mellow and fresh\nbut the origin is founded firm; strong\nvocals and a beautiful compliment of flute and string. That's as good as it gets\non this album. The album is only listenable up to\nabout half way. It just gets too boring after that. I hear a lot of the same back-beats on many of the tracks but that's just a probably arag gae thing. After a while, it just sounds like the same thing\nover and over - not good. You can probably guess which are\nthe only two good tracks on this album, but still not single material. It this album is meant to promote rag gae then I'm not impressed. If it's just something Sizzla felt like doing in his spare time then\nhe shouldn't have bothered. Don't expect to see this go platinum. El\nAsad\nOn first listen I really just did not get this.\nHowever next time round It made perfect sense. The song is all about the joys\nof travelling by bus and is done In an upbeat Sinatra-esque style. Alter at ew listens you really get Into this. How can\nyou fault a song with the lines 'Miniskirts\nwere in style when she danced down Ihe aisle in ' 63./But it's hard to get by\nwhen your arse Is the size of a small\ncountry.' The humour in i he song is\nspot on, nice bsl des as well.\nBabylon Zoo - All The Money's Gone\nI put this single on and as the song started, t thought that It had a worrying\nresemblance to a combination of Oasis\nand recent Smashing Pumpkins. As the\nsong progressed the resemblance was refined to an electronic Oasis The band\noven try a sort of strum my acoustic\nbreak, which Is screwed up royalty. This\nalso happens on the b side Chrome\nInvader and the remix of All the Moneys\nGone manages to improve i he song by\ndisposing of most of it. This single stinks\nof sell-out. the band seem to be telling\nus why they are making their come back. They can just go away now and never come back El Jamie\n\n"

I don't have a problem with\nsentimental movies. I don't have a problem with crying in the cinema( I frequently do) but what Ido have a problem with is any movie that tries at\nevery turn to make you ball your eyes\nout and call for more Kleene x. Stepmom is such a movie.\nProblem number one is definitely\nthe choice of director. Chris Columbus has come to fame via Home Alone, Mrs\nDoubtflre and Nine Months. This is not\nthe guy you want to put at the helm of a depressing wee pie with hardly a laugh\nin sight. Thus, we're left with an irritating\nmuddle of a movie, plus some really,\nreally annoying kids.\nOn the other hand, the biggest plus\ncomes in the form of the cast. Roberts\nand Sarandon are in typically good form( and are both hotly tipped for Oscar nomination), both producing their best\nwork for some time. Roberts does well to\nwin sympathy in the role of 'the other\nwoman' in Ed Harris' life, who struggles\nto look after his kids. Meanwhile Sarandon finds the entire audience rooting for\nher as she gives up her children, despite\nregarding Roberts' efforts as appal ingly15 Old bald blok e gets Julia Roberts. Clearly a believable plot there then...\ninsufficient.\nIt'san incredibly cheesy tale, as their\ncombined maternal instincts force the two women to get on, despite the fact\nthat they hate each other and have diametrically opposed outlooks on life. This\nconflict is deepened when Sarandon suddenly discovers that she has cancer,\nand( of course) has to give up the children so that they can get used to their\nnew mother....Somewhere in this pitiful\ntale is Harris, in unfamiliar territory and completely out of his depth.\nStepmom serves only one useful\npurpose - to showcase the talents of its\ntwo stars. Sadly, just because it contains\ntwo good performances, that doesn't mean it's worth seeing. It's not - so don't. Unless you're going to the cinema with\nyour mum in which case take five\nboxes of tissues.

Sadly, however, The Replacement Killers hasn't had the same kind of effect on the career of Chow Yun-Fat.\nThat's hardly an injustice, though, as\nthis movie isn't anywhere near the usually high standards of the diminutive\nstar. The gun play is good and there are\nsome brilliantly over-the-top action\nsequences, but the choreography isn't up to scratch, leaving the movie without\nthe crucial ' wow' factor.\nLost in Space\nLost in Space is worth renting for two reasons. Firstly, the fight with the space\nspiders on board the mystery space-sta-tion is breathtakingly good, splattering\nstate-of-the-art effects liberally across\nthe screen. Secondly, Matt Le Blanc's performance is hilarious - it's basically\nJoey in space. On the other hand, Lost\nin Space isn't worth renting twice for\none( simple) reason - the plot. It does-n't make any sense. At all. It only serves\nto link the effects shots (750 in all)\ntogether - and it even does that badly.\nBasically, it's a kiddies movie through\nand through.

But for once the game is not golf - shame as I had been re her sing all of my divot and ball puns all\nweek. No, it's Gremlin's Premier Manager'99, a football management game for the\nPlaystation owner with too much time on their hands. Those who have relationships with the opposite sex might just as\nwell get them to pack their bags and leave for Antarctica, for if you like football management games you might just\nbe paying them slightly less attention\nfor the next few months. Enough hype, what about the game. How does it compare against Championship Manager2, or even Championship Manager3( as if I 've been allowed to see that little beauty!). Well\nThe a. Sep .'98...\nbeing a Playstation game there is a certain emphasis on form, but fortunately\nnot at the cost of function. The graphics\nhave been heavily revamped since the last version, with a new front end, and several revamped tactical screens. The '99\nedition has also finally gone fully inter-national, with both Italian and English\nleagues running parallel (yeah I know that CM2 did that a while ago, but\nremember that's playing the 16 Mb game on a PC while here you are running it on something with slightly less grunt).\nAnother complexity is that training now occurs on a one-to-one basis. Working on Gascoigne' s fitness at the expense of his skills, rather than making the whole of the side neglect their skill training is\npossible (even poor old sick note Darren\nNEWCAS1 LE UNITED\nf crt g hsh Premier Dms iQ nl ue2 Jul '88 t CW CAST Lt UMTEB\nmight finally make it through ninety minutes before he loses another ligament).\nPicking the side a little too tedious for\nyour managerial post? I here is an option\nto allow the Al to select the best team for\nthe formation selected - though if you do select this option you arc not taking the game seriously (bit like those cheats who select automatic gears for the driving\ngames).\nOff the pitch and in the office, it's a case of balancing the books. The ability\nto improve the facilities and increase the\nstadium capacity arc two of the new ways to spend a fortune ( though no retractable pitch or roof options have\nbeen included so your stadium will\nnever be perfect). To balance these improvements money can be brought in\nfrom sponsors. Obviously starting from\nthe third division the sponsors you are\ngoing to get are not going to be s pen ding a lot of cash, but bring some success\nto the club and the money might start\nrolling in. Where there is pleasure there\nis also the flip side of pain. Bring the sort\nof success that Reading or Manchester C. were enjoying last season and there is a fair chance that the chairman might well\ngive a vote of confidence, just before\nopening the door to the virtual job c en tre.\nWorth the money? for all those statistic junkies, football management simulation addicts and unwashed with too much time it is more than a worthy successor to Premier Manager'98. Those\nwho have never played a football ma nager game, select the automatic team\npicking function and it might just lose\nyou a week or two( time travelling forwards rather than backwards). It is simply the best football management simulator on the Playstation.\nGary S.

    "content": "1 February 1999 9\nHere's the news: supermarkets are not cheap. When It comes to fresh produce, you can cut as much as two thirds off the bill by taking a trip to the local mar-ket. I'm lucky enough to live a stone's throw from North End Road market in Fulham, and my weekly visit rarely costs more than ate nner. Moreover, there is always loads there forme, and friends frequently pop by.\nShopping at a market is undoubtedly less convenient. Opening hours are restricted, and you will\nhave to queue at a number of places to get every-thing. The range is also worse than supermarkets. It\nis impossible to be sure that the more unusual ingredients will be available, and you do have to be on the lookout for the really low quality stuff that is\nsometimes about. Having said that, forme the advantages of market shopping far outweigh the disadvantages. These recipes can only be made for sensible money if you buy the ingredients at market prices. Both\ninvolve taking huge quantities of food, andre duc ing to portions which are absolutely brimming with flavour.\nRoasted tomato and red pepper soup\nServes six. This is a variation of the recipe featured in the New Covent Garden Soup Co. book. It feels like real cooking, because serious quantities of ingredients are used, and every last bit of flavour is\ncaptured. Don't be put off the the quantity of garlic used. It looses much of its intensity in roasting, gaining a really rounded flavour.\n3 large red peppers10 medium tomatoes1 head of garlic\n1 medium onion, chopped1.5 pints of vegetable stock1 tablespoon of flour\nolive oil\nsalt & pepper Pre-heat the oven to about190 C, gas markS. Wash the tomatoes and peppers. Halve and arrange in a large roasting tin, de see ding the red peppers. Break up the head of garlic, and scatter the cloves (skin intact) about the tin. tin all y,g lug as much olive oil as you dare (I'd go for at least\n3 tablespoons) over the top, then put the tin in the Cooks\nCorner\nm mm\u00a9\noven for an hour. Take the tin out of the oven, and rest it over the\nhobs. Remove the tomatoes, peppers and garlic to a plate. You are left with a wonderful flavoured oil. Turn on a hob under one corner of the tin, then gently s aute the onion in the oil. You should find that\nthe garlic has softened significantly. Squeeze the cloves out of their skins. In a cool corner or the tin, mash them with a little salt to make a smooth paste.\nWhen the onion is softened, mix with the garlic then\npush the mixture round the tin, scraping off any tomato or pepper that has stuck.\nTransfer the mixture to a clean pan, and heat.\nAdd the flour and cook for one minute, then carefully mix in the stock. Add the tomatoes and peppers to the pan, then bring to the boil. Simmer for about20 minutes, then blend until smooth. Season to taste and serve, preferably with loads\nof warm bread. Pork Braise\nServes one. This simple recipe is great when you' re cooking for loads of people, but still want to make something with plenty of flavour. I 've given the quantities per person, because this is eminently scalable. The only limit is the size of the pan!10oz pork chop half a red pepper, seeded and chopped a couple of mushrooms, chopped about50 g swede a quarter onion a quarter pint of meat stock\na teaspoon of cinnamon oil, preferably not olive\nsalt and pepper Cut the pork into cubes, discarding bone but retain-ing any rind. Heat the oil in your pan until it is really\nhot (but not smoking), then add the pork, and fry for\nabout a minute. The idea here is to brown the meat,\navoiding an anaemic look and sealing the flavour\ninside. This simply will not work if the pan is too full.\nIf there isn't enough room for all the meet to touch the bottom with space to turn, then fry in batches.\nWhen the pork is done, simply add all the other\ningredients and stir. Add any rind too this gives the braise added body. Simmer for an hour, then season and serve with\nrice or a baked potato. Next week: Death to diets, and perfect mushrooms.

    "content": "6 letters1 February 1999\nFootball Club Successes\nDear Felix,\nLast week's \"competitive\" match report\nentitled \" Sil wood Stomp on IC 6th s\" has prompted me to write this letter at\nlong last. As captain of the sixths it has become apparent tome that anyone following our progress in your pub li cation has so far read only about seven goal reversals to RS M II and Sil wood Park, and may infact think that our32 win at lowly Hey thro p College is our only positive result of the season! Let\nme enlighten you all, and hopefully show you that we are not a waste of space, as many of you must think.\nIt is true that we suffered an ignominious start to the season. A largely\ninexperienced side succumbed to two heavy defeats by the big boys of Division Six, RS Man dRAM. Since then our injured players have returned, some excellent new talent has been recruited, and we have grown as a team, in terms of both spirit and ability. A creditable 3-3 draw against the then league leaders ( un publicised for some reason) started our revival,since\nwhen we have won our last three league games scoring eleven goals in\nthe process. Our tremendous run of form culminated in a71 cup triumph away to higher division opposition last\nweekend[ for which a match report\nshall be/has been submitted], which sees us through to the quarter-finals.\nRegarding the Sil wood Park game, this was one of a number of friendlies used by myself to try out squad players,\nand the team that day included only three regular starters (i.e.a virtual seventh team). Lven so, Sil wood have some decent players and we too look forward to a possible rematch. This brings me back to where I started, and makes me question if the footballclub receives the credit it\ndeserves for its sporting achievements. I wonder how many people are aware that last season the1 st XI reached the Challenge Cup Final and the3 rd XI won their division, while the fourths reached the last eight in the national stages of BUSA, the5 th s reached a cup semi-final\nand the6 th s produced4 players who now play for higher teams. It is antic-ipa ted that similar success will be achieved this season, so if the union is\nto use successful sports clubs to attract\npotential students, I believe these clubs\nhave the right to expect what is due in\nreturn, namely more support, both financial and otherwise. Yours sincerely,\nRob Davenport,\nCaptain, ICUAFC 6th XI\n'Lay Off The Pills!' Reply\nDear Sir,\nI write in response to last week's anonymous letter, 'Lay Off the Pills!', regarding\nmy article ' Agony or Ecstasy?' which appeared in Felix the previous week.' Anonymous' has missed the point\nso dramatically that I wonder if s/ he actually read the article at all. Everyone else\nI 've had feedback from has got the point,\nbut for Anonymous' benefit, I 'll state it\nagain. Iam not saying 'never take ecstasy\nagain1; and nor amI saying 'ecstasy will\nkill you'. What Iam pointing out is that\nEs can, and do, cause long-term brain\ndamage. Fact. Adam who, incidentally,\nwas real (and I didn't exaggerate his condition either) - was a walking example of\nwhat pills can do. I personally believe that\na balance can be struck between enjoying yourself whilst reducing the risk; that,\nof course, is down to the individual.\nQuite where Anonymous got the idea that I 've never taken pills, or indeed that I 've had a bad experience, I really\ndon't know. If s/ he'd bothered to read\nthe first paragraph s/ he'd know, unequivocally, that I have - and loved it. Clearly,\nAnonymous simply can't handle the facts,\nand is lashing out at random; the reaction is fairly typical of those drug-obsessed paranoids who like to think\nthe whole world is out to stop them from having a good time. That Anonymous lacks the guts even to sign their\nname proves s/ he falls into this cate-gory. Let us just hope that s/ he, and those like him, grow up soon and learn\nto be sensible before too much brain\ndamage is done. Yours sincerely,\nSarah Rutt\nMascotry Revenge?\nDear Black Hole Squad,\nWe are very disturbed to learn that after\nthe theft of Sedrick Safe, \"the safe is no longer safe.\" However we have recently\nlearnt that Sedrick may still contain some valuable items. We would be very displeased if any harm were to come to\nthese.\nGood luck in finding Sedrick, I hope the rumour that the miners have him isn't true, they won't treat him properly and that would be just terrible. We will of course consider any ransom that is\ndemanded, only when you can prove\npossession of Sedrick.\nWe are all praying that Sedrick is\nsafe and well.\nHit Squad\nC& GU Wade In More...\nDear Felix,\nI write regarding the events on the Ml during the Medics' Rag Dash; or to be more precise, regarding the ICS MSU hierarchy's reaction to the m.I myself\nama first year medic and I find it worrying that the president of my union took it upon himself to admonish those of my friends who were unfortunate enough to be caught up in this matter.\nThat is not to say that I consider those students blameless; they were foolish, if\nnot downright stupid to walk along a busy motorway, but surely even stupid\nstudents should be able to rely on the support of their union?\nI should like to point out to Wade that the College docs not employ him and his officers. He is not answerable to\nthe Dean, but to us, the students, including those who he treated so appallingly,\nmidway through an already stressful\nordeal. I can see that as president, Wade couldn't goon TV and say that larking\nabout on the Ml was a great thing to do; my concern is that he couldn't bring\nhimself to express his support to those concerned in private. Or maybe Wade feels that as president, he has a responsibility to the 'wider community' and other sorts of crap like that which forces\nhim to override hid gut reaction, which( hopefully) would have been to reassure The Ml seven' that everything would be OK. Sorry, Wade; that won't wash; it's all or nothing: either you're a student and support the rest of us\nthrough whatever scrapes we get into,\nor you're not and you don't. If you consider yourself not to be a student, or not\nable to identify with - or at least offer\ncomfort to - those of our colleagues who got into this mess, then what the hell are you doing at the head of our stu-dents' union?\nYours sincerely\nUnsigned Good Show From The\nHockey Thirds\nDear Felix,\nIn response to the report (1133) on the\nmatch between the IC and ICSM men's III hockey clubs, I would like to say Iam glad to see that there is a strong sense\nof irony among a team that was well\nbeaten on the day. Such a show of sportsmanship is commendable in any team. Thanks for the game and I look for-ward to our next meeting, James Row c ICSM Ills\nWho's Afraid OfTheQT?\nDear Felix,\nYet again some members of the administration staff in Sherfield have proved\nhow high and mighty they are. When I contacted a certain member of the Estates Division about the possibility of\narranging a sponsored a bse il from the\nQueen's Tower for Rag, the response\nwas particularly minimalist ic. In fact,\nbetween all the staff in the aforementioned division, they apparently did not\nhave the time to reply by phone or e mail, never mind a letter. When I delivered the letter to the person in question,\nI discovered that their office had moved. When I eventually found the new office\nI inquired as to whether this was in fact\nthe Estates Division - one of the members\nof staff helpfully replied, 'It might be,\nwho' s asking?'. Is this the way we really\nwant members of staff of OUR college to\nbehave?\nAn on Deadline for letters Is\n12noon Wednesday.\nLetters maybe edited for length, but will not be altered in any other way. Letters need not be signed, but a swipe card must be shown when submitting anonymous letters.\nThe Week Ahead\nMonday\nGames Meeting 12.30pm Film Meeting 1pm News & Photography Meeting 1.30pm Tuesday\nNews Meeting 12pm Clubscene 12pm Thursday\nPhoenix Meeting 12pm Friday\nNews Meeting 1.20pm Music Meeting 1.30pm "

    "content": "26 Arts 1 February 1999\nMONET IN THE 20TH CENTURY\nRoyal Academy of Arts\nThe Water Lily Pond (Symphony In Rose), 1900 Yellow and Lilac Water Lilies, 1914-17\nT he heroine of the film Clueless incisively categorised girls as \" the cute\nones, the ugly ones and the Mo nets - the ones that look beautiful from a distance but when you get close they're a mess.\" Claude Monet(18401926) is the quintessential Impressionist,\nconsidered by many as the founder and leader of this revolutionary artistic move ment. His picture title An Impression,\nSunrise prompted a derisive journalist to\ncoin the term Impressionism in 1874.\nfascinated by light, his typical masterpieces are atmospheric blurs of pastel\nshades, ultimately capturing the spontaneity and vivacity of nature. In fact, he originally earned his reputation as a caricaturist and portraitist, before dedicating\nhimself in earnest to landscapes. Monet celebrated his 60th birthday at the turn\nof the century and this major retrospective traces the evolution of his work during the final period of his career, with the intention of disclosing the mature facet\nof this artist.\nHis illustrious water lilies dominate the 80 canvases on display. Monet pur-chased the Giverny estate in 1890 and expanded the garden to include a water\nfeature - without doubt the most famous\npond in the world - \"for the pleasure of the eyes and also as a source of motifs\nto paint.\" A phenomenal understate-ment, since the Nympheas series is his\ndefinitive trademark. A version of the Path was recently auctioned for a record\n19.8 million pounds. Monet, Monnaie, Money. Admittedly some pictures are visually stunning, however others are sickly sweet (better suited to a bordello,\nclaimed an astounded critic). Monet churned out variations on his water lily\ntheme with an almost obsessive pas-sion.\nShimmering water, blooming flowers\nand lush foliage aside, the exhibition\nalso offers a selection of images from\nMonet' s travels to London and Venice.\nHis multiple s cries, depicting identical\nsubjects at different hours of the day\nunder various weather conditions (misty,\ncloudy, rainy, sunny) are particularly cel-eb rated. \"It's the fog that gives London its marvellous breadth and beauty.\" I rom his balcony of the Savoy Hotel, he repeatedly painted the Houses of Parliament\nand numerous bridges over the River\nThames.\nControversy rages over the significance of Monet' s deteriorating eyesight\nin his dramatic shift of style towards the end of his life. Hindered by a cataract\noperation, his crude brushwork verges\non the boldly abstract with an unfinished, informal edge. He also appears to\nexperiment with colour, including an atypical russet palette. The result is\nunconventional and refreshingly\nun recognisable. The aesthetic climax of the exhibition\nis the last gallery which contains samples\nof his ambitious Grandes Decorations\nproject. This sequence of horizontal pan els is particularly impressive by its monumental scale, some spanning18 feet in\nwidth. Monet donated22 pictures to the\nIre nch nation in celebration of the Allied\nvictory during the first World War.\nMonet invariably appeals to the public because his work is decorative, undemanding, accessible and familiar. The\nsensational demand for tickets (over\n130,000 pre booked places) is proof enough of his astonishing popularity in\nBritain. Although rumours of24 hour\nopening abound, beware of gigantic\nqueues and crowds. Despite the inevitable topical repetitive ness, shame fully inflated prices and outrageous mer-chandi sing, this acclaimed event is the highlight of the annual arts calendar.\nHelena\nUntil 18th April\nNearest tube: Green Park/Piccadilly Circus\nOpening hours: daily 9 am6 pm( friday\nand Saturday, extended to 10pm) Admission: \u00a39, concessions \u00a36\nThe Grand Canal, 1908 Houses of Parliament, Sunset, 1904\n\n"

Before that day, I'd only heard about it via whispered conversations that I strained to hear, catching only a few disjointed words before being deafened by the explosive giggles that ensued. From what I had ga th ered, it was a phenomenon that went on behind closed doors, rooms' in the US, but it\nwas spreading fast...\nI was first corrupted by Rikki Lake. It was around the time of daywhen most students decide to sample the wide range of daytime talk shows available on television (strictly for educational purposes, obviously). As I flicked\nthrough the channels, I caught that\nfamiliar, comforting mantra\" Go Rikki!\nGo Rikki!\" and settled down with my cup pa for half an hour of dysfunctional family life. But today there were no alcoholic mothers, no teenage fathers\nand no girl gang members. Today, Rikki\nfinally exposed the secret that had captivated me for so long the world of cyber sex. My days of innocence were over.\nThe show featured guests who had scanned the internet looking for love,\nromance or just a quick thrill. Each one had found the cybermat e of their dreams and stolen away into a private\nroom in order to consummate their\nlink. This had led to steamy romances stolen moments in the office and sleepless nights filled with passion. Each partner had laid\nbare their most secret\nof fantasies, safe in\nthe knowledge that\nthere would be no chance of their partner nipping out to\nTescos . ~ a whilst\nthey\nIn 'private\nyou could even\nget plug-in\nattachments\"\nwere handcuffed to the bed. Gone were the days of eyeing up the talent\nin the local bar, only to be left with your\npick of the slobbering drunks still stand-ing at closing time. When you logged on you could be sure of a love match. My eyes were opened. I knew that it\nwould only be a matter of time before I succumbed to the joys of cyber sex. Although curious, I was also nervous. Would Ido it right? Would my in experience show? And what would my lover do afterwards? Would he steal my cyber cherry and then log off, leaving meal one and confused? First I asked my friends for\nadvice. Most of them were also\ncyber virgins, but some told me stories\ninvolving a 'friend of a friend' who had tried it. According to one of my more open minded friends, you could even get plug-in attachments that could be remotely activated via your partner's keyboard. I decided to give this a miss\nas it may cause an unnecessary disturb ance in the computer room. After\nweeks of deliberation, I was finally\nready to experience my First Time. What I hadn't realised was that, for\nthe first timer, cyber sex is surprisingly\ndifficult to find. According to Rikki\neveryone was at it, so where were they\nall hiding? After 2 hours of searching I felt about as sexy as a used toilet brush.\nAll I'd found was a rather un savoury site\nentitled .\"hardcore grannies\"( mine is\ncurrently turning in her grave) and an online dating service. The latter\nwouldn't have been so bad if the only mem ber in London had n't looked as if his\n:\nace had somehow coll i ded with a ff|gj|h. speeding Hb tube train.\n^ iv\\ as in soft\nfocus. I was jus! about to\ngive up. when Is tumbled on the Naked Truth chat room. Could this be it? Had I found a cyber sex play-ground? I entered my pseudonym Love bunny. Keen but not too sleazy,\nthat'd do. After exchanging small talk\nwith the group, I professed my innocence, and asked for some direction,\" How can I enter a private room?\" \"Click on the View Personal Messages icon at the top of the screen to\naccess the room. Then type their name, followed by a colon in\norder to send a private\nmessage,\" came a helpful\nreply.\nAs soon as my finger\ntouched the mouse a barrage of messages filled\nthe frame, some merely suggestive and some downright disgusting. Scrolling downwards, I considered them one by\none... Black Stud wanted my phone number for rather more than small talk\n- noway. Hot Rod4 u's spelling was appalling( as a friend using the computer next to mc commented\" he probably can't type very well using only his\nleft hand\"). I his distasteful image served to cross him off the list immediately. Along with him went anyone who mentioned their ' big stick' within the first couple of sentences. Only a spotty young teenager would exhibit\nsuch a lack of foreplay. Finally I was left\nwith Michael. Confessing to him that\nthis was my first time, he promised to\nbe gentle with mc. As for what fol-\"I was finally\nready to\nexperience my\nFirst Time.\"\nlowed.... well a lady has her secrets\nyou know. After it finished, he kindly offered me a cigarette. As we puffed away we chatted about our lives. Michael was a tall, dark-haired golf professional. And this was only the second time that he' d had cyber sex. Somehow I wasn't sure\nwhere reality began and fantasy ended. It was when he asked me if I ever visited the States that the term 'desperate\nsad social misfit' came to\nmind. Bidding him good bye, he replied that he\nhoped we would meet again and that next time I didn't have to have\ncyber sex with him if I did-n't feel like it, we could just talk. Somehow I got\nthe impression that if I did talk to him again then he may ask me to marry\nhim. After my new experience I felt a little disappointed. After all Rikki's promises I was left wondering what all\nthe fuss was about. When it comes to\nsex, in reality men may fumble with\nyour bra strap and fart in bed, but at\nleast you know one thing what you see is what you get. In the world of\ncyberspace fantasy, there may be no flaccid moments or all too brief\nencounters, but you may well be\nwrithing in ecstasy with an overweight bricklayer. So did this experience finally\nput an end to my obsession with cyber-sex? Virtually.\n\n"

You are on the floor of a stock exchange, hemmed in by a riot of people in garish\njackets. They are flashing secret hand signals and shouting about the price of 'October Arabica' and 'Brent Crude'. You\nare feeling confused and a little claus-tro phobic. Then you are in the high mountains, skiing across a glacier. The\nsky is blue, the air is cold and the scenery\nstunning.

Up close, it is out of focus yet suffused by digital clarity. You\nstep back and then the detail merges into blurred splurges; some kind of order\nemerges from the chaos.\nThe ideas of order and chaos are clearly ingrained in Gursky's soul and come out as unifying themes in his work.\nBorn in Leipzig in 1955, he grew up in\nEast Germany with experiences of political and artistic repression.

This means that the gallery has\na strong tradition in showing Futurist art.\nA few months ago, I wrote about a brilliant show of Balla's paintings. Zang\nTumb Tumb is the latest exhibition dealing with the Futurists' impact and influence on contemporary art. It focuses on the literary input of the movement. The first room is full of excerpts from books and illustrations. Most of the texts are in\nFrench or Italian with some English translations but it would be of great help to master at least one of these Latin lan-gu ages. The main book studied here is\nParole in Liberia (words in freedom) written by the leader of the Futurists,\nMarinetti. The manifesto includes claims\nthat drastic changes need to be made in\nthe way people write. It celebrates the destruction of syntax and affirms the complete disappearance of punctuation.\nThese texts are tremendously energetic\nand inspiring. The Italians also had the help and personal involvement of the most original and groundbreaking French poets of the time: C end rar s, Cocteau and Jacob.\n1\nIf\nThrough reading we get a better\nidea of what Futurism actually is.

    "content": "14 1 February 1999\nReviews\nHilary and Jackie * * * * *\nStarring : Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, James Frain, David Morrissey, Charles Dance, Celia Imrie\nDirector: Anand Tucker\nT here are certain genres for which British cinema is renowned: cost ume drama,- bittersweet comedy; hard-hit ing drama; even romantic comedy. Yet despite being acclaimed as one of the finest British movies of the decade, Hilary and Jackie contains none of these elements. Or all of them let\nme explain.\nIn its simplest sense, it's a biopic of legendary cellist Jacqueline Du Pre (Wat-son), who rose to fame in sixties London,\nbecoming the most famous classical\nmusician of her day. But far more importantly, it's the story of her relationship\nwith her sister Hilary (Griffiths), and how, despite almost identical childhoods, their\nlives take almost diametrically opposed courses. Both are musically gifted, but it\nis the highly competitive nature of their\nrelationship which spurs Jackie on to greatness whilst Hilary leads a' normal' life.\nAt the sametime, however, it's funny - as both Hilary and Jackie battle\nwith their parents to explore sixties liberation - and heart wrenching as Jackie\nbegins to slide towards her tragic end. And there are romantic subplots too, Iff11 \u2022\nwm:\nJacqueline Du Pr&. Have cello, will travel..\nrevolving around the sisters marriage\nand Jackie's obsession with sex.\nDespite the quality of the story, how-ever, it's the construction of the movie that really deserves the highest praise.\nDirector Tucker's only previous directing\ncredit came with Saint-Ex, an arthouse\nbiopic hardly ever seen in this country.\nThis time around, he has ditched the strange camera effects, documentary feel and surreal style, instead favouring\na more audience friendly (although still\nnon-linear) approach. Having followed the sisters through their communal child-hood, the story then splits in two, first fol-lowing Hilary's life, and then Jackie's, fair enough, it's hardly an original idea,\nbut here it's bri lian t ly played out, as the two sisters lives drift apart and then suddenly become one once again, with their\nrelationship ebbing and flowing like the\nsea. It has to be a sign of quality when you see a scene repeated within twenty\nminutes, yet arc happy for that rep it it ion. Put together with some terrific acting from the cast of unknowns( plus a surprisingly up-beat performance from\nCharles Dance), this makes for a brilliant\nmovie. And then the music begins. Jacqueline Du Pre's trademark piece,\nElgar's Piano Concerto, is used to per-fec tion, sparingly reserved for two or\nthree key moments when its swelling roll\nwill send a chill down your spine. Powerful, emotional and heartfelt, Hilary and\nJackie is without a doubt the best British\nmovie of at least the last twelve months give praise once more to those wonderful people at Channel Four films -and deserves every ounce of praise that\nit receives. The Oscars are there for the\nwinning.... fl\nDave\nBulworth\nStarring : Sean Astin, Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Piatt, Don Cheadle, Graham Beckel, Paul Sorvino\nDirector: Warren Beatty\nT hanks to the American political\nrollercoaster that is the Clinton\nadministration, we seem to be inundated with 'clever' political thrillers\nat the moment. Primary Colours was a thinly veiled commentary on America's growing distrust of its politicians, whilst\nWag The Dog opted to reality in favour\nof satire. So, is Bulworth from the same stable?\nThe simple answer is no. The pitch\nbehind the movie rests almost entirely on that terrifying phrase 'Warren Beatty rap-ping'. It's a truly terrifying concept that he\nbarely manages to pull off - but not without some worrying suggestions that a large part of the American electorate\ncan only understand him if he raps his\ncampaign. Considering Beatty is a pillar\nof the US liberal movement, it's a very\nworrying attitude. Moreover, Bulworth\nisn't rooted in fascination with Clintons.\nIt's a satire about the ethos of US politics;\nthe overriding them-and-us dynamic which separates the politicians from the poorer half of their electorate. Beatty\nWarren Beatty and Halle Berry. Surely there's something wrong there?\nseems to honestly believe that if one middle-class politico actually experienced\nreal life in the slums then all America's problems would be solved. How sweet.\nSenator Bulworth (Beatty) is running\nfor re-election and facing a nervous breakdown. He suddenly decides that his\nlife is worthless, and puts a contract out\non his own life. With nothing left to live\nfor, he finally decides to start telling the truth. He tells a black audience that noo ne will ever make their lives better\nbecause they don't give money to campaign funds; he goes to all night parties\nand openly takes drugs; and, above all,\nhe raps.\nThanks to some good support from\nthe likes of Halle Berry, as the inquisitive\nlove-interest, and Oliver Piatt, as Beatty's long-suffering aide, it almost works. But\nonly almost. Ultimately, Bulworth can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be\n- Beatty clearly wants to make a point, yet\nthe inclusion of comedy hit-men only\nserve to weaken the message. More over, it's a message that applies to a fantasy world where South Central LA\nwould be prepared to accept a US Senator in their midst. If nothing else, it's impossible to take any image or message\naway from the film apart from the enduring picture of Warren Beatty wearing baggy trousers and a beanie hat and rapping a political address. A surreal\nexperience. 1 3\nJames\n\n"

This involves a group of enterprising students jumping out of a van next to Harrods at opening time, wearing only an invisible parachute, and then pegging it to the Union Building.\nIn recent years the event has been somewhat under subscribed, but this\nyear's SNKPJ was a huge success, raising an estimated \u00a31,000.

The sabbatical status was secured until the end of the next academic year\nby last year's President, Andy Heeps, but\nthis was conditional on a review taking\nplace before elections this year. Mr Hellard argued that the continuation of the\nsabbatical role would harm theMed School Union, as many good candidates\nwould not run if they were forced to\ntake a year away from their studies - and thus add an extra year on to an already\nlengthy course. Additionally, he suggested that the sabbatical president hindered the proper delegation of power throughout the Medical Union. The current ICS MSU President, Wade Gayed, countered that it is vital for\nthe Med School to keep the sabbatical\nposition for one more year. Until all the\nBy David Roberts\nproblems with the new course and the\nnew campus come to light, it is crucial\nthat there should be a full-time representative for all medical students. Form erIC S MSU Vice-President Seif Ahmad reinforced this stance, suggesting that\nthe coming year should see the new course settle down, and the Med School\nclubs will have had sufficient time to\nreorganise. Moreover, as Mr Gaye d noted, ICSM itself does not believe it will\nfully merge until 2003.\nAfter next year, all three BS years will\nbe based at South Ken, but until then it\nis widely believed that there is simply\ntoo much work for a non-sabbatical\npresident to cope with - as Katie Sheeh an( the ICSMSU VP at St Mary's) noted,\nwhilst there are still so many students\nwho have never been based at South\nKen, it is unfair to ask the site VP's to\ncover the gaps that the loss of the sabbatical would inevitably generate. The\nrole of the new sabbatical position. Deputy President (Education & Welfare)\n- which will come into existence next\nyear - was also raised, with many of\nthose present fearing that the loss of a sabbatical Medical President would see the new DP forced to concentrate almost solely on issues surrounding the\nnew medical degree course.\nTaken to the vote (after attempts to\npostpone a decision until next month were overturned). Council registered a massive majority in favour of keeping the sabbatical role, allowing Mr Gayed's successor to be elected as planned. The sabbatical role will thus last until July\n2000 (in accordance with an agreement made last year), at which point the role\nwill become non-sabbatical, on a par\nwith the presidents of the other three\nConstituent College Unions.

    "content": "16 Music 1 February 1999\nAlbums\nSNOWPONY\nThe Slow Motion World of SnowponyP\nPet Shop Boy and Girls\nOn first listen, I thoughtS now pony were just another\ngeneric indie band, with their\nsprite ly guitars and melancholic female\nvocals. But after a few late nights listening to the album, sitting in semi-dark-ness and feeling in a pensive mood, they started to grow on me. They use a subtle blend of harmonies that caress\nyour musical g spot with a gently probing finger, arousing melodic nuances\nand absorbing rhythms in your temporal s. Two years in the making. The Slow\nMotion World... shows quite a resemblance to The Breeders and My Bloody\nValentine, with whom bassist Debbie Goo ge once played. The songs still\nsound fresh though, mainly thanks to\ntheir use of aptly placed samples which lend a larger perspective to the tunes.\nThis is due to the influence of ex-Stere-o lab keyboardist, Katharine Gifford, who has certainly had a lot of experience in\nthe old sampling game. The album as a whole has a good range of styles - no two songs sound sim-i lar with a great mix of different guitar\ntextures, from the raw stutter of the opening track Easy Way Down to the\nfunky Rolling Stones-esque riff on John\nBrown, their most recent single. The\ngeneral tone of the album is reflective\nwith tinges of jealousy, neurotic is m and insecurity. This can make the lyrics very\nendearing and often makes a fairly dull\nsong into an interesting one such as\nthe track Love Letters which focuses on a broken relationship.\nDon't think that it's all doom and gloom, though. The shuffling groove of the percussion stops it all getting too downbeat, and there's always a big, deep bass-line round the corner to keep\nyou interested.\nI don't think there's enough here to\nput The Slow-Motion World... into the\n' outstanding' category but Snow pony have style and elegance, as well as elo-que n ce. It's definitely worth making an effort to have a listen and I know I won't get bored of this album for along time.\nB Tom\ntio ned already; it's the L mmerda le of music; it's akin to an afternoon spent in\nthe company of William Hague. One song, The Falls, manages to escape the\nmire, being almost sentient. The others\ncome and go like Italian Governments. Keeping a track of which song is playing\nis nigh on impossible - the only reminder\nof their presence is the constant tedium.\nIf your goals are average and your\nyearnings swathed in the ordinary then\nthis is the album for you.

There are nine\ntracks on the hour-long CD, which also\nIncludes a bonus track. All the tracks are\nhard house/ techno with heavy bass\nlines and Josh Wink type tweaking, perfectly complementing the more subtle\nbackground noises. It's a no-nonsense\nalbum, demonstrating that Hard floor cannot just remix, but can produce quality tracks of their own. As the advert\nreads, it's a collection of devastating\ntech-infected tracks - I 'll go along with\nthat!\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMinistry of Sound\n\u2022Clubbers Guide to '99\"\nFor many people these mix compilations are only as good as the singles\nthe DJ has used. Now quite a lot of pe ople have heard this album friends/flat\nmates/the guys in the lads, and they've\nall said the same thing.... \"The Albums got nice packaging, shame about the\ntracks\". A view I agree with. There may be two CDs with a total of 37 tracks but\nI'm very surprised at Judge Jules' se lec tion. Fair enough, as individual tracks\nthey're not bad, but when they're mixed together it's a bit of a mess. It is also a bit disappointing to see that Jules is the\nonly featured DJ \"mixing\" on the album makes the variety a bit thin. If you're\nplanning to spend the \u00a316 or so on the\nalbum, at least try and listen to it first.\nWith some pretty unimpressive tracks it\nwould be wise to do so! Not bad, but not\nthe quality we expect from MOS. John \"00\" Fleming\n\"Licensed to Thrill\"\nThis is an excellent mix compilation featuring John\"00\" Fleming. It's not digitally mixed, but recorded live and demonstrates Fleming's superb DJ qualities at their very best. The tracks will send\nuplifting trance and progressive house fans wild with delight - there's a mixture\nof anthems and some not so famous tunes. Each track is great and mixes well\nwith the tracks either side of it - as\nopposed to the \"just checked together\nto form an album\" syndrome. The mix\nfeatures tracks by Paul van Dyk and Jon\nthe Dentist - comes highly recommended.

The\nalbum( as you can tell from the title) is\na compilation of all the very best ff rr tunes to have been produced naturally\nthey're not all there but most of them are. There are three CDs and with about\n17 tracks on each one you are getting\nquality as well as quantity.

There's an enormous amount of\nvariety on the album, with tracks by CJ\nBolland, Salt n' Pepa, Orbital and Goldie,\nto name but a few.

Some of the\nsounds are fantastic and there is plenty\nof variety.

Next Generation\n\"Forever\"\nA very unusual tune with plenty of\nvocals (especially on the vocal mix!).\nAgain, lots of synthesisers used, though the track is a mixture of D&B, euro-house and normal bog-standard house\nall rolled into one.

    "content": "18\nAlbum\nMusic 1 February 1999\nPRINCE PAUL\nA Prince Among Thieves\n'Straight to video' film to follow shortly.\nW ith more tracks, guest artists and random animal noises than your regular hip-hop\nalbum, A Prince Among Thieves is much more than your average offering, tor a start it's been in the production pipeline for what seems an eternity,\nas release promises have been continually broken.\nHowever, now it's here and we forgive you Prince Paul\nfor without a doubt you have produced one of the hip-hop albums of the year.\nAfter time with De la Soul, Stetsasonic and a part-time job with the Gravediggaz, Prince Paul has all the\ncredentials to produce the great hip-hop album that this\nis. Moreover, after further listening there proves to be much more to A Prince Among Tfw'eves than what first\nmeets the ear. Like the Goats' classic Tricks of the Shade\nand the Gravediggaz' superb Niggamortiz, A Prince\nAmong Thieves tells a story. What's more is that following this music release we will later be treated with\na big screen cinematic version of the story - straight to video, I'm sure.\nSo, what's in the story? Unsurprisingly, it's about\nthe rise and fall of some thugs in the gangsta world of drugs, guns and music in downtown New York. The hero of the story is Tariq played by Breeze of local under-ground crew the Juggaknots and indie rap supergroup the Indelible MCs. The key to it all is raising the money to finish a demo tape for Wu-Tang overlord the Rza. Of course, to raise the cash our young hustler becomes a drug dealer and equips himself with a powerful firearm\nalong the way. Another non-surprise is that Tariq - the\nalleged good guy - ends up being shot dead by one time friend the evil True - played by newcomer Shaproving that evil always conquers good in these stories.\nBut what about the music? The beat flavours are\nclassic Prince Paul with Wu-Tang influences plus a little\nspraying of well-chosen beats for particular atmospheric scenes. Of the thirty-five tracks on the album the\nhigh points come with the disco spiced More Than You\nKnow where Prince Paul's old collaborators De La Soul\nare in charge of the rhymes and Crazy Lou's Hideout\nwhere long time hip-hop head case Kool Keith rants and raves as gun dealer Crazy Lou. There's further guest\nappearances from such stars as House of Pain'sL ver last( as a policeman, appropriately enough) and hip-hop old boys Big Daddy Kane and Biz Markie. However,\nit's the random animals that seem to have been randomly scattered across the album who are the most welcome guests, especially the elephant and the sheep who both interrupt the flow from time to time. Who knows what the relevance of these beasts is though. So after twelve years in the business. Prince Paul\nhas landed his first solo album, and this time the magic number is five. El James\nTha Bomb!\n/ This week has been rush, rush, rush. The\njj jk problem stems from too much to do and^ \u2022 B not enough time to do it in and that's why this week all you get is a quick look at the singles out and due for release in Britain. Next week should be better ...but with the way I write there is some doubt.\nWestslde-TQ\nthis has been getting nuff airplay and looks all set to do some serious damage on the charts. It's the first single off his They Never Saw Me Coming Set long player\nand it's right on point. Listening to it makes mew o nder whether it's rap or soul, T Q( real name Terrance\nQuaities) has moved the goal posts creating a single\nthat harks back to the smooth west coast sound but\nadds a little bit more. Westside is a homage to the man's homeland with the shout outs to fallen comrades( Tupac, Eazy) and props for the people he was down with back in the day. His vocals are excellent and the mid tempo beat is killer all addingto a standout single\nfor the start of'99. Gimme Some More by Busta Rhymes\nGimme some more, more, more of this. Monster tune that's just there! It's Busta time! This boy just don't stop,\nafter Woo Haa I thought there's no beating this, but\nfor the second set he comes with Put Your Hands....'\nand now for the new set he drops this. The boy is mad and this is out of this world....buy it!\n/ Want You for Myself by Another Level\nSo many people have cussed me for giving props to\nthese boys, why? (I wonder....music ed). People look at\ntheir image of an all boy band geared for girls and cuss\nthem, but you gotta check their tunes. This is a tight single that works on the vocals and these boys have got\nvoices, it brings back the old days of real soul.\nDestiny's Child - I 'll get on\nyour bus any day! Get On The Bus by Destlnys Child feat. Timbaland\nFirst taste came last year on promotional copy and had us all licking our lips, waiting for the release, and now it's here. Timbaland blows everyone away with his fantastic production and the four girls sing\ntheir hearts out. This is already massive\nand the British release should, if there's any justice, send it through the roof.\nWhen You Believe by Marlah & Whitney\nThe dream team? When news first broke, that they were\ngoing to do a track together, back in the summer I was hyping it to the max. Now it's out and to tell the truth\nit's a bit of a disappointment, at least I think so. The\nvocals are solid, I mean these are two of the best\nvoices in the business so you wouldn't expect them to\nI be shit. The rest of the record is not really worth the I effort, it just doesn't do it. Maybe it's because it's these\n\u2022 two that I expect so much more, try again girls!\nI Touch It by Monifah\nUp-tempo little number that has Moni fah trying to\ncome out like the original freak A dina Howard and miss- -ing. Some solid, if dod gy, production and the vocals are\ngood but the record hasn't quite got the finishing\ntouch. It's the opening single from her new album to .\nfollow and I'm hoping there's something better on the\nalbum or else it ain't gonna sell.\nMore Than You Know by Prince Paul feat. De La Soul\nThe first single release from Prince Paul's phat new album A Prince Among Thieves is his collaboration\nwith old pals De La Soul. It's a real change from the hard\nflavour that hip-hop is experiencing, and the disco\nbeat that the tune rolls along to is outstanding. Check\nit.\nMi ten\n\n"

Democrats Prosper in\nNUS\nThis year's National Union of Students Conference, which takes place in March, seems likely to see an increase\nin Liberal Democrat representation, with more candidates than usual standing for theN US National Executive. Labour students are fielding fewer candidates than ever, possibly due to the apparent failure by theN US to defeat the Labour government on issues such as student hard ship and tuition fees. The Liberal Democrat Youth and Students campaign manager, Geoff Payne, commented that \"this year the Liberal Democrats will have the energy and resources to mount a serious challenge to Labour in NUS.\" The effect of Liberal Democrat leader\nPaddy Ashdown' s resignation, after\nthis Spring's local and Euro elections, remains to be seen. Charities Converge\nFive AIDS organisations plan to amalgamate on1 April this year in the most complex merger ever negotiated in the voluntary sector. The five\norganisations involved are the Terr en ce Higgins Trust, Bridge side in\nLeeds, The HIV Network in Coventry, In brief...\nSussex AIDS Centre in Brighton and OX AIDS in Oxford. The new organisation will gounder the name of the Terrence Hig gins Trust and will be able to provide services to over 7 0 % of those living\nwith HIV in England an estimated19,000 people. About60% of all these people live in London. Nick Partridge,\nchief executive officer of the Terrence\nHiggins Trust, stated that \"this dec i sion...is a brave and mature response to the changing HIV and AIDS epidemic... The people who will benefit are those living with or directly affected by HIV.\"\nMole Found\nImperial College is not the place to be, according to University ratings com piled by Red Mole, an undergraduate web site. Votes from the first term of this academic year have now been processed, and reveal some interest-ing trends. When asked\" knowing what you know now, would you have chosen to\ncome to this university?\", 3 0 % of IC stud ents replied' no'. The survey then asked students to rate their university\non various categories, including' attractiveness of the opposite sex', 'nightlife', 'sporting facilities' and' quality of student newspaper'. Imperial's worst categories were Ac com mod ation and Attractiveness of the Opposite Sex, with Quality of Teaching, Computing Facilities and Nightlife being its strong points. Overall Imperial is\ncurrently23 rd in the country, just\nbehind Dundee and ahead of Oxford Brookes. Traditional Imperial rivals\nOxford and Cambridge came19 than d31st respectively. Leicester, Lancaster\nand Edinburgh are rated the best universities, with only around5% of stud ents regretting their decision to join them. There is still some hope for Imperial, however it is the highest rated\nuniversity out of all the London colleges. The ratings will continue to be updated on the Red Mole site through out the year - anyone wishing to register their vote can do so at\nwww.red mole. co.uk/student_ mole/ rat-Ings.\nGrandmaster Triumphs\nOn Monday25 th January the Chess Club held it's annual Challenge Match against Grandmaster Jonathan Mcs tel( who lectures in IC's Maths Departm ent).

    "content": "8\n1 February 1999\nRight Angles To Reality\nIn the days of my youth I was told what\nI it means to be a man. Now I 've reached\nI that age I 've tried to do all those things\nthe best I can. But it's not all been plain sailing - ohno. Good times, bad times, you know, I 've had my share. Just recently my girlfriend (and it may surprise some of you\nto know that I have, or rather had, one), my woman left home for another man whose only outstanding feature, to my mind, was his striking brown eyes. I would have\nthought that being trampled underfoot\nwould have shook me, but well I still don't seem to care. All I know is that I fell in love\nwith a girl as sweet as could be, but that it\nonly took a couple of days 'til she was rid\nof me. We seemed so right for each other\n- she swore that she would be all mine and love me to the end and I really believed\nthat she was the one but sometimes all\nof our thoughts are mis given. Ooh it makes\nme wonder. It really makes me wonder.\nWe used to have a whole lotta love but\nafter a while I couldn't get through to her.\nWe suffered a communication breakdown\nand it was terrible - she turned out to be a real heart breaker. She was unfaithful to me on a regular basis, even in my own flat - she\nwas messing around with every guy in\ntown, dragging me down by bringing them\non home, just when I had begun to wo nder \"how many more times?\" she dropped\nthe bombshell: \"Babe, I'm gonna leave\nyou,\" but apparently only when \"the su mmer comes a rolling\" - it was March at the time. In reality however, I knew that one of those days, and it wouldn't be long, I'd look for her and baby she'dbe gone. I was right. She didn't even have the courtesy to\ntell me to my face - she just left me a brief\nnote. Apparently she'ds hacked up with an\nAmerican. Last thing I heard they were\ngoing to California.\nWell it didn't take too long before I found out what people mean by down and\nout. I began going out on the tiles in the\nevening, drinking heavily. More than once\nI woke up in a strange place, dazed and confused. But I can't really complain - it's nobody's fault but mine. I might have\ngone on like this indefinitely, but for a chance meeting that would turn my world\nupside down. Walking in the park just the\nother day, what do you think I saw? Is aw people sitting on the ground with flowers\nin their hair and they asked me to stay for\ntea and have some fun. Time passed and I didn't notice, but it had got very dark and\nI was really out of my mind. I must have\nbeen, because otherwise I would never\nhave had the courage to speak to this gorgeous blonde who was one of the group.\nHer name was Truda Mountain and she said she was from Norway: \"From the land\nof the ice and snow, from the midnight sun\nwhere the hot springs blow,\" to use her\nown words. Straight off the bat she told me that she was unmarried but that she was open to offers. For my part\nI was besotted, although I think some of what I was saying was lost\non her -1 was excited and nervous, and in\nsuch circumstances I have a tendency to\nramble on. It got later and later, and eventually with the leaves falling all around it\nwas time I was on my way. I thanked them\nand told them that I was much obliged for\nsuch a pleasant stay, but that now it was time for me to go.I took my leave of\nTruda with regret, but not before we had\narranged a date. I suggested going to the\ncinema or the theatre: \"Let me take you to\nthe movies,- can I take you to a show?\" I said. But she smiled and said that a quiet\ndrink would be better. I got the tube back\nto my place still walking on air - clearly this\nwas a time for rejoicing, a celebration day\nin fact. Unfortunately the mood was somewhat spoiled by my being stopped by a plain-clothes ticket inspector who fined\nme \u00a310 for having a Travelcard for only\nZones 2-6 excluding Zone 1. I protested,\nsaying that I didn't realise that it was quite\nso vital to have a Zone 1 ticket when travelling to Putney, but the he fined me any-way, saying that it would teach me a lesson\nand that \"the time will come when you will\nlearn that One is all, and all is One.\" Nasty\nman.\nI had agreed to meet Truda the very\nnext day in a bar near to her flat. It turned\nout that she lived a small apartment at the\nend of the southbound Northern Line with\nonly a black dog for company. Thus, it was\nin the darkest depths of Morden that I met a girl so fair. I reached the appointed\nspot - a sorry-looking bar-cum-hotel called\nThe Royal Orleans - with time to spare.\nStrangely, the entrance was locked and the\nonly possible point of entry was a fire exit\nmarked \"Egress Only\". But with little choice\nin the matter I threw caution to\nthe wind and went in through\nthe out door to find myself in\na tatty but ornate entrance hall,\ndecorated in the Indian f ash ion. It looked like a run-down\nversion of one of those houses\nof the holy men that you occasionally see in travel documentaries a place that had\nseen a good deal of wearing\nand tearing but that still had a certain presence. Eschewing\nthe delights of the lobby I went\nin to the bar which was brighter\nand cleaner. On one wall\nsomeone had painted a scene\nof the ocean. Truda had not yet\narrived and so I took my place\nat a corner table and asked to\nsee the menu. I ordered tea for\none and a custard pie, all the\ntime looking around me and,\non account of the giant mural,\nfeeling strangely like I was Matt Salter c'ow n^y^ es e as ic'e' W ni'e I waited I decided to try the\n1950s style juke box that stood in another\ncorner of the room. Unfortunately, it was broken and only played one record so that\nno matter how many buttons you pressed,\nthe song remains the same. Still, the one functioning track was an Elvis number and as it'd been a long time since I'd rock and rolled I sat back to enjoy what the King had\nto offer.\nEventually Truda arrived, looking lovelier than ever, but walking, I noticed for the\nfirst time, with a pronounced limp. It was clear that she had difficulty supporting any\nweight on her left leg. When she had sat\ndown, I asked about her ailment. She\nsmiled, saying that it was a old injury she\nhad suffered during a climbing accident in\nthe fjords of her homeland and whilst her\ndancing days were clearly over she was much better now. At the time, she had\nbeen so badly injured that she could only\nget about with the aid of four sticks. But I was so bewitched by this living loving maid\nthat even her idiosyncratic gait -1 called it\nthe Miss T. Mountain hop - only added to\nher allure, and the more we talked, the\nmore I was smitten. So you can imagine my\ndismay then when she coolly announced that she was soon leaving London for\ngood for more exotic climes. \"Jamaica?\" I asked. She shook her head. She was part\nof a UNHCR team working on flood relief\non the upper reaches of the Indus. Apparently things there were OK at the moment but when the levee breaks, it was going to\nget dicey - hence the need for her rapid\nde par at urc. She was taking a night flight\nwith a little-known Welsh charter company called Bron-Yr-Air, the following Friday. She\nhad chosen that particular a i line, she said,\nbecause of the flexibility of the ticket which\nallowed you to alter your preferred route\nand time of departure right up until the last\nminute. \"Yes\", she said, fixing me with her\npiercing gaze \"there are two paths you can\ngo by but in the long run, there's still time\nto change the road you're on\". But I was-n't listening. Faced with prospect of never\nseeing Truda again I was seized with a sudd en desire to accompany her to Kashmir.\n\"Let me come with you,\" I begged, \"I'm gonna crawl if necessary.\" To my great joy\nshe agreed.\nI got a job at an all-night store and was\nsoon working from seven to eleven every\nnight. It really made my life a drag, which\nI didn't think was right, but finally I had\nenough for the air fare. But fate inter-ve ned. On the appointed day, as I was\npacking my bags, the phone rang. It was\nTruda, at the airport. There had been a change of plan, she said, which meant that\nshe would have to go to Pakistan alone.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she sobbed. 'Thank you, for\neverything.\" I was devastated and through\na veil of tears I poured out my heart to her,\nbegging her to stay, promising her all my\nlove. I was becoming somewhat incoherent at this point and I had to apologise to\nher for not making much sense, saying that\n\"since I 've been loving you I'm about to\nlose my mind.\" But it was too late - the pips\nhad gone and so had she. Happiness had\nbeen within my grasp, but yet it had never\nbeen truly mine - it was a case of what is\nand what should never be.\nI was inconsolable for days but I 'll\nbounce back. Every morning I look in the\nmirror and tell myself \"your time is gonna come.\" That's one thing that the episode\nwith Truda taught me: in this world, you've\ngot to be strong and stand your ground.\nYou've got to learn to be a rock and not to\nroll.\nTicket\nPrice:\n\u00a318\nTrip to France Open to all Booze Cr ooze to Calais Hypermarkets then spend\nthe afternoon in Boulogne.\nSaturday6 th Feb Leave:8 am Be it Quad Tickets available from:\nThe Union Office, or\nn. williams(Sic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "1 February 1999 Arts 25\nBRIEF CANDLE\nNew End Theatre\nC arlo Ardito's blue eyes sparkle\nwhen he explains how he paid\n\u00a31000 for a genuine1890 copy of Marie Bashkirtseff's journals, which after\nyears of obsession - inspired him to write\nhis moving yet very witty play, Brief Candle. Marie Bashkirtseff was a19 th century\nRussian-born, trench-bred painter whose premature death brought her the fame she had always longed for. But one need not know much about this now( sadly\nenough) forgotten artist to appreciate the\nperformance.\nThe play retraces her life from the age of13 when, comfortably secured in\na cocoon of women figures and servants (her mother, aunt, cousin and Misha - all perfectly acted by a strong cast\nfull of complicity), she longs for absolute\nlove and knowledge. Between a few lines of Plato and Shakespeare (her intellectual endeavours are hilarious when it\ncomes to French history!), she flirts with\nDukes and Priests, as well as their hierarchical superiors, the king of Spain and the Pope himself. All the latter are played\nby Denis Quilley, who does a remarkable\njob of switching from one character to\nthe other by way of costume changes. As\nMarie grows into a stunningly beautiful\nwoman \"with the most elegant of skins\",\nshe steers away from her quest for love\nand her father's will for her to marry, perhaps a little disillusioned by her parents\nown marital failure.\nShe stands up to her\nfather by pleading for the equal right of\nwomen to be professional artists. By\nchoosing the arts\n(first music, then painting), Marie not\nonly embraces away of life, but also follows a self-imposed,\nstrenuous discipline\nwhich conflicts with I her frail constitution. I \"Whatever Marie is, jj\nshe is intensely\". M As the play unfolds, we are moved by Marie's wonderful character, played by\nthe talented Celia White, who succeeds in conveying the existential questioning,\nambition, enthusiasm, suffering and sometimes even cruel determination of the young woman. Progressively Marie\nloses her beautiful voice (note the live\nsinging of Tosti's Aprlle by Carol Wells\naccompanied on the piano by Maureen Parry) and then her hearing. She starts\nreflecting on the pointlessness of human endeavours, the wickedness of a supp o sed ly merciful God, and the ironical paradox between\nambition and illness.\nJust as she starts to\ntaste success, Marie\nreaches her ineluctable fate, and dies of tuberculosis.\nHowever and this\nis the moral of the story - art triumphs\nover death since\nBashkirtseff's writings and paintings\ntoday survive. Life,\nafter all, should be a candle cut in four\nand burning at all ends\".\nThe play addresses serious themes,\noften with ironic undertones or outward\nhumour, like the Russian elite in Iran ee during the 19th century, feminism, the\nplace of art in life, the criteria of perfection in painting (Bashkirtseff critically\ndescribes Impressionism - as \"patches\"\nlived like Marie's: which lack precision and area \"great\nmistake\"), the role of religion and the hypocrisy of the clergy. Quillcy brings the\naudience to laughter with his mastery of\nthe nuances of sarcastic in flex ions in his\nvoice, while White brings a refreshing\nyouthful smile to our faces. We never get\nbored by what we hear or see. Director\nStella Quilley's deep concern for minute\ndetails can definitely be sensed, whether\nwith the accessories, the interesting use\nof light and music, the divide of the stage (particularly relevant for the epistolary scene between Marie and the author Guy de Maupassant), or the original presence of a narrator guiding the\nplay. I in ally, the theatre itself is small\nand cosy, with no visibility or acoustics\nproblems. What more can we say, but go and check the play out for yourselves! We thoroughly enjoyed it.\nJenny and Nisha\nUntil 14th February\nNearest tube: I lamp stead Performance times: Tuesday - Saturday\n7.30pm( week-end matinee s3.30pm) Tickets: concessions \u00a37\nNEUROTIC REALISM\nSaatchi Gallery\nother hand, Brian Griffiths' contribution he is the only person on the pictures,\nOsaka, Taylan and Ron is really funny. He often appearing several times on the has used paper plates, milk bottle tops, same shot.

The display is the first instalment in a series promoting the latest\nworks by some of the most forward thinking artists in Britain, some also featured\nin the brilliant Die young Stay pretty show at the ICA, which ended a few weeks ago.\nSteven Gontarski has brought more of his fascinating sculptures made of polyester, PVC and synthetic hair. The shapes are extremely odd, some with a strong sexual feel to them. They are all\ntremendously compelling and quite\nbeautiful. Martin Maloney's work, entitled\nSex Club, is rather different. It focuses on different sexual behaviours of gay men. The paintings are highly explicit, portraying several ways of enacting sadomasochism. A lot of the people looking at these pieces were quite disturbed.\nMaloney's style is particular and this helps\nmock the stereotypes of the things he paints. His technique pays off well and he is very courageous to explore such a touchy subject, usually buried deep underground on the art scene. On the ship. Richard Wilson's20.50 is stunning;\nhe has simply created a pool of oil and the effect is difficult to describe. All I can say is that it's magical and like nothing else I have ever seen. Paul Smith has\ncome up with two sets of photos. The\ninteresting thing about this work is that\ndrunk and being sick in the toilets. The\nother depicts multiple; war scenes where he attempts to show the horrors of vio-len ce. His work is definitely not one of my favourites. Finally, the main room of the gallery is taken up by an enormous installation of Tomo ko Takahashi, who has created a fantastic maze on the floor\nfrom a clatter of rubbish - TV sets, clocks,\nelectrical appliances, type writers, loads\nof paper and stickers... Some of the litter\nis still working so there is an awful noise\nof ticking and banging. It seems like\nlaka hashi wanted to represent a house,\nusing objects from the bathroom and the\nbedroom, others that belong in the gard en or the living room. You can spend\nlots of time just walking around reading\nall the notes on the walls. The overall\nimpression reveals our dependence on technology in everyday life and how we waste so much. This show is unmissable because it\nis yet another indicator of the strong\nand exciting art scene in Britain. These\narc the classics of the future and it is fantastic to witness the making of these\nfascinating new artists.\nD.

OK, so I don't have the final statistics concerning the amount raised (at the time of writing I don't even knowhow Thursday night\nand the Field Cup last Saturday went), but there definitely seemed to be a heightened awareness that it was Rag week around the college. The key, of course, is good publicity in these pages, on posters and flyers around college, and by extremely loud word of mouth. Most of the credit must goto Sarah Coburn and the Rag' team', but some should also goto you, the students - after all, you did much of the raising ( and giving). If only College could have been so proactive and allowed the beer festival togo ahead...\nOn a similar vein, I would like to\ncongratulate my fellow s a bbs Dave, Chris\nand Marie, for raising awareness of the forthcoming sabbatical elections. They\nhave been rewarded by six students standing for positions. Hopefully more will follow. Good luck to Dave Hellard in\nthe Slave Auction, by the way may he be bought for a president's ransom and the money used to further increase his\noffice space.

I now almost always carry around a mobile phone, minidisc player/ recorder, microphone, and camera. I spend half\nof my day in front of a keyboard typing (as I'm currently demonstrating), i attempted to fill up a postgraduate application form the other day, and made a mistake for every ten words written.
