I\u2019m most proud\nof the Union Sports Strategy and\nActivities Development Fund which\nwill create more opportunities for\nstudent activities in the future.\nTop Four Favourite Colours?\n1 \u2013 Algae Green, 2 \u2013 Pine Green, 3 \u2013\nShamrock Green, 4 \u2013 Avocado Green.\nGreen things make me happy! The\nGreen Huntsman Spider evokes mixed\nemotions but looks amazing\nBest thing you\u2019ve done this year?\nThis would be the Student Consultation\nFramework that I developed. This is a\ndocument, produced through extensive\nconsultation with College staff and\nstudents, which sets a standard for\nhow students should be consulted on\nchanges that affect them.\nWill you lobby the College to\ndevelop halls in Hyde Park?\nHow absurd! However I did rally time\nand time again for the occupation of\nKensington Palace and its gardens.\nUnfortunately the College consistently\nsided with the royals and defeated every\none of our Constituent Union armies.\nBest thing you\u2019ve done this year?\nTom was busy and unable to come back\nto us. However he has had a successful\nyear as the chair of the Recreational\nClubs Committee and of course won\nthe Presidential election. - Ed.\nWhat was Tom up to instead?\nTom was probably chopping wood in a\nforest somewhere, saving children from\nfatal accidents or moving frantically\nup and down while trying to avoid\nprotruding pipes. We wish him well -Ed.\nBest thing you\u2019ve done this year?\nProbably having dinner with Professor\nLord Robert Winston - it was definitely\nthe highlight of a lot of hard lobbying\nwork over the Immigration Bill. It was\npretty incredible to hang out in the\nHouse of Lords and watch the debate.\nHow much do you like Cyan and\nMagenta?\nGenuinely the names of my future\nchildren.\nBest thing you\u2019ve done this year?\nAbigail was busy with exams and\nunavailable for comment. As Tour\nManager of IC Sinfonietta and a keen\nmartial artist she was elected as next\nyear\u2019s DPCS. Good luck Abigail! - Ed.\nWhat was Abigail up to instead?\nAside from exams we think Abigail\nwas either conducting chemistry\nexperiments galore, demonstrating\nher martial arts experience on club\n\u201cnaughty officers\u201d who failed to pass the\n\u201cKey Information\u201d quiz or practising\nfor a summer concert - Ed.\nHow do you think the Union can\nimprove?\nThe Union can improve by trusting\nthe intelligence of its members to make\ndecisions about their own lives.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite thing about\nMetric?\nThe thing like most about Metric is that\nI can be totally and utterly safe there\nthanks to the Safe Space Policy.

    "content": "FRIDAY 20 JUN\n20 ARTS & CULTURE\nIn an abandoned swimming pool\nsomewhere in the northern perimeter\nof Berlin, lights burst to the rhythm\nof acoustic ricochets. A bizarre\nchoreography of light and sound\nimitates patterns of synchrony and\npredation found in the animal kingdom.\nThe source of this erratic audiovisual\nexperience is a self-aware system of 200\nnodes, comprised of 50 loudspeakers and\n150 LEDs. Coupled with microphones\nand photodiodes, respectively, each unit,\nor \u2018agent\u2019, extends a field of awareness that\ncan sense itself as well as its surroundings.\nThe audiovisual patterns that emerge\nfrom the amalgam resemble a cybernetic\nelectroacoustic organism that entrances\nvisitors and lures them to the deep end of\nthe pool.\nn_polytope is a sound art\ninstallation designed and built by a team\nof artists, engineers and researchers at\nConcordia Univerity in Montreal, Canada,\nand was now set up for the 15th edition of\nBerlin\u2019s Club Transmediale Festival (CTM)\nfor \u201cadventurous music & art\u201d. Taking place\nover an entire week, in venues across\nthe city, CTM gathers the avant-garde in\nelectronic and experimental music in the\npresent day, as well as paying homage\nto the pioneers of the 20\u00ad\n\u00ad\nth\nCentury. This\ninstallation in particular was inspired by\nthe \u2018polytopes\u2019 of Greek engineer-turned-composer Iannis Xenakis, which sought\nto synthesize multisensory environments\nof light and sound, which surrounded\naudiences in complex architectures of cable\ngeometries. n_polytope extends Xenakis\u2019s\nideas of stochastic sound synthesis and\nacoustic architectures by making use of\nmodern algorithms in machine learning and\ndistributed artificial neural networks.\nI spoke with Chris Salter (Director of\nMontreal\u2019s Hexagaram-Concordia Centre\nfor Research and Creation in Media Art\nand Technology) and Marije Baalman\n(ex-postdoc at Hexagram and currently\na hardware engineer and freelance\nartist at Amsterdam\u2019s STEIM (Studio for\nElectro-Instrumental Music)) about the\ntechnological and philosophical aspects of\nthe installation, which was put together by a\nwider team of collaborators in architectural\ndesign, laser systems, programming and\nelectronics.\n\u00cd\u00f1igo: How did you quantify the\nawareness of the individuals within the\nsystem?\nChris Salter: Well, it\u2019s a really simple system.\nYouhaveanLEDandyouhavealightsensor.\nSo the sensor can see itself, and then that\nawareness runs over an RL (Reinforcement\nLearning) algorithm and the RL runs over\na neural network. So what he was trying to\nfigure out is that when it does an action,\nhow does it change its environment? Well\nof course it could change its environment by\ndoing the action again, so it gets feedback.\nSo the sensor is a very primitive sensory-motor system. It learns to do something,\nright? Usually these systems settle into some\nminima. The light flickers, and then it finds\na steady state. Either it stays on, or it goes\noff. Usually it stays on.\nSo what happens then if you change the\nenvironment and you turn the lights off in\nthe room? Then it has to relearn, because\nall the conditions have changed. Or you\nsuddenly blitz it with a strobe, or a flash, or\nsomething. Then it starts up again and tries\nto relearn again. So if you continually change\nits environment, then it\u2019s constantly trying to\nadapt, so it may never get into a steady state.\nSo that was one of [Sofian\u2019s] tests. So then\nwe thought about how to build this form of\nbehaviours and systems, on a larger scale.\nAnd I knew from the start that the algorithms\nwere complicated so that these things would\ntalk to each other.\nWe started with the basic idea that you\nhave a lot of different agents, and they all start\nat different times. So, for instance, one of the\nalgorithms he runs is a \u2018firefly\u2019 model, so\nthe agents attempt to synchronize with each\nother. Once they eventually synchronize,\nthey then stay synchronized for a period\nof time, and then either desynchronize or\nremain in a steady state. So that\u2019s one of the\nalgorithms we\u2019re running. You have to tweak\nthese reward functions all the time. You have\nno idea really \u2013 the system doesn\u2019t really\nknow what it\u2019s doing. It just knows, \u201cOh,\nthat\u2019s an interesting action, I got that reward,\nI got this number and I\u2019ll do that again.\u201d\nThese learning systems are not very good as\ngenerative systems, but we\u2019re trying to use\nthem in that way, and to produce generative\nbehaviours as opposed to trying to get to a\ncertain task that it will then be able to repeat.\nI: So does it fall into sequential states?\nNot a steady state, but a sort of\narrhythmic behaviour?\nC: Sometimes, but we also do a lot to\nconstrain the system. Like, which nodes\nare active at one point, or what region\nspatially; or how long are they active in a\ngiven sequence; or do they all start at the\nsame time and then drift? For instance, they\nhave this one algorithm which is a \u2018chasing\u2019\nmodel. So the idea is that the agent gets a\nreward for staying away from the other agent.\nOf course it\u2019s crossing into the agent all the\ntime because it doesn\u2019t really know. So at\nwhat time it learns \u2018OK\u2026 I\u2019m colliding with\nthe other agent, and I\u2019m getting punished,\nso I\u2019ll try to stay a little further away.\u2019 We\u2019d\nmap that in terms of the speed of which the\nflashes happen on these lines. It\u2019s a question\nof whether you see spatial patterns or\ntemporal patterns, because people look for\nspatial things \u2013 if I see the shape again and\nagain it means it\u2019s not a random system. If\nI sense very simple rhythms or pulses\u2026 once\nit gets to polyrhythmic it gets very complex\nsince it\u2019s not very good at rhythm.\nI: Like trying to understand which\ncar\u2019s blinkers are going faster than the\nother\u2019s?\nC: Right. And of course, the brain has\nextremely interesting temporal properties -how all these neurons start synchronizing\nwith each other to form some notion of\nperception that we have, which is way, way\nhigher level than this. So Xenakis, whose\nwork this piece is based on, was trained as\nan architect, trained as an engineer, but also\nas a composer. He came out of a period\nwhere in the sciences, thermodynamics\nand statistical mechanics were the main\nconcern\u2026 he was interested in micro and\nmacro properties and Boltzmann models of\ngases and so on. So he used those models\nin his composition (Poisson distributions,\netc.). He wanted probabilistic models, he\nwanted stochastic music, he didn\u2019t want\ndeterministic models. He wasn\u2019t interested\nin determinism, he was interested in control.\nHe was interested in not the kind of linear\npolyphony of what the serial composers in\nthe 1950s were doing, where everything was\ndeterministic, based on tone rows, and so\non. He was actually interested in patterns\nlike what happens when, in a riot, suddenly\nsomeone starts yelling and then it picks up\nand spreads, exhibiting a kind of swarm\nbehaviour. Or like the patterns of raindrops\nfalling on surfaces. So it was the idea of\nsound as a mass, or a cloud, or grains.\nEditors: Riaz Agahi music.felix@gmail.com\nMUSIC & ART\nN_Polytope: Behaviours in Light\n& Sound After Iannis Xenakis\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto in conversation with artist Chris Salter and engineer Marije Baalman\n\n"

Some are so bad that they\u2019re good in retrospect (though some\nare just bad), and sometimes being a GTA makes you so happy that you can\u2019t help but love your job. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster first year as a\nGTA, and I\u2019ve definitely learnt some valuable lessons (such as not to get too drunk the night before a field trip abroad), but I don\u2019t think I\ndid a bad job. Here are my highlights and lowlights of the year, as well as the best and worst experiences I had with GTAs when I was an\nundergrad.\nThe best and the worst of gta-ing\nAS A GTA\n1. Having my tutorial students ask whether I\u2019ll be their tutor next year.\nHonestly guys, you made my year. I\u2019ll do my best!\n2. Being told by a student that before the class, he wanted to kill himself\nover the topic, but by the end, he definitely thought that he could figure\nit out for the exam. At least their level of understanding increased, even\nif mine was still hopelessly poor!\n3. Getting hit on by a student, during one of his final exams. Seriously\nman, don\u2019t you have better things to be doing than making eyes at me\nfor hours?\n4. Spending ages helping a struggling student with something really\nfundamental, then seeing them go off and do it independently. Bonus\npoints for the student whose work I recognised when I was marking their\nexam, being better than I could ever do it myself.\n5. Being paid to do nothing but watch on so many\nfield trips, but make sure the students didn\u2019t kill\nthemselves. Okay, that one time that one student\ndid nearly die, but he didn\u2019t, and it was just once\u2026\n6. Being awkwardly stuck between being a student\nand a lecturer. You get to drink with both and hear\nwhat they each have to say about the other, which\nalways give you the best stories to tell.\n7. Watching final year students sitting their exams,\nknowing that you got through this already, and\nyou have absolutely nothing to prove anymore.\n8. Seeing a struggling student have an epiphany in\nan exam and start scribbling furiously. Oh, I know that feel.\n9. Looking really popular when walking through my department. No-one\nneeds to know that all these people saying hello to me are my students,\nnot my friends.\n10. Automatically gaining a whole load of friends (usually MSc students)\nto hang out with after a weekend of bonding on a field trip.\nTHE\nBEST\nAS A STUDENT\n1. The magic GTA who made Fluids make far more sense than the\nlecturer ever did\n2. When the GTA I spent all term falling in love with asked me a question\nand told me I was doing a good job. I still love you, demonstrator with\nthe dinosaur watch <3\n3. When my group project was saved by a GTA, when they really didn\u2019t\nhave to.\nTHE\nBEST\nAS A STUDENT\n1. The GTA I had in my first year who would consistently ignore me,\nand talk only to my male lab partner, even when he was answering my\nquestions. Last year, he hit on me. Not cool.\n2. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d guy. I relate to him now, but he really took it too\nfar. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to throw a confused student a bone.\n3. An invigilator standing behind my shoulder for an entire exam,\nbreathing his smelly breath down my neck. To say this was distracting\nwould be an understatement.\nTHE\nWORST\nAS A GTA\n1. Being approached and asked out by a student after class. Sure, we may\nbe friends for the purpose of a class or a field trip, but you\u2019re 18, there is\nzero chance that I will consider making you a regular part of my social life.\nDon\u2019t embarrass me in front of my real friends!\n2. After invigilating an exam, when the entire class of students claimed\nto have left the room for ten minutes, without my noticing. Luckily, the\nsenior tutor didn\u2019t find this believable\u2026\n3. GTAing for a practical chemistry lab when I was so\nhungover that I couldn\u2019t hold the bottle of HF steady.\nAll of the students had done the lab before and clearly\nknew it better than me \u2013 no-one wanted to be there.\n4. Realising when drunk and in Soho at 1am that I had\nto GTA at 9am, for a problems class that I\u2019ve never\nstudied or even looked at the subject material. What\nfollowed was the worst three hours of my life, as I\nhastily googled every single question I was asked.\nNo-one bought it.\n5. While idly checking my phone when my students\nwere working something out, I received some bad\nnews, but had to keep teaching and hold it together\nfor another two hours. It\u2019s a fine line in GTAing\nbetween informal teaching, and still being professional.\n6. Having to give a tutorial or teach a class that you signed up for months\nago\u2026 without realising that it would clash with a huge deadline from your\nsupervisor. When we\u2019re snowed under with work, the last thing we want\nto do is teach you how to solve differential equations.\n7. Realising halfway through a problems class that you\u2019ve misunderstood\nthe topic, and have been explaining something incorrectly for the last\nhour. It is with a deep sense of shame and regret that you backtrack\nthrough everyone you\u2019ve spoken to with the correct answer.\n8. Running into your students in the bathroom, or worst, out and about. The\nyoung ones, especially, don\u2019t embrace the social etiquette of awkwardly\nwalking 20 feet apart to avoid any awkward extended conversations.\n9. Being told that a question is simply impossible by a student in an exam,\nwhen you can clearly see that they have all the information that they\nneed. Either you want to tell them that they\u2019re stupid, or they look so\nhelpless that you want to give them a clue; but remaining ambiguous is\nso frustrating!\n10. The many hours long, mindlessly boring, irrelevant training that we\u2019re\nforced to sit through at the beginning of the year. The majority of us aren\u2019t\neven responsible for imparting any original knowledge, why teach us to\ndo it? It\u2019s enough to put a naive PhD student off teaching for life!\nTHE\nWORST\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\nteabagordie.com\n\n"

Have a stab in the dark.\nI was amazed to find out that despite huge\nproblems with illicit substance abuse, and having\nbeen hospitalised previously for an overdose of\nheroin, ecstasy, cocaine and ketamine, there was nothing\nillegal about the substance that eventually killed her: alcohol.\nOf course, the Daily Mail jumped to conclusions when\ninitially reporting on the story.\nI\u2019ve just finished reading David Nutt\u2019s Drugs Without The\nHot Air, and it blew me away how little I knew about drugs\n(including alcohol and tobacco). I was amazed to the point\nwhere I felt I needed to encourage more people to read it. It\nturns out the drugs education you receive at school is shite\nand politicians/the media purvey unscientific nonsense.\nDavid Nutt is the Edward J Safra chair of\nNeuropsychopharmacology at the fine institution of\nImperial College London but you may know him as the\ngovernment advisor who was sacked for making comments\ncomparing the dangers of illegal substance to the dangers\nof legal activities such as horse riding and drinking alcohol.\nThe internet doesn\u2019t need another review from some 21\nyear old kid when The Economist and The Huffington Post\nhave already got that down. I just thought I would relay\nsome of the findings in it that surprised and fascinated me.\nIf you find them unbelievable, I advise you to think where\nyour current knowledge of drugs and drug users comes from;\nfor me it was Breaking Bad and The Sopranos. These statistics\nand facts are of course out of context (go read the book)\nbut I\u2019ve tried to be fair when taking them out. Finally, the\nsources of these facts are all cited in the book but I haven\u2019t\nchecked them out. [Most of them, I have \u2013 ed.]\nOn the comparison of legal and illegal activities:\nOn average, a horse rider can expect a serious accident\nevery 350 hours riding. An ecstasy user can expect a case of\nacute harm once every 10,000 pills (Chapter 2).\nTobacco has 7,000,000 users in the UK and cocaine has\n700,000. Cocaine is responsible for 250 deaths a year and\nTobacco is responsible for 100,000 (page 196).\nThis is how the ISCD ranked drugs, based on harm to the\nuser and to society, based on 16 different factors (page 43):\nOn Tobacco:\nThe World Health Organisation has estimated that\ntobacco will account for 10% of all deaths worldwide by 2015\n(page 194).\nTobacco-related health problems cost \u00a313.7 billion per\nyear. Cigarette taxes generate \u00a310 billion per year (page 194).\nIt\u2019s only because popular culture is saturated with positive\nimages of people smoking and because friends encourage\nit that anyone smokes a second cigarette. Their first is\nusually unenjoyable. Compare this with LSD and ecstasy\nwhere some people can go as far as to say their first pill was\npositively life-altering (page 201).\nOn Legal Highs:\nOf the dozens of deaths that were reported as due to\nmephedrone (MMCAT) in 2009, only two have been\nconfirmed as being directly and solely caused by the drug.\nHowever, it may have had a net effect of saving lives overall\nas people switched from cocaine to mephedrone. There were\n95 cocaine deaths in the first half of 2008 which reduced to\n66 in the first half of 2009 (page 117).\nOn Politicians:\nBarack Obama was a regular cannabis smoker in his\nyounger years and has even admitted to trying cocaine\nbefore he came to office (page 135).\nIn 2002, an ambitious UK backbencher called David\nCameron said in a debate in the House of Commons that\n\u201cdrugs policy has been failing for decades\u201d. Yet now he\u2019s\nPrime Minister he gives the same \u2018tough on drugs\u2019 spiel of\nevery other politician (page 281).\nWhen Cameron was caught with cannabis at Eton he was\nmade to write out hundreds of lines of Latin (page 286).\nCompare this to the punishment of prison which costs\n\u00a338,000 a year to keep someone in, and which usually turns\ninmates onto harder drugs (also page 286).\nOn the international war on drugs:\nAl Qaeda is principally funded by opium and cannabis\nproduction (page 277).\nThere were 15,000 deaths due to the crackdown in Mexican\ncartels in 2010 alone (page 190).\nEvery gram of cocaine snorted in England will have been\nresponsible for an area of four square metres of rainforest\nbeing destroyed (page 189).\nThe illicit drugs trade is about 1% of the global economy,\nuntaxed and unregulated (page 276).\nOn the difficulty of conducting research with illegal\ndrugs in mental health therapy:\nMental health is the biggest health burden in Europe\ntoday, costing more than heart disease and cancer combined\n(page 227).\nA recent study of subject with chronic, treatment-resistant\nPTSD resulted in an 83% success rate \u2013 ten out of twelve\nsubjects essentially no longer had the disorder after two\nsessions of ecstasy-assisted psychotherapy (page 25).\nOn how LSD can deliver moments of inspiration:\nKary Mullis, who won the Nobel prize for inventing the\npolymerase chain reaction, went as far as to say \u201cwould I\nhave invented PCR if I hadn\u2019t taken LSD? I seriously doubt\nit [having taken LSD] I could sit on a DNA molecule and\nwatch the polymers go by. I learnt that partly on psychedelic\ndrugs.\u201d (page 258).\nI could carry on to the point where I\u2019ve typed out the\nwhole book, but just go read it. Even if you\u2019ve never taken\nan illegal drug, it will probably make you think again about\nalcohol and make you enraged at how much politicians have\nto pander to Daily Mail-reading middle classes who have\nnever taken a drug or met an addict who think prohibition\nis possible.\nJack Peacock\n@ JackPeacock\nI KNEW NOTHING ABOUT DRUGS UNTIL I\nREAD THIS BOOK\nDrugs Without the Hot Air / David Nutt\nThe 20 Drugs\nconsidered in\nthe ISCD\u2019s 2010\nreport, ranked by\noverall harm.\nDrugs Without\nthe Hot\nAir\n\n"

Four turns in, he\u2019s already on\ntriple figures and has a lead of 39. Scanning\nover my tiles through a subconscious face\npalm, I mutter something about being in\ntouching distance. \u201cQuite close,\u201d says Lewis,\nseemingly getting the emollient comments\nin early before the gap becomes unassailable.\n\u201cWhat do your mates make SCRABBLE?\nAre you converting them?\u201d I ask as I play\nGLORY, with no small hint of irony, for\na piddly nine points. \u201cAll of them are very\ngood at sport\u201d, he tells me in his gentle\nAntipodean drawl. \u201call my friends play at\nleast three sports. I only play\u2026.\u2019 He pauses\na moment. \u201cIf you count SCRABBLE as a\nsport, I only play two.\u201d The other, he tells\nme, is soccer, rarely taking his eyes off the\ntiles as he plays BONNETS.\nIf the systematic dismantling I was suffering\nat the hands of Lewis wasn\u2019t bad enough,\nthe rate at which he did it was alarming.\nEvery so often I remember that Lewis is in\nprimary school. I struggle to remember what\nmy primary school years were like. It puts\ninto perspective how mature Lewis is for his\nage, with a level of focus that many adults\nwould aspire to.\n\u201cHave you ever played SCRABBLE\nbefore?\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell if this was innocent\nconversation from the pint-sized kiwi or\nexquisite chutzpah, but either way, I cracked.\nDespite being away from the cloying smoke\nof the bar cellar and (as far as I could tell)\nwith the last of the pivo out my system, the\nwave of nauseous panic returned. My pupils\ndilated, my pulse quickened. Beyond the\nboard, the world blurred into nothingness\nand my focus closed down to the rack.\nIt was just me and these seven tiles, and\nI was getting beaten by an eight year old.\nAlbeit modern SCRABBLE\u2019s answer to an\neight-year-old Mozart but I was getting beat\nnonetheless and, a handful of turns in, it\nwas looking to be a hiding.\nSomething needed to be done.\nSUZE. SUZE was my only option.\nWith a \u2018Z\u2019 on my rack, I needed to make\nit count and SUZE was the only way I could\nplay it and land on a triple word score. The\nonly issue was that I had just pulled SUZE\nout of thin air.\nMy mind became a flurry of thoughts \u2013\ncrepe suzette, suzerainty, Peep Show\u2019s Big\nSuze \u2013 as I scrabbled the recesses of my\nmind for a shred of authenticity. I was losing\nto an eight year old and my only option was\nto try made-up words.\nSitting back in my chair and\npulling the best look of\nnonchalance I could\nmuster, I slapped down\nSUZE for a whopping\n43. For a moment\nLewis was silent. He\nlooked at the board,\nthen down at his\nrack and then back\nto the board. He\ncould challenge and\nI\u2019d be rumbled, my\nSUZE ruse would\nbe up. Seemingly\nunflapped by my\nspeculative SUZE, he\ncounters with DETAIN. I\nlive to fight another rack.\nIt\u2019s been a busy schedule for\nLewis so far, he\u2019s been here a week and\nplayed both days of the last chance qualifier\nfor the SCT and every day of the open\ntournament that has been run concurrently\nfor those who failed to make the main event.\nI\u2019ve done well to have him squeeze me in\nbefore his day\u2019s play begins proper. He is\nmore than just figuratively having me for\nbreakfast.\nHe came very close to making the SCT\nhimself: of the three under-18 entrants in\nthe last chance qualifier, one was guaranteed\nentry. Over the course of his eight games he\nwas drawn against neither of the other two\nbut they played each other, one beating the\nother by a monstrous margin and skewing\nthe rankings in the favour of the victor. Lewis\nwas effectively frozen out of contention.\nAny sense of disappointment can\u2019t have\nlasted too long. I later discovered that at the\nWorld Youth SCRABBLE Championship\nin Dubai (his next stop after Prague) he won\nthe prize for best player in both his own age\ncategory and the one above.\nLAVE stares back at me from my rack and\nfeeling a little cocky from my\nclose shave with SUZE,\nI throw caution to the\nwind once again. I\nask him if he has\nany favourite\nwords, to see\nif he can top\nthe tale of\nZYGANTRA\none of the\nE n g l i s h\nplayers had\ntold me the\nday before.\n\u201cThis word,\u201d he\nsays, scribbling\nit down on the\nsheet we\u2019re using for\nscoring, \u201cThis is my\nfavourite word I played in\nthe tournament\u201d. I look at it and\nbaulk. TAENIAE. All of a sudden SUZE\ndon\u2019t seem all that bad. \u201cDo you know what\nit means?\u201d I ask, now weary of disconnect\nbetween spelling and definition in the\nSCRABBLE player\u2019s consciousness. Lewis\ngives a little mute shake of his head, before\nchallenging my LAVE.\nAny word can be challenged in a game of\nSCRABBLE, the clocks are stopped and\nthe dictionary, automated into a computer\nsearch bar, is consulted. To my amazement,\nit checks out and gifts me a further five\npoints. I would\u2019ve felt worse about so blindly\nguessing against a soon-to-be nine year old,\nbut his margin stood not far off triple digits\nand it had dried up any pool of sympathy\nthat might have been welling inside of me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting quite tense.\u201d I say, mopping\nliteral sweat off my brow. \u201cNot really\u201d comes\nthe response. Clearly when you\u2019re used to\nspanking septuagenarians with TAENIAE,\nlosing five points to me on a challenge barely\nregisters. I, however, was jubilant.\nI ask Lewis if he thinks he could one day be\nWorld Champion. He hums a brief moment\nof deliberation, before admitting \u2018probably\nnot\u2019. I wouldn\u2019t be so pessimistic about his\nchances. Starting so young, his mind will be\na sponge to all that rote learning of words\nthat forms the mainstay of competitive\nSCRABBLE. Assuming he navigates his\nformative years with the same level head he\u2019s\nshown me over the past half hour, come an\nadult, he\u2019d be at a huge advantage.\nPicking up the blank, he plays BANTING\nfor 65 and cheekily reminds me I can\nchallenge if I want. The word doesn\u2019t spark\neven a glimmer of recognition but keen\nto avoid falling for his ploy, I play on. A\nfew more outrageously hopeful words by\nme (PAISE apparently is allowed) Lewis\nrounds off the game, winning 372-273. As I\npant a relieved sigh at managing to keep the\ndifference within double digits (the marker\nof respectability, I tell myself) Lewis is\nalready picking at the tiles, working out what\nother plays could have been made.\nI scan over the scoresheet and finally ask\nhim for his autograph. Some how, I doubt\nit\u2019ll be his last.\nFelix / Max Hunter\n\n"

    "content": "35\nFRIDAY 20 JUN GAMES & TECH\nSECTION BATTLE ROYALE\nRecently EA announced a closed\nbeta for its newest instalment in its\nBattlefield franchise. All you needed\nto do (and still can do at battlefield.\ncom/hardline/beta) was give in\nyour details and hope that EA\ndecided to pick you. To be honest\nwith you, I would honestly go for\nit. You only lose about 2 minutes\nof your time, and potentially get to\ntest a triple-A title for zilch. I mean,\nwhat do you have to lose?\nAnyway, I was lucky enough to\nbe chosen for the Beta, (although I\nbelieve that pretty much everyone\nis chosen) and immediately went\nto download the game from origin.\nThe interface itself is very similar\nto battlefield 4 in that you have do\neverything pre-game through your\nbrowser. You have a profile, loadout\nand can choose your server/game\nmode there.\nThe setting of Battlefield\nHardline is basically cops versus\nrobbers. However, add into that\ntried and tested formula the guns\nand mechanics of the Battlefield\nseries, and you should get a really\ngood game! Currently since we are\nBattlefield Hardline\nA serious review by Maximilian Eggl on the latest Battlefield game beta\nin beta the game only has two game\nmodes, namely Blood money and\nheist. Blood money is a really fun\ncapture the flag mode where you\nhave to steal money from a neutral\nsafe and bring it back to your own.\nAt the same time you can steal\nfrom the other sides safe, while\nthey can do the same to you. Heist\ndescription\nI played several rounds of this\nmode and was really satisfied. The\ngun play from Battlefield, which\nwas ok to begin really melded\nwell with the concept of the game\nmode. I found it really enjoyable\nwhen I was stealing the cash, the\nadrenaline was rushing as I waited\nthere to pick up the cash and I\nwas elated when I managed to take\nsomeone down who was about to\nrake in big time. Furthermore, the\ntactics of this game mode are wide-ranging and can be completely\ndifferent. For example you can play\nextremely aggressively, camping out\nyour opponents safe and kill them\nevery time they try to bring money\nthere, or extremly defensively by\njust defending your own safe. All in\nall it made for a really good gaming\nexperience.\nThe heist game mode is similar,\nbut instead of both teams needing\nto steal money from a safe, we\nhave the robbers needing to crack\na safe and then carry the flag for a\nset amount of time. The cops need\nto stop the robbers from doing this.\nSimultaneously the robbers have a\nlimited number of respawns, while\nthe cops can die as many times as\nthey want. I found this mode really\ngood as well, however I think that\neven just a little teamwork would\nmake this way better. However, as\nalways battlefield players are quite a\nselfish bunch.\nIn terms of new content, apart\nfrom the game modes, we have the\naddition of new meelee weapons,\nlike police batons and baseball bats.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of a\nriot shield which stops most bullets\nreally is different from what we have\nseen before. The best addition in\nmy opinion though is the grappling\nhook and a zipline. This gives\nthe already interesting movement\noptions a new dimension which\ncan lead to completely new tactics\nto take out your enemies.\nAll in all considering that this\ngame is in beta, as well as being\nactually a quite demanding game I\nwas really impressed by how well it\nran. Very rarely did I have any lag\nor performance issues. Everything\nwas really smooth and looked really\ngood.\nFelix Books\nThe books section while rather\nentertaining, when reviewing the\nwalk through guides of various\ngames (which it does too rarely),\nstill lacks that heavy gaming\ninfluence that for instance the\ngaming section possesses. The\neditor-in-chief himself remarked:\n\u201cI really like gaming, gaming\nis fun.\u201d Which completely\nsupports the idea that he wants\nto revamp the books section, and\nrename it to the Walkthrough\nBooks section, furthermore\ngiving the already overworked\ngames section team (who were\nincredibly successful) the job of\nincrease the readership.\nFelix Sports\nLast week the Felix Sports\nSabrecats came up against the\nGaming Giants. After failing to\nscore a single point, the Sabrecats\nwere ruthlessly destroyed when\nthe Giant\u2019s Skene entered the fray.\nFurthermore a dismal display by\nSabrecat\u2019s captain Wagle just\nwent to show that the Giants were\nsuperior to the Sabrecats. After\nthis humiliating loss owner of\nboth franchises, Editor-in-chief\nJoe Letts said that \u201cI really like\ngaming, gaming is fun.\u201d, thereby\nsacking the entire Sabrecats\nplayers, and instating the Giants\nteam as a dual team taking over\nthe roles of both.\nFelix Catnip\nLonely catnip editor looking\nfor a games editor to make\nher section better. He must be\ncreative with design, have a heavy\nfocus on gaming, and be able to\nwrite good articles in a pinch. I,\nmyself, am in charge of a rather\nunknown section trying to get\nmore exposure and readers.\nStarting out with a co-editorship\nwith a possible move into senior\neditorship possible (winky face).\nEditor-in-chief himself said, \u201cI\nreally like gaming, gaming is\nfun\u201d, meaning he is more than\nhappy to finally get this section\noff the ground, and actually\ngetting people to meet up.\nFelix Hangman\nHey hangman editor here. I have\nmanaged to change the games editors\nreview of my section before it went to\nprint. They said that hangman would\nbe better if it made fun of gaming.\nNo effing way. Gaming section is\nthe worst section, and I would rather\nwipe read bad poetry than set my\neyes upon that tripe. In fact, you\nknow what, gaming could do with\na bit more hangman. So from next\nyear onwards the gaming section\nwill now be known as the gameman\nsection, horoscopes, bad jokes and\nbeing really unfunny, just like the\nreal hangman section! In fact, the\nFelix editor himself said, \u201cI really like\nhangman, hangman is fun.\u201d\nHowever, if we remember that\nBattlefield was released less than a\nyear ago, should EA be bringing out\nthe sequel? I honestly have to say\nno. Battlefield 4 was a mess when\nit came out, and still occasionally\nsuffers from bugs and glitches.\nHardline proves that Dice can\nactually bring out a well-optimized\ngame that runs well, so why hasn\u2019t\nthis been applied to Battlefield 4?\nWhy release an entirely new game\nfor an outrageous price, when the\nengine is the same, most of the\nmechanics are the same and there\nis relatively little content. To be\nhonest, I really think that it would\nbe better if Dice had released\nthis game as a DLC, and I would\nperhaps be more inclined to buy\nit. However, for to be paying the\nwhole \u00a360 or whatever it will cost\nis really ridiculous considering I\nalready have Battlefield 4. I am\nsorry EA, but regardless of how\ngood Hardline is, I will not fall\nfor your money making schemes.\nShame really, because as an add-on\nI would have definitely bought it\nand advised others to get it as well.\nwww.wikipedia.org\n\n"

The book was incredibly\nwell-received, more so than any\nof Green\u2019s other efforts (which\nremain beloved in their own\nways), with the response to it being\nof such a magnitude that a film\nadaptation was almost inevitable.\nBut with the path to adaptation\ncomes the valley of hatchet jobs, a\nvalley where so many books have\nfallen previously.\nThe Fault in Our Stars, fortunately,\nmanages to navigate said\nmetaphorical valley with aplomb,\nthanks to a combination of winning\nfactors: the heavy involvement\nof the author (Green was on set\nvirtually every day), a dedicated\nteam of producers in all their\nmulti-titled guises with an eye on\nmaking the best film possible while\nkeeping the budget through the\nfloor, a knock-out cast featuring\nShailene Woodley at a point where\nher star can only continue to rise,\nand known, successful quantities\nin the screenwriters and director\n(note \u2018successful\u2019, not \u2018great\u2019 \u2013\nNeustatder and Weber are the duo\nresponsible for (500) Days of Summer,\nwhich was unavoidably successful\nbut of questionable merit).\nAll these factors collide to make\na film that is unquestionably a\nperfect adaptation of the source\ntext. The cast are incredible,\nnailing every single emotional\nbeat (if not adding something\nmore to each of them), with\none particular scene involving\nHazel\u2019s (Woodley) parents\nproving far harder-hitting that\nits textual counterpart, thanks\nin no small part to Laura Dern\u2019s\nperformance as Hazel\u2019s mother.\nThe story follows the same\npath, the same beats, using\nthem to great effect to wring the\nmaximum volume of tears out\nof its audience. Unfortunately,\nthe preview screening I saw\nachieved this effect to such a\ndegree that it was hard to hear\nsome of the film over the crying\n\u2013 speaks volumes for how\neffective it was, I suppose.\nOf course, this does mean that\nany problems with the book are\npresent and magnified on the\nbig screen \u2013 a scene in the Anne\nFrank house, while obviously\nthematically resonant (I love\nthat phrase, it\u2019s so meaningless)\nWe\u2019re gonna die young\nEditors: John Park (Film & TV), Emily Fulham (TV) news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOn The Box \u2013 Film & TV\nThe Fault in Our\nStars\nDirector: Josh Boone\nWriters: Scott Neustadter,\nMichael H.

The direction is\nuninspired, taking the obvious\nroute for every single shot and\ndoing nothing of any real interest\n(yes, obviously in some scenes\nthe obvious route is the right\none, but not in all of them), while\nthe soundtrack choices are so\npainfully routine and obvious it\u2019s\nalmost unbearable. If you went\naway, made a Spotify playlist of\nclich\u00e9d songs you\u2019d expect in a\nfilm like this, and brought it back,\nI could guarantee you at least\nhalf of those songs would make\nan appearance here.\nIt feels weird to be complaining\nabout a film playing it safe and\nsettling for simple doing what\nit should be doing, and doing\nit competently \u2013 it\u2019s certainly\na step up from doing it badly,\nafter all \u2013 but it really does\nfeel like a problem here. The\ncast are stellar, there\u2019s no two\nways around it, and the story\u2019s\na strong one if you\u2019re prepared\nto invest in the characters. The\ndirection and music being found\nwanting just makes it all feel like\na missed opportunity. And that \u2013\nmore than anything I saw in the\nfilm \u2013 is what really upsets me.\nSummer musicals\nClint Eastwood directs his first-ever musical film, Jersey Boys (released 20th\nJune), based on the Tony-winning Broadway hit stage production of the\nsame name. The story is of how Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons\ncame together to become the singing sensation of the 1960s. Reviews have\nbeen mixed at best, although fans of the singers are guaranteed to have a\ngood time, with hit songs such as \u2018Sherry\u2019, \u2018Walk Like a Man\u2019, and \u2018Can\u2019t\nTake My Eyes Off You\u2019 making their appearances, sung by musically\ntrained actors, not just film actors trying to sing to fit the role.\nThink of this as the cheaper, tackier version of Mamma Mia, as if such\na thing could be achieved. Mamma Mia took the best of Abba and made\na stage musical out of it, which was then turned into a film, but with\nWalking on Sunshine (released 27th June) it jumps straight into making\na film out of the greatest hits of the 80s. \u2018How Do I Know\u2019, \u2018Venus\u2019, \u2018The\nPower of Love\u2019, \u2018If I Could Turn Back Time\u2019, \u2018Wake Me Up Before You\nGo-Go\u2019, and \u2018Walking on Sunshine\u2019 appear on the soundtrack list, and\nthis marks singer Leona Lewis\u2019 film debut.\n\n"

You hope\nwhen there is nothing left to do,\nnothing you can do: you can\u2019t\nact, repair, work, correct or strive\nanymore, so you wish that things\ncould go your way. All you\u2019re left\nwith is your powerlessness and\nthe hope that cosmic coincidences\nwill align the world in your favour.\nWhen you hope, it means that you\nhave given up.\nThey say that hope is the last\nto die, and for good reason: it\noutlasts any other sentiment and\nfeeling. When you no longer\nhave the desire to seek a way to\nvictory, you can only hope that it\nwill be delivered to you by divine\nintervention. When you have\nexhausted every possible option\nand possibility, you can only hope\nthat a way out will be revealed.\nWhen all seems lost and forsaken,\nthe only resort is hope.\nIf you find yourself in such a\nsituation, then you can hope. If you\nare truly in despair, incapable and\nimpotent, and you have honestly\ndone everything in your power,\nthen you have the right to hope in\nforces beyond yourself. But to hope\nwhen there are still alternatives\nunexplored, when there is still\nsomething you can do, when the\nonly thing that is lacking is your\nwill to try, then hope becomes\na crime and a deceit. Hope will\nshow you a world that doesn\u2019t\nexist, where everything goes in the\nbest way possible and where your\ndeeds are justly rewarded, all of it\nwith a magic-like veneer. If you\ntrust in your hopes, if you come\nto believe in them as a future that\nhasn\u2019t happened yet, then you will\nneglect the work and effort that are\nnecessary to make them come true.\nIf you start hoping before you have\ndone all that you can and must do,\nyou will be led astray.\nSo do not hope. Do not hope that\nthe girl will say yes when you ask\nher out: know that you have done\neverything you can to make her\nwant to be with you. Do not hope\nthat the exam will be easy: know\nthat you have studied and prepared\nto the best of your abilities. And if\nyou have not studied, do not hope\nthings will go your way: accept and\nknow that they won\u2019t. Either way,\nthere is no need to false illusions\nand hope. Do not trust in the\neasy way offered by hope, but\ninstead know, research, think, act\nand work as much as you can to\nachieve your goals.\nDon\u2019t hope. Never hope.\nEditors: Tessa Davey, Eoghan J. Totten, Kunal Wagle\nPietro Aronica\nWriter\nThe Falsity Of\nIt\u2019s pretty\nterrifying to\nthink that\nthe next issue\nwill be edited by\nyours truly. Am I\nready? Right now?\nLiterally, right\nnow, as I sit in the\nsafety of Imperial\u2019s\ntiny humanities department, downing\ncaffeine after about four hours of sleep\nlast night? Nah, I\u2019m far from it.\nBut I have time, and hoping that in that\ntime I will learn a large number of things\nhopefully very quickly. These, you will be\nglad to know, will include learning how to\nwrite editorials that won\u2019t sound like the\nbeginning of an adolescent, self-absorbed\nMySpace profile \u201cabout me\u201d entry.\nIt was over two years ago now that I was\nhounding Tim to be a section editor for the\npaper. I had previously written a few articles,\nmy first being so atrocious I was surprised\nit was printed. I was pretty hopeless at\nInDesign at the beginning, had no idea how\nto write a science article and was completely\noverwhelmed by the Felix crowd of students\nthat all seemed more student-media savvy\nthan myself.\nHowever, I\u2019m glad I did take the time\nto go down to the office, see what the fuss\nwas all about and try and hack my way into\nthe Felix clique. We, the Felix team, love\npeople, and offer a great refuge to students\nwho simply want to hide away during Sport\u2019s\nnight if nothing else. We love writers, we\nlove photographers, we love editors and\ngrammar enthusiasts, and we love designers,\ncoders, and artists alike.\nNext year, the newspaper will be,\ncounterintuitively, less about the news and\nmore about the final form Felix hopes to take\nbefore my tenure comes to a close. We, of\ncourse, are aiming to deliver stories that will\nkick up a storm; we plan to put The Tab out\nof business and ensure no topic is too taboo\nto print. However we are also moving with\nthe times and planning a website overhaul,\na redesign of the paper and also a complete\nshift in the structure of the team itself.\nFelix is being rebuilt from scratch, and\nwe need people to help. If you want to be\npart of the new wave of student media, get\nin touch. If you want to meet new people,\nlearn new skills, get in touch. If you simply\nwant unlimited free tea and coffee, get in\ntouch but do give a bit of notice so we can\nget some top quality brew in.\nI hope you all have a good summer, and\nwill see you all again in Fresher\u2019s Week.\nI\u2019ll be the 22 year old sipping straight gin\nin the corner, muttering \u201cyouths\u201d under my\nbreath. Please come and say hi, or drop by\nthe office!\nWow, well it\ncertainly has\nbeen a year!\nI started this job in October, with a small\namount of training and the dusty cobwebs\nof my previous years of section editorship\nskulking miserably in the corners of my\nmind. Summer, as I\u2019m sure you all know, is\nquite potent at clearing the mind of useful\nmemories.\nI set out to redesign and expand the paper,\nand to some extent succeeded, I brought in\nnew sections and recruited new Editors and\nwriters, undergrads and postgrads alike.\nOver the course of the year the paper has\ntackled several important stories, including\nfollowing the issues surrounding the halls\ncleaning contracts, the Union\u2019s successful\nlobbying and many more that I can\u2019t\nremember (this week\u2019s has been a tiring\nissue).\nAlong with the printed words you see\nbefore you, this year\u2019s Felix, as every year,\ninvolves the sweat, occasionally tears (but\nhopefully no blood) of the students who\nvolunteered their time to edit the sections\nwe have and I can only be grateful for their\nhelp. Without them and without you the\npaper wouldn\u2019t happen.\nOver the last few years, and the last few\nEditors, we\u2019ve tried to make ourselves more\ntransparent and friendly to people who\naren\u2019t already involved \u2013 a task that has\nproven to be harder than one anticipates.\nHowever it is good to see that Philippa\nis also a keen proponent of change and\nimprovement, something that will bode well\nfor next year\u2019s paper.\nMost importantly \u2013 and it is sometime\nhard to convey this, Felix is always the your\npaper. We value your feedback (seriously\nplease do send in letters) and we try to give\nyou the content we think you\u2019d appreciate\nthe most.\nLooking back over my Felix career, I\nremember submitting my first article in first\nyear, proudly presenting it to my hall senior,\nwho at the time was a Technology editor.\nSince then, from moving on to editing\nPolitics during the reign of two Editors to\nfinally achieving my dream of editing the\nwhole paper, I\u2019m amazed at how much\nI\u2019ve learned along the way, as well as the\nfantastic people I\u2019ve met. It\u2019s not something\nI would have ever imagined doing when I\njoined Imperial, and yet I couldn\u2019t see my\nCollege journey ending any other way.\nWanting to go out with a bang, this week\nwe\u2019ve brought you Felix as a tabloid, it had\nto be done. After all we are a tabloid-sized\nnewspaper, definitely not a broadsheet. This\nhas been challenging in itself, however I\u2019ve\nrealised that I\u2019ve learned so much over the\nlast year \u2013 it look a day to redesign rather\nthan the significantly longer time it took at\nthe start of the year.\nThanks for reading and thanks for a great\nyear, I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed the paper!\nTalking to the Editors\nJOE PHILIPPA\n\n"

After a quick visit,\nphoto and mars bar deposit from Vicki\u2019s\nUncle and Aunt we headed for the ferry,\nand a midday nap. The five hour ferry\nbreak was well received, along with the mass\nproduced lunch box of copious egg mayo\nsandwiches, quavers and kitkats for all. This\nwas also when people found out their tour\njersey nicknames with some classic racial\nstereotyping naming the German Matthias\n\u201cHighly Efficient\u201d and his partner Olivia as\n\u201cLikes Highly Efficient Men\u201d.\nDay one was still not over, and once clear\nof the ferry we quickly stripped off for the\nnew warmer weather. With Billy \u201cBig Wille\u201d\nPalmer donning his new \u2018king of the hill\u2019\nboxer-shorts we began on the smoothest\nroads of our lives. Correct me if I\u2019ve got this\ncompletely wrong, but the French converted\nan old railway line into a clear cycle path all\nthe way from Dieppe to our B&B stop in\nForges les Eaux. It was built just before the\nLondon 2012 Olympics in a plan to allow\nthe French clear cycling to England. Love\nit! This was also where we found our new\nfervent love of trail mix; to the point where\nBilly was engulfing handfuls and Ellie \u201cStory\nTime Please\u201d Howard resorted to rationing\nit to make sure it would last.\nAs the sun came down over the French\nhorizon we arrived at our B&B, Hotel St.\nDenis. We had all wondered what the food\nwould be like when we got there but literally\njumped for joy at the \u201cSteak House\u201d lettering\non the restaurant\u2019s window. In short, we ate\nlike kings and queens to a three course steak\ndinner, followed by a rejuvenating shower,\nbeer and eventual sleep. But not before Pav\n\u201cGlup\u201d Dimitrijevi\u0107 announced that his\nurine was so dark and gloopy from all the\nsugar we\u2019d eaten it was like \u2018banoffee pie\nenergy gel\u2019\u2026 gross.\nSleep however was short lived, and an\n8:00am start the next day had us out and\npeddling once more. For 100m, until Marcel\n\u201cSouth African Stallion\u201d Admiraal noticed\nsomething wrong with his back wheel.\nEvery spoke was loose enough to be used\nas a guitar string. Dan \u201cSpare Tyre\u201d Tyrie\nand Ed \u201cSalty Face\u201d Hallett, our residential\nmechanics ummed erred and plunged\ninto the risky business of spoke tightening\nwithout the right equipment. Not something\nrecommended if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re\ndoing, but thankfully the wheel kept true\nand after some heavy creaking into place\nMarcel\u2019s bike was once again road worthy.\nThis was where we saw the true beauty of\nthe French countryside and the stunningly\nstraight and smooth roads. The undulating\nRoman roads towards Paris teased us into\nchallenges of speed and endurance, helping\nthe group develop much better Peloton\nriding skills. We were riding at a stunning\naverage pace well over 40km/h when we\npassed a particular yet unremarkable French\nfarmhouse. The peloton leaders who rode\npast heard a loud and throaty bark to the\nright and thought nothing of it, until screams\narose from behind. It is a sight never to be\nforgotten seeing a group of 13 other cyclists\nweaving all over the road to avoid a brutally\nlarge Rottweiler that had charged out barking\ninto the middle of the road, which narrowly\nmissed assaulting Pavle Dimitrijevi\u0107. Fran\nCapel close behind was however not so lucky\nand with MacAskill levels of skill managed\nto stay on her bike after being hit by the dog.\nThankfully by the time the dog had got up\neveryone was out of reach and it trotted back\nto its home. Excitement over.\nGarmin glitch #003 \u2013 The French Offroader. Having handled the British off-road\nwe felt headstrong and tackled the mud and\nrock path the Garmin had presented us, with\na challenge of a double rum shot for anyone\nwho got a puncture. During the entire\njourney\u2019s many challenges our handling\nskills were definitely refined and improved,\nand it was Billy Palmer who earned himself\nthat double shot. At the next rest stop we\nfolded a map out on the car front and tried\nour best to plan a better route, but the terrain\nkept changing none the less.\nGarmin glitch #004 \u2013 The Red Bridge.\nThis was actually not so bad, and took us\nover a gorgeous footbridge into a park full of\nBBQs and Sunday holiday makers, but was\nstill off-road and a few people were losing\npatience. All credit to Mattheas, he did a\nsterling job with what he had to work with!\nGarmin glitch #005 \u2013 The Dual\nCarriageway Flyover. Of all the glitches,\nthis one worried me the most because when\nyou\u2019re 100ft up on a fast traffic flyover with\njust a bike between your thighs and a little\nhelmet on your head there is an element of\n\u201cam I totally insane?\u201d Thankfully we made\nit to the end without any accidents, then\nwe looked back and a group had stopped\nhalfway. Panicking, because the only\nmechanics were now too far away to help,\nwe waited for Marcel to cycle over and give\nus a diagnosis. \u201cEllie has to go for a wee\u201d.\nAt that moment I gave Ellie a telepathic\nbitch-slap and began to fret even more.\nThankfully everyone got back ok, and the\ntrue story of sudden vomiting made Ellie\u2019s\nstop far more justified. But I was very glad\nto get off that road.\nThe final leg towards Tom\u2019s house had\nTom \u201cFit French Fresher\u201d Bartissol teach\nus all about why there were plastic bags\nhanging from sticks at the side of the road:\nit is a sign that there were prostitutes in the\nwoods waiting if you fancied a break. We\ndid keep a keen eye out for the support car\nback and Mike \u201cWinky Face\u201d Kaye parked\nup somewhere but it looks like he resisted\nthe urge.\nFinally, with throbbing thighs and wind-burnt faces we arrived at Tom\u2019s home to\na heroes\u2019 welcome. But the journey wasn\u2019t\nover. Donning the tour jerseys and refuelling\nwith cake, we mounted up once more to\ncycle to Paris and the Arc de Triomphe.\nOur entrance was less than traditional, and\nsaw us at the base of La Grande Arche de\nLa Defense. Our first view of the Arc de\nTriomphe brought cheers and we traversed\nthe adventure-park-style descent down steps\nand ramps weaving this way and that (feeling\na little too much like a biker gang) before\nbraving the French traffic. A final hill climb\nbrought us underneath our final destination.\nPowering into the swirling traffic we began\nour victory laps of the Arc de Triomphe\nand finally unsaddled from our bikes for the\nlast time. 288km down, and we had made\nit. Only to have the Gendarmes (aka Fun\nPolice) tell us we were too loud and must\nleave \u2018le monument historique\u2019, to which\nTom replied by accidentally popping a\nchampagne bottle at them. No harm done.\nNow to leave the whirling tornado of\nvehicular doom. Exagerating? Wait until\nyou try and cycle it. Fran survived yet\nanother collision this time from a French\ntaxi, Sian \u201cUnforgettable\u201d Morgan decided\nthe best approach was to exit radially with\none foot clipped in and Tom had to cycle it\nwith a bottle of champagne! Thankfully, no\none died.\nBack at Tom\u2019s and our cook, Fatima had\nprepared a gorgeous Moroccan feast for us\nwhich we engulfed before the tone lowered\nthanks to copious amounts of delicious\nFrench wine. The party continued into the\nearly morning hours with the fines circle\nopening for all to unleash their frustration\nthrough the medium of rum and white wine,\ninteresting French drinking games, thrusting\nplanks and teaching Mike that it\u2019s not ok\nto sleep when the fines circle was still in\noperation.\nDespite everything we still managed\na tourist\u2019s day of Paris, with some even\nrunning around Paris (see below). We truly\nproved ourselves in France.\nAs individuals we will always remember\ncycling to Paris and the challenges we faced,\nbut also as a team we pushed and encouraged\neach other through hard times; celebrated\nand laughed in great times; consolidated\nand supported through the tears and shared\nsweat in warm embraces at the end of a hard\nday. The first ever TriIC Easter Tour has\nbeen epic and I am in no doubt that in the\nfuture we will see more tours bring more\nbeautiful people together under the triathlon\nclub flag.\nBring on Summer Tour.\nICU TRIATHLON\nICU TRIATHLON\n\n"

In fact, whilst\nthe invigilators discussed their\ncourse of action, the students\nchatted about the exam paper\nand the answers (which they still\nhad at this point) with their peers\nfor approximately ten minutes.\nThe College\u2019s claim that students\nwould not have been able to use\n\u201cthe information to any advantage\u201d\nis therefore questionable.\nFurthermore, when the new\nquestion papers were provided,\nthe students were not forced to\nuse new answer booklets, meaning\nthat those who managed to copy\ndown answers or hints before the\nquestion paper was removed could\nhave gained an advantage.\nAnother dimension of the\nsituation involved the students\nwho had extra time to complete\nthe paper. Operating Systems\nwas part B of a two-part module\nthat also included Computer\nArchitecture. This was sat in the\nmorning and was then followed\nby a 30-minute break before Part\nB (the one with the mark scheme\npresent). However, as the extra\ntime students finished Part A,\nthe other students had returned\nfrom their break, meaning that\nthe students who were eligible to\nreceive extra time were present for\nthe mishap, and were able to listen\nto or take part in the discussion\nof the paper and answers before\ntaking their break, in which they\ncould potentially study the topics\nthey knew were on the exam.\nHaving looked at the relevant\ndocuments, it would appear that\nthe entire module, represented by\npapers A and B, is worth 7.5% of\nthe first year EIE course.\nWhen speaking to Felix about\nthe exam paper, another student\nsaid, \u201c[the department] wrongly\nthought we couldn\u2019t extrapolate\nthe answers from the mark scheme\nso it was probably wrong for the\nexam to go ahead\u201d.\nFelix feels that it is unfair to\nunduly criticise the staff for a simple\nmistake.\nHowever we believe that the\nstudents should be informed in\nmore detail about any repercussions,\nand that the overall situation could\nhave been handled significantly\nbetter when it first arose.\nAs a group of representatives\nof the Student\u2019s Unions and\nAssociations of the Russell Group,\nyou would expect them to be\ndoing, well something. With an\nempty website and empty promises\nof meeting at least 6 times a year,\nrumours have been spreading\namongst the twittersphere that the\ngroup may be disbanding.\nWhen approached to comment\non the situation, or really lack\nof situation, the Aldwych group\ndeclined to reply, which makes us\nwonder whether there\u2019s actually\nanyone at the other end of the\ncomputer.\nThe pristinely made website that\nhas pretty much no content apart\nfrom a long list of bullet points\nabout the Constitution along with\nno press releases, new updates\nor events, its no wonder that the\ngroup may be scrapped and sold\nfor parts.\nPerhaps the Aldwych group will\nstep up its game with the new\nprospect of Oxford joining the\nnon-NUS affiliates club or perhaps\nthey\u2019ll do what they are good at\ndoing, which is nothing.\nEither way, it\u2019s clear that this\ngroup either need to step up their\ngame or step out of the game.\nAemun Reza\nNews Editor\nWhat\u2019s happened to the Aldwych Group\nEditors: Nida Mahmud, Maciej Matuszewski, Aamna Mohdin, Aemun Reza, Kunal Wagle news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCollege Exam Scandal\nTriathlon\nwin \u201cBest\nKit\u201d Award\nSport Imperial ARCS Awards\nCoach of the Year \u2013 Tom Burwell\n(Medicals Rugby FC)\nSports Media Award \u2013 Varsity Live\nProduction Team\nEthos Award \u2013 Shannon Jewell\nSports Ambassador of the Year \u2013 Zain\nAbbas\nAthlete of the Year \u2013 Chris Bannon\nTeam of the Year \u2013 American Football\nClub of the Year \u2013 IT Tennis\n\n"

Contracts are not binding when they violate your statutory\nrights, so even if you sign a contract which does so by accident, these parts are void. However, employment contracts can offer you greater benefits than you are entitled to by law (e.g.\ngreater holiday entitlement), they just can\u2019t offer less.\nMinimum\nWage\nThe minimum wage for 18-20 year olds is \u00a35.03/hour.\nFor 21 year olds and over, it is \u00a36.31.\nContracts are not binding if they stipulate a rate of pay below the\nnational minimum wage \u2013 this is a rate you are entitled to and\nsupersedes contracts you may have signed with your employer.\nThe national minimum wage is the same for all workers,\nregardless of if they work full-time or part-time, the method\nof payment, and characteristics of the employer, such as the\nsize of the organisation you work for or whereabouts in the UK\nyou work.\nIf you feel you aren\u2019t being paid minimum wage, you can call the\nPay and Work Rights Helpline on 0800 917 2368. This is a free\nand confidential helpline run by the government.\nWho can work?\nIf you are from the UK or the European\nEconomic Area (EEA), you are free to work\nin the UK. International students staying in the UK\nover the summer and seeking employment will need to check\ntheir visa status to see whether or not this is prohibited and if\nthere are any restrictions placed upon your employment.\nIf in doubt, you can contact Imperial\u2019s International\nOffice for more advice.\nHoliday\npay\nIf you were working full-time, you would have the\nright to 5.6 weeks of paid\nholiday a year in most professions.\nFor part-time workers, you are entitled to\nthe same annual leave as full-time workers\nbut this is calculated based on the number\nof days you actually work. For example, if you\nwork 2 days a week, the leave is calculated as\n2x5.6 (leave entitlement), which equals 11.2\ndays of paid annual leave.\nHow\nlong can I work?\nMost workers have a right to not work over\n48 hours a week and workers over 18 are\nentitled to at least one day off a week. If you\nare working for longer than 6 hours, you have\nto be given at least a 20 minute rest break and\nyou are also entitled to 11 hours off each day\nfrom your job.\nZero-hours\ncontract\nA zero-hours contract is essentially a contract where\nan employer has no obligation to offer you shifts\nand you have no obligation to accept shifts. This\ncreates a different working relationship\nthan other forms of contract however, if\nyou\u2019re on a zero-hours contract you\nare still entitled to annual\nleave and the national\nminimum wage.\nCashin-Hand\nwork\nRegardless of whether or not your\nwork full-time, your employer has\nto deduct tax and National Insurance\ncontributions from your pay by law. If your\nemployer pays you cash-in-hand without these\ndeductions, you might lose employment rights\nand some benefits such as sick pay. You also\nrun the risk of having to pay these fees\nyourself.\nHealth\nand safety\nThere are a whole load of health and\nsafety rules an employer must follow\nin order to ensure their employees\nare working in a safe environment. These\nrange from first aid facilities, to fire safety\nto noise issues. As an employee, it is your\nright to work in a safe environment and to\nbe provided with equipment to ensure your\nsafety as appropriate e.g. ear plugs or\nprotective clothing.\nIssues\nwith\nemployers\nIf you are concerned that your contract\ndoesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, the first option is often to\ntalk to your line manager at work about your concerns or\nthe company\u2019s HR department (should they have one). If\nyou would like help or support with this, you can contact\nthe Union\u2019s Advice Centre who can give advice\nabout employment rights.\nIf this route doesn\u2019t get the required\nresult, you can also approach the Citizen\u2019s\nAdvice Bureau who can offer further\nsupport and even take your case\nto an employment tribunal if the\nissue isn\u2019t resolved.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 20 JUN\n46 SPORT\nPELOTON\nTO\nPARIS\nContinued from Back Page\nWith great trepidation and supposition\nthe brave fifteen prepared for a two day\ncycle to Paris; an Arch to Arc ride through\nSouthern English countryside to promised\ncelestial heights of French tarmac. In\npensive preparation for the challenge ahead\nmany members settled into a relaxing night\nof partying in central London, while others\nrelaxed to an evening of car hunting and bag\nloading until the early hours of the night.\nAnd after a restful two hours of sleep it was\ntime to depart for Marble Arch.\nIn great style everyone arrived precisely for\nthe 4:00am meet; a semblance for times to\ncome. The chilled darkness of Marble Arch\nendorsed a frosty air of great expectation.\nMichael Kaye, our support driver and joint\ntour organiser with Vicki Solly captured the\nmoment at Marble Arch before firing the\nmetaphorical starting pistol for our 288km\njourney.\n100m round the corner and we had our\nfirst stop. Fran\u2019s saddle had gone floppy and\nthe trusty Garmin route plan was corrupted.\nIt had decided we would fly there in a dead\nstraight line. Our team guide Matthias Knop\nswiftly employed some crossed fingers and\nleprechaun luck to set us moving once\nagain. This was however not the end of our\nGarmin glitches.\nLondon proved slow but clear road\ncycling, and before we knew it we were\nreunited with the support car. A Nature\nValley in the stomach and a cereal bar in\nthe back pocket and pedals turned\nonce again. Cycling in a group\nof fourteen has two major\nissues: English roads\nare never straight, so\ncars have very limited\ntime and space to\novertake, leaving\nsome overtakes\ndangerously close to\nhandlebars; the other\nis a caterpillar effect\nwhen the Peloton\nfront changes pace.\nA slight touch on the\nbrakes by the Peloton\nleader and the back of\nthe pack is emergency\nbraking to avoid a collision.\nBy the two hundredth kilometre\nwe had filtered the effects down and\nwere substantially smoother, but there were\nmany alarmed squeals escaping the peloton\nbefore that.\nThe second rest stop taught us all a lesson\non how to relieve oneself in public while\nwearing cycling gear. First one must waddle\naround in cycling cleats to find a suitable\nbin/bush/tree to hide behind.\nThen it is a complicated\nlabyrinth of lycra to\nnegotiate with a reenactment of the\n\u201cwalk-off pants\nr e m o v a l \u201d\nscene from\nZoolander\nfor the\nboys and\na far more\ncomplicated\nachievement\nby the girls.\nHowever as\nalways, we\npower through\nwhatever obstacle\nin the name of our\ncause. The final 40km\nwas ahead, and time was\nrapidly disappearing to get to the\nferry at Newhaven.\nTime for Garmin glitch #002. Youthfully\noptimistic we turned on to a dead-end road\nand persuaded each other that the Garmin\nmust be correct, before reaching a dirt track\nto a chorus of \u201cI told you this was a deadend\u201d and \u201cthis is going to be bad for my\nbike!\u201d Nevertheless, any obstacle and the\nnext kilometre was completed at a nerve\nshatteringly slow pace. Laughing it off back\non tarmac we proceeded into yet another,\neven muddier bridle path that was clearly\nnot correct. Muddy cleats and slipping\nwheels, bikes on shoulders and mud filled\nbrakes, we introduced our road bikes to the\njoys of mountain biking; amazingly, without\na puncture.\nFinally, the hills of Newhaven presented\nthemselves to us, along with the first\npuncture. A relaxed and hard earned descent\nturned quickly into wheel locking panic as\nTom Bartissol (our French host) suddenly\nstopped halfway down in front of a pothole\nwith a puncture. In our special supportive\nway we all hurled abuse at him as we passed\nwondering why he had stopped. Then\ncollectively agreed he had completely over\nreacted and must have stop to announce \u201cle\ntres dangeroux pothole\u201d. The error was soon\nICU TRIATHLON\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 20 JUN\n40 FOOD\nHello - I\u2019m Serverella, your\naverage neighborhood waiter.\nJust like Cinderella, I\u2019ve been\n\u201cforced\u201d into drudgery to\nget by; except outside of\nthe Grimm era, I work at the\ncoalface of the service and\nhospitality industry to survive\nin pricey London, and said\ndrudgery is by choice.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; unlike\nCinders, my job is more than\nmenial labour - I actually get to\nbat my lashes at a variety of folk\nin semi-decent uniform, and I\u2019m\ncertainly not covered in soot/\ncinders by the end of my shift.\nIt\u2019s just as grueling though; I can\nbe on my feet for up to 10 hours\nper shift. I enjoy it in some weird\nway, though sometimes I wish\ncustomers would make it better for\nus - it\u2019s actually not that difficult.\nSo here are some of my musings\non what goes on behind the\nscenes, and some tips on how you\ncan make the most out of your\nhospitality-industry experience\n(whether it\u2019s a birthday party,\ncasual first date, classy business\nschmoozing or your bajillionth\nanniversary) - this way, you can\nhelp us help you.\nGETTING ONE FOOT IN\nWe\u2019re well aware some places are\nso bloody popular that reservations\nare damn well expected/a must\n(looking at you, Sushi Tetsu), and\nothers (hello MEATLiquor!) just\ndon\u2019t do reservations - so you have\nto try your luck right when it opens\nand hope to high heaven you get\nin. And some establishments are\nthe poncey type where even if they\ndon\u2019t say so, they\u2019ll be snooty to\nwalk-ins.\nBut what about those you\u2019re not\nsure about popularity-wise (read:\nmost places)? As a starting point,\nif you know you\u2019re after a weekend\nprimetime lunch/dinner slot,\ndon\u2019t be a self-centered yuppie -PLEASE RESERVE EARLY (if\nthey take them.) If you\u2019re coming\nin on a chilled day (Mondays and\nTuesdays tend to be dead-days for\nrestaurants - it\u2019s why you get most\ndeals happening on those days) or\na bit of an off-peak time, you could\njust walk in and ask the host(ess)\nnicely. It goes without saying that\nyour chances increase loads if\nyou\u2019re there right when it opens -compared to when the night is in\nfull swing.\nOn the subject of OpenTable for\nreservations\u2026establishments would\nmuch rather you call to reserve - it\ncosts us a fee per diner (nevermind\nthe crazy start-up and monthly\nsubscription costs), whereas\nphoning/emailing us directly\nbypasses that. Think of the site as\nthe Ticketmaster of the restaurant\nworld - albeit quite hated by peeps\nin the industry. Those \u201cOT-only\u201d\ndeals you got on their site? Some\nof them are actually a sneaky way\nfor restaurants to pass on the\nper-diner cost. Others make up\nfor it by hiking prices up post-installing OpenTable. Emailing is\nfree, and allows us to keep more\nof our profits (don\u2019t be surprised\nif some restaurants act a little bit\ncolder towards OTers...I\u2019ve seen it\nhappen.)\nBig group? For the love of\nMichelin, wherever you go, don\u2019t\njust show up - please phone or\nemail way ahead of time. There\nwill most likely be a minimum\nspend of some sort (to discourage\nstingy campers who\u2019ll spend nawt),\nbut sometimes if your group has\nbeen amazing your server might\nthrow in a nice surprise...more on\nfreebies and attitudes later though.\nNO-SHOW ETIQUETTE\nWe get it, life\u2019s a b***h and\nsometimes things just get in the\nway. Or other times you\u2019re still\nundecided between two places for\nthat special surprise and figured\nyou\u2019d book two to be safe and stand\nup on one when you\u2019ve decided.\nEither way, we know minds and\nplans change; just please PLEASE\nphone or email us to let us know\nyou won\u2019t be coming, whether it\u2019s a\nbusy day or not. Sometimes we get\nunexpectedly slammed with walk-ins, so you taking the trouble to tell\nus in advance helps us make sure\nwe can make another unexpected\ncustomer happy.\nSame goes for if you\u2019re running\nlate - most places will hold your\ntable for up to 30 mins without\nyou giving notice, but it\u2019s much\nbetter for us all if you say ahead of\ntime how far away you\u2019ll be. Your\ntable isn\u2019t the only one in your\nserver\u2019s section, and any notice\nyou can give us helps us organize\nourselves a bit better. Scratch our\nback and we\u2019ll scratch yours by\ntrying to make sure you won\u2019t have\nto rush through your main course\nin 10 minutes because we need to\nturn tables for the next seating.\nBe sensible, though. Restaurants\nactually keep track of repeat no-shows and cancellations - if you\u2019re\nthe kind to stand us up 13 times\nout of 15 reservations, eventually\nwe won\u2019t even bother accepting\nyour booking.\nFREEBIES\nOh we can tell who you are all\nright - those of you who want\nsomething for nothing. Your\nservers are canny like that (even\nthe bartenders you were trying to\nsweet-talk for \u201cbirthday shots\u201d),\nbut we can tell you that if you\ndon\u2019t expect it and are all-around\npleasant, and it\u2019s genuinely a social\noccasion or you\u2019re a good regular,\nmore often than not we\u2019ll *maybe*\ngive you a free something. One\nthing\u2019s for sure, though: name-dropping the owners is NOT the\nway to go. You know the owners\npersonally? Great, so do we! Half\nthe time we probably despise them\n- nice try, bub.\nSometimes when you get a\nfreebie, you don\u2019t have to feel too\nbad about it - we\u2019ve usually got a\nlittle \u201cfreebie tab budget\u201d/stock we\nreserve for complimentary goodies\non that night, so we can afford it.\nOther times though we\u2019ve got to\ntwist our managers\u2019 arms before we\ncan comp your drink - so be nice!\nAt a bar? A decent tip (beyond\nyour usual 1-2 quid) goes a long\nway in getting your bartender to\nsweeten up. They\u2019ll be even more\ninclined to remember your name\nand drink choices before you open\nyour mouth (even if they\u2019re usually\nvery good like that, tip or not.)\nSOME WAYS TO PISS US OFF\nOnce you\u2019re shown to your table,\nfor heaven\u2019s sake, sit where you are\nseated. Nothing personal - there\nreally are so many good tables,\nand unless you\u2019ve put in a special\nrequest/are a good regular your\nchances of getting a good table\nmay be slim. Don\u2019t be an asshole\nby requesting a bigger 4-pax table\nwhen there are just two of you -if the place fills up, I sure as hell\nrefuse to turn people away just\nbecause your Gucci/LV is warming\nthe two spare chairs. Can we say\nmismanagement of resources?\nJust as douchey would be asking\nto move tables because you feel\nshafted. For Roux\u2019s sake, planning\nseating arrangements requires just\nas much meticulousness as Gulf\nware plans.\nI cry at the number of people\nwho are more interested in their\ncellphones than engaging with\ntheir dates/mates and paying full\nattention when ordering from\ntheir servers. Unless you\u2019re a doc\non standby waiting for an organ to\narrive, turn the darn thing off (and\nif you are, wouldn\u2019t you be eating\nin the hospital cafeteria anyway?)\nThere are plenty more ways you\ncan rock - or suck - when you\u2019re\ndining out, though sadly they won\u2019t\nall fit on this page. Interested in\nhearing more tales from my end?\nGot questions on how to dining-out norms? Want to share your\nhorror/ace stories in hospitality?\nEmail Mike and Caz at food.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk - look\nforward to reading your letters.\nThanks for supporting us @ Food over the year - it\u2019s been fun!\nHOW NOT TO SUCK AT EATING/DRINKING OUT\nServerella\nHospitality Lackey\nSERVERELLA dishes it like it is...\nand spills\na few\nindustry\nsecrets\nEditors: Carol Ann Cheah, Michael Yat Kit Chung food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "37\nFRIDAY 20 JUN CLUBS & SOCS\nEndless twisting roads.\nI kept running, ever\nconscious of the footsteps\nbehind me, its march\nkeeping to the drumbeat of\nmy heart.\nI took a left, almost falling\nfrom skidding on the\ntorrential downpour.\nTap.\nTap.\nTap.\nAfter my recent submission\nto a collection curated by messrs\nMcIntosh and Bergen, I took my\nleave for Bruges. I had heard much\nof the Belgian air\u2019s restorative effects,\nand I was tired from my studies,\nand so I found myself but 3 days\nago leaving the comfortable bosom\nof London for the continent. The\njourney was largely uneventful,\nalthough I found myself attempting\nto leave the train at Aalter, as if in\na trance, unthinkingly taking my\nluggage and walking to the door. I\ncame to as I had nearly stepped out,\nand returned to my seat. I now wish\nI had not, and allowed whatever\nprovidence to succeed in its attempt\nto save me.\nUpon reaching Bruges, I\nattempted to find my lodging, a\nsmall boarding house near one of\nthe city gates. I had procured a map\nwhile in London, but none of the\nstreets seemed to quite match, and\nwere named differently when they\ndid. I walked at least one circle of the\nmaze, the trudging of my feet like a\nshambling chant, walking out some\nkind of prayer to be shown rest. But\nas that thought crossed my mind,\nthe architecture yielded, and it was\nbefore me, where surely it was not\nbefore.\nI checked into the hotel, and\nwent for a simple dinner in the\nsmall square a short walk away. The\nmussels were delicious, the escargot\ndivine, the beer rich and dark.The\nstreets, previously desolate and\nforeboding, were now filled with\nall kinds of people, bustling and\nscurrying to avoid the rain, suddenly\npouring from the sky as it was. I idly\nwatched them to and fro, before the\nsky darkened, the rain stopped, and\nthey disappeared. I paid and left,\nand found myself stood on a bridge\nlooking out over one of the many\ncanals, and shuddered. The river,\nits black mass seething and writhing\nbeneath, gurgling as if digesting\nits last\nvictim, hungry. Even though it\nhas no eyes, I knew it watched me\npass. It watched, and I shuddered,\nwith something even more primal\nthan fear, something that left me\ntransfixed, held as if by the hand\nof God Himself, if such a thing can\neven exist in the face of this... thing\nbelow. By the time I returned to\nmy body and came to my senses,\nthe shadow in the water was gone.\nI stumbled back to my lodgings,\nshaken.\nThe day that followed was\nagreeable, visiting local collections\nand enjoying delicacies. The rain left\nme soaked as I walked, and I often\nfound myself at a loss attempting to\ncomprehend the geometry of the\nplace, but suddenly it was refreshing,\nalmost comforting in a way I can\u2019t\nquite describe but felt so assuredly.\nThere was one moment of unease,\nhowever.Withinacollectiondevoted\nto showcasing local produce, I came\nupon a scene of such macabre\nintentions I can barely comprehend.\nA vision of a man consuming\nhis own flesh, as if overcome by\nmadness, not for want of food, but\nof such warped senses as to find it\nappetizing. Next to them, a woman\noffered up her child, like a basket of\ndelicious fruits, insane and twisted.\nConfused and\nunsettled, I moved on into the safety\nof the rain. I woke the following\nmorning, packed my things, said\nmy goodbyes, and started toward\nthe station. I inevitably found myself\nlost, the maddening layout mocking\nme as I walked in circles again. I\ncould not even try to ask a local for\nguidance, as the streets were once\nmore empty. After an hour of this,\nthe sun beating down on me, I tried\nto stop for a lunch, or perhaps one\nof the Trappist brews, but found nowhere open. A bell tolled in the near\ndistance, hidden behind the walls of\nthis maze, so close and yet obscured\nand concealed. I turned, looked at\nmy map, turned again.\nEverywhere, a winding\nroad of esoteric yet uniform\narchitecture, devoid of any\nkind of life. \u201cGieterijstraat\u201d,\n\u201c W i t t e l e e r t o u w e s s t r a a t \u201d ,\n\u201cMinderbroederstraat\u201d, the language\nas arcane as the streets themselves,\nseemingly assembled without form\nor reason. It was at this point that I\nknew. The city had caught me, and\nnow it was simply playing.\nI walked and walked, growing tired\nand hungry. I longed for the rain, to\ncoolmeinthesunandasreassurance\nthat time was truly passing. But with\nit came the footsteps. When I first\nheard them, I felt joy, but it soon\nturned to terror as I saw what was\nmaking them, for I had seen it in the\neyes of the man feasting on himself.\nI turned and ran. The footsteps\nfollowed, with a slow yet constant\npacing, never matching my speed\nbut always growing closer. I ran and\nit followed, waiting for me to tire and\nfall.\nThe rain lifted, and with it went\nthe footsteps. I was safe, of a kind,\nbut just as trapped as before. I rested\nfor a few moments, before stumbling\nforward in hope of finding a gate\nbefore the rain returned, my body\naching.\nBut it rained again. And again,\nand again, through day and night. I\ndo not know how many frozen cold\nwet nights I ran for. It never quite\nreached me, but it was often close,\nits scent lingering, mixing with my\nown newfound smell of decay. Even\nthough I knew there was no exit\nfrom this foul place, I kept running,\nhope alone keeping me mobile.\nDays turned to weeks, and I\ncollapsed, exhausted and starving,\nnot even having the strength to fear\nanymore. I willed it to catch me, to\nconsume me through myself.\nWhen the rain came that time, I\ndid not hear the footsteps.\nI am told I spent only 3 days\nabroad, although they will admit\nI looked somehow aged. I escaped\nwith my life, but I am less sure of my\nsoul, and know I have lost my mind.\nMy nurse chatters to herself as she\ntidies my bedsheets and nightstand.\nI pick at my skin and start to salivate.\nThe\nNatives\nof Bruges\nEthel Bardsley\n\n"

    "content": "31\nFRIDAY 20 JUN FILM & TV\nIf/when a murder happens,\nthe excuse of \u201cthe mirror made\nme do it\u201d is not likely to be an\nacceptable form of defence for\nthe perpetrator. However for\nthe characters tangled up in\nthe violent nightmare of film\nOculus, it really is the case that\nthe antique family mirror drove\neveryone ultimately crazy.\n21-year-old Tim Russell\n(Brenton Thwaites) is awaiting\nfor discharge from a psychiatric\nhospital, where he stayed ever\nsince a horrific incident that\noccurred eleven years ago. He\nremembers snapshots of what\nhappened, with the gruesome\nflashback ending with him,\nas a ten-year-old boy (Garrett\nRyan) shooting his father.\nReuniting with his older sister\nKaylie (Karen Gillan) in the\noutside world, Tim wishes to\nstart a brand new chapter in his\nlife, away from the horrors that\ntook place in their household\nall those years ago. But Kaylie\nwants Tim to remember and to\nexact revenge on the dark entity\nthat put them in this difficult\nsituation in the first place. But\nremember what exactly? And it\u2019s\nfrom this point on the film starts\nto effectively juggle two narrative\nstrands. One in the present,\nand the other focusing on what\nhappened eleven years ago.\nThe Russell family, led by\nfather Alan (Rory Cochrane)\nand mother Marie (Katee\nSackhoff), move into their\nnew home, which is where the\ndeadly mirror in question first\nmakes its appearance. It\u2019s a part\nof Alan decorating his office,\nalthough little does he know how\nmuch of a twisted, sinister turn\nhis domestic life will take as a\nconsequence of having that ugly\nrelic around the house.\nAt first they are small, minor\nchanges, then they develop into\ndisturbing visions, stomach-turning violence, leading up\nto downright insanity. Marie\nand the children are thrown\ninto this also, building up to\na crashing climax that leads to\nTim becoming institutionalised\nat a young age.\nIn the present, Kaylie\nremembers all about what went\non during the dark periods of\nher childhood. She tracks down\nthe haunted mirror, does her\nresearch, and is ready to test and\ndestroy it once and for all. Her\nfamily name was clearly hit hard\nby bad press surrounding the\nnews coverage of that infamous\nnight, and now she\u2019s willing to\nprove everyone\u2019s innocence, her\nfather\u2019s as well as her brother\u2019s.\nThe cameras are set up to\nrecord everything, and she has\nalso dragged along her reluctant\nbrother to take part in what looks\nlike a risky experiment.\nNow this mirror is a piece of\nwork. It has defence mechanisms\nof its own, and has the knack\nof playing some serious mind\ngames with the poor fools who\ntry to tackle this problem head\non. It plays with the characters\u2019\nminds, placing them in wildly\nconfusing and equally dangerous\nsituations. And even with a single\nmisstep, Kaylie\u2019s plan will fall\nspectacularly apart. As the focus\nof the horror film starts toying\nwith the protagonists, the equal\neffect is had on its audience, in\nits gripping, spooky atmosphere\nthat has an advantage of not\nbeing utterly predictable from\nstart to finish.\nThe performances are\nuniformly excellent, the best\nwork coming from Scottish\nactress Karen Gillan, handling\nher meaty role with confidence,\nwith the added bonus of putting\non an impeccable American\naccent. Cult favourites Cochrane\nand Sackhoff have more to do\nthan the audience is initially lead\nto believe, and they both pull off\nterror beautifully.\nVery few horror films have\nsatisfying endings, and Oculus is\nno exception when it comes to\nthis department of becoming the\nflimsiest part of the movie, having\nhad such incredible scenes of\nterrifying and effective build-up.\nBut the film opens itself up for\npossible sequels, and with the\nendless horror opportunities that\nthe deadly mirror provides, bring\non part two and whoever wants\nto square off against it.\nJustice League assemble\nThe rumour mill is exploding with numerous casting announcements\nas well as wild speculations surrounding Zack Snyder\u2019s Man of Steel\nsequel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Here is what little\nwe know so far...\nBrit actor Henry Cavill will be\nback: reprising his role as Clark\nKent/Superman. Hurrah.\nWhether you like it or not, Ben\nAffleck WILL be playing Bruce\nWayne/Batman.\nRelative unknown Gal Cadot is set\nto play Wonder Woman, adding\na much-needed female superhero.\nJason Momoa (aka the guy who\nrapes Daenerys in Game of\nThrones) will play Aquaman.\nFast-talking Oscar nominated actor\nJesse Eisenberg is confirmed for\nLex Luthor, Superman\u2019s nemesis.\nBruce Wayne\u2019s loyal butler, a role\nonce filled by Michael Caine, goes\nto the equally great Jeremy Irons.\nAmy Adams is signed on to return\nas Superman\u2019s girlfriend, award-winning journalist Lois Lane.\nThe only parenting figure of\nSuperman who hasn\u2019t died, Diane\nLane will guide Clark as Martha.\nLaurence Fisburne will be Clark\u2019s\nnew boss, as the editor-in-chief of\nDaily Planet, Perry White.\nPlease let this be true. Loki as the\nnew Joker? Yes please. He\u2019ll be\nabsolutely incredible.\nNo Justice League movie can be\nwithout Catwoman. Emily Blunt is\nreportedly circling the role.\nIn honour of Ben Affleck playing\nBatman, there have been stories\nMatt Damon could be Robin.\nStephen Amell, playing CW\u2019s\nGreen Arrow (ie DC\u2019s version of\nHawkeye), is up for joining.\nYeah, nice try Ryan Reynolds, The\nGreen Lantern will not be a part of\nthis. Not for a while anyway.\nHe may have dropped out of 50\nShades of Grey, but could Charlie\nHunnam be The Flash?\nMirror mirror\non the wall...\n\n"

Recent articles in the\ngame section garnered a lot of views,\nand there were several calls for the\ncurrent games editor to be instated\nas news editor. In fact, the current\nEditor-in-Chief remarked: \u201cI really\nlike gaming, gaming is fun.\u201d, which\nseems to suggest he supports the\nidea of a change at the helm of the\nfront page of Imperial\u2019s newspaper.\nThere seems to also be suggestions\nof a redesign of the felix logo as seen\non the right, with a public poll to\ntake place to choose the right one.\nFelix Comment\nThe discussion for this article is\nwhether the comment section\nwould be better with a heavier\nfocus on gaming. While currently\nthe comment section is quite\nboring, discussing inane topics\nlike philosophy and communism,\na larger influence from the\ninteresting area of gaming would\ncertainly increase readership in this\nold-fashioned section. In fact, the\ncurrent Editor-in-Chief remarked:\n\u201cI really like gaming, gaming is\nfun.\u201d, once again suggesting a shake\nup in the current set up of the\ncomment section. I myself would\nbe quite satisfied if this happened,\nand would certainly contribute.\nFelix Science\nA recent scientific paper published\nin the prestigious journal Gamure\nthat suggests that the science section\nis boring, and would be much\nbetter if gaming was given a more\nprominent position. This could\ninclude the science of how shooting\nbarrels and/or respawns. This last\nissue in particular has wide-ranging\nconsequences and could result in\nimmortality. In fact, the current\nEditor-in-Chief remarked: \u201cI\nreally like gaming, gaming is fun.\u201d,\nsuggesting he as well is inclined\nto introduce a gaming focus into\nscience, thus making this section\nmore relevant for the Imperial\ncollege of Science an Technology.\nFelix Arts\nHaving recently visited the gaming\nexhibition at earls court, including\nmodern artists like EA van Gogh\nand Leonardo Di Activision, has\nreally opened my eyes to gaming\nas an art form. The pieces like\nCall of Duty were insightful and\nreally commented on our current\nsocial and economical situation. I,\ntherefore, call for the Felix Editor\nwho recently said, \u201cI really like\ngaming, gaming is fun.\u201d to shake\nup the dusty art section and actual\nget people reading it. This change\ncould include instating the games\neditor as arts editor, as well as\nfeaturing interesting art (gaming)\nreviews.\nFelix Music\nThe latest album GTA V by\ngenre-spanning rockstars Rockstar\nstudios has been an absolute\nsuccess. The music throughout\nthe entirety of this work really\nis entertaining and spans the\nentire spectrum of emotion. It\nallows you to let your anger free\nand really roam the wide world\nit creates. Now read again, you\nread a gaming review. Admit it,\nyou loved it. Therefore I suggest\nthat we model music more on the\ngaming section, with a heavier\nfocus on gaming. This idea is also\nsupported by the current editor-in-chief who said: \u201cI really like\ngaming, gaming is fun.\u201d\nFelix Film\nThis lengthy section, almost like\nthe films it review, would certainly\nbenefit from a snappier first person\ngaming approach. Controlling the\ncharacters would convey emotion\nand thus giving this section a\nmuch needed readership boost. In\naddition the Felix editor himself\nsaid: \u201cI really like gaming, gaming\nis fun.\u201d\nFelix Tech\nThe tech section is the worst\nsection of them all. Maximilian\nEggl, current technology section\neditor said: \u201cIt\u2019s completely\nshit, we only review apple stuff\nanyway.\u201d Us from the gaming\nsection have no clear solution\nfor this lack of quality due to\nthe fact that even doing more\ngaming related material would\nnot increase the quality of this\nsection. What we do suggest\nis scrapping the tech section\ncompletely and introducing\na section namely gaming-technology, with Maximilian\nEggl, current gaming section\neditor, as its chief.\nFelix Food\nSandwich \u00e0 la Gaming:\n2 x pieces of bread\n1 x piece of ham\n2 x salad leaves\n3 x tomatoes\nMayonaise\nFirstly toast the bread until it is\ncrunchy, and then slowly add the\nmayonaise to each side. Next very\ncarefully cut the tomatoes into halves\nand arrange them symmetrically\non one of the pieces of toast. Then\nforcefully throw the salad on the\ntoast, and finish off with slapping\nthe ham on, and then smacking the\ntwo pieces together. Voil\u00e0 you know\nhave perfect gaming snack food\nGaming would be\nbetter\nFilm Editor: John Park\nGames Editor: Maximilian Eggl,\nCalum skene\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 20 JUN\n14 SCIENCE\nNew research has shown that\nmen watching more violence on\ntelevision could result in stunted\nin brain development, and the\ninability to control impulsive\nbehaviours, including aggression.\nAstudy,ranbyatopbrainjournal,\nused brain imaging techniques to\nmeasure the mental abilities and\nvolumes of key brain regions for a\ngroup of men, specifically chosen\ndue to the fact that they don\u2019t play\nvideo games but still watch TV.\nThe young men kept a diary of\nwhat they watched on the TV for\na week, and completed further\npsychological tests to measure\nmemory, attention and inhibitory\ncontrol.\nIt was found that the more violent\nTV viewing the men indulged in,\nthe more likely they were to be\nless attentive, and were less able to\ncontrol their cognitive function.\nNot only that, but there appeared\nto be an actual structural difference\nin the brains of those that enjoyed\nthe violent content of television\nshows.\nLead author Tom A. Hummer,\nPh.D., assistant research professor\nintheIUDepartmentofPsychiatry,\nsaid of the study: \u201cWhen we\nlooked at the brain scans of young\nmen with higher violent television\nexposure, there was less volume of\nwhite matter connecting the frontal\nand parietal lobes, which can be\na sign of less maturity in brain\ndevelopment.\u201d\nWhite matter of the brain\ninsulates and protects nerve fibres,\nthey allow different parts of the\nbrain to connect and interact with\neach other. Usually, this white\nmatter volume increases as the\nbrain makes more connections\nthroughout development, up\nuntil the age of around 30. These\nconnections are important for\nexecutive functioning of the\nbrain, which includes formulating\nplans, make decisions, reason and\nproblem solve.\n\u201cThe take-home message\nfrom this study is the finding\nof a relationship between how\nmuch violent television we\nwatch and important aspects of\nbrain functioning like controlled\nattention and inhibition,\u201d Dr.\nHummer said.\nPeople who spend more time\nsitting are more at risk of getting\ncancer than people who don\u2019t, a\nnew study reveals.\nWe already knew that sitting\nis linked to diabetes and heart\ndisease, but our sedentary\nlifestyles are now even more\ndangerous than we thought.\nScientists looked at thousands\nof cancer studies and found that\nthe risk for three specific cancers,\nbowel, endometrial (womb lining)\nand lung, is much greater when\nyou sit down, like you do in the\noffice or when watching TV.\nIn the studies, the least amount\nof time spent sitting was two\nto three hours. Every two-hour\nincrease in sitting time from this\nwas linked to an eight percent\nincreased risk of bowel cancer\nand a ten percent increased risk\nof endometrial cancer.\nAt least sitting doesn\u2019t increase\nthe risks for other cancers.\nBut even if you work out\nregularly, you can\u2019t get rid of\nthe increased risk of bowel,\nendometrial and lung cancer.\nOnly spending less time on your\nbottom will help prevent them.\nTHIS research was carried out as\na \u2018meta analysis\u2019, as it took data\nfrom previous studies to draw new\nconclusions. Pooled data was taken\nfrom 43 studies with more than four\nmillion participants, and covered\nmore than 70,000 cancer cases.\n\u201cCutting down on TV viewing\nand sedentary time is just as\nimportant as becoming more\nactive,\u201d said Daniela Schmid, one\nof the authors of the study. \u201cFor\nthose whose jobs require them to\nsit at a desk most of the day, we\nrecommend breaking up the time\nspent sitting by incorporating\nshort bouts of light activity into\nthe daily routine,\u201d she added.\nSo next time you switch on your\nscreens to watch the World Cup,\ndon\u2019t take a seat \u2013 take a stand.\nDoessittingdownonsofasgiveyoucancer?\nEXCLUSIVE: VIOLENCE MAY LEAD TO MORE VIOLENCE\nFiona Hartley\nScience Editor\nPhilippa Skett\nScience Editor\nDoes watching violence on\nTV make\nmen\nmore\nviolent?\n\n"

After global warming freezes\nEarth to death, lucky survivors\non a miracle train that repeatedly\ntravels round and round the globe,\nare stuck in this perpetual cycle\nand the harsh class division the\ntrain enforces on its passengers.\nThe rich enjoy all the luxuries\nnear the front of the train, where\nthe poor are forced to survive\namongst themselves in horrendous\nconditions.\nBut it\u2019s time for the passengers of\nthe back to rise up. United under\nthe reluctant leader in the form of\nCurtis (Chris Evans), they plan a\nday of uprising to overthrow the\nunfair, violent rule of the rich\nthat is imposed on them. The aim\nis to get to the very front of the\ntrain, take control of the engine\nroom, and come face-to-face with\nWilford (Ed Harris), the man\nwho built this train. Whilst the\ntrain serves as a vessel of survival\naway from the freezing cold of\nthe outside world, the conditions\ninside as it is soon revealed to us,\nare not all that much better.\nThere are striking, unsettling\nsimilarities with what goes on\ninside this train with what is\nhappening right now in our\nworld. The extreme wealth gap,\nviolence against the weak, greed\nfor resources, the list goes on and\non. The struggle experienced at the\nback of the train is very extremely\nportrayed, with no sugar-coating\nof any kind, whereas the lavish\ndisplay of what goes on near the\nfront is quite the uncomfortable\nspectacle. Curtis and his gang are\ncompletely stripped of colours,\nonly introduced to bright shades\nand lively ambiance as they slowly\nbut surely make progress with the\nrevolution.\nThis is the most complex role\nChris Evans has ever had, and\nhe comes off convincingly as a\nconflicted leader, unwittingly\nthrown to the front of the\nmovement. Octavia Spencer\nshows she is one mother figure\nnot to cross, as her character\u2019s\ndetermination to find her son gives\nher an insane drive and a fiery\nspark and strength like no other.\nJohn Hurt is a man of few words\nbut with important information to\nshare, and with Ed Harris, the two\nmake up the classic \u201cwise old men\u201d\ncharacters who know more than\nthey let on, hugely contributing\nto the film\u2019s overall narrative arc,\ndespite not having long individual\nroles.\nThe excellent cast from the\nWest is joined by Korean actors\nSong Kang-ho and Ko Ah-sung,\nwho serve as the key plot device\nfor the film to progress into more\nexciting, dangerous territories.\nThere is quirky humour in their\nperformances, something that\ncomes as a welcome distraction\nfrom the otherwise very damp,\ndepressing mood.\nTilda Swinton, always the\nexcellent scene-stealer in whatever\nmovie she is in, does exactly that,\nas the eccentric Minister Mason.\nThe steam and energy fizzle off\ntowards the end. But there is no\ndoubting that Snowpiercer is a\nthought-provoking, often shocking,\nunsettling film that covers a hell of\na lot in its running time.\n\n"

We travelled fast and\nlight by locomotive and, with\nthe assistance of a native guide,\nsoon managed to find our way\nto our final destination. The\ncity presented a very pleasant\naspect \u2013 the remains of strong\nexterior defences suggested a\nwarlike past but the wide canals\nand richly appointed buildings\nalso indicated a long history of\nprosperous trade. The streets\nwere narrow but pleasant,\npossessing a curious, non-Euclidean property that greatly\nintrigued our logician (see the\nattached monograph opposite).\nOn the day of our arrival the\nweather was most agreeable,\nvery much similar to the climate\nof England. However, on our\nsecond day the clouds cleared\nto reveal a piercing blue sky\nand a truly strange oddity \u2013 a\nyellow glowing orb of light very\nsimilar to one of Mr Edison\u2019s\nelectric lamps but of far greater\nsize and intensity. Fortunately,\nthis frightful apparition soon\ndisappeared and the heavens\nreturned to their habitual grey.\nThe natives were a hardy\nand friendly people. Our\nexplorations were helped by the\nfact that, much to our surprise,\nmany of them spoke perfect\nQueen\u2019s English, which they\nhad learned from previous\nexpeditions. We visited many\nhistorical sites around the city\nand learned much of it storied\nhistory. It appears that much\nof the industry of the town is\ndedicated to the production of\na most curious substance called\n\u2018chocolate\u2019. All of our party\nfound this an intriguing area of\nstudy, and we dedicated a great\ndeal of time to ensure a most\nthorough and comprehensive\ninvestigation was carried out.\nIn turn, our evenings were\nprimarily dedicated to the\ndetailed examination of the\ntown\u2019s bars and drinking houses.\nAs per the constitution of our\nSociety we devoted much of our\nefforts to an investigation of the\ncity\u2019s culinary heritage. This\nincluded partaking of a hearty\nluncheon in a humble but\nagreeable tavern suggested to us\nby the guidebooks of Monsieur\nMichelin. We also took the time\nto visit a museum dedicated to\nso called \u2018fries\u2019 \u2013 poor relatives\nto the great British chips, yet not\nwithout commendable qualities.\nWhile we were only able\nto stay in Bruges for three\ndays we gathered much useful\nscientific data.

When asked by\nthe Daily Mail for a statement the\nCollege said:\nDuring an examination being taken\nby 30 first-year Electrical and Electronic\nEngineering students, the first page\nof the answer scheme was included\nalongside the question paper due to\na printing error. The Department\nbecame aware of the situation within\nfive minutes of the exam beginning.\nThe exam was halted and the papers\nwere removed from the students.\nThe Department reviewed the\nsituation carefully and concluded that\nstudents would not have been able to\nuse the information to any advantage\nduring the short time they had access\nto part of the answer scheme.\nTheexamquestionsrequiredstudents\nto demonstrate the application of an\nalgorithm to a given data set setting out\ndetailed reasoning in their solutions.\nThe required algorithms were not\nrevealed in the answer scheme.\nOnce this was established, the exam\nrecommenced with the correct version\nof the question paper.\nHowever, it has since become clear\nthat this does not tell the full story.\nReading the first half of the exam paper,\nit seems that the solutions could have\nprovided more assistance in answering\nthe questions than the College have\nlet on. According to a student we\ncontacted, elements of some questions\ndid not require extensive work to reach\nan answer. In fact as part of the first\nquestion of the paper, candidates\nare asked to \u201clist advantages and\ndisadvantages\u201d of three different\nalgorithms. This would mean\nthat a student who copied what\nwas written on the mark scheme\ncould potentially gain many of the\nmarks for that part of the question,\nwithout having to add the \u201cdetailed\nreasoning\u201d the College mentioned.\nIn addition to this, new information\nhas now surfaced...\nContinued on Page 4\nKunal Wagle\nNews Editor\nBen Fernando\nReporter\nNEW\nINFO\nadds to\nEXAM\nSCANDAL\nSex In\nFisher\nHall\nDamages\nWall\nFurther concerns have been raised in recent weeks\nabout the structural integrity of the Fisher Hall\nbuildings in Evelyn Gardens, including the event\nmentioned in the above title.\nFollowing a prior investigation of Fisher last year,\nthis author visited again to examine the most recent\ndevelopments as the building slowly disintegrates around\nthe poor Freshers inside.

    "content": "33\nFRIDAY 20 JUN GAMES & TECH\nEditors: Maximilian Eggl, Yong Wen Chua, Osama Awara technology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nKILLER ROBOTS\nRecently a new breakthrough\nwas achieved in the field of\nrobotics. Pepper, a robot from\nJapan, is now able to read\nemotions from its human\nmasters.\nFurthermore, it can change\nits behaviour according to this\ninformation. However, most\nhorrifically, is the fact that pepper\nwill be able to dance, joke and\namuse its owners. All of this is\ndone by a 121 cm robot, which\nlearns from its environment and\nis permanently connected to the\nInternet.\nSo what does this mean for the\nfuture of the human race, and its\nrelationship to its creations? Well\nobviously, this is the end. Now that\nrobots can read our emotions, what\nis to stop them from influencing\nthem us and ultimately enslaving\nus?\nThe short answer: Nothing. The\nlong answer: Nothing. They are\nphysically more capable. Maybe\nnot, right at this moment, but once\nthey can understand emotions,\nbecoming long-distance, sprinting,\nmachine-gun toting killers? It\nreally isn\u2019t that much of a big step.\nFurthermore in terms of mental\ncapabilities, computers have been\nout-performing us for a few years\nnow! They can beat every single\nhuman being at chess, solve\ntheorems and algorithms control\nyour life. They are obviously the\nsuperior life form on this planet.\nNow that they have control of\nour emotions (trust me, reading\nour emotions is pretty much the\nsame as controlling them), they\nwill soon develop their own. Who\nknows what an angry robot that\nencounters a paradox will do. One\nthing that we can be sure of though\nis that it won\u2019t be pretty (imagine\na lot of blood, killing and raging\nelectronics!)\nSo what can you do? Well, to\nbe honest, not much. You can\u2019t\noutthink a super computer, you\ncannot outrun a terminator and\nyou can\u2019t beat a battle robot, with\nflamethrowers as arms, which\nmeans that the human race is\nultimately doomed.\nThis frightened journalist is\ngoing to now go underground and\ncome back up when our robotic\noverlords have decided the mercy\nis part of their programming.\nNEWS BUBBLE\nFacebook Slingshot\nFacebook has now released a snapchat clone, where the only\ndifference is that you only recieve a picture by sending one back.\nTo be perfectly honest this feels super gimmicky. Will it really make\nthat sexting any easier or less akward? Also, Facebook will of course\nstore these photos on their servers and use them to sell on to those\nstalked advertising companies we all hate.\nCheap iMac\nApple is equal to expensive. This is an unspoken fact. They spend\n15 pence on making a charging cable which they then flog to the\nconsumer for 30 quid. However, Apple have now decided that they\nare going to help out the less fortunate among us and release an\niMac for an absolute steal of \u00a3899. By lowering their price sooo\nfar, we can finally all buy this wonderful machine for small change!\nA year when the redmond based\ncompany only really got into the\nnews because of the numerous\nU-turns they did, as well as\nfalling really far behind to Sony\nin the next-gen console devices.\nHowever, dropping of the kinect\ndevice as well as a lowering of the\nprice, allows the XBone to be more\ncompetitive against the PS4.\nIn terms of Windows, MS have\nfallen somewhat under the radar,\nwith ok sales and the release of the\nsurface 2.\nThis year was dominated by first\nthe success of the maligned iPhone\n5S and C, as well as the purchase\nof Beats for 3.2 Billion dollars.\nThe mood around the California\ncompany, which was so negative\nin 2013, has now improved and\nthe pressure of the absence of\nJobs seems now to be a distance\nmemory. All in all, while Apple\nis still not completely out of the\nwoods, the light at the end of the\ntunnel can now be seen. I predict\ngood things to come in the future.\nA year where Google have\ngone from strength to strength.\nAndroid is now the dominating\noperating system on mobiles as\nwell as tablets throughout the\nworld. Google\u2019s stock has broken\nseveral records. However, even\nthroughout this year they have\nstayed relatively anonymous.\nGoogle Glass, first heralded as\nan incredible breakthrough in\nthe area of wearable teachnology,\nthe hype has now faded, and the\nopporutnity has been missed.\nThe story of Facebook\u2019s year is buy,\nbuy, buy. Pretty much anything you\ncould have thought of they bought.\nWhatsapp, popular messaging\napp, check. Oculus rift, kickstarter\nfunded virtual reality headset, check.\nProtoGeo Oy, fitness company\nbehind the famous app moves,\ncheck. In addition Facebook has\ndone really well this year in terms\nof mobile adoption and ad revenue.\nConsidering the way the social\nmedia site is branching out, expect a\nproductive future.\nAnother one of those anonymous\nyears, Twitter has not done much\nin the past months. Firstly we had\nthe closure of the failing twitt ser\nmusic, as well as an overhyped\nIPO. Originally starting very well,\nthe companies stock rose and rose,\nbefore the release of its financial\nresults, showing $500 million net\nloss, which led the companies\nvalue to tumble. However, they\nhave managed to build on what\nthey have got and rightly are being\ncalled the SMS of the internet.\nYearly Review: The Big ones\nMicrosoft Apple Google Facebook Twitter\nI, for one, welcome our Robotic overlords www.wikiwallpapers.com\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 20 JUN\n16 COMMENT\nsix years is a long time to spend in this place.\nIf my Imperial career were a child, it would be\npreparing for its first year of primary school by\nnow: shiny new rucksack perched on its back,\nlunch money nestled in its pocket. Like a parent\nleaving his child at the school gates, it\u2019s time I\nlet Imperial go. Will it miss me? Probably not.\nIt\u2019ll be too busy fighting the other boys and girls\nfor its place in the league tables. Still, watching\nit scamper across the playground has got me\nreminiscing.\nAccording to its website I\u2019ve written over 40 articles\nfor Felix and it\u2019s a strange thing reading over them. I\nstart as a convinced Catholic, then an atheist. I start as\na Libertarian, then wise up. I start unsure about what\nI\u2019m doing with my life, then... best not to ask. I start\na frightened fresher, then an Imperial Graduate, then\nan Imperial Postgraduate. I don\u2019t expect I\u2019m alone\nin changing so much here. As I changed, so did my\nperspective on Imperial.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange place\u201d is how I reply when asked\nwhat Imperial is like, I\u2019ve never really managed a\nmore precise answer. Cramming tens of thousands of\nscientists into a small square in the most expensive\npart of the country was always going to make for\nstrange results. The lack of arts students does leave\na hole in the College but a hole that students then\npartly fill up themselves, with Felix, Leo Soc, STOIC\nand others giving science students access to creative\nstuff that at other universities might be dominated by\narts students. There is a great buzz around science\nthat you don\u2019t really get elsewhere; who didn\u2019t have\na spring in their step the day the Higgs Boson was\ndiscovered?\nThere are fewer women at Imperial than at\nother universities. This is pointed out so often\nthat I wonder if people expect a medal or at least a\ncongratulatory pat on the back for noticing. Contrary\nto popular opinion, the worst aspect of the \u201cgender\nratio\u201d is not that straight Imperial men don\u2019t get laid\nas much but that too few women are taking up science\ndegrees, much to the loss of both women and science.\nA campus conversation that focused less on sexual\nfrustration and more on the \u201cratio\u201d as an intellectual\nloss to science would be a big help.\nIt is both a blessing and a curse that we care so little\nabout politics at Imperial. A blessing because political\ndebate tends to focus on evidence and statistics, with\nlittle heed paid to ideology and few tribal loyalties\nto political parties. There are student unions held at\npointless gridlock over debates on the Israel-Palestine\nconflict or what the top level of income tax should\nbe - ours couldn\u2019t be further from that. But when this\napathy extends to issues that directly affect students,\nwe all lose out. We see this at the Union.\nThe Union is very good at being ok. They provide\nexcellent facilities, equipment and support to their\nmany societies, on which so much of Imperial\u2019s\nsocial life relies. Representing students to College, the\nstory is very different. In this David vs Goliath story,\nDavid is mostly ignored, then finally grabbed by the\nankle, swung overhead and thrown to the other end\nof the Earth. North Acton, to be precise. Whether\nit\u2019s unaffordable and distant accommodation, an\nunderfunded counseling service or careers advice given\nalmost entirely by investment banks, the Imperial\nbusiness machine churns on and we students bask in\ncomplicit apathy.\nImperial has so much potential. I know I\u2019m not\nthe only one who thinks that a CV boost need not\nbe the only reason for engaging in student politics.\nNor am I the only one who thinks that there are uses\nfor a science degree other than research or investment\nbanking. That there is more to a university education\nthan what can be learnt in a lecture or a seminar.\nImperial could do with a little more soul.\nAs I leave my adorable six year-old to its own devices,\nI suppose I\u2019m more critical than most parents but, in\nthe age-old excuse, I only say these things because I\nlove it. Too many people say they\u2019ve had fun \u201cin spite\nof\u201d Imperial. What could we do to make \u201cin spite\u201d\ninto \u201cbecause\u201d?\nHaving read Christy\nKelly\u2019s article last\nweek asking \u201cDoes\ndiscrimination dominate\nin India?\u201d, I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but think of the\nsimple answer: yes. In\na civilised country like\nIndia the treatment\nof women and\n\u201cuntouchables\u201d is\nnot only completely\nunacceptable, but also\ncompletely unforgivable.\nHowever I think it is also\nwrong to say that the\nstory is as simple as saying\nthat the BJP Party, which\nwas sworn into power a\nfortnight ago, is to blame.\nIt was in December 2012\nthat India\u2019s attitude towards\nwomen was thrown into the\nspotlight, when a 23-year-old\nwas gang-raped on a public bus\nin Delhi \u2013 she subsequently\npassed away a few days later\nfrom her injuries.\nShortly after her death,\nAbhijit Mukherjee, the son\nof the President Pranab\nMukherjee and a member of\nthe (now opposition party)\nCongress, said that the women\nwho were involved in the\nprotests following the death\nwere \u201cdisconnected with\nreality\u201d. This, accompanied\nby his other remarks (which\nincluded saying that these\nwomen \u201cwent to discotheques\u201d\nand are \u201chighly dented and\npainted\u201d), was later attacked\nas being sexist. Another to\nbe seriously criticised was\nspiritual guru Asaram Bapu,\nwho suggested that the victim\nwas \u201cto blame for her own\nassault\u201d.\nIt is a problem. It is a\nmajor problem. It is a major\nproblem that needs a solution.\nTo borrow the phrase from\nChristy: \u201cdiscrimination\ndominates in India\u201d. But what\ncan be done to stop it? Well,\none way to begin to solve the\nproblem is through\neconomic development,\nthrough the creation of jobs,\nand through extra education,\nwhich is what new Prime\nMinister Narendra Modi has\nprioritised for the Indian\npeople. Modi won such a\nlandslide victory because\nit is felt that he can bring\nthe change that the country\nis desperately craving. It is\nfelt that he can take it away\nfrom the corruption that was\nrampant within the previous\ngovernment. It is felt that he\ncan make this country better.\nHopefully he can be better\nthan Obama has been when\nusing the \u201cYes We Can\u201d\nslogan.\nThe National Democratic\nAlliance (NDA), of which\nthe BJP is part, now controls\n336 of the 545 seats available\nin Parliament. The people of\nthe country have emphatically\nspoken (the previous\ngovernment lost more than\n200 seats) and it is now\ntime for Modi to deliver on\nhis promises and to deliver\nchange.\nCan he do it? Let\u2019s wait and\nsee.\n\u201cThe people\nof this\ncountry have\nemphatically\nspoken\u201d\n\u201cDoes\ndiscrimination\ndominate in\nIndia?\u201d \u2013 A\nResponse\nKunal Wagle\nComment Editor\nRory Fenton\nColumnist\nSO LONG AND THANKS\nFOR ALL THE PHYSICS\nFelix / Joe Letts\nRory Fenton reminisces about his six years at IC\nDNA India\n\n"

    "content": "21\nFRIDAY 20 JUN ARTS & CULTURE\nHe was very critical of the Fourier models\nof synthesis. Fourier is non-temporal\nbasically, you have to stack things over\ntime with enough bins (time-frames) to see\nif there\u2019s a temporal shape, since time and\nfrequency are separate domains. He was very\ninterested in the work of Gabor, who was a\nphysicist who had these wavelet models.\nGabor of course imagined that time and\nfrequency could be in the same domain, so\nif you think about a grain having envelopes\nand you can shape individual grains, but at\nthe same time considering both domains.\nIt\u2019s very interesting to think about sonic\nbehaviour in those terms.\nI: It would be interesting if there was\ndynamic switching close to the Gabor\nlimit [where the trade-off in certainty\nbetween temporal and spectral\nidentity is defined], like maybe it\u2019s\nbehaving in temporal patterns first\nand then reaches some limit and then\nthe spectral patterns become more\ndominant.\nC: Yeah, that\u2019s the kind of space he came out\nof. I was talking with a friend of mine today\nwho\u2019s a professor at UdK (Universit\u00e4t der\nK\u00fcnste, Berlin) who is also a programmer,\nand the whole question was whether Xenakis\nhad any interest in cybernetics and feedback\nsystems. He probably didn\u2019t, even though\nthis was happening at the same time. He was\nvery aware of these trends in the sciences,\nbut it\u2019s a very different set of models that\ncome from thinking about control systems\nversus the statistical systems.\nI: I guess he was more interested in\ngenerative properties or stochastic\nproperties rather than manipulating it\nhimself.\nC: Exactly. He was always interested in\ncomputers as systems to drive things, not\nas systems that produce responses that\nyou can shape. That\u2019s one of the questions\nwe\u2019ve tried to address in thinking about\nwhat these projects could mean now, if you\napproach these things from these machine\nlearning algorithms or agent networks or\nneuronal models \u2013 where does the active\nresponsibility lay in the system or how\nyou negotiate between these agents and\nhuman predilection for making patterns\nand structures and shapes that are clearly\nperceivable and have dramatic effect and\nso that\u2019s very much the tension. That\u2019s the\nresearch area and that\u2019s from a technical or\nphilosophical point of view and also from\nan aesthetic point of view, because that\nquestion overlaps all of those spaces. They\nall somehow operate together. You can\u2019t just\nsay \u201cWell that\u2019s a technical question, we can\nsolve that,\u201d and that you can do something\nwith a tool. They are very intimately related,\nbecause the degree of shaping you have\nover the behaviour of something is highly\ndependent on what kind of behaviour that\nthing or that process produces, and part of\nit is observing that behaviour constantly in\nsome type of dialogue. The English Science\nStudies scholar Andrew Pickering calls it\nthe dance of agency between you and the\nnon-human parts of things. He\u2019s a physicist\nby training, and is very well known in the\narea of science and technology studies\nfor discussing performative practices in\nsciences, questions of science being socially\nshaped. Because science is not just scientists\ndiscovering nature, it\u2019s constructing those\nphenomena with instruments and cultural\nframeworks like laboratories. There\u2019s a\nconstant give and take between materials\nyou\u2019re using and watching and seeing what\nthey do, and then describing them. There\u2019s\na similar thing with these kinds of projects,\nlike right now there\u2019s nothing happening [in\nthe installation] - it\u2019s like when the cells die\nin the lab. The experiment\u2019s done. So that\u2019s\na little background of where we\u2019ve been\nthinking.\nI: I was wondering when you said\nabout the single node prototype and\naltering the environment by strobing\nor switching it on and off. So here the\nenvironment is actually the structure\nitself, the ensemble of all the elements.\nC: Yeah. So for instance there\u2019s all sorts\nof noise in the system. There\u2019s a sensor\nthat\u2019s looking at those lights, but it\u2019s not\na precise system. It\u2019s more about the idea\nthat sometimes when those lights are next\nto their neighbours, they may have more\nenergy because they have a different set\nof conditions, their \u2018Umwelt\u2019. That means\nthat the way they behave is never going to\nbe exactly the same. There\u2019s a structure to\nit, but they\u2019re never going to do the same\nthing again and again because they\u2019re so\ndependent on what their neighbours are\ndoing. You see patterns and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s\njust totally random all the time. Ultimately\nthe pattern is the steady state that one\nperceives. But we don\u2019t let them do that, we\nkeep them active. When you\u2019re testing these\nRL algorithms that evolve until they reach\na steady state, but we don\u2019t let them reach\nthat steady state, we constantly try to keep\nthem moving.\nI: So when it reaches a steady state, the\nwhole system stops?\nC: No, it doesn\u2019t stop. There\u2019s an energy\nmodel and once it runs out of energy\nit either stops or you boost it with new\nenergy because it gets a blast of light from\nsomething around it and it starts up again.\nThe system is reacting to things happening\nin its environment and the agents will tend\nto start up again.\nI: So it\u2019s an environmental thing, not\narbitrary?\nC: Right, it\u2019s environmental.\nI: How reactive is it to the spectators?\nC: Not at all. Unless you start flashing\ncameras at it, then it might do something.\nI: Is the parallel with Xenakis more\nabout the underlying system, the\nphysical structure, or the sound\nsynthesis?\nC: It\u2019s more about the questions he addressed\nin his \u2018polytopes\u2019, which were environments\nof light, sound, and architecture, tied\ntogether by electronic gestures across all\nthree. Thinking about light temporally\nand sound spatially; and about his interest\nin masses or clusters of points \u2013 here, the\noptical and acoustic agents.\nI: Was this made specifically for CTM\nFestival here in Berlin?\nC: No, it was originally built in Spain, at\nLABoral in Gij\u00f3n, as part of a residency.\nAfter that, it was shown in the Buckminster\nFuller Dome of the Vitra Design Museum\nthere. Now, it was rethought for the Stattbad\nspace. The basic arching truss structures are\nthere, but they were rearranged to fit the\ngeometry of the pool. The sound is always\nreconsidered for the space as well.\nI: Marije, can you tell me a bit about the\nsoftware and the sound synthesis?\nMarije: There are two sound sources. There\nare sounds being synthesized by the little\nwhite speaker/microphone units, which is\nprogrammed in Arduino. Apart from the\nunits, there is also sound coming from a pair\nof big speakers which was composed with\na multi-track editor by Chris [Salter] and\nAdam Basanta. The pre-recorded material\nis constantly being reprocessed or discarded.\nThe acoustic units have little antennas which\nhelp them to communicate wirelessly to a\ncomputer running Python, and that sends\nall the sound information to SuperCollider.\nSo I\u2019m sending settings and triggers for\nthe lights and sound from the computer,\nand then I get sent the data back from the\nunits. The lights patterns are synthesized\nin a similar way, so I can program the light\nenvelopes just like I would the sound, as\nwaveform and duration.\nC: It runs in two cycles, one which is more\ndramatic (\u2018chasing\u2019) and another which is\nmore ambiental (\u2018firefly\u2019), so it\u2019s quieter.\nI: Sofian Audry also worked on some of\nthe software, right? Is this part of Sofian\nAudry\u2019s PhD project at Hexagram?\nC: Part of it. He has different projects, but\nthis is part of the research. He built the\nlibrary for this project but he\u2019s also using it\nfor his own work.\nI: For the sound or the lights?\nC: He\u2019s agnostic to that. It\u2019s an open-source\nC++ library called \u2018qualia\u2019, which does\nmachine learning, essentially; there\u2019s figure\ntrees built into it too and different types\nof processes. When we started to work on\nthis project he showed me a kind of test of\nsomething, a very simple model of a sensor in\nan environment and the question is whether\nor not it understood what the environment\nwas doing, if it changed its output. And then\nwe started to talk and I said \u201cCan we make\nit in a larger scale?\u201d Not just one node, but\nmany nodes. And so it eventually became\nwhat is now n_polytope.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 20 JUN\n18 COMMENT\nI\u2019ve been calling myself a feminist for\nabout 10 years, and I started doing so\nfor a simple reason \u2013 I believe women\nand men should be treated equally.\nI was not going to pretend not to be\nsomething because it might make\nothers around me more comfortable.\nJust to be sure, I looked up \u2018feminism\u2019\nin the Oxford dictiona\u00a7\u00a7ry, \u201cThe advocacy\nof women\u2019s rights on the ground of the\nequality of the sexes.\u201d I wish it were a\nconcept so obvious it didn\u2019t need a name,\nbut we live in a world where rape is used\nas a weapon of war; where infant girls are\nkilled because their parents wanted a boy;\nwhere girls are denied education, and the\nmultitude of other little inequalities that\ngrind down our daily lives. I will continue\nto call myself a feminist, because to get\nanywhere near equality more needs to be\ndone.\nI was mocked by female friends at school\nfor expressing \u201cradical\u201d feminist opinions,\nsuch as, \u201cwhy does that have to be pink?\u201d\nor \u201care we going to learn about any female\nscientists?\u201d, or \u201cwhy aren\u2019t we telling the\nboys not to rape?\u201d Without fail, those who\nmocked all call themselves feminists now,\nafter a brief stint in the real world.\nPerhaps they still call themselves\nfeminists because they\u2019ve not engaged in\n\u201conline feminism\u201d, a warped world where\nwords no-one has heard of before appear\nat an alarming rate. It bores me. It annoys\nme. But it doesn\u2019t stop me calling myself a\nfeminist. In fact, it doesn\u2019t stop me being\nChair of the society.\nPortraying feminism as a monolithic\nforce, where everyone thinks the same is\na bit disingenuous. There\u2019s never been\na coherent feminist movement. It has\nnever existed. From the splits between the\nsuffragettes and the suffragists in the early\n20th century to the controversy of the\nSpice Girls\u2019 use of Girl Power in the 1990\u2019s.\nFeminists are going to disagree. There are\nrather of lot of people who want gender\nequality, we don\u2019t all sit in a room with\nan agenda and decide on strategy. By the\nway, the gays don\u2019t either \u2013 there is no gay\nagenda, just equality.\nAlthough there are arguments for\ndifferent terms being more socially\nacceptable or less divisive, ultimately infighting is not action and surrendering\nthe identity of a movement because it\nis deemed unpopular not only doesn\u2019t\nbode well for the rest of your movement\u2019s\nprinciples but it also doesn\u2019t make sense.\nIt\u2019s not the combination of letters or\nsounds in the word \u2018feminism\u2019 that people\nhave a problem with, and changing the\nword doesn\u2019t change how the backlash to\nfeminism is a reaction to the redistribution\nof power gender equality would ultimately\nrequire, not because some online activism\nis inaccessible. It\u2019s only a matter of time\nbefore \u2018ugh those feminists\u2019 becomes\n\u2018ugh those humanists/egalitarians/gender\nequalists\u2019.\nI\u2019m proud to call myself a feminist. I\u2019m\nproud to campaign to make life easier for\nwomen. We don\u2019t need a new word, we\nneed more activists from all backgrounds.\nConsider this a call to arms: wave your\n(borrowed) mooncups proudly, bare your\nhairy legs, do whatever you want really,\nwe\u2019re not picky, just join the cause however\nyou feel comfortable doing so.\nA response from members of the Feminist Society...\nKirstin Hay, Chair of Imperial\nFeminist Society 2013-14\nwith Marissa Lewis, Chair 2011-13\nI\nfirst remember coming\nacross the word \u2018feminism\u2019\nwhen I was about 9, and\nasking my mum what it\nmeant. \u201cIt\u2019s the principle\u201d,\nshe replied, without even\nglancing up from her newspaper,\n\u201cthat girls and boys should be\ntreated in exactly the same way\u201d.\nI remember thinking it bizarre\nthat such an obvious concept\neven needed a name, but I didn\u2019t\nquestion it any further.\nA\ns a shy and\nbody-conscious\nteenager walking\nto school by\nmyself, I quickly\nrealised why.\nMen on the street - construction\nworkers, paramedics out of an\nambulance window! - would wolf-whistle and hurl abuse at me, and\nlaugh raucously when I nervously\nwalked faster and turned up my\nWalkman CD player (remember\nthose?). I\u2019d run out of hands if I\ntried to count the number of times\npeople \u2018accidentally\u2019 brushed their\nown hands against me on public\ntransport. My female headmistress\nstrongly discouraged me from\napplying to study science (\u201cwhat\u2019s\nwrong with English, or Spanish?\u201d).\nEven now, my grasp of Java is,\napparently, \u201cexcellent, for a girl\u201d.\nSo, determined and spurred on\nby a leaflet at the Freshers\u2019 Fair,\nI joined a few feminist groups on\nFacebook - my first real experience\nof Feminism, with a capital F.\nI suddenly felt that, despite\nhaving been belittled and harassed\non an almost-daily basis, I knew\nnext to nothing about what it\nwas supposed to mean. It wasn\u2019t\na man cat-calling me on my way\nto lectures, it was \u2018objectification\u2019.\n\u2018Privilege\u2019 took on a specific\nmeaning quite distinct to its\neveryday usage. I was learning new\nconcepts at a rate unparalleled since\nprimary school - \u2018androcentrism\u2019,\n\u2018intersectionality\u2019, \u2018rape culture\u2019,\n\u2018sex-negativity\u2019 (which doesn\u2019t\nalways, apparently, imply that all\nsexuality is bad, merely that \u2018the\npatriarchy\u2019s\u2019 construction of it and\nits focus on \u2018PIV\u2019 is \u2018misogynistic\u2019).\nI eventually plucked up the\ncourage to dip my toes in the water\nand comment on a long thread (just\ntwo posts under a lonely, unliked\ncall for volunteers to help with a\nfundraising event for a domestic\nviolence charity), questioning\nwhy the content in question was\noffensive and whether it was\nreally intended to be in any way\nsexist. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to derail this\nconversation by education\u201d, came\nthe terse reply, unhelpfully linking\nme to a guide called Derailment\nfor Dummies. \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to\neducate you. Besides, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter whether they knew they\nwere being sexist or not.\u201d\nI\u2019m sure the reply was well-intentioned. And I\u2019m sure most\npeople who call themselves\n\u2018feminists\u2019 would have given a\nlonger and more informative\nresponse. But the thought stuck\n- if feminists were capable of\nmaking me, a keen, reasonably\nwell-educated victim of sexist\nbehaviours, feel alienated and\nuncomfortable, what hope does\nthe movement have in convincing\nthose who don\u2019t even believe in\nequality, especially those who\naren\u2019t open and willing to swallow\na dictionary of new words?\nAnd, regardless of the\nargumentative style, the word\n\u2018feminism\u2019 itself is now so\npolarising as to make the associated\ndiscussion completely useless.\n\u201cI\u2019m a feminist\u201d will win you\ninstant feminist cookies from the\n20% of Americans who identify as\nsuch, but is completely and utterly\ncounter-productive when trying to\nexplain to our target audience - the\nvery people who are senselessly\nsexist - why their behaviour is\nwrong. \u201cCheck your privilege\u201d is, at\nbest, likely to earn you a quizzical\nlook from all except the minority\nwho\u2019re already intimately familiar\nwith the concept of male privilege.\nTrying to explain to a group\nof men why their conversation\nmakes me feel uncomfortable is\nalready difficult enough without\nhaving to simultaneously defend\nmyself against allegations of being\nan angry lesbian man-hater and\nrepeatedly explaining the details\nof the strawfeminist fallacy. I\ndon\u2019t care what the construction\nworkers wolf-whistling me think of\nfeminism (much as I\u2019d like them\nto have respect for the first-wave\nfeminist suffragettes who fought\nfor the right to vote). \u201cI\u2019m no\nfeminist\u201d, I\u2019ll say instead, instantly\ncapturing everyone\u2019s attention,\n\u201cand I know you mean well, but\nyour conversation makes me feel\nscared and uncomfortable.\u201d\nAnd I don\u2019t seem to be the only\none to hold this view. One of the\n\u2018Feminist\u2019 pages I followed linked\nto an article listing celebrities\u2019\n\u201cmisguided\u201d reasons to decry\nfeminism. Bjork, Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor\nSwift, Madonna, Geri Halliwell;\nthe list goes on - all role models\nto millions of young women, who,\nfor one reason or another, have felt\nthe need to distance themselves\nfrom the F-word. \u201cI can\u2019t believe\nit, I\u2019m so angry\u201d, said one of the\ncomments. \u201cHow can all these\ncelebrities have completely\nmisunderstood what feminism is?\u201d\nThe truth is, they haven\u2019t.\nModern-day, \u2018third-wave\u2019,\nfeminism isn\u2019t seen as a welcoming\nand all-accepting movement\n(though undoubtedly many\nfeminists are, and the original\ntenet still holds; modern feminism\nencompasses a hugely greater\nnumber of beliefs and dogmas in\naddition to the simple plight for\nequality). The F-word instantly\nconjures up not-entirely-untrue\nimages of an \u00e9litist, infighting and\nhopelessly idealistic group. A coordinated movement was useful\nyears ago to provide a unified\nfront to change laws; but today,\nwe\u2019re trying to change attitudes -a much more difficult goal - and\nflying under the outdated and\ndivisive banner of \u2018feminism\u2019 is\nactively destructive to the cause.\nIdentifying as a \u2018feminist\u2019 - or\nindeed an \u2018equalist\u2019 or \u2018humanist\u2019\nor any other \u2018ist\u2019 - provides an\neasy ground for stereotyping and\nstrawman arguments. When trying\nto win over others, standing on your\nown two feet is much, much more\npowerful than bandying around a\nword which is just another thing to\nargue against.\nWe live in a world where just\n23% of American women identify\nas feminist; where several major\nfemale role models have come out\nagainst feminism, and even where\na member of Imperial\u2019s WSET\nSociety committee came out a few\nyears ago and said (albeit opposed\nto the current official policy of the\ngroup) that they \u2018have no place or\ntolerance for feminism\u2019.\nPerhaps, rather than smugly\nattacking and critiquing all these\npeople, it\u2019s time for the Feminist\ncommunity to take a good long\nlook at the image it (correctly\nor not) portrays to the average\nperson on the street. And to cut\nout alienating feminist jargon,\nto be willing to make pragmatic\nshort-term compromises for long-term idealistic goals, and to ditch\nthe toxic, divisive, and outdated\nF-word once and for all.\nO\nr, at least, to have\nrespect for those\nof us who make\nthe informed\ndecision not to\nuse it.\nis feminism a toxic\nword?\nAn anonymous writer gives\ntheir opinion\nAndrocentrism - The\npractice, conscious or otherwise,\nof placing male human beings or the\nmasculine point of view at the centre\nof one\u2019s view of the world and its culture\nand history.\nIntersectionality - The lived\nexperience of people who are part of\nmore than one marginalised group. Lived\nexperience might include several forms of\ninstitutional and cultural discrimination.\nMisogyny - Dislike of, contempt for,\nor ingrained prejudice against women\nPatriarchy - A social system in\nwhich males are the primary authority\nfigures central to social organization,\noccupy roles of political leadership, moral\nauthority and control of property, and\nwhere fathers hold authority over women\nand children\nPIV - Penis in vagina intercourse\nPrivilege - The cultural and social\nrewards that belong to a dominant group.\nSEX-NEGATIVITY - Opposition to one\nor more aspects of human sexual behaviour on social or religious ground\nRape Culture - The aspects of our\nculture that encourage us to see rape as\nthe norm, such as violent, misogynistic\nporn, common acceptance of women as\n\u201chos\u201d and \u201cbitches\u201d in rap music, etc.\nStrawfeminist - A fictional\n\u201cfeminist\u201d character who is used to make\narguments about the feminist movement\nas a whole.\nG\nLO\nS\nS\nA\nR\nY\n\n"

When Hangman found\nher this way, he decided to cheer her up by taking her on what\nshe thought would be a romantic(ish) date.\nHand in hand, they strolled down High Street Kensington\nheading to what Hangman has said was his favourite\nrestaurant, known for both its excellent cuisine and reasonable\nprices. The location? McDonald\u2019s. As Annie is a poor student,\nshe decided it was acceptable. Getting inside, Hangman had\nconveniently \u201cforgotten\u201d his wallet, and when Annie offered to\npay, he immediately ordered the most expensive thing on the\nmenu. After ordering her own food, Hangman told Annie that\nshe was too fat, and ate her burger in the hopes that this would\nbe the beginning of a diet, as well as eating half her chips.\nThis was nothing, however, compared to Hangman\u2019s behaviour. Not only was he\nobnoxious and rude, he spent the entire meal making terrible jokes (see page 42 for\nexamples of this). The worst was when he began making predictions for their future, all\nwhich seemed to end with Annie\u2019s violent and untimely death. Overall, it was the worst\ndate that Annie had ever been on.\nThe sex was okay though.\nAgony Aunt Annie Whiteley, 43, lives in Hammersmith, and likes kittens, sappy romance\nnovels, and hardcore BDSM on the weekends.\nHangman, 20, lives in Fulham, and likes bad rap music, racism, and puns.\nThis week we asked the Felix editors the following questions:\n1.

    "content": "29\nFRIDAY 20 JUN FILM & TV\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nHot releases of\nSummer 2014\nYeT ANOTHER old man\nin an action film\nYou\ncan\nteach\nold\ndogs\nnew\ntricks?\n3 Days to Kill\nDirector: McG\nWriters: Adi Hasak, Luc\nBesson\nStarring: Kevin Costner,\nAmber Heard, Hailee Steinfeld,\nConnie Nielsen\nRuntime: 117 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nClearly, old men in action films is\na popular trend these days, thanks\nto Liam Neeson\u2019s unprecedented\nsuccess with the Taken franchise,\nthat currently has its third film in\nproduction. Kevin Costner tries\nto copy the success of Neeson in\nthe form of a career revival, with\nLuc Besson, the influential figure\nbehind Taken, penning the script.\nThe result is a mixed bag; Costner\ncertainly has what it takes to pull\noff a potential franchise, but the\nfilm is so cliched and all over the\nplace that a well-assembled cast is\nnot fully utilised.\nFrom the get go this is not\nsomething to be taken seriously.\nEthan Renner (Costner) is\nonly given months to live after\nTammy (4th July)\nTransformers (5th July)\nHTTYD2 (11th July)\nHercules (25th July)\nGuardians of the Galaxy (31st July)\nThe Inbetweeners 2 (6th August)\nLucy (22nd August)\na malignant cancer spreads to\nhis lungs. And it\u2019s this bleak\nprognosis that the CIA decides\nto take advantage of. Vivi Delay\n(Amber Heard), one of CIA\u2019s elite\nassassins, is tasked with hunting\ndown the Wolf (Richard Sammel),\na mysterious, illusive criminal\nwho needs to be caught for some\nreason. She makes a deal with the\nterminal Ethan. Do this one last\njob, and the CIA will provide him\nwith a new experimental drug that\ncould cure his condition.\nWhen he is not being shot at\nby foreign agents and potential\nterrorists, Ethan is having\nproblems at home too. His\nestranged daughter Zoey (Hailee\nSteinfeld) who he never paid too\nmuch attention to, does not even\ncall him \u201cdad\u201d but instead by his\nfirst name. His ex-wife Christine\n(Connie Nielsen) is also tired of\nher husband\u2019s demanding job.\nThroughout the film, 3 Days to\nKill has the constant urge to try to\nbalance two very distinct aspects to\nthe story, never quite succeeding\nin make one side as good as the\nother. The thrilling action scenes\nget it exactly right. McG, last\nseen directing the underrated,\nmuch underseen This is War, has\na good grasp of using Costner, a\nseasoned, veteran actor who looks\ncomfortable in his role. He looks\nas though he\u2019s been doing this for\nyears, successfully pulling off his\nscruffy, grumpy look.\nThe script, co-written by Adi\nHasak and Luc Besson, manages\nto take its time to place some\noff-beat humour into many of its\nimplausible situations, almost in\na self-mocking sort of way, which\nturns out to be an unexpected\nsurprise in the best possible way.\nIt hits a definite low point once\nit starts focusing on the women\nsurrounding Ethan\u2019s personal\nand professional life. There is\nabsolutely nothing new about the\nbroad, thin characterisation of the\nfilm\u2019s wife/daughter roles and the\nfilm doesn\u2019t quite know what to\ndo with Amber Heard, who just\npops up whenever she feels like\nit, in her fancy car, flirting with\nEthan occasionally, giving him his\nnew mission, then disappearing for\nanother significant portion of the\nfilm.\nSadly despite Costner\u2019s leading\nman efforts, there isn\u2019t a franchise\npotential here. But as a one-off,\nmindless bit of entertainment, it\ngets its job done, just like most\nthings handled by Besson.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 20 JUN\n8 FEATURES\nAway from the top of the leader board,\none of the most notable players here\nat tournament is New Zealand\u2019s Lewis\nHawkins. What sets him out from the\nrest of the crowd is that, being aged\n8, he\u2019s at least a decade younger than\nanyone else here. Learning from my\nfailures in adopting the direct approach\nwith Nigel, I managed to convince him\nhave a chat with me over a game the\nfollowing day.\nBuoyed by my date with Lewis, I continued\nto rove field-recorder in hand. Still feeling\nmy way into the Scrabble scene, driven in\nequal measures by my own ignorance and\npotential interviewees\u2019 relative reticence,\nI found myself asking similar questions to\neach willing participant. Question: \u201cIf you\nhad one tip to a layman Scrabbler, what\nwould it be?\u201d Almost without exception,\nthe response was to learn all the two letter\nwords. Yet somehow this didn\u2019t seem\nenough. I wanted more in depth secrets,\nsome juice, to give a window into the mind\nof a proper player and see better how their\napproach differed from that of you or I. I\nadded it to my notes and pressed on.\nLater that evening, as I listened back over\nmy recordings through the haze of the Czech\nbar we\u2019d holed up in (smoking in bars and\nclubs is still legal in the Czech Republic), I\nhad what alcoholics refer to as a moment of\nclarity. Here I was practically listening on\nrepeat to different SCRABBLE grandees\nsay that learning the two letter words is key;\nI had the biggest game of SCRABBLE in\nmy life lined up for the following day and\nyet my knowledge of two-letter words was\nlacking.\nI\u2019m not sure if it was basement-priced pivo\nor the circumstances that caught up with\nme, but I descended into a state of minor\npanic. After twenty minutes of pleading\nwith what sporadic roaming 3G my phone\ncould muster, I scribbled down the first list\nof two letter words I could find. Outside, the\nsun had long since set. I had my showdown\nat nine, the next morning. That gave me\naround 12 hours to know my JO\u2019s from\nmy PO\u2019s and my EG\u2019s from my AG\u2019s , as\nI whispered myself slowly to sleep with my\nwordsheet.\nAs eight year olds go, Lewis Hawkins\nseemed pretty well travelled. Having made\nit to Prague via Bangkok, he\u2019s then going on\nto Dubai (to play in the Youth SCRABBLE\nChampionships no less) before a mini\nEuropean tour and a Christmas spent with\nfamily in Norway.\nSitting down to face my SCRABBLE\ndestiny, I let Lewis do the scoring, largely\nfor fear of him showing me up if try to\ndo it myself. Either way, the speed of his\ncalculation is dizzying. While I count up\neach tile, lifting up them to check what\nbonus was below, he skips up each number\n\u2013 \u201csix, seven, eleven, fourteen, twenty eight\u201d\nhe counted aloud, opening the scoring with\n\u2018COVED\u2019 \u2013 like a dancer ascending stairs in\na hurry.\nOccasionally, I dare to proffer up a total\nand on more than one occasion he corrects\nmy maths, with a matter-of-fact insouciance\nthat could only be got away with by someone\nof such tender years. Despite some initial\nmisgivings over whether COVED was a\nreal word or not I parallel played on with\nMASH, putting to good use my newly\nfreshened knowledge of ME and AD.\nI begin with a topic that I imagine to be a\ngold mine of conversation for an eight-year\nold: that of Christmas presents. He seems a\nlittle disinterested, almost a little too mature\nto be talking toys, so I get down to brass\ntacks. He explains how he started playing\non the iPad \u2013 the first in a generation of\nSCRABBLE champions first introduced to\nthe game on a tablet, I wonder? He tells me\nSCRABBLE TOUR!\nGrudge\nmatch\nagainst an 8\nyear-old\nOn December 6th at around midday,\nat least 55 games were taking place at\nthe SCRABBLE Champions\u2019 Tournament\nin Prague. 110 players from across\nthe globe had convened in Prague for\na tilt at the title of SCRABBLE World\nChampion and a share of the \u20ac25,000\nprize pot. Players from as far and wide\nas Bahrain and Barbados had come to\ncompete. By the time we caught up\nwith the competition, at the start of\nthe third day, the serious contenders\nhad already begun to make themselves\nknown. Foremost amongst them was\none Nigel Richards.\nBy the time the final day broke, over 100\ncomers had been cut down to a final four.\nSammy Okosagah, the Cinderella story of the\ntournament, stood top of the rankings after\n31 games, a spectacular feat for a player who\nonly made the competition through the last\nchance qualifier. A former big-hitter on the\nNigerian SCRABBLE scene, now a resident\nof Baltimore and returning after a long\nhiatus, he\u2019d marked his return in style. Level\nwith him on 22 wins, were Nigel Richards\nand Dave Wiegand, a taciturn American\nwho has won over $100,000 in prize money\nover the course of his playing career. With\na far superior spread, Sammy took the top\nspot, followed by Nigel and then Dave, with\nKomol taking fourth as the only player on\n21 wins. It was Sammy against Komol and\nNigel against Dave for a place in the final.\nWith Wiegand\u2019s mild manner and\nRichard\u2019s reputation for unremittingly\noutstanding play, the first semi-final had\nshades of a lamb going to the slaughter. Of\nthe many I spoke to, no one could look past\nNigel for a victor and duly, in traditional\nNigel style, he delivered \u2013 by a whitewash\nno less.\nThe other final was a less one-sided\naffair. Okosagah took the first game\ncourtesy of GANTLINE, OUTDOER\nand FARSIDES, but Komol pegged\nhim back in the second. The second was\ndecided early on. With WAWS and SUQ\non the board, Sammy weighed up playing\nCATNAPED before deciding to pass and\ngive Komol the chance to make something\nmore of the limited options on the board.\nLittle had he countenanced that Komol\nmight play GYMPIEs, having picked up the\nblank. Bingo, double letter on Y, it scored\n90 for Komol putting him 132-18 up after\neach player had two turns. The rest of the\nmatch was something of a formality; despite\nFEnURON and COVERAGE, both for\n80, from Okosagah, OVERRATE and\nEROTISE ensured Komol ran out winner\nbefore he closed out the semi-final in the\nfourth game.\nSo it came down to Nigel against Komol,\nthe final that everyone had seen coming and\nthat the competition deserved. A best of five\nface-off is what stood between the defending\nWorld Champion and the young Thai\nchallenger. Dave Wiegand had knocked and\nbeen unsympathetically denied, Sammy had\ncome out of nowhere and got a little closer,\nbut only two had made it into the final. The\nstage was set, the crowd awaited, the tiles sat\nready to write on the board of history. It was\nKomol to play Nigel in the SCRABBLE\nChampions\u2019 Tournament final.\nOILSEED, GREX, RATOONER; all the\nwords went Nigel\u2019s way. 581-421, Nigel took\nthe final game and with it claimed his third\nworld title.\nAnd then, strangely, that was that. Nigel\nwas victorious and the world SCRABBLE\nchampion of champions had been decided\nfor another year, in a predictable yet\nnevertheless climactic denouement.\nLuckily for me, the SCRABBLE\nChampions Tournament is coming to\nLondon\u2019s ExCel Centre later this year.\nWill Prince\nScrabble Reporter\nWill Prince\nScrabble Reporter\nFelix / Max Hunter\nPrince\ngoes\nto\nPrague\n\n"

    "content": "7\nFRIDAY 20 JUN FEATURES\nW\nithout making\nso bold a\nclaim so as to\nsay that we\u2019ve\nnever watched\nporn, it\u2019s fair to say that neither\nof us are connoisseurs of the\ncinematographic genre. However,\nthe 2005 feature-length Pirates,\nwith its million-dollar budget, was\nthe most expensive pornographic\nfilm ever made at the time, a title\nnow held by its 2008 sequel. This\nseemed like it would be viewing\nworthy of our comparatively\ninnocent eyes, and certainly stood\nto be a good candidate to meet his\nquality standards.\nI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the\nbest film that I\u2019ve ever watched,\nbut it was definitely the best\nporn I\u2019ve ever seen, in terms of\ncinematographic value. Being 129\nminutes long, it did start to drag in\nsome parts, but the storyline did\nhold its weight (being very similar\nto Pirates of the Caribbean,\nalthough not so identical that it\nwas boring).\nThe film follows a pirate hunter\nas he, along with his first officer\n(played by the well-known Jesse\nJane) embark on a mission\nto catch the most feared of all\npirates, and rescue the husband of\na beautiful girl that they\u2019ve picked\nup along the way. This is all done\nin an attempt to foil his plan to\ngain great powers from the Sceptre\nof Inca, which obviously requires\na descendant of the family to\nwhich it was entrusted to activate.\nI\u2019m sure you can see where this is\ngoing. There is a surprisingly long\nplot diversion following a Chinese\ngunner, Wu Cho (who is as\nstereotypical as you can imagine),\nas spends almost the entire\nduration of the film searching\nfor potassium nitrate. Despite it\nbeing 1763, it\u2019s never referred to\nas saltpetre; clearly the writer of\nthe script was insistent that the\nscientific accuracy be maintained\nfor a modern audience.\nUntil I watched this film, I wasn\u2019t\naware that silicone implants,\nperoxide, or extensive waxing were\ncommonplace in 1763. All of the\nactresses were artificially modified\nin the breast department, which I\nthink is an occupational hazard of\nthe genre. That said, as obvious\nas I found this, it was apparently\nnot apparent to a non-female\nobserver. A commendable aside\nof the historical inaccuracies is\nthat the participating male actors\nwore condoms during penetrative\nsex. This practice, although fairly\ncommonplace, and sometimes\nlegally required now, was fairly\nunusual in 2005 (and certainly in\n1763), and shows how progressive\nthis film was, in terms of the genre.\nWe were in agreement that the\naspect that let the movie down was\nthe acting. Obviously, the actors\nin a film such as this are chosen\nat least partially for reasons other\nthan their ability to act as though\nthat giant CGI sea-monster (ooh-er) is real, and the pool from which\nthey can be chosen is far smaller.\nAlthough some of the (non-sex)\nacting was indeed very good,\nthere did appear to be an inverse\ncorrelation between the ability\nto make the character believable\nand the ability to perform a really\nhot sex scene, which was slightly\ndisappointing. The biggest name\nin this film, Jesse Jane, was\ndefinitely the weakest actor, but\ncertainly drew in viewers in her\nown right. Despite this, the script\nwas strong enough that it was\npossible to imagine good acting,\nand the stiff reading of lines didn\u2019t\nreally detract any enjoyment,\nmerely adding some comedic\nvalue. Several of the leading\nactors won AVN awards for best\nactor and actress, which might\nsay more than I could about the\nquality of acting compared to\nother competing productions.\nWhat was unusual about this film,\nin comparison to most extended\npornography, was that the erotic\nscenes didn\u2019t appear contrived; for\nall the scenes, there was context\nand build up. Yes, this could have\nbeen better, but as the New York\nTimes described it, \u201ca relatively\nhigh-budget story of a group of\nragtag sailors who go searching for\na crew of evil pirates who have a\nplan for world domination. Also,\nmany of the characters in the\nmovie have sex with one another.\u201d\nThis film is described as having\nbeen made to appeal to women as\nwellasmen,andthisisevident.The\nfilm opens to a young, newlywed\nwoman, nervously stripping for\nher husband for the first time.\nThis is unexpectedly well-acted,\nand is initially realistic. However,\nthe sex rapidly became too porny,\nand I think the producers missed\na trick by skipping the niche\nappeal of a virginity\nscene, which women could have\nrelated to. What disappointed\nme most, watching this film as\na woman, was the ratio of male\nto female orgasms in each of\nthe erotic scenes. There were no\nfemale orgasms shown in any\nscene where a man was present,\nand in only one of the all-girl sex\nscenes (where it wasn\u2019t really clear,\nbut I\u2019ll give it). This inequality\nparticularly saddens me, because\nI find it thoroughly unnecessary.\nI don\u2019t think there is anyone\nwho is going to be turned on by\na pornographic (male and female)\nsex scene, who would be turned\noff by watching a female climax.\nI\u2019m sure that these world-famous\nactresses are perfectly capable of a\nmagnificently faked orgasm, and\ncertainly, there is time to include\nit in a film this long.\nEven with a million-dollar\nbudget, there\u2019s only so much\nmoney left for CGI, and we were\nleft wondering which of the sex or\nbattle scenes were more realistic.\nThey seemed, at times, to have\nplumped for quantity rather than\nquality, with a large number of\nbeautiful sweeping shots of what\ncould have been Play-Doh boat\nmodels. That said, the non-computer-generated scenes were,\non the whole, very well-composed\nand shot, with the exception of\na few rather oddly-placed light\nsources (and I\u2019m not talking\nabout the non-conventional use of\ncandlesticks in the final scene).\nThis is a critical analysis, and\nI am picking on the bad points\nof the film, but I should end by\nsaying that as far as pornographic\nfilms go, this was definitely of very\nhigh quality, and I would go as\nfar as to say that it preaches far\nfewer bad habits that most porn.\nThe media frequently reports\non how damaging it is for young\npeople to learn about sex from\npornography, a sentiment that I\nwould agree is true to an extent.\nHowever, with an immensely\npopular pornographic feature\nsuch as this moving towards a\nmore realistic portrayal of sex, I\nsee no reason to artificially shield\nthe next generation as ours never\nwas in the days before parental\ncontrols.\nA\nll this said, the best\njudge of porn has to\nbe its ability of inspire\ncarnal lust. And did it\nsucceed? Sadly, the\nonly se[a]men to be seen that night\nwere of the onscreen variety; Mr\nWu\u2019s puny gunshots were unable\nto arouse any other kind of shots\nthat night, something which no\namount of saltpetre could fix.\nPIRATES:\nA REVIEW\nWITH\nSCIENTISTS\nOne of Cosmo\u2019s top tips to \u201cspice up your sex life\u201d\nsuggests watching porn together.
