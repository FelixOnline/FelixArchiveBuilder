    "content": "BK Laughter\nAt\nCarthage.\nMichael Moor cock must be\none of the most influential\nSF writers of all time. As editor of the magazine\n'New Worlds' he helped\nestablish the so called 'New\nWave' which marked a definite reaction against\n'fantastic future' and 'bug\neyed monster' stories.\nMany currently well known authors owe their first\nbreak to Moor cock while\nhis own voluminous output\nhas helped greatly to\ndissolve the boundaries\nbetween what is and isn't SF. His latest book The\nLaughter of Carthage\nlanded on my desk at the\nend of last term but\nbecause it is a substantial\nread it has taken me until\nnow to review it.\nA single book is not\nsufficient to fully\nunderstand Moor cock's writing and so, as this is\nsomething of an advert for\nthe man's books, I shall\nramble on a bit. Many of\nhis books form parts of a series and in addition there\nare a number of themes\nand characters which run\nthroughout his work.\nHowever for complex reasons, books, chapters\nand events are not always\nin an order which could be\ndescribed in any way as\nchronological. Furthermore\ncharacters may often be\ncompletely different people\nfrom book to book. This applies particularly to the\nJerry Cornelius series of\nbooks which are perhaps\nhis most unconventional\nwritings. To describe\nMichael Moor cock's work\nas variable is something of\nan understatement and to\nfully catalogue it would be\na substantial job, but\namong the better titles The\nElric series and The\nOswald Bastable trilogy are\nworth reading.\nLaughter of Carthage is a relatively conventional\nnovel which with its\npredecessor Byzantium\nEndures forms part of an\non going series chronicling\none Colonel Pyat. The two\nbooks should really be read\nin order as Byzantium\nEndures contains a short\nintroduction which explains\nsomething of how the\ncharacter arose and the\nnature of his memoirs.\nPyat is born on the 1st January1900 in Kiev and is\nbrought up by his mother\nand bohemian friends in\nthe pre and post\nrevolutionary turmoil of\nSouthern Russia. His life\nand travels take him\nthrough a cross section of\nmodern history as he\nformulates fantastic\nschemes and revolutionary\ninventions whilst\ncontinually failing on the\nverge of greatness due to\nhis peculiar personal\nqualities. Laughter of\nCarthage picks up Pyat's story as he is fleeing\nOdessa in 1920 on a steamer round the Black\nSea and then across\nEurope and America up\nuntil 1924.\nPyat is a compelling character whose story\nseems to be connected in\nsome allegorical manner to\nthe moral history of\ntwentieth century\ncivilisation. He becomes involved with many\nimportant movements and\ntechnological innovations\nwhilst never achieving the\nfame he believes he\ndeserves. Pyat is a genius,\na liar, an addict, an egotist,\na racist and a bigot who\nengenders fascination\nrather than sympathy. He is\nalso a survivor and a visionary. Pyat's dreams\nand his view of world\nhistory as a battle between\nthe mythological influence\nof Byzantium and Carthage seem in some way to be an\nattempt to explore the way\nsocieties are drawn to\nlogically ridiculous\nphilosophies such as\nfascism. On another level\nentirely, both Pyat and the\ncharacter of Mrs Cornelius,\nwho appears regularly, will\nbe familiar to anyone who has read the Jerry\nCornelius books.\nSeemingly yet another\nMoor cock cryptic\nconnection. Laughter of Carthage is\npublished by Flamingo and\ncosts \u00a34.50 in paperback\nwhich seems a lot for a paperback to me, but then\nagain book prices generally\nseem extortionate these\ndays.\n'I mean, if I was up there\nacting out, I would be\nclass if i ably insane. There is\na big difference between\nacting and acting out.\nActing out is some guy\nshowing his genitals to\nwicked old ladies in Hyde\nPark, and I don't do that.'\nWilliam Hurt\nKiss of the Spider Woman\nApplications are invited for\nWARDEN\nSouthwell House\nFree flat provided\nApplications from IC Union\nOffice on a Standard\nApplication Form.

Indeed\nsome of their leaders' lack\nof experience in organising\nstrike action is almost\ncomical. The AUT, though, has decided that the\npresent government's lack\nof support for higher\neducation is so serious that\nthey should strike.\nStudents have suffered\nappa ling cuts in real terms\nin grants and benefits.\nImperial College students\nhave never really taken part\nin protests about the\npresent cuts.

Recently the\ngovernment announced cuts in Housing Benefit and\na2% rise in student grants.\nIt is about time that\napathetic IC students got\noff their arse s and\nprotested. Why not write a letter to your MP or lobby\nhim/her. As a start why not\nsupport the AUT strike and\nboycott lectures. If your\nlecturers are prepared to\nprotest about lack of\nfunding for your education,\nsurely you should join their\nprotest.\nHon Porn Night\nThe decision by the R SMU Rugby Club to hold the\nHonorary Pornographer's Night shows them to be\namazingly naive. In this\nissue of FELIX J Martin\nTaylor, ICU Academic Affairs Officer and\nChristine Taig,\"Women's Officer both write about the\nneed for Imperial College to attract more women. Unfortunately both of them\nfailed to mention Hon Pom' s Night. Hon Pom' s Night is the sort of event\nthat gives IC it's reputation\nfor being sexist. Until we\nlose this reputation we will\nhave problems attracting\nwomen to IC. We must try\nto attract more women, then maybe we wouldn't need to ga wp at them on a film screen.\nFELIX\nIt's the new year so why\nnot take up a new interest.\nCome and work on FELIX.\nFind out what it involves by\ncoming in next Tuesday at\n6pm or Wednesday at\n12.30pm.

If you have an questions\ncontact Lesley in Student Services.\nAnyone who has submitted\na claim for benefit over the\nlast year (1985) should read\nthe relevant section of this\narticle.\nIf you are experiencing\ndifficulties with any\nbenefits, please call into\nStudent Services and see\nLesley, the Welfare Adviser.\n1. Unemployment benefit\nAnyone who read the\narticle at the end of last\nterm in FELIX and\nsubmitted a claim for\nUnemployment benefit in\nthe Christmas vacation will\nhave realised that trying to\nclaim this particular benefit\ncould, and probably did,\nprove difficult due to\neligibility rules. As long as\nyou had paid enough National Insurance\ncontributions in the\nrelevant tax year(s) you\nshould have had no trouble\nin submitting a claim. If\nyou applied and have\nreceived a giro \u2014 well\ndone! If you have not\nheard, or have been\ndisallowed, call into\nStudent Services and let us\ncheck for you. Decisions have been wrong in the\npast and appeals have been\nsuccessful. Immediate\naction is required as only a limited amount of time is\nallowed in which to make a claim. Please bring\nevidence of your claim and\nany correspondence with\nthe Unemployment Benefit\nOffice.\n2. Housing benefit\n(vacation)\nIt is probably too early to\nworry if you have not heard\nabout your Christmas vacation claim but if you\nhave heard nothing by the\nbeginning of February, call\ninto the Student Services\nOffice. The\" chasing up\"\nprocedure can then begin.\nIf you are claiming from\nHammersmith and Fulham and have already submitted\na claim for term-time and\ndid not receive form HB8 from the benefit office, call\ninto Student Services to get\none. It must be submitted\nimmediately, otherwise\nyour Housing Benefit will\nnot be reassessed and you\nwill not receive any extra\nmoney for this vacation.\n3. Housing benefit (term-time)\nMost people will have\nreceived an assessment. If\nyou haven't or you think\nyou have been wrongly\nassessed, check. Write to\nthe Housing Benefit Office\nrequesting a breakdown of\nthe assessment. Without\nthis, nothing can be\nchecked. If you disagree\nwith the breakdown or\nthink that you have been\nforgotten, call into the\nStudent Services office and\nwe will phone for you.\n4. Housing benefit (pre-1985-86)\nAnyone still waiting to\nreceive money or\nassessment for last\nacademic year, particularly\nfrom Westminster Housing Benefit Office, should contact Student Services\nimmediately. It is still\npossible to appeal\nespecially in the light of\nrecent decision concerning one student's claim, in\nwhich the Housing Benefit\nOffice insisted that his file\nhad lapsed due to the\nlength of time his claim had\nbeen outstanding,\neventually his file was reopened and reassessed! If\nyou think you may have\nbeen forgotten and you\nmade a claim over six\nmonths ago, call in. We\nneed to act asap.\nSupplementary benefit and\nCertified Housing Benefit\nStudents who stayed in\nLondon over the Christmas vacation and claimed\nsupplementary benefit and\ncertificated housing benefit\n- how did you get on? Of\nparticular interest to\nStudent Services are claims\nsubmitted by students\nresiding in Halls or Houses over the vacation.\nThe government's white\npaper on the social security\nreview makes it very clear\nthat the government is\ndetermined to prevent\nstudents claiming\nsupplementary benefit and unemployment benefit in\nthe short vacations and\nhousing benefit if living in\ncollege halls of residence.\nWe need to know how\nmany people were\nsuccessful in these claims\nso we can see how many\nstudents are really going to\nbe affected by the change in the regulations. These\nnew regulations should be\nimplemented by September\n1986.\nIf you are having\ndifficulties with benefits of\nany kind or would like\nmore information on what\nyou are eligible to claim\nfor, at present, see Lesley\nin the Student Services\nOffice.\n2 Friday 11 January FELIX\n\n"

The Society of Freemasons has\nmany members holding\ninfluential jobs in College, though no-one suspected how low the organisation\nhad sunk in its search for\nnew members until now. It\nis believed that Mr\nKingston has suddenly been offered the\nchairmanship of Nurk and\nDingbat, a directorship with\nUnited Sprockets, and a seat in Parliament. However\nMr Kingston denied that\nbeing a mason had\nanything to with gaining\nthese posts, claiming\ninstead that they were\noffered on the strength of\nhis abilities.\nIt was realised that Mr Kingston had become a mason at a meeting of the\nBoard of Academic Studies\n( BOAS) on Tuesday.

    "content": "You might have imagined\nthat, being a students'\nunion, IC Union would have policy on academic affairs However, you would be wrong. Human rights in\nChile may be well covered,\nbut the Union doesn't have\na view on teaching\nstandards, examinations,\ncourse content, etc.\nHopefully this situation will\nbe put to rights at next\nTuesday's Union General Meeting. Of course the full\ntext of the proposed new\npolicy will be circulated in\n'Exec News', but in\nanticipation that this might\nnot be too widely read, I am summa rising the main\npoints in this article.\nTeaching Standards\nThe main points of the\nproposed policy are that\nlecturers should receive\nsome training in how to\npresent lectures in an\ninteresting and coherent\nmanner, and that teaching\nperformance should be\nseen as an important factor\nfor lecturer promotion. It\nalso calls for the 'associate\nlecturer scheme' used by\nthe Physics department,\nwhereby two or more\nlecturers collaborate on\neach lecture course rather\nthan leaving it to just one person, to be extended as\nwidely as possible.\nAcademic Affairs\nOfficer\nCourse Content and Design\nIn theory, most students\nare allowed to do some Humanities options as part\nof their course. However,\nthere are often obstacles\nplaced in the way of doing\nthem, such as timetable\nclashes. Also, the marks\ngiven for such courses are\noften unrealistically low\ngiven the amount of work\ninvolved. There should be a realistic provision for\nhuman ites options in all\ncourses, and the proposed new policy is pressing for\nthis.\nThe introduction of the\nMEng degree is the most\nimportant new development\nsince four year courses\nstarted. Its introduction is\nto be welcomed, even if it\nis rather belated. But the\nCollege still has much more to do before four year\ncourses get the recognition\nfrom industry that they\nwere intended to have.\nExaminations\nThe proposed policy calls\nfor all courses to offer\nSeptember re-sits or\nsupplementary asses ment, at least for those who fail in\nthe first year. A large\nJ Martin Taylor\nnumber of students who\npresently have to have a year off would then be able\nto carry on into their\nsecond year. In\ndepartments where re-sits\nare held the failure rate is\nnot ica bly lower.\nWomen Students\nThere are two problems\nwhen it comes to\nrecruitment of a higher\nnumber of women students\nto IC. First, more effort\nmust be made in schools to\nensure that girls are not\ndiscouraged from studying\nscience subjects,\nparticularly at the age of\nthirteen or fourteen when\nthey make their choice of\nO level subjects. The new\npolicy will press for action\nby the College, along with\nother universities, to\nimprove school lias on at\nthis level.\nSecond, this College needs to improve its image\nso that it can attract a high\nproportion of those women who do apply for science and engineering courses.\nThis is as much a Union problem as one for the\nCollege authorities, indeed\nit is a problem which\ndeserves consideration by\nall staff and students\nhere\u2014we can all do our\npart to improve IC's image\nin this respect, and the\nproposed new policy\nrecognises this.\nSo What?\nI feel that as students we\nshould be putting forward\nideas about how university\neducation can be improved.\nIn the past those that have\nbeen advanced to College by\nAcademic Affairs Officers\nhave been those that\nappealed to them personally,\nrather than a Union view.\nHopefully by having Union policy on the subject our\nviews will have more weight.\nAt least I hope it will lead a few more students to think\nabout academic affairs, and\nif you disagree with parts of\nthe proposed policy or you\nhave other ideas that you\nthink should be included\nthen come along to the U GM and let us hear your views.\nJ Martin Taylor\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nWomen's Officer\nAt the end of last term I was co-opted on to the IC\nUnion Council to act as\nTemporary Women's Officer. What, you may ask,\ndoes a 'Women's Officer'\ndo, and why am I doing the\njob?\nEveryone at IC Must be\naware of the very low\npercentage of female\nstudents here\u2014this causes\nmany problems for some of\nthe women here and almost\nall of us would like to see\nthe situation change. There\nare many people at College who feel isolated, lonely,\nintimidated, angry, or just\nbored with the social\nat mop here fostered by the\nunequal balance of the\nsexes. This isn't to say that\nplenty of people don't fully\nenjoy their IC social life,\nbut most would agree that\nmore women around the\nplace would be a good thing. This is never going\nto happen as long as IC\nkeeps its terrible image and\nits unbalanced atmosphere\nwhich a significant number\nof women( and men) find\nChristine Taig\ntotally off-putting. Many post-graduate women, especially, are a palled at\nthe contrast between IC\nand their previous college.\nThere are ways in which the union can improve the\natmosphere here; by\nintroducing a positive non sexist policy to rid college\nof material which most\nwomen and many men find\noffensive, whether it be\narticles in union\npublications, posters or rag\nmags, by following up,\nquickly and effectively,\nindividual women's complaints of sexual\nharassment by staff or\nstudents; by making it clear\nthat if more women are to\ncome to IC, attitudes within\nthe union will have to\nchange to make the place\nless hostile towards them.\nThe Women's Officer can\nnot be expected to do this\nsingle-handedly; she will\nnot be there so that all\nwomen's problems can be\ndumped into her lap; but\nshe will be able to remind\nand persuade other council and executive members to\ntake action when\nnecessary. She will be\navailable for individual\nwomen to discuss\nparticular problems and\nhopefully will follow these\nup and give advice as\nappropriate, she will\norganise schemes such as\nthe distribution of rape\nalarms, self defence classes\nand so on. She should also\nwork in conjuction with the\ncollege senior women's tutor and the student\ncounsellor.\nMost importantly the\nWomen's Officer will\nrepresent all female IC\nstudents, the post being\nsimilar to that of the post-grad rep. This doesn't mean only representing the\n'active feminists' or WIST\nmembers at college! I shall\nbe contacting all women students soon (no mean\ntask\u2014the percentage may\nbe small but that's still a lot\nof people \u2014 so this may take\nsome time!) but in the\nmean time if anyone has\ncomments, criticisms,\nquestions or ideas as to\nwhat the Women's Officer\nshould be doing please\ncontact me via the Union Office\u2014leave a note or use\nthe intercom as I'm in the\nbuilding most lunch times.\nAs to why I'm doing the\njob at the moment at the\nlast U GM, it was decided\nthat the post of Women's Officer should be created,\nand that she should be\nelected by all female\nstudents and have full\nspeaking and voting rights\non Council, the body which\nmakes most of the decision\non Union policy. However,\nbecause of the Union cons it it u it on this post won't be official until it has been\na proved at two\ncons ecu tia v eUG Ms. Until\nthis happens the executive\nand council thought it\nsufficiently important to ask\nsomebody to start doing\nthe groundwork for the\npermanent post. Having\nbeen at the UG MI volunteered to do the job\nand as nobody objected\ntoo strongly, here I am.\n12 Friday 11 January FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Phew, What\nA Scorcher\nThe full extent of plans for the Union Building were revealed in a document\nwhich came into the possession of FEELSICK earlier this week. The document,\na memo prepared by John Smith for the College Secretary's Planning Group,\nwas accidentally mailed to Student Services by Mr Smith's bungling minion\nMichael Arthur. From there it was passed to our reporter by Union Spy, Dave\nParry. Both sources asked not to be named, but because we like to think we\nare going to work for the Guardian, we shopped them.\nIn the memo Mr Smith outlines radical proposals for\ncreating more space in the\nUnion Building. He intends that\nthe Union should move all its\nfacilities to the space left at\nHarlington after the gravel has\nbeen excavated there. The Union will be taking up\nresidence in several houseboats and an old barge in the lake\nformed by the gravel\nexcavations. To compensate for\nthe loss of all but one of its\nsports pitches, College will buy\nthe Union a large number of\ntable tennis tables and intends\nto resurface the Queens Lawn with Astroturf. In the estimated\nthree year interim period\nbetween now and the\ncompletion of landscape\ngardening at Harlington the\nUnion is to be temporarily\nhoused in the nuclear reactor at\nSil wood. Production of\nFEEL SICK will be contracted\nout to Eddie Shah' sprint works at Wapping. It is thought that,\nlike Mr Shah's paper, FEEL SICK will not be printed in colour.\nThe large amount of space released is to be used by Nirex,\nwho are currently looking at\nproposals for sites to store\nmedium and high level\nradioactive waste. A spokesman that at the four other sites they\nhad encountered strong local\nobjections, but the College administration had been very\nreceptive to their proposals. It is\nbelieved that Beit Hall will not\nhave lead shielding installed,\nbut will instead be incorporated\ninto the Biology Animal House, for study of the long-term\neffects of radiation on students.\nUse of the radioactive material\nwill also cut drastically the fuel\nbills for the Beit Building.\nConcessions were made by\nCollege to the Union in the\ncourse of negotiations. Free\ncolo s to my bags are to be made\navailable to students from the\nUnion Bar to aid incontinence\nproblems in sabbaticals. Also,\nplaces on Aeronautical\nEngineering courses will be\nmade available to those\nsabbaticals who wish to run for\nUL U Presidency.\nCarl Burgess and Dave\nKingston said they were \"very\npleased with the deal\". ICU Council has been cancelled for\nthe next five years as Quentin Fontana felt that further\ndiscussions within the Union would prejudice the issue, and that the matter of the Union moving was \"too trivial to\nwarrant discussion at Council\". College Secretary, John Smith was unavailable for\ncomment on any of the above\nproposals, as he was busy\narranging the purchase of a yacht on which to retire to\nBarbados. The Rector, Eric Ash said that he had not been\ninformed of the matter by Mr Smith, and that Mr Burgess was\n\"too incoherent for anyone to\nunder t and what he was talking\nabout\" when they last met.\nOn behalf of the Union, Mr\nBurgess said,\"I feel this is a very advantageous move for the\nUnion. All I 've had in return is\nload of grief. Students really\npiss me off.\"\nFergie Denies All\nFergie has denied all\nknowledge of being\nengaged to Prince Andrew, in an exclusive revelation to\nFEEL SICK yesterday.\nFergie told FEEL SICK at a press conference at the tiny\nKensington flat, \" He never\nproposed to me. There's absolutely nothing between\nus. It's a complete\nfabrication.\"\nDespite Fergie's fervent\ndenials, intrepid FEEL SICK reporters waited patiently\nfor any signs of Royal\nmessengers to take Prince\nAndrew's regards to Fergie.\nHowever, after many hours\nof waiting outside Student\nServices in Prince's Gardens it was decided\nthat no-one was going to\nturn up. Don Ferguson is\nthought to be relieved that\nPrince Andrew has not\nproposed to him. Sarah Ferguson\n\n"

    "content": "Ennals Quits in Star\nWars Protest\nRichard Ennals, the\nResearch Manager of the\nComputing Department and\nlogic programming\ncoordinator for the Alvey\nprogramme, has resigned\nin protest at the SDI\nproject. Mr Ennals, a key\nfigure in the Alvey\nprogramme which is\nresearching into to the next\ngeneration of 'super\ncomputers', announced his\nresignation at the British\nComputer Society Debate\non SDI.\nMr Ennals is concerned that SDI will not be\nfe as able and fears that the\nGovernment will push for a greater military stake in\nAlvey, using the funding\nreview due in 1988 as\nle everage. He explained in\na Guardian interview that\n'the intention of all the\ndesigners has been to\nproduce powerful systems for civil use.'\nProfessor Bruce Sayers,\nhead of the Computing department, commented that the Alvey project's funding depended only on\n'how well the project was\ngoing' and that extra\nmoney would come from\nindustry if the governments\nfunding were reduced.\nMr Ennals is also\nconcerned that, following\nremarks made by Defence\nSecretary Micheal Heseltine\nduring Commons questioning, work on SDI\nwill take resources away\nfrom Alvey. Mr Heseltine,\nalthough 'enthusiastic'\nabout Alvey was unable to\nguarantee that SDI would\nnot divert resources from\nthe civil work on Alvey to\nmilitary work.\nColleagues have\ndescribed Mr Ennals\nresignation as a 'very brave\nmove'. Professor Sayers\nsaid that the resignation\nwould 'have no effect' on\nSDI or Alvey and added\nthat a new appointment\nhad already been arranged.\nHealey' Progressing' Andrew Healey, the\nchemistry student who was\nadmitted into hospital with\nThallium poisoning last\nterm, was reported to be\n'progressing' and 'in much better spirits' earlier this\nweek. Mr Healey has been\nin intensive care in Charing Cross Hospital since Friday\nNovember22. The Philip laboratory,\nwhere Mr Healey had been\nworking, has remained\nclosed since he was taken\nill. Police are still\ninvestigating the incident.\nProf Attacks Funding\nProfessor Sir Geoffrey\nWilkinson, head of the\nChemistry Department,\ncriticised the poor funding\nof research and teaching in\nBritain when he was\nfeatured in an Observer\narticle on December29. Professor Wilkinson, a Nobel Prize-winner, said\nthat funds were insufficient\nto train students in the\nnumbers required by\nindustry. He cited the\nChemistry Department at\nIC as an example; only\n\u00a3220,000 was left after\nsalaries had been deduct ec from the department's budget of \u00a31.2million. He\nwas also quoted as saying\nthat a ludicrous proportion\nof the country's basic\nscience budget was spent\non nuclear physics.\nProfessor Wilkinson\ndescribed the acute lack of\nfunds for research students\nas 'very worrying' when he\nspoke to FELIX on\nTuesday. He said that the\nsituation was particularly\nbad in chemistry, where\ncosts are high because of\nthe large consumption of\nmaterials, especially oil\nbased chemicals. At IC the\nchemistry department\naccounts for ar round50% of the College's expenditure on materials.\nIn addition the SER C provide only y3 of the cost\nto the department of each\nresearch student, a figure\nof around \u00a32000.\nProfessor Wilkinson\nconfirmed that there was\ntoo much emphasis on\nresearch into high energy\nnuclear physics. He said\nthat this work was not\nlikely to be of much commercial benefit, and\nadded that teaching core\nsciences should be a priority.\nIC Union General Meeting Tuesday\nl pm, Great Hall Union's Bar\nThe Union Bar opened under Union control for the\nfirst time last Friday. This follows several months of\nne go cia ting for the bar by\nUnion sabbaticals. Deputy\nPresident Dave Kingston\nsaid that trade in the bar\nseemed to be increasing.\nHe added that he was\npleased that a large\nnumber of Beit Hall\nresidents were using the\nbar.

    "content": "Ift\n\u2014reviews\u2014\nViolence is golden.\nThe problem with making a film centred around a racist\ncharacter is that it invites\nthe charge that the film\nitself is so, particularly\nwhen the direction, script\nand camera angles force\nthe audience to identify\nwith the character. In spite\nof these facts I don't believe that Michael Ci mino's new film Year of\nthe Dragon is\nfundamentally racist. The victims of the central\ncharacter's racism, the New York Chinese, are\nportrayed as varied and as\nhuman as any other group,\nand certainly not as a Fu\nManchu, or any other,\nstereotype.\nThe racist in question is\na New York policeman\nStanley White, played by\nMickey Rourke. White is\narrogant, selfish and\nobsessed, but for all these\nfaults he still proves to be\nsensitive and vulnerable.\nThis wide range of\nemotions and\ncharacteristics are superbly\nportrayed in one of the best\nperformances I have seen\nfor a long time. Rourke is\nan actor who always\nappears to be suppressing a violent rage behind a gentle smile, someone who\nmay explode at any\nmoment, and as such is\nwell suited to the role as\nStanley White.\nWhite is a Vietnam\nveteran brought in, as New York's most decorated cop,\nto control Chinatown after\nthe benign leader is\nusurped by a longer more\nambitious man. in this\nsuperior and friend tells\nhim.\nIt is a very emotive and\npowerful film p hot graphed position he sees himself\nfighting the war again, only\nthis time there is no jungle\nto hide in and this time he\nis going to win. He also\ncomes into conflict with his\nsuperiors who at first\nrefuse to believe that there\nis a problem, they don't want to make too much trouble; 'Life is about\ngetting along', White's with some impressive but\nnot intrusive camera movements. I could talk a great deal about this film\nbut space prevents me from saying much more other\nthan that this a film to see\nand think about.\nThe film world seems to be\nat a bit of a loss for major\nthemes: space, and disaster\nCABARET Who\nPlays\nWins.\nLaughter and fun seem to\nbe going out of fashion,\ngloom and despondency are becoming the rage, but\nnot at the Vaudeville. Here,\ntwo masters treat their\naudience to a true banquet\nof wit talent, melody and\nfun. Richard Stilgoe is not\njust a comedian, he is also\na lyricist and musician. The combination of these three\nskills makes him a show man of great appeal. Some of his songs are simply\nhilarious, some are very\nsharp, they are all topical.\nPeter Skellern by\ncomparison is the\npersonification of art. A gifted pianist and a songwriter of some note,\nhe gets the opportunity to\ndisplay his creativity on\none or two occasions without interruption from\nhis bearded, bouncy friend.\nThe two of them fill the\nshow perfectly. There is\nsuffice nt surprise in the\nrep e to ire to ensure that the\nwhole audience is wrapped\nin concentration and there\nis suffice nt humour to raise\na laugh a minute. Stilgoe\nand Skellern work well\ntogether, their timing is\nperfect and contains an\nelement that cannot be\nperfected by rehearsal.\nWhatever your education,\nyou will laugh at them.\nThey entertain the musical\nMaestro and the Social\nWorker alike\u2014see them if\nyou need cheering up.\nhave been covered, but\nrecently there has been a minor revival in the\nWestern, and the latest\nexample of this is the\nLawrence K as dan film\nSilverado. Some people\nhave expressed the belief\nthat this may well be the\nlast big Western, if that is\nso then it's a fine swan\nsong for the genre.\nAll the performances are\nexcellent but I particularly\nenjoyed Kevin Kline's easy\ngoing cowboy and Linda Hunt's shrewd saloon\nowner, both of whom have\nwonderfully infectious\nsmiles. I am tempted to say\nmore about the hat as an\nicon in the Western, but I'd probably lose my readers,\nso instead I 'll just say that\nthis is a real Yee ha film\nand I loved it.\nVery briefly, because I want to pass over this one\nas quickly as possible, and\nbecause it doesn't even\ndeserve the small amount\nof public ty that this review\nwill give it, Best Defence.\nThis film provides an\ninteresting comparison with\nLawrence Kasdan's because William Huy ck, the\ndirector and co-writer of\nBest Defence, wrote the\nweaker of the Star Wars\nand Indiana Jones series of\nscreen plays and K as dan wrote the better ones. Thus when both are given free\nreign on their own projects\nthe difference is\nunmissable.\nThis dreadful film also\nabuses the talents of two\nvery funny people, Dudley\nMoore as the defence\nresearch scientist and\nEddie Murphy as the tank\ndriver demonstrating the\nweapon at a Middle Eastern\nsales drive. Passing over\nthe suspect morals of the\ninvolvement that Murphy has in a war he stumbles\non to I would however like\nto mention that dreadful\nscript which is full of\nlabour ed double entendres\nand the sort of material that\nis about as funny as being\nrun over by a tank.

With typical\nmissionary diplomacy he\ndescribed the male half of\nthe couple who had\nprovoked his wrath as a 'playboy' and though\nallowing the couple to\nremain in their flat, he\nproclaimed indignantly that\nhe 'would not be there to\nlet them in in the evening'.\nSuch tolerance is perhaps\nthe best measure of this\nman's 'Christian Charity'.\nGraham Brown: College Conservative Looney\nDid you know, for\ninstance, that Nazi\nheadquarters seems to\nhave moved from the\nReichstag in Berlin, to\nSouthside in Imperial,\nGraham Brown, last years\nCons oc chairman and\nlooney (no, I didn't say the\ntwo were connected)\napparently runs his flat with\nthe same kind of humanity\nfor which Hitler was\nre known ed Not only does one get interrogated about\nthe purpose of one's visit,\nbefore being allowed into\nthe inner bunker, but it is\nrumoured that strongly\nAryan music is heard\nemanating from two inch\ngap round the door where\nthe interrogation occurs.

Student\nServices (an ungodly lot as\nwe shall see later) have\napparently allowed\nstudents to live in sin, (I'm sorry, but I had to say it) in\naccommodation intended\nfor married students.\nSpeaking of Christians,\nthat other well known Soldier of God Mr Roger Preece has been found to\nbe the source of a puzzling\narticle submitted\nanonymously for the last\nFELIX. It seems Mr Preece\nwas determined to preempt his appearance in\nBelow the Belt by writing\nthe story himself. A pity\nthen that our editor\nrejected the copy as\nlacking interest and set his\nstaff on researching the\nmatter more deeply.\nComplaints have been\nlevelled against Student\nServices finance assistant\nDave Parry. An dyBeck has\nbeen trying to accuse him\nof not telling him the\ncorrect cost of his rent was\nactually less than it was\nsupposed to be. Those in\nthe know however have\nfigured out by now that Mr\nBeck is doing nothing more\nthan carrying out a vendetta against Mr Parry.\nThis conclusion is justified\nby the fact that Mr Beck has claimed for housing benefit declaring that he\nwas paying the higher rent.\nAn dyBeck has been\nwriting letters to us (see\nletters page) accusing Mr Parry of a 'lack of\ncommunication and\ninterest'. Perhaps someone might like to tell Mr Beck that we're on to him. 'Nuff\nsaid.\nStudent Services seem to\nbe upsetting a lot of people\nlately. What about the\nfamous case of 'The\nsnubbed Ex-Officer'! Well\nthe man in question (who\nshall remain nameless but\nwhose initials are MA) was\nsent an invitation to\nStudent Services Christmas Party, but late enough to\navoid subjecting the\ngathered company of\nmerry-makers to his\npresence.

Maybe MA should try a new de do rant! Some news of our staff\nnow: Nigel Atkinson, FELIX' s slimming photographer, looks like he\nmay lose more than just\nweight if his present\nwoman has her way.

    "content": "Tea and coffee are the two\nmost popular hot drinks\nworld wide; so it seems surprising that while a great deal is known about\ntheir chemical composition, much less is known about\nthe processes involved in\nbrewing.\nDr M Spiro of the\nChemistry Department at\nImperial College has been\nlooking into the kinetics of\ntea and coffee infusion;\nthat is the rate at which water soluble constituents\nare extracted from the tea\nleaves or coffee particles\nduring brewing. Since some types of tea and coffee can contain as many\nas three hundred different\nchemicals, the research\nfocuses on the extraction\nof the more important\nconstituents such as\ncaffeine and the a flavin s,( which give tea it's red\ncolour). A series of\nexperiments have\ninvestigated the way factors\nWhat's Brewing\nFELIX investigates research being carried out in the\nChemistry Department of Imperial College into the\nhumble cup of tea.\nsuch as temperature, size\nof particles, pH, and stirring can influence this\nprocess.\nOne interesting result of\ntheir work is that the rate of\ninfusion does not increase\nwith stirring. Althougth this\nmight seem surprising, it is\nconsistent with traditional\nrecipes for tea making\nwhich suggest there should\nbe little or no stirring\nduring brewing. However,\none factor that does have a large influence on the\nprocess is the particle size,\nwith finely divided tea or\ncoffee having a greatly\nenhanced rate of infusion.\nThe rate is actually\ndependant on the inverse\nsquare of the radius of the\ncoffee particle, or the\ninverse square of the\nthickness of the tea leaf.\nOther experiments looking\nat the effect of varying pH show that-for some\ncomponents like the\na flavin s the rate is\ninfluenced, but for others\nsuch as caffeine it is not.\nThe research has been\nable to show that the rate-determining step for the\nbrewing process involves\ndiffusion of caffeine\nthrough the bean or leaf\ncoupled with diffusion of\nwater into the solid. In the\nfuture Dr Spiro hopes to\nuse a computer simulation\nstudy to gain a better\nunderstanding of this\nprocess.\nIn 1982 this work was\nfeatured as part of a Tomorrow's World\nprogramme, but as the date\nwas April 1 many viewers\nbelieved it to be a hoax. It\nwas however quite genuine!\nThe Brooke Bond and Ty P hoo tea companies who have provided sponsorship for this research obviously\nfeel that this type of\nobjective character is ation, when compared to the use\nof tea tasting panels, is\nimportant for their future\ndevelopments. They hope\nthat the production of a quality instant tea for\nvending machines or\ntransport catering will be\nmade possible.\nIn the food and drinks\nindustry ginger extracts art\nused to flavour a number c products including ginger\nbeer and ginger cake. At\npresent simple traditional\nextraction methods are\nused to prepare a soluble\nginger extract from ginger\nroot. Dr Spiro in\nconjunction with a large\nfirm is currently making a system study of possible\nnew solvents, and the\noptimal conditions of time\nand temperature required\nto produce the ginger\nextract. One of the solvents\nto be studied is\nsuper critical carbon dioxide. It is already used\nto produce decaffeinated\ncoffee, and is popular with\nmedical authorities who are\nconcerned about traces of\nsolvents that are at present\nfound in some foods.\nDr Spiro's work is\nproviding information\nwhich is of use to the food\nand drinks industry in the\nshort term.

Anyway\ngood luck to you as you prop\nup good old capitalist society,\nbless its cotton socks (\u00a32.99 at\nSparks & Mensa). The object\nof this is not to pontificate on\nwhat to buy \u2014 if you want a pair of diam ante shin pads\nthat's your problem and I 've\nnot got the faintest idea where\nyou'd get them. What I would\nlike to suggest is that you stock\nup on whatever you need for\nthe next couple of years in\ncase, as reported nationally\nthis week, the student grant is\nIli ill pl lB li_..,...M \u00bb \u00bb V.' if\ncut by \u00a31100 as a result of\nhousing benefit changes.\nIf while you're contemplating\nhow to save money by spending\npounds you feel like getting out\nto see something a little\ndifferent may I suggest some\ncircus. Circus Senso at the\nAlbany Empire until 18\nJanuary is in fact an updating\nof the circus idea incorporating\nalternative theatre and\ndispensing with the repugnant\nspectacle of performing\nanimals (eg ICU GM s). The\nnearest tube is New Cross and\nprices vary (with some special\nreductions). See Time Out for\nmore details.\nAnother multiple act which\nmight be worth seeing is The\nMagnificent Seven at the Man in the Moon theatre, 392 Kings\nRoad, on Monday 13 January.\nAs well as various mime and\nalternative entertainments this\nincludes Covent Garden street\nfestival winners The Vicious\nBoys. Cost is \u00a3 2 . 5 0 / \u00a3 J.50 \u2014\ncheaper than a film.\nBut if films are what you\nwant, two suggestions I'd have\nthe pomposity to make are\nDefence of the Realm at the\nOdeon Haymarket and Orion's belt at Cannon cinemas in\nChelsea or Tottenham Court\nRoad (these used to be the\nClassic cinemas). Both are\npolitical thrillers. Defence of\nthe Realm concerns a journalist\napparently stumbling on a parliamentary sex scandal\nwhich then leads to something\nnuclear. While Orion's Bell is a Norweigian story which starts\nwith some dubious goings on in\nthe arctic. Both these\nsuggestions stem partly from\nseeing the brilliant but\n\u2014 I occasionally OTT Edge of\nDarkness on BBC T, compelling\nstuff but is plutonium really\nlike that?!\nSuch is the appeal of\nsecrecy, or is it the danger of\nsecrecy? The field of official\nsecrecy is the subject of an\nevent at the Friends Meeting\nHouse, Euston Road on\nTuesday 14 January to be\naddressed by a mega-cast of\npublic figures including David\nSteel, Roy Hattersley, Ralph\nNader (who he, ed?) and Clive\nPonting. The Secret Rally is\npart of a Time Out-sponsored\nfreedom of information\ncampaign and it is suggested\ntickets are bought in advance.\nAnd lastly to plug some\nsuitable live music. Bastions of\nthe truly alternative scene Here\nand Now are currently playing\ntheir farewell tour. The date to\nremember is 31 January at\nDingwalls \u2014 should be a goodie! If a bit of psych a deli c revival is what turns you on\nman (as I believe they used to\nsay when I was tripping out on\nMarmite but ties before\nbedtime) then Zodiac\nMindwarp and the Love\nReaction are playing Alice in\nWonderlaijd at Gossips - Dean\nStreet on 13 January.

    "content": "AUT OUT\nThe Association of University\nTeachers (AUT) and the\nNational Association of Local\nGovernment Officers (NALGO)\nwill be holding a day of action\non January 15 which will take\nthe form of a national strike.\nThe AUT, which will be striking\nfor the first time in its history, is\ndissatisfied with the inadequate\nfunding of Higher Education: its\naction is intended to express\nthe strength of its members'\nfeelings on this issue. NAL GO members are striking in support\nof their flat rate \u00a314 per week\npay claim and against the 5.2%\nwhich they have been offered.\nThe AUT is calling on all\nmembers b allotted to withdraw\ntheir labour, and therefore not\ntake lectures next Wednesday. Pickets will be on duty, but will\nbe instructed not to try to\nobstruct entry to the College. Rather, they will try to persuade\nnon-striking colleagues of the\njustice of their cause. So as not\nto be disruptive, the AUT has\nalso informed the College of the\nstrike, allowing them to rearrange interview schedules. The Government has plans to\ncut the budget for universities\nby 2%pa over the next five\nyears. Professor Frank\nLeppington, President of\nIC AUT, has said that such a cut\nwould have serious\nconsequences for Higher\nEducation as the universities\ncould not maintain the quality\nof education without increasing,\nor at least static, university\nfunding. This, he said, was\nindicative of the way the\npresent Government\nundervalued education. He\nhoped that next week's strike\nmight persuade Tory ministers\nto ease financial restrictions.\nICU President Carl Burgess has expressed his support for\nthe AUT' s campaign. In a motion to be put to Tuesday's ICU GM, he will ask students to\nsupport the strike by not\nattending College on\nWednesday. He feels that in an\nissue which will directly affect\nthe education of future\nstudents, ICU has a duty to\nsupport the teachers action.\nNAL GO, which has members\nin the libraries, in Student\nServices, and in Sherfield, is\ndemonstrating against a pay\noffer which is 1.7% below the\nrate of inflation and 2.3% less\nthan the rise in average\nearnings. NAL GO members who are employed by universities\nearn considerably less than\ntheir counterparts working for\nprivate industry or in the civil\nservice. This is due to the\nlimited amount of money which the universities can afford to set\naside for their secretarial and administrative staffs. A member of IC NAL GO suggested that\nthe College's high staff turnover\nwas due to low pay levels.\nEmployees leave to higher\npaying jobs after an unusually\nshort time, forcing College to\nfind and train new staff who\nneed time to learn their jobs.\nUnless they were paid a wage\nwhich was in line with the work\nthat was being done, a static,\nexperienced staff could not be\nexpected.\nThe strike will have limited\nsupport from the other two\nProf Leppington\nmain campus unions, ASTM S and N UP E.AST MS has agreed\nnot to cross picket lines or to\nwork with any AUT or NAL GO section, while N UP E will be\nworking to rule on Wednesday. Is That All?\nStudent Grants are to be\nincreased by only two per cent\n(a \u00a342 increase on the London grant of \u00a32165) for the\nacademic year 1986/7.\nEducation Secretary, Sir Keith\nJoseph announced the changes in the House of Commons on\nDecember16. The Government is also preparing to withdraw\ncertain benefits which are\ncurrently available to students,\nalthough they may increase\ngrants by an additional \u00a336 to\ncompensate students for the\nlose of benefits. Students will\nnot be able to claim any\nunemployment or\nsupplementary benefit during\nthe short vacations. In addition,\nstudents who live in halls of\nresidence will be banned from\nclaiming housing benefit during\nterm-time. The Government is\nalso intending to curb claims\nfrom students living in private\nflats from next June. IC Welfare Adviser Lesley\nGillingham is particularly\nconcerned that students living\nin the College's head tenancies\nmay not be entitled to housing benefit. It is not clear whether\nthese residences w oui d be\nclassed as halls under the\nproposed regulations. If\nhousing benefit is withdrawn,\nthe flats in Lex ham Gardens, in\nparticular, will become too\nexpensive for most students.\nThe plans to reduce the\nbenefits payable to students\nwere outlined in a DHS S press\nstatement earlier this week.\nSome of the proposals are\ncovered in the government's white paper on social security.\nThe DHS S has also brought out\na consultative document which\ndeals with the projected\nchanges in housing benefit.\nWednesday's Guardian reported\nthat the Government intends to\nmake it illegal for students to\nclaim any benefit on flats or\nhouses which they are not\noccupying. FELIX contacted the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience on Wednesday and\nspoke to Press Officer, Richard Duckenfield. He said that the\nchanges will save around45% of the money spent on having\nbenefits paid to students.\nFree Friday 11 January No 725\n\n"

Whilst I appreciate that this is\nprobably due to the bunch of mindless hacks that you allow to use it most of the\nyear. I still think you could do something about it. Just\nlast week I was producing a paste-up in there and it\ntook me two days to find a pair of scissors. The dismal\nstate of some of the\nequipment is beginning to\nmake the C CU offices look\nexemplary \u2014 thses o called journalists are obviously a bunch of animals.\nFurther, it has come to\nmy attention that the so called Print Unit Manager,\nMr Hugh Soirthey, is\nneglecting his job. Contrary\nto the image he puts about\nof a hard-working\ninsomniac, he seems to\nspend all his time 'on the\npiss' with the Hockey Club. It seems Mr Southey is so dedicated to the 'lads' that\nhe seemed willing to risk\nrisk his valuable, and already broken, thumb at\nthe expense of spending Saturday rescuing his\nfailing newspaper. If things\ncarry on like this, I shall be\nobliged to steal the printing\npress and do the job\nmyself.\nYours,\nMark Cottle\nDear Hugh, Well the best one was when\nwe all fell asleep on the\ntube on the way back from\nthe Field Cup we were\nstanding on the Earl's Court platform and Corns went up to this guy and said 'fuck off, Shitface' it\nwas really funny we all\npissed ourselves and then\nhe got his plunk er out and pissed all over the live rail\nin front of these three old\nwomen I'm surprised he\ndidn't get zapped and then\nwe all chun de red up the\ncurry we'd had an hour\nago, it was really great and then...\nt tai iM Johnson\nDear FEEL SICK I was distressed to see there were no references to\nthe Bishop of Durham in\nlast week's sports page. I would have thought you might have mentioned his\nrefreshing views on the\nsubject of the 12 disciples,\nnamely that they obviously\nconstitute a soccer team\nplus substitute. He quoted\nrecently from the writings\nof St John the Divine and the Roman Sports Correspondent, Gre a vs icus on the subject of the\nCrucifixion. The Bishop has\nmade it clear that Jesus was crucified in the press\nafter the defeat of the team\nDynamo Bethlehem, of\n:which he was manager, by\nArimathea Athletic in the\nfinal of the Herod Trophy. Perhaps it was too much to\nhope for such enlightened\nviews to appear in your\nGodless magazine.\nRev KHI Rowe\nGodalming Chaplaincy\nDear Sir,\nIam writing to complain about the lack of God in\nrecent FEEL SICKS. I noticed that your story on the replacing the locks on the Tizard end of Southside with booby-trapped\ncombination devices that\nlet off clouds of mustard\ngas when tripped contained\nno reference to the great\nsacrifice made for humanity\nby our lord Jesus Christ\nwhen he died on the Cross. Locks are an important part\nof everyday life, and so it\nwas disconcerting not to\nfind any mention of prayer\nin the entire article or even\na quote from Genesis Ch14, v2.I feel that these\no mm is ions are\nunforgivable, because it is\nwell known that the only\npeople who count are\nChristians.

    "content": "Bot-Zoo\nDear Editor,\nThis term there has been\nmuch speculation\nconcerning the future of\nseveral Union rooms,\nincluding the Lounge and\nthe Bot Zoo Common Room. We would like to put\nthe record straight in\naccordance with\ninformation given to us by\nProfessor Anderson. The Bot Zoo Common Room has been allocated\nto the Department on\naccount of requirements for\nspace connected with new\nresearch contracts and\ngrants. The research space is to be used to create a new molecular/ immunology infectious disease unit to\nwork on problems of\nparasitic disease in\ndeveloping countries. The room known as the Lounge was to be allocated to the\nDepartment to be divided\ninto a seminar/ common room and a lecture theatre.\nThis now seems unlikely\nbut room(s) in the Union Building area are still under\nconsideration for use for\nthe Biology Department by\nthe College. As members of the\nDepartment and of the\nUnion we feel that any\nUnion room will be more\nused by students if part of\nit becomes a new. Bot Zoo Common Room than if it\nremains in its present use.\nWe apologise to those who work hard on the Lounge being the only party room\nin College. However, much space in the Union is\nwasted, especially on the\nfirst floor. The Bot Zoo is\nfairly unique in College, being a common room\nused by many staff and\nstudents, as well as people\nfrom around Beit Quad, and is essential to the\nundergraduate,\npostgraduate and staff\ncommunity of the\nDepartment. The queues in\nthe Bot Zoo twice a day\ntestify to this.\nMr Burgess's present\narguments are simply\nserving to delay a decision\nand mitigate against the\nundergraduates and\npostgraduates in the\nDepartment and College by\ncausing a break in service\nwhen the Bot Zoo closes in\nMarch. It seems unrealistic for\nMr Burgess to consider that\nthe Department will allow a room in which it intends to\ninvest cash, in order to\ncreate a civilised common room and lecture theatre,\nto be run by the Union in\nview of the general state of\nUnion rooms. The College can in the end act without\nUnion agreement. We would therefore suggest\nthat the best interest of the\ngreatest proportion of\nstudents would be served\nby a speedy agreement to\nconcede some use of the\nUnion as soon as possible,\nif not the Lounge. The interests of students are\nalso not being served by Mr\nBurgess misleading them\nby stating that they can prevent College doing\nanything in the Union Building.\nYours sincerely,\nTom Harper, Zoology 3 Year\nRep\nCharlotte Ford, Life Sci Div\nRep\nJob Withdrawal\nDear Sir,\nIn view of the recent\nannouncement that our\nGlenrothes facility is to be\nclosed early in 1986, it\nfollows that we will be\nwithdrawing from next\nyear's graduate recruitment\nprogramme.\nPlease arrange to bring\nthis to the attention of\npotential candidates by\nwhatever means is\nappropriate and withdraw\nour literature.

Recently, I received a further rent bill\nfor \u00a375 in addition to the\none I paid at the beginning\nof term. On approaching the Students Services\nOffice. I was told that this\nis due to my not being\ncharged for the Christmas vacation in my first bill.\nYesterday, I also rec eiv ced yet another bill, for \u00a3145,\nwhich, I am told, is for the\nChristmas vacation rent,\nplus an extra \u00a35 a week\nwhich the Student Services Finance Department\nneglected to charge me, as\nthey billed everybody for\nliving in a double room,\ninstead of finding out the\ntrue facts. Had they done\nso, they would have\nrealised that seventeen\npeople in Hamlet Gardens are living in single rooms.\nAlternatively, if it was\nnecessary to obtain the\nrent money as soon as\npossible after the start of\nterm, why could they not\nexplain the situation in a covering letter with the first\nbill? Then we could have\nbudgeted for this extra\nrent.\nOn informing student\nservices that I could not\npay this bill until after\nChristmas I was told that\nmy total bill in the first\nweek of next term would be\n\u00a3595 ie \u00a3450 for rent until\nthe end of the Easter term\nand \u00a3145 as outlined above.\nThis would leave me\napproximately \u00a3120 with\nwhich to survive the second term; it would have to cover\npurchase of tube pass\npayment of gas and\nelectricity bills, together\nwith essentials like food\netc.\nWhilst I do not object to\npaying the extra when I can afford it, I do object to the\ngeneral lack of\ncommunication, and , it\nappears interest by the\nStudent Services Finance Assistant. I ask student\nservices to ensure that\nerrors such as these cannot\noccur again and, also that\nwe are informed as to the\ntrue situation should this\nfarce be repeated.\nYours faithfully\nAL Beck\n)Nor\\d beaters Flights \u2022 Trains \u2022 Jours \u2022 Accommodation\nSki Holidays \u2022 ISIS Insurance \u2022 ISIC Cards\nGroup Rates \u2022 Weekend Breaks\nUL U Travel Imperial College, The Junior Common Room,\nSherfield Building, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7. 01-581 8882\nA Service of\nSTA\nTheWorldbeaters\nGOVERNMENT BONDED UNDER A TO L822N ASSOCIATION WITH SATA C CHARTER ERS FELIX Friday 11 January\n\n"

    "content": "Christmas Conundra Revealed.\nIn the Christmas Edition of FELIX, Megabrain and the Energise Spock Campaign presented six devious dilemmas for your delectation. The answers to five of them are presented below just to prove that they\ncan be done. There are two ways to check your solution to the\nword search. The first is to laboriously search for every word in the\ngrid below. This will probably take as much time as solving the\npuzzle. The second method is to read the unused letters from left to\nright and top to bottom. They should spell out a head-line from FELIX no 717 (18th October1985) \u2014 ' SCOOT FOR YOUR HOOT'. Solutions\nto the other non prize puzzles are also given with as much explanation as possible.\nWe have received several enter ies for the cryptic crossword and so\nthe correct answer is printed\nhere. The winner has been\nannounced in this weeks\nEditorial. Unfortunately, we have\nhad no solutions for the Electric\nnightmare. For once, we are\npuzzled! It really is easy (once\nyou know the answer) and\nrequires no complex algebra and\nvery little physics. We still have\nthe \u00a35 prize for this conundrum, so we will leave the com petit on open for one more week. As an\nextra clue, try to use symmetry in\nthe solution.\nThe3 cm measurement in this\npuzzle is a red herring. Simple geometry gives us a rule about\nthe diagonals of a rectangle\nbeing the same length. Well, a rectangle is marked in the\ndiagram below, one diagonal was\ngiven as 8cm, hence the other\none, which happens to be a radius, is also\n8 cm \u2014 Easy wasn't The trick here is to realise what the sentence\n(or sent ances) are about. This can be done simply, by reading the end of the\npassage:...had had had pleased the teacher.\nThe last four words make sense, they are a past tense verb 'had pleased' and an object\n'the teacher'. To complete the sentence, a subject is required. The beginning of the\npassage is a long way back, and there are no\nother nouns than those in the first three\nwords. So the subject can only be a quotation\u2014of a past tense of the verb to\nbe\u2014'had had' had pleased the teacher.\nThose of you that are awake wi\nTO4444444444+4444444444444+44444++4444444++4++4++4444+44 now realise X+4 that the passage is about some thing that Alan +4-4\nand William wrote or said, and one of them JJJ\nwrote, or said 'had had'. Punctuation of the ++4\nfirst three words can only be!\u2014William, wh i Alan \u2014Let us now assume that Alan had 4.4-4\nwritten 'had had', then the first sentence must\nbe\u2014William, while Alan had had 'had had', had+++\nhad 'had',. (Of course, Williiam could have ++*\nwritten 'had had'! ^.+^\n+ + 4\nThe complete solution is therefore either JJj\n1) William, while Alan had had 'had had', had ++4\nhad 'had'. 'Had had' had pleased the teacher.\n2) William, while Alan had had 'had', had +4-H had 'had had'. 'Had had' had pleased the ++^\nteacher. ++4\nDon't forget those capital letters! ++<\n4\n-4\n-4\n-4\n-4\n-4- + 4\n-4\n-4\n-4\n-+ + + 4- 4- + + 4- 4- + + 4- + + +4\n-4- 4\n-4\n-4- +4\n-4\n4- 4- 4- + 4- + 4- 4\n-4- 4\n-+ + 4- 4- 4- 4- 4- + 4- 4- 4- 4- 4- + + + 4- 4- 4- + 4- 4- 4- 4\n4\n-4- 4- 4- + 4- 4- 4- 4- 4- 4- 4- 4- + 4- + + + + + 4- 4r++44444++444J J\" fc J******************444'4*****4.4.^ fT Tft TTT TJ TY ff Y tX f \u2022\n8\nFirstly, look at it from Ann's point of view. Her last\nstatement indicates that she has narrowed it\ndown to two possibilities, one of which has a one\nas its second figure. There are 31 perfect squares\nfrom 13 ito 1300 which gives far too many\npossibilities, so it must be a perfect cube. The\nperfect cubes between 13 and 1300 are:\n27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000 of which 64\nand 729 are perfect squares. The answers to the\nfirst two questions must have left two of these. If\nit was less than 500 and a perfect square this\nwould leave just 64 so those weren't the answers\nAnn got. Less than 500 and not a perfect square\ngives three pos sib li ties and is also wrong.\nGreater that 500 and a perfect square leaves just\n729 and is wrong. Thus the answers Ann got\nmust have been: Greater than 500 and not a perfect square, which leaves 512 and 100. Since\nthese were both lies, the actual number is less\nthan 500 and a perfect square i.e.64. Thus there are 64 members of TT Soc in Bob's department.\nCO\nOL VIT This week we have a linguistic puzzle to keep you\nbusy. There are 9,864,100\npossible combinations of\nthese ten letters, not all of\nwhich are words in the\nEnglish language, but how\nmany are 7 You may only\nuse each letter once. The\nperson that hands in the\nmost words that can be\nfound in the Shorter Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary by 1.00\npm Monday will be handed a five pound note ( After they've been checked-so no\ncheating) ! By the way, there\nis at least one ten-letter\nword.\nThe picture shown below was not a puzzle. So all those of you who thought you solved it didn't \u2014ha.\nOpinion\nHon Porn's Night\nAt the end of last term, R SMU Rugby Club held their Hon Porn's Night. R SMU President,\nDave Pearce justifies the club's decisions to hold the event.\nThis is one of the more\ncontroversial issues in IC. I feel it is now time to reply\nto all those who condemned the R SMU for\nholding it.\nIt is a show which is\norganised by the RS M Rugby Club. It is held once a year and usually involves\ntwo female strippers and a number of pornographic\nfilms.\nIn my first year, 1983, 400\npeople attended-more than\nmost UG M's \u2014 due to the\ninterest caused by the\ncontroversy. In 1984, it was\nmoved to an alternative\nvenue due to certain\nopponents in IC failing to\ncancel it at the ballot box,\ninviting outside colleges to\npicket it and national press\nto report it. The Rector,\nthen Lord Flowers, asked\nthe R SMU President to\nmove it away from IC or\ncancel it, which he did.\nThis year it went ahead as\nit had always been\ntraditionally, quietly and\nwatched by members of the\nR SMU Rugby Club. Having explained the\nevent and its recent history,\nI will try and summarise the\nobjections. It is said to be\nsexist and degrading to\nwomen, because of their\nemployment in sex acts on\nscreen for a predominantly\nmale market.\nI agree that it is sexist, by\ndefinition, because it is\nmade for a predominantly,\nbut not wholly, male\nmarket. But that's not the\npoint. If manufacture of\nbras is sexists as it caters\nfor a solely female market.\nThe point is, is it degrading\nto women? Do the\naudie nge come away\nfeeling that women are for\nsex only? I feel not and for the\nfollowing reasons:\nFirstly the audience do\nnot watch it for sexual\npleasure\u2014that's difficult\nwith dozens of others\nwatching\u2014rather the thrill\ncomes from watching\nsomething socially taboo.\nSecondly, sex is a natural\nact. Humans find it\npleas u able, surely no\naccident of God. But at the\nsame time you know that\nthe feelings behind the sex\non the screen are just acted\nand not real.\nThirdly it is said to be\nimmoral, who decides these\nmorals? If the majority in\nsociety had decided them\nthen it would be illegal.\nAny natural act regarded as\nimmoral makes people feel\nguilty and suffer the\ndegradation and character\ndestruction that goes with\nit\u2014surely that is wrong? Fourthly, it is held but\nonce a year. This cannot\noverwhelm a mind with\nrep a cio us lust.\nFifthly, when I came away from such a night I didn't go and maltreat any\nwomen. I still have the\nrespect that I went into the\nevent with. Rather, I leave\nwith a broader mind having\nseen the event and made\nmy own mind up about it.\nRealise this too, we in the\nRS M, feel very strongly that\nwe decide what we do\n(within the law of course).\nWe're not animals or\nimbeciles \u2014 we need 'A' levels as well. In the next\nfew weeks there will be a questionnaire going round\nRS M asking Union member numerous questions\nincluding their view on Hon Porns.\nNoI don't think Hon Porns is degrading to\nwomen, but thank you for\nthe controversy that has\nmade me think, discuss and\nrealise this.\nDavid Pearce\nPresident\nRSMU.\nday 11 January\n\n"

He' s faced with a stiff task, to turn a floundering and damaged bar back to it's rightful place as a main social centre in College. There'sa lot at stake, especially financially, and since last Friday the money at risk is yours. In films Irishmen are\nusually portrayed as either\nloudmouth drunks or born\nentertainers. Moore Lyttle\ndefinitely fits most easily\ninto the latter category,\nthankfully he has the\nlandlord's knack of putting\nhis customers at ease and\nserving beer at the same\ntime, something sadly\nlacking in recent weeks.\nHe's not a stranger to\nImperial either having\nworked regularly in College bars for a few years\nculminating in 1981 with a six month spell as manager\nof Southside Bar.\nIronically he now finds\nhimself in direct\ncompetition with Southside which he readily admits is a larger and more\ncomfortable bar with the\ngreat advantage of a ready\nmade market. In\ncomparison the Union is\nsmall and fairly isolated\nand has lost many regular\ncustomers during the\nturmoil of last term. The Union Bar used to take\nmore money than\nSouthside but the\nSouthside bar has been\nextensively modernised\nover a period of years while\nthe Union has been treated\nmuch less favourably.\nPart of the unwillingness to\ninvest in the Union can be\nblamed on it's reputation as\na haven for heavy drinkers\nwhich in itself has lost\nmany customers. The bar\ndoes rely on the C CU bar\nnights, the drinking and\nsports clubs and after\ndinner drinkers to bring in\nmoney but Moore agrees\nthat it cannot survive on\nthese events alone. While\nacknowledging that the\nCollege has many 'active'\ndrinkers and that tradition\nis particularly important to\nthe bar he also feels there\nis a limit to the behaviour\nthat is acceptable and most\nclubs recognise this and\ncontrol their own members\nif they step out of line. He\nsees the Union as a noisy,\nlively bar which could\nnever have a lounge bar\natmosphere. However,\nthere is a second bar in the\nSnack Bar which will\ninitially open on\nWednesday lunchtime and\nevening and does offer\ngreater comfort and space.\nIt is hoped that this bar can\nbe expanded but the extra\nstaff required can only be\npaid if the bar takings\njustify it. STOIC are\ncurrently preparing to\ninstall a television in the\nLounge which will show\nvideos in the even in in gs and it is hoped a microwave oven can be\nreintroduced shortly to\nprovide hot food\nthroughout opening hours.\nThe changeover has been\nparticularly hectic in both\narranging to order supplies\nand in tidying up the bar\nand this has required a terrific amount of effort.\nMoore particularly thanked\nMartin Parsons and the\nrefectories staff for their\nhelp, particularly in\nemploying extra staff to get\nthe bar into shape, and also\nthe staff of all the other\nCollege bars for their help\nand advice. Moore is\nobviously fully committed\nto the job in hand but the\nchanges that need to be\nmade all require to be\njustified by money across the counter. Why not go for\na drink in the Union's Union Bar tonight?\n\"Why not\ndrink in\nthe\nUnion's Union\nBar\ntonight?\"\nIP\nUnion Bar Promotions\nGuinness 60p Boddingtons 70p FELIX Friday 11 January\n\n"
