    "content": "Xtra Curricular\nAnother week of temptation\nKeys: Harry Hill, Carnival\nSo, here we go again, another week, another\nset of choices - should I revise or should I sunbathe or watch \" Going for Gold\"? I remember (vaguely) what it was like. But I'm afraid we're about to put more temptation in\nfront of you (as if you needed it). So, for those\nof you luckily enough to have finished your\nexams, or if you're just seeking a well\ndeserved break - here's where it's at.\nFriday May 12th: A bit of a coup this\none, and definitely worth taking a night off\nfor. I.C.U Ents is proud, and very excited, to\npresent one of stand-up's soon to be\nmega stars, Harry Hill. This is an exclusive\nshow, prior to Harry shooting his live video\nin the West End and we guarantee it will be\nyour last opportunity to see this act in such\nan intimate venue. So, if you want to catch\nthe winner of the 1994 \"Independent on\nSunday\", \" Time Out\" and \"City Limits\" Comic of the year awards, and the star o'f Harry Hill's \"Fruit Fancies\", then the doors\nopen at 7.30pm prompt. It's just \u00a32 a ticket -providing that \"Bust a Gut Comedy\" really\ndoes bring you the best value for money in\nthe capital. Please note admission is strictly\nlimited for this event, and will be allocated\non a first come basis, so don't be late. Also\nwe've been asked to point out that this event\nis strictly students, staff and guests only.\nAnd if that wasn't enough fun for a night, we're also giving you the chance to\nindulge in a little ELIXIR, to refresh your\ntired minds. From 10 'til 2 free yourself to the\npumping House and Garage sounds as we\ngive the Ents Lounge over to the coolest cuts\nin club land.( If that doesn't sound too much\nlike one of those terrible Dance Zone TV ads). Admission is \u00a31 after 9pm, or FREE before or have been to the comedy.\nMonday May 15th: Chill out in the Quad\nwhile taking advantage of our weekly \u00a31 a pint offer on a chosen product. Bar opens at\n5pm and it's strictly a 'while stocks last'\nscenario.\nWednesday May17 th: A very slight\nchange to the format for Club Spanquesince most of you are either revising or just\nenjoying your evening in the Quad, the disco\nwill now be ending at 11.30pm and the Quad\nwill be cleared by 11.45pm. Thursday 18th: Ideal for those balmy\nsummer nights (there's a song in there\nsomewhere) - grab yourself one of our exotic\nCOCKTAILS and imagine yourself on a beach. The most sophisticated way to spend a night.\nFriday May 19th: Another chance to\nwitness the success of \"Bust a Gut\" as one of\nthe country's top student comedy venues, as\nit stages a prestigious London heat of the\nNational Comedy Network Open Mic Awards. This acts as a showcase for some of\nthe best, as yet, undiscovered comic talent in\nLondon. The show features five acts and is\ncomp ered by one of the currents stars of the\ncircuit, Boothby Graffoe. Entry is \u00a32, doors\nopen at 8.30pm, the show starts at 9pm prompt and there's a FREE bottle of\nNewcastle Brown Ale to the first fifty in.\nAgain, if you just want to dance and drink the\nnight away there'll be a disco 'til 2am with a lam bar. \u00a31 after 9pm. So, there you have it, another week of\ndubious pleasures. But that's only the start of\nit... Here are some more edited highlights for\nthe rest of the term.\nFriday May26 th: Leave your pretensions at home, and put on your sling\nbacked dancing shoes, as we give ourselves\nover to a night of classic pop and disco\nsounds at \" SHAFT\". So, if you long for the\nchance to dress up and dig the sounds of\nanyone from ABBA to Yazoo, or Duran\nDuran to Wham! then this is the night for\nyou. There' ll be ABBA and Muriel' s Wedding prizes for the funkiest threads, and\nas usual it's only \u00a31 in.\nFriday June 2nd: Now for a bit of a change and just to prove we do listen\noccasionally, a chance to try out I.C.U POP\nTARTS. A night with less of an emphasis on\ndance music, and more on that much\nneglected pop and indie tip. So, if you think\nwe've ignored guitar pop and 'student\nclassics' for too long, then tonight is just the\nnight to stomp around!\nFriday June 16th: Just in case you'd forgotten - this is the date for Midsummer\nNight's Carnival. Tickets have started to sell\nfast and are only available from the Union\nOffice in Beit Quad. As well as all the goodies\nadvertised already, we can now confirm the\nline-up in Whirl-y Gig as: DJ Monkey Pilot,\nJoi and Earthribe. We're also in the process of\nconfirming support of a barbecue to add to\nthe fun in the Quad. This is going to be the\nhighlight of the Ents. year the best \u00a35 any of\nyou spend, so don't miss out.\nI hope you all agree that we've got a decent end to the year planned, but we're\nalready looking forward to next year here in\nthe Ents Office, so if you feel like getting\ninvolved, and making your opinions known\nthen why not come and see me anytime, or\nattend our weekly Ents Meetings at 1pm on a Tuesday - everyone is welcome.\nEM FELIX icings\n\n"

    "content": "News\nNews in\nBrief\nBY RACHEL WALTERS Rector Disagrees\nWednesday's Board of Studies\nmeeting saw the Rector, Sir\nRonald Ox burgh, deliver his\nemphatic response to the New\nAcademic Framework, proposed\nfor University of London ( UL) degrees. His reply, which emphasises the difference in standard between Imperial's degrees and those awarded by\nother UL Colleges, was accepted\nwithout complaint by the Board.\nThe New Academic Framework, a paper by Professor\nAndrew Rutherford, Vice Chancellor of the University of\nLondon, calls for standards to be\nset across UL so that the quality\nof the degrees given by its\ndifferent Colleges would be\nuniform. In what amounts to an\nimportant statement of university policy, he says that there is a BY ANDREW SMITH \u00a320million from the Higher Education Funding Council of\nEngland ( HE FCE) has been\npromised to Imperial College for\nthe construction of the new Basic\nMedical Sciences building. The\nfuture of the project depends on\nan impending decision by the\nDepartment of Health (DoH) as\nto whether it wishes to give\nanother \u00a320m to the scheme. The\nundertaking will see up to five\nmedical institutions merging to\nform a new Imperial College\nMedical School.\nMystery surrounds the\nannouncement of the HE FCE money as the body itself has still\nnot formally declared their\nfunding of the project. It was\nVirginia Bottomley, the embattled Secretary of State for\nHealth, who announced the\nfunding in a Press Statement\nwhich also covers the proposed\nclosure of a number of London\nHospitals.\nHE FCE have insisted that\nneed for better communication\nand the demonstration of the\n'collective aims and objectives' of\nthe different colleges.\nSomewhat isolated amongst\nhis UL colleagues, Sir Ronald\nresponded that \"parity of degree\nstandards between universities in\nthe United Kingdom is a chimera\n... and the same arguments apply\nwithin the largest university in\nthe United Kingdom, which\ncontains institutions disparate in\nsize and mission.\"\nStudent Penury\nThe numbers of students using\nthe ICU advice service has gone\nup in recent weeks, highlighting\nfears that increasing numbers of\nImperial students are suffering\nacute financial hardship.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Don Adlington, IC's student advisor,\nsaid that \"over the past few years\nthe financial problem has got\nsystematically worse.\" He commented that money worries were\nan important part of student life,\nand that he was seeing very\ncareful students being unable to\nsurvive on their grants.\nthey themselves have not\nofficially announced their\nfunding, emphasising that a formal statement on the overall\nfinance will not be made until\nthe DoH decides whether to\ncontribute its \u00a320m to the\nproposed merger.\nSpeaking to FELIX Anna\nWhelan, Imperial College's Planning Officer, attempted to\ndownplay suggestions that the\nmoney is in the pipeline. She too\nemphasised that the HE FCE funding depends on it being\nmatched by the DoH but added\nthat \"we all hope very much that\nit will go ahead.\" It is still not\nclear when a final decision will\nbe made but the College's Planning Department, which has\ncoordinated applications, is\nexpecting it 'any day'.\nFELIX understands that\nthe Rector, who previously\nworked closely with Tory leaders\nas Chief Scientific Adviser to the\nGovernment, is confident that all\nthe money will come through. It\nappears though that the the\nCheaters Stay at Home\nThe University of London Academic Committee, meeting\non May 1, decided that students\ncaught cheating in University of\nLondon exams, which include all\nthose Imperial College students\ntake, will be dealt with by each\nUL College internally. The closely run ballot of the cross-section of students and academics\nfrom the various UL Colleges\nwho attended the committee\nmeeting saw the motion being\npassed by the slender majority of\nonly 21 votes to 17.\nToo Many Students...\nImperial College has indicated\nthat Constituent College Union\nfresher s who normally have their\nget-together s during the first\nweek in the Great Hall will no\nlonger be able to use this venue.\nThere are now too many students\nentering first year to fit in the\nroom for the welcome initiations.\nInstead fresher s will have to trek\nalong Exhibition Road to the\nKensington Gore corner to meet\nin the Royal Geographical\nSociety.\nproject may be put in jeopardy by\nthe Department of Health's wish\nthat it be tested under its new\nPrivate Finance Initiative. The\nresultant delay that this would\nincur worries those planning the\nmergers, with Ms Whelan admitting that her department\ndefinitely did not want the\nbuilding to come under the new\ninitiative.\nAnother problem looming is\nthat of the proposed demolition\nof the Royal College of Science II\nbuilding which is expected to\ntake place over the Summer.\nWith this 19th Century building\nin a 'conservation area', certain\nsources have suggested that local\nauthorities may find their\nnostalgic admiration of the\nancient lecture theatres becomes\nan overwhelming obstacle to\ndemolition.\nThe gutting of the theatres is\nplanned to occur soon after\nstudents leave at the end of this\nterm with demolition projected,\nbarring complications, for\nSeptember.\n(NUS continues from page one)\ndid leave the option of objecting\nlater open, saying 'maybe I will',\nbut stressed that \"the people\nrunning the referendum should\nbe doing something about it.\"\nThe competency of the ICU Executive's running of the\nreferendum is crucial to the\nlegitimacy of the ballot. If the\nnext ICU Council meeting on\nthe 23rd May decides that their\nhandling of the issue has not\nbeen acceptable, the whole\nexercise will be discounted. Ms Thomas refused to disclose her\nopinions of Exec's management\nof the referendum, saying that\nshe would take any objections to\nthem, rather than commenting\nto FELIX. While it had been suspected\nthat turnout might not reach the\nrequired one thousand votes, it\nnow appears that the four days of\nballoting across campus could\nmean that sufficient numbers of\nstudents will vote for the count\nto be quo rate. As FELIX went\nto press, after two days' voting,\ninsiders estimated that between\nsix and seven hundred votes had\nbeen cast. If another four\nhundred students express their\nopinions before 7.00pm today a legitimate decision will have\nbeen made.\nIt is still not clear whether\nClaire Maloney, St Mary's Student Union President, will\nencourage medical students to\nvote. Guidance by St Mary's Student Union in the recent\nsabbatical elections resulted in over two hundred extra medical\nvotes for the preferred\ncandidates. Clearly this could\nhave a significant impact on the\nNUS referendum, but, with Ms Maloney said to be annoyed that\nPaddington students were not\nmailed the information given to\nSouth Kensington students, it is\npossible that very few votes will\ncome from the northern part of\nthe campus.\nIt has also emerged that last\nFriday's Referendum Hustings\nwere even more confused than\nfirst thought. Jim Murphy, recently re-elected for a second\nyear as NUS President, arrived\nlate expecting to speak on behalf\nof the pro-lobby. ICU and the\nNUS are still at odds as to why\nthe delegation was late with both\nparties blaming each other.\nFunds Promised (Perhaps?)\nFELIX I2HIRV95\n\n"

Easter Trip to Shropshire\nKeys: Ridge, Wave, Bungee\nAs Easter approached this year the gliding\nclub decided to re-visit the venue of last\nyear's escape - Long My nd Airfield, Shropshire. For club members used to the\nflat site at Lasham the Long Mynd counts as\na fair hill and reports of the previous years\nconditions sounded good!\nArriving at the bottom the first challenge\nwas to get 496 (our twin seat training glider)\nand its tow car up a20% incline single track\nroad, with some sharp looking bends thrown\nin for good measure! The solution was to\nleave the glider at the bottom of the hill and\nget a local with a land rover to tow it up,\nespecially as the locals knew how to cope with\noncoming traffic that panicked at the sight of\na glider trailer on such a narrow road.\nMost of the people who were coming for\nthe weekend arrived a couple of hours after\nthe glider, around li sh on Friday, and after\nrigging 496 we enjoyed some flying in the sun\nand our first taste of ridge soaring.\nRelying on rising air as they do, gliders\ntend to congregate on ridges. (The air blows\nup the side of the hill, and carries on up), and\nthe ' My nd is no exception. The added\ncomplication of hang glider pilots drifting\naround the airfield ensures that your lookout\nimproves dramatically - as Matt will testify\n(and no doubt his instructor, Sarah, as well...)\nOur hosts for the weekend, the Midlands\nGliding club, were very welcoming and\nfriendly and we rapidly found the bar in the\nevening. In fact we ended up running the bar,\nprobably because it was self service and the\ntaps were so difficult to stop when trying to\npour half a pint. Relations were so cordial\nthat Andrew managed to get thrown in a stagnant pond at midnight on the Saturday,\ntogether with the lady who orchestrated his\nducking. He should have been suspicious\nwhen he was asked outside to participate in\n'races' to cries of 'we need more My nd people', when there were already about ten\npeople gathering around him...\nSunday dawned grey and wet so we\npacked the glider and waved it off before we\ntook down our tent. In the meantime it had\nbecome suitable for bungee launching off the\nedge of the hill, so we stayed to watch and\nhelp with this spectacular sigh, before we left\nfor Lasham and home. Next year? Back to the\n'Mynd probably.\nFor more information about membership\nor a trial flight, or if you just want to see the\nphoto's of a very wet Andrew, come along to\nour Thursday meetings (Aero 266, l2 pm) or\nemail: j hm@ doc.ic.ac.uk. We are currently\norganising a summer trip to Le Blanc,\nFrance.\nUnderwater Club's Easter Trip\nKeys: Suck, Blow & Go\nMention to someone that you've just spent\nthe first week of the Easter vacation SCUBA\ndiving off Falmouth and their response can\nbe virtually guaranteed: \"Diving? in Britain?\nin March? you must be crazy!\" No just\nsuffering an addiction to Britain's fastest\ngrowing sport. The Easter trip annually\nmarks the start of the Underwater Club's diving season. After six months of training\ndives in the dregs of Imperial's swimming\npool, everyone lucky enough to get a place\nwas desperate for some \"real\" diving. For the\nnovices present, including myself, these\nwould be our first open water dives ever....\nAfter loading up a transit full of\nequipment and a minibus full of students we\nstarted our crawl out of London traffic,\nheading for the open roads that would whisk\nus to Falmouth! After seven hours of sitting\non wooden benches in a traffic jam, we\narrived in Falmouth. Cue the first pleasant\nsurprise of the trip, our home for the week\nwas one of half a dozen caravans: more\nluxurious than my digs in London. As we\nwere too late to do any diving that day, there\nwas nothing else for it but to go to the pub.\nThe 7.30am briefing signalled the start to\neach day, during which details of the days\nactivities were given and questions answered.\nBeing a newcomer to the game I was\nuncertain of what to expect. Any images of\nthe glamourous sport that appears on the\nHoliday program quickly disappeared, when I found myself huddled in the lee of a particularly old and knacker ed ICU minibus,\npulling my way into a wet-suit amid a late\nMarch hail storm.\nTraining had been in the swimming\npool, where the water was warm and clear,\nthis was substituted for the cold waters of the\nsea. Any familiarity that had been built up\nwith the equipment we'd used throughout\ntraining vanished the minute all the extra kit\nneeded for open water dives appeared. After\nyou'd worked your way into a wet-suit, hood,\ngloves, weight-belt (the list goes on...) not\nonly were you knacker ed, but even the\nsimplest of exercises became an ordeal.\nThe week's diving was to vary from\nintroductory shore dives in the sheltered\nwaters of Porthoustock cove, to meticulously\nplanned dives to a38m deep wreck. (Novices\nneed not apply!) Many of the dive sites were\nquite a way from the harbour where the RIB\n(a rigid hulled inflatable) was launched; in\nwhat were apparently \"moderate\" conditions,\njust the trip out to the dive site would put\neven the biggest roller-coaster to shame.\nVirtually all of the dives were on a wreck\nof one form or another and the majority still\nhad huge sections of steel, teeming with sea-life and begging to be explored. During the\nweek, people surfaced talking about\neverything from wrasse to co nger eels, small\nswimming crabs to the Godfather of all\nLobsters.\nThe week was fittingly brought to an\nend, as it started, in the pub with after dinner\nawards for all the people who had \"excelled\"\nthemselves during the week. A couple of the\nmore unusual being \"Hurler of the week\",\nawarded to Dave Taylor for being the only\nclub member to throw up both above the\nsurface and 20m below it. Steve Foster went\nhome the proud owner of \"The Albatross\" (a broken propeller) that is passed down\nthrough the club to the biggest liability of the\nmoment, for running the boat that he's spent\nso many hours maintaining onto a submerged\nreef.\na mm FELIX Hi "

A team of ten\nwill be rafting down the river Wye for charity.\nThe race will take three gruelling days\ncovering the distance from Hay-on-Wye to\nChepstow, some of the river is even in Wales!\nIt all started from a simple idea and one\nphone call, and has now grown into a major\nevent for the Union team entering this years\n\"Annual 100 Mile River Wye Charity Raft\nRace\", taking place over\n27 to the 29 May. The\nteam is made from all\nwalks of College life.\nDan Look and Ian\nParish the Deputy\nPresidents of the Union\nlead the team of Security Guards, Union Staff\nand Students. \"We wanted a Union team, but\nwe now have a team from a mixture of College\nand it works well\", said Dan, \"There are 73\nother teams in this race. We are the only\nStudents' Union team. It takes quite a bit of\norganisation.\" The raft is named \"The Prince\nConsort\", this was thought to be a suitable\nname considering the Unions' surroundings.\n\"With the team made from all walks of\nCollege life, this is a great exercise in industrial relationships\", Dan continued, \"all\nthe team realise that although this is going to\nbe a very tough weekend it is also going to be\ngood fun. We have already attended two\nmeetings in Hereford, but still no-one has\nanswered our biggest worry - how to go to the\ntoilet in the middle of the race?\"\nTo give you an idea of what is going to\nhappen to these people I shall run down some\nfacts for you: The raft is 50 foot long, 10 feet\nwide, takes fifty 25 litre barrels and weighs\nabout 600 lbs. The main structure of the raft\nis aluminium piping, with a foam filled fibreglass bow. We expect to be rafting for about 6\nhours each day. If we end up with a time\nunder 20 hours for the\n100 miles we shall be\npleased, the fastest teams\nwin in about 13 hours!\nThe likes of the Army,\nand British Telecom\nenter this race so with our\nlimited funding we will be happy just to\nfinish. \"This event is similar to a marathon\non your arms for three days running\", was the\nonly advice the rafts previous owners could\ncome up with! Apparently we are able to steer\nour raft. The only problem being is that when\nwe find ourselves heading for trouble we\nactually have to speed up, or else our rudder\nwon't work!\nThe ten rafters will be relying on our\nbackup team for support, food and mending\nany damage to the raft. The back up team are\nthe real workers, it will be the rafters who will\nbask in the glory. Luckily we have two Chefs\nRafting\nWild on the\nRiver Wye\nby Ian Parish\non the team, so we shouldn't end up down the\nDog and Duck every night. The organisers of\nthe race, CHAR, have managed to find a2000 person marquee and bar for the evenings'\nentertainments, so as long as we are still alive\nwe should have a good time.\nIf you would like to sponsor the rafters,\nthen there is a form in the Union Office. The\nfirst \u00a3500 raised will go the Pymlinon Trust\nand the rest to our nominated charities: the\nCollege Day Nursery and the Mangotsfield\nOpportunity Group.\nThis event has cost the participants a total of about \u00a31000. Both Dan and I are\nthankful to the mad men and women willing\nto give up their time for this adventure. We\nalso have to thank the following people for\ntheir support for us entering the race: Union\nManagement, Transport Committee, The\nBookstore and STA Travel.\nStudent\nHardship\nRising\n\"W*t is evident from the number of\n1 students using the Union advice\nill?* service that student financial\nhardship is continuing to increase. There are\ncases of students working long hours for low\nwages and others who have not eaten for\nseveral days in order to pay essential bills\nsuch as rent or fuel bills.\nThe budget at the end of 1994 was not\ngood news for students. Gillian Shepherd,\nSecretary of State for Education, revealed that\ninstitutions will have to make a financial cut\nof almost 3.5% per person as student numbers\nrise j. The rates for grants will be reduced\nwhich will result in more students having to\nrely on loans. Mature students will be badly\naffected by the abolishment of the allowance\nreceived by students over the age of twenty-six i. All in all, funding for higher education\nis to be cut by \u00a325 million in each of the next\ntwo academic years and will continue at the\nreduced figure into 1 9 9 7 / 8 To make matters\nworse, students are facing long delays in having their student loan applications\nprocessed and this has had a knock-on effect\non paying rent etc.\nWhile looking at the financial problems\nfaced by home students, we should remember\nthat international students outside the EEC do not receive LEA grants and cannot apply\nfor student loans.\n^%ff^\nessen tia! bills\"\nThere are discussions taking place\nwhich consider ways in which students can\npay for their education. Recent suggestions\ninclude the idea of students repaying\nmaintenance and possibly fee costs through\nnational insurance and tax. This added\nburden would be very worrying when most\nstudents already face having to repay student\nloans and large debts when they leave college.\nIt is thought that 18 to 21 year old students\nare accumulating debts over \u00a32000 and it is\npossible that older students may owe up to\n\u00a360002- The growing financial pressures may\ndiscourage people from poorer backgrounds\nfrom entering higher education in the future.\nIn addition, it is increasingly difficult to\nobtain funds from charities for students.\nIt can be said that student poverty exists\nnow, and measures which may worsen the\nsituation should be strongly opposed. How\ncan students who have to worry about\nmeeting their basic finances be expected to\ncope with the pressures of their studies?\nIt may be possible for institutions to\nintroduce schemes to assist students in\nfinancial difficulties such as providing cheaper accommodation, cheaper meals, help\nwith the cost of books and cheaper nursery\nplaces. Some colleges have set up systems to\nwaive or reduce fees in cases of extreme\nhardship. Current provisions such as the\naccess and hardship trust have helped many\nstudents to cope with the pressures that\nfinancial hardship brings.\nWe are rapidly approaching examination time - surely the most stressful time\nof the year for many students. This article is\nintended to highlight some of the financial\nproblems which can increase the pressure on\nstudents. Please be aware of this and refer any\nstudents under stress to people who may be\nable to help, such as the Union Adviser,\nCounsellor, or College Tutors.\nJ. Cummins and M.

Arts magazine, is\nscheduled to be published before\nthe end of this year. To do this, we\nneed contributions. These can be\nalmost anything (within reason) -poetry, prose, artwork,\nphotography, etc. The only proviso\nis that any writing should be\nreasonably short (500 words\nabsolute max). All contributions\nmust be in by the 25th May 1995.\nThey can be sent to the Felix office,\nor directly to me, the editor, either\nby internal or e mail.\nMarcus Alexander Mech Eng\nUG 3 (m. alexander@ic.ac.uk)\nThey Leave in\nShame\nDear FELIX,\nWe've been together at Imperial\nfor four years and we value the\nclose friendship between us and all\nthe good friends we've made and\nthe good times we've had here,\nincluding many a pleasant evening\nin Southside and the Union Bar.\nHowever, during all this time,\nwe have never felt the need to\nregale our fellow students with the\nsight of our genitals. We have\njustified this selfish attitude of ours\nby noting that in the sad,\noppressive world outside Imperial,\nwhere the enlightened libra l attitudes of the Constituent\nCollege Unions' Social Clubs sadly\ndo not prevail, such behaviour\ncould result in arrest by the Police\nand criminal prosecution.\nWe realise now that we have\nbeen reaping the social rewards of\nbeing members of Imperial\nCollege student society while\nourselves not respecting its\nillustrious traditions and not\nmaking the effort to adopt its\ngroundbreaking standards of\nbehaviour and social conscience.\nWe hereby wish to apologise\nfor this staggering display of\ninsensitivity on our part, and make\npublic our contrition and shame.\nWe realise it is now too late to\nmake amends, as it is not possible\nto atone in the little time we have\nleft here for the sins of our four\nyears. We wish also to thank our\nfellow Imperial students of the\nCCU Social Clubs for the tactful\ntolerance they have displayed in\nthe face of our arrogant\npresumptions. They have our\nsincere esteem and admiration,\nbut we will not insult their modesty\nwith unworthy flattery. No praise\ncan speak louder of them than the\npaean of their actions.\nYours etc,\nGeorge Karaolides\nXavier Siemens\nBenjamin Wandelt\nLetters maybe commented on by a guest editor, whose opinions are not necessarily\nthose of the editor, and cut\ndue to space restrictions.

    "content": "Standby\nTHE menu 'They tried and failed?' questioned Magpie. 'No. They tried\nand died' returns the sorry response. Yes it's dune on video.\n'Dune, desert planet...' he continues. Yes, yes, very good but\nI bet you can't do the parrot sketch?\nLots to do, no time to waste - tintin on corner shop's new\nalbum, Stylus on offspring, Bratt Anderson on pet lamb and\nNick on marion; those last three all live and kicking.\nSamin wandered lonely as a columnist trying to satisfy the\nsummer requirements of a demonic standby editor desperate\nto fill space. Unlike Wordsworth, Samin found 'his bit' of\nLondon. Read it in the column that refuses to die\nJenny Ho on the Cantona that is i.d., Magpie shoots from the\nlittle Jewish director with bullets over broadway and tintin\nsheds tears over the fate of the steal - they are your film\nteam. Listen and obey.\nCheeky chap pies, Jeremy Thomson, Matt Booth and Ali\nO 'Shay, produce mayhem and confusion in equal measures.\nThey are this week's happy rotation crew. Take it away...\ncurried\nOriginally released in 1984 - to\nless than universal praise - the\nDavid Lynch directed dune is a stunning science fiction film. In\npart this is due to its strong visual\nflair; for example the architecture\nand props are less Star Wars and\nmore early Flash Gordon with a dash of Dalian surrealism.\nHowever Lynch also has a totally\nunique view of Frank Herbert's original book, and with these\nelements combined he manages\nto create over two hours of\ncompelling viewing.\nYou have watch it several\ntimes to fully understand the\ncomplex plot though. David\nLynch's imagination often jumps\nfrom one idea to the next in an\nattempt convey all the background\ninformation, which leaves the\nviewer somewhat baffled.\nAlthough Dune may have\nmany intertwined themes, the\nunderlining plot involves the\nintergalactic politics of the Padisha\nEmperor, as he forces the House\nof Atreides to move to a desert\nplanet called Arrakis or Dune. The\nplanet's importance is that it's the\nonly place where the spice,\nmelange which allows travel\nthrough space and time, is found.\nWhoever controls the spice\nproduction, controls the universe.\nWhen originally released\nDune was hounded by the critics\nand flopped at the cinema, but\nwith the passing of time, it's become an undeniable cult classic.\nHaving it on video is a definite\nadvantage to understanding it too.\nFrom 8th May; \u00a310.990\nFELIX sunrise\nWith a title like woman's gotta have\nit, you might think that nothing's changed down corner shop way.\nWrong. Their fourth album sees a welcome move towards the trance y eastern twirls which have gained\nTjinder Singh such acclaim with side\nproject, Clinton.\nThere's something of the old\nag it pop on display though; tracks\nlike 'call all destroyer' and 'hong\nkong book of kung fu' still punch\ntheir weight. However, it's delights\nlike 'roof rack', with its floating lead\nguitar, and the eight minute roving\ndrum trip-out of 'looking for the way\nin', that really carry your ear with\nhop skip and jump. And whilst there\nare the odd papered-together\ncracks, overall Cornershop appear\nto be heading towards a surprisingly\ntuneful horizon. (7)\nThey may look like Pavement\nbut quicksand they snarl and the\nlead singer has an aversion to\nmelody. It's fast industrial punk-metal, only they seem to have\nignored the last ten years\nprogression in both those genres to\nproduce a very dull sound. The\nnasty looking skins lap it up though;\nthe bald row of heads nodding like\nsome fleshy executive toy, but there\nwas nothing there.\nSo to the offspring. They take\nto the stage and the crowd go\nabsolutely mental. The mosh is\nenormous, everyone sings all the\nwords, twenty girls to my left pick up\nwhere Riot Grrl went wrong and\nspill their own blood away from the\nbullies at the front and I admit I'm carried away with the enthusiasm.\ncorner shop But their second song sounds like\ntheir first, which isn't much different\nto the third.\nStill, the performance is great\nand involves a singing vocal\naudition, an audience demanded\ns nog between two strangers and a thirty strong mass stage dive! But\n'self-esteem', together with\nWeezer's 'sweater song' stand out\nembarrassingly from the rest.\nIt's telling that they encore with\nNirvana's 'territorial pissing s' and\nalready the song seems an historical\nrelic. As the new kids on the\nterritory arrive, we're into our\nsecond generation of popular\n'alternative' bands. Unfortunately\nthe standard is already falling.\npet lamb are kind of hard to\nmake out. It's not because they're\non another plane being unique, it's more they're doing their own thing\nand anything worth something has\nsome sort of individuality.\nThe Irish quartet open like they\nmean to go on with 'the bast*d',a word that crops up with such\nfrequency in tonight's set you\nwonder they they know anyone they\nactually like. Anyhow they go on\nand upwards in their pop/hardcore\nbreeding quest. Their last single,\n'where did your plans go?' and the\nall out trash attack of 'insult to\ninjury' were just two excellent\nexamples of a band torturing a skewed tune with violent noise.\nThey finished with a(n in)tense\n'never rest again'. Its catchy refrain;\n\"and I will kill you in the end, cos\nyou will never rest again\" combined\nwith a melody to die for. I'm sure\nthe band would be happy to oblige.\n'Get there for the doors', said\nVik. I realised my mistake as\npur essence completed their set\nwithin the first 10 minutes of me\narriving. From what I could tell they\nappeared to have it together -congratulations to the sound man\nwho produced a well defined sound.\nAs for the band? Well they could\nhave been Gene on a bad day.\nAfter a pleasingly short break\nmarion appeared and blew the\nsupport away; both musically and in\nthe volume sense. They kicked off\nwith 'falling through'; full of energy\nand power followed by 'moving\nfast'. Towards the end, Marion\nappeared to loose the plot a little\nbut then pulled their gem of a debut\nsingle, 'sleep', out of the fire.\nFollowing tumultuous applause they\nreturned for a encore that consisted\nof the most impressive track yet:\n'father's day'. 0\ncorner shop "

    "content": "Standby\n^ stagnant kop\ni.d. It took me a long time to think of a bit of London that, well, represented my London. Then I remembered the canal.\nThe canal moves from A to B, from Camden Town to Kings\nCross, from one part of London to\nanother. The A and B could only\nbe London places. The canal, the\nroute, could only be a London\ncanal. Once proud, a useful part\nof the city, now the dirty water just\nreflects the grime of the structures\naround it.\nCamden Town itself is a peculiar place. It's \"trendy\" I suppose. I use the word in quotes\nbecause Camden Town is\nconsidered, thought, known, to be\ntrendy. Yes, there are the clubs,\ncafes, bars. But because it's considered to be trendy the\ntourists - the young Japanesedescend. In a way the Market is\nthe symbol of the Town, of London\nTown. You can buy and sell\nanything there.\nIt takes several twists and\nturns along the canal to get away\nfrom Camden Town. You see the\nlast bit of the designer Sainsbury's. You walk along and the new signs\ninform you that the waterway is\nnow a property of Thames Water\npic or whoever. The canal is dirty.\nBottles, condoms, carrier bags -the disposables of our age pop\ntheir heads out of the green water.\nBut there is an alternative\npicture of the canal. You have to\nlook for it. There are house boats,\nthe wildlife reserve. And on sunny\ndays couples sit at the edge of the\ncanal and open a bottle of wine.\nThe house boats remind me of\nAmsterdam. But there the boats\nare actually homes. Here they are\nshelter for people escaping from\nthe city, for people who cannot\nafford to live in \"proper\" houses.\nHalf an hour, forty minutes\nlater, you get to Kings Cross. Kings\nCross, the exit to the North. Kings\nCross, famous for boy prostitutes\nand drug addicts. The once-proud\nrailway station is neglected and\ngrimy. Islington, a sign says, lies\nhalf a mile away. Ah, English\ncivilisation is within reach. The\ncontrast to the start of my journey\nis sharp: Camden Town is full of\nshops, the hustle and bustle of a so uk; Kings Cross is dead, nothing\nmore than an intersection. From\nwhere I stand now I can see the\nnew British Library building\nstruggling to rise.\nThis is our Pergau. A sign of\nour times; of money-gobbling\ninitiatives that benefit only the\nelite pass holders. O In i.d., four policemen go\nundercover at a London football\nclub to investigate hooliganism.\nAssuming the identities of football\nthugs, they attempt to get close\nenough to the ringleaders to put\nthem away. However, the football\nand hooliganism merely act as a background to a psychological\ndrama which follows the decline\ninto violence of one of their\nnumber, John.\nGoing undercover changes\nJohn (Reece Dinsdale); he finds that\nhe cannot help enjoying the\nviolence which occurs on the\nfootball terraces. Not only that, but\nit begins to play a part in his\nhome life as well.\nReleased during a period when\nthe levels of aggression on the\npitch, as well as on the terraces, are\nincreasing, i.d. confronts the\nmonstrosity of football hooliganism.\nStill Phi//p Dov/s' directorial debut is\nnot a film which people will come\nout saying they enjoyed, but it's certainly a film which both engages\nand intrigues.\nIt's undeniable. Woody Allen is\nback on track with bullets over\nBroadway, following his home side turmoil and, Oscars aside, it's even\nmade money!\nJohn Cusak plays David, a New\nYork playwright, eager to see his\nmasterpiece on stage. Financial\nbacking finally comes conditionally\nfrom New York's local gangster\nboss; the boss wants his girl, Olive\n(Meg Tilly], to have a part in the\nplay. David's dilemma is to direct\nthe play without offending the\ngangland boss. His job is made\neven harder thanks to the\ncontinuous script changes forced by\nOlive's bodyguard - someone\nwhose writing talent comes from a harsh life in the real world.\nThe exuberance of all the\ncharacters lifts the film from being\n'another Woody Allen film' to a hilariously funny film. Di'anne Wiest\nhas one of the most memorable\nroles; her manipulative charms\nhave David drooling at every\nencounter. She gives him energy\nwhile taking the play and subtly\nmolding certain parts to prop up\nher own aging career.\nWhen the play finally reaches\nthe stage the change is evident.\nDavid has to face the problem of\nwhether or not he has betrayed the\nart of writing to win success on\nBroadway.\nIf you've never seen a Woody\nAllen film before, Bullets over\nBroadway is an excellent starting\npoint.\nWell, usual as it may seem, I feel I'm out on an unusual limb.\nEveryone and their blind grandmother seems convinced, the steal\nis an awful film. Even Barry 'I wouldn't know a creditable attempt\nat the cinematographers' art if it\npassed me fifty quid - thanks very\nmuch rise, time to raise eyebrows in\nmy sexy if demure way' Norman\nhas given it the proverbial NY\ncheer. So why did I find it funny?\nMmm mm, probably because I thought '4w& f was such a fag-end.\nWith one exception (American\nof course), The Steal's cast is fine\nand British - heck it's even got\nStephen Fry and Jack Dee in bit\nparts! Of course the plot is, in the\nmain, twee, there's some awful\ntechno babble and the odd cringe\nworthy part, but I 'll repeat (for\nclarity); in parts this film was very\nfunny. If you see Outbreak instead\nyou deserve everything you get. 0\n0 rotation\nEvery artist has their own sound\nand to compare them to others is\nunfair, it restricts their image not\nonly to the comparison, but when\ntwo or more similarities are cited,\nto the narrow Venn overlap.\nHence Matt Booth and I, Jeremy\nT, have attempted the task of\nwholly independent reviews....\npinkie mac iure hedonistic\nj; blatant name and an orchestral intro add interest to this\notherwise obscure trance track. It\nthat a man or a Pinkie?\nm;I hope it's not a blok e with a hair cut like that. Sounds like a computer game.\nthe verve - this is music\nm; not very original.

Various\nactivities from stuffing cream\ncrackers to talking to giant flowers,\nwere on offer to the punters, all in\naid of charities such as the Red\nCross and the Marie Curie Cancer\nResearch Fund. Ian Robertson,\nRAG Chair, told FELIX that\nthere was some concern about the\nweather, threatening attendance and\nbringing the long-awaited mud-wrestling into doubt. \"When we had\nthe sun, the place was packed for\nhalf an hour,\" Mr Robertson\nexplained. However one activity on\noffer, the opening of Queen's Tower\nwhich allowed panoramic views for\nSOp climb, proved so popular that\nmany called for the Tower to be\nopen all year round. Luckily as the\nday wore on, the weather held.\nMud-wrestling finally took place in\nthe late afternoon, and the\nremaining faithful were lucky\nenough to be drawn into the messy\nfray! Rag have raised in excess of\n\u00a320,000 so far this year.\n(Bottomley continues from page on\nundergraduate and postgraduate\ncolleges into a fraction of the\noriginal space would lead to an\nimprovement in facilities. The\nnew site at Imperial is planned to\nhouse both St Mary's and\nCharing Cross and Westminster\nMedical Schools, the National\nHeart and Lung Institute and\nthe Royal Postgraduate Medical\nSchool. The possibility of the\nInstitute of Cancer Research\njoining is still being considered\nbut the building will definitely\ninclude Imperial College's Department of Biology.\nThe sometimes acrimonious\nWestminster debate saw the\nGovernment under pressure\nfrom both Conservative MP's as\nwell as the Opposition. Mrs Bottomley was accused of\nstorming ahead with unpopular\nand discredited proposals. These\nwere described as cost-cutting\nmeasures which threaten patient\ncare and research. The bulk of\nthe discussion clearly focussed\non the controversial decisions to\nscrap accident and emergency\nservices at a number of London\nhospitals. The call to reconsider\nthe 'widely challenged assumptions that underpin the\nTomlinson Report' could also\nhave implications for the\nchanges planned for medical\neducation and research.\nt^/ori a I^=N US Last Day\nRemember that today is your last\nchance to vote in the NUS referendum. It is difficult to\nguess at the result at the moment.\nEarly on it seemed like the 'no'\nvoters were staying away, hoping\nthat the vote would be in quo rate. As the week has progressed\nhowever, they too have begun to\ncast ballots, fearful of one\nthousand 'yes' votes. I'm actually\nquite excited that the whole\nthing is coming to an end at last.\nFull results and analysis, as they\nsay, in next week's issue.\nBegging Bowl\nWell this week we've had to drop\nto sixteen pages. I don't blame\nanyone - I know how scared\npeople are about getting a job and\nobtaining the necessary quality of\ndegree - but I hope no-one\nblames me! In an attempt to halt\nthe slow insidious decline we\nwill, from next week, be letting\nloose some of the things we've\nwanted to do all year. I hope it\ndoesn't appear to gratuitous.\nAll contributions still very\ngratefully accepted.\nVE Day\nCall me a friendless (veteran)\nthan ker but I found myself alone\nin Hyde Park on monday night.\nThe atmosphere was strange.\nUnlike one acquaintance I made\nno attempt to break into the\nsecure celebration 'compound' .\nInstead I walked the grounds\namongst tens of thousands of\nothers. It seemed more a rock\nfestival than an official state day\nof celebration, such was the mix\nof people and the heady\ncombination of poor amps,\nsmoke, and lights. Oh, and the\ntourists.\nI did find myself wondering\nat one stage just how many, if any, of the assembled were\nactually British! I heard in fact\nmore of the 1940's 'baddies'\naccents! It reminded me of an old\nscience fiction story I once read.\nIt featured the experience of a group of time-travelling Christian Tourists (it was written in straight faced 1950's super science speak so don't smirk) who go on\na tour to see the selection of Jesus\nover Barabus as the criminal to\nbe sent to his death.\nThey are told by the travel\ncompany that under no circumstances could they attempt to\nsave Christ, as this would alter\nthe timeline. Instead, they are\ndressed in robes and encouraged\nto chant for Barbaras along with\nthe Jews. As the tempo rises the\ncries get more fierce; only at the\nlast moment do they notice the\nJews are silent around the edges\nof the crowd, which consists\nentirely of tourists.\nWhy were the cheers for an\nancient Vera Lynn so strident?\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nAssistant Printer Jeremy Thomson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Wei Lee\nEditorial Team\nArt & Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kate Cox\nLayout and Design Rebecca Walters\nMusic Vik Bonsai\nNews WalS\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nPuzzles Tim St Clair\nS Flles Rebecca Mileham\nEight Day Guide Jeremy Thomson\nSport Juliette Decode on d Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week Jon Jordan, Andy\nSinharary, Jeremy T Typing Tim St. Clair\n\\i mm FELIX m "

As\nthe Choir break into song, twenty or so\ndrunken students, in various states of\nundress, take a leap of faith from the bridge\ninto less than four feet of water. Does\nanything better demonstrate the glorious\nstupidity and zest for life of the Oxbridge\nupper middle class? In fact so popular has\nthe scene become that over fifteen thousand\nspectators gather to watch it. But what was\ndifferent this year? A certain Jocelyn\nWitchard, that's what.\n\"Every year drunken fell as jump in. I wanted to be the first girl to strip off and do\nit,\" said Jocelyn, 22, quoted in The Sun the\nnext day under the headline ' Dip, dip\nHoorays'. 'Jocelyn splashed around swigging\nchampagne as Hooray Henry pals whooped\nwith delight,' The Sun continued in its\n'crayon style'.\nThe Mail also covered the story,\nalthough they chose to use the title, 'Miss\nWitchard', and managed to publish a slightly\nmore circumspect picture (it's amazing what\nyou can hide with long, if wet, hair).\nSensitive to its audience however, the\narticle's leader included the phrase: 'How\nwould you feel if she was your daughter?'\nThe breakfast tables of A level students\naround the country must have trembled.\nJust in case any mothers were\nunconvinced, The Mail also decided to\nconduct an interview with Mrs Francis\nWitchard: 'a community housewife who is\nmarried to Maurice, a retired RAF chief\ntechnician', it eagerly informed readers. \"Oh\ndear,\" was her first pearl of wisdom. Still,\nfurther questioning resulted in \"I expect she\nRIDGE TOO\nwas a bit drunk at the time\" and \"She's never\ndone anything like this before\". With a last\nvague foray into feminism - 'She does feel\nwomen should have equal opportunities in\nlife' - it appeared that was the end of the\nwhole matter. A sudden rush of blood and\nalcohol to the head, a couple of photographs\nand no harm appeared to have been done. At\nmost there would be a brief period of fame or\nembarrassment and a couple of worried\nphone calls from home but that would be all.\n'Girl from St. Thrillda's' screamed The\nSun's banner. 'Now she takes the plunge as\nthe star of page 3'. Whoops!\nTaking The Sun's Penny (actually\n\u00a31,000) was probably the stupidest move\nJocelyn, or 'Joss' as The Sun now familiarly\ncalled her, could have made after leaping\nfeature\nover the bridge in the first place. Not only\nwas she described as 'b awd and gown less', a 'diving belle' and a 'water babe', she became a bit player in The Sun's continual attempt to\njustify Page 3. Joss' quasi-feminist line now\nread more like a battle cry. \"I'm proud of my\nbody and I'm happy to share it, especially for\nThe Sun\" she said. Words which have graced\nthe mouth of many a bimbo were now aped\nby The Sun-styled 'brainy beauty'.\nThere was also mention of two further\ndevelopments. One was that she had lived for\nthree years with a37 year old man and the\nsecond was a confession: \"I take my clothes\noff all the time\". So much for the homely\nsuggestions of dear old mum. Still The Sun\ndid manage to include a picture of her\nparent's house with the helpful description,\n'respectable'.\nOf course that was not an end to the\nmatter. On the same day as the page 3, the\nlate editions of The Evening Standard replied\nwith the headline, 'Why Joss is the shame of\nSt. Hilda's'. Taking The Mail's lead, this\nechoed the now latest sentiments of 'midwife\nMrs Witchard, 57' concerning her wayward\ndaughter. \"She is naked in this picture but\nshe is wearing her college cap in a way that\nmakes fun of the college,\" Frances was\nreported as saying.\nThe Sun kept the story firmly on the\nboil with a follow up double page spread the\nfollowing day. Although Joss's ex-lover had\nmysteriously aged six years, from 37 to 43 in\n24 hours, at least he now had a name. 'Hippy\nBarry Raithby' was pictured showing The\nSun's photographer, 'inside the cramped van\nwhere they shared nights of love on an old\nbrown bed'.\n\"She is just a beautiful genius,\" Barry\nremarked, echoing a line that The Sun had\nalready made quite clear. He also repeated\nthat Joss had a habit of stripping in public\nand said that he had watched her go in on\nthat 'fatal' bridge-jumping morning.\nBack the dreaming towers, Joss' college\nauthorities were becoming none to pleased\nwith all the attention. In particular the use of\nphrases such as 'Hildabeasts' to describe the\nantics of the college's all female members was\nnot being taken lightly. \"We are a serious\nacademic college,\" their common room\npresident, Ms Diola, commented.\nAnd so to the moral. What initially\nseemed to be simple case of clothes off and\ninto river at second sight now appears rather\nmore by z antin ian. Can we really still swallow\nthat it happened on the spur of the moment'?\nThe differences between 18,000 Oxford\nonlookers in the flesh and four and a half\nmillion Sun readers in the 'black and white\nand red all over' has never looked so small.
