    "content": "This week it was reported that The\nTimes Education Commission\u2019s final\nreport will contain details of the\neffects of lockdowns on children, and\nthey make for grim reading. Children\nin reception cannot say their own\nnames or drink from a cup. Some\nteachers have reported over half of\ntheir classes turning up still wearing\nnappies. Children as old as\nsix have been brought to\nschool in buggies as this\nprovides the path of least\nresistance to the parents.\nThe question \u201ccan I have\na drink please?\u201d, normally\nwithin the volcabulary\nof a reception age\nchild, will instead\nsay \u201cbot-bot\u201d to\ntell their teacher they\u2019re\nthirsty. Just a few months\nafter the beginning of the\nfirst lockdown, Ofsted had reported\nthat children who had learned how\nto use cutlery had regressed since\nschools had been closed. Children\nare unable to properly understand the\nemotions of others, and some have\nhypothesised that the prevelance of\nmasks in public life has stunted their\nability to read faces. The difference\nin these areas between children from\npoor and well-off backgrounds is\nstark, and increases hugely with age.\nOn the other end of the\nspectrum, 16 year olds from poorer\nbackgrounds are on average 18\nmonths academically behind their\nricher counterparts, amounting\nessentially to the entire locked down\nperiod being lost education for those\nless privileged. Not to mention the\nlack of social development that\nmay rear its head once those in that\ndemographic reach higher education.\nThe bitter irony is that childen were\nall but immune to death from covid -excludingextremecircumstances,close\nto zero children died from the virus.\nIt is impossible to intuitively weigh\nthese effects against death tolls -how does one balance the stunted\ndevelopment of children who are safe\nfromthevirus,againstthehealthrisksto\ntheelderlyandimmunocompromised?\nWe also don\u2019t even really know\nthe effects yet. It would be extremely\nunscientific to suggest that a band of\ncurrent children will\ngrow up less developed\nthan their slightly\nolder counterparts,\nbut we don\u2019t know.\nChildren deserve\nthe most praise and\nrepayment for the\nperiods we spent in\nlockdown. Most spent\nwell over a year sheltering\nagainst a virus, that they would\nbarely notice if they caught, for the\ngood of those vulnerable members\nof society. Too young to vote or\nproperly express their opinons, their\nneeds were widely shoved far down\nthe priorities list by adults taking\ndecisions on their behalves, and in\nmany cases neglecting them because\nthe pandemic was overwhelming\nfor everyone. The trend of pacifying\nchildren with iPads that was already\non the up skyrocketted, and now some\nteachers report that children arrive\nat school with leg muscles so underdeveloped that they cannot manage\nthe amount of walking required in a\nnormal school day, through being left\nin front of the TV for so many hours.\nAnother pandemic will happen,\nand it may happen in our lifetimes. It\nis not clear to me what the best path\nforward in balancing the competing\ninterests of different demographics is,\nbut it is clear that the children\u2019s side\nof the equation was not given nearly\nenough attention when assessing\nthe effects of lockdowns for ovid-19. I hope this is different next time.\n2\nAmeena Hassan DeputyEditor\nAlex Jackson ArtsEditor\nAlexander Cohen ArtsEditor\nBoxuan Zhang ArtsEditor\nJamie John ScienceEditor\nMarek Cottingham ScienceEditor\nJonah Hewett FilmEditor\nEva Borras FilmEditor\nCara Burke ScienceEditor\nZanna Buckland BooksEditor\nBencan Yalcin FoodEditor\nKhama Gunde\nComment\nEditor\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of\nAnd our numerous\ncontributors\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nChildren in lockdown\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton,Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2020\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

    "content": "Recently pushed to Netflix (and perfect as part\nof a post exam binge), Gangubai Kathiawadi is loosely based on the real-life story of a young\nwoman tricked into prostitution from a position of privilege and her rise into power as a mad-am, political activist and more in Nehru\u2019s India.\nSetalongthebackdropofthestreetsofMumbai,this\nfilm is filled with sweeping shots and beautiful compositions that director Sanjay Leela Bhansali is famed for.\nThe transition into musical numbers can seem jarring\nfor an unfamiliar audience, but one is quickly overwhelmed by the raw emotion on display in these scenes.\nArjit Singh in particular stuns as he always does and\nShreyaGoshaal\u2019svoiceisangelicoverthefilm\u2019smostintimateromanticscenes.Musicalandvisualcomposition\nhavebeencombinedwonderfullytocreateatreatforany\nviewer,evenonewhoknowsjustaslittleHindiasmyself.\nShantanu Maheshwari deserves credit for his performance as the main romantic lead, displaying emotional\nvulnerabilityandrangewonderfully.AjayDevganinpar-ticular steals the show every time he appears as Gangubai\u2019s underworldally KarimLala,althoughsomeofhis\nscenesarealittletoocomedicandslapstickformytastes.\nBut this movie has only one star. Alia Bhatt puts on\na magnetic performance as our main character Gangubai, mesmerizing and controlling seemingly throughout the film. This is a challenging role and could have\neasily fallen flat, but Bhatt tackles it with such fearlessness and fervor, that one cannot help but fall in love\nwith our heroine (or anti-heroine??). As we are taken\nthrough different chapters of Gangubai\u2019s life, Alia\nBhatt maintains this air of supreme confidence and\nstrength for the majority of her performance, which\nforms the soul of the film. However, she also beautifully captures the pain of the situation and it is these\ndisplaysofvulnerabilitythatresonateemotionallywith\nthe viewer (or at least it did with this viewer!) and allow\nus an intimate connection with our protagonist and\nperhaps an even greater respect for her achievements\nin the face of adversity. I can only do this performance\nso much justice in words, but the iconic image above\nof Gangubai in her sunglasses should give you an idea\nof the fear and desire she elicits from the men around\nher, executed well by our lead and her supporting cast.\nThis characterisation achieves something rarely seen\nin media across the globe, which is a well-written female anti-hero, one that provokes both sympathy and\nrespect, but is not without its flaws. In some ways, the\nfilm glamorises and romanticises the life of Gangubai\nand shys away from criticising the harsher choices she\nmakes, especially when Gangu\u2019s political ambitions are\nexploredinthelatterhalf.Furthermore,theepisodicna-tureofthefilmpreventsadeeperdiveintohercharacter\ndevelopment,potentiallyleavingviewerswantingmore.\nAs the film progresses, we see Gangubai stand up for\ntherightsoftheprostitutesandtheirchildren,andatthe\nclimax Alia Bhatt powerfully delivers a speech which I\nthink any viewer from across the globe could stand to\nlistento.Nomatteryourviewontheworld\u2019soldestprofession and its morality, this is a reminder that these are\nhuman beings still worthy of respect and still rings true\nwiththechangingnatureofsexworkinthemodernday.\nThis is a daring project from SL Bhansali and melds\na grittier and darker subject theme with the charm,\ncomedy, musical treats and high production value of\nthe classic Bollywood blockbusters. This could easily\nhave felt inauthentic, but thanks to Alia Bhatt\u2019s best\nperformance yet, and the respect and sensitivity shown\nto the subject matter, we get something that delivers\non nearly every front. Perhaps we are witnessing a shift\nin direction from Bollywood, usually more conserva-tive, especially with projects involving its biggest stars.\nFor a global audience unfamiliar with Bollywood or\nforeign media, I can imagine no better introduction.\nGangubai Kathiawadi\nFilm Review\nFRIDAY 17TH JUNE 2022\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nJonah Hewett\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 11\nSachin Wijeyaratnam Film Writer\nDirectedby: Sanjay Leela Bhansali\nStarring: Alia Bhatt, Arjit Singh, Shreya Goshaal\nYear: 2022\nA new era for Bollywood?\nThe future of CBBC\nLast month, BBC director-general Tim Davies\nannounced a several cuts to television program-ming, including moving BBC Four and CBBC to be\nonline only. This came following an announcement\nfrom Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries (possibly\nthe least cultured culture secretary we\u2019ve ever had)\nthat the licence fee would be frozen for two years.\nI can\u2019t help but feel a little concerned by the\nCBBC move in particular. Growing up in the\nUK, CBBC (the children\u2019s BBC) was one of the\nfew children\u2019s television channels that was available for free (once you\u2019d paid your licence fee).\nCBBC programmes have often offered a lot of educational value as well as entertainment. Beloved\nclassics like Newsround are brilliant at introducing\nchildren to watching and engaging with the news and\nthe wider world. Then there\u2019s Deadly 60, a personal fa-vourite, and everybody remembers Horrible Histories,\nwithout which I think we\u2019d all struggle to name every\none of Henry VIII\u2019s wives (and much more besides).\nYou might say, why does it matter whether it\u2019s online or not? Most kids are online these days and frequently accessing Youtube and streaming services. And\nyou\u2019re probably right. The pandemic, though, recently brought into focus our increasing reliance on digital services - and highlighted the number of families\nwho struggle to access them. A 2019 report from the\nOffice for National Statistics on the UK\u2019s \u2018digital divide\u2019 showed that only 51% of families with a household income between \u00a36000 and \u00a310,000 had access\nto internet. Clearly, such families might also struggle\nto pay the TV licence fee of \u00a3159, although at \u00a313.25\na month it still comes in below the average monthly\nbroadband cost of \u00a330.30 (according to Glide.co.uk).\nThere\u2019s also the consideration that kids might be safer\nwatching a controlled television channel rather than\nsubjected to the various content risks on the internet.\nBut in the end, maybe I\u2019m just falling victim to a weird cathode-ray nostalgia, and it really doesn\u2019t matter. I suppose only time will tell.\nJonah Hewett Film Editor\nComment\n\n"

    "content": "Ying-Yang literally translates to \u201cdark\nand light\u201d. It is one of the most famous symbols in the world representing\nthe balance between two opposite poles:\nnight and day, dark and light, evil and\ngood, and so on. But what many people\ndo not know is the source of inspiration\nbehind this symbol. Surprisingly, Taoists were not inspired ancestral fights\nbetween gods or demons, or mythical\nkings. Instead, their source of inpisra-tion is thought to have been two Chinese giant salamanders entwined with\neach other, forming a perfect circle in\nwhich the mouth of one salamander is\nchasing the tail of the other. However,\nthe Chinese giant salamander can lay\nclaim to far more than being the inspiration for the Yin-Yang symbol. It is the\nbiggest amphibian in the world, an animal exclusive to China. It is also, unfor-tunately, a culinary delicacy, a fact that\nhas put this majestic species on the brink\nof extinction.\nThe Chinese giant salamander is native to the ponds and streams of Southwest China. It is dark brown with a flat,\nlarge body and has a broad head, with\nsmall, lidless eyes. The most incredible\nphysical characteristic of the species is\nits size. Chinese giant salamanders have\nbeen known to weigh up to 60kg and to\nreach almost two metres in length. Fortunately, the Chinese giant salamander\nisgenerallyharmlessforhumans.Itfeeds\non a variety of organisms, ranging from\ninsects and worms, to small vertebrates\nsuch as frogs and fish. Cases of cannibalism in the Chinese giant salamander\nhave also been reported. Indeed, studies\nof the food in the stomach of different\nspecimens have found body parts of\nother Chinese giant salamanders, compounding to around \u00bc of the total food\ncontent.\nThe Chinese giant salamander is an\nextremely territorial animal, with its\nterritory covering around 30m3\nof the\nbody of water. The only time that Chinese giant salamanders can cohabit in\nthe same territory is during the mating period. Indeed, cohabiting is one\nof their courtship displays in order to\ndemonstrate a willingness to reproduce.\nOther courtship displays also include\nactivities such as riding or chasing. After\ncopulation, the Chinese giant salamander lays a maximum of 500 eggs. This is\nmuch lower than other amphibian spe-cies, who usually lay thousands of eggs.\nWhen the larvae hatch, they possess external gills to breathe underwater. However, the adult giant salamander loses its\ngills, instead breathing through its skin.\nContrary to many other amphibians\nthat live both in the water and on the\nland, the Chinese giant salamander is\nexclusively an aquatic animal, spending\nits whole life underwater. These animals\nhave incredibly long average lifespans,\nliving around 60 years. There is another similarity between the Chinese giant\nsalamander and humans: the sound. The\nChinese giant salamander emits a sound\nsimilar to the cry of a child, which is why\nit is also called (W\u00e1w\u00e1y\u00fa) in Mandarin Chinese, translated as \u2018infant fish\u2019.\nSometimes, this creates the impression\nthat a child is crying in the river, deceiving people.\nThe actions of human beings are\nputting the Chinese giant salamander,\nwhich has remained largely unchanged\nfor 170 million years, at high risk of ex-tinction. There are several factors which\nhave played a part in this. First, the\nbuilding of cities, dams, roads and other\ninfrastructures is destroying the native\nhabitat of the Chinese giant salamander.\nThese large animals need a lot of space\nto supply them with enough food. They\nare also highly sensitive to pollution.\nSecond, the Chinese giant salamander\nis considered a delicacy and is employed\nin Chinese traditional medicine. In the\npast, consumption levels of the Chinese\ngiant salamander were low because most\nof the population was poor and hence,\ncould not afford it. However, in modern China, individual wealth has increased significantly, meaning that now,\nmore people can and will pay for a dish\nof Chinese giant salamander. This has\nmotivated farmers to overharvest salamanders from the wild, shrinking their\npopulation.\nOne potential solution is raising Chinese giant salamanders in captivity. The\nproblemwiththisisthatfarmerstakethe\nlarvaefromtheirnaturalhabitatsinstead\nof breeding Chinese giant salamanders\nthemselves; breeding the salamanders is\nat present extremely difficult. This only\nexacerbates the extinction threat, since\nit reduces the wild population of Chinese giant salamander. Finding a solution to the breeding problem could save\nthe entire species. Thus, more research\non the reproductive mechanisms of the\nChinese giant salamanders is required.\nTo this end, the ZSL London Zoo is\ncarrying out an important conservation\nprogramme to protect the Chinese giant\nsalamander, while collaborating with local communities in China.\nTo summarise, the Chinese giant salamander is a significant part of the Chinese culture and is also a unique animal.\nUnfortunately, it is disappearing and we,\nas humans, are the culprits.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nThe Chinese giant salamander\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nChinese giant salamander\nPetr Hamern\u00edk/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n"

Your only limit is\nyour imagination (and pot size).\nThis recipe for a vegan stew is perfect to make in bulk,\neitherasamealtoprepandrefrigerateforbusyweeksor\nto split with your friends (a great way to make evening\nmeals both cheaper and quicker). With butternut\nsquash, chickpeas, and lentils, this stew is bursting with\nsuperfoods to boost your protein, vitamins, fibre and\niron levels (shout out to all my vegetarian anaemics out\nthere) as well as being low in both fat and salt. Using an\nimpressively short list of spices that you will either find\ninyourkitchen,orareworthpickingupfortheirgeneral\nuse, this dish manages to capture the smells and flavours\nof a Moroccan street market whilst requiring minimal\nprep time and effort. It can also be easily adapted from a\nsimple dish using (mostly) kitchen staples to something\na bit more bougie.\nIngredients - Serves 8\n\u2022 4 tbsp Oil (veg or olive)\n\u2022 4 onions\n\u2022 5 cloves of garlic\n\u2022 3 celery sticks\n\u2022 3 tsp of black pepper\n\u2022 4 tsp of turmeric\n\u2022 1 tsp cinnamon\n\u2022 175g red lentils (split or whole)\n\u2022 4 tins of chickpeas\n\u2022 4 tins of chopped tomatoes\n\u2022 2 large or 3 small butternut squash\n\u2022 1.2l of veg stock\n\u2022 200g of orzo (or other small pasta)\n\u2022 Half a tin of sweetcorn\n\u2022 A small handful of fresh parsley, coriander,\njust something green to garnish\nPrep\n1. Peel the butternut squash until all the skin and pale flesh is removed leaving orange flesh only. Cut it in\nhalf lengthwise and scoop out the seeds then cut the squash into 2-3cm cubes.\n2. Dice the onions (Google \u201cWaitrose - How to Dice an Onion\u201d for useful method - advice may be one of\nthe only affordable things Waitrose offers).\n3. Roughly chop garlic and cut celery into \u00bd cm pieces.\nCooking\n4. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and fry the onions for a few minutes then add celery, garlic, black pep-per, cinnamon and turmeric.\n5. After 5 minutes or when the onions are translucent, add tomatoes, chickpeas and lentils and bring to the\nboil.\n6. Add the stock and squash, cover and simmer gently for around 45 minutes or until the squash is tender\n(but not mush), stirring periodically to avoid sticking.\n7.

Combine flour, salt, oil and gradually stir\nin enough water to make a soft, elastic but not\nsticky dough.\n2. Knead on a floured surface for 5-10 minutes and divide into 12 pieces\n3. Roll the pieces into very thin disks and\ncook in a lightly greased frying pan on high heat\nuntil the underside has dark brown spots, about\n30 a side.\nThe recipe is fantastically flexible and forgiving.\nOrzo can be replaced with rice, vermicelli or\neven spaghetti (if you\u2019re feeling particularly\nsacrilegious). Sweet potato can be substituted for\nsquash if you can\u2019t find it or don\u2019t feel like wrestling\nwith one, with very similar health benefits. Finally,\nfor those on a more relaxed budget, these extra\nsuggestions can change it from kitchen staple to\ndate night special.\nExtra Suggestions\n- Stewing beef or lamb (50-100g per person)\nadded with the tomatoes. (halal, non-vegan)\n- A pinch of saffron will give it an even deeper\norange colour.\n- A generous splash of red wine while it simmers\nprovides a deep and rich flavour. Recommend anything\nbetween \u00a35-8 for cooking with. (vegan, non-halal)\n- Some chopped dates sprinkled on top to serve.\n\n"

    "content": "Located just a few hundred metres from the more\nrecently opened The Junction Market, Nag\u2019s Head\nMarket has been providing a place for vendors to sell\ntheir wares for nearly fifty years. Here, in just a few pac-es, you can go from getting your palms read to gorging\nyourself on steaming hot pierogi. A more recent addition to the ever-changing array of food stalls, Picante\nLatino is a small venture, positioned in the heart of the\nmarket which sells a range of Ecuadorian dishes alongside other Latin American favourites.\nWe started with the national dish of Ecuador, an\nencebollado \u2013 a fish stew made with tuna, onion,\nyuca and a variety of spices and herbs. Famed by many\nas a miraculous hangover cure, I can confirm that a\nhangover is not necessary to appreciate this warming\nbroth. Light and fragrant, the pickled onions give the\nbowl an acidity which effectively cuts through the\nmeatiness of the tuna. It was served with fried plantain\nchips and, interestingly, plain popcorn \u2013 both of which\nadd some texture to the dish. If it isn\u2019t already evident\nfrom the accompanying photos, the portion size was\nimpressive for the price (\u00a39). This was a bowl which I\nhave little doubt could cure much more severe ailments\nthan a simple hangover.\nWe also tried the Argentinean style asado (\u00a313). The\ndish consists of steak sliced thinly, completely covered\nin chimichurri (a bright green salsa made of parsley,\nchilli and garlic) and served alongside rice, yuca and\na fresh salad. This one was a firm favourite. Sliced so\nthin, the steak surprisingly played a supporting role to\nthe chimichurri, which was bright and flavoured the\naccompanying rice. The yuca was also a great addition,\nproviding another blank canvas to cover with the salsa-covered steak. Steak is often a rich and heavy food, but\nthe combination of the chimichurri and the fresh and\nslightly acidic salad made this dish feel more delicate\nthan it had any right to be.\nWe were also told to try the bol\u00f3n de verde\n(literally \u2018big green ball\u2019). This is a deep-fried ball of\ngreen plantain, stuffed with cheese and, in our case,\nchicharrones. It was served alongside that same fresh\nsalad with an acidic red onion bite and a small dish\nof aj\u00ed, a chilli sauce. The aj\u00ed was thick and didn\u2019t have\na particularly strong tang, so we quickly covered the\nbol\u00f3n with every drop. This is pure comfort food, plain\nand simple, and perfectly scratched that deep-fried itch\nafter such fresh and light dishes.\nDue to the intimate nature of the stall - with just\na few small tables and chairs to sit at - I was able to\nchat with the owner and chef, an Ecuadorian woman\ncalled Ninfa. Ninfa is clearly loved in the area, with our\nconversation frequently halted as a passer-by greeted\nher and she shouted back with a smile. Put simply, it\nwas clear to me in the short time that we spent there\nthat she is one of the most lovely and warm human\nbeings you could hope to meet. The size of the stall is\nsomething worth noting - although I\u2019m certain you\ncould use the tables of adjacent stalls, Picante Latino\ndoesn\u2019t have seating for a very large group.\nFinally, we watched as Ninfa peeled back the corn\nhusk on a humita (\u00a32.50). Humitas are much like\nan Ecuadorian version of tamales - although slight\nvariations on humitas also exist in many other Andean\ncountries. They consist of fresh corn ground into a\npaste and combined with cheese, encased in a corn\nhusk, and boiled or steamed - in Ecuador they are often\neaten at breakfast. At Picante Latino it was served with\nanother small dish of aj\u00ed and a large mug of black coffee\nfor that authentic breakfast feeling at 6 p.m. Is this not\nessentially just cornflakes with added chilli? These were\nsimple but delicious, and Ninfa told us that she sells\nout of them every day.\nAll this was eaten leisurely whilst sipping a glass of\ncolada morada (\u00a32.50) \u2013 a vibrant purple drink served\nhot or cold (in this case cold) made of a selection of\nfruits and berries, purple corn powder and warming\nspicessuchascinnamonandcloves.ThiswasChristmas\nin a glass, and I\u2019m sure it tastes even more like distilled\nfestive cheer when warm. The reasonably large chunks\nof pineapple which filled the glass also made this drink\nfeel quite substantial. Amongst an impressive selection\nof dishes, this first-time try will definitely stick in my\nmind.\nThe same can be said for the batido de aguacate\n(\u00a32.50)\u2013atall,mutedgreenglassofavocadomilkshake.\nWhenthiswasfirstrecommendedtousbyourculinary\ntour guide, I was far from convinced. In reality, it turns\nout that avocado, milk, and sugar blended together\ntastes exactly like you would expect \u2013 creamy, sweet,\nand avocado flavoured. If you like avocado as much as I\ndo, you\u2019ll enjoy this; if not, it won\u2019t win you over.\nPicante Latino, tucked away in the small but\ncharming Nag\u2019s Head Market, is a true gem of North\nLondon. The food was excellent and the prices were\nvery reasonable for the truly impressive portion sizes.\nThe service was also some of the best I\u2019ve ever had,\nmaking us all feel like we could return just to chat\nwith the owner for longer. I would wholeheartedly\nrecommend this spot to anyone passing through the\narea - just remember to tell Ninfa that I sent you and\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a warm greeting.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n14 Food.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nPicante Latino - Ecuadorian Oasis\nRestaurant Review\nWritten by Alex Dadswell Food Writer\nFood\n\n"

It was secured through\nthe hard work of applied\nentomologist James Watson\nMunno. He established the\npark as a world centre for\nthe study of insect control.\nThe equipment of these\nearly days was inventive and\nrudimentary: Wellington\nbomber engine-heaters were\ntransformed into fans by Drs Page and Lubatti to make controlled environment\ncabinets. Researchers at the International Application Research Centre\n(IPARC), who made ultra low volume applicators, were affectionately known as\n\"nozzleheads\". The arrival of John Kennedy and Tony Lees hugely furthered the\ncentre with their research on insect flight and photoperiodism.\nThe study of theoretical ecology prospered after the appointmnet of M. P.\nHassell in 1971, and his collaborations with R. M. May and R. M. Anderson, who\nstudied infectious disease modelling and dynamics. Mick Crawley revolutionised\nplant ecology with field studies and experimental models.\nBy the 1980s, Silwood Park had started to shift from primarily applied\nentomology to ecology and evolution. This had begun with insects in the 1950s\nand 1960s with the work of Dick Southwood and Michael J. Way, who studied\ninsect communities in grasslands, trees, shrubs, and insects in plant succession.\nIn the 1990s, entomology made a bit of a comeback with Austin Burt's work.\nHe wrote about site-specific selfish genes as tools for controlling and genetically\nengineering populations, which was the origin of Imperial College's current\nproject to eliminate malaria mosquitos.\nHISTORY OF RESEARCH AT SILWOOD PARK\nFUTURE OF SILWOOD PARK\nProfessor Armand Leroi, academic lead\nfor the 75th anniversary celebrations,\nsays that Silwood is and will remain\nstrongly engaged in societal problems\nsuch as pathogens and climate change. Research is increasingly able to shape\nlife and the environment rather than passively study it, informing policies\nand technologies that can be implemented for human and environmental\nprotection.\nLast year, the Georgina Mace Centre for the Living Planet was launched.\nThis centre is direcrted by Professor Vincent Savolainen and dedicated to\nproducing science-based solutions to environmental problems.\nThe Leverhulme Centre for the Holobiont, headed by Professor Tom Bell,\nis planned for Autumn 2022. This centre will focus on microbial-multicellular\nrelationships.\n75th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS\nSilwood Park's 75th\nanniversary celebrations\nwill include a Georgina Mace Centre Biodiversity\nDebate, Bugs Birds & Bees family-friendly day of\ncelebration, and Sir Ernst Chain lecture, amongst\nother exciting events!

The Rwanda plan had, in its early stages,\nbeen absolutely golden. As shown by the Johnson\ngovernment\u2019s continued, soaring popularity ratings,\nwhenever a rough patch is hit, the best thing to do is\nto announce a policy that appeases a tiny, xenophobic\nportion of the population and attract almost universal criticism in the press. In terms of this approach,\npermanently deporting Channel migrants to Rwanda\nwas top bins.\nHow hair-wrenching it was for the Home Office,\nthen, when UK standards fell to the point that there\nwas no discernible difference between the UK and\nRwanda on paper.\nPriti glanced up at the whiteboard where all the\nnegatives that had been listed about the central African nation had slowly been crossed off over the last\nfew weeks. \u201cCorrupt government\u201d had sort of been put\nup ironically to begin with, but media coverage of the\nUK\u2019s covid contract procurement, suspicious cessation\nof MET investigations and the so-called Advisory Board\nhad made it a bit too real, and it was rubbed off.\nEveryone thought \u201cshortage of food and basic\nessentials\u201d was a safe one, but next week\u2019s rail strikes\nlook set to leave shelves as barren as the rail tracks\nthemelves.\nSomehow, even the \u201cuncomfortably warm climate\u201d\npoint that wasn\u2019t even really a serious one anyway has\nsomehow been matched by this week\u2019s encroaching\nheatwave.\nRwandan President Kagame\u2019s eagerness towards\nthe plan, which he touted as a solution to the issue\nof swathes of young men leaving the country, was\nmet with nervous glances from across the Cabinet, as\npapers titled \u2018job vacancy crisis\u2019 and \u20181.3 million empty\nroles\u2019 were hastily hidden away.\nThe saving grace of the plan was that, just before\nit was cancelled, the flight was set to carry just four\nmigrants to Rwanda, keeping alive the Tory tradition\nof sinking eye-watering sums into unpopular projects\nwhilst making cuts to services that help people.\nThe plan must be kept alive, and a quick WhatsApp\nto Deputy PM and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab\ndid just that and more. What to do when the plane is\ngrounded by the European Court of Human Rights?\nWe change the law so the UK can ignore the European\nCourt of Human Rights. It was so simple. So unbureau-cratic. So sensicle. And what\u2019s more, it lays excellent\nprecedent for the UK to change the law so it can ignore\nits *own* laws whenever they cause a spot of bother\nfor the government. With this sort of quick thinking,\nmigrants will be hurtling over to sunny Rwanda in no\ntime.\n\n"

However, by March the show\nhad faced its first delay, with the opening put back to\nOctober 2020. Before then, two successive delays to\nMarch and then July 2021 dampened expectations\nthat theatre-goers could see the spectacle (now with an\noriginal song pre-released) in the year after it\u2019s planned\nopening.\nIt was in June 2021 that Webber had seemingly had\nenough, insisting that he was to open the show at full\ncapacity and, when asked what he would do if the government were to postpone the Covid reopening, \u201cwe\nwill say: \u2018come to the theatre and arrest us.\u2019\u201d But, that\ndid not happen. After a member of the cast tested positive for Covid the press night was cancelled and Cinderella forbidden, once again, to go to the ball. It was\nonly by the 18th\nof August, over a year after it\u2019s orignal-ly scheduled opening, that the show finally opened to\ncritics (receiving some of the best reviews of any new\nmusical and, as Webber would later say, some of the\nbest of his career).\nUnfortunately, the Omicron Covid wave put a stop\nto any Christmas and New Year performances (usual-ly a busy time for the arts), and Cinderella was closed\nagain until February 2022.\nAfter only a few months of shows, on the 1st\nof May\nthis year Cinderella\u2019s closure was announced via social\nmedia - largely expected to be a long-running fixture\nof the West End, the costs and impracticalities of running a show during Covid ultimately proved its ruin.\nWhilst we may be surprised at a distance, some of the\ncast purportedly only found of the show\u2019s cancellation\non Twitter, slamming the show\u2019s creators and organisers for the lack of respect at what had been a very trying\ntime for the industry.\nIn summary, on the closing night, Webber thanks\nthe cast and crew and, in amongst the words extolling\nthe cast, crew and creatives -- wonders if it was not all\na costly mistake.\nCinderella - a sure fire hit\nto a costly mistake?\nAlex Jackson Arts Editor\nWhat\u2019s coming up?\n...and get involved!\nOTVETKAby Neda Nezhdana.\nAvailable from the 30th May on the Finborough\nTheatre YouTube channel.\n\u201cThis war is not just on territory but inside us all.\nCities being bombed, yes, but the brain is bombed even\nmore.

Below are just a few examples of the longer-term field studies that Silwood Park has\naccomodated over the last 75 years. Now, the age of genomics has allowed research at Silwood to span all levels of biological organisation, from genes to ecosystems.\nCURRENT RESEARCH AT SILWOOD PARK\n96 artificial ponds (mesocosms)\nsit teeming with life. They will help\nus to assess the impacts of warming,\ndrought and chemical pollution in\nfreshwater systems by studying all\nlevels of biological organisation. In\n2018 long-term warming experiments\nbegan that match climate projects\nfrom 1\u00baC to 8\u00baC warming. Periods of\nextreme warming designed to mimic\nsheat waves are applied. In 2019\nchemical stressors were added so that\nthe impact of multiple stressors and\ntheir interaction could be studied.\nPond mesocosms\nSeed germination and survival is\na key factor to the composition of\nplant communities. Disturbances to\nseeds affect the relative abundance of\nplant species. Established in 1991 by\nMick Crawley, this project assesses\nthe effect of timing of cultivation and\nsoil disturbances on grassland biomass\nand species composition. Different\nplant communities have resulted from\ndifferent cultivation treatments, with\nspecies abundance increasing with\ncultivation methods that favours their\nseedlings most.\nPhenology is the study of the\ncyclic and seasonal timing of natural\nphenomena. The rearing of blue tit\nchicks is synchronised with the peak in\nabundance of their food: caterpillars.\nCaterpillar abundance is synchronised\nwith the emergence of oak buds, on\nwhich they feed. The timing of these\nevents are being disturbed by changes\nin climate and environmental cues.\nAs these processes rely on different\ncues, there can be a mismatch in the\nphenology of these interacting species.\nSince 2002, this mismatch has been\nrecorded and studied by investigating\noak bud emergence, caterpillar\nabundance and blue tit chick rearing.\nSince 1968, the suction trap at\nSilwood Park has caught aphids for\nthe study of insect populations. It\nis one of 16 in the UK used for the\nRothasmsted Insect Survey.

    "content": "The next time you walk along a busy\nroad in London, have a look at\nthe traffic alongside you \u2013 not just for\nroad safety, but to observe the kinds\nof vehicles that are present. At least in\nSouth Kensington, the vast majority\nof those vehicles are likely to be private\ncars, which begs the question of just\nhow many greenhouse gases (GHGs)\nare being pumped into London\u2019s air at\nany given moment.\nI have a personal vendetta against\ncars, as I get horrible motion sickness,\nparticularly on long drives. I would\ngladly take a train or bus over a car any\nday. But that is beside the point \u2013 the\nreal issue here is that of climate change,\nand specifically the GHG emissions that\ncontribute to it.\nFor someone from Hong Kong, a\ncity that relies heavily on its public\ntransport system, it is incredible that a\ncity as well-established as London does\nnot have efficient and affordable public\ntransport. Understandably, the infrastructure is much older than many comparable Asian cities, but with the endless\nrail works carried out at all times in London, one would think the government\nwould invest in a full revamp of the underground system. Hong Kong has its\nfair share of private vehicles, but public\ntransport is reliable and cheap enough\nthat car owners often opt for taking buses and trains instead.\nThere are many reasons why people\nmight choose not to utilise London\u2019s\npublic transport. First of all, there are\nthe extortionate prices, which put off\nmany students and people from lower income households. This, combined\nwith numerous delays and erratic train\ntimings, makes travelling by private car\nor foot much more efficient. The weekly train strikes and rail works make the\ntrains and tube unpredictable; a nightmare for commuters who travel at peak\ntimes. Many visitors to London from\nother parts of the UK will drive into\nthe city rather than pay for an expensive train ticket, adding more vehicles to\nthe already congested roads. This heavy\ntraffic makes buses slower than most\nother forms of transportation, so that\nalthough they are the cheapest mode of\ntransport,theyareunfavourableforpeo-ple who actually want to arrive at their\ndestination on time.\nNot only are private cars a big issue,\nbut so is the use of private jets, particularly by the wealthiest 1% of the population and by public figures such as\ngovernment officials and celebrities. The\nemissions for private aircraft are not sig-nificantlyhigherthanthoseforcommer-cial flights, but the emissions per person\nare. The same goes for private cars - one\nbus emits more CO2 than one car, but\nwhen comparing a full bus to the equivalent number of private cars the bus emits\nsignificantly less.\nAccording to the UK Government\u2019s\n\u2018Transport and Environmental Statistics\u2019 for Autumn 2021, indirect emissions (meaning emissions produced\nfrom resource extraction, production,\nand fuel transport) comprise roughly\na quarter of private cars\u2019 emissions. By\ncomparison, indirect emissions only account for about a sixth of total emissions\nfor trains, coaches, and planes (although\nplanes cause other negative environmental effects). This indicates that the manufacture of private vehicles alone already\ncreates a significant level of emissions.\nThis leads onto the matter of electric\ncars and how they contribute to GHG\nemissions. While fully electric cars do\nnot produce any direct emissions, hybrid models do, and both kinds produce\nsignificant levels of indirect emissions.\nThese indirect emissions come from a\nnumber of different sources; much are\nfrom the manufacturing process, as well\nas importation, waste disposal, and pro-ducingthenecessaryenergytochargethe\nbattery. Unless this electricity is sourced\npurely from renewables, the burning of\nfossil fuels will contribute further emis-sions. The manufacture of the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries generally used\nin these cars is environmentally-damag-ing too; GHG emissions and water loss\noccur during the lithium extraction pro-cess, and disposal of the batteries creates\ntoxic waste. All this goes to show that\neven the most environmentally-friendly\nprivate vehicles have their drawbacks.\nHowever, electric vehicles are still\nmore energy efficient during operation,\nespecially if the electricity comes from\nrenewable sources, and many countries\nare introducing electric buses in place\nof petrol-fuelled ones in an attempt to\nfurther reduce the direct emissions produced by public transport.\nThis would be a feasible solution for\nthe UK if there were not a number of\nbarriers to implementing it. These include the age and costs of public transport\u2019s current infrastructure, the fact\nthat many people still need to own a\nprivate vehicle for family or work pur-poses, and how to appropriately dispose\nof the old vehicles. There are also the\nsocioeconomic implications of banning\nprivate cars, in terms of the rights to sell\nand own particular products. The motor\nindustry is well-established, and many\nof its customers are used to living with\naccess to their own car. Privately-owned\ncars and jets could potentially be repurposed into public vehicles such as taxis\nand short-haul commercial airlines, but\nthe economic viability of this is another\nmajor factor against its implementation.\nI believe that the UK Government\nshould at least attempt to start phasing\nout private cars, or to limit and regulate\ntheir ownership. While this would be\na slow process, it would be highly beneficial for the future of society and the\nplanet. There are so many alternatives \u2013\nbuses, trains, taxis (or Ubers), trams, bicycles \u2013 that could be optimised in order\nto render private cars obsolete. It would\nalso set an example for other developed\ncountries such as the US, Japan, and\nGermany, which have varying degrees of\npublic transport efficiency, but all have\nhigh levels of private car ownership.\nThis may sound like a drastic measure,\nbut we are living through the most critical period in humanity\u2019s history, with\nseemingly little remorse for the impact\nwe are having on the Earth. Should that\nnot warrant a few drastic measures?\nThe UK Government Should Phase\nOut Private Vehicle Ownership\nAs we look to the future, private cars should become a thing of the past.\nBooksEditor\nZannaBuckland\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n16 Comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment Have an article in mind?\nEmail your idea or piece to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPhoto credits: Cheung Yin on Unsplash, Clive Kim on Pexels\nHong Kong road vs London road\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 17TH MAY 2022\n13\nBOOKS\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStone\u2019s Fall opens in 1953 Paris, where an aged Britishreporterisattendingadrizzlyfuneralforawom-an he hasn\u2019t seen in many years. He is approached by a\nlawyer, who explains that he is the keeper of a package\nthat was only to be bestowed the reporter upon the\nwoman\u2019s death, and so begins a tale of love, murder and\nespionage.\nWritten by Iain Pears, Stone\u2019s Fall is a relatively long\nnovel at 600 pages of small print, and it took me just\nover a month to read, on and off. I only mention this\nfact because the\nbook\u2019s format\nmakes crosslinking\nthings you learn\nin the first few\npages with events\non page 500 quite\nimportant, and at\ntimes this becomes\na bit of a stretch.\nThe novel takes the reader back in time from 1953\nto 1867 through three different perspectives. The accounts tell the story of\nthe rise and eventual fall\nof John Stone; munitions\nmagnate and industrial gi-ant, starting at his untimely death and culminating\nin the formative years of\nhis 20s.\nEach part of the story is\ntold from the perspective\nof a different person. To\nbegin with, a 20-some-thing man who has almost\neverything to learn about\nthe world, and whose direction in life becomes\ncompletely swayed by any\nforthright woman, seduc-tress or otherwise.\nOne way in which\nStone\u2019s Fall sets itself apart\nfrom other historical fictions is through its inclusion of a female lead who\nis far more interesting,\ncomplicated, and pivotal\nthan any of the male char-acters. Elizabeth Stone\n(Lady Ravenscliffe), is\nintroduced as the wife\nof the recently deceased\nJohn at the beginning of\nthe book. Over 20 years\nhis junior, what is initially assumed to be a classic\ngold-digging relationship\nexpands into an abstruse\nstory that began before\nElizabeth was even born.\nThe first lead is Times crime reporter Matthew Braddock, who is hired by Lady Ravenscliffe to investigate\nthe death of her husband, which until this point had\nbeen ruled unsuspicious by the police. Though Braddock is still relatively green and knows next to nothing\nabout investigative work or the intricate workings of\nthe financial machines that Stone sat at the helm of, it\nquickly becomes apparent that there is more to Stone\u2019s\ndeath than meets the eye.\nPeriod details are plastered throughout the novel -financiers express their outrage at the idea of income\ntax being raised to 5%, rent in London is \u00a31 a week,\nand the comparative laxity in regulation of the financial markets in the past is laid bare. Descriptions of the\nstate of London in the early 19th\nand 20th\ncenturies is\nenough to make the reader glad that the days of street\nurchins and ubiquitous vagrancy are (mostly) behind\nus.\nPerhaps a hundred pages before the end, I found myself wondering why Pears had even bothered inverting\nthe order in which events were told, as it didn\u2019t seem\nto add any distinctive traits, and made the story significantly harder to follow. Rest assured, I ate my words\nby the finale. As with all the best mysteries, when the\ncrucial plot point finally fell into place, the reader finds\nthemselves putting the book down and simply gawping\nas the revelation sinks in.\nStone\u2019s Fall - An Erudite Mystery\nBook Review\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\n\u201c\nTAKES THE\nREADER BACK\nIN TIME FROM\n1953 TO 1867\n\u201c\nONE WAY IN WHICH\nSTONE\u2019S FALL SETS ITSELF\nAPART FROM OTHER\nHISTORICAL FICTIONS\nIS THROUGH ITS\nINCLUSION OF A FEMALE\nLEAD\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cThe end of the line is just the beginning\u2026\u201d\nPeace is in the answer (somewhere, somewhat).\nAnd Power\u2122 is the vice. By the end of the self-ti-tled \u201cbiopunk psychedelic\u201d or psychedelic-punk thrill-er, peace\u2014as an idea or literary quality\u2014is lost in the\nspace between the numerous analogies that author\nProto Dagg uses to dream up a world of pervasive ad-diction, which he does soon after awakening from. An\nevent-driven roundtable of action, visions, hallucina-tions, love interests, more action, and more visions, is\nwhat carries Terminus, but what\nit needs to elevate its harder-thought-of thoughts alongside\nits peers is some literary scaf-folding, or a greater sense of its\nown system.\nTerminusissetinatitularcity\nwhere an addiction to Power (a\ndrug; tangible, and probably\ntrademarked) is abundant and highly prevalent (like\nan American opioid epidemic). However, Proto Dagg\ndoes not spell out the roots and germinations of a true\naddiction \u2014 \u201cI mean, everyone is addicted to something\u201d \u2014 that he then goes on to muse about, nearly\nenough. This philosophising is exemplified by \u201cwe all\nwant something; some just want it more than others\u201d.\nAnd thus, at times and in many ways, Terminus is far\nfromrootedintruereality,outsideofitsownornamen-tal descriptions of life.1\n\u201cAddiction is such an ugly word,\u201d begins a now-in-famous energy drink account manager, Power addict,\nand the YA protagonist Matt. Matt meets the energetic\nPriya one night at a nightclub peddling Peace (anoth-er drug (excessive?); this one not trademarked). And\nas his designated potential love interest, Priya is writ-ten, and fated to entangle him in\nthe typical lengthy antics of any\nYoung Adult novel focused on\nsystem subversion, things like war,\nlike revolution, and, of course, like\nlove.\nAnd, largely, he succeeds in doing this.

Terminus, in summa-ry, should come with a cautionary label for oncoming\nreaders: \u201crequires patience - and a handful of tolerance\n-foritszealousintentions\u201d,althoughitatleastbearsthe\nsweet fruit of ambition, and a singular vision.\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nTerminus: A Book That\nCould Do Better\nBook Review\nFiyinfoluwa Timothy Books Writer\n\u201c\nIT AT LEAST BEARS\nTHE SWEET FRUIT\nOF AMBITION, AND\nA SINGULAR VISION\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nVirginia Woolf does this, Joseph Conrad does this\n\u2014Sylvia Plath, Flanner O\u2019Connor, Gustave Flaubert, and Enid Blyton have all done this. These are examples of writers I have read in the last ten months, (or,\nfor Enid Blyton, in the last ten years).\nBlack identity, both in the physical and social sense,\nis often used as a prop in literature. It seems in this case\nthat Proto Dagg is keen on utilising imagery from our\nworld - this reality, consisting of religious systems, peo-ple, cultures, and places - to create a creased backdrop\nfor the fictional world of Terminus with its futuristic\ncars and hyper-urban buildings.\nTake this sentence: \u201cWhen the drug hit streets, it\nswept through the city like a tsunami, taking the young\nand old, black and white, rich and poor.\u201d\nThere are instances - including the character strangely named \u201cRasta Man\u201d - when things an author writes\nare obscured or exposed by the mind that writes them.\nThe specific use of Black people to demonstrate the\nubiquitous nature of a drug is unqualified here. I can\nonly hope that some of this rhetoric, which is common\nto the writers I have previously stated, is down to plain\nignorance, a misguided attempt at thought-provoking-ness,orjustpoorwriting.In Terminus,Iextendenough\ngraceto(hopefully)believeitisthelatterofthesethree,\na symptom of the White gaze that still persists in the\nfield of Literature.\nThe portrayal of women is a whole other story, and\none in which evidence of such in what is a brief foot-note, should serve no purpose to embarrass the author.\nThat is not my intention. A work must make a case for\nitself, alongside personal interpretations. And what\nTerminus says, with its many desperate fixations on the\nfemale body corrupting its much finer prose, is not en-couraging. It is instead unfortunate, a symptom of, this\ntime, a pernicious male gaze.\nOn the matter of reality, the act of reading feels like\nwalking into an empty room. The depiction of characters is often representative of the lens through which an\nauthor writes and sees the world. Sometimes you may\nwalk into a room of what seems like cardboard cut-outs. Sometimes the room feels like there is an organic\nverisimilitude with which the writer approaches even\nthe tiniest character. It comes down to how the author\napproaches the world around them, and whether they\nhold a perspective with or without a common dignity.\n[1] A BRIEF FOOTNOTE: ON THE MATTER OF REALITY\n\n"
