There will be some esp ece de sight-seeing trip before\nthe performance, and we\nshould get back well before\nclosing tim w. Not that that\nhas anything to do with it, of\ncourse.

When difficult material is encountered for the first time,\nthis must be expected, unless\none takes the trouble to read up\non it beforehand. The lectures\nmay then become more\ninteresting! ( Unless, of course,\nthe student has no interest in\nhis/ her subject anyway; in\nwhich case he really has no\nbusiness at Imperial College, being bored to death at public\nexpense.)\nWhat perhaps galls many\nstudents is that mastering a scientific or engineering\nsubject at an advanced level\nrequires hard work and long\nhours of study. There are very\nfew short cuts, but nice, easy\nshort cuts are exactly what\nBritain' s pampered youth\nwant. Instead, they are given\nworksheets (problem sheets)\nwhich actually require them to\nwork!\nI think the basic trouble\nstems from the fact that\nmany, perhaps a majority,\nof the students here have\nno strong motivation for\nstudying their subject, or\neven for being at university.\nFew sixth-former s choose\na university course out of a strong desire to study that\nparticular subject, and even\nfewer bother to find out what\nstudying that subject at\nuniversity would entail. In\nthese circumstances boredom is hardly unexpected, and while\nthe presentation of lectures\nwould certainly be a good\nthing, it will not solve the\nproblem.\nYours sincerely\nL SHAYNE Maths 3\n\n"

This figure includes 2.6% of those\ncontacted who failed to reply.\nThe figure of 10.1% (for 1975)\ncompares with 7.8% in 1974,\n11.9% in1973 and 10.9% in1972. The feedback to departments\ncareers advisors on job offers\nand acceptances registered by\nprospective graduates suggest\nno marked change from previous\nyears.\nPost Grad AGM\nRICHARD PARKER, currently\nICU A AO, was elected as Chairman of the Post Graduate\nGroup at their AGM on Wednesday.

The Group will be looking for\nmore representation for PG s at a departmental level, a far\nmore worthwhile aim in Mr\nParker's views. From this, he hopes that\ninter-der/art mental links can be\ndeveloped and strengthened.\nThe Group will also be\nlooking into ways of making\nmore contact with MSc students\nwho seem to be out on a limb within the Group.\nThey are at present awaiting\nthe report of the working\nparty looking into PG studies\nand will base some of their\nactivities around any concrete\nsuggestions that emerge from\nit.\nNat West expands\nNATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK LIMITED is pleased to\nannounce that the enlargement\nof the Sub-Branch premises in\nImperial College is due to\ncommence on Monday 7th June.\nThe work is expected to take\napproximately three months,\nfinishing by the end of August.\nIt is envisaged however, that\nsome inconvenience will be\nfelt, not only by the Staff of the\nBranch, but by all customers\nand the Bank would like to\ntake this opportunity of\na polo gi sing beforehand for any\ndiscomfort suffered.\nDuring alterations, which\neventually will provide more\namenable conditions both sides\nof the counter, the Branch WILL remain open. Of the services to be made available in the\nnew premises a Cash Dispensing machine will be installed and\nthose customers wishing to\nprepare for this service are\ninvited to apply for the\nnecessary cards before hand.\nAny customers wishing to\navoid the works area may make\nother arrangements to cash\ntheir cheques and Bob Bain bridge will be happy to discuss details with them, although it\nis sincerely hoped that such,\nextremes will not be necessary\nand that the inconvenience\nwill be minimal.\nTHE NUS this week stepped\nup its campaign to get\n15,000 trained teachers into\nemployment in schools in\nEngland and Wales. NUS headquarters, at Endsleigh\nStreet, is acting as an\nemergency campaign machine,\nhandling what NUS President\nCharles Clarke described as \"the biggest and most\nimportant campaign NUS has ever mounted'.\"\n101 colleges of education\nand two universities, HeriotWatt and Glasgow, are at\npresent in occupation because\nof the issue of unemployed\nteachers. The occupations,\nwhich began in Scotland a few\nweeks ago, involve all14,000 trainee teachers in Scotland,\nand are not expected to end in the foreseeable future.\nWell attended. meetings of\nthe students unions involved\nhave preceded all the occupations (1600 at Jordon hill, Glasgow). The occupations\nhave brought teacher training\nto a standstill in Scotland.\nOnly necessary activities\nsuch as Teaching practice\nexaminations and payment of\nstaff wages have been allowed to continue.\nThe militant response from\ncolleges of education has met\nwith solid backing from the\nNUS Executive. Campaign\nplans announced for this\nmonth will cost an estimated\n\u00a36000, and over the next two\nweeks raising money for NUS's fighting fund will be a major\nactivity. Trade unions and\nstudent unions a like are being\nasked to help with the necessary\nfinancial aid for the campaign.\nThe man in charge of the\n\" action desk\" at NUS Headquarters is NUS Deputy\nPresident, Alastair Stewart.\n\"/ have never known a response\nlike this to an NUS call to\naction. Thousands of trained\nteachers will be on the dole\nat a cost of 55% of what it\nwould cost to employ them.\nEven the Government must\nsoon see how ridiculous, and\nhow embittering this is.\",\nhe says.\nIn addition, unemployment\ninformation desks are to be\nset up in each SU in the\ncountry. The numbers of new\ngraduates unemployed this year\nwill be collected and sent to\nNUS, who hope to release full\nfigures on graduate unemployment by June 14.\nIn an attempt to increase\npublic awareness of graduate\nunemployment, leaflets, posters,\nand a specially \u2014 prepared\ntabloid-style broadsheet are\nbeing prepared. The latter\nshould be ready for distribution\nto students next week. This forms the backbone of a campaign to get the facts and\nfigures about graduate unemployment across to all sections of the student\ncommunity. MPs will be\nlobbied as will be the TUC Special Conference on June 16.\nReaction to the campaign\nhas so far been favourable,\nsaid NUS Press Officer\nFrancis Beckett.\nThe campaign continues\ntomorrow with a National\nConference of delegates from\nColleges of Education and\neducation departments at\nManchester Polytechnic. The conference will discuss the\ncampaign and the decisions made for continuing it made\nby the NUS Executive. This will be followed by public\nmeetings from 7\u201411 June in five major cities: Glasgow(7 th), Manchester (8th), Sheffield (9th), Cardiff (10th) and Birmingham (1 Ith).\nThe massive programme of\npublic meetings and demonstrations culminates in what is likely to be the biggest\nnational demonstration called by NUS on June 15th.

    "content": "mix3 NUS Response to the Grants\nAnnouncement 1976/77\nDiscretionary Awards\nThe Grants announcement on Thursday 27th May did nothing for discretionary awards except to clarify that one\ncourse at one College did not merit a mandatory award. More than half the members of NUS receive no awards\nat all or less than full value awards because of the discretionary powers of local authorities. The normal\nexcuse prof erred by the DES for doing nothing on discretionary awards, apart from the usual public expenditure\nconsiderations, is the lack of legislative time. On this occasion there was no such excuse. The Education\nBill1975, the Comprehensive Bill, is currently going through the House. Clause 7 of that Bill extends\nthe range of designated courses to include the new higher diplomas of the Technical Education Council& the Business Education Council. Hi is was a golden opportunity to extend mandatory provision still further to include all courses of advanced further education & to make proper financial provision for the 16-19 age\ngroup, this Government's so called educational priority. Nothing has been done & once again increases in the main rate of grant have been used to mask a totally inadequate & unjust settlement for the majority of\nour members.\nThe Means Test The Means Test stays virtually unchanged for another year. The DES have tampered with the base of the means\ntest scale raising it from \u00a32200 to \u00a32700. But improvements in the base will do nothing to help the\nmajority of students whose parents earn in excess of \u00a34000. For parents above that level, the contribution has been reduced by only \u00a320 & that is assuming that parental income remains static, which is of course\nunlikely. This can only mean that the 57% of students now shown not to receive all or part of their contribution will be added to as the means test burden grows heavier. In the decade 1962 to 1972, the average value of\nthe student maintenance grant paid by local authorities has risen by only 27% whereas the average parental contribution has risen by 139%. This settlement will continue that trend. The fact that the settlement has\ncost \u00a330m, an increase on the previous grants bill of only 11% suggests that much of the cost of the settlement\nwill come from the parents' pocket not the Government's. There has been no alteration in the age of independance. Married students continue to be assessed on their spouse's income or worse still their parents. The concession granted on the three years earning rule which\nwill mean that periods of time spent at home caring for children will count as self support, for the purpose\nof establishing independance, will apply to married students only, not to unmarried students. This is appalling discrimination against the unmarried.\nThe Main Rate\nThe main rate of grant has been increased from \u00a3740 to \u00a3875. On t lie face of it this looks to be more than\nmight have been expected in the light of the Government's current pay policy. Closer inspection does not bear\nout this first impression. We calculated that students needed a minimum of \u00a3845 last September if they were to\nhave enough to cover their basic needs. An award of \u00a3875 in September 1976, twelve months later, goes no way\nto meet that need. We asked for a grant that would meet costs in the middle of the academic year for which it is paid. Instead this settlement takes little account of the inflation we have already seen this academic year. Inflation in March still stood at 21%. An increase of 18% in a totally inadequate grant of \u00a3740 coupled with a heavier means test burden can only mean even further reduced living standards for students next year. The\nwhole main rate settlement suggests a naive belief in the Government'santi inflation policy and its optimistic belief that inflation will be down to single figures in February of next year.\nThe new arrangements for vacation support will also have an impact on the student's spending power. The nR S are not going to publish any breakdown of the grant but we know that the vacation element will be in the region\nof \u00a311.35 per week in the short vacations. If we allow for there being eight weeks in the short vacations\nthis puts the total vacation element at \u00a390.80. This means an increase in the term-time grant of 17%. (\u00a3740\nminus \u00a370 (vac element 1975/6) = \u00a3670; \u00a3875 minus \u00a390 (vac ele mnet1976/7)= \u00a3785; an increase of \u00a3115 or17%.) The DES will not specify the number of weeks the new vacation element is meant to cover in the short vacations, so students with short vacations of more than eight weeks in total are likely to suffer as a result. There are only two aspects of the settlement which can be welcomed. The full cost of medical insurance for students going abroad as part of their course will now be paid as part of their grant. The relaxing of the\nthree year self support from earnings rule to allow students who have claimed sickness, invalidity or maternity\nbenefit to count those periods as self support should mean that more students than previously will be granted\nindependent status.
