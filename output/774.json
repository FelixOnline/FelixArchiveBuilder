    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday June5 th19872 Death penalty bias\nLouisiana Injustice\nThere has been a sudden and\nworrying upsurge in the number of\nexecutions in the United States.\nSeveral States have-, now resumed\nexecutions, after waiting for the\nlandmark Supreme Court ruling on\nracial discrimination in the case of\nMcCleskey vs Kemp. Louisiana\nintends to put to death six prisoners\nbetween June 7th and 18th, despite\nevidence of racial bias in the\napplication of the death penalty.\nMcCleskey vs Kemp\nWarren McCleskey appealed to the\nUS Supreme Court against his death\nsentence in Georgia on the strength\nof evidence which showed that blacks\nwere far more likely than whites to\nget the death penalty for an equivalent\noffence. The evidence consisted of an\nextensive study by Professor David\nBaldus of Iowa State University in\nwhich he examined the effects of race\non capital sentencing in more than\n2000 homicide cases in the period\n1973-79. He found that defendants\nconvicted of killing white victims\nwere eleven times more likely to get\nthe death sentence than killers of\nblacks.\nThe Supreme Court Decision\nDespite this finding, the Supreme\nCourt ruled with a narrow majority\n(5-4) that the defendant would have\nhad to prove a discriminatory intent\non the part of the court that originally\nconvicted him\u2014an exceptionally\ntough burden of proof. Amazingly the\nSupreme Court did not dispute the\nfindings of Baldus' study and referred\nthem as a matter of interest to the\nState's law-making bodies. The four\njudges who dissented from the\nmajority decision were stunned that\nthe clear 'risk' of racial bias in\nMcCleskey's case was not regarded\nas a relevant factor. Justice Brennan\nwrote \"the risk that race influenced\nMcCleskey's sentence is intolerable,\nby any standards\".\nAmnesty's Concern\nSince there are also reports of racial\ndiscrimination in Louisiana, Amnesty\nInternational is making strenuous\nefforts to appeal for clemency in the\ncases of the six prisoners there.\nAmnesty believes, and rightly, that\nthe process of execution cannot be\npermitted to continue whilst there is\na significant risk that sentences are not\nbeing applied fairly. In any case\nAmnesty is totally opposed to the\ndeath penalty as a cruel, degrading\nand inappropriate punishment.\nWhat You Can Do\nThe gravity of the situation in\nLouisiana calls for swift, effective\naction. You can easily participate in\nthat action by writing to the Governor\nof Louisiana. Simply write a brief,\ncourteous letter expressing your\nconcern at the imminent executions of\nthe six prisoners. It doesn't have to\nbe very long at all\u2014a couple of lines\nwill do. The important thing is that\nthe authorities should be inundated\nwith letters of concern. Amnesty has\nshown time and time again how\neffective letters can be; so please,\nmake the little effort that is\nrequired\u2014even if you do have exams.\nWrite to:\nThe Hon Edwin Edwards\nState Capitol\nBaton Rouge\nLA 70804\nUSA\nIf you would like any more\ninformation on this particular matter\nor on the death penalty in general or\non any of Amnesty International's concerns then don't hesitate to contact\nStephen Curry (Physics, int 6729) or\nSimon Bosher (Physics II).\nStephen Curry\n\u00a322.10 per week\nDear David,\nJust a quick note to highlight the\nimpending destitution which will fall\nupon us in the event of a Conservative\nmajority on June 11th. There now\nfollows a bit of number crunching.\nThe maintenance grant is at present\n\u00a32236.\nNext year we will receive a4% increase, \"in line with inflation\",\ngiving us \u00a32325.44. For our 39 week\nyear, we can allocate \u00a359.60 per\nweek.\nThe average private\naccommodation, within 45 mins\nwalking distance of College, inclusive\nof rates, costs about \u00a337.50 per week,\nper person.\nIf the bill is deployed to prevent\nstudents from being entitled to rent\nrebate, from the 1st Sept, then we will\nbe left with \u00a322.10 per week.\nThat is \u00a322.10 per week to feed,\nclothe and water ourselves; let alone\nbuy books and stationery or even\ngoing out (God forbid!!). Maybe, in\nthe event of poll tax, or even\nlandlords wise ing up to the fact that\nstudents cannot afford to live in their\nexpensive slums anymore, there could\nbe a reduction in the rent. This does\nseem like a good ploy to make us\ndesire student loans, or use our\nparents as crutches.\nSupport Tactical Voting '87 on\nJune 11th. Katie Cook, Biochem II\nClements' last letter\nDear Dave,\nHaving read this last issue of RCS\nBroadsheet (Vol 19 Issue 11) I feel\nit necessary to comment on many of\nthe factual errors contained within it,\nespecially those concerning the RCS\nConstitutions Review Committee\nwhich I have been chairing. The\npresence of the numerous errors quite\nclearly demonstrates that whoever\nwrote the article (it was unfortunately\nanonymous) has made no attempt\nwhatsoever to find out the real facts,\nbut is prepared to write an article\nbased on his own prejudices and\nguesswork.\nTo start with the front page:\n\"Round 2 of the Great Constitutional\nDebate begins June 12th\". This is\ntotal rubbish, since the Review\nCommittee has to report back to Gen\nComm before anything goes to a UGM. The next Gen Comm is on\nJune 15th, and the earliest UGM to\nwhich changes can be put will be the\nsecond of next term, since no serious\nbusiness can be conducted at the\nFreshers' UGM.\nNext, the description of the RCS\nConstitution as an \"unwieldy\nmonster''. If that is true of it scant 16\npages I would like to know the\nauthors's opinion of this multi-volume\nepic of the ICU constitution.\nThe proposed addition of a requirement that the president should\nhave completed 2 years in RCS\nindeed would not affect Clare, next\nyear's president. However, the\nsuggestion that it would have\nprevented Simon, this year's president, being elected is entirely\nfalse, or hadn't the author noted that\nSimon is a3rd year physicist who will\nbe leaving at the end of this year?\nThe position of UGM and Gen\nComm chairman, a proposed new\nofficer post, has not in fact been\napproved by the committee. We\ndiscussed this at great length, and,\nunlike all other changes, failed to\ncome to a unanimous conclusion. We\nthought, though, that wider discussion\nwas warranted and so will suggest this\nto Joint Gen Comm. The matter of a pot for this post also demonstrates the\nauthor's lack of understanding. No\npost in RCS, or ICU even, is awarded\na pot until it has proved its usefulness\nand durability by functioning for at\nleast 3 years, and then the award is\nonly at the discretion of Joint Gen\nComm. As far as the holder of the\npost is concerned this would be\ndecided by Gen Comm, should the\npost be approved. Any changes to the\nRCS constitution, I would like to add,\nhave to be approved by a% majority\nat 2 separate UGMs, so none of these\nchanges will get through without\npopular approval.\nElsewhere in Broadsheet it is\nsuggested that Simon Banton\ngraduated with a3rd from Physics 3\nyears ago. Wrong again, as just about\nanyone will tell you, he got a pass and\ngraduated 2 years ago.\nFinally I would like to make some\ngeneral comments about Clare's editorial. How she can call the cover\nof Not Broadsheet offensive when she\nherself published the not only\noffensive but dangerous AIDS article\nby Julian Moore (Vol 19 Issue 8) is\nbeyond me. Also, I would like to ask\nher how she expects to have an\neffective working relationship with\nSteph Snell and Dave Williams (next\nyear's HJT) when she subjects them\nto vicious personal attacks. I find the\nlack of understanding of human\nnature revealed by this to be among\nthe best reasons I have seen for\nsuggesting that RCS presidents should\nbe 3rd years. Research in FELIX and\nBroadsheet archives has shown that\nnever before has there been a2nd year\npresident.\nIt has, however, been suggested\nthat the editorial in question was not\nactually written by Clare. The\nsignature at the bottom certainly bears\nmore of a resemblance to Dave\nSmedley's earlier in the issue than it\ndoes to Clare's normal signature.\nShould this be the case I would\napologise unreservedly for the\ncomments in the above paragraph,\nand would suggest that the person\nresponsible for such an irresponsible\ndamaging impersonation never be\nallowed to touch Broadsheet again.\nMany thanks for the time you've\nspent reading this.\nYours,\nDave Clemments\nLiquid Assets\nDear Dave,\nThis is not a letter about gays.\nJust before I leave this place, I'd like to ask next year's DP and FELIX\nEditor, through your exalted\ncolumns, what they plan to do with\nthe Union assets, ie the Union Bar,\nSnackbar, and Bookshop/Sportshop.I ask those two because, first, the\nDP is responsible for the running of\nthose assets, and, second, the FELIX\nEditor is responsible for how they are\npublicised/described. I'd like to see\ntheir answers in print to compare\nthem and for the record.\nWith these days of indeterminate\nstudent attitude towards the Union\n(and vice-versa perhaps), and\ndecreasing real money budgets, it\nwould seem a shame to waste those\nassets through insufficient thought\nand communication, or non-constructive criticism.\nYours interested ly, David Pearce, Mining IV\nPS. I do hope that you can find\nroom for this little request amongst\nyour frightfully important FELIX\nnews.\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion FELIX, Friday June 5th198710 Brave New World\nWhose right and whose choice? Paul Rice examines the contradictions implicit in\nAbortion and Embryo Experimentation.\nAs graduates of Imperial College we\nwill exert influence on society not\nleast in those areas related to science.\nThe creative bounds of scientific\nresearch are being challenged by a society that feels increasingly\nthreatened by science's growing\npower. For instance, there was\nintense media interest and public\ndebate last summer centred around the\nPowel Bill, which proposed to make\nembryo experimentation illegal,\nresulting in our MPs voting to\nproduce majorities of over one\nhundred in the bill's favour. These\nmajorities stemmed partly from the\nweak evidence supporting the\nscientific value of experimentation,\nbut also from an instinctive distaste\nfor the arguments of the eugenics\nmovement, which are an integral part\nof the case for human embryo\nexperimentation. No doubt the\nthought of experimental embryos\ngrowing into adult human beings\nweighed heavily upon the minds of\nMPs.\nThe implications of the Powcl Bill\nfor the legal and moral status of the\nhuman foetus, if it had been allowed\nenough time to pass on to the statute\nbook, have not been lost on our more\nforceful advocates of abortion. A leading feminist, writing recently in\nthe Guardian, pointed out, that,\nbanning all human embryo\nexperimentation would be equivalent\nto presenting the embryo with a fully\nhuman right to life, and would nullify\nthe moral force of any law advocating\nabortion. In other words it is\ncontradictory to ban embryo\nexperimentation whilst preserving the\nright to kill the same embryos at much\nlater stages of development. It is this\nconflicting state of affairs that is\nproducing a reassessment of the 1967\nabortion debate which was fought on\nthree grounds; a woman's claim to\nexercise exclusive rights over her own\nbody; the rights of the human foetus;\nthe suffering involved in the birth of\n(unwanted) children with physical or\nmental handicap and in to socially and\npsychologically difficult situations. In\nthe cases involving rape and danger\nto the mother's life abortion had been\npermitted before the 1967 act.\nWe have a significant claim upon\nthe law to respect our bodily integrity.\nIf abortion was to be made illegal,\nthen, the right denied would be the\nability of a woman to prematurely end\na natural state of her body (by\nremoving a foetus from her womb);\na state she shares the responsibility for\ninitiating except in the case of rape.\nThis would undoubtedly form a valid\nright provided that you could show\nthat the foetus itself does not warrant\nany pre-eminent respect over the\nmother's claims.\nThe foetus does not exhibit many\nof our distinctive human attributes,\nincluding the capacity for rational\nthought, but they are part of its nature\nbecause it quite naturally attains them\nas it develops. The human foetus is\ngenetically predetermined to live out\nand experience a unique human life;\nin killing it we are denying it no less\nthan if we killed any other person,\nsimply their only opportunity to\nexperience their life. We award legal\nrights in order to protect and publicly\nindicate respect for those aspects of\nour existence that we value greatly.\nRespect for the human body is but one\nfacet of our respect for human life;\nso much so that it is difficult to\nperceive how a mother can have a moral claim over her child's life or\nbody simply on the grounds of the\nrights she claims over her own body.\nYoa cannot without contradiction\nclaim to be respecting the human\nbody whilst destroying the human\nfoetus.\nThe objection may be raised,\nhowever, that what actually matters\nis not abstract objective respect for\nhuman life but the quality of human\nlife; we cannot expect people to suffer\nfor an abstract concept. Indeed, the\nfoetus need not suffer pain and if\nkilling it is a great moral evil, then,\nwe should see a correspondingly\nsevere degree of human suffering\naccompanying it. One cannot\ncorrelate these two concepts in such\na crude manner although many people\ndo. Murder in which no physical and\nemotional suffering is involved is still\nclearly morally repugnant. However,\nto an extent that would have been\nimpossible in 1967, disturbing\nmedical evidence of the long term\npsychological harm, technically\ntermed post-abortion syndrome, has\nrecently surfaced (1) (2). This is\nstrongly undermining the use of\nabortion as a palliative for other social\nevils. The case for abortion on the\ngrounds of humanitarian compassion\nis being severely damaged. Those\nwho want to see an end to abortion\nstill recognise that much more needs\nto be done to support and protect\nexpectant mothers and mothers with\nyoung children, particularly at work\nbut also in numerous other areas. It\nis difficult to see how these problems\nwill be faced when the blame for them\ncan be so easily placed on the mother\nwith the question; why didn't you\nhave an abortion?\nAs the connection between foetal\nand adult human life continues to be\nreforged, so the concept of abortion\nwill become in crea s in ly repugnant.\nThis process is well under way in the\ndevelopment of ultra-sound scanning,\nthe probable outlawing of embryo\nexperimentation, and our increasingly\ndetailed knowledge of the effects of\nthe experience of life within the womb\non our later human development.\nNevertheless we can effect the pace\nof change in this outlook. As the\ngeneral election approaches we will\nhave an imp or ant opportunity to\ninfluence the views of our future\nlegislature. I suggest that we exert our\ninfluence to hasten the process and to\nprotect the unborn by making our\nopinions known, and using our votes\nfor their future benefit.\nPaul Rice, Maths PG\nReferences:\n(1) Abortion in a Relationship\nContext by Vincent M Rue, in\n'International Review of Natural\nFamily Planning' summer 1985.\n(2) Coming to Terms: Post Abortion\nStress Syndrome by Speckhard &\nSelby, Terry published by Harper &\nRow, 1986.\nUNION BAR\nEND OF TERM\nBASH\nFeaturing:\n-NORMAN & THE NUTBURGERS-STAGE FRIGHT\u2014\n& OTHERS\n(main band to be announced)\nFRIDAY 19th JUNE\nlate bar & cheap drinks\nWATCH THIS SPACE!!\n\n"

    "content": "Features\nThe Great Knock\n& Poll Swindle\nEven before they\nare elected, the\npolitical parties\ntry to rip off Pete\nWilson in this\nsearing expose of\nblatant\nprofiteering\nI rang up the three 'main' party's central\noffices to ask for copies of their\nrespective manifestos. The\nConservatives told me 'with all due\nrespect' that FELIX was not really a newspaper, and I would have to go to\ntheir bookshop and buy a copy. They\nrelented after I pointed out that Imperial\nCollege has a hall of residence in\nWestminster\u2014a Tory marginal\u2014and\nmost students are first time voters. The\nLabour party sent me a free manifesto\nand invited me to some press\nconferences, including one good one on\nthe arts with Billy Bragg and Ben Elton,\nbut they later rang up to say I couldn't go after all. The first time I rang the\nAlliance, they cut me off on their\nswitchboard. I don't know if any of these\nevents are significant.\nThe Tory and Alliance manifestos cost\none pound, while the Labour Party's brochure is a snip at just seventy-five\npence (always assuming you don't pretend to be a jo ma list and get them\nfor free). I cannot see any reason why\nanyone should want to buy them, as their\ncontents have all received a liberal airing\non television over the last two weeks,\nThey all have catchy slogans on their\ncovers: 'The Next Moves Forward',\n'Britain Will Win', and 'Britian\nUnited\u2014the time has come'. The\nAlliance and Labour manifestos are A3\nfolded sheets, while the Tory one\nconsists of two booklets, and comes in\na rather nice plastic wallet.\nYou may be wondering why I have\nspent so long on trivialities: the covers,\nwho said what on the phone etc...this\nis because the contents of all three\nmanifestos are dull, designed only for\nthe party faithful, and TV\ncommentators. This might seem like a sweeping generalisation, and maybe I should be more respectful when talking\nabout the propaganda of those who\nwould govern us for the next four to five\nyears, but there is no escaping it\u2014they\ndo not make good reading.\nThey all start with an introduction.\nThe Conservatives talk of strength and\npride, and a new spirit of enterprise, and\nthen try to convince us that they care an\nawful lot, honest. The Labour party uses\nwords like fair chances, care for all,\nwork for people, and then spend the rest\nof the intra s lagging off the Tories, and,\nto a lesser extent, the Alliance. The\nAlliance, for their part talk about a united Britain, using lots of\nalliterations\u2014confident, compassionate\nand competitive, slag off both the other\nparties in general, and our electoral\nsystem in particular.\nWhen I first thought about doing this\npiece on the election, I was going to\ncompare some of the policies of the three\nparties, but since then there has been,\nto my mind, too much in the media in\ngeneral about the election, and\nsurrounding issues. Someone suggested\na poll of students, to see which way they\nare going to vote on the eleventh, but\nI figured that the replies would either be\n'what election?', or T haven't got time\non the eleventh, I 've got a lab report due\non the twelfth'. Maybe I should have\ninterviewed Dave Colley about electoral\nreform.\nSo there you have it. I wouldn't advise\nbuying any of the manifestos, but it\nmight not be a bad idea to watch a little\ntelevision and actually vote next\nThursday. I'm sorry if you expected\nFELIX to bring you an informed debate\non the issues\u2014this is all you're getting.\nThis article was compiled under Dave\nJones' reporting restrictions.\nFELIX, Friday June 5th1987 BLIND\nCURVE\nWhile looking at the wars fought\nbetween 1820 and 1945, a British meteorologist found a curious relationship. Chris\n3\u00a39NP Edwards looks at his discovery,\n\u00ab3pt the Richardson Curve.\nWhile politicians argue over whether the\npossession of nuclear weapons has\nprevented a major war, few bother to\npay even cursory attention to the patterns\nthat war has conformed to in the past.\nPatterns that may help avert an all-out\nnuclear war. In the wake of the\ndestruction that was World War II, a British meteorologist, Lewis F Richardson took an interest in the fickle\ncauses of war. His approach to the\nproblem was very similar to an approach\nin studying the weather. International\nconflicts can be regarded in much the\nsame way a storm begins, both have\nsystems that are almost impenetrable in\ntheir complexity\u2014but their bulk\nproperties can be studied and tabulated.\nThe patterns can be found that lead to\nwar, and their frequency can easily be\nplotted, so that a reasonable waiting time\ncan be found for a war of any severity-even World War III.\nIn the 19th Century the Reverend\nThomas Malthus had theorised on the\ncauses of war being due to nations trying\nto expand their populace. Whilst it left\na gaping hole for those wars fought\npurely on a religious pretext, or sparked\noff by traditional hatreds, it could\nexplain a whole range of conflicts.\nHowever, Richardson's work was of a more fundamental nature; he produced\na graph which accurately reflected the\nperiod of waiting between wars of a particular severity..\nHe collected data for the hundreds of\nwars that had been fought between 1820\nand 1945, the results of which were\npublished posthumously in the book\n\"The Statistics of Deadly Quarrels\", in\n1960. He defined an index for the\nnumber of deaths it caused directly, M. Magnitude M=3 might be only a skirmish killing a thousand, while M=6 would be far more serious, with a million dead. He found, quite\nexpected ly, that the more serious a war\nthe less frequently it would occur. He\nalso found that the data fits a smooth\ncurve that can be continued from M=0(a single murder)right up to M=10 and\nbeyond (the total annihilation of the\nhuman race). The frequency for murder\nhe extrapolated from the main graph to\narrive at a figure of a murder occur ing once every five minutes somewhere in\nthe world\u2014an answer of approximately\nthe right order of magnitude. The odd\nthing is that both murder and holocaust\nrepresent just two extremes of a1000yr100 yr lO yr j SI:'v51 mo4 continuous curve.\nJust as one person can commit murder\neither in a rage, or to effect a larger plan,\nthen nations can cause others to do the\nsame on a far larger scale. The efficient\nfighting of wars has often depended on\na good propaganda system to encourage\npeople not only to fight the enemy, but\nto loath it as well\u2014with images of \"cruel\nheathens\" in the Crusades through to the\n\"red menace\" of Vietnam, and the \"evil\nArgies\" in the Falklands.\nThere is a certain inevitability about\nRichardson's figures; they do not just\nrepresent the time to wait before a war\nof a given magnitude might occur, but\nthe time before it does, or is supplanted\nby a succession of smaller conflicts.\nWhile politicians claim that nuclear arms\nand the attendant theory of Mutually\n2 3 4 5 6 7\nWar Magnitude, M The Richardson Graph\nAssured Destruction, have ensured\nworld peace, the truth is that the\nsuperpowers have become more\ncircumspect in how wars are fought.\nWith the exception of Korea, Vietnam\nand Afghanistan, the Superpowers have\ndeclined to involve themselves, but act\nby proxy, supplying the weapons and the\nknow-how to smaller nations only too\neager to expand their spheres of\ninfluence.\nContinuing the graph past World War\nII, an approximate figure can be found\nfor a nuclear holocaust\u2014for the simplest\nmodel this gives a value of M=9.8(5 billion people). The expected gap\nbetween 1820 and a conflict of that\nmagnitude would be about 800 years,\ngiving total devastation of humanity in\nthe 27th Century. However the\nRichardson curve only applies to\nmortal i ties resulting directly from a war.\nThe further deaths from radiation and\ncancers after Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nwere not taken into account in the\nRichardson Diagram. So, it would be the\nfatalities by blast damage alone that\nwould govern the M value on the\ndiagram, and correspondingly that value\nwould be much lower, bringing\nDoomsday that much closer.\nHowever this assumes the worst case\nscenario of an all-out nuclear conflict.\nMore likely is the theory put forward by\nGeneral Sir John Hackett and others who\npostulate that World War III will again\nbe fought in Europe in a 'limited'\nexchange, whereby much of Western\nEurope is laid waste. Using a simple\nmodel for population of Europe that\ngives 500 million people killed, it gives\nM=8.7. Crossreading on the graph\nproduces a figure of 200 years after\n1820. So the destruction of Europe could\nhave happened by 2020\u2014a period\ncommonly ascribed by strategists is\nbetween 2000 and 2020.\nThe most worrying thing about the\ngraph is that it seems to indicate that\nwarfare is for the while, a part of the\nhuman condition and that the only way\nto avoid large conflicts is to let tension\ndissipate through a series of smaller\nbattles. In the wake of World War II,\nGeneral MacArthur was in favour of\ninvading Russia while it was still\nrecovering from the effects\u2014hoping to\ndefuse a future conflict. However, the\nanalyses of human nature suggest that\nthe West would now be skirmishing with\nChina instead. No matter how decisive\na war, a new enemy is always around\nthe corner to satisfy the Richardson\nrelation.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday June5 th19875 CAREERS Teaching seems to be the thing that\nmost students want to avoid at the\nmoment\u2014the status is poor, the pay\nis lousy and the work is gruelling\u2014\nthese are the reasons usually cited\nfor giving teaching a wide berth.\nWhilst it is not my job to 'sell' any\nparticular career to anybody\u2014I do\nhave a duty to help people to assess\npossible career paths as objectively as possible. So read on if you are\ninterested.\nWhat's it all about?\nThe job of a teacher doesn't need any\ndescription. You've all been through\nabout 13 years of primary and secondary\neducation. Your memories of what it\nwas like are probably the single most\ninfluential factor determining whether\nyou become a teacher. But try, just for\na minute, to put yourself in the shoes of\nthe teacher whose subject you would\nmost like to teach. How does it feel?\nTerrifying? Threatening? Challenging?\nUNION ROOM\nBOOKINGS\nBookings for next term can only be made after 22nd June, 1987.\nThese will initially be provisional until UGM dates are confirmed.\nThank you,\nKathy Tait, Union Receptionist\nGYM BOOKINGS\nTo all clubs & societies who use the gym facilities (ie\nUnion, Southside & volleyball court), if you are not using\nthe space over the summer vacation. Please let me know\nASAP. Also, although you managed to get a space this\nyear, you still need to apply for space next year.\nApplications can only be made after 5th October, 1987.\nTHANKS,\nKATHY TAIT, UNION RECEPTIONIST\nYour reaction may help you to think\nabout teaching from a different angle.\nHow would I be trained?\nAnyone wanting to teach in a State\nschool has to take a Postgraduate\nCertificate of Education (PGCE). This\nlasts for one year and may be taken at\na wide range of colleges throughout the\nUK. A central clearing house operates\ncalled the Graduate Teacher Training\nRegistry (GTTR) through which most\napplications must be channelled. The\nimportant point to remember is that\napplications can be submitted as early\nas September and places are filled on a first-come first-served basis. It is\ntherefore important to apply early if you\nwant to get your first choice. Courses\ninclude both theory and practice. You\nwill have opportunities to teach under\nobservation. LEA grants for courses are\nautomatic once a place has been offered.\nEngineers, physicists and\nmathematicians should note that\nBursaries exist which boost their\nmandatory grant by \u00a31,000\u2014\u00a31,200.\nDetails are available in the College\nCareers Office.\nWould I be suited to it?\nAn interest in and rapport with young\npeople is a good starting point, as is the\nability to put a subject across in a clear\nand interesting way. It helps to be able\nto speak confidently and remain calm\nunder pressure. Teaching can be tiring\nand a high level of physical and mental\nstamina is an asset. Patience is required\nwhen dealing with slow learners. Most\nHeads require their staff to participate\nin some extracurricular activities such\nas helping out with school plays, chess\nclub, sporting activities etc.\nWhat about career prospects?\nThis will depend upon demand for your\nsubject. Currently, physics teachers can\nexpect to progress faster than most other\nteachers becuase of staff shortages. New\nteachers are likely to start on Scale 1,\nthe position on the scale depending upon\nyour age, degree class, work experience\netc. Promotion to Scale 2 usually\nrequires taking on an additional\nresponsibility such as becoming Head of\nFirst Year or running the school library.\nScale 3 posts usually involve running\ndepartments. Further promotion leads to\ndeputy head ships and head ships. These\njobs are often entirely administrative.\nCan I survive on the pay?\nStarting salaries vary depending upon\nthe point on Scale 1 on which you start.\nThe range is currently \u00a36,533. Scale 2\nis \u00a37,302\u2014\u00a310,986. Scale 3 is\n\u00a38,910\u2014\u00a312,627. Scale 4 is\n\u00a310,533\u2014\u00a314,151. Senior teachers earn\n\u00a311,349\u2014\u00a315,330. Heads of large\ncomprehensives can earn above\n\u00a320,000.\nWhat next?\nIf you want to follow up the idea of\nteaching, why not come and have a chat\nwith one of the College Careers\nAdvisers in Sherfield Building. Your\nDepartmental Careers Adviser would\nalso be happy to talk to you.\nAlternatively, you could read the\nInformation Booklet\u2014'Teaching in\nSchools and Colleges in the UK\", copies\nof which are available in the Careers\nLibrary, Room 311, Sherfield.\nWhatever you decide, I hope this\narticle has been of some help to you.\nRuss Clark,\nCollege Careers Officer\n\n"

Well.\nSDP propaganda may not be top of my\nlist of Things I Would Like to Receive\nin the Post, but it's quite comforting to\nknow that my name's on the electoral\nroll, at least.\nMind you. it's difficult to take an\nelection seriously when the pro pog and a from all major parties seems to rely\nheavily on bad-mouthing the opposition;\nhardly a positive approach. Perhaps it's because there is really less difference\nbetween them than they'd like us to\nthink?\nDuring one of our long, which-way-to-vote discussions in the office, I came\nto a sad conclusion. Given that the party\nI'd really like to vote for doesn't exist\n(and that the nearest thing to it stands\nzero chance under the current voting\nsystem); recognising that my preferred\nmajor party stands no chance in this\nparticular constituency\u2014I may well end\nup voting for a third choice. What a wonderful system it is!\nThis, however, is an aside. The point\nof this spiel is quite simple. Everyone\nwho lives in College accommodation is\nregistered, and most of the rest of you\nshould be, too. Whatever the faults of\nthe electoral system you owe it to\nyourself to find out the facts and get out\nthere and vote next Thursday.\nKensington, for example, is a marginal\nconstituency; your vote will really count.\nSo get out there and use your vote; use\nit wisely.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nUnion Clash with Chaps\nIC Union Officers have clashed with one of the CCU tie clubs\nonce again. Following the annual dinner of the Chaps Club,\nthe Royal School of Mines drinking club, on Wednesday Night,\nthere were several reports of disruptive behavior in the Union\nbuilding. Union Deputy President Jackie Peirce, who was duty\nofficer for the evening, was subjected to verbal abuse from a group of Chaps Club members.\nThe incident comes at the end of a difficult year for relations between\nICU and the College tie clubs. In\nNovember a motion to ban the clubs\nfrom Union premises was brought to\na UGM, backed by the ICU President\nand Deputy President. At one of the\nfew well-attended Union General\nMeetings of the year, the motion was\ndefeated by 23 votes after some\nheated discussion.\nOn Wednesday, Ms Peirce was\npresent to see that club members left\nthe Union Concert Hall, which Chaps\nhad booked until lam, in good order.\nMs Peirce described the behaviour, of\nsome members as \"quite abusive\"\nand added that they \"told me exactly\nwhat they thought of me and\nChristine\".\nSpeaking to FELIX yesterday,\nChaps president and former RSMU\nPresident Dave Pearce admitted that\nsome members of Chaps had been\nabusive on a personal level, but\ndenied that there had been any\nobstructive behaviour, or opposition\nto Ms Peirce when she asked for the\nbuilding to be cleared. He added that,\nas President of the club, he had\nprobably not taken charge of the\nsituation as early as he should have\ndone. He said that Chaps had taken\nlonger to vacate the Concert Hall than\nhad been planned because they were\nnot aware that they would be expected\nto clear up. The incident, he said, had\nbeen a personal disagreement between\nthe Deputy President and a few ex-student members of Chaps, and that\nthere had been no argument between\nthe Union and Chaps Club as a whole.\nThough there have been reports that\na group of Chaps had gained access\nto the roof of the Union Building and\nhad thrown a large missile into the\nQuad, these rumours were denied by\nMr Pearce and Chaps Club Secretary\nChris Griffin.\nICU Executive will be discussing\n>possible disciplinary action against the\nclub. In addition, Chaps Club will be\nre-examining the responsibilities of\nthe Club President.\nMr Pearce and Mr Griffen said that\nthe dinner had been a great sucess,\nand that the Union Snack Bar\nmanager Mr Norman Jardine had\ndone an excellent job.\nFELIX on the Box\nIt was all smiles and screen tests in\nthe FELIX office yesterday when a production team from Channel 4\nturned up to capture the Thursday\nafternoon panic on film. After word\nof the imminent arrival of Stephen\nSpielberg got about, the office was\nsuddenly filled with keen staff\nmembers, anxious to get FELIX to\npress before the cameras left at\n1.30pm. After a series of half-hearted\nrehearsals, the Channel four people\nmanaged to film the really big scene\nwhere all the pages had to be ready\n\"in ten minutes\". Notable absentee\nwas former FELIX editor and SDP\nagent Clive Dewey, who turned up a day too early and sat in the office for\nfourteen hours on Wednesday,\nwaiting for the crew to turn up and\ngetting in everybody's way.\nChannel four were at Imperial\nCollege to film a half hour\nprogramme on the University of\nLondon.\nClive Dewey is 57.\nFree Friday, June5 th1987 No.774 "

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday June5 th19879 Reviews: Film The Big Easy\nIt is unusual for the FELIX office to\nbe sent four tickets for a press\nscreening; the immediate conclusion\nI came to was that the film must be\ndreadful. With this in mind I was\nquite pleasantly surprised; the film is\na straightforward tale of police\ncorruption in New Orleans, and\nmakes fairly easy watching for a Saturday night. The plot is a little\nthin, and quite a lot of the acting is\ncoarse, but on the whole it's a lively\nfilm with some nice humerous\ntouches.\nDennis Quaid (of The Right Stuff\nand Enemy Mine) plays the police\nlieutenant who followed his father\ninto the force and has, like all his\nfriends, been accepting 'protection'\nmoney ever since. He is happy to treat\nlightly a series of murders, seemingly\npart of a gang war between rival\ndrugs dealers, but the Assistant DA,\nplayed by Ellen Barkin (of Tender\nMercies and Desert Bloom) is\ndetermined to look more closely and\ninvestigate police involvement.\nThe film is depressingly\npredictable, in that from the first\nappearance of Ms Barken, everyone\nknows that she and Mr Quaid are\ngoing to end up in bed together. In\nfact, it's one of those films where\nmost of the audience might\nconcentrate hardest on lusting after\none another of the two stars (well, I did anyway). One can't help\nwondering how many detectives in\nNew Orleans spend as much time as\nMr Quaid in the weights room, and\nI'm sure no Assistant DA has ever\nlooked anything like Ms Barkin.\nThe film is hardly the 'sassiest,\nsexiest, coolest thriller in years' that\nthe publicity blurb made it out to be.\nbut it's a good enough film for an\nintellectually relaxing night out.\nThe Big Easy goes on general\nrelease in September.\nDavid Jones\nHello\nOut There\nI'd like to bring to everyone's notice\nthe existence of Environmental\nSociety. As some of you may know,\nEnvironmental Society was formed in\nthe Centre for Environmental\nTechnology by the postgraduate\nstudents there. During the summer\nterm, though, most people at Env\nTech do field courses then leave, and\nso at this time every year Env Soc\nfolds up.\nIt is our aim to keep this society\nrunning through the summer term in\norder to have a full program of events\nfor next year and a stall at Freshers'\nFair. We also intend to run another\nEnvironmental Week following up\nthis year's highly successful event.\nSo if you think you care about the\nissues that affect the environment\ntoday and want to learn more about\nour intentions, please get in touch\nsoon.\nCan I also mention that if anyone is\ninterested in helping to run Third\nWorld First could they please get in\ntouch with Penny Bourkes.
