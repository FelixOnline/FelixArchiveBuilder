    "content": "Feature\nCriminal Justice You saw the riots, read the tabloids and last week the CriminalJustice Bill\nbecame law. We explore what came to pass... and catch the Post Bill Blues\nThree years at Imperial have made me realise\nthat I'm not from a 'typical' student\nbackground (ie: avid socialism). Not having a long history of protests and marches under\nmy belt, I haven'ta clue as to what I'm heading into as I cross St James's Park on my\nway to the protest against the Criminal Justice\nBill (CJB). The assembly is to be staged\noutside the Houses of Parliament while inside\nthe final Commons debate to determine the\nBill's future is in session.\nThe protesters come into view as I round the corner into Parliament Square.\nThey stand in a huddled pack, safely\ncontained behind police lines, just outside the\nentrance to the Houses of Parliament. Armed\nwith my camera, I plunge into the forest of\nbodies and posters, bird calls replaced by the\nshrill cry of those ear-piercing 'rave' whistles.\nEvery now and then two drummers begin a tribal beat to which the crowd instinctively\nchants \" KILL, KILL. KILL THE BILL\".\nAn amazing cross-section of people stand\nshouting their op ip> he passers by\n(perchance politicians?).

Several people\nresent being ushered along to\nthe gathering. One guy shouts:\n\"They're making us go to church and listen to\nlectures, we don't want to do that!\" and,\nappreciating his sentiments, I abstain from\nthe exodus. But eventually we go and re-group\noutside the hall on the pavement. Across the\nroad two men begin juggling flaming torches.\nI dash to watch.

But last Thursday, on hearing that the Sill would be\ngetting its royal-assent that day, I joined a protest against the Ml 1 link road a \"protest which\nwould be cri frs i;|j$ ll aed by the afternoon. \u2122\nWearing the yellow and black \"CRIMINAL?\" placard I was given around my neck an fNb solicitor's number scrawled onto my forearm I joined the people heading down to the building\nsites.\nAt the main site people had started using metal rods and girders as cymbals and drums.\nThe rhythms, ragged with an insidious joy, made me feel like dancing in the middle of a work\nsite. Spontaneous events like these are now impossible without breaking the law. Most of the\nlocals we met were against the road, the exception being one woman who told us to go back to\nwhere-ever it was we came from. A little while later we bumped into someone who lived in the\nflat below, and he asked for one of the \"CRIMINAL?\" signs to put in his window - portly to sho\nhe was against the road and partly to piss off the woman upstairs!\nWe discovered that most of the security were happy enough to let us stop work, as long as\nnone of their supervisors were around and the machinery didn't get broken. It got a bit silly at\none point when there were just two of us perched on a JCB which was being \"protected\" by\nthree security guards The police kept quite a low profile throughout, most just blocking\nentrances, although at one point they did herd people playing music and dancing away from the\narea. The only other incident I heard of involved the police charging in and breaking Tofu Love\nFrog's instruments. (It has only just occurred to me that both the times that I know of police\ninvolvement that day involved music). As darkness fell the remaining protesters were dragged\naway by the security guards and dumped outside the site. I had seen no-one being arrested that\nday. I went there prepared to be and I still dm.\nBeing a middle class science student in the third best university in the country it would be\npossible for me to ignore this law, but I would have to also ignore what is happening to this\ncountry. Steve Hunt pious prose a fire-work sails through the air\nabove him causing the fire-alarms to go off. A general commotion ensues, and the meeting\ncomes to a premature end.\nOutside, the road back to Parliament\nsquare has been blocked. A diversion directs\nthe marchers down Great Smith Street.\nSomewhat confused, the march back to\nParliament begins. The drum beat leads us\nlike mesmerized children \"Kill, Kill, Kill the\nBill...\".\nRiot Police line the exits to side streets\nmaking ii clear where the march 'wants' to go.\nIn fi unt of y ne line a women walks back and\nfct th. jj lay rag;a flute - the pic d peace-piper?\nWhatever her intention, opinions soon\n,H')! \u2022\u2022(.Ti'*'',.,)!s oui lies across\n\u2022 e crowd hitting her square on the forehead.\nI am horrified.

Only a bewildered, though resolute, few remain.\nThey are allowed to walk to the entrance to\nthe Houses of Parliament. But with only a couple of protesters remaining, the lobby\nseems to have been less than a rallying\nsuccess.\nDuring the evening Parliament passed\nthe clause removing the right to silence. Had\nthey been oblivious to the protest? Did we not\nshout loud enough?

    "content": "News\nManager Leaves\n-1PT Eloquent Science\nSam Michel, Imperial College Union's( ICU) Events Manager, will be\nleaving his post in three weeks time, writes Andy Sinharay. Sam, who has\nbeen working at the Union for one and a half years, is due to take up a new\npost at the offices of Time Out on Tottenham Court Road, where he will be\nsetting up a \"web server'for their computer network.\nAlthough his primary responsibility was Union Events, he has been\ninvolved in the setting up of a similar system for ICU. \"I do a lot of\nInformation [Technology] stuff,\" he said. Sam has been involved in all\nmanner of activities ranging from running the Careers Fair to organising\nstewarding, balls and room hire. Being a graduate of computer systems\nengineering, he wanted to go into multimedia and felt that the Time Out job\noffered him the best opportunity.\nLeaving ICU may not be easy: \"It's been really cool here, it's a really\ngood team...I'm very sad to leave this place, and particularly the people.\"\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nThe Imperial College press office\nhas just produced a leaflet\nentitled 'Speaking to the Media'.\nWith academics increasingly\nappearing in the public eye, Ms\nLynda Davies, Director of\nMarketing, said that many\npeople were nervous about\ntalking to the media.\nThe document is designed\nto give advice on how best to talk\nto journalists and TV interviewers. \"We've had\nrequests over the last year from\npeople, mainly medics, on\nwhether there were any guide-lines, but this was something we\nwere going to do anyway,\" she\nsaid. Copies have been\ndistributed around College and\nalready the Press Office has\nreceived requests for more. \"The\ndays are gone of the PR officer\ntalking [to the press]\", she said,\n\"now it's everyone's responsibility to talk to the media.\"\nSaying that the booklet was\nlong overdue, Ms Michelle Duffy\nof the College press office said\nthat in the past staff have asked\nwhat to wear to interviews and\nhow to act. The leaflet supplements existing training courses\nat Imperial in which academics\nare subjected to mock TV interviews. Descended from\npublications produced by Frank\nAlbrighton, Director Of Public\nAffairs at Birmingham University, the booklet also contains\ninformation on handling\nsensitive issues and talking about\nresearch.\nMs Duffy, however will not\nbe at Imperial to see the fruit of\nher efforts. She is leaving her\npost as Press Officer and will be\nreturning to her native New\nZealand on Saturday. Although\nshe has worked at Imperial for\nthe last three years, she said, \"I wasn't intending to stay...but the\nlonger you stay here the harder it\nis to leave. I'm like all New\nZealanders.\" Living in Roehampton she was happy to accept\nthe offer of a post at Imperial as\nassistant press officer. \"I'd heard\nit was the best [college] in\nLondon\", she said. FELIX wishes Michelle all the best\nDown Under and awaits an\neloquent and nerve-free postcard\nfrom her homeland.\nStudent Loans For Sale\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nNEWS EDITOR\nA student fur ore has erupted\nafter a confidential Department\nfor Education document was\nleaked to The Guardian this\nweek.\nThe document details plans\nfor the privatisation of the\nStudent Loans Company. The\nstate-owned company manages\nloans to students for the which\nonly interest charged is in line\nwith inflation. Two options are\nsuggested. The first proposes\nthat the Treasury sub sid is es private banks and credit\ncompanies to the order of\nhundreds of millions of pounds\nto continue the no-interest\nsystem. Under the second\nproposal, loans would be paid\nback at commercial rates, though\nthere would be interest free\nperiods whilst studying and the\nrepayment of loans would be\ndeferred.\nThe Committee of ViceChancellors and Principles\n(CVCP) has consistently opposed\nthe Student Loans Company.\nSpeaking to FELIX, spokesman\nDr Ted Nield said, \"We\ndisapprove of the Student Loans\nCompany fundamentally. That's mainly because of the repayment\nscheme. We don't see any\ndifference between a Student\nLoan Company which is publicly\nowned or one that is privately\nowned. If the Government had\ngot the repayment scheme right\nin the first place, the banks\nwould have taken it.\"\nThe CVCP favour a mechanism whereby students do\nnot have to repay the loan in a fixed period. \"You repay a fixed\npercentage of your income once\ngraduated. The term of the loan\nvaries until the loan is repaid.\"\nLucy Chothia, President of\nImperial College Union,\ncondemned the plans: \"It's completely appalling. We have\nhuge numbers of students who\nare up to their neck in debt. The\nGovernment just seems to be set\non ruining students and forcing\npeople from less well off families\nout of higher education.\"\nAt a college welfare meeting\nheld earlier this week, College\nappeared to have resigned itself\nto Government policy. An attend ee commented, \"It's extremely frustrating to see the\napathy amongst college welfare\nstaff when this means so much to\nthe students.\"\nHorse\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nResearch being undertaken at\nImperial will determine the\nfuture of equestrian events at the\nnext Olympics.\nIn a joint venture with the\nAnimal Health Trust, Dr Robert\nSchroter of the Bagrit Centre,\nhas been studying the effects of\nthe punishing Atlanta environment on the horses' welfare.\nBased on the research, the FEI,\nthe international body which\ngoverns equestrian events, has\nsubmitted a report to the\nInternational Olympic Committee with guidelines for 1996's3 day event.\nConcern mounted after the\nlast Olympics in Barcelona,\n(Continued on page 3, col 1)\nliT iHM FELIX n nou94 "

    "content": "THE menu Standby\n(D heartstrings and bangs\nOkay, let's get one thing straight.\nThe Alarm were a great band (a statement which should exterminate\nany street c redI possess). And after\nseeing ex-frontman Mike Peters at\nthe LA2, you can be sure that he's now at the helm of another great\nband.\nSo what's great? Try honesty,\ncommitment, passion and, of\ncourse, those songs - Dylan, the\nStones and the Clash welded into\nheartfelt anthems. Ably backed by\nhis band, the Poets, Mike treated\nhis army of dedicated followers to\nan unceasing torrent of gems from\nhis debut solo album, Breathe, as\nwell as an ample selection of past\nclassics. Perhaps it was telling that\nit took 'Where were you hiding\nwhen the storm broke', from 1984's 'Declaration', to really ignite the\ncrowd but from then on everything\nwas ecstatically lapped up. Gentle,\nhaunting songs like 'Levis & Bibles',\npunchy, angry sounds of intent like\n'Back into the System' and even an\nacoustic medley combined to fill\nour hearts with joy. I could spout\nsuperlatives for a whole page but\nthen I don't have that much space.\nSo, let's just say that if live\nplaying is still seen as a true test of\nwhether a rock band can really cut\nit, and if honesty is still held as a virtue, then Mike Peters deserves\nyour attention - now.\nQueensryche have often been\ndescribed as the thinking person's heavy metal band. If you're not\nconvinced or just don't know, then\none spin of their fifth album,\nPromised Land, should do the trick.\nNot that you'll like it after one spin.\nNo, because thinking person's music means complex arrangements,\nstrange time signatures, seemingly\nodd instrument mixes and most of\nall, the need for patience. Thank\ngoodness that patience decided to\npay me a surprise visit for this\nalbum because it's worth taking the\ntime over.\nThere aren't many bands who\ncan plunge you headlong from the\nsound of a baby being born\n('9.28am') into an Easternflavoured, Zeppelin-style rock piece\n('I am I') and leave you wanting\nmore. There aren't many bands\nwho with one hand can paint\nparanoid soundscapes around a menacing, rolling guitar riff\n('Damaged') and then with the\nother hand guide you gently\nthrough the pain of not having a proper father-to-son relationship in\nan emotive, acoustic setting\n('Bridge'). And there certainly aren't many bands who can mix heavy\nguitar, background spoken word\nFELIX\nsections and rhythmic, saxophones\ninto an eight minute title track and\nprevent it from turning out a disaster l So, if you're a thinking\nperson and you don't like heavy\nmetal...you work it out. (7)\nAfter several false starts,\nTerrorvision finally sauntered onto\nstage and launched into an altered\nversion of 'Alice what's the\nmatter?', the current single.

Terrorvision's songs are\nwell written, memorable and with\ntheir obvious talent it's easy to see\nwhy they have earned so much\npraise from a usually apathetic\nmusic press.\nTheir usual laid back approach\nand ability not to take themselves\ntoo seriously was marred by the\nappearance in 'Middleman' of a ten piece string section in evening\ndress, complete with conductor.\nThis was a little o.t.t. and pompous,\nand it would be shame if\nTerrorvision followed so many\nbands into self-indulgence. Apart\nfrom that however, it was a seriously good gig from Bradford's finest. Roll on the next album.\nThe new Front 242 album,\nLive, is less techno and more back\nto the original industrial roots of\nthe band. The authentic power tool\nsounds that are synonymous with\nlive industrial music are all here,\nthough whether these are being\nplayed live or come off a tape is\ndebatable. (Few venues will allow\nsuch performances these days after\nhearing horror stories about the\nstages collapsing after being cut to\npieces by over enthusiastic power\nsaw wielding industrial bands.)\nThis cd is a very good\nproposition for existing 242 fans.\nWith dates cancelled in the last UK\ntour this could be the only chance\nthat some of them will get to hear\nthe band live. If you're not familiar\nwith Front 242, or industrial music,\nthen I wouldn't recommend this\nrelease; go out and buy one of the\nmainstream albums and lose\nyourself in the gorgeous multi-layered noise that Front 242 have\nperfected over the last decade, then\nthink about buying this.

Don't believe the flyer's description of Funk-the-music.\nHere is Trip hop and I hated it.\n(Trip hop is a fusion of just about\neverything; house, funk and hip\nhop, and nobody dances.)\nHowever having live jam\nsessions in between the DJ's sets\nwas an inspired decision by the\npromoter and her inspiration\ndidn't leave her when she chose\nIke Leo to head up the music that\nevening. Sadly the Bar Rumba\ncrowd has changed and even Ike's excellent double base plucking\ndidn't have people moving. But all\nthis is just opinion. The place is\nrammed wall to wall every\nMonday, so it can't be just the DJs\nthat like standing still to music.\nThere is nothing better than\nlive, improvised funk for moving\nthe soul as well as the feet. So for\nall those who need therapy, here's Ike's guide to live clubbing:\nIceni (White Horse St) on\nWednesday and Saturday.\nWKD (18 Kentish Town Rd)\non Friday and Sunday.

    "content": "lira Curricular\nwho: Overseas\nWhat: Foreign Affairs Part 2\nKeys: Benelux, Disco Night\nFirst of all, I would like to thank FELIX for\nthe coverage of the first Chairman &\nTreasurers' Meeting of the Overseas\nStudents' Committee (OSC) in issue 1009.\nSome important points were raised in the\narticle and here I shall clarify the present\nstate of the OSC, and also give a short report\non what we've been doing and what we are\nplanning for the future.\nThis year the OSC started off with just\none elected member of the executive commit-tee, the Chairman. This was due to the elections being held during the exam period of\nthe summer term. Fortunately, by the first\nweek of this term people interested in the\nOSC (who later became members of the com-mitte e) volunteered to help out. This made it\npossible for the OSC to hold a stall during the\nFresher's Fair and deal with all urgent mat-ter s. The new elections took place on the 19th October and although there was a low\nturnout, most of the committee posts were\nfilled. By having the elections so late in the\nfirst term we enabled fresher s to stand for\nposts, something which was impossible in\nprevious years. We now have a full committee\nof 12 elected members, holding all available\nposts.\nThe 'Overseas Disco Night' was organised jointly with Ents and happened on\nFriday the 4th of November. This was actually an improvement over previous years as the\nUnion was used instead of the JCR, so there\nwas a band and a long bar extension.\nOverseas students that were members of a society (i.e. had paid their membership fee)\nwent in for free as the event was fully sub-sidi sed by the OSC, whilst non-members had\nto pay \u00a32. More than a hundred overseas students took advantage of this and it seemed\nthat everybody had a great time, as both the\nband and the disco were quite different from\nwhat we are used to getting in the Union. It\nwas a great opportunity for international students (and fresher s in particular) to meet and\ncommunicate with British students while\nhaving a good time. Finally, overseas societies were able to recruit more members as\nthe advantages of paying a small membership\nfee were immediate.\nWell, that's all gone so what's next?\nComing up next is the start up of at least two\nnew overseas societies - the Benelux Society\nand the Italian Society - which will receive a grant from the OSC as soon as all the little\ndetails are dealt with. This will increase the\nnumber of overseas societies in IC to 23.\nThe OSC is also investigating the possibility of creating a National Committee for\nOverseas Students. Contacts with UL U and\nNUS (National Union of Students) have been\nmade and results of preliminary talks are\nmore than satisfactory. If this actually works,\nit will be a major step in integrating students\nfrom around the world, and particularly\nEuropean Students and things like 'real certificate equivalence' will become possible,\nand IC will receive credit for this as it will\nactually have originated the OSC.\nThe next big event is the Overseas Week\nwhere all the overseas societies (hopefully\nincluding the two new ones) will have the\nopportunity to promote and educate others in\ntheir cultures by holding stalls in the JCR.\nIf you want to find out more about any of the\nabove contact the OSC through our pigeonholes\n(OSC Exec.) in the Union Office.\nIr tic les fo jX Ira Cur r 'km iar\nIf'you would li'kf mv< to be\nincluded'in t fcu Xtra Zuti cu'la'i section\npt< as c>nn g it aio ig I \u2022 i lieF tLi Office\nf hen tide n usi \u2022\u2022: sub u iii rei on ii .\n; . ida-ib me at it d< \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022 mi >\ni and pre-v in iji,> riis is Article -lib. pictures \u00a7\u00a711 tak f\\> or ty ove i lb >se tha\nu \u201e/... i limned If y cm snide i rio j fi lias S DO words fieri ,-\u2022>\u2022 mm ||\nadvance warning.\n\u00b04r BUSTA.

A very significant aspect\nof LCC life, and one I know many of you\nhave experienced personally, is\nevan g eliza tion. LCC's belief is that we\nshould live exactly in the image of Jesus'\ndisciples. Jesus expressly commanded\nthat they go and make other disciples.\nLCC are persistent because they believe\nyou can only be a disciple if you are\nbaptised into a church of disciples - and\nthey would indicate the LCC.\nThere are also daily aspects of life\nin the church. Each weekday morning you\nmeet someone else and pray together for about\nan hour. You are also expected to read the\nBible for about 1/2 hour a day and this,\ncombined with everything else, makes life in\nthe LCC very intense.\npsychological and emotional pressure to distort\nthe relationship between church and individual,\nenslaving their disciples.

On the one hand I had family, friends at IC, people I'd never met\nbefore, leaflets, the national media and my\nown concerns telling me to GET OUT. On\nthe other, I had the close friends I deeply\nvalued saying STAY IN. I often felt totally\nalone and isolated because there was no-one\nwho was neutral and understood what I was\ngoing through. I was torn apart inside\nbetween \"Stay in? Get out?\" It was\nemotional torture.\nIt is also very difficult for your family\nwho, wanting to protect you, cannot\nunderstand why you don't leave.\nFinancially it is not good either. This,\nin fact, is not really due to the 10%\n'contribution', but to the day-to-day costs.\nTube fares, and eating out because you don't have time to cook, are just a couple of ways the\nmoney trickles away.\nLet's just put things into perspective\nand remember that behind this intense\nlifestyle is a minor detail: your degree. The\ndemands on your time undeniably conflict\nwith study at IC. This is exacerbated by the\nemotional stress you are under.\nThis was the situation I was in.\nEmotionally stressed, falling behind with\ncoursework, financially drained and\nhaunted by the question I couldn't answer: \"should I stay or should I go?\".\nThe final straw was my end of year mark,\nwhich was, to say the least, on the razor\nedge between pass and fail.\nOK, so what if you decide to leave?\nFirstly the idea scares you because you\nhave become dependent on the\nfriendships. Secondly the LCC will make\nit very difficult. They have a juicy\nselection of quotes to instill guilt and a fear of\nhell-fire and damnation. Any point you raise\nthey can flatten.\nThe only thing to do is cut yourself off.\nWhen you do, you and your family receive\npersistent phone calls. People even travel\nacross the country to see you, believing Satan\nhas twisted your mind away from God. This\nalso illustrates the tragic side of involvement,\nbecause these people are quite simply the\nfriends you have made, who have come to\ndepend on and value your friendship - bonds\nthat are cruelly lacerated.\nIn summary, life in the London Church\nof Christ is in many ways happy, stimulating\nand refreshing, but, in many more, sad,\nconfusing and disruptive.\nMy advice if you're approached?

(The\nlatter is the Chairman of the\nHouse of Lords' Select\nCommittee on Science and\nTechnology enquiry into\n\"Regulation of the UK Biotechnology Industry and\nGlobal Competitiveness\".) They\ngave their views on the lay panel's report. The politicians' attitude\nwas depressingly predictable:\nthey stressed communicating to\nand educating the public, rather\nthan consultation and dialogue.\nLord Howie gave us a typical politician's speech. He kicked\noff by insulting the panel, claiming the conference process will\nhave little \"ultimate value\"\nA. Crispy lamb with wok fried rice and\nseasonal vegetables 5.00\nB.

In saying\nthis he neglected the\nmonths of work the lay\npanel put in before the\nconference started.\nNext, he professed\nbroad agreement with\nthe lay panel's report\nand then detailed his\ndissent from all their\nmain conclusions. The\nreport expressed a strong desire for more\ncontrol and in form a tion. At present, once\nthe government has\napproved \"deliberate\nrelease\" of genetically\naltered plants, a company has no obligation to\nmonitor the effects of\nthe release. The panel recommended obligatory post-release\nmonitoring. Lord Howie called\nthis \"a fourth hurdle that is not\nright.\" Fourteen of the panelists\nsaid they would eat food produced from genetically transformed plants. They also called\nfor \"clear meaningful labelling\"\nof all products that have been\ngenetically engineered, so that\n\"the public can ... freely exercise\nits right to choose.\" Lord Howie\ndisagreed with this too, saying\nthat consumers would equate\nlabelling with danger, as on cigarette packets. In so doing he\nshowed his disdain for the public.\nAre politicians more qualified to\nmake decisions about complex\nissues like plant biotechnology?\nThey probably know a lot less\nthan the lay panel now do.\nUnfortunately we cannot ignore\nLord Howie's decisions, nor will\nwe ever have the opportunity to\nvote him out of the Lords.\nThe panel strove for independence when writing their\nreport. The opening statement\nsaid \"We set the agenda of discus-sion, requested the relevant available experts as we understood\nthem to be, evaluated their evidence to the best of our ability,\nand wrote the report with complete independence.\"\nGiven 16 panelists, the balanced tone of the report was\ninevitable. It perhaps summarise s the evidence given to the panel\nwithout giving a coherent set of\n'he ice* a vest he mm -t\\W bg i are\"' ht joo 'fife a ncl/ oi\n, - ! i' of mode mi.1r>;2 What pos ssb b>m pod could plan i P/!'''!oni> consumer?3 vS' li cr.,: \u00ab, impact co uki plan \u2022\nbiotechnology: Hove otv ih \u00ab\ner tv ir ort mer rl:4: in \u2022>;e.,,'s< \u2022\u2022 u.p rk!\"/> \u201e u<J t,>|.lI5 Why. are t.<i \u2022.-,\u2022,< j.< \u2022 oi iiie Jie e tud props \u2022 . \u2022- 0...:y;........r... aH\nbiotechnology'..< rather '\u2022'<\u2022\u2022\nhar r n:S'f he de'\u00a5eloping. world now anc li':\nfBe' future?7 Who! ore I, \u2022 prospects for effective\n, till.:<!.( i recommendations. This was\nunsurprising given the extremely\nshort time the panel had to compile the report. They adjourned to\nwrite it at 3.30 on Thursday afternoon and presented the completed version at 10 the following\nmorning. In my view this devalued the rest of the conference.\nThe report contained too many\nambiguous statements and inconsistencies. Will consensus conferences\nbecome \"a new way of making\ndecisions in the UK\", as Anne\nCampbell MP hoped? In this\ncountry we have become far too\ndependent on an adversarial system of validating facts and making decisions. To move away from\nsuch systems, we must support\nworking alternatives that allow a wide range of people to feel that\nthey've been consulted, or at least,\nthat their interests have been\ntaken into account. That way we\ncan all feel we have invested part\nof ourselves in our society. The\nconference has already partly succeeded by bringing together all\nthe interested parties, and forcing\nthem to debate intelligently.\nMore success depends upon those\nin power making use of the report\nfrom this consensus conference\nand commissioning more confer-en ces.

    "content": "CluedUp\nPOLITICAL SCIENCE\nConsider the objects that an artist\nand a scientist creates.\nAn artist produces objects\nwhich are very personal to her, but\nare taken on by the universe as\nvery personal to them. An artist will\nnot sell objects which are too\npersonal to her. Kubrick may ban\nThe Clockwork Orange in Britain,\nbut the general impression is that\nan artist's responsibility for her\nwork ends as soon as the work is\ntaken on by the public.\nBut consider the scientist.\nHe produces theories for the\nuniverse. His theories have no\npersonal appeal to himself: they\nare of an immense generality, of\nuse to everyone. But contrary to\nthe spirit in which the theory is\nproduced, the universe (ie,\neverybody else) does not take on\nthe theory as though it were part of\nthem. Theories are tools,\nextensions to our thoughts, but\nsomething cold, something alien.\nWe are impressed by the simplicity\nof a theory, but perhaps not in the\nsame way as we are awed by a magnificent piece of art.\nThere is the other difference\n(in the objects produced) that a scientist is rarely in the position\nwhere he will say \"\nI won't publish\nthis theory because it means\nsomething to me\". In fact, the\nscientist usually has the opposite\napproach. Recall Einstein writing to\nRoosevelt at the time of the Second\nWorld War, saying that if America\ndid not produce the A bomb then\nthe Germans would. \"If I don't publish this theory then somebody\nelse will.\" Is it because a scientist\nproduces objects of such universal\ngenerality that he feels less\nresponsibility for its behaviour?\nSamin\nNEW WOULD ORDER Saddam's latest bout of\nadvent uris m in the Gulf again\nforces on others the question of\nhow to prevent him from keeping\nthe region churned up and\ninsecure indefinitely. Once again\nhe has created a military crisis and\nbeen forced back by American\nmight and muscle. And yes, once\nagain he could end up with a deal\nthat allows him to remain in total\ncontrol at home, grow in prestige\nabroad as a leader of Islam and\nrebuild for a new bullying session\nagainst his neighbours.\n\"Saddam is an\nunconventional\nmiscreant...\"\nOf the latest solutions in\nkeeping Saddam Hussein at bay,\nand one that seems to be\ngathering considerable support, is\nto restrict the forces he can deploy\nin southern Iraq. Another would be\nto demonstrate to the Iraqi people\nthat he cannot protect the\nsovereignty and integrity of the\nIraqi nation. This is a good idea,\nbut there seem to be signs of\nslippage amongst the allies, with\nthe French and the Russians not in\nagreement with the U.S. and\nBritain on how this should be\nimplemented. No matter, any\nrestriction on the mobility of\nSaddam's troops is likely to reduce\nhis trouble making ability.\nThe Iraqi leader complains\nthat the UN is treating him\nunfairly. No sooner does he claim\nto meet a UN demand, than\nanother is put before him. He is\nright to say that more is demanded\nof him than conventional\nmiscreants.\n\"Iraq does not\ndeserve a break...\"\nThere is a good reason: he is\nan unconventional miscreant, more\ndupl ici to us, more dangerous, more\ntenacious and some would say,\nmore insane. Saddam's Iraq does\nnot deserve a break from others;\nothers deserve protection from\nSaddam's Iraq. Can they gain\nsufficient protection while he\nremains in Baghdad is the\nquestion?\nSanctions remain in place, as\nthey should. They pressurize\nSaddam Hussein to respect UN\nresolutions. His pressure on his\npeople shows their effect. The Iraqi\npeople are suffering from the\nsanctions, but much of that is\nbecause he denies what relief they\ncould get if he took up the long\navailable option to sell oil under\ninternational supervision for\nhumanitarian supplies. The UN is\nright to hold sanctions.\nAITA\nFrater Fiam writes\nI found myself in\nthe unusual\nposition last\nweek of having\nto direct some\na quaint ances to\na location not\nmore than five\nminutes from\ntheir very own\ncollege - a place\nthat they had\ninhabited for a full two dozen\nmonths and yet more. Your Frater,\nas you may imagine, was disturbed\nby this. He questioned how they\ncan live, if they have no knowledge\nof the area they are living in. Have\nthey no desire for exploration?\nEveryone within academia\nshould be an explorer. They have\nopted to devote three years or\nmore exploring the niceties of a subject which should be close to\ntheir hearts. Yet the will to explore\nis strangely lacking in many - they\nremain like those derided souls\ntether'd in Plato's cave, destined to\nsee only a cinematic projection of\nthe tomfoolery of those who mock\nthem. Your Frater would like to ask\nhis readers if they are similarly\nmocked.\nEverybody should exert\nthemselves with exploration, both\ninternally and\nexternally. It is an\nimpossible to\nexplore all, but\ncertain fruitful\nareas remain surprisingly un sought. One such realm is\nthat of the Self,\nthat place of dark\nand unbound\ndesires, that\nmiasma of trivia\nand un forgotten pasts. The few who successfully\nundertake the task of self\nknowledge gain notoriety, such is\nthe difficulty of their task. Sages,\nseers, mystics all walk this path,\nand some go far. Some few may\neven reach the destination, that of\ntotal awareness; but in doing so\nthey inevitably are no longer\nhuman. Your Frater has only\ntouched the surface of this realm,\nand yet there is sufficient within for\nhim to mark each new discovery\nwith permanence. Two such marks\nare now borne by he.\nSo I shall instruct you this\nweek to reach deep, deep into\nyour minds so as to truly know\nwhat is there, yea to truly know\nwhat is there.I must depart anon,\nas Gabriel awaits.\nElimination by Catfish\n31 \u2022 Gag 22 -Story \u2022--:\",::,:,:\nShy 23 BSl-rr! ..\n3 Top Civic .:S: S!:::;,4.

    "content": "HHI Rag Week Pull Out\nBeer Festival\nCalling all piss heads, real ale fans, cheap-skates, students... in fact anyone who likes a good pint or two. This event is the biggest\nnon-CAMRA beer festival in the country,\nand basically involves lots of people consuming approximately 3 tonnes of some of the\nbest beer around in the comfort and safety of\nthe JCR. Also the Beer Festival marks the\nlaunch of this years version of IC's notorious\nRAG MAG!\nSlave Auction\nPiles of washing up, laundry getting on top of\nyou, lecture notes in need of copying? Here's the ideal solution, the Slave Auction is where\nanyone who is silly enough to take part auctions off twenty four hours of their time with\nthe proceeds going to charity . Buying a slave\nfor the day could help you get your life sorted\nout! Imagine having all your meals cooked\nfor you, having all those smelly socks washed,\nthat urgent lab report written up all whilst you sit around with your\nfeet up having all your drinks bought to you... unfortunately sexual\nfavours are by written consent only! But still worth your while, you\ncould club together with a group of friends to buy a really good looking slave. Concert Hall at 1.00pm if you fancy signing up as a slave\nyourself pop along to the Guilds office or Rag office and put your name\ndown.\nRag Rugby\nVirgins get to grips with the miners\nThe match of the weekend has to be the charity rugby match between\nthe Royal School of Mines Rugby Football Team and our very own\nLadies Rugby Football Team, the I.C. Virgins (who are they trying to\nkid!). The ladies team have only been going for a year and what they\nmay lack in talent and fitness they make up for in enthusiasm and pure\nskill when it comes to the odd boat race! Last year the ladies threw\ndown the gauntlet and the men were so bemused that they played in\nstocking and suspenders! The battle then commenced with the girls\nputting up a valiant fight against the men and doing extremely well,\nthe final score was 24-24!! So whoever said women can't play rugby\nshould have been there to witness this spectacular event, as you should\nbe. Come along and watch the most unique game of rugby you are likely to see, we are playing at Osterley again this year travelling out there\nby coach, if you want to come then book in the RSMU Office or see\nany member of the IC Virgins team. This promises to be one wacky\nevent so miss it at your peril, after all, what else is there to on a Sunday\nafternoon!!\nRag Services\nServices will be operating during the whole week and, for a small fee,\nyou can get almost anything done to anyone. City and Guilds College\nUnion are running the notorious Hit squad and the Royal College of\nScience are doing Grim Reaping, handcuff-o grams and pint-o grams.\nTo explain these further, for anyone who didn't know, Hit squad provides you with the opportunity to get a flan placed in the face of your\nbest friend or your worst enemy. Lecturers are not out of the question\nif you can club together the danger money, and if you think final year\nstudents are too boring then why not get a mass hit taken out on an\nentire lecture?! Hits can be taken out on production of a Union card at\nthe C& GU Office in Mech. Eng. Contact lens wearers should also get\nthemselves a contact lens immunity badge which prevents flan s from\nhitting you in the face, this can also be obtained from the same place.\nGrim Reaping involves setting a grim reaper to follow someone around\nall day until they cough up enough money to get rid of them. For a small charge you can have a pint and a packet of bar nibbles delivered\nto someone (or yourself) during a lecture, lab, tutorial... you tell us\nwhere, when and who and we'll sort it out. Handcuff-o grams involve\nhandcuffing two victims together until they cough up sufficient\namounts of money to get the keys. Do you hate someone enough to\nhandcuff them to that boring smelly person in the corner? For any one\nof these services pop along to the RCS office, round the back of\nChemistry and see one of the friendly bod s inside.\nBeer and Cider List\nBrewer Beer Brewer Beer Brewer Beer\nAdnams Broadside, Mild Morlands Old Masters Courage Directors\nArchers Village, Head Banger Morlands Old Speckled Hen Gibbs Mew Deacon\nBatemans Dark Mild, Victory Palmers Bridport, Tally Ho!

The renewed and renamed\nEuropean Society is up and running; it took\nus a lot of effort to first re-establish the society within the Union framework and then to\nwiden its scope and enhance its merits by\nbringing new ideas in and continuing to support previous activities. We are now ready to\npresent to the rest of the student body our\nlines of interest and activities for this term.\nIn last week's FELIX we had an article\npublished about the second \"Europe 2020\"\nconference, which will take place in the\nUniversity of Oxford from March 18th to\nMarch 24th1995. The structure of the conference is as\nfollows : it starts with a welcoming team-building program on Sunday; and the following two days are spent on committee work.\nThe first day theme will be \"Europe and the\nCitizen\", whereas the second day discussion\ncomes under the \"Europe beyond its bor-der s\" heading. Two major committees will\ndeal with the above subjects, each divided\ninto 9 subcommittees, each of them having\none specific aspect of each subject to debate\nupon. High calibre speakers, such as Paddy\nAshdown, Willy Claes (NATO Gen.Sec),\nSir Edward Heath, Michael Heseltine, etc.\nhave been invited to address the participants\non both the subjects. At the end each committee produces a white paper, its opinion on\nthe problem called to discuss, which will be\npresented before the General Assembly of all\nthe delegates, and voted on. The application\nmaterial must be sent to Oxford University\nby Thursday the 1st of December 1994 at the\nlatest. The essays will be judged by an academic panel based in Oxford , who will recommend a list of candidates to be invited to the\nconference. Please feel free to declare your\ninterest and don't worry about the subjects\nthemselves, we work together on this and\nwe'll make sure that each and every one produces a good essay and application.\nB.E.S.T.: Board of European Students\nof Technology : a dynamic pan-european student organisation. Imperial College is very\nprivileged to be its representative in the\nLondon area, i.e. the local BEST group.\nBEST involves nearly all the leading technical institutions (universities of Barcelona,\nEindhoven, Lund, Trondheim, Bratislava,\nBudapest, Torino, Patras, Lisboa,\nCopenhagen, etc.) in a network of exchanging experience and information on technical\nand scientific issues. Within BEST and by\nmeans of it, students enjoy the advantages of\nwidening their educational perspectives by\nlooking at other peoples' methods and problems, coming in. contact with Industry on an\ninternational level, learning to communicate\nand work effectively with other fellow\nEuropeans, travelling on limited expense and\nreally so much more. Last year we nearly lost\nall these due to the fact that the previous\nEuropean Soc remained inactive for most of\nthe year. As said previously, this year we are\nmaking a fresh restart; we need more people\nto develop our local group, to make our voice\nheard to the rest of Europe. We are thinking\nof organising a summer course next sum-mer. In the mean time those who will put\neffort into it and can afford to take some time\noff will get to be sponsored and travel to meet\nwith people from other local groups and\nshare views on e.g. how to shape future engineering education, and go on in the summer\nto do a summer course somewhere in Europe.\nWe meet in Chem. Eng. building,\nLecture Theatre 1 at 13:00 each Monday; if\nyou really like to travel, to meet fellow\nEuropeans, to find out what opportunities are\nthere for you, this is your society.

    "content": "Feature\nBeware! London Church of Christ\nOn some campuses they're banned. At King's they've\nbeaten up. Who are the LONDON CHURCH OF\ndo people join, and what does membership involve?\nEvery Sunday afternoon, 1500 people meet in\na hall somewhere in London. There is a huge\nvariety of people from many racial\nbackgrounds. Over 90% are less than 30 years\nold. For as many as 400 this is the first time\nthey've been. Among those who have been\nbefore there's an excited buzz; eager\nexpectation for the service to begin.\nAt the front there's a stage with\nmicrophones and big speakers; suddenly, to\nloud applause, 4 guys and 4 girls\nenter. They are the song leaders and,\nfollowing their instructions, the\ncongregation comes alive to fill the\nroom with song. Forget traditional\nhymns; this is jazzy, funky music\nwith rhythm and energy. For the\nnext 2 hours there'll be more songs,\nbread and wine, fellowship and\npreaching the Bible. This is the\nLondon Church of Christ, or LCC.\nIn 1982 a tiny group of people\ncame from Boston, USA, to spread\nthe Boston Church of Christ (itself a break-away from the orthodox\nChurch of Christ) into Europe. They\nformed the LCC.\nThe foundation of LCC teaching is the Bible and every\nmember has at least one copy.\nThrough regular sermons and one-to-one instruction, new members soon\nhave guidance for all aspects of life\nwith a selection of Bible quotes\nforming the core doctrine.\nAt an early stage they also\nmention one of the most\ncontroversial aspects of life in the\nLCC. Each member is expected to\ngive 10% of their gross income to the\nchurch. This, they say, goes to the\nconsiderable running costs of a church with 1100 members and 30\nfull-time staff, and also to charity\nactivities in Africa and India.\nYou agree, and when you next meet, or\neven in the first encounter, the conversation\nquickly turns to religion. Before you know it\nthey've got a Bible open before you and are\nshowing you verses that indicate you're not\nactually a Christian, even though you thought\nyou were.\nHaving worked during my gap year and\nthen been on an expedition to a remote,\nmountainous rainforest area, ending in my\neven been known to get\nCHRIST, how and why\nand tell you it would be useful to go through\nthem alone.\nWhen you meet again it's the same\nsituation: clear, precise arguments supported\nby quotations. Your resistance drops - it all\nseems so right. Two or three weeks later, and\nafter intense reading of Bible quotes together\nwith careful instruction, you're beginning to\nbelieve God wants you to live the rest of your\nlife as a disciple in the LCC. You're also led\nto believe that nasty things will happen\nif you don't. Finally you agree to go for it and\nare baptised into the LCC. This\nj \u00a7f involves total immersion in water - any\nwill do, from a heated swimming pool to\nthe chilly Serpentine! It is actually a very joyous occasion, with a lot of people\nthere, singing and praying. The sense of\nbelonging is beginning.\nDAY TODAY It's early in the first term. You're in the JCR,\nstill a bit bewildered. You're queuing for food\nand someone starts chatting to you. They're\nfriendly and you talk about study, sports,\nwhatever. After a while they invite you to a sports event or maybe a Bible discussion or\njust to go for a drink sometime.\nPhoto: Matt\nbeing offered a place as an assistant expedition\nleader on a future expedition, I didn't consider myself as having a weak character. If\nyou think you're the same, don't be fooled.\nSometimes there's two or three people\nwith them and one of them always finds a quote to quell any protestations or\ndisagreements you have. During the next few\nhours you see your beliefs of the past 20 years\ncrumble away. You're numb by the end of it\nand hardly realise you've agreed to meet them\nagain. They've written all the quotes down\nThe LCC is split into zones. From I.C. you'd be in the Central Zone, which is\nmade up entirely of students. Try to\nimagine a group of 70 students with as\nmany, if not more, girls as guys. Fashion\ndesigners, illustrators, philosophers,\nlinguists, lawyers^, economists and\nmedics, as well as other engineers,\nscientists and computing students. You\nsee them so much that you very quickly\ndevelop close relationships with many of\nthem. You often meet them during the\nweek purely for the stimulating\nfriendships.\nHFT| Tuesday evenings are taken up\nwith the 'zone meeting'. This is a time\nto social is e but mainly involves listening\nto a sermon, or 'message'.\nOn Fridays you regularly meet in\nParkes someone's flat, developing these\nfriendships. You go for drinks, watch films or\nplay sport; invariably a 'message' is included.\nSaturday evenings are a time for dating\n- within the LCC. Group dates are the most\ncommon, ranging from seeing a film to going\non day returns to Paris. This raises an\ninteresting point - you are basically destined\nto marry someone from the church!\nThe focus of the LCC week is the\nservice on Sunday afternoon. Imagine the\nbuzz that I described earlier being enhanced\nby the presence of such close friends.\nFELIX\n\n"

Edited this week by Glyph\nHacky\nRamblings\nDear Owain,\nI have been actively involved\nwith Sports Clubs over the last two\nyears and have a knowledge of\nmost of them. The advert you\ncarried for Wing Chun Kung Fu in\nFelix issue 1010 rather amused me.\nI find it hard to believe that the\nClub manages charity work within\nthe Union gym and would\nappreciate any information about\nsuch activities.\nThe advert also mentions the\nMayors of London, Westminster\nand Haringey, when did these\ndemonstrations take place?\n\"Many Celebrities and VIPs have\nwalked the grounds of IC\", yes, but\nhow many have been interested in\nWing Chun? Sifu Sofos has been\nawarded \"progress with humanity\",\nso? What the hell is \"progress with\nhumanity\"?\nWing Chun claim to have raised\nmoney for charities (do RAG know\nabout this?) exactly how much\nmoney has been raised, and which\ncharities? Is the parent academy\nfor Wing Chun the charity?\nHow does the Club manage to\ncouncil students for exam work and\nemotional stresses? Surely this is a matter for the professionals in the\nUnion and College. Wing Chun\nclaim to be the \"winning team\".\nWhat competitions have they\nentered? Are the results\nacknowledged by UAU and the\nUnion?\nSurely a Club talking about\ngiving students \"spiritual\nenlightenment\" should be a religious Society and hence in\nSCC?\nEveryone should wise up to\nadverts and read them for what\nthey actually are. Self\ncongratulating drivel without\nfoundation should be ignored l Students of Imperial College\nyou have been warned.\nName wit held by request\nWell, if your inferiority complex is\nsuch that you require new and\ninteresting ways in which to kick the\ndesiccated coconut out of people,\nthe adverts you write are not going\nto draw attention to the fact that\nyou are a psychotic. \"Join the Royal\nMarines, we have a fabulous dental\nplan\"etc. Still, why do you care?\nThis reeks of internal hack y politics\nto me. Slide back under your rock\nwhy don cha Mr Request.\nOut ofthe\nCloset and\nUnder the\nTofu\nDear Felix,\nIn response to Samin's comment\nthat \"To Glyph, gay is trendy\",\nwhether Glyph or Samin himself\nactually believe this; being gay\nisn't trendy.\nAs an out lesbian at Imperial\nCollege I find that the atmosphere\non campus is incredibly\nhomophobic. This isn't helped by\nstatements saying that people are\nonly gay because it's fashionable.\nWhen people start to realise that\nhomosexuality isn't something you\ncan change like you can change\nyour shoes, then perhaps we will\nmove a step closer to equality at\nI.C. Yours sincerely\nJane Hoyle\n(Biology III)\nYou must understand that I was\nhaving a go at the politically correct\nview that we should all consort with\nhomosexuals, love our neighbours\nand breast feed Somali babies. It\nmay have been less than polite to\nsite the two prominent homosexuals\nin the college, but after all, how can\nyou be flippant without looking into\nthe face of Imperial College; and\nyou are in the face of Imperial\nCollege. At the same time you must\nget people coming up to you saying\n\"Oh you're so brave dahl ing, those\nbastards, those bastards I Do come\nround for a tofu sandwich\nsometime.\" I think for the new\nbourg oise it's trendy to like gay\npeople, and I have never said\nanything else. If Samin wat s is name or yourself want to take me out of\ncontext, then there it is, but I'm confident that I stand with an egg-free face.\nPink for Girls\nDear Anna\nI was surprised and pleased to\nfind your letter in Felix. But I think\nyou would be surprised about how\nfew people have noticed the\nquestionnaire - I know because I was walking around asking people\nand most had not even heard of it!\nThis was also well demonstrated\nduring the last UGM of the summer\nterm, when a spontaneous motion\ndemanded that the results should\nnot be allowed to be published\nbecause the questions were\nleading. When it was asked how\nmany people knew the\nquestionnaire, only a handful of\npeople did. Unfortunately they\ndecided I am not to publish any of\nthe findings. This is a real pity: the\nreaction was very diverse, and\ngives quite a bit of insight into\nmany aspects of the life of female\nstudents. And it would have been a lot better to let individuals decide\nfor themselves after reading about\nthe results, rather than to force the\nopinion of a few on the rest of the\ncollege.\nI know now that the\nquestionnaire could have been set\nup in a different way. When I published it I honestly believed that\nthe contents would not offend\nanybody, as I had asked many\nfriends (male and female) whether\nthey could find anything 'sensitive'\nand I consider aggressive\narguments counterproductive.\nI had also hoped that some\nchaps would come forward with\nwhat they thought, but sadly there\nhas not been any response of that\nkind at all; it seems I was too\nsubtle l However, I have asked\nmany of my male friends whether\nthey have ever been harassed, and\nif anything they said that they have\nexperienced something like 'a minor nuisance' (to use your\nwords). A few went far enough to\nsay that they have felt threatened\nby male attention, in contrast to\nfemale attention. And some of\nthem were worried on the streets at\nnight, but because of potential\nmale rapist rather than some scary\nfemales.\nThe survey was intended to\nsample opinions and to trigger a discussion about the subject (which\nfinally might come about, thanks to\nyou, Anna). Some women greatly\nwelcomed the interest in their\nsituation. Some people seemed to\nbelieve that I was eager to get as\nmany complaints as possible. And,\ngiven the feeling that the questions\nwere 'leading', some of them have\nlittle confidence in their colleagues\nif they believe that they can be\nmanipulated so easily! (\nI am aware\nthat there have been cases where\nsuggestive hypnosis resulted in\nmade-up abuse memories etc - but\nthis would be grossly\noverestimating the influence I could\nhave even if I wanted!) I would be\nhappiest if there were no\ncomplaints at all, and the post of\nWomen's Officer was completely\nuncalled for. This is not yet the case\n(although the situation is not too\nbleak either!)..\nA few women demanded that I apologise to the whole male\npopulation of Imperial, which I am\nabsolutely willing to do (including\nto those that told me it was alright):\nI apologise - no offense intended.\nThe women who come to\nImperial must know that there is a strong male majority, and the fact\nthat they come here after all\nindicates that they feel reasonably\nrelaxed about this. In fact, I do not\nknow of any females here who\n'view contact with men with\nextreme prejudice'. I assume many\nof them indulge in male company\nas much as I do.\nThe problem with something\nlike harassment is that it is very\nsubjective. Some women do not\nmind jokes that others consider to\nbe insulting. You might not mind\nbeing called a rhinoceros by your\nneighbours but if you do you can\ntake them to court. So why should\none be less upset about remarks\nthat aim at your gender? Why is it\nthat complaints in this direction are so often considered to be petty and\nsad?\nI agree that many harass ers are\nnot aware of the agony they are\ncausing, and certainly counselling\nis a far more useful tool to deal\nwith such cases than punishments.\nHowever just telling the harass er to\nstop is not always effective.\nCertainly you are right in saying\nthat it is shy and insecure people\nwho get most molested, whether\nmale or female, and who\nconsequently find it hard to\nconfront their harass ers. However, I am certain that many 'normally\nconfident' women also sometimes\nfind it difficult to make it clear that\nthey feel uncomfortable about a situation. After all, one does not\nwant to seem\npetty/impolite/tactless/horrible etc.\nIn fact, it happens that women\nworry whether they might be\noverreacting and hysterical.\nSobetter shut up and endure\nwhatever?\nI do not consider it a good idea\nto treat women with velvet gloves.\nOtherwise they might enter a job\nand suddenly find themselves in a world they cannot deal with.\nInstead, it is important to make\nsure that women are self-assertive\nenough to deal with the problems\nthey might encounter. For this it\ncan help to know that there are\npeople who take your problems\nseriously, and that you feel\nIf FELIX M10U94 "

Sir\nRonald has told FELIX that the\nCVCP was the agency chosen by\nGovernment to introduce this\nguidance, emphasising that it\nwas the Government itself which\nhad drawn up the controversial\nlist of countries and subjects.\nHowever, Dr John Hassard,\nLecturer in the Physics\nDepartment, has criticised the\nlist of countries insisting that\nsome of them are extremely\nresponsible, contrary to\nGovernment indications. He\ncites Pakistan, not a signatory of\nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (NNPT), as having\nrefused an approach from Libya\nof $100 million for nuclear\ntechnology. The method of\nnaming countries, which\nincludes N NPT signatories,\nseems to contain a certain\namount of 'racism' suggests Dr\nHassard, with Britain telling\nothers that they are not\nresponsible enough to have\nnuclear weapons.\nThe Government has made\nit clear that the list of countries\nis 'subject to amendment in the\nlight of changed circumstances'.\nThe Rector commented that\nwith the involvement of many\ndifferent Government depart-ment s, this is basically a diplomatic matter.\nDr Hassard is extremely\nsceptical about the advantages of\nthis vetting process, suggesting\nthat a much broader range of\nmeasures is needed if Britain is\nto counter the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons. He added that\nit is the trade in nuclear\nmaterials that must be addressed,\nrather than that of information\nwhich will always be available.\nIn 1979, an Iraqi PostDoctoral student who had\ncarried out research in Imperial's High Energy Physics group\nreturned to Iraq to set up its\nnuclear weapons programme.\nThe present leader of the\nprogram is also an ex-student of\nImperial College.

The usual domination of collecting by the Royal\nCollege of Science Union (RCSU) has been overturned and City and Guilds\nCollege (C& GCU) are firmly in the lead. However, The Royal School of\nMines Union (RSMU), doesn't seem to have entered into the collection with\nas much enthusiasm. The breakdown for each of the Constituent College\nUnions is as follows: C& GCU \u00a31828, RCSU \u00a31403.10, RSMU \u00a35.25.\nMoney raised will go to many charities, including the Systic Fibrosis Trust.\n\"Be mad, be silly, be part of it.\" For more on Rag and Rag Week, see\nthe pullout in the centre of this edition.\nembarrassed by this, the Rector\nstressed that these measures are\npart of a much larger initiative\nby the British and other\nGovernments. He insisted that\nthe process is voluntary, with the\nfinal decision being up to the\ninstitution's discretion. Sir\nRonald defended the usefulness\nof the measures, saying that even\nif only a small number of cases\nare affected, it could serve its\npurpose and reassure nervous\nuniversities.\nInstitutions will be expected\nto submit details of candidates'\nacademic and employment\nbackground to the Government,\nalong with details about their\nproposed course and length of\nstudy.

Nothing you can do\nabout that.\nAnd he leaves the great royal\nempire, quietly weaves his way\nthrough the throng of courtiers, to\nhis home in a nutshell.\ntaken from 'The Dimension of\nthe Present Moment', M. Holub,\n(available from the Haldane\nlibrary 891.86 HOL)\ngraphics and words by Jon Jordan\nThe discourse which has occurred between\npoets and scientists has not been voluminous.\nYet it has displayed certain characteristic\ntraits. Prior to the Newtonian revolution\nthere was a commonly held view that both\nthe poet and the natural philosopher (as the\nscientist was then termed) were engaged in\nthe same sort of world. Just as natural\nphilosophy concerned itself with such ideals\nas the mysteries of life and alchemy, both of\nthese programmes being linked by an\nunderlying belief in the unity of nature, so\nthe poets dreamed within the same paradigm.\nIt was in the wake of Newton that the\nbreak was made. The poet Samuel Taylor\nColeridge made this explicit with his\nfamous comparison: \"I believe\nthe souls of five\nhundred Sir Isaac\nNewtons would\ngo to the\nmaking up of a Shakespeare\nor a Milton\".\nIt is\ninteresting that\nColeridge was\nnot 'anti-science'.Indeed\nhe maintained a friendship with\nHumphry Davy,\namongst other\nprominent natural\nphilosophers of his day.\nRather Coleridge was critical\nof the change of spirit that\nNewtonianism brought and to a great extent\nthis is the situation that remains today.\nParadoxically, however, the\nstereotypical view of scientists is that 'it is\nobvious that science and poetry are\nsynonymous'. Obviously few suggest that the\ndisciplines are the exactly the same but the\nconsensus view amongst scientists is that they\nare as good at doing poetry as anyone else. In\nfact when it comes to scientific poetry it's true that scientists are the only poets.\nPlugging into CP Snow mode, when 'we' are\ndoing a poem about the second law of\nthermodynamics, say, both the writing and\nunderstanding of the resulting opus is limited\nto scientists as no-one else even understands\nthe underlying concept involved!\nIt was with such thoughts in mind that\nI ventured to the bastion of art in ess that is\nthe Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) for\na lecture called 'Transfusions: science into\npoetry'. Of the three speakers only one\nresonated. His name was Miroslav Holub.\nMiroslav has had a varied career, as\nalways seems to be the case with such people.\nAn early training in greek and latin lead on\nto the study of medicine, philosophy and\nhistory of science and pathology. He became\nthe editor of the Czech equivalent of New\nScientist, an international expert in the\nimmunology of 'nude mice', the author of\nfourteen books of poetry and also gained the\npolitical stature of someone who was a 'non-person' between 1970-1980,\nthanks to the Czech\ngovernment. So if anyone\nis a good example of\nthe two culture in\none, it is Miroslav.\nPerhaps the most\nsurprising phrase\nhe uttered that\nentire night was\n\"science\ncorrodes the\nsoul of the\npoet\".\nAs a stand\nalone item this is an\nextremely provoking\nstatement but what does\nit actually mean? In\npersonal terms Miroslav\nrecognised several differences\nbetween science and poetry.\nFor example scientists don't use as\nmany different ideas and words as poets.\nScientists don't deal with personal issues in\ntheir work - instead they stick to universal\nconcerns. Scientists don't answer useful\nquestions, only solvable ones. In this way you\ncan not be a( good) poet whilst acting as a scientist. There is a duality in roles.\nPerhaps this is made more clear by the\npoem on the left, Zito the Magician. As\nMiroslav comments, \"in the use of words and\nstatements poetry and science move in\ndifferent and opposite directions\". They are\nnot concerned with the same things so we\nshould not attempt to make them so.\nThefinal lecture in the ICA series, 'Taking\nthe pulse: poetry examined' is held on the 23rd of\nNovember at 7.30pm, box office 0171 930 3647.\n* Miroslav Holub\nimmunologist [of mice] and\npoet [of men]\nFELIX\n\n"

It tells the story\nof the titular ship 'Dark Star' with its sex i ly voiced computer and a ded crew, whose job it\nis to locate unstable suns and nuke them\nbefore they go nova. The problem is, the\nbombs which they use have personalities and\nwhen one is forced to return to the bomb bay\ndue to an electrical fault, it doesn't see why it\nshouldn't just go ahead and detonate anyway.\nWrapped into this are subplots involving\nderanged elevators, the ship's dead captain\nkept in stasis in the freezer compartment, and\nan alien pet which kind of resembles a beach-ball with rubber claws.\nAlthough the film's student short origins\nand low low budget are very evident, it\nremains the finest SF parody on film due to\nits oddball humour and moments of pure\ngenius; watch the existential conversation\nwith the strop py bomb, or Sergeant Pinback\n(who's not entirely who he should be) berating the 'cute' alien with a broom and call me\na liar.\nEntrance is \u00a31.50 for members or \u00a32.00 for\nnon-members.

The fourth film is on\nSunday at 8pm, with Christopher Lambert\nstarring in Fortress. Lots of action that will\nset your blood pumping.\nwho: Astro Soc\nWhat: Plug for Astronomy\nKeys: Telescope, Dawn French\nPicture this. A clear, moon less night\nsky. A great panoply of stars shine like gimlet\neyes above... above a garden behind an otherwise anonymous house. Shrouded by the\nnight, a clock chimes thrice as half a dozen\nanorak-clad figures mutter excitedly about\nthe luminosity of the Pleiades while performing what could best be described as a cross\nbetween a Mancunian rain dance and a mosh\naround a telescope.\nThis is not a satanic ritual. This is not\nsome form of teenage rebellion. This is not\neven a very low key protest against the criminal justice bill. These are people who have\nchosen to take an interest in what lies beyond\nour home planet; in astronomy. Believe what\nyou will, but astronomy/astrophysics can be a fascinating subject. Yes, it is true that at\ntimes it's heavier than the offspring of\nRussell Grant, Dawn French, and two dozen\nboxes of Milk Tray - but it can, and does\nhave its moments.\nIt must have. Some very interesting people in the media have based their fame on\ntheir work in this field - Patrick Moore, Carl\nSagan, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C Clarke, to\nname an obvious few.\nSo at last, we come to the point of this\ntext. It's a plug for AstroSoc. The\nAstronomical Society caters for those who\nlike to show off that they've spent many a Friday and Saturday night memo rising the\nclassification of every star visible to the naked\neye; as well as the less zealous who are just\ngenerally interested in the subject.\nAstroSoc usually holds at least one lecture every fortnight, as well as the odd trip to\nplaces of relevant interest such as the planetarium at the start of term. Demand allowing,\nwe would also like to organise a weekend trip\nto the Silwood park campus, whose telescope\ncan offer us a superior view of the stars and\nwhose bar can offer us a rather hazy view of\nthe rising sun.\nOur next lecture will be on the 15th of\nNovember, and the guest speaker (with the\naid of 3D glasses and slides produced by a computer) will give a talk entitled, 'The\nUniverse on a Micro'. This will be in lecture\ntheatre one, on level one of Blackett. Signs\nwill be plastered around Blackett and Huxley\nfor the direction ally challenged.\nLectures we have planned for later in the\nyear include the talks, 'The Search for\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence', 'The Voyager 2\nmission at Uranus', and one about the existence of UFOs. We are assured that David Ike\nwill not be mentioned, nor will little green\nmen wielding casio keyboards playing the\ntheme to 'Close Encounters'.\nAnnual membership is a measly one pound.\nTo join or just have a chat, simply turn up to any\nof the lectures.\nwho Outdoor\nWhat: Peak District\nKeys: Cream Teas, Climbing\nLate at night on the tube; the beggars are asking each other for 20p and the crazy man in\nthe corner is trying to convert you to his re li gion. Haven't you ever felt the urge to get out\nof London for the weekend? To go where\nKamikaze Mercedes are rarer than a cheery\nsmile from the staff in Sainsbury\"s? On October 21st,16 people headed\nNorth in search of adventure... or at least a reasonably-priced pint. Pausing only for the\nusual Edgware Road jam, we were eventually\nspeeding our way towards the Peak District.\nOur accommodation for the weekend was\na village hall and it was here that the normal\nSaturday morning faff occurred as we looked\nout to see low clouds and rain. Three mountain bikers set off on a30 mile jaunt across\nthe hills, whilst the remainder went climbing,\nhalf outside chancing the wet conditions and\nhalf at an indoor climbing wall in Sheffield.\nA highlight of the day's climbing was watching Olivier leading up a Severe rock climb\nwhich might more reasonably have been\ncalled a small waterfall.\nAfter our evening meal we adjourned to\nthe pub across the road, which unfortunately\nshowed no signs of closing at eleven - it's a hard life! Sunday gave the less adventurous a chance to go walking (to a cafe for a cream\ntea) whilst the die-hard rock climbers visited\nStanage Edge. The rock was initially quite\ndamp but thanks to a raging gale it was soon\ndry and we enjoyed some good climbing, if a little windswept at times. The evening\nbrought the London-ward rush with\nthoughts of Monday 9.00am lectures resurfacing after the excellent weekend.\nSo if you're into walking, climbing,\nmountain biking or cream teas then come\nalong and see us. New members and total\nbeginners are always welcome. You can come\non one trip before deciding whether to join us\nor not. Coming up is a weekend in\nSnowdonia (Nov 18th20 th) one to the\nLake District (Dec 2nd4 th) and the winter\ntour to the Cairngorms in Scotland.\nYou can sign up for trips or find out more at\nthe weekly meetings on Tuesdays from 12.00pm till 2.00pm in Southside Lounge.\n\n"

Take Flesh and Bone\nfor instance. A family are murdered\nduring a robbery and only the baby\nsurvives. Twenty years later that\ngrown baby [Meg Ryan) gets\ninvolved with the son of the trigger\nhappy thug who shot them. She's been told that her family were\nkilled in a car crash but the son\n(Dennis Quaid) knows the truth.\nAnd then the father (James Caan)\nturns up. Tenuous is probably the\nmost charitable thing you can say.\nYet for all its un be liev ability you do\ncome away from Flesh and Bone\nwith some feeling of perverted\nsatisfaction.\nIn part it's to do with the solid\nperformances of the actors. Quaid's character, Arlis, plows the lonely\ninterstate of life, filling vending\nmachines with blue chickens called\nBetty, cans of chilli and boxes of\npro phyla tics. More than a creature\nof habit, he has become a hermit of\nthe road. The landscapes he\nencounters are flat, horizontally\nbound, dusty and most importantly,\nempty. His father and his childhood\nhave reduced him to a hollow man,\nemotionally bereft. Ryan is always\nat home with her home girl gone\nslightly skew y character and Caan\nplays the grizzled old wolf with two\ndimensional ease. Still the problem\nis that these players never connect\nbe liev ably within the stretch of\ncredibility which the plot asks us to\nbelieve is cinematic reality.\nOnly the end scene really\nworks and that because it plugs\nstraight into the bedrock of Quaid's character. No romantic foolery\nhere, even with his real life wife.\nJust as the camera pans from a fuzzy image of blonde hair and\ncowboy boots up and out to the\nstraight edged Texan plains so,\nalbeit briefly, we can see the wider\npicture. A film with good genes, it\njust needed a bit of free thinking\nrebellion somewhere along the line.\nThe Rank preview theatre is a sleaze-free zone. Pundits are not\nplied with bowls of peanuts, plates\nof sandwiches or other disincentive s to objectivity. In fact, for this\nparticular film it would have been a bit of a waste. Even a sackful of\ntortilla chips would not have caused\nyour sea-green incorruptible critic\nto swerve from his duty of revealing\nto the world the truly dire nature of\nDream Lover.\nIn a film that has nothing\nwhatsoever to do with snooker,\nJames Spader plays Ray Reardon, a rich, handsome yuppie architect\nand all-round smoothie. Ray's most\ndistinctive feature is the habit of\nbaring his top teeth in a ric tus that\nleaves the viewer unsure whether\nhe is about to laugh, sneer or bite\nsomeone. He falls for Lena\n(Mddchen Am/ck), who tells him she\nwas abused by her parents. This I can believe, since her sultry pout\nlooks like the result of having had\nher lips clamped together with\nclothes pegs throughout her\nchildhood.\nThey shag (but on the second\ndate, not the first - who says\nHollywood isn't setting a high moral\ntone?) they marry, they have kids.\nBut Ray begins to suspect that his\nperfect partner has a past murkier\nthan the drab shades of lipstick she\nfavours. He starts to dream that\nhe's in a tacky circus arcade, trying\nto win the ideal wife. Is he\nparanoid? Is she a psycho after his\nlucre? Slack and unoriginal, the\nplot spirals into ludicrousness when\nRay lands up in the loony-bin. (\nI began to suspect that Lena is kinky\nand wants to be abused, but then\nI'm just a chauvinist male who's seen Blue Velvet.) If you're unlucky\nenough to find yourself at this film,\ndo what Ray should have done and\nget out after the f* ck scene.\nMy Life's in Turnaround is a low budget independent film from\nAmerica. At the start of the film,\nSplick (Eric Shaeffer) and Jason\n(Donald Ward) are two pretty\naimless people. Splick works as a cab driver and Jason is a bar\ntender. Splick is having troubles\ntrying to find the right woman,\nwhile Jason, (long haired and with\nago a tie beard) is surrounded with\n'fourteen' year old models. Their\nmeans of self expression to the\npublic is via the stage with a mixture of verse and a play on\nwords, which lasts seconds and is\ntotally incomprehensible. So after\nmany scathing reviews they decide\nto turn their attention to film.\nHowever they have no script,\nmoney or stars.\nThe whole script is loaded with\nhilarious one liners and sharp and\nwell constructed scenes. It proved\nto be thoroughly entertaining. One\nof its many subplots is a rant\nagainst the Hollywood industry. In\none scene they have a meeting with\na 'big' producer. After asking them\nif their film was a 'Harry Met Sally'\nor a 'Lethal Weapon' type film, he\nthrows them out of a restaurant for\nsaying that the film was a documentary about themselves.\nSlackers!\nHopefully this film will end up\nin a cinema, but you never can tell\nwith low budget films, especially\nthose that send up Hollywood and^\nall that. \u00a9\nFELIX\n\n"

This was meant to be\ndone about 2 years ago but has not been. I am in negotiations with College Security\nabout the cost of the new system.\nRooms\nAfter the Bar Managers Flat had had new\nlocks fitted, RAG came up with a proposal\nthat the room they were meant to move to\nwas too small. It was discussed and passed at\nan Exec meeting that RAG would move into\nthe existing Clubs & Societies store room\nbehind the Union\nDining Hall. The storage lockers would be\nmoved into what was meant to be the RAG\nroom in the Flat and the existing Jazz and\nRock room in the basement of Beit. These\nmoves will be taking place when sufficient\ndiscussions have taken place with the\nSocieties involved.\nThe Princes Mews Garage space problem is\nbeing looked into by a working party chaired\nby Dan Look.\nWorld Wide Web\nAs the Events and Marketing Manager is\nleaving the Union I will be responsible for\nmaintaining the Unions www pages. These\nare still under construction at the moment\nbut will, hopefully, be operational by next\nterm. Most of the Clubs & Societies now have\ne mail accounts and I am waiting for them to\nsee me to open the accounts. Clubs &\nSocieties will have to wait before creating\nwww pages. This is due to College currently\nworking on a College-wide policy on\nstudents having their own www pages. The\nresults of this committee, which I sit on,\nshall be known in January.\nSports\nWe are now nearing the end of the Block\nFixtures and within two weeks I will know\nwhich of the Imperial College teams have\nmade it into the next round. College have\nappointed a new Sports and Leisure Manager,\nFrank Murray. His brief is to develop a College Sports Strategy. College can not\nclaim money from the National Lottery\nunless it has a Sports Strategy. Frank has\nworked in Universities before and is very\nkeen on student sport. We shall wait and see\nhow his new job works out.\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(Finance and Services)\nReport to UGM\nby Dan Look\nTreasurers Training:\nThese first few weeks of the year have been\nvery busy for myself and the Union Finance\nManager as we have been training all the\nPresidents/Chairs/Treasurers in the ways of\nthe Union's finances. This has more or less\nbeen completed, with the Treasurers of all the\nMSC/CCU's now happily (?) installed in their\npositions.\nUnion Finance Committee:\nSince the last UGM the first UFC meeting of\nterm took place where the two main items of\nbusiness were the \"trimming\" of the Union's reserves and the review of our subsidy rates.\nBoth of these items need to be concluded in\nsome way at the next meeting (November\n10th),I will report the decisions made after\nthis time.\nRefectory Services:\nThis committee has met once already this\nterm where a policy stating that \"strippers are\nprohibited from public places within the\nUnion\" was agreed (as reported to Council).\nThe Committee meets again on November\n14th to discuss the annual accounts for last\nyear. I shall report verbally on the outcome.\nBookstore Committee:\nThis committee has also already met once\nthis term where the performance of the new\nNewsagent was discussed. Although still an\nearly stage in its life it appears to be doing\nvery well, pushing total sales well above last\nyears level. This committee will also meet on\nNovember 14th to discuss last year's accounts, again I shall report verbally on the\noutcome.\nMinibuses:\nIt appears that any standard driving licences\nissued after 1 July 1996 will not be a licence\nto drive vehicles with over 8 passenger seats.\nThis will clearly fundamentally affect the\noperation of our minibus fleet. I am still in\nthe process of trying to get more information.\nAccomodation:\nI have had some meetings with College over\naccommodation related matters but to be\nhonest that's about it. The main problem\nbeing very limited feedback from the student\npopulation. This either means that our halls\nof residence are near perfect or that people\nare not aware of the fact that the Union may\nbe able to help with any complaints. If\nanybody has any comments or queries\nconcerning accommodation please get in touch.\nPRESIDENT\nReport to UGM\nby Lucy Chottia\nConstitution\nThe amendments passed at the last U GM have been made. The revised Constitution is\nnow available from the reception desk in the\nUnion office. It will be submitted to this\nUGM for its second reading.\nAcademic Affairs\nCouncil met on the l st of November. It\nagreed to my rewriting the Academic Affairs\nConstitution with the assistance of the\nConstituent College Union Academic Affairs\nOfficers. I will be meeting with them on the\n9th November to discuss the structure the\nAcademic Affairs should take in the future. I will inform UGM verbally of the outcome of\nthis meeting.\nThe Russell Group\nOn the 10th October I received a telephone\ncall from the LSE General Secretary, Martin\nLewis. He informed me that there had been\nan article in the Observer newspaper stating\nthat the vice-chancellors of 9 Universities and\nColleges had met in the Russell Hotel to\ndiscuss forming a separate fee paying SuperLeague. He suggested the Union Presidents\nfor the 9 mentioned institutions meet to pool\nideas.\nOn the 17th October the Union\nPresidents of UL, Manchester, Cambridge\npostgraduate Union, LSE and IC met.\nNothing was concluded except that they\nshould meet again.\nOn the 20th October I met with the\nRector. The Rector assures me that there is\nnothing sinister about the Vice-Chancellors\nmeeting and that they are not thinking of\nforming a Super-League. I was also told they\nmeet as representatives of the large research\nbased institutions in order to lobby the\nGovernment as a group.\nOn the l st of November the Unions\nagain met and talked at great length with\nlittle result.\nJob Agency\nCollege at present need various part time staff\nfor cleaning and reception type jobs. These\nstaff are needed to work during the evenings.\nA number of students need work. The Union\nis therefore setting up an index of students\nwho need work. The idea being that College\nuse these people rather than seeking\nemployment externally. The Estates\nDivision appear to be in some confusion as to\nwhat work they actually have available. The\nUnion has therefore contacted all Heads of\nDepartment, CAD and Registry informing\nthem that we have students available for\nwork.\nIT T FELIX1100091 "

He says, \"Animals\nare far better than we are at\ntolerating stress.\"\nBY ANDREW SMITH\nImperial College has this week\nsubmitted revised, downsized\nplans for the new Basic Medical\nSciences (BMS) building.\nThe new building, also to\ninclude the Biology Department,\nwas originally costed at \u00a372\nmillion. Following informal\ndiscussions with the HEFCE\nworking group, Imperial College\nhas downgraded its estimates by\n\u00a3 ll m. Dr Rodney Eastwood,\nDeputy Director of Estates, has\nconfirmed to FELIX that the\nproposed spending of \u00a362m is\nofficially being split into \u00a345m for the medical side, and the\nsame original estimate of \u00a316m for the Biology part.\nDr Eastwood has admitted\nthat negotiations are at a very\ndelicate stage with the concerned\nparties, which include the three\nwest London postgraduate\nmedical schools. The removal of\nstudents from the two hospital\nsites may also result in funding\nfrom the Department of Health\n(DoH), following the possible\nsale of the area vacated by\npre clinical personnel. The\nmedical part of the BMS\nbuilding should be 100%\nexternally funded according to\nDr Eastwood, with the new\nImperial College Medical School\naccepting undergraduates in\nOctober 1998.\nFELIX has learned that the\nBiology part of the building will\nonly be 25% funded by HEFCE,\nthe extra \u00a312 million having to\nbe met by Imperial College. Mr\nMike Hansen, Director of\nFinance, has insisted that there\nwill not be a problem finding\nthis money, either internally\nthrough College funds or\nexternally by borrowing from\nbanks. He said that the 'most\nappropriate manner of financing\nwould be decided at the time\naccording to Imperial's financial\nforecast and tax efficiency'.\nThe combined intake of up\nto 1000 extra students on the\nSouth Kensington site, will force\nthe introduction of extra student\nfacilities. While no extension of\nUnion space has been agreed, the\nremoval of the Biology\nDepartment from the Beit Quad\nwill leave possibilities open for\nthe redevelopment of that area\ninto student accommodation.\nThe lack of any medical library\nfacilities in the Central Library\nhas resulted in the inclusion in\nthe plans of an extra floor on top\nof the present building. This\nwould include a new 350 seat\nlecture theatre which would in\npart replace those in the Old\nChemistry building, which is\ndue to be demolished.\nWith the proposal to start\nbuilding during the end of 1995,\nthe Biology Department is said\nto welcome the move to new\npurpose-built facilities, where it\nwill share certain equipment\nwith the medical schools. St\nMary's students are somewhat\napprehensive about the move,\nbut their President, Claire\nMaloney, has guardedly welcomed the plans. With a large\ncanteen, and space for the new\nConstituent College Union\noffices included in the proposals,\nMiss Maloney said that it is\nlooking, \"all right as far as\nrecreational space is concerned.\"\nDr Eastwood emphasised\nthat all these plans are\ndependent on the approval of\nfunds from HE FCE and the\nDoH, and that final allocation of\nspace will only be decided after\nthe commitment of these bodies.\n\u00a9Ji/ori aL It has been a couple years now\nsince I went through my\ndepressed and delayed post-adolescent trauma. Feeling\nprofoundly disillusioned, I read\nthrough the philosophers until I got to the existentialists and ran\naway. I read of political ideals\nand swung left to right and back\nagain more times than Attila the\nHun on a playground swing. I was the kind of communist who\nwas too anarchic to ever get\ntogether and who, besides, was\nstudying a degree in order to,\npresumably, make lots of money.\nLike the majority of people\nwho stare at books or the wall too\nlong, I started to see nothing but\nmy shadow and the thin cracks\nwhich run through everything. I got to the point where I realised\nthat all anyone really has is\nthemselves: not only in terms of\nsomeone to rely on or to truly\nunderstand but in the sense that\nthe only place where most of us\ncan embody our ideas is within.\nHow many of the great thinkers\nwere ever able to put their ideas\ninto practice? All doctrine is\ncorrupted once implemented and\nbesides, a doctrine isn't the sum\nof a person's beliefs, it's more like\na newspaper photograph of the\nmoon. White but made of holes,\nonly an approximation which on\nthe macro scale appears fine but\nunder close inspection falls apart.\nLife is more subtle and chaotic\nthan the old ideas could dream of.\nHow many of us really think\nabout fidelity to our beliefs? I realised a couple of weeks ago,\nduring the Careers Fair, that I have all but forgotten the concept\nof getting a job or responsibly\nsorting my life out. I 've had\nideas, the kind you would expect\nof a computer science trained\narty-editor, but mostly the\nfeeling has been the long leftover\n'I 'll write a book and it will\nvindicate anything I do, however\nmediocre.' The only way to\nproceed was to stand still and let\nthe rest of the banal, author-it arian, screwed up world proceed\nin its weary way.\nMaybe I'm getting old but\nthis doesn't seem good enough\nanymore. I'm afraid of waking up\nthirty five years old with nothing\nto show for my conviction that\nthe world was a bad place but\na lifetime avoiding it.\nThis week a rather unique\nindividual from the crew on the\nright has made me think about\nmaking my place within it.\nPulling people together and, in\nsome small but brilliant way,\nmaking things happen. Talks\nabout forming a company of like-minded spirits and burning true\nto your ideals - avoiding the\nbureaucratic multi-layered\nindustrial landscape like a pre-revolutionary plague.

    "content": "Feature\nWould you eat a tomato that's been genetically engineered to last longer, or t better?4m' reports from the first UK Consensus Conference on Plant\nBiotechnology, where the public gave their answer, and put...\nScience on Trial\nThere is growing disillusionment with our\npolitical system and politicians. We complain\nthat \"they're not doing their job\", or \"they're\nin cahoots with big business, lining each o th ers' pockets\". But is there anything we can do\nabout it?\nWell, last week the Science Museum\ntried to make governments and business and\npressure groups listen to the public. The\nScience Museum and the Biotechnology and\nBiological Science Research Council organised\nthe UK's first National Consensus Conference\non the subject of plant biotechnology. This\ncould be the start of a new democratic process,\na new way of connecting the public with decisions made for the public.\nAs the Science Museum says, this was\n\"an unconventional contribution to public\ndebate and public decision making\" - unconventional debate in the sense that a panel consisting of 16 members of the public is given\nfree rein to invite experts to answer any questions the lay panel puts to them. On the basis\nof these answers the panel writes an independent report. The unconventional nature of\nthe decision making is that no-one who\nactually makes the decisions has to listen\nto the panel. The initial signs were not\ngood. William Waldegrave MP, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries\nand Food, was billed to open the\nconference, He could not attend\ndue to \"cabinet business\".\nConsensus conferences\nstarted in Denmark, to collect the \"unfiltered views\nof the people\" on issues\nsuch as food ir radi a tion, road transport\nand electronic identity cards. Denmark\nhas a much\nstronger tradition of consulting its citizens\nthan we do, so it\nremains to be\nseen how much\nnotice will be\ntaken of this conference in the\nUK.\nThe organisers advertised\nin local newspapers throughout\nthe country ask-FELIX\ning for volunteers. Over 360 people (including\nmyself) applied for the 16 places on the lay\npanel. The panel was chosen to be representative of the UK's population - equal numbers\nof men and women from a wide range of social\nclasses, geographical areas and ethnic groups.\nNone of the panel had any experience or particular knowledge of plants or biotechnology.\nA couple of months before the conference\nstarted, the panel was given two intensive\nweekends of introduction to the basics of\nbiotechnology. First, they addressed issues\nsuch as how biotechnology works, and how it\nmight affect society, the economy and the\nenvironment. Second, they identified seven\nkey questions (see box on facing page) and\nchose appropriate experts to give evidence\nduring the conference, which took place in\nRegent's Park on 2 - 4 November .\nSo when we, the audience, arrived at the\nconference to hear the questions, the lay\npanel, as one of them said, had been \"living\nand breathing plant biotechnology for the past\n2 months.\" Each expert was given 5 minutes\nfor their answer. For example, the first question was answered by a professor at the John\nInnes Centre, an employee of Zeneca Seeds\n(formerly ICI), a representative of Greenpeace\nand a representative of the National\nFederation of Consumer Groups. The fourth\nquestion was addressed by a professor of moral\nphilosophy, an Anglican vicar and a representative of the Vegetarian Society. After the\nanswers, the lay panel questioned the expert\nwitnesses more deeply on the issues raised.\nAt the beginning of the conference all\nsides treated it as another platform for their\npropaganda, not as a genuine forum for dialogue with the public.\nThere was a distinct lack of consensus\nfrom the speakers answering the first ques-tion. Prof. Dick Flavell of the John Innes\nCentre conveniently ran out of time before\naddressing the risks of plant biotechnology.\nDr Sue Mayer of Greenpeace could find no\nbenefits outside the research lab for plant\nbiotechnology. Both sides were attempting to\nuse methods of disinformation; presenting\nconjecture as fact and trying to scare the\npanel with hypothetical horror stories. Dr\nMayer talked of genetic pollution and\ntransformed cereals becoming voracious weeds. Dr Ed Dart of Zeneca\nSeeds told us the world's population\nwas set to rise from today's2.4 billion to 12 billion by 2150 and thus\nbiotechnology would be necessary to feed the world. (2150 is\nabout seven generations\naway.) If the world cannot\nfeed 12 billion people with\nor without biotechnology,\nthen there will never be\n12 billion people on the\nplanet. And as another\ncontributor said, \"You\ncan't feed the world\nwith tomatoes and cot-ton\" - the main crops\nbeing enhanced by\nbiotechnology at pre-sent. Interestingly,\nProf. Flavell and Dr\nDart addressed the\naudience whereas Dr\nMayer and Jill Moore\nof the National\nFederation of\nConsumer Groups\n\n"

    "content": "Rag Week Pull Out Rag Week Pull Out\nComedy Night\nRag week this year kicks off with a comedy night. This will be featuring Boothby Graffoe and Tim Vine, the evening will be topped off\nwith a disco, and a late bar. Tickets are priced \u00a32.50 and are available\nfrom the union office, or pay at the door. Doors open at 8pm and the\nshow starts at 8.30pm. Rag Raid\nLocation unknown (well, England somewhere). Opportunity to meet\nstudents from another university and see what pathetic and dreary\nlives they lead. We cheer them up by selling them IC rag mags (of fen sive, racist, sexist, subversive, anarchic, etc.). Common response is\nalong the lines of:\n\"Want to buy an IC rag mag?\"\n\"Got no money.\"\n\"It's highly offensive and has been banned from your campus.\"\n50p mysteriously appears very fast and you can rest in the knowledge\nthat you have brought happiness and cheer to a sad and lonely non-IC\nstudent.\nNote: We are on our best behaviour. On no account do we ever\ndescend in a large,rowdy mob, and e.g. take over their bar, buy\nall their beer, break into their union offices, re-arrange garden\nfurniture, re-paint walls, etc., and we definitely, most definitely do not nick any signs.\nMeet up in the carpark by the minibuses at 10am. Rag Bar Evening\nThis is where Raggies and anyone else who wants to converge on the\nUnion Bar and have a particularly excellent evening! We will be\nindulging in such silly things as 1001 Down Darts and other such daft\nbar games! We'll be there for a chat or any information that you may\nrequire so pop in and see us - we may even buy you a drink, depending\non how generous we're feeling at the time. But you'll be guaranteed a good nights entertainment if nothing else so come along and meet us!\nMines Dirty Disco\nHere's another on\nof the many\nchances during\nthe week to get\nyour clothes off\nfor charity! The\nMines Dirty\nDisco is, as the\nname implies a disco where the\ntheme is the less\nyou wear the less\nyou pay - therefore if you turn\nup in just a sock\n(if you are a man\nthat is), strategically placed of\ncourse, then you\nprobably would\nget in for free or\nhave to pay very\nlittle indeed. Of\ncourse no clothes\nmeans no cost!!\nICU Rag Week\nFri 11th Nov\nSat 12th Nov\nSun 13th Nov\nMon 14th Nov\nTue 15th Nov\nWed 16th Nov\nThur 17th Nov\nFri 18th Nov\nSat 19th Nov\nSat 19th Nov\nSun 20th Nov\nSun 20th Nov\nComedy Night\nRag Raid\nNight in the Bar\nMines Dirty Disco\nSlave Auction\nRCS Beer Festival\nRocky Horror Night\nRag Bash\nUnion Building\nSomewhere Far\nUnion Bar\nUnion Building\nUnion Building\nSherfield JCR\nUnion Building\nUnion Building\nSponsored Nude Kamikaze Somewhere Near\nParachute Jump\nPub Crawl\nRag Rugby\nBungee Jump\nSomewhere Nearer\nHarlington\nDocklands\nRoaches Thrive '95\nRocky Horror\nAt 8.00pm this Thursday is Rocky Horror night. Where we will be\nhaving a special screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show on the\nlarge screen in Da Vincis. This will be followed by a disco. Entrance is\nfree but we will expect you to make a donation to Rag. Just to add a twist to the evening we want everyone to come dressed in drag or in\nthe Rocky Horror theme. There will be prizes for the best costume.\nRag Bash\nUnion building, 7.00pm. Tickets \u00a33 and worth it, (what else is there to\nspend \u00a33 on? 5 pot noodles? 2 and eight elevenths JCR sandwiches?).\nThere will be live bands and a disco, a special cocktail bar with a live\njazz band and waiter/waitress service and much much more besides.\nThe weekend starts here and any work can wait...\nS.N.K. PJ.\nBy now you might have heard all about the Sponsored Nude\nKamikaze Parachute Jump, but for those of you that haven't then let\nme inform you. This is a little activity where a certain number of people jump out of the back of a minibus outside Harrods wearing nothing but bow ties and then proceed to make it back to college. This is\nusually done as rapidly as possible, but for the mad amongst you there\nis a prize for the last back to college! So if you fancy watching something silly on a Saturday morning then go and watch or for the more\ndaring of you - take part!!\nBungee Jump\nNormally people on a Sunday students would be lying in bed catching\nup on sleep and doing all the work they hadn't done all week, but not\ntoday! Loads of mad people are going of to London Docklands to\njump of a170 foot high crane and try to touch the water, all raising\nmoney for Tenovus, the cancer charity, whilst they fly through the air!\nThis is some thing people equate to sex or just plain adrenaline but\nwhatever your viewpoint on this spectacular event it should prove to\nbe excellent fun. If you want to do a jump there might just be enough\ntime for you sign up to do this but you will have to come and see us\nvery rapidly as places are limited and going fast!!\n5-legged Pub Crawl\nSelf explanatory, really. Technique is simple: Visit pub, buy drink,\ncollect money, buy drink, find another pub, buy drink, etc. Keep\ngoing until you feel dizzy, the room starts to spin, and weird creatures\nwalk across the ceiling. That's about it; start in Union Bar or Da\nVinci's, then make your way to Southside, probably followed by\nQueen's Arms, The Harrington, Hoop & Toy, Gloucester Arms,\nHereford Arms, Ennismore Arms, Stanhope Arms, etc. The 5-legged\nbit is to make it more of a challenge to stay upright and not get kicked\nout. Start time is after the SNKPJ and finish time is when there's noone left standing. Be there or be sober.\nKiller\nAlso this week we will be running Killer. The aim of this is to eliminate your target in the most original way you can think of. Be careful\nnot to get killed yourself as someone will be out to eliminate you. Once\nyou have killed someone, you then go on to try to kill their target. The\nwinner is the person left alive at the end of the week. To take part, go\nto the Rag office or the Union office before 5pm today. All you need\nare two passport photos of yourself, and \u00a32.50.\nThis year's incentives: \u00a350 - Mug, \u00a3150 - T Shirt, \u00a3500 - Sweatshirt, \u00a31000 - Rugby Shirt, \u00a31500 - Tankard\n\n"

This week, we return for a last look at the net with a review\nof the College's virtual net presence via the World Wide Web.\nCollege \u00a3\u2022 World Wide ll leb pages vary wildly in quality\nand content. The main College \u00a3 \u2022 homepage\n(http://www.ic.ac.uk) contains links into various\nservices, most of which contain little or no meat.\nSome work is needed here to liven up a very dull\npage! Clicking on the \"Acade-mic Departments\"\nCQhypertext links into (yup!) a list of IC departments\nand research centres. Only some of these entries\nlink into departmental \u00a30 homepages and none to\nresearch centres. (Some \u00a3\u2022 homepages were under con-struct ion). Aero had the best pic s, but not much\ncontent. Computer Science had loads of content (as\nexpected) although looked a little dull; it\nwas good to see coursework notes appearing in hypertext form and the pictorial\nwalk around College is fun! Physics is also excellent,\nwith research groups offering a great depth of excellent content and (gasp!) student society CQhomepages.\nThe Chemistry CQ homepage was by far the best of all,\noffering loads of info accessible in a very elegant and\nconsistent way and feeling well-used. Pity there's no\nICU, FELIX, or Student Society homepages\nthough. In summary - IC CQhomepages should look\ngreat and be useful and used. Most don't. Yet.\nfO Cyber lex World Wide Web - An 'agreement' between\nthousands of computers allowing W Wformatted requests for information to be\nreceived and serviced.

But it could\nhardly ask for a more effective promoter than its\nB3 webmaster, Dr\nHenry Rzepa.\n\"It's what scientific cooperation\nis all about\", says Dr Rzepa,\nwhose enthusiasm for all things\nNetlike even extends as far as\nposting family photographs in a distant corner of the page. He\ncan't understand why some\ndepartments are dragging their\nfeet in allowing undergraduate\naccess to the Net. \"We trust\nthem in the lab littered with\npotential hazards so why should-n't we trust them with computer\naccess?\" he says, pointing out\nthat chemistry\n, undergrads have\nbeen actively\nencouraged to\nuse email for six\nor seven years.\nAfter a title\nscreen with lots\nof welcoming\npictures, the\npage offers a wealth of C3hypertext\nlinks to what Dr Rzepa terms\n\"the world's best teaching materials in chemistry\" from various\ninternational sources.
