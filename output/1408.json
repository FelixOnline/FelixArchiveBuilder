Read the following comment pieces\n2. Check out www.live.cgcu.net for a televised NUS debate and further comment\n3. Consider the question: \u2018Should ICU remain affiliated with the NUS?\u2019\n4. Vote yes or no, now! Go online to www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\nVoting is now open in the NUS referendum. If you think ICU should remain affiliated to or should leave the\nNUS, head online to www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote. Voting closes at 23:59 on Monday 23rd June. Go!\n10 reasons to stay with the NUS\n1.\nStudents\u2019 Unions are\nmuch stronger and are\nin a better campaigning\nposition if they work together with regards to issues that affect students. Things such\nas Government policy on Higher Education funding can only be influenced\nby a united national campaign.\n2. After HSBC announced plans to\ncharge graduates interest on their\noverdrafts, the NUS led the national\ncampaign which resulted in HSBC\nscrapping their plans. This is one of\nmany examples when the NUS has\nwon battles for students.\n3. Without the NUS, students wouldn\u2019t\nbe exempt from paying Council Tax!\n4. Although there are problems with\nthe NUS, it is a hugely important organization for students. By being in the\nNUS, we can actually shape and improve the way the NUS functions.\n5. The NUS is the perfect way for\nstudents from across the country to\ncome together to discuss issues. We\ncan democratically elect delegates to\nrepresent our views on HE funding,\naccommodation for students, etc. at\nNational Conference and thus be part\nof a broader student movement.\n6. The NUS is a federation of individual student unions. Imperial College\nUnion can still have its own opinion;\nwe don\u2019t have to agree with the NUS\non everything.\n7. We get lots from the NUS to justify\nthe membership money \u2013 for example\nlegal support for our union, access to\nspecialist NUS staff and training for\nICU clubs and societies.\n8. There are lots of discounts that can\nonly be obtained with an NUS card (e.g\n\u00a32 off every BSM driving lesson and an\nAmazon discount!) The only reason\nthese discounts exist is that the NUS\nhas negotiated them.\n9. The NUS Extra card costs \u00a310 but\ncan save you a lot of money throughout\nthe year and can also be used abroad\n(also, \u00a34 of this goes directly back to\nICU!)\n10. Last year there was a record breaking turnout for the referendum when\nwe decided to affiliate to the NUS.\nMost people are just bored of this debate now! Vote to remain affiliated if\nyou don\u2019t think that our decision last\nyear should be overturned by a few\npeople on Council who are trying to\nfulfill personal agendas.\nCaroline Clark\nis voting Yes\nFriday 20 June 2008\nis voting No\nSteve Brown\nICU President\n1.\nNUS is too Expensive. As\nwell as the \u00a3 46,000 affiliation fee that ICU pays,\nthere are thousands of \u00a3s\nof hidden costs, e.g. conference delegate travel expenses (in-cluding national conference, liberation\nconferences and staff conferences).\n2. NUS is Financally Mismanaged. It\nspends more money than it has, regularly running up deficits one fifth of its\n\u00a33.5m budget and has been forced to\ndispose of capital assets to meet running costs. To combat this, NUS decided to introduce a stealth tax, the NUS\nExtra Card, from which \u00a36 of each sale\ngoes to the NUS budgetary drainpipe.\nIn any case very few NUS extra cards\nhave been sold at Imperial and the majority of student discounts are available\non production of your Imperial swipe\ncard.\n3. NUS is Unrecontructed. Most Unions went through a process of restructuring twenty years ago, but NUS\ndidn\u2019t. NUS remains the same ridiculous clunking vehicle that Jack Straw\nmade it in the 60\u2019s. The NUS Executive\nclaims to be \u201cpolitically diverse\u201d yet\ncontains the same number of revolutionary socialists than it does Liberal\nDemocrats and Conservatives com-bined. Is this really representative of\nUK students views?\n4. Opportunities for a better world. It\nwould only require a few more Unions\nto establish a viable alternative national union to NUS that would fulfil the\ngoals that NUS lays claim to and one\nthat is genuinely representative of student opinion.\n5. NUS reform failed. Imperial College\nUnion worked hard this year to change\nNUS and made it clear back in October\nthat if radical changes were not made\nthey we would reconsider our mem-bership. NUS have had their chance to\nchange and have blown it. This battle\nhas been lost \u2013 let\u2019s not take the gamble that somehow next year it will be\nOK and waste another \u00a346,000 in the\nprocess.\n6. The NUS spends more money taking decisions than it does implementing them. What do Imperial students\ngain from paying \u00a346,000 to fund a\ndebating club for sabbatical officers?\nThe majority of Imperial students\nwho have given up their time to attend\nNUS events to represent us have experienced the NUS shambles in person\nare now wanting ICU to leave as they\nhave witnessed what the NUS is like in\npractice.\n7. Imperial has one of the most active\nstudent bodies in the country. It would\nbe better to plough our \u00a346,000 in to\nwhat Imperial students are doing rather than continue handing it over to the\nwasteful NUS.\n8. By disaffiliating this would free up\nofficer time and financial resources to\nwork with other Unions on relevant issues when necessary. This was recently\ndemonstrated by our medical students\nwho cooperated with other students\nin London to campaign against the\nremoval of their right to free accom-modation. The NUS had nothing to\nsay on this issue because they are so\nhamstrung by their own internal politics that they don\u2019t have time to dedicate to these bread and butter student\nissues.\n9. Despite claiming otherwise, the\nNUS provides us with no professional\nsupport. If Imperial College Union\nneeds legal or financial advice we still\nhave to meet the full costs ourselves regardless of whether or not we are NUS\naffiliates.\n10. NUS\u2019s ultimate failure as a representative body is all too clear. They\nare dismissed by parliamentary committees as only being representatives\nof student activists and the government have recently taken steps to\ncircumvent NUS altogether in an\nattempt to determine what student\nopinion really is. Representation only\nworks if the NUS has legitimacy and\ncredibility with their members and\ndecision makers. It is clear that they\nenjoy neither.\n10 reasons to leave the NUS\n\n"

Tel: 020 7594 8072. Fax: 020 7594 8065.\nPrinted by The Harmsworth Printing Ltd, 17 Brest\nRoad, Derriford, Plymouth. Registered newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711. Copyright \u00a9 Felix 2008.\nLOLCAT OF TEH YEAR\nLOLCAT OF TEH YEAR\nStudent ethnicity: refusing\nto be racially counted\nFelix has uncovered College data that\nsuggests a massive disparity in the willingness of students to record their racial background between \u2018Home\u2019 (UK)\nstudents, and those from the EU and\noverseas.\nIn the 2006/2007 student statistics\nrecorded by College, in which students\nare asked to provide information about\ntheir ethnic background, a startling\n77% of both Overseas and EU student\nclassifications refused to give information about their ethnic identity, whereas only 1% of Home students declined\nto define their racial origins.\nFor example: whilst college reports\napproximately 982 undergraduate students with Chinese nationality, only\n76 undergraduates in the Overseas fee\ncategory described themselves as being of Chinese ethnicity. The two categories that appear to object most to\nthe ethnic self--classification appear\nto be Overseas students from the Far\nEast, and \u201cWhite\u201d EU students, both\nof whom are dramatically underrepresented in the data.\nThe reason for this difference between UK and foreign students is\nunclear. It is possibly caused by College\u2019s collection method, which is not\nconsistent for all categories (the data\nis recorded at different points of the\napplication process for foreign and\nUK students), potentially skewing the\ndata.\nHowever, student opinion voiced to\nFelix suggests other possible causes.\nMany students found it difficult to\nidentify with any of the categories, and\nothers found that more than one category applied to them. Whilst there are\nthree categories devoted to southern\nAsia (\u2018Bangladeshi,\u2019 \u2018Indian\u2019 and \u2018Pakistani\u2019), Far Eastern student are forced\nto pick between \u2018Chinese,\u2019 \u2018Other Asian\u2019\nand \u2018Other.\u2019\nAnother possible reason for the difference lies in attitudes to ethnicity and\nthe right of any organisation to enquire\nabout a person\u2019s race. Many people feel\nsuch information is private, and are\nunsure as to how it may be used by the\norganisation..\n\u201cEthnicity is a very sensitive issue,\u201d\nsaid one German student, \u201cmany\npeople from my country would feel\nuncomfortable when presented with\nsuch a question.\u201d This explanation was\nrepeated from several foreign students\nto account for the apparent difference\nbetween the Home and EU/Overseas\nrecorded data.\nThe data is collected in order to allow College to monitor the diversity of\nits student body, so that it can theoretically ensure fair access for all students\nregardless of race. If the ethics of being\nasked such questions is the cause of\nthe discrepancy, it poses the question\nover why UK students are more willing\nto submit information on their ethnic\nbackground to College.\nOne possible reason is the regularity with which UK students have been\nasked such questions over their life-time. In the UK, there are many processes and policies that are specifically\ndesigned to \u2018widen participation\u2019 for all\nethnicities, which have led to monitoring in the form of these questionnaire\nsections in many official documents issued by governmental bodies.\nUK students have been filling out\nsuch paperwork for most of their lives,\nand thus are used to being asked such\ninformation. This has possibly caused\na desensitisation to relatively intrusive\ndata collection, whereas students from\nnon-UK backgrounds are concerned\nabout the nature and purpose of such\nquestions.\nWhether these disparities show a\nUK population that is laudably unconcerned by questions over ethnicity, or\nhas simply become accustomed to in-trusiveinformation-gathering,remains\nto be seen. It is difficult to extrapolate\nto the other institutions across the\ncountry, but the difference between\nthe responses to the question of ethnicity for UK and non-UK students is\nunquestionable at IC.\nvon Hagens \u2013 ICSM\u2019s next\nHead of Anatomy?\nThe Imperial grapevine is alive and kicking with rumours that Dr.\nGunther von Hagens will be joining Imperial\u2019s School of Medicine\nas Head of Anatomy in the coming academic year. The infamous\nprofessor is widely known for his Bodyworlds exhibitions that have\nbecome an absolute phenomenon the world over. He is also the\npresenter of Channel 4\u2019s \u201cThe Anatomist\u201d in which he regularly\ndissected corpses on live TV. Whilst the rumours are unconfirmed\nit has independently made its way to the ears of more than three\nmembers of the Felix staff, lending it some genuine credibility\nFarewell!\nWe hope you enjoyed Felix this year. Good\nluck with your exam results and we\u2019ll be\nback before you can say \u201cfail/2:1/ZOMG\nfirst!\u201d Have a fantastic summer, whatever\nyou do or wherever you find yourself.\nThe Felix Team\nAndrew Somerville\nDeputy & News Editor\nA sample ethnicity questionnaire\nfrom UK central government\n\n"

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhis is the end/Beautiful\nfriend/This is the end/\nMy only friend, the end\u201d.\nAnd indeed it is: end of\ntoiling daily/weekly in\nthe library and also the end of Felix for\nthis academic year. I have thoroughly\nenjoyed trying to \u2018eruditise\u2019 the heavily scientific community here in South\nKensington, and also myself in the\nprocess. It is also the end of Tomo\u2019s\nstint as editor and a HUGE thanks goes\nto him for his patience and all his help,\nwithout which the Arts pages would\ncertainly not have not turned out as\nwell as they have.\nThe End. Jim Morrison was singing about a very different end: death.\nIt was something of which he thought\nconstantly: he saw it as the \u201cbig sleep\u201d,\nto which he looked forward to and\nyearned for after his years \u2018caining\u2019 it\nas lead singer of The Doors. The theme\nof ritual, artifice and mortality is also\nexplored at the Alexia Goethe Gallery,\nwhere artist Jodie Carey is currently\nexhibiting work. The small, stark, minimalist space on Dover Street is irritatingly easy to miss but showcases some\nrare and interesting talent. This exhibi-tion, Still, Life, examines death in comparison to life, with life portrayed as\nsomething ugly, reflected by the manner in which we ourselves deal with\ndeath. The artist says \u201cHoover dust\u2026\nIf you die tomorrow, all that would be\nleft of you would be in your Hoover\u201d.\nShe views funeral and memorials as a\nthing \u201clest we remember\u201d, the opposite\neffect to remembering someone.\nUpon entering the gallery, these messages are not apparent as we see sculptures made from roses, feathers and\nfurniture (an odd sounding combina-tion). Upon closer inspection the roses\nare made from blood-stained news-paper, covered in lard. (I really should\ntake note of the \u201cDo not touch\u201d sign).\nAs one ascends the stairs to the installation one is met with a completely surreal scene. Boxes and boxes of handcrafted bones (femurs, coccyx\u2019s, tail\nbones, portions of skulls) scatter the\nfloor and are stacked up amid strewed\nnewspaper. The ice-cold air conditioning reinforces the notion of death. Far\nfrom being sinister, I thought it utterly\namazing, thinking to the intense, even\nobsessive, effort that has to be put in\nto craft each and every element in the\ninstallation.\nA few streets away form the Alexia\nGoethe gallery is the White Cube gallery where Rosie Milton goes on an escapade to Hell and back as she reviews\nthe Jake and Dinos Chapman exhibi-tion. Be prepared for some disturbing\nimages, bizarre concepts.\nI have also selected a few of John\nBetjeman\u2019s poems and \u201cCulture\u201d\nCrawl/Tube map this week features\nsome alternative nights out.\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nFucking hell! Hippy Hitler?!\nThe Jake and Dinos Chapman Exhibiton, \u201cIf Hitler Had Been A Hippy How Happy\nWould We Be\u201d, at the White Cube gallery exhibits some gruesome but highly thought-provoking work. We sent Rosie Milton to Hell and Back to find out more\nT\nowards the end of May\nthis year the White Cube\ngallery unveiled the new\nwork of two of their most\nwell-known YBA\u2019s (Young\nBritish Artists), brothers Jake and\nDinos Chapman, the controversially\ntense \u2018spectacle\u2019: If Hitler Had Been\nA Hippy How Happy Would We Be. I\nhope to release it from its stigma of the\n\u2018shock effect\u2019 and instead reveal the wit\nand perspicacity in the minds of the\n\u2018terrible twosome\u2019 who are thankfully\nfar from being \u2018serious\u2019 in that contrived way that any artist who enters\ninto the realm of the controversial can\nborderline on becoming. The london-paper quoted the brothers, referring\nto their first \u2018Hell\u2019 installation from\n2000 (lost in a warehouse fire four\nyears ago) as being \u201c\u2026only art. We\nwill make it again\u201d. Heading the official\npress release for the current exhibition\nis a brief self-referencing ditty: \u2018HELL\nhath no fury/Like a chapman spurned/\nSo come see the second/ \u2018Cos the first\none burned\u2019. Enticed by this carniva-lesque introduction, one can easily\nsee that \u2018Fucking Hell\u2019, which features\nas a part of the whole exhibition at the\nWhite Cube, swallows up its predecessor with its references to modern media and profound (or profane, rather)\npast events. The exhibition comprises\nof three rooms: the upper floor gallery,\nwhose walls are lined with what appear\nto be at first aged portraits but on closer inspection reveal the bulging eyes,\ncracking skin and swollen veins of dead\nor \u2018undead\u2019 zombie-like sitters, yet\ndelicately painted in a style of realism\nwhich could more commonly be attributed to the hand of an old master. DeDetails of Sex\nDisasters of war\nGreat deeds against the dead\nGigantic fun\nThe Rape of Creativity\nscending into the depths of (Fucking)\nHell on the lower floor, you approach\nnine large glass cabinets \u2013 the view\nfrom the stairs allowing you to immediately see these cases as having been\nlaid out in the instantly recognisable\nicon of the swastika. In the final room\nare some twee and harmless-looking\nwatercolours. Only they become tainted instantly with the knowledge that\nthey are the Chapman brothers\u2019 interpretations of Hitler\u2019s own watercolour\npaintings (signed \u2018Hitler 2007\u2019 gives it\naway). Hitler\u2019s paintings have become\nsought-after today, but not for his\ncompetent hand \u2013 another irony the\nChapman brothers address through\nthis exhibition. Returning to \u2018Fucking\nHell\u2019, this installation recreates a narrative of Hell as seen in the minds of\nthe Chapman brothers \u2013 at the centre a\nmassive volcano belches out suspicious\nblack smoke \u2013 and petering down from\nthe deathly mountain\u2019s slopes the landscape spreads into four corners of hell,\nwhere lie a temple, factory, a mass\ngrave and the sea to nowhere. The\nChapman brothers execute this fantasy Hell with an attention to detail so\nminute and repetitive you find yourself\n\n"

Unfortunately I don\u2019t have\npersonal access to as many sabbs as\nthe NO campaigners, and considering\nthe perfect timing of this referendum,\nwe\u2019ve found most Imperial students\nare revising, making it a little difficult\ngetting volunteers.\nAnyway, back to the topic at hand:\ncommon NUS myths.\nMyth 1. Students\u2019 unions can\nwork together on common issues,\nthey don\u2019t need NUS\nWell actually that\u2019s not a myth, it is true!\nIndividual students\u2019 unions can and do\nwork effectively together on a lot of is-sues, but the vital question is whether\nthis is true for national issues such as\nnext year\u2019s HE review. Although there\nare problems with the NUS, it remains\na hugely important organisation for all\nstudents. By being in the NUS, we can\nactually shape and improve the way it\nfunctions. Just as NUS reformed its\nhigher education policy at this year\u2019s\nannual conference with the support of\nICU, it will seek to reform its governance structures in the next year with an\noverwhelming mandate established to\ndo so. Imperial must be there with the\nmajority of student officers to champion and deliver the change that is re-quired, for the benefit of all students.\nMyth 2. NUS is too different from\nImperial to be able to represent us\nNUS is very different to Imperial. 70%\nof the membership is made up of FE\nstudents, and delegates tend to come\nfrom an arts background. It has also\nbeen claimed that Imperial students are\nall Tories (though this has never been\nproved), in contrast to the lefty agenda\nof the NUS. But we are still all students!\nWe all want good qualifications and\nfacilities at an affordable price, and the\nmost effective way of achieving this is\nthrough a strong national body. By staying in NUS, we will continue to ensure\nthat national policies are in agreement\nwith ours, and build alliances with other unions. By doing so, we will ensure\nthat NUS is a balanced organisation to\nbe reckoned with. And even if there are\nany policies that we do not agree with,\nICU has the right not to enforce them,\njust as any other union does.\nMyth 3. NUS wants to give\nour money to sub-standard\nuniversities\nI finally read up on the National Bursary Scheme. Bursaries are non-repay-able grants given to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and they\u2019re\npaid for out of our top up fees. However last year, many universities failed\nto allocate this money (\u00a319,000,000\nin fact) because the current system is\noverly complicated and inaccessible.\nSurely a national, regulated bursary\nscheme would be a better solution?\nImperial allocates more than the usual\namount in bursaries, so there are fears a\nnational scheme would affect this. But\nshould we take such a short-sighted\nview? Scholarships for merit are unfair because they often benefit people\nwho had access to good schools, rather\nthan the most able. In addition a strong\neconomy needs a skilled workforce in a\nvariety of domains; if that means courses in golf-management, so be it, but at\nleast fund them properly so they are\nmore than just Mickey-mouse courses.\nMyth 4. The affiliation fee is a rip\noff\nICU receives an annual \u00a31.25m from\nImperial College. This figure does not\ninclude money from other sources,\nsuch as bars, shops and rented premis-es. I asked the sabbaticals about ICU\u2019s\nturnover but I am still awaiting for an\nanswer. According to John Collins, last\nyear\u2019s President, ICU spent \u00a315m over\nthe last two years, including more than\n\u00a33 million on the Beit Building alone.\nThis makes the comparatively modest NUS affiliation fee (approximately\n\u00a340,000) affordable in the context of\nthe multi-million pound expenditure\nof ICU. Students attending other universities do not have to choose between a well-resourced students\u2019 union and NUS affiliation, and there is no\nreason why we at ICU should be forced\nto either.\nMyth 5. The NUS is doomed\nWell, no. NUS is in a better financial\nstate than it has ever been. Last year\nit slashed its overdraft from \u00a31m to\n\u00a30.3m, and next year is on course to\nbreak even. Meanwhile, more than 65\nper cent of delegates at NUS national\nconference voted, in agreement and\nwith the crucial support of ICU\u2019s delegates to reform the democratic and\nparticipatory structures of the national\nunion. The majority of NUS delegates\nagree with ICU, and the coming year is\nvital to ensuring that those arguments\nfor reform are made a reality in the\nNUS structures.\nLast year there was a record breaking\nturnout for the referendum when ICU\ndecided to affiliate to NUS. We should\nnot let this be overturned on the whim\nof a few individuals on Council who\nare trying to fulfil personal agendas\nrather than represent the best interests of students. We should not allow\nthis vital year for NUS reform and the\nimpending Government reviewing of\nfees and funding to take place without\nICU\u2019s involvement.\nFive common NUS myths\nis voting No\nSteve Brown\nICU President\nW\nell you\u2019ve heard\nthe arguments and\nif you have not already voted now\nit is decision time.\nThe faults and failures of the NUS\nhave been well documented and now\nyou have to decide whether it is worth\nour while throwing good money after bad at an organisation that is still\nstuck in the 1970\u2019s. Imperial students\ndo not benefit from collectively paying \u00a346,000 to facilitate discussion\nand debate between ludicrously titled,\nPythonesque competing Marxist sects\nwhich leads to policy that is dismissed\nby everyone in the real world as unrepresentative and out of touch. This year\nICU has been calling for NUS reform\nand it hasn\u2019t been delivered. By voting No! you will free up more officer\ntime for the 2008/09 sabbaticals to focus their efforts on real student issues\nrather than getting bogged down in a\npointless debate about the NUS constitution with a bunch of extreme left\nbureaucrats. Does this sound interest-ing? I think not.\nThroughout the past few weeks it\nhas become apparent that the overwhelming majority of students who\nhave given up their time to help attempt to change the NUS have been\nactively campaigning for disaffiliation\nyet those who are now arguing that\nwe should stay in NUS have made no\neffort whatsoever to engage with the\norganisation this year. The one person\nwho has was elected as a delegate to\nannual conference and voted for keeping NUS the way that it is in the hope\nthat it would be better placed to cater\ntowards her extreme brand of activist politics. When you cast your vote\nI urge you to consider the majority\nopinion of your fellow students who\nhave given up their time this year to\nengage with NUS and not those who\nare putting forward an idealistic view\nof NUS which is based on rhetoric and\nnot on experience.\nFrom a personal perspective I have\nnothing to gain or lose from the result\nof this vote. I am leaving the College in\nJuly and will not be a full member of\nthe Union next year. I am arguing so\nstrongly for us to disaffiliate from the\nNUS now as I believe that in its current form it represents an ineffective\nuse of money and that students who\nare here next year can do something\nmore worthwhile with it. This is not\na debate about whether or not we can\nafford the affiliation fee \u2013 we can and\nit is in our budget for next year. What\nI am trying to get across is that there\nare far more productive, effective and\ninteresting ways that students at Imperial can utilise that \u00a346,000 rather than\ngive it to an organisation that serves no\nother purpose than to act is a jumped\nup debating club for UK sabbatical\nofficers.\nIn 2006 the NUS was able to tempt\nyou with the possibility of discounts\nat HMV and TopShop which are now\nno longer advertised on the NUS Extra website. More and more companies\nare starting to realise that the NUS Extra discount card is not the best way\nto target the student market. If you\nowned a chain of shops why would you\nwant an organisation that has no direct\ncontact with students to restrict your\nmarket to those students who want\nto pay \u00a310 for a card in order to make\nthemselves money? It dose not make\nsense for businesses and most importantly it does not make sense for the\noverwhelming majority of UK students\nwho are now faced with their so-called\nrepresentative voice attempting to restrict their access to student discounts\nin a desperate attempt to plug the hole\nin their accounts.\nIf NUS activists have nothing better\nto do than march about the streets of\nLondon waving placards and selling\neach other copies of the Morning Star\nthen that is their prerogative but it does\nnot follow that this is an activity that\nwe should aspire to subsidise. Imperial\nstudents don\u2019t benefit from so-called\nrepresentation where the discussion at\ntimes can feel as if the NUS is debating\nabout whether the revolution should\ncome on Thursday or whether it would\nbe better to wait until the new full\nmoon! Things have moved on since the\n1970\u2019s and it is a shame that the NUS\nhasn\u2019t caught up. In light of NUS\u2019 faults\nthe only rational choice to be made is\nto vote No! in the referendum. NUS is\nfar too broken to fix and despite our\nbest efforts this year it is not really\nworth having another go.\nDon\u2019t vote for the NUS reform roulette!\n\u201cShould Imperial College Union remain affilated to the National\nUnion of Students?\u201d\nVoting is open now!\nHead to imperialcollegeunion.org/vote to cast your vote\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFriday 20 June 2008 felix\nScience\nPremium Bonds, a post-war savings\nmechanism launched by Harold Macmillan in 1956, owed much of their\npopularity to a monthly draw, which\nwon some lucky bond owners cash\nprizes \u2013 up to a hefty \u00a31000. At the\nheart of these draws lay ERNIE 1, a\nrandom number generator used to select the winning bonds. ERNIE was at\nthe cutting edge of technology at the\ntime; on its own this would probably\nhave earned it a place on permanent\ndisplay at the Science Museum. But, as\nI discovered when I went along there to\nspeak to Tilly Blyth, Curator of Computing, that's only part of the reason\nERNIE's won this accolade...\nSo what is a random number\ngenerator?\nIt\u2019s a machine that generates random\nnumbers! There are different kinds of\nrandom numbers \u2013 there are pseudorandom numbers and there are true\nrandom numbers \u2013 a true random\nnumber generator uses a real, physical\nevent to generate the random numbers \u2013 it\u2019s not using software, so it can\u2019t\nbe programmed or interfered with.\nERNIE 1 used the movement of electrons in a gas diode to create the random numbers.\nTell me more\u2026\nWell, ERNIE 1 didn\u2019t use just one random number generator to create a random number \u2013 it actually used two,\nusing one to generate another, creating\na \u201cdoubly random number\u201d, if such a\nthing exists! This was just in case one\nof the diodes wasn\u2019t truly random \u2013\nthis way, there was a backup.\nSo, today\u2019s computers use pseu-do-random number generators\u2026\nNot necessarily \u2013 not all machines do\n\u2013 there are microprocessors that exist\ntoday that have a true random number\ngenerator within them \u2013 one of the\nthings we\u2019re showing in the display is a\nVIA C7 processor which has a random\nnumber generator within the hardware\nof the chip. Again, that\u2019s using variations of the electrons across the chip\nto generate the random numbers\u2013 a\nphysical process, not software.\nYou mentioned earlier there were\nsome precursors to ERNIE\u2026\nYes, GCHQ developed something\ncalled the \u201cDonald Ducks\u201d \u2013 random\nnumber generators which were used\nfor cryptography, but we don\u2019t know\nmuch about them \u2013 there are a couple of early computer people who do\nknow a little bit, but there\u2019s not a lot of\ninformation.\nBecause we\u2019ve lost the technicians over time, or because it\u2019s\nsecret?\nI think because it was GCHQ, it was\nfairly secret at the time \u2013 a lot of that\ninformation\u2019s now been released into\nthe National Archives, but nobody\u2019s\nreally done that much research into it.\nI see National Savings and Insurance (NS&I) have a new ERNIE\nnow \u2013 ERNIE 4. Does it still use a\nphysical random number generator to choose the winning bonds?\nYes, it\u2019s absolutely crucial that it\u2019s still\na physical random number generator\n\u2013 they couldn\u2019t use a pseudo-random\nnumber generator because it could\nbe influenced by an individual: if it\u2019s\nprogrammable then somebody who\nknows how to how to manipulate\nthat program could. It\u2019s absolutely at\nthe heart of what premium bonds are\nabout to make sure that they can\u2019t be\ntampered with. So yes, ERNIE 4 uses\nphysical processes to generate its random numbers. It\u2019s not neon gas diodes,\nERNIE 1: Nice little earner, one careful owner\nThe NS&I's much-loved physical random number generator will soon be on display at the Science Museum\n1. 'Supermac' Macmillan, promoting the premium savings bonds 2. ERNIE, an\nunhackable random number generator, was used to choose winning bonds 3. It\nduly became an integral part of the advertising strategy for these popular bonds\nWhat a year \u2013 from the gruesome minutiae of Inca sacrifices to the unexpected correlation between strippers' ovulation cycles and their tips; from the unpublicised dangers of St. John's\nWort to DNA strands hunting each other down electrostatically \u2013 to my mind, the science pages have covered an astonishing breadth of topics. None of this would be possible without\nthe sterling work from so many contributors: you know who you are. Nor could it be done without the copy editors, who play an all-too-often unacknowledged, but crucial role. Or indeed the rest of the Felix crew: I dread to think what the basement would be like without you all. Foremost, however, thanks to Tomo, for expert guidance, and deep reserves of patience,\nand humour, in the face of a weekly barrage of brainless InDesign questions. And for running one of the best Felices I've seen \u2013 it's been great to have been part of it.\nHave a great summer everyone! Edmund\nEdmund Henley\nScience Editor\nlike ERNIE 1, though \u2013 it uses a silicon-based chip from Intel.\nOne of the press release pho-tos, showing ERNIE 1\u2019s launch,\nshowed a certain Ernest Marples.\nDid the ERNIE acronym come\nfrom him?\nI don\u2019t think so \u2013 none of the original engineers can remember how the\nERNIE name came about. But I don\u2019t\nthink it came from Marples \u2013 he was\nPostmaster General, and was there at\nthe launch, but not whilst ERNIE was\nbeing developed. But he later became\nthe minister for transport in fact \u2013\nhe\u2019s the person who gave us parking\nmeters. So he gave us two wonderful\nthings \u2013 premium bonds and parking\nmeters. I think it turned out that premium bonds were much more popular\nthough!\nErnie seemed to have been very\npopular at the time \u2013 \u201che\u201d was on\nsome of the premium bond ad-verts. Was that the intention \u2013 to\nput this machine which couldn\u2019t\nbe tampered with at the heart of\nthe campaign?\nI think so, if you go back to the way\npeople were thinking in the 1950s, this\nwas a really innovative machine. You\nhave the very early computers, like Colossus, but nobody\u2019s heard of Colossus,\nthe LEO 1 computer, the first computer to be used in a commercial environ-ment. It was really early days for the\nBritish computing industry \u2013 we really\nwere front-runners at this point: we\ncreated the first programmed computer \u2013 the \u201cManchester baby\u201d as it was\nthen known; and the EDSAC computer\nat Cambridge \u2013 we really were at the\ncutting edge of this technology. But\nthis was the first time that a government department was relying on an\nelectronic machine. So it becomes very\nimportant for people to back that, believe in it: you need to have the public\ntrust in the ability of these \u201celectronic\nbrains\u201d, as they then called them, to do\nsomething like this, that\u2019s truly ran-dom. So I think part of it was about\nmarketing ERNIE in the right way,\nand making sure that people felt positively about the machine, and about\nthe scheme in general. Because there\nwas some concern whether the bonds\nscheme was a good idea, whether the\nit was demoralising \u2013 turning us into a\nnation of gamblers. It seems odd today,\nwhen we\u2019ve got the National Lottery,\nbut at that time it was really seen to be\nmoral decline! Now it\u2019s about super-casinos, but then it was whether we\ncould even have a bond scheme, run by\nthe government , where you could get\nyour stake back at any time \u2013 it\u2019s not\nthe same as betting on the horses, or\non the lottery.\nI see that ERNIE used a combination of valves, transistors and\nprinted circuits. Were there many\nother computers which existed at\nthis interface between valve and\ntransistor technology, using both?\nThere were a few, there\u2019s the Pegasus\ncomputer that you can see on display\nnext to ERNIE \u2013 that used both. They\nwere both buit at the time when there\nwas a shift over from valves \u2013 transistors were a lot faster, so there was a\nclear benefit to using them. Pegasus\nis interesting, as it was used to check\nwhether ERNIE was truly random\n\u2013 mathematicians were called in to\ncheck ERNIE\u2019s output, using Pegasus\nto do the statistical analysis. So it\u2019s nice\nthat we\u2019ve got Pegasus on display next\nto Ernie \u2013 they\u2019re both machines from\n1956-57, looking at the period when\nthe technology changed.\nGiven how difficult it is to get\nvalves these days, does ERNIE\nstill work?\nIt doesn\u2019t, no \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t like to plug\nit in! Mainly because of the wiring \u2013\nwhen ERNIE was given to us by the\nNS&I wires had to be cut to take it into\nsections and it would be a big job to rewire it. We did look at if we could get\nERNIE working again on gallery, but\nwe saw that realistically it would take\nat least three years of work. I\u2019d still like\nto get ERNIE working, but it raises all\nsorts of questions about the nature of\nmuseums \u2013 especially with computing\ntechnology. Should we show objects\nas they were originally, or we should\nreplace components, and put in new\nparts, not the originals, to show them\nworking?\nYou want a historical object\u2026\nYes, you do, so that people can do re-search. Questions might be asked in\n200 years as to what were the transistors like in 1953. If they were based\non the modern day counterparts you\ncouldn\u2019t do that work.\nAnd what was the cultural impact\nof ERNIE and the other \u201celectronic brains\u201d. Can you track it down?\nWell, if you look at computers in cultural terms, their impact is huge. If\nyou think about films, like Bladerunner, or Terminator, they reflect how\nwe felt about computers at the time. In\nmany ways ERNIE is a cultural signature of its time \u2013 ERNIE 1 was a very\ngrey, solid state machine. By the time\nERNIE 2 was launched 16 years later, it\nwas purple and gold, with lace curtains\ncovering the tape reels \u2013 it was based\non the Goldfinger/James Bond films,\nand represented a completely different\nway of looking at technology and our\nfuture. And by the time you get to 16\nyears after that you\u2019re seeing a machine\nwhich has more of a Saturday Night\ngame-show feel. It\u2019s nice to look at\nERNIE as a cultural signature as much\nas a technological innovation!\nERNIE 1 will be on display at the\nScience Museum from 26th June\n\n"

    "content": "24 felix Friday 20 June 2008\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nThe Great Culture Crawl\nNotting Hill Arts Club\nPretty much situated at the top of the stairs coming out of the underground, the NHAC is where all the trendy kids\ngo. With everyone saying \u201csick\u201d a lot, their unique hairstyles and eclectic fashion, it is easy to feel like an average,\ngarden-variety Londoner - even if you are the Felix Arts Supremo (look, I was having a wardrobe crisis, ok!) The\nclub\u2019s colourful interior design and art-covered walls definitely reflect the artsy crowd who frequent this small\nhangout. Don\u2019t let that fact perturb you: the club has a great atmosphere with everyone there for the random mix\nof music genres on show each night of the week. The club puts on a variety of both acoustic and electronic music,\noften fusing the two, which gives a unique sound quite different from a lot of other generic bars. The club is ideal\nfor those not into \u201chorrible druggy electro music\u201d (each to their own). This Friday, Gaz Mayal and Ellie, whoever\nthey may be, are treating the NHAC to a mix of calypso, reggae and good old fashioned Rock \u2018n Roll. On Saturday\nget ready for twee-pop-psych-rock-folk: I think there it is a case of see-it-to-believe-it. The cocktails are also delicious here and there is plenty of fruit on the bar to steal and eat.\nTorture Garden at Mass\nMass, the home of Torture Garden, is an ex-church (highly ironic given the extent of the\ndebauchery which ensues most nights of the week) that stands alone in a small square. Spread\nover five floors, connected by a wide spiraling staircase, it can be confusing on your first visit\nbut each floor opens out onto a spacious room. The layout is ideal for the monthly Torture\nGarden events which are certainly not just your average fetish night and offer plenty to see and\ntake part in. Before you run away in disgust/fear, TG is more about the dressing up, extremely\nfriendly vibe and dancing rather than the \u201cplay\u201d and sado-masochism (although there is of that\nplenty if you so wish). Dress code is strict, although one is allowed to take one\u2019s costume in\na bag and change inside to avoid embarrassment and odd glances on the tube. And by \u2018dress\ncode\u2019 they mean pretty much anything other than \u2018normal\u2019 attire. Not everyone in attendance\nsports crotchless leather trousers, pierced genitalia or gimp masks. It truly adds so much to\nthis crazy atmosphere to see people dressed in everything from sailor suits, to rubber Nazi\nuniforms (yes, a bit strange), aliens, Burlesque\u2026 As always there is the occasional sleazy/\noddball but the majority are several orders friendlier than the people you find in most clubs.\nThe music range covers everything from \u2018booty slut-core\u2019 to drum n bass, electro, rock, swing,\njazz, atmospheric, breaks and soundtrack. At around 25GBP for tickets, it is probably not an event\nyou will go to regularly but it is worth every penny for its novelty and 10pm-6am opening hours.\nThe Dublin Castle\nUp the road from Camden Town tube, the red light-lit (both outside and in) Dublin Castle is \u201cindie heaven\u201d for\naspiring young bands wishing to join the hordes of other musicians which make up the \u2018one album wonder\u2019 club.\nOK, that\u2019s slightly unfair and cynical, for the Dublin Castle is a great venue for fans of rock, indie and live music.\nThe back room of this pub is where the musical magic is created and all atop a very small stage. If, like me, you are\nnot so much a fan of the rough and tumble of larger rock gigs, then this is a great chance to enjoy indie/rock in a\nslightly safer, less sweaty environment. I say less sweaty as there is still a healthy quota of sweat to be had! But this\nis Camden, man, if you wanted clean and cultured you would have stayed in that SW bubble. This Friday Fox Gang\n(troubadouring humorist/satirist), the Onlookers (psychedelia with an RnB vibe), Muswell (heavy, nasty shouty shit\nbut still rather good) and Art of Marshall (indie pop - meh) shall be providing entertainment. The floor in the front\nbar gets VERY messy so if you have not mastered walking in heels like Arts Supremo then beware lest you slide\nseveral metres landing on your ass. Luckily, I was exiting the pub when this happened. Clientele here are the usual\nCamden crowd, with a few indie \u2018celebrities\u2019 pottering about, too. The back room is where the music takes place but\nthe front room has music making means of its own in the form of a jukebox. However, this really is a gig venue; if\nyou are not into your indie music then this probably is not for you. If it\u2019s a quiet drink you\u2019re after then head down to\nsome of the bars in the Lock area. Or get pissed at home.\nChapter Fourteen \u2013 Novel nights out\n\n"

With two newly\nfounded teams entered in different\nsections of the tournament our spirits were high and we were all looking\nforward to a fun weekend. With many\nof us seeing the end of exams during\nthe week things looked good despite\na couple slight navigational mishaps,\nparticularly when outdated iPhone\ntechnology lead us astray down dark\nand winding back lanes.\nFriday came with an excitable air\nwhich perhaps contributed to one\nfluffy haired physicist\u2019s \u2018baptism of fire\u2019\nwhen he attempted to blow out a minor\npan fire which, as one observer com-mented, \u201cwent woof!\u201d leaving him with\nslightly shorter eyelashes. Our nerves\nbegan to build as we watched the initial chukkas (matches) and both teams\u2019\nfirst games didn\u2019t really go to plan.\nThe first games didn\u2019t have many\nhighlights, but a couple of moments\nstood out. 1st\u2019s captain Jon Matthews\ngot sandwiched between two Reading\nplayers causing his already fractured\nwrist to get crushed and his subsequent cry of pain and appeal led to\na harsh technical ruling against him\nmuch to the dismay of fellow players\nSuzie Coats and Trish Haylock-Vize.\nIn the 2nd team match captain Monya\nZard, Emma Banks and Alex Savell\nplayed a frustrating match where the\nbest moment was one players bout of\n\u2018severe spatial awareness impairment\u2019\nwhen they briefly forgot which way we\nwere shooting. Despite this, we were\nall ready to attack our second games\nwith a great deal more experience of\nthe outdoor game.\nThe afternoon\u2019s ponies turned out\nto be a more spirited bunch than the\nmorning, particularly Jon\u2019s, which took\nsomething of a dislike to him with Jon\nlooking ever less secure in his saddle.\nThe 1st\u2019s looked much stronger despite\nthis and in a grudge match against ULU\nwe achieved a respectable 1-0 result,\nunfortunately in ULU\u2019s favour. Some\nstrange event known as the \u201cRSM Final\nFinale\u201d having drawn our Geologists\naway and the 1st\u2019s matches being over,\nSuzie was tasked to fill in Emma\u2019s slot\nin the 2nd\u2019s. Our most capable rider\ntook her favourite horse\u2026 Jon\u2019s. Fortunately, the gelding was more amenable\nto a female rider and Monya slowly\nbrought Canario back down from his\nfrenzied state. The 2nd\u2019s, like the 1st\u2019s\nlooked much stronger in the second\nmatch, but unfortunately conceded\ntwo early goals before taking control of\nthe chukka.\nWith one day down we were up for\na good night and had a great evening\nhanging out with the Brummie teams\nfor drinks and general banter. One\nplayer had a rather more eventful\nnight, meeting a cluster of four \u2018inexpertly parked\u2019 vehicles at high speed.\nTrish escaped the pile-up unscathed,\nunlike her newly repaired Micra, but\nbarely slept before the morning.\nSaturday saw a host of new teams and\na few replacements for the IC sides:\na full change of the 2nd\u2019s as Carlotta\nRidolfi, Ellie Hughes and Taz Zimmerman replaced three slightly sore\nteam members and Nick Jahn emerged\nfrom the depths of Chem Eng revision\nto sub in for Suzie on the 1st\u2019s, giving\nthem their most aggressive combination for the second day. After watching\na few games, the 2nd\u2019s headed off for\ntheir chukka against Birmingham. Despite losing the match, all three came\noff the pitch grinning from ear to ear\nhaving thoroughly enjoyed the new\nexperience.\nThe 1st\u2019s\u2019 two remaining chukka\u2019s\nwere our best chances for wins and the\naggressive line-up did not disappoint\nwith Jon Matthews putting them 1-nil\nup against St. Andrew\u2019s and they followed this up with an impressive 2-nil\nvictory in their final and fastest chukka\ndismounting with a new swagger in\ntheir steps (especially Jon with his goal\ntally now at three). In true Imperial\nstyle, half our teams were then drawn\naway by revision, but this did leave us\nwith the most experienced set of 2nd\u2019s\navailable and they were raring for their\nlast chukka. Of course, knowing when\nit was would\u2019ve helped.\nWith chukka\u2019s running late and\nthreats of teams being \u201cpenalised and\nwhipped\u201d by the organiser, Mike Hobday, we eventually figured it out, a typo\nmeant we weren\u2019t on the list and there\nwere no longer horses available so our\nchukka had to be pushed back until\nthe morning; after the eventful official\nplayers party.\nThough Imperial kept their idiocies\nto a minimum, the same could not be\nsaid for all. Mike, whose escapades\nmanage to do in one night what the entire Rugby team might take the whole\nof Fresher\u2019s week to accomplish, was\nfound vomiting in the Portaloos and we\nlater discovered that the middle aged\nman had similarly frequented a large\nnumber of bushes; just reward for pulling one of the girls on the dance floor...\nwhile attired in a floral dress. Also on\nthe honours list were the players that\nused their Fiesta to \u201cplace a gate where\nit was not wanted\u201d, crashing through a\nfence at 40 mph.\nThe final day started furiously with\nfast play leading to a few falls and one\nvisit by the air ambulance. The 2nd\u2019s\ntook to the pitch with adrenaline\npumping and determined to come back\nwith a strong result. A free hit gave us\nour first real chance and Monya took\nit forwards allowing Suzie to make it\n1-0. A good break quickly put us heading towards our opponent\u2019s goal again\nwith Monya\u2019s pass allowing Alex to\nscore sealing the victory.\nKnackered and sunburnt we spent\nthe afternoon supporting the other\nteams including a victorious \u2018Bath Spa\u2019\nteam captained by our own Jon Matthews after Bath Spa themselves failed\nto turn up. In the end a very tired set\nof players slumped into their seats on\nthe bus to talk of plans for the winter\ntournament next year all of us knowing that we want to come home with a\ntrophy (for Imperial next time!).\nPolo\u2019s summer outing up the M40\nAlex Savell reports as Imperial\u2019s Riding and Polo Club get stuck in at the University Polo Nationals\nThe 2nd\u2019s Carlotta Ridolfi turns her opposite number\nOne of the St. Andrew\u2019s girls feels the pressure in a ride-off from the 1st\u2019s\nThe 1st team\u2019s Trish Haylock-Vize in full swing\nROSIE\nSMITHELLS\n\n"

He promises that\nthis will be the last you will hear of it as he shares a few previously unmentioned \u2018essential\u2019 experiences\nO\nver the past academic\nyear I have written extensively about the two\nmonths I spent visiting\nEast Africa last sum-mer. It was a remarkable adventure that\nI wouldn\u2019t exchange for anything else\nin the world, and I hope that those of\nyou who have had the time to read my\npieces gained some insight into what\nmy experience was like. I also hope that\nit has provided some impetus for your\nown travel plans and displayed the importance of travel in the broadening of\nhorizons, as a necessary part of what I\nlike to call \u2018real education\u2019. Through\nmy previous articles I have attempted\nto thoroughly elucidate the bits of my\njourney I thought would most interest\nstudent readers, but now I am presenting a few gems that could not fit into\nthe themes of those articles. So, dear\nreaders, I hope you enjoy this special\nend-of-year-edition of \u2018essential experiences\u2018 as a parting goodbye!\nEssential Experience 1 \u2013 Climbing\nMount Kilimanjaro\nAt nearly 6000 metres high, Mount\nKilimanjaro in Tanzania, or \u2018Kili\u2019 as it\nis often known, is the tallest mountain\nin Africa and its summit is the highest point in Africa. It is also one of the\nlargest volcanoes on Earth and is the\nworld\u2019s tallest free-standing moun-tain. Although scaling it sounded like a\ndaunting task at first, I felt more at ease\nwhen I considered that it requires no\ntechnical expertise or equipment and\nthat it is summitted by many people\non a daily basis. Trips can be booked\non arrival and they cost about 500 US\ndollars per person. Climbing Kili was\nthe final highlight in Africa for me,\nand I arrived in Arusha beguiled at the\nsight of a mountain overshadowing\nthis small but active town. Waking up\nthe next day, I booked my trip and paid\nmy fee in cash before looking up once\nagain to notice what appeared to be a\npermanent cloud in the sky beyond the\nmountain I had been observing.\nI gradually realised that in fact THAT\nwas Kili and the mountain by Arusha\nwas the relatively smaller Mount Meru!\nThe trek to the top suddenly seemed\ndaunting once again. The most popular\nroute to the top is the Marangu route,\nwhich takes climbers up one face of\nthe mountain and back in 5 days with\naccommodation in purpose-built huts\nalong the way. This congested route appeals the most to your average \u2018tick the\nbox\u2019 tourist and offers a higher level of\ncomfort but, if being herded like cattle\nisn\u2019t your thing, the 6-day return Machame route can be undertaken. This\nis the most interesting and scenic route\nup the mountain, and takes the clients\nin a circle around Kili as they ascend\nthrough gorgeous valleys and jungles.\nThis route only has accommodation in\ntents and was the route I chose.\nThe climb itself was not tough in the\nbeginning. Constant rain and dense\nfog complicated things, while the terrain was thick jungle at first, becoming\nsparse tundra-like growth and then\nfinally a craggy, rocky landscape with\ncacti. The temperature was steadily\ndropping as we went higher but the\nstop-overs were at campsites that were\nsurprisingly well-equipped.\nI was being accompanied by one\n34 felix Friday 20 June 2008\nMy Kilimanjaro expedition team \u2013 one guide, two porters and I\nguide and two porters who carried all\nour luggage and equipment. It is a necessity for anyone climbing Kili to have\nat least this many paid \u2018employees\u2019 and\nwhen considering a Kili expedition, the\nwell-being of these \u2018employees\u2019 is one\nof the most important ethical considerations to make, in addition to the\nenvironmental degradation that you as\none of the hundreds upon hundreds of\ntourists will cause.\nThe dilemma is that the porters and\nguides tend to try and save on spending by using old and inappropriate\nequipment. Even though it is considered to be an easier climb than other\nmountains, repeatedly doing Kili is\na physically demanding task and improper preparation can be severely\ndetrimental to the guides\u2019 and porters\u2019\nhealth. It is a responsible tourist\u2019s duty\nto make sure that their team uses adequate equipment, even if it means that\nthey fork out for both theirs and their\nescort\u2019s equipment hire. Sadly though,\nMeal for one. Believe me, this was not appetising\nThe shadow of Kili on Mount Meru at sunrise\nAbove the clouds\nProof that I reached the top!\nThe register at base camp\nmany tourists inadvertently overlook\nthis and I saw naive tourists even agree\nto luxury expeditions where porters\nwere made to carry useless items such\nas tables and chairs all the way to the\nsummit, on top of everything else. A lot\nof this can be reduced by booking with\na reputable company, and this will also\nguarantee a better quality expedition.\nUnfortunately, despite the above,\ncaution is still needed when dealing\nwith these guides and porters, as they\nare known for being very aggressive\nwith regards to tipping. In my case,\nthe very porters that I had taken great\ncare in being nice to were the ones who\nganged up on me close to the end of\nthe expedition to try and bully outra-The arduous jurney to the top through valleys and jungles\n\n"

This time, they invited\nformer Malaysian Prime Minister\nDr. Mahathir Mohamad to deliver\nhis first public lecture in the UK to\nan audience at Imperial. The topic\nwas the war in Iraq and the initiative to criminalise war but due to\nsome previously controversial comments by the speaker, a complaint\nwas raised to the Union against him\nbeing allowed to deliver a lecture at\nImperial.\nIn response, College stopped short\nof cancelling the event altogether\ndue to legal issues, but instead limited the audience to members of\nImperial College only while also\nbanning all recording and photog-raphy. The PPS was forced to announce this decision with less than\n24 hours before the event and thus\nthe organisers once again received\nangry emails from members of the\npublic and students of other institutions who had paid for and made\narrangements to come to Imperial.\nFurther still, College even restricted\nentry to VIPs such as MPs and leaders of NGOs who turned up hoping\nto hear the ex-PM speak.\nMany students were angered at the\nlogic behind such drastic decision\nmaking and crowds were left waiting outside SAF on the day of the\nlecture as College security enforced\nthe restrictions. International media\nwas also present reporting on the\nproceedings.\nThe event was nonetheless well\nattended and a great success, with\nCollege\u2019s attempts at security unable\nto prevent photography and a secret\nrecording being made available on\nstudent news website Live!\nPPS 2: The Sequel \u2013 Mahatir Has Landed\n4\nmonths after their alleged mis-demeanours in the Union, Imperial College Football Club were\ninvolved in further incidents at the\nRembrandt Hotel and Motspur Park.\nAt the Motspur Park football\nground, the club was accused of being involved in fighting with rival\nfans that led to seats being ripped\nfrom the stands. At the Rembrandt\nHotel, ICFC was accused, amongst\nother things, of being abusive towards staff and smashing paintings.\nA wider dispute regarding Felix\u2019s\nreporting on the football club developed too over the course of the year,\nwith several ICFC members perceiving a bias within Felix.\nThis dispute was deepened by a\ntongue-in-cheek comment piece\nlampooningfootballersbutultimate-ly an article by Football Club Captain\nGaro Torossian and an editorial by\nFelix, laid the debate to rest.\nFootball Club loses deposit\nD\nebate was sparked about\nthe place of cannabis in society after the government\ndeclared that it would ignore the\nrecommendations of its own experts\nand raise the classification of the\ndrug from C to B.\nFelix interviewed drug health expert Professor David Nutt, a member of the Advisory Council on the\nMisuse of Drugs, the body that made\nrecommendations on cannabis to the\ngovernment, who said the substance\nshould remain class C.\nTo coincide with the interview,\nCannabis and Imperial\nT\nhere\u2019s still time to vote in\nthe NUS referendum if you\nhaven\u2019t already, which was\nsprung upon unsuspecting Imperial students by Union Council back\nin May (imperialcollegeunion.org/\nvote).\nAfter NUS Conference 2008, in\nwhich dramatic governance reforms\nwere rejected by only 25 votes, Imperial\u2019s delegates were left distinctly\nunimpressed, with many speaking of\ndisaffiliation. An attempt was made\nto force the referendum by getting\n600 student signatures but it became\nclear that it would take too long and\nso it fell to Council, which voted\noverwhelmingly in favour of the\nreferendum. Live!, Felix and stoic\ntv held a debate on NUS affiliation\nwhich included Kings College Union\nPresident Chris Mullins and NUS\nPresident Wes Streeting.\nThe referendum is currently ongoing as this reporter types. The greatest challenge for the referendum\u2019s\nproposers is raising awareness sufficiently so that enough votes are cast\nin order for quorum to be reached.\nIn non-hackery terms, this means\nthat 1800 votes are required for the\nreferendum to be legitimate. By the\ntime some of you late comers read\nthis, IC could no longer be a member of the NUS. Once again.\nAnother NUS referendum...\nSummer term: April \u2013 June\nS\nir Richard Sykes, the thirteenth\nRector of Imperial will be leaving in July after what was an almost eight year tenure at the College.\nDuring his time at the College,\nchange has been continuous to say\nthe least. Debates on whether or not\nthis change has benefited the College\nabound, but one thing is certain, the\ndifference is palpable and much of the\nCollege is inherently different compared to the years before his tenure.\nDuring his seven and a half years\nas Rector, Sykes increased the overseas student population to about\n30% of the entire student body,\nwhilst increasing international tuition fees by what some consider to\nbe an extortionate amount. He also\ncontroversially rebranded the College\u2019s identity, improving IC\u2019s global\nrecognition, and increased Imperial\u2019s standing to 5th place in the\nTHES World League Table.\nHis successor, Sir Roy Anderson,\nwill take over in July.\nSir Richard\u2019s era ends\nImperial\u2019s mental health\nAnd in\nother\nnews...\nThe Royal School of Mines\nattracted national media\nattention to the College with\na statement on its website\nlabelling Camborne School\nof Mines students \u201cCornish\ninbreds\u201d\nThe credibility of the National\nStudent Survey was brought\ninto question after a recording\nemerged on Live! in which a\nKingston lecturer was heard\ntelling students to falsify their\nanswers\nImperial was found to make the\nleast amount of money from\nlibrary fines compared to 20\nother top UK universities\nFelix surveyed Imperial students\nto hear their views on cannabis.\n143 students were surveyed with 1\nin 5 admitting to smoking cannabis regularly and a small majority\nof 54% were against legalisation of\ncannabis.\nIgnorance reared its ugly head on\nthe day too however, with 64% of\nstudents surveyed unaware that the\nclassification was being changed.\nOne attentive Imperial student even\nasked: \u201cDoes this mean we can\u2019t\nsmoke cannabis outside anymore?\u201d\nGolf clap, everyone...\nI\nn June, Felix delved deep into\nstatistics concerning the mental\nhealth and well-being of students\nat Imperial and also at institutions\nacross the country.\nOver the last year, the number\nof students searching for help with\nproblems like depression, stress and\nrelationships has increased by over\n10% \u2013 double the average growth of\nother UK student bodies.\nWhilst it was found that students\nat Imperial College use the Student\nCounselling Services (SCS) 44% less\nthan the national average, it still\nrecords 29% more cases of academic\nstress than the rest of the UK as a\nwhole.\nFelix\u2019s investigation also found\nthat despite undergraduate students\ncomprising 64% of the student body,\nthey only make up 55% of the users\nof the SCS; a low number compared\nto PhD postgrads who make up 19%\nof the university but 25% of the total\nSCS users.\nWritten by Tom Roberts, Kadhim Shubber,\nDaniel Wan, Afonso Campos & Ammar Waraich\n\n"

This year, his extra\nexperience has helped him clean up the medals\non many occasions. An epic performance at the\nBUSA regatta bagged him two golds, two silvers\nand one bronze, and he also won the Fullers sponsored Four Heads of River amongst other com-petitions. His prominence on the international\nscene looks set to grow and grow.\n\n"

The articles were deemed to be\nin violation of the Staff Student Protocol (SSP) and Election regulations.\nIn response Felix printed a \u2018no news\u2019\nstyle front cover and news section,\nexplaining the situation and declaring \u201cthe cat is not free\u201d.\nSince then efforts have been made\nin order to change and clarify the\nSSP and election regulation. Proposals made to council by Felix Editor,\nTom Roberts, and Live! Editor, Ashley Brown, have had mixed results.\nElection regulations remain as they\nwere, however, Council accepted\nchanges to the SSP, which are being\nreviewed by the Trustee Board before finally going for approval with\nthe College. If the Trustee Board\naccepts the changes, it doesn\u2019t end\nthere however, since College must\nalso approve the correction. The\ncase continues\u2026\nA truly free press?\nT\nhe Political Philosophy Society (PPS) held its first week\nlong \u2018Conflict Case Study\nWeek\u2019 kicking off with an academic\nstudy of the Israeli-Palestinian con-flict. However a last minute complaint and threat to pull out from\nparticipant Professor David Newman caused the PPS to switch panellist Dr Azzam Tamimi for Ghada\nKarmi to allow the event to continue\nwith all sides being represented.\nBut this caused its own flurry of\nnew problems with the organisers\nreceiving angry calls and emails from\nmembers of the public, furious at the\nPPS for bowing to \u2018Zionist pressure\u2019\nwhile also being criticised for limiting Freedom of Speech.\nIsraeli publications such as the Jerusalem Post and the Jewish Chronicle took a different stance, reporting\nthe PPS as a controversial society\nthat is comfortable with hosting\npanellists of an extremist ideology.\nAs a result, PPS Chairman, Ammar\nWaraich, issued a statement in which\nhe asserted the PPS\u2019s right to choose\npanellists freely in the society\u2019s pursuit of a free and fair exchange of\nideas, the disappointment of what he\ntermed the \u201chasty\u201d reporting by the\nJewish media and the PPS\u2019s decision\nto re-invite Dr Tamimi for a future\ndebate.\nEventually the debate went ahead,\nwith thorough discussion and a high\nturnout.\nPPS event borders on crisis\n2\n008 started with the official announcement that Phase Two\nof the Beit Masterplan had\nbeen given the green light. The Union finally secured a total of \u00a33.32m\nfrom College, the IC and Harlington\nTrusts, reclaimed VAT and left over\nmoney from the \u2018successful\u2019 first\nphase.\nThe redevelopment will eventually\nlead to a completely revamped Student Activities Centre located on the\nsecond floor mezzanine of the Union building. A new gym will be installed on the third floor and the Union meeting rooms will be relocated\nto the East Basement. Final improvements will be made to overhaul the\narchaic electrical and mechanical in-frastructure, plus energy efficiency\nmeasures have also been promised\nin the way of extra insulation, lighting control and double glazing.\nUnwritten College laws say that\ninitial projections of any redevelopment at Imperial will never materialise on time, and Phase Two is no\nexception. Work was originally due\nto commence in March, but the Union has since postponed these plans\nto the start of the new academic year\nin September.\nFelix will be taking bets in October\non what the first disruption to the\nredevelopment will be.\nBeit finally gets go-ahead\nN\news of more building project\ndelays broke in January\nwhen it was revealed by Felix that the ground floor of the Library would be opening 4 months\nlater than planned.\nFelix spoke to a senior member of\nthe College\u2019s Building Projects team\nwho requested to remain anony-mous. He described the set back as\na \u201cprocurement issue,\u201d meaning that\ndimensions drawn up in plans differed from those of the actual construction site.\nThe Library Redevelopment\u2019s\nProject Leader described the delay\nas \u201cdisappointing, but building work\ndoesn\u2019t always go to plan.\u201d\nWith the works running into the\nsummer months, many students using the library to revise for exams\nwere subject to not just construction\nnoise, but also the constantly Hellish\ntemperatures on the upper levels of\nthe Library. However, despite over\n\u00a310m having been spent on the Library\u2019s entire refurbishment, a solution for the sub-tropical temperatures has yet to be announced, with\nonly air conditioning for the ground\nand third floors included in the current redevelopment.\nThat\u2019s another reason for students\nto look forward to the end of exam\ntime then...\nLibrary refurbishment stalls\nA\ns Ethos celebrated its second birthday, College stated that plans for its third\nyear did not include the introduction of membership fees for stu-dents. Whilst Ethos Centre Manager, Ian Reid proclaimed a \u201cgreat\nyear\u201d, fears surfaced that Ethos\nwould follow suit of other London student sports facilities and\ncharge a regular fee for gym use.\nHowever, only further integration\ninto Imperial\u2019s South Kensington\ncampus was on the agenda for the\nnew year ahead including greater\ninteraction with IC sports teams\nand increased communication\nwith students about health and\nfitness.\nEthos to\nremain free\nC\noncerns over College\u2019s refusal to grant full-time student\nstatus to PhD students in\ntheir writing-up period were raised\nin March after the Camden Council\ntook Matthew Yong to court over\nunpaid Council Tax.\nUnder government legislation,\nstudents are defined as those attending a course which lasts more than\none year, for more than 24 weeks per\nyear in which more than 21 hours of\nwork are completed per week. Matthew Yong felt that he fit this definition and so with the support of ICU,\nhis supervisors and local Conservative councillor Chris Philp \u2013 but not\nthe support of the college \u2013 he took\nhis battle to the courts.\nAt the eleventh hour, outside the\ncourtroom, Mr Yong was told by\nCamden Council that they were\ndropping the legal action and he was\nissued a summons withdrawal no-tice, declaring the Council\u2019s intention to drop the case.\nHowever, since then, Matthew\nYong has become caught in a legal\nlimbo. The council has not, in fact,\nretracted their Council Tax claim\nbut equally, they haven\u2019t taken Mr\nYong back to court.\nIn the meantime College is reviewing its policy on writing-up students,\nand since Mr Yong\u2019s almost-court\nappearance, IC has said it will \u201csupports\u201d the idea of writing up students\ngaining tax exemption in the future.\nWriting-up roundabout\nSabb-elects + pies = laughs\nAnd in\nother\nnews...\nPosters from the anti-Scientology group,\nAnonymous, popped up\non notice boards across\ncampus culminating in Felix\nreporting on a massive\ndemonstration outside the\nCoS\u2019 headquarters.\nThis year\u2019s RCSU Science\nChalllenge was another\nresounding success\nConcerned students from\nSilwood campus contacted\nFelix after stumbling upon\na greenhouse containing a\nradioactively contaminated\nplant\nFelix landed Chris Larvin,\nin a spot of bother with the\nEnvironmental Society. We\u2019re\nsorry Chris, that was rotten :-(\nD\nays after winning this year\u2019s\nSabbatical Elections, the incoming Presidents and Felix\nEditor faced their first test: how well\nthey could take a pie to the face.\nFelix organised a \u2018photo shoot\u2019\nunder the pretense that the pictures\nof the winning candidates would be\nappearing on the front cover of the\nnext issue.\nThis wasn\u2019t a complete lie, how-ever, as three of the five Sabb-elects\ndid end up on the front cover, albeit\ncovered in shaving foam standing\nalongside a giant ape belonging to\nthe C&G Hit Squad, who carried out\nthe pieing.\nThe remaining two winners were\nrelegated to the inside pages of Felix, however they didn\u2019t manage to\nescape their soapy fates either.\nThis publication\u2019s Editor has already booked his holidays for next\nyear, funnily enough around the\nmonths of February and March...\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix Friday 20 June 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nCaz Knight\nLet\u2019s talk about drugs\nH\nooray! Exams are over\nand the season to wreak\nhavoc is upon us. As I\nwrite this I still have a\nconsiderable amount of\nrevision to get done before next week,\nbut that should not taint the subject\nof my comment! I am in surprisingly\ngood spirits despite everyone around\nme celebrating their lack of commitment and responsibility by intoxicating themselves. Drugs. Has there ever\nbeen a more vague word? The word\ncould be referring to any of the hundreds of thousands of chemicals, man\nmade and naturally-occurring, that\ngrace this planet. However, when people use the term it is usually in relation\nto chemicals that are used for recrea-tion: for fun. I am a little hesitant on\nembarking on this subject for fear of\nbeing seen as one who is a) an \u2018addict\u2019\nor b) an endorser/pusher of inebriants/\nbad influence. Perhaps after reading\nthis you will have made up your mind\nabout where I stand on the matter.\nPart of the reason for voicing my\nopinion on this subject springs from\nthe recent re-classification of Marijuana. In 2004 it was moved from a\nClass B to a Class C drug, which includes other substances such as Ketamine and GHB. It will soon be a Class\nB once again, alongside drugs such as\nAmphetamines and Ritalin, due to the\nfact that apparently the \u2018dope\u2019 gracing our streets nowadays is \u201cstronger\u201d\nthan the stuff circulating in the swinging Sixties. This may be very true, and\nseveral friends who are partial to the\nGreen stuff have confirmed this. However, it is very hard to prove something\nlike the chemical composition of illegal\nplants when there is no system to regulate them. I am sure the Government\nwould rather just be safe than end up\nin twenty odd years with a huge NHS\nbill to pay for the hundreds/thousands\nof adults developing mental illness on\naccount of excessive use in their teen\nyears. Another colossal blanket statement I heard uttered on the news was\nthat \u201cyoung people are more at risk of\ntaking drugs because drugs are cheap.\u201d\nHA! I do not consider fifty pounds for\none gram of what is, in reality, only\n~10% of Columbian origin to be cheap!\nThe goods available on Camden Bridge\nare often a variety of cooking herb and\nthe hassle that is required to sequester the more clandestine substances\nis not symptomatic of a society where\nour children cannot move for drug\npushers.\nIalsotakeexceptiontotheabundance\nof ignorance that exists in relation to\nillegal drugs. I, being a biochemist/re-tard, am aware of exactly what happens\nto the body when certain chemicals hit\nour blood and brains (although, I still\nstruggle with the equation of a line).\nFriends of mine have sent me into\napoplectic frustration when they make\ncomments such as \u201cdrugs make you\nthirsty and so you drink so much water\nyou die\u201d. I doubt your average punter\nhas any clue as to the effects of most\nsubstances and more should be done\nto educate people: giving them unbiased information with which they can\nmake informed, adult decisions. (How-ever, a vast majority in this country is\nnot even capable of that, it seems).\nWhat so many people forget is that\nalcohol is a drug, one to which Britain\nis hopelessly addicted. In every form of\nmedia, it is referred to in isolation from\nthe \u201cbig, bad\u201d drugs. many of which are\njust as harmful or even less harmful\nthan alcohol.\n\u201cDo not mix drugs and alcohol\u201d. This\nis sound advice as ingesting a cocktail\nof chemicals (whatever the type, be it\nprescribed, Boots-bought or otherwise)\nis never wise given the risk of drug in-teractions. Does this mean we should\nnot mix alcohol with alcohol? Probably,\nas mixing one\u2019s drinks can often lead to\na hangover making you wish you were\nactually hardcore straight-edge.\nWhen you compare the data of the\n\u201cTwo E\u2019s\u201d (ethanol and ecstasy) it is\nquite clear that from both a medical and social point of view, ecstasy is\n\u2018better\u2019 for you. At the mention of Ecstasy people have the nineties-painted\nstereotype of sweaty, water-swigging\nravers hugging each other (\u201cI love you,\nmate\u201d). But, compare 10 deaths per\nannum from ecstasy to 22,000 alcohol\nrelated deaths. Admittedly, there are\nmany, many more ethanol \u201cusers\u201d than\nthat of ecstasy but I am sure if you calculated deaths as a percentage of users,\nalcohol would come out worse. There\nis no heart, liver or cardiovascular disease associated with MDMA (ecstasy\u2019s\nchemical name) and absolutely no\nnegative social impact from it either.\nAll the brawls, vomit, glass and kebab detritus are from alcohol abusers.\nAgain, I am a hypocrite. I do enjoy a\ntipple or two but I have never caused a\nfight, eaten a kebab or dirtied the street\nin anyway in my drunken state.\nCurrently, medical research is underway to examine MDMA as a tool\nin psychotherapy and marriage counselling on account of its effects which\ninduce an increased empathy for one\u2019s\npeers, breaking down barriers that\nyears of resentment could have built.\nIndeed, shortly after its creation by\nAlexander Shulgin in Germany, it was\nbeing used as a \u201ctruth serum\u201d in WWI\n(to no great success).\nI have tried and tried, and to no avail,\nto find through PubMed any research\njournals which describe the long and\nshort-term effects (both on the body\nand on the brain) of LSD. It seems\nthe only risks associated are \u2018flashbacks\u2019 (rare in any case) and impaired\njudgments whilst under the influ-ence, exactly like alcohol. Oh, and one\nshouldn\u2019t take it if pregnant because it\nmay cause uterine contractions. Not\nreally an issue for most: any woman\nconsidering any drugs while pregnant\nis very unwise.\nPlease do not assume I am encouraging people to experiment unwisely\nand with gay abandon (if at all). Whatever be your poison, moderation and\nbalance is key. People who think that\ntaking one pill a few times a month\nis worse for you than heavy drinking\nseveral times a week are gravely mis-taken. However, if the bi-monthly pill\nis having an effect on your work/life/\nrelationships/health then it is time to\nstop.\nFor a lot of people, exercising moderation is beyond them and so Britain\nhas a binge drinking epidemic. But for\nnow, exams desist, spirits are high (pun\ncompletely and utterly intended) and I\nbid you a fantastic summer!\n\u201c\nI take\nexception to\nthe abundance\nof ignorance\nthat exists in\nrelation to illegal\ndrugs\n\u201d\nA. Geek\nThat\u2019s all, folks\nA\nlright, I admit it. Things\ngot the better of me last\nweek. Those bastard\nthings. God knows why I\nfeel the need to apologise\nto you, but Tomo\u2019s mournful footnote\nnudged me towards guilt last week, so,\nwell, I\u2019m sorry. Okay? I didn\u2019t mean to\nhurt you.\nThe fact is, it\u2019s Summer now. You\nknow it, I know it, the guy who designs\nthe uniforms for Starbucks coffee evidently knows it. Believe it or not, this\nweek\u2019s column comes to you all the\nway from a glamorous holiday loca-tion. A Geek is on vacation.\nThis is good for a variety of reasons.\nFirstly, I can forget the NUS exists. I\nget that nice feeling of peace that I assume the GI\u2019s also felt when they took\nleave in Paris during World War 2. Sipping absinthe, with the sound of Kirsty\nPatterson being dropped out of a B52\nsomewhere in the east. Distant carnage \u2013 the best kind of carnage there\nis. I\u2019ve even got a Crunchie.\nOther than distance from the Union\nSenate Council Committee, and the\npresence of a bar of milk chocolate with\na golden honeycombed centre, life\u2019s\nalso good because there\u2019s nothing for\nme to do except wear sunglasses that\ndon\u2019t suit me, and play a hell of a lot of\nGuitar Hero 3. Fuck the advancement\nof human understanding for a week or\ntwo \u2013 I\u2019ve got a date with Sunshine Of\nYour Love on Hard.\nI feel bad for liking Guitar Hero 3 so\nmuch, because it\u2019s one of those shitty\nhalfway house games. On the one\nhand, it\u2019s hip and esoteric enough to\nalienate a lot of gamers (if you\u2019re not\naware, it\u2019s played by strangling an actual plastic guitar to death in your living room) but on the other hand I look\nlike a cock who prefers videogames to\ndrugs,concertsandbooze.Therefresh-ing combination of looking like a twat\nand even repelling nerds is strangely\nappealing to me, though. Sometimes I\neven whammy a bit.\nThat\u2019s what I like about videogames,\nfilm, and being eleven years old. They\nall let you pretend and imagine things\nin an entirely safe environment. Sure,\nAmmar Waraich has stared into the\nabyss of human nature, wheras the\nbest I\u2019ve managed is to stare into the\nhigh scoreboard of Talk Dirty To Me.\nAnyone who pens pseudo-intellectual\ncrap in the Games section is kidding\nthemselves if they think the real world\nis comparable to a 17\u201d monitor. But it\noffers respite and entertainment. And\nso far, no-one\u2019s proved it to be addict-ing. Which is nice.\nWhy take second-best to reality? Because I, like many of you, are power-re-laxing this Summer. Placements, work\nexperience and internships mean that\nmagical \u201cfour-month\u201d holiday is disembowelled until a paltry few weeks\nremain. Once the full Imperial exodus\nis completed for you \u2013 savour the last\ndays of halls, first years \u2013 you may find\nless time to read Dawkins\u2019 complete\nworks than you thought (I\u2019m missing\nyou more than him, Garnet).\nSo even though your year has only\njust ended, don\u2019t put off relaxation.\nSpend a little extra money, see Hyde\nPark before you leave, and remember\nto take a pigeon home for your younger brother.\n\u201c\nBelieve\nit or not, this\nweek\u2019s column\ncomes to you\nall the way from\na glamorous\nholiday location.\nA Geek is on\nvacation.\nWhy the happy ending to a year of\nA Geek? I think it\u2019s just the escape out\nof London. The greyness disappears,\nand like that expensive mouthwash on\nTV, you can see the anger flying out\nwith it into the metaphorical sink. I\u2019ve\nbecome a Guitar Hero, and the sun\u2019s\nshining. And I\u2019ve got a Crunchie. This\nis fucking amazing.\nTune in next year, I guess. Until\nthen, continue being idiotic, hypocritical and greedy, folks. I\u2019ll be taking\nnotes.\nDear Editors,\nI am writing about your article 'Men-tal health at IC: Who cares?' in last\nweek's Felix. The Student Counselling Service welcomes the raising of\nthe important issue of student mental health. Students need to know\nwho they can contact if they are\nexperiencing mental health difficulties whilst at College. Unfortunately,\nthere seems to have been a misunderstanding about the composition\nof mental health facilites at College; the overall facility on campus\nis much larger than you describe.\nAs well as the Student Counselling\nService, Imperial College Health\nCentre offers its own counselling fa-cility; inclusion of information from\nthe Health Centre gives a more comprehensive picture.\nFurther information about student\ncounselling at Imperial can be found\nat www.imperial.ac.uk/counselling\nand at www.imperialcollegehealth-centre.co.uk\nRegards,\nDavid Allman\nSenior Student Counsellor\nStudent Counselling Service\nLetter to Felix\nMental health\nfacilities\nclarification\nMany thanks to everyone at Felix.\nI\u2019m sorry I was unable to make it\nto the meetup, but you probably\ndidn\u2019t have Crunchies anyway.\nIt\u2019s been a great year, kudos to\nTom and the Dep Eds for keeping\nthe paper running through the\ntough summer weeks. Looking\nforward to next year with you all.\nMuch love,\nThe G\n\n"

Undefeated all year and\nonly dropping one game, the team comfortably\nwon their league and went on to win the BUSA\nShield, a national competition. Rather unsurpris-ingly, they came top of the felix sports league with\na staggering 70 points, 19 points clear of second\nplace. Well done lads, let\u2019s hope for a repeat performance next season.\nNetball 2nd\nBest Medic Team\nOut of all the medical teams, the Women\u2019s Netball 2nds team have stood head and shoulders\nabove the rest. Coming in at 9th place, which is\ncommendable in its own right, they are also 6\nplaces clear from their closest competitor, the\nwomen\u2019s hockey team, and have performed well,\nonly losing two games.

Their contribution to the final\nBUSA points count is the same as all the other\nclubs put together, and for that reason alone, they\nare this year Club of the Year.

With the introduction of a new\npresident and a range of successful social events\nthroughout the year the hockey club has made\nthe union proud!\nWell here we are, the end of the season\nand my last issue as Sport Editor. And\nwhat better way than to have a roundup of the year in the for of an awards\nceremony. The league table has been\nrunning all season, and even though\npeople have come up to me from time\nto time saying they don\u2019t think the\ntable is as fair as it could be, which I\nagree with, but since no-one offered a\nreasonable alternative we\u2019ve stuck with\nit and it has ended up being a great\nsuccess. Next year, a new version will\nbe created which we think will be fairer\nfor all the teams involved.\nSo on to the awards. Most of the\ndecisions were based on the current\nleague table which meant that IC\nSquash Men\u2019s 1st team came on top.\nCongratulations guys. We have some\nt-shirts for you guys, please come to\nthe office to collect them. We then\nmove on to the best of the rest, both\nmale and female, and similarly for the\nworst teams. There are a few teams\nwho, unfortunately, have not managed\nto win a game all season in the BUSA\nleagues, although I have assurances\nthat they faired better in the ULU\nleagues. Hopefully next season will be\nThe winners are...\na better one for them all.\nLastly we have the club awards and\nwe start with Worst Club of the Year.\nThis award is purely awarded on the results that all the teams in the club have\nachieved that season, and unfortunately for the medics rugby club, they came\nbottom, although I imagine they can\ntake solace in the fact that they beat all\nthe IC rugby teams at Varsity this year,\nagain! At the other end of the table,\nmainly due to the fact that the Squash\nMen\u2019s 1st were such convincing winners in the team league table, meant\nthat the club as a whole did very well.\nThis is not taking anything away from\nthe other squash teams, as they also\nperformed well coming 11th, 20th and\n26th. But the Club of the Year award\nwent to a club that has performed exceptionally well this season, IC Boat\nClub, and hopefully it will continue to\ndo the same next year.\nAll that\u2019s left for me to say is well\ndone to all the teams this year, it looks\nas though it has been a tremendous\nseason for both Imperial and the Medicals, and I hope that you all continue\nto send in your reports to next year\u2019s\nsports editors, Jack Cornish and Mustapher Botchway.

But why has homegrown talent\nhad such a hard time establishing itself\non the international scene?\nPart of the answer lies in the void\nthe country found itself in during the\npre-Cultural Revolution years of Communism \u2013 though versatile, the era\u2019s\nstandard-issue tunics were not the\nmost expressive medium for a budding\ndesigner. In the years after, though released from the restraints of ideological uniform, a new generation of Chinese seem to have been uncertain with\nwhat constituted a modern national\naesthetic, having been robbed of a\nnatural stylistic evolution from the nation\u2019s sartorial heyday of the decadent\n1930\u2019s. In a sense, its creative development has been stunted in comparison\nwith neighbours such as Japan.\nThough China\u2019s teeming population and creative hotspots will surely\nharbour an impressive array of tal-ent, it has thus far lacked the creative\ninfrastructure that the world\u2019s other\nmajor fashion capitals take for granted\n\u2013 trade shows, fashion weeks, funding\ninitiatives, creative management, media support \u2013 all of which help in the\ncreation of viable businesses from raw\ntalent.\nAnd though Beijing and Shanghai\u2019s\nfashion weeks are important additions\nto China\u2019s fashion calendar, too often\nthe important front row is littered with\nlocal dignitaries and public figures, as\nopposed to oft decisive and influential\ninternational fashion press and buy-ers. Consumer resistance that values\nprestige over supporting novel design\ntalent has also contributed to the difficulties faced by local designers. But\nin spite of the potential difficulties\nfaced, the creation of quietly discerning shopping streets in Hong Kong and\nShanghai\u2019s Taikang Lu and Chang Le\nselling local designers\u2019 creations have\nshown promise.\nMost people would have trouble\nnaming a true Chinese fashion design\ntalent, one based in China or who\nemerged from China. That much is\nreasonable, even amongst the world\u2019s\nfashionistas. However, the annals of\nmodern fashion have been studded\nwith designers of Chinese origin. In\nthis context, the most notable event\nin the international fashion calendar\nis New York fashion week. Vera Wang\nand Anna Sui are now important biannual fixtures in the city and the\nmost successful, while smaller names\nsuch as Chinese-Malaysian Yeohlee and the design duo Bamboo have\ncarved out dedicated fanbases. In ad-dition, the runway shows showcasing\nthe talents of Alexander Wang, Philip\nLim and Derek Lam are among some\nof the most eagerly anticipated in the\ncity.\nSo do normal Chinese regard them\nas national successes and champion\nthem as their own? Virginia Lau, an\ninternational trend forecaster based\nin Hong Kong, elaborates upon the\nsituation: \u201cYes and no. We\u2019ve become\naware of them in recent seasons. We\nChina\u2019s economic growth and increasingly numerous middle class have buoyed the ever-precarious interntational market for luxury goods\n\u201cWe are looking\nforward to\nseeing someone\nfrom China\nbecoming a\nhighly-regarded\ninternational\ndesigner\u201d\nknow they're upcoming designers and\nbecoming famous in New York.\u201d But\nis that enough for a nation known for\nits fierce sense of identity? \u201cWe are\nwaiting and looking forward to seeing\nsomeone from China become a highly-regarded international designer very\nsoon \u2013 someone who grew up here,\nspeaks Chinese and lives here.\u201d Are\nthere any potential candidates? \u201cI think\nmost Chinese would consider Xie Feng\nwith his designer label Jefen as the first\nChinese designer to have stepped onto\nthe international fashion runway stage.\nHe presented his first ready-to-wear\ncollection in Paris for Spring 2007.\u201d\nPerhaps it may be the case that a label\nwould have to be exported to gain international recognition before returning or simply, in addition to better\ninfrastructure, designers would have\nto become more aware of the world\naround them in order to better appeal\nto a global audience.\nConsequently, there is a desire to see\nlocal talent hitting the largest stage of\nthem all. But what would they present\nas a declaration of modern Chinese\nfashion? What is it to dress Chinese?\nMost people\u2019s perceptions of a Chinese\naesthetic still reach back to the long,\nflowing costume presented to Western\naudiences in large-scale Chinese cinematic epics, or decadent and slinky\nform-fitted cheongsam (also known as\nqipao). Maggie Cheung\u2019s painstakingly\nfitted cheongsam in the opulently stylised Hong Kong film In The Mood For\nLove is probably one of the most well\nknown examples. \u201cWe hold our Chinese heritage dear, but young Chinese\ndon\u2019t want anything too clich\u00e9\u201d, says\nSally Yau, a Shanghai fashion journalist\nand writer. \u201cNo one wants to dress like\ntheir grandmother\u201d. The concept of\n\u201cvintage\u201d and \u201cretro\u201d is also somewhat\ntricky in a nation that was dressed almost exclusively in Mao suits. Deconstructionism is becoming a buzzword\namongst local designers on the Mainland while in Hong Kong, great emphasis is placed on the cut, folds, embroidery and detail, \u201cin no small part\nthanks to the tropical climate and the\ncity\u2019s strong tailoring heritage\u201d, adds\nYau.\nHave China\u2019s regional neighbours\nhad any influence on its sense of style?\n\u201cInfluences from Japan and Korea are\nalways strong in Asia, especially in the\nyouth and junior markets\u201d says Lau.\n\u201cIn the last three to four years, the\ninfluence of Korean trends have been\nparticularly strong and are regarded\nas even hotter than those from Japan,\nwhich have had a very strong influence on Asian fashion since the early\n80's\u201d. Which aspects of Korean culture\nare having an impact on the Chinese\nmarket? \u201cKorean celebrities, television\ndramas, movies, fashion brands, magazines and beauty brands are prevailing\nand selling like hot cakes in Asia. Korean labels sell at a higher price than\nlocal retail brands in China, and Asian\ngirls follow makeup trends from Korean artists\u201d.\nSo China as a consumer \u2013 taking 10%\nof the world\u2019s luxury sales \u2013 is increasingly voracious for all things covetable,\nand as a creator has still some way to\ngo despite showing promise. This is\nwithout even accounting for its massive presence in the textiles industry\nas a manufacturer and exporter. Is\nthe world of fashion ready for such a\nchange? How will the world\u2019s fashion\npress react to an influx of new Chinese\ndesigners boldly presenting their vision for a new China, and how much\nof it will be tempered by a desire to appease and offer something palatable to\nWestern sensibilities? It seems only a\nmatter of time before China closes the\ngap and the international fashion landscape as we know it is altered forever.\nLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s for the best.\nWith special thanks to Virginia\nLau.\n\n"

Awesome cheesecake with\nmandarin puree and a cinnamon biscuit base. We\u2019ll be emailing the prize\nwinner next week hopefully, assuming I find the time. If not, July...\nHow to play:\nCrudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar to Minesweeper mixed with a\ndash of Sudoku.\nThe object of the game is to draw\nlines between the dots to create one\nlong, and most importantly, looping\nline. It should have no start or finish;\njust like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many\nlines should be drawn around it, for\nexample:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number\ncan be surrounded by any number of\nlines.\nRemember, the line must form a\nloop, so the line cannot branch. The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink grid is by drawing crosses\naround any zeros. Drawing crosses\nis purely done to so that you know\nwhere there can\u2019t possibly be a line.\nSo, take the pattern below as an ex-ample. Begin by drawing crosses,\nthen by filling in some lines:\nNow the lines can only continue in\nthe following directions:\nSlitherlink 1,408\n3\n2 2\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n1,407 solution\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\nTEXT US!

    "content": "felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel\nthere is nothing like the feeling of having to search for and track wildlife in\nthe wild and there is nothing like the\nexperience of taking your time watching them from up close while they enact their normal lives.\nMy most memorable wildlife experience was the time I spent alone with\na family of lions. My driver and I left\nearly to find some active hunts and\nchanced upon a family of these large\ncats gorging on a fresh wildebeest kill.\nIt was an electric feeling hearing them\npant over the kill as they cracked ribs\nand shared the meat, knowing all the\nwhile that if I was to dare to step outside my vehicle, I would share the same\nfate as the wildebeest.\nOther such experiences were my first\never leopard and cheetah sightings.\nThe leopard we encountered accidentally in the undergrowth before working hard at tracking it for a further 5\nhours, all for a handful of photographs;\nwhile the cheetah we spotted in the\nopen savannah plains, but in the greed\nof watching it sprint and hunt, we\nended up wasting a whole day watching it merely roll about on its sides re-peatedly. Despite their tediousness, the\npatience required for these sightings\nmade them really satisfying when they\ndid happen.\nTo get the complete bush experience,\nI also camped out under the stars and\namongst the wildlife at certain other\nsafari parks. At Lake Nakuru I was (un)\nlucky enough to witness a family of 7\nlions encircle my camp, while at Amboseli, it was hyenas and elephants\nencircling causing a bit of a racket. But\nwhile doing so, I also learnt to watch\nout for pests such as the Vervet Monkeys and Baboons of Lake Nakuru who\nphysically and unashamedly snatched\nfood from my hands and stole food\nfrom my vehicle.\nEssential Experience 3 \u2013 Visiting\nUganda\nWhile visiting East Africa, do not\nmiss out on Uganda. I nearly overlooked it in favour of Rwanda and Congo but it holds many great attractions.\nA great place to start is the source of\nthe Nile River at Jinja, on the edge of\nLake Victoria. This is one of the few\nplaces on Earth where you can experience white-water rafting in class 6 rap-ids, the fiercest form of rapids.\nWikipedia describes class 6 rapids as:\n\u201cso dangerous as to be effectively un-navigable on a reliably safe basis. Rafters can expect to encounter substantial\nwhitewater, huge waves, huge rocks\nand hazards, and/or substantial drops\nthat will impart severe impacts beyond\nthe structural capacities and impact\nratings of most all rafting equipment.\nTraversing a class 6 rapid has a dramatically increased likelihood of ending in\nserious injury or death compared to\nlesser classes\u201d.\nI was obviously not skilled enough to\ntake on the class 6 rapids, but proudly\nmanaged to complete class 5 rapids.\nHowever, the thrill was more than\nmatched by the fear I experienced\nevery time I fell out of the raft and was\ndragged through underwater streams\nand amongst rocks for periods lasting\nup to a minute, while my limbs were\npulled in all directions.\nWhile the above is evidently not for\nthe faint-hearted, a visit to the serene\nLake Bunyoni may be. Found in the\nsouth of the country this beautiful and\nstill lake is the perfect place to unwind\nfor a day or two. Walks amongst local villages and boating opportunities\nbetween the many islands of the lake\nmade it a great spot of relaxation and\nphotography for me.\nUganda also offers the rare opportunity to track chimpanzees in its forests.\nKibale Forest National Park in western-ish Uganda has the highest concentration of primates in the world and has\nwell trained guides that can help you\ntrack chimps but personally I found\nit to be a bit expensive, tedious and\ntiring. But I cannot deny that the few\nglimpses I got of the shy chimpanzees\nin the wild were a lot of fun.\nAs far as cities go, Uganda has my favourite city in East Africa \u2013 Kampala.\nIt has a great hustle bustle to it and a\nstimulating design. I thoroughly enjoyed the varied international cuisine\nand photographic opportunities of\nthe crazy taxi stand and market stalls.\nMoreover, it offered a vibrant shopping scene and a charming landscape,\nbeing dominated by a hill on which\nstood a mosque commissioned by Idi\nAmin on one side, flanked by another\nhill on which stood a Hindu temple! It\nwas also good banter scooting around\non the zippy motorbike taxis here as\nwell as discovering the only Nandos\nrestaurant in East Africa. Being an addict of Nandos, this really was a god-send. But a bit more quirkiness can be\nfound in a visit to the second largest\ncity of Uganda, Fort Portal. It is basically built around one main road and\npeculiarly, is the home of a delicious\nbakery improbably tucked into one\ncorner of the town that sells amazing\ncakes and is raved on about by all the\ntourists and locals combined. It also\nhas a few weird little eateries and a\nsuper-cool mosque. The people here\nI found to be the friendliest and most\ncurious out of all in East Africa.\nA young male lion resting in the golden grass of the Maasai Mara\nA cheetah on the lookout\nA baboon.

Felix\u2019s Efterklang correspondant Guy Andrews spoke to\nband member Casper Clausen shortly before their show at The Queen Elizabeth Hall\nO\nutside London there\nare lots of other places,\nfor example Glasgow,\nBristol and Norwich.\nEven further afield,\nthere are places such as France and\neven Singapore. As exam season\nfinally gets around to pissing itself out\nand the summer holidays open their\narms wide, embracing us into their\nwelcoming bosom, many of us will\nbe returning to our places of origin\noutside of South Kensington to while\naway our summer months, get jobs, or\ndo whatever it is we like to do when\nwe aren\u2019t doing science.\nMusic-wise, some people are much\nluckier than others when it comes\nto where they will be heading to in\nthe next few weeks. If you read these\npages often enough you will have\nno question that for those staying in\nLondon over the summer there will\nbe enough stuff going on to keep\nyou entertained. This time of year in\nparticular is good for day festivals,\nnot to mention that Radiohead thing\nthat everyone is boning on about. But\nnonetheless, there are a lot of towns in\nthe UK that can definitely hold their\nown musically.\nLast weekend I headed down to\nBrighton for a dubstep and drum\nn\u2019 bass night at a venue called the\nConcord 2. For those who have never\nbeen, Brighton is a 50-minute train\njourney southwards to the coast. It\nwas popular with the Victorians as it\u2019s\nthe nearest seaside resort to London,\nand to this day it\u2019s retained the same\nkind of seedy, pleasure-seeking vibe it\nno doubt had back then. Hedonistic\nwould be an appropriate description if\nit didn\u2019t require the expenditure of so\nmuch energy. In Brighton, history and\ngeography have joined forces to make\nthe city, for it\u2019s size, one of the most\ncreative and artist friendly places in\nthe UK, and although it\u2019s not particularly known for it\u2019s dubstep, it seemed\nperfectly able to hold it\u2019s own in this\ncapacity (perhaps it\u2019s all the drugs it\ntakes on the weekends).\nMusic from Brighton though has\nit\u2019s own distinctive style. It\u2019s home to\ntwo of my favourite record labels, Tru\nThoughts and FatCat Records, which\nare two of the best known names in\neclectic alternative bigting eazy-vibez.\nAs for individuals, the town is home\nto a mix of artists from just about\nevery genre, from the latin funk/soul\nof Quantic to the scary mustachioed\ngoth-rock of Nick Cave, to the dulcet\ntones of the speaking clock voice, Sara\nMendes da Costa. If you\u2019re into the\nweirder side of a weird enough town,\nthere\u2019s a night called The Halloween\nClub showcasing some of the more\nbizarre acts of the Brighton music\nscene. I\u2019ve heard legends of an ambient free-form jazz Mexican wrestler\nband, and a guy inserting things into\nhis ass while miming a handjob on the\nmicrophone. He probably played some\nkind of music too.\nSo the moral of the story is: Brighton is awesome. Also: Have a nice sum-mer. Also: I need to leave for France in\n2 fucking hours and I haven\u2019t fucking\npacked. And I don\u2019t know french. See\nyou all next year!\nS\nince it\u2019s release in October\nof last year, Efterklang\u2019s \u2018Parades\u2019 LP has been a runaway\nsuccess. Most electronica\nfans will eagerly tell you they\nwould literally piss their pants if they\ngot the chance to meet them, so we\njumped at the chance last April when\nvocalist and multi-instrumentalist\nCasper Clausen agreed to meet up\nwith for a chat and a sit-down.\nHow did you first get into writing\nmusic?\nThat\u2019s a tough one. Three of us grew up\nin the same city, went to high school together and were in a lot of cover bands\ntogether. Writing our own music was\njust something that naturally came out\nof playing other people\u2019s songs.\nDid you ever have intentions of\ngetting signed when you were in\nthese cover bands?\nThe music we were making was pretty\nbad in the early days. Of course we\nwanted to get signed but in retrospect\nthere wasn\u2019t really anything there. Before we started Efterklang we spent\nabout three years working on a com-puter, figuring out the ProTools system\nand writing out little sketches. We took\nout a big bank loan and purchased a\nload of instruments and met Thomas\nand Rune before making our first EP.\nWhere did you record all your\nsongs?\nWe had this room in Copenhagen that\nwe used for 5 or 6 years \u2013 we\u2019d both\npractise and record there. Recently we\ngot kicked out of that space and had to\nmove into a new room. It\u2019s a lot worse\nas it doesn\u2019t have the nice natural re-verb and sound that the original room\nhad.\nWhere do you get your inspir-ation?\nIt comes from small things, things you\nread, see, hear. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really\nclear on what exactly inspires me\u2026 you\ncan feel when the inspiration is there\u2026\nusually after watching a nice movie I\nwant to get creative. We also get a lot\nof inspiration from other bands we listen to.\nOn your latest album \u2018Parades\u2019,\nyou\u2019ve swung toward a more live\nsound which is quite different to\nthe more electronic feel of your\nprevious two albums. What was\nthe reason behind this?\nI think actually half of it came from us\nwanting to do something more natural sounding. From \u2018Tripper\u2019 we\nlearnt quite a lot \u2013 like how to\nmelt acoustic sounds with electronic sounds, we just couldn\u2019t\ndo it that well. \u2018Parades\u2019 was\njust a pure mix of the two,\nmelted together to create\na sound that blurred the\nline between electronic\nand acoustic.\nSome of the songs\nare quite complex\nin both melody and\nstructure. How do\nyou go about writing\nsuch tunes? Are these\ncomplexities planned\nor do they come out\nwhilst playing together?\nThere\u2019s no improvis-ing, everything\nis built up from the beginning. Occasionally I\u2019ll sit infront of an interesting\ninstrument like a celesta or piano and\nwill just play around, it could be a fragment of what I\u2019m playing that I decide\nto record. Then it\u2019s a case of muddling\ntogether a load of ideas, over and over\nagain until something strange happens\nand it develops into a song. Sometimes\nI find myself walking into the next\nroom and listening to the song through\nthe wall, it\u2019s a great way to hear if something is missing.\nAre your songs hard to translate\ninto a live set?\nIt depends how much you want to\nrecreate the song. With \u2018Tripper\u2019 we\njust threw the record on the ground\nand built up a live version. We normally run to a rough structure in a song\nand extend and shorten bits if they\nwork live.\nOn a more general note, who are\nyou current influences?\nAt the moment I\u2019m listening to a lot\nof Daft Punk. When we were making\nParades we were listening to a lot of\nPopol Vuh, a german band. Also Grizzly Bear, Bj\u00f6rk, Radiohead, a lot of artists on our label Leaf. It\u2019s great being\non the same label as some artists that\nreally inspire us.\nWhat interests do you have outside of music?\nI like collecting clothes. I really like\ndesigning clothes too. My sister and\nI designed the clothes we wear when\nperforming live and have just made\nsome new ones using inspiration from\nthe last ones we designed.\nWhat prompted you to start up\nyour own label Rumraket?\nWhen we were hand making our first\nEP \u2018Springer\u2019 we just wanted to put a\nlabel name on it to make it sound more\nprofessional. So we came up with the\nlogo and stuck that on the CD. We also\nhand made 1000 copies of \u2018Tripper\u2019\nand put the Rumraket logo on that.\nIf your house or studio was\nburning down, what would\nbe the first thing you would\ngrab?\nThe hard-drive! The computer\nis really the heart of the entire\nband \u2013 all our ideas are collected on the hard-drive.\nWhat is the one thing that\u2019s\nthe most crucial part of the live\nperfomance?\nMaybe the lead vocals! [laughs] Probably Mads on the computer. We want\nto try and move away from the computer to give us a challenge but we know\nwe\u2019ll always come back to that fucking\ncomputer.\nEfterklang are due to play the last few shows\nof their solo tour shortly, before hitting the festival circuit\nthis summer. You can catch them in the UK one of a few\ndates, including a London show at the Field Day Festival in\nVictoria Park on August the 9th. See www.efterklang.org for more info\n\n"

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFriday 20 June 2008 felix\nGames\nMetal Gear Solid, but there was a part\nof me, a tiny part of me, that felt that\nall the touted features of psychological\nwarfare and advanced stealth would\ntake a backseat. Wow. Did I ever call\nit wrong.\nFew games will have ever, and not\nonly in the Metal Gear Solid series,\noffered a package so compelling, so\nengrossing or so puissant in terms of\ngameplay. Whether it\u2019s the sheer variety or the way that the setpieces are designed to genuinely evoke emotion and\nadrenaline rushes, you\u2019ll be spoilt once\nyou finish this masterpiece.\nGunplay has never been a focus for\nthe highly stealth-oriented series, but\nthis iteration really reveals one of MGS\u2019\ntruly spontaneous draws: freedom\nwithin linearity. Your overall mission\nmay be from one point to the other, but\nthe staggering amount of choice you\nhave between these two is often aston-ishing. To keep things organic, there\nare no explicit instructions to embark\non these paths but it\u2019s left completely\nup to the discerning player to carve his\nown gameplay niche.\nWhether you\u2019re going to risk freeing some freedom fighters to aid you\nagainst the PMCs or enter the fracas\nwith the highly-refined shooting mod-el, or even stay out of harm\u2019s way by\nsending the remote-controlled miniscule Metal Gear Mk. II unit to scout on\nahead, these things are never openly\nstated. You\u2019ll do what you feel like doing and it\u2019s your own way that\u2019s the\nright way. It\u2019s an interesting vision of\nthe \u201csandbox\u201d concept of gaming.\nThe Metal Gear Solid family has always been an intensely ecumenical\nexperience with regards to everything\nthat it incorporates. And what is a\ngame such as this without the aural\nbrilliance? To that end, composer Harry-Gregson Williams and his Konami\ncounterpart whip up a maelstrom of\nsublime orchestral music. It\u2019s not only\nthe incredibly emotive tracks that impressed me but the way it was lovingly\nincorporated into the right moments\nwas astonishing. Operatic and melo-dramatic? Yup, but then you\u2019ll only\nhave used a few of many words used to\ndescribe the Metal Gear Solid saga.\nAnd the accolades can simply continue for this title of titles. I can mention\nthe incessant urge to collect each type\nof the hundred-shy weapons offered in\nthe game in order to exchange points\nwith the enigmatic gun \u201claunderer\u201d\nDrebin 893. I can talk about the clever\nproduct placement in the game, where\nyou can use a fully functioning iPod\nto listen to music tracks spanning the\nKonami library. I can mention the boss\nfights that blend in the right amount\nof emotion, innovation and nostalgia;\nsome of them are quite clever. There\u2019s\nalso the fact that the enemies are a\nfar more intelligent bunch, challenging you to really test your mettle. Did\nI care to nod towards the new Metal\nGear Gekkou and Mini Gekkou units?\nIn size they fail to match REX and Ray\nbut the combination of sheer fear and\nadrenaline they evoke in you during\nyour encounters is quite incredible.\nAnd then there\u2019s the bit in Act 4 that...\nwell, you\u2019ll find out soon enough.\nA word about the much-touted\nBeauty and the Beast Unit of bosses\nmust be said though. I can understand\nthe thematic natures involved and\nheck, I think their stories explore the\nsort of macabre nature worthy of Poe,\nKing and Gaiman and finally, I think\nfighting them was a blast. Why does\nit bother me though? There\u2019s just this\ndisconnect between all these individually brilliant bits that lessen the impact\nfrom these contributions quite a lot, in\nmy opinion.\nWhat makes it all so \u201cfucking hilarious\u201d, in the words of the first boss you\nface, is that the portions detrimental to\nthe game range from invoking shrug-worthy ignorance to taking the opportunity for a toilet break. The game\nhas some lengthy install times between\neach act. Check. The cutscenes are\nlong for the attention-challenged (you\ncan pause or skip them now). Check.\nThe classic MGS humour is present,\nalthough a lot of the references will\neither evade newcomers or cause fans\nto face palm. Check. And there\u2019s some\nridiculously tedious method required\nto sign up for the Metal Gear Online\ngaming service. Fortunately it\u2019s optional but I\u2019m quite certain many of you\nwould love to take your single player\nskills onto the online space. Konami\nhave not made it easy to do so.\nHowever, we\u2019ve come to it at last: the\nlast Metal Gear Solid title from auteur,\ngenius and madman Hideo Kojima.\nWhen all is said is done, your own\nexpectations matter little; it stings a\nbit knowing that, but I digress. Less a\ngame and more of a highly insane, intense and powerfully personal experi-ence, there are few titles like this out\nthere. Driven on by one man\u2019s vision\nto tell a tale for the ages, you\u2019ll find\nyourself in a world not unlike our own,\nfull of people and places that truly end\nup mattering to you. All the questions\nyou\u2019ve ever had are answered with introspection and poise and finally, you\ncan sigh with relief as the multiple\nthreads finally come together in the final knit. It\u2019s far from perfect, but that\u2019s\nwhat makes it beautiful. That\u2019s what\nmakes it a Metal Gear.\nSatiating your appetite by answering old questions and then asking some thought-provoking ones of its own, MGS4 salutes the player in style\nTHE\nEND\nStealth through\nthe ages\nSeries hero Solid Snake\nburst onto the scene back\nin 1987 with the game\nMetal Gear on the MSX.\nA few years later this was\nfollowed up by the sequel\nMetal Gear 2: Solid Snake.\nIt would be many a year\nand an entire perspective\nshift until the series would\nresurface. Metal Gear Solid\nwas released in 1998 on the\nPlayStation to thunderous\nacclaim and cemented the\nseries in the annals of gaming history. The controversial PS2 title Metal Gear\nSolid 2: Sons of Liberty\nfollowed suit in 2001, earning a place in the Guiness\nBook of World Records re-cently. MGS3: Snake Eater\nemerged after that, innovating the stealth genre yet\nagain. (see below)\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n25\nFriday 20 June 2008 felix\nArts\nMatt and Matt\u2019s\nLocated in the trendy Angel district, this little bar is quite easy to miss given the tens of other larger,\nmore commercial bars that swamp most London streets. Small it is but Matt and Matt\u2019s makes up\nfor it in a very chilled out, unpretentious atmosphere. Run by two old school mates, this hidden gem\nhas a slightly Cuban-esque and slightly \u2018worn\u2019 feel to the deco which only makes it all the more\ninviting and homely. The bar staff are friendly and always up for partying alongside you and often\nhappy to refund you a drink if you are unsatisfied, not that you will be, the cocktails as tasty as they\nare. This Friday the SleazyDJs return with their monthly night, but this time \u2018Sleazebox\u2019 is usurped by\na Burberry themed \u2018ChavBox\u2019. However, the music does not downgrade, with the SleazyDJs unleashing\ntheir usual infectious mix of house, breaks and sleazy electro. Adorn yourself with ganstaaah gold,\nhoop earrings, tracksuits tucked into socks, a gyro check for credibility and caps as you get to be\nworking class for the night without having to listen to a second\u2019s worth of garage. (No fighting please!)\nThis bar is open all nights apart from Sundays and Mondays and is also the perfect location to go\nto unwind for a few quiet ones and a great excuse to experience what the city has to offer in its more\nnorthern boroughs. Matt and Matt\u2019s only charges a small fee of 4GBP after midnight on certain nights.\nPublic Life, Shoreditch\nFor those of you who ARE partial to (drugged-up) dance music, then Public Life on Saturday\nafternoons might just be for you. This converted \u2018convenience\u2019-cum-underground bar is\nopen from the morning until midnight and is apparent only by a small glass awning and\nsteep flight of stairs taking you down into the depths of the club. Its secrecy means the hefty\nqueues and prices of a lot of West End water holes are avoided, and I am sure the majority\nof you will never have partied on down in a public toilet. The Lost Souls Techno Club\nopens its doors bright and early at 10.30am for the uber-keen or for those still carrying on\nfrom the night before. With some of the old Victorian tiling still on the walls and candles\neverywhere, the atmosphere created here is relax and friendly and with just about enough\nroom to thrown some shapes to the more underground sounds of break beats, \u2018electronica\u2019\nand minimal that emits from the speakers. The crowd here are chilled out which may differ\nfrom a lot of the pretentious folk who make up the East End/Shoreditch demographic. With\ncheap pub prices (the good old fashioned pubs) it will be a welcome relief from the rest of\nover-priced London, although beer and mixers pretty much makes up their drinks selection.\nTruly one of the most interesting and fun places to go for something totally different.\nCafe 1001\nNestled away in a private road just off Brick Lane, this coffee shop and DJ bar is truly one\nof its kind. I could barely contain my excitement upon taking in the extensive array of food\non offer: cakes, muffins, fresh juices, bagels, sandwiches, pizza, soups, pies, salads and\nhot meals. It took me at least fifteen minutes to decide on a very healthy-sized portion of\nchocolate cake and my discerning palette deemed it exceptional! They also prepare mouthwatering burgers outside the caf\u00e9 where there is also seating available in the form of wooden\ntables and benches. Caf\u00e9 1001 is open from 6am to midnight, with extended opening hours\non some nights. There is such a massive collection of music on offer here. Every Wednesday\nis their jazz night and each night of the week (and weekend) there are two rooms offering\neverything from blues, breaks, dubstep, DnB, techno, house, minimal, psy-trance and hip-hop. There are even film showings and yoga classes at scheduled times. The venue has high\nceilings and an airy feel to it with Moroccan style deco and very attractive murals on the\nwalls. Previous visitors include David Bowie and Liv Tyler but I can guarantee they won\u2019t be\nthere when you visit. The caf\u00e9 is currently supporting the Graduate Schools Art and Design\nshow, exhibiting in Brick Lane, should you feel the urge for some visual stimulation. I highly\nrecommend this venue which offers the chance to stuff your face with well-prepared, well-priced food and take in some aural delightment.\nThe Roxy Bar and Screen\nA trip to a characterless Odeon need no more be a part of your weekend once you have visited the Roxy screen in\nBorough. With a vibe more akin to a jazz club, it is laid back and sophisticated with ample table and chairs, booths\nand comfy sofas to enjoy the bar\u2019s extensive range of spirits and cocktails. Due to Greek ownership there is a special\nGreek food menu but if you steer clear of this and opt for the roasts you won\u2019t be disappointed. The drinks are\nreasonably priced and the Roxy is well able to cater for large groups at short notice. They show a good range of films,\nboth English language and european and also have Sunday documentaries, fundraising films, late night jazz and\n\u2018underground\u2019 films. At the moment, they are having screenings of Euro 2008 matches: an infinitely better way to\nenjoy the football than in a sweaty pub!\nWritten by Caz Knight, concept by Rosie Grayburn\n\n"

    "content": "music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFriday 20 June 2008 felix\nMusic\nOperator Please: coming to a Skins episode near you. They\u2019ve got it all \u2013 the\nlooks, the age, the strings, the synths\nand enough angst to fill up a special\nedition box set.\nBut hang on a moment, surely this\nis Be Your Own Pet in disguise? The\nfirst two tracks have the great riffs (See\n\u2018Zero Zero\u2019), the pointless lyrics, the\ntwo minute pop-punk tunes and that\nhas to be Jemina\u2019s voice. But apparently\nnot, this very young-looking pop-rock\nquintet hail from Queensland, Australia and can only pull off the \u2018rock\u2019 part\nfor half of their album \u2013 the poor kids\nprobably get tired.\nThird Australian single, but yet to be\nreleased in the UK, \u2018Just a Song About\nPing Pong\u2019 shows just how deceiving\nthese little blighters can be. I\u2019ll let you\ninto a secret, it\u2019s not about table tennis \u2013 THEY\u2019RE ACTUALLY SINGING ABOUT SEX! IN A SONG! The\ntune acts as a none-too-subtle meta-phor: repetitive, fast and it\u2019s all over in\ntwo minutes. I\u2019ve a good mind to tell\ntheir mothers, they still only look pre-pubescent.\nIt\u2019s quite a feat that vocalist Amandah Wilkinson can switch from sounding like Jemina from Be Your Own\nPet to Britney in just one album. \u201cYou\nmust think that I\u2019m weird,\u201d she nasally\ncroons in \u2018Two For My Seconds\u2019. Not\nweird, Amandah, insane. Especially to\nmake a repeat performance in \u20186/8\u2019.\nNormal service somehow manages\nto resume with \u2018Terminal Disease\u2019, the\nband now sounding like their other obvious idols, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The\nblatant rip-off aside, it\u2019s a short, dark\ngarage-rock ditty with \u2018Psycho\u2019-esque\nstrings, chesty vocals and some great\nbitty guitar work \u2013 a definite crowd-pleaser.\nWilkinson bitterly snarls her way\nthrough the title track. It will never\nmake a hit, but only in the same way\nthat BYOP and YYY\u2019s won\u2019t ever truly\nreach the mainstream. It\u2019s another\none of the better songs on the album\neven though, like the entire handful of\ngood tracks, it could have been ripped\nstraight from \u2018Get Awkward\u2019 or \u2018Fever\nto Tell\u2019. Even with this in mind, the\nAustralian press seem to love them and\nthis Gold Coast band has got one hell\nof a fan base.\n\u2018Leave It Alone\u2019 is another stand-out\ntrack on the album. The chorus is far\ntoo catchy, making it great fodder for\na radio hit. The tight drums even make\nthe string section seem less oppres-sive. However, even on this track, the\nenergy the band produce live seems\nto be compressed when recorded. The\nrecord has an overwhelming sense of\nbeing half-asleep.\nYou can\u2019t blame Operator Please for\ntrying (except for the Britney songs,\nthere\u2019s no sympathy there), there\u2019s a\nbit of everything in this album. They\ngo from the punk dancefloor fillers\nlike \u2018Ghost\u2019 and \u2018Get What You Want\u2019\nto acoustic. Stripped-down \u2018Other\nSong\u2019 is a suitable name for this non-electric number, although I would have\npreferred \u2018Shouldn\u2019t Have Been on\nthe Album\u2019 or \u2018B-Side to a B-Side\u2019 or\n\u2018Only Kidding Folks, We Weren\u2019t Really Thinking of Recording This\u2019. The\ntrack\u2019s only use on the album is to exercise your finger by pressing the skip\nbutton.\nThe album closer has a fitting name;\nwith their countless influences and\nsound-alikes, this album should be\nthe equivalent of seeing a star-studded\nWest End Show, only it\u2019s more like going to a Bognor Regis \u2018Pantomime\u2019 (Ti-tle of track twelve and another sodding\nBritney number!) with Dean Gaffney\n(Oh no it isn\u2019t! Oh yes it is!).\nThere\u2019s definitely some potential in\nthis album. The ability of the musicians\ncan\u2019t be faulted and there are at least\nfour good tracks. Operator Please were\nOperator Please\nYes Yes Vindictive\nVirgin/EMI\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nQueensland\u2019s answer to McFly \u2013 oh please...\ndiscovered overwhelmingly fast after\nforming to win their school\u2019s battle of\nthe bands competition and the LP almost hints they were forced to make\nthe album in a hurry. The composition\nseems rushed and any essences of punk\nrock have been overproduced. What\nthey lack is believability and urgency.\nAt the moment, Operator Please just\nreek of bubblegum-flavoured teenage\nangst.\nLara O\u2019Reilly\nRanging in ages from 17 to 19, Operator Please are all perfectly legal\nEven a boy who looks like a girl \u2013 job\u2019s a good\u2018un!\nTerrorvision were never going to provide an intellectual challenge on Saturday night, but then again there wasn\u2019t\nanyone there looking for one.\nTheybecame(moderately)famouson\nthe back of 3-minute party rock songs\nand even though it\u2019s been ten years\nsince they\u2019ve done anything you\u2019ll have\nheard of, it seemed that everybody in\nthe crowd was there to help them sing.\nThat\u2019s okay though, because the average age in the crowd was closer\nto forty than anyone would care\nto admit, so the whole place had\nan atmosphere more like a college reunion gig than anything\nelse. Or perhaps an incipient\nmid-life crisis. The front-man,\nTony Wright (coincidentally\nforty this year), certainly wasn\u2019t\nholding too much back, jumping around like a Northern\nIggy Pop \u2013 he had far more\ngas than I did for most of\nthe set for sure, but maybe\nbecause of it he had to\ntake a breather during the\nencore.\nThat, more than anything else,\ndragged the level of the gig down to\nthe mediocre \u2013 while there was little\ndanger of the band playing a bunch\nof new songs, their limited back-cata-logue was painfully obvious when they\nstarted repeating songs in the encore as\nacoustic versions. That\u2019s right, acoustic jump-around party rock. Acoustic\n\u2018Tequila\u2019, a song that\u2019s only any good\nat all if you can leap around the place\nthrowing your beer everywhere and\ndon\u2019t listen to the lyrics too hard. I\u2019m\nnot a big fan of routine encores anyway\n\u2013 they\u2019re supposed to be something\nyou earn, not something written\ninto the programme \u2013 but playing an electrifying one hour set\nfollowed by a dreary half-hour\nencore left everyone feeling\nlike it had been a bit of an\nanti-climax.\nIncidentally, when did the\nEmpire get all staid and sen-sible? I know the smoking\nban isn\u2019t the organisers\u2019\nfault, but on top of that\nthe fun police have begun to take a hard line on\ncrowd-surfing, and seemed\nto have channelled about half\nthe venue\u2019s power into ridiculously macho air-con. That\nin itself isn\u2019t a bad thing, but\nall the power seemed to have come\nfrom the speakers, so you could comfortably chat to your mates throughout\nthe set, even from the sixth-ish row\nwhere I was. Not very fucking rock\nand roll, is it? Or maybe I\u2019m just harking back to the good old days myself\u2026\nDuncan Casey\nTerrorvision also at\nShepherds Bush Empire\nthe songs are formulaic and all sound\npractically the same, but this energetic,\nBeach Boys-esque formula works for\nme and for thousands of girls all over\nthe country.\nAs a front-man Roy Stride gives it\nhis all \u2013 bouncing around on stage,\njumping into the crowd \u2013 the\nworks. You suspect he might be\na bit of a prick in real life, but\nhe knows his audience. I\nfound his Panto-style\n\u201cWho can shout the\nlyrics the loudest?\u201d\ncontests cringe-worthy, but it\nworked for the\nmajority.\nHighlights\nincluded a\ncute little\nsong about\nJames Bond\nand even one\nabout MySpace \u2013\nideally suited to their fans. The\nset ended with \u2018Elvis Isn\u2019t Dead\u2019, in my\nopinion their finest (and catchiest) of-fering. \u2018She\u2019s So Lovely\u2019 was the obvious\nencore and after a bit of \u201clast night in\nour home town\u201d stuff they departed.\nIt was the perfect gig for forgetting\nall about exams and just pretending to\nbe thirteen again. I didn\u2019t get to kiss\nthem, but going off that performance I\ndefinitely still would.\nChristina Flanagan\nI am probably too old to go to a Scouting for Girls gig \u2013 I\u2019d like to think I had\nbetter musical taste. And yet nothing\ncould have stopped me turning up at\nShepherds Bush Empire a few weeks\nago, grinning like a mad person.\nMy first chance to see the sugar-sweet trio was more than two years\nago in early 2006. Two musically \u2018with-it\u2019 school friends\ninsisted I come along to\nsome basement in Manchester to see a new\nindie-pop band. To\nmy lasting regret I declined due to a French\nexam the next morn-ing. Apparently about\nten people showed up\nand my friends managed to get off with\ncertain band-members.\nA Scouting for Girls badge and\na French AS-level were small consolation as the band started to get more\nand more airplay and my friends smugger and smugger.\nMyincredibly unselfish boyfriend decided to\nstop my\nwhining\nwith a\npair of tickets\nto the final London\ndate of their tour.\nOnly slightly disconcerted by the huge\ncrowds of giggling girls outside (all\nunder sixteen), we made our way in to\ndiscover we weren\u2019t quite the oldest in\nthe venue \u2013 there were three drunken\nmiddle-aged women and one of\nthe girls had brought\nher dad.\nTwo support acts were\nneeded as Scouting for Girls have\nstill have precious little material. We missed\nthem both, which was\na shame as I now keep\nhearing Go:Audio on the\nradio all the time.\nAbout 10.30pm Roy Stride,\nPeter Elland and Greg Churchhouse finally made it on stage.\nThere was a great deal of screaming\nand I must admit I joined in. Scouting\nfor Girls make happy music for happy\npeople and I like to think I\u2019m pretty\nupbeat. Even the most teen angst-ridden of their lyrics (\u201cI\u2019m not over\nyou\u201d, \u201cthese dreams are killing me\u201d) are\nrescued by relentlessly cheery melo-dies. The lyr- ics are incredibly\neasy to pick up\nand sing along\nto and the music is perfect\nfor those indulging in post-revision dancing in\nthe kitchen (just me?). I completely\nagree with those who complain that\nScouting For Girls at Shepherds Bush Empire\n\n"

But\nbefore we go, here\u2019s a re-cap of the major, and some not so major, stories that have occupied this year\u2019s Felix\nT\nhe year began with Southside\nopening its doors on time, albeit with rooms yet to be fully\ncompleted. Furniture remained un-packed; items and fittings were still\nboxed; builders\u2019 tools were found\nlying in bedrooms; and lifts were\nmalfunctioning amongst a plethora\nof other problems.\nCollege recognised this as unacceptable and offered a 25% discount\non rent to affected students, but only\nfor their first month. Students lucky\nenough to find themselves with a\nview of the Eastside builders\u2019 porta-cabins were offered a further \u00a35 per\nweek discount for the entire year.\nMany students were left outraged at\nhaving to pay over \u00a3155.00 per week\nfor unfinished accommodation. Despite the initial criticisms, the halls\nwere still incomplete nine weeks later.\nstoictv revealed Southside was still in a\nshambolic state when it filmed on location for its current affairs programme,\nexposing unattached toilet seats, flooding showers and door fixtures that fell\noff when used.\nThe rise of Imperial and\nthe decline in satisfaction\nSouthside opens unfinished\nI\nmperial leapt from ninth to fifth\nplace in the Times Higher Education Survey in 2007, trailing\nbehind Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford\nand Yale. However, the rise came\nonly months after findings from the\n2008 Good University Guide statistics which placed Imperial at 68th in\nthe student satisfaction rankings.\nIn December Felix set out to discuss university satisfaction with\nImperial\u2019s student body. Responses\nwere mixed: some students were\ncritical of the recreational facilities\noffered at IC and also complained\naboutfeelingstressed,butmanywere\npleased with their university experience stating that they wouldn\u2019t have\nchosen anywhere else in hindsight.\nOne thing that everyone could\nagree upon is that students at Imperial are worked very hard!\nAutumn term: October \u2013 December\nI\nn response to a number of\nthefts from the Aeronautics\ndepartment, Felix decided to\ninvestigate the building\u2019s security.\nTurnstiles were installed across\ncampus over the summer break,\nreplacing the security guards that\npreviously manned the entrances.\nFelix tested their effectiveness using a number of methods such as\nvaulting over the barriers, crawling underneath them and even\ndoing the \u2018limbo.\u2019\nDespite doing this in full view of\na CCTV camera, and after waiting for over an hour for a security\nguard to show up, Felix got bored\nand left the scene, free to prowl\nwhere it likes.\nT\nhe character of Imperial\nstudents was brought into\nquestion on two separate occasions in the Autumn term, when\nFelix received several complaints\nabout instances of questionable\nbehaviour.\nIn November, Felix received a letter from an offended visitor to the\nCollege, appalled at students\u2019 lack\nof consideration shown for their\nsurroundings. The arrival of the letter coincided with the annual Royal\nSchool of Mines Freshers\u2019 Dinner\na.k.a. \u2018The Most Notorious Night\nof the Year,\u2019 at which the RSM were\nfined for damages and forced to\napologise after numerous damages,\na food fight, copious amounts of\nvomit and a glass full of urine being\nleft for cleaners.\nImperial students\u2019 lack of respect\nwas brought into question once\nagain towards the end of November\nwhen members of the Football Club\nwere alleged to have chanted homophobic phrases in the Union.\nImperial students\u2019\nquestionable behaviour\nTesting The Ring of Steel\nAnd in\nother\nnews...\nStudent news website Live!\n(live.cgcu.net) scooped the\nBest Student Website Award\nat the 2007 Guardian Student\nMedia Awards\nPM Gordon Brown visited\ncampus to show his support\nfor the newly created IC\nHealthcare NHS Trust\nUnion Councillors were\nwoken from their collective\nslumber with sudden\nalarm when GSA Chair,\nJon Matthews resigned in\ndramatic style by storming\nout of the Upper Dining Hall,\navoiding a censure\nNUS reforms passed at\nDecember\u2019s Extraordinary\nconference. Failure to have the\npolicies ratified the following\nyear ultimately led to the latest\nNUS referendum\n\u201cHere, sir!\u201d: Registration\nfor overseas students?\nHigher\nEducation\ndebate\nre-opens\nW\nith the 2009 Top-up\nFees review edging\ncloser and closer, ICU\ntook steps to revise its stance on\nthe Higher Education funding\ndebate.\nAfter months of debate, policy\nrevisions and a survey of the student body, the Union eventually formulated its new policy in\nMarch 2008.\nThe new policy, formed on the\nbasis of the opinions of 440 IC stu-dents, resolved to support keeping\nTop-up Fees at \u00a33,000; to oppose\nan increase in the cap; to oppose\nmarketisation of Higher Education; and to oppose Graduate Tax.\nI\nn November Felix reported on\nthe government\u2019s plans to introduce a draconian monitoring\nsystem to keep tabs on the number\nof days overseas students are absent\nfor from their courses.\nAccording to Tier 4 of the Home\nOffice\u2019s \u201cPoint Based System,\u201d which\nis due to become active in early 2009,\noverseas students who are absent for\nmore than 14 days must be reported\nto the government.

    "content": "felix@imperial.ac.uk Travel\n35\nFriday 20 June 2008 felix\ngeous, extortionate tips out of me. As\nI was travelling alone they tried to exercise greater power over me but I did\nnot give in and phoned the boss of the\ncompany as soon as I could, who called\nthem off. Having to deal with this\nwhen no help was available to me was\na really unpleasant experience and in\nhindsight, my advice would be to clear\nthis prevalent issue with the company\nbefore starting out.\nAnyway, as we got to the third day\nof the climb, things started to become\nchallenging. I could feel the air getting\nthinner and I became out of breath a lot\nmore easily. The guide was cooking me\nfood that was bland and unappetising\nso I also gave up on eating. The temperature was very low and the biting\nwind and cold necessitated a balaclava.\nAll in all, I was feeling tired, alone and\ndisheartened.\nThe distance that we had to cover\nevery day was very long and slowly\nI toiled my way to the day before the\nsummit attempt. However, that night\nwe were only to sleep for four hours\nbefore starting at midnight for the final\npush to the top. At this point, the altitude sickness had kicked in properly\nand my head and vision seemed to be\nphysically pulsating with a throbbing\nheadache, the worst I have ever had.\nThe altitude now was 5000m and I\nwas to climb the remaining 1000m or\nso over the next half a day. We were\nscheduled to arrive at the summit in\nthe early morning before the sun\u2019s heat\nhad a chance to generate cloud from\nthe evaporation of the snow and ice at\nthe peak, as it did on a daily basis.\nWaking up for the final climb at midnight was a real struggle and I was immediately out of breath upon waking\nbut obviously I felt that I could not give\nup having gotten this far. A full moon\nwas out and I could see the flashlights\nof a few climbers who had set out before us winding up the mountainside\nahead of me. We made a decision to be\nslow but steady.\nAs we proceeded at the frustratingly\nunhurried pace, some of the more eager climbers were retreating past us,\ndescending to prevent serious altitude\nsickness. My guide assured me I would\nnot get this if we stuck to our strategy\nand I put my trust in his experience.\nAs we climbed, the stunning view\nbecame much better and I could make\nout the coast, Zanzibar Island, road\nnetworks, Arusha, Moshi, Daar-esSalaam and the vast plains of Tanzania, all lit up under the light of the full\nmoon. Yet the effects of altitude sickness continuously became poorer and\nmy stamina, vision and headache were\nall worsening. Stupid determination\nwould still not let me stop or retreat\nthough.\nAn arduous few hours later, we were\nvery close to the end and the sun rose\nover a blanket of clouds below us. To\nthis orange backdrop we arrived at the\npeaks at the top of Kili that were surrounding a very wide crater. The tallest\nof these was Uhuru Peak and was snow\ncapped, littered with melting glaciers.\nThis was the one we set off on but at\nthis point though, something odd hap-pened. I appeared to lose my mind.\nI started hearing my mum and sister\u2019s\nvoices calling to me! I remember a moment of grave uncertainty and irrationality hitting me as I had to sluggishly\nreact and make certain that they had\nnot been travelling with me all along\nand that I was alive and awake. I then\nbizarrely proceeded to call my guide\n\u201cSam\u201d then \u201cSimon\u201d before finally pinning his real name \u201cMax\u201d down, using\ngreat intellectual energy and concen-tration. Beyond this, I cannot remember much of what happened but I made\nit to the summit where Max got someone else to take a photo of us as proof\nbut apparently I was sporadically walking around in circles while insisting on\nlying flat on my back at other times.\nThis was pretty bad altitude sickness\nand any intelligent person would have\nchosen to swallow their pride and descend to avoid risking their brain. But\nI had to be different, as always. I really\ncannot recommend enough adding an\nextra day to the itinerary for acclimati-sation regardless of the extra cost and\nit is regrettable that I did not have the\npatience for it. When I regained my\nsenses and memory, we were on our\nway down again. This was a real joy as\nfirstly, it was a lot quicker, and second-ly, the more I went down, the more my\nheadache lessened!\nI was in such a rush to get away from\nthe mountain by now that I forced the\nentire team to trek all the way back to\nthe exit of the park, and then to take\nlate night buses to Arusha via Moshi\non the same day as summitting. Thus,\nwe completed the 6 day Machame\nroute in 5 days.\nEssential Experience 2 \u2013 Safari in\nthe Maasai Mara\nGoing on safari is another one of those\n\u2018tick the box\u2019 things anyone who visits Africa must do. In the time I spent\nthere, I went to many different safari\nparks including famous ones such as\nNgorogoro crater, Amboseli and Lake\nNkuru but the one I recommend above\nall others is the Maasai Mara. It consists of a smoothly carved hilly landscape and a sea of waving golden grass,\ndotted with eccentric but picturesque\nlone trees. I would go as far as to say\nthat it is the only park visitors need to\nsee when considering Safaris in East\nAfrica as it really is the best one.\nOne of the reasons it is so great is that\nthe authorities let you get closer to the\nanimals here than anywhere else. This\nis really good for watching animals\nand photography but as with all good\nthings, it comes attached with an ethical cost of heavy erosion to the animal\nhabitat and at the cost of disturbing\nanimal behaviour. I cannot justify or\ncondone this for mine or anyone else\u2019s\namusement but the authorities appear\nto manage this well, shutting down areas they think are too heavily damaged\nto allow recovery and the drivers appear to co-operate with these rules.\nBut on the other hand I saw some\ndrivers in the Maasai Mara, especially\nthose in large overland buses, (that\nI would advise EVERYONE to steer\nclear of \u2013 the worst imaginable way to\nsee Africa), who would really pester\nanimals and disturb vital behaviour\nsuch as hunting. This was inexcusable.\nFurther unpleasantness was caused\nby assertive Maasai tribesmen. Being the indigenous people here, their\n\u2018culture\u2019 is somewhat of a tacky tourist\nexploit that has evolved into a forceful\ndisplay of anger towards anyone who\ntakes their photo and does not pay\nthem for it, or anyone who does not\nbuy their shabby \u2018cultural\u2019 wares or entertain their pricy \u2018cultural exhibitions\u2019.\nWith a little precaution and sensibility,\nthis can be avoided altogether.\nLooking past all the above, though,\nNearly at the top... ! Just before altitude sickness got the best of me\nA team of adventurers power on ahead of us\nThe lonely but picturesque trees A giraffe. In case you couldn\u2019t tell\n\n"

So the year\u2019s finally\nover and what a rollercoaster ride it\u2019s been! Things got\nso hectic with the Summer\nTerm that I had take a proper hiatus from the section altogether. I\noffer my apologies to the readers and\nto anyone who enjoyed going through\nthe Games pages.\nIt\u2019s only appropriate that this last issue under the stewardship of Tomo\ngets to have the Games section dedicated to the one and only Metal Gear\nSolid 4: Guns of the Patriots. The game\nrepresents the end of an era that has\nleft a permanent mark on the world\nof videogames and one whose praises\nshall be sung everywhere. While smok-ing. And taking down giant bipedal\nmachines of mass destruction.\nNormally, this editorial section is the\nhardest bit to write but the irony now\nis that there\u2019s so much to be said yet so\nlittle space to say it in. However, there\u2019s\nno harm in trying.\nFrom a gaming perspective, the\n2007-08 session has been a pretty\namazing one, witnessing the release of\na cavalcade of games that simply blow\neverything out of the water. There\nare too many names to list but you all\nknow who these lovely chaps are any-way. Who knows what the 2008-09 session will bring us, but there are some\npleasant surprises and true gems in\nthe horizon. But enough about games,\nthere are more important things to be\nsaid here!\nFirstly, it\u2019s been absolutely amazing\nto work for Felix this year and I can\u2019t\nthank Tomo enough for his encourage-ment, guidance, patience and the Thai\nnoodles he\u2019d get from Tesco. Running\nthe Games section has been crazy (in\na good way) and I\u2019m really glad that so\nmany of you, the readers, responded\nso positively to it. I mean, seriously, it\nreally makes all that hard work utterly,\nutterly worth it in the end. So a really\nbig round of thanks goes out to all of\nthe readers for their comments, and to\nEdu and Dave of the IC Gaming Club\nas well as the members.\nPersonal thanks and lotsa love go out\nto all the lovely people who contributed\nto Felix Games: Alex Stubley, Andrew\nLim, Andrew Lyle, Andrew Somerville,\nAngry Geek, Chris Hutchison, David\nLawrence, Derek Chow, James Finnerty, James Porter, Jen Strangeways, Mike\nCook, Robin George Andrews, fellow\nEditor Sebastian Nordgren, Tom Roberts, Viral Shah and Wing Hym Liu. If\nthere\u2019s any other name that I haven\u2019t\nmentioned then I offer my deepest\napologies. You may send Howlers to\nthe usual address at games.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk.\nA big round of hugs are there for the\nFelix team this year who were a bunch\nof awesome people, both professionally and personally. I hope all of you guys\ncontinue at Felix!\nHere\u2019s hoping to a fantastic new version of Felix next year under the leadership of one Jovan \u201cJov\u201d Nedic and I\nhope that Felix Games can take over\nthe entire paper, erm, continues to be\nread and loved by all.\nSolid Snake, Legendary\nAzfarul Islam witnesses the end of an era that helped change gaming\nI\nt has be confessed that I approached this article with a\ngreat deal of trepidation. On\none hand, I love the Metal Gear\nSolid series which means that\nbias could easily creep into the text.\nSimilarly, the last time I played an MGS\ngame was roughly four years ago with\nthe third iteration. I was worried that a\ncombination of time and having been\nexposed to the multitude of incredible\ngames in between may cause me to\nlook at the slightly sillier aspects of the\nseries with distaste. And on top of that,\nthe expectations levelled on this game\nwere astronomical. Just for starters.\nHowever, all this mattered little once\nthe ending credits rolled on buoyed by\nsoothing versions of the main orchestral themes of Metal Gear\u2019s past.\nMetal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots sees you plunged into a world\nwhere war and conflict are routine;\nthey have transformed from something\nabhorrentintoa\nfull-fledged\neconomy.\nPrivate\nMilitary\nCompanies or PMCs have become the\ncorporations of this dystopian future;\nchildren now grow up wanting to fight\ntoearnincome.Rebelfactionsthrough-out the world offer the resistive forces\nthe PMCs need to keep themselves in\nbusiness. On top of this is an underlying system centred on nanomachine\ntechnology that keeps everything in\ncheck. Certainly, the very concept of\nwar has changed. It\u2019s into one of these\nmany battles that the series\u2019 hero Solid\nSnake is inserted. However, something\nis amiss.\nThe man is prone to fits of coughing and seizures. His hardened arteries\npump the remnants of the deadly virus\nFOXDIE. His weary muscles ache and\nneed to be supported by an enhancing\nbody suit. And his greyed hair reveals a\nshocking change from the legend we\u2019ve\nall come to know and love. This is no\nlonger the story we\u2019ve come to expect;\nthis is the story of Old Snake.\nSneaking in amidst a convoy of freedom fighters, Snake is on a very different mission to his makeshift comrades.\nThey seek to fight whereas he seeks to\nend it all. Under fire from the well-po-sitioned PMC troops, Snake is forced\nto leave the vehicle and continue on\nfoot. And this is where you come in.\nThe cinematic camera follows Snake\nas he ducks behind cover\nand ever so\nsubtly,\ncontrol is\ngivento\nthe player. This is only where the game\njust begins to shine.\nOne of the first things that series\u2019\nveterans will notice is that their well-worn control niches don\u2019t give you the\nreactions they would expect. A few\ntaps here, perhaps following by a lasting depression or two, reveals that even\nthe controls have finally embraced a\nmore streamlined generation as with\nmost current titles. The tiniest hint of\ndisappointment at change slowly transitions to wonder as Snake\u2019s moveset\nslowly showcases a gleefully large variety of motions and smooth, intuitive\nmachinations.\nNow content, your intense focus on\nthe controller shifts and suddenly the\nmuffled sound created by your own\ndistraction comes into sharp focus. Soldiers yell indiscriminately and guns rat-tle, all in the name of the war economy,\nand you can even pick the combatants\ngive each other orders, encouragement\nand shout for help. Suddenly, you feel\nSnake\u2019s age set in. And it\u2019s not because\nhe\u2019s just reached to rub his aching\nlower back. The conflict has escalated\nfrom the few-on-one encounters of the\npast and has taken a mind of its own;\nwhether or not you wish to be part of\nthe madness will always depend on you\nas the game progresses. It\u2019s a bloody\nbattlefield out there, but you can\u2019t help\nbut be awestruck at this assault on the\nsenses. And you know what? Squint at\nit just a bit. No, really do it. See that?\nThat won\u2019t be the first time your jaw\ndrops and bounces down the stairs and\nrolls onto the road outside.\nSeriously speaking,\nI\u2019ve come to accept\ngenerally sharp and\nshiny visuals to\nbe the norm for\nthis generation;\nit\u2019s only fair\nfor the high\ncost investment that all parties involved are mak-ing. However, I would be an utter fool\nto not admit that Metal Gear Solid 4\nmade me speechless on more than one\noccasion. There were moments when\nyou can\u2019t help but ask yourself: \u201cSurely\nthat was real? Surely that wasn\u2019t realtime?\u201d Yeah, there are some pretty ugly\ntextures scattered around that disappoint but as for everything framing\nthese bits, well, the comparison seems\nastronomical.\nSpread over five acts, Metal Gear\nSolid 4 sends Solid Snake and his\nfriends, new and old, travelling across\nthe world with one goal in mind: to\nstop the freakish amalgamation of\nformer personalities Liquid Snake and\nRevolver Ocelot. Alone they were far\nmore formidable than most villains but\nas one being their sheer aura exudes\nsomething that\u2019s rather holistic, in a\ndeliciously evil way. This is a plot that\nis a true culmination of everything that\nmakes Metal Gear the benchmark for\ninteractive storytelling. There are characters you genuinely feel for, events that\nastound and come shockingly close to\nreal life and plot twists that build their\nway into grand schemes which inspire\nboth awe and fear. There\u2019s a significant\nimprovement in the quality of the writing and dialogue as well. Still as emotive and heartfelt, the hamfisted nature\nof past titles have been toned down by\na large degree.\nAnd what a set of acts this was.\nFighting through dust-choked battlefields where the conflict between\nfinance and freedom never ends. Entering the jungles once again to use\nthe land itself in your favour. Bedecked\nin a stylish trenchcoat, tailing a man\nthrough a city under curfew and where\nfrequent patrols threaten to send you\nto the chopping block. And then, going\nback to where it all began...\nNow, I was always expecting the tale\nto be of epic proportions, as with any\n\n"

Nick Robinson gave his readers ten reasons why it was a nightmare\nfor the Conservatives. Herein lies the\ninterest of this story, not the desire of\none man to invoke debate on an argument that has already left harbour (ha-beas corpus was not eroded by the 42\nday detention bill, it already lay in ruins with the introduction of detention\nwithout charge in principle). The real\ninterest is the transformation of the\nConservative party from ineffective\nopposition to government in waiting.\nGordon Brown cannot win the next\ngeneral election, short of David Cameron revealing that he has a \u00a3500 a\nday cocaine habit, and so we are left to\nconsider politics in Britain after 2010.\nA small win, one would hope, would\nencourage debate on legislation as\neach bill is fought through parliament\nbut more likely would slow the work of\ngovernment. In any case, the UK is due\na large swing towards the Conservatives in a victory similar to Labour\u2019s in\n1997. The citizens of the UK are disillusioned with Labour and are prepared\nto give the Conservatives a resounding\nmandate to take them in a new direc-tion. This country faces many challeng-es, global and domestic but challenges\nare nothing more than opportunities\nto excel and this is the weight that lies\nupon Conservative shoulders. Without\nfresh, bold and innovative ideas, David\nCameron will be little else than No\n10\u2019s house-sitter when what the public\nyearn for is a strong man to lead them.\nIt might be a step too far if I were to\nmirror David Cameron with Barack\nObama, however there are similarities\nbetween these charismatic politicians.\nObama too faces the great weight of\ndelivering a product that will satisfy\nthe expectations that he has raised. In\nfact while David Cameron\u2019s electoral\nhopes rest on the failures of the Labour\nparty and his speech giving abilities,\nObama campaigns on his promise to\n\u201cbring about real change in Washington\u201d. And many believe him, the Senator for Illinois is almost deified by his\nsupporters; one can only imagine the\nexperience of stepping out on a stage\nas people faint in the front row and the\ncrowd chants your name.\nWe have seen in the past that leaders\nwith great potential, either squander or\nmisuse it. The most recent example is\nof French President Sarkozy who failed\nto deliver his promise to revitialize the\nFrench economy. The fate of the U.S.\nand the U.K. has become ever more\nentwined in the last 7 years. We have\nthe same terrorist threats, the same\nmilitary strains and the same economic difficulties. We also both have\nthe opportunity to solve these problems under a new government. David\nCameron and Barack Obama might do\nwell to remember, if they should gain\noffice, that it is neither change nor unfamiliar ideas that the public resent.\nRather it is a lack of conviction, a willingness to be commanded by the ebb\nand flow of political fortunes than by\nones belief in what is right and a failure\nto provide and deliver a vision for the\nfuture of the country that brings down\ngovernments.\nThere is little else for me to do except\nre-iterate my plea to these two men in\na less subtle manner. You need to deliver the great change and progress that\nthe people of the U.K. and the U.S. de-mand. Without imagination and cour-age, both David Cameron and Barack\nObama will primarily achieve little else\nthan to further the political apathy of\nthe public.\nGilead Amit\nThe Humour-n Race\nfelix\nRelinquishing the mighty organ\nO\nur vision of early humanity consists of a\nsea of almost unending idiocy. Bewildered\ncavemen wandering off\nthe edges of cliffs while their delightful cavewoman spouses were being hit\nover the head with clubs and dragged\nbehind bushes for a spot of light evolu-tion. The only glimmer of intelligence\nwe expect to find comes from the\nbright sparks who burnt themselves\non the first fires, cut themselves on the\nfirst flints, and ran down hills chasing\nafter the first wheels. The emphasis we\nplace on these three milestones has led\nus to see these three individual Neanderthals as vastly different from their\ncontemporary hirsute halfwits. They\nmight as well have sauntered around\nin bowler hats and smoking jackets,\nsneering contemptuously from the refined solitude of their pentcaves with a\nsnifter of cognac in one hand and the\nworks of Rousseau in the other.\nThe reason we place so much emphasis on these three; to whom, for the\nsake of simplicity, I shall refer as Groucho, Chico and Harpo, is that they conclusively and irrevocably distinguished\nus from the other animals. Groucho\u2019s\nability with fire was unmatched in the\nearly Pleistocene, and his weekly shows\nat the London Palladium (known in the\nearly days as pile-of-mud-next-to-tree-where-red-bird-go-tweet) were avidly\nattended. Chico\u2019s flints were the sharpest and most accurate of his time, and\nindeed the whole range of Chico\u2019s Cutlery Supplies was advertised virtually\ncontinuously on the Caveman Shopping Channel. Unlike his two illustrious companions, however, Harpo\u2019s\nreputation was only guaranteed after\nhis death; a tragic accident at the wheel\nof his 1x1 Range Rover.\nAs worthy of recognition as Groucho, Chico and Harpo may be, there is\na fourth early hominid whose superior\ncontribution has been sadly overlooked\nby history. We know nothing of Zeppo;\none of those unfortunate cases all too\ncommon in the sad story of inventors.\nI refer, of course, to the author of the\nworld\u2019s very first joke.\nLet me clarify: by \u2018joke\u2019 I do not mean\nprimitive examples of slapstick, early\ncave-dwellers finding mammoth dung\nintrinsically amusing, or the discovery\nthat hitting somebody else can tickle\none\u2019s funny bone. I mean the first real\njoke \u2013 complete with the holy trinity of\npremise, context and punch-line.\nWhenever and wherever it took\nplace, the moment that joke was delivered marks one of the definitive turning points in our evolution. Because\nthis is what really, fundamentally, distinguishes us as humans. Hyenas would\nmake lousy stand-up acts, chickens\ndon\u2019t care about our jaywalking activi-ties, and the witty banter engaged in by\ndolphins is highly overrated.\nWithout a sense of humour, we\u2019re\nnothing. The ability to laugh and make\nothers laugh is what makes life worth-while, and a sense of irony is our best\nway of living with the terrifying, bewildering and awe-inspiring universe we\ninhabit. Intentionally making someone\nelse laugh is inseparable from an understanding of human interactions. Can I\nmake a joke about someone else\u2019s dead\ngrandmother? Or is it too soon? Will\nthe scatology be acceptable for an af-ter-dinner speech, or is that something\nI should keep for my similarly-minded\nfriends? Can I make Holocaust jokes if\nI\u2019m not Jewish? Does the presence of\na minority member in the conversation entitle the group to be hideously\nun-PC? For those people we label as\n\u2018funny\u2019, the answers are so obvious that\nthe questions are hardly worth consid-ering. The boundaries of humour are\namong the most fragile we have (apart\nfrom those existing in the Balkans. Too\nsoon?), as a second\u2019s delay in timing or\nan accidentally misplaced stress can\nconvert an off-the-cuff witticism into a\ndeeply wounding and potentially libellous remark. A sense of humour acts as\nan almost infallible compass in these\nsituations, allowing one to stay on the\nsafe side of the precipice, though occasionally venturing dangerously close to\nthe edge.\nThis is why we find the concept of\nartificial intelligence such a worrying one \u2013 the fact that computers and\nrobots are so completely humourless.\nCan you imagine Clippy \u2013 the once\nubiquitous but now, thanks to recent\nculling programmes, almost extinct,\nMS Word paperclip \u2013 exchanging\nwitty repartee with the Help icon? Saying: \u2018it looks like you are trying to kill\nyourself, would you like me to a) cheer\nyou up, b) sing a happy song or c) help\nyou to write a letter?\u2019 Unthinkable. If\nit could, it would be unimaginably less\nirritating. And would probably still be\naround today. Alas.\nThere is a phenomenon known as\nthe \u2018uncanny valley\u2019, a reference to the\ndiscomfort humans experience around\nrobots that eerily resemble us. I am\nconvinced that a robot with a sense of\nhumour would be able to bridge the\nvalley, as it would, by definition, be\nable to understand and relate to the\nfull gamut of human emotions. Show\nme a robot with a genuinely creative\nsense of humour, able to adapt itself\nto situations and feel its way round an\naudience, and the other obstacles to\ngranting it sentience will melt away.\nCall it the Amit test for true artificial\nintelligence. Don\u2019t worry, my modesty\ncan take the blow.\nModern humans are almost unrec-ognizably different from our earliest\nancestors, but that very first joke links\nus more strongly to Cro-Magnon or\nHomo Erectus than any technological or biological similarities. Of all the\nstages in human evolution, the Irony\nAge has been the most important.\nT\nhis is literally the last thing\nI\u2019ll be writing for Felix this\nyear, that is unless Gilead\nand Andrew don\u2019t finish\nup soon or I may find myself publishing a couple of fake suicide\nnotes...\nEr, it\u2019s been a long week, OK? Back off.\nIn fact, it\u2019s been a pretty long year. I\u2019ve\nthoroughly enjoyed my time as the Felix\nDictator but I can\u2019t actually remember\nthe last time I slept more than 3 hours\non a Wednesday night, so I\u2019m certainly\nhappy to be finally calling it a day.\nYet despite my vision growing drastically worse, my hairs turning gray\nand my skin developing a thin film\nof sticky moisture thanks to the stifling dungeon ecosystem I inhabit for\nmost of the week, I wouldn\u2019t change\nthe way Felix is for the world. There\u2019s\nsomething immensely satisfying about\nslaving through the long nights in the\nknowledge that what you\u2019re producing will bring a smile and enjoyment\nto thousands of people each week.\nEssentially, it\u2019s been a case of making\nthe most of the opportunity I\u2019ve been\nhanded. It would have been easy to\nsit back and churn out samey issues,\nweek-in-week-out, but I feel that myself and the team have worked hard to\nkeep the newspaper fresh every time;\nsomething I\u2019m particularly proud of.\nI\u2019ve spent the last 3 years working for\nthe newspaper, during the last two of\nwhich the leather seats have perfectly\nmolded to my arse cheeks. I\u2019ve grown\nphysically attached to this place and\nmost definitely emotionally attached\nto the people with whom I\u2019ve had the\npleasure of working.\nWithout all of the beautiful people\nlisted on the centrefold of this issue,\nFelix wouldn\u2019t exist, so I would like to\nthank them all for their tireless work\nthis year too. There has been such an\nawesome spirit in the office this year\nand it has really made this job very en-joyable. You guys are the greatest and\nI\u2019m definitely not going to forget this\nyear. I would say I\u2019m going to miss you\nall, but I\u2019m going to be back next year\nto annoy Jov with the rest of you any-way! Till then guys, have a great sum-mer, it\u2019s been emotional.\n\n"

It brought NBC so\nmuch money that by season\nnine the main actors were\npaid $600,000 per 20min episode.\nApart from making millions of fans\nacross the globe laugh weekly for nine\nyears in the 1990s, recently Seinfeld\nstarted inspiring some interesting science as well.\nSeinfeld hit the news at the beginning\nof 2008 when some undergraduates at\nClemson University, USA, investigated\n\u2018double-dipping\u2019. 'Double-dipping' is\none of those many phrases that entered\nthe vernacular after appearing in this\nsitcom. What it stands for is dipping\none\u2019s chip/nacho into a dip after one\nhas already taken a bite. George, one of\nthe unluckiest characters on the show\ndoes precisely this at a funeral reception and gets verbally attacked for his\ndeed by his girlfriend\u2019s brother: \u201cDid...\ndid you just double-dip that chip?!\n...That\u2019s like putting your whole mouth\nright in the dip!\u201d\nBut is it really? George certainly\ndidn\u2019t agree with this. New research\ntested this by dipping crackers into\nsalsa sauce and chocolate syrup after a\nbite had already been taken. Researchers counted the number of aerobic\nbacteria and found that around 10,000\nwere transmitted in this way from\nmouth to dip in only a few dips!\nThe study, to be published this year\nin the Journal of Food Safety, was reported on by the New York Times and\nvarious blogs which picked up on this.\nThe researchers calculated that with\neach bite of a cracker dipped into the\nsauce that others have double-dipped\ninto, those dipping were risking ingesting between 50-100 bacteria indirectly,\nfrom mouth-to-mouth, in this way.\nThe lead researcher told NYT: \u201cThe\nway I would put it is, before you have\nsome dip at a party, look around and\nask yourself, would I be willing to kiss\neveryone here? Because you don\u2019t\nknow who might be double dipping,\nand those who do are sharing their saliva with you.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not all: in June 2008 a report appeared in the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology which supported\none of George\u2019s ideas. In one of the\nepisodes George, disgusted by himself for breaking-up violently with his\ngirlfriend who ends up in a depression\nclinic after this experience, says: \"I\u2019ve\ndriven women to lesbianism before,\nbut never to a mental institution...\u201d\nNow scientists are saying that some\nhomosexual women may indeed have\nbeen driven to their sexual orientation\nby violent and abusive acts by men in\ntheir previous heterosexual encoun-ters. Gordon Gallup, a psychologist\nfrom University of Albany, USA and\ncolleagues designed a questionnaire\nfor lesbians and heterosexual women\nabout their prior sexual experiences.\nBased on answers by 107 women they\nfound that lesbians experienced more\nThe baby-faced sociopath started to double-dip, then, seeing the consternation this odious practice aroused\namongst onlookers, proceeded to smear the rest of the dip over his foul maw, much to the disgust of all\nFor an animal that measures mere\nmillimetres in size, the mosquito is\nastounding for its ability to wreak devastation across the globe. Estimates\nsuggest that around half of the world\u2019s\npopulation has been affected at one\ntime or another by the malaria parasite\nthat the mosquitoes carry, with over\nhalf a billion new infections each year.\nQuite apart from the human tragedy\nof the disease, malaria holds back social and economic progress in some of\nthe planet\u2019s poorest countries, many of\nthem in sub-Saharan Africa. But the\nmillions of deaths worldwide could\nhinge on a surprisingly narrow bottleneck interaction between the mosquito and the Plasmodium parasite, which\ncauses the disease.\n\u201cWhenthemosquitosucksblood,she\ningests the parasite from the human,\nand it\u2019s inside the mid-gut of the insect\nthat the parasite starts sexual development,\u201d explained Timm Schlegelmilch,\na researcher at Imperial College, London. \u201c[The parasite] transforms into\nthe invasive form \u2026 and has to cross\nthe mid-gut wall, to start a massive\nreplication programme. It\u2019s exactly at\nthis stage that the parasite population\nsuffers great losses\u201d.\n\u201cThere are a couple of thousand parasites in the mosquito gut, and from\nthose only single digits complete the\njourney out. After that, they replicate\nagain \u2013 back up to 10,000 parasites \u2013\nbut that is our bottleneck.\u201d The implication is clear; narrow that bottleneck\na bit further and the parasite might not\nbe able to make it out of the mosquito\nalive.\nMuch of the current work on malaria\nis done on rats in labs, and Schlegelmilch was concerned at how transferable\nthat work is to the human form of the\ndisease out in the wild.\nHis lab recently succeeded in genetically modifying mosquitoes to subtly alter their gut chemistry, before\ncomparing how the mosquitoes fared\nagainst both the human- and rat-forms\nof malaria, and were excited by the\nresults. Fiddling with genes that control the way the mosquito moves fat\naround its body or structures its cells\nmight not seem terribly useful, but the\nresearch showed that both of these had\na big impact on the survival of the parasites in the mosquito gut.\n\u201cThere are many labs trying to make\nthe transition of lab work to the field\n\u2013 and here at Imperial we\u2019re the first\nto have succeeded in doing that with a\nhuman strain of malaria\u201d, Schlegelmilch added. \u201cIt was real, in-the-field\nmalaria. We used samples from human\ncarriers in Cameroon\u201d.\nScience has advanced against malaria in the past, only to be beaten back,\nand Schlegelmilch is wary of making\nany grand claims. The eventual aim\nis to throw a spanner in the works of\nmalaria transmission, but he admitted\n\u201cwe\u2019re still at the stage of asking \u2018what\nis going on?\u2019. Interrupting transmis-sion? I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll be alive when\nthat happens\u201d.\nStill, malaria charities have welcomed the idea that the latest weapon\nagainst the disease is slowly inching its\nway off the drawing board and onto\nthe battlefield. Robert Mather, founder of Against Malaria, compared the\nproblem to a puzzle. \u201cMosquito gene\nresearch is very important. It has the\npotential to add significantly to our\nability to fight malaria. If another piece\nof the mosquito gene jigsaw puzzle has\nbeen found, that is good news\u201d.\nBut Mather was keen to stress that\nscientific research can only ever be one\npart of the solution. When dealing with\na problem of this scale, sometimes the\nsimplest solutions can be best. \u201cNow,\nand for many years to come, bed nets\nare likely to remain the single most\neffective thing we can deploy to stop\nthree million people dying, totally\navoidably, each year.\u201d\nHitting the sauce. As she chugs away on her victims, the mosquito can ingest malaria parasites. But few\ncan escape through her gut wall to infect the next victim: a natural bottleneck which scientists want to cork\nsexual and physical abuse by men, and\nthat this happened at a younger age\nthan for heterosexual women. The\nteam concludes that such negative experiences with the opposite sex may\nhave lead some lesbians to their current\nsexual orientation, homosexuality.\n\u201cNot that there\u2019s anything wrong\nwith it\u201d Seinfeld would jokingly add,\nbut there is something wrong with\nabusing women and whilst this study\nmainly aims at explaining the evolutionary enigma of homosexual behav-iour, it also raises awareness of sexual\nand physical abuse that should not be\ntolerated.\nImran Khan\nScienfeld: the science of Seinfeld\nMalaria and the mosquito: a story of blood and guts, which may end well\n\u201cDouble-dipping\nyour cracker\ntransfers around\n10,000 bacteria\ninto the dip\u201d\n\n"

Betjeman was one of\nthe first poets I came to know and love\nduring my care-free days at the Dragon\nSchool, North Oxford, where Betjeman himself spent his preparatory\nschool years. His poem \u2018May-Day Song\nfor North Oxford\u2019 resonates strongly\nand completely captures the beauty of\nthose roads with their lush vegetation\nand red-bricked houses.\nI long for those days, somewhat:\nthe time when I managed to pass my\nCommon Entrance with flying colours\nwithout the need to even skim one\npage of notes for any of my subjects,\nschool sports day on the Dragon playing fields bordering the Cherwell river\nand school-girl crushes. So much has\nchanged.\nAfter spending his secondary school\nyears at Marlborough College, Betjeman attended Oxford as a \u2018commoner\u2019\n(a non-scholarship student) but only\njust. It seemed that studying was not\nsecond nature to him, either. He soon\nbegan to realise that the good life was\nfor him and so his routine of partying\nfinally resulted in him being \u2018sent down\u2019\nfrom Oxford for failing his exams.\nNot a poet for Angry Geek! Betjeman\u2019s conservatism sprung from the\nfact that he deplored \u2018progress\u2019. That\nis, the demise in ancient buildings and\nthe British countryside. He did not see\nhow it was possible for us to be truly\nhappy in a world of increasing ugliness\nand inhibitions. In \u2018The Executive\u2019, he\nsatirises the stereotype by writing from\nthe perspective of the yuppie.\nParticularisation is continually used\nby Betjeman in his poems. In stead of\nsimply referring to objects as \u2018cars\u2019 and\n\u2018marmalade\u2019 he will use their brand\nnames which acts as a clever way of inferring social status and also the time\nat which the poem as written. He does\nthis in a topographical sense too, with\nmany of his poems bearing the names\nof places. The second poem here is\nSlough, which was read by the character David Brent in The Office television series which happens to be set in\nSlough.\nSome critics see this as his inability\nto see things in an abstract way. However, I find this technique to be highly\neffective as it is a way of ensuring readers can identify more closely to the\ncontent of the poems (as I related so\nwell to the mention of street names in\nhis \u2018May-Day Song for North Oxford\u2019.)\nA lot of you reading these poems may\nbe able to relate to them: having visited\nSlough or aware of its notoriety as an\nutter shit hole (sorry). Or maybe you\nare considering a career in the world of\nbusiness. Either way, it is hard not to\nfall for Betjeman\u2019s comic writing.\nSlough\nCome, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough\nIt isn\u2019t fit for humans now,\nThere isn\u2019t grass to graze a cow\nSwarm over, Death!\nCome, bombs, and blow to smithereens\nThose air-conditioned, bright canteens,\nTinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans\nTinned minds, tinned breath.\nMess up the mess they call a town --A house for ninety-seven down\nAnd once a week for half-a-crown\nFor twenty years,\nAnd get that man with double chin\nWho\u2019ll always cheat and always win,\nWho washes his repulsive skin\nIn women\u2019s tears,\nAnd smash his desk of polished oak\nAnd smash his hands so used to stroke\nAnd stop his boring dirty joke\nAnd make him yell.\nBut spare the bald young clerks who add\nThe profits of the stinking cad;\nIt\u2019s not their fault that they are mad,\nThey\u2019ve tasted Hell.\nIt\u2019s not their fault they do not know\nThe birdsong from the radio,\nIt\u2019s not their fault they often go\nTo Maidenhead\nAnd talk of sports and makes of cars\nIn various bogus Tudor bars\nAnd daren\u2019t look up and see the stars\nBut belch instead.\nIn labour-saving homes, with care\nTheir wives frizz out peroxide hair\nAnd dry it in synthetic air\nAnd paint their nails.\nCome, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough\nTo get it ready for the plough.\nThe cabbages are coming now;\nThe earth exhales.\nThe Executive\nI am a young executive.

Edward Muir explains\nthat just as the smaller version of your\nown house is the dolls\u2019-house, this allows us to visualise the relationship of\nthe parts to the whole. He describes the\nminiature model as offering a closed,\nsimplified example that we can use to\nanticipate the future in some way or\nat least learn, by controlling a replica\nin its whole, how to behave in actual\nsituations. In fact this very method of\nusing models and miniatures allows\nus to detach ourselves somewhat from\nthe subject of \u2018Fucking Hell\u2019 \u2013 it allows\nus to physically and psychologically\ndominate the material. The Chapman\nbrothers have also explored the reverse\n\u2013 exhibited at the former Saatchi gallery at Somerset House from Saatchi\u2019s\nown collection were several life-size\ndolls of adolescents, but hybridised\nand confused in gender by a mass of\nconjoined limbs and protruding genitals on various and unnatural places on\ntheir bodies. I watched first-hand as\nthe viewer gave a wide berth to these\nstatic poup\u00e9es, feeling the talismanic\npower of these troubling zygotic \u2018children\u2019 pushing you far too close to the\nborders of the taboo. A fully illustrated\ncatalogue accompanying the exhibition\nprovides a number of essays by Rod\nMengham and Simon Baker among\nothers, offering historical references\nand philosophical treaties with which\nto interpret \u2018Fucking Hell\u2019 by. An illustrated \u2018guide\u2019 also plucks out certain\nmore notable details from amongst the\ncomplicated mass of tiny figures within\nthe tableaux, such as the cowering figure of little Anne Frank, alone in an at-tic, to the figure of Adolf Hitler abreast\na pit of despair yet calmly painting a\nbland watercolour (perhaps the only\nbright spot of colour in the murk of the\nentire installation). Stephen Hawking\nalso makes an appearance, as does a\nreference to Theodore Gericault\u2019s \u2018The\nRaft of the Medusa\u2019 \u2013 a painting made\nin response to the tragedy of the sinking of the Medusa in 1816, whose only\nremaining survivors clung to a raft for\nfifteen days and incurred violence,\nbrutality and even cannibalism. With\n\u2018Fucking Hell\u2019 the Chapman brothers\nhave presented us with several vitrines\nlike cabinets of curiosities \u2013 fascinating\nand gruesome, the narratives comical\nyet dark.

It was the perfect way to start\nthe year and it was great to see so many of you active right from the beginning of the Autumn term.\nThe Union had some very good news at the end of the autumn term. Just before Christmas we announced that \u00a33.3m\nhad been secured which would allow the Union to upgrade and modernise our facilities for student activities. Since\nthen a lot of the design work has been completed by the architects and building work is due to commence this autumn.\nThe centrepiece of this project will be a new mezzanine second floor in the Union gym to allow for an enlarged Student\nActivity Centre and a new multi-purpose space on the 3rd floor of the Union Building. This will ensure that future\nstudents can enjoy top quality facilities fit for the 21st century and having seen the plans develop I am looking forward\nto coming back for a visit when it is all finished. Whilst working on this project the concerns of the student body about\nthe Union\u2019s environmental impact have been taken on board. A major theme of this work is energy efficiency and several\nmeasures are being introduced that will ensure that our building operates in a sustainable manner.\n2007/2008 has been another outstanding year for our Clubs and Societies and we have seen almost a 10% year-on-year increase in the number of memberships taking the total number sold to over 12,000. Around 6,350 students are\nmembers of at least one of over 300 clubs and societies, representing a participation rate of over 52%. Whilst official\nstatistics are not available we believe that Imperial College Union currently offers a student activities programme with\nthe largest participation rate and is the most generously funded compared to all other UK universities.\nIt would almost require me to write a dissertation to do full justice to the achievements of you all this year but here are\nsome of the highlights and headline figures:\u2022 The student media at Imperial College went from strength to strength with Live!, the student news website of\nImperial College being named \u201cBest Student Website\u201d in The Guardian Student Media Awards 2007.\n\u2022 The Union\u2019s minibuses clocked up over 110,000 miles this year \u2013 the equivalent of driving around the planet four and\na half times!\n\u2022 Surgical Society championed the first undergraduate plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery conference which\ndrew in students from across the UK.\n\u2022 1407 Imperial Students gave up their time to organise activities for other students by becoming an officer of one or\nmore clubs. The Union gave countless opportunities for students to develop their leadership capabilities and personal\nskills whilst the student body benefited massively from the efforts of this large number of volunteers.\n\u2022 The spring term saw the usual plethora of shows and cultural events, with Indian Society\u2019s East Meets West being\nhosted at the London Palladium for the first time.\n\u2022 Imperial College Union\u2019s sports teams played in 1003 competitive sports fixtures this year \u2013 equivalent to 84 days of\ncontinuous playing time.\nThe Union\u2019s Advice Centre helped hundreds of students with issues such as taking unscrupulous landlords to court,\nliaising with Transport for London and representing students in academic and disciplinary hearings. Your elected\nrepresentatives have continued to contribute to College committees to fulfil our goal of ensuring that a student voice is\nheard at the highest levels of decision making in the College so that policy decisions can be influenced to our benefit.\nIn particular, our work on the student status of writing-up PhD students has resulted in a College policy change which\nwill result in some students saving hundreds of pounds on their Council Tax bill. Academic representatives are often the\nunsung heroes of Students\u2019 Unions and we as a student body benefit enormously from their hard work and diligence as\nthey go about communicating our concerns to the College.\nOne of the fundamental principles of Students\u2019 Unions is that they are democratic organisations that are led by the\npeople they serve. This year saw a 40% year-on-year increase in turnout for the sabbatical elections with over 2,300\nstudents voting in the election which saw Jennifer Morgan returned as my successor. The elections for part-time\nofficers have also seen an increased number of candidates and voter turnout compared to last year and it is excellent to\nsee that so many of you have a lot of ideas as to how the Union could be improved for all students at the College.\nThroughout this article I have referred to \u201cthe Union\u201d but it is not quite clear what I mean by this object. For the\npurposes of this piece I will define \u201cthe Union\u201d in its broadest sense is a collective of all students at Imperial College\nand without the hard work and dedication of the other sabbaticals, the Union\u2019s full time staff and hundreds of part-time\nvolunteers none of the above achievements would have been realised. It has been a privilege leading and working with\nsuch an outstanding group of people this year and I hope that through my efforts I have repaid the trust that the student\nbody placed in me when I was elected. On that note I would like to wish Jen and her team all the very best for next year\nin their efforts to ensure that the Union continues to evolve to meet the needs of an ever-changing student body.\nunionpage\nUnion Review of theY\near\nStephen Brown\nImperial College Union President 2007/2008\n\n"

We don\u2019t really\nsee each other outside the department,\nand although he\u2019s quite funny, I\u2019ve always been happy with that. The other\nnight, after our last exam, a group of us\nfrom my course went out. I ended up\nhooking up with the guy, and it was so\nhot! But the next day all I could think\nabout was how I\u2019ve ruined our friend-ship, because I don\u2019t want to be with\nhim. What can I do?\nAlienated\nDear Alienated,\nThis situation depends a lot on what\nwent on the next morning. If you were\nhungover in any way and he had to\nnurse you back to health, you\u2019ve pretty\nmuch promised him your ovaries for his\nfirst-born.

Only problem is, the Union,\nsource of much cheap ale and snake-bite, has banned me from entering after I\u2026 actually I can\u2019t remember what\nI did, because I was HAMMERED!\nFucking great. Anyway, how can I get\nnestled back into the loving folds of\nflab of the Union belly?\nLovableRogue\nDear LovableRogue,\nDisguise is key. They couldn\u2019t refuse Sir\nRichard, or that new bloke, entry to the\nUnion, could they now? Get a good suit,\nand a haircut, and a slightly surprising\naccent (given your well cut suit). Or,\ndress up as me. (See below for description of dress; think Thatcher mixed\nwith Dot Cotton.)

Where have all the\neligible bachelors gone?\nCarrieWannabe\nDear CarrieWannabe,\nBeing the spinsterish cat lady that I am\n(often seen trawling around Hammersmith with plastic bags tied to my feet in\nlieu of shoes. No, really, that\u2019s me), I\u2019ve\nhonestly got no clue. You\u2019re essentially\nasking how not to end up resentful and\nunhappy.

We have discovered systematic\ndoucheness pervading the Felix office\nand a startling lack of concern about\nthe quality of conversation, company\nkept or even basic hygiene. The entire\nFelix staff are, to put it nicely, tools.\nObviously this is a controversial\nclaim to make and one would need a\nlarge amount of evidence in order to\njustify such a comment. Well I have\na large amount of evidence, the paper trail is longer than my penis and\nthat\u2019s saying something (if you want to\nsay something about my penis, please\nemail hangman. If you want to book\nmy penis to speak at your event, also\nemail hangman). Sorry, yes, the paper\ntrail. This Felix is proof of my claims.\nI know you usually flick through Felix, searching desperately for the Hangman page, but if you stop and actually\nread some of the stuff in the rest of this\nnewspaper: you\u2019d be horrified. Lets begin with News. Ok take a deep breath\nand turn to the News pages. Back yet?\nit\u2019s ok, your safe again just relax, what\ndid you see? NUS referendum? Council? Meaningless bullshit? Ah it\u2019s that\nAndrew Somerville character, he\u2019s the\none dressed like Death\u2019s goth cousin\non the right hand side of the picture.\nLuckily he\u2019s finished his barrel scrap-ings of a degree and off to prostitute\nhimself to the real world; we won\u2019t be\nseeing him around anymore.\nYou don\u2019t think dressing like a goth\nmakes you a tool? Ok, there\u2019s more.\nTurn to the politics, business or fashion section. Back? Come on, stop shak-ing, you\u2019re back with hangman. Take\noff those wet clothes and come sit\nwith me... More likely than not, there\nisn\u2019t even a politics, business or fashion section this week. This is because\nthe section editors have realized that\nnobody read anything they wrote. You\nHaxz0rMcRandy_1\nL33t interweb Haxzor\ncan see these tools in the centre of the\nphoto: Kadhim Shubber, Dan Wan and\nAfonso Campos. Look at them having\nfun... only tools have fun... tools and\ncommunists.\nThe list goes on. The good-looking\nArts Editors, reclusive Music Editors,\nbarely breathing Nightlife Editor, Greg\nMead and the International Editor,\nare all liars and cheats. The Arts Editors are all blind, the Music Editors are\ndeaf, the Nightlife Editor is allergic to\nthe dark and the International Editor...\nwell, he\u2019s never even left the country.\nI ask you, readers, how does Gilead\nAmit know what\u2019s going on in the rest\nof the world? I suppose he has a crystal\nball... or more likely still... he makes it\nup! I mean who\u2019s even heard of a country called China? All intelligent people\nknow that china is the stuff you drink\nEarl Grey out of... unless you\u2019re poor\nYou might want to look through the\nrest of the evidence we have presented\ni.e. the newspaper you have in your\nhands, but if you have a heart condition or even an iota of common sense,\nyou\u2019ll stay on these two pages.\nWhat are we trying to achieve by\nexposing our colleagues with this self-indulgent article? Some may argue that\nwe are unprofessional, spiteful... even,\ndare I say, sex Gods. We have two\nthings to say to these people. 1. Shut up\nand 2. Tell your mum to shut up too.\nNotice anything missing from the\npicture above? That\u2019s right, the Hangman Editors aren\u2019t in the picture.\nReaders, we simply weren\u2019t invited. We\nhave been suppressed and isolated for\ntoo long and it\u2019s time these so called\n\u2018real Editors\u2019 got retribution, or at least\nlengthy prison sentences.\nYou must be wondering \u2018how can I\nhelp the Hangman team\u2019? If you are a\nsexy lady, come join the Felix team. If\nyou are a sexy man, stay away, it\u2019s hard\nenough to get into the Arts Editors\u2019\npants without even more competi-tion. Otherwise, phone up your local\nAmerican Embassy and ask for regime\nchange, aerial bombing and waffles.\nTogether we can make a change, we can\nbuild a better future. We can save our\nchildren from wankers. Yes we can, yes\nwe can ... yes we can (fade to black)\n\n"

Are we all high?\nTom Roberts &\nAndrew Somerville\nAn investigation by Felix has uncovered evidence suggesting that cocaine\nuse occurs in 70% of South Kensington\ncampus toilets. The survey found positive indications in most of the major\ndepartments, the Union building and\nmost significantly the \u2018Blue Cube\u2019 Faculty Building \u2013 a building that is off-limits to students.\nFelix visited 47 toilets across the cam-pus: 31 mens\u2019, 9 womens\u2019 and 7 disabled\nlavatories. At each site, swabs designed\nto indicate the presence of cocaine\nwere used to test the toilet seat covers,\ncisterns, hinges and other available flat\nsurfaces for traces of the illegal drug,\nwith surprising results. Out of the 47\ntests, 34 gave positive results: 22 mens\u2019,\n6 womens\u2019 and 6 disabled, all indicating\nvarying quantities of the substance.\nThe \u2018cocaine swabs\u2019 used in the Felix\ninvestigation are identical to those used\nin similar tests conducted at the universities of York, Exeter and Cambridge\nand similar to those used to test toilets\nat the European Parliament in Brussels\nby a major German broadcaster, which\nwere later verified by thorough forensic\ntests. The manufacturer also supplies\ndrug testing kits to various UK police\nagencies, including the Metropolitan\nPolice, and the Prison Service, as well as\nto student and professional press. The\nswabs are sensitive to a few milligrams\nof the \u201cfunctional group\u201d of chemicals\nto which cocaine belongs. Similar tests,\nusing the same active reagent, are used\nworldwide in field tests for cocaine and\nother banned substances, but do not\ngive unequivocal and forensic proof of\ndrug presence.\nWhen presented with these results,\nstudents consulted by Felix expressed\ntheir surprise at the choice of location\nfor recreational drug use: most expected drug use in the Union buildings\nduring club nights and other events\nbut not in departmental buildings. All\nstudents and staff were shocked by the\nindication of cocaine use in the Faculty Building, since students are not\nable to enter the \u2018Blue Cube\u2019 without\nbeing admitted by a member of staff.\nThis result, combined with the large\nproportion of positive indications, suggests that cocaine abuse at Imperial is\nnot limited to students alone, but is a\nfar more prevalent and pervasive issue\nthat encompasses students, academics\nand administrative staff.\nFelix also investigated the reliability\nof these types of test, since they have\nproduced similar results at other institutions and because of the startling\nfrequency with which the swabs indicated positive matches. We consulted\nDr Russell Taylor, a researcher in the\nChemistry department with previous\nexperience at the Forensic Science\nService, who performed a number of\nchemical tests on the swabs.\nIn his opinion, the swab test was in-conclusive. \u201cIt is impossible to detect\none substance alone, this test doesn\u2019t\nspecifically detect cocaine\u201d he said,\n\u201ca positive result can be brought on\nby chemicals of similar functional\ngroups\u2026 [due to this] as chemists, we\nwould say that it is a bad test.\u201d\nThe test is known to give a positive\nresult in the presence of several other\nmedications and drugs, including\nsome sleeping pills, psychedelics, and\ncertain types of antihistamines. The\ntest could also be sensitive to other unknown compounds that could have a\nmore legitimate use in toilets, although\nFelix has not found a cleaning product\nthat gives a positive result.\nThe Managing Director of Crackdown Drug Testing Ltd, Dave Rigg, a\nformer police officer of 17 years, has\nalso been on record to vouch for the\n1. Union dB\u2019s,\nMens\u2019, ground\nfloor\n2. Physics,\nMens\u2019, Level 6\n3. Sherfield,\nDisabled, Level 2\n4. Huxley building,\nMens\u2019, Level 3\n5. Chemical\nEngineering,\nMens\u2019, Level 3\n6. Civil Engineering,\nMens\u2019, Level 3\n7. Faculty Building,\nDisabled, Level 1\n8. Huxley building,\nMens\u2019, Level 6M\nEight of the \u2018cocaine swabs\u2019 used in Felix\u2019s investigation are pictured above. The seven swabs on the left indicate a positive match whereas the final swab on the right shows no sign\nof blue coloration, and hence is a negative. The swabs are sensitive enough for us to conclude that cocaine is definitely not present in the areas tested with the right-hand swab,\nthough Imperial College chemists have suggested that chemicals with the same \u201cfunctional group\u201d as cocaine could have triggered the blue reaction in the seven left-hand swabs.\nSwabs numbers 1, 2, 3 and 7 appear to have a grainier blue indication\ntests. \u201cWe have complete confidence\nin the kit. If it tests positive it is almost definite that someone has been\nsnorting cocaine from that surface,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cIf it has been on a surface that\nis cleaned regularly and thoroughly, it\ncan only detect recent use.\u201d\nWhilst the cocaine test is not foolproof and only indicates the likely\npresence of cocaine or similar chemi-cals, there are several arguments\nwhich suggest the illegal drug rather\nthan a false-positive due to an obscure\ncompound. Firstly, several toilets were\ntested that were adjacent (for example\nmale and female pairs), and would likely be subject to the same cleaning regime and substances, yet gave different\nresults from each other. Secondly, it\nis extremely unlikely that people have\nbeen taking their antihistamines and\nother powdered medications by snorting them from the toilet seat.\nThe results obtained by Felix, whilst\nnot scientifically rigorous, suggest a\nworryingly prevalent use of cocaine on\nImperial\u2019s main campus in a shockingly wide demographic. College appears\nto have a drug problem that is not restricted to students alone.\nFormer police officer and Managing Director of Crackdown Drug\nTesting Ltd, Dave Rigg, vouches for the swabs\u2019 credibility, saying\nthat they \u201care accurate as a field test, but I would not go to court\nwith [them].\u201d The swabs contain the chemical compound cobalt\nthiocyanate, a reagent commonly used in drug tests in various\nforms, though their reliability has been called into question by\nexperts in the field of forensic chemistry\nCobalt thiocyanate test kit\nA positive result: blue indicates likely presence of cocaine\n\n"

David J Paw takes a look\nVogue China\u2019s circulation is second only to its American counterpart\nE\nmerging markets excite\nme more than American\nmarkets.\u201d So said Tom\nFord, as he readied himself for the task ahead.\nFord had been travelling\nthe latitude of Asia to secure a minimum of 87 franchised stores throughout the continent and Australasia over\nthe next ten years.\nThis commitment is only a fraction of the activity that has turned\nthe continent from the backwater\nof a century ago into the newest\nplayer in the world\u2019s developing\nnew order, and the expansion of Western luxury brands into the East is but\na segment of the seething activity at\nhand. Notably, much of the focus is on\nthat emerging economic juggernaut,\nChina.\nStraddling the uneasy ground between its communist ideology and\noft-capitalist reality, China\u2019s flourishing economy has fuelled a thriving new\nmiddle class bent on absorbing and\nintegrating Western lifestyles and consuming every luxury brand presented\nto them by their newfound messiahs.\nAngelica Cheung, editor-in-chief of\nVogue China, says it best: \u201cChina is becoming more and more sophisticated.\nThe most important thing is that today\nin China you feel the will to be more\nfashionable, and the desire to live a\nbetter life is very strong. And with the\nnew money, [you] have the means of\ndoing it.\u201d\nThat desire is manifest everywhere\nyou look in its glimmering coastal cities \u2013 Beijing boasts some of the world\u2019s\nmost dazzling buildings by star architects while Guangzhou\u2019s recent initiative to boost the arts, coupled to its\nunrelenting economic progress as a\nregional capital, is transforming it into\none of Asia\u2019s definitive megacities. The\npreviously rural Shenzen is utterly un-recognisable now, its allocation as China\u2019s first free-trade zone transforming\nit into a commercial and creative haven\nfor risk takers and moneymakers within the space of a single generation. And\nthrough it all, the metropolis of Shanghai has spiralled higher, establishing\nitself as the nation\u2019s creative epicentre\nand coming into view of reclaiming its\ntitle as the \u201cParis of the East\u201d. You can\nhear it in the clack of Louboutin stilettos and feel it in the cool, smooth Italian marble in an elevator whisking its\noccupants to an opulent rooftop bar.\nJessica Ward, a boutique owner who\nrelocated to Shanghai from Toronto\nsays, \u201cThere\u2019s a palpable energy even\nwhen you step into the street. There\u2019s\na feeling that anything is possible and\nthat the city\u2019s inhabitants are raring to\nreinvent and define the city for the 21st\ncentury\u201d.\nWard is only one of a new generation of creative professionals who are\nrecognising the city\u2019s potential. Its inaugural fashion week, coupled with\nthat of Beijing\u2019s, are symptomatic of\nthe nation\u2019s increasing sophistication\nand savvy, as well as its desire to put its\nown creative stamp and gain recognition overseas. But how do the Chinese\nview luxury? \u201cChina is still a young\nmarket, and subsequently not yet as sophisticated overall as more established\nmarkets\u201d, explains Tiffany Zhou, a marketing consultant from Hong Kong.\n\u201cDesigner clothing and accessories are\nstill used to signify status and unlike\nWestern cities, there is more desire for\nconformity. Though well known brand\nnames are coveted, conversely there is\nless interest in owning unique pieces\nthat stress the buyer\u2019s individuality\u201d.\nSuch is the power of the brand that\n\u201cLouis Vuitton\u201d is the equivalent term\nfor \u201cluxury\u201d.\nConsequently China\u2019s new spending\npower, coupled with an appetite for\nrecognisable status pieces, has offset a\ndash by major luxury players to satisfy\nits demands in response. Italian luxury\nconglomerate PPR (that owns both\nGucci and Tom Ford) has set up numerous franchises in the major coastal\nhotspots, and Beijing alone has seen a\nmassive high-end injection: new Prada\nand Gucci flagships, new stores from\nCartier, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani and\nan imposing new outlet of Hong Kong\nluxury department store Lane Crawford offering elite designer lines such\nas Maison Martin Margiela, Marni,\nMiu Miu and more.\nLane Crawford\u2019s presence is notable\n\u2013 not only is the brand expanding its\nreach with stores and an ambitious internationally published ad campaign,\nbut it provides for the most discerning shoppers who reject the vulgarity\nof logos and statement pieces. Despite\nthe majority\u2019s desire to conform, for\na small and very discerning minority there exists a niche that the store\nhappily indulges. \u201cThey\u2019re as clued-up to international fashion as their\nEuropean and American counterparts\u201d, Zhou explains. Though a lot of\nluxury sales are based around indulging the consumer\u2019s desires, much of\nthe luxury sector\u2019s growth has been\nencouraged by the custom of guanxi,\nor gift-giving, as a means of building\npersonal relationships and connec-tions. The government\u2019s suspicion of\ncash gifts has led to the less conspicuous exchange of opulent luxury items;\na Chanel clutch can\u2019t offer the same\nfreedom as money, but it makes a very\nfine substitute.\nHowever, for every Chinese Margiela devotee, there are scores of others struggling to separate their Marni\nfrom their Missoni. It is therefore\nof little wonder that the influential\nfashion press have had shop set up in\nChina for a while, in anticipation of a\ndemand for sartorial guidance. Vogue\nChina\u2019s 300,000-strong circulation \u2013\nimpressive for a relatively new title \u2013 is\nsecond in the Vogue stable only to its\nAmerican counterpart, and Elle China\nhas been here for even longer. What\nmakes Vogue China different from\nother international editions? \u201cWe add\nan educational element\u2026For Italian\nVogue or American Vogue it would be\nenough to just run the fashion pictures\nbecause the women are sophisticated\nenough to get the idea. But the Chinese\nwomen are not there yet, so we have to\ntell them more about the inspirations\u201d,\nsaid editor Cheung in 2007.\nFor a nation with so much raw potential but with little idea of what to\ndo with it, such guidance is necessary.\nDespite Shanghai and Beijing\u2019s emerging stature, Hong Kong has long been\nestablished as an Eastern financial and\ncultural capital, and its dwarfing by its\nmainland counterpart has led to an informational symbiosis of sorts, based\non its well-developed business acumen\nin the development and presentation\nof new ideas \u2013 pivotal if China wants\nto produce its own star designers worthy of international recognition. In ad-dition, in comparison to Hong Kong,\nthe average Mainland Chinese woman\nlacks the sophistication and experience in identifying, transferring and\nintegrating major trends into personal\niterations \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s edge is its international know-how and long-seated\nrole in the global community. Once\nthe Mainland closes that gap, Hong\nKong\u2019s advantage will be less well\ndemarcated.\nSpeaking of star designers, between\nWestern and Chinese designers, it\nseems clear which the domestic market\nprefers. That is not to say that China\nlacks talent \u2013 Shanghai-based designers such as the avant-garde Wang Yiyang and Zhang Da both have devoted\nConsumers in major Chinese cities are more interested in conforming than in making individual statements\n\u201cOnce the\nmainland\ncloses the gap,\nHong Kong\u2019s\nadvantage will\nbe less well\ndemarcated\u201d\n\u201cChina\u2019s\nflourishing\neconomy has\nfuelled a thriving\nnew middle class\nbent on Western\nlifestyles\u201d\n\n"
