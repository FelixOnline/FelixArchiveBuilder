    "content": "Just killing time\nRevenge, murder and eighties pop music can only mean one thing. Ben Elton emerges red handed\nfrom another foray into crime writing, but Martin Smith, Books Editor, is hot on his trail\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 October 2004\n22\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nDetective Inspector Edward\nNewson, or \u2018Spewsome Newson\u2019 as\nthe class of \u201988 would have known\nhim, was not very big for a police-man. However, he has a big problem in the shape of a series of\nbizarre murders that no-one else\nbelieves are related.\nUnfortunately, the size of this problem is insignificant compared to\nhis feelings of sexual dysfunction\nand his longing for the return of\nthat golden decade of 1980 when,\nfor a fleeting week or so, he had\nthe attention of the most attractive girl in the school, Christine\nCopperfield. While Newson was\ntortured for both his height and\nred hair during the \u2018best days of\nhis life\u2019 by his peers, the Christmas\ndance of that year is one of the few\ncomforting memories that can distract him from his recent divorce\nand his unrequited love for his ser-geant. And of course the killer who\nleaves no clues aside from a love\nof pop music seems to be laughing at him too. Could his school\nday reminiscing give some link to\nthese strange killings?\nPast Mortem rollercoasters in\nquality somewhat, but the overriding theme here is the way in which\nit\u2019s written. It\u2019s trash. The vertically challenged need not despair:\nthe plot twists aren\u2019t tight enough\nto cause a height restriction on\nthis ride. However, the first sex\nscene may frighten some readers\nback to the Disney-themed merry-go-round.\nElton seems to think he\u2019s keeping us all in suspense by holding out the plotline until the second half of the book. Some people\nwould call this pacing, and they\u2019d\nbe right when referring to the final\nchapters which really are page-turners, but I quickly became tired\nof Newson\u2019s incessant pining for\nSergeant Natasha Wilkie at the\nend of every chapter.\nIn order to make up for the apparent lack of direction in the first 150\npages or so, we are treated to the\nproduct of the writer\u2019s brainstorm\nof \u2018How many different ways can\nsomeone feasibly die?\u2019 The first\nvictim literally leaks to death from\nover three hundred tiny punctures\nin his body, and another is flicked to\ndeath by being very lightly bludgeoned hundreds of times, possibly\nwith a copy of the yellow pages.\nThis aspect should be enough to\nkeep most people reading, if only\nout of \u2018car crash curiosity\u2019.\nHowever, I\u2019m sorry to say that I\nwas able to guess the identity of\nthe killer well before the end, as the\ntraditional series of herrings would\nbe more accurately described as\npastel fuchsia rather than bright\nred. Unfortunately this leaves a\nblack comedy crime thriller that\nmade me neither laugh nor have\nto think too hard about what was\ncoming next. Although the climax\nof the book is much better than\nthe rest and perhaps even worth\nthe journey to get there, the overall trash literature theme doesn\u2019t\nmake you too concerned for any\nmajor character\u2019s safety. But then,\nyou weren\u2019t actually expecting an\nunhappy ending from Ben Elton,\nwere you?\nIn short, this book really is exactly what it seems, and would make\nperfect holiday reading for those of\nyou who loved Popcorn, which won\nthe Crime Writer\u2019s Association\nGold Dagger Award. While the idea\nfor the plot is really quite a good\none, and the book is well written\nfor deck chair purposes, I\u2019m not\nsure this one will be winning any\nprizes. It\u2019s sure to be a hit with\nElton\u2019s fans though.\nPast Mortem\nby Ben Elton\n(Bantam Press)\n\u00a317.99, 372 pages\nHHIII\n\u201c...the product of the\nwriter\u2019s brainstorm:\n\u2018How many different\nways can someone\nfeasibly die?\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s cricket Jim,\nbut not as we know it\nLadies and gentleman, Alpha Centaurians and Betelgeusians, please have your thumbs ready for the\nlong awaited Tertiary Phase. Who else to review it but bloody Martin Smith from Croydon?\nFor the benefit of the three or four\nstudents at Imperial who somehow\naren\u2019t already familiar with The\nHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy,\nallow me to introduce you to the\nlatest, and unfortunately one of\nthe last, contributions of Douglas\nAdams to human civilization.\nArthur Dent is one of only two\nhuman survivors of the destruction\nof planet Earth, and equipped only\nwith this guide book to hitchhiking\nthrough the cosmos and few odd\ncompanions he\u2019s accumulated on\nthe way, is reluctantly cajoled into\nsaving the universe once again from\na fate worse than Marvin the paranoid android\u2019s existence. All this\nwithout the aid of a decent cup of\ntea.\nCricket could only have been\ninvented by the English. Not only is\nit mind-numbingly dull, but to most\nof the rest of the galaxy it\u2019s actually a rather offensive reminder of\na terrible and bloody war. So when\nArthur jumps backwards in time on\na Chesterfield sofa to find The Ashes\nbeing stolen by a team of robots\ndressed in cricket whites, his dismay\nis insignificant compared to the rest\nof the sentient universe\u2019s horror.\nTogether with Slartibartfast\u2019s Italian\nrestaurant powered ship, a couple of\npan-galactic Gargleblasters and the\nvoice of William Franklyn as the\nbook, they set off on another bizarre\nlap around the imagination of the\nlate Mr Adams.\nReturning to radio once again,\nThe Tertiary Phase follows the third\nbook of the series, Life the Universe\nand Everything, and in a dramatic\nbreak with tradition actually follows\nit fairly closely. Whilst the series\nfirst appeared on the radio and then\nwas adapted for the book, this phase\nhas come into being in exactly the\nopposite way, and unfortunately\nin places this still shows a little.\nThere\u2019s no way you can squeeze all\nof the detail and little jokes of the\nbook into just over three hours of\nradio time. Purists will be pleased\nto find a lot of the content, but those\nwhose familiarity with the books has\nsadly lapsed recently due to college\nwork may feel it\u2019s all a bit rushed.\nThe other major point of note\nhere is the unavoidable absence of\nPeter Jones. Nearly all the familiar\nvoices of the first series are here\nthough, and the narration handover\nis done amusingly at the beginning\nof the first episode in a fitting tribute for the benefit of the pedantic.\nThroughout, the charming \u2018deadline induced rambling\u2019 style of the\noriginal radio episodes is well recre-ated. Douglas Adams even appears\nin it himself, along with entertaining cameos from Fred Trueman\nand Henry Blofeld for those of you\nwho don\u2019t shudder at the thought\nof cricket. You can also hear that\nthey\u2019ve put in a lot of over time at\nthe lab to get the sound just right,\nusing some of the original music and\nsounds effects, and some original\nmusic for Marvin and the masters\nof planet Krikket.\nHowever, the real selling point\nhere is the twenty minutes of deleted bits dotted around each episode\nthat you won\u2019t have heard on Radio\n4. Some of these are golden, in particular Judiciary Pagg\u2019s extended\nsentencing scene. These and others will make the purchase worthwhile to those who have listened to\nthe broadcasts, especially with the\nadded incentive of meeting some of\nthe cast (see below). However, I\u2019d\nadvise others to read the book first.\n\u25cf The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the\nGalaxy: The Tertiary Phase was\nreleased on 25 October 2004.\nTo promote its release on\nCD, several cast members\nwill be attending a signing at\nForbidden Planet, Shaftesbury\nAvenue on Saturday 30\nOctober, 12\u20131pm.

With questions ranging from the rather distastefully answered \u201caccording to\nMichael Jackson, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter if... what\u201d (the answer\nwas \u2018black or White\u2019) to the\nsurprisingly heated discussions over naming the seven\ndwarfs, it was a night enjoyed\nby all.\nFollowing on from this,\nthe international food night\nproved to supply more dishes than I think I ate in my\nfirst year here let alone in\none night. With mountains\nremaining, it was to supply many a kitchen for the\nremainder of the week.\nWith the beerientering cancelled on the Thursday due to\nappalling weather (welcome\nto the UK, for those on their\nfirst trip), it was Wednesday\nwhich provided the memorable night of the week. What in\ntheory was a fairly quiet night\ninto Bracknell to the bowl-plex turned out to be a night\nof yet more alcohol-induced\n(at least I hope it was) rewriting of Silwood legend.\nThe final result was us being\nasked to leave, and we may\nnot return for a while.\nIt all came about due to us\nnot being able to find balls\nof the correct weight and so\nhaving to resort to human\nbowling. This proved to be\nmore accurate than using\nthe balls, as apparently you\nare allowed to knock down\nas many balls as you wish\nwhen you reach the other end\nand so this had exponential\neffects on the scores of these\nparticipating lanes. I would\nlike to point out here that I do\nnot endorse this behaviour,\nhowever I can understand\nthat from the point of view\nof a technically challenged\nbowler, ie someone rubbish\n(which I admit to be), it is\nvery easy to give in to temptation in order to improve\nyour score.\nThe week was rounded off\nby a typical Silwood party,\nwith the return of last years\ntwo resident DJs, as we\ncrammed the entire population into a tiny room and then\nbounced around until around\n4.30am (although if Silwood\nsecurity are reading, it was\n2am as we agreed, honest).\nA fantastic finale to a\nfortnight enjoyed by all,\nnew and old, at campuses\nall over the Imperial world.\nCongratulations to all those\ninvolved.\n\u25cf Photos by Tom Jones\nSilwood Freshers Fortnight: part two\nAutumn comes to Silwood: the beautiful manor house\nAround Campus felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Nichola Hawkins\nat the Wye campus\nFriday night saw the annual\n\u2018Olantigh Road\u2019 event in Wye.\nThis is the Union Executive\nCommittee\u2019s handover\nevent, Olantigh Road being\nthe Road to the Wye Union\nbuilding.\nTradition dictates that as\nthe old executive decorate\nthe hall, knowing that the\nnew exec will have to clear\nit away, they take full advantage of this arrangement, and\nthis year was no exception.\nThe chosen theme was\n\u2018The Grand National\u2019, complete with a miniature race\ncourse in the sports hall.\nAccording to a blackboard\nin the entrance, the building contained 20 tons of bark\nchippings, four tons of sand,\n10 bails of straw, four bags of\nsawdust, 32 square metres of\nturf and various other items\nincluding 10 tyres and three\ntrees. Those who spent the\nweekend with shovels and\nwheelbarrows gradually\nstarted to believe those fig-ures, although fortunately\n(being in Wye) one of the\nnew exec was able to bring\nhis tractor.\nFollowing the handover, the\nfirst major event to be organised by the new Wye College\nUnion Society (WCUS) officers is Wye\u2019s annual Charity\nWeek, for which a shameless\nplug now follows:\nThe week kicks off on\nSunday 31 October, with a\nHallowe\u2019en party.\nMonday sees a new addition to the traditional events,\nin the form of an international culture night hosted\nby Wye\u2019s Overseas Students\nOrganisation, with international music (including live\nmusic), food and films.\nTuesday returns to the traditional calendar, with the\ninfamous champagne break-fast. Guests turn up at the\ncrack of dawn, with black tie\ndress code, for a breakfast\nthat includes a whole bottle\nof bubbly at a mystery loca-tion. Only two people in Wye,\nmyself not included, know\nthe location in advance, but\nrecent locations have included a racecourse, a submarine\n(in dry dock), a dry sledging run and a \u201cdiggerland\u201d\ntheme park.\nIn the evening, there is\nanother new addition to the\nweek. DJ Benjy presents\n\u2018The Shake Down\u2019, the event\nformerly known as Urban\nNight, with R\u2019n\u2019B, hip-hop,\ngarage and dancehall tracks,\nand a chance for budding\nvocal artists to do their thing\nwith an open mic session.\nWednesday sees another\nold favourite, with a disco\nhosted by the Meteorological\nSociety, also known as the\nDruids, at an undisclosed\nlocation which has previously included a barn and a\ndisused chalk quarry. This is\nfollowed on Thursday by the\nslave auction, a chance to\nbuy yourself a fresher or two,\nas well being the only chance\nto buy back any property\nthat may have mysteriously\nvanished from students\u2019 bedrooms earlier in the week.\nFriday sees the Charity\nBall. The theme is 007, with\ncostumes (agents, bond\ngirls or villains) encouraged,\nbut black tie dress is also\nacceptable. The location will\nbe announced soon, but it\ncertainly promises to be a\ngrander occasion than this\nyear\u2019s Freshers\u2019 Ball.\nThe week culminates\nwith the Bonfire Party on\nSaturday, where students\nand villagers join together in\na torch-lit procession up to\nthe Crown (the highest field\non the Wye College Estate)\nfor Guy Fawkes celebrations.\nThe week reflects incoming\nWCUS President Dawinder\nSahota\u2019s election pledge to\n\u201ccombine the traditional Wye\nCollege events in the Union\nwith events that reflect the\nmore diverse and international nature of some of the\nstudents here.\u201d\nLast Monday, the Wye\nPostgraduate Association\nelected their new President,\ncompleting the new set of\nofficers, so students can\nexpect new plans to be\nunderway soon. Watch this\nspace...\nNew Wye executive take up the reins\nA typical Silwood resident:\nWye has sheep, Silwood has\nrabbits\n\n"

The idea is\nthat the American public is\nbeginning to notice that the\nUS is suffering over 90% of\nthe casualties in Iraq, and so\na high-profile redeployment\nof a famous regiment would\nreassure them that there\nis, in fact, a coalition in\ninvolved, rather than just US\nforces.\nThe Observer drew parallels between this week\u2019s\nmove and the sacrifice of\nScottish troops at Dunkirk,\npointing out that once again,\n\u201cScottish soldiers [are] being\nsent into harm\u2019s way on an\nugly suggestion of political\nexpediency\u201d.\nThe Times, however, argued\nthat to assume that sending\n650 soldiers into a dangerous\narea when there are already\n135,000 American troops will\nmollify the American public\nshows either \u201ca complete\nlack of understanding of\nAmerican politics or a patronising assumption that\nAmericans are so stupid they\nwill swallow anything they\nare fed\u201d. They argue that the\nmove is about an election \u2013\nthe Iraqi election due to take\nplace next year, which needs\na safe country and limited\nresistance so that Bush and\nBlair can chalk it up as a\nsuccess.\nThe Telegraph added its\nvoice, saying it was unlikely\nthat Blair was allowing the\nmove in order to help George\nBush, because it has hardly\nbeen reported on at all in the\nAmerican media.\nThe Telegraph believes that\nBlair has agreed the move\nfor much more dangerous\nreasons \u2013 because he himself believes that what he is\ndoing is right, and that he\nis doing all he can to finish\nthe job and secure his legacy.\nThe paper describes him as a\n\u201cwarrior-statesman, with fire\nin his eyes, determined to get\nhis way\u201d.\nThe Mirror interviewed\nsoldiers\u2019 parents who were\nfound to \u201cdistrust the motives\nfor sending their sons and\ndaughters into battle\u201d.\nThe state of mind of the\ntroops was a favourite topic.\nThe Sun claimed that they\nwere proud to be involved,\nquoting one who said:\n\u201cFrankly this regiment beat\nNapoleon, beat the Kaiser\nand it beat Hitler. For the\njocks of the Black Watch this\nis just the latest chapter in\nour history and just another\njob to be done\u201d.\nThey argued that all the\nhype over moving to the \u2018triangle of death\u2019 was needless\nhyperbole that did nothing\nexcept upset their families.\nBut then they would say\nthat, wouldn\u2019t they, argues\nThe Observer \u2013 they need\nto \u201ccrush feelings of regret\nbecause a lack of commitment could be fatal\u201d.\nThe Observer also made\nperhaps the most telling\npoint about the whole\nthing: regardless of whether or not Blair did make\nthe decision to send the troops\nin order to shore up Bush\u2019s\nsupport, what is most serious for the Prime Minister\nis that everyone \u201cimmediately assumed that he had\nan underhand reason\u201d. Trust\nin the Prime Minister, and\nin his wartime decision-making, appears to be at its\nlowest ebb.\nBlack Watch troops move to \u2018triangle of death\u2019\nReading the newspapers so you don\u2019t have to: Emily Gwyer looks at what the British press\nsaid about one of the week\u2019s biggest national news stories\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nImperial College lecturer Dr\nAndy Purvis became the new\nWorld Singles tiddlywinks\nchampion last Friday.\nDr Purvis, who works\nat Silwood Park in the\nDepartment of Biological\nSciences, won the 59th World\nSingles event at Queen\u2019s\nCollege, Cambridge.

    "content": "The exhibition showcasing works by\nthis year\u2019s Turner Prize finalists is\nnow open at the Tate Britain.\nThe Turner Prize honours the\nachievements of an outstanding art-ist, living and working in Britain, who\nis under the age of 50. Each year,\nnominations for the prize are invited\nfrom the public, based on artists\u2019\nwork exhibited during the preceding year. The shortlist (which, since\n1991, has consisted of four artists) is\nannounced by a jury a few months\nbefore the prize.\nThe prize is organized by the Tate,\nand since its inception in 1984 by a\ngroup called Patrons of the New Art,\nit has become the United Kingdom\u2019s\nmost publicised art award. The prize\nmoney this year is \u00a325,000 for the\nwinner and \u00a35,000 each for the three\nrunners-up. The prize is named after\nthe nineteenth century landscape\nartist JW Turner. It is not clear what\nwas the motivation for naming the\nprize after Turner, but the artist did\nleave a large fortune for the support\nof what he called \u2018decaying artists\u2019.\nThe will was never honoured.\nThe build-up to the announcement of the winner receives intense\nattention from many branches of the\nmedia each year, much of it criti-cal, addressing the questions \u201cwhat\nis art\u201d and \u201cis this really art\u201d. The\nartists themselves usually work in\nmodern forms, including unconventional sculpture and audiovisual\nmedia, though painters have also\nwon. The exhibition and prize rely on\ncommercial sponsorship. From 1987\nthis was provided by the company\nDrexel Burnham Lambert, whose\nwithdrawal led to the 1990 prize\nbeing cancelled. Channel 4 stepped\nin for 1991, doubled the prize money\nand supported the event with documentaries and live broadcasts of the\nprize-giving. This year, the sponsorship has been taken over by Gordon\u2019s\ngin with an increase in total prize\nmoney from \u00a320,000 to \u00a340,000.\nAlthough all works of art attract\ncritical commentaries from the\nexperts, the Turner Prize has earned\na reputation for some less formal\nattacks that have, in part, contributed to the wide coverage the prize\nreceives. In 1993, an organization\ncalled the K Foundation received\nmedia attention for awarding the\nAnti-Turner Prize, \u00a340,000 to be given\nto the \u2018worst artist in Britain\u2019, voted\nfrom the real Turner Prize\u2019s short-list. Rachel Whiteread, who won the\nreal prize, also won the anti-Turner\nPrize. She refused to accept the\nmoney at first, but changed her mind\nwhen she heard the cash was to be\nburned instead, and gave \u00a330,000 of\nit to artists in financial need and the\nother \u00a310,000 to the housing charity\nShelter.\nIn 1999 two artists, Jian Jun Xi\nand Yuan Cai, jumped onto Tracey\nEmin\u2019s work, My Bed, stripped to\ntheir underwear, and had a pillow\nfight. Police detained the two, who\ncalled their performance Two Naked\nMen Jump into Tracey\u2019s Bed.\nIn 1999, a pro-painting group\nof artists known as the Stuckists\nwas formed. They show particular\nantipathy towards the Turner Prize,\ndescribing it as an \u201congoing national\njoke\u201d and \u201ca state-funded advertising agency for Charles Saatchi\u201d.\nThey maintained that \u201cthe only artist who wouldn\u2019t be in danger of\nwinning the Turner Prize is Turner\u201d,\nconcluding that it \u201cshould be renamed The Duchamp Award for the\ndestruction of artistic integrity\u201d. In\n2002, Culture Minister Kim Howells\npinned the following statement to a\nboard in a room specially designated\nfor visitor\u2019s comments: \u201cIf this is the\nbest British artists can produce then\nBritish art is lost. It is cold mechani-cal, conceptual bullshit\u201d.\nThis year\u2019s finalists are Kutlug\nAtaman, Jeremy Deller, Langlands\n& Bell and Yinka Shonibare.\nAlthough the works exhibited at the\nTate Britain are only a small representation of those on which jury\u2019s\ndecision is made, they are a good\nreflection on the conceptual style of\nthe artists.\nAtaman\u2019s work entitled Twelve is\ncomprised of films in which six people describe their previous life, death\nand rebirth in minute detail. Filmed\nin an Arab community in southern\nTurkey that believes in reincarna-tion, the films are a modern form of\nthe ancient Arabic art of storytelling\nimmortalized in the Arabian Nights.\nThe title comes from the fact that six\npeople are narrating about six other\npeople, their previous incarnations,\nalthough to a causal observer the\nreason for the name Twelve may\nseem to arise more from the fact\nthat the screens on which the films\nare projected are viewable from both\nfront and rear and so look like 12\nfilms. The films are long, almost\none hour each, and it\u2019s impossible\nto enjoy this piece of work with a\nlimited supply of time. Although the\nmotivation for the work comes from\nthe artist\u2019s background in film-mak-ing, the films themselves are probably made with a hand-held camera\nin one take each and not extensively\nedited. To those who have not previously read or had explained to them\nwhat the people are talking about,\nit only looks like a jumble of home\nvideos with one person talking non-stop.\nDeller\u2019s work at the exhibition consists of a series of ten photographs\ntitled Five Memorials, a 23 minute\nvideo based on his time spent in\nTexas called Memory Bucket, a wall\npainting detailing a complex relationship between Acid House and\ntraditional Brass Band in a flow\nchart form titled The History of\nthe World, and a 13 minute film A\nSocial Parade of a pageant the artist organized in San Sebastian. Five\nMemorials is a photographic tribute\nto various events and persons that\nare related to present and near past\nBritish life. The photographs capture simple memorials but being so\nsimple their effect is striking. A simple little cycle shape, with no label,\nhung over a pole at the spot where a\ncyclist was killed last year. A bench\nplaced in a park in memory of Brian\nEpstein, the manager of The Beatles,\na plaque marking the site of riots\nbetween police and striking minors\nof 1984, another plaque marking the\ndeath of one of the demonstrators\nin the strike and one memorial to\nremember the arrival of first ship to\nbring Caribbean immigrants under\na state sponsored initiative. With\nthe exception of Five Memorials,\nDeller\u2019s other works are difficult to\ncomprehend and it\u2019s even more difficult to figure out what is artistic\nabout them.\nLanglands and Bell\u2019s works are\na result of their two weeks\u2019 visit to\nAfghanistan on commission for the\nImperial War Museum. Their works\non display include Frozen Sky, a slide\nshow of abbreviated names of the\nhuge number of Non Governmental\nOrganisations that they found based\nin Kabul; United Nations, an earlier\nneon work listing the airport abbreviations for various world cities; and\nHouse of Osama Bin Laden which is\na computer generated animation of\nan isolated and impoverished house\nwhich Bin Laden used for a few\nmonths. The animation is navigable\nusing a joystick just as in computer\ngames. However this house could be\nany house in Afghanistan and irrespective of the fact that Bin Laden\nused it or not the only significant\nthing about this piece of art is that\nit\u2019s a video game without any players\n(and anything to play with).\nThe works on display by Yinka\nShornibare include Maxa, a collection of various motifs on a common\nAfrican cloth; The Swing, a headless sculpture representing a celebrated eighteenth-century painting\nof a young woman kicking out her\nlegs; and Un Ballo in Maschera, (a\nMasked Ball), a film depicting the\nassassination of King Gustav III of\nSweden in 1792 through the medium\nof dance. There is no doubt that choreographic work in this film is excellent still one wonders if the work\nneeded to be awarded in a dance\ncompetition rather then as a work of\ncontemporary visual art.\nAlthough all these works have\ntheir own strengths and weakness-es, there are two things that are difficult to miss. First is that although\nthe criteria to be considered for the\nprize demand strong connections to\nBritain, the works selected hardly\nrelate to modern British life. Except\nfor Five Memorials, all works draw\ntheir inspiration from events that\nare either of international concern\nor utterly foreign to Britain. The second is the over whelming use of film\nmedia which is making it difficult to\nfigure out if the work is good for a\nfilm award, a documentary award or\na visual arts award. Arising from this\nfact is the question of the definition\nof art in itself.\nTheprizewinneristobeannounced\non December 9 and the exhibition\nwill continue until Christmas.\nSo, the Turner Prize: is it any good?\nDoes it serve any purpose whatso-ever? Does anyone like the art that\nis shortliststed for the prize? What\nsection of the public actually submits\nnominations for the silly thing, and\ndoes it make any difference to the\njudges\u2019 decisions what the public\nthinks?\nA lot of questions, but unfortunately this is mostly what the Turner\nPrize inspires in people. After all,\nwhen was the last time you ever\nheard anyone say anything in praise\nof the art on show? In fact, every\nyear all we ever hear is the eternal\nquestion of \u201cis this art?!\u201d Well, is it?\nAnyone care to hazard a guess?\nOf course, the definition of art can\nbe stretched to be as long as the\nproverbial piece of string. Freedom\nof expression in the name of art is all\nfine and well, but are there limits?\nShould there be limits and should\nthere be a designated body to set out\nand enforce these limits?\n\u25cf Your comments and views\non the Turner Prize and all\nother attempts at art are\nalways welcome\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 October 2004\n20\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBoneyard, 2004, by Langlands and Bell\n\u201cIf this is the best\nBritish artists can\nproduce then British\nart is lost.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 October 2004\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nNoughties beats and eighties pop\nRJD2 has been hailed as yet another sample maestro in the vein of DJ Shadow, but his\nsophomore record seems to be stuck in around 1984\n17\nALBUM REVIEW\nWith his commercial debut\nDeadringer, RJD2 (real name R\nJ Krohn) caused a stir among hip-sters and critics alike as they fell\nover themselves to try to pin the\n\u201cnew DJ Shadow\u201d label on him. His\nweighty beats and seriously efficient\nsampling toyed with both commercial hip-hop and Cut Chemist-style\nunderground.\nThe follow-up, the nostalgically\ntitled Since We Last Spoke, is a\nsomewhat confusing affair. RJ leaps\naround genres, styles and formats\nendlessly, often within the space of a\nsingle four-minute track, giving the\nrecord an air of uneasiness and dis-quiet. The title track is full of halting,\nstuttering silences between gritty\nguitars and a glorious, harmonising\nvocal; this conjures up images of\nmodern urban decay \u2013 boarded up\nbuildings and flyposting.\nWhereas Deadringer could feel\nimpersonal, almost robotic at times,\nSince We Last Spoke is warm,\nwelcoming, and at times, touch-ing. Someone\u2019s Second Kiss opens\nwith menancing, crackly piano\nover skittering, broken beats; the\nlush-sounding disco vocal slides in\nalmost unnoticed before the track\ndissolves into analogue, Moog bleep-ing. It\u2019s an awe-inspiring piece of\ndownbeat hip-hop. Clean Living is\nmellowed out seventies disco, with\nyet another perfect vocal sample:\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s life goes on / like a\nmelancholy song\u201d. RJ allows the\npiano sound from the original track\nto bleed through, before surprising\nyou with steel drums and wah-wah\nguitar; again, the inventiveness and\nsheer playfulness shines through.\nThe nostalgic feeling of the name\nextends itself into the record, most of\nwhich seems to be stuck in the early\neighties or late seventies, an era of\nhair-metal guitar solos, expensive\nanalogue synthesisers and gloriously over the top disco funk. Listen\nto 1976 and you\u2019re listening to the\nbest cop-show theme tune that was\nnever screened. Scratchy guitars,\nmotown horns and a stupidly funky\nbassline make me think of police\nhelicopters over LA, or cop chases\ndown alleys full of boxes. To All Of\nYou wouldn\u2019t seem out of place on\na compilation between Isaac Hayes\nand the late, great, Barry White, so\nauthentic is its sampling of black\nsoul love themes.\nOccasionally RJ seems to misjudge the level of cheesiness that\u2019s\ntolerable. Through The Walls pilfers\nevery dreadful eighties guitar band\nfor its palm-muted riff and awful,\nbreathy vocal; it almost sounds like\nit should be on the soundtrack to The\nWedding Singer. However, these\nmoments are few and far between.\nFor the most part, Since We Last\nSpoke is a triumph \u2013 an ambitious\nblend of hip-hop, IDM, funk, soul\nand just about every other genre\nyou care to name.\nAndrew Sykes\nMusic Editor\nRJD2: \u201cAh crap, I\u2019ve written another 70s cop-show theme tune.\u201d\nLIVE REVIEW\nDecent bands? At the Union?\nSurprising, I know.\nThis gig gained so little publicity,\nit was a miracle that anyone showed\nup at all. Boxer Rebellion alone are\ncapable of drawing a big enough\ncrowd to fill the Water Rats, and\neven NME was all over their single Watermelon. For Christ\u2019s sake,\nthey\u2019re signed to Alan McGee\u2019s\nPoptones label. Since this was an\n\u201cevents\u201d night at the Union, the not-too-friendly bouncers were out in\nforce to make sure those scum of the\nearth, non-Imperial types, were kept\nout. A couple of our friends showed\nup after I had already entered the\nUnion and, being fairly big Boxer\nRebellion fans, I went out to try\nand sign them in as my \u2018guests\u2019. I\nwas treated as if I was trying to get\na pair of known criminals into the\npremises.\nThat\u2019s enough ranting about the\nUnion for this review. It\u2019s actually\na great place to watch bands: the\nstage is huge, the beer is cheap, and\nthe soundsystem is very respect-able.\nUnfortunately, we managed to miss\nthe first band on the bill, but headed\ninto dBs to watch Headway. Looking\nlike the generic, straight outta\nCamden indie band, I was expecting\na set of mid-paced, melodic pop. What\nwe got instead was huge choruses,\nguitar wigouts and some seriously\nmeaty tunes \u2013 imagine, if you will,\nthe hugely underrated Easyworld\njamming with Doves. Although the\ncrowd was typically stoic, towards\nthe end of the set I glanced around to\nsee heads nodding and feet tapping.\nUnder Control, despite its Strokes\naping title, was a blast of searing,\ndriving pop, the singer\u2019s vocals soaring over a suitably large hook.\nHeadway did the rock finish, then\ntook their gear apart themselves and\nlifted it offstage. This band should\nnot have to hump their own amps\nout of the back door \u2013 while bands\nlike Razorlight and the awful Jet\nhave line after line of column inches\npraising them, gems like Headway\nget two lines in the back of the Metro\nin the listings section. Sadly, this is\nwhat happens when the mainstream\nmusic press focuses more on image\nthan actual ability.\nBoxer Rebellion certainly had a lot\nto live up to. Having only one guitarist compared to Headway\u2019s two, I\nwondered how much variety there\nwould be in the set. Thankfully, any\npreconceptions I had were completely destroyed within about 30 seconds\nof the opening song. Their sound\nis a based on swirling, feedbacking\nguitar lines, somewhat reminiscent\nof Radiohead. Where Radiohead\nwould insert a lengthy verse, Boxer\nRebellion insert lots and lots of\nnoise. Walls of noise, indeed, seem\nto be their speciality. At some points,\nthe drummer was allowed to let rip\nwith some of the best drumming I\u2019ve\nheard since Oceansize \u2013 thundering\nsnares and tons of cymbals, sending\nthe songs into the same post-rock\nterritory.\nFinishing with the utterly destructive Watermelon, which is basically\nbuilt around a two-note guitar harmonic and evolves into a rage-filled\nmaelstrom, Boxer Rebellion left\nme shouting for more. I can understand why Alan McGee signed them\non sight \u2013 they have an incredibly\nenthralling sound that draws you in\nand spits you out feeling exhausted\nand sweaty.\nAndrew Sykes\nBands! At the Union!\nWith very little or no advertising, Boxer Rebellion and Headway manage to take over Friday\nnight in dBs with their sweeping, anthemic songs\nBoxer Rebellion\ndBs\nHHHHI\nBoxer Rebellion\u2019s guitarist demonstrates his magical fringe\nBoxer Rebellion: powerful, swirling, and scarf-wearing\nRJD2\nSince We Last Spoke\nDefinitive\nHHHHI\n\n"

    "content": "Alfie likes to play it cool. He\u2019s a\nslick operator who spends his days\nchasing after a series of glamorous\nwomen who cross his path during\nhis daily adventures in Manhattan.\nAn Englishman abroad, Alfie, played\nby Jude Law, is a charming and affable character who manages to woo\nwomen back to his \u201chumble digs\u201d\nthrough his good looks, fashionable\nattire and cheeky smile.\nThe film is amusing, if somewhat\nshallow in terms of plot and character development, but manages to\nplease the audience with its beautiful shots of New York, coupled with\nits pretty women \u2013 Sienna Miller,\nMarisa Tomei and Susan Sarandon\namongst others. Alfie takes it upon\nhimself to learn a new word every\nday, from \u2018ironic\u2019 to \u2018plethora\u2019, which\ndoes indeed describe his love life\nand his altogether hedonistic exist-ence.\nAlfie tells the story of a woman-iser who is afraid of commitment,\nwho unashamedly moves from one\nwoman to another and seems to\nuse various women for his differing needs. Nicky, played by Sienna\nMiller (who made her film debut\nrecently in Layer Cake) takes the\nrole of the party-girl; Marisa Tomei\nplays the little wife-like girl providing the home-cooked dinners and\nfamily warmth; and Susan Sarandon,\nwho plays a fifty-something Mrs\nRobinson-esque lover, combines sex\nappeal with humour. Indeed, one of\nthe most amusing parts of the film\nis the scene where Sarandon, after\ngiving Law a rather strong cocktail,\ntells him that \u201cabsinthe makes the\nheart grow fonder!\u201d\nAlfie is quite a little philosopher\nand makes clear to us his views\non the dangers of women, saying\nthat \u201cif they don\u2019t get you one way\nthey get you another\u201d. One thinks\nthat perhaps Alfie\u2019s word of the day\nshould be \u2018philanderer\u2019, albeit in the\nmost gentlemanly of ways.\nAt one point Alfie seems to have\ndecided on changing his ways and\ntells us that he has made a New\nYear\u2019s resolution with regard to\nwomen, but then it turns out that\nhis new resolution is simply to \u201caim\nhigher\u201d, rather than anything more\nethically sound. Invariably, there is\na moral message at the end with\nAlfie\u2019s descent into misery showing that there is a price to pay for\nsuch a responsibility-free, reckless\nlifestyle, but one wonders how much\nthat it is to do with Hollywood\u2019s dislike of the \u2018bad\u2019 guy, or in this case\nthe \u2018naughty\u2019 guy, getting away with\nit than anything else.\nAlfie is a remake of the 1966 original that had Michael Caine acting as\nthe working class tough-guy hero.\nThe director of the remake, Charles\nShyer, has decided to change Alfie\u2019s\ncharacter to fit in with a more 21st\ncentury reality, with Jude Law being\nmore home-counties than East End,\nmore cheeky than sleazy and more\nlike someone from Friends than a\nrough cockney biker type. However,\nit works well and while some points\nare clearly unbelievable, like Alfie\u2019s\ndesigner wardrobe which he could ill\nafford on his wages as a limo-cum-taxi driver, overall the story retains\na certain charm and humour.\nWhile the film does have some\nserious, almost melancholy scenes,\nit would not be unfair to call it\ncomic with a few real gems\nincluding the scene where Alfie\ngets his nether parts checked and\npoked at by a rather camp German\ndoctor by the name of Miranda.\nThe film is funny, enjoyable,\nstylish and worth spending your\nprecious 103 minutes of freedom on.\nIf nothing else, the soundtrack\nperformed by Mick Jagger should\nentertain the more musically minded amongst you.\nDavid Shalom\nAlfie the great?\nA philosophical womanizer is forced to question his seemingly carefree existence\nAlfie\nDirector: Charles Shyer\nStarring: Jude Law, Susan Sarandon,\nSienna Miller, Marisa Tomei\nLength: 103 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHII\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nWhose side will you choose?\nIt has been a long time coming, but\nfinally the film that has been nothing but an elusive dream for many a\ngaming, comic book and film fan has\narrived. Alien vs Predator (AVP) is\nnow on our screens.\nAt long last, the two greatest horror sci-fi titans \u2013 the acid-blooded,\nanimalistic aliens and the brutal,\nmerciless predators \u2013 have been\nbrought together to battle it out for\nthe ultimate prize: Earth.\nSet in the 21st century, the story\ntells of the ever present Weyland\nCorporation and its founder Charles\nWeyland (Lance Henriksen) discovering an ancient pyramid below\nthe ice of an isolated Arctic island.\nWanting to discover more, Weyland\ntakes a team of scientists out into\nthe frozen wastes. The pyramid,\nhowever, turns out to be a battle\nground where every 100 years two\nmenacing alien races meet to wage\nwar. Of course, when the unsuspecting humans arrive they are caught\nin the middle of a deadly battle and\nhave to pick a side knowing that victory for either could ultimately lead\nto the demise of the whole planet\u2019s\npopulation.\nNow this film requires no prior\nknowledge of either the aliens or\nthe predators, which is good in some\nways because it means that it can be\nwatched by anyone with a penchant\nfor horror/sci-fi/fantasy/action. For\nthose of us who would like to be\nreminded a little bit, here\u2019s a quick\nhistory: the aliens first appeared\non the big screen in Alien in 1979\nwhen they battled against Ellen\nRipley (Sigourney Weaver) to make\nit back to Earth and colonise it.\nUsing humans as incubators for\ntheir young and/or food, they were\nseemingly invincible and kept coming back, appearing in subsequent\nfilms Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien\nResurrection. With acid for blood\nand two heads, these aliens were\nthe stuff nightmares.\nThe predators, on the other\nhand are a more civilised race of\nman hunters, killing for pleasure\nrather than necessity and collecting human skulls as trophies.\nThey met their match, however, in\nArnold Schwarzenegger in a South\nAmerican jungle in Predator and\nwere fought by a resistant Danny\nGlover in Predator 2.\nSo how does this film measure\nup to the spirit of both these well\nknown franchises? In keeping with\nthe Alien theme there is a kick-ass female, Alexa Woods (Sanaa\nLathan) who leads the survivors\nout of danger, as well as a familiar\nface from three of the four previous Alien films, Henriksen (former-ly the android Bishop) appearing\nas Weyland. The film also expands\non the knowledge of the predator\nrace, as we see their capabilities\nas the ultimate hunters tested by\ntheir hunting the ultimate prey, the\naliens.\nNow AVP is not the kind of movie\nthat relies on its background story\nor its witty and intense dialogue.\nInstead it\u2019s comprised of action, a\nbit of gore and some fluorescent\nblood. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking\nfor, all packaged nicely into a neat\nhour and a half, then it\u2019s not a bad\nfilm.\nDirected by Paul S Anderson, who\nbrought us Event Horizon, Soldier\nand Resident Evil, it lacks a bit of\nbasic credibility, but then most horror films do. The special effects are\nmore than adequate \u2013 they\u2019re actually awesome \u2013 and the cataclysmic battles between the aliens and\nthe predators are definitely worth\nwatching.\nAll in all, it\u2019s not going to win any\nOscars but it is exactly what its\nsays on the tin \u2013 Alien vs Predator\n\u2013 and that will definitely please a lot\nof people.\nMandirassa Osakonor\nAlien vs Predator\nDirector: Paul Anderson\nStarring: Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova,\nLance Henriksen\nLength: 101 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHII\n\u201c...amusing, if\nsomewhat shallow\nin terms of plot and\ncharacter development...\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 October 2004 23\nParty girl Sienna Miller and womanizer Jude Law in Alfie\n\u201cIt\u2019s you!

Secondly,\nEWB are seeking to raise\nawareness and satiate curiosity about international\ndevelopment within univer-sities. Finally, the organization encourages students to\npartake in research projects\nto develop appropriate engineering solutions to developing world problems.\nThe geographical nature\nof Nepal and long-standing\npolitical turmoil have led to\nthe creation of several infra-structural deficiencies and\nchallenges, one of which is\nthe distribution of electric-ity. Due to the mountainous\nterrain and dispersed villag-es, it has not been economically feasible for the grid to\nexpand much further beyond\nthe cities of Kathmandu and\nPokhara, nor is any serious expansion planned for\nthe next ten years. This has\nmeant that the majority of\nNepalese rural communities\ndoes not and will not have\nany access to electricity.\nHowever, people have begun\nto respond to this problem\nby adopting decentralized\nmicro-solar power systems.\nOver the course of five years,\nNepal has seen approximately 50,000 solar systems being\ninstalled throughout the\ncountry, and this trend continues to gain popularity.\nThe Himalayan Light\nFoundation has been at the\nforefront of the rapid growth\nof this alternative energy\nsource, and continues to\ndevelop the technology to\nmeet the needs of Nepali\ncommunities. In co-ordi-nation with this organisa-tion, the Engineers Without\nBorders students were able\nto pioneer computer classes\nin village schools and the use\nof solar power in community factories in Baglung and\nGorkha.\nYou can hear more about\nthese students and their work\nin Nepal in a talk to be given\ntonight by EWB Imperial students who have spent their\nsummers in different parts\nof the world participating in\nseveral development-related\nprojects.\n\u25cf The EWB talk takes\nplace tonight from 6pm\nin room 208 of the Civil\nEngineering building.\nFor more information,\nvisit www.ewb-uk.org\nImperial students work\nwith solar power in Nepal\nImperial College students working on a solar power installation in Nepal\nThe Samaritans: here to listen and support\nIt\u2019s a cold, wet Friday night.\nYou\u2019ve been dumped the previous evening. You\u2019re struggling to meet an essay dead-line. And your flatmates are\nasking for rent money you\nhaven\u2019t got. You feel desper-ate, almost overwhelmed.\nYou\u2019re having despairing\nfeelings you\u2019ve never experienced before...\nIf you found yourself in\nthis situation, who could you\nturn to at 3am? Who would\nbe available for you to talk\nto? Where would you find a\ncaring listener in the middle of the night with whom\nto share your feelings? Who\nwould want to even listen to\nyour problems?\nThere are places to go for\nthis kind of help, but not all of\nthem are available whenever\nyou might need them. The\nStudent Advice Service, the\nStudent Counselling Service\nand Nightline all offer sup-port, but what happens if they\nare busy, or you have to make\nan appointment, or it\u2019s during the College holidays? Who\nwould you turn to then?\nThe answer is to call\nSamaritans.Thelocalnumber\nis 020 7734 2800, or you can\nring the national number,\n08457 90 90 90.\nSamaritans provide a confidential helpline that operates 24/7/365. They are there\nfor people in distress, going\nthrough a crisis and thinking of harming themselves\nor possibly taking their own\nlives. But we also hope to hear\nfrom people before they feel\nclose to the edge \u2013 when they\nfeel distressed, confused, iso-lated, misunderstood. As one\nSamaritan put it: \u201cOur role\nis to respond to anyone going\nthrough a difficult time, feeling depressed, or just struggling to cope.\u201d\nWhat Samaritans offer is\nsomeone to talk to, someone\nwho will share the burden,\nsomeone who will listen without judging. They are not\ncounsellors, therapists, or\nadvisors, just ordinary people\noffering empathy and human\nunderstanding.\n\u201cSamaritans work on the\nprinciple that talking things\nthrough can make it easier to\nfind a way out of distress. We\ndo not judge or give advice,\nwe allow people to work out\ntheir own way forward.\u201d\nSamaritans recognise that\nit is often difficult to talk\nabout sensitive issues or\npersonal traumas, and they\nknow that telephoning can\nbe painfully hard for some\ncallers. However, if you wish,\nyou don\u2019t even have to make\nverbal contact, as Samaritans\nalso have a confidential email\nservice offering support. You\ncan email jo@samaritans.org\nand someone will respond\nwithin 24 hours.\nFor students with access\nto central London, there is\nalso a drop-in service that\noperates from 9am to 9pm at\n46 Marshall Street, in Soho.\nThis provides the opportunity\nof talking to a Samaritan volunteer face-to-face. Central\nLondon Samaritans also has\nvolunteers who speak many\ndifferent languages, and\nthere is a line dedicated for\nJapanese speakers on 020\n7287 5493.\nBut, as one Samaritan\nexplains, \u201cIt may not be you\nthat is experiencing distress\nor facing a crisis. It may be a\nfellow student. What we hope\nis that friends will pick up\nsigns of distress \u2013 such as\nchanges in patterns of behaviour \u2013 and let them know\nabout the Samaritans. That\nthey can call us; that we are\nhere to listen.\u201d\n\u25cf In Britain, more people die\nevery year by suicide than in\nroad accidents.\n\u25cf Every two hours someone\nin the UK succeeds in taking\nhis/her life.\n\u25cf Two people under 25 die by\nsuicide every day.\n\u25cf Every hour three young\npeople self harm.\n\u25cf Many of these people are\nstudents, struggling to cope\nwith the pressures of being at\ncollege or university.\nSamaritans can be contacted 24 hours a day by telephone and email.

Over 350 students came along to learn\nhow they could get involved.\nPiers Robinson, Student\nBusiness Mentor, explained\nthe format of the competition.\nThe Challenge is open to all\nImperial College students,\nundergraduate and post-graduate, and is run by the\nEntrepreneurship Centre in\nthe Tanaka Business School.\nStudents do not need to have\nprior business or commercial\nexperience to enter. Previous\nwinners have come from a\nvariety of departments.\nThe \u2018Ideas Challenge\u2019, the\nfirst part of the competition,\nruns this term and asks for a 2-3 page summary of a business\nidea. Ten \u00a31,000 prizes and\nten \u00a3250 prizes are awarded\nto the winners at this stage.\nIn the Spring term, the \u2018New\nBusiness Challenge\u2019 offers\nstudents the opportunity to\npresent a full business plan\nfor a chance to win the first\nprize of \u00a325,000 in cash and\nservices, one of two runners\nup prizes of \u00a35,000 in cash\nand services, or a finalist cash\nprize of \u00a31,000.\nKindle Solutions \u2013 better\nknown as James Barclay,\nJames Arnold and Paul\nAndrew, three final year\nmechanical engineering students\u2013sharedtheirexperiences of entering the Challenge\nlastyear.LagerServ,withtheir\nidea of a time-saving device\nfor pouring beer, proved to be\na very popular choice with the\nstudents!\nSuccessful entrepreneur\nDan Germain, one of the\nfounders of Innocent drinks,\nprovided the inspiration for\nthe evening. The creators of\nInnocentwerethreecityworkers who left their jobs in 1998\nto start up a company selling\nhealth drinks. They bought\n\u00a3500 worth of fruit, turned it\ninto smoothies and sold them\nat a music festival in London\nfrom a stall with a big sign\nabove saying \u2018Do you think\nwe should give up our jobs to\nmake these smoothies?\u2019 They\nput out a bin saying \u2018YES\u2019 and\na bin saying \u2018NO\u2019, and asked\npeople to put the empty bottle\nin the right bin. At the end of\nthe weekend, the \u2018YES\u2019 bin\nwas full and Innocent, now a\ncompany with an \u00a318m rev-enue, was born.\nTeams who have taken\npart in the Entrepreneurs\u2019\nChallenge have been successful London-wide as well\nas in international business\nplan competitions, proving\nImperial\u2019s students to be\namong the best at developing\nand presenting ideas. Some\nhave also gone on to raise\ninvestment capital to make\ntheir businesses a reality.\nThe competition attracts\ncompanies such as McKinsey,\nIBM, Psion, Shell, HP\n, HSBC,\nBarclays Capital, Amadeus\nCapital and Innocent Drinks\nto sponsor or pass on their\nexpertise to our students,\nmeaning that entrants have\na wealth of experience available to them as they put their\nbusiness plans together.\nWeekly presentations take\nplace every Thursday 6-7pm\nin LT1 of the Tanaka Business\nSchool to support those entering the competition.

Three\nquarters of students now work to\ntry to make ends meet. Working students experience similar problems\nand organisations such as the TUC\nare campaigning for a better deal.\nYou have rights which can help\nimprove your working conditions\nand protect you from danger and\ndiscrimination whatever your boss\nsays. In fact, new laws mean that in\naddition to your basic rights, things\nhave just got better for all working\npeople, including part-timers, temps\nand casuals.\nYou can join a union to get advice\nand support at work when you\nneed it and to win a better deal\nin your workplace. The majority of\nstudents are not in unionised workplaces and are not members of\nunions. This means you\u2019re likely to\nbe worse off than most other workers and more open to exploitation.\nBut you have just as much right to\njoin a union as everyone else, whatever your job. In fact, given the kind\nof work you do and the attitude of\nemployers to young/casual workers,\nyou\u2019re more likely to need a union\nthan most.\nIf you have any queries relating to\nthis article or would like information\non your rights at work please contact\nNigel Cooke, the Student Adviser, on\n020 7594 8060 or advice@ic.ac.uk.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nNovember is training month!\nImperial College Union training\noffers you the opportunity to learn\nnew skills, improve upon those that\nyou already have and gain knowledge in new areas. For this reason\nwe have designated November as\nthe month to \u201cACQUIRE\u201d new skills\nby offering a variety of training sessions free to all Imperial students.\nPreviously, although the Union\noffered training, it has not been\nwidely taken up, despite being a\ndevelopment opportunity that we\nare able to offer students. This year,\na full list of training sessions is available on noticeboards in the Union\nbuilding and in the East Wing basement of Beit Quad. To book a place,\nyou will need to come to the Student\nActivities Centre in the East Wing\nbasement.\nIf places run out then we will have\na waiting list system and possibly\nput on extra sessions if there sufficient demand. Although the sessions\nare free, we do require you to give a\n\u00a310 deposit which will be refunded\nto you on the day of the session. As\nspaces are limited, this is to ensure\nthat those signed up do take their\nplaces. Training sessions are either\nin the evening, on Wednesday afternoons or during lunchtimes (please\nsee timetable for further details),\nwhich we hope will fit in with your\nCollege day.\nThe training sessions include\nthose by the Imperial Volunteer\nCentre, sessions specifically geared\nto academic representatives, and a\nvariety of personal advice, training\nand club and society opportunities.\nIncluded in club and society training (more information on which can\nbe sought from your CSC chair or\nFaculty Union president), we will be\nrunning sessions about organising\nevents. This will cover budgeting\nand other financial issues through\nto advice about planning and preparation and how the Union can assist\nwith such events. We hope that this\nwill be particularly good both for\nthose who have had little experience in organising events for their\nclubs as well as those who wish to\nimprove on previous years.\nAnother key session for clubs\nand societies is sponsorship, where\nclubs will be given advice about the\nbest ways to gain support for their\nactivities, how to go about doing this,\nwhich organisations to target and\nhow it can benefit them. During the\nsession, clubs will meet the Union\u2019s\nmarketing manager who, with her\nknowledge of the area, is going to\nbe increasingly available to assist\nclubs and societies in all aspects of\nsponsorship and marketing.\nThere will also be a variety of\npersonal development sessions covering public speaking, stress man-agement, assertiveness and time\nmanagement. These are all important areas and perfect opportunities\nto develop yourself and learn new\nskills.\nThe Union Advice Service will be\noffering advice sessions such as\ncoping with debt \u2013 regrettably an\nessential one for students!\nSo do take the opportunity to take\nadvantage of the training sessions\navailable, and ACQUIRE some new\nskills.\n\u25cf Sameena Misbahuddin\u2019s remit is\nto oversee the financial aspects of\nthe Union, including club and society finance, as well as the Union\u2019s\nservices.

Contact dpcs@ic.ac.uk.\nSAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(FINANCE & SERVICES)\n& RICHARD WALKER\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(CLUBS & SOCIETIES)\nImperial College is often referred\nto as a \u201cresearch-led\u201d university.\nUndergraduates are told in lengthy\nsermons (which usually also remind\nus that Imperial is a \u201cworld-class\ninstitution\u201d) that this has a direct,\nbeneficial effect on the quality of\nour teaching, and that we should be\neternally grateful. But has anyone\nstopped to think about what this\nmeans?\nEssentially, the people who teach\nus are primarily here to research,\nand, from the benefit of their\naccrued wisdom in their chosen\nfield, they lecture us. They don\u2019t, of\ncourse, undertake this sterling work\nby themselves \u2013 they are assisted\nby over 2,000 PhD students. This\nis one type of postgraduate study;\nthe other is the taught Masters and\nthere are slightly more of these.\nBetween them, they make up over a\nthird of our student body.\nOne of the Union\u2019s primary aims\nis to represent our students to the\nCollege and to external bodies.\nCurrently, I believe we are doing\nthat pretty well in the undergraduate world. We have a well-estab-lished system of representatives\nat year, department, Faculty Union\nand Imperial College Union levels,\nwith clearly defined formal reporting structures to ensure the effective flow of communication. OK, it\nisn\u2019t perfect, but it works. However,\nin the postgraduate world, things\ndon\u2019t always work so well. It appears\nthat, whilst representation is working well at a local level, the networks\nare not in place in the same way as\nthey are for undergraduate reps.\nWhat this means in effect is that\nthe Union is being asked to represent the views of certain groups of\nstudents to important College meet-ings, where decisions concerning\nthe future of courses are taken, and\nwe are not always able to do that\neffectively. I am going to change\nthat.\nFirstly, though, let\u2019s have a look\nat life as a postgrad at Imperial\nCollege. It can be (I am told) quite\na lonely existence, particularly for\nthose students who have not been\nhere before, and who therefore do\nnot know how to access the lively\nsocial life we can enjoy. Research\nstudents do not always start in\nOctober and will therefore not get\na proper induction; postgrads are\noften neglected by their departmental societies and Faculty Unions,\nwhich tend to be mostly run by\nundergrads. For Masters students,\nat least they attend lectures (some-times at the same time as under-grads), whereas research students\ncan sometimes feel quite isolated,\nspending most of their lives in their\nlabs then going home at the end of\nthe day. They are not always aware,\nfor example, of the huge range of\nclubs and societies that the Union\noffers to make life more interesting,\nor about the range of bars and meeting places around College. At the\nend of the day, it takes two to tango\nand, whilst we are trying to reach\nout to all our students, you can take\na horse to water but you can\u2019t make\nit drink.\nSo, what is my point? Well, I\nbelieve that if we engaged more\npostgraduates in student activities,\nthey may begin to get more involved\nwith the whole issue of representa-tion, which, as I have pointed out, I\nam most keen to address.\nBut perhaps I am being na\u00efve.\nMaybe postgrads think of representation in terms of complaining\nabout lecturers\u2019 poor handwriting\nor incomprehensible accent, as\nis often the case for undergrads.\nWell, postgraduate representation\ncould be more than that \u2013 maybe\nyou would like more input into the\nsorts of training and personal development you are offered, perhaps\nto better prepare you for confer-ences? Perhaps you see the job of\nthe rep as a conduit of information\nbetween you and the College, letting\nyou know about interesting events,\nimportant facts, or exciting oppor-tunities? Well, either way, if you feel\nunderrepresented at the moment,\nthen say something! If you have\na rep, let them know! If you don\u2019t,\ntell me!\nThere are many challenges that\nwe are going to have to address, but\nI need your help \u2013 I have not been a\npostgraduate at Imperial, so I need\nall the insight I can get into how to\nsolve the question of postgraduate\ninvolvement with the Union. To this\nend, I shall be gathering together\npeople with experience in represen-tation, so that we can find the way\nforward. If you have any sugges-tions, please get in touch.\n\u25cf Sam Rorke is the Deputy\nPresident (Education and Welfare)\nof Imperial College Union. His remit\nis to oversee academic affairs, wel-fare, accommodation and student\ndevelopment, and ensure that students\u2019 views on these issues are\neffectively communicated to the\nCollege.

Aiding the cause was\nthe fact that the opposition\nwere Kings 2nds, whose captain sent Shatters a text message at 3am the previous day\nsaying he only had nine players but was good for the game.\nThey actually arrived before\nImperial, but with a pathetic\neleven players, including a\ngloveless goalkeeper. Oh yes,\nthe signs were good.\nThe game kicked off at 2pm\non a perfect, slick surface, and\nquickly settled into a pattern\nof Imperial dominance. All\nover the pitch Imperial were\nfirst to the ball, stronger in\nthe challenge and cultured on\nthe ball. Five in midfield with\nBooth and Hideki hugging the\ntouchlines worked a treat,\nand Imperial retained excellent possession. Numerous\nchances were created in the\nfirst half, a couple falling to\nJohn Scott, who ran onto\nthe ball well but appeared\nto be missing his shooting\nboots as the \u2018keeper hung on\nboth times. Perhaps the best\neffort that went begging fell to\nHideki who, after some lovely\nslick passing, cut inside his\nman to leave the goal at his\nmercy, but again the King\u2019s\nkeeper pulled off the save.\nFrustration was starting to\nset in when, just after the half\nhour, Imperial won a corner,\nwhich was delivered from the\nright by Hideki. It flashed dangerously across the goal and\nreached a fresh air shot from\nAdam before finally landing\non Caruso\u2019s head. The ball\nhit the bar, hit the \u2018keeper\nand went in. One-nil Imperial.\nThis remained the score at\nhalf-time.\nOn came Leon for the\ninjured Adam and, ten minutes later, Perry for Scott. The\nsecond half was in general a\nslightly scrappier affair. While\nImperial were on top, the fluency wasn\u2019t as good as the\nfirst half. However, as King\u2019s\npushed forward, there were\nopportunities aplenty at the\nother end. About 15 minutes\ninto the half, probably the\nbest move of the game produced the second goal. Dom\nplayed a lovely chip to Leon\nwho pulled the ball back bypassing Perry to find a free\nHideki who curled the ball\ninto the far corner. Two-nil.\nThree-nil came courtesy of\nan own goal resulting from a\nPerrycorner.Furtherchances\ncame frequently as players\ntired and Perry helped himself to two goals. His first was\na mazy run from the halfway line, skipping past two\nplayers and the \u2018keeper. His\nsecond was a great turn and\nshot having received the ball\nfrom Leon.\nFive-nil to Imperial, and\ndespite having almost nothing to do, Matty pulled off a\ncouple of super saves during\nthe game to ensure the clean\nsheet. Right, we\u2019re all off to\nLuton on the fun bus.\nFOOTBALL\nThirds thump King\u2019s\nGKT Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 5\nBy Michael Nicholson\nOK, it wasn\u2019t against our own\nmedics, but a five-nil thrashing of the medics from GKT\nwas still a sweet result.\nThere was one change from\nthe team that drew with RVC,\nwith Jai coming in up front in\nplace of Dave who dropped to\nthe bench. As usual, Imperial\nmade a slow start and the\nspeedy GKT striker was causing problems by hanging on\nthe last man and outpacing\nthe back four to balls over\nthe top.\nVanni produced a captain\u2019s\nperformance and made\na couple of great saves to\nkeep things level. Imperial\nthough began to find their\nfeet, with Chris looking particularly dangerous down the\nleft. Their dominance began\nto tell, and Jai opened his\naccount for the season to put\nImperial one up with a neat\nleft-footed finish after great\nholding play from Shwin.\nThe second goal came from\nan unlikely source when\nEd popped up in the box to\nfinish well after more good\nwork from Shwin. Chris then\nbagged a deserved brace.\nThe final touch was added\nby Ant, who had an outstanding game and produced a pinpoint shot which lobbed the\n\u2018keeper and dropped into the\nright hand corner of the goal.\nThat makes it four points\nout of six for the Fourths. Big\nup the boys. Well played!\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 2\nSt Mary\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st 9\nBy Cindy Drinnan\nThe ladies\u2019 first team put in a\nstrongeffortagainstStMary\u2019s\nand were not disappointed\nwith this result against a\nteam that has recently been\ndemoted from the BUSA\nPremier League.\nDespite losing the game, the\nteam did not feel outplayed.\nSt Mary\u2019s seemed to rely on\na couple of strong players to\ndominatetheirgame.Number\n12 in particular appeared to\nhave borrowed Marion Jones\u2019\nlegs for the day.\nOur captain, Yoda, kept\nup enthusiasm with helpful coaching from the back,\ndespite nearly being taken\nout by a flying ball in the\nfirst five minutes of the\ngame! Howard and Flush\nwere strong in defence, as\nwas Pasty. Moonie, this time\nwith her clothes on, worked\nwell on the left with Womble\nand Spellcheck. Tandem\nrode, I mean ran, non-stop\non the right hand side, often\ngetting the ball out wide to\nChardonnay, who used the\npasses well.\nGoal scorers for Imperial\nwere Embryo and Anticlimax,\nwho on this occasion clearly\nchose not to live up to her\nname. Man of the match\nwent to our star goalkeeper\nSpanner, who put in a very\nconfident performance and\nsuccessfully tried out her new\ndiving techniques!\nStay tuned for updates on\nnaked hockey, which will be\nbrought to you by Moonie and\nTandem as a spectacular fundraising event.\nThe ladies would like to wish\na belated Happy 21st Birthday\nto Tyson, and a speedy recovery to her brother.\nHOCKEY\nHockey firsts\nface tough\nopposition\nFourths give medics a\ndamn good thrashing\nSponsored by\nGKT Men\u2019s 1st 14\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 26\nBy Mike Hicks\nFor our second game of the\nseason, Imperial College\nUnion Rugby Club\u2019s first XV\ntravelled away to GKT at\nCobham.\nArriving in plenty of time,\nunlike last year, we were all\nfeeling confident of a good\nperformance. This showed in\nthe first 15 minutes when we\nscored three tries, the best-coming from Alex \u2018yank tank\u2019\nO\u2019Rourke on the wing following some great hands in the\nbacks after a well worked lin-eout (19-0).\nUnfortunately, with the\ngame looking like it should\nend in a cricket score, we\ntook our foot off the pedal and\nallowed GKT to come back\ninto the match. Following\nsome sustained pressure on\nour 22, some careless penalties crept back in from last\nweek and suddenly they had\nkicked themselves onto the\nscoreboard (19-3).\nWith their heads now up,\nGKT came at us hard and\nsome miscommunication at a\nscrum on our own line allowed\nthem to score a soft try just\nbefore half time (19-8).\nAfter a few gentle words\nof encouragement during the\nbreak, most of which can\u2019t be\nprinted here, we came out\nin the second half trying to\nrecreate some of the magic of\nthe first 15 minutes.\nGKT must have had the\nsame treatment, as they also\ncame out fired up, leading\nto better rugby from both\nteams.\nDuring the second half,\nGKT kicked another two penalties to bring them within\nfive points (19-14). With the\npressure now on, we raised\nour game again and after a\nfailed clearance from GKT\u2019s\n22, Higgins fed the ball to\nSpencer, then Raph danced\nhis way through the defence\nto score. The game was now\nsealed at 26-14.\nMan of the match went to\nfull back Andy Towers for\nhis all-round presence at the\nback, while other notable performances came from Peddar,\nstepping into scrum half, and\nthe \u2018yank tank\u2019 on the wing.\nNext week we face league\nnewcomers King\u2019s, and going\non current form we should\neasily make it three out of\nthree.\nRUGBY\nRVC Women\u2019s 1st 19\nWye Women\u2019s 1st 0\nBy Suzanne Horn\nThe warriors of Wye women\u2019s\nrugby team marched onto the\npitch on a beautiful Sunday\nafternoon, but the girls were\nnot there to enjoy the sunshine \u2013 they were there to\nwin!\nWye played a valiant first\nhalf, with the girls called most\nof the shots after retaining\nthe majority of possession. An\noutstanding performance by\nour gutsy hooker made sure\nthat Wye kept the ball by winning opposing scrums despite\nthe weight disadvantage. This\ndeservedly gave our hooker\n\u2018woman of the match\u2019.\nAnother forward to be mentioned must be Ninja, whose\nblinding tackles shook the\nground and put any attack\nto a quick end. Even Martin\nJohnson would have winced\nif he had been watching from\nthe touchline!\nJackie got up close and personal with one of the Vet girls,\nshowing them how truly tough\nand brutal this side can be.\nThe score was nearly made\neven by a storming run from\nHetts, made possible from a\nlineout set move on the five\nyard line, but unfortunately\nthe try was disallowed. Better\nluck next time.\nRVC\u2019s size slowly prevailed throughout the second\nhalf, as Wye\u2019s legs became\ntired, leading to a couple of\nunlucky tries being conceded.\nHowever, this did not deter\nLil, in her first match at full\nback, from nailing a critical\ntry saving tackle.\nIn spite of this, the girls will\nbe back here with a vengeance next year and will be\nsure to bring along something to threaten the seagulls\nin case they make a repeat\nappearance.

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nCargo is possibly a club that has\nescaped your attention thus far.\nTucked away in the depths of\nShoreditch, on the opposite side of\ntown to Imperial, it is a bit of a\nmission to get to, but it\u2019s only a\nfive minute walk once you get to\nLiverpool Street. Just off Shoreditch\nHigh Street and under the arches,\nyou might at first get the impression\nthat this is going to be one of those\ndingy squat-type places, where\nd\u00e9cor and style are sacrificed for\nsub-culture and sweat. Not so here,\nthough \u2013 the entrance has a nice\nglass door, the security are civil, and\nthe queuing clubbers are stylishly\nattired.\nThese days, the East End is home\nto a plethora of upmarket bars and\nclubs, and Cargo is one of the mainstays of this scene. Inside, rather\nthan bare walls and a large stack\nof speakers in the corner, you\u2019ll find\nbars selling double-sized bottles of\nBudvar, tables, seating, and handy\nshelves to put your empties on.\nWhilst not huge, Cargo holds several\nhundred. Like many clubs, the place\nhas expanded on the club/bar format\nand now has a restaurant too.\nWhen we arrived, the DJ on stage\nwas spinning a nice enough, but not\ncaptivating, selection of hip-hop. As\nthe night moved on, he picked up the\npace a bit with some pretty impressive scratching over a few tracks,\nplus some very cool beat juggling,\nwhich always fascinates me (mix-ing two identical records, alternately\npulling each one back to repeat and\nremix the track and create some\nunique beats).\nThe headliner tonight was Rahzel,\n\u2018the undisputed beatbox champion\nof the world\u2019. For those of you that\ndon\u2019t know, beatboxing is the art of\nmaking (hip-hop) music with your\nmouth. This might make you think of\nyour mates in primary school making drum noises in a kind of \u2018pht, ch,\npht pht, ch\u2019 fashion, but Rahzel is\nleagues ahead of this. By the time he\narrived, the place was pretty packed,\nand quite rightly so. Appearing on\nstage with DJ JS1, he started the\nshow with a track he\u2019s made with\nRoni Size, Out Of Breath. Now, to\nhear someone make a drum and\nbass beat with his mouth is remark-able. To hear someone reproduce an\nentire track is astounding. Rahzel\u2019s\nvocal ability means he can create\nbeats, bass, plus vocals, scratches\nand other sounds, all at the same\ntime, and make them sound better than the original. He can hum\na resounding bassline, penetrating\ndrums, and it\u2019s little wonder that\nsome people think he cheats by\nusing sound samples.\nFurther into the show, Rahzel\nshowcased his talent even more with\na battle against JS1. The DJ played a\nrecent, big hip hop tune, then Rahzel\ngave it some pantomime style audience participation: \u201cAnything JS can\ndo, I can do better,\u201d \u201cNo you can\u2019t\u201d\n\u201cYes I can\u2026\u201d Ahem.\nAn artist this big can get away\nwith stuff like that though, and the\ncrowd were more than willing to join\nin. How right he was \u2013 every track\nthe DJ laid down, Rahzel would take\nand reproduce in his own style \u2013 this\nmeans a more bumping beat, fatter\nbass-line, and whatever interpretation of the vocals and melody he\ncould incorporate.\nThis really is an aural marvel.\nWhilst there are, no doubt, others\nthat do a similar thing, this guy\nreally is the champ. I have a feeling\nthat part of the sound is to do with\nhaving his mic whacked up as high\nas it\u2019ll go \u2013 if you listen to him on\nrecord there\u2019s no comparison. This\nis definitely something you should\nexperience live, if for nothing else\nthen just the spectacle of his mouth.\nThe night was a pleasure, with only\na few negatives. Firstly, the entrance\nfee is a lot of money for one main\nact that you only see for a couple\nof hours, especially on a Thursday\nnight. The camp audience participation did make me cringe a little,\nthough it\u2019s not really a big issue as\nit was part of the show. Lastly, whilst\nhaving big bottles of beer is a nice (if\npocket emptying) change, it\u2019s not so\nnice when the bottles end up shattered all over the floor. By the end of\nthe night I had shards stuck in the\nsoles of my shoes \u2013 not a pleasant\nfeeling.\nThese issues aside, Cargo is a very\ncool venue, and Rahzel is definitely\nat the top of his game \u2013 well worth\nthe expedition across London.\nSimon Clark\nCLUB REVIEW\nIf you caught last week\u2019s feature on\nFabric\u2019s birthday, you\u2019ll have an idea\nof how vast the place is. Last weekend I experienced this in a whole\nnew light, as when I arrived the\nplace was mostly empty. It hadn\u2019t\nopened yet, and the place looked\neven more vast than when it\u2019s\njam-packed with sweaty clubbers.\nFloodlights were on; people were\nscurrying around and soundcheck-ing the lovely big sound system.\nNormally I wouldn\u2019t have arrived\nuntil about midnight, but tonight I\u2019d\ncome early to catch the first DJ of\nthe night, Macpherson.\nIt might not sound particularly\nimpressive to have a warm-up set,\nbut you have to realise that this is\nactually quite a big achievement.\nFirstly, consider that Fabric really is\na very good, very popular and very\nbig club. They really can pick and\nchoose where artists are concerned.\nAlso, it\u2019s becoming more and more\nthe case these days that \u2018everyone\u2019s a DJ\u2019. As club culture grows\nand equipment becomes cheaper,\nthere\u2019s no shortage of DJs around,\nespecially in the world of drum and\nbass.\nWhen Macpherson started his\nset at 9.30pm there was literally a\nhandful of people in the vast open\nexpanse of Room Two, but that didn\u2019t\nmean there was no-one dancing.\nMacpherson\u2019s style is fast, switching\nbeats between tracks so quickly that\nhe easily gets through 25 records for\nevery hour he plays. This is great\nwith drum and bass \u2013 the drums\nnever stay the same for long, and\neach rolling, bouncing bassline is\nquickly superceded by the next.\nPlaying for only the first couple\nof hours, Macpherson\u2019s crowd was\nnever going to be massive \u2013 the pubs\nhadn\u2019t even chucked out yet \u2013 but as\nhis set progressed the club gradually filled up. I have to confess that\nI\u2019m not a real drum and bass head\nlike some, but it was easy to tell he\nwas hitting the spot. Hoody-and-capadorned ravers were bouncing and\njiggling, and the screams and shouts\nin the breakdowns and at the end of\nhis set said it all. When he left the\nbooth, as Teebee came on, the room\nwas more or less full (if not totally\nrammed) and the crowd was more\nthan just warmed up.\nI hung around in Room Two\nfor a while and had a drink with\nMacpherson to congratulate him\non his set. Teebee\u2019s set was a fair\namount heavier than the music\nbefore, and the MC was getting a\nlot more involved. The big fat laser\nwas on, and the crowd was getting\nmore packed and more sweaty. As\nI said, drum and bass isn\u2019t my first\npassion in dance music, so I went off\nto check out the other rooms.\nFabricLive is generally home to\nbeat-led music, and tonight Room\nOne was host to hip-hop, with the\nstage occupied by an MC working\nthe crowd. Having spent the past\nfew hours getting shaken up by some\nbreakneck drum and bass, it was a\nbit to slow for me so I headed up to\nRoom Three, in time for Bedrock\nBreaks DJ Meat Katie. I don\u2019t know\nwhere the Katie part of the name\ncomes from, since Meat Katie is\nactually a bloke, but I can tell you all\nabout the meat. This guy has some\nimmense records, and the place\nwas positively jumping. His sound is\nchunky, funky but tough breaks, and\nrelatively housey. It\u2019s almost like the\nbest of both worlds, with breakbeats\nleading the swelling. This was really\nmy thing, and I spent a large part of\nthe night here.\nStopping back into Room Two\nlater, I was greeted by the sounds\nof The DJ & The Drummer. This is\nexactly what it says on the tin, and\nit makes for a striking performance.\nWith the crazy sampled and sped up\ndrums usually found in drum and\nbass, I wouldn\u2019t expect many drummers could come close to imitating\nsome of the beats, but this guy rattled through the maddest of breaks\nwith ease.\nOverall this was another cracking\nnight out, and I have to congratulate\nMacpherson not just for getting a\nset at Fabric, but for pulling it off so\nwell. Keep your eyes out for him in\nthe future (he\u2019s also bar resident at\nMovement), and remember where\nyou heard it first!\nSimon Clark\n\u25cf Catch Macpherson at\nFabricLive on Friday 19\nNovember 2004\nMacpherson makes good\nHe\u2019s the man in charge of all the entertainments at the Union, but he\u2019s also a rising star in\nthe drum and bass world.

    "content": "By Amadeus Stevenson\nPhysics department\nHacking is a widely misunderstood term used by the media\nto refer to the act of breaking\ninto other people\u2019s systems\nand generally doing stuff you\nshould not. Hacking is in fact\nthe art of skilful programming.\nCracking is the profane act of\nbreaking into computer sys-tems. We are going to look at\nthe most common methods to\nbreak into a system, and what\nyou can do to prevent it from\nhappening to you.\nThe most easily preventable\napproach to gaining access\nto a system involves cracking your passwords, whether\ndone manually with a \u201cdictionary attack\u201d which tries a\nlong list of possible passwords\n(like your favourite pastime,\ngirlfriend\u2019s birthday etc) or a\n\u2018brute force attack\u2019 where the\nprogram tries every possible\ncombination of characters,\nlike turning the wheel of a safe\nand trying every number combination until it opens. With\nthe wonders of modern com-puting, however, your average\ncracker could write a small\nprogram or script to do this\nwhile he or she is watching a\nweek\u2019s worth of Eastenders\nepisodes.\nMore advanced crackers\ncould use a technique called\npacket sniffing (electronic\neavesdropping) to ascertain\nyour passwords and personal\ninformation while you are\nusing the internet via compromised systems. Then there\nare so-called \u2018script kiddies\u2019,\nuntalented malicious individuals who would readily install\na small program such as a\nTrojan horse or a key-logger\nonto your computer, to capture\nyour passwords as you enter\nthem, or apply an exploit to a\nbug in your computer\u2019s soft-ware. These are all things you\nshould be aware of, without\nneeding to have a complete\nmastery of them. Sometimes\nthese techniques can come in\nuseful for legitimate purposes,\nie on your own systems if you\nforget a password.\nSo, what can you do to\nprotect your computer from\ncrackers?\n1. Use a password. It is\namazing that so many people\nare capable of pressing the\n\u201con\u201d button on your laptop to\ngainmiraculousaccesstoyour\nentire collection of Friends\nepisodes, or more seriously,\nyour emails or college papers.\nIf you have a laptop or a desk-top, you can set a BIOS password on top of your operating system password, which\nis required to simply boot the\nmachine, so attempts to crack\nyour operating system password would first need to get\npast your BIOS password. The\nadministrative password on a\nWindows XP machine is weak\nfor the determined cracker: it\ncan be easily reset as long as\nthe machine has a floppy drive\nand an on/off button. A BIOS\npassword is far less straightforward to bypass, and you\nneed that to start the machine\nup in the first place. Just\nmake sure you do not forget\nit. And as we have seen from\nthe different password cracking methods above, choose\na good password that\u2019s not\neasily guessable! Some simple\nmaths will show that:\nA lowercase password of\n6 letters gives 266\n= 3.09x108\npossibilities, but a mixed (low-ercase, uppercase, numbers)\npassword of 8 characters\ngives 628\n= 2.18x1014\npossibilities \u2013 so if you use uper/lower\ncases and numbers you stand\na 7000% better chance of protecting your computer.\nIf you are the only one using\nyour computer, try not to use\nthe default administrator\naccount to log in. Your safest\nbet is to set an administrator\npassword, then add a normal\nuser account (with a pass-word) which you would use\nfor writing documents, emails\netc. This would limit the damage possible from a program\nbeing run without your knowledge as, without the administrative access, it would not be\nable to do much harm.\n2. Lock your post when you\nare away from the computer\nfor five minutes and there are\nother people in the room. In\nWindows XP\n, you can press\nctrl-alt-del and \u201cLock computer\u201d to do this. This has\nthe effect of stopping potential misfits using the machine\nuntil they or you type your\npassword in to \u2018unlock\u2019 it. If\nyou don\u2019t have this option you\nwill need to enable the \u201csecure\nlogon\u201d feature (Control Panel\n\u2013> Users).\n3. Keep your operating system updated. If you are a\nMicrosoft Windows user, you\ncan easily update your computer (visit http://windowsup-date.microsoft.com) to make\nsure your computer isn\u2019t riddled with security holes which\nappear over time. Automatic\nupdates are a good idea. The\nsame applies for other operating systems.\nAs we will see next week,\nthese holes are easily exploit-able and pose a significant\nrisk for your computer to\nget infected with spyware,\nadware, viruses and Trojans.\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 October 2004\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n5\n\u201c...the program tries\nevery possible combination of characters,\nlike turning the wheel\nof a safe and trying\nevery combination\u201d\nNews\nin brief\nBy Alex Antonov\nMathematics department\nDuma ratifies Kyoto\nRussia\u2019s lower house of parliament ratified the Kyoto Protocol last Friday, making the pact\ninternationally binding at last.\nTo come into force, the protocol had to be ratified by countries accounting for at least\nhalf of the developed nations\u2019\ngreenhouse emissions.

The lawsuit\nclaimed that the US Navy\u2019s use\nof sonar equipment harms marine mammals.\nNovel malaria vaccine now in sight\nAs research closes in on a malaria vaccine, Emma Williams reports on\nthis and another preventative method being developed at Imperial\nFor many people, going on\nan exotic holiday generally\nmeans taking medicines or\nhaving vaccines against infectious diseases. Nowadays\nthey are easily available and\naffordable. However, the people who live in these countries\nface the ongoing struggle of\ntrying to reduce the incidence\nof such diseases like malaria.\nFor these people the loss of\na few days\u2019 work through illness is devastating. However,\ntimes may be changing, as it\nwas reported this week that\nthere are hopes of finding a\nmalaria vaccine by 2010. Such\na vaccine would offer hope to\nmany people who suffer both\nphysically and financially\nfrom attacks of malaria.\nThe RTS,S/ASO2A vaccine\nwas given to children between\nthe ages of one and four living\nin Mozambique. The vaccine\nattacks what is known as the\nsporozoite stage of development of the parasite. The sporozoites are injected by the\nmosquito into the blood of the\nhuman host. Prior immunisa-tion initiates the production\nof antibodies and white blood\ncells that lock onto the parasite in the blood, reducing its\nsurvival and further develop-ment. The project was funded\nby GlaxoSmithKline biologi-cals (GSK) and through a global project called the PATH\nMalaria Vaccine Initiative,\nfunded by the Bill and Melinda\nGates Foundation.\nMalaria kills over one million people every year and its\nimpact on world health is second only to tuberculosis. The\nparasitic disease is prevalent\nin 90 countries and affects\none in ten of the world\u2019s popu-lation. Malaria is caused by\nthe parasite plasmodium\nand is transmitted via the\nmosquito. There are many\nlife cycle stages of the para-site, completed both in the\nmosquito and human hosts.\nThese stages can cause cyclic\nbouts of fever and chills.\nSevere forms of the infection\ncan lead to kidney and brain\ndamage, anaemia, coma and\neventually death.\nFinding new ways to prevent malarial transmission is\nbecoming increasingly important due to the high levels of\nresistancetotraditionaldrugs\nand insecticides. Political and\nsocial upheaval has led to\nlarge numbers of people relocating to new areas where\nthe disease can be spread\nmore easily. Additionally,\nchanges in the environment\nsuch as road building, mining\nand irrigation have produced\nnew breeding grounds for\nmosquitos.\nCloser to home, Imperial\nCollege PhD students and\npost-doctoral researchers\nare working on similar ways\nto prevent malaria transmis-sion. One candidate currently\nbeing tested in Thailand is\na transmission blocking vac-cine. While the GSK vaccine\nprevents the infection of the\nhuman host, this transmission blocking vaccine prevents parasitic agents taken\nfrom human host blood from\ndeveloping in the mosquito\nand therefore precludes their\nfurther transmission.\nOne current PhD project is\nexamining methods to evaluate the efficacy of malaria\nvaccines. Current so-called\n\u2018gold standard\u2019 tests take 10\ndays to complete. New techniques are being developed\nthat are quicker and more\nrobust to observe whether\nthe vaccine is working and to\nmonitor if the parasite count\nis lowered. Serum from blood\nsamples taken from immu-nised patients is used to culture the parasite in vitro (ie\noutside the host).\nPhD student, Souraya\nRamjanee told Felix: \u201cIt is\nhoped that the development\nof new techniques will reduce\ntime and labour input and will\nin the long term lower costs\nassociated with the development of new malaria vac-cines, funding for which can\nbe very difficult to obtain.\u201d\nIn the future it is hoped\nthat by using a combination\nof preventative methods, the\nincidence of malaria infections will decrease. These\nmeasures will include not\nonly the use of vaccines, but\nalso insecticide impregnated\nbed nets and environmental\ncontrol.\nResearch at Imperial may one day prevent transmission of\nmalaria by halting parasites developing in mosquitos\nKeeping your computer cyberspatially safe\n...or how to stop computer crackers from breaking into your computer\nCybersecurity is a massive industry, not surprising in view\nof the increasing danger of computer crackers\n\u201c...times may be\nchanging, as it was\nreported this week\nthat there are hopes of\nfinding a malaria\nvaccine by 2010.\u201d\n\n"

The Virgins are\nback! And we have reinforce-ments...\nHaving lost our front row\nto the Scottish highlands and\nSpain, we briefly considered\ndisbanding and reforming\nas the Home Baking Society.\nBut instead, the Virgins\n(Imperial\u2019s women\u2019s rugby\nclub, just in case any freshers\nhaven\u2019t realised yet) decided\nto put our talents to good use,\nand our Freshers Fair fairy\ncakes enticed many (unsus-pecting) fine freshers to sign\nup for some fun and rugby\naction.\nLast Wednesday we took\nto the field for our first competitive match of the season,\naway to Reading in the BUSA\n(British Universities Sports\nAssocation) League. Last\nseason we lost heavily in this\nfixture, so we were out for\nrevenge. Stinky stepped up\nto fill the gap at prop, and off\nwe went.\nThe less said about the first\nhalf the better probably, as\nwe lost the toss and had to\nplay literally uphill. Reading\nkicked the ball in behind us\nand kept us pinned in the bottom corner of the pitch. They\nfound a two man overlap and\nunleashed their rangy cen-tre. 5-0.\nFantastic defence by the\nnew look Virgins back line\npushed Reading off of the\npitch when they continued to\nattack down the wing. Killer\nhad some excellent crash ball\nin the centre but we made\nlife hard for ourselves by not\nusing our width and speed on\nthe wing, remaining in our 22.\nReading used their experience in the backs and some\nwell executed moves in the\ncentre to go 10-0 up.\nIn the second half, and with\nthe slope on our side, we\nfared much better. We spread\nthe ball wide to Whiplash,\nwho ran us out of our 22. It\ntook three of their players\nto bring down our tiny back\non their 10m line. Crucially,\nWhiplash mullered their 13\nand main strike runner \u2013 well\ndone, pints for you! Gump\ntook the ball from the back of\nthe Reading scrum and went\ncharging off down the hill into\ntheir 22. The following period\nof forward pressure took us\nover their line twice, but the\nref decided we had been held\nup.\nThe Reading scrum half\ncontinually tried to kick them\nout of danger, but instead\nsent the ball straight into the\narms of Tumbles, who ran\nit back down their throats.\nFrom a messy breakdown\nin front of the posts, Flipper\nfound prop Tree Total on the\nwing (a breach of the trade\ndescriptions act, surely), who\nwas unstoppable from 5m\nout.\nFrom the restart we\nworked our way back down\nto the pitch thanks to textbook forward pick and drive,\nand again spun the ball wide\nto debuntant centre Udders\nwho brushed off three tackles to crash over and score\nagain. We then needed three\npoints in as many minutes for\nvictory but Reading weren\u2019t\nabout to give up, and again\ntheir scrum half\u2019s fine boot\nsent us back into our 22 from\nwhere we couldn\u2019t recover.\nUltimately we were in fine\nspirits, knowing if we can produce rugby of that standard\neach week we will beat every\nother team in our league, and\nthat all our lovely freshers\nare going to get even better\ntoo! How exciting! We piled\nback into the van (driven by\nour new team bitch Ed \u2013 hail\nto the bus driver indeed),\nsang songs, and composed\na nice letter to our local MP\nMichael Portillo, campaigning for more piss-stops\nbetween Reading (and for\nthat matter Harlington) and\nSouth Kensington.\nFinally, best of luck to\nGump who goes for England\nStudents trials this weekend.\nHere\u2019s hoping for an Imperial\nback row showdown when\nEngland play Scotland!\nVirgins narrowly defeated at\nReading, but future looks bright\nRUGBY\nA Reading forward leaps highest to claim the ball at a\nlineout during their close victory over Imperial\nUnder the posts: the Virgins before the match\n\n"

    "content": "The 13th Convention on\nInternational Trade in\nEndangered Species (CITES)\nclosed last week in Bangkok\nhaving revised trade rules\non an eclectic mix of animals\nand plants. Issues discussed\nranged from ivory to caviar,\nas participants from 154 governments fought for their\ncountries\u2019 interests amongst\nconservation groups representing the wildlife.\nThe location for the convention was controversial\nbecause of Thailand\u2019s poor\nrecord on wildlife crime.\nBangkok houses grotesque\nanimal \u2018theme parks\u2019 and\nremains a hive of illegal wildlife trade with a thriving ivory\nmarket. Ironically, last week\nthe city became the location\nfor extensive debate on the\nfuture of legal ivory trading.\nAppropriately, the symbol\nfor CITES is an elephant. The\nrecovery of African elephant\npopulations over the last 10-15 years is a CITES success\nstory. This year, the conference agreed to continue protecting elephants by cracking\ndown on unregulated domestic ivory markets (particularly\nin Asia), and to strengthen\nlaw enforcement efforts to\nprotect the species. It was\nalso agreed that public awareness campaigns be launched\nin all African elephant range\ncountries, and that progress\nreports be made by the end\nof March 2005. In addition,\nNamibia, which has a large,\nstable elephant population,\nhad its request to sell an\nannual quota of ivory reject-ed. As an apparent appease-ment, the southern African\ncountry was authorized to sell\ntraditional ivory carvings as\ntourist souvenirs.\nSignificantly, however, both\nNamibia and South Africa,\nwere successful in their\nrequest to allow the return\nof black rhino trophy hunting.\nBoth countries will now be\nable to sell hunting permits\nfor five male rhinos per year.\nHaving been obliterated in\nthe 1970s and \u201880s by poach-ers, the black rhino population remains highly endan-gered, yet conservationists\nfrom southern Africa believe,\nsomewhat paradoxically, that\nallowing the hunting of old\nmale rhinos past breeding\ncondition is in the best interests of the species in the long\nrun.\nTrophy hunting (the hunting of large animals for their\nheads or skins) is big busi-ness. A hunting safari can cost\nover $300,000, so it is no surprise that some hunting packages are sold in Las Vegas\ncasino halls. Every year many\nAmericans and Europeans\ntravel to Africa specifically\nto shoot its wildlife, paying\nfor permits, internal flights,\ntaxes and accommodation.\nThe money that hunting generates can provide funds and\nan incentive for African governments to protect and manage their wildlife \u2013 if every\nblack rhino is worth $300,000\nto Namibia, then it\u2019s likely\nthat Namibian rhinos will be\nwell looked after.\nWhile last week\u2019s CITES\nmeeting supported this view\nby allowing controlled rhino\nhunting, it is not universally\npopular. The Kenyan CITES\noffice, under pressure from a\nminority of lion conservation\ngroups, had requested lions\nbe moved to an Appendix I\nconservation status, thus banning any commercial trade\nand making lion trophy hunt-ingillegal.OnAppendixI,lions\nwould have been assigned the\nsame conservation status as\ngiant pandas, with any trade\nin them illegal. The Kenyan\nlion proposal, however, was\ndropped on the eve of the\nconference and lion hunting\nwill continue in Kenya.\nProfessor Craig Packer, the\nofficial delegate for Tanzania\nat the conference, lobbied\nagainst the Kenyan lion\nreclassification. He told Felix:\n\u201cAppendix I would imply that\nlions suffer from significant\nlevels of international trade.\nHowever, the primary threat\nto lion populations is habitat loss and problem animal\ncontrol \u2013 the extent of trophy hunting is just too low to\nworry about\u201d.\nAppendix II status requires\nthe use of CITES export permits for any trade in that spe-cies. The great white shark,\na commercially valuable species in decline, is now protected under this legislation.\nOther decisions made at the\nconference include the down-listing of the Cuban crocodile from Appendix I to II to\nallow the Cuban government\nto supply eggs and hatchlings to crocodile ranching\noperations. The Irrawaddy\ndolphin (of little value com-mercially) has been moved\nup to Appendix I. Other species under debate were the\nramin and agarwood trees,\nboth of which are now protected under CITES. The caviar trade will now be under\nstricter control, recognizing\nthe threat to the sturgeon and\na sustainable caviar market.\nSecretary General of\nCITES, Willem Wijnstekers,\nclaimed: \u201cThe Bangkok conference has crafted solutions\nto meet particular needs of\nmany wildlife species that\nare endangered or that could\nbecome so if traded unsustainably\u201d, and added that the\nsolutions \u201c\u2026seek to conserve\nthe Earth\u2019s rich heritage of\nbiological diversity while supporting the sustainable development of local communities\nand national economies\u201d.\nThe next CITES meeting\nis likely to take place in two\nyears\u2019 time, and it is hoped\nthat more than just 154 of\nthe world\u2019s governments will\nattend. While this figure is\nan improvement on the 141\nrepresented at the previous\nmeeting in Chile, the protection of endangered species\nrequires global co-operation.\nEndangered species ruling to promote hunting\nProtecting endangered species is a tricky business. Iain Taylor reports on the most\nimportant decisions and compromises made at last week\u2019s CITES conference\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 October 2004\n4\nThe black rhino: will CITES\u2019 decision to allow limited trophy\nhunting of this endangered species help its survival?\n\u201cTrophy hunting is big\nbusiness. A hunting\nsafari can cost over\n$300,000, so it is no\nsurprise that some\nhunting packages are\nsold in Las Vegas\ncasino halls\u201d\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe Science Orangutan\nIn a new weekly thing, we\ntake an irreverent humour-based look at science. This\nweek we look at the controversial topic of science\njokes:\nThe \u2018functions\u2019 joke\nf(x)=6x+3 walks into a bar.\n\u201cGot any sandwiches?\u201d\nf(x)=6x+3 asks the barman.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he replies, \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t cater for functions\u201d.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asks the function.\n\u201cCos the Sin on the door\nsays so!\u201d\nNoah\u2019s Ark\nThe Flood is over and the ark\nhas landed.

Everywhere he\nlooks, he finds baby animals.\nEveryone is doing fine except\nfor one pair of little snakes.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d says\nNoah.\n\u201cCut down some trees and\nlet us live there\u201d, say the\nsnakes.\nNoah follows their advice.\nSeveral more weeks pass.\nNoah checks on the snakes\nagain. Lots of little snakes,\neverybody is happy.

If\nyou have a wife and want a\ndivorce, it causes all sorts of\nlegal problems.\u201d\nThe doctor says: \u201cIt\u2019s better to have a wife because\nthe sense of security lowers\nyour stress and is good for\nyour health.\u201d\nThe mathematician says:\n\u201cYou\u2019re both wrong.

Then contact\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwith your monkey.\nYOUR SCIENCE VIEWS\ntell Felix what you think science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cI read with interest James Berry\u2019s article on organic farming in issue 1302. Many\ninteresting points were raised about the environmental benefits of organic farming,\nfor example the increased biodiversity on organic farms. However, I felt that the key\nissue was not discussed: is organic farming a sustainable solution for use worldwide\nin helping to feed the starving millions?\nI remember reading once that to sustain a world population of 6 billion using organic farming would require virtually all of the earth\u2019s surface to be cultivated. Therefore,\nwhether we like it or not, we are going to have to investigate alternative methods. If\nwe do not want to wash the world with pesticides then perhaps GM crops really are\nthe only way forward...\u201d\nRosie Chandler\nPhysics Department\n\u201cI appreciate your concerns regarding the Earth\u2019s food production capacity to sustain\nour ever-increasing global population. However, the worldwide situation was a little\nbit beyond the article\u2019s scope... Also I think it\u2019s worth remembering that organic\nfarming explicitly bans the use of chemical sprays, and that the most economically\nimportant GM crops currently used confer resistance to non-specific pesticides, such\nas glyphosate. So a GM future for agriculture will almost certainly be associated with\npesticides.\u201d\nJames Berry\nBiochemistry Department\n\n"

    "content": "The student newspaper of Imperial College \u25cf Established 1949 \u25cf Issue 1303 \u25cf Thursday 28 October 2004 \u25cf www.felixonline.co.uk\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nFollowing last week\u2019s Imperial\nCollege Union elections,\nin which turnout reached a\nrecord high but only 15 of 40\nposts were filled, steps are\nbeing taken to strengthen candidates\u2019 positions against \u2018ReOpen Nominations\u2019 (RON).\nRON finished ahead of the\nmajority of candidates after\nthe votes were counted. 16\npeople were to be elected to\nUnion Council, but only five\nfinished ahead of RON, so\nthere will be a new election\nfor the remaining 11 places.\nThere will also be new elections to the Trading and Retail,\nHouse, Services and Student\nDevelopment Committees for\nsimilar reasons.\nThe situation may have been\ncaused by voters\u2019 unfamiliarity with the candidates, and\nby the emphasis being placed\non simply voting, rather than\nthinking about it first.\nSam Rorke, the Deputy\nPresident (Education and\nWelfare), told Felix that \u201cthe\nUnion will be taking steps to\nmake sure that students are\ngiven access to all the information they need before they\nmake their choice\u201d.\nThe elections will be publicised more widely in the student media, including Felix,\nwith more information provided about the candidates\nthemselves. The time periods\nfor nominations, campaigning\nand voting are likely to be\nextended in order to allow students to make \u201can informed\nchoice\u201d.\nUnder the STV system, voters rank the candidates in\norder of preference. In Union\nelections, students are always\nprovided with the option of\nvotingtore-opennominations,\nin order to express their\ndissatisfaction with the\ncandidates and start a new\nelection with, in theory, an\nimproved list of people to vote\nfor. However, the prospect\nof ranking 16 candidates in\norder of preference did not\nappeal to a large proportion of\nthe electorate. It is far easier\nto mark a first preference and\nthen simply choose RON.\nStudents were strongly\nencouraged to vote by the\nlarge-scalepublicitycampaign\nand by the \u2018doughnuts for\nvotes\u2019 incentive introduced by\nthe Union President, through\nwhich 25p per vote would go to\na club or society of the voter\u2019s\nchoice. However, they were\nnot encouraged to take any\nmore than a fleeting interest\nin the candidates and may not\nhave realised the consequences of voting for new elections.\nVoting RON was the simple\nand obvious choice, a choice\nthat Union officers will have\nto change if they are to fill\ntheir Committee posts in the\nnear future.\nMustafa Arif, President\nof Imperial College Union,\nadmitted that the prospect\nof another triumph for RON\nwas a concern, but stressed\nthat \u201cif people don\u2019t have\nconfidence in those standing\nfor election and want to vote\nRON, then that\u2019s what they\u2019re\nentitled to do\u201d.\nThelastnotable\u2018success\u2019for\nRON occurred in 1997, when it\ndefeated candidates for the\npost of Union President on\nthree occasions within a period of four months.\nNew elections for all the\nunfilled posts will take place\nnext month, with nominations due to open at 9am on\nMonday and close on Friday\n12 November.

    "content": "SINGLE REVIEWS\nYou would think Blinded By The\nLights would be like a really dull\nanecdote. So, Mike Skinner has\ngone to a club. Initially he can\u2019t find\nhis friends. He indulges in some\nrecreational drugs. He wanders to\nthe foyer in an attempt to get a signal on his mobile (most probably on\nT-Mobile then).\nAnd so his evening continues,\nalthough alas we are not treated to\nhis night bus antics or indeed the\njourney from his front door to his\nbed. But there\u2019s something about\nit. There\u2019s a tune not unlike the\nintro to Never Tear Us Apart by\nthe late INXS. There\u2019s a slow, tinny\nbeat, plodding along in the dark-ness. There are the hollow voices\nwhispering retorts to the continual\ntrain of thought running through\nthe song. There\u2019s a definite sense\nthat we\u2019ve all been here, and while\nit makes you a little tired just listening to it, it\u2019s okay, because it\u2019s just\na song.\nGiulia Clark\nIn a startling departure from their\nprevious spoof-rap japery, surprise success Goldie Lookin\u2019 Chain\nhave produced a serious song, a\nheart-breaking post-modern tearjerker about the emotional pain\nand confusion experienced by all\nconcerned when a middle-aged\nparent is revealed to be transgen-dered. Typified by a subtle blend of\nthoughtful melody and toe-tapping\nbeats, Your Mother\u2019s Got A Penis\nis wistful and inspiring by turns,\nrunning the gamut of human sentiments in a roller-coaster ride that\nwill leave you breathless, energised\nand begging for more. Awards and\ncritical plaudits are ensured.\nNah, I\u2019m just yanking your chain.\nYour Mother\u2019s Got A Penis is predictably silly, poppy and puerile from\nbeginning to end. But it\u2019s laugh-out-loud funny and insanely catchy,\nand therefore does its intended job\nadmirably. Everyone\u2019ll love it. Go\non, sing it at the next huge, bald,\nscary-looking fucker you see in the\npub. I dares you. He\u2019ll love it too, I\nswear. Safe.\nAnna Novitzky\nWell, no hidden meanings here, but\nwe wouldn\u2019t expect anything less\nfrom those crazy Detroit disco-punks. Nice guitar lead with a thread\nof the synthetic, a racy beat, and\nvocals deep and dirty as per usual.\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine a crowd jumping to this one, especially with the\nodd finger pointing \u2018hey\u2019 or \u2018yeah\u2019\nadded for good measure. It\u2019s less\neasy to imagine singing along with\na serious look on your face, but then\nI guess that\u2019s the idea. It\u2019s not going\nto win any awards for innovation,\nbut I have no doubt it will become an\nanthem in student unions across the\nland. Plus, as an added bonus, the\nband have made it available as a free\ndownload at electric6.com, so what\nare you waiting for? Get bopping.\nGiulia Clark\nA little background on this unholy offering is required. Firstly, you\nneed to know it is nine minutes\n22 seconds long, yes I said long.\nSecondly, it is wholly instrumental,\napparently \u2018music in the best sense\u2019\nwhich will \u2018take hold of you\u2019, if the\npress release has anything to say\nabout it. Thirdly, it will be priced\nat a shocking \u00a32.50 because, in the\nband\u2019s eyes, it is worth 51 pence\nmore than everything else. Lastly it\nis inspired by the death of founder\nmember Jeremy Holtom\u2019s wife, and\nif that\u2019s not emotional blackmail, I\ndon\u2019t know what is.\nTo prepare for the Traveller experience I would advise you to firstly\nfind a time machine and transport\nyourself back to the 1980s. Next you\nwill need to find a lonely field and\nget naked (with the exception a few\nspuriously placed daisy chains). And\nfinally have a \u2018feel the music, man\u2019\nmoment, accompanied by some\nclosed-eyed dancing and possibly a\nsmattering of intense head nodding.\nThen if you\u2019re lucky, beings from\nanother planet will abduct you and\nerase any trace of this odd, new-age-but-not, hippy nonsense from your\nbrain. As you may have guessed, not\nmy bag.\nGiulia Clark\nOthers may embrace the similarity\nbetween FNY and certain Detroit\nbased bands (you know the one I\nmean, the one with only two members where incest is most definitely\nbest); I, however do not.\nThe main problem with this first\nouting into the big wide world of\n\u2018singles\u2019 is that Hollywood Bowl\ncan\u2019t really decide what it wants to\nbe. Stomping, yes. Chugging gui-tars, yes. Emphatic yelling of the\nword \u2018hey\u2019, yes. And yet, a 1950s\nstyle Hawaiian Beach Boys effort\nactually provides the most promising moment of the track, only to be\nswiftly replaced by a section of noncommittal da-da-das.\nAdmittedly there is something\nvery smooth about bassist Emma\nRichardson\u2019s vocals, but out of the\nlive setting they, and many other\ncatchy elements, are drowned out\nby the unremarkableness of it all.\nGiulia Clark\nI would imagine that singer-song-writer Martin Grech is widely\nunknown to most people. If you have\nheard of him, it\u2019s probably due to\nhis single Open Heart Zoo that was\nused on a Lexus car advert \u2013 a spine-tingling waltz with Martin\u2019s ethereal swooping falsetto. His debut\nalbum was a strange mish-mash of\nRadiohead-like indie anthems, darkly introverted ballads, and frankly\nbizarre progressive nu-metal.\nHis voice is an acquired taste. Not\nas powerful as, say, Matt Bellamy\u2019s\nglass-shatteringyell, it\u2019s a bit whiney.\nOn this collection of acoustic guitar\nsongs, as a stop-gap before his new\nalbum, his singing becomes emotive\nand touchingly fragile.\nMighty Hands starts with gently\nstrummed and very melodic gui-tar, developing with interesting cor-diality. Mr Grech bemoans the fact\nthat he \u201ctrusted in liars, bent down\nfor them\u201d before having his cloud-scraping \u201coohs\u201d superimpose over\nan otherwise restrained chorus.\nGratefully Punished is discordant\nand doesn\u2019t make for easy listen-ing, with his moans a bit over-the-top and grating. The EP gets back\non track with Father and Mother\nFigure, a much more lush and harmonious song, with some pretty fin-ger-picking and the help of a choir.\nThere\u2019s also some instrumentation,\nin the form of a tambourine, cowbell\nand hand-claps.\nMartin saves the best \u2018til last with\nthe hair-raisingly delicate Freedom,\nWarmth And Sincerity. A strangely\ndistorted piano plays in the background as he stretches his voice\nto quietly sing a melody so tender\nit could almost be a lullaby. The\nmiddle of the track features him\nsighing smoothly as a choir hums\ngently below, and it ends with him\nimploring: \u201cNow guilt is dead, and\nall is said, you are forgiven. Now it\u2019s\na case, of sit and wait, for the saints\nto come for me\u201d.\nA beautiful collection of music\noverall, and obvious proof that sometimes less is more.\nJames Millen\nAll singles together\nSince singles have been conspicious by their absence in recent weeks, here\u2019s a big roundup of things you\u2019ve heard and possibly hated on the radio\nElectric Six: basically, the worst fashions of the last 30 years compressed into one band.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 October 2004\nARTS arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\n21\nHe is a nuisance, his work is deliberately off-putting, and as he says\nhimself, he can hardly stand to be\naround it for long, but Bruce Nauman\nhas become the most influential\nAmerican artist of his generation.\nAnd it is now for you to judge at the\nTate Modern.\nRaw Materials, by Nauman, is\nUnilever\u2019s fifth Turbine Hall project\nand is a sound piece. And indeed\nhow better to fill that vast cavernous\nspace than with sounds and noise\nthat are bound to take on a whole\nnew meaning as they reverberate\naround the emptiness of the hall. Let\nus give you a taste of it:\n\u201cThank you thank you thank you\nthank you...\u201d, \u201cThink think think\nthink think...\u201d, \u201cLive and die, die and\ndie; shit and die, piss and die... fail\nand live, smile and live, think and\nlive, pay and live...\u201d and as another\nphrase goes: \u201cYou may not want to\nbe here, you may not want to be\nhere...\u201d\nIf you haven\u2019t gone crazy yet, and\nyou do actually want to be here, then\nread on.\nBorn in Indiana, USA, in 1941,\nBruce Nauman studied mathemat-ics, and soon after graduating had a\nmajor profound realization that \u201cif I\nwas an artist and I was in the studio,\nthen whatever I was doing in the\nstudio must be art. At this point, art\nbecame more of an activity and less\nof a product\u201d. Hmm...\nFrom this point, Nauman concentrated less on the development of a\ncharacteristic style and more on the\nway in which a process or activity\ncan transform or become a work of\nart. A survey of his output demonstrates the alternately political,\nprosaic, spiritual and crass methods\nby which Nauman examines life in all\nits gory details, mapping the human\narc between life and death.\nLanguage has always been central to Nauman\u2019s work, as he probed\nhow human beings use it to exist in\nthe world, to communicate or fail to\ncommunicate. For Raw Materials,\nhe recycled 22 texts from previous\nworks and plays them on parallel\nspeakers in the great hall to create\nan aural collage. Some are audio\ncomponents from videos or architectural installations; others are written\ntexts from his sculptures, prints or\ndrawings. Nauman uses the diverse\norigins of the texts to increase the\nrichness and density of the experi-ence. Out of context, they become a\nwhole new experience, a real orchestral work, indeed arranged in the\nspace not by content but by intensity\nand rhythmic connection between\nthem. The unique acoustics of the\nTurbine Hall inspired Nauman with\nthis work, especially the low-level\nhum or \u201cdrone\u201d of the generators\nwhich can still be heard, a reminder\nof the building\u2019s previous life.\nThe work also represents\nNauman\u2019s fascination of space, and\nthe way it can alter our behaviour\nand self-awareness. You do truly get\nconfused if you do the experience\nfor yourself, as the hall is empty\nand yet filled with nearly palpable sound sculptures based on the\nwritten word.\nThe arrangement is more intuitive\nthan thematic, but the last piece in\nthe room, entitled World Peace, provides a resting place and is also one\nof the more interesting works. A man\nand a woman recite a series of simple phrases around the verbs \u201ctalk\u201d\nand \u201clisten\u201d, such as \u201cI\u2019ll talk/they\u2019ll\nlisten\u201d, and \u201cyou\u2019ll listen to us/we\u2019ll\ntalk to you\u201d. In each instance, the\nstatement is reversed in the following line before moving on to the next\nsequence. The title can be taken as\na wry comment on global political\nmisunderstanding. With an economy\nof means, Nauman simultaneously\nrepresents the simplicity and complexity of communication.\nThe end result is not too different\nto some of John Cage\u2019s compositions,\nan early inspiration of Nauman, who\nheld that chance occurrences and\nambient sound can hold equal status\nto intentional compositions. Some of\nthe recordings include loops where\nsingle words are repeated over and\nover, with percussive polyrhythms\nemerging. Another audio follows a\npattern in which different words or\nphrases are conjugated like verbs,\nrepeated in different voices to extract\na variety of meanings. 100 Live and\nDie is a particularly musical work\nthat created rhythm by attaching\na word like \u201cscream\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d to\nthe alternating endings \u201cand live\u201d\nor \u201cand die\u201d. \u201cMusic plays a role in\nmy work,\u201d Nauman has said, \u201ceven\nwhen there is no music\u201d.\nSo, it is for you to judge if one of\nAmerica\u2019s most innovative artists,\nwho focuses much of his material on\nthings that do not provide pleasure\nto others, pleases you. And it is for\nyou to judge whether art should be\nseen and not heard... or heard and\nnot seen.\nHeard and not seen?\nWe all know that children should be seen and not heard, but should the same apply to art?\nDiana Beverly braves the Turbine Hall\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about then?\u201d People unsure whether they want to be in the Turbine Hall\nWalking around Imperial, I see a\nsort of uniform of plain-ness: plain\nshoes, trousers jeans, t-shirts, jump-ers, coats. It\u2019s like there\u2019s some kind\nof unwritten code of what to wear.\nWe seem to want to blend in to the\ncrowd, to avoid any kind of statement at all, even if that is at the\nexpense of looking nice. Obviously\nthere are many exceptions to this\ntrend, but it certainly seems to be\nthe overwhelming apparent inclination of my fellow students.\nI recently trekked down to\nGoldsmiths Student Union to see a\nband night. Thanks to various fac-tors, including the drunken wanderings of several of my housemates,\nI only managed to see the Electric\nSoft Parade, who were headlining,\nbut the evening was still worthwhile,\npartly because ESP were fantas-tic, and partly because it gave me\ninteresting insight into a university\nwhich is the complete antithesis of\nImperial.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know,\njust as Imperial is a science-only\nuniversity, Goldsmiths is an arts-only university. So, without wanting\nto stereotype, I was expecting a different type of student and a different\nkind of union. I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\nIf Imperial students tend not to pay\nany attention at all to what they\nwear, Goldsmiths students seem to\npay attention to everything about\ntheir style.\nWalking into the venue was like\nwalking into a sea of ra-ra skirts,\nmullets, cowboy boots, charity-shop\ndresses, logo t-shirts and army jack-ets. If you\u2019ve ever been to The End\non a Monday night you\u2019ll know what\nI\u2019m talking about. If you don\u2019t, think\nAlison Goldfrapp, the Scissor Sisters\nand Portobello Market all mixed\ntogether.\nSo did they dress better than us?\nAs far as fashion goes, yes, and\nthere were certainly some people\nwho did look amazing. But the prevailing impression was of a lot of\npeople who tried too hard, and all\nended up looking the same. If we\ndon\u2019t try at all to stand out, they\ntried so hard that they came full-circle and all ended up looking the\nsame anyway.\nThe experience made me wonder what is it about studying science that makes us so complacent\nabout our appearance? Maybe it\u2019s\nbecause we like to differentiate\nbetween ourselves and the rest of\nthe world. Maybe we think, because\nwe\u2019re studying things that are so\nmuch more important, that thinking\nabout style would be an insult to our\nintellect.\nBut who doesn\u2019t judge people on\nhow they look? Clearly, some people\njudge in more detail than others,\nbut all clothes say something about\nthe person who\u2019s wearing them.\nClothes are not just for comfort\nor practicality, they tell the world\nabout you. So maybe it\u2019s a good\nidea to have them say something\ndifferent from the person sitting\nnext to you.\nEmily Lines\nBruce Nauman:\nRaw Materials\nTate Modern\nFREE\n\u201cLanguage has\nalways been central\nto Nauman\u2019s work,\nhow humans use it\nto exist in the world,\ncommunicate or fail\nto communicate\u201d\nYou are what you wear... or is that\nmaking too much of an effort?\nSTYLE NOTES\nSome ramblings and\nthe British Museum\nFirst of all, apologies for last week.\nI\u2019m sure everyone was stupendously\ndisappointed due to the lack of an\nArts section and so at a complete\nloss as to how to while away their\nweekends and possibly the odd weekday afternoon in a culturally enriching way. What can I say? \u2018Technical\ndifficulties\u2019 springs to mind, but all\nthat is in the past now, and we have\nhuge two page spread this week to\nmake up for it.\nAnd now on to the ramblings. I\nthink I shall continue on the theme of\narchitecture, which brings me to the\nBritish Museum.\nNot only is the British Museum\nblessed with a fabulous collection of\nantiquities including the ever controversial Elgin Marbles, some really\ngood mummies, and the Rosetta\nStone, it also has its Great Court.\nThe creation of what we now experience as the Great Court is quite\npossibly the most significant event\nin the museum\u2019s recent history. It\nhas completely revitalised what was\nbeginning to become a tired, stuffy\nold museum. Now we can loiter in\npeace, in a beautiful, light space while\ntaking a break from the galleries.\nI remember the first time I went to\nthe Museum once the Great Court\nhad been complete \u2013 I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ve ever spent so long just looking\nup in awe. I still do, and it amazes\nme every time I go (and I go quite\noften!)\nPAOLA SMITH\nARTS EDITOR\n\n"

Numaan Chaudhry investigates\nSo you\u2019ve got yourself the\nlatest 40Gb Apple iPod and\nyou\u2019re pondering what exactly to saturate such a huge\ncapacity with. With download\nspeeds of up to 400Mb per\nsecond, it\u2019s hard to ignore\nthe temptation to download\nmusic straight to your iPod\nthrough the internet. Looking\npast the iPod\u2019s own problems (www.ipodsdirtysecret.\ncom), the risks of this much\nadjourned illegal practice are\nhardly worth taking, not least\nif you\u2019ve made it to Imperial\nand can look forward to an\nenriched future with countless bounties.\n\u2018Twas a gloomy evening in\nlate July 1999 when Shawn\nFanning received his college\nresults and saw all hope of\nan education vanish as he\nrealises his grades weren\u2019t\ngood enough to pass into the\nnext year. So in turning to\nthe internet for his newfound\nventure, he initiated work on\na project that has revolutionized the music industry and\nchurned the guts of even the\nlargest of music record retail-ers: Napster.\nNapster\u2019s instant success\nwas due to a combination of\nthe consumer\u2019s frustration at\nthe rising prices of records as\ncompared to their European\ncounterparts, and the gradual introduction of broadband,\nwhich made downloads up to\nten times faster. It attracted\nover 80 million users following its debut five years ago on\nwww.download.com, where it\nwas first uploaded to by the\nauthor, then aged 18.\nFanning had three primary purposes for developing\nNapster: to act as a search\nengine dedicated to finding\nMP3 files only, to develop further the ability to trade MP3\nfiles directly between users,\nand to integrate into this an\ninternet relay chat, a protocol that enables communication between the sharing\nparties. It wasn\u2019t long before\nNapster became a worldwide\nfilesharing community, and\nthe implications of this most\ninnovative web application\nwere brought to light by the\nRecord Industry Association\nof America (RIAA).\n2001 was the worst year\nfor the music industry, with\nretailers and artists being hit\nespecially hard. There are no\nprizes for guessing the root\ncause of this. In May 2002,\nafter a spontaneous resignation by Napster\u2019s board of\ndirectors and CEO, the company fell and the tornado of\nlegislation wiped any remaining symbols of its illegitimate\nexistence (there is now a\nlegitimate version of Napster\navailable at www.napster.\ncom, but is hardly worth the\ndownload).\nNow, although the number\nof internet music file-sharing\nusers has drastically reduced,\nthe number of users with\nillegal music on their home\ncomputers has increased at\na staggering rate with internet sites and new file-sharing\nprograms, including Kazaa\nand eMule, all to blame.\nThe consequences, to both\nmusicretailersandevensome\nusers, of leeching albums by\nillegal methods are stunning.\nEarlier this month, the British\nPhonographic Industry (BPI)\nannounced it would be prosecuting 28 individuals who are\naccused of downloading and\nuploading copyright material,\nmainly MP3s, onto file-shar-ing networks. To hammer\nhome it\u2019s no tolerance message to \u2018hardcore uploaders\u2019,\nthe BPI has decided to make\npublic the names of the individuals responsible.\nEarlier this year, the RIAA\nfiled more than 900 subpoe-nas, a demand to stand in\ncourt, targeted specifically at\nstudents downloading material illegally on campus. And\nnow we hear reports of students settling with the music\nindustry for up to $10,000, the\nequivalent of buying over 500\nalbums from HMV! Having\nwitnessed the success of this\nscheme, the BPI is pursuing similar strategies in the\nUK and, apart from the 28\naforementioned individuals\nit is suing, it is implementing procedures to seize and\nremove all offending content\nfrom free MP3 sites.\nAs for those pirates who\njustify their downloading\nusing the flawed argument\nthat \u201cdownloading music will\nmake otherwise unknown artists heard and hence increase\ntheir sales\u201d, much can be\nsaid. For instance, what if it\nis the desire of these artists\nto be discreet and infamous,\nas was the case of Pink, the\n24-year old pop star, who now\ndesires privacy over fortune\nand fame? And what about\nthe effects to the \u2018known\u2019 artists and their record labels,\nwho suffer massive unnecessary slumps in revenues and\nhence profits.\nFinally, now that the BPI\nhas commenced a crackdown\non music abusers in the UK,\nis it even worth sharing music\nonline, despite the temptation\nand the fact that you can get\nthe latest singles in under a\nminute? It depends on whether you think that putting \u2018yes\u2019\non an employer\u2019s form under\nthe heading \u2018Have you ever\nbeen convicted in the past?\u2019\nwill jeopardise your future.\nIt\u2019s worth considering the\nalternatives: buying albums\ndirectly from the likes of\nVirgin and HMV or, if that\nseems a bit distasteful to your\nstudent loan, try downloading music... legally, of course.\nApple iTunes, which boasts\nthe largest legal online collection of tracks, offers MP3s for\nas little as 99\u00a2 (55p) per song\nand \u00a36 an album and lets you\nhear a preview for 30 seconds\nbefore you buy.\nDespite the relatively meagre collection of Microsoft\u2019s\niTunes, I prefer it to Apple\u2019s\ndue to the fact that Microsoft\nhas an online store feature\nthat allows the user to see\nand listen to music playing on\nvarious radio stations without\ntheadsandlameDJentertain-ment. In addition, Microsoft\nhas radically improved the\nmobility of songs once they\nare downloaded \u2013 the technology behind iTunes allows the\nuser to easily transport songs\nfrom PC to handheld devices.\nRegardless of which service\nis used, they are both a safer\nalternative than file-sharing\nnetworks.\nThe third reason for not downloading music illegally: if these guys find out, they won\u2019t let you get away with their\nintellectual property\nLatest\nfrom the\nSquare\nMile\nFlight fight\nIcelandair, the thriving airline led by Hannes Smarason,\nannounced its acquisition of\n8.4% of easyJet, a stake second in size only to that owned\nby Easyjet founder Stelios.\nIcelandair has recently\nundertaken a frenzy of buying UK stocks and equity as a\nmeans of diversifying its portfolio and spreading risk.\nM&S shareholders\nteased again\nMarks and Spencer\nannounced on Tuesday that\nit is buying back \u00a32.3bn of\nshares at a price of 360p each,\npathetically lower than the\noffer tendered by Philip Green\nearlier this year. Stuart Rose,\nthe new CEO, will need to\nshow marked performance in\nM&S since his appointment in\norder to prevent Green from\nacquiring the company at his\nproposed second attempt in\nJanuary.\nJoining Mercer?\nMarsh & McLennan, the\nbiggest US-based insurance\nbroker in the world and the\nowner of Mercer Consulting,\nis set to launch an investigation into practices in London\nafter Spitzer, the New York\nattorney, launched a probe\ninto Marsh\u2019s US operations. It\nis thought that Marsh, among\nother insurers, is guilty of rigging fake competition bids for\nits clients. Beware, Marsh\ninvestors \u2013 this has an uncanny resemblance to, dare I say,\nEnron (see Felix 1302).\n\n"

Very Mallory Towers.\nUnfortunately the repeated\nlack of half time oranges\nslightly dulled the Blytonesque feel of the day.\nIt was a really close match\nand so I am going to fly\nthrough the report to the\nstart of the fourth quarter,\nwhere it got terribly exciting.\nReally, really, pant-wetting\nstuff.\nThe last quarter started\n9-9. We had some sneaky\ndraw tactics going on that\nBrighton completely failed\nto respond to. Lizzie would\n\u2018lose\u2019 the draw, feeding the\nball directly to an Imperial\nplayer. Which was really\nrather handy. Tiffany and\nHannah then stormed up\nthe right wing with the ball,\nand the majority of play\nwas around Brighton\u2019s goal.\nOn her debut as an attack,\ndown the wrong end of pitch,\nShivani managed to score a\ncracking goal. But Imperial\nthen slipped a little and\nallowed the Brighton centre\nto charge straight down the\npitch and score. So, 10 each.\nMore sneaky drawing and\nthe ball was once again being\npassed around the Brighton\ngoal. For a while, Imperial\nlooked a little nervy with\nsome dropped passes and\nfrantic tackling, but we pulled\nourselves together and play\npicked up. Ally was having\na cracking game picking up\nloose balls behind goal and\nfeeding them into the dream\nteam of Caroline and Hannah.\nHannah had \u2018umpteen\u2019 shots\non goal and proved that if you\nbang away for long enough\nthen something is going to\nhappen when she scored a\ngood \u2018un to bring us in front\nagain.\nBack to the draw, and an\nImperial cock-up allowed\nthe Brighton captain to get a\nclear run to goal. Superstar\ngoalie Lyndsey saved the\nshot but then slipped and\nfell, leaving Brighton with an\neasy chance that they didn\u2019t\nwaste.\nFive minutes were left and\nwe didn\u2019t want to be going\nhome without the win we\ndeserved. Caroline kept\npushing and pushing through\nthe wall of defenders in the\nfan and was rewarded with\na goal. All we had to do was\nhang on. And hang on we\ndid.\nAt the final whistle we were\nall very happy little Lacrosse\nplayers. Then it all went pear\nshaped. The Umpire called\nthe final score as 12-12. None\nof us know how on earth this\ncan have happened. Brighton\nwere arses and claimed ignorance or \u201cit\u2019s whatever the\numpire says\u201d. Our appeals\nfell on deaf ears and it seems\nlike we are stuck with the\nresult. Bugger. Although, fish\nand chips by the sea followed\nwith turbo shandies did\nhelp to restore our spirits a\nlittle.\nLast word: in the tournament on Saturday, which is\nnever to be mentioned again,\nSamantha Jayaweera gets\nman of the match.

These \u2018cryptic definitions\u2019 (eg 7 down) are quite rare\nbecause they\u2019re hard to think up.\nMost clues have both a definition\nand a recipe for the letters. This\ngenre includes \u2018hidden words\u2019 where\nthe answer is embedded within the\nclue (21 down), reversals (13 across)\nand complex clues which put some\nwords within (14 down) or in front\nof (12 across) others. Look out for\nabbreviations, such as G for \u2018good\u2019\nand O for \u2018old\u2019. Good luck! Snufkin\nFelix Crossword 1303 by Snufkin\nHaving escaped from the Felix\noffice, Tank decides to extract horrible and bloody revenge on his previous employers, Imperial College.\nWith his chameleon-like camou-flage, Tank slipped into the college\nundetected. Fools.\nAn army marches on it\u2019s stomach,\nand Tank\u2019s hungry. However, living in London and being shockingly\noverdrawn, his tank-sized card is\nspat back out. It\u2019s not going well.\nDesperate times, desperate meas-ures. All\u2019s game in love and war,\neven stealing KitKats.\nTank\u2019s run of truly bad luck comes to\nan end as, defying all logic, he does\nwhat nobody at Imperial College\nthought was possible and meets a\ngirl. Go tank, go. You stud you.\nIt wasn\u2019t meant to last. His newfound lady friend realised that actually \u201che\u2019s, like, a tank\u201d and \u201ctotally\ndumped him\u201d for one of the football\nteam. Hurt and lonely, Tank does\nwhat any self-respecting, red-blood-ed male would do and heads out on\nthe lash. Legend.\nWorse for wear, slightly lost and\nwithout a degree in night buses,\nTank attempts to crawl home. Easily\ndistracted, and armed with tecnol-ogy to hit a fresher from across the\nroom, he tries to shoot his way to\nlager.\nOh dear, mission aborted. Running\nlow on batteries and morale, and\nwith the warmth of the Felix office\nbut a distant memory, Tank calls it\na night, only about three hours too\nlate. All in all, a complete and utter\nfailure of a day. Tank, we salute you.\nReturn of\nthe FUCWIT\nFor those who need it explaining,\nFUCWIT is the Felix Unforgettable\nCoffee-Break Weekly Issued\nTournament, and the league of\nextraordinary FUCWITs is your\nchance to show the world (well, the\ncollege at least) just how incredibly,\namazingly clever you are.

Plus anybody who\nmakes us laugh / is unprintable will\nget a point too.\nCryptic Corner: Yes, we know how\nhard this is, but you\u2019re at Imperial,\nyou should be solving these things\nin your sleep. We\u2019re giving a suitably generous 10 points for correct\nanswers here.\nRorke: Nice and easy, there\u2019s a\npoint if you correctly identify the\nfilm, and another point if you can\nwork out the name of the actor(s)\nthat Sam is replacing.\nTank: Just tell us where each\npicture was taken. Don\u2019t just say\nImperial College, you need to be\nmore specific than that. There\u2019s a\npoint for each one.\nThat\u2019s a grand total of 39 points\nup for grabs.
