    "content": "Feature\nTh\nRector's View\nSir Ronald Oxburgh talks to Owain Bennallack about some of this year's pressing issues\nI'd only met the Rector once before and I can't remember saying anything, except to\nacknowledge that yes, he could have\nanother piece of my spicy beef pizza. So\nwhat was he like? He was thoroughly\npleasant and attentive, incredibly alert and\nconfident. In terms of breaking his cool\nveneer I was completely useless - Brian\nWalden, your job is secure. But in terms of\napproaching the head of Imperial on behalf\nof my humble readership: for my sins I was\nimpressed. As much as anything else, he\nseems much more mindful of student\ninterests than most other senior figures.\nAnyway, below is an abridged and fairly\nfaithful version. See what you think.\nWould you agree with the sentiment that\nwhilst present students must be consulted\nand informed about any significant changes to the campus environment, long-term decisions, such as the possible move\nof Imperial College Union to the Sherfield\nBuilding, are best left to those qualified\nand appointed to make them?\n[laughs] \"And when did you start beating\nyour wife?\"\nIt isn't at all hedged...\nAs far as I'm concerned we have to present\nICU with an opportunity which is so good that\neveryone wants to come to Sherfield. Ultimately\n- yes, I am the person who is responsible for the\nway that money is spent in college but I think\neveryone around here likes as far as possible to\nwork by consensus. I shall be very disappointed\nif we cannot come up with a scheme so\nattractive that the Union says 'this is what we\nwant'.\nWould you overrule ICU if it said 'this isn't what we want'?\nI can't visualise a situation in which that\ncould happen. If people come up with overriding reasons we've overlooked, then okay, we\nhave to think again.\nDo you think that moving to Sherfield could\nlead to a curbing of student activities just\nthrough close proximity to the heart of\nbureaucracy?\nI wish I thought it could! No, I don'f think\nthere's the remotest chance.\nSo there isn'ta chance of less late-night\nlicenses being granted et cetera.\nI don't think it has any bearing on it really.\nThe fact is that although I tend to work here late\n- and would undoubtedly be disturbed by\nrevelries on the Queen's Lawn - by and large\nthis place functions at the same time that most\nstudents are in classes. It's like a morgue most\nevenings.\nI just remember Angus Fraser switching off\nthe bands at the Rag Fete last year because he had an important businessman\nto see.\nWell, we had them this year. They wrote in\nadvance very properly and my attitude was that\nI can bare loud music for one afternoon!\nij th \u00a9 u tod] ita[| ff li( BL7g\u00aeL7\nThe influx of medical students and research\nto the South Kensington campus may represent one of the greatest opportunities\nfor rejuvenation and growth that Imperial\nhas seen in living memory. But is.the\nmerger too ambitious, considering the\nmixture of new buildings and changes to\nthe estate, the new course structure and\npreviously antagonistic student bodies?\nNo. Next question? [laughs]\nNot at all?\nNo.\nHas anywhere else tried the\n' medical scientist' course\nstructure?\nYes... a variety of places. But\nour aim is to develop a curriculum which actually leapfrogs over the other medical schools. The\ndoctors produced by our medical school will be\nlet loose on the population in the later part of\nthe first decade of the next century and the one\nthing you can say for sure is that medical\npractice is going to be phenomenally different\nthen.\nA modern doctor has got to face a quite\nbewildering range of problems. He's got to be\nan enormous genera list, highly dependant on\nfec hn ology in a whole range of ways.\n[For example] diagnostic ally in the form of\nimaging, in respect to chemical testing and in\nthe use of information technology in diagnostic\ndecision making. [Diagnosis and safe drug\nprescription] is a heaven sent opportunity for an\nexpert system.\nYou could argue that it would be better for\ndoctors to be more socially aware rather\nthan scientifically aware, because the\nexpert system will remove some of the\nnecessity for technical knowledge.\nNow that's dangerous! Anyone who works\nwith technology has got to know its practical\nlimitations and that involves having some\nunderstanding of the system. They must work\nwith an attitude that I can best describe as\n'informed scepticism'.\nIs the gradual phasing in of students to the\nBasic Medical Sciences building an attempt\nto prevent them becoming St. Mary's students or Charring Cross' students?\nNot particularly. If we are to achieve the\nbenefits we are looking for with having an\nintake of 250 students rather than the 100 we\nhave with Mary's, then we have to have them in\none place.\n\"I would be entirely\nhappy if a way could\nbe found to start\ntaxing all\ngraduates...\"\nP \u00a9 0 3 (Hood] P9LD(IIDQ(3\u00a93\nYou have said that you do not have a problem 'in principle' with top-up fees. But\nwould you concede that fees may lead to\nwould be students from less well off\nfamilies avoiding Imperial and, if so, how\nwill you overcome this?\nIt would be very undesirable if that were to\nhappen and so the only way I could conceive of\nus introducing top-up fees would be to\nintroduce a scheme of scholarships and\nbursa ries in parallel.\nBut presumably the fees are introduced\nbecause there is a problem with money - if\nthe money doesn't come from fees then it\nwould have to come from somewhere else?\nBasically, the top-up\nfees would have to be\napplied differential ly okay, it's not as efficient as\nif you charge everyone the\nmaximum top-up fee but I think that would be both\nsocially and academically\nunjustifiable.\nSo in that case you would still be forced to\nlook elsewhere for funds?\nI'm not sure what we would do but anything\nwhich actually discouraged people from coming\nto Imperial on the grounds of cost would not be\nacceptable.\nWould a graduate tax be acceptable to\nyou?\nEntirely.\nWould you be happy to pay a graduate tax\nyourself?\nI would be entirely happy if a way could be\nfound to start taxing all graduates - certainly\neveryone who is in the 40% tax bracket.\nIs that likely to happen?\nI can't judge. I have no idea whether it\nwould be practicable. Any tax, if it is to be\neffective and fair, has to be collectable and I don't know how collectible such a tax would be.\nYour first problem is you have to identify\neveryone who is a graduate. You can start with\npeople who are going through the system but\nideally I'd like to catch people of my own\ngeneration and earlier.\nPresumably people would start arguing\nthat they didn't really benefit from their\ntime at university.\nAh, no you don't allow that. You say that if\nyou are earning a rather low salary then you\nare either choosing not to benefit financially, by\nworking in some lowly paid but important\nactivity - for example teaching - or you are\nearning well and you are what you are because,\nwhether you believe it or not, you are a university graduate and we're going to judge\nyou as having benefited so you can jolly well\npay.\nIlTTT FELIX2 I JUn95 "

    "content": "News\nMedical Miasma\nImperial College Security have now admitted that the newly installed passive\ninfra-red (PIR) detectors in the Department of Computing failed during a raid on the William Penney Lab two weeks ago, writes Rachel Walters.\nThey had earlier claimed that the system functioned perfectly when two youths\nbroke into the research area in the early hours of June2 nd( FELIX1032). It\nnow appears that although the break-in was unsuccessful, it was only\nprevented due to the vigilance of a nearby security guard. Security gave chase,\nand two suspects were subsequently arrested.\nKeith Reynolds, Head of Security, explained: \"fortuitously one of our\nguys happened to be on the Chem Eng walkway system and heard the glass\ngo, so he radioed and we were there probably nearly as damn quick as if the\nPIR had gone anyway.\"\nPreviously, Terry Briley, Deputy Head of Security, had told FELIX\nthat the successful handling of the incident was due to the PIR detectors. He\nhad said that he was encouraged that the new security measures were proving\nto be effective.\nNews in Brief\nWell done Mark!\nImperial College Union( ICU)\nstaff have been full of praise for\nMark Home, this year's new\nEnt's Manager, after the sell-out\nsuccess of last Friday's end of\nterm carnival. ICU looks likely to\nmake up to \u00a31500 from the\nnight's festivities: \" Of course, it\nwill all be ploughed right back in\nto provide even better student\nservices,\" Mark stressed.\nThe transformation of the\nconcert hall into a Whirl-y Gig\n'experience' proved a particularly\nbig hit, and helped the Union to\npack in 1250 punters, the\nmaximum legal capacity of the\nbuilding. The only sour note\ncame as the clock approached\n3am. Smoke detectors set the fire\nalarms off and the revellers had to\nJIM FELIX2 u ung s be evacuated from the building\nten minutes before closing time.\nWell done Bob!\nImperial biologist Robert May has been appointed as the\nGovernment's new Chief\nScientific Adviser. Professor May,\n59, is a Royal Society research\nprofessor who divides his time\nbetween the zoology department\nof Oxford and our own institute\nof pure and applied biology at\nSilwood Park.\nThe government position,\nwhich includes heading up the\nOffice of Science and\nTechnology, will see Professor\nMay reporting directly to the\nMinister for Science. He will also\nbe charged with coordinating the\nactivities of all the other chief\nscientists in each of the relevant\ngovernment departments.\nMr May's current interests\nBY ANDREW SMITH The much vaunted new Basic\nMedical Science (BMS) building,\nplanned to be completed by April\n1998, faces further delays in the\napproval of the \u00a340million public\nsector contribution to its\nfunding. It had been hoped that\nfull approval would have been\ngained by Easter, especially given\ntwo senior cabinet ministers'\npublic support for the project.\nMonday 19 June saw a high\nlevel Treasury delegation of\nsenior civil servants travelling to\nImperial College for discussions\nwith Dr Rodney Eastwood,\n('Cash Crisis' continues)\nhave regularly forged claims for\nup to thirty nine hours extra\novertime. With ICU paying for\nthe wages of the employee's whole section as one bill, the\nexcess would not have been\nimmediately detected.\nIt was when the overtime\nsheets were checked, just before\nEaster, the discrepancies were\nuncovered. FELIX understands\nthat the employee originally used\nphotocopies of authentic time\nsheets. After college brought in\nenhanced security measures the\nemployee seems to have obtained\nstamps from the drawer of the\ninclude theoretical immunology\nand biological diversity and he is\nkeen to continue his work in\nthose fields, as well as commuting\nhimself to his new posting.\nWell done Mary!\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School is a shining example of\nmedical research, according to the\nnew Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals\nreport. 'Universities and the\nHealth of the Nation' presses for\ncontinuing investment in the staff\nand resources of medical schools\nto encourage medical care\nadvances as a result of technical\ninnovations.\nThe Department of\nPediatrics anti-meningitis programme and the clinical gene\ntherapy research of Professor Bob\nWilliamson came in for particular\npraise. His department produced\nCollege's Deputy Managing\nDirector. His team hopes to\ndissuade the Treasury, who must\napprove all Department of\nHealth ( DoH) capital grants,\nfrom pursuing their desire to test\nthe BMS under a 'Private\nFinance Initiative'. This scheme\nattempts to save public sector\nmoney for essential projects.\nOn the question of whether a public announcement can be\nexpected in the near future, Dr Eastwood asserted that he was\n\"very hopeful that it will be\nforthcoming very shortly\" but he\ncommented wryly: \"it's always\nimminent\".\nDeputy President Clubs &\nSocieties, Ian Parish.\nExpressing dismay at the\nevents, Lucy Chothia, ICU President, stressed that they\ncould not be repeated. \"We've\nhad a full review of the Union pay\nstructure and measures have been\nimplemented to ensure that this\nwill not happen again,\" she\ninsisted.\nThe employee, almost\nuniversally liked throughout the\nUnion, was initially suspended\nbut subsequently resigned\npending an expected prosecution\non charges of false accounting.\nthe first fully-reported trial for\ncystic fibrosis, representing a significant step in the search for a cure for the disease.\nRCS enter Forbidden Land\nThe impending demolition of\nRCSII has raised a problem for\nRoyal College of Science Union,\nas their hallowed office is\ncontained within its walls. The\nsoon to be displaced souls that are\nthe RCS hacks will now be in the\nunfortunate position of spending\nmost of their time in a City and\nGuilds building.\nThe new C CU office, and the\ngarage of the fire engine Jez, are\nto be in the Department of Civil\nEngineering but it seems that\nCollege didn't give them much of\nan option. Apparently it was\neither take what was offered or it\nwould be presumed that the RCS\nno longer required office space.\n\n"

Do you feel\ncrime is getting out of control?\nI don't think it is out of control, but I think\nit's a serious problem. We have such a concentration of high value equipment that we\nare forced to take a series of measures which\nwill, I'm afraid, to some extent inhibit our\nfreedom in the use of the campus and also cost\nus quite a lot of money.\nSo you do appreciate that security may\nbecome over-tight?\nAbsolutely. It is one of the challenges of\nmodern society; the more prevalent individuals\nwithin that society who are not prepared to\nabide by the rules, the more you have to inhibit\nthe freedom of the majority in order to stop the\nminority doing undue damage to the system. It\nis very sad.\nI 've heard that measures such as spot\nchecks are being discussed.\nWell I 've not heard that discussed.\nAh. [laughs]\nNo, I'm mostly talking about keeping things\nlocked up.\nTo what extent should the defence of\ntradition be put before sense and practicality when dealing with the minimal\nstudent interest in the CCU's and increasing\napathy towards the politics of ICU?\n[laughs] Answers on two sides of paper\nplease...\nWhen I was wording this question I was\nattempting to angle it so that you would\nfeel qualified to speak.\n[long pause]\nI think there is not a single answer and you\nreally have to play each bit of it by ear. I have\nseen many situations where bureaucrats have\ncome in and made trivial savings at the expense\nof a great deal of goodwill, simply through\nbeing insensitive to things which people -perhaps irrationally - valued very highly.\nEqually there are some things which, given the\nfinancial pressures we may be under - [you\nhave to put to people] whether it is a department head or a Constituent College Union or\nwhat have you - \"I know you've been doing this\nfor fifty years but this is what it's costing us and\nthis is what it's costing you\".\nOn another point, should the degree always come before everything else at\nuniversity.\n[Thinks a moment] I think that's a decision\nwhat every student has to make for himself.\nOkay. Do you think that more work always produces a better all round graduate?\nIt depends what sort of work.\n[After hammering out a consensus as to\nwhat question we are talking about]\nThe reputation that this college has - and I think it must maintain - is for producing first\nclass graduates in their specialist fields. But it is\nbecoming progressively less satisfactory to think\nthat is all that matters. The justification for the\nsort of full-time residential degree course that\nwe and the other older universities offer [has to\nbe] to provide an\nenvironment where people\ncan get an exceptional\ndegree of technical\nexpertise and have the\nopportunity to develop the\nother sides of their\ncharacter as well.\nShould these opportunities come from within\nthe curriculum or outside\nof it?\nBoth really. There are a lot of opportunities for\npeople who want them:\nrunning FELIX, doing one\nof the jobs for ICU,\norganising a club or display\nor a meeting. This is the\nkind of experience that\nemployers are interested in\nand it is probably better\ngained outside the curriculum. Self-expression and\ntechnical communication\ncan in part be gained from\noutside but it is actually\nsomething that you can\naddress within the curriculum. I have an initiative in\nits early stages at the\nmoment to do just that - it\nhappens to be something\nabout which I feel very\nstrongly indeed.\nDo you hope to see increasing awareness\nof the communication of scientific ideas\nfrom scientists at Imperial?\nYes I do. Without qualification. Yes.\nDo you have an all-encompassing vision of\nImperial College's place in the next\nmillennium and for how long do you hope\nto be part of it?\nOh, my contract expires in 1999, so I think I won't make it into the next millennium. On the\nother hand, what the college does will inevitably\nbe affected by what we do now.\n\"Ultimately - yes, I am the\nperson who is\nresponsible for the way\nthat money is spent\"\nI can see a number ot major scientific\nchallenges over the next decade. One is the\nwhole health and biochemical area - we talked\nof some of them - those are unbelievably\ndifficult areas which are going to become\naccessible for the very very first time. I think that\nthe opportunities are both tremendous and\nterrifying and I think the college will be\ninevitably deeply involved.\nAnother will be the interaction of human\nbeings with the environment. The number of\npeople alive today is exactly twice that when I was a student, and that is pretty terrifying. If the\nplanet is to remain habitable and we are not to\nperturb it unwittingly by our own activities then\nwe have to understand how the planet works. I can see some of the effort of almost every\ndepartment feeding into a major college effort\nin that area too.\nThese themes - which are inter-disciplinary\ninterdepartmental themes - will achieve a much\ngreater prominence than in the past. I imagine\nthat we will go into the next century with\nbroadly the same structure of undergraduate\ndepartments that we have today but probably\nwith continually changing and more mobile\ninter-disciplinary graduate centres. Individual\nstaff members may well do their teaching in an\nundergraduate department but actually do their\nresearch in an inter-disciplinary department\nsome way away.\nA set of umbrella centres or 'missions' on\ntop of the current departments?\nThat's right. That's one way in which we will\ndevelop. And I'd like us to have a greater\ndegree of financial stability then we have now.\nImperial College is rather like a Rolls-Royce with\na mini-sized gas tank. What comes in is what\ngoes out and we have no reserves. We basically\nhave to live on our wits.\nPresumably that takes up more of your\ntime then you'd like?\nWell there are only so many hours in the day\nand one does have to think about that.\nWould you like to see more women at\nImperial and do you think it's possible?\nSure. The medical school will change the\nproportion to some extent. It is part of the\ncollege plan that we will continue to increase\nthe number of women in the college. A progressively greater proportion of those who\nget higher grades at 'A' level are women and it\nmay be that they filter through anyway. But we\nmust maintain our efforts of trying to\ncommunicate some of the excitement and\nchallenge of science to kids at school. 5\nFELIX\n\n"

Not\nbecause I long to leave but\nbecause I long to arrive. I covet\nthe excitement, and I enjoy seeing\nnew, often temporary, Londoner's disembark. With their heavy\nproportion of non-metropolitans,\nthese modern day Border Marches\nprovide a far more immediate and\naccessible interface to the\nrelationship between London and\nthe lands she rules over than the\nslow watering down of a trip to\nthe edge of the endless suburbs.\nIf I were rich I'd like to leave\nLondon in a private helicopter. Air\ntraffic control would be the special\nsound of my favourite place,\ntogether with the noise and taste\nof the wind rushing past the\nroughly sealed window with the\nforce of a speeding brick. The city\nwould spread out beneath me like\nlike the computer graphics that\nare periodically used before\n'London Tonightesque' television\nprogrammes and the whole city\nwould be allowed to qualify as my\nfavourite place.\nIt's Friday 7.00am on June\n16th and I 've been up all night\nediting news reviews and writing\nfanciful columns to my short-lived\nwandering past. I would like right\nnow to feel a little queasy in one\nof my places, because it's so early\nand because I don't drink coffee\nand so am forced to have an early\nmorning coke. I'd like to be\nwatching the night-people and\nday-dwellers mix and I'd like to be\ngoing and returning.\nLike most of Earth's people,\nmy roots migrated to the city, and\nits gates are precious to me. 0\nLast time pavement came to play,\nit was a wash out. Slackers by\nnature, they seemed ill at ease\nonstage and proceeded to muffle\ntheir way through one of the worse\ngigs I 've seen. Last week at Brixton\nAcademy it was a different tune; all\nhail the conquering heroes as\nPavement returned upmarket and\nblew away all our expectations.\nSongs from current album,\n'wow eez owe e', were spliced with\nmore than the odd one or two from\n'crooked rain crooked rain' -Stephen J. Malkmus choosing to\nopen with the an the mic 'silence\nkit'. \"Your sister cursed, your\nfather's only damned now,\" he\nsang and it summed up both the\nband's inherent meaning, or was\nthat absurdity? 'Fight this genera-tion' was another case in question.\nHappy to sing along, we weren't sure whether we were indicting\nourselves and we sure didn't care\neither.\nPerhaps they played too few of\nthe new ones and relied too much\non singles like 'cut your hair' and\n'heaven is a truck' (excluding the\nline about the Smashing Pumpkins\nbut with added AC/DC instead!)\nbut these were so good, such\ncriticism smacks of churlishness.\nThey finished, far too soon, with the\nancient 'summer babe' before\ncoming back as the wacky\nPavement of old.\nDrummer Steve West swapped\nplaces with Stephen J, second\ndrummer-come-madman Bob put a random face mask on and the\nrecombined band staggered into\naction with such misplaced\nenthusiasm you had to smile. For a couple of songs they even looked\nlike they were enjoying it as much\nas the audience.\nIt must be weird being soul\nasylum. One minute you're\nnobodies, barely breaking even\nafter twelve years then you're\nreleasing your seventh Ip. It's more\npolished, yet still full of great songs\nand it contains one about\nrunaways; the best song Tom Petty\ncould never write. Next minute\nyou're on mtv so much you're tired\nof seeing your own face, the Ip's selling in millions and the world is\npreparing itself for the follow-up...\nSo, does it deliver? Pretty\nmuch. Believe it or not, /et your dim\nlight shine is even more commercial\nthan 'grave dancers union' and it's quite clear that Dave Pirner is far\nlot more comfortable pretending to\nbe Tom Petty than he ever was\nplaying Bob Mould. 'Misery' is a great opener, picking up where\nthey left off with a gentle refrain\nand a soaring chorus. Elsewhere\nthe likes of 'shut down' and their\nsole moment of punk asylum,\n'caged rat', remind us that they can\nstill rock, while 'to my own devices'\nremind us that they can chill too.\nPersonally, I would like to have\nseen more of the former and less of\nthe latter but I guess the majority of\nthe hungry hordes wouldn't. Pirner\nleaves us with a parting shot of 'I did my best'. Hopefully, that's still\nto come.

If\nyou can begin to contemplate what\nMetallica would sound like if the\nSisters of Mercy wrote their songs\nthen you're some way to knowing\nwhat this record sounds like. In the\nmain they've weaved dark\ntapestries built on huge guitar riffs\nand enveloped in a dark, creeping\natmosphere. Recent single, 'the last\ntime', and 'shadow kings' are more\ntraditional chug-a long metal\naffairs but that menacing, almost\nclaustrophobic ambience still\npervades. An impressive, if depress-ive, achievement. (7)\nTherapy?' s latest album,\ninfernal love, sees them in a playfully ironic mode; at least on\nthe album cover.

And\nit's a situation which is reflected to\nsome degree on the album too as\ncurrent single and title track,\n'stories', appeared surprisingly\nweak to my delicate ears.

    "content": "Incoming\nAnswering back! The final words of the year... Edited this week by Marcus Alexander\nE quality... ... Maybe\nFreedom?\nDear Felix,\nI feel that I have to write in response to Farida Begum's letter last\nweek, about freedom of speech.\nThis is however a very difficult\nissue to tackle. The policy run by\nICU and by most student unions is\nnot anti-freedom of speech, it's an\nanti-racist issue.\nI can't comment on the ICU\nIslamSoc meetings which have\nbeen cancelled, I only know that\nthey are not cancelled at whim, but\nonly with good reason after much\nconsideration by the Union Office\nand security. After the events of\nthe beginning of the year, so\naccurately reported in FELIX in the\nautumn term, where King's College\nJewish Society students had to be\npolice escorted off their campus,\nafter a meeting of King's College\n\"Current affairs\" Society was\ncancelled, I would very much hope\nthat similar does not occur here.\nIn my position as Jewish Society\nChair there are many safeguards I need to adhere to to protect the\nmembers, and there are many\nevents which we do not hold\nbecause of the fear of racist\ngroups. Before we have a meeting\nwe are supposed to check the\nroom, and all our publicity is not\nmeant to mention room places or\ntimes, we are meant to just tell the\npeople we know are coming. The\nMuslims at IC are in the \"minority\"\nof 2,000. Although I am not\nbranding anyone a fundamentalist\nor a racist, these people are active,\nand IC is on the NUS list of top ten\n\"fundamentalist hotbeds\" in the\ncountry. Whilst I have very very\nfortunately not had to incur'the\nordeal of taunts, daubing s and\nactual attacks incurred by many of\nmy colleagues, I have had posters\ntorn down pretty regularly. I would\nnot like to see this escalate further.\nThese people who cite \"freedom\nof speech\" generally, in their \"free\nspeech\" incite hatred against\nwomen, Hindus, Serbs, homosexuals and Jews, to name just a few. Whilst I am not saying that\nevery member of IslamSoc is\nassociated with Hizb-ut-tah rir, I would like to remind my friend that\neveryone's point of view needs to\nbe accounted for, and everyone's feelings taken into account.\nAlthough everyone does deserve\nthe right of freedom of speech,\neven more so everyone deserves\ntheir freedom of movement,\neducation, and religious or social\nbelief. That is what ICU policy was\ndesigned to ache ive. Sarah Waiman\nChem Eng 2\nICJS Chair 94-95\nCypriots are\nCypriots!\nDear Editor,\nFrom my having read \"Felix\"\nseveral times, I have formed the\nimpression that the students'\nweekly magazine does not cover\nany kind of British or International\npolitical issues. Therefore, people\nwriting in it do not need to be\nthoroughly informed on such\nmatters.\nThough intended to be a humorous, holiday article, Frank\nPoole's \"postcard from Cyprus\"\nbrings politics into one's mind.\nDoes he really believe that \"Cyprus\nis...the disputed territory of Greece\nand Turkey\"? Saying something as\nstupid as that, shows lack of\nknowledge of history and\ngeography to an unacceptable\ndegree. Someone should better\ninform Mr. Poole that Cyprus \"is\nmeant to belong\" to the Cypriots\nthemselves. It's typically a free\ncountry and does not belong as a whole or as a part neither to\nGreece, nor to Turkey. It seems like\nMr. Poole is not aware of the 1 974\nTurkish invasion to the\nundisputed ly Cypriot until then,\nisland of Cyprus. Turkey had been\ncondemned by the UN and\ncountless other international\norganisations for its actions in\nCyprus. Two thousand Cypriots\nwere lost, and are still after 20\nyears considered to be missing,\nalthough they have most probably\ndied in Turkish prisons. Obviously,\ntheir relatives do \"understand what\nis going on\". I wonder sometimes,\nhow many of the tourists spending\ntheir holidays in any of the\nnorthern coastal cities of Cyprus\nare aware of the fact that the\nCypriots were violently forced to\nabandon their properties there, in\nJuly 1974.\nPolitics as you probably know,\nmay involve some very sensitive\nissues. This careless, ignorant\narticle on Cyprus is a heavy insult,\nnot only to our Cypriot fellow\nstudents of the College, but to any\ndemocratic mind. If Mr. Poole\nwants to distinguish the country\ninto two parts, then he must\nsomehow understand that the\nnorthern one is under Turkish\noccupation and the southern is still\nfree. At least for the sake of Felix's neutral approach to any kind of\npolitics, the truth must be restored\nto the eyes of your readers. Some\npolitics in your magazine would not\nhurt as much as ignorance and\nindifference do.\nSincerely yours,\nSpyros Michas\nDear Felix,\nIt is with great interest that I read the articles on the social\nposition of men and women (Felix\n1032). Despite the differing\nperspectives on who is the true\nvictim of subjugation and prejudice,\none point seems to form the\ncommon denominator in the\narguments of all correspondents.\nThat is, whether one likes it or not,\nthe overwhelming trend in almost\nevery society at whatever stage of\ndevelopment is currently towards\nfurther emancipation of women\nand their increased participation in\nsociety.\nHowever, few people seem to\nhave considered other social\ntransformations that have\ntraditionally accompanied this\nprocess of liberalisation, namely\nchanges in sexual practices and\ntheir impact on family and personal\nrelationships. I am not aware of\nany society which has trodden the\nroad to modernisation and social\nreform without a simultaneous\nproliferation of promis cui o ty and\ndeterioration of the moral and\nethical norms that constitute the\nvery foundation of stable families.\nWhether this is a pure historical\ncoincidence or is in fact the product\nof a causal relationship is the\ncrucial question that has not yet\nbeen fully addressed.\nToday's western civilisation was\npreceded by that of the East. One\nof the fundamental differences\nbetween the two is in their\ntreatment of women; the former\npreaches freedom and equality of\nwomen, whereas the latter was\nbased on a system of values which\nsubordinated women to men, and\ndenied them many of the priv eli ges that men widely enjoyed. Yet,\nperhaps ironically, this civilisation\ngave birth to a culture that elevated\nthe status of women and attributed\nto them an almost divine and\nheavenly sanctity.\nHere indeed lies my dilemma.\nFreedom and equality of both men\nand women is, in my opinion, a moral imperative as well as a social\ninevitability. Yet I cannot help\nnoting that the western model of\nequality had been effected only at\na very high price, exterminating\nsome of the finest elements of the\nhuman spirit and destroying the\nfabric of stable and compassionate\nfamilies. Many of the traditional\nsocieties are only just beginning to\ngo down this road. Therefore: If\n[the western model] of equality of\nsexes is to culminate in such tragic\nending, shouldn't we think again\nabout it?\nYours sincerely,\nYasser Hatami (EE3)\nWhat everyone seems to forget\nwhen ranting on about the\nmale/female issue is that,\nunderneath it all, there are very\nfew differences between us. OK,\nthere are some obvious physical\ndifferences but as far as I am\nconcerned the rest are cultural. The\nissue of woman in science has\ninterested me. Girls are doing as\ngood as, if not better than, boys in\nscience in general, especially if you\nlook at last year's GCSE maths\nresults. Yet the proportion of\nwomen studying the 'hard' sciences\nis still very low. Why is this? Well\nFiona Duerden can rest assured\nthat the fault does not lie with the\nadmissions tutors, as a woman\napplying for these subjects is more\nlikely to be accepted than a man\n(UCCA statistics 1 994). The fact is\nthat girls aren't as interested in a career in science as the boys.\nWhy have we got into the whole\nmasculine/feminine stereotype\nanyway? Traditional roles are\ningrained into society but it wasn't always this way. Throughout the\nages, women have fought beside\ntheir men and even led them into\nbattle.\nOn the issue of positive\ndesc rim i nation, I certainly wouldn't want to think that I had only got a job because my employers needed\nto fill their quota of women.\nOK, I do have a gripe that finds\nin favour of feminism on one thing\ncovered by last weeks Felix and\nthat is the portrayal of women by\nthe media. Personally, it is not\noffensive just banal. One day they\nwill make well scripted big budget\nfilms in which the women don't continually have hysterics in the\nname of dramatic impact: we're\nnot completely incapable, even if\nwe are supposed to be the weaker\nsex.\nWhat I have been trying to say is\nthat if a crime has been committed\nagainst women then we were there\ncasting stones of our own. Are\nwomen really the guilt-free and\nhelpless victims in all of this? Think\nabout it and maybe you might\nbegin to see why I call myself an\nequal it arian and not a feminist.\nAnna Juvanen-Lettington\nBiology II\nOne letter writer asked that his\nletter not be cut; unfortunately this\nwas not possible. However, in\ninterests of equality all letters were\ncut to an equal length. Such is life.\nLetters maybe commented on by a guest editor, whose opinions are not necessarily\nthose of the editor, and cut\ndue to space restrictions.\n2\nI JUn05 FELIX MM\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nConstant Monitoring\nBig Brother is watching\nyou...\nAn influx of new technology seen\nin recent months has meant that\nsecurity are in a position to\nmonitor student activity more than\never before. The installation of a network of alarms and cameras\nhas lead to allegations that a socalled Big Brother system is being\ncreated.\nThe whole system of swipe\ncards was specifically introduced\nso that they could also operate as\nlibrary cards, for cash less catering,\nstudent voting or in association\nwith the sports centre. In Mr\nReynolds words: \"it was almost a smart card.\" But he insisted that\nthe constant monitoring of student\nactivity through the cards is some\nway off: \"it won't be done, or not\nwhile I 've got any say in it.\"\nSecurity do not keep records on\nstudents and apart from using\ndata for major investigations, all\ninformation is dumped after seven\ndays, he insists. Nonetheless, Terry\nBriley, his Deputy Head, has\nvoiced enthusiasm for the creation\nof a 'rogue's gallery' of offenders\nto keep track of errant students.\nBut Keith Reynolds dismissed the idea of a1984 type\nscenario insisting that he is not \"a great believer in putting cameras\nall over the place for no real\nreason\". He admits that he gets\nmore requests from departments\nfor closed circuit surveillance than\nhe thinks are appropriate.\nNew technology\nPIRs and dope-loving\nsmoke detectors\nRecent months have seen a massive up-grade in IC security\nfacilities. With the introduction\nof new technology, staff can be\nfreed to react to incidents rather\nthan wait for them to happen.\nBut the benefits that the\nhigh-tech equipment brings are\nquestioned by some security staff,\nwho point out that for a camera\nto be of any use in crime\ndetection, somebody has to\nconstantly look at the television\nmonitor. This problem will be\ncombated with a new camera\nsoon to be installed on the\nwalkway, which will be coupled\nwith an Passive Infra-Red (PIR)\ndetector so that movement would\nactivate it.\nBut the reliability of the\nnew PIRs is in doubt after the\nsystem failed to work just weeks\nafter it was installed. Mr Reynolds admits that the new\nPIRs in the William Penney Lab\ndidn't trigger, despite an outside\nwindow being broken and\nvarious computer equipment\nbeing tampered with. Describing\nthe incident as a 'malfunction'\nthe head of security insists that\nthis does not happen very often\nand that all the defective\nequipment was 'dumped'.\nThe new smoke alarms\ncontinue to be a cause of con ten tion. Introduced under government regulations, their installation was plagued with problems\nregarding their over sensitivity. Now students are complaining\nthat their ability to detect cannabis smoke over-intrudes into\nthe private lives of hall residents.\nWhile PC Coleman insists that\nthe public smoking of 'herbal\ndrugs' will be prosecuted, he\nsuggests that the police are not\ninterested in private cons ump tion. \"Whatever you do behind\nclosed doors is your business,\" he\nsaid, insisting that it was up to\ncollege, and hall wardens in particular, to deal with the\ndiscovery of small amounts.\nBesides, Mr Reynolds\nthinks that the new fire detection\nequipment has had little to do\nwith the twenty-five drug\ndiscoveries of recent weeks. He\nsays that the network of smoke\nalarms have only once resulted in\nthe seizure of illicit substances,\nand that most of those found\nhave been caught out by staff.\nStaff\n'Some are old, hard of\nhearing and they can't run'\nSome students have problems\nbelieving that security are\nphysically up to the job: many of\nIC security staff were originally\nemployed to deliver mail before\nthe job of 'messenger' was\nchanged to 'security guard' three\nyears ago. \"Some are old, hard of\nhearing, and they can't run,\" one\nstudent commented. In one case\nearlier this year an intruder was\nescorted by a postgraduate student to a manned security lodge,\nat which point the criminal escaped.\nMr Reynolds admits that\nsome of the original messengers\nmay not have fully adapted to\ntheir present role as security\nofficers. But he defends his staff:\n\"they have come a long way down\nthe new road and are quite good.\"\nHe suggests that the mobile\nresponse unit, always available to\nreact to incidents and containing\nthe younger, fitter elements,\nshould be able to cover any\npossible staff inadequacy.\nMr Reynolds also supports\nthe current minimum staffing\nlevels, insisting that a twelve man\nteam can staff the four fixed\npoints and 'put in a good\npatrolling system'. Justifying the\nstaff levels, the head of security\ncontends that a night shift of\nsixteen Imperial College Security\nguards is considerably more\npersonnel than Belgravia police\nstation has to cover the whole of\ntheir sector.\nThe overhaul of security\nstaffing in 1992 came after proposals to contract out the system\nwere defeated by a concerted\nprogramme of industrial action,\nand Mr Reynolds still insists that\nthe present security staff provide\nthe best service. Although some\nshort term financial advantage\ncould be achieved by putting the\nservice out to tender, the rapid\nturnover of personnel that would\ninevitably result would present a serious problem, he maintains.\nWith staff continuity being s tres sed, it seems that IC Security are\nsafe, for the foreseeable future at\nleast, from any more attempts to\nclose them down.\n2\nI JU I195 FELIX MM\n\n"

The NUS itself\nseemed willing, even eager, to\nwelcome back London's prodigal\ncollege with open arms but many\nstudents at Imperial were less\nthan enthusiastic.\nRepresentatives from the\nNUS courted ICU to explain the\nbenefits of re-affiliation, even\noffering a knock down affiliation\nfee of \u00a320,000 and an \u00a311,000\nsaving on beer to coax the\nKensington campus back into the\nfold. But that left a \u00a39,000\nshortfall - and there was also\nconcern that the NUS would\nconsider ICU' a feather in their\ncap' and that ICU's apolitical\nstand would be sullied by\naffiliation to a National Union\nnot renowned for its love of\nincumbent governments.\nA motion was presented to\ncouncil calling for a referendum.\nIt was defeated, but on a technicality: it was feared that a referendum would interfere with\nthe sabbatical elections which\nwere also due to take place in the\nSpring term. Council was though,\nin principle, in favour of the idea\nFELIX of a referendum.\nWhich brings us around to.\nTHE SABBATICAL ELECTIONS Elections, elections everywhere\nand lots and lots to drink - as\nresults night would show.\nWithin a week, gossip was\nspreading over who was standing\nfor what, especially given that\nfour members of the Elections\nCommittee had resigned citing\nconflict of interests. Papers went\nup, and rumours began to\nmetamorphose into fact. Down\nwent the papers two weeks later,\nwith only one candidate running\nunopposed.\nA deluge of posters hit\ncollege the following week, with\nnine candidates chasing four\nposts. Candidates advertised,\ncanvassed, campaigned, received\nflan s at Mary's, advertised,\ncanvassed and campaigned.\nMeanwhile a FELIX opinion\npoll showed a huge proportion of\nstudents who were 'undecided'.\nMore advertising, canvassing and\ncampaigning - until to spoil it all\nvoting time arrived.\nThe final result seemed to\nhave been swung by the fl anning medics, provoking a storm of\ncontroversy over Mary's voting.\nIt appeared that at the medical\nschool, 'sample voting slips' had\nbeen found amongst the ballots,\nindicative, perhaps, of a certain\nconfusion amongst the Mary's voters.\nThe really dramatic voting\nactually came a week later. At\nICU council, there was a real\npossibility that the s a bbs elect\ncould get a post-election kick in\nthe ballots. It seemed clear that\nin view of the way things had\ngone at Mary's with the sample\nballot papers, the constitutional\nrules governing the running of\nelections had been broken.\nA heated debate followed\nand a vote was taken. Fifteen\nmembers called for an electoral\nre-run, fourteen against. But the\nvotes were re-counted, and one\nmember actually changed his\ndecision, causing a fourteen-vote\nall draw. Council chair John\nDurrell had the casting vote and\nmanfully put everyone out of\ntheir misery.\nThe results were valid: Sarah\nWhite for President, Matt\nCrompton for Deputy President\n(Finance and Services), Tim Townend for Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies) and Rachel\nWalter returned as FELIX Editor and Print Unit Manager.\nWhich allowed us all to get\nback to...\nUS& THEN US( II)\nWith the sabbatical elections out\nof the way, the end of the Spring\nterm finally saw the decision to\nhold a vote on NUS affiliation.\nThough a lot of students didn't actually support joining, it was\nclear that the student body felt\nthey should be allowed to make\nthe decision for themselves.\nThe Summer term saw\ncampaigning across college once\nmore. The antiN US lobby,\nheaded by Sarah Thomas,\ncampaigned mainly on the\nfinancial implications to ICU as\nwell as the highly political nature\nof NUS activity; the pro-NUS\ncampaign, led by Stephen Webb\nand James Connolly fought their\ncorner on the benefits - financial,\nlegal and otherwise - that the\nNUS could bring to the student\nbody. From the beginning there\nwas concern on where both sides\nwere getting money - speculation\nwas especially rife over how the\nanti-camp were being funded.\nHustings were pathetically\nattended and there were fears\nthat the whole election would not\nbe valid (quo rate) through less\nthan the required 1000 students\ncould end up voting at all. To\nmake matters worse, the pro-campaigners were accused of\nusing illegal posters which carried no election dates on\nthem, and they started inviting\nNUS staff to speak at hustings;.\nMeanwhile the anti-campaign were accused of not\nactively encouraging people to\nvote in an attempt to render the\nelection invalid, and so winning\ntheir campaign passively. All the\nsame, the rule-flouting continued\n- overlooked as it was deemed\n' silly' to invalidate an entire\nreferendum purely because of a technicality.\nMore advertising, cam-pai g ning, canvassing.... but the\nwhole affair seemed in real\ndanger of soaring to fresh heights\nof bumbling ineptitude. By the\ntime voting came round, it\nseemed that the campaigns\ntogether with, perhaps, the\nissue's continual prominence in\nthe FELIX news pages, had led\nto sufficient numbers turning out\nfor the election to be quo rate. Sure enough 965 voted to stay\noutside the NUS, 696 voted to re-enter.\nReactions were varied; \"It\nwould be a great shame if the\nNUS had won in the light of the\ncampaign that was run,\" said\nDeputy President Dan Look.\nSarah Thomas felt the whole\nelection had \"turned into a farce\"\nand she was \"relieved that it was\nall over\". Oddly,80% of the\nmedics wanted to re-join, with\none of them saying that cheaper\nbeer prices were a good incentive.\nDOC RAIDED( AND\nAGAIN, AND AGAIN AND....) KCL, UCL and now IC's Computing Department suffered\nnumerous break-ins throughout\nthe first half of 1995, suffering\nthousands of pounds worth of\ntheft and damage. An early\nmorning raid in February cost\ncollege \u00a330,000, though the\nvigilance of postgraduate student\nprevented further damage. Soon\nanother gang of professional\nthieves struck, apparently\nstealing on order. This time\n\u00a38000 worth of RAM chips were\ntaken, with electrostatic damage\nreceived by the machines\nthreatening to massively increase\nthe repair bill. The intruder was\ncaught but fled before security\nbackup could arrive.\nTwo further raids occurred\nover Easter, with one criminal\nbeing chased but escaping, and\ndamage estimated at around\n\u00a370,000 this time.

One group was reported\nto have distributed anti-homo-sexual and anti-semitic leaflets in\nand around UL U. At King's College London's Fresher's Fair\nanother group was asked to leave\nwhen it was discovered they were\nreligious activists of Hizb u Tahrir ('Liberation Party').\nThese events prompted the\nUL U council to pass a motion\nreinforcing its \"stance against\nbigotry and prejudice from any\nsource\" and effectively pro-hi biting the distribution of\npotentially offensive literature.\nThe national organiser of one\ngroup had told the national press\nthat they had control of about\nfifty Islamic Societies nationwide\nand had amassed some 2000\nmembers.\nA week after\nthe UL U ban, an\nincident occurred at the\nSchool of Oriental and African\nStudies (SOAS).\nThe chair of the\nIslamic Society\n(and Hizb u Tahrir member)\nreportedly paid\ntribute to an\nMuslim suicide\nbomber causing\nmitte e to ban all speakers from\nthe group. Another incident\noccurred at KCL where it\nappeared that members of a rather vaguely titled 'Culture\nSociety' intended to disrupt a meeting of the Jewish Society.\n\"The disturbing atmosphere of\nthe meeting led to the decision to\ncall the Police,\" said KCL SU. Earlier, a member of IC's own Islamic Society had said of\nHizb u Tahrir, \"They are often\nquoted out of context,\" after\ninsisting that \"they not antisemitic or homophobic\". In\nmuch the same way, perhaps, as\nSir David Williams' Superleague\nwas non-existent...\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS With IC improving its links with\nuniversities in other countries -notably Thailand it seemed\nironic that the Foreign Office\ncould soon be turning away\nstudents from politically sensitive countries. In an attempt to\nhalt the proliferation of dangerous military hardware over-seas, especially nuclear weapons,\nstudents from ten countries could\nfind themselves being vetted by\nthe Government before being\nallowed to study in the UK. Dr. John Hassard of Physics\nwas critical of the scheme,\nbelieving that it was 'racist' and\nthat the UK was effectively\ntelling other countries that they\nweren't responsible enough to\nhave nuclear weapons. But\ndespite the scheme's appearance\nas an attempt to fix the stable\ndoor after the postdoc had bolted,\nto others the heavy-handed\ndiplomacy seems justified. The\nIraqi Nuclear Weapons Program\nwas set up by an ex-IC researcher\na SOAS corn-sufficiently offensive. Depicting\nthe Moors Murderers collecting\nfor a children's charity, it bore\nthe title 'Doing it for the kids'\nwhilst the highlight inside were\nphotographs of bizarrely mutilated genitalia. It was banned by\nUL U president Gemma\nWilliams, who said that IC Rag\nwould not be allowed to\ndistribute it on their premises;\nin 1979, and is currently headed\nby a former IC student.\nDOING WHAT FOR THE KIDS? IC's infamously indecent Rag\nMag provoked a storm of protest\nwhen it was published in November. Even the Rag chair\nIan Robertson admitted:\n\"Personally, I feel very offended\nby it.\"\nThe front cover alone was\nwithin a week it had been\nshunned by the unions of\nGoldsmith's, Royal Holloway and\nBedford, the LSE and KCL. But\nthe widespread cold-shouldering\nprobably did Rag a favour. That\nsame week the medical schools of\nSt Guy's, St. Thomas's and\nSt.George's were screaming out\nfor copies.\nTHE STUDENT MOANS COMPANY The beleaguered Student Loans\nCompany ( S LC), by now\nseasoned in the art of stumbling\nineptly into the spotlight for all\nthe wrong reasons, once again\nfound itself in the news. A confidential D FE document was\nleaked to the Guardian detailing\nthe proposed privatisation of the\nS LC. The Committee of ViceChancellors and Principals was\nunrelenting in their fierce\ndisapproval of the S LC, saying\nthat the repayment mechanism\nwas wrong: \"If the Government\nhad got the repayment scheme\nright in the first place, the banks\nwould have taken it.\"\nA few weeks later the S LC had a new Chief Executive. Sir\nEric Ash, a former Rector of IC\nand a non-Executive S LC director since September 1994,\nwas drafted in to head the\ntroubled company. The S LC chairman told FELIX:\" His management experience will be\nan invaluable asset.\"\nSoon Sir Eric, an avid\nproponent of e mail at Imperial,\nhad put the S LC on the Internet.\nThis great bid for student\nequality allowed techno hippies and cyberpunks to 'flame' the\nSLC as easily as anyone else. Just\ne mail s lc@ cuckoo-land.in com... THE BE IT FIGHT A postdoc had\nhis jacket and\nwallet stolen,\nwith onlookers\nsuspecting three males\nwho were later\nconfronted by\na technician in\nthe Quad; a fight ensued in which all six union stewards\nattempted to subdue the pro-tag on is ts, after which four of the\nstewards required hospital treat-ment. The resulting deficiency of\nstewards meant that staff from a private security company would\nbe deployed in their place.\nThere were also allegations\nof an IC security officer drinking\nwhilst on duty. Security said that\ntwo officers had been on duty\nthat night; certain eye-witnesses\nclaimed that only one officer was\nseen. Terry Briley, Deputy Head\nof Security, said he was shocked\nat the notion of security men\ndrinking on the job.\nAnd there was more doubt\nover when police had been called,\nand whether Security sent for\nthem when the stewards had\nasked. It was also unclear why\nSecurity - though attending to\nthe injured - had not been\nfurther involved at an earlier\nstage. Security felt that, as the\npolice had been contacted as soon\nas the violence started, then it\nwas the police whose actions\nshould be scrutinised.\nPolice actually appeared on\nthe scene at 3am, after the three\nassailants had left the fray; so if\nthe police had been slow in their\nreaction, then the actions of the\nsecurity guards were above\ncriticism in this regard.

    "content": "News Review\nNews Rewind\nComputer thefts, campaigning, the NUS, KCLSUand the mysterious CVCR...\nA un indy aS in ha ray, staunch news team member, takes a last look at the issues that\nexcited and dismayed Imperial during the 1994/95 session.\nImperial College (IC)\nsauntered into another\nacademic year with the\nnews that Da Vinci's ceiling had sprung a leak; but\ndespite the good humour of\nwatching two s a bbs plugging\nthe holes with their fingers,\nmore ominous news was\nawaiting the first issue of the\nterm...\nSt.Mary's Medical School\nhad sauntered into financial\nscandal when Cyril D 'Souza, a hospital cashier and self-confessed gambler was found to\nhave personally spent more than\n\u00a3600,000 of Mary's money. Mr. D 'Souza was charged in February\n1995 and was sentenced last\nmonth to five years imprison-ment.\nFRESHER S' WEEK Any sauntering was quickly\nreduced to inebriated staggering\nas Fresher's Week went into\naction, though with less than\namusing consequences. 'Over-enthusiastic behaviour' occurred\nat the New Year Carnival when\nabout thirty of the fresher s decided to share the stage with\none of the Bands performing in\nthe Union Ents lounge.\nThe new first years were\nclearly going to be more of a handful than was thought.\nWithin days, one had provided a test of Beit Hall's Fire Alarms\nafter smoking dope. His subsequent caution and fine only\nhinted at the un salubrious activities that Beit Quad would\nhost later in the year.\nIS IT A BIRD? IS IT A PLANE? NO, IT'S A SUPERLEAGUE No sooner does IC announce its\nintended merger with the\nNational Heart and Lung Institute than it also seems to\nhave become a member of the\n'Russell Group', a clutch of elite\nuniversities whose high-ranking\ndenizens skulked secretively in a hotel of the same name.\nConsisting of the likes of Oxford,\nCambridge, University College\nLondon and the London School\nof Economics (and us, of course)\nthe Russell Group 'broke away' to\nform a 'superleague' of colleges,\nraising fears that\nthey were intent\non claiming the\nbest students\nand research\ncontracts. But said Sir David Williams, chancellor of Cambridge University: \"there is no\nsuperleague and\nnone envisaged...\nwe are an informal group with\nsimilar interests, set up for the\nprotection of the research\nstrengths of leading universities.\"\nIt subsequently emerged that the\nRussellers actually first rode out\nfrom IC itself, under the lead of\nSir Eric Ash. But Imperial's current rector, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, was keen to downplay\nthe story, saying that sensational\njournalism had exaggerated the\nwhole affair. All the group aimed\nto do, said Sir Ronald, was to\ndemonstrate the merits of the\npresent system of selective\nfunding by lobbying politicians\nand the like.\nMERGERS,' MYSTERY AND SUSPENSE The acquisition of the National\nHeart & Lung Institute was only\nthe first in host of transplants\nplanned for the next few years.\nThe next phase would involve\nSt.Mary's merging with Charing\nCross & Westminster Medical\nSchool, along with the Royal\nPostgraduate Medical School.\nThe results of these mergers\nwould require the construction of\na Basic Medical Sciences\nbuilding, next to the Chemistry\ndepartment.\nThe BMS project, originally\ncosted at \u00a372m, was then\ndownsized to \u00a362m. The involvement of medical students\nopened the possibility of funding\nfrom the Department of Health;\nthe medical section would be\nfinanced 100% by external\nsources, and HE FCE would fund\n25% of the Biology section, an\nextra \u00a312m coming from IC itself.\nIn pure money terms, no hassles.\nBut would that be the whole\nstory? Not only would there be\nan extra 1000 students on the\nSouth Kensington site, there are\nalso the required leisure and\naccommodation facilities to\nconsider as well. Part of the 'Old\nChemistry' department - featuring some very old panelled\nlecture theatres, the RCSU office\nand the RCS Motor Club - is\nphysically in the way too. The\nsolution: Demolition. \"But we\nwill re-house them somewhere,\"\nassured the Estates Division. With HE FCE sure to refuse the\nconstruction of replacement\nlecture theatres, whilst other\ntheatres in college run way under\ncapacity, chemists being lectured\nin other departments seems a real\npossibility. All Estates would say\nwas that studies were in progress\nto see what could be done to\nremedy the situation.\nThe R CSU could be\noffice less, their motor club left\ngarage less and chemists could be\nleft lecture theatre less; to some\nthe whole scheme seemed utterly\nmindless. Many were decidedly\nunimpressed with the project's organisation, or lack thereof. Dr.\nBrian Levitt of Chemistry,\nconsidering the lecture lecture\nproblem, sarcastically muttered:\n\" All this is a brilliant example of\nplanning.\"\nStill, come May, \u00a320m was\npromised mysteriously from\nHE FCE for the BMS building:\nodd because they never formally\ndeclared any funding. Virginia\nBottomley, the Secretary of State\nfor Health, announced the\nfunding in a press release. But\nIC's Planning Division sought to\ndownplay suggestions that all the\nmoney was in the pipeline,\ninsisted it still depended on the\nDepartment of Health producing\n\u00a320m. We clearly have a long way\nto go.\nTHE RUSSELL GROUP( JUST WHEN YOU\nTHOUGHT IT WAS\nSAFE...) And there's more (Sensation-al is m? Us?). The student union\nat LSE set up what it called the\n' Aldwych Group' to protect\nstudents interests in Sir David's non-existent superleague -including union officials from\nIC, LSE and other (yes...) 'elite'\nuniversities. Their first meeting\nwas held at IC on the 1st November. But, to complicate\nthings further, a more-elite-than-elite group had emerged within\nthe elite superleague of elites.

The ambitious application for National\nLottery funding was not among\nthe 83 selected projects announced last Thursday.\nThe rejection is part of an\nongoing procedure to determine\nwhich projects will gain a share\nof the Commission's \u00a31.6 billion\nbudget. The Albertopolis proposal would have created a huge\npedestrian precinct and underground shopping mall beneath\nExhibition Road, connecting\nprominent local museums with\nImperial College. But as Mike El rich of the Millennium Commission explained to\nFELIX, the planners: \"were\nunable to show us that it was the\nbest use of the Millennium money, from both a financial and\ntechnical point of view\".\nThe Commission based its\nchoices on a stringent set of\ncriteria. Successful applicants\nproduced proposals that were\nenvironmentally sound, of exceptional architectural quality and\nlikely to receive public backing.\nProviding a lasting monument to\nmark the millennium was\nanother high priority. \"Projects\nhave to show us that they cut the\nmustard,\" Mr Elrich said.\nHe emphasised that ideal\nproposals were ones that would\nbe of genuine benefit to the\ncommunity. \"They've got to\nmean something to people,\" he\ninsisted. Many of the bids which\nhave been short-listed are based\naround urban re-development\nand recreation plans.\nFurther sets of proposals to\nearn a slice of the National\nLottery winnings will be considered next September. Those\nwhose plans have been unsuccessful are advised to go away and\nrethink their schemes.\nMr Elrich suggested that the\nhuge cost of the Albertopolis\nproposal may have proved its\ndownfall. The scheme required a sum of \u00a3100 million, but the\nMillennium Commission has\nonly \u00a3350 million to distribute in\nthis round of awards. \"They need\nto scale it down a bit, and make it\nmore people orientated,\" he\nadvised.\nBY ANDREW SMITH A member of Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) staff has departed\nunder a cloud of suspicion, after\nan estimated \u00a37,000 has been\nfound missing from the Union\ncoffers.

Connected with the\nevent is a move to commemorate\nthe department's first professor,\nAugust Wilhelm Hofmann, by\n(putting up a blue plaque on\nI the house he lived in during 20\nI years in London,\nj Hofmann was born in the\n: German town of Giessen,\nfamous for its school of organic\nchemistry. He originally studied\nphilosophy and law, but realised his mistake and\nenrolled instead to study chemistry.\nHofmann's great interest was IN the components of coal tar, a by prod small square chamber connected with the c him! ney flue. There were no stink closets except the:\ncovered part of a large sand-bath heated with \\\ncoke\". i. Although the College was highly respected,\nit found its industrial sponsors uneasy at the\nprospect of a long wait for j applicable results. In 1 853, j lacking funds, it was absorbed \\\nby the Royal School of Mines,\nWhich amalgamation later j became Imperial College. J Despite his academic achievements, Hofmann's true talent was as\na teacher and enthuse r in chemistry. A student:\nwrote: \"Hofmann had a marvellous power of\nstimulating his students and of\nuc t of the coal gas industry | n1853, he became director imparting to them his own\nwhich was usually dumped in; of the Royal College of enthusiasm . Exhibiting ex ate Chemistry, which later\nrivers. In the mid 1800's,! Hofmann showed that several\ningredients of coal tar were\nrelated to ammonia. This\nj seemingly esoteric feat inspired very practical\nadvances in the dyeing industry. Compounds\n^classified by Hofmann were later used in the\n\u2022 production of red, mauve, blue\ni and violet dyes.\nMeanwhile in Britain,\nHenry de la Beche and others\nwere pushing for a chemistry\nj college, and Hofmann was recommended to oversee Britain'sI first College of Chemistry. After overcoming ini-it i al uncertainties about English life, he stayed in\ni London for 20 years.\nThe College's laboratories,\nset up in rooms on Oxford\nStreet, were somewhat rudi-ment ary.A student of\nHofmann's wrote later: \"the\nfirst public laboratory I worked\nin was the Royal College of\nChemistry in Oxford Street in 1853 to 1856.

Magpie weeps an elegy for tank girl.\nStylus hits the road, back and won't come back no more, no\nmore, no more. Errr so that's that then - the last of our\nlondon columns.\nWhen pavement took Brixton Academy by storm, tintin was\n^ ^ - ^ there. Later on he went home and caught up on the new\nI2I albums from therapy? and the beastie boys. Vile chimed in\nwith soul asylum and paradise lost.\nrotation regular he/en-/ou is e( first year chem) links up with\nthe curiously named spud nik( first year elect eng but for how\nmuch longer?), and together they give those discs a spin.\n^ | losing tracks, firing blanks\npast top of the bottoms\nQuite what Shakespeare would\nthink of some of his current\nincarnations is open to question.\nPersonally I like to think that what\nwould worry him far more is the\nridiculous reverence that we still\nseem to universally afford him.\nMaybe the case for 'unadulterated\nbard-dom' can be sustained for\nsuch serious plays as Macbeth and\nHamlet, but his comedies were\nsurely designed to be funny, not\nbound up in conservatism.\nIt's a fact that, thankfully,\nhasn't escaped the notice of\ndram soc. After their production of\nHamlet earlier in the year, last\nweek saw their latest Shakespearian offering, a customised\nand original rock and roll version\nof a midsummer night's dream.\nInstead of the usual thespian\npronouncements concerning the\nmixed up emotions of the mortals;\nhow Helena loves Demetrius loves\nHermia loves Lysander loves\nHermia but can't marry her etc,\nwe get the usual thespian\npronouncements shot through\nwith the odd burst of Roy\nOrbison's 'only the lonely' or Patsy\nCline's 'crazy'. It makes for quite\nan interesting combination which\nin most cases adds to the\nunderlying humour. Watching\nTitania, queen of the fairies,\nsinging 'you must have been a beautiful baby' to Bottom, who by\nthis stage has acquired a donkey's FELIX\nhead, certainly adds to the\natmosphere.\nOf course using music in this\nway does create some difficulties\ntoo. On occasions the stage was\nrather crowded as 'the Fairies'\nretreated to their instruments but\ngenerally the stage direction was\nhandled quite well. Perhaps of\nmore importance was the relative\nweakness of the male vocal leads,\nparticularly during the rather\ncalamitous version of 'good\nvibrations'. This was quickly\nforgotten however, as the play-within-a play brought 'a midsummer night's dream' to a heady\nconclusion.\nThe antics of the mechanical s and their romantic yet tragic 'pro-duct ion' contained the pick of\nplay's comic acting. Matt Williams\nplayed a hyperactive Bottom with\naplomb, John Savery's Snug was\nremarkably straight-faced and Joe\nMcFadden's legs and feminine\ncharms were worth the ticket price\nalone. In particular their manic\nversion of '\"right\" said fred' was a fitting end piece to a well acted\nshambles.\nEqually the overall finale, an\naptly weary 'a hard day's night',\nrounded off a pleasing performance with an impressive\ndemonstration of the thought that\nhad obviously gone into its\ndirection and orchestration. O There are two views about tank girl. There are those die hard comic fans\nwho'll leave the film early with a sour grimace and those who have just\npicked up a more general note of interest and fascination for the\ncharacter. And for those people, the ones who hadn't heard of Tank Girl\nbefore May, this film is entertaining, despite its similarly to a futuristic\nfemale Rambo.\nTank Girl is set in the future when planet earth has become a desert.\nWater has become the most valuable resource. There lives Tank Girl,\nreferred throughout the film as Rebecca Buck. She's a bad smart ass and\nof course the heroine. Due to the deaths of several of her friends in a latter day commune, she is out to get Kesfilee, the head of Water and\nPower Company, played by regular English bad guy Malcom McDowell.\nWhich is about as structured as the plot gets. In a similar way McDowell's character is extremely boring; this type of mega lo manic is as old and\ntiresome as Hollywood's attempts to film graphic novel heroes.\nAnd it's easy to see why comic book fans have found Tank Girl\nunacceptable. Changes have been made to make the film accessible to\nthe general public. Tank Girl's name for starters Apparently this was\nthought up at the last minute by co-creator Jamie Hewlett to satisfy the\nscript writers inability to grasp the concept that Tank Girl is just 'tank girl'.\nAnd then there is Lori Petty's extremely annoying high pitched American\ndrool which just makes people suicidal.\nStill the original comic book heroine is a40 th century Barbarella and\nTank Girl is very much on similar lines. Visually the whole film appears\nfaithful to the artists and the excellent animated sequences breaks the\nfilm up, creating a little of the outrageous Tank Girl atmosphere. And\nfinally there are the mutant kangaroos; surely the best thing in the film.\nSo, Tank Girl is enjoyable and fun to watch but only if you don't expect the real comic to pop out of the film. The artistic license will\ndisagree with some people and it's important to remember that the\ninterpretation of a theme is different for everyone. For those of us who\nknow it well though, this is Tank Girl without her tank. 0\n\n"

    "content": "News\nJohn O 'Leary, the Aeronautics departmental photographer, has been awarded\nan MBE in recognition of his work as a policeman in the 'Specials', writes\nAunindya Sinharay. John was recommended for the honour by the Area\nHead Office of the Special Constabulary and also by his own Peckham\nDivisional Station. Describing himself as \"an operational officer walking the\nstreet\", he told FELIX that it is almost unique for an ordinary officer to\nreceive this type of honour especially since he has served in the force for a comparatively short time - seventeen years. Citing one of his chief tasks as\n'selling the old bill', he has been heavily involved in community projects.\nEvery summer he helps take up to 800 South London youths camping for a month in an character building initiative, as part of the Southwark Youth\nProject. The annual trip costs around \u00a350,000 of which he helps to raise\n\u00a310,000. He is also involved with the Christmas Care Association, working\nfor fifteen hours every Christmas Day to provide food for over 400 elderly\npeople. Currently holding the rank of Special Inspector, John's technician\nalter-ego works in the Aeronautics Department where he has been since\njoining in 1956 as a junior technician. Mr. Ron Adams, Aeronautics\ndepartmental superintendent, told FELIX; \"He's known to me and to\nothers for his all round willingness to help whenever he can ... it couldn't have\nhappened to a nicer person.\"\nLectures Move\nBY ANDREW SMITH AND A UN INDY AS IN HA RAY It has now been confirmed that,\nstarting next term, chemists will\nhave the majority of their\nlectures in the Sherfield\nBuilding. The move has been\nforced by preparations for the\nconstruction of the Basic Medical\nScience (BMS) building.\nProfessor Alan Swanson,\nPro-Rector for Educational\nQuality, said the 'displaced'\ndepartments had 'all been very\nhelpful'. The Chemistry department has been offered exclusive\nuse of the 120-seat Pippard\nLecture theatre, the larger of the\nSherfield Building's two lecture\ntheatres. Biochemists will use the\nRead Theatre and Huxley 140.\nNo extra time provision is\nbeing made for students to travel\nfrom labs and lectures to\nSherfield. Professor Swanson\nsaid that the students and staff\nwould have to become more\ndisciplined to ensure that\nlectures start punctually.\nAware of the wider benefits\nthat the BMS development will\nbring to Imperial College,\nProfessor David Phillips, Head of\nthe Chemistry Department,\nseemed at ease with the required\nmoves. He said that \"it's inevitable that old buildings will\nhave to be sacrificed.\" His department will be losing three\nlecture theatres and a large\ntutorial room.\nProf Phillips told FELIX that he hoped chemistry courses\nwould not experience too much\ntimetabling disruption. His Department has previously run\nthe majority of lectures in the\nmornings, with laboratory\nsessions in the afternoon.\nStressing the importance of\nlaboratory work in chemistry\ncourses, he said, \"Imperial\nchemistry graduates are characterised by the amount of practical\nwork they do ... it's why industry\nbeats a path to our door.\"\nAsked whether he was happy\nwith next term's arrangement, he\nadmitted: \"it's the only com-promise. Alan Swanson's been\nvery accommodating.\" Professor\nPhillips believes that construction work on the BMS project will begin on schedule\nand that vibration-damping\nequipment may be required for\nsome of the department's experimental equipment.\nLiberal Agenda for IC Cash\nBY ANDREW SMITH A new draft document setting out\nthe Liberal Democrat view of the\nfuture of further and higher\neducation could be disastrous for\nImperial College if ever implemented. Their plans centre on a more equitable sharing of the\n\u00a3600 million that the Higher Education Funding Council of\nEngland ( HE FCE) gives to\nuniversities to spend on research.\nThe present system sees IC\nreceiving relatively large\namounts, since HE FCE targets\n'centres of excellence'. The Liberal Democrat document says\nthat 'centres of excellence' do not\nexist: a point strongly denied by\nImperial College authorities.\nThey suggest that the document\naddresses a problem which does\nnot exist, and question whether\nthe Lib Dems have actually\nconsulted any universities other\nthan ex-polytechnics.\nThe Lib Dems propose\ncutting the proportion of the\n\u00a3600m research money that is\ncurrently given to institutions\nlike IC. This would help spread\n\u00a3200 million across the whole\nsystem 'to enable all academic\nstaff to engage in research or\ndevelopment work'.\nThis idea goes fundamentally against IC's argument\nthat scarce research money must\nbe concentrated. One senior\ncollege official questioned the\nbenefit of giving money to people\nwho are 'not any good at research\nand who probably never will be'.\nThe other main plank of the\ndraft policy is the modularis ation of all higher education courses.\nThus students could obtain\nqualifications - using way stage marks rather than degrees - after\nstudying from a wide variety of\nsubjects. Again, this is fundamentally contrary to college\npolicy, recently outlined by the\nRector. He emphasised that IC\nmust defend the benefits of full\ntime residential degree courses.\nWhilst questioning the\nexperience that the Liberal Democrat planners have of\nhigher education, College authorities expressed the hope that\nthey might invite them to college\nto 'show them what really\nhappens'. In this way, they say,\npoliticians could be convinced\nthat funds must be focused on\nhigh quality research centres.\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nAssistant Printer Jeremy Thomson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Wei Lee\nEditorial Team\nArt & Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nLayout & Design Paul Dias and\nJon Jordan\nMusic Vik Bansal\nNews Rachel Walters.\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nS Files Rebecca Mileham\nSummer Guide Jeremy Thomson\nStandby Jon Jordan\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week Jeremy Thomson\nand Rachel Walters\nFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nWho's watching your back?\nSecurity issues were the basis for a large number of this year's news stories: from\ndrug dealing to computer thieving, Imperial College is increasingly home to\ncrime worries. With the help of local PC Clive Coleman and IC Head of\nSecurity Keith Reynolds, Andrew Dorman-Smith looks at the conflict\nbetween tightening up protection and clamping down on student freedom. Swipe Cards\nSecurity meets the\ntechnology of the nineties\nThe swipe card - or 'Access\nControl' - system was initiated in\n1 992 in an attempt to 'control the\nperimeter' of IC so that security\nstaff would be released to 'super-vise the interior'. Instead of the\n88-strong team responsible for\nmanning the front doors of every\nbuilding, only four lodges are now\npermanently supervised, with the\nrest of the staff expected to patrol\ncertain 'sectors'.\nBut security personnel admit\nthat the system isn't infallible. They\n0\n\u2022 ,:.y m?:m: y:yyy yyyy yyyy yy \u201e\u2022:;;,\u2022:'. :MM:-kM^.:MMMMM\nKeith Reynolds\nIC Head of Security\nMr Reynolds was instrumental in\nbringing through the 1992 reforms\nand he says that the security service\nhas come on by 'leaps and bounds'.\nFuture security plans and\nequipment upgrades will be\nbalanced against the college's budgetary constraints. The head of\nsecurity said: \"we can't go round\nblithely robbing academic depart-ment s\". Putting the present crime\nrate in to perspective, Mr Reynolds\nasserts that, \"compared to other\nLondon Colleges, we're laughing...\nwe're sitting on it pretty well\".\nHe appealed for student help\nin tackling crime: \"please come and\ntell us ... we're not here to make your\nlife difficult, we're here to help.\"\nFELIX see 'piggy-backing' - the way in\nwhich people without swipe cards\ncan simply follow authorised\nstudents into buildings - as a major problem. With few students\nprepared to actually ask others for\nidentification the whole idea of\n'controlling the perimeter' is being\nput in doubt. Clive Coleman\nsuggests that students and staff\nare perfectly entitled to ask those\nfollowing them in or out for proof\nof identification, saying that the\npolice will deal severely with\nanyone who objects to being\nquestioned.\nKeith Reynolds insists that\nthe system is perfectly adequate: a foolproof system of floor to ceiling\nturnstiles would cost \u00a3 1 . 3 million.\nTo support his view that 'piggy-backing' isn'ta problem, Mr\nReynolds asserts that the vast\nmajority of robberies which occur\nduring the swipe card system's activation are as a result of forced\nentry.\nSafety\n'Halls are a priority'\nHalls of Residence are particularly susceptible to 'piggy-back'\nentering, but when the original\nreforms were introduced Mr Reynolds promised: \" My priority\nis the students, especially those\nliving in halls\". Some security\nguards are known to favour\ntwenty four hour manned security\nlodges at the front door of each\nhall, especially the large Southside ones. Citing the attack on a female fresher in her Linstead\nbedroom two years ago, they\ninsist that the protection of\nstudents would be improved with\na heightened security presence.\nPC Coleman agrees with\nthis sentiment, suggesting that\nthe cost could be limited by\nemploying students between 6pm and midnight, for example, to\ncheck IDs.\nWhile Mr Reynolds insists\nthat the overall 'crime and\nincident rate' in halls is not that\nbad, he asserts that under the\npresent staffing levels it is not\npossible for security guards to be\nposted at each door.\nHe is though attracted by\nPC Coleman's suggestion of\nhaving students on each door,\nsaying that it as 'a good idea'. But\nhe questioned where the money\nfor this could be found.\nClive Coleman\nThe Local Bobby\nPC Coleman, the home beat officer\nof the Belgravia sector, spends a large proportion of his time dealing\nwith Imperial affairs. In fact, it has\nbeen reported that two thirds of\ncrime in the area happens at\nImperial. Clive runs crime prevention weeks at IC twice each year\nto raise awareness of the security\nproblem, where he marks students\nbicycles with a security code to act as\na theft deterrent.\n\n"

The\ndamage caused was estimated at\n\u00a32000.\nGhassan Kari an, KCL SU President, hastily distanced\nhimself from the affair, calling\nmascot ry 'toss', despite the fact\nhe'd shown interest in it earlier\nin the year. He claimed that the\nincident was 'Imperial's fault'\nafter the initial attack by the RCS\nstudents. He denied any involvement of KCL SU, any prior\nknowledge of the attack and any\nuse of the KCL SU minibus. The\npossibility of pressing charges\nexisted as the offenders had been\ncaught on security cameras.\nThere was an added\ndimension - some felt that\nPresident and Labour councillor\nKarian was merely protecting his\nown interests lest his image be\ndamaged in his campaign for the\nUL U presidency. But a week\nlater he issued a full confession,\nsaying that he'd knowingly misled ICU and FELIX. He'd known about the use of the\nKCL SU minibus in the attack,\nthat the offenders had targeted\nIC, and he even confirmed that\nhe'd handed over the keys\nhimself. He apologised for the\n\"collective decision to cover the\nfact that our minibus was used\".\nYet he denied lying\npersonally to FELIX about the\nincident, stressing the 'collective\ndecision'. Asked whether or not\nthe affair could affect his\ncampaign to become UL U the reporter present.\npresident, he replied \" Why should it?\" Elected to the UL U Presidency in early March, he\ntold UL U General Council that\nhe would occasionally tell 'fibs'.\nThe previously media\nfriendly Karian refused to talk to\nAND FINALLY... Of course this is but an\nimpressionistic view of the\nImperial's news year - lots of\nbroad strokes with plenty of local\ncolour. But what lies beyond the\nedge of our limited canvas?\nOne potentially worrisome\nissue for ICU is the fact that\ncome 1998 it could be relocated\ninto the Sherfield Building. But\nthe provisional plans provided by\nthe Estates division were found\nwanting by ICU; the proposed\n3rd floor Union Bar would be\nvery small, and it seemed\nunlikely that the Traditional Bar\ncould be transferred to the new\npremises 'panel by panel' as\noriginally hoped. There'd also be\nthe problem of whether ICU catering would be able to\ncompete with that of College.\nAccording to Dan Look, a referendum on the proposed\nmove was \"not something we\nwould rule out.\"\nCrime proved a major problem throughout the year, starting\nwith signs and doormats going\nmissing from ICU in October,\nvending machines and car radios\nvanishing and arcade machines\nbeing raided in Halls. Some\noffenders proved less adept than\nothers - a two-man crime wave ground to a halt after it got lost\nin the Electrical Engineering\nDepartment.\nThe Overseas Societies\nCommittee finally managed to\nassemble a committee with which\nto begin the year, though the\nrun-up to International Night\nwas dogged with all manner of\nproblems, plagued with infighting and JapanSoc boycotting the\nevent in protest of the handling\nof the event by Andreas Mershin,\nOSC Chair. The March event\nactually turned out to be a sellout success with\nMershin saying\nthat he \"didn't expect it to go so\nwell.\" By the end\nof the term\ndifferences had\nbeen resolved.\nAnother fight, another\nvenue: The\nQueen's Lawn played host to a~^ brawl between\nstaff and\ntechnicians after a dispute in the\nHolland Club just before Christmas. There have been several\ncalls for more responsible consumption of alcohol this year,\nparticularly in the wake of the\nBeit fights, where a security\nguard was attacked in January.\nAs if the NUS and Sabbatical\nelections were certainly enough,\nothers took place around college\nand received varying degrees of\ndisinterest. The C&G elections\ncame and went with a depressingly low number of people\nnoticing and even fewer caring.\nThe RCS and RS M elections\noccurred with a slightly larger\nturnout, but all three led to much\ndebate on the future of the CCUs\nat South Kensington.\nFourth year Aero exam\npapers went missing, allowing\nthe students to put their feet up\nfor a while as their exams got\npostponed. The examinations did\neventually take place, but if the\nsummer exam papers had gone\nmissing the ensuing chaos would\nhave been horrific. \"I don't know\nwhat you'd do then, jump out of\nthe window or something,\" commented the Head of Aeronautics,\nProfessor P.W. Bearman. With\nthe summer term free of flattened\nAeronautical professors adorning\nthe pavements, we can only\nsurmise that things have run\nsmoothly in exam-land. 13\nThanks to everyone in college, bot\nstaff and students, 'great and s mal without whose generous co-opera ti and time the news pages would ha v been barren. We are grateful.\nThe FELIXnews team wishes\nall their regular readers an enjoy ab summer, and their detractors an\nincident-packed newsworthy fate,\nstarting next October.\n2\n1Jung s FELIX MM\n\n"
