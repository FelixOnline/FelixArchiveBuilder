    "content": "Saturday the 20th dawned earlier\nfor some as eight Imperial debaters\nmade their way to UCL for 9am for\nthe UCL IV 2007, a debating competition featuring 34 teams from\naround London and beyond. For\nseveral of the debaters (including\nme) this was to be their first competition and as the hundreds of\npeople filed into one of the lecture\ntheatres in UCL\n\u2019s medical depart-ment, the cruciform building, they\nknew little or nothing about what\nwould happen.\nIt soon emerged that each team\nwould debate four times before the\nfinal, for which the best four teams\nwould be selected. Slowly the first\nmotion to be debated appeared on\nthe projector and we would be debating whether teachers should be\ngiven a statutory stop and search\npower on school grounds. It was\nthen it all started to go horribly\nwrong as we discovered that 80%\nof the debaters there were law students or trainee barristers.\nNevertheless, the four Imperial\nteams held their own throughout\nthe first round even though the lawyers brought up the human rights\nact every few minutes as though\nthey had written the damn thing.\nThe second round came upon us\nlike a lion upon a small wounded\ndeer; we debated whether the parents / guardians / those with right\nof attourney should be able to cast a\nproxy vote on the behalf of the mentally ill. It was an interesting round\nalthough it didn\u2019t take us long to\nfind the general theme that had\nbeen snuck into the competition\n\u2013 the law. Gone were our hopes of\na debate on stem cells, the speed of\nlight, genetic engineering or even\nPro Evolution Soccer 7.\nLunch was a welcome break and\nso off we went to McDonalds to\nget some quality food to refuel our\nminds for the second half of the day.\nOur fears were confirmed as the\nthird round was announced, and we\nspoke about whether defendants\nshould have the right to elect trial\nby judge alone without a jury.\nThis is something that I\u2019m sure\nwe knew little or nothing about compared to a lawyer but we cleverly invented utter bollocks to fill the time\nduring our speeches, which at the\ntime made sense, but then again\nmost of the judges were lawyers too.\nNo escape. The final round dawned\nand up came the motion, which\nstruck like the Leviathan upon the\nsinking ship of whatever hope we\nhad left. Yes believe it or not we had\nto develop convincing arguments\nabout whether MI6 should have its\nremit widened to encompass retaliatory corporate espionage. The motion was no doubt interesting\u2026 I\u2019ll\njust leave it at that.\nUCL were kind enough to put on\na massive feast for the debaters afterwards and it was all well worth\nthe \u00a310 we each put forward for\nthe competition. We even stayed to\nwatch the final to see some spectacular debaters at work, it felt\nbetter to see them in the final and\nknow that we had faced them only\nhours before. It is this kind of com-petition, where debaters from all\nover the country get to debate with\neach other regardless of ability that\nmakes it more exciting.\nIt is certainly true that we learnt\na lot from our day at UCL and if we\nthought some of the motions were\na bit weird, well I guess we learnt\nmore from speaking about them.\nThanks must go to the debaters\nwho made the epic journey, Shilpa\nKodati, Simon Lumley, Yazan\nBilleh, Anthony Maina, Jamillah\nDavid, Kewen Chen, Aneurin Young\nand Alex Kendall. Thanks also Ed\nfor organising our entry into the\ncompetition.\nDebate society meets every\nWednesday at 6pm in SAF near\nroom 120. People are welcome to\njoin up! Competitions are always\ngreat fun and really improve speaking skills.\nNovice debaters enjoying the competition and the food, yes, I\u2019m looking at you on the right, at UCL\n23\nfelix\nFriday 2 February 2007\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDebaters travel all the way to UCL\nAlex Kendall\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington\nLondon SW7 3ES\n(1 Minute walk from\nSouth Kensington Tube)\nTe l e p h o n e 0 2 0 7 8 2 3 8 9 6 8\nw w w . f r e s h h a i r d r e s s e r s . c o . u k\nCASH ONLY\n\u2018Still the best student offer in\nSouth Kensington!\u2019\nONLY BY EXPERIENCED STYLISTS\n\u00a326 .....

Answers on a postcard,\nplease.\nAnyway, the reason I\u2019m tired\nisn\u2019t because I\u2019ve been working on Felix all weekend (As you\nknow, this student journalism lark\njust writes itself) or, you know, doing work.\nHah. It\u2019s because I\u2019m playing\nBattlefield 2142 and have been\nfor... well, a while. I can\u2019t even\nremember whether I enjoy the\ngame any more, I\u2019ve just slipped\ninto this strange, t\u2019ai-ch\u2019i-like cycle of taking potshots and having\nmy arse handed to me by sugar-rushing twelve year-olds.\nWhich is alright. I guess I\u2019m\nstill playing after a death rate\nof slightly more than one per\nminute simply because I love the\ngame. I love the way it plays, the\nway it sounds, the way it looks in\nthe morning when we wake up\ntogether. I can\u2019t really give a good\nreason for it.\nThis issue is a bit fanboy/fan-girlish. It\u2019s about loving something so much it hurts a little. It\u2019s\nabout the kind of geek that even\nother geeks are unsure about.\nWe play Metroid until it stops\nmaking sense, mourn the loss of\na war hero, and see what happens when the credits stop rolling\nin Final Fantasy VII (by making it\nup ourselves, with added sex).\nIt feels a little wrong to aspire to\na stereotype like that. But it gives\na kick, in a kind of sadomasochis-tic way. We don\u2019t do it because we\ncan\u2019t help it. We do it because we\nget something out of it. Most of\nus end up at Imperial because,\nonce upon a time, we worked like\ngeeks.\nAs a last note, don\u2019t forget that\nthe CGC are holding their next\nLAN event on Saturday 3rd February, with more DotA and CS 1.6\nplanned. It\u2019s taking place in the\nEE Building, room 509, on the\n5th floor. If you can\u2019t make it in\nthe building (you\u2019ll need to swipe\nin), you can call the society on the\nday on 07929 022493.\nBack in 2142, I question the\nparentage of \u201cnoob_killa\u201d and\nenquire as to the wellbeing of his\nmother.

I love\nthis game.\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\n10 felix Friday 2 February 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week in videogaming\nT\nhe statistic that struck\nus this week wasn\u2019t, as\nthe Japanese flag below suggests, the gulf\nbetween Microsoft and\nthe Far East. Instead, it was news\nthat in India, there are an estimate\n1.6million XBox 360 gamers. And\ndespite this, console companies\nand developers the world over continue to fight against the tide of the\nJapanese market. This week, seven\nthousand people bought 360s in\nJapan. More than a hundred and\ntwenty thousand people bought DS\nLites.\nWith India and China\u2019s continued\ngrowth in the world, it\u2019s likely that\nthe Eastern markets may become\nwider, as well as Russia\u2019s continued interest in games. The real\nproblem, however, remains one of\npiracy. At the time of going to press,\nMicrosoft had recently issued financial losses of $268mn and reduced\nforecasts for the coming year by 3\nmillion units. Though the company\nblames repair and warranty issues,\nit\u2019s likely that underachievement in\nthe East contributed to this.\nSpeaking about holding what\nthey\u2019ve got (I\u2019m not really sure\nwhat I meant there), the internet\nhas opened its doors to the voting stage of Miss Videogame 2006.\nThe aim, according to the site, is\n\u201cto make the gaming industry take\nwomen gamers seriously and treat\nthem with respect.\u201d\nWhich is charming.\nThe only problem is that current-ly, female protagonists in games\nare resourceful (Beyond Good And\nEvil), strong (Tomb Raider) and\ngenerally taken quite seriously\n(Metroid). By contrast, most of the\ncontestants at the contest seem, for\nwant of a better word, a bit slutty.\nAlright not slutty.\nBut seriously, we\u2019re unsure how\nAktrez\u2019 incredibly smooth upper\nthigh enables her to play Gears of\nWar any better. If you\u2019d like to vote,\nthe website is taking votes until\nApril at www.missvideogame.com.\nNo more smut here though.\nHighbrow news now \u2013 the Postal\nmovie will feature faeces and Osama Bin Laden.

The agreement is a\nculmination of efforts by volunteer\nresearch representatives and the\nsabbs.\nThe short-changing was brought\nto the attention of postgraduate\nrepresentatives in the Mathematics Department. The department\nhas being paying their students\n\u00a312,300 per annum, compared to\nthe \u00a314,300 recommended by the\nESPRC, leaving maths PhDs \u00a32000\nout of pocket.\nThe short-changing is not confined solely to the Maths Department, as a dossier prepared by\nresearch representatives Daniel\nSauder (RCSU) and Eirini Spentza\n(CGCU) shows.\nIt reveals that almost all departments have been short-changing\ntheir PhD students, though not all\nto the same extent as the Maths\nDepartment. Computing, for exam-ple, pays an amount between the\nESPRC amount and the Maths Department amount.\nThe dossier was presented to the\nStrategic Education Committee,\na College meeting that students\nare not normally invited to attend,\nby Ben Harris (Deputy President,\nEducation & Welfare). The presentation was initially to be given\nby Shama Rahman (Deputy President, Graduate Students), but snow\nhad delayed her tube journey and\nshe arrived around 20 minutes late\nfor the meeting.\nThe SEC sets high-level College\npolicy on educational matters, and\ninitial talks between Deputy Rector Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz indicated that the Committee\nwere in favour of awarding the full\namount.\nThe Committee approved the\nrecommendation, and the College\nManagement Body approved the\nmeasure last Friday. This means\nthat departments will now be forced\nto pay the full amount, regardless of\nthe funding source of the PhD stu-dent. This will apply to both new\nand current students, but unfortunately will not be backdated.\n2 felix Friday 2 February 2007\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nVolunteer postgrad reps\u2019 dossier convinces the College to pay\nPhD students in all departments their London weighting\nThe Union has issued a somewhat\ntriumphant press release on the\nUnion website (www.imperialcol-legeunion.org) that emphasises the\nrole of the sabbatical officers in this\nachievement; however, credit must\nalso be given to the two volunteer\nrepresentatives that gave up their\ntime to produce the dossier.\nThis is a rare clear victory for\nthe Union in its dealings with the\nCollege, with the combination of\nstudent reps and sabbs working together to produce a quick and comprehensive solution.\nNo confidence in\nsabb to go ahead\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\nThe Union Court has issued its \u2018determination\u2019 on the no confidence\nmotion submitted against Shama\nRahman, Deputy President (Grad-uate Students). The motion has\nbeen deemed to be constitutional,\nand is to be voted on at an emergency session of Council this coming Monday.\nThe Court, famous already for its\nlengthy meetings, took four hours\nto debate the motion. A number of\npoints were discussed, from the\nlegality of some of the evidence to\ncomplaints about prejudicial reporting by Live! and Felix. Both\npublications escaped any censor-ship, and their respective editors\n\u201chad so far acted responsibly\u201d in\nthe eyes of the Court.\nThe vast majority of the twelve-page determination considers the\nstatus of Ms Rahman (once again\nreferredto,amusingly,as\u201cSabbD\u201d).\nShe, like the other sabbs, signed a\nemployment contract at the start\nof her term of office, and the Court\nhas decided that this makes her an\nemployee of the Union.\nThis raised questions as to whether Ms Rahman could make a case\nfor constructive or unfair dismissal,\nshould she be no confidenced by\nCouncil. Under the Employment\nRights Act 1996, she does not have\nthe right to sue for unfair dismissal,\nas this right applies only to people\nwho have been employed for more\nthan a year.\nThe Court had also discussed\n\u2018guidelines\u2019 for the media at a previous meeting, which John Collins\n(Union President) said would allow\nhim to \u201ccensor\u201d reporting by Live!\nand Felix on the no confidence\nmotion.\nThe Live! editor, Ashley Brown,\naccepted that it may be necessary\nto have guidelines for the press,\nbut that they should only be guidelines and therefore not actively\nenforced.\nThese would then only be considered in the light of a complaint,\nrather than immediately censoring\nthe publication in question. The Felix Editor, Andy Sykes, was strongly\nopposed to any such guidelines, arguing that as the Court had found\nthe editors to be acting in good faith\nso far, and that they should be trusted to do their jobs properly.\nJohn Collins defended the need\nfor guidelines, saying that as a trustee of the Union he could be personally liable for anything Felix or Live!\npublished that could be considered\ndefamatory.\nHe also stated that he had no\nproblem with the Felix Editor being\nsued for anything Felix printed, but\nthat he would not be willing to defend Felix or its editor in court, if it\ncame to that.\nAfter a somewhat protracted and\ncircular discussion, the Court eventually decided that no guidelines\nwere necessary, and that the printing of anything which may carry\nlegal implications is left up to the\njudgement of the editors.\nThe Court also discussed the\nfront page of Felix, in which allegations from a leaked draft copy of\nthe no confidence motion were re-ported, in terms of whether it would\nprejudice the eventual decision of\nCouncil. The Court decided that no\nremark made in the article would\nso prejudice a Council member that\nthey would not be able to put it out\nof mind during the hearing of the\nmotion.\nA number of procedural measures were discussed; neither Jon\nMatthews (the proposer) or Ms\nRahman will be able to vote, proxy\nvotes will be disallowed (as this\nmeans the donator of the vote will\nnot give a fair hearing), and the\nsomewhat controversial email evidence retrieved by Mr Matthews\nfrom Ms Rahman\u2019s email account\nwill be admissable. Seconders of\nthe motion will be allowed to vote,\nas it was felt that removing one-fifth\nof Council would make the hearing\nundemocratic.\nT.

    "content": "11\nfelix\nFriday 2 February 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\n\u2019m a firm believer that adding the word \u2018internet\u2019 to the\nbeginning of a phrase makes\nthe concept infinitely scarier.\nThink about it \u2013 shopping is\na pleasant experience to be taken\nweekly with friends and money.\nInternet shopping is hunting down\nlost copies of the Mortal Kombat\nmovie at 3am and accidentally ordering four copies on your debit\ncard.\nCommunity, then. Community is\nthat word that people use to blackmail us into picking up litter. But an\nInternet community is generally a\nterrible, twisted, Geiger-esque mu-tation, with spikes and Americans\npoking out in all the wrong places.\nDeviantART is one such internet\ncommunity. And if you surf onto its\nhomepage, you\u2019d probably think it\nwas a regular enough site \u2013 clean\nlines, soothing colours, and a collection of digital art, photography\nand painting to a very high quality.\nThere\u2019s a sense of sharing, of creative development, of normality. It\u2019s\nlike walking into an arts college.\nBut something much more hardcore is lurking just below the sur-face, because deviantART plays\nhost to one of the internet\u2019s most\nprolific fanart and fanfiction com-munities. And a little digging\naround unearths some pretty interesting things.\nFan work\u2019s not our field here at\nFelix Games, but you won\u2019t need to\ngo far into any internet community\nto find those who take their love of\ngames one step further. Some write\nfiction that continues where one\nstory left off, some take their games\nto paper and create pictures, por-traits, comics, what-ifs \u2013 it\u2019s all\nabout using your other skills and\nbringing gaming into them.\nLydia Hartley is better known as\nDa-Phase-Meister on deviantART,\nand even better known for her\nstrong fanart work on all manner of\ngaming, film and anime topics.\n\u201cMy first games console was a\nSNES which a student left us. That\nPutting the \u2018fan\u2019 in \u2018fanaticism\u2019\nHardcore gaming isn\u2019t always about a high score. Michael Cook discovers the other side of dedication\nwas back in 1996 or so \u2013 my old\nhouse was a guest house. Having\nstudents around was so cool, and\nthey\u2019d often bring us random gifts.\n\u201cOnce I got my Gameboy Color,\nmy new found love was Pokemon.\nI began drawing much more due to\nmy love for Pokemon \u2013 it was inspir-ing. I\u2019ve been gaming and drawing\never since.\u201d\nLydia\u2019s artwork on deviantART\nisn\u2019t exclusively fanart \u2013 she has\nan account dedicated to original\nworks, and studies art here in the\nUK. But fanart is still something\nshe feels worth doing.\n\u201cI find drawing fanart quite inspir-ing. I love the idea of being able to\ntake an existing character and being able to experiment with different poses and scenarios for them.\u201d\nType a game\u2019s name into the\nsearch bar at deviantART, and\nyou\u2019ll get a pretty good idea at how\n\u2018experimentation\u2019 works in some\nfanart circles. The pencilled sketch\nof Cloud, below, is a fairly normal\npiece of fanart. The legions of semi-(and not so semi-) naked Tifa pictures aren\u2019t quite as canon.\nFor some companies, fanart is\na contentious issue. deviantART\nsupports a Prints program to allow\nartists to sell their work online, but\nto submit an image as a print, their\nTerms and Conditions state that,\n\u201cYou may only submit Artwork if\nyou ... hold all intellectual property\nrights in the Artwork.\u201d Legal clashes in the past have made this a key\ninclusion.\nBut some games companies see\nit as a healthy expression of gaming love. Blizzard\u2019s website plays\nhost to a gallery, now fourty pages\nstrong, of submitted fanart that\u2019s\nmost impressed them. The gallery\n\u2013 which you can find online at www.\nblizzard.com/inblizz/fanart/ \u2013 contains some incredibly detailed and\nwell-created drawings of characters which, in most cases, weren\u2019t\nso detailed in their original games.\nPerhaps the reason fan work has\nsuch a strange reputation, then, is\nbecause of the weirder, obscurely\nsexual side to some of it. Games\naren\u2019t exactly the most sexed up\nmedia on the market, but a flick\nthrough the reams of fanfiction\navailable on sites such as FanFiction.net \u2013 and we do mean reams,\nthere are over sixteen thousand\nentries for Final Fantasy VII alone\n\u2013 will turn up as many bizarre love\npairings as it does normal stories.\n\u201cI love twisting characters \u2013 making [them] do something slightly\nout of the ordinary. And it\u2019s great\npractice for anatomy and such.\u201d\nLydia explains. \u201cThere\u2019s always\na limit. I mean, I have quite high\nlimits \u2013 I draw characters being\nseductive and weird \u2013 but the limit\nis probably when you reach a point\nwhere the game or fandom dominates your life.\u201d\nLydia says that she thinks games\nprovide a special kind of source ma-terial. \u201cVideo games are more interactive \u2013 they come from a more\ninteractive world. People can \u2018relate\u2019 more to them.\u201d\nAnd certainly, there was a lot of\nrelating going on in much of the\nfanart we uncovered. But it\u2019s mostly\ntasteful, and there\u2019s a real sense of\ncommunity and creation going on,\nso the smuttier stereotypes tends\nto get shaken off quickly.\nIt\u2019s a huge, often unexplored,\nsection of the gaming culture. Fandom is one of the most fascinating\nthings on the web, being something\nlike watching unicorns having sex.\nUnusual, a little disturbing, but undeniably interesting. And, let\u2019s face\nit, a little arousing.\nHmm.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why I drew this.\u201d Lydia explains. We\u2019re not entirely either. The most interesting fanart, however, tends to be the most unusual\nThis sketch piece from Final Fantasy VII is by Antti Jussila whose work includes Silent Hill and Devil May Cry. http://amrrr.deviantart.com\nLydia\u2019s work can be found online at\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ynrzsf and http://\ntinyurl.com/2fjzga\n\n"

    "content": "Dreaming of Oscar success\nWith 8 nominations, Hollywood seems to like Dreamgirls, but is it up to the hype?\nDespite generally having an open\nmind, when the title of this film\nfirst reached my ears a couple of\nmonths back, my heart sank. It conjures up two very different images\nof either kids\u2019 TV or a late-night\nshow for which you need the Sky\nPIN. It didn\u2019t help to hear that Beyonce would be the lead, and some\nAmerican Idol act would make up\nthe support; especially when it\nturned out they\u2019d be playing,\nshock, singers. But don\u2019t let\nit be said that Dreamgirls\nhas no surprises up its\nsleeve.\nThe story of a three-piece girl group trying to make\nit big as Motown explodes out of\nDetroit seems fun enough, and\nwhile this is the quest you\u2019ll see for\nthe whole film, something strange\nhappens about halfway through.\nAt this point it seems as though\nthe producers just threw the plans\nup in the air when someone whispered \u201cOscars\u201d and the whole thing\nchanges direction. The distribution\ncompany launched a massive Oscar\ncampaign so, given its recent snub\nin the Best Picture category, is\nthere something letting Dreamgirls down?\nIf you like musicals, this\ncould be the film of the year\nfor you. Without more than\none minute between numbers much of the time,\nthis show has so\nmany songs packed\ninto its lengthy\nrunning time that\nyou come out feeling exhausted by\nthe pace. The dec-Happyness, Happyness, the greatest gift that I possess\nChris Gardner (Will Smith) is on the\nverge of hitting rock-bottom; he\u2019s\noverdue on taxes, he\u2019s late on rent,\nhis wife (Thandie Newton) seems\npretty nasty, and his son (Jaden\nSmith) attends a day care in Chinatown that spells happiness with a y.\nHis only way out is the slim chance\nof a job after an unpaid competitive\ninternship at a prestigious firm of\nstockbrokers. When his wife leaves\nand he\u2019s left without a home, Gardner must face homeless shelters,\npublic bathrooms and an unhappy 5\nyear-old son whilst desperately trying to excel in the office.\nOn the surface, the movie is a\nclassic \u2018rags to riches\u2019 heart-warm-ing tale of human willpower and\nstrength. Underneath, it is Hollywood\u2019s \u2018Pursuit of an Oscar\u2019. While\nbased on a true story, a certain\namount of guilt comes with mocking its sympathy-seeking portrayal;\nnow a successful stockbroker with\nbest selling novel, Gardner and his\nson really did spend the night in a\nsubway toilet and he did queue for\nhours to get a bed in a homeless\nshelter all the while working on the\noff-chance he might get a better job.\nA sucker for tear-jerkers like me\ncan ignore the obvious milking of a\ntrue inspirational story \u2013 I was rooting for him the entire time. Others\nmight roll their eyes when Gardner\u2019s only source of light to work by\nflickers out after just sitting down\nunder it. It\u2019s a shame. The truth behind it all is the recipe for a classically moving and successful movie.\nInstead we get a great storyline\nwith excessively \u2018Hollywoodized\u2019\nscenes, mediocre dialogue and\ncompletely unnecessary voiceover.\nIt irritated me; the attempts at profound statements were pointless\nwhen the content speaks for itself.\nA saving grace, however, is Will\nSmith. After his latest few movies,\nwhich required very little acting tal-ent, we are reminded of his Ali days.\nAll is forgiven when watching his\nincredibly impressive ability to express the strongest emotions with\nvery little effort. Where many actors\nwould throw their arms around and\nFLAM\nIn the inevitable film-release lull\nthat occurs in the post-nomina-tion, pre-Oscar period, we are\nfortunate this year to have several films around to keep us going\nthrough the lean times. Look out\nfor Notes on a Scandal, an im-pressive-looking drama starring\nDame Judy and Cate Blanchett,\nas well as Dreamgirls (reviewed\nthis week).\nNext week we will have a competition to win a Valentine\u2019s\n(retch) weekend away with secondary prizes of DVDs such as\nAnchorman, Old School, and Napoleon Dynamite.\nAlso, congratulations to Jon\nMatthews and Druv Nagpal, the\nwinners of our Breaking & Entering competition a few weeks\nago.\nSadly, so far no-one has taken\nup my generous offer to publish\nreviews of older films or passion\npieces on actors/directors. I can\nonly assume that this lack of response is because you people\nsuck. Prove me wrong, people.\nI\u2019m sure you all have favourite\nfilms, or films that everyone else\nloves but you hate and wish to see\nnailed to the tree of shame and\npublically urinated upon. As al-ways, feel free to tell me the above\nactor/character combination, and\nin which film he appears. film.fe-lix@imperial.ac.uk\nI can see right up your nose\nshout, somewhat surprisingly Will\nSmith can create the same effect\nwith one single tear. Regardless of\nthe fact that he\u2019s obviously begging\nfor a Golden Statue, he deserves it\n\u2013 let\u2019s hope the Academy agrees.\nOn the other hand, a major disappointment was the first appearance\nade it covers sees Motown arrive,\nR\u2018n\u2019B take off, and the new sound\nof the disco explosion herald the\nbeginning of the 70s. However, with\nsuch tight packaging, each song\nblends into the others and it\u2019s hard\nto remember many that stand out.\nTo make it more confusing, the dialogue is sung in lots of places, totally unnecessarily. It has three Oscar\nnominations\nfor\nBest Original Song: Even the Academy couldn\u2019t remember which was\nwhich obviously.\nWhat has drawn attention to the\nfilm, however, is the acting it show-cases. With so many songs it\u2019s hard\nto judge the cast as actors rather\nthan performers a lot of the time,\nbut each shows talent on both sides.\nIs Beyonce any good then? A Golden Globe nomination says yes,\nbut she doesn\u2019t\nreally do\nmuch for the first half, and you\u2019re\nalways aware you are watching\nBeyonce and not Deena Jones.\nHow about Eddie Murphy? Controversially, I\u2019m going to say nothing\nsurprising came here and his was\nnot the performance I\u2019ll remember.\nHe is good, oh yes, but there is one\nwoman who will bring the house\ndown for every performance\u2026\nJennifer Hudson shows that the\nbest UK reality TV show hope, Leona Lewis, has a long way to go to\nmatch the American contingent. A\nrunner-up on American Idol, this\nwoman steals the film from under\nBeyonce\u2019s nose (and rumour has\nit y\u2019all ain\u2019t happy \u2018bout it) with a\nperformance that channels \u201call\nthe greats, Aretha, Whitney, Billie\nHoliday\u201d as Hudson claims her in-spirations. The powerhouse \u201cAnd I\nAm Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d is\nthe one stand-out number because\nof her delivery, and it rescues the\nfilm from a horrible moment of\ncheese immediately preceding\nit. This is Hudson\u2019s film and\nshe \u2018supports\u2019 no-one, despite\nher strong standings in the\nawards season.\nDreamgirls is a fun journey\n(for the most part) but by no means\na stunning critique on celebrity.\nFun is what the audience will look\nfor here, and for the most part it will\ndeliver along with the melodrama\nthat envelopes the second half. Bill\nCondon, the director, says that in\nbringing this Broadway musical to\nthe big screen he was able to convey the social problems in the US\nat the time, whether racism or\ncivil unrest in Detroit. However,\nthis is not what the songs are\nabout. Music is the foundation\non which Dreamgirls is based,\nand for those who enjoy\nmusicals, this won\u2019t leave\nyou disappointed. Just\nexhausted.\nAlex Casey\nDreamgirls\nDirector: Bill Condon\nWriter: Tom Eyen\nCast: Jamie Foxx,\nBeyonc\u00e9 Knowles,\nEddie Murphy\nThe Pursuit of Happyness\nDirector: Gabriele Muccino\nWriter: Steve Conrad\nCast: Will Smith,\nJaden Smith,\nThandie Newton\nof Will Smith\u2019s son \u2013 Jaden Smith. I\nwas excited to see their on-screen\nchemistry and the reason behind\nthe choice to put this kid in there.\nI\u2019m still waiting. It may have been\nthe dialogue, but I saw very little\nfrom him. I was expecting a truly\nmoving performance, some real\nfather-son emotion, or at least\nsomething cute. There is potential though; the one scene where\nhe throws a bit of a tantrum when\nhe realises he and his father have\nbeen locked out of their motel room\n\u2013 I was convinced.\nIn the end, the movie was enter-taining. If you avoid over-analysing\nthe way in which it\u2019s made, you can\nlook past the irritating voice-over,\nand feel warm and fuzzy as the\nmovie does what it sets out to do. It\nentertains you, it makes you laugh\nand cry, it does have a great sto-ryline, and it gives you the classic\n\u2018rags to riches\u2019 feeling. It might just\nbe me (a sucker for all things emo-tional) but I certainly didn\u2019t hate it.\nElizabeth Ross\n\u2018Happiness, shmappiness.

    "content": "Bars again, by the Union President\nI\naccept that the President\u2019s\nview may not hold as much\nauthority as that of an investigative journalist, but for what\nit\u2019s worth, here is my take on\nevents in the bars this summer. To\nbe fair to Andy, his page two article\nin last week\u2019s Felix raised some\nserious issues that deserve discus-sion. The second article, however,\nwas written by a past student living\n200 miles away in Leeds and read\nmore like a Michael Moore conspiracy theory.\nMy side of the story\nI should start by stating the obvi-ous: I didn\u2019t stand for President to\nplay politics with the bars. Events\nand pressure from students have\nleft me and the senior management\nstaff no choice but to intervene.\nWhen I sat down at my desk for\nthe first time last August, I was\npresented with a pile of letters,\nincluding some written by experienced bar staff, which complained\nabout a poor culture and bad working practices on the ground floor\nof Beit. There were accusations of\nstaff drinking on the job, poor stock\ncontrol, poor customer service and\nreports of aggressive behaviour.\nSome of these allegations were\nsupported by my own observations\nand those of my colleagues. So, during the summer and throughout\nthe autumn term, Senior Managers\nand the Sabbs implemented two\nprojects that were designed to address these concerns.\nThe first project was to install\nthe new EPoS (Electronic Point\nof Sale) system, which is designed\nto improve stock control, provide\ntrend analysis and allow us to rapidly react to our members. This\nproject was prepared well before\nI became President, was enthusi-After last week\u2019s focus on the recent restructuring of the Union bars, the Union President, John Collins, has\nasked for space in Felix to explain the changes from his point of view, and respond to Jess & Mez\nastically backed by the Executive\nCommittee and was completed by\nthe start of term.\nThe second project was to tackle\nthe culture and management issues described above. We wanted to\nchange the \u201cBalkanised\u201d culture of\nour trading operations in Beit and\nintegrate them with the new EPoS\nsystem.\nWe created a role for a dynamic\nmanager and brought the whole\nBeit trading operation under one\numbrella. These changes necessitated the restructuring of our\ncatering, entertainments and bars\ndivisions. This created new op-erational, administrative and shift\nleader roles but removed others.\nSome staff took redundancy, some\nmoved jobs and since October five\nnew staff have joined our team. For\nthe record, the bar steward role\nhasn\u2019t changed significantly.\nThe new Trading Manager has\nnot been here for long but regular\ncustomers will have noticed positive changes including chips in the\nevenings, a new pool table in dB\u2019s,\nan expanded catering offer, new\npint glasses and new tables. Plans\nare afoot to further improve our\ncatering offering and service and\nwithin the next few weeks we also\nhope to launch a new wine list and a\npermanent (cheaper) real ale.\nClaims and Counterclaims\nIt has been mentioned that our entertainments cost \u00a327,000 last year.\nThis is true, but our bars also made\nalmost \u00a3177,500 profit last year and\nthese days we treat entertainments\nas a \u201closs leader\u201d. When you add\nentertainments and bars profits for\nthe last few years you will find that,\njointly, profit doubled last year. As\nthe saying goes, you have to spend\nmoney to make money.\nThe successful Christmas Carnival also came under fire. Did you\nknow that in spite of reduced capac-ity, a smoking ban and the fact that\nthe venue was a building site we\nstill took more money this Christmas Carnival than we did in the\nprevious two combined? Clearly\nwe must be doing something right,\nand the hard work of all our staff deserves praise.\nThe Staff Student Protocol\nEven if all of this sounds sensible,\nit doesn\u2019t explain why we have kept\nour student staff in the dark for the\nlast few months. I wish I could have\nbeen more open, but unfortunately\nmy hands were tied.\nI hate to sound like a schoolteacher but I must point out that the\nUnion is an employer and, as such,\nwe are forced to follow employment\nlaw. This law forbids me from discussing restructuring exercises\nin public during the \u201cconsultation\nperiod\u201d. If I or any of our staff had\nbroken this law, there is a chance\nthat legal action could have been\ntaken against the Union. The Felix\nand Live! editors are sensible people and they are fully aware of this\nlaw. At the end of the day it is their\ndecision whether or not to publish\narticles and Andy has explained\nwhy he kept quiet about this matter\nuntil the New Year, when the consultation period finished.\nRoom for improvement?\nReturning to the core issue of our\ntrading outlets, last week\u2019s articles have raised some issues that I\nfreely admit are unsatisfactory. The\nfact that the EPoS system has bugs\nis not disastrous; bugs can be fixed\nand some were removed this week.\nI am, however, concerned about the\n\u201cI should start\nby stating the\nobvious: I\ndidn\u2019t stand for\nPresident to play\npolitics with the\nbars.\u201d\nadvice we received regarding the\ncompatibility of our system with the\nCollege\u2019s cashless system.\nWe do have some inexperienced\nstaff, but this is always the case at\nthe start of the year. I have every\nconfidence that they will learn\nrapidly and soon provide the level\nof service you all expect. I have\nreceived comments from numerous sources complementing the\nfriendliness of our staff, both those\nwho are new and those who are\nexperienced.\nThey have my unequivocal support and I would like to thank them\nfor their great work and commitment to the Union.\nOn a more serious note, I want to\naddress accusations of threats to\nthose bar staff who recently left. If\nthis happened then I need to know.\nThreats are unacceptable, but I am\nnot telepathic and can only take action if I receive a complaint in writ-ing. I can\u2019t discipline staff on the basis of rumour or a Felix article.\nDoes this really matter?\nAt the end of the day, Jess and Mez\nhit the nail on the head when they\nwrotethattheseevents\u201cwentlargely unnoticed by the student population\u201d. This is because our students\nsimply don\u2019t care about the politics\nbehind the bar.

Given the polarising effect that this newspaper\u2019s coverage\nof recent events has had upon the\ncollege, and the poor image it portrays of the Union in general, I am\nsurprised at the omission of a reply\n(as we were originally promised).\nI believe it is a matter for concern\nthat the coverage in its current\nstate, without Ms. Rahman being\ngiven the opportunity to publically\ndefend herself, gives the impression of being nothing but the result\nof personal agendas within the Union, and malicious gossip.\nFor the sake of public faith in Felix, please do print a full rebuttal by\nMs. Rahman, or I shall be forced to\ncancel my subscription.\nYours in hope,\nAjit K. Nunimush\nAndy Sykes replies,\nFirstly, let me say that I appreciate the wonderful odour of Private\nEye letters that permeates your\nmissive above.

    "content": "Hockey). This meant a lot as it\nwould mean that, once distributed,\nthe schools could carry on with the\nsport once we had left.\nNot wishing to bore you all with\nour exciting daily activities but\nThursday is worth a mention, for\nit was our first match. Yes we were\ntaking on Ghana! The team we took\nover really was a cross-section of\nthe club, except for the disproportionate number goalkeepers, with 6\nin total. I don\u2019t know how much you\nknow about hockey, but you do not\nneed 6 goalies on-pitch at once, in\nfact you only need 1, leaving us with\n5 players out of position, weakening\nthe side. Additionally, Delhi Belly\nwas still rife in the camp, we were\nyet to adjust to the humidity and we\nwere playing a national U18 side. Is\nthat enough excuses yet? To cut a\nlong game short, we lost. I can\u2019t remember the score but it was a good\nfight and Plug (one of the goalies)\nmanaged to score a hat trick. The\nIC side showed great dedication,\nbut the all-male side were just too\ngood. As with any match we followed with a good celebration; an\nepic night in the clubs and music\nvenues of Accra \u2013 awesomnal!\nT\noo soon it was time to\nmove away from Accra\nand onto our base for\nthe following week \u2013 a\nschool further north in\nAkosombo, via a lovely weekend of\nfrivolity on a tropical beach. Akosombo was completely different to\nour time in Accra: we were staying\nin a Hotel and were being cooked\nfor by a wonderful teacher who welcomed us into her home every day.\nThe children and activities were\nvery similar, though the hockey\nprogramme was less packed (only\n5 hours a day) so we had time to\nsee a bit more of the country and\nenjoy more of the holiday that you\nmay expect from a tour. This lead\nus to the wonders of Dam Tuesday\nwhen, being engineers, we were\ntold we should go around a huge\ndam on the outskirts of the town;\nand Monkey Wednesday, whch Flat\nEric was slightly too excited about,\nwhen we ventured to a local nature\nreserve for a trek to see monkeys\nand baboons.\nOnce again the children\u2019s sheer\nenjoyment was superb and up-lifting. Half of these children had\nplayed before, but still we managed\nto increase their enthusiasm and\ngive them tips for improving fur-ther. Maria amused them with her\nnorthern accent; it can\u2019t be nice\nbeing mocked by 25 children who\nwere supposed to being coached!\nThe Hoff lost his voice and broke\nhis stick but managed to maintain a\ntrail of admiring young ladies. The\nEdgenator perfected his Ministry of\nSilly Walks (aka dynamic stretches),\nAWOL demonstrated the wonders\nof his stretchy nipple, thankfully\nnot in front of the children. It all finished in one of the largest and most\nmanic Hokey-Cokeys in history.\nThe evenings were far quieter\nthan those in Accra but we still managed to get out and about, sharing\nin the local nightlife where there\nwere bars with gin and no tonic,\nplaces with huge fridges of tonic\n(and much to the annoyance of our\nfriendly G&T addict Dirty Money)\nno gin and nothing in between.\nFar too soon it was time to head\nback to Accra for our final 2 match-es, against 11 of our new friends at\nthe academy. The first match was\nmuch closer; we had just about\nclicked as a team and there were\nfar more girls in the opposing side.\nDuracell was everywhere and doing a great job. Captain Zizu led the\ntroops fantastically with the subs\ncarried out their water duties mag-nificently. We played some brilliant\nhockey, demonstrating all the skills\nwe had been coaching for the last\ncouple of weeks; the locals on the\nsidelines were impressed. Still, we\nwere not quite as fit as the Ghanaians, nor used to the heat (and dare\nI say umpires) so the game ended\nin a draw. The tension was unbelievable and as we knew we would\ndie if we had to play another 30 min-utes, it was agreed to go straight to\nP-Flicks.\nWe had no idea whether this\nwould be in our favour or not. Few\nin our team had ever taken one\nbefore and our keeper had never\nsaved one before. With good efforts\nfrom everyone (and yes some flicks\nsaved by us) we were drawn at the\nend of the first 5. Ooh, the tension.\nMultiple Entry was up next, but unfortunately was AWOL at the side of\nthe pitch, suffering a bit too much\nfrom the night before, but no-fears-Duracell stepped up and scored. We\nlet the next one in \u2013 bugger. Next,\nMultiple Entry made it on pitch\nwith the hopes of IC resting on him\n\u2013 he missed, Mum didn\u2019t save it\n\u2013 match over.\nOn to the last night where we celebrated the last fortnight with new\nfriends, picked up in various bars,\nand danced to the wonders of Polly\nsinging \u201cdo do do do do\u2026 say I love\nyou\u201d (the no. 1 at the time).\nWith another wonderful speech\n(was it the importance of hockey\nand education this time?) and another match we finished our trip. A\nfew too many fizzy pops and sheer\ntiredness meant that, once again,\nwe could do nothing to stop a few\ntoo many goals going in our goal\nand too few in theirs.\nHere we said our goodbyes as\nseveral of us decided we wanted to\nsee more of the country whilst others had the dull-i-ities of work waiting for them back in the UK.\nThe next fortnight had many high-lights, but since it wasn\u2019t part of the\nofficial tour I will be brief. Sick Note\nwas better and celebrated this by\nsharing a bed with far too many of\nthe remaining group. We were ambushed by an over-excited Flat Eric\nand Sick Note wearing not very\nmuch in a hotel after doing a cunning split and re-meet situation and\nthe days we had planned to be on the\nbeach picking up a tan were those\nfew days when it started to rain. We\nmanaged to explore a larger range\nof the country and spent an awful\nlot of time on tours, but it was great\nto see more. Being back for a while\nnow has given us a chance to re-flect. We all still raise a smile about\nthe experience which has given us\nall much more confidence in our\ncoaching abilities (which apply to\nour own teams) whilst performing\na nice supporting role for the association there.\nOur schools have just competed\nin their first school\u2019s hockey tournament and the work seems to be ticking along nicely. Granted it might\nnot have been a typical hockey tour\nand our skills and technical areas\nmay not have improved much, but\nwe did manage to publicise the\nsport and bring it to schools that\nwere in need of a helping hand to\nget started. We also have far more\nconfidence and skill in planning for\ncoaching within our own teams.\nThank you to everyone who came\non tour for the enthusiasm and\npatience they all had. Also, thanks\nto the IC Trust, Harlington Trust,\nCarvers, Mercian Hockey and everyone who helped us along the way\nto make the tour as successful as it\nwas.\n27\nfelix\nFriday 2 February 2007\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGotta have a montage.

    "content": "Flashback: Keeping in its Prime\nHugh Mansfield takes a look back at Nintendo\u2019s best-loved sci-fi adventures in the Metroid series\nS\ntick a gun into a game,\nand the chances are the\npoint of it will be to blow\nindiscriminate holes into\nanything, or preferably\nanyone, that moves. Unless it\u2019s an\nAgatha Christie-esque point-and-click in which the gun plays some\nkind of important role as evidence\nor never gets fired except in a Chekov-inspired denouement leading\nto shock, horror and one of the less\nlesser alternate endings. What generally doesn\u2019t happen is that the\ngun becomes the only direct interface with the environment, acting\nas a puzzle-solving tool every bit as\nmuch as it is a weapon.\nThe Metroid series is all-but-unique in this regard \u2013 to all intents\nand purposes they look like generic\nsci-fi platformers or first person\nshooters, but they have far more in\ncommon with the likes of the Legend of Zelda series (or, to put it another way, with the Legend of Zelda\nseries). In many ways, Metroid is to\nscience fiction games what Zelda\nis to fantasy ones \u2013 it makes more\nsense to compare it with that than\nwith the likes of Halo, since the similarities there are pretty superficial.\nThe most striking difference with\nZelda is that whilst both appeal to\ngamers of all ages, Zelda is aimed\nprimarily at children. This comes\nacross in the more developed storyline as opposed to the vague\nfragments typical of Metroid\ngames \u2013 the plots in\nhaven\u2019t a clue what you were meant\nto be doing.\nWhile doing so, it becomes possible to find more and more powerups\nto expand your health bar, your missile capacity, and suchlike, a fact\nwhich allows for the difficulty curve\nto be far steeper as you progress\nfurther through\nthe game\nsince by\nthe end\nyou\ncould be due to the absence of any\nreleases between Super Metroid on\nthe SNES and Metroid Prime on\nthe Gamecube, during which period gaming saw an enormous boom\nand game franchises became more\nfamiliar to consumers.\nSuch was the gap, in fact, that\nmost Nintendo followers expected\nthe transition to 3D to fail utterly\n\u2013 that Prime would turn out to be\njust a run-of-the-mill FPS, rather\nthan being a logical continuation\nof its successors so many years\nbeforehand. And indeed, many of\ntheir fears were realised when it\ntranspired that a lot of the of the\nfoibles and fripperies that made the\noriginal games so unique would be\nlacking due to the impossibilities of\nimplementing them in 3D \u2013 these\nincluded the high-speed running\nthat only proved feasible on smooth\nterrain \u2013 a simple enough request in\n2D, but in 3D this would have meant\nmaking the landscapes in which it\ncould be utilised utterly drab; the\nsuper jump, in which Samus would\nlaunch herself into the air, breaking through any brittle landscape\nin the way; the spin attack, allowing almost infinite jumping\nprovided you face the correct\ndirection, and so on.\nAnd yet, somehow they\nmanaged to make it one of\nthe best 3D conversions\nof a 2D series to date\n\u2013 better even than the\nlikes of Mario and Zelda \u2013 certainly better\nthan the horrific\nmutilations that\nthe later Sonic\ngames became.\nIt\u2019s a subtle su-periority, and\none that only\ncomes clear\nthrough playing.\nGo now, and you\nwon\u2019t regret it.\nare likely to have fifty times as\nmany missiles as at the beginning,\nand twenty times as much health.\nThe developers have always been\nsure to make the later enemies far\nmore likely to knock ginormous\namounts of life off the player and to\nrequire all the resources they can\npossibly spare. It also becomes important to ensure you use the correct weapon, as the idea that better\nweapons should be able to destroy\neverything with greater ease has\nbeen rejected utterly by the developers \u2013 there is often a very specific\nmethod of defeating each enemy,\nneccessitating a wide range of\ntactics. It keeps things inter-esting, no matter how varied\nyour arsenal.\nIt seems strange, then,\nthat Metroid is far less well\nknown than the likes of\nMario or Zelda, from the\nsame stable, but much of\nthis\nZelda are all-im-portant to the\ngameplay,\nwhereas it\ncan happily be ignored in\nMetroid\nin favour\nof blithely blasting one\u2019s\nway\nthrough\nthe game.\nZelda\u2019s\nstorylines\nput huge emphasis on moral\ncharacteristics\nthat the makers\nfeel children ought to\nbe taught about \u2013 moral\nfortitude, courage, purity of\nheart, or whatever. Of course,\nthere is a certain grey area surrounding vandalism and theft, in\nthat you are positively encouraged\nto \u2013 for want of a more poetic phrase\n\u2013 smash the fuck out of everything\nin order to nab a few rupees, but\nthat\u2019s easy to ignore.\nOn the other hand, Metroid is positively amoral \u2013 there is no sense of\n\u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 \u2013 the protagonist,\nSamus Aran, is a bounty hunter\nwhose targets are a crowd of space\npirates (a fact that shouldn\u2019t be ig-nored, since everyone loves pirates,\nand everyone loves space \u2013 or at\nleast, everyone who loves games\ndoes, pretty much) \u2013 the only motivations of any of those involved are\naspects of self-interest; money and\nsurvival.\nWhereas most games covering\nsuch topics do their best to hammer this point home, to the extent\nthat they become irritating to play\nthanks to an anachronistic anti-corporate theme running\nthroughout, the approach here is\nconsiderably more subtle \u2013 it\u2019s\nbarely even mentioned.\nThere is no conception of \u2018levels\u2019\nin the traditional sense \u2013 the central conceit of the game is an exploratory one, and there\nis constant backtracking over\nold ground\nonce\nnew weapons or abilities have\nbeen gained, not only\nbreathing new life into areas that\nwould have become stale long ago\notherwise, but also cleverly stacking parts of the game on top of each\nother, making the most efficient use\nof the space available.\nOnly if you forget entirely where\nyou were meant to be going does it\never become even remotely boring\n\u2013 and the later games even come\nup with reminders about\nwhere to go once\nit becomes\nclear you\nSamus in her 2D prime.

Audi immediately played the\nball behind the 4th\u2019s defence, down\nthe left, finding Scott Greening, previously of the 4th team, who slotted\nthe ball past O\u2019Neill.\nThe first half continued to be\nplayed at pace with a high degree of\nskill. The 3rds created some clear-cut chances; Deu played the ball\ndown the left to Greening, in a similar position to when he opened the\nscoring. This time he had less luck,\nforcing a good save out of O\u2019Neill.\nJust when it looked like the 4ths\nmight get back into it, the 3rds went\n2-0 up, five minutes before half time.\nThe ball was played from defence to\nDeu, who flicked it, with his head,\ndown the left flank to Greening\nOn Saturday 27th January, IC 3rds\nfaced IC 4ths in the first round of the\nULU Men\u2019s Reserves Cup. There\nwas potential for an upset, with the\n3rds not having played this term,\nwhile the 4ths had played twice and\nappeared to be in good form.\nThe match started under controversial circumstances; the referee,\nknown as \u2018Tramp\u2019 by some, declared\nhe: \u201cwould not play offsides\u201d, since\nthe 3rd team could not provide a\nlinesman. After some debate with\n3rd\u2019s captain, James Blyth, a compromise was met, where he: \u201cwould\nplay offsides in the 18 yard box\u201d.\nEarly exchanges suggested the\nmatch would be good one, played\nat a fast pace. Rickards and Noone\nlived up to their billing, zipping the\nball around the midfield. Meanwhile, the 3rds looked dangerous\nwho ran down the flank, covered by\na defender. He then cut back onto\nhis right foot inside the box, neatly\nplacing the ball just inside O\u2019Neill\u2019s\nnear post.\nIn the second half the game became a lot more competitive; the\ntackles, and the occasional late\nchallenge, started to fly in as the\n4ths were determined to get back\ninto the game.\nFor the first part of the second\nhalf, the 4ths were still forced into\nlong-range efforts. One of which\nnearly got the better of Botchway,\nwith the keeper just managing to\nclaw Noone\u2019s 30-yard effort away\nfrom the top corner with one hand.\nAt the other end, Deu found himself\non the edge of the box on the right-hand side, he cut inside, he went\ndown under a challenge from Scott\nMackenzie, convinced he should be\nawarded a penalty. The referee said\nno and play continued.\nThe 4ths immediately responded\nby scoring; the ball was chipped\nover to Viktor Jensen, a clear beneficiary of the referee\u2019s no-offside\npolicy, who cleverly clipped the ball\npast Botchway to make the score 2-1 with 25 minutes still to play.\nThe 3rds could easily have pan-icked, allowing the 4ths back into\nthe match; instead, they stayed\nresolute. The two Masters in midfield (Adam and Stewart) continued\ntheir high work-rate, stifling the\nthreat of Noone and Rickards, protecting the defence.\nWith 15 minutes to go, Stewart\nMasters won a free kick on the right\ncorner of the box.

Dog grooming centres,\ndoggy diets, dog \u2018hotels\u2019 (not to\nmention the \u2018bling\u2019 that you can buy\nfor your pampered pooch) are just\nthe start of it. But maybe they are\nnot so far wrong in imagining the\nspecial \u2018bond\u2019 between themselves\nand their pets. Cognitive Scientists\nat Kyoto University in Japan have\ndiscovered that dogs have the capacity to associate their owner\u2019s\nvoice with a mental image of their\nface.\nIn the experiment, dogs were\nplaced in view of a computer moni-tor, hidden by a screen, and subjected to a sound recording of either\ntheir owner or a stranger repeating\nthe dog\u2019s name. The screen was\nthen removed to reveal an image of\nthe owner, or a stranger.\nDogs who heard the voice of their\nowner and then a corresponding\nimage (or the same for the voice\nand image of a stranger) looked at\nthe monitor displaying the image\nfor an average of 6 seconds. However, where the voice and image did\nnot correspond, the dogs examined\nthe monitor for longer, suggesting\nsome form of confusion.\nIkuma Adachi, the lead researcher in the team, has concluded that\nthe dogs build up a mental image of\ntheir owner on hearing their voice,\nand are confounded when the image they see does not match up\nwith that in their head. These findings are yet another example of\nthe adaptations to humans that canines have undergone during their\ndomestication. Dogs are already\nknown for their superiority over\napes in interpreting human gesture\n\u2013 now it seems that it is not a dog\nowner\u2019s fantasy that little Rover\ncan \u2018recognise his mummy\u2019 after\nall.\nKrystyna Larkham\nScience Editor\nTo many men around the world,\nit may seem that their girlfriends\nlose all their brain cells altogether\nwhen they go shopping. Floating\non a seemingly non existent breeze\nfrom shoe shop to shoe shop, to\nperfumery and then the latest third\nworld crippling department store\nand finally back to the initial shoe\nshop to return the pair of ugg boots\nthat she\u2019s gone off in the space of\nfour hours, it can be a mind boggling world inside the head of your\nfairer side.\nHowever, Brian Knutson, a neuroscientist at Stanford, has managed\nto identify the areas of the brain associated with decision making when\nRetail psychology testing\nshopping. And the results have interesting implications for those suffering from a shopping addiction.\nNB: according to a female friend\nof mine, 100 pairs of shoes is not an\naddiction. Felix will leave that to\nyou to decide.\nKnutson and his team, made up\nof researchers from MIT and Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, set up a \u2018mock shop\u2019 in their\nlab, containing a range of \u2018desirable\u2019 items, including Sex And The\nCity DVDs (hmm), MP3 players,\nGodiva chocolates, and a Stanford\nT-shirt (?!!).\nSubjects were then issued with\n\u2018store credit\u2019 to enable them to\nmake purchases, and placed with\ntheir heads inside an MRI scanner,\nto locate the areas of the brain involved with making decisions.\nIt appeared that when on viewing\na desirable object, a region of the\nsubjects\u2019 brain, known as the nucleus accumbens, was activated.\nThis region is linked to the anticipation of gain. However, when confronted with the price of the object,\nand judged it too much, the insula\nand the mesial prefrontal cortex,\nboth regions of the brain associated\nwith anticipation of loss and pain,\nwere activated.\nInterestingly for those with a higher than average shoe fetish (girls)\nor an unhealthy relationship with\nGAME, the nucleus accumbens is\nan area of the brain also linked to\naddiction, opening the door for further experiments.\nBut for now, these results show\nonly one thing. It is not just you who\nfeels the pain on handing over your\ncredit card, your brain feels it too.\n(And your bank manager. But that\u2019s\nanother story).\nKrystyna Larkham\nApologies for a mistake last week. Colin Barras was author of the ar-ticle, Chemical warfare \u2013 biobricking it, rather than Krystyna Larkham.\nHowever, the awful title was made up by Tomo.

    "content": "Flashback: When war became hell\nMy Grandson asked me, \u201cGranpa, were you a hero in the war?\u201d And I tell him, \u201cNo. But I pwned some.\u201d\nB\nOOM! The first time you\njoined a Battlefield 1942\nserver, this was very likely the first thing that hap-pened. Whether it was a\ntank, an airplane or a destroyer really didn\u2019t matter, it was still bigger\nthan anything anyone had seen be-fore. From the get-go, it was clear\nthat Battlefield was something dif-ferent. It wasn\u2019t a claustrophobic\nspace-shooter like Quake or Unreal, it wasn\u2019t a slow sneak\u2019n\u2019peek\nshooter like Counter-Strike. This\nwas war.\nWithin hours of the demo being re-leased, teams were popping up eve-rywhere. Everyone knew that this\nwas going to be different, a game\nwhere teamplay mattered, where\nstrategy mattered and twitch gaming wasn\u2019t king. The team size alone\nwas indicative of this \u2013 the community settled for 10 on 10, twice as\nlarge as anything gaming had seen\nbefore. The teams that wanted to\nremain competitive spent hours\nevery week trying to find the most\noutlandish strategies imaginable.\nIt started off innocently enough,\nsomeone throwing a few sticks of\ndynamite onto a jeep and driving\noff with it, only to find that the dynamite stayed in the jeep. Then, it was\nan extra person. Next, five people.\nJeeps quickly became rapid deployment vehicles for entire teams, as\nwell as being tank-busters when\nloaded with dynamite.\nNo one knows quite how the next\ndevelopment came about, but after\na while wingwalking was discov-ered. Wingwalking is, as the name\nimplies, having people walk on the\nwings of an airplane while it is in\nflight. This alone was revolutionary,\nand maps with planes became a lot\nmore unpredictable defensively.\nThe enemy could drop 6-8 players\nanywhere on the map at any time,\nand frontlines became irrelevant\nfor the defender. It was sneaky, it\nwas hilarious, it was brilliant fun.\nOther developments followed, like\ntank-diving (driving a tank through\nwater before it \u201cdrowned\u201d), gre-nade-jumping (like Quake\u2019s rock-etjumps) and repair engineers (en-gineers who stayed behind a tank\nrepairing it constantly \u2013 essentially\ngiving it double the durability).\nSome were fixed, others weren\u2019t,\nbut it didn\u2019t matter because it was\nall FUN. There was nothing that\ngave either side an unfair advan-tage, they were all just new aspects\nto be taken into consideration.\nEveryone had differing tactics on\nevery map \u2013 some choosing to go\nfor a sneaky assault from behind,\nothers just sticking to a massive\ncoordinated push.It was after about\na year of this that some people became too clever for their own good.\nThe first of these events was gre-nade-spamming, which meant that\na person standing next to a supply\nbox had infinitely many grenades,\nand could spend a full round doing\nnothing but pelting an area with ex-plosives. City maps changed from\ndynamic, unpredictable games to\nslow, meticulously planned assaults\nto get one extra flag; and then fall\nback and defend it for the rest of the\nround. After that, it all went down-hill.Pixel-shootingmeantthattanks\nand fixed gun placements could fire\nto the other end of the map and accurately hit the enemy\u2019s airplanes\nand tanks \u2013 without the opposition\nbeing able to touch them. As a slew\nof minor exploits were found, more\nand more maps became unplayable\nin matches, and the competitive\nmap list fell from 16 to 8 maps in a\nmatter of months.\nIn a strange way, the reason for\nBattlefield 1942\u2019s demise was the\nsame reason for its success \u2013 the\ndevelopers didn\u2019t try to limit their\nplayers. The game engine allowed\nteams to come up with new ways to\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s too quiet, I\u2019m just saying I expected it to be louder.\u201d\nthink of the maps, and unbounded\ncreativity took its toll. As every\nteam raced to find that edge over\nthe others, the limits of what was\nacceptable were tested and slowly\nbuckled under the pressure. Ultimately, however, the game holds a\nplace in history for embodying the\nconcept of synergy \u2013 a team is better than the sum of the individuals.\nIn a game that allowed such bizarre\nand madcap tactics, it\u2019s still come\ncloser to defining true teamplay\nthan any game before or any game\nsince.\nSebastian Nordgren\nAltogether!

Photo: \u00a9 RMN/Blot and Jean\nShaw gives a\nlesson in small talk\nFiona Shaw as Winnie in Happy Days now showing at the National Theatre\nThis much-delayed exhibition of the\ndevelopment of portraiture in the\nlate 18th and early 19th centuries,\nseems, on the surface, more like\nthe pages of a history book than an\nimportant art exhibition.\nOn entering you are faced with the\nimposing figure of Napoleon on his\nImperial throne, flanked by Louis\nXVI and Marie Antoinette. Moving\nthrough the whos-who list of portraits is ever more impressive, with\nkings, philosophers and politicians\nlining the walls of the gallery. Not\nto say that seeing the faces of the\npeople who shaped our society to\nsuch an extent isn\u2019t interesting, but\nthese portraits are so much more\nthan records of their existence.\nTake the portraits of Napoleon\n(Ingres, 1906) and Louis XVI (Cal-let, 1789), for example. They sit next\nto each other in the first room and\nwere painted less than 20 years\napart, yet the style and impression\nof the portraits are very different.\nThe portrait of the doomed king is\nalmost pastel in its shades, and exposes a man of wealth and luxury.\nNapoleon, on the other hand, is\nan imposing portrait full of symbols\nof power like the eagle and laurel\nwreath of Imperial Rome. The background is dark and the figure rides\nHappy Days\nby Samuel Beckett\nNational Theatre\nUntil March 1st\nHer situation is a kind of hell, a life\ncontrolled by a bell for waking and a\nbell for sleep, though she refuses to\nsee it as that.\nBeckett\u2019s plays famously contain\nparticularly meticulous stage di-rections, and as such could lead a\nlesser actor to become complacent\nin their role.\nShaw, however, takes over the\ncharacter so much that by the end\nher acceptance of being immobile\nin a pile of dirt seems completely\nnatural.\nWhen, in the second half, her head\nis all that protrudes, from the rubble\nI was desperate for someone to put\nher out of her misery with the ever-so-tempting revolver lying nearby,\nbut she is as resolute as ever. Her\noptimism seems to hold her up, and\nher speech is like the gasps of air of\nsomeone drowning.\nA particularly hypnotic piece, this\nis a good introduction to Beckett.\nEmily Lines\nArts Editor\nHaving never seen Fiona Shaw on\nstage before, I was sceptical about\nthis, the NT\u2019s new production of\nSamuel Beckett\u2019s Happy Days.\nGenuinely talented actors are\npassed up for roles far too often in\nTheatreland in favour of big screen\nnames, often, in my opinion, to the\ndetriment of the production.\nHowever, having seen her sit\nhalf-encased in a mound of post-apocalyptic rubble and make Beckett\u2019s endless stream of monotonous dialogue come alive I am all\nadmiration.\nWith little more than a couple of\nprops and her own gestures, the\nprotagonist Winnie (Shaw) surveys her life and pushes herself\nthrough her day, seeing the best in\neverything.\nIndeed, despite its setting, the\nplay is very easy to relate to. Everyone knows a couple like this, the\nwife endlessly chattering whilst the\nhusband completely ignoring her.\nBut that\u2019s not to say that this is an\nuplifting play to watch. Very funny\nin places, it paints a terrifying picture of the pointlessness of life,\ncomplete with a silent (and possibly\nmasturbating) husband, and the little rituals that get us through the\nday.\nout of the painting like the bow of\na ship emerging from the dark,\nhis robes flowing like the waves on\nthe ocean. Painted just a couple of\nyears after he became Emperor\nof France, the portrait would have\nbeen used to cement his political\nposition.\nA later portrait of Napoleon by\nDavid (himself a prominent French\nrevolutionary) shows a more realistic portrayal, as he stands by\nhis desk after apparently working\nthrough the night. The steady expression on the emperor\u2019s face,\nthough more human, is nonetheless challenging, and in some ways\nhis power as a man seems greater\nfor being exposed yet authoritative.\nMovingthroughtheexhibition,the\nemphasis shifts from monarchs to\nphilosophers and scientists. These\nimages, of Goethe, Hume, Hutton,\nRousseau and Voltaire, amongst\nothers, shows the shift of society towards the Age of Enlightenment, a\nperiod of scientific and philosophic\ninnovation.\nRauch\u2019s sculptures of Goethe are\na fine example of this shift. Dressed\nas a Roman senator, and posed\ndeep in thought, he has all the\npresence of a great figure, but with\nmuch more realism, expressing the\nrationality of thinking of the time.\nPigalle\u2019s Voltaire Nude is, at first\nglance, a classical statue, but on\ncloser inspection you see the sags,\nwrinkles and veins of his aged body,\na style which is not particularly\neasy to view.\nFor me, the most interesting\nroom in the exhibition was the one\ndedicated to images of the artists\nthemselves, both painted by contemporaries and by themselves.\nNot suffering from the egos and\ncommercialism of commissioned\npieces, these paintings show a development of the intimacy of por-traiture. Several, most noticeably\nK\u00f8ble\u2019s self-portrait, are surprisingly modern in their textured, and\nreminded me of Lucian Freud.\nThe exhibition also has some humorous moments. In the section on\nAllegorical Portraiture you can see\nthe ordinary bulbous English faces\nof the new upwardly mobile classes\nof the late 18th century painted as\nGreek gods or figures from mythol-ogy. Commissioned to show their\nelevated rank, the portraits are\nmostly laughable, a notable exception being Reynold\u2019s gothic Mrs.\nSiddons as the Tragic Muse.\nThe final room of the exhibition\nis dedicated portraiture after the\ndefeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.\nDespite the efforts of royalists to\nrestore the dynasties of old Europe,\nthe middle-classes had risen and\nrepublican spirit continued. This is\nshown in Ingres\u2019 Monsieur Bertin,\nwhere the gruff and powerful editor\nof the liberal \u2018Journal des d\u00e9bats\u2019,\na portrait where the intellect and\nconviction of the sitter supplants\nhis social standing.\nEmily Lines\nNEIL LIBBERT\nMissed the Arts section?\nWant free tickets to the\ntheatre?

    "content": "Wandering in a windy wonderland\nThe trip began on a Friday with the\ngroup splitting in twain to travel at\ndifferent times to Snowdonia. The\nsecond bus started out late but due\nto some skilled driving by the big\nman himself (Tim) good time was\nmade and the first bus was left eating the dust of his passing. Dinner\nwas served in typical style at KFC\n\u2013 a good lining of grease is an important start to the weekend.\nSomething was going far too\nsmoothly however and the fickle\nGod of fellwanderers trips decided\nto have his way. Kathrin, now driving the second bus, fell foul as the\nold banger started to protest under\nthe pedals. A short delay ensued\nwith all the wanderers meeting at\nthe \u2018Dobbies Garden World\u2019 island\nto exchange thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously the engine misfiring\u201d, said\nTim and Dave, \u201cA diesel can\u2019t misfire\u201d, said Nathaniel.\nMeanwhile, Kathrin was having\n\u2018a bit of a mare\u2019 as she proceeded\nto jam the bus keys in the fuel cap.\nCue more frustration and it looking\nlike it was going to be one of those\nweekends. However, in the end it all\nsorted itself out, and after a hasty\ncall to the RAC they were on their\nway again.\nObviously the intrepid travellers\nhad eventually made their way to\nSt Mary\u2019s Hut in Snowdonia and\nawoke early on Saturday, hungry\nfor some walking and a vegan brek-kie. The wind was blowing an absolute hoolie, and so some of the more\ntechnical walks were put aside, and\na simpler walk up the Pyg Track to\nSnowdon became the favoured option for the day.\nSetting out from the car park (SH\n647 556), the weather looked fine\nif a little breezy (hurricane speed\nwinds for sure \u2013 it was gusting 100\nat Pen-y-Pass) and the group were\nwrapped up warm and in high spir-it. The track was clear and some\nof the party took the alternative\n\u2018more interesting\u2019 routes on offer,\nwith some decent scrambling led\nby Nathaniel. Eventually after a sedate trek uphill the party closed on\nthe peak, a break was had to wrap\nup and the summit was braved.\nThe effect of the howling wind was\nquickly felt; those actually attempting to climb to the very peak clung\non for grim death while the others\ncoped with the icy conditions that\nhad overtaken the mountain in light\nof the severe wind chill. Andy did a\ngood job of weighing Evelyne down\nas the wind threatened to pick her\noff her feet.\nRather surprisingly lunch was\nhad on the summit. However, Alex\nsoon lost the feeling in his fingers,\nand Chris\u2019 gentlemanly offer of a\nwarm cup of coffee went awry when\nthe wind blew it into Sarah\u2019s face.\nNeedless to say the party layered\nup yet again and the majority, minus Andy, Kathrin and Chris who\nwent back to the minibuses, set off\ndown the hill fairly quickly on the\nSnowdon Ranger Path, Dave taking\ntime to test out his new trekking\npoles. Taking the southerly path\n(SH 573 552) to Glan-yr-Afon (SH\n571 541), heading west to the A4085,\nand turning south again for a swift\nmarching along the road to the pub\nat Rhyd-Ddu, where we met up with\nAndy, and not long after Kathrin and\nChris who took the wrong turning!\nThe evening was one of strange\ngames, allergic reactions and\ndrunken debauchery. After a brief\nstop at the local, Tim, Sarah and\nChris handled the cooking of a\npasta dinner coming in three separate varieties: veggie, vegan and\ncarnivorous.\nPints of dirty cheap wine were the\norder of the day and the evening\nstarted out in earnest with a decent fire started by Nathaniel, who\nmade a good effort as he had only\nwet wood to work with. A game of\n\u2018Werewolf\u2019 then began.\nA vicious psychological battle ensued in which the villagers won after Dave sold out his mate Alex to\nthe mob. At this point Tim\u2019s stomach decided to take offence to the\nmost inoffensive of fungi, the humble Quorn worked its terrible magic\nand the evening ended with everyone settling down to bed.\nDisaster! A severe drought of\nbread struck the hut! Andy left on a\nbold rescue mission early the next\nmorning to find a Welshman stupid\nenough to open up that early on a\nSunday. Fortunately, baked produce\nwas soon secured and with the easing of Tim\u2019s stomach the day took\na turn for the better and the group\ndecided to attack Cnicht. Some\nspectacular views were seen (check\nout the photos) and yet again it was\nexceptionally windy.\nThe day had its ups and downs,\nthe wind taking its toll but all the\nscrambling and stunning landscapes more than making up for it.\nThe fellwanderers set out from the\ncar park at Croesor, northwest up\na track onto the northeasterly path\n(SH 628 450) to the summit, taking\nthe path to the right at SH 632 455.\nHowever, the best thing was the\nsnow on the peak, its discovery set\nthe trip back a good half hour as\neveryone stopped to have a good\nole\u2019 snowball fight. Chris caught a\nfew in the face as he, Dave and Alex\ndeclared an all out war.\nHeading over the summit and\nalong the path, turning southeast\nat SH 657 477. Lunch was had in\na picturesque, crumbling mining\nvillage (SH 665 462) in the depths\nof Wales. The descent back to the\nbuses started with a good scramble down to a southwesterly path\noff the disused rail track (SH 661\n462), Nathaniel choosing to ignore\nthe bridge a few feet in front of him\nin favour of leading the group down\none his infamous \u2018more interesting\nroutes\u2019 \u2013 risk of death/scoring fall\nover points included or your money\nback.\nThe walk down to the buses\npassed without incident. The wanderers turned to the west through a\nfield (SH 643 452) and down a track\nonto the road back to the car park.\nThe trip ended with a traditional\nteatime stop off in Gaydon to relax\nand enjoy a decent pub dinner at\nThe Malt Shovel Inn. Again good\ntime was made by Tim in the driving seat to ensure Alex only had to\nstay up till 3:30 to (nearly) finish his\nreports for the next day.\nThis trip\u2019s brave adventurers\nwere: Tim (head honcho) Scarbrough, Nathaniel Bottrell, Chris\nMark,Sarah(ex-headhoncho)Kingdon, Christine Smith, Dave Hankin,\nAlex De Rosa, Martin (the semi-na-ked German) Mechelhoff, Kathrin\nStephan, Nils Carqueville, Angela\nMeyer, Evelyne Dohon, Andy Roberts, Pang Zi Yang?, Rohan Nanda,\nWilfred Yung, Robin Small, Daniel\nHepenstrick, Johanna Conle.\nThe Fellwanderers organise weekend trips such as this every fort-night; day walks in and around\nLondon are also fortnightly.

    "content": "Wish on a shooting satellite\nChina\u2019s January 11th test launch\nwhich destroyed one of its old\nweather satellites in polar orbit certainly raised a few eyebrows in the\ninternational community. A medium range ballistic missile was used,\nsplintering the defunct satellite into\na shower of space junk that threatens other orbital objects nearby.\n40,000 fragments to be precise, according to David Wright of the \u2018Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019.\nNews of this incident, however,\nonly emerged on January 19th after some Pentagon officials made\na statement that they had observed\nit. \u201cIrresponsible\u201d and \u2018unacceptable behaviour in space\u201d was how\nthe Bush administration reacted to\nthe test. Interestingly, the Chinese\ngovernment did not acknowledge\nthe event until last Tuesday.\nClearly the capability to destroy\nsatellites is a significant develop-ment,technologicallyandpolitically,\nwith only the US and Russia having\nalso demonstrated such abilities.\nA US Centre for Defence Information report usefully points out that\nsatellites are used in \u201ctracking the\nmigration of endangered sea turtles\u201d. Indeed, satellites are the eyes\nand ears of any powerful military,\nas well as being the tool for global\ncommunication.\nA Chinese foreign minister stat-ed: \u201cAs the Chinese Government,\nour principle stand is to promote\nthe peaceful use of space.\n\u201cWe oppose the militarisation of\nspace. In the past, in the present\nand in the future, we are opposed\nto any arms race in space\u201d he went\non to say, in the face of consecutive\n10% increases in military spending since 1990 by the emerging\npower, not including developments\nprograms.\nSuch words almost seem ironic,\nbut, as most analysts will happily\nand speedily point out, such figures\npale in comparison to US numbers;\nAmerican Military expenditure still\nmanages to eclipse the rest of the\nworld put together. Most signifi-cantly, it has been the Bush administration who, up until now, have\nCameron\u2019s bringing down the cohesion barriers\nThis week saw the Conservative\nleader David Cameron join his Labour counterparts in his very own\nscaremongering campaign.\nIn a speech outlining steps to\nbring down the barriers to social\ncohesion he attacked the British\nNational Party (BNP) for preaching\n\u201cpure hate\u201d. He continued: \u201cAnd\nthose who seek a Shariah state, or\nspecial treatment and a separate\nlaw for British Muslims are, in\nmany ways, the mirror image of the\nBNP\n.\u201d\nA Shariah state in Britain! Either\nMr Cameron really believes there\nis such a threat in which case I\nwould ask him to name one major\nMuslim organisation that is calling\nfor this. Or he knows better and is\ndeliberately preying on peoples\u2019\nfears. Regardless, it seems that he\nhas no problem basing his political\nproposals on the exaggeration of\nobscure surveys.\nMr Cameron also said, \u201cYoung\nwhite men are told: \u2018The blacks are\nall criminals\u2019. Young Afro-Caribbean men are told: \u2018The Asian shopkeepers are ripping you off\u2019. Young\nMuslim men are told: \u2018The British\nwant to destroy Islam\u2019,\u201d later add-ing: \u201cThe best answer to ignorance\nlike this is a good education.\u201d\nWell, it seems a good education\nhasn\u2019t helped him in this regard.\nFor his very own words can easily\nbe paraphrased, \u201cYoung Brits are\nruled out a treaty ban on the mili-tarisation of space; one the Russians and Chinese have been calling for in fact. The US has a whole\nportfolio of possible developments\nincluding the \u2018Brilliant Pebbles\u2019\nsystem which scatters an array of\n\u2018intelligent\u2019 droids in the way of a\nmassive ballistic missile assault,\nand \u2018Rods from God\u2019, a space based\nlaunch weapon which is quite self\nexplanatory.\nAmerica\u2019s resumption of so called\n\u2018Star Wars\u2019 technology research in\n1999 under a Clinton mired in oral\nsex scandals, and the withdrawal\nfrom the 1972 ban on anti ballistic\nmissile systems in 2002 under President Bush is quoted as the reasons\nfor China\u2019s foray into such unearthly weapons. Only time will tell if this\nmove encourages the US to agree\nto not develop a new generation of\nweaponry, or if it sparks the next\ngreat arms race \u2013 to conquer the\nbig black void.\ntold: \u2018The Muslims want to destroy\nBritain\u2019.\u201d Further, he said, \u201cThey\nalso want to divide people into \u2018us\u2019\nand \u2018them\u2019. And they too seek out\ngrievances to exploit.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d he\nsays. \u201cThey and we\u201d, is that not\nthe same as \u201cus and them\u201d?

He said: \u201cInspiring as well\nas demanding loyalty from every\ncitizen will require a new crusade\nfor fairness.\u201d The Crusades were\nChristian military campaigns from\nthe 11th century onwards which\naimed to recapture Jerusalem and\nthe Holy Land from Muslim rule.\nA Conservative Party spokesman\ninsisted that the reference had not\nAdil Hussein\nbeen intended to cause offence.\nPerhaps, but it was sloppy use\nof language by an election hopeful\nnonetheless, particularly after US\nPresident George W Bush caused\ncontroversy by calling for a \u201ccrusade\u201d against terrorism following\nthe 9/11 attacks.\nThe Debate on the role of British Islam continues to spread as the Tory leader likens Muslims to the BNP because of calls for an Islamic law\nY\nou might consider\nthat I have ingested a\nhome-made cocktail of\nhippy juice or LSD, but\nI assure you that I have\ndone no such thing.\nIn this terrifying world of a rising\nsuperpower, a weary titan nation,\ndiminishing societal cohesion, the\ncracking of postmodernism\u2019s ideals\nand my itchy spot just on that part\nof the back that you can\u2019t reach (five\nyears of medical education and I\nstill don\u2019t know its name \u2013 Hippocrates would hang his head in shame),\ncan\u2019t we just all get along?\nWhen so much in the world is\nchanging, it is fortunate that in\nBritain we have a culture in which\nwe can challenge each other con-genially, learn from the experience\nand move on. Life is very short\nindeed. There will always be disagreements between people, and\nperhaps we will be able to loosely\ndefine \u201cBritish-ness\u201d, but that will\nalways be subject to the objection of\nothers. Values are not contained by\nnations, nor made correct by them.\nHowever, whatever the vehement\ndifferences in what we believe, for\nthe most part let us breath a sigh of\nrelief. We are able to get along with\nour studies, work and ultimately\nour lives with the most minimal of\nhassle. Isn\u2019t a society where we all\nagree to get along pretty well off?\n\n"

Bigot and Lube\nBoy thoughtfully managed to book\na twelve seater minibus for over\ntwenty students, so the majority of\nus, including the committee, had to\nendure the pains of waiting for and\neventually riding a London bus.\nUpon arrival we were kitted out\nwith suits, helmets and our very\nown number plates, so that we could\nidentify the sod who had flipped his\nkart and was burning down at turn\nthree. Tensions were high and it\nprobably didn\u2019t help that one of the\ncorners was called \u2018Casualty\u2019. Each\nkarter was to compete in five heats,\nwith five karts per heat, starting once from each position (1st\nthrough 5th). Points to be awarded\nat the end of each race.\nWhoever had the balls to charge\nfrom the back, by skill or by having\neveryone else in front smash into\neach other, would get most points.\nPoints are then tallied and a series\nof finals take place, with the slowest people put in \u2018Final D\u2019. The top\nthree from there are then allowed\nto join the end of \u2018Final C\u2019, the top\nthree from there going into\u2026 you\nget the point? Fair enough.\nAllocation of drivers for the heats\nproduced some interesting battles,\nnotably between Lube Boy and The\nGreen Wanker who met, fought,\ncrashed, and fought some more. Lager and Captain FatSlow had some\ninteresting tussles on track, most of\nthem involving Lager pushing from\nbehind (ah yeah), as Captain FatSlow has the biggest arse in the motor club. FatSlow was also involved\nin a heated battle with French Fry\nin a separate heat which saw FatSlow try to punt him off, unsuccess-fully, to the annoyance of most of\nPhDComics\nthe spectators.\nLitres of sweat were produced\nand the waiting room stank of aggression as the draws for the finals\ntook place. After a few hilarious\nstarts in the lower finals, involving\nseveral karts in a space narrower\nthan an amoeba\u2019s arsehole, the\ndraw for the coveted \u2018Final A\u2019 was\nproduced. This had Green Wanker\nstarting from pole after relieving\nhimself earlier, allowing him to\nweigh an impressive three stone,\nclosely followed by Lube Boy, Matt\n2, French Fry, Lager, Captain FatSlow, and Bigot \u2013 most of the usual\nI\u2019m confused, where is the car?\nsuspects.\nThe start of the race was surprisingly clean, with FatSlow losing\ntwo places as he struggled to gain\nacceleration off the line and Lube\nBoy managing to sneak in front of\nthe Green Wanker around the inside of the first corner. The Green\nWanker decided drastic action was\nnecessary to relieve Lube Boy of\nhis understandably slippery situa-tion, and proceeded to smack the\nshit out of him going into Casualty,\nputting both karts a lap down in last\nplace.\nMatt2 snuck into the lead followed by French Fry and Lager,\nwith FatSlow and Bigot closing in\non the third-placed drunk driver.\nOn the second last lap as FatSlow\nwas going to take a stab at Lager,\nBigot decided that now was a good\ntime for a shunt and pushed both\nkarts into the barriers, continuing but pulling the Captain away\nfrom Lager, allowing both karts to\nfall back into the clutches of Lube\nBoy and the Green Wanker who\nwere plugging away to regain time.\nBigot succumbed to Lube Boy after a particularly slick overtaking\nmanoeuvre and was milliseconds\nJohn Sargent\nMotor Club have a day at the races\naway from dispatching Captain\nFatSlow when the flag was waved.\nThe first three drivers (ironically\nnone of the committee, all freshers)\nbeing Matt2, French Fry and Lager\nwho made no mistakes. They were\nawarded with Nuts, Heat, and Hello\nmagazines respectively as well as\nfour-packs of Stella, Carlsberg, and\nSainsbury\u2019s Basics beer \u2013 Lager\nwasn\u2019t terribly impressed.\nIf you ever feel like joining us, the\nkart garage is open on Unwin Road\nin Imperial College behind the\nSkempton building every Wednesday at 1pm.\nApparently riding around in a go kart is considered a sport these days.

This commitment\nnot only applies to new students, but also those\nstudents currently registered on a PhD at Imperial.\nThe issue was \ufb01rst raised by PhD students in the\nDepartment of Mathematics at the end of last term.\nFollowing consultation with student representatives\nin both meetings and an academic forum it was\nresolved that the Union should campaign for all\nstudents, regardless of their funding source, to\nreceive the London weighting. Working with Ben\nHarris, ICU Deputy President (Education and Welfare),\nresearch student representatives Eirini Spencer and\nDaniel Sauder compiled a dossier revealing that the\nmajority of departments within Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences failed to pay all their students the\nLondon weighting.\nThis research was used to produce a presentation\ngiven to the Strategic Education Committee (which\nhas no regular student presence) by Ben Harris\nand John Collins, ICU President. The committee\nunanimously endorsed the proposal put forward by\nProf. Borysiewicz, Imperial College Deputy Rector,\nthat the issue should be taken to the management\nboard with the recommendation that all PhD\nstudents should be paid the London weighting.\nWhat does this mean for students?

    "content": "T\nhe summer may now\nseem like a distant\nmemory but back when\nthe sun shone, coursework deadlines were\nnon-existent and when we could sip\nPimms in the park, without a care\nin the world, the Imperial College\nHockey Club were about to embark\non their summer tour of Ghana.\nA random invitation resulted in\na tour that would be like no other;\n\u201cWould we like to go to Ghana, and\nplay/coach some hockey?\u201d\nBefore we realised what was hap-pening, term had ended, nurses had\ninjected us against most known diseases of the southern hemisphere\nand we were on the plane to Africa\nwondering:\nWhat on earth were we going to\ndo?\nWhy had we trusted Mum with\nthe organisation; she couldn\u2019t even\nmake it off the plane at Amsterdam\nwith her passport?\nWhy, exactly, had we been invited\nto the wedding of a village chief the\nfollowing day?\nThe first couple of days went by\nin a blur, leaving us barely enough\ntime to gain our bearings; a royal\nappointment in a small village in\nthe Volta region (a days travel away\nfrom the airport) and Chief Togbe\nMottey III\u2019s wedding taking up\nmost of those two days. The weekend was a whirl of random road\ntrips, celebrations, dancing and an\neventful midnight trek to Togo (and,\nof course, a fair amount of beer and\ncards), before heading to Accra for\nour first coaching session.\nWe were working closely with the\nNational Hockey Association and\nsome local schools to aid the development and profile of the sport\nin Ghana. Before we left several\npeople had trained as coaches; between us, we planned what we\nhoped to be a useful and fun pro-gramme, though this did nothing\nto suppress nerves before the first\nsession. Everyone did an awesome\njob, proving the nerves were not re-quired, despite the numbers being\nfar higher than we had anticipated.\nThe children\u2019s enthusiasm was so\ngreat that the three hour session\nflew by in drills, frisbee games and\nmini-matches.\nI\u2019m not sure we saw much improvement in the children in the\nfirst session, we hadn\u2019t really\nplanned for them to, but their enjoyment of the sport and willingness to play was encouraging; we\nhad a starting point and could plan\nto move forward. That evening was\nthe World Cup final (yes, I told you\nit was a long time ago!) so we found\na random sports bar with a TV and\nspent the evening explaining to the\nlocals we weren\u2019t French or Italian\neven though we were all wearing\nblue.\n5.30am came all too early the next\nmorning (and every morning that\nweek). It was time for us to venture into the schools and begin the\nreal grass-roots coaching we were\nlooking forward to. We worked in\n5 schools dotted around the Accra\narea; the facilities were varied, with\nmany of the schools never having\nplayed before. What was the best\nthing to do? Give everyone a stick\nand see what happens! It could\nhave been carnage, but with a few\nuseful coaching points passes were\nvaguely in the right direction and,\nby the end of the session, the children were dribbling balls. We were\nkeen to progress the next day, despite some rather school-day-like\nsummons to the headmistresses\u2019\noffices to discuss how the project\nwould be sustained and the future\nof hockey at the various schools.\nThat done, it was time to try and\nnot get lost on the public transport\nsystem and get back to our lodgings\nfor some food and further doses of\nsun-tan cream.\nThe afternoon session was much\nlike the day before, over 100 keen,\nhockey-stick wielding youngsters\non one pitch. They were obviously\nenjoying themselves and we were\nencouraged to see several people\nwho had been part of the school\nsessions earlier that day. The drill\nsergeant, Maria, had them running\neverywhere, while the Hoff was just\na tad too enthusiastic; rumours\nhave it someone chased a poor timid goalkeeper through the market!\nWe followed with a rest and recuperation evening (with a swift\nfine circle) as we enjoyed being in\nthe same place for 2 nights, which\nhadn\u2019t happened in the 5 days we\nhad been in Ghana.\nThe rest of the week followed in a\nsimilar fashion; visiting the vibrant\nand bustling markets, intriguing\ncorners of the city and the odd\nbar (or two). The improvement in\nstandard of play (and our coaching)\nwas immense. Granted we had people falling ill but everyone coped\nand the pitches (or random patches of mud) were filled with champagne hockey skills that would be\na welcome part of our teams here\nin London. After 3 long afternoons\nof negotiations, Mum managed\nto get our kit released from cus-toms; so we were able to present\nthe National Association with 250\nhockey sticks, a goalie kit and 100\nballs (kindly donated by Mercian\nSticking it to them down in Ghana\nIC Hockey looking happy.
