    "content": "Riddley Walker by Russell Hoban, 214\npages, Picador, \u00a31.95.\nThis isn'ta bad book, but it's nowhere near\nas good as the rave reviews all over the cover\nsay it is. It's set in the east of Kent about two\nand a half thousand years in the future after a full-scale nuclear war in 1997. Everyone has\nbeen permanently reduced to a mud hut\nexistence. The hero, Riddley Walker, writes an\naccount of the adventures that happen to him\nover a period of about a week following his\ntwelfth birthday.\nThe author writes that the book is \"written\nnot even in proper English but in a broken-up\nand worn-down vernacular of it.\" This is the\nmost striking feature of the book. Here's a sample:\n\"Being the Big 2 they only done ther 4 shows\na year reg ler plus special Is now and then but\nthey like t to look like Jul time Eusa showmen\nthey k ep ther faces shav it and all. Orfing the\nlitt l1 he carr it the fit up and Goodparely the\nbig 1 he carr it the weapons the same as reg ler Eusa show partners done even tho they cud ve had the he v vy s carry the fit up and the\nweapons and them as we l.\"I don't think it's meant to be a serious\nattempt to predict what an English dialect\nmight be like two thousand years in future but\nit is very effective at establishing an atmosphere. A jarring note in the dialect is the\npresence of technical words like program\n(make a plan) and pir n to wt( printout, meaning\nconclude). They add a futuristic touch that'll\na peal to science fiction fans but it's a gimmick.\nThe story itself contains a strong mystical\nelement that puts the book closer to fantasy\nthan science fiction. The plot concerns events\nwhich are important for the main characters\nbut don't have any significance for the whole\nworld. This isn't quite clear until the end of the\nbook, which makes for an anti-climax, and\nwhen the Punch and Judy show starts on page\n128 the book begins to get silly. All the same\nit's a more imaginative book than most and\nwell worth the initial struggle that's needed to\nmake sense of the language.\nStories (seventeen of them) by Desmond\nHogan, 254 pages, Picador, \u00a31.95.\nPretentious rubbish. Every paragraph is a candidate for Pseuds' Corner, for example:\n\" He came in the summer, left Dublin, city of\nhippies, of Divine Light people, flowers before\nan altar in Santry, oranges before the same\naltar and rhubarb.\" Rhubarb it is.\nN. IViflson\nWhat has 16 million feet, a radius of 14 miles\nand a big nose?\nGive up? It's London (I lied about the nose).\nHave you ever held a warm, voluptuous\nwoman (or man, for 14% of you) in your\narms? No? Neither have I. But if you have,\nthen it probably gives you very little idea as\nto what London is like. Life here, like\nanywhere else, is what you make of it; to\ndifferent people it is different things: the\nproverbial rose or the thorn that lies below\nit. In this series of epic written voyages\n(blockbuster film coming soon) I will try\nand show you places that I enjoy, or would\nenjoy, whenever I visit them.\n- Chelsea\n(To be read in an Alan Wicker style.)\n\"Welcome to one of the most eccentric\nroads in England. In the mid-60s it revelled\nunder the title \"the most hip street in\nLondon\". Come down here any Saturday\nand you'll see why. For this corridor which\nlinks Sloane Street to Parsons Green by\npassing through the area of discussion\nallows some of the most eccentrically\n(some say forlornly) dressed people to taxi\nthrough as they stare at expensive shops,\nrestaurants and, most of all, themselves.\"\nBut equally worthy of comment are the\nparades of very individual shops that line\nit. Let us divide King's Road (for that is\nwhat the A to Z calls it) into three sections,\nthe first running westward from Sloane\nSquare to Chelsea College and the\nChelsea Fire Station, the next continuing\nto that temple of architectural a rao e and\neconomic folly, the World's End, and the\nfinal part running on from there which I do\nnot intend to deal with and suffice it to say\nthat it contains some very extravagant\nantique stores (very compelling study for a lazy Sunday afternoon). No, far more\ninteresting are the first two regions.\nSloane Square itself has many things\nincluding a notable arena of very good,\nmostly exo eri mental pla vs( thanks Mrs\nThompson), i.e. Royal Court Theatre and\nthe only underground station I know with a pub on the platform\u2014the less said about\nthat, the better, I fear. Nevertheless, good\nsense prevails and we may begin our trek\nby musing at one of the John Lewis\narchipelago, the Peter Jones departmental\nstore which houses all kinds of somewhat\nmiddle-class goodies.\nThen we get into what the Kings Road is\nall about\u2014boutiques. No taste in forms of\nattire is spared the ravages of commercial-ism; all kinds of mannequins stand all day,\nall night trying to convince you that you\ntoo may, when so dressed, be equally\ngoodlooking. Heaven forbid such a morbid thought!\nThere are many such emporiums which\nmay well withstand close inspection and,\nindeed, even intrigue one into looking\ninside. The Great Gear Market (just take a peek at this one!), The Chelsea Drugstore\n(No. 49, clothes in the basement, bar on\nthe ground floor and topless gogo dancers and a disco upstairs), The Chelsea\nCobbler (No. 54, booties), and Boy (No.\n153, army gear) reside in the first bit of\nKings Road, while the likes of The DressPound (No. 396, second-hand clothes from\nDior downwards),Tibet House (No. 490a, take a guess), Ace (No. 185, wild ish clothes, diam an teT shirts, expensive), Flip\n(American preppy get-ups), Retro (No.\n229. 30s and 40s clothes) and many, many\nmore tend to fill the other important bit.\nAs with any other major shopping centre, restaurants abound and some of\nthe more notable ones on this road are, in\norder (approximate), The Chelsea Kitchen\n(No. 98, cheap, good), Borscht'n 'Cheers\n(No. 273, Russian and rush in'), The King's Road Jam (No. 289a, extremely, very\ninteresting), Kennedy's( No. 316, good\nhamburger and live rock music), Asterix\n(No. 329, for Real Breton Crepes), and Theirry's( No. 342, nicely romantic).\nInstead of letting my article rampage\nfurther into the wilderness of lists, I will\ntake this opportunity to consider The\nChelsea Antique Market (No. 245a, see the\nFORGET ME NOT stall) and Antiquarius\non the corner of Flood St (where Mrs\nThatcher lived) and King's Road for they\nare both very I think I 've overused most\nsuperlatives.\nChelsea, as you may well be wondering,\nis not just made up of King's Road. To be\nsure (in slight Irish accent) there are many\nmore streets but, with the exception of\nmaybe Fulham Road, they are certainly\nless fulfilling with regard to trade. (They,\nhowever, maintain their very great\naesthetic value and are a pleasure to walk\nalong.)\nFor people with wallets willing to die, I'd point them towards places like The Frock\nExchange (450 Fulham Road), A. Clarke\n(340 Fulham Rd) for second-hand clothes\nand Laura Ashley at 157 Fulham Rd and\ncheaper, slightly imperfect Laura Ashley at\n60 Lower Sloane St, SW1.\nAs nightlife will always be a part of\nstudent life (try taking that away, Maggie)\none could spend time at the Paris Pullman\nCinema (65 Drayton Gdns, 11:00pm every\nnight), the Pan Bookshop (158 Fulham Rd,\nopen till 10:30pm), Midnight Blue (186\nFulham Rd, an expo under of the D. Dirts\ntricks) or may ble try getting an early\nbreakfast from Up All Night (325 Fulham\nRd, closes at 6:00am). And, whatever the\nrest may say, I'd tell you to go to Parson's at 311 Fulham Rd for good hamburgers\nand great waitresses. (If you push this one\na bit, you know do your Imperial bit, I may\nhave a special discount scheme for all of\nyou lovely people.)\nI am sorry that I may have successfully\navoided public houses so far, but you must\nbe considerate. Enjoying yourself may\nmean going to the Six Bells (197 Kings Rd)\nfor a spot of jazz on Monday nights or,\nequally, you may want to try a hand at the\nlunchtime strippers at the Golden Lion\n(490 Fulham Rd, including student\ndiscount). The Cafe des Artistes (266\nFulham Rd) have a nice enough disco\nwhile The Trafalgar (200 Kings Rd) have\njazz sessions sometimes.\nAs a guide this is somewhat disc rim in at ing, but fairly comprehensive. It is not, as it\nmay seem, attempting to go through all the\nshops that may exist in Chelsea, but an\nattempt to get some of you folk off your\nbums and trying to enjoy some of this\nfabled conurbation. I hope it goes some\nway towards helping.\nShezi Abedi\nFELIX, January 15, 1982 Page 11\n\n"

I am\nwriting because I feel that you\ncould not have checked its\nfactual content and I cannot\nlet it go unchallenged. The\nletter concerned the laundry\nin Weeks Hall and was a complete tissue of fabrication,\ncontaining not one truthful\nstatement. In giving the facts\nbehind the current controversy I shall not lower myself\nto the level of this obviously\nextremely unpleasant person\nby being abusive, but will try-to, in spite of my extreme\nannoyance, give the l acts objectively and politely. They\nare as follows.\nThe laundry in the basement of Weeks Hall is provided as part of the facilities\nlor the Hall and is intended to\nhe used by the residents of the\nHall only. Hence the notice to\nthis el fecl on the door which\nhas been there lor at least the\nlast live years. The lock on the\nlaundry door is of the same\ntype as the front door and\nthus will accept the residents\nfront door keys. It also has\nbeen thus for at least the last\nive years. Hence the statement made by your ol lens ive correspondent to the el lect that there was a petty-minded\nconspiracy to lock out Garden\nHall residents is a complete\nlie.\nThere has been no recent\nchanging of locks. The truth is\nvery far from this. Most, if not\nall Weeks residents would be\nhappy to share their laundry\nand were in fact doing so last\nterm when they heard of the\nmisfortune of Garden Hall\nwhose washing machine had\nbroken down. This happy\nsituation would doubtless\nhave continued if it were not\nfor the totally unreasonable\nbehaviour of seemingly a great number ol Garden Hall\nresidents. Towards the end ol\nlast term large numbers of\nthem would take over the\nlaundry for very long periods\nof time intimidating the\nrightful users by their aggressive and uncivil attitude and\npreventing their access.\nAdditionally, a tumble driver was broken by putting\na large amount ol soap powder in it, the ironing board was burnt several times. Weeks Hall residents\nhad their washing removed\nfrom the driers be lore it was\ndry and the laundry was left\nvery untidy with litter and\nsoap powder strewn across the\nfloor.\nIt should be noted here\nthat if this was how Garden\nHall residents treated their\nown laundry then it is not\nsurprising that it has broken\ndown.\nConcerning your correspondent's assertion that it was\nofficial policy to lock out\nGarden Hall residents this is\nmost certainly not the case.\nBut who can blame the\nindividual Weeks Hall student who chooses to protect\nhis washing whilst he is away\nby locking the door.'\nII Garden Hall residents\nwould like to use Weeks Hall\nlal tn dry this year t hen I would suggest that they write\nto Weeks Hall Committee a polo gi sing for their disgrace-fu I be ha vi our last term. offering to reimburse Weeks\nHall lor the damage they\nperpetrated and asking permission to use the laundry\nsparingly and at off-peak\ntimes for which they would be\nprepared to make a contribution to the maintenance costs.\n) burs ill\nAndrew Lyall\nWeeks Hall resident\n,S \u00bb,\nStan Kearns, former Southside and Holland Club bar\nmanager has now retired and\nMr Morton tells us that tin-poor chap is very ill. As a result of this Mr Morton proposed Mr Kearns for\nHonorary Life Membership\nof IC Union at Council last\nterm. He felt it would be a nice gesture.\nWriting as an irate Honorary Life Member of the\nUnion, I feel it is an insult to\nmy sell and other life members\nlor such a person to be\nnominated by the President.\nAt best Mr Kearns was\nsex tre mcl v nasty, at worst,\nextremely extremely nasty,\ncontinually intoxicated on\nduty and on one occasion told\nan elderly lady to \" Fuck off,\nyou old cow\". My mother\nwasn't at all impressed.\nOn the Bar Committee last\nyear, Mr Morton expressed\nloud unfavourable opinions\nconcerning Mr Kearns and\nhis poor handling of the\nSouthside Bar.

At least, it should traditionally\nbe a thirteen foot pole, uniform in diameter,\nand cylindrical in shape; but nowadays many\ntoss ers prefer a shorter length, and so each\nc aber is 'perforated' by partly sawing it\nthrough; in this way the competitors, by\nbreaking the c aber at an appropriate perforation (or perforations) can shorten it\nfrom its original thirteen feet to any whole\nnumber of feet less than thirteen. But sawing\nthrough ac aber weakens it, and so to reduce\nthe possibility of injuring Billy Connolly for life\n(or to increase the possibility, depending on\nhow violently you play) the number of\nperforations is kept to a minimum. Angus has\nbeen passing the time between tosses by\nworking out where along its length the pole\nshould be perforated.

    "content": "*7&eat*e The Mayor of Zalamea by Pedro Calderon\nde la Barca in a version by Adrian Mitchell. Directed by Michael Bogdanov.\nThe Olivier, National Theatre.\nIn August 1580, troops were massing in\nZalamea, a small Spanish town, for what was\nto become a successful assault on Portugal.\nThis was the Spain of Philip II where Holy\nWars brought about the conquest of vast\ndomains. These historical facts form the\nbackground of the play The Mayor of Zalamea\nby Calderon, the great 17th Century Spanish\nplaywright who still remains one of Spain's greatest dramatists (the other being Lope de\nVega). In some respects he is akin to our own\nShakespeare. Calderon himself was incredibly\nversatile: he was a dramatist of superb wit and\nintellect, a magnificent swordsman who fought\nmany duels, an accomplished pursuer of\nwomen and, finally in life, a priest. His plays\nwere prolific in number and extraordinary in\nvariety. He wrote tragedies and histories,\ncomedies of manners, mythological plays and\ndramas of chivalry and philosophy.\nThe troops are given shelter in Zalamea by a farmer, a man of principle and honour. But no\nsooner does the rough brigade enter the town\nwhen the captain is determined to lay his\nhands on the beautiful farmer's daughter. His\ndetermination allows nothing to stand in his\nway and as may be feared he succeeds in\nattaining a girl only by raping her. Spaniards at\nthe time of the play and of the events upon\nwhich the play is based were especially\nsensitive in matters of honour. Honour in the\nform of virginity is the keynote of The Mayor\nThe Oresteia. The trilogy by Aeschylus in\na version by Tony Harrison. Directed by\nPeter Hall and music by Harrison Birtwistle. The Olivier, National Theatre.\nThe National Theatre production of the\nOresteia is a rare and long awaited event.\nFrom the Land of Aeschylus( b.525BC), founder of European theatre, it is one of the\nmost powerful works in all drama. The play\ntells in three successive parts an epic story of\nblood-guilt, ven gence and reconciliation, and\nconcerns the gods of the House of Atreus.\nAgamemnon returns to Argos after conquering\nTroy and is killed by his wife Clytemnestra.\nGoaded by Apollo to avenge his murdered\nfather. Orestes kills Clytemnestra. The Furies\nthreaten him and he goes to seek Apollo's help. The God promises protection and sends\nhim to seek justice from Athena, which he\nDuel from the Mayor of Zalamea.\nof Zalamea. In fact El Honor lies at the core of\nmuch of the Spanish Golden Age drama. The\nculprit is brought to trial by the newly-elected\nMayor of the town who ironically turns out to\nbe the victim's father.\nCompleting the narration of events would\nnot only spoil potential enjoyment but would\nalso oversimplify or even belittle the play. It is a great masterpiece that has been acted continuously in Spain since it was written in\nabout 1644. The timelessness of the play and\nthe reasons why it will continue to delight\naudiences for many generations to come lie in\nits masterful blend of contrasts. It is at once a eventually attains to the annoyance of the\nFuries.\nIn keeping with the ancient tradition, the\nentire cast in the production use masks, and\nthis forces nearly all one's attention on the\ndialogue. The masks certainly remind me how\nimportant facial expression is in drama. The\ndialogue is poetic, relentless in dramatic\nintensity and somewhat monotonous in tone,\nand starting at 5:00pm the play certainly\ndemands a lot from trie audience. The accompanying music provided by percussion,\nwind and harp is simple and imaginative and\nprovides added poignancy to moments of\ndrama. The Olivier's auditorium complements\nthe work marvellously. The fan-shaped theatre\nwith open stage and banked seats are based\non the ancient amphitheatres where the great\nGreek dramas were once performed.\nsuperb comedy but yet a tragedy. Tender love\nscenes give way to bitter sword fights.\nBeautiful Spanish tunes rendered on the guitar\ncontrast with the brutal, naked sound of the\ncannon, and all human types from the King of\nSpain to the common tart make an appearance\nin the play. A very strong cast is headed by\nDaniel Massey and Michael Bryant who both\ngive outstanding performances. This is the first\nproduction to be transferred from the National\nTheatre's small Cottesloe Theatre to the\nOlivier, and this surely demonstrates its wide\nappeal. This is a play that I cannot recommend\ntoo highly.\nA modern audience seeing The Oresteia\nlargely lacks, of course, the shared culture\nwhich was familiar to all who witnessed\nperformances in the Fifth Century BC. In his\nplays, Aeschylus reflected the issues of his\nown day as well as drawing on legends known\nto all his contemporaries such as the epic\npoems of Homer. The legends made up a pretty comprehensive history of the world as\nthe ancient Greeks knew it. To Harrison, the\ndirector of the play, the main social factor\nmotivating the tensions and the apparent\nresolution of The Oresteia was what Friedrich\nEngels called \"the historical defeat of the\nfemale sex\"; the transition from the old world\nof matriarchy to the new world of male\ndomination, female subjection and property\nrights assured by inheritance in the male line.\nIn the time of Aeschylus, Athenian women\nwere unfree. \"The best reputation a woman\ncan have is not to be spoken of among men,\neither for good or for evil\" claimed Pericles, and\n\"by nature the male is superior, the woman\ninferior; therefore the man rules and the\nwoman is ruled\" stated Aristotle. It is said that\nthe figure of Clytemnestra in The Oresteia\nprobably resembles what many men today fear\nwill be the ultimate result of women's liberation; a terrifying figure capable of taking\nher husband's life in her hands. \"The new\nworld,\" says Harrison, \"the world of Zeus and\nApollo, has continued unbroken and almost\nunchanged until our own time. Now however it\nfaces a challenge from radical feminism. And\nthe insights that have emerged from that\nmovement are crucial to our understanding of\nThe Oresteia and the conflicts Aeschylus\nportrayed in it.\"\nNick Bedding\nMasked players in Oresteia.\nPage 10 FELIX, January 15, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Students\nTo those of us who work here the Student\nServices Office seems remarkably like the\ncentre of the universe, so it always comes\nas a rather nasty shock when, in moments\nof casual conversation with a student or\nmember of staff in another part of College,\nwe are met with blank expressions and\nremarks like \"where's that?\" or \"what do\nyou do there?\", when we happen to\nmention where we come from or what we\ndo. Admittedly we have only been in\nexistence (in our present place and\nstructure) for one year, so to make the\nevent and spread the news a little further\nhere again is a brief rundown of our\nvarious activities.\n. College Accommodation\nApplication and billing for all the College\naccommodation allocated to students\nbegins with us, including a limited number\nof flats for families.\nPrivate Sector\nThere are quite a number of landlords and\nlandladies in West London who now\ncontact us rather than other agencies\nwhen their flats or beds its become available, while we attract new sources of\naccommodation through advertisements\nin London newspapers at regular intervals.\nThis means that we always have some\ncurrent information on vacancies throughout the year with an extra effort to gain\nmore places at the beginning of the\nacademic year and each new term. If we\ncannot provide you with the type of\naccommodation you are looking for an\nAccommodation Guide may be of use with\na list of agencies and legal and practical ad-vice.\nServiced\nLegal Advice\nThis includes all kinds of legal problems\nfrom traffic offences to making claims\nunder the small claims procedure in the\ncounty court.\nIn certain cases where you may have to\nhave a solicitor, as for example, you would\nif you wanted someone to represent you in\na magistrates court, we have lists of\nsolicitors who do legal aid work\u2014which is\nfree if your income is low enough \u2014\ntogether with the areas of the law that they\nspecialise in. These lists also note solicitors who speak languages other than\nEnglish.\nLandlord Problems\nThese can be many and varied. One of the\nproblems is knowing just what your rights\nare. Other problems, such as an imminent\nbreakdown in the relationship between\ntenant and landlord, may be helped through an intermediary such as ourselves.\nConsumer Rights\nLegislation over the last few years has\ngiven the consumer considerable pro-tec tion. However, it is still up to the\nindividual to find out how he stands in any\ntransaction that appears to have gone\nwrong, and summon up enough energy to\ncommence battle! This is where we can\nprovide reinforcements with advice and\nsometimes direct intervention when\nappropriate.\nImmigration/Home Office Problems\nThis is an area which may require the skills\nof specialist organisations or solicitors\nwhich we can put you in touch with\nalthough for routine enquiries we should\nbe able to provide most of the answers.\nA fairy's assistant\ntells all\nInsurance\nWe have quite a selection of leaflets on\nmany types of insurance, including bicycles, possessions and holidays. We\nmay also be able to help sort out problems\nconcerning claims.\nCovenants\nHere is a useful way of supplementing your\nincome by reclaiming tax paid by your\nparents on their contribution to your grant.\nForms explaining the procedure are\navailable from Student Services.\nBenefits\nWe have most of the Department of Health\nand Social Security leaflets relevant to\nstudents, such as those on all aspects of\nthe NHS, unemployment benefit, supplementary benefit, and social security agreements with the EEC and other\ncountries. Our own information sheet also\nexplains the rent allowance and rebate\nschemes.\nGrants\nHelp with chasing up recalcitrant LEAs,\nadvice on eligibility for grants, details of\ncertain discretionary allowances and lists\nof educational charities can be provided.\nMiscellaneous\nThis includes such things as reference\nbooks on holiday jobs and working holidays, while we also aim to act as\nintermediaries between those looking for\ntutoring work and those in need of\ntutoring.\nIf there's anything else you need information on topics not mentioned here,\ncome and see us in the Student Services\nOffice. If we can't help, there's always our\nbook of useful phone numbers.\nSue Telling\nSmall Ads\n\u2022 TODAY in Che mEng Theatre 1 at 1:00pm Industrial Society presents\nThe Chips Are Down A view of the effects of microcomputers on industrial employment\nwith the West London representative of\nASTM S.

This week:\nCharles Darwin\nand Creationists\nby Frank James\nThis year witnesses the centenary of the death\nof one of Britain's greatest scientists \u2014\nCharles Darwin. Unfortunately this coincides\nwith the rise of an opposition to Darwinism\nfrom those who term themselves 'creationists'.\nI will discuss their motivation for holding this\nbelief later. The kern al of their opinions, so far\nas the development of life is concerned, is that\nall the species of plant and animal life were\nformed by acts of special creation during the\npast six thousand years. (An Irish Archbishop\n'calculated' this value of the age of the earth in\nthe seventeenth century). Fossils are\nexplained as the remains of animals killed off\nduring the universal flood.\nSo far as I am concerned people are free to\nbelieve such myths or not as they please (there\nare still flat-earth ers after all). But 1 strongly\nobject to people holding such beliefs attempting to force such contentions down\nother people's throats in the name of truth and\nscience. They quite seriously believe, and misuse modern philosophical arguments to justify\nthis belief, that creationism has the same\ntheoretical status as Natural Selection. They\nfurther say that they have the same institutional structure as modern science. And\nthat among their adherents there are several\ndoctorates in biology. On closer examination\nthe degree awarding bodies of most of the sr people are universities in the southern United\nStates \u2014 the sort of institutions from which\nIan Paisley 'gained' his doctorate.\nNow all this is pure propaganda on the part\nof the creationists to spread their point of view\nin the educational system and to gain\nrespectability. If we let their views predominate\nand do no! use reason to show that their views\nare absurd then there is the possibility that\ntheir views might spread in this country as they\nhave already done in the United States.\nThe creationists appear to be dissatisfied\nwith a materialistic account of the development\nof man. Yet what can science do but discuss\nthe nature of the material world? To advance\ntheories which in their very nature cannot be\nsubstantiated by any direct material evidence\nis unscientific to say the least. On the other\nhand Darwinism does account for the\nevolution of life and also for the evidence\nwithout any need to impose convoluted interpretations or resort to non-scientific\narguments.\nWhat is the motive of these people? The\nonly answer I can find is power. By setting up a system for the development of life which is not\ndependent on chance, and which within itself is\nlogically coherent (Alice Through the Looking\nClass is incidentally logically coherent given\nthe initial postulates), the creationists argue\nthat this will lead to a secure society. They\ncannot tolerate a pluralistic society in which\npeople can do as they please. They want to\nenforce a system of belief on others from\nwhich no deviation is permitted and thus\nensure their control over society.\nThey ignore the evolutionary fact that man\nis an animal and should be proud to be so. It is\nafter all by pure chance that any of us are here\nat all, and I do not see what is so very odd in\naccepting that our species is also here by\nchance. If Darwin knew that there were still\ncreationists in existence 100 years after his\ndeath he would be spinning in his grave in\nWestminster Abbey.\nBAii\nTHE\nDon't worry dear, one ol these days\nMr Left is sure to come along.\nLady Flowers and the IC Wives Club invite you to a FREE BEER AND\nBANGERS in the Rector's Pad (170 Queensgate) on Tues Jan 26, from\n5:30 to 7pm.

Southside wardens insist on\nDr Paul Jowitt, pictured in a FELIX from 1973 when he\nwas responsible for the\nprovision of a room for the\nstudent welfare service at\nthe top of Union Building.\nhard route to the top\nThe penthouse flats above the Southside Hails of\nResidence have now been filled, after lying empty for a term. However, the new residents are not to be allowed\naccess to their accommodation by the lifts of the\npenthouse level, but have agreed to use the Tizard/Selkirk\ngallery level and stairs as their means of entry.\nThe condition that the residents could not use the lilt to\nthe penthouse level was made\nquite clear to the applicants,\nand those who were successful\nhave, not un surprisingly agreed to this and other terms. Whilst not disputing\nthat the condition has been\nfully accepted, FELIX feels\nthat the move is totally unnecessary and is a further\nexample of the pettiness which has surrounded the\nwhole question of the Southside penthouse Oats.\nLast term the Hats were left\nempty, primarily due to the\nfact that Dr Paul Jo witt. Falmouth Keo gh Warden was 11 ving in onew hi1e another, larger flat was being\ndecorated for his use. It\nappears that the condition of\nthe second Hat was not good\nenough for him (although it\nwas lor the previous occupant.\nDr Frank Potter). This lost\nthe College revenues of the\norder of ^2,000.\nNow we see a In rt her example of this short-sighted\nattitude. The students living\nin the flats are not being\nallowed to use the lifts provided because it will disturb the privacy of the\nwardens. Surely this is an\nexample of the \" we don't want a black living next\ndoor\" prejudice mentality\nbeing applied to a group of\nstudents.\nIt is such a shame that Dr Jowitt above all, who is a former student and DeputyP resident of the Union, should be so petty. He apparently did a lot of work for\nstudents and would probably\nhave been writing an article\nlike this himself eight or so\nyears ago.\nSo cut the pettiness and\nreverse this decision, Southside wardens.

Onboard experiments from which we hope to be\nable to collect data, include radiation detectors\nfor the investigation of aurora l displays and a magneto meter allowing the detection of\ngeo magnetic storms. The CCD camera\nimaging system promises to be the most\ninteresting (and most comprehensible!) though\nas this relays pictures of weather patterns on\nearth. However, before we can receive and\nuse any of this, we need to build up the\nrelevant circuitry. We have the components,\nwe have the circuit diagrams, we even have\nsoldering irons, and, yes, solder\u2014but is there\nanyone out there fancies wielding a soldering iron? The more the merrier of course\ncome to any one of our meetings (Tuesdays,\nPhysics LT2, 6:30pm, or alternatively contact\nGary Fuller in Physics 3).\nCND\nAudiosoc\nIs it true, has the Chairman of the Audio\nSociety defected, only being able to print small\nads in this so-called magazine? Is he exiled to\nreside permanently in Chelsea? Does Jo of 84\nGranville Rd SW18 really have a decent\nsystem? Is she still going to keep her promise\nof taking me out for a meal? The answers to\nthese questions (and more) are no, no, very\nyes(!) and 'I don't know, why don't you ask\nher?1\n.\nI may have been quiet, but certainly not\ndead. I have been scheming, planning and now\nI bring you not just one but two major\nlectures. No, you're not hallucinating, this is\nactually happening.\nJ. Scott Strachan, eminent engineer and\ndesigner of the world famed Syrinx PU1 and 2\ntone arms will, in the Quiet Room, QR002,\nSherfield Building this evening at 6:30pm deliver a lecture and demonstrate equipment\n(at the same time as downing a pint) on the\nsubject of 'Tonearm and Turntable Design'\n(Hear it like it is folks, from the pros.)\nThe second lecture will be in the same place,\nQR002 at 6:30pm on Wednesday, February 3\nand this time Mr Mike Daniels will eup he misc on the sales directions of audio companies.\nMike Daniels is one of the sales managers of\nDW Labs, the company that bring you such\ngoodies as the Gale loudspeakers and the\nCarver Cube magnetic amplifier and Mr\nDaniels will also be demonstrating this\nequipment. What a great man! Come along\nand bring a friend and an open mind.\nThe IC European Nuclear Disarmament groups has arranged, through the Humanities\nDept, an excellent series of lectures for this\nterm under the title \"Nuclear War in Europe?\"\nCritical decisions are going to be made over\nthe next few years on which not only our\ndefence but also our very survival will depend.\nCan you afford not to listen to the arguments\nfrom both sides which will be presented this\nterm? Unless you plan to live for the rest of\nyour life with your head in the sand you will\nfinally have to confront and take a stand on\nthese issues\u2014and this lecture series could be a fine place to start.\nAll of the talks will be given in Physics LT1. The full list is:\nTuesday, January 19 \"Nuclear Weapons in\nEurope\", Field Marshal the Lord Carver.\nTuesday, January 26 \"The Soviet 'Threat'\nand British Defence Policy\", Professor Robert\nNeild.\nTuesday, February 2 \" UK Defence\u2014The\nNeutrality Option\", Alan Clark, Tory MP for\nPlymouth Sutton.\nTuesday, February 9 \"Nuclear Deterrence\u2014\nFact or Fiction\" A debate between Lord Chalfont and Professor Michael Pentz.\nDancing\nOn November 28 IC Dancing Club hosted all\nthe other London University Dancing Clubs\n(and Cambridge) at the London Ball\u2014a series\nof friendly competitions, some in a lighter vein\nthan others, interspersed with general dancing and a display by two professional\nLatin-American dancers. The event was highly\nsuccessful, and the J CR was packed for the\nwhole of a very enjoyable evening.\nThe Dancing Club Dinner & Dance two\nweeks later also proved to be a good night\nout\u2014having eaten our fill, we danced to a live\nband until the small hours.\nNow that some of you have missed two of\nthe best social events of the academic year,\nwe're going to give you yet another opportunity\nto learn how to put one foot in front of another\nwithout treading on someone else's toes\u2014not\nquite as easy as it sounds when you're on a crowded dance floor.\nOn Tuesday, January 19, at 7:30pm in the\nJ CR, we are starting another beginners' class\nin ballroom and Latin American dancing.\nHopefully by March 5 all of those who have\nbeen brave enough to take their first faltering\nsteps will have the chance to represent IC at\nthe Inter-Varsity Dancing Competition in the\n\"Off Beat\" event\u2014a team effort which we\nusually do well in.\nWhether you just want to learn a social skill,\nor whether you intend to be the best thing\nsince sliced bread, you' ve got to start\nsomewhere\u2014so how about investing 40p in\nIV2 hours professional tuition by coming along\nto the lesson on Jan 19.\n(NB: We now also have an Intermediate\nClass at 7:30pm in the J CR on Wednesdays).\nHamsoc\nFed up with CB? Bored with IC Radio? Why\nnot get onto the airwaves with amateur radio.\nThis term Hamsoc will be running a series of\nlectures for those of you wishing to pass the\nRadio Amateurs Exam, an essential requirement for an amateur licence.\nTo start things off there'll be a talk just giving\nan introduction to what's involved in taking the\nexam and what you'll be able to do once you\nhave a licence, there'll also be a demonstration\nof some typical equipment as well, so if you're\ninterested come along to Rm1207 Elec Eng on\nWednesday, January20 at 1:00pm. More details are available from Julian Cooch, Ext\n3000 or Michael Bull, Ext 3035.\nDebsoc\nOn Thursday, January 21, there will be a lunchtime debate on the Socialism versus\nCaptialism theme featuring speakers from IC\nConservative Society and the Socialist Party of\nGreat Britain. Further details will appear in the\npre-debate publicity. If you would like to join\nthe Debating Society contact Der mot McCauley or Chris Lee via Maths letter racks \u2014we only bite when angry.\nSF Soc\nIt was January 15 1982, but for four and a half\nbillion people it would soon be January 18 1982,\nand people would flock to Me ch Eng 220 to see\nTime After Time, a spiff ing comedy thriller in\nwhich H.G. Wells pursues Jack the Ripper into\n1979, starring David Warner, Malcolm McDowell and Mary Steenburgen, with a few\nlaughs and a bit of blood. Recommended.\nI trust you were all aghast at what the Beeb\ndid to 2001-A Space Odyssey, that other\nslighly more famous comedy thriller. I know I was. Notice to rich film fans: tomorrow the\nScala is showing the Star Trek blooper real\nThose who do not understand that would not\nbe interested. Notice to book fans: Timescope\nand Riddiey Walker out in paperback. Notice\nto SF Soc bulletin fans: author out to lunch.\nBut where have all the jokes gone? Is it the\nweather? The FT Index? The Editor? The\nsinister little men I see out of the corners of my\neyes who vanish when I look at them? Or\nperhaps I dreamt it all. No, something must\nhave happened to give me the vivid nightmares\nwhich make me wake up screaming the lyrics\nof Dancing Cheek to Cheek. Who has\nkidnapped all the inspectors on the under-ground? What really happened to Ambrose\nBierce? How should I know?\nRobert Blake and his Batrachian Rhythm\nBoys\nJ. Scott Strachan, designer of the Syrinx PU1 and 2 arms\nQuiet Room, QR002,\nSherfield Building.\nPage 8 FELIX, January 15, 1982\n\n"
