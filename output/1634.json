Photo Credit: ANOHNI\nCale Tilford\nMusic and Games Editor\nThe protest album of the decade\nANOHNI\u2019s solo debut album is an unhinged attack on the status quo\nH\nope was the word that\ncame to represent\nObama\u2019s presidential\ncampaign back in\n2008. For a few brief moments the\nworld \u2013 inspired by Shepard Fairey\u2019s\niconic poster \u2013 genuinely believed\nthat change might finally come to\nneoliberal America. After eight\nyears in office, Obama has grown\nold and the energy that once defined\nhim has dissipated,along with many\nof his promises. ANOHNI\u2019s debut\nsolo album Hopelessness is not kind\nto America and Obama. It presents\nthe obvious truths and struggles that\nhave defined the politics of the 21st\nCentury: the rise of drone warfare,\nthe defeat of environmentalism,\nmass-surveillance, and the\nhypocritical attitude of Western\nnations. It is always direct; nothing\nis ever held back or hidden under\nmultiple layers of meaning. The\nresult is a beautifully modern and\naccessible experimental protest\nrecord.\nCo-produced by both Ross\nBirchard (Hudson Mohawke) and\nDaniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point\nNever), the album is often dark and\nbrooding,complementing its serious\nsubject matter. At other times, the\ntone is more upbeat \u2013 emulating\npop songs to reflect the glorification\nof death and justice in some parts of\nAmerican society. On \u2018Execution\u2019,\nANOHNI sings \u201cExecution / It\u2019s\nan American dream,\u201d with the\nformer delivered so enthusiastically\nthat it sounds like a celebration.\nThis song, like many others on the\nalbum, is draped in irony. In a more\nhushed voice ANOHNI reminds us\nof the hypocrisy of America. \u201cLike\nthe Chinese and the Saudis / The\nNorth Koreans and the Nigerians,\u201d\nAmerica is one of the few nations\nthat still has the death penalty.\nOn the back of her Academy\nAward nomination this year for\nBest Original Song \u2018Manta Ray\u2019 \u2013\na song about biodiversity and the\ndestruction of nature \u2013 ANOHNI\nreflects further on the environment\nduring the album\u2019s lead single \u20184\nDegrees\u2019.Likemuchofthealbum,on\n\u20184 Degrees\u2019 performs as an alter-ego\nof sorts; this character contradicts\ndrone bomb.\u201d From this perspective\nshe exclaims \u201cDrone bomb me /\nBlow me from the mountains / And\ninto the sea.\u201d Looking at the choice\nof themes reflected on throughout\nthe album, this is more than just a\ncriticism of America \u2013 it is aimed at\nObama himself.\nDrone bombing is one of the\nmany things that has increased in\nfrequency under his administration.\nAnother high profile issue that\ncomes up \u2013 brought to light in\n2013 by Edward Snowden \u2013 is\nthe NSA\u2019s mass surveillance of\nAmerican citizens. \u2018Watch Me\u2019 is a\nconversation with an NSA agent:\n\u201cI know you love me / \u2018Cause you\u2019re\nalways watching me.\u201d ANOHNI\ncriticises a system that suggests\nit is trying to protect us from evil,\nterrorism and child molesters (this\nis her list, not mine) but is based on\nthe assumption we are all guilty.\nreflecting the prophet-like status\nObama secured in his initial\ncampaign for president: \u201cWhen\nyou were elected / The world cried\nfor joy.\u201d But now he is \u201cPunishing\nthe whistleblowers / Those who\ntell the truth\u201d \u2013 a stark contrast to\nhis promise of a new politics and\nradical change.\nThe final two tracks offer little\nhope.They paint a picture of a planet\ndestroyed by over-consumption.\nEven ANOHNI admits \u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen taking more than I deserve.\u201d\n\u2018Marrow\u2019, the album\u2019s closer is a\nmetaphor for America\u2019s exploitation\nof the world\u2019s resources and\ngovernments; it has unashamedly\nextracted and injected. There is no\nhope: \u201cWe are, we are all Americans\nnow.\u201d\nHopelessness by ANOHNI is out\nnow on Rough Trade\ntemperature by the end of the\ncentury (if no actions are taken), she\nsings: \u201cIt\u2019s only 4 degrees, it\u2019s only 4\ndegrees / I wanna see this world, I\nwanna see it boil.\u201d While this is an\nobvious attack on her government,\nit is possible she is also examining\nher own attitude to the environment\nand her lack of action.This theme of\nhopelessness and inability to force\nchange throughout the world runs\nthrough the album.\nThe message of \u2018I Don\u2019t Love You\nAnymore\u2019, in contrast to rest of the\nalbum, is far less obvious: \u201cYou left\nme in a broken world / You left me\nlying in the street / You left me\nwithout body heat.\u201d It seems more\nlike an attack on the general system\nof capitalism (that America exports\nglobally) than an attack on a specific\nsection of American oppression.\n\u2018Drone Bomb Me\u2019 focuses on\ndrone warfare and the West\u2019s acts\nof terror throughout the world.\nANOHNI describes it as \u201ca love\nsong from the perspective of a girl in\nAfghanistan\u2026looking up at the sky\nand she\u2019s gotten herself to a place\nwhere she just wants to be killed by a\nIt is always\ndirect;\nnothing is\never held\nback or\nhidden\nunder\nmultiple\nlayers of\nmeaning\nThis is more\nthan just a\ncriticism of\nAmerica \u2013\nit is aimed\nat Obama\nhimself\nThe most open attack on Obama\nis on the track named after him.\nIt is delivered like a call to prayer,\nher own opinions but does so in a\nmanner which is blatantly sarcastic,\nbut could easily be mistaken for\nthe establishment.

Only 10 groups progress\nto the final on Broadway in New\nYork,and last weekend,representing\nImperial and the whole of the UK,\nwe were one of those teams.\nThe journey for us started back\nin March 2015, when the then-current, and future MDs, Alex\nMoore and Ehsaan Shivarani,\nstarted trying out arrangements,\ndiscussing what songs to pick for\nnext year\u2019s competition. In short,\neach team has 12 minutes to present\ntheir wares, doing whatever they\nwant. Soon, a set of all British songs\nhad emerged, and we were ready\nto rehearse them. Roshani Abbey,\na fellow a cappella and musical\ntheatre enthusiast, joined our crew\nshortly after starting rehearsals for\nbits of our 4-song set.\nIn February and March, the\ncompetition rounds began. We\npassed our way through the quarter-finals, and earned our place in the\nsemi-finals in London. It came as\na complete surprise when we beat\noff all other UK groups, and got the\nchance to compete on Broadway.\nGetting there would be no easy\nfeat \u2013 with an August Edinburgh\nfringe show already paid for, we\nwould have to raise another \u00a36k to\nget flights to New York. Not only\nthat,but the finals would occur right\nin the middle of exams for most\nof our members. Regardless, the\ngroup persisted, even through one\nmember\u2019s glandular fever a week\nbefore the competition (wrecking\nhis singing voice), and flew out on\nFriday evening, landing shortly\nbefore midnight in JFK airport.\nThe first night, in \u201csomething of\na murder motel\u201d was surprisingly\npleasant, managing to bag a\nfree breakfast the next morning.\nWith a troublesome journey into\nThe lowdown on theTechtonics win\nManhattan from the motel, we\nbarely made the theatre in time for\nthe intro brief before soundchecks.\nWith our speedy 20 minute\nsoundcheck done, we spent the rest\nof the day absorbing what we could\nof the beautiful New York scenery,\nincluding a warm up in nearby\nCentral Park, before heading back\nto the theatre. Disaster struck when\n3 of our members, bass, beatbox and\na soloist, got stuck in the elevator\non their way to the green rooms\none hour before we were to open\nthe show. Seconds after the call was\nmade that The Techtonics should be\nmoved to a later slot, the trapped\nsingers emerged, and suddenly it\nwas all go. 15 minutes later, we were\nready in the wings,about to sing our\nhearts out for the last time.\nI\u2019ll be honest, trying to describe\nthe experience of the performance\nsuccinctly completely evade me.\nOpening the last round of a\nhuge competition to a sell-out,\n2800-strong, a cappella-frenzied\naudience was one of the experiences\nI will count as the best in my life.\nTo put things in perspective, the\nBeacon Theatre is larger than every\nsingle theatre in London. And the\nwhole audience was whooping and\nscreaming like only an American\ncrowd can.\nThe next 4 songs went by in a\nblur, with my recollection of the\nThe whole\naudience\nwas\nwhooping\nand\nscreaming\nMadeon intro jumping to Queen\u2019s\nBicycle Race, then Sam Smith\u2019s Lay\nMe Down, and finally to The Beatles\nI Saw Her Standing There only\nexisting because I had practiced it\nhundreds of times and knew each\nchord progression like the back of\nmy hand. I remember snippets of\na quick debrief in our green room\nfollowing our breathless exit from\nthe stage, with some well-wishes\nto the other groups occurring\nsomewhere in between.\nI won\u2019t bore you with the details\nof the other sets from the US\ngroups, suffice to say they were\nslick and impressive, all of them.\nwhen we returned to the stage for\nthe announcement, we were met\nwith cheering, applause, and general\nelation that defied belief. The huge\ntrophy, and with it, the international\nchampionship of collegiate a\ncappella, was ours.\nSince then,it has been a whirlwind\nof activity. We were invited to go\non the radio the next morning,\nand have had endless tweets, some\nfrom producers and actors (Skylar\nAstin, \u2018Jessie\u2019 from Pitch Perfect!),\nand trying to get the trophy back\nhome on the flight was a nightmare.\nHopefully it will be on display\nsomewhere in college soon. We\u2019re\nproud that for the first time in the\ncompetition\u2019s history, we\u2019ve brought\nthe win back to the UK.\nLook at these cuties and their giant trophy Photo Credit: Joe Martinez\nWill O\u2019Reilly\nWriter\nCapturing the moment of Ehsaan\u2019s incredible solo Photo Credit: Joe Martinez\nA Cappella catch us up on their victory in New York\nO\nne of my favourite\nthings about playing\nthe French horn is\nthat you get called\nin to play in concerts at the last\nminute pretty often. At Imperial\nthe concerts usually tend to end up\nbeing actually really good and so\nit\u2019s always quite exciting to get the\nopportunity to play with groups\nhere. Last week I got to play in\nthe ICSM Music Society Concert\nand it basically lived up to all my\nhopes for a concert and massively\nsurpassed my expectations for a\nnight that the only details I\u2019d really\nbeen given beforehand were \u2018turn\nup for rehearsal at 4.30,St Stephen\u2019s\nChurch\u2019.\nThe ICSM Music Society\nConcert is a really special event that\nhas all five of the ensembles under\nthe ICSM Music umbrella (Choir,\nChamber Choir, Orchestra, Jazz\nBand and Bands) come together\nto perform under the same roof.\nWith exams and deadlines a\nserious looming threat through any\nSummer term, each ensemble only\nhad an allocated two rehearsals for\nthe concert but had clearly worked\nhard to produce the standard of\nmusic the night saw.\nThe night started with four pieces\nICSM Music Society Concert\nby Jazz Band, which included\ntruly incredible solos from Auriol\nHarford and Joseph Derry. Choir\nthen took the stage for a song from\nthe musical Oh Kay! and a beautiful\nspiritual Ezekiel Saw De Wheel. The\nfirst half then finished with four\npieces from the Bands,one of which\nwas written by Music societies own\nBen Lau, called \u2018Shine On\u2019 and\ncertainly went a long way to proving\nthat Imperial has students that are\nphenomenal at way more than just\ntheir degrees!\nThe second half started with two\nsongs from Chamber choir, one was\na piece by Olga Gjielo inspired by\nthe aurora borealis and performed\njust as beautifully. The other was a\njolly English madigral that picked\nthe mood in the room right up\nready for Choir to return to the\nstage to sing Aerosmith\u2019s \u2018I don\u2019t\nwant to miss a thing\u2019, arranged by\nDominic Lagrue as a thank you for\nthe effort and joy the group showed\nin choir all year.\nAfter a brief pause to get orchestra\nset up, the Orchestra performed\na Rimsky Korsakov \u2018Fantasy on\nSerbian Themes\u2019 and a James Bond\nMedley which were met with\nenthusiastic audience response.\nOrchestra was then joined by the\nchoir for a brilliant ending to the\nconcert, performing the Triumphal\nMarch from Aidia.\nI had an incredible time and I\nreally would urge you to check out\nthe ICSM Music society, I\u2019ve yet to\nbe disappointed by a concert.\nSome of the Dinner Club volunteers.

Don\u2019t get me\nwrong here. I\u2019m not talking about\nMATLAB, maths, or even anything\nrelated to numbers. I\u2019m talking\nabout food. Matrices of food. There\nis no better cure for OCD than\nstaring at perfectly positioned rows\nof doughnuts.\nOne of those particular matrices\nthat always succeeds to stop me\nin my tracks even while being 10\nminutes late to a lecture is eclairs.\nEclairs from Maitre Choux.\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. What\nare eclairs? Wikipedia defines them\nas \u201can oblong pastry made with\nchoux dough filled with a cream and\ntopped with icing.\u201d Or according\nto my dear friend Carolyn \u2013 posh\nI wonder if he leaves chocolate squares wherever he goes.\nPhoto Credit: Christy Lam\nFrench hot dogs.\nAnd Maitre Choux? To most\nof you it may be just a patisserie\non the ooh-la-la French side of\nSouth Kensington. In fact, it is\nthe world\u2019s first and only choux\nspecialist patisserie where the three-vMichelin star chef Joakim Prat\ntransforms the traditional French\ndelights into works of art.\nYou really have to go see for\nyourself. The small shop with a\nsimple,white exterior with colourful\ndots everywhere. You really cannot\nmiss it between the typical, boring,\nold red brick houses. If you are\nlucky, you also get a strong whiff\nof that warm, cosy, aromatic scent\nof baking choux drifting from the\novens in the basement.\nWalk closer to the window and you\nwill see what I meant by matrices of\neclairs. Neat, straight, perfect arrays\nof eclairs in a rainbow of colours.\nBright red, apple green, sunflower\nyellow. Rose pink, coffee brown,\nshining gold. Each beautifully\ndecorated by hand with tender\nloving care. Instagram moment.\nTrust me, they are as good as they\nlook. A delicate, soft choux pastry\nencasing a velvety smooth cream in\nsurprising and exotic flavours.Think\nPersian pistachio, Tahitian vanilla\nand\u2026 popcorn. They update their\ncreations every season like clothes\nin a shop so you will never get\nbored.Pleasure for the mind,mouth\nand soul.\nI mean, whoever thought this looked like a ballerina had clearly never actually seen one. Photo Credit: FELIX\nEclairs?\nPosh\nfrench hot\ndogs\nChristy Lam\nWriter\nN\not as complex to make\nas a fine \u00e9clair, but\nwith just as much flair\nand style, a pavlova is a\ndelicious summer pudding. Hailing\nfrom New Zealand or Australia,\ndepending on who you believe, it\nwas named after the famed ballerina\nAnna Pavlova, whose ethereal frills\nit resembles. It\u2019s a pretty classic\ndessert now \u2013 but for a very good\nreason.What could go wrong with a\ncrispy, marshmallow-like cake with\nheaps of whipped cream and fresh\nfruit?\nWell, the short answer is\neverything. Pavlovas require a lot\nof arm work \u2013 or an electric beater\n\u2013 to make the meringue, which\nafter all that effort can split and\nbecome watery in the oven. After\nyour careful beating and baking, the\nmeringue can then collapse as you\nlet it rest.\nThis recipe is designed to be as fool\nproof as possible, but you do have to\nfollow all the steps as accurately as\npossible!\nFruit wise, it\u2019s entirely up to you \u2013\nI am particularly fond of a pavlova\nPavlov(a)\u2019s dog\nwith mango, strawberries and\npassion fruit, but will also happily\nadd pineapple, any fresh berries or\neven thinly sliced apple. Just make\nsure that it\u2019s fresh, tasty and ideally\nin season.\nIngredients:\n6 egg whites, from medium eggs\n\u2013 make sure there is absolutely no\negg yolk!\n330g icing sugar (caster can be\nused, but takes longer to dissolve)\n2 teaspoons white vinegar\n1 teaspoon cornflour\n300mls whipping cream\nFresh fruit \u2013 see above\nSpeed is key here. Preheat the\noven to 120C \u2013 and don\u2019t use\nthe fan. Line a baking tray with\ngreaseproof paper, and draw a circle\non it as a template for your pavlova.\nTake a large mixing bowl and make\nsure it is very clean \u2013 any fat will\nstop the egg whites from whipping.\nAdd all the egg whites, and start\nbeating! It\u2019s easiest to use a whisk,\nthough some people swear by a\nfork. This stage is much easier with\nelectric beaters. Once they reach\nvery stiff peaks, start incorporating\nthe sugar, one tablespoon at a time.\nThe mixture should transform into\na glossy, smooth meringue. Feel\na small amount inbetween your\nfingers \u2013 it should be completely\nsmooth, with no sugar. If there is\nany, keep whisking to dissolve it.\nWhen it\u2019s all dissolved, fold in the\nvinegar and cornflour. Scoop the\nmixture onto your prepared paper,\nand spread to your desired shape. I\nlike mine very thick with a chewy/\ngooey core, but some people go\nthin and crispy. Bake in the oven\nfor 1-2 hours, turning the oven\noff as soon as the meringue begins\nto colour. Don\u2019t worry if it leaks a\nsmall amount of sugar syrup. Turn\nthe oven off, and leave the meringue\nto cool inside with the door open.\nWhen completely cool, start\nbuilding the pavlova. Whip the\ncream \u2013 add a touch of icing sugar\nif you like, or maybe some fruit\npuree \u2013 and spoon that over the\nbase. Top with the fresh fruit, and\nmaybe sprinkle some toasted flaked\nalmonds or white chocolate curls on\ntop. Devour.\nSANJAY BHATTACHARYA\n\n"

Since\nthen Nintendo have attempted to\nstreamline their games, making\nthem both accessible to core and\nmore casual audiences. Twilight\nPrincess was interesting in the fact\nthat it was released for both the\nGameCube and Wii, with motion\ncontrols added to the latter. The\nWii U version of the game is not\nmuch more than a HD re-release\n\u2013 removing the motion controls to\nmake it more like the original.\nThe Wii U, like the GameCube,\nhas not been the success Nintendo\nhad hoped for. Both have ended\nup following similar paths, with\nNintendo, in defeat, focusing on its\ncore franchises and fans. Twilight\nPrincess was released during the\ntwilight period of the GameCube\nand its HD update has been\nsimilarly released during the end\ndays of the Wii U.

The\nfirst person exploration game, that\nwill be familiar to anyone who\nhas played Pugh\u2019s previous works,\nlasts around 20 minutes (it\u2019s free,\nso don\u2019t complain). In this short\nburst of narrative, Simon Amstell\nvoices a stage manager who talks\nto the player over a loudspeaker.\nHis character is both charming and\nhilarious (which pretty much sums\nup Amstell).\nHowever, the game\u2019s title is\ndeceiving because, as the result\nof some unexplained mishap, you\nare unable to play the fictional Dr\nLangeskov game, and must instead\nensure the game runs smoothly\nbehind the scenes. The player\u2019s\nenvironment becomes a metaphor\nfor the mechanics that come\ntogether to form a game. Much like\na techie (the theatre sort), you must\npull levers and press buttons. And\nnothing ever goes right.The \u2018stage\u2019\ndirects the player via humorously\nlabeleddoors,guidedinfurtherdetail\nby Amstell\u2019s often incomprehensible\ndirections. Although built in Unity,\nthrough a combination of lighting\nand minimal cell-shading the\nenvironments are able to match the\natmosphere of more substantial,\nretail games. Few studios deliver\nsuch bold statements of intent with\ntheir debut releases. Dr. Langeskov\nis proof that games don\u2019t need to be\nlong to be exciting or memorable.\nof the game (which even in 2006\nlooked pretty bad) reflects the\nrelatively small increase in detail,\nin both geometry and textures, that\nNintendo\u2019s games have undergone\nin comparison to their rivals.\nA number of small gameplay\nfeatures have been simplified to\nmake certain interactions less\nfrustrating (the Wii U controller\nmakes switching items and between\nLink and Wolf a doddle) \u2013 in the\nsame way that Nintendo has added\neasy modes and refined player\ninteractions so that their games\nare accessible to all. They may\nhave focused once again on core\nfranchises, but these games are\nnow more suited to \u2018casual\u2019 gamers.\nPossibly the most illuminating\nfeature of the Twilight Princess HD\nis its use of Amiibos,Nintendo\u2019s toy-to-life series. The implementation\nhere screams of a company out of\nideas, revisiting old franchises to\nsell toys. Has Nintendo given up? It\nseems so. There are no major games\non the horizon other than Zelda\nWii U (the only game they will be\nshowing at this summer\u2019s E3). It\u2019s\na sad time to be a Nintendo gamer\nand a Wii U owner.\nThese are not only the twilight\nyears of the Wii U, but the twilights\nyears of an era of Nintendo defined\nby a serious lack of growth.\nIt\u2019s a sad\ntime to be\na Nintendo\ngamer and\na Wii U\nowner\n\n"

What this means is that for\nbetter or for worse, there\u2019s very little\nevidence to base decisions on.There\nare, however, opinions and studies\naplenty with which you can use\nto form your opinion, but nothing\nshould taken to be a hard and fast\nrule.\nThe debate centres around a few\nkey arguments concerning areas\nsuch as the economy, immigration\nand security, and further issues\nunder these umbrellas.The economy\nis arguably the most important of\nthese,with it being a case of whether\nmembership of the EU helps or\nhurts UK trade deals as well as the\nissue of sovereignty.\nWhile it can be said that the EU\nmeans countries are, in some cases,\nlocked into trade deals with large,\nemerging markets such as China\nand India (with whom we may have\ngotten a better deal by negotiating\nsolo) the countries that the UK\ndoes a substantial amount of trade\nwith are EU members. This means\nbarriers between us and them may,in\nO\nver the course of the\nlast UK election period\nand for the bulk of 2016\nso far, the media and\nnews in general has been focussed\non the UK\u2019s membership within\nthe European Union, but what\u2019s\nactually going on?\nWhere did the EU come from?\nIn essence the European Union\n(EU) is a group of 28 countries who\nall have one thing in common: they\nall occupy a corner of the world and\nhave been bickering over who owns\nwhich part for thousands of years,\noften in quite bloody wars.\nIt took one big war (World War\nII) to finally accept that enough\nwas enough and that some way of\nstopping this from happening again\nwas needed. The EU was preceded\nby two other unions, the European\nCoal and Steel Community and the\nEuropean Economic Community,\nas a way to tie countries together\neconomically, making them less\nlikely to declare war on each other,\nsomething generally regarded as a\ngood thing.\nIt grew from just the founding six\ncountries in the 1950s (Belgium,\nFrance, Italy, the Netherlands,\nLuxembourg and West Germany)\nadding over half a billion people\nand 24 official languages to reach\nits current membership levels. The\nunion, once seen as a stronghold\nagainst communism, has n o w\nexpanded such that it\nencapsulates many\nof the former\n\u201cEastern Bloc\u201d\ncountries, and almost the entirety of\nEurope with the notable exceptions\nof Switzerland, Iceland and\nNorway. Many countries such as\nAlbania, Macedonia, Montenegro,\nSerbia and Turkey have applied for\nmembership and are in the process\nof being considered.\nAnd what does the EU do?\nThe countries within the EU\npay membership fees, vote on laws\nin the European Parliament and\ncitizens of these countries are part\nof the EU as a whole. This means\nthat these citizens can live,work and\nretire in any other EU country, and\ncan move freely from one country to\nanother thanks to a treaty known as\nthe Schengen Agreement.\nNaturally, the countries also have\nto follow the laws set out by the\nEU\u2019s parliament (for better or for\nworse) and comply with the various\ntrade agreements, sanctions and\nlevies imposed.\nThis union is also taken further\nin 19 of the 28 member states, who\nparticipate in the Eurozone and are\nlinked by a single currency.They can\u2019t\ndecide their own monetary policies\nindividually but the system as a\nwhole allows for lower transaction\ncosts and greater price transparency\nbetween member nations.\nAnd what\u2019s the referendum?\nOn June 23rd\nthe UK is having a\nreferendum to decide whether to\nstay in the EU or leave, in a sort of\npolitical hokey-cokey (except that\nonce we\u2019re in or out it\u2019ll likely be for\na while). If you\u2019re over 18 and are:\na British citizen living in the UK, a\nBritish citizen living abroad for less\nthan 15 years, an EU citizen\nresident in the\nU K\n( a s\nlong\nas you only vote\nin European elections in the\nUK) or a Republic of Ireland\nor Commonwealth citizen\n(this also includes the 2\nEU member states of\nMalta and Cyprus)\nand are resident in\nthe UK, then you\u2019re\neligible to vote as long\nas you register before June the\n7th.\nTough luck if you\u2019re any other\nnationality, as even if you\u2019re a long-term UK resident and UK taxpayer,\nyou don\u2019t get a vote.\nFrom there just a simple majority\nis needed by one side, with no\nminimum turnout required.\nSo who\u2019s on which side?\nThe debate has captured the full\nsupport of some political parties\nand has divided others, with the\nwider public split too. The SNP\nand Lib Dems have all\ntheir MPs supporting the\nRemain campaign as well\nas almost all Labour MPs,\nwhereas around 130 of the 330\nConservative MPs are backing the\nLeave campaign, despite David\nCameron throwing all his weight\nbehind staying in the EU.\nNotable dissension within the\nConservative ranks has come from\nBoris Johnson (former Mayor of\nLondon) and Michael Gove (the\ncurrent Justice Secretary). Jeremy\nCorbyn, once a staunch EU critic\nhas now come out in favour of\nremaining, although the jury is\nstill out as to how sincere this was.\nObama also voiced his anti-Brexit\nstance when he was in Britain last\nmonth, while Donald Trump is\nunsurprisingly anti-EU. Joey Essex\nhas yet to cast his opinion on the\nissue, although he is currently\nfilming a TV show which tackles\nthe referendum, so keep your eyes\npeeled for that...\nSo, the debate\nBoth sides have been flinging\nstatistics and counter-statistics at\neach other, with a huge amount of\nconfusion ensuing. In essence, as\nwithmanythingsinlife,therearefew\ncertainties and there is a risk in both\nstaying in the EU, as well as leaving\nMatt Johnston\nNews Editor\nAn idiot\u2019s guide to the EU referendum\nShould we stay or should we go?\nJoey Essex\nhas yet to\ncast his\nopinion on\nthe issue\nthe short term at least, hinder trade\npost-Brexit. The IMF, World Bank\nand OECD have issued reports\nadvising against the UK leaving\nthe EU, but Brexit supporters urge\nthat on its own two feet the UK will\nhave more autonomy to spend its\ntaxes and implement its subsidies as\nit sees fit, in ways more suited to the\nneeds of the British economy.\nUncertainty about the economy\npost-Brexit may cause companies\nto either reduce investment in the\nUK or take their business elsewhere\nentirely but,if the UK did eventually\nbecome stronger on its own the\nopposite could happen, with more\ncompanies choosing to expand their\nbusinesses into the UK rather than\nother EU member states.\nThe issue of the EU\u2019s growing\npower, not only over policies and\nlaw, but to the point of the control\nof the fiscal policy of each and\nevery country is a scenario touted\nby anti-EU campaigners. This\nscenario would be tricky without a\nfull currency union, but the UK will\nalways be more on the fringe of the\nEU if it doesn\u2019t change to the euro\nfrom the pound. This would likely\nbe met with great hostility since the\nEurozone crisis was a large factor\nin the recent global recession, and\nwas blamed for the high levels of\nyouth unemployment in Greece and\nSpain.\nFurthermore, the Leave campaign\nsay that should the UK leave the\nEU, trade with European countries\nwould still continue; they rely on\ntrade with us as much as we rely\non trade with them. This supposes\na scenario in which the UK gets\nseemingly all the benefits of trade\nwith the EU without having to\npay membership fees. This is not\nan impossible series of events but\nif other countries see this they\u2019re\nlikely to feel cheated, leading to\neither them shunning the UK or\nopting out themselves. A domino\neffect of countries leaving could lead\nto the collapse of the EU, making\ntrade deals a lot harder should\nthese countries revert back to their\nplethora of original currencies.\nSome non-EU members are\ninstead part of the European\nEconomic Area (EEA) such as\nNorway, Iceland and Switzerland\n(kinda) and are not subject to all\nthe membership fees and all the\nregulations of the EU. This leads to\nslightly more freedom but no seat at\nthe EU table deciding the laws that\nthey nevertheless have to follow. In\nsome cases this has worked for them,\nbut we are a much bigger economy\nand one which relies on sectors\nother than fishing, the Northern\nLights and Roger Federer, meaning\nit might not work out for us or it\nmight work out even better still.\nThe issue surrounding security is\none that is often screamed about,\nwith both sides arguing that we\nwould simultaneously be safer in\nand out of the EU. The sharing of\ninformation within the EU has\nbeen made easier by cooperation\nbetween nations, but the former\nhead of MI6 feels that security\nwould increase should the UK\nleave. This is based on allowing us\nto drop the European Convention\non Human Rights (to allow us\nto deport criminals such as Abu\nHamza), share information more\nfreely with non-EU countries, as\nwell as strengthen our borders\nfrom movement of terrorists\nthat reside within the EU. The\nConvention on Human Rights\nis usually seen as a good thing on\nthe whole though, and this would\nbe unlikely to be dropped (I mean\nBritain did draft the original rights\nin the first place).\nThe counterargument on our\nborders does have a bit of a twist\ntoo, with the 20 miles of English\nWe rely on\nsectors\nother than\nfishing, the\nNorthern\nLights and\nRoger\nFederer\nChannel making the UK different\nfrom full Schengen (free movement)\nmembers. This extends into a treaty\nwith France known as\u201cLeTouquet\u201d,\nin which the British border is\n(kinda) in France, something that\nmay or may not disappear if we left\nthe EU. This leads to a situation in\nwhich refugees could claim asylum\nin Britain as currently they have to\nactually step foot on the mainland\nto do so. Whether we should be\nallowing more refugees in is a whole\nother kettle of fish.\nOther more pressing issues are\npresent too, as the UK is likely to\nbe pretty disliked at Eurovision\nshould we leave, although we can\u2019t\nreally slip down the rankings much\nfurther anyway.\nThis is by no means anywhere close\nto being exhaustive on the debate,\nyou need to go and research the\naspects that are most important to\nyou. One topic that might be close\nto home is the scientific community\nwithin Europe. Pulling out of this\nmight constrict the opportunities\nyou have to work abroad and make\ncross border research harder to\ncomplete or it may deregulate and\nkickstart your industry.\nIf you want an opinion on\nwhether Brexit would be a good\nor bad move, your professional\ninstitute might be a good place to\nstart. Imperial students have also\nset up two opposing campaigns,\nthe pro-EU ICL Students 4 EU\nand the pro-Brexit Students for\nBritain, which can be found on\nTwitter at @Imperial4EU and\n@SfBImperial respectively.\nWhat else is going on\nthough?\nThe debate cannot be taken as\nan isolated issue, and other global\npolitical and economic issues\nundoubtedly cross over into the pros\nand cons of the EU referendum.\nOne of the most prevalent of these\nhas been the ongoing refugee crisis,\nwith immigration a key point\nbeing argued by\nthe leave\ncamp.\nThe\narguments presented above may\nhelp or hinder this problem but\nthere is a case to be made that the\nmigrant issue is bigger than just the\neconomic elements it presents and\nis instead an issue of morality.\nThe arguments around\nimmigration and security also\nstretch into the recent terrorist\nattacks in mainland Europe,\nbringing the potential pitfalls of the\nSchengen Zone and the successes\nof cross border agencies such as\nEuropol to the forefront of media\ncoverage.\nThe recent referendum in Scotland\nhas stirred up independence talks\nand the SNP have promised\nanother referendum should the\nU K as a whole vote to leave\nthe EU\nyet Scotland vote to remain. A\nsimilar promise has been touted\nin Northern Ireland, with the\nadded complication of the Irish\nreunification debate. With the\nborder between Northern Ireland\nand the Republic of Ireland being\nthe only mainland border the UK\nshares with the EU (putting the\ncomplex situation in Gibraltar\naside) there are questions as to\nwhether a \u2018hard\u2019 border would have\nto be imposed, a situation that\nwould likely inflame relations in\nIreland, a place only recently free of\nThe Troubles.\nThe internal politics within the\nConservative Party is another factor\nat play, as David Cameron has said\nhe won\u2019t serve a third term as PM,\nleaving the door open for a new\nleader, who could potentially be\ndecided by the referendum. Front\nrunners George Osborne and Boris\nJohnson are on opposite sides of the\nargument, with the \u201cwinner\u201d likely\nto get a boost in the leadership race.\nThe upcoming election in the\nUS may also have ripples this side\nof the pond too, as if, God forbid,\nDonald Trump were to clinch the\npresidency we might be negotiating\nin a very different world of politics.\nHe\u2019s pro-Brexit but who knows\nhow much UK trade would feature\nin making America great again (I\nmean the current Secretary of State\nfor Business and London Mayor are\nboth of Muslim heritage and may\nnot be willing or even able to enter\nthe US under Trump\u2019s proposals).\nWhy should I vote?\nWhatever happens this is going\nto have effects on your everyday life,\nso shine your crystal balls, weigh up\nthe risks and benefits of both sides,\ncome to a decision and then for the\nlove of God, vote. It\u2019s your future.\nAnd if you don\u2019t vote the elderly\nwill, and they\u2019ll be dead soon.\nICU is holding an EU debate on the\n2nd\nof June in Skempton 164. Check\nFacebook for details.\nThe UK\nis likely to\nbe pretty\ndisliked at\nEurovision\nshould we\nleave\nIn, out, in out, shake it all about.

Photo Credit: The 100\nT\nhe 100 is a cult teen\ndrama focused on post-apocalyptic America.\nIt has a significant,\nprimarily American following\nwho mobilised quickly following\nthe airing of an episode on the 3rd\nMarch to launch an enormous\nonline campaign. During the\nshow, a character is shot as part\nof the story arc that is directly\nlinked to her finally acting on\nher feelings and kissing another\nfemale character. This exploitation\n\u2013 the \u2018Bury Your Gays\u2019 TV trope\n\u2013 understandably did not sit well\nwith fans of the show, leading to the\nhashtag #LGBTFansDeserveBetter\ntrending for seven hours, with over\n300,000 tweets written immediately\nafter the show aired. The nature\nof this campaign is that it has\nlong progressed from a complaint\nabout a character being killed off\non one show, and is now about\nchallenging the industry for overall\nrepresentation.\nAn adult\nmale\nbelieved\nthat the\nway she\nwas loving\nsomeone\nwas wrong\nNow, obviously characters die in\nshows. It\u2019s incredibly rare that a\nshow could run for a whole series\nor more without killing a main or\nrecurring character, whether due\nto contractual issues or a necessary\nending to a story arc. That said,\nLGBT representation on TV has\na rocky history, and playing in to\nharmful and toxic tropes is not a\ngood way to handle a necessary\ndeath, so that your actor can leave\nthe show.\nA large part of the response from\nthe network and the show has been\nto tell us that Lexa,the character that\nwas shot, was not killed off because\nshe was a lesbian. However the fact\nremains that she died because an\nadult male believed that the way\nshe was loving someone was wrong.\nIgnorance of the issue within the\nindustry in which you work, where\nwriting and background research\nis literally what you are paid for, is\nabsolutely not a valid excuse. If you\ndon\u2019t want to engage in the real-world politics of a lesbian character,\nLGBT\nviewers\ndeserve to\nsee happy\nfutures\nthen do not write one whose primary\nemotional arc is whether her love is\nright or wrong and then kill her for\nit. If they truly didn\u2019t mean to strike\na political or personal nerve, they\nsure fucked up.\nUnderrepresented groups\nare continually denied positive\nportrayals, making it harder to\nvisualize a positive outcome for\ntheir own future. When death and\ndespair are the only features of the\nlives you regularly see for characters\nthat reflect you, it rapidly becomes\ndamaging. It\u2019s no secret that the\nrate of suicide is considerably\nhigher in the LGBT community\nthan national averages, with a\n2011 study by the CDC finding\nLGBT youth four times more\nlikely to attempt suicide than their\nstraight peers. Isn\u2019t it about time we\nstopped normalizing this narrative\nof no happy endings in mainstream\nmedia? LGBT viewers deserve to\nsee happy futures reflected in easily\naccessible media.\nLGBT representation in all\nforms never got off to a good start;\nmany of the first modern media\ndepictions came from the 1930s\nwhere intense social control existed.\nIt was not a good time for the media:\nregulations like the Hays Code\nexisted that forbade the depiction of\nmixed-race relationships, amongst\nothers. In this environment, LGBT\nrepresentation of any kind was only\nallowed under the premise that\nLGBT characters were immoral by\ndint of being LGBT and as such\ncould not be allowed to be happy in\nsaid \u2018immorality\u2019. LGBT characters\ncould only exist if their storyline was\nto be punished, and this manifested\nprimarily as the characters being\nkilled off. The cultural narrative\nbecame that gay characters died,\none that we have evidently not\nmoved past.\nIn the context of this current\ndiscussion stemming from the\ndeath of a lesbian, it is worth noting\nthe specific toxicity relating to\nlesbian representation in media.The\nhistory of women dying in media\nhas intrinsic roots in misogyny. The\nconcept of women in relationships\nwith other women has long been\nfetishised by the straight cis-men\nthat control the production and\ndistribution of mainstream media.\nThis meant that in the 1950s a\nhuge quantity of pulp lesbian novels\nwere produced that allowed the\nfetishisation of these relationships,\nlong before the taboo that would\nnot allow them to be considered\nas healthy or meaningful was left\nbehind. And so to allow for their\nproduction within the social climate\nof the time, the lesbian couple could\nnever have a happy ending. The two\nmost common options for the end\nof these novels were for one woman\nto go insane (as homosexuality was\nstill viewed as an actual mental\ndisorder), or one woman to die and\nthe other to return to a heterosexual\nrelationship. This is sadly a trope\nthat doesn\u2019t seem to be expiring any\ntime soon.The belief of many media\ncreators seems to be that lesbian\ncharacters are allowed only if the\nwomen remain sexually available\nto men, or that their relationship is\nonly sexual.\nWe\u2019ve seen the overall cultural\ntrend shift in recent years but it\nfundamentally remains that LGBT\npeople suffer. In modern media\nthis is often more in the context\nof noble suffering in the face of an\nunforgiving world, from violence,\ndisease, or AIDS. It remains the\noverwhelming majority of films and\nbooks in which LGBT people suffer\noutweighs all other narratives.\nThe 100 playing in to this\nnarrative has provoked what can\nonly be a long overdue conversation.\nThe campaign springing from the\nepisode continues to put pressure\non the industry, and maintains\na fundraising arm that is raising\nmoney for the LGBT suicide\nprevention organization The\nTrevor Project. The drive has raised\nover $120,000 from nearly 4000\nindividual donations. In the words\non their website \u201cThere is not much\nwe can do in the way of changing\nwhat\u2019s already been written. What\nwe can do however, is unite to\nhelp those who are hurting and\ndespondent through this.\u201d All I can\nsay is that it really is time for the\nBury Your Gays trope to die.\nReflections on the Barbican Estate\nHussain Al-Jabir\nWriter\nF\nriends of mine will know\nthat I have a great affinity\nfor F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The\nGreat Gatsby. His timeless\nexpos\u00e9 of the superficiality of the\nnouveau riche and the upper classes,\nexamined in cinematic description,\nis simply breath-taking, with a\nmessage that is as pertinent today as\nin the contemporary era.Though the\nbook is more usually associated with\nlove and materialism,the spectacular\nand haunting descriptions at the\nclose of the novel shed light on\nfailed aspirations; something which\nI encountered myself not too long\nago.\nBefore this begins to sound too\nmuch like the English essays that\nImperial students shunned long\nago, I should explain further. I study\nin St Bart\u2019s Hospital, and walking\nback one day from Waitrose \u2013 yes,\nI was picking up free coffee, and no\nplease don\u2019t judge me \u2013 I chose to\nwalk through the Barbican Estate,\nbetween the tower blocks instead\nof the tunnel beneath its buildings.\nI chose the path \u201cless travelled\u201d,\nand just as Robert Frost thought,\nI believe \u201cthat has made all the\ndifference\u201d.\nI\u2019d never really thought much\nabout the Barbican Estate before.\nLocated on the fringes of the City,\nI pass by the concrete tower blocks\nregularly on my way to the hospital,\nbut usually think of it as little more\nthan a lamentable 1960s relic, an\neyesore to regret, not revere. During\nthe war, the City was heavily\nbombed and mostly destroyed,\nrequiring extensive renovation.\nAmong the unrealised plans of\nbuilding giant motorways through\ncentral London and excavating\nenormous underground carparks\n\u2013 sensing a theme here? \u2013 the\nBarbican Estate was meant to be\nthe epitome of a new architectural\nvision, with public courtyards\ninterspersed between \u2018modern\u2019tower\nblocks. Gone were the medieval\nalleyways, the Barbican would\nfeature \u201cstreets in the sky\u201d, in a\nutopian fantasy built from state-of-the-art reinforced concrete. Three\nof the tallest residential towers\nin London would dominate the\nskyline, while a moat would conjure\nimages of an ancient castle within\nthe post-modern setting. This was\nthe future in 1970,and the Barbican\nCentre was its archetype.\nFast-forward forty years and the\nutopian visions have faded with\nthe weathering of the concrete\nfa\u00e7ades. \u201cStreets in the sky\u201d turned\ninto corners for crime, while the\ngrandiose fantasies of the public\nstrolling through were replaced by\nbusy commuters rushing through\na tunnel built for function, not\nfascination. No longer a vision of\nmodernity, the Barbican Estate\nhas become a symbol of the shortsightedness of 1960s architecture\nand many would not object to its\ndemolition.\nA utopian\nfantasy built\nfrom state-of-the-art\nreinforced\nconcrete\nShafts of light astride weathered concrete columns: The Barbican Estate today. Photo Credit: Michael Shaw\nWalking as I did on that day,\nI saw something quite different.\nStaring at sights, otherwise etched\ninto memory, I saw past my current\nvision, right back to its soul, which\ntaken literally is the very essence\nThe concrete colossus captures the optimism of\nthe architechural era\nof its existence. Along the sculpted\npathways,you cannot fail to note the\nsheerscaleandscopeofthearchitects\u2019\nvisions. The optimism with which\nthe towers are named after great\nBritish authors. The persistence of\na small puddle, the only remains\nof a great moat surrounding this\nfortress of modernity. And above\nall, you cannot ignore the sense of\nhope \u2013 the hope that people would\nwalk around the estate, and enjoy it,\nrather than taking the road tunnel.\nLooking around, instead of seeing\nthe estate as it is, I saw it just as\nFitzgerald\u2019s Nick Carraway saw\nLong Island inThe Great Gatsby:\u201cA\nfresh green beast of the new world\u201d,\nwith all the hope and optimism of\na generation looking forward to\npeacetime after decades of war. The\nconcrete may be rotting away today,\nbut the blazing passion underlying\nthe centre remains visible for as long\nas it stands.\nAll things are transient, and this\nrealisation was no exception. A\nvision seen for the first time is also\nthat vision seen for the last time.\nEvery time I go to St Bart\u2019s hospital,\nand every time I see the Barbican\nagain, it will still look as it always\ndoes \u2013 a building of the past,d\u00e9mod\u00e9\nto our eyes. For one metaphysical\nhour, I saw past my own sight, to\naspirations long thwarted; if past\nexperience is proof,I shouldn\u2019t think\nI will see that again.\n\n"

In\nan effort to be more\npositive this week, I\u2019m going\nto heap praise on my favourite\nfilm-producing country \u2013 Japan.\nLooking past the endlessly\nchurned out anime crap,animated\nJapanese cinema may very well be\nthe best in the world. \u2013 Miyazaki,\nKatsuhiro \u00d4tomo and Mamoru\nHosoda are unmatched in the\neyes of many critics. But it would\nbe nice for live action films get a\nlook in:\nTokyo Sonata (2008)\nWhen reviewing the French\n\u2018style\u2019of filmmaking I commented\non its annoying fascination with\nendless dialogue and rich young\npeople\u2019s tiresome love lives. No\nfilm shows off the vastly superior\nJapanese filmmaking philosophy\nas Tokyo Sonata. Much like a\nmodern-day Tokyo Story, the film\nis a classic Japanese slice-of-life\ndrama focused on family and\nappreciating small things in life.\n13 Assassins (2010)\nMuch like Tokyo Sonata is a\nmodern-day, version of the classic\nTokyo Story,13 Assassins represents\na new-and-improved version of\nSeven Samurai. It tells the classic\nstory of an elite team taking on\nhordes of bad-guys threatening\na poor village, with everything\nramped up to 11. Seven Samurai\nmay be the critic\u2019s favourite but\nnever try to challenge Takeshii\nMike on violent spectacle.\nDepartures (2008)\nI\u2019m surprised that I\u2019ve never\nspoken about Departures before.\nThe problem is that it\u2019s hard to\ndescribe it in a way that does\njustice to how beautiful and life\naffirming it is. It tells of a newly\nunemployed cellist who takes\nup a job preparing the dead\nfor their funerals. The film is\nhugely intelligent and uniquely\nemotional. It explores the topics\nof death, family, and Japanese\nsensibilities better than any other\nfilm I have ever seen.\nBEN COLLIER\nDocumentary corner: King of Kong\nBen Collier\nWriter\nA\ns this will be my last\nDocumentary Corner\nfeature of the year, I\nthought it fitting to end\non a high note, with my favourite\ndocumentary of all time \u2013 King\nof Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. It\nworks in every way a documentary\nshould, and then some. Director\nSeth Gordon was able to create\na suspenseful, exciting, and\ncompletely engrossing film about\none of the strangest and most niche\ntopics imaginable \u2013 competitive\nDonkey Kong.\nAs I said in one of the older\neditions of documentary corner, a\ngood documentary can take a topic\nyou love and make it exciting and\ninteresting, but a great documentary\nshould be able to get the same\nreaction for a topic you know\nnothing about.King of Kong is about\ntwo men competing for the Donkey\nKong world-record high score.\nSince it came out, a lot of people\nhave taken to simply referring to it\nas \u2018Billy vs Steve\u2019 because of its two\nmain characters \u2013 Billy Mitchell\nand Steve Wiebe.\nThe director has a lot of fun with\nclassic Hollywood archetypes when\nshowing us the two men: Mitchell\nis an icon in the world of arcade\ngaming, holding countless world\nrecords and has an ego to match.\nWiebe is an outsider to this culture\n\u2013 an incredibly humble and likeable\nguy, who is intimidated and picked\non by Mitchell and his goons at\nevery turn as he tries to achieve the\nfirst truly extraordinary thing in his\nlife. This underdog story really does\nboil down to a classic tale of good vs\nevil, and it\u2019s handled perfectly.\nThere is bundles of style to be\nfound here. A fine line is walked\nbetween silliness and seriousness,\nbetween drama, action, and comedy.\nThe editing and style of filming also\nlends a great retro feel to each scene.\nThe documentary is aware of the\neccentricities of the topic and has\nfun with it \u2013 because of this, the\naudience is also able to have fun too.\nOverall, however, it is the story\nthat drives everything. At points\none begins to question if Mitchell\nis even a real person: he\u2019s so\ndeliciously evil he even looks like\na cheesy Hollywood villain \u2013 think\nBen Stiller in Dodgeball. If it weren\u2019t\nfor the genuine sincerity of it all,\none might mistake King of Kong as\na mockumentary, but at the end of\nthe day, despite some silliness, the\nstory of Steve Wiebe is an inspiring\none. Having such a genuine and\neasy-to-root-for protagonist cuts\nthrough a lot of the humour to give\na touching heart to a truly unique\nand wonderful project. Originally,\nthe film was supposed to be about\nretro gaming culture as a whole (we\nsee a little bit of this with small\nfeatures on other world champions\nlike \u2018Roy Awesome\u2019), but the\nnarrative Mitchell and Wiebe gave\nthe producers was just too good to\nignore. As such, the story unfolded\nthroughout filming, and we get to\nexperience the narrative progress\njust as the filmmakers did. And\nwhat a narrative it is.\n\u201cWell maybe they\u2019d like it if I\u2019d lose. Maybe I should try losing sometime.\u201d \u2013 Billy Mitchell. Photo Credit: King of Kong PR\nFlorence Foster Jenkins and the\ncinematic allure of musical enigmas\nL\nast week saw the release\nof Florence Foster Jenkins,\na biopic based on the life\none of the worst singers of\nall time \u2013 Florence Foster Jenkins\nwas widely regarded as a completely\nhopeless singer, a fact she didn\u2019t\nlet get in the way of attempting to\nforge a musical career. Recordings\nfrom the time betray a complete\nlack of pitch, rhythm, intonation,\nand tone \u2013 a fact that may have been\nlinked to a syphilis-linked decay of\nher central nervous system. Cheery!\nWhile the Stephen Frears-directed\nfilm, starring Meryl Streep, may\nhave been welcomed with more\npraise than Jenkin\u2019s singing voice,\nshe\u2019s not the only outsider musician\nout there who deserves to have a\nfilm made about her. Here are four\nmore left-field performers who\ndeserve a movie of their own:\nBig Edie\nEdith Ewing Bouvier Beale,\notherwise known as \u2018Big Edie\u2019,\nmay have already had a film\nmade about her \u2013 in the form of\nAlbert and David Maysles\u2019 1975\ndocumentary Grey Gardens, which\ncharts the destructive and isolating\nrelationship between her and her\ndaughter, \u2018Little Edie\u2019 \u2013 but such a\nlarge character deserves a film all of\nher own. Beale, the aunt of Jackie\nKennedy, used to be an amateur\nsinger, before she ensconced herself\nin her dilapidated mansion, and\nfell into poverty. Grey Gardens is a\ndisturbing,twisted film,in which the\ndestitution of the main characters\nis only enlivened by Little Edie\u2019s\nfrequent quotable lines \u2013 \u2018I only\ncare about three things: dancing,\nswimming, and the Catholic church\n\u2013 and Big Edie breaking out into\nsong. In her late 70s when the\nfilm came out, Big Edie\u2019s voice is\nas strong as ever, belying an early\ntalent. A film looking at her early\nlife would be a fantastic companion\npiece to Grey Gardens.\nThe Space Lady\nMoving on, The Space Lady, a\nparadigm of the outsider music\nmovement,spent much of the 1970s\nand 80s singing melancholic covers\nof popular songs on the streets of\nBoston and San Francisco. Initially\naccompanied by an accordion, she\nlater made the switch to a Casio\nsynthesiser keyboard, which gave\nher songs a cosmic edge; despite the\nlimitations of the synthesiser, which\nonly has six rhythm patterns,\nshe managed to convert an\nastonishing range of music\ninto her unique vision.\nRetiring in 2000, many\ncommentators speculated about\nher whereabouts, fuelled by online\nbootlegs of her recordings. In 2012\nshe came out of retirement, the\nresurgence in interest securing her a\nrecord deal and a world tour. We all\nlove a redemption tale in film, and\nthe fact that she\u2019s still performing\nmakes a documentary all the more\nnecessary.\nShin Jung-Hyun\nAll the best musicians fight\nagainst \u2018the man\u2019, but South Korea\u2019s\n\u201cGodfather of Rock\u201d, Shin JungHyun went further than most.\nActive in the 1960s and 70s, Shin\nbecame known in Korea for his\npsychedelic-tinged rock, which\ndrew on the influences introduced\nby marines stationed at U.S. Army\nbases. It drew the attention of\nPresident Park Chung-Hee, who\nasked Shin to write a song in praise\nof the presidency \u2013 Shin refused,\nand instead composed \u2018Beautiful\nRivers and Mountains\u2019, a song\nthat extolled the natural beauty of\nKorea, and ironically took its name\nfrom a line in the national\nanthem. Needless to\nsay, President Park\ndidn\u2019t take it well, and\nShin was tortured in\nprison, before being\ncommitted to a\npsychiatric\nhospital. As Korea explores its\nrecent history, with novelists like\nHan Kang leading the charge, it\u2019s\ntime a film was made about Shin,\nand his daring refusal to conform.\nConnie Converse\nFinally, the saddest tale of the\nbunch: Connie Converse moved\nto New York City in the 1940s,\nhoping to break it in the gestating\nfolk scene. While popular with\nother musicians on the scene, for\nwhom Converse would perform,her\nmelancholic folk was never popular\nwith the public. Her songs a both\nwinsome and tragic, and Converse\nwas really ahead of her time \u2013 one\nof the earliest singer-songwriters\nin a world that would soon become\nsaturated with them. Following the\nstratospheric success of Bob Dylan,\nshe left New York for Ann Arbor,\nand then in 1974 she distributed\nnotes to her family and friends, and\nset off in her Volkswagen Beetle for\na better life. She was never heard\nfrom again. A documentary in the\nstyle of Searching for Sugar Man,\nlooking for where Converse went,\nwould bring her beautiful folk to\nlight.\nFRED FYLES\n(L-R): Connie Converse, Little Edie and Big Edie, Shin Jung-Hyun, The Space Lady.

The kits being sold in\nNewcastle can differentiate between\nthese two substances.\nThe idea has been pushed by the\nStudents for Sensible Drug Policy\ngroup at Newcastle, who earlier this\nyear petitioned the university to\nchange its ruling on students found\nwith drugs in halls for the first time.\nThe kits will tell you if your drugs are safe\nThe \u00a37 kits,\nsubsidised\nto \u00a33 for\nstudents,\nwill be\navailable\nfrom the\nstudents\u2019\nunion\nInstead of an immediate fine and\neviction, students found with illegal\ndrugs in university accommodation\nare now given a second chance, as\nlong as they were not caught doing\nit again.\nLove hearts, drugs and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\nA\ndebate about Britain\u2019s\nplace in the EU is due\nto take place at Imperial\non the 2nd\nof June.\nRepresentatives from both camps\nwill be there to argue over whether\nwe should vote to leave the EU on\nthe 23rd\nof June.\nSpeaking for remain is Amelia\nWomack, the deputy leader of the\nGreen party.

Check the\nFacebook event for updates on\nspeakers.\nRent strikes spread across London universities\n1000 students across UCL, Roehampton, Goldsmiths and the Courtauld are\nwithholding rent in protest\nS\ntudents from Goldsmiths,\nRoehampton and the\nCourtauld Institute have\njoined UCL in a rent strike,\nprotesting the high fees and low\nquality housing offered by their\nuniversities. It\u2019s been estimated that\nthis amounts to about \u00a31 million\u2019s\nworth of lost revenue from all the\nstudents combined.\nUnsurprisingly, the NUS has fully\nbacked the strikes. The NUS DP of\nWelfare, Shelly Asquith, said: \u201cIf a\nnational rent strike for affordable\nstudent housing were to happen,the\nunion would support it 100%.\u201d\n750 students from UCL did not\npay their third term\u2019s rent,which was\ndue last Friday. 150 students started\nthe strike in January, and have been\njoined by hundreds of others thanks\nto a high profile campaign.\nThis number now accounts for\n15% of UCL students in halls.They\nare demanding a 40% rent cut.\nAfter an unsuccessful meeting\nIts grand opening happened on Friday\nC\nharing Cross Hospital\u2019s\nonly onsite bar has finally\nbeen refurbished by the\nunion, after consultation\nwith students.\nStreet and hospital signs\n\u2018borrowed\u2019 from other trusts still\nhang on the walls, but the bar\u2019s logo\nhas become slightly snazzier.\nThere is no lime green to be seen.\nThe union promised that the new\nbar\u2019s floor is \u201c100% less sticky\u201d.\nAs part of a consultation survey,\nstudent opinions on the bar\u2019s new\nlook were gathered. The most\ncommon suggestion was an old-fashioned pub-like spaces with\n\u201cbooths\u201d, \u201cwood\u201d and \u201cleather\u201d.\nStudents seemed to want less plastic\nfurniture and more of a heritage\nvibe.\nWith a hospital on one side and\na graveyard on the other, the 450\ncapacity space is a space well-known to medical students as the\nfinal destination for many freshers\nfortnight events. The bar also serves\nfood during the day.\nThe refurbishment was revealed\nat an exclusive launch party for\nBNOCs last Friday, where The\nTechtonics performed.\nThe bar is having an official relaunch tonight (Friday the 13th\n).\nGRACE RAHMAN\nFELIX does not endorse climbing roofs, even for good causes. Photo Credit: Finbarr Fallon\nwith their college management, 300\nstudents at Goldsmiths withheld\na rent payment last Monday. On\naverage, they pay \u00a3150 per week.\nEight students from Roehampton\nare understood to be withholding\nrent, according to the university\u2019s\naccommodation office.\nGoldsmiths\u2019 Cut the Rent\ncampaign told students in a\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nFacebook FAQ that withholding\nrent now would not even risk\neviction as \u201cyou\u2019ll have moved out\nof halls by the time they could evict\nyou\u201d. The Goldsmiths campaign\nalso warns that their university\u2019s\nthreats of fines for late payments\nwould be just that: threats, as there\nis nothing in their housing contracts\nabout such charges.\nThe possibility of eviction is\nreal, but universities are unable to\nthreaten students much further than\nthat, as it is illegal to academically\npenalise for non-tuition fee debts.\nFrom a PR and student welfare\nangle, evicting students during\nexam season is not a great option\nfor the universities.\nLast year, a successful UCL rent\nstrike resulted in students winning\nback a term\u2019s rent (\u00a31368 each).\nUCL have also been accused\nof nelgecting student welfare by\ncutting all bursaries for low income\nstudents. This has only added fuel\nto the fire of the Cut the Rent\ncampaign.\nIn a meeting with strikers, UCL\u2019s\nHead of Estates said he didn\u2019t take\ninto account low income students\nwhen deciding rents, adding that\nsome students \u201csimply could not\nafford to live in London, and that is\njust a fact of life\u201d.\nReynolds bar re-opens after refurb\nA work in progress.

Now, that\nsame amount will be spread over\nthe whole six years. This will mean\nstudents get less money per year,\nbut could help them manage their\nmoney better over the first four\nyears, so they are better off in the\nlast two years of study.

Photo Credit: HBO\nGood luck with exams everyone! Photo Credit: HBO\nA\nnother week, another\nload of dead characters.\nWe start off where we\nleft last time with Jon\nSnow wondering what the hell just\nhappened after being stabbed in\nthe heart, Melisandre wondering\nhow on Earth she just did that and\nDavos trying to remember how he\ngot involved in this storyline in the\nfirst place. Jon then puts some pants\non to talk to the Night\u2019s Watchmen\nand Wildlings that had gathered to\nsee him. He doesn\u2019t end up saying\nmuch and it\u2019s not even 5 minutes\nback in the realm of the living before\nTormund says he\u2019s got a small dick.\nJon seems to have a thing about\ngetting insulted by gingers.\nWe then return to Sam and Gilly\non their first family cruise together\nwhere she finds out they\u2019re staying\nwith his parents while Sam goes\nto college. Always an awkward\nsituation meeting the boy\u2019s family.\nThe most interesting scene of\nthe episode was the flashback with\nBran,this time back to Ned fighting\nArthur Dayne at the Tower of\nJoy. It\u2019s pretty obvious what this\nis leading up to but if anyone\u2019s\nnot caught it yet I won\u2019t spoil. I\u2019m\ndefinitely looking forward to this\nrevelation though.\nDany\u2019s not having the best time,\nturns out the Dothraki are about\nas keen on feminism as Redditors\nare, so they weren\u2019t too happy with\nBack to King\u2019s Landing and\nQyburn is giving orphaned kids\nsweeties so that they\u2019ll talk to him.\nIt\u2019s actually one of the least creepy\nthings about him in all honestly.\nCersei and Jamie then storm down\nto his basement lair with their giant\nzombie friend to chat about Cersei\u2019s\noncoming trial by combat and how\nher being paraded naked down the\nstreets has in no way mellowed\nher out. Incesty Team Rocket then\nmarches up to the Small Council\nchambers before being told that no\none wants to sit on their lunch table\nso they\u2019re left alone again.\nLi\u2019l\u2019 King Tommen then heads\ndown to the prison to ask the High\nSparrow (AKA Birdie Sanders) for\nhis wifey and his mummy back.\nSanders then sits the boy down\nto talk about why the gods think\nhis wife\u2019s a hoe and his mum\u2019s a\ndickhead. Tommen seems fairly\nconvinced by his arguments.\nBack to Braavos and we find Arya\nplaying a game of Lie and Get\nSlapped (essentially the Braavosi\nversion of Jeremy Kyle). She gives\naway her personal information like\nshe\u2019s being audited by the Church of\nScientology until sexy Yoda decides\nto give her vision back.\nWe then return to the North\nwhere Ramsay is struggling to fill\nDaddy\u2019s boots. He\u2019s attempting to\nkeep a member of House Umber\nunder control that\u2019s repeatedly\ncalling him a prick to his face. It\nlooked like this guy\u2019s head was\nabout to roll before revealing he\nhad Rickon Stark and Osha with\nhim, two characters last seen in\nthe season 3 finale. They are really\nquite what yet.\nWe finish, back where we started,\nat the Wall where Jon is having a\nnice public execution to celebrate\nhis rebirth. Sergeant Douchebag\ninsists on getting a last few words\nin before he gets done in whereas\neveryone\u2019s least favourite teenager\nOlly instead opts for just scowling\nat Jon like he just got sent to his\nroom. After this short interlude,\nJon drops the bomb of deciding to\nleave the Night\u2019s Watch, apparently\nciting some of the fine print in the\noath that says if you get murdered\nby a bunch of arseholes you can do\nwhatever you like.\nOverall, I\u2019d say this was a pretty\nsolid episode. The story really is\ngoing full speed ahead this year,\npossibly a results of the 7 season\ntimeline. There\u2019s still the odd bit\nof exposition dumping and clunky\ndialogue that tends to come\nwith D&D writing an episode\nthemselves, but it\u2019s not bad enough\nto take away from the scale of the\nevents. If I had one complaint it\u2019s\nthat this episode seems a little\nrushed, there\u2019s not been much room\nfor decent character development\nthis season between all the big\nmoments and the emotional impact\nof the show has been suffering\nbecause of it.\nGame of Thrones is available on\nHBO Go\nAnother hero is in on the aciton. Photo Credit: The CW\nS\npinning out of the CW\u2019s\nlive action DC shows is an\nanimated one by the name\nof Vixen. This series takes\nplace in its own corner of the called\n\u2018Arrowverse\u2019, offering a take on a\ndifferent kind of hero, as well as\nusing animation to do the things\ntoo expensive for live action. This\nventure is mostly successful but not\nwithout its faults.\nThe biggest thing the series has\nagainst it is the fact that it\u2019s so short.\nDespite being 6 episodes long, the\nentirety of season 1 adds up to a total\nof around 30 minutes. As a result of\nthis, we get a story that, while being\ngood and entertaining, feels rushed\nat times.The villains suffer the most\nfrom this treatment, not being given\nenough motivation as well as having\ntheir defeat and aftermath largely\nglossed over.\nStill, there\u2019s plenty to like here.\nWe see the story of Mari McCabe\nwho\u2019s trying to work out the secret\nof her past. The fact that she\u2019s a\nblack woman helps to bring more\ndiversity to the set of mainstream\nsuperheroes. The show details her\nevolution from confused fashion\ndesigner to someone embracing her\nroots and becoming the hero she\u2019s\ndestined to be. It\u2019s a fairly simple,\ntried and tested formula but one\nMari and her supporting characters\nStill, Vixen has more ups than\ndowns and is a welcome addition to\nthe slew of comic-book adaptations.\nWith season one only being around\nhalf an hour long,this is a series that\ncan be easily watched and might\nprovide some welcome relief from\nall the revision.\nVixen is available on CW Stream\nwonder if there\u2019s any point to their\nappearances. They don\u2019t really serve\nthe story in any way and are more or\nless glorified cameos, reminding us\nthat these are the heroes who share\nthe same universe as Vixen. It\u2019s\nmore frustrating given the fact that\nwith fewer time on these heroes, we\ncould have had more time expanding\non and developing Mari\u2019s story. The\nvoice acting on the guest stars also\nfeels a little stiff, in stark contrast to\nHenry Wild\nWriter\nThere\u2019s some new players in town! And they\u2019re not feeling so friendly. Photo Credit: Netflix\nIt\u2019s the new\ncharacters\nwho ride\nroughshod\nover this\nseason\nwhich nonetheless makes for an\nengaging and entertaining story.\nThe tone of the show is just right,\nmaking it feel like its own thing\nwhile not being bogged down by\nthe limitations of its sister shows.\nThe animation is top notch and\nthe action sequences are well-done. They successfully portray the\npower of having the abilities of\nany animal you can choose, which\nwould be tricky, if not expensive, to\ncontinuously render in live action. It\nmakes one hope that the CW would\ntry this experiment again in the long\nrun, and hopefully introduce more\nheroes with more bizarre powers.\nThe Flash and Arrow also show up,\nthough in a way which makes one\nIt\u2019s a fairly\nsimple,\ntried and\ntested\nformula\nHarry Wilkinson\nWriter\nstretching the viewer\u2019s memories at\nthis point, I mean come on! When\nwe last saw them, Donald Trump\nwas still funny! Nonetheless, this\nreveal does mean big things coming\nup for the North, we\u2019re just not sure\nB\nlood once again soaks the\nstreets of Hell\u2019s Kitchen,\nNew York as Daredevil\nreturns to our computer\nscreens. Whereas the first season\ndetailed the rise of Matt Murdock\nto the role of red-horn-wearing\nsuperhero, this season focuses more\non Matt\u2019s struggles with his new\nrole and with just what it means to\nbe a hero.\nWhile the cast from the previous\nseason all return with performances\njust as good as last time\u2019s,it\u2019s the new\ncharacters who ride roughshod over\nthis season. Jon Bernthal\u2019s Punisher\nand \u00c9lodie Yung\u2019s Elektra threaten\nto steal the show,and in a few places\ndo just that.The Punisher is such an\navatar of on-screen power that the\nepisodes in which he does feature\noften feel more like Punisher\nSeason 1 than Daredevil 2; a power\nwhich I greatly hope he keeps when\nPunisher Season 1 actually lands\nlater this year.\nIn contrast to Jon Bernthal\u2019s\nunhinged fury and despair,\n\u00c9lodie Yung brings a more\nrefined psychopathy to the table,\na character with minimal morals\nand no compunctions about acting\nfor her own goals. While Elektra\u2019s\nbackstory is significantly changed\nfrom the comics, going from a\nwoman who finds solace in murder\nto one cut straight from sociopathic\ncloth, this by no means detracts\nfrom Yung\u2019s fantastic performance.\nAlthough she will likely not win\nover as many fans as the Punisher,\nhers is still a character done well, a\nfemale character who acknowledges\nher sexuality without being defined\nentirely by it.\nIt is these two characters who\nlaunch a two-pronged attack on\nDaredevil\u2019s conscience, on the one\nhand a man who believes that Matt\nhasn\u2019t gone far enough,a man whose\nphilosophy on crime-fighting is best\nsummed up in his own words, \u201cYou\nhit them and they get back up, I hit\nthem and they stay down\u201d. On the\nother hand a woman who represents\nfreedom from the moral code that\nbinds and defines Matt, a temptress\nin both the mental and sexual way.\nDespite the not-infrequent, and\ncertainly well done fight scenes, it\u2019s\nthese philosophical battles which\nmakes this season of Daredevil stand\nout to me. The battle between the\nlawyer and the vigilante, between\nrestraint and necessity, between the\nman of God and freedom, those are\nthe fights that make this season so\ngreat.\nDaredevil Season 2 is available on\nNetflix\nShe\u2019s either\ndead or\ngoing to\nstay in their\nretirement\nhome\nforever\nThe story\nreally is\ngoing full\nspeed\nahead this\nyear\nher roaming around, being a strong\nindependent woman who don\u2019t\nneed no Khal. So they decide she\u2019s\neither dead or going to stay in their\nretirement home forever.\nTyrion\u2019s remains awkward as hell\ntrying to fit in at Meereen with\nDany\u2019s advisors before Varys comes\nin to pick up the conversation with\nsome juicy goss about the nearby\ncities plotting against them. Maybe\nsomething interesting will happen\nin Meereen after all!\n\n"

Due to the organisers\nleaving Imperial and difficulties\nwith finding room, however, this\nthen fell by the wayside.\nThis was revived in 2011 when\nthe chess club and alumni joined\nforces with Imperial College Union\nto host the first congress in over a\ndecade in the shadow of the Royal\nAlbert Hall. The increase in interest\nfor events in London coupled with\nthe fantastic location cemented\nthe congress as a fixture in player\u2019s\ncalendars \u2013 and 2016 marks the\nfifth time the congress has been put\non since then!\nJust under 100 players were\ngathered throughout the last\nweekend of April in the Union\nDining Hall for three days of play.\nSome flew in for the event from\nabroad including from the United\n20\u2026Bb4? [The decisive mistake]\n[necessary was 20...Bxb5 21.Bxb5+ Qxb5 22.Qxa3 with an evenly balanced\ngame]\n21.Rxd7!

Ke7 25.Qd7+ Kf6 26.Rf1+ Kg6 27.Rg8+ Kh6 [or 27...Rg7 28.Qxf7+! Kh6\n29.Qxg7#]\n28.Rf6# [A fitting finish to a fine attacking display from White.]\n1\u20130\nStates, which is a great testament\nto IC Union\u2019s strong reputation for\nproviding an excellent environment\nto play in.\nThe leading contender in the Open\nsection was FIDE Master Terry\nChapman of England, although\ncompetition was fierce as eleven\nplayers rated within 200 ELO\npoints of each other were bunched\nup at the top. In the Major (rated\nunder 2000) section Ray MorrisHill, who won the section at the\nprevious event, again led the field\nand Imperial College alumni (and\nex-chess club president) Nikunj\nSinha headed the list of entrants in\nthe Minor section.\nDue to how tight the competition\nwas in all sections, it perhaps wasn\u2019t\nsurprising to see the emergence of\nsomeone slightly further down the\nentry list as an early contender.\nAlistair Hill took a clear half-point\nlead after Saturday\u2019s games with\nFM Terry Chapman on his heels.\nScotland\u2019s CM Paul Roberts, also\none of the highest rated players in\nthe tournament, fell a full point\nbehind at this point and had a\nbig uphill battle on the Sunday to\nachieve the top positions.\nThe Major showed some more\nof the usual suspects who perform\nconsistently well throughout the\nyear in London\u2019s local leagues\n(Imperial College Chess Club\nparticipates in these, so if you are\na player yourself and fancy some\ncompetitive games, do get in touch\nwith us). Charles McAleenan faced\noff against Ray Morris-Hill in what\ncould have decided the sole lead\nheading into Sunday but fought out\nto a draw, allowing Oliver Finnegan\nto take the overall lead by half a\npoint courtesy of his win over Peter\nWood.\nIn the Minor, Imperial alumnus\nNikunj started round three on\nsecond board, half a point behind\nthe two leaders who actually\nrepresented two thirds of the non-Englishplayersinthesection!Italian\nDomenico Amabile successfully\nwon with black against Cledwyn\nDavies of Wales to set himself up\nwith a sole half-point lead that he\nwould not relinquish, allowing him\nto win the Minor outright.\nOliver Finnegan showed class to\npower through the Major and win\nwith only a single draw and four\nwins,putting him in clear first place.\nAs a testament to the competition,\n2nd\nplace had seven people sharing, a\nfull point behind on 3.5/5 with Ray\nMorris-Hill leading the pack but\nunable to catch.Finally,in the Open\nsection, Terry Chapman fought an\namazingly spirited game in the final\nround to defeat Valentin Gaudeau\nwith the black pieces, and ensure\nhe clawed back the deficit to early\nleader Alistair Hill. This guaranteed\nboth of them a share of 1st\nafter\nAlistair\u2019s final round draw against\nSteven Jones.\nPictured is an exciting game from\nthe congress we can reproduce\nfor you here, played between\nJacques Tivillier and Chino\nNwachukwu. Annotations are\nprovided by International Master\nand professional chess coach and\ncommentator Thomas Rendle.\nWe look forward to hosting the\ncongress again when time allows,\nand are already planning the\nnext one. If you\u2019re interested in\nparticipating or you play chess and\nwould like to check out the club, we\nwelcome you with open arms and\nare always looking for new players!\nWe meet every week on campus\n(location next year TBC) and you\ncan get in touch by e-mailing chess@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nMany thanks to Appy Deshpande\n& Bob Yung from IC Chess who\nkept things well oiled with the\norganising team all weekend, as\nwell as James Lindsay & Darya\nShirobokova of ICU without whom\nthe event couldn\u2019t exist at our\nwonderful venue.\nAs a\ntestament\nto the\ncompetition\n2nd\nplace\nhad seven\npeople\nsharing\nJohn Sargent\nWriter\n1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Be7 8.Qf3 h6\n9.Bh4 Nbd7 10.0\u20130\u20130 g5 [Black lashes out on the kingside but this leaves his\nKing rather stranded in the centre.]\n11.fxg5 Ne5 12.Qe2\n[White could also have sacrificed his Queen at this point with the entertaining\n12.gxf6!

There\u2019s the age-old idea\nof fundamental research having\ninherent, non-monetary value\nas a social service - sort of like a\nlibrary, providing building blocks\nof knowledge we can all draw from.\nIncreasingly, however scientists are\nhaving to prove the financial value\nand the return-on-investment\nof their research in order to get\nfunding, much the way someone\ngetting a loan from a bank for, say, a\nstart-up cupcake stand does. When\nyou factor in the increasing amount\nof time scientists have to spend\nwith their hats-in-hands writing\ngrants, submitting proposals, \u2013 an\nincredible amount of our collective\nscientific brain capacity is spent\nthinking about how to acquire and\njustify sources of funding from\ndrying wells. Skilled researchers and\ntheir teams spend countless days,\nmonths, even years pandering to\nadministrative managers who often\nonly see a chart of red lines that\nneed to be converted to black.Many\nscientists claim upwards of 30% or\ngreater of their time is now taken\nup simply finding funds. This also\ndisproportionately affects younger\nresearchers who can\u2019t secure funding\nbased on their \u2018brand\u2019 the way more\nestablished scientists can.\nWhether we can blame recent\nausterity measures, or reach further\nback and point at shifts like the rise\nof neoliberalism decades ago, we\nshould regardless be considering the\nimpact of having scientific research\nfunding tightly intertwined with\neconomic drivers and determinants.\nSome fields or areas of science may\nhave obvious direct impacts that can\nNaomi Stewart\nWriter\nNational Science Foundation, funding source for 24% of all research conducted\nby America\u2019s universities and colleges which are federally supported.

How do you calculate the\nreturn-on-investment for 30 years-worth of data on water levels in the\nThames, or the discovery of a new\nspecies of moth in the Amazon?\nAmerican physicist Richard\nFeynman once argued that the three\nprimary values of science are: it\nenables us to do and make all kinds\nof things, it provides intellectual\nenjoyment in doing and thinking\nabout it, and it teaches us to remain\nunsure and in doubt. So how sure\nare we that the pursuit of scientific\nknowledge needs to be constantly\nweighted against economic\nmeasures?\nScience, what\u2019s good?\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\nO\nut of 2,501 members\nof the British public\nrecently surveyed by\nscientists from Cardiff\nUniversity\u2019s School of Psychology,\nonly twenty percent were aware\nof ocean acidification. The study,\npublished in the Nature Climate\nChange journal, is the first to assess\npublic understanding of the issue.\nThe study surveyed a representative\nsample of Britain, which is\nalarming. Dr Stuart Capstick says\nthat although they didn\u2019t expect to\nfind high levels of public awareness,\nthe extent of obliviousness amongst\nlaymen was surprising. Things\nbecome meta now; when subjects\nbecame aware of the percentage of\nunawareness there was a jump in\nconcern\u2026which then subsided once\nocean acidification was connected\nto climate change. Hm.\nCapstick et al. 2016 @ Nature\nClimate Change\nWhat ocean\nacidification?\nScientists have developed and\ntested a biofeedback system that\nuses the plants\u2019 physiological\nperformance to regulate lighting.\nThis new method may greatly\nreduce the energy cost of LED\nlighting, employed by controlled\nenvironment agriculture facilities,\nsuch as vertical farms. By measuring\nchlorophyll production and putting\nmeasurements through a datalogger,\nthey estimated the electron transport\nrate, which is a photosynthesis\nindicator. This allowed them to\ndetermine exactly how much light\nthe plants needed and modulate\nlighting accordingly. The datalogger\nin turn altered the duty cycle of the\nLED lighting source, optimizing\nthe process.The biofeedback system\ncan successfully maintain a wide\nrange of ETR (photosynthesis)\nvalues in different species, as well as\ntake into consideration light to heat\nconversions and chloroplast damage\nwhen making efficiency decisions.\nVan Irsel et al. 2016 @ J.

A number of\nstudies have since been published\nfor and against the Dyson sphere\nargument, the latest showing that\nprior evidence that proposed the\nstar had experienced a dimming\nof twenty percent, was in fact a\nresult of fading of the photographic\nglass plates that had been taken\nby Harvard astronomers between\n1885 and 1993. Still, even with\nthe twenty percent dimming taken\noff the table, Tabby\u2019s star remains\nhighly mysterious.

Regardless of whether\nyou\u2019ve used the moon\u2019s phases as\nan excuse for your behaviour, there\nis no scientific evidence to support\nthe idea that the full moon drive us\ncrazy,not even a little. That was until\na team of top scientists decided to\nrevisit this outdated notion.To avoid\nany social,economic or geographical\nbiases, they recorded sleep patterns\nof 5814 children, in twelve different\ncountries, spanning five continents,\nfor 28 months. This resulted in\na whopping 33,710 recordings\ncaptured by accelerometers strapped\nto the children\u2019s chests for the whole\ntime.\nBy cross-referencing these\nreadings to the phase of the moon,\nthe scientists came to the following\nstaggering conclusion (drumroll\nplease): The full moon alters sleep\npatterns in about 1% of cases. Lead\nscientist Dr. Jean-Philippe Chaput,\nfrom the Eastern Ontario Research\nInstitute said, \u201cOverall, I think we\nshould not be worried about the full\nmoon. Our behaviours are largely\ninfluenced by many other factors\nlike genes, education, income and\npsychosocial aspects rather than\nby gravitational forces.\u201d Cue sad\npacman sound of defeat.\nThis rather anticlimactic result\ndoes actually shed some light on\nan important phenomenon. In\nthe recent years, there has been\nincreased attention to what is called\nthe circadian clock. This internal\n\u2018clock\u2019 regulates how our body\nreacts at different times of the day,\nregulating functions such as\nhormone production, body\ntemperature and brain wave\nactivity. This clock reacts to\nexternal cues such as exposure\nto light and temperature, and\na more subtle understanding\nof circadian rhythms has\nallowed us, for instance, to\nsynchronise drug delivery with\nthe circadian clock and increase\ndrug efficiency and reduce\ntoxicity. As some animals have\nbeen known to have an internal\nclock which follows the lunar\ncycle, it is not unreasonable\nto evaluate whether humans\ncould be affected by the phases\nof the moon, and this research\nhelps us close the door on that\npossibility.\nGod dammit there\u2019s a full moon again\nPhoto Simon Thomas\n\n"

We\u2019ve seen\nsmartphones change the way we\nwatched porn, and VR is set to do\nthe same. While 3D porn itself\nis nothing new (it\u2019s been around\nfor decades), virtual reality porn\nis significant in that it is able to\nsimulate physical presence via a\ncombination of head tracking and\nstereoscopic vision. The porn set\nis now all encompassing and you\nbecome the porn star. No longer\nmerely the spectator, you are now a\nspectre in another person\u2019s body.\nPorn sites have been quick to react\nto the rise of virtual reality headsets,\nwith PornHub introducing a\nvirtual reality section on their\nwebsite earlier this year. Once an\ninaccessible oddity, VR porn is now\navailable to everyone for free. So, I\nguess I had to try it.\nTo transport yourself to another\nworld, first you have to leave your\nown reality. Unfortunately, head\nmounted displays completely\nseparateyoufromyoursurroundings,\nso if you\u2019ve ever been worried about\nsomeone bursting in and catching\nyou in the act, VR porn probably\nisn\u2019t for you. Not only will you\nlook like some sort of futuristic\nsex-addicted spaceman, but you\nprobably won\u2019t even be aware when\nsomeone does enter the room (and\nthat could be a little embarrassing).\nIgnoring all the potential awkward\nsituations that might occur, virtual\nreality porn is pretty rad.\nIt succeeds for a number of\nreasons.Remember those gimmicky\nin-your-face bits in 3D films? VR\nporn directors have taken note, and\nthis new genre of adult film consists\nentirely of scenes where you have\ndicks and tits dangled in front of\nyour face. Probably more interesting\nis how enclosing your face in a\nheadset makes everything feel far\nmore intimate than, say, watching\nthe same video on your phone or\ncomputer. There\u2019s no interactivity\n(yet), so, it\u2019s unlikely to replace sex\nVirtual reality porn is a game-changer\nanytime soon. In the meantime,\nit opens up a whole new range of\nexperiences and experiments to us.\nVirtual reality,from the beginning,\nhas been advertised as the ability\nto experience something as if it\nwere reality or from someone else\u2019s\nperspective. In the past, I\u2019d never\nbeen curious enough to watch porn\naimed at the opposite sex. However,\nthere\u2019s something incredibly\npowerful about experiencing sex,\nand presence, when the roles are\nreversed. If there was ever a reason\nto try VR porn this would be it.\nFor now, I expect virtual reality\nporn will remain nothing more than\nan intrigue. However, as technology\nadvances and display resolutions\nincrease, virtual reality has a good\nchance at replacing conventional\npornography. And once it\u2019s replaced\nthat, combine it with networking\ntechnologies, sex toys, weird AI\nsexbots and it might just replace sex\nitself.\nAnonymous\nWriter\nWe\u2019re all jealous of our friends at uni outside London\nW\nith exams finishing\nand the sun coming\nout, Imperial is a\nhive of frenzied\nsexual activity, as inhibitions are\nshed in anticipation of the long\nsummer break. But if you live in a\nshared room in halls, it strongly\nlimits the privacy available for the\nexciting sexual encounters that\nwe\u2019re all craving. Some of you may\nhave already worked out how to get\naround this, and for others this may\nbe a new problem. Anyway, here\u2019s\nsome advice for you to make the\nmost of the rest of the summer term.\n1. The scheduler\nMost roommates are pretty\nreasonable about giving you the\nroom for a few hours, providing\nthey\u2019re not still revising while\nyou\u2019re totally free. I\u2019ve known\nroommate pairs who\u2019ve negotiated\nalone time for sex, masturbation, or\neven Skyping home, so depending\non your relationship with your\nroommate, you don\u2019t necessarily\nneed to be completely honest with\nthem. Of course, this requires a\ndegree of organisation from you and\nyour partner.\n2. The inconsiderate\nYou could just go for it when\nyour roommate is out. Most people,\nupon returning to their room and\nfinding their roommate having sex,\nwill back out and find something\nelse to do for a little while, even\nif they are passive-aggressively\nHow to have sex in halls\nmessaging the kitchen whatsapp\ngroup complaining about it. Unless\nyou like being walked in on, pre-agreeing a warning signal is key,\neven if it\u2019s just a courtesy text or a\nsock on the doorknob. If you do like\nbeing walked in on, see tip number\nthree.\n3. The spontaneous\nThere are plenty of semiprivate spaces, both in halls and\nelsewhere on campus, that you\ncan sneak off too and enjoy each\nother\u2019s company. These vary from\nessentially private (lockable rooms)\nto risky (empty common rooms in\nthe middle of the night), and in\nmy experience, the acceptable level\nof risk is proportional to the level\nof horniness. A word of warning\nthough, particularly in halls, more\nof the public spaces have CCTV\nthan you\u2019d expect, and security may\nwell be watching you (Beit laundry\nroom, I\u2019m looking at you).\n4. The borrower\nIf you have particularly liberal\nfriends, you may find someone\nwilling to lend you their single room\nif they,say,go away for the weekend.\nYou may have to withstand some\ngood-natured ribbing, offer up\nbribes, Febreeze their room, and\nhopefully launder their sheets, but\nin exchange for that, you can enjoy\ngetting nasty in private.\n5. The exhibitionist\nOr you can just wait until your\nroommate falls asleep and then go\nat it. You have to be painfully quiet,\nand they may wake up and be a\nbit traumatised, but it\u2019s probably\nfair game \u2013 they\u2019ve definitely\nmasturbated when you\u2019ve been\nasleep before.\nYou look\nlike some\nsort of\nfuturistic\nsex-addicted\nspaceman\nThis guy looks like he\u2019s having a great time.

Photo Credit: Jurassic Park\nWhat makes a good GUM clinic?\nGetting tested can be a fun day out\nAnonymous\nWriter\nA\npparently I engage in\nrisky sexual behaviour.\nThis means that like the\ngood millennial I am,\nI have to periodically get tested to\nmake sure that I'm free from the\nnasties that make sex a little less\nfun and a little more infectious\n(and not in a good way). Although\nthere are many sexual health\nclinics in London, many of which\nare excellent and come with rave\nreviews (with a particular shout out\nto the Dean Street Clinic in Soho),\nmy personal preference is Imperial\nCollege's own Jefferiss Wing in St\nMary's Hospital.\nOne of the problems with walkin clinics is the unknown wait, but\nthe Jefferiss Wing offers you the\nopportunity to book a slot via text,\nalthough just walking in, I've never\nwaited an unreasonable amount of\ntime. And, from the moment you\nwalk in, to the moment you're seen,\nyou're kept pretty well updated on\nhow long you'll be waiting. To keep\nyou entertained, as well as college\nnetworks, there's free wifi (although\nYouTube is blocked, sadly).\nEverything in this clinic is\ncompletely anonymised. You're\nasked to give your name and address\nto the staff when you arrive, which\nis exchanged for an anonymised\npatient number that you'll be called\nby (make sure that you remember\nit, you'll want to have it if you\ncome back again). Although you\ncan theoretically lie about your\nname and address, nothing is\ntransferred to your primary medical\nrecords without your consent, and\nthe address dictates which local\nauthority they charge for the testing.\nOn arrival, you're asked whether\nyou're experiencing any symptoms,\nneed emergency treatments, or are\nthere for a check up, and based on\nthat you'll be put in line to see either\na doctor or a nurse. They also do\ncervical smears while you're there, if\nyou've been too lazy to get around to\nhaving one done with your regular\ndoctor.\nI've never seen anyone at this\nclinic, doctor or nurse, who wasn't\nkind,friendly,and non-judgemental,\nand who I didn't feel completely\ncomfortable with. You can tell that\nthe staff are genuinely passionate\nabout sexual health and disease\nprevention, and that they want to\nprovide the best patient care.\nThey'll quiz you in detail on\nyour partners within the last three\nmonths, and ask you some general\nquestions about longer term\nrisk factors. Regardless of your\ndesignated risk level (I was placed\nin the same risk group as men who\nhave sex with men for money,which\nis almost an achievement), they're\nincredibly thorough, and usually\noffer a full barrage of tests even if\nyou've only had protected sex with\none person one time.\nAlongside the usual tests and\ntreatments for chlamydia and\ngonorrhoea, the Jefferiss Wing lets\nyou opt in for on the spot hepatitis\nB vaccinations (as well as hepatitis\nA, if you've been rimming gay men,\nwhich I would recommend).There's\nsomething incredibly reassuring\nabout being immune to an incurable\ndisease, so if given the option, you\nshould definitely opt in.\nAs well as taking blood for more\nthorough testing, anyone worried\ncan also get immediate fingerprick\nHIV testing, which is a fairly\nunusual offer,but very helpful if,like\nme, you become convinced that you\nhave every transmittable infection\nthe moment you enter the clinic.\nOf course, this only tells you your\nstatus up to three months ago, so it's\nimportant to get this done regularly\nif you're worried. Luckily, they have\na system where you can skip the\nqueues and pop to another clinic\nupstairs for a quick pinprick test if\nthat's all you need.\nI think sexual health clinics are\na bit of a social equaliser. From\nthe teenage girls giggling and\nwhispering amongst themselves, to\nthe suited and booted city banker\ntype, you see all sorts of people, all\nthere for the same reason \u2013 they\nwant to have safe sex. While most\npeople probably spend their time\nwaiting making up stories about\nwhy each person is there, you'll find\nthat you completely forget all about\nthem the moment you leave.\nAnd before you leave, don't forget\nto take some free condoms. As well\nas the generic Mates condoms (the\nsame ones available at the Union\nReception, if you need any), if you\nask nicely, they'll give you some\nhigher quality condoms, usually\neither Durex or Skyn.\nWithin a week or so, you'll get\na text telling you either that your\nresults were all negative, or that you\nneed to call the clinic. They send\nthese results out as soon as they\nhave them from their in-house lab\n\u2013 once my friend got hers back the\nsame day. When I'm waiting for\nthis text, I tend to get a bit paranoid\nand make all sorts of declarations\nabout how I'd rather not know, if\nonly to spare this torture. However,\nI enjoy talking about my sex life,\nso evaluating my partners with\nsomeone who is qualified to offer\nadvice is a good day out in my book.\nEven if you don't, I think it is really\nimportant to get checked regularly,\nif not for your own health, then for\nthe safety of those you have sex with.\nOh, and you'll be pleased to know\nthat my last tests were totally clear.\nIf you ask\nnicely,\nthey'll give\nyou some\nhigher\nquality\ncondoms\nDon't these look like people you'd want to stick a speculum up your foof?
