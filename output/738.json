    "content": "In some respects it seems a little odd that University\nStudents, of all people,\nshould be thought to need\na range of support services\nwhich are more\ncomprehensive, better\nstaffed and more accessible\nthan those available to their\npeer group outside.\nVirtually all universities\nhave an extensive medical\nservice, staffed by doctors\nand nurses who put a high\nvalue on talking to their\npatients-hardly an image of\ngeneral practice which\nwould be recognisable to\nthe consumers of National\nHealth Service medicine in\nthe country at large. Most\nuniversities have well\nstaffed student services\nunit where practical advise\nand help are available on\ndemand, and where\nstudents can expect\nassistance and sometimes\nadvocacy in their dealings\nwith bureaucracy. Most\nuniversities, including this\none, have appointed\nCounsellors whose brief, in\nessence, is an open-ended\ncommit t ment to helping\nstudents with personal\nproblems. Again the\ncontrast with the world\noutside academia is very\ngreat. How can we justify\nthis in e quit ble allocation of\nscarce resources in favour\nof most articulate,\nintelligent, and able sector\nof the school leaving\npopulation.\nAnother way of phrasing\nthe question perhaps, is\nthis\u2014What is so special\nabout University students?\nThere are two sorts of\nanswers I believe. The\nj more tendentious and value\n| laden one in voles the\nj economic argument that\nUniversity entrants are\nthemselves a scarce\nresources and that as an\nadvanced the ch no logy based society we are fully\njustified, even obliged, to\nafford them extra support\nand protection. This view,\n(of higher educational\nprovision generally) is\nenthusiastically embraced\nby the middle classes, and\nis compliant ly tolerated by\nthe working classes. The\nother sort of answer, and\nthe one I am most\ninterested in, concerns the\npeculiar nature of a students occupation, that is\nsustained, systematic and\nhigh level learning, and the\ninteraction, between the\nlearning process and\nanxiety, distress and other\nemotional disturbances. I do not believe that on the\nwhole the contingent life '\nproblems that student have\nto cope with are\nsignificantly different to\nthose of the rest of their\nage group-indeed it can\nreasonably be supposed\nthat they will not, on\naverage, be as bad. To be\nsure there are some\noccupational hazards which\nare associated with the\nintellectual high flyer, for\nOther common, but less\nobvious sources of distress\nand anxiety may also\nundermine the capacity to\nstudy in a highly insidious\nway.\nFor example, the student\nwho finds it difficult to\nmake friends, or who feels\nStudent Counsellor\nexample academic\nexcellence may have to be\nattained partly at the cost\nof the neglect of other sorts\nof skills, particularly social\nskills, and it may be true\nalso that some kinds of\nstress, in se per able from\nuniversity study are not\nrisks to which non students\nare exposed.\nThe residual, but solid,\njustification for professional\nhelping services in\nuniversit es is the degree to\nwhich the students central\nactivity-study-is impaired\nby factors which would be\nfar less disabling in terms\nof eff ice n cy for another\npersons whose occupation\nwas serving in a shop,\ndigging holes in the road or\nworking behind a bank\ncounter, A bereavement, a broken love relationship, or\na parental divorce, is\nequally traumatic for\nevey r one, and the\nimmediate emotional\nimpact is precisely the\nsame. For the university\nstudent however, and\nparticularly perhaps for\nstudents at Colleges like\nthis, where the work is\ncumulative and sequential,\neven a relative ley short\nperiod of distress related\ninefficiency can have a quite disproportionate\neffect.\nin other ways out of step\nwith what he perceives as\nnormal, may find some of\nthe more mechanical tasks\nassociated with his work\nquite easy to cope with, but\nfind it virtually impossible\nto sit and concentrate on\nwork that requires abstract\nthinking. 'I can't concentrate', 'my mind\nwanders off onto other\nthings'; 'I spend hours just\nlooking at my notes, taking\nnothing in'; are phrases\nwhich are very familiar to\nthose whose job it is to\nhelp students.\nThe individual colouring\nof this sort of study\nproblem can be infinitely\nvaried, but in practise there\nare some well recognised\npatterns into which most\npeople fit quite easily.\nBesides the sort of\nproblems already\nmentioned\u2014the fracture or\nthreat to key relationships,\nand the difficulties\nengendered by isolation\nand the fears associated\nwith it-l have in mind such\nproblems as anxieties\nabout one's choice of\ncourse, and possibly about\nthe next move in life, now\nthat all the more or less\nprescribed ones are at an\nend. Coping with the\ncompetitiveness in\nacademic work and\nlearning to recognise their\nappropriateness or\notherwise of level of degree\none hopes to achieve.\nCoping with the emotional\ndemands of other students\nand friends and finding\nsome sort of forum la for\ndealing with the more\nnegative aspects of human\nbehaviour. There are also\nthe mundane worries about\nmoney and\naccommodation, about the\nplanning of one's time and\nthe need to recognise the\ntime and energy are finite\nresources and that\ninvidious choices have to\nbe made.\nThere is no doubt that for\nall these sorts of difficulty,\nand many others, there is\nmuch to be said for talking\nto someone about them.\nPeople generally, but\nscientists and technologists\nparticularly perhaps, tend\nto underestimate the simple\nvalue of talking. Many of\nus, at times of difficulty\nalmost automatically turn in\non ourselves-particular y out of pride (the powerful\nimpulse to keep up an\nappearance of\ncompetence), and partly\nout of the inappropriate\nrational argue ment that\ntalking cannot change hard\nreality, cannot alter the\nsubstantive roots of our\nunhappiness, cannot alter\n'the facts'.\nTalking is important and\neffective however in a number of ways. Firstly it\nenables people to express,\nand therefore to ventilate\ntheir (often angry) feelings.\nProviding this is done in\nthe right sort of setting,\nand with the right sort of\nresponse, it helps to\nliberate the energy required\nto tackle real life difficulties\nconstructively. Secondly it\nis often only by taking\nabout things that we are\nable to sort out one strand\nfrom another and make\nsome sort of coherent\npicture of the situation.\nThirdly, this more or less\nconscious sharing of\nfeelings may very well lead\nto new ideas, new\ninformation, new initiatives\nfor tackling problems.\nThere are many people in\nCollege to whom students\ncan talk-colleagues and\nfriends of course, but also\ncollege staff-tutors,\ndoctors, student services\nstaff. You can also talk to\nme. I am not paid to do\nanything else, and my work\nis entirely confidential. If\nyou would like to see me,\nmy office is in the\nbasement of 15, Princes\nGardens, and my telephone\nno is 3041.\n10 Friday 2 May FELIX\n\n"

To my\nembarrassment Mobius\nappeared the next day\nsaying that I had made a mistake and one of my\nclues must be wrong. He\nwas right, of course, but in\nchecking I noticed\nsomething interesting.\n'Ah, but if you take the\nincorrect clue to mean the\nexact opposite of what it\nsays, then there is a unique\nsolution', I said . With this\nnew information in hand he\nwent away to solve the\nproblem.\nSo what is the solution,\nand which clue is incorrect\n(NB I consider 1 to be a prime number)? Solutions,\ncomments etc, to the FELIX\noffice by Wednesday\nlunchtime for the \u00a35 prize,\nplease.\nSQL\nL_\nDOWN\n1) A prime number.\n3) All digits are prime and\nadd to give 9.\n4) A cube.\n6) Digits ascending.\n9) All digits the same.\n10) Square root of 4 down.\nACROSS2) All digits different.\n5) A square.\n7) Sum of the digits of 2\nacross.\n8) Difference between first\nand last digits equals\ndifference between middle\ntwo.\n10) Digits of 8 across\nrearranged.\n11) A factorial of the first\ndigit of 1 down.\nShagar's sheep-solution\nThere can only be 19\nsheep.It's possible to\narrange 18 and 20 sheep so\nthat there are 5 or 9 on\neach side, but it requires\nhaving either all or none of\nthe sheep in overlapping\nareas, which wasn't allowed. Lots of a nws ers to\nthis one, so you obviously\nfound it quite easy. Two\npossible arran gm ents are\nshown below.\n4\nI45J54\\1 V414J The winner was Alison\nPerkins, Chem Eng 3. You\ncan collect your \u00a35 after\n1.00pm on\nMonday.Baaaaaah!\nA cable of cables\nSeveral people entered\ncorrect solutions to this (or\nsolutions that were so\nnearly correct that I counted them). There were\ntwo basic solutions both of\nwhich I 've explained. The\nan w ser is that all the cables\ncan be correctly labelled in\none journey to the end and\nback (unless there are only\ntwo cables, in which case\nthe problem is impossible).\nI'm sure those of your who\nhad him travelling\nlog(x)/ log(2) etc times\nalong the cable will\nappreciate the an w ser. The first solution varies\ndepending on whether the\ncable contains an odd or\neven number of wires. The\nversion for an odd number\nis described, with va rations for an even number in\nbrackets afterwards.\nStarting at the site we shall\ncall the 'Home' site join the\nwires together in pairs but\nleave one (two) wires\nunconnected. This (These)\nwill be referred to as the\nalpha wire (the alpha and\nbeta wires, though we don't yet know which is which).\nNow travel to the other site,\nwhich we shall refer to as\nthe 'field'. Using the battery\nand bulb it is easy to find\nthe alpha wire (the alpha\nand beta wires) because it\nis (they are) the only ones\nnot connected to anything.\nLabel this wire as the alpha\nwire (Label either wire\nalpha, the other beta).\nWe can also pair off the\nother wires, labelling them\narbitrarily as 1a and 1b,2a and 2b,3a and 3b,... na and\nnb. Each a is connected to\nthe corresponding b at the\nhome site, of course.\nNow disc one ct1a. Connect\n1 b to 2a,2b to 3a3b to\n4a,...(n1) b to na, and nb to\nalpha. Leave 1a( and beta)\ndisco nec ted. Back to the home site,\nwhere the alpha wire is\nalready labelled (where the\nalpha beta wires are\nlabelled, and we can soon\nfind which is which since\nalpha is cone c ted to\nsomething while beta isn't). Disconnect all the wires at\nthe home site (but\nremember how they were\nconnected). Using the\nbattery and bulb, find\nwhich wire is connected to\nalpha at the field site. This\nis nb. The wire which was\nconnected to nb (at the\nhome site) is na. The wire\nconnected to na (at the\nfield site) is (n1)B. The\nwire which was cone nc ted to (n1)b( at the home site)\nis (n1)a. Hence, by\nchaining the wires in this\nway, all of them can be\nlabelled in only two\njourneys between the ends\nof the cable.\nThe second solution is as\nfollows. At the 'home' site\nconnect together the wires\nin groups with ascending\nnumbers of wires, starting\nat one, until the remaining\nno of wires is not enough\nto form the next group (ie\ngroups of 1,2,3,4,...n wires).\nCall the largest group in\nthe ascending series n, and\nthe number of remaining\nwires m. Form these\nremaining wires into a group unless m is equal to\nn, in which case leave one\nwire unconnected (call this\nthe 'free' wire) and form a group of m1 wires.\nNow travel to the far site.\nUse the battery to identify\nthe groups. Lable the wires\nin the ascending groups 1a,2a,2b,3 a,3b,3c,... etc. Label\nthe m( or m1) group ma*, mb*...etc so as to\ndifferentiate it from the\nascending group of the\nsame size. Now connect\nwire 1a to all the other 'a' wires. Then connect 2b to\nall the other 'b' wires, 3c to\nall the other 'c' wires, etc.\nContinue like this, except\nleave one wire of the m( or\nm1) group unconnected.\nThere will also be one wire\nof the n group\nunconnected.\nNow go back to the 'home'\nsite. Disconnect the wires\nbut remember what groups\nthey were in. If there was a 'free' wire it can easily be\nfound since it is the only\nunconnected wire in a group of 1. Now find which\nwires are connected to the\nfirst wire in the ascending\nseries, these will be the\n2a,3a,4a,... etc. The wire left\nun lab led in the group of 2\nwill be 2b, and the wires\nconnected to this will be\n3b,4b,... etc. Carry on until\nall the wires are labelled.\nThe m( or m1) group can\nbe differentiated by the fact\nthat it's last wire is\nunconnected.\nWell done to all of you who\nattempted a solution and\ncongratulations if you got it\nright. The winner was M Turnbull, Physics 3. You\ncan pick up your \u00a35 prize\nafter 1pm Monday.\nUIUUQUQ3UJ\nFELIX Friday 2 May 11\n\n"

The B side to Laurie |\nAnderson's 'Oh Superman'\nsingle is ?\nTiebreaker\u2014I like Laurie\nAnderson because\nWet Dreams. Simon Lewis looks at the latest from the Donmar.\nSwim Visit by Wesley Moore,\n(The Donmar Warehouse\nuntil May 17th) Swim Visit is set in a small\nIllinois town in the midWest of the USA. It deals\nwith the relationships and\ninterrelationships of four\npeople on what at first\nappears to be a lazy\nafternoon around the pool\nin early Summer. Swim\nVisit is well worth seeing.\nThroughout the play the\ncast maintained an\noppressive intensity.\nInitially this appeared to be\ndue entirely to Izz, a manic\ndepressive who switched\nfrom anger and tears to\nlaughter, often during the\ncourse of a sentence.\nPatricia Elliott gave a fine\nperformance, and at times,\nthe way she conveyed inner\npain felt too real, as she\ntried continuously to fill her\n'silences'. However her well\ndevised larger-than-life\ntraumas did not blot out\nthe other characters and it\nbecame increasingly\napparent that her husband\nTed, was also plagued with\nlife's problems. Whether the\nroots of Izz and Ted's suffering was ultimately\ndue to their relationship, or\nto more external factors,\nwas one of the questions\nleft to the audience to\ndecide.\nThe other two characters,\nBeth and Clay, seemed\nrelatively unscathed. Beth,\na younger friend of Izz's was recently widowed,\nwhile Clay, a 'College boy',\nwas employed as a foremen\nat the fibreglass tray\nfactory owned by Ted. Clay\nbetrayed very little of his\ninner feelings and\nmaintained a certain\ndistance as he tried, in\nvain, to explain the\nimminent collapse of the\nfactory and the likely action\nof the employees to Ted,\nwho appeared withdrawn\nand unable to care. Clay's relationship with the two\nwomen was very sexual,\nappropriately illustrated\nwhen Beth commented: 'Oh\nClay...what beautiful\nvegetables!', while staring\nat his genitals!\nThe play's involvement\nand strong allusion to\nwater, traditionally a life\ngiving force, which occured\nas a recurring theme,\nseemed to suggest that Izz\nand Ted's relationship was\nin some way incomplete\nand fruitless. This imagery\nwas a particularly\ncompelling feature of the\nplay as a whole. Ted spoke\nof the factory he had set\nup, his lifes achievement\nas: '...my baby...' but later\nshouted that: 'This\ncompany has ruined my\nlife'; while Izz told Ted:\n'You are a dried up piece of\nskin...' They both seemed\nto yearn for some kind of\n'real' child, or life giving\nforce, and the lack of this\nmay have been the reason\nwhy they appeared to be\ndrowning in their own\nseparate obsessions. As\nClay commented to Beth:\n'They are both off in their\nown little world'. The\ninevitable destruction of\nTed's factory coupled with\nthe lack of achievement of\nIzz's life, smacked of their\ndesire, un attained, for\nimmortality.\nIncreasingly, Beth and\nClay became sucked into\nIzz and Ted's scheme of\nthings, and in the end it\nseemed that what had\nstarted as an afternoon\naround the pool, might\ncontinue endlessly, for all\ntime.\nA simple non-naturalistic\n'pool-side' area, bathed in\nlight, jutting out into the\nsur rou on ding audience\ncreated a feeling of\nlethargy and warmth which\nwas in stark contrast to the\naction taking place,\nen h acing it. Two\ndeck chairs formed the\ncore, around which were\nlarge oddly shaped green\nobjects. These were later\nrevealed to be an attempt\nat topiary. Changes in the\nmood and time of day were\nachieved by a number of\nlighting effects.\nSwim Visit was\ntechnically simple. This did\nnot interfere with the words\nand actions which spoke\nfor themselves, admirably.\nI was left feeling excited\nand stu mula ted. John Sessions at the\nEleventh Hour\nThe Donmar Warehouse,\n11pm Fridays and\nSaturdays only, to the 17th May (Bar until 1.30pm) John Sessions one person\nshow is extremely funny.\nThe humour ranged from\nthe obscure to the\nridiculous and yet managed\nto entertain throughout.\nThe energy generated by\nthis man, coupled with his\nsharp dialogue, which\nranged from the plight of\noral bacteria to impressions\nof Tina Turner, kept the\npacked house on the edge\nof their seats.\nThe only fault was one of\njudging where the line\nbetween humour and\nprejudice should lie, and\nthere were a few occasions\nwhen the line was crossed,\nbut that is a matter for the\nindividual to decide.\nFELIX Friday 2 May 9\n\n"

According to\nsources, Mr Smith was\nseen 'strut ing his funky\nstuff' on the dance floor\nwhile the new sabbatical\nwas playing piano.\nDave Kingston spent the\nfirst week of the Easter\nholidays lounging around\nat the National Student\nServices Organisation\nfreebie in Newcastle. While\nhe was away, though,\ncertain 'friends' thought\nthat his absence would be\nan ideal opportunity to\nredecorate his office.\nUnfortunately for Mr\nKingston, his friends had\nrather unusual ideas about\noffice design. They\nremoved all the furniture\nand replaced it with a paddling pool full of home\nbrew, urine nad stale water.\nPerhaps with friends like\nthat you'll understand why\nenormous amounts of\nmoney were raised for Mr\nKingston to be thrown in\nthe mud.\nStudents at College Hall,\nthe exclusively female\ninter-collegiate hall, are\nsaid to have organised last\nterm a strip show for the\nedification and\nentertainment of its\noccupiers and presumably,\ntheir guests too. The\norganisers suggested that it\nwould comprise of a single\nmale stripper.\nThe warden of the hall,\nwho was described by one\nof the residents as being\nsenile, gave her consent for\nthis project. In addition,\nthere were no calls, or\nhints, from any group to\norganise a protest against\nor a picket at the event.\nThe latter tactic was\nsucces fully employed, just\nover a year ago, against the\nMine's Hon Porn Night; the\nshow was forced to be\nabandoned, although\nanother has since been\nheld.\nOne of the organisers of\nthe event at College Hall\nwas also apparently a leader of the picket at\nImperial College.\nCollege Hall denied\norganising the event but\nadmitted that any of their\nstudents could have held\nsuch a party at the Hall\nprivately.\nThe College Masonic\nLodge were most upset atthe recent issue of Feelsick\nthat described Dave\nKingston as a mason.\nApparently they held an\ninquiry into who leaked the\nstory. Well boys we're not\nsaying who it was who told\nus but it's not who you\nthink it is.\nFinally, Carl Burgess has\nbeen making his merry way\nround College pissing on\npeople's beds. This week\nthe lucky recipients of a 'sample' from Carl are Pete\nHartley and Eleanor\nMalcolm. FELIX will give a small prize to anyone who\nguesses correctly which\nbeds Carl will piss in next\nFalmouth Keogh Hall\nSubwarden/Assistant Subwarden\nApplications are Invited for the above posts\nwhich become vacant In September 1986. Both\npost offer rent-free ac como dati on In return for\nduties which Include assisting the Warden with\nthe day to day running of the Hall. The\nsuccesful applicant will probably be a postgraduate student although others will be\nconsidered.\nApplications should be made In writing to\nthe warden, Dr P Jowltt by Monday 19th May.\nMoney's Too\nTight To\nMention\nIn late 1984 one of the hundreds of odd little committees\nin the University of London set up a working party to\nconsider student accommodation needs. One of the first\ndecisions taken by this working party was to commission\na survey into the difficulties and problems of student\naccommodation in London, covering topics such as what\nkinds of halls of residence are preferred, how much\npeople are willing and able to pay, travelling times etc.\nExternal Affairs Officer Gren Manuel has looked through\nthe result.\nThis document is now\nlying on my desk. It's big:\nthere's no need for a survey\nto discover that. It has 84\naccommodation'. However\nmuch of the information\nwhich can be distilled from\nthe report is s uprising, and\nGren Manuel: alarmed that low incomes are getting lower\nand high rents are getting higher\npages of complex\nnumber speak, and is\nprobably the most\ncomprehensive work on\nthis subject ever. Some of\nthe data is irrelevant to\nstudents at our particular\nhallowed institution, and\nthe occasional figure seems\nto have been included more\nout of interest than\nimportance. (Did you know\nthat on average\npostgraduates spent 27p more on lunch than\nundergraduates?)\nNevertheless this pile of\npaper represents a significant commitment by\nthe University to tailoring\nit's accommodation policy\nto the needs and\npreferences of those who it\nis supposed to serve.\nMany of the points made\nare intuitive, Jout still it is\nuseful to have this intuition\nbacked by the certainty of\nstatistics. For example the\nreport says that 'living in\nprivately rented\nac como dati on is associated\nwith a high expenditure on\nsome of it may come as\nuncomfortable news to\nsome.\nIncome: One of the tables\nshows total yearly income\nbroken down by faculty,\nshowing how income is\nrelated to the subject of\nstudy. Interestingly there is\na lot of difference between\nfaculties, with engineers\naveraging \u00a33414 for the\nentire year 1984/5 and\nscientists only \u00a32743, with\nthe difference presumably\nbeing accounted for by\nsponsorships and better-paid summer jobs. 30% of\nthose in receipt of an LEA grant received the full\namount, and of those who\nwere assessed for a parental contribution 80%\nreceived it in full. Of those\nwho didn't more than half\nwere \u00a3200 short, and one in\nfive more than \u00a3600 short.\n25% of those eli gable for\ngrant reported delays or\ndifficulties in getting it.\nSome form of state\nbenefit is claimed by 25%\nof students, mostly housing\nFriday 2 May FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "INCOST 86\nby Luke Walker\nCarl Burgess and I spent\nlast term in Ghent,\nBelguim, as the English\ndelegation to the annual\nInternational Conference of\nStudents in Technology. I hope in this article to give\nsome details about this\nevent, and some of my\nreactions to it. I am not\nsetting out to justify the\nmoney that ICU spent on\nsending us to it, other than\nthat I have it on good\nauthority that the sum\ninvolved in sending both of\nus to Belgium is very\nsimilar to what it costs the\nUnion to send one delegate\nto the NUS/National\nStudents Services\nOrganisation confer n ce in\nNewcastle earlier this year.\nAlso, I should perhaps\nremind students that the\nwork the Union does in\nrepresent a ting their\ninterests, ie Academic\nAffairs, is a very low budget\narea of the Union's activity\n(in C&GI receive no\nspecific allocation of\nfunding.)\nINCOST was attended by\ndelegations from most\nnorthern European\ncountries; Scotland,\nNorthern Ireland, England,\nSweden, Norway, Finland,\nHolland, Belguim, Poland,\nand also students from\nYugoslavia and the United\nStates. There was a total of\nabout 40 students, in\naddition to other local\nGhent students who\norganised the conference.\nWe spent five days going\nthrough a very full and\nheavy schedule of lectures\nby senior Belgian\nindustrialists and other\nworkshops, discussion\nsession, visits to local\nfactories, and visits to other\nsites of interest around\nGhent. One of the most\ninteresting visits was a tour\nof the new harbour\nconstruction site at\nZeebrugge.\nThe theme of the\nconference was\nmanagement and\nengineering, so many of\nthe lectures were given by\nengineers who had been\nsuccesful in man ag ment and commerce-including a venture capitalist. He\nclaimed that there is plenty\nof money available to\nengineers who wish to set\nup their own company-the\nproblems is having a good\nidea to develop. We were\nalso given lectures about\nthe other end of the\nspectrum; multinational\ncompanies such as Volvo\nand the Royal Dutch Shell\nGroup.\nHaving attended\nINCOST, I would strongly\nrecommend that ICU\ncontinues to send\ndelegates to it. Obviously, it\nis not easy to point to\nspecific ways in which this\nwill be of direct and\nimmediate benefit to IC\nstudents. However it is a very useful forum for the\nexchange of views between\nstudents of different\nnations, and I learnt a lot\nSummer Dinner\nThursday, 29 May 1986\n7pm for 7.30pm Sherfield Building\nMenu\nChilled Avacado Soup Brown Bread and Butter\nChicken and Prawns Imperial\nBasmati Rice with Mushrooms and Celery\nSummer Pudding with Cream\nCheeseboard\nCoffee\nCost Student Rate: \u00a39.00 (\u00a34.00 subsidy)\nStaff Rate: \u00a311.00 (\u00a32.00 subsidy)\nincluding wine\nNames to Pat in the Union by 22nd May\n12\nabout the students\norganisations and\nengineering education\nsystem of other countries. I think that many English\npeople tend to neglect the\nimportance of the countries\n(particularly where English\nis not the first language) to\nwhat we do here. We can\nand should take\nopportunities to learn from\neach other. A specialist\nconference for technology\nstudents is a very useful\nforum, since co-operation\nbetween nations in\nindustrial, economic and\ntechnological development\nis becoming more common.\nI enjoyed my time at\nIncost, and am grateful to\nCouncil for agreeing to\nsend Carl and myself. I feel\nthat both Carl and I made\ngood use of the\nopportunity presented to us\nto make friends with\nstudents from other\ncountries (this was assisted\nby them speaking English!),\nand I hope to visit some of\nthe contacts I made in the\nfuture.\nIf any students wish to\nfind out more in detail of\nwhat Carl and I did and\nlearned and discussed at\nthe conference, you are, of\ncourse, welcome to ask.\nAnd in case anyone\nthought that we went to the\nconference to drink\nexcessive volumes of\nalcohol, I didn't drink any\n(being the token nonalcoholic on the C&G Exec,\nas many people already\nknow!) and in my view, Carl\nbehaved himself very well.\nIt was commented several\ntimes by other delegates\nthat Carl and I are very\ndifferent people-so we\ncould try to give the\nimpression that IC students\naren't all the same-but the\nway in which we both\napproached INCOST, ie\nseriously, was one\nsimilarity.\nLuke Walker\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nCity and Guilds Union.\nINCOST 86\nby Carl Burgess\nTopic:\nEntrepreneurship in\nEngineeing, Industrial\nManagement\nAlthough the conference\nwas primarily about these\nmatters we gained a lot of\ninformation gained about\nhow Universities are set up\nin other countries; in\nparticular and workings of\nthe grants systems in the\nEuropean countries, how\nlong their courses are, what\noptions are available to\nthem, what they are\nactually taught and how\ntheir courses compare to\nours.\n1 The Loan System\nEven though most\ncountries used the loan\nsystem many of them\napproximated to grants\nbecause if you could not\npay the loan back you did\nnot have to. In other\ncountries they had a system where by the loan\nhad to paid off by your\n50th birthday at a standard\n4% interest rate per year\nwhich would not change\nwith inflation. Others had\npartial loan/grant system\nbut none had the system\nthat made their parents pay\nfor their childrens' higher\nedu ation if they earned\nmore than a certain figure.\n2 Course Length Most\ncourses weer four years\nlong but here\"was a a general trend ot increasing\nthe lengths fo the courses\nto four and half years or\neven five years.\nThe reasons for this can\nbe seen from the fact that\nthey all do two years of\ngeneral scientific study\nwith a emphasis on\nmath emetics and then they\nbranch out at the point to\nspecialise in the fields that\ninterest them, such as\nEnergy Technology or\nEngineering Physics (as\nthey like to call it. This\npoints to a high degree of\nspecial is ation in a particular field at the actual\nUniversity which is not\navailable here (even if it\nwere desirable)\nThere seems to be\ngreater flexibility within the\nother European systems to\nenable students to find out\nwhat they are suited for.\n3 Non Technical Options\nAnother factor ;\nn the\nlengths of the courses are\nthe number of nontechnical options available\nfor the students to study. A high emphasis is placed on\nthe planing of mange rial skills, economic theory,\nforeign language study,\nand the social aspects of\ntechnology.\nI have decided not to\ninclude a detailed report of\nwhat the actual program of\nevents were organised as\nLuke has already written\none of his long and verbose\nrecitations.\nCarl Burgess\nIC President\nFriday 2 May FELIX\n\n"

It is just over a month until the first of a multitude of groups that\nconstitute the festival are\nexpected to being heading\nfor the Wiltshire site and as\n; yet there is still little sign of\n1\nagreement about the\nstaging of a prolonged\nfestival. Thus it was r fears of\n' a repeat of last years\nI controversial police action\n| which seemed to dominate\n:\ndebate.\nThe meeting was chaired\nby Alex Rosenberger, a j journalist, who, it appeared,\nI was acting as spokesman\nfor a number of diverse\nI organs at ions representing\nthe various aspects of the\nfestival. Looking the\nepi to my of a young\ni Thatcherite executive\nrather than a hippy, Mr\nI Rosenberger introduced in\n; turn Brig Outbridge of\n| Green C ND; Don Aitken of\nFestival Welfare Services;\nSid Rawle much reported in\nthe media as a leading\nfestival goer; George Smith\na resident of Shrewton\nwhich is near Stonehenge\nand Willy X of the\nPolytantric Cirle who have\nlong been involved in the\norganisation of free\nfestivals all over Britain. It\nwas pointed out that those\npresent were acting as a voice for large numbers of\nsmall groups and that it\nwas these large numbers\nacting individually who\nwould congregate at the\nancient stones during the\nJune solstice. All present\nwere careful to emphasis\nthat they were not\norganisers in the normal\nsense and that they would\nbe unable to prevent a considerable number of\npeople from trying to\ncelebrate this year's solstice.\nA campaign of pickets,\nmarches and lobbying was\noutlined culminating in an\nadvance on the festival site\nfrom several directions\nbefore the solstice. A mass\nlobby of MPs is planned for\nThursday May 29th. Those\nactually involved in\norganising actions were at\npains to emphasise the\nnon-violent nature of their\nplanned action. One tactic\nspecific aly mentioned was\nthe holding of\ndemonstrations in Salisbury\ntown centre (including a 'naked protest') where it\nwas believed the police\nwere less likely to employ\na gres sive control methods.\nIn addition it is hoped\ncoordinated action at the\nGreenham Common USAF\nbase will divert police from\nthe Stonehenge area.\nOne item of considerable\ncontention was the\naccusation by the National\nTrust that the festival has\nresulted in considerable\narche a logical damage.\nIndependant arche aol ogi sts were cited as saying that\nthe festival is insignificant\nin comparison to both the\nmillions of tourists who\nvisit the popular monument\nand the activities of the\narmy on Salisbury Plain. It\nwas also pointed out that\nincompetent use of\nbulldozers by the police\nduring last years actions\ndid ir repairable damage to\nancient mounds.\nWarren Davis a spokesman for the National\nTrust said that they hoped\nto reduce damage to their\nland from all possible\ncauses but was unable to\nelaborate exactly what that\nwould entail. He also\nadmitted that the\nemployment last year of a Mr Les Vaughan to provide\nprivate security on behalf\nof the local landowners had\nbeen a serious mistake and\nthat the National Trust had\nissued instructions that no\nsuch measures were to be\ntaken this year. Les\nVaughan is a figure known\nto organisations monitoring\nthe activities of radical\nrightwing groups and has a number of convictions for\nserious crimes.\nA spokesman from the\nEnglish Heritage Trust\nstated that they would be\nprepared to allow limited\naccess to the site of the\nstones as long as the\nquestion of a campsite\ncould be resolved. English\nHeritage control the actual\nmonument area only and\nseemed to be talking in\nterms of limiting numbers\nat the stones to a couple of\nthousand on the basis that\nthis is all that the area\ncould reasonably hold.\nHowever the problem of\na site on which people\ncould camp and on which\nthe customary rock\nconcerts could occur\nseems as far from solution\nas ever. The parties\nconcerned have indicated\ntheir willingness to accept\nas a site almost anywhere\nin the general region,\nhowever those control ing the land remain\nintransigent about the\nlikelihood of a large\nnumber of people arriving\nin June. Don Aitken of\nFestival Welfare Services\nwho are a charitable trust\nconcerned with the welfare\nof participants at all types\nof outdoor festivals,\nexpressed dismay at the\nlack of compromise so far.\nHe stated that the majority\nof festival goers would be\nclassified by most people\nas quite normal and not the\nsmall bunch of freaks they\nare portrayed as in the\nmedia. He went on to state\nthat no matter what\nhappened he believed a large number of people\nwould try to reach the\nstones in June.\nA major part of the\ncampaign announced by\nAlex Rosenberger is the\nlaunch of a magazine\ncalled Festival Eye which\nwill sell for 70p and is\naimed at promoting a more\ncoordinated image than\nprevious years. It is hoped\nthat the campaign, which\nlists amoung its supporters\nthe Greenpeace\norganisation, will press u rise the author ies via the media\ninto resuming negotiations\nfor a compromise festival.\nFrom the legal point of\nview it is intended to\ncontest injunctions being\nsought against a list of\nabout 50 people which will\nprohibit them from the\nStonehenge area. The\ncases will be heard on May\n13th at the High Court in\nthe Strand. Festivalgoers\nare also investigating the\npossibility of taking legal\naction against the chief\nconstable of Wiltshire to\nsafeguard their right of\nlawful passage on the\npublic highways as they\nnow believe that the police\noverstepped the bounds of\ntheir powers in stopping\npeople outside last years\ninjunction area.\nFurthermore it was noted\nthat the new wide ranging\npublic order act will not\nbecome law until well after\nthe proposed festival.\nFestival Eye will be\navailable from The\nPolytantric Circle, 99\nTorriano Avenue, Camden.\nAmong the events leading\nup to Stonehenge will be a festival at East Wyke Farm,\nOxford on the 3rd May (this\nweekend) featuring\npsych a deli c bands\nincluding Dr and the\nMedics and Zodiac\nMindwarp.\n14 Friday 2 May FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The Week In Science\nTime Out Meets Tomorrow's World\nNew Anti-Cancer\nTherapies By\nThe 1990's? British biotechnology\ncompany Celltech has\nannounced an agreement with\nthe Cyanamid Chemical .group\nto develop new anti-cancer\ntherapies.\nThe problem with chemical\ntherapies for cancer is that the\ndrugs used are often\nextremely toxic. The dose\nrequired to kill the cancer\ncells would also be sufficient\nto kill the patient-rather\ncounterproductive.\nWhat is required is some\nway of getting large quantities\nof cytotoxic agents (drugs to\nsuppress cell reproduction) to\nthe tumour, without circulating\nthroughout the body.\nThis is where mono cl on al antibodies (mab s) come in.\nAntibodies are part of the\nbody's defence system. They\nbind selectively to organisms\nthat 'invade' the body. To\nexploit the specificity of\nantibodies, large quantities of\nsingle, pure antibodies,\ndirected against a single\ninvader, are required. This is\nwhat mab s are.\nThe Celltech cancer therapy\nis based on selection mab s that are specific for cancer\ncells, and then using the mab s to carry drugs to the tumour.\nIn theory you could then\nadminister large dose of quite\ntoxic drugs, without serious\nside effects. Already,\nradioisotopes are being\ndirected into tumours using\nmab s, to image the tumour,\nand show it size and shape.\nBut a limitation of mab s so\nfar has been their load-carrying capacity. When they\nare load with enough drug to\nkill the cancer cells , they have\ntended to breakup before\nreaching the target-depositing\ntheir toxic load where it isn't wanted\nCelltech's approach will be\nto identify and isolate the\nsmallest part of the mab that\nstill retains specificity for\ncancer cells and then\ngenetically engineer these\nfragments with strong bonds\nto the drug.\nThe initial application is\nlikely to be in cancer of the\ncolon, breast and stomach;\nareas that are df fi cult to treat\nusing conventional therapy.\nCelltech expects its mab s to\nbe able to carry imaging\nagents to cancer cells by the\nearly 1990s, and therapeutic\nagents soon after.\nThe Eye Research Insititue\nBaltimore, US has developed\nan alternative to controversial\ni rr it an cy tests on live animals.\nFor 40 years, the household\nproducts and cosmetics\nindustries have used the\nOraize test, an eye i rr it an cy assay performed on albino\nrabbits. The new test differs in\nthat it is done on living cells in\nvitro. Corneal epithelial cells\nare wounded mechanically,\nstained, and then time-lapse\nphotography monitors the rate\nof wound closure. If toxic\nchemicals are introduced, the\nrate of healing slows down,\nproviding a measure of the\ndegree of toxicity. This is not\nonly more socially acceptable\nthan the Draize test, it is also\nmore reliable, says the\nInstitute. Changes on surface\nof the eye in vivo are difficult\nto measure quant it i at iv ely. Saved?\nGalactic Recession\nA survey designed to improve\nthe way astronomers calculate\nthe distance to elliptical\ngalaxies has shown large-scale bulk motions among the\ngalaxies.\nThe survey, conducted by\nseven astronomers from\nall,over the world, covered 390\nelliptical galaxies. It was\nsuccessful in establishing a new distance scale for\nelliptical s, accurate to 23\npercent which is quite good\nfor cosmologists who are quite\npleased if they get the right\nsign, never mind the\nmagnitude.\nHaving found out the\ndistance, they then used the\nHubble law to determine how\nfast the galaxies were\nreceding from the Earth by\ncosmic expansion. They then\nsubtracted that quantity from\nthe observed recession\nvelocity determined by the\ngalaxy's redshift. The\nremainder is purely local\nmotion that indicates how the\ngalaxy is behaving to its\nneighbours.\nBut these local velocities are\nstill relative to the velocity of\nthe Earth. To see how galaxies\nare moving relative to the\nUniverse, the group next\nsubtracted the Earth's velocity\nrelative to the 3K cosmic\nbackground radiation, 600\nkm/s. The result was a bit\nsurprising. Clusters and\nsuperclusters of galaxies are\nstreaming though the universe\nat about 700 km/s. The\nstreaming movement appears\nto be in the direction of the\nHydra Centaurus supercluster\nwhich is moving itself. Is there\nsome huge undiscovered mass\non the other side? We'll have\nto wait and see.\n4 Friday 2 May FELIX\n\n"

Other guests\nat the reception have also told\nFELIX that Ms Hackney's description was accurate.\nRCS Union Broadsheet's Ultra\nViscous Rumours and Dirty Lies\ncolumn also describes Carl as\nbeing 'smashed out of his\nbrain'. Carl dismissed the report\nas gossip.\nMr Burgess told FELIX\nyesterday that he was only\n'slightly in ne bri a ted' and that he\nhad received no complaints\nabout his conduct.\nRag Record\nRag Fete on Saturday raised a record amount of money. The\ntotal raised came to \u00a31804.51 at\nthe first count, though Rag\nChairman elect Man Tai said\nthat money was still coming in.\nThis was double what was\nraised last year.\nThe Fete was opened at 2pm in brilliant sunlight by TV-AM's Ann Diamond.

But\nthe survey also shows that\ngraduates often lack the\ncommunication and business\nskills that employers are looking\nfor.\nIn the survey of 450\nemployers of graduates\npreviewed in the Sunday Times\non April 27, Imperial is placed\nfirst for Physics ahead of\nCambridge and Oxford, and for\nMechanical Engineering ahead\nof Loughborough and Brunei.\nThe College does not make the\ntop ten for Computing,\nhowever, with the honours\ngoing to Manchester and\nUMIST. The accompanying\narticle concentrates on new\ninnovations in engineering\ncourses at Loughborough and\nBrunei, such as thin sandwich\ncourses and the involvement of\nindustrialists, without\nmentioning IC. The full results\nwill published in The Sunday\nTimes Good University Guide in\nJuly.\nMost employers feel that\ngraduates lack both knowledge\nof and interest in the world of\nbusiness and commerce, the\nsurvey shows. They are\ndescribed as inarticulate,\ntongue-tied and even illiterate,\nwith complaints that they lack\ninitiative and the 'real go-get ter killer instinct' that industry\nneeds. The employers call for\ngraduates to be trained to\ncommunicate better, to take\ndecisions and provide\nleadership so called\n'transferable skills'\u2014applicable\nto all areas of industry.\nConcern over the\nGovernment's education policy\nis widely voiced in the survey.\nEmployers feel that they need\nan increasing supply of\ngraduates and are alarmed at\nthe threat of cuts in student\nnumbers. The new innovations\nin courses needed to answer\nthe criticisms of employers will\nalso require resources, which\nare not being made available.\nThe clear message is that\nindustry needs an increase in\nboth the quality and quantity of\ngraduates if it is to become\nmore competitive.\n3 3\n\"U ft\nft\nSL2 ft u Oct ft\nft-\u2022\nFree!

    "content": "i Libyan Squat\nThe Libyan Consulate near\nCollege has been occupied\nby squatters for nearly two\nweeks. Around forty people\nincluding at least one IC\nstudent are believed to be\nliving in the Consulate\nwhich is in Watts Way, the\nroad leading to the\nSouthside halls. The house\nhas been unused for\naround 18 months, and the\nsquatters believe that such\na large building should not\nbe left empty while people\nneed somewhere to live.\nThey hope that the\nConsulate will provide\n1\naccommodation for some\ntime, following the example\nof the Cambodian\nEmbasssy, which has been\nthe home of squatters for\nfive years. The Consulate\nbuilding is thought to be\nthe property of the Crown,\n\\ on a long lease to the\ni Libyan Government.\ni The Consulate,\ni predictably quite grand in\nstyle, is in great disarray\ninside; most of the offices\nhave been thoroughly and\nroughly searched, perhaps\nby British agencies after\nthe Consulate closed, and\nsome of the doors have\nbeen broken down.\nFurniture, office equipment\nincluding several\nphotocopiers and a telex\nmachine are scattered\nabout offices, and\nthousands of copies of\nColonnel Qadhafi's 'Green\nBook' and bundles of\npapers are stacked around\nthe floor of many of the\nrooms.\nThe squatters are keen to\nemphasise that none of the\ndamage is their work, and\nthat they mean to act\nwithin the law. The police,\nwho have visited several\ntimes, seem to have no\nintention to try to remove\nthem, since they have\ncommitted no offence.\nThey have barricaded the\ndoors, however, and most\nof the windows are barred\nand curtained.\nA FELIX reporter was\nallowed into the Consulate\non Wednesday. The\nresidents were starting to\nmove the quantities of\npapers into just a few\nrooms, so that work could\nbegin on making the rest\nhabitable. The utility\nsupplies were then intact,\nand the sq a tter s had\napplied to be supplied with\nelectricity. While the\nreporter was there, though,\nfour men from the LEB arrived, asking to read the\nmeter. Having done so they\nlooked around the house,\nostensibly searching for the\ncause of unsual ly high\npower consumption. On\nleaving , they were\nquestioned by police, some\nnumber of whom had\narrived, as to how many\npeople were inside and on\nother matters. The\nelectricians later returned\nto disconnect the supply,\nso that the squatters now\nhave no heating or light.\nLater that day the LEB dug\nup the pavement outside\nthe building to cut the\nsupply there too. The first\nof the squatters to move in\nwere a group from\nIslington; very few of the\npeople living in the\nConsulate are students.\nLater on Wednesday the\nLEB lifted a cover in the\npavement to cut the supply\nthere too, but it appears\nthat they are prepared to\nreconnect the Consulate if\nthe resident reapply, since\nthe outstanding\nconsumption is not due to\nthe squatters.\nFELIX Editor Hugh Southey attempts to persuade a friend\nto accompany him to Paris after winning the weekend for\ntwo in the Rag raffle on Saturday\n'Fundamental Threat1\nThe British Pugwash group,\nan association of scientists\nconcerned with the threat\nof nuclear war has issued a statement in opposition to\nthe star wars program. They\nare worried that 'SDI may\nrepresent a fundamental\nthreat to academic\nfreedom' and will draw\nresources away from the\nCivil programme. The\ngroup feels that SDI will be\nunlikely to be able to\ndefend populations and\nthey are concerned that\ncertain areas of SDI will not\nwork.\nThe move follows a conference held on April\n14th entitled 'the\nacceptability of SDI\nresearch contracts' The\nconference was attended\nby several academics from\nImperial and a memorandum on SDI\ncirculated by Imperial\nResearch contracts office\nwas included amongst the\nitems for discussion.\nDuring the meeting four\nspeakers spoke both in\nfavour and against SDI\ncontracts. The Ministry of\nDefence was represented\nby Mr Gallagher Daggitt, an\nAssistant Director with\nresponsibility for\nuniversities. He told the\nconference that the Anglo\nAmerican Memorandum of\nunderstanding was a 'business contract' which\nhad been classified for\neconomic reasons. After\nmaking contradictory\nstatements on the financial\nreturns for universities, Mr\nGallagher Daggitt revealed\nthat $100 million was\navailable to be shared\nbetween participating\ncountries and not $2.7\nbillion as had previously\nbeen reported.\nAthletes\nWin\nImperial College won the\noverall London Colleges'\nAthletics championships\nand the men's championships on Tuesday\nand Wednesday. In the\noverall championship\nImperial came first with 143\npoints followed by St\nThomas's with 1141\n/2 points\nand Guys with 92 points.\nFull details will follow.\nSayers\nGets\nExtension\nRevised plans for the\nDepartment of Computing\nextension have been\nreleased. Contrary to\nrumours that the Holland\nClub site would be used,\nthe building will actually be\na free-standing two storey\nstructure on the east side\nof the IC Bookshop. The\nplans also show an addition\nto the first floor, in the\nevent that DoC gets an\nincreased grant for the\nproject.\nFELIX contacted Head of\nDepartment Professor\nSayers on Wednesday\nafternoon, following a DoC\nStaff meeting to discuss the\nproposals. He said that\nmembers of staff were\nconcerned about the\nposition of the new\nbuilding, halfway along the\nWalkway from the main\nDepartment in the Huxley\nBuilding. The Professor\nwas grateful to be given the\nchance to expand the\nDepartment, but felt that it\nwould not fully remove the\nneed for space\nKibble\nEnthuses\nPhysics students seem\nlikely to get a proper\ncommon room to replace\nthe 'Waveguide'. Head of\nDepartment Professor Tom\nKibble is said to be\nenthusiastic about the\nscheme proposed by Dep\nRep Simon Singh. Mr Singh\nhas proposed that the level\n2 corridor be carpeted and\ndecorated At present the\nonly objection to the\nscheme**seems to be the\ncost which has been\nestimated to be \u00a31500.\n16 Friday 2 May FELIX\n\n"

Amidst\nmisquotes and half-quotes\nthe author mentioned my\nname with total contempt\nfive times. This\nunprecedented attack was\ntruly the work of an\nextremist. To scoff at such\n'far reaching, though\ninsufficient reforms' (which\nwere my actual words Mr\nDunlop) as the abolition of\nthe Pass Laws and the\nImmorality Act is typical of\nan extremist dedicated to\nthe violent overthrow of the\nSA Government by the\nMarxist, Soviet-backed\nANC. In fact, these reforms\nstruck the whole heart out\nof the apartheid system.\nBut why didn't you\nanswer the real questions\nin my letter Mr Dunlop?\nWhat about the effect on\nother Southern African\ncountries? Should we\npreserve the highest black\nstandard of living in Africa?\nAnd should we cease\neconomic cooperation with\na developing country?\nAnd the ultimate\nabsurdity was, Mr Dunlop,\nYOU telling ME about\ndemocracy. Well, quite\nfrankly I don't believe you\ngive a damn about\ndemocracy. Perhaps this is\nbecause democracy and\ncapitalism work too well\ntogether to accommodate\nyour support for violent\nMarxist terrorism.\nIt is time to take an\nuninhibited look at\napartheid. The traditional\nimage of it as an extreme\nright wing philosophy is\nfalse. More accurately it\ncan be described as ethnic\nsocialism, a system\ninvolving state control\ndown to every last detail.\nImplementation of the\ncorrespondingly policies\nhave traditionally drawn\nmany parallels with other\nextreme socialist states.\nThis is totally incompatible\nwith liberation capitalist\nvalues of multinationals\nsuch as Barclays. It is in\ntheir best interests, and\ntheir inherent nature to\ndestroy apartheid. They\nca not exist in a system of\ninherited racial division\nwhich inhibits freedom of\nmovement and labour and\nrequires them to be\nsubservient to the state.\nThe aim of the ANC which is no longer\ninterested in negotiated\nsettlement is to seek a solution by force. They, like\nyou Mr Dunlop, wish to\nforce SA blacks to\nrevolution, and are\ncorrespondingly terror ising the black SA population to\nmilitancy with a campaign\nof muggings and murder of\ntheir own people. If this\nterror campaign succeeds,\nhelped along by\nd is investment, extremists\nwill have won the race and\nthe attempts to get rid of\napartheid will be\nabandoned. Don't vote for\nmore extremism in SA\nthey've had enough\nalready.\nFinally Mr Dunlop,\nanswer me this which bank\nin SA.\n1 Donates 5% of its\nearnings to a social\nresponsibility programme\nfor the benefit of the black\ncommunity?\n2 Opened the first branch\nin Soweto-against the law?\n3 Appointed the fist black\ncashier in SA-against the\nLaw?\n4 Appointed the first black\nmanager-against the law?\n5 Established multi-racial\ntraining-against the law.\n6 Was the first bank in SA\nto introduce equal pay for\nequal work?\n7 Represents 25% of SA\nbanking system but\nemploys 43% of the total\nnumber of non-whites in\nbanking?\n(PS its not the 'vol sik as' bank which employs 1%)\nYes Mr Dunlop, its the one\nyou love to hate,\nBARCLAYS National\nYours sincerely\nJohn Martin\n\"1\nApplications are invited for the post of\nSub-Warden\nSouthwell House\nThe succesful applicant will be a postgraduate student with at least one year\nremaining at Imperial College.\nFree accommodation is provided.\nPlease apply, with relevant details and\nexperience, in writing to:\nMr KV Young (warden)\n58B Evelyn Gardens\nLondon SW7\nClosing date for applications is Fridav 16\nMay 1986\nMorelowcostfares!\nto more places\n/ Go your own way7 \u2022 B MUL U Travel H imperial College, Sherfield Building,\nPrince Consort Road, London SW7 Tel: 01-581 8882\nA Service of\n^tH MM kW^ k ST A Travel the wor|d s^^I9m \u00ab leading organisation for\n^ W II J HM independent youth and\n\u2022 Mk^^m^ student travel\nTheWorldbeaters /FOKT0-If you're crossing the finals\nfrontier remember STA Travel is for, Graduates too! f&r \"fp\\\nFELIX Friday 2 May 3\n\n"

    "content": "Gems. The latest films by Jim Clayden.\nJewel of the Nile\n(practically everywhere)\ncontinues the story where\nRomancing the Stone left\noff, you didn't see it?\nWell...romantic novelist,\nJoan Wilder, and\nadventurer, Jack Colton,\nhave met in South America\nand fallen made ly in love.\nJewel of the Nile finds\nthem six months later in\nthe South of France and\nsome of the tensions of\nsharing a yacht for such a long time are begin nig to\nshow. Joan, Kathleen\nTurner, is required to go\nashore to a publishers\nparty and there she meets a romantic Arab leader who\nwishes to whisk her off to\nwrite his story, just like a plot of a novel she could\nhave written. Unfortunately\nthe Arab is ab addy( gasp)\nand soon Jack Michael\nDouglas, and the good\nArabs are pitted against the\nbad Arabs.\nLike Romancing the\nStone it doesn't take itself\ntoo seriously and there are\nplenty of jokes, often from\nDanny De Vito, the tiny\ntyrant from 'Taxi', whose\nsole motivation in this film\nappears to be greed. The\nscript however lacks the\nsparkle of the original and\nover all the film doesn't come across as quite as\nengaging. There is however\nplenty of action as one of\nthe problems of filming in\nthe desert is that you need\na lot of activity to fill the\nwide open spaces.\n(Amongst the props\nrequired were server al guns\nand mortars and a mock F16 aircraft which apparently\ncaused some consternation\nin customs as the country\nwhere it was filmed was at\nwar the time.)\nKathleen Turner is one of\nthe better and more\nattractive actresses around\nat the moment, capable of\ndoing the comedy with\nsuperb timing The Man\nwith Two Brains and\nmanipulation seduction\nBody Heat and all\ncharacters inbetween. Her\nroles are always very\ncapable and independent\npeople, and in spite of\nplaying a writer of romantic\nfiction Joan Wilder is far\nfrom the stereotypes of that\ngenre.\nMichael Douglas is not\nquite as talented, although\ncute and quite fun, he\ndoesn't really possess the\nability to convey a great\nrange of emotions very\ndeeply, but this part doesn't call for too much effort so\nhe copes well enough.\nThe director, Lewis\nTeague, not only directed\ntwo major films previously\nboth of them Stephen King\nadaptations, Cujo and Cats\nEyes, but he proves himself\nto be very capable of\nhandling both comedy and\naction, and he provides\nsome of the most intelligent\nuse of the widescreen\nformat I 've seen for a long\ntime.\nWilliams is a name given to\na cop who has been\nkidnapped and given a new\nface in order that he can\nwork for a secret\norganisation whose\npurpose is to eliminate\nundesirables and whose\nonly responsibility is to the\nPresident. (Appropriately\nhis name comes from a device used to collect\nexcrement). The\nundesirable.in this case is\nan arms manufacturer who\nis turning out cheap and\nshoddy weapons in order\nto maximise his profit.\nAdmittedly as a result of\nthe poor quality of one of\nhis rifles a soldier is killed,\nbut the film emphasises his\nfinancial crimes, such as\ntaking money for a satellite\nweapon that he has no\nintention of completing.\nIn order to carry out the\nelimination of this man,\nRemo is trained in the\nancient martial arts by the\nracist and sexist, Chiun, in\norder that he make the\ndirectors death seem\naccidental. Why a marital\nRemo sorts out the rats in his kitchen.\nThe good photography\nand lively soundtrack make\nit a pleasant, but none too\nspecial film though it is\ngood to see juggling taking\nit's proper place in cinema.\nRemo, Unarmed and\nDangerous, provides me\nwith another excuse for a tirade about American\nmorality as depicted in\ntheir movies, particular\nones that have names in\nthe title that begin in 'R' and end in 'O'. It would\nseem that an appraisal of\nAmerican Society's priorities were made on the\nbasis of the film (highly\nunrepresentative and\nunfair, I know) then\nembezzlement and fraud\nare considered greater\ntransgressions than murder\nand the punishment are a little Draconican.\nAnyway, the plot: Remo\narts expert is better able to\ndo this than anyone else is\none of the many mysteries\nof this film, as is why the\nMajor is allowed to wear\nred still et to s on duty.\nHowever it does provide\nthe film with some amusing\nlines from Chiun's offhand\nremarks. Chuin is played\nby Joel Grey who played\nthe MC In Cabaret but you\nprobably wouldn't recognise him unless\nsomeone told you.\nSomeone told me.\nIt is directed by a veteran\nfrom Bad movies, Guy\nHamilton, so it has some\nstyle and humour but it\ndoesn't really succeed on\nany level, particularly the\nrelationship between Chiun\nand Remo, in spite of, and\nmaybe because of, trying\nseveral different ideas at\nonce.\n8 Friday 2 May FELIX\n\n"

Almost half said\nthat they would be, and\nover a half of these said\nthat they would owe more\nthan \u00a3200. Half of the\nmoney borrowed by\nstudents is from banks, and\na third by parents. The\nlarge amount of borrowing\nfrom parents plus the large\nproportion of people\ndependent upon their\nparents to make up the\nshortfall in their grant\nindicate quite clearly that\nthe dismal student support\nsystem in this country is\npreventing students from\ngetting real independance,\nand thus hindering their\ncomplete education.\nA particularly startling\nstatistic is that 59 of the\n2005 people in the sample\nanticipated being more\nthan \u00a32000 in debt by the\ntime they left college. I wish that the report gave a more detailed breakdown\non these particular cases,\nbecause they are evidence\nof something quite serious.\nWhat in from ation is given\nshows that these cases fall\nCollege Accomodation\nservice\nULU Accomodation\nservice\nStudent Union notice\nboard\nStudent Union\nOfficer\nUniversity or college\nnoticeboard\nFriends or\nrelatives\nNewspaper\nadverts\nAccomodation or\nestate agents\nShop\nwindow\nOne of the survey results\n10% 20% 30% 40=\nneatly into two categories:\nthose with very high\n(\u00a35000pa or more) incomes\nand those whose incomes\nare very low or even non-existant.\nAccommodation\npreferences: College halls\nof residence which provide\nmeals are unpopular. Only\none in five occupying these\ndo so out of choice.\nConversely intercollegiate\nThe Rector\nwill address the\nAnnual General\nMeeting\nof the\nAcademic Staff\nAssembly\nat 1pm on Wednesday 14th May\nin ME 220\nhalls were very popular\nwith their residents: about\nhalf of them regard them as\nthe best place to live.\nOnly 4% ticked 'I do not\nmind sharing a room'.\nAbout 80% of all types of\nstudents did have their own\nroom, except for those in\ncollege flats/houses, where\nmore than 50% had to\nshare. In fact, college flats\nand houses seemed rather\nunpopular in general, with\na third of their residents\ncomplaining that they\ndidn't have adequate\nfacilities for study, and they\nwere also heavily criticised\nfor lack of space and poor\nheating. The only way in\nwhich they scored was in\ntheir relative freedom from\nrules and restrictions.\nThere was no appreciable\ndifference between home\nand overseas students\nwhen 4 came to expressing\nsatisfaction in general with\naccommodation standards,\nneither was there much\ndifference in this respect\nbetween students with\ndifferent levels of\nincome\u2014luckily\nexpectations and reality\nseem to coincide.\nStudents at Imperial\nstood out as more willing\nthan most to pay more than\nat present to get better\naccommodation; nearly\n25% would like to do this,\nagainst a University\naverage of 16%. Only 36%\nclaimed to be unable to pay\nmore rent than at present,\nagainst a University figure\nof nearly half. This at first\nseems to contradict the\nwidely held view that\nstudents here have to pay\nmore than average for their\naccommodation. The\nreason may be that IC has\na relatively large proportion\nof students in college\nflats/houses, which have\nbeen shown above to be\ncheap but relatively\nunpopular. A good\nproportion of the students\nwanting to pay for better\nac como dati on may be in\nthese.\nFinding somewhere: The\nsurvey contained questions\non how accommodation\nwas found. The procedure\nfor getting into a coll gea c como dati on is well\ndefined, but hopefully the\nfollowing should help to\nprovide those who will be\nlooking for somewhere in\nthe private sector which\nstrategy is most effective.\nThese figures are for all\nLondon University\nstudents, but I can't think\nof any reason why IC\nshould be atypical. One\npoint in which we differ\nfrom the average is that our\nown college\naccommodation service is\nmuch more popular than\nthe one run by the\nUniversity in Malet St,\nBloomsbury. This may be\nbecause the existence of\nthe University service is not\nwidely known here, but\ncompounding this is the\nway that the University\nservice emerges as badly\nrun, and I feel that most of\nthose who do know about it\ndon't feel that it's worth the\ntravel.\nConclusion: Sometimes we\nat Imperial forget that in\nsome respects we are\nbetter off than those at\nother colleges, despite\nsome of the problems of\nbeing in central London\nand an area of high rents\nand high land costs. IC has\na relative abundance of\ncollege accommodation,\neven if a proportion of it is\nflats and houses.\nUnfortuantely the overall\npicture is gloomy, with low\nincomes getting lower and\nhigh rents getting higher.\nAt least in commissioning\nthis report, which must\nhave cost quite a lot, the\nUniversity has shown that it\nis not inflexible and is\nprepared to listen to what\nst due nts want and need,\nand to find the true nature\nof the problems faced. I, for\none, hope that what\nproblems can be solved are\ntackled, and the good\nintentions are carried\nturned into effective\npolicies.\nFELIX Friday 2 May 7\n\n"
